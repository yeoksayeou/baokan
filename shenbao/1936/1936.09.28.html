<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國外交與區域安全</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>英國沙理斯波雷侯爵曾謂。「政治上最普通的錯誤。就在依附着陳腐政策的屍體。」目前英國的外交。似乎還不肯擺脫這樣的錯誤。英國戰後抑法揚德政策。顯已在歐洲大陸造成不安的局勢了。現在不但德國飛揚跋扈。而意國也像古代的羅馬人一樣。有視地中海為「我們的海」的趨勢。在夾攻中的英國。究主張民主國聯合起來。以抵抗法西主義呢。抑虛與法西主義委蛇。以保全大英帝國以往的權威呢。時間已不允許其再維持以往那種曖昧的態度。環境已逼迫其必須有明顯的主張。然而就保守黨內部的各領袖的主張講。仍是意見紛歧。莫衷一是。保守黨反對派邱吉爾主張英法兩民主國家應共同聯合。以保衛民主主義的遺產。而對付法西主義的威脅。邱吉爾那樣的主張。固也有相當的聲勢。不過與掌權的保守黨人如包爾溫張伯倫輩的主張。郤大相逕庭。今日英國保守黨中。我們不可忽視的。卽為財相張伯倫。我們知道保守黨現任黨魁包爾溫雖仍居首相的一職。然而他的退休。不過時間問題。而保守黨黨魁及首相的繼任人選。張伯倫實最有希望。張伯倫旣已變為保守黨的靈魂。張氏的主張。自有注意的必要了。</p>
<p>講到財相張伯倫的主張。我們可由今年六月在「一九〇〇年俱樂部」的演說中。窺其一斑。他說。「集體制度旣因意阿戰爭而遭嚴重的失敗。那末最妥當的辦法。還是尋求世界危險地帶「區域化」的可能性。而擬出一個處置的方案。這種方案。應由那些與危險地帶有切身關係的國家。從事擔保。而由國聯予以通過。」換句話設。卽是拿戰爭區域化來代替所謂集體安全。拿區域安全公約來代替國聯盟的。這種主張更可由最近英國外相艾登在本屆國聯大會中的演說。得一事實的證明。據艾登說。「依英政府的意見。區域協定。可以增强國聯盟的的實施。故英政府决計與西歐各國談判此種恊定。」這話雖極簡單。然而已足够我們看出今後英國外交的趨向了。今後英國對歐洲的外交。大概不外繼承倫敦協定的遺緒。一面締結西歐區域公約。使德國就範。以保障英國北境的安全。一面締結地中海區域公約。使意大利就範。以保持地中海上英國的優勢。英國這種如意算盤。能吾實現。照目前的形勢看來。大是疑問。意大利因國聯允許阿國代表出席本屆國聯大會。深為不滿。德國對於英國四月二十七日所提出的關於西歐十一條約問題。迄未答復。故在倫敦召集的新羅加諾會議前途還渺茫得很。至於五國會商可獲怎樣的結果。當然更談不到了。</p>

<h3>京郊農村經濟　略見轉機</h3>

<h3>佛郎貶值結果　生活指數提高　內長指令各區　防範投機漁利</h3>
<p>（巴黎）衆料佛郎之貶值、將使法國生活代價為之提高、另一結果、為法蘭西銀行之金準備折合新佛郎價後、政府可因以獲極大之利、若政府决將佛郎貶值百分之三十、則所獲之數的遠一萬五千萬鎊、此欵將用以充穩定匯率基金及賠償損失與津貼經費、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）衆議院財政委員會主席范利安（正統派社會黨議員）頃向本社訪員發表談話、對於英法美三國成立貨幣協定之舉、表示滿意、謂各國貨幣普泛穩定、以及法國經濟復興、均已於此見其端倪、殊可慶幸、「余希望各國現行進口限額制度、不久歸於消滅、現行進口稅率、亦可減低、庶幾國際貿易得以擴充、而吾國一部份工業現在改組中者、亦得趨於發達也」、結論則謂衆議院財政委員會、對於政府在貨幣方面所採各項措置、定必以極大多數加以贊同云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法國波爾多港　共產黨秘書長多萊士、頃發表談話稱、該黨對於國務總理所推行之新貨幣政策、均當積極加以贊助、但要求規定工資累進率、俾生活捐數漲高之時、工人工資、如與之適應云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>瑞士步法後塵　决定實行貶值</h3>
<p>瑞士京城　瑞士政府決議貶其佛郎之值、據今日公報宣稱、政府現殊注意法政府議請國會核准貶低佛郎之值的百分之三十之舉、又稱、瑞士國家銀行地位鞏固、其金準備力能長久應付對瑞士佛郎所作之攻聲、惟在環境壓迫之下、瑞士貶值之舉稍遲必不可免、再、列强現正作穩固匯率之企圖、如瑞士步武法國、必可利用此項企圖、故政府特於今日正午决議實行貶值云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>瑞士京城　自計畫中之法佛郎貶值消息傳出後、使瑞士佛郎有整理之必要、經瑞士聯邦政治四小時會議後、已將必需第略起草完竣、將在週內一向國會提出、</p>
<p>聯邦政治會議後、即發出下列通吿、「自法政府議決將佛郎減低幣值百分之三十後、瑞士聯邦政洽會議以為為瑞士國家經濟利益起見、有整理瑞士貨幣、以適應世界重要幣制之必要、」（廿六日國民電）</p>
<h3>比國參加協定　巴黎表示感慰</h3>

<h3>意國貨幣政策　勢將重行考慮</h3>
<p>（羅馬）就意人目光中觀察、瑞士之決議抑低幣值、已大變歐洲貨幣之大局、衆信意國為應付歐洲貨幣之重行整理起見、對於其不抑低里拉之值之决心、或不得不加以考量、意內閣巳定星期二日召集非常會議、討論政府應以何種計畫重定其財政政策、此間負責各界對於英美法所成立之國際貨幣協定、殊為歡迎、因可導成國際貿易之復興、而各國貨幣亦因以更可相平也、三國今尚未請意國加入協定、但如接此項請書、意國將以合作之精神研究之、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）關於英法美三國締結貨幣協定一事、此間金融界人士均採保留態度、不加評論、按意國現雖仍為金本位集團國之一、但實際上紙幣已不復兌現、意大利銀行對於業務狀況、亦久不發表報吿、以故里拉準備率、究為百分之幾、無人知之、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德持鎭靜態度　財策不欲變更</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國負責之財政界對於法佛郎之貶值，雖鎮靜處之、但各報則大為張皇、其登載此項新聞之標題、使讀者戚覺法國將陷於財政於政治之恐慌、今舉數則、可見一斑、如「法國嚴重之愛慮」、「人民陣綫之大弊端發現矣」、「工資增加現已减其價值」之類是也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）法國佛郎貶值、此間報章均有特別紀載、各報在評論　及經濟版均有長文批評此策略之重要性、一般意見均謂觀乎法國財政狀況之困難、佛郎整理是不可免之事實、關於此策略對馬克反射之可能性、各報均一致指出德國、經濟情況之穩定、佛郎貶值未必引起德國有更改目前財政政策之必要、</p>
<p>「德國晚報」謂「吾人在觀察者地位、希望此困難財政策略能獲成功、因其失敗祇有增加現在歐洲之惡勢力」、並調德國經濟情形之穩定、沙赫德計畫及在紐倫堡所宜布之四年計畫之保證、外交及財政秩序井然、使德國深覺無改變政策之必要、「柏林交易報」謂德國經濟界對於法新策略之發展、及其對世界經濟之影響、能取靜觀而不急慮態度、該報並謂「德國因新計畫及外匯國貨幣總制、佛郎貶值是無直接影響、該報最後謂德國當局對此新策略之鎮靜態度、可由一事見之中央銀行總裁沙赫德博士在該日尚有時問參與薩爾布律克之經濟會議、（二十六日同盟電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯拋出金鎊　美國如數購進</h3>
<p>（紐約）蘇聯方面昨向此間市塲、拋售英鎊一百萬鎊、當由美國財政部如數購進、藉免影響匯市、英法美三國貨幣協定、業已發生實效、於此可見、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜今日宣佈、蘇俄政府曾以英金一百萬鎊、在外匯市塲出售、不限價格、已由美國全數購進、毛氏並稱、據當時之情形觀之、顯然有人欲抑低鎊價、經過詳細調查、始悉蘇俄國家銀行以百萬金鎊、不限價格出售、美國當即以平衡基金悉數購進、按一國政府或一家銀行、欲單獨故意影響美國外匯市塲、此次猶屬創舉、財長竭誠希望以後不再有類此之事發生、有人問財長、蘇俄銀行何故出此、財長答稱、「惟有就詢蘇俄政府」云、按財部宣佈此種消息、亦屬空前之舉、當時財長並促報界訪員於市塲閉市之前、速即發表云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長摩甘索宣稱、美國今日購入蘇俄政府在匯市出售之英金的一百萬鎊、財長謂英美法所訂新貨幣協定、志在穩定金融、現已請他國合作、惟今晨渠悉有人力圖壓低鎊價、探詢之下、知蘇俄國家銀行命見最好之價叩任何價出售英金一百萬鎊、財長謂報界中人、謂渠將盡其限量維持美英法三國貨幣互相匯兌之穩固、或問「限量」之義、財長答曰、「二十萬萬美元是也」、按二十萬萬美元即穩定匯率之基金數、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<h3>美認佛郎貶值　確具有建設性</h3>
<p>（紐約）垣街今日歡迎法國貶值計畫、稱為確有建設性、今日世界重要證券交易所、獨紐的者開市、惟紐的銀行與世界主要中心點如倫敦等處銀行同、均中止星期杪之外匯交易、證券交易頗旺、各價漲高一至三磅音不等、因法國貶值與三國貨幣協定皆利於多方也、若干交易者勸人當謹慎從事、以待佛郎更變之效果、更可明鑒、而允防外資之運回、但亦有人相信金融不穩定之局勢、既獲解决、則可長久受海外貶易之良好影響、且將為趨向世界復原之一步驟、消息靈通各界皆謂法國資金不致突然巨量運回、經紀人報吿今日外國買賣之數的可相平、晨間英鎊所引起之人心不安、經財長摩甘索發表宣言後、即歸平靜、蘇俄售出巨數英鎊、均經美國穩定匯率基金處購入、棉花之價初因歐洲方面稍有購入而漲高、繼因一部分了結而回跌、後又因外國購入而後漲、惟將近收盤時、顯有套賣者、收乘時價頗穩定、高於前一日收盤價自七磅音至四磅音不等、芝加哥小麥因廠家購入、外國頻頻來電詢問、價初漲、旋回跌一部分、收盤價與昨日同、交易所皆視法國之貶值終必利於多方、二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>倫敦報紙評論　耶戰重要步驟</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於佛郎貶值事、昨日各晚報與本日各晨報均加以評論、其中自由黨機關報「明星報」載稱、「一九三三年世界經濟會議不幸夭折以還、英法美三國日昨所締結之貨幣協定、實乃最堪滿意之事、標準晚報載稱、「英法兩國匯兌率、平時每鎊的合七十五法郎、原與英鎊眞正價值不相符合·茲佛郎既已貶值、其與英鎊之比價自可較近實際、即美元與佛郎之比價、前此亦在眞正價值之下、」此外本日各報均謂、各國貨幣今後既可普泛穩定、即法國國內政治經濟商業、亦可在短時期之內加以改善、抑世界戰爭所由引起、實以經濟戰爭為之厲階、今後亦必消弭於無形、泰晤士報星期特刋載稱、「法國歷屆內閣均未能平衡預算、因而財政狀況至為不穩、迨至白倫出而組閣、乃不得不出於貶值之途、目下問題乃英鎊與黃金現仍不相關連、其與佛郎之匯率究應如何加以規定、此項匯率大抵當在一百佛郎至一百〇五佛郎之間、假定法國對英匯率為一百零二佛郎、對美匯率為二十一佛郎、則英鎊對美匯率、即為四元八角六分六矣」云、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>經濟會議前途　東京方面觀察</h3>
<p>（東京）荷蘭亦於二十七日追隨法國之貶價、決定禁止運金出口、於是純粹之金本位國家、現今世上已完全沒落、各國之說聽行將集中於世界經濟會議矣、現綜合日本匯兌銀行友面之視測、大致如左、</p>
<p>今後世界各國為脫離黃金起見、將行使自由之通貨、結果各國匯兌行市均表現於綜合國力之反映而其通貨關係首由比率决定、反為顛倒本末者也、蓋國內與國際間之實情尚未清理、而首先提出通貨協定之問題、縱令即行召開世界經濟會議、以圖訂立通貨協定、亦不能得到任何成果、世界通貨今後既處於自由關係、則日金之地位究應置於何處、據一部分人土之觀察、認為日本匯兌管理法已將日金置於實勢以上之高等地位、可再行斟酌改訂管理法、亦不無此項意見、此事由大藏當局在明白表示對英幣一先令年便士之政策不變時、頗堪注目者也云、（二十七日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>歐洲貨幣變動　影響巴西匯市</h3>
<p>巴西　此間一切關於貨幣之交易、除絕對重要者外、一律暫行停止、至星期二日為止、據一般人意見、以為佛郎貶值之影響、或將使米爾里斯（葡萄牙及巴西之金幣名稱）之正式掛牌匯價、發生變化云、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>怎樣提倡農村副業（下）</h3>
<p>— 中央農業實驗所副所長錢天鶴</p>
<p>（丙）要有適當原料無錫江蘇省立教育學院提倡編織草地氈，幾年以來，編識的技術已不亞於廣東貨，但是它的原料來自蘇州滸墅關，染起顏色來不能和廣東所產的原料那樣均勻好看，因此外國人情願買廣東貨，不情願買無錫貨。又如首都實驗民衆教育館提倡農村副業，而購買草帽鞭，教農民編織書包及草帽，却因草帽　買自外埠，雖然工資輕微，但加上運費，成本已經很大，價格比市塲上的不能低廉，銷路當然不能推廣了。所以要提倡副業，本地最好要有適當的原料，至少到外面去買，價格是低廉的，又不患供給缺乏的。</p>
<p>（丁）要能儘量利用本地自然環境江蘇句容縣的下　鎮，附近有幾個山，出產製造砂缸的泥土，並且有燒缸最好的燃料松樹，這種自然環境，就該儘量利用，一方面在製缸的技術上努力改進，運輸上圖求便利，一方面擴充原有的缸窰，添築新寚，以增加生產。如果貨色好了，運輸便了，成本減輕，價格就可削低，推廣當然也容易了。再如江蘇鎮江附近高資鎮的白石（俗稱高資石），很合建築高貴房屋的用途，如鐵路局能減輕運費，附近的農民，肯利用農暇，不辭辛苦，把石頭打成大小合宜的石版或石塊，運銷外埠，保險是可以獲利的。所以要提倡農村副業，要能儘量利用自然的環境。</p>
<p>（二）提倡農村副業的方法</p>
<p>（甲）政府的提携　過去對於農村副業的經營，政府簡直很少留意過或提携過完全是讓一般農民拚命運式的幹着，說不上有政策，更談不到有組織，都是人自為政，各不相謀，以致近年來受國際間經濟勢力的波及，一般副業，竟望風披靡的崩潰了。所以今後政府如再不設法提携，則農村副業的失敗，更將不堪設想。如何提携，不外獎勵，指導，督促和統制四方面。「獎勵」的用意是在提倡，譬如前面說的紙傘，以前銷到外國去的很少，現在却因製造技術的改良運銷南洋羣島的一天多似一天，政府在這初出口的時候，除關稅應該一律免去外，並且還要用文字在報紙上表揚，或逕用物質獎勵。「指導」是在乎為農民策劃，因政府對於世界大勢，，國內情形，在在比農民熟悉，所以那種副業有希望，什麼地方應做什麽副業，和什麽副業應該怎樣進行等，都應該給農民策劃，並指導農民去做。「督促」在乎使農民善用剩餘時間和勞力，譬如政府認定某一地方的農民應以打石子為副業，但農民不是個個勤懇服從的，所以一定要加以督促。副業的產品，如漫無限制的生產，很容易失敗，所以一定要政府的「統制」。譬如檯氈的銷路廣，就命令以檯氈副業的人加速出品，如猪肉市塲慘跌，並且短時間很少有復興希望時，趕快通知做養猪的副業的人，這樣可以避免供過於求求過於供的弊端。</p>
<p>（乙）農工業機關　技術指導　我們提倡農村副業，如果這種副業的技術不高明，出品就一定不優良，銷路也就隨之不振，所以要某種副業發展，則某種副業的技術必先講究。那末講究技術，農民還要延　技師不成？這當然做不到。那末由政府請專門人材釗各農村去指導？副業的種類繁多，各項專門人才固難羅致，就是國家的經濟力也夠不上。所以指導的工作，只有全國各地的農工業機關來担當。譬如大城市附近的農民，很多以種蔬果為副業，甚或正業，但他們只知道墨守舊法，栽培上既不知改良，販賣上又不能組織化，出賣不掉的時候，更不知道加工製造，這種地方，當地的農工業機關，就應該分別的担任指導。栽培法的改良如提早應市等，販賣時組織運銷合作社，不使商人壟斷等工作，由農業機關担任指導；新鮮產品出賣不掉而需要加工製造時，由工業機關担任指導。</p>
<p>（丙）工業界的善為利用我國現在的工業，除掉極少數的以外，還徘徊在家庭工業和近代化工業之間，換句話說，就是我國的工業，雖有若干巳有近代化的外形，但實質還未全脫家庭工業的精神。因此一般工廠應該善為利用農民的過剩時間和勞力，去做不用機器做的一部分工作，工廠方面既可以低價收買，農民方面因為有可靠的收入，亦樂得而為之，所以是兩蒙其利。譬如草情鞭，每年銷到外國去的很多，可是價格並不高，所以外國人收買去之後，加工製造成各種草帽，銷行世界各國甚至又運到我國來，賣責的價錢，一轉手之間，竟獲大利。我們為什麽不自己編草帽楩，再加工做成草帽等銷售外洋及本國，不是可以得到一筆大收人，並杜塞一筆　巵嗎？漂白草帽鞭，織草帽等，現在我國未始不會做，但銷售外洋的，可稱絕無僅有。假使工廠方面能特的農村編織草帽　，再　究漂白和編織的方法，不但可使國人見而愛用，運銷到外洋去，因為物美價廉，也或許可以暢銷哩。所以工業界善為利用農民的過剩時間和勞力，是提倡農村副業方法之一。</p>
<p>（丁）農民的組織化　農民的沒有組織，什麽地方都吃虧，也就是農村脆弱的大原因。丹麥是歐洲一個小國家，在十九世紀初年，亦像現在的我國一樣被人蔑視欺侮，嗣後有一位格龍維先生，鑑於國家的衰落，完全繁於民衆的無組織，因此就和他的信徒們，自一八三八年起開始拋棄他們的舒適生活，刻苦經營民衆等學校，訓練民衆，領導民衆，使民衆都有組識，如購買農具和日用品，有生產消費合作社，推銷農產品，有運銷合作社，存欵和借欵，有信用合作社，差不多什麽事都是組織化，不論買進賣出的東西，中間商人完全不得染指；並且農民有組織後，就發生出英大力量，這種力量，就是復興民族，發展民權和解決民生的基礎。所以到了十九世紀末葉，差不多全國的國民都富裕了，國家也強盛了，以前蔑視他欺侮他的，現在也不敢蔑視他欺侮他了。由此可見，農民——甚至全民衆——的組織化，比槍砲子彈還來得厲害，我想應該用全力向這條路上邁進，最近我國政府已開始法重壯丁訓練，不容說這壯丁訓練是組織民衆，雖然訓練方式或有不同，但其目的總是在達到民衆組織化。這是復與中，尤其是大多數的農民，不特要接受政府的好意，並且要自覺的奮勇的出來組織。說了這一大段話，似乎和提倡農村副業沒有關係，其實在整個的農民組織化了，就有無限大的力量。農村副業就可在有政策有組織之下努力，如購買原洋組織購買合作社，日常消費組織消費合作社，運銷出品組織運銷合作社，流通資金組織信用合作社等等，假使有外力侵入，更可從容抵抗。在這種情形之下提倡農村副業，還有不成功之理嗎？</p>
<p>不過組識農民不是件容易的事，尤其要使組織健全有力量，更不是短期間所能奏效。現在我國全國各種合作社、據中央農業實騐所民國二十四年年底的統計有二萬六千二百二十四社，較之二十三年增加了一萬一千餘社（見農情報告四卷二期），數量甚屬可觀，但考其內容，可說十九是不能滿人意的，並且是被動的，這種被動的組織，怎麽會發生力量，所以距合作社的目的遙遠得很哩。現在因為時間限制，關於組織農民的途徑，不想多發揮，但　括言之，政府有組織農民的决心，社會人士有贊助的熱心，和農民本身有徹底的覺悟，農民組織化，短期間也不愁無成。以後隨便要他們做什麽，都很容易，要提倡農村副業更不成問題了。（完）</p>

<h3>日人南進政策聲中　滿鐵勢力深入福建　乘勘察鐵鑛機會分三班積極活動　探測廈門港灣擬建鐵路用意叵測</h3>
<p>福州訊、去年十月間、福建省政府當局、為開發閩省鑛產、特向日本南滿鐵道會社、聘請技師、歷在閩南安溪潘田一帶實行勘測、據當局表示、此舉完全是技術上的依賴、對于主權亳無侵害、滿鐵派來的技術人員、除在潘田設處勘測安溪鐵鑛外、同時並計劃建築閩南鐵道、經數度調查踏勘之後、因地方不靖、土匪橫行、及其他各種關係、乃暫吿停頓、將機器寄存鼓浪嶼、準備明年四月、再行繼續工作、吾人固信任閩省政府維護主權之苦心、但允不得不注意　滿鐵勢力將乘此機會　伸入全福建之危機、因將該社派員入閩經過及工作情形、概述如下、藉以喚起關心華南國防者之注意、</p>
<p>查滿鐵派赴閩省　實行勘測鑛產者、計有中川喜久郎及板本峻雄等　共二十而人、于去年十月間抵閩、其中除中川喜久郎係滿鐵事務員外、內中尚有五人非技術人員、如范見司池忠常二人係廈門日領館職員、福山係海軍中校航空員、磯端伴造相馬英雄二人、亦係日本海軍界人物、非技術人員而派赴勘測鑛產、其用意之深、可不言而喻、</p>
<p>探測安溪鐵餒之日人共分三班、第一為港灣班、該班由相馬英雄領導、一抵廈門即開始　勘測廈門沿海港灣、繼而由九龍口入海處、漳州之江東橋探測至發源止、所經過之閩南縣份、由龍溪長泰華安漳平再入安溪　勘查蘭溪溪流、除蘭溪及廈門沿海勘測完竣外、至九龍江因受各縣民衆激烈反對、故只勘測一段而罷、然而廈門島要塞港灣、已詳細測繪無遺矣、廈門與台灣僅有一水之隔、與日本代管島相距亦近、內可以控制華南沿海各地、外可以作為侵略南洋羣島之根據、由此可見所謂港灣班任務之重大了、第二為鐵道班計劃中之閩南鐵道路綫、係由安溪潘田起經漳平·華安·長泰·龍溪·而達嵩嶼出海、全錢共長三五·〇華里、本來該路綫若改由同安之集美　而至安溪之潘田、全綫長而〇〇華里、不但路綫縮短三份之一、而且中間道途平坦可免于小嶺高峻之處、開隧道架空索等工程，但日方計劃並不止此、因他不　垂涎安溪鐵鑛、且欲順便採掘漳平隣縣龍岩之有名無烟煤，並企圖把該路兩端延長、一邊伸入廣東省、一邊橫貫福建上游入江西與南濤路接軌、與英國最近成立的粵漢路接軌、並駕齋驅、伸入華中、第三為測鑛及試錐班、該班除探測潘田外、還附帶調查附近各鑛、潘田鐵鑛位在安溪縣之西北、離縣城一五華里、山高出海的三百尺、鑛區週圍的十華里、該鑛為露天鐵鑛山頭露出之碉岩、即是鑛苗、鑛苗的成份、最高有百分之九十、最低也有百分之五五、鐵質磁鐵最多、赤戲决之、硫磺鐵不多、該鑛自宋朝起、即有本地人採鑛、用土法鍊後、售之于市、可是經過長時間只開了一些、還剩下有四千萬噸、每噸以值十五元算、總數共達六萬萬元、此外在附近距離五六十里內尚有許多鑛產、如南陽之鉛鑛、鑛質亦不劣、蘊存量有一千萬噸、現由當地資本家組織公司開採、所採之苗運賣香港外商、供製鉛筆用、隣近靠西南珍地鐵鑛、高坪附近之硫磺·銅鑛·石炭鑛、蘊藏亦均豐富、但滿鐵勢力深入之後，此大好資源、是否將仍為我有、誠一大疑問也、</p>

<p>黎照寰詞木社是國內創立最早的學術團體中一僩經濟學社、今天舉行第十三屆年會、鄙人謹代表理事部同人幷以中華基督教靑年會全國協會會長的資格代表該會、歡迎諸位光臨這個紀念堂、我們既欣欣來參加大會、必定能竭誠合作、使本屆會議成功、鄙人敢信此會對於世界的經濟思想、和我國政府的經濟建設、都有相當的貢獻、本屆所提出討論的、是在目前危急存亡的時候、國人所應注意的、經濟問題的中心問題、因為各個人出發點的不同、也許意見有異、但我們自由集會、是以服務國家為最大的努力、各人的思想純正、義氣相投、更是鄙人所深信、現在我們的國家這樣艱危、鄙人以為我國經濟現狀、所以成為問題、並非專由於國難當前、而實在由於經濟遠落人後的緣故、世界的進步、巳經到了想望很久的電氣時代、環顧我們的隣國、差不多都巳高度電氣化、他們的工程知化學的進步、也遠過我們所想象的、他們抱定武力主義、所以能做强國、似乎無可疑的、但武力主義、是反國際國家中義的產物、而國家主義、既是工業主義的原素、同時又是它的產物、何況工業主義，能使它國　的進步迅速又容易、返觀我國、不免使人發生「中國工業主義那裏一的疑問、我國大概可說還在工業幼稺時代、用煤的區域有限、礦油都是外國來的、而且其中只有極少部份、是用於生產的、照我們所知得的少數鐵礦、又差不多都是我們權力所達不到了，我們人民業農者、還是佔最大多數、而他們依然守着老法子、所產的數量、不夠供應全國人民生活的需要、至於要想改進我們的生活方洗、就是生產、或者輸入我們所需要的物品、可是現在我們所用、又大多數從外輸人來的、而且生產所需要的工具、也靠輸入、不但製造業要這樣的輸入了、就是農·林·礦·各業、又何書不是呢、在通商大埠裏、本也有新式工業、但是大多數都為外人所有和經營、我國運輸很不便利、就拿現在所有的來說、且勿間它的質量怎樣、僅問它的組織與數量、至少也要落後二十年、再至於勞工、這是我們常常自誇的、他們的勤苦·忍耐·忠勇、雖或不是他國人所及得、然而他們的體質亦差、說到智力、既然夠不上應用最新的科學管理、說到體力、也不能產生强壯有為的子女、我國可以耕種的田、不夠尋常的需要、而大規模的新式農礦製造各業、也少有充分的資本、這　經濟狀况、是怎樣的可悲可慮、但是我們天天在這裏面、仍然未得一個最好的辦法、同時也可以看到我們所遇得經濟問題、和我們鄰國所遇到的大不相同了、假使拿一句簡單而為世人所公認的話、來說明上面情形、那未、我們主要而迫切的經濟問題、就是生產問題、也就是從不足的社會經濟、而得到有餘的社會經濟、所以我們所必常明瞭而又急要解决的、就是什麼物品、什麼方法、什麼時候、什麼地方、用什麽資財、又用什麽人工、去替什麽人生產、我們要了解目前的嚴重時期、實在是考慮當前問題的必要條件、實際上我們的問題、是降代的産物、也是經過長期掙扎而達到的極點、升們應當省察過去的經驗、對於我們以前兩一代的負責人物的懶惰愚闇疏忽淺陋虛偽怯懦不忠實無效能、以及其他種種過失、更當細加檢點、來做個有效的改正和預防、我國的政治危機和經濟危機、那一個是因、那一個是果、以及當前國難和政治經濟的危機、那一個是因、那一個是果、雖然爭論很多、還沒有一致、但現在政治經濟的危機、實在是巳往的過失所釀成的、這是不能否認的、良好的政治和良好的經濟、實是相輔而行、不良好的政治、能夠牽涉經濟不良好的經濟、也能夠影響政治、我們現在所看見的、有很多能夠來證明、也不必細說了、所以鄙人的意思、我們在討論的時候、對於現在和過去經驗的指示、不能絲毫看輕的、反過來說、或者假使我們一面拿這邊的一個强國的眼光、一而又拿那邊的另一個强國的眼光、來觀察我們目己所有的問題、於是根據那一種的眼光、就建立一種解決的方案、那朱、不顧我們國家自己的情狀、離開我們民族本身的立塲、仿效苟或不當、危險更大、所以我們要有的確的見地和立論如何、應當知得他人的更要着重自己的經驗、能這樣、我們可知、孫中山先生的教訓之重要、中山先生所講的三民主義、就是融會貫通學問的結晶、的確有很多實際和理論的價值、這是我們在研究討論的時候、可引以為指導更有點、我們應知道、現在所有問題的正常解決、和一班人的心理態度、以及政策問題、都有深切的關係、在這一髮千鈞的時候、還有許多人抱着反動的心理、破壞的心理、低劣的心理、隱逸的心理、愚民的或盜賊的心理、和廿五年前革命發動的時候、正是一樣、所以現在的人、有些是思想行動帶着派別的色彩、把國家政府、當作他搶奪的東四、有些是只知道有一家或大的也不過一鄉、而不知有一國的、有些是不相信我們民族的個人或聯合起來能比歐洲人有更偉大更優良的成就的、有些是感覺到敵人的壓力、或我們自己責任的重大、而變作消極怯懦屈服和絕望的、更有些是守舊的、自以為謹慎、不肯接受任伺新思想和事物的、假使一國的人都是這樣、那末無論有怎樣實用和完善的國家經濟建設計劃、都不能成功、所以在研究和討論解決方法的時候、應當防備自己亦要注意旁人、不可被私人的勢力或偏見所征服、我們從過去二三十年、還有一個大缺點、就是不知道什麼人究竟能夠了解而且眞願意努力於我們民族所必要達到的目標、我們有時會問中國的將來究竟怎樣呢、或者中國人民究竟應領到什麼地方去呢、更且進一步而問中國究竟應當做資本主義或者做社會主義的國家呢、有時我們也承認孫總理的教訓、應常推行全國、但是遇到經濟政策成為個人或社會問題的時候、而有這樣考慮的、就很少了、我們的教育事業、家庭或其他的私人關係和背景、常常掛在我們的心中、不問有意或無意、我們對於當前的經濟問題、常常沒有一定的方針、假使有了、也是一人一省或一個區域的、而不是全國的、所以我們除非能夠明白目前的處境、又能夠了解將來的趨向、而共明定、更且共守一個國家的政策、然後國難或非常兩個字、才不致毫無意義、而僅僅變成一個空洞的名詞、我們在這裏所討論的、雖或不能盡是具體化、然與我國所應當採取的農礦工商運輸財政以及銀行等各種經濟政策、必有關係、這各種經濟的活動、和當前的難關、實在是糾纏不淸、所以我們討論、不能不照一定的步驟、各人的見解或有不同、又因為限於時間、不能議論透闢詳盡、但鄙人極望这次會議、能夠得到若干結論、至少可以引起更進一步的研究、</p>
<p>黨部致詞　市黨部代表何元明致詞云、各市、今天是貴社第十三年屆年會、貴社各位社員、都是我國的專家、工商鉅子、當代名流、這一次的會期、剛剛又逢在這國難嚴重、民生憔悴、國民經濟建設運動　極推進的時候、這不單是全中國人民希望貴社各位社員甚殷、就是我們政府也很希望貴社各位社員發抒鴻見、作成方案、輔助政府共抒難關、兄弟今天奉市黨部之命、代表前來、與貴社各位見面、得面聆各位的宏議碩見、榮幸萬分、興奮之至、兄弟是一個不學無術的人、要是呌兄弟對各位發表一點意見、實在覺　慚恚、但是為了自己職務起見、覺得又不能不勉强和各位說幾句話、現在我覺得國際情勢的演變、與中國關係的緊張、貴社應該注意、更應該提起全　精神研討的、就是弟一、中國目前是處在一個極危險極惡劣的環境當中、强鄰一天迫進一天、中國一日也危險一日、在這一個時期、我們倘沒有切實的辦法、應付這個危機、只有坐看中國被强鄰吞食、坐看中國人民被敵壓迫而已、應付這個危機的方策、固然很多、但是最有效的、莫過於非常時期的經濟與財政問題、希望各位對這問題、加以充分研討、製成具體方案、提供政府採擇施行、共抒國難、這是我希望貴社各位的第一點、第二、國民經濟建設運動、為中央實現民生主義的一種經濟政策實施綱領、早已製訂頒佈、總會及各地的分會、也都按决成立了、這一個運動無疑的是一個救濟全國人民生活疾苦的運動、同時也就是復興民族運動中的一種骨幹的運動、這一個運動的重要性、想各位都很明白、所以兄弟與海上各經濟專家、也發起組織一個經濟建設學會、以期以研究所得、供諸政府採納、我想貴社各位社員、都是經濟專家、並且都是躬身實踐的實行者、各地民生疾苦的情形、當然見聞得很淸楚很透澈、希望各位能本「先天下人憂而憂後天下人之樂而樂」的觀念、運用平時研究所得的學術、來輔助政府、來指導民衆、使國民經濟建設運動易於順利推行、迅速奏效、這是希望貴社各位的第二點、第三、我國因受數千年專制政治的遺毒、養成了「不再其位置「不謀其政」得惡習、一般人都認為國家的决策、單是從政者的職務、民間的輿論、覺得她亳　影響、這種風氣、民國以來、雖然已漸漸的改掉、但是像英美日本等國的政策決定、主要都是採用學者的建議、離開　種程度相差還遠、推究這個原因、一面固由於過去政府不大重視學術界的貢獻、但另一方面中國學者專好做空洞動聽的言論、對於切於實際、精密可行的意見、反不易見、這不能說我國學者不能不稍負一點責任、為了經濟改造了民族復興、希望貴社各位社員、决多多的注意於常前的實際問題、針對中國實況、策劃周詳、作成適中可行之對策、提供政府採擇、這是希望各位的第三點、兄弟的意見、就是這三點希望、錯誤的地方、還希貴社各社員加以不客氣的指正、並代表市黨部同人、謹祝貴社進步、各位健康、</p>
<p>孔部長詞　主席諸位來賓、諸位會員、今天兄弟參加中國經濟學社第十三屆年會、覺得非常欣慰、中國國民黨努力革命、其目的是在總理民生主義之實現、而目前我們國家民族所應該提價改良使他發展的、也就是在經濟、今天兄弟觀到中國經濟學社的論文題目、是非常的好、可惜兄弟以公務在身、不能多多參加年會、和各位討論、不過兄弟今天早晨、到貴院既和各位見面、當略有一點意思貢獻給大家、其題目是「中國經濟復興與經濟學社之使命」、我們中國生產落後、由來已久、在未與歐美通商以前、我們中國、可以說自給自足、但自與歐美通商以後、出口貨物、僅有價值低廉之原料雜糧、進口貨物、則多價值高昂之工業製品、故吾農民終年辛勤之收穫、僅能易得少許製造精巧之外貨、結果大貧小貧、遂成全國之普遍現象、此為數十年來之事實、母庸吾人諱言者也、不過衣食足、而後知榮辱、衣食不過、遑論政治、遑論教育、在此全國皆貧之狀態之下、唯有發展產業、復興經濟、國府成立以來、即漸從事於此、不幸吾國之產業基礎、尚未鞏固經濟建設、尚未完成、而此空前之世界經濟恐慌、則巳侵入、自通商大埠以至內地各省、莫不遭受恐慌之打擊、致輸出不振、引起農產市價之暴跌、農產價格之下落、醜成農村之破產、工商等業、又因輸出不振、農村破產而衰敗、處此空前之經濟恐慌局面之下、政府已難放任自然、坐待一般產業之自動復興、唯有外觀最近世界各國應付恐慌之方策、內察國內經濟金融之實際情形、採行斷然之處置、以期早日脫離恐慌之漩渦、解除人民之倒懸、樹立經濟復興之基礎、此即去年十一月法幣政壓之所以施行也、世界經濟恐慌暴發以來、各國之救濟政策、已與往昔不同、最初仍有若干國家、採用以前之對策、財政金融方而、實行緊縮、產業物價方面、則抱放任自然態度、此為自由主義派應付經濟恐慌之唯一方策，數十年來、世界各國、奉行不變、且多收效者也、而於此决恐慌則不盡然、實施之結果、恐慌程度、不特未見減輕、且反變本加厲、於是幡然改圖、乃以幣制改革為中心、採行積極之對策、對於貿易、則先壓低外匯、在適當標準之下、予以穩定、以期增進輸出、減少輸人、對於產業、則從物價與同業公會方面、實行統制、對於財政、一反昔日之緊縮政策、而增加支出、收支若有不敷、則發公債、吸收人民資本、以充國家經濟建設之用、而同時可以使人民得有利息、他方面可以增加人民之購買能力、對於金融、則採低利政策、以便產業之復興、公債之發行、對於物價、則因匯價壓低、已被相常提高、但又防止其騰貴過度、妨礙輸出貿易之發展、對於關稅、則仍沿用保護制度、以防進口貨物之增加、對於匯價、則在適當標準之下、予以穩定、或竟嚴加管理、實行統制、凡此種種、消極的簡在救濟恐慌、積極的則在復興經濟、際此國際經濟未能完全合作、國家經濟日益抬高之今日、而欲擺脫經濟恐慌之惡運、幷圖一國經濟之復興、則對於前述各種經濟政策、確有注意之價值、目自若干國家實施以來、着着收效、足證經濟上之自由主義、顯已發生勳搖、統制計劃經濟、則已漸占新時代之重要地位、吾國經濟環境、與歐美先進各國不同、產業發展程度、亦有先後之別、故吾國經濟復與政策、常然不能悉仿外國、亦步亦趨、例如去冬政府實施法幣政策、有若干點、固與英美日本等國類似、但其整個政策、以及施行目標與步驟、則有吾國特異之處、此即斟酌各國已收成效之對策、考察吾國所處之環境、對症下藥、始有此種根本改革、故如謂之完全脫胎於外國現行</p>

<p>之政策、則為事實所不許、若從舊式之自由主義立塲觀察、更難了解吾國以及世界各國現行經濟政策之眞義、總之、對內力求產業之自力更生、對外準備接受國際經濟之合作、而用國家力量、促進全國經濟之復興、故於近年來、蔣委員長一再提倡國民經濟建設、最近又於中央以及各省市縣設置國民經濟建設分會、要亦於不妨礙國際經濟協調之條件之下、以求本國經濟產業之自力更生、年來、鄙人受中央之付託、負全國財政之責、戰戰兢兢、力求人民負担之減輕、幷謀財政收支之平衡、幸賴各位經濟專家之襄贊、獲得一般民衆之諒解、際此世界經濟恐慌時代、各國財政皆有鉅額不敷之時、吾國財政收支尚能勉强應付、此則可堪吿慰者也、不過全國財務行政之使命、不僅力求收支平衡而已、允須運用適合國情之財政貨幣、金融政策、以達發展產業復興經濟解決民生之目的、最近法幣政策之實施、各種公債之整理、即其例也、不過新興事理之發展、常受舊學說之反對、新政策之推行、常受舊勢力之阻撓、此為世界各國通具之現象、不僅我國一國而已、故政府於新政推行之時、首須獲得一般民衆之諒解、否則誤會叢生、新政之効力不免減損矣、去冬、政府改革幣制之時、尚有少數人士、誤作膨脹通貨、聳動聽聞、即其例也、今則成續漸著、一般民衆、亦漸理解政府之苦心矣、再如新近舉辦之所得稅、本為各國最良之稅制、負扣公平、而又不妨害一般民衆之生計、故其實施、不僅增加國家稅收而七、且有預防貧富相差過鉅、實現經濟節制資本之至理在焉、譬如月賺三十元至六十元者、母十元課稅五分、此並不妨害他的生計、而於納稅人方面、、可使　養成良好納稅習慣、故兄弟很希望貴會同人、對於此種良好稅收、多多宣傳、使中國人民、有深切的暸解、然仍尚有少數人士、以為政府又行一種新稅、增加人民負担、此實不知最近世界各國之稅制、不明賦稅負担公平之原則者矣、是以經濟財政方面新政之推行、須先獲得一般民衆之諒解、方可事半而功倍、然在我國民衆教育尚未普及、人民之經濟智識、尚極幼稚、而欲使一般民衆、逐漸了解適合新時代之財政貨幣、金融政策、則尚有待在座各位經濟專家、於研究之餘、致力於經濟智識之普及、不過經濟學之範圍、殊為廣泛、允希諸位各就專長、從事經濟學識之普及化、實用化、藉收民衆與政府一致合作之效、則吾經濟復興前途、尚可事半而功倍、中國經濟　社、為我國歷史最久規模最大之經濟學術團體、際此全國力國經濟復興時期、理應負此使命、此即鄙人所切望者、中國目前的情形、非常危急、尤其是經濟衰落、產業洛後、在此情形之下、中國的前途、她非常危險但她兄弟以為上帝待我們中國很厚、以中國富源之多、人民之多、只要大家能平心靜氣、虛懷若谷、努力苦幹、快幹硬幹、則中國經濟的建設、必有成效的希望、而總理的民生主義、可以實現、總理的革命大業、亦可由此完成、此兄弟引相自勉、而願和貴會同人互相勉勵者也、</p>
<p>吳市長詞</p>
<p>吳市長致詞云、諸位先生、中國經濟學社、是我國久負時望的學術團體、各位社員、或為積學之士、或為各界領袖、此决年會、在上海舉行、實為本市增光、鐵城忝為地主、亦與有榮、惟猥承貴社社長函邀、要鐵城出席演講、實為班門弄斧之感、茲特乘此盛會、略貢拙見、尚希各位高明、加以匡正、我們曠觀人類的歷史、實充滿了人類求存生的事實、社會不斷的演進、人類不絕的求生、社會關係一天天的複雜、人類生存的要求、也跟着一天天的增多、從這種歷史演進的現象來說、經濟固不是社會生活的唯一要素、然却不能不說是一個有力的要　、而其影饗社會糾織政治制度的實際力量、則允為重大、從中國的歷史來說、古來民衆的首領、如有巢氏教民造屋、燧人氏鑽木取火、伏羲氏結網　、教漁佃、神農氏作耒耜、教耕稼、　帝作舟車、建宮室、嫘祖教民缫絲、凡此種種努力的意義、無非就在解決人民衣食住行種種實際的生存問題、滿足人民經濟生活的慾望、可見政治的意義、最初便是為了民生、　見國家最重大的事情、但是解决人民經濟生活的問題、有巢氏燧人氏神農氏以”黃帝、他們所以能受民衆的愛戴、成為民衆的首領、便是他們能夠認識、並完成政府的主要工作、能夠切實的解除當時人民經濟的苦痛、增進人民生活的幸福、從西洋的歷史來看、如政治史家海伊思氏說、歐州民主政治的實行、首由產業革命而發動、法國的政治史家薛業浦氏說、近代歐洲政治之所以能夠演進、完全由於經濟的發展、如物質的進步、人口的增加、交通的發達、都市的勃興、財富之增加、以及　本之發展、歐戰以後、各國政府、對於經濟的職務、更為重視、在新進的政治學家的著述中、以及各國新憲法的典章裏、關於國民經濟生活的問　、也佔了更重要的地位、於此可見政治的意養、自始便離不開經濟、拋開了民生的要求、便失去了政治的木意、為政的人、如果忘却了滿足民生要求而努力、便沒有了政治的　際、更不會有政治演進的可能、所以總理本其偉大的識力、時時昭吿黨人說、「民生是歷史的中心、不是為了民生、便不必革命」、並且建國大繼中、規定國家建設的步驟說、「建設之首要在民生」、應共謀農業之發展、以足民食、共謀織造之發展、以裕民衣、　造大計劃的各種房屋、以樂民居、修治道路運河、以利民行、蔣委員長深識我國根本的危機、在於全國國民經濟之破殘、故於去年八月九日、在成都通電全國、倡導國民經濟運動、這一個運動、非但是完成本黨革命建設的中心工作、尤其是救民建國的基礎運動、因為一個民族的生存發展、一定要有兩個條件，一是精神的、就是民族意識、一是物質的、就是健全的國民經濟基礎、從自己的歷史來看、越王勾踐要復興圖强、他所做的工作，也不外生緊教訓二點、後者即是精神的建設、前者即是物質的建設、從外國的歷史來　、近代歐洲各國的富强、固然是受了產業革命的影響、即如革命後的蘇俄、他的國力、所以能有異常的發展、也是全國上下致力經濟建設的結果、關於經濟建設的計劃、與方略如何這是一個專門問題、在如此短促的時間中、鐵城不欲率陳意見、不過從歷史的先例來看、任何國家經濟的建設與發展、必先有其理論的基礎、如十九世紀資本主義的發展、一定先有Aoams　Smith、（亞丹文）Johon　Stuart　Mill（穆勒）輩的經濟學說、學者的理論、初看似乎無關宏詣、如果深入了人心、得到了系統發展的機關、則非但會發生莫大的潛勢力、而其對於整個國民經濟生活的實際影響、　竟為利為害、為禍為福、實允為重人、中國革命既與各國革命的主義與環境、都有不同、同時中國現在正當革命建設的途程中、彷彿一張白紙、染蒼則蒼、染黃則黃、究竟將來成為什麽形樣的一種國家、實為今日學者的理論思想有莫大的關係、現在國人思想、猶甚紛歧、貴社於吾國學術界有極大的　威、用特提出這一個國家建設的基本問題、希望能在此决盛會中、得到許多可寳貴的教益、　祝諸君康健、謹祝大會成功、</p>

<h3>東華會旗開得勝　九比二大敗聖芳濟　戴麟經獨中五球李許薛各建功績　上半時四比一小勝下半時五對一</h3>
<p>東華足球會昨與新近晋組甲組之聖芳濟隊、在市體育塲作西聯足球甲組賽、觀衆僅寥寥六七百人、殊出人意料之外、交鋒後、聖芳濟銳氣極盛、東華反被挾制、嗣卽一蹶不振、東華陳容齊整、結果東華以九對二大勝、上半時四比一、裁判那愛說、雙方陳容如後、</p>

<p>先失一球</p>
<p>笛聲起後、聖芳濟先攻、福恩進展、阻於尚勷、麟經盤球進取、遭拒退回、文繡立踢角球、義臣略慢一步、失去極佳機會、未幾、東華全師猛撲、李寗亦衝出前綫助攻、戴麟經舉足叩門中的、惜以越位作廢、義臣亦於二十碼建射門被接、對方乘東華後防又極空區、喬納洛單槍直入、莊維新拚命追趕、送成角球、東華旣出險境、遂又獲角球機會、義臣頭攻被接、福恩引球前進、遞交麥克卡倫、李寗迎拒、不愼失脚、球滾滾在東華門前、惠萊趕上、一脚搾柱而入、東華先失一城、距開賽尚祗八分鐘、</p>
<p>連中四元</p>
<p>十五分鐘時、東華大軍環攻、許文奎首先射中、一比一打成平手、幾度回合、許文奎斬關直入、遙遞義臣、猛射、低而且急、中蘇石身、彈入網內、（二比一）、至此、東華球勢更甚、尤以萬象華為最、良機亦接踵而至、象華送中內門前、麟經主射、又告中的、（三比一）東華防地遇險、惠萊急進、莊失足、喬納洛速射、榮才趕出、被惠萊猛撞仆地、幸身手靈活、躍起仍救出險境、尚勷得球、轉送前綫、文奎略一盤旋、舉足急射命中、（四比一）聖芳濟一度反攻、麥克卡倫射門未逞、檸檬時到、東華以四比一佔先、</p>
<p>所向披靡</p>
<p>再戰開始、東華反處於逆風地位、聖芳濟乘勢進逼、喬納洛福恩相繼射門、張榮才一一救出、此後東華包圍敵門、彈如雨發、均未如願、八分鐘時、聖芳濟被罰十二碼、義臣主踢、切橫木而入、（五比一）此後聖芳濟又漸活躍、屢次反攻、泊脫遜於百忙中偷渡陳倉、榮才未曾注意、幸球竟沿柱斜出、</p>
<p>成九比一</p>
<p>東華雖控制全局、但以勝算已操、未免大意、致門下機會、又壘次錯過、一刻鐘時、文繡送交麟經、戴騰空飛去、又中橫木彈入網內、（六比一）未幾再加一球、成七比一、東華球運亨通良機相逼而來、　分鐘後、球又轉入文奎脚頭、遠遞門前、麟經低射成八比一、此球之入、當以文繡厥功最偉、一轉瞬間、文繡又單騎直入、不及傳遞、一踢而入、淸晰之至、（九比一）此時雙方將卒、均感疲勞、</p>
<p>大意失地</p>
<p>福恩往昔為聖芳濟柱石、昨竟極不景氣、一再失機、更心灰意懶、東華目睹敵軍怠逸、更以勝負已判、未免過於大意、詎聖芳濟忽以全軍猛撲、泊脫兩度猛攻、惠萊又斜裏穿出、挑送右方、麥克卡倫趁勢　射、居然成功、未幾、銀笛聲起、東華遂以九比二大獲全勝、</p>

<p>經濟專刊五十年如一日的中國工業  柳塘　　提起中國貿易的不利及中國經濟落後的原因·不覺回想到五十年前，中國已在吹大法螺，擊大法鼓，用興業富强作號召。其時所有的主張建議，與今日吾人之主張建議，除因時代自然的演變之外，竟可說大同小異，甚至有許多至今還沒有做到。我國人的辦事精神，如此濡緩，不目振作，可謂舉世罕有其倫。　　所以光緒甲午中日之役，（距今四十三年）中國强大之海軍，不經日本「船小器利」海軍之一擊，及師敗求和，日本定要「位望甚尊，聲名素著給與十足責任」之「和事老」（因當時與外人講和，都是他出任）李鴻章去講和，及李到了馬關，日本全權伊籐博文老實不客氣對李說：　　「別來十年，中國毫未改變成法，以至於此，同為抱歉。」　　最好不過的「同為抱歉」，是何等幽默呀！　　中國興業，旣有五十年的歷史（至少限度），何以至今依然故吾，仍沒有建立工業的基礎，甚而受害日深，形勢日非，大有民族工業永無抬頭之希望。此固然由於外來的經濟侵略，及馬關條約許外人在我國通商口岸設立工廠，為之厲階；但是，卽無外患，中國工業亦恐難得健全的發展。這或須此言為人所不滿，但如能健全發展，事實决不至如今日一樣。　　「前事不忘，事後之師。」有今日之果，安知非為昔日所種之因。因之我不談現在，而談過去；尤其所談為過去之過去，不在民國，而在淸朝。。蓋有今日之工商業，其發　當在五十年以前也。　　五十年以前，何以感覺到要興業；說來話長；簡括言之，也是受到歐風美雨的敲盪，兵敗求和的刺激，方思發憤圖强，起而效鞶。故自同治年間平定太平軍後，至光緒初年，為興業第一期。因平定太平軍得力於外國人敎練之洋槍隊，並震驚於槍砲之銳利，機器之靈便，故曾左李諸人皆重視，機器局造船廠之興辦，如江南及馬尾之船政局，上海及著名大省會之機器局，而當時所謂機器局實卽製械局。船政局所造者大都為小輪船，（當時稱為「偷鷄包」，大約為Steam　Boat之轉音）至機器局所造之槍砲，不但材料需外求；卽出品亦皆陳舊，以之應付弓箭刀槍之土匪尚有餘，抵抗外來之巨艦大砲則不足，故每當外戰發生，臨時向海外訂購軍械，添置船隻。中法戰役如是，中日戰役亦如是。一種平時無準備臨時無所措之慌張神情，我們從後看到前去，眞正哭笑不得（不知後之視今，是否亦然。）然而左宗棠平西，說是得力於槍砲。不過他的槍砲，乃是向德國買來，並非本國機器局所自製。且其　所用的槍砲，後膛居少數，大多數還是用銅帽子引火的前膛槍，小鋼砲，那末何能與日新月異的外國軍隊抵抗。惟此可說是中國兵工業發動時期。　　胡林翼看見火輪船行駛如飛，以為外國軍隊不難乘之而來中國，心中一急，居然昏倒，或許是後人傳述過甚的話，但是閩滬開辦船政局，正為的要製造輪船，而輪船招商局之開辦，亦為貫澈此主張。招商局於同治十一年由李鴻章奏請設立，「商為承辦，官為維持，」故謂之招商局。（但其時凡招商承辦者，俱稱招商局，如雲南之銅，光緒初年歸商辦，亦稱招商局所以加「輪船」等詞以別之，）又鑒於中俄收回伊犁交涉，曾紀澤自俄京來一電報，朝發而夕至。而自上海至北京二千數百里，一封　書，由驛遞必以十日為期，由輪船亦須六七日，因之感覺電報之重要，光緒五年，遂開始敷設天津至上海之電報綫。郵政雖未明定制度，亦已在推行中。此為交通事業發動之時期。然而對於交通最利便之鐵路，還以為「不適用於中國」而排斥之。光緒　年九月出了廿八萬五千兩之代價，買斷英人所造之淞滬鐵路拆毀之。直至後來（光緒十三年）經過中法一役，深感關內外調兵不便，乃思利用開平曠務局運煤鐵路，展長至大沽及山海關間，以供接應海陸運兵之用。再至光緒二十一年，張之洞有蘆漢鐵路之建議（卽今之平漢路），遂與王文韶會保津海關道盛宣懷以四品京堂候補，督辦鐵路總公司。鐵路已在開始建築了，洋債亦陸續商借成立了。疆吏　顧以鐵路抵借外債，供一時的揮霍，圖回佣的豐富，而不念外力深人內地，種日後外交上不少的糾紛，增加後人甚重的担負。一念之貪，貽患無窮，不知當時袞袞諸公亦曾考慮及此否？　　光緒初年，洋貨已如潮般輸入。元二兩年貿易尚為出超。及後，貿易額逐年擴張，人超數亦頻年膨脹，頗引起時人之注意。其時對外貿易占出口大宗者為絲茶，故各省督撫皆以提倡蠶桑為急務，如左宗棠之在新甘創辦蠶織局，江西之創辦蠶桑學堂，以及山西，湖北，廣西諸省，無一不以興辦蠶桑為事，號稱賢明。茶則已受印日茶之影響，頗多人建議改革，其所擬辦法，正興近人所主張者，幾同一轍。左宗棠在蘭州費百餘萬金，思利用就地之羊毛，開辦織呢局，亦為的想抵制洋貨。進口貨中，以洋藥（雅片）為大宗，故多主張，增收洋藥稅，但是英使威妥瑪故意反對，至曾紀澤使英，始告解决。此外為布疋昵絨，進口亦多，故湖北江蘇等處，多欲辦紡織廠。及甲午中日之役，旣割臺灣澎湖諸島，又賠欵二萬萬兩，另加贖回遼東半島三千萬兩，還要担任日軍駐在威海衛兵費，淸廷上下，旣感應付困難，又覺刺激太强，負担太重，不得已借洋債付賠欵，第一次英德借欵，合庫平銀一萬萬兩，付日本賠欵及威海衛兵費已去了七千七百萬兩，不得已而向之續借，此外又向法俄借欵，故至光緒二十一年，每年應償之洋欵本息，已在一千五六百萬。於是淸廷，最所躊躇者如何得到一筆巨金以備償付賠欵外債之用，那末，最好莫如開闢金銀曠，有了金銀，還怕甚麼！適王鵬運請鑄銀圓，並及開曠，乃　詎謂：　　「開辦曠務，以金銀曠務為先，各省如能實力訪查確有金銀曠地，設法興辦，自較煤曠等項得欵為鉅。」　　外省乃爭陳開曠，漢河金曠，熱河銀曠，為當時最注目之曠。　　自為日本所敗，所受之損失，比以前任何一次對外戰事為大，乃知非自强不足以救亡。所謂自强者，卽從整練軍隊入手，以禦外侮。兩江總督張之洞創編自强軍，用洋敎習，教練洋操，卽是此意。但其後亦知欲圖自强，祗仗軍隊還是不够，必富而後能强，於是朝野上下，又侈談富强。其時所謂富强之策，可用光緒二十一年閏五月二十五日諭旨作證：　　「目今國事艱難，惟有蠲除積習，力行實政為先。……如修鐵路，鑄鈔票，造機器，開各曠，折南漕，减兵額，創郵政，練陸軍，整海軍，立學堂，大約以籌餉練兵為急務，以恤商惠工為本源，俱應及時舉辦。……」　　張之洞又廣調洋務人員如龔照瑗（前駐英使）許景澄（駐俄德使）等在江南創辦銀元·鐵政·織布·紡紗·繅絲·各局，皆仿西法製造。一方面對仿造機製洋式貨物出口，止完出口正稅，免除沿途稅厘。此為中國新工業之發動，相沿以迄於今，前後已在五十餘年。　　當時如曾國藩左宗棠李鴻章曾國荃沈葆楨劉坤一，皆方面大員，一時人傑。左宗棠之開發新甘實業，及其一切規畫，假如繼起有人，豈止留幾顆「左公柳」供後人之憑弔紀念，西北或許早成為富庶之區，所惜我國人到如今還是「人存政舉，人亡政息」，中國新工業之不得進步，這亦是大原因之一。李鴻章所創辦的事業最多，也是地位使然，因為自從地代曾國藩為北洋大臣之後，中間雖略有間斷，可說自同治末年直至光緒二十年，他總是直隸總督，北洋大臣。不但說是海軍，所有機器製造輪船電報，都是他主持的。實際上則為他手下兩個紅道員，一是周馥，一是盛宣懷，周盛俱先後為津海關道，尤其是盛宣懷，所有新辦的交通事業，可說皆在他一人掌握之中。盛宣懷不但是他鴻章手下惟一紅人，卽如劉坤一王文韶張之洞凡當南北洋大臣的，無一不保舉他，不重用他，他還開辦南北洋大學，學辦中國第一家之中　通商銀行，經手各地方鐵路借欵，後來為倍儭赫德賞了宮保銜，名利雙收，最倖運是沒有的了。可是對於新事業最努力的仍要推張之洞。張之洞升遷最快，由內閣學士　放而為山西巡撫，卽轉任為兩廣總督，湖廣總督，兩江總督，再回到湖廣總督，但看這幾個官銜，已知他一帆風順。袁世凱還是他後進，據說：他心目中所忌畏的是張之洞，後來不知何故，也給他看破了，因之予智自雄，不可一世，這是另話，姑且不提。張之洞與李鴻章所辦的不同，他是鑄造銀園的開國功臣，所注重的是在繅絲紡織，諸廠，以及改良蠶桑，興修鐵路，江蘇湖北到今朝所有的實業，大都還是他來推動或者是創辦的。自從有這幾人提倡於前，自有人追隨於後，所以當時最流行的論調為富强，與目前談經濟復興是同樣的時髦。　　官辦的事業究竟能有如何的成績，就當時各種文字觀之，不堪回首。此處摘錄一二小節，以見一斑：　　光緒五年王先謙條陳洋務奏中有云：　　「從來營利之舉，官辦必難持久，船政總理大員，屢行更換，經管多人，頭緒紛雜，照察不及，久則弊生，　帑項有限，擴充為難。……」　　光緒十二年戶部議復李鴻章請加招商局運漕水脚案中有云：　　「招商局十餘年來，不特本息不增，而官欵洋債，欠負纍纍，豈謀之不臧哉！稽之案牘，證之人言，所謂利權，上不在國，下不在商，盡歸於中飽之員紳，如唐廷樞朱其昂之被參於前，徐潤張鴻祿之敗露於後，主計之不得其人，出入之經費不能講求撙　，又安得以局本虧折，　之於海上用兵耶？」　　海上用兵，指的是中法越南戰事。其時所謂官辦事業，寬有將製造局言本，報捐道銜，見諸彈章，侵占自肥，不在少數。所以凡經　此項事業者，無一不橫發其財，掙得產業千百萬，一身享用難盡，而遺諸子孫者比比。時人亦有鑒及此，主張由官辦而改為商辦。茲摘錄褚成傳奏中語以槪其餘。內云：　　「中國製造機器等局不下八九處，歷年耗費不貲，一旦用兵，仍須向外洋採辦軍火，平日工作不勤，所製不精，已可槪見。福建船廠，歲費銀六十萬，鐵甲兵艦仍未能自造。湖北槍砲煉鐵各局，經營數載，糜費已多，如能仿照西例，改歸商辦，弊少利多。……」　　六十萬兩銀子，在目前看去，似乎不算一回事，但照當時情形以及各種物價比較，六十萬兩非同小可。　　官辦不如商辦，旣成為事實，那末自官辦移轉商辦，究竟是怎麼一回事。且將褚成博所舉之「糜費已多」之湖北煉鐵廠作一例子。　　湖北煉鐵廠卽漢陽鐵廠，開辦時候很費了一筆大本錢，且把他列表於後：（單位為銀兩）　　部撥欵　二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇　　鹽糧道庫銀　四〇〇，〇〇〇　　鹽釐銀　三〇〇，〇〇〇　　撥用槍砲經費　一，五六四，六二二　　新海防捐尾數　二八，五五一　　撥用織布局股本　二七八，七六二　　鐵廠自煉鋼鐵價銀　二四，八二五　　借撥江南籌防局　五〇〇，〇〇〇　　爾淮商捐　五〇〇，〇〇〇　　共收　五，五八六，四一五　　實用　五，六八七，六一四　　不敷　一〇一，一九九　　及歸商辦，官欵衹允將來歸還，承辦之人嘗引此自翎，以為較之「各省船政製造各局所用經費從未收回」者，非可同語。可見當時官辦事業，本錢常常蝕完，或為商人席捲以去。　　所謂移歸商辦之商人，不是搖身一變之官僚，卽紅頂花翎之鉅商，蓋當時與官塲往來之商人，大都為「二品銜補道，」非如此，不能沆韰一氣。但以巴結官塲之商人，辦理實業，其成效如何，可用事實去證明。　　官辦事業之不易見效，就是為辦理之人用力不專，時受到政局的影響，朝令暮改，五日京兆，鑽營奔走，逢迎獻媚，又是千古不易之常理。豈肯自己掏腰包來報效，結果是「羊毛出在羊身上，」拿公家的錢，做他的應酬，或者移作他私人經營的資本，如此事業那會見好。　　假使商辦能有效，中國工商業亦不會五十年如一日，糟到如此地步。總之，自私自利心太重的，不能營團體生活，亦不能與談科學，亦不能與談工業。所以中國工業比之五十年前，言其量，自然增加，言其質，進步的絕為有限　　篇幅不容許再多說。我深願有機會——如果市上尚沒有此書的話，就淸代的貨幣貿易興業各事件寫一本小册子，供讀者消遣。假使已有此項著作，或已出版或在編著中，希望閱者舉以見告，免我再去做這番工作。因為我自覺所見到的書有限，果眞是沒有的話，那末，我不妨權充一下「廖化」。論最近的對外貿易  予敻　　自從幣制改革之後，中國對外貿易的趨向，有顯着的改善，這是大家公認的事實。因此一般人發表議論，多偏樂觀，對於新幣制與貿易的關係，不無估量過於其値，吾人私憂竊計，並非故作冷淡態度，但亦不能忽略了眞實。蓋中國國際貿易，為若干種基本的勢力所支配，貨幣現象，不過此若干種勢力中的一種，改革幣制，不過减去了若干種病害中的一種。今後如何改進國內生產構造，以謀出入口貿易之切實的好轉，猶有待於努力也。吾人要明白最近國際貿易的實際趨向，要知道事實上已經好轉到什麼程度，則似不能只以出入口的總價値為憑，而應加以進一步的分析，茲簡為一述。國人其稍注意。　　單就國幣計算的貿易總値論，則本年一月至七月與去年同時期貿易情形的比較如下：　　二十五年　一十四年　　一月至七月　一月至七月　　（國幣計算）　　進口　五三二、九一五、三三〇　六〇九、八三一、六七一　　出口　三九三、一六二、七〇五　三〇五、三二八、六〇〇　　入超　一四〇、七五二、六二五　三〇　、五　三、〇七一　　就這些數目的比較看，本年一月至七月與去年同期的人口較，約减七千六百萬元，出口約增九千萬元，因此入超約减少一萬五千元。這自然是一個極可樂觀的現象。但我人認為這種觀察，似嫌偏於表面現象。因為吾人知道自去年改革幣制時始中國的滙價於一日夜貶低了百分之四十，以國幣計算的出入價値，自然增加，因為中國的對外貿易，是和滙價直接發生關係的。係如我們的貨幣價値能推回到與去年同一基礎之上，然後觀察其比較的情形，當能更為正確的顯示貿易的趨向，因為我們由此可以避開滙價對於貿易價値的影響。並且貿易情形與中國國際收支的關係，實際仍以金單位為計算準繩，國幣數量，並非國際支付的單位。所以吾人認為要切實一點的理解中國貿易的情形，則應以金單位的計算為基礎，避開幣價變動的影響然後才能加以比較。假如改以金單位計算，那嗎今年一月至七月與去年同時期貿易情形的比較如下：　　二十五年　二十四年　　一月至七月　一月至七月　　進口　一三六、七四三、二八一　三四七、六　五、九八一　　出口　一七三、〇五五、〇〇〇　一七四、七一〇、〇〇〇　　入超　三三、六八八、二八一　七二、八九五、九八一　　就上表的情形看與以國幣計算的情形完全不同。入口方面，約减少三分之一，出口方面，則保持不變，並不見得比去年多，至於入超，確比去年减少甚多。以關金計算，吾人認為是比較準確的。這就是說假如我們剔除幣價的變動，使貨幣價値的尺度與去年同等大小，那嗎第一個事實就是說出口並沒有增加，一般人所謂增加的是受幣價變動的幻覺的影響。第二個現象就是入口减少的迅速，與去年較幾减三分之一。因此入超的减少不是由於出口的增加，而完全是由於入口的减少，這趨向是很明顯的。出口不增而單純的入口减少，這對於一個產業落後的國家有些什麼意義，是很可研究的。倡國際均衡說者以為滙率穩定之後國際資本可以流入，中國可以利用國外的機器工具從事於經濟建設，但有形入口的頓减，似乎所證明的恰好相反，這是很値得注意的。吾人認為我國經濟地位的改善，有待於國外資本和工具的借助，平衡國際收支，最有利的要從增加出口方面設想，假如只以减少入口平衡收支，這局面不是完全有利的。這是第一點。其次，貿易的總數只是告訴吾人一個大勢，要明瞭貿易的本質，吾人還要再進而分析各　輸出入商品的個別的趨向，因為同是商品，而其利與弊則往往完全不同。特別是在我們現在更應該注意質的變化。　　先從從輸入方面看，吾人依照海關分類分組的方法，將各組的數目抄出，然後逐一與去年比較，發覺了一些非常不可樂觀的現象。這就是入口的减少，似乎是很不自然的。入口减少之最顯著的，第一就是布，棉貨，和人造絲，第二，就是雜糧及糧粉，第三就是糖，第四就是煤油，而出現一個相反的事實就是化裝口首飾香粉等消耗品的入口，反有增加。這種局面，是很値得詳細的加以注意的。現在將本年一月至七月上述各類的出入口情形列為一表如下，以便參考。　　二十四年　二十五年　　金單位　國幣　金單位　國幣　　棉布及人造絲　四四、三六、三一一　七七、七　四、七三一　　八、四九四、　五〇　六四、　九一、八　四　　雜糧等　六　、〇四六、　六　　一二〇、五　六、〇一七　一八、六四七、　〇五　四　、九九九、九七一　　糖　一一、一七九、六　八　一九、六〇　、七〇二　三、七三八、五一〇　八、四四一、四九〇　　煤油　一三、三七六、一八八　二　、九一六、　五三　七、六八八、二七〇　一七、　五、〇三〇　　化裝品　　四、八八八、六七〇　四三、　一九、四七九　三〇、二〇〇、三一二　六八、一一六、二　四　　上列各項可分類解釋。棉布料人造絲糖煤油等進口的减少，原因是很顯明的，這就是由於公開的走私，其非受國幣政策施行後匯價變動的影響，明如觀火。只能說是海關記錄的不能包括入口，並不能說輸入已經减少。至於糧食輸入的减少，原因就是國內的豐收，這也是偶然的現象，並不能視為經常的貿易的好轉。再化裝品的輸入，是絕對不必要的，却反而大增特增，這就是說中國人以中國人民更多的血汗，換成無聊享樂的物品，這種輸入的增加，就是表明中國人的不要臉，不爭氣，是絕對的害處的。再看機器及工具一項的輸入，為國內經濟建設所必需，二十四年一月至七月為一九，六五四，九〇七金單位，二十五年同期則减為一五，〇三九，一　〇金單位。這事實表明中國人有了錢不去換謀生存的工具，却換成醇酒婦人享樂消愁的裝飾品，這還不是　種够危險的象徵嗎？「傷心不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花」以及今日娛樂不忘救國，高明能有機何。所以從輸入的主要物品的分析，减少的部分是由於走私，是由於國內偶然的農產豐收，增加的部分是由享樂主義的加速發展。貿易好轉的曙光在那裏呢？我們還是找不到的。願國人多檢討一點事實。　　就輸出的各類物品看，以國幣計算可說是一般的增加的，但假如改用金單位比較，情形亦就有些不同了，若干類的物品反而比去年同時期减少，最顯著的就是藥材雜糧，子仁，茶，紡織品等。這些物品，多數出自農民，若干人以　幣制改革之後，農產原料等出口可以增加，農民收入可以相對增多，農村經濟可以轉向有利，但截至現在止，事實所證明的似乎和這種說法相反，我們可以看如下的例證。（自　月至七月，用金單位計）　　二十四年出口　二十五年出口　　雜糧　六、八一五、一一四　四、九九〇、七四四　　子仁　一六、六七二、一二三　一〇、七一六、一〇一　　茶　八、八一八、〇五一　五、九五五、七八九　　紡織品　二、七三七、　四八　一、九三五、五六七　　藥材香料　二、八七　、二〇三　二、三五六、四　二　　至於出口增加的部分，第一就是皮貨，第二是染料，第三是燃料，第四是絲織品。這些物品輸出的增加，原亦不是中國的自身之力，似乎亦不是匯價低落之賜，而是國際經濟好轉的關係，這只要看各類物品的性質，便可知道的。（金單位）　　一月至七日　　二十四年　二十五年同期　　皮貨　九、三三四、一一九　一三、六二七、二一五　　染料　九、〇五三、六　〇　二七、三六〇、五二四　　燃料　二、八二八、七六四　三、二六三、八七〇　　絲及織維　一二、〇五二、九八六　一〇、九八六、五三　　　這些物品輸出的增加，吾人認為主要的還是靠着國際經濟好轉之賜，中國本身似乎無重大的關係。至於其他各類物品，事實上都無多大的增减。所以就入口方面的情形看，卽使認為已經好轉，但其好轉的程度亦只能認為好轉到不比去年　，此外再找不到什麼傍的東西。　　如上面所說，吾人似乎不必再存什麼樂觀。中國對外貿易的好轉，似尚有待於國內生產構造之基本的改進，只憑貶低匯價，是無能為力的，我們不要過價而估，為表面現象所惑。如何改進國內的生產機構呢，道路决不在把金錢換成裝飾品，而在於促進基本的工業化建設。假如冉如過去數月的事實所顯示，吾人認為不但不能樂觀，且是很危險的。商業新聞證券　時局不安　公債市塲亦起變化　　上週（九月二十一日至二十六日）華商證券交易所、市况升降、極為活躍、數星期來沉悶狀况、完全為日人被害事件之接蹱而起、掃盡無餘、幷有由活動而趨於緊張情形、目以九月份期貨、已屆最後之數日、又引起軋多風潮、大戶賣出、多頭出籠、一時風起雲湧、環境情形、日趨嚴重、波濤之來、當尚在後、市上幷有十月一日增拍復興公債期貨買賣之傳說、尤使人心虛軟、觀於數日業金融界賣出統一公債、數量甚鉅、或係為籌備現金、備收復興公債之需要、目下丙丁戊三種、均已打破六十元大關、前途尚難樂觀、上週經過、週一發生漢口事件、空氣頗形惡劣、市上因掉期關係，尚漲起二三角左右，週二有日提嚴重條件之謠、賣氣頗盛、全日下降、小四角至八角、週三市氣平衡、多空互有掉期、市况漲跌互見二三角、週四為九月份期貨最後一天、虹口事件、亦突於是日發生、一時疑雲密佈、謠　紛紜、市况乃起劇變、跌數一角至一元五角、週五祇做十月份期貨一個月、市價雖疲、尚屬安定、略小二三角、週六變動、旣速而鉅、且增拍十一月份期貨、上午因華界安定而回漲、下午謠言大盛、捕風捉影、各帮賣出、以金帮及紗花帮為多、某大機關、亦有大量賣出、市價跌風大起、十一月新做開、一日市價高低、有兩元之鉅、十月份結果、亦小七八角、前途以危險成份愈多、未可樂觀、一週市價結果、十一月份新做開不計外、九月份計跌一元餘至二元餘、十月份計跌數角至一元半、成交總數、共計六千四百六十九萬、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）本週一為九月份期貨交割停市一天、　　債別　最高價星期　最低價星期　較上週　成交數　　統戊九月　六〇·八五　一　五八·四〇　四　跌一·九〇　三三、〇五〇　　統戊十月　六〇·八五　一　五八·九五　六　又一·六五　八〇、　五〇　　統戊十一月　五九·九五　六　五八·三〇　六　新開出　二一、五〇〇　　統丁九月　六二·一〇　一　六〇·九〇　四　跌〇·七五　一四、四〇〇　　統丁十月　六二·一〇　一　五九·〇〇　六　又二·二〇　五二、五五〇　　統丁十一月　六〇·八五　一　五九·〇〇　六　新開出　九、五五〇　　統丙九月　六一·八〇　一　五九·四〇　四　跌一·九〇　四一·〇〇〇　　統丙十月　六一·六五　一　五九·〇〇　六　又二·三五　八二、二〇〇　　統丙十一月　六〇·四〇　六　五八·九五　六　新開出　二二、六五〇　　統乙九月　六五·三五　一　六二·七〇　四　跌二·一〇　二四、〇五〇　　統乙十月　六五·一五　一　六二·三五　六　又二·五〇　一七、三五〇　　統乙十一月　六三·五五　六二·一五　六　新開出　一三、五〇〇　　統甲九月　六九·〇〇　一　六七·五〇　四　跌一·　五　一六、五五〇　　統甲十月　六九·〇〇　一　六六·八〇　六　又一·四五　六〇、五〇〇　　統甲十一月　六七·七〇　一　六六·六五　六　新開出　一〇、七〇〇　　金長九月　五五·七〇　一　五三·五〇　一　漲〇·三〇　一、二五〇　　九六九月　二〇·一〇　一　九·二五　四　跌〇·六〇　二　、三〇〇　　九六十月　一〇·一〇　一　九·三〇　六　又　·六五　三九、二五〇　　九六十一月　一〇·一五　一　九·　五　四　新開出　四、四　〇　　　內現　六一·五〇　三　久未開　一〇糧食　靑浦新窰種上市　　價開九元七…百哥到多跌半元　　（滬南）昨日各帮來源與前相仿、共到有三十七八號、貨共七千四五百石、內中仍以新貨居多、故如百哥稻來源旣湧、銷又呆滯、包胃僅辦數十包、迺價竟暴跌半元之譜、而厚新粳遂亦帶下一二角、靑浦窰種業已上市、貨品尚佳、價開九元七角、新杜洋等尖、供求依然相仿、市無榮辱、至於破礱、厚者貨稀定局、薄則雖包胃仍有靑島大連等帮辦五六百包、而以處境已衰、故價再降角許、陳變元乏貨帶緊、新陰元無所軒輊、　　常帮白粳一〇·七　同里新粳九·二〇　黎里蘆尖八·一五　　又高白粳一一·〇　又新蘆尖八·二五　又白粳九·五五　　又市白粳一〇·五　又新羊尖七·九〇　橫扇蘆尖八·一〇　　又次白粳　〇·〇　又河灘尖八·〇〇　新埭白哥八·八〇　　又白粳一一·〇　蘇州新粳九·三五　又蘆尖八·一五　　泗涇特包一〇·五　北　蘆尖八·二五　呂巷北粳九·八〇　　松江破包一〇·三　又新蘆尖八·二〇　又新蘆尖八·一五　　又另特一〇·五　又新羊尖七·八五　松隱早破九·七五　　又特別一〇·四　又新陰千元九·八〇　洙涇白哥八·九〇　　又冲特一〇·〇　車坊新粳九·一五　又白稻九·〇〇　　黃橋特包一〇·四　吳江羊尖七·九五　靑浦窰種九·七〇　　又另特一〇·六　又新羊尖七·八五　又新羊尖八·〇五　　航船特別一〇·八　又新蘆尖八·四〇　角里薄破　·八〇　　又冲特一〇·五　盛澤羊尖七·五七　又薄破九·七〇　　又大市一〇·〇　平望羊尖七·七五　又香粳九·三〇　　又中關九·八　陳墓新粳九·四五　又紅稻九·四五　　松江大市九·八　黎里羊尖七·七〇　又特紅粳九·七〇　　五厙薄破九·七　又新羊尖七·六〇　楓涇白哥九·〇〇　　（滬北）昨日河下各地來源四十三四號、市上破粳去貨平淡、價小角外、新粳零銷尚可、市價亦疲一二角、羊杜埠尖零胃續化、價形定勢、東瓣粳價小一角、客尖及其餘各

<p>康健之路  康健醫藥社主編「快樂地獄」的罪惡交織成淋病白帶的陷穽  法國巴黎花柳病學者勃朗秀各氏著　日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳宗堃醫師譯　　……十九世紀德國哲學家叔本華因性病的苦痛而倡厭世主義　……由廣大人羣的熱烈要求卒有德國最新有效療法之大成功　　十九世紀德國名哲學家叔本華（schopenhawer），他主唱厭世主義；又把女性攻擊得體無完膚。他一生没有娶過妻子。據伊橫撲落黑說，他的這種思想的發生。和性病有重大關係。原來他曾玩過女人，當時他所吟「快樂地獄」（O．Wohlluoe，O　Holle）的詩就是對這方面的表示。　　許多人都為他染患梅濁而惋惜着。然而人們禁不住青春的興奮，仍是不斷地往所謂「快樂地獄」裏走。那裏面交織着淋病梅毒的網，「一失足成千古恨」，又因為歐洲男女之防，素來弛緩，輾轉傳播，所以男女患淋濁的很多。　　一八九三年，E．Frankel氏提倡用蛋白體治療淋病，一時醫界詫為空前發見！同時，各國政府鑒於生淋病的人日多，於是下令醫藥界通力合作，再加研究。後來德國彼得（Biedel）博士發明把蛋白體混和黄色素制成「克淋儂」一藥。淋病治法，這才有着確切的把握。因黄色素和蛋白體兩者缺一不可。關於此點，Bertin博士在德國醫學雜誌上已經論道它。我（譯者按：此係著者自稱。余在日本帝國醫科大學時已雷聞其名）曾迭次用此藥治愈許多急慢性的淋病男女患者，男子尿道淋（每百人中有九十七名治愈，睾丸攝護腺炎及關節炎服半打至八九瓶即可治愈女子白帶除服「克淋儂」外，兼外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥，百人中有九十八名治愈。可見最新名藥「克淋儂」治淋的效騐，已成鐵一般的事實！女子的早衰與經閉  陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師　　被丈夫的輕視，遺棄一切痛苦之深淵。　　大概女子較男子發育為早，而又有生產關係，故其衰老期，亦較男子為早。此係指一般女性而言。不過若遇內分泌機能失常之女子，此種現象尤為顯著。凡是卵巢機能失常，或婦女生殖系內機能障礙，則全身之衰敗徵候，立見呈露，此種疾患即在妙齡女子亦有發生。蓋女子之能否保持其青春，完全操持於內分泌等生理機能也。　　患者月經時見超前落後，或數量極微，更由極微而至停經，此即表示已無生殖能力，而轉入暮境。如神經衰弱，肌肉鬆弛，髮白，額紋滿布，貧血，性慾亢進或薄弱。因此患者精神上大受打擊。心中苦悶，失眠，易怒多愁。已婚者更為丈夫所厭惡。使精神更陷痛苦之深淵。　　關於此等婦女疾患，瑞士大學教授戈登拉特氏，在該大學婦科學院中，曾作各項器官治療劑之試騐，曾用「補女容」之液體，注射於处女兎，天竺鼠上，其内生殖器部即發生變化，能使子宮充血，月經復痛，分泌液增多，故極易受孕。戈登拉特氏又云，反遇卵子不易成熟，或因體質關係而不易受孕者，儘可複用「補女容」，即可使月經調整。同時因荷爾蒙增加，故神經衰弱亦愈。且使肌肉細膩，玉容皎潔，恢復青春美。惟女子如尚有白帶病纏綿者，則不妨同時外用「卡爾雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，尤為周密之療，奏效更速矣。姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　診所　四川路寗波路轉角　診時　上午十時至下午六時　　睾丸炎與生殖問題　　睾丸是製造精子之機器，機器損壞，精子即無從製造。　　睾丸是製造精子之機器，而又最易為淋毒侵襲之器官；在感染淋病後之第二或第三星期，即多由後尿道炎而來者，或者在慢性期間，不知必須之攝生，而使病势延進；改成斯疾。大抵此症多起於睾丸之一侧，而以右侧睾丸最为常見。凡起一側者稱為副睾丸炎，其初症狀為全身倦怠惡寒食機不振，鼠蹊部有牽痛之感，及尿意頻數為前驅期。繼又突然發生睾丸劇痛，發熱腫脹，睾丸下垂，大便秘結，此時必須做適當治療，否則往往有陰囊水腫，膿瘍破潰等危險。不幸而變此患，於生殖上必受威脅矣。　　睾丸既為製造精子之重要器官，苟兩側睾丸皆被淋菌所犯，即停止其工作而精子絕矣。淋毒性睾丸炎之與生育上有問題者，原因即在於此。但如能保全一側睾丸，則猶此病之醫治，須內服「克淋儂」以制止淋菌之繁殖與擴張。並用電療以撲滅匿住睾丸組織內之淋菌，庶可早奏消炎退腫，恢復製造精子之能力。蓋「克淋儂」有包圍殺菌之功，非其他透膜殺菌之白濁藥，只有單面之效，致淋菌四散逃奔，變症百出也。余嘗治嚴姓病人。患右側睾丸炎三年，左側睾丸亦將波及。余用電療後，即囑服「克淋儂」至六星期而愈廖。未幾即獲一子。蓋嚴君自患此病後從未生育也多子王的故事  俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師　　……四十多歲時還沒有兒子，　……但在十年中竟有四十三位的公子小姐　　在不里格利都府的祿兀Lovek地方的富翁呌荷恩Ｈoorn他擁有巨大的財產，而其地又是多妻制度的，自然在他這優越的環境，雖說不上紅粉三千，但金釵十二却是有的；可惜富翁的经济能力虽有这样雄厚，可是他的身體，非常的孱弱，真是百病叢生，看看自己這樣環境，竟不能享到人生樂趣，反而增多他的痛苦。他已四十多歲了，雖有很多妻妾，但還沒有一個兒子，眼巴巴看　許多的財產，被人家佔去，所以他求醫服藥的事情無日無之。結果還是失望。　　Lovek自一八七七年八月被俄羅斯所占，所以祿兀屬俄國的。荷恩因為其地偏僻，沒有上藥良醫，因而他就挈家来莫斯科作寓公，後來他的病竟給我們的勞働大學老教授囂得孫Hudson治好了。同時並教他怎樣攝生，後來他回到Lovek故鄉沒有十年，竟有四十三個兒女，一時轟動全俄，播為美談。有多子王之稱。這事我留學俄京勞動大學時囂得孫教授親口同我們說的。　　我們很興奮的問他，那麼那富翁究竟吃的什麽藥呢？　的孫教授捋着自己花白的长髯微笑的說，就是今日風行全球的梅倫氏「補體康」，那時「補體康」一藥，還沒有得到多人的信仰，自從治愈Lovek富翁之後，才為全世界著名醫藥家所矚目，真的「補體康」一藥，對於色欲過度，手淫等而來的性神經衰弱，如遺精，早洩，滑精，勃起力不全，以及頭目眩暈，失眠心悸，記憶力弱，尤其是久婚不姙，房事時快感減少等效力最大。因此藥係用勇健青春期的動物荷爾蒙所製成，服後能充分發揮內分泌機能旺盛的功效。所以能把一切性神經衰弱的疾患掃除，同時性器官矮小的症状，也可以治愈了。這是我在許多臨床上實騐的事情。Lovek地方富翁服此藥而獲多子王之號，在科學上說來，毫不足為奇。世界著名文豪的肺病　文學家為什麽都易患肺癆症  前南洋醫科大學教授鄧源和醫師　　從「作家」載魯迅不願受「人工氣胸治療」說起　　——「肺癆百問」之12—13　　鄧醫師診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時　　奇怪的：肺癆症都喜歡與文學家為緣。你看德國的著名文豪薛勒（Scbiller）氏，就患着重篤的肺病；他的身體總是衰弱，結果倂發結核性腹膜炎死了。俄國文豪高爾基，也患有肺病，足見文人是極易染此病的。　　為什麽文學家與肺病會有那樣的因緣呢？　因為一個埋頭寫作的人，對於肺部是極不適宜的，而且室內的空氣很是混濁，觀於肺病者須移居高山濱海之地，那可佐證。不過肺病人也不一定要如此，在自宅療養只要合法，也容易治愈也。　　上期「作家」月刊載魯迅先生染患着肺病，醫生勸打「人工氣胸針」。因環境不許而作罷。查人工氣胸術的原理，就是用空氣將肺部壓縮，使病灶（患處）縮小愈着。法固至善，但受術者須有其適應症，而且必須受環境的許可。所以藥物療法，至今被認為非常重要。我在南洋醫科大學講授時已注意及此近年得着徒梅博士「補肺拿爾」一藥的應用，對於臨床上獲益匪淺。我把此藥用於各期肺癆的吐血咳嗽，痰多，胸脇刺痛等症侯，約服二個月前後，即可全部治愈。邇來任滬南平民醫院院長，院中肺病人有潮熱盜汗的，服「補肺拿爾」皆見特效，但我以為最好以此藥和男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」同時進服，因為這樣能夠加强體力，而且對於肺病的腦弱失眠，男子遺精腰痛，腎萎早洩。女子月經不調，白帶等，都能一掃而清。可見各國現今用這三種藥合治男女肺病，確然很有見地！胃呆和食滯的治療  鄧源和醫師　　為黨國加餐！　　飲食的重要是誰也不會否認的。然而有了胃病又怎樣辦？當然囉！對于胃病早就有着德國『强胃精』一藥的有效療法，不過胃病的變症，一般人尚不知道。因篇幅所限，只舉『胃痙攣』的疼痛和『胃潰瘍』的吐血，便可明白本病的險惡，　　『强胃精』的功效，不僅在於善開胃和增進化，且有治胃加答兒症的嘔吐，噪雜，胸悶，口臭，口苦，噯氣，噁酸的殊騐。對于腸病的大便秘結，瓦斯多而善屁，下痢，赤白痢，腹痛等，均有特效。又能療腳氣。兼具滋補的溫文而有力之良效。我用此藥治愈的人真指不勝屈云。自慰的轉移性  德國Dr．spigelius原著　武鍾麟醫師譯　　歐洲中世紀尼姑僧侶的秘密性生活　手淫的弊害之遺精及神經衰弱的惟一解救　　凡是獨身者，不管是青年老叟，或是孩童，他們都會要求性的慰藉。最習見的是手淫自慰，患此者多在兩性青春時代。而老密斯與寡婦，失偶的老翁和鳏夫，亦恒嗜此。由手淫引起的症候，便是性神經衰弱。女的有月經不調白帶等，男的便是那萬古不移的遺精症了。　　中世纪在尼庵寺院裏的貞女或修士僧侶，他們過著極端的禁欲生活，所以手淫症極普遍。他們犯着手淫，却幻想着菩薩瑪利亞的可愛，這種對神的『天上之愛』，正是性慾的轉移。那時對于性神經衰弱遺精的治療，只知用些不切學理的方法，故患者只好等待昇天。　　近世經過很多學者的研究，知道專門固止精液只是一種霸道，所以今代生殖器病專家耐而斯博士發明對症治療的『耐而斯遺精片』，它能鎖攝神經，降低慾火促增生育和發育的能力，一時寺院裏採用治療重症的每週六七次遺精或精漏等症，大概二三瓶便可以痊愈，如果和『補體康』同服，救治衰弱，那就更其相得益彰了（載醫藥　編1933）精囊與輸精管炎之合併症  南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師　　陰莖之痛有如虫咬　　患者蒯國昌君，年廿五歲，住北四川路，染淋病後，因性耽運動，故未及全愈，依然馳騁疆場，致病勢突發，肛門會陰，脹痛如裂，小便艱窘，怒責之後，始有微量尿液排出，但有不少膿血相混，小腹疝痛，突發高熱，其陰莖有如虫咬樣之疼痛，時有模糊之精液流出。乃施行直腸觸診法，則精囊，輸精管，腫大異常，又用X光線照之，果然腫大，（有如A圖，）遂斷為精囊炎，輸精管炎合併症。行電療法後，同時進服德國「克淋儂」以排除深部之精囊及輸精管上之淋菌，使炎腫減退，一方淋菌亦因服「克淋儂」後所發生之抗淋素包圍，俾免流竄。故連服僅三星期，腫痛全消，小便快利，惟尿液尚帶溷濁，更服「克淋儂」一星期後，即清澈如常。經顯微鏡檢查，亦無淋系蹤跡，其精囊與輸精管部份，復用X線檢查，則平復如舊矣。（如B圖）此症如不速治，則淋毒必殺死精虫，終身不能生育也。A圖B圖白帶病之有效處置  陳少華　　天天洗滌也不濟事　應當用防腐止泌的做藥　　白帶，似乎每個女子都免不了的毛病，不過有輕重之別而已。但我們不論他輕重，一律要徹底治愈他才好。因為有許多奪取婦女生命的疾病，都起於這白帶病此病多由粗暴的房事或手淫等，把腟粘膜弄破，或身體虛弱，發育不良，或丈夫先有淋病，傳染妻子等而來的。因為白帶病最易招惹細菌，往往有使子宮出血的危險。若是由丈夫的淋病而來的，那末這白帶若沾上小兒的眼內，那他的眼就告失明了，凡是有了白帶，雖天天洗滌局部，也是不行的，必須用『卡而雪地陰道片』為外用的坐藥，以防腐止泌殺菌，就可在短短的三數星期治好了。不過如因身體虛弱，發育不全而來的，可兼服『補女容』，若是因了丈夫傳染淋毒而來的，可兼服『克淋儂』以撲滅內部的淋菌，那更八面顧到，雙管齊下的療法起生命危險。　　不孕之原因何在　　編輯先生：余結婚已近十年，藍田至今猶冷，未嘗生育。曾服XX等劑，均不見效。惟年來頻繁遺精，約一週四五次，當經由友人介紹，購服『耐而斯遺精片』完全治愈。內子體胖，無　病，未知不孕之原因，屬於何人？有何藥可服？又余患早洩，可否使之持久？候教！　　答：不孕之原因，據來函所雲，咎在雙方，蓋尊夫人子宮脂滿，無法受孕，而閣下陽道失　，射精有乖。宜夫婦同服男用「補體康」及女用「補女容」即可見效！　　讀者如有疑難疾病，請詳示地址，寄上海武定路八六九號康健醫藥社收，當卽照答。　　讀者園地　　下開各藥，曾經國內外專科大學畢業醫師切實指定，務須認明指購。切勿因妄信他人言而　購雜牌廉價劣藥，以免服後引</p>

<p>春秋上海與電  （惟經）　　繁榮，我們這個東方巴黎的繁榮，是「電」所造成的。——這麼着說，我想，或許不能算是誇張吧？你瞧；在天空中，是佈滿着像蛛網一般的電綫。　　都市之夜，是充滿着酒與女人的活力的，是充滿着一切物慾的氣息的，但是這一切的唯一映出者，是强烈如日光，或是幽靈似鬼火的電燈光。假使沒有這個普照大千的電燈光，我們這個不夜之城，或許在每天日落之後，早已寂寞得如一個死市了。　　都市之夜，果然是把「電」當作大動脈，可是在白日，也何嘗可以省得電力的供應。電車與電話，這是都市的二根大血管，整個都市的勞力與金融，都靠着這二根大血管，暢達地調劑着。若是沒有了電力的供應，我們這個都市間，是根本不會有摩天大廈出現的。　　電的更大的用途，是普遍地侵入了工業界的每一個毛孔管裏去。大工業，小工業，新工業，舊工業，都非假助於電力不可。紡織，麵粉，印刷，以及任何物品的製造，甚至都省不了電力的應用。所以我們這個都市中，說一句「有一半人口，直接間接的依靠着電氣，而維持生活」或許也並不是一句誇張之話吧？　　電影，無綫電話，這些，是近代的高貴的享受。有綫電報，無綫電報，更維持着國內國外的交通。雖然電的使用，在目前，似乎猶僅畸形地在都市中發展着，但是我是預祝着在不久的將來，每一個農人，也將知道把電力應用到農業上面去，而一掃「　千年來舊法，一成不變」之譏。上海的秋天  胡野吟　　賣糯米熱白菓的歌聲喊滿了長街短巷，那些嘩啦嘩啦的聲音似乎聲聲地在報告着秋的降臨。　　於是，少女們和知春一般快地忙換上丁秋裝，嘴角上泛出秋的微笑，快樂輕鬆不減春天，而實過之。　　但幾天後，賣呌哥哥金鈴子的人將秋的音樂送到人間，小孩子都給引誘得跳了，而且，馬路上或衖堂口會蹲着賣蟋蟀的人，從人堆裏，不時地送出勝利者的凱旋聲。這些，都確定了秋的存在。　　於是，南京路上便飄起秋季大減價的大旗幟，三大公司的櫥窗充滿的秋的意味。再接著，月餅大會的旗幟揚起，冠生園等吃食店的櫥窗裏佈置的分外富有引誘力，於是，召來了一大批的人，可是人的氣息不似乎帶一點秋的意味，不像夏天那末地喘不過氣來。　　因為一個暑天的長期的蟄伏，人們走到馬路上便覺得眼前一鬆。太陽的火箭不再十分的使人討厭，因此，許多大公司大影戲院的冷氣可以停止開放。於是，走在馬路上時的步伐整齊多了，雖然馬路上的人擠上了好幾倍。　　這些都是都市的秋－都市的秋天不會給人一些肅殺的感觸，和消沉的氣息：反之，祗給人興奮，溫柔，不減於春天，而實過之。　　但是，都市的秋真不會使人感到一些不適嗎？　　昨天，天哭了！雨下許多，天氣凉了許多，秋的存在更確定了。　　我偶然地經過一條馬路，心頭上沒有任何心理上的遮蔽，我的心頭沒帶一些秋的悲哀。　　我願馬上離開這都市，因為都市的秋不帶一些美麗的成分，沒有鮮紅的楓葉，沒有枯黃的落葉，可是，冷落，嘶喊，却代替了這些，使秋充分顯示她的死灰色。上海的女嚮導員  周賢　　宴會之後，常是在某飯店中，開着一個房間，合着幾個人,逢場作戲的打打牌，呌呌條子，樂上大半夜，這是我們朋友之間，已成的一種習慣。上星期六的晚上，聚餐會之後，照例的又是合着八九人，去開了一個浴室房間。四位已做成了一桌麻將，餘下五人，覺得打牌不夠味，還不如招幾個女人來玩玩。但是玩女人，招來招去，是那幾個，似乎也有些乏味了，某君一眼　見了玻璃檀面下壓着的某某嚮導社的廣告，於是發起了招女嚮導員來，換換口味。　　依着電話號碼，去通知着，不上一刻鐘，便來了五位摩登女郎。高矮肥瘦，各各不同。其間四位，都是年在二十左右。最後進來的一位，雖然衣服也是穿得不是很漂亮，但是望着已是三十左右的人了。我一位一位的瞧着，瞧到了最後一位，不由得使我一怔。雖然在伊的厚厚的脂粉之下，已完全失去了伊的青春，但伊的輪廓，很清晰地給與我以一個「這是芝」的印象。　　不錯，伊倒還似乎沒把我這分離了九年的不幸者忘却，所以伊一進門，便怔了一怔，很快的便提着我的姓氏招呼着。伊是我家十年前的一家鄰居的女兒，自幼便是長的十分美麗的。程度雖不過是個小學畢業，但態度却是很大方的。我曾對伊熱戀過，我母親也曾為我而向伊家求過婚，雖然伊的媽媽，倒也很有意，但伊却已有了秘密的對手，所以我們的婚事，沒有成功。後來，我家遷居了，從此，便沒有了消息。　　這一晚，突然的在無意中遇到了，相對黯然者久之。我禁不住的問起了伊的近況，伊把眼皮向下一沉，過了好一會，才略略的告訴了我一些消息。原來伊的丈夫，是一位投機家，以前也曾掙過不少錢，在一年之前，大失敗後，曾度自殺，雖然獲救了，但神經錯亂，時發時愈，已成了一個廢人了。家中，還有他的母親，他的妹妹，和三個孩子。一家七口的衣食，都發生了問題，於是伊便被迫得不能不出來幹活，以維持生活。　　最後，我給與了皮夾中所僅存的法幣五元，算是我額外的贈與，當伊用手來接着而稱謝時，我發現在伊的長睫毛巾，蘊藏着一顆晶瑩的淚水。——這一晚，我愴然地驅車回家時，覺得一顆活潑的心，是給重壓着的，覺得似乎比了十年前被拒婚時，更難受着好幾倍。西班牙的牛勁  　　換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒　　女子們的秘密，對父母兄弟全不能吐露一個字的，有時對於他的女朋友，却肯源源本本的說出來。這原因自然是很複雜，而最大的原因，還是朋友裏面，能發生一種同情心。當時友梅只管問夢蘭的話，本來也不便硬逼他的口供，後來提到雜誌，他倒說　有些躲躲閃閃的，這却引起了友梅的疑心，一而說話，一而向夢蘭的臉上看着，因道：你若是要知道　裏面幾位　　　的人是些什麽性格，是怎樣的身世，我倒知道一兩位。你若問我，我可以告訴你，他說着，又作出那很自然的樣子，又不注意到夢蘭的臉上，隨手把那本雜誌拖了過來，翻了兩翻。翻出了作的一頁短篇小說前面，兩手把　　慢慢的按　，把書頁安平了。夢蘭雖是坐在他的側面，眼睛一掃，當然也就看明白了。却是微側了臉，對着墻上懸的一幅山木小吊　，只管出神。不大經意的答道；我要注意這些人作什麽。看他的作品，我並不要知道他為人。友梅見他不大愛理會這些話，就憑目光所到，把那篇小說看下去。將頁而翻過來，倒有一件奇異的事教他又在大海洋裏發現一綫陸地。便是文裏的句子說的　婉一點的所在，全有鉛筆的影子在上面畫了圈圈。把這篇小說，草草的審查一遍，其中大概有十幾處，全是用鉛筆圈過的。再把全冊雜誌一看，長篇短篇，都沒有一點圈點的鉛筆痕跡。便道：這雜誌的上一期在哪裏，看了下文，沒有看到上文，我一點摸不着頭腦。夢蘭指了書架子道：我所有的雜誌，都在這裏，你去翻　。友梅和他是極熱的朋友，當然用不着客氣，就站在書架邊，將書看一本翻一本。在這樣不經意之間，他又發現了自己所覺察出來的，並非神經過敏。就是每本書上，凡是章淚天的小說，都經過了一次嚴密的檢閱。詞句好的所在，都有了鉛筆的密圈。而其他的詩詞小說，却沒有一篇是用鉛筆圈過的。這是很顯明的證據，他看這些雜誌，無非是注意章淚天的文字。友梅站在書架子邊，斜斜的　着書架子。手裏翻着書，心裏便不住的在想着心事。（七九）上海一古石馬  申翁　　目前報載市博物館運來浦東石人石馬，僅運費一項，已達七千圓云云。果是物在我國歷史上深有價值，則費此公帑，尚稱值得。據余所知，更有一石馬，其在上海歷史上價值，似不在浦東之物下。蓋在數年前，舊小南門內喬家浜路，有居戶郭姓，重葺舊宇。匠者掘地，發現一巨型石馬，高約四尺，長達五尺左右。余因近在咫尺，亟往審視，則馬已起直路隅，絕無損壞，形製古樸，與前所見明代墳塋間物頗有異。旋又於得馬處拖北發掘，露出甎槨一角，其地北接藥局衖，東則昆鄰別姓屋基，故僅於甎槨壞處，見中有硃漆棺，題字隱約可辨，知棺中陳死人為一婦女，并有費氏墓道石碣，揆厥形勢，主穴所在，當在東鄰地內也。考費氏為元　書邑　　，　　　　　榕，宋末提舉上海市　，人元以鎮守上海總管府事。因　錄用海船功，官至浙東宜慰使。卒諡榮　，以輕財好施，人呼費佛子。以官吾邑久，遂卜居焉。卒之日，人為　市。其子拱辰，更佔籍吾邑，官至平江等處運　萬戶，爵良顯侯，其孫雄，亦官昭武大將軍」當至元中，吾縣初分，縣學之建，即由拱辰輪貲以成，其於開發吾邑，實具殊功。喬家浜路所發見之墓，規模宏壯，當為其　孫三代中之也。按其時吾邑市　，僅在小東門左近，而小南門一帶，固猶荒郊也。假使揣測非謬，則此石馬實與吾邑之開闢，同其年壽，歷史上之價值，豐不更大於浦　者乎？惜乎地主畏事，遽將是墓覆土重掩，余亦開信較遲，往觀未見，終未明其究竟也，馬則棄置道旁者兼旬，　亦不知畀致何所矣。否則輦致博物館，當尤足令人發思古之幽情也。上海的特殊區域　滿庭坊  茱英　　滿庭坊，一名滿庭芳，是上海租界中的一個好去處。上海人有一句俗語，呌做「餓殺楊樹浦，吃殺滿庭坊，」從這上面，已可見滿庭坊之盛，儘足以使老婆之輩，聞之而垂涎三尺，的確在滿庭坊中，五步一個粢飯攤，十步一個油豆腐綫粉担，此外，还有雞鴨肚腸攤，酒釀圓子攤，麵攤，餛飩攤，露天大菜攤等等。枵腹而來的，只須花上大洋一毛，或是小洋一毛，便不難果腹而去。價廉物美，無以復加，丟了衛生問題不說，這裏真可說得是十足不扣的平民食堂。　　滿庭坊的所在地，是在洋涇浜路（愛多亞路），望平街（山東路），五馬路（廣東路，）大新街（湖北路）等，四條大街，所包圍着的中间。街道都是石皮砌的。天晴了三天，路面，還是顯着很泥濘。而街道的狹窄，有些所在，是二輛人力車不能並行的。在這區域中，沒有鋼骨水泥的大廈，所有的，都是些東倒西歪的屋子。但在這所在，是整天的有西裝少年，摩登婦女，在徘徊着的。不過西裝少年，和摩登姑娘的光顧，却不是來一嚐露天大菜的滋味，而是來購辦便宜貨的。因為在滿庭坊中，望衡對宇的，都是舊貨攤。電料，五金，文具，以及家用雜物等等，在滿庭坊中，是無一不備的。若是有眼力，儘可以一元左右的代價，買的一把也爾鎖。以三四元的代價，買的一支派克自來墨水筆。或以十元左右的代價，買的一架奇異牌的十六寸搖頭風扇。價廉物美，使顧客得到意想不到的滿意。　　老上海們，有些儘着趕上北京路去買舊貨。但是據老於此道者言，北京路的舊貨，還沒有滿庭坊的便宜。因為在北京路，是儘有把舊貨充作新貨賣的。在滿庭坊，却偶有把新貨當舊貨賣。所以在滿庭坊，儘着把討價還着雙對折，還能在若干次的攤主口中「來來來」之下，由攤主忍著痛，說一聲「賣給你」而成交。「望天討價，就地還錢，」這是到滿庭坊買舊貨的八字金言。——鄉下人上城隍廟，老上海上滿庭坊，這可說是買便宜貨的各人的門路。但是到了晚上，滿庭坊是換了一個嘴臉了，鶯鶯燕燕，在黯淡的燈光下，大肆活動而成了一個人肉市場的場面。熙熙攘攘的，每天這麼着充滿着神秘的氣氛。「滿庭坊」真是上海的一個匪夷所思而且是不可思議的去處。上海之住  薑公　　上海在内地民衆的心目中，大都認為世外的桃源，人間的樂土，而久住在這裏的人們，却莫不痛心疾首，呌苦連天，雖然有一部份特殊階級，有綫的或是有間的，度着粉紅的生活，花天酒地，醉生夢死，把上海當作溫柔之鄉，安樂之窩，竭力歌頌着表面的繁華，但這祗是少數的例外，多數的民衆的感覺，決不如此。　　民生四大要素，衣食住行，，在上海，祗有「行」還可以使大衆稍稍得着點實惠，其餘三項,都教人深感着生活水準之高，而日夜焦慮着力不勝任，雖則物質的享受，遠較內地精美豐富，然而這僅僅有利於席豐履厚的生活優裕的富人，給他們錦上添花，可以窮奢極慾的去研究『食不厭精，膾不厭細，狐貉之厚以居』的大問題，至於一般終日勞動專靠出賣腦筋和血汗生活着的人們，就祗好望洋與嘆，是絕對沒有享受的可能的。　　尤其是住的問題，最使人感受到生活鞭策，經濟壓迫的痛苦。那些住在閘北太陽廟一帶，草棚或破船內的窮苦的流民和勞工，姑且擱置着不說，就是我們這許多比上不足比上有餘的中流社會，佔上海居民的大多數的，也都覺得住的問題不容易解決，每月的收入，大部份都供給作租金的支付，每逢到付房租的時候，沒有不愁眉深鎖，暗嘆籌措維艱，擔負太重。　　普通一间小小的半截廂房，或一個客堂樓，只够小家庭的居住的，在交通稍微便利的地段，每月的租金就要花到二三十元，而且還是破爛不堪的舊房子，如果是新近翻造而設備有衛生器具的，那就更昂貴的駭人聽聞了。即如我現在房租的支出，每月也要二十餘元，（在內地差不多可以住着富麗很高大的房子了）所住的祗是小樓一間，既破舊，又齷齪，冬天窗縫裏北風呼呼的自由出入，好像住在水閣涼亭里一般！夏天就更苦了，房間裏簡直是一座火爐，教人熱得喘不過氣來！所以住在上海的人，一到夏天，差不多全家都住露天裏，夜晚上，衖堂中，馬路上，都坐的是人，睡的是人！我因此常常想到：我們出到這樣的租金，尚且受不了這樣的痛苦，那些每月祗花幾塊錢住在鴿籠式的夾板－－閣樓裏的人，終年不見天日，絲毫沒有空氣，便怎麼樣？</p>

<p>時代醫藥刊夫婦智識  美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著怎樣纔能度着美滿的春閨夜　　……兩性生活所需要的一個淺明的常識指導　……愛不能築在契約上應築在健康的基礎上　　有時妻子成婚以後發現她丈夫患有不可告人的隱病中心·大懊惱，雖在新婚甜蜜的時期·也難免同床各夢了。男子的生有隱病和消失性主力的原因·多數是由於淫慾無度及手淫的惡癖。　　靑年人身上如有這虛萎異常的毛病，他就不應該結婚，不明醫理的男子多昧於此理，儘多有悍然不顧，依然娶妻，全未顧及女子的幸福與快樂，對於她是太殘酷了，卽施予這樣殘酷於女子，所以法律上承認這是離婚無可詰問的原因，或者簡直把婚姻作廢，因為婚姻不能實際演出，就不應視為合法。試想，男女雙方一旦遭遇這樣的事，精神與金錢，是不是大大的一筆損失嗎？　　所以這嚴重的事情，每個靑年都要留意挽救，須知道男子的早洩與陰萎，夫婦兩人應把這問題拿來研究，以便看看是否有治好的方法。要緊的是男的必須在一個時期內嚴守衛生的方法，如關於運動，冷水俗等項，對於他的想像力尤須有澈底的統制，便以用藥。　　早洩，陰萎的毛病，並不是不治之症。密亞美大學敎授湯潑森氏（Prof　　Warren　S.　Thompson　of　miami　University）是當代美國的一位著名性病學者，曾經在他的一部學術巨著『人口問題』（Populatior　Problem）的裏面發表了一篇實地調查的記載。他宣佈美國每個陰萎早洩的靑年，年來被生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』治癒的較他種藥品多過三倍，的確，　在美國時曾目睹一位陰萎的猶商人，服『生殖素』祗有兩月，完全治愈，這確為不能度着美滿性生活的對症補救。戀愛失敗的女性將何待？  王士英醫師　　……健美是女子光明的原動力為時代女性所必爭　……臀部的發育和乳峯的高聳為女子美容的基礎　　藉醫藥的功效，助長女性健美上的成就，似乎在近代已經達到了成功之路了。據德國一位著名生理學家勃梯隆氏（Bertillon）和一位美容專家漢謨萊脫氏（Dr.　Hamlet）實地證實女性的發育健全與否，與體內的生殖腺完全有密切的關係。同時霍潑金大學（Johns　Hopkins,　University）博士（Dr.　Knight　Dunlap）的研究，聲明女子的乳峯及臀部的發育，先由生殖腺的强壯，始可得到豐腴的曲綫和健美的體格。博士推論到現代的摩登女子，她們的乳峯所以高聳，肌肉所發達，甚至於勝過衰弱的男子，這裏而最大的原因，完全因為改變了女性生殖腺衰弱的本來面目，近來各地女性方面的體力測騐，以及各種體育記錄，漸漸地要追踪男子，所以鄧博士相信，如能將每個衰弱的女子，特別是發育不全，乳房平坦或萎癟及月經不調等女子，施以生殖腺素內分泌製劑的挽救，誰也不敢武斷說：數年以後，女子的體格和筋力，决不能追及男子的標準。　　根據德國科學新聞通信社的最近報告：德奧兩國女子對於健美運動提倡尤烈，今年上半年六個月之內，凡喪失健美而赴各省醫院及美容院從事於科學的補救者，統計有十六萬九千三百人之多，其中以乳癟及月經不調為最多，估十三萬零零七十四人。此十三萬多的乳癟月經不調之女子，完全被生殖腺素製劑女用『生殖素』治愈者，竟佔百分之八七以上。以此足證生殖腺素內分泌製劑於美容及醫藥上價値的一斑云云。　　的確，科學的權威，可以支配整個二十世紀人類的一切，我們眞不能否認。健美是女子光明的原動力，為時代女性所必爭，臀部的發育和乳峯的高聳同為女子美容的基礎，也是戀愛爭勝的利器，時代的姑娘們，你們站在時代的尖端，須臾不可忘却這利器賜予你們的福利！骨痛常識戕蝕人體康健的骨痛病  俞伯符醫師　　一個人最不幸的是患病；更不幸的是患骨痛病。因為旣患了病，人的康健就被摧殘殆盡。可是普通的病，治之倒不難，惟有患骨痛病的人，治療就不大容易了。因為患了皮膚及肌肉或內臟等病，都有專藥可治，骨痛的情形可就大不相同，他的病根不是深潛在骨的脊髓，便是瘋濕內蘊，以故治之很難了。在從前對於這種病，是毫無辦法的，試觀一般年老的人，簡直什九都患骨痛，每逢天陰節氣，稍作操勞，立刻就四肢百骸，節節痠痛，因為沒有專藥可治，祗可忍受痛苦。直到現在，始由美國　Dr.　Johnston　發明一種『强斯登氏骨痛片』，這樣世人又得了一個救星。治愈骨痛的，何止千萬，人的康健也得了一重保障，且該藥非但能治各種骨痛，且能防止賢臟炎，動脈硬化，中風，尿毒等症，　　患者黃竹庵，五十二歲，患瘋濕骨痛已數十年，壯年任職軍界，馳騁疆塲，且復性好漁色，沉淪慾海，不滿五年，始覺逐漸不支，然尚自譽壯夫，不為遠慮，及至十年前卽感週身疼痛，骨節痠楚，更在陰濕天氣，或交時節，痠痛更烈其後愈患愈重，甚至稍一勞動，痛楚立至，十餘年來，如處水深火熱之境，康健被戕蝕殆無，投余診治後，即斷為瘋濕骨痛，即依强斯登氏法治療，內服『强斯登氏骨痛片』，服完四瓶，此十餘年之骨痛患者已獲根治，且骨節舒暢，重獲健康云。健康播音台被手淫麻醉的靑年  周笑涵醫師　　因遺精而喪失健康的療法　　……神經衰弱症及陰萎早洩幾為遺精者所難免　……將成熟時期的手淫有促成發育不全的危險　　手淫，不論男女，是人人要犯的。實際上，對於身體所生弊害的程度，却因人而異。因了體質，年齡，與共頻度不同，有的呈顯著的弊害，發生種種症狀，有的也會不受什麼影響，不過這是很少數的少數了。　　那麼，有什麼情形之下此種行為（手淫）最能生出有害結果？，由體質上來區分，神經質者，發現此種弊害最為顯著；由年齡上加以觀測，二十歲以下（身體發育猶未完全時期）若犯此種行為過度，比成年人尤其要發生顯著的障碍。因為在那時期，身體幻小，抵抗力薄弱，再加手淫疲勞之結果；能惹起神經系統衰弱，其影響及於全身。弊害難以勝計。　　其他關於頻度問題，不問體質，年齡，若犯手淫過度，違反自然生理，使身體精神疲勞，其影響頗為鉅大，無論在那一方面，都要惹起種種病症了。　　手淫何以使人們遭害這樣深刻？實在因為手淫之後，精液的機會洩出過多，而且手淫只憑不自然的空想力，努力幻想冥索，所以極容易使注意力和推想力衰弱，遺精不免。試想精液旣由手淫排出不已，再加緊遺精的威脅，人體生理上所產生的精液，勢必枯竭餘。遺精之後，就是衰弱的暗示，如不及早將遺精治好，則神經衰弱症接踵而至，同時早洩陰萎發育不全等煩惱病症無可避免　　最有效的治療法，為手淫靑年所夢寢尋求。此有效療法未施行之前，應詳察其被害之程度，如有遺精，滑精者，必須服以『希米脫氏固精片』以鞏固其精關，止制其遺精，為此各國專家所公認的合理對症良藥，年來因此治愈者，成千累萬，余每藉此藥之力，治愈不少的遺精靑年，從未覺得些微困難也。此外如有神經衰弱等癥狀及陰萎，早洩者，那就不可不再服以『生殖素』了。性病講座  姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編　　（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。　　挽近患性病的人，指不勝屈，大槪分析之，其中以患陰萎早洩及手淫遺精二大類最為普遍，凡患上列二病的人，尤以靑年壯年為最，設不早　，前者可使子嗣絕望，生趣毫無，後者能喪精敗元，生命煁虞，二者都是危症，千萬不可忽視也。　　（一）陰萎早洩的治法　　患者金廷榮，卅二歲，河南洛陽人，（主訴）—十九歲結婚迄今，十三年來其妻尚得孕，然其夫人體健無疾，决非不能生育之婦女，實因自身罹陰萎早洩症有以致之，（病歷）—發育時誤犯手淫，更患遺精，四年後結婚，復勞於房事，性神經早就麻痺，交合恒無快感，因之更患陰萎早洩，欲舉不能，旣舉不堅，且觸體卽洩，生趣毫無，更因結婚十餘年，毫無子嗣，萬分焦慮，去秋始來診治，（治療方法）—患者生殖腺內分泌已反正常，亟投生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』內服，使促進生殖腺健全，同時再行電療，手術，每日一次，至初冬生殖機能已完全復健，月前來信已舉一雄，胖碩可愛云。　　（二）手淫遺精的挽救　　患者李菊蓀，廿三歲，任事本埠某交易所，（主訴）弱冠時犯手淫惡癖，初係受不良友人之引誘，其後習慣成自然，每夜必自凟一次，甚至晨起亦必手淫以圖一時快感，因之面黃肌瘦，神經極度衰弱，作事無心，發育亦被阻，及行戒除，遺精即隨之發，每日遺洩更甚手淫，亦無夢，晨起昏懶，終日不適，體益虧損，請為速治，（治療方法）—先投以固精止遺特效藥『希米脫氏固精片』以制遺精，再以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補虛虧，更施行電療促固精關，三面兼治，不到二月，此嚴重之遺精，已霍然而愈，迄今半載，迄未復發，體重已增加十磅云。　　（胃痛根治）　　編者先生：請問胃痛怎樣纔能根治？家母患胃痛，已經十餘年了，現在因為年老發得更勤，時常痛得呻吟不安，見了她那種痛苦難忍的樣子，眞使人難過，請賜根治療法，（呂鶴鵬）　　答：「胃痛靈」治老年胃痛，最具奇效，若並服「健胃素」以强胃臟，而助消化，即可根治。　　（白帶止遺）　　編者先生：患白帶是很痛苦的事，的確不錯，三月前我是受　了它的蹂躪，旣不能　苦人家，更沒有可　的　可以自　，一天褲子要換幾條，而且腰　頭痛，精神頽喪，後來幸同居李嫂嫂介紹到五洲　房購「療帶靈」外用，再服「女用生殖素」方得根治脫我苦海故此介紹（王珍英）　　（未老先衰）　　編者先生：我是罹了靑年的惡習，先犯手淫後患遺精，連續已經六七年了，現在忽現神經衰弱，耳目失聰，且遇事畏縮，鬢　班白，容顏枯黃，衰老不堪，請速賜有效治法（陳　堃）　　答：「希米脫氏固精片」為治遺精聖藥，『生殖素』能促進靑春腺活躍，二藥並服，指日可健。　　（骨痛戒煙）　　編者先生：鄙人素染嗜好，且患骨痛症，吸食稍不自如，骨節即痠痛異常，現思决心戒絕，而所患使人氣餒，因前曾戒過卽因此而重吸者不止一次，故請賜戒煙骨痛兩全方法，不勝感盼，幸甚。（方舉廉）　　答：『强斯登氏骨痛片』專治骨痛，再以『生殖素』培補戒煙，使增加抵抗力，戒絕不日可望。國聯衛生組醫學團　確定治淋的方針  原文載於The　TimeNews香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超轉譯　　……彙集花柳病專家的意見　……參考各名醫的臨床經騐　　德國總理希特勒企圖消滅國內花柳病的傳染，對於花柳病的治療，積極設法加以統制。尤其對於淋病雙球菌的侵害，異常重視。現據可靠方面傳出消息，國聯會的衛生組，鑒於全世界淋病菌的猖獗，自本年份起積彙集各國。淋病專家的意見，徵集各國第一流醫生的臨床經騐，確定其治淋的步驟，日內瓦的時報記者B.　D.　Slainn　氏曾往訽該團主要人物Joison　M.D.博士，據博士云：淋病誠為花柳病最頑固的症候，故特組織專門機關，以之研究，注射療法雖不能趨於一致，而關於內服藥的療法，大都一致推崇黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』為首。該藥之深得全球各名醫的好評，實由德國傑特生博士十五年來研究改進的結晶，誠為德意志在醫學史上最光榮的一頁也云云。（編者按；『安敵淋』之功效，在我國醫藥界已佔無可比並的榮譽，惟女子除服該藥片外，應同時以『療帶靈』為坐藥，以淸除白帶。）戒烟心得戒煙時應注意的幾點  王士英醫師　　戒煙時應注意的幾點，以我臨床的經騐，約有下列三點，（一）測騐戒者的心理，（二）注意戒者的體格，（三）施以安全的培補戒煙法，因為戒者的心理，每多懷着恐怖的痛苦，或因體格的不健全而不勝戒時的痛苦，要解决這兩個難題，那祇有依照第三則的培補戒煙方法有實在的效能。　　培補戒煙法是奧國斯丹那氏所發明，先用生生殖腺製劑培補戒者之身體，使其增强抵抗煙毒力量，再注射『育維賜保命』，以促進新陳代謝，並增强內臟組織，使疾病不易侵入，如是戒法，旣使戒者不受絲毫痛苦，而且安全有效，不難於短時期中完全戒除烟毒。　　有宋永銘者，四十五歲，吸煙已廿餘年，平日吸量甚大，非三錢不能過癮，屢擬戒除，因恐難受痛苦，更因體力不支，故皆未果，後經余即用上項培補戒煙法，內服生殖腺製劑『生殖素』，更注射『育維賜保命』不到二月，煙毒盡除，更無痛苦體亦强壯云。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊肺部透視記  （金德生　　我國素以肺癆病猖獗之區域，偶不經心，即有肺病染身之疾痛，然肺癆雖稱險症，若於未嚴重時期以前，加以診察及治療，則不難肅淸病菌。余弟福生，好學體弱，稍有咳嗆，體重日减。因同居有患肺病者，恐亦為所染，乃偕往法租界父子醫院診治，經該院主任醫師，用愛克司光透視肺部，則左肺尖已呈黑點三四處，右肺亦有一二處黑點，斷為初期肺癆，即加治療，電針並施，不久已咳嗆已愈，體重漸增，三星期後，再用愛克司光透視，則上次所見黑點，已淸滅於無形，而余弟竟脫離可怕之肺癆病，重為活潑之靑年矣，方今科學昌明，利器日多，疾病不致逞其進攻，吾不但為余弟得痊而喜，並告諸世人，凡有肺病之嫌者，及早加以檢查，則可免一切貽誤矣。可靠之治淋法  （敬華）　　靑年男子。涉足花叢。不幸感染淋疾。或怠於治療。或惑於一針斷根·三天包好等不合法之治療。或妄貪便宜。購服假藥。致陷於數月·數年未能全治之慢性淋。不但危害自身。而且傳染妻妾。其結果。男子無精。女子不姙。世稱淋病能滅人宗祧者。良有以也。考慢性淋矣。即俗所謂老白濁者。尿道粘膜上。病　漫患侵淫而成普遍之創面。在後尿道者。尤甚於前尿道。其粘膜顆粒及腺體。皆浸潤肥腫。尿中含有絲條。濁液時有時無。大率稀薄。惟早晨起牀後。尿道口為少許粘液所封閉。其他毫無痛苦，此際淋菌不易證明。蓋淋疾旣轉為慢性。淋菌多深入粘膜下而潛伏。遇有機絲。則復乘勢發作。故欲於粘液中發見淋菌。殊非易事。現今慢性淋之診斷。多利用漿苗之注射。使潛伏深藏之淋菌復出而現於稀薄粘液之內。再以顯微鏡檢查。即得得證明。是故慢性淋之治療。非有可靠之診所斷與夫優良之器械。胥不足以奏根治之效也。前人謂慢性淋為永不斷根之痼疾。良以診斷未得其道。及無相當器械以為之用耳。近世科學益昌。電療醫術。蒸蒸日上。乃有短波電療機之發明。用以治療淋病。特於慢性淋。功效之卓著。超越一切療法。發生高度熱力。深透尿道粘膜之內。對於組織。毫無損害。對於淋菌。可使完全死滅。誠不愧為治淋之利器也。（編者界。寗波路。父子醫院。對於治療淋病之電療器械。可稱有美皆備。如短波透熱電療機一項而論。該院所辦。種類尤多。故往治者。均因症而施治。莫不斷根迅速。其得力於電療。誠非淺鮮也。）免費檢騐男女淋病  （聞琴）　　因為有幾種生殖器病。如攝護腺炎。尿道炎。精液漏等。很像是淋病的徵象。普通人往往不容易辨別。因而私心惴惴。雜藥亂投。反而把病弄壞了。還有一種是淋病未愈。或初染淋病。却不把他認做淋病。因而遷延貽誤。豈不謬哉。要鑒別這種病的原因。最好是用顯微鏡來檢騐小便。可以分別出有沒有淋菌。就可斷定是不是淋病。這樣就不致有盲從醫藥的弊病了。在上海。沒有檢騐淋病。而且是不收費用的。那末只有法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院了。就是婦女之患白帶。而欲檢查是否為淋病者。也很便利。而且是同樣的優待。白帶與生育  （景秋）　　白帶者。指女性生殖器漏出物之總稱也。此白帶。為女性所最煩惱之一事。然白帶之種類極多。凡生殖器之各部疾患。皆能致此。夫健康之子宮體粘膜。其分泌物不多。不過排出少量之漿液性分泌物。而子宮頸管之粘膜。司掌粘液之分泌。通常外子宮口為玻璃樣粘液所閉鎖。若滑脫則自陰道漏泄。以潤澤外陰部。倘其分泌量一旦增加。則漏出不絕。而使外陰部及其周圍或下衣為之污染濡濕。是曰白帶。而白帶之九五%由子宮而來。其主症為慢性子宮內膜炎。現時謂白帶之來於子宮頸管粘膜炎者。寗比子宮內膜炎為多。漏出之白帶。其色不一。有似玻璃樣之粘稠性者。有帶白色粘液膿樣者。有厚而稠或膿者。夫白帶之漏出也。外陰部為之濕潤。自覺非常不快。在肥胖婦女。外陰部及大腿內側之皮膚。因分泌物之刺戟。而發腫脹。灼熱而至糜爛。痛　俱來。殊為苦惱。其經過極慢。患者精神為之不舒。而陷於神經衰弱者不少。考白帶之原因。最多者。由於傳染。其主要者為淋病。故患白帶之婦女。宜速就醫診察。探其原因。原因除去。則白帶自愈。凡淋菌旣侵入子宮粘膜。發生子宮內膜炎者。幸而受胎。着床於子宮粘膜。然經二三月。必起流產。吾國婦女。染有淋疾者頗多。然大都羞不肯醫。以致淋菌上行。蔓延而趨子宮頸管粘膜炎。子宮內膜炎。喇叭管炎。卵巢炎。子宮周圍腹膜炎。而卒妊娠不能。豈非大謬也哉。今有極簡易之方法。能使染有淋菌之白帶。及普通之白帶。均可即最短時期。霍然而愈。其法乃購藥二種。一為內服白帶片。一為外用白帶藥。同時並用。內外兼施。無不克奏全功。該二藥發售處在上海法租界寗路六十四號。父子醫院便是。凡因白帶而艱於生育者。盍一試之。該院並有女醫助診故頗便利云。赤白帶下  （嘯雲）　　赤白帶下。為我國婦女獨多之疾病。月經時之不攝生。產前後之保養不得當。平時洗滌用品之不淸潔。皆足以釀成子宮　道之疾患。其結果為炎症性分泌物增强。輕者為黃白色而黏膩之物。此曰白帶。重則內部黏膜發生潰瘍。表在血管腐損。其分泌物中混有血液。此曰赤帶。有因子宮　部發生腫瘍而赤白帶下者。有因于花柳病毒者。亦有因於體弱萎黃。急慢性單純性之泌尿生殖器疾患者。旣有此赤白帶下之症狀。自有一定之病因。奈吾女界。往往因羞於就醫。遷延時日。致病勢進行。釀成不治。殊深浩嘆。今上海法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院內。經售之『內服白帶丸』及『外用白帶藥』兩種。治婦女淋濁性白帶。以及單純性赤白帶。功效極著。為一般羞於就醫。及偏僻於內地而乏良醫良藥者之唯一自療之聖劑。我婦女界患者其注意之。慢性淋之流弊  （啓浤）　　旣染淋病之後。不事衛生之道。每易建成慢性淋病。此慢性淋病表面視之。初無皮肉之痛苦也。然而病菌之與日俱增。為當然之事。在潛伏期。固無絲毫之感覺。但一旦爆發。則病勢之烈。有過於患急性病時之痛苦幾倍之。且淋病釀成之睪丸炎。攝護腺炎。淋巴腺炎。四肢關節腫痛等症。於極盛時代。固極痛苦。即使炎勢减退。往往留有結節。小則動輒發炎。重則器管為之失其效力。其最著者。即一度患過睪丸炎後。子嗣即生阻礙。攝護腺一經發炎後。時有早洩陽萎等症之續發。故凡有淋病者。宜早期醫治。並治之必至斷根為止。切弗因循誤事。致流弊叢生。悔之晚矣。然而治療不得其當。則弊害更深。是所以擇醫不得不愼也。上海法租界寗波路六十四號父子醫院。為滬上花柳病院之較可靠者。聘有男女醫師。臨診上之經騐豐富。一切電療等設備之完善。診治時之悉心週到。均有足可取者。肺腑語  （乃昌）　　肺為司呼吸唯一之重要器管，亦頗易受病菌侵襲之區域也。我國病肺者獨多，因肺癆菌之散播力甚强，一旦被染，即起種種咳嗽吐血萎黃盜汗等症，肺部之潰爛亦日益擴大，而人體不支矣，但肺病之初期，自覺症狀極微，故人多忽之，方今科學昌明，有X光可以透視肺部，凡有疾病，均可一望而知，今有法租界寗波路父子醫院，公開肺部健康檢查，取費甚廉，故紳商學界，前往檢查者。絡繹不絕，誠醫界之好消息也，X光集團檢查  （則民）　　父子醫院，素以設備完美治療週到，馳名於世而該院對於電療機，機設備，尤稱冠絕一時，所辦機械，均屬式新效大，加以運用之經騐豐富，故凡一經電治者，無不病恙得瘳，其中尤以短治電療器之療治慢性白濁，堪稱世無其匹，該院尚有X光集團檢查之舉，凡有肺病嫌疑者，個人或團體，均可前往檢查，取費十分低廉，因限止人數關係，X光檢查時間，訂為上午時起下午四時止云。談言菜塲關門  夢若　　最近據工部局捐務處的報告：近三年中，公共租界內，菜塲日趨减少。民國二十三年七月，有菜塲六千七百五十二處。至二十四年七月，只六千五百三十四處，較上年减少二百十八處。降至今年七月，僅五千九百九十二處，較前年减少七百六十處，較去年减少五百四十二處。　　上海在過去，發展實是可驚的。人口日有增加，差些就突破四百萬的紀錄。地價的飛漲，一日千里。値錢的每畝一二十萬，便宜的也要幾萬幾千。建築方面，竟像在競賽。你造一座十二層，我便建一座二十四層。此皆表示大都市的繁榮。　　然黃金時代終不能久留，上海近年來被經濟恐慌狂潮的打擊，已逐漸衰頽下去。銀行錢莊的宣告淸理，時有所聞。大小公司商店，也常此跌彼仆。能勉强維持的，還須掛大减價的旗幟作號召。此又足見工商業捉襟見肘的一斑。　　便以居民的生活而言，一種困頓的情狀也充分顯露上海景况的黯淡。儘管跳舞塲影戲院咖啡館，呈熟嗣的氣象，此只是少數享樂者醉生夢死的表現。大部份人，貧窮的失業的，自必呌苦連天。便是普通家庭，也要縮衣節食，才可度日。　　別的不講，菜塲關門，算是最好的說明。衣食住三件生活要素，以食為第一重要。菜塲是供給日常食品的地方，一天不能停市。但上海公共租界內的菜塲，近三年來，却也和商店的倒閉一樣，日趨减少。去年比前年减少二百十八處，今年又比上年减少五百四十二處。人民的生活難，於此可見。　　此原因究在何處，是不難指出的。就是一般居民，受市面蕭條約影響，生活不得不因陋就簡。需要旣减少，供給也便隨之而减少。不久以前，猪肉漲價，食肉的就减少。荳腐漲價，食荳腐的也减少。此又足使菜塲冷落，照此下去</p>

<p>，上海的菜塲，今後必定還要繼續關門。　　由菜塲的减少，又可想見其他做油鹽柴米生意的，也不能有好市面。再推而至一般商業，衰敗的情形，更難以避免。那末上海繁榮的恢復，當不是最近的事。外表的點綴，恐終掩不住內裏的慘淡。洞庭西山成金煤鑛鑛區巡禮  方舟　　（本報特稿）洞庭西山孤峙於汪洋三萬六千頃的太湖中，為七十二奇峯之一：其地多山均險境，風景秀麗，土質肥沃，氣候溫和，物產豐富，故甚宜於農林畜牧。全山面積遼廣，尤多巒峯，但地廣人稀，荒山實佔一半以上。這些荒山却非常適宜於種茶值菓，造林放竹。山中蘊藏極富，除煤，石，鑛之外，尚有鐵石，紅泥，白泥等鑛，最近在山的東區方面又給人發現了一處磁鑛，現正由人投資試行開採，此外據說還有人曾經在山的南部發現過鐵苗，却沒有人探過，所以量之多寡，尚難證明：總之該山如果能加以建設與　植，當為江南一大富源也。　　至西山之有煤鑛，迄今已有三十餘年：在前淸光緒二十九年，卽由邑人羅甘嘗從事探採，宣統元年正式領照開辦。民國成立後換領新照，並推廣鑛區至十方里，民八因乏資停工，民十七呈前實部續開，旋又以時局影響中止，至二十一年冬，遂另闢新鑛區二萬七千餘公畝，並已發現火煤。　　以前開採，皆用人工，且全區鑛窿口計有九座，糜費甚巨。其鑛窿之工程，有已工竣者，有尚未工竣者，其最深者有六十二丈，最淺者亦有十多丈，口徑之大者有十一丈。此九窿中，除三窿作廢而不能再開外，尚有可以繼續開採者一窿，工作未完備者一窿，現正在開始裝機開採者有兩窿。窿中煤苗已發現者有兩層或四五層，每層三四尺至五六尺不等。照現在的範圍推算，每天每窿約可出煤三四百噸。惟據多數鑛師測騐，內中所藏煤量至少有五千萬噸以上，至煤的性質係半烟煤，熱度頗佳，合於機器鍋爐之用。並迭經化騐，將來可與中興煤相伯仲，前曾將煤樣運滬錫試銷，每噸可售價八元以上。　　現該鑛已由羅甘嘗與王儒堂昆仲等訂約合辦：用利民公司的名義開採，自本年四月間籌備迄今，刻正在整理我鐵鑛，建築鐵屋，整頓鑛窿，及裝置摩達鎊浦等，大約再有一兩個月的工程，便可正式採煤了。　　我由該鑛趙主任陪同着在鑛區裏巡視，他並且告訴了我許多鑛裏的情形，及王先生等的歷史，他說：現在暫由利民公司出資二十萬元，用利用民煤鑛公司的名義與成金合作。　　鑛區就在桃花塢天王門口，周圍都築着板蘺，從路傍的一個缺口處走進去便是鑛塲。臨時辦事處就設在新建的倉庫屋裏，正式辦事處及鑛屋尚在建築中，右首是機匠間，鐵匠間，本匠間：中央是鍋爐間及摩達間，水汀間，下面角上還有兩座鎊浦間。　　裏面現在已裝置的有一架皮帶摩達，和兩只鎊浦，一只是從不井裏引水到貯水亭中，經過沙濾，然後轉到水汀鍋裏，一只是抽煤窿裏的到外面去的。還有一只鎊浦正在裝置中。　　前面兩個煤窿，一個三十二丈的已在抽水整頓，並且用人工以盤桶在吊窿里的煤蓋——烏泥——起來，吊起來的煤蓋就舖在鑛塲上，把一個鑛塲舖塡得十分平坦，十幾個工人却將這盤桶推得很快，那薑黃色的水，便由一根鐵管裏流出去，倘在山澗裏面；上面架着一塊鐵板，是鐵面上和鐵窿裏傳通聲氣用的。　　十七丈那口窿，現正準備動工修筑，六十二丈的那口，暫時却不預備開採。　　他們為了取水便利，在鑛塲傍邊開了兩口水井。至將來運煤的計劃，他們擬裝設輕便鐵道運至太湖碼頭，用帆船載輸，或以小火輪拖帶。現在將他們規定的水程及運費錄在下面：　　由洞庭西山至上海，計程三百華里，船價每噸一元八角。至無錫三百二十華里，船價每噸一元。至蘇州九十華里，船價每噸八角。湖州一百華里，船價每噸八角。……至於江陰，常州，宜興，杭州，南潯等處，均朝發夕至，一水可通；交通方面，堪稱便利。　　煤量方面，現探得三十二丈的那口窿裏，十五丈卽有煤苗四五尺，其餘如十八丈，二十二丈，二十九丈等，均為煤層，十七丈一窿，與三十二丈者相同。　　據說煤窿下面的鑛穴，已開挖至三百多尺，其形式好像一條一條約弄堂，裏面可容百餘人工作。現在已有鑛工及各項工匠四五十名在這下面工作着。　　目前鑛裏暫時祗僱有職員及工人百餘名，如將來正式開採時當須廣為招用，至於鑛工的待遇，最高的不過六七角一天，最低者則僅有三角多。且皆不供膳宿。　　當我巡視過了成金的鑛區之後，又有人告訴我植裏　方面也有一個鑛區，現在由永興公司在用土法開採。　　一大壘的召租和一大堆没有屋子住的人。  雪　漁村瑣記  允海　　漁船從西江很順利地回到村里來了。婆娘們牽着孩子，也搶着到埠頭來迎接她們的上了年紀的爸爸，和年靑力壯的丈夫。　　這一趟船走了十多天，雖然托天爺的福，沒風也沒雨。不過，照例的那可怕的念頭還是一樣地在人們的心里作崇。誰又不害怕——水上生活，象那沒根的浮萍一樣喇，誰保得過了今天，有沒有明天。　　現在，這大大小小的一批總算放下了一籮心事了。也可以算過了這末一個關頭了，這一次可以不做孤兒寡婦了。儘情的快樂吧，好人已回來，生活算是憑天老爺的福，又可快快活活地過上幾天放浪的日子，快樂吧，儘情的快樂吧，過了這幾天，誰又管得放下一水船，大家的性命是掛在那一根梢上。　　「下一水船？……」　　遲頓的，陰沉的說話，從船老大，那帮了老闆三十多個年快的李老福爹的咀吧溜出來了。人們都驚奇而害怕地凝視着這奇怪的老頭兒。老頭兒的心像鐵一樣硬，也一樣無情，他沒有立刻便回答，還是那付老模樣，抽出筒農夫牌的熟烟，在發狂般吸着，長滿了灰白的鬍子的咀吧，還在那末作威作福地吆喝着：　　「契弟，收帆啊！……漁罩怎末不弄乾凈點？……還有那網喇？…！大食懶，又要作賤了！……」　　然而，終於，漁船收拾得一乾二凈</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>了。人們快要擁了妻兒回家的時候，在老三那不能忍耐的傢伙的催促下，他，這老頭子慢吞吞地說了：　　「老闆關照，下水船或者歇一歇，最少，也得請幾個伙計停一水兩水。他說，這生意不好做啦。……咳咳咳咳！　　（讓你這老傢伙咳嗽死了吧）！——人們在不滿地咀咒着。　　咀咒？何要埋怨谁？伙计是别人用铜钱僱请的，歇生意也用不着打什末合同，走嗎走好了，誰管得着，不過——　　「是喇，不過，是誰停生意？也應該講一講麼」！　　儘管人們在焦燥着，老頭子那爛咀也再不講第二句。天曉得，埋怨他也不是道理，他也不懂得哩，怕不是他們自己便是第一個要滾蛋的。　　於是，人只好等待着一天，又天的。（未完）播音節目歌曲介紹　　子夜歌　　今日下午六時半至七時一刻的上海歌劇社周潔在華興（一二六〇）電台唱出　　那小鳥刮刮刮刮呌不絕，　　我的他登時道離別，　　敎我心滾滾滾着熱血，　　須臾頓刻就想分別。　　鳥啼天未明，沒來由驚動我的人，　　可憐他黑暗圈裏行，　　且從容向前向前進。　　可恨透的鴉，亂吵鬧驚動我的他，　　我們倆受到欺和詐，　　以為大亮拉快回家，　　倒難免人多言誰愛說話，　　料不倒剛剛夜半。　　月兒灣雲見掩，小小星光淡，　　活生生分去軍邊伴，　　日光悠悠彷彿靈魂散，　　只留下一聲一聲嘆。特別節目　　新兒童播音團　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時半至五時一刻　　One　night　love　（鋼琴獨奏）　　月光光歌　（露葳）　　國旗歌　（陳融）　　小夜曲（口琴獨奏）　（程義春）　　船夫曲　（飛莉）　　節儉歌　（范麗）　　旋風的原理　（自然常識）　（程義春）　　誰說我們年紀小　（朱斌）　　鳳陽花鼓　（螢螢）　　比翼鳥（口琴二重奏）（程義春）（陳融）　　睡的讚美　（露葳）　　小鸚哥　（飛莉）　　卡門（口琴獨奏）　（陳融）　　大地行軍曲　（朱斌）　　娘子軍歌　（螢螢）　　大文學家王安石（名人故事）　（白輝）　　光明之路　（范麗）彈詞　　曹笑英玉蜻蜓　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「影星集錦」　　一枝「玉梅」報春回。「莘園」景色得重開。絲絲「楊柳靑」色照。「灼灼」桃花艷霞堆。「燕燕」隨風爭相逐。「胡蝶」穿花興未闌。剎那間，滿園春色「競芳」里。一聲聲「杜字」歸去促春殘。「麗蓮」放。「倩蘋」繁。月「娟娟」。風「徐來」。聽雷「賽珍」樓。乘凉「吉亭」畔。窗外幽「蘭君」記取。「芑香」滿室人我懷。又只見，月揚「明暉」銀河　。畫屏初展「織雲」飛。一片「光明」萬里白。多少「秋心」應向此中看。黃花廋。「耐霜」寒。「孤雁」聲高入雲端。那曉得，一夜「秋風」幷秋雨。平添了，幾重「秋痕」濕蒼苔。「胡笳」奏。「逸葦」翻。「古松」巍巍風前站。孤衾難眠頻「夢石」。呵凍臨窗賦「雪懷」。只道是，「獻齋」夜冷難度寂。幸賴那盆裏「耐芳」伴歲寒。「醉翁」之意聊可慰。　　邢瑞亭三笑　　麟記（一二二〇）下午九時零五分至十時　　開篇「新寳玉探病」　　怡紅公子與　卿。兩小無猜各有情。不料天公偏嫉妒。使佳人抱病困愁城。嬌軀臥在瀟湘館。小婢嘗將藥茗烹。歎息知心人缺少。心中感觸淚盈盈。忽聞鸚鵡聲聲喚。說有客敲門呼鵑婢名。急命丫鬟房外去。問何人到此要聽淸。那丫鬟奉命將門啟。見是寳玉前來便觸景又生情。因為他夤夜而來是難得事。足見他，多情多義自天成。急忙接過燈籠後。便引導進門脚步輕。走到床前來禀告。說寳二爺今晚一人行。親身到此來探病。奴一片誠心代主迎。他已到床前來見你。我有何曲直好請他評。黛玉聽。百感幷。宛如久雨見天晴。有千方萬語從何說。勉强輕輕呼表兄。說二嫂欺人眞太過。我多愁多病要氣得命犧牲。那老祖宗待我雖厚。我有病終難鳴不平。你莫望奴身能勿藥。只怕要，來生再會結山盟。寳玉聽。心內驚。勸她莫與性命爭。將身軀保重求無恙。把萬事拋開希望命運亨。勸罷一番方告別。區區難作不平鳴。只好，做此開篇唱幾聲。　　周振玉義妖傳　　元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半　　蘇州風景開篇　（咪咪集剏刋號）　　姑蘇本是闔閭城。風土淸幽久著名。春夏秋冬共四季。良辰美景最宜人。金勒馬。油碧輪。還有那米家船書畫十分精。往來都是名流輩。韻事流傳互古今。春　鄧尉把梅花採。香雪海鴻雪證前因。三月十三開個琵琶會。紅男綠女鬧盈盈。支型山別墅詩支遁。最希奇是朝天萬笏的范家墳。夏日炎炎如焚火。最好是扁舟一葉出葑門。荷花蕩幽賞襲淸芬。到晚來　一個雨淋浴。赤脚歸時興倍增。秋風容易秋光老。木穉花香透一輪明。忽聞珠喉宛轉笙歌沸。石湖串月畫船行。遊遍靈岩十八景。抬頭望見一帘靑。說道石家店擅煮巴魚羹。自從于右任壁王題詩後。江鄕風味賽鱋蓴。過了秋來冬又到。正是天平楓葉醉霜辰。萬紫千紅嬌欲滴。勝比看花二月春。賞雪有時登虎早。冷香閣上曲欄憑。白茫茫不見獅子回頭望。只覺得光搖銀海凈無塵。客舟偶向楓橋泊。寒山寺隱隱報鐘聲。張繼詩魂入夢淸。一年好景從頭數。勸君莫負此光陰。破工夫蠟履早來臨。　　上海市（九〇〇）每日節目　　上午　　九·一〇　愛國音樂　（黨歌，禦侮，紀律，我們的國家，為國爭光，國旗歌）　　九·三十　市政府紀念週　　一〇·三十　平劇　（桑園寄子，春燈謎，簾錦楓，草橋關，杏元和番，得意緣）　　一〇·五〇　休息　　一一·四五　西樂</p>

<h3>British Diplomacy and Regional Security</h3>
<p>— Ou</p>
<p>The Marquess of Salisbury of Britain once said, "The most common error in politics is clinging to the corpse of outdated policies." British diplomacy at present seems unwilling to shake off such an error. Britain's post-war policy of suppressing France and promoting Germany has clearly created an unstable situation on the European continent. Now, not only is Germany arrogant and despotic, but Italy is also like the ancient Romans, with a tendency to view the Mediterranean as "our sea." In the midst of this double attack, will Britain advocate that democratic countries unite to resist Fascism, or will it feign cooperation with Fascism in order to preserve the past authority of the British Empire? Time no longer allows it to maintain its previous ambiguous attitude. The environment has forced it to have a clear position. However, regarding the views of various leaders within the Conservative Party, opinions are still divided and there is no consensus. Churchill, an opponent within the Conservative Party, advocates that the democratic countries of Britain and France should unite to defend the legacy of democracy and deal with the threat of Fascism. Churchill's proposal certainly has considerable momentum, but it is very different from the proposals of conservative party figures in power such as Baldwin and Chamberlain. In today's British Conservative Party, we cannot ignore Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. We know that although the current leader of the Conservative Party, Baldwin, still holds the position of Prime Minister, his retirement is only a matter of time, and Chamberlain is the most promising candidate to succeed him as the leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister. Now that Chamberlain has become the soul of the Conservative Party, his proposals deserve attention.</p>
<p>Speaking of the proposals of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, we can get a glimpse of them from his speech at the "1900 Club" in June of this year. He said, "Since the collective system has suffered a serious failure due to the Italo-Ethiopian War, the most appropriate approach is to seek the possibility of 'regionalizing' the world's dangerous areas and to devise a plan to deal with them. This plan should be guaranteed by those countries that have a close relationship with the dangerous areas and be approved by the League of Nations." In other words, it is to replace the so-called collective security with the regionalization of war and to replace the League of Nations with regional security pacts. This proposal can be further proven by the recent speech by British Foreign Secretary Eden at this year's League of Nations General Assembly. According to Eden, "In the opinion of the British government, regional agreements can enhance the implementation of the League of Nations, so the British government is determined to negotiate such agreements with Western European countries." Although these words are extremely simple, they are enough for us to see the future trend of British diplomacy. In the future, Britain's diplomacy with Europe will likely inherit the legacy of the London Agreement, on the one hand, concluding a Western European regional pact to bring Germany to heel and ensure the security of Britain's northern border, and on the other hand, concluding a Mediterranean regional pact to bring Italy to heel and maintain Britain's dominance in the Mediterranean. Whether Britain's wishful thinking can be realized is a big question in light of the current situation. Italy is deeply dissatisfied that the League of Nations allowed representatives from Ethiopia to attend this year's League of Nations General Assembly. Germany has not yet responded to the British proposal of April 27 regarding the eleven-point treaty for Western Europe. Therefore, the future of the new Locarno Conference convened in London is still very uncertain. As for what results the five-nation consultation can achieve, it is certainly impossible to talk about.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Collection Imminent; Ministry of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Liaise Separately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has dispatched personnel to various provinces and cities to liaise on the collection of income tax. The personnel and their respective destinations are: Liang Jingchun to Shanghai, Zhang Sen to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, Zhang Jun to Shandong, Henan, Hunan, and Hubei, Chen Duan to Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, Guan Jiyu to Sichuan, and Zhang Tingxiu to Yunnan and Guizhou. Those who have already departed are Liang Jingchun, Chen Duan, Guan Jiyu, and Zhang Tingxiu. Zhang Miao, Zhang Jun, and Huang Zubei are scheduled to depart on the 28th, first heading to Zhenjiang, Jinan, and Fuzhou, and then transferring to the respective provincial capitals to liaise. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) With the collection of income tax imminent, the Ministry of Finance instructed Guan Jiyu, the Sichuan Finance Special Commissioner, to first negotiate nearby in Sichuan and provide guidance on tax collection in the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, in order to facilitate its implementation. Having received the order, Guan has begun contacting various parties in Chongqing and is actively proceeding. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Slight Improvement in Rural Economy in the Suburbs of Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) This year, harvests have been abundant everywhere and grain prices have been stable. Early rice in various places has had a full harvest, while late rice has had a slightly poorer harvest due to a slight lack of rain during the grain-filling period, but it is still far better than in previous years. Since the new grain has entered the market, grain has been continuously arriving in Beijing. The docks south of the city receive 3,000 shi of rice daily, while the docks in Xiaguan receive more than 1,000 shi. Huangshu rice produced in Anhui sells for 7.56 yuan per shi, medium-grade rice for 6.8 yuan, and inferior coarse rice for 6.2 yuan. The amount of black rice arriving is not large, with a price difference of 2 yuan per shi. The highest retail price for Huangshu rice is 8.34 yuan per shi. Last year, the selling price of new grain was 1.8 yuan per shi, while this year it is priced at 2.9 yuan to 2 yuan, which makes farmers quite optimistic. The price of new rice, at around 8 yuan per shi, is still at a normal market price. The rural economy in the four suburbs of Beijing has shown a slight improvement. Many rice merchants are suffering losses. The population of Beijing exceeds one million, and whether the rice market planned by the municipal government can be realized this year is still uncertain. According to a survey of Beijing's grain distribution, the daily grain requirement is three he per person, so the daily total requirement is more than 3,000 shi, and the monthly requirement is 100,000 shi.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Authorities for Instructions; Earnestly Hopes for the Success of Political Construction to Create a Model Province; Four Fundamental Points for Future Political Improvement</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened the Chairman of the Provincial Government, the heads of various departments, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Mayor Zeng at the Huangpu Headquarters at 5:00 PM on the 27th. Except for Chairman Huang, who was absent due to illness, the rest gathered on time. Chairman Chiang had just returned from visiting Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai and immediately received them. In addition to inquiring about the progress of the Provincial Government and the work of various departments, he also gave a brief speech, stating that Guangdong Province is uniquely blessed, the richest of all provinces, and the rivers and mountains are beautiful, making it a solid foundation. He decided to reorganize the Provincial Government to bring about a new era, and the expectations of the Central Government are high, as are the hopes of the people of Guangdong. He personally regards it as his hometown and earnestly hopes for the success of political construction in the province in order to create a model province of the Three People's Principles. There are approximately four fundamental points for future political improvement: First, diligent investigation to seek out talent, because the most important thing in governance is to obtain talent, and to obtain talent, one must emphasize investigation. The strengths and weaknesses of subordinates, as well as their diligence and laziness, merits and demerits, must be strictly investigated at any time. Every week and every month, there should be public evaluations, with rewards and punishments accordingly. Then, the virtuous and capable will be encouraged to strive harder, and those who are unwilling will be warned to improve. Everything can be done to obtain talent. Second, seek speed and accuracy to revitalize. To improve politics today, one must first eliminate the corrupt habits of the old government. When it comes to handling affairs, one must first value time, save time, and strive for speed and accuracy, eliminating the accumulated habits of delay and procrastination. Only then can efficiency be increased and administration revitalized, and the spirit of lethargy and procrastination can be invigorated, creating a new atmosphere of striving for progress. Third, endure labor and grievances in order to reform. Anyone responsible for handling affairs must not shirk labor and grievances. The situation in Guangdong is complex, and there are many accumulated problems. Regardless of the facilities in any area, whether it be people's livelihood, wealth, education, or construction, there must be a determination to thoroughly innovate, an attitude of utmost impartiality and integrity, courage to act when seeing righteousness, and endurance of labor and grievances. Do not repeat the past mistakes of following old ways and fearing the consequences, so that we can reform the politics of Guangdong and create benefits for the people. Fourth, cooperate to ensure success. The establishment of institutions is for the division of labor, and the unity of the government is most important for cooperation. After all, careers are related to each other, and responsibilities are linked in every place. Without cooperation, success cannot be achieved in each area, and success or failure is a whole. It is hoped that everyone, under the guidance of Chairman Huang, will work together, diligently, frugally, respectfully, and strictly, establishing a clean and capable government in the shortest possible time. We have high hopes for this. After Chairman Chiang finished speaking, it was already dusk, and the officers who had listened to the instructions departed. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>National Election News</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters recently issued a circular to the General Supervisors of elections in various provinces and cities, instructing them on the method of signing and annotating opinions regarding candidates. The original order briefly stated: "Article 14 of the Election Law stipulates that 'the provincial government may sign and annotate opinions on the candidates elected by each electoral district before submitting them to the National Government for designation.' The provisions of this article indicate that it 'may' sign and annotate opinions, rather than 'should' sign and annotate opinions. Therefore, it is permissible to choose whether to note for reference, without limiting the number of designated candidates, nor is it necessary to annotate under the names of all elected candidates." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice has reviewed and instructed on the case of a lawsuit claiming the invalidity of a national assembly election confirmation, requiring the plaintiff to pay litigation fees. It was determined that election lawsuits are to follow the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore litigation fees should be collected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters has noted that the names of local public fund agencies in various counties differ considerably across provinces, with some called "Public Fund and Property Management Office" and others "Finance Committee." However, in essence, they are different in name but the same in function. The Headquarters has decided that all county-level financial agencies equivalent to the Finance Bureau, whose function is to manage local funds and properties, should be treated in the same manner as the directors of the Public Fund and Property Management Office, subject to the restrictions of Article 58 of the Implementing Rules of the Election Law. A circular will be sent to the General Supervisors of each province for their information. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News reporters Guan Yixian and others telegraphed the Central National Government on the 27th, requesting that they find a way to remedy the election law for representatives of journalist organizations. Their original telegram is as follows: "To the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, with great respect. The decision to convene the National Assembly has been met with national rejoicing. According to the provisions of the annex to the Representative Election Law, journalist organizations may elect eleven representatives to attend, demonstrating the Central Government's great emphasis on public opinion. However, the situations of journalist organizations vary across regions. Only a few major cities have established organizations. Important cities such as the capital, Tianjin, and Xijing have yet to do so. In other provinces, organizations may have been established in more than a dozen counties and cities. If the election law is followed, the resulting election may lead to a distorted state, with certain areas dominating the representation, which would be insufficient to represent the entire country and would not be welcomed by fellow journalists in a small number of regions. The Beiping journalist organization, in addition to nominating candidates in accordance with central laws and regulations, offers the above suggestions based on our limited perspective, urging the Central Government to consider the actual needs, be flexible, and find ways to remedy the situation so that major cities with particularly developed news industries can have representatives participate in the Assembly and contribute their opinions. We anxiously await your prompt response." (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>France Implements Currency Reform, Creating a New International Situation; Various Countries Urgently Seeking Response Measures; Netherlands Orders Gold Export Ban, Effectively Abandoning Gold Standard</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the new currency bill, the government anticipates that the House of Representatives will approve it at tomorrow's meeting. However, the attitude of the Senate is still uncertain. The government is continuing to draft multiple legal bills to complete the adjustment of the franc's value. Internationally, the franc's devaluation has created an unprecedented situation, with various governments either taking new measures or convening emergency meetings to discuss how to respond. The details are as follows: (1) The Dutch government has ordered a ban on gold exports, and all exchanges in the country are scheduled to close for two days next Monday and Tuesday. (2) German leader Hitler specially convened a meeting yesterday with Economics Minister and President of the Deutsche Bank, Schacht, Finance Minister Clausieck, and Foreign Minister Neurath. In addition, the leader also convened representatives from the industrial sector to study the situation created by the franc's devaluation. (3) Czech Prime Minister Hodža, in a statement to the press, said that the Czech Republic devalued its currency in 1934, and the current devaluation of the franc has no impact on the Czech Republic. Therefore, the country does not intend to take any special measures. (4) The Turkish Prime Minister recently issued a public statement saying that the government does not intend to change the currency system, and the value of the Turkish currency will still be determined by the central bank and will not be affected by foreign influences. (5) Romanian officials also stated that after the devaluation of the franc, the European economy would be able to restore prosperity. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam The government today ordered a ban on cash exports. In effect, the Netherlands has also abandoned the gold standard. (National dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam According to an announcement by the authorities, the Netherlands can no longer maintain its gold standard. The Dutch Stock Exchange will be closed on Monday and Tuesday. The Dutch Bank has agreed with the government to implement a ban on gold exports starting today, September 27th. Another announcement stated that the Netherlands has not abandoned its gold standard. Since Switzerland's devaluation, it has been difficult for the Netherlands to maintain its currency policy unchanged. Therefore, the Dutch government has had to reconsider its position, as the Netherlands is now the only country on the gold standard and feels the highest degree of pressure on its exchange rate and gold reserves. The government is now prohibiting gold exports in the hope that the Netherlands can avoid leaving the gold standard. The details of the government's intentions will continue to be announced on Sunday. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>French House Finance Committee Discusses New Currency Bill; Content Divided into Five Chapters and Twenty-Four Articles; Franc's Value Set at Nine-Tenths Fine; Failure to Report Hidden Gold Subject to Fine Equal to Amount</h3>
<p>(Paris) The House Finance Committee began discussing the new currency bill at 2:30 PM today. The bill consists of five chapters and twenty-four articles. Finance Minister Olivar reported the main points as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 advocates abolishing the currency law promulgated in 1928, which was used to restore the gold standard. The legal value of the franc will henceforth be set at nine-tenths fine, i.e., 0.043 grams to 0.049 grams (originally nine-tenths gold 0.0655 grams), and an exchange equalization fund will be established, placed under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and operated by the Bank of France, to stabilize the relationship between the franc and gold. In other words, the Bank of France may use this fund to sell or purchase foreign currency. In addition, the government entered into an agreement with the Bank of France the day before, allowing the bank to revalue its existing gold reserves (according to the Bank of France's existing gold reserves, before the franc's devaluation, they were worth a total of 511,000,000,000,000 francs; now that the franc has been devalued, the amount will naturally increase). This agreement should be approved by the parliament. (Article 4 of Chapter 1 of the new currency bill) The gold reserves held by the issuing banks in various territories may also be revalued in accordance with this agreement. In addition, international expenditures that have been stipulated to be paid in gold coins before the implementation of the new currency law will not be bound by this law. Once this law is implemented, all imports, exports, and transactions of gold bars, gold nuggets, and gold coins will be prohibited, except with special permission from the Bank of France. Chapter 2 advocates nationalizing all gold.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 advocates that all gold in the country should be nationalized, with measures to prevent speculation. Everyone who owns more than 90 grams of gold must report it to the provincial government. Anyone who dares to hide it will be subject to a heavy fine equal to the amount hidden. Foreign currency transactions that took place between the 20th and 26th of this month must also be reported to the authorities within fourteen days from the date of implementation of this law.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 concerns various social welfare measures, divided into three items: (1) Workers' wages should be commensurate with the cost of living index. (2) The government may issue orders to adjust the salaries of civil servants. (3) Pensions for war veterans may also be adjusted by order.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 advocates that the government may reduce import tariffs on various essential foods, such as sugar, coffee, and coffee substitutes.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 advocates that the government provide 3,000,000,000,000 francs in loans to local administrative bodies, allowing local real estate banks to engage in mortgage lending.</p>
<p>Finance Committee Chairman Vanlian recently told people that the committee can pass the new currency bill within a few hours and complete its work tonight. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Franc Devaluation Results in Higher Cost of Living; Interior Minister Directs All Regions to Prevent Speculation and Profiteering</h3>
<p>(Paris) It is expected that the devaluation of the franc will increase the cost of living in France. Another result is that the government can obtain a very large profit due to the Bank of France's gold reserves being converted to the new franc value. If the government decides to devalue the franc by 30 percent, the amount obtained will be over £150 million. This money will be used to fund the exchange rate stabilization fund and compensate for losses and subsidies. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Interior Minister Salengro has telegraphed all regions of France, solemnly declaring that if the cost of living in various places suddenly rises improperly, the people's suffering will be unimaginable. He has ordered the local authorities to take strong measures to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking advantage of the current situation to speculate and profiteer. Those who disobey may be arrested and punished immediately. At the same time, according to Reuters' Bordeaux dispatch, although the Communist Party still opposes the franc's devaluation, it has decided to continue to vote in support of the government. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>French Government's New Measures; Majority in Parliament Agree</h3>
<p>(Paris) House Finance Committee Reporter Schmid (a member of the Radical Socialist Party) told a reporter from this newspaper, "I have always advocated for the devaluation of the franc, and I can agree with the new currency bill proposed by the government. I will submit a report to the House of Representatives tomorrow. What the French government is doing now can be compared to the currency devaluation policy implemented by Belgium in March of last year, except that France has formed a common front with Britain and the United States and has the support of twelve or thirteen other countries." (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) House Finance Committee Chairman Vanlian (a member of the Orthodox Socialist Party) told a reporter from this newspaper that he was satisfied with the establishment of a currency agreement between Britain, France, and the United States, saying that the universal stabilization of currencies in various countries and the economic recovery of France have begun, which is gratifying. "I hope that the current import quota system in various countries will soon disappear, and the current import tariffs can also be reduced, so that international trade can be expanded, and some of our country's industries that are currently being reorganized can also develop." In conclusion, he said that the House Finance Committee will approve the various measures taken by the government in the monetary field by a very large majority. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux, France Communist Party Secretary-General Dores recently stated that the party should actively support the new currency policy promoted by the Prime Minister, but demanded that a progressive wage rate be stipulated so that workers' wages can adapt to the rising cost of living.

<h3>Anglo-American-French Monetary Agreement Can Be Called a Historic Initiative; Promotes World Economic Recovery; Hopes to Achieve Political Appeasement</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum, on behalf of Finance Minister Olivar, recently met with reporters from various newspapers and gave a speech on the conclusion of the currency agreement between Britain, France, and the United States, stating that the governments of the three countries have simultaneously issued a public statement to world public opinion, indicating their determination to cooperate in restoring world economic relations to normal, in order to achieve material and political appeasement, and hope that other countries will work together to achieve this goal. This can be called a historic initiative, and its relationship is extremely important. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) Columbia University President and Chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Butler, recently gave a speech on the monetary agreement established between Britain, France, and the United States, calling it "the most important step to revive the world economy and consolidate world peace" since the establishment of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and also a consequence of the resolution passed at the 1933 London World Economic Conference on stabilizing currencies.

<h3>Switzerland Follows in France's Footsteps; Decides to Implement Devaluation</h3>
<p>Capital of Switzerland The Swiss government has decided to devalue its franc. According to today's public statement, the government is now paying close attention to the French government's proposal to Parliament to approve a 30 percent reduction in the value of the franc. It also states that the Swiss National Bank's position is solid, and its gold reserves are capable of coping with attacks on the Swiss franc for a long time. However, under environmental pressure, Switzerland's devaluation is inevitable sooner or later. Furthermore, the major powers are currently attempting to stabilize exchange rates. If Switzerland follows France, it will be able to take advantage of this attempt. Therefore, the government specifically decided to implement devaluation at noon today. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland After the news of the planned devaluation of the French franc was released, it became necessary to adjust the Swiss franc. After a four-hour meeting of the Swiss Federal Political Department, the necessary outline has been drafted and will be submitted to Parliament within a week.</p>
<p>After the Federal Political Council meeting, the following notice was issued: "After the French government resolved to reduce the value of the franc by 30 percent, the Swiss Federal Political Council believes that for the benefit of the Swiss national economy, it is necessary to adjust the Swiss currency to adapt to the world's major currency systems." (National dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Belgium Joins Agreement; Paris Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Commerce has instructed the remittance bureau to temporarily suspend payments and receipts regarding various measures of the new monetary policy until they are implemented. (Note: The remittance bureau is an agency that handles offsetting transactions between France and various countries.) In addition, Finance Minister Olivar told a reporter from this newspaper that the Belgian government has decided to join the Anglo-American-French currency agreement, which is greatly appreciated in France. It is expected that other countries will follow in Belgium's footsteps. Both houses of parliament are scheduled to present the various bills on the new currency policy for discussion at 9:00 AM on Monday (September 28th). (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Monetary Policy; Likely to Be Reconsidered</h3>
<p>(Rome) From the perspective of the Italians, Switzerland's decision to lower the value of its currency has greatly changed the situation in Europe's monetary system. It is widely believed that in order to cope with the reorganization of Europe's currencies, Italy may have to reconsider its determination not to lower the value of the lira. The Italian cabinet has scheduled an extraordinary meeting for Tuesday to discuss what plan the government should use to redetermine its fiscal policy. Responsible parties here welcome the international monetary agreement established by Britain, the United States, and France, as it can lead to the revival of international trade, and the currencies of various countries can be more equal as a result. The three countries have not yet asked Italy to join the agreement, but if they receive this request, Italy will study it in a spirit of cooperation. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the conclusion of a monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States, financial circles here are adopting a reserved attitude and making no comments. Although Italy is still one of the countries in the gold standard group, in reality, banknotes are no longer redeemable. The Bank of Italy has not published reports on its business situation for a long time, so no one knows what percentage the lira's reserves are. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Germany Maintains Calm Attitude; Does Not Want to Change Financial Policy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although responsible financial circles in Germany are dealing with the devaluation of the French franc calmly, the newspapers are greatly alarmed. The headlines they use to publish this news make readers feel that France will fall into financial and political panic. Here are a few examples to illustrate: "France's Serious Concerns," "The Great Disadvantages of the People's Front Have Been Discovered," "Wage Increases Have Now Reduced Their Value," and the like. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The devaluation of the French franc is specially recorded in newspapers here. Each newspaper has lengthy articles in its commentary and economics sections criticizing the importance of this strategy. The general opinion is that, given the difficulties of France's financial situation, the reorganization of the franc is an inevitable fact. Regarding the possibility of this strategy reflecting on the mark, the newspapers unanimously point out that Germany's economic situation is stable, and the devaluation of the franc may not cause Germany to change its current financial policy.</p>
<p>The "German Evening News" said, "We are in an observer position and hope that this difficult financial policy will be successful, because its failure will only increase the evil forces in Europe." It also adjusted Germany's stable economic situation, Schacht's plan, and the guarantees of the four-year plan announced in Nuremberg, as well as the orderly diplomatic and financial order, making Germany deeply feel that there is no need to change its policy. The "Berlin Trading News" said that the German economic community can take a calm and unhurried attitude towards the development of France's new strategy and its impact on the world economy. The newspaper also said, "Germany's devaluation of the franc has no direct impact due to the new plan and the overall system of foreign exchange and domestic currency." The newspaper finally said that the German authorities' calm attitude towards this new strategy can be seen in one thing: Central Bank President Dr. Schacht still had time on that day to participate in the economic conference in Saarbrücken.

<h3>Soviet Union Sells Gold Pounds; United States Purchases All of Them</h3>
<p>(New York) The Soviet Union sold one million pounds sterling in the market here yesterday, which was purchased in full by the US Treasury Department to avoid affecting the exchange market. The Anglo-American-French monetary agreement has already taken effect, as can be seen here. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the Soviet Russian government sold one million pounds sterling in the foreign exchange market, without any price limit, and it was purchased in full by the United States. Morgenthau also said that, based on the situation at the time, it was clear that someone wanted to depress the price of the pound. After a detailed investigation, it was learned that the Soviet Russian National Bank sold one million gold pounds without any price limit. The United States immediately purchased them in full with the balance fund. According to a country's government or a bank wanting to unilaterally and deliberately affect the US foreign exchange market, this is still an unprecedented initiative. The Treasury Secretary sincerely hopes that this kind of thing will not happen again in the future. Someone asked the Treasury Secretary why the Soviet Russian bank did this. The Treasury Secretary replied, "Only ask the Soviet Russian government." It is also unprecedented for the Treasury Department to announce this kind of news. At that time, the Treasury Secretary also urged reporters to publish it quickly before the market closed. (National dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that the United States purchased one million pounds sterling sold by the Soviet Russian government in the foreign exchange market today. The Treasury Secretary said that the new monetary agreement signed by Britain, the United States, and France is aimed at stabilizing finance and has now asked other countries to cooperate. However, this morning, he learned that someone was trying to depress the price of the pound. After inquiries, he learned that the Soviet Russian National Bank had ordered to sell one million pounds sterling at any price to see the best price. The Treasury Secretary told reporters that he would maintain the stability of the exchange of currencies between the United States, Britain, and France to the best of his ability, and was asked about the meaning of "to the best of his ability." The Treasury Secretary replied, "Two hundred million US dollars." The two hundred million US dollars is the amount of the exchange rate stabilization fund. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>US Acknowledges Franc Devaluation; Indeed Constructive</h3>
<p>(New York) Wall Street today welcomed the French devaluation plan and called it indeed constructive. Today, the world's major stock exchanges, including New York, opened. However, New York banks, like banks in major centers around the world such as London, suspended foreign exchange trading at the end of the week. Stock trading was quite brisk, with prices rising one to three pounds, because the French devaluation and the currency agreement between the three countries were beneficial to the multiple parties. Some traders advised caution, to see the effects of the franc's change more clearly, and to allow prevention of the return of foreign capital. But some also believe that the unstable financial situation has been resolved, so the good effects of overseas depreciation can be enjoyed for a long time, and it will be a step towards world recovery. Well-informed circles said that French funds would not suddenly return in large quantities. Brokers reported that the number of foreign trades today was relatively even. The anxiety caused by the pound in the morning subsided after Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued a statement. The large number of pounds sold by Soviet Russia was purchased by the US exchange rate stabilization fund. The price of cotton initially rose due to some purchases from Europe, then fell back due to some settlements, and then rose again due to foreign purchases. However, near closing, there were clearly arbitrageurs, and the closing price was quite stable, higher than the previous day's closing price by four to seven pounds. The Chicago wheat price initially rose due to factory purchases and frequent inquiries from abroad, then fell back somewhat. The closing price was the same as yesterday. The exchanges all believed that France's devaluation would ultimately benefit multiple parties. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>London Newspapers Comment; Important Step Toward Ceasefire</h3>
<p>(London) The French franc's devaluation was commented on by both yesterday's evening newspapers and today's morning newspapers. Among them, the "Star," the organ of the Liberal Party, stated, "Since the unfortunate demise of the World Economic Conference in 1933, the currency agreement signed by Britain, France, and the United States yesterday is the most satisfying thing. The Standard Evening News stated, "The exchange rate between the British and French currencies, which is usually 75 francs per pound, was not in line with the true value of the pound. Now that the franc has been devalued, its ratio to the pound can be closer to the actual value. The ratio of the US dollar to the franc was also previously below its true value." In addition, today's newspapers all stated that since the currencies of various countries can be universally stabilized in the future, domestic politics, economics, and commerce in France can also be improved in a short period of time. The root cause of world wars is actually economic warfare, which will inevitably disappear in the future. The Times' Sunday special edition stated, "Previous French cabinets have failed to balance the budget, so the financial situation is extremely unstable. When Blum came out and formed a cabinet, he had to resort to devaluation. The current issue is that the pound and gold are still not related, and how the exchange rate between them and the franc should be regulated. This exchange rate will probably be between 100 francs and 105 francs. Assuming that the exchange rate between France and Britain is 102 francs and the exchange rate between France and the United States is 21 francs, then the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar will be $4.866." (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Prospects for Economic Conference; Observations from Tokyo</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Netherlands also followed France's price reduction on the 27th and decided to ban the export of gold. As a result, the purely gold standard countries have now completely fallen in the world. The listening and acting of the countries will concentrate on the World Economic Conference. The current integration of the forecast from the Japanese Exchange Bank is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>In the future, countries around the world will use free currency to get rid of gold. As a result, the exchange rate market of each country is reflected in the integration of national power, and its currency relationship is first determined by the ratio, but it is upside down. Since the domestic and international realities have not yet been cleared up, and the issue of currency agreement is first put forward, even if the World Economic Conference is convened to conclude a currency agreement, no results can be obtained. Since the world currency is in a free relationship in the future, where should the position of the Japanese gold be placed? According to the observation of some people, it is believed that the Japanese Exchange Management Law has placed the Japanese gold in a higher position than the actual situation, and it is possible to re-examine and revise the Management Law. There is also this opinion, and this matter is noteworthy when the Ministry of Finance clearly expresses that its policy of 1 shilling and a few pence for British currency remains unchanged. (Allied Press dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>European Currency Fluctuations Affect the Brazilian Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Brazil: All currency transactions here, except for absolutely essential ones, have been temporarily suspended until Tuesday. It is generally believed that the impact of the franc devaluation may cause changes in the official listed exchange rate of the milreis (the gold coin of Portugal and Brazil). (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Yugoslavia Establish Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>(Rome) Since the implementation of sanctions, trade between Italy and Yugoslavia has ceased. After the sanctions were lifted, the two countries began negotiations to conclude a trade agreement. Negotiations were completed and the agreement signed last night. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3>How to Promote Rural Sidelines (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qian Tianhe, Deputy Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station</p>
<p>(C) Appropriate Raw Materials are Needed: The Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute in Wuxi has been promoting the weaving of grass carpets for several years. The weaving technology is no less than that of Guangdong goods, but its raw materials come from Hushu Pass in Suzhou. When dyed, the colors are not as uniform and attractive as the raw materials produced in Guangdong. Therefore, foreigners prefer to buy Guangdong goods rather than Wuxi goods. Another example is the Capital Experimental Public Education Center promoting rural sidelines by purchasing grass hat braids and teaching farmers to weave schoolbags and grass hats. However, because the grass hat braids are purchased from other places, even if the labor cost is low, the cost is already high due to transportation fees, and the price cannot be lower than that on the market, so sales cannot be promoted. Therefore, to promote sidelines, it is best to have appropriate raw materials locally, or at least buy them from outside at a low price and without worrying about a lack of supply.</p>
<p>(D) Make the Most of Local Natural Environment: Xia Shu Town in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, has several mountains nearby that produce clay for making sandstone jars, and pine trees, which are the best fuel for firing jars. This natural environment should be used as much as possible. On the one hand, efforts should be made to improve the technology of jar making and facilitate transportation; on the other hand, the existing jar kilns should be expanded and new kilns built to increase production. If the quality of the goods is good, transportation is convenient, and costs are reduced, the price can be lowered, and promotion will naturally be easier. Another example is the white stone (commonly known as Gaozi stone) in Gaozi Town near Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, which is very suitable for building expensive houses. If the railway bureau can reduce transportation costs, and the nearby farmers are willing to use their spare time to work hard, break the stones into suitable sizes of slabs or blocks, and transport them to other places for sale, they can surely profit. Therefore, to promote rural sidelines, it is necessary to make the most of the natural environment.</p>
<p>(2) Methods to Promote Rural Sidelines</p>
<p>(A) Government Support: In the past, the government rarely paid attention to or supported the operation of rural sidelines. It was completely left to the farmers to work hard on their own, without any policies, let alone organization. Everyone acted on their own, without any coordination. As a result, in recent years, affected by international economic forces, most sidelines have collapsed at the slightest sign of trouble. Therefore, if the government does not take measures to support them in the future, the failure of rural sidelines will be even more unimaginable. How to support them? It is nothing more than rewards, guidance, supervision, and control. The purpose of "rewards" is to promote them. For example, the paper umbrellas mentioned earlier were rarely sold abroad before, but now, due to the improvement of manufacturing technology, exports to the South Seas Islands are increasing day by day. At this initial stage of export, in addition to exempting all tariffs, the government should also use words to commend them in newspapers, or directly use material rewards. "Guidance" is about planning for farmers. Because the government is more familiar with the world situation and domestic conditions than farmers, it should plan for farmers which sidelines have hope, where to do which sidelines, and how to carry out which sidelines, and guide farmers to do them. "Supervision" is about making farmers make good use of their spare time and labor. For example, if the government determines that farmers in a certain area should take stone-breaking as a sideline, but not every farmer is diligent and obedient, so it must be supervised. If the products of sidelines are produced without any restrictions, it is easy to fail, so the government must "control" them. For example, if the sales of table felt are wide, order those who engage in table felt sidelines to accelerate production. If the pork market plummets and there is little hope of recovery in a short time, quickly notify those who engage in pig farming sidelines. This can avoid the drawbacks of supply exceeding demand or demand exceeding supply.</p>
<p>(B) Agricultural and Industrial Institutions Provide Technical Guidance: If the technology of such sidelines is not sophisticated, the products will certainly not be excellent, and sales will decline. Therefore, to develop a certain sideline, the technology of that sideline must be emphasized first. Then, to emphasize technology, do farmers have to hire technicians? This is certainly impossible. Then, should the government invite specialized personnel to go to various rural areas to provide guidance? There are many types of sidelines, and it is difficult to recruit specialized personnel for each item, and the country's economic strength is not enough. Therefore, the task of guidance can only be undertaken by agricultural and industrial institutions throughout the country. For example, many farmers near large cities take growing vegetables and fruits as a sideline, or even a main occupation, but they only know how to stick to the old methods. They do not know how to improve cultivation, nor can they organize sales. When they cannot sell their products, they do not know how to process them. In such places, local agricultural and industrial institutions should separately take on the task of guidance. Agricultural institutions should be responsible for guiding the improvement of cultivation methods, such as advancing the market, and organizing sales cooperatives to prevent merchants from monopolizing. Industrial institutions should be responsible for guiding the processing of fresh products that cannot be sold.</p>
<p>(C) The Industrial Sector Should Make Good Use of It: The current industry in our country, with the exception of a very few, still hovers between household industry and modernized industry. In other words, although some industries in our country have a modern appearance, their essence has not completely shed the spirit of household industry. Therefore, general factories should make good use of the surplus time and labor of farmers to do some work that does not require machines. Factories can buy them at low prices, and farmers are happy to do it because they have a reliable income, so both benefit. For example, grass whips are sold to foreign countries every year in large quantities, but the price is not high. Therefore, after foreigners buy them, they process them into various straw hats and sell them to countries around the world, and even transport them to our country and sell them at expensive prices, earning huge profits in one transaction. Why don't we weave grass hats ourselves and then process them into straw hats, etc., to sell to foreign countries and our own country? Wouldn't we be able to get a large income and block a huge outflow of money? Bleaching grass hat braids, weaving straw hats, etc., we have not failed to do in our country, but there are very few that can be called sales to foreign countries. If factories can especially weave straw hats in rural areas and then study bleaching and weaving methods, not only can they make Chinese people love to use them, but they can also be sold to foreign countries at low prices, which may be popular. Therefore, the industrial sector making good use of the surplus time and labor of farmers is one of the methods to promote rural sidelines.</p>
<p>(D) The Organization of Farmers: Farmers are at a disadvantage everywhere without organization, which is the main reason for the weakness of rural areas. Denmark is a small country in Europe. In the early 19th century, it was also despised and bullied like our country is now. Later, a Mr. Grundtvig, in view of the decline of the country, which was entirely due to the lack of organization of the people, began to abandon their comfortable lives with his followers from 1838, and painstakingly managed public schools to train and lead the people, so that the people were organized. For example, for purchasing agricultural tools and daily necessities, there are production and consumption cooperatives; for promoting agricultural products, there are marketing cooperatives; for saving and borrowing money, there are credit cooperatives. Almost everything is organized. Middlemen are completely prevented from interfering with things bought and sold. Moreover, after the farmers are organized, they generate great power. This power is the foundation for revitalizing the nation, developing civil rights, and solving people's livelihoods. Therefore, by the end of the 19th century, almost all the people in the country were rich, and the country was strong. Those who used to despise and bully him now dare not despise and bully him. From this, it can be seen that the organization of farmers—even the entire people—is more powerful than guns and bullets. I think we should make every effort to move in this direction. Recently, the government of our country has begun to attach importance to youth training. It is undeniable that this youth training is to organize the people. Although the training methods may be different, its purpose is to achieve the organization of the people. This is a good intention of the government for the revival of China, especially the majority of farmers, not only must accept, but also consciously and bravely come out to organize. This long paragraph seems to have nothing to do with promoting rural sidelines, but in fact, when the entire farmers are organized, there will be unlimited power. Rural sidelines can be worked hard under policy and organization. For example, to purchase raw materials, organize purchasing cooperatives; for daily consumption, organize consumption cooperatives; for transporting and selling products, organize marketing cooperatives; for circulating funds, organize credit cooperatives, etc. If there is foreign aggression, it can be resisted calmly. Under these circumstances, is there any reason why the promotion of rural sidelines will not succeed?</p>
<p>However, organizing farmers is not an easy task, especially to make the organization sound and powerful, which cannot be achieved in a short period of time. According to the statistics of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station at the end of the 24th year of the Republic of China, there are now 26,224 cooperatives of various types in our country, an increase of more than 11,000 cooperatives compared with the 23rd year of the Republic of China (see Agricultural Information Report, Volume 4, Issue 2). The number is quite impressive, but judging from its content, it can be said that 90% of them are not satisfactory, and they are passive. How can such a passive organization generate power? Therefore, it is very far from the purpose of the cooperative. Now, due to time constraints, I do not want to elaborate on the ways to organize farmers, but in short, if the government has the determination to organize farmers, the social people have the enthusiasm to support, and the farmers themselves have a thorough awareness, the organization of farmers will not worry about failure in a short period of time. After that, it will be easy to ask them to do anything, and it will not be a problem to promote rural sidelines. (End)</p>

<h3>Key Southern Fortress of Spain, Toledo, on the Verge of Falling; Rebel Army Advances Rapidly to the City; Siege of Alcazar Fortress Lifted</h3>
<p>Toledo: A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that the rebel army arrived outside the city at 6 PM yesterday. A column led by General Yague has encamped one kilometer from the city and will be able to enter the city at any moment. The rebels inside the Alcazar Palace have also been communicating with the rebel army outside the city, establishing contact. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Lagonia City, Northern Part: A radio station here just broadcast a message saying that the Nationalist army in the Alcazar Palace in Toledo, south of the capital, has been besieged and waiting for rescue for ten weeks. Troops under General Yague have recently attacked and entered the city, immediately repelling the government troops and lifting the siege of the Alcazar Palace. In addition, the Nationalist army attacking the port of Bilbao in the northwest, after fighting hand-to-hand with the government troops, has captured the city of Mondragon near the port. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: It was heard here today that the Valadouro radio station reported that the news that the right-wing army occupied Toledo and rescued the besieged cadets in the Alcazar Fortress has been confirmed. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Bilbao: The rebel army in Toledo Province is progressing very rapidly. The government army only resisted slightly beside the Tagus River, and blew up several bridges on the river, and then retreated. The rebel army attacked the high ground outside Toledo City at the afternoon of yesterday. The outposts are no more than seven kilometers away from the city. It would be possible to attack the city today, but for the sake of caution, the attack will not be launched until dawn tomorrow. It is expected that the battle will be fierce, and the outcome will be quickly determined. The rebel army has now established its headquarters in the city of Dolores. Five foreign war correspondents are also in that area. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The rebel army on the southern front continues to make important progress, so the fall of Toledo, a fortress fifty miles southwest of Madrid, is imminent. General Varelas' troops crossed the Guadarrama River yesterday after one of the fiercest battles of the civil war and pursued Toledo. The river is only seven miles from the gates of Toledo and is the last natural defense of the Castilian plain. The government army blew up the bridges along the highway during the retreat in an attempt to prevent the rebel army from advancing. Unexpectedly, the rebel army crossed the shallow water at night under a hail of bullets, forcing the government army to abandon the first line of defense on the low hills by the river and retreat. The southern army then advanced slowly along the smooth and yellowing plain. At dawn today, its outposts had reached a point less than two miles from the city and could see the sun rising from the Alcazar Fortress. At this point, everyone knew that the bloody battle along the Tagus River was nearing its end. The fortress has been besieged for nearly ten weeks, and the desire for rescue is very urgent. Now that the army can see the fortress, its excitement can be imagined. It is expected that the brave comrades remaining in the fortress will eventually be rescued in time and reunite with the army. The rebel army, from generals to foreign troops and volunteers, has a feeling of driving straight in and being unstoppable.</p>
<p>The air force played a very important role in the fierce battle at the Guadarrama bridgehead yesterday. Aircraft on both sides fought in the sky above the front line, corresponding to the land artillery and machine guns. The scene was extremely tragic. Several government aircraft took off from Madrid and Toledo, determined to prevent General Franco's troops from advancing. They encountered five rebel army bombers and nine fighters in the middle and tried to escape. One Douglas bomber was shot down at a location four miles south of Dolores. A Bréguet aircraft crashed and was destroyed outside the government army's line.</p>
<p>Yesterday, General Franco's mechanized column advanced eight miles towards Toledo without encountering resistance from the government army. However, when it reached the Guadarrama River, the enemy suddenly began to bombard the column with twelve machine guns. The rebel commander, Colonel Castillon, immediately ordered his troops to deploy and attack the small village of Villamena, four miles east of the enemy's position, with the strongest column, and another detachment to outflank and attack the right wing of the enemy army. The government army was shocked and quickly crossed the Guadarrama River and retreated, blowing up the bridge to prevent the rebel army from advancing. Although there was heavy rain last night, the rebel army still secretly waded across the river on foot. By early this morning, a column of Moors and foreign troops had reached a point less than two miles from the city. The rebel army continued to attack bravely this morning. By 10:30 AM, the streets of Toledo could be seen clearly. According to military experts, the government army has not made preparations to deal with the enemy's fierce attack, so the city can be captured in an instant. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

Houses around the city's station and city hall have been hit and caught fire. Many residents have been tragically bombed to death. The people's panic is indescribable. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>Eden's Remarks; Czech Reaction; Believe He Wants to Win Favor with Germany; Army Chief of Staff Visits Paris</h3>
<p>Czech Capital: British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the League of Nations on the 25th of this month, involving Article 19 of the Covenant, roughly stating that according to this provision, the current state of the world is not immutable. (Note: Article 19 stipulates that the General Assembly of the League of Nations may at any time ask the member states to review treaties that are no longer applicable and to consider international situations that could endanger world peace.) Czech political figures commented that Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks were intended to please Germany, which we understand, but we are afraid that those who want to revise the peace treaty will relive old dreams and take some action, which is very different from the proposal of Foreign Secretary Eden to peacefully revise the current treaty.

<h3>Simon's Speech; Supports Democracy; Denounces Dictatorial Systems</h3>
<p>(London) Home Secretary Simon delivered a speech to the National Liberal Party in Peebles today, warning those who promote the dictatorship system, saying that the Communist Party is now promoting communism and the Fascist Party is promoting fascism. They are all arbitrarily provoking others and causing the police a lot of trouble. The intentions of the two are the same, both wanting to overthrow the democratic autonomy and replace it with one or another kind of dictatorship. Both seek to control those they dislike. The first thing that can be observed about communism and fascism is that both are foreign products. Simon then asked, "Who in this free country can be a dictator?" Simon continued that no matter whether the dictatorship is communist or fascist, one thing is certain: it will require a dictator or a country of dictators. We have not started a war with other countries for adopting communism or fascism, but it is a clear fact that communism and fascism are both opposed to democratic autonomy. We have seen volcanic eruptions and riots occurring elsewhere due to the conflicts between the two ideologies, so we will never give any encouragement to any of them here. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<h3>New Road from Berlin to Breslau Completed; Hitler Presides over Opening Ceremony; Four-Year Economic Plan Implemented</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The road from Berlin to Breslau, a total of ninety-one kilometers in length, has been completed. (Note: Germany currently has a total of 60,000 kilometers of roads, of which 1,000 kilometers have been built since the National Socialist Party came to power.) Führer Hitler presided over the opening ceremony this morning and delivered a speech, saying, "Our country's four-year economic plan has now begun to be implemented. It is expected that after eighteen months, we will no longer need to purchase crude oil from abroad. After four years, all problems related to the manufacture of automobiles and tires can also be solved. At a time when financial resources are weak and raw materials are scarce, all national forces must be concentrated, and it is difficult to promote a democratic system. If Germany had colonies and sufficient raw materials, and its population was not as large as it is today, then there would be room for adopting a democratic system." (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3>Situation of Post-War Settlement in Guangxi Province: Troops Concentrated in Liuzhou and Yulin for Reorganization; Student Soldiers Placed and Rewarded; Political System Slightly Changed; Provincial Capital Moved to Guilin</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Li Zongren returned to Guangxi after meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in Guangzhou, he and Bai Chongxi have thoroughly discussed the post-war settlement of Guangxi's military and political affairs. On the 22nd, they convened a military and political conference in Nanning to discuss military and political reforms. Present were Li, Bai, and the Guangxi Army commanders, division commanders, militia commanders, and provincial government members, totaling dozens of people. Regarding the reorganization of the army, it is said that the Guangxi 7th and 15th Armies will retain their names, each army commanding three divisions, for a total of six divisions and eighteen regiments. The newly established 8th and 9th Armies will be abolished, and their troops will be assigned to the 7th and 15th Armies to fill vacancies. Disbanded officers will enter the Guangxi Military Academy for training, and disbanded soldiers will be assigned to military reclamation areas to engage in land reclamation. As for the disposition of Cai Tingkai's troops, it is said that they will still be organized into an army, commanding the troops of Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Zhaochen, directly under the command of the 5th Route Army. Another version is that Weng Zhaoyuan's troops will still be organized into an independent division and merged into the Guangxi Army. The commanders of the various armies will still be Xia Wei, Liao Lei, and others, and the division commanders will still be Wang Zanbin, Zhou Zuhuang, Qin Lianfang, Su Zuxin, He Weizhen, Weng Zhaoyuan, and Qiu Zhaochen. The 5th Route Army Commander-in-Chief, Li Zongren, will request the Central Government to appoint them. The new organization will be established on October 1st. Currently, the Guangxi Army units have been concentrated in Liuzhou for reorganization, with Bai Chongxi presiding over the process in Liuzhou. The troops of Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Zhaochen have retreated to the Yulin area for reorganization, with Cai Tingkai presiding over the process. Cai traveled from Yulin to Wuzhou on the 23rd to visit Li Jishen to discuss important matters and report on the reorganization of his old troops. After Bai Chongxi completes the demobilization of troops in Liuzhou, he will depart for Guilin at the end of the month to inspect the militia. When the Guangxi provincial military administration took over, student soldiers throughout the province who had received military training participated in the service. Now that peace has been achieved, they should be discharged to resume their studies. Those who aspire to pursue further military studies, those who have graduated or are studying at senior high school or vocational school, and those who have graduated from junior high school, are allowed to apply for the 8th term of the military academy. They are designated to gather in Yulin, Nanning, Xunzhou, and other places to await the preliminary examination. Their travel expenses will be paid according to the travel allowance for elementary school staff on business trips. Those who do not wish to apply or do not meet the eligibility requirements will also be given travel expenses according to the regulations for business trips and will be sent back to their hometowns. The travel expenses will be advanced by the various units and reimbursed later. Student soldiers who aspire to further their education will be given special preferential treatment. Junior high school graduates will be allowed to enter senior high school without examination, and senior high school graduates will be allowed to enter Guangxi University without examination, but both are limited to the current academic year.

It is said that there will be slight reforms in the political system, with the abolition of the Construction Commission and the restoration of the Construction Office. The location of the provincial capital will be moved to Guilin. It is said that this proposal was made by Li Zongren and was approved at the Nanning conference. It was also decided that military agencies would move first, followed by civil administration agencies. The Nanning Provincial Government compound will be converted into Guangxi University school buildings. (September 26)</p>
<h3>Amidst the Southward Advance Policy of the Japanese, the South Manchuria Railway's Influence Penetrates Fujian: Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Survey Iron Ore Mines, They Actively Operate in Three Shifts; the Intention to Build a Railway by Surveying Xiamen Bay is Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Fuzhou News: In October of last year, in order to develop the mineral resources of Fujian Province, the Fujian Provincial Government specially hired technicians from the South Manchuria Railway Company of Japan to conduct surveys in the Anxi Pantian area of southern Fujian. According to the authorities, this move was purely for technical reliance and did not infringe upon sovereignty in any way. The technicians sent by the South Manchuria Railway, in addition to setting up an office in Pantian to survey the Anxi iron ore, also planned to build the Southern Fujian Railway. After several investigations and surveys, it was temporarily suspended due to local unrest, rampant bandits, and various other reasons. The machinery was stored in Gulangyu in preparation for resuming work in April of the following year. We firmly believe in the sincere efforts of the Fujian Provincial Government to safeguard sovereignty, but we cannot but pay attention to the crisis of the South Manchuria Railway's influence taking this opportunity to extend into the entire Fujian. Therefore, the following is an overview of the company's personnel entering Fujian and their work, in order to arouse the attention of those who care about national defense in South China.</p>
<p>It is found that the South Manchuria Railway sent a total of twenty people, including Kijuro Nakagawa and Takeo Itamoto, to Fujian Province to conduct mineral surveys. They arrived in Fujian in October of last year. Among them, apart from Kijuro Nakagawa, who is a staff member of the South Manchuria Railway, there are also five people who are not technicians. For example, Sikichi Hatami and Tadashi Ikeno are staff members of the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen, Fuyama is a naval lieutenant colonel and aviation officer, and Banzō Isohata and Hideo Soma are also figures in the Japanese Navy. The intention of sending non-technical personnel to survey mineral resources can be understood without saying.</p>
<p>The Japanese who surveyed the Anxi iron ore were divided into three shifts. The first was the harbor shift. This shift, led by Hideo Soma, began surveying the coastal harbors of Xiamen as soon as they arrived in Xiamen. Then, from the mouth of the Jiulong River, they surveyed the Jiangdong Bridge in Zhangzhou to the source. The counties in southern Fujian that they passed through were Longxi, Zhangtai, Hua'an, Zhangping, and then into Anxi to survey the Lanxi stream. Apart from completing the survey of Lanxi and the Xiamen coast, they only surveyed a section of the Jiulong River due to strong opposition from the people of various counties. However, the fortress harbor of Xiamen Island has been surveyed in detail. Xiamen is only separated from Taiwan by a strip of water and is also close to the islands under Japanese administration. Internally, it can control various coastal areas of South China, and externally, it can be used as a base for invading the Nanyang Islands. From this, it can be seen that the task of the so-called harbor shift is of great importance. The second is the railway shift. The planned Southern Fujian Railway line starts from Pantian in Anxi, passes through Zhangping, Hua'an, Zhangtai, Longxi, and reaches Chongyu for shipping. The total length of the line is 350 Chinese miles. Originally, if the line were changed to run from Jimei in Tongan to Pantian in Anxi, the total length of the line would be 200 Chinese miles. Not only would the line be shortened by one-third, but also the intermediate route would be flat and avoid the high mountains and steep slopes, eliminating the need for tunnel construction and aerial cableway projects. However, the Japanese plan does not stop there. They not only covet the Anxi iron ore, but also want to conveniently mine the famous smokeless coal in Longyan, a neighboring county of Zhangping, and attempt to extend the line at both ends, one side extending into Guangdong Province and the other traversing the upper reaches of Fujian into Jiangxi to connect with the Nantao Railway, connecting with the recently established Guangdong-Hankou Railway by the British, extending into central China. The third is the ore survey and test drilling shift. In addition to surveying Pantian, this shift also incidentally investigated the nearby mines. The Pantian iron ore is located in the northwest of Anxi County, 15 Chinese miles from the county seat. The mountain is 300 feet above sea level, and the mining area is 10 Chinese miles in circumference. The ore is an open-pit iron ore, and the exposed bedrock on the mountain is the ore vein. The composition of the ore vein is up to 90% at the highest and 55% at the lowest. There is mostly magnetite, followed by hematite, and not much pyrite. Local people have been mining this ore since the Song Dynasty, smelting it using local methods, and selling it in the market. However, after a long time, only a small amount has been mined, and there are still 400 million tons left. At a value of 15 yuan per ton, the total is 6 billion yuan. In addition, there are many mineral resources within a radius of 50 or 60 miles, such as the lead mine in Nanyang, which is also of good quality and has reserves of 10 million tons. A local capitalist has organized a company to mine it, and the ore is sold to foreign merchants in Hong Kong for making pencils. Nearby, the Zhenqi iron ore in the southwest, and the sulfur, copper, and coal mines near Gaoping, also have abundant reserves. However, after the South Manchuria Railway's influence penetrates, whether this great resource will still be ours is a big question.</p>

<p>Li Zhaohuan's Speech Our society is one of the earliest established academic organizations in the country, and it is an honor to host the thirteenth annual meeting today. I would like to extend a welcome on behalf of the board of directors and, in my capacity as president of the National Association of the Chinese Christian YMCA, representing the association, to all of you who have graced us with your presence at this memorial hall. We are delighted to be participating in this conference and will be committed to working together to ensure the success of this meeting. I firmly believe that this conference will make a significant contribution to the world's economic thought and to our government's economic construction. The topic presented for discussion at this session is a central economic issue that the people of our country should pay attention to at this critical moment of survival. Because of the different starting points, opinions may vary, but we have the freedom to convene to serve the country as our greatest endeavor. I am also convinced that everyone's thoughts are pure and that we share common ideals. Our country is in such a perilous state, and I believe that the current economic situation in our country has become a problem, not only because of the current national crisis but also because of the fact that our economy is far behind other countries. The world has advanced to the long-awaited age of electricity. Looking at our neighbors, almost all of them have achieved a high degree of electrification. Their progress in engineering knowledge and chemistry is also far beyond what we can imagine. They are committed to militarism, so it seems that they can become strong countries without question. However, militarism is a product that is against international justice, and nationalism is both an element of industrialism and a product of it. Moreover, industrialism can make the progress of other countries rapid and easy. Looking back at our country, it is inevitable to raise the question, "Where is China's industrialism?" It can be said that our country is still in the early stages of industrial development. The area where coal is used is limited, and mineral oil all comes from foreign countries, and only a very small part of it is used for production. As far as we know, the few iron mines are almost all beyond our reach. The majority of our people are still engaged in agriculture, and they still stick to the old methods. The quantity produced is not enough to meet the needs of the people across the country. As for how to improve our living conditions, that is, to produce or import the goods we need, but now most of what we use is imported, and even the tools needed for production rely on imports. Not only the manufacturing industry needs such imports, but also agriculture, forestry, mining, and other industries. In the commercial ports, there are also new-style industries, but most of them are owned and operated by foreigners. Our transportation is very inconvenient. Taking what we have now as an example, let alone the quality, just asking about the organization and quantity, it is at least twenty years behind. As for the workers, this is what we often boast about. Their diligence, patience, loyalty, and bravery may not be matched by people from other countries, but their physical fitness is also poor. Speaking of intelligence, it is not enough to apply the latest scientific management. Speaking of physical strength, they cannot produce strong and promising children. The arable land in our country is not enough for ordinary needs, and large-scale new-style agricultural, mining, and manufacturing industries also lack sufficient capital. How sad and worrying is this economic situation! However, we are in it every day, and we still have not found the best way. At the same time, we can also see that the economic problems we encounter are very different from those encountered by our neighbors. If we use a simple and universally recognized sentence to explain the above situation, then our main and urgent economic problem is the problem of production, that is, from an insufficient social economy to obtain a surplus social economy. Therefore, what we must always understand and urgently solve is what goods, what methods, what time, what place, what capital, and what labor to use to produce for whom. We must understand that the current serious period is a necessary condition for considering the current problem. In fact, our problem is a product of the past and has reached its peak after a long struggle. We should examine the past experience and carefully examine the laziness, ignorance, negligence, shallowness, hypocrisy, cowardice, disloyalty, ineffectiveness, and other faults of the responsible persons of our previous two generations to make effective corrections and preventions. Whether our country's political crisis or economic crisis is the cause or the effect, and whether the current national crisis or the political and economic crisis is the cause or the effect, although there are many disputes, there is no consensus. But now the political and economic crisis is really caused by past mistakes, which cannot be denied. Good politics and a good economy are mutually reinforcing. Bad politics can involve a bad economy, and a bad economy can also affect politics. We now see a lot that can prove it, and there is no need to elaborate. Therefore, I mean that when we discuss, we cannot underestimate the indications of current and past experience. Conversely, or if we observe the problems we have with the eyes of a strong country on one side and the eyes of another strong country on the other side, and then, based on that kind of vision, we establish a solution, then, regardless of our country's own situation, leaving our nation's own position, imitating if it is inappropriate, the danger is even greater. Therefore, we must have definite views and how to establish arguments. We should know others and emphasize our own experience. In this way, we can know the importance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The Three People's Principles, as advocated by Mr. Zhongshan, are the crystallization of the integration of knowledge and have a lot of practical and theoretical value. This can be used as a guide for us in research and discussion. We should know that the normal solution of all current problems has a profound relationship with the psychological attitude of a group of people and policy issues. At this critical moment, there are still many people holding reactionary psychology, destructive psychology, inferior psychology, reclusive psychology, ignorant psychology, or bandit psychology, which is the same as when the revolution was launched 25 years ago. Therefore, some people now have partisan colors in their thoughts and actions, and they regard the country and the government as things they want to grab. Some people only know there is one family or, at most, one village, but they don't know there is a country. Some people don't believe that the individuals or groups of our nation can achieve greater and better achievements than Europeans. Some people feel the pressure of the enemy or the seriousness of our own responsibilities and become passive, cowardly, submissive, and desperate. There are even more people who are conservative and think they are cautious and unwilling to accept any new ideas and things. If the people of a country are like this, then no matter how practical and perfect the national economic construction plan is, it will not succeed. Therefore, when studying and discussing solutions, we should guard against ourselves and pay attention to others, and we must not be conquered by private forces or prejudices. In the past two or thirty years, we still have a big shortcoming, that is, we don't know who can really understand and is willing to work hard to achieve the goals that our nation must achieve. We sometimes ask what will happen to China in the future, or where should the Chinese people lead to? Furthermore, we ask whether China should be a capitalist or a socialist country? Sometimes we also acknowledge that Sun Yat-sen's teachings should be promoted throughout the country, but when economic policies become personal or social issues, there are very few people who consider this. Our education, family, or other private relationships and backgrounds are often on our minds. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, we often don't have a clear direction for the current economic problems. Even if we do, it is for one person, one province, or one region, but not for the whole country. Therefore, unless we can understand the current situation and understand the future trend, and jointly define and abide by a national policy, then the two words "national crisis" or "emergency" will not be meaningless and will only become an empty term. What we are discussing here may not be entirely concrete, but it must be related to the agricultural, mining, industrial, commercial, transportation, financial, and banking economic policies that our country should adopt. These various economic activities and the current difficulties are really intertwined. Therefore, our discussion must follow certain steps. Everyone's views may be different, and because of the limited time, we cannot discuss them thoroughly and in detail, but I sincerely hope that this conference can reach some conclusions, at least to arouse further research.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Speech He Yuanming, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said: Today is the 13th annual meeting of your society. The members of your society are all experts, industrial and commercial giants, and contemporary celebrities in our country. This conference is also being held at a time when the country is facing a serious crisis, the people's livelihood is declining, and the national economic construction movement is being vigorously promoted. This is not only because the people of China hope that the members of your society will contribute their wisdom and make plans to help the government overcome the difficulties, but also because our government hopes that the members of your society will express their opinions and make plans to help the government overcome the difficulties. I am here today on behalf of the Municipal Party Headquarters to meet with the members of your society and listen to your grand views and insights. I feel very honored and excited. I am an uneducated person, and if I were to express my opinions to you, I would feel ashamed, but for the sake of my duties, I feel that I have to say a few words to you. Now I feel that the evolution of the international situation and the tension in the relationship with China should be noted by your society, and you should raise the spirit of the whole country to study the first point, that China is currently in an extremely dangerous and deteriorating environment. The powerful neighbors are advancing day by day, and China is in danger day by day. During this period, if we don't have effective measures to deal with this crisis, we can only sit back and watch China be swallowed by the powerful neighbors and watch the Chinese people be oppressed by the enemy. There are certainly many strategies to deal with this crisis, but the most effective ones are the economic and financial problems in times of emergency. I hope that you will fully study these problems, make concrete plans, and provide them to the government for adoption and implementation to overcome the national crisis together. This is my first hope for the members of your society. Second, the National Economic Construction Movement is an economic policy implementation outline for the central government to realize the principle of people's livelihood. The general meeting and the local branch meetings have been established as resolved. This movement is undoubtedly a movement to relieve the suffering of the people across the country and is also a backbone movement in the national revival movement. I think you all understand the importance of this movement, so I and the economic experts in Shanghai also initiated the organization of an Economic Construction Association in order to provide the results of research for the government to adopt. I think the members of your society are all economic experts and practitioners. The situation of people's livelihood and suffering in various places is certainly very clear and thorough. I hope that you can uphold the concept of "worrying about the world before others worry and enjoying the world after others enjoy" and use the academic research you have gained in peacetime to assist the government and guide the people so that the National Economic Construction Movement can be easily promoted and quickly effective. This is my second hope for the members of your society. Third, our country has been poisoned by thousands of years of autocratic politics and has developed the bad habit of "not planning its politics if it is not in its position". People generally believe that the country's decision-making is the duty of politicians, and they feel that the people's opinions have no influence. Although this trend has gradually changed since the Republic of China, it is still far from the extent that the policies of countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan are mainly based on the suggestions of scholars. The reason for this is that the past government did not pay much attention to the contribution of the academic community, but on the other hand, Chinese scholars prefer to make empty and beautiful remarks, and it is not easy to see practical and feasible opinions. It cannot be said that Chinese scholars cannot bear a little responsibility. For the sake of economic transformation and national revival, I hope that the members of your society will pay more attention to the actual problems in front of you, plan carefully, make appropriate and feasible countermeasures based on China's actual situation, and provide them for the government to adopt. This is my third hope for you. My opinions are these three hopes. I hope that the members of your society will correct them without being polite and wish your society progress and everyone healthy on behalf of the colleagues of the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Speech Chairman, guests, and members, I feel very gratified to participate in the 13th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society today. The purpose of the Chinese Kuomintang's efforts to carry out the revolution is to realize the Prime Minister's Principle of People's Livelihood, and what our country and nation should promote, improve, and develop at present is the economy. Today, I see that the topic of the paper of the Chinese Economic Society is very good. Unfortunately, I cannot participate in the annual meeting more and discuss it with you because of my official duties. However, this morning, when I met you in your hospital, I would like to offer a little meaning to everyone. The topic is "China's Economic Revival and the Mission of the Economic Society". Our country's backward production has a long history. Before we started trading with Europe and the United States, we Chinese could be said to be self-sufficient. However, since we started trading with Europe and the United States, our exports have only been cheap raw materials and miscellaneous grains, and our imports have been mostly industrial products with high value. Therefore, the harvest of our farmers' hard work all year round can only be exchanged for a small amount of foreign goods with exquisite manufacturing. As a result, the great poverty and small poverty have become a common phenomenon in the whole country. This is the fact for decades, and there is no need for us to avoid it. However, knowing honor and disgrace only comes after having enough food and clothing. Politics and education are not to be discussed when food and clothing are insufficient. In this state of national poverty, the only way is to develop industry and revive the economy. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has gradually engaged in this. Unfortunately, our country's industrial foundation has not yet been consolidated, and economic construction has not yet been completed, and this unprecedented world economic panic has invaded. From the commercial ports to the inland provinces, all have suffered from the impact of the panic, resulting in poor exports, which has led to a sharp drop in the market price of agricultural products. The fall in the price of agricultural products has led to the bankruptcy of rural areas. The industry and commerce and other industries have declined due to the poor exports and the bankruptcy of rural areas. In the face of this unprecedented economic panic situation, the government can hardly let nature take its course and wait for the automatic revival of the general industry. It can only observe the recent measures taken by countries around the world to deal with the panic, examine the actual situation of domestic economy and finance, and take decisive actions in order to get rid of the whirlpool of panic as soon as possible, relieve the people's suffering, and establish the foundation for economic revival. This is why the legal currency policy was implemented in November last year. Since the outbreak of the world economic panic, the relief policies of various countries have been different from the past. Initially, there were still some countries that adopted the previous countermeasures. In terms of finance and finance, they implemented austerity, and in terms of industry and prices, they adopted a laissez-faire attitude. This is the only countermeasure of the liberals to deal with economic panic. For decades, countries around the world have followed it unchanged, and many have been effective. However, it is not entirely true for this resolution panic. As a result of the implementation, the degree of panic has not only not been reduced, but has intensified. Therefore, it has changed its strategy and adopted a proactive countermeasure centered on currency reform. For trade, it first lowered the exchange rate and stabilized it at an appropriate standard in order to increase exports and reduce imports. For industry, it implemented control from the perspective of prices and trade associations. For finance, it reversed the austerity policy of the past and increased expenditures. If the income and expenditure are insufficient, it will issue public bonds to absorb people's capital for the country's economic construction, and at the same time, it can make people get interest, and on the other hand, it can increase people's purchasing power. For finance, it adopts a low-interest policy in order to revive the industry. The issuance of public bonds has already raised the prices considerably due to the lowering of the exchange rate, but it also prevents them from rising excessively, which hinders the development of export trade. For tariffs, it still uses the protection system to prevent the increase of imported goods. For exchange rates, it stabilizes them at an appropriate standard or even strictly manages and implements control. All of these are passively simplifying the relief of panic and actively reviving the economy. Today, when international economic cooperation cannot be fully realized and the national economy is increasingly rising, and if we want to get rid of the misfortune of economic panic and revive a country's economy, then the above-mentioned economic policies are worth paying attention to. Since the implementation of several countries, it has been effective, which proves that economic liberalism has obviously shaken, and controlled planned economy has gradually occupied an important position in the new era. Our country's economic environment is different from that of advanced European and American countries, and the degree of industrial development is also different. Therefore, our country's economic revival and policy cannot be imitated by foreign countries. For example, when the government implemented the legal currency policy last winter, there were some points that were similar to those of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, but its entire policy and the implementation goals and steps had unique features of our country. This is to consider the effective countermeasures that have been adopted by various countries and to examine the environment in which our country is located and prescribe the right medicine. Only then will there be such a fundamental reform. Therefore, if it is said that it is completely transformed from foreign current</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The policy is not allowed by the facts. If we observe from the old-fashioned liberal stance, it is even more difficult to understand the true meaning of the current economic policies of our country and countries around the world. In short, we strive for self-reliance in industry internally, prepare to accept international economic cooperation externally, and use the power of the state to promote the revival of the national economy. Therefore, in recent years, Chairman Jiang has repeatedly advocated national economic construction, and recently, national economic construction branches have been set up in the central government and various provinces and cities. This is also to seek the self-reliance of the national economy and industry under the condition that it does not hinder international economic coordination. In recent years, I have been entrusted by the central government to be responsible for the national finance, and I have been working hard to reduce the burden on the people and to balance the financial revenue and expenditure. Fortunately, with the support of all economic experts, I have gained the understanding of the general public. At this time of world economic panic, when the finances of all countries have huge deficits, our country's financial revenue and expenditure can still barely cope, which is gratifying. However, the mission of national financial administration is not only to strive for a balance of revenue and expenditure, but also to use financial currency and financial policies that are suitable for the national conditions to achieve the purpose of developing industry, reviving the economy, and solving the people's livelihood. The recent implementation of the legal currency policy and the reorganization of various public bonds are examples. However, the development of emerging things is often opposed by old theories, and the implementation of new policies is often hindered by old forces. This is a common phenomenon in countries around the world, not just in our country alone. Therefore, when the government implements new policies, it must first obtain the understanding of the general public, otherwise misunderstandings will arise and the effectiveness of the new policies will inevitably be reduced. Last winter, when the government reformed the currency system, there were still a few people who mistakenly inflated the currency and sensationalized, which is an example. Now the results have gradually become apparent, and the general public has gradually understood the government's painstaking efforts. Another example is the recently introduced income tax, which is the best tax system in various countries. The burden is fair and does not hinder the livelihood of the general public. Therefore, its implementation not only increases the national tax revenue, but also has the supreme principle of preventing the gap between the rich and the poor from being too large and realizing economic control of capital. For example, those who earn 30 to 60 yuan a month pay 5% tax for every ten yuan, which does not hinder their livelihood. On the side of the taxpayers, it can make them develop good tax-paying habits. Therefore, I hope that the colleagues of your association will publicize this good tax so that the Chinese people can have a deep understanding. However, there are still a few people who think that the government is implementing a new tax, which increases the burden on the people. This is actually because they do not know the tax system of various countries in the world recently and do not understand the principle of fair tax burden. Therefore, the implementation of new policies in economic and financial aspects must first obtain the understanding of the general public before they can be done with half the effort. However, in our country, the public education is not yet popular, and the people's economic knowledge is still very naive. If we want to make the general public gradually understand the financial currency and financial policies that are suitable for the new era, we still have to rely on you economic experts to devote yourselves to the popularization of economic knowledge after research. However, the scope of economics is very broad, and I hope that you will focus on your specialties and engage in the popularization and practicalization of economic knowledge so as to achieve the effect of the people and the government cooperating together. Then the future of our economic revival can still be done with half the effort. The Chinese Economic Society is the oldest and largest economic academic organization in our country. At this time when the whole country is striving for economic revival, it should shoulder this mission. This is what I sincerely hope. The current situation in China is very critical, especially with the economic decline and industrial backwardness. Under this situation, China's future is very dangerous, but I think God treats us Chinese very well. With China's abundant resources and large population, as long as everyone can be calm and modest, work hard and quickly, then China's economic construction will surely have hope of success, and the Prime Minister's Principle of People's Livelihood can be realized, and the Prime Minister's revolutionary cause can also be completed. This is what I encourage myself with, and I am willing to encourage each other with the colleagues of your association.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech: Ladies and gentlemen, the Chinese Economic Society is a well-respected academic organization in our country. The members of your society are either scholars or leaders from all walks of life. This annual meeting is held in Shanghai, which is really a great honor for our city. I, Tiecheng, am the host, and I also feel honored. However, I was invited by the president of your society to attend and give a speech, which is really like showing off my skills in front of a master. Now, I will take advantage of this grand meeting to make a few humble opinions. I hope that you high-minded people can correct me. We have a broad view of human history, which is full of the facts of human survival. The society is constantly evolving, and human beings are constantly seeking survival. Social relations are becoming more and more complex, and human survival requirements are also increasing day by day. From this historical evolution phenomenon, the economy is certainly not the only element of social life, but it cannot be said that it is a powerful element, and its actual power to influence social organization and political system is truly significant. From the perspective of Chinese history, the leaders of the people in ancient times, such as Youchao taught the people to build houses, Suiren drilled wood to make fire, Fuxi made nets to catch fish, taught fishing and farming, Shennong made plows and taught farming, the Yellow Emperor made boats and cars, built palaces and houses, and Leizu taught the people to reel silk. The meaning of all these efforts is nothing more than to solve the people's actual survival problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and to satisfy the people's desire for economic life. It can be seen that the meaning of politics was originally for the people's livelihood, and it can be seen that the most important thing for the country is to solve the people's economic life problems. Youchao, Suiren, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor, they were able to be loved by the people and become the leaders of the people because they were able to recognize and complete the main work of the government, and were able to effectively relieve the economic suffering of the people at that time and increase the people's happiness in life. From the perspective of Western history, such as the political historian Hayes said that the implementation of democratic politics in Europe was first launched by the industrial revolution. The French political historian Sieyes said that the reason why modern European politics can evolve is entirely due to economic development, such as the progress of materials, the increase of population, the development of transportation, the rise of cities, the increase of wealth, and the development of capital. After the European War, the governments of various countries paid more attention to economic duties. In the writings of new progressive political scientists and in the articles of the new constitutions of various countries, the issues concerning the economic life of the people also occupy a more important position. From this, it can be seen that the intention of politics has always been inseparable from the economy. Abandoning the requirements of the people's livelihood will lose the meaning of politics. People in power, if they forget to work hard to satisfy the requirements of the people's livelihood, will lose the political opportunity and will not have the possibility of political evolution. Therefore, the Prime Minister, based on his great knowledge, always announced to the party members that "the people's livelihood is the center of history, and there is no need for revolution without the people's livelihood", and in the Great Program of National Construction, it is stipulated that the steps of national construction say that "the most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood", and we should jointly plan the development of agriculture to satisfy the people's food, jointly plan the development of weaving to enrich the people's clothing, and build various houses with a large plan to make the people happy, and repair roads and canals to facilitate the people's travel. Chairman Jiang deeply understands that the fundamental crisis of our country lies in the destruction of the national economy of the whole country. Therefore, on August 9 last year, he telegraphed the whole country in Chengdu, advocating the national economic movement. This movement is not only to complete the central work of our party's revolutionary construction, but also to lay the foundation for saving the people and building the country, because the survival and development of a nation must have two conditions, one is spiritual, that is, national consciousness, and the other is material, that is, a sound national economic foundation. From his own history, the King of Yue, Goujian, wanted to revive and strengthen the country. What he did was nothing more than two points: life and strict discipline. The latter is spiritual construction, and the former is material construction. From the perspective of foreign history, the prosperity of modern European countries is certainly influenced by the industrial revolution. Just like Soviet Russia after the revolution, its national strength can have extraordinary development, which is also the result of the whole country working hard on economic construction. What are the plans and strategies for economic construction? This is a specialized problem. In such a short period of time, Tiecheng does not want to express his opinions in a hurry, but from the historical precedents, any country's economic construction and development must first have its theoretical foundation. For example, the development of capitalism in the 19th century must first have the economic theories of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill. At first glance, scholars' theories seem to be irrelevant. If they penetrate into people's hearts and get the opportunity for systematic development, they will not only generate great potential, but also their actual impact on the economic life of the whole country will be beneficial or harmful, a blessing or a curse, and they are really important people. Since the Chinese revolution is different from the doctrines and environments of the revolutions in various countries, and China is now on the road of revolutionary construction, it is like a blank sheet of paper, which will be blue if dyed blue, and yellow if dyed yellow. What kind of country will it become in the future? It is really of great importance to the theoretical thoughts of today's scholars. At present, the thoughts of the people are still very divergent. Your society has great influence in the academic circles of our country. I am particularly raising this basic issue of national construction, hoping to gain many valuable lessons in this grand meeting. I wish you all good health, and I wish the conference success.</p>
<p>Afternoon Debate</p>
<p>The society held a debate yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA. The topic of the debate was "Should China's new financial policy prioritize foreign exchange stability or price stability?" The members of Group A who argued for foreign exchange stability were Liu Chuanshu (Ministry of Railways), Gan Shaode (Central Bank), Liang Qingchun (Zhejiang University), and Zhang Sumin (Jinan University). The members of Group B who argued for price stability were Chen Changheng (Military Supply School), Yao Qingsan (National Economic Research Institute), Zhang Jiaxiang (Central Political School), and Li Quanshi (Fudan University). All of them are well-known economists. Society members and guests from all walks of life actively participated, listening to both sides elaborate on their grand views. Chairman He Dekui first stated the purpose of the debate, and then the debaters from both groups spoke in order. Their eloquence was eloquent, and they expressed their opinions on the international situation and the current social environment of the country, as well as considering academic theories. The last two debaters from both sides, Professor Zhang Sumin and Professor Li Quanshi, spoke astonishingly, and the applause continued. The debate did not end until about 5:00 PM. The conclusion was that most people believed that the topic of this debate was originally two sides of one issue. It would be best if both prices and foreign exchange could be taken into account and stabilized at the same time. However, when both aspects seem to have serious situations, it is better to give up foreign exchange and stabilize prices in order to maintain social stability. According to the conference schedule, there was still a debate scheduled for this afternoon, but it has been temporarily notified to be canceled.</p>
<p>Public Banquet</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the society hosted all the members at the YMCA of Eight-lane Bridge at noon yesterday. Tang Qingzeng delivered a welcome speech, and Chen Qicai delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the members. At 7:00 PM last night, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industrial and commercial groups hosted a banquet for all the members at the Bankers' Club. The hosts who attended included Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilu, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Mu Ouchu, Kui Yanfang, Huang Renzhi from the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunqi, Pan Jiufen, Zhang Peishen from the Shanghai Municipal Bankers' Association, Cai Shengbai, Hu Xiyuan from the China General Confederation of Industry, Lu Shuchen, Zhang Mengzhou, Zhang Dapu from the Shanghai Money Industry Association, Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Wang Haifan, Xie Lin, Chen Xianmo from the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association, Shen Zhongyi, Feng Youxin, Lin Xisheng, Yu Zhiqing, Yuan Ludeng from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, Zhu Yangchen Xu Guanqun Wang Xingyao from the China National Products Production and Sales Association, Xiang Kangyuan Ren Shigang Lu Zhixue Ji Jiannan Cheng Shouzhong from the Federation of Factories Manufacturing National Products, and more than 120 members including Ma Yinchu Wu Xiaoyuan Zhou Zhongqian Li Yunliang Xu Sujun.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "Fellow members of the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society, today our association and other groups have prepared a simple banquet here to invite you to come and talk together. We are extremely pleased. Now I would like to tell you the purpose of this invitation banquet and the sincerity we hold, so as to elicit valuable opinions. How fortunate! I think that the situation our country is in today is a situation where it is difficult to take every step and throw away the big things. If a family encounters adversity, as brothers, we can only encourage each other to endure hardships. There is no reason to have drinking and feasting and compete for drunken satisfaction. Therefore, the meaning of inviting you to this day is not a common social exchange, but to encourage each other to save the country from its own position. What our country has been in for the past five years is a situation where we are sour and suffering, an experience that people have never had. However, among them, there are still things that are somewhat gratifying. In the academic organizations, there has been tireless progress that has never been seen before. This can be seen from the report of the annual meeting of the seven groups in the scientific community held in Beiping this year. The report said that the achievements of the academic community in our country in recent years can be said to be more than enough compared with the past, and it also said that "several kinds of academic research are no less inferior compared with the backward countries overseas." Zhuang Zhou has a saying, "Those who escape the empty valley are happy to hear the sound of human feet, let alone those who are surrounded by brothers and relatives." The people of the country have been full of grief and indignation for a long time. Hearing this good news, it is not only a feeling of hearing the sound of human feet in the empty valley. The report only pointed out that some natural sciences in our country have achieved considerable results, but our association believes that economists in our country can always express their accurate views and take on the heavy responsibility of guidance at this critical moment of the country, and their self-effectiveness for the country is definitely no less than that of natural scientists. For example, in recent years, the silver problem has almost made our country's financial institutions and financial lifeline destroyed without residue. Fortunately, economic researchers, at the time when there were different opinions, expressed their unique insights, advocated reforming the monetary policy, and rejected the private plan of currency inflation, so that the authorities could determine the direction and resolutely implement it. This is the initial step for scholars in our country to promote their authority in politics with theories, washing away the past criticisms that the son only has fallacies in theory. When the reform was first implemented, those who envied and jealous of us still said that it would inevitably fail, but now they cannot but admit that it has had considerable success. In the past, Zi Yu said, "It is not a disaster for the country if there are not many armors, but it is a disaster that there is no education for the people." It shows that the effect of scholars saving the country is far better than that of armors. This annual meeting of your society brings together the members in Shanghai, and there will be further contributions to lay the foundation for the national finance in normal times and to establish plans for the national finance in emergency times. The world is changing day by day, and scholars are paying more and</p>
<h3>Nanyang Inspection Group Arrives in Singapore (Continued) Joint Statement Released in Batavia Upon Departure Singapore Trade Fair to Open on the 16th</h3>
<p>Welcome in Singapore The "Francis" ship arrived in Singapore at 7 a.m. on the 14th, mooring at godown No. 20 in Tanjong Pagar. Shi, the acting Consul General of the Republic of China in Singapore, along with representatives from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Huang Manshi, Chen Yue, Wang Cuichen, Lin Jianbang, Ke Jinlai, Deng Bingren, Chen Dingming, Chen Shengping, reporters from various Singaporean newspapers including the Singapore Chinese, Xin Guomin, Zonghui, and Nanyang Shangbao, as well as representatives from Penang, including Hui Shengti and Luo Shisheng, boarded the ship to shake hands with each member of the delegation, expressing their welcome. They then disembarked and, along with the welcoming representatives, traveled by car to the Queen's Hotel.</p>
<p>Visiting Overseas Chinese Organizations Immediately after unloading their luggage and taking a brief rest, the entire delegation was led by representatives from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to visit various organizations, including the Consulate General, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Kuomintang branch, the Bank of China, the Overseas Chinese Bank, the Sze Hai Tong Bank, the Guangdong Association, the Fujian Association, and Tangyang Foreign Goods firms. They also visited Hu Wenhu, Chen Jiageng, and the chairman and directors of the Chamber of Commerce, Lin Wentian, Li Junchen, Li Zhendian, Ye Yidui, as well as various new organizations in Singapore, until after 1 p.m. when they returned to the hotel for lunch. At 4 p.m., all members of the delegation went to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to set up the exhibition venue.</p>
<p>Joint Statement The China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association, with the aim of expanding overseas trade and gaining insight into the current situation in Nanyang, organized the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group. After several months of preparation, it received encouragement from the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and departed from Shanghai on July 16th of this year, with a planned itinerary of three months, passing through Manila, Surabaya, Batavia, Singapore, Ipoh, and Siam. Later, due to the enthusiastic welcome from overseas Chinese communities in Medan, it was also decided to visit there. The group stayed in each place for a week or three weeks, displaying over a thousand samples of domestic goods from 37 Shanghai participating factories, aiming to allow all parties to understand the latest progress in domestic industrial products and to investigate the local situation as a basis for foreign trade. At the same time, they investigated the raw materials produced in various regions that were suitable for domestic needs, providing a reference for domestic procurement. However, due to various reasons, they were unable to collect all the famous domestic products and fine industrial products, which they deeply regretted. It was decided to hold the second National Goods Exhibition in Singapore in October, but due to time and itinerary constraints, the delegation was unable to participate at that time, which they felt was regrettable. Fortunately, the exhibition items brought by the delegation would be left in Singapore after the exhibition to establish a permanent National Goods Exhibition Hall, allowing Singapore to participate in the exhibition at that time. The delegation stayed for a week each in Manila and Surabaya and three weeks in Batavia, and were deeply grateful for the warm welcome and hospitality from the local consulates, chambers of commerce, and overseas Chinese communities, as well as the various conveniences provided, which allowed all work to proceed smoothly without any difficulties. Although they were in a foreign land, they felt as if they were in their own country, and the practical criticism and guidance regarding the methods of promoting domestic goods overseas, as well as the spirit of kinship and sincerity, were truly moving. Overseas Chinese businessmen actively contacted the delegation members to discuss agency and placed orders, demonstrating their enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods. What was most exciting for the delegation on this trip was that everywhere they went, they saw the flag of the Republic of China flying, as if they were within the borders of their own country, which showed the wide and dense distribution of overseas Chinese and gave the delegation much comfort. It is worth mentioning that the local governments and foreign import merchants in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies all expressed goodwill towards the delegation and praised the solid quality and excellent craftsmanship of domestic goods, expressing their willingness to assist in their promotion. The government authorities treated the delegation as state guests, waiving all entry procedures and hosting them with banquets, with ceremonies of welcome and farewell. This was due to the long-standing good relations between our country and these countries, as well as the credibility of our overseas Chinese who were active in various regions. In the Dutch territories, the import of foreign goods was strictly restricted. The delegation repeatedly contacted the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs to negotiate for national diplomacy, which yielded good results, obtaining a number of special import permits. The issue of importing Chinese goods in the future was also discussed, and it was agreed to improve the situation at an appropriate time to promote the prosperity of trade between China and the Netherlands. The delegation of twelve members arrived in Singapore yesterday morning and are deeply grateful for the welcome from the Consulate General, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and various overseas Chinese organizations. Singapore is the most important gateway to Nanyang and a gathering place for overseas Chinese. After more than a hundred years of hard work, they have achieved their current status. People in China have long admired the successful history of leaders in Singapore. They were pioneers in promoting domestic goods, giving them a foothold in Nanyang. The overseas Chinese in Singapore have made many contributions to government and social undertakings in China. Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Singapore have made the greatest contribution to the motherland. The delegation feels extremely happy to be in this environment. Furthermore, the delegation came to Nanyang knowing that Sino-British relations are friendly, and domestic manufacturers hope for even greater opportunities to promote trade between the two countries. On the one hand, they investigated the products of Singapore, such as rubber, tin, and pepper, hoping to purchase them as much as possible. On the other hand, they sought outlets for Chinese industrial products in Singapore. We firmly believe that the cooperation between the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Malaya and European merchants will undoubtedly promote trade between the two countries. The delegation plans to stay in Singapore for twelve days, holding a national goods exhibition and conducting on-site investigations. Tomorrow, the exhibition will be held under the guidance of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. What is displayed is only one-tenth of the domestic products, and we sincerely hope that the overseas Chinese will provide honest criticism during this period.</p>
<p>Tea Party Reception The evening after the delegation's arrival in Singapore, the Cuilan Pavilion Tangyang Foreign Goods firm hosted a grand tea party, inviting all members of the delegation to express their welcome. The Tangyang Foreign Goods firm is the general group of retailers in Singapore, with a long history and a keen interest in promoting domestic goods. At around 8 p.m., representatives from the firm arrived to greet them, and they took cars to the firm, shook hands with the firm members, and went upstairs to attend the meeting. The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Yi Duanyuan, who expressed his welcome and hoped for two things: (1) that overseas and domestic merchants should maintain close contact to develop domestic goods, and (2) that domestic goods manufacturers would continuously produce and promote goods in Nanyang. Then, the two leaders, Gao and Hu, reported on the mission to Nanyang, the journey along the way, the recent situation in the motherland, and the future steps for promoting domestic goods overseas, sincerely hoping for the guidance and assistance of overseas Chinese. The audience was moved. Finally, Wu Chengsi, the manager of the firm, reported on the nature of the firm, the organization of the foreign goods merchants, hoping to cooperate closely with the delegation and work together. Around 10 p.m., refreshments were served, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Venue Setup The exhibition venue was located on the upper floor of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. After two days of setup by the delegation members, the venue was dazzling and beautiful. A horizontal banner was erected at the entrance, shaped like a bucket, with the words "Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group National Goods Exhibition." Beautiful patterns were used on the left and right sides, which were very eye-catching. Various goods were displayed in exquisite glass showcases, categorized and clearly labeled. Being in the midst of it was like entering a department store.</p>
<p>Grand Opening On the 16th at 2 p.m., the opening ceremony was held, and the Chamber of Commerce hosted a tea party to welcome all members of the delegation. Over two hundred people attended the event. Chairman Lin Qingnian presided over the ceremony, and after the rituals, the chairman delivered an opening speech, expressing respect for the delegation's efforts to travel to Nanyang for inspection and bring over a thousand samples of domestic goods, praising their spirit of working hard for domestic goods. Then, Acting Consul General Shi delivered a speech, saying that to develop foreign trade, one must know oneself and one's enemy in order to be victorious in every battle. To operate a domestic goods business, one must concentrate the resources of many people and create a strict organization to achieve development and restore the nation's economic power. Finally, the delegation leader Gao Shiheng reported that the China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association, in view of the importance of international trade and the recent high development of domestic industry, should find a way out. Since the National Government promulgated the legal tender order, foreign exchange has been leveled, and the Bank of China has established a branch in Singapore, with branches also being planned in other parts of Nanyang. For the above reasons, it was decided to promote overseas trade, hence the organization of this delegation. Singapore has the most overseas Chinese, and the promotion of domestic goods has been effective, with the closest relationship with the motherland. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese surpasses that of the people in the country, and they have contributed greatly to the motherland. It is hoped that this spirit will assist the delegation in completing its important mission. He then discussed the past trade spirit between China and Malaya, suggesting that there is potential for greater prosperity. Finally, he thanked the overseas Chinese community in Singapore for their warm reception and welcome. After the speech, there was tea and photography. Finally, the wife of Acting Consul General Shi performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. As the military band played loudly and the ribbon was cut, the guests entered the building in an orderly fashion to view the exhibits. They all agreed that the products had made great progress and were able to compete with foreign goods.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Visitors After the opening of the exhibition, the number of visitors was unusually crowded for days. The area in front of the Chamber of Commerce was bustling with traffic, and the number of visitors each day was around two thousand. Male and female students went in groups to observe domestic goods, and their emotions were extremely excited. Many European and American men and women also lingered, praising the rapid progress of Chinese goods, their solid quality, and expressing their satisfaction. All delegation members and the Chamber of Commerce-appointed receptionists worked together to provide attentive service.</p>
<p>Various Receptions After the delegation's arrival in Singapore, various parties were busy with receptions. The Singapore Shanghai Bookstore, the Bank of China, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations held dinners to welcome them. It was reported that telegrams of welcome had been received from Siam, and Chen Shouming, Yi Xianyan, Xu Hemen, and others had initiated the organization of a preparatory committee in Thailand to welcome the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group from the motherland. Preparations had begun in Medan, and Qiu Zongting and Hua Wenying, members of the Medan Committee, had come to Singapore to express their welcome and discuss preparations. The delegation left Singapore for Penang on September 28th, where the exhibition was scheduled to be held in the Daguan Amusement Park, with the participation of local overseas Chinese engaged in domestic goods. The delegation was originally scheduled to return to China on October 16th, but due to the welcome telegrams from Medan, it was decided to go there for an exhibition, so the return date was in mid-November.</p>
<p>Remembering the Motherland On the 9/18 Anniversary, the delegation held a memorial ceremony at the hotel, led by delegation leader Gao. After three minutes of silence to commemorate the soldiers who died resisting the enemy and the compatriots who suffered in Northeast China, the ceremony was simple but deeply meaningful. The delegation was far from the motherland and deeply concerned about national affairs. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Wuxi Prepares to Establish a Fishery Association</h3>
<p>Since the preparations for the Wuxi Fishery Association began in 1932, they have been poorly managed, and County Magistrate Yan Shenyu ordered its dissolution in accordance with the instructions of the Construction Department and its reorganization. However, the matter has not yet been reported to the Department for verification. The Ministry of Industry believes that according to Article 1 of the Fishery Association Law, fishery workers should be the main body, and Article 5 of the same law is an exception. When people in various regions initiate the organization of fishery associations, the local administrative authorities are responsible for reviewing them. If the relevant supervisory authorities of the Fishery Association can truly supervise and guide according to the law, then the so-called abuses of the Fishery Association can be reduced. The Ministry hereby orders the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct the county magistrates to comply, promptly organize new fishery associations in accordance with the law, and establish them before the end of August of this year. After receiving the order, County Head Long immediately ordered the preparatory office of the County Farmers' Association to comply. Since the farmers' associations in various districts and townships have not yet been formally established, the new fishery association could not be organized as scheduled. Now that the deadline has passed and preparations are urgently needed, members have been dispatched to various places to investigate the personnel engaged in fishery and actively prepare for the establishment.</p>
<h3>Mutual Suspicion Between Old and New Police</h3>
<p>Since Zhang Da, the director of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, took office in August, he has assigned more than 180 police academy students from the provincial police academy to serve in various sub-bureaus. At the same time, he transferred old police officers to the province for training, which once triggered a serious wave of strikes. Although it was resolved through mediation by various Party and government circles, most of the old police officers still disagreed with the new police academy students, and they suspected each other. Disputes and conflicts arose frequently. In view of this, Director Zhang specifically ordered the directors of various sub-bureaus to earnestly persuade the old and new police officers to work together in harmony, unite sincerely, and serve the society loyally. They must not divide themselves and harbor prejudices, harming the local area and causing public criticism.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Elder Brother Kills Younger Brother</h3>
<p>Gu Asi, a villager in Huangqiao Township, District Six, is over sixty years old and has three sons: Jinquan, Jinming, and Puqing. Jinquan and Jinming are both married, while Jinqing is twenty-two years old and unmarried, living with his parents and earning a living by growing vegetables. He is considered filial to his parents. A few days ago, the Chen family, a neighbor, bought a large batch of wood and piled it on the threshing floor in front of their door. Believing it to be unlucky, Jinquan, whose father was suffering from carbuncles, resented the Chen family for piling up the wood and negotiated with them. His younger brother, Jinqing, mediated in order to resolve the matter peacefully, and the Chen family set off firecrackers. However, Jinquan was still resentful and shifted his anger to his younger brother. On the afternoon of the 25th, when Jinqing was setting off firecrackers on the threshing floor, Jinquan, holding a nail rake, ambushed Jinqing and struck him violently on the head, causing blood to spurt out. Jinqing fell to the ground immediately, barely breathing. His mother hired a boat to the city and sent him to Fuyin Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died last night. The murderer was taken into custody by Township Head Gu Junyi, and the county reported for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Yuyao Boat Owners Petition the Salt Affairs Administration for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Yuyao's field salt is sold in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, and is transported by sailing boats, commonly known as "brush boats." The freight income, after deducting various expenses, yields a meager profit. Only due to the sluggish market and the limited transportation of other goods, they have to endure hardship and transport salt for a living. In recent years, piracy has been rampant, and they have been robbed repeatedly. There have also been collisions with ships and hurricanes, etc. The livelihood of boat owners is already pitiful. Unexpectedly, this year, the Songjiang Audit Branch and the Songjiang Transport Deputy Office have strictly ordered salt merchants to pay taxes for boats that encounter disasters and lack jin, and those that are robbed. Merchants demand compensation from the boat owners, regardless of the facts. The boats are alarmed and have no way to appeal for justice. Boat owners in Yuyao have repeatedly held public meetings to discuss remedial measures. They all agreed to request Chief Zhu of the Audit Administration to exempt boats that lost salt due to natural disasters and robberies, which are beyond human control, from paying taxes in order to save their lives. A few days ago, they elected three representatives, Yuan Zuogao and Shen Yao, to come to Shanghai to petition Chief Zhu of the Salt Affairs Audit Administration. Director Feng met with them on behalf of Chief Zhu. After the representatives explained their intentions, Director Feng expressed his deep sympathy and promised to convey the message to the Chief. Director Feng also said that the responsibility for paying taxes should rest with the merchants and not with the boat owners. The representatives said that merchants often detained boats, causing not only great losses but also great suffering. Director Feng showed considerable dissatisfaction and promised to order the merchants not to detain boats in the future in order to protect the livelihoods of the people. As for the robbed boats, Director Feng promised to investigate the case immediately and exempt them from compensation first. As for piracy in the ocean, he also promised to set up patrols to suppress piracy. Yuan Zuo and others have now returned to Yuyao to report to the boat owners and will temporarily leave representatives in Shanghai to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Nantong Opium and Drug Cases Still Handled by the County</h3>
<p>Since July 1, opium and drug cases in Nantong have been directly tried by the District Security Command. However, it was felt that this was inappropriate, and District Commander Ge Tan reported to the Provincial Government for approval to return the handling of opium and drug cases to the County Government.</p>
<h3>Execution of Red Pill Traffickers</h3>
<p>The Nantong County Government cracked down on a drug den in Baipu and arrested two major criminals, Wu Diguang and Zhang Chengru, for manufacturing and trafficking red pills. The witnesses were also sent to the Fourth District Security Command for interrogation. After confirming the facts, they were sentenced to death. With the approval of the Military Commission, the two criminals were taken to the execution ground in the east of the city on the morning of the 16th and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Changshan Coal Mine to Be Exploited</h3>
<p>A coal mine was discovered in Chishanwu, Southern Changshan County. After an inspection by Zhang Jianyu, dispatched by the Construction Department, it was estimated to contain 250,000 metric tons of coal. After provincial testing, the coal quality was considered excellent. It was decided to mine it using local methods based on the most economical principles, and a loan of 10,000 yuan was obtained from the Zhejiang Local Bank as exploration capital, with an annual interest rate of 1%. The Provincial Government provided a guarantee, and both parties have agreed to sign a contract. Construction and mining will begin next month. For the convenience of command, an office will be established in the mining area, with Zhang Jianyu serving concurrently as director. All regulations are being drafted and will be submitted to the Department for approval. It is expected that the first month will produce 900 tons of coal. As the coal roads are widened and the number of coal workers increases, the output is expected to reach 3,000 tons per month after six months. It is planned to invite merchants to contract transportation and sales.</p>
<h3>Issuing Arrears to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, the Zhejiang Department of Finance noted that various agencies had accumulated arrears of funding for as many as three or four months. To cope with the urgent need, the Department of Finance dispatched personnel to strictly supervise the collection of new and old taxes for provincial use. However, there was still a significant shortfall. Therefore, part of the 4 million yuan borrowed from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Local Bank was used, totaling 600,000 yuan. Yesterday, a notice was issued to allocate one month's worth of arrears to various agencies, requiring them to collect it from the provincial treasury by the end of this month. The Mid-Autumn Festival financial agencies managed to get through with great effort.</p>
<h3>Liuhe Change of Head of the Opium Addiction Treatment Center</h3>
<p>Fan Yuanzheng, the director of the Liuhe Opium Addiction Treatment Center, has been in office for more than a year and has achieved good results. However, he recently received an order from the province to be transferred to another position in the province and was instructed to expedite the handover. Director Xia complied with the order and completed the handover. It is said that the vacant position of director has been filled by Ding Yinmei, a doctor at the treatment center.</p>
<h3>Mingguang Capital Court Investigates the Sun Case</h3>
<p>The Mingguang Chamber of Commerce reported that Sun Yanwu, the director of the Mingguang Station, extorted fees. After investigation, the Railway Bureau found that there was a basis for the report and transferred Sun and fourteen other staff members involved in the case to the Capital District Court for legal action. The court specially dispatched prosecutor Jin Fengao and a clerk to investigate the evidence.</p>

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited him specifically to inquire about this. Chu denied the rumor, saying that they are currently intensifying preparations for everything, urging the provinces to rush to submit candidates, and that the construction of the venue is nearing completion, hoping that it will be held as scheduled on November 12.</p>

<p>New Sound Society reports: The seemingly relaxed but internally tense situation in Zhabei. The Japanese Marines, concentrated at the Sixty-Three Garden and the Japanese Cemetery, were moved in the early morning to a large open space at the northern end of Zhuangjia Court at the end of Huayuan Street, He’s Residence at the corner of Hengye Road and London Road, and the old site of the Nanbao Glass Factory on Shuidian Road. There were no major changes yesterday after they set up camp there.</p>
<p>Crowded Beachfront Housing and Breweries</p>
<p>New Sound Society reporters conducted two investigations yesterday morning and evening and learned that it was difficult to count the number of Japanese soldiers in the area due to their constant coming and going. Last night, in addition to a portion of the support tents being exposed on the field, the majority were crowded at the southeastern edge of the field, adjacent to the Japanese-owned Tan’wu Brewery. Since early yesterday morning, numerous trucks continued to arrive and depart, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers. There were also cars continuously transporting coal cinders and burlap sacks. They remained stationed there until late at night without moving.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Post in the Concession</p>
<p>Japanese troops in the concession area concentrated in the Yongfeng Building near the Xingjia Bridge on North Sichuan Road from the day before yesterday. The building is a five-story mansion, rented by the Japanese military from a real estate company for 800 yuan per month, for a term of three months, to establish a branch defense post. In front of the building are stationed an armored vehicle and two motorcycles. The Japanese military patrols the concession, using this place as the center. When the reporter passed by the area at about 8 p.m. last night, the stationed armored vehicle had just departed and was patrolling the North Sichuan Road area. As for the stationed Japanese soldiers, it is reported that most of them were transferred from the Taoshan Dance Hall, with an additional reinforcement of more than 100 people from the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters on Jiangwan Road. They also store a large amount of military supplies.</p>
<p>Situation on All Roads Remains Peaceful</p>
<p>The situation on Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, Tiantong’an Road, Huanglu Road, Shuidian Road, Bazhi Bridge, Qingyun Road, Yokohama Road, and other places is the same as the day before yesterday, and remains peaceful. However, Japanese military trucks and patrol teams still come and go from time to time, but they do not stop or post guards. Five Japanese soldiers remain at the Japanese cemetery, keeping the gate closed. The Sixty-Three Garden is no longer seen Japanese soldiers. All Japanese soldiers have been withdrawn from the Taoshan Dance Hall. A small number remain at the Japanese elementary school. Armored vehicles are stationed at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, and at the intersection of Dixiwei Road and Qiujiang Road. The armored vehicle that was stationed in front of the United Machinery Factory on Dixiwei Road the night before last was gone yesterday. Three to five Japanese soldiers are still stationed at the site of the sniping incident against Japanese sailors on the right side of the Japanese Shanghai Bank at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road, but the ropes that were used to cordon off the area have been removed. Also, although it was Sunday yesterday, the intelligence department of the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road was still working, but it was as quiet as the day before, and no meetings were held.</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai from Beiping Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>The Society for the Promotion of Native Products is Working Hard</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Autumn Native Products Festival, all members of the Chinese Society for the Promotion of Native Products have been mobilized to promote native products. The impact of this movement has greatly helped the national livelihood. The Society notes that funeral elegiac couplets and propaganda slogans are mostly made from imported fabrics, which not only damages national pride but also results in a considerable outflow of money each year. In order to strengthen the foundation of the national economy, foreign fabrics should be replaced with domestic fabrics. Native cloth is cheap and durable, making it the most suitable for this purpose. Members of the Society and its affiliated organizations have been using it for a long time and find it very beneficial. Therefore, the Society is announcing to the public that they should unanimously promote this change. At the same time, they will guide village women to weave sufficient quantities of cloth to meet the demand. The Society also believes that wedding events are an excellent opportunity to promote the use of native products. All wedding invitations, clothing, bedding, banquets, tea, fruits, snacks, and dowries can be made from native products, which are both economical and durable. They hope that leaders in various regions will take the lead in promoting this change. The Society has also learned that the Zhuanqiao Wedding Improvement Association is strongly promoting native products and has seen positive results. The executive committee of the Society specially sent a representative with a letter yesterday to discuss ways to jointly promote this initiative. They were pleased to receive their agreement to cooperate. The Society also notes that general tableware is gradually changing from domestic porcelain to imported goods, which greatly damages the national spirit. At a time when the national economy is depleted, it is appropriate to do everything possible to reverse this trend. Therefore, starting tomorrow, they will separately contact relevant parties to ensure the use of domestic utensils in order to achieve the goal of saving the country with native products.</p>

<h3>Those with Proof of Addiction After Rehabilitation Should Still Be Ordered to Rehabilitate and Not Be Charged with Private Smoking</h3>
<p>Dagong News reports that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs yesterday instructed the county governments of Shanghai and other counties: According to a telegram from County Magistrate Zhang Jun of Ru County on September 16 of this year, after opium smokers have undergone rehabilitation in public or private hospitals or clinics, they apply for a replacement certificate within the statutory period, and if they are found to be addicted by the County Hospital and are not in a service relationship, should they be ordered by a doctor to undergo rehabilitation again, or should they still be charged with private smoking? What should be done with those who apply for a replacement certificate after the deadline and are found to be addicted? In this regard, it is found that licensed opium smokers were allowed to smoke legally before being ordered to rehabilitate. If they voluntarily undergo rehabilitation in public or private hospitals and apply for a certificate within the legal period, and are found to be addicted, they should be ordered to rehabilitate. Those who apply after the deadline and are found to be addicted should be ordered to rehabilitate. In either case, they should not be charged with private smoking.

<h3>Machine Dyeing and Weaving Association Notifies Customers About Returns</h3>

<h3>Transfer Industry Association Urges Fellow Trade Associations to Stop Watching and Risk Misleading Themselves</h3>

If the business fails to comply within the deadline, the trade association shall investigate the amended sanctions regulations and submit them to the competent authority for punishment and an order to cease operations. Therefore, in order to unite the industry, the association has specially urged companies that have not joined to join by the deadline, and not to wait and see, so as not to mislead themselves.</p>
<h3>The County Government Strictly Investigates Private Opium Traffickers</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Magistrate Li Zhifu has strictly enforced the ban on opium and the investigation of smuggling, and has recently launched a general crackdown in order to eliminate opium addiction. It is now known that opium traffickers often use convenient transportation tools such as cars or ships. Car companies and buses sometimes carry smuggled opium. Security teams have been secretly instructed to conduct inspections at any time. On the 23rd and 24th of this month, a driver named Shen Jinfu, who was a bus driver for the Song Company, was found to be privately trafficking over 110 ounces of opium at the North Bridge Station. Zhang Guanghe, an opium dealer, was carrying eight catties of opium. Both were sent to the county government for interrogation (without being directly sent to the Third District Command in Songjiang). County Magistrate Li believes that Wang Jiazhen, the captain of the first security team, and soldier Shen Linxiang have been diligent in their inspections, which is commendable. Yesterday, he instructed the security team of the Public Security Bureau to supervise and investigate at any time.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Hearing on the Property Eviction Case Filed by Tonghe Company</h3>
<p>The British-owned Tonghe Co., Ltd. had a property at No. 28 Ning’anfang, at the intersection of Huaxing Road and North Zhejiang Road in Zhabei, which was leased to the Beiyang Xiehe Hotel. Because the hotel owed rent, the company’s manager, a Briton named Mr. Baldwin, sued for eviction. However, a portion of the hotel's lower floor was sublet to Zhang Defu, who ran the Gaoshunxing Congee Shop; Ding Yukun, who ran the Qinfangzhai; and Tian Xiaofu, who ran the Linji Noodles and Rice Restaurant. Therefore, during the execution of the eviction order, Zhang and the others, as subtenants, were not parties to the case and refused to move. This made the execution of the order very difficult. Baldwin then filed another eviction lawsuit against Zhang, Ding, and Tian. The civil court of the District Court rejected the original lawsuit on the grounds that the parties to a case cannot file another lawsuit on the same legal relationship that has been adjudicated in a final judgment, as stipulated in Article 399, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law. In this case, the plaintiff leased the property at No. 28 Ning’anfang, North Zhejiang Road, to the nominal tenant, Gu Xiangzhai. The plaintiff had previously filed a lawsuit against Gu Xiangzhai for payment and eviction, and the court had ruled for eviction in Case No. 93 in the 23rd year. The nominal tenant, Gu Xiangzhai, had sublet the leased property to the defendants in this case, Gaoshunxing, Qinfangzhai, and Tian Xiaofu. Therefore, the defendants have no direct lease relationship with the plaintiff. Since the nominal tenant has been determined to be evicted by a final judgment, the defendants who sublet from the nominal tenant are bound by the final judgment. The plaintiff cannot make the defendants, who are not parties to the lease agreement, parties to the lawsuit, nor can they file another lawsuit on the same legal relationship as the final judgment (abridged below). Tonghe Co. argued that such a ruling would make the subtenants permanently exempt from paying rent and eviction, which would be tantamount to depriving them of their property rights. Therefore, they hired lawyer Ding Zhengjun to seek relief from the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court ruled to interpret Article 399, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law, stating that the so-called cause of action that has been adjudicated in a final judgment refers to the same parties. If one party is different, it cannot be considered that the lawsuit violates the law. Therefore, the original ruling was overturned, and the Shanghai District Court was ordered to make a new ruling. Yesterday, the court summoned both parties to begin the hearing, and after hearing the arguments, announced that the hearing was concluded and a judgment would be made on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>German National Smuggles Cigarettes; Escapes After Being Fined</h3>
<p>German national Shi Naide, a merchant in Shanghai, rented premises on Guangdong Road, Sichuan Road, and Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession to establish the German Naide Foreign Firm, specializing in cigarette paper. He registered with the Ministry of Finance and Taxation of the National Government and was approved to operate a cigarette paper business. After its establishment, the business was not bad. Recently, because the merchant was greedy for profit, he illegally operated a cigarette business. After the discovery, the Ministry of Finance and Taxation investigated and confirmed that Shi Naide had violated the registration regulations, and fined him 22,000 yuan. He hired Guangdong lawyer Liang Yaobing as his agent and sued the Shanghai First Special District Court for the fine. The court held a hearing with one side and made a final judgment. However, after the German merchant Shi Naide's illegal operation was discovered, he moved the business, foreign firm, and machine room to another location. Therefore, although the case has been finalized, the merchant's address is unknown, making it impossible to execute the huge fine. It is now known that the Tax Administration has offered a reward. Anyone who knows the whereabouts of Shi Naide or his property should report to lawyer Liang Yaobing at No. 131 Bowuyuan Road. Ten percent of the fine obtained after execution will be given as a reward, and the reporter's information will be kept strictly confidential.</p>
<h3>Lu A'gen Secretly Sells Drugs; Sentenced to Imprisonment; Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>Lu A'gen from Ningbo secretly sold the drug heroin for profit in Lane 590, Haining Road. The case was discovered by Wang Rulin, a Chinese detective in the Hongkou Police Station. At 10:10 AM the day before yesterday, he and a foreign detective went to the lane and arrested Lu. Fourteen small packets of heroin were found on his person and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, presented the case and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 4 of the Criminal Law and the Anti-Drug Regulations. Wang, the detective, then reported the circumstances of the discovery and presented the drugs for inspection. When questioned, the defendant confessed that a month ago, he had obtained the drugs from a Korean residing on Fusen Road, who was a fugitive known as "Little Hubei," and was selling them on commission. He begged for leniency for the rest of the confession. Judge Xiao Xieffen sentenced Lu A'gen to three years and six months imprisonment, and the exhibits were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Wife's Improper Conduct, Husband's Reprimand Leads to Suicide, Death Before Treatment</h3>
<p>A woman from Huzhou, Zhang Zhu, aged twenty-six, and her husband, Zhang Linsen, resided together at No. 6, Yan Jin Li, Yiding Pan Road, West Shanghai. Recently, this woman frequently went out and returned late at night. Her husband discovered she had been engaging in improper behavior outside. Consequently, around one o'clock yesterday morning, a quarrel erupted between the two. Afterwards, Zhang Zhu secretly swallowed raw opium and attempted suicide. She was later discovered by her family, who rushed her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, the poisoning was too severe, and the treatment proved ineffective. She died shortly thereafter. Her body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

The association also publishes a monthly magazine, "Self-Strengthening," to disseminate health knowledge as much as possible.</p>
<p>Grand Tea Party</p>
<p>While the organization of this association is prevalent in Europe and the United States, it is still pioneering in our country. Therefore, people from all walks of life are interested in promoting this emerging initiative aimed at the welfare of all citizens. Attendees yesterday included Mayor Wu, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang, Cai Jingjun, Wu Liande,  Qia Xiang, Wang Hua Fuxiao, Qin Runqing, Jin Runxiang, Wang Boqi, Mei Xian, Chen Xiangtao, Lu Shoulian, Li Dachao, Zhu Shaoping, Wu Yaqin, and over three hundred others. Guests were warmly received by Xu Xinliu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Trust Company, General Manager Xu Fu, Managing Director Wu Yunzhai, Manager Zhou Yanmin, and Chen Zhongjiu, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Health Security Association, and other shareholders. They were also given copies of printed materials explaining the mission of the Shanghai Health Security Association and the general rules for member treatment for reference.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Report</p>
<p>During the event, Mr. Xu Fu reported on the significance of establishing the Shanghai Health Security Association, saying, "The extent of the achievements of one's lifetime career in contributing to society and the nation depends on the individual's environment, intelligence, and capabilities. However, the success of a career and oneself should be judged by the presence or absence of a healthy physique. Poor physical strength makes it impossible to undertake any endeavor. This principle is clear and requires no further explanation. Just as a manufacturing business cannot produce goods in large quantities without sound machinery. People in Europe and America deeply understand the importance of health. They pay attention to diet and daily life and make every effort to pursue the principles of health preservation. As a result, many individuals are able to enjoy long lives, and their careers can be intentionally managed, often working until the age of seventy or eighty without stopping. Looking back at our country, people are considered old at the age of sixty and retire to the countryside, no longer concerned with worldly affairs. Compared with Europeans and Americans, each person loses twenty years of their career. What is the loss to the country? We are all talking about revitalizing the nation. There is more than one path to revitalization, but individuals possessing a healthy physique are the foundation for national revitalization. In recent years, the social economy has reached a point of extreme anxiety. Ordinary people are only concerned with food and clothing, preoccupied all day long without peace of mind. They have no time to care about health and daily life. Even if they occasionally suffer from illness, they often disregard it. By the time the illness becomes serious, the cost of medicine becomes unbearable. This situation is most prevalent in large cities. European and American countries consider illness to be an important issue for society in general. Chicago in the United States has the United Medical Service Chicago, and Germany has sickness insurance associations. The method is to pay the lowest possible fees during normal times, and once ill, one can enjoy reliable diagnosis and treatment, ensuring that life is not taken lightly and that everyone has the opportunity to reach the same level. Based on the above reasons, our association recently established the Shanghai Health Security Association, hiring renowned contemporary doctors for specialized diagnosis and treatment, charging low prices, and providing modern treatments, while also paying attention to instilling health knowledge and preventing diseases before they occur. On the occasion of the opening, I have briefly described the situation. I respectfully ask for your guidance. It is my great honor." It is reported that the association has many rigorously trained recruiters who will begin working immediately, welcoming citizens to join voluntarily and share in this grand undertaking.</p>

<h3>Four Individuals Forged US Dollar Banknotes, US Authorities Say Printing Was Exquisite, But Paper Quality Inferior and Numbers Poorly Made - All Four Individuals Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that on Friday, the Special Criminal Division of the Public Concession arrested two Gu individuals at the Datong Hotel and confiscated 365 counterfeit banknotes with a face value of US$20 each. The next day, they searched a house in the French Concession and seized various printing and engraving materials, as well as paper of the same material as the counterfeit banknotes used by the two individuals. They also arrested two more Taiwanese individuals and handed them over to the police department of the Japanese Consulate General. The case is currently being handled by the police department of the consulate. One of the two Taiwanese individuals walked in while the detectives were searching. He claimed to be there to retrieve a few stored items, so he may not be related to the counterfeit banknote case. The other individual is a printing and engraving craftsman and was likely hired by the counterfeiters. The case was solved due to a warning from the US Treasury Department. According to US authorities, the counterfeit banknotes were exquisitely printed, and it was difficult for ordinary people to detect the counterfeiting. However, the paper quality was inferior to that of genuine banknotes, and the printing of the serial numbers was poorly done.</p>

<p>The eighth annual meeting of the National Privately-Owned Electric Power Association will be held from November 1st to 4th at the Central Hotel in Nanjing. The executive committee of the association has been preparing everything in recent days. Many proposals from member companies have been submitted to the association. Furthermore, the Guangzhou Electric Power Company, which was originally a member of the association, was taken over by the municipal authorities. It has been decided by the central government that the issues in Guangdong and Guangxi have been unified. A telegram was sent to the association to forward the request to the central and Guangdong provincial and municipal authorities to return the company to private operation, as in the cases of the Hangzhou and Kaifeng power plants, in order to protect commercial capital. The association's summer school for the electric power industry was completed in August, with 19 graduates. Besides half of the students already holding positions, the remaining were introduced by Director Shen Sifang to major power plants to distinguish themselves. In addition, the Practical Electrical Engineering Training Class, designed to cultivate electrical engineering and accounting knowledge, began on September 5th in Hangzhou and will graduate in six months, with over a hundred students currently enrolled. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Provincial Privately-Owned Electric Power Association has been established for ten years. Its tenth annual meeting will be held on October 28th at the Dazhao Electric Company in Zhenjiang. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Dazhao Company, and a new 5,000-kilowatt generator has been installed and will be illuminated during the opening of the annual meeting, promising a grand spectacle. Furthermore, the Zhejiang Provincial Privately-Owned Electric Power Association, originally located on Huixing Road in Hangzhou, has recently moved to No. 62, Qiafeng Li, Kaiyuan Road due to the growth of its affairs and inadequate space. The eighth annual meeting of the association will be held from October 26th to 28th at the Minghua Electric Plant in Pinghu, with events including an electrical exhibition, expert lectures, discussion of proposals, election of officers, and tours of scenic spots. The association is also commemorating Chairman Li Yanshi by erecting a memorial stone at the Taowei of the Li family on the shores of Bilang Lake in Wuxing, funded by voluntary donations from colleagues, to leave a permanent memorial.

Unfortunately, heaven did not grant her a long life, and she passed away halfway through her journey. People from all walks of life in this city have initiated preparations for the posthumous honor because Madam supported her husband in his career and educated her children to success. It was decided to use the two characters 'Ci Hui' (Benevolent and Kind). These two characters fully reflect Madam's life. Holding this posthumous honor ceremony here today, Madam, if she is aware, will surely smile in the afterlife." Tong Kangling then reported on the preparations, Wu Yaqin reported on the deeds, and Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Liangyu delivered speeches in succession.

<h3>Korean Teenager Dies After Falling From Rickshaw, Hired by a Prostitute, Seemingly Died From Excessive Indulgence</h3>
<p>Near the Zhapu Road Bridge on the Suzhou Creek in Hongkou, around 10:40 AM yesterday, a rickshaw puller named Zhu Weixing, thirty-seven years old from Jiangbei, was pulling a Western-dressed teenager from north to south. Unexpectedly, the teenager suddenly fell from the rickshaw, unconscious. The rickshaw puller was terrified and attempted to abandon the rickshaw and flee. At that moment, a patrolling Japanese constable happened to pass by and detained him. Looking at the teenager's face, he looked somewhat like a Japanese person. Therefore, rumors suddenly arose there at the time. The Hongkou police station received the report and immediately dispatched British and Japanese police officers to investigate. Before long, personnel from the Japanese Consulate and the Marines also arrived and rushed the teenager to the hospital for treatment, but he soon died. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to investigate the cause of death. It was later learned that the teenager was Korean, not Japanese. According to the rickshaw puller, he had been hired from No. 18, Zhapu Li, Zhapu Road, and stated that he was going to the Great World. The fare was not discussed, and he was summoned by a young woman at the time. After obtaining the confession, the police station dispatched detectives to investigate Zhapu Li. It turned out that the place was a Korean brothel. The answers were vague. When asked about the deceased's name, they all claimed not to know. However, it was verified that there were traces of semen on the deceased's underwear. Observers believed that he died from patronizing a prostitute.</p>
<h3>County Local Association Requests Postponement of Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County land tax reform, converting it to a land value tax, is scheduled to be implemented this year. However, local individuals believe that the land value estimated by the County Land Administration Bureau is too high and have requested a temporary postponement of the tax collection for re-evaluation. The government has not yet expressed its position, but it appears that it will be implemented this year. Therefore, the County Local Association held a membership meeting yesterday, attended by over forty individuals. After careful discussion of the matter, they unanimously advocated for the postponement of the tax collection for re-evaluation. It is reported that the association, considering the importance of the matter, will further consult with the township chiefs in the county to seek their opinions.</p>
<h3>Xue Gansheng's Wife and Daughter Request Mediation to Settle the Accounts of Xian Kangrun, Defendants Xue Yansheng et al. Agree, Court Adjourns for Both Parties to Investigate and Review Accounts</h3>
<p>The late pigment magnate Xue Baorun (also known as Liquan) had four sons: Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gensheng. All the movable and immovable property left by Xue Baorun was inherited by the four sons. Now, the eldest son, Xue Gansheng, has also passed away. His wife, Madam Xue Shi, residing at No. 16, Qishancun, Yuyuan Road, recently filed a petition with the First Special Court's Civil Division, along with her daughter, Xue Guiwei (aged twenty), and lawyers Chao Kun and Gao Danhua, against Xue Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gensheng, requesting mediation. The petition for mediation states that the defendants have occupied the jointly owned property, sold it without clear division of the proceeds, and requests the court to summon them to hand over the accounts for review, settlement, and division of management rights. The petitioners, Madam Xue Shi, are the legal wife of the late Xue Gansheng, and Xue Wanwei is Gansheng's biological daughter. Gansheng and the defendants are all sons of the late Xue Liquan. After Liquan's death, all his estate, excluding most of the immovable property jointly inherited by the four sons, including the Xian Kangrun Pigment Company and other movable and immovable properties, was jointly managed by Gansheng and his brothers at the time. When Gansheng passed away, the petitioners, Madam Xue Shi and Xue Wanwei, along with the illegitimate children Zhidong, Yuwei, and Zhenwei, requested and were granted the administration of the estate certificate (Jinguanzi No. 42) issued by the court in the 19th year of the Republic, based on Gansheng's will. The petitioners, as Gansheng's heirs, further applied for and were granted the administration of the estate certificate (Jinguanzi No. 20) issued by the court in the 23rd year of the Republic, proving that the petitioners and Xue Zhidong, etc., have a one-quarter joint ownership of all the immovable property listed in the administration of the estate certificate (Jinguanzi No. 42) issued in the 19th year. Furthermore, the defendants provide the petitioners with a monthly living allowance of 22 yuan, while the other millions of dollars of assets are arbitrarily occupied and used by the defendants without allowing the petitioners to inquire. Moreover, in the autumn of last year, the defendants even sold a portion of the immovable property that was previously adjudicated and certified by the court as jointly owned by the petitioners, obtaining over 390,000 yuan in proceeds, which they secretly plotted to divide among themselves. The petitioners requested disclosure of the use of the funds, but they have not been informed. Therefore, they request that the defendants be summoned to court to order the submission of the Xian Kangrun Pigment Company's accounts for all years for review, settlement, and division of property rights, to clarify the ownership. The case was mediated by Judge Guo Wei at the Civil Division 11 the other day. Xue Yansheng and Jiasheng attended, accompanied by lawyer Wu Linkun. They agreed to a joint investigation of the accounts of the Xian Kangrun Pigment Company. Mr. Guo adjourned the proceedings to allow both parties to investigate and review the accounts.</p>

<h3>Xu Bozhang's Scandalous Lawsuit Ends, It's Difficult to Be a Husband Between Wife and Concubine, Mediation Brings a Peaceful End</h3>
<p>Xu Bozhang, a forty-year-old native of Minhou, Fujian, engages in the glass business in Shanghai. His wife, Wang Ai'yu, is thirty-two years old and resides in their hometown. Xu, due to his individual stay in Shanghai, disliked the loneliness of his solitary bed and took a woman surnamed Pan Jingyu (twenty-two years old) from Changzhou as his concubine in Shanghai two years ago. He rented a house for her in Fengyu Li on Route Sa坡赛 in the French Concession and lived with her in intimate affection. After a year, she gave birth to a daughter named Dezhen, who is now two years old. At the beginning of this summer, Xu's legal wife, Wang Ai'yu, came to Shanghai from Fujian. Xu rented a room for her at No. 22, Dacheng Apartment, Rue Pu柏 and lived with her. Because he had concealed the fact that he took Pan as a concubine from Wang, Xu accompanied Wang in and out after she came to Shanghai, gradually distancing himself from Pan. Pan suspected that Xu had found a new lover outside and abandoned her. After finding out the address, she reported to the French police station, accusing Xu of adultery with someone. The police sent detectives to Dacheng Apartment to catch Xu and Wang in the act. After learning that they were a legal couple, they did not file public charges of adultery against Xu and Wang. Pan then sued Xu Bozhang for bigamy and sent him to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After trial, because the statute of limitations had expired, the verdict was dismissed. Pan was unwilling to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division against Xu Bozhang for obstructing public morals, along with a civil suit seeking alimony and educational expenses for the daughter, totaling 5,000 yuan. Xu repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned. Xu's wife, Wang Ai'yu, also hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division against Pan Jingyu for false accusation and defamation, along with a civil suit seeking compensation for damages to reputation and mental distress, totaling 2,000 yuan. The trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty for Pan Jingyu, and the associated civil suit was dismissed. Wang was dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch Court. The court heard the case but did not conclude the proceedings. The recent case of Pan Jingyu's private prosecution against Xu Bozhang for obstructing public morals was summoned again, but Xu still did not appear, so the hearing was postponed. Xu, burdened by the endless litigation, found it difficult to conduct business and persuaded someone to mediate with Pan Jingyu. Xu paid Pan 1,000 yuan for alimony and the daughter's educational expenses, to be paid in installments. Pan would raise the daughter and return her to Xu Bozhang to be retrieved when she reached the age of sixteen. Pan would also publish an apology to Wang Ai'yu in the newspaper. Both parties agreed to the terms and, the other day, the lawyers of both parties accompanied their clients to the court to sign the settlement agreement. Both parties withdrew their private prosecutions and appeals. A scandalous dispute thus came to an end.</p>

At the age of thirty, he returned to his hometown and organized the Sincere Company with Ma Yingbiao and others. At the age of sixty-one, he was assigned as manager of the Shanghai Sincere Company. The following year, he was promoted to supervisor. Li Dachao delivered a speech, stating that Huang's life achievements had been detailed by the officiating group, which showed Huang's extraordinary contributions to social undertakings and commerce.

We looked forward to a long life together, forever under his protection. Autumn came, illness struck, and misfortune descended. Heaven did not have mercy, depriving us of our leader. Alas, the man is gone, but his example remains. We feel deep sorrow and yearn for his immortal trace. May you, sir, be aware and appreciate our humble hearts. Accept this offering!</p>

Crossing the Great Wall, from Juyong in the east to Hami in the west, wherever he went, he inquired in detail about politics and military affairs from officials and discussed local anecdotes with the militia. He also extensively investigated the national defense situation and local customs. The correspondence he wrote was later published in this newspaper, and many readers wrote requesting it to be published as a complete work. The entire book is divided into two volumes, with over one hundred articles and over two hundred thousand words. It can be read together or separately and includes over thirty copperplate photos taken on-site.

<h3>Lin Tianji Accused of Enticement; Female Student Appeals; Lin Initially Wins Lawsuit, Has Gone to Guangdong; Appeal Hearing Concluded, Verdict Scheduled</h3>
<p>Lin Tianji, a native of Guangdong and the director of the audit department of the Central Bank, age 49, residing at 24 Model Village, Jiangwan Road, was previously accused by Jing Youmei (age 21, a high-achieving student at a certain middle school in Huzhou, Zhejiang) through her father, Jing Kegong, of enticement and abandonment at the First Special Court's Criminal Division. In the first trial, Lin Tianji was found not guilty. Jing Kegong, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired a lawyer and filed an appeal with the Second High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Huating presided over the hearing. The defendant, Lin Tianji, was in Guangdong due to an issue, so he did not attend. Only the appellants, Jing Kegong and his daughter, attended the hearing. According to Jing Kegong's appeal grounds, he said that he was doing business outside of Shanghai. His daughter, Youmei, came to Shanghai in the 21st year of the Republic of China to enroll in a certain girls' middle school. Unfortunately, she met a female classmate, Shen Xifan, and went to the Sincere Company to shop together. They met Lin Tianji in the company. Shen introduced him to his daughter. Lin used clever words to seduce her and caused a physical relationship to occur. Afterwards, he rented houses at 55 Yongfengfang, North Sichuan Road, and 20 Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road, and began to live together. Although he repeatedly requested Lin to fulfill the marriage ceremony, he kept evading it. At this point, his daughter was pregnant. His wife also found out at this time, but he still knew nothing about it. On August 2nd in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, she gave birth to a son, named Zhongzheng by the defendant. His daughter became ill after childbirth and was treated for more than a year before recovering. All medical expenses were also paid by Lin. Unexpectedly, Lin's attitude suddenly changed and he abandoned his daughter and son. He is already old and only has one daughter, preparing to rely on her in the future. Now, Lin Tianji has seduced her, started and abandoned her, which is inconsistent with human relations and morality. Therefore, he filed an appeal to request that he be punished for his crimes. After arguments by lawyers from both sides, the court adjourned and a verdict will be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Child Custody Case Resolved; Child's Biological Father, Chen, Initially Takes Her Back; Fee Shared by Chen and He Chengfu</h3>
<p>Chen Jingchu, a native of Yancheng and an inspector at the Shanghai Education Bureau, lost his wife in July of last year. He adopted out his three-year-old daughter, Xiaofeng, to his classmate and good friend, He Chengfu, the director of academic affairs at Minli Girls' High School and teacher at Qingxin Girls' High School. A year later, Chen suddenly wanted to take the girl back, but He refused. Chen then reported the matter to the French Police and brought He Chengfu and his wife, He Qiu, to the Special Court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution for enticement, and Chen also filed a civil suit, demanding the return of the child. Judge Zhang Chaozuo mediated the dispute and persuaded both parties to reconcile, and Wang Manyun, Sun Bawu, and others also mediated. However, the reconciliation broke down because Chen objected to issuing a public apology. The trial result was a transfer to the Shanghai District Court due to jurisdictional error. The child was ordered to be temporarily cared for in a nursery pending the court decision. The two parties were each ordered to pay 50 yuan in expenses. It was reported in this newspaper that the girl was unable to be admitted to the nursery due to her age. The two parties still refused to concede, insisting on taking the girl back. The court ordered the child to temporarily remain at Guangci Hospital until the case was settled. It is now known that the case has been mediated by Yang Huchen, Xuan Bokun, and other friends. Chen will reimburse He for 250 yuan in support expenses, and the child will be taken back by Chen. Yang and Xuan, as mediators, will publish an explanation of the misunderstanding between Chen and He. Both parties have complied with the mediator's intentions and resolved the matter. The parties and the mediators petitioned Judge Zhang to hold a hearing at the Second Special Court. After clarifying the reconciliation terms and signing the minutes, the court ordered the police to go to Guangci Hospital to bring the girl, Chen Xiaofeng, to the court. In court, the girl was handed over to her biological father, Chen Jingchu. He and his wife, seeing the lively and active girl they had raised for fourteen months being taken away by Chen, could only recover the support expenses. They could not help but feel heartbroken and cry out loud. After being persuaded by friends, they went back dejectedly. A child custody case involving intellectuals has come to an end.</p>

However, Feipu was not willing to show weakness and returned a goal, pulling it to a tie. In the second half, Ji's offensive became more urgent, and Feipu's defense became more solid. They held on for a long time without seeing a winner. Finally, Jiqing scored a goal, making the score four to three. Jiqing won.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>Fifty Years of Chinese Industry as if One Day  Liu Tang</h3>
<p>When discussing China's unfavorable trade and the reasons for China's economic backwardness, one cannot help but recall that fifty years ago, China was already boasting and drumming up support, using industrial development and national strengthening as slogans. At that time, all the proposals and suggestions, apart from the natural evolution due to the times, can be said to be largely the same as our current proposals and suggestions. In fact, many of them have not been implemented to this day. The spirit of our people in handling affairs is so slow and lacks vigor, which is rare in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu in the Guangxu period (43 years ago), China's powerful navy was defeated by Japan's "small but effective" navy. To sue for peace after the defeat, Japan insisted on a "highly respected, renowned, and fully responsible" "peacemaker" (because he was always the one to negotiate with foreigners), Li Hongzhang, to negotiate. When Li arrived in Shimonoseki, the Japanese plenipotentiary Ito Hirobumi bluntly said to Li:</p>
<p>"In the past ten years, China has not changed its old ways, resulting in this situation. It is a shared regret."</p>
<p>What an incredibly humorous "shared regret"!</p>
<p>China's industrial development has had a history of fifty years (at least), so why is it still the same as before, without establishing an industrial foundation, and even suffering more and more, with the situation deteriorating, and the hope of national industry ever rising seemingly non-existent? This is certainly due to foreign economic aggression, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki allowing foreigners to set up factories in China's treaty ports, which was a major cause. However, even without foreign troubles, it is feared that China's industry would still have difficulty in developing healthily. This statement may not be well received, but if it could have developed healthily, the reality would certainly not be the same as it is today.</p>
<p>"Do not forget the past, it can be a guide for the future." The fruits of today, how can we know that they were not the seeds sown in the past? Therefore, I will not talk about the present, but about the past; especially the past of the past, not in the Republic of China, but in the Qing Dynasty. Because today's industry and commerce began to develop fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Why did people feel the need to develop industry fifty years ago? It's a long story; in short, it was also due to the impact of European and American influences and the stimulation of defeats in wars that people began to strive for strength and emulate the West. Therefore, from the Tongzhi period after the Taiping Rebellion was quelled to the early Guangxu period was the first phase of industrial development. Because the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion was aided by foreign-trained foreign gun teams, and shocked by the sharpness of guns and cannons and the convenience of machinery, Zeng, Zuo, Li and others all valued them. The establishment of machine bureaus and shipyards, such as the Jiangnan and Mawei ship administration bureaus, and the machine bureaus in Shanghai and other major provincial capitals, and what was called the machine bureau at that time was actually a weapons manufacturing bureau. The ships built by the ship administration bureaus were mostly small steamers (called "偷鷄包" (tōu jī bāo), which is probably a transliteration of "Steam Boat"). The guns and cannons made by the machine bureaus not only required foreign materials; even the products were outdated. They were sufficient to deal with bandits armed with bows and arrows and swords, but insufficient to resist foreign giant ships and cannons. Therefore, whenever foreign wars occurred, military equipment and ships were temporarily ordered from overseas. This was the case in the Sino-French War, and this was also the case in the Sino-Japanese War. A kind of panicked look of no preparation in peacetime and no response in emergencies is truly laughable and tearful when we look back (I wonder if future generations will see the present in the same way.) However, Zuo Zongtang's suppression of the West was said to be aided by guns and cannons. However, his guns and cannons were bought from Germany, not made by the domestic machine bureau. Moreover, the guns and cannons he used were mostly muzzle-loading guns with copper caps, with only a few breech-loading guns and small steel cannons. How could they resist the ever-changing foreign troops? But this can be said to be the starting period of China's military industry.</p>
<p>Hu Linyi saw the steamboats sailing so fast, thought that foreign troops could easily take them to China, and actually fainted in a moment of anxiety. Perhaps this is an exaggerated story, but the establishment of ship administration bureaus in Fujian and Shanghai was precisely to manufacture steamships, and the establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was also to implement this proposition. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established in the eleventh year of Tongzhi at the request of Li Hongzhang, with "merchants undertaking the operation and officials maintaining it," hence it was called the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (But at that time, all those who recruited merchants to undertake operations were called the China Merchants Bureau, such as the copper in Yunnan, which was handed over to merchants in the early Guangxu period, and was also called the China Merchants Bureau, so the terms "Steam Navigation" etc. were added to distinguish it.) Furthermore, in view of the negotiations between China and Russia to recover Ili, Zeng Jize sent a telegram from the Russian capital, which arrived in the evening after being sent in the morning. However, a letter from Shanghai to Beijing, which is two thousand several hundred miles away, would take ten days by post or six or seven days by steamer. Therefore, feeling the importance of the telegram, the telegraph line from Tianjin to Shanghai was laid in the fifth year of Guangxu. Although the postal system was not clearly defined, it was also being promoted. This was the starting period of the transportation industry. However, the railway, which is most convenient for transportation, was still rejected because it was thought to be "not applicable to China." In September of Guangxu's reign, 285,000 taels were spent to buy out the Songhu Railway built by the British and demolish it. It was not until later (in the thirteenth year of Guangxu), after the Sino-French War, that the inconvenience of transferring troops inside and outside the customs was deeply felt, and then it was thought to use the coal railway of the Kaiping Mining Bureau to extend it to Dagu and Shanhaiguan to supply the reception of sea and land transportation troops. By the twenty-first year of Guangxu, Zhang Zhidong had a proposal for the Luhan Railway (now the Pinghan Railway), and then he and Wang Wenshao jointly recommended Sheng Xuanhuai, the customs officer of Tianjin, as a fourth-rank official awaiting appointment in Beijing, to supervise the railway head office. The railway had already begun to be built, and foreign loans had also been successively negotiated and established. Border officials used the railway to mortgage foreign debts, providing for temporary squandering and rich commissions, without considering that foreign forces were deeply involved in the interior, sowing many diplomatic disputes in the future, and increasing the heavy burden on future generations. Did those officials at the time consider this unlimited disaster due to a moment of greed?</p>
<p>In the early years of the Guangxu period, foreign goods were imported like a tide. In the first two years, trade was still</p>

<p>Era Medicine and Marital Knowledge</p>
<p>Authored by Dr. Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>How to Spend a Blissful Bridal Night...</p>
<p>...A simple and clear common sense guide to the needs of sexual life...</p>
<p>...Love should not be built on a contract, but on a foundation of health...</p>
<p>Sometimes, after marriage, a wife discovers that her husband has an unspeakable hidden disease, and she is greatly distressed. Even during the sweet honeymoon period, she cannot avoid sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. The causes of hidden diseases and diminishing virility in men are mostly due to excessive indulgence in lust and the bad habit of masturbation.</p>
<p>If a young man has such a weak and abnormal problem, he should not marry. Most men who do not understand medical principles are ignorant of this principle. Many recklessly ignore it and still marry, completely disregarding the woman's happiness and joy. This is too cruel to her. Since he inflicts such cruelty on the woman, the law recognizes this as an unquestionable reason for divorce, or even invalidates the marriage, because if the marriage cannot be practically consummated, it should not be considered legal. Just imagine, if a man and a woman encounter such a thing, isn't it a great loss of both mental health and money?</p>
<p>Therefore, every young man should pay attention to saving this serious matter. He must know that for a man's premature ejaculation and impotence, the couple should take this issue to study, in order to see if there is a way to cure it. The important thing is that the man must strictly adhere to hygiene methods within a certain period, such as exercise, cold water baths, etc., and he must thoroughly control his imagination, so as to use medicine.</p>
<p>Premature ejaculation and impotence are not incurable diseases. Professor Warren S. Thompson of Miami University is a famous venereologist in contemporary America. He published a field investigation record in his academic masterpiece "Population Problem." He announced that "Glandular Substance," a gonadotrophic hormone preparation, has cured three times as many young American men suffering from impotence and premature ejaculation as other medicines. Indeed, when in the United States, I witnessed a Jewish businessman with impotence who was completely cured after taking "Glandular Substance" for only two months. This is indeed a symptomatic remedy for those who cannot lead a fulfilling sexual life.</p>
<p>What Awaits Women Whose Love Fails?</p>
<p>Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>...Health and beauty are the driving force of light for women and a must-have for modern women...</p>
<p>...The development of the hips and the height of the breasts are the foundation of female beauty...</p>
<p>It seems that in modern times, the achievement of female health and beauty through the efficacy of medicine has reached a successful path. According to Bertillon, a famous German physiologist, and Dr. Hamlet, a beauty expert, practical evidence shows that the healthy development of a woman is closely related to the reproductive glands in her body. At the same time, Dr. Knight Dunlap of Johns Hopkins University stated that the development of a woman's breasts and hips can only be achieved with strong reproductive glands, which can lead to plump curves and a healthy body. The doctor infers that the reason why modern fashionable women have high breasts and developed muscles, even surpassing weak men, is entirely because the original weakness of the female reproductive glands has been changed. Recent physical fitness tests of women in various regions and various sports records are gradually catching up with men. Therefore, Dr. Deng believes that if every weak woman, especially those with incomplete development, flat or shriveled breasts, and irregular menstruation, can be saved with a glandular hormone endocrine preparation, no one dares to dogmatically say that in a few years, a woman's physique and strength will definitely not be able to catch up with the standard of men.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the German Science News Agency, women in Germany and Austria are particularly enthusiastic about promoting fitness exercises. Within the first six months of this year, a total of 169,300 women who lost their health and went to hospitals and beauty salons in various provinces for scientific remedies were statistically significant, with shriveled breasts and irregular menstruation being the most common, estimated at 130,074 people. It is said that more than 87 percent of these more than 130,000 women with shriveled breasts and irregular menstruation were completely cured by the female "Glandular Substance," a glandular hormone preparation. This is enough to prove the value of glandular hormone endocrine preparations in beauty and medicine.</p>
<p>Indeed, the authority of science can dominate everything for mankind in the 20th century, and we cannot deny it. Health and beauty are the driving force of light for women, and a must-have for modern women. The development of the hips and the height of the breasts are the foundation of female beauty, and also a sharp weapon for winning in love. Girls of the era, you stand at the forefront of the era, and you must never forget the benefits that this sharp weapon bestows upon you!</p>
<p>Common Sense of Bone Pain Erodes Human Health - Bone Pain Disease</p>
<p>Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing for a person is to get sick; the more unfortunate thing is to suffer from bone pain. Because once you get sick, your health will be completely destroyed. However, ordinary diseases are not difficult to treat, but it is not easy to treat people with bone pain. Because if you suffer from diseases of the skin, muscles, or internal organs, there are special medicines to treat them, but the situation with bone pain is very different. The root of the disease is either deeply hidden in the bone marrow or is a rheumatic internal accumulation, so it is difficult to treat. In the past, there was no way to deal with this disease. Looking at the general elderly people, almost all of them suffer from bone pain. Whenever the weather is cloudy or during seasonal changes, or when they work a little, their limbs and bones immediately ache, because there is no special medicine to treat it, they can only endure the pain. It was not until now that Dr. Johnston of the United States invented "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills," so the world has another savior. It has cured countless bone pains, and people's health has also been guaranteed. Moreover, this medicine can not only treat various bone pains, but also prevent kidney inflammation, arteriosclerosis, stroke, uremia, etc.</p>
<p>The patient, Huang Zhuan, 52 years old, has suffered from rheumatic bone pain for decades. In his prime, he served in the military, galloped across the battlefield, and was also fond of seeking pleasure, indulging in the sea of lust. It was not until five years later that he gradually felt unable to support himself, but he still praised himself as a strong man and did not consider the future. Ten years ago, he felt pain all over his body and soreness in his bones, especially in cloudy weather or during seasonal changes, the soreness was even more intense. Later, he became more and more severely ill, and even a slight exertion would cause pain. For more than ten years, he lived in a state of deep water and hot fire, and his health was almost completely destroyed. After I diagnosed him, I immediately diagnosed him as having rheumatic bone pain, and treated him according to Johnston's method, taking "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" internally. After finishing four bottles, the bone pain that had plagued him for more than ten years was cured, and his bones were relaxed, and he regained his health.</p>
<p>Health Broadcasting Station - Young People Anesthetized by Masturbation</p>
<p>Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Treatment for Health Loss Due to Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>...Neurasthenia and impotence/premature ejaculation are almost inevitable for those who suffer from spermatorrhea...</p>
<p>...Masturbation during adolescence carries the risk of promoting incomplete development...</p>
<p>Masturbation, whether male or female, is something everyone commits. In fact, the degree of harm it causes to the body varies from person to person. Due to differences in constitution, age, and frequency, some show significant harm and develop various symptoms, while others are less affected, but this is a small minority.</p>
<p>So, under what circumstances does this behavior (masturbation) produce the most harmful results? Distinguishing from the constitution, those with a nervous constitution find this kind of harm the most obvious. Observing from age, those under the age of 20 (when the body is not yet fully developed) who commit this behavior excessively will experience more significant obstacles than adults. Because during that period, the body is small, the resistance is weak, and as a result of masturbation fatigue, it can cause weakness of the nervous system, which affects the whole body. The harms are countless.</p>
<p>Regarding the frequency problem, regardless of constitution or age, if masturbation is committed excessively, violating natural physiology and causing physical and mental fatigue, the impact is very great, and it will cause various diseases in all aspects.</p>
<p>Why does masturbation harm people so deeply? In fact, after masturbation, too much semen is discharged by chance, and masturbation only relies on unnatural fantasies, striving to fantasize and speculate, so it is very easy to weaken attention and reasoning power, and spermatorrhea is unavoidable. Imagine that since semen is discharged endlessly by masturbation, plus the threat of tight spermatorrhea, the semen produced by the human body will inevitably be exhausted. After spermatorrhea, it is a hint of weakness. If spermatorrhea is not cured as soon as possible, neurasthenia will follow, and at the same time, troublesome diseases such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development are unavoidable.</p>
<p>The most effective treatment is sought by masturbating young people in their dreams. Before this effective treatment is implemented, the degree of damage should be carefully examined. If there is spermatorrhea or slippery essence, "Hemet's Semen Consolidating Tablets" must be taken to consolidate the essence and stop spermatorrhea. This is a reasonable and symptomatic good medicine recognized by experts in various countries. Over the years, tens of thousands have been cured by this, and I have cured many young people with spermatorrhea with the help of this medicine, and have never felt any difficulty. In addition, if there are symptoms such as neurasthenia and impotence or premature ejaculation, then you must take "Glandular Substance" again.</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Disease Lecture</p>
<p>Compiled by Dr. Yao Erchang and Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>In recent times, the number of people suffering from sexually transmitted diseases is innumerable. Roughly analyzing them, the two major categories of impotence/premature ejaculation and masturbation/spermatorrhea are the most common, especially among young adults. If not treated early, the former can cause the hope of offspring to be lost, and life will be meaningless; the latter can lose essence and damage vitality, and life will be in danger. Both are dangerous conditions and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>(1) Treatment for Impotence and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient: Jin Tingrong, 32 years old, from Luoyang, Henan (Chief complaint): He has been married for thirteen years since he got married at the age of nineteen, but his wife has not yet become pregnant. However, his wife is healthy and has no illness, and is definitely not a woman who cannot give birth. In fact, it is because he himself suffers from impotence and premature ejaculation (Medical history): He mistakenly committed masturbation during development, and also suffered from spermatorrhea. After four years of marriage, he also worked hard in sexual affairs, and his sexual nerves have long been paralyzed. There is no pleasure in intercourse, which leads to impotence and premature ejaculation. He wants to erect but cannot, and even if he erects, he is not firm, and he ejaculates as soon as he touches his body. Life is meaningless, and because he has been married for more than ten years and has no children, he is extremely anxious. He only came for diagnosis and treatment last autumn (Treatment method): The patient's reproductive gland endocrine has returned to normal, and he was immediately given "Glandular Substance," a glandular hormone preparation, internally to promote the health of the reproductive glands. At the same time, he underwent electrotherapy and surgery once a day. By early winter, his reproductive function had completely recovered. He wrote a letter last month saying that he had given birth to a male child who was fat and lovable.</p>
<p>(2) Rescue for Masturbation and Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient: Li Jusun, 23 years old, working at a local exchange (Chief complaint): During adolescence, he committed the bad habit of masturbation. At first, he was lured by bad friends, and then it became a natural habit. He must masturbate once every night, and even masturbate in the morning for a moment of pleasure. As a result, his face was sallow and thin, his nerves were extremely weak, he was absent-minded at work, and his development was also hindered. When he tried to quit, spermatorrhea followed, and the daily spermatorrhea was even worse than masturbation. He also had no dreams, was lazy in the morning, and felt uncomfortable all day long. His body was even more depleted. Please treat him quickly (Treatment method): First, he was given the special medicine "Hemet's Semen Consolidating Tablets" to stop spermatorrhea, and then "Glandular Substance," a glandular hormone preparation, to nourish the deficiency, and electrotherapy was performed to promote the consolidation of the semen. After less than two months of triple treatment, this severe spermatorrhea was cured miraculously. It has been half a year since then, and it has not recurred, and his weight has increased by ten pounds.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Suffering from leukorrhea is a very painful thing, which is indeed true. Three months ago, I was ravaged by it. I couldn't tell anyone my suffering, and there was no medicine I could take to treat myself. I had to change my underwear several times a day, and I also had back pain and headaches, and I was in a state of mental depression. Later, fortunately, Mrs. Li, who lived with me, introduced me to Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy "Leukorrhea Elixir" for external use, and then I took "Female Glandular Substance" to be cured completely and escape from my sea of suffering. Therefore, I would like to introduce it. (Wang Zhenying)</p>

<p>Medical Team of the League of Nations Health Organization Confirms the Direction of Treating Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Original article published in The TimeNews, translated by Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>...Gather opinions from venereal disease experts...</p>
<p>...Refer to the clinical experience of famous doctors...</p>
<p>German Chancellor Hitler is trying to eliminate the spread of venereal diseases in the country, and is actively trying to control the treatment of venereal diseases. He especially attaches great importance to the harm of gonococcal bacteria. According to reliable sources, the Health Section of the League of Nations, in view of the rampant gonococcus in the world, has gathered experts in gonorrhea from various countries since this year, collected clinical experience from first-class doctors from various countries, and determined the steps to treat gonorrhea. Mr. B. D. Slainn, a reporter for the Times in Geneva, once consulted Dr. Joison M.D., a key figure in the team. According to the doctor, gonorrhea is indeed the most stubborn symptom of venereal disease, so a special organization has been established to study it. Although injection therapy cannot be consistent, regarding oral medicine therapy, most unanimously recommend "Anti-Gonorrhea," a combination of yellow pigment and vaccine. The reason why this medicine has won high praise from famous doctors around the world is due to the crystallization of Dr. Jetteson's 15 years of research and improvement in Germany. It is truly the most glorious page in Germany's medical history. (Editor's note: The efficacy of "Anti-Gonorrhea" has occupied an incomparable honor in my country's medical field. However, in addition to taking this medicine, women should also use "Leukorrhea Elixir" as a suppository to clear leukorrhea.)</p>
<p>Tips for Quitting Smoking - Several Points to Pay Attention to When Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience, there are about the following three points to pay attention to when quitting smoking: (1) Test the quitter's psychology, (2) Pay attention to the quitter's physique, (3) Apply a safe and nourishing method to help quit smoking. Because the quitter's psychology is often filled with terrifying pain, or because the quitter's physique is not healthy and cannot bear the pain of quitting. To solve these two problems, only the nourishing method to help quit smoking in the third point has real efficacy.</p>
<p>The nourishing method to help quit smoking was invented by Mr. Stanner of Austria. First, use reproductive gland preparations to nourish the quitter's body, so as to enhance his resistance to nicotine. Then, inject "Yu Weisi Life-Saving," so as to promote metabolism and enhance internal organ tissues, so that diseases are not easy to invade. With such a method, the quitter will not suffer the slightest pain, and it is safe and effective. It is not difficult to completely eliminate nicotine addiction in a short period of time.</p>
<p>There was Song Yongming, 45 years old, who had been smoking for more than 20 years. He usually smoked a lot, and he could not enjoy himself if he did not smoke more than three coins. He had repeatedly planned to quit, but he was afraid of suffering, and he was also physically unable to support himself, so he never succeeded. Later, I used the above-mentioned nourishing method to help quit smoking, taking "Glandular Substance," a reproductive gland preparation, internally, and injecting "Yu Weisi Life-Saving." In less than two months, nicotine addiction was completely eliminated, and he was no longer in pain and his body was stronger.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao Local Edition: Record of Lung Fluoroscopy</p>
<p>(Jin Desheng)</p>
<p>Our country is a region where tuberculosis is rampant. If you are not careful, you may contract lung disease. Although tuberculosis is called a dangerous disease, it is not difficult to eliminate the germs if you diagnose and treat it before it becomes serious. My younger brother, Fusheng, is studious and physically weak, and has a slight cough and his weight is decreasing day by day. Because there is a person with lung disease living with him, I was afraid that he would also be infected, so I took him to the French Concession Father and Son Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. After the director of the hospital used X-rays to fluoroscop his lungs, there were three or four black spots on the apex of his left lung, and one or two black spots on his right lung. He was diagnosed with early tuberculosis and was immediately treated with electroacupuncture. Soon, his cough disappeared and his weight gradually increased. Three weeks later, he was fluoroscoped again, and the black spots seen last time had disappeared without a trace, and my younger brother escaped from the terrible tuberculosis and became a lively young man again. Today, science is prosperous and there are more and more sharp weapons. Diseases will not be allowed to attack. I am not only happy that my younger brother has recovered, but also tell the world that those who are suspected of having lung disease should be examined as soon as possible, so as to avoid any delays.</p>
<p>Reliable Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>(Jinghua)</p>
<p>Young men, venturing into brothels, unfortunately contract gonorrhea. They may neglect treatment, or be confused by illegal treatments such as "one injection cures the root" or "cures in three days," or they may be greedy for cheap prices and buy fake medicines, resulting in chronic gonorrhea that cannot be completely cured for months or years. This not only harms themselves, but also infects their wives and concubines. As a result, men have no sperm and women are infertile. It is said that gonorrhea can destroy people's ancestry. There is good reason for this. Examining chronic gonorrhea, which is commonly known as "old white turbidity," the mucous membrane of the urethra is infected by the disease and becomes a widespread wound. This is especially true in the posterior urethra. The mucous membrane granules and glands are all infiltrated and swollen. The urine contains strands and the turbid liquid is sometimes present and sometimes absent, mostly thin. Only after getting up in the morning, the urethral opening is sealed by a small amount of mucus, otherwise there is no pain. At this time, gonococci are not easy to prove. Because the gonorrhea has turned chronic, the gonococci mostly penetrate deep under the mucous membrane and lie dormant. When there is an opportunity, they take advantage of the situation to attack again. Therefore, it is not easy to find gonococci in the mucus. Nowadays, the diagnosis of chronic gonorrhea mostly uses the injection of serum to make the dormant gonococci reappear in the thin mucus. Then, examination with a microscope can prove it. Therefore, the treatment of chronic gonorrhea requires a reliable clinic diagnosis and excellent equipment to achieve a radical cure. The ancients said that chronic gonorrhea is a chronic disease that can never be cured, because the diagnosis was not done properly and there was no corresponding equipment to use. In modern times, science is becoming more prosperous and electrotherapy is developing rapidly. The invention of the shortwave diathermy machine has been used to treat gonorrhea, especially chronic gonorrhea. The efficacy is remarkable, surpassing all other treatments. It generates high heat and penetrates deep into the mucous membrane of the urethra, without damaging the tissue and completely killing the gonococci. It truly deserves to be a sharp weapon for treating gonorrhea. (Editor's Note: The Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession is fully equipped with electrotherapy equipment for the treatment of gonorrhea. For example, the hospital has many types of shortwave diathermy machines. Therefore, those who go for treatment are treated according to their symptoms, and they are all cured quickly. Their success with electrotherapy is truly significant.)</p>
<p>Free Examination for Male and Female Gonorrhea</p>
<p>(Wenqin)</p>
<p>Because some genital diseases, such as prostatitis, urethritis, and semen leakage, are very similar to the symptoms of gonorrhea, ordinary people often find it difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, they are secretly worried and randomly take medicine, which instead makes the disease worse. There is also a situation where gonorrhea is not cured, or they have just contracted gonorrhea, but they do not recognize it as gonorrhea, which leads to delays and mistakes. Wouldn't that be absurd? To identify the cause of this disease, it is best to use a microscope to examine the urine, which can distinguish whether there are gonococci and determine whether it is gonorrhea. This way, you will not blindly follow medicine. In Shanghai, there is a place that examines gonorrhea and does not charge a fee. That is the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. It is also very convenient for women who suffer from leukorrhea and want to check whether it is gonorrhea. And they are treated with the same preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Fertility</p>
<p>(Jingqiu)</p>
<p>Leukorrhea refers to the general term for secretions leaking from the female reproductive organs. This leukorrhea is one of the most troublesome things for women. However, there are many types of leukorrhea. All diseases of the various parts of the reproductive organs can cause this. The mucous membrane of a healthy uterus body does not secrete much. It only excretes a small amount of serous secretions, and the mucous membrane of the cervical canal is responsible for the secretion of mucus. Usually, the external cervical opening is closed by glass-like mucus. If it slips off, it leaks from the vagina to moisturize the vulva. If its secretion increases once, it leaks out continuously, contaminating and wetting the vulva and its surroundings or underclothes. This is called leukorrhea. Ninety-five percent of leukorrhea comes from the uterus. The main symptom is chronic endometritis. Nowadays, it is said that leukorrhea comes from cervicitis more often than endometritis. The color of the leaking leukorrhea is not uniform. Some are viscous like glass, some are white mucus-like pus, and some are thick and pus-like. The vulva is moistened when leukorrhea leaks, and it feels very uncomfortable. In obese women, the skin on the vulva and the inside of the thighs becomes swollen, hot, and eroded due to the stimulation of secretions. Pain comes with it, which is very distressing. The course is extremely slow, and patients feel uncomfortable and fall into neurasthenia. The most common cause of leukorrhea is infection, and the main one is gonorrhea. Therefore, women with leukorrhea should seek medical attention quickly to find out the cause. Once the cause is removed, the leukorrhea will be cured. If gonococci invade the uterine mucosa and cause endometritis, they will be lucky enough to conceive and implant in the uterine mucosa. However, after two or three months, a miscarriage will definitely occur. Many women in our country are infected with gonorrhea, but most are ashamed to seek medical treatment, which causes the gonococci to go upward and spread to cervicitis, endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, and peritonitis, and ultimately cannot become pregnant. Isn't that a big mistake? Now there is a very simple method that can cure both gonococcal leukorrhea and ordinary leukorrhea in the shortest possible time. The method is to buy two kinds of medicine, one for internal use and one for external use, and use them at the same time. Both internal and external application will achieve complete success. The two medicines are sold at the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, Shanghai. Those who have difficulty conceiving due to leukorrhea should give it a try. The hospital also has female doctors to assist in the diagnosis, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Red and White Leukorrhea</p>
<p>(Xiaoyun)</p>
<p>Red and white leukorrhea is a disease that is unique to women in our country. Not taking care of oneself during menstruation, improper postpartum care, and uncleanliness of washing products can all lead to diseases of the uterus. The result is increased inflammatory secretions. Mild cases are yellow-white and sticky, which is called leukorrhea. In severe cases, ulcers develop on the internal mucous membrane, and the superficial blood vessels are damaged. The secretions are mixed with blood, which is called red leukorrhea. Some are caused by tumors in the cervix, some are caused by venereal viruses, and some are caused by weakness and yellowing, as well as acute and chronic simple diseases of the genitourinary system. Since there are symptoms of red and white leukorrhea, there is a certain cause. However, women in our country are often ashamed to seek medical treatment, which leads to the progression of the disease and becomes incurable, which is a deep sigh. Now, the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, Shanghai, sells two kinds of medicine, "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine," which are very effective in treating women's gonococcal leukorrhea and simple red and white leukorrhea. It is the only self-treatment holy medicine for those who are ashamed to seek medical treatment and those who live in remote inland areas and lack good doctors and medicines. Women who suffer from this should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Evils of Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>(Qihong)</p>
<p>After contracting gonorrhea, if you do not pay attention to hygiene, it is easy to develop chronic gonorrhea. This chronic gonorrhea, on the surface, does not cause any physical pain. However, the bacteria will naturally increase day by day. During the incubation period, there is no feeling at all. But once it breaks out, the severity of the disease is several times more painful than when suffering from an acute disease. Moreover, the orchitis, prostatitis, lymphadenitis, and joint swelling caused by gonorrhea are extremely painful in the peak period. Even if the inflammation subsides, nodules often remain. If they are small, they will become inflamed at every turn. If they are severe, the organs will lose their effectiveness. The most obvious is that once you have had orchitis, it will hinder your ability to have children. Once the prostate is inflamed, symptoms such as premature ejaculation and impotence will continue to occur. Therefore, those who have gonorrhea should seek medical treatment early and cure it completely. Do not delay and cause trouble, or you will regret it too late. However, if the treatment is not appropriate, the harm will be even greater. That is why you must be careful in choosing a doctor. The Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, Shanghai, is a more reliable venereal disease hospital in Shanghai. It has experienced male and female doctors, complete electrotherapy equipment, and careful consideration during diagnosis and treatment. All of these are commendable.</p>
<p>Words from the Bottom of My Heart</p>
<p>(Naichang)</p>
<p>The lungs are the only important organ for breathing and are also an area that is easily invaded by germs. There are many people in our country who have lung diseases because tuberculosis bacteria are very contagious. Once infected, symptoms such as coughing, spitting blood, withering, and night sweats will occur. The ulceration of the lungs will also expand day by day, and the human body will not be able to support it. However, the initial symptoms of lung disease are very mild, so people often ignore it. Today, science is prosperous and X-rays can be used to fluoroscop the lungs. Any diseases can be seen at a glance. Now, the Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession is offering public lung health examinations at a very low cost. Therefore, gentry, merchants, and academics are coming to check in an endless stream. It is truly good news for the medical community.</p>
<p>X-ray Group Examination</p>
<p>(Zemin)</p>
<p>The Father and Son Hospital is famous for its perfect equipment and thorough treatment. The hospital's electrotherapy equipment is especially the best in the world. The machinery is all new and effective, and the experience in using it is rich. Therefore, those who have been treated with electricity will recover from their illnesses. Among them, the short-wave electrotherapy machine for the treatment of chronic white turbidity can be said to be unparalleled. The hospital also has X-ray group examinations. Individuals or groups who are suspected of having lung disease can go for examination at a very low cost. Due to the limited number of people, the X-ray examination time is set from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chatting About Vegetable Market Closures</p>
<p>Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the Public Works Department's Donation Office, the number of vegetable markets in the Public Concession has been declining in the past three years. In July 1934, there were 6,752 vegetable markets. By July 1935, there were only 6,534, a decrease of 218 from the previous year. In July of this year, there were only 5,992, a decrease of 760 from the year before last and a decrease of 542 from last year.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's development was truly amazing. The population was increasing day by day, and it was almost breaking the 4 million record. Land prices soared a thousand miles a day. Valuable land cost 100,000 to 200,000 per acre, and cheap land also cost tens of thousands or thousands. Construction was like a competition. If you built a twelve-story building, I would build a twenty-four-story building. This all indicated the prosperity of a big city.</p>
<p>However, the golden age cannot last long. Shanghai has been hit by the economic panic tide in recent years and has gradually declined. The announcement of the liquidation of banks and money houses is often heard. Large and small companies and stores also often fall one after another. Those who can barely maintain it must also hang the banner of "major price cuts" as a call. This is enough to see a glimpse of the industry's financial constraints.</p>
<p>In terms of residents' lives, a state of hardship is also fully revealing the dimness of Shanghai's situation. Although dance halls, movie theaters, and cafes show a mature atmosphere, this is just a manifestation of a few pleasure-seekers living in a drunken dream. Most people, the poor and the unemployed, must be complaining bitterly. Even ordinary families have to tighten their belts to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Not to mention anything else, the closure of vegetable markets is the best explanation. Of the three essential elements of life - clothing, food, and shelter - food is the most important. The vegetable market is the place that provides daily food and cannot stop trading for a day. However, the number of vegetable markets in the Public Concession of Shanghai has been declining in the past three years, just like the closure of stores. Last year, there were 218 fewer than the year before last, and this year there were 542 fewer than last year. It can be seen that people's lives are difficult.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to point out the reason for this. It is that the general residents are affected by the market depression, and life has to be simple. When the need is reduced, the supply will also be reduced accordingly. Not long ago, the price of pork rose, so the eating of meat was reduced. The price of tofu rose, so the eating of tofu was also reduced. This also makes the vegetable market deserted. If this continues,</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>the vegetable market in Shanghai will definitely continue to close in the future.</p>
<p>From the reduction of vegetable markets, we can also imagine that those who do business in oil, salt, firewood, and rice cannot have a good market. Extending this to general commerce, the decline is even more difficult to avoid. Then the recovery of Shanghai's prosperity will not be a recent event. The superficial embellishment may not be able to cover up the internal bleakness in the end.</p>
<p>Dongting Xishan Chengjin Coal Mine - Mine Area Pilgrimage</p>
<p>Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) Dongting Xishan stands alone in the 36,000 acres of vast Taihu Lake, and is one of the seventy-two strange peaks. The area is mostly mountainous and dangerous, with beautiful scenery, fertile soil, and a mild climate. The area is rich in resources, so it is very suitable for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The entire mountain area is vast, and there are many peaks, but the land is sparsely populated, and wasteland accounts for more than half. These wastelands are very suitable for growing tea and fruit, planting forests, and releasing bamboo. The mountain is rich in mineral resources. In addition to coal, stone, and ore, there are also iron ore, red clay, white clay, and other mines. Recently, a magnetite mine has been discovered in the eastern part of the mountain, and people are investing in trial mining. In addition, it is said that someone has discovered iron ore in the southern part of the mountain, but no one has explored it, so it is difficult to prove the amount. In short, if the mountain can be developed and planted, it will be a major source of wealth in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>The Xishan coal mine has been in existence for more than 30 years. As early as the 29th year of Guangxu in the Former Qing Dynasty, Luo Ganchang, a local villager, engaged in exploration and mining. In the first year of Xuantong, he officially obtained a license to start business. After the establishment of the Republic of China, he obtained a new license and expanded the mining area to ten square miles. In the eighth year of the Republic, he suspended work due to lack of funds. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, he presented to the former Ministry of Industry to continue the mining, but was suspended again due to the influence of the situation. In the winter of the twenty-first year, he opened up a new mining area of more than 27,000 acres, and discovered bituminous coal.</p>
<p>In the past, mining was done manually, and there were a total of nine mine entrances in the entire area, which was a huge waste. Some of the mine entrance projects have been completed, and some have not yet been completed. The deepest is 62 feet, and</p>
<h3>Tung Wah Society Triumphantly Wins: 9-2 Defeat Over St. Francis, Tai Lun-ching Scores Five Goals, Li Xu and Xue Each Contribute</h3>
<p>Tung Wah Football Club played against St. Francis team, newly promoted to Group A, at the municipal stadium yesterday in the Western Union Group A soccer match. The audience was only a meager six or seven hundred people, which was quite unexpected. After the kickoff, St. Francis showed great vigor, and Tung Wah was initially restrained. However, they soon suffered a setback. Tung Wah's lineup was well-organized, and as a result, Tung Wah won with a score of nine to two. The halftime score was four to one. The referee was Naisue. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Society</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Ning, Zhuang Weixin</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang, Feng Yunyou, Shu Shigeng</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Lun-ching, Xu Wenkui, Xue Wenxiu</p>
<p>St. Francis</p>
<p>Su Shi</p>
<p>A. Su Shi, Shi Dengge</p>
<p>Gailuoke, Pantersi, Jiehute</p>
<p>Qiaonaluo, Huilai, Botuo Xun, Mikekalun, Fuen</p>
<p>First Goal Conceded</p>
<p>After the whistle, St. Francis attacked first. Fuen advanced but was blocked by Shangxiang. Lun-ching dribbled the ball for an attack but was rejected and retreated. Wenxiu took a corner kick, but Yichen was slightly late, missing an excellent opportunity. Soon after, Tung Wah launched an all-out attack, and Li Ning also rushed to the front line to assist. Dai Lun-ching shot at the goal and scored, but it was ruled offside. Yichen also attempted a shot from twenty yards, but it was caught. The opponent took advantage of the extremely empty area in Tung Wah's defense. Qiaonaluo went straight in alone. Zhuang Weixin chased desperately, resulting in a corner kick. Tung Wah escaped danger and then had a corner kick opportunity. Yichen's header was caught. Fuen dribbled forward and passed to Mikekalun. Li Ning intercepted but slipped. The ball rolled in front of Tung Wah's goal. Huilai caught up and kicked it in, hitting the post. Tung Wah conceded a goal first, only eight minutes after the start of the game.</p>
<p>Four Goals in a Row</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes, Tung Wah launched a full-scale attack. Xu Wenkui scored first, tying the score at one to one. After several rounds, Xu Wenkui broke through and passed to Yichen, who took a fierce shot, low and fast. It hit Su Shi and bounced into the net (2-1). At this point, Tung Wah's momentum was even stronger, especially Wan Xianghua. Good opportunities came one after another. Xianghua sent the ball to the front of the goal. Lun-ching took the shot and scored again (3-1). Tung Wah's defense encountered danger. Huilai advanced rapidly, Zhuang lost his footing, and Qiaonaluo shot quickly. Rongcai rushed out and was knocked to the ground by Huilai. Fortunately, he was agile and jumped up to save the dangerous situation. Shangxiang got the ball and passed it to the front line. Wenkui dribbled slightly and shot sharply, scoring (4-1). St. Francis launched a counterattack once. Mikekalun's shot failed. At lemon time, Tung Wah led by four to one.</p>
<p>Unstoppable</p>
<p>The second half began, and Tung Wah was now against the wind. St. Francis took advantage of the situation to press forward. Qiaonaluo and Fuen shot successively, but Zhang Rongcai saved them all. After that, Tung Wah surrounded the opponent's goal, raining shots like bullets, but none were successful. At eight minutes, St. Francis was penalized a penalty. Yichen took the penalty and hit the crossbar and went in (5-1). After that, St. Francis gradually became active again, launching counterattacks many times. Botuo Xun stole the ball in the midst of chaos. Rongcai did not pay attention. Fortunately, the ball went out along the post.</p>
<p>Making it Nine to One</p>
<p>Although Tung Wah controlled the overall situation, they were somewhat careless because they had already secured the victory, which led to missed opportunities in front of the goal. At the quarter hour mark, Wenxiu passed the ball to Lun-ching. Tai jumped into the air and scored again after hitting the crossbar and going in (6-1). Not long after, they added another goal, making it 7-1. Tung Wah's luck was running high, and good opportunities came one after another. A few minutes later, the ball went to Wenkui's feet again, who passed it far to the front of the goal. Lun-ching shot low, making it 8-1. The greatest credit for this goal goes to Wenxiu. In the blink of an eye, Wenxiu went straight in alone. He kicked it in without passing, very clearly (9-1). At this time, both sides were exhausted.</p>
<p>Careless Loss of Ground</p>
<p>Fuen used to be a cornerstone of St. Francis, but yesterday he was in very poor condition, missing opportunities repeatedly and becoming discouraged. Tung Wah, seeing the enemy's laziness and knowing that the outcome had already been decided, became too careless. Unexpectedly, St. Francis suddenly launched an all-out attack. Botuo attacked fiercely twice. Huilai cut out from the side and passed to the right. Mikekalun seized the opportunity to shoot successfully. Not long after, the silver whistle sounded, and Tung Wah won with a score of nine to two.</p>

<p>The Grass Tennis Junior Singles, organized by the Grass Tennis Club of this city, Luo Min'e against Master, and the Women's Doubles, Mrs. Ma'er, Mrs. Button against Mrs. Gan Zhi and Miss Andelai, held the finals at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon one after another. Hundreds of spectators came to watch, and the situation was enthusiastic. As a result, Little Luo lived up to expectations, defeating the enemy in straight sets and winning the championship. In the Women's Doubles, Mrs. Ma'er and Mrs. Button cooperated perfectly, winning the championship with a score of two to zero. Little Luo's skills have recently reached perfection, being quiet like a virgin and moving like a rabbit. During the battle, he was calm beyond compare. Long shots from the baseline often led to the enemy's demise. Master's skills were no less than Little Luo's, but he showed some panic in the face of battle, which was the biggest reason for his failure. In the first set, the two did not give way to each other, and the ball went back and forth, resulting in a tie. The score was tight at five to five. Little Luo was eager to win and took a diagonal shot. Ma was caught off guard and lost two consecutive games to Little Luo, winning the first set. In the second set, Master was already in a panic, no longer as calm as in the first set. Little Luo launched a fierce attack, and Ma could do nothing about it, struggling hard to barely achieve a tie of four and four. Not long after, Little Luo's arrogance returned, and he swung his left arm, killing Master without any chance to fight back, losing two consecutive games. In the last set, Master was already at the end of his rope, still fighting like a trapped beast. Little Luo was about to achieve success at the last moment, so he would not let go. He used both wisdom and courage in one go, and won the last set with seven to five, winning the championship. In the Women's Doubles final, Mrs. Ma'er and Mrs. Button won with a score of two to one, winning the championship.</p>

<h3>Lin Baohua Carson, Performance in Beijing, Lin's Performance is Excellent</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) Hu Lin Baohua and Carson performed with Beijing players Ma Shaobo and Li Pi at the Beijing Amateur Association on the 27th. More than a thousand spectators came to watch. Lin and Ka's doubles defeated Ma and Li 7-5, 6-2. In the first set, the two sides were evenly matched, with many exciting moments. In singles, Carson narrowly defeated Lin Baohua 2-1. Lin's performance today was excellent, with long shots and short hits all coming easily. Carson was always on the defensive. In the third set, Lin once took the lead 4-2.
