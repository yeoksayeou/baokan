<h3>國聯大會開幕</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>國聯大會今日在日內瓦開幕了这次大會所要討論的問題最可注意的大的就是修改盟的罷盟的為什麽要提出修改呢因為國聯用這工具對意國施了經濟制裁沒有發生什麽效力而意國佔領阿比西尼亞以後國際的嚴重的形勢反使國聯諸會員國不得不用可恥的形式來取銷制裁于是有些會員國感覺到修改盟的的必要了其實國聯的孱弱無能在日本佔領我們東北四省的時候早就有了充分的暴露而且這也是國聯的本質所决定的原來國聯是勝利的和平主義的產物其實際的權力不在本身部在各會員國的政府而各會員國的政治制度和民族觀念又是十分矛盾複雜的國聯的本質旣然如此恐怕修改了盟的也不見得就會使它堅强起來罷但是在今日的世界大戰的危機已經臨頭了國聯這一個和平機構總究還是那些主張維持國際的安全與和平的國家所要竭力擁護的我們不妨對它留着一綫的希望贊成它把修改盟的當作起死回生的方劑來嘗試一次</p>
<p>我國政府所建議的關于修改盟的的意見如下（一）盟的十一條所載防止戰爭辦法　盡量充實侵略國定義應切實規定關于防止戰爭辦法可不必經行政院全體一致通過即當實行（二）關于盟的第十六條所載各項制裁辦法主張設立專家常任委會製就長久有效的條文使制裁辦法得以自動立卽完全實施（三）設立特種委員會預先决定緊急時所當採取的軍事制裁辦法</p>
<p>這項建議通過大會的可能性如何姑且不論總之這是針對着盟的的最大缺點而提出修改的現在的盟的條文的確太籠統了盟的所規定的種種制裁手續的確也太迂緩了要是阿比西尼亞的侵略戰爭跟英法等國沒有切身的利害關係恐怕他們甚至可以使國聯不會判定意大利是侵略國罷對意經濟制裁不發生效力顯然也是因為迂緩的手續耽誤了時機的綠故未來的國際戰爭在性質上一定比上决大戰慘酷得多在戰略上一定也比上决大戰迅速得多國聯要對侵略國加以有效的制裁當然非十分迅速地來執行不可所以國聯盟的照我國政府所建議那樣來修改一下實在是必要的</p>

<h3>怎樣提倡農村副業（中）</h3>
<p>— 中央農業實驗所副所長錢天鶴</p>
<p>現在我們的耕地，儘管感覺不足，但依然還有廢棄的空地。這不是矛盾的現象？不，因為這種空地，不是種莊稼不易茂盛，所得不償所失，便是地方太小，不情願去耕種。前者如荒山河灘等，後者如路旁及四周的隙地等。譬如這種地方，我們利用去栽種蓖麻，這蓖麻不擇土地的肥瘦，並目儘可　放，而蓖麻油市場很需要，不特用作藥料，工業上應用，亦一天多似一天，最短期內决不會過剩，所以是農民很好的生財之路。這就是提倡農村副業的第三種原因。（四）農產品的加工　怎麽呌農產品的加工？我們舉一個顯明的例，譬如棉花是農產品，經過紡織，就變成紗和布，這紡織就呌加工。我們　得，有許多農產物如菓蔬等，一時賣不掉就要腐敗，假使能够加工製造，或用鹽漬，或製成罐頭，運銷市塲，就可多　筆收入，葡萄乾一般人都吃過，不過大都是外國貨，那末為什麽我國很適宜栽培的不儘量的栽培呢？其最大的緣故，就是大家不設法加工製造。米麥豐收成災，是我國普通的現象，如果能加工製造成酒，酒可以賣錢，酒糟可以喂家畜，家畜又可以賣錢，過剩的勞力旣可利用，收入亦可增加不少，稻草是燃料，假如加工織成草鞋，或搓成草繩，其經濟價値，亦必增加不少。還有許多農產品，本來不值什麽錢，但經過加工後，價値就會陡增幾倍，譬如草帽，牠的原料是很賤的，但製成以後，便可賣到每頂一元至數十元不等。所以農產品可以加工或値得加工的去加工，亦是很好的農村副業。這就是要提倡農村副業的第四種原因。</p>
<p>（五）挽回漏卮　我國自從和外國通商以後，洋貨就漸漸的佔有我國的市塲，當初是僅限於大城市，近年以來因公路發達及其他種種原因，洋貨逐漸深入到農村裏去，不但原有的土貨被其打倒，農村間少了這　收入，並且農民多了一筆耗費，加速了他的破產。根據中央農業實騐所第四卷第八期農情報吿所載，據二十四年四月，全國二十二省六千餘農情報吿員之報吿：購用洋布之農家，佔全體農民百分之三十，服用毛織品的為全數之九·六，二十二省平均每一中等農家每年需用洋糖六·八斤，煤油二七·三斤，以上種種用品，從前都能自供自給，現在却要仰賴洋貨，每年有這樣很大的損失，農村怎能小破產，國家怎能不困窮呢？</p>
<p>再有許多土貨，我國原來有的，何以會被洋貨排擠，這到不是國民愛用外國貨，實在是因為土貨不緊牢，不美觀，或價値太高。所以現在能一方面把原有土貨加以改良，使牠堅牢美觀，使牠比洋貨更便宜，銷路自然可以慢慢復興。如無錫的泥人，是很出名的，但除無錫以外，其他的城市，就不容易見到牠的踪跡，所看見的都是外國用化學材料製成的人物鳥獸，旣美觀，又價廉，所以銷路很好。這是什麽道理呢？就是無錫做泥人的人不肯硏究改良，多變花樣，力求美觀和價廉，以及注意推銷方法。無錫做泥人的人們，如能一面力圖改進，一面設法打開銷路，我們相信一定可以減少一部分進口的兒童玩具。再有許多新副業，因市塲需要，可以提倡而能見效的，例如日本每年輸出外國的金魚有四百萬尾，值銀五十萬元；尤其在美國，銷路最廣，因美國人有錢，而金魚又非常好玩，所以這種好生意，就被聰明的日本人完全佔去了，但我國則對於這　副業，到現在尚少有人注意到。又如北平燕京大學敎授的太太們，利用織夏布的原料敎導北平鄉間婦女織各種式的台布台氈，道種台布台氈，西洋人非常歡喜，差不多到該校去參觀的，都要買幾條帶回去。但這種合乎西洋人心理的台布台氈，如上海等地西洋人多的地方却沒有推銷處。如果「江西四川等省原來出夏布的地方，利用農民的過　時間和勞力，提倡織台布台氈，除供給在中國的西洋人及所謂高等華人購用外，更可推銷到西洋，這不是可以挽回若干的漏巵嗎？這就是要提倡農村副業的第五種原因。</p>
<p>為什麽要提倡農村副業，五種原因已經說過，不過概括首之，都是為着　民增加收入而已。因為國家的基礎，是建築在農民身上，農民生計不富裕，國家也萬難富强呀！</p>
<p>三·怎樣提倡農村副業</p>
<p>（一）提倡農村副業的先决條件：</p>
<p>（甲）要能和工業界切實聯絡　這個標題，驟視之似乎難了解，其實很簡單，現在卽舉幾個例來說明：譬如蠶絲，農民養蠶，將繭賣給絲廠繅絲，已有多年的歷史。但前幾年絲價慘跌，許多絲廠關門，農民辛辛苦苦收到的繭子，賣錢太少，感覺得不償失，有許多農民就發恨把桑樹砍掉不再養蠶。而去年忽當絲價飛漲，絲廠都齊開了，但原料缺乏，一部分絲　仍舊只好關門。這種情形，固然是受世界經濟的影響，但彼此失掉聯絡，亦是一個最大的原因。又如火柴的盒子，火柴廠大都是包給城市裏的苦人家做的，城市裏苦人家的生活程度高，火柴廠所給的工價低，因之，呌苦連天，怨聲載道，若委託農村做，則鄉村生活程度低，農民又可利用餘暇，而人又來得多，工　既不需增高，而出品却可迅速；農民方面旣有了安定的副業，又可得一定的收入，眞是雙方都有利益。所以我們要提倡副業，要能和工業界聯絡的。</p>
<p>（乙）要適合市塲需要並有擴充銷路的可能性我們提倡農村副業，一定要看這種副業的產品，是不是適合市塲需要，並有沒有擴充銷路的可能性。譬如織土布這種副業，現在土布的市場已被洋布及機織布侵佔，我們猶盲目的提倡，當然是要失敗。又如蓖麻油，現在市塲需要很切，我們竭力提倡栽培蓖麻，以供應需求，當然只有獲利。這就是前者不合乎市塲需要，後者合乎市塲需要的結果。再如產鹽區域的編織蒲包，這蒲包是專用以裝鹽的，我們以為每年裝鹽所用的蒲包數量很多，就大加提倡編織，出品是增多了，　除掉裝鹽之外，其他因交通不便，推銷沒有組織等等緣故，沒有銷路，　種提倡一定要失敗。但如製造紙傘，這紙傘近年來不特暢銷國內，就是出口也一天多似一天，這種副業，我們加以提倡和改進，希望就很大。這就是前者銷路狹難有擴充性，後者銷路廣有擴充性的實例。</p>

<h3>英日親善之可能性</h3>
<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>近月來，英日親善之呼聲，甚囂塵上。上月初旬，東京更盛傳英國霍爾海相已擬定英日妥協方案：（一）英國承認「滿洲國」及日本在華北之特殊地位，（二）日本尊重中國之領土完整，維持門戶開放原則及英國在華旣得權利。此項消息，雖經倫敦當局否認，但觀於日本駐英大使吉田茂氏最近在英京之大肆活動與倫教人士之言論，英日親善，雖尙未至成熟時期，而雙方俱已有意於兩國關係之調整，似確為不可掩之事實。近日英國駐華新大使許芝森爵士於赴任途中，繞道訪日，會晤日方外交當局，商談英日問題及中日外交問題之舉，更足資為明證。吾人倘就兩國過去之關係與目前之國際情勢觀察，英日親善之可能性究屬若何，當不難窺見也。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時，英日本為同盟國家。當時日本之羽毛未豐，正力圖向外發展而苦無後盾，英國之遠東勢力方受舊俄之威脅，雖欲抵抗而不願自我犧牲，於是互相利用而締結同盟以打倒其共同敵人。然舊俄戰敗而後，日本卽代之而興，政治上擴張廣大之領地，軍事上增加雄厚之力量，產業上更有甚大之進展，於是資本主義之基礎因以確立。歐戰以後，日本在產業上商業上更有驚人之成就，予英國在遠東之經濟勢力以極大打擊。在澳洲·印度·加拿大·中國·南洋等地，英日兩國在商務上莫不處於正面衝突之地位。廿年來，明爭暗鬥，無時或巳，而所謂英日同盟者，僅足為歷史上之陳蹟而巳。九一八日本獨佔東省以後，去年復進窺冀察，造成其在華北之特殊地位。於是英國在華之經濟勢力受進一步之壓迫，所謂特殊貿易之走私無孔不入，而日本在華南及長江流域之對英經濟戰更著著進逼，使英國感覺在華勢力不特受極大之威脅，且有根本動搖之可慮。處此情勢之下，如欲强硬對日以保持其在華之固有地位，則以歐陸和平方因法西斯國家之氣焰高張而杌隍不安，對於遠東問題，事實上無暇顧及。英國處此苦悶之中，一年來遂亟圖打開此種對峙之局面。</p>
<p>然則打開此種對峙局面之道為何？曰：或為對日妥恊，或為英蘇携手。去年九月間，英國經濟專員李滋羅斯爵士來華考察經濟狀况，助我改革幣制，同時對於英日關係之調整，亦曾懷有滿腔之熱望。乃當時日本獨佔中國之慾念正日益抬頭，故羅斯在華半戰，兩度訪日，備受日方朝野之冷嘲熱諷，不得不廢然而返，對於英日關係，始終未見有何改善。然失之東隅，不妨收之桑楡，英蘇携手亦足為日本無上之威脅。以今日之局勢較諸日俄戰爭時，日俄之地位，顯已互易，是今日英國之聯俄制日，亦可謂事理所必然；故英蘇之間，頻年來雖因國體之絕不相容，以致始終隔閡，英國且曾領導全世界之反蘇聯陣綫，而由於英日矛盾之漸趨深刻，衝突之日益尖銳，與妥協之希望微渺，遂不得不改弦易轍，急謀改善。於是醞釀數月之英蘇借欵協定與英蘇海軍協定，忽於七月底急轉直下，在英國絕大　步之下宜告成立。前者為英蘇經濟諒解合作之先聲，後者承認蘇俄對遠東之保留條件，予蘇俄在遠東方面得以自由應付之權，弦外之音，直不啻說明英國之勢將後助蘇俄以對抗日本也</p>
<p>英蘇携手，旣告端緒，東京人士，乃深感英國對日之漸趨硬化，足使日本在外交上孤立更甚。有田外相之迭次聲明，頗露焦急之態，於是日本輿論界高唱英日親善之論調，而吉田茂大使乃大肆活動於英京。然日本此種對英親善之空氣，不見於羅斯一再訪日之時而見於今日者，雖因英蘇携手對日硬化之故，而同時最近中國之趨於眞正統一之局面，與政治經濟建設之漸上軌道，實亦為重要之因素。蓋時至今日，中國之眞正統一旣巳完成，則日本之對華態度急宜明白確立；獨佔束亞旣不可能，則兩國關係之急須調整，殆屬必然之理。日本有識之士，多已注意及此，故有重行確立對華政策之呼聲，而駐華川越大使到任之後，盛倡中日經濟提携之論，有田外相亦承認强調「經濟外交」之必要，是今後日本之對華政策，乃自軍事方面轉向外交方面，自政治方面轉向經濟方面。明乎此，則日本對於英日在華之利害衝突，由於此種新局面之展開，勢必力謀於此時求一合理解决之途徑。</p>
<p>顧英國之態度又屬若何？其將始終以英蘇携手共制日本為一貫之政策歟？是又不然。夫外交手腕本屬多方面的；而英國外交叉向隨環境轉移，以圓滑著稱，且英國在華僅欲保持其固有之經濟勢力不受威脅而巳，本月八日英國駐華新大使許芝森爵士在東京答中央社記者問，亦堅稱：「英國在中國最大之利益厥為保持和平與貿易，故凡足使中國一部份引起紛擾及不安者，英國均將認為碍及英國該項利益一。等語，日本倘能於此方面予以相當滿意，則兩國關係，當無不能暫時妥協之理。易言之，問題之中心，實為日本對英經濟戰之能吾讓步而已。惟日本近年來在產業上之驚人進展，迫其必須覓取國外市塲以傾銷其過剩之商品，亦自有其不得不然之苦衷，卽日印日　等商戰之愈形激烈，亦屬良非得已，對英讓步之可能與吾，事實上猶為疑間。綜上以觀，英日親善之可能性究屬若何，將視日本對於英國在遠東之經濟勢力究能予以若干保障，亦卽日本對於英國在經濟上究有幾許讓步為斷耳。</p>

<h3>兩廣最近概況（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者笑庵</p>
<p>粤桂局面更新之後，民財黨軍諸端，復歸中央，過去數年之西南，一切組織，完全告終，今後粤桂兩省，固急待新政之建設，卽兩省民衆，期待休養生息，亦復甚切，故粤桂兩省目下狀况，自為國人所關懷，記者爰有粤桂之行，茲就見聞所得，分記如次。</p>
<p>由上海至廣州</p>
<p>上海香港間人士之往還，素恃郵船為捷征，以行程晝兩夜，可以達也，數年以來，各郵船在滬港間營業情况，以美國之大來公司與英國之昌典公司為最佳，法德意等國郵船公司次之，日本郵船公司，則最下矣，所以然者，九一八事變發生，日本郵船營業，實受甚大影響，查日本郵船，龍田淺間秩父三號，構造甚新，載重達二萬噸以上，客票較大來昌興兩公司為廉，就以三等房位論，大來昌興為美金十五元，日本則為美金十元，乃日本郵船營業成績，獨未見佳，此可思過半矣，據聞近數年間，日本郵船公司，以營業不佳，所賴以存者，厥為其政府發給之救濟金，藉資補助，但自八月十日起，日本郵船客票，已由美金十元减為美金八元，其意在於貶價招徠生意，以圖客貨起色，而减輕其政府救濟之責，但大來昌興兩公司，以日本郵船减價，因亦自本月份起，三等客票，由美金十五元减為十二元，以與日本郵船抗衡，於此足見日本商務環境之一班。</p>
<p>記者由滬乘輪南下，輪中所見，有窮老之華僑數名，又有由東京歸國鎭日穿和服之學生多人，餘無可記，與記者同房間者，有中山大學張君某兼指揮部參謀符君，兩晝夜間，斗室長談，彌感快愉，符君會參與長城抵日與皖南勦匪諸役，對於當時戰略，多所貢獻，至今談及長城之役，彼此猶不勝欷獻，符君為黃埔學校出身，文才武略，均屬擅長，詳堪膺佩，輪抵香港，停靠九龍碼頭，該處密邇廣九鐵路，尖沙嘴車站，記者與符張二君，乃相的乘車赴廣州，不復在香港勾留，但香港碼頭工人與所謂「雜差」，（卽警探之別稱）對於來往人士之行李，每每公然施以敲詐勒索等不道德行為，記者與符張二君，行李合併一處，數量自較略多，遂亦遭彼華敲詐勒索，此種事實，殊為英國文明政治下之汚點，英國政府宜速澈禁之也。</p>
<p>廣九鐵路快車，每日上下行各開三次，由廣州開者，上午八時十五分為飛鷹快車，中午一時十分為中午快車，下午四時五十分為飛龍快車，由香港開者，上午八時三十分為飛箭快車，中午十二時四十五分為中午快車，下午五時零五分為飛星快車，全錢票價，由廣州往港，收粤省法幣三等為一元四角，由港往廣州，收香港紙幣，三等為一元，蓋港粤幣乃為十與十四之比，其餘二等頭等客票，均依照加倍計算，記者以下午乘飛星快車赴廣州，廣九鐵路，由港至深圳，是為英段，深圳至廣州是為華段，英段沿錢，英人多闢有公路，雖其村落，悉為中國式，而其佈置，則深具洋化，港人稱其間為「新界」，卽示為港政府新佔領之意，深圳為中英交界區域，地方軍警之管理，較為寬疏，該地遂變為藏垢納汚之窟，烟賭娼三毒，固悉薈萃，內地盜匪，亦以該處為逃逋藪，烟賭未施禁時，該處賭塲之最著名者，為「又生公司」，乃廣州裕德賭博公司所分設，資本達百餘萬元，舉凡番攤，牌九，輪盤，骰子等雜賭，無不具備，該公司又建有戲院烟店等，以引誘賭徒，其遺禍人羣，良堪痛恨，當車停深圳站時，遙望賭塲戲院酒店等建築物，綠瓦粉牆，以及由車站直達賭塲戲院酒店等處之路燈，均倣故宮式，但十分粗俗耳，越深圳前行，村落甚為稠密，惟每一村落，必有碉樓數座，矗立於村之、前後左右或其中央，氣勢頗為雄壯，允以平湖樟木頭石龍各站附近為多，查石龍為粤省大市鎭之一，亦束江出入之要道，而東江民性，素稱為百粤之强，瞻彼壁壘，可以想見，八時許，車抵廣州之大沙頭站。</p>
<p>廣九路局，年來極力宣稱發展路務，但三等車廂秩序，深憾未能完善，大抵最令人憎厭者，莫如呌賣食物之市儈，有手持雲片糕僅三數包，來往呌賣達二十餘次，呌賣龍眼沙梨汽水者，亦復如是，致車內極為嘈雜，至於物價，更覺奇昂，汽水每瓶售港洋一角四分，蓋等諸華幣小洋二角，且呌賣食物之輩，衣履不潔，水菜皮壳等殘餘物，又盡棄諸乘客之前，是允足予人以不良印象客票於開車後，查騐一次，過深圳後，又查騐一次，過石龍後，則由騐票員收去，故車到達廣州大沙頭車站，乘客紛紛下車，車站已無收票之手續，是時閒雜人等，集於月台看閙熱者乃甚多，汽車夫及搬運行李之工人等，亦逕進月台，此為與京滬鐵路車站的組織不相同處也。（九月十六日自廣州寄）</p>

<h3>上海　日本學校概況（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>二，校舍與設備</p>
<p>日本學校的校舍共有六所；因為實業靑年學校的校舍是附在北部日本尋常小學校校舍的裏面。各校校舍的建築，面積和敎室的數目均有不同，現在將各校舍建築的情况調查抄錄如后：</p>
<p>上海日本學校校舍建築概况表</p>
<p>附註：一坪的等於三十六方尺</p>
<p>各校特殊敎室的種類與間數略有差別，現將中部尋常小學校的特殊體室分別列出，俾可見其一斑。該校七間特殊敎室是：手了敎室一問，理科敎窒一間，作法室一間，栽縫室一間，圖晝室一間，唱歌室二間。其他各室是：手室準備室，手工材料室，理科準備室，標本掛圖室，衛生工，職員圖書室，兒　讀書室，武道具室，運動具室，浴室，應接室等。</p>
<p>日本高等女學校另有中式，和式，四式烹飪實騐室一大間，茶儀實習窒二間，西式和式作法室各一間，染衣實習室一間。去歲新建游泳池一所，在暑期中開放為全滬各日校男女學生練習游泳之用。最近中部尋常小學校亦在興建游泳池一所，為小學兒童練習游泳之用。</p>
<p>三、行政設施</p>
<p>前節已經說過，上海日本學校是由上海日本居留民團所設立，所以各校管理權均操於居留民團幹部人員的手中。居留民團團長名義上負管理學校的責任，實際上則由學務委員會主持。學務委員會委員係由團長聘任的，向團長負責。關於校舍的興建，經費的　劃與管理均由學務委員會策劃進行。</p>
<p>各校職敎員的聘請，係由日本文部省（即敎育部）將候選人介紹到外務省（卽外交部）·外務省將候選人名單　交上海總領事，總領事在候選人名單中選擇任命。校長則由外務省　請日皇直接任命，所以校長是奏任官。</p>
<p>校中的一切訓敎事項係由校畏全權處理。各校除校長外，另設副校長一人，襄助處理校中訓敎事項。副校長遇校長請假時可代理校長職務；校長吿老時，副校長可升任校長·在小學校中，每校均聘有經過政府檢定的看護婦一人，主持校中的兒童衛生健康事宜。</p>
<p>各校的行政有一特點可以提出的，就是有計劃地工作。每校在三月間制定下年度的工作計劃；在每月終制定下月的工作計劃；在每週末制定下週的工作計劃。每日的工作分三次進行：（一）每日上課前的工作：發出兒童出席記載簿，注意校中佈吿，値日員視察校舍內外，監護兇童安全，準備敎學用具，出席職員會議，巡視祖任敎室。（二）每日放學後的工作：監督指導値日生，報吿學生出缺席，注意校中佈告，處理兒童成績物，研究指導材料，預定明日工作，視察校舍內外，課外指導及作業指導，處理分掌的事務，研究及修養。（三）一日中的工作：施行朝會禮，領導兒童集合與散隊，檢查出缺席兒童並記載，處理疾病兒童，施行學習指導，勸行訓練方針，應用學習用具，看護兒童，指導兒童午膳。</p>
<p>四、經費收支</p>
<p>上海日本學交的經費收支是由居留民團處理的，居留民團的收支張目及票據文件等每年由稽核委員會稽核四次。稽核委員會有專家委員七人，是由居留民全體常年大會中推選的。稽核委員會將糟核結果呈報上海日本總領事審核。每屆會計年度的决算書亦須呈報居留民全體常年大會曁總領事核准。</p>
<p>各校所收學費標準規定如下：</p>
<p>小學校：初高兩級——免費</p>
<p>小學校：高等兩班（初中一二年）——每月一元</p>
<p>高等女學校每月五元</p>
<p>高等女學校職業科每月八元</p>
<p>實業靑年學校每月一元</p>
<p>商業學校每月五元</p>
<p>各校的經費預算均由居留民團編掣。現將一九三六年</p>

<h3>法郎跌價與吾國外匯之穩定</h3>
<p>— 蔣潔</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>最近法國政府因禁止軍火運往西班牙，引起人民陣綫的反感，一時工潮復作，政局動盪，致影饗法郎地位，復吿危急。九月七日法郎賣風驟熾，對英滙價大跌，計自本月初的每英鎊合七六，四三法郎，跌至十七日的七六，九四法郎，在法郎而言，這是本年以來的最低價，同時資金逃避，人心恐慌，本月九日及十一日，黃金流往美國者共値二一，〇〇五，〇〇〇美元，流往英國者尙未見統計，但據倫敦電訊，日來英倫銀行收入的法人存金，日見增多。</p>
<p>這次法郎的跌價，表面雖由政潮工潮所引起，實則另有其根本之原因在。由於近年各國劇烈的貨幣貶値競爭，山於法國堅持金本位以來的空前經濟危難，由於戰爭空氣所造成的財政恐慌，俱根本的使法郎平價難於維持，祗要一受政局的波動，或者投機的襲學，恐慌便立時發生，本年以來，已有四次之多。以今日歐洲政局的動盪，此後法郎恐慌的層見疊出更是可以斷言的，論者或謂法郎跌價係暫時性質，祇要政潮工潮一解决，法郎便歸寗息，這樣看法，未免忽略了法郎危機的基本因。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>由於法郎的動搖，歐洲金融市塲上大量拋出法郎，購進英鎊，因而使英鎊的需求激增，匯價堅挺。英美匯率便在這種情形底下，連帶漲起，計自本月初的每英鎊合五·〇三二五美元，漲至十七日的五·〇六五六二五美元·在英鎊而言，這是本年以來的最高價·本年二月問美元會一度下跌，英美匯率昇至五·〇二六二五，比了現行匯率，也還不逮甚遠。</p>
<p>這積情形，顯然遠反英國的鎊價漸减政策，對於英國是十分不利的。所以法郎一起恐慌，英國平準基金處便出而維持，一則使英法滙率不致過份上昇，一則使英美匯率回落下來，可是這一次英國維特的效果，到十七日為止，還沒有顯著的成功。法郎價格祇在十日有輕微的回昇，此後依然低落下來。美匯亦同此情形，詳見下表：</p>
<p>英法匯率　英美匯率</p>
<p>每英鎊合法郎數　每英鎊合美元數</p>
<p>九月一日　七六·四三　五·三二五</p>
<p>七日　七六·五六　五·〇四一二五</p>
<p>八日　七六·七五　五·〇五五</p>
<p>九日　七六·八三　五·〇五八七五</p>
<p>十日　七六·七八　五·〇五五</p>
<p>十一日　七六·八四　五·〇五八七五</p>
<p>十二日　七六·八四　五·〇五八七五</p>
<p>十四日　七六·八四　五·〇六一二五</p>
<p>十五日　七六·九一　五·〇六五</p>
<p>十六日　七六·九〇　五·○六二五</p>
<p>十七日　七六·九四　五·〇六五二五</p>
<p>從上表可以看出法郎現貨價格的變動：而此時法郎的遠期價格也十分敎弱，這更足以反映出法郎前途的暗淡。</p>
<p>在現時英鎊美元法郎的三角關係中間，英國要想維護法郎，而使鎊價相對的低洛是十分艱難的。因為法郎的基礎根本是脆弱的。各方加於法郎的拋賣壓力，並非全出於投機作用，而係大量法郎現貨的交易。恐慌期間固然賣風甚熾，俟恐慌過後，低舊絡續拋售，不過略為和緩而已，所以法郎匯價的趨勢根本是向下的，並非英國平準基金處所能改善。英鎊處此環境，此後價格只有日見高漲，而英法，英美間的匯率無疑是上昇的。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>英法匯率的繼變動，對於吾國貨幣關係尙小，而英美匯率漲起之結果，我國貨幣的對外匯率便直接受其影響。本來中國貨幣在改制之初，與英鎊相聯繫，國幣一元穩定於一先令二便士半，而國幣白元等於美金二九·七五元，則係由英美匯兌套算而得。公式如下：</p>
<p>假如英美匯率不變，則吾國的對英對美匯率，處於平衡狀態，可以穩定下去。但近來英美匯率常常變動甚劇，譬如本年二月間，英美匯率昇至五·〇二六二五，這時中國貨幣的對外匯率假如不變，則在對英與對美之間便發生了矛盾，投機者可以在上海用套匯的方法，坐獲巨利。方式如下：</p>
<p>用套匯方法獲得之利益·（註一）</p>
<p>所以中國必須在歷低英匯與抬高美匯二者之間擇一而行。在當時，中國揀的是後一法，把中美匯率由中國百元合美金二九·七五元，昇至三〇·二五元，中英匯率　維持原狀。</p>
<p>現在英美匯率再度昇高，則自本年二月以來的對英一先令　便士半與對美三十元左右的匯率，在二者之間又起了矛盾，其情形可謂與上次並無二致，而吾國應付的方法則不同。</p>
<p>這次中央銀行的法定匯率並沒有變更，而實際的賣價與買價却改變了。九月九日中英銀行經理席德懋氏發表聲明，謂中央銀行奉財長指令，將對外匯況的法定價格與買賣價格間的差額增大，以前對英差額為八分之一，對美為四分之一，對日為一仙，此後變為對英四分之一，對美二分之一，對日二仙，以防止本埠市塲的套利投機。同時據作者調查，中央銀行的英鎊賣價為一先令二便士又四分之一，買價為一先令二便士又四分之三，美元賣價為美金二十九元半，買價為三十元半。</p>
<p>法定匯價祇是一種標識，觀察實務的人應以銀行賣價為準，今以賣價而論，吾國貨幣價格比從前要略為降低了。中央銀行的每日賣價沒有刋載，這裏列出匯豐銀行的每日賣價來，它和中央銀行賣價的趨勢是相同的。</p>
<p>滙豐銀行每日匯價行市</p>
<p>（註）英滙價中國一元等於英鎊敎美滙中國百尤等於　元數日匯價中國百元等於日元數法匯價中國百元等於法郎數</p>
<p>從最近幾個月的匯價變遷來觀察，吾國外滙的穩定是十分顯著的，最大的變動，也不超過百分之一·一，變動雖很經微，却是普通的。九月九日以前，鎊滙尙穩立不動，九日以後鎊匯也變動了。可知新貨制度並不是鎊滙本位制，而中英匯率也並非、成不變的。</p>
<p>把這一次外匯變動的內容來分析，對　滙率的穩定是値得注意的，據滙豐行市，英，日，决，滙率都動了，而美滙不動，恰和本年一月間，英匯不動，美滙放長的情形相反，這一點可以和中美銀協定的訂立事件，連擊起來考盧一下。還有一點値得注意者，这次對英，對日的滙率變動，都是把吾國貨幣的價格降低的，作者以為此舉對於吾國的貿易是有利的，並且此後還該採取漸進的低滙政策，漸進的低匯政策有利於貿易而無碍於金融的穩定。</p>
<p>現在可以知道國際貨幣的變動是　然會影響到吾團的匯兌情形的，這不僅吾國如此，任何國家無不如此，現代的國際金融交織連繫，不可分斯，沒有一個國家可以孤立起來不受其他主要國家的影響。所以影響是當然的，問題在於我國匯價的變動，能否以我國的利益為依歸。假如能够，則雖受影響，仍不失其貨幣的自主權，好像英國。假如不能，則受害無窮。</p>
<p>在今日各國以匯兌政策作為經濟戰爭的工具的時代，吾國必須保全這個最後的壁壘。</p>
<p>—九月十八日—</p>
<p>註一：此處純粹依法定滙價計算，事實上貿價與費價之間尙有差異，惟平常此種差異甚小，故一角滙兌失其平衡時，套滙便有利可圖。</p>
<p>註二：七月一日二日休假，故改取七月三日</p>
<h3>豐年問題之檢討</h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>（一）導言</p>
<p>今春獻歲以來，各地因去年秋收荒歉，春荒問題，殊形嚴重。綠是第一季洋米進口，數達四四〇，四九三公担；藉以救濟糧荒。乃最近，事態丕變；蓋自今春播種以來，風調雨順，尙未遇任何打擊，是以今歲預測，全國可望豐收。八月杪，內政部長蔣作賓在中央班行第三十九次總理紀念週中，即報吿豐年問題。略謂：年年現在，接到全國各省報災報荒之電文，紛至杳來，但今年則不然；截至目前，內政部並未接到一件報災或報荒的文件。並且本人所接到私人方面報吿。。全國各省今年均豐收；本人在皖得悉，皖省今年十四成收穫。在廬晤贛熊鄂揚兩中席，悉贛今年有十四成；鄂亦十足。這樣情形，是數十年來所未有，足為全國人民所慶賀者也。但收成旣豐，更應對倉儲管理方法，嚴加改善；俾人民不受穀賤傷農之影響。關於倉儲改善與整理舊倉添築新倉種種方法，內政部已草擬法規：刻正呈請行政院，一俟通過，卽通飾各省施行。庶可使此數十年所未有之豐收，不因存儲不善而受損害。……一同時；國民政府紀念週時，立法院院長孫科亦有同樣報吿。（見九月一日申報）吾人由此觀察，大概今年全國豐收的希望，當不至於落空。茲且　檢討豐年問題於下。</p>
<p>（二）豐年問題的一般檢討</p>
<p>（一）豐年問題與經濟循環我國農事經營之方法，尙滯留於租放經營之狀態下，年成之豐熟與吾，聽諸「天命」，故歷來年歲豐歉，有如波濤起伏，旣沒有速年飢荒，亦無歲歲豐登，諺所所『荒年過去熟　來』，蓋卽此意。此種情形，正與社會經濟循環上的週期性，如影隨形；遙相適合。茲將姚慶三氏試編中國經濟年紀民國以來的農業情形與社會經濟的循環週期，編列如左：</p>
<p>查姚氏試編之中國經濟年紀係根條美國　哲爾授與桑浦博士合編之「商情年紀」BusinessAnnals中關於中國方面材料補充而成。故經濟循環週期，照樣分為四個時期：（一）興旺時期Prosperity，（二）衰落時期Depression，（三）由興旺時期至襄落時期為轉疲時期Recession（四）由衰落時期至興旺時期為復元時期Revival。民國以來的豐收年成，前後計有十一次。（年除外）每間三年必有一次豐收。而在經濟衰落時期中，有七次豐年；占民國以來豐年决數百分之六四。民經濟復元時期中，有二次豐年；占民國以來豐年决數百分之一八。在經濟興時期旺中，有二次豐年；占民國以來豐年决數百分之一八，但在社會經濟轉疲的　期中，則從未見有豐熟年成一次。由此概想：年成之豐稔，係社會經濟衰落週期好轉推動的自然機紐，亦足以緊一切經濟組織之原動力。故在經濟落時期中豐年特多，蓋即物極必反之原理也。</p>
<p>其决豐年係災荒减少之結果。試觀前表，當可明瞭；凡遇水災旱災之年，其年成必歉收；反之，則年歲豐稔。惟在民國十七年，西北旱災，在米穀則又豐收；驟視之，似甚矛盾。須知西北並非米產策源地，其第一年旱災，當不足以影響全局。惟再接續兩年旱災，則淮河及長江流域米產之區，民衆紛紛運糧前往放賑；此其結果，自不能再獨豐於華中華南。故十八，十九兩年全國米穀均屬歉收。</p>
<p>（二）豐年問題與季節變遷依全年米穀供需情形而觀察：在每年的九，十，十一，十二，四個月，係米榖供過於求的季節；即通常所謂新穀登塲時期。而在五，六，七，八，四個月係米穀求過於供的季節；卽通常所謂靑黃不接時期。穀賤傷農，係在新穀登塲季節中所表演；穀貴傷民，則在靑黃不接季節中所呈露。故與豐年問題最有關係李節，卽係米穀供過於求的新穀登塲時期。試以民國以來豐年新米的平均價格一加檢視，常可知農民損失程度的一斑。</p>
<p>民國以來豐年時期新米平均價格與本年度米價平均比較表</p>
<p>觀上表；新穀登塲時期的平均米價無年不較平均米價為低。惟在民國八年的新穀登塲時期，其新米價格反較本年度的平均價格高漲百分之六；蓋是年適値歐戰吿終，巴黎和會簽字，各國以戰後糧食缺乏，羣向產米國大量購買；同時在我國政府又將米穀禁止出口之禁令取銷。於是大量米穀，源源流出。故雖在豐年的新穀登塲時期，尙呈露求過於供之現象。此係特殊情形，固不能持作標準者。</p>
<p>（三）今歲豐年問題之檢討</p>
<p>（一）今年收成預測　今年米穀產量究屬多少，現尙無可靠之估計。各省所謂十成與十四成等之估計，均係心理方面之猜測而已；自不能視為可靠之標準。惟從最近五年米穀生產量推算；則今年收成，充其量或可較二十二年豐收米產稍可增加。請試將近五年米產情列表如左：</p>
<p>查二十一二十二兩年，係近五年來米榖　收成續最可觀的年成。故在二十三年春季，所囤積的米糧，據老於米業者估計：上海一隅，洋米國積有一百萬包之多；雖非國米，但總因國米豐收而無銷納。無錫米糧四積亦有一百三十萬石之譜；湖南則更有三年米糧圍積之說。（見社會經濟月報一卷三期）再據江西經濟委員會之報吿：二十二年年底，江西產米達一一一，四二八，一九七擔，故除本省消費外，尙餘百餘萬擔可以運出。其他各省情形，亦均相同。若就本年度（二十二年）的每畝收成率而言，則二十二年度全國稻作面積為二七九，九〇五，〇〇〇畝，（見中央農業實騐所農情報告）其每畝平均收成率為穀子三石五斗。</p>
<p>至於今年的米產情形究竟如何？財政部部長孔祥熙於前日接見新新社記者暢談中央財政情形時。渠會云：『今年農業之豐收，雖由於天助；然亦半由人力。蓋年來各省水利之興修，鑒植面積之拓農，種植技術之改進，此種工作之男力，均為增加生產之源。故希望全國人民切不以此豐稔之年歲為可喜，宜切實注意更如何努力以增加生產。因我國統計可耕之地，不下四十萬萬畝，而現用以耕種者不過十五萬萬畝！……」（見九月七日申報）今日孔氏估計之現用耕種面積與前讓府主計處統計局所估計的全國作物面積一，五三四，四〇〇·〇〇〇畝的數字，依然未會增加。惟在稻作物面積佔全國作物面積的百分比，是否有無拓展；在孔氏則未會述及。據筆者所知：統計局之調查時期，乃在四年以前；當時該局所估計之稻作物面積為一八三，五四六，〇〇〇畝，占全國作物面積百分之十八；衡之二十二年度中央農業實騐所農情報吿所估計，兩者似尙相符。惟自二十三年中央厲行禁毒禁烟政　後，原有種檀鴉片興其他毒物之地畝，多改種糧食。但此項政情，係在統計局調查之後；故吾人推想，全國稻作面積，或許有拓展之可能。且有若干省份如廣東，廣西，江西，福建諸省稻作年有二次甚至三次之收穫者，若依統計局之估計而言，則實際上稻作面積當僅占全國作物面積白分之十四而已。故林熙春氏估計當倍之為二十八。（見社會經濟月報二卷三期四六頁）惟以吾人之推想：稻作物面積，當占全國作物面積百分之二十至二十五之間。</p>
<p>今姑以今年全國稻作物面積為全國作物面積的百分二十四。（全國作物面積仍根據統計局所估計）則今年植稻面積當為三六八，二五六，〇〇〇畝。以每畝平均收成率為穀子三石五斗計；則今年收成估計當為一，二八八，八九六，〇〇〇担。較二十一年豐收時增加百分之三十三，較二十二年豐收時增加百分三十一；此項數字，是否可靠，須留待後日證明。惟有一問題，吾人不能不注意；蓋粵·閩·贛·桂等省，年有二次甚至三次收穫，吾人若就「土地　報酬漸減律一之經濟原則而言；凡收穫次數愈高，則其收成率必愈低；此係千古不磨之典則，稍具經濟常識者，均能道之。故每畝收成率是否能每决均有榖子三石五斗，此係一問題。其决，三石五斗之收成率，係根據二十二年度之米產與植稻面積計算而得；然在中央農業實騐所調查稻作面積時，是否民間因避稅關係，將植稻田畝以多報少或漏報；再者我國田畝面積，於計算方法，向無一致標準：有以秧苗為標準，以能蒔若干束秧苗為一畝；有以犁溝為標準，在犁田時計算若干溝為一畝；種種方法，不勝枚舉。計算方法不同，田畝大小則不一律；故此三石五斗穀子之收成率，在在有使人懷疑之處。此又一問題。若據專家估計；我國土地生產力，僅較高於印度。在生產技術未改進前，每畝平均收成率，僅二石左右。此復一問題。目前我農事經營方法，尙滯留于租放經營之下；於土地生產力，祗有减未增。今年之豐收，實際上係自然環境之良好，尙非人為方法之收種也。故依種種觀測，本年度米數豐收之估計，充其量，或無突破十萬萬石之可能。若依俗例七三折　穀成米，估計收米當在七萬萬石左右。</p>
<p>（二）國民消費估計查國民對於米糧每年平均消費量，目前政府尙無正式的估計。在私人方面，雖然有非正式的估計，但皆各說各是，殊不一致。故無從估測全年消費的總額。林熙春氏會粽合各方面的材料，推測每人每年平均有米二担二斗似可足用；並以全國入口作四萬五千萬計算，而食米人口占三分　即三萬萬人計算。則年需米糧為六六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇担。</p>
<p>若依林氏所估計之數字標準：則今年豐收米糧，除全國國民費外，尙可餘剩四千萬担。惟實際上不然，據中央農業實騐所估計，我國米穀除國民正當食用外，其餘均用于醮酒；其數量，的當用於人類食糧全數百分之十八。依此推算；則今年收穫之七萬萬担米糧，須被民間酒坊扣除一萬二千六百萬担，留作釀酒之用；所可供給民間正當食用者，僅五萬七千四百萬担而已！尙缺八千六百萬担米糧，無從取給。否則非遭三個多月的飢荒，卽係三千餘萬人尙須承仰洋米的鼻息。</p>
<p>（三）各地盈虧一斑　依地理環境而言：我國米產最富之區，係在北緯三十二度以南諸省，如四川，湖南，江西，安徽等地，均係米糧過剩省份。試就其在民國二十二年豐收年成，米榖對內貿易情形，一加檢視，當可窺測其米穀過剩斑。</p>
<p>查二十二年為米穀豐收之年。安徽省過剩米毅輸往外省者，計逮三·四九一·三三九擔米為該年全國糧食過剩最多省份。湖南本為產；，之區，古有「湖廣熟，天下足！」之諺。該省是年輸往外省者，計六一八，一〇一擔，居糧食過剩省份之第二位；而外省輸入湖南者，僅四六擔！江西是年輸往外省者，計五三〇，九四一擔，居第三位；而外省輸人江西者為三，七九三擔。四川輸往外省者，計九，七五六擔。以上四省輸往外省總額，為四，六五〇，三七扭；而外省輸入本省之總額為三，八三九擔。不足輸出額千分之一。查二十二年全國米毅產額為九八四·一九〇·〇〇〇擔，而該四省米榖過剩量，為全國米穀產量百分之五；惟該四省是年運往外省之米榖，其一部份有業經　成糙米出省者，故其實際上過剩數量，當不止全國的百分之五。依吾人之推測，當在百分之七八左右。至於本年度之情形，該四省米產　剩，是否能較二十二年度為高？吾人從各方面研究估計：充其量，至多與二十二年相等而已。蓋二十二年係繼承二十一年度豐年之後；二十一年度豐收過剩之米毅，以種種關係，必不能掃數運往他省。故二十二年度除本年豐收外，再能從從容容將二十一年度豐收之存糧，運銷出省。吾人若就該四省二十一年度輸往外省米穀與二十二年度相互比較，當可更為明瞭。</p>
<p>查二十一年度全國米產額，為九六九，〇八〇，〇〇〇担。當二十二年度全國米產額之百分之九八·五。在收成方面，亦殊可觀。然以新穀登塲已在二十一年度之最後一季，故以時間關係，必不能掃數運往他省；且此時各省米穀均係供過於求季節，自再無胃銷納外省米穀。故存糧雖豐，祇有留待來年（卽二十二年）出省。是以二十二年之米榖出省數量，實際上有一個半彆年的總額。由是以觀。：則今年豐收情形，是否係承襲去年豐收餘蔭？如去年年成無二十一度之豐稔情形，則今年該四省之米產過剩，恐尙無二十二度之成續。</p>
<p>其决，就自給省份論，江蘇，河北，湖北，廣西，四省，在廿二年豐收聲中，為對內貿易出人超互見者。在江蘇雖係米產策源地，但近年人口密度較高於他省；據專家估計，實際上祗能自給。卽在豐年，輸出亦不多。河北，湖北，廣西，三省，米穀生產並不十分重要，但在自給上或可無問題。餘如廣東，福建，浙江，山東，雲南諸省，均係米穀缺乏省份；且西南又係洋米輕稅省區，故洋米每年輸入允鉅。以上各省情形，均就廿二年豐收後分析而得；至於其今年情形如何，一時固難確切肯定。惟就大體情形而言：過剩省份米穀固能過剩，但不足省份米穀則斷難自給而再餘糧者。此蓋可斷言也。</p>
<p>（四）結論</p>
<p>總合而言：我國歷來所謂年成豐熟，國人往往誤認為米穀自給的機會；實際上大錯特錯。中國米穀眞正要肉給，非先調整生產技術與拓展耕地面積不可。蓋穀賤傷農的原因，全係新穀一時的供過於求現象；如就經濟原則而言：則並未不合。唐文愷氏以為穀賤可以傷農，亦可以益農；其癥結在穀賤時農民除開支一切生產費用外，有無盈餘可以交換應用之物品；如有相當之盈餘足以償其物質上應有之一切設備，則穀賤不足為害也。故主張增加農產收穫與减輕負担；但以事體過大，曲高和寡。吾人為謀解决今歲之豐年問題計，故暫以治標入手，從平衡新榖的供求情形為範疇。易言之：即在米榖過剩省份着手普及『簡易農會』，在米榖自給與不足的省份，則從統制運銷入手。</p>
<p>查積穀救荒之法，中國行之很久；但以淸末倉政廢弛，劣紳把持挪用，致民間倉儲事業，日漸衰落。十七年行政院雖有草擬之倉儲辦法，規定全國倉庫等級為（一）國立儲備倉；（二）省立　備倉；（三）縣倉；（四）區倉；（五）鄉倉等五類。但以種種關係，未克决第實現。筆者以為倉儲事業，固宜竭力提倡；但於此時此地的失常環境，亦不能不顧到。故主張國倉，省倉，縣倉之成立問題，認為巳成立者，聽其繼續經營；其未成立者，則暫從緩辦。蓋此類倉庫，多係採取糧食大量集中保管制，於安全問題，殊堪斟酌；萬一非常事變，則此鉅額儲糧，難免不被轟炸！緣是目前辦倉庫事業，當以『簡易」，『普及』與『分散保管』三者為最高原則。况就目前實際之民力上言，亦以此三者為易舉。至於普及此種簡易農倉之方法，除利用舊時倉儲資金及地方公欵而外，更應利用四週有關係之經濟環境；如合作社，鐵道，公路，郵儲局等。因若輩與米穀或有生產上關係，或有運銷十關係，或有金融放欵上關係；均可出其餘力以協助農民來普及農倉設置。</p>
<p>其决關於簡易農倉分佈之地點，在今年豐收問題中，宜以米穀過剩省份為中心；如湖南，江西，安徽三省允宜切實注意。蓋在此過剩省份農民能將自己糧食保在而不為無系統的傾銷外省則自給省份之穀價，在新穀登塲時期自可减輕許多威脅；而榖價不至於慘落。在糧食缺乏之省，則由省政府當局辦理統制運銷；視本省缺乏之情形，作為添辦外省米糧之標準。總之：在米糧過剩省份，以普及簡易農倉為中心工作；在米糧缺乏省份，以統制運銷為中心工作，其在自給之省，則由政府管理米穀賣買。全國上下一心，分工合作；則今歲之豐年問題，當可穩然過渡。</p>

<h3>淋病對于抗菌治療法之原理</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>消炎只能減輕病灶部分之炎衝症狀　抗菌對于組織浸潤膿之直接作用　治淋劑之唯一要求與三個條件！</p>
<p>淋病之措施，年來已發生一極大變革，此蓋為轟動　整個治療界之事。在以前，淋病惟盛行透膜殺菌療法，第因屬局部治療，事實上已證明並無確效。因其治療價值，早被醫家所否定；而一致要求「要求新療法，創立焉。</p>
<p>繼局部殺菌療法而起者，為抗素抗體說。此以喚起淋病人之體內「自然療能」，而抗除尿道及體中各部組織之邋遢毒為指歸。蓋動物體中，本有一種喰菌機能，卽名為「自然療能」。然欲昻進此種防病喰菌機能，則非施用蛋白體，莫能奏效故Hansen敎授首創此說，Shagnhufer　U.Horwitz兩博士復加改良謂配用純淨色素，効力更大，乃由其門下生國際學者Biedel博士，製為「克淋儂」一藥。</p>
<p>普通消炎劑只能減輕局部病灶周圍之炎衝症症狀，而無阻止尿道上皮細胞增殖之功，今「克淋儂」以其特殊之效用，能使上皮細胞，粘膜深部，寶，尿道腺排泄管等之炎症，均迅歸消滅。其二：則可增加白血球之數理與喰菌力，以呑喰體內深部之關節炎之發生。其三：則予細胞以實質的機能增進，得令炎灶部分之壞疽。化膿組織，迅速快復常態！故凡男子之急性尿道炎，慢性攝腺炎，慢性攝腺炎，睪丸炎等淋濁，及婦女陰門炎，　　炎，子宮炎等淋毒赤白帶下，服克淋儂自一個月至二個月前後，卽可根棲治愈，可免再發之虞！惟婦女帶下宜兼外用「卡而雪地一為」坐藥。</p>
<h3>張競生博士的人生哲學</h3>
<p>— 陳少華</p>
<p>根據孟子的：「食色，性也」。　創立了性學和「食經」的人生兩大綱領!</p>
<p>誰都知道張競生先生是位哲學博士，但誰也知道他又是一位性學專家。他的言論雖被人詆為猥褻，但從生理，醫學，哲學，社會學上講，人生的活動，文化的起源，還不是建築在「食」「色」兩字上嗎？孟子說：「食色，性也」；可見這原是人的本能。因此，怎樣滿足夫婦間有規則的生活？和怎樣增强食慾？都是兩個急待解答的問題。而後者對於生胃病的人，尤為需要。因為胃病的嘔葉惡心，噯氣酸逆，嘈雜脘悶，食後作脹作痛，痛苦非常。據我的臨床實騐，德國「强胃精」一藥，確有治療上述胃病各症的功效。約服三四瓶到七八瓶，便可全治。此外口臭，唾濃，消化不良的大便秘結，瓦斯多而善屁，洩演腹痛等，服「强胃精」亦可全瘳。補力雄厚和平，有治病後和虛弱的胃呆等良好功續！</p>
<h3>怎樣克服白帶病</h3>
<p>— 金月仁醫師</p>
<p>不去克服牠</p>
<p>就成為一切病的根源</p>
<p>白帶病是我們女同胞中最流行之病。因為很普遍，而又普遍地視牠為一種隱疾，就不十分注意治療，於是在這不知不覺中種下禍根；因為我們身上凡是有粘膜的潮潤地方，最易招惹細菌。我們往往看到許多患有白滯的婦女，她下部忽然出血，這都是由於細菌作崇，而又失了治療的緣故。再不然，她們幸而免得出血，那麼陰道糜爛，小腹膨脹作痛，陰門也因長時間的侵潤而發炎紅腫，結果房事與小便時候，便感到極大的痛楚，又許多月經不調的女子，也都有起於白帶病的。</p>
<p>憑我們平日臨床上的實騐，白帶病雖有這樣兇險。但只要有防腐鎭痛止泌的坐藥，那就可自然治愈了。「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，他的功效正與前述的治帶的條件相合。所以「卡氏陰道片」是白帶藥中之權威者，不論遠年新起的白帶，都可治愈。不過如果從前是因月經病，或先有了白帶而後月經不調，都可用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，更可服「補女容」以調整月經。其因丈夫的淋毒傳染而來者，可兼服「克淋儂」以掃除淋病，那麼收效必也很速了。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>診所　四川路甯波路轉角　診時　上午時至下午六時</p>
<p>淋毒性輸精管炎之後果。</p>
<p>輸精管，是負輸送精液之繁殖器管。地位甚為重要。凡患淋毒性睪丸炎，而不作徹底之治療，則淋菌更作進一步之侵略而成輸精管炎，若此時猶不醫治，則此管因發炎而閉塞，遂不能負輸精責任。成為不孕之主因。又幸而未閉塞，與異性接觸，此精液與淋菌，同時注射　道，因此發生十分劇烈之陰道淋，或子宮淋，予生殖上以重大之威脅。</p>
<p>故對於此症之處置，非內外兼顧不可。設不依此治療，則殊有顧此失彼之苦。有患者　培先君，長沙籍，在滬經商多年。現住海格路某里。罹淋病已三四年，雖醫治未間，而厥疾未瘳，繼發睪丸炎，遂成慢性，故未十分注意。　因朋友介紹來我處診療，則其陰莖與睪丸間，有粗筯脹起，發炎腫痛，尿後繼之以血。蓋已成副睪丸炎與兼輸精管之合併症矣。乃因抗淋血淸與電氣治療外，同時囑服德國「克淋儂」，以增體內抗毒素而收殺菌除淋鎭痛之效。未幾果見炎消腫，平復如恒，睪丸與輸精管，已恢復原有健全。惟其夫人亦早染淋毒性白帶甚重，膿液紛流，局部糜爛，妨害排尿，且又誘發月經不調而停孕多年，遂囑內服「克淋儂」以除淋，外用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥以滌帶，四星期後淋淸帶淨，病灶已平復如恒。後又以「補女容」以調其月經。一月後，經水即按期而至。偕居迄今已二子矣。</p>
<h3>愛的連索</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>愛的連方向盤是什麼？</p>
<p>失了這連索愛還可以維繫嗎？</p>
<p>失了愛的連索的不可不注意他！</p>
<p>說句老實話，兩性的戀愛，是以性慾為根基的。假使連性還沒有萌芽小孩，和靑春腺已完全消失了的老人，他們是沒有什麼戀愛可談，就是老人有談戀愛，如非他的靑春腺還存在的話，實際上總覺得那個。</p>
<p>我們根據兩性戀愛建築於性慾上的而言，那末，愛的連索就是性慾。但是有許多實際上發育還沒有健全的靑年男女，他們就加以手淫，和早婚，過度的摧殘靑春腺，這好像將要待放的花蕾，猝遭風雨的打擊，試問還能有嬌艷奪目的花開給我們看嗎？當然是沒有的</p>
<p>所以犯了手淫和色慾過度的靑年，他們的靑春腺大都末能發育完全的。而且性神經都因此而萎弱，所以有生殖發育不全，遺精，滑精，陰莖勃起力不堅等症。更由此等症狀而來之頭涌失眠，健忘心悸，貧血食減等症，試問對於兩性愛情，還能維繫嗎？而且因此在我們的事業上也難以發展。我們為增進人類幸福，恢復兩性愛情起見，就不得不用適當而有效之處置。我在俄國勞動大學醫科五年畢業後，在莫斯醫院實習時，常參究各家學說，根據克斯拉夫，諾爾諸博士的實騐嵯於性神經衰弱與發育不全的靑年，每用於梅倫氏之「補體康」一藥最為有效。因「補體康」係用勇壯動物之荷爾蒙，更以科學方法製成的。故服後能補給由手淫或房事過度所損失之大量荷爾蒙，而摧長發育，並强化生殖系的組織，所以能將各項神經衰弱的疾患掃除之，而恢復兩性健全的生活。這是已經有千萬人實驗成功的特效藥。故「補體康」一藥，為任何內分泌製劑所不及也。故又譽「補體康」為兩性愛情之連索云。但服用者必須注意除連服此藥外，對於手淫惡習務必戒除，房事也宜有節。那末，此藥的菌效必更為偉大了。</p>
<h3>女子為何容易發怒</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>是神經衰弱之表示，根源則月經不訓亦占最大原因；為丈夫者必須留意於此！</p>
<p>多悉善感，古人多以此為女子特性，女子亦以此而受異性之憐惜，然時移世易，此等林黛玉式之病態美，早已落伍矣。然健美女子，究不多見，耳目所觸，皆此等病態婦女也，據吾人臨床上之所經騐，患者神情恍惚，偶有拂逆之事，卽悉悶易怒，頭痛頭重，終日如戲　箍，心悸亢進，夜不成寐，身瘦面色有如梔蠟，或晦暗無光，呈貧血狀態，白帶下注，而原因實以月經不調而來也。然患者每因易干惱怒，夫婦感情遂致乖異，因此益增病勢，甚或以致仳離者，故女性神經衰弱與月經不調，對於婦女之一生幸福實大有關係矣。</p>
<p>關於此項症狀之處置，必須從根本解決之，以歐美各國醫家之研究，僉必先調整其內分泌機能，如卵巢機能等失常時，恒能陷月經不調，及停經等境地。更由是激起神經衰弱及以上述諸症。德國「補女容」一藥，對於調整卵巢機能，有特殊之良效。並能强壯神經，鎭靜神經，故服後能於五六星期中即可獲效。且月經亦獲調整而易受孕，又能使理智明晰，身心愉快，精神活潑，脂肪增多，以達肥瘦適中之程度，故呈肌肉細緻，面色嬌紅之妍態。實為根本之美容法。惟有白帶病者，可外用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥以滌除帶下，則療法更為週到圓滿矣。</p>
<h3>手淫病為什麼犯者那樣多？</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>遺精的主要治療不是堵塞輸精管　鎭靜神經並非減除性慾的解釋</p>
<p>手淫病可以說是一種社會病，因為它的戟因乃是繫於經濟上。因為近來來生活程度提高，結婚問題極難解決。就是要去嫖妓也還得有一筆臨時費用，所以一般達到色情旺盛期的靑年，在性的興奮時多半走向遙淫那條魔道上去。有些人以為偶爾取樂，無關重要；誰知一經沾染，便成為惡癖，欲戒除却很難了。</p>
<p>隨手淫而來的便是神經衰弱，發生遺精。遺精次數一多，輸精管便失去其靭性，再沒有控制精夜的能力。因此治療遺精的方法，首在增强輸精管的控制力和靭性，靭性的表現，即射精時的痙擊，這種痙擊能增加夫婦的快感。而控制力一强，遺精就不會再有。「耐而斯遺精片」旣能解除遺精病的精管弛緩，又能加强痙擊力，增加快感，故和普遍固止遺精的者塞精管方法不同。而且此藥能鎭靜神經，使不致見色即流。（鎭靜神經不是減除性慾，乃是避免虛性興奮）。故「耐而斯遺精片」能治一切遺精症。遺漏滑洩等，甚至每週遺精五六次者，服之三四瓶即可全治。最好同時服「補體康」挽治遺精後之衰弱，那末效力更來得大！</p>
<p>金瓶梅斷片研究</p>
<h3>李瓶兒是怎樣得癆病死的？</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>醋火中燒，西門慶不該去討小老婆！</p>
<p>悒　不樂和發生肺癆之關係何在？　「癆病百問」之9－10</p>
<p>鄧醫師診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時</p>
<p>「金瓶梅」這部書，本來是部禁書。現在衛道先生們又說它是淫書而把它改頭換面刪去不少。雖然其中精華已漸消失，但還有很多的地方頗足供生理學，病理學，心理學者的研究。我們此刻要說的便是關於李瓶兒的肺病問題。</p>
<p>李瓶兒本來是西門慶一個寵愛的美妾，自從西門慶討了一潘金蓮做第三房後，她便失戀以一般人都說：憤怒和悲傷，斷送了李瓶兒！</p>
<p>精神不愉快，怎樣會使李瓶兒得癆病！從醫學上言：人體的感染癆病，都是因為球境的劇變（不良的方面），體力的銳滅。過用心力，極度勞動，悲憤太甚，都足以招致癆菌的繁殖，減損抵抗能力。準此。治療肺病，第一就該增旺抵抗力，其次便應消滅癆菌。癆菌的消滅，在於增加病灶的石灰質，尤其須要減去足以繁殖癆菌的肺內酸素！！具有此項作用的製劑，只有「補肺拿爾」一藥。此藥實治肺癆欬血，咳嗽，胸痛的無上良劑，且毫無流弊。如果肺癆兼有神經衰弱，失眠頭痛，腰疫健忘等症，除服「補肺拿爾」外，可兼服男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」以增加身體抵抗力。「補女容」還可調正婦女的經期，補血溫宮。如有體虛白帶，可外用「卡而雪地」為陰道坐藥。至於男子兼有早洩陰萎，遺精精漏等，可並服「補體康」補腎和「耐而斯遺精片」治遺精。至「補肺拿爾」却還有治潮熱盜汗的功效呢。</p>
<h3>縮短淋病痛苦之方法</h3>
<p>— 楊道南醫師</p>
<p>淋病早治　等於早脫囹圄；</p>
<p>……但亦不可急功近利，必須行當的處置……</p>
<p>患者于叔田君，前月在友家應酬乘醉回家，以在深夜，為妓所誘，歸後僅五日，即覺尿道中刺痛如灼，排尿更如鑽刺，旋膿液即泊泊流出，龜頭包皮，俱因淋毒的刺戟而發炎紅腫。幸于君頗有醫學常識，聞余對於淋病治療上，頗有心得。故於病起後之第三日而乞余治療，遂將其漸出之分泌物，用Caram氏染色法後，以顯微鏡檢查之，在多核白血球中，有無數之淋菌相混。（如第一圖）此乃急性尿道炎也。幸淋病尙在前尿道，不難一鼓盪平。乃滌淸其尿道膿液外，即投服「克淋儂」，以利尿消炎殺菌，俾淋菌無立足地，以免向內反攻。如此連服至三星期後，龜頭包皮之炎腫盡消，並排尿亦得完全自由，與平時無異。其尿亦瑩潔而毫無淋系。然猶恐未完全根治也。乃將于君晨起初次小便檢查之淋病菌完全絕跡，惟于君體素虛，尿中略帶些徴精子（見第二圖）遂囑服「補體康」至一星期亦獲全愈。此乃淋病速治，以縮短痛苦期也。否則變症百出，且將成漏精。因「補體康」對於淋病愈後，最為相宜。</p>

<h3>保護肺臟等於增加生命的源泉</h3>
<p>— 武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>秋燥司令，肺金遭殃——這是舊說。　迅除痰咳，可免久咳內傷及一切氣管病。</p>
<p>我們不必拿理論來說明肺臟的重要，只要看一個人咳嗽一夜，第二天便覺得精疲力盡，言語無力，那就可以證明肺臟過於勞動，比較登山賽跑，還要吃力。</p>
<p>所以保護肺臟，直等于攝養體力，也就無異增加生命的源泉。現在，秋燥司令了，舊說這正是個不適於肺部的季節。其實，秋天寒暖不常，易於傷風咳嗽。咳嗽原是難治的，若果忽視，或擇藥不愼，每致延為久咳，慢慢的變為內傷癆瘵，危險不堪！服藥最好能够治咳防癆，兼施並顧，而確有此等偉效的藥物，則惟有「補肺拿爾」。「補肺拿爾」不但功擅除痰，根治咳嗽，而且小兒百日咳，老人痰喘等一切氣管病。它都有特著奇騐，這只要服過後便能知道。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴　秋感</h3>
<p>— 周國昌</p>
<p>颯颯的秋風，吹得那滿樹的葉兒，一片片的落下，那些茸茸的小草，也都戰慓的變了顏色，一隊隊的飛雁翱翔在天空，發出那嘹哀的聲音，傳送進我的耳膜中，頓時使我增添了無限的悲意。</p>
<p>夏去秋臨，原來是一年中的自然現象，但是光陰卻過得這樣地迅速，一霎時間便時過境遷，看那生物在春夏的時候，長得蓬蓬勃勃，一到了秋天，就漸漸地枯黃了。正如人生一世，當靑春有為時候，卻不去幹正經，把寶貴的光陰白白地荒廢；一旦到了頭髪花白，臉上添了許多皺紋的時候，雖欲進取，而精神卻頹敗，終於一事無成，想起從前，悔之無及，只有慨嘆罷了。</p>
<p>我希望我們這些靑年，當着年富力强的時候，拼命去努力你的前途，不要虛擲了寶貴的光陰，致興老大傷悲之慨。</p>
<h3>秋的閒話</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>四季之中，最够留戀的，我以為不是春，而該是秋。原因是，春是煩悶的。人生的苦悶，往往是跟着苦悶的春，侵入人間的。這種苦悶，秋風起了，才跟着落葉而被掃除掉。所以在秋季中，我們所感到的，是心曠神怡，是莫名的舒適。</p>
<p>人的視野，是該得到調劑的。所以在冬季中，有皚皚的白雪，覆蓋着宇宙，使我人得到一個轉換環境的樂趣。春秋二季中，所見的，無非是青枝綠葉，紫蕊紅花。經了長長二季的紅花綠葉的包圍，而進入到一個葉黃枝禿的秋景裏，雖然善感的詩人，不由的因之而感傷身世，但是我以為這正是老天給與我人的一種視野的調劑，也可說是我人須覓取生活調劑的暗示。</p>
<p>浮淺地說來，秋也可說得是一個不奢侈的季節。不需要在夏季中所需的凉意，也不需要在冬季所需的人工的暖意。在秋季中，人身中的血液的奔馳，也沒有在春季中那麼的急速。生長的機能，遂漸地處於靜止的狀態，但也不像在冬季中，那麼的枯燥而缺乏生機。所以秋是一個儉而不吝的模範。</p>
<p>若是我們對於春的頌贊，是豐腴的美女，那麼，對於秋，該說是淸癯的老人。山，是已褪了緣意，但是還沒有光禿。樹，是已消失了成蔭的綠葉，但還沒有顯出着枯幹。大地上，雖已沒有了黃鸝的鳴聲，但是瞿瞿的蟋蟀，一聲二聲的孤雁長嗚，點綴得也不像冬的寂寞。所以秋是淸矍的老人，精神還是那麼的鑠，一點兒不像冬那麼的顯示着龍鍾。</p>
<p>但是秋風起矣，有綫人家，是忙着預備吃螃蟹，賞菊花了，沒錢的所僅有的一身破夾襖袴，所僅有的一牀舊棉被，還寄藏於長生庫中，無法取贖，正在焦慮着。大商鋪中，秋季大减價的旗招，臨風招展着，大櫥窗裏的年虹燈下，不住地似乎閃耀着高貴的貨品的笑臉，窮漢們是只有咬着下嘴唇，對着這些兒，呆呆地出神，目送着紳士們姑娘們的滿載而去。—這一層，或許還是表示着秋是相當的勢利的吧？</p>
<h3>秋雲</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>秋雲是够味的，我從小就和宅結不解緣；後來踏入社會，幸而又得個看見大日的鄉下服務，因此「秋雲」便給我一個，深刻的認識。每當恬靜的晨曦，或是「欵乃聲中送夕陽」的黃昏，總是獨自踽隅地跑到郊野去欣賞一會，如果遇着下雨，雖然停止習以為常的功，課但心中總不免似失掉心愛東西般的不快！</p>
<p>因為秋雲太可愛了，、在廣闊的天幕上，隨時變幻，千態萬狀，如果拿魔術師來形容，可謂恰當之至。</p>
<p>故鄉看秋雲最佳的塲所是齊雲山和黃山，據說因為山高的緣故，到了山頂，雲已在你的眼簾了，不要說看，就是用手去捉，也容易得着。但可惜自己未曾嘗試過，其中滋味如何，還不敢盡量介紹出來。</p>
<p>人們常以秋雲來比喻人情，可是如今的人情，簡直不如秋雲呢！讀秋水軒尺牘，許葭林致陸緘之的信說：「弟為援例，日呼將伯；詎意秋雲世態，流水人情，平日敦氣誼，重然諾；「語通財，反眼若不相識；蓋自吿急以來，幾於十扣柴扉九不開矣。」雖不是完全以「秋雲」來作比喻；但當時的人情已充分地表顯出來了。假使許公如今還存在的話，那眞不知他用怎樣的雲來咒詛世態呢？</p>
<p>自家兒雖是歡喜欣賞秋雲的，但讀許公約信，又不禁抽了一口冷氣。</p>
<h3>不寂寞的秋</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>已凉太氣末寒時，是秋季所專有的營語，因為在秋季中，巳沒有像在夏季中那麼可怖的炎熱，也沒有　在冬季中那麼可怖的寒冷，所以秋季，該可以說是一年之中，最可愛的一個季節。而且俗更有春華秋實的那麼一句話，的確，衣的棉，食的粟，都是在這秋季中結實，而報酬着農人們，整年的辛苦，結實，而充裕着圓顱方趾者的禦寒療幾的生話必需品，所以秋季，也可說是我們的黃金季節。</p>
<p>在秋季中，我們的生活，更可以說得是頗不寂寞。巳凉天氣未寒時，正是一個旅行的良好季節。不拘是山之　，或是水之濱，都是　在晴曠的秋光中，別具着一個使人心曠神怡的景色。怒濺的浪潮，淡淡的白雲，都是旅行者的寫眞箱中的好費料。諸紅的楓葉，更是旅行者，付之吟咏的好題材。所以在這季節中，各地旅行團的活躍，自然是在意料之中。而大批的旅行者，旅行各地或許是不無小補於瀕於破產的農村經濟的。</p>
<p>秋的庭園中，也儘不會因百花的彫萎，而感寂寞的，只須在庭除籬角，栽植幾株夙有高士之風的秋菊。那麼準可以在露冷霜寒的氛圍中，不愁無萬紫千紅以悅目。在吃的方面呢，無腸公子，一天天的腦滿腸肥，在秋風中，橫行而人漁人之麓，而列諸盆碟，以供我人的大快朶顧。在玩的方面，有將軍之號的蟋蟀，不住地在階前墻下，發出誘人的唧唧瞿瞿聲，在期待着人們的捕捉與戲弄。</p>
<p>同時，在我們這個秋季中，有明月團團的中秋節，有登高避俗的重陽節，忙過了這，又忙着那，短短的秋光，準不難輕鬆地溜過。就是說一句不長進的話，就是貧病交迫着，在度着客窗生活，擁衾高臥，除了業鐺茶灶以及一燈為伴之外，儘還有怒吼的秋風聲，敲窗的秋風雨，很殷勤地來陪伴着，以解除客中的寂寞。</p>
<p>眞也是太可愛了，——我們這個不寂寞的秋。</p>

<p>夢蘭一手把筆奪了過來，就向瓷筆筒子裏扔了下去，撞着噹的一下嚮。笑道你不用鬧這些圈套了。一位大小姐作文章，能把崑崙奴三個字，用了進去嗎？友梅笑道：那末，你猜猜我是什麼意思哩。夢蘭搖搖頭道：我猜不着。友梅道：眞話，我問問你。像我這樣的人，若是自吿奮勇出來替人作崑崙奴，你想够資格不够資格？夢蘭笑道：我又不是敎書的老師，你問我這話幹什麽？友梅笑道；你這孩子太狡猾，我好好的問你，你倒是東閃西躱，你未免對我，太沒有誠意了。說到了這句，友梅巳是把臉色扳了起來。夢蘭將一個食指，在他臉腮上點了一下，笑道：你還裝路作勢，在我面前來這一手呢。友梅笑道：並非我裝腔作勢。你旣然知道了我的心事，你願意也罷，不願意也罷，你為什麼不給我一個回答？你不要以為我是個女孩子就沒有辦法。我以為我們要爭取自由，就是流血，也要試上一試的。就算黃衫崑崙奴這種人，也沒有什麼大了不得，不過有點俠氣而已，你料着我就一點俠氣也沒有嗎？他說着話，可站起來挺了胸脯子。只看他橫豎了雙眉兩腮紅的，就帶了一股子俠氣。夢蘭笑道：好啦，就算你是俠客罷。你坐下，我給你說崑崙奴這個曲。這不是唐朝一段小說故事嗎？說有一個姓崔的，去看貴人的病。那貴人吩咐一個呌綃的歌妓，伺候　生。那　生鐘了情，生了病，崑崙奴就背他進了貴人的府弟，同紅綃見面，後來又把他兩人一塊背了出來，不就是這麽一加事嗎？你這個譬喻，根本有些不大確切。我就不願比那個紅綃，你自己也不應當譬成了一個奴才。友梅道；醫方那分什麼上下，只要事情大體相像就行了。現在你不能譬紅綃，我不能譬崑崙奴，我要很冒昧的問你一句話，無論對與不對，你不能生氣，這不過是假設之詞罷了。這字宙之間，是不是還有這樣一個人，不能比姓崔的少年哩？夢蘭的臉腮上，不免泛起了一層紅暈，友梅將一個食指點着他，笑道：我有言在先，不許生氣。夢蘭强笑道：我的身世，你還不知道嗎？我問你是好朋友，我的心事，也常常吿訴你的。但是我自問守身如玉，决沒有一點不道德的行動。（七六）</p>
<h3>賣飩餛的</h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>「篤篤篤」。</p>
<p>賣餛飩的人奸像是一隻時辰鐘，當人工作了一天快要休息的時候他便來了笑嘻嘻的說：「辛苦了一天，來吃　餛飩　。」假　你身邊沒有綫，他會向你說「老主顧，除你一碗」他做生意這樣和氣，得了主廠們不少的好感。</p>
<p>他今年還祇是個二十多歲的靑年，幾年前在砲火下帶着五十多歲的父親　從瀋陽逃到上海。他不會賭博，不會喝酒嫖妓，但有一個特別的嗜好—看　，餛飩担上常放着水滸紅樓夢一類的書，他吿訴我這是挑過圖書館門口去借的，他說：「我自己掙來的錢，除了養活家裏的老父外，餘下的錢就買書」</p>
<p>他曾在瀋陽中學裏讀過一年半書，人家問他何不做個小學敎　來得寫意呢，他回答說「愛的敎育中不是說嗎？做得出好鞋子的鞋匠比無能的大學敎授，無能的律師要好得多呢。」</p>
<p>在一個星期六的下午，他手裏拿了兩帖藥，忽忽的走着，滿面罩着愁雲，那副對人和藹的笑險，早不知到那裏去了，人家說他的父親忽然害了時疫，並且病勢很重。所以做兒子的，急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻。</p>
<p>二星期已過去了，那賣餛飩人的影兒也沒有見過，我的心似乎感到異樣的寂寞，在這裏我謹祝福他們安寗無恙！</p>
<h3>水紅菱</h3>
<p>— （湖丐）</p>
<p>秋風起，菱角紫；應節薦市，實佔鄉村水產收入之大宗。江南地窪多蕩，農作而外，視此允為利藪；故遶屋淸流，漫野陂塘，莫不盛滋翠葉，俾補秋穫。湘湖產菱，與蒪藕並稱，固無論已。卽如會稽各屬，浮港瀰汶者，亦不知其幾千百頃。殘夏打獎，靑縈四圍，覺水國風光，別有　人處。及夫繁花白了，一角露紅採艇如浮鴨點點出焉；長篙短裙，大都由婦女司之；信口無腔以擷以謳較之荒山茶歌，倍饒風趣。秋汀多紅蓼。問有插向鬒邊鬥艷者，諸女伴見之，笑駡雜然作矣。篙欹船側，水刷然濺裙，則又大譁。時秋陽猶虐，炙膚可憐，而若曹泛泛東西，不盈艇不歸。夕照旣絢，纖手亦疲，甚者腥紅流指，凝注殘霞，弗以為苦也。河燈盛張，菱市漸喧，肩挑趨販者，摩肩接趾；明朝聽街頭巷尾，處處喚賣「水紅菱」矣。聞菱蕩一畝，可獲一二十金，業此老無愁風雨，不慮蟲蝕；春冬雨季，且可兼收魚蝦蒲葦之利。昔周賀有舊業一池菱之句，誠哉山巔水涯，能盡其力，無處而不足以衣食也。</p>
<p>初至錢塘。見肆上菱角，多以為西湖產；售者亦頗假此以蒙客。其實西湖無菱，係轉取之於湘湖及湖墅一帶者。每屆中秋月明，衣香浮岸之際，菱藕生涯，允稱鼎盛；擊汰蒼鏡，露坐剝食，遊人皆若以此代說餅也。故尋常數十文一斤者，是夕必倍蓰之。近杭，菱都靑色，至浙以東，皆作胭脂艷；此殆由水分之不同也？若論甘脆之味，則以南湖圓菱，最擅上乘；觸齒即破，雋過藕槳，洋洋乎難與為並。有時凉波翦燭，彼美駐擾，采采左右，殷殷餉客；覺悠幽風味，更不數銀餅薦酒時矣。湖菱著自唐代，昌谷詩所所：南湖一頃菱花白者是也。余舊作痴想：使我他日而可歸者，必闢池十畝，專殖菱藕魚蝦之類，環岸兼蒔桑　；因以嘯傲飲啄，未始非羲皇以上人也。自世受飽經，自知此願所不許了；卽果能得之，念彼淵明之徒亦豈容刻苟存於此世哉？</p>
<h3>浦江秋夜</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>是一個新秋的傍晚，我們一行三個人，踏上了停在天通庵姑上的那輛小火車，由它把我們載着，脫離了這大都會的一角。</p>
<p>車子像一條蜈蚣，它蜿蜒地順着兩根鐵軌前進，漸漸地，爬入了廣漠無垠的原野，一些河流，一些村舍，很快的在車窗外飛過去；那溫柔的秋風，恰如一個少女的氣息似的，從窗口鑽進來，輕輕地在我們的臉上吻着。</p>
<p>在砲臺灣車站下了車，踏着這一片最後的殘陽，迎着從海面上吹來的晚風，悄悄地走上了海，一種輕快的感覺，輕輕地飄上了我們意識。</p>
<p>海，詩人是愛海的，因為海的偉大，海的雄壯，它能够啟發人生；海的吼嘯，浪的澎湃，更能够喊開宇宙的秘密，敲破自然的啞謎。</p>
<p>我們在海濱上，蹓躂着，草地上和名堤上都擁滿了那些有閑的都市男女，這偉大的海便在我們面前展開着，烟波深處的點點帆影，和那在海空飛掠的白鷗，恍惚的像一個神秘的夢境。堤頭上的那盞塔燈放了亮，這彷彿是我們前途的一盞指迷燈一樣，使我們　黑暗中得到了一點光明。夜深了，人漸漸地在海濱上流動起來；澎湃的潮聲，海風的呼號，交奏成了海的交響樂。</p>
<p>「月夜聽潮汐，衣薄不勝寒。於是，我們便走上了末班回上海的乘凉夜輸。輪船在人聲喧嚷中離開了碼頭，破浪向江面前進：由吳淞江向楊樹浦行去，江面上只見些小輸船，穿梭似的來往着，點點的火光，像疎落的漁大般在隨着波浪而傾動激盪，尖銳的汽笛卻吼呌得使人耳皷都幾乎震破了。</p>
<p>當輪船航行進了楊樹浦區域之後，江面上頓顯得十分熱鬧；幾隻異國的巡洋艦，矗立在江心，艦面上躱着無數水兵，他們在唱着悲壯的戰曲，或靡靡的情歌。江中間的小火輸上放着嗚嗚的汽笛，不免令人興起凄絕之感；幾隻划子卻像逆水行舟似的在那起伏的浪濤中競渡着，好像時時有給浪頭摧覆的危險！浦東浦西兩岸上，那些聳高的摩天樓是緊緊地排列着，耀爍的燈光恰如天空的繁星般在睞着眼睛；紅綠的霓虹燈像夢一樣地在眼前顫動着，人聲車聲，已很清楚地從岸上送了過來，於是，我門已重新回到了大都會的懷抱裏。</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3>兩性間春風初度的前夕</h3>
<p>做丈夫的要怎樣預備纔可以促成妻子的快樂　為也要負起責任人人應有做母親的準備</p>
<p>縱然我們已經說過了好多關於夫婦間的重要智識，可是為了使本問題極端燦爛起見，應有更進一步討論的必要。的確，兩性相處需要解決的事眞是指不勝屈了。如果在婚前互相能够審愼求最適宜的合於科學的方法加以準備。無疑地一切婚後糾紛的事，都可一一克服，結成一個美滿的婚姻生活，不然的話，婚後的生活，便會喪失了幸福，保不定那天，又會變成了陌路人的，所以要避免這種悲慘的來臨，必定首先要充實一些健康所必需的知識。做丈夫的對於成熱時期的衛生，不能忽視，其中尤以生殖器發育的衛生為最重要。如陰莖，睪丸，攝護腺，精　等，普通都能適當發育，其原因，就是因了生殖腺分泌一種促生殖器發育之內分泌液的緣故，所以成熟時期的手淫惡癖，每惹起遺精而喪失種分泌液，生殖器就要衰退，中止發育，此外或先天不足，或縱慾無度的結果，非但沒有美滿的性器發育，而且一進入正式的丙性生活後，早洩，陰萎會使你陷入於陣陣痛苦之中，對方也受你的損害而連帶剝剝她兩性生活的弛張與戟蕩。甚至無法享受！</p>
<p>然而由男子方面想到女子方面的責任，實在也綦重異常。因為在男女的心目中，對於結了婚都會抱着獲得子女滿堂的家庭的目的與願望的，一個不孕的婦人，會悲傷無窮，而且還會因此以淚洗面的，假如她自己是健全的，　對於一個無生殖力的男人，也會引起她瞧不起的心理，可是關於生育的問題，姙娠的主要條件及女子一生的健康幸福，完全建築在月經調整中。這是無可否認的。身體强壯，經期決不錯亂。一九一五年荷爾曼氏Hermann曾加以肯定，證明男女的健康，必須生殖腺內分泌充足。如男子患早洩，陰萎，遺精及女子月經病等，以生殖腺內分泌製劑治療，最為合理，今日綜全生殖腺內泌劑，最佳者要算奧國生理學家斯丹那氏發明的『生殖素』了，（分男用女用兩種），如有早洩陰萎的男子，服此最有效果，不過遺精者同時應以『希米脫氏固精片』治之。女子的不姙症月經症等按：眞正『生殖素』係裝鐵盒，病家愼勿　購紙盒瓶裝偽藥）</p>

<h3>解剖男女手淫的心理</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>一種有效的療法—獻給迷途的羔羊！</p>
<p>來分析男女靑年的手淫心理，倒也一件有趣的事。據一位英國的精神病家曾　樣表示：有許多的精神病者，幾乎完全手淫行為，如癲癇患者一般在發作中或發作後，性慾亢進更甚；致女子演淫奔，男子甘犯性的罪惡。匪爾柏林格爾氏曾特記健康人有時在睡眠中無意識的犯手淫，雷衍匪爾得氏曾特舉實例謂地探弄陰部，每月來經時，次日晨手指盡汚月經血液，這足資證明睡眠中確探弄陰部了。</p>
<p>婦人中，有時因性的不滿，就利用手淫方法補償—這種實例據說也是不少的。</p>
<p>手淫對於神經系統損害的程度，特別顯著。發育未育分的兒童，也會犯弄手淫。至於成人，那末犯手淫也就特別衆多。講到結果在男子必罹有遺精症，因為手淫過度之後，性器異常敏覺，同時精液消耗的影響，精關弛懈，主持力消失，由全身各腺器的衰頹而使全身的發育停止，神經衰弱症，性的衰弱症異常猖獗，其人已完全陷入危險之境了。如患者欲思完全治療，攝生之外，應以『希米脫氏固精片』，治之，同時以『生殖素』消滅其神經衰弱症，那麼經過自會良好。普通遺精先會停止，然後營養逐漸恢復，最後神衰腦弱等症，如雲消霧散，爽然而愈了。</p>
<h3>戒煙法的集珍（二）</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>戒烟之法。以培補遞減為最安全可靠，此種方法可減少痛苦。不過在過程中苟無適當的　劑以輔助其體虛，則失眠，腿痠，腰背酸痛，精神不安，噴嚏，垂涎，呵欠等等病象，相繼爆發，甚至入夜盜汗，遺精。試問衰弱之體怎能支持，戒者每受此種牽累，中途失敗，故後殖腺至少製劑『生殖素』培補戒烟法值值得推崇，因其能消滅種種之困難，而奠定最後之勝利。如同時以『育維賜保命』注射之，尤能縮短戒期，堪稱當今最進步的戒煙法。鑒於下例吸者戒煙之成功，確為一有力之證據。</p>
<p>吸者吳孝祖，年廿七歲，住居於阿拉白司脫路永康里。吸煙成癮，已歷七載。現為父母所迫，勒令戒絕。因吳君身體素弱，上年春亦曾一度戒煙，經時三月，幾頻於危。結果因戒法之不合科學，依然復癮。今年夏乃以培補戒煙法試之，每日服『生殖素』四次，經過一星期之後，減煙半數，卽全無不安之狀，同時每日注射『育維賜保命』一次，三星期之後，減為服『生殖素』每日三次，煙量又自動遞減半數，如是五星期，已安全戒絕，非但絕無痛苦，而身體亦逐漸強壯也。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>為骨痛者解除煩惱</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>骨痛藥中之優勝劣敗</p>
<p>受骨痛所苦而煩惱的人，比較年歲稍高者感覺特別普遍。而年歲稍高的體力的衰弱，似乎也是直接促成本症的重要原因。這種骨痛的毛病，如僅屬於年老人所罹患的倒也罷了，可是二三十歲的靑年們，也已感受腰背酸痛之苦，實在數也不少，幾乎因此喪失了進取的壯志，弄得暮氣沉沉，精神蔞頓。</p>
<p>靑年人何以會罹患本症呢？無疑地為了縱慾過度，精力喪失。此外　為過分操勞，不知衛生，因此瘋濕內蘊，骨痛難免。輕者腰背酸痛，重則筋絡牽痛，四肢拘擊，甚至由拘擊而麻木，完全陷於半身不遂之狀。本症之經過，每由患者忽略輕徴而漸轉為沉重，故應早期治療，免受無謂的痛苦。</p>
<p>關於治療的方法，現在醫學界最進步的療法，都採用美國骨痛專家Dr.Johnston所發明的「强斯登氏骨痛片」。該藥對於治療本症，效力偉大。原因由於該藥對於骨痛，不論為血份不潔，尿酸過多，及瘋濕內蘊，都能短期根治，永不復發，並能進一步防止動脈硬化，故非但該藥為骨痛的對症良藥，且為預防中風所不可少者。凡平時血壓過高，體肥鼻紅具有腦溢血型的人們，是應該特別注意，藉此藥力以預防，亦可得到切實的效益，如感覺腰背酸疼之苦楚者，我認為非此莫屬！</p>
<p>患者程志療，年三十二歲，因性喜漁色，故早年　喪過劇，血份不潔，所患骨痛，已歷五載，起光祇覺腰背酸痛，其後蔓延及於兩肩膀，竟不能高舉，遍服各藥，鮮少效果。今春發作尤烈，乃得朋友介紹，服以『强斯登氏骨痛片』痛即停止，連服兩月，頓覺腰背爽健，骨節輕鬆，現已半載，從未一發云。</p>
<h3>大聲疾呼！　挽救白濁者所蹈的危險</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士（吳大超）</p>
<p>老實說：關於淋病自療法的評價，除了用黃色不和伐克辛成分之外，的確沒有最好的藥物了，我們也不必連篇累牘來宣傳某一種白濁藥為有效，某一種白濁藥為無效，因為這樣是無裨於患者的實益的。而對於醫學上的攻陷，太覺沒有價值了。我們要在患者取得有價值的信譽，當然要根據現實，太空汔而勉强牽涉或引證數種落伍的療法，雖然排滿了全版編幅，也無一顧的價值。因為每一種問題的貢獻，要久長使人贊好，當然要視該藥的成分是否確實有效，如僅：窮思極想作無謂的號召，不考究其藥力和成分，對於患者是百害而無一利的。</p>
<p>根據現實來闡明黃色素和伐克辛合製劑的效果，無需援用各醫家的臨床報告，祇須閉目一想，黃色素在各醫師的介紹如梅毒的與六〇六一樣眞人耳鼓，幾乎使人們不容遺忘，德國Jadassobn博士的發明黃色素伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』乃盡將精彩熔於一爐，我在香港醫大花柳院研究時，綜集各敎授的竟見，證明『安敵淋』的成分確有治淋的特殊功效，近數年來余屢藉此藥以辭脫患者的痛苦，從未遭遇失敗。</p>

<h3>德奧的健美運動</h3>
<p>— 英國BLONGAND-EVANS原著錄　賈治中醫師節</p>
<p>美容術發明的移步換形　駐顏術乳峯美為愛美女子所企求　不用手術效果確實為巴黎所不及</p>
<p>健美的姿態，為每個國家男女所企求。不過女性比較男子又來得希望熱切。所以美容術的發明，多數以女子為對象。巴黎對於美容術向以精進而馳譽全球。一九二九年法國斯脫克爾得氏C．R．Stockard與拉盤尼可羅氏G．N．RaPanicolaw首先發明用手術在耳際縫緊使額際所有皺紋完全消滅，不過不到兩年，反而比較原來所有的皺紋來得難看，依然證明手術美容法的失敗。況肚美容不單在於支掉若干皮膚上的皺紋即告成功，如臀部的發育，乳房的豐腴，和面容的紅潤，肌肉的飽滿，都非手術可以改造。此純為內分泌士大夫渴與生過去地腺衰頹問題。奧國生理學家斯丹那氏，對於內分泌學說的研究素著聲譽，彼使用生殖腺內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』以治乳房和臀部發育不全的女子，均能達到預斯的效果，同時因為有偉大促進新陳代謝的能力，可以長時間維持靑春的丰采。德國的美容專家修泰拿哈氏對於此法大為讚美，彼云：（除生殖素）之外，他種美容術殊無一顧的價值。』故彼盡力推行砦法，兩年中治愈不少的乳癌女子，等到現在，憶逐漸為各醫家所公認為助長發育的唯一可靠製劑，如常年服之，可使精神爽快，睡眠優良，食慾旺盛，容貌，皮膚，氣力皆呈靑年活潑狀態，便能無災無病，不知老期為何物。</p>
<p>獲得巴黎競美第一的奧國R．Shivoin小姐·在未參加此賽之兩月前，因乳峯發育未能使彼滿意，乃藉生殖腺素內分泌製劑女用『女用生殖素』之力，使乳峯驟然高聳，此誠科學之萬能也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>德意鼓勵生育</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>從前有一位道學先生，沒有兒子，請敎於　曉嵐，曉嵐答道，此事完全人欲，沒有天理，你時時拿天理二宇，擺在心上，所以養不出兒子，你看畜生，應時而動，百發百中，正以此也，由此看來，生育之道，純任自然，無可勉强，亦無可獎勵者也。</p>
<p>前日德國社會黨常年大會，於十二日賡續開會時，元首希特勒曾向二萬名女黨員發表演說，謂每一婦人，凡能產生健康活潑子女七人者，其對於吾民族所作之實獻，較諸最著名之女律師，實有過之無不及，希氏此言，深有至理，因為多一健全活潑的國民，卽國家多一分實力，這樣凡二萬的女子，每人生子女七人，則可得十四萬强壯的國民，則於卐字國旗之下，要平添多少異樣的光彩。</p>
<p>又十二日意國舉行會議，由首相墨紫里尼主席，通過意國增加出生率之新法令，嗣後政府與市政機關之位置，將儘先授予結婚者，而省政府市政府，均將加撥欵項，以充結婚與生育獎勵金之用？學生與一胎三兒之母　，政府將　以獎品，有子女八人之父親，將　免其兒女敎育費，這種新頒的法令，無非欲鼓吹生育，不但鼓吹生育，而生育之後，還設法替他們維持生活，這不是一個鼓勵生育仁至義盡的辦法麼？</p>
<p>因此我想到我國孟老夫子的學說，正與希墨二氏相同，孟子日，不孝有三，無後為大，無後為什麼是三不孝中最大不孝呢？孟老夫子雖沒有明言，無非是血統斷絕之後，祖宗就沒有吃羹飯的綠故，後人為色情狂者妙詮此義，一為天地造蒼生，二為祖宗延血脈，三為家庭敦倫常，但此種說數，還是當時宗去社會的說法，若以現在國家社會主義的意識來詮釋，必定一為人羣造福利，二為國家增實力，三為殺人儲利器，時代不同，故應用亦各異也。</p>
<p>希墨二氏為什麼要獎勵生育呢？無非欲戰爭，欲犧牲，欲效命疆塲，以達其野心勃勃的目的，和希望，惟現在是一個科學戰爭的世界，若戰端一開，無論戰敗的國家，必定犧牲無算，卽戰勝的國家，其損失亦將不計，故希墨二氏的獎勵生育，其實就是獎勵犧牲，德意的婦女乎？其勉力生育，母負希墨二氏之蘄望。</p>

<p>本市的民生簡便分堂，就在這情態之下，為着社會的饑餓羣面產生。該堂的主辦人，是凌有先君，一個普通的商人，但他頗熱心於社會事業。昨日我特走訪於他的寓所，詢問民生食堂的組織及槪況。他很透澈地述明了該堂創設的原因及內部的一切。</p>
<p>民生食堂的創辦，是具有二重的原因：（一）由着近年市面衰落，人民的生計日感困難，民生食堂的創辦，便希冀能直接減輕平民之消費。（二）欲使失業靑年減少生活痛苦，故食堂的服務人員，招收有志靑年，並加以訓練及敎育，務使有自進之機能。</p>
<p>民生食堂自開辦以來，已有年餘，就食者亦日漸遞增，由每日五六十人而加至二百餘人。食者大部份則係車夫，苦力及失業者。該食堂每日開售午晚二餐，午餐在上午十一時開始至下午二時為限，晚餐由下午六時至十時。食堂目下共有二處，場所均借用菜場。西門唐家灣菜場為第一食堂，陸家浜路利涉菜場為第二食堂，這二處的菜場，因均屬於慈善機關的管轄之下，所以在租用上很獲得便利。當二處菜場每日菜市完畢後就改為食堂。</p>
<p>食堂的服務人員，除廚伙外，二處共十餘人，都屬受過相當敎育的失業靑年。他們大都是感到了失業後生活的困難，所以都頗願意盡力服務，並不以為地位的低下而感着可恥。在待遇上，除了供給他們衣食住宿之外，並在晨間予以敎育。</p>
<p>該食堂的經費，據凌君所云：完全自行負責。在最近的統計，第一食堂每日約有就食者一百數十人，第二食堂約九十餘人，二處全計為二百餘人。堂內各項飯菜，悉以成本出售，每飯規定的價目，白飯每大罐售銅無十枚，中罐七枚，素菜每碟三枚，葷菜每碟八枚，湯每碗三枚，乳腐每塊十枚，普遍的就食者大槪一中罐白飯，一碟素菜，已能足够，故每餐所費可不逾四分。</p>
<p>同時我想知道食堂的設備起見，便想至唐良灣菜場觀第一食堂。那裏是沿着菜場的四周而圍成的一個極簡單的食堂。入口為購牌處，就食者須先向該處購牌，然後憑牌換取飯菜。內部的設備方面，也頗完備。盛飯菜的罐碟等，都係白色的磁具。菜蔬儲藏亦頗合於淸潔的條件。在食堂中，有木製長桌數張，可同時容納一百五十人的進餐。每日所發售的菜蔬，亦時常更換。素菜大都是豆芽，蔬菜，芋艿，豆腐，毛豆等。葷菜則有黃魚，鹹魚，醬煮肉絲等。各類的菜肉，完全採購新鮮者，且調味亦極予以注意，務使適於大衆的衛生及口味。</p>
<p>在食堂的南郊，並劃有停車場，因第一食堂晚餐的食客，大部為人力車夫。為免除車輛的失窮，該食堂特雇傭一人，代為看管。車夫在寄留時，取一牌號，領車時就以牌號換取。這樣，也就可使車夫安心進餐。</p>
<p>最後，我感到民生簡便食堂的創辦，的確是給予了都市貧苦者的絕大利益。可是，此種食堂在上海，似乎尙感缺乏，目下僅有南市二處，如果能使遍設至滬西，閘北，而達於全市，那才是都市平民的大衆幸福。</p>
<h3>猪</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>今年是豐年了。</p>
<p>禾田長得肥肥大大，穗頭飽滿得象珍珠米，那深深的橙黃的顏色耀得耕田佬的眼睛發這。在收穫的時候，人們是在唱和着山歌，心頭滿是高興地工作的。</p>
<p>現在，距離割完禾的時候，還沒有多久。榖粒已給打了下來，有些攤在禾場上矖着太陽，有些已用籮載起，準備　出去，和完糧了。</p>
<p>然而，正是這末個時候，米市給他們來了一個晴天霹靂。天早埋怨天，水大恨龍王作怪，但是，豐年了，榖價却從四元跌到三元六，氣得耕田佬個個眼睛突突。——這年頭兒，眞呌做有寃無路訴了。</p>
<p>豐收時的好景不知什末時候溜走了，人們的黧墨的臉孔，又上了一重鐵靑的顏色。陳家村又象暴風雨的前夜，給低低的黑雲蓋得密密實實了。在這下面的人們，透不過氣，連歎息也不敢大聲。</p>
<p>時間一天緊迫一天了，催糧的和收田租的帥爺下鄕來的消息，象崛尾龍作法那末地，翻騰了整個陳家村了。</p>
<p>桂叔想不出更好的辦法，只好硬着頭皮跟老婆商量。</p>
<p>「阿狗她，催的說不定這兩天下鄕來，今天剛碰到墟日，我想把你養的猪仔，也賣了再算。」</p>
<p>「你發　懂了嗎？」這個波娘可捨不得她自己辛苦養下來的猪他，便這樣回了。「他是我的命，我不賣！」</p>
<p>「不賣還不了稅啊！」</p>
<p>「呌他拿穀走好了。多收了幾擔又是不够，難道種田的還要賠了命嗎。我不賣！」</p>
<p>「阿狗她，這也沒有辦法啊！不要說猪仔，如果過了災年。阿狗賣了也還不了那要人命的租糧啊！」</p>
<p>這個在嘆息，那個可却嚎啕大哭起來了。</p>
<p>「天逼得我沒路走了。」</p>
<p>桂叔硬了頭皮，帶了那籠猪仔便氣噓噓里來。</p>
<p>他經裁縫鋪德記什貨店，陳老　通正在那里講新聞。——</p>
<p>「陳大牛的東家，那些矮傢伙嘿，聽說最近又搶去我們什末地方了。我記也記不得許多。省城的報紙賣得頂熱鬧哩！刁那媽個臭貨，現在他們運貨來不用納稅了，你看——」</p>
<p>用咀向對過那家剛開張不久的洋貨店一撇。</p>
<p>「祖宗十八代的從那里運來這些貨。他們賣的介賤，在我連本錢也不够。省城人呌這做走私，走你老母的爛臭X！」</p>
<p>這新聞的確很新。」一回兒便傳遍了全墟，人們都有點憤起來了。</p>
<p>「絕路了，橫好豎也是死，老子可顧不到那許多。</p>
<p>這是大牛他們的話，陳老通過時也微微地點了幾下頭。</p>
<p>桂叔不大明白老通他們講的話，他只當作那不過是一些「新聞」吧了。但是，後來在米行打探價錢的時候，他又聽到掌櫃們說着了。</p>
<p>「今年眞是黃瘟年！好好的年頭，倒是騙人的，連我們也不會想到，穀價跌得這末要命呢。」</p>
<p>「聽說有人在暗里操縱。」</p>
<p>「那華洋什貨店便派人出來　　了不少哩！」</p>
<p>「有人從中做鬼，那怪不得市面一剎變得這末混亂了！」</p>
<p>老的歎了一口氣，年靑的却瞪大眼珠，忿怒怒地咬實牙根，握着拳頭空搖了幾搖。</p>
<p>這上了年紀的耕田佬桂叔，心里也給說得　了花了。一股兒熱氣沖着他的喉頭，有點痕癢癢地。</p>
<p>來到猪欄，當掌櫃老伯說給他聽那個價錢時，他氣得靑也忍受不住地火直往上衝了。</p>
<p>「這不是一半不到嗎？」—他氣憤憤地賭氣般說着。</p>
<p>「是啊，桂叔！」收買猪仔的也知有他的苦衷。「不是我減你的價。實在沒有去路，省城也沒有市，我們可沒辦法哩！」</p>
<p>他的凡一硬，便想把猪仔了帶回去。但是，一轉念頭，那要人命的錢糧，又重重地敲着他的腦袋，眼前一黑，他再也管不到吃虧不吃虧了。他是這末象忍受什末天大的痛苦地說着：</p>
<p>「算了吧！」</p>
<h3>平凡的瑣事（續）</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>李美珍對我搖搖頭，呈現着不屑的樣子，表求她不愛聽那些東西。</p>
<p>她，二房東底獨女，是一個呌做什麼德的敎會中學校底高二生。</p>
<p>記得第一次對我表示好感，是因為我稱讀她有點像「珍妮麥唐納」，她喜歡極了。空閒下來的時候，就麗麗拉拉地成天兒唱着：「夢里情人底玉臂摟住我，……」仿佛她眞的已經做到那美國風流女明星一樣。—那時以淫蕩，色情，和肉慾風靡一時的「璇宮艷史」正在流行。它底麻痹人人底神經的毒素在都會底每個角落里瀰漫着。一些黑眼珠烏頭髪和黃皮膚的人們，都似乎忘記了那個給魔鬼扼住頸勃的死亡底末日了，祇是對這麻醉性的毒菌結了很深的友誼。……</p>
<p>假如菜販子陳各是在家的，（他底房間永遠充滿那辛辣而苦澀的朱廣蘭底烟　，）他一面抽着生切烟，一面好像煩厭極了，然而又悠適地說：</p>
<p>「好的公雞是不啼夜的。」</p>
<p>幾個鄰居的女人聚集在一起，就會喃喃地說着一些嫉妒的惡意的誹謗。</p>
<p>「那女的眞像一雙靑蛙。」</p>
<p>有人這樣說了</p>
<p>那女的是末曾完全懂事的大孩子，人情地故底陌生人。沒有交際手腕，少說讀，老是沈默着的。</p>
<p>「支明世界呀，摩登人物講究的是自由，——」</p>
<p>「嚀，合家剷的自由。」</p>
<p>「……自由戀愛，大家中意就可以住埋」（同居的意思啦，……）</p>
<p>「戀愛？……不要臉的東西，軋姘頭啊。」</p>
<p>「用不着你急呢，到那衰貨肚皮大起來的時候你就知道，等着瞧哪。」</p>
<p>對談的人們很興奮地結束了他們底話語。</p>
<p>我惘然，我眞不明白那些人為什麼對於新奇的東西，祇存着嫉妒，中傷，和破壞的心理。—大槪也是「狐貍說葡萄是酸的」之類的故事吧。</p>
<h3>漳浦</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>在我們閩南的鄕間，時常可以看到一種特別來得土頭腦的莊家人：他們的身體是異樣地强健漆黑，衣服也來得襤褸，後腦袋繞着一圈髮辮子，這就是出色的漳浦工。也許為着障浦那地方大閉塞了，或是土地療瘡，生活困　的緣故，他們總是　根　擔跟兩條麻繩子</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，以及一根插在腰邊褲帶裏的旱烟桿，就四出討活去。尤其是在夏秋兩收穫季節，幾乎遍地皆有這種莊稼人。在流浪的期間裏，他們這兒那兒被臨時雇着勞作；有時甚而不拿一文一錢而長期地給地主人家雇做長工（雇農），或給入贅在別人家去。他們是那樣地安於粗衣淡食，和勤於勞作，是如別的縣份莊稼人所趕不上的。</p>
<p>「去啦！到社裏廟口或大路上雇個漳浦工做做吧！」每當收穫季節，不僅地主富農人家，就是中農在農忙得不可開交時，也要這樣嚷起來。自家沒有兒子的，也時常這樣打算着：「漳浦工着實是不錯的，看看還是揀個年靑的招贅進來吧！一個人眞的要拖磨一世麼？」</p>
<p>的確，漳浦工的勞動力是駭人的堅韌：他們每天可以苦幹十四個鐘頭，而不懂疲勞。就像牛馬一般，他們沒過怒恨或嘆息。就因為這樣，那些雇主也不得不忍痛每天循例給與三頓飯跟兩頓點心吃：而一頓飯就須要一升米。</p>
<p>「眞像監牢裏剛放出來，一吃就六七大碗飯！」他們有時就這樣長伸着舌頭，可有什麼辦法呢？那來有像這種工人好雇？</p>
<p>漳浦工不管是大雨天或暴日下，他們總是赤着勝子工作着。他們不會歌唱，也很少交談：只有在吃飯過後，才蹲下抽兩口旱烟。在他們的單純腦筋裏，夏秋兩收穫季節，眞像一年中的黃金時代。他們總是在事前，就相互約定着，準備着扁擔和繩子：之後就三五成羣地朝百里多外的目的地——別的縣份，徒步出發了。在過去，他們被雇一整天，不僅有飯吃，且可掙到八毛錢；在那短短的個把月的收穫期問，十來塊錢是好容到手的。因而在返鄉的時候，我們總可以看到那漆黑而發亮的笑臉窩，和吊在扁担一頭用繩子紮着的布匹鞋子什麼。但近兩年來可呌他們失望了。無論他們怎樣　着乞憐的眼色，放低嗓子到處詢問工做，也沒有效力。何况工錢亦已由八毛丟落到四毛錢呢？那些僱主為什麼竟會變得這樣咎嗇？他們是理解得到的。但他們還是一季一季地四出討活，就像流落的北方人一樣，留留戀戀地。這也許是在他們的鄉問更糟，或是祈望會有好的景氣隆臨吧？</p>

<h3>關於「祖國」中國譯本之演出</h3>
<p>陳綿先生與唐槐秋先生是很有見解地决定了先選些粗綫條約心理劇，因為如此才能得釗觀眾的了解。</p>
<p>實在說起來，影戲的確使遠東人漸漸地明白了，我們的悲喜劇概括地論起來，影戲之對於戲劇，如同報紙上長篇小說之對於文學，那只是一個引人入勝的起源。</p>
<p>陳唐兩先生實在有見解，他們在北牛，南京，在內地，在上海，選譯同演出的都是些比較容易懂，情節動人，技巧結實的戲。他們演出了「茶花女」，這個在歐美都得到成功的戲。居然推遠到中國來了。</p>
<p>他們現在又把祖國供獻給倦們的圍　　　　如今要在法國演出這個戲，我們可以有許多意見，薩爾都的戲劇在一八七〇到一九一四年之間會受過很大的歡迎，不過現在我們覺得他有一點過時了。因為他的劇本的技巧太完備了，他的劇本　面一切都有着微細的計算來引起觀衆的好奇心，但這裏面缺少眞正動心的聲調。</p>
<p>薩爾都極注意舞台裝置與効果，這都是動人感觸的方法，以後恐怖派戲劇用的就是這個成法。「祖國」裏雖然沒有把密審空行刑的塲面實演出來，但是我們可以聽見受刑的呼聲，在「祖國」一幕窗外的紅光也可以使我們想見了燒人的柴堆，但　些効果的方法，只能受觀眾一個短時代的愛好。</p>
<p>薩爾都在四十年間是法國劇壇上最有權威的一個，現在他的「無拘束夫人（Madame　Sanssene））還有着很大的呌座能力。薩爾都實在說起來也不僅是一個技巧的作家，他也有靈魂，興趣同微細的觀察。他的喜劇，現在被遺忘是很不應該的，因為他的喜劇的確比他的悲劇强。他的「拉巴格」（Robagos），這個不朽的喜劇，假使有像杜蘭（Charles　Dullin）這樣的　劇家把他演出，誰敢說牠不能轟動一時呢？也　是我們的風俗演變了，六十年前能够引起滿院風雨的「拉巴格」，現在已不能使我們觀衆驚異了。</p>
<p>無論如何，　一　　　年還能以「毒藥案」一劇使全巴黎人興奮的薩爾都一定能得中國人士們的歡迎，因為他們還沒有對於這種技巧厭倦。再說他的技巧，也實在有使人認識的　値，還有「祖國」一劇裏面包含的愛國思想，更應得中國靑年的同情，</p>
<p>陳綿先生同唐槐秋先牛的努力，値得我們雙層的敬佩，因為他們把我們的戲劇藝術介紹給他們的國人，而且他們努力着創作新戲，我們國家添一個新的有個性的藝術。（完）（譯自九月十日上海法文日報）</p>

<p>「在歡之夜」取材於俄國大文豪果戈里所著的名劇「巡按」，是一部意美非常深刻的作品。</p>
<p>「在歡之夜」是給腐敗的政治一個惡毒的諷刺。</p>
<p>「狂歡之夜」是向媚上凌下的官塲投下一個有力的炸彈。</p>
<p>「在歡之夜」的對白，非常的詼諧幽默，使人興奮刺激。</p>
<p>「狂歡之夜」充滿着並不是胡鬧的滑稽，使你大笑，使你大怒。</p>

<h3>Our Garrison in Fengtai Completely Withdrawn; Moved to Zhao Jia Zhuang South of Fengtai; Order Maintained by Public Security Bureau; Garrison Numbers Also Extremely Small in Changxindian and Lugouqiao</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Fengtai was resolved peacefully yesterday after both sides sent representatives to negotiate. To avoid similar incidents from occurring again, troops from both sides have been stationed at more distant locations since yesterday. They have moved to Zhao Zhuang, south of Fengtai, for garrisoning. Sakurai, a Japanese advisor from the Political Council, and Mutaguchi and Nakajima, Japanese regimental commanders, who went to Fengtai for negotiations yesterday morning, returned to Ping separately yesterday and today to report. Kawabe, the commander of the Japanese brigade stationed in Ping, went to Tianjin this morning to meet with Tadiro, the commander of the garrison army, to report on the resolution of the incident. The Japanese side had deployed troops from Ping and Tong to Fengtai the night before. After the incident was resolved yesterday, they all returned to their original defenses. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Fengtai was resolved, the authorities on both sides, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future, decided after detailed discussions to move the two armies to more distant locations. Therefore, the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of our army, originally stationed in Fengtai, has been moved to Zhao Jia Village south of Fengtai. There are no traces of our army near the stationed Japanese army. Kawabe went to Tianjin at 9:00 am on the 20th to meet with Tadiro to report on the Fengtai incident. He left Tianjin in the afternoon to inspect Fengtai and returned to Ping at 6:30 pm in the evening. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fengtai, where Chinese and Japanese troops clashed on Friday, has now returned to normal. All Chinese troops in the Fengtai area were completely withdrawn this morning and are now stationed in Lugouqiao, several miles southwest of Beiping. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Brigade Commander Kawabe paid his respects to Tadiro and reported, then went to Fengtai on the 20th evening to deploy defenses. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Brigade Commander Kawabe, together with Chief of Staff Watanabe and Adjutant Ono, came to Tianjin at 12:00 noon on the 20th to pay respects to Tadiro and Hashimoto and report on the resolution of the Fengtai incident. Order in Fengtai has been restored on the 20th, and the city of Tianjin is calm and people are at peace. However, the military police of the Public Security Bureau's Security Command are still maintaining strict vigilance. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kawabe went to Tianjin today to pay respects to Tadiro and returned to Ping that evening. (20th Special Military Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Five Japanese military aircraft parked at Pingnan Yuan flew to Tianjin on the 19th, and all of them flew back to Ping on the 20th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 29th Army stationed in Fengtai moved to Zhao Jia Zhuang south of Fengtai, the 2nd battalion headquarters also moved at the same time. Currently, Fengtai only has the Supervisory Office under the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, with one inspector leading more than ten inspectors to take on the responsibility of inspection. The public security of Fengtai is currently maintained by the First Branch of the Wanping County Public Security Bureau. The number of garrisoned troops in Changxindian and Lugouqiao is also extremely small, with only Wang Xiu-chen's unit of the 8th company stationed in Lu, and a company of Pang Jianzhang's cavalry 1st brigade stationed in Chang.

According to reliable reports from relevant parties, the Japanese police officer was indeed shot and killed within the Japanese concession and could not have left his post while on duty. Within five minutes of the incident, Chinese and Japanese detectives gathered, and the deceased was lying on his back with bloodstains all around, so it was impossible to move the body and destroy the evidence so quickly. The situation described by Shirai, the Japanese vice consul in Hankou, may have been motivated by his emotions at the time. After a thorough investigation, the Japanese side has gradually understood the matter. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Today, Mayor Wu visited Consul General Miura at the Japanese Consulate General and expressed his condolences for this decisive incident.

<p>(Hankou) After Japanese police officer Yoshioka Teijiro was shot and killed at the intersection of Daisho Street on the Nisshin pier in the Japanese concession on the 19th, the Japanese police station believed that the cigarette vendors Huang Qingyun and Liu Shanya near the Nisshin pier needed to be questioned in order to obtain some clues from them. After the incident on the 19th, several suspects arrested by the Japanese police station were also detained at the Japanese police station. The Hankou Municipal Government specifically dispatched Secretary Zhang Jingxuan, together with Public Security Bureau Inspector Wang Yufen, Section Chief Dong Keren, and an interpreter, to the Japanese police station at 3:30 PM on the 19th to investigate Huang Qingyun and Liu Xiya's father with the Japanese police officers, survey the scene of the incident, and question the other four suspects in custody. The results are still pending further investigation. It is reported that Huang Qingyun is 73 years old and lives at No. 40, Lane 3, Xiahuapo, selling cigarettes and miscellaneous items for a living. Liu Xiya is only 9 years old, lives at No. 22, Yongqing Street, and is also a peddler. On this day, his father had other business to attend to, so he was managing the stall on his behalf. It was also found that the location where Yoshioka was shot and killed was at the intersection of Daisho Street, which was more than 300 meters away from the post of the 13th Branch Police Station. The reason why there was no post in between was because the Japanese Police Station Chief Ogawa notified the Public Security Fourth Bureau (now the Public Security 13th Branch) in 1928 that the post in this section should be removed and not allowed to be established because the area was within the Japanese concession.

<h3>Opening of the League of Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>— Should</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly opened in Geneva today. Among the issues to be discussed at this General Assembly, the most noteworthy major issue is the amendment of the League Covenant. Why is the amendment being proposed? Because the League of Nations used this tool to impose economic sanctions on Italy, which had no effect. After Italy occupied Abyssinia, the serious international situation forced the League of Nations member states to cancel the sanctions in a shameful manner. Therefore, some member states felt the need to amend the League Covenant. In fact, the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations were fully exposed when Japan occupied our four northeastern provinces, and this was determined by the nature of the League of Nations. Originally, the League of Nations was a product of the victory of pacifism. Its actual power was not in itself, but in the governments of its member states, and the political systems and national concepts of the member states were very contradictory and complex. Since the nature of the League of Nations is like this, it is feared that amending the League Covenant will not necessarily make it stronger. However, now that the crisis of a world war is imminent, the League of Nations, as a peace organization, is still what those countries that advocate maintaining international security and peace will try their best to support. We might as well leave it a glimmer of hope and agree to treat the amendment of the League Covenant as a remedy to try once.</p>
<p>The opinions proposed by our government regarding the amendment of the League Covenant are as follows: (1) The measures to prevent war contained in Article 11 of the League Covenant should be enriched as much as possible. The definition of aggressor countries should be clearly stipulated. Measures to prevent war should be implemented without the unanimous approval of the entire Executive Council. (2) Regarding the various sanctions measures contained in Article 16 of the League Covenant, it is advocated that a permanent committee of experts be established to formulate long-term and effective provisions so that the sanctions measures can be implemented automatically, immediately, and completely. (3) A special committee should be established to pre-determine the military sanctions measures that should be taken in an emergency.</p>
<p>Regardless of the possibility of these suggestions being passed by the General Assembly, in short, these are amendments proposed in response to the biggest shortcomings of the League Covenant. The current League Covenant provisions are indeed too general, and the various sanction procedures stipulated by the League Covenant are indeed too slow. If the Abyssinian war of aggression had no vested interests for countries such as Britain and France, perhaps they could even prevent the League of Nations from determining that Italy was an aggressor country. The fact that the economic sanctions against Italy were ineffective was obviously also because the slow procedures delayed the timing. Future international wars will definitely be more cruel than the last war in nature, and they will definitely be faster than the last war in strategy. If the League of Nations wants to effectively sanction aggressor countries, it must implement them very quickly. Therefore, it is really necessary for the League Covenant to be amended as suggested by our government.</p>

Unfortunately, the lady was unwell and returned to Guling yesterday. We hope that she will recover after convalescing in another place. We were warmly welcomed and well received in Guangzhou, and the deep friendship was indescribable. The agility of the police made me admire them endlessly. It is a pity that the mayor was unable to meet with us and the chairman and pacification director due to illness. The progress of Guangzhou's municipal administration and the greatness of the buildings such as Sun Yat-sen University and the Memorial Hall have left a deep impression on us. When we left the province, we were warmly sent off again. We hope that we will have the opportunity to visit this place again in the future and that these friends will be able to visit Hong Kong so that we can do our best as hosts.

<h3>Eastern Branch Line from Hebu to Manchuria Completed</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Harbin News, The Eastern Branch Line of the China Eastern Railway from Harbin to Manchuria was re-laid with a narrow gauge within five days by tens of thousands of conscripted soldiers and civilians by the Japanese puppet regime two weeks ago. South Manchuria Railway cars can drive directly from Dalian to the Russian-Manchurian border. This move is obviously in violation of the Japanese-Soviet purchase contract. The Soviet consul in Harbin has lodged a serious protest. In addition, the railway from Tianbaoshan on the shore of the Tumen River in eastern Jilin to Jiamusi has been built, which makes military transport more convenient. The Japanese puppet regime has completed hundreds of national defense strongholds along the Heilongjiang and Ussuri rivers, guarded by Japanese puppet soldiers, with beacon fires facing each other. The Soviet border feels great pressure. Clashes between the outposts of the two countries occur daily, but those that are not serious are kept secret. The movements of Soviet overseas Chinese in Harbin are strictly monitored, and less than a thousand people remain living there. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>How to Promote Rural Sidelines (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Qian Tianhe, Deputy Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station</p>
<p>Currently, our arable land, although felt to be insufficient, still has abandoned open space. Isn't this a contradictory phenomenon? No, because this open space either isn't easily suitable for growing crops, resulting in gains not covering losses, or the space is too small to be willing to cultivate. The former includes barren mountains and river beaches, while the latter includes spaces beside roads and surrounding vacant land. For example, we can use these places to plant castor beans. Castor beans don't discriminate between fertile and barren land and can be left to grow freely, while the castor oil market has great demand. Not only is it used as medicine, but its industrial applications are also increasing day by day. It certainly won't be oversupplied in the short term, so it's a good way for farmers to make a living. This is the third reason for promoting rural sidelines. (4) Processing Agricultural Products What do we mean by processing agricultural products? Let's take an obvious example: cotton is an agricultural product, and after spinning and weaving, it becomes yarn and cloth. This spinning and weaving is called processing. We feel that many agricultural products, such as fruits and vegetables, will spoil if they can't be sold in time. If they can be processed and manufactured, either pickled with salt or made into canned goods, and sold in the market, it will be possible to earn an extra sum. Everyone has eaten raisins, but most of them are foreign products. So why aren't we cultivating them extensively in our country, which is very suitable for cultivation? The biggest reason is that everyone isn't finding ways to process and manufacture them. Bumper harvests of rice and wheat turning into disasters are a common phenomenon in our country. If they can be processed and manufactured into wine, the wine can be sold for money, and the lees can be used to feed livestock, and the livestock can also be sold for money. The surplus labor can be used, and income can be increased considerably. Straw is fuel, but if it's processed and woven into straw sandals or twisted into straw ropes, its economic value will also definitely increase considerably. There are also many agricultural products that aren't worth much money, but after processing, their value will suddenly increase several times. For example, straw hats. Their raw materials are very cheap, but after they're made, they can be sold for one yuan to dozens of yuan each. Therefore, processing agricultural products that can be processed or are worth processing is also a good rural sideline. This is the fourth reason for promoting rural sidelines.</p>
<p>(5) Recovering Lost Revenue Since China opened up trade with foreign countries, foreign goods have gradually occupied our country's market. At first, it was limited to big cities, but in recent years, due to the development of roads and other reasons, foreign goods have gradually penetrated into the countryside. Not only have the original local goods been defeated by them, reducing income for farmers, but farmers have also had an extra expense, accelerating their bankruptcy. According to the agricultural report in the eighth issue of the fourth volume of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, based on the reports of more than 6,000 agricultural reporters in 22 provinces nationwide in April 1935, farm households that purchased foreign cloth accounted for 30% of all farmers, and those using woolen fabrics accounted for 9.6% of the total. On average, each middle-class farm household in the 22 provinces needed 6.8 jin of foreign sugar and 27.3 jin of kerosene per year. In the past, all these supplies could be self-sufficient, but now they have to rely on foreign goods. With such a large loss every year, how can the countryside not be in slight bankruptcy, and how can the country not be impoverished?</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many local goods that China originally had. Why are they being squeezed out by foreign goods? It's not that the people love to use foreign goods; it's really because local goods aren't strong, not beautiful, or the value is too high. Therefore, we should now improve the original local goods, making them strong and beautiful, and making them cheaper than foreign goods. The sales channels can naturally be slowly restored. For example, Wuxi clay figurines are very famous, but outside of Wuxi, it's not easy to see them. What we see are foreign figures of people, birds, and animals made of chemical materials, which are both beautiful and inexpensive, so the sales channels are very good. What's the reason? It's that the people who make clay figurines in Wuxi aren't willing to research improvements, change the patterns, strive for beauty and low prices, and pay attention to sales methods. If the people who make clay figurines in Wuxi can strive to improve on the one hand and find ways to open up sales channels on the other, we believe that they can definitely reduce a portion of imported children's toys. There are also many new sidelines that can be promoted and are effective because the market needs them. For example, Japan exports 4 million goldfish to foreign countries every year, worth 500,000 yuan. Especially in the United States, the sales channels are the widest because Americans have money and goldfish are very fun to play with, so this good business has been completely occupied by the clever Japanese. But our country has paid little attention to this sideline so far. For example, the wives of professors at Yenching University in Beiping use ramie fabric as raw materials to teach women in the rural areas of Beiping to weave all kinds of tablecloths and table mats. Westerners like these tablecloths and table mats very much. Almost everyone who goes to visit the school buys a few to take back. But there are no sales outlets for these tablecloths and table mats that meet the psychology of Westerners in places with many Westerners, such as Shanghai. If "Jiangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces that originally produced ramie fabric use the farmers' spare time and labor to promote the weaving of tablecloths and table mats, in addition to supplying Westerners in China and so-called high-class Chinese for purchase, they can also be sold to the West. Isn't this a way to recover some of the lost revenue? This is the fifth reason for promoting rural sidelines.</p>
<p>The five reasons for promoting rural sidelines have already been stated, but to summarize, it's all for the sake of increasing the income of farmers. Because the foundation of the country is built on farmers, and if farmers' livelihoods aren't prosperous, it will be very difficult for the country to become prosperous!</p>
<p>3. How to Promote Rural Sidelines</p>
<p>(1) Prerequisites for promoting rural sidelines:</p>
<p>(A) It must be able to truly connect with the industrial sector This topic seems difficult to understand at first glance, but it's actually very simple. Now let's give a few examples to illustrate: For example, silk. Farmers raise silkworms and sell the cocoons to silk factories for reeling silk. This has a history of many years. But in the past few years, silk prices plummeted, many silk factories closed down, and the cocoons that farmers worked hard to harvest sold for too little money, making them feel that the gains didn't cover the losses. Many farmers resentfully chopped down mulberry trees and stopped raising silkworms. Last year, silk prices suddenly soared, and silk factories all opened up, but there was a shortage of raw materials, and some silk factories still had to close. This situation was indeed affected by the world economy, but a lack of communication with each other was also a major reason. For example, matchboxes are mostly contracted out to poor families in the city by match factories. The living standards of poor families in the city are high, and the wages paid by match factories are low, so they are constantly complaining. If it were entrusted to rural areas, the living standards in the countryside would be low, and farmers could use their spare time, and there would be more people. The wages wouldn't need to be increased, and the output could be increased rapidly. Farmers would have a stable sideline and could earn a certain income. It would be a real benefit for both sides. Therefore, if we want to promote sidelines, we must be able to connect with the industrial sector.</p>
<p>(B) It must meet market needs and have the possibility of expanding sales channels When we promote rural sidelines, we must see whether the products of this sideline meet market needs and whether there is the possibility of expanding sales channels. For example, weaving native cloth as a sideline. Now the native cloth market has been encroached upon by foreign cloth and machine-woven cloth. If we blindly promote it, it will definitely fail. For example, castor oil. The market needs it very much now, and we are making every effort to promote the cultivation of castor beans to meet the demand, so of course we will only make a profit. This is the result of the former not meeting market needs and the latter meeting market needs. For example, weaving cattail bags in salt-producing areas. These cattail bags are specially used for packing salt. We think that the number of cattail bags used for packing salt every year is very large, so we vigorously promote weaving them. The output has increased, but in addition to packing salt, there are no sales channels for other reasons, such as inconvenient transportation and the lack of sales organizations. This kind of promotion will definitely fail. But if we manufacture paper umbrellas, the sales channels for paper umbrellas have not only been strong domestically in recent years, but exports have also been increasing day by day. We hope that this sideline will have great hope if we promote and improve it. This is a real example of the former having narrow sales channels and being difficult to expand, and the latter having broad sales channels and being expandable.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Council Passes Opium Report; Expresses Gratification at China's Anti-Smoking Plan; Ironclad Evidence Obtained of Japanese Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a public meeting today and passed a report on the opium trade, expressing keen concern for the situation in China. The report stated that there is now clear evidence that opium production is being carried out on a large scale both north and south of the Great Wall, and that foreigners are secretly manufacturing and widely distributing narcotic drugs. The Council expressed satisfaction with the Chinese government's six-year plan to ban opium planting and smoking. The report mentioned Japan, stating that there is now ironclad evidence that people are engaged in organized drug trafficking, especially of "Heroin" manufactured in Japan, in North America, India, and other parts of the Far East.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a closed meeting again at about 5:00 PM. The Romanian Foreign Minister, Mr. Antonescu, proposed that the Council appoint British Lord Hailey as a member of the League of Nations Mandates Commission. At 5:15 PM, the Council held a public meeting, the 93rd session of the Council, chaired by the Argentine Foreign Minister, Mr. Lamas. The Italian representative was still absent. The public meeting today was very short, with only the Portuguese representative, Mr. de Vasconcelos, presenting a report on the work of the Opium Committee and the Committee on the Prohibition of Narcotics, which was quite optimistic. The whole meeting unanimously approved the report, and the Council adjourned at 6:00 PM. The date of the next meeting has not been set, but the General Assembly of the League of Nations is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM next Monday. According to custom, the opening ceremony of the General Assembly must be held in the afternoon, but this decision was made to advance it in particular. It is expected that after the opening of the General Assembly, the Credentials Committee will work quickly to decide on the issue of whether the Abyssinian delegation can attend.

<h3>Hopeful that China Will Be Elected as a Semi-Permanent Member</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The 17th General Assembly of the League of Nations will be held in Geneva on the 21st. Our representatives Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, and Jin Wensi have arrived one after another. The agenda of the General Assembly will first be addressed by the acting chairman, who will describe the achievements of the League of Nations over the past year and hopes for the future, followed by the election of the official chairman and vice-chairmen. Among the issues to be discussed, the only one related to us is the issue of China becoming a semi-permanent member, which is generally expected to pass. As for amending the Covenant, our government has sent a written opinion. According to those familiar with diplomacy, it is imperative that the League of Nations increase its organizational strength. At the same time, the voice of Italy's return to the League of Nations has been realized. However, amending the Covenant is the first amendment to the League's own organization since its establishment and cannot be determined in a hasty time. It will generally be referred to the First Committee (discussing legal matters) for lengthy exchange of views. The General Assembly, according to past practice, has six committees and a special committee of the agenda committee. This year, it is said that it will discuss the general issue of international economic coordination. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Center of European Political Activity Shifts to Geneva; League of Nations General Assembly Opens Today; Major Issues of Disarmament, Economy, and Covenant Amendment to Seek International Coordination</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The center of European political activity will shift to Geneva tomorrow, as the League of Nations General Assembly will open on this day in a very threatening environment and hold important meetings. The Spanish civil war, the war talks in Nuremberg and Moscow, the world's frenzy of rearmament, and the tense situation in Palestine will all be ominous backgrounds for the General Assembly's discussions. However, it seems that none of these serious issues will be raised for direct discussion. In order to make the General Assembly aim at one goal in addition to its usual work, the French government plans to urge the members to take joint action on the three major issues of disarmament, economic rectification, and League of Nations reform. Regarding disarmament, the first step seems to be to re-establish the Third Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly, which has not met since 1932. The second issue is economic rectification, and French economists are quite optimistic about the prospects for this. They believe that it is urgent today to reconvene an international conference to seek the restoration of the free flow of trade and the stability of currency exchange rates. As for the League of Nations reform plan, the General Assembly has now received 18 written opinions, which will be submitted to the First Committee for separate consideration after a general discussion.

<h3>Powerful British Delegation Departs for Geneva; Eden Lays Over in Paris for a Short Stay</h3>
<p>(London) The main figures of the British delegation have departed from London for Geneva. This is one of the most powerful British delegations ever sent to Geneva. The delegation includes Dominion Minister Malcolm MacDonald, Financial Secretary to the Treasury Morrison (Mr. Morrison served as chairman of the International Committee for the Implementation of the Non-Intervention Agreement in the Spanish Civil War), and Lord Cranborne of the Foreign Office, who has arrived in Geneva to represent Britain at the League of Nations Council meeting. In addition, there is also Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords Halifax, who is scheduled to depart from London today. The head of the delegation, Foreign Secretary Eden, will first fly to Paris today and then take a train to Geneva at night. After arriving in Paris, the Foreign Secretary plans to meet with French Prime Minister Blum, who seems unable to come to Geneva for the time being. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Abyssinian Issue at the League: Lengthy Credentials Review, Rome Expresses Firm Opposition</h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the 17th regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly opens tomorrow morning, it will immediately appoint a "Credentials Committee" to review the credentials of representatives from various countries. The credentials of the Abyssinian representative will be the most troublesome, and it is unknown whether they will be considered valid. The expected solutions are no more than three: (1) Recognize the Abyssinian representative's credentials as valid, but this is highly unreliable. (2) If the committee's opinions are inconsistent, two reports should be prepared, one representing the majority opinion and the other the minority opinion, both to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, or a statement that the matter is of a purely political nature, to be handled by the General Assembly. (3) The Abyssinian representative's credentials are deemed invalid. Regarding this point, the Abyssinian delegation, or another delegation, may make a request, and be supported by other countries, to submit the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to determine whether denying the Abyssinian Emperor's appointed representative the right to attend raises the issue of non-recognition of the government formed by the Emperor. In addition, there is another matter, whose political implication, though weaker, is equally difficult to handle: the selection of the "Credentials Committee" members. According to the rules of procedure of the League of Nations General Assembly, this committee should be composed of eight members. Currently, England, France, Peru, and Hungary have already submitted their candidacy. It is yet to be determined whether other countries will step forward to fill the remaining four seats. In short, tomorrow's meeting is bound to be interesting, and the League of Nations General Assembly, in order to allow the committee sufficient time to deliberate and draft a report, will likely postpone the discussion of this report until tomorrow afternoon. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Noted journalist Gaeta, mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published an article in the Italian Daily, stating: "As long as the Abyssinian delegation is in Geneva, Italy will not participate in the work of the League of Nations. The Abyssinian regime has now been overthrown forever. Italy does not seek recognition from others for its sovereignty over that land, but if a group of exiles emerges to represent this regime, Italy cannot recognize it. Italy has now occupied Abyssinia and will continue to occupy it without hesitation. This is the main fact. Other countries' recognition is crucial to us, even more so than it is to other countries, because if other countries do not clearly recognize the system that Italy is implementing in Abyssinia, Italy will not recognize the rights and interests that other countries enjoy in Abyssinia." His conclusion was: "Some say that the Italian Empire must expand outwards and that it will harm the interests of other European countries, regardless of size or strength. This is absolutely incorrect. However, Italy will act differently if it is forced by other countries." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Re-allocation of Colonies: Poland Desires a Share, Requests a Seat on the Mandates Commission, Poland and Romania Aim to Strengthen Old Alliance</h3>
<p>(Paris) A "Journal" reporter, Saint-Brice, recently declared that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has submitted a request to the League of Nations, stating that his country should serve as a member of the League of Nations Mandates Commission. "Colonel Beck's actions are intended to reaffirm that when colonial territories are re-allocated in the future, Poland should also have a share. There are no other related manipulations involved. However, one thing that cannot be ignored is that Colonel Beck's first meeting in Geneva was with Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu. This is very meaningful, because Poland and Romania were originally allies, but due to Soviet interference, relations have cooled. To this day, Poland wants to strengthen the alliance between the two countries." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck today and discussed matters. Beck will have briefed Delbos on the progress of Poland's negotiations with Germany regarding the Danzig issue.

<h3>Supplying Arms to Rebels: Spanish Representative to File Complaint with League</h3>
<p>(Geneva) There is much fear here today that the Spanish government will condemn the League of Nations, citing other countries' assistance to the rebels. It is understood that when Spanish Foreign Minister del Vayo speaks at the League next week, he may raise the issue of other countries supplying arms to the rebels. However, observers do not believe that Spain will formally request the League of Nations to intervene in the Spanish Civil War. The International Red Cross announced today that the leaders of both sides in Spain have agreed to respect the international safety agreement to move women and children out of the war zone. The association has also decided to ask the Red Cross societies of various countries to provide relief to the refugees on both sides. It is claimed that Spanish Prime Minister Caballero has agreed with General Cabanillas, the provincial governor of the rebel faction in Burgos, to allow the Red Cross, under the guidance of Swiss national Dr. Junod, to work in the war zone. Both sides guarantee that soldiers who are injured and unable to fight will be neutral, and guarantee respect for prisoners of war and the Red Cross staff's markings. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<h3>Locarno Conference: Italy's Conditions for Participation, Mediterranean Issue Must Be Resolved First, British Note Does Not Offer Any New Proposals</h3>
<p>(Rome) The "Battaglia Padana" recently published an editorial stating, "Italy's participation in the Five-Power Locarno Conference should, at present, take the resolution of the Mediterranean issue as a prerequisite, because the situation in the Mediterranean has changed greatly since Italy conquered Abyssinia. The United Kingdom previously attempted to establish a collective security system but failed. Now it is inviting Italy to participate in a regional security plan (referring to the New Locarno Pact), and this region is geographically unrelated to Italy. According to diplomatic tradition, the most urgent issues are the various consequences directly arising from the war. Now, after the end of the Abyssinian War, the most pressing issue is the Mediterranean issue, not the Western European issue. If the Mediterranean issue is not resolved, Geneva has not yet made a legal settlement on Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, and the United Kingdom's policy towards the Red Sea, which is controlled by Italy, is still undecided. How can Italy participate in the New Locarno Conference under such circumstances? From this perspective, the preparations for the Five-Power Conference must still be awaited." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British government sent a note to the French, Belgian, Italian, and German ambassadors to the United Kingdom yesterday, which was forwarded to their respective governments. The note has been read by French Foreign Minister Delbos. It is reported that the content of the note is based on the communique issued by the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium at the London Conference on July 23rd, urging countries to hold the Five-Power Locarno Conference as soon as possible. In addition to reiterating the content of the July 23rd communique, it did not contain any new proposals. In short, the British note is intended to probe the attitude of the countries concerned towards the Five-Power Conference. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Another Report from Berlin: Stalin Seriously Ill, Successor Being Considered</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to the "Berliner Tageblatt," from absolutely reliable sources, Stalin is suffering from endocarditis and is seriously ill. The issue of his successor is already being discussed internally. It is reported that the most promising candidate is Voroshilov, the Commissioner of the People's Defense Committee. Voroshilov's views often differ from Stalin's, especially regarding Stalin's agricultural policy, which Voroshilov believes is likely to undermine the morale of the Red Army. If Voroshilov succeeds Stalin, there will be a major reform of the Soviet government's internal affairs. There are no provisions in the constitution regarding the selection of a successor, because Stalin, although the most authoritative person in Soviet Russia today, holds no position in the government. He is merely the General Secretary of the Communist Party. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Left-Wing Extremists' Revolutionary Plot Discovered, Arms and Documents Seized</h3>

<h3>Former Romanian Foreign Minister Gradually Recovering After Three Blood Transfusions, Still Concerned About the International Situation While Ill</h3>
<p>St. Moritz, Switzerland. Former Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, who is recuperating here, is extremely weak. After the doctor gave him a third blood transfusion this afternoon, he showed slight improvement. The patient is very lucid. Even while ill, he asked those attending to him about the League of Nations meeting and off-site negotiations today. Today, the Romanian Orthodox Church held prayers in churches across the country, praying for Titulescu's speedy recovery. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of the Austrian Heimwehr: Originally a Paramilitary Group, Now Sharing the Fate of the German Stahlhelm</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Since the Vienna branch of the Patriotic Heimwehr requested the reinstatement of former Interior Minister Major Fey as the leader of the branch, internal disputes have arisen. Our reporter recently reported on the history and current status of the Heimwehr. The Patriotic Heimwehr was founded in 1919 and was originally a purely paramilitary group. Its purpose was to resist Yugoslavia's attempt to re-incorporate part of Carinthia, which was ceded to Yugoslavia after the war, into Austrian territory. It then became a political civic group. At that time, the Heimwehr's provincial branches acted independently and had no central organization. It was not until 1932, after the former cabinet advisor, Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Home Guard, and his political friends reorganized it, that they united and restored its original paramilitary nature. Since then, the group has played an important role politically, competing with the Social Democratic Party's Schutzbund. Later, the Schutzbund gradually lost ground and was finally dissolved along with the Social Democratic Party in 1933. As for the Heimwehr, it assisted former Chancellor Dollfuss with force in dealing with the Social Democratic Party and the National Socialist Party during the Social Democratic Party incident in February 1934. Dollfuss' position was thus consolidated, and the foreign and financial policies he advocated were able to succeed. When current Chancellor Schuschnigg succeeded as Prime Minister, he began to organize the Patriotic Front and eradicated all paramilitary groups. This move was a fatal blow to the Patriotic Heimwehr. To this day, the Heimwehr has practically ceased to exist. In addition, there are deep disagreements between Prince Starhemberg and the leaders of the provincial branches. It is expected that the group will meet the same fate as the German Stahlhelm and withdraw from the political and military stage. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Far East Air Force Commander Inspects Hong Kong Air Defense, Departs from Singapore Today, New Airfield Being Built Hurriedly in Beihuan</h3>
<p>(Singapore) Air Vice-Marshal Smith, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force Far East, will lead two flying boats of the 205th Squadron from here to Hong Kong tomorrow to inspect the local air defense and personnel. The new air force barracks and technical facilities built there have now been completed. A new airfield is being built in Beihuan (transliteration), a British leased territory in the hinterland adjacent to Hong Kong. Currently, Hong Kong has a small Royal Air Force base, and all of its aircraft belong to the fleet. It is expected that a squadron or two of the Royal Air Force will soon be stationed in Hong Kong to cooperate with Singapore. Smith will visit Vietnam, the Philippines, British North Borneo, and Sarawak when he flies back to Singapore from Hong Kong. Smith will inspect the recently built military airfield in Sarawak.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Europe Study How to Jointly Face National Crisis, General Assembly Held in Paris</h3>
<p>(Paris) Chinese expatriates in Europe held a general assembly here today to "exchange opinions and study ways to jointly face the national crisis." Chinese representatives from the World Youth Assembly (held in Geneva on the 1st of this month) and the World Peace Movement Assembly (held in Brussels, Belgium, on the 3rd of this month) also came to participate. Many representatives expressed their opinions, saying that it is necessary for China and European countries to promote friendly relations. Chen Mingshu, a key figure in the former 19th Route Army, encouraged his compatriots to unite sincerely and work hard to organize so that they can serve the country as quickly as possible in the event of an emergency.

<h3>Japan's Southern Advance Policy: Adopts External Relaxation and Internal Tightening Measures, Focuses on Economic Aggression</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign and Navy Ministries, in view of the concerns of countries related to Japan's southern advance policy in the South Pacific, are actively strengthening their national defense. For example, Australia's three-year naval and air force expansion plan, the Dutch East Indies' ten-year national defense plan, and the Philippines' thirty-year national defense plan are all aimed at preventing Japan's advance. They believe that the extension of the British and American air routes poses a threat of air strikes to the mandated territories. Therefore, they have decided to establish a southern advance policy focused on economic development in the near future, adopting "external relaxation and internal tightening" measures to gradually dispel the atmosphere of fear of Japan. It is reported that the Foreign and Navy Ministries have reached a consensus on this. (China United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Encircle Madrid, Government Troops Attack Ancient Fortress with Fire but Still Fail to Capture It, Chilean Ambassador Requests Temporary Ceasefire</h3>
<p>Madrid. According to the Burgos rebel headquarters, the revolutionary army is preparing for a final attack and will encircle Madrid. The northern wing of the rebels has occupied Navaflorija, penetrated the Lozoja Valley south of the Guadarrama Mountains, and occupied Madrid's main reservoir, threatening the rear of the government troops. General Franco's southern column has reportedly occupied two major lines of advance. One army is advancing past San Martin and Yglesias, 36 miles west of Madrid, and the other is departing along the road to Toledo. Meanwhile, the Tétouan rebel radio station broadcast that the revolutionary warship "Méndez Núñez" had received official confirmation that the Madrid government's fleet had sailed to Arziel, a French naval base, to negotiate the terms of surrender to the revolutionary army. Also, according to a report received in Burgos today from the Barl telegram, Vicha Island in the Balearic Islands has been reoccupied by the revolutionary army. It is reported that the Catalan column that withdrew from the island has re-boarded its ship and set sail for Barcelona. Chilean Ambassador to Madrid, Mr. Morgado, is again engaged in rescuing the women and children of the rebels in the Alcázar fortress, intending to have both sides cease fire for 24 hours to allow the women and children to leave the fortress. The ambassador convened a diplomatic corps meeting for this purpose and telegraphed Chilean representative to the League of Nations Executive Council, Mr. Vicuña, saying that if the Alcázar fortress ceased fire for 24 hours, it "could save the lives of 900 women and children on the verge of death." Currently, government troops are bombing the fortress with explosives, and the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Attacking Ancient Fortress with Fire: Government Troops Use Gasoline in Combat</h3>
<p>Toledo. After the commander of the government troops attacking the Alcázar fortress ordered the use of gasoline in combat, the ruins of the fortress are now surrounded by thick smoke and flames. Today, firefighters dug trenches around the fortress, poured thousands of gallons of gasoline into them, and then ignited them with bombs. Instantly, the flames soared into the sky and were impossible to approach. At the same time, bullets rained down on the fortress. In the midst of this tension, a brave man from the rebels rushed out from the rain of bullets, seized the oil hose from the firefighters, and poured it towards the government troops. However, he was shot all over his body, fell to the ground, and died. This plan to attack with fire still failed to allow the government troops to occupy the fortress, so the government troops stopped using this tactic. Some of the rebels later attempted to break through, but were driven back by a barrage of gunfire, with many casualties. Now, the explosives of the Asturias miners have blasted a gap in the wall of the fortress. Government troops have installed machine guns at the gap, preparing for a decisive attack. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Toledo. Although the Alcázar fortress here has been mined and destroyed by government troops, the rebels are still putting up a final stubborn resistance. The bloody battle between the two sides has not stopped. Last night, rebels from the palace attacked the former Governor-General's office to the left of the Alcázar through a tunnel, setting up machine guns for defense. At dawn today, the government mobilized the assault teams and bomb squads of the "Iberian Anarchist Federation" to continue the attack with a large number of hand grenades and bombs. Government General Asensio arrived here last night and found a way to burn down the left corner of the Alcázar and the Governor-General's office without any danger. The method was to use two large water trucks filled with gasoline, connected by a long cloth pipe. The oil pipe passed through the roof of the Santa Cruz Monastery. After the soldiers lit the end of the pipe, they poured it into the Governor-General's office. Just as the oil pipe reached the front of the building, it was spotted by the rebels inside. The rebels bravely seized the oil pipe and changed its direction, making it shoot towards the government side. However, because the government troops fired with rifles, the rebels holding the oil pipe were shot down before long. The rebels inside the building then went downstairs, launching a surprise attack on the government troops with rifles and machine guns. After the government troops threw hand grenades, the rebels retreated. There were many rebel deaths, but no government troops died. Until noon, the battle was very fierce, with bombs exploding everywhere. The rebels were forced to abandon the roof of the Governor-General's office and guard it with machine guns on the ground. Government troops also rebuilt the ramparts and used cannons to shoot at the Governor-General's office. At this time, the rebels retreated into the building, and the sound of gunfire subsided. Government troops seized the opportunity to move forward, dig a hole in the wall, and throw bombs into the building. However, because the walls were very thick, the damage from the bombing was not very great. Currently, the rebels have completely stopped firing. Government troops are seizing the opportunity to aim machine guns at all the doors of the office. When the Havas News Agency reporter left Toledo, it was nearly dusk. The whole city was filled with smoke, and although it had been raining heavily all day, the fighting had not stopped. Today, the reporter witnessed another extremely cruel scene. A militiaman of the government army said to the reporter, "Do you want to see a cruel scene? Please come with me." The reporter followed the militiaman and entered a coffee shop opened by a Swiss man at the corner of the Sagador Square near the Governor-General's office. The militiaman then took me up a bullet-scarred ladder to a window upstairs, where I saw a window with iron bars on the opposite Alcázar Palace ruin. A woman was shouting inside the bars, "Comrades, save my life! Please, for the sake of your mother, let me out! Without these iron bars, I would rather jump down and commit suicide!" She called for help for half an hour, but the militiaman was unable to get close to the window to rescue her. When the woman became exhausted, she stopped shouting and waved her hand outside the iron bars for help. Soon, the woman disappeared. The reporter and the militiaman did not notice whether she had fallen to the ground after being shot or had been forced to leave the window by the rebels who had spotted her. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Naval Port of Bilbao Under Blockade</h3>
<p>General Deliano, Commander of the Nationalist Andalusian Division in Burgos and member of the military government, recently announced in a radio broadcast that the Nationalist cruisers "Cervantes" and "España" have blockaded the northern port of Bilbao. Since the fall of San Sebastián, the port of Bilbao has been flooded with refugees, numbering as many as 37,000, leading to severe food shortages and a precarious situation. According to news from Valladolid, the northern Nationalist headquarters, General Mola, Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Army, sent planes yesterday to drop leaflets over Bilbao and Santander, stating that if the defending forces surrender before the 25th of this month, the Nationalists will not investigate past actions upon entering the cities, but looting will not be tolerated. A radio broadcast from Nationalist authorities in Cádiz in the south also reported that Nationalist forces in Oviedo in the northwest, led by Colonel Aranda, engaged and defeated government troops outside the city yesterday, advancing to within 27 kilometers of the city. Furthermore, Nationalist operations in western Malaga and Badajoz provinces in the south are progressing successfully. Reportedly, a Mexican ship carrying a shipment of arms and ammunition has arrived at Cartagena in the southeast to supply government forces. According to a radio broadcast from Nationalist authorities in A Coruña in the northwest, several members of the Catalan Autonomous Government have fled, and Premier Companys is also considering leaving against the opposition of anarchists in the province. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz: It is reported here today that residents of Bilbao are terrified upon learning that the rebel leader has issued an ultimatum, stating that unless they surrender immediately, a bombardment even more intense than that of Irún will be carried out. Adding to their anxiety, the rebel warships "España" and others have begun shelling government positions in the mountains east of the city. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<h3>Italian Flag Flies in the Wind on Spanish Island of Majorca; Italian Troops Arrive as if in Conquered Territory</h3>
<p>Barcelona, Spain: The Catalan Autonomous Government previously dispatched a detachment to the Spanish island of Majorca in the Mediterranean (part of the Balearic Islands) to suppress the rebels, but it failed and returned. According to "Solidaridad Obrera," the organ of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (anarchist faction), a unit of Italian troops, led by Lieutenant Rossi, has arrived on the island as if entering a conquered territory. Lieutenant Rossi has also become a dictator. However, the Spanish flag is still displayed alongside the Italian flag. After government planes had previously resolved to bomb the island, several Italian planes arrived. A prominent Spanish banker, March, known for providing financial support to the rebels, also reportedly visited the island with planes he had purchased. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>Franco-Spanish Border Not Closed; Standing on International Bridge Prohibited</h3>
<p>Bayonne, France: All but two routes along the Franco-Spanish border were originally scheduled to be closed last night. However, after the government considered that the closure of the border would be detrimental to the people on the French side of the border, it temporarily reversed the decision. The Franco-Spanish border was not closed last night. However, due to incidents involving Spanish refugees and militia retreating on the international bridge leading to Irún, public safety authorities have ordered that people are prohibited from standing on the international bridge. A French national named Archillaire in Tetouan, Spanish Morocco, was killed earlier this month. Negotiations with the Spanish authorities regarding this case are reportedly nearing resolution, and it is expected that the Spanish authorities will allocate funds to compensate the bereaved family.

<h3>Bishop of London Pleads for British Refugees; Appeals for Public Donations for Relief</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, all local newspapers disclosed a circular signed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Archbishop of Westminster, and other clergy, pleading for British refugees fleeing Spain. The circular stated that many refugees who have returned to Britain are destitute and in dire need of food and clothing, and urged the public to donate generously for relief. It also stated that there are currently about 400 such refugees, whose lives depend entirely on charitable donations. In addition, there are hundreds more stranded in Gibraltar and Marseille, who also require the assistance of philanthropists. The circular further stated that most of these British refugees fleeing Spain owned property or businesses in Spain, and were forced to abandon all their assets, even the smallest items, when they fled. A committee has been established to handle relief efforts for these refugees. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Ministry Actively Implements First Replenishment Plan; Completion of the Establishment of Air Groups</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Under the Second Replenishment Plan of the Naval Ministry, the last two land-based air group bases, those of Yokohama and Chinkai, have been completed. The opening ceremonies are scheduled for October 1st. These bases will increase the power of the naval air force as purely operational units on the front line. According to the plan stipulated by the Navy, the construction of air group bases has been completed. Yokosuka and Kashiwa will serve as training air groups to train personnel, while Tateyama and ten other units will be operational units to accommodate graduates of the training air groups and engage in field training. Meanwhile, under the ongoing First and Second Replenishment Plans, the establishment of air groups has also been completed. The budget allocated to each air group base will allow for the completion of 35 units by the end of this year. After completing the establishment and deployment of four more units next year, the planned full strength of 39 units will be achieved. Future replenishment plans will focus on enriching the content of existing air groups, focusing on the research of equipment and the training of personnel. (Domei, 20th)</p>
<h3>Hurricane on the US Atlantic Coast Turns Northeast; Material Losses of 500 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(New York) The most violent hurricane in recorded history turned back into the Atlantic Ocean tonight, sparing the New England coast. At least eleven people have died in the hurricane's path, and property losses amount to 500 million yuan. Among the eleven fatalities, seven were crew members of the steamship "Long Island." It is reported that 32 other crew members are also missing after the ship encountered the storm. However, it was learned this morning that they survived after reaching the coast in a small lifeboat. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(New York) The entire Atlantic coast was hit by a violent hurricane yesterday, which continued into the night, causing significant loss of life and property.

All signal stations in the southern states have lowered storm warning signals, as the Weather Bureau reports that the hurricane has moved northeast. The shipping losses from this storm are estimated at least 5 million US dollars. Small boats traveling between the coast and in harbors were the hardest hit. There were a total of 41 casualties, and 67 people are still missing. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Renowned British-Australian Air Race Pilot Black Killed in Accident; Collision with Military Aircraft in Fog; Critically Injured and Unable to be Saved</h3>
<p>(London) Renowned British aviator Mr. Black, who won the British-Australian Air Race in 1934 with Mr. Scott, has joined the London to Johannesburg Air Race scheduled for September 29th. Today, while piloting the "Lady Liverpool" at the Liverpool Speke Airport, it was struck by an air force bomber, causing the propeller to hit and critically injure Black in the cockpit. At the time, the fog was dense, and Black's plane was black and white, making it difficult for the bomber pilot to distinguish. This is likely the cause of the accident. Black was rushed to the hospital after being injured, but despite the best efforts of the doctors, he died from his injuries. Black's wife is actress Thea Sistman. She was rehearsing a new play in a London theater when she received the news of her husband's death. In 1934, Black and Scott flew a plane together from Mildenhall, England, to Melbourne, Australia, in 2 days, 22 hours, and 58 minutes, a distance of 11,323 miles. As a result, they won the £10,000 prize from Australian millionaire Sir Robertson, and became famous in the aviation world. Black was initially in love with Ms. Sistman, and after arriving in Melbourne and completing his great achievement, he telegraphed her to propose. She telegraphed back her acceptance, and they became a couple. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Prominent Figure in Tsarist Russian Literature, Tang Qian'ge, Dies in Prague</h3>
<p>Prague, Czech Republic: Tang Qian'ge, a famous writer of the Tsarist Russian era, recently died here at the age of 92. Tang Qian'ge was born in 1844 in Tallinn, Russian Empire. In his early years, he gained fame in the literary world by publishing works about the Arctic Ocean. During the Russo-Turkish War in 1877, Tang Qian'ge accompanied the Russian commander General Skobelev on the expedition, personally went to the front lines, and described the realities of the war. He also participated in the battle of the Shipka Pass, making him known throughout Russia. He later served as a war correspondent for various newspapers for 50 years. Tang Qian'ge personally participated in every major war in Europe. Although he was old, he regretted not being able to personally witness the recent war between Italy and Abyssinia. Tang Qian'ge was also a famous novelist, and together with Nekrasov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Gorky, he was one of the most famous writers of the era of Tsar Alexander II, advocating liberalism and opposing autocratic politics. Gorky passed away not long ago, and now Tang Qian'ge has also passed away, leaving the veteran figure in Northern Tsarist Russian literature completely gone. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Possibility of Anglo-Japanese Amity</h3>
<p>—Ji Nan</p>
<p>In recent months, the call for Anglo-Japanese amity has grown louder. In early September, Tokyo even rumored that British Foreign Secretary Hoare had drafted an Anglo-Japanese compromise plan: (1) Britain recognizes "Manchukuo" and Japan's special status in North China; (2) Japan respects China's territorial integrity, maintains the Open Door policy, and British vested interests in China. Although this news was denied by London authorities, judging from the recent large-scale activities of Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida Shigeru in London and the remarks of Londoners, Anglo-Japanese amity, although not yet ripe, seems to be an undeniable fact that both sides are interested in adjusting bilateral relations. The recent visit to Japan by the new British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, en route to his post, to meet with Japanese diplomatic authorities and discuss Anglo-Japanese issues and Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues, is further proof of this. If we observe the past relationship between the two countries and the current international situation, it is not difficult to see what the possibility of Anglo-Japanese amity is.</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, Britain and Japan were allied countries. At that time, Japan's power was not yet fully developed. It was trying to expand outward but lacked support. Britain's Far Eastern forces were being threatened by old Russia. Although it wanted to resist, it was unwilling to sacrifice itself. Therefore, they used each other and formed an alliance to defeat their common enemy. However, after old Russia was defeated, Japan rose up in its place. It expanded vast territories politically, increased its military strength, and made great progress in industry. Thus, the foundation of capitalism was established. After the European War, Japan achieved even more amazing achievements in industry and commerce, inflicting a great blow on Britain's economic power in the Far East. In Australia, India, Canada, China, Southeast Asia, and other places, Britain and Japan were in a position of direct conflict in commerce. For twenty years, there have been open and secret struggles, without ceasing, and the so-called Anglo-Japanese alliance is only a historical relic. After the September 18th Incident, Japan exclusively occupied the Northeast Provinces. Last year, it further coveted Hebei and Chahar, creating its special status in North China. Thus, Britain's economic power in China was further suppressed. The so-called special trade of smuggling penetrated everywhere, and Japan's economic war against Britain in South China and the Yangtze River basin was even more pressing, causing Britain to feel that its power in China was not only greatly threatened, but also in danger of fundamental upheaval. Under these circumstances, if it wants to take a tough stance against Japan to maintain its inherent position in China, the European continent is restless due to the rising arrogance of Fascist countries, and it has no time to take care of the Far Eastern issue. In this distress, Britain has been trying to break this stalemate for a year.</p>
<p>So what is the way to break this stalemate? It is either to compromise with Japan or to join hands with the Soviet Union. In September last year, British economic envoy Sir Frederick Leith-Ross came to China to investigate the economic situation and help us reform the currency system. At the same time, he also had full hopes for the adjustment of Anglo-Japanese relations. However, at that time, Japan's desire to exclusively occupy China was rising day by day, so Ross spent half a month in China, visited Japan twice, and was subjected to cold ridicule by the Japanese government and public. He had to return in vain, and there was no improvement in Anglo-Japanese relations. However, if something is lost in the east, it may be recovered in the west. Anglo-Soviet cooperation can also be a great threat to Japan. Compared with the situation at the time of the Russo-Japanese War, the positions of Japan and Russia have obviously been reversed. Today, Britain's alliance with Russia to contain Japan can also be said to be inevitable. Therefore, although there has been a permanent barrier between Britain and the Soviet Union for years due to the absolute incompatibility of national systems, and Britain has even led the world's anti-Soviet front, due to the gradually deepening contradiction between Britain and Japan, the increasingly acute conflict, and the slim hope of compromise, it had to change its course and urgently seek improvement. As a result, the Anglo-Soviet loan agreement and the Anglo-Soviet naval agreement, which had been brewing for several months, suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse at the end of July and were declared established under Britain's great step. The former is a harbinger of Anglo-Soviet economic understanding and cooperation, and the latter recognizes the Soviet Union's reserved conditions for the Far East, giving the Soviet Union the right to freely respond in the Far East. The subtext is nothing more than to explain that Britain is about to support the Soviet Union to confront Japan.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Soviet cooperation having been initiated, people in Tokyo deeply felt that Britain's gradual hardening towards Japan would make Japan's diplomatic isolation even worse. Foreign Minister Arita's repeated statements revealed anxiety, so Japanese public opinion loudly advocated Anglo-Japanese amity, and Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru was active in London. However, the emergence of this kind of pro-British atmosphere in Japan, which was not seen during Ross's repeated visits to Japan, is not only due to the Anglo-Soviet cooperation and hardening towards Japan, but also due to the recent trend of China towards real unification and the gradual progress of political and economic construction. This is also an important factor. Today, China's real unification has been completed, so Japan's attitude towards China should be clearly established as soon as possible. Since it is impossible to monopolize East Asia, the urgent need to adjust bilateral relations is almost inevitable. Many insightful people in Japan have already paid attention to this, so there is a call to re-establish a policy towards China. After Ambassador Kawagoe arrived in China, he strongly advocated Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Foreign Minister Arita also admitted that it is necessary to emphasize "economic diplomacy." Japan's policy toward China is shifting from the military to the diplomatic, and from the political to the economic. If this is clear, then Japan's conflict of interest with Britain in China, due to the development of this new situation, must strive to seek a reasonable solution at this time.</p>
<p>But what is Britain's attitude? Will it always pursue a consistent policy of joining hands with the Soviet Union to contain Japan? That is not the case. After all, diplomatic skills are multifaceted, and British diplomacy is known for its flexibility and adaptability to the environment. Moreover, Britain only wants to maintain its inherent economic power in China and not be threatened. On August 8th, the new British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, firmly stated in Tokyo in response to a question from a Central News Agency reporter: "Britain's greatest interest in China is to maintain peace and trade. Therefore, Britain will consider anything that causes disturbance and unrest in any part of China to hinder Britain's interest." If Japan can give considerable satisfaction in this regard, there is no reason why the relations between the two countries cannot be temporarily compromised. In other words, the focus of the problem is whether Japan can make concessions in its economic war against Britain. However, Japan's amazing progress in industry in recent years has forced it to find overseas markets to dump its surplus goods. The increasingly fierce trade wars between Japan and India are also unavoidable. Whether Japan can make concessions to Britain is actually still a matter of doubt. In summary, the possibility of Anglo-Japanese amity depends on how much Japan can guarantee Britain's economic power in the Far East, that is, how many economic concessions Japan will make to Britain.</p>

<h3>Realization of Peace in Guangxi; Li Zongren Flies to Guangzhou to Meet Chiang; Bai Chongxi Stays in Guangxi to Handle Troop Demobilization; Martial Law Begins to be Lifted in Wuzhou; Guangxi Currency Appreciates</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The mediation of the Guangxi situation, after half a month of negotiations between the two sides, was specifically resolved in the middle of this month. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi took office as Pacification Commissioners and members of the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission on the 16th in the Guangxi Provincial Party Headquarters. Cheng Qian and Huang Shaohong were sent by the central government to administer the oath. After Li and Bai took office, Bai Chongxi was unable to come to Guangzhou to meet with Chairman Chiang for a while due to the need to handle the demobilization of the Guangxi army and the retirement of the militia in Guangxi. Therefore, Li Zongren first went to pay his respects to Chiang and ask for instructions on the future pacification of Guangxi Province. Li Zongren then flew east from Yongning on the 17th with Guangxi Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu, Guangxi Army Staff Officer Liu Weizhang, and Military Commission Staff Officer Lei Biao, and Cheng Qian and Huang Shaohong, who came to Yongning to welcome them, in a giant aircraft. At about 3 pm, the aircraft landed safely at Tianhe Airport. At that time, those who welcomed them at the scene included Ju Zheng, Qian Dajun, Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, Xu Jingting, Xiang Hanping, and senior party and government officials of Guangdong Province. After Li Zongren, Cheng, Huang, Liu, Lei, and others got off the plane, Li shook hands with each of the welcomers as a courtesy. Li was wearing a gray cloth military uniform that day and was in very good spirits. After leaving the airport, he went to the banquet of Yu Hanmou and Huang Musong, which did not end until about 5 pm. Li Zongren returned to his residence at the Jiyuan residence in Dongshan that night to rest and received his subordinates in Guangdong. The next day (the 18th) at about 9 am, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Qian Dajun, drove from Huangpu to Li's residence in Dongshan to visit Li. Li, having received prior notice, immediately went down the stairs to greet him with Cheng Qian, Huang Xuchu, Huang Shaohong, and others. After Chiang and Li met, they went into the hall and talked for 30 minutes before Chiang left and went to the Huangpu Military Academy to discuss party and state affairs. After breakfast, Li Zongren accompanied Liu Weizhang, Cheng Qian, Huang Xuchu, Huang Shaohong, and their entourage in four cars along Zhongshan Road to Yuzhuwei in Panyu, crossed the river to the Huangpu Military Academy, and paid his respects to Chairman Chiang. They discussed the overall situation and the party, military, and political issues of Guangxi Province in detail. At about 2 pm, Li returned to his residence by car to rest for a while, and at 3 pm, he drove to pay a return visit to the Guangdong military and political officials Yu Hanmou and Huang Musong. It is heard that Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu will stay in Guangdong for a few days. After asking for instructions on the post-war affairs of Guangxi Province, they will return to Guangxi. The Guangxi Pacification Office is organized in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the central government. Regarding the number of Guangxi troops reorganized, Weng Zhaoyuan's division will be incorporated into the Guangxi army, but the designation will be changed to the Fifth Route Army. The military expenses will be 2.5 million to 3 million yuan per month, half of which will be assisted by the central government. It is planned to change the new name on October 1st. Li Zongren will serve as the commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army, and Li Pinxian will serve as the chief of staff. This order can be issued during the day. The Fifth Column of the Guangxi Army, Weng Zhaoyuan's troops, stationed in Beihai will withdraw from Beihai in a few days and return to Yulin on the Guangxi border to await orders. Cai Tingkai has already left Yongning and went to Yulin on the 16th to inspect his old troops and prepare for the reorganization. Wuzhou began to lift martial law from the 17th, and the troops are also preparing to demobilize. The civilian ships that were requisitioned a few days ago have been given funds to return. The mines on the Fu River and the Dajiang River are also being recovered one after another, and water and land transportation will be restored. The value of Guangxi banknotes has rebounded. Previously, 100 Hong Kong dollars could buy 200 Guangxi dollars. After the 16th, 100 Hong Kong dollars were only worth 168 Guangxi dollars. After the realization of peace, it will not be difficult for Guangxi banknotes to return to their original value. (September 19th)</p>
<h3>Li Qingxuan Negotiates New Tax Measures with the Hebei-Chahar Authorities; Inspection Office Still Secretly Clearing Smuggled Goods; Recent Shipments of Smuggled Goods to Pingbao Increased Sharply</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Li Qingxuan, a counselor of the Ministry of Finance, accompanied by Advisor Qi and two Western tax officials from the Shanghai General Customs Office, arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 16th. At noon, they attended a banquet hosted by Sun Weidong, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, and met with Guo Zhihan, the director of the Finance Department of the Hebei-Chahar Council, Wang Hongen, the director of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office, and Xu Liya, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner. They exchanged detailed opinions on anti-smuggling and the collection of inspection fees in Hebei and Chahar. Li explained the Ministry of Finance's views on these two matters, and the discussions were lengthy. On the morning of the 17th, Li and Sun visited Song at No. 113, 17th Road, British Concession, conveying the financial aspirations for the new Hebei-Chahar tax. Song made sincere expressions. In the afternoon, Li visited Zhang Zizhong, the mayor of Tianjin, and Wang Hongen, the director of the Hebei-Chahar General Office, successively, seeking information. That evening, Qin Dechun and Ge Dingyuan were summoned to Tianjin by Song. Together with Guo Zhihan, Wang Hongen, and others, they went to Bei Ning's residence on Haihe Road, inviting Li Qingxuan to continue discussions. After reaching a result, Li telegraphed the Finance Ministry, awaiting a reply. Upon receiving the reply, it will be conveyed to Song for a final decision. Li himself will go to Ping to investigate after completing his tasks in Tianjin. Regarding the negotiations in the North, Li issued a written statement on the 18th, stating that he was ordered to come north with customs tax officials because Chairman Song and others discussed the situation in the Tianjin market last month and instructed him to report back to Minister Kong. After review by the relevant departments, they are now bringing it to Chairman Song for further consultation. Yesterday, they met with Chairman Song and reported on the progress. Regarding the original proposed plan, they were instructed to further study it with all relevant personnel to find a suitable way to maintain the legitimate interests of Chinese and foreign merchants, resolve the current difficulties, and allow the North China economy to move towards activity. The motive for this trip north is not solely about the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office. The Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office was reorganized from the Gun and Salt Coastal Defense Inspection Office. This office has been established for a long time, originally to investigate bandits, drugs, and munitions, and to assist in anti-smuggling, not to collect consumption taxes on smuggled goods. Recent foreign reports that the office has announced regulations to collect one-eighth of customs duties and release smuggled goods are mostly misunderstandings and speculation. Now that the truth is clear, this issue no longer needs to be studied. Regarding the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office, since its establishment on the 8th of this month, due to excessive opposition from foreign parties and repeated inquiries from Shanghai groups, those in charge have become timid and dare not publicly announce tax rates. However, actual work has already begun. The Pingbao Qikou sub-offices were established last week. Only the Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and Cangxian sub-offices are still being organized. Wang Hongen, the director-general, is the strongest advocate for active implementation. He is horrified by the accusations from various parties and has secretly inspected and released all staff, using smugglers and merchants as guarantors to register the amount of goods for future total fees. On the 16th, one release of smuggled goods included 13,000 bags of sugar and 300 boxes of rayon. At a certain concession, there are 8,000 bags of sugar and 1,300 boxes of rayon being inspected and awaiting shipment. Other items such as seafood, foreign wine, kerosene, and textiles are also awaiting shipment in large quantities. Although the amount of fees was set in advance, it has changed due to the high level of opposition. It is now proposed to divide them into four grades: Heaven, Earth, Xuan, and Huang, and levy them at different rates of 60%, 45%, 35%, and 25% of the regular customs duty. However, smugglers disagree with the increase because the office promised in advance to collect only one-eighth of the customs duty. The person in charge is finding it difficult. The Tianjin Customs and the office are targeting the three card stations in the suburbs of Tianjin, which have been set up in Baimiao Xiaoxiyingmen and Shengfang Wharf. However, in recent days, they have intercepted large quantities of smuggled goods. Smugglers have produced the "Hebei-Chahar Cangyan Ports Coastal Defense Inspection Office" inspection certificates as proof of payment of regular taxes, and they are not subject to inspection or detention, and they rush through the checkpoints. Every day, dozens of trucks transport these goods and forcibly pass through the checkpoints. Smuggled goods without inspection certificates, with military flags inserted on the trucks, also pass through the checkpoints, transporting them to Pingbao and southern Hebei. Because the customs needs the assistance of the Hebei-Chahar military and police agencies, they are taking advantage of Li Qingxuan's presence in Tianjin to ask him to negotiate on their behalf to ensure strict interception.

<h3>Kunshan: Bandits Attempt to Rob, Arrested</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau recently received a secret report that a group of bandits would come to Kunshan to plot something illegal. Detective Li of the Detective Team led the entire team of detectives and police to the station at about 7:00 AM on the 18th. They saw a group of people resembling workers, accompanied by a woman, getting off the train. Li and others followed closely behind, all the way to the vicinity of the Xiaoximen Confucian Temple, before issuing an order to arrest the five men and women involved. They were taken to the bureau, and a Browning pistol and twenty rounds of ammunition were found. After interrogation, they confessed their names as Wang A..., Wu Guangyou, Zhu Weiqing, Zhou Zhengrong, and the female bandit Gu Zhangshi. They admitted that they came to Kunshan with the intention of robbing the family of a certain surname in the Leek Field in the city. The five bandits, along with the guns and ammunition, were transferred to the judiciary for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Five Notorious Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>Song Taowei, captain of the water patrol team of the Public Security Bureau of this county, recently received a secret report from informants stating that Tao Jinshan (the younger brother of Tao Yalin, the ringleader of the Chen Xiangchun family case in Xiaozhangjiaqiao, which was solved during the tenure of the former detective team leader Zhong Jihe), and several other escaped robbers who had robbed Longzhu Nunnery in Zhoujing Township, were hiding in the countryside near Hushuguan in Suzhou. After receiving the report, Captain Song, accompanied by patrol officer Wang Hengru, traveled by car to Hushuguan the day before yesterday and submitted a letter to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Yang County, requesting assistance in the arrest. Director Xu of the branch dispatched patrol officer Hu and several police officers to go with Captain Song to search the areas of Baitishan and Beiyangyangbang. They successfully arrested the bandits Tao Jinshan and the female bandit Tao Zhu. They also captured a bandit in his thirties in the Tang Fuquan teahouse on North Gate Street of Hushuguan. In a straw shed across the river from the Wenchang Pavilion, they captured the robber Xu Furong. Two rifles, one Browning pistol, one bayonet, and one 1,000-foot flashlight were found in the home of Yao Gantou Zhu Tianshou. Zhu himself escaped, and only his mother was captured. In addition, they also seized men's and women's leather clothing, iron bars, and other stolen goods and weapons. Another pistol was carried by the bandit leader Tao Atan when he escaped. The captured male and female bandits were escorted to Wuxi yesterday (20th) and sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the local court for trial.</p>

Those who failed to comply would be ordered to close. Now that the deadline has passed for half a month, eight bathhouses, including Xinquan, Second Spring, Central Bathhouse, Xiyuan, Daguan Garden, Zhenjiang Bathhouse, Daxingchi, and Runquan, have not yet complied. After receiving the report, the county government believed that the bathhouses were intentionally delaying and should be strictly enforced as a warning. They were ordered to close in accordance with the case and have sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital to assist in the execution yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Establishment of the National Economic Branch</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement, it ordered all counties to establish branches and work hard to promote agricultural reclamation, afforestation, water conservancy, industry, commerce, planned economy and other matters. Magistrate Ma of this county was ordered to prepare for the organization, and has now hired party, government, business, academic, local and technical personnel to serve as committee members and commissioners. It is heard that the first meeting will be held in the county government on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Floating Corpse Found at Baota Bridge</h3>
<p>A male corpse, about twenty years old, was found floating at Baota Bridge on the South Dou Outer Canal on the 19th. He was wearing a Serge jacket, white trousers, straight Gongne shoes, and yellow socks. Xu Bao Township Xiangding discovered the corpse and reported it to the Floating Corpse Burial Association. People were sent to salvage the body ashore, and then the procuratorate was notified to send someone to inspect it. A coffin was prepared for burial.</p>
<h3>Taizhou: Security Team Cracks Ransom Case</h3>
<p>Wang Hua, the head of the Aohuan self-funded security team in Wenling County, learned at 3:00 AM on the 16th that Zhang Bao's house in Zhaimen was hiding a kidnapped person. He immediately led soldiers to the house. A bandit was discovered and ordered to guard the doorway. Wang entered the house and encountered a bandit upstairs. The two sides exchanged gunfire. As a result, the bandit Zheng Xuebin was killed, and the bandit Zheng Hualiang was injured. The kidnapped person, Wang Mingrui, a resident of Qinggang, 54 years old, was found. He was led by the local Zhu Xisu Bao and, at 2:00 PM, sent the injured bandit, the bandit's wife, Zhang Zhengshi, and two pistols to the county government for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Carelessness at Yuansheng Warehouse in Yangxiang Lane</h3>
<p>The Yuansheng goods warehouse behind Yangxiang Lane in this city suddenly caught fire at about 2:30 AM this morning (19th). The warehouse staff heard the noise and got up to see that the fire had spread through the roof. Yilong from various districts rushed to the scene to rescue, but because it was too far from the river wharf and the location was narrow, it was difficult to rescue. The fire was extinguished after burning for an hour. As a result, Xintai Salted Goods Warehouse and the Salt Industry Association were affected. All the salted fish, cured meat, and means of making a living were burned to ashes, and more than 20 houses were burned, for a total loss of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tongshan: Robbery at the School Military Field</h3>
<p>The school military field in the west of Tongyi is a place where miscellaneous people gather in the west of the city. There are many cattle and donkey merchants. Yuan Chengen, the owner of the Sishun public cattle firm, lives in Chengjia Lane nearby. Because of the developed transaction, he has a little savings. He also handles the storage of cash for buying and selling cattle and donkeys on behalf of customers. At 9:00 PM on the 17th, Yuan was still at the store and had not returned home. His wife, Zhang, was breastfeeding in the room when four bandits, each wearing blue clothes, two holding box guns and one holding a flashlight, broke in through the front door. One person was left on guard at the door, and the other three rushed into the room, extinguished the lights, and used a flashlight to search, scaring Zhang into silence. They searched the room and robbed 460 silver dollars before escaping. When Yuan heard the news, he reported it to the military police to pursue the bandits, but they were nowhere to be found. The Public Security Bureau is currently investigating and arresting the murderers.</p>
<h3>Recent Overview of Guangdong and Guangxi (1)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Xiao An</p>
<p>After the renewal of the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, the people's wealth, the party, and the military were returned to the central government. All the organizations in the southwest in the past few years have completely ended. In the future, the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi urgently need the construction of a new administration, and the people of the two provinces are also very eager to recuperate. Therefore, the current situation of the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi is of concern to the people of the country. The reporter has a trip to Guangdong and Guangxi, and now records the things I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Guangzhou</p>
<p>People traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong have always relied on postal ships for express journeys, which can be reached in two days and one night. In the past few years, the business situation of various postal ships between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the American Dollar Steamship Company and the British China Navigation Company are the best, followed by the postal ship companies of France, Germany, and Italy, and the Japanese NYK Line is the worst. The reason for this is that the NYK Line business has been greatly affected since the 918 Incident. It is found that the NYK Line's three ships, the Tatsuta Maru, Asama Maru, and Chichibu Maru, are newly constructed and have a load of more than 20,000 tons. The passenger tickets are cheaper than the Dollar and China Navigation companies. Taking the third-class cabin as an example, the Dollar and China Navigation companies are US$15, while the Japanese company is US$10. However, the business performance of the NYK Line is not good. This can be considered more than half. It is heard that in recent years, the NYK Line company has relied on the subsidies issued by its government for survival due to poor business. However, since August 10, the NYK Line passenger ticket has been reduced from US$10 to US$8, intending to attract business by devaluing the price, in order to improve passengers and cargo and reduce the responsibility of its government for relief. However, the Dollar and China Navigation companies, seeing the NYK Line cut prices, also reduced the third-class passenger ticket from US$15 to US$12 from this month to compete with the NYK Line. This shows the situation of Japanese commercial environment.</p>
<p>The reporter took a boat south from Shanghai. On the boat, I saw a few poor old overseas Chinese, and many students returning from Tokyo wearing kimonos all day long. There is nothing else to record. My roommate was Mr. Zhang of Sun Yat-sen University and Mr. Fu, the staff officer of the command. In the two days and nights, we talked in the small room and felt very happy. Mr. Fu participated in the defense against Japan at the Great Wall and the suppression of bandits in southern Anhui and made many contributions to the strategy at the time. Even now, when talking about the Battle of the Great Wall, we still cannot help but sigh. Mr. Fu is a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy and is proficient in both literary and military strategies. I am very impressed with him. The boat arrived in Hong Kong and docked at the Kowloon pier. The place is close to the Canton-Kowloon Railway, Tsim Sha Tsui Station. The reporter and Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhang took the train to Guangzhou and no longer stayed in Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong dock workers and the so-called "miscellaneous differences" (the other name of detective) often openly use extortion and other unethical behaviors against the luggage of people going back and forth. The luggage of the reporter and Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhang were merged into one place, and the quantity was slightly more, so they were also blackmailed by them. This kind of fact is a stain on the British civilized politics. The British government should quickly eliminate it.</p>
<p>The Canton-Kowloon Railway express train runs three times a day in both directions. The ones departing from Guangzhou are the Flying Eagle Express at 8:15 AM, the Midday Express at 1:10 PM, and the Flying Dragon Express at 4:50 PM. The ones departing from Hong Kong are the Flying Arrow Express at 8:30 AM, the Midday Express at 12:45 PM, and the Flying Star Express at 5:05 PM. The full fare from Guangzhou to Hong Kong is 1.4 yuan for the third class in Guangdong legal tender, and from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, it is one yuan for the third class in Hong Kong paper money. The exchange rate between the Guangdong currency and the Hong Kong currency is 10 to 14. The other second-class and first-class passenger tickets are calculated in multiples. The reporter took the Flying Star Express to Guangzhou in the afternoon. The Canton-Kowloon Railway, from Hong Kong to Shenzhen, is the British section, and from Shenzhen to Guangzhou is the Chinese section. Along the British section, the British have built many highways. Although the villages are all Chinese style, the layout is very Westernized. The people of Hong Kong call it the "New Territories," which means that the Hong Kong government has newly occupied it. Shenzhen is a Chinese-British border area, and the management of local military and police is relatively loose. The place has become a den of dirt and filth. The three poisons of opium, gambling, and prostitution are all gathered there. The inland bandits also regard the place as a refuge for fugitives. When opium and gambling were not banned, the most famous gambling den was the "Yousheng Company," which was a branch of the Guangzhou Yude Gambling Company. The capital reached more than one million yuan. All kinds of gambling, such as Fan-Tan, Pai Gow, roulette, and dice, are available. The company also built theaters and opium dens to lure gamblers. The harm it leaves to the people is painful. When the train stopped at Shenzhen Station, I looked at the buildings of gambling dens, theaters, and hotels from a distance. The green tiles and pink walls, and the street lights from the station to the gambling dens, theaters, and hotels, all imitate the Forbidden City style, but they are very vulgar. Proceeding beyond Shenzhen, the villages are very dense, but each village must have several watchtowers, standing in the front, back, left, right, or center of the village. The momentum is quite majestic. It is allowed that the Pinghu, Zhangmutou, and Shilong stations are located nearby. Shilong is one of the major towns in Guangdong Province, and also an important road for entering and leaving the East River. The people of the East River have always been known as the strongest in Guangdong. From the walls, you can imagine. At about 8 o'clock, the car arrived at Dashatou Station in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Canton-Kowloon Railway Bureau has been vigorously promoting the development of railway affairs in recent years, but the order in the third-class carriages is deeply regretted and has not been improved. The most annoying thing is the hawkers selling food. Some people hold only three or four packages of Yunpian cakes and come and go to sell them more than 20 times. The same is true for those who sell longan, pears, and soda. The inside of the car is very noisy. As for the price, it is even more expensive. Soda sells for 1.4 Hong Kong dollars per bottle, which is equivalent to 20 cents in Chinese currency. Moreover, the clothes of those who sell food are not clean, and the leftovers such as water, vegetables, peels, and shells are discarded in front of the passengers, which is enough to give people a bad impression. The passenger ticket is checked once after the train departs, once again after passing Shenzhen, and then collected by the ticket inspector after passing Shilong. Therefore, when the car arrives at Dashatou Station in Guangzhou, passengers disembark one after another. There is no procedure for collecting tickets at the station. At this time, there are many people gathering on the platform to watch the fun. Chauffeurs and workers carrying luggage also enter the platform directly. This is different from the organization of the Jinghu Railway Station. (Sent from Guangzhou on September 16)</p>

<p>Shanghai Educational Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram was sent to comfort Chairman Chiang (title omitted). Since the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi held different views on national salvation, rumors arose and the people were disturbed. Recently, the situation in Guangdong has been stabilized, and the power of Guangxi has suddenly increased. The whole country was worried that war was inevitable and that the country would perish imminently. Our Chairman insisted on tolerance from beginning to end, and gave heartfelt advice. The comrades in Guangxi were sincerely touched and released their weapons with laughter and instantly communicated their plans. Unification has been completed, and peace has been realized. It is known that small tolerance can achieve great plans, and sincerity has never failed to move people. Our association, hearing the good news from afar, is immensely pleased and sincerely sends congratulations on behalf of the educational community in Shanghai. Looking south across the sea, we are endlessly attached. We respectfully offer our sincerity, and hope to be considered. Shanghai Educational Association, code,</p>
<h3>Zhang Gongquan, Yu Feipeng, and Wei Lihuang Arrived in Shanghai on the Same Ship from Hong Kong Yesterday; Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, and Others Went to the Port to Welcome Them; Zhang and Yu Will Return to Nanjing in a Few Days, While Wei Will Transfer Back to Hubei</h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, who went south to inspect railway administration some time ago, Yu Feipeng, Acting Minister of Communications, who inspected communications, and Wei Lihuang, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route Army, who went to Guangdong from Hubei to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, returned north together on the Canadian Empress of the China Navigation Company after completing their missions. They arrived in Shanghai at about 2:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Gonghexing Wharf on Broadway Road. Those who went to welcome them included Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Li Dachao, the representative of Mayor Wu, Chu Minyi, member of the Central Committee, Peng Xuepei, Vice Minister of Communications, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two-Roads Administration Bureau, Cai Zengji, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Tan Boying, Deputy General Manager, Li Jingcong, Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Dai Enji, Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Zhu Changnian, Acting Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, Pan Guangjiong, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Railways, Wu Yu, Director of the Municipal Maritime Affairs Bureau, Bao Keyong, Director of the Telegraph Bureau, and Wang Zhinan, Secretary of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and more than 40 others. Zhang and Yu will return to Nanjing in a day or two to preside over their respective ministries, and Wei will also go to Nanjing in the next few days and transfer back to Hubei. The talks of Zhang, Yu, and Wei will be recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>Zhang Gongquan's Talk</p>
<p>According to Zhang Gongquan, his trip south was to inspect the Yuehan Railway administration. The issue of connecting the Yuehan and Canton-Kowloon railways was not discussed. The Yuehan Railway will be officially opened to traffic as soon as military transport is completed. The road will be extended to Huangpu in the future. The estimated cost is 10 million yuan, with the Ministry of Railways and the Guangdong Provincial Government each responsible for 5 million yuan. The rumor that the Ministry of Railways borrowed 3 million yuan from the Shanghai banking community to complete the Yuehan Railway is not accurate.</p>
<p>Yu Feipeng's Talk</p>
<p>According to Yu Feipeng, the communications industry in Guangdong Province, including management, administration, and other aspects, has not been reorganized for more than ten years. On this trip, he inspected all subordinate agencies and drafted a comprehensive reorganization plan to be implemented in order to seek improvement. He also plans to start with the telecommunications administration. Regarding the Shanghai-Guangdong wireless telephone communication, a radio station will be built and actively prepared, and it is expected to be realized within the year.</p>

<p>Yu Feipeng (International Press Photo)</p>
<p>Wei Lihuang's Talk</p>
<p>According to Wei Lihuang, his decision to go south was to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. The current situation in Guangdong and Guangxi is very good. Bai Chongxi is currently in charge of repatriation matters. As soon as it is completed, he will go to Guangdong to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and will go to Nanjing with Chairman Chiang to take office.</p>
<p>Regarding his intention to go abroad, according to his knowledge, Chairman Chiang persuaded him to stay and cancelled the plan. The banditry in Hubei and Anhui provinces has been cleared. Only Henan Province still has a small number of bandits, about several hundred, which can be cleared soon, which is not a problem. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then go to Nanjing and transfer back to Hubei.</p>
<h3>Good Harvest Year, Cotton Cloth Sells Well, Inventory Sold Out, Production Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>In recent years, the domestic cotton cloth industry in Shanghai has suffered from the decline of the rural economy and the dumping of foreign goods, resulting in stagnant production and sales, heavy losses, and a bleak future. According to news from the industry, since the autumn of this year, the sales of domestic cotton cloth have suddenly flourished. Cotton cloth merchants from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces have come to Shanghai to purchase in an endless stream. In the past two months, all the stored cotton cloth in Shanghai has been sold out, and the demand for orders is still strong. Various Chinese textile factories are busy processing and weaving to meet the market demand. This is a phenomenon that the cotton cloth industry has only seen in the past two or three years. The reason for the sudden increase in sales is that this year's cotton, wheat, and silk crops have been plentiful, and the exhausted rural economy has been slightly revived. Therefore, the best-selling cotton cloth is also domestic coarse cloth suitable for rural use.</p>
<h3>Public Debt and Savings Deposit Interest Income Tax to be Levied from October 1st; Notice from the Banking Association for Member Banks to Take Note</h3>

A copy of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations is enclosed for the Ministry to</p>
<p>comply with</p>
<p>and to instruct its subordinates to take note accordingly. This order, etc. A copy of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations has been received by the Ministry.

Please also instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly, etc. An enclosed copy of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations is forwarded to the Association."

<h3>National Association of Inspection for Smuggling Requests Ministry of Finance to Facilitate Inventory Sales; Coordinating with Chambers of Commerce to Issue Certificates</h3>
<p>The National Association of Inspection for Smuggling yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance regarding the issuance of inventory certificates by inland chambers of commerce, stating, "Submitting a report with a request for review and instructions. This association has received a report from the Smuggling Inspection Committee of the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce, stating, 'This association has received letters from various trade associations in the city, stating that goods purchased before the implementation of the Transportation and Sales Regulations have all been registered. However, these goods cannot be issued transportation and sales licenses, resulting in obstacles when transported to other locations. Moreover, as autumn approaches, the sales market is gradually becoming active. Without relief measures to facilitate transportation and sales, legitimate business operations will inevitably come to a standstill, and merchants will suffer losses that are unbearable. We sincerely request that measures be taken to provide relief and facilitate transportation, etc.' While the matter was under review, this association received another letter from the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce, stating that it had received a communication from the Hubei Provincial Government forwarding the Ministry of Finance's Consultation No. 28659, Series Customs, dated July 31, 1936, stating that 'It is permissible that many goods seized by various provinces were purchased before the implementation of the Transportation and Sales Regulations and should not be punished. Various parties have repeatedly telegraphed to request a response from the Ministry. It is now stipulated that "goods purchased by inland businesses before the implementation of the Transportation and Sales Regulations should not be subject to the provisions of the Transportation and Sales Regulations. However, if a large quantity of goods is suspected of being smuggled by Customs, Customs may investigate and handle the matter in accordance with the Anti-Smuggling Regulations," etc., requesting that this association take note and forward the information. The transportation of inventory from various businesses in this city to inland areas is indeed difficult. If no relief measures are provided, the impact will be significant. Based on this regulation, this association drafted a sample inventory certificate, submitted it to the Fourth Standing Committee Meeting of this association for deliberation and approval, and is still awaiting submission to the National Association of Inspection for Smuggling, requesting that the Ministry of Finance approve its implementation, etc.' A record of the proceedings is attached. We hereby attach a sample inventory certificate and submit it to your Association for review, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation in order to provide relief and facilitate transportation, which would be in the public interest, etc., to the Association. This Association believes that the difficulty in transportation, as stated, is indeed the case. We hereby attach a sample inventory certificate drafted by the Association and submit it for review, requesting that its implementation be approved to facilitate the transportation of goods, which would be in the public interest."</p>

<h3>Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Association, Yan Baohang, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Returned to Nanjing that evening to preside over the Thrift Movement. Yan Baohang, Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Association, went to Guangdong to guide the establishment of a New Life Movement Promotion Association. After a month-long stay, the work has been completed. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM on the Empress of Canada. As the Thrift Movement begins on the 21st, Yan returned to Nanjing on the night express. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Yan at his residence, and Yan made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Progress in Guangdong</p>
<p>Yan stated that the New Life Movement Promotion Associations of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City were both established on the 21st of last month, with Chairman Huang Musong and Mayor Zeng Huofu serving as directors. The General Association also appointed Huang Musong, Yu Hanmou, and Zeng Yangfu as advisors. The Guangdong New Life Movement Promotion Association is progressing smoothly and achieving good results under the personal guidance of President Chiang and Director Qian (Dajun). All sectors of the local party, government, and military are supporting and actively participating. The initial progress is focused on various agencies, and cleanliness and order have been improved.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling</p>
<p>The people of Guangdong are enterprising, but their past lifestyle was extremely irregular. Therefore, they strongly support the New Life Movement's initiatives and are determined to improve and govern themselves with a renewed spirit. The construction of a new order and the cleanliness of the city are already underway. Guangdong Province has completely banned gambling since September 1st. As for the opium ban measures, the authorities have not yet announced them. It is planned to adopt a gradual approach. The General Association has sent two staff members to Guangdong to assist with the work.</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Hankou Railway Foundation; Request to Maintain Credit</h3>

<h3>National Assembly Venue to be Equipped with Red and Green Lights; What Chu Minyi Said Upon Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Chu Minyi, Deputy Director of the National Assembly Election General Office, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday. He is here to preside over the opening ceremony of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology today and is scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning. Regarding the rumored return of Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, the reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited Chu to inquire about the matter. Chu replied that Wang is still in Czechoslovakia and has no plans to return to China. The various rumors circulating are all untrue. Chu continued to say that there is a new piece of equipment to announce for the National Assembly venue project. Several red and green electric lights will be installed in front of the rostrum, with electric wires connected to each delegate's seat. In the future, when discussing and voting on proposals, there will be no need to raise hands. Delegates can press the electric button at their seats. Green indicates approval, and red indicates opposition. The number of votes for and against will be immediately displayed, and errors can be avoided. The system can also identify who voted in favor and who voted against. Otherwise, counting the hands of thousands of people would be too cumbersome. Furthermore, the stage and music stage are now being expanded to accommodate a hundred or more musicians for ensemble performances. It is planned to invite a Soviet song and dance troupe to China through the China-Soviet Cultural Association, headed by Sun Zhesheng, and they will perform there in the future. Chu also stated that now that the Guangxi issue has been resolved and national unification has been achieved, it is not necessary for Mr. Bai Chongxi to visit Chairman Chiang in Guangdong. It is acceptable for him to meet Chairman Chiang in Nanjing in the future. It is rumored that Bai will form a military inspection delegation to go abroad, which may be true. However, the Central Government hopes that Bai will come to Nanjing as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu Remains in Hospital for Treatment; Plans to Stay for Another Two Months to Cure Chronic Illness</h3>

<h3>Printing Industry Association; Reorganizing Association Affairs; Urging Fellow Businesses to Register</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Printing Industry Association, in order to implement the central government's promulgated measures to sanction businesses that do not join the association, and fearing that businesses may misunderstand the legal principles and cause confusion, issued a letter on the 14th of this month, urging businesses throughout the city to comply with the association's regulations and printed and distributed the aforementioned measures to inform the public. It also placed advertisements on the front pages of the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers on the 16th and 17th of this month, setting a deadline for businesses throughout the city to register with the association by the end of this month. The records department reported yesterday that the number of businesses registering with the association in recent days has been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, dozens of businesses, including Cangjie, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Tiantian, Tiancheng, Junyi, and Liguo, have registered. This shows that businesses throughout the city are able to comply with the recently promulgated measures, and the spirit of unity among businesses is consistent. As the registration deadline is fast approaching, those who have not yet registered should do so immediately to achieve a unified organization, so that the association's affairs and business operations can be developed in accordance with regulations. If businesses still fail to register after the deadline, the association will report to the competent authorities for sanctions in accordance with the law. It is hoped that businesses that have not yet joined the association will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Business Administration Society; Zhu and Zhao Gave Lectures Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Business Administration Society held a lecture meeting yesterday at the cafeteria of the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge. Zhu Xuefan, the Chinese representative to the International Labour Conference who recently returned to China, was specially invited to give a lecture on the labour conditions in Germany and Italy. Zhao Shu of the General Staff Headquarters of the National Government was also invited to speak on the preparations of the business community during extraordinary times. Attendees included Zhao Yunxiang, chairman of the society; Hu Xiyuan, Ji Jiannan, Pan Yangyao, Shi Jiuyun, and Xiang Kangyuan, executive directors; Cheng Shouzhong, director; and members Ren Shigang, Fang Jiange, and more than forty others. Chairman Cao Yunxiang first reported on the society's affairs, followed by Zhu Xuefan's lecture, the main points of which were that the labour enterprises in Germany and Italy were the most successful among European countries. Not only do workers have trade union organizations, but employers also have trade association organizations. Both labor and management consider it their duty to contribute to national production, and there are few unnecessary disputes. Even if there are disputes, they are easily resolved because their people have received considerable education and have undergone group training since childhood. Therefore, social evil forces cannot easily infiltrate, and disputes do not escalate. The method of resolving disputes is first through negotiations between the two parties. If no result is achieved, the government intervenes to mediate. If mediation fails, the labour court makes a ruling, which has the power to compel both parties to obey. As for the normal times, there is considerable contact between labor and management, such as holding social gatherings. Employers are also very concerned about the welfare of labor, so the relationship is very good and disputes rarely occur. Zhao Shu then spoke on the preparations of the business community during extraordinary times. He first stated the inevitability of a second world war, then the precarious situation of China, and finally said that everyone should be prepared. He believed that the business community had a heavy responsibility and needed to be fully prepared. As for how the business community should prepare, Zhao also gave a description, the main points of which were: (1) actively develop industry, especially heavy industry, such as steel, mining, chemicals, power, and electricity; (2) promote scientific research; (3) concentrate organizations; (4) seek economic self-sufficiency; (5) implement thrift; (6) invest in production enterprises related to national defense.</p>
<h3>Public Training Office Orders Municipal Federation; To End Special District Public Training Association; Those Who Have Registered to Join; Training in Nearby Districts</h3>
<p>The Public Training Office yesterday approved the Municipal Federation, stating, "One item submitted, regarding the organizational report of the Public Training Committee and citizen registration documents, requesting review and instructions. All submitted items are noted. The Office notes that the Association's assistance in public training and consolidation of the national foundation is commendable. However, this Office is the only agency in this city responsible for training citizens and must not have organizations of the same name and nature that confuse the public. Moreover, due to rights negotiations, the special district cannot be implemented for the time being. This Office has previously submitted a report to the Municipal Government for review, and it has been instructed to allow citizens of the special district to join the training districts of this Office in the vicinity and receive training together. The Association shall immediately terminate its operations, and those who have registered shall be notified to receive training when the third phase of training begins at this Office. This approval, the 19th day of September, the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936], Director Li Xiangqi; Deputy Director Wang Shaozhai."</p>
<h3>Report from the Disaster Relief Investigators of the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association; Deliberating on the Yellow River Prevention Plan in Western Shandong</h3>
<p>Last summer, the levee breached at Dongzhuang on the Yellow River, causing severe disaster in western Shandong. Although the breach has been repaired recently and the floodwaters have returned to the channel, the land is covered with mud and sand, making it unsuitable for cultivation and resulting in a hopeless harvest. The China Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, located at No. 505 Henan Road in this city, in order to properly plan for the aftermath, specially dispatched Ji Lu, Director of the Shandong Disaster Relief Investigation; Zhang Chun, Chief Engineer; and Tada, Consulting Engineer, to Jixiang, Lutai, Dongping, and Heze to investigate the post-disaster situation and instructed them to formulate a fundamental Yellow River disaster prevention plan for adoption. Mr. Ji and others were dispatched to go forward, which lasted for two weeks, to visit officials and gentry in various places and solicit opinions. They returned to the Association the day before yesterday to report. The report and plan are summarized as follows: "We, Lu and others, previously received the Association's order to investigate the current situation after the disaster in western Shandong and to plan for the fundamental Yellow River disaster prevention. Starting from Linpu, we traveled southeast to Yutai, turned north through Jixiang and Yuncheng, and then northeast to Dongping. Then, along the west bank of the Grand Canal, we crossed Jining and returned. We traveled through ten counties for two weeks. Along the way, the land was barren, the people were emaciated, and the broken walls and ruins were heartbreaking. The severity of the disaster and the hardship of life were evident without investigation. What is lamentable is that the farmers have lost or sold all their livestock and have no way to cultivate the land. Every household or several households work together to pull a plow to replace the oxen. However, the mud and sand brought by the Yellow River have accumulated everywhere, shallow at an inch or so, deep at several feet, with a solid and greasy texture, making it difficult to apply force. Even those who have sown seeds and seedlings are subject to corrosion by black insects and hindered by waterlogging, making it difficult to expect a harvest. The fear of food shortages in the future can be foreseen. As for the fundamental Yellow River disaster prevention methods, as far as we can see, local disaster victims can be mobilized to carry out relief efforts and complete the following two projects: (1) Dredge the Zhao Wang and Wanfu Rivers to allow the Yellow River to be diverted to Nanyang Dushan and other lakes to facilitate drainage; (2) Build a long levee from the Grand Canal along the Songjin River and the upper reaches of the Zhao Wang River to the Henan border and the south bank of the Yellow River, and build a floodgate at the southern end of the levee and several sluice gates at the northern end, each equipped with control mechanisms. When the Yellow River rises sharply, the floodgate will automatically open, and part of the water will be diverted to the Zhao Wang and Wanfu Rivers, etc., to the Nanyang and other lakes. The remaining water will return to the Yellow River through the Songjin River and the western section of the Grand Canal. In this way, the floodwaters will be diverted and the tragic disaster of flooding can be avoided again. Whether the plan for preventing the Yellow River disaster in western Shandong is appropriate is respectfully submitted for consideration and implementation."</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Representatives Petitioning to Return to Shanghai; Reported on the Process Yesterday; Decided to Organize a Unified Export Tea Market; Ministry of Industry Needs to Study This</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Foreign Firms Tea Industry Association of this city, in order to concentrate its strength, develop foreign trade, and restore the reputation of Chinese tea internationally, convened a general meeting of all members this month to discuss the measures. The members unanimously agreed that in order to revitalize the export of tea leaves, it is necessary to unite the industry as a prerequisite. It was decided to organize a "Unified Export Tea Market" (formerly known as the Tea Leaf Joint Sales Office). Members were appointed to draft the articles of association. On the 17th, Ye Shichang, chairman of the association; Sun Zifu, supervisor; and Yu Daxiong and Cao Yunjie, consultants, took the draft articles of association to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Industry. They returned to Shanghai by train on the night of the 19th and convened a general meeting of all members at the association's address in Gujia Lane at 1:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from fourteen tea firms, including Zhongxin Chang, Yongxinglong, Hongyuanyong, Yuanfengrun, Shengchangsheng, Dashengyong, Rendeyong, Yilong, Shenyuan, Xietai, Tongtai, Xielong, Yitai, and Zhenhe, attended.</p>
<h3>National Products Manufacturers Association Requests External Negotiations on Vietnamese Tax Rates, Striving for Equality to Strengthen Friendship</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that it was requesting negotiations with the Vietnamese government to lower tax rates and ensure equal treatment to benefit the production and sales of domestic goods. The petition stated that the Shanghai office of the Vietnam Chinese National Products Company had sent a letter stating (excerpt) that the Vietnamese government has been specifically raising tax rates on popular Chinese goods imported into Vietnam. For example, canned food, as mentioned in the previous letter, initially had a tax of 12.5 Vietnamese dollars per 100 kilograms of gross weight, but recently this has increased to 58 Vietnamese dollars per 100 kilograms, equivalent to 160 national currency dollars. There are many such examples. According to the Association, this measure by the Vietnamese government obviously disregards national friendship and hinders the promotion of Chinese goods in Vietnam, which contradicts Article 2 of the Sino-French Customs Treaty, which stipulates that "neither of the contracting countries shall, under any pretext, impose on goods transported and imported by the people of the other contracting country, within their own territories, dependencies, colonies, and protectorates, customs duties, inland taxes, or any taxes higher than or different from those paid by their own people or the people of any other country." It is requested that your ministry strictly negotiate with the Vietnamese government to ensure that all goods are taxed equally, in order to strengthen friendship and benefit the export of national goods. This is eagerly awaited. Advisors Yu Daxiong and Cao Yunjie, among others, were present. Chairman Ye Shichang reported that during this trip to Beijing to petition, Wu Dingchang, the actual director, had gone to Zhenjiang to attend the establishment of the National Economic Cooperation Association Zhenjiang Branch. Zhou Yichun, the deputy director, received them and stated that the plan to organize the export tea market (including black and green tea) still needs to be studied further, and a reply will be given in two weeks.</p>

<h3>Autumn Cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enter the Market; Cocoon Merchants Begin Purchasing; Zhejiang Control Association Issues Notice to Prevent Price Gouging, Conducting Separate Inspections After Drying</h3>
<p>Autumn cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang have entered the market, and cocoon merchants have successively started purchasing. All purchases are being made in accordance with the standard prices stipulated by the National Economic Council's Sericulture Improvement Committee. The Zhejiang Silk Control Association has issued a notice to prevent price gouging, conducting separate inspections after drying. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoons Enter the Market; Cocoon Merchants Begin Purchasing</p>
<p>The silk control organizations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will continue to control this year's autumn cocoons as usual. All silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants who wish to purchase autumn cocoons must register with the control organization. Only after passing the review will they be allowed to purchase. Currently, autumn cocoons in areas such as Haining, Jiaxing, Chongde, and Pinghu in Zhejiang, and Wuxi and Liyang in Jiangsu have successively entered the market. All registered and qualified manufacturers have borrowed funds from banks or money houses and started purchasing. Due to the yellowing of mulberry leaves this autumn in both provinces, the harvest is not as good as the spring cocoons. According to estimates by the control organizations, the total output will be 400,000 dan of fresh cocoons. The opening dates for cocoon merchants in various places are longer than for spring cocoons, totaling about seven days.</p>
<p>Preventing Malpractices; Separate Inspection</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Control Committee announced that the standard price for this year's autumn cocoons has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and is calculated based on the size of the reeling ratio. For example, if the reeling ratio is 460 catties, the price of fresh cocoons is 29 yuan per market dan. If the reeling ratio is 430 catties, the price is 32 yuan. If the reeling ratio is 500 catties, the price is 26 yuan. The price is proportionally calculated for reeling ratios between 430 catties and 500 catties. Prices can also be proportionally adjusted for those less than 430 catties or more than 500 catties. However, it is believed that there will be very few improved varieties with reeling ratios exceeding 500 catties. To prevent price gouging, cocoon merchants who purchase fresh cocoons with reeling ratios less than 430 catties or more than 500 catties should store them separately and wait for inspection and release. All cocoon merchants in various counties and cities are required to comply. Anyone who dares to violate this will be punished in accordance with Article 16 of the Provisional Measures for the Control and Management of Cocoon Purchasing. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Second Route Public Buses Began Operation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The city-run public bus system inaugurated the Second Route Caohejing Line yesterday. Buses will run from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, every twelve minutes. Because the seats are comfortable and the fares are low, passengers are happy to ride. According to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, this line will be an important east-west transportation artery in Nanshi. The line runs from the emerging town of Caohejing, through Xujiahui, the new western district, and the densely populated urban and rural areas, to reach the Sixteenth Pier. Xujiahui and the nearby Tushanwan are the center of Catholicism in Shanghai and have a large population. Previously, they relied entirely on the French Concession's Second Route tram and the Nian'er Route public bus for transportation. Now, they can reach the Pudong waterfront via a shorter route. The new western district was formerly the political center of the city and has been developed for twenty years. After the municipal government moved, it is now the location of the municipal party headquarters. In the past five years, the number of residents in the area has gradually increased. In the future, after the establishment of Zhongshan Hospital and the National Medical College, there will be even more hope for development. Therefore, the opening of this route has a significant effect on transportation in the city.</p>

However, as he was unable to speak, the truth was unclear. Later, after an investigation by the Old Gate Police Station, it was discovered that the teenager's real name was Feng Zhibo, 18 years old, from Haiyan, Zhejiang. He had come to Shanghai from his hometown on the 7th of this month. He had studied at Fudan University last semester, and this semester he planned to transfer to the Central Military Academy, but his parents had prevented him.

However, he was running out of money, and he was in a dilemma, so he resorted to this course of action. It is reported that his condition is still critical.</p>

<h3>Sailing Boat Robbed by Pirates</h3>
<p>Zhang Shengqiao, a resident of Pudong, owns a sailing boat that carries passengers and goods between Wuku and Shanghai. The other day, he loaded 134 piculs of white rice from the Shenchang Rice Shop, 30 piculs of white rice from the Qianfeng Rice Shop, and three pieces of tung oil returned by the Qia Taiyi to the Yuanfeng Tung Oil Company at Wuku in the morning and set sail for Shanghai. After sailing to Minhang, he stopped briefly to wait for the tide. He continued sailing at 1 PM. Unexpectedly, when he reached the vicinity of a link between rivers at Yilintang, at around 9 PM at dusk, a small boat blocked his path. Two people standing on the bow of the small boat raised guns and ordered him to stop. The boatmen knew it was a robbery, but under duress, they had to lower the sails and comply. First, two people jumped on board. Then, six bandits with a Hubei accent, all dressed in short clothes, climbed aboard and dropped anchor chains. They immediately began to rob. First, they searched all the boatmen, but found nothing. Then, they put the boatmen in the stern cabin. There were two passengers. In addition to losing all their cash of eight dollars and seventy cents, all their luggage, bedding, rattan boxes, etc., were looted. Before fleeing, they moved six piculs of white rice (including 5.5 piculs under the name of Shenchang Company and 0.5 piculs under the name of Qianfeng Company) and three pieces of tung oil onto their boat and sailed away. Because it was late at night, there were no boats passing by, so no one could hear the calls for help. They had to let them load up and leave. Upon arriving in Shanghai, they reported to the Water Police Bureau and asked them to investigate. It is said that the loss from this robbery was not small, amounting to two or three hundred yuan. Fortunately, no one was injured, which was the great fortune among misfortune.</p>

As a result, the Xinshenghuo side lost. Cantonese individuals Yi Qibin, Wang Zhuan, and Hu Kang were shot and wounded in their hands, legs, and abdomens. They were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The Hongkou Police Department dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and found that Liang Dagang, Xi Yao, and Zhang Wen, three Cantonese employees of the Guanzhen Restaurant at No. 401 Wuchang Road, were involved in the fight. They were detained and sent to the First Special District Court. The victims had not yet arrived, so they were temporarily detained. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing questioned them in the Criminal Division Three. Zhang Wen, one of the suspects, was found to be unrelated and was released. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, stated that the victim Yi Qibin had not yet recovered and was still in the hospital for treatment.

The defense lawyer, Wu Zhenming, stated that the Tongqunle and Xinshenghuo clubs were formal business meeting places, not gatherings of thugs. The two defendants were mistakenly detained and asked the court to consider this. Judge Zhong ordered that they be remanded and rescheduled for verification.</p>

<h3>Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association Establishes Additional Office</h3>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Issues Notice on Railway Warning Signs to Prevent Danger</h3>
<p>Cai Jingjun, the director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, issued a notice yesterday stating, "I have received Municipal Government Order No. 20150, which states, 'I have received Official Letter No. 2142 from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, which states, "Warning signs have been erected at level crossings and bridges along the railway to alert pedestrians and avoid danger. However, pedestrians passing over the tracks either do not pay attention or do not understand the meaning of these warning signs, resulting in frequent injuries and deaths. In addition to further improving these warning signs to make them more visible, and strictly instructing drivers to pay close attention, we plan to ask your government to issue a notice to all townships and towns near the railway tracks, instructing the public to pay attention to the warning signs when approaching the tracks in order to ensure their safety through vigilance. This is of great benefit. We hereby request your approval and response. In light of this, the matter concerns alerting pedestrians and avoiding danger, and should be handled accordingly. In addition to responding to the official letter, the bureau is instructed to immediately comply, issue a notice to inform the public near the railway, etc." In light of this, in addition to instructing subordinates to provide guidance and correction at any time, a notice is hereby issued, urging all citizens to pay attention."</p>
<h3>Copper and Tin Trade Association Encourages Colleagues to Join</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Copper and Tin Trade Association at No. 1079 Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, Shanghai, has found that less than half of the colleagues in Nanshi have joined the association. To comply with the revised Measures for Sanctioning Companies and Firms that do not Join Associations issued by the Central Training Department, the association has notified and urged colleagues who have not yet joined to join quickly. The original notice is recorded as follows: "It is hereby noted that Article 2 of the revised Measures for Sanctioning Companies and Firms that do not Join Associations issued by the Central Training Department states, 'Commercial firms that have not joined a trade association shall be formally required by the trade association to join within a specified period. If they fail to comply within the specified period, the trade association may investigate and present the matter to the competent authorities for sanctions in accordance with the revised sanctioning measures, and order them to suspend operations, etc.' In light of this, it is noted that there are many commercial firms in this city engaged in the copper and tungsten industry, but less than half have joined the association. In order to unite colleagues and maintain the law, this association, with the intention of advising before punishing, again urges all colleagues in the city who have not yet joined to join the association within the specified period. Do not hesitate any longer and violate the law, which may lead to inconvenience."</p>
<h3>Shareholders File Criminal Complaint Against Unauthorized Store Closure</h3>
<p>Guo Genfu, Guo Jinji, Xia Jinrong, and Sun Wenbin hired lawyer Sun Shian and jointly filed a complaint with the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Zhuoting and Sun Delin of breach of trust and embezzlement. It is stated that the plaintiffs and the two defendants jointly opened the Asia Company at Nos. 33 and 34 Xinzha Road, specializing in passenger ship tickets. It was established in 1929, with the defendants serving as managers. It was also decided by the shareholders' meeting that the Yonghe Cigarette Paper Shop would be established within the Asia Company. The business has been operating until this spring. Without reporting to the shareholders' meeting for resolution, the two defendants unilaterally announced the closure of the Yonghe Cigarette Paper Shop. The plaintiffs urged the defendants to submit accounts for settlement for their own benefit, but they refused. Upon investigation, the Yonghe was closed down, and the defendants colluded to defraud and misappropriate funds, totaling more than 10,000 yuan. They request an investigation. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Chen Shuoying opened a hearing on the other day and summoned both defendants. The two defendants did not appear. The plaintiffs were represented by their lawyers, who stated the plaintiffs' intentions. The court adjourned the hearing and scheduled it for 2 PM on the 29th to summon the defendants to court for verification.</p>
<h3>Pig Industry Seeks Solution to Overdue Accounts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pig Industry Trade Association, in view of the fact that in the past year, due to market conditions, business has been slow for various meat shops, resulting in overdue accounts totaling more than one million yuan, which is almost unsustainable for those with weaker capital, recently proposed to convene all members to reorganize the industry regulations to remedy the situation. A notice was sent to all members, stating that the decline of our industry in recent years is becoming more and more serious. The reason for the failure is that the credit sales have been too excessive and unlimited. In order to easily sell goods, we do not ask whether the accounts can be collected. We have greatly expanded our sales, so although the doors are like a market, we are actually strong on the outside but weak on the inside. When it comes to paying the accounts, it is inevitable that there will be delays. If we do not take immediate action to recover, every family will go bankrupt. I hope that all members will be concerned about their own interests and the overall situation of the whole body, and I hope that everyone will express their opinions and discuss the process.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Hangs Herself</h3>

<h3>Opium Den Cracked Down on Miller Road; Four Monks Arrested; Buddhist Disciples Also Addicted to Opium; Sent to Hospital for Prohibition Before Detention</h3>
<p>Xu Azhang, a resident of Yangzhou, recently set up an opium den in the back building of No. 7, Lane 370, Miller Road, providing people with heroin to satisfy their opium addiction and make profits.

However, Xu was very alert and escaped by climbing onto the roof from the balcony and jumping into the alley through the kitchen. There was no way to chase him. The opium smokers Wu Fusheng (local), Jiang Caigen (Ningbo), Cao Jinding (Suzhou), and monks Li Quanchou, Wang Changgui, Feng Wanyu, and Jin Lin (all from Yangzhou), the suspect Xu's wife Chen, 22 small packets of heroin, and eight small opium pipes were all taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday, they were sent to Criminal Division Three of the First Special District Court. There were many monks listening in the court. After questioning, Judge Xiao Xiebo announced the verdict: Wu Fusheng, Jiang Caigen, and Cao Jinding were each sentenced to two years in prison, and the four monks Li, Wang, Feng, and Jin were each sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Before the execution, they were sent to an opium prohibition hospital to be given a prohibition sentence of no more than two months. The exhibits were confiscated. Xu and Chen were released. In view of their own interests, [plaintiffs]</p>

<h3>Killer in Shipmate Murder Case Apprehended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Around 8 AM on the 15th of this month, near the entrance of the Fuxin First Flour Mill on Guangfu Road (west of the Xinza Bridge) in Zhabei, over ten dockworkers were unloading flour from a ship when a rice boat shipmate named He San'nan returned from buying vegetables. He yielded to a car and a handcart, causing them to collide with a dockworker, and two bags of flour to fall. The shipmate was then beaten to death by the dockworkers. The Xinza Branch Bureau dispatched police officers to the scene, and took foreman Gao Yujie, witness Chen Qifu (a leather worker), and dockworkers Bian Yubao, Zu Yechang, and others, a total of ten people, to the bureau. Meanwhile, local guarantor Shen Xiaowu was instructed to report to the Shanghai Local Court. Around 4 PM, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu arrived for an examination and determined that the deceased He San'nan had indeed been beaten to death, with two front teeth knocked out and fatal injuries to the chest and other parts of the body. The local guarantor was instructed to have the deceased's brother, He Shengda, make arrangements for the burial. The police bureau was instructed to bring the culprit to justice for interrogation. However, after the incident, the culprit, feeling guilty, immediately fled, so the foreman Gao Yujie and the other ten, who had already been apprehended, were sent to the court. Unexpectedly, around 11 AM yesterday, the Xinza Branch Bureau received a phone call from the Yangjiadu Police Station in Pudong, reporting that the culprit in the case had been apprehended by the station. Chief Liao of the Zhabei branch bureau immediately dispatched detectives Bao and Qian, along with squad leader Li Shoushen and detectives Zhao Chunsen and Sun Youzhi, carrying official documents, and brought him back around 5 PM. The suspect was identified as Zhao Hongke, 32 years old, from Huaicheng, residing at No. 213 Yaoshi Lane, Xiaoshadu. He previously worked as a laborer at the Huafeng Factory. He confessed without hesitation to killing the shipmate, saying that even if he had not been apprehended, he would have voluntarily surrendered to avoid implicating his many companions. He claimed to have had an old feud with the deceased. He stated that he has a grandmother and mother, Ms. Wang, and a wife and two daughters in his hometown, all dependent on him, and no brothers.</p>

He previously forced his uncle to lend him thirty yuan, and yesterday at 12:30 PM, he tried to force him to lend him several dozen more yuan, but failed. He waited for his uncle near Xinkai River with a bag of excrement, and when his uncle passed by, he threw it in his face, which was terribly foul-smelling. Constable Zhang Shi-Hu arrived and helped apprehend him and brought him to the Yimiao Police Station. Besides ordering the plaintiff to wash off the excrement, the defendant confessed that he had acted out of anger, and now repents and begs for leniency. The interrogating officer explained that insulting a respected relative is a serious offense. Since he is now remorseful, he was given a lighter sentence of fifteen days of detention.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read a news item in your newspaper about a motorcycle falling into the river on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, claiming that "I am a tax inspector stationed in Shanghai by the Finance Bureau, and on the 18th, I was driving a motorcycle on the Shanghai-Minhang South Zhejiang Road line in the Liangmiao area in western Shanghai. Because I was driving too far, both I and the motorcycle fell into the river. I was seriously injured and unable to get up. Later, I was sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment." This is not in accordance with the facts. Now I will inform you of the details and request a correction. I work for a manufacturer and have never worked for the Finance Bureau or any other agency. On that day, I was driving to Hangzhou for sightseeing. When passing through Qianliangmiao, I was overturned due to unevenness. Fortunately, only my arm was slightly scratched and I was not injured in the waist or legs. I returned to Shanghai from Minhang and was not treated at Guangci Hospital. I believe that it was a false rumor that caused my relatives and friends to inquire after me. I am very grateful and hope for a correction. Respectfully, Liu Shunchang, September 20th, No. 2171, Xujiahui Xietu Road.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province's Education Expenditure for the Past Three Years: Funding Increases Annually, with Compulsory Education Receiving the Most</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province's educational expenditure has been streamlined in recent years, and attention has been paid to its sources, resulting in a more stable foundation and an increase in the amount of funding each year. The total expenditure on education in the 22nd year of the Republic was 4,446,884 yuan, accounting for 20.198% of the province's total expenditure. The total expenditure on education in the 23rd year was 4,446,568 yuan, accounting for 16.76% of the province's total expenditure. The total expenditure on education in the 24th year was 4,578,028 yuan, accounting for 15.86% of the province's total expenditure. The budget for the province's educational expenditure for the 25th year has also been compiled and submitted to the provincial government for review by the central government. The total expenditure listed is 5,736,280 yuan, an increase of 1,157,252 yuan compared to the 24th year (the actual expenditure now is less than this number). The largest increase is in funding for compulsory education and vocational schools. The increase in funding for vocational schools is significant, accounting for more than 32% of the funding for secondary schools, which is not far from the Ministry's requirement of 35%. The allocation of various educational funds in the province in recent years has also been carried out in strict accordance with the standards promulgated by the Ministry. The percentages are as follows:</p>
<p>Type of Expenditure 22nd Year 23rd Year 24th Year</p>
<p>Higher Education 4.28 5.64 7.65</p>
<p>Secondary Education 52.41 54.42 55.11</p>
<p>Primary Education 9.47 9.61 9.02</p>
<p>Social Education 15.11 15.68 16.21</p>
<p>Educational Administration 6.91 6.87 6.96</p>
<p>Other Expenses 11.82 7.78 5.05</p>
<p>Furthermore, the province's allocation of secondary education funding has been improved year by year in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, and it is expected that the Ministry's standard will be reached by the prescribed deadline (26th year). The percentage of secondary education funding allocation for the past three years is recorded below:</p>
<p>Category Ministry Standard 22nd Year 23rd Year 24th Year</p>
<p>General Middle School 40.00 49.80 46.58 46.63</p>
<p>Normal School 25.00 30.93 28.11 16.08</p>
<p>Vocational School 35.00 19.27 25.31 27.29</p>
<h3>Problems in High School Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry Teaching</h3>
<p>The Education College of Central University is Addressing the Problem - Designated as the Central Task for This Year</p>
<p>As previously reported in this newspaper, the experiments and tests conducted by the Education Research Institute of the Education College of Central University on the problem of English teaching in middle schools have concluded, and a detailed report will be published soon. It is now known that the central task of the institute for this year is the "Problem of High School Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry Teaching." At a time when the government's university policy is shifting towards science and engineering, the question of how to assess and improve the mathematics, physics, and chemistry levels of high school students, and how to effectively improve teaching methods, is extremely important. However, without applying experimental methods for precise empirical research, it is not easy to find solutions. But this type of testing has not yet been tried in our country, and the problem of high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry teaching may become even more serious. The Education College of Central University has expanded based on the education departments of Southeast University and Nanjing Higher Normal School, and its talent and equipment have improved year by year. It has long been known for its expertise in testing. Its efforts in recent years have been highly praised. Furthermore, Central University's science and engineering colleges have developed rapidly in the past four years, and more and more experts in mathematics, physics, and chemistry have been recruited. The college can utilize the talent and equipment of other colleges on the one hand, and closely cooperate with experimental schools on the other, so that experienced high school science teachers can participate, and multiple psychologists, testing, and statistics experts from the college can oversee the completion. Once the testing is completed, the contribution will be significant. All plans have been decided, but funding is still being sought.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Social Bureau Calls Meeting with Teachers of Silk Factory Literacy Classes</h3>
<p>Director Pan Delivers Encouraging Speech; Factory Literacy Classes Begin Today</p>
<p>The literacy classes for silk factory workers are approved to begin today. The Social Bureau has completed the registration of literacy teachers, with a total of 873 qualified teachers. They were summoned to a meeting yesterday morning at 8 AM, presided over by Section Chief Xu Yefu of the Third Section. After the formal greetings, the chairman first reported on the significance of conducting literacy classes for workers and the purpose of convening the meeting. Director Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, stating that every citizen should have (1) physical strength, (2) intelligence, and (3) morality, and should concentrate and unite to fulfill the duties of a citizen. The government's purpose in conducting literacy education for workers is to provide literacy education to illiterate people and to teach them civic knowledge, so that in addition to becoming literate, they understand how to be a good person. Everyone should understand their own tasks and the importance of their responsibilities. After individual interviews, qualified individuals were assigned as teachers to various factories. However, China's industry is backward, and under the current economic depression, we must strive to revitalize. Economic construction requires cooperation between labor and management. Class warfare and conflicts between labor and management are suicidal policies that China does not need. Taking silk factories as an example, the situation was good ten years ago, but in recent years, due to the decline of the silk industry, the situation is extremely bad. Factories start work after new cocoons come on the market and stop after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Although this year is slightly better than last year, it cannot be said for certain that it can last through the year. Workers in operating factories have food to eat, while workers in closed factories have no food to eat. Therefore, anyone who violates the Three Principles of the People or slanders the Party and the state will be severely punished. Everyone is serving the country and the nation, sacrificing time and energy, and undertaking arduous work, which is greatly admired. After workers receive literacy education, they can be responsible, trustworthy, and have a sense of honor and shame, so that the nation can be revived. Everyone should understand that they are serving the country, not just doing a job. Serving as a literacy teacher is the same as serving as a member of the defense corps. What is admired is those who are willing to take responsibility. Li Wanqing then gave guidance on teaching, and Wang Gang gave guidance on administration. Finally, individual group discussions were held, and the meeting adjourned at 11 AM.</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the Law School</h3>

Over a hundred people attended, including Chen Zhigao, Jin Guangmei, Yin Jin, and Guo Qixun. The school's alumni already had an alumni association, so after discussion, fifteen executive and supervisory committee members of the alumni association, including Wu Kaixian and Chen Zhigao, were first appointed as preparatory committee members. In addition, fifteen people, including Tang Naixin, Shen Ding, and Feng Xiancheng, were appointed to form a celebration committee, totaling thirty people.

<h3>Overview of Japanese Schools in Shanghai (2)</h3>
<p>— Special Report by This Newspaper, Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>2. School Buildings and Facilities</p>
<p>There are a total of six Japanese school buildings in Shanghai; because the school building for the Industrial Youth School is attached inside the Northern Japanese Ordinary Elementary School building. The architectural area and the number of classrooms in each school building are different. Now, the investigation of the architectural situation of each school building is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Architectural Overview Table of Japanese School Buildings in Shanghai</p>
<p>Note: One ping equals thirty-six square feet</p>
<p>The types and number of special classrooms in each school vary slightly. Now, the special classrooms of the Central Ordinary Elementary School are listed separately, so that one can see a glimpse of them. The school has seven special classrooms: one craft classroom, one science classroom, one etiquette classroom, one sewing classroom, one drawing classroom, and two singing classrooms. Other rooms include: craft room preparation room, craft materials room, science preparation room, specimen hanging picture room, hygiene room, staff library, children's reading room, martial arts equipment room, sports equipment room, bathroom, reception room, etc.</p>
<p>The Japanese Girls' High School also has one large Chinese, Japanese, and Western cooking experiment room, two tea ceremony practice rooms, one Western-style and one Japanese-style etiquette room, and one dyeing practice room. A new swimming pool was built last year and opened during the summer for male and female students from all Japanese schools in Shanghai to practice swimming. Recently, the Central Ordinary Elementary School is also building a swimming pool for elementary school children to practice swimming.</p>
<p>3. Administrative Facilities</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the Japanese schools in Shanghai are established by the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association, so the management rights of each school are in the hands of the cadres of the Residents' Association. The head of the Residents' Association is nominally responsible for managing the schools, but in practice, it is managed by the School Affairs Committee. The members of the School Affairs Committee are appointed by the head of the Residents' Association and are responsible to the head. The planning and management of the construction of school buildings and the allocation of funds are carried out by the School Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>The recruitment of teachers and staff in each school is done by the Japanese Ministry of Education (i.e., the Ministry of Education), which introduces candidates to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (i.e., the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submits the list of candidates to the Consul-General in Shanghai, who selects and appoints from the list. The principals are directly appointed by the Japanese Emperor upon request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so the principals are appointed officials.</p>
<p>All training and teaching matters in the school are handled entirely by the principal. In addition to the principal, each school has one vice-principal to assist in handling training and teaching matters in the school. The vice-principal can act as the principal when the principal is on leave; when the principal retires, the vice-principal can be promoted to principal. In elementary schools, each school employs a government-certified nurse to oversee children's health and hygiene in the school.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the administration of each school is planned work. Each school formulates a work plan for the coming year in March; formulates a work plan for the coming month at the end of each month; and formulates a work plan for the coming week at the end of each week. The daily work is carried out in three stages: (1) Work before class each day: issue children's attendance records, pay attention to school announcements, monitors inspect the interior and exterior of the school building, protect the safety of naughty children, prepare teaching aids, attend staff meetings, and patrol the classroom. (2) Work after school each day: supervise and guide day students, report student absences, pay attention to school announcements, process children's grades, research guidance materials, schedule tomorrow's work, inspect the interior and exterior of the school building, extracurricular guidance and homework guidance, handle assigned affairs, research and self-cultivation. (3) Work during the day: conduct morning meetings, lead children's assembly and dispersal, check and record absent children, treat sick children, implement learning guidance, advise on training policies, apply learning tools, care for children, and guide children's lunch.</p>
<p>4. Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>The revenue and expenditure of Japanese schools in Shanghai are handled by the Residents' Association. The Residents' Association's revenue and expenditure items and documents are audited four times a year by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has seven expert members, who are elected by the Residents' Association's general annual meeting. The Audit Committee submits the audit results to the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai for review. The final accounts for each fiscal year must also be submitted to the Residents' Association's general annual meeting and approved by the Consul-General.</p>
<p>The standard of tuition fees charged by each school is as follows:</p>
<p>Elementary School: Elementary and High Levels – Free</p>
<p>Elementary School: Advanced Two Classes (Junior High School Grades 1 and 2) – One Yuan per month</p>
<p>Girls' High School – Five Yuan per month</p>
<p>Vocational Course of Girls' High School – Eight Yuan per month</p>
<p>Industrial Youth School – One Yuan per month</p>

<h3>Jin De Association Tries Out New Sound, Defeats British Navy 8-2; Jin De Controls the Game, British Army Has Difficulty Unleashing Skills</h3>
<p>The Jin De Football Team, in preparation for participating in the Chinese Football Association, held a friendly match with the British Navy's St. Vincent Squadron at Shen Park yesterday to practice their skills. The British ship had drawn 2-2 with the Western Police team at Yiyuan last week, so their strength was also quite strong. Although Jin De is a new team, all of the players are top athletes, so no less than 1,500 people admired the team and watched the game. Greenhill, the president of the Western Union, Atkinson, the president of the Referees Association, and Hu Xiansheng, the appeals committee member, also came to see the strength of the Jin De team. As a result of the match, Jin De took the lead 5-1 in the first half, and won 8-2 overall. In order to increase experience, they will hold a second trial with the Portuguese or St. Francis team next week. The strength of the Jin De Association can already be seen from the results of yesterday's game, but unfortunately, it was rejected by the Western Union authorities, which is a pity. There may be a possibility of salvage, and it will be known within a few days. The battle situation of yesterday's game is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>After the toss, the British army attacked first. Xu Jingcheng intercepted midway and sent it to the front. Luo Douwen ran happily and passed it to the center forward, Gu Jingchu, who scored. Liu Chushu enforced the law impartially and announced offside. Soon after, Zhang Jinhai broke through from the middle, stole the ball from Carl, and joined forces with Gao Xiquan to attack. The British left back, Fei Lie, rushed to rescue. Xiao Gao was busy and kicked the ball clearly, scoring a goal. Only five minutes into the game, the British army had lost a city. They repeatedly wanted to launch sneak attacks, but the Jin De's defense was solid and difficult to cross. Zhang Jinhai became excited and attacked the goal alone, scoring again. Before long, Jinhai received assistance from Luo and Gu, scoring two more goals. Luo Douwen, seeing others succeeding, couldn't help but want to try. He took the opportunity and scored with a header. In an instant, Jin De had defeated the British Navy with a score of 4-0, leaving them with no power to fight back. As the Jin De forwards repeatedly reported victories, the defense was inevitably a little sparse. The central zone suddenly became tight. Osmond transported ammunition, and Hale took the opportunity to invade, shooting into the net. The Jin De goalkeeper was too short to save it. Soon after, the Jin De army came like a landslide again. Luo Douwen hooked the ball in from the baseline, hitting the crossbar straight down. Gu Jingchu saw accurately and headed the ball in again. Before long, lemon time arrived, and Jin De took the lead 5-1.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After reorganizing the formation and fighting again, the British Navy remained the same and couldn't cross the middle line. Within fifteen minutes, neither side advanced. Burke mishandled the ball, and it fell to Gao Xiquan's feet. He crossed Philip, shot hard on the ground, and scored again. The British army also fought desperately, and actually got two chances to shoot, but both were lost due to being too high. After several rounds, Zhang Jinhai took the opportunity to attack directly again, scoring a goal. The ball slid into Gao Xiquan's feet again. The five forwards of Jin De rushed in. Gao Xiquan passed to Gu Jingchu on the left, avoiding the defender's line. Li Qu rushed out to rescue. Gu passed to Gao again, taking the opportunity to flick the ball. The eight-to-one victory was in hand. At this time, the British army desperately counterattacked, and Jin De also pressed forward, so they didn't pay attention to the defense. The British center forward, Reynolds, secretly crossed Chen Cang and shot from afar. Hu Bingquan blocked it with both hands, but the ball was too fast and slipped, and he lost it. He quickly turned around to hook it out, but it had already crossed the goal line, so another city was lost. At this time, it was not far from the end of the game. Both sides advanced and retreated. Jin De, with victory in hand, didn't care too much. They sounded the retreat, and Jin De won 8-2. The scorers were Gao Xiquan and Zhang Jinhai with three goals each, and Luo Douwen with two. The lineup is as follows:</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Depreciation of the French Franc and the Stability of Our Country's Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jie</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Recently, the French government's ban on the transportation of military supplies to Spain has triggered resentment from the Popular Front. Labor strikes have resurfaced, causing political turmoil, which has affected the status of the French franc and brought about another crisis. On September 7th, the selling pressure on the French franc suddenly intensified, causing a sharp decline in its exchange rate against the British pound. It fell from 76.43 francs per pound at the beginning of this month to 76.94 francs on the 17th. For the French franc, this is the lowest price this year. At the same time, capital is fleeing and panic is spreading. On the 9th and 11th of this month, a total of US$21,005,000 worth of gold flowed to the United States. Statistics for the flow to the United Kingdom have not yet been seen, but according to London telecommunications, the number of corporate deposits in French currency received by the Bank of England has been increasing daily.</p>
<p>The recent depreciation of the French franc, while seemingly caused by political and labor unrest, actually has a more fundamental cause. The fierce currency devaluation competition among countries in recent years, the unprecedented economic difficulties since France adhered to the gold standard, and the financial panic caused by the atmosphere of war, all fundamentally make it difficult to maintain the par value of the French franc. As long as it is affected by political volatility or speculative attacks, panic will immediately occur, and this has happened four times this year alone. Given the current political turbulence in Europe, it can be confidently predicted that French franc panics will continue to occur frequently in the future. Some argue that the depreciation of the French franc is temporary, and that once the political and labor unrest is resolved, the French franc will return to stability. However, this view overlooks the fundamental causes of the French franc crisis.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Due to the fluctuations of the French franc, a large amount of French francs were sold off in the European financial market and British pounds were purchased, which greatly increased the demand for British pounds and strengthened its exchange rate. The British-American exchange rate rose in tandem under these circumstances, rising from US$5.0325 per pound at the beginning of this month to US$5.065625 on the 17th. For the British pound, this is the highest price this year. In February of this year, the US dollar once fell, and the British-American exchange rate rose to US$5.02625, which is still far below the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>This situation clearly runs counter to the British policy of gradually depreciating the pound and is very unfavorable to the United Kingdom. Therefore, when the French franc panic started, the British Exchange Equalisation Account intervened to maintain the exchange rate, both to prevent the British-French exchange rate from rising excessively and to bring the British-American exchange rate back down. However, as of the 17th, the effectiveness of this British intervention has not been significant. The French franc price only experienced a slight rebound on the 10th, and then continued to fall. The US dollar followed the same pattern, as detailed in the table below:</p>
<p>British-French Exchange Rate British-American Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Francs per Pound Dollars per Pound</p>
<p>September 1st 76.43 5.0325</p>
<p>7th 76.56 5.04125</p>
<p>8th 76.75 5.055</p>
<p>9th 76.83 5.05875</p>
<p>10th 76.78 5.055</p>
<p>11th 76.84 5.05875</p>
<p>12th 76.84 5.05875</p>
<p>14th 76.84 5.06125</p>
<p>15th 76.91 5.065</p>
<p>16th 76.90 5.0625</p>
<p>17th 76.94 5.065625</p>
<p>From the table above, we can see the fluctuation of the spot price of the French franc. At this time, the forward price of the French franc is also very weak, which further reflects the bleak prospects of the French franc.</p>
<p>In the current triangular relationship between the British pound, US dollar, and French franc, it is very difficult for the United Kingdom to support the French franc and keep the price of the pound relatively low, because the foundation of the French franc is fundamentally fragile. The selling pressure on the French franc from various parties is not entirely due to speculation, but also due to a large volume of spot transactions in French francs. While the selling pressure was very intense during the panic, continued selling persisted even after the panic subsided, albeit at a slightly slower pace. Therefore, the trend of the French franc exchange rate is fundamentally downward, and the British Exchange Equalisation Account cannot improve it. Given this environment, the price of the British pound will only continue to rise, and the exchange rate between the British-French and British-American currencies will undoubtedly increase.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The continuous changes in the British-French exchange rate have a small impact on our country's currency relations, while the rise in the British-American exchange rate directly affects our country's foreign exchange rate. Originally, at the beginning of the currency reform, the Chinese currency was linked to the British pound, with one yuan of national currency fixed at one shilling and two and a half pence. The value of one yuan of national silver currency equivalent to US$0.2975 was obtained through the arbitrage of British-American exchange rates. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>If the British-American exchange rate does not change, then our country's exchange rates against the British pound and the US dollar will be in a balanced state and can remain stable. However, the British-American exchange rate has recently fluctuated greatly. For example, in February of this year, the British-American exchange rate rose to US$5.02625. If China's foreign exchange rate had remained unchanged at this time, a contradiction would have arisen between the exchange rates against the British pound and the US dollar. Speculators could have made huge profits in Shanghai by using arbitrage methods. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>Profits obtained using arbitrage methods (Note 1)</p>
<p>Therefore, China had to choose between lowering the British exchange rate and raising the American exchange rate. At that time, China chose the latter method, raising the Chinese-American exchange rate from US$0.2975 per 100 Chinese yuan to US$0.3025, while maintaining the Chinese-British exchange rate at its original level.</p>
<p>Now that the British-American exchange rate has risen again, the exchange rates of one shilling and two and a half pence against the British pound and approximately 30 yuan against the US dollar, which have been in place since February of this year, have once again created a contradiction between the two, and the situation can be said to be no different from the last time. However, the method that our country should adopt is different.</p>
<p>This time, the legal exchange rate of the Central Bank has not changed, but the actual selling and buying prices have changed. On September 9th, Mr. Xi Demao, manager of the Sino-British Bank, issued a statement saying that the Central Bank, under the instructions of the Minister of Finance, would increase the difference between the legal price and the buying and selling prices of foreign exchange. Previously, the difference was one-eighth for the British pound, one-quarter for the US dollar, and one cent for the Japanese yen. Now, it has been changed to one-quarter for the British pound, one-half for the US dollar, and two cents for the Japanese yen, in order to prevent arbitrage speculation in the local market. At the same time, according to the author's investigation, the Central Bank's selling price for the British pound is one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter, and the buying price is one shilling, two pence, and three-quarters. The selling price for the US dollar is US$29.50, and the buying price is US$30.50.</p>
<p>The legal exchange rate is only an indication, and those who observe actual practice should take the bank's selling price as the standard. Judging by the selling price, the price of our country's currency is slightly lower than before. The Central Bank's daily selling prices are not published, so the daily selling prices of HSBC are listed here, and their trend is the same as the Central Bank's selling prices.</p>
<p>Daily Exchange Rates of HSBC</p>
<p>(Note) British Exchange Rate: Number of British Pounds Equal to 1 Yuan of Chinese Currency; American Exchange Rate: Number of Yuans of Chinese Currency Equal to 100 US Dollars; Japanese Exchange Rate: Number of Yuans of Chinese Currency Equal to 100 Japanese Yen; French Exchange Rate: Number of Yuans of Chinese Currency Equal to 100 French Francs</p>
<p>Observing the exchange rate changes in recent months, the stability of our country's foreign exchange is very significant, with the largest fluctuation not exceeding 1.1%. Although the change is very subtle, it is normal. Before September 9th, the pound exchange rate was still stable and unchanged. After the 9th, the pound exchange rate also changed. It can be seen that the new currency system is not a pound exchange standard system, and the Chinese-British exchange rate is not fixed.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content of this foreign exchange change, the stability of the exchange rate against the US dollar is noteworthy. According to the HSBC market, the exchange rates against the British pound, Japanese yen, and French franc have all moved, while the US dollar exchange rate has remained unchanged, which is the opposite of the situation in January of this year, when the British pound exchange rate was unchanged and the US dollar exchange rate was allowed to float. This point can be linked to the signing of the Sino-American Silver Agreement for consideration. Another point worth noting is that the exchange rate changes against the British pound and Japanese yen this time have both lowered the price of our country's currency. The author believes that this measure is beneficial to our country's trade, and that a gradual policy of low exchange rates should be adopted in the future. A gradual policy of low exchange rates is beneficial to trade and does not hinder financial stability.</p>
<p>Now it can be known that changes in international currencies will naturally affect our group's exchange situation. This is not only the case for our country, but for any country. Modern international finance is interwoven and interconnected, and no country can isolate itself from the influence of other major countries. So the influence is natural. The question is whether the changes in our country's exchange rate can be based on our country's interests. If so, then even if affected, we will still retain the autonomy of our currency, just like the United Kingdom. If not, then the harm will be infinite.</p>
<p>In today's era when countries use exchange rate policies as tools of economic warfare, our country must preserve this last line of defense.</p>
<p>—September 18th—</p>
<p>Note 1: This is purely calculated according to the legal exchange rate. In fact, there are still differences between the trade price and the cost price. However, this difference is usually very small, so when the exchange rate is out of balance by a corner, arbitrage can be profitable.</p>

<h3>Review of the Bumper Harvest Problem</h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this spring, the spring famine problem in various places has been particularly serious due to the poor autumn harvest last year. Consequently, in the first quarter, the import of foreign rice reached 440,493 metric tons, used to relieve the food shortage. Recently, however, the situation has drastically changed. Since the sowing season this spring, the weather has been favorable, and no major disasters have occurred, leading to predictions of a nationwide bumper harvest this year. In late August, Minister of the Interior Jiang Zuobin reported on the bumper harvest issue during the 39th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at the central government. He briefly stated: "Every year, we receive telegrams reporting disasters and famines from provinces across the country, pouring in incessantly. But this year is different. As of now, the Ministry of the Interior has not received a single document reporting a disaster or famine. Furthermore, the reports I have received privately indicate that all provinces across the country are experiencing a bumper harvest this year. I learned in Anhui that the province is expecting a 140% harvest this year. In Lu, I met with two central committee members from Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan, who informed me that Jiangxi also expects a 140% harvest this year, and Hubei a full 100%. This situation is unprecedented in decades and is a cause for celebration for the people nationwide. However, with such a bountiful harvest, we should further improve our warehousing and management methods to prevent farmers from being harmed by low grain prices. Regarding the improvement of warehousing, the renovation of old warehouses, and the construction of new ones, the Ministry of the Interior has drafted regulations, which are currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan. Once approved, they will be disseminated to all provinces for implementation, ensuring that this unprecedented bumper harvest is not damaged by poor storage..." At the same time, during the weekly memorial service of the National Government, President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke also gave a similar report. (See Shen Bao, September 1) From this, we can observe that the hope of a nationwide bumper harvest this year is likely to materialize. Now, let's examine the issue of the bumper harvest below.</p>
<p>(II) General Review of the Bumper Harvest Problem</p>
<p>(1) The Bumper Harvest Problem and Economic Cycles</p>
<p>The method of agricultural management in our country remains in a state of tenancy farming. The abundance or scarcity of the harvest is left to "fate." Therefore, throughout history, years of abundance and scarcity have been like waves, with neither perpetual famine nor constant prosperity. As the saying goes, "After a year of famine comes a year of abundance," which is the idea. This situation closely resembles the cyclical nature of social and economic cycles. The following is a compilation of the agricultural situation and social and economic cycles in China since the Republic of China, tentatively compiled by Yao Qingsan:</p>
<p>It is noted that Yao's tentative compilation of the economic history of China is based on materials from China in the "Business Annals" co-edited by Professor Mitchell and Dr. Thorp of the United States. Therefore, the economic cycle is divided into four periods: (1) Prosperity, (2) Depression, (3) Recession (the transition from prosperity to depression), and (4) Revival (the transition from depression to prosperity). Since the Republic of China, there have been eleven years of bumper harvests. (Excluding leap years.) There has been a bumper harvest every three years on average. During the economic depression period, there were seven bumper harvests, accounting for 64% of the total number of bumper harvests since the Republic of China. During the economic recovery period, there were two bumper harvests, accounting for 18% of the total number of bumper harvests since the Republic of China. During the economic prosperity period, there were two bumper harvests, accounting for 18% of the total number of bumper harvests since the Republic of China. However, during the economic recession period, there has never been a bumper harvest. From this, we can infer that the abundance of harvests is a natural mechanism driven by the improvement of social and economic cycles, and it is also sufficient to tighten the original driving force of all economic organizations. Therefore, there are particularly many bumper harvests during the economic depression period, which is the principle that extremes beget their opposites.</p>
<p>The determination of a bumper harvest is the result of reduced disasters. By observing the previous table, it is clear that in years of floods and droughts, the harvest is inevitably poor. Conversely, the years are abundant. However, in 1928, there was a drought in the Northwest, but the rice harvest was still bountiful, which seems contradictory at first glance. It should be noted that the Northwest is not a major rice-producing area, and the drought in the first year was not enough to affect the overall situation. However, after two consecutive years of drought, the people in the rice-producing areas of the Huai River and Yangtze River basins transported grain to provide relief. As a result, it was impossible for Central and Southern China to remain prosperous alone. Therefore, in 1929 and 1930, the rice harvest nationwide was poor.</p>
<p>(2) The Bumper Harvest Problem and Seasonal Changes</p>
<p>Observing the supply and demand of rice throughout the year, the four months of September, October, November, and December are the season when the supply of rice exceeds demand, commonly known as the new grain market season. The four months of May, June, July, and August are the season when the demand for rice exceeds supply, commonly known as the lean season. Low grain prices harming farmers occur during the new grain market season, while high grain prices harming the people occur during the lean season. Therefore, the season most closely related to the bumper harvest problem is the new grain market season when the supply of rice exceeds demand. By examining the average price of new rice during the bumper harvest seasons since the Republic of China, we can often get a glimpse of the extent of farmers' losses.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Average Price of New Rice during Bumper Harvest Periods since the Republic of China with the Average Rice Price of the Current Year</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, the average rice price during the new grain market season is lower than the average rice price of the year in every year. However, during the new grain market season in 1919, the price of new rice was 6% higher than the average price of the year. This was because the European War had just ended, the Paris Peace Conference was signed, and countries purchased large quantities from rice-producing countries due to food shortages after the war. At the same time, our government abolished the ban on rice exports. As a result, large quantities of rice flowed out. Therefore, even during the new grain market season of a bumper harvest, there was still a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply. This is a special situation and cannot be taken as a standard.</p>
<p>(III) Review of This Year's Bumper Harvest Problem</p>
<p>(1) Forecast of This Year's Harvest</p>
<p>It is currently unknown how much rice will be produced this year. The estimates of 100% and 140% from various provinces are merely psychological speculations and cannot be regarded as reliable standards. However, based on the estimation of rice production in the last five years, this year's harvest may only slightly increase compared to the bumper harvest of 1933. Please see the table below for the rice production situation in the past five years:</p>
<p>It is noted that 1932 and 1933 were the most impressive years for rice harvests in the past five years. Therefore, the rice stored in the spring of 1934, according to experienced rice traders, amounted to as many as one million bags of foreign rice in Shanghai alone. Although not domestic rice, it was ultimately due to the bumper harvest of domestic rice that there was no sale. The rice stored in Wuxi was also about 1.3 million piculs, and it was said that Hunan had three years' worth of rice stored. (See Social and Economic Monthly, Volume 1, Issue 3) Furthermore, according to a report from the Jiangxi Economic Committee, at the end of 1933, Jiangxi produced 111,428,197 piculs of rice, so after deducting consumption within the province, there were still over a million piculs that could be transported out. The situation in other provinces was also similar. Regarding the yield per mu (unit of land area) in this year (1933), the rice planting area in 1933 was 279,905,000 mu, (see Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station) and the average yield per mu was 3.5 shi (unit of volume) of grain.</p>
<p>As for the rice production situation this year, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi spoke freely with a reporter from the New News Agency when he received him the other day, discussing the central government's financial situation. He said, "This year's agricultural harvest is due to heaven's help, but also half due to human effort. In recent years, the construction of water conservancy projects in various provinces, the expansion of planting areas, and the improvement of planting techniques have all increased production. Therefore, I hope that the people nationwide will not only be happy about this bountiful year but also pay close attention to how to increase production further. Because according to our statistics, there are no less than 400 million mu of arable land in our country, but only 150 million mu are currently used for cultivation!..." (See Shen Bao, September 7) Today, Kong's estimate of the current cultivated area and the 1,534,400,000 mu of the national crop area estimated by the former Directorate of Statistics of the Government are still the same. However, Kong did not mention whether the percentage of rice crop area in the national crop area has increased. According to the author's knowledge, the Statistical Bureau's survey period was four years ago. At that time, the bureau estimated the rice crop area to be 183,546,000 mu, accounting for 18% of the national crop area. Comparing it with the Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station in 1933, the two seem to be consistent. However, since the central government vigorously implemented the policies of prohibiting drugs and opium after 1934, the land originally used for planting opium and other toxic substances has mostly been converted to planting food crops. But this political situation was after the Statistical Bureau's survey. Therefore, we speculate that the national rice crop area may have the potential to expand. Moreover, in some provinces, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian, the rice crop has two or even three harvests a year. If we follow the estimate of the Statistical Bureau, the actual rice crop area only accounts for 14% of the national crop area. Therefore, Lin Xichun estimated that it should be doubled to 28%. (See Social and Economic Monthly, Volume 2, Issue 3, pages 46) However, according to our speculation, the rice crop area should account for between 20% and 25% of the national crop area.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume that the rice crop area this year accounts for 24% of the national crop area. (The national crop area is still based on the estimate of the Statistical Bureau.) Then the rice planting area this year should be 368,256,000 mu. Assuming an average yield of 3.5 shi of grain per mu, the estimated harvest this year should be 1,288,896,000 piculs. This is an increase of 33% compared to the bumper harvest of 1932 and an increase of 31% compared to the bumper harvest of 1933. Whether this figure is reliable remains to be proven in the future. However, there is one issue that we cannot ignore: in provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, there are two or even three harvests a year. If we consider the economic principle of the "Law of Diminishing Returns," the more harvests there are, the lower the yield will be. This is an immutable principle, and anyone with basic economic knowledge can understand it. Therefore, whether the yield per mu can consistently reach 3.5 shi of grain is a question. Furthermore, the yield of 3.5 shi was calculated based on the rice production and planting area in 1933. However, when the Central Agricultural Experiment Station surveyed the rice planting area, it is possible that people underreported or omitted their rice fields due to tax evasion. Furthermore, there is no consistent standard for calculating the area of fields in our country. Some use rice seedlings as the standard, measuring one mu by the number of seedlings that can be planted. Others use plow furrows as the standard, calculating the number of furrows in plowing as one mu. There are countless methods. With different calculation methods, the size of the fields varies. Therefore, there are reasons to doubt the yield of 3.5 shi of grain. This is another issue. According to experts' estimates, the productivity of our country's land is only higher than that of India. Before the improvement of production technology, the average yield per mu is only about 2 shi. This is another issue. Currently, our agricultural management methods remain under tenancy farming, which only reduces the productivity of the land and does not increase it. This year's bumper harvest is actually due to the favorable natural environment, not the result of human methods. Therefore, based on various observations, the estimated bumper harvest of rice this year is, at best, unlikely to exceed 100 million shi. If we estimate rice production at about 700 million shi based on the customary 73% conversion from grain to rice.</p>
<p>(2) Estimation of National Consumption</p>
<p>There is currently no official government estimate of the average annual consumption of rice by the people. Although there are unofficial estimates from private sources, they vary greatly and are inconsistent. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the total annual consumption. Lin Xichun once synthesized materials from various sources and estimated that an average of 2.2 piculs of rice per person per year would be sufficient. He also calculated that the national population is 450 million, and the rice-eating population accounts for one-third, or 300 million. Therefore, the annual demand for rice is 660,000,000 piculs.</p>
<p>According to Lin's estimated figures, this year's bumper harvest of rice, in addition to national consumption, would have a surplus of 40 million piculs. However, in reality, this is not the case. According to the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, in our country, rice, in addition to being used for legitimate human consumption, is also used for brewing alcohol. The amount accounts for 18% of the total amount used for human food. Based on this calculation, of the 700 million piculs of rice harvested this year, 126 million piculs must be deducted by private wineries for brewing alcohol. Only 574 million piculs are available for legitimate human consumption! There is still a shortage of 86 million piculs of rice, which cannot be obtained. Otherwise, there will be a famine for more than three months, or more than 30 million people will have to rely on foreign rice.</p>
<p>(3) A Glimpse of Surpluses and Deficits in Various Regions</p>
<p>From a geographical perspective, the richest rice-producing areas in our country are the provinces south of 32 degrees north latitude, such as Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, which are all rice-surplus provinces. By examining the domestic trade of rice in these provinces during the bumper harvest year of 1933, we can get a glimpse of their rice surpluses.</p>
<p>1933 was a year of bumper rice harvest. Anhui Province exported 3,491,339 piculs of rice to other provinces, making it the province with the largest surplus of food in the country that year. Hunan Province has always been a rice-producing area. There is an old saying, "If Hunan and Guangdong are prosperous, the world will be fed!" That year, the province exported 618,101 piculs to other provinces, ranking second among the food-surplus provinces, while only 46 piculs were imported into Hunan from other provinces! Jiangxi Province exported 530,941 piculs to other provinces that year, ranking third, while 3,793 piculs were imported into Jiangxi from other provinces. Sichuan exported 9,756 piculs to other provinces. The total amount exported to other provinces by the above four provinces was 4,650,377 piculs, while the total amount imported into these provinces from other provinces was 3,839 piculs, less than one-thousandth of the exported amount. In 1933, the national rice production was 984,190,000 piculs, and the surplus of rice in these four provinces accounted for 5% of the national rice production. However, some of the rice exported from these four provinces that year had already been processed into brown rice, so the actual surplus was more than 5% of the national production. According to our speculation, it should be around 7-8%. As for this year's situation, can the rice surplus in these four provinces be higher than in 1933? According to our research and estimation from various aspects, at most, it will only be equal to 1933. This is because 1933 inherited the bumper harvest of 1932. Due to various reasons, the surplus rice from the bumper harvest of 1932 could not be transported to other provinces. Therefore, in 1933, in addition to the bumper harvest of that year, the surplus grain from the bumper harvest of 1932 could be transported out of the province in a relaxed manner. If we compare the amount of rice exported to other provinces by these four provinces in 1932 with that in 1933, it will be clearer.</p>
<p>The national rice production in 1932 was 969,080,000 piculs, accounting for 98.5% of the national rice production in 1933. The harvest was also considerable. However, since the new grain market season was already in the last quarter of 1932, it was impossible to transport all of it to other provinces due to time constraints. Moreover, at this time, the rice in various provinces was in a season of supply exceeding demand, so there was no market for importing rice from other provinces. Therefore, although the stored grain was abundant, it could only be left for the following year (i.e., 1933) to be exported out of the province. Therefore, the amount of rice exported from the province in 1933 actually accounted for the total amount of one and a half years. From this point of view, is this year's bumper harvest a result of inheriting the surplus from last year's bumper harvest? If last year's harvest was not as bountiful as that of 1932, then the surplus of rice in these four provinces this year may not be as good as that of 1933.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of self-sufficient provinces, Jiangsu, Hebei, Hubei, and Guangxi had mixed domestic trade inflows and outflows amid the bumper harvest in 1933. Although Jiangsu is a rice-producing area, its population density is higher than that of other provinces in recent years. According to experts' estimates, it can only be self-sufficient. Even in a bumper harvest, the export is not much. Hebei, Hubei, and Guangxi are not very important rice-producing provinces, but there may be no problem in self-sufficiency. As for Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Yunnan, they are all rice-deficient provinces. Moreover, the Southwest is a low-tax area for foreign rice, so a large amount of foreign rice is imported every year. The above provinces' situations are all obtained after the analysis of the bumper harvest in 1933. As for their situation this year, it is difficult to say for sure at one time. However, in general, rice can definitely be surplus in surplus provinces, but rice can hardly be self-sufficient and have a surplus in deficit provinces. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>(IV) Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, when it comes to so-called bumper harvests in our country throughout history, people often mistakenly believe that there is an opportunity for rice self-sufficiency. Actually, this is a big mistake. For China to truly achieve self-sufficiency in rice, it must first adjust production technology and expand the cultivated area. The reason for low grain prices harming farmers is entirely due to the temporary phenomenon of supply exceeding demand during the new grain market season. From an economic point of view, this is not unreasonable. Tang Wenkai believed that low grain prices can harm farmers and benefit farmers. The crux of the matter is whether farmers have a surplus to exchange for usable goods after paying all production costs during low grain prices. If there is a sufficient surplus to compensate for all the necessary material equipment, then low grain prices are not harmful. Therefore, he advocated increasing agricultural output and reducing burdens. However, due to the large scale of the matter, it was difficult to find support. In order to solve this year's bumper harvest problem, we will temporarily start with a symptomatic treatment and balance the supply and demand of new grain. In other words, we will start promoting "simple farmers' associations" in rice-surplus provinces, and control transportation and sales in rice self-sufficient and rice-deficit provinces.</p>
<p>The method of storing grain to relieve famine has been practiced in China for a long time. However, due to the corruption and embezzlement by local bullies after the decline of warehouse administration in the late Qing Dynasty, the private warehousing industry gradually declined. In 1928, the Executive Yuan drafted warehousing measures, stipulating that the national warehouse grades should be (1) National Reserve Warehouse; (2) Provincial Reserve Warehouse; (3) County Warehouse; (4) District Warehouse; (5) Township Warehouse, and other five categories. However, due to various reasons, it was not fully realized. The author believes that the warehousing industry should be vigorously promoted. However, in the abnormal environment of this time and place, we must also consider it. Therefore, it is advocated that the establishment of national warehouses, provincial warehouses, and county warehouses be continued for those that have already been established, and those that have not yet been established should be postponed. This type of warehouse mostly adopts a large-scale centralized storage system for grain, and the safety issue is worth considering. In the event of an emergency, this huge amount of stored grain will inevitably be bombed! Therefore, the highest principles for running the warehousing business at present should be "simplicity," "universality," and "distributed storage." Moreover, in terms of the current actual people's strength, these three are also easier to implement. As for the method of popularizing this simple agricultural warehouse, in addition to using old warehousing funds and local public funds, we should also use the surrounding economic environment, such as cooperatives, railways, highways, and postal savings bureaus. Because these entities have production relations with rice, or transportation and sales relations, or financial lending relations, they can all use their spare capacity to assist farmers in popularizing the establishment of agricultural warehouses.</p>
<p>Regarding the location of simple agricultural warehouses, in this year's bumper harvest problem, rice-surplus provinces should be the center, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, which should be given serious attention. Because if farmers in these surplus provinces can keep their own grain and not dump it to other provinces unsystematically, the grain prices in self-sufficient provinces can be greatly reduced during the new grain market season, and grain prices will not fall drastically. In grain-deficient provinces, the provincial government authorities should manage the unified transportation and sales, and consider the shortage in the province as the standard for adding foreign rice. In short, the central work in rice-surplus provinces is to popularize simple agricultural warehouses. In rice-deficient provinces, the central work is to control transportation and sales. In self-sufficient provinces, the government manages the buying and selling of rice. The whole country is united and cooperates. Then this year's bumper harvest problem can be safely transitioned.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market Last Week Was Very Calm</h3>
<p>Last week (September 14 to 19) at the Chinese Securities Exchange, although there were many environmental changes, the public bond market was unexpectedly calm, unaffected by any incidents, hovering sluggishly, and remaining smooth sailing throughout. The fundamental reason is that most speculators have left, and the number of bonds held in accounts has decreased daily. Like a shallow stream, even if the wind blows, there are no waves, so the situation is almost back to the primitive era. There is still no hope of activity in the future. Although the settlement date is approaching, trading may increase slightly, but the market price is still not easy to change dramatically. Looking back on the past week, Monday and Tuesday were affected by the North Sea incident, with a slight decrease of 2 jiao (unit of currency) each day. Wednesday and Thursday were affected by swap transactions, with an increase of 3-4 jiao. Friday was extremely sluggish, with most boards up 1-2 jiao. On Saturday, there was the Fengtai incident, the market was firm and slightly frustrated, with a slight decrease of about 1 jiao. The environment and the bond market are running in opposite directions, and it is not easy to break this dull situation at present. The result of the week's market price was a slight decrease of 1-3 jiao, and the forward price of Class A bonds also decreased by 1.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 27,810,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared in the table below. (Unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: American New Cotton Sales Are Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of American cotton fell by 3-5 points (unit of weight) in each month. In the early morning, due to overnight arbitrage and the closing of positions by bullish brokers, the market was sluggish. However, traders bought in at falling prices, and Liverpool and the Far East bought in. Speculators bought at limit prices, showing a slight rebound. Cotton merchants were waiting for the weekend weather report. The weather in the East and Midwest was good, and new cotton was moving smoothly. There was scattered rain in the West, which benefited cotton harvesting. According to the Dallas report, the rainfall in Texas was too late. The closing price was weak, with spot prices falling by 13 points and futures prices falling by 8-13 points. The spot price of English cotton fell by 3 points, and the futures price fell by 1-2 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 19th) American cotton is worth the legal currency compared to the previous day. English cotton is worth the legal currency compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening price forecast for the 21st is that White Wiki will be 218.5 rupees, down 2.5 rupees; Oomra will be 195.5 rupees, down 2.25 rupees; Pingal will be 155 rupees, down 1.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Grain: Bian Yuan Rose Alone by 1-2 Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, about 10 boats of goods arrived from various sources, totaling more than 4,000 dan. The market in this street was still calm. The Qingdao gang handled more than 400 packages, so the market situation was flat. Thick and thin japonica rice prices were all the same. The Eastern New was easier to sell and fell by 1 jiao. The price of the factory-made new was stable. New Yangjian sales were slower and the situation was weak. The price of Bian Yuan rose slightly.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 34-35 boats of goods arrived from various river wharves. Various goods in the market were sold. There were some transactions in broken japonica rice and various indica rice. Eastern and Western new japonica rice sales slowed down, but Bian Yuan was still active. The market price of broken japonica rice was high, ordinary materials were flat and weak, and the price was down by several points to nearly 1 jiao. The price of Western new japonica rice was down by 1-2 jiao, and the price of Eastern new japonica rice and thin rice was down by about 1 jiao. The price of new Yangtuan early indica rice was flat and weak. The arrival of new guest pointed rice was very rare, and sales were still good. The price was strong, and Bian Qian Yuan rose by 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Differences in Quality and Durability of New Dried Cuttlefish and Squid</h3>
<p>New Dried Cuttlefish:</p>
<p>It has been observed that the amount of cuttlefish caught in the first ten-day fishing season was quite substantial, but catches during the second and third ten-day periods, as well as subsequent catches, have sharply declined. This was truly unexpected by those in the industry. The mountain merchants at the production sites, seeing that the later catches were not plentiful, are mostly eager to sell quickly. Those with capital are actively collecting and monopolizing the supply locally, waiting for better prices. Dealers in this city, due to the limited arrival of new goods, have had to supply the market with old stock. However, the old stock is now nearly sold out, and the source of new goods remains scarce. Therefore, market conditions are becoming increasingly tight. Yesterday, a dealer offered a batch of top-quality new goods at thirty-six yuan, which is two yuan higher than the market price last week. Moreover, because dealers have limited stock, many are unwilling to sell. Thus, there is a possibility that the market will continue to rise.</p>
<p>New Squid:</p>
<p>Hot water squid has not been dispatched, but unexpectedly, autumn water ocean-caught squid is thriving, with shipments gradually pouring in recently, and prices are also gradually decreasing. Yesterday, the market offered large slices of high-quality Xiangguan squid at eighty-one yuan and nine jiao, common quality at eighty yuan, small peach squid at eighty yuan, and flower oil slices at seventy-eight yuan and five jiao. Confidence among traders is declining, and because wholesale sales to various regions have not been significant, the market is expected to trend downward.</p>

<h3>Principles of Antibiotic Treatment for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Graduate of Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatory treatments can only alleviate inflammatory symptoms in localized lesions. Antibiotics directly target tissue infiltration and pus. The sole requirement for gonorrhea treatment and three conditions!</p>
<p>Measures for treating gonorrhea have undergone a major transformation in recent years, which is a sensational event throughout the treatment community. Previously, membrane sterilization therapy was prevalent for gonorrhea, but because it was a localized treatment, it has proven ineffective. Its therapeutic value has long been negated by medical professionals, who unanimously demanded "a new therapy."</p>
<p>Following localized sterilization therapy, the theory of antibiotic antibodies emerged. This aims to stimulate the "natural healing power" within gonorrhea patients, combating the venereal toxins in the urethra and various tissues of the body. The animal body inherently possesses a bacterial ingestion function, known as "natural healing power." However, to enhance this disease-preventing and bacterial-ingesting function, the use of protein is essential. Professor Hansen first proposed this theory, and Dr. Shagnhufer and Dr. U. Horwitz further refined it, stating that using pure pigments in combination is more effective. Dr. Biedel, an international scholar from their school, created a drug called "Kelinong."</p>
<p>Ordinary anti-inflammatory agents can only alleviate inflammatory symptoms around localized lesions and cannot prevent the proliferation of urethral epithelial cells. "Kelinong," with its special efficacy, can rapidly eliminate inflammation in epithelial cells, deep layers of the mucous membrane, urethral glands, excretory ducts, etc. Secondly, it can increase the number and bacterial ingestion power of white blood cells, engulfing joint inflammation deep within the body. Thirdly, it provides cells with substantial functional enhancement, allowing the necrosis and purulent tissue in the inflammatory area to quickly return to normal! Therefore, acute urethritis, chronic prostatitis, orchitis, etc., in men, as well as vulvitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, metritis, leukorrhea, etc., in women, can be radically cured by taking Kelinong for one to two months, eliminating the risk of recurrence! However, for leukorrhea in women, it is advisable to use "Ka'er Xuedi No. 1" suppositories externally as well.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang Jingsheng's Philosophy of Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Based on Mencius's saying, "Food and sex are human nature," he established the two major principles of life: sexology and "culinary scripture"!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Mr. Zhang Jingsheng is a Doctor of Philosophy, but also knows that he is a sexology expert. Although his views have been criticized as obscene, from the perspectives of physiology, medicine, philosophy, and sociology, isn't human life and the origin of culture built upon the two words "food" and "sex"? Mencius said, "Food and sex are human nature," indicating that this is an innate human instinct. Therefore, how to satisfy a couple's regular life and how to enhance appetite are two urgent problems to be solved. The latter is especially necessary for people with stomach ailments. Because stomach problems cause nausea, belching, acid reflux, noisy stomach, fullness and pain after eating, which is extremely painful. According to my clinical experience, the German drug "Qiang Wei Jing" (Strong Stomach Essence) is indeed effective in treating the aforementioned stomach ailments. Taking about three to four bottles to seven or eight bottles can completely cure it. In addition, bad breath, thick saliva, indigestion with constipation, excessive gas, and diarrhea with abdominal pain can also be completely cured by taking "Qiang Wei Jing." It has strong and gentle tonic effects and is effective for treating post-illness and weak stomachs!</p>
<h3>How to Overcome Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jin Yueren</p>
<p>Not overcoming it becomes the root of all diseases.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is the most prevalent disease among our female compatriots. Because it is so common, it is often regarded as a secret ailment, and not enough attention is paid to treatment. Thus, a hidden danger is planted unknowingly. Because any moist area with mucous membranes on our bodies is most susceptible to attracting bacteria. We often see many women suffering from leukorrhea who suddenly experience bleeding in their lower abdomen, which is all due to the attack of bacteria and the lack of treatment. Alternatively, if they are fortunate enough to avoid bleeding, their vaginas become eroded, their lower abdomen swells and aches, and their vulvas become inflamed and swollen due to prolonged erosion. As a result, they experience great pain during intercourse and urination. Many women with irregular menstruation also have their roots in leukorrhea.</p>
<p>Based on our daily clinical experience, although leukorrhea can be dangerous, it can be naturally cured with antiseptic, analgesic, and anti-secretory suppositories. "Ka'er Xuedi's Vaginal Tablets" have the same effects as the aforementioned conditions for treating leukorrhea. Therefore, "Ka'er's Vaginal Tablets" are the authority in leukorrhea medication and can cure both old and new cases of leukorrhea. However, if it was caused by menstrual disorders in the past, or if leukorrhea came first followed by irregular menstruation, "Ka'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories, and "Bu Nü Rong" (Nourishing Women's Complexion) can be taken to regulate menstruation. If it is caused by a husband's gonorrhea, "Kelinong" can also be taken to eliminate gonorrhea, so the effect will definitely be very quick.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>The consequences of gonorrheal vasitis.</p>
<p>The vas deferens is the reproductive organ responsible for transporting semen. Its position is very important. If a patient suffers from gonorrheal orchitis and does not receive thorough treatment, the gonorrhea bacteria will further invade and cause vasitis. If this is not treated, the tube will become blocked due to inflammation, and it will not be able to fulfill its transport function, becoming the main cause of infertility. Fortunately, if it is not blocked, and contact with the opposite sex occurs, the semen and gonorrhea bacteria are injected into the vagina at the same time, causing very severe vaginal gonorrhea or uterine gonorrhea, posing a major threat to reproduction.</p>
<p>Therefore, internal and external treatment is necessary for this condition. If this treatment is not followed, there will be the pain of attending to one thing while losing sight of another. There was a patient, Mr. Pei Xianjun, from Changsha, who had been doing business in Shanghai for many years. He currently lives in a certain lane on Haige Road. He has suffered from gonorrhea for three or four years, and although he has been treated continuously, his disease has not been cured. He subsequently developed orchitis, which became chronic, so he did not pay much attention to it. A friend introduced him to my clinic for treatment. It was found that there were thick, swollen vessels between his penis and testicles, which were inflamed and painful, and blood followed after urination. It had become a combined epididymitis and vasitis. In addition to anti-gonorrhea serum and electrical treatment, he was also instructed to take the German "Kelinong" to increase the antitoxins in his body and achieve bactericidal, gonorrhea-eliminating, and pain-relieving effects. Before long, the inflammation and swelling subsided, returning to normal, and the testicles and vas deferens returned to their original healthy state. However, his wife also suffered from severe gonorrheal leukorrhea, with pus flowing profusely and local erosion, which hindered urination and also induced irregular menstruation and many years of infertility. She was instructed to take "Kelinong" internally to eliminate gonorrhea and use "Ka's Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories to clear the leukorrhea. After four weeks, the gonorrhea was cleared, the leukorrhea was gone, and the lesions had returned to normal. Later, "Bu Nü Rong" was used to regulate her menstruation. One month later, menstruation arrived on time. They have been living together ever since and now have two children.</p>
<h3>The Link of Love</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>What is the steering wheel of love?</p>
<p>Can love still be sustained if this link is lost?</p>
<p>Pay attention to the loss of love's link!</p>
<p>To be honest, love between the sexes is based on sexual desire. If even the sexuality of a child has not yet sprouted, or an elderly person whose sex glands have completely disappeared, they have nothing to discuss about love. Even if an elderly person is in love, if his or her sex glands still exist, it still feels that way.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that love between the sexes is built upon sexual desire, the link of love is sexual desire. However, there are many young men and women whose development is not yet complete who masturbate, marry early, and excessively abuse their sex glands. This is like a flower bud that is about to bloom but is suddenly struck by wind and rain. Can we still expect to see a beautiful and dazzling flower bloom? Of course not.</p>
<p>Therefore, young people who masturbate and are excessively indulgent in sexual desire have sex glands that are mostly underdeveloped. Moreover, their sexual nerves are weakened as a result, leading to symptoms such as incomplete reproductive development, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and weak penile erection. Symptoms such as head congestion, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, anemia, and decreased appetite are also derived from these symptoms. Can this still sustain love between the sexes? Moreover, it is difficult to develop our careers as a result. In order to enhance human happiness and restore love between the sexes, we must use appropriate and effective measures. After graduating from the Russian Labor University Medical School for five years, I often studied various schools of thought during my internship at the Moscow Hospital. Based on the experiments of Dr. Kesilafu and Dr. Nuo, it is most effective to use Meren's "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Tonic) for young people with sexual neurasthenia and incomplete development. Because "Bu Ti Kang" is made from the hormones of brave and strong animals using scientific methods. Therefore, after taking it, it can replenish the large amount of hormones lost due to masturbation or excessive intercourse, promote growth and development, and strengthen the tissues of the reproductive system. Therefore, it can eliminate various neurasthenic disorders and restore a healthy life between the sexes. This is a special medicine that has been successfully tested by millions of people. Therefore, "Bu Ti Kang" is unmatched by any endocrine preparation. Therefore, "Bu Ti Kang" is also praised as the link of love between the sexes. However, those who take it must pay attention to the fact that in addition to taking this medicine continuously, they must abstain from the bad habit of masturbation, and intercourse should also be moderate. Then, the effectiveness of this medicine will be even greater.</p>
<h3>Why Are Women Prone to Anger?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>It is a sign of neurasthenia, with menstrual irregularities being the biggest cause. Husbands must pay attention to this!</p>
<p>Sensitivity and emotionality have long been considered the characteristics of women, and women are therefore pitied by the opposite sex. However, times have changed, and this kind of Lin Daiyu-style morbid beauty is long outdated. However, healthy and beautiful women are rare, and all that one sees and hears are these sick women. According to our clinical experience, patients are absent-minded, and even a slight setback can cause them to become upset and angry, with headaches, head heaviness, and feeling like their heads are in a hoop all day long. They experience palpitations, cannot sleep at night, are thin, and have a sallow complexion or a dull and lifeless appearance, indicating anemia, with leukorrhea. The cause is actually due to menstrual irregularities. However, patients often become irritated and angry, leading to discord in the marital relationship, which further worsens the illness, and even leads to divorce. Therefore, female neurasthenia and menstrual irregularities have a great impact on a woman's lifelong happiness.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this condition, it must be resolved from the root. According to the research of medical professionals in Europe and the United States, it is essential to first regulate endocrine functions. When ovarian functions, etc., are abnormal, it can often lead to menstrual irregularities and amenorrhea. This further triggers neurasthenia and the aforementioned symptoms. The German drug "Bu Nü Rong" (Nourishing Women's Complexion) has a special and good effect on regulating ovarian function. It can also strengthen the nerves and calm the nerves, so it can be effective in five or six weeks after taking it. It can also regulate menstruation and make it easier to conceive, and it can also make the mind clear, the body and mind happy, the spirit lively, and increase fat, so as to achieve a moderate level of obesity. Therefore, the muscles are delicate and the complexion is rosy and beautiful. It is a fundamental beauty method. However, for those with leukorrhea, "Ka's Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to eliminate leukorrhea, making the treatment more thorough and complete.</p>
<h3>Why is Masturbation So Prevalent?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of Army Medical University</p>
<p>The main treatment for spermatorrhea is not to block the vas deferens. Calming the nerves is not an explanation for reducing sexual desire.</p>
<p>Masturbation can be said to be a social disease because its cause is linked to the economy. Because the standard of living has risen recently, the marriage problem is extremely difficult to solve. Even going to a prostitute requires a temporary expense, so most young people who have reached the peak of sexual arousal often turn to the demonic path of masturbation. Some people think that occasional fun is not important; who knows that once you are infected, it becomes a bad habit that is difficult to quit.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia and spermatorrhea come with masturbation. Once spermatorrhea occurs frequently, the vas deferens loses its toughness and no longer has the ability to control semen. Therefore, the method of treating spermatorrhea is to enhance the control and toughness of the vas deferens. The manifestation of toughness is the spasm during ejaculation, which can increase the pleasure of the couple. And if the control force is strong, spermatorrhea will no longer occur. "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" can relieve the relaxation of the vas deferens caused by spermatorrhea and can strengthen the spasm force and increase pleasure, so it is different from the common method of stopping spermatorrhea by blocking the vas deferens. Moreover, this medicine can calm the nerves and prevent the color from flowing immediately. (Calming the nerves is not reducing sexual desire, but avoiding false excitement.) Therefore, "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" can treat all symptoms of spermatorrhea. Leaks, spills, etc., even those who experience spermatorrhea five or six times a week, can be completely cured by taking three or four bottles. It is best to take "Bu Ti Kang" at the same time to restore the weakness after curing spermatorrhea, so the effect will be even greater!</p>
<p>A Study of Excerpts from The Golden Lotus</p>
<h3>How Did Li Ping'er Die of Tuberculosis?</h3>
<p>— Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, Dr. Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Burning with jealousy, Ximen Qing should not have taken a concubine!</p>
<p>What is the relationship between melancholy and the development of pulmonary tuberculosis? "One Hundred Questions About Tuberculosis" - Questions 9-10</p>
<p>Dr. Deng's Clinic: Corner of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road Clinic Hours: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>The book "The Golden Lotus" was originally a banned book. Now, the moralists say it is an obscene book and have revised it and deleted many parts. Although its essence has gradually disappeared, there are still many places that are worthy of study by physiologists, pathologists, and psychologists. What we want to talk about at the moment is the problem of Li Ping'er's lung disease.</p>
<p>Li Ping'er was originally a beloved concubine of Ximen Qing. After Ximen Qing took Pan Jinlian as the third wife, she lost her love. As most people say: anger and sadness killed Li Ping'er!</p>
<p>How does mental unhappiness cause Li Ping'er to get tuberculosis! From a medical point of view: the human body is infected with tuberculosis due to drastic changes in the environment (negative aspects) and sharp depletion of physical strength. Excessive mental effort, extreme labor, and excessive grief and anger can all lead to the reproduction of tubercle bacillus and reduce resistance. According to this. To treat lung disease, the first thing to do is to increase resistance, and the second is to eliminate tubercle bacilli. The elimination of tubercle bacilli lies in increasing the calcareousness of the lesion, especially reducing the intra-pulmonary oxygen that is sufficient to multiply tubercle bacilli!! The only preparation that has this effect is "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic). This medicine is truly an excellent remedy for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, hemoptysis, cough, and chest pain, and it has no drawbacks. If pulmonary tuberculosis is accompanied by neurasthenia, insomnia, headache, waist pain, forgetfulness, etc., in addition to taking "Bu Fei Na Er", you can also take "Bu Ti Kang" for men or "Bu Nü Rong" for women to increase the body's resistance. "Bu Nü Rong" can also regulate women's menstrual cycles and tonify the blood and warm the womb. If there is physical weakness and leukorrhea, "Ka'er Xuedi" can be used externally as a vaginal suppository. As for men with premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, etc., you can also take "Bu Ti Kang" to tonify the kidneys and "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" to treat spermatorrhea. However, "Bu Fei Na Er" also has the effect of treating tidal fever and night sweats.</p>
<h3>How to Shorten the Pain of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>Early treatment for gonorrhea equals early release from prison;</p>
<p>...but you must not be impatient for success, you must take proper measures...</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Shutian, a patient, went home drunk after socializing at a friend's house last month. It was late at night, and he was lured by a prostitute. Only five days after returning, he felt a stinging pain in his urethra, and urination was like drilling and piercing. Soon, pus flowed out. The glans and foreskin were inflamed and swollen due to the irritation of gonorrhea. Fortunately, Mr. Yu had some medical knowledge and heard that I have some experience in the treatment of gonorrhea. Therefore, on the third day after the onset of the disease, he asked me for treatment. I used Caram's staining method to examine the secretions that were gradually coming out under a microscope. There were countless gonorrhea bacteria mixed in the multinuclear white blood cells. (As shown in the first picture) This is acute urethritis. Fortunately, the gonorrhea is still in the anterior urethra, and it is not difficult to completely eradicate it. After cleaning his urethral pus, I immediately prescribed "Kelinong" to promote diuresis, reduce inflammation, and kill bacteria, so that gonorrhea bacteria had no foothold to avoid counterattacks. After taking it continuously for three weeks, the inflammation and swelling of the glans and foreskin disappeared, and urination was completely free, no different from usual. His urine was also clear and free of gonorrhea. However, I was still afraid that it was not completely cured. The gonorrhea bacteria in Mr. Yu's first morning urine were completely gone, but Mr. Yu was physically weak and his urine contained some spermatozoa (see the second picture), so he was instructed to take "Bu Ti Kang" for a week and he was also completely cured. This is to quickly treat gonorrhea to shorten the painful period. Otherwise, various complications will occur, and it will become spermatorrhea. Because "Bu Ti Kang" is most suitable for recovery after gonorrhea.</p>

<h3>Protecting the Lungs Equals Increasing the Source of Life</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>Autumn dryness is in command, and the lungs are in trouble - this is an old saying. Quickly eliminate phlegm and cough to avoid chronic coughs, internal injuries, and all respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>We don't need to use theory to explain the importance of the lungs. Just look at a person who coughs all night, and the next day he feels exhausted and speechless, which can prove that the lungs are overworked, which is more difficult than mountain climbing and racing.</p>
<p>Therefore, protecting the lungs is equivalent to taking care of physical strength, which is also tantamount to increasing the source of life. Now, autumn dryness is in command. The old saying is that this is a season that is not suitable for the lungs. In fact, the autumn weather is often cold and warm, and it is easy to catch a cold and cough. Coughing is inherently difficult to treat. If ignored, or if you choose medicine carelessly, it often leads to chronic cough, which slowly turns into internal injury, tuberculosis, which is extremely dangerous! The best medicine can treat cough and prevent tuberculosis, with both being taken care of. The only medicine that has such a great effect is "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic). "Bu Fei Na Er" is not only good at eliminating phlegm and radically curing coughs, but also has special and miraculous effects on children's whooping cough, elderly people's phlegm and asthma, and all other respiratory diseases. You will know this after taking it.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Anecdotes: Autumn Feelings</h3>
<p>— Zhou Guochang</p>
<p>The rustling autumn wind blows the leaves on the trees, one by one, causing the velvety grass to tremble and change color. A flock of wild geese soar in the sky, making a clear and mournful sound, which is transmitted into my eardrums, instantly adding to my infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>Summer goes and autumn arrives, which is originally a natural phenomenon in a year, but time passes so quickly that time has passed and circumstances have changed in an instant. See how creatures grow vigorously in spring and summer, but gradually wither and turn yellow in autumn. Just like a person's life, when he is young and promising, he does not engage in serious business, and wastes his precious time in vain; once his hair turns white and many wrinkles appear on his face, although he wants to make progress, his spirit declines, and he finally achieves nothing. Thinking of the past, he regrets it too late and can only sigh.</p>
<p>I hope that we young people, when we are young and strong, work hard for your future and do not waste precious time, lest we feel the sorrow of being old and sad.</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Autumn</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Of the four seasons, I believe it is not spring that is most worth cherishing, but autumn. The reason is that spring is tiresome. The vexations of life often creep into the human world along with the tiresome spring. Only when the autumn wind rises are these vexations swept away along with the falling leaves. Thus, what we feel in autumn is a sense of ease and inexplicable comfort.</p>
<p>Human vision needs adjustment. Therefore, in winter, we have the boundless white snow covering the universe, giving us the pleasure of a change of environment. In spring and summer, what we see are nothing but green branches and leaves, purple pistils and red flowers. After being surrounded by red flowers and green leaves for two long seasons, we enter a scene of yellow leaves and bare branches in autumn. Although sensitive poets cannot help but feel sentimental about their own lives, I believe this is precisely the adjustment of vision that nature gives us, and it can also be said to be an intimation that we must seek adjustment in life.</p>
<p>Superficially speaking, autumn can also be said to be an unpretentious season. It does not require the coolness needed in summer, nor the artificial warmth needed in winter. In autumn, the flow of blood in the human body is not as rapid as in spring. The function of growth gradually enters a state of stillness, but it is not as dry and lacking in vitality as in winter. Therefore, autumn is a model of frugality without stinginess.</p>
<p>If our praise for spring is for a plump beauty, then for autumn, we should say it is for a lean old man. The mountains have faded in color, but are not yet bare. The trees have lost their shady green leaves, but have not yet revealed their dry branches. On the earth, although there is no longer the chirping of orioles, the chirping of crickets and the long cries of solitary geese, one or two at a time, decorate the scene without the desolation of winter. Therefore, autumn is a lean old man, whose spirit is still so vigorous, not at all like winter, which shows such decrepitude.</p>
<p>But when the autumn wind rises, wealthy families are busy preparing to eat crabs and admire chrysanthemums, while the poor, with only a worn-out padded jacket and trousers, and only an old cotton quilt, are still keeping them in pawnshops, unable to redeem them, and are worrying about it. In large shops, banners of autumn sales flutter in the wind, and under the neon lights in the large windows, the smiling faces of expensive goods seem to shine constantly, while the poor can only bite their lower lips, staring blankly at these things, watching the gentlemen and ladies drive away fully loaded. – Perhaps this still indicates that autumn is quite snobbish?</p>
<h3>Autumn Clouds</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Autumn clouds are full of flavor. Since I was a child, I have had an inextricable bond with my home. Later, when I entered society, I was fortunate enough to work in the countryside where I could see the sun. Therefore, "autumn clouds" gave me a deep understanding. Whenever there was a quiet morning glow, or a dusk "sending off the setting sun in the sound of oars," I would always walk alone to the suburbs to appreciate it for a while. If it rained, although I stopped my usual lessons, I couldn't help but feel as unhappy as if I had lost a beloved thing!</p>
<p>Because autumn clouds are so lovely, they change at any time and in countless ways on the vast sky. It would be most appropriate to describe them as magicians.</p>
<p>The best places to see autumn clouds in my hometown are Mount Qiyun and Mount Huang. It is said that because the mountains are high, when you reach the top, the clouds are already in front of your eyes. Not to mention seeing them, it is easy to catch them with your hands. But unfortunately, I have never tried it, and I dare not fully introduce what it tastes like.</p>
<p>People often use autumn clouds to compare human relationships, but today's human relationships are simply not as good as autumn clouds! Reading Xu Jialin's letter to Lu Jianzhi in "Qiu Shui Xuan Chi Du," he said: "As a brother, I call on Jiang Bo every day to ask for help; I never thought that human affairs are like autumn clouds, and human feelings are like flowing water. In ordinary times, we value friendship and keep our promises; but when it comes to money, they turn their backs on me as if they don't know me. Since I asked for help, I have knocked on their doors almost ten times, but nine times they have not opened." Although it is not entirely using "autumn clouds" as a metaphor, the human relationships of that time have been fully expressed. If Xu Gong were still alive today, I really don't know what kind of clouds he would use to curse the state of the world?</p>
<p>Although I like to appreciate autumn clouds, I can't help but take a cold breath after reading Xu Gong's letter.</p>
<h3>An Unlonely Autumn</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>"The weather is cool but not cold" is a phrase unique to autumn. Because in autumn, there is no terrible heat like in summer, nor terrible cold like in winter, so autumn can be said to be the most lovely season of the year. Moreover, there is a common saying, "Spring blooms, autumn fruits." Indeed, the cotton for clothing and the millet for food are all harvested in this autumn, rewarding the farmers for their hard work throughout the year, and enriching the necessities of life for those with round heads and square feet to keep out the cold. Therefore, autumn can also be said to be our golden season.</p>
<p>In autumn, our lives can be said to be quite unlonely. "The weather is cool but not cold" is a good season for travel. Whether it is on the mountain or by the water, there is a unique and refreshing scene in the clear autumn light. The raging waves and the faint white clouds are all good material for the traveler's camera. The scarlet maple leaves are even better subjects for the traveler to compose poems. Therefore, the activity of travel groups in various places during this season is naturally expected. And the large number of travelers traveling to various places may be of some help to the rural economy that is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In the autumn garden, one will not feel lonely because of the withering of all kinds of flowers. You only need to plant a few autumn chrysanthemums, which have always had the style of noble scholars, in the courtyard or by the fence. Then you can be sure that in the atmosphere of cold dew and frost, you will not have to worry about the lack of colorful flowers to please the eye. In terms of eating, the "unintestined gentleman," the crab, becomes fat and plump day by day, crawling across the fishermen's huts in the autumn wind, and is placed on plates for us to enjoy. In terms of playing, the cricket, which has the title of "general," constantly emits tempting chirping sounds in front of the steps and under the walls, waiting for people to catch and play with.</p>
<p>At the same time, in this autumn season, we have the Mid-Autumn Festival with its full moon, and the Double Ninth Festival for ascending to high places to avoid vulgarity. After being busy with this, we are busy with that. The short autumn light will surely slip away easily. Even to say something unambitious, even if one is suffering from poverty and illness, living a life away from home, lying in bed with a quilt, with only the stove and a lamp as companions, there are still the roaring autumn wind and the autumn rain knocking on the window, very diligently accompanying you to relieve your loneliness away from home.</p>
<p>It is really too lovely – our unlonely autumn.</p>
<h3>Changing Autumn Clouds</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Huan Chao Luan Feng (Phoenixes Re-nesting)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: The Iron Face Sees Affectionate Words, The Parrot Hears The Deceit, The Beautiful Eyebrows Keep A Spirit of Chivalry, And The Pawnshop Asks About The Kunlun Slave</p>
<p>Menglan snatched the pen from her hand and threw it into the porcelain pen holder, causing a clanging sound. She laughed and said, "You don't need to play these tricks. Could a young lady use the words 'Kunlun slave' in her writing?" Youmei smiled and said, "Well, guess what I mean." Menglan shook her head and said, "I can't guess." Youmei said, "Honestly, I'll ask you. Would someone like me be qualified to volunteer to be a Kunlun slave for someone?" Menglan laughed and said, "I'm not a teacher, why are you asking me this?" Youmei said, "You're too cunning, I'm asking you nicely, but you're dodging me. Aren't you being too insincere with me?" As she said this, Youmei's face darkened. Menglan tapped her cheek with a forefinger and laughed, "You're still putting on airs in front of me." Youmei said, "I'm not putting on airs. Since you know my feelings, whether you're willing or not, why don't you give me an answer? Don't think that I'm a girl and there's nothing I can do. I think we have to fight for freedom, even if it means bloodshed." Even someone like the yellow-shirted Kunlun slave isn't that great, just a bit chivalrous. Do you think I don't have any chivalry?" As she spoke, she stood up and puffed out her chest. Just looking at her furrowed brows and rosy cheeks, she had an air of chivalry. Menglan laughed and said, "Okay, let's say you're a chivalrous person. Sit down, and I'll tell you about the story of the Kunlun slave. Isn't it a story from the Tang Dynasty? It says that a man named Cui went to see a nobleman who was sick. The nobleman ordered a singer named Hongxiao to serve him. The doctor fell in love with her and became ill. The Kunlun slave carried him into the nobleman's mansion to meet Hongxiao, and later carried them both out. Isn't that the gist of it? Your analogy is not very accurate at all. I don't want to be compared to Hongxiao, and you shouldn't compare yourself to a slave." Youmei said, "Medicine doesn't distinguish between high and low, as long as the things are generally similar. Now that you can't be compared to Hongxiao, and I can't be compared to a Kunlun slave, I'll ask you a very presumptuous question. Whether it's right or wrong, you can't get angry. This is just a hypothetical situation. In this universe, is there someone like Cui, the young man?" A blush appeared on Menglan's cheeks. Youmei pointed at her with a forefinger and laughed, "I warned you beforehand, don't get angry." Menglan forced a smile and said, "Don't you know my background? I ask you as a good friend, and I often tell you my feelings. But I believe I have kept myself pure and have never done anything immoral." (76)</p>
<h3>The Wonton Seller</h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>"Doo-doo-doo."</p>
<p>The wonton seller is like a clock. When people have worked all day and are about to rest, he comes along smiling and says, "You've worked hard all day, come and eat wontons." If you don't have any money with you, he will say to you, "Old customer, I'll give you a bowl on credit." He does business so politely, which earns him a lot of goodwill from the customers.</p>
<p>He is only a young man in his twenties this year. A few years ago, he escaped from Shenyang to Shanghai with his father, who was in his fifties, under the hail of bullets. He doesn't gamble, drink, or visit prostitutes, but he has a special hobby – reading. He often puts books like "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber" on his wonton stand. He tells me that he borrowed them by going to the library entrance. He said, "Besides supporting my old father, I use the rest of the money I earn to buy books."</p>
<p>He studied at a middle school in Shenyang for a year and a half. People asked him why he didn't become a primary school teacher to make a comfortable living. He replied, "Doesn't 'Education of Love' say that a shoemaker who can make good shoes is better than an incompetent university professor or an incompetent lawyer?"</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, he was walking hurriedly with two prescriptions in his hand, his face covered with sorrow. That amiable smile that he usually had was nowhere to be seen. People said that his father had suddenly contracted the plague and his condition was very serious. As a result, the son was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot.</p>
<p>Two weeks have passed, and I haven't seen the wonton seller's shadow. My heart seems to feel a strange loneliness. Here, I sincerely wish them peace and well-being!</p>
<h3>Water Red Water Caltrop</h3>
<p>— (Lake Beggar)</p>
<p>When the autumn wind rises, the water caltrop turns purple. They are recommended to the market during the season, accounting for a large proportion of the rural aquatic income. There are many low-lying ponds in Jiangnan. Besides farming, people regard this as a source of profit. Therefore, clear streams around the houses and ponds all over the fields are full of green leaves, supplementing the autumn harvest. The water caltrop produced in Xiang Lake is known together with water shield and lotus root, which goes without saying. Even in the various counties of Kuaiji, the floating ports and rivers are of unknown numbers of thousands of acres. By the end of summer, green surrounds all sides, making people feel that the water country scenery has a special charm. When the繁花白了 (unsure of meaning), a red corner emerges. Harvesting boats float out like ducklings, with long poles and short skirts, mostly women in charge. They sing impromptu songs without accompaniment, which are more interesting than the mountain tea songs in the wilderness. In autumn, there are many red reeds on the beach. When someone asks if there are those who insert them into their black hair to compete with the beauty of the reeds, the women laugh and scold together. When the pole tilts and the boat lists, water splashes on their skirts, they are in great commotion. At this time, the autumn sun is still harsh, roasting their skin pitifully, but they float east and west, not returning until the boat is full. When the evening glow is brilliant and their slender hands are tired, some even have bloody fingers, congealing into the remaining glow, but they do not think it is hard. River lanterns are brightly lit, and the water caltrop market becomes noisy. People carrying burdens on their shoulders jostle against each other. Tomorrow, you will hear vendors everywhere on the streets and alleys calling out "Water Red Water Caltrop." It is said that one acre of water caltrop pond can yield one or two tens of gold. Those who work in this industry need not worry about wind and rain, nor about insect damage. In spring and winter rainy seasons, they can also collect fish, shrimp, reeds, and other benefits. In the past, Zhou He had the line "an old business, a pond of water caltrop." Truly, on the mountain peaks and by the water's edge, if one can exert their strength, they will have no shortage of food and clothing.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Qiantang, I saw that most of the water caltrop on the market was said to be produced in West Lake. The sellers also often falsely claimed this to deceive customers. In fact, West Lake has no water caltrop, it is transferred from Xiang Lake and Hushu area. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, when the moon is bright and the fragrance of clothing floats on the shore, the water caltrop and lotus root business is at its peak. People sit in the open air by the rippling mirror-like water, peeling and eating, and tourists all seem to replace mooncakes with them. Therefore, the usual dozens of texts per pound must be doubled on that evening. Near Hangzhou, water caltrop are mostly green, but east of Zhejiang, they are all胭脂艷 (unsure of meaning). This is probably due to the difference in water quality? If we talk about the sweet and crisp taste, the round water caltrop of South Lake are the best. They break easily when touched with the teeth, surpassing the taste of lotus root, and are unparalleled. Sometimes, the cool waves reflect the candle, and the beautiful ladies linger. They pick and offer the water caltrop to the guests, making people feel that the leisurely flavor is even better than serving silver cakes with wine. Lake caltrop have been recorded since the Tang Dynasty. Changgu's poem says: "One acre of white caltrop flowers in South Lake." I used to have a foolish idea: if I could return to my hometown one day, I would definitely open a ten-acre pond, specializing in planting water caltrop, lotus root, fish, shrimp, etc., and plant mulberry trees around the shore. Then I could sing and drink freely, which would be no different from the people above Xi Huang (a legendary ruler). Since I have lived in the world and experienced much, I know that this wish is not allowed. Even if I could get it, would the followers of Tao Yuanming allow me to survive in this world?</p>
<h3>Autumn Night on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>One new autumn evening, a group of three of us boarded the small train parked at Tiantong'an Bridge, letting it carry us away from a corner of this great metropolis.</p>
<p>The train was like a centipede, meandering along the two rails, gradually climbing into the vast wilderness. Some rivers and villages quickly flew past the train window. The gentle autumn wind, like the breath of a young girl, drilled in through the window, lightly kissing our faces.</p>
<p>We got off the train at Paotaiwan Station, stepping on this last sunset, facing the evening wind blowing from the sea, and quietly walked towards the sea. A light feeling floated lightly into our consciousness.</p>
<p>Poets love the sea because of its greatness and majesty, which can inspire life. The roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves can open up the secrets of the universe and break the dumb riddles of nature.</p>
<p>We strolled along the seashore. The meadows and famous embankments were crowded with idle urban men and women. This great sea unfolded before us. The faint shadows of sails in the misty depths and the white gulls flying across the sea and sky seemed like a mysterious dream. The tower lamp on the embankment lit up, as if it was a guiding light for our future, giving us a little light in the darkness. As night deepened, people gradually began to flow along the seashore. The surging tide and the howling sea breeze played together to form the symphony of the sea.</p>
<p>"Listening to the tide on a moonlit night, the clothes are thin and unable to withstand the cold." So, we boarded the last evening boat back to Shanghai to enjoy the cool. The steamer left the pier in the midst of the clamor of voices, breaking through the waves and heading towards the river. It went from the Wusong River to Yangshupu. On the river, only small steamers could be seen, shuttling back and forth. The scattered lights were like sparse fishing lights, tilting and swaying with the waves. The sharp whistle roared so loudly that it almost shattered our eardrums.</p>
<p>After the steamer sailed into the Yangshupu area, the river became very lively. Several foreign cruisers stood in the middle of the river, and countless sailors were huddled on the decks, singing tragic battle songs or decadent love songs. The small steamers in the middle of the river were whistling, which inevitably aroused a feeling of desolation. Several rowboats were racing in the undulating waves as if they were going against the current, as if they were in danger of being overturned by the waves at any time! The towering skyscrapers on both sides of the Puxi and Pudong rivers were closely arranged, and the dazzling lights were blinking like the stars in the sky. The red and green neon lights trembled like a dream in front of our eyes. The voices of people and cars were clearly transmitted from the shore. So, we had returned to the embrace of the great metropolis.</p>

<p>Era of Medicine</p>
<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>
<p>— By Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<h3>The Eve of a Couple's First Sexual Encounter</h3>
<p>How should the husband prepare to make his wife happy? Everyone should also take responsibility and be prepared to be a mother.</p>
<p>Even though we have already discussed many important topics about couple's knowledge, for the sake of making this issue extremely clear, it is necessary to discuss it further. Indeed, there are countless matters that need to be resolved between the two sexes. If we can carefully prepare for the most suitable and scientific methods before marriage, undoubtedly all post-marital disputes can be overcome one by one, resulting in a happy marriage life. Otherwise, the life after marriage will lose happiness, and who knows, one day it will turn into strangers again. Therefore, to avoid this tragedy from happening, we must first enrich ourselves with some knowledge necessary for health. Husbands cannot ignore the hygiene of the maturation period, especially the hygiene of the development of reproductive organs. Generally, the penis, testicles, prostate, seminal vesicles, etc. can develop properly. The reason is that the gonads secrete an endocrine fluid that promotes the development of reproductive organs. Therefore, the bad habit of masturbation during maturation often causes nocturnal emission and loss of seed secretion fluid. The reproductive organs will decline and stop developing. In addition, or due to congenital deficiencies, or as a result of excessive indulgence, not only will there be no satisfactory sexual organ development, but also after entering formal sexual life, premature ejaculation and impotence will cause you to fall into bursts of pain, and the other party will also be harmed, depriving her of the elasticity and stimulation of sexual life, and even unable to enjoy it!</p>
<p>However, the responsibilities of men towards women are also extremely important. Because in the minds of both men and women, they all hold the purpose and desire of having a family with many children after marriage. An infertile woman will be infinitely sad, and will even wash her face with tears because of it. If she herself is healthy, she will also develop a contempt for a man who is infertile. However, regarding the issue of fertility, the main conditions for pregnancy and the health and happiness of a woman's life are completely built on the regulation of menstruation. This is undeniable. A strong body means regular menstruation. Hermann affirmed this in 1915, proving that the health of both men and women must have sufficient endocrine in the gonads. If men suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, nocturnal emission, and women suffer from menstrual disorders, treatment with gonad endocrine preparations is the most reasonable. Today, the best comprehensive gonad endocrine agent is "Germinal," invented by Austrian physiologist Staner (available in male and female versions). It is most effective for men with premature ejaculation and impotence. However, those with nocturnal emission should also be treated with "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets." For women's infertility and menstrual problems: The genuine "Germinal" is packaged in iron boxes, and patients should not purchase fake medicines in paper boxes and bottles.)</p>
<p>Health Broadcasting Station</p>
<h3>An Anatomy of the Psychology of Male and Female Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>An effective treatment - dedicated to the lost sheep!</p>
<p>It is also an interesting thing to analyze the masturbation psychology of young men and women. A British psychiatrist once expressed it this way: There are many mentally ill patients whose behavior is almost entirely masturbatory. Like epileptics, sexual desire is even more亢進 (unsure of meaning) during or after an attack, leading women to commit adultery and men to commit sexual sins. Mr. Berlinger once specifically noted that healthy people sometimes masturbate unconsciously during sleep. Mr. Reyerfelder gave a specific example of someone feeling around their genitals. When menstruation came, the next morning the fingers were completely stained with menstrual blood. This is enough to prove that the genitals are indeed explored during sleep.</p>
<p>Among women, sometimes sexual dissatisfaction is compensated for by using masturbation - it is said that there are many such examples.</p>
<p>The degree of damage to the nervous system from masturbation is particularly significant. Children who have not yet reached puberty also commit masturbation. As for adults, there are particularly many who commit masturbation. Speaking of the consequences, men will inevitably suffer from seminal emission. Because after excessive masturbation, the sexual organs are abnormally sensitive. At the same time, due to the influence of seminal consumption, the精關弛懈 (unsure of meaning) and the control disappears. The decline of the body's glands causes the body's development to stop. Neurasthenia and sexual weakness are rampant, and the person has completely fallen into a dangerous situation. If the patient wants to be completely cured, in addition to recuperation, he should treat it with "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" and at the same time use "Germinal" to eliminate his neurasthenia, then the process will be good. Ordinary seminal emission will stop first, then nutrition will gradually recover, and finally symptoms such as neurasthenia and brain weakness will disappear like clouds and mist.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Methods for Quitting Smoking (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Doctor Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The safest and most reliable method for quitting smoking is gradual reduction combined with tonification. This method can reduce the associated suffering. However, if no appropriate remedies are used to assist with bodily weakness during the process, symptoms such as insomnia, leg cramps, lower back pain, mental unease, sneezing, drooling, and yawning will erupt successively, even leading to night sweats and seminal emission. How can a weakened body endure this? Quitters often fail midway due to these burdens. Therefore, the "Shengzhisu" (生殖素) preparation, a posterior pituitary gland extract, is worthy of recommendation for tonifying and assisting the smoking cessation process, as it can eliminate various difficulties and establish the final victory. If "Yu Wei Ci Baoming" (育維賜保命) injections are administered simultaneously, the quitting period can be shortened even further, making it the most advanced smoking cessation method today. The following successful case of a smoker quitting serves as strong evidence.</p>
<p>The smoker, Wu Xiaozu, is 27 years old and resides in Yongkang Lane, Avenue Auguste Bussière. He had been addicted to smoking for seven years. Currently, under pressure from his parents, he was ordered to quit. Because Mr. Wu's body was naturally weak, he had attempted to quit smoking once last spring, lasting three months, nearly reaching a critical state. Ultimately, due to the unscientific method of quitting, he relapsed into addiction. This summer, he tried the tonifying and gradual reduction method. He took "Shengzhisu" four times daily. After one week, he reduced his smoking by half and felt no discomfort. At the same time, he injected "Yu Wei Ci Baoming" once daily. After three weeks, he reduced his "Shengzhisu" dosage to three times daily, and his smoking quantity automatically decreased by half again. After five weeks, he had safely quit smoking, experiencing no pain and gradually strengthening his body.</p>

<h3>Relieving the Worries of Those Suffering From Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Doctor Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Superiority and Inferiority Among Bone Pain Medications</p>
<p>Worries from suffering bone pain are especially prevalent among those who are slightly older. It seems the weakening of physical strength that comes with age is also a significant direct cause of this condition. If this bone pain affliction only affected the elderly, that would be one thing. However, many young people in their twenties and thirties are already suffering from lower back pain, nearly losing their ambition and becoming listless and demoralized.</p>
<p>Why do young people contract this disease? Undoubtedly, it is due to excessive indulgence and loss of energy. Additionally, overexertion and ignorance of hygiene can lead to internal accumulation of wind-dampness, making bone pain inevitable. In mild cases, there is lower back pain. In severe cases, there are muscle and tendon pain, limb stiffness, and even numbness resulting from stiffness, leading to a state of paralysis. The progression of this disease often goes from mild symptoms being ignored by the patient to becoming severe, so early treatment is important to avoid unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>Regarding treatment methods, the most advanced therapy currently used in the medical field is the "Dr. Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" invented by the American bone pain expert Dr. Johnston. This medication is highly effective in treating this condition because it can fundamentally cure bone pain in a short period, whether it is due to impure blood, excessive uric acid, or internal wind-dampness, and it never recurs. It can also further prevent arteriosclerosis. Therefore, this medication is not only a symptomatic remedy for bone pain but also essential for preventing strokes. People with high blood pressure, obesity, and a red nose, who are prone to cerebral hemorrhage, should pay special attention and use this medication to prevent it and achieve real benefits. If you feel the suffering of lower back pain, I believe this is the only option!</p>
<p>The patient, Cheng Zhiliao, is 32 years old. Because he was fond of women, he exhausted his energy early on, resulting in impure blood. He had suffered from bone pain for five years. Initially, he only felt lower back pain, but later it spread to both shoulders, making it impossible to raise them. He had taken various medications with little effect. This spring, it flared up particularly severely, but a friend introduced him to "Dr. Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets." The pain stopped immediately. After taking them for two months, he felt his lower back refreshed and his bones relaxed. It has been half a year now, and he has not had a relapse.</p>
<h3>A Loud Appeal! Rescuing Those Headed for the Dangers of Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong (Wu Dachao)</p>
<p>Frankly speaking: Regarding the evaluation of self-treatment for gonorrhea, apart from the use of yellow acriflavine components, there is indeed no better medicine. We do not need to repeatedly promote a certain leukorrhea drug as effective or ineffective, because this does not benefit the patients. Attacks in the field of medicine also lack value. To earn valuable credibility with patients, we must be realistic. Forcibly involving or citing several outdated therapies, even if they fill the entire page, is worthless. For a contribution to a problem to be long-lasting and well-received, it must depend on whether the ingredients of the medicine are truly effective. Simply racking one’s brains to make pointless appeals without examining the efficacy and ingredients of the medicine is harmful to the patient.</p>
<p>Based on reality, to explain the effect of acriflavine and vaccine combination preparations, there is no need to cite clinical reports from various doctors. Simply think about it. The introduction of acriflavine by various doctors, like salvarsan (606) for syphilis, has been deeply imprinted in people’s minds. "Anti-Gonorrhea (安敵淋)," a combination preparation of acriflavine and vaccine invented by German Dr. Jadassohn, brings all the best qualities together. During my research at the venereal disease department of the University of Hong Kong, I compiled the views of various professors, proving that the ingredients of "Anti-Gonorrhea" have a special effect in treating gonorrhea. In recent years, I have repeatedly used this medicine to relieve patients’ pain and have never encountered failure.</p>

<h3>Beauty and Fitness Movements in Germany and Austria</h3>
<p>— Original Text by BLONGAND-EVANS of the United Kingdom, Abridged by Doctor Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The Shape-shifting Invention of Beauty Techniques; The Youth-Preserving Art of Breast Enhancement is Desired by Beauty-loving Women; Demonstrably Effective Without Surgery and Surpassing Paris</p>
<p>A healthy and beautiful figure is sought by men and women of every country. However, women are more eager than men. Therefore, the invention of beauty techniques is mostly targeted at women. Paris has always been renowned worldwide for its advancements in beauty techniques. In 1929, the Frenchman C. R. Stockard and G. N. RaPanicolaw first invented a surgical method to tighten the skin near the ears, completely eliminating all wrinkles on the forehead. However, in less than two years, the wrinkles became even more unsightly than before, proving the failure of surgical beauty methods. Furthermore, beauty does not only lie in removing a few wrinkles on the skin. The development of the buttocks, the fullness of the breasts, the rosiness of the complexion, and the fullness of the muscles cannot be altered by surgery. These are purely problems of endocrine disorders and the decline of the glands. The Austrian physiologist Steinach has a well-known reputation for his research on endocrine theory. He used female reproductive gland endocrine preparations, "Feminine Shengzhisu (女用生殖素)," to treat women with underdeveloped breasts and buttocks, and they were able to achieve the desired results. At the same time, because it has a great ability to promote metabolism, it can maintain youthful beauty for a long time. The German beauty expert Schultenaar praised this method greatly, saying: "Apart from 'Shengzhisu,' no other beauty technique is worth considering." Therefore, he vigorously promoted this method and cured many women with breast cancer in two years. Now, it is gradually recognized by various doctors as the only reliable preparation to promote development. If taken regularly, it can make one feel refreshed, sleep well, have a strong appetite, and have a youthful and vigorous appearance, skin, and strength, allowing one to be free from disease and not know what old age is.</p>
<p>Miss R. Shivoin from Austria, who won first place in the Paris beauty contest, was not satisfied with her breast development two months before participating in the competition. Therefore, she used the power of the reproductive gland endocrine preparation, "Feminine Shengzhisu," to suddenly make her breasts stand tall. This is truly the omnipotence of science.</p>

<p>— Compiled by Dr. Yao Erchang and Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company Building, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Clinic) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Masturbation Addiction and Underdevelopment</p>
<p>The patient, Jin Anzu, is 22 years old and from Suzhou. Excessive masturbation has greatly affected his development. (Chief Complaint) - He began masturbating at the age of seventeen and subsequently suffered from nocturnal emission. His genitals are small and he has phimosis. He has taken medicine for treatment, but because the medicine was not chosen properly, it had no effect. (Current Symptoms) - He has nocturnal emission five times a week, with occasional spermatorrhea, tinnitus, headache, palpitations, forgetfulness, and insomnia at night. Symptoms such as night sweats occur frequently. Not only are symptoms of neurasthenia mixed together, but his penis is the size of a finger, his testicles are abnormally small, and his phimosis is severe, with only a small hole revealing the urethral opening. In June of this year, he came for consultation through the introduction of his relative. (Treatment Method) - Dr. Zhan performed surgery to remove the phimosis, without any pain. He received electrotherapy once a day, and at the same time took "Hemitol's Spermatorrhea Pills" to stop nocturnal emission, and "Shengzhisu" internally to promote development. After two months, his body became strong and healthy, his spirit was vigorous, and he regained healthy development, which was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>(2) Impotence is the Enemy of Male Fertility</p>
<p>The patient, Zhang Dinggui, is 34 years old and from Anhui. (Chief Complaint) - Premature ejaculation, impotence, eleven years of marriage without children, and abnormal physical and mental weakness. (Medical History) - Mr. Zhang indulged in excessive masturbation in his early years, resulting in severe exhaustion of his energy. Subsequently, he suffered from nocturnal emission, and he had a feeling of pressure and discomfort near his anus for many years. After getting married in 1926, it worsened. He eventually became impotent, but sometimes he could have an erection, but it was completely unsustainable. (Treatment Method) - "Hemitol's Spermatorrhea Pills" were prescribed to treat spermatorrhea, and "Shengzhisu" was taken at the same time to cure his sexual weakness. In addition, prostatic cooling and effective massage were performed for about six weeks. All symptoms and sexual weakness and spermatorrhea were completely eliminated, and he recovered his health. His wife is now three months pregnant.</p>
<p>Safe Addiction Breaking</p>
<p>Editor: Since receiving Dr. Zhou's guidance on the tonifying and addiction-breaking method and taking "Shengzhisu," it has been fifty days, and I have also injected "Yu Wei Ci Baoming." My tobacco addiction has been completely eliminated without any pain. When I started quitting smoking, I took "Shengzhisu" four times a day, three tablets each time. After about two weeks, I reduced it to three times, and six weeks later, the addiction was broken and the medicine was stopped. (Wang Chengde)</p>
<p>Joint Pain</p>

<p>Treatment for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Editor: May I ask whether leukorrhea in women is a normal physiological phenomenon? This statement may not be close to the truth, but those who say it say it is harmless. I have had leukorrhea for two years, and although I wash frequently, the flow is still high, so I suffer greatly mentally. Please give me a reliable self-treatment method, I would be very grateful. (Zhao Aqiao)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can purchase "Leukorrhea Relief" from Wing On Company for external use, and take "Feminine Shengzhisu" internally, which can fundamentally cure and completely eliminate it.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Encourage Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>There was once a Confucian scholar who had no sons. He asked Ji Xiaolan for advice. Xiaolan replied, "This matter is entirely human desire and has no natural principles. You always hold the words 'natural principles' in your heart, so you cannot have a son. Look at animals, they move according to the season, and they are always successful because of this. From this, we can see that the way of childbirth is purely natural, and there is nothing to force or encourage."</p>
<p>At the annual convention of the German Socialist Party held on the 12th, leader Hitler gave a speech to 20,000 female party members, saying that any woman who can produce seven healthy and lively children has made a greater contribution to our nation than the most famous female lawyer. Hitler's words have great truth because one more healthy and lively citizen means one more strength for the country. If these 20,000 women each have seven children, they will get 140,000 strong citizens, which will add a different kind of splendor under the swastika flag.</p>
<p>Also, on the 12th, Italy held a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini and passed a new law to increase the birth rate in Italy. Afterwards, government and municipal positions will be given to married people first, and provincial and municipal governments will allocate funds to subsidize marriage and childbirth. Students and mothers of triplets will be given awards by the government. Fathers with eight children will have their children's education fees waived. This newly promulgated law is nothing more than an attempt to encourage childbirth, not only encouraging childbirth but also finding ways to support their lives after childbirth. Is this not a perfect way to encourage childbirth?</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of the teachings of Mencius in our country, which are the same as those of Hitler and Mussolini. Mencius said, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest." Why is having no descendants the greatest of the three unfilial acts? Although Mencius did not explicitly say it, it is simply because if the bloodline is cut off, the ancestors will have no descendants to offer sacrifices. Later generations of sex fanatics interpret this meaning as: first, to create life for the world, second, to extend the bloodline of the ancestors, and third, to maintain ethical norms for the family. However, this kind of argument was still the saying of the patriarchal society at that time. If it is interpreted with the current national socialist consciousness, it must be: first, to create welfare for the people, second, to increase the strength of the country, and third, to store up sharp weapons for killing. The times are different, so the applications are also different.</p>
<p>Why do Hitler and Mussolini want to encourage childbirth? Nothing more than to wage war, to sacrifice, to give their lives on the battlefield, to achieve their ambitious goals and hopes. However, the present is a world of scientific warfare. If war breaks out, the defeated country will inevitably sacrifice countless lives, and even the victorious country will suffer incalculable losses. Therefore, the encouragement of childbirth by Hitler and Mussolini is actually encouraging sacrifice. Are the women of Germany and Italy striving to give birth to meet the expectations of Hitler and Mussolini?</p>
<h3>Questioning the Simple and Convenient Public Dining Hall for People's Livelihood in This City</h3>
<p>— Xishan</p>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) In the city, many laborers who work like animals, their meager daily wages, in this expensive Shanghai, probably cannot even afford an ordinary meal.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>At the same time, due to the decline of the countryside and the depression of all industries in recent years, the number of hungry and unemployed people in the city is increasing day by day. In this situation, a public dining hall where one can get a sufficient meal for a low price is indeed urgently needed.</p>
<p>The Simple and Convenient Public Dining Hall for People's Livelihood in this city was created for the hungry masses of society in this situation. The organizer of the hall is Mr. Ling Youxian, an ordinary businessman, but he is very enthusiastic about social causes. Yesterday, I paid a special visit to his residence to inquire about the organization and overview of the Public Dining Hall. He explained the reasons for the establishment of the hall and everything inside very thoroughly.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Public Dining Hall has two reasons: (1) Due to the recent decline in the market and the increasing difficulty in people's livelihoods, the establishment of the Public Dining Hall hopes to directly reduce the consumption of common people. (2) In order to reduce the suffering of unemployed youth, the service personnel of the dining hall recruit ambitious young people and provide them with training and education to ensure that they have the ability to improve themselves.</p>
<p>The Public Dining Hall has been open for more than a year, and the number of diners has gradually increased, from fifty or sixty people per day to more than two hundred. Most of the diners are rickshaw pullers, laborers, and unemployed people. The dining hall sells two meals a day, lunch from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and dinner from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. The dining hall currently has two locations, both of which borrow space from vegetable markets. Tangjiawan Vegetable Market in West Gate is the first dining hall, and Lishe Vegetable Market on Lujiabang Road is the second dining hall. These two vegetable markets are under the jurisdiction of charitable organizations, so they are very convenient to rent. After the daily vegetable market is completed in the two vegetable markets, they are converted into dining halls.</p>
<p>The service personnel of the dining hall, in addition to the kitchen staff, total more than ten people in the two locations, all of whom are unemployed young people who have received considerable education. They mostly feel the difficulties of life after unemployment, so they are very willing to serve and do not feel ashamed of their low status. In terms of treatment, in addition to providing them with food, clothing, and accommodation, they are also given education in the morning.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ling, the funding for the dining hall is entirely his own responsibility. According to recent statistics, the first dining hall has about one hundred and dozens of diners per day, and the second dining hall has more than ninety, totaling more than two hundred in both locations. All the rice and dishes in the hall are sold at cost. The prices set for each meal are: white rice is sold for 10 copper coins per large can, 7 coins per medium can, vegetable dishes are 3 coins per plate, meat dishes are 8 coins per plate, soup is 3 coins per bowl, and fermented bean curd is 10 coins per piece. Most diners can have enough with a medium can of white rice and a plate of vegetables, so the cost per meal does not exceed four cents.</p>
<p>At the same time, I wanted to know about the equipment of the dining hall, so I wanted to go to the Tangliangwan Vegetable Market to see the first dining hall. It is a very simple dining hall that is built around the perimeter of the vegetable market. The entrance is the ticket purchase place, and diners must first purchase tickets there and then exchange the tickets for meals. The internal equipment is also quite complete. The cans and dishes for serving rice and dishes are all white porcelain. The storage of vegetables is also in line with the conditions of cleanliness. In the dining hall, there are several wooden long tables that can accommodate 150 people dining at the same time. The vegetables sold daily are also often changed. Vegetable dishes are mostly bean sprouts, vegetables, taro, tofu, and edamame. Meat dishes include yellow croaker, salted fish, and soy-braised shredded pork. All kinds of vegetables and meat are completely purchased fresh, and great attention is also paid to seasoning to make them suitable for the hygiene and taste of the public.</p>
<p>In the southern suburbs of the dining hall, there is also a parking lot because most of the diners for dinner at the first dining hall are rickshaw pullers. To avoid the loss of vehicles, the dining hall specifically hires a person to take care of them. When the rickshaw pullers leave their vehicles, they take a tag, and when they pick up the vehicle, they exchange the tag for the vehicle. This can also allow the rickshaw pullers to eat with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Finally, I felt that the establishment of the Simple and Convenient Public Dining Hall for People's Livelihood has indeed given great benefits to the urban poor. However, there seems to be a lack of such dining halls in Shanghai. Currently, there are only two locations in the South City. If they can be established everywhere in Huxi, Zhabei, and throughout the city, that would be the great happiness of the urban common people.</p>
<h3>Pig</h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>This year is a year of abundance.</p>
<p>The rice fields are growing fat and big, and the ears of rice are full like pearl rice, and the deep orange-yellow color makes the eyes of the farmers shine. During the harvest, people are singing mountain songs and working happily.</p>
<p>Now, it hasn't been long since the harvest was completed. The grains have been threshed, some are spread on the threshing floor to bask in the sun, and some have been loaded into baskets, ready to be transported out and pay the grain.</p>
<p>However, it was at this time that the rice market gave them a bolt from the blue. When there is no rain people complain to heaven, when there is big water people hate the Dragon King for playing tricks, but, it is a year of abundance, and the price of grain has fallen from four yuan to three yuan and six, making the farmers angry. — This year, it's really impossible to get justice.</p>
<p>The good times of the harvest disappeared somehow, and the swarthy faces of the people turned a darker shade of blue. Chenjia Village, like the eve of a storm, was covered tightly by low, dark clouds. The people under it could not breathe, and even dared not sigh loudly.</p>
<p>Time is getting tighter and tighter, and the news that the officials who were urging the grain and collecting land rent were coming to the countryside, like the magic of the snake tail dragon, stirred up the entire Chenjia Village.</p>
<p>Uncle Gui couldn't think of a better way, so he had to bite the bullet and discuss it with his wife.</p>
<p>"Agou, the grain collectors will probably come to the countryside in the next few days. Today I just happened to go to the market, and I was thinking of selling the pig you raised and settling the account."</p>
<p>"Are you crazy?" This woman could not bear to part with the pig he had raised with so much effort, so she replied like this. "He is my life, I won't sell him!"</p>
<p>"If you don't sell him, we can't pay the taxes!"</p>
<p>"Tell them to take the grain. It's not enough even if they take a few more dan. Does that mean those who farm have to lose their lives? I won't sell him!"</p>
<p>"Agou, there's no way out of this! Don't talk about the pig, if it's after a disaster year, even if Agou is sold, it won't be enough to pay that life-threatening rent!"</p>
<p>The man was sighing, but the woman started wailing.</p>
<p>"Heaven is forcing me to my death."</p>
<p>Uncle Gui gritted his teeth, carried the piglet, and came to the market in a fit of anger.</p>
<p>He passed by the tailor shop, the Daji Grocery Store, and Chen Laotong was telling the news there. —</p>
<p>"Chen Daniu's boss, those short guys, hey, I heard that they recently robbed some of our places again. I can't remember so much. The newspapers in the provincial capital are selling very well! Damn it, now they don't have to pay taxes to transport goods, look —"</p>
<p>He pointed his mouth towards the foreign goods store that had just opened across the street.</p>
<p>"Eighteen generations of ancestors brought these goods from there. They sell them so cheap, I don't even have enough for my capital. The people in the provincial capital call this smuggling, smuggling your mother's rotten stinking X!"</p>
<p>This news is indeed very new. In a while, it spread all over the market, and the people were a little angry.</p>
<p>"There's no way out, it's death either way, I can't care about so much."</p>
<p>These were the words of Daniu and the others, and Chen Laotong nodded slightly when he passed by.</p>
<p>Uncle Gui didn't quite understand what Laotong and the others were talking about, he just thought that they were just some "news." But later, when he inquired about the price at the rice shop, he heard the shopkeepers saying.</p>
<p>"This year is really a plague year! A good year is deceiving people, even we wouldn't have thought that the price of grain would fall so badly."</p>
<p>"I heard that someone is manipulating it in the dark."</p>
<p>"That Chinese and foreign grocery store sent people out to buy a lot!"</p>
<p>"Someone is playing tricks, no wonder the market has become so chaotic in an instant!"</p>
<p>The old man sighed, but the young man widened his eyes, bit his teeth angrily, and shook his fist in the air a few times.</p>
<p>The old farmer Uncle Gui also felt confused. A heat rushed to his throat, a little itchy.</p>
<p>When he came to the pig pen, when the old shopkeeper told him the price, he was so angry that he couldn't help but the fire rushed straight up.</p>
<p>"Isn't this less than half?" — He said angrily and stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Gui!" The person who bought the pig knew his difficulties. "It's not that I'm reducing your price. There's really no way out, there's no market in the provincial capital either, we can't do anything!"</p>
<p>His heart was firm, and he wanted to take the pig back. But, when he changed his mind, the life-threatening money and grain heavily knocked on his head, and the world went black. He said it as if he was enduring some great pain:</p>
<p>"Forget it!"</p>
<h3>Trivial Matters (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>Li Meizhen shook her head at me, displaying a look of disdain, indicating she didn't like listening to such things.</p>
<p>She, the only daughter of a sub-landlord, was a senior in a church middle school called something like "De."</p>
<p>I remember the first time she showed affection for me was when I said she looked a bit like "Jeanette MacDonald," which she loved. When she was free, she would sing all day long in a melodious voice: "The jade arms of my dream lover embrace me..." as if she really had become that flamboyant American movie star. — At that time, "The Private Life of Helen of Troy," which captivated people with its licentiousness, sensuality, and lust, was all the rage. Its toxin, which numbed people's nerves, permeated every corner of the metropolis. Some people with black eyes, dark hair, and yellow skin seemed to have forgotten the impending doom of being strangled by the devil and instead developed a deep friendship with this intoxicating fungus…</p>
<p>If the vegetable vendor Chen Ge was home (his room was always filled with the pungent and bitter smell of Zhu Guanglan cigarettes), he would smoke his raw-cut tobacco, looking extremely annoyed yet relaxed, and say:</p>
<p>"A good rooster doesn't crow at night."</p>
<p>When several neighborhood women gathered together, they would mutter jealous and malicious slanders.</p>
<p>"That woman looks just like a pair of frogs."</p>
<p>Someone said that.</p>
<p>That woman was a big child who hadn't fully matured, a stranger to human feelings and social niceties. She lacked social skills, spoke little, and was always silent.</p>
<p>"It's a world of progress, modern people value freedom—"</p>
<p>"Hmph, freedom to wipe out the whole family."</p>
<p>"... Free love, everyone likes it, so they can live together." (Meaning cohabitation...)</p>
<p>"Love?... Shameless thing, engaging in affairs."</p>
<p>"No need for you to worry, when that slut's belly gets big, you'll know, just wait and see."</p>
<p>The people conversing excitedly ended their conversation.</p>
<p>I was at a loss. I really didn't understand why those people only harbored feelings of jealousy, slander, and destruction towards new things. — It was probably a story like "the fox says the grapes are sour."</p>
<h3>Zhangpu</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>In the countryside of southern Fujian, we often see a type of farmer who comes across as particularly simple-minded: their bodies are unusually strong and dark, their clothes are tattered, and they have a braid around the back of their heads. These are the outstanding Zhangpu laborers. Perhaps because Zhangpu is so closed off, or because the land is barren and life is difficult, they always carry a carrying pole, two hemp ropes,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>and a dry tobacco pipe inserted into their waistband, and they go out to earn a living everywhere. Especially during the summer and autumn harvest seasons, these farmers are almost everywhere. During their wandering, they are temporarily hired for labor here and there; sometimes they don't even receive a penny and are hired by landlords as long-term workers (farm laborers), or they become live-in sons-in-law in other people's families. They are so content with coarse food and simple clothing and so diligent in their work that they surpass farmers from other counties.</p>
<p>"Go! Hire a Zhangpu laborer at the temple entrance or on the main road!" Whenever the harvest season arrives, not only landlords and rich farmers, but even middle farmers, when they are extremely busy, will shout this. Those who don't have sons of their own often plan like this: "Zhangpu laborers are really good, let's see if we can find a young one to marry into the family! Is one really going to toil for a lifetime alone?"</p>
<p>Indeed, the labor power of Zhangpu workers is frighteningly resilient: they can work hard for fourteen hours a day without feeling tired. Like cattle and horses, they never express anger or sigh. Because of this, those employers have no choice but to grudgingly provide them with three meals and two snacks a day, with each meal requiring one sheng of rice.</p>
<p>"They're like they've just been released from prison, eating six or seven large bowls of rice!" They sometimes stick out their tongues like this, but what can be done? Where else can you hire such good workers?</p>
<p>Zhangpu laborers always work barefoot, regardless of whether it's a rainy day or a scorching sun. They don't sing, and they rarely talk: only after eating do they squat down and take a couple of puffs from their dry tobacco pipes. In their simple minds, the summer and autumn harvest seasons are truly like the golden age of the year. They always agree with each other beforehand and prepare carrying poles and ropes: then they set off on foot in groups of three or five towards destinations more than a hundred li away—other counties. In the past, when they were hired for a whole day, they not only had food to eat but could also earn eight mao; during that short harvest period of a month or so, ten or so yuan was easy to come by. Therefore, when they returned home, we could always see those dark and shiny smiling faces and cloth and shoes tied with rope at one end of the carrying pole. But in the past two years, they have been disappointed. No matter how they looked with pleading eyes, lowering their voices to inquire about work everywhere, it was ineffective. Moreover, wages have also dropped from eight mao to four mao. Why have those employers become so stingy? They can understand it. But they still go out to earn a living season after season, just like displaced northerners, lingeringly. Perhaps things are even worse in their hometown, or they hope that good times will come?</p>

<p>Opening: "Plum Blossoms in Snow"</p>
<p>Seeking plum blossoms, we tread through snow to enjoy spring. Plum blossoms and snow shine together, a scene of renewal. We see that plum blossoms occupy the most enchanting part of spring, and snowflakes fly in six-petaled formations, revealing their spirit. It is said that northern plum blossoms and southern snow are the treasures of the singing stage. We see that white snow and red plum blossoms create exquisite paintings. We remember that Princess Shouyang had plum blossom marks on her forehead. We remember Lan Guan being blocked by snow during a long expedition. We remember Mei Kai Dongge being called He Xun. We remember standing in the snow at the teacher's door, with the surname Cheng. We see that snow fills the gardens, and plum blossoms nurture jade. We see that plum blossoms bloom on the mountain ridges, like snow covering silver. We see that snowflakes like palms flutter towards the plum blossoms. We see plum blossom shadows slanting across, mistaken for snow-sweeping people. There are people who appreciate snow around the stove, with plum blossoms on the table. There are people who chew plum blossoms and boil tobacco, sculpting snow Guanyin. Know that the cold plum blossoms brave the snow and bloom in the cold. Know that admiring plum blossoms in heavy snow is precisely when the imperial messenger arrives. Sing a song, making friends with the cold plum blossoms and snow.</p>

<p>Opening: "Etiquette and Marriage" (Mimi Compilation Issue)</p>
<p>A hundred-year marriage is tied with a penny. Half by human effort, half by heaven's will. Ma Rong did not begrudge his own daughter. Sending her to marry a poor scholar, a handsome young man. Gladly, the fisherman's wise father and daughter. Catching nine tails of fish, extremely fresh. Wine and dishes prepared. Incense lit. Heaven-sent marriage suddenly connected. Respect heaven and earth, worship ancestors. Honeymoon night in a broken kiln. The woman works with needle and thread to make a living. Diligently studies books, adding lamp oil. Endures hunger and cold without complaint. Accompanied by the lamp, reading the sages. Unexpectedly, a smooth rise on the career path. Holding a jade tablet before the imperial steps. Liang Ji's iceberg easily collapses. Ma Rong is the most pitiful one implicated. Detained in prison. Who can he tell his regrets to now? Affection between father-in-law and son-in-law, righteousness between father and daughter. Otherwise, filial piety cannot be fulfilled. Slapping his elbows, they meet again. It's hard to hide the shame at this moment. Reunion of flesh and blood sitting at a splendid banquet.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>About the Performance of the Chinese Translation of "Homeland"</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Mian and Mr. Tang Huaiqiu have very insightful decided to first select some psychological dramas with rough lines, because this way they can gain the understanding of the audience.</p>
<p>In fact, movies have indeed gradually made people in the Far East understand that our tragedies and comedies, broadly speaking, movies are to drama as long novels in newspapers are to literature, which is only a captivating beginning.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen and Tang are indeed insightful. In Beiping, Nanjing, in the interior, and in Shanghai, they selected, translated, and performed plays that were relatively easy to understand, with moving plots and solid techniques. They performed "La Traviata," a play that has been successful in Europe and America. Surprisingly, it has been promoted to China.</p>
<p>They are now presenting "Homeland" to everyone. Now that this play is to be performed in France, we can have many opinions. Sardou's plays were very popular between 1870 and 1914, but now we feel that he is a bit outdated. Because the technique of his plays is too perfect, every aspect of his plays has subtle calculations to arouse the audience's curiosity, but there is a lack of truly moving tones.</p>
<p>Sardou paid great attention to stage design and effects, which are all methods of touching the senses. The horror plays that followed used this formula. Although "Homeland" does not actually show the scene of secret trials and executions, we can hear the cries of the victims, and the red light outside the window in one scene of "Homeland" can make us imagine the burning pile of firewood, but these effective methods can only be loved by the audience for a short time.</p>
<p>Sardou was the most authoritative figure in the French theater scene for forty years. Now, his "Madame Sans-Gêne" still has great appeal. Sardou is not only a technical writer, he also has soul, interest, and subtle observation. His comedies, which are now forgotten, should not be forgotten because his comedies are indeed stronger than his tragedies. If his "Rabagas," this immortal comedy, were performed by a director like Charles Dullin, who would dare to say that it would not be a sensation? It is also that our customs have changed, and "Rabagas," which could cause a stir sixty years ago, can no longer surprise our audience.</p>
<p>In any case, Sardou, who could still excite all of Paris with the play "The Poison Affair" in the same year, will surely be welcomed by the Chinese people, because they have not yet become tired of this technique. Moreover, his technique does have recognizably good value, and the patriotic ideals contained in "Homeland" should be sympathized with by Chinese youth.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Mian and Mr. Tang Huaiqiu's efforts are worthy of our double admiration, because they are introducing our theatrical art to their compatriots, and they are working hard to create new plays. Our country adds a new and individualistic art. (The End) (Translated from the Shanghai French Daily, September 10th)</p>

<h3>"Mr. Wang's Chivalrous Adventures" Has a Pure Theme</h3>
<p>Director Zuo Ming's "Mr. Wang's Chivalrous Adventures" has been released at the Jincheng Grand Theater since the 17th. This is a film that takes a realistic theme in the form of a comedy and points out a bright path for the audience. Director Zuo used his new style to expose the dark side and strange phenomena of society, such as the treachery of people's hearts, the suffering of laborers, the ugliness of false patriots, and the dreams of small property owners, which can be said to have exhausted the ability of humor and satire.</p>
<p>Because "Mr. Wang's Chivalrous Adventures" is performed in the form of a comedy, the whole film is full of hilarious jokes, but its theme is so pure and its meaning is so great that the audience will have serious aftertastes after laughing.</p>
<h3>Chatting About "Carnival Night"</h3>
<p>"Carnival Night" is another great contribution of Xinhua Company after "Peach Blossom Spring Dream."</p>
<p>"Carnival Night" is Shi Dongshan's exquisite masterpiece after "Song of Everlasting Sorrow."</p>
<p>The stars of "Carnival Night" are Hu Ping, Jin Shan, Gu Eryi, Zhou Xuan, Yin Xiuqin, Gu Menghu, Shi Chao, Jiang Xiu, You Guanren, etc., who have a very deep history in film and stage.</p>
<p>"Carnival Night" is adapted from the famous play "The Inspector General" written by the great Russian writer Gogol, which is a work with very beautiful and profound meaning.</p>
<p>"Carnival Night" is a vicious satire on corrupt politics.</p>
<p>"Carnival Night" is a powerful bomb thrown at the officialdom of flattery and oppression.</p>
<p>The dialogue in "Carnival Night" is very witty and humorous, making people excited and stimulated.</p>
<p>"Carnival Night" is full of not noisy slapstick, making you laugh and angry.</p>
