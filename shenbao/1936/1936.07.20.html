<p>時評</p>
<h3>我國銀行業的新趨向</h3>
<p>— 彥</p>
<p>我國的商業銀行。自從經過了去年的金融恐慌。很多已經縮小範圍了。最近在放欵與組織的方式上。還有着一種新的趨向。</p>
<p>商業銀行的放欵。在工商業方面。因近年工商業的衰落。早已感覺了困難。在投機方面。又因通貨管理以。後難求有利的發展。在這種情形之。下銀行為减輕放欵責任起見。對於資金的運用。數額力求其分散。放欵的對象。則從工商業轉移到農村與政府建設事業。最近如江浙春繭銀團漁業銀團等的組織卽是一例。</p>
<p>至於銀行的組織。則漸漸地由分散而趨向於集中了。前幾年的商業銀行。差不多是日增月盛的。但力量的微薄。人材的分散。却是免不了的事。最近的趨向。比較性質相同的銀行。如中匯與江浙銀行江蘇與綢業銀行是在進行合併了。合併後業務的進行怎樣。雖不可知但就集中力量這一點說來。是值得稱許的。</p>
<p>放欵對象趨向於農村及國家建設事業。就國民經濟的觀點說來。當然是對的。但應該注意者。以今日工商業的衰落。固然不容易輕言投資。可是工商業的衰落。乃環境使然。所以如何用力量帮助工商業從黑暗中掙扎出來。仍是金融業者的一部份責任。關於農村或農產品的放欵。我們以為放欵者應該同時注意到商業環境。過去的絲茶放欵。往柱引起過額放欵的弊害。其結果造成農產品價格的暴跌。而陷農民及本身於不利的地位。至於恊助政府建設事業。其利息雖仍轉嫁於一般國民。但比較前幾年的利用公債的重利盤剝。當然是不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>商業銀行合併以後。力量加厚。業務上的發展計劃。自亦容易實。施我們對於這些銀行此後的業務計劃。有着兩個小小的希望。（一）集團中每一銀行最好是分別認定了目標去做。如此則分工旣細。觀察也可以周到。（二）過去許多商業銀行。開辦時因着資金的限制。大多數集中在上海的一角。形成了都市金融的獨特膨脹。合併以後。如果因各種關係。脫離不了都市。也希望多分些力量到內地去。以盡調劑金融的責任。</p>

<h3>日本旅行記</h3>
<p>— （五）本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>（四）神戶市廳</p>
<p>次日早上，我們再到總領事館去，會到總領事江華本。江總領事在外交界資格很老，曾經任過使館代辦，駐神戶也有數年了。他那浮着微笑的老成的圓臉使我們一見就感到親切。我們就旅行的日程跟他商談了一番，打算在神戶再住一天，去參觀市役所（市廳）和幾個報館。江總領事便給我們預備好幾　介紹信。我們拿了信，在領館門外坐上一輛「太克希」，直到市役所去。</p>
<p>神戶市役所在凑東區橘通，是一所口字形的宏壯的大厦。門面一列是三層樓，其他三列是二層樓，當中一個大院子種着幾棵芭蕉。門前是水門汀築成的隆起的大廣塲。我們的汽車從馬路依着平坦的坡度開上去，便到了門口，抬起頭來，看得見高高的門額上用水門汀砌成的交叉的兩個弧形，這同諏訪山上的一個標記一樣，就是神戶的市徽。一進大門，我們便見右邊門內一張小桌邊坐着一個警服的傳達員。我們向他遞了名片，要謁見市長勝田銀次郎。他引了我們上樓，在市長申外的會客空裏等了片刻，於是秘書甲斐軍喜出來，代表廣市長跟我們談話。我們就神戶市最近的發展情形間了一番，承他一一的答覆如下：</p>
<p>神戶的對外貿易聽說近年來有着很大的發展。不知道比起貴國其他的商港來究竟怎麽樣？</p>
<p>神戶港的對外貿易，從前在輸出方面不及橫濱，在輸入方面超過橫濱，可是近年來輸出和輸入的貿易都超過橫濱了。去年本港的對外貿易總額計有日金十三萬萬元光景，的佔全國貿易總額的三分之一。在日本三大貿易港中，就輸出入貿易的總額來說，神戶居第一位，橫濱居第二位，大阪居第三位。</p>
<p>貴國各大都市的行政當局對於工商業于的勵和保護，是我們素所佩服的。關於這方面，貴市採取着怎樣的辦法，請先生賜敎。</p>
<p>本市凑川公園設有勸業館。工商界要舉行什麽商品樣子陳列會，展覽會或是博覺會，都可以借那個地方做會塲。官廳方面常然盡力指導着。此外對於當地工商業的獎勵和介紹也隨時計畫着實施着適當的辦法。本市商工課派有專員常駐在滿洲，辦理介紹本市工商業的事宜。此外市役所還調查着本市工商界的狀况，每年編印「神户市商工要覽」「神户市商工名鑑」等冊子，以便一般工商業者的查考。</p>
<p>貴廳對於勞動階級市民的福利，當然也很關心到。不知道可有什麽特殊的設施，使他們在生活上得到實際的好處？</p>
<p>答本市所舉辦的社會事業，同本國其他的都市差不多。沒有什麽特殊的可說。我們辦着關於民衆衛生的好些機關外，還為窮苦勞動者食住兩瑣着想，設有公衆食堂和共同宿泊所多所。公衆食堂的性質是在把淸潔滋養的食品，供給勞動者，取費極便宜。食券分五種，最低是三錢券，最高是十一錢的定食券。共同宿泊所設備很周全，每宿只收宿費十七錢</p>
<p>接着，我們問甲斐秘書；「貴市最近的財政狀况怎樣？每一市民租稅的平均負擔額多少」？</p>
<p>他尋思了一會，便引導我們到財務課去。那是很大的一個房間。密排的舊寫字抬坐滿着西裝的課員們，埋頭在雜亂的紙堆裏。他跟一位課員談了一會，回頭對我們說：「財務課長沒有在這裏。近一年來的財政狀况，要問明了他才可以知道。不過你們要知道昭和九年度的，我可以去我些印刷品來」。神戶市役所</p>

<p>瑪德里　西班牙政府雖自稱摩洛哥之生嚴重騷亂之消息、又紛紛傳來、目下擾亂之中心、只限於塞維爾·布爾哥斯·及潘坡魯那各地、但恐不久卽將蔓延全國、政府方面之密探等、現正從事搜捕全國法西斯及左翼各派之首領、據稱、彼等有策劃反革命之嫌疑、今晨此間當局發出官方無綫電一通、內稱已有騎兵一聯隊、派往塞維爾、所有被反政府軍隊宣佈警備狀態各區域中之工人、現已由工團領袖加巴里羅氏、用無綫電廣播、促彼等宣牙境內有數處地方、確有不安狀態、但表示信任此項運動將限於地方性質、不致擴大、據政府方面宣稱、摩洛哥之變亂、經忠於政府乏軍隊與變兵激戰數次後、已吿肅淸、陸軍飛機在此次戰事中、奏功甚偉、此次變亂、昨日首在西屬摩洛哥西北部之米里拉及扣塔兩地爆發、駐於該處之官籍軍團兵士二萬名、實行嘩變、據云、米里拉之居民因宣布全體罷市、企圖抵抗變兵、致有九人被殺、台端地方發生擾亂時、亦有三人被害、該地辦事專員公署、已被變兵佔領、以上變亂爆發之消息到達瑪德里後、卽有西班牙海軍艦隊旗艦兩艘、立時奉派由卡塔奇那開往摩洛哥、同時各忠於政府之軍隊、亦奉令平難、昨晚此間接得消息、陸軍飛機正在轟擊米里拉及扣塔兩地之叛衆、未幾官方正式證實已採取緊念嚴峻之計畫、遏制革命運動、今日侵晨文據公布、摩洛哥亂事被逮、警察曾扣留外國飛機一架、據云尼載亂首一人、由摩洛哥前往西班牙、昨日下午政府宣稱叛黨已佔據扣塔無綫電臺、發出無綫電、宣佈塞維爾瑪德里等處已發生亂事等情、但據今晨公報宣稱、西班牙全國安靜如常云、亂黨所稱陸軍部長內務部長被俘消息、全屬子虛、幸賴政府取迅雷不及掩耳之手段對付亂事、今已可視為消滅矣云、聞著名右翼某領袖已被亂衆謀害、惟尙不能證實、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪里德　昨晚及今晨、政府已在無綫電中正式承認摩洛哥之叛變已蔓延及西班牙本土、最初僅稱塞維拉之軍隊反叛、繼復承認已波及瑪拉加及卡狄茲、內政部發言人則稱、叛徒之勢已漸减弱、據稱當時有武裝工人四十名强登駐泊巴塞龍那港內之舟、奪得來復槍五十支、旋卽由挺進守衛隊將彼等撲滅、並收回奪去之槍械、政府昨晚已下令解散叛變之軍隊、且將卡那里羣島總督撤職、一面則用戰艦運陸軍一隊前往執行政府之職權、內政部長摩爾斯昨晚在無綫電中宣布、政府之飛機已着手轟炸摩洛哥叛軍之險要地點、至於西班牙本國境內、則內長尙稱所有軍隊皆忠於政府、故政府儘有餘力可以應付摩洛哥之事變、民衆方而不應注府鑒於事態之急迫、已採取斷然手段、逮捕軍事長官數人云、據悉海軍方面亦有長官若干已被撤職、其罪狀為違抗命令、西班牙全境之航空郵件自昨日起已完全停運、他國之運郵飛機則仍可降落、惟須先得准許、內長且謂政府已扣留外國飛機一架、將用之飛往麼洛哥載某叛黨領袖回此云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>叛軍聲勢浩大</h3>
<p>直布羅陀　傳聞今日在加狄士登陸之西屬摩洛哥叛軍、現向塞維爾進發、意欲與該地叛衆會合、以進窺西京瑪德里、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>北菲洲丹吉爾港　頃據塞維爾城廣播消息云、寨維爾駐軍副師長德里亞諾將軍、業已加入叛軍、自稱為「解軍」、幷發出佈吿、婆求人民加以擁護、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>無綫電宣傳戰</h3>
<p>瑪德里　自北菲洲摩洛哥屬地駐軍發生叛變之後、此間「聯合電台」與北菲洲休達城無綫電台、各用廣播電音發表報告、前者為政府作喉舌、後者已由叛軍佔領、其所宣傳適屬相反、雙方唇槍舌劍、儼如作無綫電戰爭矣、例如休達電台所發消息、謂政府派往摩洛哥海岸巡戈各軍艦已落叛軍之手、現正回棹向西班牙海岸進駛中、「聯合電台」卽於本日午後五時十五分發表廣播公報、否認此說、幷謂各軍艦始終效忠政府、刻正奉令開赴菲洲海岸、不久即可到達、又謂摩洛哥駐軍附逆者僅有一小部份、該處民政官廳現仍忠於政府、所有民衆當唯民政官之命令是從、又謂摩洛哥境內並未頒佈戒嚴令云云、此項公報並發表右派衆議員魯西亞來電一通、表示效忠政府、（按魯西亞係佛朗西亞省自治黨黨員、而附屬於前陸軍部長盧卜爾斯所領導之西班牙右派各黨聯合會、盧氏為現政府所不容、業已逃往法國、）至晚間七時四十五分、「聯合電台」又發表廣播公報、謂全國各省現均效忠政府、若干城市所發生之騷擾現已迅吿敉平、叛將圭北將軍雖在塞維爾城非法頒佈戒嚴令，但其部下叛軍已向官軍歸降、騎兵一團頃已開入該城民衆高呼「西班牙共和國萬歲」以示歡迎、目前政府已能完全控制時局矣云云、此外京城社會主義派各工會頃已决定在頒佈戒嚴令各處地方自動舉行總罷工、非至秩序恢復之後不允復工、此項决定、已由社會黨極端派領袖加巴萊洛以各　會曁各勞工團體名義予以宣佈、並由聯合電台」播送各處、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>政變主動人物</h3>
<p>（巴黎）小巴黎人報訪員、頃自貝比尼盎城（在法國南部西班牙邊界附近）發出消息稱、「西國此次政變、係由三人主動、一卽右派天主敎黨領袖盧卜爾斯、一卽散茹爾佳將軍、（前於一九三二年八月間稱亂被執、會判處死刑、嗣改為永遠監禁、迄至一九三四年四月、始獲赦免、）一卽前獨裁者里維拉將軍之子、其人現在獄中、但有獄卒與之同謀、彼等所預定之計畫、乃以索台洛（保王黨領袖日前被刺）為新政府領袖、保安隊已允加以贊助、緣保安隊員、多屬右派、素與左派衝鋒隊相水貨、因而參加政變」云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法國貝爾比永　美聯社近日自可靠方面得悉、摩洛哥米里拉駐軍之叛變、實為一種全國革命之計劃、惜未成熟、卽遽爾爆發、按該項計劃係上月中成於農民黨領袖羅布爾家中、參加密謀者有已故西班牙狄克推多之子里維拉等、及陸軍將領民團長官各三人、當時里維拉猶因私藏軍火被禁獄中、乃竟由獄卒釋出、原來之計劃為摩洛哥及卡那里羣島二處駐軍同時叛變、得手之後卽開返本國、屆時國內軍隊亦將響應、另組新政府、以保守黨領袖索台洛為總統、然索氏忽於七月十三日在瑪德里被人暗殺、以致米里拉之軍隊時機未熟、卽行發動云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）斐伽洛報駐瑪德里訪員、頃自該處行抵法國邊界、當用長途電話與該報通話、據稱、西班牙此次政變計劃、係由保王黨與法西斯派會同擬定、其內容略如下述，（一）當在北菲洲摩洛哥屬地、首先起事、該處軍官多係保王黨黨員、卽客籍軍與摩爾族土著士兵、亦可出而響應、（二）摩洛哥發難之後、政府勢須調集大軍、前往术國南部鎭懾、此項部隊一經到達、卽當繼之譁變、（三）本部境內、當在西東曁東南三方面、同時舉事、並向瑪德里城進攻、（甲）西部當由將官一員、自葡萄牙國潛入加里西亞省舉事、（乙）東部邦柏魯納省、當由另一將官統率駐軍、反抗政府、（丙）東南部駐軍、亦當起而響應、此外叛軍方面、以為政府雖將電報電話、盡行截斷、但叛軍當可運動蒲哥斯空軍根據地空軍人員、參加叛亂、為之傳遞消息云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>廣田內閣到何處去（三）</h3>
<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>廣田好似不滿足於上述的否認，還一身都是肌地，與政友會著名自由主義者植原悅二郎，在預算會中唱着一套雙簧。植原先肯定地說：「拜受大命者，如不能自由選擇其閣僚，則立憲政治運用之完璧，不可得而期也。」。然後暢談廣田組閣的經過，質問：「此次組閣，首相之體騐為何」？</p>
<p>廣田答道：「拜受大命者，由陸軍內部推薦認為適當之人，是可能的」。</p>
<p>「這大槪是錯了吧！按一直至今天止的慣例，陸軍大臣的人選，是在三長官間决定而推薦的，這總算是周知的事實」。</p>
<p>「我說的並沒有錯」。</p>
<p>植原另接着質問：「在世聞均以為政府之外尙有軍部，……首相所見為何」？廣田毅然答他。。「世間人如此說，我亦聽見過，我打算努力沒有那樣的事發生」。這種一口抹煞事實的强辯，是對軍部表明：今日的宏毅，非昔之廣田。所以，當五月十二日三室戶敬光子，在貴族院裏，重新提出組閣心境質問時，他以楠公刀折矢盡於凑川的情况相吿。我們知道，楠术正成盡忠節於日本皇室時，天下已有南北朝兩統之爭，「二·二六」政變，詳細的內幕為何，我們尙不得而知，而廣田宏毅敢以楠木正成自命，不亦奇乎？這一點，請犬家細細地咀嚼。</p>
<p>廣田內閣，不獨在議會面前，否定了自己組閣時被强奸似的抱負，而且另與政黨携手質問軍部，批評軍部。最精采的，就是民政黨齊藤降夫的演說。這個具有歷史任務的演詞，日本有產者的報紙，都用極大的篇幅登載牠，除室伏高信帶諷刺的「其聲也哀」（讀讀五·一二夕刊）外，如大阪每日，譽為「國民之聲」，（五，九）。東朝稱為「句句是國民之言」。議會裏映出空前的情緖，不分派別地，致報以熱烈的掌聲。本來打算發表同樣演詞的安藤正純（政友會），也自動撤回。</p>
<p>齊藤隆夫用美麗的詞句，指出下述各點：「第一是軍人干政」。他說：「現役軍人談論政治，參加政治活動，屬於不可爭之事實，軍部對此究取怎樣的態度」？他先博引明治大帝賜軍人的勅諭，和伊藤博文的憲法義解，證明軍人不能干政，然後，名正言順地，用干政便是違反聖旨的大帽子，加在軍部的頭上，還指出軍人的思想單純，不能應付複什的社會狀况，易為人利用，而至於直接行動，「五·一五」便是牠的活證。在這個結論之後，他返身問寺內大將道：「陸相對於此點高見以為如何」？第二，他非難軍部對付每决事變的態度。他引著名日本外史作者賴山陽批評中古政權歸武門的原因：「歷代朝廷」對源平二氏姑息倫安，優柔寡斷之態度，而不知基異日「搏噬攘奪之禍」以戒陸相，並高呼：「茍軍人結黨，白晝公然闖入總理大臣官邸，槍殺天皇陛下親任一國之總理大臣，執為護國之故而授與之兵器，暗殺當國政燮理大任之國家最高之重臣，其罪之重大，「誠無容贅言」。他又沉痛地揭出，陸軍如何破壞國家的法律尊嚴，用「五·一五」時，憲兵危害主張繩參加政變者以法之山本檢察官的事實，非難軍部。最後下着政變責任的斷語：「對於某某事件，軍部的態度，嘆出××事件；對於××事件，軍部的態度，又喚出「五·一五」事件；對於「五·一五」事件，軍部的態度，實惹起此次的一大不祥事件」。第三，他公言近來靑年行為，「一以愛國之名行之，一以無產大衆之名行之」。此右傾及左傾，均有害於國偉業之立憲君主制度，此外，我國民可進之道，則絕對無之」；而揭現階段廣田內閣的使命。第四，他似乎面對政友會議席，大呼：「若軍部以外之政治家，或與軍部內一部分相結托通謀，而欲行政治上之野心，如若有此等之人，則决不宜放過，苟為立憲政治家者，以國民為背景，應正正當當站在民衆之前，為國家計，以公明正大之手段，從事政治上之門爭。如伏幕內策動，企圖不穩之陰謀，則斷為立憲政治家所不許之事」。</p>

<h3>蘇聯航空事業突飛猛進　空軍實力淩駕歐美列強　民間活動跌創優美紀錄</h3>
<p>華聯社特稿蘇聯政府當局對於航空事業的推行提倡、不遺餘力、結果已凌駕歐美各列强、成為世界第一流的航空國了、回億十月革命以後、全國陷於混亂狀態、一切事業均凋落不振、至一九二一年政府當局鑑於蘇聯為一擁有龐大土地之大陸國、為保衛革命勝利、防禦外國進攻、應以建設空軍為急務、因乃確立計劃積極進行、至非軍用航空事業則自一九二三年以後始開始活動、前後僅歷十四年、結果乃至執全世界航空界之牛耳、其奮發猛進之精神、殊足為吾人效法、爰將最近該國之航空實况、介紹於後、俾關心國防問題者知所警惕、</p>
<p>空軍威力</p>
<p>蘇聯空軍兵力、在一九二二年僅有陸上部隊二十中隊、至一九二五年卽增加至八十中隊、一九二八年增至一百中隊、現今已達三百五十中隊、飛行機四千架以上、其中尤以戰鬭機轟炸機的增加發達、尤為可驚、預計第二次五年計劃成功後、當達八千架之多、當該擴張空軍之各項材料、均係由德意英法購入、幷分向各該國聘請專門家、負責建設航空工廠、但自第一次五年計劃成功以後、因積極促進開發航空工業及其原料資源、大量培植技術專門家之結果、現在亦已可完全自己製造新型銳利之飛行機了、蘇聯空軍之中最為特色的、是空中降落部隊及現在建造中的運兵飛機、而且落下傘技術、在國內極為普遍、歐美各國完全不能望其項背、這種空中降落部隊、係以抄出敵人後方為目的、去年九月在烏克蘭共和國首都基埃夫市附近舉行演習、成績極為圓滿、一時世界人士均大受衝動、</p>
<p>民用航空</p>
<p>蘇聯政府對於建設民用航空的企劃經營、如航空綫的開拓、飛行家的養成等等、也都是以國防為中心、俾一旦有事、可立即轉為軍用、據當局發表、在一九二三年全國僅有外國製之飛機十二架、航空路總延長亦只達一千六百六十六基羅米突、全年中乘客只三千人、貨物輸送量二萬一千二百九十一格蘭姆、但至一九三五年末、飛機已增至數千架、航空路總延長亦達七萬七千基羅米突、據統計去年度乘客共為十一萬一千人、郵件輸送量為六千六百噸、貨物為五千噸、把龐大的數字與十二年前比較、即可知其推進發展之迅速、</p>
<p>特殊供獻</p>
<p>蘇聯民用飛機、不但用於運輸交通、而且在特殊工作方面、也非常活躍、而有偉大的供獻、如攝影測量·北極探險·捕獲魚類及海獸·驅除害虫·播種秤子等、均有優秀之成績、依統計去年共調查森林面積三千五百萬赫克脫、播種田地十二萬赫克脫、驅除農業及林業方面之害虫害獸五十六萬赫克脫、驅除麻拉里亞蚊」二百四十三萬五千赫克脫、</p>
<p>創新紀錄</p>
<p>蘇聯民衆在政府提倡激勵之下、對於航空興趣極濃、時常創造優美之新紀錄、其重要者如滯留空中七十五小時、翔破一萬二千四百十一基羅米突之長距離飛行、上昇一萬一千八十米突之高空、飛行七千六百十二米突之降落傘表演、及上昇一萬五千米突之成層圈飛行等、均可打破世界或蘇聯的前此紀錄、博得全球航空界之熱烈讚美、</p>
<p>北極飛行</p>
<p>蘇聯當局除充實擴充國內航空事業之外、並傾注全力於北極航空路的開拓、結果毛洛哥夫已完成由莫斯科經斯威魯德羅夫·斯克羅烏西比爾斯克·庫拉斯羅塞爾斯克·伊鄂爾卡特烏進卡等地、而抵達精克生島的飛行、同時威亞塔比亞洛夫及林齊里兩飛行家、也完成莫斯科西米特灣間航行、其距離均達一萬三千五百基羅之遠、均在蘇聯航空史上寫下光榮的一頁、給落後國家以一個有力的策勵、</p>

<h3>南巡佳話</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>浙東不幸的婦女</p>
<p>由蘭谿西門、沿江邊走到南門、往西南隔江一望、那裏有個梭形的靑山、名呌橫山、恰常衢港婺港會合的要衝、山的東麓和半腰、還有寺廟、明武宗御題「蘭陰深處」的四字、就刻在半山的石壁上、把視綫收回來、便見靑山白寺、倒影江中、問得上下風帆的點染、眞似一幅嵐光雲影的美景畫、再把視綫一收、那你一定就發現許多斜靠在岸邊的畫舫、和無數低掛在江岸的小茶樓、那就是一般富商消情縱慾的花叢、也是不幸婦女迫賣肉體的罪地、</p>
<p>蘭谿之有花舫、不知起自何時、不過見請記載的、却自洪楊始、此間是浙東一大水陸碼頭、商業口益繁盛、民國八九年之交、花舫多至九十餘艘、可謂該業鼎盛時期、後至民國十六年、因受軍事影響、把船隻移搭浮橋、花舫便遭池魚之殃、又到杭江鐵路造成、遊客銳减、花船營業、更一落千丈、去秋還有船二十七隻、現在更已减至二十隻、每隻花舫、有靑年女子五六人、俗稱船娘、或「女船主」、（有「女招牌」之意）遊客上船小坐、欵待烟茶、可不化錢、若吃酒席、或令唱曲、或打麻將、往往揮霍甚鉅、可是究其實際、終與善良風化、大有妨碍、縣府曾擬嚴厲取締、惟恐舫戶和舫女、一時無法謀生、所以只好採取緩進政策、徐圖補救、目前各舫所有舫女、都山舫主以「養女」名義、從窮鄉僻壞、自小價買而來、表面生活、似乎是風花雪月的過着、實際所受的痛苦、却是人間的活地獄、此外上游銜縣、也有花舫、同受商業衰微的影響、都日益加深她們非人生活的悲運、</p>
<p>蘭谿沿江的那一排茶樓、因為建築在江岸邊、樓比街道還低七八磴、若去喝茶、與共說是上樓、勿寗說是下樓、遊客一下茶樓、躺上靠椅、此間特產的茶娘、（大約四五名）、就一擁而上、替你倒茶、替你剝瓜子、任意賣弄風騷、誘惑顧客、若茶客不止一人、她們更顯得特別的辛苦、好像走馬燈似的、來回輪着招應、假若客人要吃烟、她們還把火柴用魔術的手腕弄燃、飛快的點在你啣在口中的紙烟上、更藝術化的、就是剛好把碟底鋪了一層的瓜子、一粒不多、一粒不少、前兩碟不會吃完、後兩碟又雙雙送上、你一人畢竟吃得有限、但是遊串成羣的她們、却不客氣的連吃帶藏、不消一刻鐘、空碟便重疊成兩尊寶塔、可知僅此瓜子收入、為數已大可觀、何况小賬在外、據該縣商會某君談、如此茶樓、的在二百家左右、凡來遊的茶客、其閒情逸致、也不在茶、而在乎別一境界之間、茶娘也是鄉問的貧苦婦女、由茶樓雇用、月薪僅三四元、她們對於額外收入的希望很低、故一般冶遊子弟、一下茶樓、就像跌入樓外的大江、末由自拔的也極多、現縣府已設法改善、不准她們出樓接客或送客、所以「不准」云者、是因一接一送之間、還另有文章在、鄰縣的茶樓、如金華·龍游、江山等縣都早已受了蔓延之症、最近、衢縣發生一椿暗殺案、查與茶樓女侍有關、當地駐軍、因嚴令取締、一般茫茫然如喪家犬的茶樓之花、不得已乃紛紛逃往鄰縣、蘭谿是她們的發祥地、尤為衆望所歸、雖有金城湯池、莫之能禦也、</p>
<p>蘭谿金華各縣、還有「重男輕女」的惡俗、同時也是造成「船娘「茶娘」以及「土娼」的因素、一般中等人家、不願養過多的女孩、貧窮農戶、更不願養女孩、因此生了女孩、竟有處以野蠻手段的（縣府已早出佈吿禁止）或者暗地棄於富戶的門前、或者寫信通知育嬰所來收養、近幾年來、因為滬杭各埠雇請乳母的加多、此間棄兒棄女的、也更加多了、</p>
<p>特別是各鄕風氣不開、婚姻以金錢為重、貧家娶妻、俗稱比製田產還難、做父母的、為未雨綢繆計、也樂於養童養媳、童養媳的生活、大抵以出生數月、就抱送婆家、由翁姑自小養大的、待遇還較好、若年齡稍大、感情易有隔膜、看待的不好、至少定趕不及親生的兒女、普通把女兒抱給人家做童養媳、還要津貼上數十元生活補助費、甘肅西路的童養媳、的父母、以每歲一元的標準按年齡計收聘金、已覺很不近乎人情、而此間童養媳、還要由娘家倒貼生活費、更令人憤憤不平、蘭谿金華各鄉女兒、很僥倖地長大成人、得哭着坐上「父母之命、媒妁之言」交織成的大紅花轎、出嫁婆家的那些舊式禮節、也非常會令你頭昏、舉個例子、譬如娘家抱女兒上轎、母親雖然一把鼻涕一聲「兒啊兒」地哭訴着、說甚麽「脚踏樓梯步步高啊」、「早生貴子報娘恩啊」、但那時抱新娘的人、刦怕一不當心、使新娘的脚、踏着娘家的地皮、於娘家不利、為迎娶來的媒人轎夫等、縱在極冷的冬夜、連火也不准動一動、也怕對於娘家人財有傷、迷信矛盾如此、那裏還好說是嫁「人」、</p>
<p>還有把自己的妻子、出典給別人去生子、謂之「典妻」、這種將自己唯一的妻子、看做一部播種機器的惡俗、以舊處州（麗水）屬的靑田、和金區的東陽人最多、因為一般有財產無子嗣、又沒有娶妾可能的人、就異想天開向人家租妻生子、租價一次、躉付百十元、或分年各出數十元、租期三年五年、租妻住你家或住原夫家、却不一定、但在這時期內所生子女、所有權是屬於出錢典妻的、至於出典妻子的、可以由反面想到、大都是子女衆多、衣食不足的人家、雖說這是鄉土風俗所特許、然亦別有一番苦味在心頭也、現因交通發達、風氣漸開、上述各地惡俗、當然陸續將被取締淘汰了、</p>
<p>每一個地方盛行着的歌謠、通常會把那地方人民的思想習性、生活實况、充分而自然地流露出來、蘭谿各區鄕流行的歌謠也很多、選錄幾首如下、</p>
<p>（一）念歲姊嫁個七歲郎、日裏穿衣穿鞋送書房、夜裏脫鞋脫襪抱上床、睏在頭邊沒商量、睏了脚後又恐老鼠抱過牆、長長竹竿晒衣裳、短短竹竿做文章、不怪爺不怪娘、也不怪小郎、怪我自己命不祥、只得暗泣到天光、</p>
<p>（二）大麻雀、尾巴長、娶了媳婦忘了娘、早得兒子早得利、早娶媳婦早生氣、</p>
<p>（三）一個兒子提心吊膽、二個兒子錦上添花、三個兒子變成四家、多男多女多寃家、（這是實情但多是受遺產的毒）、一男一女一枝花、無男無女賽仙家、</p>
<p>（四）正月陪陪客、二月鏟鏟麥、三月餓一餓、四月有麥磨、五月苦一苦、六月米到肚、七月扇擋擋、八月戲唱唱、九月拖拖鞋、十月抓抓柴、十一月受受氣、十二月做皇帝、（這是農民一年生活狀况的速寫、但「做皇帝」不是過肥年、是「躱賬」的俗稱）、</p>
<p>（五）女兒親、不是親、全副嫁妝還嫌輕、兒子親、不是親、三句說話面朝西、夫妻親、不是親、同牀合被兩條心、兄弟親、不是親、一碗送來一碗請、只有銅鈿銀子嫡嫡親、要來用來就動身、</p>
<p>（六）三人一樣心、到處出黃金、（合作之效如此、莫笑老農無知、</p>

<h3>本市　私貨漸絕</h3>
<p>當局嚴緝南來不易　走私奸商賠累頗多</p>
<p>申時社云、華北走私之風、自財政部飭關嚴緝、並於平漢。津浦各路沿綫、組設緝私稽查分處、撥派關員分段查緝以來、雖私貨南運未絕、然亦漸趨末路、記者頃自商界探悉、華北走私貨物、本埠方面、近來已甚少見、蓋走私商人、自去年大量由海陸各路輸入各項貨物、屯積頗夥、現以查緝嚴密、銷路停滯、在事實上早已供過於求、已往雖有人造絲白糖及捲菸紙等進口、但商人對於此項貨物、大多未願購進、故其出路甚微、走私商人、賠累頗多、已吿無法支特、同時華北走私情形、亦已漸入不支狀態、蓋走私浪人、牟利心重、自受當局嚴緝查扣影響後、組織已陷散漫、近聞私貨南運、大半多走海路、但於徐州·濟南·靑島·等地、已無法銷售、故皆輾轉設法、運往陝西等處貶價求脫、南來京滬、實屬不易、因此本埠私貨、漸將絕跡矣、預料將來海關緝私總稽查處、於北寗路沿綫稽查分處組織成立、將冀東一路私貨截住後、華北走私、不久可告消滅、</p>

<h3>財政部規定人造絲等　土貨疋頭稽查辦法　海關定期限各廠報請查核購用人造絲應取海關稅據</h3>
<p>申時社云、財政部為防止進口人造絲、及人造絲疋頭走私、前曾規定在稽查之列、惟國內工廠、亦有製造之人造絲疋頭、則未經規定稽查、茲為防止奸商利用、以免妨碍防止私運人造絲進口之功効起見、持規定各工廠所購人造絲及用人造絲或攙用人造絲織成士貨疋頭之稽查及淸理辦法九項、茲探錄如下、</p>
<p>報關清理　發運銷照</p>
<p>（一）所有各工廠用人造絲　或攙用人造絲織成之土貨疋頭、亦應按照進口貨物暫行章程、一體稽查、凡工廠所製之前項疋頭、無照運銷者、應照稽查進口貨物暫行章程第八條之規定辦理、（二）由海關規定淸理各工廠存貨期限、（三）工廠應遵照海關所定淸理存貨期限以內、將存貨數量、報吿海關、附具同業公會證書、由海關派員赴廠查核登記、（四）所存登記之積存疋頭、准予免繳稅證、發給運銷執照、（五）所有登記積存之人造絲、應由工廠提出納稅證明、如無納稅證明者、由海關規定期限、責令在期限內、向原進口海關請頒納稅證明文伴繳騐、該項存貨人造絲、得由海關暫行封存、如逾期仍無海關證明納稅文件繳騐者、各該工廠應卽按照進口稅則、補納稅欵、免予處罰沒收、</p>

<h3>與所得稅　相同捐稅</h3>
<p>須一律裁撤　庶免民衆疑慮</p>

<h3>粵改大洋制擱淺後　唐海安已返滬</h3>
<p>華東社云、中央政府為謀統一幣制起見、曾派財政部高等顧問兼江海關監督唐海安氏、再度南下、詳詢一切、嗣因粵省對白銀移送中央保管問題、難以辦到、故唐氏此行、毫無結果、茲悉唐氏業於前日乘坐大來公司之林肯總統號輪由港返滬、並悉唐氏俟謁孔財長、報吿南行經過後、卽行銷假視事至於交通銀行唐壽民、中國銀行上海分行經理貝祖貽兩氏，現亦决定中止南下、</p>

<h3>本屆奧林匹克足球賽　現有十國參加　英格蘭雖尙未報名但已預備參加　荷蘭因球員薪金損失問題難解决</h3>
<p>（柏林通訊）足球——「球類之王」——在奧林匹克世運會之歷史、實較他種運動更多變遷、自一九〇八年起、卽被列入為世運項目之一、迨一九二八年、世運在荷蘭亞姆斯丹特舉行時、對於足球隊有無違反奧林匹克業餘規則、各國意見紛歧、以致涉及整個足球參加世運問題、爭議甚烈、殊難解决、最後反對派佔得勝利、故於一九三二年十屆世運在美國洛杉磯舉行時、取消足球比賽項目、但一九三四年秋、在羅馬召集之國際足球協會中議决足球仍列入為世運節目、俾各國足球代表隊參加角逐、此項議决案、並非與上次因業餘問題而取消參加之原意相抵觸、全為奧會本身增加興趣故也、本年夏在柏林舉行之世運會將實行該項議决案、而增設足球比賽、現加入者甚多、</p>
<p>本屆世運足球比賽項目、參加者巳有二十國、報名手續早已辦妥、但素以足球著稱之英格蘭、尙無動靜、足球在英最為普遍、故此項英格蘭是否參加、世人均引為重大問題、而加以注意、按一九〇八年在倫頓及一九一二年在斯篤克霍倫舉行之四五兩屆世運會、足球錦標均為英格蘭獲得、在巴黎及亞姆斯丹特舉行之八九兩屆世運、英格蘭未曾參加、至本屆參加柏林世運之主張、實出於柯郎國際裁判員包溫博士、業已書面提出預備參加、同時向英最佳之業餘隊、徵求意見、日內卽可作最後决定、茲從倫頓傳出消息、英當可組織一堅强之足球隊參加本屆世運云、</p>
<p>荷蘭是否派足球隊參加世運、亦為荷蘭體育界一嚴重之問題、衆意荷蘭皇家足球協會當將組織一隊參加、蓋荷蘭為足球第一流之國家、故荷蘭之不派足球隊、寶與美芬之不派田徑隊相同也、惟足球員因參加世運而受薪金時之損失如何補救問題一時尙難解决、現正儘力設法中、最近荷蘭旅行社、已購就世運門券一千張、以應一千觀衆於荷蘭足球隊出戰之日或前一日前往參觀、於此可見荷蘭對於足球之熱忱、當然無人破壞此次參加之正當希望云、</p>
<h3>國際游泳下月八日舉行</h3>
<p>節目十項水球表演或將改為競賽　中華隊廿五日預選日內開始報名</p>

<h3>升學就業指導的基本工作（下）</h3>
<p>— 何清</p>
<p>一、調查學生個人狀况我們在前面已經的略的提到、學生個人的狀况、是各個不同的、在淺近的方面、如年齡·性別·籟貫等不同、不必具論、在更重要的方面、如普通智力、特殊能力、學業成續、體格狀態、課外活動、志願興趣、家庭環境上、亦是各有差別、這些差別對於所發生的問題、都有不同的影響、除這些狀况以外、個人的問題亦包括在內、因為升學問題與就業問題應分辨、並且升學問題或就業問題內容、亦還可再分析、</p>
<p>調查學生狀况既包含道些事項、决不是短時間內所可完成的、特別是在人數衆多的學校裏、必須在平日的時候、隨時舉行、最好能在最後一年之內、因為時間如過長、到了應用的時候、能失時效、而變為不準確、這秤調查當然要採用規定的表格、確實的進行、所要得的材料、有的是學生個人能供給的、有的是需由各方面微集的、</p>
<p>微集材料雖可由多方面入手、但這種調查必集中主持、由指定負責指導規劃進行、校中的敎職員對於調查工作都應恊助合作、但若沒有專人負責、必不能繼續進行、得圓滿結果、有了調查、然後在實施指導的時候、方有確實的根據、所擬的解决方案、方能發生效力、所以這種調查、是指導中基本工作的一種、</p>
<p>二、搜集學校及職業材料無論解决何種指導問題、除對於個人的狀况應明瞭淸楚、以作根據外、對於問題有關的事業材料、亦要搜集完備、升學問題必有各高級學校（大學）的章程一覽、或其他材料、作參考、就業問題必須有關於職業內容、需要、及機會的調查、這兩種材料都有基本的重要、並且亦都不是在短時間內卽可完備的、必須平常隨時徵求、方可充足、關於學校的參考材料、自然以與本校學生有相當關係的為限、至於關於職業的參考、更應以與本校學生本地社會、有關係的為範圍、二者都不是廣泛普遍的、所以未必是各地學校都相同的、至於搜集調查、有的材料是需各校單獨舉行的、有的是可以數校合作的、亦有的是已經有別的機關曾有相當的調查、可以便利採用的、應如何進行、是要按照情形决定的、無論如何進行、在一個實施指導的學校中、必有專人負責計劃·整理·保存·各種的調查村料、這部工作與調查個人狀况的主持工作、同樣重要、由一人担任亦可、因為這兩方而的調查工作、以及其他指導工作、都需要長時問的精力、所以最好有職業指導的專仟職員、免得附帶的加在別的敎職員身上、不能有充足的照顧，</p>
<p>三、實施個別指導、調查了學生狀况以後、不是將調查的結果都保存起來卽算了事調查的目的是在作指導的根據、所以指導是一種方法、一步過程、並非至終的目的、在調查的時候既是發現了個人的問題、然後卽應按照個人的問題、參照一切有關的材料、施行實際的指導、無論升學或就業問題、必須切實的個別指導、方可希望得到解所謂個別指導、卽由負責指導的人與學生舉行個別談話、討論學生的問題、供給有關的參考、建議處置的方案、這種個別談話、最好集中由專員負賣指導責任的担任、但有時亦需其他敎職員的協助、此種談話不限一次、次數的多寡、按問題性質而定、决不能固定每人一次、每次幾分鐘、必須按個人情形而伸縮、</p>
<p>個別指導雖應由專人負責、但所施的指導常須根據各方的參考、關於修學或升學的計劃有時應諮詢有關的敎師、關於經濟狀况及家庭環境、當徵求家長的報吿、關於健康的情形應參考醫士的意見、其他與問題有關的各方面、亦有時應徵求建議、所以負責指導的應成為指導的中樞、綜合各方的意見、實施處置的方法、並非草率·武斷·簡單的工作、亦决不是臨時或最後可以完成的、</p>
<p>四、聯絡校外的各方面無論升學或就業問題、學生都是要與校外的各方面發生關係、而以就業問題為更甚、升學的學生、要與高級的學校發生關係、如果負責指導校能與各學校有相當的聯絡、或是請各校負責人來校演講、或的定使本校學生赴各的參觀、或有別種接洽、都可對學生有許多便利的地方、至於就業的學生、極需職業機會、這種機會、必須由學生與社會中各種機關有相當聯絡、方可產生、</p>
<p>聯絡的一個重要目的、卽將本校的成續表示出來、對升學的各學校、對就業的各機關、一個學校必須能表示出來能供獻的地方、方能引起合作的可能、這種宣傳、自然應根據事實、假若學校成績惡劣、社會自然不肯合作、學生的出路必感覺困難、所以與各方聯絡亦不是空洞的交往、虛僞的應酬、乃是根據成績、謀求合作、</p>
<p>聯絡的工作亦是應有專人負責的、不是可以任意委托何人都可以的、負指導責任的、固然亦可以担任這部工作、但如因別的工作過繁、或有別種不方便的原因、亦可另外有人負責、由學校的領袖担任比較最為適宜、因為地位的關係、有許多方便的地方、無論由何人担任、總應以這種工作為指導的一個正式的部分、</p>
<p>以上四種工作、我們認為是中等學校實施升學或就業指導最基本的工作、如果道幾項能完全切實的施行、卽沒有別的工作、亦可使指導有很好的效果、由這幾種工作、我們可以看出指導是敎育一部分、應該平日施行、並着重在個別指導的、如果能認淸這些工作、對於指導的不正確觀念、亦可消除、</p>
<p>但這些工作都有共同的先决條件、卽無論何部工作、都應有專人負責、亦可說要辦理升學就業指導、必需有專人計劃施行、然後方可行的得當，有充實的效果，沒有專人、這種事業無所寄托、卽等於虛設、所以有意施行升學或就業指導的、要認淸這種工作的重要性及長遠性、將這種工作交托負責的人計劃施行、然後我們可希望這種事業的發展、學生可多得到實益、（完）</p>

<h3>日人統制下之華北紡織業</h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>最近關於中國棉紡織業衰落的消息，眞是報不絕書。根據上個月（六月）統計，全國華商紗廠現有紗錠的二百七十餘萬枚，綫錠十四萬餘枚，布機二萬餘架；但紗錠有三一·五％是在停工中，而不停工的六八·五％，則有一二·四％實行减工，一〇％卽將减工。至綫錠和布機，在停滯中的自然也不在少數。這較之去年最惡劣的一年，還更惡劣得多多。</p>
<p>可是，當華商廠家正在紛紛倒閉，出賣停工减工之際；相反的，在華日本資本所經營的紗廠，却不斷的在進行收買，添廠，加錠，增工，獲有驚人的發展。只就眼前紗錠而論，聞巳達二百四十五萬餘枚之巨，比去年的一百九十四萬枚，又增加了五十萬多；而將要增加的，尙不計在內。</p>
<p>日資對於棉紡織業的活動，雖仍舊不會放棄滬漢各地，但顯然已側重於華北，這和畸形的政治勢力的發展，實有不可分離的密按關係；根本，這也是所謂「經濟提携」下侵略政策之一啊！</p>
<p>日商紗廠之積極轉向於華北者，尙開始於去年，去年日商在華共增設三廠，都集中於靑島一隅，計：</p>
<p>本年初，日本豐田自動機械會社復向華商在靑島僅有的華新紗廠實行變相的投資，名義上雖然是裝換新式機器，但實際上又何異於華廠對日資的屈服。所以，靑島紡織業可謂全部都握在日商的手裏了。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，本年內日商更注重於天津，因為天津是中國工商業要區，經營上可以便利得多。同時，津市既受轄於冀察政委會，又鄰近冀東偽自治區域，直接間接都處於日方政治勢力之下，可把經濟侵略和政治侵略連在同一條綫。他們不僅着眼於華北為止，且進而預備將天津成為壟斷全中國紗菜的中心地。</p>
<p>日商紗廠對於天津的進出是採取下列三種方式：（一）收買華廠，（二）擴充舊廠，（三）添設新廠。在收買華廠的策略之下，天津現有各廠，遂絡繹落在日本資本的手中了。茲將當地華商各紗廠現狀略述於下：</p>
<p>裕元　這是天津最大的紗廠，成立於民國七年四月，資本五百六十萬元。內部分第一第二第三三紗廠及織布廠，共有紗錠七萬一千三百六十枚，綫錠九日七十六枚，布機一千架，工人達三千名。因近年營業不振，絡繹有所虧欠，遂於去年一月十一日宣吿停工。截至去年止，共欠中日債團的担保債務五百十七萬元之鉅，其中日商大倉洋行借欵日金三百三十餘萬，佔百分之六十以上。此外，尙有股票三百萬也流入日人手裏。由於大倉洋行催還欠欵的緊急，以及日方持股人從中作崇，乃不得不清算出賣。日商對於這個紗廠是早已存心吞沒的，其所以貸欵收股者，實係侵吞過程中的手段。經長久醞釀結果，裕元紗廠終於在本年五月間正式為日本鐘紡織社所收買。目前正積極改裝機器的設備，預定九月開工，開工後擬擴充為十五萬錠。旦除紡細紗外，並將從事織造棉布。至名稱方面，大致將改為公大六廠。從此，津市最大的紗廠是落在日資的懷抱中了；而民族工業中一個重要的鬥士，便喪失了它最後的命運！</p>
<p>北洋　資本三百九十萬元，共有紗錠二寓六千七百五十二枚，綫錠二千一百二十八枚，工人一千三百餘名，每日產量的六十餘包。由於虧累過巨，去年六月間曾一度停工，旋增資二十萬，改組復工，但最近卒因無力掙扎，又復宣布破產。到了上月（六月）間，該廠也被日資所收買，接辦者為上海裕豐紗廠。（編者按本報十七日津電有云，北洋六廠，祗餘恒源北洋三家，歸華人管業云：）</p>
<p>寶成　資本三百萬元，共有紗錠二萬七千零二十八枚，綫錠二千五百二十枚，工人一千二百名，每日產量的五十三包。該廠出品本來大都運銷於東北，自從東北失陷後，市塲中絕，致虧負日巨，無法繼續維持，至七月十七日由債權銀行團拍賣，卽由裕大紗廠之大倉鐘紡織社以一百三十七萬五千元的代價，正式歸入到日商名下了。</p>
<p>華新　資本二百四十二萬餘元，共有紗錠數二萬七千零七十二枚，工人一千名。該廠機器及衛生設備等都為各廠之冠。不幸，為了營業的衰退，最近內部股東互鬧意見很深，據本月十六日申報所載，有跟裕元，北洋，寶成出賣之勢；同時，日方虎視耽耽，聞大日本紡織會社，也正在籌劃接辦，不久的將來，恐怕這個華新紗廠又是靠不住的了。</p>
<p>恒源　資本四百萬元，原有紗錠三寓五千四百四十枚，綫錠二千五百四十枚，布機三百十架，因營業虧耗，負債達百餘萬元，二十三年間宣告停業。當時曾盛傳將由日本東拓公司接辦的消息；幸而沒有成為事實，現由中國中南金城鹽業四行合組的誠孚信託公司經理，擬增紗錠二萬餘枚，布機四百架，預備每日出紗一百餘包，出布一千四百疋。但是，它的前途我們仍舊不能充分樂觀，在日方重重壓迫之下，狠希望不蹈如前述數廠的覆轍，殊覺很難担保</p>
<p>達生　成立於民國二十一年，初僅撚綫，去年才開始紡紗，資本二十萬元，共有紗錠五千枚，工人四百名，每月出紗約三百包。該廠因範圍很小，所以很多人不予注意，然而，由於新近成立的關係，所用各種機器都屬新式，生產效率較高，生產費用較少，似乎很有發展的希望。不過，日方對於這個後起之秀恐怕不會多大留情的在華北這樣的畸形局面之下，我們仍不得不懷着無限的隱憂。</p>
<p>綜觀以上六家紗廠，達在係新近成立，舊廠之碩果僅存者，只銀團經營的恒源一家而已；裕元，北洋（？）寶成三家已被日資收買，華新也在危殆中。如連同早在日商手中的裕大，（資本三百萬，紗錠三萬五千七百十二枚，錢錠一千五百枚）在內，則天津紡織業的絕大部分勢力，實被日方所把住。這裏，可以再來一個簡單的比較：</p>
<p>上表所列，天津紗廠中資本方面日方將佔</p>
<p>八一·二％，華方一八·八％紗錠日方將佔八　。三％，華方一七·七％，綫錠日方將佔七三·七％，華方二六·三％，這些比率已經够足驚人了；然而還不止此，日商對於上列各廠且又積極擴展，裕大紗廠在大日本紡織會社支持之下，擬擴充至五萬錠，裕元紗廠則在鐘紡織社支持之下，擬擴充如十五萬錠。此外，鐘紡織社又進行在津設立裕豐分廠，預定紗錠十萬枚，東洋紡織會社新設紗廠巳於日前舉行奠基典禮，本年底可以竣工，將來的有紗錠十五萬枚。同時，大日本紡織會社，金籘紡織會社，東洋紡織會社擬採取生產合作制度，共同建築能容十五萬紗錠的大工廠。又，東洋紡織會社，大阪紡織會社，鐘紡織社也有合資設立新廠的消息，第一步計劃配裝紗錠五萬錠，第二步計劃明年內完成十萬錠。聞日商已一致議定，津市至少預備增設紗錠六十萬枚，那末合上表二十萬枚許，僅天津一埠將達八十萬枚之巨了，日本所欲統制華北紡織市塲的志願，可云完全達到了。</p>
<p>除靑島天津以外，輩北華商紗廠在別的地方自然也很難立足的。譬如，具有二萬八千紗錠的唐山華新分廠，在冀東僞組織種種摧殘及二重捐稅負担之下，不啻已處於風燭的境地。至於冀魯晋其他各廠，也都掙扎於深重的壓迫而岌岌可危。且不僅華北為然，整個國內的紡織業都有總崩潰的危機；再加走私盛行，大量棉布氾濫各地，織布業的生路，益形遭遇了致命的摧折。</p>
<p>復次，日方對於原棉的壟斷，又無所不用其極，在所謂「工業日本，農業中國」的口號之下，華北的棉產將盡被掠取。計冀魯晋三省棉田面積的佔全國棉田總面積百分之三十三，產額的佔全國總產額的百分之三十五，平均每年大的可產五百萬擔左右。復在日本政府和滿鐵會社方面整個侵略程序曁以鐘紡織社，及東洋紡織會社為中心的「華北棉花五年計畫」之下，預偕更積極擴大華北棉田，改良種籽，先着重於冀東和魯東，次及山西，甚且延至陝豫諸省。務達華北成為日本紡織業之無限制的原棉供給地，華北農民一輩子成為植棉的奴隸而後止；俾華日本所用棉花不再仰結於由美國印度埃及的輸入。</p>
<p>所以，不僅紗布的產銷受日方壟斷，卽原棉的供給，也被無理的鉗制了；此後，棉紡織業的一切，都將由日本資本所操縱，而中國唯一的民族工業，也就有全部夭亡的危險性！</p>
<p>據榮宗敬氏說，受日商紗廠出品傾銷的影響，華商在現時製紗，巳經每包須虧損七八角每件須蝕三十元；如不及時挽救，到將來恐怕卽使想蝕本也不可能了！那末，怎樣挽救呢？我們也曾經聽到過政府進行敎濟，銀行界進行援助，但直到現在却仍舊都是空中樓閣。據本月十日中華日報載稱，曾有記者向榮宗敬氏詢及紗廠呈請實業部救濟的事情，榮氏的回答是這樣：「此說高唱巳屆三年，而於事實則百無一補！」這是多麽悲痛的嘆聲呀！另外，在五月初我們曾見中國銀行之領導合組紡織業經營聯合會，救濟華北紡織業，並在鄭州舉行會議，議定關於採花紡紗售價曾辦法，當時似乎給華北紡織業露示了一綫的曙光，然而，事隔兩月有餘，竟聽不到有怎樣具體的下文！</p>
<p>本來，中國棉紡織業的衰落，决不是簡單的所謂「市面不景氣」問題而已，它是某方政治經濟侵略下必然的結果。所以，縱使上述的「救濟」辦得好，也僅屬治標於極短的一時，絕非澈底的對策。我們要牢記「經濟提携」「工業××農業中國」所內含着的火藥的氣味，怎樣把中國脫離殖民地或半殖民地的桎梏，才是我們根本的出路！</p>
<h3>走私問題</h3>
<p>— 王海帆</p>
<p>我國走私一事，由來巳久。凡洞悉滬上商情而於其內慕有相當認識者，莫不知人造絲捲烟紙中有所謂白貨紅貨其名，此項術語，卽官貨與私貨之代名詞也，每年關稅損失，雖無從統計，殆亦可觀。惟據聞此中人亦有相當組織，且有茶會，有市價，凡私貨之來自某方，有祗將貨物送至海口而止，有保裝至登陸者，亦有代理轉運擔保一切危險而送至若輩之推銷塲所者，要皆漢奸與浪人相通，藉外力之庇護，以掩蔽關務人員之耳目而成。至私貨之一經登陸而至推銷機關以後，則萬無一失，卽轉運內地，所有納稅之「派司」，可以頂替冒用，以是「白貨」無異於「紅貨」矣。此向日走私之概况，究其事實是否如此，固非局外人所得而知也。及華北走私猖獗，深入內地，有以為是乃關稅過高所致。如羅斯歸國時之談話，以减低稅率為言，殊不知我國之稅率，論其大體，尙較英美德法日諸國為低。吾人知一國之進口稅則，在不違反最惠國條欵下，固有自由訂定之權。卽稅率較高，日本商人自應依照條約規定，遵守中國之海關條例，亦不能以是而實施走私漏稅，肆行無忌也。且據近日海關調查所得，關於走私貨物，猶非限於價貴稅高之人造絲曾而已，如各種水果海產之類，走私亦多，果爾則走私之促成，决非稅率之過高明矣。</p>
<p>然則其主因果安在乎？其一，因日本商品之急謀出路也。蓋自覇估東北四省後，工業日盛，去歲以侵略地擴大，意阿戰爭之特殊機會，對外貿易竟成新紀錄。今歲自一月以降，第一季入超總額達二萬萬一千五百餘萬元，較之上年同期入超增五千三餘萬元。但輸出則終未能相與並增，計其比率，輸出額較上年同期增加百分之四，輸入額則較上年同期增加百分之九，在此情勢之下，日人不得不急謀市塲之擴展。然環顧各國正惶惶終日，皆以一九三六年為非常時期，競高唱自給政策，漸趨於戰時統制經濟之際，自由貿易，不易得現於今日。而遠東經濟集團之夢想，又豈能實行，因此而欲促成其目的，遂不惜容縱其出於走私之一途</p>
<p>其二，擾亂金融，本為侵略者政策之一。走私問題，殆如五月十八日倫敦太晤字報之言曰，「此事不僅為日本軍人局部之行為，……」證之去歲一月至五月間，華北時有私運銀幣緝獲，此時海道走私尙未擴大，何以日方竟提出要求，對於我國海關緝私艦不能在戰區使行職務？何以同時沿長城一帶緝私人員，亦被解除武裝？俾不法之徒，日益橫行。且中經我方數度提請協助，何以互相推諉，卽置若罔聞？此後我國外交部曾提出嚴重抗議，何以至今絕無結果？再如英美諸國以自身利害關係，皆曾正式向日政府責問，何以始終未得要領？由此以觀，情跡顯然。雖然，彼欲破壞我金融，搖動我市塲，其處心積慮，已非一日。當去歲我國實施法幣之前後，其先思挾巨額紙幣，冀造成擠兌之恐怖局面。其後滬地日商有議請用日幣於中國市塲，以逞其擾亂之陰謀，事雖未見諸實行，使其計得售，為禍之烈，將甚於走私也。抑有進者，今日之走私，情形已大非往昔之偷漏可比，海道則舳鱸相接，滿載以行；陸路則逐客裝貨，鐵路之交通為阻。彼主其事者，設有大規模之貿易協會等浪人組合。若無背景，何敎橫行若是耶！</p>
<p>時賢之論防止走私漏稅者，不外獎勵吿密，從嚴緝私。顧今日政府所頒之懲治條例對於漏稅之罪，千元以上卽須無期徒刑，重者處以死刑，禁令不為不重。對於給獎辦法，凡通風報信因而拿獲處分，卽有五成之賞，獎勵不為不厚。然而私貨竟源源不絕，橫行市塲，大有方與未艾之勢。緝私則遭遇阻礙，致毆傷侮辱，日有所聞。時至今日，事態已日趨惡化，影響所及，國家稅收既日短，工商業亦岌岌可危，吾人對此嚴重問題，其有何策以處置之乎？獎勵吿密，從嚴緝私，在今日環境之下，能有濟乎？至若求日人諒解，予以協助，其勢有所不能。他如稅率之應否修改，吾人巳知决非走私　結所在，彼羅斯爵士之言，好意睢屬，吾政府當自有主張，深恐果從其言，走私未巳，而國家損失益巨。為今之計，在積極方面，除以實力調整華北特殊地位，以謀澈底之功外，別無良策。在消極方面，商人當感切身之痛，嚴密自身組織，檢舉私貨，制裁漢奸，俾私貨去路既無，來路自絕。前者主動在政府，而人民為後盾。後者主動在人民，而政府為後盾。誠如是，或可收有效於萬一。若再事因循，不籌有效對策，徒以稅收不足，另謀開源之道，則人民貪圖私利，寗有已時，是則後息之來，恐有甚於洪水猛獸矣。</p>
<h3>國產檢驗之商榷</h3>
<p>— 辛之</p>
<p>—關於「人民自動辦理」問題—</p>
<p>在過去，我們已有過許多慘痛的經騐，便是本意原是很好的改進事業，所得的結果往往相反，最近實業部舉辦國產檢騐，卽是站在這樣的歧路中。</p>
<p>國產檢騐的本意，不但是農業改進事業之一種，而且為今日的當務之急。國產檢騐的主體是產地檢騐，在工業尙不十分發達，農業仍佔國民經濟重要地位的今日中國，所謂國產，自然乃以農產為主。是故國產檢騐在狹義的解說上，也可稱為農產物的產地檢騐。農產物為什麼要受產地檢騐，理由至為明顯：第一，中國今日的各種農產，品質太雜，檢騐足以消極的促進生產之改進，第二，保障品質之優良，並鑑定品質之等級，有助於賣買之進行：第三，取締攙僞作假之惡習，提高產品之聲譽。今日中國的農業生產關係，至為複雜，國產檢騐合理的進行，除了努力於改進農產品質以外，不但是應顧到商民的利益，而且更須要顧到農民的利益。</p>
<p>中國進出口商品的檢騐行政，巳有多年的歷史，而以內銷商品為主的國產檢騐，還見創舉，草創之始，自必少不得要參考一些先進國家實施的成効。</p>
<p>可先以日本的情形來說。日本檢政的背景：是全國領土不大，社會各部門的機構，不但組織化，而且統一。在這樣有利的條件下，似乎檢騐工作易於推行，且可由「人民自動辦理」了？但日本的檢騐行政，還見煞費苦心。</p>
<p>日本的檢騐工作分兩種，一種是工業品的檢騐，一種是農業品的檢騐。工業品檢騐，可說是由「人民自動辦理的，」但亦會經過重要的改革。日本工業品檢騐機關都是各當業的「工業組合」，這工業組合，如我們視為這與吾國的同業公會性質完全一樣，那就完全錯誤，僅可說，相當於吾國今日同業公會，在日本卽是「同業組合」，因為日本人的組織力强，在若干塲合，比較吾國今日的同業公會有組織，有力量得多多。自從一九二九年後，世界經濟恐慌發生，各國貿易戰爭激化，日本政府知道要應付當前的經濟戰爭，卽非改進日貨品質，同時减低成本不可，用以達到這目的的方法，卽所謂「人民自主統制」。執行這種「自主統制」的機關最適宜的似乎是同業組合了。但是，日本政府還以好同業組合力量不足，而另外頒佈工業組合法，使各同業自動組織工業組合，執行：（一）積極的生產互助，（二）消極的檢騐及統制（如價格等）兩大工作。</p>
<p>但這祗見工業部門情形，農產部門完全不同。日本的所謂「自主統制」（自動檢騐在內），是以商品生產者本身為限的，故祗有工業品為可能。農產品的直接生產者為分散的小農（日本尙保持着零碎地的小農經營），這些農民，文化尙很落後，要他們自動來檢騐自己的農產，自屬不可能，故農產物的檢騐，純粹是政府的工作。</p>
<p>日本農產檢騐是地方政府的工作之一部份，因為農業生產分散各地，各地情形不同，自非各就特殊情形，分別辦理不可。故日本農產檢騐各縣不同，檢騐的種煩亦有差別，各地的農會及「檢查組合」等人民團體，祗站在輔助地位（詳情參閱上流商品檢騐局出版日本農產物檢騐調查報吿）</p>
<p>美國的農產物檢騐，亦是一樣，都是由政府辦理。（同上出版國際貿易導報第六卷第九號）</p>
<p>看了這些參考，再來看中國農產檢騐的辦法。</p>
<p>實業部國產檢騐委員會於本年（二十五年）四月二十四日第二次會議中議决「國產檢騐制度基本原則」六條：</p>
<p>一，由取締攙雜作僞入手，以鑑定品級為目的。</p>
<p>二先由政府提倡，希望逐漸由人民自動辦理，由政府監督指導，但檢騐方法及分級標準均須呈經本部（實業部）核定，其檢騐人員並須經本部主管檢騐機關之認可。</p>
<p>三，國產內銷檢騐，應先由集散市塲或起邋地着手。</p>
<p>四，政府辦理國產內銷檢騐免取手續費。</p>
<p>五，國產內銷檢騐所需採取之樣品，騐畢槪予發還。</p>
<p>六，檢騐手續力求簡便，並嚴訂檢騐時間之限制，以便商運。</p>
<p>以這六條原則來說，不能說顧慮不週詳。但以第二條言，如不予以嚴格規定，實難免為使國產檢騐走人歧路之主因。在議决案經費支配上規定：「商人團體自辦者，由各該團體自行酌籌辦理，」更足引檢騐入於歧途。雖各項國產檢騐施行細則，是分別規定的，但這六項原則，自必一概適用。</p>
<p>首先我們要研究的是：所謂人民自動辦理，究竟那一種「人民」，根據「自動」兩字來說，自然是各業的當業者，如電燈泡製造業者之檢騐電燈泡，綿布製造業者之檢騐棉布業是。這種性質所能適用的，自然祗限於工業品部門，如農產品亦是「由人民自動辦理」，則祗有直接生產者農民自身才有資格。</p>
<p>卽先以工業品來說。要達到人民自動檢騐的目的，必須人民先有完密而强有力的組織，而這種組織，又須是純粹當業者自動。足以負担起這種責任的組織，今日還沒有。今日中國工商業者的組織，最重要的是各地商會及同業公會。商會內所包含的份子，龐雜之至，祗有在過去工業不發達的時候，社會上階層仍三大類：直接生產者農民，販賣者商人，以及治理者政府；祗有在這樣時候，商會才是惟一的人民團體。到了現在，生產者的工業家與純然販賣者的商人利益卽已不同，工作亦更歧異，如最近胡西園氏的呈請頒佈工業會法，便見這種事實的表現。再以現有商會內部情形來說，大部固談不到有力，也談不到組織完密，致有索賄舞弊執委潛逃等事情發生。加以根本上，商會不見「當業者」，自必更無「自動辦理」之可言。</p>
<p>比較適合當業者的組織這個條件的是同業公會。但是今日中國的同業公會也並不是可以負担這種責任的：第一，今日許多同業工業中，大部份不是工業生產者的組織，而是販賣商的組織，他們自然談不到「自動辦理」，假如他們可以「自動辦理」的話，則「被」動辦理的不是他們自巳出品，而是別人，結果是他們越權干涉別人，「自動」的功能喪失無遺。第二，就是有若干是工業生產者的組織，但這種同業公會還是脫不了過去工業基爾特（行會）的殘餘，甚或根本祗是一種俱樂部似的東西。如最近走私風潮發生，各方重視同業公會發揮力量，結果，是使馬寅初氏等得到改組並增强同業公會的結論。</p>
<p>所以，以工業品而論，由人民自動辦理檢騐是可以的，但必須先有能負得起這種責任的組織，政府對於這種組織並能絕對控制。日本在公佈工業組合未能以前，所有同業組合之力量與組織，恐較中國現有的，不知要高出多少，但日本政府以為還不夠，而重新頒佈工業組合法，把工業品自動檢騐之　，授之於各業的工業組合。</p>
<p>我們知道中國國產檢騐的問題不在於工業品，而在於農產，國產檢騐的主體，事實上也祇是農產物檢騐。如農產物檢騐要適用「基本原則」的第二條，則祇有直接生產者的農民自已，才有資格，但我們明知散漫的各個小農本身，是怎樣也不會有力量來「自動辦理」的。如一定可由他們自動辦現的話，那末，在產地必然是土豪劣紳，假借農民名義，成立團體，包辦檢騐，在「集散地」，必定是商業資本者，僭以「當業者」名義，「自動」的去給農民檢騐，這樣，政府原意避免多立機關，結果是紳商替政府多立了機關，不但不能達到政府之原意，而其為禍之烈，是不堪設想的。因為誰都可以利用「基本原則」第二條為藉口，盡量的組織團體，來替農民檢騐，更可以「自行籌欵」的議案為護符，而增加對農民的剝削。</p>
<p>這不是危言聳聽，國產檢騐委員會議决案公佈不久，豪紳市儈巳聞風蜂起，紛紛組織團體，來給政府「代勞」。</p>
<p>農產檢騐由人民辦理，在各國並無先例可循，以中國實際情形言之，更必會流弊叢生。何則？如前所述，農民既不能「自動」辦理，由商人來辦理，卽已失却了當業者「自動」的功效，而且，以中國農村中實際情形論，商人多與農民站在利益相反的地位，各種農產中攙僞作弊最多的，也都是中間販賣商人，以販賣者的商民，來檢騐農產物，無論政府監督的力量是怎樣的强，對於農民也是無益的。</p>
<p>我們認為農產物檢騐的「人民自動辦理」，現尙非其時！如政府有心使檢騐工作，由人民自至，則事先不但要先經過一種組織的工作，而政府的按制力量，亦必定要特別加强。否則，如檢騐權落入農村豪紳市儈之手，則未免又是「本益原是很好的改進事業，所得的結果往往相反」了。</p>
<h3>小麥檢騐辦法</h3>
<p>— 惜</p>
<p>小麥為我國民食大宗，近年來因災禍頻仍，與人口增加之故，遂呈不足之現象。上年度外麥輸入量，幾佔輸入品中之首位。在此民生與經濟交相困之中，如何增加生產，以豐富國內食糧之供給，如何勵行統制，以平衡各地食糧之盈虧。而施行檢查事業，在消極方面，可以防止攙雜作僞並减損；積極方面，可以提高品質及便利運銷與貯藏。直接可使生產者販賣者及消費者三方面之利益增加，間接可以助長農村。振與各種產業發達，以使國民生活之安定。故各國對於食糧檢查，莫不視為要政，良有以也。</p>
<p>小麥檢查之重要，巳述於前矣。但此種事業，在我國尚屬創舉，究應採用何種方針，其步驟若何，此實為實施檢查之先决問題。為謀推行之便利，與收效之宏大，尤不可不愼重考慮者。茲總核各方意見。僉以為小麥檢查步驟，應從攙水攙雜取締着手，次及品級，再次為品質，不知就中國實際情形而論，小麥之取締，似應從簡單分級做起也。</p>
<p>考檢查事業之目的有（一）改善生產物之品位，（二）保證及統一產物之品質數量，（三）改良買賣之方法，（四）使貯藏或保管之合理化，乃為穀物改良設施檢查設施及處理改善設施之綜合體。各設施有不可分離之速鎖關係，須互相調和，始能發揮其機能也。而單就改善生產物之品位言之，又可分為品質之改良，乾燥之改良，調製之改良三種，亦有聯帶之關係。我國目下對於各種設施，均未臻完善。若大規模之調製乾燥設備，更有待於提倡推行。而農民商販對於檢查政策，又無相當覜念，亦有賴於宣傳。在此過渡時期，卽欲嚴訂取締條例，强制執行，事實上必多障碍，自不待言。例如有大批小麥在運輸中途，被檢查為不合格，此時既不准其買賣，而又無調製乾燥設備，使之重行改善產品，其將何以處之乎。若欲照例執行，未免太苛，變通辦理，又違原意，放取締一時實不易施行，自當另求途徑。卽在施行取締之先，可採用放任主義，在小麥集散市塲，舉行簡單分級檢騐。此項檢騐之要旨，為只行分級而不加取締，可以免除取締方法所發生之困難，而分級小麥在市塲貿易可按級給價，仍寓有獎優貶劣之意。農民商販知經過分級檢騐之小麥，可得相當之代價，自能漸移默化，體會檢查之需要，於是再訂嚴格取締條例，而推行之，則各種困難，自可迎刃而解矣。此取締小麥攙水攙雜，所以應從簡單分級做起也。</p>

<h3>西湖之夏</h3>
<p>— （姚明然）</p>
<p>西湖山水的美麗，沒人不知道的。而夏天的西湖，更是值得歌頌的佳地！從蘇東坡居士六月西湖詩中：「畢竟西湖六月中，風光不與四時同；接天蓮葉無窮碧，映日荷花別樣紅」！已夠你憧憬了！記得曾子固西湖納涼詩：「問吾何處避炎蒸？十頃西湖照眼明，魚戲一篙新浪滿，鳥啼千樹綠成陰，虹腰隱隱松橋出，鷁首峨峨畫舫行，最喜晚涼風月好，紫荷香裏飛泉聲」，昔人幽賞錄也說：「蘇堤看新綠，三生石談月，飛來閣避暑，壓提橋夜宿，湖心亭採蒪」都是夏西湖的光榮史，可見夏西湖不重山水，而重荷花畫舫的湖景了呢</p>
<h3>非常時期——夏</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>夏是年中的一個最危險的季節，因為在夏季中，一切可怖的病菌的活躍，往往為一年四季之冠。近人甚麼都愛說一個「非常時期」，在衛生的立場上說來「夏」也該算是一年中的一個非常時期。</p>
<p>非常時期中，大家都小心翼翼於防空，在我們的夏的生活右，我覺得「防空問題」也是十分重要的。我們的空敵，是蒼蠅。每蒼蠅，都條一架散放毒瓦斯的飛機那麼的散放着霍亂菌，傷寒菌，痢疾菌等等，而致人於死。最有效的方法，對於敵機，是來一架，打一架，來二架，打一雙。對於蒼蠅，自然也是來一個，撲殺一個，來一雙，撲殺一雙。消極的辦法，那自然是仿效防空綱的方法，在食物上，蓋以紗罩，使蒼蠅不能與食物接觸。但是根本的辦法，那麼我想，該以「國防為第一」為訓，使室內清潔，蒼蠅遠避。在非常時期中，防空之外，尚有飲料問題，也是十分重要的，因為在緊張的空氣中，水道內，是常有給敵人放置毒藥的危險的。在我們這個年中的非常時期中，就是喝一口白水，總也得喝沸過的，才可不受敵菌的危險。內地河道中的水，不煮沸，果然喝不得，就是都市中的自來水，瞧着是十分清潔，但是自來水經過長長的水管，能否毫無細菌，尙屬疑問。就說自來水是百分之百的清潔，但是一經放出，便難保飲器上而附着的細菌，不隨之而侵入人體。所以雖是自來水，究也是喝煮沸的，才能千穩萬妥，不中毒計蚊虫，任誰都知道是傳種　疾菌的媒介，雖然不像散　的　　那麼的蒼蠅，來得可怕，但其鬼鬼祟祟的神情，倒頗有些像前些時，在四川鬧得滿城風雨的打毒針。也是非常時期中的一個大敵，亟須設法撲滅的。此外如臭虫，蟑螂之類，倒有些像在後方搗亂的奸細，若不嚴加搜捕，也有影響到整個大局的可能的。</p>
<h3>夏之晨</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>同文們執筆作夏的描寫時，總是愛寫夏之夜。不錯，在夏的夜晚中，果然是孕含着不少神秘的后后氣氛，值得無家可歸的流浪者迷戀，值得樂觀的，或是悲觀的詩人們，文藝家們，畫家們，以及其他富有情感的人們的頌贊，或是歎息，詛咒，或是，諷刺。但是我覺得，在夏的清晨中，却是別有一番滋味。</p>
<p>雖然一切酒排間，跳舞廳，都是在隔晚二點鐘，旋息了迷人的年紅燈，但是在太陽剛從地平線上爬起一個射着光芒的頂兒來時，一九三六年式的流線型汽車，從郊外入市時，都是載着一對對兒的男女，青年的紳士，與摩登的姑娘。青年紳士們，頭上的髪兒，已脫離太量司太康的控制，髪亂得覆在額上了。摩登的姑娘，也已褪掉了頰上的胭脂，唇上的口紅。眼上那黀的失神，顯示着整晚的疲勞，憧憬着海演，郊外，或是公園中的夜生活的歡樂，他們已忘却了一切夏的苦悶了。</p>
<p>人行道上，在狹長而汚穢的人行道上，人是像枕木那黀的躺着，排列着，他們都是在物質文明的都市中求生活，但是沒有享受現代的物質文明之福的人們。他們詛咒着都市生活的殘酷，但又沒有勇氣，逃出這都市。他們給屋子裏的蚊虫，臭虫壓迫得不能得到恢復一天疲勞的安息，同時，還給屋子裏的靜止的空氣，蒸　得呼吸都感到困難，於是只得這麼的席地幕天，追求甜蜜的夢中生活。但是無情的糞車，轉着沉重的鐵輪，驚醒了若干人的好夢，任誰臉上所顯示着的一點夢中的微笑，都給趕走了。不錯，這又是一天辛苦的工作，該開始的時候了。</p>
<p>但是，在這二個場面之外，在同一都市的別一區域裏，却蹲踞着一大方一大方立體式的大洋房，四周圍護着花草與樹木。金黃色的太陽，吻着青青的樹頂，顯示出夏之清晨的雍容華貴。在靜穆的空氣中，在鐵絲綱圍着的草坪上，偶然地傳出一聲二聲的綱球聲來。在鐵絲綱的疎眼中，顯示出高貴的西人在抽擊綱球的一個場面。同時，別一方草坪上，幾個中國阿媽，帶着一　西童，在跳躍遊戲。雖然他們也是住在這個都市中，但是，他們的生活，似乎是在別一個世界裏。</p>
<h3>看瓜田</h3>
<p>— 金粟蘭</p>
<p>時序的輪子不停的轉動着，是夏天了，天氣炎熱異常，供人作消暑妙品的西瓜先後成熟了。</p>
<p>陳全福種了四畝田的西瓜，青葱葱的一片，在那繁茂的綠葉下而，靜靜地躺着一個個大小不等的西瓜。</p>
<p>當這西瓜將熟未熟的時候，須得悉心防範着。陳全福用幾張蘆蓆在田邊蓋了一個低矮的棚子，裏面舖了條破爛不整的草蓆，他整日價躲在裏面看守着。</p>
<p>他隨身帶着一根旱烟筒和一把鋒利的魚叉，寂寞得無聊的時候，吸幾筒旱烟，足以破岺寂，又能興奮精神。</p>
<p>他好像是一個很有道行的靜修的高僧，跌坐在小棚子裏，閉　上眼皮養神，他似乎是睡着了，可是聽覺竟十分靈敏的還在行使着職責，偶而有一二聲犬吠或是過路人的腳步聲發自大道上，他就觸電似的驚醒了，探頭到棚外向四周察看，沒有什黀動靜，他的西瓜安然無恙，道才又縮到棚子裏面去。</p>
<p>夜間，他深恐有歹人來偷瓜，整夜不敢入眠，他振起了精神，又目炯炯的望着田裏耳朶用心的聽着，當疲倦得連連打呵欠時，他就燃了管旱烟拚命的吸着，藉以提神，他吸得十分的有力，白銅的烟斗裏竟吱吱的發出呻吟來。</p>
<p>田野裏靜悄悄的，一切都像是睡熟了一個個土丘似的小棚子星羅棋佈，看守的人都在戒備着，小偷雖然膽大，那裏敢來施展伎倆。</p>
<p>田裏突然的發出刷刷的聲音，那是刺蝟在　瓜。陳全福憎恨這種可惡的東西，馬上提了魚叉衝出去，可是那機警的刺蝟已逃得老遠了。</p>
<p>陳全福躲在棚子悶熱異常，但是他希望着天氣熱到百度以外，西瓜的價格日益昂貴，那麼他就就可以賺到許多錢，足夠他一家半年的吃用。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　視聽都非浮沉疑復柬　死生可託慷慨奇哀吟</p>
<p>國器聽明白了，照話去翻出來看時，第十五課是有了，但不是愛國之童子，題目是岳飛。手按了書，向學生們望着道：你們說是愛國之童子，這是岳飛呀。一個大些的學生，把書頁翻了出來，站起舉着給他看，笑道：先生，你看，我們這書上，不都是愛國的童子嗎？你翻的那本書是歷史，不是國文。國器被他這句話提醒，翻轉書封面來一看，可不是一本歷史嗎？這倒不由得撲嗤一聲笑了出來。自已極力的鎮定着,把神志澄清了，然後才把兩個鐘頭的功課講完。本來在這個時候，可以回家去吃午飯了，但是一看手表，還差着一小時，才是夢蘭下學的鐘點，於是慢慢的走到天井裏，抬頭向天上看看天色，又在校園裏轉了兩個圈。再看手表，也不過剛才消磨了十分鐘。心裏一轉念，就是這樣的消磨，很不容易的把時間銷磨過去的，於是走到閱報室裏去，把上海的幾份大報，從頭至尾，全看了兩遍。恰好在報上，發現了一篇很奇怪的西康遊記，於是按下性子去，把這篇遊記看完了。等到全文看完以後，這才想起有大事在身，放下了報紙，一面看着手表，一面向校外走去。這總算好，還是那個時候，已經走到深巷子裏來，照準時候，約莫過了五六分鐘。照說，這不能算是晚的。可是空巷寂寂那裏有個人影。心裏也就揣想著，他沒來？他過去了？站在巷子中間，只管左右兩邊，瞪了眼望着。於是抬起頭來，向人　的　　頭裏面去看　？因為人家　　面，正伸出了一　竹梢。（四九）</p>
<h3>玫瑰種種</h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>丘岡上，植遍了多刺的玫瑰，開着嬌艷的花朶，馥郁的甜香，是隨着薰風吹入人們的鼻孔中，多麼欣喜，花中「色香味」都有的，要算為玫瑰了。</p>
<p>玫瑰花：把玫瑰在樹枝採下，用炭火烘乾，收藏在在石灰缸中。泡茶敬客的時候，茶上放放兩朶，直能使齒頰留芬，玫瑰，「色，香，味，」是都有的。人人這樣講</p>
<p>蘇州各糖菒肆內，在玫瑰的季節裏，做有很好的玫瑰醬出售。但是我在蘇州　供職的時候，問玫瑰醬佐吃什麼食品最好？據一位蘇州人告訴我，說是蘸白粽吃最好，紅白相映，好看又好吃。</p>
<p>玫瑰花浸酒，也是十分佳玫瑰露，把玫瑰採取後，放入蒸溜鍋內，加增熱度，變成花露，暑天解渴，是非常妙品。</p>
<p>玫瑰的用處很多，如果在焙燥以後，也可擠成粉碎，攙入各種各式的點心內。很能受人的歡迎。</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>市立游泳池</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>夏天，照例又是一個「人魚」活躍的季節，所以這幾天我們在每一個游泳池裏，都可以欣賞到那些「人魚」們躍波掀浪的玩藝兒，尤其是這些「美人魚」們，伊們那種美麗的曲　，和活潑的姿態，會給予我們嘗試的誘惑與勇氣。</p>
<p>上海的游泳池，本來並不缺少；近些的有虹口游泳池，及體育花園游泳池。遠些的，有高橋海濱游泳場，而半公開的也有青年會及兩江東南東亞等幾個。但自從市中心區的市立游泳池開放之後，使一股愛好游泳的哥子娘兒們，又多了一個健身消夏的樂園了。</p>
<p>我雖不善游泳，但却也歡喜，所以常常總愛在幾個游泳池裏蹓　的；不過市立游泳落成以後，我只是在開全運會的時候，為了訪問楊秀瓊而去過一次，從此不曾有機會再去。現在那裏既然開放了，自然我也總得設法去觀光一下的。</p>
<p>在一個太陽毒得像火燒的日子，我為了想逃避這九十七八度的悶熱，所以便出一輛流　型的摩托車把我和筠馱着，爬上了那條平滑的其美路，直向市中心區飛一般的駛去——不到二十分鐘的工夫，我們便在一個很大的曠場上走出了車廂，抬頭，正看見那個巍峨堂皇的游泳池，敞着兩扇鐵門，像一個莊嚴的紳士似的，頗有禮貌地站在那兒笑迎着。</p>
<p>照例，寫是到女更衣室裏去更衣了，我也走進了有邊的男更衣室，而等到兩個人從兩傍玻璃門裏走出來時，游泳池裏及游泳池邊上，却已有不少男女「人魚」先我們而在了。</p>
<p>那個五十公尺，作長方形的游泳池裏，平平地放着一地水，那水是碧綠得像進一片翡翠，女人在水面上游泳時，好像一條美麗的金魚，更襯着那绿波的微漾，自然覺得格外的動人可愛了。何況還有許多隱約地　起在游泳衣裏的雙峯，和顫動的肉腿，能使人們陶醉呢筠先從跳板上鑽入了水裏，把頭伸在水面上，用手向我招了兩下，我站在邊上對四週望了一轉，於是用手在胸膛上拍了拍，也就跳到了池裏去。浸在水裏面，身心都感到了無限涼適，精神也暢快了許多，我和筠從淺水處撥足划水，盡力游泳着，向着水深處游去；我們兩個人便作了一閃臨時比賽，結果，還是筠的技巧比我精得多，所以我終於落後了一尺多遠。</p>
<p>在這裏，絕對沒有什麼男女的界限，大家都是一副半裸的色相，也沒有階級，儘可盡情地泳着，戲着。有的在水裏挽臂同游，有的却在池畔並肓細語，忘記了現實，忘記了醜惡，只是這一剎那是他們在樂鄉天國裏。</p>
<p>有幾個並不會游泳的女人，伊們雖也穿着一身時式的游泳衣，但只在淺水的地方踏着水花玩，或出男伴們在教導，哈哈嘻嘻，極盡了浪漫笑譃之能事。在這一剎那中，彼此都不會想到世界的不景氣，和大戰前夜的恐怖，大家都是要儘量地來享受盡這片刻的麻　和刺激！</p>
<p>水花聲，笑語聲，呼嘯聲，曼歌聲，只是在池的週遭打成了一片；泳着，瞧着，聽着，私語着，也絕不會感覺到肢體的倦乏了。呵！那不盡的狂歡！</p>
<p>已經是薄暮的時候了，於是我們更換上了來時的衣服，跟着大家　出了游泳池的大門。</p>

<h3>淋病服色素劑之注意</h3>
<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>自內服淋病製劑，因採行局部之「透膜殺菌」而宣告失敗後，于是色素之應用，又廣為提供於治療界中，以消炎殺菌等目的，而被病家所稱用，其治　界中，以消炎殺菌等目的，而被病家所稱用，其治療價值，實已超過舊有淋藥，然其功效雖大，副作用亦強，蓋猛烈之藥，未有不兼具精暴之惡影響者，且一向色素只被用於注射上，無採為內服之事，良以服用一有不當，輕則損害胃腸，重即引致生命危險，余前時用色素注射多數之病人，十九皆起嘔吐，顔面蒼白等副作用，自後閱歐洲醫藥雜誌，知近頃色素已出愛爾利西氏用科學之方法提凈，布羅令固博士更施于家免天竺鼠試騐之，證明確實無不良刺激，遂由彼得博士更用電化而製成「克淋儂」一藥。</p>
<p>考色素各國都有，以其流弊甚多，收功每不能含于理想。惟毫無敗胃及任何刺激而又係最初用于內服製劑之「克淋儂」世界所一致推許，甚有『「克淋儂」以外，無淋病效藥，而無「克淋儂」，即無色素製劑』之呼聲，喧　全世界淋病者之口。故仿製者踵接，此則病家當于購服時，認清真正「克淋儂」三字，切勿妄信人言而購廉價雜牌劣藥，以免誤服而釀致生命之　也。「克淋儂」之主治，為男女一切急慢性白濁，關節炎及尿道傳染疾患等，男子之　護，膀胱，　　炎等症，女子之陰門·　道·子宮頸與附屬器淋症，服之得于一定時日內，根本治愈，終身無復發之患。</p>
<h3>兩性之嚴重問題</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>應如何解決？</p>
<p>兩性之嚴重問題，厥為生殖發育不能健全，考生殖發育不全之原因，約有兩端，一屬先天，一屬後天，其屬先天者，即申狀腺生殖腺機能欠缺，以致發育不健全，矮小有類十三四歲之孩兒，屬於後天者，則為兩性之發育時代，濫施手淫，早婚房事過度，故生殖腺頓受摧殘，性器官往往停止發育，么小不類常人，又有遺精漏精等症，女子則臀部及乳房，皆不能如常發育，平坦如男子，毫無女性美之典型，月經遲來，或經水之量不足，往往停閉。其兩性一般之症狀，則有頭昏腦脹，視力減弱，腰酸膝冷，心臟跳突，判斷力皆失常，故做事乖誤，益增精神上之苦悶，而其最嚴重之問題，即不能享生育上之幸福也。此病惟一之挽救，厥為內分泌療法。</p>
<p>梅倫氏，乃近頃內分泌學大師也。孜孜矻矻研究不怠，卒發明其男用「補　康」，女用「補女容」二藥，其原料係採取勇壯動物之荷爾蒙，以科學之新方法所製成，服之能於最短期間，發揮其改造生殖系組織之偉效，並促進一切內分泌機能，不論先天或後天之發育不全，及其他一般症狀，均能藥到病除，其成績之優異，遠駕一切荷爾蒙之製劑而上之。故世界各國，心對於性的發育不全，及神經衰弱，莫不樂為采用也。</p>
<h3>急慢性胃加答兒之鑑別</h3>
<p>— 鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>吾人飲食偶有不慎，或國失於細嚼，或出誤食腐敗，而值茲夏令，攝取生冷及不潔之物，皆為引起胃加答兒這原因，此時之加答兒症，屬于急性，其症狀進行極為劇烈，見食甚厭，訴惡心及嘔吐噯酸等徵候。口渴，舌被白苦，口臭，吐苦水，若遇劇激之場合，兼有吐瀉腹痛等，本病之調治，須使身體安靜，飲以開水而使人工探吐，同時並服以消導劑，勿令腐敗　酵之食物停滯國防軍胃腸內，據多數專家之實駖，本病可用「強胃精」一　，因此酵酶之復方製劑，並具消導與防腐功能。且無刺激腸胃之嫌，故為本病之對症特效藥。</p>
<p>慢性胃病係由急性轉變而成，或因吸烟飲酒用腦過度而來，其症狀如胃部壓重，食後惡心，噯氣泛酸，口苦，　雜胸悶，腹部微痛，食慾減退，終至因消化不良而致身體困瘦，顔面蒼白，甚至起惡性貧血而陷于危篤。對於此種慢性胃病，惟有進服「強胃精」一法，蓋本劉最能糾正胃組織細胞機能，昂盛強大之食慾，使前述各症，一鼓殲除，又善作用于腸，凡瓦斯多而放屁，大便秘結，下痢，小兒吐乳緣便等，服之無不奇騐，因其含珍貴之榮養鹽及維他命B·能　缺乏維他命B之腳氣症，並有壯補全身之力，性純而毫無流弊，</p>
<h3>帶病自療法</h3>
<p>白帶為婦女恒見之症，故恒以其常見而忽之，加以婦女怕羞為其天性，所以多不肯舉以告人，致忍痛度日，亦良非得已也。患者除局部終日有涓流不已之黃白液體下注外，陰道亦每因此而浸潤糜爛，妨害排尿，刺痛瘙癢，且最易招惹細菌，變生巨禍，因而患白帶病者，往往引起月經失調，小腹作痛，他如臉色蒼黃，眼之四週呈灰暗色如帶眼圈。健全之美，亦於焉失去矣。</p>
<p>「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，久為西方各國婦女界所歡迎，，因其有抑　分泌，抗菌除毒，鎮痛消炎之效。毫無其他不良之副作用，故每個患有白帶之婦女，悉可在家　密自療。每晚取一片插入陰道，次晨洗去即得。惟如因丈夫傳染淋毒而棄　，可兼服「克淋儂」，以除內部之淋毒，　體　月經不調等而來者，可兼服「補女容」，以強壯身力，而調整其月經，依此自療，不難在數星期中治愈也。</p>
<h3>驅淋劑之新成功</h3>
<p>二十世紀乃科學之世界也。凡百困難問題，無不賴科學為之解決，對於醫學上之各科治療，亦無不日新月異，獨於淋病，則仍無法制止而降伏之，亦異數也。蓋淋菌為一善竄逃奔之微生物，初在生殖器之局部，如療治失當，即分頭奔竄，以致變症百出，熱如燎原，若仍事局部消炎殺菌，則藥性歇而淋菌仍捲土重來，且殺菌藥過峻，每能誅伐無辜，傷害健全組織，若太緩則淋菌仍消遙自在，依舊肆行無忌，往往病根反因此深進也。</p>
<p>故近頃新出淋藥雖多，求其有效者，千不獲一，惟彼得氏所發明之「克淋儂」一藥，堪稱驅淋劑中之新成功。除特製之色素劑外，更侶以各種提凈之殺菌劑，服後能直接在病灶上發生殺菌作用，毫不損害健全部分，且此藥服後，更能增強內之抗淋免疫素，凡散各處之淋菌，均能圍剿而殲滅之，遠勝於一班僅能透膜殺菌之局部療法也。對於急性慢性淋，如　護腺炎，前後尿道炎，　　炎，膀胱炎，及女子之子宮淋，陰道淋，陰門淋，與淋毒性白帶等，服「克淋儂」無不於短期內治愈。惟近來市上發見粗製濫造之黃色素製劑，其表面上所說之功效，又與「克淋儂」相似，顯含有影射，「克淋儂」之疑，因此往往貽害病家，故購時務須留意。</p>
<h3>鄧源和醫師肺病瑣談</h3>
<p>診所寗波路四川路口　診時下午四時至六時</p>
<p>除癆之增進營養問題</p>
<p>肺病為一種消耗性之疾患，故患者身體呈顯著之衰弱，體重銳減，精神不振，食思不佳等，因此，療法方面，遂多注重營養之改善，此法並非無相當效用，但只能視為療法之一，不能認為直接有治愈肺癆之功也。乃一般病家，味于此理，竟以身體之肥胖，為肺病痊愈之微，於是盡力　取脂肪，致成痴肥而來心臟病，或因　量過大發生　　變　，　　　險惡之症，　以　于肺病營養之增進，只宜在一定範圍內，謀體力之旺盛，而不必欲具豝壯。然而增進營養，並不能滅癆　肺，只須以　治及療養為根本治療。如果患者精神安靜，恪守有效製劑服之不斷，自然得于短期內，奏全部冶愈之效。</p>
<p>所　有效製劑，尙係近年來所發明者，其功效能減除病灶組織酸素之供給，而結核菌之繁殖，遂得防碍，於是治愈不難。此藥即近世　行之「補脯拿爾」是也。因其有增加肺結締組織之功，故又能包圍癆菌而撲滅之，對於喀血血痰，胸痛潮熱，食減咯痰，潮熱盜汗，顴紅肢楚，神倦身瘦等各期肺癆，服之雅有特效。且含豐富之補力，直等魚肝油，但天熱則無膩滯之弊。又具有Kresol之膠油體，善治傷風·百日咳·慢性氣管炎·哮喘等。</p>
<p>如肺病人兼有神經衰弱，最好同時以此藥與男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」並服，因二者能治失眼眠衰弱心悸健忘等，而前者又治遺情腎虧，後者又治月經不調，數者合服，為效必著，余迭以此法治愈多人也。</p>
<h3>夢精與精液漏</h3>
<p>因艷夢而來之遺精，謂之夢精症，多侵犯少壯男子，由于色情的意念或極輕度之刺激，如衣服摩擦，排尿，大便等，精液忽然漏出，謂之精液漏。</p>
<p>此二病應以早治為宜，蓋患者日久則呈　經衰弱，精神沉　，疲備倦怠，頭重，心悸亢進，背部疼痛諸現狀，每起頓死之危險。耐氏「育精片」因有鎮靜神經及收縮射精中樞之效，故對于前述各症，獨具殊功，一經服用，即得全部根瘳。四馬路中西有售</p>
<h3>「克淋儂」治騐一束</h3>
<p>淋病復發</p>
<p>患者田福雄君，前患白濁，獲友介紹，克淋特效藥服「克淋儂」而愈，旋田君因經商外出，久未返家，故厥病早已根治，亦幾忘其自身之曾患此病也。某次返家省母，重敘天倫之樂，豈知其夫人昔由田君傳染之淋病未愈，故田君未幾仍染此病，深為悔恨，抵滬至戴德醫師處治療，認田君之病，為後尿道炎，仍囑服「克淋儂」外，一方施行手術，約四星期即告全瘳。其夫之淋毒性白帶，亦內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」以滌除白帶，幸亦於短期中治愈。偕居迄今未發。篤愛逾恒云。</p>
<p>關節腫赤</p>
<p>患者倪仁寧君，羅淋病有的，迭經治療，功效未見，加以性嗜酒好動，致病態變生不測，某次又應朋友之約，於大醉酩酊之後，又出席某次運動會，症狀驟變，關節疼痛，發炎紅腫，幾不能轉側，又經多次醫治，仍未見效，乃改投姚菊　醫師治療，斷為急性關節炎，將有化膿趨勢，除行抗淋血清注射外，復投「克淋儂」以消炎殺菌，鎮痛退腫，約三期左右，即大著星功效，復診時病情已去六七矣，仍囑服「克淋儂」十餘天，所患全失，至今仍飲酒勞動，未嘗復發云。</p>
<p>體虛白濁</p>
<p>患者潘大鈞君，素有贏疾，前年又涉足花業，故更染淋病，因體虛之故，病雖不十分嚴重，但亦十分難愈，因此潘君更覺焦慮，以致又發遺精之患。嗣承鄧源和醫師介紹，囑於進服「克淋儂」外，時時仍服「補體康」，經數星期之服用，淋病獲除，遺精之患亦去，且從此體健逾於往日，見者咸謂前後判若兩人云。</p>
<p>一曲清歌</p>
<p>患者林琴山君，少年倜儻，好狎邪遊，然猶兢兢自守，未敢墮落也。某夕復應友人之招，聆某妓一曲清歌之後，即悠然神往，因而未久即染淋病，尿道灼熱刺痛，包皮　頭紅腫發赤，痛苦不堪，此急性淋也。幸林君素知「克淋儂」之功效，購服數瓶，即見痛止腫消，前後約服三星期，即獲全愈，後經血清檢查，呈陰性之無毒反應。即根治之證據也。</p>

<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>根治急性淋之療法</p>
<p>西哲有言，「淋病而能急治，實為患者之幸福。」良由患者在淋病初起時，症狀雖頗險惡，但以言冶療，則較之頑固難愈之遠年淋病，容易多矣，因急性期之淋菌，僅在前部尿道，如妥為醫治，則三星期左右，自能達到根治之目的也。患者大概與不潔異性接觸後之第三四期，尿道中初則覺有如蟻走虫行之癢感，繼則灼熱。排尿即覺困難，旋又有膿液之物從尿道中流出。夜間恒有勃起性之遺精，又往往於其時色慾旺盛，如已成婚者，則又每有將此可畏之淋毒，傳染其妻子之危險。當時因膿液等之分泌物，　頭包皮受其刺戟而發赤紅腫，尿意頻催，然每次小便則又困難萬分，痛楚難忍，以致日夜呼號呌喊，不能安枕。</p>
<p>關於此項症狀之處置，宜從速為之醫治，以免失去良機，現代最新療法，除行局部洗滌外，宜行電氣及X線療法，同時進服克淋特效藥，以殺菌消炎，鎮痛退腫，不難於三星期左右治愈之。至如不幸在急性期間誤行房事，致妻子發生陰道淋及子宮淋等，白帶涓流不已，除內服仍用克淋特效藥外。一方外用陰道片以拔除白帶，而免局部浸潤糜爛，自亦迅速治愈。凡夫婦染淋病者，皆宜按此醫治。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>十四歲小學生憂國自殺</h3>
<p>— 方九</p>
<p>憂國自殺的過去有南京軍官續範亭的剖腹自殺及監察院委員杜義的投湖自殺。而現在却有浦城一個年僅十四歲的小學生周自信吞食硝酸水自殺聞，在這國事日非，敵人的鐵蹄行將踏碎我大好河山的當兒，這些為國自殺的嚴肅舉動，怎不要感人到痛哭流涕耶？</p>
<p>我們對於軍官續範亭和監察院委員杜義的憂國自殺，雖然表示了嚴肅的敬意外，然而總不以為以自殺了，雖然這同樣也是消極的辦法，然而却是刺激我們的未死的活人們的心兒的。</p>
<p>小學生感情是特別豐富的，因此一受感動，就立刻大哭起來，他們是無所隱蔽什麼的。為了國勢的日益減　，小學生要入山求仙訪道，此無他，熟練了法術，可以為國報效呀！然而這是教育的不良結果，不能使小學生的愛國觀念納入正軌。可是小學生的憂國自殺的舉動呢？這，嚴格說來，也是教育不良的結果。</p>
<p>我們看周自信平日對於國難，是倍切注意的，師友咸器重之。時常往圖書館內閱讀報紙，報紙上所揭載的，當然是使人所　慮的。周自信這位可敬可愛的小朋友的遺信中，有兩句話是使我人十二萬分感動的：「　　逼得我們這般利害，我們國內還要自家打自家」十四歲的小孩子所感是如此，我們年大的青年壯年老年所感的，又何嘗不是如此呢？</p>
<p>我說這小學生的憂國自殺，嚴格說來也是教育不良的結果，乃是因為平日老師只出現把悲慘的國事告訴給小學生們聽，而不再進一步地鼓勵他們，指示他們救國的一條正確的路線。</p>
<p>我們應該嚴肅的站立起來，為這位憂國自殺的小朋友行一個最敬禮！</p>
<h3>鄉景</h3>
<p>— 澎</p>
<p>這次回鄉去，是預備在家中住下一個長久的時間。的確，這迢迢的人生的艱難的旅途，我已經爬行得夠了；蝸牛似的挨過了歲月。從十五歲出外，一直到現在，沒有聞過一點故鄉的草麥和稱和稱的氣息，只是在飛揚着灰塵的大都市中混着。負着生活的重累。</p>
<p>那知，住在家中十天也不到，我又重回到上海來了。故鄉的一切，太使我感到痛苦了！至今留在我的腦膜內的印象還要使我憂　着。</p>
<p>記得兒時的故鄉，是那樣地充滿着生氣呵！村莊上每家屋頂的烟囪中，都會冒出濃郁的烏烟。房屋一棟連接着一棟，蜂窩似的密佈着，擠得連走路的小巷都沒有。清晨或者是黃錯，村子頭上擠滿了人；老年人露着一副慈祥的笑容，熱烈地談着上古的故事。青年人則歡躍地談着四飛野各鄉村中，誰家娘兒們與誰家小夥子偷情的艷事。年青的女子，常年地打扮得像出嫁娘一樣——穿紅帶綠，驕傲着自己美麗的青春，三五成羣圍坐在一起，議論着小米般的細玩意，稻場上整日地看得見孩子們在那上面捉迷藏，從小由似的稻堆的後面流出他們天真的心情來。老婦人的呼豬和　喝雞鴨的聲音更鬧成了一片。</p>
<p>故鄉和我離別僅只有五個並不長久的年頭。這人事的變遷是多麼迅速呵！它破落得像一個殘舊的廟宇，再也聽不見愉快的笑聲了，給生活的重累，壓榨出來的怨氣，烏雲似的，圍繞着村莊，更充滿着原野……</p>
<p>回家的那一天，年老的伯父領着我六歲的姪兒，滿興奮地跑到四五里以外的小路上來接我。</p>
<p>也許是他太興奮的原故吧！見着我這並沒有發財的姪兒，回來了一下子，使他更陷入了苦痛的深淵。坐在跳動着火頭的菜油燈下，各人都沉默着——伯父，伯母，哥哥，嫂子，姪兒，儘低垂着腦袋，說不出一句話來，這可怕的沉默，第一天就使我這遊子懷念故鄉的心受傷了。</p>
<p>第二天一大早，我就對我的伯父說：我要回到我自己的家中去住些時，伯父聽了我這話，更露出了悲傷的臉子，他顫抖着聲音告訴我：「唉，你以為還有家嗎？墻也倒了，連磚頭也被人家搬走了，唉……」他泣不成聲，老淚橫流在他衰頹的面孔上：「唉！你還記得你的嬸娘吧？這女人不是好東西，在你出外的第一年，就跟二個異鄉的男子跑走了，忍心丟下了你的弟弟……」他舉起他那軟弱無力的手，指着我的伯母，意思是呌伯母來接住他的話。</p>
<p>伯母站在一邊也流着淚，她用袖子揩着眼睛說：「哎！他早已死了，還說什麼呵！」</p>
<p>伯父的村莊離我的家，只有五六里路的光景，只隔住了一重山，翻過山坡，我的家就可以在望了。這時，正是熱得使人腔悶的深夏的天氣，照在田中的金黃色的麥苗已在微風中招展了。可是小路的兩邊的田中，是那樣地荒涼，只零亂地散霉爛的稻草。今天才使我相信，這世界真的已到了有田無人種的時際了。</p>
<p>到家的時候，太陽已經偏了西，村莊上好像寂寞得沒有一個生物。村子頭上站着一個瘦得像蘆柴棍子的中年漢子，在有氣無力地劈着枯敗了的樹木。我們互相用着驚異的眼光望着，我不認得他，他似乎也不知道我。我們經過了他的身邊後，他依舊幹着他的劈樹工作。我問我的大哥，這人是誰？他突然擺出一副奇怪的表情，反問我道：「怎麼，連這人你也不認識了嗎？他就是從小整天地領着你玩的才　老二呀！」</p>
<p>「呵！就是才　老二呀！」一個很鮮明的記憶，在我的腦膜內復活了。才　老二，往日是一個如何和藹樂天的漢子呀！而今，他……我不敢更進一步地在我腦膜內找尋舊日的回憶。</p>
<p>我低垂着腦袋，頑強地咬着牙齒，畢直地冲進了我有那已經破敗了的屋子。</p>
<p>在那裏僅僅住了一　上，我依舊回到我伯父家中去了。我的身上那件染滿了油跡的小褂子的領子，夜晚睡來被耗子咬去了一塊，我的大哥更被牠咬傷了手指。</p>
<p>至今那件被食去了領子的殘破了的褂子，我還將它好好地保存着在，那就是我這次回鄉去的唯一的記念品呵！</p>

<h3>夏天的花</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>夏天的花最為人所稱道的是「荷」，但我這篇東西中，不想說到牠，因為我另有一篇東西專門寫牠了。</p>
<p>入夏以來第一種花就是石榴。「五月　花照眼明」，他的如火的猩紅，已經象徵熱夏的蒸熱，牠的强烈的燃味，好像南國的少女在健康的身格中著燒着火似的熱情，牠是一種力，是一種灼人心肺的力，在夏天的明朗的太陽下，我不知道有多少神經衰弱的人不敢正視牠</p>
<p>接着石榴花就是肥大的梔子了。韓退之詩「芭蕉葉大梔子肥」，這是一種象徵着夏天的酣暢的花，牠帶着少婦的風情，雖則並不以嬌美來撩人，但牠的丰容，實在使人得到無窮的回味。梔子本是亞熱帶的花，所以五雜俎上說「此花在閩中極多，且賤，與素馨茉莉皆不擇地而生者，北至吳楚，始漸貴重耳一。五雜俎著者者是明人，但他的話現在還適用。百花中花瓣六出的不很多，梔子花是六出的一種，所以吳歌中有云「梔子花開六瓣頭」特別標明他的特點——六瓣來作情歌的「起興」。我們家裏有梔子花三四株，暑期中堂姊表姊們都來我家暫住。我常常受她們的託付，淸早起來取一些初放的梔子侵在水盤裏，供她們梳頭時挿帶。因為自己有，所以她們總是一天換兩三次新的。鄰家的少女，偶然乞得一些，就侵在水盤裏供兩三天的挿帶。晚上大家聚在院子裏納凉，有時候夜黑得很，我們對面看不到人，只有梔子花的淸香，在風中襲來，知道了她們在那裏。</p>
<p>「芭蕉葉大梔子肥」芭蕉雖則也開花，但那只限於閩廣，江南的芭蕉開花的很少，因此人說芭蕉花就是瓊花，不知歡否？不過芭蕉雖則不大開花，而美人蕉却是在夏天開的。美人蕉的好和芭蕉花不同，不但美人蕉是紅黃色，而芭蕉是白色，就是樣子也不一樣。陳留仙說「美人蕉樹葉皆似芭蕉而稍少開花，殷紅鮮麗，千葉如槌，經數月不凋射，摘置瓶中，以水漬之，亦可經一兩月也」。的確，假使人家園院有了一二本美人蕉，那末漫長的夏天就不會寂寞了。</p>
<p>素馨，茉莉，芝蘭，都是夏天的花，五代詞「素馨花裏海南天」，那末，素馨之為亞熱帶花也無疑的。茉莉和芝蘭在江南還不時可以看到，燕趙之間就很貴了。這三種花大都以香勝，色和形是沒有什麼出奇的。</p>
<p>夜來花是夏天的主要花卉之一，昔人有云「是花孕於日中，開於枕上，實媚夜之淫葩，殢人之妖卉」。所以更有人說夜來香一定要雜於枕褥女人的肉香粉氣，聞之方盡其妙，這話我實在沒有理由否認他。</p>
<p>白蘭花不見於古書，而目前滬上就非常的風行，他的香和夜來香差不多，假使我的感覺不錯的話，那末牠較之夜來香更為淫媚，或則就因為牠的淫媚而風行於都市中罷。</p>
<p>夏天將要盡時，潔白的晚香玉上市了，這是微帶秋意的花，牠的潔白，牠的淸逸，沒有一樣不和夜來香，白蘭花相反」，現在我已經渴望着牠了，何况和牠同來的將是淸遠的初秋！</p>
<h3>失去了的笑</h3>
<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>生活的鞭子，將我從學校中驅逐出來。我把這社會當作伊甸園，不正視現實，更不關懷同類被屠宰的不幸的遭遇。我放蕩着性格，驕矜着自已。甚致於在我上峯的面前，我亦任性着不管人們（的憎惡，或者是喜悅，我幹着我情願所要幹的事。</p>
<p>於是，一些年齡比我尊的世故的友人們在向我警吿？「××，您不應該這樣地天眞呵！」</p>
<p>是的我不應該這樣地天眞，有時我聽了友人這樣的警吿，我脆弱幼穉的心靈上，是受了一個不少的打擊。我發誓要將這句話深深地印在腦膜中，不再明知故犯了，可是不久我又恢復我的原狀</p>
<p>愉快的時候，我會忘記了一切。脆弱的心靈上彷彿籠罩了爽朗柔和的陽光。在一羣友人中，我學着孩子似的樂意的跳着笑着，心裏想着什麽就說什麽。一句話剛從嘴裏流出來，兩邊腮脖子笑開口的時候，，一片憂鬱的暗影又蒙上我的心頭了。因為我可遭到人們惡意的諷刺。在他們的卑視的冷笑聲中，使我聽見了要呌我靈魂受傷的一些話，我常常地用滿腔的熱情換來了人們氷冷的臉色</p>
<p>這樣，我徬徨，我游移了，我不知道怎樣地做人。我讀過很多社會科學的書籍。我將我一些難解的問題，請敎過許多的友人，然而他們都不能給我一個滿意的答覆，我四面碰壁，我沒有一個知心的友人。寂寞，傷感包圍住我的心</p>
<p>白日，我躱閉在一間又狹又矮的小房間中，我彷幹了一件不興榮的事情似的，整日地讓苦痛的回憶以及濃重的煤烟，濃電的潮濕來絞着我年靑人的生命。晚間，耐不過寂靜的時候，卽使窗外落着瀰天的大雨，我也得跑到冷落的街上去野馬似的奔着。只有在這人們巳陶醉在夢鄉中的時候，我才能呼吸一點新鮮的空氣呵！</p>
<p>一個季節的到來，又是一個季節底逝去，我年靑人的威覺遲鈍得已近如白痴了。一年四季，我發呆的臉上，死水似的掀不起一絲笑容。</p>
<p>最後，連一個僅能喫飯的地方，也尋不着了。一個好心腸的友人向我勸吿着：</p>
<p>「××您忘了您自己，您忘了命運給您的是怎樣的一條道路，您需要笑，您需要笑呵！」</p>
<p>他把我帶到一羣大人先生的面前，他告訴我：您結識了他們，您就不愁沒有出路了；但是您需要笑。然而，我已經笑不出來了。卽使笑開口，那笑是多麼寂寞，凄苦呵！</p>
<h3>車水（一）</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>八畝裏是打牛皮港上水的，堤又高，水又淺，五人軸的水車槽吊水可就眞不容易，這塊田原有一一家合口，順富歪嘴二畝，壽根叔四畝，慶生寡婦家二畝，少水的時候，總是由壽根叔「哇啦哇啦」扯着大嗓子喚車水的。他一家頂四畝稻，自然上緊，而且僱着田夥計，不用自己化力氣。</p>
<p>這天老淸早，慶生寡婦正把梳頭傢伙搬在塲上理頭，壽根叔抱着他在四十二歲生的獨養子走了來：「你打算打扮了上那兒去？」</p>
<p>「呵，壽根叔早，預備上街欠點零碎。」她捧着解散一半的髮髻，早上的太陽掩不住她臉上的陰黯：「四天是我家的……毛小爸的忌日呵！」</p>
<p>算一算，慶生那可憐的忠厚人已死了三年了。毛小在七歲上給爸揑哭竹棒，抱牌位的，他今年十歲，可是生的那樣瘦小，鼻子老像傷風般的不淸楚，臉上刮不下一兩肉，東村梅堂老先生斷定他是奄子癆。村上人沒一個歡喜他的，慶生寡婦老為他哭，在慶生的墓上有時哭半天。可是誰也不給她哀憐的同情。對於明天慶生的忌日，壽根叔就絲毫不在心上，他祗是警吿式的說：</p>
<p>「你知道八畝裏要車水了，今天，今天！」</p>
<p>「哦，哦，不過，……就呌我家毛小來吧，我還要到土地廟裏去燒紙……」壽根叔手裏的獨養子哭了，他很不耐煩似地聽她說那些關於不吉利的死人的話，他「哼哼」她哄騙着他的孩子，一邊掉轉身子走向順富歪嘴家的後門口，一邊「嘰嘰咕咕」地說：「車水總是派孩子來，別人老吃你的虧，你家二畝田派一個小癆病鬼就够嗎……」這些話，這些話……（未完）</p>

<p>西宮夜靜百花香。欲捲珠廉春恨長。貴妃獨坐沉香榻。高燒紅燭候君王。高力士。啟娘娘。今宵萬歲落昭陽。太眞聽說添愁悶。懶洋洋自去却宮妝。和衣睡倒鴛衾上。見一輪明月照宮牆。孤單冷枕凄凉睡。陣陣心酸淚兩行。勸為人莫把君皇伴。伴駕猶如伴虎郎。想正宮何等花容貌。何故將奴撇邊傍。倒不如。嫁一個風流子。朝歡暮樂度時光。紫薇花相對紫薇郎。</p>
<p>何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球</p>
<p>麟記（一二二〇）下午二時一刻至三時　　開篇「十字思想」</p>
<p>一番春意夜溶溶。二分明月照簾攏。三更獨坐神如醉。四季相思總是空。五鼓鷄鳴人未寢。六郎粉面有淚痕濃。七夕難期牛女會。八行箋寫不盡兩情衷。九轉　腸腸欲斷。十索丁郎意朦朧。十二樓頭空盼望。九州鐵鑄恨無窮。八字眉為此常鎖斷。七絃琴訴出怨重重。六尺奇男竟被情魔困。五陵裘馬付東風。四大皆空談非易。三生無緣怨蒼穹。兩地睽違常憶念。一點靈犀未許通。百年事已付東流水。千里音書杳冥蹤。萬斛愁腸在夢魂中。</p>
<p>周振玉義妖傳</p>
<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半</p>
<p>開篇「紅樓小宴」（咪咪集創刊號）　　黛玉不减舊丯姿。漸漸精神復舊時。金篦不加鬆鬢髮。羅衣寬褪瘦腰肢。那寶玉暗先窺覺。便婉轉音聲勸慰之。當此圖屏秋色好。藥燼烟裏鬥新詩。你看這，紗窗影天然圖。銀燭秋光絕妙詞。倘是你故故撫床常獨臥。怕不被嫦娥窺見笑人痴。迎春姊妹妍然笑。說道行樂人生須及時。命紫娟卽刻排小宴。衆姊妹排坐不歉辭。木樨香送金樽滿。落紙揮毫不費思。寶玉却受金樽罰。早已白面泛胭脂。憑欄杆試望天邊月。缺陷全無大好時。寒露濛濛灑花枝</p>

<h3>明星第二廠　舉行大演習</h3>
<p>歐陽予倩應雲衛導演　二廠的演員多數演出</p>
<p>七月十七日明星第二廠召集還沒有一起工作過的攝影塲工作人作了一次演習。這個演習的主要原則是要在二廠開頭的二部獻：應雲衛的生死同心」和歐陽予倩的「淸明時節」沒有開拍之前，使這一羣新站到一條綫上的工作人互相有第一步的了解和聯絡。這個演習是分開了二組，第一組是歐陽予倩導演的，女演員黎明暉·李麗蓮·王飛娟·章疊蘋·陸露明等。和男的們謝靜波·李淸·田琛等。第二組是應雲衛導演，演員方面，則是龔秋霞·英茵·胡蓉蓉等。和男的王若希·劉茫·姚萍等。技術人方面，第一組攝影是嚴秉衡，收音是何兆璜兆璋弟兄。第二組的攝影是吳印咸，收昔是陸音鏗。這一個演習和正式拍戲無異，不過，導演者只是依了演員們的個性臨時給幾句有趣的對白和講一點短短情節，却是儼然作眞地演出了，會唱歌的像黎明暉·龔秋霞·英茵等便也唱了幾個歌，李淸等那幾個魁梧男子的表演也有伸拳搏鬥的，演　是自從下午二點開始到八點鐘才完。</p>
<h3>最完備的歌曲選　中國呼聲集不日出版</h3>

<h3>Chen Jitang Arrives in Hong Kong; Guangzhou Remains Calm; Guangxi Troops Entering Guangdong Ordered to Return to Guangxi Province; Guangdong Generals Telegraph Yu to Go to Province to Take Charge; Rumor Says Li Zongren Remains at Hekou, Sanshui; Lin Yunkai and Liu Jiwen Return to Province Last Night to Resume Posts; Xiao Focheng Says His Plans Depend on Recovery from Illness</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Hanmou held a military meeting in Shaozhou on the 18th evening and decided to first dispatch the First Army, the First and Second Divisions, together with the divisions of Wu Jianxiong, Ouyang Xin, and Chen Zhang, etc., to enter the province along the Guangdong road at full speed, with orders to advance into Tian by the 23rd and take over provincial defense on the 24th. Yu will not come to the province until the 25th. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is heard that the Wang and Zhou divisions of the Guangxi army entering northern Guangdong have been ordered by Li Zongren to return to Guangxi. Miao Peinan transferred the guard army to Sanshui on the 19th to prevent the Guangxi army from taking the opportunity to move eastward. Passenger trains on the Guangzhou-Sanshui road were suspended on the 19th, exclusively for military transport. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang has decided to go abroad, but the date is undecided. Guangzhou has increased the number of police patrolling, and order remains as usual. Guangdong currency has soared due to Chen Jitang's departure. Hong Kong dollars have only increased by 6.5%. (19th Dispatch) Lin Yunkai and Liu Jiwen returned to the province on the Taishan ship on the evening of the 19th to resume their posts. Li Hanhun, Deng Longguang, and others will also go after Yu Hanmou arrives in the province. Zou Lu arrived in Berlin to wait for a ship to return to China. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao Focheng said on the 19th that he has no intention of going north because he is not accustomed to the climate of the north. His plans depend on recovery from his illness. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang received a reply telegram from Chiang Kai-shek on the 18th noon and immediately invited Li Zongren and various army commanders to a meeting, deciding to step down. He immediately withdrew over six million from the Finance Department, paid over two million in back pay to the headquarters, and allocated another six million to Li for the Guangxi army's military expenses. Then, together with Li Yangjing, Chen Weizhou, Ou Fangpu, and others, he took the Haihu warship to Huangpu and transferred to the British warship Moufu to Hong Kong, arriving at 7:00 AM on the 19th. He is temporarily staying at Chen Weizhou's residence in Happy Valley and refused to see reporters. Li Zongren also flew to Nanning by civil aviation plane on the afternoon of the 18th, and Li's military police also left the province overnight. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Haihu warship that Chen Jitang was on was delayed by wind and rain and did not arrive in Hong Kong until 7:20 AM on the 19th. The Hong Kong Police Department dispatched more than 30 detectives at 1:30 AM, driving police boats to the port for protection. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The representative office in Nanjing of Army Commander Yu Hanmou said that Yu is currently in Shaoguan planning the aftermath. There are no military actions on the front lines. Several iron bridges south of Shaoguan have been destroyed. The troops will not move to Guangzhou until they are repaired. Yu himself will postpone his trip to Guangzhou for a few days. The Guangdong Air Force has all arrived in Shaozhou. Huang Guangrui will meet with Yu in Hong Kong within a few days, and may come north for a visit. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Linshu, Lin Jizhong, Huang Jilu, Chen Jiayou arrived in Hong Kong by train early on the 19th. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Several foreign reporters, upon hearing that Chen Jitang had arrived at Happy Valley (phonetic), rushed there this afternoon to visit him. They saw a guard standing at the entrance to the village with a handgun, preventing idlers from entering. When reporters inquired, the guard admitted that Chen Jitang and his brother Weizhou had arrived in Hong Kong on a British warship early this morning and said that Chen had gone elsewhere, but his brother was still living in a house in the village, but refused to allow foreign reporters to enter. Today, according to various Chinese newspapers, it is certain that Chen Jitang has landed in Hong Kong and arrived in port on a British warship early this morning. Chen, along with his brother Weizhou and several officials, has settled in Happy Valley. Chen is not feeling well and it is said that he consulted a doctor this afternoon. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although the local authorities acknowledge that they know Chen Jitang's whereabouts, they refuse to release any information to await the clarification of the overall situation. This is tantamount to admitting that Chen has arrived here, or is on a warship in the port. But it is not yet certain where Chen is or where the Haihu warship he was on is docked. Observers this morning witnessed a destroyer sailing at high speed signaling the shore. Many believe that the ship had contacted the Haihu warship outside the port. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Huang Renhuan unit of the Fourth Army departed for the Dongjiang River on the 19th. The Guangdong Provincial Government meeting will be held as usual on the 20th. Lin Yunkai can make it. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang plans to stay in Hong Kong for two weeks. After the Guangdong situation stabilizes, he will go abroad with Lin Yizhong, Ou Fangpu, Lin Shiqing, Du Yiqian, He Luo, Zhang Guoyuan, and others. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Lin Yunkai, in the name of the chairman of the provincial government on the 19th, said that Chen Jitang loves peace and has been relieved of his duties. The chairman will handle political affairs as usual, and local security can be guaranteed. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Linshu visited Lin in Hong Kong and persuaded him to return to the province. After Li Yangjing left, Huang Yanzhen replaced him as the commander of the three armies. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangxi Army's office in Guangdong was closed on the 19th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Railway Bureau announced on the 19th that it would resume northbound trains from Yingde and Yuantan. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The shipment of Guangdong silver to Hong Kong has been suspended and handed over to the Central Government for safekeeping. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lu, after learning in Germany that Xiao Focheng, Lin Yunkai, and others opposed Chen and Li's movements and left Guangdong for Hong Kong one after another, sent a telegram to his Hong Kong friend Cheng Hongxuan to represent him in offering his regards. Cheng also said that Zou had recovered from his illness and would return to Berlin immediately, waiting for a ship to return to China to take up his duties in Beijing. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Jilu, Huang Linshu, Chen Jiayou, and others arrived in Hong Kong by train from the province at 11:30 AM on the 19th, looking flustered. Huang Linshu told reporters that they are unimportant people, and returning to Guangdong is not a problem for them. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Lin Yizhong arrived in Hong Kong on the 19th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government Plans to Send Officials South to Guangdong for Consolation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government is planning to deal with the situation in Guangdong and intends to send three to five senior officials south to Guangdong for consolation. It is rumored that Xiao Focheng telegraphed Beijing that he will come north with Zou Haibin next month to report to the Central Government on the situation in Guangdong and discuss ways to clean up the mess. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Land to Protect Japanese Residents in Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) When Chen Jitang stepped down, he appointed Miao Peinan as the commander of Guangdong Security. The Japanese warship Saga, which was docked there, dispatched marines ashore on the night of the 18th to cooperate with the consulate police to protect Japanese residents. The city is relatively calm so far. (19th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Opens the West River to Monitor Guangxi Army's Actions</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Since Chen Jitang's departure, Guangdong has been actively making military preparations to resist the invasion of the Guangxi army. The entire First Division of the Third Army, led by Huang Renhuan, suddenly arrived here from the Guangdong-Fujian border last night and then transferred to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, aiming to go to the West River area to monitor the actions of the main Guangxi army. Within a few days, several other divisions in eastern Guangdong will be transferred to strengthen their strength. Before Chen Jitang left the province on the Haihu warship yesterday, he telegraphed Yu Hanmou, saying that he had retired, but hoped that all officials would continue to work hard in the future. The telegram was very brief and the wording was very peaceful. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Today, troops entering the province and heading to the West River area are endless. The province is completely peaceful. Among the troops that recently arrived in the province is the elite force formerly under Chen Weizhou. There are different rumors about where the team will go. Some say it will retreat to southern Guangdong to facilitate entry into Guangxi, while others say it will also head to the West River area. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Five regiments of the Guard Army were all transferred to the West River on the 19th to maintain order and prevent the Guangxi army from moving east. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Hanguang Flies Back to Guangdong to Report to Chen Jitang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jitang's representative Chen Hanguang flew to Shaoguan on a Ford plane at 8:00 AM on the 19th to meet with Yu Hanmou, and then flew to Guangzhou. He went to Hong Kong that evening to report to Chen Jitang. Before leaving, Chen said that Chen Jitang had decided to obey the Central Government's order, hand over all military power, go abroad for a considerable period of time, and then return to China. All officers and soldiers of the Guangdong Army, Navy, and Air Force have expressed their full obedience to the Central Government. The Central Government has also appointed him as the commander of the Guard Army, and he will begin organizing it after returning to Guangdong. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Airplanes in Shaoguan Flew to Nanchang Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) A telegram from Shaoguan reports that more than 40 planes that have returned will fly to the province today. The whole city is flying flags. Leaders are rushing to the airfield to welcome them. As of the time of publication, seven planes and 36 people have arrived. The rest will come later. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kuling Forty Guangdong Air Force planes and 130 pilots and mechanics flew from Guangzhou to Shaoguan yesterday, and today flew to Nanchang to apply for inspection by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The pilots said that the Guangdong Air Force did not want to start a civil war, so they left Guangzhou. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong Air Force personnel who arrived here yesterday told a Reuters reporter this morning that the Guangdong planes that flew from Guangzhou to Shaoguan yesterday will not move further north. They will return to Guangzhou after receiving instructions from the Central Government, as the current situation in Guangzhou can be regarded as practically resolved. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Guo Hanting, the captain of the 8th squadron of the Guangdong Air Force, led seven planes and more than 30 pilots to Nanchang on the 19th, staying at the Lishi Society and other places. Party, government, and military leaders Fan Zhengbo, Wang Juefu, Cheng Shihui, and representatives from all walks of life went to the airfield to welcome them and presented flowers to the aviation personnel to show their welcome. It is reported that more planes will arrive here on the 20th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin and Others Send Telegrams to Guangdong Air Force for Commendation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, and Chen Tiaoyuan telegraphed to encourage the Guangdong Air Force personnel on the 19th. Their original telegram read: "Commander Huang Guangrui and all comrades of the Air Force are respectfully acknowledged. Having read the telegram of the 18th, we are informed that you have led the teams of aircraft to Shaoguan, awaiting the Central Government's dispatch to promote Bo Nan's enlightenment. Your understanding of reason and loyalty to the country are deeply appreciated. We sincerely commend your hard work. We hope that you will continue to train hard, cultivate your loyalty, and demonstrate your fearless spirit to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the nation. We send this telegram to express our condolences and wish you success. He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Tiaoyuan." (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Luo Issues Proclamation to Maintain Security in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) He Luo, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued a proclamation stating that he will continue to be responsible for maintaining the security of Guangzhou to await Yu Hanmou's arrival in the province. At the same time, the situation in Guangzhou has gradually returned to normal. The Southwest Political Council and the Southwest Executive Committee were ordered to be abolished by the Second Plenary Session and have now ceased operations. This morning, posters welcoming Chiang Kai-shek and Yu Hanmou to handle the situation in Guangdong were posted throughout the city. Many believe that Yu will not enter the province until he has made careful arrangements for all matters. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Chen Jitang left office, senior generals returned to defend the province on the 19th to maintain order. The East River is the responsibility of the Third and Fourth Armies, and the North River is the responsibility of the Twenty-Fifth Army. Zhang Da returned to Xin Street on the Guangdong Railway car on the morning of the 19th, and Miao Peinan returned to Huaxian by car. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

We are doing our best to maintain security. Please send personnel to the province to handle everything." He, Li, Lin, Zhang, and Fan telegraphed Yu on the 19th, saying that the army commanders had returned to their posts. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Chen Jitang obeyed orders and left Guangdong, the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi changed drastically. The situation in Guangzhou has gradually returned to normal, and people's hearts are at ease. Li Shuzong, the commander of the Gendarmerie, and He Luo, the director of the Public Security Bureau, jointly issued proclamations on the morning of the 19th to reassure the people and jointly telegraphed Director Yu, requesting him to come to the province to preside over everything. After receiving Chen Jitang's telegram at Yu in the evening of the 18th, Yu Hanmou immediately convened a meeting of his subordinates and decided to send personnel to the province on the 19th or 20th to meet with He Luo to discuss handover procedures. He also ordered his troops to advance at full speed on the evening of the 18th. Part of the vanguard has crossed Juntian, and will arrive in Guangzhou around the 21st. Local businessmen, believing that Chen has left Guangdong and that war can be avoided, set off firecrackers to celebrate peace. They are currently organizing a comfort team with people from all walks of life to go to Yingde to comfort the First Army. Slogans welcoming Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, welcoming Yu Hanmou to handle the situation in Guangdong, and refusing the Guangxi army to enter Guangdong appeared on the streets on the morning of the 19th. He Luo's telegram to Yu and Li He's proclamation are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegrams from Generals (1) To Commander-in-Chief Yu, Secret. Bo Gong has left Guangzhou. We are doing our best to maintain security. Please send personnel to the province to handle everything. Looking forward to your reply. He Luo, Zhang Da, Huang Renhuan, Miao Peinan, Li Shuzong, Lin Shiqing, Zhang Zhiying, Fan Dexing, Du Yiqian, respectfully.

We have telegraphed to Jie Gong, asking him to order Wo Gong to come and preside. We eagerly await your reply. Brother Lin Shiqing, Zhang Da.</p>
<p>Proclamations (1) Proclamation by the Gendarmerie Headquarters. Since the army was involved in the war, the situation has been uncertain. Commander-in-Chief Chen, with the heart of saving the country and worrying about the people, could not bear to see the people of Guangdong suffer, and resolutely left the province on the 18th. All issues have been resolved satisfactorily. This headquarters has been ordered to work with the Provincial Public Security Bureau to maintain security in the province and city, and is awaiting Commander-in-Chief Yu to come to the province to preside. It has been found that the suburbs of the city are extremely peaceful, and this headquarters has increased the number of troops patrolling day and night. If there are any evildoers who spread rumors to confuse the public and disrupt security, they will be punished according to the law once they are caught. (2) Proclamation by the Public Security Bureau. This proclamation is for the matter of the proclamation. Since the outbreak of the war in this province, due to the repeated obstacles of the environment, the situation has been uncertain. Commander-in-Chief Chen, with the intention of worrying about the country and saving the people, resolutely retreated on the 18th to quell the disputes. However, the security of the capital of the province is of utmost importance. I, being the Director of Public Security, have been in charge of security for four years. I have always been loyal in administering politics and issuing orders. Since I have been dealing with the people for a long time, I have shown sincerity to all. Now, at this difficult time, I should sharpen my spirit to ensure that the residents are stable and not frightened, and that the province turns from danger to safety. Once Director Yu Huanjing arrives as soon as possible, I hope to relieve him of his responsibilities. Considering that the province's capital is vast and the population is strictly investigated, there is always a risk of criminals hiding. If there are any disturbances that take advantage of this time of doubt and panic, heavy penalties will be imposed. The true sincerity is used to warn everyone to abide by it.

<h3>The New Trend of the Banking Industry in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Since the financial panic of last year, many commercial banks in our country have narrowed their scope. Recently, there has been a new trend in the way they lend money and organize themselves.</p>
<p>Commercial banks' lending to industry and commerce has long been difficult due to the decline of industry and commerce in recent years. In speculation, it is difficult to seek favorable development after currency management. Under these circumstances, in order to reduce the responsibility for lending, banks strive to diversify the amount of capital used. The target of lending has shifted from industry and commerce to rural areas and government construction projects. The recent organization of Jiangsu and Zhejiang spring cocoon syndicates, fishing industry syndicates, etc. is one example.</p>
<p>As for the organization of banks, it is gradually shifting from dispersion to concentration. Commercial banks have been increasing rapidly in the past few years, but the weakness of their strength and the dispersion of talents are unavoidable. The recent trend is that banks with similar characteristics, such as Zhonghui and Jiangsu-Zhejiang Bank, Jiangsu and Silk Industry Bank, are merging. Although it is impossible to know how the business will be conducted after the merger, it is commendable in terms of concentrating strength.</p>
<p>Lending targets are tending towards rural areas and national construction projects, which is of course correct from the perspective of the national economy. But what should be noted is that it is difficult to easily talk about investment in today's industrial and commercial decline. However, the decline of industry and commerce is due to the environment. Therefore, how to use strength to help industry and commerce struggle out of the darkness is still a part of the responsibility of financiers. Regarding lending to rural areas or agricultural products, we believe that lenders should also pay attention to the commercial environment. In the past, silk and tea loans often caused the abuse of excessive lending. As a result, agricultural product prices plummeted, putting farmers and themselves in an unfavorable position. As for assisting government construction projects, although the interest is still passed on to the general public, it is of course different from the heavy exploitation of public bonds in previous years.</p>
<p>After the merger of commercial banks, their strength will be increased, and their business development plans will be easier to implement. We have two small hopes for the subsequent business plans of these banks. (1) Each bank in the group should preferably identify its own target and do it separately. In this way, the division of labor will be meticulous, and observation can be thorough. (2) In the past, many commercial banks were mostly concentrated in a corner of Shanghai due to the limitation of funds when they were established, forming a unique expansion of urban finance. After the merger, if it is impossible to get rid of the city due to various relationships, it is hoped that more strength will be distributed to the inland to fulfill the responsibility of regulating finance.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the Guangdong army unanimously oppose the Guangxi army's eastward movement, because the Guangxi army will be issued military pay and equipment as soon as they arrive in Guangdong, while the Guangdong army has been in arrears for three months and has not received a single cent. There is also a unanimous expression to welcome Yu Hanmou. Many believe that Yu can arrive in Guangdong within three days. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang's Resignation and Departure from Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Armies of the Guangdong army opposed the war and Huang Guangrui and others led the entire air force team and pilots to leave the province, the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi suddenly disintegrated. At the same time, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the 18th, which showed great care and concern, which was quite moving. He then decided to implement his resignation and return political power to the Central Government. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, he convened a meeting at the headquarters and announced his intention to leave Guangdong. All the generals expressed their approval. At 12:00 PM, he summoned Li Yangjing, Miao Peinan, Lin Yizhong, Ou Fangpu, Lin Shiqing, Du Yiqian, He Luo, Li Shuzong and other confidants at the Yantang Military Academy to discuss how to handle the aftermath. (1) All troops in the northeast and two rivers and garrisoned in the provincial capital were handed over to Li Yangjing and Miao Peinan for unified leadership. (2) The security of the provincial capital was handed over to Li Shuzong, the commander of the Gendarmerie, and He Luo, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to be responsible for maintaining it. (3) In terms of politics, it was divided into Lin Yizhong, Ou Fangpu, and Huang Linshu to temporarily maintain the status quo. When Yu Hanmou arrived in the provincial capital, he would properly transfer them separately. He drafted a telegram to Yu Hanmou, expressing his imminent departure from Guangdong. The original text of the telegram has been seen in yesterday's telegram. After the meeting, Chen returned to the headquarters to finish unfinished military affairs, and summoned senior personnel to make a farewell speech for half an hour. The content is unknown. Li left, Chen returned to his private residence in Meihua Village to rest for a while, around 4:00 PM. Lin Yizhong and others rushed to meet with him again to talk about everything. At 4:45 PM, Li was refused by the Guangxi army in the Xicun area of Huangsha, and failed to seize Guangzhou City. All the plans failed. He then took the Southwest Civil Aviation plane back to Guangxi. The tense situation in the provincial capital gradually eased. Chen Jitang was able to take Chen Weizhou and more than a dozen guards by car from his residence to the Yuzhu Fortress at 5:05 PM, boarded the Haihu warship and drifted eastward. Goodbye Guangzhou. Only a few people, including Lin Yizhong, came to the dock to see him off, and they faced each other sadly. The ship sailed to Huangpu and stopped. Around 9:00 PM, Chen changed to a British ship to Hong Kong. It was originally planned to arrive at the port at 3:00 AM on the 19th. However, a strong wind and rain made the journey very slow, and it was delayed until 7:00 AM to enter the port. The Hong Kong Police Department sent more than 30 detectives, divided into police boats to escort them. More than 20 Chinese and foreign reporters also drove electric boats to wait on the sea. At 7:20 AM, the ship berthed on the Tsim Sha Tsui sea. Chen and others changed to a small boat opened by his family to meet him, leaned against the Taikoo Wharf, and boarded the shore in the wind and rain. They took a car straight back to the private residence on Fenghui Terrace to rest. Chen did not meet with reporters due to physical discomfort, and no written statement was released.

<h3>Financial Authorities Plan to Reorganize Guangdong's Currency System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial authorities are now planning to take advantage of the military and political reforms in Guangdong Province to thoroughly reorganize the currency system in Guangdong Province without harming the social economy and the people's livelihood, so as to avoid the people of Guangdong from falling into an irretrievable place. It is reported that the responsible personnel of the three major banks of the Central Government, China, and Communications came to Beijing a few days ago to take advantage of the convenience of a certain senior official in Guangdong Province to discuss ways to solve this problem. A complete result has been obtained. The reorganization of the Guangdong currency system this time can be carried out smoothly, but the future value of Guangdong Hao coupons will depend on the adequacy of its preparations. All parties hope that Chen Jitang will not reduce the reserve fund of Guangdong Hao coupons at this time of handover, so as to avoid falling Guangdong finance into an irretrievable place.

<h3>Lin Yunkai in Hong Kong Telegraphed Tang Shaoyi and Others to Express His Plans to Save the Crisis</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guangdong Chairman Lin Yunkai opposed the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi and has arrived in Hong Kong with Xiao Focheng. He telegraphed his fellow villagers Tang Shaoyi and others in Beijing on the 18th. The original telegram read: "To Secretary-General Ye Chucang of the Central Party Department of Nanjing, Mr. Tang Shaocuan, Mr. Wang Liangchou, Mr. Xu Ruwei, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Ma Chaojun, and all fellow villagers, Mr. Zhuo Guangsheng, translated and forwarded. The situation in Guangdong is becoming increasingly serious. Peaceful mediation is ineffective. I have no choice but to follow Old Fo to Hong Kong to show my firm opposition and promote the authorities' awakening. Once the military opportunity is launched, the future will be long. All of you are concerned about your homeland, and I hope you will work together to express your loyalty and save this crisis. I can only do my best to try to remedy it by any chance. Lin Yunkai."

<h3>Montreux Plenary Session Passes New Convention Draft; Two Protocols to Be Signed Tonight; Turkey to Restore Fortifications in the Straits Immediately; Two Japanese Training Ships Permitted to Enter and Exit the Black Sea Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Montreux The Montreux Conference held a plenary session this afternoon and immediately passed the draft of the new Straits Convention. It was decided that the initial signing would take place at 10:00 PM on Monday (July 20th). In addition, the conference also passed two protocols. The first allows Turkey to re-establish fortifications in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits from the 20th of this month. The various articles of the new convention will be provisionally implemented by Turkey from August 15th. The second allows two Japanese training ships to pass through the straits simultaneously. The original text is as follows: "Of the three Japanese naval training ships reaching the end of their service life, it has been agreed that two of them may pass through the straits into the Black Sea simultaneously, and their total tonnage, even if it exceeds 15,000 tons, will be treated as such." (Note: The tonnage of warships from any non-Black Sea littoral state allowed to pass through the straits is limited to 15,000 tons.) (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Montreux Yesterday afternoon, the Montreux Conference held an open meeting and passed the final draft of the Straits Convention, which includes a protocol stating that Turkey can provisionally implement the conditions of the convention from August 15th. Turkey has the right to immediately re-establish military defenses in the straits. The protocol takes effect from the date of signing the convention. The Turkish government is scheduled to host a banquet next Monday evening to entertain the delegations of the participating countries. A public meeting will be held at 10:00 PM that night to sign the convention. It is reported that Turkish representatives are preparing to send urgent telegrams to Ankara and Istanbul after the signing, whereupon troops from both locations will depart to enter the demilitarized zone. Before the final draft of the convention was passed yesterday afternoon, representatives gave speeches. The Greek representative, Poletis, stated that it was the first act of restoring international law, and that Turkey could now be seen as the standard-bearer for this action. The Turkish representative, Karalas, announced that the Turkish government was determined to maintain the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne regarding the preservation of cemeteries in the straits and war zones and to allow people to visit them. The British representative, Stanley, rose to express his gratitude for Turkey's commitment. The Australian representative, Bruce, said that Australia would warmly welcome this. The French representative, Peng Gu, also expressed France's gratitude. The Japanese representative, Sato, said that this was the first international agreement signed by Japan since its unfortunate departure from the League of Nations. The audience paid attention to this. According to the provisions of the convention, the Dardanelles Strait is prohibited to warships of belligerent countries during Turkey's neutrality, except for those fulfilling obligations under the League of Nations. Aircraft are also not allowed to fly over the fortified area. Italy did not have a representative present at this meeting, but is able to sign the agreement at any time. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Montreux The Montreux Conference convened today to discuss the draft of the new convention. The Bulgarian representative immediately stated that he would no longer reserve his position on the Japanese amendment (the content of which advocates that the measures Turkey may take in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant should be implemented only after the League of Nations Council, by a two-thirds majority, and a majority of the signatory countries of the new convention have approved them; this has been satisfied in principle by the Montreux Conference). The Romanian representative also said that his country originally argued that the measures Turkey could take in the event of a danger of war should only be decided by the League of Nations, but now he no longer opposes the Japanese amendment. Thereupon, Sato (Ambassador to France), the chief Japanese representative, thanked Romania, but said that Japan still always reserves a free attitude towards the League of Nations Covenant and the various regional conventions concluded within the scope of the Covenant. The Soviet representative then spoke, saying that Japan had the right to make this reservation, but the Soviet Union fundamentally disagreed with Japan's opinion. Sato then declared that although the Japanese delegation had accepted the draft of the new convention, it would not take effect until it had been approved by the Privy Council of his country, which was a necessary procedure according to the constitution of his country. Thereupon, the meeting immediately opened to the public and announced that a compromise had been reached on the draft of the new convention. Peng Gu (former Minister without Portfolio), the chief French representative, declared that it was an innovation for an international conference to achieve such results. The reason was that Turkey had requested amendments to the treaty through legal procedures. Other representatives also expressed their admiration for the attitude taken by Turkey. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement; Anglo-Turkish Agreement Expires; Turkey Still Bears Unilateral Obligations to Britain Under New Treaty</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital Following the conclusion of the Montreux Convention, well-informed sources here recently stated that the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement previously concluded between Britain and Turkey has now expired due to the cancellation of sanctions against Italy. However, Turkey should still fulfill the unilateral obligations it bears to Britain under this agreement. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Statement on the British Question; Germany to Reply Imminently</h3>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored here today that the German government will reply imminently to the British government's questions regarding Hitler's peace plan for Western Europe. It is reported that its reply will be more satisfactory to Britain than expected. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Seeking International Cooperation Based on the Concept of Equality; British Foreign Secretary Reaffirms Policy</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech in Bradford, reiterating that the British government is determined to work with all countries on an equal footing in order to ease international tensions. He said, "If we want to achieve the goal of easing international tensions, we cannot achieve anything by acting alone. Since the March 7th incident (namely, Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Treaty and the entry of troops into the Rhineland), every stage of British policy can be explained by this idea. What we seek is to seek new opportunities for cooperation among European countries in this incident, in order to find ways to solve the general situation in Europe. Our attitude towards previous international conferences is based on this determination, and we should continue to do our best to work hard together whenever we have the opportunity to make lasting progress in the European situation. However, if anyone, because of our country's love of peace, wants to tempt our country to abandon its vital interests as the price of peace, then it can be said that he misunderstands the British character very much. We have repeatedly stated that we have special interests in certain parts of Europe, and therefore we have the obligation to maintain certain guarantees in those parts. This attitude has never changed, but it is not correct to conclude from this that Britain is indifferent to other parts of Europe, because Europe is geographically very small, and we cannot separate areas that should be concerned from those that should not."

<h3>British House of Commons; Heavy Workload This Week; Debate on National Defense Procedures Today</h3>
<p>(London) The work of the House of Commons will be very heavy next week. On Monday, it will debate the government's national defense procedures.

<h3>Locarno Conference of Allied Nations to Open; Britain Drafts Declaration; France Will Not Allow Britain to Over-Compromise with Germany</h3>
<p>(London) The French Ambassador to London, Gorping, informed Foreign Secretary Eden today that France had agreed to Eden's proposal to hold the future conference of the three Locarno Treaty signatory countries, Britain, France, and Belgium, in London instead of Beijing. The conference will probably open next week on the 23rd and will last for a very short time, as it will be limited to registering the resolutions already obtained through diplomatic channels. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of a joint declaration issued by Britain, France, and Belgium before and after the opening of the Locarno Conference, it is reported by well-informed sources here that difficulties have arisen, because the British government is currently drafting two versions of the declaration, one declaring the agenda of the three-country conference, and the other declaring that the purpose of the future five-country conference is to revise the Locarno Treaty and formulate new methods for solving Europe based on the principle of equality among countries and taking into account the peace plan announced by German leader Hitler on March 31. However, the French government does not agree with the content of the second declaration, believing that the peace plan proposed by France on April 8 should also be taken into account, and that it should not only be able to accommodate the German plan. The French government also believes that if the resolutions that the three-country conference can reach are negotiated before the meeting, then the meeting will no longer have any meaning. It is reported that the first declaration can be drafted immediately, while the second declaration will begin to be drafted after the three-country conference. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Foreign Minister Expresses Continued Struggle for Peace</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin, Molotov, and Krynen sent telegrams to congratulate Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov on his sixtieth birthday. Litvinov replied, "Soviet diplomacy is now watching the dangerous objects that hinder peace. Although other countries have failed to provide full cooperation, the Soviet Union must strive to remove this obstacle to peace. At present, due to the dissipation and dimming of peace forces, the dark war clouds are becoming denser. The Soviet Union's struggle for peace will always be unremitting." (18th Tass Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Danzig Curbs Opposition Parties; Takes Strict Measures; National Socialist Government Completely Seizes Power; Whether There Will Be Further Developments Remains to Be Seen</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the Danzig government put forward strict plans to curb opposition parties, including (1) the government has the right to dissolve groups that spread rumors that seem to endanger the country, (2) the maximum period of detention is extended from three weeks to three months, (3) police orders of a political nature shall not be reviewed by the courts, and (4) politicians are prohibited from serving concurrently as journalists, and contains other provisions. It is said that this order aims to maintain public safety and order in Danzig. (18th Reuters Dispatch) Danzig The Senate today passed a number of radical measures and has completely handed over the power of the Free City to the National Socialist government. According to the new law, all political organizations can be dissolved at any time without notice. The "protective custody" of the people by the government, which originally could not exceed three weeks at most, has now been changed to three months. (18th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, a French official stated that suspending Danzig's political guarantees may seem to be an internal decision at first glance, but whether there will be further developments will be watched carefully. At that time, it will be necessary to consider its external repercussions. This is not an issue between France and Germany, but an international event related to the League of Nations. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw After the Danzig authorities took amazing measures today to revoke the various freedoms stipulated in the constitution, responsible persons here recently stated that these measures were purely intended to deal with internal affairs, and that the international impact they could have was within the purview of the League of Nations and was not something that Poland was willing to intervene in alone. What Poland is paying attention to is only to protect its own interests, and there are no other ambitions. Political figures also stated that the Polish government had anticipated the events that had recently occurred in the city. However, the Polish government has always remained neutral in the city's party disputes. Now that the city authorities have taken new measures, the Polish government will naturally study them, but should be based purely on Polish interests. Government officials believe that the dispute between Poland and Danzig has ended since the German National Socialist Party came to power. Now that the Socialist Party, the Catholic Central Party, and the National Right Party have formed a faction, it is not what the Polish government wants to hear if they regain power. On the opposition side, it is believed that the measures taken by Danzig will inevitably endanger Polish interests, but the government is taking a passive attitude, which is very reprehensible, and it is said that Colonel Beck, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has recently been staying on the Polish coast, which is not far from Danzig. He met with Ambassador to Germany Lipski and was introduced by Babey, the Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, to contact the city authorities. Then, Chairman Glazer of the city council, regarding the guarantees provided by Babey, that the actions taken by the city council to suppress the opposition parties would never go beyond the scope of the free city's system, Beck must have known it. Today, most of the people in the city harbor pro-Polish tendencies and are willing to belong to Poland's protection. This is a phenomenon that has not occurred for hundreds of years. The government should make every effort to protect Poland's rights in Danzig at this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and never give up lightly. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the Danzig authorities took amazing measures to revoke the various freedoms stipulated in the constitution, political figures here recently stated that politicians from Britain and France may informally discuss the Danzig issue during the Anglo-French-Belgian conference in London, because the Council of the League of Nations decided at its meeting earlier this month to entrust Britain, France, and Portugal to jointly investigate the Danzig issue with Poland. In addition, Britain and France may suggest convening a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations to deal with this matter, but no decision will be made until Lester, the League of Nations High Commissioner to Danzig, submits a report.

<h3>Travelogue of Japan</h3>
<p>— (5) Our Reporter Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(4) Kobe City Hall</p>
<p>The next morning, we went to the Consulate General again and met with Consul General Jiang Huaben. Consul General Jiang has a long history in the diplomatic field, having served as a chargé d'affaires and stationed in Kobe for several years. His smiling, mature, and round face made us feel close at first sight. We discussed the itinerary of the trip with him and planned to stay in Kobe for another day to visit the City Hall and several newspapers. Consul General Jiang prepared several letters of introduction for us. We took the letters, got into a "Taxi" outside the consulate, and went straight to the City Hall.</p>
<p>The Kobe City Hall is located in Tachibana Street, Minato East Ward, and is a magnificent building in the shape of a mouth. The facade is a three-story building, and the other three rows are two-story buildings, with a large courtyard in the middle planted with several banana trees. In front of the door is a raised, large square built of cement. Our car drove up from the road along a gentle slope to the door. Looking up, we could see two intersecting arcs made of cement on the high lintel, which, like a sign on Mount Suwa, is the coat of arms of Kobe. As soon as we entered the gate, we saw a messenger in a police uniform sitting at a small table inside the door on the right. We handed him our business cards and asked to see Mayor Katsuta Ginjiro. He led us upstairs and waited for a moment in the Mayor's reception room. Then Secretary Kai Gunki came out and talked to us on behalf of Mayor Guang. We asked about the recent development of Kobe, and he answered us one by one as follows:</p>
<p>I heard that Kobe's foreign trade has seen great development in recent years. I wonder how it compares to other commercial ports in your country?</p>
<p>Kobe Port's foreign trade used to be inferior to Yokohama in terms of exports and superior to Yokohama in terms of imports, but in recent years both exports and imports have exceeded Yokohama. Last year, the total amount of foreign trade in this port was about 13 million yuan, accounting for one-third of the total national trade. Among the three major trading ports in Japan, Kobe ranks first in terms of the total amount of import and export trade, Yokohama ranks second, and Osaka ranks third.</p>
<p>We have always admired the encouragement and protection that the administrative authorities of your major cities give to industry and commerce. Please tell me what methods your city has adopted in this regard.</p>
<p>Our city's Minato River Park has a Promotion Hall. If the industrial and commercial sectors want to hold a commodity sample display, exhibition, or Bo Jue meeting, they can borrow that place as a venue. The government will naturally do its best to provide guidance. In addition, we are constantly planning and implementing appropriate methods for rewarding and introducing local industry and commerce. The Industry and Commerce Section of our city hall has a specialist stationed in Manchuria to handle the introduction of our city's industry and commerce. In addition, the city hall is also investigating the status of industry and commerce in our city and publishes "Kobe City Commercial and Industrial Overview" and "Kobe City Commercial and Industrial Directory" every year for general industrial and commercial operators to refer to.</p>
<p>Your office must also be very concerned about the welfare of the working-class citizens. I wonder if there are any special facilities to give them practical benefits in life?</p>
<p>The social undertakings carried out by this city are similar to those in other cities in this country. There is nothing special to say. In addition to running many agencies related to public health, we also have many public canteens and common lodgings for the poor laborers, thinking about their food and lodging. The nature of the public canteen is to provide clean and nutritious food to workers at very low cost. There are five types of meal tickets, the lowest is a three-cent ticket, and the highest is an eleven-cent set meal ticket. The common lodging is well-equipped, and each night only costs seventeen cents for accommodation.</p>
<p>Next, we asked Secretary Kai; "How is your city's recent financial situation? What is the average tax burden per citizen?"</p>
<p>He thought for a while, then led us to the Finance Section. It was a very large room. Closely packed old writing desks were filled with Western-suited section members, burying their heads in the cluttered piles of paper. He talked to a section member for a while, turned around and said to us: "The Director of the Finance Section is not here. I can only know about the financial situation in the past year after asking him. However, if you want to know about the Showa 9th year, I can get some printed materials." Kobe City Hall</p>

<h3>Revolution Breaks Out in Morocco; Chaos Spreads in Spain; Meaning of Cabinet Reshuffle Unclear; Government Claims It Can Control the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>Madrid A rebellion broke out in Morocco on Friday, and Prime Minister Quiroga suddenly resigned amid national shock. However, Barrio was immediately appointed as his successor. Barrio came from a typesetting worker background, once served as Prime Minister, and was also the interim President temporarily after President Azana was removed from office in April of this year before President Achina was elected. The significance of Barrio's succession to the cabinet this time is not yet clear. (19th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid The Quiroga cabinet submitted its general resignation yesterday evening. At that time, the residents of the city of Melilla in Morocco were clashing with the rebels and were being supported by bombers sent by the government.

<h3>Government Fully Suppressing the Rebellion</h3>
<p>Madrid - The government issued a broadcast message at noon today, stating that government troops had engaged in street fighting with rebel forces in the port of Barcelona, capturing numerous high-ranking and low-ranking rebel officers and seizing five cannons. At 12:30 PM, another broadcast message announced that the disturbances in Barcelona, Seville, and Malaga had been quelled. The people in all areas are urged to remain calm and composed but to maintain vigilance at all times. The government has sufficient power to deal with all emergencies. At 12:45 PM, another broadcast message stated that the capital is currently very peaceful and that rumors of rebel troops occupying the capital are completely unfounded. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the situation in Spain, a telegram from semi-official sources in the capital stated that the government has been able to control the overall situation, that four rebel generals have been arrested, and that the plane used by the rebel leader has been intercepted by the government. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The revolutionary movement initiated by the Spanish Moroccan Legion yesterday has now spread throughout the country with great speed. It is reported that the cities of Melilla and Ceuta in Spanish Morocco have been occupied by the Foreign Legion. A cavalry regiment has been ordered to Seville to suppress the unrest. Troops stationed in Burgos and Pamplona are also said to have rebelled. Disturbances have also occurred on the small islands of the Canary and Balearic Islands. Government aircraft have bombed Melilla and Ceuta. Former Spanish Prime Minister Lerroux has fled to Portugal. British naval and army personnel stationed in Gibraltar have been ordered to refrain from entering Spanish territory from today onwards. The above is the true picture of the current situation in Spain as reported by various sources. However, news coming out of Spain is being heavily censored, making it difficult to ascertain the actual situation. A message from Gibraltar states that according to a Spanish radio station announcement, the government is confident in handling the situation, but a message from a radio station fallen into the hands of the rebels claims that the revolutionaries have won a major victory throughout the country. This afternoon, the government issued a public announcement acknowledging that the disturbances are not limited to Morocco alone and stating that the government has completely recovered certain areas illegally declared under a state of alert by the rebel elements, as well as the small islands of the Balearic and Canary Islands. A message from Madrid this evening acknowledges that Melilla and Ceuta are still occupied by the Foreign Legion, but the authorities express confidence that the disturbances can be completely quelled within 48 hours. According to a report from Madrid, all cities occupied by the rebels have declared a general strike, which proves that the previous reports of unrest on the Balearic and Canary Islands were not rumors. The message also states that two generals were arrested on the Canary Islands. A telegram from Oran reports that news from the Algerian-Moroccan border indicates that government troops and rebel soldiers engaged in fierce fighting, resulting in the deaths of two generals and the capture of more than thirty officers. According to a report from Gibraltar, serious fighting broke out last night between fascists and communists in the city of La Línea near the border, resulting in one death and at least twenty serious injuries. Over a hundred British residents were on their way to the market in La Línea at the time and immediately returned to Gibraltar upon seeing the situation. According to a report from Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, Lerroux, who was responsible for arresting President Azaña last year, has fled from the Spanish border to Portugal. Madrid now announces that the number of dead and wounded in the current disturbances has been very small to date. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Air Force Bombing</h3>
<p>Madrid - Although the Spanish government claims that the center of the serious unrest in Morocco is limited to Seville, Burgos, and Pamplona, there are also various reports coming out stating it will soon spread throughout the country. Government secret agents are currently engaged in searching for the leaders of various fascist and leftist factions throughout the country, as they are suspected of plotting a counter-revolution. This morning, the authorities here issued an official radio message stating that a cavalry regiment has been dispatched to Seville. All workers in areas declared under a state of alert by the anti-government forces have been urged by union leader Caballero, via radio broadcast, to declare... There are indeed several places in Spain with unrest, but they express confidence that this movement will be limited in nature and will not expand. According to government sources, the disturbances in Morocco have been suppressed after several fierce battles between troops loyal to the government and rebel soldiers. Army aircraft have played a major role in this battle. The disturbances broke out yesterday in Melilla and Ceuta in northwestern Spanish Morocco. Twenty thousand soldiers of the Foreign Legion stationed there mutinied. It is said that nine people were killed when residents of Melilla declared a general strike in an attempt to resist the mutineers. Three people were also killed when the disturbance occurred in the local area. The Commissioner's Office has been occupied by the mutineers. After news of the outbreak of the above disturbances reached Madrid, two flagships of the Spanish Navy were immediately dispatched from Cartagena to Morocco, while all troops loyal to the government were also ordered to suppress the unrest. Last night, news was received here that army aircraft were bombing the rebel masses in Melilla and Ceuta. Before long, it was officially confirmed that a strict plan of containment was being adopted to curb the revolutionary movement. A document was published this morning, stating that one foreign aircraft was seized in connection with the disturbances in Morocco. It is said that it was carrying a rebel leader from Morocco to Spain. Yesterday afternoon, the government announced that the rebels had occupied the Ceuta radio station and issued a radio broadcast announcing that disturbances had occurred in Seville, Madrid, and other places. However, according to this morning's bulletin, the whole of Spain is quiet as usual. The rebel party's claim that the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Interior were captured is completely fabricated. Fortunately, the government has taken swift action to deal with the disturbances, which can now be regarded as extinguished. It is reported that a famous right-wing leader has been murdered by the rebel masses, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Last night and this morning, the government officially acknowledged via radio that the rebellion in Morocco has spread to mainland Spain. Initially, it was only claimed that the troops in Seville had rebelled, but it was later acknowledged that it had spread to Malaga and Cádiz. A spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior stated that the momentum of the rebels is gradually weakening. It is reported that forty armed workers forcibly boarded a ship docked in the port of Barcelona, seized fifty rifles, and were then suppressed by the mobile guard team, who recovered the seized firearms. The government ordered the dissolution of the rebel army last night and dismissed the governor of the Canary Islands. At the same time, it used warships to transport an army unit to carry out the duties of the government. Minister of the Interior Moles announced on the radio last night that government aircraft had begun to bomb key rebel locations in Morocco. As for Spain itself, the Minister of the Interior stated that all troops are loyal to the government, so the government has ample power to deal with the incidents in Morocco, and the public should not pay attention to them. The government, in view of the urgency of the situation, has taken decisive measures to arrest several military officers. It is understood that several officers in the navy have also been dismissed for disobeying orders. Airmail throughout Spain has been completely suspended since yesterday, but mail planes from other countries can still land, but only with prior permission. The Minister of the Interior also said that the government had seized a foreign aircraft and would use it to fly to Morocco to bring back a certain rebel leader. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Forces Have Great Momentum</h3>
<p>Gibraltar - It is rumored that the Spanish Moroccan rebel army, which landed in Cádiz today, is now advancing towards Seville, intending to join forces with the rebels there in order to advance on the capital, Madrid. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Tangier, North Africa - According to a broadcast message from Seville, General Del Llano, Deputy Commander of the Seville garrison, has joined the rebel army, calling himself the "Liberation Army" and issuing a proclamation calling on the people to support him. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Radio Propaganda War</h3>
<p>Madrid - Since the mutiny of the garrison in the Spanish Moroccan territory of North Africa, the "United Radio Station" here and the radio station in Ceuta, North Africa, have been issuing reports via radio broadcasts. The former acts as the government's mouthpiece, while the latter has been occupied by the rebel army, and their propaganda is diametrically opposed, with each side engaging in a war of words, as if waging a radio war. For example, the Ceuta radio station issued a message stating that the warships dispatched by the government to patrol the Moroccan coast had fallen into the hands of the rebel army and were now returning to the Spanish coast. The "United Radio Station" immediately issued a broadcast bulletin at 5:15 PM today, denying this claim, stating that the warships were always loyal to the government and were now ordered to proceed to the African coast and would arrive soon. It also said that only a small part of the Moroccan garrison had defected, that the local civil administration was still loyal to the government, that all people should obey the orders of the civil officials, and that no martial law had been declared in Morocco, etc. This bulletin also published a telegram from right-wing member of parliament Lucia expressing loyalty to the government. (Note: Lucia is a member of the Autonomist Party of the Province of France and is affiliated with the Spanish right-wing parties united under the leadership of former Minister of the Army Robles, who is not tolerated by the current government and has already fled to France.) At 7:45 PM, the "United Radio Station" issued another broadcast bulletin, stating that all provinces across the country were now loyal to the government, that the disturbances that had occurred in some cities had been quickly quelled, and that although rebel General Queipo had illegally declared martial law in Seville, his rebel troops had surrendered to government troops, and that a cavalry regiment had entered the city to the cheers of the people, who shouted "Long live the Spanish Republic" to show their welcome. It also stated that the government was now able to completely control the situation. In addition, the socialist trade unions in the capital have decided to automatically hold a general strike in places where martial law has been declared, and will not resume work until order has been restored. This decision has been announced by the leader of the extreme wing of the Socialist Party, Caballero, in the name of various associations and labor organizations, and broadcast by the "United Radio Station" to various locations.

<h3>Key Figures Behind the Coup</h3>
<p>(Paris) A reporter for the Petit Parisien, reporting from Perpignan (near the Spanish border in southern France), stated: "The coup in Spain was initiated by three people: the leader of the right-wing Catholic Party, Robles, General Sanjurjo (who was arrested and sentenced to death in August 1932 for causing unrest, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, and he was only pardoned in April 1934), and the son of former dictator Rivera, who is currently in prison but has prison guards colluding with him. Their planned scheme was to have Sotelo (leader of the monarchist party, recently assassinated) as the leader of the new government. The security forces have agreed to support this, because the security forces are mostly right-wing and have had long-standing conflicts with the left-wing stormtroopers, and thus participated in the coup." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Perpignan, France - The Associated Press recently learned from reliable sources that the mutiny of the garrison in Melilla, Morocco, was actually a nationwide revolutionary plan, which unfortunately erupted prematurely before it was fully developed. According to this plan, it was formed in the home of peasant party leader Robles last month. Among those who participated in the conspiracy were Rivera, the son of the late Spanish dictator, and three army generals and militia officers. Rivera was still in prison for privately storing weapons at the time, but was released by prison guards. The original plan was for the garrisons in Morocco and the Canary Islands to mutiny at the same time, and after succeeding, they would return to their country. At that time, the domestic army would also respond, and a new government would be formed with Conservative Party leader Sotelo as president. However, Sotelo was suddenly assassinated in Madrid on July 13, which led to the premature launch of the Melilla army before the timing was ripe. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Figaro reporter stationed in Madrid, after arriving at the French border, spoke with the newspaper by long-distance telephone. According to him, the plan for the coup in Spain was jointly drafted by the monarchists and the fascists. Its contents are roughly as follows: (1) Start the uprising in the territory of Morocco in North Africa. The officers there are mostly members of the monarchist party. Even the foreign legion and Moorish native soldiers can come out and respond. (2) After Morocco launches the uprising, the government must mobilize a large army to suppress the country's south. Once this unit arrives, it must follow up with a mutiny. (3) Within the mainland, simultaneous uprisings should be held in the west, east, and southeast, and an attack on the city of Madrid should be launched. (A) In the west, a general should sneak into Galicia from Portugal and launch an uprising. (B) In the east, in the province of Pamplona, another general should lead the garrison to resist the government. (C) The garrison in the southeast should also rise up in response. In addition, the rebel side believes that although the government has cut off all telegraphs and telephones, the rebels can mobilize the air force personnel at the Burgos air force base to participate in the rebellion and relay information.

<h3>Where is the Hirota Cabinet Going? (3)</h3>
<p>- Jia He</p>
<p>Hirota seemed not satisfied with the above denials, and was filled with the ambition, singing a duet with Seiyukai's famous liberalist Uehara Etsujiro in the budget meeting. Uehara first affirmatively said, "Those who receive the great command, if they cannot freely choose their cabinet members, then the perfect operation of constitutional politics cannot be expected." Then he talked about Hirota's cabinet formation process, questioning, "What was the Prime Minister's experience in this cabinet formation?"</p>
<p>Hirota replied, "It is possible for those who receive the great command to have someone deemed suitable recommended by the army internally."</p>
<p>"That's probably wrong! According to the practice up to today, the selection of the Minister of the Army is decided and recommended among the three chiefs, that's a well-known fact."</p>
<p>"What I said is not wrong."</p>
<p>Uehara then questioned, "The world generally believes that there is a military department outside the government... what is the Prime Minister's view?" Hirota resolutely answered him, "I have heard people say that, and I intend to work hard to ensure that such a thing does not happen." This kind of strong argument that completely obliterates the facts is to show the military department that today's Hirota is not the Hirota of the past. Therefore, when Mimuroto Keikozi re-submitted the question of the state of mind of cabinet formation on May 12, he told the House of Peers about the situation of Kusunoki's sword breaking and arrows running out at Minatogawa. We know that when Kusunoki Masashige devoted his loyalty to the Japanese imperial family, there was already a struggle between the Northern and Southern Dynasties. We do not yet know the detailed inside story of the "February 26th" coup, but isn't it strange that Hirota Kōki dares to claim to be Kusunoki Masashige? Please chew on this carefully, every expert.</p>
<p>The Hirota Cabinet not only denied its raped-like ambition when forming the cabinet in front of the parliament, but also joined hands with political parties to question the military department and criticize the military department. The most brilliant was the speech by Saito Takao of the Minseito Party. This speech with a historical mission was published by the newspapers of Japanese property owners in extremely large coverage. Except for Murobuse Takashin's sarcastic "Its sound is sad" (read the evening edition of May 12), the Osaka Mainichi praised it as "the voice of the people" (May 9). The Toa Asahi called it "Every sentence is the word of the people." An unprecedented emotion was reflected in the parliament, and regardless of faction, they responded with warm applause. Ando Masazumi (Seiyukai), who originally planned to deliver the same speech, also automatically withdrew.</p>
<p>Saito Takao used beautiful words to point out the following points: "First is the interference of the military in politics." He said, "It is an indisputable fact that active-duty soldiers talk about politics and participate in political activities. What attitude will the military department take towards this?" He first quoted the Meiji Emperor's decree to the military and Ito Hirobumi's constitutional interpretation to prove that soldiers cannot interfere in politics. Then, righteously, he put the big hat of violating the imperial decree on the head of the military, and also pointed out that soldiers have simple thoughts and cannot cope with complex social situations, are easily used by others, and even resort to direct action. "May 15th" is a living proof. After this conclusion, he turned around and asked General Terauchi, "What is the Minister of the Army's opinion on this point?" Second, he criticized the military department's attitude towards handling every major incident. He quoted the famous author of Nihon Gaishi, Rai Sanyo, criticizing the reason why medieval regimes were handed over to the military: "The successive dynasties" adopted an attitude of appeasement and leniency towards the Minamoto and Taira clans, and did not know the foundation and "the disaster of fighting and seizing" to warn the Minister of the Army, and shouted, "If soldiers form a party and openly break into the Prime Minister's official residence in broad daylight and shoot the Prime Minister of the country appointed by His Majesty the Emperor, seize the weapons given to them for the purpose of protecting the country, and assassinate the highest-ranking minister of the country in charge of political affairs, the seriousness of the crime, "Indeed there is no need to dwell on it." He also painfully revealed how the army destroyed the country's legal dignity and criticized the military department for harming Yamamoto, the prosecutor who advocated bringing the participants in the coup to justice during the "May 15th" incident. Finally, he drew the conclusion of the coup responsibility: "The military department's attitude towards a certain incident sighed out the ×× incident; the military department's attitude towards the ×× incident called out the "May 15th" incident; the military department's attitude towards the "May 15th" incident really caused a major ominous event." Third, he publicly stated that recent young people's behavior, "one is carried out in the name of patriotism, and one is carried out in the name of the proletariat." Both this right-leaning and left-leaning are harmful to the country's great cause of constitutional monarchy, and there is absolutely no way for our people to advance beyond this."; and revealed the mission of the current stage of the Hirota cabinet. Fourth, he seemed to face the Seiyukai parliamentary seat and shouted, "If politicians other than the military department collude with a part of the military department and conspire and want to carry out political ambitions, if there are such people, then they must not be let go. If a constitutional politician takes the people as the background, they should stand upright in front of the masses, plan for the country, and engage in political strife with fair and just means. As for plotting behind the scenes and attempting unstable conspiracies, they must not be allowed by constitutional politicians."</p>

<h3>The Rapid Advancement of Soviet Aviation; Air Force Strength Surpasses European and American Powers; Civilian Activities Repeatedly Set Impressive Records</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from the China United Press: The Soviet government's efforts to promote aviation have been tireless, and the results have surpassed those of European and American powers, making it a world-class aviation nation. Recalling the period after the October Revolution, the entire country was in a state of chaos, and all industries were in decline. By 1921, the government, recognizing that the Soviet Union was a vast continental nation, considered the construction of an air force to be a matter of urgency to protect the victory of the revolution and defend against foreign aggression. Therefore, a plan was established and actively implemented. Non-military aviation activities did not begin until 1923, lasting only fourteen years. As a result, it now dominates the world of aviation. Its spirit of striving for progress is truly worthy of emulation. Therefore, the current state of aviation in the country is introduced below, so that those concerned about national defense issues may be alerted.</p>
<p>Air Force Power</p>
<p>In 1922, the Soviet Air Force had only 20 land-based squadrons. By 1925, it had increased to 80 squadrons, and in 1928, it increased to 100 squadrons. Now it has reached more than 350 squadrons, with over 4,000 aircraft. The increase and development of fighter planes and bombers are particularly astonishing. It is estimated that after the success of the Second Five-Year Plan, it will reach as many as 8,000 aircraft. The various materials for expanding the air force were purchased from Germany, Italy, England, and France, and specialists were hired from these countries to be responsible for building aircraft factories. However, after the success of the First Five-Year Plan, due to the active promotion of the development of the aviation industry and its raw material resources, and the large-scale training of technical specialists, it is now able to completely manufacture new and advanced aircraft itself. The most distinctive feature of the Soviet Air Force is the airborne landing force and the troop transport aircraft currently under construction. Moreover, parachute technology is extremely widespread in the country, something that European and American countries cannot match. This airborne landing force is intended to outflank the enemy's rear. The exercise held near the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, Kyiv, last September was very successful, and the people of the world were greatly impacted at the time.</p>
<p>Civil Aviation</p>
<p>The Soviet government's planning and management of civil aviation construction, such as the opening of air routes and the training of aviators, are also centered on national defense, so that they can be quickly converted to military use in case of emergency. According to the authorities, in 1923, the country had only 12 foreign-made aircraft, and the total length of air routes was only 1,666 kilometers. The total number of passengers throughout the year was only 3,000, and the amount of goods transported was 21,291 grams. But by the end of 1935, the number of aircraft had increased to thousands, and the total length of air routes had reached 77,000 kilometers. According to statistics, the total number of passengers last year was 111,000, the amount of mail transported was 6,600 tons, and the amount of goods was 5,000 tons. Comparing these huge numbers with those of twelve years ago reveals the speed of its advancement and development.</p>
<p>Special Contributions</p>
<p>Soviet civilian aircraft are not only used for transportation and traffic, but are also very active in special work and have made great contributions, such as photographic surveying, Arctic exploration, capturing fish and marine animals, eliminating pests, and sowing seeds. Excellent results have been achieved in all of these areas. According to statistics, last year a total of 35 million hectares of forest area were surveyed, 120,000 hectares of fields were sown, 560,000 hectares of agricultural and forestry pests and animals were eliminated, and 2,435,000 hectares of "malaria mosquitoes" were eliminated.</p>
<p>Setting New Records</p>
<p>Under the promotion and encouragement of the government, the Soviet people have a strong interest in aviation and often create impressive new records. Important achievements include staying in the air for 75 hours, flying a long distance of 12,411 kilometers, ascending to an altitude of 11,080 meters, performing a parachute jump of 7,612 meters, and stratospheric flights of 15,000 meters. All of these broke previous world or Soviet records and won warm praise from the global aviation community.</p>
<p>Arctic Flight</p>
<p>In addition to enriching and expanding its domestic aviation industry, the Soviet authorities also devoted all their efforts to the development of Arctic air routes. As a result, Molokov completed the flight from Moscow via Sverdlovsk, Skrobirsk, Kurasloselsk, and Iolkatuvdinka to Jingksheng Island. At the same time, aviators Viatapiyalov and Lin Qili also completed the voyage between Moscow and Simit Bay, a distance of 13,500 kilometers. All of these have written a glorious page in the history of Soviet aviation, providing a strong impetus for backward countries.</p>

<h3>Flooding in Hebei Province; Daming City Surrounded by Water; Torrential Floods Make Rescue Impossible; Traffic Cut Off and Food Prices Soar</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Cangxian city river was backflowing from the rising waters of the Grand Canal, and the water was surging. At 6:00 AM on the 18th, 60 zhang of the new dike at Xingjiazhuang collapsed. The water is flowing in the ocean, and the plains are four or five feet deep. Dozens of villages along the river have been flooded. County Magistrate Yu Zhenqing led the militia to the area on the 19th to gather civilians to reinforce the dike. The water in the Zhang River in southern Hebei is rising again. More than a hundred villages in the old levee area of the first, second, and third districts of Daming County, such as Shuangjing Town, have been submerged. The torrential floods are impossible to rescue. Daming County is now in the center of the water. County Magistrate Ma Runchang, in cooperation with Chen Chunrong's brigade of the 29th Army and Ma Shibin's troops of the Ninth Security District, mobilized the entire force for rescue. The current water level in the city river continues to rise. The Western school yard has been submerged. Soldiers and civilians are defending day and night. The Da-Han-Ping and Da-Liang motorways have been submerged, cutting off external traffic, and food prices are soaring. Residents are panicking. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The rising water of the South Canal is depositing silt downstream, raising the Hai River by one foot in five days. All dredging vessels have been mobilized to dredge. Giant ships with a draft of more than 14 feet have stopped sailing to Tianjin. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar Association plans to take over the dredging of the Hai River from the North China Water Conservancy Bureau, and the powers and responsibilities will be assigned to the Construction Committee of the Association.

<h3>Smuggled Artificial Silk Made into Bolts of Cloth and Sold as Local Products in the Interior; The Silk Industry is Also Affected</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In the past, unscrupulous merchants and Japanese ruffians smuggled a large number of artificial silk to Zhoucun County and other places along the Jiaoji Railway, made them into bolts of cloth, and sold them as local products in the interior to avoid the attention of the customs. As a result, the sales of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have also been encroached upon recently. It is expected that after the implementation of the inspection and handling measures for the artificial silk purchased by each factory and the bolts of cloth made of artificial silk or mixed with artificial silk and sold as local products, which will be promulgated by the Ministry of Finance this time, the aforementioned disguised smuggling can be stopped. In other news, the Customs Anti-Smuggling General Inspection Office for Road Transportation has established anti-smuggling sub-offices along the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways. However, the Beijing-Shenyang Railway is still lacking, so smuggling on that railway is still rampant, and legitimate commercial interests, both Chinese and foreign, are suffering. The Japanese legitimate merchants in particular have suffered severe losses. It is reported that the government has indeed made arrangements for anti-smuggling measures on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, which will be implemented within days. It is still undetermined when Ansell will go north. (CNA dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In order to prevent Japanese ruffians from relying on Fengtai on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway as a center to forcibly transport smuggled goods to the Pinghan and Pingsui Railways, Tianjin Customs is negotiating with the Beijing-Shenyang Railway to establish an inspection sub-office in Yangcun. The railway side agrees that as long as the diplomatic difficulties are overcome, they can assist. This matter will be discussed and decided after Ansell arrives in Tianjin. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because the customs has designated the raw materials for artificial silk woven goods as smuggled goods, the factories weaving these goods have been ordered to pay supplementary taxes before exporting them. Dozens of factories in Tianjin that are engaged in this industry have been shut down. The factory side has again submitted a petition to the Tianjin Customs Supervision Department, stating that there is no place to purchase legitimate artificial silk other than smuggled goods. If the government does not have a fundamental method to suppress smuggled goods, all factories will be forced to shut down. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Provincial Government Cables Yan to Accept Refugees from Shanxi to Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) In the third and fourth months of this year, when the Red bandits fled from Shanxi to northern Shaanxi, they coerced many good people from southern Shanxi.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Singapore to the Shen Bao and other newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai for public consideration: Our association recently sent a telegram to Chen, Li, and Bai in the Southwest, which read: "Reports state that the Southwest is resisting the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, regardless of the desperate gamble. Now, resistance against Japan is in a dilemma, and civil war is obviously treasonous. The strong and the weak are unmatched, and the outcome has been decided. What good will stubborn resistance do in the end? Although your personal safety can be temporarily secured in a foreign land, can your merits and demerits escape historical judgment? Moreover, once the war begins, it will bring immense devastation. The ancestral graves will be reduced to areas of smoke and fire. Is this the way patriots and people of benevolence should act? The resolutions of the Second Plenary Session still show respect. If you can pull back from the brink and maintain the current situation, you will still be regarded as insightful and outstanding people. We have a sense of danger and cannot remain silent. We offer our loyal advice again and earnestly ask you to make a choice." Chairman of the Singapore Overseas Chinese General Assembly, Chen Jiageng, He Siguan, Chen Laichang, bow respectfully.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying</p>
<p>The Unfortunate Women of Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Starting from Lanxi's West Gate, walking along the riverside to the South Gate, and looking southwest across the river, there's a shuttle-shaped green mountain called Hengshan. It's a crucial convergence point for the Changshan, Quzhou, Gangtou, and Wu Gang rivers. At the mountain's eastern foot and halfway up, there are temples. Emperor Wuzong of the Ming Dynasty inscribed the four characters "Lanyin Shenchu" (Deep Seclusion of Lanxi) on the mountainside's stone wall. Bringing your gaze back, you see the green mountain and white temple reflected in the river. With the occasional sails, it truly resembles a beautiful painting of misty light and cloud shadows. If you bring your gaze even closer, you'll surely notice many painted boats leaning against the shore and countless small teahouses hanging low along the riverbank. These are the pleasure grounds where wealthy merchants indulge in sensual desires, and also the sinful places where unfortunate women are forced to sell their bodies.</p>
<p>It's unknown when flower boats first appeared in Lanxi. However, according to records, they started during the Hong Yang period (Taiping Rebellion). This place is a major land and water transportation hub in eastern Zhejiang, and its commerce is increasingly prosperous. Around 1919 and 1920, there were as many as ninety flower boats, which could be considered the peak of the industry. Later, in 1927, due to the impact of military affairs, the boats were moved to pontoon bridges, and the flower boats suffered as collateral damage. Furthermore, with the construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the number of tourists sharply decreased, and the flower boat business declined dramatically. Last autumn, there were still twenty-seven boats, but now that number has decreased to twenty. Each flower boat has five or six young women, commonly called "boat girls" or "female boat owners" (meaning "female signboard"). Tourists can sit on the boat for a while and be offered tea and cigarettes without spending money. However, if they eat a banquet, request songs, or play mahjong, they often spend lavishly. But in reality, it ultimately has a great negative impact on good morals. The county government once planned to strictly ban them, but feared that the boat owners and boat girls would be unable to make a living, so they could only adopt a gradual policy, hoping to remedy the situation slowly. Currently, all the boat girls on each boat are bought by the boat owners as "adopted daughters" from poor and remote villages at a young age. On the surface, their lives seem to be spent in romantic and carefree pursuits, but the suffering they actually endure is a living hell on earth. In addition, upstream counties also have flower boats, which are similarly affected by the decline in commerce, further deepening their tragic fate of inhumane living.</p>
<p>The row of teahouses along the river in Lanxi is built on the riverbank, with the buildings seven or eight steps lower than the street. If you go to drink tea, it's more accurate to say you're going downstairs rather than upstairs. As soon as tourists enter a teahouse and recline on a chair, the local tea girls (about four or five of them) swarm around you, pouring tea and shelling melon seeds, trying to seduce customers in any way they can. If there's more than one tea guest, they seem especially busy, rushing back and forth like a revolving lantern. If the guest wants a cigarette, they magically light the match and quickly light the cigarette you're holding in your mouth. Even more artistically, they perfectly cover the bottom of the plate with a layer of melon seeds, no more, no less. Before you finish the first two plates, the next two are brought out simultaneously. You can only eat so much, but they, as a group, don't hesitate to eat and hide the seeds. In no time, the empty plates are stacked into two pagodas, showing that the income from melon seeds alone is considerable, not to mention the extra tips. According to a gentleman from the county's chamber of commerce, there are about two hundred such teahouses. The leisure and pleasure of the tourists who come to drink tea lies not in the tea itself, but in another realm. The tea girls are also poor women from the countryside, hired by the teahouses with a monthly salary of only three or four yuan. Their hopes for extra income are very low, so many young men who indulge in pleasure fall into the vast river outside the teahouse and can't extricate themselves. The county government has now taken measures to improve the situation, prohibiting them from picking up or seeing off guests outside the teahouse. The reason for this "prohibition" is that there's more to it than just picking up and seeing off guests. Teahouses in neighboring counties, such as Jinhua, Longyou, and Jiangshan, have also suffered from this spreading disease. Recently, an assassination case occurred in Qu County, which was found to be related to teahouse waitresses. Due to the strict ban by the local garrison, the flowers of the teahouses, like lost dogs, have had to flee to neighboring counties. Lanxi, as their birthplace, is especially hoped for, but even with strong defenses, it's impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Lanxi and Jinhua counties still have the bad custom of "valuing men over women," which is also a factor in creating "boat girls," "tea girls," and "local prostitutes." Generally, middle-class families are unwilling to raise too many girls, and poor farmers are even more unwilling to raise girls. Therefore, when a girl is born, they are sometimes treated with barbaric methods (the county government has already issued a notice prohibiting this), or secretly abandoned in front of wealthy families' doors, or the infant is left to the orphanage after sending a letter to inform them. In recent years, as more nannies have been hired in Shanghai and other ports, there have been more abandoned children here.</p>
<p>In particular, the customs in various villages are not open, and marriage is mainly based on money. It's commonly said that it's harder for poor families to marry a wife than to buy farmland. For the sake of future planning, parents are happy to raise child brides. Generally, child brides are sent to their future husband's families a few months after birth and raised by the in-laws from a young age, which is better treatment. If they are older, there is more likely to be emotional distance, and they are not treated as well as the family's own children, at least not as well as their own sons and daughters. Usually, when giving a daughter to someone as a child bride, they even have to subsidize them with dozens of yuan for living expenses. In Gansu's Western Road, the parents of child brides charge a dowry based on age at a rate of one yuan per year of age, which is already considered very unreasonable. But here, the bride's family even has to pay for living expenses, which is even more outrageous. In Lanxi and Jinhua, if daughters are lucky enough to grow up and get married in a palanquin woven by the "parents' orders and matchmaker's words," the old-fashioned etiquette can be very dizzying. For example, when the bride's family helps her into the palanquin, the mother cries with snot and tears, saying things like "Stepping on the stairs, step by step higher," "Give birth to a noble son and repay your mother's kindness." But at that time, the person helping the bride is afraid that if they are not careful, the bride's foot will step on the family's land, which would be unfavorable to the family. For the matchmakers and porters who come to greet the bride, even on extremely cold winter nights, they are not allowed to light a fire, fearing that it would harm the bride's family's wealth. With such superstitious contradictions, how can it be said to be marrying a "person"?</p>
<p>There is also the practice of "mortgaging wives" to others to have children. This evil custom of treating one's only wife as a sowing machine is most common in Qingtian, which belongs to the old Chuzhou (Lishui), and Dongyang in the Jinqu area. Because people who have property but no children and no possibility of taking a concubine come up with the idea of renting a wife to have children. The rent is a one-time payment of one hundred or ten yuan, or several tens of yuan per year for a period of three to five years. Whether the rented wife lives in your home or in her original husband's home is uncertain, but during this period, the ownership of the children born belongs to the person who paid for the wife's mortgage. As for those who mortgage their wives, it can be inferred that they are mostly families with many children who lack food and clothing. Although this is permitted by local customs, there is a different kind of bitterness in their hearts. Now, due to the development of transportation and the gradual opening of customs, the above-mentioned evil customs will naturally be gradually banned and eliminated.</p>
<p>The folk songs that are popular in each place usually fully and naturally reveal the people's thoughts, habits, and living conditions in that place. There are also many folk songs popular in various regions of Lanxi. Here are a few selected:</p>
<p>(1) At the age of ten, I married a seven-year-old boy. During the day, I dress him and send him to school. At night, I take off his shoes and socks and carry him to bed. He sleeps at my head, without discussion. After sleeping, I'm afraid the rats will carry him over the wall. Long bamboo poles for drying clothes, short bamboo poles for writing articles. I don't blame my grandfather, I don't blame my mother, I don't blame the little boy, I blame my own bad fate. I can only weep secretly until dawn.</p>
<p>(2) Big sparrow, long tail. Married a wife and forgot my mother. Early son, early profit. Early wife, early anger.</p>
<p>(3) One son, worry and fear. Two sons, icing on the cake. Three sons become four families. More sons and more daughters, more grievances. (This is the reality, but mostly due to the poison of inheritance.) One son and one daughter, a flower. No sons and no daughters, like immortals.</p>
<p>(4) January, accompany guests. February, weed wheat. March, go hungry. April, have wheat to grind. May, suffer. June, rice to the belly. July, fan. August, opera. September, drag shoes. October, grab firewood. November, suffer anger. December, be emperor. (This is a sketch of a farmer's life throughout the year, but "be emperor" does not mean a fat year, it is a euphemism for "avoiding debts.")</p>
<p>(5) Daughter dear, but not dear. A full dowry is still considered light. Son dear, but not dear. Three sentences and his face turns west. Husband and wife dear, but not dear. Same bed, same quilt, two minds. Brothers dear, but not dear. One bowl brought, one bowl invited. Only copper coins and silver are truly dear. Use them whenever you need to go.</p>
<p>(6) Three people, one heart, gold everywhere. (The effect of cooperation is like this. Don't laugh at the old farmer's ignorance.)</p>

<h3>Expansion of the Japanese Army in North China</h3>
<p>Reorganization Implemented on August 1st, Tokuwo Watanabe Appointed Chief of Staff</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Since Wanichiro Tashiro took office as the commander of the Japanese North China Garrison, its organization has been strengthened due to the increase in troops. The commander is of the rank of lieutenant general, and the chief of staff is of the rank of major general. The current chief of staff, Toshihide Nagami, is officially a colonel. According to custom, he will either be promoted or transferred, and a new officer will be appointed by the Japanese military headquarters to replace him. It was rumored a month ago that Nagami would be promoted to major general during the regular troop movements in August and remain in his original position. However, it has recently been learned that this is not accurate. Nagami belongs to the far-left faction of young officers, and his political views often differ from those of Tashiro and some members of the Japanese military headquarters. Tashiro wants to effectively direct operations, so he wants Nagami transferred. Tokuwo Watanabe, head of the Second Department of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, came to negotiate the matter, with an accompanying mission being to change the chief of staff. After Watanabe returns home and reports, the matter will be largely decided. Watanabe will succeed as chief of staff. Nagami, due to his familiarity with the situation in North China, will be transferred to the post of director of the Japanese special service agency in Taiyuan, remaining in North China. The Japanese military headquarters recently felt that the authority of the Japanese North China Garrison should be increased and the organization should be improved. Therefore, it simultaneously ordered that the organization be modeled after the Japanese Kwantung Army, with seven departments under the commander: staff, adjutant, manager, translator, military doctor, veterinarian, and economic advisor. The staff department is divided into three sections and an intelligence system. Iida Yasujiro, the current senior staff officer of the Japanese North China Garrison, will serve as the head of the First Section. Kazuji Wachi, the current director of the Taiyuan special service agency, will be transferred to the post of head of the Second Section. He will be promoted to colonel during the regular troop movements in August. The head of the Third Section has not yet been determined and will be a colonel-level officer familiar with the situation in North China, dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of the Army. The original senior staff officer, Yoshie Ishii, will be transferred to the General Staff Headquarters in Japan. The original staff officer of the garrison, Yoshihide Hayashi (head of the investigation team), will be transferred to Shanghai to serve as an assistant military attaché at the embassy. The adjutant department will have communications and investigation teams, also headed by senior officers. The official announcement can be made at the end of this month and implemented on August 1st. This is slightly different from the previous organization. The commander of the Japanese North China Garrison now has the ability to independently exercise military power.</p>
<p>The Greater Asia Association, organized by General Iwane Matsui, advocates the so-called unity of East Asian nations and joint defense against the eastward advance of white people. A branch has been established in Tianjin. When the puppet autonomous movement was rampant, the association planned to hold a meeting in Dalian to promote autonomy. However, because it was unsuccessful, Matsui has now sent the association's director, Shumei Okawa, to Nanyang and the Philippines to contact local people and reopen a Greater Asia National Congress. The location will be in Beiping or Tianjin. Representatives from Manchukuo and Hebei-East Hebei will participate. Okawa is about to finish his activities in Nanyang and will return to Dalian at the end of the month. He will first hold a preparatory meeting in Dalian and come to Tianjin in early June to contact all parties. If the circumstances allow, the meeting can be convened in September or October of this year. (17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Invest in North China's Industries</h3>
<p>Mitsui and Other Foreign Firms Deeply Affected by Smuggling, Plan to Jointly Operate Factories in Tianjin; Baocheng Yarn Factory Auctioned Off to Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Smuggling by ronin in North China is considered a source of distress and pain even by legitimate merchants in their own country. However, this is one of the strategies in the larger sense of policy, and legitimate merchants have to endure their sufferings in silence. It has recently been learned that the Mitsui and Mitsubishi firms, as well as the Okura Company, were originally giant import and export trading houses, whose monthly sales of goods in North China averaged more than 1.3 million yuan. Since the rampant smuggling, all legitimate commodities imported by these firms have been piled up in warehouses and cannot be sold. The volume of trade has plummeted from the thaw of the Dagu port in March to the present, falling to about 200,000 yuan per month. The trading firms are almost unable to sustain themselves. In fact, the smuggling life is not decent, and they cannot imitate it, so they can only let themselves suffer losses. Recently, the firms have realized that if things continue in this way, their business will come to a standstill. Therefore, they convened a special meeting and decided to adopt a joint business approach. All artificial silk, piece goods, soda water, porcelain, glass, beer, and other items that need to be imported with high tariffs will be manufactured locally in factories in Tianjin and Yu, saving on tariffs and freight costs. The cost will be lower, which can compete with smuggled goods. This will also save face for the three firms. Currently, the selected sites are mostly rented vacant land on both sides of the Hai River in the Chengtangzhuang and Guajiasi areas in the suburbs of Tianjin, and construction will begin in the shortest time. Among them, Mitsubishi is more experienced in running a glass factory and may create one independently, starting construction ahead of the others. According to their investigation, there are thirteen glass factories in Tianjin, including Yaohua, but their capital is not strong and their products are not of high quality. If they invest 500,000 yuan to set up a factory, they will surely be able to reap great profits. Even if Chinese-run factories do not resist, it will be difficult for them to survive.</p>
<p>Shanzhong, the director of the Shanzhong Iron and Steel Plant in Shenyang, came to North China to investigate a month ago and learned that the sales of aluminum-zinc iron sheets (i.e., iron tiles) required by the construction industry in North China are very good. Therefore, he contacted the South Manchuria Railway Company to obtain its assistance in setting up a branch factory in Tianjin. He has already purchased 1,500 mu of private land near the Yuda Spinning Factory in Xiaoliuzhuang, downstream of the Hai River, and construction will begin next month. The project will be completed by November at the latest, and the first batch of goods can be produced by the end of the year. The minimum production capacity is 1,500 tons per month. The current Tianjin market sells 200 to 300 tons per month. In the future, the factory will contact the Okura and Mitsui firms to promote sales, with a minimum of 300 tons per month. In six or seven months, sales can reach 500 to 600 tons. It is said that the factory will also manufacture enamel porcelain. If the business is successful, the British and German commercial markets in North China can be replaced.</p>
<p>Since the news of the sale of the Huaxin Yarn Factory spread, the Japanese companies Xingzhong, Okura, Da-Nippon Spinning, Kanebo, and Toyo Spinning have all been in contact to buy it. Huaxin demanded that regardless of who buys it, they must sign an agreement guaranteeing that workers cannot be laid off for at least six months and that staff cannot be laid off for at least three months before other issues can be discussed. Therefore, all buyers considered this a prerequisite for the purchase. Currently, they are discussing the matter. The Huaxin shareholders intend to hold an auction in the same way that the Baocheng Yarn Factory was sold, starting with a minimum price of 1.2 million yuan, allowing buyers to openly compete. It is scheduled to be implemented at the end of the month. The factory has more than 2,000 workers. It is said that after hearing about the factory's sale, they were all panicked and sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition, saying that the factory was not losing money and that some shareholders wanted to sell it to foreigners due to disagreements among the shareholders. They asked the authorities to send someone to investigate and prohibit them from selling it to foreigners to avoid oppression of the Chinese yarn factory. The Bureau of Social Affairs has agreed to investigate. As for the Baocheng Yarn Factory, it went bankrupt due to excessive foreign debt. Recently, shareholders asked creditors to liquidate it and then sell it. Any surplus would be returned to shareholders proportionally. After the liquidation by the banking creditor group, no one bought it for a while. Therefore, it was publicly auctioned at the Xinhua Building in the French Concession on the 16th. The Japanese trading houses Yuda, Okura, and Kanebo Spinning competed to buy it. The Yuda Yarn Factory, which was run by the Japanese and was closed down, was sold for 1.37 million yuan. The procedures will be completed next week. Yuda plans to start work in September and will be named a branch factory. The factory will now fulfill its 40,000-spindle ambition. Baocheng has 25,000 spindles and the machinery is older than that of Huaxin and Yuda. It owes more than 2 million in foreign debt. This sale will use the proceeds to repay the creditors proportionally. The shareholders will only be relieved of their debts. (Hai 18th)</p>
<h3>Second Phase of the Lu-Huang Canal Intermodal Project, Adding Irrigation Tunnels to Drain Water from the Canal's West Slope, Economic Commission Allocates 180,000 Yuan to Assist</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The Shandong Huang Canal intermodal project previously received an appropriation of 260,000 yuan from the National Economic Commission and 110,000 yuan from the province itself. All projects, such as the Weijiashan pumping station and the Zhougong River irrigation tunnel, have been decisively underway. Now, the Huang Canal intermodal project office believes that the first phase of the project is about to be completed and the second phase of the project should be prepared for. However, the original project plan only focused on navigation due to budget cuts. The irrigation tunnels for draining water from the canal's west slope were not built. Now, after the Huang Canal intermodal project office conducted an on-site survey of the terrain, they believed that if the irrigation tunnels are not built, the canal water will be high and slope water will not be able to enter the canal. If the canal water level is lowered as much as possible to allow slope water to enter the canal, the canal water will be shallow, which will hinder navigation. For the sake of both flood control and navigation, it is necessary to build irrigation tunnels. In addition to the two irrigation tunnels that have already been built in the Zhougong River, 14 more irrigation tunnels need to be added. Three tunnels need to be built at the intersection of the south branch of the Tuohai River and the Si River, three tunnels at the intersection of the north branch of the Tuohai River and the canal, one tunnel at the intersection of the north branch of the Majia River and the canal, and two tunnels at Zhang Guantang. Including the repair of three bridges and supervision fees, the total cost is 256,892 yuan in national currency. However, the province's financial resources are insufficient to allocate funds. The flood control project cannot be carried out. Although navigation can be勉强carried out, the waterlogging along the canal will inevitably be difficult to avoid. Therefore, they immediately drafted the second phase of the project plan, charts, and budget, and submitted them to the Department of Construction, which forwarded them to the National Economic Commission, requesting that this fund be included in the water conservancy project budget for the 25th year and continue to be allocated to avoid 工亏一篑.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction received the charts from the Huang Canal intermodal project office and deemed the addition of irrigation tunnels to drain water from the canal's west slope to be extremely important. There were some discrepancies in the proposed second phase of the project plan and budget. Therefore, it immediately sent a letter to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and forwarded it to the National Economic Commission, requesting permission to include it in the water conservancy project budget for the 25th year and allocate funds to facilitate the project. It is now learned that this fund was approved at the National Water Conservancy Conference held in Beijing on the 16th, and 180,000 yuan will be allocated to assist. With this assistance, the second phase of the Huang Canal intermodal project will be able to continue to be completed. (17th)</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Deputy Captain Gao Transferred to Wu County</h3>
<p>Zong Han, the deputy captain of the 9th Security Brigade stationed in Kunshan, has served for more than four years. On the 18th, he received an order from the province to be transferred to the 7th Security Brigade in Wu County. The vacant position will be filled by Zhu Huang. It is learned that Gao will leave for Suzhou to take up his new post after the newly appointed Deputy Captain Zhu comes to Kunshan to complete the handover.</p>
<p>The facilities of the county's prisons and detention centers need more attention. In order to improve the government, the county government is preparing to organize a Prison Improvement Association, with the heads of various agencies and organizations as members and County Magistrate Peng Baichuan as the chairman. After active preparations, it has been established.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Mass Literacy Class Graduates</h3>
<p>The mass literacy class sponsored by the 14 towns in the first district here has completed its four-month training period. The first class held a joint graduation ceremony at Xiaoyao You this morning, the 18th. Various sectors donated many prizes, which were personally awarded and distributed by the county magistrate. It is learned that this first class had a total of 39 classes with 1,132 students. At the same time, it can be known that in the past four months, the first district has added more than 1,100 literate people. Therefore, the graduation ceremony was solemn. In addition to the speeches by the county magistrate and district chief, student representatives gave responses. The awards were given and the event ended at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: Robbery of Cigarettes Solved</h3>
<p>In order to expand its business, the Shanghai Yongtaihe Cigarette Company recently sent a team to Pudong to sell cigarettes such as Lao Dao and Xiannv. Unexpectedly, they encountered a robbery in the Huangpu River a few days ago, and 39 boxes of cigarettes were stolen. The team reported the incident to the Jianghai Customs Water Police Station for investigation. Three suspects, Gu Sanlang and others, were arrested. They confessed that they conspired with Zhang Cailin of Jiajialong, Zhoupu Town, and Shen Jialu of Beicai Town, both in the fifth district of this county. Chief Detective Cheng Yongnian, Detective Gu Wenkui, and six others were dispatched to Zhoupu, together with Sun Yunda, the patrol officer of the Public Security Sub-Station in the town, to arrest Zhang Cailin. They then went to Beicai and arrested Shen Jialu. They also learned that the stolen goods were hidden in the home of Pan Shukui in Xiukang Township. When the detectives went to Pan's house, Pan was not there, but they found 25 boxes of the original stolen cigarettes in the tomb house of Dai Zhenchang, east of Pan's house. Yesterday, the people and stolen goods were escorted to the county for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Smuggling Intercepted at Fengjing Station</h3>
<p>On the 12th, Fengjing East Station intercepted 200 bags of smuggled fertilizer from Shanghai, worth more than 5,000 yuan. The brands include Hengfeng (117 bags), Gongfeng (28 bags), Haisenji (20 bags), and other brands (more than 30 bags).</p>
<h3>Expediting Deed Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The county government believes that property owners often delay reporting taxes after acquiring property, which greatly affects tax revenue. It has ordered the director of the Joint Office for Township Construction in the First District in Xiangfeng to also serve as the deed tax collection officer for the entire county. Each township will hire assistant collection officers in their respective areas to strictly investigate and report. They will be rewarded with a percentage of the fines collected. In order to facilitate property owners in reporting taxes, specific flexible measures have been determined: (1) If the grain string is not brought during the registration of the deed, but the name of the original grain payer is recorded in the deed, verification with the register should be allowed for tax reporting. (2) Land that has been missed or is outside the boundary should be reported voluntarily in accordance with the Qingzhang method, and one year of grain tax should be allowed to be paid retroactively.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Garrison Executes Traitors</h3>
<p>The 87th Division of the garrison successively arrested three traitors, Li Huaqing, He Shugao (from Taixing, unemployed), and Zhao Guangshun (from Yangzhou, street performer), in its defense area. They confessed to infiltrating the defense area to侦察military information. At about 10:00 AM on the 18th, they were escorted to Junsan, outside the north gate, and executed by shooting in accordance with military law.</p>
<h3>Preparing for County Hospital</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs ordered County Magistrate Yuan to convert the existing Opium Treatment Center into a county hospital within a short period. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yuan began preparations and the Administrative Council decided that the hospital will be located at the original site of the Opium Treatment Center (Guanyue Temple). On the 17th, the Department of Civil Affairs appointed Shi Zizhu, the director of the Opium Treatment Center, as the director of the preparatory committee for the county hospital.</p>
<h3>Russian Opportunistic Theft</h3>
<p>North Outer City Walls: At approximately 4 PM on the 17th, three Russian nationals, men and women, arrived in a small car at Baochang Grain and Tobacco Shop outside the north city walls. They attempted to purchase cigarettes, offering a ten-yuan Central Bank note and requesting change specifically in five-yuan and four one-yuan notes. The shop, lacking the requested denominations, suggested exchanging the note at Wang Qiaji Rice Mill. The Russians proceeded to the rice mill, but it also lacked Central Bank notes. The Russians then picked through the bills at the mill, taking their original note back. Afterward, it was discovered that forty-five yuan in Central Bank notes was missing. A pursuit was immediately launched, but the Russians had already fled in their car.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Battle Between Soldiers and Bandits in Dalu Town</h3>
<p>A soldier from the county security team in Dalu Town, Fifth District of the county, noticed a suspicious-looking individual on the street the other day and reported it to his unit. Platoon Leader Tao led a team to investigate. Upon realizing they were discovered, the bandit and his gang opened fire, resisting arrest. The troops immediately returned fire, and a battle ensued for several minutes. One bandit was killed on the spot, and a box gun was seized. A search was then conducted along the Xin'gang River, where a small boat was discovered, along with another box gun, over one hundred packs of cigarettes, and several bolts of cloth. One bandit and two boatmen were subsequently captured. After interrogation, they confessed to the robbery. The county government, in addition to rigorously pursuing the escaped bandits, has handed over the suspects, stolen goods, and weapons to the garrison command for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Dismissal of Security Training Officers</h3>
<p>The Fifth District of Jiangsu Province Security Training Commissioner's Office and the squad leader training class have both been ordered to close simultaneously. It is understood that Training Officer Yan Ming has been transferred to the Provincial Security Department as a service member.</p>
<h3>Request to Establish a Public Health Experiment Zone</h3>
<p>The county government of this county believes that Yangzhou City has a high concentration of smokers, and the urban area is exceptionally vast, with a population reaching 120,000. All aspects of healthcare and epidemic prevention require significant funding, which the economic resources of a single county cannot possibly fully support. Moreover, Yangzhou City is separated from the provincial capital by only a narrow strip of water, and is close to Jingkou (Zhenjiang), with officials frequently traveling between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. Public health is undoubtedly a matter of public image. Recognizing this, the county government recently submitted a request to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs for approval to follow the precedents of the public health experiment zones in Huaiyin and Jianbi Town in Zhenjiang, and establish a public health experiment zone in the urban area of this county.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Security Team Conscription Training</h3>
<p>The security teams of various counties in the Nantong region have gradually disbanded their hired recruits and replaced them with conscripts, with considerable success. As the period for this year's discharge of veterans approaches, the county government has dispatched Section Chief Wang Youwen and others to various districts to instruct the conscription of strong young men in preparation for forming teams to replace them. Peng Longxiang, Deputy Commander of the District Security Command, is also inspecting the rural areas.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Bandits Through Clean-Up Campaign</h3>
<p>During this clean-up campaign in Nantong, the military police arrested male and female bandits, all of whom were sent to the District Security Command. Due to the large number of people, the military judge conducted trials. Those with serious offenses were detained pending punishment, while over twenty ordinary thieves were transferred to the court.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Bicycle Registration Implemented</h3>
<p>The county government, noting that the roads in the city and suburbs of this county have all been repaired and are smooth, and that the number of bicycles has increased sharply, with frequent reports of unskilled riders injuring pedestrians, has therefore implemented registration and licensing in accordance with the bicycle management regulations of the Construction Department to facilitate management. It has been decided that before 12:00 noon on the 21st of this month, owners of bicycle shops and private bicycle owners should obtain registration forms from the Construction Section of the county government (i.e., the Third Section). Before 12:00 noon on the 23rd, they should bring their bicycles to the front of the county government auditorium to await inspection. Those who pass will be issued magnetic license plates (at 2 jiao each) and assigned numbers. They should then pay the donation fee to the local donation collection office at any time. The fee is one yuan per quarter for commercial bicycles and five jiao for private bicycles. It is reported that there are approximately 200 bicycles in this county.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Smuggled Goods Discovered in Cloth Factory</h3>
<p>The Jiahe Cloth Factory in Jiaxing has been in operation for over twenty years and has had some success in the past. Recently, wealthy merchants such as Bao Jiezhi have taken over its operation. They have reduced wages, and a strike occurred last month. It was only after the party and government made strenuous efforts to mediate that work was resumed. However, it was discovered that the factory had imported a large quantity of smuggled goods the other day. Someone secretly reported this to the county government and provided detailed drawings. The county government immediately ordered the head of the detective team, Shen Jianfei, detective Li Zhankui, and other detectives to search the factory on the afternoon of the 18th, based on the drawings. They discovered twenty-two boxes of bleaching powder and over one thousand packages of "Laifeng" brand Japanese yarn. The discovered items were reported to County Magistrate Wang and sealed pending further investigation. However, according to Zhou Yuqing, the manager of the factory, the bleaching powder was purchased from the Yuanyuhe Color Material Shop in Shanghai at a price of 3 yuan 6 jiao per box and was delivered by the Tiansheng Transportation Company on Tangwan Street on the 14th. The Japanese yarn was shipped from a cloth factory in Shanghai to be woven into cloth and was not smuggled goods. However, the public is paying close attention to this matter. As the county's anti-smuggling association is being established, the discovery of this situation will be severely punished as an example to others.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Subsidy for Tea Industry Improvement</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, in order to improve Pingshui green tea, has established the Pingshui Tea Industry Improvement Field. The operating expenses of 28,000 yuan will be subsidized by half by the National Economic Council's Agricultural Department. Recently, the department was merged into the Ministry of Industry, but the subsidy of 14,000 yuan will still be allocated by the Economic Council. In addition, the Ministry of Industry will allocate a guidance fee of 8,000 yuan for technical improvement. The Field is scheduled to be established in early August, with Wu Juenong internally designated as the director.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Oil Material Factory</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry is planning to establish a vegetable oil material factory, and Zhejiang Province has decided to invest 300,000 yuan. 150,000 yuan will be allocated by the Finance Department in the form of newly issued government bonds as official shares, and the remaining 150,000 yuan will be raised from commercial shares. Finance Minister Cheng Yuanfan will go to Shanghai in the next few days to encourage tung oil merchants to invest, in order to raise the funds as soon as possible and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The establishment meeting of the factory is scheduled to be held soon. Construction Minister Wu Tingyang went to Beijing for this reason and will return to Hangzhou soon.</p>
<h3>Preparation for Literature Exhibition</h3>
<p>In order to promote provincial culture and improve academic atmosphere, the Zhejiang Department of Education has decided to hold a Zhejiang Literature Exhibition during the Double Tenth Festival this year. The Provincial Library is responsible for organizing the exhibition, drafting various regulations, and organizing a working committee. Zhang Pengnian, the third section chief of the Department of Education, and Chen Xunci, the director of the Provincial Library, will serve as the director and deputy director, respectively. The General Library on Daxue Road will be the venue. Scholars who are enthusiastic about culture and education, and famous collectors from both inside and outside the province, will be hired as design committee members. Wang Fuchuan, Yu Yueyuan, Qian Junfu, Sun Licai, and Shao Peizi have been designated as standing committee members. After discussions, Sun Churen and Xiang Lansheng have been hired as the director and deputy director of the book group, Yuan Siyong and Gao Yehou as the director and deputy director of the calligraphy and painting group, Zou Jingshu and Ye Pinsan as the director and deputy director of the ancient artifact group, Chen Boheng and Gu Dingmei as the director and deputy director of the bronze and stone rubbing group, Wang Fuchuan and Li Chukuang as the director of the revolutionary literature group, and Lin Fengmian and Chen Wanli as the director of the picture group. In accordance with the branch rules, the administrative inspectors of each district will serve as the directors, and local famous scholars will serve as the deputy directors. Branch offices for collecting items will also be established in Nanjing and Shanghai, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Wrongful Killing of Refugee Case in Quan Gong</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Afu, a member of the Quan Gong Pavilion militia, mistakenly killing a refugee from Hubei, it is reported that the county government originally scheduled an autopsy on the 16th to examine the bullet casing. However, because the case requires forensic examination, a request has been submitted to the High Court to send officials to Pinghu to preside over the investigation. Meanwhile, the request of the parties concerned to temporarily postpone the autopsy has been approved.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Last Year's Salt Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>Bengbu is the distribution center for Huai salt, and the salt supply comes from Banpu and other fields in northern Anhui. It is transported by truck, sea, and river. The city is a hub for truck, sea, and river transportation, so there are many salt warehouses, making it a large salt market. The salt consumption areas of 19 counties in northern Anhui and 14 counties in eastern Henan are distributed and sold from here. In recent years, salt has also been directly transported to Guzhen and Mingguang, and sold together with Bengbu salt. For truck and sea salt transported to Guzhen and Mingguang, a local market tax of 4 yuan per dan, a military tax and sales tax of 2 yuan, and a building tax of 1 jiao are collected on the spot. For salt transported to Bengbu, a market carrying fee is collected first, and then officials from the tax collection office collect the military and sales tax of 2 yuan at the salt warehouse when the salt is unloaded. The military and sales tax for river salt is collected at Xiba. Since Bengbu is the only major salt market on the Anhui-Henan border, the Huai River Salt Affairs Supervisory Office has established a tax collection office here to collect the military and sales tax on northern salt. In the twenty-fourth fiscal year, from July of last year to June of this year, a total of 1,388,313 dan of salt were transported by truck, sea, and river. The tax collection office collected a total of 2,352,261 yuan in salt tax. Recently, newly taxed salt transported by merchants has been loaded onto ships for sale. It is expected that the salt tax revenue for the twenty-fifth fiscal year will increase compared to the previous year.</p>

<h3>European and Asian Giant Aircraft Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sino-German Aviation Achieves Fourth Success: Chinese and Foreign Guests Attend Welcome Ceremony Enthusiastically; German Community in Shanghai Holds Grand Tea Party to Welcome; Another Aircraft Continues Flight to China and Expected to Arrive in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>The Junkers Ju 52 tri-motor giant aircraft, leased by Eurasia Aviation Corporation from Germany for the fourth time, was flown from Berlin to China by famous German aviator Lutz and others. It arrived in Shanghai at 1:15 PM yesterday and landed at Longhua Airport. This is the fourth successful direct flight between China and Germany. Therefore, yesterday, over a hundred Chinese and foreign guests attended the welcome ceremony. The German community also held a grand tea party to welcome the aircraft, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Airport Arrangement</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the company that the aircraft had arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, the company sent letters to various circles in China and abroad, inviting them to send representatives to participate in the welcome ceremony. At the same time, they sent representatives to Longhua Airport to arrange everything. The welcome ceremony venue was set up in the company's newly completed hangar. The national flags of China and Germany and the Eurasia Company flag were hung from the roof. In addition to the giant aircraft and a small fast aircraft parked in the hangar, several large dining tables were placed in front of the giant aircraft, surrounded by chairs. Fresh flowers and champagne were provided on the tables, as well as tea, snacks, and cold drinks to entertain the guests. The arrangement was simple and neat.</p>
<p>Welcome Guests</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and many guests attended the welcome ceremony. In addition to the company's general manager, Li Jingcong, who was unable to attend due to business in Beijing, those who attended included Walther, the representative of Lufthansa in China; Nolimo, the director of the Eastern Department of the German National Socialist Party; Stass, the representative of the Junkers Aircraft Factory in Shanghai; Weitman, the president of the German General Association; He En, the head of the aviation group of Eurasia Company; Miao Guanxuan, the director of the operations group; officials from the German Consulate; and over a hundred Chinese and German male and female guests. They were warmly received by Miao Guanxuan, Ling Yizhi, Wang Yanyun, and Cai Zhiren of the company.</p>
<p>Landing Situation</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, Chinese and foreign guests arrived at the airport one after another. They were accompanied by company staff to visit the new hangar. At 1:15 PM, the giant aircraft was spotted in the eastern sky. One minute later, it reached the sky above the airport. The sound of the engines rumbled, shaking the entire airport. The welcomers applauded or took off their hats to express their welcome. The aircraft circled once in the sky, then flew to the Bund area and circled once before returning to the airport at 1:30 PM and landing safely in front of the large hangar. The aircraft's body was silver-gray and was a Junkers Ju 52. The fuselage was marked "D-Amar," and the tail was painted with the red swastika emblem of the German National Socialist Party. All speed, safety equipment, and seating were identical to the previous three aircraft.</p>
<p>Flower Presentation Welcome</p>
<p>After the aircraft landed, He En, the head of the aviation group, Miao Guanxuan, the director of the operations group, and Chinese and foreign guests crowded forward, surrounding the aircraft. Shortly after, the door opened, and the chief pilot, Lutz, the co-pilot, La'aiting, and the radio operator, Qiao Aide, all smiled and disembarked amid cheers. Except for Lutz, who was wearing a yellow flight suit, the rest were wearing white aviation suits. Miss Ye Shulian presented flowers to each of them separately, and they took a group photo with the welcoming guests next to the aircraft. They then went to the hangar to drink champagne together. Miao Guanxuan delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Li Jingcong, saying, "General Manager Li Jingcong is in Beijing on business, so I am representing Eurasia Company to express our welcome to everyone. Lufthansa has leased three giant aircraft, and this is the fourth one. We are very grateful for this spirit of cooperation. This spirit is sufficient to enhance Sino-German relations. We hope to achieve the goal of Sino-German air transportation based on this spirit and develop air traffic between China and Germany. I offer champagne to wish you all good health." After the speech, tea and snacks were served, and the event dispersed at around 2:00 PM. The pilots then went to the Broadway Mansion on the Waibaidu Bridge to rest.</p>
<p>Flight Details</p>
<p>After the aircraft arrived in Shanghai, Eurasia Company held a tea party at the German General Association at 454 Haige Road at 5:30 PM yesterday to entertain pilot Lutz and other members of the Chinese and German press. Pilot Lutz, La'aiting, Mrs. Lutz, and reporters from German newspapers, the Continental Daily, and Chinese newspapers attended. They were warmly received by Walder, the head of the aviation group of the company, and Secretary Ling Yizhi. During the party, pilot Lutz spoke to the Chinese and foreign reporters about his flight from Germany to China. When his vacation expired last December and he was preparing to come to China, he received a telegram from the Eurasia authorities requesting him to lease a giant aircraft and drive it. Although he had already purchased a boat ticket for the trip, he cancelled the passage and was pleased to accept the piloting duty. His goal was to complete this international long-distance flight mission. (Note: Lutz had previously flown a small single-engine aircraft from Germany to China via Dihua three years ago, so he has experience in long-distance flights.) After receiving the telegram in early June, he inspected the aircraft's components and test-flew it in Germany. He was very satisfied with it and began preparing to come to China. On the morning of July 5, at 6:30 AM, he piloted the aircraft and took off from Berlin's largest airport, Tempeihof. On the first day, he landed in Belgrade to refuel. That day, he flew to Rhodos, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, and spent the night there. When he was about to take off on the second day, there was a heavy rainstorm. After the rain stopped, the two mechanics who were traveling with him climbed onto the left and right wings to check the aircraft's components. Unfortunately, one of the mechanics slipped and fell to the ground. He was rushed to an Italian doctor for treatment, who diagnosed a serious injury with a broken leg bone. Lutz then flew the injured mechanic back to Athens, the capital of Greece, and sent him to a hospital for treatment. He also sent a telegram to Lufthansa in Berlin to report the incident and requested them to send another mechanic to replace him. He introduced Qiao Aide, who had worked in China for many years, as a mechanic because he was familiar with the Sino-German route and was capable of handling everything. Therefore, he went to Berlin to wait for Qiao to arrive in Athens, which delayed the journey for several days. Qiao finally arrived in Athens on July 13. On the morning of the 14th, he departed from Athens. He originally did not intend to go to Rhodos again, but had to land there to return the stretcher that carried the injured mechanic. After taking off from the island, he stopped in Aleppo to refuel, and then flew to Baghdad. On the 15th, he refueled in Buschir and flew to Jask in Persia, where he stayed for one day before flying directly to Karachi in India. The next day (the 16th), he departed from there and refueled in Johdpur and Alshadad. That night, he arrived in Caluta and spent the night. On the morning of the 17th, he departed from Caluta, refueled in Yangon, and then flew to Bangkok in Siam. On the 18th, he flew to Hanoi in Annam and then to Hong Kong. On the morning of the 19th (yesterday), at 7:30 AM, he took off from Hong Kong and finally flew to Shanghai Longhua Airport at 1:15 PM, completing this long-distance flight. He was very pleased. The actual total time of this trip was 57 hours of flight in the air, and 4 hours of delay due to the accident in Athens. The weather was good along the way from Germany to China, and the aircraft's components were fortunately not damaged. The flight was smooth. At each stop, the local Chinese and German people and consuls came to the station to take care of him and welcome him, for which he was deeply grateful. According to his original plan, he had planned to fly directly to Kunming, Yunnan, without going through Hong Kong, but because the Kunming airport was not good, he received a telegram from the Eurasia authorities on Friday instructing him to change his route and go through Hong Kong. When he departed from Hong Kong to fly to Shanghai, the weather was extremely bad, with heavy rain that obscured his direction. After careful driving, he circled low over the sea in Hong Kong several times before daring to fly directly to Shanghai in the right direction, which was a great fortune in misfortune, he said. After Lutz finished his report, Eurasia colleagues hosted a banquet for Lutz at the German General Association at 9:00 PM, where they raised their glasses and enjoyed themselves until they dispersed.</p>
<p>Joining the Route</p>
<p>According to the head of the company's aviation group, after the giant aircraft is left in Shanghai to be inspected and repaired, it will soon join the Shaanxi-Yunnan route for flight. In the future, it is planned to be deployed on the Lanzhou-Baotou route, because at present, there is only one small single-engine aircraft on the Lanzhou-Baotou route, and it is quite necessary to add a giant three-engine aircraft.</p>
<p>Another Aircraft Arrives Soon</p>
<p>According to the company's spokesperson, the company has leased two giant aircraft from Lufthansa this time. In addition to the one that arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the other one has already taken off from Berlin to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. The aircraft will be assigned to various routes for application. The pilots who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, except for Lutz, who was originally employed by the company, the co-pilot, La'aiting, and the radio operator, Gao Aide, do not plan to return to Germany and will work at Eurasia Company.</p>
<h3>Factory Federation: Preventing Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Six Articles in Letter to Members</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, recognizing that the dumping of smuggled goods endangers the foundation of the country, has issued a notice to all manufacturer members nationwide, warning them of six things, urging them to report smuggled goods, and improve manufacturing. The notice is recorded below. For the matter of notice, at this time of strong neighbor's aggression, political and economic oppression are increasing day by day. If we do not try to remedy the situation immediately, the foundation of the country will be destroyed, and it will be difficult to survive. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have been alarmed and horrified by the strong neighbor's military occupation, and all have lamented the loss of sovereignty and the increasing loss of land. In fact, what we should be alarmed and vigilant about is not limited to this. Looking around the country, although it has not yet been completely controlled by the enemy, the impact of international trade dumping and the recent serious smuggling have caused unprecedented attacks on our national industry and commerce, and the national economy is even in danger of bankruptcy. Therefore, the whole country holds the belief of self-reliance and strives to resist smuggled goods closely. Our member manufacturers, taking the promotion of national goods and the recovery of rights and interests as their duty, should uphold the creed of saving the country with national goods and serve the society and the country at this serious juncture. Therefore, the following six items are prescribed, and it is hoped that our member manufacturers will jointly abide by them: (1) The raw materials for manufactured products should be based on the principle of using domestic products; (2) If there are no domestic products that can be purchased for the raw material paper, then it must be determined whether there is a customs tariff when importing the goods; (3) Manufacturers should supervise each other and unanimously refuse to use smuggled goods; (4) If there are any purchases of smuggled goods or other illegal acts, they may be reported to this association secretly, and the competent authorities will be requested to punish them; (5) Industry infighting should be avoided, and business ethics should be respected. They must not raise prices to create opportunities for foreign goods, nor can they devalue prices too much to destroy the same industry; (6) Manufacturing technology should be improved, so that consumers are happy to purchase them. The above six items are both to save the country and to save themselves. It is hoped that our member manufacturers will understand this meaning together and abide by it consistently. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>President Sun Talks About Post-War Issues in Guangdong: Central Government Assists in Reorganizing Finance; Troops Handed Over to Yu Hanmou; Provincial Administration Headed by Lin Yungai; Whether Xiao Focheng Will Go North Undecided</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, recently came to Shanghai from Beijing to take care of personal matters. He will stay in Shanghai for a few more days and then go to Lushan to escape the summer heat. President Sun had previously telegraphed Xiao Focheng, welcoming him to come north. There is no reply yet, and it is understood that whether Xiao will come north is currently undecided and will depend on Deng Qingyang and others' reporting after they arrive in Hong Kong. According to President Sun, since Chen Jitang left office, the Guangdong army has completely submitted to the Central Government, and the Guangdong situation has been resolved. Regarding the post-war issues in Guangdong, the Central Government will naturally assist the local authorities in reorganizing finance. This is the most important issue in the aftermath. Regarding the troops, Director Yu Hanmou will be responsible for the reorganization. Regarding the administration, the Central Government has already appointed Lin Yungai as the chairman of Guangdong Province, and Lin will be in charge of everything. Lin will return to Guangdong to preside over provincial affairs as soon as Yu Hanmou arrives in the province. As for the Guangxi army, they are currently withdrawing from Guangdong Province. Whether Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi are aware of their mistakes is currently uncertain. If Li and Bai can clearly express their obedience to the Central Government, the situation can be clarified.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Goods Gradually Disappearing in This City</h3>
<p>Authorities Strictly Suppressing; Southern Smuggling Not Easy; Smuggling Merchants Suffering Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Shen Shi News reports that since the Ministry of Finance ordered strict suppression of smuggling in North China, and established anti-smuggling investigation offices along the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, and allocated customs officers to inspect sections, although smuggling of goods to the south has not stopped, it is gradually coming to an end. A reporter recently learned from business circles that smuggled goods from North China have been rarely seen in Shanghai recently. Because smuggling merchants imported a large number of goods by sea and land last year and hoarded them, the crackdown is now strict, sales are stagnant, and the supply has already exceeded the demand. Although artificial silk, white sugar, and cigarette paper have been imported in the past, merchants are mostly unwilling to purchase these goods, so their sales are very small. Smuggling merchants have suffered heavy losses and have been unable to support themselves. At the same time, the smuggling situation in North China is also gradually becoming unsustainable. Smuggling rogues are greedy for profit. Since they have been affected by the strict investigation and seizure by the authorities, their organization has become scattered. It is recently heard that most of the smuggled goods to the south are transported by sea, but they cannot be sold in Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places, so they are trying to transport them to Shaanxi and other places at reduced prices for sale. It is not easy to come south to Nanjing and Shanghai. Therefore, smuggled goods in Shanghai are gradually disappearing. It is expected that after the organization of the anti-smuggling investigation office along the Beijing-Shenyang Railway by the General Office of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Investigation Bureau is established, and the smuggled goods from eastern Hebei are intercepted, smuggling in North China can be eliminated soon.</p>
<h3>Local Cantonese Organizations Hope to Revitalize Guangdong Politics</h3>
<p>Powerful Cantonese organizations in Shanghai, such as the Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association, GuangZhao Public Hall, Chaozhou Guildhall, Chaozhou Fellow-Provincials Association, Jiaying Five Districts Fellow-Provincials Association, Huizhou Fellow-Provincials Association, Zhongshan Fellow-Provincials Association, Panyu Township Hall, Wuhua Fellow-Provincials Association, Dabu Fellow-Provincials Association, and dozens of other organizations, repeatedly telegraphed Chen Jitang regarding his recent actions, urging him to prioritize national salvation, regional salvation, and the salvation of the people, to obey the central government, to concentrate national strength to cope with the extraordinary crisis, and reminding him that Guangdong is the source of the revolution, where revolutionary ideas are most fervent, and that he must not act impulsively, undermine national unity, provoke civil war, or devastate the region. Now, fortunately, Chen Jitang recognizes the futility of his position and has resolved to retire, departing Guangdong for Hong Kong. This news has brought great joy to the entire nation. The Cantonese people in Shanghai deeply feel this is fortunate for Guangdong province and a blessing for the nation, and they are all jubilant and encouraged. However, although Chen Jitang has left, some of his corrupt subordinates have not yet left the province. The community believes this remains a hidden danger for Guangdong province and a crucial issue to address in cleaning up the mess. It is said that various organizations will separately telegraph the central government and Director Yu Hanmou, urging a thorough reform and the prompt appointment of a highly respected, capable, and well-rounded official, adept both domestically and internationally, to govern Guangdong province, so that the province can recover its vitality, strengthen its power, and consolidate the nation's foundation.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Situation is About to be Resolved; Shanghai-Guangdong Commerce is Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Freight Volume Increasing Compared to Before</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong commerce had been stagnant for over a month. Now, with the situation in Guangdong province showing hope for a swift resolution, Guangbang merchants in Shanghai are actively procuring textiles, grains, and other goods for shipment to Guangdong to meet the demand. Simultaneously, Guangdong sugar is flowing into Shanghai. Bank remittances have increased compared to before. Therefore, once the situation stabilizes, Shanghai-Guangdong commerce can quickly return to its original state.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Inspection Measures for Domestic Artificial Silk and Textile Products; Customs Sets Deadlines for Factories to Report and Verify Purchases of Artificial Silk, and to Obtain Customs Tax Receipts</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Finance, to prevent the smuggling of imported artificial silk and artificial silk textiles, had previously included them in the inspection list. However, domestic factories also produce artificial silk textiles, which had not been subject to inspection. Now, to prevent exploitation by unscrupulous merchants and avoid undermining the effectiveness of preventing the smuggling of artificial silk imports, it has stipulated nine inspection and inventory procedures for factories purchasing artificial silk and producing domestic textiles made of or mixed with artificial silk. These are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Customs Declaration, Inventory, and Issuance of Transportation and Sales Permits</p>
<p>(1) All domestic textiles made of or mixed with artificial silk by factories should be inspected in accordance with the provisional regulations for imported goods. Factories transporting and selling the aforementioned textiles without permits should be handled according to Article 8 of the provisional regulations for the inspection of imported goods. (2) Customs will set a deadline for factories to inventory their existing stock. (3) Factories should report the quantity of their existing stock to customs within the deadline set by customs, attaching a certificate from the relevant trade association. Customs will dispatch personnel to the factories for verification and registration. (4) Registered existing textile stocks will be exempted from tax certificates and issued transportation and sales permits. (5) For all registered existing artificial silk stocks, factories should provide proof of tax payment. If no proof of tax payment is available, customs will set a deadline for factories to request a tax payment certificate from the original importing customs and submit it for verification. Customs may temporarily seal the relevant stock of artificial silk. If the customs proof of tax payment is not submitted for verification after the deadline, the relevant factories should immediately pay the supplementary tax according to the import tariff, and will be exempt from penalties or confiscation.</p>
<p>Purchase of Raw Materials Must Include Tax Receipts</p>
<p>(6) All factories purchasing artificial silk raw materials should obtain evidence of paid import taxes from the artificial silk merchants selling the goods, provided by customs, and keep it for verification. Customs will issue transportation and sales permits for the artificial silk textiles reported by the factories based on the artificial silk tax payment evidence. (7) All factories purchasing artificial silk and selling artificial silk textiles should record detailed information in ledgers according to the provisional regulations for the inspection of goods transportation and sales and submit a monthly list, certified by the relevant trade association, to the nearby customs for inspection at any time. (8) All textiles mixed with artificial silk should be handled in accordance with these measures. (9) In areas with a large number of factories, customs will conduct the inventory. In other areas with fewer factories and far from customs, the relevant trade association (or the chamber of commerce if there is no trade association) will conduct the initial inventory and report the quantity of existing stock to the nearby customs, which will then dispatch personnel to verify and inventory. The above measures, when conducted by customs, must be handled by the tax commissioner and the customs superintendent in consultation with the trade association or chamber of commerce.</p>
<h3>Taxes and Levies Similar to Income Tax</h3>
<p>Must Be Abolished Universally to Avoid Public Concerns</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance's planned income tax is about to be levied. Various trade associations believe several clauses are of great importance to the national economy, the people's livelihood, and the future of industry, and have specifically submitted opinions to the central government for modification. Xin Xin News Agency reporters specifically interviewed economic experts and leading merchants to solicit their opinions. They all expressed support for the government's imposition of income tax, citing that income tax has been implemented in Europe and the United States for a long time and is regarded as a major national tax. The state's tax revenue should be direct, which can eliminate corruption and not harm the people. Currently, the major national taxes in our country, such as customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes, are not direct in nature. Not only is the burden on the people uneven, but the state's revenue is also inconvenient. Furthermore, the state budget is greatly related to direct and indirect tax revenue. Therefore, for the sake of strengthening the state's finances, for the people to fulfill their obligations, and for the sake of equitable tax burden, income tax is a good tax that benefits the national economy, the people's livelihood, and the development of industry, and it is essential to implement it quickly. In the past, our country's taxes were very complex. As a result of the efforts of the financial authorities to rectify them over the years, the types of arbitrary taxes and levies abolished are not few. However, in order to eliminate public concerns and the perception of double taxation, before the income tax is levied, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the taxes in each province and city. If there are taxes and levies of the same nature, they must be abolished universally. Then the implementation of the income tax will certainly be very smooth.</p>
<h3>After Guangdong's Renovation of the Silver Dollar System Was Shelved, Tang Hai'an Has Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, the central government, in order to unify the currency system, sent Tang Hai'an, senior advisor to the Ministry of Finance and superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, south again to inquire about everything in detail. However, because the issue of transferring silver from Guangdong province to central government custody was difficult to implement, Tang's trip yielded no results. It is now learned that Tang returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Lincoln two days ago. It is also learned that Tang will report on his trip south to Finance Minister Kong and then resume his duties. As for Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications and Bei Zuyi, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, they have also decided to suspend their trip south.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Nearly 10 Million Yuan in New Subsidiary Currency; Still Not Circulating in Remote Provinces and Being Promoted; One-Yuan and Half-Yuan New Coins Also Being Minted</h3>
<p>Since implementing the legal tender policy, the Ministry of Finance has also sought to adjust the financial system and unify the subsidiary currency. Therefore, it specifically ordered the Central Mint to mint new subsidiary currency, including several types of coins: 20-cent, 10-cent, 5-cent, 1-cent, and half-cent nickel coins. Because they are convenient to carry and easy to calculate, people are happy to use them. Therefore, demand on the market has increased sharply, and the Central Mint is continuing to work overtime to mint them. During the summer of this year, the factory originally had a summer break, but due to the minting of the new subsidiary currency, it worked as usual. According to a Dagong News Agency reporter's inquiry to financial authorities, more than 9 million of this new currency has been minted to date, approaching 10 million yuan, and all of it has been circulated on the market. However, local authorities in various provinces need this new subsidiary currency urgently to adjust the financial market and have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to ship it for use. Therefore, the new currency is in short supply. It is used extensively in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It is not yet widespread in remote provinces due to insufficient distribution and is currently being vigorously promoted. As for the one-yuan coins and half-yuan subsidiary currency recently decided to be minted by the Ministry of Finance, their models have also been cast overseas and shipped to Shanghai. They are slightly larger but similar in style to the new currency. They are also about to be minted.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses the Resolution of the Guangdong Situation</h3>
<p>Wang's Return Home is Still Undetermined</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Committee member Chu Minyi arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by night train that evening. He said that the Guangdong situation has been resolved since Chen Jitang left the province. However, the only concern at present is the potential conflict between the Guangdong and Guangxi armies. Chairman Wang is still recuperating at a spa in Czechoslovakia. Because he has not yet recovered, his return home is still undetermined. I myself will return to Nanjing tonight (the 19th) to handle matters related to the general election office for the National Assembly representatives.</p>
<h3>Savings Banks Invest in Rural Agriculture</h3>
<p>Allocating One-Fifth of Total Deposits</p>
<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Savings Bank Law, it has been stipulated that the amount of collateralized loans to rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products by each bank shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposit amount. Although each bank has already expanded rural lending as much as possible, such as organizing the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate to handle rural lending, the total amount of loans is still less than one-fifth of the total savings deposits. Therefore, each bank has decided to allocate one-fifth of the total savings deposits as joint funding for the Agricultural Foundation Bureau to comply with the Savings Bank Law.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jingzhou Discusses Financial Difficulties in Gansu Province; Will Go to Nanjing to Resign Within Days</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, Zhu Jingzhou, director of the Finance Department of Gansu Province, has taken leave to come to Suzhou to assist with the funeral arrangements for his father-in-law, Mr. Zhang Taiyan. On the 18th, he accompanied Zhang's son, Dao, from Suzhou to Shanghai to attend the memorial service for Mr. Zhang in the city and, on behalf of Mrs. Zhang, expressed gratitude to all parties for their condolences. A Dagong News Agency reporter interviewed Zhu, who said that Gansu province is barren and the people are poor, and coupled with banditry, financial difficulties have been felt particularly acutely in recent years. My own talents are insufficient, and I have repeatedly telegraphed the central government to request my resignation, but it has not yet been approved. I have decided to go to Nanjing within days to meet with the Executive Yuan in person and separately meet with Zhang Ji, Ding Weifen, and others to discuss the arrangements for Mr. Zhang's state funeral. After that, I will return to Gansu for a trip to prepare for the handover of the department's affairs.</p>
<h3>Tang Shaoyi Will Go to Lushan for Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>Trip to Qingdao Called Off</p>
<p>It is recently learned that Central Committee member Tang Shaoyi will instead go to Lushan for a summer retreat and that the trip to Qingdao has been called off. However, the date of departure has not yet been determined. He is still staying at the Broadway Mansions Hotel on the Bund and has not yet moved to a residence in the city center. Yesterday morning around nine o'clock, he drove out to visit friends.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Still Stays in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Moved to Private Residence for Quiet Recuperation from Nasal Ailment; Trip to Moganshan is Misreported</p>
<p>It was reported that Dr. Wang Chonghui, member of the Central Committee, had returned to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago and had gone to Moganshan for a summer retreat. It is now learned that this news is actually a misreport. Wang moved from Wei Daoming's residence on Haig Road back to his private residence on Massenet Road for quiet recuperation to recover from his nasal ailment as soon as possible. That place was originally his own private residence and was previously rented to Qi Yunqing, manager of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. He recently took it back for his own use.</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador is Scheduled to Arrive in China</h3>
<p>Around Mid-September</p>
<p>The newly appointed British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, has now scheduled to depart from England on the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Canada on the 4th of next month, accompanied by his wife, son, staff, and others, to take up his new post in China. According to diplomatic sources here, Hugessen will disembark in Japan for a few days' stay, taking the opportunity to visit the political and social circles there. The date of his arrival in China is scheduled for mid-September. Hugessen is currently 51 years old, with one son and two daughters. He studied at Oxford University and entered the diplomatic service in 1908. In 1919, he served on the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and was soon promoted to the rank of First Secretary. From 1926 to 1930, he served as Counselor at the British Embassy in Belgium. From 1930 to 1934, he served as Minister to various countries in the Balkan Peninsula. Subsequently, he was transferred to the post of Minister to Iran. After the former Ambassador to China, Sir J. T. T. Babington, was transferred to the post of Permanent Under-Secretary, Hugessen was promoted to the post of Ambassador to China. Hugessen had previously visited China once and has always paid close attention to the situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Shanghai Slum Representatives</h3>
<p>Organizing a Slum United Association to Petition Various Parties on a Regular Basis</p>
<p>The slum dwellers in the two districts of Pudong and Puxi in the city, in order to seek effective communication and self-help, held a joint meeting of Pudong and Puxi slum representatives at Bing Society at 4 pm yesterday. It was decided to organize a slum united association, elect 29 preparatory committee members to be responsible for the preparations, and scheduled to petition various parties for relief on the 21st. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>The attendees yesterday included Chen Jiufeng, representative of the First Special District Citizens' Association; Tang Anping, Xu Xiguang, Sun Hankui, Guo Bingzhi, Chen Yongde, Zhang Ziying, Huang Maoxiang, Ye Shuting, Yao Shanfu, Chen Jingqing, Huang Zhizhong, representatives of the slums on Lan Road, Yanshan Road, and Chaoyang Road in Pudong District; Hu Yumen, Xu Yiqun, Sun Dongchen, Sun Weijin, Xu Xipeng, Liu Jinshan, Tian Rui, Gu Tiansheng, Yin Qingyu, Yin Youde, Jiang Yibo, Zhu Wenxue, Liu Guangchun, Li Jiaxuan, representatives of the slums on Seymour Road, Xiaoshadu Road, Tokyo Road, Yichang Road, and Mabailu Road in Puxi District; and more than 50 other people. Chen Jiufeng was elected chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, the chairman first reported that the Municipal Council recently planned to order the slums in the two districts of Pudong and Puxi to relocate immediately. Although a postponement of the demolition had been obtained as a result of discussions with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a director of the Municipal Council, a proper and thorough solution for the slums had still not been provided. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone present today will jointly address the issue. It is hoped that everyone will unite and fight together to ensure that the Municipal Council has a place to resettle the slums before they are allowed to relocate. Otherwise, it would be inhumane to simply pursue the beautiful name of tidying up the city and disregarding the displacement of the slums. This association cannot but be moved and take action. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will work together until the goal of self-help is achieved. Currently, a united association will first be formed by the slums in the two districts of Pudong and Puxi to decide on procedures and continue negotiations with the Municipal Council. My opinion is to: (1) expedite the construction of public housing so that the slums have a place to live; (2) increase labor remuneration and establish public factories; (3) leniently register rickshaw pullers; (4) the slums automatically organize a united association for systematic management; (5) limit the increase of slums; (6) automatically conduct household registration surveys; (7) implement baojia self-government, with every ten households as a group. These seven points are submitted to you today for discussion. It is hoped that everyone will express their opinions as much as possible in order to decide on the direction of action and achieve the goal of self-help.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>(1) The motion to organize a slum united association was resolved and passed unanimously without objection. (2) The motion to stipulate the number of preparatory committee members for the slum united association was resolved and 29 representatives from the two districts of Pudong and Puxi were elected as preparatory committee members to be responsible for the preparations. (3) The motion that the association should request relief from the Municipal Council, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and other parties was resolved. It was approved that on the 21st of this month, all the members of the association would separately petition the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the Citizens' Association, and the Municipal Council's He DeKui and others. (4) The motion to decide on the principles of the petition was resolved. A. Demand that the Municipal Council expedite the construction of public housing to avoid displacement of the slums. B. If the Municipal Council needs to properly build roads or the landowners formally build houses, relocation will be allowed. C. Slum representatives guarantee that the number of slums will not increase in the future. (5) The motion to investigate the number of slums and the population was resolved. It was decided that each representative would thoroughly investigate and report to the meeting for reference. (6) The motion to decide on the name of the association was resolved and named the Shanghai Slum United Association. (7) The motion that the slums are scattered in various districts, making contact difficult, and the association plans to establish branch offices in Pudong and Puxi separately to achieve effective communication was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>List of Preparatory Committee Members</p>
<p>Hu Yumen, Xu Yiqun, Tian Ruishan, Sun Weijin, Jiang Yibo, Wang Chengguang, Xu Xipeng, Liu Jinshan, Xu Jingqing, Deng Xiuzheng from Puxi slums; Wang Qitai, Sun Hongkui, Xu Xiyuan, Yin Yipu, Sun Xudan, Zhang Buyun, Yang Jinchen, Tang Anping, Gu Xuebo, Liu Xuezhuo, Wang Jiayu, Wang Daomeng, Guo Bingzhi, Jiang Shanchang, Ji Yunsheng, Jia Zilian, Zhang Ziying, Dong Maoxiang, Ye Shuting from Pudong slums; and 29 others.</p>
<h3>Municipal Audit Office Builds Its Own Building</h3>
<p>Selected Site in the City Center; Completion Scheduled for This Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit, because of handling the audit matters of the central and local agencies stationed in Shanghai, the work is increasing day by day. The current rented houses on Baoshan Road in Zhabei are narrow and insufficient for use. It has decided to build its own building. A site has been selected near the right side of the Municipal Government in the city center, covering an area of nine mu and four li. The site is public land and the office has obtained the consent of the Municipal Land Bureau to pay rent at the rate of one-thousandth of the land price per month. A contract has now been signed. In addition to the third engineering team of the office being responsible for designing the construction project, bidding will be invited soon for construction, which is scheduled to be completed within the year for relocation in the second half of the year. The construction cost is budgeted at 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Plan to Promote Mulberry Planting</h3>
<p>The two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have made many efforts to improve the silk industry in recent years. In addition to improving silkworm breeds and establishing a joint silk reeling company between the two provinces, they also plan to promote mulberry planting with all their strength. The persons in charge of the silk control committees of the two provinces once met in Shanghai to discuss the plan to promote mulberry planting. They plan to cultivate new mulberry trees to replace the withered ones and establish mulberry nurseries. As for the financial aspect, it is heard that Zhejiang Province will be responsible for two-thirds and Jiangsu Province will be responsible for one-third. It is also heard that the two provinces often feel a lack of silkworm eggs in recent years and have had to purchase them from Italy and Japan. A very large number of the Japanese silkworm eggs purchased this year had poor development and died midway. Therefore, the National Economic Commission and the silk control committees of the two provinces are trying their best to improve the self-sufficiency of silkworm eggs. According to the person in charge of the silk improvement committee of the National Economic Commission, domestic silkworm eggs can be self-sufficient from next year. As for the improvement of silkworm eggs, Dr. Mary is still responsible for the research.</p>
<h3>Authorities Will Further Relax Flour Price Limit</h3>
<p>The Shanghai flour market price was previously bought by a large number of powerful merchants in the market, which led to a sharp rise under its influence. Later, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to maintain people's livelihood and crack down on speculation, limited the flour price to 3 yuan and 5 cents for the near term and slightly higher for the far term. Although the flour market has recently been affected by the new wheat entering the market, people are panicked and insist on not releasing it. There has also been a major disaster in the United States this year, which will inevitably lead to a poor harvest, so the flour price is temporarily difficult to fall. The Social Affairs Bureau relaxed the price limit on the 18th, with an increase of 7 cents for both near term and far term. The market still hovered at the highest level on the day of the market opening the day before yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday and there was no market. According to a reporter's inquiry to the flour industry in the city, the flour market will rise rather than fall, and the authorities will further relax the price to bring the market back to normal. The Flour Exchange has already submitted a request to the authorities and is expected to be approved within days. As for the exchange, it has decided to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the 28th to discuss the issues of increasing capital by 250,000 yuan (from the current 750,000 to 1 million) and revising the business policy. It is expected that they will be realized at the shareholders' meeting.</p>
<h3>Chaos in the Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yarn Factories Sell Stored Cotton and Voluntarily Suspend or Reduce Production</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the prices in the cotton yarn market have soared recently due to manipulation by speculators, especially for marked cotton, resulting in an abnormal situation of expensive cotton and cheap yarn. The reason for the rise is ostensibly the rise in US cotton prices, but in reality, it is because speculators, aware that domestic yarn factories will lack a month's worth of raw materials when the old cotton runs out and the new cotton has not yet arrived, have bought in bulk in anticipation of making a fortune later, which has led to the increasingly rampant cotton price rise. However, according to a Shen Shi News Agency reporter's inquiry to the yarn factories, most yarn factories are finding it very difficult to maintain operations due to the expensive cotton and cheap yarn. It is also summer, and actual sales are sluggish. Therefore, recently, the factories have instead sold their stored cotton and voluntarily suspended or reduced production. On closer inspection, Shanghai has ample stored cotton. If the factories suspend or reduce production, there should be no shortage of cotton for use this year. Moreover, my country's cotton production will increase this year, which is certain. New cotton will be available in mid-July of the lunar calendar. Therefore, the recent rise in marked cotton is undoubtedly the result of manipulation by speculators.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Industry is Planning to Save Itself from Crisis</h3>
<p>Planning to Request the Authorities to Implement It Immediately After a Decision is Made at the Meeting</p>
<p>According to Industry News Agency, the authorities of various Chinese yarn factories in the city, in view of the impact of smuggling in North China, so that various yarn factories in that area have been greatly threatened, most of them are unable to maintain the status quo, and most of them have been forced to suspend production or sell to Japanese merchants for operation. It is now heard that Japanese yarn merchants are further planning to move into Central China, and plan to implement a unified increase in production and spindles in each factory of Japanese merchants in Shanghai this fall to dump their products as much as possible, in order to cause Chinese yarn factories to be in desperate situation. The authorities of each factory were extremely shocked when they heard about this. They are now cooperating to devise a strong countermeasure to fight for the final survival. The Industry News Agency reporter recently learned reliable information from the yarn industry that the major figures of Chinese yarn factories have been actively exchanging opinions recently, planning to convene an important meeting of the National Chinese Yarn Factory Federation after the appropriate methods have been discussed in private, to discuss the opinions prepared by various parties. After the discussion results and a formal decision on the methods are made, personnel will be sent to Nanjing to request the various central authorities to allow implementation.</p>
<h3>Anti-Smuggling Association Decides to Send Representatives to Visit Kong</h3>
<p>Report on the Organization Process and Request Instructions on the Work Policy</p>
<p>The various public groups in the city, in order to assist the government in detecting smuggling, so that the government and the people cooperate, in order to achieve the purpose of curbing smuggled goods, established the Anti-Smuggling Association of All Circles in the middle of last month. All work is being actively planned and carried out, and a timetable has been set for the start of the method. In order to make the authorities understand the process of the association's organization and request instructions on the work policy to be handled in the future, it has specially appointed five representatives, including Yu Qiaqing, to go to the Central Bank at 11 am today to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to report and request instructions on the work policy, so that they can follow it.</p>
<h3>Yu Jianxun Scheduled to Go Abroad for Inspection</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to understand the latest improvements in the textile and rayon industries in various countries, for the purpose of learning from them, specially appointed Yu Jianxun, a member of the ministry, to go to Germany to examine everything. After receiving the order, Yu immediately prepared the procedures for going abroad and came to Shanghai to wait for the ship to go abroad. It is recently learned that Yu has scheduled to board the German postal ship Potsdam, which will set sail on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Recent Status of the Surveying Work of the Yangtze River Channel</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River channel from the north mouth to the Haizhou section is being surveyed by the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department. The silt and reefs in this section of the channel are densely packed, and the shipping industry is afraid of it. The central and local authorities, in view of this, believe that the surveying of this section of the channel is necessary to develop the coastal area of this section. The Hydrographic Office specifically sent technical personnel to survey in sections, which has been going on for more than a year. Because the area is sparsely populated, the work is very difficult. It is estimated that it will take three years to complete all the work. At present, the coastline survey has been extended north to Rugao. After two months, it can advance to Haizhou. After the coastline survey is completed, the second step is to survey the waterway. At that time, surveying ships will be sent to carry out the survey in sections, and a refined blueprint will be produced, indicating the sections of reefs and silt, and signs will be set up on the surface of the reefs and silt to benefit the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Hydrographic Office Dispatches Warships to Sound the Mouth of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>The Hydrographic Office, considering the water flow at the mouth of the Yellow River to be relatively slow, with sand and mud accumulating here, increasing day by day, and causing severe silting, which not only hinders navigation but also obstructs water flow, potentially leading to flooding, dispatched the Ganlu and Cheng Sheng survey ships some days ago to the mouth of the Yellow River to sound the silting situation. After the sounding work is completed, the second step will be to carry out dredging work.</p>
<h3>Jiren Funeral Assistance Society Executes New By-Laws to Aid with Coffin Materials</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization and membership drive, the Shanghai Jiren Funeral Assistance Society has successfully recruited 500 members for the "Ren" (Benevolence) group and declared its establishment. It is currently dispatching personnel to deliver material requisition reports to members household by household, and it is scheduled to begin executing its new by-laws to aid with coffin materials starting August 1st. It is also continuing to recruit members for the second group (i.e., the "Yi" [Righteousness] group), and the number of people voluntarily signing up remains enthusiastic. Yesterday (the 19th) at 1:00 PM, Mr. Shao Ruxin convened a meeting of all staff at the head office to decide on four action plans to be followed respectively: (1) The material production yard will immediately begin processing basic materials for distribution. (2) Investigators should pay attention to the length of the corpse during investigations, note it on the material requisition certificate, and issue materials based on the certificate to avoid bending the corpse. (3) The Society's material assistance completely avoids the form of charity. Therefore, employees should understand that the coffin is painted with gold "Shou" (Longevity) characters in seal script and has copper rings. They should not be arrogant, speak harshly, or urge the family of the deceased, but should allow the family to view the body calmly and express their grief. (4) The fixed cost of coffin material is set at 20 yuan per set, plus 2 yuan for lime and charcoal ash, and 3 yuan for carrying fees regardless of distance, totaling 25 yuan. Therefore, each member who assists with one coffin only needs to contribute 5 cents per share, 500 shares totaling 25 yuan, without costing the bereaved family a single penny.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Organize an Inspection Tour to China; China-Philippine Trade Association Also in the Planning Stages</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Overseas Chinese in the Philippines organized an inspection tour this spring, led by Central Committee member Wang Quansheng, to visit China and were impressed by the rapid progress of national construction. After returning to the Philippines, they reported their observations to the overseas Chinese community. The overseas Chinese community believes that trade between China and the Philippines originated very early but has gradually declined in recent years. Therefore, they are eager to cooperate with domestic merchants to seek development. At the same time, the Philippine government authorities are also willing to work with China to promote trade. Therefore, the Manila Chinese General Chamber of Commerce plans to organize a commercial inspection tour to China to conduct a detailed inspection of the needs and supply of domestic goods to promote the sale of domestic products. According to sources, during the previous visit of Overseas Chinese from the Philippines to China, they highly praised the quality of domestic products. However, due to the lack of publicity and promotion, many overseas Chinese were unaware of the true situation of domestic products. This South Seas commercial inspection tour will undoubtedly give them a good impression. Overseas Chinese are eager to love their country, so they are actively organizing commercial inspection tours to China to jointly discuss development. The organization of the China-Philippine Trade Association is reportedly still in the planning stages. Central Committee member Wang Quansheng returned to China to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and is currently staying in Beijing. He will come to Shanghai in the next few days before returning to the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Two Hurricanes Discovered in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>China's Coast Will Be Hit</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, every autumn, hurricanes often arise in the South Pacific, which is harmful to navigation. It is now learned that two more hurricanes have arisen in the South Pacific and are blowing towards the Chinese coast. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, one hurricane was in the sea area at 129 degrees east longitude and 14 degrees north latitude, with the hurricane center being 120 nautical miles, moving in a northwest direction, and the wind speed was not fast. The other hurricane was in the sea area at 114 degrees east longitude and 16 degrees north latitude, heading northwest-west, with the hurricane center being 60 nautical miles, and the wind speed was unknown. The two hurricanes are still far from Shanghai. If the direction does not change, the Chinese coast will be hit one after another.</p>
<h3>National Goods Maintenance Association Requests Postponement of Income Tax Collection; Re-implement According to Regulations Once People's Strength is Somewhat Sufficient</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association sent a telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance requesting the postponement of income tax collection, which reads: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance: We have recently read in the newspapers that the 'Provisional Regulations on Central Collection of Income Tax' are awaiting revision and implementation. According to the draft, the principles for tax collection are divided into three major categories. Except for the income of government agencies, public officials, and educational charities, all others must be collected progressively according to the amount, which is very detailed. Income tax is indeed a direct and good tax, but applying it to the current situation of widespread economic depression in our country, depleted rural economies, and declining industrial and commercial businesses is no different from giving a strong medicine to a critically ill person. The state's tax revenue may not be slightly increased, but the people's livelihoods are already on the verge of collapse. It does not seem that our government, in starting anew with the people and striving for good governance, can bear to do this. For the sake of maintaining the people's livelihood and recuperating the people's strength, our association sends this special telegram to respectfully state our case. We earnestly request your Excellency the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to be mindful of the people's difficulties and to approve a temporary postponement of income tax collection. Re-implement according to regulations once the people's strength is somewhat sufficient. We are waiting anxiously for your decision. Respectfully, Wang Jiean, Zai Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association."</p>

<h3>Case of Recovering Extraterritorial Telephone Rights; Agreement to Jointly Establish a Business Organization; Capital Still Under Negotiation, Modeled After Water and Electricity Management; Temporary Contract to be Signed Next Month Will Be Revised</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of recovering telephone rights in the extraterritorial road area of Shanghai, after the Ministry of Communications dispatched personnel to Shanghai to negotiate, a compromise solution has been decided. An independent organization will be jointly established, modeled after the extraterritorial water and electricity management. The required capital is still being estimated and negotiated, and various parties will jointly subscribe for it. It is expected to be implemented within this year. The Dagong News Agency reporter has learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process by Personnel Dispatched by the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of recovering and independently operating telephones in the extraterritorial road sections of the concession area, the Ministry of Communications dispatched Section Chief Huang of the Directorate General of Telegraphs to Shanghai at the beginning of this month to exchange opinions with various parties involved. After negotiations with the authorities of the concession telephone company, a compromise solution has been reached. The company also expressed its approval of the principle of recovering sovereignty and business cooperation. Section Chief Huang has now returned to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>The Amount of Capital to be Jointly Raised Still Needs to be Negotiated</p>
<p>After the extraterritorial telephone rights are recovered by China, the business portion will still be operated through cooperation. A separate telephone company will be established in the extraterritorial area, modeled after the water and electricity supply method. The amount of capital is still under negotiation and will be jointly raised by the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the concession's Public Works Department, and the Shanghai Telephone Company. It is said that China will hold 60% of the shares, and the concession will hold 40%. This method seems to be a joint business venture in form, but it is actually a preliminary measure to ease the situation. It has already achieved considerable success in recovering telephone sovereignty.</p>
<p>Temporary Meeting to Revise</p>
<p>The draft agreement for the recovery of telephone rights has been agreed upon by both parties and must be reviewed by the highest authorities before being issued to the competent authorities for handling. It is reported that the signing ceremony will be held in August or September, and the joint establishment of the telephone organization may be realized within this year. As for the temporary agreement signed in the past between the concession and the Chinese area, it will be revised after the official agreement to recover the telephone rights is signed and implemented.</p>
<h3>Citizens Request That Xizang Road Be Renamed Yu Qiaqing Road</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department, which reads: "To Whom It May Concern: To admire Mr. Yu Qiaqing's achievements in promoting cooperation, the public proposes to take a road to commemorate his name. We have heard that your department has already approved the principle, which is greatly appreciated. Previously, we read in the 'North China Daily News' that there were as many as three roads proposed to be renamed. Now, our association withdraws the previous request and intends to beg your department to rename Xizang Road as Yu Qiaqing Road. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter. We deeply appreciate your friendship." In addition, a letter from all businesses on Xizang Road to the Public Works Department, led by the Sino-French Pharmacy, reads: "Respectfully Submitted: We have recently learned that the public in this city intends to rename Xizang Road as Yu Qiaqing Road to commemorate him. All businesses on this road deeply agree. Therefore, we have specially sent this joint letter, hoping that you will approve it as soon as possible. We eagerly await your reply."</p>

<h3>Shanghai West National Products Exhibition Holds Lantern Parade as Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West National Products Exhibition has been open for a week since it began on the 10th of this month.

<h3>Zhu Qinglan Talks About Handling Disaster Relief for Children; Relief Association Assists in Work Relief in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing to handle the closing matters of the Shanghai fundraising for the flood victims in various provinces. Zhu told the Dagong News Agency reporter that the Relief Association is now engaged in restoring the vitality of the disaster areas in various provinces after the floods. The most important thing is to handle disaster relief for children. In addition to Fufeng, Shaanxi, and other places, where funds have been allocated and personnel have been sent to handle the matter, the disaster relief for children in the disaster area of Henan Province is currently being planned. After my best efforts to raise funds from all parties, I hope to collect a considerable amount. A few days ago, someone in the capital donated 3,000 yuan alone, designated to cover the disaster relief expenses for children in that province, which is admirable. In addition, the Relief Association is assisting the National Economic Council and various water conservancy agencies in carrying out work relief projects in various disaster-stricken provinces.</p>
<h3>Collapsing Rickshaw Mutual Aid Society Writes to the Public Works Department Requesting a Flexible Licensing Method</h3>
<p>The Collapsing Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Society of this city sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, requesting a flexible licensing method, which reads: "To Whom It May Concern: It has always been the practice to present a police donation ticket when donating and applying for licenses for collapsing rickshaws and tiger rickshaws. However, according to the facts, collapsing rickshaws and tiger rickshaws are all laborers who work hard for a living, and very few can hold this donation ticket. Therefore, when they donate and apply for licenses, they all borrow from others. This is because these laborers have no fixed place of residence on weekdays, which makes it difficult to inquire about them when something happens. The guarantee that your department investigates as a guarantee for issuing licenses has also lost its effectiveness. Regarding this matter, our association sent a letter to your department on June 20th, stating our case and suggesting that in the future, the donation certificates for collapsing rickshaws and tiger rickshaws should be changed to be certified by our association, and we will supervise the license holders to ensure that they abide by the general regulations related to traffic and transportation, in order to reduce your department's concerns. We subsequently received a reply on July 9th, stating that the suggested method was difficult to approve. According to our association, this suggestion not only reduces the labor of the laborers but also helps your department's vehicle management. Therefore, we reiterate our previous request and earnestly beg you to consider the difficulty of laborers donating and applying for licenses with tickets, and to make a decision and implement it. We also hope to receive a reply."</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Tenders for Stevedore Services</h3>
<p>Ministry Orders Promulgate Bidding Rules</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, all branches and ships have been successively restructured and ready, and business development and travel convenience have been praised, with remarkable results. The business of the warehouses and docks is more complicated, so the Ministry ordered the establishment of a Warehouse Management Office to specialize in this matter. The warehouse restructuring method has been drafted and implemented, and the stevedore services will also be tendered for contractors. All bidding rules have been promulgated by the Ministry Order. As for the bidding date, the company will publish a notice in the newspaper in the next few days.

Article 5: The bidding for each warehouse listed in Article 2 will be held separately in sequence. Bidders may not bid for other warehouses when bidding for each warehouse. A winning bidder for any warehouse may not be a bidder for any other warehouse. Article 6: After the public opening of bids, the company will select one winning bidder and one alternate winning bidder for each warehouse from the bids submitted, based on the lowest price and abundant experience, and notify them in writing. If the company believes that none of the bid prices submitted by the bidders are qualified, it may reschedule the bidding. Article 7: The winning bidder shall, within five days after the company issues a written notice, invite a shareholder and a substantial shop to come to the company to sign a contract (the formal contract will be handled in accordance with the draft contract attached to the bid receipt, and the bidder shall not request modification), and return the bidding deposit based on the certificate, and separately pay the contracting stevedore deposit, and the company will issue a receipt for storage.

<h3>Opening of the Chinese Cultural Relics Exhibition</h3>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders a Ban on Yellow River and Charity Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery issued by Hebei Province previously had a limit of twelve issues and ended as scheduled. In April of this year, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee requested to continue issuing the Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery to raise funds for relief, as the Yellow River's aftermath in Hebei had not been resolved. The Ministry of Finance replied that the lottery was issued temporarily as a matter of expediency for urgent relief, and it seemed inappropriate to continue issuing it. Moreover, the plan for both addressing the symptoms and root causes of the Yellow River flood had already been handled by the responsible agency, so there seemed to be no need to continue issuing the lottery. The Executive Yuan had already ordered the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee to comply. However, in the past two months, the Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery has continued to be issued, and the Tianjin Municipal Public Welfare Charity Lottery has also been promoted in various places. It has been found that neither of these lotteries has been approved by the government and should be strictly prohibited from sale to maintain the law. The Executive Yuan approved the Ministry of Finance's reply, stating that since there was no need to continue issuing the Yellow River lottery, and the so-called Tianjin Municipal Public Welfare Charity Lottery had not been reported, it should be strictly prohibited. A special telegram was sent to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, ordering it to investigate and terminate the issuance and instructed the provincial and municipal governments to comply and instruct their subordinates to strictly prohibit sales.</p>

<h3>Another Rickshaw Theft Occurs in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession authorities arrested and severely punished the main culprits involved in rickshaw thefts last December, there had been no reported cases of stolen rickshaws for several months.

<h3>Bookbinders Demand World Book Company Restore Original Prices</h3>
<p>Workers Plan to Form "Kneeling and Crying" Group</p>
<p>According to Guomin She, the bookbinders who contract with the World Book Company in this city include 21 firms such as Liu Peiji, Zhou Shunji, Wang Jinji, and Sun Yongji. It is said that previously only five firms contracted with the book company, but the World Book Company has continuously added workshops, and now there are as many as 21. Every time a new binding firm is added, the binding fee is reduced once. In 1932, it was 9 角 2 分 5 厘 per ten thousand pages, and has gradually decreased to less than 6 角 per ten thousand pages now. The various bookbinders have been repeatedly reduced the binding fee by the book company, and are all feeling straitened and struggling to maintain. Now affected by the economic depression and the rising cost of living, all bookbinders feel difficult and are unable to maintain the status quo. It is learned that 21 bookbinding firms and workers are unanimously uniting to demand that the World Book Company restore original prices. It is also heard that the first step is to send representatives from the bookbinding firms to demand this from the book company. If there is no result, the workers will continue to rise up in assistance, and it is learned that the workers are planning to organize a kneeling and crying group, compile a booklet to expose the inside story of the book company, and kneel and cry to various public groups for assistance in upholding justice. The 21 bookbinding firms have sent Zhou Shunquan, Liu Peisheng, and others to the factory once to negotiate, but the company has not yet given a substantial reply.</p>
<h3>Police Shoot Fleeing Thief; Body Recovered Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Suiming, a road policeman at the Wusong Machinery Factory, took the thief Xie Xiaoanzi to the Baotai Wan ship to retrieve a pawn ticket for stolen goods. When Xie was unprepared, he suddenly jumped into the river and tried to escape. Officer Li fired his gun, and Xie was hit and killed, his body sinking to the bottom of the river. Yesterday afternoon, the police hired workers to recover the body, and ordered the local head to report to the local court, which sent a prosecutor to the scene to confirm that the death was caused by a gunshot wound (the bullet entered from the back and exited from the front of the chest). The body was placed in a coffin by a charity and prepared for burial, pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Conferring Honorary Title on Yuan's Mother Will Be Held Soon</h3>
<p>Yuan Ludeng, a native of Ningbo, is a well-known merchant in Shanghai. His mother, Madam Hu, passed away on June 9th of this year. Because Madam Hu had a strong belief in religion during her lifetime, customs such as mourning were all eliminated. Now, those who had a past with the Yuan family believe that Madam Hu did good deeds and promoted education, and made contributions to society, so her passing cannot be without commemoration. Therefore, following the example of Song Xuanwen and Meng Deyao in ancient times, they will initiate a preparatory committee for conferring an honorary title on Yuan's mother, and circulate letters to Yuan's relatives and friends to discuss the honorary title, to highlight her virtuous qualities. Now, after more than a thousand people used written nominations, the deadline was the 15th of this month. The words "慈惠" (Cihui - Benevolent and Kind) were the most numerous, so she is called Madam Cihui, and they plan to choose a day to hold the ceremony of conferring the honorary title, to show solemnity. It is heard that recently those who have joined the ceremony are still continuously increasing, and the ceremony will definitely be a lively affair in the future.</p>

<h3>Inmates Riot and Escape; Responsible Persons Must Be Severely Punished According to Law; Escaped Inmates Must Be Apprehended Within a Limited Time; Heads of Respective Institutions Should Also Be Disciplined</h3>
<p>The Special District Court of Shanghai received an instruction from the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday: "Recently, cases of inmates in prisons escaping have been occurring almost daily in various provinces, and cases of inmates rioting in groups are also frequently seen. Although this is due to the imperfect construction of prisons in various counties, it is also due to the lack of effective supervision by prison officials. However, a major reason is the failure to provide thorough warnings regarding the various laws concerning the escape of inmates beforehand, and the failure to strictly enforce them afterwards. All prisons should be ordered to promptly compile matters for inmates to comply with while in prison, and to appropriately add and revise the matters for inmates to comply with while in prison promulgated by the Beijing Ministry of Justice two years ago, and to include the full text of Article 161 and Article 162 of the Criminal Law, Article 1, Paragraph 19 of the Provisional Measures for Handling Banditry Cases promulgated by the Central Government in August of last year, and Article 29 of the Inmate Regulations and Article 43 of the Detention Center Regulations, and print multiple copies for posting in the wards for reading. Those who are illiterate should be explained in detail to provide a warning. The responsibilities of prison staff and their supervisors have already been stipulated and notified in Article 161 of the Criminal Law and this Ministry's Instruction No. 5562 last year, respectively, and are hereby notified again for compliance. Hereafter, attention must be paid to organizing matters for reducing inmates' protection in various prisons. If there are any more escapes, the escaped inmates will certainly be apprehended within a limited time and severely punished according to law. If the personnel responsible for the prison are involved in criminal suspicion, they should also be severely punished according to law, and the heads of the respective institutions should also be disciplined in accordance with the previous order, and no leniency will be shown. Each must obey respectfully and not neglect."</p>
<h3>Female Thief Sentenced</h3>
<p>Chen Meizhen, a Suzhou woman residing at Tai'an Lane, 207 Rue Bayle, French Concession, was broken into at night in March of this year by her fellow townsman Ma Laoliu, who used to work with her in a room at the Changsan brothel, and two men. They displayed a handgun, first blindfolded Chen Meizhen, and then, directed by Ma Laoliu, searched and stole a diamond ring, gold jewelry, and cash, totaling over 700 yuan. They then fled. During the robbery, the blindfold on Meizhen's face loosened, allowing her to recognize the female thief's face and report it to the police. The suspect was not apprehended until the end of last month, when the victim encountered Ma Laoliu near the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Avenue du Contre Amiral Courbet in the Public Concession. She stepped forward and apprehended her, and called the police to take her to the police station, which transferred her to the French Concession Police Station. According to Ma's confession, she went to commit the robbery with her estranged lover Pan Haiyuan and Pan's younger brother A Si, who is still at large. Pan Haiyuan was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. Investigator Liu Jinrong checked with the silver shop and found the date when Ma Laoliu sold the jewelry, and a receipt was reissued and sent to the court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution for robbery. During the trial presided over by Judge Li Changnian, Ma Laoliu claimed that she had borrowed money from the plaintiff unsuccessfully and took the opportunity to commit a theft, denying that she had organized a robbery. Pan Haiyuan denied any involvement and claimed to have been falsely accused, and each hired a lawyer to defend them. The details had been reported in this newspaper. The case has now concluded. At 8 AM the day before yesterday, Judge Li delivered his verdict in Criminal Division One, sentencing Ma Laoliu to six months in prison and acquitting Pan Haiyuan. During the appeal period, Ma will be held in detention, and Pan is allowed bail pending a decision.</p>
<h3>Liu Haisu Exhibition Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Russian Ambassador and Sun Yat-sen Institute President Visited the Exhibition; Liu Haisu's art exhibition closed yesterday, the last day, at 1 PM. Visitors continued to arrive in an endless stream. Russian Ambassador Bogomolov, accompanied by the embassy counselor and the director of the Cultural Promotion Department, as well as British Consul General Bayly, visited the exhibition for a long time and purchased the fifth painting, "Clear Pond at Noon," worth 400 yuan. The Russian ambassador highly praised Liu's art and was eager to meet him. The clerk, Song Banggan, telephoned Liu, who had just returned to Shanghai from Beijing that morning. Liu and his wife immediately went to the exhibition to greet the ambassador, and they had a very pleasant conversation. The Russian ambassador hoped that Liu could hold an exhibition in Moscow next spring, and Liu promised to consider it. Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Legislative Member Wu Jingxiong, Li Zhaohuan, the President of Jiaotong University, and others also visited the exhibition. They all agreed that Liu's oil paintings and traditional Chinese paintings were profound, vigorous, and creative, representing a turning point in the history of Chinese art. President Sun purchased painting number 74, "Knowing the White, Keeping the Black," and Wu Jingxiong also booked "Su Dongpo and His Two Friends."</p>
<h3>"Women's Army" Gang Commits Violence; Bounced Check Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>Yang Xintian, a 35-year-old Chongming native, who makes a living playing mahjong, residing at No. 5, Alley 16, Dengyun Lane, purchased 171 yuan worth of artificial mahjong tiles from Wang Bomei (30 years old), a Yongbo native, at the Xie Feng Industrial Cooperative at No. 2 Yuqing Lane, Xietu Road, last month. He signed a check from the Jianye Bank for 122 yuan, with the remaining amount to be paid at the end of the month. When Wang tried to cash the check, it bounced. Wang contacted Yang, but Yang avoided him. A few days ago, Wang happened to meet Yang Xintian at the Yiyuan Teahouse in the Chenghuangmiao Yuyuan, but Yang evaded responsibility. Wang called police officer Su Yushu to take Yang to the Chenghuangmiao Police Station for questioning. Officer Chen interrogated him and found that the case involved the use of a bounced check, which constituted fraud, and ordered that he be handed over for further investigation. Unexpectedly, at 3 PM yesterday, Yang's wife, Ms. Lu, together with her mother, Ms. Lu Shi, led several members of a "women's army" to Wang's residence, claiming that her whole family relied on her husband alone to earn a living, and that if Wang did not drop the case, her entire family would move in to live with him. Wang was out at the time. Yang and Ms. Lu returned to the Yiyuan in Chenghuangmiao to meet Wang's younger brother, Boxun, and falsely accused Boxun of using violent means to take away 42 sets of mahjong tiles worth over 200 yuan, demanding that they be used to offset the debt and that the difference be paid in cash. Boxun argued that the accusation was fabricated. During the dispute, Yang and Ms. Lu directed the "women's army" to beat Boxun over the head, and he cried out for help. When the patrol officer arrived, he only arrested the leaders Yang and Ms. Lu Shi. The injured Wang Boxun was sent to the hospital for treatment. After questioning, Officer Chen found that the defendants had committed violence with a gang, and the case involved injury, and they were handed over to the bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Underage Girl Cannot File a Lawsuit Independently; Marriage Fraud and Abandonment Case Needs Review</h3>
<p>Zhu Liangqing, the owner of the Tongtaihe cigarette paper shop at No. 193, Lane at the intersection of Old Barricade Road and Haineng Road, was recently criminally prosecuted by Ma Shanbao, a 19-year-old Suzhou woman, who hired lawyer Huang Renchong to file a case with the First Special Court for marriage fraud and abandonment. The reasons given were that Ma's father died when she was six years old, her mother died when she was twelve years old, and she relied on her maternal grandmother, Shen Xu, to raise her. In May of the year before last, her maternal grandmother was deceived by the defendant and promised Ma to the defendant for cohabitation. At that time, the plaintiff was under the age of sixteen, young and ignorant. On June 23 of that year, she began cohabiting with the defendant in the building above the bamboo shop on Peng Road, and repeatedly urged him to formally marry, but he made all sorts of excuses. In November of last year, his legal wife arrived in Shanghai, and he drove the plaintiff away, revealing that she had been deceived. The defendant's actions constitute a violation of Article 229 of the Criminal Law, using fraud to make a woman mistakenly believe that he is her spouse and submit to his adultery, and Article 294 of the same law, abandonment. The lawsuit includes civil claims and asks the court to order the payment of 15 yuan per month in living expenses from June 24 of this year until she is 60 years old. Yesterday morning, Judge Tan Xinzhen presided over the hearing in Criminal Division Eight. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. After questioning, Judge Tan stated that the plaintiff, Ma Shanbao, is only 19 years old and has not yet reached adulthood, and therefore is not allowed to file a lawsuit independently according to law. Therefore, there appears to be a procedural impropriety, and the case will be reviewed and re-examined.</p>
<h3>Zhao Heming's Concubine Flees; Ling Peng Accused of Enticement; Cohabitant Introduced Them; Once Planned to Escape to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Zhao Heming, a local resident residing at 57 Pingliang Road, 26 years old, recently hired lawyers Li Lin and Xi Xiaoruo to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court against Ling Peng and Song Peigen for attempting to entice a woman under the age of 20 away from her family, and filed a civil lawsuit along with it. The statement of claim stated that the plaintiff's concubine, Ying Xiuzhen, 19 years old, had been cohabiting with the plaintiff at No. 7, Lane 57, Pingliang Road. On June 9 of this year, Ying Xiuzhen suddenly ran away while the plaintiff was out. Before leaving, she left a note falsely claiming that she was returning to her mother's home in Ningbo. The plaintiff initially did not suspect anything. On the 15th of the same month, he discovered that 800 yuan in cash and jewelry and clothing that he had purchased for Ying Xiuzhen, which he had hidden in an iron box, had disappeared. He suspected that she had run away and sent a telegram to Ningbo to inquire at Ying's mother's house. They replied that she had not returned to Ningbo. He then investigated everywhere, and on the 23rd, he found Ying Xiuzhen hiding at Yan Shanmei's place, a "little sister," at No. 34 Lishi Lane, Lujiabang, Nanshi. He reported the incident to the police, who arrested Ying and Yan and sent them to the Shanghai Local Court. According to Ying Xiuzhen's confession, her departure was due to Song Peigen, who lived in the same house as the plaintiff, acting as an intermediary. She met Ling Peng and became intimate with him. Ling had originally planned to take her to Ningbo on June 8. However, because she felt it was inappropriate, she did not go. Ling missed his stop and was taken to Ningbo. The next day, he called her, asking her to take the cash and go to Ningbo. Ling waited at the dock and invited her to the Dongya Hotel in Ningbo, and then they returned to Shanghai, renting a house at No. 375 Penglai Road. The 800 yuan in cash that she had taken was taken out and used by Ling. Therefore, the defendants have clearly violated Article 240, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Criminal Law, and the lawsuit includes civil claims, asking the court to order compensation of 800 yuan in national currency. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye presided over the hearing in the Criminal Court. Neither of the defendants arrived, and each commissioned a lawyer to appear in court and request a postponement. The plaintiff, Zhao Heming, submitted the case, stating the above situation. The court decided that because the defendants had not arrived, the hearing would be rescheduled in seven days.</p>
<h3>China Poultry Association Presents to Ministry of Education: Unify Translated Names of Poultry Books</h3>
<p>In recent years, the new method of poultry farming in our country has become increasingly popular thanks to the efforts and promotion of various poultry farming academic organizations. There are also many books on poultry farming published in the market. However, most of the books are translated from Europe, America, and Japan. Due to differences in translation styles, the translated academic and breed names are also different. The same English name, after being translated into Chinese, has as many as four or five different versions. This creates many obstacles to academic research and promotion. The China Poultry Academic Research Association at No. 534 Xiangyin Road in the city center submitted a request to the Ministry of Education yesterday, asking to unify the translated names of poultry farming academics and breeds nationwide. At the same time, the president of the association, Zhang Ruizhi, has prepared a complete list of translated names for the Ministry of Education's reference.</p>
<h3>Abduction Case Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Xiao Mei, the seven-year-old daughter of Xu Liyuan, a Ningbo native residing at No. 57 Xinwen Road, disappeared while playing at the back door at 5 PM on the 8th of this month. He asked people to search for her without success and reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhang Faxiang, it was learned that Wu Aisheng, a Wuxi native residing at No. 33 Rue d'Euclidis had a relationship with the case. He was arrested and confessed that Xu's daughter was hidden at No. 57 Shajing Road by a person named Xiao Chen. They rushed to the address to arrest them. Xiao Chen escaped upon hearing the news. Xu's daughter was found downstairs and brought to the police station. The next morning, the suspect was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The girl was returned to her father. During the rescheduling, Detective Zhang learned that there was an accomplice, Niu Boliang, from Songjiang, hiding at No. 274 Menggu Road, Zhabei. He secretly contacted the public security bureau of the jurisdiction and arrested Niu at the address. He was brought back to the police station. Yesterday, he and Wu were sent to Criminal Division Three. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated that it was found that the two defendants, together with Xiao Chen who was at large, had abducted two girls, one four years old and one eight years old, from a certain place between December of last year and February of this year. They were sold to Chen Peichang at No. 16 Rue d'Euclidis, the eight-year-old girl for 40 yuan and the four-year-old girl for 26 yuan, and the money was divided and spent. Currently, Chen Peichang at No. 16 Rue d'Euclidis has fled without a trace due to unpaid rent, and he cannot be arrested. The families of the two girls cannot be found and identified. It is requested that the case be punished according to law. Judge Xiao Fenfen questioned the two defendants clearly and ordered them to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>House Collapse Injures People in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The three side rooms of the house of Jiang Yuqin, a local who works at the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Transfer Company, collapsed at No. 24 Jiangjiatang in the south of Hongqiao Town in West Shanghai. Due to years of disrepair, the beams and pillars were decaying, and coupled with the continuous strong winds and heavy rains, the entire hall collapsed suddenly at about 5 PM yesterday, causing a loss of about 200 yuan. Yuqin's wife, Ms. Gu, was at home in Shanghai at the time. Only his elderly mother, Ms. Wang, was unable to escape in time and was severely injured.

<h3>Shop Assistant Seduces Shop Owner's Daughter; Secret Pregnancy, They Flee Together; Tracked Down and Arrested</h3>
<p>Bao Hefeng, a Ningbo native, runs a cigarette paper and sundry goods shop at No. 1209 Qujiang Road in Zhabei. Bao has a daughter named Aizhu, 19 years old, who is studying at junior high school. There was a shop assistant named Huang Jinbao, from Wangqiao, Xicheng Town, outside the West Gate of Jiading County. Seeing that Aizhu had some beauty, he seduced her into an affair. Recently, because Aizhu was four months pregnant and afraid of being discovered by her parents, Huang Jinbao accompanied her to Jiading on a Xihu long-distance bus on the 15th of this month. They temporarily rented a Pan-family house outside the West Gate as a place to hide her. When Aizhu left home, she left a letter stating that she was going out to commit suicide because she was not free. But Aizhu's parents already knew that she had been lured out by Huang Jinbao, so they sent their son-in-law, Xu Zhongsheng, to Jiading to find her. He found her at the Pan family's house outside the West Gate. He reported the incident to the police and arrested Aizhu, Huang Jinbao, and Huang's brother, Mu Liang. At the same time, Aizhu's mother and brother, Hu Tianyi, also heard the news and rushed to the Jiading County Public Security Bureau, asking them to transfer the case to the county government for trial.</p>
<h3>Ship Hand Falls into River; Body Missing</h3>
<p>Yuan Xiaohua, 24 years old, a local resident, was a ship hand in the Huangpu River. At 10 AM yesterday, he and another ship hand were carrying passengers across the river.

<h3>County Government Maintains Waterborne Security</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government hereby investigates that the jurisdiction of this county often connects to the Huangpu River, where bandit gangs can easily emerge. Recently, incidents of robbery on land and water have occurred repeatedly. Land-based defense has already been strengthened by the Public Security Bureau and security teams. However, waterborne defense should also be given attention to ensure that bandit gangs have no place to stand. In addition to following provincial orders to instruct all districts to organize waterborne Baobias, given the unpredictable nature of vessels in the Huangpu River, thoroughness cannot be expected without regular inspections.  Orders have now been issued for each district to establish offices separately, assign personnel to be responsible for handling, to eradicate bandit traces and maintain security.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, upon reading a news item titled "Theft of Large Amount of Cigarettes Solved in Nanhui County Bandit Hideout" on page 13 of section 4 of your newspaper dated July 17, which stated that the original cigarette thief was found at the residence of Baozhang Pan Xukui in our township, and Wu Jiasheng, who was arrested, confessed to the water patrol that he was the deputy head of the Xiukang Township Defense Corps in the Fifth District of Nanhui County, we were shocked. After investigation, our township has a total of thirteen Baos, and there is no such person as Pan Shukui among the thirteen Baozhangs. Moreover, the Baozhangs of each Bao were issued appointment letters by the District Office at that time and reported to the County Government. Since he is neither the former nor the current officer, how could he falsely claim the position? It is extremely despicable. Now, for the sake of credibility among all sectors, we must disclose the names of the thirteen Baozhangs in our township one by one, which are: Liu Xingen, Baozhang of the first Bao; Ding Zhiying, Baozhang of the second Bao; Ye Yizhang, Baozhang of the third Bao; Ding Miaosheng, Baozhang of the fourth Bao; Zhang Guiqing, Baozhang of the fifth Bao; Zhang Zhenlin, Baozhang of the sixth Bao; Qin Xingeng, Baozhang of the seventh Bao; Fan Chunsheng, Baozhang of the eighth Bao; Zhang Fuxiu, Baozhang of the ninth Bao; Cao Fuxi, Baozhang of the tenth Bao; Zhu Caigen, Baozhang of the eleventh Bao; Wang Julin, Baozhang of the twelfth Bao; Yao Zhanglong, Baozhang of the thirteenth Bao. Furthermore, the accomplice named Wu Jiasheng does not reside in our township and is not the deputy head of the Defense Corps of our township. This can be easily inquired and verified, and it is not difficult to clarify the truth. We suspect that the reporter at the time may have reported inaccurate rumors. We are deeply concerned that such an error will affect the reputation of our township office. We hereby request that the editor make a correction in the letter to the editor section of your newspaper. Sincerely, Wang Julin, Township Head of Xiukang Township, Fifth District, Nanhui County, July 18.</p>

<h3>Ten Countries Participating in This Year's Olympic Football Tournament England Has Not Yet Registered But Is Prepared to Participate The Netherlands Has Difficulty Resolving the Problem of Player Salary Losses</h3>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) Football - the "King of Balls" - has more changes in the history of the Olympic Games than other sports. Since 1908, it has been listed as one of the Olympic events. When the Olympic Games were held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in 1928, opinions differed on whether the football teams had violated the Olympic amateur rules, which involved the entire football participation in the Olympic Games. The dispute was intense and difficult to resolve. In the end, the opposition won, so the football competition was cancelled when the 10th Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, USA, in 1932. However, in the International Football Association convened in Rome in the autumn of 1934, it was decided that football would still be included in the Olympic program, so that football teams from various countries could participate in the competition. This resolution did not contradict the original intention of cancelling participation due to amateur problems, but rather to increase the interest of the Olympic Committee itself. The Olympic Games to be held in Berlin this summer will implement this resolution and add football competitions, and many have now joined.</p>
<p>Twenty countries have already participated in the football competition of this year's World Games, and the registration procedures have been completed long ago. However, England, which is known for football, has not yet made a move. Football is most common in England, so whether England will participate is a major issue that has attracted the attention of the world. According to the 4th and 5th World Games held in London in 1908 and Stockholm in 1912, the football championships were won by England. England did not participate in the 8th and 9th World Games held in Paris and Amsterdam. The proposal to participate in the Berlin World Games this year was put forward by Dr. Bao Wen, a international referee. He has already submitted a written proposal to prepare for participation, and at the same time, he is soliciting opinions from the best amateur teams in England. A final decision will be made soon. News from London says that England can organize a strong football team to participate in this year's World Games.</p>
<p>Whether the Netherlands will send a football team to participate in the World Games is also a serious issue for the Dutch sports community. It is the general opinion that the Royal Dutch Football Association should organize a team to participate, because the Netherlands is a first-class football country, so the Netherlands not sending a football team is the same as the United States not sending a track and field team. However, the problem of how to compensate for the loss of salary for football players due to participating in the World Games is difficult to solve for a while, and efforts are currently being made. Recently, a Dutch travel agency has purchased 1,000 World Games tickets to meet the needs of 1,000 spectators who will go to watch the Dutch football team's match on the day or the day before. From this, it can be seen that the Netherlands is enthusiastic about football, and of course no one will undermine the legitimate hope of participating this time.</p>
<h3>International Swimming Competition Held on August 8th</h3>
<p>Ten Programs Water Polo Performance May Be Changed to Competition China Team Pre-Selection Starts on the 25th Registration Opens Soon</p>
<p>The annual Shanghai International Swimming Championship, this year is the fifth edition. Previously, as most of the athletes from the United Kingdom and the United States returned home, there was once a proposal to suspend it a month ago.

The programs are the same as in previous years, but the water polo performance may be changed to a formal scoring competition.

The Shanghai City Open Swimming Championship has been set for the fourth week of August, and the location is also the French Chamber of Commerce. The China team's pre-selection has been decided to be held on the 25th of this month, and registration will start soon.</p>

In the summer of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), he graduated from the School of Science of Fudan University in Shanghai with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. He served as an engineer, section chief, and director of the Ganjiang Bridge exploration team on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for a total of six years. In view of the rapid development of foreign engineering technology in recent years, he has been sponsored by the railway bureau and raised his own funds to study at the graduate school of Cornell University in the United States, specializing in civil engineering, with a focus on bridge engineering. The term is two years. After the term expires, he plans to visit the latest construction projects in Europe and the United States and return to China via Europe. The Globe China Student Association has completed all the procedures for going abroad and has decided to set sail on the President Grant on August 18th.</p>
<h3>The Basic Work of Educational and Career Guidance (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— He Qing</p>
<p>I. Investigating Students' Individual Situations As we mentioned earlier, students' individual situations vary. In superficial aspects, such as age, gender, and place of origin, there is no need to discuss them. In more important aspects, such as general intelligence, special abilities, academic performance, physical condition, extracurricular activities, aspirations, interests, and family environment, there are also differences. These differences have different effects on the problems that arise. In addition to these situations, individual problems are also included, because educational problems and career problems should be distinguished, and the content of educational problems or career problems can be further analyzed.</p>
<p>Investigating students' situations includes these items, and it cannot be completed in a short time. Especially in schools with a large number of students, it must be carried out at any time during the weekdays. It is best to do so within the last year, because if the time is too long, it will become ineffective and inaccurate when it is applied. This kind of investigation must adopt the prescribed forms and be carried out effectively. Some of the materials required can be provided by the students themselves, and some need to be collected from various sources.</p>
<p>Although materials can be collected from various sources, this kind of investigation must be centrally managed and directed by designated persons responsible for guidance and planning. All teachers and staff in the school should assist and cooperate in the investigation work, but if there is no one in charge, it will not be able to continue and achieve satisfactory results. With an investigation, there will be a solid basis when implementing guidance, and the proposed solutions will be effective. Therefore, this kind of investigation is one of the basic works in guidance.</p>
<p>II. Collecting School and Career Materials In order to solve any guidance problem, in addition to clearly understanding the individual's situation as a basis, the career materials related to the problem should also be collected completely. Educational problems must have a list of regulations of various advanced schools (universities) or other materials for reference. Career problems must have investigations on career content, needs, and opportunities. These two kinds of materials have basic importance, and they cannot be completed in a short time. They must be solicited at any time during the weekdays in order to be sufficient. The reference materials on schools are naturally limited to those that have a considerable relationship with the students of this school. As for the career references, they should be limited to the scope related to the students of this school and the local community. Neither is broad and universal, so it may not be the same for schools in different regions. As for collection and investigation, some materials need to be carried out independently by each school, some can be done in cooperation with several schools, and some have already had considerable investigations by other agencies, which can be conveniently adopted. How to proceed should be decided according to the situation. In any case, in a school that implements guidance, there must be a person in charge of planning, organizing, and preserving various investigation materials. This work is as important as the management of investigating individual situations. It can also be done by one person, because both sides of the investigation work, as well as other guidance work, require a long time and energy, so it is best to have a full-time career guidance officer to avoid being added incidentally to other teachers and staff, so that they cannot have sufficient care.</p>
<p>III. Implementing Individual Guidance After investigating the students' situations, it is not enough to just save the results of the investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to serve as a basis for guidance, so guidance is a method and a step in the process, not the ultimate goal. When investigating, individual problems have been discovered, and then practical guidance should be implemented according to the individual problems and referring to all relevant materials. Whether it is an educational problem or a career problem, it must be realistic individual guidance in order to hope to get a solution. The so-called individual guidance is that the person in charge of guidance holds individual talks with students, discusses the students' problems, provides relevant references, and suggests solutions. This kind of individual talk is best concentrated and undertaken by the commissioner responsible for guidance, but sometimes the assistance of other teachers and staff is also needed. This kind of talk is not limited to one time. The number of times depends on the nature of the problem, and it cannot be fixed at one time for each person, or a few minutes each time. It must be flexible according to the individual situation.</p>
<p>Although individual guidance should be the responsibility of a special person, the guidance given often needs to be based on references from all parties. The plan for further study or further education should sometimes consult the teachers concerned. The economic situation and family environment should be requested from the parents. The health situation should refer to the doctor's opinion. Other aspects related to the problem should also be sought for suggestions. Therefore, the person in charge of guidance should become the center of guidance, integrating the opinions of all parties, and implementing the methods of disposal. It is not a hasty, arbitrary, or simple task, nor can it be completed temporarily or at the last minute.</p>
<p>IV. Contacting All Parties Outside the School Whether it is an educational problem or a career problem, students will have relationships with all parties outside the school, and career problems are even more so. Students going on to further education will have relationships with higher-level schools. If the school in charge of guidance can have considerable contact with each school, or invite the person in charge of each school to give a lecture at the school, or arrange for students of this school to visit each school, or have other contacts, it can provide many conveniences for students. As for students seeking employment, they need career opportunities. This kind of opportunity must be generated by students having considerable contact with various organizations in society.</p>
<p>An important purpose of contact is to express the achievements of this school. For schools going on to further education and for organizations seeking employment, a school must be able to express where it can contribute in order to arouse the possibility of cooperation. This kind of publicity should naturally be based on facts. If the school's performance is poor, society will naturally not be willing to cooperate, and students will feel that their way out is difficult. Therefore, contact with all parties is not an empty exchange or a false courtesy, but a pursuit of cooperation based on achievements.</p>
<p>The work of contact should also be the responsibility of a special person, and it cannot be arbitrarily entrusted to anyone. The person in charge of guidance can, of course, also take on this part of the work, but if it is too busy due to other work, or there are other inconvenient reasons, another person can be responsible. It is most appropriate for the leader of the school to take on the task because of the convenience of the position. No matter who takes on the task, this work should always be regarded as a formal part of guidance.</p>
<p>The above four types of work, we believe, are the most basic work for secondary schools to implement educational or career guidance. If these items can be fully and effectively implemented, even without other work, guidance can have a good effect. From these types of work, we can see that guidance is a part of education, which should be implemented on weekdays and focus on individual guidance. If we can recognize these tasks, the incorrect concepts of guidance can also be eliminated.</p>
<p>However, these tasks have a common prerequisite, that is, no matter which part of the work, there should be a special person in charge. It can also be said that to carry out educational and career guidance, there must be a special person to plan and implement it, and then it can be properly implemented and have substantial results. Without a special person, this career has nothing to rely on, which is equivalent to a mere formality. Therefore, those who intend to implement educational or career guidance must recognize the importance and long-term nature of this work and entrust the responsible person to plan and implement it. Then we can hope for the development of this career and that students can get more real benefits. (End)</p>

<h3>The North China Textile Industry Under Japanese Control</h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>Recently, news about the decline of China's cotton textile industry has been continuously reported. According to last month's (June) statistics, the total number of yarn spindles in Chinese-owned mills nationwide is more than 2.7 million, with over 140,000 thread spindles, and more than 20,000 looms. However, 31.5% of the yarn spindles are idle, and among the 68.5% that are operating, 12.4% have reduced production, and 10% are about to reduce production. As for thread spindles and looms, a significant number are also idle. This situation is much worse than last year, which was already the worst year.</p>
<p>However, while Chinese-owned factories are closing down, selling off assets, and reducing production, Japanese-owned mills operating in China are continuously buying up factories, adding new ones, increasing spindles, and expanding production, achieving astonishing growth. Considering only yarn spindles for now, it is reported that they have reached a massive number of over 2.45 million, an increase of more than 500,000 compared to last year's 1.94 million, and the planned increases are not even included in this number.</p>
<p>Although Japanese capital has not abandoned Shanghai and Wuhan, it is evident that their focus has shifted to North China. This is closely related to the development of abnormal political power. Fundamentally, it is also part of the so-called "economic cooperation" invasion policy!</p>
<p>The active shift of Japanese mills towards North China began last year. In that year, Japanese merchants established three new factories in China, all concentrated in the Qingdao area. These include:</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Toyota Automatic Loom Works of Japan invested in the only Chinese-owned mill in Qingdao, Huaxin Yarn Factory, under a disguised form. Although nominally for replacing old machines with new ones, in reality, it is no different from the Chinese factory surrendering to Japanese capital. Therefore, the textile industry in Qingdao can be said to be entirely in the hands of Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>Moreover, this year, Japanese merchants have placed even greater emphasis on Tianjin, as it is a major industrial and commercial area in China, making business operations much more convenient. At the same time, Tianjin is under the jurisdiction of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and is adjacent to the puppet autonomous region of Eastern Hebei, placing it directly and indirectly under Japanese political influence. This allows them to connect economic aggression and political aggression on the same line. They are not only focused on North China, but also intend to make Tianjin the center for monopolizing the yarn market throughout China.</p>
<p>Japanese mills are entering and expanding in Tianjin through the following three methods: (1) buying up Chinese factories, (2) expanding existing factories, and (3) adding new factories. Under the strategy of buying up Chinese factories, the existing factories in Tianjin have successively fallen into the hands of Japanese capital. The current situation of the local Chinese-owned yarn factories is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Yuyuan: This is the largest yarn factory in Tianjin, established in April of the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), with a capital of 5.6 million yuan. Internally, it is divided into the first, second, and third yarn factories and a weaving factory, with a total of 71,360 yarn spindles, 9,760 thread spindles, 1,000 looms, and 3,000 workers. Due to poor business performance in recent years, it has accumulated debts, and announced a shutdown on January 11th last year. As of last year, it owed a total of 5.17 million yuan in secured debt to Chinese and Japanese consortiums, of which the loan from Okura &amp; Co. of Japan amounted to more than 3.3 million Japanese yen, accounting for more than 60%. In addition, 3 million shares have also flowed into Japanese hands. Due to Okura &amp; Co.'s urgent demand for repayment and the machinations of Japanese shareholders, it had no choice but to liquidate and sell. Japanese merchants had long intended to swallow this factory. Lending money and acquiring shares were merely tactics in the process of annexation. After a long period of preparation, Yuyuan Yarn Factory was officially acquired by Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. of Japan in May of this year. It is currently actively renovating its machinery and equipment, with operations scheduled to start in September. After resuming operations, it plans to expand to 150,000 spindles. In addition to spinning fine yarn, it will also engage in weaving cotton cloth. As for the name, it will likely be changed to Gongda No. 6 Factory. From then on, the largest yarn factory in Tianjin has fallen into the hands of Japanese capital, and an important fighter in the national industry has lost its final fate!</p>
<p>Beiyang: With a capital of 3.9 million yuan, it has a total of 26,752 yarn spindles, 2,128 thread spindles, and more than 1,300 workers, with a daily output of more than 60 bales. Due to excessive losses, it temporarily shut down in June of last year. Subsequently, it increased its capital by 200,000 yuan, reorganized, and resumed operations, but recently it was unable to struggle and declared bankruptcy again. Last month (June), the factory was also acquired by Japanese capital, and the successor is Shanghai Yufeng Yarn Factory. (Editor's note: The Tianjin telegram of this newspaper on the 17th stated that only Hengyuan and Beiyang No. 3 factories are left under the management of Chinese.)</p>
<p>Baocheng: With a capital of 3 million yuan, it has a total of 27,028 yarn spindles, 2,520 thread spindles, and 1,200 workers, with a daily output of 53 bales. The factory's products were originally mostly sold to the Northeast. Since the Northeast was lost, the market was cut off, resulting in increasing losses and making it impossible to continue operations. On July 17th, it was auctioned off by the creditor bank group and was formally acquired by Okura Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. of Yuda Yarn Factory for a price of 1.375 million yuan, officially falling under Japanese ownership.</p>
<p>Huaxin: With a capital of over 2.42 million yuan, it has a total of 27,072 yarn spindles and 1,000 workers. The factory's machinery and hygiene facilities are among the best of all factories. Unfortunately, due to the decline in business, internal shareholders have recently had deep disagreements. According to the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month, it is showing signs of being sold off like Yuyuan, Beiyang, and Baocheng. At the same time, the Japanese side is watching intently. It is reported that the Dai-Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd. is also planning to take over. In the near future, this Huaxin Yarn Factory will probably be unreliable as well.</p>
<p>Hengyuan: With a capital of 4 million yuan, it originally had 35,440 yarn spindles, 2,540 thread spindles, and 310 looms. Due to business losses, it had debts of more than one million yuan and declared bankruptcy in 1934. At that time, it was rumored that the Japanese Oriental Development Company would take over, but fortunately, that did not become a reality. It is now managed by the Chengfu Trust Company, jointly formed by the China, Central, Jin, and Cheng Salt Industries Banks. They plan to add more than 20,000 yarn spindles and 400 looms, with a planned daily output of more than 100 bales of yarn and 1,400 bolts of cloth. However, we still cannot be fully optimistic about its future. Under the heavy pressure from the Japanese side, it is very difficult to guarantee that it will not follow the path of the aforementioned factories.</p>
<p>Dasheng: Established in 1932, it initially only twisted thread. It only started spinning yarn last year. With a capital of 200,000 yuan, it has a total of 5,000 yarn spindles and 400 workers, with a monthly output of about 300 bales of yarn. Because the factory is small, many people do not pay attention to it. However, due to its recent establishment, all the machines used are new, and the production efficiency is high, and the production cost is relatively low, so it seems to have the hope of development. However, the Japanese side probably won't show much mercy to this rising star. In such an abnormal situation in North China, we still have to harbor infinite worries.</p>
<p>Looking at the above six yarn factories, Dasheng is newly established, and the only remaining old factory is Hengyuan, which is operated by a consortium. Yuyuan, Beiyang (?), and Baocheng have been acquired by Japanese capital, and Huaxin is also in danger. If we include Yuda (with a capital of 3 million yuan, 35,712 yarn spindles, and 1,500 thread spindles), which is already in the hands of Japanese merchants, the vast majority of the power of the Tianjin textile industry is actually held by the Japanese side. Here, we can make another simple comparison:</p>
<p>According to the above table, the Japanese side will account for:</p>
<p>81.2% of the capital of Tianjin's yarn factories, while the Chinese side will account for 18.8%. The Japanese side will account for 82.3% of the yarn spindles, while the Chinese side will account for 17.7%. The Japanese side will account for 73.7% of the thread spindles, while the Chinese side will account for 26.3%. These proportions are already alarming enough, but it doesn't stop there. Japanese merchants are also actively expanding the above-mentioned factories. Yuda Yarn Factory, with the support of Dai-Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd., plans to expand to 50,000 spindles. Yuyuan Yarn Factory, with the support of Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd., plans to expand to 150,000 spindles. In addition, Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. is also building a Yufeng branch factory in Tianjin, with a planned 100,000 yarn spindles. Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd. has recently held a groundbreaking ceremony for a new yarn factory, which can be completed by the end of this year, with 150,000 yarn spindles in the future. At the same time, Dai-Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd., Kanebo Spinning Co., Ltd., and Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd. plan to adopt a production cooperation system to jointly build a large factory that can accommodate 150,000 yarn spindles. Also, there is news that Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd., Osaka Spinning Co., Ltd., and Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. are also jointly establishing a new factory. The first step is to install 50,000 yarn spindles, and the second step is to complete 100,000 yarn spindles next year. It is reported that Japanese merchants have unanimously decided to add at least 600,000 yarn spindles in Tianjin. Then, adding the 200,000 or so spindles in the above table, Tianjin alone will reach a massive 800,000 spindles. The Japanese ambition to control the North China textile market can be said to have been completely achieved.</p>
<p>In addition to Qingdao and Tianjin, it is naturally very difficult for Chinese-owned yarn factories in North China to gain a foothold elsewhere. For example, the Tangshan branch of Huaxin, with 28,000 yarn spindles, is virtually on its last legs under the various devastation and double taxation burdens of the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei. As for the other factories in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, they are also struggling under severe oppression and are in imminent danger. And it's not just North China that's like this, the entire domestic textile industry is facing a total collapse. In addition, smuggling is rampant, and large quantities of cotton cloth flood into various regions, making the livelihood of the weaving industry even more fatally devastated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese side is using all means to monopolize raw cotton. Under the slogan of "Industrial Japan, Agricultural China," North China's cotton production will be completely plundered. The cotton field area in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces accounts for 33% of the total cotton field area in the country, and the production volume accounts for 35% of the total production volume in the country, with an average annual output of about 5 million dan. Furthermore, under the entire invasion program of the Japanese government and the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the "North China Cotton Five-Year Plan" centered on Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. and Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd., they plan to more actively expand cotton fields in North China, improve seeds, first focusing on Eastern Hebei and Eastern Shandong, then Shanxi, and even extending to Shaanxi and Henan provinces. They are determined to make North China an unlimited supply base of raw cotton for the Japanese textile industry, and the farmers of North China will be cotton-planting slaves for life, so that the cotton used by Japanese factories will no longer depend on imports from the United States, India, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only the production and sales of yarn and cloth are monopolized by the Japanese side, but also the supply of raw cotton is unreasonably controlled. From now on, everything in the cotton textile industry will be manipulated by Japanese capital, and China's only national industry will face the danger of premature death!</p>
<p>According to Rong Zongjing, due to the impact of the dumping of products from Japanese mills, Chinese merchants are currently losing 70-80 cents per bale of yarn produced and 30 yuan per piece of cloth. If timely rescue measures are not taken, in the future, it may not even be possible to lose money! So, how to save the industry? We have also heard that the government is providing relief and the banking sector is providing assistance, but so far, these are still castles in the air. According to the Zhonghua Daily on the 10th of this month, a reporter asked Rong Zongjing about the yarn factories' petition to the Ministry of Industry for assistance, and Rong's reply was: "This has been chanted for three years, but nothing has been done in reality!" What a painful sigh! In addition, in early May, we saw the leaders of the Bank of China jointly form the Textile Industry Management Association to rescue the North China textile industry, and held a meeting in Zhengzhou to discuss the methods for purchasing cotton, spinning yarn, and selling prices. At that time, it seemed to show a glimmer of dawn for the North China textile industry. However, more than two months have passed, and we have not heard of any specific follow-up!</p>
<p>Originally, the decline of China's cotton textile industry is definitely not a simple issue of so-called "market depression." It is the inevitable result of political and economic aggression by certain parties. Therefore, even if the above-mentioned "rescue" is done well, it will only be a temporary fix and not a thorough solution. We must remember the gunpowder smell contained in "economic cooperation" and "industrial ×× agricultural China." How to get China out of the shackles of a colony or semi-colony is our fundamental way out!</p>
<h3>The Smuggling Problem</h3>
<p>— Wang Haifan</p>
<p>The issue of smuggling in our country has existed for a long time. Anyone who understands the commercial situation in Shanghai and has a certain understanding of its inner workings knows that there are so-called "white goods" and "red goods" in rayon and cigarette paper. These terms are euphemisms for official goods and smuggled goods. Although the annual loss of customs duties cannot be statistically determined, it is probably considerable. However, it is reported that there are also considerable organizations among these people, with tea parties and market prices. For smuggled goods from certain sources, some only send the goods to the port, some guarantee landing, and some act as agents for transshipment, guaranteeing all risks and sending them to the sales venues of these people. All of these involve collaboration between Chinese traitors and Japanese ruffians, relying on the protection of foreign forces to cover the ears and eyes of customs officials. Once the smuggled goods land and reach the sales agencies, there is no risk of being caught, even when transshipped inland. The "passes" for paying taxes can be substituted and used fraudulently, so that "white goods" are no different from "red goods." This is a general overview of smuggling in the past. As for whether the facts are really like this, it is certainly not something that outsiders can know. And now with the rampant smuggling in North China, penetrating deep into the interior, some believe that it is caused by excessive customs duties. Such as Ross's remarks upon returning home, advocating for reducing tax rates, but what they do not know is that our country's tax rates, on the whole, are still lower than those of countries like England, America, Germany, France, and Japan. We know that a country's import tariffs, without violating the most-favored-nation clause, have the right to be freely determined. Even if the tax rate is high, Japanese merchants should abide by the provisions of the treaty and comply with China's customs regulations. They cannot use this as an excuse to implement smuggling and tax evasion, acting recklessly without restraint. Moreover, according to recent customs investigations, smuggled goods are not limited to expensive and heavily taxed items such as rayon. Various fruits and seafood are also frequently smuggled. If that is the case, then the promotion of smuggling is definitely not due to excessive tax rates.</p>
<p>So, where does the main cause lie? First, it is due to the urgent need for Japanese goods to find a way out. Since the occupation of the four northeastern provinces, industry has flourished. Last year, due to the expansion of occupied territories and the special opportunity of the Italo-Ethiopian War, foreign trade achieved a new record. This year, since January, the total amount of import surplus in the first quarter reached more than 215 million yuan, an increase of more than 53 million yuan compared to the same period last year. However, exports have ultimately failed to increase in tandem. Proportionally, the export amount increased by 4% compared to the same period last year, while the import amount increased by 9% compared to the same period last year. Under this situation, the Japanese had no choice but to urgently seek market expansion. However, looking around, countries are panicking all day long, all regarding 1936 as an extraordinary period, loudly advocating self-sufficiency policies, and gradually moving towards wartime controlled economies. Free trade is not easy to achieve today. And how can the dream of the Far East Economic Bloc be realized? Therefore, in order to achieve its goals, it does not hesitate to allow and tolerate smuggling.</p>
<p>Secondly, disrupting finance is originally one of the policies of the aggressor. The smuggling problem is almost as the London Times said on May 18th, "This matter is not just a local action by Japanese soldiers..." This is evidenced by the seizure of privately transported silver coins in North China from January to May of last year. At this time, maritime smuggling had not yet expanded. Why did the Japanese side make a request that our country's customs anti-smuggling ships could not perform their duties in the war zone? Why were the anti-smuggling personnel along the Great Wall at the same time disarmed? Allowing illegal elements to become increasingly rampant. Moreover, after our side repeatedly requested assistance, why did they shirk responsibility and simply ignore it? Subsequently, our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest, but why has there been no result to this day? Furthermore, countries like England and America, based on their own interests, have all formally questioned the Japanese government, but why have they not been able to get to the bottom of it? From this perspective, the situation is obvious. Although they want to destroy our finances and shake our markets, their long-term plans are not new. Before and after our country implemented legal tender last year, they first thought of using huge amounts of paper money to create a terrifying run on the banks. Later, Japanese merchants in Shanghai proposed using Japanese currency in the Chinese market to carry out their conspiracy of disruption. Although the matter has not been put into practice, if their plan had succeeded, the disaster would have been even greater than smuggling. Moreover, today's smuggling is no longer comparable to the previous petty theft and tax evasion. On the sea, ships follow each other, fully loaded. On land, they drive out guests and load goods, obstructing railway traffic. Those in charge of these activities have large-scale trade associations and other ruffian organizations. Without a background, how could they be so rampant?</p>
<p>Contemporary scholars discussing the prevention of smuggling and tax evasion advocate for encouraging informants and strictly cracking down on smuggling. However, the government's current punitive regulations for tax evasion state that those evading more than one thousand yuan must face life imprisonment, and in severe cases, the death penalty. The prohibitions are not insignificant. For reward methods, for anyone who provides information and leads to an arrest and punishment, there is a reward of 50%. The incentives are not ungenerous. However, smuggled goods continue to pour in, rampaging through the market, with a strong and uncurbed momentum. Anti-smuggling efforts encounter obstruction, leading to assault and insult, which is heard every day. Today, the situation has become increasingly deteriorated. As a result, national tax revenues are shrinking day by day, and industry and commerce are in imminent danger. What measures do we have to deal with this serious problem? Encouraging informants and strictly cracking down on smuggling, in today's environment, can they be effective? As for seeking Japanese understanding and assistance, it is impossible. As for whether the tax rate should be revised, we already know that it is definitely not the reason for smuggling. Sir Ross's words are well-intentioned, but our government should have its own opinions. We fear that if we follow his words, smuggling will not stop, and the country's losses will be even greater. For the current plan, in the active aspect, other than using strength to adjust the special status of North China in order to achieve a thorough success, there is no other good strategy. In the passive aspect, merchants should feel the pain personally, strictly strengthen their own organizations, report smuggled goods, and sanction Chinese traitors, so that once the way out for smuggled goods is cut off, the way in will naturally be blocked. The former is initiated by the government, with the people as the backing. The latter is initiated by the people, with the government as the backing. If this is the case, it may be possible to achieve effectiveness in the slightest chance. If we continue to act perfunctorily and do not devise effective countermeasures, simply seeking to open up new sources of revenue due to insufficient tax revenue, then people will covet private gain, and there will be no end to it. In that case, the disasters that follow may be worse than floods and wild beasts.</p>
<h3>Deliberations on Domestic Product Inspection</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>—Regarding the issue of "People's Automatic Handling"—</p>
<p>In the past, we have had many painful experiences, where originally well-intentioned improvement endeavors often yielded the opposite results. The recent implementation of domestic product inspection by the Ministry of Industry is at such a crossroads.</p>
<p>The original intention of domestic product inspection is not only a type of agricultural improvement endeavor, but also a matter of utmost urgency today. The main focus of domestic product inspection is place-of-origin inspection. In China today, where industry is not yet highly developed and agriculture still occupies an important position in the national economy, the so-called domestic products are naturally mainly agricultural products. Therefore, domestic product inspection, in a narrow sense, can also be called place-of-origin inspection of agricultural products. The reasons for agricultural products to undergo place-of-origin inspection are very clear: First, the quality of various agricultural products in China today is too mixed, and inspection can passively promote improvement in production; second, guaranteeing excellent quality and identifying quality grades helps with the conduct of sales; third, cracking down on the bad habits of adulteration and counterfeiting enhances the reputation of products. The agricultural production relations in China today are extremely complex. The reasonable implementation of domestic product inspection, in addition to striving to improve the quality of agricultural products, must not only consider the interests of merchants and the people, but also the interests of farmers.</p>
<p>China has had many years of history in the inspection administration of import and export commodities, and domestic product inspection, mainly for domestic sales, is a new initiative. At the beginning of its inception, it is inevitable to refer to the effectiveness of implementation in some advanced countries.</p>
<p>Let us first look at the situation in Japan. The background of Japan's inspection administration: the national territory is not large, and the institutions of various sectors of society are not only organized but also unified. Under such favorable conditions, it seems that inspection work is easy to promote and can be "automatically handled by the people"? However, Japan's inspection administration has also taken great pains.</p>
<p>Japan's inspection work is divided into two types: one is the inspection of industrial products, and the other is the inspection of agricultural products. The inspection of industrial products can be said to be "automatically handled by the people," but it has also undergone important reforms. Japan's industrial product inspection agencies are all "industrial associations" of the respective industries. If we regard these industrial associations as exactly the same in nature as our country's trade associations, then that is completely wrong. It can only be said that they are equivalent to our country's current trade associations, which in Japan are "industry associations." Because the Japanese have strong organizational skills, in some situations, they are much more organized and powerful than our country's current trade associations. Since the global economic panic occurred after 1929 and trade wars intensified among countries, the Japanese government knew that to cope with the current economic war, it was necessary to improve the quality of Japanese goods and reduce costs at the same time. The method used to achieve this goal was the so-called "people's autonomous control." The most suitable agency to implement this "autonomous control" seems to be the industry association. However, the Japanese government still considered the strength of the industry associations to be insufficient and separately promulgated the Industrial Association Law, so that various industries automatically organized industrial associations to carry out: (1) active mutual assistance in production, (2) passive inspection and control (such as prices) two major tasks.</p>
<p>But this is only the situation in the industrial sector, the agricultural sector is completely different. Japan's so-called "autonomous control" (including automatic inspection) is limited to commodity producers themselves, so only industrial products are possible. The direct producers of agricultural products are scattered small farmers (Japan still maintains fragmented small-scale farming). These farmers are still culturally very backward, and it is impossible for them to automatically inspect their own agricultural products. Therefore, the inspection of agricultural products is purely the work of the government.</p>
<p>Agricultural inspection in Japan is part of the work of local governments. Because agricultural production is scattered throughout the country and the situation in each place is different, it is necessary to handle them separately according to the specific circumstances. Therefore, agricultural inspection in Japan varies from prefecture to prefecture, and the types of inspections also differ. People's organizations such as local agricultural associations and "inspection associations" only stand in a supplementary position (for details, see the Japan Agricultural Product Inspection Survey Report published by the Upper Commodity Inspection Bureau).</p>
<p>The inspection of agricultural products in the United States is also the same, all handled by the government. (Same as above, published in the International Trade Guide, Volume 6, Number 9)</p>
<p>After looking at these references, let's look at China's agricultural inspection methods.</p>
<p>At the second meeting on April 24 of this year (1936), the Domestic Product Inspection Committee of the Ministry of Industry resolved on six "Basic Principles of the Domestic Product Inspection System":</p>
<p>1. Start with cracking down on adulteration and counterfeiting, with the aim of identifying grades.</p>
<p>2. First promoted by the government, with the hope that it will gradually be handled automatically by the people, under the supervision and guidance of the government, but the inspection methods and grading standards must be submitted to the Ministry (Ministry of Industry) for approval, and the inspectors must be recognized by the competent inspection agency of the Ministry.</p>
<p>3. Domestic sales inspection of domestic products should start from collection and distribution markets or places of origin.</p>
<p>4. The government will not charge handling fees for domestic sales inspection of domestic products.</p>
<p>5. Samples taken for domestic sales inspection of domestic products will be returned after inspection.</p>
<p>6. Inspection procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and strict time limits for inspection should be set to facilitate commercial transportation.</p>
<p>In terms of these six principles, it cannot be said that considerations are not comprehensive. However, in terms of the second principle, if strict regulations are not given, it is difficult to avoid being the main reason for leading domestic product inspection down a wrong path. The provision in the budget allocation of the resolution: "Those who are self-operated by merchant groups shall raise funds for handling by the respective groups themselves," further leads inspection into a wrong path. Although the detailed rules for the implementation of various domestic product inspections are separately stipulated, these six principles must be generally applicable.</p>
<p>First of all, what we need to study is: What kind of "people" are the so-called people who automatically handle it? According to the words "automatically," it is naturally the operators of various industries, such as the inspection of light bulbs by light bulb manufacturers, and the inspection of cotton cloth by cotton cloth manufacturers. The nature that can be applied to this is naturally limited to the industrial product sector. If agricultural products are also "automatically handled by the people," then only the farmers themselves who are direct producers are qualified.</p>
<p>Let's start with industrial products first. To achieve the goal of people's automatic inspection, the people must first have complete, close-knit, and powerful organizations, and these organizations must be purely automatic by the operators. Such an organization that is sufficient to bear this responsibility does not exist today. The most important organizations of industrialists and merchants in China today are the chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places. The members contained in the chamber of commerce are extremely complex. Only in the past when industry was underdeveloped, the social classes were still three categories: direct producer farmers, seller merchants, and governing government. Only at that time was the chamber of commerce the only people's organization. Now, the interests of the producer industrialists and the purely selling merchants are different, and the work is even more divergent. As seen in Mr. Hu Xiyuan's recent request for the promulgation of the Industrial Association Law, this is a manifestation of this fact. Furthermore, in terms of the internal situation of existing chambers of commerce, most cannot be said to be powerful, nor can they be said to be well-organized, resulting in things such as bribery, embezzlement, and flight of executive members. In addition, fundamentally, the chamber of commerce does not see "operators," so there is no "automatic handling" to speak of.</p>
<p>The trade association is more suitable for the condition of being an organization of operators. However, the trade associations in China today cannot bear this responsibility either: First, in many trade industries today, most are not organizations of industrial producers, but organizations of sales merchants. They naturally cannot talk about "automatic handling." If they can "automatically handle it," then what is "passively" handled is not their own products, but other people's. The result is that they overstep their authority to interfere with others, and the function of "automatic" is completely lost. Second, even if there are some organizations of industrial producers, these trade associations still cannot get rid of the remnants of the past industrial guilds, or are even simply something like a club. For example, recently, when smuggling became rampant, all parties attached importance to the trade association playing a role. As a result, Mr. Ma Yinchu and others came to the conclusion of reorganizing and strengthening the trade association.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of industrial products, automatic inspection by the people is possible, but there must first be an organization that can bear this responsibility, and the government can absolutely control this organization. Before Japan announced the Industrial Association, the strength and organization of all industry associations were probably much higher than those existing in China, but the Japanese government thought it was not enough and re-promulgated the Industrial Association Law, giving the power of automatic inspection of industrial products to the industrial associations of various industries.</p>
<p>We know that the problem of domestic product inspection in China does not lie in industrial products, but in agricultural products. The main body of domestic product inspection is actually only agricultural product inspection. If agricultural product inspection is to apply the second of the "basic principles," then only the farmers themselves, who are direct producers, are qualified. But we clearly know that the scattered individual small farmers themselves will not have the strength to "automatically handle" it. If they can automatically handle it, then in the place of origin, there must be local tyrants and evil gentry, under the guise of farmers, establishing groups and contracting inspections. In the "collection and distribution center," there must be commercial capitalists, presuming to be "operators," "automatically" inspecting for farmers. In this way, the government originally intended to avoid establishing more agencies, but as a result, the gentry and merchants have established more agencies for the government. Not only can this not achieve the government's original intention, but the severity of the disaster is unimaginable. Because anyone can use the second "basic principle" as an excuse to organize groups as much as possible to inspect for farmers, and can use the proposal of "raising funds on their own" as a talisman to increase the exploitation of farmers.</p>
<p>This is not alarmist. Soon after the resolution of the Domestic Product Inspection Committee was announced, the wealthy gentry and market hooligans had already risen up in droves, organizing groups to "help" the government.</p>
<p>Agricultural inspection handled by the people has no precedents to follow in various countries. In terms of China's actual situation, malpractices will inevitably arise. Why? As mentioned earlier, since farmers cannot "automatically" handle it, and merchants handle it, the effect of "automatic" by the operators has already been lost. Moreover, in terms of the actual situation in Chinese rural areas, merchants often stand in a position contrary to the interests of farmers. Most of the adulteration and fraud in various agricultural products are also done by intermediate selling merchants. If merchants who are sellers inspect agricultural products, no matter how strong the government's supervision is, it will be of no benefit to farmers.</p>
<p>We believe that "people's automatic handling" of agricultural product inspection is not yet the time! If the government is determined to make the inspection work be done by the people automatically, then not only must organizational work be done in advance, but the government's control power must also be specially strengthened. Otherwise, if the power of inspection falls into the hands of rural wealthy gentry and market hooligans, then it will inevitably be "the original intention was a very good improvement undertaking, but the results obtained are often the opposite."</p>
<h3>Wheat Inspection Methods</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Wheat is a major staple food of our people. In recent years, due to frequent disasters and the increase in population, it has become insufficient. The amount of foreign wheat imported last year almost ranked first among imports. In this intersection of people's livelihood and economic distress, how to increase production to enrich the domestic food supply, how to diligently implement controls to balance the surpluses and deficits of food in various places. And the implementation of inspection undertakings, in a passive aspect, can prevent adulteration and counterfeiting and reduce losses; in an active aspect, can improve quality and facilitate transportation, sales and storage. It can directly increase the interests of producers, sellers and consumers, and indirectly can help the rural areas. Revitalize and develop various industries to stabilize the national life. Therefore, various countries regard food inspection as an important government affair, and there is a good reason for this.</p>
<p>The importance of wheat inspection has been described earlier. However, this kind of undertaking is still a new initiative in our country. What kind of policy should be adopted, and what should be the steps? This is indeed a prerequisite for the implementation of inspection. In order to facilitate promotion and achieve great results, it is especially important to consider carefully. Now, after summing up the opinions of all parties. All believe that the steps of wheat inspection should start with cracking down on the mixing of water and adulteration, followed by grade, and then quality. I do not know that in terms of China's actual situation, the crackdown on wheat should start with simple grading.</p>
<p>The purpose of inspection undertakings is (1) to improve the grade of products, (2) to guarantee and unify the quality and quantity of products, (3) to improve the method of buying and selling, (4) to rationalize storage or preservation. It is a comprehensive body of grain improvement facilities, inspection facilities and treatment improvement facilities. Each facility has an inseparable and rapid lock relationship, and must be harmonized with each other to exert its function. And just to improve the grade of products, it can be divided into three types: quality improvement, drying improvement, and preparation improvement, which are also related. At present, various facilities in our country are not perfect. Large-scale preparation and drying equipment still need to be promoted and promoted. Farmers and merchants also lack a considerable understanding of inspection policies and need publicity. In this transition period, if strict crackdown regulations are to be established and enforced, there will inevitably be many obstacles in fact, which goes without saying. For example, if a large batch of wheat is inspected as unqualified during transportation, at this time it is not allowed to be bought and sold, and there is no preparation and drying equipment to make it re-improve the product, how will it be dealt with? If you want to implement according to the regulations, it is inevitably too harsh. If you change the handling, you violate the original intention. Therefore, it is not easy to implement the crackdown for a while, and you should seek another way. Before implementing the crackdown, you can adopt a laissez-faire policy and conduct simple grading inspections in the wheat collection and distribution market. The main purpose of this inspection is to only grade without cracking down. It can avoid the difficulties caused by the crackdown methods, and graded wheat can be priced according to grade in the market trade, which still implies the intention of rewarding the superior and depreciating the inferior. Farmers and merchants know that wheat that has undergone grading inspection can get a considerable price, and they can gradually be influenced and understand the need for inspection. Then, when strict crackdown regulations are formulated and promoted, various difficulties can be solved easily. This is why cracking down on the mixing of water and adulteration of wheat should start with simple grading.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Fluctuations in the American Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton showed fluctuations in each month from two to four points, with active but unstable trading. Although the news from Liverpool was good, the market price was sluggish due to the profit-taking of bulls, sales from the Far East, and hedging by cotton farmers. Later, Liverpool, Mainland, peers, and brokers bought in, and there was a slight rebound. Unfortunately, mass selling, cotton farmer hedging, beneficial rain in the East and Midwest, and the weakness of the wheat market caused prices to fall again. The closing was flat and tired. The spot price fell by eleven points, and the futures price fell by eight to fourteen points. Spot cotton is firm, and factories have no intention of purchasing. The supply and demand of textiles were equal within the week. The spot price of British cotton fell by seven points, and the futures price did not move. Indian cotton saw profit-taking by bulls and large-scale selling by exchangers. Japanese and European exporters bought in, and speculators also made purchases. The Pingguole fell by 0.25 to 2.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.25 to 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated 18th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton for the April-May period on the 20th was 210 rupees, a decrease of 1.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Grain: River Rice Arrives Sparsely, Market Steady</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were even scarcer, only arriving at numbers six or seven, a total of one thousand four hundred and five hundred dan. Therefore, although the sales market in this street is still flat, the Dalian Qingdao gangs only handled two to three hundred bags, but people's hearts are quite stable. The prices of thick and thin rice have risen by a few points again. However, judging from the overall trend, it is feared that once the source arrives vigorously, it will still be difficult to be optimistic. The routes for Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan are extremely agitated, and the price is stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs in Hexia were numbered fifteen or sixteen. The routes for various goods on the market, Baigeng, were slightly destocked when fresh, and the middle and lower grades were slightly active. The market price of high-quality goods is stable, and the middle and lower grades have turned slightly tight. Thin rice is peaceful, and the movement of Bianyuan in small quantities is slightly active, with the price increased by three or four points. Yangjian high-quality goods are tired and stable, and the middle and lower grades are showing signs of fatigue again. The destocking of port guest tips is still sluggish, and the price is barely standing. The prices of other goods are stable. Sugar Market: The inventory of sugar in this city has decreased significantly.</p>

<h3>Summer in West Lake</h3>
<p>— (Yao Mingran)</p>
<p>Everyone knows the beauty of the mountains and waters of West Lake. And the summer West Lake is an even more worthy place to sing praises! From Su Dongpo's poem about West Lake in June: "After all, West Lake in the sixth month is different from the scenery of the four seasons; the lotus leaves connecting to the sky are infinitely green, and the lotus flowers reflecting the sun are especially red"! That's enough to make you yearn for it! Remember Zeng Ziguzi's Cooling Poem at West Lake: "Ask me where to escape the heat? Ten acres of West Lake illuminate my eyes, fish playing with a pole fill the new waves, birds chirping and a thousand trees turn green into shade, the waist of the rainbow faintly appears from the pine bridge, the prow of the boat is towering, the painted boat is sailing, I like the cool evening breeze and the moon is good, and the sound of the flying spring in the fragrance of purple lotus," the old people's secluded appreciation record also said: "Su Causeway to see the new green, Three Lives Stone to talk about the moon, Feilai Pavilion to escape the heat, pressing the embankment bridge to spend the night, the Lake Heart Pavilion to pick water shields" are all glorious histories of the summer West Lake, it can be seen that the summer West Lake does not emphasize the mountains and water, but the lake scenery of lotus flowers and painted boats.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Period—Summer</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Summer is the most dangerous season of the year, because in summer, the activity of all terrible germs is often the highest of the year. Recently, people like to say an "extraordinary period" for everything. From a sanitary point of view, "summer" should also be considered an extraordinary period of the year.</p>
<p>During extraordinary periods, everyone is careful about air defense. In our summer life, I feel that "air defense issues" are also very important. Our air enemy is the fly. Each fly is like an airplane that releases poison gas, spreading cholera germs, typhoid germs, dysentery germs, etc., and causing people to die. The most effective method for enemy aircraft is to shoot down one when it comes, and shoot down two when two come. For flies, naturally, kill one when it comes, and kill two when two come. The passive method is naturally to imitate the method of air defense, covering the food with a gauze cover so that the flies cannot come into contact with the food. But the fundamental way, then I think, should be "national defense first" as a motto, to make the room clean, and flies avoid it far away. During extraordinary periods, in addition to air defense, the drinking water problem is also very important, because in the tense atmosphere, there is always a danger of enemies placing poison in the waterways. In this extraordinary period of our year, even if you drink a sip of plain water, you always have to drink it boiled to avoid the danger of enemy germs. The water in the inland rivers cannot be drunk without boiling it. Even the tap water in the city, which looks very clean, is questionable whether it is bacteria-free after passing through long water pipes. Even if the tap water is 100% clean, it is difficult to guarantee that the bacteria attached to the drinking utensils will not invade the human body with it once it is released. So even if it is tap water, it is safe to drink it boiled to avoid poisoning. Mosquitoes, as everyone knows, are the medium for transmitting infectious germs. Although they are not as terrible as flies that spread germs, their sneaky expression is quite similar to the needle attack that was all the rage in Sichuan some time ago. It is also a major enemy in the extraordinary period, and it is urgent to find a way to eliminate it. In addition, things like bedbugs and cockroaches are somewhat like spies who are disrupting the rear. If they are not strictly searched and arrested, it may also affect the entire situation.</p>
<h3>Summer Morning</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>When my classmates write about summer, they always like to write about summer nights. Indeed, in the summer night, it is true that there are many mysterious and heavy atmospheres, which are worthy of the infatuation of homeless wanderers, and worthy of the praise, or sigh, curse, or satire of optimistic, or pessimistic poets, artists, painters, and other emotional people. But I feel that there is a special taste in the summer morning.</p>
<p>Although all the wine houses and dance halls have turned off the charming red lights at two o'clock the night before, when the sun has just climbed up from the horizon with a shining top, the 1936-style streamlined cars, when entering the city from the suburbs, are all carrying pairs of men and women, young gentlemen, and modern girls. The young gentlemen's hair has escaped the control of Tai Liang Si Taikang, and it is messily covering their foreheads. The modern girls have also faded the rouge on their cheeks and the lipstick on their lips. The dullness in their eyes shows the fatigue of the whole night, yearning for the joy of nightlife in the sea, suburbs, or parks, they have forgotten all the summer depression.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk, on the narrow and dirty sidewalk, people are lying like sleepers, arranged in rows. They are all seeking a life in the city of material civilization, but they have not enjoyed the blessings of modern material civilization. They curse the cruelty of urban life, but they do not have the courage to escape this city. They are oppressed by mosquitoes and bedbugs in the house and cannot get the rest to recover from the fatigue of the day. At the same time, they are steamed by the stagnant air in the house and feel difficulty in breathing. So they have to sit on the ground and seek a sweet dream life. But the ruthless dung truck, turning the heavy iron wheels, awakens the good dreams of some people, and the little smile on anyone's face is driven away. That's right, it's time for another day of hard work to begin.</p>
<p>But, outside of these two scenes, in another area of the same city, there are large, square, three-dimensional foreign houses, surrounded by flowers and trees. The golden sun kisses the green treetops, showing the grace and luxury of the summer morning. In the quiet air, on the lawn surrounded by wire mesh, the sound of a tennis ball occasionally comes out. Through the gaps in the wire mesh, a scene of a noble Westerner hitting a tennis ball is displayed. At the same time, on another lawn, several Chinese amahs are leading a group of Western children, playing and jumping. Although they also live in this city, their lives seem to be in another world.</p>
<h3>Looking at the Melon Patch</h3>
<p>— Jin Sulan</p>
<p>The wheels of time keep turning, and it's summer. The weather is unusually hot, and watermelons, that wonderful product for cooling off, are ripening one after another.</p>
<p>Chen Quanfu planted four acres of watermelon fields, a lush green expanse where watermelons of various sizes lie quietly under the dense foliage.</p>
<p>When the watermelons are almost ripe, they need careful protection. Chen Quanfu used several reed mats to build a low shed at the edge of the field, laying a tattered straw mat inside. He spends his entire day hiding in it, guarding the watermelons.</p>
<p>He carries a dry tobacco pipe and a sharp fish spear with him. When he is bored and lonely, he smokes a few pipes of dry tobacco, which is enough to break the silence and invigorate his spirit.</p>
<p>He is like a high monk in deep meditation, sitting cross-legged in the small shed, closing his eyes to rest. He seems to be asleep, but his hearing is still very sharp, fulfilling his duty. Occasionally, if he hears a dog barking or the footsteps of a passerby from the road, he wakes up as if shocked by electricity. He pokes his head out of the shed to look around. Seeing no movement and that his watermelons are safe and sound, he retreats back into the shed.</p>
<p>At night, he is deeply afraid that bad people will come to steal watermelons, so he dares not fall asleep all night. He perks up his spirit, watching the field with wide eyes and listening attentively. When he is so tired that he keeps yawning, he lights his dry tobacco pipe and smokes it desperately to refresh himself. He smokes with such force that the white copper pipe emits a creaking groan.</p>
<p>The field is quiet, and everything seems to be fast asleep. Small sheds, like mounds of earth, are scattered like stars. The guards are all on alert, so even if thieves are bold, they would not dare to use their tricks.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rustling sound comes from the field, which is a hedgehog gnawing at the watermelon. Chen Quanfu hates these detestable creatures. He immediately grabs his fish spear and rushes out, but the vigilant hedgehog has already run far away.</p>
<p>Chen Quanfu feels extremely hot and stuffy in the shed, but he hopes that the weather will be hotter than 100 degrees, so that the price of watermelons will become increasingly expensive. Then he can earn a lot of money, enough for his family to live on for half a year.</p>
<h3>Phoenixes Replacing Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Sight and Sound are but Fleeting Illusions, Doubts Arise with Every Letter; Life and Death can be Entrusted to Generous and Singular Laments</p>
<p>Guoqi understood and translated according to the instructions. He found lesson fifteen, but it was not about patriotic children; the title was Yue Fei. He pressed down on the book, looked at the students, and said, "You say it's about patriotic children, but this is Yue Fei." A larger student turned the page, stood up, held it up for him to see, and smiled, "Teacher, look, aren't all the children in this book patriotic? The book you're holding is history, not language." Guoqi was reminded by these words. He turned the book cover over to take a look, and indeed it was a history book! He couldn't help but chuckle. He tried his best to calm himself down and clear his mind, and then he finished teaching the two-hour lesson. Originally, he could go home for lunch at this time, but he looked at his watch and realized it was still an hour before Menglan's school dismissal time. So he slowly walked to the courtyard, looked up at the sky, and walked two circles around the campus. He looked at his watch again, and only ten minutes had passed. A thought flashed through his mind that it was very difficult to pass the time like this, so he went to the reading room and read all the major newspapers from Shanghai from beginning to end, twice. He happened to find a very strange travelogue of Xikang in the newspaper, so he suppressed his impatience and finished reading it. After reading the whole article, he remembered that he had important matters to attend to. He put down the newspaper, looked at his watch, and walked out of the school. Fortunately, he had already walked into the deep alley and was about five or six minutes early according to the agreed time. Generally speaking, this couldn't be considered late. But the empty alley was silent, and there was no sign of anyone. He wondered, "Did she not come? Did she pass by?" He stood in the middle of the alley, staring left and right. Then he looked up into the heads of people? Because the face of someone was sticking out. (49)</p>
<h3>Various Roses</h3>
<p>— Yan Bokuang</p>
<p>On the hills, thorny roses are planted everywhere, blooming with delicate flowers. The rich, sweet fragrance is blown into people's nostrils by the gentle breeze. How delightful! Among flowers, roses are considered to have it all: "color, fragrance, and taste."</p>
<p>Rose flowers: Pick roses from the branches, dry them over charcoal fire, and store them in lime jars. When serving tea to guests, put two roses on top. The fragrance can stay in the mouth and cheeks. Roses have "color, fragrance, and taste." Everyone says so.</p>
<p>During the rose season, Suzhou candy stores sell very good rose jam. But when I was working in Suzhou, I asked a Suzhou person what food goes best with rose jam. According to him, it's best to eat it with white zongzi. The red and white colors complement each other, making it beautiful and delicious.</p>
<p>Rose flower wine is also very good. Rose dew is made by collecting roses, putting them in a distillation pot, and applying heat to turn them into flower dew. It's a wonderful drink to quench thirst in the hot summer.</p>
<p>Roses have many uses. After baking and drying them, they can be crushed into powder and mixed into various pastries, which are very popular.</p>

<h3>Suffering from the Heat</h3>
<p>— Chen Cidi</p>
<p>It's difficult to wake anything, the clouds at the edge of the sky don't move. The soil is dry, with traces of the drought; people are quiet, the birds fly slowly. The moonlight is warm in the wind, the starlight hangs low by the doors. The body seems to have entered the summer heat; one awaits the autumn season during the summer solstice.</p>
<h3>Summer Day in Butterfly Villa</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaocui</p>
<p>On a sunny day, the lake corridor reflects the water patterns, the plum rain is damp, filling the air with incense. Gauze curtains are fragrant with mist all day long; one knows it is mosquito smoke that looks like white clouds.</p>
<p>The old house in the south is shaded by green trees, the mountain spirits and poets live together as a family (many houses surround the main building). Wet fireflies fly erratically on the ground; in the depths of the night, cool rain dreams of lotus flowers.</p>
<p>A few thatched cottages at the head of eighteen shoals; people sit by the wooden planks to enjoy the cool air. Green mountains surround all sides, making one wonder if there is no road; a firefly flies up to the sky like a star.</p>
<p>My worthy brother's ancient style poem resembles Su Dongpo's untrimmed beard, its spirit soaring like clouds, spreading forth freely. Gazing into the distance, the mountains are purely like ink; I know you must have a great thunderous book. (Sending my regards to my elder brother Dieye)</p>
<p>Shu Zhenyuan heard that Xia Yue'an and Huang Muhan founded the Cambridge Painting Society, which has been around for ten years. Its purpose is to promote the highest Chinese art, restoring the natural realm of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, and washing away the conventions of the Four Wangs of the modern era. They once said that Western painting schools excel at realism, and their realms are naturally superior, but they lack the essence of brushwork, almost like photography. Chinese painting emphasizes the essence of brushwork, but is limited by imitation and lacks new realms. One must break ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, and combine imagery and brushwork into one to be considered truly talented. Yue'an's Landscape Collection has been printed into two volumes, and Huangshan's volume, which is also a great work, will be published soon. Yue'an is skilled in the prose of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties. His collection of Yue'an's writings has long been popular, and his scrolls will soon be printed and published.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Municipal Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Summer is, as usual, a season for "mermaids" to be active. So these days, in every swimming pool, we can enjoy the acrobatics of those "mermaids" leaping and splashing in the waves. Especially those "beautiful mermaids," their beautiful curves and lively postures give us the temptation and courage to try.</p>
<p>Shanghai has no shortage of swimming pools. There are the Hongkou Swimming Pool and the Sports Garden Swimming Pool nearby. Further away, there is the Gaoqiao Seaside Swimming Beach. There are also several semi-public ones such as the YMCA and the Liangjiang Southeast East Asia. But since the opening of the Municipal Swimming Pool in the city center, swimming enthusiasts have had another paradise for fitness and cooling off in the summer.</p>
<p>Although I am not good at swimming, I still like it, so I often like to stroll around in several swimming pools. However, since the Municipal Swimming Pool was completed, I only went once during the National Games to visit Yang Xiuqiong, and I haven't had the chance to go again since then. Now that it is open, I naturally have to find a way to visit it.</p>
<p>On a day when the sun was burning like fire, I wanted to escape the sweltering heat of ninety-seven or ninety-eight degrees, so I took a streamlined motorcycle with Jun and climbed onto the smooth Qimei Road, speeding towards the city center. In less than twenty minutes, we got out of the car in a large open space. Looking up, we saw the majestic and magnificent swimming pool, with its two iron gates open, standing there smiling like a dignified gentleman, greeting us politely.</p>
<p>Jun went to the women's changing room to change, as usual, and I walked into the men's changing room on the right. When the two of us came out of the glass doors on both sides, there were already many male and female "mermaids" in and around the swimming pool who were there before us.</p>
<p>In the rectangular swimming pool, which was fifty meters long, the water was flat and still, as green as a piece of jade. When a woman swims on the water, she looks like a beautiful goldfish, further enhanced by the slight ripples of the green waves, making her naturally feel extraordinarily moving and lovely. Moreover, there are also many vaguely protruding peaks hidden in the swimsuits, and trembling fleshy legs, which can make people intoxicated. Jun first dived into the water from the springboard, put her head on the surface of the water, and waved at me with her hand. I stood on the side and looked around, then patted my chest and jumped into the pool. Immersed in the water, I felt infinitely cool and comfortable, and my spirit was much more cheerful. Jun and I kicked our feet in the shallow water and swam as hard as we could towards the deep end of the pool. The two of us had a temporary race, and as a result, Jun's skills were much better than mine, so I ended up falling behind by more than a foot.</p>
<p>Here, there are absolutely no gender boundaries. Everyone is half-naked, and there are no classes. You can swim and play to your heart's content. Some people swim arm in arm in the water, while others whisper side by side by the pool, forgetting reality, forgetting ugliness. Only this moment is their time in a paradise of happiness.</p>
<p>There are several women who cannot swim. Although they are wearing fashionable swimsuits, they only play in the shallow water, stepping on the water, or being taught by male companions, giggling and laughing, showing off their romantic and ridiculous abilities to the fullest. At this moment, no one thinks about the economic depression of the world or the terror of the eve of war. Everyone wants to enjoy this moment of numbness and stimulation as much as possible!</p>
<p>The sound of water splashing, the sound of laughter, the sound of whistling, the sound of singing, all blended together around the pool. Swimming, watching, listening, whispering, you will never feel the fatigue of your limbs. Ah! That endless revelry!</p>
<p>It was already dusk, so we changed back into our clothes and followed everyone out of the gate of the swimming pool.</p>

<h3>Precautions for Taking Pigment Agents for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Doctor Dai De</p>
<p>Since the internal use of gonorrhea preparations, which adopted the local "membrane penetration sterilization" method, was declared a failure, the application of pigments has been widely provided in the treatment field for the purpose of anti-inflammatory and sterilization. It has been called for by patients. Its therapeutic value has exceeded that of the old gonorrhea drugs. However, although its efficacy is great, its side effects are also strong. Fierce drugs inevitably have evil effects of violence. Moreover, pigments have always been used only for injections, and have never been used internally. If taken improperly, it can damage the stomach and intestines in mild cases, and lead to life-threatening danger in severe cases. I used to use pigment injections for a large number of patients, and nineteen out of ten had side effects such as vomiting and pale faces. Later, I read European medical journals and learned that pigments have recently been extracted and purified by Ehrlich's scientific methods. Dr. Burolinggu even tested it on domestic rabbits and guinea pigs, proving that it had no adverse irritation. Therefore, Dr. Peter further used electrification to create the drug "Clinon."</p>
<p>Pigments are available in various countries, but they have many drawbacks, and their success often fails to meet expectations. However, "Clinon," which has no stomach upset or any irritation and is the first preparation used for internal use, is unanimously praised by the world. There is even a cry of "Without 'Clinon,' there is no effective drug for gonorrhea, and without 'Clinon,' there are no pigment preparations," which is shouted by gonorrhea sufferers all over the world. Therefore, imitators follow one after another. Patients should recognize the true "Clinon" when purchasing and taking it, and do not blindly trust people's words and purchase cheap, miscellaneous, and inferior drugs, so as to avoid accidental ingestion and causing life-threatening consequences. The main treatment of "Clinon" is for all acute and chronic leukorrhea in men and women, arthritis, and urethral infectious diseases. For men, it protects the prostate, bladder, epididymis, and other inflammations. For women, it treats vulva, vaginal, cervical, and adnexal gonorrhea. Taking it within a certain period of time can fundamentally cure the disease and prevent recurrence for life.</p>
<h3>Serious Problems of Both Sexes</h3>
<p>— Doctor Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>How should they be solved?</p>
<p>The serious problem of both sexes is the inability to develop healthy reproductive systems. There are approximately two reasons for unhealthy reproductive development: one is congenital and the other is acquired. Those that are congenital are due to a lack of function in the adrenal and reproductive glands, resulting in unhealthy development. The person is short, resembling a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child. Those that are acquired are due to excessive masturbation during the development stage of both sexes, early marriage, and excessive sexual activity, which cause the reproductive glands to be severely damaged. Sexual organs often stop developing, remaining small and unlike normal people. There are also symptoms such as spermatorrhea and sperm leakage. In women, the buttocks and breasts cannot develop normally, remaining flat like a man's, with no typical feminine beauty. Menstruation is delayed, or the amount of menstrual blood is insufficient, often stopping altogether. The general symptoms of both sexes include dizziness, brain swelling, weakened vision, sore waist and cold knees, heart palpitations, and impaired judgment, leading to mistakes in doing things and increasing mental distress. The most serious problem is the inability to enjoy the happiness of fertility. The only way to save this disease is endocrine therapy.</p>
<p>Meredith is a recent master of endocrinology. He has worked tirelessly on research and finally invented two drugs: "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nv Rong" for women. Their raw materials are hormones extracted from strong animals, which are manufactured using new scientific methods. Taking them can exert the great effect of transforming reproductive system tissues in the shortest period of time and promote all endocrine functions. Regardless of congenital or acquired underdevelopment, and other general symptoms, the drugs can cure the disease completely. Their excellent results far surpass all hormone preparations. Therefore, countries around the world, concerned about unhealthy sexual development and neurasthenia, are happy to adopt them.</p>
<h3>Identification of Acute and Chronic Gastric Catarrh</h3>
<p>— Doctor Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>If we are careless in our diet, or fail to chew carefully, or accidentally eat spoiled food, and especially during the summer season, if we consume cold and unsanitary things, all of these can cause gastric catarrh. The catarrh at this time is acute, and its symptoms progress extremely rapidly. The person has a great aversion to food, complaining of nausea, vomiting, and sour belching. The mouth is dry, the tongue is coated with white fur, and there is bad breath and bitter water in the mouth. In severe cases, there may also be diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. The treatment of this disease requires the body to be quiet, drinking boiled water to induce artificial vomiting, and taking digestive agents at the same time, so as not to allow spoiled and fermented food to stagnate in the stomach and intestines. According to the experience of many experts, this disease can be treated with "Qiang Wei Jing." This enzyme compound preparation has both digestive and antiseptic functions. It does not irritate the stomach and intestines, so it is a symptomatic and effective drug for this disease.</p>
<p>Chronic stomach disease is transformed from acute conditions, or it is caused by smoking, drinking, and excessive use of the brain. Its symptoms include a feeling of heaviness in the stomach, nausea after eating, belching with acid reflux, bitter taste in the mouth, chest tightness, slight abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and eventually physical emaciation and pale face due to indigestion, even leading to malignant anemia and falling into critical condition. For this chronic stomach disease, the only way is to take "Qiang Wei Jing." This Liu is the most capable of correcting the function of gastric tissue cells, increasing and strengthening the appetite, so that all the above-mentioned symptoms are eliminated in one fell swoop. It also works well on the intestines. Whether there is excessive gas and farting, constipation, diarrhea, or infantile regurgitation, taking it is invariably effective. Because it contains precious nutrients and vitamin B, it can treat beriberi caused by a lack of vitamin B, and it has the power to strengthen the whole body. It is pure in nature and has no drawbacks.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment for Diseases</h3>
<p>Leukorrhea is a common disease in women, so it is often ignored because it is common. In addition, women are naturally shy, so most are unwilling to tell others, leading to suffering in silence. In addition to a constant flow of yellow and white liquid dripping from the local area, the vagina is often eroded as a result, hindering urination, causing stabbing pain and itching, and easily attracting bacteria, leading to great disasters. Therefore, women suffering from leukorrhea often experience menstrual irregularities, lower abdominal pain, and other symptoms such as a pale face, and dark circles around the eyes. Healthy beauty is also lost.</p>
<p>"Ka Er Xue Di Shi Vaginal Tablets" have long been welcomed by women in Western countries, because they have the effect of suppressing secretion, antibacterial, detoxifying, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory. They have no other adverse side effects, so every woman suffering from leukorrhea can secretly treat herself at home. Take one tablet every night and insert it into the vagina, and wash it away the next morning. However, if it is caused by a husband's transmission of gonorrhea, "Clinon" can be taken concurrently to eliminate the internal gonorrhea. If it is caused by dysmenorrhea and other conditions, "Bu Nv Rong" can be taken concurrently to strengthen the body and adjust menstruation. Following this self-treatment, it is not difficult to be cured in a few weeks.</p>
<h3>New Success in Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>The twentieth century is a world of science. All difficult problems are solved by science. The treatment of various medical disciplines is also changing with each passing day. Only gonorrhea still cannot be prevented and subdued, which is also an anomaly. Gonococci are microorganisms that are good at fleeing and escaping. Initially, they are in the local area of the reproductive organs. If the treatment is improper, they will run in different directions, leading to various complications, burning like wildfire. If local anti-inflammatory sterilization is still used, the medicinal properties will subside and the gonococci will make a comeback. Moreover, if the bactericidal drugs are too harsh, they can often kill innocent people and damage healthy tissues. If they are too mild, the gonococci will still be at ease, and they will still act recklessly. Often the root cause of the disease is deepened as a result.</p>
<p>Therefore, although there are many new gonorrhea drugs coming out recently, it is difficult to find one that is effective. Only "Clinon," invented by Peter, can be called a new success in gonorrhea treatment. In addition to specially made pigment agents, it is also mixed with various purified bactericidal agents. After taking it, it can directly exert a bactericidal effect on the lesions without harming the healthy parts. Moreover, this drug can also enhance the body's anti-gonorrhea immune factors after taking it. All gonococci scattered in various places can be surrounded and annihilated, which is far better than the local therapy of a class that can only penetrate the membrane for sterilization. For acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, epididymitis, cystitis, and women's uterine gonorrhea, vaginal gonorrhea, vulvar gonorrhea, and gonorrhea-toxic leukorrhea, taking "Clinon" invariably cures the disease in a short period of time. However, crude and shoddy yellow pigment preparations have recently been found on the market, whose surface efficacy is similar to "Clinon," which obviously contains the suspicion of shadowing "Clinon," and therefore often harms patients, so you must pay attention when purchasing.</p>
<h3>Doctor Deng Yuanhe's Trivial Talk on Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Clinic: Ningbo Road, Sichuan Road Intersection Clinic Hours: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Nutritional Issues for Improving Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Lung disease is a wasting disease, so the patient's body shows significant weakness, sharp weight loss, spiritual malaise, and poor appetite. Therefore, in terms of treatment, more attention is paid to improving nutrition. This method is not without considerable effect, but it can only be regarded as one of the treatments, and cannot be considered to have a direct curative effect on pulmonary tuberculosis. Ordinary patients are confused by this principle, and they actually regard the obesity of the body as a sign that lung disease has been cured. Therefore, they try their best to obtain fat, resulting in morbid obesity and heart disease, or because of excessive energy intake, which causes dangerous symptoms such as constipation and intestinal obstruction. Therefore, the increase of nutrition for lung disease should only be within a certain range, seeking to strengthen physical strength, and there is no need to be sturdy. However, increasing nutrition cannot destroy tuberculosis in the lungs, and basic treatment must be based on medication and recuperation. If the patient is mentally at peace and adheres to taking effective preparations continuously, a complete cure can naturally be achieved in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The so-called effective preparations are those that have been invented in recent years. Their efficacy can reduce the supply of oxygen to the diseased tissue, and the proliferation of tuberculosis bacteria is prevented, so cure is not difficult. This drug is "Bu Pu Na Er" that is currently popular in the world. Because it has the effect of increasing the connective tissue of the lungs, it can also surround and eliminate tuberculosis bacteria. It has a special effect on various stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, such as hemoptysis, bloody sputum, chest pain, tidal fever, reduced appetite, night sweats, red cheeks, limb pain, fatigue, and emaciation. It also contains rich tonic power, equal to cod liver oil, but it does not have the greasy disadvantage in hot weather. It also has a Kresol colloid, which is good for treating colds, whooping cough, chronic bronchitis, and asthma.</p>
<p>If lung patients also have neurasthenia, it is best to take this medicine at the same time with "Bu Ti Kang" for men or "Bu Nv Rong" for women, because the former can treat insomnia, weakness, palpitations, forgetfulness, etc., and the former can also treat spermatorrhea and kidney deficiency, and the latter can also treat menstrual irregularities. Taking several of them together will have a marked effect. I have repeatedly used this method to cure many people.</p>
<h3>Wet Dreams and Semen Leakage</h3>
<p>Nocturnal emission caused by erotic dreams is called wet dreams. Semen suddenly leaks out due to erotic thoughts or very slight stimulation, such as clothes rubbing, urination, or bowel movements, in young men.</p>
<p>These two diseases should be treated as early as possible, because if the patient goes on for a long time, he will develop neurasthenia, mental depression, fatigue, headache, heart palpitations, back pain, and other symptoms, and may be in danger of sudden death. Nai Shi's "Yu Jing Pian" has the effect of calming the nerves and constricting the ejaculation center, so it has a special effect on the aforementioned symptoms. Once taken, it can be completely cured. Available at Sino-Western pharmacies on Simalu.</p>
<h3>"Kelinong" Treatment Testimonies</h3>
<p>Relapse of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. Tian Fuxiong, previously suffered from leukorrhea. Introduced by a friend, he took "Kelinong," the specific medicine for gonorrhea, and recovered. Subsequently, Mr. Tian went out for business and did not return home for a long time. Therefore, his illness had long been cured, and he had almost forgotten that he had suffered from this disease. On one occasion, he returned home to visit his mother and reunited with family joy. Unexpectedly, his wife, who had been infected with gonorrhea by Mr. Tian in the past, had not recovered. As a result, Mr. Tian was infected with the disease again after a short while, deeply regretting it. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he sought treatment from Dr. Dai De, who diagnosed Mr. Tian's illness as posterior urethritis. He prescribed "Kelinong" again, while also performing surgery. He recovered completely in about four weeks. His wife's leukorrhea, caused by gonorrhea toxicity, was treated with oral "Kelinong" and external application of "Carder Sheedy's vaginal suppositories" to remove the leukorrhea, and fortunately, she was also cured in a short period. They have lived together ever since without recurrence. Their affection is unwavering.</p>
<p>Joint Swelling and Redness</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. Ni Renning, suffered from gonorrhea. Repeated treatments were ineffective. Moreover, due to his fondness for alcohol and activity, his condition took an unexpected turn. On one occasion, at a friend's invitation, after becoming heavily intoxicated, he attended a sports meet. His symptoms changed suddenly, with joint pain, inflammation, and redness, making it almost impossible to move. After multiple treatments, he still saw no improvement. He then switched to Dr. Yao Juyan's treatment, who diagnosed it as acute arthritis, with a tendency to suppurate. In addition to administering anti-gonorrhea serum injections, "Kelinong" was prescribed to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. After about three courses of treatment, significant effects were observed. At the follow-up visit, the condition had improved by 60-70%. He was instructed to continue taking "Kelinong" for more than ten days, and the condition was completely eliminated. To this day, he continues to drink and work without recurrence.</p>
<p>Weakness and Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. Pan Dajun, had always been weak. Last year, he became involved in the flower business, and as a result, he contracted gonorrhea. Due to his weakness, although the illness was not very severe, it was very difficult to cure. Therefore, Mr. Pan felt even more anxious, leading to the development of seminal emission. Subsequently, introduced by Dr. Deng Yuanhe, he was instructed to take "Kelinong" in addition to "Butil Kang" regularly. After several weeks of taking the medication, the gonorrhea was eliminated, and the seminal emission also disappeared. Moreover, his health has become better than before, and those who see him say he is like a completely different person.</p>
<p>A Clear Song</p>
<p>Patient, Mr. Lin Qinshan, was a dashing young man who enjoyed frequenting brothels but remained cautiously self-controlled, daring not to fall. One evening, he accepted a friend's invitation to listen to a prostitute sing a clear song. He was instantly captivated, and soon after, he contracted gonorrhea. The urethra was burning and stinging, and the foreskin and glans were red, swollen, and inflamed, causing great pain. This was acute gonorrhea. Fortunately, Mr. Lin was familiar with the efficacy of "Kelinong." He purchased and took several bottles, and the pain and swelling subsided. After about three weeks of treatment, he was completely cured. A subsequent blood test showed a negative, non-toxic reaction, which is evidence of a radical cure.</p>

<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Treatment for Radical Cure of Acute Gonorrhea</p>
<p>A Western philosopher said, "To treat gonorrhea urgently is truly the patient's blessing." This is because, in the early stages of gonorrhea, although the symptoms are quite alarming, treatment is much easier than for chronic gonorrhea, which is stubborn and difficult to cure. In the acute phase, the gonococci are only in the anterior urethra. If treated properly, a radical cure can be achieved in about three weeks. Generally, three to four days after contact with unclean individuals of the opposite sex, the patient initially feels itching in the urethra, like ants crawling. Then, burning. Urination becomes difficult, and then pus-like fluid flows from the urethra. Nocturnal erection-related seminal emission is frequent, and often at this time, sexual desire is strong. If married, there is also the danger of transmitting this terrible gonorrhea poison to the wife. At that time, due to the secretions of pus, the glans and foreskin are stimulated, becoming red and swollen. The urge to urinate is frequent, but each urination is extremely difficult, with unbearable pain, causing shouting day and night, unable to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of these symptoms, treatment should be sought promptly to avoid missing the opportunity. The latest modern treatment, in addition to local washing, includes electrical and X-ray therapy. At the same time, take Kelinong specific medicine to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. It is not difficult to cure in about three weeks. As for the unfortunate case of having sex during the acute phase, causing vaginal gonorrhea and uterine gonorrhea in the wife, with incessant vaginal discharge, in addition to still taking Kelinong specific medicine internally, vaginal suppositories should be used externally to remove the leukorrhea and avoid local infiltration and erosion. Recovery will also be rapid. All couples infected with gonorrhea should be treated according to this method.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Fourteen-Year-Old Elementary School Student Commits Suicide Out of Patriotic Concern</h3>
<p>— Fang Jiu</p>
<p>In the past, there were cases of suicide due to patriotic concerns, such as Nanjing military officer Xu Fanting's suicide by cutting open his abdomen and Supervisory Yuan member Du Yi's suicide by drowning. Now, there is a report that Zhou Zixin, a fourteen-year-old elementary school student from Pucheng, committed suicide by swallowing nitric acid water. In this time of national crisis, when the enemy's iron hooves are about to trample our beautiful land, how can these solemn actions of suicide for the country not move people to tears?</p>
<p>While we express solemn respect for the patriotic suicides of military officer Xu Fanting and Supervisory Yuan member Du Yi, we do not think suicide is the solution. Although it is also a passive method, it stimulates the hearts of us living who have not yet died.</p>
<p>Elementary school students have particularly rich emotions. Therefore, they immediately cry when moved. They conceal nothing. Because of the increasing decline of the national situation, elementary school students want to go into the mountains to seek immortals and visit Daoists. This is because, after mastering magic, they can serve the country! However, this is a poor result of education, failing to guide elementary school students' patriotic concepts onto the right track. But what about the act of patriotic suicide by elementary school students? Strictly speaking, this is also a poor result of education.</p>
<p>We see that Zhou Zixin paid close attention to the national crisis on weekdays, and teachers and friends alike valued him. He often went to the library to read newspapers. What the newspapers published was, of course, worrying. Two sentences in the will of Zhou Zixin, this respectable and lovely child, moved me twelve hundred thousand times: " are forcing us so severely, and we are still fighting each other internally." This is what a fourteen-year-old child feels. Is it not the same as what we older youths, adults, and seniors feel?</p>
<p>I say that this elementary school student's patriotic suicide is, strictly speaking, also the result of poor education. This is because teachers only tell elementary school students about the tragic national situation on weekdays, but do not further encourage them and point out a correct path to save the country.</p>
<p>We should stand up solemnly and give the highest salute to this patriotic young student who committed suicide!</p>
<h3>Village Scenery</h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>This time I went back to my hometown, I planned to stay at home for a long time. Indeed, I had already crawled enough on this long and difficult journey of life, passing the years like a snail. Since leaving home at the age of fifteen until now, I have not smelled the scent of grass and wheat from my hometown. I've only been mingling in the dusty metropolis, carrying the heavy burden of life.</p>
<p>Who knew that even before I had lived at home for ten days, I had returned to Shanghai. Everything in my hometown caused me so much pain! The impressions that remain in my mind still worry me.</p>
<p>I remember my hometown in my childhood, it was so full of life! Dense black smoke would rise from the chimneys of every house in the village. Houses were connected one after another, densely packed like beehives, so crowded that there were no small lanes for walking. In the early morning or at dusk, the village head was crowded with people; old people showed a kind smile, enthusiastically talking about ancient stories. Young people cheerfully talked about the scandalous affairs of who the village girls were sleeping with and who the young men were sleeping with in the villages around. Young women dressed like brides all year round—wearing red and green, proud of their beautiful youth, sitting together in groups of three or five, discussing trivial things. Children could be seen all day long on the threshing ground, playing hide-and-seek, and their innocent feelings flowed out from behind the rice stacks. The sounds of old women calling pigs and scolding chickens and ducks added to the commotion.</p>
<p>I have only been away from my hometown for five years, which is not a long time. How rapid are the changes in human affairs! It has become dilapidated like an old temple, and I can no longer hear joyful laughter. The resentment squeezed out by the heavy burden of life, like dark clouds, surrounds the village and fills the wilderness…</p>
<p>The day I returned home, my elderly uncle, leading my six-year-old nephew, excitedly ran to a small road four or five miles away to meet me.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he was too excited! Seeing this nephew who had not become rich, returning home for a while, made him fall deeper into the abyss of pain. Sitting under the flickering light of the vegetable oil lamp, everyone was silent—my uncle, aunt, brother, sister-in-law, and nephew, all hung their heads low, unable to say a word. This terrible silence, on the first day, wounded this traveler's heart that longed for his hometown.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, I said to my uncle: I want to go back to my own home and live there for a while. When my uncle heard this, he showed an even sadder face. He told me in a trembling voice: "Ah, do you think there is still a home? The walls have collapsed, and even the bricks have been taken away. Ah…" He sobbed, old tears streaming down his haggard face: "Ah! Do you still remember your aunt? This woman was no good. In the first year you left, she ran away with two men from other places, heartlessly leaving your brother…" He raised his weak hand and pointed at my aunt, meaning to ask her to respond to his words.</p>
<p>My aunt stood aside, also shedding tears. She wiped her eyes with her sleeve and said: "Hey! He's been dead for a long time, what's there to say!"</p>
<p>My uncle's village is only five or six miles away from my home, separated by a mountain. After crossing the mountain slope, my home can be seen. At this time, it was the stifling hot weather of deep summer, and the golden wheat seedlings in the fields were waving in the breeze. But the fields on both sides of the small road were so desolate, with only scattered rotten straw. Today, I finally believe that the world has really reached the point where there is land but no one to cultivate it.</p>
<p>When I arrived home, the sun had already set in the west, and the village seemed so deserted that there wasn't a single living creature. At the head of the village stood a middle-aged man as thin as a reed stick, feebly chopping withered trees. We looked at each other with surprised eyes. I didn't recognize him, and he didn't seem to know me either. After we passed him, he continued his work of chopping trees. I asked my elder brother, who is that person? He suddenly put on a strange expression and asked me in return: "What, don't you even recognize this person? He's Cai Laoer, who used to lead you around all day!"</p>
<p>"Oh! It's Cai Laoer!" A vivid memory revived in my mind. Cai Laoer, what a kind and optimistic man he used to be! But now, he… I dare not delve further into the memories of the past in my mind.</p>
<p>I hung my head low, stubbornly gritted my teeth, and rushed straight into my house, which had already fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p>After only staying there for one night, I returned to my uncle's house. A piece of the collar of my little jacket, stained with oil, was bitten off by rats while I slept at night, and my elder brother was even bitten on the finger.</p>
<p>To this day, I still carefully keep that tattered jacket with the collar eaten away. That is the only souvenir of my trip back to my hometown!</p>

<h3>Summer Flowers</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>The most praised flower in summer is the lotus, but in this article, I don't want to talk about it, because I have another article specifically written about it.</p>
<p>The first flower since entering summer is the pomegranate. "The pomegranate flower shines brightly in May," its fiery scarlet color already symbolizes the heat of summer. Its strong burning flavor is like that of a southern girl, burning with fire-like enthusiasm in her healthy body. It is a force, a heart-piercing force. Under the bright summer sun, I don't know how many neurasthenic people dare not look directly at it.</p>
<p>Following the pomegranate flower is the plump gardenia. Han Tuizhi's poem "Banana leaves are large and gardenias are fat," this is a flower that symbolizes the pleasantness of summer. It carries the charm of a young woman. Although it does not seduce with its beauty, its plumpness truly gives people endless aftertaste. The gardenia is originally a subtropical flower. Therefore, "Wu Za Zu" says, "This flower is extremely abundant in Fujian and is cheap. It and jasmine and zhilan all grow regardless of the soil. It only gradually becomes valuable when it reaches Wu and Chu." The author of "Wu Za Zu" was a person from the Ming Dynasty, but his words still apply today. Among the hundreds of flowers, there are not many with six petals. The gardenia flower is one of the six-petaled ones. Therefore, there is a Wu song that says, "The gardenia flower has six petal heads," specially marking its characteristic—six petals—as a "starting point" for a love song. We have three or four gardenia plants in our house. My cousins and sisters all come to my house for temporary stays during the summer vacation. I am often entrusted by them to pick some newly opened gardenias early in the morning and soak them in water trays for them to wear in their hair when they comb their hair. Because we have our own, they always change to new ones two or three times a day. The young girls in the neighborhood occasionally beg for some, and soak them in water trays for them to wear in their hair for two or three days. In the evening, everyone gathers in the courtyard to enjoy the cool air. Sometimes it is very dark at night, and we cannot see the people opposite us, but only the fragrance of gardenias wafts in the wind, telling us that they are there.</p>
<p>"Banana leaves are large and gardenias are fat." Although the banana also blooms, that is limited to Fujian and Guangdong. Bananas in Jiangnan rarely bloom. Therefore, people say that the banana flower is the Yulan magnolia, but I don't know if that is true. However, although the banana does not bloom much, the canna blooms in summer. The beauty of the canna is different from the banana flower. Not only is the canna red and yellow, while the banana is white, but the appearance is also different. Chen Liuxian said, "The leaves of the canna tree are all like bananas but bloom less. They are bright red and gorgeous, with thousands of petals like mallets. They do not wither for several months. If you pick them and put them in a bottle and soak them in water, they can also last for a month or two." Indeed, if someone's garden has one or two cannas, then the long summer will not be lonely.</p>
<p>Tuberose, jasmine, and zhalan are all summer flowers. The Five Dynasties poem "Tuberose flowers in Hainan," then, the tuberose is undoubtedly a subtropical flower. Jasmine and zhalan can still be seen from time to time in Jiangnan, but they are very expensive between Yan and Zhao. These three flowers mostly win with fragrance, and their color and shape are nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Night-blooming jasmine is one of the main summer flowers. The ancients said, "This flower is conceived in the sun and blooms on the pillow. It is truly a lewd flower that delights the night, a seductive flower that lingers." Therefore, some people even say that the fragrance of the night-blooming jasmine must be mixed with the flesh, fragrance, and powder of women, then the marvel of it will be fully realized. I really have no reason to deny this.</p>
<p>White magnolia is not seen in ancient books, but it is currently very popular in Shanghai. Its fragrance is similar to that of night-blooming jasmine. If my feeling is correct, then it is more lewd than night-blooming jasmine, or perhaps it is popular in the city because of its lewdness.</p>
<p>When summer is about to end, the pure white tuberose goes on the market. This is a flower with a slight autumn feel. Its purity and its elegance are contrary to those of night-blooming jasmine and white magnolia. Now I already long for it, not to mention that what will come with it will be the clear and distant early autumn!</p>
<h3>The Lost Smile</h3>
<p>— Qiying</p>
<p>The whip of life drove me out of school. I regarded this society as the Garden of Eden, not facing reality and not caring about the unfortunate encounters of my kind being slaughtered. I indulged my character, arrogant of myself. Even in front of my superiors, I was willful, regardless of people's hatred or joy, doing what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Then, some worldly friends older than me warned me? "××, you shouldn't be so naive!"</p>
<p>Yes, I shouldn't be so naive. Sometimes, when I heard such warnings from friends, my fragile and immature mind was hit hard. I vowed to deeply imprint this sentence in my mind and no longer knowingly violate it, but soon I returned to my original state.</p>
<p>When I was happy, I would forget everything. A bright and gentle sunlight seemed to envelop my fragile soul. In a group of friends, I learned to jump and laugh happily like a child, saying whatever I thought. Just as a word flowed out of my mouth, and my cheeks opened up when I laughed, a shadow of melancholy would cover my heart again. Because I may encounter malicious sarcasm from people. In their contemptuous sneers, I heard some words that would hurt my soul. I often exchanged a full heart of enthusiasm for people's cold faces.</p>
<p>In this way, I hesitated, I wavered, and I didn't know how to behave. I read many books on social science. I asked many friends about some of my difficult problems, but they all could not give me a satisfactory answer. I ran into walls on all sides, and I didn't have a close friend. Loneliness and sadness surrounded my heart.</p>
<p>During the day, I hid in a small and low room. I was doing something dishonorable, and I let painful memories and heavy coal smoke and heavy moisture torment my young life all day long. In the evening, unable to bear the silence, even if there was a heavy rain falling outside the window, I had to run out into the deserted street like a wild horse. Only when people were already intoxicated in the dreamland could I breathe a little fresh air!</p>
<p>The arrival of one season is also the passing of another season. My young man's senses had become so dull that they were almost like an idiot. All year round, on my dazed face, a dead silence could not raise a smile.</p>
<p>Finally, even a place to eat could not be found. A kind-hearted friend advised me:</p>
<p>"×× You have forgotten yourself, you have forgotten what kind of road fate has given you, you need to laugh, you need to laugh!"</p>
<p>He took me to a group of adult gentlemen, he told me: you get to know them, you don't have to worry about no way out; but you need to laugh. However, I can't laugh anymore. Even if I laugh, how lonely and miserable is that laugh!</p>
<h3>Water Wheel (1)</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>The eight mu of land gets water from the Dakunpi Port. The dyke is high and the water is shallow. It is really not easy to hoist water with a water wheel that requires five people to tread. The eight mu of land used to belong to three households in total: two mu to Shunfu, the crooked mouth, four mu to Uncle Shougen, and two mu to Qing Sheng's widow. When water was scarce, Uncle Shougen would always shout at the top of his voice to call people to tread the water wheel. His family farmed four mu of rice fields, so he was naturally anxious, and he hired a farmhand, so he didn't have to exert himself.</p>
<p>This morning, Qing Sheng's widow was moving her hairdressing tools to the threshing ground to fix her hair when Uncle Shougen walked over with his only son, who was born when he was forty-two years old: "You plan to dress up and go where?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Uncle Shougen, good morning. I'm going to town to buy some odds and ends." She held up her half-undone bun. The morning sun could not hide the gloom on her face. "It will be the anniversary of my family's… Mao Xiao's father's death in four days!"</p>
<p>Counting it, Qing Sheng, that poor and honest man, had been dead for three years. Mao Xiao was seven years old when he cried while holding the bamboo pole and memorial tablet for his father. He is ten years old this year, but he is so thin and small. His nose always sounds like he has a cold, and you can't pinch off an ounce or two of meat from his face. Old Mr. Mei Tang from Dong Village diagnosed him as having exhaustion from lack of male vitality. No one in the village likes him. Qing Sheng's widow always cries for him, sometimes crying for half a day at Qing Sheng's grave. But no one gives her sympathetic pity. Uncle Shougen didn't care about Qing Sheng's anniversary at all. He just warned:</p>
<p>"You know the eight mu of land needs water wheeling, today, today!"</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, but… I'll just call my Mao Xiao to come, I still have to go to the Earth God Temple to burn paper…" Uncle Shougen's only son in his arms cried. He seemed very impatient to hear her talk about inauspicious dead people. He "hmphed" at her, coaxing his child, while turning around and walking towards the back door of Shunfu's, the crooked mouth's, house, muttering: "Water wheeling always sends children to do it. Others always take advantage of you. Is it enough for your two mu of land to send a little sick ghost…" These words, these words… (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening: The Palace of Eternal Life "Palace Grievance"</p>
<p>In the silent night of the West Palace, the fragrance of hundreds of flowers fills the air.  She wishes to roll up the pearl curtain, but her spring sorrow is long. The Precious Consort sits alone on the agarwood couch, burning red candles high, awaiting her sovereign. Gao Lishi announces, "Your Majesty is at Zhaoyang Palace tonight."  When Taizhen hears this, her worries deepen. Lazily, she removes her palace makeup. She falls asleep, fully clothed, on the mandarin duck quilt, seeing a round bright moon shining on the palace walls. Lonely, on a cold pillow, she sleeps forlornly, streams of tears running down her cheeks with heartache. I advise people not to accompany emperors, for accompanying them is like accompanying a tiger. Consider the Empress, with her matchless beauty; why has she been cast aside?  It would be better to marry a dashing young man, enjoying pleasure from dawn till dusk. Crepe myrtles face crepe myrtle lovers.</p>
<p>He Yunfang, He Qinfang, Double Pearl Ball</p>
<p>Lin Kee (1220) 2:15 PM to 3:00 PM Opening: "The Ten Ideologies"</p>
<p>The first hint of spring melts into the night. Two parts of the bright moon shine through the curtains. At the third watch, sitting alone, one seems drunk. The four seasons of longing are always empty. At the fifth watch, the rooster crows, but one has not yet slept; the sixth son's face is covered in tears. The seventh night is difficult to await the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's meeting. Eight lines of letters cannot express the depths of their affection. Nine twists in the intestines, the intestines feel like they will break. Ten attempts to understand Ding Lang's intentions are hazy. On the twelve-storied tower, one waits in vain. Kyushu is forged of iron, and the regret is endless. The eyebrows, shaped like the character eight, are constantly locked in sorrow. The seven-stringed zither expresses deep resentment. The six-foot tall man is trapped by love's demons. Fine furs and spirited horses are entrusted to the east wind. It's not easy to talk about the four great elements being empty. Three lifetimes without fate, one resents the heavens. Separated in two places, one often remembers each other. A little spiritual connection is not allowed. A hundred years of affairs have been entrusted to the flowing waters of the east. A thousand miles of letters have vanished without a trace. Ten thousand bushels of sorrow are in one's dreams.</p>

<p>Yuanchang (1120) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "A Small Feast in the Red Chamber" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue) Daiyu's former graceful bearing has not diminished. Gradually, her spirit returns to its former state. She no longer needs to wear gold hairpins, her loosened temples and hair. Her silk dress hangs loosely on her slender waist. Baoyu secretly noticed this and gently advised her. The autumn scenery of the painted screen is beautiful.  In the smoke of burnt medicine, they compete in new poems. Look, the gauze window shadow forms a natural picture. The silver candle illuminates the autumn scene in a wonderfully beautiful verse. If you deliberately lie alone on your bed, I fear you will be laughed at by Chang'e for being foolish. The Yingchun sisters smiled radiantly, saying that one must seize the moment for happiness in life. They ordered Ziyuan to immediately arrange a small feast. The sisters sat in order without declining. The fragrance of osmanthus flowers accompanies the golden goblet filled to the brim. Writing flows from the brush without effort. Baoyu, however, was penalized with the golden goblet, his fair face already flushed. Leaning on the railing, he tried to gaze at the moon in the sky. Without any defects, it was a wonderful time. Cold dew lightly sprinkles the flower branches.</p>

<h3>Star Film Company Second Studio Holds Major Rehearsal</h3>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian and Ying Yunwei Direct, Most of the Second Studio's Actors Perform</p>
<p>On July 17th, the Star Film Company's Second Studio convened film crew members who had not yet worked together for a rehearsal. The main principle of this rehearsal was to have this group of new people on the same line of work gain an initial understanding and connection with each other before the start of the Second Studio's two opening productions: Ying Yunwei's "United Hearts in Life and Death" and Ouyang Yuqian's "Qingming Season". The rehearsal was divided into two groups. The first group was directed by Ouyang Yuqian, with actresses Li Minghui, Li Lilian, Wang Feijuan, Zhang Dieping, Lu Luming, and others, and male actors Xie Jingbo, Li Qing, Tian Chen, and others. The second group was directed by Ying Yunwei, with actresses Gong Qiuxia, Ying Yin, Hu Rongrong, and others, and male actors Wang Ruoxi, Liu Mang, Yao Ping, and others. On the technical side, the cinematographer for the first group was Yan Bingheng, and the sound engineers were the He Zhaohuang and Zhaozhang brothers. The cinematographer for the second group was Wu Yin Xian, and the sound engineer was Lu Yinkeng. This rehearsal was no different from an actual film shoot, except that the directors only gave the actors a few interesting lines of dialogue and a brief plot outline based on their personalities, but they still performed as if it were real. Those who could sing, like Li Minghui, Gong Qiuxia, and Ying Yin, sang a few songs, and the performances of those burly men like Li Qing also included fist fights. The performance started at 2:00 PM and ended at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Most Complete Song Selection: Collection of Voices of China to be Published Soon</h3>
<p>The Collection of Voices of China (Selection of Heroic Songs) is compiled by Zhou Weishi, mainly selected by Li Gongpu, and proofread by Sun Shiyi. The song collection gathers the most recent songs that reflect reality and awaken the masses. There are over 110 songs in total. This collection does not contain decadent, sentimental tunes, nor moans of personal private life, nor deceptive sermons that anesthetize people. What you will find here is the roar of a lion after awakening, and the long howl of breaking free from shackles. For the convenience of practical application, the entire collection divides the songs into seven parts: national, youth, workers and peasants, soldiers, women, children, and voices of the times, and includes the sheet music for national anthems of various countries for research purposes. At the same time, in order to enable the public to read numbered musical notation and know how to sing, the editor has also written out some of the most common and frequently used rules in a very accessible way, so that those who have read it can self-study singing methods. The collection is also arranged in a very neat format, correcting all the mistakes found in those boring so-called selections and collections. This is currently the most complete song collection, and also an extremely needed song collection during the high tide of the national salvation movement. In order to promote the "Voices of National Salvation," each copy is sold for only 15 cents, and will be published before the end of the month, distributed by Reading Life Publishing House.</p>

<h3>Disney Wins Last Year's Top Cartoon Award</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>The famous cartoon artist Walt Disney was awarded the 1936 Academy of Arts and Sciences Award for his masterpiece "Three Orphan Kittens" from last year. This cartoon film is considered the best work of 1935.</p>
<p>"Three Orphan Kittens" is a color cartoon that tells the story of two kittens making mischief in a house, inciting a mouse to create a commotion on the piano out of hatred for a cook.</p>
<p>Disney is truly a great filmmaker; including this time, he has received the award four times.</p>
<p>The 1932 award-winning work was "Flowers and Trees."</p>
<p>The 1933 award-winner was "Three Little Pigs."</p>
<p>The 1934 award-winner was "The Tortoise and the Hare."</p>
<p>The "Three Little Pigs" and other cartoons were screened around the world and were very popular, with audiences unanimously praising his drawing skills.</p>
<p>The famous filmmaker and manager Kodak praised him in fifteen words: "He is a rare and great contributor to the film industry."</p>
<p>Finally, here's another piece of news for readers: Disney has left United Artists and joined RKO Pictures.</p>
<p>His new work "Clubhouse Sketches" is already in production, assisted by the new female cartoon writer Annie Manlin.</p>
