<h3 id="c16">倫敦談話與英國外交的歸趨 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>英國首相包爾溫近半年來的外交成績如何。一言以蔽之。出賣了阿比西尼亞。隳毀了國聯的威信。損害了英國的榮譽而已。保守黨以卑怯者的手段。放棄了集體安全的政策。而仍以最漂亮的口號。實現了整軍黷武的主張。我們看到保守黨的代言人。說什麼武力的的束。又將代替法律的的束。說什麼裁軍將使英國實際的力量。不能履行他的道德的威權。說什麼要實行集體安全。必以武力為後盾。又必劃分區域縮小範圍。說什麼此後英國軍事行動。必以國聯精神為指歸。這種飾辭。並不能掩護他們的詭謀。凡爾賽條約旣被德國蹴毀於前。國聯又因取銷制裁而崩潰於後。怎樣防備歐洲最有野心而最有貪慾的德意。怎樣防備亞洲最有野心而最有貧慾的日本。這都是目前保守黨所碰到而應謀對付的問題。對付前兩國的方法。英國保守黨內的重要角色。雖抱負稍有不同。然而我們也可以由各方面看出他們一致的傾向。墨索里尼穩取了阿比西尼亞。也像希特勒對於薩爾一樣。宣佈他已滿足。以後對於非洲要維持原先狀態。這話是否確實。誰也不能保證。可是對於短視的保守黨人。顯然是一個不小的鎭驚劑。保守黨的要角如邱吉爾·奧斯汀·張伯倫輩。遂希望恢復所謂斯脫萊薩陣綫。拉墨索里尼加入先前的集團。使意大利做白倫山隘的崗衛。而使德國不再窺多瑙河流域。這是他們心所嚮往的事。德奧因意國的從中牽引。成立了親善協定。這在國際的意義上如何。其中的含義。是否如這條約表面上所表示的一樣。又是否恰如英國所希冀。這都是將來的問題。而不是現在所能推測的。可是這條約的簽訂。我們在英國保守黨的報紙。也可以見到不少讚美的論調。正如意大利報紙竭力捧他們的首相所完成的外交上的勝利一樣。這可見他們並不以意大利給他們戴上「不光榮」的帽子而介懷。更不因意大利的結成法西斯陣營而畏懼。就他方面來說。英國保守黨人的對德。早已另眼看待。保守黨人主張。歐洲問題如果沒有德國參加。就將失其重要性。而英國欲保持其北境安全。也只有與德妥協。他們因此高呼出凡爾賽條約。是愚笨的產物。德國是國際落魄者。欲使德國滿足。須使其有殖民地。這樣的為德人張目。自然要使德國五體投地。雖則德國的野心。是英人所素知。而德國最近在希里哥倫島重建海軍。會使英國的北境。又如大戰時一樣。感受到德國堅利海軍的威脅。但在保守黨看來。他們寗願有一個咆哮的「那茲」東向。而不願有一個以集體安全為號召的蘇聯西來。和平在他們眼中。原不是多麽值得重視的事。</p>
<p>至於對東亞方面。保守黨在外交上仍然維持他們的故態而沒有改變。前幾年。那位著名的律師前外相西門。曾經在國聯替東方的野心國家。曲盡過辯護的責任。造成了東亞不可收拾的局勢。於是那野心國家由東省而熱河。而華北。目標所指不但在東亞大陸。甚有席捲澳洲疾趨馬萊亞直達紅海之勢。老大帝國也就坐臥不安起來。趕緊來擴建新加坡的根據地。最近增撥了二百萬鎊。以為增添防務之用。並擬以强有力海軍。分駐於新加坡。以與柬印度。紐西蘭。澳洲的分隊合作。這表明他們已戚覺到有被那以前卵翼下的「與國」反噬的危險。和事前防衛的必要了。軍事上的姿態是防衛的。經濟上的姿態。如最近澳洲的增高日貨的入口稅。也是防衛的。而外交上的姿態。說來可眞奇怪。却又是力圖妥協約。羅斯的覓取英日在華妥協約途徑。當然不必說。日前英國貴族院中討論中國問題。前外次牛頓勳爵替日本竭力辯護。說日本四十年受歐洲不良待遇。致取銷英日同盟。及誤信人言。干涉滿洲事件等語。若不勝其惋惜。而現任公共工程大臣史坦賀浦勳爵。亦似以未能獲得締結英中日三方皆能滿意的條約。引為憾事。國際政治家而如商人。以唯利是圖為其政策的不二法門。從最實利的觀點來求保持其殘餘利益。國際的事件。豈不要愈弄愈糟。終於走向不可收拾之局呢。</p>
<p>今日英國保守黨的政策。就似乎犯了這樣一個錯誤。從刺刀上覓和平。從火藥中檢實利。和平有時而窮。實利有時而盡。等到和平窮實利盡。那末。必然的結果。就是軒然大波。隨之而起了。</p>

<p>— 本報記者胡仲持胡一臧</p>
<p>於是他送給我們幾稅小書和印刷品，一種是昭和十年版的「神戶市勢要覽」。此外便是觀光課所編的印得很美麗的，「觀光之神戶」「神戶案內」「源平的史蹟」「神戶社寺探訪」「神戶市繪葉書」等等。他指着「神戶市勢要覽」對我們說，「昭和十一年版還沒有印好。關於本市財政的材料，從道里也可以找到一點」。</p>
<p>（註）據神戶市勢要覽所載，昭和八年度的神戶市歲出入預算，在歲入項下，屬於普通經濟的市費是一千七百六十八萬餘元，（日金）屬於特別經濟的是日金二千五百四十七萬餘元。歲出項下，經常二千七百七十萬餘元，臨時一千五百三十萬餘元。昭和八年度神戶市民所負擔的直接國稅和市稅都比七年度增加了。每人平均負擔額是直接國稅九元五十錢，市稅十元六十五錢，合計二十元十五錢。</p>
<p>我們不想再問什麽了，便向甲斐秘書道了謝，走出市役所來。</p>
<p>（五）榮町和元町</p>
<p>午後，我們要參觀當地的報館，便到榮町去，這是神戶的金融中心接二連三地轟立着石造的和鋼骨水泥的大厦，不是什麽銀行，就是什麽會社。神戶的兩烟地方報館又新日報社和神戶新開社也都在那地方。</p>
<p>我們先到又新日報社。招待我們的是編輯局社會部記者近江要。隨後又到神戶新聞社，招待我們的也是編輯局社會部的一位記者。這兩家報社規模都不大，前者的資本四十萬元（日金）社長呌高木藏吉，後者的資本五十萬元，社長啡進藤信義，內部的組織，大致相同。全社分編輯印刷營業三局。編輯局又分政治經濟社會學藝四部。每天的政治新聞都須送縣廳檢查。印刷局里一切機械，連印報的捲筒機在內，都是國內製造的。排字的工人一律穿着玄色的工服，較輕易的工作如還鉛字之類是女工據任的。</p>
<p>晚上，江總領事邀了我們在榮町銀水西餐館吃飯。這餐館開設在一所銀行大厦的地下層。從大理石的扶梯下去，是一個廣大的餐廳，布置得富麗堂皇，四壁掛着名貴的油畫，中問有着噴水池。我們先進另一間的休息室跟江總領事和潘副領事閑談了一會，再到餐廳來進餐。主人的盛情，塲所的幽雅，餚饌的豐盛，以及美貌的女給（女侍役）的殷勤的服役，使我們感覺到無限的感激和愉快。</p>
<p>從餐館出來，我們向江潘兩領事道了謝，便徒步到元町去遊覽。這是神戶熱閘的中心之一。柏油的街道並不見得怎麽寬，也沒有電車軌道經過。兩旁整齊的鈴蘭式的電燈聯成無數的輝煌的弧綫。這種路燈的式樣聽說是日本一個工科敎授所設計的。街道兩旁開着日本風的各種小商店，問或也有宏壯的大百貨店，和華麗的跳舞塲咖啡店之類。有一段馬路上成列的攤販，在各自裝着的瓦斯燈下做生意，使這市街更添了然鬧。我們夾在各式各樣服裝的人羣中間走，不時聽到從兩旁傳送過來的無綫電廣播的日本歌曲的音調，看到冶遊的靑年們挽着舞女的手臂從跳舞塲走出來，禁不住心頭漾起了綺麗的異國的情味。</p>
<p>回到旅館已經上點鐘了。潘副領事知道我們明天早上就要到大阪去，深晚偕同領事館主事陳德齊到旅館來跟我們長談了一番。幸虧他們兩位的指點，我們在以後的旅行上得到了不少的便利。我們眞忘不掉他們的厚意和敎益。</p>

<p>抑平匯水　當中央銀行未在成渝組設分行之先、兩地外兌欵項、匯水之高、駭人聞聽、最高率為兌滬一千元須貼匯水四百四十元、且漲跌無恒、奸商從中換縱、正當商家在泥購運貨物、莫不大受損失、自中央銀行頌行平過匯兌辦法後、川滬間匯兌、取費旣廉，又不貼水、於是川省外兌欵項、異常便利、川滬商運、亦漸恢復過去盛况、</p>
<p>收毀地鈔　前四川地方銀行、發行鈔券三千萬元、因其在重慶發出、成都市塲簡稱之日渝鈔、或地鈔、其價格亦如過去匯水之漲落不定、時而漲至九折餘、時而跌至六折餘、一般平民生活、為之不安、自委員長行營、毅然决策、公佈命令、以法幣八成、收毀地鈔十成後、由川省政府以整理金融公債、抵借法幣二千四百萬元、請託中央兩分行、陸績收回地鈔三千萬元、旋收旋毀、至去歲年終地鈔遂絕跡於川省各處市塲、</p>
<p>推行法幣　國府頒布新貨幣政策時、滬漢各埠物價、略為騰貴、惟川省市面、未受若何影響、其原因卽為中央銀行明訂辦法，取銷匯水、一律平兌、成渝分行、收交概用法幣、兩市商人、感受高率匯費之苦、一旦解除重負、均樂用法幣兌外、無法幣者、紛紛以現金購買、彼時成都市塲、須用現金一百一二十元、始能購得法幣百元、故法幣在川得以通行，嗣後因中央銀行遵照命令、特許各銀行、用現金六成、公價四成、領取法幣十成、各行競購現金、因而法幣價格、略為低落、而各銀行得此頜鈔補助、獲益良多、由是金融益為穩定、</p>
<p>發行輔幣　川省銅輔幣數量之多、質量之劣、種類之雜、甲於全國、嗣因奸商操縱、鄉愚囤積銅元、反致劣幣成為奇貨、今年四五月間、每法幣一元、只換得十八千文、尙不易得、各錢店均將換錢招牌卸下、換錢一角、須有交誼者、始獲首肯、一時城廂內外、頗覺恐慌、及至六月、中央造幣廠所鑄銅鎳輔幣、運到川省、先在重慶發行、嗣復陸續運抵成都、數量共計百數十萬元、逐漸普及社會、於是法幣換兌困難、完全解除、從此幣價永無漲跌、物價亦得平衡、惟是川省舊鑄惡劣銅元仍然流行於市、人民不無受害之處、希望政府頒發明令、廢止舊鑄一切惡劣銅元、限期由官廳收毀改鑄、同時由中央銀行續運銅鎳輔幣來川、以資調劑、如是則紊亂多年之川省幣制問題、卽可澈底解决、人民生計亦可安定也、</p>

<p>新閘路淸凉禪寺住持僧淸海、與通和洋行執行異議之案、昨日上午八時餘、由第一特院王去非推事蒞第十民庭更新審理、旁聽者如該寺維持會中西各紳士·以及機關代表·等三十餘人、首由原告代理陸起律師起稱、第二被告盛毓郵、旣在英國、卽無法簽字委任、今其代理律師到庭、依法無權代理、惟本案</p>
<p>情形複雜</p>
<p>欲詳細明白案情、非將通和洋行與淸凉寺以前訴訟經過及兩造所訂租的暨通和洋行是否眞正受抵、有無訴追權能等分別說明不可、查消凉寺之使用辛家花園系爭地、及地上舊屋、遠在民國十年左右、初實由盛莊氏卽盛毓郵之祖母捐助寺方、故原告於民國十三年齊盧戰後、卽開始募捐、</p>
<p>建造新屋</p>
<p>如殿宇齋堂等、計共一百餘間、迨至民十六年、國府調查盛氏財產充公、盛莊氏一面為避免政府充公起見、一面復防寺方受贈後、力不能於五年期限內建造完工、因此由莊氏片面書就租賃合同、責令原告蓋章、以為兩全之計、不意名莊氏於交換合同未幾、卽告病故、盛家</p>
<p>初無異議</p>
<p>及至上年、始有通和洋行以受抵人名義、出而訴請遷讓交屋、在原審初未嘗不注意到通和洋行訴追人不適格、根本無權訴追、因盛毓郵到庭證稱一切、權柄早經移轉與通和、致原審因此受理、且查訴訟標的、據稱在三十五萬以上、而原審則在簡易庭判决、並且在三容中兩被告始終未將盛毓郵出抵通和</p>
<p>受抵合同</p>
<p>正本呈庭出示、卽在案之英文本與譯文、處處不同、連出抵人及中保人之姓氏、都付缺如、且查兩被告抵押合同譯文中、將系爭地上原告所造及未完工之全部廟字、一併作抵、縱使受抵、實屬不特遠法訂的、抑且荒乎其唐、豈寺方所造廟宇、地主有權出抵、甚而將未完工之房屋、均可指押、</p>
<p>實為奇聞</p>
<p>原告因所有權之被奪、致有今日執行異議之訴提起云云、至此盛毓郵之代理人左德濤律師起稱、原告對通和提起執行異議之訴、對於盛毓郵有何請求、應令原告答覆、此為先决問題、庭上卽問陸律師對盛</p>
<p>有何請求</p>
<p>陸律師答稱、原告與通和本無關係、因通和受抵後、越俎代庖、出頭起訴、致原告受執行錯誤之損害、但系爭房屋之屬誰、究為盛氏之事、如盛不反對原告請求、當可撤回盛氏部分之訴、如盛氏不以原告主張為然、原告當然一併起訴、庭諭本案程序上尙有問題、且俟裁定後、再行傳訉、</p>

<p>（七）體育之重視該校因川省學生身體、素號文弱、故對於體育特加重視、專設體育指導委員會及體育部、負設計推行全校體育之責、本年該校會舉行各種球類比賽二次、春季運動會一次、並組各代表隊、隨時對外參加比賽、成績頗佳、至設備方面、除新建四百公尺跑圈二百餘公尺直跑道足球塲兩處、籃球塲八處、網球塲十二處、排球塲五處外、關於各種體育用器無不應有盡有、來年聞已聘定前在淸華以運動注名、而現在美國學習體育之黃中孚君來校担任體育主任、於體育之設施、必更有長足進步、</p>
<p>（八）西南社會科學研究處之組織</p>
<p>該校以四川地處西陲、社會情形、諸多特殊之點、亟應加以調查、以期發見事實、以供研究社會學者之參考、本期特組織西南社會科學研究處、就川省及西南邊境之經濟及民俗各問題、切實調查、並加研究、該處設顧問委員會、除該校各學院院長及秘書長為當然委員外、另聘國際聞名之勞工問題專家現任國立淸華大學教授陳通夫博士、國際公法專家現任武漢大學教授周鯁生博士、生物家專家現任中國科學社生物研究所所長胡先驟氏及社會學專家中央研究院社會研究所所長陶孟和氏等為委員、而以名經濟家南開大學商學院院長兼經濟研究所所長何廉博士為顧問委員會委員長、南開大學四川經濟調查團團員鮑覺民·葉謙吉·張鍚羊·谷源田四君為研究員、積極進行、已於上月赴灌郫等縣調查、聞不久卽將赴彭縣堂慶等處調查、</p>
<p>（九）民衆法律顧問處之設立</p>
<p>該校以法學院、素乏實騐材料、於了解社會治學方法、均感缺憾、本期特在法學院設立民衆法律顧問處、解答民衆法律上之質疑、藉便學生有所實　、而法律知識、亦得普及於一般民衆、自成立以來、社會人士極為稱許、來函請為指導或請教者、絡繹不絕、此該校為社會服務之一端也、</p>
<p>（十）課外活動之一斑該校對於各生課外活動、提倡頗力、如本年該校各科研究會之成立、亦各有相當成績、該校並聘音樂指導員數人、戲劇指導一人、指導學生研究音樂與戲劇、故該校音樂研究會及戲研究會、在本年表演數次、頗博得社會人士之好評、</p>
<p>總而言之、該校地處成都、物產豐富、生活程度較之沿江沿海為低、每生每期得百一二十元卽可、如稍節省、則每期百元、亦可敷用、如該校能續續發展、與國內各大學並駕齊驅、則該校自不失為西南學子求學之樂園也、</p>

<p>紗市趨堅、漲風狂暴、蓋以本月份僅剩明天一日營業矣、交貨新籌碼雖有六千包外、然多方準備大量收貨、據市塲言已向某銀行做妥押欵、數量殊巨、於是在本月再行拖進、市價乃節節前進、遠月亦被其牽動上騰矣、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、各月呈顯著上升之象、近期漲四·五角、拍至遠期、形勢緊張、漲八·九角、二盤以後、陳花飛躍、市態轉變、檯面緊張、據云證券帮曁某方面續來加碼、市塲傳言極盛、謂多方在銀行方面已將本月紗押欵做就、預備收貨、於是買氣極其為蓬勃、市盤步開步漲、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元七角至二元二·四·六·角、午後開盤承上午之漲力、繼續挺進、市上議論紛紜、本月趨勢愈挺、各月均漲一元外、二三盤仍堅、迨收盤近月略回平、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一元一角至九角、遠漲四·九角、查賣出梅記八百包、大孚七百包、德大六百包、源大一千一百五十包、錦昌一千五百五十包、合興一千五百包、永裕一千一百五十包、愼記三千二百包、益昶一千四百五十包、裕大一千二百五十包、振大一千三百包、經華丸百包、買進益記一千四百包、明德二千五百五十包、元一二千一百五十包、大昌成一千七百包、長豐二千四百五十包、潤康一千二百包、協成一千八百五十包、大昶一千七百包、泰昌八百五十包、一月間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>棉市陳棉飛騰、直綫上漲、局勢銳不可當、蓋以多方準備盡量收貸、自停止新買賣後、所有一般浮多之額、據市塲言亦被搜羅殆盡、可想籌碼之乾燥矣、至於散空尙呆守不動、昨日開盤、市塲惰况急變、賣者缺乏、市價盤盤跳躍、午後七·八月已漲破限價以上、宣告停拍、然買氣仍濃烈、八月二盤後未能開出、七月收盤未曾拍出，竟造成交易所空前紀錄矣、</p>
<p>近期花狂漲三元餘</p>
<p>標花前市開盤，美棉平平、漲一至五磅音、印棉在跌三羅比半至五羅比七五、市塲人心、在未開盤以前、多數看小、詛料陳花因籌碼乾枯、賣者缺乏、情態大變、猛跳八角半至一元一角半、來勢又見汹湧、新花跟漲二·三角、二盤以後、陳花勇往直前、漲力其念、新花無甚變遷、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元九角至二元七角遠期漲四角半至五角、午後開盤、七·八月再在騰一元半、為五十二元半、八月期漲六角、亦為五十二元五角、一齊漲過跟價以上、七月期二·三盤價勿動、八月期二盤以後未曾做出、宣告停拍、此種嚴重局勢、為歷來所罕見、結果陳花比上午收盤價再漲六角至一元半、遠期漲五分至一角、查賣出源興昌二千二百擔、益康二千三百擔、同和一千五百擔、通記一千八百擔、大孚一千四百擔、梅記二千一百擔、大豐二千三百擔、元一二千四百擔、益昶二千一百擔、生源四千八百擔、信誠三千六百擔、長豐二千八百擔、買進裕大一千四百擔、達記二千六百擔、明德一萬擔、合興六千八百擔、協成三千六百擔、大昶一千一百據、豐泰三千擔、晋康一千三百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3 id="c217">片面的貞節觀念 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 林文</p>
<p>貞節是什麽？貞節就是人類行為的標準，一個女人能够合於這個標準，不損人而利己，這是道德的；但是，這在男權擴張的時代，怎樣能够實現道德的建立呢？　在過去，——其實現在也是這樣，女子是男子的附屬品，妻子死了，甚至於一個不够滿足丈夫的慾望，丈夫便可以一而再，再而三的納妾與宿娼；女子，丈夫死了若不能滿足伊的慾望，也祗有勉强遏制，否則是很難得一般人的同情；這是完全在男權澎脹的立塲上壓迫着女性。我國有所謂「七出之條」的一條，確立了女子的貞節，專一伊們的肉體，這種觀念現時代依舊存在着！</p>
<p>現在，雖也有不少的人主張貞節須互相保守，它所造成的結果是怎樣？在表面上，似乎已驚破了男權澎脹的迷夢，激奮了人們現時代的思想；其實呢，這種預想的希望，儘去提仍，也是得不着普遍的實現！這是明白的，是因為女子們經濟的地位和生產能力的沒落，而發生必然的結果</p>
<p>在女子職業極端困難的中國社會裏的女子的生活往往要依賴男子，四此，女子便不能不迎合男子的需要，極力保持伊的貞節，所以，女子們的依賴性，就是鞏固男權某礎的力量，我們明白地知道，男權力量的制裁，無疑地，剝奪了女子們的自主力！</p>
<p>第二十七期　假使，女子們要澈底的打破這片面的貞節觀念，那非使出毅力，向着你們的前途奮鬥，以求經濟上的解放不可，不然，你所希望的結果，只有唾駡和冷笑，而不能得到何種的同情與援助！</p>
<h3 id="c218">暑期中的主婦生活 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>家庭，在暑期裏，可說得是一個特殊時期。做家庭中的主婦的，該對於家庭衛生，子女的管理，以及娛樂等問題，有相當的研究。</p>
<p>在暑期中，氣溫總是很高的，各種夏季疾病的細菌，都得到了很好的生存與繁殖的機會。在這時期中，飲食起居，偶一不愼，闔家的健康，便能給破壞無遺。從前，我會聽某夫人的演講，伊說，「我在家庭中的一半時間，幾乎完全是消費在家庭中的飲食上面的。凡是一切菜蔬的洗滌，烹調，都是我自己動手的，所以親戚們，都在背地裏議論我，說我勞碌命，雇着傭婦，連這一些事，還得自己幹。殊不知我有我的怪癖，對於傭婦們的貪懶行為，總是極度的不放心，更其是對於飲食物方面。所以在暑期中，就是熱一個菜，煮一壺水，我也非親自動手不可。雖然我這麽的不憚勞，也未見有驚人的成績，但是在十年中，全家沒會害過一次傳染病，雖在疫癘盛行的暑期中，我家也是毫無影響的，這總不能不說是對於我注意飲食衛生的報酬。」雖然伊說的話，是似乎很普通的，但我以為這眞是暑期中，卞婦的良箴，所以特為介紹。此外，如飲食的宣有調節，夜臥的不可過於貪凉，家庭用具的宜勤於洗滌，消毒，蚊蠅等有害昆虫，宜設法撲殺，而加以消滅等工作，自然都該由主婦負起重大資任來的。</p>
<p>子女在這暑假期中，該有規律而合理化的加以管理着，否則是會得流浪而成為野孩子的。我記得某夫人，對這問題，也會加以介紹過。伊說，「在孩子們的暑假中，我認為是孩子的智德體三育的最佳的訓練時期，所以在暑假中，每天早上五點左右，總催迫着他們離床。在七時左右，驅使他們在宅旁草地上，或公園中去遊玩，讓他們盡量的去運動。從九時起，命他們讀書，寫字，讀報作文。十二時午膳，下午任令他們稍稍散步，或游戲，至二時左右，使他們午睡。因時催醒他們，分配着他們工作，如擦窗，洗地板，或軋草等，的一小時，於是給他們洗澡休息，晚飯之後，帶着他們赴音樂會，或是觀電影，或是出外散步，或是上公園去納凉。在每年七八星期的暑假中，都是這樣的，所以我的孩子，在暑假中，非但學業不荒疏，反能有進步，而開學時的健康狀態，也總比了放假時優良。」能像某夫人那麽的對於女子，嚴格地管理，自然最好，若是不能完全學得像，那麽，就學着幾分之幾，也總比了完全不加管理的强。總之，暑假期中，雖然女子們，不用每天上學校，但是絕對不是放任子女度流浪生活之用的。道一點，為母親的，是該明瞭地認識的。</p>
<p>暑期中的娛樂問題，也是十分重要的。娛樂，是跟着家庭的生活環境，而不同的。所以在這裏，也不能加以具體的介紹。但有一點，是値得一提的，那是「娛樂不忘衛生。」若是對於衛生有妨的娛樂，須絕對的拒絕。最好的娛樂方法，是上海灘去洗海水浴，或到郊外去遠足，或招集幾位朋友，讀書說笑，或討論家庭問題，或開一個冷飲的同樂會等等，都是很好的暑期娛樂法。</p>
<h3 id="c219">印度的婦女 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 影天</p>
<p>如果你是一個智識份子的話，那麽你一定要說「早婚」是有關身體的發育，以及生理的毀傷，無疑的是一種不良的惡制度。印度人的婚姻，便是浸淫在這個環境裏，通常每一個印度婦人，在月經以前便得結婚了，因為宗教的迷信，月經在印度人的目光中是認為最不潔的東西，女人一有了月經，那便是伊們度婦女生活的開始了。至於他們早婚的起源，有兩種傳說：一，據說在古代印度聖書裏，已有讚美早婚的文字，因此，大家都熱烈地擁護着早婚。另一個傳說，說是距今半世紀以前，回回教侵入印度，印度教徒都把處子的女兒送在男性的庇護之下，早婚的惡習便因此而遺傳下來了。</p>
<p>雖然，好幾年前有個呌做沙卡」的印度人，提出修改早婚案，法律是成立的，而對普遍的民衆却還是得不到辦法　做一個印度人的妻子，誰都有生育過一個兒子的義務，如果結婚了三年而還沒有兒子，於是伊們便有被離的危險，根據這點弱點，在印度第一大都會「加爾谷脫」的郊外，有一所「喀利寺」，寺中說是有授子的菩薩，求子心切的婦女們，很多宿在寺裏希望在夢中得着神的兒子。半夜時，所謂「菩薩」者就出現了，授以「神之子」，於是，失去貞操的婦女，在印度是遍地皆是，這完全是一般僧人的罪惡！而更可笑的，便是這位「神之子」在父母的心目中是更其的鍾愛？</p>
<p>女人懷孕一到臨月，就被趕到一個小屋子裏，斷絕與外人往來，祇除了服侍的產婆之外，屋子裏無人洒掃，日久便污穢非凡。生產了，生的是男孩子，那是可以比較早些時候搬出這平屋，假如不幸生了個女孩子，那麽須住了好久的日子才能脫離這苦海。有的遇着難產，不知原理的無能為的產婆，竟拿着瓦片，或碎玻璃等的東西來施行手術，很多的產婦的生命，都喪失在這些可惡的產婆之手，嬰孩的死亡也不少。而有些懷孕的婦人，竟生活在充滿了牛糞臭的牛棚裏。</p>
<p>「寡婦殉夫」，是以前印度的一種野蠻之風。這種儀式，是在丈夫死後火葬時，寡婦把油塗遍了周身，縱身躍入了吐着火舌火窟裏，這種慘無人道的風氣，現在已由政府禁止了。然而，寡婦們的生活却像死去一樣；身上祇能披着一塊素白布，不能戴指環等等的首飾物，每天祇有一頓的進餐，最煩苦，最卑下的工作完全由伊們祖當着，在伊們這樣悽凉的生活中，一生便再也沒有瞧見伊們一笑的可能了。</p>

<h3 id="c221">魯沙白女士談日本的女性 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>賢妻良母是她們傳統的觀念　女權低落祇想嫁得如意郞君　受新思潮的女子有自覺傾向</p>
<p>我國留日學生中，有兩位女作家，新近在文壇上很落頭角，一是吳曼之，一是魯沙白，國內幾家雜誌，常見他們的作品，本刋也曾發表好多次，讀者如不健忘，當能記憶。吳女士我不曾見過，魯女士現寓海上，前天承友人介紹，和長談一小時，覺得她的思想很前進，學識很優超，於婦女及兒童問題，更有特殊興趣。那天談的話太多，這裏不過摘錄三點：（一）日本女性的檢討，（二）蘇聯女性的特點；（三）中國女性的出路。魯女士說：「像我這樣閱歷淺薄的人，對那麽大的問題，豈敢信口雌黃，貽笑大方！」我說：「你也不必客氣，新女性出言做事，膽子要大，纔是巾幗丈夫的氣概</p>
<p>日本女子在表面上看來，差不多個個有賢德，有婦道，是賢妻良母的典型，是勤儉耐苦的先鋒。然究其實際，她們在社會上毫無地位，簡直談不上有男女平權那麽一回事。日本眞是以男性為中心的社會，與歐美的情形，適得其反，這是傳統的思想，至今不曾能改變過來。但看日本的教育制度，男女截然不同的，日本女子的教育，嚴格的說，是奴隸化的教育！現代各國，大都男女受教育是平等的，男女同校，極為普遍，惟日本從無此例。小學或許男女同校，中等以上的學校，便絕無僅有的了。有幾個大學，雖然允許少數女生人學，但只能旁聽，不能當作正式生的。所有中等以上的女校，全是偏重家事學，什麽縫級，烹飪，看護，衛生等，此外是怎樣對待丈夫，教養兒童，卽如女子大學的教育系，也注重家政和兒童教育。還有花嫁學校，卽新娘學校，訓練女子待人接物的禮貌，服侍翁姑的方法，日本女子教育，雖然普及，而奴化式教育，怎能提高女子的地位呢？日本女子職業很發達，而操有實權地位桌超的，簡直一個也沒有。大多數女子，想嫁個有錢有勢的男子，過得安樂的生活，於願巳足，莫怪西洋人說世界上最落伍的女子，便算日本，這話不能說過分吧。在男子的心目中，以為日本女子的特長，在於性情溫柔，馴服，有禮貌能持家；但另一方面，日本女子氣量狹小，沒有僩性，只跟丈夫走，缺乏獨立平等的精神，也許是她們普遍的弱點吧。</p>
<p>話得說回頭來，日本女人能主持家政，生了小孩會自己教養，不假手於人，注重兒童教育，培養國家未來的新生命，這的確比我國女子强得多了。日本也有少數接受歐美新思潮的女子，也在反對現實的種種措施，但政府監視很嚴，不容你散佈新奇的種子。還有農村破產後的女人，擠到都市裏，要求生活，很有自覺的精神。日本屢次增兵東北及華北，把壯丁强迫送到前綫去，受盡苦痛的婦女，眼看妻離子散，生死莫下的景况，內心也够難受，常有表示反抗的行動，在此高壓之下，是無法可施的。</p>
<p>魯女士對蘇聯的女性，深致欽慕，不斷地在研究她們一切的問題，她說蘇聯眞是新興的國家，一切理論，都成現實，世界上男女眞正平等的，只有蘇聯一國。他們無論什麽事業，甚至於重工業，海陸空軍隊伍，到處都是男女性共同參加，一致活躍的。有些地方，女子的力量超過男子，這種偉大的，勞動的，獨立的精神，眞値得佩服。我希望中國的女性，也要模仿她們，大家有了愛國的思想，救國的情緒，我們還怕什麽？</p>
<p>她對於中國婦女的出路，表示如下的意見：「中國是次殖民地的國家，在沒有躋於獨立平等的地位以前，什麽問題，都很難解决，就現狀論：我以為中國婦女，應站在團結統一的旗幟之下，共同努力於民族復興運動，謀整個的出路，决不是少數人所可單獨進行的。我們女界，要如一個人有豐富的學識，優越的地位，只解决了一人的生活，與大衆的關係很少，倘如向下一看，便知道待解放的人，多如恒河沙數。在女子本身方面說，要自覺，要刻苦，認淸我是社會一份子，决不能視嫁人為自我的職業。男女處平等地位，各有共責任，我何必依靠男子？現社會一般女子，小學生想嫁中學生，中學生想嫁大學生；大學生想嫁留學生；這不啻自己降低地位，顯出依賴的心理，我不敢苟同，任何女子，必先克服種種弱點，纔能有為。」她並談到留東女生的情况，可分作兩類：（一）刻苦自勵的學生，抱定宗旨，為求學而來，精神可佩。（二）以留學混資格的，不管旅外的代價，只圖自己的虛名，還有不少東北各省的女同學，有的已忘了祖國，認賊作父，那是何等痛心的事！</p>
<p>魯女士原籍南海，生長廣州，在上海讀書多年，和謝冰瑩，陳波兒，王瑩，都是上海藝大的同學，留日已兩年，在東京法政大學攻社會學，她也愛好戲劇，游泳，排球等，近半年中，會在築地小劇塲主演過「一個女人一條狗」，「牧塲兄弟」；「嬰兒殺戮」等劇，有聲於時。她此番回國來，想看看離國兩年中社會的動熊，不久返日，再兩年畢業後，願致力於婦女遝動，以她那樣年富力强的新女子，前程一定很遠大的。</p>
<h3 id="c222">南通的農村婦女 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭康伯</p>
<p>我曾在申報月刊寫過一篇關於南通婦女生活之類的文章，在那篇文字裏，「我將南通的婦女分為三個等級來講；所謂三個等級，卽一·都市的享樂婦女，二。女學生，三·農村婦女，不過，這一篇文字內對於前二種婦女的生活狀况有着過度詳盡的描寫，而對於農村婦女的日常生活情形的報導郤是略而又略的；在寫這篇文章以後，會得到一個機會編輯了一個時期的婦女刊物，因了這項工作，使我對南通婦女生活的情形有了更進一步的了解，尤其關於農村的婦女方面。所以特在這裏作一個補充的叙述。</p>
<p>倘以比例的方法來算，則南通的農村婦女其數量是要佔全南通婦女的總數的三分之二的：這一羣農村婦女談起伊們所受的教育是要使人異常地失望的，在伊們之間，受過義務教育的人便是算受過最高教育的人，通常都是目不識丁的多，在私塾裏坐過一二年冷板凳的女子便可以誇耀於鄉里的。目前，除了近城市一帶的鄕村外，窮鄉僻壤間，截髮放足之風氣是仍未深入的。這一帶婦女的如常生活除了縫紉，烹煮之外，農忙的時候，伊們也是一羣很好的助手，往年，南通大布還旺銷的時候，農村間的男婦們都以織布為副業，而且日以繼夜地工作着，所以一個勤勞的婦女每天勤作的結果也可得到半元以上的報酬，可是，自南通大布沒落以後，這一注豐富的收入便無端地喪失了。在今日南通的農村，卽使有幾畝薄田的自耕農亦難生存的今日，一羣處於高利貸的剝削下的小佃農們，便都毫不顧惜地將他們的妻女趕向都市中去了，普通都在一般中產階級的家庭中充當侍役（在南京稱老媽子）這一類婦女每月所得到的報酬的自一元至二元，連「外快」收入好的的可得三四元，但普通都在三元以下</p>
<p>童養媳制度在今日南通的鄉間仍極盛行，一般無相當產業的人在生下子弟以後，便輾轉謀一個童養媳，甚至也有的是一指腹為婚的，童養媳長成後在二十歲以前便都完婚了，婚後有的還相安度日，有的便發生異變，故背井離鄉等新聞是常充寒於閭里間的。</p>
<p>南通農村嫦女的特種行業也還多，普通的便是販賣菓品或食物，遇到節令，便採集了一切應時的或應景的物品出賣，以博取蠅頭之利。有的體格較强的婦女，常來城市間推貨車或挑貨，百斤左右的重車重擔伊們都會挑得起推得動，而且還會健步如飛。</p>
<p>一年四季，伊們都是在苦難的生活中磨煉着的，每年的新春正月，是伊們比較愉快而輕鬆的季節，而且在物質享受方面，亦以這個季節為豐盛，其它，每年秋冬之間的迎神賽會？伊們雖也可痛快一下，但那只是一兩天的狂歡而已。</p>
<h3 id="c223">中國古代巾幗詩人的哀怨　（一） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>生離，死別，懷春，遲暮，</p>
<p>失戀，遺棄，非耦，喪亂。</p>
<p>自古美人多薄命，才人亦多薄命。但看歷代巾幗詩人的文學作品中，含着幾多哀怨，便可想見其遭遇的不幸和內心的痛苦。女子哀怨的分析，不外生離，死別，懷春，遲慕，失戀，遺棄，以至非耦之怨，喪亂亡國之怨等等。這是人情所同，今古一轍的。</p>
<p>生離之怨</p>
<p>悲莫悲兮生別離，樂莫樂兮新相知，屈大夫已經一語道破。詩詞中離別之什，幾乎占了最高的成數，眞是不可以僂指計。尋常的離別之怨，寫得最委婉動人的，要推漢朝蘇伯玉妻的盤中詩：</p>
<p>「山樹高，烏嗚悲；泉水深，鯉魚肥；空倉雀，常苦饑；吏人婦，會夫稀。出門望，見白衣，謂當是，而更非。還入門，中心悲。……常嘆息，當語誰？君有行，妾念之。出有日，還無期。結巾帶，長相思。君忘妾，未知之；妾忘君，罪當治。……家居長安身在蜀，何惜馬蹄歸不數！……」</p>
<p>盤中詩不過是惜別的代表作。至於眞正的生離之什，哀感纏結，沁人心脾的，要推王昭君出塞的悲思之歌，蔡文姬的胡笳十八拍，宋朝周仲美的題壁詩。</p>
<p>王昭君的故事，是誰都知道的。她以一個嬌弱美貌的女子，初不得寵於漢宮，後乃選派為匈奴國氏，遠適異邦，舉目無親。她的心中該是怎樣的悲哀呢！怨詩雖短短百字，而畢生遭遇，盡在紙上。</p>
<p>「秋木萋萋，其葉萎黃，有烏處山，集於苞桑，養育毛羽，形容生光。旣得升雲，上游曲房，離宮絕曠，身體摧藏，志念抑沉，不得頡頏。雖得委食，心有徊徨。我獨伊何，來往變常，翩翩之燕，遠集西羗。高山峨峨，河水泱泱，父兮母兮，道里悠長。嗚呼哀哉，我心惻傷！」</p>
<p>蔡文姬以一代文宗的名父之女，遭逢國家多難，初被胡人所擄，別父遠離，為左賢王后。在胡十二年，生了兩個兒子。後得牘回漢土，親生二子，不獲俱行。復嫁為陳留董祀妻。我們看她去漢入胡時的悲怨：</p>
<p>「越漢國兮入胡城，亡家失身兮不如無生！氈裘為裳兮骨肉震驚；羯羶為味兮枉遏我情。　鼓喧兮從夜達明。胡風浩浩兮暗塞營。……（三拍）</p>
<p>「……天災國亂人無主，唯我命薄兮歿戎虜。殊俗心異兮身難處；嗜慾不同兮誰可與語！」（四拍）</p>
<p>「為天有眼兮何不見我獨漂流！為神有靈兮何獨處我天南北海頭！我不負天兮天何使我殊配儔！我不負神兮神何殛我越荒州！……」（八拍）</p>
<p>她身居異域，所可慰者祇有親生的兩個兒子。及去胡歸漢，母子骨肉分離，哀痛逾恒</p>
<p>「……身歸國兮兒莫之隨，心懸懸兮常如饑。……山高地闊兮見汝無期！……」（十四拍）</p>
<p>「子母分離兮意難任，同天隔越兮如商參。生死不知兮何處尋，！……（十五拍）</p>
<p>「……去時懷土兮心無緒；來時別兒兮思漫漫！……（十七拍）</p>
<p>在她的「悲憤詩」中，把她始來遭遇，披瀝肝腸的描寫出來，令人讀之生出無限酸楚。古今女子遭遇不幸的生離哀怨之作，當以此為絕唱了。</p>
<p>周仲美初隨父親遊宦至成都，嫁了一個姓李的丈夫，從夫官金陵。後來丈夫有了寵妾，家庭不和，棄官入華山不歸。仲美携子寄居合肥外祖家，求歸不得。會舅任長沙，俱載而南，因書所懷於壁：</p>
<h3 id="c224">棄妾 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>大槪是天氣太熱的緣故，松大爺今天的火勁似乎也比往常大了許多，一張假紅木的小茶几被他拍得上下左右，全在吱吱格格地響着，差一些就要在他的手掌之下送命了</p>
<p>松大爺弟兄一共有五位，他老人家最長，所以闔家的人都稱他松大爺。松大爺的老子三太爺在日，當過幾任電政監督，很有些積蓄，大太太之外，還娶着兩房姨太太。松大爺和桃二爺是大太太養的，來路最正，因此權勢也最大；三爺四爺是大姨太養的，雖然大姨太是早就死了，但這兩位爺在外面混得很好，所以在家庭裏也還有着相當的地位；五爺最小，是二姨太養的，一下地三太爺就死，所以在松大爺桃二爺的眼裏，五爺眞是像小貓小狗一樣不値一顧的東西。可是在二姨太的心裏，伊自從十七歲嫁給三太爺，低頭服小的耐了九年工夫，好容易生着這一個兒子，怎不巴望將來當個倚靠呢？所以在三太爺初喪期內，為着謝帖上的名字，麻衣的粗細，二姨太着實和松大爺爭吵過一番。</p>
<p>三太爺一死，松大爺就是一家之主了二姨太這樣和他爭吵，如何能使他不動氣呢？而且不僅如此，在松大爺的算盤上，將來分起遺棄來，五爺是一定沒有份的，經不起二姨太一吵，謝帖上有了他的名字，將來便不能沒有問題了。所以松大爺不但動氣，簡直「怒從心上起，惡向胆邊生」，恨不能立刻將二姨太和五爺處死，無奈淸明世界，衆目昭彰，怎能下此毒手呢！沒法只得暫時隱忍，徐圖良策。</p>
<p>過了幾時，松大爺的良策果然想出來了。</p>
<p>有一天，松大爺和桃二爺竟在二姨太房裏捉出了個野漢來，雖然這人並不曾裸體赤足，二姨太自己又哭天呌地的喊寃枉，但松大爺却認定這人確是伊的姦夫，立刻在客堂裏拍檯拍脚的大罵起來，堅持着要把二姨太驅逐出去。家裏的人勸的勸，笑的笑，無非總偏向着松大爺；二姨太旣沒有娘家的人可以帮忙，又不懂得怎樣可以利用法律來剖白自己的寃枉，經不起松大爺等一味的威逼，竟只得任他們處置，怱忽收拾了一個斗大的包裹，丟下了伊那還在哺乳時期的愛子，一把眼淚，一把鼻涕的哭出去了。</p>
<p>第二天晚上，松大爺路過文康橋，瞧有許多人圍着一個剛從河裏撈上、的女屍在大驚小怪地議論着，松大爺不用回頭去看，心上是早已明白了。</p>

<p>德國科學發明，甲於全球，醫藥進步，世罕其匹，對於淋病療治，淋藥選擇，苦心孤詣以研究者，大不乏人，最近Dr.Jadassohn博士發表根治淋病而欲兼保子，須透膜殺菌與增加抵抗力並重，殺菌劑之最王道者，首推黃色素Acridn，增加抵抗力則以伐克辛Vaccin（菌苗）為最良，博士本此心得，悉心研究，最後始發明內服黃色素伐克辛之合製「安敵淋」Antirrhea，服後有注苗之功，而無注射之弊，全身抵抗力頓形健全，淋菌無由流竄，局部病灶，回復原來組織，淋菌無法存跡，至其消炎滅毒，退腫鎭疼，防腐生新，利尿淨濁等功能，有為舊日淋藥所不及，愈後不再復發，檢騐淋菌絕跡，精虫依然活潑，子嗣毫無妨碍，根治之目的旣達，生育之本能亦健，誠淋濁病家之福音，淋藥中之聖品也。</p>

<p>編輯先生：當我寫這封信的辰光，不知費去了幾許的考慮，躊躇了再三，倒底因為心理上的羞慚敵不上痛苦的襲擊，終於鼓足了我的勇氣，毫不隱瞞地將我的病源和盤托出。」先生我啻認你是我唯一的救星了，因為我的病轉輾遷延自己嘗受了三年的痛苦。現在呢？已經有些回蘇之望了，也許生命可以保存吧！？」很慚愧，我是有自瀆惡癖的青年，一個有為的青年會什麼要這樣自暴自棄呢？先生！請你不要這樣來責我。因為這樣，我是要無地自容了。」幹這樣的勾當，遠在三年之前，歸根結底，是被淫書所害喲！當初發那可怕的遺精，差不多每夜不斷向我的生命肉搏，我因此遍求醫藥的補救，想要拿我的生命來保存，所以曾經請專門醫師的診治，並且服過主治遺精神效的「希米脫氏固精片」，居然被根治好了，不過我想「希米脫氏固精片」，遺精雖然迅速地被它治好了，不過我想「希米脫氏固精片」遺精雖然迅速地被它治好，但是神經衰弱症，依然這樣猖獗，據朋友說，因為精液太浪費的緣故，所以生殖腺被它摧殘了，並且介紹我一種藥，據說可以挽回生殖腺的旺盛，藥名呌得「生殖素」所以我為鄭重起見，不得不將我的病來公開一下，請先生代我決斷吧！希望馬上得一個答覆！王介塵謹上，</p>
<p>（簡答）：遺精旣已治愈，生命可保無虞，但切宜戒除手淫，尊友所推薦之「生殖素」，確可培補精血，挽回衰頹，可向華美藥房放心購服，一切神經衰弱症自可治根也。（編者答）</p>

<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>民國廿五年底。為戒煙最後之期限。亦卽煙民之末日。如仍玩忽功令。則政府惟有視同棄民。不恤以極刑相加矣。近來各地常有煙犯毒販受死刑之處分。可見政府禁烟除毒之決心。凡我病家。如因病痛而吸烟成癮。或戒時病患湧現而中途廢止。其狀可憐。其情可憫。但如不及早回頭。則死刑之降臨。直時間問題耳。</p>
<p>戒烟非難事。難在安全。安全之要旨。在去其病患。治其衰弱。除其煙毒。斷其烟癮。欲求此四者齊備之戒烟良劑。惟「生殖素」堪稱巨擘。良以其功效宏偉。洵戒煙者福音也。</p>

<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>星神經衰弱一症。患者日多一日。其習見者。以遺精，早洩，陰痿爲最。一時有通病之目。患者以青年爲特多。良以世風日下。道德淪亡。人慾横流。刺戟孔多。最易引起性神經之疾患也。</p>
<p>遺精多由手淫過度而起。患者輸精管鬆弛。略一感引。即自遺洩。治法主在固精。以「希米脱氏固精片」爲最良。藥性王道。適合華人體質。用治遺精夢洩等症。克奏奇功。惟遺精治後。用「生殖素」補精爲尤要。</p>
<p>早洩除手淫外。凡房勞過度者。亦易罹之。其病根在生殖腺之衰弱。故治法自以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」爲最效。</p>
<p>陰痿者。腎弱而局部萎縮之謂也。其病源雖有先天與後天之分。但其生殖腺素之缺乏則一。故治法亦以内服「生殖素」爲最對症。</p>
<p>（一）遺精得救！</p>
<p>患者許君：少犯手淫。旦旦而伐。斵喪過度。精枯腦弱。形成遺精失眠等症。迭藥未效。困苦難言。經余介紹向永安公司購服「希米脱氏固精片」以固精。並服「生殖素」以補精。連服月許。所患即除。回復壯健云。</p>
<p>（二）早洩痊愈！</p>
<p>患者穆君：結婚過早。不知自節。致性能毁傷。罹有早洩之苦。神經衰弱狀百出。困頓難堪。除介紹向詹念曾醫師處施行電療外。並投服「生殖素」。服未半打。早洩即愈。回復壯健。重萌生機云。</p>
<p>（三）陰痿霍然！</p>
<p>患者鍾君：秉賦素弱。疾病孔多。調理失當。發育不全。局部纖小。自介紹向詹念曾醫師施行電療外。並囑服「生殖素」以資發育。全身肌肉立見壯茁。局部亦頓復壯觀。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>

<h3 id="c233">各國樹白旗之後將怎樣？ <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日我在增刋上寫了「各國高懸休戰白旗」一篇文字之後，意猶未盡，茲再述之。</p>
<p>國聯方面（其實就是英法）深恐不撤消制裁，在德意聯盟，將成事實，而集體安全之制，勢必瓦解，不料撤消制裁，而德意的形勢，更形接近，國聯不免上了意國的大當，其實英法諸國，未必不知此種情形，卽使撤消制裁，原未必能挽回集體安全之運命，但不撤消制裁，而事實上决議制裁的各國中，已有數國為意國虛聲所懾服，並不履行其義務，制裁的陣綫，本已動搖，是以撤消難，不撤消亦難，不若撤銷，一以消滅目前之危機，二則稍留餘地，以冀恢復舊日之感情也。</p>
<p>事業之成敗，用兵之勝負，本屬平常，所可怕的，便是失敗之後，看看戰勝國驕恣的狀態，與冷嘲熱諷的口吻，其受刺激最深，卽如此次各國撤消對意制裁之日，墨索里尼雜以笑聲的演說，謂全世界參加對意制裁辦法之各國，咸於是日在其制裁陣綫之壁壘上，高懸休戰白旗，此種語帶譏諷而兼挑撥性之演詞，在一般參加對意制裁之各國聞之，何等刺心而難堪，我人對於此事所得之教訓，卽是處現代的世界，任何一國，非蠻幹不能成事，亦非蠻幹不能自衛，我若退一步，敵人必進一步，我若退十步，敵人必進十步，結果必窮無立錐之地而後已。</p>
<p>墨索里尼這樣驕傲而非笑的演說，在樹白旗的諸國聞之，就此吃癟而已乎？還是欲想法以解除此魔難也，這是天然，任何弱小國家，任何小動物，必定有一些反抗性，决不會無影無踪，任人宰割，任人欺凌，而不一拔刀相向，而况英法本是超等强國，决不會就此一籌莫展，任入擺佈，幷且看德意兩國目前的姿態，其野心很是勃發，不是這樣已算止境，故英法之對付德意，不僅已往之屈辱，當想法報復，而未來的大難，也須得預防。</p>
<p>現在英法兩國將用什麽方法去應付當前與未來的局勢呢？這眞是值得研究的問題，歐洲列强之中，除了德意外，其他都是小國，卽使結合，亦决不能與德意抗衡，此外美俄兩國，與英法宗旨相同，而實力亦比較雄厚，但是兩國形格勢禁，地利上旣多隔閡，幷且俄則一旦有事於歐洲，深恐日本之搗其後，而美則素抱門羅主義，對於歐洲大局，本來不願意顧問，故環睹列强之中，竟無可與携手者，如是英法兩國卽欲用縱橫捭闔之策，亦勢有所不能。</p>
<p>然則英法兩國將絕對沒有辦法麽？是又不然，他們處這樣環境之下，非但當前之難關，無法應付，而未來之局勢，更是緊張，這樣接二連三困難問題的襲擊，多是警告現在的世界，决不是安富尊榮，席豐履厚的局面，不是捭闔縱橫，虛聲恫喝所能有濟，非自强不足以圖存，非自力不足以自救，惟有埋頭苦幹，極力擴張軍備，準備着他日在海陸空陣綫上爭個你死我活而已，此外更有何可想呢！故現在的局勢，多是在造成第二次大戰的根苗。</p>

<p>— 稼遷</p>
<p>小河浜里來了一條捕魚的小船，像普通的艒艒船一樣，是終年在水上飄泊為家的。他們是老夫婦兩個，說他們是老夫婦，那是從他們終年被生活所磨折，沒有好的營養，沒有好的衣着，那形成的外表所給我們的估計而已。或許他們正壯年呢。</p>
<p>雖然那小河浜的支流剛從這里開始，但是市集已經至此為止了。再從這里沿支流而下，是這地方的荒墳，除了時常有二個人抬一口棺木從這里經過，再沒有其他的過路人了，那條漁舟似乎很滿意他們找到了這樣適合的一個地方。幾矢之後，他們見沒有人來干涉他們的捕魚生涯，（他們是時常會碰到那樣無理的驅逐的）他們漸漸地從水上移居到陸上了。他們在地上植起了竹竿，用一條繩子縛着，曬起他們破碎的衣服；在水浜邊挖了一個洞，放着他們的行灶。除了睡覺，他們的日常生活完全搬到地上來了。</p>
<p>他們每天捕捉兩次魚，潮來和潮落的時侯。他們有一片很大的魚網，背着潮水的方向娘在河底，夫婦兩個就跑到很遠的河心中，潮水高漲時候，僅見兩個人頭在水面土浮勤。他們兩支手里都執着三角形的一竿，一邊慢慢地把身體在河心中移　，一邊掉動着兩根三角形</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的竹竿，向張着魚網的方向起去。因為全身體都浸在水中，體重失了均衡，河心的石子，玻璃屑又常常刺痛他們的脚底，趕一網魚，至少要半小時以上。等到他們像水鬼一樣從河心爬起來時，他們是沒有片刻的餘閑顧慮到他們的身體，他們要迅速地把魚網收起來，否則，他們半小時的努力完全白費了的。那片魚網放下去時候是很容易的，收的時候網里已有了大量的收獲，有時沉在河底的破爛的東西也常常和魚一起趕在網里，而且又背着潮水的推進力，他們站在船頭上用力彎着身體把網收起來，那條小船彷彿不勝擔負似的時常把船尾直了起來。看着他們的收網，我總想起那年在海邊上目睹一條漁舟被巨浪吞沒了的悽痛的情形。</p>
<p>一大網的魚堆在船頭上了。那些跳躍着的閃光的魚鱗，在他們夫婦的目光中放出了希望的雲彩。現在他們該是忘了身上的濕衣服了，他們高興地拉開網口，把大魚小魚分別養在桶里，手續是那樣迅速，沙屑石塊都隨手拋在河心里，卜通卜通的聲音連接着。於是，他們臉上塗着笑容，換了衣服上市街喚賣了</p>
<p>但是收起一大網的破爛東西也並不在少數，費去了半小時的努力他們自然感到很大的失望的。然而他們不怕辛苦，馬上又到河底去張網了，因為不能放過短時期的潮水的力量。</p>
<p>晚餐是他們最愉快的時候了：老頭（我們祇能這樣稱呼他，雖然他自己說過是三十八歲）打了一瓶酒，買一點猪頭肉，或者燒着他們自己打來的小魚，夫婦兩個吃着晚餐。有時我們也可以聽到那老頭喝着他們家鄉的私情山歌。</p>
<p>看他們網魚似乎已經成了習慣了，我幾乎每天帶着弟弟上小河浜去。但是沒有半個月，那條漁船被警察押送出境了，據說有人向警察署報告，說他們翻動河身，妨害開河局三年一次的開河工程，而且影響市民的飲水衛生。</p>
<p>我想着如果這兩欵罪狀成立時，老夫婦倆該關到牢里去，押送出境眞是太便宜的處罰！但是他們不能在陸地上捕魚，他們是以永為家的，不，以水為生的，那末，他們向什麽地方去捕魚呢？這問題苦惱了我許多時候，那兩張樸實的臉也時常在我眼前浮現着。</p>
<h3 id="c236">開工 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 艾茶</p>
<p>一條熱鬧的馬路，靠近十字路口的一排古舊的樓房，其中有一間已掛上了「陽光電版所」的招牌，六月的太陽像火球似的照射着，那剛刷過灰水的門面反映出了奪目的光彩。</p>
<p>這一間電版所里三個小老板都是朋友，他們正在慢慢散散地去準備着開工，可是，六月的太陽光熱得使人頭昏，尤其是設在露台上的工塲，太陽光火似地曬着用鋅鐵搭成的頂蓋，里面充滿了的酸臭的藥味跟刺人心臟的消鏹味，這多種氣味跟太陽的烈燄打成了一氣，使人一嗅到就窒息起來。</p>
<p>這時候還沒有開工，可是，三個老板的意見就紛岐了。那股本佔了多數的老陳，一個尖頭尖嘴的傢伙，歪着腦袋的望着他們兩個。三個人的眼珠子都定定地望着太陽。</p>
<p>「隔壁那家電版所只做五點紙。（註一）我們却做六點紙。」</p>
<p>司理財務的老陳這樣地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「有什麽辦法呢？省城有三十多家電報所。可是，做到五點紙一吋實在是虧本的，藥水都起了價，西紙匯水又很高，鋅版從五塊半漲到八塊錢啦：照最低的限度計算，每吋報成本也要三點多紙。浪費一點就要四點紙，還要伙食，店租，其他，眞的，能賺得伙食錢就好了！」</p>
<p>這是小劉那一張有經騐的嘴說的。</p>
<p>老錢霎霎眼晴，很有把握地說：</p>
<p>「我以為，你在店里沒有工作做，只看看數，我們兩個却製版，薪水啦，你也有一份兒。那麽，最好的辦法是你袒任義務寫畫，凡光顧五十吋版以上者贈寫普通字畫—其實，你單靠寫廣告晝也有四五十塊錢的收入呀！」</p>
<p>「我也願意，不過：我寫義務畫，我的生意也少了。」</p>
<p>老陳有點兒不快意地說着，抽了一口烟。</p>
<p>「那末！我們的條件也得改變了一點！」老錢這樣說，心里滿是為自已打算的慾望：「我是祖任攝映部的專門技師！我除了攝映的部分工作外，製版的工作我可不必管，而且我的薪水倒比任何人多一點才對，因為，我的股本錢也不少！」</p>
<p>「那有這樣的事呀！」小劉在怒吼地的呌着，那兩塊顴骨現得更要高一點了：「你攝映是不要緊，但你不製版可不對，你知道製版的工作比攝映多了五倍呀！你要享福嗎？還要說薪水比人多一點，現在述有多少生意。也不知道呀！生意不容做，你還說什麽薪水呢？」</p>
<p>小劉的眼也有了火燄地閃着。繼續說下去：</p>
<p>「我跑馬（註二）也比你多薪水呀！我打三十元工，你只打二十元工呀！眞眞……」</p>
<p>這樣，他的心里倒悔恨那時候拉老錢合辦這間電版所了。那一幕一幕的思潮起伏着：「我眞不要幹下去了，我也不去接生意了，這樣的糾紛，我還是讓牠倒閉了還要好。」</p>
<p>三個人的心事在浪濤里跳躍着，太陽正在睜大了眼睛地照着大地，他們共同地戚到太陽的光彩的權威，悄悄地嘆了一口氣了。</p>
<p>陽光電版所在各人的私見底下，終是開工了，每個人都有着心事，老陳拚命地去寫自己的廣告畫，企圖得到多一點的收入，老錢，這專門技師倒有點急，因那舊的映機不是很容易的。化了好多精神，才映出了不是上等品的照片，小劉對于工作方面完全是馬馬虎虎的，生意來得少，起版（註三）起得慢，這樣的支持下去，沒有一點兒起色，而且顯出了冷淡的氣色來了，（待續）</p>

<p>— 萊</p>
<p>關於米高梅公司攝製中國影片「大地」情形，本刊前已略有紀載，茲又獲得若干有關該片的消息，特譯錄於下。</p>
<p>「大地」的攝影塲設在距離洛杉機地數里的地方，有着中國式的村莊，幾間草屋，恪如中國內地所能見着的一樣。還有用水牛轉勸的磨坊，和用人力液溉內地的水車，五百多英畝的地裏種着麥子和稻子卷心菜等農產物。據說這些田地完全是由一個年紀很老的華僑農夫以祖國的土法耕種的。</p>
<p>主角王龍由保羅牟尼飾演，他穿着草鞋，肥大的藍竹布長衫，腰束着一根紅色綢布的長帶，頸後邊掛了一條小辮子。</p>
<p>飾阿蘭的是路然雷娜女士，她打扮得奇形性狀的，不大像賽珍珠女士書中所描寫的阿蘭</p>
<p>配角中有好多從我國扮了去的農人們和他們的妻子。拍攝時，有幾個農人還趕着從他們故鄉帶來的水牛，共中有個六十七歲的老頭兒—李長福，還有一位舊金山粤人福利會的會長，他是一個喜歡演戲的有身價的人。</p>
<p>另外還有一個値得一提的女演員，那是隸屬於中國籍的劉露德女士。她父親是中國人，現供職於國民政府，她母親却是美國人，面型是東方式的，說的是英國語，一個純粹美國味的十丸歲的少女，飾的角色是荷花，穿着短襖，肥大的褲子，揷了滿頭的花，活像中國蘇州型的妓女。</p>
<p>「大地」是値得注意的，因為它雖打着依據賽珍珠女士原著而編製劇本的旗號，若從過去的事實以及現在正在進行中形形色色觀察，無疑的將會成功一部辱華的影片，最少限度，也是不會怎樣對中國討好的。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The original text of the telegram from Huang Guangrui, the Commander of the Guangdong Air Force, and others is as follows: (Titles omitted) "China is plagued by disasters, and foreign insults come frequently. Liaoshen collapsed first, and Rehe fell after that. Suiyuan and Chahar, and North China, are like meat on a chopping block, in a precarious situation. Recently, the Southwest raised the banner of resisting Japan and saving the country, a seemingly grand and righteous reason, but the military orders have not yet been unified, and the national strength has no way to be concentrated. Speaking lightly about foreign affairs only reveals flaws, what benefit is there to the country? What is even stranger is that certain military personnel from a certain province have arrived together recently, this kind of situation is even unbearable to witness. Guangrui and others have served for many years, who among the soldiers in service are not comrades-in-arms? This change has happened, but they are powerless to reverse the situation, and they have no place to put their shame. They believe that Guangdong is the Guangdong of the Chinese people, and a single hair should not be moved rashly. Can one expect to win a gamble on a single throw? Rather than the snipe and clam holding each other, benefiting the fisherman, how about the wagtails helping each other in times of crisis and establishing the foundation for resisting insults? Therefore, on July 18th, they supervised and ordered the entire army to gather in Shaoguan, respectfully awaiting the orders of the Central Government, to avoid the party beans burning the stalk. It is neither because we were instigated by others nor because we have any intentions. What is home to a man? It is not about fame and wealth. We humbly report, awaiting your enlightened instruction. Air Force Commander Huang Guangrui and all officers and soldiers kowtow together. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">London Talks and the Future of British Diplomacy <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>What are the diplomatic achievements of British Prime Minister Baldwin in the past six months? In a nutshell: He sold out Abyssinia, ruined the prestige of the League of Nations, and damaged the honor of Britain. The Conservative Party, with the means of a coward, abandoned the policy of collective security, while still using the most beautiful slogans to realize the advocacy of military expansion. We see the spokespersons of the Conservative Party saying that the "binding force of force" will replace the "binding force of law," that disarmament will make Britain's actual strength unable to fulfill its moral authority, that collective security must be backed by force and must delineate regions and narrow scope, and that Britain's military actions thereafter must be guided by the spirit of the League of Nations. Such embellishments cannot conceal their conspiracies. The Treaty of Versailles was already trampled upon by Germany in the past, and the League of Nations collapsed after the lifting of sanctions. How to guard against the most ambitious and greedy Germany in Europe, and how to guard against the most ambitious and impoverished Japan in Asia—these are the problems that the Conservative Party is currently encountering and should devise countermeasures for. Regarding methods to deal with the former two countries, although the important figures within the British Conservative Party hold slightly different aspirations, we can still see their consistent tendencies from all sides. Mussolini has steadily taken Abyssinia, and like Hitler regarding the Saar, he declared that he is satisfied and that he will maintain the original state of Africa in the future. No one can guarantee whether this is true, but it is obviously a not-small sedative for short-sighted Conservatives. Conservative Party leaders such as Churchill, Austen Chamberlain, and the like hope to restore the so-called Stresa Front, to bring Mussolini into the previous group, to make Italy the guard of the Brenner Pass, and to prevent Germany from peeking into the Danube region again. This is what they yearn for. Due to Italy's intercession, Germany and Austria established a friendship agreement. What is its significance in international terms? What is the meaning within it? Is it as the treaty superficially indicates, and is it exactly as Britain hopes? These are all future questions, not something that can be predicted now. However, we can see many praising comments in the British Conservative Party's newspapers regarding the signing of this treaty, just like Italian newspapers are trying their best to praise the diplomatic victory completed by their prime minister. This shows that they do not mind Italy giving them the hat of "dishonor," and they are not afraid of Italy's formation of the fascist camp. From another perspective, the British Conservatives have long regarded Germany differently. The Conservatives argue that European problems would lose their importance without Germany's participation, and that Britain can only compromise with Germany to maintain its northern security. They therefore loudly proclaim that the Treaty of Versailles was a product of foolishness and that Germany is an international outcast. To satisfy Germany, it must have colonies. Such advocacy for the Germans naturally makes Germany prostrate itself. Although the Germans' ambitions are well-known to the British, and Germany recently rebuilt its navy on Heligoland, which will make Britain's northern border feel the threat of the German strong navy as it did during the Great War, the Conservatives would rather have a roaring "Nazi" heading east than a Soviet Union calling for collective security coming west. Peace is not something they value very much.</p>
<p>As for East Asia, the Conservative Party maintains its old ways in diplomacy without change. A few years ago, the famous lawyer and former Foreign Secretary Simon once exhausted his responsibility to defend the ambitious country in the East at the League of Nations, creating an irreversible situation in East Asia. Thus, that ambitious country went from Dong Province to Rehe and then to North China. The target is not only in the East Asian continent, but even has the potential to sweep Australia, rush towards Malaya, and reach the Red Sea directly. The old empire also became uneasy and hurriedly expanded the base in Singapore. Recently, an additional two million pounds have been allocated for adding to the defense. A strong navy will be stationed in Singapore to cooperate with detachments from British India, New Zealand, and Australia. This shows that they have become aware of the danger of being bitten back by the "friendly country" they previously nurtured and the necessity of prior defense. The military posture is defensive. The economic posture, such as Australia's recent increase in import taxes on Japanese goods, is also defensive. But the diplomatic posture is really strange; it is trying to compromise. The search by Lothian for a British-Japanese compromise in China goes without saying. The other day, in the British House of Lords, Lord Newton, the former Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, tried his best to defend Japan, saying that Japan had suffered poor treatment from Europe for forty years, leading to the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the mistaken belief in rumors, interfering in the Manchurian Incident, etc., expressing his regret. And the current Minister of Public Works, Lord Stanhope, also seems to regret not being able to conclude a treaty satisfactory to Britain, China, and Japan. International politicians are like merchants, taking the pursuit of profit as the only principle of their policies. Seeking to maintain their remaining interests from the most practical point of view, wouldn't international events get worse and worse, finally heading towards an irreversible situation?</p>
<p>Today, the policy of the British Conservative Party seems to be making such a mistake: seeking peace from bayonets and extracting practical benefits from gunpowder. Peace sometimes comes to an end, and practical benefits sometimes run out. When peace ends and practical benefits run out, then the inevitable result is a great uproar, followed by.</p>

During the meeting, in addition to reviewing the impact and shortcomings of Japan's past implementation of the southern advance policy, discussions will also be held on the attitude Japan should take towards China after the resolution of the Southwest issue and the completion of central unification, as well as future policies and how to establish concrete measures for deeply penetrating various provinces in South China. Therefore, this meeting is worthy of attention. (China United Press, 24th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Smuggled goods from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway flow south in a steady stream. However, due to the strict investigation by the Xuzhou Station Customs, they dare not transport them openly. Recently, they are mostly unloading goods at small stations in Jiangsu and Shandong and then transporting them by rickshaw to various counties in northern Jiangsu, causing smuggled goods to abound in remote and impoverished counties on the border between Jiangsu and Shandong, which has a significant impact on domestic goods.

The water head arrived at Lugou Bridge on the night of the 23rd, and the water level gradually rose from there, reaching the highest record of 1.8 zhang by 7:00 AM on the 24th.

<h3 id="e30">Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Provinces and Cities Have Completed Petitioning in Nanjing <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The petitioning delegation of chambers of commerce from twenty-one provinces and cities arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th and gathered at the Chamber of Commerce. Luo Qinghua, Yan Esheng, and Ge Jechen from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Zhou Zibin and Liang Rendao from the Jiangxi Federation of Commerce; Wen Duanfu from the Zhejiang Federation of Commerce; Yu Rongqiao and Gao Bochang from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce; Xu Guosen from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce; Zai Yunggu from the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce; Luo Ximing from the Minhou Chamber of Commerce; Chi Yuting from the Shandong Federation of Commerce; Cai Chang from the Guangdong Federation of Commerce; Zhu Yaoting from the Henan Federation of Commerce, and fourteen others. Cao Gexian, the standing committee member of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, and others prepared tea and refreshments to entertain them in the conference hall. Ran Xizhang and Chen Xinyan were immediately recommended to represent Nanjing to participate. At 10:00 AM, the petitioning delegation went to the Central Party Headquarters. Because Secretary-General Ye Chucang was away from Nanjing, they were received by Section Chief Ye Shizhi of the Reception Section on his behalf. The representatives made statements on various points of the petition, the organization of the General Inspection Association, and the preparation of the United Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China. Ye promised to report to the Standing Committee. They then went to the Executive Yuan to petition and were received by Councilor Zhou Xiaobo, who promised to report to the President of the Yuan. They then went to the Legislative Yuan and were received by Secretary Cheng Yuanzhen. The representatives stated the situation of visiting President Sun in Shanghai to petition and requested that the joint liability of the Civil Code Partnership and the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Guild Law be revised. Cheng said that the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Guild Law were currently being studied in the Yuan, and they would be carefully considered. The business community across the country pays great attention to the issue of joint liability, and the Yuan will also pay close attention to it in the future. They then went to the Ministry of Finance and were received by Counselor Zhu Hantao. Luo Qinghua stated that it is the national duty of the business community to assist in suppressing smuggling and made some requests regarding the smuggling inspection method. Regarding the request to postpone the income tax, he said that the disguised likin in various provinces has not been abolished, and businesses are becoming increasingly difficult. He hoped that the Ministry of Finance would urge various provinces to abolish all production and sales taxes, local taxes, and miscellaneous taxes before they are implemented again. It is appropriate to emphasize that the inspection of smuggling is particularly important and introduced Section Chief Wu Jing of the Customs Administration to send someone to discuss in detail. Yu promised to wait for the Minister of Finance to come to Nanjing and report. At noon, Nanjing Chamber of Commerce members Ran Xizhang, Chen Xinyan, Cao Gexian, and others hosted a banquet for the representatives at the Pacific. The representatives returned to Shanghai that night. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Luo Qinghua, Yu Rongqiao, and Yuan Duanfu, assisting the government in rejecting and selling smuggled goods is the national duty of merchants. A meeting was held in Shanghai this time, and members of the General Inspection Association have been recommended and will be established immediately. Inspection sub-associations will also be established in various provinces, cities, and counties, hoping to unite the strength of merchants across the country to take consistent action. However, there are still several points regarding the issuance of certificates by industry associations and various procedures at the customs, and how to make them strict to prevent the sale of smuggled goods, that should be requested from the government. A report has now been made to the Ministry of Finance. As for the government's implementation of income tax, the Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the implementation of direct taxes. However, at present, China's industrial and commercial accounting system has not yet been determined. The taxation of business income is quite difficult to obtain a suitable standard before the accounting system is implemented. Even in Shanghai, there are difficulties, such as the fact that the government has implemented business tax, but Shanghai has not yet done so. The reason is that the implementation of business tax in the concession area has not yet yielded results. If the concession area is not taxed but the Chinese area is taxed, it will only make merchants in the Chinese area feel difficult, and even promote stores to move into the concession area. Therefore, for the implementation of income tax, the Chinese and concession areas must be implemented at the same time. As for the impact of the economic downturn on the business community in recent years, the market is bleak, and business is sluggish. Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes, many provinces have followed suit. However, taxes such as the production and sales tax in Hunan, the bandit suppression surtax in Jiangxi, various special taxes in Guangdong, the local tax in Sichuan, the silkworm improvement fee in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the special consumption tax in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Yunnan are still being levied, which has a huge impact on merchants. Before the implementation of income tax, it is hoped that these taxes can be thoroughly abolished so that merchants can bear fair burdens. As for the provision in Article 681 of the Commercial Law's Borrowing Chapter that partners bear unlimited liability, it is inconsistent with China's national conditions and business practices. The Legislative Yuan has also discussed enacting a Commercial Registration Law to make business accounts easier to collect and improve commercial ethics. All of this is closely related to the interests of merchants, and the government's understanding of the people's feelings will surely be granted. The petitioners have completed their petition and will go to Shanghai that night.</p>

A London newspaper headlined "British Guns in Gibraltar Are Prepared," which demonstrates the UK's serious attention to the incident of Spanish planes dropping bombs in the Strait of Gibraltar, landing near a British mail ship. Moreover, according to reliable sources, the war in Spain is extremely fierce, with many casualties. The American ambassador has requested his government to send a warship to San Sebastián. Rumors say the town is burning after being bombarded by a Spanish warship. Such ominous news causes anxiety about the safety of numerous holiday travelers in Spain. The British Foreign Office has been unable to communicate with Sir Chilton, the British Ambassador to Spain, for several days. It is rumored that the Spanish government has requested French military aircraft for assistance. France, Germany, and Belgium decided to send four bombers to Madrid. There is much debate in France about this. The far-right newspapers criticized the government's involvement in the internal affairs of another country, saying that if the Spanish rebels win, they will surely hate France in the future. Judging from the current situation, the overall situation can be summarized as follows: The Spanish government claims to have consolidated its position around Madrid. However, according to news from Gibraltar, 12,000 members of the Falange party, led by Ansonivo Detrivia, the son of the late dictator Rivera, are now approaching the capital, and a major battle is imminent. Although Barcelona has been under heavy attack, it is still firmly defended by government forces and serves as the headquarters of the government forces, from which planes are sent to bomb the rebel-held town of Zaragoza. The government forces hold Alicante, Murcia, and Malaga in the southeast. Seville in the southwest is apparently still in the hands of the rebels, but a general strike has been implemented there. As for the northern and western regions, most are occupied by the rebels. If the government can win the final victory, it will be due to the assistance of the general public. Many women in various places are now also taking up arms to fight. According to official reports, Madrid is still peaceful. Spanish Prime Minister Azaña issued a broadcast message at midnight, saying that the rebellion has been quelled, and the people must pour out the last drop of blood to preserve the republic.

<p>(Paris) Right-wing newspapers yesterday published news that Spanish air force personnel had been ordered to come here to request the French government to supply weapons to suppress the rebels. The Foreign Ministry has denied this, saying that French weapons cannot be transported abroad unless approved by the ministry, and the Spanish government has never made any such request.

<p>(Paris) According to news from the Port of Gibraltar, the Spanish mainland, and the border between Spain and France, the situation in Spain did not change much last night. The civil war is still continuing. All places where battles have taken place have been reduced to rubble. It is true that government forces have won in many places, but the shortage of food, ammunition, and fuel is also worrying. The same is true on the rebel side. They have divided their forces into two routes, using all their strength to attack the city of Madrid. The southern route is commanded by Deliano, commander of the Andalusia division from the city of Seville, and the northern route is commanded by Mullah. The authorities of various countries are very concerned about the safety of their nationals in Spain. Rebel planes dropped bombs near the Port of Gibraltar yesterday. The port authorities issued a serious warning to General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebels. General Franco immediately gave a satisfactory answer. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Lisbon dispatch received here today, the rebels commanded by Spanish General Mullah are now only fifteen miles from Madrid, waiting for reinforcements to arrive and attack the capital. The Paris Morning Post today published an interview with General Mullah, who said that the revolutionary army might not attack the capital, but instead try to encircle it, causing the city to run out of food and surrender on its own. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Bayonne It is claimed that the Spanish government forces fought fiercely with the rebels all day today. After shelling for fourteen hours, they have retaken San Sebastián, but it is expected that the rebel leader General Mullah still intends to counterattack. (National News, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hendaye, Southern France According to various sources, it is confirmed that the city of San Sebastián in Spain has been recaptured by government troops, but the rebels intend to retake it. The two sides exchanged fire and have not stopped. Even several French naval officers recently took a car to flee from the city to here. The car body is riddled with bullet holes, indicating that the battle is continuing in the places they passed through. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>Commander of the Rebel Army in Pamplona, Spain A bloody battle took place in San Sebastián today. At the same time, rebels from all sides are beginning to encircle Madrid and Barcelona. A special correspondent from the Associated Press witnessed 4,000 imperial troops crossing the water from Navarre to attack San Sebastián near here, and heard the sound of cannons roaring continuously from dawn to late at night. There was fierce fighting everywhere around San Sebastián. Government troops drove the rebels out of the Marie Christine Hotel. The rebels then attacked the city from the mountains. A cruiser in the harbor began shelling the rebel barracks. A rebel plane also dropped bombs and carried out a fierce bombing. Several cars of volunteers passed through the streets, shouting slogans such as "Long live Spain, long live the King, long live the religion." Villagers have joined the army to help the revolution. All police duties are now performed by women. (National News, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France In the east of San Sebastián in northern Spain, a major battle may break out this afternoon. The rebel vanguard, after departing from the city of Pamplona, has now arrived south of Oyarzun, which is only fifteen kilometers away from San Sebastián. A large number of troops followed to attack the city together. The troops of the People's Front in the city have also set up two lines of defense. The first line of defense is used to protect the highway outside the city, and the second line of defense is used to maintain contact between Oyarzun and the city of Irun. The sound of cannons has been faintly heard in the city and its vicinity since yesterday afternoon, and sometimes the sound of gunfire can also be heard clearly. Many embassy personnel from various countries have recently been vacationing in the city. People are deeply concerned about their safety. The offices of the British, French, and German embassies have taken in many French and other foreign nationals, who are using the cellars as lodging places. The French destroyer "Invincible" is about to arrive at the port of the city. The embassy offices will try to escort the evacuees onto the ship this afternoon so that they can leave the dangerous area as soon as possible. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Barcelona A certain member of the Catalan provincial government recently told the press that the situation in Andalusia has become increasingly favorable to the government. Except for the rebels in Seville, who are still stubbornly resisting, the rest of the region is under the control of the government. Rumor has it that General Deliano, the commander of the rebels in the province, is now planning to flee to the Port of Cádiz. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid The situation in Spain has been at a standstill today. There has been no progress on either side, government or rebel. The city of San Sebastián in the north has indeed been recaptured by government forces, but the rebels nearby are still trying to resist stubbornly. The rumor that General Mullah, the commander of the rebel forces in the north, was killed in action yesterday is now known to be false. He was seen in the city of Pamplona this morning. As for the city of Zaragoza (also in the north), which is occupied by the rebels, four columns of government troops, totaling 6,000 men, are now attacking with all their strength, and several planes from Catalonia are flying to assist, dropping many bombs on the city. According to the government, the rebels in the city have been surrounded and will soon fall. However, during the attack, Republican leader Captain Menendez (who was sentenced to death last year for participating in the rebellion, but later had his sentence commuted to 30 years in prison and was eventually pardoned) was captured by the rebels. It is also rumored that the rebels commanded by General Mullah have arrived at a place less than thirty-five kilometers from the capital, but this has not been confirmed. The rebels also claimed to have defeated the government forces in Herling (near Al Albacete). However, according to a report released by the Ministry of the Interior, the rebels in the Guadarrama Mountains (north of the capital) have been defeated by government troops, and the government forces have sent a column to the city of Ávila to pursue them. After recapturing the city of La Granja, another column has advanced towards the city of Segovia. The rebels there have retreated fourteen kilometers. In addition, the warships anchored in the international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa have returned to the Port of Malaga yesterday to refuel. The commander of the fleet has also sent a telegram to the government, pledging his unwavering loyalty. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid General Deliano, the commander of the rebels in Seville, gave a speech to the press last night, saying that General Mullah, the commander of the northern route, led his troops to advance towards the city of Madrid and had defeated the government forces near the Somosierra Pass (about seventy kilometers from the capital), and could soon attack the capital. The leaders of the left-wing People's Front parties have fled to other places. The various news recently released by the radio stations in Madrid and Barcelona are completely inaccurate. The city of Barcelona is now being bombarded by Fascist troops and will soon fall. On the other hand, Gambanis, the chairman of the Catalan autonomous region government, also issued a statement denying the fall of the city of Barcelona. The radio station in the city also broadcast a telegram at 10:30 last night, requesting all workers to end their strikes in order to assist the militia and supply food. This morning, the radio station broadcast another telegram, saying that government troops had recaptured the city of Jaén. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Government War Correspondent Northwest of Madrid Today, the government used infantry, artillery, and air force to suppress the rebels in the Madrid area. An Associated Press reporter witnessed government troops occupying Guadalajara. The reporter departed from Madrid with the army and arrived in Alcalá. He heard that the rebels had occupied many places, but he could not report them due to government censorship. The rebel base in Guadalajara was an orphanage and an airfield. They first used cannons to meet the enemy, but the government troops bravely advanced and finally reached the city. (National News, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid The government issued a warning to the press via wireless broadcast this morning, saying, "Regarding news about the current situation, all newspapers, news agencies, and foreign reporters should strive for accuracy.

There were many casualties in the battle in the Guadarrama Mountains yesterday. The hospitals are overcrowded. The newspapers published news that government troops had recaptured the city of Córdoba (in the southwest). The "Clarida" newspaper reported that "The Lamontanas barracks here were once occupied by the rebels, but were soon recaptured by government troops. All the rebel officers are now detained in a safe place." The Minsheng Bao reported that "The bullfighters were said to have participated in the battle in the Guadarrama Mountains yesterday, and they were very brave."

<p>(London) Because of the critical situation in San Sebastián, Spain, and because British Ambassador Sir Chilton and American Ambassador Bowers are currently on vacation there, the British authorities have dispatched two destroyers to the port. The acting governor of Gibraltar protested to General Franco (the well-known Spanish aviator Major Franco), the leader of the Spanish rebels, because rebel planes had dropped bombs in the Strait of Gibraltar. A satisfactory reply has now been received. Yesterday, Spanish rebel planes suspected that the British mail ship "Gibraltar" was carrying fuel to supply the government warships, and dropped two bombs to attack it. Fortunately, they did not hit. The British destroyer "Whitehall" witnessed this and fired three warning shots at the plane. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the US Navy authorities, the US warship "Oklahoma," currently stationed in Cherbourg, France, has sailed to the area at the request of the US Consul in Bilbao to escort American women and children out of the country, because Bilbao is actually under alert.

Also, according to a telegram from the US Embassy in Madrid, there is only enough food for one week, and because the rebels are now killing the guards of the city's reservoirs, the water supply is also quite worrying. At the same time, the State Department received a telegram forwarded by a French ship, saying that US Ambassador Bowers and his wife are trapped in a private residence outside San Sebastián in northern Spain, and their safety is of great concern. It has also received an official telegram from Johnson, the counselor of the US Embassy, ​​stating that British Ambassador Chilton is also on vacation in San Sebastián and is now trying to send a telegram requesting that a warship be sent there. The counselor's telegram also requested that a US warship be sent immediately, and said that the overall situation there was critical.

<p>(London) The talks between Britain, France, and Belgium concluded at 6:15 PM. It was resolved to immediately invite Italy and Germany to participate in a future five-nation conference. This conference is scheduled to be held in Brussels. The date will be decided after receiving replies from the governments of Italy and Germany, probably around the time of the League of Nations General Assembly (which convenes in September). As for the guarantee that Britain previously offered to France and Belgium (i.e., mutual assistance to safeguard the security of the two countries' borders), this guarantee will remain valid as long as a solution to the European situation is not reached. How the five-nation conference will proceed is another matter. It is reported that Britain has accepted this arrangement. The issue of the Free City of Danzig was not mentioned in the three-nation talks. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Three-Nation Communiqué</p>
<p>(London) After deliberating for twelve hours yesterday, the Locarno Treaty signatory nations—Britain, France, and Belgium—reached a complete agreement late at night. After the meeting, the following communiqué was issued: The representatives of France, Belgium, and Britain, noting the arrangements agreed upon on March 19, the proposals made by the German Chancellor on March 31, and the proposals made by the French government on April 8, have resolved the following articles:</p>
<p>(1) The main goal of European nations must be to consolidate peace through a general resolution.</p>
<p>(2) Such a resolution can only be achieved through the free cooperation of the relevant major powers. Nothing is more detrimental to the hope of such a resolution than if European nations are divided into obvious or actual opposing blocs.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, the three governments believe that a Locarno five-power conference should be convened as soon as it can be conveniently held. In the three countries' opinion, the primary task of this conference should be to negotiate a new treaty to replace the Locarno Rhineland Pact and, through the cooperation of the relevant parties, to resolve the situation caused by Germany's actions on March 7.</p>
<p>(4) Therefore, the three governments propose to consult with the German and Italian governments in the hope that both countries will agree to participate in the proposed conference.</p>
<p>(5) If the conference can make progress, other matters concerning European peace should naturally be brought up for discussion. Under these circumstances, it is hoped that the scope of the discussion will be expanded to facilitate the resolution of these issues through the cooperation of other relevant major powers. The peace of Europe depends on this resolution.</p>
<p>The full text of the communiqué will be jointly sent by Britain, France, and Belgium to the German and Italian governments, and it is hoped that both countries will accept the invitation to the five-power conference and promptly agree on a date for the meeting. British circles highly praise the spirit of cooperation shown by the French and Belgian cabinet members in accommodating the British cabinet members and sincerely participating in new endeavors in order to achieve a lasting European resolution through the free cooperation of all parties. It is said that yesterday's work was based entirely on unity and sincerity. Many view yesterday's compromise as opening up new opportunities for Europe. French opinions believe that the three countries' agreement places primary importance on collective security, and the so-called Four-Power Pact proposal will definitely not be revived. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Invitation Issued</p>
<p>(Berlin) After conducting talks yesterday, the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium immediately agreed to convene a five-nation conference to be joined by Italy and Germany to negotiate a new agreement to replace the Locarno Treaty.

<p>British Aspirations</p>
<p>(London) The highest British foreign affairs authorities have issued an official statement expressing satisfaction with the results of the three-nation talks, especially with France and Belgium's agreement to conduct negotiations with Italy and Germany. It also stated that if a "New Locarno Treaty" cannot be signed, Britain's previous obligations to assist France and Belgium will remain valid. As for the date of the future five-nation conference, it will most likely be around the time of the League of Nations General Assembly in September. The exact date and conference procedures will be decided through diplomatic channels by the countries involved. Britain deeply hopes that the five-nation conference will not limit its efforts to the Western European issue, but will seek a broader solution that includes general European problems. Finally, it stated that the British, French, and Belgian delegations have not only reached an understanding on the procedures for the five-nation conference, but also agree with each other on the fundamental issues to be discussed. The invitation to Germany and Italy to participate in the five-nation conference was issued this evening. Generally, it is believed that after Germany receives the invitation, given the complete harmony of opinions among Britain, France, and Belgium, there will be no further increase in the number of troops stationed in the Rhineland region.

<p>Paris Satisfied</p>

<p>(Paris) Madame Tabouis, a renowned reporter for L'Œuvre, has commented on the talks conducted by the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium in London yesterday, stating that German leader Hitler intends to propose conditions to the Czechoslovak government to define bilateral relations. This information comes from reliable sources and is known to the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium. "It is said that Hitler has proposed two demands: (1) All regions of Czechoslovakia where Germans constitute a majority must be designated as autonomous regions and establish federal relations with other parts of Czechoslovakia. (2) Czechoslovakia and other countries of the Little Entente (i.e., Romania and Yugoslavia) may also join the Four-Power Bloc of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, but Czechoslovakia must abrogate the alliance treaty between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union." These conditions are clearly unacceptable, but once rejected, relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia will inevitably become extremely tense. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita decided that after the Montreal Conference concluded, a conference of ambassadors to Europe would be held in Paris to solicit the opinions of the ambassadors on European countermeasures. He had already telegraphed the ambassadors stationed in various countries to go to Paris to attend the conference. However, recently, the Spanish revolution broke out, and the situation in Western Europe became extremely tense.

The ambassadors stationed in various countries have telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that they cannot leave their posts. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita changed the scheduled date of the conference and postponed it. After the European political situation stabilizes, the conference will be held in late August or early September.

<h3 id="e59">Debate on Unemployment Relief Bill: Unprecedented Drama in British Parliament; Labour MPs Accuse Sir John Simon of Lying; Sing "The Red Flag" in Unison; Result: Three MPs Suspended for Five Days <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(London) Last night, during Home Secretary Sir John Simon's defense of the government's proposed unemployment relief bill in the House of Commons, three Independent Labour Party MPs directly accused Simon of lying. The scene was quite chaotic. As a result, these three MPs were punished with temporary suspension. The incident occurred when Simon was delivering his speech enthusiastically, and the entire chamber erupted. Deputy Speaker Sir Herbert promptly announced a temporary recess. Proceedings resumed after more than eighteen minutes. The parliamentary session lasted a total of thirty-six hours and eighteen minutes. At the end, a new and unusual event occurred. When Conservative MPs moved to adjourn the session, someone suddenly started singing "The Red Flag." Labour MPs in the back rows joined in loudly. The names of the three MPs who were punished with temporary suspension last night are as follows: Mr. Buchanan, MP for Glasgow Gorbals; Mr. Stephen, MP for Glasgow Camlachie; and Mr. McGovern, MP for Glasgow Shettleston. This is the first time in the current parliament that such a suspension has occurred. Because it was the first offense for the three MPs in this parliament, they were only fined a suspension of five days and will still receive their parliamentary salaries. Until their return, Mr. Maxton, MP for Glasgow Bridgeton, will be the sole representative of the Independent Labour Party in the House of Commons. The dispute arose because Mr. Buchanan extended his arm and shouted that Sir John Simon was lying. The Deputy Speaker immediately rose to his feet and addressed Buchanan in a stern voice, asking him not to engage in such behavior that violates the rules of parliament. Buchanan was quite angry and continued to denounce Simon. As the disruption increased, Buchanan persisted and refused to listen to advice. The Deputy Speaker then issued a warning, stating that if he did not comply, it was his duty to impose a punishment. Buchanan became enraged and did not stop his abuse. The Deputy Speaker then announced that he would be punished for non-compliance. Sir John Simon immediately proposed a customary motion to suspend his attendance. There was a great uproar in the chamber. Mr. Stephen protested the suspension of his party colleague and criticized Conservative MPs for abusing their power. As the disorder increased, the Deputy Speaker announced a temporary recess. The proceedings had already lasted more than twenty-seven hours. Subsequently, the motions to suspend Buchanan and Stephen were passed by 248 votes to 53 and 256 votes to 51, respectively. However, even after the two MPs left, the dispute continued. When Sir John Simon rose to continue his speech, there was much jeering from the Labour MPs. At this point, Labour MP Mr. Cocks exclaimed, "We all know that Sir John Simon is a liar!" The chair at the time, Speaker Fitzroy, immediately spoke, saying that it would greatly contribute to the maintenance of parliamentary dignity if Cocks could refrain from making such statements. Unexpectedly, Independent Labour Party MP Mr. McGovern suddenly accused Sir John Simon of being a "despicable liar." Because he refused to heed the warning, Simon then proposed a motion to suspend his attendance. A vote was taken and passed by 262 votes to 11. Most of the Labour Party members holding official positions did not participate in the vote. When the Speaker asked McGovern to leave the chamber, McGovern refused. The Sergeant-at-Arms then responded to the Speaker's request and urged him to leave the chamber. Finally, the leader of his party, Mr. Maxton, gently touched his back, and then the Sergeant-at-Arms escorted him out of the chamber, ending the drama. Compared to previous sessions, it seemed quite tame. The cabinet members in attendance laughed heartily. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Attempt to Assassinate British King: Accused Re-Examined; Preparation for Public Prosecution Under the Treason Act; Defendant's Letter to Simon Read Aloud in Court <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(London) George Andrew McMahon, who was arrested on the 16th of this month for attempting to assassinate the British King, reappeared in the dock of the Bow Street Magistrates' Court today to be questioned by Sir Campbell. According to Attorney General Sir Somervell, who is prosecuting the case, in addition to the charges of illegally carrying a handgun and intending to endanger life, the defendant will also be publicly prosecuted under the Treason Act of 1842. Sir Somervell further explained that this new charge refers to the provisions of Section 11 of the Act and is not high treason but other statutory minor offenses. The first offense he committed was carrying a gun near the King and attempting to disrupt public order. The second offense was carrying a handgun with the intent to frighten the King. Sir Somervell continued, stating that the day before the incident, McMahon went to a public restaurant near Buckingham Palace, where he dined daily, and told the waitress that they would probably never see each other again, adding that something unexpected would happen and she could learn all about it in the newspapers. On the day of the incident, while the defendant was standing in the crowd watching the procession, he spoke to a mounted police officer and asked him to remove the hideous horse's head. It was also discovered that the defendant had written a short note, apparently to his wife, containing only one sentence, "Please allow me Ireland." As for the handgun that Special Constable Dyke knocked from the defendant's hand, it was loaded with bullets, with only one chamber empty. A pull of the trigger would fire the bullet. After the defendant was arrested, he initially said at the police station, "What I did was right and just. It would not have been difficult for me to shoot the King, but I missed the opportunity." After being questioned by Sir Rollo last week, he added, "I wanted to shoot myself in front of the King, but I failed to do so." (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The defense lawyer for McMahon, the assailant in the assassination attempt on the British King, Mr. Carlsting, read aloud in court today a letter from the defendant to Home Secretary Sir John Simon, in which he described himself as an innocent victim under "organized persecution by your department" because it prevented him from obtaining employment. The letter also stated that he had previously petitioned the King but had not been granted an audience. Now, he demanded complete satisfaction within fourteen hours, or he would exercise his own privilege to obtain appropriate satisfaction. The letter concluded by saying, "This is not an idle threat. I demand fairness, regardless of the outcome." (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>— Our Reporter Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>So he gave us several small books and printed materials, one of which was the Showa 10th edition of the "Kobe City Overview." In addition, there were beautifully printed materials compiled by the tourism section, such as "Kobe for Tourism," "Kobe Guide," "Historical Sites of the Genpei War," "Visiting Kobe Temples and Shrines," "Kobe City Picture Postcards," and so on. He pointed to the "Kobe City Overview" and said to us, "The Showa 11th edition is not yet printed. You can also find some materials regarding the city's finances in the roads section."</p>
<p>(Note) According to the Kobe City Overview, the Kobe City budget for the fiscal year of Showa 8 showed that under the revenue item, the city expenses belonging to the ordinary economy were more than 17.68 million yuan (Japanese yen), and those belonging to the special economy were more than 25.47 million Japanese yen. Under the expenditure item, regular expenses were more than 27.7 million yuan, and temporary expenses were more than 15.3 million yuan. The direct national tax and city tax borne by Kobe citizens in the fiscal year of Showa 8 increased compared to the fiscal year of 7. The average burden per person was 9 yuan and 50 sen for direct national tax, and 10 yuan and 65 sen for city tax, totaling 20 yuan and 15 sen.</p>
<p>We didn't want to ask anything else, so we thanked Secretary Kai and walked out of the city hall.</p>
<p>(5) Sakaemachi and Motomachi</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we wanted to visit the local newspaper offices, so we went to Sakaemachi. This is the financial center of Kobe, with stone and steel-reinforced concrete buildings standing one after another, mostly banks or companies. The two local tabloid newspapers in Kobe, Yushin Nippo and Kobe Shinkai, are also located there.</p>
<p>We went to Yushin Nippo first. We were received by Omi Kaname, a reporter from the social affairs department of the editorial bureau. Later, we went to Kobe Shimbun, where we were also received by a reporter from the social affairs department of the editorial bureau. The scale of both newspaper offices is not large. The former has a capital of 400,000 yuan (Japanese yen), and the president is named Takagi Kurakichi. The latter has a capital of 500,000 yuan, and the president is named Shindo Nobuyoshi. The internal organization is roughly the same. The entire company is divided into three bureaus: editorial, printing, and business. The editorial bureau is further divided into four departments: politics, economics, society, and art. All political news must be sent to the prefectural government for review every day. All the machinery in the printing bureau, including the printing cylinder, is domestically manufactured. The typesetters all wear black work clothes, and lighter tasks such as returning lead letters are the responsibility of female workers.</p>
<p>In the evening, Consul-General Jiang invited us to dinner at the Ginsui Western-style restaurant in Sakaemachi. The restaurant is located in the basement of a bank building. Going down the marble staircase, there is a large restaurant, decorated luxuriously, with valuable oil paintings hanging on the walls, and a fountain in the center. We first entered another lounge to chat with Consul-General Jiang and Vice-Consul Pan for a while, and then went to the restaurant for dinner. The host's hospitality, the elegance of the place, the abundance of dishes, and the attentive service of the beautiful waitresses made us feel infinite gratitude and pleasure.</p>
<p>After leaving the restaurant, we thanked Consuls Jiang and Pan and walked to Motomachi for sightseeing. This is one of the bustling centers of Kobe. The asphalt streets are not particularly wide, and there are no tram tracks running through them. Neat rows of lily-of-the-valley-style electric lights form countless brilliant arcs. It is said that the design of these streetlights was created by a professor of engineering in Japan. Various small Japanese-style shops are opened on both sides of the street, and there are also magnificent department stores and glamorous dance halls and cafes. On one section of the road, rows of stalls do business under their own gas lamps, adding to the liveliness of the city. We walked among crowds of people in various costumes, occasionally hearing the tunes of Japanese songs broadcast on the radio from both sides, and seeing young men on dates walking out of dance halls with dancers' arms in theirs, we couldn't help but feel a beautiful and exotic flavor in our hearts.</p>
<p>It was already past 10 o'clock when we returned to the hotel. Vice-Consul Pan knew that we would be going to Osaka tomorrow morning, so he came to the hotel late at night with Chen Deqi, the secretary of the consulate, to have a long talk with us. Thanks to their guidance, we gained a lot of convenience in our subsequent travels. We will never forget their kindness and teachings.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Hebei-Chahar Political Council Adds Four Members; Cao Rulin Will Be Relied Upon for Diplomatic Issues; Mongolian Representatives Arrive in Beiping to Discuss the Current Situation in Inner Mongolia <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: From a superficial perspective, the situation in North China has been generally calm for the past month. Since the swift resolution of the so-called incident at Kakudai Dagu, the Hebei-Chahar authorities have been actively strengthening their internal affairs. Regarding personnel matters, concrete discussions were held when Wang Kemin came to Beiping. Wang also telegraphed Cao Rulin in Tianjin to come to Beiping for consultations. Cao stayed in Beiping for one night and then returned to Tianjin. As a result of the consultations, Song Zheyuan telegraphed Beijing to recommend Cao Rulin, Tang Erhe, Liu Ruming, and Ge Dingyuan as members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The Executive Yuan approved this on the 21st. Cao was originally a diplomatic advisor to the council. All parties believe that the government will rely heavily on Cao in future diplomatic issues. Tang Erhe was invited to Tianjin when Wang Kemin arrived to seek his opinions. Tang is a senior alumnus of Japanese studies and was heavily relied upon when Huang Fu presided over the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. His re-appointment this time is also based on trust. Liu Ruming, now the chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, is naturally a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Ge Dingyuan was originally the secretary-general of the Political Council and has been trusted by Song and others since taking office. Although he is now a member of the council, Ge will continue to serve as secretary-general. It is reported that before the announcement of the four members, the list was finalized by Wang Kemin in Beiping and brought to Beijing by Wang for discussion and publication. After Yang Zhaogeng, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Chahar Provincial Government, was transferred to the position of director of the Department of Political Affairs of the Political Council, he could not concurrently serve as the director of the Department. On the 21st, the council issued an order for Chairman Liu Ruming to concurrently serve as the director. Guo Zhihan, the director of the Department of Finance of Chahar Province, is now the director of the Department of Finance of the Political Council and finds it difficult to be responsible for the affairs of the Department of Finance of Chahar Province. At the same time, the council ordered Yang Mu, who was the director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau during the Northwest Army era, to act as the director. Zhang Yunrong succeeded as the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy, and Li Zishi succeeded as the Tianjin Customs Superintendent. Regarding diplomatic issues concerning "Eastern Hebei" and "Northern Chahar," although Itagaki and Tada had repeated consultations when they were in Beiping and Tianjin, they ultimately did not reach any results. Since Tashiro and Matsumuro took office, they have also contacted them several times, but the other party has refused to discuss the issues further, claiming that they want to change the political issues of Hebei and Chahar. As a result, the negotiations have stalled. Recently, Matsumuro has even said that there are no diplomatic issues to discuss in Hebei and Chahar, making it impossible to proceed. They can only let things take their natural course.</p>
<p>Regarding Inner Mongolia, the situation is not very clear. Representatives of Prince De have recently arrived in Beiping. According to the representatives, Prince De's environment in Mongolia is too harsh. Although there are many unclear rumors outside, he has never betrayed the central government and still hopes for a comprehensive solution to protect the border.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Han River Continues to Rise; The Issue of Blocking the Breach of the Yaodi Embankment in Zhongxiang; Funding Needs Range from 800,000 to 2 Million Yuan; Qin Fen Flies from Beijing to Wuhan to Inspect Shagang <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the continuous breaches of the Yaodi Embankment in Zhongxiang, the waters of the Xiang River have been rising excessively, threatening the lives of citizens in eleven counties and cities, including Zhongxiang, Jingmen, Tianmen, and Hanchuan. When the embankment was repaired by the Xiang Embankment Engineering Office, it already cost 2.7 million yuan. During the period when the Disaster Relief Committee was blocking the breach, it cost another 300,000 yuan, totaling more than 3 million yuan. Now, if they want to rebuild it, not only is the project huge and time is tight, but also the funding is difficult to raise. If they postpone construction, they will sit idly by while the citizens of eleven counties are submerged. The government is in a situation where it wants to act but cannot, and wants to stop but cannot. The responsible personnel are also trapped in a dilemma.范熙績, the director of the Disaster Relief Committee, previously convened a meeting. After careful study by various engineering experts, they summarized four proposals: (1) Shi Dupei, the chief engineer of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, proposed to block the original breach with 8,000 cubic meters of boulders to close the gap, with the addition of riprap dams and diversion channels, requiring a total of 1.45 million yuan; (2) Chen Ruzhen, a commissioner of the Economic Commission, proposed to use the gabion method to build double dams inside and outside the original breach to close the gap, using thorny branches as the main material, along with ancillary works, requiring more than 1.9 million yuan; (3) Yang Silian and Wang Zhang, commissioners of the provincial government, proposed to build a crescent embankment outside the original breach, using the old method of driving piles, making mud sweeps, and throwing boulders to close the gap, requiring 880,000 yuan including ancillary works; (4) Another proposal was to abandon blocking the breach during the flood season and wait until autumn to first block the original dam at Xiongjia Bridge, so that the Yaodi breach would dry up, and then block the breach, also requiring more than 800,000 yuan including ancillary works. Among the above four items, the first item was absolutely impossible to adopt because the time to purchase and transport the boulders was too long. The second item required too much funding, and the time was not economical. The third item was the fastest and the cost was lower than the first two, but the risk was greater. The fourth item required the least funding and was the most stable, but it could not be carried out at this time. As a result, the discussions were divided, and no agreement was reached. The project was increasingly stalled. Qin Fen, the secretary-general of the committee, specially took a plane from Beijing to Wuhan with water conservancy expert Pu Deli on the 21st. He exchanged views with Lu Zhu, the secretary-general of the provincial government, and Liu Shupeng, the director of the Department of Construction. He then took a special boat to Shagang Embankment to inspect the breach and discussed everything in detail with Fan Xiji before returning to Wuhan to meet with Yang Yongtai, the chairman of the provincial government. What method will be adopted will have to wait for the final decision of Yang and Qin. (July 21)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Financial Stability Gradually Achieved in Sichuan Province; Local Currency Disappears, Exchange Rates Decrease; Promotion of the New Currency Balances Prices <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Since the Central Bank established branches in Chengdu and Chongqing and offices in Wanxian and Santai to make every effort to adjust, the financial situation in Sichuan Province has gradually stabilized. Local newspapers do not have detailed records. The general outline is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Suppressing Exchange Rates: Before the Central Bank established branches in Chengdu and Chongqing, the exchange rates for foreign currency in the two places were alarmingly high. The highest rate was 440 yuan of exchange rate for every 1,000 yuan exchanged for Shanghai currency. The exchange rates fluctuated constantly, and unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to manipulate them. Legitimate merchants suffered great losses when purchasing and transporting goods. After the Central Bank implemented the method of equal exchange rates, the exchange between Sichuan and Shanghai became very convenient and inexpensive. As a result, the exchange of foreign currency in Sichuan Province became extremely convenient, and the commercial transportation between Sichuan and Shanghai gradually recovered to its past prosperity.</p>
<p>Recalling and Destroying Local Currency: The former Sichuan Local Bank issued 30 million yuan in banknotes. Because they were issued in Chongqing, the markets in Chengdu referred to them as Chongqing currency or local currency. Their prices also fluctuated like the exchange rates in the past, sometimes rising to more than 90% and sometimes falling to more than 60%. The lives of ordinary people were unstable. After the Chairman's Headquarters resolutely decided to issue an order to recall and destroy local currency at 80% of the legal currency or 100% of the local currency, the Sichuan Provincial Government borrowed 24 million yuan of legal currency with financial bonds to entrust the two branches of the Central Bank to successively recall 30 million yuan of local currency. It was recalled and destroyed in succession. By the end of last year, local currency had disappeared from the markets in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>Promoting Legal Currency: When the national government promulgated the new currency policy, prices in Shanghai and Hankou rose slightly, but the markets in Sichuan Province were not affected. The reason was that the Central Bank clearly stipulated methods to eliminate exchange rates and uniformly exchange currency. The Chengdu and Chongqing branches collected and delivered legal currency in general. Merchants in the two cities, who had suffered from high exchange rates, were relieved of a heavy burden and were happy to use legal currency for foreign exchange. Those who did not have legal currency purchased it with cash. At that time, it required 120 yuan in cash in the Chengdu market to purchase 100 yuan of legal currency. Therefore, legal currency could be circulated in Sichuan. Later, because the Central Bank followed orders and allowed various banks to use 60% of cash and 40% of public bonds to receive 100% of legal currency, various banks competed to purchase cash. As a result, the price of legal currency slightly decreased, and the banks benefited greatly from this banknote subsidy. As a result, finance became more stable.</p>
<p>Issuing Subsidiary Currency: Sichuan Province had the most subsidiary currency coins, the worst quality, and the most types in the country. Later, because unscrupulous merchants manipulated and ignorant villagers hoarded copper coins, bad coins became scarce commodities. In April and May of this year, one yuan of legal currency could only be exchanged for 18,000 copper coins, and it was not easy to obtain. All the money shops removed their currency exchange signs. Exchanging currency required personal connections. For a time, the city and suburbs felt quite panic. By June, the copper-nickel subsidiary coins minted by the Central Mint were transported to Sichuan Province, first issued in Chongqing, and then successively transported to Chengdu. The total amount was more than 1 million yuan, gradually spreading throughout society. As a result, the difficulty of exchanging legal currency was completely eliminated. From then on, currency prices never rose or fell, and commodity prices were balanced. However, the old and inferior copper coins cast in Sichuan Province are still circulating in the market, and the people are suffering. It is hoped that the government will issue a clear order to abolish all the old and inferior copper coins and order the government to recall and recast them within a limited time. At the same time, the Central Bank should continue to transport copper-nickel subsidiary currency to Sichuan to regulate the market. If so, the chaotic currency system problem in Sichuan Province for many years can be thoroughly resolved, and the people's livelihood can be stabilized.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The educational circles in Hubei Province often experienced turmoil in the past few years, but have calmed down in recent years. The teaching results have indeed made significant progress. However, this year's summer vacation, all public and private middle school faculty and staff in the province held lectures. The Department of Education ordered the addition of a concentrated training program, from August 3 to 28, as a period of military management. Those who did not receive training would have their qualifications as faculty and staff revoked, which led to disputes. The Department of Education stated in a letter that it was determined to maintain its authority. The teachers, on the other hand, refused to accept in order to preserve their dignity. Although they have not yet gone to extremes, it is difficult to resolve the issue immediately. Cheng Qibao, the director of the Department of Education, specially issued a letter to the faculty and staff, and the faculty and staff also published a notice in the newspaper. More than 40 faculty and staff representatives held a discussion meeting at the YMCA in Wuhan City today (23rd) to discuss how to deal with the situation and to entertain reporters and report on the progress of the situation. It can be seen that this matter has not yet found a solution. The main points of Cheng Qibao's letter to the faculty and staff and the report of the faculty and staff are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cheng Qibao's Letter to Faculty and Staff</p>
<p>In summary, the methods set for this session of the lecture are aimed at refining the spirit of colleagues, improving the atmosphere of the education community. At the beginning of the establishment, it was inevitable that the rope would be tightened too strictly. All those who can find ways to improve have been revised again and again. The time period has been extended, and the technical subjects are only 50 minutes each day, and the training is divided into groups in consideration of physical strength and age. Other matters such as food, accommodation, rescue, and hygiene are also well planned within the scope of possibility. If it is still said that the physical strength is still not up to par, it is difficult to believe. Recalling the summer of the 23rd year, the summer lecture for elementary schools also adopted a group living method. At that time, the weather was hot and the equipment was lacking, far exceeding this lecture. However, the elementary school faculty and staff who participated were energetic and initially did not hear anyone reporting that they were in pain. Middle school teachers occupy a very important position in society. At this time, when the country is in trouble, saving the country is an important task and cannot be shirked. They should follow President Chiang Kai-shek's instructions to work hard and move forward, exercise their bodies, and encourage the people. From any point of view, there should be no doubt. Moreover, the lecture is an important policy decided by the government, and the method has been announced long ago and is bound to be implemented. If you cannot understand this intention and cause obstacles, how will you serve as an example to society and supervise students in the future? And the government will never turn a blind eye to this. I hope you will understand this intention well and participate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Representatives State Their Position</p>
<p>Faculty and staff representatives reported the progress of the matter to reporters today and stated their position. Zhang Huiwu, Xia Bochu, and Wang Shunqing spoke in succession, expressing their absolute support for the principle of centralized training. The Department of Education has clearly stipulated summer academic lectures, and faculty and staff have actively participated in previous summer lectures. The government can carry out centralized training of faculty and staff at any time in the future. Why must it be during the short summer vacation, and there should be no regulation that those who do not receive training will not be certified? This move would wipe out the qualifications that faculty and staff have obtained over many years from elementary school to university. Moreover, the teachers' petitions have not been approved by the authorities, and it is not known how much the content has been improved. It is hoped that the authorities will respect the personality of the education community. In addition, it is also necessary to study the reform of middle schools in fact. The number of hours undertaken by class instructors is equal to that of full-time teachers. With more than a dozen classes of students in middle schools, it is difficult for one instructor to guide and manage internal affairs with their energy. (July 23)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The opening of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which the whole country has been looking forward to, was originally scheduled to be realized, but it has been delayed until now due to the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. Now that Chen Jitang has been forced to go to Hong Kong, the situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The call for the opening of the entire line has been revived. Although the two steel bridges at Jiufeng and Tiantoushui in the southern section were destroyed by the military, it is not enough to hinder progress. The Ministry of Railways believes that the construction of the Zhushao section has been completed and is actively planning for direct through traffic on the entire line. All the management bureaus of the Xiang-E and Guang-Shao sections and the engineering bureau of the Zhushao section should be merged and organized under one authority. An order has been issued by the ministry on the 21st to reorganize into the "Guangdong-Hankou Railway Administration," and Ling Hongxun and Zhou Zhongqi have been appointed as the director and deputy director of the bureau. The organizational regulations have also been issued with the order. The three bureaus will be merged and reorganized, and the bureau headquarters will be located in Xujiapeng, Wuchang. It is scheduled to be formally established on August 1. The organizational system takes the Railway Administration as the highest management authority of the entire line. Under the director and deputy director, there are six departments: Secretariat, General Affairs, Transportation, Business, Engineering, Factory Affairs, and Accounting. The candidates for the Secretary and the heads of each department have also been internally determined. The General Affairs Department has jurisdiction over six sections: (1) Documents Section, (2) Personnel Section, (3) Materials Section, Materials Factory, (4) Industry Section, (5) Health Section, (6) Affairs Section. The Transportation Department has jurisdiction over five sections: (1) Operations Section, (2) Telecommunications Section, (3) Mechanical Engineering Section, (4) Accounting Section, (5) Transportation Section, Transportation Station. The Business Department has jurisdiction over three sections: (1) Passenger Section, (2) Freight Section, (3) Business Section.

The Factory Affairs Department has jurisdiction over three sections: (1) Management Section, (2) Technical Section, (3) Machine Factory and the Guangdong Office, the Hankou Office. The Accounting Department has jurisdiction over three sections: (1) General Audit Section, (2) Inspection Section, (3) Cashier Section. Ling, who was concurrently the director of the Xiang-E sections of the Zhushao headquarters, had previously requested to return to Hankou from Beijing. It is reported that he has gone to Hengzhou again to make arrangements. The opening of the entire line will not be far off. (July 21)</p>

<p>Recently, theft cases have occurred frequently in urban and rural areas. Although the military and police authorities have worked hard to prevent and arrest criminals, there have been few solved cases. Hua Ming, a female nun who is the abbot of the Xiuxi Zen Temple, also known as the Smallpox Temple, located on the south side of the Nianfeng Rushou Bridge, No. 28 Yang Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in the western suburbs of the city, recently collected 200 yuan to repair the temple, which was dilapidated. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 a.m. yesterday, three or four robbers speaking the local dialect broke into the temple with guns and robbed all 200 yuan. Before leaving, they fired three shots as a warning. After Luo, the patrol officer of the Third Precinct, investigated the case, he reported it to his superiors and requested an arrest. In addition, Feng Bozhong, a resident of Shenxiang Town in the Fourth District, and Xia Yougen and Xia Shengtang, residents of Xiahengjing Township in the Seventh District, were also robbed successively and reported to the county. County Magistrate Li Leng believes that robbery cases are frequently heard in urban and rural areas, and it is necessary to strengthen the work in local defense and arrest. Therefore, he convened the 12th Security Brigade Headquarters, the Provincial Water Police Team, the Public Security Bureau, and the Water Patrol Team at the county government at 3:00 p.m. today (24th) to discuss local security. Detailed measures have been taken on both defense and arrest, which will be implemented immediately.</p>

<p>The soybean cake industry in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, and other places previously applied to the ministry and provincial authorities for a tax reduction because the business tax rate levied on the industry was originally 0.2%, but later increased to 0.5%. At a time when commerce is declining, the burden is really unbearable, so they have repeatedly striven to reduce the tax to 0.2% in order to maintain commerce, etc. The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce also submitted an application to the ministry for a tax reduction for this issue. The Ministry of Industry has now issued an order saying, "After investigation, this case was previously submitted to the ministry by the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce based on the association's letters and telegrams. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has been consulted regarding the case of Jiangsu Province levying an additional business tax on the soybean cake industry. The Jiangnan Soybean Cake Industry Association has requested the Jiangsu Provincial Government for a response. According to the regulations, the soybean cake industry should not be levied at 0.5%. It is now handled in accordance with the regulations and there is no additional increase. Please know that your request should not be discussed," etc. The County Chamber of Commerce often immediately forwarded the order to the industry association to inform them.</p>

<p>After the wealthy businessman Zhang Yuejie of Yingchunfang passed away, he left behind millions of dollars in inheritance and was one of the largest landowners in Suzhou. Zhang Yuanru, the concubine of Zhang Hebo, a descendant of Zhang Yuejie, and his wife, Zhang Yaoshuhui, were involved in a dispute over the inheritance. The three-trial process concluded with Zhang Yuanru winning the case. Therefore, she further attached the old house in Yingchunfang, which had been valued at 120,000 yuan by the local court, and scheduled to be auctioned on the 25th (the house has a garden and more than a hundred rooms). However, Zhang Yaoshuhui suddenly accused Zhang Yuanru and Li Dingsheng of adultery in the Shanghai Special District Court last month, but was rejected by the Special District Court. Therefore, Li Dingsheng believes that Zhang Yaoshuhui deliberately slandered him and also accused Zhang Yaoshuhui of slander in the Shanghai Special District Court. Because Zhang Yaoshuhui could not be summoned, an arrest warrant has been approved.</p>

<h3 id="e76">New President of the Guangdong High Court, Ye Xiasheng, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Discusses Four Major Plans to Rectify the Judiciary in Guangdong Province; Will Take a Steamer on the 25th to Guangdong to Assume Office <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Ye Xiasheng, the newly appointed president of the Guangdong High Court, was summoned to Beijing by President Ju of the Judicial Yuan and President Sun of the Legislative Yuan during the personnel changes in Guangdong and Guangxi to provide advice. Now, he has been entrusted with a new mission to be responsible for rectifying the judiciary in Guangdong Province. After visiting and seeking instructions from the two Presidents Ju and Sun of the Executive and Legislative Yuan and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Judicial Administration in Beijing, he left Beijing on the 11:00 PM express train the night before last and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Visiting the Mayor</p>
<p>He went to the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road to rest. Then, at around 9:00 AM, he drove to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu. The mayor hosted a luncheon at the Municipal Government to fulfill the hospitality of the host. Ye also visited various new constructions in the central urban area until around 3:00 PM before returning to the hotel.</p>
<p>Returning South This Morning</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM that evening, prominent figures from Guangdong residing in Shanghai and lawyers Feng Bingnan, Wu Chengyu, Zai Siji, Cao Daozhi, etc., jointly hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel. Ye is scheduled to take the French mail ship General Joffre this morning to return south. The ship arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. It is scheduled to depart south at 11:00 AM sharp.</p>
<p>Ye's Remarks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Ye at the station and asked about the issue of reorganizing the judiciary in Guangdong Province. According to him, during the Guangdong Restoration of 1911, he served as the Minister of Justice in Guangdong. At that time, he was young and had little time. He went to Beijing to work for the Provisional Government, so he had no suggestions. When Premier Sun Yat-sen went south to uphold the constitution in 1917, the Minister of Interior, concurrently managing judicial administration, was the current President Ju of the Judicial Yuan. He was then Deputy Minister. At that time, the Gui clique occupied Guangdong, and everything was obstructed, the judiciary was dark, and the people suffered. Premier Sun Yat-sen ordered him to lead eight soldiers to take over the four judicial bureaus. Mo Rongxin was furious and surrounded the court with two battalions of soldiers all day long, but could do nothing about Premier Sun Yat-sen. He followed the instructions of Minister Ju and made major rectifications. The people were delighted and called Premier Sun Yat-sen the "Blue Sky," and the affection still remains today. The good laws and intentions have been followed without interruption. Unfortunately, it only lasted four months, and the Marshal's Office was forced to disperse by the warlords. Although Premier Sun Yat-sen later re-established his government in Guangdong, the constant warfare made it impossible to take care of it. Over the past ten years, the accumulated malpractices have deepened. This time, with the Guangdong situation stabilized, the Central Government complied with public opinion, and the two presidents of the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration considered him to be a guide and assigned him this task. He believed that since the Northern Expedition, he had been living off his savings and had no intention of asking about politics. However, seeing the Guangdong people suffer under the tyrannical government year after year, all attributed to the poor judiciary, he, out of a sense of urgent concern for his homeland and compassion for the people, became Feng Fu again. The mandates he received from the Central Government are: (1) to close the Southwest Branch Court, (2) to rectify the discipline of the legal profession, (3) to eliminate poverty, corruption, and long-standing malpractices, and (4) to seek convenience for the public. Although he is not talented, he firmly believes that his two colleagues, Xie Yingbo and Du Zhiqiu, who have also been entrusted by the Central Government, will be able to understand the virtues of the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, implement the people-saving proposals, and serve as loyal servants for their hometown.</p>

<p>The banking industry in Shanghai has been actively investing in rural areas in the interior in recent years and has achieved considerable success. According to sources in the industry yesterday, leaders of the banking industry in Shanghai, recognizing that the banking industry itself has been affected by the social depression, resulting in a decline in business, and that the economic decline in rural areas in the interior is the only cause of the social depression, for the purpose of adjusting inland finance and developing banking business, banks such as the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial Bank began to invest in rural areas two or three years ago. Although the investment is limited, it has achieved remarkable results. Investing in the interior has low profits and many affairs, but there is no risk of loss. Therefore, larger banks in Shanghai will also increase their investment in the interior to spread it to various places. At the same time, the establishment of farmers' banks and farmers' loans in various places will also provide significant assistance in adjusting rural finance.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Zhejiang Provincial Association Held a Board Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Association convened a meeting of the standing directors at its meeting place in Lianzhuli, Avenue Evigny, at 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Chu Huiseng. The formalities were carried out as usual. First, the chairman reported the purpose of today's meeting: one was for Mr. He Zhongliu to state the matters of the bandit police in eastern Zhejiang, and the other was for the Dai Mountain massacre. Discussing Zhejiang affairs in Zhejiang, the association should make some expression. The results of the discussion: (1) Regarding the Dai Mountain massacre, according to those who came to Shanghai from Dai Mountain to state the details, the case was actually initiated by the mountain tax police. The salt farmers' request to postpone the returning of the salt mounds was not inappropriate. A quarrel with a surveyor started the conflict. The tax police immediately dispatched a large armed police force to fire warning shots, killing several salt farmers. As a result, the fishermen took the opportunity to form a team to resist and vent their anger, resulting in the tragic case of killing officials, destroying bureaus, and strangling many people. It was decided to handle this case separately. Regarding the salt farmers, the government's salt transport envoy and commissioner's office should be notified by telegram to investigate the victimized salt farmers and provide appropriate compensation. The fleeing salt farmers should be persuaded to return to their hometowns and resume their businesses, and the manufacturers should be supervised to prepare funds for reopening the salt fields at the same time. As for the returning of the salt mounds and the purchase of land, the price must be paid according to the value, and no arbitrary occupation is allowed. The tax police captain who caused the trouble should be severely punished. Regarding the fishermen, their usual hardships should be stated, such as the discoloration of the salt, rain, and water stains. If the color is slightly lighter, it must be punished and confiscated. The confiscated salt can be freely sold by the tax police after paying taxes. In the past, a single was issued once a year. Before the single was exhausted, the stored salt was also considered private salt and confiscated. Fishing must take advantage of the tide. In the past, it was customary to issue a single at night, but now it is stipulated that the office must check the points. If the time is missed, the single cannot be issued to go to sea, and the fishermen's losses are even greater. As for the fish, after it has discolored, whether red or black, it is not easy to be welcomed by customers. If used as substitute for bran, the tax police believe that it can be mixed with edible salt after being screened. If rice bran is used, the fish will be easily moldy and rotten due to heavy steaming. In the past, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry requested the salt affairs officials in Shandong to find ways to improve the situation, and the result was a temporary suspension. The above matters should be submitted to the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for review and handling. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. Attached is the text of the telegram sent by the association to President Chiang Kai-shek: (Omitted title) Recently, a fellow townsman from Jinhua stated that bandits have risen in eastern Zhejiang, Kaihua was once lost, and recently they have also disturbed the Yongkang and Yiwu areas. The villagers of Jinhua have moved to the city in droves. We are sending a telegram to implore Your Excellency to quickly dispatch strong troops to suppress the bandits and appease the people.

The dam site is located upstream of the Old Dragon King Temple, at the old canal entrance of Guanghui, made of cement, with a top height of 68 meters, a top width of 5 meters, and a maximum depth of 9.2 meters. The stonework volume is 4,413.6 cubic feet. In 1930, there was a severe drought in North China, and the land was barren for thousands of miles. The China International Famine Relief Commission proposed organizing work relief and opening up the Jinghui Canal to save the people and benefit irrigation. The Shaanxi Provincial Government strongly supported its success and cooperated with it. The Honolulu Chinese General Chamber of Commerce then rose up to assist in raising donations to help achieve this goal. It successively contributed 145,000 yuan in national currency. The Famine Relief Commission specially allocated this amount to build the water barrier dam. In order to leave a permanent memorial, it was named Honolulu. Construction began in the summer of 1931 and was completed in June of the following year. It faces the Zhu Zibeike Two Bridges from a distance and is sufficient for thousands of years. The Honolulu Chinese Overseas Community in Honolulu published the second collection of "Honolulu Overseas Chinese" this year, naming it after the dam, which is a credit to the overseas Chinese in Honolulu. It is planned to interview the detailed construction process and publish it in order to leave a record. The president of the community, Zhuo Lin, returned to Shanghai on the President Coolidge ocean liner the day before yesterday and specially inquired about the details from the Chinese Foreign Relief Commission. An Xianjin, the executive committee member of the commission, and others warmly entertained him, hosted a banquet, and presented him with photos of the dam and explanations in Chinese and English. It is heard that Zhuo Jun was very happy to obtain this good material.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Jianghai Customs Wharf Tax Reduction Insufficient to Pay Off Municipal Bonds Principal and Interest; Has Been Covered by Advances from Customs Duties <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing: In the first quarter of 1936, the amount of the Jianghai Customs Wharf Tax that the Shanghai Municipal Government should have received was insufficient to pay off the principal and interest of the Municipal Reconstruction Public Bonds for that quarter. The Inspector General of Customs has approved the coverage of the shortfall with customs duties. A special request has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance to transfer funds to the Shanghai Municipal Government to repay the advances.</p>

<p>Various groups such as the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Chaozhou Fellow Association, and the Jiaying Five Counties Fellow Association, concerned about their homeland, recently sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting a thorough renewal of the Guangdong government and telegraphed the leaders of the fellow associations and various groups, unanimously advocating the removal of the latter. It is now learned that President Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan replied yesterday: The Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, and all the fellow associations should be informed. Your telegram has been received. Your association's concern for its homeland is the same as the Central Government's purpose of renewing the Guangdong situation. The matters mentioned in the telegram will be noted. This is a special reply. Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Real Estate Association Joins with the Banking Industry to Petition for Remedial Measures for Re-Mortgaging; Plans to Activate Real Estate Leverage at the Same Time; Hopes for the Early Establishment of a Real Estate Bank</p>
<p>Shanghai's real estate industry has been affected by the global economic recession, resulting in a sharp drop in prices and the disappearance of transactions. Real estate companies have been unable to maintain operations, and the number of bankruptcies has been increasing. The plan to issue negotiable securities ultimately failed. Since the implementation of the new monetary system policy, the real estate industry has indeed shown activity, but it has been too deeply affected by years of decline, so it soon returned to its original state. Since the organization of the Real Estate Industry Association, the chairman of the association, Shen Tianxin, and others have been planning to activate real estate leverage. At the same time, in view of the previous method of real estate re-mortgaging (for example, A mortgages real estate to B, and B re-mortgages it to C. Later, after B goes bankrupt, C's priority claim is lost due to the re-mortgaging), it is considered inappropriate. A special letter was sent to the banking industry and the money industry to jointly petition the Ministry of Finance for remedial measures. The banking industry and the money industry have now separately studied the legal issues. After the study is completed, they will jointly consult and submit a report to the Ministry for review and handling. They also hope that the government will quickly establish a real estate bank in the shortest possible period to directly rescue the dying real estate industry and indirectly rescue the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Motion to Restrict Artificial Silk Imports; Ministry of Finance Replied that it Should be Discussed Later; In the Current Situation, the Focus is on Investigating Smuggled Goods, Not on Restrictions <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai China National Products Maintenance Association previously petitioned the Ministry of Finance to order the promotion of domestic goods and the establishment of artificial silk factories, and to gradually prohibit the import of artificial silk. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance stating that the China National Products Maintenance Association's application has been received. This case has been forwarded to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and distributed to the two ministries. The request to promote the use of domestic goods and establish artificial silk factories is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry, and should be reviewed and handled by the two ministries. As for the request to gradually restrict the quantity of imported artificial silk and other textiles and gradually prohibit them, this Ministry has thoroughly investigated. According to customs records, the imported value of artificial silk and other textiles, artificial silk satin, and artificial silk-interwoven textiles, as well as artificial silk-interwoven wool and cotton textiles, totaled more than 690,000 yuan in 1933, and only more than 390,000 yuan in 1934. This shows that since the import tax rate on artificial silk and other textiles has been increased, the normal import volume has been sharply reduced, and there is no need to restrict it again. As for the tax-evading artificial silk and other textiles in North China, new regulations for punishing tax evasion and regulations for inspection and distribution have been newly formulated, and inspection offices have been established on various railways to order serious investigation and strict implementation. The finished products woven from artificial silk have been stipulated to be included in the list of items to be inspected. In the future, the trend of smuggling will gradually subside, and the volume of imports should be reduced. Therefore, from the current situation, the focus on imported artificial silk and other textiles is on investigating smuggled goods, not on restrictions. The request to restrict and prohibit should be discussed later. In addition to replying to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, this telegram is sent for your information. Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the general public in China lacks knowledge of the national flag. Therefore, the Central Government recently established uniform rectification measures. Since the promotion in Shanghai, most citizens have purchased the flags, but many still do not understand how to use them. Therefore, during the inspection on July 9, one or two households were found to have hung the national flag upside down, and most did not raise the national flag to the top of the pole, and the flagpoles were of varying lengths. The inspectors have already corrected this. Yesterday, staff members of the Party and National Flag Uniform Promotion Association passed through a certain neighborhood in Baxianqiao and saw a cigarette and paper shop actually sewing the Party and National Flags together to use as an awning to block the sun. They were informed that the Party and National Flags represent the nation and are very solemn and must not be used for other purposes, which would be ridiculed by foreigners. Also, a certain teahouse on Dapu Road has been hanging the flags day and night since they were hung. Staff members of the association also informed them that the national flag should be raised at sunrise and lowered at sunset, and it is not necessary to hang it unless it is a memorial day. In general, if the above situations are encountered, they must be corrected at any time so that everyone can understand.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve China's raw silk, instructed the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to prepare for the quality inspection of raw silk exports and scheduled it to be implemented on August 1. Miao Zhongxiu, the director of the Silk Group of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, went to Beijing to seek instructions some time ago and has now returned to Shanghai. He told reporters that the inspection of raw silk exports has been decided to be implemented starting August 1. All the measures have been decided, and it is not planned to convene another meeting of manufacturers' representatives. The standards for the quality inspection of raw silk will be formulated and implemented on February 1 of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Ministry of Railways Unifies Joint Transportation Methods for Various Routes, Stipulating Five Items for Compliance <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, noting inconsistencies in the methods for handling joint transportation of goods across various routes, which caused difficulties for local railway bureaus in managing this business, has selected key aspects of joint transportation and stipulated five unified methods. These are to be implemented uniformly across all routes. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, upon receiving the order to comply with the aforementioned methods, have instructed their respective traffic departments to follow them. The details of these methods are as follows: 1. The method of payment for joint transportation of goods, whether in full carloads or less-than-carload lots, shall be uniformly handled. 2. Actively implement methods for collecting payment on behalf of others for goods. 3. When joint transportation of educational materials is offered, the special price for educational materials prescribed by the Ministry should be applied using the long-distance reduction method for joint transportation. 4. For sixth-class goods and goods with freight rates equal to or lower than sixth-class, with the exception of those stipulated in Article 7 of the General Rules for Freight Transportation, which may not be handled with guaranteed joint transportation, and with the temporary exception of coal, coke, ash, and slag, all other goods should be handled with guaranteed joint transportation. 5. Railway stations should uniformly implement the practice of issuing receipts for guaranteed joint transportation of goods on behalf of other routes.</p>

<p>In recent years, China's basic chemical industry has made significant progress. For example, the quantity of various acidic chemical products produced by the Tianli Alkali Plant has increased year by year. Consequently, there has been a sharp reduction in the import of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and other acidic chemicals this year. The import of acidic chemicals into Shanghai in the first half of this year was 1,???387,?789 gallons, a decrease of 884,?299 gallons compared to 2,?272,?488 gallons in the same period last year.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Bureau is sparing no effort in planning and implementing welfare projects for the common people. In addition to constructing new villages for the common people in various parts of the city for citizens to reside in, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has already established loan offices for the poor in the Zhabei and Nanshi districts to assist ordinary people engaged in small businesses in terms of their livelihood and economy. The Municipal Government, recognizing that the number of citizens in the special districts engaging in small businesses is increasing day by day, plans to add loan offices for the poor in the first and second special districts to universally assist and support them. After several discussions, it has been decided to establish one or two such offices, following the example of the city center, to provide small loans. The Municipal Government has instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to take full responsibility for the implementation of this project. Once the sites have been selected, the Municipal Finance Bureau will be instructed to allocate funds from the budget for the 25th year to initiate and organize the project.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Should Union Dues Receipts Have Revenue Stamps Affixed? General Labor Union Petitions for Interpretation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Municipal General Labor Union yesterday submitted petitions to the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance stating: "The Members' Dyeing Trade Union, a subordinate association, reported that the revenue authority's inspectors considered receipts for monthly dues paid by all workers of the Ruihe Factory lacking revenue stamps, and filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court. The subordinate association, upon receiving the summons, based on Article 34 of the Public Association Law, 'Public associations are exempt from income tax, business tax, and registration tax,' and Article 3, paragraph 3 of the General Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, 'Vouchers issued by government agencies or autonomous organizations for handling public funds or public money,' and paragraph 8 ('Documents used internally by public or private organizations that do not create external rights or obligations'), various provisions, dispatched personnel to the court to argue the case and also petitioned the relevant authorities and requested the court to suspend the case and also requested the central government to give an interpretation. The Shanghai District Court misinterpreted the articles and, before the Central government has given an interpretation, arbitrarily imposed a fine of nine yuan through a criminal ruling. This action by the court not only distorts central laws but also affects the entire union economy. It is appropriate to petition the relevant authorities to sue the court and request the legislative authority to give an interpretation with clear stipulations for compliance." According to the above, Article 34 of the Public Association Law stipulates: "Public associations are exempt from income tax, business tax, and registration tax," and Article 3, paragraph 3 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates: "Vouchers issued by government agencies or autonomous organizations for handling public funds or public money," and paragraph 8 of the same article stipulates: "Documents used internally by public or private organizations that do not create external rights or obligations," all have provisions for exemption from stamp tax. Since the public association is an autonomous organization of workers, its dues receipts are vouchers issued for handling public money, and there is no doubt that they are exempt from stamp tax. Moreover, the dues receipts do not create external rights or obligations, and according to the Stamp Tax Law, they are even more obviously exempt. Furthermore, according to the provisions of item 4 of the tax rate table in Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, "Vouchers or ledgers issued by public enterprises for taking or remitting money, or public ledgers used by workers in various industries to withdraw wages, are exempt from stamp tax." Since public ledgers used by workers to withdraw wages are exempt from stamp tax, it is inappropriate to classify union dues receipts as money or goods receipts under item 2 of Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law and impose a fine. The case involves national laws and regulations and the union economy, and is of utmost importance. Therefore, this petition is submitted to your (Yuan) (Ministry) for interpretation to facilitate compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Workers at Shenfeng Dyeing Factory Went on Strike Last Night <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Shenfeng Dyeing Factory, located at No. 200 Huangyu Road at the end of Yinxiang Port in this city, was established in the autumn of the year before last. It has only a few dozen workers and is not very large in scale. The factory owner, Chen Shaoji, also serves as the manager. The workers' wages have always been meager, relying entirely on wine money. The wine money is divided according to a ratio of four for the workers and six for the factory, after the workers are paid a fixed salary. The remaining 40% of the wine money belongs to the factory owner. However, the factory suddenly deducted another 20% from the workers' wine money as savings without providing workers' savings certificates. Moreover, when business reached more than 10,000 pieces, the wages of all workers were deducted, and they were only given wine money. The workers have suffered deeply. Recently, the workers, unable to endure the factory's oppression, requested mediation from party and government agencies, demanding improved treatment. However, the factory owner ignored them completely. Unable to find any other means, the workers went on strike together yesterday (the 24th). Several workers were guarding the factory gate, and the order was still good. They are now waiting for party and government agencies to mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Zhejiang Cocoon Association Submits to Zhejiang Provincial Government: Request for Eye-Witness Review of Cocoon Reeling Deduction; Public Interest Yong Cocoon's Poor Quality Deduction Disparate from Hangzhou Factory Reeling Deduction <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Federation of Lianzhu Lane, Aiwenyi Road, this city, submitted a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting an on-site review of cocoon reeling deduction by original cocoon farmers to ensure accuracy. The Public Interest Yong Cocoon Firm stated in its letter: "We received the Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Silk Control Committee's Sixth District Receipt Office Notice No. 12, which stated: 'On July 16th of this year, we received Instruction No. 2048 from the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee, which stated: 'After investigation, the cocoon samples submitted by the district that did not meet the central price have been test-reeled by our Hangzhou Silk Factory. It has been determined that the Liu family cocoon firms, including Tiancheng, Xianghe, Public Interest, Xiangxi, Hengchang, and Tonghe, should be punished separately. We hereby send a copy of the reeling deduction table for each firm and order you to comply and execute the order and report the compliance situation for verification.' We are sending this notice in addition to separate notices to the firms. The cocoon firms are ordered to quickly pay the fines in full within five days and submit them here for transfer, without delay, to avoid subsequent follow-up and tracking. This notice includes Public Interest Yong Cocoon Firm's selection deduction of 78.40, light deduction of 424.18.33, specified central price of 20.00, difference per dan of 1.77, total cocoons received of 1807.61, and fine amount of 6398.94, etc.' After investigation, the spring cocoons received by Public Interest Yong this year were of poor quality and had been test-reeled by the Shanghai Beautiful Silk Factory, with a light deduction of 508.0, which is greatly different from the Hangzhou Factory's reeling deduction, with a difference of 84.02. Public Interest Yong is located in the Linshang District of South Lake, and the</p>
<p>spring cocoons collected over the years have a reeling deduction of more than 600 catties. This year's cocoons are compressed and of low quality, so it is unusual that the reeling deduction is superior to the previous years. There must be errors in the reeling assessment. Moreover, the spring cocoons are still sealed and stored in the Shanghai Beautiful Silk Factory (untouched). Therefore, we request that your company forward this letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering the Control Committee to send personnel to the Beautiful Silk Factory to retrieve samples for re-reeling to determine the accurate deduction. Only then can we be convinced whether a fine should be imposed. Attached is a reeling list from the Beautiful Silk Factory, please review it in detail to assist in the matter. On this basis, the Hangzhou Silk Factory and the Beautiful Silk Factory's test reeling of the cocoons of the Public Interest Yong Cocoon Firm has a large difference in reeling deduction, so it is necessary to retrieve samples for re-reeling. Our Silk Factory's test reeling</p>
<p>cannot be considered definitive. Often, the reeling deduction of the same cocoon firm's cocoons by the same silk factory is inconsistent. Only after all the cocoons have been reeled can the exact number of deductions be obtained. Now that the Hangzhou Silk Factory's test reeling is not limited to the original cocoon farmers and is only a one-time reeling, how can it be credible? Our Association believes that there are no regulations in this spring cocoon collection method that prescribe penalties for those below the central price. Arbitrary punishments after the fact seem inappropriate. Even if we take a step back, this test reeling is related to fines and should be conducted with the original cocoon farmers present to avoid criticism. It is also appropriate to choose two or more reputable silk factories to test reel simultaneously. Even if the accurate reeling deduction cannot be obtained, it will at least show fairness. This is our association's opinion. We respectfully submit this document to your government requesting the Control Committee to handle the matter according to this method. Only then can the Public Interest Yong Cocoon Firm review the deduction with their own eyes. We respectfully submit this to the Zhejiang Provincial Government (attached is a reeling list)."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has reached an agreement with Mr. Tang Yize, owner of the Zhejiang Jianying Studio, regarding the amount and procedures for loaning funds for tung oil in Zhejiang Province. Jianying then summoned cooperative instructors from various counties and representatives from industrial and financial institutions to the province to discuss the distribution of loans for tung oil producing counties. Now that the tung nut harvest is imminent, tung farmers urgently need cash assistance. The bank is ready to provide the promised 500,000 yuan in tung oil loans. Once the distribution amounts are decided, loans will be granted to well-organized cooperatives, which will then re-lend to the farmers. It is agreed that when granting the loans, the people's banks or industrial financial institutions in the tung oil producing counties must match 30% of the loan, with the bank only providing 70%. In the future, when the loans are repaid, the bank should be repaid first to ensure the security of the business.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Zhang Xiuying, a Woman from Beiping, is Deceived into Coming to Shanghai and Rescued <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Tong She, Zhang Xiuying, a 19-year-old woman from Ningbo who resided in Beiping, was deceived into coming to Shanghai for medical treatment and was in danger of becoming destitute. Yesterday, she was sent to the China Women and Children Relief Association by the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association in Shanghai for temporary care and to inform her family to come to Shanghai to claim her. The matter was quite tortuous, showing how treacherous people's hearts can be. The details are as follows. A Pitiful Background: The deceived woman was said to be educated and had studied in a certain elementary school in Shanghai before the Shanghai Incident, so her writing is quite clear. According to her account, her name is Zhang Xiuying, she is 19 years old, and is from Ningbo. When she was six years old, she was given up by her biological parents and adopted by Zhang Shougen, a fellow villager, as his stepdaughter (Zhang is a merchant in Tianjin). Soon after, she came to Shanghai with her stepmother, Zhang Wang, and lived at No. 3 Mingde Lane, Malong Road. At that time, her stepmother funded her education. However, after the Shanghai Incident broke out, she returned to her hometown in Ningbo with her stepmother. Deceived into Coming to Shanghai: On March 16th of this year, her stepfather took his family to live at No. 17 Julian Hutong, Beiping. However, she has been suffering from scrofula recently, and has not been cured since residing in Beiping. Unexpectedly, a neighbor woman from her time in Shanghai (whom she calls Auntie, name unknown), who had been close to her stepmother, recently sent a letter to Beiping saying that there was a specialized doctor in Shanghai who treated scrofula very effectively, and that if she wanted to be treated, the neighbor woman could come to Beiping to accompany her daughter to Shanghai for treatment. Her stepmother believed her, so the neighbor woman came to Beiping at the beginning of the month to accompany her to Shanghai for treatment.</p>
<p>Never to Return</p>
<p>On the way, the neighbor woman took away the 120 yuan in cash and the jewelry she had brought with her in the name of protecting them. By the time they arrived in Shanghai, the woman took her to see a front-facing room at No. 7 Ciai Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, agreed to a rent of ten yuan, and paid a deposit of one yuan. That afternoon, around 7:30 PM, the woman went out on the pretext of finding a doctor and never returned. Only then did she realize she had been deceived and began to cry loudly. After learning the details from the landlord, the landlord also wanted to force her out of the house. Just when she was at her wits' end, she suddenly remembered that she had a classmate named Wang Aizhen when she was studying in Shanghai, and heard that she was studying at an egg factory, but did not know the name of the factory.</p>
<p>Saved in Dire Straits</p>
<p>After inquiring, she learned that there was a Maochang Egg Factory on Huangpu Road, so she hired a car and went straight to the factory to inquire, and recounted her experiences. The factory staff, Jin Shaonan, etc., took pity on the young woman and the unfortunate situation, and sent someone to accompany her to the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association in Shanghai and sent a letter to the association, saying: "Dear Sirs, Zhang Xiuying, a woman from Ningbo, residing in Beiping, came to Shanghai to treat scrofula and was deceived by her aunt out of her money and jewelry, and is now destitute on the sea, homeless. We respectfully request that your association inform the Fellow-Countrymen Association in Beiping to have her family come to claim her, so that the family can be reunited. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely, Jin Shaonan, Wang Hengtong, Zhang Xuming, Sun Wenheng."</p>
<p>Sent to Women and Children Relief Association</p>
<p>After learning the situation, the association sent another letter to the Fellow-Countrymen Association in Beiping to inform her family. The woman was sent to the China Women and Children Relief Association for temporary care. The letter to the Women and Children Relief Association stated: "Dear Sirs, Zhang Xiuying, a woman from Ningbo, resides with her parents in Beiping. This time, she was deceived by her aunt into coming to Shanghai to treat scrofula, and all the money and jewelry she brought with her were taken away, leaving her stranded in Shanghai, with no way to return home. We are sending the woman under escort, and request that your association take her in for temporary care. All expenses for food and lodging will be covered by our association.

<p>Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, who was appointed by the government to go to the United States with Mr. Chen Guangfu to discuss the silver issue and investigate economic conditions in various places, reported on the situation of international trade in Europe and the United States and the recent situation of overseas Chinese in various places at the meeting of the Local Association on the 21st evening. These are all important current issues, and the reporter of Da Gong She has recorded them for the reference of those who are concerned about international trade and the situation of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The mission abroad for international trade and the process of contacting various parties have already been reported in the press. Originally, I (Guo himself) planned to investigate the local economic situation in Washington, but since I was going to New York a week later, I did not have time to go into detail. I will tell you (Guo said) about the process of contact and what is most relevant to international trade and China. When we were abroad, Japanese newspapers reported that we were buying arms, which was unfounded. Regarding trade between China and the United States, it has plummeted this year. Our country's bronzeware and antiques imported into the United States accounted for 50% of the percentage two years ago, but by last year, it suddenly dropped to 2%. Tea dropped from 39% to 6%. The export of tung oil was more than 30 million yuan last year due to the development and widespread use of the U.S. industry. However, due to the unevenness of the quality, the purchasing power of the United States gradually decreased, and Japanese oil took the opportunity to dump it on the market. According to a US report, the quality of tung oil produced in the country is better than that of our country after chemical analysis. Therefore, our country's exports were severely hit in foreign trade. If the authorities can actively improve the export commodities and standardize the standards, there may be hope of recovery in the future.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Overseas Chinese: The recent situation of overseas Chinese in various parts of the United States is also affected by the failure to improve commodities. The commercial power of overseas Chinese in San Francisco has always been one of the best, but in recent years it has been in a slump. The Japanese are taking advantage of the situation to compete, and their products can cater to the tastes of Americans. Because it is difficult to compete, most of them have closed down, and the commercial power of the Japanese is growing day by day. They have also organized commodity exhibitions in the area, on the one hand using advertising to attract Americans to buy, and on the other hand guiding the improvement of commodities. Therefore, the status of overseas Chinese in various parts of the United States has been greatly damaged. The local impression of silk and electrical appliances produced in our country is still good in Singapore, because their prices are also lower than those in the local area. From this, it can be seen that if our country wants to restore its lost foreign commercial power, it must first start by improving the quality and standards of domestic goods, and the authorities should also have considerable restrictions so that its sales have a sound organization.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce: The reason why U.S. commerce can develop so well is mostly due to the measures taken by the government authorities. Its organizations for assisting commerce include the domestic and foreign trade bureaus, with 25 branches domestically and 35 branches abroad, cooperative organizations, and the Bureau of Commerce, which control commercial power and establish import and export banks to provide loans and insurance, and export loan insurance. It promotes and supports commerce, exchanges commercial treaties, and on the one hand tries to limit the quantity of imported goods, and on the other hand encourages the export of commodities to dump them on foreign markets. Therefore, the industry and commerce in the United States are flourishing. I hope that our government should also adopt its strengths and gradually progress.</p>

<p>Zhang Datong, Captain of the Detective General Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Deputy Captain Fang Zhenyu, specially convened an important meeting at the General Team Headquarters at around 9:00 AM yesterday. The leaders and deputy leaders of the various squadrons and the foremen of the detectives were all present. It was reported that the content of the meeting focused on the arrest of the murderer in the case of the Japanese national Kayano, which was particularly important. Zhang gave instructions to the participants and set another three-day deadline, requiring each of them to pay attention to the matter. The meeting did not end until 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Shanghai Silk Industry Bank to Hold Temporary Shareholders' Meeting Tomorrow: Report on Cooperation with Jiangsu, Correcting New Business Policies <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, in order to expand its business and rescue the silk industry, has earnestly cooperated with the Jiangsu Bank. At the same time, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are supporting it. Lu Zidong, General Manager of Jiangsu Bank, also serves as General Manager, and a new Deputy General Manager is hired to assist him. Warehouses and offices are planned for the silk areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to undertake mortgage loans as much as possible. A temporary shareholders' meeting will be held at the bank in Hankou at 4:00 PM tomorrow to report on the new business policies to improve operations.</p>
<p>Also reported, the silk industry of this city has been established for five years, with a capital of 1.2 million and eight branches, and its business has been developing. Recently, unfortunately, misunderstandings have arisen due to personnel relations. In order to refresh its reputation and revitalize its business, the bank hired Lu Zidong, General Manager of Jiangsu Bank, as General Manager of the Silk Industry Bank on the 16th of this month, and the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Jiangsu Bank have agreed to provide full assistance. After the reorganization is approved, the business prospects are even more optimistic. It is rumored that the silk industry and the Jiangsu banks will merge, which is a misunderstanding of Lu Zidong's concurrent position as General Manager of the two banks. Jiangsu is a provincial bank and cannot be easily merged with a commercial bank.</p>

<p>Lawyer Hu Shu, also known as Yangchu, was from Yixing, Jiangsu. In June of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member, and established an office at No. 83, Xixiang Kangli, Meibaige Road, Public Concession, to practice law in Shanghai. However, Hu suddenly suffered a stroke some time ago due to his obesity. Western and Chinese doctors were called to treat him, but they were ineffective, and he has now passed away. Hu's family has already reported this to the Shanghai Lawyers Association, requesting that the courts at all levels remove Lawyer Hu Shu from the membership and the association.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Wang Wenhuan's Wallet Found Empty; Fang Douwen Arrested in Nanjing and Sent Back to Shanghai for Theft <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Fang Douwen, Wang Wenhuan, and Wang Xingwu, all from Anhui and engaged in the tea business, shared a residence at No. 4 Yuan Fengrun Tea Shop in Yi Ru Lane, 646 Tiantong Road. Between the 14th and 15th of this month, Wang Wenhuan noticed that 1,800 yuan in legal tender had mysteriously disappeared. Fang Douwen, who lived with him, also left that evening. Wang suspected Fang of theft and reported it to the Detective Department of the police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>It was not until the day before yesterday that they learned Fang was in Nanjing. Consequently, Chinese Detective Zhao Qingkui requested official documents from the First Special Court and rushed to the capital to arrest Fang Douwen. He was brought back to Shanghai and detained at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Mr. Qian Jiu, filed a public prosecution for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Code, outlining the case. He stated that the victim, Wang Wenhuan, and the defendant, Fang Douwen, along with Wang Xingwu, were all tea merchants living in the same room. Wang Wenhuan's tea had been sold, and the money was deposited in the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Wang had recently withdrawn 2,000 yuan from the bank. After exchanging 200 yuan for five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, he placed the remaining 1,800 legal tender notes in his wallet without sealing it.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at one o'clock, the plaintiff went out shopping and returned at eight o'clock. Wang Xingwu also went to the China Hotel to visit friends at six o'clock in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, the next day (the 15th), the plaintiff opened his wallet and discovered that 1,800 yuan in banknotes had disappeared. Furthermore, the defendant had left a note stating that he received an urgent phone call from Nanjing at nine o'clock on the 14th and had to leave immediately, without taking his luggage, saying he would return to Shanghai in two or three days. The plaintiff then reported it to the police station, but because he did not know the defendant's whereabouts in Nanjing, he could not be arrested. It was not until the 20th of this month that another tea merchant residing in the Yuan Fengrun Tea Shop, He Shengyuan, received a letter from the defendant, entrusting him to take care of his luggage, revealing that the defendant was staying at Chen Gongguan at No. 2 Mogan Road in Nanjing. The plaintiff informed the police station, and detectives went to the capital, transferred him to Shanghai.</p>
<p>At the police station, the defendant admitted to stealing the banknotes. Thirty-five yuan in legal tender was found on his person. He stated that he had spent 600 yuan, deposited 900 yuan in the Nanyang Shop on Sixiang Street in Nanjing, and 200 yuan with Xu Jili on Hongwu Road in Nanjing. Therefore, the case requested a postponement to recover the money.</p>
<p>The defendant, Fang Douwen, denied the theft, claiming that on that evening, a former legislator surnamed [omitted] called Yang Qi, who lived on [omitted] Road, instructing him to go to Nanjing overnight. Therefore, he rushed to Nanjing.</p>
<p>The presiding judge reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to be detained pending a retrial in seven days.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Jointly Opened Meihua Bank, Found Malfeasance After Collapse <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Three Englishmen – Yale, manager of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. at 17 Jiangxi Road, Munroe, accountant at Yi Mow Lee, and Maleto – recently hired lawyers to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court in their capacity as directors of the Meihua Bank at 230 Jiujiang Road, which had been open for less than two months. They accused Gu Yubo, the Chinese general manager of the bank, of fraud and breach of trust. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng summoned them for questioning. The plaintiffs all appeared in court, but the defendant, Gu Yubo, did not appear because the address in the plaintiff's complaint, Gu's friend's home at 374 Haifang Road, was used for service of the summons, which he refused to accept.</p>
<p>During the hearing, the plaintiff Yale testified that the defendant, Gu Yubo, had initially prepared to establish the Daxin Industrial Bank, but due to shareholder issues, it did not open. Subsequently, he partnered with the plaintiffs to open the Meihua Bank, which was registered as Meihua Bank Limited with the British government in Hong Kong. It opened on April 8th of this year but collapsed on April 27th. Gu then went into hiding. After accountants Yi Mow Lee and audit staff member McKessack audited the accounts, they discovered that the defendant had used a fictitious name, Shanji, to overdraft 11,000 yuan from Meihua Bank. He also forged the official stamp of Meihua Bank and issued promissory notes, which he discounted with creditors such as the Xinkang Money Exchange, totaling over 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>However, it is not yet clear whether there were other embezzlement or misappropriation. There is also concern that there may be other accomplices involved, and further accusations may be added. The defendant's current residence is uncertain, and a warrant for his arrest is requested for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Judge Huang reviewed the testimony and adjourned the hearing to the 31st, ordering the defendant to be summoned to court for questioning.</p>

<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, the smuggling of rayon, white sugar, and other goods has decreased compared to before. This is because the volume of these items being smuggled into North and Central China in recent days has been so large that it is difficult to sell them all at once, leading to stockpiling. However, the [derogatory term for Japanese] are determined to undermine our country's tax revenue to profit handsomely, leaving no means untried. Recently, they have innovated by smuggling marine products such as sea cucumber, dried scallops, shrimp, shark fins, as well as winter mushrooms, straw mushrooms, and other items, which are steadily imported and flood this city and the interior. It is reported that in addition to smuggling the above goods, the [derogatory term for Japanese] also use their special influence to transport opium, heroin, and other prohibited goods, roaming around and arbitrarily refusing to allow our Chinese military police to inspect their luggage for contraband.</p>

<p>Kang Yuan Canning Factory Co., Ltd. held its 13th joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 24th of this month at the New Asia Hotel. The directors and supervisors present included Xue Ziliang, Qian Xin Zhi, Zhang Gongquan, Shi Haifeng, Jian Yujie, Zhu Yinjiang, Du Yuesheng, Liu Xingyao, Zhuang Dewei, Liang Ziyuan, Gao Langwen, Xiang Kangyuan, Ruan Weiyang, and more than ten others. Director Xue Ziliang was elected as the temporary chairman. The directors present nominated standing directors and the chairman of the board. The consensus was to re-elect Zhang Gongquan, Shi Haifeng, and Wang Zhihua. However, former Chairman Zhang declined due to his duties in Beijing, emphasizing that he could not handle both positions simultaneously. As a result, Qian Xinzhi was elected as the Chairman of the Board, and Shi Haifeng and Wang Zhixin were elected as standing directors.</p>
<p>Subsequently, General Manager Xiang reported on the business situation for the first half of the year. In terms of business, orders increased by 41% compared to the same period last year, and sales increased by 5%. However, expenses decreased by 20% compared to last year. The directors and supervisors were very satisfied with the effective cost-cutting measures implemented over the past six months. They also discussed the shareholders' meeting resolutions and instructed the directors to find ways to raise new capital. It was decided that each director and supervisor should raise enough capital by the end of August to facilitate the company's capital increase registration and the issuance of shares. After the meeting, the company distributed the latest toy masks and other products, took photos, and adjourned.</p>

<p>Regarding the question of whether the number of public rickshaws can be reduced, the relevant departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council have recently had detailed discussions. The board of directors also considered it at a recent regular meeting and decided not to reduce the number temporarily during this economic downturn to avoid causing unemployment for rickshaw pullers. However, the number of rickshaw pullers who are naturally eliminated each year is also not small. In the future, the Municipal Council intends not to replace this naturally eliminated number, as long as it is less than two thousand people. In this way, the number of rickshaw pullers will gradually decrease, and their living conditions should gradually improve.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Renewed Hearing on Objection to Execution Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The case between Qinghai, the abbot of Qingliang Temple on Xinzha Road, and the Tonghe Foreign Firm's objection to execution was renewed yesterday morning at 8 AM by Judge Wang Qufei of the First Special Court in the Tenth Civil Tribunal. Onlookers included about thirty people, such as Chinese and Western gentlemen from the temple's maintenance committee and representatives from various organizations.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Lu Qi, stated that the second defendant, Sheng Yuyou, was in England and therefore could not sign an authorization. Therefore, his agent lawyer was not legally authorized to act on his behalf. However, the situation in this case is complicated, and in order to fully understand the case, it is necessary to explain in detail the previous lawsuits between Tonghe Foreign Firm and Qingliang Temple, the lease signed by both parties, and whether Tonghe Foreign Firm truly received the mortgage and has the right to sue.</p>
<p>The use of the disputed land in the Xin family garden by Xiaoliang Temple and the old houses on it dates back to around 1921. Initially, it was actually donated to the temple by Sheng Zhuangshi, Sheng Yuyou's grandmother. Therefore, after the Qi-Lu War in 1924, the plaintiff began fundraising to build new houses, such as temples and monastic halls, totaling more than one hundred rooms. By 1927, when the National Government investigated and confiscated Sheng's property, Sheng Zhuangshi, on the one hand, wanted to avoid government confiscation and, on the other hand, to prevent the temple from being unable to complete the construction within the five-year deadline after receiving the donation. Therefore, Zhuangshi unilaterally wrote a lease contract, instructing the plaintiff to stamp it as a win-win solution. Unexpectedly, Zhuangshi died shortly after exchanging contracts.</p>
<p>Initially, the Sheng family raised no objections. However, last year, Tonghe Foreign Firm, in the name of a mortgagee, came forward to sue for relocation and delivery of the house. In the original trial, it was not that the court did not notice that Tonghe Foreign Firm was not qualified as a plaintiff and had no right to sue. However, Sheng Yuyou testified that everything had already been transferred to Tonghe, so the original trial accepted the case. Moreover, it was found that the subject of the lawsuit was claimed to be over 350,000 yuan, while the original trial was decided in the summary court. Furthermore, in the first three hearings, the two defendants never presented the original</p>
<p>mortgage contract</p>
<p>to the court. The English version and translation on file are different in many places, and even the surnames of the mortgagor and guarantor are missing. Furthermore, the translation of the mortgage contract of the two defendants includes all the temples built and unfinished by the plaintiff on the disputed land as collateral. Even if it is mortgaged, it is not only in violation of the law but also absurd. How can the landowner have the right to mortgage the temples built by the temple, and even the unfinished houses can be mortgaged?</p>
<p>This is truly a strange story.</p>
<p>The plaintiff filed this lawsuit for objection to execution because their ownership was taken away.</p>
<p>At this point, Zuo Detao, the agent of Sheng Yuyou, stated that the plaintiff's lawsuit for objection to execution against Tonghe should require the plaintiff to respond to what request they have of Sheng Yuyou. This is a preliminary question. The court immediately asked lawyer Lu what</p>
<p>requests are there of Sheng?</p>
<p>Lawyer Lu replied that the plaintiff has no relationship with Tonghe. Because Tonghe, after receiving the mortgage, overstepped their authority and filed a lawsuit, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages due to the execution error. However, who the disputed house belongs to is Sheng's business. If Sheng does not object to the plaintiff's request, then the lawsuit against Sheng can be withdrawn. If Sheng does not agree with the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff will naturally sue them together. The court stated that there are still procedural issues in this case and that the summons will be issued after a ruling.</p>

<p>Peng Shou Zeng, a native of Gaoyou and owner of a broker shop at 738 Huade Road, is known for his violent temper. Four years ago, he married a woman surnamed Zhou from his hometown, who was now 26 years old. The morning before last, the couple had a dispute over household matters, and Peng allegedly beat his wife, causing her injuries. She fell to the ground and cried out in pain. Peng escorted her to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. However, that evening, Peng brought her home. At 11:45 PM, she suddenly died. Subsequently, the Yulin Road police station received a report and sent detectives to investigate. They transported the body to the Fei Lun Road morgue and took Peng into custody at the police station.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested detention for further investigation. Judge Su granted the request. At around 10 AM, Prosecutor Zhang was dispatched by the Prosecutor's Office to the morgue to inspect the body. Immediately after examining the body, he ascended to the public case. Zhou Caiyuan, the deceased's brother, claimed that he worked at a school on Qiqihar Road. After his sister was injured, he was notified and went to see her. His sister told him that her little stomach had been kicked by her husband with a leather shoe, but it was unintentional, so she asked for leniency. Mao Yushi, a woman from Yangzhou, testified that she lived in the stove room of the defendant's house and returned late after leaving early. She said that the couple often fought and played. That morning, she only saw Peng slightly hit his wife on the back, but she did not see anything else.</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant denied kicking. In order to clarify the truth of the deceased's death, Mr. Zhang ordered an autopsy on the already deceased Peng Zhoushi. As the cause of death is currently unknown, it will be handed over to a forensic doctor for autopsy and further verification. After the autopsy, the body will be handed over to the deceased's brother, Zhou Caiyuan, for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Approved by the Municipal Council <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government issued the decimal new currency, the Shanghai Tram Company has been calculating copper coins at three per fen, which is extremely convenient. Recently, the company submitted a request to the Municipal Council to revise the fare table, calculating everything using the new currency system. This matter was discussed by the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee a few days ago. It was the general opinion that the purpose of this change in fares was to promote the new currency and facilitate passengers, and that there was no intention to increase fares. The calculation method is based on the recent half-fen standard, and the Public Bus Company had already been granted the same request in mid-March of this year. Therefore, it seems appropriate to approve the Tram Company's request. It has now been submitted to the board of directors for approval and is expected to be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Paper umbrellas made in our country are sold in large quantities in the Southeast Asian islands. However, in recent years, sales have been decreasing daily. According to investigations, on the one hand, it is because Western umbrellas produced in Japan are being promoted more widely in that area, encroaching on the market for Chinese umbrellas. On the other hand, it is because the quality of Chinese umbrellas has been deteriorating, and merchants are unwilling to sell them. The oil used in Chinese umbrellas was originally tung oil, but in recent years, the price of tung oil has been high, causing umbrella merchants to switch to mixed oils, which causes the umbrella paper to tear and break. The Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Southeast Asia sent a letter to Chinese umbrella merchants, asking them to improve the situation. It is now known that the Umbrella Merchants Association has sent personnel to Zhejiang and Guangdong to investigate and provide guidance at any time, in order to ensure the purity of the quality of paper umbrellas, thereby reversing the decline in sales in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau of this city yesterday sent letters to the Municipal Party Committee, the Public Security Bureau, and other agencies, stating that they had received Letter No. 8529 from the Health Bureau, which stated that Pan Qinzhai, a Chinese medicine practitioner from Tongji Shantang at 74 Tangjiawan Road, had submitted a request to register a clinic for providing medical treatment. The bureau had sent personnel to investigate and found that the clinic's equipment was extremely simple. However, since Shantang is a public charitable organization, the bureau did not know whether it had been approved by your bureau for registration and requested a reply for handling. After sending personnel to investigate, it was reported that Pan Qinzhai, a Chinese medicine practitioner from Taizhou, stated that the hall was opened in April of this year, and he was solely responsible, with no organization or charter. Those who seek treatment pay a fee of two jiao, but medicine is free. However, the hall's equipment is extremely simple, with only three or four small bottles of medicine. The words "Tongji Shantang" are prominently displayed in the middle of the road, which is very conspicuous. Therefore, there is a suspicion that the hall is a personal clinic using the name of a charitable organization to attract customers, which should be cracked down on. In addition to ordering the organization to be disbanded and all signboards removed, you are requested to investigate and take action.</p>

<p>Jiang Xisheng, 42 years old from Changzhou, has been an employee at the fruit store opened by Lu Youqing west of the Diaoqiao Bridge in Ximen, Changyi. Due to the relationship between purchasing goods and accounts, Jiang was often ordered by his boss to travel between Shanghai and Changzhou. The day before yesterday, Jiang again took a car to Shanghai and stayed at room 22 of the Weizhen Hotel on Erma Road. Yesterday afternoon, Jiang and his son-in-law Lu Zikun (currently in the glass business on Huade Road) and another friend went to the Tongkang Vegetable and Fruit Market in Xiaodongmen to purchase a large quantity of fruit. Then, the three of them took the five hundred yuan they had collected and deposited it into the Bank of Communications. As they walked out holding the passbook, when they reached the vicinity of the dock of the French Concession Company, five bandits suddenly jumped out of a car parked by the roadside, brandishing pistols, forbidding them from making a sound. They kidnapped Jiang into the car and searched him all over, only finding a passbook. The gang was extremely disappointed and returned the passbook, ordering Jiang to get out of the car. The car sped away without a trace.</p>
<p>When the gang kidnapped Jiang into the car, his son-in-law Lu Zikun and another friend ran to the police station to report it. By the time the police sent detectives to pursue them, the bandits' car had already disappeared. After escaping danger, Jiang also reported to the police station. The police station is now strictly investigating the source of the bandits' car.</p>

<p>Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing who used to work in the military and police and is suspected of abetting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, appealed to the High Court Branch after being sentenced to life imprisonment by the Second Special Court in the first instance. After repeated court investigations and trials, the court found no substantial evidence of a crime. On the 26th of last month, the court overturned the original judgment and declared him innocent. Later, Wang applied to suspend detention during the appeal period and was ordered to provide a 10,000-yuan guarantor to ensure his appearance when summoned. His family found six stores to jointly guarantee Wang's release. Subsequently, because the Police Affairs Office did not accept the High Court Branch's judgment on appeal and requested the prosecutor of the High Court Branch to appeal to the Supreme Court, the Criminal Tribunal of the High Court Branch, considering that the case was already in the appeal process due to the Police Affairs Office's appeal, considered Wang Xinggao's bail amount insufficient. Therefore, the court summoned Wang a few days ago and instructed him to increase the guarantee amount by 10,000 yuan, requiring a 20,000-yuan written guarantee. During the period for finding a guarantor, he was temporarily detained. Eventually, Wang's family managed to find a guarantor through various channels, and the guarantee procedures were completed on the day before yesterday. Wang Xinggao was then released for the second time and regained his freedom.</p>

<p>Wan Yuanli South Goods Store at 180-182 Manchuria Road, Zhabei, was about to close and settle accounts at 7:50 pm the day before yesterday (23rd) when six robbers suddenly arrived. Four of them rushed into the store (two wearing white poplin short shirts and pants, one wearing Indian silk shirts and pants, and another wearing a straw hat), each holding a handgun. The other two stood guard at the back door (their clothing and whether they had weapons were unclear). The robbers who rushed into the store opened the small silver box on the counter and seized all the legal tender and silver coins, totaling about 220 yuan. They immediately fled the store in different directions. Although the store manager, Mr. Li, immediately sent a clerk to report to the police at the Mongolian Road Police Station at the intersection of Manchuria Road and Kulun Road, the police were unable to pursue them due to the large number of robbers. They sounded the police siren, and police from nearby posts rushed to the scene, but the robbers had already fled far away and could not be caught.

<p>Cao Jingui, a 20-year-old from Nanhui, Pudong, a shop assistant at the Ren Da Leather Goods Store at 178 Broadway, had an argument and fight with his colleague Xue Jinbo over a gambling dispute around 9:00 pm on the 12th of this month. He stabbed Xue in the abdomen with a knife, causing his intestines to spill out. Xue fell to the ground and cried for help. Seeing the serious consequences, Cao fled towards the Oriental Wharf on Broadway. Yu Wenbing, a native of Nantong and a shop assistant at the neighboring Ren Chang Leather Goods Store, helped to chase him. Yu was also stabbed in the left arm, hand, chest, and wrist. As a result, colleagues Pu Changsheng and the Japanese police officer from No. 117, along with Chinese detective Zhang Desheng, captured Cao. The murder weapon, a knife, was thrown into the Huangpu River. The injured Xue and Yu were taken to the Jen Ji Hospital for treatment. The suspect Cao was sent to the First Special District Court, where he testified that Pu Changsheng was the actual assailant. The judge ordered him to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the injured Xue Jinbo had not recovered and could not appear in court to testify. However, Yu Wenbing and Pu Changsheng were present and requested to be questioned. Pu Changsheng claimed that he saw the defendant running away from the wharf, chased by Ma Anxiang, who was shouting for help. He stopped Cao and handed him over to the Japanese police officer from No. 117. He did not know why. The defendant's claim that he used a knife to stab the two victims was a false accusation. Yu Wenbing, whose injuries had slightly healed, testified that he knew the defendant. The defendant's resentment towards Xue Jinbo was not about mahjong, but because Xue had an affair with the defendant's sister, which he felt was a great loss of face, leading to his actions. He saw Cao stab Xue in the abdomen and flee towards the wharf. He stopped him, and Cao stabbed him several times in the hand and shoulder with a leather-cutting knife before escaping. His left wrist tendon was severed, and he feared that his hand would be disabled. The defendant insisted that the incident started with a mahjong game, with seven people on Xue Jinbo's side. Pu Changsheng dragged him out to beat him, and Pu accidentally stabbed Xue and Yu while trying to stab him with a knife. The testimony was inconsistent, and Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be detained and re-examined after Xue recovered from his injuries.</p>

The rickshaw puller then demanded five yuan from Dai as a dismissal fee. When Dai refused, he reported the rickshaw puller to the police, who detained him and released him. Nursing a grudge, the rickshaw puller plotted revenge. Around 9:00 am on the 13th of last month, the rickshaw puller lay in wait near Dai Hook Bridge. When Dai's rickshaw passed by, the rickshaw puller suddenly threw a can full of filth (human feces) at Dai, covering him from head to toe in a foul-smelling mess. The rickshaw puller fled the scene. His heart still not at ease, around 10:00 am on the 21st, he repeated the same act at the intersection of Sanyangjing Bridge and Jiangxi Road, throwing filth and escaping again.

<p>Cao Ding, the 38-year-old wife of Cao Guanyuan of Qingning Temple, Pudong, had given birth to nine children. Last November, her menstrual cycle suddenly stopped, and she became pregnant again. Starting on the 10th of this month, she had been bleeding continuously every day. In the past three days, the bleeding had increased, causing her to faint several times and lose color in her face. Although traditional midwives had repeatedly performed procedures, they were ineffective. On the morning of the 24th, Dr. Qu Duizhen, an obstetrics expert from Xinlu, Pudong, was invited for examination. After examination, Dr. Qu said it was a difficult labor, and immediately sent a telegram inviting her uncle, Dr. Qu Boheng (院长 of the Sheng Sheng Hospital on Route Saussier in the French Concession of Shanghai), to perform the procedure. Around 11:00 am, Dr. Qu led Zhu Shijing, Yao Weixin, Yu Heiying, Wu Biyi, Xu Xinbao, Jin Yajun, and other assistants to the Cao residence. At that time, the delivery room was packed with people, all weeping and crying. Dr. Qu remained calm and sterilized the area. After examination, he determined that it was the same as what Dr. Duizhen had said. He immediately began the operation. Dr. Qu inserted his hand deep into the uterus, almost up to his elbow. Soon after, he reversed the position of the fetus, changing its face position to a foot position. In a few minutes, the fetus and placenta were completely expelled. The crisis was over. Dr. Qu was extremely exhausted and sweating profusely. Onlookers praised him as a living Buddha. After the procedure, Dr. Qu told the crowd that it was a pity that they had adhered to old practices and delayed for so many days, causing the fetus to die in vain. If they had sought the help of a scientific midwife earlier, the child's life could have been saved. He sighed deeply.</p>
<h3 id="e174">National Products Movement Federation: Activities of Various Groups <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Inspection Group, the Women's Use of National Products Group, and the Student Summer Vacation Promotion of National Products Group of the Shanghai National Products Movement Federation have been actively preparing and have been established one after another. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Inspection Group: In order to promote the use of national products by people in various regions, the federation's committee meeting decided to establish a Yangtze River Inspection Group and invited Lin Kecong, Huang Shuipei, and Lu Lihua to be members. Unable to spare the time, they declined. The group is now looking for suitable talent. Once decided, they will depart for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Shandong, and other regions to conduct inspections. Women's Use Group: The federation believes that women are housewives and their words and deeds are enough to influence men. The sharp decline in imports over the years has proven that women's promotion can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, they initiated the Women's Use of National Products Group and invited female compatriots several times to discuss methods, which were all supported by the female community. The federation decided to establish the Women's Use Group at the same time as the Yangtze River Inspection Group departs.</p>
<p>Summer Vacation Promotion Group: Last month, the group invited principals and teachers from large and small schools in the city and decided to take advantage of the summer vacation period to have students promote the use of national products in all directions. At that time, the persons in charge of the schools believed that using national products was the duty of the people, and that students promoting them during the holidays would cultivate their ability to serve society. Therefore, they all expressed sympathy. According to a report from the Xin Sheng News Agency, more than 30 schools, including Nanli and Huadong, have been formally established.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Wang Fengzhen vs. Shen Jinzhi: New Evidence on Age May Exist; Defendant Ordered to Appear in Court in 8,000 Yuan Compensation Case <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jinzhi, also known as Shen Keren, the young owner of the Shen Wanxing Wick and Cattail Mat Store at No. 30-32, Yongyou Lane, Damatou Inside Ma Road, South City, relied on his family wealth and his fair complexion to indulge in pleasure in brothels. He became intimate with Wang Fengzhen, a prostitute from the Yunlou brothel between Guangxi Road and Shantou Road. They extinguished the candles and made a pact to stay together, and took a photo together at Tiger Hill. The two had already agreed to be husband and wife, but his family strongly opposed it and had already arranged a marriage for him with Xia Hefang, a wealthy woman. Therefore, Shen and Fengzhen had once signed an agreement to separate. In the winter of last year, the two rekindled their love. The two then voluntarily entered into a contract, stating that if the man abandoned the woman, he would have to compensate her 8,000 yuan; if the woman abandoned the man, she would have to compensate him 5,000 yuan. However, on April 19 of this year, Shen Jinzhi finally followed his parents' wishes and married Xia Hefang at the Lake Club. From then on, the lovers went their separate ways. Wang Fengzhen then took the agreement to the local court to request a judgment ordering him to fulfill the 8,000 yuan compensation as agreed. Both parties were listed as 22 years old on the complaint. Shen Jinzhi argued that he was only 21 years old and had not yet had his birthday when the agreement was signed. He was under 20 years old and did not have the capacity to act under the law and was not liable for the contract. The dispute over age has continued until now and has not been resolved. The court ordered both parties to provide evidence in their favor. At yesterday's hearing, the defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, stated that the plaintiff had now discovered new evidence that could prove that the defendant was 22 years old this year, but needed a 10-day extension to present it. The official immediately approved and ordered the defendant's lawyer to order the defendant to appear in court in person for questioning next time.</p>

<p>Dr. He Gongdu, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine (clinic at No. 1, Wufeng Lane, Xiafei Road), has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for more than ten years. He has profound knowledge and rich experience, and has long been renowned in Shanghai. His reputation in the medical community is well-deserved. The mother of Mr. Gu Zhi'an, a reporter for the Shanghai Times, suffered from spring fever this spring. She was bedridden for more than a month, and her condition reached a dangerous peak. Other doctors were helpless. Because she knew that Dr. Bao had repeatedly cured serious illnesses, she urgently telegraphed for an invitation, day and night. After Dr. He took her pulse, he also believed that the yin and yang were separated and would be resolved soon. If not for a large dose of yang-restoring and nutrient-nourishing medication, there would be little hope. That night, he prescribed a aconite nourishing decoction for her to try. It had a great turning point. He then imitated the method of rejuvenating deer antler slices and administered ginseng blood slices, etc. In this way, he added and subtracted ingredients over several days, and then changed to a stomach-harmonizing and nutrient-nourishing formula. After more than two months of treatment, she gradually recovered. Now she has an increasing appetite and can move around as usual. Everyone who hears about it is amazed and full of praise. The Zhang family is especially grateful.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I recently read in the news column of the Shen Bao on the 21st of this month a report that lawyer Chen Zemin was accused of privately selling the property of his client to pay off public fees. It stated that Zhu Zhang deposited the deed with lawyer Chen Zemin, but unexpectedly, the field property was sold to the local headman Zuo Yaoqing twenty-four years ago. Now, the three sisters, Zhang Zhu Fuying, etc., claiming that they have three-fifths of the co-ownership of the field property, have filed a lawsuit with the local court against their mother Zhu Zhang, lawyer Chen Zemin, and local headman Zuo Yaoqing for privately selling other people's real estate. This is not in accordance with the facts. The sale of the above-mentioned property was directly made by Zhu Zhang to Zuo Yaoqing. Zhu Zhang and Yaoqing requested the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau to survey and map the land. There is an original case in the Land Bureau that can prove this. The original graves on the land were personally moved elsewhere by Zhu Zhang. Lawyer Chen had no knowledge of it. However, when Zuo Yaoqing made the payment, because he did not trust Zhu Zhang, he only entrusted lawyer Chen to issue a receipt on his behalf, as proof only. The various points reported by your newspaper are mostly untrue. Our lawyers are entrusted by lawyer Chen to handle the litigation of this case. We hereby send the details in a letter, hoping that you will make corrections to avoid confusion. Sincerely, Lawyers Zhao Futing and Wu Zhaozhen, July 24th.</p>

Before taking this extraordinary measure, the chairman of the committee had repeatedly warned Mrs. Holm, but Mrs. Holm said that brandy was a necessity for her daily diet, and also said that she would definitely win the championship this time. The chairman of the management committee also tried his best to tolerate it, but when the ship arrived in Hamburg, Mrs. Holm showed a great drunkenness in the bar, so the chairman of the committee could not bear it any longer, so they declared that she must take the nearest ship back to Hamburg, and took back the American World Games uniform.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Overview of Scientific Research by Faculty Members of National Universities: 502 Research Projects Completed <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>In order to encourage and promote scientific research by faculty members of national universities, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to all specialized schools and above nationwide since the 23rd academic year, hoping that faculty members of each school will pay attention to experimentation based on their teaching and research experience. If there are creations and inventions, rewards will be given accordingly. The Ministry of Education is now investigating the actual situation of scientific research by faculty members of all specialized schools nationwide. According to reports up to the 23rd academic year, national, provincial, private specialized schools, colleges, universities, and public specialized schools nationwide are conducting research by subject. Taking the study of a certain thing as a special topic, for example, a professor at Tsinghua University studying optics is inventing a telephoto lens that makes the image clear. If this optical research is taken as a special topic for near photography, according to this statistics, the number of research topics by faculty members of specialized schools and above nationwide is as follows: In terms of practical subjects, 91 topics in science, 41 in agriculture and forestry, 6 in engineering, and 236 in medicine (mostly at Peking Union Medical College Hospital) have been completed. 114 topics in science, 76 in agriculture and forestry, 17 in engineering, and 22 in medicine are still under research and have not been completed. In terms of the above-mentioned practical subjects, a total of 374 topics have been completed and 229 topics have not been completed. In terms of humanities subjects, 64 topics in literature and art (a professor studied dialects in various parts of the country and has a special work on this, and obtained a doctorate degree abroad), 29 in law and politics, 28 in education, and 7 in commerce have been completed. 98 topics in literature and art, 41 in law and politics, 28 in education, and 9 in commerce are still under research and have not been completed. In terms of the above-mentioned humanities subjects, a total of 128 topics have been completed and 176 topics have not been completed. In total, 502 topics have been completed and 405 topics are still under research. Although the Ministry of Education promoted and rewarded research by faculty members of universities in the 20th academic year, some professors at various schools had already started studying certain sciences in 1915, but the research has not yet been successful. Therefore, many of the 405 topics that are still under research in the 23rd year survey report are similar to this. In the future, the Ministry of Education plans to compile an index of the detailed topics researched by each school as a reference for the national academic community. The success of this type of research topic is of great value to the academic community.</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang News) Zeng Jikuan, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Improvement Management Committee, and Chen Zhi, a technician, along with Li Yingong, Zhang Fuyan, Yao Chuanfa, Pi Zuoqiong, An Han, Yu Kuang, Ling Daoyang, Tu Rong, Zhu Huifang, Liang Xi, Shao Jun, and other leading figures in the forestry industry in Beijing, recently heard that after Dean Wu Fuzhen of the College of Agriculture of Zhejiang University took office, he immediately abolished the Forestry Department. However, the forestry department of the university has been operating for twenty-four years. How can such a long-standing institution be abolished rashly based on the proposals of one or two people from the university or college? If this happens, forestry institutions will be in constant jeopardy. Therefore, Zeng and others were extremely shocked upon hearing the news. In addition to submitting a request to President Jiang and the Ministry of Education, led by the Chinese Forestry Society, requesting that the university authorities handle the matter with caution, they also sent a friendly letter to Dean Wu, hoping that he would consider the matter in order to salvage the situation.</p>

<p>(6) Significant Increase in Books and Equipment</p>
<p>Since the last term, the university has paid exceptional attention to book equipment. This year's book budget is 80,000 yuan, and the expansion of the equipment of the College of Science is also 80,000 yuan. Large quantities of books arrive at the library every week. A considerable number of books that have been ordered are still en route.</p>
<p>(7) Emphasis on Physical Education</p>
<p>Because the students of Sichuan Province are known to be physically weak, the university pays special attention to physical education. A physical education guidance committee and a physical education department are established to be responsible for designing and promoting physical education throughout the university. This year, the university held various sports competitions twice, a spring sports meet once, and organized representative teams to participate in competitions outside the university, with good results. In terms of equipment, in addition to the construction of two 400-meter running tracks, two straight tracks of more than 200 meters, two soccer fields, eight basketball courts, twelve tennis courts, and five volleyball courts, all kinds of sports equipment are available. It is said that Mr. Huang Zhongfu, who was famous for sports in Tsinghua University and is now studying physical education in the United States, has been hired to serve as the director of physical education next year, and the facilities for physical education will definitely make greater progress.</p>
<p>(8) Organization of the Southwest Social Science Research Center</p>
<p>Because Sichuan is located in the western frontier and the social situation has many unique aspects that need to be investigated in order to discover facts and provide reference for social scientists, the university specially organized the Southwest Social Science Research Center this term. It conducts thorough investigations and research on economic and folk customs issues in Sichuan Province and the southwestern border. The center has an advisory committee. In addition to the deans and secretary-general of the university's colleges as ex-officio members, it also hires Chen Tongfu, an internationally renowned labor issue expert and current professor at National Tsinghua University, Zhou Gengsheng, an international law expert and current professor at Wuhan University, Hu Xiansu, a biologist expert and current director of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, and Tao Menghe, a sociologist expert and director of the Social Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, as committee members. He Lian, a famous economist and dean of the School of Business and director of the Economic Research Institute of Nankai University, serves as the chairman of the advisory committee. Bao Juemin, Ye Qianji, Zhang Xiyang, and Gu Yuantian, members of the Sichuan Economic Survey Team of Nankai University, are researchers and are actively carrying out investigations. They went to Guanxian and Pixian counties last month for investigation and are said to be going to Pengxian and Tangqing counties soon.</p>
<p>(9) Establishment of the Public Legal Advisory Office</p>
<p>Because the College of Law lacks practical experimental materials, there are shortcomings in understanding social governance methods. This term, the College of Law specially established a Public Legal Advisory Office to answer the public's legal questions, so that students can have practical experience, and legal knowledge can also be popularized to the general public. Since its establishment, it has been highly praised by people from all walks of life, and letters requesting guidance or advice have been received in an endless stream. This is one aspect of the university's service to society.</p>
<p>(10) Extracurricular Activities</p>
<p>The university strongly promotes extracurricular activities for students. For example, the research societies of various departments of the university have been established this year, and each has achieved considerable results. The university also hires several music instructors and one drama instructor to guide students in researching music and drama. Therefore, the university's Music Research Society and Drama Research Society have performed several times this year and have won high praise from people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>In general, the university is located in Chengdu, which is rich in products, and the cost of living is lower than that of the Yangtze River and coastal areas. Each student can spend 110 to 120 yuan per term. If they are a little frugal, they can spend 100 yuan per term. If the university can continue to develop and keep pace with other universities in the country, it will undoubtedly be a paradise for students in the southwest to study.</p>

In the afternoon, the bidding yarn suddenly flew up, and the white goods of each stall also changed greatly. The market gradually rose. Customers bravely absorbed them, but because the amount of pieces stored in each factory in August was limited, it became even more profitable.

The Gang gang's private goods were slightly reduced, and the purchase gradually became active. The purchase of yuan twill blue cloth, direct tribute, serge, fine cloth, and fine twill was more frequent. However, the route to Tianjin and Beijing has plummeted due to the flooding of private goods.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market was quiet and sluggish, with only sporadic transactions. The number of brokers from nearby markets attending tea gatherings decreased. Prices remained similar to the day before. White plain broadcloth continued to be slow-moving. Tianxiang broadcloth sold for one yuan, three jiao, seven fen, and a half. Lihe white plain woolen fabric was at five yuan, three jiao, Yide at five yuan, one jiao, Yiji at three yuan, eight jiao, and Fengyu Baishuifang white serge sold for five yuan, seven jiao, and a half. Yiji Daoxiancao was at four yuan, seven jiao, and a half. Japanese-made Sima Xiangru was at three yuan, seven jiao, and the second-grade Jiangbian at three yuan, three jiao. Paris floral and plain fabrics, however, showed a continued positive trend.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Grains: Price Limits Restrict, Futures Powder Market Becomes Stagnant, Imported Wheat Prices Rise Frequently <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed generally stable prices across various months. Imported wheat quotations showed Chicago up one, two, or three jiao, and Canada up four or five jiao. Market sentiment, constrained by price limits on the current month, resulted in a stagnant situation. Current total quantities were reportedly not large, but positions could not be left uncovered, so the price reached the limit, unable to fall further. For forward months, there was slight business from merchant guilds, and sentiment was quite positive, with August and September up one fen compared to the previous day, and other months up one and a half fen. By the afternoon opening, the current month remained unchanged, while forward months saw some profit-taking due to client cessation, falling back nearly a fen compared to the morning. However, compared to the previous day's close, they were still up two and a half to seven and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Imported Wheat Continues to Rise, Wheat Futures Market Appears Quite Firm, Market Prices Gradually Approach Imported Wheat Prices <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, saw prices trending steadily upward for all months. Imported wheat quotations rose again by one, two, three, four, or five jiao. Sentiment among industry insiders and outsiders inevitably anticipated further gains. As the settlement date for the current month approached, merchants mostly withdrew their holdings and rolled them into forward months, causing tightness in the current month, rising as high as six jiao. Forward month transactions were also clear, only at two or three fen. By the afternoon opening, the current month trended slightly flat, falling back by two fen, but forward months saw a bullish atmosphere and gradual price increases due to large outside firms taking positions. September and October rose six or seven fen compared to the previous day, while others rose two, three, or four fen. Given the current situation, if prices rise further, they will approach parity with imported wheat, which would be a dangerous situation. The spot wheat market remained stable, similar to yesterday, with Kaiming Guangshahe wheat at four yuan, five jiao, seven fen, Bengbu wheat at four yuan, five jiao, six fen, Suqian wheat at four yuan, five jiao, three fen, Huaian wheat at four yuan, five jiao, Daqiao wheat at four yuan, four jiao, seven fen, Jiangbei wheat at four yuan, four jiao, and a half, Anqing wheat at four yuan, three jiao, nine fen, second grade two jiao, six fen, Hankou wheat at four yuan, three jiao, seven fen, Shaobo wheat at four yuan, three jiao, two or three fen, and Wuhu wheat at four yuan, two jiao, two fen, with Fuxin handling 4,000 bags and Shenda handling 2,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Hsien market condition was that because early rice from various places will soon be on the market, and reports state that Wuhu has already been harvested, with prices only around six yuan, five jiao, ample rice reserves in various places are depreciating in price and seeking sales. In Shanghai, stockpiles of Du Geng, imported Ke Hsien are particularly large. It is said that there are still 200,000 bags of He Xia Geng rice accumulated from last year, so sentiment is even softer. Merchants and hoarders are all trying to sell at any price. Although sales by various local merchant guilds are still good, market prices have fallen by nearly one jiao to one jiao and a half. The total daily output of 5,000 bags of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Taizhou rice was divided among Ningbo, Shantou, local streets, and inland areas.</p>
<h3 id="e238">White Geng and Du Jian Fall Further by One Jiao <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total supply from various merchant guilds was over twenty companies, with a total of more than 4,000 shi of goods, mostly thick early Geng rice. However, sales on the local street market remained weak. The Dalian and Weihai guilds only handled a thin amount of thin rice, about 200 bags. Therefore, the market situation was even more sluggish. The market prices for thick early Geng rice and thin rice all fell by one jiao or more. Du Yang Jian rice also depreciated by a few fen. The Yin Bian Yuan brand was still able to maintain its price. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were seventeen or eighteen ships from He Xia and other places. The market removed goods from various guilds. High-quality white Geng rice was stagnant, while medium and lower grades saw slight sales. High-priced goods fell by one jiao, while medium and lower grades were sluggish by a few fen. Thin rice was scarce, and prices remained firm. Yang Jian rice was stagnant, with high-priced goods falling by five or six fen. Medium and lower grades were cut by more than one jiao. Du Bu Jian rice fell by nearly one jiao. Ke Hsien rice was short by more than one jiao. Yin Bian Yuan remained stable, and prices for all other goods were soft.</p>

<p>Recently, the soybean cake sales market saw a sudden surge in orders from the Shantou merchant guild. Yesterday, market prices rose by two fen in the morning and afternoon. Citywide transactions showed 1,100 pieces of various factory Four Brand cakes, with orders for 20,000 pieces to be delivered the day after tomorrow, 7,500 pieces for delivery at the end of the month, and 17,000 pieces for delivery in the first half of August. Other local factory black cakes saw transactions of 500 pieces, and Lun Shahe Guangbian cakes saw 2,000 pieces. The overall situation was still firm. New yellow soybeans continued to see a higher-for-lower grading situation. Oil factories continued to place orders, and various merchant guilds tirelessly removed goods, leading to good sentiment. Orders included over 1,000 bags of Chengmen beans, 300-400 bags of Sanyang beans, 20 bags of Jiangqiao beans, 100 bags of Hankou June white beans, and 300 bags of Shaoxing and Quzhou new beans. Factories purchased four carloads of Kaiyuan old beans. The local street Ningbo and other areas purchased 200 bags of Sipingjie large-grain beans and over 600 bags of Sha Huang and Du beans.</p>

<p>The gold market yesterday saw pure gold fall, and sentiment became even more exhausted. The decline continued. There was a slight rebound midway, but unfortunately, buying interest was only temporary. The result was another decline of two jiao. Initial morning indications showed that overseas silver markets in England and America were flat, and the forward price of Montrie silver was also unchanged. Exchange rates were lower. London raw gold fell by one and a half pence. Central Bank official rates showed England and America flat, and the Customs Gold Unit fell by two li. The standard gold price was announced, lowered to 1,128 yuan. Outside-market preliminary trading opened at 31 yuan to 1 yuan and a half. Xianghe, Tongyu, Run, Qian, and Changxiang sold off, falling to a price of one yuan. Large firms took advantage of the low price to maintain and stabilize the market. The morning opening was low, but large firms slightly covered positions after opening, gradually flattening out the market. HSBC official rates showed England and America flat, with slight fluctuations. After entering the market, short sellers entered. Although the silver equalization tax announcement was flat, there was a slight rebound, but soon, more selling pressure emerged, and the market gradually fell again. The overall trend was very mediocre. The noon trend was also peaceful, with a very stagnant outlook. Here is a record of the market conditions for the first half of the day:</p>

The registration price for this month was 1,125 yuan, August was 1,129 yuan, and September was 1,132 yuan. Morning makeup water was 1,125 yuan, and the red gold price was increased by eight yuan, to 1,139 yuan, one jiao. The spot market was peaceful.

Red gold mountain spring water was sold to the silver shop guild for 110 taels, increased by thirteen yuan. Swaps were quiet.</p>
<p>Trading within the exchange was scarce. Summarized, Qiafengyong, Futai water, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yongfeng, Qingfa Yong, etc. were on the buy-side, while Hengchang, Dafa Yongshengyuan, Yongqian, Changxiang, Xianghe, Tongtai, Changdingkang, etc. were on the sell-side.

<p>The exchange market yesterday saw a slight decrease in exchange rates, resulting in sterling weakness and dollar tightness. Initial morning reports from overseas indicated that London long and short term large bars were flat, the New York silver market was unchanged, and the Montrie forward silver price was also the same. London raw gold fell by one and a half pence. Sterling against the dollar fell by half a cent, sterling against the franc rose by six pounds, the dollar against sterling fell by slightly less than half a cent, and the dollar against the franc fell by six, eight, seven, five.

The exchange market morning opening recent selling price was sterling one shilling, two pence, three seven five, and four three seven five paired, the dollar thirty yuan, one two five, compared with the previous close, showing sterling weaker and the dollar tighter, because exchange rates decreased. After opening, Citibank sold, but banks still accepted. HSBC official rates showed England and America flat and fluctuated. The silver equalization tax announcement was unchanged. After this, banks mutually traded, and although British banks sold shillings and China banks sold dollars, the overall trend remained mostly hovering. The noon situation was still loose. The later market saw banks trading, so exchange rates were relatively firm, but the process was still mediocre. At the close, the recent selling price was sterling one shilling, two pence, three seven five, and four three seven five paired, the dollar thirty yuan, one two five, compared with the previous close, showing sterling slightly weaker and the dollar slightly tighter.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a very good market condition. Although market prices were high, buyers did not mind the expensiveness. Short sellers covered positions and fell into the trap again. Although there were still signs of successive failures, they were repeatedly defeated. Class A shares even reached a new high of 71 yuan. The resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi issue was a major reason, and long traders took advantage of the opportunity to squeeze shorts, resulting in abnormal development. The current situation does not seem to be stopping. Today is the last day of the month, and market price movements may still have unexpected shapes. Yesterday's course was initially firm and then weak, seeming to have a reversal, but after entering the market, long traders pushed the price up, and it rose again. Class A shares rose another three jiao and a half, and the highest price has already emerged. The second-round situation suddenly changed, and buying interest was even stronger. Although No. 4 continued to sell, it still rose strongly. The highest price for Class A shares reached 71 yuan, and market prices all improved by three or four jiao. The market price result was that forward Class E shares and recent Class D shares were slightly down by one or two jiao, while the rest all rose again by one or two jiao. Only Class A shares rose by five jiao and a half to seven jiao, and 96 alone fell by five fen to one jiao. The total volume traded was 9,016,000 yuan. Here is a table comparing the results of the increases and decreases: (Unit: Yuan, Trading Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the holding prices of Sino-Japanese silk products in New York declined across the board by two fen due to the increasingly stagnant market. White factory 78 degrees, 20-22 filament standard silk, spot sale opened at $1.67, down four fen from the previous day. Futures were at $1.57, down two fen. The Lyon silk market was as stable as ever. Yokohama was less prosperous, with spot and futures products falling by ten to fourteen yuan each. The Shanghai foreign trader silk market became increasingly depressed as a result. The difference between domestic and foreign silk prices was about 60 yuan, making it difficult to approach each other. Yesterday, foreign firms only had hand-reeled silk sales open, and prices were very attractive. User silk market, both white factory and Shandong yellow warp, saw sporadic sales open.</p>
<p>A large artificial silk firm in this city, yesterday, again imported Italian Selotron 100 count, bright three line number, 190 boxes, 120 count bright three line number, 200 boxes. Once the 100 count was opened, it was entirely purchased by the Shengze merchant guild, priced at 125 yuan. The 120 count was also distributed by the Mupu and other peers and silk mills, priced at 104 yuan. Japanese goods transactions included a local firm that ordered 20 boxes of 120 count Sky Bridge brand for August delivery, priced at 135 yuan, tax paid by customer. 25 boxes of 120 count Gold Ring Star brand, priced at 134 yuan, tax paid by customer. The market is quite short of Japanese spot goods, and 120 count Sky Bridge is priced at 435 yuan, with few transactions. No stock of Tian Tan and Sun brands. Yesterday, various real sales outlets had lighter orders, because today customs will again open bids for 170 plus boxes of confiscated private goods, 120 count No. 2 Sini exchanged warehouse receipt opened at 125 yuan, silk mills purchased more than 40 boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e244">High-grade Zhuang Zhenmei Still in Strong Demand <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much progress in the green tea market. A total of 3,000 boxes of green tea arrived from various places. Among them, Tunxi high-grade Zhuang tea at 90 yuan, domestic and foreign goods, were still in strong demand based on overseas telegrams, and the market was quite firm. Zhenmei from Sui'an, Shexian, Kaihua, Yushan, and other routes remained sluggish, and sentiment became increasingly soft, and it was feared that the market would be difficult to stabilize. Ping Shui pearl tea was also slightly quieter than before. Only Zu Zhenmei, Xiumei, and other items had relatively active sales citywide.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Merchants Association report, Zhenmei transactions from various routes were sporadic yesterday, and selling prices gradually declined. Jinjiang and Dui Tunzhen continued to handle 200 boxes, priced at 75 to 78 yuan. Huizhen Tongfu handled over 100 pieces, priced at 78 to 79 yuan. Tianyu and Jinlong also purchased a small number. Tuhzhuang purchased Zhen Yihe and Xiehe each had 100 piece transactions, priced at 80 to 90 yuan. And Yihe of Suian also handled 30 pieces, priced at around 100 yuan. It is difficult to develop the market image. Jinlong and Hua Cha of Ping Shui large companies each have one or two to handle purchases. It is estimated that Shuyu, Tianxiang and Jiezhu have all been traded, and the wholesale price is slightly lower than before. Another variety of Zhu Jinlong, Yihe, and foreign buyers each ordered over 1000 boxes, the price from 57 to 60 yuan, sales are still endless.</p>

<p>Walnuts: Sales have recently turned around, and the market situation has gradually improved. According to a letter from Tianjin, due to predictions of a poor new walnut harvest, production prices are firm. In particular, lower grades are the target of concentrated purchases by buyers, so they have risen by one or two yuan compared to before. The remaining top grades and walnut meat are still stable. The Shanghai market prices are as follows: hand-picked north-grade walnuts sell for 20 yuan, Shimen walnuts for 17-18 yuan, south walnuts for 14-15 yuan, and Xiaojin walnuts for 13.5 yuan (cold storage). Guanshui walnut meat is 40 yuan, tiger-skin walnut meat is 36 yuan, and lower grades are 26 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e246">One-Sided View of Chastity <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Wen</p>
<p>What is chastity? Chastity is the standard of human behavior. A woman who can meet this standard, without harming others but benefiting herself, is moral. But how can the establishment of morality be realized in an era of male dominance? In the past—and actually now as well—women were appendages of men. If a wife died, or even if she was not enough to satisfy her husband's desires, the husband could take concubines and frequent prostitutes again and again. If a woman's husband died and she could not satisfy her desires, she could only reluctantly suppress them, otherwise it would be difficult to gain public sympathy. This completely oppresses women from the standpoint of male power expansion. Our country has what is called the "seven grounds for divorce," which established the chastity of women and exclusively their bodies. This concept still exists today!</p>
<p>Now, although there are many people who advocate that chastity must be mutually maintained, what are the results it creates? On the surface, it seems to have shattered the illusion of male power expansion and excited people's modern thinking. But in reality, this anticipated hope, no matter how many times it is mentioned, cannot be universally realized! This is clear because the economic status and decline in productive capacity of women inevitably leads to this result.</p>
<p>In Chinese society, where female occupations are extremely difficult, the lives of women often depend on men. Therefore, women cannot help but cater to the needs of men and strive to maintain their chastity. Therefore, the dependence of women is the power that consolidates male power. We clearly know that the sanctions of male power undoubtedly deprive women of their autonomy!</p>
<p>No. 27 If women want to completely break this one-sided concept of chastity, they must exert their perseverance and strive toward their future to seek economic liberation. Otherwise, the results you hope for will only be scolding and ridicule, and you will not receive any sympathy or assistance!</p>
<h3 id="e247">Housewife Life During the Summer Vacation <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Yun</p>
<p>The family can be said to be a special period during the summer vacation. Housewives in the family should have considerable research on issues such as family hygiene, children's management, and entertainment.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, the temperature is always very high, and the bacteria of various summer diseases have a good opportunity to survive and reproduce. During this period, if you are not careful with your diet and daily life, the health of the whole family can be completely destroyed. In the past, I listened to a lecture by a certain lady. She said, "Half of my time in the family is almost entirely spent on the diet in the family. I do everything myself, from washing all the vegetables to cooking them. So relatives are all secretly discussing me, saying that I have a hard life, and I hire maids, and I still have to do these things myself. I don't know that I have my quirks, and I am always extremely worried about the laziness of the maids, especially in terms of food. So in the summer vacation, even if it is to heat a dish or boil a pot of water, I must do it myself. Although I am so tireless, I have not seen any amazing results, but in ten years, the whole family has not suffered from an infectious disease once. Even in the summer vacation when epidemics are prevalent, my family is not affected at all. This cannot but be said to be the reward for my attention to dietary hygiene." Although what she said seems very ordinary, I think this is really a good rule for women during the summer vacation, so I specially introduce it. In addition, such as the proper regulation of diet, the night should not be too greedy for coolness, the family appliances should be washed and disinfected diligently, and harmful insects such as mosquitoes and flies should be killed and eliminated. All these tasks should naturally be borne by the housewives.</p>
<p>Children should be managed in a regular and rational manner during this summer vacation, otherwise they will wander and become wild children. I remember that a certain lady also introduced this issue. She said, "During the children's summer vacation, I think it is the best training period for the children's intellectual, moral and physical education. Therefore, during the summer vacation, I always urge them to get out of bed at about 5 o'clock every morning. At about 7 o'clock, I drive them to play in the lawn next to the house or in the park, and let them exercise as much as possible. From 9 o'clock, I order them to read, write, read newspapers and write essays. At 12 o'clock, have lunch, and in the afternoon, let them take a walk or play games, and at about 2 o'clock, make them take a nap. Wake them up in time and assign them work, such as wiping windows, washing floors, or rolling grass, etc., for one hour. Then give them a bath and rest. After dinner, take them to concerts, or watch movies, or go out for a walk, or go to the park to cool off. In every seven or eight weeks of summer vacation, it is like this. So my children not only do not neglect their studies during the summer vacation, but can make progress, and their health status when school starts is always better than when they are on vacation." It is naturally best to manage women strictly like a certain lady. If you can't learn it completely, then learning a few points is always better than not managing it at all. In short, although women do not have to go to school every day during the summer vacation, it is definitely not for letting children lead a wandering life. As a mother, you should clearly recognize this.</p>
<p>The issue of entertainment during the summer vacation is also very important. Entertainment is different depending on the family's living environment. So here, I can't introduce it specifically. But one thing is worth mentioning, that is, "Don't forget hygiene in entertainment." If entertainment is harmful to hygiene, it must be absolutely rejected. The best entertainment methods are going to the beach in Shanghai to bathe in the sea, or going to the suburbs for a hike, or inviting a few friends to read and laugh, or discuss family issues, or open a cold drink party, etc. These are all good summer entertainment methods.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Women in India <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Tian</p>
<p>If you are an intellectual, then you must say that "early marriage" is an undesirable and evil system concerning the development of the body, as well as physical and physiological damage. Indian marriage is immersed in this environment. Usually, every Indian woman has to marry before menstruation, because of religious superstition. Menstruation is considered the most unclean thing in the eyes of Indians. Once a woman has menstruation, it is the beginning of her life as a woman. As for the origin of their early marriage, there are two legends: First, it is said that there are words in the ancient Indian scriptures that praise early marriage. Therefore, everyone enthusiastically supports early marriage. Another legend says that half a century ago, the Hui people invaded India, and Hindu believers sent their virgin daughters under the protection of men, and the evil habit of early marriage was inherited as a result.</p>
<p>Although, a few years ago, an Indian named "Saka" proposed to amend the early marriage case, the law was established, but there is still no solution for the general public. As a wife of an Indian man, everyone has the obligation to give birth to a son. If there is no son after three years of marriage, then they are in danger of being divorced. Based on this weakness, in the suburbs of India's largest metropolis, "Calcutta," there is a "Kali Temple." It is said that there is a Bodhisattva who grants children in the temple. Many women who are eager to have children stay in the temple, hoping to obtain a son of God in their dreams. In the middle of the night, the so-called "Bodhisattva" appears and grants them the "son of God." As a result, women who have lost their chastity are everywhere in India. This is entirely the sin of the monks! What is even more ridiculous is that this "son of God" is even more loved in the eyes of his parents?</p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant and approaching her due date, she is driven into a small house, cut off from contact with outsiders, except for the midwife who serves her. No one sweeps or cleans the house, and over time, it becomes extremely dirty. If the woman gives birth to a boy, she can move out of this shack earlier. If she unfortunately gives birth to a girl, then she has to live in this sea of suffering for a long time before she can escape. Some women encounter difficult labor, and the incompetent midwives, who do not understand the principles, even use things like tiles or broken glass to perform surgery. Many pregnant women's lives are lost at the hands of these hateful midwives, and infant mortality is also high. Some pregnant women even live in cowsheds filled with the stench of cow dung.</p>
<p>"Widow immolation" was a barbaric custom in India in the past. This ritual involved the widow covering herself with oil after her husband's death and jumping into the fiery pit during his cremation. This inhuman practice has now been banned by the government. However, the lives of widows are like death. They can only wear a plain white cloth, cannot wear rings or other jewelry, and only have one meal a day. The most tiring and lowly work is entirely undertaken by them. In their sad lives, there is no possibility of seeing them smile again.</p>
<p>As for their daily life, they do not see other men besides their husbands. They spend their days like cattle and horses, and must cover their heads with white cloth when going out. When traveling by car, they also have to put cloth on all sides to prevent being seen by outsiders.</p>
<p>The life of Indian women is no different from being in hell.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Ms. Lu Shapai Talks About Japanese Women <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>A virtuous wife and good mother is their traditional concept. Women's rights are low, only wanting to marry a good husband. Women who have accepted new ideas have a tendency to self-awareness.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese students studying in Japan, there are two female writers who have recently made a name for themselves in the literary world. One is Wu Manzhi, and the other is Lu Shapai. Their works are often seen in several domestic magazines, and this publication has also published them many times. Readers should be able to remember them if they are not forgetful. I have never met Ms. Wu, but Ms. Lu is currently living in Shanghai. The other day, I was introduced by a friend and had a long conversation with her for an hour. I felt that her thinking was very advanced, her knowledge was very superior, and she had a special interest in women's and children's issues. We talked too much that day, so here are just three points excerpted: (1) A review of Japanese women; (2) The characteristics of Soviet women; (3) The future of Chinese women. Ms. Lu said, "How dare a person with such shallow experience as I am make irresponsible remarks on such a big issue and make a fool of myself!" I said, "You don't have to be so polite. New women should be bold in their words and deeds, that is the spirit of a heroine."</p>
<p>Japanese women, on the surface, almost all seem to have virtue and womanly ways. They are the epitome of a virtuous wife and good mother, and the vanguard of diligence and endurance. However, in reality, they have no status in society at all. It is simply impossible to talk about equal rights between men and women. Japan is truly a male-centered society, which is the opposite of the situation in Europe and the United States. This is a traditional idea that has not been able to be changed to this day. But looking at Japan's education system, men and women are completely different. Strictly speaking, the education of Japanese women is a slave education! In modern countries, men and women mostly receive equal education, and co-education is very common. However, Japan has never had this example. Elementary schools may be co-educational, but there are very few middle schools and above that are. Although a few universities allow a small number of female students to enroll, they can only audit and cannot be considered official students. All female schools above the secondary level focus entirely on domestic studies, such as sewing, cooking, nursing, hygiene, etc. In addition, they teach how to treat husbands and raise children. Even the education department of women's universities focuses on home economics and children's education. There are also bride schools, that is, bride schools, which train women in etiquette for dealing with people and methods for serving parents-in-law. Although the education of Japanese women is universal, how can slave-style education improve the status of women? Japanese women have very developed professions, but there is simply not one who holds a real position of power. Most women want to marry a rich and powerful man and live a comfortable life. They are satisfied with this, so it is no wonder that Westerners say that the most backward women in the world are Japanese. This cannot be said to be an exaggeration. In the minds of men, they think that the characteristics of Japanese women lie in their gentle, docile, polite, and capable of managing the home. But on the other hand, Japanese women are narrow-minded, lack manliness, only follow their husbands, and lack an independent and equal spirit, which may be their common weakness.</p>
<p>I have to say, Japanese women can manage their households, raise their children themselves after giving birth, not rely on others, pay attention to children's education, and cultivate new life for the country's future. This is indeed much stronger than women in our country. There are also a few Japanese women who have accepted new ideas from Europe and the United States, and are also opposing various measures in reality, but the government monitors them very strictly and does not allow you to spread new seeds. There are also women who have gone bankrupt in rural areas and have squeezed into cities to demand a living, and have a very conscious spirit. Japan has repeatedly increased its troops to the Northeast and North China, forcing strong men to go to the front line. Women who have suffered pain see their wives and children separated, and they are in a situation where they do not know whether they are alive or dead. They are also very uncomfortable in their hearts, and often take actions to resist. Under this high pressure, there is no way to do it.</p>
<p>Ms. Lu deeply admires Soviet women and is constantly studying all their issues. She said that the Soviet Union is truly an emerging country, and all theories have become reality. The only country in the world where men and women are truly equal is the Soviet Union. They participate together and are active everywhere in all kinds of careers, even in heavy industry, the army, navy, and air force. In some places, the power of women exceeds that of men. This great, hardworking, and independent spirit is truly worthy of admiration. I hope that Chinese women will also imitate them. Everyone has patriotic thoughts and a passion to save the country. What are we afraid of?</p>
<p>She expressed the following opinions on the future of Chinese women: "China is a semi-colonial country. Before it can rise to an independent and equal position, it is difficult to solve any problems. As for the current situation, I think that Chinese women should stand under the banner of unity and work together for the national revival movement to seek a way out for the whole country. This is by no means something that a few people can do alone. We women should have rich knowledge and a superior position, but only solve the lives of one person, and have little relationship with the masses. If you look down, you will know that there are as many people waiting to be liberated as there are sands in the Ganges River. In terms of women themselves, they must be self-aware, work hard, and recognize that I am a member of society, and must not regard marriage as my profession. Men and women are equal, and each has a common responsibility. Why should I rely on men? The general women in today's society, elementary school students want to marry middle school students, middle school students want to marry college students; college students want to marry students studying abroad; this is tantamount to lowering their status and showing a psychology of dependence, which I cannot agree with. Any woman must first overcome all kinds of weaknesses before she can be accomplished." She also talked about the situation of female students studying in the East, which can be divided into two categories: (1) Hard-working and self-improving students, who have a definite purpose and come to study, and their spirit is admirable. (2) Those who are muddling through with their studies abroad, regardless of the cost of being abroad, and only seeking their own false fame. There are also many female students from the three northeastern provinces, some of whom have forgotten their motherland and recognize the enemy as their father, which is so heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Ms. Lu is originally from Nanhai, grew up in Guangzhou, studied in Shanghai for many years, and was a classmate of Xie Bingying, Chen Boer, and Wang Ying at the Shanghai Art University. She has been studying in Japan for two years and is studying sociology at Hosei University in Tokyo. She also likes drama, swimming, volleyball, etc. In the past six months, she has starred in plays such as "A Woman and a Dog," "Ranch Brothers," and "Infant Slaughter" at the Tsukiji Little Theater, which were famous at the time. She came back to China this time to see the dynamic of the society in the two years since she left the country. She will return to Japan soon. After graduating in two years, she is willing to devote herself to women's movement. With such a young and strong new woman, her future will definitely be very great.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Rural Women in Nantong <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Kangbo</p>
<p>I once wrote an article in the Shenbao Monthly about the lives of women in Nantong. In that article, "I divided the women in Nantong into three classes; the so-called three classes are: 1. Urban pleasure-seeking women, 2. Female students, 3. Rural women. However, in this article, there is an overly detailed description of the living conditions of the first two types of women, while the report on the daily lives of rural women is sketchy; after writing this article, I had the opportunity to edit a women's publication for a period of time. Because of this work, I have a better understanding of the lives of women in Nantong, especially in the rural areas. Therefore, I am making a supplementary account here.</p>
<p>If we calculate by proportion, the number of rural women in Nantong accounts for two-thirds of the total number of women in Nantong: It is extremely disappointing to talk about the education these rural women have received. Among them, those who have received compulsory education are considered to have received the highest education. Usually, most of them are illiterate. Women who have sat on the bench in private schools for a year or two can boast in the countryside. At present, except for the villages near the city, the custom of cutting hair and unbinding feet has not yet penetrated into the remote areas. In addition to sewing and cooking, these women are also a good group of helpers during the busy farming season. In the past, when Nantong cloth was still selling well, the men and women in the countryside used weaving as a sideline, and worked day and night. Therefore, a hard-working woman could get a reward of more than half a dollar every day as a result of her hard work. However, since the decline of Nantong cloth, this rich income has been lost for no reason. In today's Nantong rural areas, even self-cultivating farmers with a few acres of thin land can hardly survive. A group of small tenant farmers who are exploited by high interest rates have driven their wives and daughters to the city without hesitation. Usually, they serve as servants in the homes of the general middle class (called old maids in Nanjing). The remuneration received by this type of women is from one to two yuan per month, and those with good "extra income" can get three or four yuan, but usually it is less than three yuan.</p>
<p>The system of child brides is still very popular in the countryside of Nantong today. Generally, people without considerable property seek a child bride after giving birth to their children, and some even arrange marriages while still in the womb. Child brides usually get married before the age of twenty after they grow up. Some live in peace after marriage, while others undergo changes, so news of leaving their homes and villages often fills the streets.</p>
<p>There are also many special industries for women in Nantong's rural areas. The common one is selling fruits or food. When they encounter festivals, they collect all the seasonal or scenic items for sale in order to earn small profits. Some women with stronger physiques often come to the city to push or carry goods. They can carry or push heavy carts weighing about a hundred pounds, and they can walk like flying.</p>
<p>All year round, they are tempered by a life of hardship. The first month of the new year is a relatively pleasant and relaxing season for them, and this season is also abundant in terms of material enjoyment. Otherwise, the welcoming gods and temple fairs between autumn and winter every year? They can also have a good time, but that is just a day or two of revelry.</p>
<h3 id="e252">The Grief of Ancient Chinese Women Poetesses (1) <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Tun</p>
<p>Parting, death, yearning for spring, growing old,</p>
<p>Losing love, being abandoned, mismatched, war and chaos.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, beautiful women have often had ill-fated lives, and talented people have often had ill-fated lives as well. But looking at the literary works of women poetesses of past dynasties, how much grief they contain, one can imagine their unfortunate encounters and inner pain. The analysis of women's grief is nothing more than parting, death, yearning for spring, growing old, losing love, being abandoned, resentment of being mismatched, resentment of war, chaos, and national subjugation, etc. This is the same for human emotions, and it has always been the same throughout the ages.</p>
<p>The Grief of Parting</p>
<p>"Sorrow is greater than separation, joy is greater than meeting," Qu Yuan has already made it clear in one sentence. In poetry, parting verses almost account for the highest number, which is truly innumerable. The most euphemistic and moving depiction of the grief of ordinary parting should be the poem on the plate by the wife of Su Boyu of the Han Dynasty:</p>
<p>"The mountain tree is tall, the crow crows sadly; the spring water is deep, the carp is fat; the empty granary sparrow often suffers from hunger; the official's wife rarely meets her husband. Going out to look, seeing white clothes, thinking it was him, but it was not. Returning home, my heart is sad... I often sigh, who can I tell? You have a journey, I miss you. Going out has a date, returning has no date. Tying my girdle, I miss you for a long time. You forget me, I don't know it; I forget you, the crime should be punished... Living in Chang'an, my body is in Shu, why not regret the horse's hooves and return frequently!..."</p>
<p>The poem on the plate is just a representative work of reluctance to part. As for the true parting verses, which are full of sorrow and penetrate the heart, the most important ones should be the song of sorrow by Wang Zhaojun when she went to the frontier, the Eighteen Songs of the Hu Jia by Cai Wenji, and the poem on the wall by Zhou Zhongmei of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the story of Wang Zhaojun. As a delicate and beautiful woman, she was initially not favored in the Han Palace, but was later selected to be the wife of the Xiongnu Kingdom, far away in a foreign land, with no relatives to look up to. How sad should her heart be! Although the lament poem is only a hundred words long, her whole life experience is on paper.</p>
<p>"Autumn trees are luxuriant, their leaves are withered and yellow, there are crows in the mountains, gathering on the mulberry bushes, raising feathers, their appearance is bright. Having ascended into the clouds, swimming in the crooked room, leaving the palace is desolate, my body is broken, my will is suppressed, unable to fly up. Although I am fed, my heart is hesitant. Why am I alone, my coming and going is unusual, fluttering swallows, gathering far in the Western Qiang. High mountains are towering, the river water is vast, father and mother, the road is long. Alas, my heart is sad!"</p>
<p>Cai Wenji, as the daughter of a famous writer of a generation, encountered many national disasters. She was initially captured by the Hu people, separated from her father and far away, and became the queen of the Left Sage King. She lived in the Hu for twelve years and gave birth to two sons. Later, she was allowed to return to the Han land, but she could not take her two sons with her. She remarried and became the wife of Dong Si of Chenliu. Let us see her sorrow when she left the Han and entered the Hu:</p>
<p>"Leaving the Han country and entering the Hu city, losing my family and body is not as good as not being born! Wearing felt robes, my flesh and blood are shocked; taking mutton as food, I wrongly suppress my feelings. Drums are noisy, from night to dawn. The Hu wind is vast, darkening the fortress... (Third Beat)</p>
<p>"... Natural disasters and national chaos leave people without a master, only my fate is thin and I am dead as a prisoner. Different customs and hearts make it difficult to live; different desires, who can I talk to!" (Fourth Beat)</p>
<p>"If heaven has eyes, why does it not see me drifting alone! If the gods are spiritual, why do they place me alone in the north and south of the world! I have not failed heaven, why does heaven make me a different match! I have not failed the gods, why do the gods kill me beyond the desolate state!..." (Eighth Beat)</p>
<p>Living in a foreign land, the only comfort she had was her two biological sons. When she left the Hu and returned to the Han, the separation of mother and son was more painful than ever.</p>
<p>"... My body returns to the country, but my children do not follow, my heart is hanging and always hungry... The mountains are high and the land is vast, seeing you has no date!..." (Fourteenth Beat)</p>
<p>"... The separation of mother and son is difficult to bear, separated by the same sky is like Shang and Shen. Not knowing whether they are alive or dead, where can I find them!..." (Fifteenth Beat)</p>
<p>"... When I left, I missed the homeland but had no clue; when I came, I said goodbye to my children, my thoughts were vast!..." (Seventeenth Beat)</p>
<p>In her "Ode to Grief and Indignation," she described her initial encounters in detail, revealing her heart and lungs, making people feel infinite sorrow when reading it. This should be the swan song of the unfortunate parting of women in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhongmei first followed her father to Chengdu as an official, and married a husband surnamed Li. She followed her husband to Nanjing as an official. Later, her husband had a favored concubine, the family was not harmonious, and he abandoned his official position and went to Mount Hua without returning. Zhongmei took her son and lived in her maternal grandfather's house in Hefei, and could not return. When her uncle was appointed to Changsha, they were all loaded south, so she wrote her thoughts on the wall:</p>

<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Probably because the weather is too hot, Grandpa Song's temper seems to be much worse than usual. The small fake mahogany tea table was slapped up and down, left and right by him, and it was creaking and groaning, almost losing its life under his palm.</p>
<p>Grandpa Song has a total of five brothers. He is the oldest, so everyone in the family calls him Grandpa Song. Grandpa Song's father, Great-Grandpa Song, had served as a few terms of telecommunications supervision and had some savings. In addition to the first wife, he also married two concubines. Grandpa Song and Second Grandpa Tao were raised by the first wife, and they came from the most upright background, so their power was also the greatest; Third Grandpa and Fourth Grandpa were raised by the first concubine. Although the first concubine had died long ago, these two grandpas were doing very well outside, so they still had a considerable status in the family; Fifth Grandpa was the youngest, raised by the second concubine. Great-Grandpa Song died as soon as he landed, so in the eyes of Grandpa Song and Second Grandpa Tao, Fifth Grandpa was really like a kitten or puppy, unworthy of attention. But in the heart of the second concubine, she had endured nine years of lowering her head and serving the small since she married Great-Grandpa Song at the age of seventeen, and she finally gave birth to this son. How could she not hope that he would be a reliance in the future? Therefore, during the initial mourning period of Great-Grandpa Song, the second concubine had a quarrel with Grandpa Song over the name on the thank you note and the thickness of the hemp clothes.</p>
<p>As soon as Great-Grandpa Song died, Grandpa Song was the head of the family. How could the second concubine argue with him like this without making him angry? Moreover, not only that, in Grandpa Song's calculations, when the inheritance was divided in the future, Fifth Grandpa would definitely not have a share. Unable to withstand the second concubine's quarrel, his name was on the thank you note, and there would definitely be problems in the future. Therefore, Grandpa Song was not only angry, but simply "anger arose from his heart, and evil grew from his courage." He could not wait to execute the second concubine and Fifth Grandpa immediately, but in a clear and bright world, with everyone watching, how could he commit such a poisonous hand! There was no way but to temporarily endure and slowly seek a good plan.</p>
<p>After a while, Grandpa Song's good plan finally came up.</p>
<p>One day, Grandpa Song and Second Grandpa Tao actually caught a wild man in the second concubine's room. Although this person was not naked and barefoot, and the second concubine herself cried and shouted for injustice, Grandpa Song insisted that this person was indeed her adulterer, and immediately slammed the table and stomped his feet in the hall, insisting on expelling the second concubine. The people in the family persuaded and laughed, but they all leaned towards Grandpa Song. The second concubine had no family members to help, and did not know how to use the law to clear her injustice. She could not withstand Grandpa Song's persistent coercion, so she had to let them dispose of her. She hastily packed a large bundle, left her beloved son who was still breastfeeding, and cried out with tears and snot.</p>
<p>The next night, Grandpa Song passed by Wenkang Bridge and saw many people surrounding a female corpse that had just been fished out of the river, making a fuss and talking about it. Without turning his head to look, Grandpa Song had already understood in his heart.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Gonorrhea must be radically cured while preserving reproductive ability <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>The disease of leukorrhea progresses with civilization, and gonorrhea drugs prosper with science. Since so many people are infected with gonorrhea, and patients do not fully understand the common sense of drug selection, they are dazzled by the variety and wander aimlessly, not knowing what to do. I cannot help but worry about the patients and cannot help but speak out. Therefore, I would like to mention two important points: one is that it cannot be cured radically, and the other is that it impairs offspring. Sterilization is indeed an important task in treating gonorrhea, but when bacteria enter the sperm system and mix among the sperm, if the medicine is too strong, then both the sperm and gonorrhea bacteria will be destroyed. Those who do not understand the meaning of avoiding harming the container while trying to kill the rat are not qualified to talk about the ability to cure gonorrhea. Therefore, selecting gonorrhea drugs is not possible without being proficient in medical and pharmaceutical principles.</p>
<p>German scientific inventions are the best in the world, and medical progress is rare. There are many people who have devoted themselves to the research of gonorrhea treatment and drug selection. Recently, Dr. Jadassohn published that in order to radically cure gonorrhea while preserving offspring, it is necessary to focus on both penetrating the membrane to kill bacteria and increasing resistance. The most effective bactericidal agent is Acridn, and the best way to increase resistance is Vaccin (vaccine). Based on this experience, the doctor carefully studied and finally invented "Antirrhea," a combined preparation of oral yellow pigment and vaccine. After taking it, it has the effect of inoculation without the drawbacks of injection. The body's resistance is greatly improved, gonorrhea bacteria have no way to spread, local lesions return to their original tissue, and gonorrhea bacteria have no way to survive. As for its functions of eliminating inflammation and detoxification, reducing swelling and pain, preventing decay and generating new tissue, and promoting diuresis and purifying turbidity, it is beyond the reach of old gonorrhea drugs. It does not recur after recovery, and the examination shows that the gonorrhea bacteria have disappeared and the sperm are still lively. The purpose of radical cure is achieved, and the reproductive function is also healthy. It is truly the gospel of gonorrhea patients and the holy product among gonorrhea drugs.</p>
<h3 id="e255">A Letter from a Rescued Youth <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: As I write this letter, I don't know how much consideration it took, hesitating again and again. Ultimately, the shame in my heart could not defeat the attack of pain, and I finally summoned my courage to reveal the source of my illness without concealment. Mr., I only recognize you as my sole savior, because I have suffered three years of pain due to my illness. Now? There is already some hope of recovery, perhaps life can be preserved!? I am very ashamed, I am a young man with the bad habit of masturbation. Why would a promising young man abandon himself like this? Sir! Please don't blame me like this. Because if you do, I will have no place to hide my face. Doing this kind of thing started three years ago, and in the final analysis, it was caused by obscene books! In the beginning, the terrible seminal emissions occurred almost every night, fighting against my life. Therefore, I sought various medical remedies, wanting to preserve my life. So, I consulted a specialist physician and took "Shimitu's Semen-Solidifying Pills," which are effective for seminal emissions. It was cured, but I thought "Shimitu's Semen-Solidifying Pills," although seminal emission was quickly cured by it, but neurasthenia is still so rampant. According to friends, it is because the semen is too wasted, so the gonads are destroyed by it, and they introduced me to a medicine, which is said to be able to restore the vigor of the gonads, the medicine is called "Gonadogen." So, for the sake of prudence, I have to make my illness public and ask you to make a decision for me! I hope to get a reply immediately! Sincerely, Wang Jiechen.</p>
<p>(Brief Answer): Since the seminal emission has been cured, life can be preserved without worry, but you must abstain from masturbation. The "Gonadogen" recommended by your friend can indeed nourish the essence and blood and restore decline. You can buy and take it with confidence from Huamei Pharmacy, and all neurasthenia can be cured. (The Editor's Answer)</p>
<h3 id="e256">Amidst the Anti-Smoking Campaign... Gospel of Quitting Smoking <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The end of the 25th year of the Republic of China is the final deadline for quitting smoking. It is also the doomsday for smokers. If they still disregard the public order, the government will only regard them as abandoned people and inflict extreme punishment. Recently, there have often been executions of tobacco offenders and drug dealers in various places. It can be seen that the government is determined to ban smoking and eliminate drugs. All my patients, if they become addicted to smoking due to illness and pain, or if they stop halfway when illnesses appear during quitting, their condition is pitiful, and their situation is sympathetic. But if they do not turn back in time, the arrival of the death penalty is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is not difficult. The difficulty lies in safety. The key to safety is to remove the illnesses, treat the weakness, eliminate the tobacco toxins, and break the smoking addiction. To seek a good medicine for quitting smoking that has all four of these qualities, only "Gonadogen" can be called a giant. Because of its great efficacy, it is truly the gospel for those who quit smoking.</p>
<p>(Note) Women should take "Female Gonadogen" when quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease Lecture</p>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianceng &amp; Dr. Yao Erchang (Co-compiled)</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>The more civilized society becomes, the more prevalent venereal diseases become. Those infectious venereal diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea, already have "606" and "Antilin" which are effective for radical cure, so I will not repeat them here. What I am discussing now is non-infectious seminal emission, kidney atrophy, and premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>The source of this disease is actually caused by the decline of vitality and the lack of gonadotropic hormone. In women, there are symptoms such as irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, and breast atrophy, and loss of beauty. The treatment is naturally based on gonadotropic hormone preparation "Gonadogen." For seminal emission, "Shimitu's Semen-Solidifying Pills" should be taken together. For leucorrhea, "Therapeutic Bandage Spirit" should be used externally at the same time. Then, men and women with venereal diseases and hidden illnesses can easily treat themselves secretly according to the law.</p>
<p>(1) Physical Weakness, Sexual Weakness, and Heavy Smoking Addiction</p>
<p>Patient Yang Yinghua. 38 years old. Local. Business community. (Chief complaint) Physical weakness, sexual weakness. Sallow complexion. Sore waist and back. Heavy smoking addiction. (Medical history) — Mr. Yang has been addicted to smoking for many years. He started smoking in the brothels to gain excitement in his early years. Once the smoking addiction was formed, the poisoning became deeper. The whole body became weak, and all kinds of morbid states appeared. Repeated attempts to quit were difficult to eliminate. He suffered unspeakable pain. Soreness in the waist and back. Showing premature aging. Last winter, he was introduced by his close friend Mr. So-and-so to come for consultation. (Treatment) — In addition to performing the latest scientific surgery and painless electrotherapy, I also instructed him to purchase "Gonadogen" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to invigorate his weakness and treat his venereal disease, and use "Strong Bone Pain Pills" to treat his soreness. The ailments were eliminated. Because "Gonadogen" has the special effect of eliminating toxins and breaking addiction, he safely quit smoking after taking it for more than a month.</p>
<p>(2) Amenorrhea, Yellow Discharge, and Breast Atrophy</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Lin Yubo. 27 years old. Guangdong native. (Chief complaint) Amenorrhea — yellow discharge. Physical weakness. Flat breasts. (Medical history) — Before marriage, Mrs. Lin suffered from congenital deficiency and physical weakness, and there was uterine fire and discharge. Every time she menstruated, she was also irregular. After marriage, due to excessive labor, her body became weaker. This spring, due to amenorrhea and yellow discharge, Mr. Lin came with her for consultation. (Treatment) — I mainly used "Female Gonadogen" to strengthen the uterus, remove inflammation, regulate menstruation, and nourish deficiency, and externally used "Therapeutic Bandage Spirit" to treat her discharge. Mrs. Lin should purchase it from the Sino-British Pharmacy. Internal and external treatments were applied according to the law. Before a month had passed, all her ailments were eliminated. The breasts regained good development, fully expressing the beauty that a young woman should have.</p>

<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Many people suffer from bone and joint pain. Those who are not treated properly will be delayed for a long time and regarded as stubborn diseases. Those who ignore and do not treat them are everywhere. As a result, hundreds of diseases occur, leading to limb numbness, leg soreness, muscle spasms, and paralysis. In severe cases, there is excessive uric acid and unclean blood, arteriosclerosis, and the risk of hemorrhage. If bone pain and limb numbness are already like being disabled and losing freedom, if they are not treated quickly, there will be a disaster of stroke and sudden collapse in the future. How can they be ignored?</p>
<p>Bone and joint pain has various causes, so its treatment should also be taken into account. It is essential to dispel wind and dampness, eliminate residual toxins, relieve soreness, and relieve throbbing pain. As for clearing the blood and removing uric acid, it should not be neglected. The key to radical cure lies in this. The reason why the famous bone pain medicine "Strong Duns' Bone Pain Pills" can achieve the most magnificent miraculous effect is that its medicinal power can have all of the above-mentioned functions.</p>

<p>— Physician Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Yu: Suffered from rheumatism and bone pain for more than ten years. Repeatedly took various medicines, but it was difficult to cure radically. He regarded it as a stubborn disease and delayed treatment. In recent years, he often felt numbness in his limbs and soreness in his muscles, which was exhausting and unbearable. Later, after reading a certain medical magazine, he realized that there was a risk of arteriosclerosis, blood vessel rupture, stroke, and sudden collapse in the future. He then came to me for treatment. After my diagnosis, Mr. Yu had internal rheumatism and excessive uric acid. It was difficult to achieve miraculous results without taking the famous medicine "Strong Duns' Bone Pain Pills." Mr. Yu should purchase it from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take it as directed. After taking less than five boxes, all his ailments disappeared. Years of gout suddenly disappeared. Mr. Yu expressed his deep gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Common Diseases of Young People and Infertility After Prolonged Marriage <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a disease that is increasing day by day. The most common ones are seminal emission, premature ejaculation, and impotence. It is sometimes referred to as a common disease. Patients are especially numerous among young people. Because the world is declining, morality is lost, and human desires are rampant. There are many stimuli, which are most likely to cause diseases of the sexual nerves.</p>
<p>Seminal emission is mostly caused by excessive masturbation. The patient's vas deferens is relaxed. With a slight induction, it will spontaneously emit. The treatment mainly lies in consolidating the essence. "Shimitu's Semen-Solidifying Pills" is the best. The medicinal properties are kingly and suitable for the Chinese physique. It has miraculous effects in treating seminal emission, nocturnal emission, and other symptoms. However, after the seminal emission is cured, it is especially important to use "Gonadogen" to replenish the essence.</p>
<p>In addition to masturbation, premature ejaculation is also easily suffered by those who have excessive sex. The root of the disease lies in the weakness of the gonads. Therefore, the most effective treatment is gonadotropic hormone preparation "Gonadogen."</p>
<p>Impotence refers to kidney weakness and local atrophy. Although the source of the disease is divided into congenital and acquired, the lack of gonadotropic hormone is the same. Therefore, the most effective treatment is to take "Gonadogen" internally.</p>
<p>(1) Seminal Emission Saved!</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Xu: Committing masturbation in his youth, he felled his body every day. He depleted too much and suffered from essence depletion and brain weakness, resulting in seminal emission, insomnia, and other symptoms. Repeated medications were ineffective. He suffered unspeakable pain. After my introduction, he purchased "Shimitu's Semen-Solidifying Pills" from Wing On Company to consolidate the essence, and took "Gonadogen" to replenish the essence. After taking it for about a month, his ailments were eliminated and he regained his health.</p>
<p>(2) Premature Ejaculation Cured!</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Mu: He married too early and did not know how to restrain himself, resulting in sexual destruction. He suffered from premature ejaculation and showed hundreds of symptoms of neurasthenia, which was exhausting and unbearable. In addition to introducing him to Physician Zhan Nianceng for electrotherapy, he also took "Gonadogen." After taking less than half a dozen, the premature ejaculation was cured. He regained his health and regained his vitality.</p>
<p>(3) Impotence Vanished Suddenly!</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhong: He was congenitally weak and had many diseases. Improper conditioning. Incomplete development. The local area was slender. Since I introduced him to Physician Zhan Nianceng for electrotherapy, I also instructed him to take "Gonadogen" to promote development. The muscles of the whole body immediately became strong and sturdy, and the local area also returned to its spectacular appearance. He happily thanked him and left.</p>

<h3 id="e262">What Will Happen After Various Countries Raise the White Flag? <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>After I wrote an article entitled "Various Countries Hang Up the White Flag of Truce" in the supplement the other day, I felt that I had not fully expressed myself, so I will elaborate on it again.</p>
<p>The League of Nations (actually, it is England and France) is deeply afraid that if the sanctions are not lifted, the German-Italian alliance will become a reality, and the collective security system will inevitably disintegrate. Unexpectedly, the sanctions were lifted, and the situation of Germany and Italy became closer. The League of Nations could not avoid being fooled by Italy. In fact, the countries of England and France may not know this situation. Even if the sanctions are lifted, they may not be able to restore the fate of collective security. However, if the sanctions are not lifted, and in fact, among the countries that decided to impose sanctions, several countries have been intimidated by Italy's false声势 and do not fulfill their obligations, the sanctions front has already been shaken. Therefore, it is difficult to lift the sanctions, and it is also difficult not to lift them. It is better to lift them, one to eliminate the current crisis, and the other to leave some room in the hope of restoring the old feelings.</p>
<p>The success or failure of a business, the victory or defeat of using troops, are common. What is terrible is that after the failure, looking at the victorious country's arrogant state and sarcastic tone, the most deeply stimulated is like this time when various countries lifted the sanctions against Italy. Mussolini's speech mixed with laughter, saying that all countries that participated in the sanctions against Italy on this day raised the white flag of truce on the wall of their sanctions front. This kind of speech, which was sarcastic and provocative, was extremely painful and embarrassing for all the countries that participated in the sanctions against Italy. The lesson we learned from this incident is that in the modern world, no country can succeed without acting recklessly, and no country can defend itself without acting recklessly. If I take a step back, the enemy will take a step forward. If I take ten steps back, the enemy will take ten steps forward. As a result, I will have no place to stand.</p>
<p>Mussolini's arrogant and mocking speech, after the countries that raised the white flag heard it, would they just suffer in silence? Or would they try to find a way to resolve this disaster? This is natural. Any small country, any small animal, must have some resistance. It will never disappear without a trace and be slaughtered and bullied by others without drawing a knife. Moreover, England and France are super powers. They will never be at a loss and be manipulated by others. And looking at the current posture of Germany and Italy, their ambitions are very flourishing. This is not the end. Therefore, England and France's way of dealing with Germany and Italy is not only to avenge the past humiliation, but also to prevent the future disaster.</p>
<p>What methods will England and France use to deal with the current and future situation? This is really a question worth studying. Among the European powers, except for Germany and Italy, the others are small countries. Even if they unite, they will never be able to compete with Germany and Italy. In addition, the United States and Russia have the same purpose as England and France, and their strength is also relatively strong. However, the two countries are geographically isolated. Moreover, Russia is afraid of Japan attacking its rear if something happens in Europe, and the United States has always adhered to the Monroe Doctrine and is originally unwilling to advise on the overall situation in Europe. Therefore, looking around among the powers, there is no one who can join hands with them. If England and France want to use the strategy of maneuvering and deception, they will not be able to do so.</p>
<p>Then, will England and France have absolutely no way to deal with it? That is not the case. In this environment, not only the current difficulties cannot be dealt with, but the future situation is even more tense. The attack of these successive difficult problems is mostly a warning to the current world. It is definitely not a situation of peace, prosperity, and luxury, and it cannot be solved by maneuvering, deception, and false声恫喝. Self-improvement is not enough to seek survival, and self-reliance is not enough to save oneself. The only thing to do is to work hard and vigorously expand military preparations, preparing to fight to the death on the sea, land, and air fronts one day. What else can be imagined? Therefore, the current situation is mostly creating the seeds of the Second World War.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Fishing Boat <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Jiaqian</p>
<p>A small fishing boat came to the little river, like an ordinary艒艒 boat, which is a home that floats on the water all year round. They are an old couple. Calling them an old couple is just our estimate based on their appearance, which is formed by being tortured by life all year round, without good nutrition, and without good clothing. Perhaps they are in their prime.</p>
<p>Although the tributary of that small river just starts here, the market has already ended here. Continuing down the tributary from here are the desolate graves of this place. Except for two people often carrying a coffin passing by here, there are no other passers-by. The fishing boat seemed very satisfied that they had found such a suitable place. After a few arrows, they saw that no one came to interfere with their fishing career (they often encountered such unreasonable expulsion), and they gradually moved from the water to the land. They planted bamboo poles on the ground, tied them with a rope, and晒their tattered clothes; they dug a hole on the edge of the water浜 and placed their cooking stove. Except for sleeping, their daily life was completely moved to the ground.</p>
<p>They catch fish twice a day, when the tide comes and goes. They have a large net, and they娘it on the bottom of the river, facing the direction of the tide. The couple runs to the very center of the river. When the tide is high, only two heads can be seen floating in the water. They both hold a triangular pole in their hands, slowly moving their bodies in the center of the river, while moving the two triangular</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>bamboo poles, going in the direction of the fish net. Because the whole body is immersed in the water, the body weight is out of balance, and the stones and glass shards in the center of the river often prick their feet, it takes at least half an hour to catch a net of fish. When they climb out of the center of the river like water ghosts, they have no time to worry about their bodies. They have to quickly收 the fish net, otherwise, their half-hour effort will be completely wasted. It is easy to put down the net, but when收 it, the net already has a large harvest. Sometimes, broken things沉 in the bottom of the river are often caught in the net together with the fish, and they are standing on the bow of the boat, using force to bend their bodies to收 the net, against the推進power of the tide. The small boat often straightens its stern as if it cannot bear the burden. Watching them收 the net, I always think of the tragic situation of seeing a fishing boat being swallowed by huge waves on the beach that year.</p>
<p>A big net of fish is piled on the bow of the boat. Those leaping, shining fish scales release clouds of hope in the eyes of the couple. Now they should have forgotten their wet clothes. They happily open the mouth of the net and separate the big fish from the small fish in buckets. The procedure is so fast that the sand and gravel are thrown into the river at hand, and the卜通卜通 sounds are connected. So, with smiles on their faces, they changed their clothes and went to the market to sell them.</p>
<p>But收 up a large net of broken things is also not in the minority. They naturally feel very disappointed after spending half an hour of effort. However, they are not afraid of hardship, and they immediately go to the bottom of the river to set up the net again, because they cannot let go of the power of the short-term tide.</p>
<p>Dinner is their happiest time: the old man (we can only call him that, although he himself said he was thirty-eight years old) 打 a bottle of wine, buys a little pig's head meat, or burns the small fish they caught themselves, and the couple eats dinner. Sometimes we can also hear the old man drinking their hometown's private情山歌.</p>
<p>Watching them net fish seems to have become a habit. I almost take my younger brother to the small river浜 every day. But in less than half a month, the fishing boat was escorted out of the country by the police. It is said that someone reported to the police station that they were翻動the river, hindering the three-year开河工程 of the opening river bureau, and affecting the drinking water hygiene of the citizens.</p>
<p>I thought that if these two charges were established, the old couple should be locked up in jail. Escorting them out of the country is really too cheap a punishment! But they can't fish on land. They are永家 for home, no,以水为生, then, where are they going to fish? This question troubled me for a long time, and those two simple faces often appeared in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>— Ai Cha</p>
<p>A bustling road, a row of old buildings near a crossroads, one of which has hung up the sign "Sunshine Electroplate Studio." The June sun shines like a fireball, reflecting a dazzling light from the newly whitewashed facade.</p>
<p>Inside this electroplate studio, the three junior partners, all friends, are slowly preparing to start work. However, the June sun is so hot that it makes one dizzy, especially in the workshop set up on the terrace. The sun blazes down on the zinc-iron roof, filling the space with a pungent, sour smell of chemicals mixed with the heart-piercing odor of strong acids. This mixture of smells, combined with the scorching sun, makes one feel suffocated upon inhaling.</p>
<p>It's not yet time to start work, but the three partners already have differing opinions. Old Chen, who owns the majority of the capital, a sharp-headed, sharp-tongued fellow, looks at the other two with his head tilted. All three pairs of eyes are fixedly staring at the sun.</p>
<p>"The electroplate studio next door only does five-point paper (Note 1). We, on the other hand, do six-point paper."</p>
<p>Chen, who manages the finances, shakes his head in this way.</p>
<p>"What can we do? There are over thirty electroplate studios in the provincial capital. But doing five-point paper per inch is really losing money. Chemicals have gone up in price, the exchange rate for Western paper is very high, and zinc plates have risen from five and a half to eight dollars. Calculating the bare minimum, each inch of newspaper costs more than three points of paper. Wasting a little will cost four points of paper, and then there's food, rent, and other expenses. Really, it would be great if we could just earn enough for food!"</p>
<p>This is what Little Liu, the experienced one, says.</p>
<p>Old Qian blinks, and says with great confidence:</p>
<p>"I think that you have no work to do in the shop, just looking at the numbers, while the two of us make electroplates. You also get a share of the salary. So, the best way is for you to voluntarily do calligraphy and painting. For every order of fifty inches of electroplates or more, we give away ordinary calligraphy and painting—actually, you could earn forty or fifty dollars just by doing advertisement paintings!"</p>
<p>"I'm willing, but: if I write volunteer paintings, my business will also decrease."</p>
<p>Old Chen says a little displeased, taking a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"Then! Our conditions also have to change a little!" Old Qian says, his heart filled with desires to plan for himself: "I am the dedicated expert of the photography department! Besides photography, I don't have to care about the work of electroplating, and my salary should be more than anyone else, because, my share of capital is also a lot!"</p>
<p>"How can that be!" Little Liu shouts angrily, his cheekbones appearing even higher: "It's okay for you to do photography, but it's not right for you not to make electroplates. Do you know that the work of electroplating is five times more than photography! You want to enjoy yourself? And you say your salary should be more than others. We don't even know how much business we have! Business is not easy to do, what salary are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Little Liu's eyes are also flashing with flames. He continues:</p>
<p>"I earn more salary than you from 'running horses' (Note 2)! I do thirty yuan of work, you only do twenty yuan of work! Really..."</p>
<p>In this way, he regrets pulling Old Qian into partnering in this electroplate studio at that time. Wave after wave of thoughts surge: "I really don't want to continue, I won't even take business anymore. With such disputes, I would rather let it go bankrupt."</p>
<p>The three people's thoughts are jumping in the waves. The sun is staring wide-eyed at the earth. They jointly feel the authority of the sun's light, and quietly sigh.</p>
<p>The Sunshine Electroplate Studio, under each person's private opinions, finally starts work. Everyone has their own worries. Old Chen desperately writes his own advertisement paintings, attempting to earn more income. Old Qian, this specialist technician, is a bit anxious, because the old projector is not easy to use. He spent a lot of energy, but only projected photos that were not of top quality. Little Liu is completely sloppy about his work. Business comes in slowly, and starting electroplates is slow. Supporting it like this, there is no improvement, and it shows signs of indifference. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The situation has been changing, the importance of which we discuss. The spirit of the nation is declining, while foreign clans are becoming stronger. China originated in Kunlun. The eastward migration started from the Xia and Shang dynasties of Yu the Great. The Zhou dynasty lasted for eight hundred years, and the royal family was granted land in all four directions. The Central Plains and the Huaxia people gradually declined, and the Yi, Man, Rong, and Di tribes became wilderness. There were many miracles in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The Qin Dynasty unified the entire country. Tyrannical and despotic, the Qin Dynasty was truly autocratic. The uprising of beheading the snake produced Liu Bang. He pleaded for the people and destroyed Qin and Chu. (Relying only on) Han Xin, Xiao He, and Zhang Liang. After five generations, Emperor Zhao ascended the throne. (At that time) the Eastern Kou (倭寇) were very strong and overbearing. They committed adultery, plundered, and seized everything. The coastal residents lacked peace and well-being. Fertile land became barren. A vast expanse of thousands of miles was a wasteland. National heroes rose up in time. They became generals and prime ministers like Huo Guang. (They slaughtered) ships, destroyed masts, and the invaders' heads fell. Their souls scattered, and they fled to the ocean. From then on, the coastal people enjoyed peace and prosperity. The three words "Great General" have spread far and wide. His name will be famous for ten thousand generations.</p>

<p>RKO Pictures of America sent cinematographer Herbert, led by Zhou Ke, to China to shoot a short news film with the theme "The Progress of the Times." Yesterday, they visited Yi Hua. Yu Suling's film "Little Sisters" was being filmed, so in addition to visiting all the facilities, they also observed the filming of "Little Sisters." They finally left with great interest after a long time.</p>

<h3 id="e271">"The Good Earth" in Production <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Regarding the production of the Chinese film "The Good Earth" by MGM, this publication has previously recorded some information. Now, we have obtained some more news about the film, which we have translated and recorded below.</p>
<p>The set for "The Good Earth" is located a few miles outside of Los Angeles, with a Chinese-style village and several thatched huts, just like what can be seen in the Chinese mainland. There is also a mill turned by water buffalo and a waterwheel used to irrigate the land. It is said that the fields, spanning over five hundred acres, are entirely cultivated by an elderly overseas Chinese farmer using the traditional methods of his homeland.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Wang Lung, is played by Paul Muni. He wears grass sandals, a baggy blue bamboo cloth long shirt, a long red silk belt around his waist, and a small braid hanging behind his neck.</p>
<p>O-Lan is played by Ms. Lu Rainer. Her attire is strangely shaped, not very much like the O-Lan described in Ms. Pearl Buck's book.</p>
<p>There are many supporting actors from our country playing farmers and their wives. During filming, several farmers even drove water buffalo brought from their hometowns. Among them is a sixty-seven-year-old man, Li Changfu, and the chairman of the Cantonese Welfare Association in San Francisco, a person of status who likes acting.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy actress is Ms. Liu Lude, who is of Chinese descent. Her father is Chinese and currently works for the National Government, but her mother is American. With an Eastern-style face and speaking English, she is a purely American girl of only ten years old, playing the role of Lotus, wearing a short jacket, baggy pants, and a head full of flowers, looking just like a Suzhou prostitute.</p>
<p>"The Good Earth" is worth noting because, although it claims to be based on Ms. Pearl Buck's original book, based on past facts and the various observations currently underway, it will undoubtedly succeed in making a film that insults China. At the very least, it will not be very flattering to China.</p>
