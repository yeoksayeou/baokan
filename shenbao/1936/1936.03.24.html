<p>我中華民族欲圖永久國基之培養作統一的建設使非常事變之起可以應付則西南諸省之交通網之完成為最迫切之要求四川為復興民族最合宜之根據地故其與東南諸省之聯絡與國際海口之溝通更為要圖論者謂四川為中華民族之「堪察加」成都為中華民族之「安哥拉」然今日之四川南旣不能通香港昆明西亦無由與長沙武漢相聯接吾人欲退到「堪察加」將由何項路綫吾人欲作長期之抵抗何由與世界各國交通以維持長期抵抗之必要供給故西南鐵路之建設成渝固屬重要粤漢汀黔湘桂之完成亦為迫切之要求而溝通長沙與成都間之鐵路錢更非及早完成不可者也</p>
<p>兩湖與四川間之交通今僅恃長江水道然渝宜之間灘險水急夜間不能行駛白畫尙需引港貨物之運輸不但保險費奇昂且行程迂緩不足以應付非常時期之要求兩廣雲貴與四川間之交通更鳥道羊腸無近代式之運輸機關吾人欲四川一省發揮其價値則宜開闢入川路綫此綫之計畫有主張由貴陽北走越婁山山脈而達重慶以成渝鐵路西達成都以湘黔鐵路東連長沙更有主張延長成渝經過三峽沿長江而達漢口前者困難在于婁山山脈之險惡峻峭工程進行不易且待湘黔綫之完成為時迂緩後者困難在於三峽地勢之絕險沿江兩岸重峰疊嶂欲鑿隧開山所費過鉅據美國工程師之估計宜昌至成都一段建築鐵路每一英哩需欵二十萬元以上</p>
<p>聞鐵道部當局近有川湘鐵路之計畫以為入川之大道此項計畫乃自成渝鐵路南延沿長江而達涪陵再沿烏江而達彭水由彭水東南行越山而入湖南沅陵由沅陵經常德而達長沙長江及烏江之沿岸工程較易沅陵至常德及常德至長沙亦易於進行惟彭水至沅陵間四百公里工程較難然方之婁山之道及巫峽路綫已為容易更在成渝段之內江築支綫至樂山自常德築支綫至沙市則四川與兩湖之交通可不必藉巫峽之險道而成都長沙旣可直達則南下可以藉粤漢而達廣州東上可藉浙湘而聯絡京滬其經濟上政治上國防上之價値甚偉大也</p>
<p>今川渝之綫已在測勘粤漢之綫完成在卽浙湘之間通車有期使成都重慶與長沙間及早取得聯絡則一旦國際戰爭發生進退攻守比較容易香港河內均可為我用民族存亡有賴於此願負責鐵路建設者予以深切之注意也</p>

<h3 id="c96">青年與社會（上） <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>向來社會對於靑年，加以不少的稱號，如「社會的中堅分子」，「民族的干城」，「國家未來的主人翁」等等；可見社會非常看重靑年。但是靑年究竟是不是社會的中堅分子，是不是民族的干城，是不是國家未來的主人翁，要看靑年是不是能立定志向，負起社會的責任。如果靑年能立定志向，負起責任，那末，始不愧有此等稱號；不然，便辜負了社會對於靑年的期望了。</p>
<p>我現在從社會學的立場，說明靑年在社會上地位的重要，靑年對於社會應負的責任，以及靑年應有的修養。意欲使靑年知道自己地位的重要，責任的重大，應有何種準備，以擔負國家社會未來的事業。</p>
<p>靑年在社會上的地位靑年在社會上地位的重要，可從三方面來觀察：</p>
<p>第一，靑年是社會上饅有希望的分子－我們必須知道，靑年是人生最重要的時期，人生一切事業，均在此時期中立定基礎。偉大人物的偉大事業，無不在靑年時代發端。這是就個人的一生言，若就社會方面看來，社會上一切事業，正期待着靑年去擔任。可說全部敎育的過程，正是造就靑年擔負社會一切的事業。所以靑年實在是社會上最有希望的人。社會上看重靑年，期望靑年非常殷切，亦正爲此。我們一知道老年壯年的人，或巳在社會擔負過事業，一或正在社會上擔任事業；他們的希望或已經實現，或正在逐步實現；其成續巳經給予社會相當的印象。譬如偉大的領袖人物，其偉大思想，偉大事業，巳使社會崇拜敬仰。至於一般常入，席碌終生，則又已令社會失望。惟有靑年人的未來事業，可說正是「方興未艾」，給予社會無窮的希望。梁啟超會在少年中國說一文中，比較老年與少年性格的不同，以明少年人希望之大。他說：「老年人常思旣往，少年人常思將來；惟思旣往也故生留戀心，惟思將來也故生希望心；惟留戀也故保守，惟希望也故進取；惟保守也故永舊，惟進取也故日新」。其形容老年人雖未免過分，但其形容少年人希望進取的性格，似甚確當。孔子說：「後生可畏，焉知來者之不如今也」。這也是說靑年人希望最大，故其將來成就，殊未可限量。總之，靑年人爲社會最有希望的分子，可無疑義。</p>
<p>第二，靑年是社會上文化選嬗的樞紐我們必須知道，社會是綿延繼續；社會的分子是新陳代謝的。而靑年人在此新陳代謝的中間，爲承先啟後的樞紐，一方面承受過去社會中一切文物制度思想風習，一方面把現代一切的文物制度思想風習，傳之後代。社會之所以能綿延進化，全賴有此承先啟後的作用，而靑年實負此承先啟後的責任。</p>
<p>第三，靑年是社會進步的原動力－社會所以進步，實賴兩種基本原素：即偉大人物與優良文化。二者又互為因果。優良文化常由偉大人物發明創造，而偉大人物又常受優良文化薰陶孕育。但就大體論，文化畢竟是人類所創造，故偉大人物，實爲社會進步最重要的基本原素。</p>
<p>就歷史看來，一切偉大人物的成就，大都發源於靑年時代。我們現在根據各種偉大人物（如大發明家·大科學家·大思想家·大事業家等）的事蹟，考察他們靑年時代的情形。</p>
<p>大發明家對於發明的興趣，大都起於靑年時代。愛迪生從小就喜歡研究機器，他最初發明各種電氣機械，年僅十餘歲。以後繼續研究，繼續發明，才成爲世界的大發明家。他如韋士登　士的發明空氣制動機，年僅二十三歲。諾貝爾的發明炸藥，其最初發動時，僅二十一歲。柏爾的發明電話機，亦起於二十二歲時；而其發明膺坊臼機，則纔十五歲。亨利福特的喜歡研究機器發明，亦始於十餘歲時。要之，發明家發明的產生，或有遲早；但其發明的動機大率起源於靑年時代。這可見靑年與發明關係的重要了。</p>
<p>大科學家對於科學研究的興趣，亦都起於靑年時代。進化淪的鼻祖達爾文研究生物的興趣，起於十六七歲的時代。最初隨其兄實騐化學，繼於十六歲時入愛丁堡大學，對於動物學允有興趣，自製標本甚多。十七歲即有海產動物的新發見。自此以後，興趣益濃，卒成大科學家。法拉第研究化學的興趣，起於十三四歲時。其爲畫坊學徒，即喜　化學電學等書。工作餘暇，常聽科學演講。此後研究甚力，卒成大科學家。社會學始祖孔德，十司歲時即有社會改進思想，及二十歲時追隨聖西蒙而思想益進步。其鉅著積極哲學的綱要，即成於二十二歲時。斯賓塞的社會思想，在二十歲時已有基礎。二十三一歲發表的論文，其內容主張，終身未變。亞丹斯密的經濟學鉅著原富一書，最初收集材料時，年祇二十一二歲。總之，大科學家的科學研究，都起於靑年時代。</p>
<p>大思想家的思想孕育，亦都在靑年時代。我們且就我國自宋以來幾位著名的學者而言。南宋理學家朱晦菴先生熹，十八歲登進士第，授同安主簿，即選邑中優秀子弟，日興講說聖賢修己治人之道。自是愽求經傳，窮理致知，卒成大儒。陸象山先生九淵，少時即異常兒，讀四書時，便發疑問。嘗謂：宇宙內事，乃己分內事；已分內事，乃宇宙內事。又說：宇宙便是吾心，吾心便是宇宙。自是潛心研究，，就成南宋理學大家，與朱晦齊名。明代王陽明先生守仁，年十八與婁一齊談聖賢之道，便慨然以爲聖人可學而至。可見大思想家在靑年時即已不凡。</p>
<p>大事業家事業的發軔，亦都在資年時代。孫中山先生在少時即以解放中國民族自任。在廣州愽濟醫學校讀書時，不過二十歲，即從事革命運動。美國華盛頓的偉大事業，亦始於靑年時代。當其開始軍事生活，年僅二十二歲。德國鐵而宰相俾士麥，少時即豪邁過人，其在戈登根及柏林大學肄業時，慨然以復與民族自任。意大利建國志士瑪志尼，加里坡的，加富爾，允爲靑年人傑。瑪志尼加入燒炭黨，僅十餘歲；其組織「少年意大利黨」，年方二十五歲。加里坡的加入少年黨，參加愛國運動，亦僅二十二三歲。加富爾少時，即以復興民族自勉。此就歷史上的人物而言，即以現時吾國民族領袖及世界本業家論，亦多在靑年時代巳表現其偉大能力。</p>
<p>總之，一切偉大人物，無論是發明家。科學家。思想家·事業家等等，其偉大能力的表現，大率在靑年時代。所以偉大人物的偉大成就，在靑年時代，已立定基礎。我們知道偉大人物爲社會進步最重要的基本原素，所以靑年實爲社會進步的原動力。（未完）</p>

<p>頌詞「總理閣下、本使奉中華民國國民政府主席之命令、為駐德意志國特命全權大使、今日親以國書恭呈貴總理、實覺不勝榮幸、前任劉崇傑公使之辭任國書、亦由本使一併賚呈、劉前使駐剳貴國、備承優待、本使謹代表本國政府致謝、本使對於德意志民族堅忍奮鬥、戰勝環境之精神、及在政治經濟科學工業各方面之成就、素深欽佩、此决得以本國第一任大使資格、親蒞貴國、與貴國人士週旋、引為生平快事、貴我兩國邦交、素稱融洽、近年來兩國之經濟及文化關係、允日趨密切、雙方使節之昇格、卽可為彼此睦誼之瞪明、今後本使自當盡忠職務、促進兩國友好關係、深知於奉行此項重大使命之時、必能得貴總理及貴國政府之贊助也、謹以誠懇之意、祝貴總理政躬康泰、貴國國運昌盛、」頌詞畢、大使親呈國書、德元首接受後、轉交外交部長、卽致答詞如下、</p>
<p>答　　大使閣卜、余今能自大使手中親受貴國國民政府主席通知特任閣下為全權大使之書函、深覺榮幸、同時余接受閣下前任劉崇傑公使之辭任國書、余對於劉公使促進中德間政治經濟文化關係之種種努力、成績卓著、亦謹表示感佩之意、閣下對於德國民族及其各方面之成就、表示贊許，使吾人深為欣慰、德國對於中德兩國間、向來存在的友好關係之維持與增進、至為重視、此决雙方以外交代表、昇格為大使、卽為此種意願之象徵、足以表示聯繫貴我雨國之友誼、閣下為中華民國第一任駐德大使、並以促進與擴展兩國閭之種種友好關係為閣下高尙之義務、使余聞之、深為欣慰、並敢告閣下德國政府及余將時常予閣下以充分之贊助、承大使對德國及余個人表示種種友誼的祝福、甚為感謝、並對閣下表示同樣之意願、謹以德國名義、向大使閣下表示誠摯之歡迎、」</p>
<p>禮畢入坐、略事寒暄、德總理問候林主席蔣院長起居、殊和靄親切、是時館員等尙靜候接待室、德元首乃起立入接待室、大使隨之、館員向德元首行一鞠躬禮、當由大使分別介紹、一一握手、德元首率隨從退出、館員復一鞠躬、司禮人員以禮杖尖端擊地作聲、表示禮成、一時卅分程大使率館員離總統府、仍坐前乘汽車、由參事及交際司秘書陪同返館、</p>
<p>查各國外交使節覲見元首之儀式、各有不同、而德國定例頗為簡單、其制公使覲見與大使覲見禮略同、惟公使無迎送之禮、公使須乘坐自備汽車、並不得帶館員入覲、如有特別情形時、可帶隨員一人陪往、總統府衛兵舉槍為禮、惟不擊鼓、此其不同之點、</p>
<p>是日柏林出版之晚報、及廿八日柏林及外城各種日報、皆登載長篇之記事及覲見照片、且有幾處大報登載大使之履歷及對大使贊頌之詞、而德國各界對於吾國首任大使之覲見、皆表示極端之重視也、</p>

<p>亂點鴛鴦　互存殺念</p>
<p>某日、王化一因有事赴津、以乃妾王淑靜、性情放蕩、囑張樹林監視其行動、未意張又與王淑靜發生曖昧、柳王氏聞知、醋性時發、但無可如何、及王返平、乃吿以張樹林與王淑靜之秘密、王怒甚、憤語柳王氏云、遲早必殺張樹林以雪恥、及柳王氏與張親暱時、復以王語吿張、囑其小心、張亦謂、先下手為强、余當先殺王化一、此語柳王氏亦傳諸王化一耳中、致主僕之間、互存相殺之念、</p>
<p>捨王就張　主僕水火</p>
<p>年前、王化一欲辭退張樹林、事為柳王氏所聞、因鍾情於張、先行自動辭職、寄居於阜城門內十八半截胡同四號富華居粥鋪內（鋪掌王克達、係柳王氏之娘家族弟）、後院內房、前月產一子、（迄今甫兩月）、而王化一對柳王氏仍未能忘情、曾命其姪王俊華、前往送信、囑柳王氏另找房、作為外家、但柳未置理、且以其所生之子、為張樹林所出、王化一因是益恨張樹林、</p>
<p>生前戲謔　竟成語讖</p>
<p>本年廢曆正月初一日張樹林找柳王氏同居兩天、至初三日吃餃子後、張謂擬先赴賈團長公館、然後往王處長處看看、柳王氏卽謂、勿再往王處長公館去、因王處長正在打算害你、張笑謂、我去如眞不回頭、你可找賈團長去、請為報仇、兩人尙以為戲謔、均未介意、翌朝、張卽出門、果一去未返、柳王氏心中納悶、渠本識字、旋見報載東車站箱屍案之屍格、與張樹林相似、連夜神志不寗、遂赴四根柏賈公館探詢、至則適王淑靜在座、據王淑靜稱、張樹林因偸竊財物、業已潛逃、另由賈公館人以電話向王宅詢問、則謂張剛才出去、繼派人前往探視、宅中人又稱、張已有兩三日未歸、但發現張之被褥、為車夫蔡永祥使用、</p>
<p>設計殺僕　分是屍裝箱</p>
<p>上述情形、旋為偵緝隊中人所聞、當由偵緝四小隊先將柳王氏傳訉、繼傳捕李亮經。王淑靜。王俊華·蔡永祥·田永祥·張金福·等七名、研訉結果、得悉當張樹林於廢正初四日去王宅時、宅中人卽謂老爺正找你、有一封信、趕快送到東四　樓轎子胡同三十一號、（該房係王化一之產、現係空房、張樹林持信步行前往、而王化一是時卽與廚役李亮經。及李之友人奚桑園、將乘汽車先往、及張叩門、李為開啟、張行至北上房台階時、李卽出八音手槍、向張後腦擊去、張應聲倒地、悉桑　急用　勒張之頭、李更用刀先斷張頭、决及兩臂、又决及兩腿、奚更由隆福寺購到箱子兩隻、分裝張屍、以便相機運棄、</p>
<p>正兇就擒　唆犯在逃</p>
<p>時正天氣寒冷、張屍肢解後、雖裝箱數日、尙未腐爛、經唆使人王化一縝密計慮結果、用電話向南池子興記汽車行。及京津汽車行、各呌汽車一輛、將箱運至東車站、擬運往天津遺棄、李奚二人、王各賞洋二十元為酬、兩箱運至車站、因重量超過定額、王化一卽乘樓棄箱脫逃、轟動一時之箱屍案、因而發生、偵緝四小隊、根據各人供述、始將正兇李亮經在保定附近捕獲、唆使王化一。曁帮兇奚桑園在逃、除仍繼續緝捕外、二十二日下午二時、該隊已將人犯男女七名口、一併解往偵緝總隊鞠訉、前曾傳稱王化一卽前遼寗敎育會長王化一云云、證明完全不確、（二十二日）</p>

<p>— （嚴懋德）</p>
<p>要知道，在一瞬之間，現在就會變成過去的，將來就會變成現在的。但人們活的年齡是有量的，而那時光是無限止的：我們在很短的存在期內，須緊抓住現實幹去！不要天天期待者明天！</p>
<p>慾望原無北境，生活貴有節制；在可能範圍之內，求相當慾望的滿足，固然合理。可是從事希冀不可能的過度奢求，則終身為慾望的奴隸；活潑的心靈永陷於不能滿足的苦悶深淵之中，再無超身自拔的時日了。</p>
<p>失敗是什麽？菲列浦說：「沒有別的，失敗只是走上較高的一步階石。」許多成功的人，都是受賜於屢决的失敗。沒有失敗，恐怕不會得到大勝利。而堅强的人們，失敗反足以增加他的决心，勇氣，而使他成功。</p>
<h3 id="c229">法國公園的初春 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>枯楊的枝頭，正在用力地放出嫩綠的新芽來。松針，柏葉，冬靑，雖說耐寒，但在微微含有濕意的春風飄過時，似乎也在微微地喘過着氣來，把一切葉兒，都轉成了姣艷的靑色了。池塘邊的小草兒，也都丟了灰黄的被蓋，把小嫩頭兒，鑽出地面來，向着楊柳枝兒的嫩芽兒點着首，似乎說道，「哈，你也來了？」靜靜地躺在池塘裏的水兒，也跟着在面上皺成了細緻的水紋，似乎是現着一臉間適而會心的微笑。</p>
<p>這是法國公園的早春，才從嚴寒的冬季中逃出來的早春。枝頭的鳥，在樹梢頭，啁啁啾啾地唱着歌。唱着是甚麽歌，唔，或許是春之戀歌吧。不錯，是春之戀歌。一對一對的靑年男女，手挽着臂，踏着富有節奏的步子，從這一叢中，說着（春的甜蜜的話，充滿着自然的笑，緩緩地轉進了別一叢去了。孤獨者的眸子裏，據說是見不到季節的轉換的，他們所能感到，只是被春的氣氛所包圍着而生長出來的煩悶。枝頭的小鳥，被驚得飛起來了，啁啁啾啾的歌聲，他停止了，手挽臂兒的靑年男女，也給驚得止住了脚步了，偶然地由孤獨者長嘯了一聲，——煩悶的呼聲。</p>
<p>西洋小孩子，都換上了鮮艷的外衣，在靑綠色的草茵上玩着，活潑潑地，點綴着初春的生意。「阿媽」們，推着孩車，在草茵上散着步，步子是那麽的緩慢，眼，向週遭間瞧着，間瞧着周遭的春色，間瞧着遊人們的在春風中所特具的愉悅的氣色，盡情地瞧着，偶然的也把不自知的笑意，掛上了嘴角。春的生意，在每一個細胞中，爆裂開來了，——含有濕意的春風，誘惑地吹拂着，吹拂得母一個細胞，都爆裂開來了。</p>
<p>太陽光，還是那麽無力地照射着，但在公園中，已是那麽的富有生意了，雖然各種花兒，還是沒有一些吐蕊的消息。初春的法國公園，眞像是巴黎咖啡座裏的年靑而美麗的女侍。女侍是得在電燈光下欣賞的，法國公園，籠罩在初春的淡黃的太陽光下，似乎更顯得鮮艷而又素凈，値得留戀。</p>

<p>有一年，他的妻子病故了，他料理喪事後，並不感覺悲傷，似乎非常滿意；而且還買了許多禮物，跑到素不來往的丈母娘家裏去，當然要使伊非常驚奇了，伊想：這頑固不近人情的女婿，今天却破例跑到門上來，那倒是値得研究的一回事，因此他解釋着說：「我以前所以不來的原故，就是你還不能算是我的丈母娘，因為你的女兒還在，說不定受了壞人引誘，背脊對着我，那你可是別人的丈母呢！現在你女兒死了，當然從此歸到淸白去，我所以今天來正式認我的丈母娘」。他這些話似乎迂直如癡，可是他對於現時代，却有深刻的觀察力里！</p>
<p>如今，他受失業高潮的打擊，使他變做一個流浪者了，他常在他一些朋友那裏逗留，朋友們也很歡迎他。同時，他還有一個絕技，就是能預知陰晴風雨，絲毫不會錯誤的。據說他現住在虹口，我假使能有機會的話，我一定請我朋友相伴去訪他一决，讓我可見見這個怪石丘。</p>

<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>在南京，提起黑市來，大概沒有不知道的。實在的，南京的黑市，在南京是有很久的歷史了！</p>
<p>黑市的地點，在從前是豐富路二道高井一帶，現在呢？已經改在建鄛路朝天宮宮后山了。他們營業的時問，原來是在夜裏，等到太陽出來以後就收市了。後來，首都警察廳為着防止黑夜的不正當買賣起見，特地呌他們改做「蟯市」，自天明起，到九十點止。所以現在南京的黑市，已經是名不符實。</p>
<p>南京黑市的主要人，大概可以說是挑高籮的，因為南京挑高籮的特別多，他們在白天挑着高籮向住家收買破舊的東西，回去用一番手續，把它整理一下，就帶到黑市去賣，這一轉手，他們就可以得到不少的利益了！</p>
<p>黑市裏的討價還價，都有一種切語，如果懂得這種切語的，才可以買到便宜的東西，吾則，不但討不了便宜，或許反會上當呢！</p>
<p>據一個挑高籮的說：依靠這黑市生活的人，大概有整千的，因為如果沒有黑市的話，首先他們收買的東西，就沒有地方出售了！這的確是實情。</p>
<p>如果沒有事的時候，大可以時常到那裏去走走，或許可以碰到一些奇異的東西，友人王先生，曾以一串錢的代價，買了一方古硯，不過這是可遇而不可求的。</p>

<h3 id="c234">運城花絮 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 明道</p>
<p>山西運城地偏僻而幽世深，鮮稔其名，其地風俗敦厚，土地肥沃，居民多業農，質樸不間外事，誠有如老子所謂郅治之世，隣國相望，鷄犬之聲相聞，老死不相往來者，不啻世外桃源也。有友人來自其處，述常地之風土人情，頗多可噱者，爰拉雜記之如下：</p>
<p>運城交通不便，北至太原，南達潼關，雖有汽車路可通，然途中崎嶇不平，汽車須盤旋山　而上下，駕駛者稍一不愼，即易致粉身碎骨之禍。故一般人視為畏途，寗坐笨重之騾車焉。其地街道殊不整潔，多為泥沙之路，天雨時，泥濘載道，天晴時灰沙撲人，故家家門上均懸有一刷帚，每自街頭歸時。必取帚向身上足下拂拭一過，而後入室也。</p>
<p>四圍駐紮軍隊甚多，顧與民殊親善，絕無騷擾之事。終歲鮮有盜案，幾有夜不閉戶之風。蓋家家節儉無赤貧者，而外方人絕少至共地者也。市上行使，昔日皆為現洋，而無紙幣，今者幣制已更換，則鏘鏘之銀餅殆將絕跡，一般窖藏者流，又不知作何光景也？</p>
<p>運城之敎育雖不十分發達，而亦有中學一所，以及一女子師範，小學校亦有數處，但學生之程度則甚幼稚，而讀書之時間，自朝晨七時起至夜間九時，中間除早晚兩餐而外，都在讀書。學生大都死讀，喃喃然如老嫗誦經，大可哂也。</p>
<p>重男輕女之風尙未改革，故平日婦女都罕與外客交際，街頭絕少蹤跡，為新嫁娘者，終年匿伏閨中，三年不能見外人，否則則斥為無禮。但每年廢歷正月元宵節前後三日，則婦女得一大解放之機會，蓋在十叫十五十六三日，其地必張燈慶祝良宵，所謂火樹銀花，金吾不禁之盛况，在運城尙能得見一二。滿城婦女傾閨而出，紛至街上觀燈，以為樂事，雖深夜不歸，亦放任自由，然一年之中，亦祇有此三日之逍遙耳。而晒小脚之陋俗，亦屬可卑可異之事也。</p>
<p>何謂晒小脚？蓋運城之婦女無不纏足者，猶是十九世紀之女子，天足之幸福不可得，而貼地金蓮，三寸窄窄，反以為榮。每在元宵節邊，日間輒坐於門口，雙雙小脚，伸　　外，曝於日光中，名謂晒小脚。羅　　鞋，鈎心鬥角，一種妬寵爭妍之心理，可笑亦復可憐。　輕薄之男子，徜徉街頭，相與評足以為樂，　　瘦？某也尖，一字之　，榮於華袞，某家婦女之蓮瓣，苟為人所稱譽者，其家人咸　為莫大榮幸也。</p>
<p>元宵節邊，街坊中多跌秋千架，男女老少過此者必置身架上，一宕秋千，以為可以免去一年之災晦。但秋千架甚高，擅此者往來宕搖，飛騰空中，旁觀者輒拍手稱美。曾有一老婦自秋千架上失手而墮，竟殞其生，此非迷信之害乎？</p>
<p>民間之娛樂甚少，新年中忽聞　帝廟中映有電影，友人以為不可失此大好機會，即偕數友租一汽車駛往其地，一賭銀幕盛况，蓋距離甚遠也。不斜所謂電影者，乃在台上蠢一絕大之白幕，幕後張燈，有數人持紙剪之人物，往來搬演，作爭鬥之狀，觀之眞可噴飯。而其地之士女列坐而觀，津津有味，友人不覺為之呼寃，懊　而歸。事後方知此類電影，本用以　神者耳。故稱為影戲而不能名為電形，即此「端，亦可以覘知其地之文化矣。</p>

<p>報單係黃色，字係手寫並無其人，合幷聲明。橫。其上端幷畫有黨國旗交直他榮任「主蓆」，所以义形，頗拙劣。第二行「索性把他的姓名及某省省印」下一字及第三行「合」名都空去了。</p>

<p>（三）敎材和師資人才的缺乏　敎材為實現護士敎育主要之工具，敎材適合與吾，能影響整個護士事業前途的命運，但是我國向無適合之敎材，雖有課本，不是　譯自外洋，未能適應我國社會立塲所需要，就是陳舊不符，弊害百端，我們旣然認為敎材應重視，更不能忽略了主持敎材師資的問題，因為欲普及或改造護士敎育，必依賴師資施行敎學之技能，方可收得實際之效果，但是現在護士學校的師資，大多以醫師或護士兼任授課，他們旣未受過相當師資之訓練，又缺乏實際敎學之技術，加之院中醫務繁重，工作忙碌的原因，不能按時前來授課，護生所得到智識的傳授，護病的技能，在無形中而减低，所以敎材與師資人才的缺乏，誠是推動護士事業前途進展障碍的事。</p>
<p>乙　護士人才種類的分析</p>
<p>掛羊頭賣狗肉的護士　這為中國男護士的通病，甚麽呌做掛羊頭賣狗肉的護士，就是男護士曾受過相當護士職業之訓練，富有着專門護病的技術，而不能向着本位事業努力去發展，發揮本位的技術，而為社會服務，反而離開着本身事業的不幹，掛了醫生的招牌，欺騙民衆，我們推究它的原因，不外乎社會組織的欠缺，使他們生活上不能安定，為着飯碗的問題，肚內的飢餓，因而才挺身走險，幹變態的職業，這個問題，深望護士學校當局有所注意。</p>
<p>以擇偶對象的護士　護士職業在每個的心目中，差不多公認為女子專門的職業，事實吿知我們是很簡單，女子有溫和的性情，纎細的心靈，使其事必勝其任，護士職業旣然為女子所操縱特有之技能，在這五十年的過程內，為何很少見年高之女護士，服務於社會，造福及社會，這是不是使人發生疑問之疑問了。追求其原因，她們根本未能明瞭人生的眞諦，職業服務的眞義，並不將本身事業為終身的職業，永遠為着人類去服務，一旦尋得理想的夫婿，再因着家庭生活的安閒樂逸，服務職業的意志，無形而萌退遂離開她的職業，如是之循環不息，生生不已，中國年老女護士渺少的這個問題，很明顯地已經給我們正確答覆了，所以這就是以擇偶對象的護士，但希望女護士同志們平心靜氣地想一想而鼓勵未來吧，</p>
<p>抱着悲觀的護士　什麽呌做抱着悲觀的護士，他們不但不能信任中國護土前途有希望有光明的，而且將中國護士界已經認為整個是滅亡了，奮鬥吧，也是不能使社會認識護士職業的重要，不如無聲無息地求到腹內飽，反而覺得安閒快樂自在，這我們當然無辯駁的可能，因中國社會的事實擺在我們的面前，但是可以回答的是，中國護士前途是極對有希望的，只要整個護士界人們，站在一條陣綫上，努力奮鬥起來，大衆有一分力量去推動一分力量，也許說不定能使中國的大衆會有一天認識我護士職業的偉大。</p>
<p>失敗觀念的護士　他們雖然不絕對悲觀，至今還能承認護士前途勝利的存在，但却沒有深刻的自信心，因為他們曾經為護士界大聲急呼的奮鬥過，以謀護士前途的勝利，結果社會使他們是失望和灰心，他們遂認為中國社會一日之不能改良，護士職業永遠沒有出路，這點我們可以表示的，他們正應再接再厲，奮起熱烈之情緒，勇敢之精神，堅决之意志，堅持到底，來征服社會環境，而展開我中華偉大之護士事業。</p>
<p>綜上護士職業一般之觀察和人才之分析明示我們，中國護士界雖然有五十餘年的歷史，還未曾脫離黑暗的路途一步，今後護士事業之改革，我們將由何處着手去，為我們努力中心之目標，有人說是護士敎育為改革之急先鋒，我們也不能吾認它，不過護士行政之獨立，是為達到護士敎育的手段，必然之過程，發展護士事業基本之組織，由此觀之，護士行政為解决護士事業先决之問題，今後努力中心之目標，深願吾全中國護士同志們，以共同之意志，合作之精神，力爭護士行政獨立起來，主權完整起來，而展開我中華護士光榮之途徑來。</p>

<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>白喉一症，為慘虐疾病之一，急性傳染病中最危急者也。近歡年來，以交通日趨便利，白喉疫勢益為猖厥；卽衛生設備較為完美之先進各國，白喉之罹病率，晚近尙有逐漸上昇之趨向；惡性白喉患者，亦較往昔增多；稽諸專家之統計，皆屬信而有徵。我國地處溫熱兩帶，衛生事業，又甚幼稚，患者之衆，死亡之多，經濟損失之鉅，雖未獲睹精確之統計報吿，然亦殊易想像度之。嗟乎！耳所聞，目所見，吾民苦於斯疾者多矣。</p>
<p>溯自一八九零年德人貝靈氏發明白喉血淸療法後，根據歐美之統計，其死亡率雖較昔時低下三分之一，但日本學者之報吿，死亡率猶超百分之二十以上；是治療之效果，尙未達吾人理想之境界，此無他，治療有遲早，而患者體質强弱有別也。惟近年本症於美國，則逐年减少，是則為努力預防之效果，故提倡預防，以策萬全，實謀公共衛生者首要之事。</p>
<p>本症預防方法不一，所謂普通預防方法者，健康之人，須與本症患者絕對隔離，患者之各種排泄物，不可任意放置，應以預貯有消毒藥品之器接受之。又與之接觸之器具，衣服等，均可有病菌附着，為傳染之媒介，必須十分消毒。要之，一發現本病患者，最妥送入傳染病隔離病院，吾則應擇一室居之，俾不與多人接近，雖然，凡此言之非艱，行之維艱；一則吾國傳染病隔離醫院，所在寡有，二則民衆醫藥常識極為缺乏之故。至於以白喉血淸皮下注射卽所謂被動性免疫方法，被人採用已久，雖能獲得暫時對白喉之免疫（卽不被傳染之謂，）然其效不過三星期之久，過期後仍有被傳染之虞。且一度施行本法後，於再注血淸時，有引起過敏現象之慮，故其適用，祗限於急需預防之時，如看護患者之人，醫師，同胞，父母，家人等之預防，或學校，寄宿舍等集團生活，有爆發流行時用之，就其功效言，不得謂之全無缺憾</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>然則各國結核死亡率之减少，其價値果何如乎，此種問題，　不能嚴格的一概而論，因結核在各國各地各種不同之民族，以及不同之年齡，直不能加以同一的比較也。</p>
<p>結核症之傳染，在各地各有其時間性及侵襲性之不同，目因文化之各異，在某一種族，其傳染則較速或較慢，有時或較早及較遲。</p>
<p>以結核侵襲世界之眼光而觀察，據Biraud氏之意見，當先注意歐洲各國北美合衆加拿大澳洲及紐西蘭與日本諸城，因在以上各地，可便利診斷，而早期可檢出其結核原因。此外結核死亡例之不變化者或反行增加者，如中美與南美諸國，印度馬拉羣島，法蘭西，及中國是。由默洲侵染及於菲洲之結核症，多蔓延於菲洲之中部，而法屬之北菲及南菲，結核雖曾一度侵襲，但現已减退。</p>
<p>在最近之一世紀中，（Rossele氏）挪威保持結核死亡例之最低數。在一九一〇年，則以丹麥為最低。在一九二〇年則以荷蘭之死亡例較之挪威為尤低。在戰後則瑞士英國瑞典及德國之統計，其死亡例均行减低。以最近之觀察，則德國較之其他各國之結核死亡例更為遞减，為全歐及全球結核死亡例最少之國家。以英國Greenwood及Wolff氏之研究，以為結核死亡例，在工業國家本屬甚低，但在工業國家中之工業區域中，則其死亡例較之其他區域為高。</p>
<p>在結核之减少問題一書中Dann氏以為醫學之改良，與柯赫氏LobertKoch之發明，具同一重要性，務使結核之傳染性，在世界間使其十分明瞭而知預防。</p>
<p>加拿大之結核統計，非常增高，其原因或由於本症認識之廣，多在印地亞。加拿大之死亡例，較之其他民族多出七倍又半，其死亡之年齡，為十歲至十四歲之間。</p>
<p>在英屬之澳洲，結核傳染之年齡甚遲，Hone氏在一病院中，發現在十三齡左右之兒童，有陽性必而開氏反應Pirquet者僅為十八，二％。</p>
<p>結核在印度之情形，比較惡劣，其死亡例非常之高，每年每一萬人民中，的有三十一例之結核死亡者。其傳染之經過，大都由於城市間嚴重之病者，每送往鄉間治療，因是而廣布傳染。公共衛生及一般狀况，非常不良。治療所及養病地，非常缺乏。更因無國家組織之防癆機關，故防癆之工作，當然無從成功。且天氣惡劣，結核菌易於滋生。結核症之經過，因對於結核傳染之缺少免疫性，多為急性及嚴重性，且多屬於混合傳染性者，患者非常之多。惟腺結核骨節結核及關節結核之經過，在印度較為安全。</p>
<p>在意大利，因城市間居戶之稠密，缺少廣塲與花圜，工作室大多過於狹小，均為結核症傳布之大原因，而成為民間最多之疾患。如司加定諸國及荷籣，每年人民之死亡數，不及全國病院之床數。在英美德諸國，則死亡數及病床數幾相同。在法國則每一個病床數，有二個之死亡數。在意大利則每個病床數，有五個之死亡數。在Sardinien地方，不僅公共衛生情形非常不良，且有多數瘧疾症，惡劣之街道，灰塵飛揚，而陷於治療困難之情形。故意大利結核死亡數，自一九二五年始行减少，直至一九三〇年為止，肺結核之統計，已减少三二％，其他結核，則减少一五％。實施防癆工作者，為法西斯主義之政府，在一九二七年，實施結核强迫保險，成續極佳。意大利婦女之在五歲至十九歲之間者，其死亡率非常之高。</p>

<p>小學之程度者，莫不知種牛痘可以預防天花發生。種牛痘之安全，與夫其可免感染天花之效力，可謂耳熟能詳矣。吾所欲述之白喉自動性免疫方法，亦猶是也。惜乎提倡乏人，民鮮洞悉。在歐美已成過去陳跡之事，於我國每視為新奇之發現，此固不獨醫藥常識為然，悲夫！吾誠不知何年何月，白喉自動性免疫方法之知識，一如今日為預防天花而種牛痘之能廣播於民衆腦海也</p>
<p>白喉自動性免疫方法，數經歐美學者殫精竭盧，耗去若干之努力，方告厥成。其所用之藥劑，曰無毒液（Antitoxin），其製造方法，於本文無叙述之必要。惟使用後，將來萬一需注射任何血淸時，無起過敏現象之慮。預防白喉發生之力量，亦較優良，副作用輕微，實為白喉預防方法上，造一劃期之進步，值得吾人之提倡者也。</p>
<p>此種藥劑，應用時須行皮下注射，可於任何時行之。在統計上，一歲至七歲之小兒，患白喉者最多，故當先就此等年齡施行。較為合理想者，生後九月至十二月之小兒，卽為之施行此種預防注射，而以在春季為佳；蓋一歲後之小兒，罹病率甚高，本病又為冬季寒冷時期所流行，在春季行預防注射使之得發生充分之免疫力，藉免罹病於白喉多發之冬季。且也，據學者之研究，謂注射後，需經過三至六個月，免疫力方獲形成，故注射允宜從早。</p>
<p>此種預防方法，已由學者證明，功效確實，免疫時間長，注射雖經四年以上，猶保存其效力，亦有謂終生可免疫者。惟有少數被注射之人，於注射之部分，感覺疼痛，輕度發紅，但三數月後卽可消失，別無其他副作用發生，較之種牛痘之苦痛，並不加甚，但注射必需二次耳。</p>
<p>夫白喉血淸治療之功效，不容吾人吾認；然語有之「上醫治末病，」旣病而藥，斯策之下矣。矧血淸之應用，以其具有副作用關係，非毫無可顧慮者。君等當已知白喉之凶險及傳染力之迅速，必希冀獲一安全簡易有效之預防方法，謀個人之健康，增家庭之幸福，斯則除注意普通方法外，施行無毒液之預防注射為尙矣，願竭誠推荐之。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>眼病中有所謂白內障者。乃因水晶體發生混濁而起。混濁部的顏色。是一種灰白色。所以特稱之為白內障。水晶體的位置。是在虹彩與玻璃體的中間。牠的形狀。很像一面凸出的鏡子。前面是和虹彩與前房互相聯結。前面的中央。稱為前極。後面是和玻璃體互相聯結。後面的中央。稱為後極。前後兩面相接的部分。則又稱為赤道部。水晶體對於光線屈折上。亦占重要的部位。並具調節作用。水晶體在初生兒的時期。本為無色透明。若至年長。則變稍帶黃色。若至老年。則更變為黃褐色。但是水晶體如何可以發生混濁而成白內障？。這是因有種種原因的關係。茲將牠的原因。略述如左。</p>
<p>先天性的原因　先天性白內障是由水晶體的發育障碍而起或在胎生時期中，有了眼病而續發。又在全身的疾患，或營養障碍的時候。亦可發生。並且常有遺傳的關係。</p>
<p>年齡的原因　白內障發於四五十歲左右的老年人最多。眼科學上，稱為老人性白內障。臨診上最易遇見的白內障。也是這一種老人性白內障最多。牠的眞正原因。現在尙未明瞭。祗可認為是一種老人性的變化而已。</p>
<p>全身病的原因　在糖尿病的經過中。水晶體常能發生混濁。是謂糖尿病性白內障。</p>
<p>併發症的原因　在虹彩炎，毛樣體炎，玻璃體混濁，及綠內障等時。水晶體常由發生營養障碍而起混濁是謂併發症性白內障。</p>
<p>外傷性的原因　當異物的竄入，手術的損傷，以及切創，刺傷，銃傷等等穿孔性外傷的時候。水晶體囊常可破裂。以致房水得由創口侵入水晶體內而成混濁。是謂外傷性白內障。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八節　手術的治療</p>
<p>患者經過人工手術後，如果係發生效果了，關於病灶本身變化之如何情形，當然須藉聽診打透診和X光手續的，方足以明其究竟的。但在臨床的一方面，則可見欬血停止，痰量减少，結核菌不見於痰中，熱度下降，血液沉降，反應漸决遲緩，體重增加，等情；這都是進步的特徵！患者人人都可明白的！允以體溫正常體重增加兩最顯明為象現之認識。這種種進步，大槪歷時愈久，收效愈大：所以人工氣胸一手術，並非以一二决為止境，係應該長期行使的。尋常大概以三月六月或一年為一期，有時也可繼續三四年之久的：但如經施手術後，而病者無上述良好之經過時，則屬諸例外。</p>
<p>人工氣胸對於本病所樹立之成績，已見上面所述，但是讀者們要曉得，人工氣胸並不是一種輕易手術，如果一不小心，刺針刺破肺靜脈，則馬上會引起空氣拴塞一症的。這是最危險合併症之一，患者會立刻卽陷於死亡的，並且是沒有什麼急救方法的。此外像氣腫，滲出液，也是很習見的，尤以滲出液在手術後最易發生，差不多佔百分之五十光景，如果液量過多，更有發生膿胸之趨向，結果仍陷於不治的。所以人工氣胸手術之施行，第一須選擇有經騐的醫者，第二須在X光透視以下方可施行。因為刺針的目的地，須擇胸膜二葉尙未癒着處，吾則卽為錯誤，這一層决不是聽診打診手續所可完全確定的。至於手術之如何施行，器械之如何裝置，X光透視之如何注意，以及每回注入空氣之量等種種；這都是專家應有的知識，一般病者並用不着如此詳悉的，所以本編也一概從略了！</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一二三問）　牙刷用後應該怎樣放置？</p>
<p>答　刷牙後應該把牙刷洗凈，最好用滾水洗過，洗後用力排去水份，掛在一淸潔少塵灰之處，讓牠吹乾，夏日為避蚊蠅起見，可設法遮罩，但不可放在密不通風的小匣內，阻礙水份的蒸發。</p>
<p>（第一二四問）　新牙刷可以馬上應用嗎？</p>
<p>答　市上所售的牙刷，多未經嚴密消毒，毛頭上有時會附着炭疽桿菌，有發生討厭的傳染病的危險，為愼重起見，應該把買來的新牙刷，每日用水煮一刻鐘，煮過二三次，方可應用，至少限度，也須用開水泡過</p>
<p>（第一二五問）　刷牙時不能刷去的食屑，應該用什麽方法除去？</p>
<p>答　嵌在牙縫中間的食屑，牙刷不能刷去時，可用牙簽剔去，還有一個方法，就是用絲綫壓入牙縫，上下移動，除去中間食屑。</p>
<p>（第一二六問）　使用牙簽時有幾點應該注意的</p>
<p>答　牙簽使用不得法，是害多益少的，下列四點應該注意：　不可用金屬製的東西，或其他硬質的牙簽剔牙。　　牙簽須選柔性稍有彈力的木製的，而且須經過消毒磨光的。　　使用牙簽時，不可傷及牙肉，尋常人的習慣，多用力過猛，勉强揷入牙縫，非至牙肉出血不止。　　不可養成咬嚼牙簽的習慣，免得口內軟組織，因牙簽的緊壓，或木屑的刺激而受傷。</p>

<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>在「德國反對闢非武裝區」，「法財長籌措軍費，眾院以空前多數通過短期借欵」，「對於未來戰爭之警戒，美艦舉行大演習」，「蘇俄向璦琿配置有力部隊」，「新任關東軍司令植田發表就任重要聲明書」等等大標題之外，我們又看到一條哭笑不得的新聞，那是「丙子息災法會昨開發起人會」。</p>
<p>所謂「丙子息災法會」，那是本市的所謂「名流們發起的，據主席報吿組織「丙子息災法會」的宗旨說：「今年為國際局勢最緊張之一年，故各國預言家，有發生第二次大戰可能之警告，證之最近國際局勢，又不期然而緊張，俯視國內，則更有萬方多難之感，不發宏願，安望息災？此本會發起之宗旨。希望在座諸人，同發願力，庶弭患於無形，將來法會，由蒙藏大法師榮增堪布，及持松大師，二人主持」云云。</p>
<p>此外，還規定理事九十五人至一百四十五人，常務理事三十九人至四十七人。</p>
<p>丙子息災法會要這麼多的理事幹什麼用？愧非「名流」，無從答復。但是據九十五人至一百四十五人這一點猜測起來，則這一個「息災法會」規模甚大，似乎已可以看出些端倪出來了。</p>
<p>說起規模甚大，我們終不由得不連帶想起，「時輸金剛法會」來，「時輸金剛法會」舉行時，好像除了「息災」之外，是還有什麼「國運」之類乎的「宏願」的，「宏願」到現在怎樣了呢？依舊得「不發安願，究望息災」，並且「國運」之類乎的那些「宏願」是自動撤銷了。</p>
<p>「時輸金剛剛剛法會」之後，什麼「息災」，「求雨」之類的法會是有過很不少的，就是那二位將要「主持丙子息災法會」的「蒙藏大法師」，好像也「主持」過不少决數。雖然因非「名流」，每次「法會」的「發起人」中都榜上無名，所以無從計算起有過多少「功德」，但是那二位蒙藏大法師」的確「主持」過好幾决「法會」，則是確確實賞記得的。</p>
<p>其次，自然就得講一些歷次「法會」以來的功積，耍講到功績，說起來話太長，最好的辦法，我想還是請讀者去買一份中國地圖來瞧瞧，有年鑑或是有舊報紙積存着的，那自然更好，因為這樣你可以更請楚。</p>
<p>在人家「非武裝區」，「籌措軍費」，「艦隊大演習」鬧得一片價響的的的時候，丙子息災法會不知將做出一些什麼功績來讓我們看看？</p>

<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>村里的人給驚駭迷醉了，因為離開他們不遠的墓地上，發生了一件可驚的奇聞，那是在一天細雨濛濛的晚上發牛的。身受者哨兵潘德勝，第二早便滿面血跡，跛着一隻腳到劉團總的公館里去报吿。</p>
<p>「這事情情情是這樣發生的，啊，團總先生……」哨兵惴惴不安的說道「天下着雨，墓地一絲星光也沒有，陰沉沉的，而一隻夜鳴鳥便躲在一株古松上呌着。……」</p>
<p>劉團總，剛從半朦矓的睡態里醒轉過來，靠在一隻繡花的大靠枕上，看着他這個不幸的哨兵，不耐煩地皺着眉：為什麼連面上的血跡也不洗去呢？德勝微微地有點慌張，不斷地用他底髒袖口去揩額角，而其實他并不感到熱悶。於是又——</p>
<p>「……照着平常的習慣，團總先生，老天在上我是從來不撒謊的，我照着一般善良的兵士習慣，掮着槍，胸膛挺起，在那兒跑來跑去，監巡着這條通過墓地而到洛陽的大路。一會是夜嗚烏哀哀的呌着，一會又是雨滴敲打在樹梢上沙沙的響聲；雖然是兀突得那麼可怕，但是我并不因此而稍稍驚慌一下，眞的，團總先生，我并不害怕，……（他吃力地吞下了一口涎沬）</p>
<p>「可是，雨卻越下越大了，我全身被淋濕了一半。於是便躲進那株古松下蹲着。夜鳴鳥永遠是那麼悽悽的嗚呌，雨滴永遠又是那麼單調的響着；但是我沒有怕」，眞的團總先生，我是在抽煙。</p>
<p>「這樣過着，好些時間，也許是二十分鐘，也許是半點，我記不淸，總之是過了好些時間。忽然從墓地里吹來了一陣狂風，呼呼的在黑暗中嘯着。接着我便看見那件奇異的景像：一把吐着靑色火焰的火光，在遠遠的，在那為黑暗罩着的墓地。團總先生，你也許不相信：我并沒有怕，只是稍為震動一下，便托起我底槍幹。我對自己低低的命令道：「預備」！但是那把火光卻就走動起來了，這麼疾速地走着。在光焰下我似乎還看見有一大羣蓬頭散髮的陰影在蠕蠕的動着。（團總先生這時大為震驚，他那有修養的白晰的面孔由紅暈慢慢的變成慘白了。）到這時，（哨兵的髒污的嘴唇，也顫慄起來了）團總先生你也許不相信的，我還沒怕，我把我底槍桿抓的更緊了。他們可仍在那兒蠕動着，蠕動着，越把我追的近。為着職務的關係，我大聲向他們呌道：「口令」？他們沒有回應，只是略略的住了一會，又尖長的嘯號着，好像是回答我似的。於是我生氣了，對自己暗暗的下着命令道：「放」！槍口便砰的噴着煙，但這對於他們一點兒的影響也沒有。他們在蠕動着。……</p>
<p>「終於他們到達我底面前了，是一羣滿身長着黑毛，兩眼燜光，赤裸的人們。他們把我包圍起來，用火焰攻打我。在這樣悄境，就說是神仙，我相信，團總先生，也不免稍吃驚嚇。而我卻揮着刺刀和槍桿和他們撲打。入們或者要問：為什麼要跟他們搏打呢？為什麼不偷偷溜走呢？那我便要回答道：為職務啊，先生！</p>
<p>「接下就是在第二早的事，我是癱倒在一堆墓口（這事實有人以後向團總證明）槍桿不見了。……至於在昨天晚上跟這些妖魔打了好久，怎樣被打倒的，現在卻一些也記不淸楚了。……</p>
<p>團總，是一個信鬼的人，他常說自已聽見鬼呌，他相信在這樣死屍雲疊的墓地，鬼魂的作祟是免不了常有的。但是鬼魂要槍桿幹什麼呢？於是，他打了一個呵欠，用手一揮，德勝便踏出公館去了。</p>
<p>午後德勝在離村的有五里左右的一家小茶館里，和一個陌生男子在一個僻靜的角落里坐着，默默的啜着茶。陌生男子正舉着盃放到嘴唇上輕輕的啜着，一會又慢慢的放下：「那你？……」</p>
<p>「當然咯，我馬上就離開。老朋友，你想我得了那封信後是多麼的不安靜！爸媽辛辛苦苦的生我一身，卻落得自己在家里受大水，挨寒餓，你想做見子的在外面做事還能安心？唉！……」德勝低低的答着，眼淚幾乎滴下。</p>
<p>「團部里會不會追究？」那陌生人不</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>安的問着，又向他看了一眼。</p>
<p>一追究個烏，橫堅團總是相信了，這兩天我再呌弟兄們撒了個謊，溜他媽媽的。」</p>
<p>那陌生人點了點頭，又從盃子里啜了最後的一口茶，站起來，會了鈔，和德勝一起出去了。在集角的一個僻靜地，他悄悄的遞給德勝三張十元的鈔票，又低聲的說道：「并不是我不夠朋友，實在也只值了這些！」</p>
<p>他們互相拉了拉手便分開了。</p>
<p>這事過後的一星期，德勝又被派着到墓地去放哨。可是第二天除了一灘血跡和從他身上撕下碎爛的灰衣條外，便什麼也沒有。這故事直到現在還被人們惴惴不安的談論着。</p>

<p>—小麻五，就你會搗包，到新站六十里，提點勁呵！小伕頭打着哈哈。</p>
<p>慢說六十，八十也不放在眼里，不過有一樣，雄皇寺得多歇會，讓咱好好地呼上幾盆，提起腳來管保快如飛。</p>
<p>麻五笑，伕頭笑，其餘的人也笑，「多呼幾口」深深地打入了每個人的心底，有一個共同的企念。</p>
<p>二十五里，在公路上走起來是不算什麼事的，這樣，我們和雄皇寺接觸了</p>
<p>途程上，來往的客商是不難碰頭的，然而，在這里，那簡直是個奇蹟，當我們這一夥烽煙遮沒了雄皇寺，想不到在那里面，正有另外的一股烽煙，預備衝出了那愁悶的重圍。他們，也有幾十名伕子，也有幾個伕頭，貨色似乎不在這一批以下。看，那幾位嬌滴滴的女孩兒，　着粗糙的米粒，簡陋的菜蔬，怔忡着，本來，她們又怎能想到美滿的家庭以外還有這一幕呢？</p>
<p>伕子們鬼混着，去了，三三兩兩的，都抱着同一的希求。</p>
<p>這回，老鐵換了一下裝束，把竹笠的大帽子栓在背上，用塊布包緊了頭，在額上還擰了個蝴蝶的結，遠遠地，像十足的英雄漢子。不對，一遍，兩遍，前面的一行人馬跟隨着老鐵走了，結果，麻五，毛頭，還有一個不知呌什麼的卻失去了下落。帶刺的鐵棒敲着伕頭的腦袋，他急，他跳腳，然而那是沒有用的。</p>
<p>—這些龜兒喲，教老子看見不打個半死！小伕頭發下了誓願。</p>
<p>時間逼追着，不容許有長久的留連，這責任的肩負者當然是無可推諉的，小伕頭臨時抓了個短工把花籃　肩起來，六十以外的老張頭，那雨簍比較輕些的籘包是套到了他的頭上。</p>
<p>伕頭，也不是容易做的，要能拉人，要能鎭服着人們聽憑差遣，在行里要學出師，須接受種種的氣。現在，雖說在待遇方面比較好了點，可是，這大點年紀，老張瞧一下自己的鬍子，如果伕子脫逃的時候，自己還要挑起了這重的擔子呵！說着，他嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>沉默了一會，後來，還是小伕頭打開僵局—</p>
<p>—對待他們不得用好心腸，晚上，他們一定也住新站，到那里找個明白。</p>
<p>担子在老張的肩膀上麼着，背脊在冒着汗珠，直淌下去，左臂搖幌着！</p>
<p>前面靑草花喲……像其他的伕子一樣，他也期誦了慣用的術語，在登山的路上。</p>
<h3 id="c247">旅伴 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>從木扎克　起程，出了石嘛塔，便是這片無邊無際的大沙漠，起碼要趕上八十幾里路，才到庫倫。</p>
<p>這兒沒有什麼山，水，在一片沙漢上，祇有基斯夫和他的旅伴—駱駝—</p>
<p>——陰霾的天色，四顧沒有人煙，旅人和牲蓄，趕路啊——</p>
<p>沙啦啦——迎面掠過一陣巨風，黑屯屯土　般大的一塊沙土，就落在面前</p>
<p>駱駝兒也年邁了，往常牠不怕這些，今年特別遇到了暴風和有漠浪的天，簡直有些害怕，趕不上了！　蹄陷在沙裏，彷彿生了根似的，　不起來。</p>
<p>「老蓄！行糧帶飽了的，怎麼趕不上？哼！一年不如」年……！」基斯失有些怒了，恨猙猙地咒駡着。</p>
<p>可是這頭牲畜不理會他。</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>天空更黯慘了，漠浪的起伏、連接週又作響了。連基斯夫有些担起心來…</p>
<p>「這會怕那頭畜牲栽倒了！」</p>
<p>他望望天，噓唏了一聲，嘴唇邊冲出一道熱氣來，直透過頭頂，在那隻皮耳罩上，漸漸凝成水點，彷彿要滴下來的神氣。</p>
<p>冷，不是今天第一天冷，嘿！咱基斯夫好算從小就長生在這塊沙漠上，不知過了多少年月。</p>
<p>他忖忖過去的歷史，卻爽然自豪起來，於是，二條生命繼續地趕路……；</p>
<p>沙啦啦——捲起一層沙土，幸喜還慢了一步，險些兒把身子葬進了，可是基斯夫的眼睛裹已着了不少細沙，他摒住一口氣，腳步索興停留下來，放下了手裹那包乾糧和鞭子，把頭俯倒了，右手只顧剝去左手的袖套，極純熟的伸起手指拭了一會眼皮，隨後又加緊腳步，搶過了駱駝的前，拉住繩子，緩緩的行走。</p>
<p>暴風仍在呼嘯着，漠浪更起伏得利害了，那頭不中用的老牲畜，牠喘息着，有些不堪前進了，於是身子一軟，便把前蹄倒了下來，望着基斯夫，昂昂頭，食囊裹咕嚕不停的倒出了好些糧食，牠上　對下顎打着歪斜，又像是隨意底在咀嚼。</p>
<p>舐息了一會，還不趕路，基斯夫彷彿等不耐煩了。</p>
<p>「老畜！起……」</p>
<p>想舉起鞭子擊，看看牠背上駝着一袋袋笨重的物件，勉強走着不平穩的步子，好似有些不忍心的自動軟化了。</p>
<p>噢！可不去難為牠啦！早個十頭八年，牠多少得力，替我掙了不少錢，上决部落裹為了防禦敵兵，曾借牠去助過輜重工作的，吶！不要蔑視了牠，牠也上過火綫的，從前方回來，沒有一個不說牠好，能整天小息地趕，不過三年吧！牠沒用了，這會要是再上前綫，怕不會再如前那樣掙氣了，說不定就送在　　兵的掌握裏，不，我不讓牠去……不……不……」</p>
<p>基斯夫仁慈了，推起一臉的和氣，他對那老旅伴卻表起同情來，一壁搖着頭喃喃地默語，把手裏的繩子放鬆些，又整整貨物和行裝。</p>
<p>陰霾的天色，永不開朗，四顧沒有人煙，旅人和牲畜，趕路啊………</p>
<p>沙啦啦——暴風仍在呼嘯着，沙漠上留着一條好似長蛇般地綿互不斷的足跡，送走了二個漠中的旅人………</p>

<p>珊君—一個少年的寡婦，她的丈夫是一個幹革命工作者，可是現已經死了！不過卻替她留下了不少錢，因此她很安樂舒適的在上海過生活！</p>
<p>她丈夫的朋友白教授，現在是每天必到她家裹來跟牠講話，講的什麼呢？每天都是叫她「……珊君，你飛吧！你向新生的地盤開拓下去吧！」這當然他是在拚命的追求着珊君，但是珊君一點兒也打不動她的心。</p>
<p>忽然，雜誌編輯兼書賈的章盛昌的太太，會跑到這裏，向珊君商量，叫她可憐伊已有了三個孩子，不要去愛伊的丈夫盛昌，道時候珊君又好氣，又好笑，眞的莫明其妙，因為她並沒有愛過章盛昌，根本絕對不會去愛上章盛昌的，等她吿訴樂章太太，章太太才放心的回去了！</p>
<p>白教授她也不愛，章盛昌絕對不會愛上，那不珊君倒底愛上了誰呢？吿訴你吧！她是愛上了樓上的小說家湯化時。</p>
<p>湯化時是一個寫一毛半錢一千字的小說家，可憐他在文壇上一個人也不認識，只認識了一個章盛昌，因為他剛從日本回來，可是你要知道章盛昌是一個吃人精，吸人血的惡魔，一毛半一千字的文稿，當然湯化時得來的稿贊，別說吃飯了連吃香煙的錢還不夠哩！</p>
<p>終於在湯化時寫到他最後一篇文稿「我們該怎樣地死去，」還沒有作完。他已經服的毒藥發作而死了！</p>
<p>珊君呢？她同情的人，愛上了的人的血現在是被吸完了！</p>

<p>當「萬古流芳」The　Story　of　Louis　Pafteu　攝製的時候，在該片主角保羅茂尼家裏的寢室內，突然多了一樣傢具，乃就是一把老式的理髪椅子。這位影星，他並不是拿那椅子當作睡具，他是拿來在化裝時候用的，因爲本來的巴爾茂尼並不像片中的人物巴士德，他的頭髪較短，面部較瘦，並且沒有鬍子，所以每天早晨，他至少要耗費兩個鐘頭的光陰去化裝，變成了一個和眞的巴士德一般無二的巴士德，然後才動身到攝影場上去工作，這部片子內容，是詳叙科學界的大偉人，全人類的功臣魯易巴士德的一生，他不怕君王的震怒和一般大人先生們的冷嘲熱諷，大膽地去戳穿那生和死的一重帷幕，向那看不見的人類公敵宣戰，爲着巴黎女人的幸福，爲着全世人類的幸福，他拚命去和那些無形殺人惡魔抗戰着，這些壞東西，那時已經從巴黎的溝渠中漸漸的侵害到鮮花般美麗的法國女人身上來了，片子聽說已經檢查通吿，不久就要在大光明公映。</p>

<p>Taiyuan: The town of Shuitou in the Shi County, a base of operations for the Communist bandits after they infiltrated Shanxi Province, had extremely fortified defenses built on hilltops. Important agencies of the puppet Soviet government were all located there. After continuous siege by our First and Fourth Columns, it was completely recovered by noon on the 22nd, striking directly at the bandit stronghold. According to a telegram from Sun Chu, Shuitou was recovered on the afternoon of the 22nd, and battles were extremely fierce in the southwest. In another telegram, Yang Chengyuan reported that the Liu and Liang Brigades under his command engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits near Shikou on the 22nd. After dusk, the bandits scattered into mountain depressions and crevices, and our troops are still searching and suppressing them. The town of Sanjiao in Zhongyang County was recovered by our troops yesterday, and all ferries were immediately blocked to cut off the bandits' escape route. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: After the bandit troops entered Shanxi, they occupied the town of Shuitou in the Shi County and built strong fortifications. According to a recent telegram from Sun Chu, our Ma Yan, Shou Zhenwu, and Chen Changjie Brigades captured Shuitou town on the afternoon of the 22nd, with intense fighting in the southwest of Shuitou. Furthermore, a telegram from Yang Chengyuan at dusk on the 22nd stated that our Liu and Liang Brigades engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits near Shikou. After dusk, the bandits scattered into various mountain depressions and crevices. The Liu and Liang Brigades are still gradually searching and suppressing them. The bandits' base has been lost, and their arrogance has been greatly diminished, marking the largest and most disastrous defeat since the bandits invaded Shanxi. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: The Red bandits entrenched in Sanjiao Town, part of Zhongyang County, were attacked by our brigade in swift daily operations. The bandit nest was broken through, and Sanjiao was recovered on the 18th, with many bandits killed. Furthermore, after the Chen Brigade recovered Nuanquan, they took advantage of the victory to attack Shatang Town, northwest of Nuanquan. The bandits could not resist and fled in disarray. Currently, all ferry crossings along the river from south of Sanjiao to west of Peitang have been sealed off by our brigade. In the battle of Guanshang Village, the remaining bandits who had fled and hid in the mountains were also completely annihilated by us. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Baoding: Song Zheyuan has halted his southern tour and may return to Peiping on the 27th. Qin Dechun will return first by special train at 6:00 PM on the 23rd. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Peiping: This morning in Baoding, Zhu Zheyuan inspected the provincial guard regiment and the Public Security Bureau's security team, and gave a speech. He also summoned and spoke to the third and fourth groups of county magistrates this morning, with 63 magistrates attending. The Belgian envoy, Ji Youmu, arrived in Peiping from Nanjing this morning. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Tai Dechun left Peiping for Baoding this morning. According to reports, this trip to Baoding was made upon Song Zheyuan's telegram summons. He will stay in Baoding for several days, and may return to Peiping with Song. Tai brought with him 100,000 copies each of the following propaganda materials: 1. A proclamation to the people, 2. A proclamation to the students, 3. A proclamation to the teachers, 4. A proclamation to the officials. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: A telegram from Baoding reports that Qin Dechun arrived in Baoding this morning. After getting off the train, he immediately went to the headquarters to meet with Song Zheyuan. It is rumored that after Qin's meeting with Song, he plans to travel west for inspection and is scheduled to return to Peiping on the 26th. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Qin Dechun is scheduled to return to Peiping from Baoding tonight. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Baoding: The interviews with the third and fourth groups of county magistrates from Hebei and Chahar proceeded as scheduled on the 23rd, both in the morning and afternoon. Song Zheyuan gave a speech at 8:00 AM, followed by an inspection of the provincial and county public security teams at 10:00 AM, which concluded at 12:00 noon. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Baoding: Song Zheyuan met with reporters at the provincial government at 3:30 PM on the 23rd, stating that his planned tour to inspect the people's livelihood would be postponed due to time constraints, and he plans to return to Peiping on the 27th. The bandits in Jinan have been largely suppressed, and the local militias are being reorganized. The voluntary Baojia system will continue to be implemented. Hebei's annual fiscal revenue is over 14 million, while expenditures exceed 19 million, creating a significant deficit. Since increasing revenue is not feasible, the only option is to focus on reducing expenses to alleviate the burden on the people. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Peiping: Qin Dechun is returning to Peiping from Baoding by special train at midnight tonight, accompanied by Liu Yifei. Xiao Zhenying and others will be at the station to welcome them.

<p>Nanjing: After listening to the reports from various Japanese consuls-general in China in Shanghai, Japanese Ambassador Arita, accompanied by his secretary Kondo and clerk Ogihara, left Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 23rd on a special train attached to the Shanghai-Peiping railway. He arrived in Nanjing at 10:50 PM that night. Arita did not disembark. Many staff members from the Japanese embassy and consulates in Nanjing went to the station to board the train and meet with him. Arita briefly spoke with those present on the train before proceeding across the Yangtze River to Tianjin, where he will meet with Tada and listen to reports from Japanese consuls stationed throughout North China. After that, he will return to Japan. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese newspaper "Nichinichi Shimbun" today published a dispatch from Shanghai, predicting that Japan's policy toward China will change and become more assertive. It is said that the recent meetings between Ambassador Arita and President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang Qun revealed that the basic differences between China and Japan remain. Adjusting Sino-Japanese relations is extremely difficult. China cannot accommodate Japan's opinions and still harbors doubts about Japan's Far East policy. Furthermore, the Chinese people oppose the Hirota Three Principles. This sentiment has swayed Chinese leaders. Key figures in Nanjing did not pay much attention to Arita's explanations. It seems inappropriate for Japan to continue negotiations with China. For this reason, Arita will change his policy toward China after taking office as Foreign Minister. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Despite Implementation of Anti-Smuggling Measures, Smuggling in Tianjin Remains Rampant; Ronin Use Cars to Carry Goods and Refuse Inspection <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: Since the implementation of the new anti-smuggling measures in North China, regular merchants of foreign goods have been complying with regulations and reporting for inspection. However, smugglers continue to use various methods to bypass the Tianjin East General Station checkpoint. Cars arrive in an endless stream, coordinating their efforts. Customs is devising thorough countermeasures. Along the Jinpu Railway, each station is responsible for anti-smuggling, and the customs authorities will dispatch their own personnel. Goods departing from the Tianjin East General Station can only be shipped with a customs inspection certificate. In Tianjin, ronin smugglers have been using heavy-duty trucks to transport smuggled goods to Gaoyang and Qingyuan in southern Hebei. The trucks display the flags of the International Transportation Corporation, and armed ronin provide escort. They refuse inspection when passing checkpoints such as the Jinxi Yingmen checkpoint. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Lin Shuyan, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, stated that although anti-smuggling measures have been implemented in North China, there is still no solution for eastern Hebei. This is due to the fundamental problems in eastern Hebei, which are difficult to resolve in the short term. Currently, the railway's assistance in anti-smuggling is only a temporary remedy and not a thorough solution. Therefore, foreign misunderstandings are unavoidable in this case. However, he will do his best to dispel their prejudices. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Jinpu Railway Office, upon receiving orders from the General Bureau, will implement the same anti-smuggling measures as the Beining Railway. In addition to the Tianjin East General Station and the Second Station, all stations along the line are instructed to pay attention at all times. If tax-evading goods are discovered, the Customs will be notified for consultation and handling. According to personnel from the Tianjin Customs Superintendent's Office, although measures for investigating and suppressing smuggled goods have been stipulated, the existence of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei has created numerous obstacles for customs personnel in their anti-smuggling efforts, resulting in limited effectiveness. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: With the Beining and Jinpu Railways assisting customs in anti-smuggling, smugglers have already made other plans. It is rumored that all smuggled goods are transported from Tianjin East and then loaded onto long-distance buses for transport to the interior. Ronin from a certain country escort the buses and refuse inspection at checkpoints along the way. Therefore, smuggled goods are continuously traveling along the Tianjin-Baoding Road these days.

The meeting began at 9:00 AM with music. Chairman Sun Ke led the attendees in paying respects and offering wreaths. He then gave a speech, stating that Mr. Deng Zhongyuan was an advanced member of the Party. When he served as the commander of the First Division of the Guangdong Army and the chief of staff of the General Headquarters, Chen Jiongming was the commander-in-chief. At that time, Chen held all military and political power in Guangdong Province. Chen did not agree with the Premier's plan to establish a revolutionary government and launch the Northern Expedition, and he secretly plotted to obstruct it. Mr. Deng was Chen's subordinate at the time, but he was loyal to the Party and strictly followed the Premier's orders, so he was resented by Chen. When the Premier launched the Northern Expedition from Guilin, Chen began to show signs of instability. He specifically instructed Liao Zhongkai and Deng Zhongyuan to be responsible for finance and military supplies in Guangdong, and to secretly monitor Chen's actions. Therefore, in March of the eleventh year, Chen secretly had someone assassinate Mr. Deng at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, resulting in his martyrdom. It has been fourteen years since then. The strength of Mr. Deng's life was his ability to endure hardship and be loyal to the Party. Therefore, he adhered to the principles of the Party and strictly followed orders, never wavering. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Deng, we should emulate his great spirit and career, fighting and sacrificing for the country to shoulder the important task of revitalizing the nation and saving the country from danger. Only then will we not lose the true meaning of commemorating Martyr Deng. After Sun finished his report, the meeting concluded with music. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

He then explained the meaning of "labor" and "service," stating that Heaven endows people with intelligence and talent to labor and create a continuous life for the universe through labor, promoting the coexistence and co-prosperity of mankind. Therefore, labor is not only for improving personal life, but should be based on the premise of improving the life of the entire nation, so that the purpose of improving life can truly be achieved. He then said that the Premier said that life should aim to serve and not aim to seize. We should always regard this as our guide. Last year, our Party formulated the "Measures for the Work of the Party Members' Labor Service Corps." Now, there are organizations of youth labor service societies in various places. This kind of movement is to revitalize the declining and enable young people to sweep away the sentimental and decadent nature, cultivate the habit of hard work and endurance, sweep away selfish and self-interested ideas, and cultivate a spirit of great justice and selflessness. It is necessary to practice the ancient teaching of "Do not worry about the lack of strength, but worry about its not coming from oneself," and hone oneself and engage in labor. He hopes everyone will encourage each other. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Question of the Railway Line into Sichuan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since Zhang Jiaao, a magnate in the financial world, took charge of railway construction, and the Ministries of Finance and Railways issued 120 million yuan in railway bonds in January of this year, China's railway development has been actively underway, with the southwestern railway network as the focus of construction. Recently, Mr. Zhang personally went to the southwest and made decisions regarding the overall railway network plan. According to Mr. Zhang, personnel have been dispatched to survey the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, and work on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will also begin soon. The Nanchang-Pingxiang Railway has already started construction in January, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway is being planned, and the three sections of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway are nearing completion, with the tracks expected to connect in May and the line to be open to traffic in October. After the Nanchang-Pingxiang Railway is completed, direct traffic between Shanghai and Guangdong will be possible. Therefore, after the opening of traffic between Shanghai and Guangdong next June, Changsha will become the center of China's railway network, and the center of the country will also shift westward due to economic and national defense needs.</p>
<p>If our Chinese nation wants to cultivate a permanent national foundation, carry out unified construction, and be able to cope with the occurrence of extraordinary events, then the completion of the transportation network in the southwestern provinces is the most urgent requirement. Sichuan is the most suitable base for the revival of the nation, so its connection with the southeastern provinces and communication with international seaports are even more important. Some commentators have said that Sichuan is China's "Kamchatka" and Chengdu is China's "Ankara." However, today's Sichuan cannot connect to Hong Kong and Kunming in the south, nor can it connect to Changsha and Wuhan in the west. If we want to retreat to "Kamchatka," what route should we take? If we want to carry out a long-term resistance, how can we communicate with countries around the world to maintain the necessary supplies for long-term resistance? Therefore, the construction of the southwestern railways is important. The completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is crucial, and the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou, Yichang-Guizhou, and Hunan-Guangxi Railways is also an urgent requirement. The railway line connecting Changsha and Chengdu must be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, transportation between Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan relies solely on the Yangtze River waterway. However, the shoals and rapids between Chongqing and Yichang make navigation dangerous. Ships cannot travel at night and even during the day require pilots. The cost of transporting goods is not only expensive due to insurance fees, but the journey is also circuitous and insufficient to meet the needs of extraordinary times. Transportation between Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan is even more difficult, with only narrow mountain paths and no modern means of transportation. If we want Sichuan Province to realize its value, we should open up a route into Sichuan. One plan for this route is to go north from Guiyang, cross the Lou Mountain Range, and reach Chongqing, then connect the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway westward to Chengdu and the Hunan-Guizhou Railway eastward to Changsha. Another plan is to extend the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway through the Three Gorges, along the Yangtze River, and reach Hankou. The former is difficult due to the treacherousness and steepness of the Lou Mountain Range, which makes construction difficult, and the completion of the Hunan-Guizhou line would take too long. The latter is difficult due to the treacherous terrain of the Three Gorges, where mountains pile upon mountains along both banks of the river, making the cost of tunneling and opening mountains exorbitant. According to the estimates of American engineers, the construction of a railway from Yichang to Chengdu would cost more than 200,000 yuan per mile.</p>
<p>It is heard that the railway authorities recently have a plan for the Sichuan-Hunan Railway as the main route into Sichuan. This plan is to extend the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway southward along the Yangtze River to Fuling, then along the Wujiang River to Pengshui. From Pengshui, it would go southeast, cross the mountains and enter Yuanling, Hunan. From Yuanling, it would go through Changde to Changsha. Construction along the Yangtze and Wujiang Rivers is easier, and construction from Yuanling to Changde and from Changde to Changsha is also easier. However, the 400-kilometer section between Pengshui and Yuanling is more difficult. Nevertheless, it is easier compared to the Lou Mountain route and the Wuxia route. Furthermore, if a branch line is built from Neijiang on the Chengdu-Chongqing section to Leshan, and a branch line is built from Changde to Shashi, then the transportation between Sichuan and Hubei and Hunan can avoid the treacherous Wuxia Gorge. Chengdu and Changsha can be directly connected, so that going south can reach Guangzhou through the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and going east can connect Beijing and Shanghai through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Its economic, political, and national defense value is very great.</p>
<p>Now, the Chengdu-Chongqing line is being surveyed, the Guangdong-Hankou line will be completed soon, and traffic between Zhejiang and Jiangxi is expected to open soon. If Chengdu and Chongqing can be connected with Changsha as soon as possible, then it will be easier to advance, retreat, attack, and defend in the event of an international war. Hong Kong and Hanoi can both be used by us. The survival of the nation depends on this. I hope those responsible for railway construction will pay close attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Hitler's Tough Stance: Overturning Unequal Treaties, Like Tombstones Merely for Mourning; Defying International Pressure, Unwilling to Submit; Election Speech Delivered at the Jahrhunderthalle <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Breslau, Germany. Führer Hitler, accompanied by Ribbentrop, the representative of the League of Nations Council, flew from Berlin to this city today. He delivered his sixth election speech at the Jahrhunderthalle. More than 40,000 people attended the speech. Hitler said: "The German nation is now demanding complete autonomy. We will never give in to any idea that attempts to threaten us. The ideas of the Treaty of Versailles are not the cornerstone of a new world order. On the contrary, the past has been buried in the tomb. The Treaty of Versailles is like a tombstone, merely for mourning. When a certain clause, its political spirit, and economic foundation have been abandoned by a certain country, under such circumstances, Germany will naturally respond accordingly and restore its inherent military sovereignty within its national territory."</p>
<p>Hitler spoke about Germany's domestic affairs, saying that the democratic politics pursued by Germany are truly democratic in nature. "Such a political system is based on the support of such an organized force. It can be said that it has never been seen except in Germany. My rule over Germany was not achieved by bayonets, but by relying on a majority party that has never existed in politics. The German people, nurtured by National Socialism, have restored their self-confidence. I am now working diligently to restore Germany's inherent rights and restore its freedom and honor. This does not harm any other nation. In the past three years, we have been working hard to eliminate everything that we could not tolerate in the past and do not want to tolerate in the future. At this moment, it is a turning point in world history. New relationships should be established between nations instead of mutual infighting. Only then can we talk about coexistence."</p>
<p>He emphatically stated regarding the international situation that Germany does not threaten any country and seeks nothing other than restoring its inherent sovereignty. This is not my personal opinion, but the opinion of the entire nation." Hitler did not explicitly mention the current negotiation situation, only saying, "I have explained in simple terms the plan to build a new order in Europe. My purpose is not to express anything to other countries, but to establish twenty-five years of peace for Europe. I believe that other countries' people should also hope that their leaders will strive for peace and not merely make expressions. Whether they share this intention with us or are unwilling to prevent foolish wars between nations and would rather strengthen the military alliance system is something that politicians in various countries should ask their people. The German people agree with the policies we are pursuing and must express this on the 29th of this month (the date of the House of Representatives election)." (The crowd cheered loudly upon hearing this.)</p>
<p>Hitler concluded by saying, "I am a German and I have a deep faith in the honor and future of the people. I will definitely protect the rights of the people so that they can achieve peace that is better than the past." (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Breslau Hitler said in a speech here today, "Germany will never succumb to the external pressure caused by the Rhineland issue. The world must recognize this. Furthermore, the Treaty of Versailles is a sign of human intellectual confusion and a failure of the old world, not the creation of a new situation. Since we have had this treaty, we have suffered others' trampling and pain, so we do not want to inflict pain on others. Up to this day, we have not made any threatening remarks to others or taken any actions to harm others, but we have decided that we will no longer accept such unfair treatment."

<p>London. The League of Nations Council, originally scheduled to hold a public meeting at 4:30 PM today, has been postponed until 4:00 PM tomorrow. There are two reasons for this: 1. Several Council member representatives requested the French delegation to explain the meaning and purpose of the Locarno Four-Power Agreement. French Cabinet Minister Pang Gu replied that it would not be appropriate to explain this agreement until Germany accepts or rejects it. 2. The German government's reply has not yet arrived. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin. Although the German government has not yet replied to the memorandum proposed by the four countries of Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy to resolve the situation caused by the reoccupation of the Rhineland, it is said that Hitler has decided that the document is impossible to accept in its current form. The British Ambassador to Berlin, Sir Phipps, made a last-minute appeal to German Foreign Minister Neurath today, saying that Germany should accept the proposal, and even the deployment of an international police force in the Rhineland would not harm Germany because this measure is purely temporary. It is now expected that Neurath's reply will be of a reserved nature. According to well-informed sources, Hitler's reply to the four-power memorandum is unlikely to be issued before Wednesday. (Reuters Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London. A draft resolution will be submitted at this afternoon's meeting of the League of Nations Council. The resolution will include the agreement reached by the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium on measures to deal with the German reoccupation of the Rhineland. The issues involved in the case are: 1. The dignity of the treaty. 2. Submitting the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for a ruling. 3. General suggestions. The signatories of the Locarno Treaty seem to be also submitting a supplementary declaration regarding the suggestions. London now expects Hitler's reply not to arrive before Tuesday. However, it is uncertain whether Germany will completely reject it or accept it as a basis for negotiation. What can be certain now is that Germany will not accept the four-power memorandum in its current form or allow foreign troops to serve as police in German territory. However, Germany may reissue assurances, stating that it will not take aggressive actions in the Rhineland, and advocate that the scope of the proposed conference to resolve the overall situation in Western Europe should be strictly limited. It is gratifying that General Ribbentrop, the German representative, previously hinted that if the German government rejects the four countries' proposal, he will not return to London. Now there is news that Ribbentrop will come here again in a few days. This time, he will bring Germany's answer. I will definitely not make this trip in vain. (Reuters Dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Paris. The Paris Echo newspaper recently commented on Germany's attitude towards the Locarno Four-Power Agreement, saying, "Although the signatories of the Locarno Treaty have reached an agreement and submitted it to Germany, Germany will undoubtedly delay the time and will not rush to submit a reply. At this moment, Germany's diplomatic policy is waiting for a reaction from British public opinion, because Germany believes that the arrival of a reaction can influence the attitude of the British government and destroy the fragile results that France has painstakingly obtained." The British Ambassador to Germany, Phipps, is currently waiting for Germany to submit a counter-proposal. The intention of this counter-proposal is nothing more than "demanding various benefits to compensate. Generally, Germany will first ask the countries concerned to provide international loans to redeem the Polish Corridor and part of Upper Silesia, which was ceded to Poland after the war, from Poland. It will definitely demand the return of some of Germany's pre-war African colonies." The newspaper then said that the British Colonial Office is currently studying a plan to redistribute raw material sources and African land. Generally, the current situation of the northern African colonies is unlikely to be revised. Those in the list for redistribution will be the land around the equator, and Abyssinia may also be included. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Franco-Soviet Pact and Locarno: The Two Agreements Do Not Conflict; Herriot Explains the Reasons; Germany's Excuse is Refuted <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Lyon. The Radical Socialist Party Committee of this city held a meeting here. Mayor Herriot gave a speech, mentioning Germany's move to abolish the Locarno Treaty, saying that Germany's excuse that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact conflicted with the Locarno Treaty and thus abolished the Locarno Treaty is simply not worth refuting. The reasons are as follows: 1. The League of Nations Council has unanimously passed a resolution condemning Germany's violation of the treaty, so Germany's excuse has been refuted. 2. After France and the Soviet Union signed the Mutual Assistance Pact on May 2nd last year, the former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval immediately consulted the signatories of the Locarno Treaty on whether this new treaty was compatible with the Locarno Treaty. Britain and Italy immediately replied that the two treaties did not conflict. However, Germany sent a letter on May 25th last year, expressing its disagreement, which was explained by France in a reply on June 25th. Afterwards, no further arguments were heard from Germany. 3. Although France has taken this cautious attitude, it still included a clause in the protocol between France and the Soviet Union, stipulating that while France signs the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, it must still abide by the treaty obligations it previously undertook. This layer is very broad (Article 2 of the Protocol states: The signatory countries agree that if the clauses contained in this treaty conflict with the treaty obligations undertaken by one of the signatory countries, then the clauses will not apply). 4. France is willing to submit Germany's objection, that is, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact conflicts with the Locarno Treaty, to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague for a ruling. 5. Not only that, France has also invited Germany to sign the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. This treaty is purely defensive in nature. Herriot concluded by saying that from this point of view, Germany's claim is like saying, "Our country is unwilling to sign the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact with France, but if Germany does not join this pact, then France is also not allowed to sign it." This claim can be said to be self-contradictory. (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London: The Thirteenth Committee of the Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution this morning stating, "The two parties involved have submitted replies to the peace proposals put forward by this committee on March 3rd. We hereby take note of them and entrust Chairman Madariaga, together with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, to contact the parties involved and take appropriate measures so that this committee can, as soon as possible, promote mutual understanding between the parties involved and end the war and restore peace within the framework of the League of Nations and in the spirit of the alliance." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to a special dispatch from our reporter, the Thirteenth Committee of the Council of the League of Nations is finding it very difficult to carry out its work. Italy has not yet submitted a reply on how to handle the agreement established by the Locarno Conference. Although Committee Chairman Madariaga wants to contact representatives from Italy and Ethiopia in the hope of promoting peace negotiations, it is feared that this will be impossible. Because the Italian army has resumed large-scale operations in Ethiopia, Ethiopia insists that the League of Nations must not suspend sanctions against Italy while the brutal acts of the Italian army continue. As for Italy, according to informed sources, it will only agree to accept the agreement established by the Locarno Conference after the League of Nations suspends sanctions. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Fascist Labor Union Congress: Mussolini's Speech: Economic Self-Sufficiency Has Achieved Success, Organizing a Labor Union Parliament to Replace the House of Representatives <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>London: Twenty-two national professional organizations held their first general meeting this morning. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a long speech, divided into three sections. The first section explained Italy's efforts to realize its policy of economic self-sufficiency, acknowledging its achievements in national defense as a result of this policy. The second section explained the National Fascist Party's plan to control the national economy, which will be implemented in the near future. The third section reported that the "Fascist Labor Union Parliament" will be established to replace the existing House of Representatives. The original text of the speech is excerpted below:</p>
<p>The first section stated, "Since the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy, a new era has begun in Italian life. If there is no economic self-sufficiency, then political independence, in other words, diplomatic independence, cannot be maintained. The authorities of other countries are also trying to get rid of foreign constraints, especially those related to national defense. If a policy of economic self-sufficiency cannot be established, then national defense cannot fulfill its function, and national policy can only be subject to encroachment." As far as Italy's national defense is concerned, it has already used the results obtained by the National Academy of Sciences in some parts and can be fairly self-sufficient. Italy's domestic raw materials are not very scarce, and it only lacks a few kinds of raw materials, which is one of the main reasons for Italy's various demands for expanding its colonies."</p>
<p>The second section stated, "The plan set by our party is based on a premise: that is, the country must have a day to go to war. As for when and how the war will happen, we do not know. What we can know is that the wheel of fate is slowly turning. However, the Fascist government has no intention of completely nationalizing economic life, but wants to control it through the professional organization system." First, agriculture is still operated by private individuals, and the Fascist government does not intend to make major changes. Second, foreign trade should be completely nationalized, while domestic trade is still operated by private individuals. Third, regarding the control of finance, the government has established a financial credit supervision office. Fourth, small industries are still owned by private individuals, and basic industries, under the national organization, are of a special nature. A large number of shares in these industries have been purchased by the state, and in the future, various industries related to national defense must no longer work for private individuals.</p>
<p>The third section stated, "The Fascist Labor Union Parliament will be organized and established to replace the existing House of Representatives. The date of its establishment will depend on the development of the East African war and the European situation." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>Merchant ships transport soldiers back and forth 400 times, military organization is precise and complete, and expenses are not small. The House of Representatives Military Committee recently submitted a report on the army budget, which revealed the organization of the Italian-Ethiopian War. It is quite interesting. It is said that the total number of troops sent from Italy to East Africa is seven infantry divisions, one mountain division, and six Blackshirt divisions, totaling 300,000 men. In the country, another seven infantry divisions have been formed so that the main force will not be weakened by the Italian-Ethiopian War. As of February 1 this year, the total number of workers hired in East Africa was 60,000, used to build roads and other industries in order to penetrate the enemy territory. The above numbers do not include native soldiers and workers. Regarding health affairs, there are currently 120 ambulance teams serving on the front lines. The quartermaster department has sent countless food, wine, and various drinks to the front lines. 15,837,000 meters of yellow canvas for military uniforms were used, and 19,389,974 meters of other fabrics were used. The telephone lines laid by the engineering team are 1,892 kilometers long, using 5,501 telephones. 108 radio stations and 799 chemical test rooms were built. The barbed wire used on the front lines weighed 12,497 tons. In terms of transportation, Eritrea and Somaliland currently have 87,000 horses and mules and 11,000 trucks. Italian merchant ships carrying soldiers and military supplies to East Africa travel back and forth 400 times, not including the number of trips to transport military equipment. In short, the organization of this East African war is precise and complete, and can be called the ultimate. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The Army Main Affairs Bureau is organizing the implementation budget and additional budget for the eleventh year. Among them, the implementation budget adopts the original plan submitted to the parliament by the previous cabinet but not approved, with 200 million yuan for the regular part and 55 million yuan for the temporary part, totaling 255 million yuan. The additional budget includes 183.04 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident, 20.04 million yuan for the improvement of armaments, 55 million yuan for the preparation of materials, and 7.58 million yuan for general new projects, totaling 270 million yuan. Therefore, the budget for the eleventh year may not have swelled much, but the army will start from the twelfth year to rush to enrich national defense, realize: enrich firepower equipment, newly establish mechanized equipment corps, expand aviation and air defense equipment, and increase troops. However, the realization of these plans requires huge funds and a long time. According to the army's opinion, the government should carry out reforms in finance, economy, and tax system, stabilize the people's lives, and realize concrete policies that adapt to the times, then it will not be difficult to realize the army's requested budget.

<p>Tokyo: Navy Minister Nagano requested that the government establish a new financial policy due to the sufficient strengthening of maritime national defense and military expansion. This is a decision to deal with the new situation in the era of no treaty after 1937, and the naval arms race was not induced by the Empire. However, the current ratio of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan is the total tonnage within the age of the ship, so Japan has 700,000 tons, the United States has 800,000 tons, and the United Kingdom has 1 million tons. Japan has 350,000 tons of auxiliary ships, the United States has 270,000 tons, and the United Kingdom has 390,000 tons. However, the United States is scheduled to complete the ship construction plan within the treaty-allowed amount in Showa 16, so if the status quo is not maintained, the Empire will be at a significant disadvantage and a major defect will occur. Therefore, at this time, we should vigorously enrich and strengthen the navy, which is the general intention of the navy. (Denchu News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e96">Youth and Society (Part 1) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Society has always given youth many titles, such as "the backbone of society," "the bulwark of the nation," and "the future masters of the country," etc., which shows that society attaches great importance to youth. However, whether youth are truly the backbone of society, the bulwark of the nation, and the future masters of the country depends on whether youth can establish their ambitions and take on the responsibilities of society. If youth can establish their ambitions and take on their responsibilities, then they will be worthy of these titles; otherwise, they will fail to live up to society's expectations of youth.</p>
<p>I will now explain, from a sociological standpoint, the importance of youth's position in society, the responsibilities that youth should bear towards society, and the cultivation that youth should possess. I intend to make youth aware of the importance of their position, the magnitude of their responsibilities, and what preparations they should make to undertake the future endeavors of the nation and society.</p>
<p>The Importance of Youth's Position in Society: The importance of youth's position in society can be observed from three aspects:</p>
<p>First, youth are the most hopeful elements in society. We must know that youth is the most important period of life, and the foundation for all of life's endeavors is laid during this period. The great careers of great individuals all begin in their youth. This is in terms of an individual's life. If we look at it from the perspective of society, all of society's endeavors are waiting for youth to undertake them. It can be said that the entire educational process is precisely to cultivate youth to undertake all of society's endeavors. Therefore, youth are truly the most hopeful people in society. Society's emphasis on youth and its eager expectations of youth are precisely for this reason. We all know that older and middle-aged people have either already undertaken endeavors in society or are currently undertaking endeavors in society; their hopes have either already been realized or are being gradually realized; their achievements have already given society a considerable impression. For example, the great thoughts and great careers of great leaders have already made society admire and respect them. As for ordinary people, who toil all their lives, they have already disappointed society. Only the future endeavors of young people can be said to be "just beginning," giving society endless hope. Liang Qichao once compared the differences in the personalities of the old and the young in his essay "On Young China" to illustrate the greatness of young people's hopes. He said, "The old often think of the past, while the young often think of the future; because they think of the past, they have a lingering heart; because they think of the future, they have a hopeful heart; because they are nostalgic, they are conservative; because they are hopeful, they are enterprising; because they are conservative, they are forever old; because they are enterprising, they are new every day." His description of the elderly may be somewhat exaggerated, but his description of the hopeful and enterprising character of young people seems quite accurate. Confucius said, "The younger generation is to be regarded with awe; how do you know that those who come after will not be as good as we are?" This also says that young people have the greatest hope, so their future achievements are immeasurable. In short, there is no doubt that young people are the most hopeful elements in society.</p>
<p>Second, youth are the linchpin of cultural succession in society. We must know that society is continuous and that the members of society are constantly undergoing metabolism. And young people, in the middle of this metabolism, are the linchpin that connects the past and the future. On the one hand, they inherit all the cultural relics, systems, thoughts, and customs of the past society; on the other hand, they pass on all the modern cultural relics, systems, thoughts, and customs to future generations. The reason why society can continue to evolve depends entirely on this role of connecting the past and the future, and youth are responsible for this role.</p>
<p>Third, youth are the driving force of social progress. Social progress depends on two basic elements: great individuals and excellent culture. The two are also mutually causal. Excellent culture is often invented and created by great individuals, and great individuals are often nurtured and cultivated by excellent culture. But in general, culture is ultimately created by humans, so great individuals are the most important basic element for social progress.</p>
<p>Looking at history, the achievements of all great individuals mostly originate in their youth. We will now examine the situations of the youth of various great individuals (such as great inventors, great scientists, great thinkers, great entrepreneurs, etc.) based on their deeds.</p>
<p>Great inventors' interest in invention mostly begins in their youth. Edison liked to study machines from a young age. His initial inventions of various electrical machines were made when he was only a teenager. He continued to study and continue to invent, and became a great inventor of the world. For example, Westinghouse invented the air brake at the age of only twenty-three. Nobel's invention of dynamite began when he was only twenty-one years old. Bell's invention of the telephone also began at the age of twenty-two; and his invention of the "yingfang jiusu" machine was when he was only fifteen years old. Henry Ford's love of researching machine inventions also began when he was a teenager. In short, the emergence of inventors' inventions may be early or late, but the motivation for their inventions mostly originates in their youth. This shows the importance of the relationship between youth and invention.</p>
<p>Great scientists' interest in scientific research also begins in their youth. Darwin, the founder of evolution, developed an interest in studying biology at the age of sixteen or seventeen. He initially experimented with chemistry with his brother, and then entered the University of Edinburgh at the age of sixteen, where he developed an interest in zoology and made many specimens himself. He made new discoveries of marine animals at the age of seventeen. Since then, his interest has grown stronger, and he eventually became a great scientist. Faraday's interest in studying chemistry began at the age of thirteen or fourteen. As an apprentice in a painting workshop, he liked to study books on chemistry, electricity, and other subjects. In his spare time, he often listened to scientific lectures. After that, he studied hard and eventually became a great scientist. Comte, the founder of sociology, had ideas for social reform at the age of ten, and his ideas progressed further when he followed Saint-Simon at the age of twenty. The outline of his great work "Positive Philosophy" was completed when he was twenty-two years old. Spencer's social thought was already established at the age of twenty. The content of his essay published at the age of twenty-three remained unchanged throughout his life. Adam Smith's great book on economics, "The Wealth of Nations," was initially collected when he was only twenty-one or two years old. In short, the scientific research of great scientists all begins in their youth.</p>
<p>The ideological gestation of great thinkers also takes place in their youth. Let us take a few famous scholars in our country since the Song Dynasty as examples. Zhu Xi, a Neo-Confucian scholar of the Southern Song Dynasty, passed the imperial examination at the age of eighteen and was appointed as the registrar of Tong'an. He immediately selected outstanding children in the county to lecture on the way of sages and sages to cultivate oneself and govern others. From then on, he studied the scriptures extensively, investigated principles, and achieved great Confucian status. Lu Jiuyuan, also known as Lu Xiangshan, was an extraordinary child since childhood. When reading the Four Books, he asked questions. He once said: The affairs within the universe are my own affairs; my own affairs are the affairs of the universe. He also said: The universe is my mind, and my mind is the universe. Since then, he has devoted himself to research and became a great Neo-Confucian scholar of the Southern Song Dynasty, as famous as Zhu Xi. Wang Yangming of the Ming Dynasty, named Shouren, discussed the way of sages with Lou Yi when he was eighteen, and he felt that saints could be learned and attained. It can be seen that great thinkers were extraordinary in their youth.</p>
<p>The beginning of great entrepreneurs' careers also takes place in their youth. Sun Yat-sen took it upon himself to liberate the Chinese nation from a young age. When he was studying at the Guangzhou Boji Medical School, he was only twenty years old, he was engaged in revolutionary movement. The great career of George Washington in the United States also began in his youth. When he began his military life, he was only twenty-two years old. Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor of Germany, was heroic from a young age. When he was studying at the Universities of Göttingen and Berlin, he took it upon himself to restore the nation. Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Cavour, patriots in Italy, were all outstanding young people. Mazzini joined the Carbonari party when he was only ten years old; he organized the "Young Italy Party" when he was only twenty-five years old. Garibaldi joined the Young Party and participated in the patriotic movement when he was only twenty-two or three years old. Cavour exhorted himself to revive the nation from a young age. This is in terms of historical figures. Even in terms of the current national leaders and world professional families in our country, many have shown their great abilities in their youth.</p>
<p>In short, the performance of the great abilities of all great individuals, whether they are inventors, scientists, thinkers, entrepreneurs, etc., is mostly in their youth. Therefore, the great achievements of great individuals are established in their youth. We know that great individuals are the most important basic element for social progress, so youth is the driving force of social progress. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Details of Ambassador Cheng Tianfang's Presentation of Credentials in Germany <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Berlin Correspondence: Dr. Cheng Tianfang, the first Ambassador of the Republic of China to Germany, presented his credentials and met with the German Head of State at 1:00 p.m. on February 27th. At 12:30 p.m. that day, the Director of Protocol of the German Foreign Ministry, the Deputy Director of Protocol, and the Counselor of the Embassy came to greet him. Ambassador Cheng, accompanied by embassy staff Tan Baoduan, Yao Dingchen, Qiu Changkang, and Chen Zehua, all dressed in diplomatic uniforms, proceeded to the German Presidential Palace. The Ambassador and the Director of Protocol rode in the German President's car, which was equipped with the Presidential flag. The remaining embassy staff rode in three cars provided by the German Foreign Ministry. They arrived at the Presidential Palace at 12:45 p.m. A line of guards presented arms and played a march on military drums. The Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Presidential Palace led them into the reception room. At 1:00 p.m. sharp, the Director of Protocol entered to announce the Ambassador's title. They were then led into the auditorium. The Ambassador bowed to the German Premier, who returned the courtesy in the same manner. The Ambassador then delivered the following eulogy:</p>
<p>Eulogy: "Mr. Premier, I, the undersigned, am honored to be appointed as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of China to the German Reich by order of the Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China. Today, I present to Your Excellency the Letter of Credence, and I feel extremely honored. I am also carrying the Letter of Recall of the former Minister Liu Chongjie. I would like to thank you on behalf of the Chinese government for the kind treatment extended to the former Minister Liu during his tenure in your country. I have always admired the spirit of perseverance and struggle of the German people, their triumph over the environment, and their achievements in politics, economy, science, and industry. It is a great pleasure in my life to be able to personally come to your country as the first ambassador of my country and to associate with the people of your country. The relations between our two countries have always been harmonious. In recent years, the economic and cultural relations between the two countries have become increasingly close. The upgrading of diplomatic envoys on both sides can be seen as a demonstration of mutual friendship. In the future, I will certainly perform my duties faithfully and promote the friendly relations between the two countries. I know that in carrying out this important mission, I will be able to obtain the support of Your Excellency the Premier and the government of your country. With sincere intentions, I wish Your Excellency the Premier good health and your country prosperity." After the eulogy, the Ambassador personally presented the Letter of Credence. After the German Head of State accepted it, he handed it over to the Foreign Minister, who then delivered the following reply:</p>
<p>Reply: "Mr. Ambassador, I am deeply honored to be able to personally receive from your hands the letter from the Chairman of the National Government of your country notifying the special appointment of Your Excellency as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador. At the same time, I accept the Letter of Recall of your predecessor, Minister Liu Chongjie. I also express my admiration for the remarkable achievements of Minister Liu in promoting the political, economic, and cultural relations between China and Germany. I am gratified to hear Your Excellency's approval of the German nation and its achievements in various fields. Germany attaches great importance to maintaining and enhancing the friendly relations that have always existed between China and Germany. The decision of both sides to upgrade diplomatic representatives to ambassadors is a symbol of this desire and is sufficient to express the friendship connecting our two countries. I am pleased to hear that Your Excellency, as the first Ambassador of the Republic of China to Germany, has the noble duty of promoting and expanding the various friendly relations between the two countries, and I dare to tell Your Excellency that the German government and I will always give Your Excellency full support. I am very grateful for the Ambassador's expression of friendly wishes to Germany and myself personally, and I express the same wishes to Your Excellency. In the name of Germany, I extend a sincere welcome to Your Excellency the Ambassador."</p>
<p>After the ceremony, they sat down and exchanged pleasantries briefly. The German Premier inquired about the well-being of Chairman Lin and President Chiang, and was very kind and amiable. At this time, the embassy staff were still waiting in the reception room. The German Head of State then stood up and entered the reception room, followed by the Ambassador. The embassy staff bowed to the German Head of State, and the Ambassador introduced them one by one and shook hands with them. The German Head of State and his entourage then withdrew, and the embassy staff bowed again. The protocol officer tapped the ground with the tip of his ceremonial staff to indicate that the ceremony was complete. At 1:30 p.m., Ambassador Cheng led the embassy staff out of the Presidential Palace and returned to the embassy in the same cars, accompanied by the Counselor and the Secretary of the Protocol Department.</p>
<p>The ceremonies for diplomatic envoys of various countries to meet with the Heads of State are different, but the German regulations are relatively simple. The ceremony for a Minister to meet is roughly the same as the ceremony for an Ambassador to meet. However, there is no welcoming ceremony for Ministers. Ministers must ride in their own cars and are not allowed to bring embassy staff to the audience. In special circumstances, one attendant may be brought along. The Presidential Palace guards present arms as a salute, but do not beat drums. This is the difference.</p>
<p>The evening newspapers published in Berlin that day and the various daily newspapers in Berlin and outside the city on the 28th all carried lengthy reports and photos of the audience, and several major newspapers published the Ambassador's resume and words of praise for the Ambassador. All sectors of German society attached great importance to the audience of the first Ambassador of our country.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Beiping East Station Corpse in a Box Case: The Truth Unveiled - A Love Triangle Between Master and Servant - The Culprit Escaped, Awaiting Arrest <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The case of the abandoned corpse in a box at Beiping East Station last month, due to the horrific dismemberment and the elaborate design of the box, caused a sensation in the Tianjin and Beiping areas. Both cities' Chinese and foreign detectives, under orders to solve the case within a deadline, concentrated their efforts to bring the perpetrator to justice as soon as possible. The truth of the case has only recently been clarified, with the perpetrator and the vehicle used to transport the box being found successively. However, Wang, the mastermind behind the murder, has yet to be apprehended. The progress of the investigation and the details of the case are described below.</p>
<p>A Director's Household: A Wife and a Concubine</p>
<p>Zhang Shulin, a Beiping native, twenty-four years old, served as a male servant in the residence of You Chuan, a former regimental commander. Jia, from Jilin, due to financial difficulties, transferred to Wang Huayi's residence as a guard. Wang, originally from Henan, forty-two years old, is currently the director of a military supply depot. His home is located at No. 5 Tongfu Alley, Dengshikou, in this city. His legal wife, Xi, is also from Henan and the same age as Wang. His concubine, Wang Shujing (also known as Huizhen), is thirty-four years old. Before marrying Wang, she was a nurse at Xiehe Hospital, known for her beauty. She married Wang five years ago and has two sons, Ji Hua, five years old, and Shao Hua, four years old. The family lives together harmoniously.</p>
<p>Illicit Relations Between Master and Servant: Eyes Through the Window</p>
<p>Wang's residence consists of two courtyards, front and back. The Zeng family lives in the back courtyard, while Wang lives in the front. His wife, Xi, and the female servant live in the five southern rooms. The three northern rooms are for guests. Wang and his concubine, Wang Shujing, live in the two western ear rooms. The rickshaw puller and male servants live in the gatehouse. Five years ago, Wang Shujing fell ill and was cared for by the female servant, Liu Wang. One day, after delivering ginseng soup, she was lured by Wang into the living room for an illicit affair. Zhang Shulin, the guard, returned from outside with a letter. Finding the living room door locked, he peeked through the window and discovered the secret. Wang, seeing someone spying outside, asked who it was. Zhang Shulin, afraid to speak, retreated to the gatehouse and did not tell anyone.</p>
<p>A Love Triangle: The Servant is Murdered</p>
<p>Later that evening, Zhang negotiated with Liu Wang in the servants' quarters, saying that it was demeaning enough for women to be servants, but to also have affairs with the master was unacceptable. Liu Wang, who had feelings for Zhang, seized the opportunity to ask him not to reveal the secret, saying, "I will treat you the same way I treat the master." The two then became involved. Later, Wang Huayi asked Liu Wang what her husband was doing. Liu Wang replied that he was unemployed. Wang then said that he could have him come to Beiping and find him a job. Soon after, Liu responded to the call and came to Beiping from his hometown of Changping. Wang then sent Zhang Shulin to accompany him to Baoding, giving him secret instructions to shoot and kill Liu Wang's husband along the way. He then forged a letter to Beiping, saying that he had been introduced by Wang to be an adjutant in a certain regiment of a certain division of a certain army, instructing Liu Wang to serve the master with peace of mind. Zhang Shulin then returned to Beiping and made similar claims. Liu Wang believed him and continued to alternate between Wang and Zhang, while Wang Xi and Wang Shujing remained in the dark.</p>
<p>Mismatched Couples: Mutual Intent to Kill</p>
<p>One day, Wang Huayi went to Tianjin on business, instructing Zhang Shulin to monitor his concubine Wang Shujing's actions, as she was known to be promiscuous. Unexpectedly, Zhang became involved with Wang Shujing. Liu Wang, upon hearing this, became jealous but could do nothing. When Wang returned to Beiping, Liu Wang told him about Zhang Shulin and Wang Shujing's secret. Wang was furious and told Liu Wang that he would kill Zhang Shulin sooner or later to avenge himself. When Liu Wang was intimate with Zhang, she relayed Wang's words, telling him to be careful. Zhang also said, "It's better to strike first. I will kill Wang Huayi first." Liu Wang also told Wang Huayi about this, leading to mutual intentions of killing between the master and servant.</p>
<p>Abandoning Wang for Zhang: Master and Servant at Odds</p>
<p>Before the New Year, Wang Huayi wanted to dismiss Zhang Shulin. Liu Wang, upon hearing this, and being in love with Zhang, preemptively resigned and moved to the Fuhua Ju Congee Shop at No. 4 Shiba Banjie Hutong inside Fuchengmen (the shop owner, Wang Keda, is Liu Wang's cousin). She gave birth to a son in the back room last month (only two months old). Wang Huayi, however, could not forget Liu Wang and sent his nephew, Wang Junhua, to deliver a letter, instructing Liu Wang to find another house as a separate residence. But Liu ignored him and claimed that her son was fathered by Zhang Shulin. Wang Huayi became even more resentful of Zhang Shulin.</p>
<p>A Playful Remark: A Prophecy Fulfilled</p>
<p>On the first day of the lunar new year this year, Zhang Shulin stayed with Liu Wang for two days. On the third day, after eating dumplings, Zhang said he was going to visit Commander Jia's residence first, and then visit Director Wang. Liu Wang immediately said, "Don't go to Director Wang's residence again, because Director Wang is planning to harm you." Zhang laughed and said, "If I really don't come back, you can go to Commander Jia and ask him to avenge me." They both thought it was a joke and didn't take it seriously. The next morning, Zhang left and never returned. Liu Wang was puzzled. She could read, and when she saw the corpse description of the corpse in a box case at the East Station in the newspaper, it resembled Zhang Shulin. She was restless all night and went to the Jia residence at Sigenbai to inquire. Wang Shujing was present and said that Zhang Shulin had absconded after stealing property. Someone from the Jia residence then called Wang's residence, who said that Zhang had just left. They then sent someone to investigate, and the people at the residence claimed that Zhang had not returned for two or three days, but they found that Zhang's bedding was being used by the rickshaw puller, Cai Yongxiang.</p>
<p>Plotting to Kill the Servant: Dismembering the Corpse and Packing it in a Box</p>
<p>The above situation was heard by detectives. The detective team first summoned Liu Wang for questioning, followed by Li Liangjing, Wang Shujing, Wang Junhua, Cai Yongxiang, Tian Yongxiang, Zhang Jinfu, and seven others. After questioning, they learned that when Zhang Shulin went to Wang's residence on the fourth day of the lunar new year, the people in the residence said that the master was looking for him and that he had a letter to deliver to No. 31 Jiaolou Alley, Dongsibei (the house is Wang Huayi's property and is currently empty). Zhang Shulin took the letter and walked there, while Wang Huayi, along with the cook Li Liangjing and Li's friend Xi Sangyuan, went ahead by car. When Zhang knocked on the door, Li opened it. As Zhang walked to the steps of the northern upper room, Li took out a pistol and shot Zhang in the back of the head. Zhang fell to the ground. Xi immediately used a rope to strangle Zhang's head, and Li used a knife to cut off Zhang's head, arms, and legs. Xi then bought two boxes from Longfusi and packed Zhang's body parts for disposal at a later time.</p>
<p>The Main Culprit is Apprehended: The Instigator is at Large</p>
<p>As the weather was cold, Zhang's body parts, although packed in boxes for several days, had not yet decomposed. The instigator, Wang Huayi, meticulously planned and called the Xingji Automobile Company in Nanchizi and the Jingjin Automobile Company, each calling for a car to transport the boxes to the East Station for disposal in Tianjin. Li and Xi were each rewarded with twenty yuan. The two boxes were transported to the station, but due to the weight exceeding the limit, Wang Huayi abandoned the boxes and escaped, causing the sensation of the corpse in a box case. The detective team, based on the statements of various individuals, arrested the main culprit Li Liangjing near Baoding. The instigator, Wang Huayi, and the accomplice, Xi Sangyuan, are at large. In addition to continuing the pursuit, the team transferred the seven male and female suspects to the Detective Headquarters for interrogation at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. It was previously reported that Wang Huayi was the former president of the Liaoning Education Association, but this has been proven to be completely inaccurate. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Song Zheyuan Returns to Baoding to Interrogate Hebei-Chahar County Magistrates - After a Four-Five Day Delay in Baoding, He Will Inspect Various Counties in Western and Southern Hebei <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Hebei Provincial Chairman Song Zheyuan has been absent from the province for a long time due to presiding over important military and political affairs and diplomatic matters in the Beiping-Tianjin area. He is now taking advantage of the interrogation of county magistrates and plans to personally inspect the hardships of the people in southern Hebei and deploy military forces to prevent bandits. He returned to Baoding by special train at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Those who came to Baoding with Song included, in addition to Madam Song, Pan Yugui, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, Yang Zhennan, Director of the Chahar Provincial Civil Affairs Department, Zhang Yunrong, Director of the Hebei Security Department, as well as Men Zhizhong, Liu Yufen, and over a hundred secretaries, attendants, and guards. Sixty county magistrates from the Hebei and Chahar provinces who were to be interrogated also came along. Baoding, having received news of Song's return to the province in advance, prepared a grand welcome. Military and political leaders and representatives of the gentry, business, and academic communities, such as Wan Fulin, Feng Zhanhai, Wei Lantian, Zhang Jiyong, Li Jinzao, Wang Jingru, and Jia Yuzhang, a total of over five hundred people, came to the station to welcome him. The station and the city of Baoding were heavily guarded. After Song got off the train, he went directly to the Provincial Government by car. He met with the directors and members of various departments in the Provincial Government to inquire about the situation of the provincial administration. At 6:00 PM, he left the government to return the visit to Wan Fulin and others. At 7:00 PM, he returned to the Provincial Government to discuss important provincial affairs with the directors of various departments. He returned to his residence in Dajinxian Hutong at around 11:00 PM to rest. Starting on the morning of the 22nd, he met with guests from all sides in the Provincial Government and summoned important staff from various departments to give instructions. In the afternoon, he read documents in the Provincial Government. Starting on the 23rd, he interrogated Hebei-Chahar county magistrates in the auditorium of the Baoding Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, stipulating that the interrogations would be held separately from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the morning and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM in the afternoon, with instructions added. It is expected that he will stay in Baoding for four or five days before heading south from Baoding to inspect various counties in western and southern Hebei, with Zhang Yunrong, Director of the Hebei Security Department, and others accompanying him. The places that Song will inspect are the counties in western and southern Hebei, and he may go as far as Handan County. The purpose of this inspection is to learn about the hardships of the people and to inspect the local defense corps in various counties, and then reorganize them, eliminating all the old, weak, and disabled soldiers, so as to effectively protect the local area. As for the military defense against bandits in western Hebei, he also intends to make thorough arrangements at that time. The bandits in southern Hebei are lurking, and if they are not eliminated quickly, they will cause great harm to the local area in the future. Song has decided to personally instruct the county magistrates when he arrives in Renxian and Yaoshan counties, urging them to suppress the bandits and eliminate them. After inspecting the various counties under the jurisdiction of Damingdao in southern Hebei, he will return to the province, manage provincial affairs briefly, and then go to Beiping to preside over military and political affairs in Beiping. Song is very serious about interrogating the county magistrates of Hebei and Chahar. In addition to Song's personal inquiries, Pan Yugui, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, Zhang Jiyong, Director of the Hebei Civil Affairs Department, Yang Zhennan, Director of the Chahar Provincial Civil Affairs Department, as well as Men Zhizhong, Liu Yufen, and others, take turns giving instructions, and the county magistrates record notes for future reference and application. The drafts of these instruction notes will be used as the county magistrates' written examinations, and graders will review them to understand the county magistrates' knowledge and thoughts. Those who are overly inferior will be replaced to avoid delaying local county administration. Pan Yugui came to Baoding specifically to handle this matter. Pan will leave Baoding and return to Beiping after the county magistrate interrogation is completed. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Nanyang Overseas Chinese Li Changan Visits Haicheng for Inspection - Visits Northeast and Haicheng for Ginseng and Velvet Antler Investigation - Consul General Quan Cordially Receives Him and Has Now Returned to Nanyang <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Penang Correspondence: Mr. Li Changan, manager of the Wanbao Ginseng and Velvet Antler Bureau in Penang, has always had a great deal of research on ginseng and velvet antler, and has returned to China for investigation and procurement of large quantities of top-quality sika deer antler for many years. From left to right, the first person is Li Changan. The second person is Consul General Quan Shien. The third person is Deputy Consul.</p>
<p>Attracting the attention of the national ginseng and velvet antler industry, last year during the Double Tenth Festival, the Shanghai Sanjiang Trading Company and Xin Su Liusi publicly commissioned him to go to the Northeast and Haicheng and other places to inspect ginseng and velvet antler. He was guided and assisted by the Consul General of China, Mr. Quan Shien, and Mr. Duan Yongsheng, a staff member who had been stationed in Haicheng for more than 20 years and had a lot of experience, was sent to various places to contact and investigate everything. According to Consul General Quan, who had been in Waibu for several years, Mr. Li was the first Nanyang overseas Chinese businessman to do so. In addition to hosting a banquet, Quan also took a group photo in front of the consulate. At the time of parting, he presented him with the words "Shou Ren Liang Yao" (Good Medicine for Longevity). Mr. Li returned to Penang last year. (March 10)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Restrictions on Entry of Overseas Chinese in Various Parts of British Malaya - More Than 300 Overseas Chinese Blocked in Hong Kong <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands are mostly from southern Fujian. The American-owned Philippines has extremely strict restrictions and no longer allows new arrivals. Although the Dutch-owned territories do not absolutely prohibit entry, the restrictions are extremely harsh. However, British-owned territories originally had no restrictions. In 1929, Nanyang was hit by a recession, and rubber plantations and tin mines successively shut down. Overseas Chinese lost their jobs. Since 1931, restrictions have also been imposed, but not as strict as those in Dutch-owned territories. After 1934, rubber plantations and tin mines in Nanyang gradually resumed operations. At the same time, the construction of the Singapore naval port required Chinese workers, and the number of immigrants gradually increased. Recently, the four ports of Hainan, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen have been limited to 3,000 people per month, with Xiamen accounting for 1,200 people. These 1,200 new passengers are distributed among the British-owned shipping companies, including 400 for Taikoo, 200 for Hetong, 200 for Yaga Company, 200 for Hefuqing's Jinma Wanfushi two ships, 150 for Jardine, and 50 for the Norwegian Haixing Haili two ships. Each shipping company sells new passenger tickets every month according to this quota. However, the various industries in southern Fujian are in recession, and the number of people trying to go abroad to make a living far exceeds 1,200. Shipping companies distribute the tickets within the quota to various inns and ticket agencies. Each ticket costs 61 yuan (third-class steerage). Because the supply and demand are too different, the inns and ticket agencies take advantage of the situation and raise prices, with each ticket rising to 120 yuan, and up to 160 yuan at the highest. Shipping companies, under pressure from public opinion, have limited the price that inns and ticket agencies can sell for to no more than 80 yuan. However, those who are eager to go abroad still often endure the pain and bid high prices to buy tickets. Currently, the publicly sold tickets cost more than 110 yuan, and some are actually sold for 140 to 150 yuan. Some poor passengers who are trying to go abroad have exhausted all their savings and still do not have enough to buy a ticket, so tragedies arise. On March 1, the "Meimei" cargo ship that departed from Hong Kong and arrived in Singapore on the 8th, British government officials strictly inspected the cargo hold because they were searching for smuggled opium. They inadvertently discovered 137 new passengers without permits at the bottom of the third-floor cargo hold (those who obtained tickets within the limit were issued entry permits by the shipping company on behalf of the British government, which is called having a permit). These passengers included 40 to 50 people from Guangdong, 56 from Chaozhou and Shantou, and 37 from Fuzhou. These new passengers were poor and penniless and could not afford a ticket. The inns took the opportunity to make a profit, transporting them to Hong Kong, colluding with people on the cargo ship, treating people as cargo, giving them 10 yuan per person for transportation, and closing them at the bottom of the third-floor cargo hold. After arriving in Singapore and unloading the cargo, they waited for an opportunity to let them ashore one after another. This method has been used for more than just one decision. Some were lucky enough to reach their destination, but many were suffocated to death in the bottom of the cabin, and their bodies were thrown into the sea when they sailed back to Hong Kong, which is also very tragic. Since Singapore discovered that new passengers were being smuggled as cargo, inspections have been strict. More than 300 poor new passengers from Fuzhou and Fuqing have been blocked in Hong Kong.

<p>Songjiang: The Hu Family Pond Doctor Robbed</p>
<p>Hu Zhenhua, a doctor in the Hu Family Pond, Xin Zhuang Town,</p>
<p>At 1:30 AM on the 21st, more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived, speaking with local accents, holding pistols and flashlights. One thief climbed over the wall and entered, opening the main gate to lead the group inside to rob. After obtaining the loot, they split up and went to the home of Hu Desheng, who lived with them, to search and loot, heading east after plundering. The victim checked the lost property and found that Hu Zhenhua lost 110 yuan, three gold rings, and miscellaneous clothing and items worth several hundred yuan. The thief left behind a pistol bullet head. Hu Desheng's family lost 110 yuan in cash, 4 yuan in silver, and relatively few clothing and cloth items. The case has been reported to the Sixth Public Security Sub-station for investigation.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Bandits Discovered in East Taihu</p>
<p>Recently, more than 7,000 bandits suddenly poured into East Taihu from Zhejiang. The Wu County and Wujiang Public Security Bureaus have dispatched teams to strictly guard the key points on the lakeshore. It is now known that 60 bandits with weapons and red cloth wrapped around their arms have been discovered in Dianshan Lake, which has been peaceful for a long time. The Second District of the Waterborne Public Security Bureau has received a telegram from Wujiang County Magistrate Xu asking them to send a team to jointly suppress the bandits. At the same time, the Wu County Public Security Bureau arrested Wang Yinquan and Zhu Buhai, two members of the Big Sword Society who came to Suzhou from Liyang, in the Hongfu Tea House on Wanli Bridge on Damalu Road outside the Gate of Chang. Because the area is in the Jinghu Railway area, they were handed over to the Railway Police Department for questioning.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Two Robberies and Assaults in One Night - Recently, robberies have been frequent in the four rural areas of Wuxi. Yesterday, there were two more robberies in the Fifth and Eighth Districts, and both resulted in injuries to the victims. Details are recorded as follows: At the home of Fang Jinguan, a farmer in Chengtang Village, Fifth District, twelve bandits suddenly arrived the night before, all carrying weapons, and some wearing yellow coats. They broke into the house and robbed a small urn of cash and 16 yuan in paper money. Before leaving, they shot and wounded Fang Jinguan and left with a roar. In the Eighth District, Nan Chuanfang is adjacent to Baqu in Wu County. The night before, five bandit ships suddenly arrived, with more than 20 bandits on board. After landing, they first robbed the home of the farmer Xu Fubao, then robbed the home of his neighbor Xu Genfu, and beat Fubao and Genfu's wife, Chen, causing serious injuries. Before leaving, they fired shots to show their strength. The two families lost more than 100 yuan. Both cases have been reported to the county for injury verification and for requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Industry Appeals for Exemption from Business Tax</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce reported that the human-powered vehicle industry complained that it had been summoned and detained by the Public Security Bureau for failing to pay back taxes demanded by the Business Tax Bureau, and requested relief. It was found that the human-powered vehicle industry in Wuxi has been paying vehicle donations to the local government since the beginning of the business tax, which are calculated by vehicle and are small, but the amount is already large, and it is not convenient to impose additional burdens. Moreover, most of the industry is made up of poor people in the local area, and neighboring counties in Suzhou and Changzhou have not levied this tax. The Wuxi Business Tax Bureau has repeatedly demanded the payment of old debts, and the Public Security Bureau has also arrested and pursued the debts. Such oppression of small businesses and disregard for human rights is difficult to remain silent on. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the county government requesting that the Business Tax and Public Security Bureaus be ordered to stop demanding payment, and that the relevant parties should discuss and coordinate how to reduce the original local monthly donations and how to take into account both the monthly donation and the business tax, and that no further demands should be made until a solution is determined in order to alleviate the burden on small businesses and stabilize the local area.</p>
<p>Changzhou - Bandits Kidnap and Injure People in Yinanyi Township</p>
<p>Bandits Kidnap and Injure People in Yinanyi Township, Changzhou</p>
<p>Gu Fuyou, of Yinanyi Township in the Ninth District of Wujin, has a modest family fortune, which has attracted the attention of bandits. It happened that at about 8:00 PM on the 21st, more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived, armed with box guns and flashlights, and climbed over the wall into the inner room of Gu's house. They tied up and beat the victim, Gu Fuyou, and severely burned him with fire. They then rummaged through boxes and cabinets and looted at will for more than an hour. Gu's eldest son sneaked out and reported to the watch post in Five Lane Village. The watchman rushed to the scene to catch the bandits. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits fired shots and carried their loot away towards Yixing. Before leaving, they kidnapped Gu's 13-year-old second son. The report was later made by the Ninth District Office and the Eighth Public Security Sub-station, and District Chief Xue Youben and Patrol Officer Fang Dingli reported to the county government on the 12th and tried to rescue the hostage.</p>
<p>Mingguang: Agricultural Bank Loans 300,000 Yuan - Wu Jing, the Director-General of the Provincial Cooperative Committee, inspected Chuzhou some time ago. Considering that the county's cooperative organization was sound and the local government provided strong assistance, he telegraphed the head office of the China Farmers' Bank in Hankou to request a loan of 300,000 yuan, specifically for water conservancy and marketing matters. It is now learned that it has been approved and that Mr. Cheng Yongqing has been sent to handle all the formalities.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Disputes Over Exorbitant Interest - Tao Songshan, a resident of Shaobo Town, Yangzhou, used a gold bracelet as collateral to Zhao Xunzhi for 170 yuan in the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic of China. A few days ago, he took the money and interest to redeem the bracelet, but Zhao Xunzhi demanded interest on interest, calculating at an exorbitant rate, demanding 600 yuan before he would return the bracelet. The Tao family believed that even if the five years of interest were calculated at 2%, the principal and interest would only be more than 300 yuan. As they could not agree, Zhao turned Tao Songshan and the broker Sun Zhulin over to the Yangzhou Public Security Bureau, and they were detained in the bureau for two days before being released. Tao Songshan, feeling wronged, has filed a lawsuit with the local court. It is said that Zhao Xunzhi's letter openly demanding 600 yuan from the Tao family has been attached to the petition.</p>
<p>Nantong: British Warships Conduct Shooting Exercises in Tong</p>
<p>Recently, foreign warships have been stationed in the Nantong Wolf Mountain River. On the 21st, a British warship with a red smokestack arrived. It conducted live ammunition shooting exercises outside the Xiaoyang Port. Gunfire and cannon fire continued from morning to noon. The ship was more than ten miles from the shore, and its name is unknown. It sailed to Shanghai in the evening.</p>
<p>Gaoyou: A Monk Cuts Off His Right Hand While Begging for Alms</p>
<p>A monk named Wei Xiu from the Emei Zhaoxian Temple outside the West Gate of Yangzhou came to Gaoyou to beg for alms to repair the temple. After begging for many days, no one donated. Last night, he went to the home of You Shaoqiu, a wealthy household in Xihe Lane in the city, to beg for 500 cash as travel expenses to return to Yangzhou. The You family not only refused, but also said that he was repairing his "Five Viscera Temple" (stomach) and that he should show some sincerity if he was truly cultivating his mind. Unexpectedly, this morning (the 20th) at 7:00 AM, Wei Xiu bought a kitchen knife and went to the front of You's house and slashed his right hand, causing blood to gush out and fainting on the ground. The whole city was shocked, and many people came to watch. Later, a Daoist woman reported to the Tieqiao Old Monk of the Shan Yin Temple outside Beidou, who came and carried him to the Huoxing Temple, and hired a doctor to treat him.</p>
<p>Bengbu: Counterfeit Currency Ring Cracked</p>
<p>After the newly cast copper-nickel alloy subsidiary coins arrived in Bengbu, they circulated on the market and were welcomed by merchants and the public. However, in recent days, many counterfeit metal-quality subsidiary coins suddenly appeared on the market. Citizens were easily deceived, and many suffered losses as a result. The local authorities paid close attention to this. After cracking a counterfeit money trafficking ring in Yuqingli in the First District, the Public Security Bureau received a tip that someone was secretly casting and selling metal-quality counterfeit subsidiary coins in private, using counterfeits to confuse the real coins in order to profit. Under strict investigation by the Public Security Bureau, they cracked the ring at Li Yitong's house in Gaoyingzi yesterday. They found many counterfeit coins, lead blocks, and molds, and sent Li and the evidence to the Public Security Bureau. The interrogation revealed that it was closely related to the counterfeit money manufacturing ring that was cracked the day before. The witnesses were transferred to the court for questioning.</p>

<p>Symptoms Have Lightened and Recovery is Expected in Two or Three Days - Wang Will Go to Nanjing Within a Week After He Has Recovered Somewhat - Mr. Gu Mengyu Visited Yesterday and Had a Long Conversation - Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, was admitted to Hong En Hospital for treatment of a cold after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. His condition improved yesterday, and he will be discharged from the hospital in another two or three days. The President has replied to his telegram with condolences and invited Wang to meet in Nanjing. Gu Mengyu, Secretary-General of the Political Council, visited yesterday. The details are as follows according to the Shen Shi News Agency:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Symptoms Have Lightened, Recovery Expected Soon <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Wang was admitted to Hong En Hospital on Haige Road due to a cold. According to the attending physician, Wang suffered from epidemic catarrh, commonly known as a severe cold. This is Wang's old ailment, and it is prone to recurrence if he exerts himself too much. After careful diagnosis and treatment, he has made rapid progress and his spirits have recovered well. Generally, he is expected to recover after two or three days of rest, but it is not advisable to see too many guests.</p>

<p>After Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai, he learned that Executive Yuan President Chiang Kai-shek had flown to Fenghua, his ancestral home, to sweep the tombs. Therefore, the night before last, he instructed his secretary to draft a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek to report his arrival. After Chiang Kai-shek learned that Wang Jingwei had arrived in Shanghai and had caught a cold, he immediately sent a reply telegram to Wang Jingwei to express his condolences and instructed him to take good care of himself so that he could recover his health as soon as possible. He also confirmed that if his health returned to normal in three or four days, they would meet in Nanjing. Therefore, Wang Jingwei has decided not to go to Fenghua and plans to go to Nanjing within this week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, many friends and relatives of Wang Jingwei in Shanghai visited him at Hong En Hospital, including Xu Weizhen, Guo Yunguan, and Luo Tong. However, because the doctor ordered Wang Jingwei to rest, Wang Jingwei mostly asked the hospital to convey his apologies and reschedule the meetings. Gu Mengyu, the Secretary of the Central Political Council, visited Wang Jingwei at the hospital at about 10 a.m. yesterday to pay his respects. Because Wang Jingwei and Gu Mengyu had been old friends for many years, and he had not had a chance to talk to him in detail before deciding to return to China due to the limited time, he personally received him and discussed the political situation for a long time. Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, also went to the hospital yesterday to express his condolences.</p>

<p>Hu Hanmin's political views remain unchanged; He is determined to come north after the weather warms. Cheng Tiangu, the representative of Hu Hanmin, who came north to discuss all matters, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd by boat with Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. He immediately visited Sun Ke, Xu Chongzhi and other important figures staying in Shanghai to make representations. A reporter from the New News Agency interviewed Cheng Tiangu at his residence yesterday morning. According to Cheng Tiangu, he did not come here with any important mission. Wang Liangchou will represent Mr. Hu to discuss all matters that should be negotiated with the central authorities at any time. He will only assist from the sidelines. Now that Mr. Wang is suffering from a cold and is recuperating in the hospital, and it will take five or six days before he can be discharged. He plans to take the opportunity to visit Hangzhou and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains. Cheng Tiangu continued to talk about the unity between Nanjing and Guangdong, which has already been realized in spirit and there is no problem. As for the results of Mr. Wang Liangchou's discussions with Mr. Hu and others in Guangdong this time, he is not aware of the details. When asked about Hu Hanmin's political views, he replied that Mr. Hu is a loyal follower of the Kuomintang, adhering to the Prime Minister's principles and never wavering. He will implement anything he believes is beneficial to the party and the country with the greatest determination. This is what he knows deeply and can tell. He also said that Mr. Hu's health has improved significantly compared to before, and his blood pressure has dropped by about 20 degrees. However, the doctor ordered that he should not be exposed to the cold, so he can only come north after the weather warms up. As for the rumor that Mr. Hu will travel to Guangxi, it is not true. Because of his health, Mr. Hu cannot endure long journeys. Cheng Tiangu finally said that he has decided to come north, but the length of time he will stay depends on the situation of his negotiations with various parties. He still needs to go south again to see Mr. Wang Liangchou, but he has not yet decided.</p>

<p>Before his departure, Ambassador Arita made a statement to a reporter from the New Sound News at the North Railway Station. The Ambassador spoke English and conducted the following Q&amp;A: (Reporter asked) What are your feelings about your decision to come to China? (Arita replied) I have a very good impression of my decision to come to China. I have been treated kindly by people from all walks of life in China, but I have only stayed for a short time and have not been able to have a good chat. Please publish this in the newspapers to express my gratitude. (Asked) After you return to China, will you be appointed as Foreign Minister and not come to China again? (Answer) My appointment as Foreign Minister is still a rumor. I will always follow the government's intentions, but I still hope to come to China again to resume my post. (Asked) What are the purpose and content of the conference of consuls general that you specifically convened in Shanghai this time? (Answer) Because I have not been in China for long and must return to China, I want to understand the general situation in various places, such as the current situation in the Yangtze River area, so I asked the consuls general to come and report. (Asked) What are your views on Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations? (Answer) I believe that the diplomatic relations between the two countries will continue to improve in the future. The number of votes obtained in one day has exceeded the total number of votes obtained in the previous two days. It can also be seen that this year's foreign taxpayers are enthusiastically submitting their votes. Furthermore, this year's foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession who are eligible to vote total 3,417 people, who can cast 3,587 ballots. Among them, British people account for 1,289 ballots, Japanese people account for 865 votes, Americans account for 405 votes, Russians account for 269 votes, Germans account for 228 votes, French people account for 84 votes, Portuguese people account for 73 votes, Italians account for 56 votes, and the rest are not counted. Today is the second day of the foreign director election, which will continue from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. What the results will be will be reported later. Also, the first day of voting for the new Municipal Council Directors was yesterday, and voting will continue for one day today. The names of the nine elected candidates will be announced in the evening. According to the Municipal Council Director seats, excluding the Chinese, the foreigners are five British, two Americans, and two Japanese. This time, the British community put forward five candidates, and the American community put forward two. If the Japanese community also puts forward two candidates, then no election will be held. However, the Japanese community hopes to occupy one more seat this year, making it three seats. If the Japanese community wins, then one of the British and American candidates will definitely be defeated. Therefore, the British and American community election committees have been campaigning tirelessly for a week to prevent their candidates from being seized by the Japanese. The Japanese community is also doing its best to campaign. Therefore, this election is the most competitive election in the history of the Shanghai Municipal Council. There are two polling stations, one in the Municipal Council Building's Merchant Corps Drill Hall and one in the Hongkou Police Station. Voting started at 9 a.m., and those going to vote were endless in the morning. The prosperity was unprecedented. The Japanese came in groups. By noon today, the number of voters in the polling station in the Municipal Council Building was 700, and the number of voters in the Hongkou Police Station was 280. At lunchtime, after the staff left their offices, the number of voters will definitely be more enthusiastic. After 3 p.m., the ballot boxes will be sent to the office of the Director General of the Municipal Council for sealing and storage.</p>

<p>The Province is Divided into Eight Districts to Ban Excess Cocoon Merchants from Purchasing; Allocated 160,000 Yuan for Improving Mechanical Loans</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee was established in Hangzhou on the 21st, members Shen Huachen, Zhu Jingan, and Chu Huiseng returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the New Sound News met with Shen Huachen and others yesterday and was informed of the proceedings of the control meeting, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">This Year's Opening of the Silk Cocoon Ban <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee, which is now directly under the Provincial Government, in addition to stipulating that the magistrates of the 32 counties should be ex officio members, Chu Huiseng and ten others were hired as members. A meeting was held in Hangzhou on the 21st to establish the committee. Provincial Chairman Huang Shaoxiong and former Finance Director Xu Qingfu attended. Chairman Zeng Yangfu decided on the spot that Zhejiang Province should be divided into eight districts, and a district office should be established in each district. The first step is for the district office to verify the cocoon banks in each district and submit them to the Control Committee for review. The second step is that any silk manufacturer who wants to collect cocoons should first apply for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Banning Non-Silk Manufacturers <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>It is strictly stipulated that non-silk manufacturers may not apply to collect cocoons. The collection of cocoons by excess cocoon merchants is strictly prohibited. If anyone is found to be impersonating a factory, they will be severely punished. At the same time, it is stipulated that the standard for cocoon bank baking is 3.4 yuan per dan, but it should not be lower than 2.4 yuan per dan. Any silk factory merchant who wants to go to various districts in Zhejiang Province to collect cocoons should first register with the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee and will be allowed to freely purchase cocoons after approval.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Loan of 160,000 Yuan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Silk manufacturers in various counties in Zhejiang who want to improve machinery, etc. may apply for a loan from the Sericulture Control Committee, and the Sericulture Control Committee will send technicians to guide the improvement. The Committee stipulates that the total amount of loans for silk factories in Zhejiang Province to improve machinery, etc. in 1936 is 160,000 yuan in national currency. The interest rate is particularly low, at 2% per annum. The purpose is to encourage silk manufacturers to improve machinery, so that the products are exquisite and can compete with foreign silk in the European and American markets.</p>

<p>According to another source, the reporter from the New Sound News learned that the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee initially planned to borrow 30 million yuan from Shanghai-Hangzhou banks to purchase this year's Zhejiang spring cocoons, but later changed it to a loan of 10 million yuan. Now, because Shanghai-Hangzhou banks' supply of caustic soda depends entirely on imports, since the establishment of Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, which uses electrolysis to manufacture acids and alkalis, has given the industrial world a new look. In recent years, mass production has been able to fully supply domestic needs. Recently, with its surplus capacity, after much research and experimentation, a pure hydrochloric acid has been produced, which is so-called chemically pure. This pure hydrochloric acid is divided into two types, specific gravity 1.19 and 1.16, for chemical analysis and medicinal use. The manufacturing process is very cumbersome because it is necessary to remove extremely small amounts of impurities. The pure hydrochloric acid with a specific gravity of 1.19 is called fuming pure hydrochloric acid, and it is even more difficult to manufacture. There are only a handful of factories in the world that manufacture this type of hydrochloric acid, and even the United States does not have this product, so its high value can be seen. Scientific circles in Shanghai, such as the Industrial Chemistry Research Institute and the Shanghai Testing Laboratory established by foreigners, were the first to adopt it and were very satisfied. Special certificates have been issued. The Military Medical Department of the Military Affairs Committee and the National Health Administration have recently purchased a large amount of pure hydrochloric acid for medical use. Other organizations, such as the Construction Committee, the Zhejiang Construction Department, the National Central Research Institute, the Chemical Research Institute, the National Zhejiang University, and the Guizhou Construction Department, have also purchased it successively. The factory's manufacture of this type of pure hydrochloric acid is entirely a scientific contribution and does not take cost into account, so the price is very low.</p>
<p>Money houses, with the recovery of foreign sales of Chinese silk, silk prices have soared, and it is expected that the collection of cocoons this spring will be enthusiastic, so for the loan matter,</p>

<p>The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and committee member Jue Shanxing reported on Mr. Deng's brief history and commemorative significance, briefly stating that today is the 14th anniversary of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan's martyrdom. Mr. Deng had revolutionary ideas since he was a child. At the age of 22, he graduated from the Jiangbian Zhaotang, which was the beginning of his revolutionary actions. One year before the Republic of China, the Wuhan Uprising occurred, and Mr. Deng gathered comrades in Guangdong to respond. After the success, Hu Zhantang was appointed Governor of Guangdong, and Mr. Deng was appointed Director of the Army Department. Later, the Governor's Office was reorganized, and he was appointed Garrison Commander of Qiongya. In addition to training troops, he devoted himself to construction. He soon resigned and went to Japan to assist the Prime Minister in organizing the Chinese Revolutionary Party and planning the campaign against Yuan. When Chen Jiongming rebelled, Mr. Deng was finally taken advantage of by villains. On March 21st of the 11th year, he returned to Guangdong from Hong Kong and was attacked by an assassin at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, being shot twice. He passed away at 5 a.m. on the 23rd, at the age of 38. Today, in commemorating Mr. Deng, there are several points that should be followed by us: We should follow Mr. Deng's spirit of not fearing death and not compromising; We should follow Mr. Deng's spirit of loving the Party and the country; We should follow Mr. Deng's spirit of studying knowledge and skills; We should follow Mr. Deng's spirit of integrity and thrift, etc. Then he shouted slogans and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 14th anniversary of the martyrdom of revolutionary martyr Deng Zhongyuan. In addition to sending representatives to hold memorial meetings, all agencies, organizations, schools, and party departments in the city flew flags at half-mast to mourn. In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to make trouble, the Municipal Security Office and the Public Security Bureau ordered their subordinate security teams, branch offices, police stations, and the detective teams of the Supervisory Office to increase their posts and patrols and to strictly guard against them. The police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession also ordered their respective police stations to increase vigilance. It was stated that the situation of silk factories applying for registration and cocoon collection should be considered before further action, so the process has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Suspension of Work Due to Lack of Raw Materials <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After the recovery of foreign sales of Chinese silk, silk factories in Zhejiang, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places started work one after another. Taking Shanghai as an example, there were more than 30 factories in total. However, due to the lack of raw materials, they successively suspended work. Now, only Baotai Silk Factory in Nanshi and a few other factories are still reeling silk. In addition, there is only one Folun Shuang Gong Silk Factory in Hongkou. It is heard that there are only a thousand dan or so of cocoons in stock in Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Wuxi. It is expected that all of them will be shut down soon, and work will not resume until the spring cocoons come on the market.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government has reduced the bran tax on bran-based goods to 15 cents per dan. The Grain and Oilseed Industry Association and the Oilseed Industry Association, along with transportation companies across the country, have appealed to the central government for a reduction. They threatened strike and work stoppage until a compromise was reached after months of appealing. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry instructed the Guangdong Finance Commissioner's Office to lower the tax to alleviate merchant hardship. The Grain Industry Association of this city received Order No. 75 from the Guangdong Provincial Special Commissioner's Office, which reads: The Grain and Oilseed Industry Association and the Oilseed Industry Association of Shanghai City submitted a document on March 3, 1936, requesting the abolition of the additional tax on domestic bran for the construction of Zhongda (Central) University. The order approved, stating that the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government has ordered that the tax on domestic bran be reduced to 15 cents per dan. Except for special orders, you should comply with this order. The association notified the local industry. The bran tax dispute, which had lasted for half a year, came to an end.</p>

<p>Returning Home Today by Ship Is Purely a Vacation; Rumors of Trautmann's Transfer Are Absolutely Untrue. Dr. Trautmann, the German Ambassador to China, who was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the evening of the 21st, had his trip postponed by one day due to some matter. He arrived in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by his wife and daughter, on the 11:00 PM express train from Beijing. The German Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, and Consul Mr. Bienert, personally went to the North Station to welcome him. After alighting from the train, Ambassador Trautmann immediately transferred to a car and went directly to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, to rest. Today, he and his wife will depart for home on the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Scharnhorst." The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Japan and is docked between buoys number 11 and 12 in the Huangpu River. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 4:00 PM today. Ambassador Trautmann has been in China for many years and has never returned home, so he has decided to make a special trip home. This is purely a vacation and he is scheduled to return to his post in November of this year after an eight-month holiday. There are rumors that Ambassador Trautmann will be ordered to take up a new post and will not return to China, and that Consul-General Kriebel in Shanghai will succeed him as Ambassador. However, according to the "New Voice" reporter's inquiries from semi-official German sources, this is pure speculation and is absolutely untrue.</p>

<p>Feng Rui Sends a Letter to the Federation of Trade Unions' Qian Chengxu, Stating the Importance of Mutual Contact and Market Allocation. The Shanghai Chinese Industrial Federation, in order to promote economic cooperation and production and sales cooperation between Shanghai and Guangdong-Guangxi industries and businesses, has consulted with the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi and organized an inspection group to inspect Guangdong and Guangxi. Yesterday, Feng Rui, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of Guangdong Construction, sent a letter to Qian Chengxu, General Manager of the Chinese Industrial Federation, saying, (omitted above) "Received your letter and understand everything. Your association's inspection group's visit to Guangdong is of great benefit to the province's economy. Our humble hospitality is not worth mentioning. The members of your association's inspection group are mostly pioneers in industry, with plenty of technical experience, and experts in science. Therefore, the provincial government and people from all walks of life welcome them very much. We anticipate that the province's industrial future will receive tremendous help. My personal opinion is that your association should actively contact our province to form a strong economic front. We should carefully study which factories should be set up in Shanghai and which in Guangdong. Those that should be built in Guangdong should not be duplicated in Shanghai, and those that should be built in Shanghai should not be duplicated in Guangdong. This kind of mutual contact and allocation will prevent market imbalances. As for how to achieve financial...</p>

<p>...coordination, we should discuss it in detail. I think that after the inspection group returns to Shanghai, it would be best if you, my brother, could represent your association and come south to Guangdong to discuss this matter seriously. You can first draft a detailed plan and bring it with you. I will do my best to help your association contact the provincial government and find ways to implement it. I hope you can come south as soon as possible so that we can discuss the details." According to Qian Chengxu, the most important point now is that there can be economic cooperation between the ports. Regarding this, the association already clearly stated this at the last meeting of the Guangdong-Guangxi inspection group on March 2. The future situation will depend on the inspection group's return to Shanghai, and concrete measures will be taken to promote economic and production-sales cooperation between Shanghai and Guangdong after deliberation by the members.</p>

<p>Meeting to Be Held in Shanghai on the 30th of This Month.</p>
<p>Representatives from silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces established the Silk Factories Association of the Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in Hangzhou. The purpose is to seek mutual assistance and cooperation among the silk factories in the three provinces in order to promote harmony among the silk factories. It is now known that the association is scheduled to hold its second representative conference in Shanghai on the 30th of this month to discuss the methods for the three provinces to unite and purchase cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the fundraising plan. Silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places are now starting to register the amount of dried cocoons required by silk factories in various places in order to comprehensively plan the purchase methods.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Telephone Company Sends Another Letter to the Taxpayers' Association, Protesting Specific Measures <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Demanding the Abolition of the Limitation on Basic Calls and Advocating a Uniform Rate of Three Cents per Call.</p>
<p>The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee sent another letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Concession yesterday, suggesting measures to protest the telephone rate increase. The original letter reads: "Dear Sirs, We received your letter stating that you have decided to convene a temporary executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month to discuss how to deal with the telephone rate increase, which shows your concern for the public interest. We are very pleased. As the meeting is imminent, we are now listing again the reasons why the company's rate increase is unreasonable, and request that this be raised for discussion at the meeting. Telephone is a public utility with the aim of facilitating the people, and should never be treated as a commercial profit-making entity. Since the Shanghai Telephone Company took over in 1928, the annual surplus has always been hundreds of thousands or more. The company is upgrading equipment to accommodate 200,000 telephones. Currently, only 46,000 telephones are installed in the city. Therefore, the burden of 200,000 telephones is being distributed among 46,000 users, resulting in the current rate increase. We believe that this kind of measure, which is contrary to economics, is tantamount to extorting the city's economy. Once this precedent is set, rates can be increased at any time as the number of users decreases. The company currently charges 6.5 yuan per month for residential telephones, limited to 100 calls, and 10 yuan per month for business telephones, limited to 150 calls. Each additional call is charged at 3 cents. Based on 100 calls for residential telephones, the value of each call is 6.5 cents. Based on 150 calls for business telephones, the value of each call is a little over 6.2 cents. The same telephone equipment is subject to two different charging methods. Since you have already stipulated the charging method for each additional call, we hereby request that your association advocate that the Shanghai Telephone Company's charging method should be uniformly calculated at 3 cents per call, which is fair. If the above objective cannot be achieved, we are willing to sacrifice everything to deal with it. National economy, we urge you to persist and strive..."</p>

<h3 id="e135">The Ratepayers' Association Sends a Letter to the French Municipal Council, Requesting Exemption from Illegal Donations and Licenses <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the French Municipal Council yesterday regarding the forced donation of members of the Second District and Second Branch of the Municipal Federation. The letter reads: "Dear Sirs, Mr. [illegible] of the Dongxinqiao Street Yeziting Shengyi Daxing [illegible] Tea and Food Store on Fada Road, a member of our association, has sent a letter stating that his store has been open for more than ten years. He has already obtained the business donation license from the French Municipal Council in accordance with the regulations. Unexpectedly, investigators from the Hygiene Bureau came for the past two days and said that another hygiene license is required for the internal operations, and that an investigation fee of ten yuan must be paid first." According to regulations, a factory scale must have more than five workers and not be listed in the classification before taxes can be levied. Most of the goods in the store are wholesale from candy companies, and a small number of pastries are made by one or two workers. There is no factory scale, and a classified business has already been donated. Furthermore, there are donation tickets that can be verified. Therefore, we are sending this letter to your council to request immediate negotiations to avoid unnecessary losses for merchants. According to this, since the store's business donation license has already been obtained in accordance with regulations, and the pastry-making factory does not have a factory scale, there is no reason to levy donations according to regulations. In view of the aforementioned circumstances, we hereby request that your council immediately order the Hygiene Bureau to exempt the store from factory donations and taxes in order to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants. Sincerely, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, Shanghai French Concession."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Overseas Chinese Merchants in Batavia Send a Letter Reporting That the Dutch East Indies Offers Preferential Treatment for Imports of Chinese Goods. <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Extra Imports Allowed Without Restrictions; Import Tariffs on National Goods Are the Same as for All Countries.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation received a letter from the Overseas Chinese Importers Association of Batavia, Dutch East Indies, which stated: "Dear Sirs, According to the items discussed at the first regular meeting of the second year of our association on the 6th of this month, after the Dutch East Indies government restricted the import of goods from various countries, the Import Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs gave special preferential treatment to formal import merchants importing Chinese goods, allowing extra imports. However, according to reports in domestic newspapers, there are various difficulties in importing various national goods into the Dutch East Indies, which do not correspond to the facts. The current situation of national goods imports here can be divided into three categories: 1. National goods imported into the Dutch East Indies that have not been restricted can be imported freely (the same as before). 2. National goods that have been listed as restricted can still obtain an extra special import permit in addition to the regular permit (this permit is limited to formal import merchants and those with export evidence). 3. Import tariffs on national goods are the same as for all countries, and there are no exceptions or difficulties. It was decided to send separate letters to various chambers of commerce and factory associations in China to inform them of the import situation of national goods here in order to clarify rumors and benefit national goods. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby inform you for your information in order to correct rumors and benefit national goods. Sincerely, Qiu Yuanrong, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Importers Association of the Dutch East Indies, Zhuang Xiyan, General Affairs."</p>

<p>Sending a Letter to the Municipal Federation Requesting That All Public Organizations Unite to Proceed.</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Executive Committee members of the First Special Zone Citizens' Federation, Ye Jiaxing, Yu Yaoqiu, etc., sent a letter to the Municipal Federation yesterday, requesting that they protest to the two Concession authorities against the obstruction of collecting aviation national salvation donations. The original letter reads: "Dear Sirs, We have read in the newspaper that the political department of the French Concession police summoned representatives of various hotel industries within the Concession on the 11th of this month to discuss the collection of aviation national salvation donations by our government, and ordered them to stop, and even imposed fines. At the same time, similar incidents occurred in the Public Concession. The news has spread and is infuriating. When the collection of aviation donations began in the Concession, the government authorities sent separate letters of assistance in accordance with diplomatic practice and received replies expressing their approval. Since the start of the campaign, due to the people's righteous indignation, they have enthusiastically contributed, and the results have been quite impressive. Unexpectedly, the French Concession authorities dared to obstruct and interfere with the solicitation, confiscate receipts, and impose arbitrary fines. Similar incidents have occurred in the Public Concession. The incident is sudden and the truth is unclear. This not only hinders our people's patriotic movement, but also defies the world and treats our people as slaves. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Therefore, we hereby suggest to your association: 1. Immediately unite all public organizations in the city to hold a representative conference to discuss countermeasures. 2. Submit a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government to lodge a serious protest with the two Concession authorities. 3. Send a letter to the Hotel Industry Association, instructing all members to continue to solicit as usual. If the Concession authorities continue to obstruct, refuse to comply. 4. Before a satisfactory resolution is reached, notify the citizens of the two Special Zones to stop paying taxes. 5. If necessary, make a strong representation to prompt the Concession authorities to reflect. The matter concerns national survival and the people's voluntary patriotic efforts. We urge you to convene a representative conference of all districts as soon as possible to discuss the overall plan and then unite all public organizations in the city to proceed together. Time is of the essence, do not delay."</p>

<p>Five Boatmen Drowned</p>
<p>A certain Fuzhou-bound steamer of a certain Chinese merchant-run shipping company in Shanghai, loaded with goods and passengers from Nantai, Fujian, was entering the port at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. When the steamer reached the Huangpu River near Yangshupu, due to the strong tide and wind, as the steamer was proceeding forward, two cargo barges happened to be coming head-on. The steamer tried to avoid them but was unable to do so, causing the bow of the steamer to violently hit the two barges. They immediately cracked, water entered the barges, and they overturned and sank at the same time. The goods on the two barges also sank into the Huangpu River. The boatmen, including the captain of the barges, who were unable to escape in time, also fell into the river. Fortunately, nearby civilian boats and small boats rushed to the scene to help with the rescue, rescuing some of the boatmen who had fallen into the water. As a result, five people could not be retrieved, presumably swept away by the turbulent water and drowned. The bodies have not yet been recovered. The barge owners are investigating the losses and preparing to negotiate with the shipping company for compensation. The Chinese steamer continued on its way as usual.</p>

<p>Kimens, Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department of the Public Concession, has recently retired and returned home. Kimens has been in Shanghai for many years and has contributed greatly to the security of the city. Now that he has resigned, the Municipal Government, through Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, sent a letter to the Public Concession, requesting that it be conveyed to express the admiration of the Chinese authorities. The original text reads: "I have just received instructions from the Mayor that Mr. Kimens, Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department of the Public Concession, has been in office for many years and is extremely familiar with the situation in Shanghai. He has been diligent and devoted to public service until now. He has also been able to cooperate in good faith and do his best to assist in matters relating to the public security of the city. The Mayor deeply admires him. Now that we hear that Mr. Kimens is resigning and returning home, the Municipal Council should be requested to convey the Mayor's admiration to Mr. Kimens to express our thoughts of farewell." It is said that the Public Concession has also replied with thanks and conveyed the original meaning of the letter to Kimens.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Reopen</p>
<p>After the Ningbo Industrial Bank temporarily suspended accepting settlements, the bank's creditors, together with fellow Ningbo natives, organized the Ningbo Industrial Bank Restoration Preparatory Office to carry out the restoration work. The work has been progressing very smoothly. In accordance with the restoration plan, repayments have been made to depositors, reaching more than 90% of the total debt. However, there are still a small number of depositors whose addresses are unknown or who have moved without notifying, so the office has been unable to contact them. It has recently been learned that the office has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to reopen the bank within a specified time. It has been decided that those depositors who have not yet completed the procedures at the office must do so by the end of this month. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be reported to the Ministry for record. After the bank reopens, these few depositors must still follow the restoration procedures in order to avoid any discrepancies, so that the interests of all creditors can be protected and social finance can be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Aviation Association Orders Trainer Aircraft; One Completed and Test Flight Today <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>At Approximately 4:00 PM at the Longhua Airfield; Piloted by Instructor Xu Chengqi of the Aircraft Office.</p>
<p>The China Aviation Commission, in order to provide flying practice for members of the Flying Club, specially ordered three trainer aircraft from the Aircraft Manufacturing Office of the Ministry of the Navy. The first aircraft has been completed, and it is scheduled to have instructor Xu Chengqi from the office pilot a test flight. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Aircraft Design. A New Voice reporter visited the Naval Aircraft Office yesterday to see the new aircraft. The aircraft is a biplane amphibious trainer. The fuselage is cyan-yellow, and the wings are silver-grey. The total weight is 1,600 pounds. There are two seats in the front and rear. According to Zeng Yijing, director of the office, the cost is 16,000 yuan and it took ten days to build. All materials used in the aircraft, except for the engine, which was purchased from the United States, such as metal, magnetic paint, cedar, and other miscellaneous materials, are made in China. Therefore, it is no less than a domestically produced aircraft.</p>
<p>Test Flight Today. Most of the aircraft's construction has been completed. Yesterday, Zeng Yijing was supervising the assembly by the engineering staff. It is expected to be completed this morning. It is scheduled to be piloted by Xu Chengqi, an instructor from the office, at approximately 4:00 PM today, from the Jiangmian airport to the Longhua airport for a test flight. At that time, members of the Chinese Flying Club will go to Longhua airport to watch the test flight. After the test flight, the aircraft will be handed over to the Aviation Association for use by the Flying Club members.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Special Zone Rickshaw Association to Convene a Car Owner Congress on the 27th <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>To Discuss Measures to Reduce Rickshaw Rental Fees.</p>
<p>The Special Zone Rickshaw Association will convene a car owner congress on the 27th to discuss countermeasures because the Municipal Council plans to implement a reduction in rickshaw rental fees starting on April 1. Yesterday, a notice was sent to the car merchants, stating: "This is to notify you that the Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee is a redundant organ of the Police Department. Since its establishment, its various measures, such as forcibly reducing rickshaw rental fees, forcing the replacement of new rickshaw models, restricting rickshaw puller registration, charging each person one yuan, and forcibly donating rickshaw puller mutual aid fees of seven cents per vehicle per day, are all intended to put the car merchants and rickshaw pullers to death. Although the association has negotiated, fortunately, the Municipal Council authorities have understood and have entered into agreements with the association, such as the regulations on rickshaw rental fees of 85 cents per day on August 6, 1934, and the unrestricted rickshaw puller registration on November 23. These have temporarily maintained the status quo of the rickshaw industry, which supports more than 300,000 poor Chinese in the Concession. Unfortunately, the Car Committee, due to the approaching end of its term, has intensified its efforts and has disregarded all agreements and suggested to the Municipal Council that rental fees be reduced by eight cents starting on April 1, arbitrarily restricting rickshaw pullers from earning a living, resulting in more than 20,000 unemployed people. Vehicles are parked daily, and donations and mutual aid fees must still be paid. At a time when the market is sluggish and the prices of rickshaw materials are soaring, the impact on the rickshaw industry is profound and significant. As for the rickshaw pullers who are unemployed due to the Car Committee's refusal to register them, they are still responsible for maintaining their livelihoods, and they are all exhausted. In order to save the livelihoods of our colleagues in the city, it has been decided to hold a special zone car owner congress in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road at 9:00 AM on March 27 to discuss all measures to carry out the rescue. We hope that all car owners will actively participate and attend."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Provinces and Cities Respond to the Purchase of Aircraft for Birthday Greetings <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The General Team Leader's Office of the China Aviation Association Convenes the 52nd Office Affairs Meeting.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team of the China Aviation Association convened its 52nd office affairs meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM on the 21st to discuss the direction of the solicitation campaign. Those in attendance included General Manager Li Dachao, and staff members Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Zhang Xiamin, Chen Shuo, Liu Songtao, Song Zheng, Huang Jun, Bao Lengxue, Gu Dangrui, Lu Zhangyan, Wei Tingxin, Yang Peiwen, Zhu Shengyang, and Li Huiran. General Manager Li, the chairman, reported that since the association initiated the fundraising to purchase aircraft as birthday gifts for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, the city has already promoted it. In addition to the various committee members as initiators, leaders from all walks of life, agencies, and organizations have been invited to be initiators. Most parties have been contacted and have expressed their approval. The special birthday gift is based on the number of Chinese characters in the phrase "Heaven, Earth, Center, Righteousness, Peace, Harmony, Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity, Joy," and ordinary donations can be decided upon. The Stock Exchange Federation, the Ningbo Association, the Guangdong Association, and others are also actively raising funds, which is very enthusiastic. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shandong, Shanxi, and other provinces and cities, as well as the association's branches in various provinces, have responded successively, demonstrating the national compatriots' support. The association's solicitation in Shanghai is the result of the city's citizens and organizations' commitment to the aviation national salvation movement, and the enthusiastic support of various industries. They have successively suggested collecting aviation national salvation funds. Since the beginning, it has been the result of voluntary donations from people from all walks of life, and the campaign has been progressing smoothly. In recent days, telegrams have been received from the hotel industry association and various hotels reporting that the two Concession authorities have interfered with the solicitation, confiscated receipt books, and imposed fines. We are deeply surprised. The solicitation of aviation national salvation funds is a patriotic initiative of the Chinese people and is a voluntary donation. If anything unexpected happens, we will investigate in detail and find a way to resolve it. If the solicitation method is flawed, we will consider the situation and make concrete improvements to benefit our national salvation campaign. The solicitation for the civilian shipping industry was entrusted to Solicitation Team 441 in November last year, with the office at No. 518 Ping Shichang Flour Exchange, Xin Kaihe. For several months, the results have been mediocre and disputes have arisen repeatedly. In order to rectify the situation, the office was closed on the 19th and moved to the headquarters. Internal staff members were weeded out to improve the situation. The sand and gravel industry and the yellow sand crushing industry's solicitation improvement plan has been decided and notified to both parties, and will begin on April 1. The Aviation National Salvation Simple Mobile Exhibition has been completed in the Special Zone on the 23rd and will continue to be held in Pudong for ten days. After the location is selected, the date will be set. After the fieldwork staff reported the contact and inspection situation, the meeting discussed various proposals for the solicitation campaign and adjourned at 4:30 PM. It is also reported that since the Aviation Association initiated the fundraising to purchase aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, the various provinces and cities have responded successively. The association received the following telegrams from various provinces: Xu Yongchang, Chairman of Shanxi Province, stated in his telegram that the province is very willing to follow suit and plans to purchase an aircraft with 100,000 yuan to express his congratulations. The Shandong Provincial Government stated in its telegram that it would first pay 12,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft for birthday greetings. The Zhejiang Branch of the Aviation Association stated in its telegram that it had learned of the telegraph and would submit it to the council meeting on the first day of the month. It was decided that the association would initiate a call to all agencies and organizations to jointly organize the "Zhejiang Province Aircraft Fundraising Committee to Present to Chairman Chiang" to raise 150,000 yuan to purchase three aircraft and form a squadron to present to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to celebrate. The Jiangsu Branch replied in a telegram that for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, the association convened the second council meeting on the 12th and decided to raise 800,000 yuan to purchase nine aircraft and form a team to donate, which is expected to be raised before the end of May. Zhou Houjun and Li Renzai were appointed as council members to determine the method. The Henan Provincial Branch stated in a telegram that it would submit the fundraising plan to the third council meeting for decision, with a minimum fundraising target of 150,000 yuan. Li Peiji and other council members were appointed to be responsible for drafting the plan. In addition, the Nanjing Municipal Government convened representatives from various agencies and organizations on the 19th to discuss fundraising and the purchase of aircraft, deciding to raise 800,000 yuan. The city has decided to raise 1 million yuan to purchase ten aircraft as birthday gifts for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the Shanghai Fundraising Team of the Aviation Association is working hard to carry it out. The Ordinary Donation Fundraising Committee has separately solicited initiators and is conducting fundraising separately. It is reported that Yang Hu of the Central Committee is planning for the Seamen's Special Party Department and the Seamen's Union to raise 100,000 yuan. Du Yuesheng of the Committee is working with the Stock Exchange to raise 100,000 yuan. Director Cai of the Public Security Bureau plans to raise at least 10,000 yuan. Other organizations are also discussing it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Jisheng Association, which previously co-organized the winter relief efforts in Shuyang, Jiangsu, with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, has concluded its work, as detailed in previous reports. A letter was received from the county reporting on the spring famine, stating that the county was severely affected by the breach of the Yellow River south in the first half of the year and had received relief. Although it is now spring, due to excessive rain and snow in winter, the water in the disaster area has not receded, and the victims are crying of hunger and cold, their suffering even worse than before. The current spring relief is a major problem. The county magistrate, witnessing the devastation, cannot sleep in peace, and urgently requests the allocation of relief funds for spring relief. A telegram was also received from Wei Lihuang, the Commander of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Pacification Headquarters, stating that the counties in western Anhui have suffered from disasters and poor harvests for years. Now, in the spring famine, tree bark and grass roots have been almost completely consumed. As farming is about to begin, most of the plowing cattle and seeds are unavailable. Starvation deaths are reported daily, and the desperation has led to banditry, exacerbating the situation. The situation is similar in eastern Hubei and southern Henan. To address the urgent needs, spring relief and seed loans are essential. Lihuang is heartbroken by what he has seen and sends this urgent telegram to plead for the disaster victims. The association is requested to promptly allocate a large sum of relief funds and send personnel to the disaster area for proper management. Furthermore, the Jingning District Party Headquarters and Cheng Zhao Beixi and other townships in Zhejiang Province reported disaster due to hailstorms, destroying late rice crops with only 30% harvest. The winter was also marked by continuous rain and snow for months, with no clear skies. The county's main food source, sweet potato, was completely ruined by mold. Most farmers are hungry and cannot survive. In January and February of this year, the Red Army returned, invading more than ten townships, including Dadi and Jingnan, as well as Sanzhishu Village, only ten miles outside the city, causing widespread disruption. Lamentation fills the air, and there is no way to seek help. They telegraphed requesting the dispatch of personnel to the townships for relief and comfort. The association has determined that the disaster situation in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces is severe, with numerous letters and telegrams arriving.

<h3 id="e154">Zhabei's Aid to Wang: Council Meeting Due to Hardship Incurred in Public Service <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Mr. Wang Binyan of Zhabei received a notice from the Shanghai District Court stating that his residence would be sealed on the 23rd of this month. Upon hearing this news, local public organizations convened an emergency meeting of the Aid Wang Council. Those in attendance included Yin Cunfu, She Xipin, Cai Qiaojun, Li Guangzhen, Chen Weihan, Wang Yiwei, Jiang Zhongliang, Hu Yibo, Wei Zhiqi, Ye Qichang, Xu Zaikang, Qi Bingjun, Ma Rugen, Luo Xingyou, and many other council members. Chairman Yin Cunfu stated that the council has repeatedly petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government for the return of funds due to the hardship incurred by Mr. Wang Binyan in public service, as well as asking the Shanghai Municipal Government to provide assistance and the Ministry of Finance to provide relief. The exchange of official documents has been voluminous. Mayor Wu has indeed provided assistance, for which we are deeply grateful. The Ministry of Finance believes that this is a local debt and should be resolved by Jiangsu Province itself. Although the Jiangsu Provincial Government acknowledges it as a provincial debt, it has no funds to allocate at the moment and suggests that the national treasury should first repay a portion. Therefore, the matter remains unresolved. At the last meeting, all the circumstances were presented to the Executive Yuan for an appeal, but there has been no response yet. Unexpectedly, the court, due to the lawsuit filed by the creditor Guangdong Bank, has no choice but to seal his private property tomorrow. From then on, Mr. Wang's residence will have to be auctioned off to repay the debt, leaving him with no place to live. This is truly heartbreaking. This loan was originally used to cover urgent military expenses. In order to meet the urgent need, he temporarily mortgaged his private residence. The council members were all those who provided funds at the time and should be aware of this. Mr. Wang has suffered for the public good, and there is no way to redress the grievance. Although Shanghai gentry and businessmen Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Lin Kanghou, Chen Aishi, Zhang Xiaolin, and Shen Lianfang have repeatedly telegraphed the provincial government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting the allocation of 84,000 yuan to settle the personal debt and end the lawsuit, it has been unsuccessful. We are deeply grateful for their enthusiastic assistance. However, once the property is sealed, Mr. Wang will suffer even more. What measures should we take to provide assistance? Chen Weihan, Xu Zaikang, and others spoke in succession, discussing two possible solutions: First, we should send representatives to negotiate with the creditor to request a temporary suspension of the lawsuit, pending the Executive Yuan's approval, which will provide a solution. We should also go to Tongdeli to request a delay in the sealing and submit it to the court for verification. We should also ask Mr. Du Yuesheng for assistance. This was unanimously approved. Second, we should telegram Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, requesting relief. The Ministry of Finance should temporarily advance 84,000 yuan to settle the lawsuit and personal debts, and then order the provincial government to settle the real estate and all debts. We should also telegraph the provincial government and the Ministry of Finance again, requesting that they present the circumstances to the Executive Yuan, proving the facts. Representatives should be sent to meet with President Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Chen Aishi and Mr. Zhang Yueli, explaining Mr. Wang's situation and the various ways he has served the government, requesting assistance. This was unanimously approved. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Generous Donation for Construction of the City Hospital Laboratory</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu of Yong An Tiger Balm Hall returned to China from overseas in 1934. Upon visiting Shanghai to inspect municipal construction, he realized the importance of urban medical facilities and generously donated 110,000 yuan of his own funds for the construction of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital Laboratory. The Shanghai Municipal Government, recognizing Mr. Hu's enthusiasm for public welfare and social benefit, immediately telegraphed its gratitude on behalf of the entire citizenry and requested the central government to commend him to promote his benevolence. The municipal government has now approved the Ministry of Health's dispatch of a "Doing Good and Benefiting Society" plaque, a certificate of commendation, a gold medal of commendation from the Ministry of Health, and a license from the National Government, to be presented to Mr. Hu for his reception and wearing. The original dispatch is recorded below: The Ministry of Health of the Executive Yuan consulted, stating that, according to the Executive Yuan's instructions No. 1471 of March 7, 1936, the Ministry had previously submitted the Shanghai Municipal Government's request for commendation of overseas compatriot Hu Wenhu, along with documents, requesting review and instructions. The matter was forwarded and instructions were given. National Government Order No. 497 was received, stating that the report and documents have been received and acknowledged. Approval is granted for the inscription and distribution of a "Doing Good and Benefiting Society" plaque, which should be forwarded for receipt. The plaque inscription will be sent separately, and the documents will be kept on file. This order, and so on. Upon receiving this, this case had been previously approved by the Municipal Government and reported to the Ministry, and a reply had been sent. Now, in light of the previous cause, the plaque inscription, certificate of commendation, and a gold first-class medal from the Ministry are sent together for verification and forwarding. Sincerely, The Ministry of Health.</p>

After the incident, Officer Miao of the Yangjing Police Station found three pistol shell casings at the scene.</p>

<p>Brutal Attack Without Reason</p>
<p>Russian Arrested and Detained Awaiting Punishment</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Shengjing ship had returned to Shanghai from Tianjin after loading cargo. Before the unloading was completed, at 6:40 PM in the evening, a dockworker named A Fu (from Zhenjiang), accompanied by his companion Zhang Maoshun (from Ningbo), boarded the ship to check how much cargo remained. A Russian guard named Kexin (transliteration), saw them and went to drive them away. A Fu and Zhang knew they could not reason with him and started to walk back to the dock and had just stepped onto the ladder when the guard kicked Zhang Maoshun, who was at the back, five times in the lower body with his leather shoe. He then turned around and kicked A Fu in the lower body, injuring him. A Fu immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. His companion helped A Fu onto the dock and was preparing to send him to the hospital, but A Fu died within half an hour. The Water Police Station learned of the incident. Considering it a case of homicide, they immediately dispatched a detective to board the ship and take the Russian guard Kexin into custody. Yesterday morning, Detective Cheng Yongnian submitted a report to the District Court, requesting an inquest and asking that the Russian be taken into custody for investigation. Chief Judge Zhong immediately prepared a document, dispatched police to accompany Detective Cheng to the British Consulate to sign it, and then brought the Russian back to the court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu filed the case for investigation. As a result, he ordered the suspect to be detained pending further instructions. Prosecutor Liu Shiqing and Investigator Shen Qixiu arrived on the scene to conduct an inquest.</p>

<p>New Inmate Should Not Have Been Beaten by the Group</p>
<p>Two Front Teeth Were Knocked Out</p>
<p>Yang Jinkui, a 40-year-old man from Anhui who had previously been a clerical worker, was sentenced to three years in prison by the Second Special Court on December 18, 1933, for theft. He was released on parole from the Second Special District Prison on October 27 of last year. On the 4th of this month, he was detained by the Public Concession police on suspicion of pickpocketing on a tram and brought to the First Special Court. He was found not guilty due to lack of evidence. However, a parole certificate from the Second Special Court was found on Yang, so he was sent to the French Concession police station. On the 21st, he was handed over to the Second Special Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang of the police station stated that the defendant's address after parole did not match his current address, which was a violation of parole regulations. Yang argued that his residence was not in violation, and the theft in the British Concession was only a suspicion. He pleaded for investigation, stating that he was engaged in honest business and dared not violate the law. Judge Wang Gangxu reviewed the testimony and ordered Yang to be temporarily detained pending execution and that his guarantor be brought in to take him away. Thus, Yang Jinkui was temporarily detained in the Special Four room of the Second Special Court detention center. To everyone's surprise, prisoners Dong Afu (a 30-year-old Ningbo man sentenced to two and a half years for theft) and Sun Azhong (a 30-year-old Ningbo man sentenced to two and a half years for theft), who were responsible for cleaning duties in the detention center (referred to as "small chains"), saw that Yang was well-dressed and believed he was a wealthy detainee. They attempted to extort money from him unsuccessfully. On the 22nd (Sunday), they led more than ten other detainees in beating Yang, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. The warden learned of the incident and went to the scene, causing the perpetrators to scatter. Yang Jinkui identified Dong and Sun as the ringleaders. The warden reported the incident to the Second Special Court Procuratorate. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Wang Ren and a clerk went to the Fifth Court to investigate. Yang Jinkui testified that on Saturday of last week, he was temporarily detained in the Special Four room of the detention center, where a "small chain" (Dong Afu) told him to be sensible and asked if he understood the rules. He was told to write a note to his family to send money to treat the others (referred to as "running a note"). When he refused, Dong slapped him twice. Yesterday, he was moved to Special One, told to sit in the toilet, and then a group arrived, covered his face with a handkerchief, and threw him to the ground with force (referred to as "pushing the mountain and overturning the earth"). He lost consciousness and two of his front teeth were knocked out. He could not identify the other assailants. One of the guards, Zhao Qusheng, knew in advance that they were going to beat him, but not only did he not stop them, he said, "Wait until after he's off duty, then you can beat him." Officer Zhao Qusheng was summoned and asked if he knew in advance that they were going to fight. He replied that he did not. He was asked why they were fighting. He replied that it was because Yang was blocking the way when the "small chain" was taking the rice bucket out to get food, and Yang refused to move, so they argued. Dong Afu testified that it was because Yang was obstructing traffic and argued with the inmates. He denied leading a group to attack him or attempting to extort money. Sun Azhong testified that Yang and Dong argued, and he went forward to mediate, but he did not help with the assault or attempt to extort money. At this point, Prosecutor Wang told Yang Jinkui that he could request the warden to file a criminal self-accusation with the court. Dong and Sun were returned to the detention center. Yang Yugui was sent to the court for examination of his injuries.</p>

<p>Wife is Chinese, Gains Husband's Displeasure, Falsely Accused of Mental Illness</p>
<p>Asylum Doctors and Others Reported by Police Station and Sued in Court</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital, located at 7 Chunjiang Villa, Lane 888, Kangning Road, Shanghai, has been open for several years. The director is Gu Wenjun. Recently, doctors from the hospital, Chu Jiqun, male nurse Gao Xinkui, tea server Yang Caigou and Li Amao were criminally sued in the First Special District Court by the Gordon Road Police Station for illegally detaining a Tianjin woman, Pan Jingwen, from February 12th, 10 AM to the 13th, depriving her of freedom of movement, violating Article 302 of the Criminal Law on obstructing freedom, and assaulting her, violating Article 277 of the Criminal Law on injury. The Special Court issued summons yesterday morning, ordering detectives Lu Gendi and the Western Detective Chief Tuile to summon Chu Jiqun and the other three people to the Eighth Criminal Court. Judge Liu Guisheng took the seat for the trial. The victim, Pan Jingwen, hired a lawyer to attach a civil lawsuit, seeking damages of 1,488.40 yuan. The defendants also hired three lawyers to defend them. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station began by detailing the case, stating that the victim, Pan Jingwen, had been at 913 Haining Road.</p>

<p>The hospital's student member, Ms. Yu, married Mr. Jin Youshan, a Korean manager of the Jin Tuo Shuibi (Golden Camel Fountain Pen) Factory at 228 Changping Road on November 1st last year, and published a notice in the newspaper. After the marriage, they cohabited at 7 Lane 702 Gordon Road. Unexpectedly, within a few days, a rift developed between the couple. It turned out that a 19-year-old woman named Wang Jifang, a colleague of Ms. Pan, was beautiful. She often accompanied Pan Jingwen home to play, which led to Jin Youshan falling in love with her, viewing Ms. Pan as a thorn in his side. As a result, the rift arose, her treatment gradually deteriorated, and beatings followed. On February 12th of this year, they even claimed that Ms. Pan had a mental illness. Jin, along with defendants Gao Xinkui, Yang Caigou, Li Amao, as well as Gao Shizhong and two Japanese men, Mu Ling, had Pan's hands tied behind her back, hired a car, and forcibly sent her to the Shanghai Mental Hospital. After entering the hospital, they forcibly sat Ms. Pan on a chair in the courtyard, tied her hands and feet, forced her to take medicine, poured cold water on her, stripped off her clothes, and sent her to a small room upstairs, where she was locked away. At that time, Pan Jingwen, believing that she had no mental illness and that the hospital was not using proper methods of treatment but only unreasonable violence, refused to eat out of anger. The defendants then beat her with a leather whip and prohibited her from moving freely. Jin Youshan had prepaid Ms. Pan's room and board for one month, intending to imprison his wife for a long time. Unexpectedly, a maid named Niu Wangshi, who worked for Jin, witnessed her mistress being forced into a car and driven away. She immediately reported the incident to Ms. Yang Pan Jingzhi, Ms. Pan's sister. Yang Pan Jingzhi, who worked at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, immediately hired a car to the mental hospital upon hearing the news, demanding to see her sister. However, the hospital refused. After repeated requests, she was finally allowed to meet her. Seeing that her sister was covered in injuries, she called Jin Youshan at 7 p.m. on the 13th, and with his permission, transferred Pan Jingwen to the Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment. The injuries healed after three days. After being discharged from the hospital, she reported to the police station. Detective Lu Gendi and Western Detective Tuile first went to the sanatorium to obtain a medical certificate, which stated that Pan Jingwen had injuries on her right and left arms, as well as both legs and waist, with swelling on both sides, but no signs of mental illness, only slight irritation. However, the defendant, Chu Jiqing, claimed that Pan was usually prone to anger and had phlegm blockage. The police went to Jin Youshan's residence at 401, Room 8, 397 Laobazi Road, for investigation. It was confirmed that he was of Goryeo (Korean) nationality. However, Jin claimed that the dispute arose because his wife wanted to seize his authority as the manager of the pen factory, which had happened several times. It was not due to infidelity. The case concerning Jin Youshan will be handled by the Japanese consulate. An investigation revealed that the facilities inside the Shanghai Mental Hospital were not only inadequate in various aspects, but also that the hospital and the defendant, Dr. Chu Jiqing, had not formally registered with the Public Concession Health Department. According to the Public Concession regulations, anyone seeking to admit someone to a mental hospital must first obtain certificates from two doctors to be qualified. The defendants had violated these regulations. The police requested a postponement of the case because they had previously requested Dr. Wei Ligong, a forensic doctor from the court, to investigate the mental hospital, who found that the facilities were incomplete, the patient rooms were rudimentary, and there were already 20 patients inside. When the police returned to investigate a few days ago, eight people were missing. It was claimed that they had all recovered and been discharged. The remaining patients, after examination by Dr. Wei, including male Chen Zhifa, female Zhang Xianyan, and Wang Meiguan, showed no signs of mental illness and were quite lucid. Most of the patients were female, while the doctors and nurses employed by the hospital were all male. Therefore, the police need to investigate further. The victim, Pan Jingwen, claimed to be from Tianjin, 26 years old. On November 1st of last year, she married Jin Youshan through the introduction of Zhang Youfang. She stated that nine days after the marriage, Jin accused her of being old and unable to bear children, wanting to take another concubine. She argued that since the marriage had just begun, how could it be determined that she could not bear children? If she could not bear children in the future, it would not be too late to take a concubine. This led to quarrels and beatings. On the evening of February 11th, she returned home after watching a movie, and Jin, without asking the reason, ordered her to get out. The next day, he, along with the defendants Gao, Yang, and Li, tied her hands behind her back, forced her into a car, and sent her to the mental hospital. At that time, Gao Xinkui claimed to be a detective from Laoxing 136, and upon arriving at the hospital, he was the first to slap her. Yang and Li used leather belts to beat her. Despite her repeated requests, asking them not to misunderstand, explaining that it was just a family dispute, the defendants were aggressive and unreasonable, imprisoning her in a room and pouring cold water on her. In total, she was imprisoned for two days and beaten three or four times. She found that her husband, Jin Youshan, had registered with the Chinese government the year before and had become a Chinese citizen. Furthermore, witnesses Niu Wangshi and Pan Yang Jingzhi filed reports, proving everything. Questioned, Ji Jiqing stated that he and the hospital were both registered. Pan's mother was sent to the hospital by her husband, with a high temper, strong pulse, phlegm blockage, and hitting people, and unclear speech. He diagnosed her with mental illness and prescribed medicine for her. Because she refused to take the medicine, she was tied to a chair and forcibly fed, etc. Gao, Yang, and Li all denied beating her. Judge Liu instructed that the case be postponed for seven days, and all four defendants were allowed to be released on bail, subject to being summoned at any time.</p>

<p>The Hubei Provincial Government recently proposed using 60% of the income from Buddhist temples to fund education through joint security, causing great panic among the monks, who have called for help, requesting the Chinese Buddhist Association to fight for them according to the law. The Chinese Buddhist Association believes that Buddhist property is already under the supervision of the central government's Regulations for Supervising Temples, and has been repeatedly ordered to be protected by the National Government and the Executive Yuan. The province has suffered from war and floods for years, and the temples are in dire straits, unable to maintain even the Buddhist public welfare and charitable undertakings that have already been established. If they are further exploited, the livelihoods of monks and nuns throughout the province will inevitably be cut off. The Association has decided to make a concerted effort to appeal to the Hubei Provincial Government to consider public opinion and revise the General Outline for Popularizing Education. At the same time, it has telegraphed all temples in the province, urging them to refuse to allocate funds until the case is resolved.</p>

<p>Liang Tongfang, Fan Renliang, Wang Jing, and other patriotic youth from this city have organized the Chinese Youth National Goods Promotion Group, aiming to be practical and realistic, persuading compatriots across the country to use domestic goods. Since the initiation and establishment of the group, various organizations in this city, such as the National Federation of Commerce, the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Citizens' National Goods Annual Meeting, the Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association, and the China National Manufacturers' Association, as well as individuals from all walks of life, such as Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunxu, Fang Yexian, Liu Zhongying, Li Kangnian, Pan Yangyao, Ren Jinping, and Chen Binghui, have enthusiastically supported them. Preparations are now complete, and they are scheduled to depart on the Sanbei Company's Changdian ship at 6 p.m. today. The group consists of five members who will first travel along the Yangtze River, touring cities and villages across the country to promote national goods on the ground. Last night, leaders from various organizations in this city, such as the Citizens' National Goods Annual Meeting, the National Manufacturers' Association, and the Promotion of National Goods Association, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binghui, Liu Zhongying, Ge Futian, and Chen Jiufeng, held a farewell banquet at the Zhimei Restaurant on Simalu (Sichuan Road).</p>
<h3 id="e170">Recent News from the Chinese Numismatic Society <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Numismatic Society has stipulated that a research meeting will be held once a month to exchange and study knowledge of ancient coins. Yesterday (the 22nd) was the date for the society's regular research meeting. More than 20 members, including Wu Zhihui, attended. The research topic was the weight of ancient coins. From the Zhou, Qin, Han, to the Six Dynasties, the weight in *zhu* remained unchanged, with one *liang* equaling 24 *zhu*. The *Han Dabuhuang Qian* weighed one *liang*, and the *Huobu* weighed 25 *zhu*. Based on this, it can be inferred that two *Qin Banliang* were equal to one *Dabuhuang Qian*, five *Han Wushu* were equal to one *Huobu*, four *Sanshu* were equal to one *Qin Banliang*, and each *Bailiang Wushu* weighed eight *zhu*, so three were equal to one *Dabuhuang Qian*, and one was equal to four *zhu*. This continued until the Tang Dynasty, when the system changed greatly. In the early Tang Dynasty, ten *Kaiyuan* coins were equal to one *Tangquan liang*, the same as 60 ancient *zhu*. The people of the Song Dynasty only knew that one *liang* was 24 *zhu*, so they considered each *Kaiyuan* coin to be 2.4 *zhu*, which was a big mistake. In fact, each *Kaiyuan* coin should weigh six *zhu* when measured with an ancient scale. Coin records state that the Song Dynasty scholars' examination of *zhu* was all wrong. The records cited the weights from old documents, which were the system before the Six Dynasties, and were quite valuable. Knowing this and using it to read coin records can prevent one from being misled by the ancients.

<h3 id="e174">Longhua Temple Opens <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Longhua Temple in western Shanghai is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai. It is said to have been built during the Chiwu period (Three Kingdoms era). The temple has a bronze Buddha statue of over 2,000 years old, and the Sutra Depository houses 2,000 volumes of palm-leaf scriptures, but unfortunately, they have been lost, and few remain. The temple is magnificent and very grand. However, it has suffered from repeated wars and is in a dilapidated state. Last spring, the abbot of the temple, Xingkong, renovated it at a cost of 40,000 gold pieces, making it look brand new inside and out. In front of the temple is a seven-story pagoda, next to which is a monument to the soldiers of the 32nd Army who died in battle. Every spring, when the sun shines brightly, and the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green, Longhua Road is crowded with tourists. Recently, due to the warmer weather, the temple was fully opened yesterday for people to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Zheng Yongyu's Appeal Rejected <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Yongyu sued Zheng Bozhao for embezzlement and breach of trust. Because he did not accept the first instance judgment of the First Special Court on January 22, he filed an appeal. The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has now ruled to reject the appeal. The reasons for the judgment are recorded as follows: According to Article 294 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a judgment of dismissal should be pronounced if the statute of limitations for the right to prosecute has expired. After reviewing the original file, the main point of the appellant's lawsuit against Zheng Bozhao for embezzlement and breach of trust lies in attacking Zheng Bozhao for violating his duties and embezzling the Yongtaihe brand name and patent rights before the 28th year (1908 in the Western calendar). Regardless of whether it is calculated according to the seven-year statute of limitations stipulated in Article 69, Paragraph 1 of the old criminal law applicable at that time, or according to the ten-year statute of limitations period stipulated in Article 80, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Criminal Law, it has long expired. The original judgment only failed to cite the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. However, its application of the old criminal law Article 69, Paragraph 1, Items 3 and 4, which is most favorable to the actor, considered that the statute of limitations had expired, and pronounced a judgment of dismissal according to the aforementioned provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. The result is not inappropriate. The appellant's intent is to claim that Yongtaihe is a branch of Yongtai Zhan, and that Zheng Bozhao's use of its brand name and occupation of its profits every day constitutes a continuous act of breach of trust and embezzlement. According to the provisions of Article 80, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the statute of limitations cannot expire, etc. It is not known that both the crime of embezzlement and breach of trust are both immediate crimes, and the object of the crime of embezzlement only applies to objects and does not include rights. If the embezzlement alleged by the appellant refers to the shop foundation of Yongtai Zhan, then the reorganization of Yongtai Zhan into Yongtaihe was far back in the first year of the Republic of China. Even if Zheng Bozhao had embezzled the shop foundation of Yongtai Zhan, it would have long exceeded the statutory period of extinction. If the embezzlement alleged by the appellant refers to the patent rights for contracting various cigarettes from the British American Tobacco Company, then according to the testimony of Yuse Baise Te, a director of the company, in the original trial, "After I joined the company in 1912, I never knew that Yongtai Zhan had contracted cigarette sales. The contract photo held by the appellant is not a contract for selling the Great Britain brand. Yongtaihe was contracted by Zheng Bozhao, and later changed to a company (in the tenth year of the Republic of China), which he continued to sell." Therefore, even if Yongtai Zhan had contracted cigarette sales for the British American Tobacco Company in the late Qing Dynasty, since the beginning of the Republic of China, its sales rights have long ceased to exist, and there is no continuous or continued embezzlement. As for the breach of trust alleged by the appellant, there are also no specific facts to point to. Moreover, Zheng Bozhao resigned from his position in the seventh year of the Republic of China, which was also admitted by the appellant. Then, calculated from that year, the statute of limitations has also expired. Therefore, the appellant's intent cannot be considered reasonable, no matter from which perspective it is judged. Based on the above conclusion, the judgment should be made according to Article 360 and Article 360 of the Criminal Procedure Law as in the main text.</p>

<p>Xia Zhou, a woman from Huzhou, 36 years old, had been working as a maid for several years at Wu Pinji's sand and gravel business at 6 Tongren Lane, 231 Wuchang Road. Recently, she had a relationship with a certain person and became pregnant for two months. Her abdomen was swollen, which was unseemly. She asked Dai Li, a woman from Gaoyou, to find a way to terminate the pregnancy. Dai introduced her to Li Wu, an old woman from the same hometown, at 38 Zhitong Road, Jiaobei, who agreed to do it for 5 yuan and 5 jiao. Li Wu then inserted a herbal root into Xia Zhou's lower body. However, the surgery was not successful, and she fell ill in bed, moaning in pain. After the hostess noticed, she was sent to Kuangren Hospital for treatment the other day. The treatment was ineffective, and she bled profusely from her lower body and died at 1 a.m. The hospital notified the Hongkou police station, who sent detectives Yang Xianchen and Wang Shubei to the hospital. They transported Xia Zhou's body to the Philun Road mortuary for examination. Dai Li was arrested on Zhitong Road, Jiaobei, but Li Wu had fled after hearing the news. Dai Li was taken to the police station and transferred to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was taken to the Criminal Court III of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Concession, narrated the events in detail and requested a postponement. Questioned, Dai Li's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be remanded in custody and postponed the case for further investigation. Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the court, arrived at the mortuary to examine Xia Zhou's body and stated that the deceased Xia Zhou, a female, had died as a result of an abortion performed during her lifetime. The body was allowed to be collected by her employer, Wu Pinji, to wait for her family to come to Shanghai to claim it.</p>

<p>Yesterday (23rd) at around 4 p.m., a fire broke out for unknown reasons at Liu Yiji Huangbao Car Company, 479 Kim Shenfu Road (Avenue du Père Froc) and Xujiahui Road, French Concession, suddenly bursting through the roof and spreading rapidly. The fire brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene and extinguished it after a while. In this incident, in addition to Liu Yiji's building being completely burned down, the upper floor of Wudetai, 480 next door, was also destroyed. A fire suddenly broke out at the home of Mr. Parker, a British man living at 337 Hongqiao Road, yesterday morning. The family managed to extinguish the fire, preventing it from spreading. When the fire was not extinguished, Parker telegraphed the Central Fire Brigade, which dispatched three vehicles to extinguish the fire. When reporters arrived, the fire had already been extinguished. According to investigations, the fire was caused by the heating of the chimney pipe on the third floor. Parker works for Yeguang Real Estate Company in the 12-hour shift. His family is well-off, and they live in a large three-story foreign house with radiators installed. Therefore, the stove for boiling water is very large, and the heating power is very strong, causing the chimney partition to dry out. The family had not noticed, resulting in this unfortunate incident.</p>

<p>To the Editor, According to the legal representative of Siming Bank, upon reading various newspapers, they used large-print headlines to indicate that the Gentai Factory owed rent, and that Cheng Yize was not a shareholder, and had withdrawn part of the case. The content of the articles was all about using our bank's lawsuit to confirm the invalidity of Gentai's withdrawal of the lease and fabricating things out of thin air to benefit Cheng Yize. The intention was to have reporters distribute the articles to various newspapers on the same day, in order to deceive other claim holders and prevent them from listing him as a defendant. However, while our bank withdrew the confirmation lawsuit, it still filed a lawsuit for payment. The list of defendants is the same for both lawsuits, without any changes, including Li Quanshen, the manager of the Gentai Hepen Factory, shareholders Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize, and Hu Xiannan, a related party. We request that the two drafts of the lawsuits be sent to the newspapers on our behalf, and urge them to accurately correct the names of the defendants in the letter, so that the truth is not obscured by false statements, and those who fabricate falsehoods will only work harder without success, and the truth can be revealed to all sectors. Therefore, we are urgently writing to your newspaper on behalf of the bank and hope that you will check the precedent for corrections and make the corrections accordingly.

<p>A Glimpse of Wuzhou, Guangxi's Commercial Center</p>
<p>Wuzhou is located in the east of Guangxi Province, at the meeting point of the Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. It is not only a passage into Guangdong and Hong Kong, but also a distribution center for goods from the three provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Commerce and navigation have always been developed here, making it a hub of commerce in Guangxi Province. However, due to the decline of the rural economy in recent years, it has also been affected by the economic downturn, and commerce has plummeted. The population has decreased from 120,000 to around 80,000. In the 24th year, more than 20 commercial establishments closed down, and the Yongfu Company, jointly operated with Guo Shunhe, also ended its operations. Although the market is desolate, the people are accustomed to diligence and simplicity. Women also work hard and diligently engage in production. There are no cars on the streets, and only a dozen rickshaws. People regard riding in cars as a disgrace. This spirit of perseverance is unmatched by other provinces. I visited Guangxi University and met Principal Ma Jiawei. We were delighted to see each other. I said that Shanghai's industries should pay more attention to inland industries in the future. The establishment of heavy industries should be based inland, which would not only revitalize the rural economy but also avoid danger. Guangxi is a poor province, and there are concerns about the lack of financial resources and talent. In terms of talent, Guangxi University has established four colleges: science, agriculture, engineering, and mining. It is hoped that technical talents will be trained as much as possible to develop the local economy. Young people are fond of studying literature and law. I want to correct this problem. Therefore, Guangxi University does not have colleges of literature and law to achieve industrial salvation of the country. My colleagues and I were very interested in observing the practical spirit of the students of the agriculture and engineering colleges. Principal Ma said that students should not only be students but also soldiers and laborers. So I call the students production soldiers, and we laughed together. Principal Ma inquired about the current situation of vocational education, saying that Guangxi is strongly promoting vocational education, but the issue of employment needs to be studied. I visited the military training of the girls' high school, combining military affairs with learning. This is the case throughout the province, which is admirable. I visited the sulfuric acid plant, tung oil plant, match factory, pharmaceutical factory, etc. The scale is complete. According to Chen Xiongjun, manager of the Export Trade Office, 210,000 tons of tung oil are sold annually, worth more than 10 million silver dollars. Minerals such as tungsten, tin, manganese, and antimony are also increasing. I deeply hope that the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai and Guangxi can work together to transport and exchange goods between the two sides. In the future, Wuzhou may have hope for commercial recovery.</p>

<p>The Vacancy Left by Qiu Changkang Has Been Newly Filled</p>
<p>Xie Shuying is Going Abroad and Will Have a Concurrent Replacement</p>
<p>The Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education has two sections, the first and second. Qiu Changkang, the section chief of the second section, has been reassigned as the secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Germany. After following Ambassador Cheng Tianfang to take office, the Ministry of Education temporarily appointed Sun Guofeng, a supervisor of the Ministry, as the concurrent section chief of the second section of the Higher Education Department. Recently, the Ministry of Education announced that Xue Peiyuan, the president of the Provincial Hebei Agricultural College, will be the section chief of the second section of the Higher Education Department. Xue has already arrived at the ministry to take office. Xie Shuying, the section chief of the first section of the Higher Education Department (currently a supervisor and section chief), is now sent by the Ministry of Education to various European countries to inspect education for a period of eight months, leaving on April 13th. All duties of the Ministry of Education will be concurrently held by Sun Guofeng, a supervisor. Xie served as a section chief during the University Council era and has served as a section chief for nine years since the establishment of the Ministry of Education. He is from Shaanxi, and Chairman Shao of Shaanxi Province relies on him heavily. Shao once requested Xie to go abroad for inspection the year before last, but Xie did not go because the Ministry of Education was compiling university curricula and was busy with affairs. This time, he decided to go in the name of an inspection assigned by the Ministry, and Shaanxi Province exempted him from subsidies. The remaining expenses were borne by Xie himself, and the Ministry of Education retained his position and suspended his salary. Therefore, it is still planned to have a simple member of the Ministry concurrently handle his affairs.</p>

<p>Special Solicitation of Teaching Research Reports for Various Subjects from Schools and Solicitation of Learning Experience Reports for Various Subjects from Students; Two Solicitation Methods Have Been Formulated and Announced by the Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau yesterday instructed the city's municipal and private registered middle schools and normal schools: It is found that the Shanghai Middle School and Normal School Education Research Conference held its second conference of the 24th year on the 13th of this month. It was decided that the central research issues for this year would be "Teaching Methods for Various Subjects" and "National Crisis Education." The bureau has formulated methods for carrying out each research issue separately. It has now been decided by the bureau that, in addition to the research on national crisis education, which should be discussed collectively after the groups are determined, the research on teaching methods for various subjects should start with the solicitation of teaching research reports from teachers and learning experience reports from students from various schools. The materials obtained will be used as reference for research. Two methods for collecting teaching research reports and learning experience reports for various subjects, and a learning experience report form are formulated and printed with this document. The principals of the schools are requested to strictly abide by them and submit them to the bureau for review on time. In addition, this semester, the conference will be divided into two groups: teaching methods and national crisis education. The school should indicate which group it voluntarily joins and the subject of teaching research it identifies (in accordance with Article 11 of the method for collecting teaching research reports for various subjects) on the attached postcard and send it to the bureau within three days of receiving this document for compilation. This is very important. This order is attached with the collection methods as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e194">Collection of Teaching Research Reports <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Collection Method: Municipal and private registered middle schools and normal schools in this city must submit teaching research reports for various subjects in accordance with this method. Teaching research reports for various subjects are temporarily limited to junior middle schools and junior normal schools. Teaching research reports for various subjects should be compiled by subject in accordance with the subjects stipulated in the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry. When necessary, they should also be compiled by category in accordance with the types of assignments stipulated in the curriculum standards for each subject. The content of teaching research reports for various subjects should be divided into at least the following four items: A. Research on educational objectives; B. Research on teaching time; C. Research on teaching materials; D. Research on teaching methods. The research on teaching objectives should not only elaborate on the meaning of the objectives stipulated in the curriculum standards, but also express detailed opinions based on personal opinions. The research on teaching time should not only cover teaching time in class, but also the allocation of homework time outside of class, all of which should be compiled by grade. The research on teaching materials should not only be based on the teaching material outline stipulated in the curriculum standards and provide detailed critical discussion on its value, but also pay attention to the research on homework materials, all of which should be compiled by grade. The research on teaching methods should not only explore general principles, but also seek concrete and effective solutions to the difficulties encountered in teaching based on practical experience. When necessary, in addition to compiling by grade, it should also be compiled by item according to the different nature of teaching materials. If schools have research experiences or implementation reports other than the above four contents, they should also be compiled together. In principle, each school should submit research reports for at least one subject, which should be determined by the school itself first, but the Education Bureau may change or designate it separately when necessary. After the promulgation of this method, the principal of each school should immediately convene a meeting of teachers and staff or directly determine the subject to be responsible for research and report it to the Education Bureau for filing. After the subject of research is determined, the principal of each school should convene a meeting of teachers responsible for the subject to discuss and draft a report method, which should be jointly drafted by the teachers responsible for the subject. After the teachers responsible for each subject have prepared the research report, it should be submitted to the principal for review and consolidation, or submitted to the faculty and staff meeting for joint discussion, and then the official report should be prepared and submitted to the Education Bureau by April 15th of the 25th year for forwarding to the conference. The quality of the content of the research reports of each school may be listed by the Education Bureau as one of the important evaluations of the schools and teachers in this semester. If there are any shortcomings in this method, the chairman of this conference may revise it at any time. This method shall be formulated by the chairman of this conference and promulgated and implemented by the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Solicitation of Learning Experience Reports <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Solicitation Method: This conference, in order to study teaching methods for various subjects and improve teaching effectiveness, specially solicits learning experience reports for various subjects from students of municipal and private registered middle schools and normal schools in the city, and makes a form for distribution to schools to order students to fill in and report. All students of municipal and private registered middle schools and normal schools in this city must fill in the form in accordance with this method. Learning experience reports for various subjects are temporarily limited to junior middle schools and junior normal schools. Learning experience reports for various subjects should be compiled by subject in accordance with the subjects studied. When necessary, they should also be compiled by item according to the types of assignments for each subject. The content of learning experience reports for various subjects is divided into the following items: A. Learning objectives: Why do I want to study this subject? B. Learning interest: How interested am I in this subject? C. Learning time: How do I allocate my homework time outside of regular class time for this subject? D. Learning materials: What are my opinions on the materials I have learned for this subject? In addition to the materials assigned by the teacher, what other supplementary materials do I find myself? E. Learning methods: Do I have a predetermined plan and a certain principle for the learning method of this subject? How does the teacher guide me to learn? In addition to the learning methods guided by the teacher, what other effective methods have I researched myself? F. Difficulties encountered: What difficulties do I encounter in learning this subject? Is there a solution? G. Personal hopes: What hopes do I have for this subject in order to increase learning effectiveness? Whether for the school, for the teacher, for the students, or for myself. H. Other: Do I have any other opinions and experiences on this subject? There is no requirement for the subject to be solicited. Each person can choose one or several subjects, or only one or several items in the assignment category of a certain subject. There is no requirement for the writing style of the solicitation, but the principle is to be detailed and concise. The principal of each school should, after the promulgation of this method, immediately convene the class teachers or responsible counselors of each grade to explain the method, and the class teachers or responsible counselors should guide the students to respond to the solicitation. Under the principle of not hindering the free expression of students, the teachers responsible for each subject may give appropriate guidance before the students respond to the solicitation, but the principle is to provide joint guidance to the entire grade and not to provide direct suggestions. The solicitation reports should be submitted by the students to the class teacher or responsible counselor, and then submitted to the principal for consolidation. After the principal has sorted them by subject and grade, they should be submitted to the Education Bureau for forwarding to the conference. The deadline for each school to submit solicitation reports is April 15th of the 25th year. After the solicitation reports of each school are reviewed by the conference, the Education Bureau will select the best ones for awards. The form for learning each report shall be formulated by this conference and reprinted by each school according to the form. If there are any shortcomings in this method, the chairman of this conference may revise it at any time. This method shall be formulated by the chairman of this conference and promulgated and implemented by the Education Bureau.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>At that moment, Laurie had already slipped into the hall and said a word to the children, and immediately the whole group rushed in, holding hands, forming a circle, dancing around Uncle Plover and Aunt Plover, singing briskly?</p>
<p>"Spring ploughing and summer weeding,</p>
<p>Planting hundreds of grains,</p>
<p>Harvesting abundant crops,</p>
<p>Autumn harvest connects the houses.</p>
<p>The community wine has been drunk,</p>
<p>The happy meeting is coming to an end,</p>
<p>To express gratitude,</p>
<p>There is still one thing,</p>
<p>Planting grains is plentiful,</p>
<p>Planting people is especially urgent,</p>
<p>Lively children,</p>
<p>Cultivating into outstanding talents.</p>
<p>We this evening,</p>
<p>Singing and dancing,</p>
<p>Thank you teachers,</p>
<p>Kindness is like parents."</p>
<p>When singing to the last sentence, the circle gradually converged, until the good professor and his wife were surrounded by many arms, and almost half-hidden by a living wreath formed by many smiling faces—this shows that a kind of "love" has taken root and flourished in every small circle. Because "love" is a flower that grows without choosing soil, accomplishing its wonderful miracle, unchanging through autumn frost and winter snow, blooming with beautiful and fragrant flowers in all seasons, and blessing its recipients and givers.

<h3 id="e197">Shanghai Boy Scout Spring Break Trip to Hangzhou: Must Comply with the Council's Circular <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scout Council, in view of the fact that many Boy Scouts in the city will travel to Hangzhou during the spring break, in order to unify actions and maintain reputation, specially issued a circular to various groups yesterday, and attached the Hangzhou Travel Management Measures for compliance. The details are explored as follows:</p>
<p>Circular to Various Groups: For information, it is found that the Zhejiang Provincial Boy Scouts are scheduled to hold a conference in Hangzhou on April 4th. It is the spring break, and it is appropriate for each group to take this opportunity to travel to Hangzhou, first to visit the conference to increase the knowledge of the members, and also to visit scenic spots and historical sites to practice outdoor life. In order to reduce the cost of each group's trip to Hangzhou and unify actions in Hangzhou, in addition to negotiating with the Ministry of Railways, all Boy Scouts in the city going to Hangzhou are allowed to reduce the round-trip ordinary ticket price by 50% by referring to the student group travel fare reduction method. Among them, Boy Scouts under the age of 20 are also allowed to calculate the number of people as two people for one person when calculating the number of people, but they are not allowed to take special express trains. A kind of Shanghai Boy Scout Spring Break Hangzhou Travel Management Measures is specially formulated and issued with this document. If the group holds a Hangzhou trip during the spring break, it must comply with it in order to unify actions, strengthen the observation, and protect the reputation of the Boy Scouts in this city.</p>
<p>Travel Management Measures: All groups in this city traveling to Hangzhou during the spring break must comply with this method. After each group has determined the number of people going to Hangzhou and the date and time of departure and return to Shanghai, they can present a petition to send someone to the council to collect a certificate and go to the railway bureau to handle the procedures for earning tickets and booking cars. The date and time of departure and return to Shanghai and the accommodation and meals in Hangzhou are all at the discretion of each group. Boy Scouts from each group in Hangzhou must arrive at the lakeside public stadium before 7:00 am on April 4th to report. The council will send someone to lead the team to visit the Zhejiang Provincial Fifth Congress Review Ceremony, but the following items must be noted: 1. The clothing must comply with the regulations and strive to be clean; 2. The spirit must be invigorated; 3. The military sticks and flags must not be brought; 4. Except for those designated by the council, the other groups must not bring the band. In addition to visiting the Congress Review Ceremony, other sightseeing activities are free, but the following items must be noted: 1. Strictly abide by discipline and must not have excessive behavior; 2. Constantly straighten the clothing and pay attention to the body section; 3. Must not have disrespectful behavior towards friendly groups in this city and Zhejiang Province Boy Scouts. If anyone violates the above points, the council may, based on the report or report, investigate and determine the facts, and give the person in charge of each group and the offending members appropriate punishment, and may order them to return to Shanghai if necessary. Those who strictly abide by discipline and perform well will be commended by the council. The address of the council members in Hangzhou can be inquired at the Lakeside Public Education Center.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Shanghai Blind Children School Fundraising Campaign: April 4th, Chinese and Foreign Boy Scouts Will Donate Along the Way for One Day <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The School for Blind Children at 290 Hongqiao Road in this city was specially established by British scholar Dr. Chuan Lanya to educate Chinese blind children and enable them to study and learn skills to become useful talents. It has been established for more than 20 years, and the achievements are outstanding. The talents it has cultivated serve in the community and are all competent and happy. It is praised by Chinese and foreign people, and often helps with donations. The large ones, such as the Rotary Club of Shanghai, have donated three craft department houses. Mr. Lister's will donated a fund of 50,000 taels. Minister Song's mother donated 9,000 yuan to promote it. Initially, the school was located in the school building built by Chuan Bo ten donations on Yidingpan Road. However, because the number of applicants is increasing day by day, the original school site is not enough. Four years ago, the original site on Yidingpan Road was sold and more than 20 acres of land were purchased on Hongqiao Road to build 12 houses to expand. As a result, the interest on the fund is difficult to cover the distribution of the business. In addition, the atmosphere of economic downturn covers the whole society, and the sources of various donations are becoming more and more detailed, and it is difficult to continue. Although it has been assisted by Chinese and foreign people over the years, such as Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Minister Song Ziwen, Minister Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting, Li Ming, Liu Hongsheng, and Zhu Shaoping have generously donated huge amounts of money. However, due to the daily development of the business and the addition of a deaf and mute department, it is more costly to teach deaf and mute students to speak, read, and learn art. The school is now scheduled to invite Chinese and foreign Boy Scouts and Chinese and Western gentlemen and ladies on April 4th to hold a one-day donation campaign along the way. However, the school has traditionally received donations from Westerners. I think there are many enthusiastic philanthropists in our country. For this kind of Westerners' enthusiastic education of Chinese disabled children, they will not bear to let it be abandoned halfway. If you are generously donating, you can send it to Chuan Bulao, the principal of the school.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Russian Team Performance Was Brilliant, But a 2-1 Victory Was Inconsequential</p>
<p>Sea Youth Only Won the First Game, but Retaining the Championship is Still Pleasing</p>
<p>The final match of the Group A of the West Youth Eighth Volleyball League took place last night between Sea Youth and the Russian team, starting at 7:15 PM. In the first round, Sea Youth defeated the Russian team in straight sets, so it was widely expected that Sea Youth would win yesterday's match. However, unexpectedly, the Russian team's performance was full of brilliance, especially Polokoff's serves, which were as fast as cannonballs, leaving Sea Youth helpless. Zheng Yiquan and Mai Bingyao of Sea Youth were still abnormally nervous, but repeatedly made surprising moves, earning the audience's praise. In the end, the Russian team won 2-1, but because of their previous defeat in three games, the championship still belonged to Sea Youth. The overall results and details of yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Team  Total Matches  Games Won  Games Lost  Percentage</p>
<p>Sea Youth 8    21   3   0.875</p>
<p>Russian Team  8    19   5   0.791</p>
<p>West Youth  8    12   12   0.500</p>
<p>Mai Ling  8    6    18   0.333</p>
<p>China Youth  2    2    22   0.083 (Copyright)</p>
<p>Sea Youth Wins First Game with an Intimidating Display  When the referee, Bratov, blew his whistle, the two sides began to engage. Mai Bingyao of Sea Youth served first, and Zheng Yiquan cut through three lines of defense. The Russian team's Qinuofu immediately responded, taking the lead with 6 to 3. Sea Youth did not show any weakness, and Zheng and Mai displayed their unique skills, quickly increasing the score. Then, an internal misunderstanding occurred, allowing the Russian team to seize the opportunity to regain two points. Ge Cai of Sea Youth successfully blocked the Russian team, making them tremble with fear. Zheng Yiquan unleashed his military prowess, launching a lightning-like attack, winning several points in a row. Mai Bingyao, seeing this, also made remarkable contributions. Sea Youth won the first game 15 to 11.</p>
<p>Sharp Serves Lead to a Tie  Changing sides, the Russian team immediately scored two points. Mai Bingyao's effective rescue helped tie the score. The Russian team's Polokoff and Qinuofu made continuous wonderful hits, repeatedly achieving success. At this point, Sea Youth's formation suddenly became chaotic. Although Mai and Zheng tried hard to resist the enemy, they were helpless and could only defend without any offensive power. The Russian team scored continuously, leading with 9 to 1. Then, it was the Russian team's Polokoff's turn to serve. His serves were like arrows, causing chaos on the landing. Sea Youth's players struggled to save the ball, admitting defeat. Qinuofu added another hit, and the Russian team won the game 15 to 1, tying the score.</p>
<p>2-1, the Russian Team's Victory is Inconsequential  In the final game, both sides gave their all. Zheng Yiquan competed with Polokoff, and Mai Bingyao matched skills with Qinuofu. Their back-and-forth play kept the audience on the edge of their seats. The Russian team scored two points first, and Sea Youth regained one point. Under the Russian team's fierce attack, Mai Bingyao dove and rolled, while Zhang Renming assisted from the side. However, the Russian team's momentum was strong, quickly taking the lead with 8 to 5. Polokoff unleashed his power again, and Zheng Yiquan, filled with anger, launched a surprise attack. Bingyao blocked and pushed, tying the score at 14. The Russian team scored again, tying the game at 15. At this critical moment, Qinuofu added two points, ending the third game with a score of 17 to 15.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Finance  Gold Market Trading is Sluggish and Declining, Sometimes No One Even Asks <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday lacked interest, and the trading floor was unusually deserted. Only over 2,000 taels were traded throughout the day, and the sluggishness of the market can be imagined. It went down six jiao and up two jiao. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was flat in both the UK and the US. A few speculators said that there would be late selling. The forward silver price in Monte Video only shrank by three hao in May, and the rest remained unchanged. Exchange rates all shrank. London spot gold did not move. The Central Bank announced that the exchange rates for the UK and US were flat, and the customs gold unit did not move. The listed standard gold price was still 245 yuan and 9 jiao. The off-floor preliminary trading opened, and it rose to 49 yuan due to the purchase by Fu and Yong. The morning opening was slightly higher, and large traders took advantage of the high price to supply, slightly weakening the market, but trading was limited. Bank interest in US dollars was minimal. Buyers bought slightly when they saw the low price. The announced silver balance tax did not move. Afterwards, it rose slightly, and many people were selling, but large traders were still buying at the low price, so the market was weak but still flat at noon.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, with only two days left for March futures, there was still no significant increase in trading. The market price also did not see any major fluctuations. The sluggish situation was slightly less than before, but the hovering situation was still difficult to change quickly. Today is the last day of this month's futures, and it is expected that it will still be difficult to escape the hovering range. Yesterday's trading increased relatively, but it only became lively after the afternoon opening. Counter number 48 bought 400,000 to 500,000, and numbers 11, 35, and 77 also had activity.

<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation weakened. The stagnation in the spot yarn sales market made people more pessimistic, and the general will of the industry tended to sell off. Once the momentum flattened, it turned downward. However, the amount absorbed by the banking, gold, and securities industries was not released, making the future direction difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Sellers Active  At the opening of the marked yarn market in the morning, the prices for each month slightly increased, but after the second session, the trend turned downward, and the decline was very strong. Because spot yarn transactions were not smooth, people in the industry were generally short, so the market was stable. Sellers were very active, and Geng Feng and Run Kang threw out goods, making the market weaker. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 7, 8, and 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the opening in the afternoon, it was reported that the Osaka Sanpin yarn market had slightly rebounded. Chang Feng, Da Ji, and Yi Chang dragged in, tightening sentiment, but the market did not show full recovery. Each month slightly increased by 1 or 2 jiao. The second and third sessions were flat, but the downward trend in the near month became more intense. By the time it was auctioned to the far month, Da Chang Cheng came to buy again, and the market recovered. As a result, the near month fell by 4, 5, and 6 jiao compared with the closing price of the morning, and the August price increased by 1 jiao. Geng Feng sold 2,000 bales, Xing Chang sold 550 bales, Chang Yu sold 900 bales, Ren Feng sold 1,450 bales, Tai Xing sold 600 bales, Run Kang sold 1,900 bales, Xie Cheng sold 550 bales, Tong He sold 650 bales, and Jin Kang sold 650 bales.

<p>The cotton market was weak and the situation was slightly soft. Indian cotton fell back, and the yarn market was weak, which made people lazy. Most cotton merchants were in a short position. However, Tong Ji still came to drag in additional codes. The competition between the long and short sides was fierce.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Still Fell  At the opening of the marked cotton market in the morning, although US cotton rose by 2 to 10 pounds, Indian cotton trading was not much and fell by 0.5 to 1 rupee. Osaka Sanpin cotton rose by 1 or 2 jiao. The market was calm. Yi Kang, Yuan Xing Chang, Heng Yi, etc. threw out goods. Although Tong Ji came to drag in a large amount, the market still could not support it, and the false wind was still difficult to contain. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 2 or 3 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The near month slightly improved at the opening in the afternoon. By the time it was auctioned to the far month, all prices rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half. After the second session, due to the weakness of the yarn market, it fell again. As a result, the near month fell by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half compared with the morning closing price, and the far month fell by 5 fen. Yu Da sold 1,300 piculs, Heng Yi sold 2,400 piculs, Geng Feng sold 1,500 piculs, Tong Feng sold 1,400 piculs, Ren Feng sold 1,000 piculs, Yi Kang sold 4,900 piculs, Yuan Xing Chang sold 4,800 piculs, He Xing sold 1,300 piculs, Xin Cheng sold 1,100 piculs, and Yi Da sold 1,300 piculs.

<p>The initial rise caused by war rumors was very short-lived, and futures traders took the opportunity to sell at high prices. If there are no Japanese exporters accepting hedges, market prices may be even lower. The Far East continued to show interest in Omura and Pingguoer. There were also inquiries about Bai Luo Xi and Ge Ju La cotton. In the mainland, transactions were quiet, and local factories were more interested.

<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a trend of rising in the near term and falling in the far term after the market opened in the morning. The quotation for foreign wheat was about 2 jiao lower the day before yesterday, but yesterday there was little fluctuation. At the time of opening, both long and short chips for this month had to be prepared due to the near-month expiry. Recently, there have been reports of factories drawing more due to slight demand from customer gangs, resulting in good sentiment and a gradual rush to cover shorts. April and June also rose as a result. However, from July onwards, the weather was very good, and customers from distant places were quite willing to sell, so the price fell by about 1 fen. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month had been as high as 4 jiao and 5 li due to the urgent need to cover shorts, but it fell back by 1 fen after entering. April and June saw brisk trading and stable prices. Customers continued to sell in July and August, which remained weak. As the sales market became active, the near term looked promising, and the far term was subject to the weather.</p>
<p>Warm Weather, Weak Sentiment  Wheat Futures Fell in All Months  —Spot Wheat Trading Was Still Brisk—</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a general weakness in all months after the market opened in the morning. The price of foreign wheat from abroad has been declining slightly, and the recent weather has been sunny and warm, so the sentiment of gangs in the mainland has been weak, and sellers have gradually increased, and the price has gradually been reduced, falling by 2 or 3 fen compared with the previous weekend. When the market opened in the afternoon, there were very few transactions this month, and transactions below June were not very smooth, but sentiment was bearish, and each month was down by 1 fen. As the weather is favorable, the wheat market is likely to change. The spot wheat market saw brisk trading, with high-quality goods rising by 1 or 2 fen, and medium-quality goods being flat. Shandong Yaowan wheat was opened at 5 yuan, 2 jiao and 9 fen, and 3 jiao. Tiantai wheat was opened at 5 yuan, 2 jiao and 4 fen, with 5,500 bales being processed by Fu Fu and Shen.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang were slightly scarce, with a total of more than 30 numbers (a total of more than 6,000 stones), and the sales market on this street was also more active. Tianjin, Qingdao, Longkou, and other gangs continued to process 700 to 800 bales of thick japonica rice and more than 3,000 bales of thin indica rice, so the market situation slightly changed. The price of thick early indica rice rebounded by one jiao. However, thin indica rice remained stable due to thick stockpiles. Du Yang Jian, Ruyin Bian Yuan, all remained flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang downstream of the river were 34 or 35 numbers. The market was eager to consume. The early market saw white japonica rice move slightly, and the price increased by one jiao. The evening market was stable. Yin Yuan rose by 1 or 2 jiao, and Bian Yuan increased by 7 or 8 fen.

<p>Yesterday's Customer Xian's market situation continued to be loaded from the Yangtze River area and Wintai and other ports, and speculators who had bought in the previous day also intended to withdraw, so the market sentiment was very weak. The price once fell by several fen to nearly one jiao in the morning. After the price was small, the market on this street was slightly greedy for the new stockpiles, and some also asked about the price because of the rise in the price of river rice. The market stabilized. Throughout the day, this street processed 370 bales of Xiang Jing, 130 bales of Wan rice, and 150 bales of Taizhou rice. 5,200 bales of Jiangxi rice were all processed by this street.

<p>Since Guangdong Province increased the construction fee of 2 jiao and 9 fen, the transaction of bean cake sales market has been greatly affected. The manufacturers and transporters of goods strove for it, and yesterday, the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department approved the southwest political affairs committee's order to reduce the levy by 1 jiao, and still levy 1 jiao and 5 fen per load.

<p>Since the price increase of wood ear fungus, Sichuan goods were offered at prices as high as 120 yuan. Small packages of Aviation Brand wood ear fungus also reached 110 yuan. However, recently sales have slowed and the trend has softened. Current market prices have fallen by two or three yuan, but demand remains scarce.

<p>Flannel: Sales have been quite brisk recently, with local merchants making substantial purchases. However, supplies are scarce, and the cost of new goods must be above five yuan, causing market prices to rise sharply. Lower-grade yarn flannel, formerly sold for 2 yuan 70 or 80 cents, has now uniformly risen to 2 yuan and 50 cents. Those formerly bought at 4 yuan 20 or 30 cents are now selling for over 5 yuan, and those formerly sold for 5 yuan are now increased to 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick Serge: Currently, there is a general shortage. Imports from various countries are scarce. The supply of Zhanghua Yihua goods is insufficient to meet demand, causing the market to be brisk. Although the trend is not as good as that of flannel, it is considered one of the better items in the woolen industry recently. Tianyou No. 1000 serge is transacted at 5 yuan. Ordinary Dong goods are sold for 4 yuan 70 or 80 cents. 52-inch satin-backed medium-thick serge from Yuanchang is uniformly offered at 4 yuan and 25 cents net.</p>

The standard market price is 68 yuan per case, an increase of 2 yuan from before. It is observed that very few new shipments are arriving and the market stock is low, so the market price is expected to continue to rise.</p>

The market price of firewood and charcoal in the fuel category also increased, with firewood due to a shortage of dry firewood and charcoal due to scarce supply, increasing the index by 0.19.</p>

This is a drop in the bucket, and demand still exceeds supply. As a result, the No. 1 plate has risen by two or three yuan. It is said that the next batch of arrivals may increase.</p>

<p>— (Yan Maode)</p>
<p>You must know that in an instant, the present will become the past, and the future will become the present. But the age that people live is finite, while time is limitless: within our short period of existence, we must firmly grasp reality and get to work! Don't just wait for tomorrow every day!</p>
<p>Desire has no northern boundary, and life values moderation; it is certainly reasonable to seek the satisfaction of appropriate desires within the realm of possibility. However, engaging in impossible excessive demands will make one a slave to desire for life; a lively mind will be forever trapped in a deep abyss of dissatisfaction, with no time to escape.</p>
<p>What is failure? Philippe said: "Nothing else, failure is just a stepping stone to a higher step." Many successful people are blessed by repeated failures. Without failure, I am afraid that great victories will not be obtained. And for strong people, failure is enough to increase their determination, courage, and make them successful.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Early Spring in the French Park <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The branches of the withered poplar are forcefully releasing tender green new buds. Although pine needles, cypress leaves, and wintergreen are said to be cold-resistant, when a slightly damp spring breeze blows past, they seem to be breathing softly, turning all the leaves into a charming green color. The small grasses by the pond have also discarded their gray-yellow covers, and their small tender heads have burrowed out of the ground, nodding towards the tender buds of the willow branches, as if saying, "Ha, you're here too?" The water lying quietly in the pond is also wrinkled into fine water patterns on its surface, as if showing a contented and knowing smile.</p>
<p>This is early spring in the French Park, early spring that has just escaped from the harsh winter. The birds on the branches are singing songs at the treetops, chirping and chirping. What are they singing? Hmm, maybe spring love songs. That's right, they are spring love songs. Pairs of young men and women, arm in arm, stepping with rhythmic steps, emerge from this grove, saying (sweet words of spring, full of natural laughter, slowly turning into another grove. It is said that the solitary do not see the change of seasons, what they can feel is only the boredom that grows out of being surrounded by the atmosphere of spring. The little birds on the branches are startled and fly away, their chirping songs stop, and the young men and women arm in arm are also startled and stop walking. A solitary person occasionally lets out a long howl—a cry of boredom.</p>
<p>Western children have all changed into brightly colored clothes, playing lively on the green grass, embellishing the business of early spring. "Moms" are pushing baby carriages, strolling on the grass, their steps so slow, their eyes looking around, looking around at the spring scenery, looking at the special pleasant complexion of the tourists in the spring breeze, watching to their heart's content, and occasionally a smile hangs unconsciously on their lips. The business of spring is exploding in every cell—the damp spring breeze is seductively blowing, blowing every cell to explode.</p>
<p>The sunlight is still so weak, but the park is already so full of business, although the various flowers still do not have any news of budding. Early spring in the French Park is truly like a young and beautiful waitress in a Parisian cafe. The waitress is to be appreciated under electric lights, and the French Park, shrouded in the pale yellow sunlight of early spring, seems even more vivid and pure, and worth cherishing.</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Strange Stone Carver <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Qiao</p>
<p>Occasionally chatting with friends, and speaking of the strange stone carver, I couldn't help but listen to it as a myth: He is a bachelor in his fifties, a Ningbo native, who has been in Shanghai for many years. All his actions are the same as ordinary people, except that when eating, he must frequently shake his head to both sides. At the same time, he raises the little fingers of both hands, rising and falling, carefully watching with his eyes on both sides. What is especially strange is that when eating, such as eating fish without spitting out the bones, and eating peanuts and melon seeds without spitting out the shells, he also enjoys it and does not feel the pain of bones pricking his throat at all.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Around <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>One year, his wife died of illness. After he took care of the funeral, he did not feel sad, and seemed very satisfied. Moreover, he bought many gifts and ran to his mother-in-law's house, whom he rarely visited. Of course, this made her very surprised. She thought: This stubborn and unapproachable son-in-law has unexpectedly come to the door today, which is something worth studying. So he explained, "The reason why I didn't come before is because you couldn't be considered my mother-in-law, because your daughter was still alive, and might be seduced by bad people, turning her back on me, then you would be someone else's mother-in-law! Now that your daughter is dead, she will naturally return to innocence from now on, so I am here today to formally recognize my mother-in-law." These words of his seem as circuitous and foolish, but he has a deep observation of the present era!</p>
<p>Now, he has been hit by the high tide of unemployment, making him a wanderer. He often lingers at the homes of some of his friends, and his friends also welcome him. At the same time, he also has an unique skill, that is, he can predict sunny and rainy weather without any mistakes. It is said that he now lives in Hongkou. If I have the opportunity, I will definitely ask my friends to accompany me to visit him for a meeting, so that I can see this strange stone hill.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Black Market in Nanjing <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Qiu</p>
<p>In Nanjing, if you mention the black market, probably no one doesn't know about it. In fact, the black market in Nanjing has a very long history!</p>
<p>The location of the black market used to be in the area of Erdao Gaojing on Fengfu Road. What about now? It has been changed to Gong Houshan in Chaotian Palace on Jianye Road. Their business hours were originally at night, and they closed the market after the sun came out. Later, in order to prevent improper trading at night, the Capital Police Department specially ordered them to change to a "flea market," from dawn until nine or ten o'clock. So the black market in Nanjing is already a misnomer.</p>
<p>The main people in the Nanjing black market can probably be said to be the garbage collectors, because there are so many garbage collectors in Nanjing. During the day, they carry garbage baskets to homes to buy old and used things, and after returning, they use some procedures to sort them out, and then bring them to the black market to sell. With this transfer, they can get a lot of profit!</p>
<p>The bargaining in the black market has a kind of code language. If you understand this code language, you can buy cheap things. Otherwise, not only will you not get a bargain, but you may even be fooled!</p>
<p>According to a garbage collector, there are probably thousands of people who rely on this black market to live, because if there is no black market, they will have nowhere to sell the things they buy! This is indeed the truth.</p>
<p>If you have nothing to do, you can often go there for a walk, perhaps you can encounter some strange things. My friend Mr. Wang once bought an ancient inkstone for the price of a string of money, but this is a matter of luck.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Xiaoxitian <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<p>Chapter 24: Valuing Beauty and Dismissing the Porter, Parting with Love; Ambitious and Strong-Footed, a Robust Man Flees to the Wilderness</p>
<p>Zhiqian pondered for a while, then suddenly jumped up and said: I don't have anything particularly important to do, but I have many friends, and I should say goodbye to them. In fact, I'm really leaving in a hurry, but my friends can forgive me. I'll write a farewell notice and publish it in the newspaper for a few days. Yourong said: That's right, a great man does things, he must be able to lift up and let go. Now that Mr. Cheng has decided to make this long journey, these small social programs can be put aside. Now Mr. Guo and Mr. Cheng are chatting with me here. Mr. Cheng can return to his room to take care of his private affairs. If you have anything to discuss before the trip, you can talk about it tonight. If there are any unfinished matters, you can handle them early tomorrow morning, and there will still be time. As he spoke, he held his chest high and his face was tight. That appearance, however, taught the people following him that they had to cheer up. Zhiqian stood up, rubbed his hands together repeatedly, and smiled: I am not worthy of the three words "great man," but I should accept County Chief Zhou's teaching of "lift up and let go." As he spoke, he happily jumped away. Eighteen hours later, it was noon the next day. At the entrance of Xiaoxitian, a long-distance bus was parked. The car was covered with a yellow canvas soft top, and a small rectangular flag was inserted on the top, which read "Western Travel Group." Inside Xiaoxitian, several people in short clothes were carrying boxes and nets to the car. Behind the luggage, a large group of people came out. Zhiqian changed into traveling clothes, covered himself with a woolen coat, held a cane in his hand, carried a camera box in one hand, his face full of smiles, and walked out among the crowd. Li Shilian, Zhang Jie, and the Director Chang of the Education Department were all closely following behind to see him off. Li Shilian walked along the way, whispering to Zhiqian: If you can't find a way in Xi'an, you'll be embarrassed to return to Jiangnan. (419)</p>
<p>Local Customs and Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e234">Anecdotes of Yuncheng <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Mingdao</p>
<p>Yuncheng, Shanxi, is a remote and secluded place, and few are familiar with its name. The local customs are simple and honest, the land is fertile, and most of the residents are engaged in agriculture. They are simple and do not interfere in external affairs. It is truly like the so-called "ideal world" described by Lao Tzu, where neighboring countries can see each other, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard, but people do not interact with each other until they die. It is no less than a paradise. A friend from there described the local customs and folkways, and there are many amusing things, so I have recorded them haphazardly as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation in Yuncheng is inconvenient. Although there is a highway to Taiyuan in the north and Tongguan in the south, the road is rugged and uneven, and cars must circle up and down the mountains. If the driver is slightly careless, it is easy to cause the disaster of being crushed to pieces. Therefore, the general public regards it as a daunting task and would rather sit in a heavy mule cart. The streets there are not very clean, and most of them are dirt roads. When it rains, the roads are full of mud, and when the weather is clear, the ash and sand hit people. Therefore, every household hangs a broom on the door, and every time they return from the street, they must take a broom and sweep their body and feet before entering the house.</p>
<p>There are many troops stationed around, but they are very friendly to the people and there is absolutely no harassment. There are few theft cases throughout the year, and there is almost a wind of not closing the doors at night. This is because every household is frugal and there are no extremely poor people, and very few outsiders come to the common land. In the market, everyone used to use silver dollars, and there were no paper bills. Now that the currency system has been changed, the sound of clinking silver coins will almost disappear. I wonder what the situation will be for the general hoarders?</p>
<p>Although education in Yuncheng is not very developed, there is also a middle school, as well as a female normal school, and there are also several elementary schools, but the level of the students is very naive, and the time for reading is from 7:00 in the morning to 9:00 at night. Except for two meals in the morning and evening, they are all reading. Most of the students read by rote, murmuring like an old woman chanting scriptures, which is very laughable.</p>
<p>The custom of valuing men over women has not yet been reformed, so women rarely interact with foreign guests on weekdays, and there are very few traces on the streets. New brides are hidden in their boudoirs all year round and cannot see outsiders for three years, otherwise they will be condemned as rude. However, women have a great opportunity for liberation around the Lantern Festival in the first month of the lunar calendar. During the three days of the tenth, fifteenth and sixteenth, the area must hang lanterns to celebrate the good night. The so-called fire tree and silver flower, the grand occasion of Jinwu's ban, can still be seen in Yuncheng. Women from all over the city flock out, crowding the streets to watch the lanterns, taking it as a pleasure. Even if they do not return late at night, they are also free to do so, but in a year, there are only these three days of leisure. The陋custom of showing off small feet is also a despicable and strange thing.</p>
<p>What is showing off small feet? The women of Yuncheng all bind their feet, just like the women of the nineteenth century. The happiness of natural feet is not available, and instead, they take pride in golden lotuses that stick to the ground, three inches narrow. Every year during the Lantern Festival, they often sit at the door during the day, stretching out their pairs of small feet, exposing them to the sunlight, which is called showing off small feet. Embroidered shoes with intricate designs, are a kind of psychology of jealousy and competition for beauty, which is laughable and pitiful. Frivolous men wander the streets, discussing and commenting on their feet for fun. Is it thin? Is it pointed? A word of praise is more glorious than luxurious clothes. If the lotus petals of a certain family's women are praised, their family will regard it as a great honor.</p>
<p>Around the Lantern Festival, there are many swing sets in the streets. People of all ages, men and women, must place themselves on the swing and swing once, thinking that they can avoid a year's disasters. However, the swing set is very high, and those who are good at it swing back and forth, flying in the air, and onlookers often clap their hands and praise. Once, an old woman lost her grip and fell from the swing set and died. Isn't this the harm of superstition?</p>
<p>There are very few folk entertainments. During the New Year, I suddenly heard that there was a movie screening in the Guandi Temple. My friend thought that this was a great opportunity not to be missed, so he hired a car with several friends and drove to the place to see the grand occasion on the screen, because it was very far away. Unexpectedly, the so-called movie was just a huge white screen on the stage. Lights were set up behind the screen, and several people held paper-cut figures, moving back and forth, making a fighting posture. Watching it was really laughable. The local men and women sat and watched, savoring it with relish. My friend couldn't help but call it a grievance and returned in annoyance. Only later did I realize that this kind of movie was originally used to please the gods. Therefore, it is called shadow play and cannot be called film, and from this "end" we can also know the local culture.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Notes on What I Saw <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— (Shijiu)</p>
<p>A certain county in eastern Zhejiang has always had a strong feudal color. A few days ago, having nothing to do, I strolled around and suddenly saw a "strange announcement" in a small shop, which was posted high on the wall, making people unable to help but laugh. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Good News　Capital News</p>
<p>Mr. X Yin X of your esteemed residence　Sincerely</p>
<p>The National Government of Nanjing orders that a certificate be issued　Having</p>
<p>Appointed Chairman of the XX Province Government　This Order</p>
<p>The characters were written in red ink. "Chairman" was mistakenly written as "Master of the Mat," which is very laughable! As for the honorable name of that gentleman, it is currently not among the provincial chairmen.</p>
<p>The announcement is yellow, and the characters are handwritten and do not exist. It is hereby declared together. Horizontally. At the top, the party and national flags are drawn crossing each other, and the shape is quite clumsy. In the second line, "simply made his name and a certain provincial seal," the character after "Yin" and the third line "He" names are all left blank. He was honored to be "Master of the Mat," so the meaning is quite literal.</p>

<p>(III) Lack of Teaching Materials and Qualified Teachers: Teaching materials are the primary tool for achieving nursing education, and suitable teaching materials can affect the fate and future of the entire nursing profession. However, China has always lacked suitable teaching materials. Even if textbooks exist, they are either translated from foreign countries, failing to adapt to the needs of China's social position, or they are outdated and full of shortcomings. Since we believe that teaching materials should be valued, we cannot ignore the issue of qualified teachers who manage these materials. Because to popularize or reform nursing education, it is necessary to rely on teachers' teaching skills to achieve practical results. However, most teachers in nursing schools are currently physicians or nurses who teach part-time. They have not received adequate teacher training and lack practical teaching skills. In addition, the heavy medical workload in the hospital and the busy work schedule prevent them from coming to class on time. The knowledge imparted to nursing students and their nursing skills are reduced invisibly. Therefore, the lack of teaching materials and qualified teachers is indeed an obstacle to the advancement of the nursing profession.</p>
<p>B. Analysis of Types of Nursing Talents</p>
<p>Nurses Who Sell Dog Meat Under the Guise of Sheep's Head: This is a common problem among male nurses in China. What does it mean to "sell dog meat under the guise of sheep's head"? It refers to male nurses who have received considerable training in the nursing profession, possess specialized nursing skills, but fail to strive to develop their careers and utilize their skills to serve society. Instead, they abandon their profession, put up a doctor's signboard, and deceive the public. We attribute this to the lack of social organization, which prevents them from achieving a stable life. For the sake of making a living and satisfying their hunger, they resort to taking risks and engaging in abnormal professions. It is hoped that the nursing school authorities will pay attention to this issue.</p>
<p>Nurses Who Seek Marriage Partners: In everyone's mind, the nursing profession is generally recognized as a specialized profession for women. Facts tell us that it is very simple: women have gentle temperaments and delicate minds, which make them more than capable of the job. Since the nursing profession is dominated by women with unique skills, why are there so few older female nurses serving society and benefiting society during the past fifty years? This raises a question that makes people wonder. The reason is that they fundamentally fail to understand the true meaning of life and the true meaning of occupational service. They do not consider their profession as a lifelong career to serve humanity forever. Once they find an ideal husband, they gradually retreat from their service vocation due to the leisure and comfort of family life and leave their profession. This cycle continues endlessly. This problem of the scarcity of elderly female nurses in China has clearly given us the correct answer. Therefore, these are nurses who seek marriage partners. However, it is hoped that female nurse comrades will think calmly and encourage the future.</p>
<p>Nurses Who Embrace Pessimism: What are nurses who embrace pessimism? They not only do not believe that China's nursing future has hope and brightness, but also believe that the entire Chinese nursing community is already doomed. They think that even if they struggle, they cannot make society recognize the importance of the nursing profession. It is better to seek a full stomach quietly, which they feel is more leisurely and comfortable. Of course, we have no possibility of refuting this, because the reality of Chinese society is before us. However, what we can answer is that China's nursing future is extremely hopeful, as long as the entire nursing community stands on a single front and works hard. If everyone contributes a bit of strength to push forward, perhaps one day the Chinese public will recognize the greatness of our nursing profession.</p>
<p>Nurses With a Sense of Failure: Although they are not absolutely pessimistic and can still acknowledge the existence of victory in the nursing future, they lack deep self-confidence. This is because they once cried out and struggled loudly for the nursing profession to achieve victory in the future, but society disappointed and discouraged them. They believe that if Chinese society cannot be improved one day, the nursing profession will never have a way out. We can say that they should continue their efforts, arouse fervent emotions, courageous spirit, and resolute will to conquer the social environment and launch the great nursing profession of China.</p>
<p>In summary, the general observation of the nursing profession and the analysis of talents clearly show us that although the Chinese nursing community has more than fifty years of history, it has not yet escaped the path of darkness. How should we start reforming the nursing profession in the future, and what is our central goal of effort? Some say that nursing education is the vanguard of reform, and we cannot deny it. However, the independence of nursing administration is the means to achieve nursing education and a necessary process to develop the basic organization of the nursing profession. From this point of view, nursing administration is the prerequisite to solving the problems of the nursing profession and the central goal of future efforts. We sincerely hope that all Chinese nurse comrades will strive together with a common will and cooperative spirit to make nursing administration independent, complete its sovereignty, and launch the glorious path of Chinese nursing.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Diphtheria Prevention <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Xingshu</p>
<p>Diphtheria is one of the most brutal diseases and the most critical of acute infectious diseases. In recent years, with the increasing convenience of transportation, the epidemic of diphtheria has become more rampant. Even in advanced countries with relatively perfect sanitary facilities, the morbidity rate of diphtheria has been gradually increasing in recent times; patients with malignant diphtheria have also increased compared to the past. Statistics from experts all prove this to be true. Our country is located in both temperate and tropical zones, and our sanitation efforts are very rudimentary. Although accurate statistical reports on the number of patients, deaths, and economic losses have not been obtained, it is easy to imagine the extent of the problem. Alas! What we hear and see tells us that our people suffer greatly from this disease.</p>
<p>Since the German scientist Behring discovered diphtheria antitoxin therapy in 1890, according to European and American statistics, the mortality rate has decreased by one-third compared to the past. However, reports from Japanese scholars show that the mortality rate still exceeds 20%. This indicates that the therapeutic effect has not reached our ideal state. This is because the timing of treatment varies, and the physical strength of patients differs. However, in recent years, the incidence of this disease has been decreasing year by year in the United States, which is the result of efforts in prevention. Therefore, advocating prevention as a comprehensive strategy is the primary task of those who seek public health.</p>
<p>There are various methods of preventing this disease. The so-called general prevention methods require healthy people to be absolutely isolated from patients with the disease. Various excreta from patients should not be placed arbitrarily but should be received in containers pre-filled with disinfectants. In addition, utensils and clothing that have come into contact with the patient may have germs attached and serve as a medium for transmission, so they must be thoroughly disinfected. In short, once a patient with this disease is discovered, it is best to send them to an infectious disease isolation hospital. If not, one should choose a room to live in to avoid close contact with many people. However, it is easy to say all this, but difficult to do. First, there are few infectious disease isolation hospitals in our country; second, the public lacks medical and health knowledge. As for subcutaneous injection of diphtheria antitoxin, the so-called passive immunization method, has been adopted for a long time. Although it can provide temporary immunity to diphtheria (i.e., not being infected), its effect lasts only three weeks. After that, there is still a risk of infection. Moreover, after once undergoing this method, there is a risk of causing allergic reactions when injecting antitoxin again. Therefore, its application is limited to times when prevention is urgently needed, such as prevention for those who care for patients, doctors, siblings, parents, family members, etc., or when there is an outbreak in schools, boarding schools, and other group living situations. In terms of its efficacy, it cannot be said to be without its flaws.</p>

<h3 id="e238">A World View of Tuberculosis Statistics (2) <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Then, what is the value of the decrease in tuberculosis mortality rates in various countries? This kind of problem cannot be strictly generalized, because tuberculosis cannot be compared identically in various countries, regions, different ethnic groups, and different ages.</p>
<p>The transmission of tuberculosis has different timeliness and aggressiveness in different regions. Due to cultural differences, the transmission may be faster or slower, earlier or later in a certain ethnic group.</p>
<p>Observing the world from the perspective of tuberculosis invasion, according to Biraud, attention should first be paid to European countries, the United States of North America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japanese cities, because in the above-mentioned regions, it is convenient to diagnose and detect the causes of tuberculosis at an early stage. In addition, cases of tuberculosis mortality that do not change or even increase include countries in Central and South America, the Indian archipelago, France, and China. Tuberculosis that has spread from Europe to Africa has mostly spread to central Africa, while tuberculosis in French North Africa and South Africa has once invaded but has now receded.</p>
<p>In the most recent century, (Rossele) Norway has maintained the lowest number of tuberculosis deaths. In 1910, Denmark had the lowest number. In 1920, the death rate in the Netherlands was even lower than in Norway. After the war, statistics from Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany showed that the death rate decreased. Recent observations show that Germany has the lowest tuberculosis death rate compared to other countries, making it the country with the fewest tuberculosis deaths in Europe and worldwide. According to the research of Greenwood and Wolff in the United Kingdom, tuberculosis death rates are inherently low in industrialized countries, but within industrialized countries, the death rates are higher in industrial areas than in other areas.</p>
<p>In his book on the reduction of tuberculosis, Dann believes that medical improvements and Lobert Koch's discoveries are equally important, making the contagiousness of tuberculosis fully understood and preventable worldwide.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis statistics in Canada are very high, possibly due to a broader understanding of the disease, especially among indigenous people. The death rate in Canada is seven and a half times higher than that of other ethnic groups, with the highest mortality occurring between the ages of ten and fourteen.</p>
<p>In British Australia, the age of tuberculosis infection is relatively late. Hone found in a hospital that only 18.2% of children around the age of thirteen had a positive Pirquet reaction.</p>
<p>The situation of tuberculosis in India is relatively bad, and the death rate is very high, with 31 cases of tuberculosis death per 10,000 people each year. The transmission process is mostly due to severe patients in cities being sent to the countryside for treatment, thereby spreading the infection widely. Public health and general conditions are very poor. Treatment centers and sanatoriums are very lacking. Furthermore, due to the lack of a national anti-tuberculosis organization, anti-tuberculosis work cannot be successful. Moreover, the bad weather makes it easier for tuberculosis bacteria to grow. Due to the lack of immunity to tuberculosis infection, the course of tuberculosis is mostly acute and severe, and mostly belongs to mixed infections, with a very large number of patients. However, the course of glandular tuberculosis, bone and joint tuberculosis, and joint tuberculosis is safer in India.</p>
<p>In Italy, the density of households in cities, the lack of large squares and gardens, and the fact that workshops are mostly too small are all major causes of tuberculosis spread, making it the most common disease among the people. In countries such as the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, the annual number of deaths is less than the number of hospital beds nationwide. In countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, the number of deaths and the number of hospital beds are almost the same. In France, there are two deaths for every hospital bed. In Italy, there are five deaths for every hospital bed. In Sardinia, not only is the public health situation very bad, but there are also many malaria cases, bad streets, and dust flying, making treatment difficult. Therefore, the tuberculosis death rate in Italy began to decrease in 1925 and continued until 1930. Statistics on pulmonary tuberculosis have decreased by 32%, and other tuberculosis has decreased by 15%. The anti-tuberculosis work was implemented by the fascist government, and in 1927, compulsory tuberculosis insurance was implemented, with excellent results. The mortality rate for Italian women between the ages of five and nineteen is very high.</p>

<p>Even those with a primary school education know that vaccination can prevent the occurrence of smallpox. The safety of vaccination and its effectiveness in preventing smallpox infection can be said to be well-known. The diphtheria automatic immunization method that I want to describe is also similar. Unfortunately, there is a lack of promoters, and the people lack understanding. What has become a past event in Europe and the United States is regarded as a novel discovery in our country. This is not only true for medical and health knowledge. Alas! I really don't know in what year and month the knowledge of diphtheria automatic immunization methods will be as widely spread in the minds of the public as vaccination is for preventing smallpox today.</p>
<p>The diphtheria automatic immunization method has been achieved after many European and American scholars have exhausted their efforts. The drug used is called anatoxin. The manufacturing method does not need to be described in this article. However, in the future, there is no need to worry about allergic reactions when injecting any antitoxin. The power to prevent the occurrence of diphtheria is also better, and the side effects are mild. It is indeed a landmark progress in diphtheria prevention methods and is worth our promotion.</p>
<p>This drug must be injected subcutaneously when applied and can be performed at any time. Statistically, children between the ages of one and seven suffer from diphtheria the most, so this age group should be vaccinated first. The more ideal approach is to administer this preventive injection to children between the ages of nine and twelve months, preferably in the spring. Because the morbidity rate of children after one year old is very high, and the disease is prevalent in the cold winter months, preventive injections in the spring allow sufficient immunity to develop, thereby avoiding illness during the diphtheria-prone winter. Moreover, according to scholars' research, it takes three to six months for immunity to form after injection, so injection should be done as early as possible.</p>
<p>This preventive method has been proven by scholars to be effective, with a long immunity time. Even after more than four years of injection, its effectiveness is still preserved, and some say that immunity can last a lifetime. However, a small number of those injected may feel pain and mild redness at the injection site, but it will disappear after a few months, with no other side effects occurring. It is not more painful than vaccination, but two injections are required.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of diphtheria antitoxin treatment cannot be denied. However, as the saying goes, "The best doctor treats the disease before it occurs." To medicate after the disease has occurred is the worst strategy. Moreover, the application of antitoxin has side effects that cannot be ignored. You all know the danger of diphtheria and the speed of its transmission, so you must hope to obtain a safe, simple, and effective prevention method to seek personal health and increase family happiness. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to general methods, performing preventive injections with anatoxin is the best way, and I sincerely recommend it.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene (82): What is Cataract? <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>Among eye diseases, there is what is called cataract. It is caused by the clouding of the lens. The color of the cloudy part is grayish-white, so it is specifically called cataract. The position of the lens is in the middle of the iris and the vitreous body. Its shape is like a convex mirror. The front is connected to the iris and the anterior chamber. The center of the front is called the anterior pole. The back is connected to the vitreous body. The center of the back is called the posterior pole. The part where the front and back surfaces meet is called the equatorial part. The lens also occupies an important position in the refraction of light and has a regulatory effect. The lens is colorless and transparent in the neonatal period. As it ages, it becomes slightly yellow. As it ages to old age, it becomes more yellow-brown. But how can the lens become cloudy and form a cataract? This is due to various reasons. The reasons are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Congenital Causes: Congenital cataract is caused by developmental disorders of the lens or by secondary eye diseases during fetal life. It can also occur during systemic diseases or nutritional disorders. And there is often a genetic relationship.</p>
<p>Age-Related Causes: Cataracts occur most often in older people around the age of 40 or 50. In ophthalmology, it is called senile cataract. The most common cataract in clinical practice is this type of senile cataract. Its true cause is still unknown. It can only be considered as a senile change.</p>
<p>Causes of Systemic Diseases: During the course of diabetes, the lens can often become cloudy. This is called diabetic cataract.</p>
<p>Causes of Complications: In cases of iritis, cyclitis, vitreous opacities, and glaucoma, the lens often becomes cloudy due to nutritional disorders. This is called complicated cataract.</p>
<p>Traumatic Causes: When foreign objects enter, surgical damage, and penetrating injuries such as cuts, stabs, and gunshot wounds occur, the lens capsule can often rupture, causing aqueous humor to enter the lens through the wound and become cloudy. This is called traumatic cataract.</p>

<p>Section 8 Surgical Treatment</p>
<p>If the artificial surgery of the patient has resulted in an effect, the situation of the changes of the lesion itself, of course, has to be determined with auscultation, percussion, and X-ray procedure. But in the clinical aspects, one can see that the coughing stops, the amount of sputum decreases, the tuberculosis bacillus disappears from the sputum, the temperature drops, the blood sedimentation reaction gradually slows down, the body weight increases, etc.; these are all characteristics of progress! Patients can understand it! The two most obvious characteristics are the temperature normalizing and the weight increasing. The longer such progress takes, the more effective it will be: Therefore, the artificial pneumothorax procedure is not to be limited in one or two times; it should be practiced over a long period. Usually, it's about a period of three months, six months, or a year, and sometimes it can last for three or four years: but if the patient has no good progress mentioned above after the surgery, then it is an exception.</p>
<p>The achievements of artificial pneumothorax for the disease have been described above, but readers should know that artificial pneumothorax is not an easy surgery. If one is not careful, and the needle breaks the pulmonary vein, it will immediately cause air embolism. This is one of the most dangerous complications. The patient will immediately fall into death, and there is no first aid method. In addition, emphysema and exudate are also very common, especially exudate is most likely to occur after surgery, accounting for almost 50%. If the amount of fluid is too large, there is a tendency to develop empyema, and the result is still incurable. Therefore, the implementation of artificial pneumothorax surgery, first, must choose an experienced doctor, and second, must be performed under X-ray fluoroscopy. Because the destination of the needle must be selected where the two leaves of the pleura are not yet healed, otherwise it will be a mistake. This layer can't be fully determined by auscultation and percussion. As for how to perform the surgery, how to install the equipment, how to pay attention to X-ray fluoroscopy, and the amount of air injected each time, etc.; these are all knowledge that experts should have, and the average patient does not need to know so much in detail, so this edition also omitted them all!</p>

<p>(Question 123) How should a toothbrush be placed after use?</p>
<p>Answer: After brushing your teeth, you should wash the toothbrush clean. It is best to wash it with boiling water, and then forcefully drain the water. Hang it in a clean, dust-free place and let it dry. In summer, to avoid mosquitoes and flies, you can find a way to cover it, but do not put it in a small, airtight box, which hinders the evaporation of water.</p>
<p>(Question 124) Can a new toothbrush be used immediately?</p>
<p>Answer: Most of the toothbrushes sold in the market have not been strictly disinfected. Sometimes the bristles are attached with anthrax bacilli, which may cause annoying infectious diseases. For the sake of caution, you should boil the newly purchased toothbrush in water for a quarter of an hour every day, and then you can use it after boiling it two or three times. At the very least, it must be soaked in boiling water.</p>
<p>(Question 125) What method should be used to remove food debris that cannot be brushed away when brushing your teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: When food debris is embedded in the middle of the teeth, you can use a toothpick to pick it out when the toothbrush can't brush it away. There is also another method, which is to use silk thread to press into the teeth and move it up and down to remove the food debris in the middle.</p>
<p>(Question 126) What points should be paid attention to when using a toothpick?</p>
<p>Answer: Improper use of toothpicks is more harmful than beneficial. The following four points should be paid attention to: Do not use metal or other hard toothpicks to pick your teeth. Toothpicks must be made of wood that is flexible and slightly elastic, and must be disinfected and polished. When using a toothpick, do not injure the gums. Most people are accustomed to using too much force and forcibly inserting it into the teeth until the gums bleed. Do not develop the habit of chewing toothpicks, so as not to injure the soft tissues in the mouth due to the tight pressure of the toothpick or the stimulation of wood chips.</p>

<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>Beyond the large headlines such as "Germany Opposes Demilitarized Zones," "French Finance Minister Raises Military Expenditure, House Passes Short-Term Loan with Unprecedented Majority," "U.S. Navy Conducts Large-Scale Exercises in Preparation for Future Wars," "Soviet Russia Deploys Strong Forces to Aigun," and "Newly Appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army, Ueda, Issues Important Inauguration Statement," we also see a piece of news that is both laughable and lamentable: "Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly Initiators Meeting Held Yesterday."</p>
<p>The so-called "Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly" is initiated by the so-called "celebrities" of this city. According to the chairman's report on the purpose of organizing the "Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly," it states: "This year is one of the most tense years in international affairs, hence the warnings from various international prophets about the possibility of a second World War. The recent international situation confirms this, and domestically, we feel a sense of multifaceted difficulties. Without making great vows, how can we hope to avert disaster? This is the purpose of this assembly. We hope that everyone present will make a collective vow to eliminate troubles in the invisible realm. The Dharma Assembly will be presided over by the Mongolian-Tibetan Grand Master Rong Zeng Kanbu and Master Chi Song."</p>
<p>Furthermore, it stipulates that there should be 95 to 145 directors and 39 to 47 executive directors.</p>
<p>What use is there for so many directors in the Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly? As one who is not a "celebrity", I cannot answer. However, judging from the range of 95 to 145 people, the scale of this "Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly" is quite large, and some hints can already be seen.</p>
<p>Speaking of large scale, we inevitably recall the "Shishi Vajra Dharma Assembly." When the "Shishi Vajra Dharma Assembly" was held, it seemed that besides "disaster relief," there were also "great vows" related to "national destiny." What has become of those "great vows" now? We still have to "make vows to hope for disaster relief," and those "great vows" related to "national destiny" have been automatically withdrawn.</p>
<p>After the "Shishi Vajra Dharma Assembly," there have been many Dharma Assemblies for "disaster relief" and "rain seeking." Even the two "Mongolian-Tibetan Grand Masters" who are going to "preside over the Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly" seem to have "presided" over quite a few. Although I am not a "celebrity" and therefore not listed among the "initiators" of each "Dharma Assembly," I cannot calculate how much "merit" has been accumulated. However, it is certain that those two "Mongolian-Tibetan Grand Masters" have "presided" over several "Dharma Assemblies."</p>
<p>Next, we naturally have to talk about the merits accumulated from the past "Dharma Assemblies." Speaking of merits, it would take too long to explain. The best way, I think, is to ask the reader to buy a map of China to take a look. It would be even better if you have yearbooks or old newspapers stored, because this way you can be clearer.</p>
<p>While people are making a lot of noise with "demilitarized zones," "raising military expenditure," and "naval fleet exercises," what kind of achievements will the Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly produce for us to see?</p>
<h3 id="e244">Graveyard <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Ge</p>
<p>The people of the village were horrified and dazed because an astonishing and strange event occurred not far from their graveyard one drizzly evening. The victim, the sentry Pan Desheng, reported to the mansion of Liu Tuanzong (Head of the Local Militia) the next morning with a bloody face and a limp.</p>
<p>"This thing, the situation, happened like this, ah, Mr. Tuanzong..." the sentry said uneasily. "It was raining, and there was not a single star in the graveyard. It was gloomy, and a nightjar was hiding on an old pine tree, calling out..."</p>
<p>Liu Tuanzong, having just woken up from a half-asleep state, leaned on a large embroidered cushion and looked at his unfortunate sentry with an impatient frown: why didn't he even wash the blood off his face? Desheng was slightly flustered, constantly wiping his forehead with his dirty sleeve, even though he didn't feel hot or stuffy. So, again...</p>
<p>"...According to the usual practice, Mr. Tuanzong, God is above, I never lie. I, following the habits of a good soldier, shouldered my gun, puffed out my chest, and ran back and forth there, guarding this road that passes through the graveyard and leads to Luoyang. Sometimes it was the nightjar wailing mournfully, sometimes it was the sound of raindrops hitting the treetops with a rustling sound; although it was so frighteningly desolate, I was not even slightly alarmed by it. Really, Mr. Tuanzong, I was not afraid... (He swallowed a mouthful of saliva with difficulty).</p>
<p>"But the rain kept getting heavier, and half of my body was soaked. So, I hid under that old pine tree, squatting down. The nightjar was always wailing so sadly, and the raindrops were always sounding so monotonously; but I was not afraid." Really, Mr. Tuanzong, I was smoking.</p>
<p>"It went on like this for quite some time, maybe twenty minutes, maybe half an hour, I can't remember clearly, in short, it went on for quite some time. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew from the graveyard, whistling loudly in the darkness. Then I saw that strange scene: a ball of fire emitting blue flames in the distance, in that graveyard shrouded in darkness. Mr. Tuanzong, you may not believe it: I was not afraid, just slightly shocked. I lifted my gun. I commanded myself in a low voice: "Ready"! But that ball of fire started moving, moving so fast. Under the light of the flames, I seemed to see a large group of disheveled shadows wriggling. (Mr. Tuanzong was greatly shocked at this time. His well-groomed, fair face slowly turned from flushed to pale.) At this time, (the sentry's dirty lips also began to tremble), Mr. Tuanzong, you may not believe it, I was still not afraid, I gripped my gun even tighter. They were still wriggling there, wriggling, chasing me closer and closer. For the sake of my duty, I shouted loudly at them: "Password"? They did not respond, just stopped for a moment, then howled sharply, as if answering me. So, I got angry and secretly commanded myself: "Fire"! The muzzle of the gun sprayed smoke, but this had no effect on them at all. They were wriggling...</p>
<p>"Finally, they reached in front of me. They were a group of naked people covered in black hair, with gleaming eyes. They surrounded me and attacked me with flames. In such a situation, even if it were a god, I believe, Mr. Tuanzong, would inevitably be slightly frightened. But I waved my bayonet and gun and fought with them. People might ask: why did you fight them? Why didn't you sneak away? Then I would answer: for my duty, sir!</p>
<p>"What happened next was what happened the second morning. I was paralyzed in a pile of graves (this fact was later confirmed to Mr. Tuanzong). The gun was gone... As for how long I fought with those demons last night, and how I was defeated, I can't remember clearly at all now...</p>
<p>Tuanzong was a believer in ghosts. He often said that he heard ghosts crying. He believed that in such a graveyard full of stacked corpses, the haunting of ghosts was inevitable and common. But what did the ghosts want with the gun? So, he yawned, waved his hand, and Desheng stepped out of the mansion.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Desheng was sitting with a strange man in a secluded corner of a small teahouse about five li away from the village, silently sipping tea. The strange man was holding the cup, lightly sipping it on his lips, then slowly putting it down: "Then you?..."</p>
<p>"Of course, I'll leave immediately. Old friend, you can imagine how uneasy I was after receiving that letter! My parents worked so hard to give me this body, but they ended up suffering from floods and hunger at home. Do you think a son can have peace of mind when he is working outside? Alas!..." Desheng replied in a low voice, tears almost dripping down.</p>
<p>"Will the regimental headquarters investigate?" The stranger asked anxiously, looking at him again.</p>
<p>"Investigate my ass, anyway, Tuanzong believed it. These two days, I will ask my brothers to tell another lie and slip away, damn it."</p>
<p>The stranger nodded, sipped the last of the tea from the cup, stood up, paid the money, and went out with Desheng. In a secluded place on the corner, he quietly handed Desheng three ten-yuan bills and said in a low voice: "It's not that I'm not friendly enough, it's just that it's only worth this much!"</p>
<p>They shook hands and parted ways.</p>
<p>A week after this incident, Desheng was assigned to guard the graveyard again. But the next day, besides a pool of blood and torn strips of gray clothing torn from his body, there was nothing else. This story is still being talked about by people with unease.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Nonsense <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— (Chui)</p>
<p>In the international situation, the Italian government first declared that it could not help France and Belgium to sanction Germany because the political basis of the Locarno Pact had been shaken by the League of Nations' resolution on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Tan Laosan said that Italy is truly very discerning. This kind of declaration has many wonderful uses: it shows that they have forcibly robbed other people's things and cannot say that they will not allow others to recover the original stolen goods; the pent-up anger from the League of Nations can be vented through this; it sends a wink to Germany and also strengthens its own position.</p>
<p>Hitler recently gave a speech in East Prussia, saying that the German nation's diplomatic policy is nothing but honor and freedom. I have also racked my brains and exhausted my strength to ensure that when any event comes, our country is well prepared and can deal with it easily. Tan Laosan said that this statement should only be allowed to be boasted by Hitler. If a pedantic scholar were to criticize it, he would definitely write the five words "sounding like gold when dropped on the ground," with every sentence striking home.</p>
<h3 id="e246">New Station <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>"Two more days, today we'll rest at Xin Station, tomorrow night we'll rely on Tongzi." Old Zhang Tou said this to the coolies around the table while eating breakfast, his face sinking, swallowing the rest of his words.</p>
<p>Following the road paved along Songkan, our smoke and dust rose. Although the road is not very magnificent in terms of construction, it undoubtedly provides great assistance to passing travelers and business operators.</p>
<p>"Fifteen streams clear the mountains, new graves in the fields where people weep, may I ask you lady why you weep, oh, my good husband!"</p>
<p>"Turtle, you old bastard!" another person cursed.</p>
<p>Affection is not limited to any class. When desire rushes into the heart, that tingling feeling teases the flames of lust, and one can't help but mutter. As the hot sun shone on our heads, they opened their throats and sang boldly.</p>
<p>"Little Ma Wu, only you know how to cause trouble, sixty li to Xin Station, buck up!" A young coolie said with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Let alone sixty, eighty is nothing in my eyes, but there's one thing, we have to rest at Xionghuang Temple for a while, so we can have a good puff, and I guarantee we'll be as fast as flying when we pick up our feet."</p>
<p>Ma Wu laughed, the coolie laughed, and everyone else laughed. "A few more puffs" deeply penetrated everyone's heart, and there was a common expectation.</p>
<p>Twenty-five li is nothing to walk on the road, so we came into contact with Xionghuang Temple.</p>
<p>On the way, it is not difficult to meet merchants coming and going, but here, it is simply a miracle. When our group's smoke and dust covered Xionghuang Temple, unexpectedly, there was another group of smoke and dust inside, preparing to break out of that gloomy encirclement. They also had dozens of coolies, and several foremen, and the goods seemed to be no less than this batch. Look, those delicate girls, holding coarse grains of rice and simple vegetables, looked dazed. How could they have imagined this scene outside of a happy family?</p>
<p>The coolies were messing around, gone, in twos and threes, all with the same hope.</p>
<p>This time, Old Tie changed his attire, tying the large bamboo hat on his back, wrapping his head tightly with a cloth, and twisting a butterfly knot on his forehead, looking like a complete hero from afar. No, once, twice, the group of people in front followed Old Tie away. As a result, Ma Wu, Mao Tou, and another person whose name I don't know disappeared. The foreman's head was hit with an iron bar, and he was anxious and jumped around, but it was useless.</p>
<p>"These turtles, if I see them, I won't beat them half to death!" the young foreman swore.</p>
<p>Time was pressing, not allowing for a long stay. The person responsible for this was naturally unable to shirk responsibility. The young foreman temporarily grabbed a temporary worker to shoulder the flower basket, and Old Zhang Tou, who was over sixty, put the lighter rattan basket on his head.</p>
<p>Being a foreman is not easy. One must be able to attract people, and be able to subdue people to listen to orders. To become a master in the trade, one must accept all kinds of tempers. Now, although the treatment is better, Old Zhang looked at his beard at this old age. If the coolies escape, he will have to pick up this heavy burden himself! Saying this, he sighed.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the young foreman finally broke the deadlock—</p>
<p>"You can't treat them with kindness. They will definitely stay at Xin Station tonight. We'll go there to find out."</p>
<p>The load was on Old Zhang's shoulders, his back was sweating, dripping straight down, his left arm swaying!</p>
<p>"Green grass flowers in front..." Like other coolies, he also chanted the usual jargon on the mountain road.</p>

<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>Starting from Muzha, going out of Shimat, is this boundless desert, at least eighty or so li to Kulun.</p>
<p>There are no mountains or water here, only Kees Fu and his travel companion - the camel - on a stretch of sand.</p>
<p>- The sky is gloomy, and there is no sign of habitation all around. Travelers and livestock are hurrying on their way -</p>
<p>Sarala - a huge wind swept in from the front, and a mass of soil the size of a black pile fell in front of me.</p>
<p>The camel is also old, and it used to be unafraid of these things. This year, it has encountered storms and desert waves, and it is simply a little afraid, and cannot catch up! Its hooves are sinking into the sand, as if they have taken root, and it cannot get up.</p>
<p>"Old beast! You have enough provisions, why can't you catch up? Humph! Getting worse every year......!" Kees Fu was a little angry, cursing fiercely.</p>
<p>But the animal ignored him.</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>The sky became even gloomier, and the desert waves rose and fell, connecting and sounding again. Even Kees Fu was a little worried...</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that animal will fall!"</p>
<p>He looked at the sky, sighed, and a stream of hot air rushed from his lips, passing through the top of his head, and gradually condensing into water droplets on that leather earmuff, as if about to drip down.</p>
<p>Cold, not the first day it's been cold today, hey! I, Kees Fu, have grown up in this desert since I was a child, and I don't know how many years have passed.</p>
<p>He thought about the past, and became refreshed and proud, so the two lives continued on their way......;</p>
<p>Sarala - a layer of sand was rolled up, luckily it was still a step late, and he almost buried himself, but Kees Fu's eyes were already covered with a lot of fine sand, he held his breath, and simply stopped his steps, put down the bag of dry food and the whip in his hand, bent his head down, and only cared about stripping off the sleeve of his left hand, and skillfully stretched out his finger to wipe his eyelids for a while, then stepped up his pace, rushed to the front of the camel, grabbed the rope, and walked slowly.</p>
<p>The storm was still howling, and the desert waves were rising and falling even more violently. The old, useless animal was panting and could barely move forward, so its body softened and it dropped its front hooves, looked at Kees Fu, raised its head, and kept pouring out a lot of food from its food bag, its upper teeth tilted against its lower jaw, as if chewing casually.</p>
<p>After licking for a while, it still didn't move on, and Kees Fu seemed to be impatient.</p>
<p>"Old beast! Get up......"</p>
<p>He wanted to raise his whip to strike, but seeing the bags of heavy objects on its back, and its walking unsteadily with difficulty, he seemed to soften automatically with some reluctance.</p>
<p>Oh! Can't embarrass it! Eight or ten years ago, it was so helpful, and earned me a lot of money. The upper tribe borrowed it to help with logistics work to defend against enemy soldiers, eh! Don't despise it, it has also been to the front line. When it came back from the front, everyone said it was good, and could rush forward all day long without resting. But it's been three years! It's useless now. If it goes to the front line again, I'm afraid it won't be as energetic as before, and maybe it will be sent into the hands of the soldiers. No, I won't let it go...... No...... No......"</p>
<p>Kees Fu became kind, and showed a face of harmony. He expressed sympathy to the old travel companion, muttering to himself while shaking his head, loosening the rope in his hand, and tidying up the goods and luggage.</p>
<p>The gloomy sky never clears, and there is no sign of habitation all around. Travelers and livestock are hurrying on their way........</p>
<p>Sarala - the storm is still howling, and the desert leaves a track like a long snake, sending off two travelers in the desert........</p>

<p>Opening "Contentment in Poverty"</p>
<p>Coarse rice vegetables, stir-fried with white salt, are only enough to fill the belly. If you seek extravagance and greed for delicacies, there will be all kinds of mountain and sea delicacies. Ragged clothes are priceless and practical, patched up and patched up year after year. Thinking of filling boxes and cabinets for others to store, how can you have everything to wear until old age? Although it is only, a hard wooden bed with soft grass, I find it carefree and happy. Brocade quilts and embroidered bedding cannot sleep, tossing and turning until dawn. Old houses, just sweep, and repair them in time so they don't collapse. A thatched roof that doesn't leak is better than a tiled roof, with clear breeze and bright moon without restraint. People in the world don't know the happiness of contentment in poverty, busy and bustling all day long, working east and west for fame and fortune, for whom are you toiling and for whom are you busy? Try to see how many great rich people, are they still all well today? Isn't it a lifetime of empty labor.</p>
<p>Xing Ruiting's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Shanghai (1100) 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Dog Racing Track"</p>
<p>Shanghai is the number one prosperous place. There is dog racing all night long. How many young and wealthy children spend thousands of gold to buy dogs and compete with each other. They rely on their dog slaves to train them to be strong and healthy, and they can perform on the track. When they are temporarily locked in the cage, they only ask the dogs to bark Wang Wang. I only see the horses and dragons and the water and the people. They are like buying tickets and competing to dig up five oceans. One, four, two, three depend on the guests to pick. Greedily, they throw everything away and leave empty bags. Suddenly, they hear the bell ringing, and the group of people looks at the enclosure. The electric rabbit tries to run around, and the cage door opens and the dogs enter the track. Only to see that the rabbit is first and the dogs are behind, the machine starts quickly, and the dogs gallop without giving up. What is most hateful is that they suddenly fight and bite each other halfway, and there is no hope of winning, so the dogs stagger. The championship is won by others, and some people sit aside disheartened, with all the banknotes in their pockets lost.</p>

<h3 id="e253">About "The Story of Louis Pasteur" <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>A Great Man on the Silver Screen Plays a Great Man in the World of Science</p>
<p>When "The Story of Louis Pasteur" was being filmed, an old-fashioned barber's chair suddenly appeared in the bedroom of Paul Muni, the lead actor in the film. The movie star was not using the chair as a sleeping device; he was using it for makeup purposes because the real Paul Muni was not like Pasteur in the film. His hair was shorter, his face was thinner, and he had no beard. Therefore, every morning, he had to spend at least two hours putting on makeup, turning himself into a Pasteur who was indistinguishable from the real Pasteur, before he could go to the set to work. The film details the life of Louis Pasteur, the great man in the scientific world and the benefactor of all mankind. He fearlessly defied the wrath of the king and the cold ridicule of the great gentlemen, boldly pierced the veil of life and death, and declared war on the invisible public enemy of mankind. For the happiness of Parisian women and the happiness of all mankind, he desperately fought against those invisible murderous demons. These bad things had gradually invaded the beautiful French women from the sewers of Paris. It is said that the film has passed the censorship notice and will soon be released at the Grand Theater.</p>

<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>The female lead in Wang Cilong's directed film, "Father and Son Heroes," has been decided to be Miss Zheng Mengxia, an expert in song and dance. She is a singer and dancer in the play, that is, a female bandit leader, and also the most important character in the whole play. However, with her superior dance skills, rich acting experience, and willingness to work hard for art, there is no doubt that she will be able to perform her duties satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The Central Photography Studio's "Warrior" will be released soon. Liang Saizhu's old lover "Hart" is one of the protagonists, so a photo is published here to let those who have not seen Hart meet him.</p>

<h3 id="e256">News of the Establishment of the First Branch of Chongsheng <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The new song and opera organization in this city—Chongsheng Society, has been established for less than a month. Due to the soundness of the organization, the number of people registering to join is exceptionally enthusiastic, so the society's affairs are thriving. The society originally planned to hold its first performance at the end of March, but it was delayed for a long time due to a request from a certain National Arts Research Society to perform at its one-week anniversary celebration.</p>
<p>Now, in order to facilitate the participation of young people in the central district who love opera art, it has been specially agreed with the authorities of the American School Entrance Examination at No. 45, Hele Lane, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Parker Road, to provide assistance in establishing the first branch in the school. Mr. Xin Zijun, a member of the society, will serve as the director of the branch, in charge of recruiting members and carrying out affairs for the branch, starting today.</p>
<p>Men and women comrades who love opera art are welcome to join. Brochures are available upon request.</p>
<p>In addition, the society is preparing to publish a "Chongsheng" type of daily newspaper, which was published on the 22nd. The contents include Mr. Fei Si's "The Inevitability of the Emergence of 'National Defense Drama'," Mr. Liu Yawei's "The So-Called Chinese Radio Drama," and news of the regular performances of "Roar, China," etc. It is available at all newsstands for two copper coins per copy.</p>
