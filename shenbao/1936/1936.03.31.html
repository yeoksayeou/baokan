<p>許多公認爲反對國社黨者、亦因一時不愼、而投贊助希氏票、或出於步隨大衆之故、亦有因覺責當輔助德國在外交政策上取共同陣綫而投贊助希氏票者、許多人對於希氏所發以榮譽維護和平之保證、當然信之不疑也、</p>

<h3>英法比軍事接洽　英國展期討論　先由關係各部大臣審議</h3>

<h3>法衆改選運動第一聲　佛蘭亭演說外交政策</h3>
<p>準備參加任何和平談判</p>
<p>但以恢復國際法爲基礎</p>
<p>巴黎　外交部長佛蘭亭、本日午後六時在伊沃納省維土萊地方選舉集會中、發表關於外交政策之重要演說、略謂「任何談判、凡是使和平結搆、臻於穩固者、法國莫不準備參加、惟以國際法治制度、回復常態、而談判基礎、切實可靠、爲其先决條件、希特勒元首最初所提和平建議、性質寬泛、不切實際、吾人原望其在迭决演說中、有所補充、以資糾正、詎意希特勒所反復說明者、僅有一點殊爲重要、卽以所謂德國人民永久的生存權利興條的之價值、兩相對峙、所令人失望者、卽此是也、夫法俄互助公的、是吾與羅卡諾公的相牴觸一項問題、德國旣拒絕提交海牙國際法庭裁决、而又主張應在國內爲所欲爲、不容他人置喙其間、吾人因此自當在原則與事實上提出兩項問題、</p>
<p>德國若果保留權利、對於任何條約、均得藉口萬世不朽之大綱大法、或德國人民之生存權利而加以廢止、則今後各種條約、復有何種價值乎、</p>
<p>他日與德國簽訂新條的之後、若果發生爭執、則在德國心目中、究有何種裁判機關、符合獨立與公正之條件、而可加以承認乎、總而言之、德國對於國際生活、崇尚强力、而世界其他各國、則惟公理是尚、此兩觀念、背道而馳、固彰彰明甚也、希特勒現爲這應時局需要起見、乃在外交方面、力事宣傳、和平兩字、長在口頭、自稱欲爲歐洲籌劃廿五年之和平、甚至謂他日或將興法國樹立永久和平制度吾人於此、又不禁提出問題曰、德國忽忽派兵開駐萊茵河非武裝區域、并在該處建造防禦工事、此其用意、卽爲籌劃和平歟、此項設施、果對何國而發乎、其目的安在乎、夫希特勒旣堅稱和平係屬必要、則其所謂德國人民之生存權利、以及平等權利、果何所指、是宜加以明白界說者也、</p>
<p>至是、佛蘭亭追述去年一月十三日薩爾區域公民投票結果之後、希特勒曾謂法德兩國之間、從此無復領土爭執、并對羅卡諾公的之義務、重予申明、言猶在耳、「此際希特勒是吾擬俟適宜時機、以德國人民主權完整爲口實、而對但澤自由市之制度、引起問題乎、希特勒又向立陶宛提議訂立不侵犯公的、此其意義、是吾確定接受米美爾自治區域之制度、抑或故作狡獪、以爲日後暴力行動及達的事實預留地步乎、凡此種種問題、吾人均有要求希特勒明白答復之權、蓋若德國將凡爾賽條的各項結果全部推翻、吾人坐視不問、不令其切實答復、則希特勒卽可引發自誇矣、」</p>
<p>述及德國關於殖民地平等權利所提要求、謂、「德國所要求歸還者、究係歐戰前殖民地之全部、抑或一部份乎、苟係一部份、則爲何部乎、又希特勒他日是吾擬以發展德國人民生存權利爲名、欲爲德國建設殖民帝國、卽使妨害其他民族、亦所不顧乎、若然、則此項帝國、當在何處建設、而所妨害者、又爲何國乎、」</p>
<p>佛蘭亭述及希特勒所提締結二十五年互不侵犯公的之議、謂、「和平爲一整個而不可分析者、彼雙方互不侵犯公的、安足以槪括之、設有侵略國焉、同時與數國訂有雙方互不侵犯公約、及其欲向甲國行使攻擊、卽可於適當時機、廣止興該國所訂之互不侵犯公的、以逞共謀、而其與乙丙等國所訂公的、則仍予維持、資爲護符果爾、則乙丙等國受其拘束、自不能參加集體行動、於是侵略國乃可高枕無憂矣、夫集體行動之目的、係在維護各項條的、俾爲人所尊重、并使各國不論大小强弱、均得享受安全、今希特勒提議之用意、若在阻止集體行動之實施、則由此而樹立之新制度、結果所眉、徒使侵略國無虞受懲、而其準備戰事、較易爲力而已、且也今當希特勒向全世界呼籲和來之際、而在奧國丹麥屬石勒斯維省、（戰前屬德、）今一部份爲丹麥所有、）波蘭屬西萊集省、（戰前亦屬德國）、捷克之德國少數民族間、甚至在瑞士境內、德國民族住居之部份、國社黨之宣傳運動、反有變本加厲之槪、此層殊有重大意義存焉、德國蓄志併吞此等地方、吸收此等地方之居民者久矣、今將拋棄此念歟、抑將公然宣示於世、謂此乃德國民族內部之事、而非他國所能置喙其間者歟、此一問題、然耶吾耶、願希特勒有以語我、」</p>
<p>佛蘭亭之結論謂、希特勒如準備開誠佈公、作一通盤解釋、則對於上述各項問題、宜一一答復之、「希特勒所提出之和平計劃、是吾眞實可靠、全歐洲與全世界、現均亟欲知其底蘊、至在法國、則所主張者、一爲在國聯會機構內、以互助之方式、組織更較完備之集體安全制度、一爲尊重條約、其有時移境易、今昔情形不同者、得採取合法之修正程序、俾資調整、一爲安全制度、一經實施、則廣大之裁軍計畫當卽隨之實現、吾人茲已决心爲樹立眞正與持久之和平而工作、其有慣施狡獪以和平爲假面具、醞釀新糾紛與戰爭者、則吾人亦决當揭發其奸謀也」云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>保甲運動的重要和推行（中）</h3>
<p>內政部警政司司長李松風</p>
<p>從推動地方自治方面觀察——要一個國家存在，必須人民有組織，要建立一個現代國家，允必須人民有行使政權的知識和能力。行使政權的知識能力，是需要訓練的。現在我們所採用的自治制度，一方是以它爲地方的基礎組織，一方也是用它來訓練人民行使政構的。所以必要以自治是吾完成，爲施行憲政與吾的標準。在達到憲政的途程中，無論如何，我們對於地方自治的推進，是不能放鬆的；但是怎樣推進？我們必嬰研究最好的方法。爲什麽已經推行七年地方自治還沒有多大效果呢？主要的原因，可以說是與民眾迫切的要求未能够適合。——因爲政權行使的慾望，在生活安定之後纔能發生，假如秩序不導，人民不得安居樂業，推行自治當然是不容易的事了。所以我們要推行自治必須先從安定社會秩序下手。根據上面講的保甲旣然是保衛治安的工具，如果推行有效，自然有助於自治的推進。反過來講，如果保甲運動不能成功，社會治安也不易恢復、那末完成地方自治簡直是夢想了！</p>
<p>從完成生產建設方面觀察——中國的衰弱，產業不振爲其主因；所以要想復興中國，必須從生產建設上着手。如何從事生產建設？這是需要全國人民共同努力的；不過努力生產建設，也必定嬰有一個組織來負賣推動，那也最好莫過於「保甲」了。譬如改良農業生產方法，組織各種合作，修築道路，疏濬河流積毅備荒……等事業，保甲都可以負責辦理的；而且由它辦理也容易收效。近來各省常有利用大批徵工，完成築堤（譬如去年的蘇北大堤）疏河等偉大工程，其最大的原因，就是因爲有嚴密的保甲組織。現在各省正在推行的勞動服務，也是生產建設的一個步騾，在這個步驟裏，仍然是不能離開保甲組織的。於此也可見保甲與生產建設關係的重要了。</p>
<p>從推進民眾敎育方面觀察——中國敎育不普及，爲一切事業推行困難的總因；所以普及敎育，允其是民眾敎育實在是當務之急·但是要普遍推行，又不是一件容易的事！我們如果能把民衆敎育利用保甲來推行，便也很容易生效。因爲保甲組織，旣然人人都要參加，而且與人人都有密切關係，如果使保甲長兼任推行社會敎育的責任，一定是容易生效的。而且這種社會敎育，也可以利用保甲訓練的方式來實施，使每一個人都不能例外。保甲訓練成功，也就連帶的收得社會敎育的效果。這從社會敎育方面來看，不能不說是經濟而有效的方法。近來有些地方正在進行設立「保學」，把學校與保甲作成密切聯系，這是很值得注意的事情。</p>
<p>從便利政令推行方面觀察——有人說，過去的政治組織是大頭小尾的，我們以爲實在可以說是有頭無尾的，也就是有上層無基礎的。譬如一個政令，由中央政府而省政府，而縣政府，便算到了最後機關；最多也不過由縣政府轉達到各警察區，根本到不了人民身上。就令是照例出張佈吿，以中國一般敎育情形，能認識的有多少？認識而又注意佈吿的，又有多少？這樣有頭無尾的組織，要說政令能推行盡利，那實在有點疑問！有了保甲以後怎樣呢？三縣而下到區，到保，到甲，一直到戶，而達於各個人；這樣政令的傳達到了它最後的歸宿，纔眞能談到政令推行的效果。譬如即以徵工爲例，如果沒有保甲組織，必須縣政府自爲分配，如果不來，又耍縣政府負責再分別催徵；不但縣政府人少事繁難以担任，而且因爲監督不過，效果也一定不良。但是有了保甲組織，只要分配於各保各甲，便由各保甲自己負責來分配，管理監督，並可互相監視，收效便是很容易的了。</p>
<p>以上不過是擇幾件比較重要的事項來說明保甲的重要性；因爲保甲的功能是多方面的，所以應該說明的還很多，惟因時間關係，在這裏不再細舉了。</p>
<p>三，保甲運動的推行</p>
<p>保甲運動應該怎樣推行呢？這不是一件簡單的事，它的範圍牽涉很廣。不過，我們以爲制度，人員，事業，經費這四點，是比較最重要的。以下我們就這四點分開來講一講：</p>
<p>一，合理制度的樹立——要想保甲運動容易收效，必須先求保甲制度本身的盡善盡美，一個不合理的制度，縱令你如何努力，也是不容易推行的。合理的保甲制度，應該怎樣確立呢？我以爲最重要的有下列各點：</p>
<p>（甲）性質要確定——且保甲的性質，直到現在爲止，似乎還未會確定；有人說它完全是自衛的組織，有人說它是自治組織的一部分，有人說保甲不過是應變的組織，叉有人說保甲和自治組織可以永久並行不悖……眾說紛紜，當然是因保甲性質不確定所致，我以爲若不能把保甲性質早日確定，這是推行保甲上最大的障礙。怎樣確定呢？我以爲最好是照內政部的意見，把保甲乾脆併入自治組織之內，代替閭鄰。作爲鄉鎮區下的編制，確定保甲的性質爲目治的一部分。道樣名正言順，推行一定可以比較順利。</p>
<p>（乙）系統要明自——現行保甲制度，在剿匪區內各省，都是甲隸於保，保絲於區，區絲於縣，各保之間並得組織聯保。其他各省，有保隸於鄉鎮，轉屬於區於縣的，有保甲隸於鄕鎭，鄉鎮轉屬於縣的；也有把聯保作爲固定組織，以爲區及保甲的中間組織的，更有把保以上組成聯保，大保，而隸於縣的；……辦法旣不統一，系統亦欠分明，實在有統一釐整的必要，我以爲最好是按照縣自治法草案所規定的組織，縣以下就是鄉鎭區一級，在鄉鎭區內的編制，就是保和甲，保以上不設聯保，它的任務可以由鄉鎭區來辦理：鄉鎭區的範圍，可以伸縮。其結果就成了縣——鄉鎭區——保——甲，系統是簡單明瞭的。至於鄉鎭區單位過多，縣政府難於監督，則不妨另在縣以下分設行政區（體區署）以爲救濟，不必算在自治組織之內。　（未完）</p>

<h3>藝術漫談　繪事後素</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>子夏問曰：「巧笑倩兮，美目盼兮，素以爲絢兮。」何謂也？』子曰：「繪事後素。』曰：「禮後乎？」子曰：『起予者商也。始可與言詩已矣。』</p>
<p>孔子欲對子夏說明「人須先有美質然後可加文飾」之理，却用「繪事後素」來比方。孔子自已說「多能鄙事，」也許他對於繪畫也很擅長，深知個中甘苦，所以乾脆地說出這四個字來作比方。</p>
<p>「繪事後紫，」就是說先有了白地子然後可以描畫。這分明是中國畫特有的情形。這句話說給西洋人聽是不容易被理解的。因爲他們的畫，在文藝復興前以壁畫（Fresco）爲主，在文藝復興後以油畫爲主，兩者都是不必需要白地子的。</p>
<p>所謂Fresco，是用膠汁和粉的一種水彩畫法。大都畫在壁上，故不妨就稱之爲壁畫。文藝復興以前，歐洲基督敎勢力盛大。盡家所描的題材幾乎全是宗敎畫。最偉大的繪畫事業是寺院裏的壁聲。文藝復興時雖然油畫巳經發明還有許多大畫家盛用Fresco書法，爲寺院作壁畫。像米侃期琪洛（Michael　Angelo）便是最著名之一人。這種畫法頗有缺點，一則揮寫不自由；一則膠性失去後，容易龜裂或脫落，不便保存。所以在文藝復興之交，就有人另外發明一種油畫。共法以油調類料，隨時可以自由竄改，乾燥後又很堅牢，利於保存。於是Fresco就讓位於油畫。近數百年來，主宰西洋畫界的顔料，惟是油畫。這兩種顏料，因爲都是和着粉的，故不透明，都有掩覆性。紅的地子上可以塗上綠的，黑的地子上可以塗上白的。誇張地說，這種書法，同油漆匠漆板壁一般。那顔料好比油漆，（且竟是調鉛粉的油漆；若換了中國漆，仍有些兒透明，遮不住木紋。）那書筆好比漆帚。再誇張一點說，這種書法同泥水工砌牆壁一般。那顔料好比石灰泥，那畫筆好比泥刀。所以西洋畫的地子，不一定要求白。橫豎顏料都是厚厚的，有掩覆性；而且把畫面全部塗抹，不留一點空地子，故地子的色彩不成問題，甚麽都可以。現今中國的畫學生們也在那裏用油畫塗抹。試看他們所用的畫布，大都作暗黃色，或者淡靑灰色。新派畫法中雖然也有模仿中國的「繪事後素，而在油畫布上留出一些空地子的，但是不很自然，實行的人也極稀少。總之，西洋的「繪事，」在工具上，在技法上，都是不必「後素」的。</p>
<p>反之，中國給事以必須「後素。」素紙在中國繪畫上，不僅是一個地子而已，其實在繪畫的表現上担當着極重要的任務。請看中國畫，大都着墨不多，甚或寥寥數筆。寥寥數筆以外的白地，决不是等閒的廢紙，在畫的布局上常有着巧妙的效用。這叫做「空，」空然後有「生氣。」昔人論詩文曰：「凡詩文好處，全在於「空。」譬如一室之內，人之所遊息焉。息焉者，省「空」處也。若窒而塞之，雖金玉滿堂，而無放此身處，叉安見富貴之樂耶？鐘不空則啞矣。耳不空則聾矣。』這等聲喻在中國畫上很可通用。某外國漫畫家諷刺商人云：有商人請某大畫家作一立幅，送潤資六十元。取畫一看，長長的立幅下面只描着參差的三粒豆，上面靠邊寫一行題字，此外都是白紙。商人在算盤上「三一三十一」地一算，說。。「一粒豆値二十元，行情太貴！」這話雖說是諷刺無知的商人的，一方面也在諷刺中國書。長立幅中聲三粒豆，無乃言過其實；但孤另地畫兩株白菜，或數隻小雞，或一塊石頭，確是中國畫中所常見的。總之，中國畫的畫面，大都着墨少而空地多，與西洋油畫的滿面塗抹者全異其趣。西洋也有水彩畫，描在素地的紙上的。但是因爲畫法相異，塗抹得厲害，所留空地遠不及中國畫之多。而且有時水彩顏料裏也通行展白粉，成爲有掩覆性的，一朶一朶地塗上去。况且這在西洋畫中，比較起油畫來只算一種小道，不是可以代表西洋繪畫的。</p>
<p>繪事的「後素」與不「後素，」在藝術上有甚麽差異呢？據我看，後素的更富有畫意。所謂「畫意，」就是「藝術味，」淺明地說：就是「不冒充實物，而坦白地表明牠是一張盡。」畫中物象的周圍，照事實論，一定要有東西。桌子也好，牆壁也好，天空也好，總之，事實上應該有一種東西，這叫做「背景」（Background）。西洋畫是忠於實際的，凡畫必有背景，背景也是搆圖的一部分。他們所以要把書面全部塗抹，便是爲此。中國畫反是，畫大都沒有背景，而讓物象掛在空中。一塊石頭，或是一枝蘭花，或是一個美人，都懸空掛着。他們的四周全是紙的素地。這好似無邊的白雲中，突然顯出着一種現象。所以這種現象給人目的刺激很强。這分明表白牠不是實物，而是一幅「盡。」回顧西洋盡就不然，寫實派的油畫，工筆細描，描得同實物完全一樣。那種油畫肖像倘使掛在房間的暗角落裏，陌生人看見了或將向他點頭拱手，還要請敎尊姓大名呢。這辦法近於「冒充實物，」這種畫不像一張「畫，」不像一個「藝術品。」故講到「畫意，」「藝術味，」中國畫比西洋畫豐富得多。</p>
<p>孔子說「繪事後素，」乃言人必須先有美質，然後可加文飾，猶繪畫之必須先有「素地，」然後可施「彩色。我想：素地上若不施彩色而僅用黑色，照上面的道理說，應該更富「畫意，」更富「藝術味。」所以在中國畫中，「墨畫」的地位很高。山水，梅，蘭，竹，石……自來不乏墨畫的名作。根本地想：繪畫旣不欲冒充實物，原不妨屛除彩色而用黑墨。照色彩法之理：黑是紅黃藍三原色等量混和而成，其中三原色俱足。拿俱足三原色的黑色來描在完全不吸收三原色的白色的素地上，色彩的配合非常飽和，色彩的對比非常强烈，本來可以不借別的彩色的帮助了。</p>
<p>最近蘇聯拿到上海來展覽的那種木版畫，聽說上海人士對牠們頗有好評。有人讚牠「有力」，有人讀牠「有生命，」還有人讚牠是「革命的。」我沒有看過，不好說話。但知版畫是素地上印黑色的繪畫，是「墨畫」的同類。料想牠不是希圖冒充實物的繪畫，而是富有「畫意」與「藝術味」的作品。——版畫在中國，千年前早已流行。在西洋則發達於近代。這可說是東洋風的畫法。這樣看來，「繪事後素」完全是東洋畫特有的辦法，但現已廣播於西歐，行將普及於全世界了。</p>
<p>孔子說「繪事後素」，是用描畫的「必須先有素地，然後可施色彩」來比方人生的「必須先有美質，然後可加文飾。」一民族的文化，往往有血脈聯通，形成一貫的現象，西洋的繪事不必「後素，」使我懷疑西洋的人生不必先有美質，而可全部用文飾來遮掩。美質是精神的，文飾是技巧的。東西洋文化的歧異，大槪就在於此。</p>

<h3>工部局　樂隊存廢問題</h3>
<p>本年樂隊預算僅足前五月之用　如須繼續納稅人應負籌欵之責</p>
<p>向例每年春季四月、爲中外納稅人舉行年會、推舉董事委員之期、而工部局音樂隊之應存應廢、俱經歷年討論、久爲中外人士所注意、茲特將該樂隊過去之歷史、與存廢討論之經過、以及目前之地位等、縷述如下、以供關心者之研究、</p>
<p>民樂隊改組擴大而成、市民樂隊係私人舉辦、嗣以經費不足、請由工部局接受承辦、遂成爲公立之團體、此事發生於一八八一年、根據於納稅人年會之決議、自此之後、該樂隊之處置、悉聽納稅人之主張、至一九二三年及一九二七年、納稅人舉行年會之時、均曾有修改預算案、以期廢止樂隊之提議、但均經否決、至一九三四年、工部局董事會之大多數、感於當前經濟危機之迫切、議決將樂隊之經費問題、提出於納稅人年會、並由總董建議、於年內積極籌備樂隊之廢止、惟此議仍不獲通過、至去年復有納稅人主張將該樂隊改由私人團體承辦、而由工部局給以每年不得超過十五萬元之津貼、自始至終、工部局對於樂隊之存在與否、悉聽納稅人之處置、惟去年之建議、仍經反對而罷、此前此屢議屢輟之情形也、</p>
<p>去年該樂隊總指導曾向董事會提出辭呈、由董事會批准、自十月三十一日生效、後工部局音樂委員會、復有小組委員會之成立、考察樂隊行政改進事宜、尤注重總指導行政與音樂職務之界分、不久董事會復命音樂委員會調查該樂隊之可否改組、以期節省經費、或應否保留與現有形態相似之樂隊、</p>
<p>據音樂小組委員會主張、樂隊改組之辦法、內有交響性管絃樂隊一、及鋼器樂隊一、人員方面有總指導一人、副指導一人、鋼器樂隊隊長一人、及其他樂師四十四人、樂隊人員任用之後、不得享受工部局其他人員所享受之各項利益、其聘任合同復有如下之規定、　任期規定一年、所有合同悉於同一日期屆滿、以期樂隊全體之繼續及效能、得維持至服務最後之一日、　合同不再繼續之通告、無論出自局方或樂隊人員、悉依樂師之等級、規定一月至三月後生效、　樂隊人員應依其等級在第一年任期之中、每月扣除期薪水百分之五、以至百分之十、作爲工部局維持之一種基金、並作爲隊員履行合同之保證、該項扣除之欵、可於最後退職之時、連同利息、一併發還、　每個任期之中、得享受假期一月、以上所云改組後之樂隊、每年費用約須二十萬元之譜、而現有樂隊每年費用、但在三十萬元左右也、再者據小組委員會所表示之意見、此項改組之樂隊、與現有者相較、可毫元遜色、</p>
<p>嗣工部局董事會於討論此問題之時、除決定倘音樂　隊必須保留者、應按照小組音樂委員會之主張、加以改組一項之外、深覺　工部局樂隊之前途、不慶由董事會自動處置之、而應遵照前例、由納稅人自由定奪之、　爲便利納稅人既決定完全廢止或改組之後、施行其決議起見、現有樂隊樂師之合同、應預定與納稅人年會舉行日期相近之時、以爲屆滿之日、　認定本年五月三十一日爲最適當之日、　倘納稅人決定願維持與現有人數相等之樂隊者、此項樂隊、應依照小組音樂委員會所建議之辦法組織之、以上各項均已經工部局董事會通過矣、</p>
<p>再者去年九月中、已經提出辭呈之樂隊總指導、經局方挽留之後、亦已同意暫時繼續服務、至本年五月終爲止、</p>
<p>再則關於此後樂隊經費問題、倘納稅人必欲繼續維持樂隊之存在者、此後經費、亦應由納稅人籌措之、蓋本年所規定之預算案中、關于工部局樂隊一項者（計爲十二萬六千五百元）僅足集中營本年一月至五月終之用也、</p>

<h3>鬧市捕盜彈如雨下　行儿死傷十三名</h3>
<p>大新街九江路一帶呈極度恐慌狀態　一匪在四馬路中彈被擒兩巡捕受傷</p>
<p>福州路於昨日下午七時五十分發生刦案一起、當時捕房探員巡捕均持槍追趕、沿途開槍、逐五六十響、當場擒獲一匪、傷巡捕兩名、惟路人被流彈所傷者、竟達十三人之多、茲將各情分誌於后</p>
<p>密謀捕盜</p>
<p>福建路第一百零八號王泰豐百貨商號、於本月二十五號晚七時十五分許、曾被盗匪光顧、當被刦去鈔洋角鈔等約十元左右、事後該號即投捕房報告、請求追緝、經探員等連日偵查、姑悉該批匪徒時常往永安公司天韻樓密謀、惟以不辨案犯面貌、乃於昨日下午七時左右、特往王泰豐商號通知該號夥友、約定時間、會集天韻樓、以便辨認、實施逮捕、</p>
<p>兩客詭秘</p>
<p>不意探員正與夥友等密談設計之際、該號夥友突然瞥見該號門首有身穿藍布長衫男子一名、及身穿黑布長衫男子兩名、頭上各戴呢帽、在該號門首盤桓不去、時或探首張望望、形跡詭秘、夥友等以前車可鑒、早具戒心、乃私告探員、及待探員返身察探、則該男子等似有覺察、即假裝安閑態度、點首口哨而去、探員知非善類、亟紧步走出該號、追踪不捨、</p>
<p>刦鐘錶店</p>
<p>該三男子自離開王泰豐號后、即沿石路北行、折至福州路、且行且語、似在密談、待行至福州路第四百七十七號李永昌鐘錶店時、該三人即聯袂而入、於是探員等即遙立對街大觀園菜館門察、静觀動靜、眼見該三男子一進店堂、即由一穿藍布及一黑布長衫男子摸出手槍對準店中各黟友禁止聲張、一面由一身穿黑布長衫徒手匪徒、走進帳房間、抽開櫃屜、開始搶刦、</p>
<p>一盜飲彈</p>
<p>當斯時該處行人、以瞥見大觀園門首有人呆立觀望、意為有甚奇事異聞、因此不期而停步者二十餘人、店中匪徒、亦被驚覺、知事不妙、乃即招呼該持鈔二十餘元之徒手匪徒、慌忙退出、一出店門、探員即由對道衝出、瞥見該持鈔匪徒向西飛奔、乃亟拔槍向其開放、擊中匪徒心部、立即倒於尚潔廬浴堂弄口、先被擒獲、</p>
<p>眾槍齊發</p>
<p>但尚有持槍匪徒兩名、則已於斯時向東奔逃、沿石路向北、探員乃急返身、狂吹警笛、會同附近華印崗捕飛步追趕、兩匪見勢危急、即開槍拒捕、於是探捕亦眾槍齊發、一時子彈橫飛、聲如連珠、兩匪且戰且逃、惟恐中彈、即朝西折入漢口路逃至大新街、再向北、斯時適有老閘捕房西探鮑台等走差、巡經該處、目睹斯狀，乃即恊同兜捕、</p>
<p>街頭混亂</p>
<p>匪徒見南北兩端、已均有探捕逼來、且彈如雨下、急切間無從擇路、乃挨身沿路商號牆壁下由大新街折往九江路向東直奔、探捕等於是亦追踪而入九江路、同時南京路方面崗捕、亦前來恊緝、因此槍聲更密、沿途行人、大起紛擾、商店莊號咸如大刦將臨、莫不爭先恐後、緊閉大門、而一般慌忙無主者、惟恐受累、但又一時無處躲避、竟至哭笑不得、獨立街頭、静待命運之判斷、</p>
<p>兩捕中彈</p>
<p>因經此絕大之紛擾與恐怖、該兩匪徒不知如何、竟被於嘈雜紛亂之人羣中、在九江路福建路口突然失踪、探捕等以目標已失、槍聲方始停息、總計前後雙方所用手槍、計達五六十響之多、且匪徒轉折經過馬路凡四處、而又事起倉卒、兜捕間沿途人頭亂竄、皂白難分、致被流彈傷害之沿途行人、竟達十三名之眾、除一匪被擒外、尚有華捕兩名中彈、</p>
<p>茶房慘死</p>
<p>至身中一彈而倒於尚潔廬浴堂弄口之匪、身穿褐色綫春駝絨長袍、年約卅歲左右、於車送醫院後、即氣絕身死、刦賊尚在身畔、尚有九江路第五百六十六號天仙茶園第四號茶房陳有祥、年卅二歲、以適在門首兌換銅元、被流彈擊穿太陽穴、奔至狀元樓門首、即倒入該樓店堂中、事後送往醫院救治、以傷重斃命、屍體已轉送騐屍所待騐、</p>
<p>三人重傷　至於重傷方面、計有三人、內中有一女性、名雷金氏、年二十五歲、江北人、家住新記浜路尚賢里二十五號、在福建路中彈、傷在背部、波及前胸、勢甚危殆、一名周福金、年十九崴、廣東人、家住法租界鄭家木橋中華里、業成衣、在福建路受傷、彈中右腿、一名劉富生、年六十歲、向業報販、在福建路嘉禾旅館門首受傷、彈中大腿均甚劇、</p>
<p>輕傷九人</p>
<p>尚有輕傷九人、一徐忠震、年二十六歲、二薛平素、年三十一歲、三唐保羅、年十四歲、四陳甫青、年三十三歲、五馬棠海、年二十三歲、六姚祖郎、年三十歲、七伍青萬、年十八歲、八鄒貴卿、年二十五歲、時報工人、九徐中廣、年卅一歲、均在大新街間受傷、且均彈中足部、或僅被子彈擦傷、故經醫院包紮後即出院、至於受傷兩名華捕、一為二九七二號、一係三三零八號、均隸老閘捕房、傷在左右腿、已送工部局醫院診治、同時尚有福建路第二三一號萬昌衣莊及湖北路二七八號大同西服號門首玻璃窗、各有一塊被彈擊破、幸未傷人、當時激戰之烈、於此可見一斑、至於在逃兩匪、刻下正在恊力緝捕、想終難逃法網也、</p>

<h3>蔣大沂演講　王壁山遺址文化時代（二）</h3>
<p>遺址之現狀　遺址的上面、有土城殘留的痕跡、土城的西面、因爲道路的通過、房屋的建築墓葬的累積等種種原因、破壞的力量較大、所對殘留的痕跡較少、止有靠南邊的一小部份、還有城頭殘留、大部份已無從和地面辨別的了、城的東面、情形要比西面爲好、除提了通衢所經和通衢北首一座廟宇的地方、城垣已被夷爲平地外、其他部份、大致尚看得清楚、城的南面、城裏和城垣上高高低低散佈着無數的墓葬、但我們從城外看去、則高出地面上的城垣痕跡、卻很明晰、城的北面、比較上是城垣形跡最明顯的一方面、在榛葬之中、依舊可見雉堞高低、兀立在地面上、其最高的部份、有達十來尺高的、斷斷續續、像幾座小土山、故這地方便得了王壁山之名、</p>
<p>城內、隨處可以拾到古代陶器和磁器的碎片、這種碎片、不僅在土城內可以拾得、土城外附近的河灘上也時有存在、遠至石湖西岸的治平寺門前也還有、記得今年一月十七日的上午、鄙人和曹葉丹先生侍嘉善張天放師到那邊去調查的時候、還在那個地方拾到過一座殘破的古瓦登、這很可能推見當時城內城外都有人居住、在那裏、所以城裏城外都有人類活動痕跡存在、</p>
<p>據前清同治間的吳縣圖圖上說、王壁山係元土不毛、祗可築墓、所以這地方在以前是不適宜於耕種的、這地方所以不適宜於耕種、有兩種原因、㈡地面較鄰近爲高、　地下互礫太多、凡是人類居住的地方、因防範潮濕的侵襲、常會將他們的住址逐漸墊高、凡是人類居住的地方、因爲舊建築和舊器皿的新陳代謝、常會使瓦礫增多、王壁山地方的不適宜耕種、實在因爲在地下有一個蘊藏極豐富的遺址之故、現在情形、較之以前已略有不同、那高亢而多瓦礫的地方、已被勤力的農民、不惜工本、逐漸開墾爲稻田了、但是沒有開墾的高地、依舊很多、</p>
<h3>民立女子中學廿九週年紀念</h3>
<p>本市文廟路民立女子中學、歷史悠久、爲本市私立女子中學之巨擘、負笈該校之學生有八百餘人、昨爲該校創立二十九週年紀念日、上午九時在該校大禮堂舉行紀念大會、出席全體教職員、學生九百餘人、由校長童行白主席、夏煥新司儀、行禮如儀後、首山主席報告該校略史、次由教務主任何成甫訓育主任賴志文、總務主任範明堯等相繼演說、勉勵諸同學在此國難時期、應加意爲國家社會個人努力、俾造成本校更光榮的歷史、同時該校第一一四三團童子軍由團長夏煥新領導行升旗典禮、旋即禮成繼續舉行遊藝會、節目非常精彩、完全由該校師生擔任表演、有話劇平劇歌舞口琴獨奏、笙獨奏滑稽等等、至下午三時始表演完畢、盛極一時云、</p>
<p>學校調查</p>
<h3>上海法國學校概況（一）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>上海法租界公董局在滬設立西童中小學兩所：一所在環龍路十一號，稱法國學堂；一所在雷米路二百號，稱雷米小學。法國學堂創立於西歷一九一一年，距今已有二十五年之歷史；一切學校設施均臻完備。雷米小學則係於三年前開辦，規模較小，內部正待發展；且所收學生均爲俄僑子女。是以本文敘述各節多以法國學堂之設施爲依據。本文承法公董局教育處學務監督高博愛君暨法國學堂校長紀爾孟君多方供給材料，至爲感謝！</p>
<p>一、富有國際性的學校</p>
<p>法國學堂原名French　Municipal　College，應譯爲法租界公董局立西童中學；現爲簡便計，沿用今名。英文College是大學學院的意思；而法文College則指中學而言。法國中學修業年限是七年，而小學則只有五年；所以合併起來中小學修業年限仍是十二年。該校附設有小學暨幼稚園，學制系統堪稱完備。該校最初在一九一一年創立時是在霞飛路二百四十七號；那時全校學生人數只有八十人。現在該校中小學各級完備，到本學期全校學生人數已增加到四百三十人。該校係男女同學；現有男生一百九十人；女生二百四十人。</p>
<p>據法公董局教育處學務監督高博愛先生的意見，該校的最大特點就是富有國際性。該校的入學兒童包括二十六國的國籍；校內一切的訓教設施亦以國際的觀點爲目標。一九三一年各國聯教育考察團法國團員法蘭西大學教授郎吉梵氏（P·Langevin）曾去該校參觀，對於該校實施富有國際性質的教育亦曾深爲讚許。關於該校的訓教設施容在後幾節敘述，現在先將該校所有各國國籍兒童的人數調查抄錄如后：</p>
<p>法國兒童　一六九人　德國兒童　二人</p>
<p>中國兒童　三九人　美國兒童　八人</p>
<p>英國兒童　一一人　安南兒童　二人</p>
<p>阿真廷兒童　一人　阿米利亞兒童　三人</p>
<p>奧國兒童　一人　比利時兒童　二人</p>
<p>加拿大兒童　一人　多米利加兒童　一人</p>
<p>西班牙兒童　一人　希臘兒童　五人</p>

<p>愛沙尼亞兒童　二人　烏拉圭兒童　二人</p>
<p>瑞士兒童　三人　敘利亞兒童　三人</p>
<p>二十六國兒童合計　四三〇人</p>

<h3>紗花　現紗花銷路均見良好</h3>
<p>紗棉紗現銷漸形活躍、華南一帶頗見生色、同時海外花紗狀况、一律轉趨高翔、人心提起、靑島紗價亦有回漲三四元之消息、故市場人氣更爲挺秀、但紗布倉庫中之存紗、則仍無流動能力、極準紗花因本月份辦理交割手續停市、查現紗各帮買去統計一千〇十包、售價漲五角、至一元云、</p>
<p>棉現棉市况略形良好、以外棉趨高、但廠揣尚未大量發展、火機花四十九元半、東棉進五百包、抵解怡和、脫子棉六十二元半、公大廠進一百七十四件、現貨送廠、</p>

<h3>期花交割四萬六千担</h3>
<p>三月期標花、於去年十月一日上場、價爲三十二元允角半、其時適值華北水災劇烈、棉田遭殃、新棉產額大受打擊、且估計屢决减少、人心漸漸轉向看漲、市價更入穩途、後以紗銷不暢、廠需欠佳、繼以美棉報吿、產量雖增、而市價安定、同時國內棉產不佳、加之歐洲局勢杌隍不寗、意阿戰雲瀰漫、美棉三品花均趨高翔、至十一月四日財部公佈實施紙幣改革、是日頭盤橫跳三元、穿破四十元外、十二月叫日、頂高峰達四十五元半、迨後以年關之故、且美棉遠期亦已敲破一角關口、印棉步跌二十餘羅比、市價乃挫、至本年二月八日、叉見四十元〇五分、旋經銀行界吸收不放、且採逢低購進主義、復見重升、最後一盤爲四十三元九角半、較之上場價激漲十一元、結果待交割者共餘四萬六千担、比上月减少一萬二千六百担、交割價以最後三日統扯、爲四十四元、較之上月漲三元、交貨品以靈實花爲大宗、其决天津美種·漢口細絨·漢口粗絨等、聞日商東棉收進一萬五千担、其餘套利者頗多、交貨方面、則以棉商漢口上海帮居多、茲將收交兩方經紀人商號及收貨內容列下、（單位担）</p>

<h3>棉紗成交六萬餘包</h3>
<p>本埠近來棉紗棉布消費之發展、誠爲近年來所未有、自一月下旬至本月中旬、叉爲暢旺、售價連日奔騰不止、內地購買力意外堅强、但至下旬則轉趨萎靡、市價亦復超趄不前、茲將二月及三月兩個月間、本埠中日棉紗現貨成交、各帮購買數量列下、（單位包）</p>
<p>二月　三月上旬　六、八九八　一〇、七〇三中旬　一四、七八五　一七、三六九下旬　一三、二〇九　三、一一三合計　三三、八九二　三一、一八五</p>
<p>即二月爲三萬三千八百九十二包、三月爲三萬一千一百八十五包、至二十七日爲止、合計六萬五千〇七十七包、其中大都爲天津帮及內地帮所購買、</p>
<p>日紡商似已出賣七月份、洋行方面賣與華商數量、連同現貨及遠期貨在內、約五·六萬包、</p>
<p>至於棉布一項、紡織業已準備至五月間、大的四月閒當可售罄也、洋行售興華商的三·四萬左右、查此番紗布活躍之原因、　以現爲春銷需要時期、故銷路發達、是其主要原因、　從前匯兌·摽金·公債等、本埠金融投資業之遊資甚巨、此項市塲今已完全呆滯、故咸轉向紗花及棉布市塲活動矣、</p>
<h3>孟買棉花出口上週較清</h3>
<p>上週市况狹小而堅、主要交易、均在四五月期白羅溪花、出口商之套額、一部份移至七八月期、出口交易較靜、日本需嬰本極活勸、惜因國內股市及紗市不振、亦轉靜寂、大陸平常、蘭開夏成交較暢、大部份爲長絨花、因價廉之故、陸續吸收、現貨塲中之交易、輸出商爲主要買戶、附錄上週統計於下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>三品紗花均漲</h3>
<p>三十日大阪電、三品本日僅半日交易、期紗漲一元一角至五角、近月爲一百九十三元五角、遠月爲一百九十叫元九角、期棉漲四角五分至九角五分、近月爲六十三元四角、遠月爲六十一元二角、</p>
<h3>糧食　傳洋麥已有一船進口　標粉浮多脫手而疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩後疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近小二角、遠小四分、開價時、因業外買戶仍陸續吸進、交易雖不甚暢、市面則略穩固、較前週末微好七厘半、以後市呈盤旋、出入無幾、迨至下午開盤、本月份巳爲最後幾盤、以實銷已少抽動、結局反較上午小去一分、六月份以下、則傳廠家前定洋麥、會有一船進口、故人心見虛、浮多說手、較上午回落一二分不專、惟國內新麥登場尚遠、人心尚難過分衝動云、</p>
<p>廿八日收價　三十日收價　上落三月　三·四〇一五　三·三九七五　跌〇·〇〇五〇四月　三·三九二五　漲〇·〇〇五〇六月　三·二五）　三·一二五〇　…………七月　三·〇三七五　跌〇·〇一二五八月　三·〇五三〇　三·〇五二〇　跌〇·〇〇五〇天氣晴暖…洋麥報疲</p>
<h3>期麥內地人心看小</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份大致轉平、以洋麥始終報疲、天時仍見晴暢、內地人心、未免看疲、惟交易未暢、出入無多、迨至下午開盤、交易更淸、市少上落、因陳貨已經停拍、新貨則待新麥登場、故此後交易、一時難期發展耳、現麥市面、交易尚暢、價仍穩固、開山東瑤灣麥五元三角半、江北麥五元三角二分、由福新去三千包、阜豐去五百包云、本麥　廿八日收價　三十日收價　比較六月　四·五五　四·五四　跌〇·〇一七月　四·四五　四·四四　〇·〇一八月　四五五　四·五二　〇·〇三</p>

<h3>厚早粳到稀價見定立</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到三十餘號、（貨共六千餘石、）內中仍以薄稻爲多、且連朝剩貨亦厚、而包胃更見淸淡、天津大運二帮共祇辦一千五六百包、故薄稻市續跌角外、厚早粳本街銷塲亦呆、惟幸貨稀、尚見定立、杜洋尖及陰變元仍屬平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船二十餘號、市上各貨去胃、白粳淸呆、中决價小一角左右、常帮特白粳未開、薄稻價小六七分、陰元價小一元、變元價短五六分、羊杜埠秈短近尺、客失去路呆滯、價短三四分、其餘各米、均帶軟勢、</p>
<h3>客秈市面有步升之象</h3>
<p>本街續有銷路</p>
<p>昨日客秈到頭、續有長江與浙東各埠裝到、但到銷兩平、市面巳得定局、昨日除本街繼續應酬外、略有小戶囤買吸收江西機米、故市面又形轉俏之象、如今明再有整批容囤問津、則後市或須步砌、因目下各產地限制甚嚴、成本已昂、而洋米除中次之碎米外、其他概不通劃、因此市面已易呈漲難跌之現狀矣、昨日開出江西米千〇五十包、　台米九百包、江北米五百包、沙市米二百包、　　米彔一百包、除　戶去贑米一千多包外。均由本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>豆油漲風復熾</h3>
<p>豆油市况、因國際風雲日緊、恐一旦爆發勢將碍及來源、故人心步步看高、牛莊油曾開二十一）故其貸市價、雖一度回落、但不久卽邁步前進矣、大連油比較上旬之最高峰。祇差二解難、昨市開二十元零一角、輪船牛莊油開二十元零九角、本油廠爲二十元零二角、大連岐山油爲二十元、又不汀五六天出貸爲十九元九角、其勢尚屬緊張云、</p>
<h3>黃豆市况績見俏俐</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、惟牛莊業已開凍、路貨可到、而市價反績見俏俐、其故實係牛莊產價昂貴、運到見遲、然本市沒餅價格、逐步緊提、原籽看漲、故昨榨油廠及內地車坊辦胃暢旺、市價得以高翔、比較上週漲起二角、計開濫　河豆一千餘包、蚌埠豆二車、訂明天交四平街豆八車、一星期交通遼豆十九車、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白成交轉旺</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢仍平、惟關金已見微緊、轉機關鍵或即在此、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨二十二元、比小五分、轉口貨六元九角八分、比小二分、均有成交、東赤無更動、東白步小一角至五分、四號現貨二十二元、轉口七元〇五分、八號二十一元六角半、轉口六元六角半、九號二十一元四角、轉口六元四角半、本廠綿白振記一號二十元六角、不動、下檔復以底薄見增、二號二十元四角、三號二角、四號二十元、五號十九元八角、號貨國產靑亦白糖均未續開、祗開出宏發茹粉百餘包、價為十元、比升二角、</p>
<p>糖業合作公司、昨屆標兌之期、五羊粗白計市新順德東莞等廠出品共額一萬一千二百四十六包、價開二十一元八角半、比小五分、成交七千五百四十包、曲溪廠出品一千一百十包、二十一元六角半、亦小五分、成交二百包、二號綿白一千三百九十二包、二十一元一角、四號又七百八十五包、二十元九角、各成交一百包、市新廠中砂白一千包、二十元六角、比小一角、成交三千包、</p>

<h3>雜項　百合片到存兩缺　產地貨少！市盤繼漲</h3>
<p>百合片產於浙之湖州、銷路以廣東為多、其次如北了帮營口大連等處、亦有去胃、今年因存底不厚、曾由十八元升至二十餘元、邇來到存俱缺、復由二十六元漲至二十八元、前後漲度已達十元、查往年最小價僅九元許、然現價雖高、聞產區存底將罄、而銷令尙長、或將漲至三十餘元、百合粉亦隨漲云、</p>
<h3>一年來之金融（八）</h3>
<p>— 何伯雄</p>
<p>各行美人凖備充足，市場信用，日益鞏固。　內地人民使用鈔票之習慣，日益養成，同時農村現金外流之結果，現貨籌碼缺乏，亦不得不以鈔票為支付之工具。　廢兩改元之結果，零星兩付款，往昔須以本票或支票支付者，現則改用銀行鈔票。　多數銀行對於鈔票之推行，又是甚為努力。茲該一年來各行鈔券發行額。列表於下（註十二），以窺大槪，然後尙須稍加銓釋。</p>
<p>民國二十四年上海華商銀行發行額（單位元）</p>
<p>鈔券與拆息有互爲因果之關係，籌碼浮多時，則拆息低落：籌碼緊縮時，則拆息騰昂，但一年來上海市塲發券額之增減，對於拆息之漲落，似乎未見多大關聯，換言之，即發券不能調節拆息。試將，表與第二節之拆息市價變低落。例如三月份之發行額僅爲三萬六千九百萬元，而拆息最低竟有六分，最高亦不過一角，發鈔額增多之時，拆息反而高昂，例如十一月份之發鈔額已增至五萬五千六百餘萬元，而拆息則爲二角之高率，最低尙須一角二分。</p>
<p>惟檢查去年來上海各銀行紙幣發行狀況，中央銀行有驚人之進步，十一月份，該行發行額增至一萬五千另八十九萬二千九百十四元、試觀下表、</p>
<p>最近上海各銀行發行額百分比較表</p>
<p>自去年十一月三日財部規定中，中，交三行，鈔票爲法幣後，其他各商業銀行之鈔票，須一律歸發行，準備管理委員會接收，故至去年年底爲止。大致業已接收就緒，計中央銀行接收中國農商及中國通商二家，交通銀行接收中國實業，中國　業，及浙江興業三家。嗣後除中，中，交三行外，均無檢查報告矣。至本節在前所列十一月份各行發行總額，及爲中國銀行經濟研究所搜集各該行截止三日以前之數字也。</p>
<p>上海票據交換額及錢業公單收解額，至足表示市面之盛衰，惟票據交換所於二十一年三月始成立，資格較淺，尙未能與錢業公單分庭表以代參考：（註十四）</p>
<p>民國二十四年上海票據交換額及公單收解額（單位千元）</p>
<p>上海各月銀錢業，票據交換數，苟與前年逐月同期比較，則去年每月均减退五萬萬或四萬萬元之數額之钜，可見去年工商業之不振，以及金融業之呆滯，比往年尤劇也。（未完）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳建鉅）</p>
<p>假如月亮能够變成一面明鏡，從裏面可以看出地球上的一切，東北同胞的呻吟慘狀，明顯的映在每個人的眼前，那麽五分鐘愛國熱度，也許可以延長，「醉生夢死」「麻木不仁」的人，也許可以撩起一絲愛國的情緒</p>
<p>一個人戴上了「唯利」的眼鏡，看不出世間有什麽「正義」「同情」，在「唯利者」的辭典中，只有「掠奪」「榨取」等字眼的存在。</p>
<p>髮絲粗細的草芽，也能衝出堅硬不過的地殼，求生力量的偉大，於此可見一斑了。</p>
<p>人生最討厭的是「平凡」，因爲在「平凡」的生活裹，造就不出特殊的人來；而且「平凡」生活，過膩了覺得索然寡味，必須遍嘗甜酸苦辣，才能眞正領略到人生滋味。</p>
<h3>滑稽的報復方法</h3>
<p>— 萸譯</p>
<p>現在意大利的茶室中沒有茶了，備給主顧喝的只是一種香草水。香草水是以伊利特里亞出產的一種適口的香草所泡製的，被認爲忠實的愛國者應喝的飮料。伊利特里亞是意屬的東非殖民地，殖民地的出產品可算是國貨，茶却是英屬印度的出產品，英國主張制裁意大利最激烈者，當然要報復，要抵制英國貨。咖啡可以吃的，因爲咖啡是從巴西運來的，巴西並不在批准制裁的聯盟中的。同時，良好的意大利國民接到一種警吿，就穿着英國製造的衣服就是犯了叛逆罪。</p>
<p>類似這種的事情在國際關係萬分緊張的時期中是很普通的。在巴安爾戰爭發生的時候，法國的輿論表示不滿，在報紙上對於英國加以嚴厲的攻繫。有一個英國人拿起斧頭把他的一張餐桌劈碎，因爲這張餐桌上塗的是法國光漆，他一時的義憤塡膺，便遷怒到塗法國光漆的餐桌上去了。依此類推，那麼假使有一個意大利人，在無綫電收音機裏，收得了英國廣播的音樂歌曲，他便要把收音機搗毀，不打成粉碎不足以發洩盡他胸中的憤氣。至於講到收聽廣播無錢電，在任何情形之中，對於獨裁政權統治下生活的人民是一種危險的嗜好。最近有兩個德國人判罰做四年苦工，因爲收聽了莫斯科廣播的無綫電和參加了政治的討論。</p>
<h3>男女同學</h3>
<p>— 逸民</p>
<p>講到「男女同學」這椿事情，從前也經過許多人們的提倡和贊成，才有這「男女同學」的事實，不過，是在反對空氣極濃厚之下產生的。其實男子進校爲讀書，女子進校也是爲讀書，又何用其反對和贊成？眞要怪一般人們太好管閒事了。</p>
<p>但據×天晚上×女士的報吿，我覺得「男女同學」，多少有些異樣。</p>
<p>伊說：「男女同學，有些不自由，一舉一動，都要受拘束，允其是我們女同學，偶然不注意，不免要多惹事體。那些男同學，最喜歡和我們女同學尋開心，做鬼臉，皺眉頭，眨白眼，……醜態百出，眞是弄得我們要呌媽媽。有一决，在上課時候，有一個男同學，將粉筆頭丢在我臉上，一决，二决，三决，……接運丢了十幾决，不過，一點不痛，所以我就拿定「不睬主義，」結果，粉筆頭，也就不在臉上打筋斗了。但是，也有些好處，假使我們要呌那些男同學做什麽事，他們眞是馴服得像一隻小山羊，呌他怎樣，他就怎樣，他老不願意違背的。這個，使我們女同學，感覺十分便當，像我在女校中時，是從來沒受到這樣的福氣。」</p>
<h3>闢路交通的建設</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我聽了這位×女士的、一席話，於是我也就覺得「男女同學」也好，「男女不同學」也好，贊成也好，不贊成也好。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飲恨千秋</p>
<p>他坐下來先笑着說：你這些日子，心境不怎麽好吧？我搖搖頭說；這倒無所謂，住了這高大的洋房子，吃的飯，還有兩菜一湯，衣服穿在身上呢，也不曾凍着，人生在世，不過如此，我還有什麽心境不好。蘭厂笑說：我們都有那點書呆氣，家無半畝憂天下的。加之你的眷屬，都在北平，你急於要北上，而環境又不許可你北上，你常然是心裏不安。我坐在寫字檯邊，把桌上一面小鏡子拿起來，自照了一照，覺得是個中年以上的人了於是向蘭厂笑着說：蘭兄，我們是同年的人，但看你丯度翩翩，還不失爲一個少年的樣子，我是老了。蘭厂笑說：我正在勸你，你還只管發牢騷。我今天到道裏來，沒有別的事，蘇州公園中不日將舉行一個金魚菊花展覽會，想邀你去看看。我聽了這話，抬起一隻手來，搔搔我蓬亂的頭髮，含着笑，表示出我那鑄躇的樣子來。他完全了解我的意思了。笑說：我想着你在這個時候，或者沒有那閑情逸致。不過我原來的目的，是嬰供給你一些小說材料。我笑說：條蘇州這地方，去過的人是太多了。說着我在桌上烟筒裏取了一枝烟捲，雙手遞了過去。我也取了一技烟，仰靠在寫字椅上抽着。蘭厂架了腿，坐在我對面沙發上，他將烟校伸到茶几上的烟缸外，把一個食指勾着慢慢的，彈去烟枝上的灰，這就笑道：當然，不是要你採取蘇州作背景，去作一部小說。更不是在魚菊展覽上，說你能取得什麽材料。現時在我蘇州家裏，放着我朋友的一本日記，還有我朋友的女友，留下來的一點作品，可以讓你盡一日之力，在我家裹，把那些文件全數看看，有不大懂的還可以問我，這豈不是一些很好的小說材料嗎？我笑說，呵！關於男女問題的，而且是你的朋友，一定不錯。但是你旣有這許多材料供給我，帶到上海來，讓我看上一遍，不就完了嗎？爲什麼要我來回奔跑幾百里路？蘭厂說：若是能够帶來，我今天就帶來了，可是我受人家託付之重，不能不把那些柬西看重，我挾着一個皮包，挾來挾去，也許把人家東西給丟了。老實吿訴你罷，我把這些東西存在家裏，謹謹愼愼保藏在我個人讀書的書房中，不說生疏一點的人，不能看到弗些文件，就是我那間屋子，也很不容易進去的。（一）</p>
<p>舊話</p>
<h3>刑趣錄</h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>太平天國遠離現今將近百年，其刑法自更不免有所謂斬首示衆一條了！那手續是用竹筐盛放了斬下的首級，由二個兵丁扛着筐子，一個兵士鳴着金　，大聲的喝喊：「某某人犯了那一罪，在此斬首示衆了！」他們往各處走了一遍，纔把那顆首級埋了。爲着和姦案，是必有男女二顆首級一併給扛着遊行的。强姦案，也是兵士們扛着首級，其後須敎那個被姦的婦女跟隨着走。照例，婦女們自巳還須大聲報吿着：「某某人爲强姦了我，如今斬首示衆了！」但有要顧及自己顏面的，伊們大都只是低頭跟着行走，不肯運例叫喚着。這宜布罪狀之責只得偏勞那個鳴鑼的兵丁了。</p>
<p>前淸專制時代，婦女們也得跪在官府案下受審。一言不合，大老爺發起怒來，也要賞下一頓肉板子沒得還價的可是娘兒們畢竟多數要害羞的，——忍痛還在其次——要伊們當衆褪褲，露出肉體來挨板子時。伊們總是逡巡哀求，挨延着這難堪之境。差役們雖然多數是强兇霸道慣了的，况又事關奉上差遣，可以用强制執行的手段，又畢竟礙於男女間禮敎之大防，一時便感得非常爲難了！那麽，逢到這等情形之際，老公事的差役們便會施展出他們的能爲來了；——多份是出於老先生的傳授。那個差役上前一步，湊近伊耳旁低聲說道：「還是爽快些，請你自己動手罷。這麽着挨延下去，大老爺會加多你的板子，終不免我們來服待你。如果差役動手褪下犯婦的褲腰來，那個犯婦便該給他睡上一决的，這是老規矩。我們當差役的伸手去伺候犯婦辦這件事，最是認爲觸霉頭，非得那麽破解一下不可的。你又何苦來？」那班可憐的女娘們聽他這一番軟中帶硬的話頭——騙功，沒有一個不發急着，沒奈何只得含羞帶愧，委委曲曲地褪露出伊的臀部來，忍受那板責的肉刑了！</p>
<p>三國時，蜀國忽然大旱，朝命禁酒，定法造酒者辦罪。吏役們弄法，侵入人家搜得了釀具，就辦他們與造酒者同罪。一時有很多人家，爲了家有久年間置着的釀具，偶失檢點，便遭橫禍的。一天，昭德將軍簡雍跟着劉先主微服出行過市，他忽然舉手遙指着一個行路的男子，吿訴先主道：「這人要行淫，何不拘辦他？」先主說：「什麼你識得的？」簡雍回道：「他身懷淫具，和家藏釀具無異」先主大笑，就命解除了苛禁。</p>
<h3>剝猪玀</h3>
<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>最近，看見一張「剝猪玀」的諷刺畫：一個流氓拿了一管手槍，指着一個土老兒，他嚇慌，就把外衣脫給那流氓；可是那流氓拿了外衣，還是把手槍指着他，他又把內衣脫給那流氓了；那流氓拿了內衣，仍然把手槍指着他，他連把褲子都脫給那流氓了；然而，那流氓雖然地把他的全身財產拿到手，而他的手槍却還是指着他，一直逼他到河灘邊，把他的性命送死了</p>
<p>這土老兒，滿以爲那流氓拿到了外衣就會走的，因此，他就一再退讓了，而結果，他把全身的衣着都給了那流氓，而那流氓的慾壑却始終沒有滿足，以致最後，把他的性命都送給那流氓了。</p>
<p>如是這土老兒一碰見那個流氓，就很敏捷勇敢地把他攻襲下來，那末，這流氓不但不敢再動手，恐怕運逃也來不及了。可是這土老兒要退讓，結果，不但送掉了衣著，而且還送掉了生命，更且還落着了一個「猪玀」的醜名。</p>
<p>然而，這十老兒對待那「剝猪玀」流氓的畏縮怯懦和退讓，而結果終至於做了死「猪玀」，那眞是「猪玀」的所以爲「猪玀」了。</p>
<p>不願做「猪玀」的朋友，看了這一張「剝猪玀」的諷刺畫後，當有所殷鑒罷！</p>
<h3>静夜</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>我自從由蒲石路搬住到麥賽爾蒂羅路後，環境是比較從前幽靜得多了，晚上再沒有那些呌賣者的聲浪，也沒有那些車輛的喧囂，我可以不患失眠而能早早入夢了。</p>
<p>這應該對於我的精神很有裨益的，可是在某一天的夜晚，我做了一個可怕的夢，——夢見我沉淪在陰森的地獄中，——我從夢中驚醒來，我的心在餘悸中跳躍着，我張開眼睛是無邊的黑暗，我聳起耳朵是無限的沉寂，我想找尋一錢光明或者一點聲音，使我得到些安慰，證明我不是在地獄裏而是仍然活在世界上。但結果使我失望了：黑暗中一點也看不見甚麽，沉寂中一點也聽不見甚麼，就連我桌上時計的聲音也聽不見了！</p>
<p>當我的靈魂陷在死滅的靜夜和迷惘的幻夢中的時候，——我懷疑我是「死了的活人」或者是「活着的死人」的時候，突然有一陣急促的車鈴聲從遠處駛來，這是救火車的鈴聲，這粗大的鈴聲把凝結住的靜夜立刻打破，也把我心上的死寂打破了。</p>

<h3>「眠不得」</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>——解鈴還是繫鈴人　心病祇需心藥醫——</p>
<p>話要交代淸楚，眠不得的意思，是睡不着覺，直截爽快地說，就是失眠</p>
<p>失眠二字，是吾源出中土，抑係來自東籍，手邊缺乏參考書，無從查考。但睡不着覺的現象，確是古已有之了。詩經關睢章：「……窈窕淑女，寤寐求之；求之不得，寤寐思服；悠哉悠哉，輾轉反側……」數千年前，男子追求女子，單相思不成功，失戀，就得了失眠症。李陸報蘇武書：「……塞外草衰，夜不能寐。……」那時將軍李，羈身漠北，審懷故國，威念身世，得了失眠症。唐人詩句：「……春色惱人眠不得，……」這位詩人，大槪看見春來百卉榮，細柳搖靑，杏花烟暖，蝶翩翩，鳥嚶嚶，風光旖旎的時候，找不到一位異性，給他發洩密意幽情，因爲性的煩悶，也得了失眠症。敝人腹儉，舉不出許多例子，但準此也可知道，失眠一症，不一定是摩登產見，文明結晶，我們的老祖宗早就犯了這種毛病。</p>
<p>我們需耍睡覺，與需要飲食有同樣的急迫。俗語說得好：「日求三餐，夜求一宿。」一宿，就是能够得睡覺的意思。德國也有一句諺語：「健全之睡眠，足抵日食之半。」面孔不管是黃是白，眼睛不問是黑是綠，睡眠的重要是大家公認的。</p>
<p>在事實上，我們如能上床卽陲，南柯一夢，晨鷄破曉，昨日之疲勞，卽可恢復：黑甜味永，心曠神怡，愉快舒適，非言可喩。反之，枕蓆輾轉，合睫維艱，思慮波起，塵念叢生，聽壁上鐘聲滴達，聞他人鼾呼雷動，亦恨亦羨，翌日神憊力疲，心煩意亂，苦悶抑鬱，不一而足。衛生家有言：『酣熟之睡眠，滋養之食物，淸鮮之空氣，適度之運動，同爲人類養生之要素。』這的是金石之言來幾句爛調子，噫，旨哉言乎，睡眠於吾人健康之關係綦重，顧可忽諸哉</p>
<p>失眠到也可分爲三種：　續發性失眠，這種睡不着是發生於他種病痛的時侯。比如持續的疼痛，劇烈的咳嗽，頻繁的下痢，……都可使人在夜間，不能高枕而臥，但這些病疼消失，睡眠卽可照常。　一時性失眠，大半因日常生活一時變調的關係。比如新婚之夕，玉人在側，這一夜就不容易睡着。逆旅安息，喧囂煩擾，也不容易睡。還有換了床舖，便不能睡的人。統而言之，各種臨時神經之刺戟，憂思及懸念，是可使人一時失去常態，不獲安枕；但生活規復原狀，或習慣後，可以恢復。　持續性失眠，可說是一時性失眠的運鎖及延長普通所謂失眠，是指此而言，其經過可數月數年，極使美者困苦。</p>
<p>現在社會裏失眠的人，根據臨證上的遭遇，着實不少，不是誇張的推測，可與現代失業的人數相映成趣。我們患失眠的祖宗泉下有知，看見這許多賢子良孫，頗能發潛德之幽光，克紹箕裘，想來笑得下巴頷都要掉下來了。</p>
<p>現代的人，何以這麼多患着失眠症？這却是文明進步的高功。患失眠的人，無不神經衰弱，是近代極普遍的疾病，文明的國家，繁華的都市，這類的病人，滿坑滿谷，物質是天天進步，事業需刻刻競爭，百憂戚心，萬事勞形，能使你神經衰弱不得安眠。歌台舞塲，長夜爲歡，風俗淫靡，縱情逸樂，精神過勞，感情激動，能使你神經衰弱，不得安眠。窮朋友，愁衣慮食，咄咄書空　，仰屋興嗟，不得安眠。總之在現代環境下，使人神經受刺戟的素因，多呢，舉不勝舉。</p>
<p>失眠的狀態，人各不一。有的臥時睡意毫無，雖精神疲乏，而入睡爲難。有徹夜目不交睫者。有通宵爲惡夢所擾者。有雖能入睡，二三小時後，一覺醒後不獲再睡者。有恍恍忽忽，鼾聲不作，而自已不覺其睡者。有一夜醒覺數次者。形形色色，各如其面，並不一致。</p>
<p>失眠的結果，感覺非常的勞頓，心绪惡劣，懶於作業，興會索然。繼則頭昏腦漲，消化障礙，東也是難過，西也是不適，其中苦况，非過來人自難洞悉</p>
<p>某一時期，敝人爲了某一事伴（不是追求失敗，也不是投機蝕本。），失眠有一個多月之久。在讀者想來我是醫生，自病自醫，還不便當嗎？果然那時並不糊塗，各種催眠藥，都曾試過，「不電」，「不靈」，是嘗試的成功。這大槪心病不去，藥力難施的原故吧。</p>
<p>最後，我摜火了，管他媽的，老子不怕死，怕睡不着嗎？「失眠，」「失眠，」不再去理會他了。一方面把我所顧念的某件事情，看得明白，又看得糊塗，向前想想，退後想想，人總是要死的，死了還不都是個拍空？我生之日，盡我的力量，做我的事情，不悲觀，不樂觀，消極中有積極，積極中有消極。說也奇怪，我存了這種信念，「失眠」竟在不知不覺中吿愈，正是「解鈴還是繫鉿人，心病祇需心藥醫」啊。</p>
<p>最後，我抄錄橋下客的話作本文的結束：「敬吿醫家，遇到失眠之人而輒授以安眠藥，直吃到各種安眠藥不靈爲止，這簡直是使科學破產的辦法。」我對自已，就曾犯過。「敬吿病家，遇到醫師不能確知失眠的原因時，最好不要注意失眠這伴事；偶不注意，失眠會無端而愈。」這又是我自身經騐，失眠同志，其注意及之！</p>
<h3>肺癆統計之世界觀（三）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康（三）</p>
<p>法國之結核死亡例，比較的亦甚高。而全國之死亡原因調查表，及醫師之報吿，亦不能十分確實。在一九二六年有二一，四％之死亡例，其原因爲不明者。在大城市中如馬賽等處，有五十％之死亡原因爲不明者。然則其中百分之幾爲結核死亡例乎，頗屬疑問。惟在事實上，則死亡例確已减少，且大城市中之死亡例，較之鄕間允爲减少，此由於個人衛生改進之影響，產接的由於防癆工作之保護方法及醫生之治療方法之改進。現時法國防癆「診療網」之組織，巳非常完善，然其成續，尙不能十分滿意。以普通而論，結核死亡例之高峯，在歐洲各國間，法國當爲最高之保持者。</p>
<p>關於結核保護及預防工作之成續果何如乎，以Amsler氏研究之結果，在五十個家庭，其家屬間曾有直接結核之傳染發生者，於一百八十四　子孫巾，有一百十人因結核而死亡，而其中之八十四例，在三歲以前即已死亡，而別一方面，在此五十個結核家庭中，有一百七十三幼孩，由保護所施以預防工作者，在二年至八年之時期內，僅有六例因結核而死亡，而共中之三例在二歲內卽已死亡。</p>
<p>法國之馬達加斯加地方，在一九二七年，結核之死亡例，占全數七分之一，士著與其他入種，初無甚大區別，防癆工作不敷遠甚。在摩洛哥阿而根及撒哈拉等地方，均有同一現象。所堪注意者，爲戰前之死亡例，初不甚高，但在離開及歸來之後，其死亡例漸漸增加。</p>
<p>比利時之結核死亡例，情形甚爲安全。Oldrechts氏之統計，在一九二五年，爲每一萬人中，有七，二例，婦女則爲六，八例。在一九二九年，則每一萬人中，不及七例矣。在一八八七年以前之統計，婦女之結核死亡例，非常增高，現時始行漸漸低减。在一九零三年起，則鄕村間之死亡例，較之城市爲安靜。</p>
<p>比利時康果之衛生情形，甚堪注意，其地對於結核症非常危險，在自己痊愈期中，往往增惡而變成急性。該地之結核症，多由阿拉伯人印度斯及黑人支流而來，現時已施行一種條例，凡開放性結核患者，不許入境，居民俱有報吿之義務，凡病者俱須受相當之診療。在　　　一九二八年之觀察，患病之總數，已行减少，但其居民結核傳染之總數，當在一〇％至六％之間云。</p>
<p>瑞士之結核死亡例，較之其死亡總數，並不十分减少。卽較之歐洲其他各國，如奧國匈牙利愛而蘭芬蘭諸國，其死亡例亦高。其死亡之年齡，大多爲幼童時代。結核死亡例之公開報吿，在大城市間，被結核侵襲者，多屬年富力强之靑年，而其死亡數亦屬至高。實際上結核死亡數，在瑞士城市與鄕村之間，並無甚大區別，因城市間之衛生改進，較之鄕村爲完善，經過防癆工作及療養所之設立，患者均得以延長其生命。所認爲嚴重之問題者，爲結核傳染之途徑，是吾增加，抑已减少，因瑞士國民無報吿之義務，住宅不能十分隔離，故欲達結核傳染减少之目的，似爲困難之舉耳。現時瑞士諸州，正在從事防癆進展之中。</p>
<p>南歐諸國，如羅馬尼亞及希臘二國之結核死亡例均高，防癆組織之不健全，及經濟來源之困難，二者均爲必須打破之要事，庶能達到防癆成功之目的。</p>
<p>匈牙利平原之衛生狀况，亦甚惡劣，共原因由於夏季酷熱，而冬季烈風多塵房屋之構造，甚爲困難，而結核症之在該國，可稱爲居住病，亦無不可。</p>
<p>在北歐之結核死亡例，較爲安全，如丹麥挪威瑞典等國均是Neander氏報吿，瑞典北部拿北登州之結核死亡例，較前已减少二八％，挪威之結核死亡例，亦已逐年减少，在一九二九年，每一萬居民中尙有十五，六之死亡例，以文明各國之比較例觀之，則列入第十一位，但其减少之死亡例，在兩性間及老幼間有同一减少之傾向。Dahl氏以爲在幼孩時代，經過牛類結核菌之腸中傳染引起無危險之免疫性，與結核死亡例之减一少，有極大影響。最有味者，挪威Heimbeck氏試騐其士白可林反應Tuberculi</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>n，發現城市間之居民，在三十歲有九九％被結核所侵襲，鄕村間之居民，則延遲至四十歲前後云。又eitrnann氏認爲入民生活的及經濟的情形改善，與結核死亡例减少之原因，初無極大關係，而最重要者，爲防止結核之散布及傳染，故保險組織之普及，衛生常識之宣傳，與公共衛生之保護工作等，爲防癆十分重要之舉。</p>
<p>在丹麥之結核死亡例，甚爲安全，以一九二八年之統計，在城市間爲每一萬人中有六·三例，全境爲七·五例之死亡數，故城市間與鄉村間之居民，其被結核侵襲之程度，初無區別，在二千例鄉民之試騐，僅有五九％陽性之土白可林反應，但在大城市居住若干年後，其結果大槪多變成陽性反應，故丹麥對於防癆工作，甚爲安全。每一百個結核死亡患者，平均有一百三十一個病床供其使用。</p>
<p>北部及南部格樂蘭Groenland之結核死亡例，非常之高，其原因由於不良之居屋，結核之傳染期極早，全境之居民有一三％至一七％患有肺結核症，故經濟情形及居住問題之改善，非常重要</p>
<p>歐洲東部諸國，如波蘭衣司蘭及立道諸境，其公布之結核死亡例亦甚高，而迄今尚無减低之趨勢。如立道在一九二五年之結核死亡例，爲每一萬人中有二八·七例。在衣司蘭，自一九二三至一九二八年止，平均每一萬人中有二三·五％。在波蘭西南境之死亡例，亦不相上下。三國之防癆工作，可稱毫無成績。</p>
<p>俄國全境之統計，甚不一致，醫師之死亡原因報吿，自一九二五年始有較確之報吿。搜羅此種統計材料者，爲方氏Feinshmidt，但其範圍僅屬於城市區域。在世界大戰期內之死亡例，與其他交戰各國相等，但因戰後革命戰爭及饑饉疾病之流行，故結核死亡例之高，直達至一九二二年爲止，在一二三年，結核之死亡例之高峯，始行低降，其平均例，在四大城市間，一九二二年爲三三·五例，（均爲每一萬人民中之統計例）一九二三年爲一九·〇二例，一九二七年爲一三·四五例，方氏以爲此種統計趣化之改善，乃由於公共衛生情形之進步，另一原因，由於大戰時染得結核症之患者，已逐年死亡凈盡之所致。</p>
<p>現時俄羅斯民族之結核死亡例，較之蘇維埃聯邦內其他民族如Kirgisen,Tartaren，Burjaden爲高，因其民族生活情形不甚舒適。又俄國南境如高加索地方，結核死亡例亦高，因患者多不往療養院診治，故其傳染非常危險。在西伯利亞之東部，則氣候較佳，少雲而富陽光，故患結核症者較少。</p>
<p>北美洲之結核統計，Sweany氏證明死亡例之高峯，與居住之密度，極有關係，故防癆工作之主點，須注意地點及容量，而設法將居民改善其公共衛生。Alen　Krause氏以爲北美合衆國結核之傳布，由於經濟發展的原因，結核患者之增加，與工業之發達，成爲正比例，直至一八九〇年爲止，由是以後，結核死亡例則逐年减少，其原因由於公共衛生條例之宣布，及有效之執行方法。Shenard氏以爲結核死亡例减少之原因，雖有多端，大別之爲公共衛生的設備一，及醫療的進展。據Gilderg氏之報吿一如下:</p>
<p>一九〇四年　二〇，一死亡例（每一萬居民中）</p>
<p>一九三一年　六，七死亡例（每一萬居民中）</p>
<p>在本世紀之初，美國以結核死亡例占全死亡數之第一位，但至今日已退至第六位矣。在近年經濟恐慌時代，結核死亡例之遞减程度，亦有停止之傾向，或竟稍稍增高，亦未可知。此種死亡例增高或减少之傾向，與有色人種，亦有相當之關係。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（八十三）何謂白內障（續）</p>
<p>白內障的種類白內障的種類。是由發病的原因與時期，混濁的位置與形狀，及核的有無而區別的。普通先天性白內障大都限局於中心及前後兩極。所以在醫學上特分爲前極白內障，後極白內障，中心白內障，紡綞狀白內障，及點狀白內障等等種類。牠的經過。多爲停止性。至於後天性白內障。則多爲進行性。牠的種類。已於上期所述本病原因項內詳細叙述。最多的一種。當爲老人性白內障。牠的經過情形。可依混濁的進行程序。分爲初發白內障，未熟白內障，成熟白內障，及過熟白內障的四期。四期的病情。各有不同。</p>
<p>白內障的症狀　白內障的主要自覺症狀。就是視力障碍。障碍的輕重。是依水晶體混濁的程度及位置而異。瞳孔領內若有點狀混濁晶的時候。患者常訴飛蚊症。混濁若在水晶體周圍的時侯。則訴夜盲症。這是因爲在夜間或在光錢不足的地方。瞳孔散大的緣故。以致引起視力障碍。混濁若在水晶體中央的時侯。則訴畫盲症。這是因爲在畫間光綫强烈。瞳孔縮小的緣故。以致引起視爲障碍。至於他覺的症狀。則於瞳孔頒內生有混濁時。卽可察見灰白色的混濁。此種混濁如用斜照法檢查。則呈灰白色或帶褐色。如用徹照法檢查。則呈黑色。混濁的形狀，廣狹，及濃淡。則因白內障的種類而有不同。</p>
<p>本病的治療。須行手術。方克奏效。若用藥物醫治。則難兒愈。</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（二十三蒼耳）Xanthium　Strumarium，L.</p>
<p>（植物）自生於原野，一年草也·莖高1——1.5尺，全株密生剛毛。葉對生，有柄，作三角狀心髒形，組齒牙緣，頭尖鋭，屢作　3—5裂。夏日開綠色之單性花，頂生雄花，雌花密生於其基部。果瘦小，作廣卵形，有鉤刺。</p>
<p>（生藥）蒼耳子Enuctus　Xanthu卽採集其果實而成者也。本品作廣卵形，尖端有二嘴，長僅的10—12公厘。表面呈灰黃色或灰色，全面密生鉤刺。味稍苦。</p>
<p>（成分）僅知果實中之一種成分，爲黃色無晶形配糖體Xanthastrumarin之物質，其性狀不詳。</p>
<p>（藥用）舊說：蒼耳子有解熱，發汗之效，又可治頭痛。一回用量爲8—10公分，作煎劑用。又謂莖葉揉軟，敷貼疥癬，憑疹及蟲傷有效。（未完）</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（二十六）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一二七問）　牙粉牙膏有什麽價值？</p>
<p>答　牙粉牙膏，可作爲刷牙時淸潔口腔的輔助品，在健康正常而又勤的刷牙的人，並不是一定要用的，不過好的牙粉牙膏，確有很多好處，能够增加刷牙的磨擦力，减少口腔內的微菌，中和口腔內的酸質。</p>
<p>（第一二八問）　牙粉牙膏應該怎樣選擇？　　答　粗糙的牙粉，有害牙磁，不可購買，最好的牙粉，多半以沉澱過的炭酸鈣（Precipitated　calcum　Cardonate）加些皂粉薄荷油等製成，極爲細嫩，不傷牙齒。市上的牙粉，若是覺得細嫩而又是著名廠家所出的，大槪可用。至於牙膏，其實和牙粉相同，不過加些甘油和膠質，使成糊狀罷了。</p>
<p>（第一二九問）　淸潔口腔，除刷牙外，還有什　　麼方法，可以常用？　　答　可用漱口藥水漱口，在口腔不潔，牙齒不健全，或是口腔易發炎症的人，更宜常用。</p>
<p>（第一三零問）　好的漱口藥水，應該備有幾種條件。　　答　　具有防腐消毒的性質，同時又不致過於刺激軟組織，使牠損傷。　不會破壤唾液的發酵功用。　沒有毒質，卽使嚥下，亦無妨礙。</p>
<p>（第一三一問）　漱口藥水能够使口腔完全消毒嗎？　　答　漱口藥水，雖有防腐消毒的作用，但决不能完全使口腔消毒無菌，不過可以防止微菌的繁殖，减少微菌的數量。若是因爲要增强消毒的作用，把劇烈殺菌的藥去配合，非特無益，而且有害。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八六）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八節　手術的治療</p>
<p>除開人工氣胸外，還有胸腔形成術，橫隔膜神經切斷術，石蠟塡充術，這都是附屬於手術治療範圍以內的。他們的施行，雖沒有人工氣胸那樣普遍，但有時候確可以補救人工氣胸手術之不及的。關於他們的大槪情形，現在且分述於下面：</p>
<p>胸腔形成術。　這是將胸廓脊椎二側之肋骨切除，他的目的，爲胸廓內腔縮小，肺部組織受壓；此種手術，比較其他爲複雜，故對於身體衰弱之病者，是不很適宜的。但對於胸膜二葉癒着，絕對不能施行人工氣胸的患者們，他是完全能够補救此種缺陷的，這楚最重要的適應症。此外，像行人工氣胸後，而病勢仍在進行者；因經濟狀况，不能擔負人工氣胸長期療治者；以及發生膿胸及人工氣胸之合併者；都很值得一試的。他的經過，據Sauerbruch氏之報吿，大致有百分之四十能够轉危爲安的。關於他的禁忌症，則大致與人工氣胸手術同。</p>
<p>橫隔膜神經切斷術。　橫隔膜神經爲司呼吸運動神經之一，如果切此神經，則橫隔膜運動麻痺；結果遂向上而壓迫肺部，和入工氣胸的目的，是異曲而同工的。他對偏於下葉之病灶，是特殊有良好之效果的；如果兩側的本病，而不能施行人工氣胸及胸腔形成術時，他也可以補敎此種缺陷的。此外，在人工氣胸及胸腔形成術前，先施行此種手術，則肺部被壓迫動作更形增强，於促進病灶之結痂上，也是不無助力的。</p>
<p>石蠟塡充術。　這一種手術，完全係對付空洞的。他是用切開手術，按病灶空洞部位之大小，塡充以石蠟，使空洞壓縮，俾達治療之目的的。他的適應症是：病灶限於肺尖，潰爛成空洞狀態；而胸膜二葉癒着，不能施行人工氣胸手術，兩側性本病，又不能施行胸腔形成術，爲最合格。據有些專家的報吿，經過的成續是時見良好的；祇是此種純粹的例症不很多見罷了！（本章完）</p>

<h3>政治戲法</h3>
<p>— 李汶</p>
<p>因為人是不斷努力上進的，所以總時時力圖增進其生活。在生活很順利的向前增進時，人不再發生什麽重大的煩悶，而是一心一意的工作着。但當其生活發生障礙時，他就需要改善這生活。當此之時，凡是足以引起其改善生活之希望的舉動，不論是事實的行為，或是空洞的激刺，人都熱烈的會歡迎與擁護。所以政治上的人物，他若要使其统治地位稳固，不外两个方法：一是以事实的行爲，具體改善社會羣衆之生活，來換取人們的一心一意，努力向上；一是僅以一时的空洞的激刺，来骗改人们的一时的麻醉或疯狂。前者可以以一個事實，長久發展下去；後者則必須時時改變其方式，來騙取人們短時期的刺激所謂政治策略，其內容實在不過是這兩個原則的運用而已。</p>
<p>所謂「不能給人民以麵包，就得給人民以光榮。」就是這個意思。給人民以麵包，可謂是事實的行爲：而僅給人民以光榮，則可謂是一種空洞的激刺。每一個空洞的激刺，事實上難以維持長久，少則幾月，多則一年，到其效果不驗時，西洋鏡已經折穿，人再也不來相信，此時，必須再掉一個花樣，給人們以新的刺激，雖然骨子裏還不過是那一套老花樣，但外面總算又穿上了一伴新衣，又可騙得若干時的人們的幻想。這樣子層出不窮，人們不斷受騙，可是他政治的策略的目的，是已達到了。事實上，目前這種事例眞是觸目皆是。　　德國的政治家於退出國聯，排擊猶太人，重整軍備等等一大串的刺激行爲後，此刻又有出兵萊茵河區域之舉，接着便是舉行選舉，在選舉之前，並舉行大規模示威運動兩天，元首希特勒在克虜伯軍火廠向全國人民廣播演說，演說前全國交通除火車飛機外，一律停止一分鐘，人民均須羣集街頭，恭聆元首演說。全國人民均須表示德國重獲自由平等之興奮情緒。電訊所傳，甚爲簡單，但一種熱鬧情形，已躍然紙上，我們若能親到德國，此刻一定可以看見希氏的許多徒子徒孫，在那裹努力佈置這個「興奮情緒」。直正的人民等於一羣小孩子，哭聲是被他們所敲打着的喧天鑼鼓之聲所淹沒了。眞的，我們此刻好像在看戲呢。</p>
<h3>沒落的人</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>「想不到這家人如今落得這田地。」年紀高邁的入們，大槪還能依稀記得的：</p>
<p>「二少奶，你眞有福啦，」</p>
<p>男人恰是行二，低身份或地下人便都尊敬地这樣稱呼女人了。同樣是一句極平常的稱呼，若把日子倒轉去二十年，那時刻，入差不多全用了非常恭謹的口吻喊着，並用了最大的艷羨的神色加以咀嚼着的，可是如今，人們雖仍是習慣地呌，却是懶懶地，好像不願意以這兩個字加在一個不值得稱呼的人身上，甚且還含有相當輕蔑的氣味。那時刻，二少奶的娘家和男人家，兩邊的對手親家都是朝廷」上頂顯赫的官員，而二少奶是頂能得人寵愛的，因之她愈顯出高貴了。那時刻，二少奶，她終年躲藏深沉的大屋子，珍重有如古董似的，除了鎭上好日子在婢僕簇擁中出來看熱鬧，從來不會自己跨出門限一步，輕易是不能看見她的。……</p>
<p>自從兩親家先後死去，接着二少奶的男人不久亦死去了，但人雖死，留下來一份財產是不薄，足够儘凈吃一輩子的，她二少奶一共有四個兒子，家裏有的是錢，於是都落得閒蕩過日，只管揮霍，不做事，而二少奶自己是一個性情懦弱，吃慣用慣享樂慣的人，對見子們的討債似的亂花錢，她是不大管顧或覺得惋惜，卽是她自己，亦很有一手浪費的本領：每日裹閒着沒事，也不逢着年關節候，老是無端大籃小籃的買了一些貴價的東西燒燉吃掉。在那樣惟有流出，沒有流進的情形下，不消幾年，一份財產就精光了。……</p>
<p>到了此時，兒子們明白家裏已榨不出油來，不得不四散出外各自尋生計之路去。</p>
<p>偌大的統共有六進獨立房子連起來的大厦，只孤單地住着大媳婦和大保和二少奶她自己。然而二少奶好像十分安心於一天不如一天的境况，對過去亦完全無後悔與傷悲一樣。她的嗜吃仍舊不變，最後她向着逼大壓轉念頭了·起先是把空房子佃給人家，接着一間間佃出去，終局祇勝下自己住的一間房子了。等候佃期滿，沒力贖回，就述根亦賣斷，不過很短促的日子，這大厦便不是她所有，而從主的地位一變而爲客人了。還得反納租給別人，再過幾時，只好搬到木板屋子的地方去了。</p>
<p>—不是貨的倒媚娼婦，丢盡祖上的臉，宗族的臉。連屋子倒硬生生吃進肚子去了。</p>
<p>在鄉里間引起的人們的譏議或署駡。二少她根本不加計較，儘自做她的。她很有一股見蠻勁，自己做自已領受，毫無半句怨語。</p>
<p>現在呢，二少奶在木板屋子已經有很久的時間了。三口子每天是過着三銅子兒油，五銅子兒炭，兩升米零零落落地買着的這樣的日子。</p>
<p>「活該，這種人沒好死的，自作孽」。人看到這樣子，是光有咒詛，沒有同情，而二少奶亦彷彿不需要人的同情。她是異樣孤獨了。但在有人喜歡合她撩天的時侯，她會悠然地說道：</p>
<p>「一個人什麼玩樂全嘗過吃點點兒苦到不錯。」</p>
<h3>陰暗的角落裏</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>當我第二次到澳門去的時候，正是從家裹逃走了出來。身上沒有許多的錢，就住在一間陰暗的小旅店裹，爲了是等候我的表妹寄來的消息，而且開始找尋工作去了。</p>
<p>可是，我什麽都不懂得，事實上還是一個小孩子呵！所以，我很苦惱地？開始去在那囂雜的街頭徬徨起來了。從早上，被街外的熱鬧的聲音播進我那陰暗的小房子裹的時候，我悄悄地離開了這流浪入的家，在街上跑着，一直到了深夜，街頭巳掛上了蛀霓似的燈光，那一雙一雙的南國姑娘們，穿得那麽迷人，花枝似的招展着，佔滿了澳門的大街小巷了：我正好像一個被綁票過的人，拖着疲乏的腿見，在那響亮的絃歌播揚中，又回到陰暗的角落裏。——這樣的慘淡的生活了的十多天了。漸漸兒的煩悶起來，就好像被浸在那沉悶的酒精裹似的，我差不多要怨恨起澳門，要怨恨那罪惡的地方了。</p>
<p>工作還沒有找到，原因是，我沒有一個親友，這地方完全是陌生的，那遙長的街道，沒有可以給我停留的地方，沒有一個人和我談着心裹的話。那年輕的表妹呢？他還躲在鄉村裏，她會說過，她可以介紹我到一家藥房裹做事，郝藥房是她的舊同學劉小姐的父親開的。她也許還在澳門吧。可是，我等了許多日子，她還沒有回信，過去，我不但感到那完全不熟識的藥房生活是討厭的，現在連做小伙計的希望也沒有了。於是，我不禁地嘆了起來：「還是離開這兒吧！」可是，到那兒去呢？到處是一樣陰黑的世界呵！</p>
<p>在徬徨的生活中，我漸漸地感到生活恐慌起來了。我就連門也不出一步整天地躲在那陰暗的房子裹，有時看看小說，有時就皺着眉頭的靠着床，胡思亂想。在這個時間中，那個老夥計就常常跑進來跟我閒談了。他的年紀大的是四五十歲吧，生得很矮小，臉兒長長的，已掛上一點兒皺紋，頭髮薄而且少得很，有着一副機警的眼睛。就好像一隻猫似的在探察着。他似乎沒有什麼工作，也許因爲旅客很少的緣故吧，所以，他不厭煩地來跟我談話了。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽這樣沉悶呢？跟我出去跑一跑吧！」</p>
<p>他張着有經騐的笑臉和嘴巴。扭着我的手。</p>
<p>「有什麽用呢？那兒都一樣的，沒有一個目的！」</p>
<p>「那麽，賭番攤去吧。贏了錢，我們快樂一下去呀！」</p>
<p>賭錢，我是不高與的，我拒絕了，</p>
<p>「那麽，跟我逛逛花寨去吧，像你這樣年輕的人，是的，我介紹你一個，多麽好的女見，又漂亮又乾凈，又有好心腸，那女見包你滿意的。也許，你給他一雨夜的銀，她高興的話，就長久不要你的錢了。……」</p>
<p>他就像媒婆似的說三說四，用淫猥似的手勢誘惑我。</p>
<p>「如果你不願意，我介紹一個自身的給你吧，那更乾凈，錢更不成問題的，像你這樣的年輕人，那個女人都中意的。」</p>
<p>我的心更煩惱起來了，我瞪着他的臉孔，但腦袋裏都想着我的出路，工作，表妹的信！不但沒有心情跟他去玩，而且，他的樣子，越看越可怕了。他就好像要我跟他走那條路似的，執拗地</p>
<p>「那用不到怕，在澳門，二十年了，我那兒都懂得，如果你害怕生毛病，吃一點藥，那藥方，將來我就吿訴你吧！眞的，用不到害怕呵！我年靑的時候，那病把頭髮都落光了。可是，總能够醫的，我的方法很多！」</p>
<p>我不曾跟他出去，我又要寫一封信，寄給我的表妹。他問我的表妹是什麽地方的人。我吿訴他，他就跳起來的拍着我的臂膀：</p>
<p>「好呀！我有一個朋友是做水客，我也是斗門的人，我介紹你的信給他帶去吧，兩天，很快的就有覆信了！你要不要她寄錢來給你呢？」</p>
<p>我快樂極了，因爲有人帶信給表妹，所以，才跟他出去了。</p>
<p>那老傢伙耍我付一塊錢酬金，而且說了一大堆話：</p>
<p>「如果她寄錢來給你，我準要帶你玩玩好的地方，你想在澳門長久生活下去嗎？我可以介紹你入我們一夥的，大家帮忙，我們一帮人在澳門是有勢力的。」</p>
<p>他笑着，在鼓勵我，我想：「這陰暗的落角裏，我也走那條路嗎？」</p>
<p>我失望地離開了那陰暗的角落裹。</p>
<h3>蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 黑雀</p>
<p>這該是個笑話：期待了六天後的一個禮拜日，當我的朋友如的到我寓所來的時候，在南窗下相對靜坐着半嚮，却想不出消遺這期待着的日子的去處。據說人類是可以分爲多少種類的，但是我們不知道自己該歸入那一種門類？六天的工作，消蝕着自己有限的血肉之軀的時候，時常像孩子似的搶着指頭計算一個期待的日子，但是每一個禮拜天的到來，我們又像被驅逐出了這個世界，這個期待的日子相反地給了我們更大的苦痛。</p>
<p>春天的口子是短的，靜坐着，靜坐着，太陽漸漸地移向東墻了。我是頗喜歡這個靜恬的院子的。屋主人是個養蜂專家，蜂房就做在我的南窗下。太陽是</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>鋪滿着這個小小的院子，成羣的蜜蜂在墻上飛來飛去。春天百花開放，是他們釀蜜的時候。記得這小動物在敎科書上被採爲寓言勉勵做人應該像他們一樣勤奮以防不測的時候。但是他們每天無休息的釀蜜，把蜂房中的臘格都鋪上了香酣的蜜糖的時候，他的主人祇要一與手之勞獲得了他們辛勤了幾個月的代價。這小動物雖然毫無所知的享受着遺留下來的一份食糧，還是在花開花落的時候做他們的工作，但是這樓上正住着一個和他們同命運的人類呢。我常這樣靜坐在南窗下，面向着院子，我眼前却是另外的一個世界　沒有蜂房，沒有蜜蜂，甚至沒有這院子，我是在許多種的人類中搜尋自己該歸入的一種，但是這一種始終沒有被我發兒。眼前恢復了那些在墻上飛來飛去的蜜蜂時，我好像憬悟我或許也是蜜蜂的同類呢！於是我同情這小動物，由這小動物我喜歡這院子我們該用集合的力量把被剝奪的東西收爲己有！</p>
<p>太陽很快的拋出了墻角，這世界巳在夜神的翅翼之下了。我們彷彿做完了一天的工作似的拖着疲乏的身體做我們的晚餐，而吃飯也好像盡義務似的送走了這個期待的禮拜。</p>
<p>朋友走後，屋子裏顯得更寂寞了，蜜蜂嗡嗡的聲音幾乎特別擴大了在我耳畔嚮着，他們想向我訴說此什麽，或是懂得我的意思呢？我向窗外望去，是一片漆黑，什麽都沒有。</p>
<h3>瞎話</h3>
<p>— （吹）</p>
<p>希特勒對羅卡諾公的協定的意見，謂在德國邊界關一非武裝區域，實不合相互平等原則，外兵駐於德士之後，德國民意實不解其用意何在，當知我人提出之平等要求，决不退讓絲毫云云，譚老三曰，這種藥只能給一般弱小民族吃，方配味口，若給希特勒吃，恐怕休想。</p>
<p>美國太平洋艦隊，動員舉行大操，目的地嚴守秘密，譚老三曰，這是美國的最好姿勢，可是他們的姿勢，祇有這樣，此美國之所以爲美國也歟。播音</p>

<p>荒村古刹</p>
<p>十多年前，軍閥混戰的年頭。嫂嫂和姑娘帶了雪兒，從家裏逃出來，因為嫂嫂的腳小伶仃，瞳了幾裏路，實在不能再走了！所以看見一座古廟，就跑到裏面去休息。眞的事情太不巧了，刚才坐了没有一忽兒，忽然聽到廟外有大兵的聲昔，這時她們三人急昏了，還算由姑娘提醒，才躲藏在神座背後，希望大兵走後再逃。</p>
<p>但是三個大兵巳聽到廟裹三個女子的講話聲，他們那裹肯放過這機會呢？</p>
<p>真的，太不幸，忽然雪兒要小便叫了出來，當然被大兵們聽到，就從神座背後把雪兒拖了出來，嫂嫂看見自己的親生子被大兵捉去，自然母子有關天性，馬上自已從神座背後跑出來保護雪兒，三個大兵看到跑出一個女子來，眞的把他們快活得跳了起來，甲乙內三人大家爭奪道一個嫂嫂？這時雪兒帮着母親把丙咬了一口，被丙一把　起來了甩死在地上。</p>
<p>不過三個人分一個女子，怎麽能分得平均呢？後來還是甲提誠再搜查一下看，因爲剛才明明聽到三個人的聲音，現在還只有二個呢，這樣一來，姑娘被甲從神背後，亦搜了出來，甲乙丙一看是一個黃花閨女，更了不得，誰也不肯讓誰，大家都要先玩，甲與乙爲了爭先玩，而甲把乙一刀刺死了！</p>
<p>但是螳螂捕蟬，黃雀在後，丙把甲暗放一槍，打了個斷氣，那時候再也沒有人跟丙爭這個黃花閨女！不過姑娘不從他有什麽辦法　？二個人的談話中，姑娘忽然發現道個丙，就是她的親哥哥，嫂嫂的丈夫，雪兒的爸爸，可是雪兒已經被他親手甩死了，當時嫂嫂聽到這個甩死她兒子的就是自己的丈夫，她覺悟了今後再也不能跟這個禽　殘酷的丈夫合作，雖然丙是向她　悔，有什麽用呢？她是頭也不回的向外跑出去了！</p>

<h3>聯合影訉</h3>
<p>國泰現在開映的「名士殉情記」The　pe　rirfied　Fores是一部以表演旯長的言情片。撗寫一對陌路相逢的青年男女，在極度危亡的環境下，燃着戀愛之火。主角李思廉霍華和蓓帝黛維絲，都是以表演著稱的大明星，所以演來倍加熱烈緊張。</p>
<p>銀幕上的大偉人保羅茂尼，曾在「傷面人」裏演過强徒，「亡命者」裏演道逃亡者，「虎口餘生裏演過醫生，「怒潮」裏演過礦工，「神探尼萊」裏演過訪員，現在，他又將在「萬古流芳」The　Story　of　Lou　Pasteur片裏，和滬人相見了，他道一次是演那科學界的大偉人路易巴士德，日前在大光明試片時，大家都說這是保羅茂尼一部表演最佳的作品。該片已定月星期三晚場起，在大光明獻映云。</p>

<h3>「狂歡之夜」</h3>
<p>史東山道「長恨歌」後的新劇本</p>
<p>新華公司的第三部作品，由史東出導演一長恨歌」，非但與論一致贊美，營業也突破紀錄，一個影片耍取得與論營業的雙重勝利，决不是偶然倖致。現在所可以吿慰於讀者的。史東山父將繼「桃源春夢」之後導演新華公司的第五部作品，片名定「在歡之夜」，晃一個喜劇，但是他的作用不僅僅是使大家笑；也許觀衆都忍不住呵呵笑了，那時候却正是劇中人感到欲哭無淚。所以這個電影是另一種滋味，奧妙無窮；經過史更山的高明遵演的手法，「狂歡之夜」的成功，還成什麽問題？</p>
<p>劇本已在中央通過，開拍迫近目前，等幾天讓我們再來報吿關於「在歡之夜」的演員陣綫吧。</p>

<h3>The Culprit in the Wang Assassination Case Was Publicly Tried Yesterday; Only Three Were Interrogated, and the Trial Is Scheduled to Continue Today; Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang Both Denied</h3>
<p>Nanjing - Regarding the assassination of the former president of the Executive Yuan, the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court publicly tried the case at the Capital District Court at 1:00 PM on the 30th. Because of the gravity of the case, approximately 500 to 600 people from various quarters went to observe the proceedings, filling the criminal court to capacity, setting an unprecedented record. Central Committee members Chen Shuren, Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding, Wang Maogong, and others were also present. At precisely 1:00, Presiding Judge Lu Wenlan, Judges Long Canya and Wu Yuheng, Prosecutor Luo Renji, and Court Clerk Liu Jize arrived in court. The pistol used in the assassination was also displayed as evidence. All eight lawyers were present, and the court was declared in session. The defendants Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qing, six in total, were individually questioned regarding their age, place of origin, and occupation. The prosecutor then read the indictment, which was identical to the original bill of indictment. The presiding judge then instructed the defendants to refrain from denial regarding their previous statements and to provide honest testimony. The defendants were then individually interrogated, starting with Zhang Yuhua, from 2:18 PM to 4:15 PM. The interrogation was extremely detailed. Zhang initially denied any actual responsibility within the Chenguang Society and claimed that his previous confession was not factual. He then stated that the Chenguang Society's funds were obtained by Hua Ke from Wang Yaqiao, who in turn received them from Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, totaling 40,000 yuan, of which 30,000 yuan was used by Wang. The Nongguang Society received less than 10,000 yuan, but Chen and Li's provision of funds was based on personal relationships. He retracted his earlier statement that Chen and Li provided funds to plot the assassination of key central figures, disrupt public order, and scheme for political power. However, he admitted to three decisions to assassinate, with the initial target being Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The third decision was that if Chiang could not be assassinated, they would target [Wang Jingwei]; if both were impossible, they would create a disturbance. He denied any knowledge of Yu Likui's assassination of Song Ziwen, but stated that Yu was not involved in this case. He then confessed to joining the Communist Party ten years prior and leaving in 1934. He stated that the gathering three days before the assassination, on the evening of October 28th, was not a formal meeting but a casual conversation. During the conversation, Sun Fengming expressed his intention to assassinate, and he also expressed his approval. He originally advocated for using bombs instead of a pistol. After the second decision, they planned to find Guo Weizhong (phonetic) to carry out the task. He had taken Guo and Sun to Hong Kong, and Sun expressed his determination to proceed, so they did not replace him. After the incident, 860 yuan was brought from Hong Kong by Sun's wife, Cui Jingyao (phonetic). He then described his relationships with He, Liu, Li, Xiang, and Lu. He Poguang was then interrogated, and he was even more evasive, generally answering "I don't know" to important questions. He was repeatedly reprimanded by the presiding judge. He initially stated that he only learned of the entire plan after Zhang told him and that he had no intention of disrupting public order. He knew about the three decisions to assassinate, but he was not proactive. He admitted to obtaining the entry pass to the Central Party Headquarters on October 31st. He went twice, and the pass was issued on the second attempt. After giving it to Sun, he took a train to Hepingmen. He initially planned to go to Shanghai, but he got off in Zhenjiang for fear of inspection. Later, due to rumors, he was escorted by his sister-in-law to the countryside. When the presiding judge questioned him as to why he feared inspection if he was not involved, he could not justify himself and only claimed to know about the matter but not to have participated. At 5:25 PM, Liu Shurong was interrogated. His testimony was more straightforward than Zhang and He's. He admitted to knowing about the conspiracy beforehand, but claimed that everything was told to him by Zhang. The interrogation was completed at 5:55 PM. The presiding judge, citing the lateness of the hour, adjourned the court. The defendants were returned to custody, and the trial was scheduled to continue with the interrogation of Li, Xiang, and Lu at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 31st.

<p>Nanjing - The National Government held its weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Yu Youren, Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, and other officials from the National Government's various yuan, ministries, and commissions, totaling over 500 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the attendees in performing the rituals and then gave a speech on "Crime and Livelihood Issues." The speech concluded at 10:30 AM, and the meeting was adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - Chairman Lin reported on "Crime and Livelihood Issues" at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the morning of the 30th. He stated, "I recently reviewed the statistical report on current prison inmates submitted by the Judicial Yuan. The list only includes a portion of the inmates in national prisons. Remote provinces and regions are not yet included. The total number of male and female inmates is 60,745. When reports from all locations are complete, the total number of inmates nationwide will likely be around 100,000. The listed crimes can be divided into four categories. The first category is robbery and theft, with 31,309 inmates. The second category is assault and homicide, with 9,369 inmates. The third category is crimes against morality and marriage, with 3,572 inmates. The fourth category is opium and morphine-related crimes, with 7,594 inmates. In addition, there are 2,110 inmates convicted of endangering the Republic and internal rebellion. The remainder are various other crimes. Inmates convicted of endangering the Republic and internal rebellion account for only one-thirtieth of the total, indicating that few criminals aim to harm national public security. On the other hand, robbery and theft, crimes of an economic nature, account for over one-half of the total. If we consider the reasons for the second category, assault and homicide, it is likely that the majority are also due to livelihood issues. The motives for other crimes also inevitably involve some connection to livelihood. If we synthesize the reasons for crime, it is estimated that over two-thirds of the inmates nationwide committed crimes due to direct or indirect connections to livelihood. This requires careful examination. Compared to similar statistics from 1931, we have even greater and more serious concerns about the people's livelihood issues and living dangers. In 1931, there were over 2,500 cases of robbery and piracy. Recently, the same type of crime is over 14,500, almost a six-fold increase. In 1931, there were over 600 people punished under the Bandit Suppression Regulations. Recently, there are over 5,000, an increase of about eight times, which is a serious fact. There has also been a large increase in crimes against morality and marriage compared to the statistics of 1931. These all indicate the economic crisis facing our nation, the declining morals of the people, and are major issues for current governance. All administrative organs of the government should pay close attention," etc. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3>Public Trial of the Wang Jingwei Assassination Case</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's former president was suddenly attacked by an assassin during the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee on November 1st of last year, sustaining three gunshot wounds. Fortunately, due to effective medical treatment, he has gradually recovered. The occurrence of such a violent tragedy shocked the world. The assailant, Sun Fengming, died on the spot in the hospital. Therefore, the background of the incident and the truth remain unclear, and public speculation only causes confusion. Since the incident, the police and constabulary have been dispatched to search for accomplices. The media has maintained a calm stance to avoid divulging secrets. Although there have been reports of multiple arrests, newspapers have not published them, as this matter is of great importance and cannot be casually publicized. Now, after careful interrogation and repeated investigation, the case has been brought to trial by Luo Renji, a prosecutor of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The Fifth Branch of the High Court has appointed Lu Wenlan, the presiding judge of the criminal court, and judges Long Canya and Wu Yuheng to form a collegiate panel to conduct a public trial at the Capital District Court yesterday. The Wang Jingwei assassination case, which occurred five months ago and was gradually fading from people's minds, will once again become the focus of public attention.</p>
<p>According to the facts of the crime listed in Prosecutor Luo's indictment, this case involves Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, who, after the failure of the Fujian Incident, were unwilling to submit and wanted to harm key figures in the central government to disrupt the peace and order of the central and local governments. They then colluded with Wang Yaqiao, who specialized in forming gangs to carry out assassinations, and agreed on a plan. Chen and Li were responsible for providing financial support, while Wang Yaqiao was in charge of implementation. Wang entrusted the task of carrying out the assassination to the deceased Sun Fengming and the task of organizing and concealing the operation to Hua Kezhi (i.e., Hu Yunqing). As for the arrested Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Shenlin, and Lu Qingqi, they either organized the operation or merely participated in the planning, undertaking a portion of the work. At the same time, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, Zhang and He also confessed that they were ordered by Chen and Li, and the planners and implementers were Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi. They had established an assassination headquarters in Hong Kong and had planned to assassinate former Finance Minister Song Ziwen. Important cadres of Wang Yaqiao, such as Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and Zhang Zhihan, were hiding in the Hong Kong headquarters. Based on this information, the government immediately notified the Hong Kong government and sent personnel to arrest Yu Likui, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, and Zhang Zhihan, who can be extradited. It is expected that the trial of this case will only proceed after Yu Likui and others are extradited to Nanjing, as the key figure in the case is Wang Yaqiao, and Yu Likui and Wang Yaqiao were both implementers of the plan. Their positions are of equal importance and cannot be compared to Zhang and He, who only participated in the "confidential matters." Furthermore, it is said that many documents were seized in Hong Kong, and the confessions of Zhang and He can be corroborated by these documents.</p>
<p>In short, the inside story of this case is complex and involves a wide range of people. It is feared that the trial cannot be completed in a short period of time. The general public will pay more attention to this serious case. It is sincerely hoped that the judges presiding over the trial will use a calm mind and conduct thorough investigations to ensure that justice is done. Perhaps this foolish opinion will be welcomed by the wise.</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Attack Abyssinia, Continue Advancing Northward; Bombing Continues Relentlessly; Harar Reduced to Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>Asmara, Italian troops on the northern front continued their advance today, capturing four fortresses: Dagua, 50 miles south of Gondar; Adilimaqi, on the Bokden Plateau; Shagtai, 44 miles north of Lake Ashangi; and Dibale District, a center for livestock and food, known as the Chicago of Abyssinia. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Asmara, Italian troops are currently advancing on the northern front, having occupied Taikai without resistance, which is eight miles south of Dibale. Italian aircraft are very active along the entire front line. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, The government has issued a communiqué stating that several Italian aircraft on the northern front recently bombed the Ibellito area near Endameni, causing casualties. After the Abyssinian army retaliated with anti-aircraft guns, an Italian fighter plane was hit and crashed into Italian-held territory. The situation on the front lines is generally satisfactory. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, The Abyssinian Foreign Minister, Hailu Yi, has protested to the League of Nations, saying that the bombing of the city of Harar by 25 Italian aircraft on the southern front this morning "clearly violates Article 25 of the 1907 Hague Convention." (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, Harar, the most important town in Abyssinia after the secondary capital, has been reduced to a field of rubble after dozens of incendiary bombs were dropped by Italian aircraft today. Jijiga, east of Harar, was also heavily bombed by Italian aircraft today. According to the Harar Gazette, 60 Italian aircraft appeared in the sky over Harar this morning without dropping any bombs, and then flew away. Shortly thereafter, 37 aircraft returned and dropped bombs for an hour. The European quarter was not spared. Although the damage was not widespread, the losses were not small. The destroyed buildings included two churches, a French Catholic hospital, the Qibiti Catholic Church, a Muslim mosque, the French consulate, the former Italian consulate, a wireless station, the Egyptian Red Crescent hospital (15 bombs), the Abyssinian Red Cross hospital (several bombs), and two bombs near the Swedish hospital. According to eyewitnesses, the authorities issued a warning half an hour before the air raid, so most residents abandoned their homes and fled to the nearby mountains. It is feared that many of those who remained were killed or injured. Harar is the center of Islam in Abyssinia, and Italian troops have not previously disturbed Muslims, hoping to gain their support. The bombing of the city is viewed with great surprise in Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian government has lodged a strongly worded protest with the League of Nations, as Harar had been specially declared completely demilitarized. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, Twenty-five Italian aircraft flew to Harar on the southern front at 8:45 this morning and bombed it for half an hour. Dozens of bombs were dropped in the city center. According to information received here, residents had evacuated the city at dawn, so there were no casualties other than material losses. (29th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, It was rumored yesterday that a large Italian bomber was shot down by Abyssinian anti-aircraft guns during the bombing of Harar, and the pilot and crew were killed on the spot. However, official sources here have not yet received a formal report on this matter, so it remains to be confirmed. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, It is said that the French Red Cross relief team stationed in Harar was also bombed during the Italian air raid yesterday. Details regarding casualties and damage are still being investigated. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, According to recent investigations, at least 200 residents were killed in the Italian air raid on Harar. The city is still burning, and all efforts to extinguish the fire have so far been unsuccessful. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Gorahei, An Italian flying officer who participated in the heavy bombing of Harar yesterday told a Reuters reporter today that all aircraft strictly followed instructions and only attacked areas where troops were stationed and military depots were located. The aircraft carried photographs of the terrain, which were clearly marked, so there were no mistakes. Official sources say that 15 tons of bombs were dropped in the operation. Italian troops confirmed that most of the civilians in the city had evacuated, including the personnel of the French Catholic Church. The Abyssinian army was using the French church to store military supplies, hence the attack. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, Someone inquired with the Italian authorities about the Italian air raid on Harar. The reply was that no confirmed information had been received. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, Reuters Rome telegram: An Italian military aircraft with an engine crashed in central Italy, killing four soldiers. However, the wireless operator was unharmed. Also, at Versailles, France, two French civilian aircraft collided violently in the sky above the airfield, killing two people, a driver and a female doctor who was a passenger.

<h3>German Elections Conclude; Hitler Wins a Great Victory; Voter Turnout Reaches 90%; Counterproposal to Locarno Treaty to be Proposed Immediately</h3>
<p>Berlin, At 9:30 this morning, official results of the election were announced: of the 45,428,641 voters nationwide, 44,411,911 voted in favor of Head of State Hitler, accounting for 99% of the total number of voters; only 543,026 voted against. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, The results of the German parliamentary general election held yesterday have been announced by the authorities. The total number of eligible voters was 45,408,000; the number of voters who voted was 44,932,000; the number who expressed support for the Führer's policies was 44,389,000; and the number who expressed opposition to the Führer's policies was 543,000. The percentage ratio is 98.79% to 1.21%. These figures clearly demonstrate the absolute trust of all Germans in Hitler's policies and his peace plan. It is expected that the German government will soon put forward a new, concrete counterproposal in response to the Locarno Treaty proposals. (30th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, The victory won by the government is even greater than the results of the previous two plebiscites. The first plebiscite was held on November 13, 1933 (after Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference), and the affirmative vote accounted for 95% of the total votes cast. The second plebiscite was held on August 19, 1934 (after the death of President Hindenburg, Hitler succeeded as Head of State and Chancellor), and the affirmative vote accounted for 89% of the total votes cast.

<h3>Enthusiastic Election Situation; 70-Year-Old Man Votes Despite Illness; National Order to Display Flags in Celebration</h3>
<p>Berlin, Today is the date of the German parliamentary general election, and the enthusiasm of the situation was long expected by the general public. Almost all parts of the country have been swept into a frenzy. German expatriates from various overseas locations have also made special trips to return for this purpose. Here is a summary of the election situation in various places:</p>
<p>Berlin, Foreign travelers and residents currently spending the week here unanimously praise the enthusiasm of the people of Berlin participating in the general election today. Early in the morning, many Germans were seen with a bronze badge pinned to their chests, indicating that they had completed their voting duties. Führer Hitler returned here by car from the Rhineland city of Cologne. After getting out of the car, he filled out his ballot at the station and put it in the ballot box. The most touching scene was that of a man in his seventies who had been bedridden for months and was in critical condition. This morning, he suddenly defied the doctor's orders and insisted on walking to the ballot box to vote himself. As soon as he filled out his ballot and put it in, he collapsed and died. Also, a middle-aged woman filled out her ballot immediately after giving birth to twins and asked someone to put it in the ballot box for her. Situations like this were countless. Another event, which had never been seen in previous elections, was that many people took specially prepared balloons and ascended into the sky to put their ballots in the ballot box set up on the "Hindenburg" airship. In the evening, voters gathered in front of the Führer's office on Wilhelm Street, shouting loudly and continuously. Whenever Hitler appeared on the platform to express his gratitude to the voters, the clamor was deafening.</p>
<p>Bavaria, Four special trains arrived here from across the Austrian border today, carrying 3,600 German voters who had made special trips from various parts of Austria. Everyone was in high spirits. Similarly, the number of people who came from Paraguay and other places was the same.</p>
<p>Free City of Danzig, German residents here rushed to the German special ships anchored not far from here in the morning to prepare to vote. In a short time, the number of votes cast exceeded 10,000. The latter three are still continuing to vote.</p>
<p>Saar, The Saar region was recently recovered by Germany, so it is the first time in 17 years that it has regained the right to vote in the German parliamentary general election. Its level of enthusiasm is naturally more intense than elsewhere. Before noon, all residents of the region had completed their voting, just like the grand occasion of the plebiscite on the Saar's return to Germany.</p>
<p>Subitz Mountain, This mountain is the highest peak in Germany, towering more than 3,000 meters above the sky. It can be said to be the highest degree of the election campaign. Patients and travelers in various sanatoriums and hostels on the mountain also completed their voting locally. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin, The general election for the Reichstag ended at 6:00 PM. and the ballot counting is proceeding peacefully. Generally, almost all of the voters participated in this vote. Members of the Stormtroopers went to every part of the city in the afternoon to ask each household if they had voted. Until the last minute, the wireless radio station was still broadcasting and persuading people to vote, saying, "You must go and vote quickly and vote in favor of Führer Hitler's policies. It is not too late yet." A centenarian was invited to speak on the radio, urging the public to vote and asking her to express her loyalty to the National Socialist system. The old woman answered in a trembling voice, "Yes, today's Germany is very different from the past." The airship "Zeppelin" and the newly built "Hindenburg" were flying over the city of Aachen, and their crew members voted while soaring in the sky. This is a groundbreaking event in the history of German elections. Germans residing in Manchuria were concentrated in Dalian and voted on German ships. Other Germans residing abroad also voted on ships. The 4,000 Germans in Austria all went to Passau to vote, and all travel expenses were reimbursed by the German government. At about 8:00 this evening, the Propaganda Department issued a broadcast report saying that the initial results of the vote showed that the number of votes obtained by the government was far beyond official expectations, so it had to be postponed slightly. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, The first election result to be announced was from a small village in Weberstorf, where all 54 residents voted in favor of Hitler's policies at 9:40 AM. The second result to be announced was from the passengers and crew of the airship Hindenburg, a total of 104 people, who all voted in favor of Hitler's policies while flying over the Rhine River to the Saar. As time went on, the public expected that the voters in each polling station would be close to 100%, almost all voting in favor of Hitler. By 4:00 PM, all polling stations were empty, as the organization of this election was very complete, and the public had completed their voting. In front of each polling place, there was a Stormtrooper member stationed, and voters passed in front of them in an orderly fashion to enter the polling place to vote.</p>
<p>Many people who are recognized as opponents of the National Socialist Party also inadvertently voted in favor of Hitler, either because they followed the crowd or because they felt obligated to support Germany in taking a common front in foreign policy. Many people naturally believed in Hitler's guarantee of maintaining peace with honor.</p>
<p>Special arrangements were made for Germans residing outside of Germany to vote, with special trains carrying them back to the country to vote. German ships docked in various parts of the world were also converted into polling stations. After voting, each person was given a special badge, and those without this badge were not allowed to enter any entertainment venue. This is why many voters went to vote at 1:00 PM, five hours before the deadline. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, After the election ended yesterday, the public gathered in William Square at 8:00 PM, and it was extremely crowded, with women being the majority. These people stood for several hours without showing any fatigue, as the Chancellor's Office is in front of the square. The public came here to wait for Führer Hitler to appear on the balcony. At about 9:00 PM, tens of thousands of people sang patriotic songs and shouted, "Führer, please come out on the balcony so that we can see your countenance and satisfy our longing." Shortly thereafter, the Führer indeed appeared, and the cheers were thunderous. The crowd raised their hands to their foreheads, saluting in the National Socialist Party style. The scene was enthusiastic and unprecedented. People's hearts were shaken, as if they were possessed by the wind. Although the weather turned cooler at night, many people were sweating on their foreheads after being squeezed, and their faces were pale. Among them, some white-haired old women were moved to tears. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, Reuters reports from around the world on the election situation in Germany: Hundreds of Germans in northern Italy used German ships as polling stations. Germans in Cape Town, South Africa, all boarded German ships to vote. 2,000 Germans in Switzerland returned to Berlin specifically to vote. Only a dozen or so of them did not vote in favor of Hitler. The staff of the German embassy in London took a plane to Cologne to vote. Dr. Frick, the German Minister of the Interior, has notified the elected members of Congress to gather in Berlin on Tuesday to listen to Hitler's speech on the European situation, as the new Congress could not be convened on time. Propaganda Minister Goebbels issued a notice to the people of the whole country to hang flags to celebrate the victory of the National Socialist Party. Hitler met with the personnel of the election preparation office last night to thank them for their three weeks of work. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, Voters only need to write the word "Yes" or "No." "Yes" means supporting Hitler's foreign policy and electing members of the National Socialist Party to the Congress. "No" means not supporting Hitler's foreign policy, but it does not mean intending to elect non-National Socialist Party members to the Congress, as there are no non-National Socialist Party members on the list of candidates. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, After the results of the Reichstag elections were announced, the victory won by the government was confirmed. Propaganda Minister Goebbels then issued a notice to the people of the country, saying, "This victory has far-reaching significance in history. People in cities and towns should hang flags together to mark the celebration." (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, The afternoon newspaper recently published a report saying that in view of the results of the Reichstag elections, it can be seen that the German people and Führer Hitler share the same emotions. After Führer Hitler abolished the Locarno Treaty on March 7, German soldiers had already entered the Rhineland region. Now, in view of the election results, the entire German people have also walked the path of peace through the Rhineland. In other words, there is no doubt that the peace proposals put forward by Führer Hitler are the expression of the will of the entire German people. How French Prime Minister Sarraut feels about this is irrelevant. From now on, he cannot bypass Führer Hitler and speak directly to the German people, as he did on the 10th of this month. French Prime Minister Sarraut gave a speech in the French National Assembly on that day, saying, "German Führer Hitler, without going through the French government, speaks to the French people from afar, thinking that he has succeeded. We will also imitate his tone and directly announce our views to the German people." (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris, Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic reporter for the business newspaper, recently published an article commenting on the results of the German Reichstag elections, saying that Führer Hitler hopes that the results of this election, with the government winning a great victory, will deeply impress the British government and prevent it from insisting that Germany not build defensive fortifications in the Rhineland region. Mrs. Tabouis then discussed the concrete counterproposal that the German government plans to put forward on the 31st of this month, saying that this counterproposal will simply reiterate the proposals contained in the country's memorandum of the 7th of this month. In other words, it advocates concluding a mutual assistance treaty with England, France, and Belgium for a period of 25 years, and at the same time concluding non-aggression treaties with the Baltic coastal countries, as well as the Czech Republic, Austria, and other countries, without specifying a time limit. As for the proposal to convene a large-scale international conference in the spring by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, Germany intends to accept it so that the issue of reallocating colonies can be put forward for discussion.

<h3>Anglo-French-Belgian Military Liaison: British Extension Discussion - First Reviewed by Relevant Ministers</h3>
<p>The talks between the British, French, and Belgian staffs based on the Locarno Treaty, which the British Cabinet originally planned to submit for discussion today, have reportedly not been held as a formal Cabinet meeting today. Instead, they were reviewed by the relevant ministers. Those present included Prime Minister Baldwin, Naval Minister Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell, Lord Chancellor Hailsham, Minister without Portfolio Inskip (responsible for defense affairs), Foreign Secretary Eden, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Home Secretary Sir John Simon, Air Minister Lord Swinton, Lord Privy Seal Lord Halifax, and Lord President of the Council MacDonald, totaling ten people. The decisions made are not of a conclusive nature and still need to be submitted to the full Cabinet for approval. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>The Cabinet in London held a meeting of great importance regarding the general European situation today. The talks between the British, French, and Belgian staffs may take place in Brussels, Belgium, on April 6th. These staff talks will discuss the operational strategies to be adopted in the event of another European war, roughly covering the following points: cooperation among the air forces of the three countries; naval cooperation plans; once the Italo-Ethiopian War is over, Britain will withdraw most of its fleet stationed in the Mediterranean, and France will guarantee security in that region, while Britain will protect France's security in the North Sea; land force cooperation, but the British army's participation in the three countries' operational plan is only symbolic and is not intended to have any actual activity within a few years. Although these talks nominally concern all operational plans, they will only take effect if one of the three countries is attacked without cause. However, military authorities will definitely consider the military maxim of offense being better than defense. The overall authority for this plan will be controlled by the governments of the three countries, but it is believed that staff personnel should be given leeway to prepare for various military issues. Therefore, the meeting will probably discuss detailed issues such as the dispatch of British troops to Europe and Britain's request to borrow Dunkirk and Calais from France for landing purposes, so that British troops can be dispatched quickly when necessary to protect Belgium. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>After the meeting of the ten Cabinet ministers in London this morning, a certain dignitary gave an interview to our correspondent, stating that Germany is expected to present a counterproposal to the Locarno Four-Power Treaty tomorrow. Regardless of its content, the British, French, and Belgian staffs will begin talks tomorrow. As for the British and German staffs, they will also exchange information for liaison purposes once the British, French, and Belgian staff negotiations begin. In addition, the guarantee letters that the British government should present to France and Belgium (i.e., the appropriate measures that the British government should take to guarantee the security of France and Belgium) will be issued only after Germany's counterproposal is received. The dignitary also said that the British government's White Paper on the Locarno Four-Power Treaty contains an appendix stipulating that if general negotiations between the countries concerned and Germany fail, the countries should discuss mutual assistance measures. The Cabinet ministers discussed this aspect together this morning and decided that, in any case, mutual assistance measures should be limited to the Rhineland region. As for the general negotiations between Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany, they will only begin after these countries are satisfied with Germany's counterproposal, which may be presented tomorrow.

<h3>French Finance Minister Denies Franc Devaluation - Increases Interest Rates to Stabilize the Market</h3>
<p>Paris: In recent days, speculators have been selling off French francs in large quantities, causing the franc's exchange rate to fall. Yesterday, the Bank of France raised the discount rate from 3.5% to 5%. As a result, there were widespread rumors abroad that the franc was about to be devalued. At that time, there were such rumors in both the stock exchange and foreign markets. Finance Minister Régnier therefore firmly denied this this morning, saying that he would do everything possible to maintain the franc's position. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: Finance Minister Régnier gave a speech to reporters this morning, firmly denying the rumors of a franc devaluation. He said, "These rumors are purely fabricated. I have always been opposed to the devaluation of the franc, and I have not changed my original intention at this time. In May of last year, the price of the franc fluctuated once. At that time, the Bank of France immediately took various measures to maintain it. This decision to devalue the franc has the same reasons as last year. Speculators, based on false information, have tried their best to promote it, and public opinion has fallen into their trap. Even some parties that have always trusted the government now believe in rumors and propaganda that harm the interests of the country and individuals. I am really surprised." The Finance Minister then explained that the country's financial situation is very good, such as a balanced budget, abundant treasury, and the ability to cope with various financial burdens. The abundance of its gold reserves is still one of the richest in the world. At the same time, various economic activities are increasing, and agricultural product prices are also rising. All of these are evidence of financial stability, and the government will use effective methods to stop the propaganda movement of general pessimists. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: After the Bank of France increased interest rates to stabilize the market, the foreign exchange market today has shown a calmer atmosphere. This morning, the opening price of the franc against the pound continued to fall to 75.12, and the British authorities had to continue to intervene. Later, due to a slight covering by shorts, the market price temporarily returned to 75.04, but then fell to 75.10 again. The British authorities rescued the market whenever the price fell to 75.15. The quantity sold today has not been as large as recently, which proves that the concerted efforts of the French authorities to make the shorts aware that they are gradually approaching a dangerous situation have been effective. General concern about the final fate of the franc still persists, causing the exchange rate between Paris and New York to still hover around the gold export point. French bankers, for psychological reasons, have stopped shipping large amounts of cash to New York, so that the Bank of France can allocate cash to the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States to restore the balance of the franc-dollar exchange rate. Today, the British Exchange Equalisation Account was less active, which has caused the price of the dollar against the pound to return to $4.94875. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>The Pope Works 14 Hours Daily - Health Concerns Are Worrying</h3>
<p>Vatican: It was learned today that the Pope's confidants are increasingly concerned about the Pope's health. Because of his advanced age, although his physical condition is still not bad, he still works up to twelve or fourteen hours a day. However, he pays close attention to the advice of his doctors.

<h3>The First Voice of the French General Election Campaign - Flandin's Speech on Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Prepared to Participate in Any Peace Negotiations</p>
<p>But on the Basis of Restoring International Law</p>
<p>Paris: Foreign Minister Flandin gave an important speech on foreign policy at an election rally in Vitry-le-François, Marne, at 6:00 p.m. today, stating, "France is prepared to participate in any negotiations that stabilize the structure of peace, but the prerequisite is to restore the rule of international law to normal and to have a reliable basis for negotiations. The peace proposals initially put forward by Chancellor Hitler were broad in nature and unrealistic. We originally hoped that he would supplement and correct them in successive speeches. Unexpectedly, what Hitler repeatedly explained was only one point, which is very important, that is, to pit the so-called perpetual right to life of the German people against the value of treaties. What is disappointing is this. The Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact is a matter that contradicts our Locarno Pact. Since Germany refuses to submit to the Hague International Court for adjudication, and also claims that it should do whatever it wants within the country and not allow others to interfere, we should therefore raise two issues in principle and in fact:</p>
<p>If Germany retains the right to abolish any treaty by invoking the immortal outline of the law or the right to life of the German people, then what value do various treaties have in the future?</p>
<p>After a new treaty is signed with Germany in the future, if a dispute arises, what kind of judicial organ does Germany recognize as meeting the conditions of independence and impartiality? In short, it is very obvious that Germany advocates force in international life, while other countries in the world only advocate justice. These two concepts are diametrically opposed. Hitler is now engaging in diplomatic propaganda for the needs of the current situation. The word "peace" is always on his lips. He claims to want to plan 25 years of peace for Europe, and even says that he will one day establish a permanent peace system with France. Here, we cannot help but ask the question: Is Germany planning for peace by suddenly sending troops to the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland and building fortifications there? Against which country is this facility directed? What is its purpose? Since Hitler insists that peace is necessary, what does he mean by the so-called right to life and equal rights of the German people? This should be clearly defined.</p>
<p>Then, Flandin recounted that after the results of the Saar region plebiscite on January 13 last year, Hitler said that there would be no more territorial disputes between France and Germany, and reiterated the obligations of the Locarno Pact. The words are still in my ears. "At this time, is Hitler planning to wait for a suitable opportunity to use the integrity of the German people's sovereignty as an excuse to raise issues regarding the system of the Free City of Danzig? Hitler also proposed to Lithuania to conclude a non-aggression pact. Does this mean that he has definitively accepted the system of the Memel Autonomous Region, or is he deliberately cunning and reserving room for future violent actions and achieved facts? We all have the right to ask Hitler for a clear answer to all these questions. If we sit idly by and allow Germany to overturn all the results of the Treaty of Versailles without asking it to give a concrete answer, then Hitler can launch into self-praise."</p>
<p>Referring to Germany's demand for equal rights in colonies, he said, "Does Germany want to return all or part of the colonies before the European War? If it is a part, then which part? Will Hitler want to build a colonial empire for Germany in the name of developing the German people's right to life, even if it harms other nations in the future? If so, where should this empire be built, and which countries will be harmed?"</p>
<p>Flandin mentioned Hitler's proposal to conclude a 25-year non-aggression pact, saying, "Peace is a whole and cannot be broken down. How can a bilateral non-aggression pact cover it all? Suppose there is an aggressor country that has bilateral non-aggression pacts with several countries at the same time, and when it wants to attack Country A, it can stop the non-aggression pact it has signed with that country at an appropriate time to carry out a conspiracy, while maintaining the pacts it has signed with countries B and C, to be used as a talisman. If so, countries B and C are bound by it and cannot participate in collective action. As a result, the aggressor country can rest easy. The purpose of collective action is to maintain various treaties, so that they are respected and all countries, regardless of size, strength, or weakness, can enjoy security. If Hitler's intention in making this proposal is to prevent the implementation of collective action, then the new system established as a result will only make the aggressor country not afraid of being punished and make it easier to prepare for war. And even now, when Hitler is calling for peace to the world, the propaganda movement of the National Socialist Party among the German minorities in Austria, Denmark (the Schleswig province, which belonged to Germany before the war, is now partly owned by Denmark), the Silesia province of Poland (which also belonged to Germany before the war), the German minorities in Czechoslovakia, and even in the German-inhabited parts of Switzerland, has intensified. This is of great significance. Germany has long harbored the intention of annexing these places and absorbing the residents of these places. Will it abandon this idea now, or will it openly declare to the world that this is an internal matter of the German nation and that other countries cannot interfere? This is a question, yes or no, that I hope Hitler can tell me."</p>
<p>Flandin concluded that if Hitler is prepared to be open and honest and give a comprehensive explanation, he should answer each of the above questions one by one. "Hitler's peace plan is something that the whole of Europe and the world are eager to know the truth about. As for France, it advocates: first, organizing a more complete collective security system within the framework of the League of Nations in a mutually supportive manner; second, respecting treaties, and those that have changed over time and have different circumstances from the past must adopt legal amendment procedures for adjustment; third, once a security system is implemented, a large-scale disarmament plan should be implemented immediately. We are now determined to work to establish genuine and lasting peace. As for those who are accustomed to using cunning and using peace as a mask to brew new disputes and wars, we will also expose their conspiracies." (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Indian Parliament Passes Motion to Abolish the Ottawa Agreement</h3>
<p>Loopholes in the British Imperial Economic Bloc</p>

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Returns Home - Discusses the Rome Protocols</h3>
<p>Hoping Other Countries Will Follow Suit</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Prime Minister Gömbös has just returned from Rome and made a declaration on the results of his visit to Italy, saying, "The protocols signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary are of great significance. What is the significance? Even though the European situation is extremely confusing, if Italy, Austria, and Hungary can unite, they can create an island of peace in the midst of storms and waves, and use the power of peace work to guide European countries into a prosperous path.

<h3>Polish Envoy Zhang Gives Speech on Modern Chinese Culture - East and West Academic Studies Influence Each Other</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Chinese Envoy Zhang Xin Hai recently gave a speech here on "Modern Chinese Culture." Representatives from the Polish scientific and literary circles, diplomatic corps, and many listeners attended the speech. The topic was the influence of Europe on the Chinese scientific community and the influence of Chinese culture on the world, stating, "China has always been happy to accept the strengths of various countries in the world. China has absorbed European science for this reason. Now that China has recognized its own strength, it can absorb as much European scientific knowledge as possible. As for the influence of Chinese culture on Europe, the monism advocated by the German philosopher Leibniz (1646-1716) was derived from Chinese culture. The physiocracy advocated by the famous French economist Quesnay (1694-1774) and the theory of the general physiocrats were also inherited from Chinese theories. In addition, the fine arts and interior decoration skills of various European countries have been greatly influenced by Chinese fine arts. The works of the famous French painter and sculptor Watteau and the British artist Corson are examples of this." (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Norway Replaces its Envoy to China</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Norwegian Envoy to China, Gullen, who also serves as Envoy to Siam and Japan, has traveled east by Dutch mail ship from Marseille and has arrived in Singapore. He will take a train directly to Siam, present his credentials, and then come to China to take up his new post. (Special Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Diplomatic circles have learned that the Norwegian Envoy to China, Ober, has been transferred. The Norwegian government has appointed the country's Envoy to Portugal, Golan, to succeed him as Envoy to China, Siam, and Japan, and has obtained the consent of our government. Golan traveled east from Marseille last month to take up his post and has reportedly already arrived in Singapore to go to Siam. After presenting his credentials in Siam, he will come to China. Golan previously served as a secretary at the Norwegian Embassy in Japan and is very familiar with the situation in the Far East. The Norwegian government originally planned to establish embassies in China and Japan separately, but it was unable to do so due to limited funds. After Golan presents his credentials in China, he will go to Japan to present his credentials again and then travel around China to study Chinese culture. Because Golan is a concurrent envoy, the affairs of the embassy will be handled by the Consul General in Shanghai, Huali, when he is not in China. (Central News Agency Telegram, 30th)</p>

<h3>The Importance and Implementation of the Baojia System (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Li Songfeng, Director of the Police Affairs Department, Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>Observing from the perspective of promoting local self-government—for a country to exist, its people must be organized. To build a modern nation, the people must have the knowledge and ability to exercise political power. This knowledge and ability to exercise political power require training. The self-government system we are currently adopting serves both as a basic local organization and as a means to train the people to exercise political power. Therefore, it is essential to make the completion of self-government our standard for implementing constitutional government. In the journey toward constitutional government, we cannot relax our efforts to promote local self-government. But how should we promote it? We must research the best methods. Why has local self-government, after seven years of implementation, not yielded greater results? The main reason is that it has failed to adequately meet the urgent demands of the people. The desire to exercise political power arises only after life is stable. If order is not maintained and the people cannot live and work in peace, promoting self-government will naturally be difficult. Therefore, to promote self-government, we must first start by stabilizing social order. As mentioned above, since the Baojia system is a tool for safeguarding security, if implemented effectively, it will naturally contribute to the advancement of self-government. Conversely, if the Baojia movement does not succeed and social order is not easily restored, then completing local self-government is simply a dream!</p>
<p>Observing from the perspective of completing production and construction—China's weakness is mainly due to the decline of its industries. Therefore, to revitalize China, we must start with production and construction. How should we engage in production and construction? This requires the joint efforts of the entire nation; however, efforts in production and construction must also have an organization to take responsibility for promotion, and nothing is better than the "Baojia." For example, improving agricultural production methods, organizing various cooperatives, building roads, dredging rivers, and preparing for famine relief…etc., are all undertakings that the Baojia can be responsible for handling. Moreover, it is easier to achieve results when it is handled by the Baojia. Recently, various provinces have often utilized large-scale conscripted labor to complete great projects such as dike construction (like the North Jiangsu dike last year) and river dredging. The biggest reason for this is the existence of a well-organized Baojia system. The labor service currently being promoted in various provinces is also a step in production and construction. In this step, we still cannot be separated from the Baojia organization. From this, we can also see the importance of the relationship between the Baojia and production and construction.</p>
<p>Observing from the perspective of promoting mass education—China's lack of universal education is the main reason for the difficulty in promoting all undertakings. Therefore, universal education, especially mass education, is truly an urgent task. However, universal implementation is not an easy task! If we can use the Baojia to promote mass education, it will also be easy to achieve results. Because the Baojia organization requires everyone to participate and is closely related to everyone, if we make the Baojia chief responsible for promoting social education, it will certainly be easy to achieve results. Moreover, this kind of social education can also be implemented using the Baojia training method, so that no one can be an exception. Successful Baojia training also brings about the effect of social education. From the perspective of social education, this must be said to be an economical and effective method. Recently, some places are establishing "Bao Schools," making close connections between schools and the Baojia. This is something that deserves attention.</p>
<p>Observing from the perspective of facilitating the implementation of government orders—Some people say that the political organization of the past was top-heavy and bottom-light. We believe that it can be said to have a head but no tail, that is, having an upper layer but no foundation. For example, a government order, from the central government to the provincial government, and then to the county government, is considered to have reached the final agency. At most, the county government only forwards it to the police districts, and it never reaches the people. Even if a public notice is issued as usual, given the general education situation in China, how many people can understand it? How many of those who understand it will pay attention to the notice? With such a top-heavy and bottom-light organization, to say that government orders can be implemented smoothly is truly questionable! What happens after there is a Baojia? From the county down to the district, to the Bao, to the Jia, all the way to the household, and reaching each individual; in this way, the transmission of government orders reaches its final destination, and only then can we truly talk about the effect of implementing government orders. For example, taking conscripted labor as an example, if there is no Baojia organization, the county government must allocate it itself. If people do not come, the county government must be responsible for urging them separately. Not only is it difficult for the county government, which has few people and many things to do, to undertake this, but also because supervision is insufficient, the effect is certainly not good. But with the Baojia organization, as long as it is allocated to each Bao and each Jia, each Bao and Jia will be responsible for allocating, managing, and supervising it, and they can supervise each other, and the effect is very easy to achieve.</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the more important matters selected to illustrate the importance of the Baojia system; because the functions of the Baojia are multifaceted, there are many more that should be explained. However, due to time constraints, I will not go into detail here.</p>
<p>3. Implementation of the Baojia Movement</p>
<p>How should the Baojia movement be implemented? This is not a simple matter; its scope is very broad. However, we believe that the four points of system, personnel, undertaking, and funding are the most important. Below, we will discuss these four points separately:</p>
<p>1. Establishment of a Rational System—If you want the Baojia movement to easily achieve results, you must first strive for perfection in the Baojia system itself. An irrational system, no matter how hard you work, will not be easy to implement. How should a rational Baojia system be established? I believe the most important points are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The nature must be determined—It seems that the nature of the Baojia has not yet been determined; some say it is completely a self-defense organization, some say it is part of the self-government organization, some say the Baojia is only an emergency organization, and some say the Baojia and the self-government organization can coexist permanently… There are many different opinions, which is naturally due to the uncertain nature of the Baojia. I believe that if the nature of the Baojia cannot be determined as soon as possible, this is the biggest obstacle to promoting the Baojia. How to determine it? I believe the best way is to follow the opinion of the Ministry of Interior and simply merge the Baojia into the self-government organization, replacing the neighborhood system. As a subdivision under the township district, determine the nature of the Baojia as part of the local government. In this way, it will be easier to promote it with a proper name and reason.</p>
<p>(B) The system must be clear—In the bandit suppression zones, the current Baojia system in each province is that Jia belongs to Bao, Bao belongs to District, District belongs to County, and each Bao can organize Joint Bao. In other provinces, Bao belongs to township, and township belongs to District and County, while others Bao and Jia belong to township, and township belongs to County; there are also those who take Joint Bao as a fixed organization, regarding it as an intermediate organization between District and Baojia; even more, those who organize Joint Bao, Big Bao above Bao, and belong to County… The methods are not unified, and the system is not clear. There is a real need for unified organization. I believe the best way is to follow the organization stipulated in the draft of the County Self-Government Law, where the level below the county is the township district level, and the divisions within the township district are Bao and Jia. Joint Bao is not set up above Bao, and its tasks can be handled by the township district. The scope of the township district can be flexible. The result is County – Township District – Bao – Jia, a simple and clear system. As for the fact that there are too many township district units and it is difficult for the county government to supervise, it may be possible to set up administrative districts (Tiqu Office) under the county as relief, without counting it in the self-government organization.

<h3>Random Talk on Art: Painting Comes After the Plain Ground</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Zi Xia asked, "What is meant by 'Her artful smile dimples, Her beautiful eyes glance, The plain ground makes the painting lovely'?" The Master said, "Painting comes after the plain ground." He said, "Does ritual come after?" The Master said, "It is Shang who can uplift me. Now I can begin to discuss the Odes with you."</p>
<p>Confucius wanted to explain to Zi Xia the principle that "people must first have beautiful qualities before they can be adorned with embellishments," but he used "painting comes after the plain ground" as an analogy. Confucius himself said, "I am skilled in many things but despise petty affairs." Perhaps he was also proficient in painting and knew the hardships involved, so he simply stated these four words as an analogy.</p>
<p>"Painting comes after the plain ground" means that there must first be a white ground before painting can begin. This is clearly a unique characteristic of Chinese painting. It is not easily understood by Westerners because their paintings, before the Renaissance, were mainly frescoes, and after the Renaissance, mainly oil paintings. Neither requires a white ground.</p>
<p>A fresco is a type of watercolor painting that uses glue and powder. It is mostly painted on walls, so it may simply be called a mural. Before the Renaissance, the influence of Christianity in Europe was strong, and almost all the subjects depicted were religious paintings. The greatest painting projects were murals in monasteries. Although oil painting had been invented during the Renaissance, many great painters still used the fresco technique to create murals for monasteries. Michael Angelo was one of the most famous. This technique has several drawbacks: first, writing is not free; second, after the glue loses its properties, it is prone to cracking or peeling, making it difficult to preserve. Therefore, at the turn of the Renaissance, someone invented oil painting. This method uses oil to mix materials, which can be freely altered at any time and is very strong and easy to preserve after drying. Thus, fresco gave way to oil painting. For the past few hundred years, oil paint has been the only pigment that has dominated the Western painting world. Both of these pigments are mixed with powder, so they are opaque and have covering power. Green can be painted on a red ground, and white can be painted on a black ground. Exaggeratedly speaking, this method of writing is like a painter painting a board wall. The paint is like oil paint (and is actually oil paint mixed with lead powder; if Chinese lacquer is used, it is still somewhat transparent and cannot cover the wood grain), and the writing brush is like a paint brush. To exaggerate further, this method of writing is like a plasterer building a brick wall. The paint is like lime mud, and the paintbrush is like a trowel. Therefore, the ground for Western paintings does not necessarily have to be white. In any case, the pigments are thick and have covering power, and the entire surface is painted, leaving no blank space, so the color of the ground is not a problem; anything is possible. Today's Chinese painting students are also using oil paint to smear. If you look at the canvases they use, they are mostly dark yellow or light blue-gray. Although some new-style painting methods imitate the Chinese "painting comes after the plain ground" and leave some blank space on the canvas, it is not very natural, and very few people practice it. In short, Western "painting," in terms of tools and techniques, does not necessarily "come after the plain ground."</p>
<p>Conversely, Chinese painting must "come after the plain ground." Plain paper in Chinese painting is not just a ground; in fact, it plays a very important role in the expression of painting. Please look at Chinese paintings; most of them use very little ink, or even just a few strokes. The white space outside the few strokes is definitely not ordinary waste paper; it often has a clever effect on the layout of the painting. This is called "emptiness." Emptiness then has "vitality." In the past, people discussed poetry and prose and said, "All the good points of poetry and prose lie in 'emptiness.' It is like a room where people can rest and relax. What they rest and relax in is the 'empty' space. If it is suffocated and blocked, even if there are gold and jade filling the hall, there is no place to put this body, how can there be joy of wealth and honor? A bell that is not empty is mute. An ear that is not empty is deaf." These metaphors can be used in Chinese painting. A certain foreign cartoonist satirized a merchant by saying: a merchant asked a certain great painter to make a vertical painting and sent 60 yuan as remuneration. When he took the painting, he saw that only three jagged beans were drawn at the bottom of the long vertical painting, and a line of inscription was written on the top edge. The rest was all blank paper. The merchant calculated on the abacus, "Three times one is thirty-one," and said, "One bean is worth twenty yuan, the market price is too expensive!" This statement, although satirizing ignorant merchants, also satirizes Chinese calligraphy on the one hand. Drawing three beans in a long vertical painting is perhaps an exaggeration; but drawing two cabbages, or several chickens, or a rock alone is indeed common in Chinese painting. In short, Chinese painting screens are mostly lightly inked with plenty of blank space, which is completely different from Western oil paintings, which are painted all over. Western watercolor paintings are also painted on plain paper. However, because the painting methods are different and the smearing is severe, the blank space left is far less than that of Chinese paintings. Moreover, sometimes white powder is also used in watercolor paints to make them opaque, and they are applied in dabs. Furthermore, in Western painting, compared to oil painting, it is only considered a minor path and cannot represent Western painting.</p>
<p>What are the differences in art between "painting comes after the plain ground" and "painting does not come after the plain ground"? In my opinion, painting that comes after the plain ground is richer in artistic intent. The so-called "artistic intent" is "artistic flavor." In simple terms, it is "not pretending to be a real object, but frankly stating that it is a painting." According to the facts, there must be something around the objects in the painting. A table, a wall, or the sky, in short, there should be something, which is called the "background." Western paintings are faithful to reality. All paintings must have a background, and the background is also part of the composition. That is why they want to paint the entire surface. Chinese paintings, on the other hand, mostly have no background, and the objects hang in the air. A rock, an orchid, or a beauty is suspended in the air. All around them is the plain ground of the paper. This is like a phenomenon suddenly appearing in the endless white clouds. Therefore, this phenomenon gives people a strong visual stimulus. This clearly states that it is not a real object, but a "painting." Western paintings are not like this. Realistic oil paintings are painted in fine detail, so that they look exactly like real objects. If such an oil portrait is hung in a dark corner of a room, a stranger may see it and nod and bow to it, and even ask for its name. This method is close to "pretending to be a real object." This kind of painting does not look like a "painting" or a "work of art." Therefore, when it comes to "artistic intent" and "artistic flavor," Chinese painting is much richer than Western painting.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Painting comes after the plain ground," which means that people must first have beautiful qualities before they can be adorned with embellishments, just as painting must first have a "plain ground" before "color" can be applied. I think that if color is not applied to the plain ground and only black is used, according to the above reasoning, it should be richer in "artistic intent" and "artistic flavor." Therefore, the status of "ink painting" is very high in Chinese painting. Landscapes, plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, rocks... there has never been a shortage of famous ink paintings. Fundamentally speaking, since painting does not want to pretend to be a real object, it may as well exclude color and use black ink. According to the theory of color: black is formed by mixing equal amounts of the three primary colors of red, yellow, and blue, in which all three primary colors are present. Using black, which contains all three primary colors, to paint on a white plain ground that does not absorb any of the three primary colors, the color coordination is very saturated, and the color contrast is very strong, so it can originally be done without the help of other colors.</p>
<p>I heard that the woodblock prints that the Soviet Union recently brought to Shanghai for exhibition were highly praised by the people of Shanghai. Some praised them for being "powerful," some read them as "having life," and others praised them as being "revolutionary." I have not seen them, so I cannot say. But I know that printmaking is painting with black ink printed on a plain ground, which is a type of "ink painting." I expect that it is not a painting that seeks to pretend to be a real object, but a work rich in "artistic intent" and "artistic flavor." Woodblock prints have been popular in China for thousands of years. In the West, it developed in modern times. This can be said to be an oriental style of painting. Seen in this way, "painting comes after the plain ground" is entirely a method unique to oriental painting, but it has now been broadcast in Western Europe and will soon be popularized throughout the world.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Painting comes after the plain ground," using the idea that painting "must first have a plain ground before color can be applied" to compare with the human life's "must first have beautiful qualities, then can add literary adornment." The culture of a nation often has blood connections, forming a consistent phenomenon. The Western painting does not need to "come after the plain ground," which makes me suspect that Western life does not need to have beautiful qualities first, but can be completely covered with literary adornment. Beautiful qualities are spiritual, and literary adornment is technical. The divergence of Eastern and Western cultures probably lies in this.</p>

<h3>Tea Party of the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Japan to Welcome Ambassador Xu</h3>
<p>— Tokyo Communication</p>
<p>Adhering to Government Instructions and Based on National Will</p>
<p>Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations and Promoting Amity Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Holding Greatest Determination Not to Do Anything Disgraceful</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Japan held a tea party to welcome Ambassador Xu on the afternoon of March 22 at 2 p.m. inside the Toyoken Restaurant in 1-chome, Yurakucho, Kojimachi District, Tokyo. During the tea party, Ambassador Xu gave a reply speech, which stated: "Chairman, fellow-provincials, and students, I am very ashamed to receive such praise from the Chairman just now. I am very grateful to have so many fellow-provincials gather to welcome me today. This is my first time coming to Japan. When a person first arrives in a foreign country, they always miss their motherland and hometown very much. It is rare to have the opportunity to meet with fellow-provincials overseas. Meeting with fellow-provincials overseas is like meeting family, fathers, sons, and brothers. It is the most joyful thing. Today, I am very happy and gratified to be able to gather with so many fellow-provincials. As the Chairman said, this is the first time an Anhui person has been appointed as an ambassador. Actually, there was Li Boxing, a native of Anhui, who was sent to Japan as an envoy 40 years ago. And Duke Li Wenzhong was a veteran in diplomacy. All diplomats must have diplomatic skills, techniques, and eloquence to be competent. I have neither diplomatic skills nor techniques, and I am not good at eloquence. I am really an amateur in diplomacy. This time, I accepted the appointment only because I could not refuse the government's order. I am afraid that I will fail to live up to the great responsibility in the future. However, I have heard people say that diplomacy sometimes uses cleverness and deceit, and sometimes uses clumsiness and trust. Cleverness and deceit may succeed sometimes, but clumsiness and trust will never deviate from justice. I am not good at being clever, and I am afraid that I will be clumsy in the future. I will not be fraudulent, or I may be too trusting. But to seek the happiness of mankind, we must first maintain world peace. To maintain world peace, we must first maintain peace in East Asia. To maintain peace in East Asia, we must first achieve an equal and reasonable adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations to promote amity between the two countries, which will naturally enhance the feelings between the people of the two countries. This time, I will adhere to the government's instructions and act according to the will of the people to handle Sino-Japanese diplomacy. No matter what the environment, I will never violate the government's principles and the people's expectations. At the same time, I also hold the greatest determination, which is that I will never do anything disgraceful! (Applause) I can sacrifice my life, but I must never sacrifice my lifelong reputation and personality! (Applause) In the broad sense, I cannot let the Republic of China be disgraced! (Applause) In the narrow sense, I cannot let Anhui be disgraced! (Applause) Regarding this point, I can tell my fellow-provincials. Today, Chairman Jiang is a veteran diplomat and an expert. And some of you fellow-provincials have been in Japan for ten or eight years, and some have been here for three or five years. At least you have all come here earlier than me. I hope you will give me more guidance in the future. Please tell me everything you see. Also, students, you must study hard so that you can fulfill your obligations and responsibilities to the country in the future. Although everyone studies different subjects, you will all be the backbone of the country in the future. Now, everyone should encourage each other, learn from each other, and follow the eight characters of 'respecting work, enjoying community, loving each other.' As for the method of being a person, I once collected a couplet, which I now offer to you for reference. The first line is what Confucius said, and the second line is what Mencius said. I linked them together and found it very natural. The first line is 'To love learning is close to wisdom, to practice diligently is close to benevolence, to know shame is close to courage, then one can govern the world.' The second line is 'Wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and meanness cannot move, power and violence cannot subdue. This is called a great man.' I hope that you can all follow this couplet to be a person. Finally, my student Huang Bodu, whose respected elder in his hometown, Mr. Zhiqing, accompanied Duke Li Wenzhong to Japan and participated in Mr. Boxing's mission to the East. He also stayed with him for several years. But he has long forgotten the Japanese he learned as a child. This time, he came to Japan to serve with me. I hope that everyone present today can be his teacher and guide him at any time. I do not dare to accept the words of encouragement that the Chairman just said to him. Finally, I wish all fellow-provincials good health and wish all students study hard, improve their virtue, and improve their studies."</p>
<h3>Four More People Arrested in Hong Kong in the Wang Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Conspiring to Assassinate Song Ziwen and Members of the League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<p>After Extradition and Return, the Court Will Investigate and Prosecute</p>
<p>The six accomplices in the assassination of the former President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi, have been arrested and transferred to the court. The Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has appointed Prosecutor Luo Renji to investigate and file a public prosecution. The original indictment of the prosecutor was published on the afternoon of the 30th. According to the confessions of Zhang and He, Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Hua Kezhi, etc. were instructed by Chen and Li to plan and carry out the assassination. They had a central assassination organization in Hong Kong and had formed a gang to assassinate former Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station in Shanghai, killing Song's secretary and a bodyguard on the spot. They had also conspired to assassinate members of the League of Nations investigation team who came to China, but failed. Yu Likui personally directed the assassination of former Finance Minister Song at the time. In addition, Wang Yaqiao had many followers, and his most important cadres, such as Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and Zhang Zhihan, were hiding in the central organization in Hong Kong, planning assassinations for Wang. They contributed a lot to the sniper attack on the former President of the Executive Yuan. Based on the above clues, the government immediately notified the Hong Kong government, ordered their arrest, and sent personnel to assist in the search. Yu Likui, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, and Zhang Zhihan have been arrested, and much evidence of their planning of assassinations has been found in their organization. They are all currently detained by the Hong Kong government and may be extradited back to China soon for investigation. It is said that the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which is handling the case, will try the four criminals Yu, Hu, Zhou, and Zhang in a separate case. As soon as the four criminals are extradited, they will be investigated and prosecuted according to law. A copy of Zhang Yuhua's confession at the Capital Police Department has been found and is published below.</p>
<p>Record of Interrogation</p>
<p>November 18, 24th Year of the Republic of China, in the First Tribunal of the Judicial Section of the Capital Police Department, the attending officers are as follows: Examining Officer Shen Siding, Recorder Yan Dongkui. This case involves the joint conspiracy to assassinate the President of the Executive Yuan. Zhang Yuhua (also known as Zhang Wei) is brought into the court. Asked: Name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation? Answered: Zhang Yuhua, real name Zhang Wei, alias Siming, 29 years old, from Gaoyou, Jiangsu Province, studied at Jinling University in Nanjing, and once served as a teacher at Baoying County Middle School in Jiangsu Province, reporter for the Southeast News Agency in Nanjing, and reporter for the Chenguang News Agency. Asked: Who were the masterminds of the assassination of the President of the Executive Yuan? Answered: Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Hua Kezhi, etc. Asked: Who are Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui? Answered: Wang Yaqiao is from Anhui, nicknamed Lao Jiu. Yu Likui, also known as Li Zi'an, once formed a gang to assassinate Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station in Shanghai, killing Song's secretary and a bodyguard. Yu Likui was present to direct the assassination. They had also conspired to assassinate members of the League of Nations investigation team who came to China, but failed. Our actions to assassinate President Wang were directed by Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi. Asked: Who is Hua Kezhi? Answered: Hua Kezhi, also known as Hua Junshi, is from Baoying, Jiangsu Province, and goes by the alias Hu Yunqing. He is the president of the Chenguang News Agency. Nominally, it is a news agency, but in reality, it is a cover for an assassination organization. The entire plan and actions of Sun Fengming's pistol assassination of President Wang in Beijing were instigated by Hua Kezhi together with Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui. Asked: When did this attempt begin? Answered: As early as around the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. Asked: Where was the plan made at that time? Answered: It was planned at Yu Likui's home in Taoyuan Village, Lafayette Road, Shanghai (the house number is unclear). Asked: Who were the people who participated in planning the assassination at that time? Answered: The people who participated were Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Sun Fengming, Xu Zhiyuan, Hua Kezhi, Wang Yaqiao's brother-in-law, and myself. The most radical at the time were Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi. Therefore, it was decided to carry out the assassination of Chairman Chiang and President Wang, with Wang, Yu, and Hua in charge of everything. Asked: How was the method of assassination decided? Answered: Everyone decided at Yu Likui's home in Shanghai to take over the Southeast News Agency in Nanjing as a cover and as a liaison for communication between Shanghai and Nanjing. Asked: What was the process of the assassination like? Answered: Because the assassination by the Southeast News Agency failed, the Nanjing Chenguang News Agency was established in the autumn of last year (23rd year) to strive for the realization of the assassination. In November, during the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, He Poguang, Sun Fengming, and I were ordered by Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi to go to the Central Party Headquarters to take the opportunity to assassinate Chairman Chiang. Sun Fengming carried a pistol. On that day, Chairman Chiang left the meeting due to a toothache before the meeting ended. At this time, Chairman Chiang got into the car. The three of us, Sun, He, and I, were next to the car, very close to Chairman Chiang. However, we had no determination at that time, so we did not act. Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui were dissatisfied because our assassination failed. Wang and Yu sent Hua Kezhi to the Nanjing Chenguang News Agency to question us first, and then wanted to stop the funding. In the spring of this year, Yu Likui, Wang Yaqiao, and Hua Kezhi summoned me to Hong Kong. I went with Sun Fengming and Guo Huizhong. After meeting with Wang and Yu in Hong Kong, we returned to Nanjing. Therefore, it was decided to carry out the assassination at the 6th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. A week before the incident, Hua Kezhi, under the instructions of Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui, brought Sun Fengming from Shanghai to Beijing to stay at the Chenguang News Agency to discuss the assassination plan. Sun Fengming obtained an entry permit in the name of a reporter for the Chenguang News Agency. The target of the assassination was still Chairman Chiang and President Wang. On November 1st, at the opening ceremony of the meeting, after the photography was completed, Sun Fengming followed the predetermined plan and opened fire on President Wang, hitting him. Chairman Chiang was not present, so he only targeted President Wang. If Chiang had been present, he would not have escaped. Asked: What was it like when you and Sun Fengming went to Hong Kong? Answered: Sun Fengming, Guo Huizhong, and I went to Hong Kong this spring and stayed at the Luk Hoi Tong Hotel. On the third day, Wang, Sun Fengming, etc. talked at the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce. Yu Likui, Hua Kezhi, Wang Renshan, and I were present. Asked: What was the content of the conversation? Answered: Wang Yaqiao exhorted Sun Fengming to be determined in doing things. At the same time, Yu Likui also encouraged Sun Fengming, saying that we decided on the assassination plan in Shanghai, but it has not been realized yet. It is really shameful. This major event depends entirely on you, brother. Asked: How did you get to know Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi? Answered: Hua Kezhi and I were classmates in our youth and have a good relationship. Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui were introduced to me by Hua Kezhi. We became friends in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China. Asked: Where did the gun that Sun Fengming used to commit the crime come from? Answered: This gun was brought by Hua Kezhi. Asked: Who are Wang Yaqiao's associates and their addresses? Answered: Wang Yaqiao's cadres in Shanghai are Cai Daohe, Xu Zhiyuan, and Hua Kezhi. Those who went to Hong Kong from Shanghai are Zhang Xianting, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, Zhang Zhihan, etc. They specialize in planning assassinations and worked hard on the assassination of the President of the Executive Yuan. Asked: Who are the internal staff of the Chenguang News Agency? Answered: The president of the Chenguang News Agency is Hu Yunqing, also known as Hua Kezhi, but Hua is often not at the agency. I am the acting president. The editor-in-chief is He Poguang. The reporters are Sun Fengming and Liu Shurong. Asked: Why is Hua Kezhi not often at the Chenguang News Agency? Answered: Hua Kezhi lives in Shanghai because it is convenient for him to contact Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui, so he often stays in Shanghai. Asked: Hua Kezhi came to Beijing on October 24th and brought Sun Fengming to the Chenguang News Agency to discuss the assassination. How did you plan and arrange it, and where did he go after that? Answered: Hua Kezhi and Sun Fengming came to Beijing this time, and Sun immediately became determined, unlike his previous timidity. The four of us, Hua, Sun, He, and I, had a meeting in the agency and decided that Hua would first return to Shanghai to go to Hong Kong to contact Wang and Yu. I went to Shanghai the day before to arrange accommodations for everyone. He escorted Sun to the Central Party Headquarters and then took a car to Zhenjiang to return to Shanghai. We burned all the documents in the agency to destroy the evidence. The rest of the people in the agency went to Shanghai in two or three days. Asked: Are all the above words true? Answered: They are indeed true. I am willing to make a confession, but I was really instigated by them. Please investigate clearly. The right record was read aloud in court, and the person being interrogated confirmed that there were no discrepancies before being ordered to sign and seal it before leaving the court. Zhang Yuhua.

<h3>Japanese Merchant Recruits 20,000 Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>Via Gubeikou to Jinzhou for Mining and Road Construction</p>
<p>Peiping's Economic Downturn Causes Significant Losses for Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The Sino-Japanese economic cooperation issue has been dormant for months, but Japanese goods flood the markets of Peiping and Tianjin, with very low prices. Recently, affected by the Shanxi war, shops in Peiping's Dong'an Market, Xidan Shopping Center, Quanye Emporium, Qianmen Street, and Wangfujing Street have been closing down one after another, causing an unusual economic downturn. Japanese goods have also suffered losses, but Japanese merchants continue to transport goods and seek ways to sell them. Domestically produced goods, except for the well-known cloisonné and carpets, can barely maintain business; others find it difficult to continue operating. Even rice shops are closing down one after another, mainly because the population of Peiping has decreased, with many southerners returning south or going to the northwest to seek a living.</p>
<p>For the sake of developing Northeast China, the Japanese merchant Okura &amp; Co. is currently recruiting 20,000 Chinese laborers in the Baoding and Zhengding areas. It is said that most applicants are farmers. Once farmers change their profession, the future of agriculture in Hebei is a cause for great concern. It is also reported that the company has established an office in Taihe Store in Gubeikou and is working actively. The Chinese laborers recruited in Baoding and Zhengding have already arrived in Gubeikou on foot to register, and work permits have been issued. The Japanese side will send them to the Jinzhou area for mining and road construction. The Japanese side has also drafted a two-year plan. (29th)</p>
<h3>Gansu Provincial Government to Abolish Excessive Taxes in Three Phases</h3>
<p>County Administration Reorganization: Departments Merged, Sections Combined</p>
<p>Planning Relief for Fleeing Residents</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: The Gansu province is abolishing excessive taxes in phases. The first and second phases were implemented successively on January 7 of last year. Chairman Yu recently ordered the Department of Finance to formulate the third phase of taxes to be abolished for review. The list was then submitted to the government and approved at the 390th Provincial Affairs Conference. A total of 41 special tax items will be abolished, with annual tax revenue of 61,936 yuan, 3 jiao, 1 fen, and 3 li. A total of 4 ticket price items will be abolished, with annual tax revenue of 28,284 yuan. The two items total 45 types, with an annual reduction of 90,220 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen, and 3 li. Since the combined office operation in Gansu Province, administrative efficiency has significantly improved. If the administrative organization of each county still follows the old system, not only will power not be unified, but it will also be difficult to achieve consistent administrative effectiveness between the province and the counties. Chairman Yu believes that in order to seek sound county administration and enhance administrative efficiency, the current county administrative organization needs to be reformed. However, since this involves all local administrative affairs and is a pioneering effort in the province, if the implementation methods are not carefully considered in advance, it may be difficult to achieve perfection afterward. It is reported that he has ordered various departments to send personnel to discuss and formulate methods together in order to begin implementation.</p>
<p>The counties of Xi'an and Yumen in Gansu Province are barren and the people are poor. In addition, disasters have occurred frequently in recent years, resulting in widespread devastation. Recently, residents in the area are finding it difficult to make a living, leading to more fleeing. After receiving the report, Chairman Yu was deeply concerned. In addition to ordering the Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance to jointly formulate relief measures, it is reported that Civil Affairs Director Liu Guangpei will be sent to Anxi and Yumen to investigate and seek fundamental solutions.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Plans Water and Forest Conservation in the East and Han Rivers</h3>
<p>Reforestation Area of 1.5 Million Mu</p>
<p>Expected to be Completed in Fifteen Years</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: To prevent floods and benefit farmland, the Guangdong Provincial Construction Authorities have drafted a general outline for the management of water source forests in the East and Han Rivers, which has been submitted to the Political Research Council for review. Once the review is completed, it will be submitted to the Provincial Government for review and will be included in the second phase of the three-year administrative plan for step-by-step implementation. The following is an outline of the plan: The scope of management of water source forests in the East and Han Rivers: In the East River area: 1. Forested areas: The scope includes bamboo and timber forests in Dasan, Xixi, Shilongzhai, Zhangmuling and other places in Beiling Sanxikou, as well as forests along the banks of Jigongzhang, Yihe, Huangtian, Lankou, Zhongxin and other places in Heyuan. 2. Reforestation areas: The scope includes Diaoyu Weng in Huiyang, Jigongzhang and Guiling in Heyuan, Baiyun Mountain, Nanshan, Apoji Ridge in Longchuan, and barren mountains along the river. 3. Sand control areas: The scope includes Chentian in Longchuan and Tianhua in Dingnan County, Jiangxi. In the Han River area: 1. Forested areas: The scope includes forests in Hengkeng, Bindong, Huangtian, Qiuxi, Liukeng, Taojunzhang and other places in Zijin, as well as the Tiechi Ridge and other forests in Longchuan. 2. Reforestation areas: The scope includes Luzizhang and Taojunzhang in Zijin, Qiling and Banzi Gang in Wuhua, Shenguang Mountain in Xingning, Huangshazhang in Meixian, and barren mountains along the river. 3. Sand control areas: The scope includes the central dam in Zijin, the collapsing mountains near Wuhua City, the collapsing mountains in Dalongtian in Xingning, and Shenguang Mountain. Types of water source forests and forest management methods: (A) Types of water source forests: 1. Absolute water source forests: Forests that have a significant relationship with water source conservation or soil and sand control shall be classified as water source conservation forests and logging shall be absolutely prohibited. 2. Relative water source forests: Although these forests are not as important as the former, they are also related. It is appropriate to restrict their operation, prohibit clear-cutting, and allow selective cutting to avoid temporary abandonment of forest land, resulting in the danger of collapsing mountains. (B) Forest management methods: 1. Direct management: Forests directly managed by the government, such as the absolute water source forests in the previous paragraph, must be directly managed by the government. Regardless of whether the forests are public or private, the government will take over and directly manage them. Regardless of whether the barren mountains are public or private, the government will consider the situation, formulate an operation plan, and directly reforest them. 2. Subsidized management: Under the supervision and guidance of the government, funds are subsidized, or seedlings are given, and the county government is responsible for encouraging people, individuals, or groups to manage them. The relative water source forests mentioned above can also be managed in this way. 3. Collapsing mountain reforestation: This type of mountain land is extremely important in relation to water sources, and its facilities cannot be implemented in the same way as regular methods. A detailed engineering plan must be formulated, sand control projects must be implemented, and then reforestation must be carried out. (C) Estimated time limit for completion of reforestation: The reforestation area of barren mountains in the water source areas of the two rivers is 1.5 million mu. Each year, the government and the people will reforest 50,000 mu each (an average of 300 trees per mu), for a total of 100,000 mu. It is estimated that the entire project can be completed in fifteen years.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Opening of the Sujia Railway Imminent</p>
<p>The roadbed construction of the Sujia Railway, built by the Ministry of Railways, has long been completed. Currently, the tracks are being laid. The section from Suzhou to Wujiang has been completely laid. It is expected that the entire line will be laid by April 15. Except for the Yishan Township Bridge at the junction of Wuxian and Wujiang, which has not yet been completed, all other bridges have been completed. It has now been decided to open the railway to traffic on May 1. The stations in Sujia, Wujiang, Shengze and other places are under construction separately. Once the station buildings are completed, passenger and freight trains will be officially operated. The Wuxian County Government recently received a letter from the Railway Bureau requesting an investigation into the industrial, commercial, and rural conditions along the Sujia Railway. County Magistrate Deng specially convened the heads of the first and second districts at the county government at 10:00 a.m. on the 30th for a meeting. County Magistrate Deng personally inquired about everything for reference.</p>
<h3>Shen Yuankai Accuses His Wife of Adultery</h3>
<p>Shen Yuankai, a young and handsome former lawyer, has a Shenwanxing shipyard outside Xumen. He married Wu Cuqin. Due to marital differences, Shen took a concubine, Ye Caiying, when he served as a Chengzhai member in Qingpu County last year. Upon hearing this, Wu went to negotiate and burned three pairs of Caiying's high-heeled leather shoes and took her clothes back to Wuxi. Ye and others then sued Wu in Wuxi for damaging (referring to burning the high-heeled leather shoes) and stealing (referring to the clothes). Later, the case was tried by the Wuxian District Court. Wu also sued her husband and concubine for assault. Shen's younger sister, Jingzhen, joined the case and accused Wu of insult, becoming a multi-sided lawsuit. Subsequently, in the damage, theft, and assault cases, the Suzhou High Court ruled that Wu Qunqin was exempt from punishment for the damage part, not guilty of the theft part, and Shen and Ye were not guilty of the assault part. Shen's sister's insult part is still under appeal. However, Shen Yuankai recently hired a lawyer to accuse his wife Wu in the civil court of Wuxian District Court of adultery with Xu Jiuxiang, a former member of the Suzhou General Labor Union. He claimed that she was pregnant and unbearable abuse, and requested a divorce. When the court opened on March 26, Wu Cuqin happened to have her menstrual period. She even intended to pull out her sanitary napkin in court to show that she was not pregnant. The judge stopped her. The court then sent Wu to Zhihua Hospital for examination and found that she was not pregnant and had no signs of abortion. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday (30th), the judge of the Wuxian District Court summoned Shen Yuankai and Wu Cuqin for questioning again. Shen's concubine and sister also arrived in court to listen. Shen accused his wife of adultery and unbearable abuse and asked for a divorce. Wu Cuqin said to Shen, "If the judge hadn't stopped me at the previous court hearing, I would have stuffed my sanitary napkin into your mouth and let you taste it." She denied adultery and abuse. The plaintiff's lawyers Yao Xiaoqiu and Zhou Danian said that everyone knew that the defendant was having an affair, and she even tried to make the plaintiff taste her sanitary napkin in court, which shows how rude she is. The plaintiff really cannot live with her anymore and asked for a divorce. The defendant's lawyer Lu Xiangru said that the plaintiff's accusation of adultery and pregnancy had been proven unfounded after the examination, and there was no conclusive evidence of adultery. However, the plaintiff's unfounded accusation of adultery and pregnancy had caused great embarrassment to the defendant and did not meet the requirements for divorce under civil law. In summary, the case was caused by the plaintiff taking a concubine and should be rejected. The court then concluded the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 a.m. on April 3. Shen and Wu were ordered to return.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Founders for Waterworks Establishment</h3>
<p>Cheng Ganxiang, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Yipeng and others have launched the establishment of the Suzhou Waterworks and have held discussions to proceed. It is planned to raise a capital of one million yuan. In addition to the 750,000 yuan to be undertaken by the founders in Shanghai, the remaining amount will be undertaken by the people of Suzhou. In recent days, more than 30 people, including Xu Boming, Zhang Shoupeng, and Fan Junbo, have signed up to participate as founders. The first meeting of the founders will be convened in the coming days, and preparation offices will be set up in both Suzhou and Shanghai to facilitate the project.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Spring Silkworm Season Approaching</p>
<p>The spring silkworm season in this county will begin in mid-April. Due to the active silk sales last fall, the number of autumn silkworm egg sheets increased sharply to more than 85,000. This year, the number of spring silkworm egg sheets has increased even more sharply. As of the 29th, more than 185,000 spring silkworm egg sheets have been ordered. The silkworm egg sheets will be distributed in three phases: the first phase on April 10, the second phase on April 15, and the third phase on April 2. All scattered households will be distributed at any time starting from the 10th. The Jiangsu Provincial Improvement and Management Committee, in view of the improvement in silk sales last year and the insufficient number of silkworm egg sheets, feared that there would be a shortage of spring silkworm egg sheets this spring. Therefore, in January, it sent personnel to Japan to purchase more than 70,000 Japanese silkworm egg sheets, which were transported to Wuxi for storage. Currently, this county can be allocated 50,000 of these silkworm egg sheets. Last spring silkworm season, there were 102 cocoon brokerages and 1,500 drying stoves in the county. Based on the estimated number of spring silkworm egg sheets this year, the number of drying stoves should be increased by at least 1,000. The registration date for cocoon brokerages will begin on May 1. The instructors from the model area guidance stations will also depart in the coming days to start the guidance work.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Fire Accident Caused by Electrical Fault</p>
<p>On the 28th and 29th, Wangjiangjing Town in Jiaxing,</p>
<p>Because of the Liuwanghui festival, the town's businesses</p>
<p>Were very prosperous, and they all stocked up on goods a few days in advance, ready for employers to buy. Yi Shunxing South Grocery Store on Yili Street in the town caught fire at about 9:00 p.m. on the 28th due to an electrical fault in the light wires, which burned paper ingots and treasures. The fire quickly became fierce and unapproachable. More than 1,000 yuan in legal tender earned from recent business was burned, and all accounting books could not be retrieved in time. Although the fire brigade arrived and put out the fire, the loss was nearly 10,000 yuan. Shi Yousheng and Zhong Wenhuan, two neighbors, were burned while fighting the fire and are currently receiving treatment in the hospital.</p>

<h3>Guangdong-Guangxi Industry Inspection Group Returns to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Impressions Published: Guangdong and Guangxi Construction is Well-Scaled, but the Lack of Unified Currency and Exchange Creates Obstacles</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Industry Inspection Group, organized by the China General Chamber of Industry, completed its inspection in Guangdong and Guangxi. Except for Wang Zhisheng and 13 others who stayed in Hong Kong and Guangdong for sightseeing, the leader Cai Shengbai and 21 others arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:30 on the Jackson. They published very detailed inspection impressions. Industrial and commercial groups in this city have scheduled banquets to welcome the group. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Warm Welcome Yesterday morning, those who went to the Jianghai Customs Wharf and boarded the ship to welcome the group included Qian Chengxu and He Pengcheng of the China General Chamber of Industry, Gu Huaibing of the National Federation of Commerce, Gu Xiguang of the Machinery Industry Association, Sun Choucheng of the National Goods Factory Federation, Liu Zhongying of the China National Manufacturers Federation, Xu Jianruo, Sun Daosheng, and Huang Mengtu of the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, Xu Yunhui and Zu Wangfu of the National Goods Movement Federation, Zhang Yichen and Chen Jiufeng of the First Special District Citizens Association, and representatives of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and Yapu Ear Electrical Factory, as well as relatives and friends of the group members, totaling more than 100 people. Two welcome flags were made, with the words "Welcome the Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Group Back to Shanghai" written on them, placed on the Jianghai Customs Wharf and the passenger ferry, which was very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation The President Jackson arrived at the port at 5:00 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Dalae Wharf in Bailianjing, Pudong, at 7:00 a.m. Industrial and commercial groups and relatives and friends of the group members took the Dalae Company's passenger ferry from the Jianghai Customs at 7:00 a.m. to Pudong to board the ship for welcome. Although the group members were travel-worn, they were full of energy. After greeting the welcomers, they took the ferry and arrived at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at 8:30 a.m. and disembarked. After taking a group photo, they took cars back to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>Returning Group Members There were a total of 34 group members in the Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Group. Those who returned to Shanghai this morning included the leader and deputy leader Cai Shengbai and Hu Xijian, as well as group members Fang Jiange, Yao Defu, Yuan Zhenxiang, Cheng Shouchong, Wang Zhenfang, Wu Qingtai, Pa Ying, Yu Bingshou, Zhao Shouchong, Wu Shuchen, Liu Junlin, Gu Runshen, Chai Zhixiang, Pan Yangyao, Sheng Yaqing, Shi Gengyin, Zhou Xianggeng, Xu Liunan, and Zhang Huikang, totaling 21 people. Wang Zhisheng, Guo Shun, Xiang Kangyuan, Qin Jingcheng, Fang Yexian, Chen Yuqing, Ren Shigang, Wang Youcai, Chen Yuquan, Pan Youcheng, Li Zufan, and 13 others are still staying in Hong Kong and Guangdong for sightseeing and private affairs and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the next ship.</p>

<p>Inspection Impressions All the members of the group jointly made the following remarks on their findings: "This group went to Guangdong and Guangxi to inspect industry. We first went to Guangzhou and received a warm welcome from the military and political authorities. We were guided to visit factories and various constructions, all of which were well-scaled. Various plans have also been carried out in order, such as the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the Provincial Property Management Office, the Survey and Statistics Bureau, and the Silk Improvement Bureau, all of which are deemed necessary. In particular, the six newly built sugar factories are the foundation for the revival of the province's sugar industry. This industry is as important as improving rice and improving silk. It is hoped that it will gradually expand, add sugarcane planting areas, and reduce sugar production costs in order to compete with foreign goods. Guangdong Province's heavy industry and chemical industry are related to national defense. Although they are in the early stages, they have a basic foundation. However, when establishing factories, we must consider local conditions and materials and distinguish between urgency. In particular, it is more difficult to run state-owned or provincial enterprises. We should give strong support and assistance to the industries run by the industrial and commercial sectors to enable them to develop. For industries that are already available in the private sector or that have large-scale production in other provinces, it is better to set up other types of factories first to avoid duplication. The distribution of industry and the construction of factories should first determine the location and divide the production areas. We should think about the entire nation. This requires long-term planning and proper regulations. Then we went to Guangxi Province. In places such as Wuzhou, Yulin, Guixian, Nanning, Liuzhou, and Guilin, we received a warm welcome. We deeply felt that Guangxi Province has been working hard on the three-selfs and three-residences policies in recent years and has been able to overcome the environment and gradually find solutions. We have been greatly encouraged in spirit. Guangxi Province is extremely rich in business, such as livestock, tung oil, rice, leather, firewood, charcoal, and minerals. Heaven is not unkind. In the future, if we pay full attention to transportation and develop local advantages, the accumulation of resources will be endless, and the production on the ground will be inexhaustible. Although local industry is currently scarce, it is very important to use local materials. If we can work hard to make progress, it will not be difficult to transform the province from an import province to an export province. For example, many of the raw materials needed by factories in Shanghai can be obtained from Guangxi Province, and the clothing, food, housing, and transportation needs of Guangxi Province can be supplied by our Shanghai factories. With division of labor and cooperation, the prosperity of Shanghai-Guangxi trade can be expected. In short, the construction of Guangdong Province and the spirit of Guangxi Province are both worthy of our admiration. However, the biggest obstacles to industry and commerce are the lack of unified currency and exchange and the lack of simple donations and taxes, which cause various difficulties in trade. The people in this trip have repeatedly mentioned that the highest local authorities need to plan and resolve these issues as soon as possible so that trade in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Guangxi will be convenient, and the foreign trade of all provinces can achieve a superior position. This is what the people in this trip hope for.</p>
<p>Group Banquets The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association will hold a banquet at Zhengyi Society on Nanjing Road at 6:00 p.m. on April 2 to welcome all members of the Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Group. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the National Federation of Commerce, the China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Machinery Industry Association, the National Goods Factory Federation, and the National Goods Movement Federation have all scheduled separate banquets to welcome all members of the group and request a report on the inspection.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Association Individual Group Election: Elected Representatives Announced</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and 25 Others Elected: Late Ballots Invalid, Groups Must Be Approved for Filing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association opened the ballots for the individual group election on the 28th. Questions arose about late ballots. After asking the Party and government agencies for instructions, a decree has now been received that they are legally invalid. The list of elected candidates was officially announced yesterday. The election qualifications for the group group have also been approved by the Municipal Party Department. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Late Ballots Are Legally Invalid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association and the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, because some of the ballots were received after 5:00 p.m. on the 27th and before 9:00 a.m. on the 28th during the opening of the ballots for the taxpayers association's individual member group election, had not been received within the statutory time. They sealed the ballots and presented them to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions on how to handle them. They also temporarily suspended the announcement of the results of the ballot opening and the list of elected candidates on that day. It is now learned that the association received instructions from the Municipal Party Department yesterday. The original text said: "A case is presented for the public concession's Chinese taxpayers association's citizens group (ie, individual group) voting beyond the time limit. Please approve. Upon receipt of the presentation, it is found that the election vote has exceeded the prescribed time and should be invalid according to law. Please inform.

<p>Regulations on Group Election Qualifications</p>
<p>The same hometown associations, such as this city, arbitrarily strengthen the qualifications of candidates for the group group of the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, obstructing the movement, and specially presented a request to the Municipal Party Department for instructions to stop this in order to promote the movement and comply with the law. It is now learned that the association received approval number 4050 from the Municipal Party Department yesterday. The original text said, "A case is presented for the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association arbitrarily strengthening the qualifications of candidates for the group group, obstructing the movement, and attaching the original letter from the Taxpayers Association. Please review and approve. Upon receipt of the presentation, it is found that the legality of each group should be determined by whether it has been submitted to the association for filing and approval. All groups that have been formally filed and have received a license certificate issued by the association have the qualifications of candidates and shall not prevent the participation of their representatives in the election. In addition to ordering the concession taxpayers association to comply, please inform."</p>
<h3>Foreign Board Election Errors: The Bureau Begins a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau, for the previous foreign board election, had an error of omitting 323 ballots. It had previously decided to send personnel for a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. It is now heard that the bureau has appointed the current directors, Kanai (American), Kellerley (British), and Yamamoto Takeo (Japanese), to form an investigation committee to investigate the truth of the error. It is also heard that the above three have begun their work since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Isogu and Wakasugi's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Major General Isogu, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy in China, has been transferred and promoted to Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army. Therefore, he left Shanghai on the Japanese ship Hakusan Maru at 9:00 p.m. last night to return to his country and take office. Japanese military officers stationed in Shanghai all went to Shanghai to see him off. As for the new military attache Kiki Tada Makoto, he will come to China after Isogu returns to his country.</p>
<p>Wakusugi Kaname, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in China, arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 p.m. yesterday from Qingdao on the Qingdao Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company. Many people from the Japanese Consulate General in this port went to the port to welcome him. After disembarking, Wakasugi went to his residence to rest. He is scheduled to enter Beijing in the coming days to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang and inform him of the temporary charge of embassy affairs. Wakasugi has now been ordered to be transferred to the position of Consul General in Shanghai and will be stationed in Beijing and Shanghai in the future to handle affairs. As for the date of the return of the former Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Ishi, has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Inspects All City Police Officers Yesterday</h3>
<p>The officers and police were in high spirits with orderly steps. Mayor Wu and Director Cai gave speeches respectively.</p>
<p>The first training team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau completed their training period. Yesterday morning, they gathered at the public sports field for inspection by Mayor Wu himself. More than a thousand officers and police were present. At 9:00 AM, Deputy Inspector General and full-time member of the Officer and Police Training Implementation Committee, Dong Guangfu, conducted a preliminary inspection. At 11:00 AM, Mayor Wu, along with Bureau Director Cai Jingjun, Inspector General Wang Dasui, and Director of the Military Training Committee Li Xiangqi, arrived at the field amidst cheerful military music. Over a hundred officials above the rank of section chief, division chief, and director from the Bureau were present, lined up on the right side of the reviewing stand. All officers and police being inspected were under the command of Wu Xiong, the division chief of the city center. After Mayor Wu arrived at the field, he rested briefly at the reviewing stand before commencing the inspection. Director Cai, Military Training Director Li, and Deputy Inspectors General Wang and Dong served as inspecting officers. After the inspection, the inspecting officers accompanied Mayor Wu back to the command stand to review the entire march-past. The officers and police marched in orderly steps and were full of spirit. Mayor Wu deeply praised them. After the march-past, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that the police are officials close to the people and should approach the people in all matters, lead the people, practice the New Life Movement, promote propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, hoping to revive the Chinese nation and lead the country to prosperity. Mayor Wu elaborated on the significance of the New Life Movement, gathering extensively from various sources. Director Cai then gave a speech, briefly stating that to be a good policeman, one must be responsible, disciplined, eliminate corruption, and love the people.

<h3>The Eurasia Shaanxi-Kunming Airline Will Officially Commence Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Xi'an is the starting point, Kunming is the destination. The entire route is 1,300 kilometers long. This morning, Aircraft No. 17 will fly to Chengdu.</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's planned Beijing-Yunnan route has now been renamed the Shaanxi-Kunming route. Civilian Aircraft No. 17 is scheduled to depart from Shanghai this morning, stop in Chengdu overnight, and officially commence operations tomorrow morning. Our reporter has learned the following details:</p>
<h3>Beijing-Yunnan Route Renamed Shaanxi-Kunming Route</h3>
<p>In order to expand its routes and develop its business, the company submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to establish a direct Beijing-Kunming route. After a trial flight on February 25th, the results were exceptionally good. Personnel were immediately dispatched to build radio stations along the route, which have now been completed. The Beijing-Yunnan route has been renamed the Shaanxi-Kunming route, with Xi'an, Shaanxi as the starting point and Kunming, Yunnan as the destination, passing through Chengdu. However, it is fully connected with the Shanghai-Chengdu route of Shanghai-Nanjing-Zhengzhou-Xi'an-Chengdu.</p>
<h3>Officially Opening Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The Shaanxi-Kunming route is ready. The entire route from Chengdu to Kunming is 1,300 kilometers long. The company has decided, based on the preparation report, to dispatch the giant Junkers passenger Aircraft No. 17 from Shanghai Longhua Airport at 6:30 AM today, passing through Nanjing, and arriving in Chengdu at 3:00 PM this afternoon, where it will stay overnight. The official maiden voyage of the Shaanxi-Kunming route, via Chengdu to Kunming, is scheduled for tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang Inspects the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inspection can be scientific, and work can be orderly.</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang came to Shanghai this time, and considering the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau and the International Trade Bureau as important affiliated agencies, he went to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau at 1040 North Suzhou Road at around 3:00 PM yesterday for several hours of inspection. Director Cai Wuji and the heads of various groups of the Bureau accompanied the inspection of the three inspection groups of raw silk, agricultural crops, and plant diseases and insect pests. Due to time constraints, the two groups of chemical industrial products in animal products could not be fully viewed. At 5:30, he and all the staff of the two bureaus took photos on the fourth floor roof of the bureau, and Minister Wu delivered a speech, briefly stating that this was his second visit to Shanghai after taking office in Beijing. The last time was on New Year's Day, and the bureaus were closed. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he planned to inspect the Commodity Inspection Bureau and the International Trade Bureau separately, but due to time constraints, he only inspected three groups of the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The remaining parts and the International Trade Bureau will have to wait until the next visit to Shanghai for further inspection. He said that the impression gained from today's inspection is that the inspection can be scientific and the work can be orderly. He also said that commodity inspection and international trade are very important. Domestic commodity improvement is essential for the development of international trade. Therefore, the development of the International Trade Bureau's business depends on the development of the Commodity Inspection Bureau as its foundation. Nowadays, the government and society are paying more and more attention to and understanding commodity inspection, and the responsibility of the colleagues of the Commodity Inspection Bureau is also becoming more and more important. He deeply hopes that you will work harder to seek progress so that you will not fail the expectations of the country and society. At the end, Director Cai gave a speech to encourage the colleagues of the Bureau to work harder in the future to live up to the expectations of the Ministry.</p>
<h3>The Grain Committee Decides to Order 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>There are currently more than 626,000 bags of rice in Shanghai. Request the Municipal Government to build a new rice warehouse on the Duojialu base.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Committee held a regular meeting at Cuixiu Hall in Ba Miao the other day. The members present were Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Jiang Shizhi, Cai Yukun, Yu Zixiang, Wu Huanru, Zhang Binghui, Sun Yongyi, and Zhou Wugang, chaired by Zhang Binghui, and recorded by Zhou Minggang. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Since the 43rd regular meeting, there have been no major incidents, and the price of grain has been very low in recent years, which is naturally desirable from the consumer's point of view. Therefore, the meeting has been suspended for more than a year. Now, the original accumulated grain property of Shanghai County, part of the Duojialu base, was originally leased by the Shanghai Municipal Hospital. Now the hospital plans to rebuild the houses, hoping to occupy them permanently, which not only affects property rights but also greatly hinders the accumulated grain plan. How to properly deal with this is the most important issue of today's meeting. Also, there have been many changes in the members of the committee, and how to supplement them to restore the committee's work. Secondly, regarding the recent rise in grain prices, especially the sharp rise in flour prices, whether there will be a grain problem in Shanghai during the lean season this year, the committee members should contribute as much as possible based on their experience and what they have seen and heard, and make proper preparations to avoid accidents. As for the accumulated grain warehouse construction plan, it is especially important to work together to achieve the goal and make thorough preparations for the city's grain problem. The committee bears a major mission for the adjustment and maintenance of grain in the city, and the committee members should express their opinions and work together to promote progress.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gu's Report</h3>
<p>Next, Committee Member Gu Xinyi reported that the rice harvest last year was good. It is estimated that there will be no panic about grain this year. However, due to currency reform and the accumulation of grain in various places, grain prices have risen slightly. As for ordering foreign rice, due to price discrepancies, it is rare to order it. Only Siamese broken rice is suitable for grain use. Recently, about 200,000 shi have been ordered. There are currently about 670,000 shi of rice in Shanghai, and rice arrives from the river every day, so there is no shortage of grain for the time being. However, it is difficult to predict the lean season in May and June.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhu's Report</h3>
<p>Next, Committee Member Zhu Zixiang reported that he had three suggestions at the beginning of the committee: 1. Build a rice industry wharf; 2. Build a warehouse; 3. Accumulate grain. The first item has been completed with the help of the Social Affairs Bureau and various parties. For the second item, there is only a warehouse built by the rice industry, which has limited capacity and can store less rice. The government warehouse has not yet been established. As for the third item, it is urgent but has not been implemented, which is regrettable. The Social Affairs Bureau should be requested to submit a report to the Municipal Government to build a new-style rice warehouse on the base of the accumulated grain property and raise funds to accumulate grain to lay the foundation for the people's food.</p>
<h3>Rice Inventory</h3>
<p>The recent survey of the amount of rice stored in various rice stores in the city is listed below (however, this amount of rice is fluid and changes frequently): Lao Ningshao Store 47,000 bags, Hong'an Store 7,000 bags, Daxing Store 1,800 bags, Xin Ning Store 21,000 bags, Hezong Store 4,000 bags, Xin Yu Store 1,800 bags, Huatong Store 5,000 bags, Hongsheng Store 300 bags, Company Store 6,000 bags, Nan Osaka Store 11,000 bags, Doumi Industry Store 45,000 bags, Mitsubishi Store 19,100 bags, Shuntai Store 35,200 bags, Yitaixing Store 15,600 bags, China Merchants Hua Store 26,600 bags, Qichang Store 5,100 bags, Taikoo Store 17,800 bags, Jinliyuan Store 15,000 bags, China Store 64,000 bags, Industry Store 25,500 bags, Mainland Store 27,000 bags, Xingye Store 17,000 bags, Yukang Store 30,000 bags, Shanghai Store 7,000 bags, rice factories 85,000 bags, totaling 626,200 bags, about 150,000 bags of粳rice.</p>
<h3>Important Resolutions</h3>
<p>The government members of the committee have been changed frequently. It is proposed to request the Social Affairs Bureau to send a letter to the relevant bureaus to select staff to replace them to restore the committee's work. Also, many expert members have left Shanghai. Please ask the Social Affairs Bureau to find suitable candidates to fill the vacancies. (Proposed by Zhang Binghui) Resolved, passed as proposed, and requested the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it. For the expert member candidates, it is proposed to invite Mr. Feng Liutang to serve. There is one more position. Please have the Social Affairs Bureau select someone. The original accumulated grain property of Shanghai County has not been clearly divided, and the base leased by the Shanghai Municipal Hospital, the hospital plans to rebuild it, hoping to occupy it permanently, which not only concerns property rights but also greatly hinders the accumulated grain plan. How to properly deal with it, please resolve. (Proposed by Zhang Binghui) Resolved, a report will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau and forwarded to the Municipal Government to argue the case, stating that according to the central government's order to accumulate grain property, it must not be used for other purposes, and request the Municipal Government to allocate funds to build a new-style rice warehouse on the Duojialu base, which belongs to the original accumulated grain property, as soon as possible to carry out the accumulated grain business. The grain problem in the city is very important. How to plan for a sufficient plan, and how to actively carry out the warehouse construction and grain accumulation, please discuss. (Proposed by Zhang Binghui) Committee Member Gu Xinyi stated that the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that the city is short of about 300,000 shi of rice this year, has borrowed 3 million yuan from the Agricultural Bank of China to order 300,000 yuan of foreign rice and requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to issue free passports. The city has a large population and a shortage of grain, which is inevitable, and more active planning should be made to prevent emergencies. Resolved, a report will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau and forwarded to the Municipal Government to allocate 200,000 yuan to order 100,000 bags of foreign rice. The shortage of funds will be used for collateral when the rice arrives. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance will be requested to issue tax-free passports and plan to build a new-style rice warehouse on the Duojialu base as soon as possible for storing grain.</p>

<h3>Wang Shulou, a Major Offender in the Post Office Robbery Case, Was Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>In the major robbery and bloodshed case that occurred at the North Sichuan Road Post Office Administration on September 9th last year, the offender Jiangbei monk Ji Rentang (Dharma name: Wukong) and accomplices Liang Kehe, Qiu Guobin, and six other men and women were arrested by the police and sent to the First Special District Court. Ji Rentang was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the others were punished according to law. The Wukong monk had the notorious thief Wang Shulou (also known as Shupei Chen Yuren, 33 years old) from Funing, who received 12,000 yuan of stolen money. His concubine A Xiang escaped to Nanchang, Jiangxi, and remained at large. Recently, she suddenly returned to Shanghai and hid at 7 Zhifu Road. At 1:00 PM on the 17th of this month, Hu Lin Road Police Detective Wang Yufu discovered this, secretly went to the address with Western detectives, and arrested Wang the thief without making a sound, along with a box containing 25 pieces of clothing. However, most of the stolen money was taken away by his concubine A Xiang, and the remaining 3,000 yuan had been spent. He was sent to the Third Criminal Court. It was found that he had previously committed theft and served a prison sentence. After interrogation, he confessed. He was ordered to be returned to prison to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned him about his name, origin, and age. After questioning, and inquiring whether the clothes in the box were bought with stolen money, Wang the thief admitted that they were. Judge Wang Shulou was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly committing robbery with intentional homicide and recidivism. The seized clothes were returned to the victim.</p>
<h3>A Solar Eclipse in Mid-June This Year</h3>
<p>China Will Send Personnel to Observe in Russia</p>
<p>The Chinese Solar Eclipse Observation Committee was formed last year by nine academic institutions, including the Astronomy, Physics, and Meteorology Institutes affiliated to the Academia Sinica, the Peiping Research Institute, Tsinghua University, the Sun Yat-sen University Observatory, the Qingdao Observatory, the Chinese Astronomical Society, and the Chinese Physical Society. Its purpose is to prepare for the observation of the total solar eclipse visible in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins of China on September 21, 1941. The committee reviewed and decided on April 17th to send an observation team to Russia to observe the total solar eclipse on June 19th of this year.</p>
<h3>Russian Police Kicked a Chinese to Death, the Court Has Filed a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Sheng Yi ship loaded cargo in Tianjin and returned to Shanghai. In the evening, the Russian guard of the ship, Ke Xin (transliteration), kicked a coolie, A Fu, to death. The local court sent personnel to verify that he had been kicked in the abdomen and died. Ke Xin was arrested and detained pending investigation. This has been reported earlier. It is now known that the case has been clearly investigated by Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, who filed a public prosecution for causing death by injury. It will be tried publicly in the near future.</p>
<h3>A Mother's Deep Love for Her Son</h3>
<p>The Complaint of Disobedience Was Withdrawn</p>
<p>Tang Zhou, a Chaozhou woman, the main woman of Li Shi Pawnshop at 271 Kaifeng Road, because her son Tang Zhou Li did not engage in proper business but specialized in prostitution and gambling, when she tried to persuaded him, she was brutally beaten. Recently, she was beaten and injured, so she sued him in the First Special District Court for the crime of injuring a direct ascendant relative. After the First Special Court summoned and tried the case, it ordered that he be detained and rescheduled for trial. Yesterday, Director Feng Shide continued the trial. Tang Zhou stated that if the defendant could turn over a new leaf, she would withdraw the lawsuit. The court stated that the legal articles she was charging were articles 280 and 281 of the Criminal Law, but article 280 was not a crime that could be prosecuted without a complaint. The court could not withdraw the case. If she applied to change the articles and only prosecuted under article 281, then she could withdraw the case. The woman immediately stated that she was willing to change the articles. Director Feng then asked Tang Zhouli whether he could change his ways. He answered that he would definitely turn over a new leaf. Furthermore, as the saying goes, "There are no wrong parents in the world," the court advised the plaintiff that everything could be given a little more room, and there was no need to be so angry. Director Feng approved the confession, saying that because there are no wrong parents in the world, children should properly advise their parents even if their parents are too angry and must not beat them. He should be severely punished, but in order to maintain the peace of his family and give him a chance to reform, the court would allow his mother to withdraw the case. He should treat her well in the future. Tang agreed. The court then announced that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Fire in Kongjia Lane: Two Girls Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:23 AM, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 2 Hengxing Lane, Kongjia Lane North, Nanshi, spreading to Nos. 2 and 4, resulting in significant losses. Reporters rushed to the scene to investigate. It was learned that the second landlord of No. 3, surnamed Tang, named Genquan, and his concubine, Tang Banshu, jointly leased the one-story building at No. 3 Hengxing Lane. They lived upstairs, while the downstairs was rented to the Feng brothers, Guisheng and Qiusheng, who ran a foreign jade workshop. On this day, Tang Genquan was sound asleep when he suddenly heard a fire upstairs. He quickly reported it to the police. The West District Fire Brigade dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the blaze. It was not until 11:30 AM that the fire was put out. When the fire broke out, the Feng brothers were out, and only four or five apprentices were at home. Upon seeing the fire, they scattered and fled, forgetting to carry out Feng Qiusheng's young daughter (who was only two months old), who was burned to death. After the fire started, the foreign jade easily caught fire, causing it to spread to Nos. 2 and 4. The second landlord of No. 2, Qiu Shouyu, from Nanjing, did not live in the house. He ran a tiger stove nearby. When he heard of the fire and rushed over, it was already a scorched ruin. Later, the building was rented to Da Huixiang, also from Nanjing, who worked at the Penglai Market. His wife went out shopping, leaving a newborn baby, just over a month old, and a four-year-old boy at home. After the fire started, only the boy ran out, and the baby was also burned to death. Only the Zhang family lived at No. 4, running Zhang Quanjih Factory, which produced various books and publications. They were also affected by the fire. As a result, No. 3 was completely burned down. The pavilion of No. 2 was spared, and the ground floor of No. 4 was not affected. After the fire was extinguished, the Laobeimen Police Station of the Ximen Branch of the Public Security Bureau took Tang Genquan, the second landlord of No. 3, to the station for questioning, demanding that he identify the cause of the fire before allowing him to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Yi Baozhu Sues Yi Fangshuo Case</h3>
<p>Judgment to be Pronounced Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a person with mental [issues], is being sued by his cousin Yi Baozhu in the First Special District Court for damages. The reason is that the plaintiff suffered adultery by the defendant, causing great harm to her body and reputation. Therefore, she requests compensation for damages of $5,500. This case has been heard several times by the First Special Court, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi held another hearing. According to Yi Baozhu's lawyer, the plaintiff has now reached the legal age and can therefore independently handle the lawsuit without a legal representative. He then stated the reasons for the lawsuit. Yi Baozhu testified that she was 21 years old, born on February 5th. On November 14th, when she was 17 years old, she was lured by the defendant to a hotel across from the Empire Theater and raped, a total of four or five times. Later, at the age of 19, the defendant attempted to continue the rape but failed and beat her severely all night. The defendant Yi Fangshuo did not appear, but his lawyer was present. Regarding the facts of adultery, the plaintiff must provide evidence. After Judge Huang verified the testimony, he announced the end of the debate in the case and set the judgment to be pronounced at 2:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Fang Jinwen and Wife Suddenly Assassinated Last Night</h3>
<p>Wife Dead, Husband Critically Injured</p>
<p>Fang Jinwen, 35 years old, from Shaoxing, lived in the back building of No. 28 Hantai Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, with his wife Peng, 26 years old, from Liyang. They had moved there only recently, about ten days ago. Unexpectedly, last night around 11:00 PM, Fang Jinwen and Peng were suddenly assassinated. Fang Jinwen's hands were slashed four times, and he was shot in the abdomen. Peng had knife wounds all over her body. At that time, the police officer at post No. 10 on Yongxing Road was on duty when he suddenly heard a police whistle coming from the house. He rushed to investigate and found them. He immediately returned to the police station to report the incident and hired a car to take the couple to the hospital for treatment. However, Peng died en route due to severe injuries, and Fang Jinwen was also in critical condition. After receiving treatment at the hospital, he regained some consciousness. When the police officer asked him about the cause of the attack and the identity of the assailant, he said that the assailant was a member of a certain organization he knew, number 2371. He then fainted again. The police station then instructed to summon the second landlord of the house for questioning. According to the second landlord, they were already asleep at the time. In a daze, they suddenly heard two gunshots in the back building, and what sounded like the mixed footsteps of three or four people. After the gunshots, they heard Peng calling for help, which then went silent. After a while, they heard the police whistle, and they started to see it, and the police also arrived. However, during the day, a person wearing a yellow uniform came to Fang Jinwen's house to talk and then left. It is said that Fang Jinwen and Peng were cohabiting, so the case may be a love triangle murder. At present, in addition to reporting to the headquarters, the police station is strictly investigating the whereabouts of the murderer.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Yangtze River Vessels to Implement New System on April 1st</h3>
<p>All Vessels to Comply from Tomorrow</p>
<p>Maximum of Thirty Business Personnel on Each Yangtze River Vessel</p>
<p>New Ticket Sales Regulations Also Announced</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to implement a new system to reform its Yangtze River vessels starting tomorrow, April 1st. The implementation date has arrived, and the measures decided upon through consultation with the Ministry of Communications were announced yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New System for Each Vessel</p>
<p>The company's Yangtze River vessels are divided into three classes: large, medium, and small. Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiangxin, etc., are large vessels; Jianguo, Jiangda, Jiangjing, Jiangyu, Jiangtian, etc., are medium vessels; and Kuaili, which travels the upper Yangtze, is a small vessel. Previously, Yangtze River vessels operated under a contracted system, with passenger fares being contracted by the business director each time. The company's profits and losses were not taken into account. During Liu Hongsheng's time, the contracted system was abolished. Therefore, the Jiangjing vessel has already been changed to a purser, directly under the company's management. Now, it is decided that on April 1st, all Yangtze River vessels will uniformly adopt the new system. The business directors of each vessel will be abolished by today, and pursers will be appointed instead. The system for each vessel has also been decided upon by the Ministry of Communications and the company. It is publicly announced that each vessel will have one purser, one accountant, four ticket inspectors, three general affairs staff, one clerk, one cargo director, one assistant director, ten cargo clerks, and eight watchmen. No additional personnel may be added beyond this quota.</p>
<p>Salaries and Benefits</p>
<p>All personnel on the vessels, from the purser downwards, will be appointed by the company and will be paid a salary. However, salaries will vary depending on the size of the vessel. After consultation between the Ministry of Communications and the company, the salary rates for each position on the vessels are as follows: Class A vessels (i.e., Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiangxin) purser monthly salary of $250, plus $100 for public expenses; Class B vessels (i.e., Jiangda, Jianguo, etc.) purser monthly salary of $200, plus $100 for public expenses. Accountant monthly salary of $60, ticket inspector $28, clerk $24, cargo director $80, assistant director $40, cargo clerk $24, watchman $16.</p>
<p>Appointed Personnel</p>
<p>This new system must be implemented tomorrow. Therefore, in order to ensure a smooth transition, the company has already appointed Zhang Yanling as the purser of the Jianghua vessel, Jin Tingxun for the Jiangshun vessel, Zhuo Da'wu for the Jiang'an vessel, Liu Jida for the Jiangxin vessel, Zhang Zhongyu for the Jiangda vessel, Shen Yougeng for the Jianguo vessel, and Shen Huating for the Kuaili vessel. The appointment letters were sent out yesterday. In order to ensure the implementation of the new system starting on April 1st, Cai Zengji has issued another instruction stating that even if a vessel is en route, the new organization must be implemented during the voyage. Personnel in excess of the quota must disembark at the nearest port along the way and are not allowed to delay for even one day. The implementation date has been telegraphed to all vessels en route for unified compliance.</p>
<p>Regular Stewards</p>
<p>The practice of Yangtze River vessel stewards being hired by the business director has now been completely abolished. The stewards on each vessel will be renamed service staff, and their numbers will be greatly reduced. The number of stewards on Class A vessels, originally at least 130 to 150, is now limited to no more than 80. Class B vessels, originally with 100 to 120, are now limited to no more than 70. Class C vessels are limited to no more than 60. Service staff will also be paid a salary, set at $12 per month. The head steward will be paid a monthly salary of $16. As for tips, etc., separate regulations will be formulated, and extortion will not be allowed.</p>
<p>No Ticket Sales on Vessels</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, no tickets will be sold on any Yangtze River vessels, including third-class, fourth-class, and steerage. They will all be sold by the company. Ticket offices will be built at the Jinliyuan Wharf to facilitate passengers to purchase tickets for boarding at any time. Beds will be assigned inside the vessel according to the tickets, and no one may board without a ticket. Ticket offices with wooden railings will also be set up at all ports along the Yangtze River, on the wharves or on the vessels. It is stipulated that all must be completed by the 26th of this month. Starting on April 1st, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, and all small ports will implement this system. Military police will be responsible for maintaining order inside the vessels and at the wharves.</p>
<p>New Ticket Sales Regulations</p>
<p>Except for special class tickets, all cabin tickets will temporarily use a three-part form. Two parts will be given to the passenger for safekeeping, and one part will be retained as a stub. All will be printed by the head office. Due to time constraints, the original tickets will be used temporarily. The items that should be filled out on the passenger tickets must not be neglected or omitted. For the time being, they may be filled out with ink pens. After each item is filled out on the passenger ticket, the official seal prescribed by the head office, each branch office, or the ticket office should be affixed to the seam and the ticket seller's area, and it will only be valid after being signed by the person in charge. When selling passenger tickets, the ticket seller should indicate the cabin number and berth number, as well as the words "upper berth" or "lower berth," on the upper end of the ticket. Half an hour before the ship departs, the head office or each branch office should fill out a passenger cabin berth report based on the number of passengers in each cabin, and deliver it to the ship for verification and retention. After the ship departs, the remaining rooms and berths, their numbers, and the departure time should be telegraphed to neighboring ports as soon as possible, so that tickets and cabins can be booked according to the quota. After the head office or each branch office learns of the ship schedule and the remaining cabins and berths, it should start selling tickets and booking cabins, and stop selling passenger tickets half an hour before the ship arrives at the port. First, second, and third class passenger tickets will not be sold as round-trip tickets. Each ticket is for one passenger. Children over four years old may purchase half-price tickets, and those over twelve years old must purchase full-price tickets. In the event of a discount or free fare, you must absolutely comply with the company's regulations when boarding, and the passenger ticket should be filled in based on the certificate, and the words "free" or "discount" should be clearly noted on the ticket. This certificate should be reported to the head office's business section and forwarded to the accounting office for verification and retention along with the sold passenger tickets. If it is found to be inconsistent with the rules, the person in charge will still be required to pay the original price. The inn or ticket office tickets issued by the hotel or ticket office where the head and branch offices are located must first be exchanged for the company's passenger tickets at the branch office before they are valid. The head and branch offices are responsible for collecting the ticket money separately. The stubs of each inn and ticket office ticket exchanged by the head and branch offices should be taken along with the sold passenger ticket report and sent to the business section of the head office for verification and forwarding to the accounting office for retention. As soon as the ticket stubs of each passenger ticket are sold out, they should be sent to the business section of the head office for verification and forwarding to the accounting office for record. The passenger tickets sold each day should be filled in on the sold passenger ticket report, copied in triplicate, one for the stub, two sent to the business section of the head office with the ship, and three sent to the accounting office of the head office with the notice when reporting for payment.</p>

<p>In Fengjia Village, southwest of Wusong, about seven or eight miles away, there is an old woman, Feng Fengshi, in her sixties, who farms for a living. Her eldest son, A Xiang, and second son, Mao Hu, both make a living in Shanghai. The family is well-off, and Mao Hu recently married a bride in the middle of last month. The bride's dowry was very large, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. At about 2:00 AM the night before last, 15 bandits suddenly broke into the house, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, and carrying knives, clubs, and other weapons, threatening the occupants to remain silent. They then entered the room of the old woman's eldest daughter-in-law, Gu, and searched and robbed two large packages of satin and leather clothing. While the bandits were searching and robbing, someone, the old woman's husband's brother (who lived in the west house), learned of the robbery, sneaked out the back door, crawled to the nearby villages along the embankment, and called for help. The villagers responded and came out. When the bandits learned of this, they did not have time to rob the rooms of the new bride, Yang, and the old woman. So, with a shout, they hurriedly fled. Because the villagers did not have defensive firearms, they did not dare to pursue them. Afterwards, when they checked the items, only the satin and leather clothing and a small amount of gold jewelry in Gu's room were robbed, totaling a loss of about 300 yuan.</p>

<p>Wife Catches Husband in the Act</p>
<p>Ji Shengfa, a resident of a flat in Yaojiaqiao Road No. 7, Zhabei, from Funing, 37 years old, runs a Shengji domino workshop, and the business is doing well. Ji married Lin, 28 years old. After their marriage, the couple had a very good relationship. Last year, they had a daughter named Lingzi. Because of postpartum illness, Ms. Lin lacked milk, so she hired a Yangzhou woman, Zhu Wu, 29 years old, as a wet nurse through a relative's introduction. She started working at Ji's house in November of last year, and everything was peaceful. Unexpectedly, Shengfa was fond of women and thought of adultery. Seeing that Zhu Wu was somewhat attractive, he had thoughts of lust. He flirted with her on weekdays, and Zhu Wu did not refuse. Now, with the beginning of this year's old calendar, Ji and Wu became good, and from then on, they had a clandestine affair, which was not just once. Recently, the secret affair was revealed and learned by Lin. In a fit of jealousy, she pretended to go out shopping yesterday afternoon, hiding in a neighbor's house. Seeing that the opportunity was rare, Shengfa secretly met with Wu. After a while, Ms. Lin suddenly sneaked in. The sound of mutual scolding reached outside. After the police officer heard about it, he rushed over and inquired about the details. Because the case involved adultery and disrupting public morals, Ji, Lin, and Zhu Wu were taken to the police station. According to Ji Lin's confession, she accused her husband of having an affair with the wet nurse, Zhu Wu, and requested an investigation. When questioned, Ji Shengfa and Zhu Wu were evasive and denied having any adulterous acts, only admitting that they occasionally made jokes and teased each other. According to the confession, the police station determined that the case involved disrupting public morals and violating criminal law, and prepared a document and sent it to the headquarters for investigation.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau: The Question of the Band's Survival</h3>
<p>This year's band budget is only sufficient for the first five months; if it is to continue, taxpayers should be responsible for raising funds.</p>
<p>As a customary practice, the annual meeting for Chinese and foreign taxpayers is held every spring in April to elect board members. The question of whether the Public Works Bureau's band should be retained or abolished has been discussed for years and has long been a matter of concern to both Chinese and foreign individuals. A detailed account of the band's past history, the process of discussions regarding its existence or abolition, and its current status is provided below for those who are interested in researching this matter.</p>
<p>Originally, the municipal band was reorganized and expanded from a folk music band. The municipal band was privately run, but due to insufficient funds, a request was made for the Public Works Bureau to take over its management, thus turning it into a public entity. This occurred in 1881, based on a resolution made at the taxpayers' annual meeting. Since then, the disposition of the band has been entirely subject to the wishes of the taxpayers. In 1923 and 1927, when the taxpayers held their annual meetings, there were proposals to amend the budget in order to abolish the band. However, these proposals were rejected. In 1934, the majority of the Public Works Bureau's board of directors, feeling the urgency of the current economic crisis, decided to present the issue of the band's funding at the taxpayers' annual meeting, and the chairman suggested actively preparing for the band's abolition within the year. However, this proposal still failed to pass. Last year, some taxpayers again proposed that the band be taken over by a private organization, with the Public Works Bureau providing a subsidy of no more than 150,000 yuan per year. From beginning to end, the Public Works Bureau has always deferred to the taxpayers' decisions regarding the band's existence. However, last year's proposal was also opposed and ultimately abandoned. This is the situation of repeated proposals and repeated withdrawals that has occurred in the past.</p>
<p>Last year, the band's chief conductor submitted his resignation to the board of directors, which was approved and took effect on October 31st. Later, the Public Works Bureau's Music Committee established a subcommittee to investigate the administrative improvements of the band, with particular emphasis on the separation of the chief conductor's administrative and musical duties. Soon after, the board of directors ordered the Music Committee to investigate whether the band could be reorganized in order to save money, or whether a band similar to the existing form should be retained.</p>
<p>According to the Music Subcommittee's proposal, the reorganization plan includes one symphonic orchestra and one brass band, with a staff consisting of one chief conductor, one assistant conductor, one brass band leader, and forty-four other musicians. After the band members are hired, they will not be entitled to the various benefits enjoyed by other Public Works Bureau employees. The employment contract also has the following provisions: The term of employment is set at one year, with all contracts expiring on the same date in order to maintain the continuity and effectiveness of the entire band until the last day of service. Notice of non-renewal of the contract, whether from the Bureau or band members, is effective one to three months after the notice date, depending on the musician's rank. Band members should have five to ten percent of their monthly salary deducted during the first year of their term, depending on their rank, as a fund to support the Public Works Bureau and as a guarantee that the members will fulfill their contracts. The deducted amount, along with interest, can be refunded upon final retirement. Each term includes one month of vacation. The annual cost of the reorganized band mentioned above is estimated to be around 200,000 yuan, while the annual cost of the existing band is around 300,000 yuan. Furthermore, according to the opinion expressed by the Subcommittee, this reorganized band is in no way inferior to the existing one.</p>
<p>When the Public Works Bureau's board of directors discussed this issue, in addition to deciding that if the band must be retained, it should be reorganized according to the Music Subcommittee's proposal, they deeply felt that the future of the Public Works Bureau's band should not be automatically decided by the board of directors, but should follow the previous example and be freely decided by the taxpayers. In order to facilitate the implementation of the taxpayers' decision after they have decided to completely abolish or reorganize the band, the existing band members' contracts should be scheduled to expire close to the date of the taxpayers' annual meeting. May 31st of this year is deemed the most appropriate date. If the taxpayers decide to maintain a band with the same number of members as the current one, this band should be organized in accordance with the methods proposed by the Music Subcommittee. All of the above have been approved by the Public Works Bureau's board of directors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the band's chief conductor, who submitted his resignation in mid-September last year, has agreed to temporarily continue serving until the end of May of this year after being retained by the Bureau.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the band's funding issue in the future, if the taxpayers insist on continuing to maintain the band's existence, the funding for the future should also be raised by the taxpayers. This is because the budget stipulated for this year for the Public Works Bureau's band (estimated to be 126,500 yuan) is only sufficient for use from January to the end of May of this year.</p>

<h3>Second Phase of Replacing Smokers' Licenses; Temporary Receipts No Longer Issued</h3>
<p>New Measures Decided by the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>During the period when the Public Security Bureau handled the registration of smokers, temporary license receipts were issued to smokers who registered to exchange their licenses after they had registered with the various sub-bureaus. Now, the Bureau has determined that this procedure is too tight, so starting from the second phase of license exchange, a new method has been adopted. It has been decided to stamp the old licenses with the words "Temporarily Replacing Second Phase License" and return them to the smokers for temporary use, ordering them to exchange their old licenses for new ones within one month, and temporary receipts will not be issued.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau, Requesting Orders Not to Obstruct Aviation Donation Collection</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng She reported that the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, with reference to the letter from the Shanghai Travel Industry Association stating that on March 18th, the Great China, Jue Lu, Shenzhou, Central, New World, and New Hui Zhong travel agencies, all members of the Public Concession, reported that the Public Concession police officers recently dispatched many detectives to force them to hand over all the aviation national salvation donation triplicate receipts, account books, etc., for examination, and stated that they were not allowed to continue collecting donations, otherwise they would be fined or have their business licenses revoked, etc., unreasonably forcing them to stop collecting donations, leaving no room for argument. They requested that we argue on their behalf. We have investigated that collecting aviation national salvation donations is a national patriotic movement and a duty that citizens should fulfill. What legal basis does the Public Works Bureau have to interfere? Our Association believes that this is not just a matter of suspending the aviation national salvation donation collection in one industry, but a serious incident of obstructing the entire aviation national salvation movement and violating the law. We request that your Association immediately forward a letter to the Public Works Bureau to lodge a serious protest, ensuring that the same situation does not occur again, in order to benefit the patriotic movement. Also, with reference to the letter from the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Aviation National Salvation Donation Collection Committee stating that our Association convened the industry to organize the Shanghai City Restaurant Industry Aviation National Salvation Donation Collection Committee, based on the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, to voluntarily raise aviation national salvation funds to assist the government in promoting aviation. We have already submitted a request to the Chinese Aviation Association, which was forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Since the collection began, the results have been good. Unexpectedly, the Concession authorities have been obstructing us in every possible way, and recently they have intensified their efforts, sending detectives to warn various restaurants and teahouses not to collect donations, otherwise their business licenses will be revoked, etc., and they have even torn down the Municipal Government's notices. According to the Concession authorities, this kind of action is obviously deliberately obstructing our people's patriotic movement. If we do not seriously negotiate, not only will the nation's prestige be swept away, but the position of our countrymen in the Concession will also lose its protection from now on. Our colleagues are indignant under this oppression, and we specially request your Association to negotiate vigorously to facilitate our progress." The above has been received by the Association, and the Executive Committee of the Association has discussed the proposal, stating that "the aviation national salvation donation of the patriotic movement has been legally authorized and no individual or national entity has the right to interfere or obstruct it, regardless of whether the interference or obstruction is in good or bad faith. The patriotic movement outside the Public Concession has never been interfered with or obstructed, which proves that the police's actions are not being carried out under orders. A resolution was immediately made to request the Public Works Bureau to strictly restrain [the police] and guarantee that the same incident will not occur again and must provide legal protection." Accordingly, we are sending this letter to your Bureau, urging you to strictly restrain [the police], guarantee that the same incident will not occur again, and provide legal protection, so as to avoid causing misunderstandings and complicating the situation. This is our earnest request. Sincerely, to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau."</p>
<h3>Korean Man Who Claimed His Wife Had a Nervous Breakdown Had Been Married Seven Times</h3>
<p>Japanese Consulate Proves Kim Woo-san Is Korean</p>
<p>But Kim Camel Ink Is Called a National Product</p>
<p>—Verdict in Case of False Imprisonment in Mental Hospital Scheduled—</p>
<p>Tianjin woman Pan Jingwen, a registrar at the Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital at 913 Haining Road, married Korean Kim Woo-san, the manager of the Kim Camel Ink Factory at 228 Changping Road, on November 1 last year. They lived together at 7, Lane 702, Gordon Road, but within a month of their marriage, cracks appeared in their relationship. Ms. Pan accused her husband of having an affair with a 19-year-old woman, Wang Jifang, while Kim claimed that Ms. Pan suffered from a nervous breakdown, which led to disputes. On the 12th of this month, Kim contacted the Shanghai Mental Hospital at 7 Chunjiang Villa, Lane 888, Connaught Road, and sent a car to take Ms. Pan to the hospital, where she was illegally detained and beaten. After the incident, Ms. Pan reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, accusing four people, including Dr. Chu Jiqun, nurse Gao Xinsheng, and servants Yang Cai Gou and Li A Mao, of restricting her freedom and committing assault in the First Special Court. Judge Liu Yugui had previously summoned them and ordered the four defendants to post bail and be available for questioning. As detailed in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judge Liu continued the hearing in the eighth criminal court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the adjournment, the police investigated Kim Woo-san's nationality with the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Consulate confirmed that Kim Woo-san held Korean nationality and thus fell under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Consulate. However, the victim, Pan Jingwen, submitted a newspaper advertisement dated March 18, which claimed that Kim Camel ink pens were completely made in China. Also, a letter from the National Economic Commission, also claimed that Kim Camel ink pens were made in China, so the point should be freely judged. Furthermore, the hospital had no female nurse. Defendant Chu Jiqun testified that the Mental Hospital was founded by Gu Wenjun, who was the director, and he was the doctor. When Ms. Pan was sent in, she showed symptoms of mental illness, and her pulse indicated phlegm and heat, so he prescribed medication. All the medicines he prescribed were to reduce phlegm and heat. Later, because Ms. Pan refused to take the medicine, she was tied to a chair and force-fed. Gao Xinkui testified that Kim Woo-san, Ms. Pan's husband, contacted the hospital and said that his wife suffered from a nervous breakdown. He went with Yang and Li to find Ms. Pan reading the newspaper, but she was talking to herself and cursing. After he failed to persuade her, he helped her onto the car and did not tie her up. Because Ms. Pan refused to take the medicine, she was tied down and force-fed according to procedure. He did not beat her. Yang and Li testified that they helped to force-feed the medicine and knew nothing else. Furthermore, Pan Jingwen testified that she did not have a nervous breakdown. She had met Kim several times before their marriage and traveled with him. If she had been sick, how could Kim have married a sick person? Furthermore, she found that she had joined Chinese nationality in 1933 and had a naturalization certificate. Kim had been married six times before and this was his seventh marriage. Judge Liu reserved judgment on the Kim Woo-san portion and began summing up in light of the clear facts. After the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, and the defendant's lawyer, Ji Qihong, had debated, the debate was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled for the 4th of next month. Each defendant remained on bail under their original bonds.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, while the detectives were discussing their plans with the store staff, the staff suddenly noticed a man in a blue long gown and two men in black long gowns, each wearing a felt hat, lingering near the store entrance. They occasionally peered inside, behaving suspiciously. Having learned from past experiences, the staff were already on alert and secretly informed the detectives. When the detectives turned to observe, the men seemed to notice and feigned nonchalance, nodding and whistling as they walked away. The detectives knew they were not good people and quickly left the store to pursue them.</p>
<p>Robbery at the Watch Shop</p>
<p>After leaving the Wang Taifeng store, the three men walked north along Shilu (Stone Road), turning onto Fuzhou Road. They were talking amongst themselves, as if plotting something. When they reached the Li Yongchang Watch Store at 477 Fuzhou Road, the three men entered together. The detectives stood across the street, watching from the entrance of the Daguan Garden Restaurant, observing their movements. They saw one man in a blue gown and one in a black gown pull out pistols and point them at the store staff, ordering them not to make a sound. Meanwhile, the third thief, wearing a black gown and unarmed, went to the cashier's counter, opened the drawers, and began to rob the store.</p>
<p>One Thief Shot</p>
<p>At that moment, pedestrians noticed people standing and watching at the Daguan Garden entrance, assuming something extraordinary was happening. More than twenty people stopped to observe. The thieves inside the store were also startled and realized something was wrong. They called out to the unarmed thief, who was carrying more than twenty yuan, and hurriedly left the store. As soon as they exited, the detectives rushed across the street. Seeing the thief with the money running west, they immediately drew their guns and opened fire, hitting the thief in the chest. He immediately fell at the entrance of the Shangjielu Bathhouse and was captured.</p>
<p>A Barrage of Gunfire</p>
<p>The remaining two armed thieves fled east, running north along Shilu (Stone Road). The detectives quickly turned back, blowing their whistles and joined by Chinese and Indian officers from the nearby patrol station, gave chase. The two thieves, seeing the danger, opened fire to resist arrest. The police officers responded with a barrage of gunfire. Bullets flew in all directions, sounding like continuous firecrackers. The two thieves fought and fled, fearing being hit. They turned west onto Hankou Road, then north to Daxin Street. At that time, Lao Zha police officers, including Western Detective Bao Tai, were patrolling the area and witnessed the scene. They immediately joined in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Chaos in the Streets</p>
<p>Seeing that police officers were closing in from both north and south and that bullets were raining down, the thieves, in desperation, had no clear escape route. They moved along the walls of shops on Daxin Street, turning onto Jiujiang Road and running east. Police officers followed them into Jiujiang Road, and officers from Nanjing Road also arrived to assist in the pursuit. The gunfire intensified, causing widespread panic among pedestrians. Shopkeepers and merchants, feeling as if a major robbery was about to occur, rushed to close their doors. Those who were confused and helpless feared being caught in the crossfire, but had nowhere to hide, leaving them no choice but to stand on the street, awaiting their fate.</p>
<p>Two Officers Shot</p>
<p>Amidst the great chaos and terror, the two thieves somehow disappeared into the crowd at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Fujian Road. Only when the detectives lost sight of their targets did the gunfire cease. In total, the two sides fired fifty to sixty shots. The thieves turned and fled through four streets, and the pursuit happened suddenly. During the pursuit, crowds of people scattered, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe, resulting in thirteen passersby being injured by stray bullets. In addition to the captured thief, two Chinese police officers were also shot.</p>
<p>Tea Room Worker Dies</p>
<p>The thief who fell at the entrance of the Shangjielu Bathhouse, wearing a brown woolen robe and appearing to be about 30 years old, died shortly after being taken to the hospital. The robbery proceeds were still on his person. Chen Youxiang, a 32-year-old tea server at the Tianxian Tea Garden at 566 Jiujiang Road, was exchanging coins at the entrance when a stray bullet struck him in the temple. He ran to the entrance of the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant, then collapsed inside. He was taken to the hospital, but died from his injuries. His body has been sent to the morgue for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Three Seriously Injured</p>
<p>There were three people seriously injured, including a woman named Lei Jinshi, 25 years old, from Jiangbei, living at 25 Shangxian Lane, Xinjibang Road. She was hit in the back on Fujian Road, the bullet impacting her chest. Her condition is critical. Zhou Fujin, 19 years old, from Guangdong, living in Zhonghua Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao, French Concession, worked as a tailor. He was shot in the right leg on Fujian Road. Liu Fusheng, 60 years old, a newspaper vendor, was injured in front of the Jiahe Hotel on Fujian Road, shot in the thigh. All three were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Nine Slightly Injured</p>
<p>Nine people were slightly injured: Xu Zhongzhen, 26 years old; Xue Pingsu, 31 years old; Tang Baoluo, 14 years old; Chen Fuqing, 33 years old; Ma Tanghai, 23 years old; Yao Zulang, 30 years old; Wu Qingwan, 18 years old; Zou Guiqing, 25 years old, a worker for the Shishi News; and Xu Zhongguang, 31 years old. All were injured on Daxin Street, shot in the legs or grazed by bullets. They were treated at the hospital and discharged. The two injured Chinese police officers, numbers 2972 and 3308, are from the Lao Zha police station, and were shot in the left and right legs. They were sent to the Public Works Department hospital for treatment. In addition, a windowpane was broken at the Wanchang Clothing Store at 231 Fujian Road and at the Datong Western Clothing Store at 278 Hubei Road. Fortunately, no one was injured. The intensity of the battle was evident. The two fleeing thieves are currently being pursued and will likely not escape justice.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mobilization Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association held its 53rd office meeting the day before yesterday (the 28th) to discuss the direction of fundraising efforts. General Secretary Li Dachao, Secretary Zhang Yuliang, and fourteen others attended. Chairman Li Dachao reported that provinces and cities, as well as their branches, had replied that they were raising funds to purchase aircraft to celebrate a birthday. The city has united with leaders from all sectors, agencies, and organizations to serve as initiators. Responses have been enthusiastic and it has been decided to solicit 2,000 to 5,000 individuals. Anyone who is dedicated to social causes, whether organizations or individuals, will be recruited to increase strength. Previous circulars to various mobilization teams called on the "Great Aviation to Save the Nation Movement" to intensify mobilization efforts. Field secretaries are requested to provide more assistance so that the mission can be completed as soon as possible. The two concession authorities have been intervening in the collection of aviation funds from the hotel and restaurant industries. Inquiries were made and the French Concession Police Department replied that fundraising by various industries is based on the principle of voluntary contribution, and there is no coercion and absolute non-interference. Notifications will be sent to the Hotel Trade Association and the Restaurant Fundraising Committee, and the two industries will be notified to proceed accordingly. Methods to improve fundraising efforts in the sand and gravel industries have been approved and the crushed stone industry has replied that it will begin a trial run on April 1st. The progress will be reviewed before a final decision is made. Jiang Weiqing, representing the shipowners along the city's rivers, officially requested that aviation funds be collected and has contacted them repeatedly. A meeting is scheduled for the 30th to discuss the matter. If there are no difficulties, a trial run will be initiated to satisfy the people's patriotic and voluntary enthusiasm. Various other industries have achieved excellent fundraising results. The Pudong District Aviation Exhibition will be held at the Lan Nidu YMCA in Pudong, beginning on April 1st and lasting for ten days. After closing, it will be moved to Kaifeng, Henan Province, at the request of the Henan branch, to popularize aviation and air defense knowledge among the public. Field secretaries then reported on the progress of contacting and inspecting various organizations. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

The enthusiasm and support of the Foreign Tea Merchants Association is greatly appreciated. A letter of thanks has been sent. It is hoped that other trade associations and people from all walks of life will be inspired to donate generously. The committee's solicitation of individuals, organizations, and groups to serve as initiators for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations has been very successful. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau, Tongzhi Hall, Foreign Tea Merchants Association, Changzhou Fellow Provincial Association, and the First District Education Association of Shanghai also joined as organizations, and community leaders Li Jing, Zhang, Jing Shi, Xu Guan, Su Ben, and others also participated to carry out the campaign.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing's Letter to the Japanese Consul General</h3>
<p>Regarding the Confiscation of Crew Security Deposits on the Songshan Maru</p>
<p>Requesting the Nisshin Steamship Company to Investigate and Reply</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General yesterday, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from my fellow townsman Xu Jincai, Jincai has been the head of the fire cabin department on the Nisshin Steamship Company's Songshan Maru for more than fifteen years. He has always been law-abiding and has not committed any offenses. Last September, the ship sailed from Guangdong to Shanghai. Upon arrival, customs officials discovered artificial silk in the passengers' cabin. Jincai was dismissed, and 40 yuan was deducted from the salaries of his friends and workers each month as a security deposit (commonly known as 'ya gui'). By the time of separation, eighteen months had been accumulated, totaling 720 yuan. He has repeatedly requested the company to release the funds, but has been refused. According to the procedures for punishing crew members carrying private goods, the responsibility lies with the personnel of the area where the goods were found. The deck is not part of the fire cabin, so Jincai should not be held responsible. It is clear. Now the company forcibly uses Jincai's security deposit as a fine, and it is unknown under which rules this is based. Therefore, I have no choice but to request that you forward this letter to the Japanese Consul General, instructing the company to investigate the circumstances and location of the seizure at that time, so as not to punish the innocent. I also request a reply, which would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Asks Finance Ministry to Abolish Special Consumption Tax in Baihe County</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Province Continues to Collect Taxes Against Orders, Causing Great Suffering to the People</p>
<p>Please Order Promptly to Cancel the Tax to Alleviate Merchants' Difficulties</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, the following is from a letter from the Baihe County Chamber of Commerce in Shaanxi Province: 'The special consumption tax was originally intended to compensate for the reduction of the lijin tax. Since the revision of the business tax, this special tax has been ordered to be abolished. However, the political situation in Shaanxi is different, and the tax continues to be collected, adding to the burden of the people. Our chamber of commerce petitioned the authorities to abolish it in 1933 and convert it to an ordinary business tax. The Ministry of Finance approved the petition, stating that the special commissioner in Shaanxi had been ordered to cease collection. Several years have passed, but the collection continues, and the people's suffering has deepened. In November of last year, our chamber of commerce again presented a petition to the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Finance Department, but it was not approved. Seeing no other way, we must again petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to abolish the tax, and request that your association argue on our behalf and appeal to achieve the goal of abolition. The above is the content of the letter. We hereby respectfully telegraph this information to your ministry for review. We earnestly request that you promptly order the abolition of the tax to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.' The chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, bows and seals."</p>

<h3>Change of French Consul and Judge</h3>
<p>Because France has consular jurisdiction in China, the French government sends a judge to preside over lawsuits involving French citizens and cases where Chinese citizens are plaintiffs and French citizens are defendants.

After the establishment of the Second Special District Chinese Court, the French Concession Municipal Council hired him as the chief legal advisor to the police force. His concurrent position as president of the French Consular Court was temporary. It is now reported that the French government has sent Judge Guo Fumin to Shanghai to serve as the formal president of the court. It is said that Mr. Guo arrived in Shanghai recently and will take office on April 1st. Mr. Dugue will return to his position as a police legal advisor on the same day, and Deputy Consul General Jia Dang, who was temporarily acting as a police legal advisor, is scheduled to return to France on April 8th.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "The following is from the Shanghai Municipal Government's Order No. 17469: 'The following is from the Ministry of Finance's You Qian telegram: "Since the nickel and copper coins were issued on the 10th of this month, counterfeit coins have been circulating in the market, causing public confidence to waver. The criminals who manufactured these counterfeit coins must have large-scale premeditation. We request that your ministry take immediate measures to crack down on them and bring them to justice, so that this great evil does not go unpunished, causing endless troubles. 'A document was presented for this purpose. It is hoped that you will immediately take decisive action, conduct a secret investigation, so as to maintain the government's authority and strengthen people's faith. The forging of currency disrupts finance and hinders monetary policy, which is an extremely serious matter. Accordingly, you are requested to instruct the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation, arrest the counterfeit auxiliary currency dealers, and investigate and destroy the counterfeit manufacturing agencies. They should be sent to the court for severe punishment to stabilize society and maintain the currency system. We hope that you will forward this order to be followed and report the situation so that it can be reviewed.'"</p>

<h3>Jiang Dagen's Lecture: The Cultural Era of the Wangbishan Ruins (2)</h3>
<p>The Current State of the Ruins: There are remnants of an earthen city wall above the ruins. The western side of the earthen city wall has suffered greater damage due to the passage of roads, the construction of houses, and the accumulation of tombs, resulting in fewer remaining traces. Only a small portion near the south side still has remnants of the city wall. Most of it can no longer be distinguished from the ground. The eastern side of the city is in better condition than the western side. Except for the places where thoroughfares pass and a temple at the northern end of the thoroughfare where the city wall has been leveled, most other parts are still clearly visible. The southern side of the city is scattered with countless tombs, high and low, inside the city and on the city wall. But from the outside of the city, the traces of the city wall rising above the ground are very clear. The northern side of the city is the most obvious side in terms of the shape of the city wall. Amidst the tombs, embrasures can still be seen standing tall and low on the ground. The highest part is over ten feet high, intermittently, like several small earthen mountains, hence the name Wangbishan (King Wall Mountain).</p>
<p>Inside the city, fragments of ancient pottery and porcelain can be picked up everywhere. These fragments can be found not only inside the earthen city but also on the river beaches near the earthen city. Even in front of the Zhiping Temple on the west bank of Shihu Lake, they can still be found. I remember on the morning of January 17th this year, when I and Mr. Cao Yadan accompanied Mr. Zhang Tianfang of Jiashan to investigate there, we also picked up a broken ancient tile bench in that place. This very likely suggests that people lived inside and outside the city at that time, so there are traces of human activity both inside and outside the city.</p>
<p>According to the map of Wu County from the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Wangbishan was barren and only suitable for building tombs. Therefore, this place was not suitable for cultivation in the past. There are two reasons why this place was not suitable for cultivation: ⑴ The ground is higher than the surrounding areas. ⑵ There is too much gravel underground. All places where humans live tend to gradually elevate their addresses to prevent the intrusion of moisture. All places where humans live tend to have more rubble due to the metabolism of old buildings and old utensils. The reason why Wangbishan is not suitable for cultivation is really because there is a very rich ruins hidden underground. The current situation is slightly different from before. The high and gravelly places have been gradually reclaimed into rice fields by diligent farmers, regardless of the cost. But there are still many highlands that have not been reclaimed.</p>

<p>School Survey</p>
<h3>Overview of the French School in Shanghai (1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council has established two Western children's primary and secondary schools in Shanghai: one is located at 11 Huanlong Road, called the French School; the other is located at 200 Remi Road, called Remi Elementary School. The French School was founded in 1911 AD and has a history of 25 years; all school facilities are well-equipped. Remi Elementary School was opened three years ago and is smaller in scale, with the interior still under development; and it only enrolls children of Russian immigrants. Therefore, this article mainly focuses on the facilities of the French School. I am very grateful to Mr. Gobo Ai, the Director of School Affairs of the Education Department of the French Public Concession Bureau, and Mr. Ji Ermeng, the Principal of the French School, for providing a lot of materials for this article!</p>
<p>I. A School with International Character</p>
<p>The French School was originally named French Municipal College, which should be translated as the Western Children's Middle School established by the French Concession Municipal Council; for the sake of simplicity, the current name is used. In English, College means university college; while in French, College refers to middle school. The length of study in French middle schools is seven years, while primary schools are only five years; so the combined length of study for primary and secondary schools is still twelve years. The school is affiliated with primary schools and kindergartens, and the school system can be called complete. The school was first founded in 1911 at 247 Avenue Joffre; at that time, the school had only 80 students. Now the school has complete primary and secondary schools, and the number of students in the school has increased to 430 this semester. The school is co-educational; there are currently 190 boys and 240 girls.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Gobo Ai, Director of School Affairs of the Education Department of the French Public Concession Bureau, the biggest feature of the school is its international character. The enrolled children of the school include the nationality of twenty-six countries; and all the training facilities in the school are aimed at the international perspective. In 1931, Mr. Langevin, a member of the French delegation of the International Federation of Educational Examination Teams and a professor at the University of France, visited the school and highly praised the school's implementation of international education. The school's training facilities will be described in the following sections. Now, the statistics of the number of children of all nationalities in the school are copied as follows:</p>
<p>French children 169 German children 2</p>
<p>Chinese children 39 American children 8</p>
<p>British children 11 Vietnamese children 2</p>
<p>Argentine children 1 Armenian children 3</p>
<p>Austrian children 1 Belgian children 2</p>
<p>Canadian children 1 Dominican children 1</p>
<p>Spanish children 1 Greek children 5</p>
<p>Italian children 7 Latvian children 1</p>
<p>Lithuanian children 2 Polish children 8</p>
<p>Portuguese children 17 Romanian children 2</p>
<p>Russian children 136 Czechoslovak children 1</p>
<p>Estonian children 2 Uruguayan children 2</p>
<p>Swiss children 3 Syrian children 3</p>
<p>Total number of children from 26 countries 430</p>

<h3>Securities: Mostly Retail Selling, Public Bond Trading Slightly Increased, Prices Show Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was slightly more lively, and trading also increased slightly. However, large investors' trading remained low. Retail investors were quite active. The overall environment remained dull, without any significant progress. The supply and demand of chips were relatively frequent, but the trading parties did not have firm objectives, entering and exiting uncertainly, quite fleeting. After hovering for a long time, prices finally declined slightly. If the decline could continue for one or two yuan, trading would naturally be brisk. However, judging from the closing trend, there were signs of firmness, and it was feared that it would not be possible to quickly break away from the hovering state. Yesterday, the opening price was for the No. 11 sell order. Retail investors bought in, and the market price of Class C immediately dropped by 4.5 cents, with the rest dropping by a small 0.1 to 0.3 cents.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Both Spot Yarn and Cotton Sales Are Good</h3>
<p>Spot cotton yarn sales are gradually becoming more active, with significant activity in the South China region. At the same time, the situation of overseas cotton yarn has universally turned towards higher prices, boosting confidence. There are also reports of Qingdao yarn prices rebounding by three to four yuan, further enhancing market confidence. However, the yarn stored in yarn and cloth warehouses still lacks liquidity. Because the most accurate yarn and cotton market is undergoing settlement procedures for this month, it is closed. According to statistics, various groups bought 1,010 bales of spot yarn, with selling prices rising by 0.5 to 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton: The spot cotton market is slightly better, with overseas cotton prices trending higher, but factory purchases have not yet developed on a large scale. Fire-machine cotton is 49.5 yuan. 500 bales of Dong cotton were imported, delivered to Jardine Matheson. Delinted cotton is 62.5 yuan. Gongda Factory imported 174 pieces, with spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>Over 9,000 Bales of Marked Yarn Delivered</h3>
<p>The March term Golden Rooster Marked Yarn was launched on October 1 of the previous year, with a price of 170.05 yuan. At that time, market sentiment was trending positively, and undercurrents were developing. At the same time, rumors were rampant, and marked gold prices surged in a straight line, with new peaks emerging endlessly. Later, rumors of currency reform became increasingly tense. Moreover, the local yarn inventory gradually decreased, and an increasing number of yarn factories were suspending or closing operations due to unfavorable conditions, resulting in a sharp decrease in production. Consequently, market prices advanced. After the national government announced the implementation of the new currency policy on November 4, banks, gold merchants, and securities firms all rushed to buy in, causing the market to soar. Market prices rose from 80 yuan and 90 yuan to over 200 yuan. By December 4, it reached a peak of 210 yuan. Subsequently, due to intense competition between the long and short positions, there were ups and downs. Moreover, the industry prepared spot supplies, and overseas three-grade American cotton consistently fell. Also, at the end of the year-end settlement period, the warehouse yarn inventory exceeded 28,000 bales before re-entering the 200 yuan range. Recently, due to active spring sales and soaring yarn prices in other regions, the financial community, seeing the sluggishness of public bond marked gold, gathered in the yarn and cotton market. Furthermore, the recent easing of credit has been conducive to cotton yarn investment and absorption. Spot yarn is closed and not released. At the same time, the National Trust and Mainland Bank received 5,000 bales this month, which boosted confidence. Market prices recovered to good levels, reaching 207.4 yuan. The final price of 203.1 yuan was a significant increase of 32.6 yuan compared to the initial price. As a result, a total of 9,200 bales remained to be delivered, an increase of 1,050 bales compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the average of the last three days, was 204 yuan, an increase of 11 yuan compared to the previous month. The delivered goods included 3,100 bales of 20-count Big Flying Boat, Red Kui Xing, Jincheng, Double Deer, Samsung, Tianguan, Three Sheep, Bao Yi, and Awakening Lion yarn, among others. The rest were self-delivered. It is said that the banking sector led the receivers, and yarn merchants and yarn factories were mostly the deliverers. The brokerage firms and contents of both receiving and delivering parties are listed below (unit: bales).</p>

<h3>46,000 Dan of Futures Cotton Delivered</h3>
<p>The March term marked cotton was launched on October 1 of last year, with a price of 32.085 yuan. At that time, North China was experiencing severe floods, cotton fields were devastated, and new cotton production was severely affected. Moreover, estimates repeatedly indicated a reduction, and confidence gradually shifted towards bullishness, with market prices entering a stable path. Later, due to sluggish yarn sales and poor factory demand, coupled with American cotton reports indicating increased production but stable prices, and unfavorable domestic cotton production, coupled with the precarious situation in Europe and the looming Italian-Ethiopian war, American three-grade cotton all trended higher. On November 4, the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of currency reform. On that day, the opening price jumped by 3 yuan, breaking through 40 yuan. On December 4, the peak reached 45.5 yuan. Subsequently, due to the year-end period and American cotton futures also breaking through the 1-cent mark, and Indian cotton falling by more than 20 rupees, market prices declined. By February 8 of this year, it was seen again at 40.05 yuan. Subsequently, the banking sector absorbed and held on, adopting a buy-on-dips strategy, and prices rebounded again. The final price was 43.95 yuan, a sharp increase of 11 yuan compared to the initial price. As a result, a total of 46,000 dan remained to be delivered, a decrease of 12,600 dan compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the average of the last three days, was 44 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous month. The delivered goods were mostly Ling Shi cotton, including Tianjin American cotton, Hankou fine lint, and Hankou coarse lint, etc. It is said that Japanese merchant Dongmian received 15,000 dan, and there were many arbitrageurs. On the delivery side, cotton merchants from Hankou and Shanghai were the majority. The brokerage firms and business names of both receiving and delivering parties, as well as the receiving contents, are listed below (unit: dan).</p>

<h3>Over 60,000 Bales of Cotton Yarn Traded</h3>
<p>The development of cotton yarn and cotton cloth consumption in this city recently has been unprecedented in recent years. From late January to the middle of this month, it has been booming, with sales prices soaring day after day. The purchasing power in the interior is unexpectedly strong, but by the end of the month, it turned weak, and market prices have stagnated. The following is a list of the quantity of spot cotton yarn traded in this city by Chinese and Japanese merchants during the two months of February and March (unit: bales).</p>
<p>February March Early 6,898 10,703 Mid 14,785 17,369 Late 13,209 3,113 Total 33,892 31,185</p>
<p>That is, 33,892 bales in February and 31,185 bales in March, totaling 65,077 bales by the 27th. Most of them were purchased by Tianjin merchants and inland merchants.</p>
<p>It seems that Japanese spinners have already sold the July delivery. Foreign firms have sold about 50,000 to 60,000 bales to Chinese merchants, including both spot and forward goods.</p>
<p>As for cotton cloth, the textile industry has prepared until May, and the larger quantities in April should be sold out. Foreign firms have sold about 30,000 to 40,000 bales to Xinghua merchants. The reasons for the recent activity in yarn and cloth are mainly due to the current peak season for spring sales, which has led to prosperous sales. In the past, the local financial investment industry had a large amount of idle funds in exchange rates, marked gold, and public bonds. These markets are now completely stagnant, so they have all turned to the yarn, cotton, and cotton cloth markets.</p>
<h3>Bombay Cotton Exports Lower Than Last Week</h3>
<p>The market was narrow and firm last week. The main transactions were in April-May delivery white Rohilkhand cotton. Exporters shifted some of their hedging to the July-August delivery. Export transactions were quieter. Japanese demand was very active, but due to the sluggish domestic stock market and yarn market, it also became quieter. Mainland demand was normal. Lancashire sales were more active, mostly for long-staple cotton, which was continuously absorbed due to its low price. In the spot market, exporters were the main buyers. Attached is the weekly statistic (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<h3>Three Types of Yarn and Cotton Rise</h3>
<p>Osaka cable on the 30th: There was only half a day of trading in the three types today. Futures yarn rose by 1.1 to 0.5 yuan, with the near-month at 193.5 yuan and the far-month at 194.9 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 0.45 to 0.95 yuan, with the near-month at 63.4 yuan and the far-month at 61.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rumor of Foreign Wheat Import, Marked Flour Floats, Then Sold Off And Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, presented a picture of initial stability followed by weakness in each month. The quoted price for foreign wheat showed a small decline of 0.2 cents for Chicago near-term and 0.4 cents for far-term. At the opening, due to continued buying by outside investors, although trading was not very smooth, the market was slightly stable, 0.075 cents better than the previous weekend. Afterwards, the market hovered, with little movement. By the afternoon opening, this month was the last few sessions. Due to fewer actual sales, the market showed minimal change. The ending price was slightly lower by 0.01 cents compared to the morning. For June and beyond, there were rumors that the factory had previously ordered foreign wheat, and that a ship would be arriving, so confidence weakened, with many short sellers taking action, pulling back 0.01 to 0.02 cents compared to the morning. However, the domestic new wheat season is still far off, so confidence is not easily overly impacted.</p>

<h3>Futures Wheat: Inland Confidence Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was generally flat across all months, with foreign wheat consistently reporting weakness and the weather remaining clear and smooth. Inevitably, confidence in inland areas waned. However, trading was not smooth, with little activity. By the afternoon opening, trading was even quieter, with little change in the market. Because old wheat has already stopped being auctioned, and new wheat awaits the new season, future trading is temporarily difficult to develop. The spot wheat market remains active, and prices remain stable, with Shandong Yaowan wheat at 5.35 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 5.32 yuan. Fuxin bought 3,000 bags, and Fufeng bought 500 bags.

<h3>Thick Early Japonica Arrives Scarcely, Price Established</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups arrived, totaling more than 30, (goods totaling more than 6,000 piculs,) mostly thin rice, and the leftover goods from consecutive days are also abundant, while stomach for purchases is even lighter. The Tianjin and Dayun groups only handled 1,500 to 1,600 bags together, so the thin rice market continued to fall in price. The thick early japonica market in this street was also stagnant, but fortunately, the goods were scarce, so the price was still firm. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan remained flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived from various roads along the river. The market's appetite for various goods was low. White japonica rice was stagnant and quiet. The price of Zhongjue was down by about 0.1 yuan. Chang group's special white japonica rice was not opened. The price of thin rice was down by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. The price of Yin Yuan was down by 1 yuan. The price of Bian Yuan was down by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. Yang Du Bu Xian was down by nearly 1 foot. The guest rice was stagnant and sluggish, with the price down by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The other rice varieties were generally soft.</p>
<h3>Guest Xian Market Shows Signs of Rising</h3>
<p>Sales Continue in This Street</p>
<p>Yesterday, guest xian rice arrivals continued, with shipments arriving from various ports in the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang. However, arrivals and sales were balanced, and the market had stabilized. Yesterday, in addition to continuous transactions in this street, some small buyers hoarded and absorbed Jiangxi machine rice, so the market showed signs of turning bullish again. If there are whole batches available for hoarding in the coming days, the market may have to rise because current restrictions in various production areas are very strict, costs are high, and except for medium and low-grade broken rice, foreign rice is generally not allowed to enter, so the market is already showing a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Yesterday, 1,050 bags of Jiangxi rice, 900 bags of Taiwan rice, 500 bags of Jiangbei rice, 200 bags of Shashi rice, and 100 bags of a certain rice were offered. Except for a certain household buying more than 1,000 bags of Gan rice, all were handled by this street, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Price Surge Revives</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market, due to the increasingly tense international situation, fearing that once a war breaks out, it will hinder the source of supply, so confidence is gradually bullish. Niuzhuang oil once opened at 21 yuan. Therefore, although its loan market price once fell, it soon advanced again. Dalian oil is only slightly lower than the peak of the first ten days of the month. Yesterday, the market opened at 20.01 yuan, Niuzhuang oil from ships opened at 20.09 yuan, oil from local factories was 20.02 yuan, Dalian Qishan oil was 20 yuan, and oil that is not yet available for five or six days was 19.9 yuan. The situation is still tense, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yellow Bean Market Conditions Continue to Be Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market conditions, although Niuzhuang has already thawed and goods from that area can arrive, the market price continues to be brisk. The reason is that the production price in Niuzhuang is high, and the arrival of goods is delayed. However, the price of soybean cake in this city is gradually tightening, and raw seeds are expected to rise. Therefore, the appetite of oil pressing plants and inland workshops was strong yesterday, and the market price was able to rise. Compared to last week, the price rose by 0.2 yuan. It is said that more than 1,000 bags of Lanhe River beans, two cars of Bengbu beans were opened, and eight cars of Sipingjie beans for delivery tomorrow and nineteen cars of Liaodong beans for delivery in a week were ordered.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Trades More Actively</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend remained flat, but customs gold has slightly tightened, and the turning point may lie here. The guild's clearing price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 22 yuan, slightly down by 0.05 yuan, and transshipment cargo was 6.98 yuan, slightly down by 0.02 yuan, both with transactions.

Domestic Qing and White sugar of a certain number were not reopened, only more than 100 bags of Hongfa Ruhua (glutinous rice noodles) were opened, with a price of 10 yuan, up by 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company held its exchange period yesterday.

<h3>Miscellaneous: Lily Bulbs Arrive with Both Supply and Inventory Lacking, Production Area Has Few Goods! Market Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Lily bulbs are produced in Huzhou, Zhejiang, and mostly sold to Guangdong. Other places such as Yingkou and Dalian in the north also have some sales. This year, due to the thin inventory, the price has risen from 18 yuan to over 20 yuan. Recently, both supply and inventory are lacking, and the price has risen from 26 yuan to 28 yuan, with a total increase of 10 yuan. It is said that the smallest price in previous years was only about 9 yuan. However, although the current price is high, it is heard that the inventory in the production area will be exhausted, and the sales season is still long, so the price may rise to over 30 yuan. Lily powder has also risen accordingly, it is said.</p>
<h3>Finance in the Past Year (8)</h3>
<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>With ample preparation by various banks and strengthening market credit. The public's habits of using banknotes is increasing, coupled with the outflow of cash in rural areas, leading to a shortage of spot commodities, and banknotes become a tool for payment. Results from the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan means that sporadic tael payment, which used to require payment by cashier's check, are now switched to payment via bank notes. The majority of banks exert great effort toward promotion of banknotes. The tables below list the amount of banknote issuance per bank (note 12), to examine the outline, which requires a bit of explanation.</p>
<p>Issue amount of Shanghai Hua Shang Banks in the year of 1935 (unit yuan)</p>
<p>Banknotes and interest rates are codependent, when there is an excess of goods on the market, the interest rates are low: when goods become scarce, the interest rates increase, but throughout the year the increase and decrease of Shanghai market banknote issuance does not seem to correlate to interest rate increase or decrease, in other words, the issuing of banknotes cannot adjust interest rates. Try comparing the tables and in the second chapter the market interest rates are lower. For example in March the amount of issuance was 36.9 million yuan, the lowest interest rate was 6%, and the highest was at most 10%, when the amount of banknote issuance increased, the interest rate conversely became more expensive, for example in November the amount of banknote issuance was 55.6 million yuan, and the interest rate was 20%, and the lowest rate was 12%.</p>
<p>Reviewing last year's paper money issuance from Shanghai banks, the central bank saw surprising growth. In November, the bank's issuance volume increased to 15,089,294 yuan. Please review the chart below.</p>
<p>Recent chart comparing Shanghai bank issuance amounts</p>
<p>Since the finance department regulations on November 3rd, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, banknotes were legal tender, other banknotes from other banks were to be managed through the issuance and preparation administration, so by the end of last year, the processing was in place. The Central Bank received China Agriculture and Commerce bank and China General Commerce bank, The Bank of Communications receiving China Industrial bank, China Bank of Industry, and Zhe Jiang Industry Bank. After that there would be no more reports, besides the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The eleven month amounts listed in the section above, were gathered from the Bank of China economic institute on November 3rd.</p>
<p>The amount of note exchanging and money shop public bond settlements indicate prosperity of the city, the note exchange office was founded in 1932, so the qualifications are lower, cannot be referred to like money shop public bonds: (note 14:)</p>
<p>Year of 1935 Shanghai bank and money shop note exchange and public bond amounts. (unit thousand yuan)</p>
<p>Shanghai silver and money industry, note exchange amounts, if compared to the year before's exchange amounts, the year before sees a decrease of 500 million or 400 million of amount that is huge, indicating that last year industrial commerce and the financial industry were depressed, to a greater extent compared to before.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Chen Jianju)</p>
<p>If the moon could become a clear mirror, reflecting everything on earth, the moans and miserable conditions of our compatriots in the Northeast would be clearly reflected in everyone's eyes. Then the five minutes of patriotic fervor might be extended, and those who are "living in a drunken dream" and "numb and insensitive" might have a spark of patriotic emotion ignited.</p>
<p>A person who puts on the glasses of "profit only" cannot see any "justice" or "sympathy" in the world. In the dictionary of the "profit-only person," there are only words like "plunder" and "extort."</p>
<p>Grass sprouts as thin as hair can also break through the hard crust of the earth. The greatness of the will to survive can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing in life is "mediocrity," because special people cannot be created in a "mediocre" life; moreover, "mediocre" life becomes dull and tasteless when it is overdone. One must experience all the joys, sorrows, and bitterness to truly appreciate the taste of life.</p>
<h3>A Comical Method of Revenge</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yu</p>
<p>Now there is no tea in the Italian tea rooms; what is prepared for customers to drink is only a kind of herbal water. This herbal water is brewed with a palatable herb produced in Eritrea, which is considered a drink that loyal patriots should drink. Eritrea is an Italian East African colony, and the products of the colony can be regarded as domestic products, while tea is a product of British India. Since Britain advocates the most intense sanctions against Italy, of course, it is necessary to retaliate and boycott British goods. Coffee can be eaten because it is shipped from Brazil, and Brazil is not in the alliance that approved the sanctions. At the same time, good Italian citizens receive a warning that wearing British-made clothes is an act of treason.</p>
<p>Similar things are very common in times of extreme international tension. During the Boer War, French public opinion expressed dissatisfaction, and newspapers severely attacked Britain. One Englishman picked up an axe and smashed his dining table because it was coated with French varnish. His momentary righteous indignation vent on the table coated with French varnish. By analogy, if an Italian received British broadcast music and songs on a radio, he would destroy the radio. It is not enough to smash it to pieces to vent the anger in his chest. As for listening to radio broadcasts, it is a dangerous hobby for people living under a dictatorial regime under any circumstances. Recently, two Germans were sentenced to four years of hard labor for listening to Moscow radio broadcasts and participating in political discussions.</p>
<h3>Co-education</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>Speaking of the matter of "co-education," it was only after many people advocated and agreed that the fact of "co-education" came into being, but it was produced under a very strong atmosphere of opposition. In fact, men go to school to study, and women go to school to study as well, so why the opposition and support? It's really strange that people are too nosy.</p>
<p>However, according to the report of Ms. × on × night, I feel that "co-education" is somewhat different.</p>
<p>She said: "Co-education is somewhat unfree. Every move is restricted. Especially for us female students, if we are not careful, we will inevitably cause more trouble. Those male students like to make fun of us female students, making faces, frowning, winking... all kinds of ugly behaviors, it really makes us want to call for our mothers. Once, during class, a male student threw chalk at my face, once, twice, three times... more than a dozen times in a row. However, it didn't hurt at all, so I decided on the 'do not care' policy. As a result, the chalk no longer somersaulted on my face. But, there are also some advantages. If we want to ask those male students to do something, they are really as docile as a little goat. We tell them to do whatever, and they will do whatever. They never want to disobey. This makes us female students feel very convenient. When I was in a girls' school, I never received such good fortune."</p>
<h3>Construction for Opening Roads and Transportation</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>After listening to Ms. ×'s words, I also felt that "co-education" is fine, "men and women not studying together" is also fine, supporting it is fine, and not supporting it is also fine.</p>
<h3>A Phoenix Replaces the Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near the Double Ninth Festival, A Small Gathering to Seek Seclusion, Linking Pearls to Warm Old Dreams, Drinking with Regret for Thousands of Autumns</p>
<p>He sat down and said with a smile first: Your mood hasn't been very good these days, has it? I shook my head and said; It doesn't matter. Living in this tall Western-style house, eating meals with two dishes and a soup, and wearing clothes that keep me from freezing, life is just like this. What's wrong with my mood? Lan Chang smiled and said: We all have that scholarly air, worrying about the world even without half an acre of land. Plus, your family is all in Beiping, and you are eager to go north, but the environment does not allow you to go north, so you are naturally uneasy. I sat at the writing desk, picked up a small mirror on the table, and looked at myself. I felt that I was a person over middle age, so I smiled at Lan Chang and said: Brother Lan, we are the same age, but looking at your graceful demeanor, you still look like a young man. I am old. Lan Chang smiled and said: I am trying to persuade you, and you are only complaining. I came to Daoli today not for anything else. A goldfish and chrysanthemum exhibition will be held in Suzhou Park soon, and I would like to invite you to see it. Hearing this, I raised a hand and scratched my disheveled hair, showing my hesitation with a smile. He completely understood what I meant. He smiled and said: I thought you might not have that leisure at this time. But my original purpose was to supply you with some novel materials. I smiled and said: Too many people have been to Suzhou. As I said, I took a cigarette from the pipe on the table and handed it over with both hands. I also took a cigarette and leaned back in the writing chair to smoke. Lan Chang crossed his legs and sat on the sofa opposite me. He stretched the cigarette ash over the ashtray on the coffee table, hooked a forefinger, and slowly flicked off the ash on the cigarette. Then he smiled and said: Of course, I don't want you to use Suzhou as a background to write a novel. Nor do I want you to get any material from the fish and chrysanthemum exhibition. Currently, at my home in Suzhou, there is a diary of my friend and some works left by my friend's girlfriend, which can allow you to spend a day at my home to read all those documents. If there is anything you don't understand, you can ask me. Aren't these some good novel materials? I smiled and said, Ha! About men and women, and it's your friend, it must be good. But since you have so much material to provide me, why not bring it to Shanghai and let me read it once? Why do I have to run back and forth hundreds of miles? Lan Chang said: If I could bring it, I would have brought it today, but I am entrusted with a heavy responsibility and must take those things seriously. If I carry a briefcase around, I might lose someone's things. To be honest, I keep these things at home, carefully stored in my personal study. Not to mention strangers who cannot see those documents, even my room is not easy to enter. (1)</p>
<p>Old Stories</p>
<h3>Records of Criminal Fun</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is nearly a century away from the present, and its criminal law inevitably includes the so-called beheading and public display of the head! The procedure was to put the beheaded head in a bamboo basket, carried by two soldiers, with one soldier ringing a gong and loudly shouting: "So-and-so has committed such-and-such a crime and is hereby beheaded and displayed to the public!" They walked around everywhere before burying the head. In the case of adultery, the heads of both the man and the woman must be carried together for the parade. In the case of rape, the soldiers also carried the head, and the raped woman had to follow behind. According to the rules, the women themselves had to loudly report: "So-and-so raped me, and is now beheaded and displayed to the public!" But those who wanted to save their face mostly just lowered their heads and followed, unwilling to shout according to the rules. This responsibility of announcing the crime had to be shouldered by the gong-ringing soldier.</p>
<p>In the autocratic era of the former Qing dynasty, women also had to kneel under the desk of the government office to be tried. If they did not agree with a word, the magistrate would get angry and give them a beating with a wooden board, with no chance to bargain. But the women were mostly shy - enduring the pain was secondary - when they had to take off their pants in public and expose their bodies to be beaten. They always hesitated and begged, delaying this embarrassing situation. Although most of the servants were used to being strong and domineering, and it was a matter of serving on official business, they could use coercive means, but after all, they were hindered by the great defense of etiquette between men and women, and for a while, they felt very embarrassed! Then, when this kind of situation occurred, the servants of the public affairs would show their abilities - mostly from the teaching of the old gentlemen. The servant stepped forward, approached her ear, and whispered, "It's better to be quick. Please do it yourself. If you delay like this, the magistrate will add more strokes to your board, and we will inevitably have to serve you. If the servant takes the initiative to untie the pants of the criminal woman, then the criminal woman should be slept with once. This is the old rule. We servants think it's unlucky to reach out to serve the criminal woman in this matter, and we have to break it in that way. Why do you have to?" When those poor women heard his soft and hard words - lies, none of them were not anxious, and had no choice but to shyly and shamefully reveal their buttocks and endure the corporal punishment of the board!</p>
<p>During the Three Kingdoms period, the Shu Kingdom suddenly suffered a severe drought, and the court ordered a ban on alcohol, stipulating that those who brewed alcohol would be punished. The officials and servants used tricks to invade people's homes, searched for brewing tools, and punished them for the same crime as the brewers. For a time, many families suffered misfortune because they had brewing tools that had been placed for a long time and occasionally lost track of them. One day, General Zhaode, Jian Yong, followed Liu Xianzhu in disguise to travel through the market. He suddenly raised his hand and pointed to a passing man, telling Xianzhu, "This man is going to commit adultery, why not arrest him?" Xianzhu said, "How do you know?" Jian Yong replied, "He carries adulterous tools, no different from having brewing tools at home." Xianzhu laughed and ordered the harsh ban to be lifted.</p>
<h3>Skinning the Pig</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a cartoon of "skinning the pig": a gangster pointed a gun at an old countryman, who panicked and took off his coat for the gangster. But the gangster took the coat and still pointed the gun at him. He took off his underwear for the gangster. The gangster took the underwear and still pointed the gun at him. He even took off his pants for the gangster. However, although the gangster got all his property, his gun was still pointing at him, forcing him to the river beach and sending him to his death.</p>
<p>This old countryman thought that the gangster would leave after getting the coat, so he repeatedly gave way. As a result, he gave all his clothes to the gangster. But the gangster's greed was never satisfied, so in the end, he gave his life to the gangster.</p>
<p>If this old countryman had attacked the gangster quickly and bravely when he first met him, then the gangster would not only dare to move again, but would probably not even have time to escape. But this old countryman gave way, and as a result, he not only gave away his clothes, but also gave away his life, and also got the ugly name of "pig".</p>
<p>However, this old countryman's fear, cowardice, and concession to the "skinning pig" gangster, and the result of eventually becoming a dead "pig," is really the reason why the "pig" is a "pig."</p>
<p>Friends who don't want to be "pigs," after reading this cartoon of "skinning the pig," should take it as a warning!</p>
<h3>Silent Night</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Since I moved from Pushi Road to Malserti Road, the environment has been much quieter than before. There are no more cries of vendors at night, and no more noisy vehicles. I can go to sleep early without worrying about insomnia.</p>
<p>This should be very beneficial to my spirit, but on one night, I had a terrible dream - I dreamed that I was sinking in a gloomy hell - I woke up from the dream in shock, my heart was jumping in lingering fear, I opened my eyes to boundless darkness, and I pricked up my ears to infinite silence. I wanted to find a bit of light or a bit of sound to comfort me and prove that I was not in hell but still living in the world. But the result disappointed me: I couldn't see anything in the dark, and I couldn't hear anything in the silence, not even the sound of the clock on my desk!</p>
<p>When my soul was trapped in the dead silent night and the bewildered illusion - when I suspected that I was a "dead living person" or a "living dead person", suddenly a burst of rapid car bell came from afar. This was the bell of the fire truck. This loud bell immediately broke the frozen silent night, and also broke the deathly silence on my heart.</p>
<h3>Such is the State of Our Nation, Opening Paragraph</h3>
<p>— (Bibo)</p>
<p>In times of turmoil, writing is worthless, and keeping one's mouth shut is even more pitiful. How dare we think of the broken golden goblet on this dying day? How can we bear to proclaim the wheat and millet sorrows? (What is there to say?) Justice still exists in the international community, but don't you see that powerful thugs always take advantage? The god of war is active and peace is gone, and the crisis of bloodshed is currently at hand. New weapons in the sea, land, and air, scientific struggles are like immortals. Where is there a clean land to look at? It is inevitable that war will break out everywhere. (They) fight each other without knowing who will win, (we) are like fish on a chopping board, difficult to keep ourselves safe. Moreover, there is a wolf of a neighbor pressing on the border, the troubles of the nation are heavy and hard to bear. (We should) unite our spirits to resist foreign insults, and work together to save the country with unwavering determination. Treating life lightly and being passive is not courage, but defending the country with weapons is following the example of the ancients. (Who would have thought that) the officials stay indoors like swallows, and leisurely enter and leave dance halls? Enchanting music fills their ears, and rows of naked women compete in beauty. They sing and dance with unlimited joy, hugging beauties shoulder to shoulder. The charming scenery makes them hate the night for being short, and they waltz in pairs, their shadows dancing. They interpret "modern" in this way, indulging in extravagance and being in a state of drunken stupor. Their great ambitions are worn away, and they are extremely decadent. It is a pity to waste such good youth. (It's true that) luxury has become a habit, and their souls are dull, unaffected by the storms outside. The singing girls do not know the hatred of a fallen nation, and they are still lingering in this state of affairs. (May our compatriots) quickly wake up from their spring dream when the rooster crows, and not be like a sleeping lion all day long. (May the authorities) punish traitors and eliminate villains with determination, and swear to persevere with unwavering military might. (Especially) the four virtues and a new life should be promoted together without delay. The survival of the nation depends on this. Quickly take up the whip of Zu Sheng to strive for strength. (Only then can we recover) the beautiful and splendid land of our nation.</p>

<h3>"Cannot Sleep"</h3>
<p>— Yao Xing Shu</p>
<p>——The one who tied the bell must untie it; mental illness requires mental medicine——</p>
<p>To make it clear, "cannot sleep" means unable to fall asleep, or more directly, insomnia.</p>
<p>I don't know whether the word "insomnia" originated in China or came from the East; I don't have any reference books at hand to check. But the phenomenon of being unable to fall asleep has certainly existed since ancient times. The Guan Ju chapter of the Book of Songs says: "...The fair maiden, he seeks her waking and sleeping; he seeks her but finds her not, he thinks of her waking and sleeping; long, long he sighs, tossing and turning on his side..." Thousands of years ago, a man pursued a woman, but his unrequited love was unsuccessful. He lost his love and developed insomnia. Li Lu reported to Su Wu in his letter: "...The grass outside the frontier withers, and I cannot sleep at night..." At that time, General Li, imprisoned in the northern desert, was worried about his homeland and his own fate, and developed insomnia. A Tang poem says: "...The spring scenery is so lovely that I cannot sleep..." This poet probably saw the flourishing of all kinds of flowers in spring, the slender willows swaying green, the apricot blossoms warm with smoke, the butterflies fluttering, the birds chirping, and the scenery beautiful. But he couldn't find a woman to express his secret feelings to, so he developed insomnia because of sexual frustration. I am not well-read enough to give many examples, but judging from these, we can know that insomnia is not necessarily a modern product or a crystallization of civilization. Our ancestors had this problem long ago.</p>
<p>We need to sleep just as urgently as we need food. As the saying goes, "We seek three meals a day, and one night's rest." "One night's rest" means being able to sleep. There is also a German proverb: "A sound sleep is equivalent to half a day's food." Regardless of whether the face is yellow or white, and regardless of whether the eyes are black or green, the importance of sleep is universally recognized.</p>
<p>In fact, if we can fall asleep as soon as we go to bed, have a dream of Nanke, and wake up at the crowing of the morning rooster, yesterday's fatigue can be restored. The taste of sweet sleep is eternal, and the mind is broad and happy. The pleasure and comfort cannot be described in words. On the other hand, if we toss and turn in bed, it is difficult to close our eyes, thoughts arise, and worldly concerns spring up. We hear the ticking of the clock on the wall, and hear others snoring like thunder, both hating and envying. The next day, we are mentally exhausted and physically tired, our minds are upset, and we are depressed, to name just a few. Hygienists have said: "Sound sleep, nourishing food, fresh air, and moderate exercise are all essential elements for human health." These are golden words. Alas, these words are well said! Sleep is extremely important to our health; how can we ignore it?</p>
<p>Insomnia can also be divided into three types: Secondary insomnia, which occurs when other diseases are present. For example, persistent pain, severe cough, frequent diarrhea... can all prevent people from lying down and sleeping soundly at night, but when these diseases disappear, sleep can return to normal. Temporary insomnia is mostly caused by temporary changes in daily life. For example, on the wedding night, with the fair maiden by your side, it is not easy to fall asleep that night. Resting in an inn, with noise and disturbances, is also not easy to sleep. There are also people who cannot sleep when they change beds. In general, various temporary nerve stimuli, worries, and concerns can make people temporarily lose their normal state and not get a good night's sleep; but after the life returns to its original state or after getting used to it, it can be restored. Continuous insomnia can be said to be the chain and extension of temporary insomnia. Ordinary insomnia refers to this, and its duration can be months or years, causing extreme distress to the patient.</p>
<p>In today's society, according to clinical experience, there are really many people who suffer from insomnia. This is not an exaggerated estimate, and it can be interestingly compared to the number of unemployed people in modern times. If our ancestors who suffered from insomnia knew in the afterlife and saw so many virtuous descendants, who are able to develop the hidden light of potential virtue and carry on their legacy, they would probably laugh so hard that their chins would fall off.</p>
<p>Why do so many people in modern times suffer from insomnia? This is actually a great achievement of civilized progress. People who suffer from insomnia are all neurasthenic. This is an extremely common disease in modern times. In civilized countries and prosperous cities, patients of this kind are everywhere. Material things are progressing every day, and careers need to compete every moment. A hundred worries weigh on the heart, and ten thousand things exhaust the body, which can make you neurasthenic and unable to sleep. Singing and dancing halls, long nights of revelry, dissolute customs, indulging in pleasure, mental overwork, and emotional excitement can make you neurasthenic and unable to sleep. Poor friends, worried about clothes and food, are frustrated and lament their poverty, unable to sleep. In short, in the modern environment, there are many factors that stimulate people's nerves, too many to enumerate.</p>
<p>The state of insomnia varies from person to person. Some people have no sleepiness when they lie down. Although they are mentally exhausted, it is difficult to fall asleep. Some cannot close their eyes all night. Some are disturbed by nightmares all night. Some can fall asleep, but wake up after two or three hours and cannot fall asleep again. Some are in a trance, do not snore, and are not aware that they are asleep. Some wake up several times a night. In various forms and colors, each is as different as their faces, and they are not consistent.</p>
<p>The result of insomnia is a feeling of extreme fatigue, a bad mood, laziness in work, and a lack of interest. Then there is dizziness, indigestion, and discomfort in the east and west. The suffering is difficult for those who have not experienced it to fully understand.</p>
<p>At one point, I suffered from insomnia for more than a month because of something (not a failed pursuit, nor a loss in speculation). Readers may think that I am a doctor, so treating myself should be easy, right? Indeed, I was not confused at that time, and I tried all kinds of sleeping pills. "No electricity" and "no effect" were the successful results of the experiments. This is probably because the mental illness is not gone, and the medicine is difficult to work.</p>
<p>In the end, I lost my temper and thought, "What the heck, I'm not afraid of death, am I afraid of not being able to sleep?" "Insomnia," "insomnia," I no longer paid attention to it. On the one hand, I saw the thing I was concerned about clearly and confusedly. Thinking forward and thinking backward, people are always going to die. Isn't everything just a blank when they die? I will do my best to do my things on the day I live, not pessimistic, not optimistic, with some positivity in negativity, and some negativity in positivity. Strangely enough, with this belief, "insomnia" was cured unknowingly. It is true that "the one who tied the bell must untie it; mental illness requires mental medicine."</p>
<p>Finally, I copied the words of Qiaoxia Ke as the conclusion of this article: "Respectfully tell the doctors, when you encounter people with insomnia, you should give them sleeping pills until all kinds of sleeping pills no longer work. This is simply a way to bankrupt science." I myself have committed this. "Respectfully tell the patients, when the doctor cannot know the cause of insomnia, it is best not to pay attention to this insomnia; if you don't pay attention, the insomnia may be cured for no reason." This is my own experience. Insomnia comrades, please pay attention to it!</p>
<h3>World View of Tuberculosis Statistics (3)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang (3)</p>
<p>The number of tuberculosis deaths in France is also relatively high in comparison. However, the national survey of causes of death and the reports from physicians are not entirely reliable. In 1926, the cause of death was unknown in 21.4% of the cases. In large cities like Marseille, the cause of death was unknown in 50% of the cases. Therefore, the percentage of tuberculosis deaths among these is questionable. However, in reality, the number of deaths has indeed decreased, and the number of deaths in large cities is lower than in rural areas. This is due to the influence of improved personal hygiene, as well as the direct protection methods of tuberculosis prevention efforts and the improvements in treatment methods by doctors. The current "treatment network" for tuberculosis prevention in France is very well-organized, but its success is not entirely satisfactory. Generally speaking, France maintains the highest peak in tuberculosis deaths among European countries.</p>
<p>Regarding the success of tuberculosis protection and prevention work, according to the research of Mr. Amsler, in fifty families where direct tuberculosis transmission had occurred among family members, 110 out of 184 descendants died from tuberculosis, with 84 of them dying before the age of three. On the other hand, in these fifty tuberculosis families, 173 young children were provided with preventive care by protection centers. Within a period of two to eight years, only six of them died from tuberculosis, and three of them died within two years.</p>
<p>In Madagascar, a French territory, tuberculosis deaths accounted for one-seventh of all deaths in 1927. There was no significant difference between the indigenous people and other races. Tuberculosis prevention efforts were far from adequate. Similar phenomena were observed in Morocco, Algeria, and the Sahara regions. It is noteworthy that the death rates before the war were not very high, but they gradually increased after leaving and returning.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death rate in Belgium is quite stable. According to Mr. Oldrechts' statistics, in 1925, there were 7.2 cases per 10,000 people, with 6.8 cases among women. In 1929, there were fewer than 7 cases per 10,000 people. Before 1887, tuberculosis deaths among women were very high, but they have gradually decreased since then. Since 1903, the death rate in rural areas has been lower than in cities.</p>
<p>The health situation in the Belgian Congo is worth noting. The region is very dangerous regarding tuberculosis, and self-healing often worsens and becomes acute. Tuberculosis in the area is mostly brought by Arabs, Indians, and black tribes. Currently, regulations are in place that prevent individuals with active tuberculosis from entering. Residents have an obligation to report cases, and all patients must receive appropriate treatment. Observations in 1928 showed that the total number of cases had decreased, but the total number of tuberculosis infections among residents was estimated to be between 6% and 10%.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death rate in Switzerland has not decreased significantly compared to its total death rate. It is also higher than other European countries such as Austria, Hungary, Ireland, and Finland. The age of death is mostly during childhood. Public reports of tuberculosis deaths in large cities show that those affected are often young adults in their prime, and the number of deaths is also very high. In reality, there is no significant difference in tuberculosis deaths between Swiss cities and rural areas, as hygiene improvements in cities are more advanced than in rural areas. Through tuberculosis prevention efforts and the establishment of sanatoriums, patients have been able to extend their lives. The serious question is whether the route of tuberculosis transmission is increasing or decreasing. Because Swiss citizens have no reporting obligations and housing cannot be fully isolated, achieving the goal of reducing tuberculosis transmission seems difficult. Currently, various Swiss cantons are engaged in tuberculosis prevention progress.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death rates in Southern European countries such as Romania and Greece are high. Unsound tuberculosis prevention organizations and difficult economic sources are essential matters that must be overcome in order to achieve success in tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<p>The sanitary conditions on the Hungarian plains are also very poor, due to the hot summers, strong and dusty winter winds, and the difficult construction of houses. Tuberculosis in that country can be called a residential disease.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death rate in Northern Europe is relatively stable, as in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Mr. Neander reports that the tuberculosis death rate in the North Bothnia region of Sweden has decreased by 28%. The tuberculosis death rate in Norway has also been decreasing year by year. In 1929, there were still 15.6 deaths per 10,000 residents, ranking it eleventh among civilized countries in comparison. However, the decrease in deaths has the same trend between genders and among the old and young. Mr. Dahl believes that the harmless immunity caused by the transmission of bovine tuberculosis bacteria through the intestines in childhood has a great impact on the reduction of tuberculosis deaths. Most interestingly, Mr. Heimbeck of Norway tested the tuberculin reaction and found that 99% of urban residents were infected with tuberculosis by the age of 30, while rural residents were delayed until around the age of 40. Mr. Eitrnann believes that improvements in people's living and economic conditions have no great relationship with the decrease in tuberculosis deaths. The most important thing is to prevent the spread and transmission of tuberculosis. Therefore, the popularization of insurance organizations, the dissemination of hygiene knowledge, and the protection of public health are very important measures for tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death rate in Denmark is very stable. According to statistics from 1928, there were 6.3 cases per 10,000 people in cities and 7.5 deaths per 10,000 people throughout the country. Therefore, there is no difference in the degree of tuberculosis infection between urban and rural residents. In experiments with 2,000 rural residents, only 59% had a positive tuberculin reaction, but after living in large cities for several years, the results mostly became positive reactions. Therefore, Denmark is very secure regarding tuberculosis prevention work. On average, there are 131 hospital beds available for every 100 tuberculosis deaths.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death rate in northern and southern Greenland is very high, due to poor housing and early tuberculosis transmission. 13% to 17% of the residents throughout the territory suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, so improving economic conditions and housing problems is very important.</p>
<p>In Eastern European countries such as Poland, Estonia, and Latvia, the announced tuberculosis death rates are also very high, and there has been no downward trend to date. For example, in Latvia in 1925, the tuberculosis death rate was 28.7 cases per 10,000 people. In Estonia, from 1923 to 1928, the average was 23.5% per 10,000 people. The death rate in southwestern Poland is also similar. Tuberculosis prevention efforts in the three countries can be described as having no results.</p>
<p>The statistics for the entire Russian territory are very inconsistent. Physician reports on causes of death have been more reliable since 1925. Mr. Feinshmidt collected these statistical materials, but their scope was limited to urban areas. During the World War, the death rate was similar to other warring countries, but due to post-war revolutions, wars, and the prevalence of famine and disease, tuberculosis deaths remained high until 1922. In 1923, the peak of tuberculosis deaths began to decline. The average rates in the four major cities were 33.5 cases in 1922 (all statistics per 10,000 people), 19.02 cases in 1923, and 13.45 cases in 1927. Mr. Fang believes that the improvement in this statistical trend is due to the progress of public health. Another reason is that patients who contracted tuberculosis during the war have gradually died out.</p>
<p>Currently, the tuberculosis death rate among the Russian ethnicity is higher than other ethnicities within the Soviet Union, such as the Kirgisen, Tartaren, and Burjaden, because their living conditions are not very comfortable. Also, the tuberculosis death rate is high in southern Russia, such as the Caucasus region, because patients often do not go to sanatoriums for treatment, so transmission is very dangerous. In eastern Siberia, the climate is better, with fewer clouds and more sunshine, so there are fewer cases of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Regarding tuberculosis statistics in North America, Mr. Sweany proves that the peak of deaths is closely related to the density of residence. Therefore, the main point of tuberculosis prevention work is to pay attention to location and capacity, and to find ways to improve the public health of residents. Mr. Alen Krause believes that the spread of tuberculosis in the United States is due to economic development. The increase in tuberculosis patients is directly proportional to the development of industry, until 1890. Since then, tuberculosis deaths have decreased year by year, due to the announcement of public health regulations and effective implementation methods. Mr. Shenard believes that although there are many reasons for the decrease in tuberculosis deaths, they can be roughly divided into public health facilities and medical progress. Mr. Gilderg's report is as follows:</p>
<p>1904 20.1 deaths (per 10,000 residents)</p>
<p>1931 6.7 deaths (per 10,000 residents)</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century, the United States had the highest tuberculosis death rate among all deaths, but today it has fallen to sixth place. In recent times of economic panic, the degree of decrease in tuberculosis deaths has also tended to stop, or even slightly increase. This trend of increasing or decreasing deaths is also related to people of color.</p>
<h3>Common Sense About Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(83) What is a Cataract (Continued)</p>
<p>Types of Cataracts: Types of cataracts are distinguished by the cause and timing of onset, the location and shape of the opacity, and the presence or absence of a nucleus. Common congenital cataracts are mostly limited to the center and both poles. Therefore, in medicine, they are specifically divided into anterior polar cataracts, posterior polar cataracts, central cataracts, fusiform cataracts, and punctate cataracts, among other types. Their progression is mostly static. As for acquired cataracts, they are mostly progressive. Their types have been described in detail in the cause section of the previous issue. The most common type is senile cataract. Its progression can be divided into four stages according to the progression of the opacity: incipient cataract, immature cataract, mature cataract, and hypermature cataract. The conditions of the four stages are different.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Cataracts: The main subjective symptom of cataracts is visual impairment. The severity of the impairment varies depending on the degree and location of the opacity of the lens. If there are punctate opacities within the pupillary area, patients often complain of floaters. If the opacity is in the periphery of the lens, they complain of night blindness. This is because the pupil dilates at night or in places with insufficient light, leading to visual impairment. If the opacity is in the center of the lens, they complain of glare blindness. This is because the light is strong during the day and the pupil constricts, leading to visual impairment. As for objective symptoms, grayish-white opacities can be observed when there are opacities within the pupillary area. These opacities appear grayish-white or brownish when examined using oblique illumination. They appear black when examined using retroillumination. The shape, extent, and density of the opacity vary depending on the type of cataract.</p>
<p>The treatment of this disease requires surgery to be effective. It is difficult to cure with medication.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(23) Cocklebur (Cang Er) Xanthium strumarium, L.</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows wild in fields. An annual herb. Stems are 1–1.5 feet tall, densely covered with stiff hairs throughout. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, triangular heart-shaped, serrated, apex acute, often 3–5 lobed. Green unisexual flowers bloom in summer, with male flowers at the apex and female flowers densely clustered at the base. The fruit is small and thin, broadly ovate, with hooked spines.</p>
<p>(Raw Drug) Cocklebur Fruit (Cang Er Zi) is collected from its fruits. This product is broadly ovate, with two beaks at the apex, only 10–12 mm long. The surface is grayish-yellow or gray, densely covered with hooked spines. The taste is slightly bitter.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) It is only known that one ingredient in the fruit is a yellow, amorphous glycoside substance, Xanthastrumarin, whose properties are unknown.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Old sayings: Cocklebur fruit has the effect of relieving fever and promoting perspiration, and can also treat headaches. A single dose is 8–10 fen, used in decoctions. It is also said that the stems and leaves, when rubbed soft, are effective for applying to scabies, pimples, and insect bites. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A About Dental Knowledge (26)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 127) What is the value of tooth powder and toothpaste?</p>
<p>Answer: Tooth powder and toothpaste can be used as aids to cleaning the oral cavity when brushing teeth. They are not necessarily needed by healthy, normal people who brush their teeth diligently. However, good tooth powder and toothpaste do have many benefits, increasing the friction of brushing, reducing bacteria in the oral cavity, and neutralizing acidity in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>(Question 128) How should tooth powder and toothpaste be selected? Answer: Coarse tooth powder is harmful to tooth enamel and should not be purchased. The best tooth powder is mostly made with precipitated calcium carbonate, plus some soap powder, peppermint oil, etc. It is extremely fine and does not harm teeth. If commercially available tooth powder feels fine and is made by a reputable manufacturer, it is probably usable. As for toothpaste, it is actually the same as tooth powder, but with the addition of some glycerin and colloid to make it a paste.</p>
<p>(Question 129) In addition to brushing, what other methods can be used frequently to clean the oral cavity? Answer: Mouthwash can be used for rinsing. It is even more advisable for people with unclean oral cavities, unhealthy teeth, or those prone to oral inflammation to use it frequently.</p>
<p>(Question 130) What conditions should a good mouthwash have? Answer: It should have antiseptic and disinfectant properties, while not being too irritating to soft tissues, causing them damage. It should not disrupt the fermentation function of saliva. It should be non-toxic, so it is harmless even if swallowed.</p>
<p>(Question 131) Can mouthwash completely disinfect the oral cavity? Answer: Although mouthwash has antiseptic and disinfectant properties, it definitely cannot completely disinfect the oral cavity and make it sterile. However, it can prevent the proliferation of bacteria and reduce the number of bacteria. If harsh bactericidal drugs are added to enhance the disinfecting effect, it is not only useless but also harmful.</p>
<h3>Brief Introduction to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (86)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 8: Surgical Treatment</p>
<p>In addition to artificial pneumothorax, there are also thoracoplasty, phrenic nerve resection, and plombage. These are all within the scope of surgical treatment. Although their implementation is not as widespread as artificial pneumothorax, they can sometimes compensate for the inadequacies of artificial pneumothorax surgery. The general situation regarding them will now be described separately below:</p>
<p>Thoracoplasty: This involves the removal of ribs on both sides of the thoracic spine. Its purpose is to reduce the internal cavity of the chest and compress the lung tissue. This type of surgery is more complex than others, so it is not very suitable for patients who are physically weak. However, for patients with pleural adhesions who cannot undergo artificial pneumothorax, it can completely compensate for this defect. This is the most important indication. In addition, it is worth trying for those whose disease is still progressing after artificial pneumothorax, those who cannot afford long-term artificial pneumothorax treatment due to economic conditions, and those who have developed empyema and artificial pneumothorax complications. According to Mr. Sauerbruch's report, approximately 40% can turn the tide. The contraindications are generally the same as for artificial pneumothorax surgery.</p>
<p>Phrenic Nerve Resection: The phrenic nerve is one of the nerves that controls respiratory movement. If this nerve is cut, the diaphragm will be paralyzed, resulting in upward compression of the lungs. The purpose is the same as artificial pneumothorax, but the approach is different. It has a particularly good effect on lesions located in the lower lobes. If the disease is bilateral and artificial pneumothorax and thoracoplasty cannot be performed, it can also compensate for this defect. In addition, performing this surgery before artificial pneumothorax and thoracoplasty can further enhance the compression of the lungs, which is also helpful in promoting the scarring of lesions.</p>
<p>Plombage: This type of surgery is entirely for dealing with cavities. It involves open surgery, filling the cavity with paraffin according to the size of the lesion cavity, so that the cavity is compressed, to achieve the purpose of treatment. The indications are: the lesion is limited to the apex of the lung, ulcerated into a cavity state; the pleural layers are adhered, artificial pneumothorax surgery cannot be performed, and thoracoplasty cannot be performed for bilateral disease, which is the most suitable. According to reports from some experts, the results of the process are often good. It's just that there are not many pure cases like this! (End of this chapter)</p>

<h3>Political Trickery</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>Because people are constantly striving to improve, they are always working to enhance their lives. When life is progressing smoothly, people no longer experience significant frustrations and instead focus wholeheartedly on their work. However, when their lives encounter obstacles, they need to improve them. At this time, any action that raises their hope for improving their lives, whether it is a factual behavior or an empty stimulus, will be warmly welcomed and supported. Therefore, political figures, if they want to solidify their ruling position, have two methods: one is to concretely improve the lives of the social masses with factual behaviors, in exchange for people's wholehearted efforts to move forward; the other is to deceive and numb or drive people to madness with temporary empty stimuli. The former can develop into a lasting fact; the latter must constantly change its methods to deceive people with short-term stimuli. The content of so-called political strategy is really nothing more than the application of these two principles.</p>
<p>The saying "If you cannot give the people bread, then you must give them glory" means this. Giving the people bread can be called a factual behavior; while merely giving the people glory can be called an empty stimulus. Every empty stimulus is, in fact, difficult to maintain for long. At least a few months, at most a year, when its effect is no longer valid, the peep show has been seen through, and people no longer believe it. At this time, another trick must be played to give people new stimuli. Although the core is still that old trick, at least the outside has been put on a new coat, and it can deceive people's fantasies for a certain period of time. In this way, new tricks emerge endlessly, and people are constantly deceived, but the purpose of the political strategy has been achieved. In fact, such examples are truly everywhere at present. After a series of stimulating actions by German politicians, such as withdrawing from the League of Nations, attacking Jews, and rearming, there is now the action of sending troops to the Rhineland region, followed by holding elections. Before the elections, a large-scale demonstration was held for two days. The leader, Hitler, broadcast a speech to the nation from the Krupp arms factory. Before the speech, all traffic except trains and airplanes was stopped for one minute. People had to gather in the streets to respectfully listen to the leader's speech. All the people had to express the excitement of Germany regaining freedom and equality. The telegram was very simple, but a lively situation jumped off the page. If we could personally go to Germany, we would definitely see many disciples and grandchildren of Mr. Xi diligently arranging this "excitement." The real people are like a group of children, their cries drowned out by the deafening sound of gongs and drums being beaten. Indeed, it seems like we are watching a play at this moment.</p>
<h3>Fallen People</h3>
<p>— Family</p>
<p>"Who would have thought this family would fall to such a state today." Older folks probably still vaguely remember:</p>
<p>"Second Madam, you are truly blessed,"</p>
<p>The man happened to be second-born, and people of lower status or those in the underworld would respectfully address women this way. The same extremely ordinary form of address, if you turned back the clock twenty years, at that time, almost everyone used a very respectful tone to call her this, and savored it with the greatest envy. But now, although people still habitually call her that, they do so lazily, as if unwilling to apply these two words to someone not worthy of the title, even containing a considerable hint of contempt. At that time, Second Madam's maternal and paternal families were both extremely prominent officials in the imperial court, and Second Madam was the most favored, so she appeared all the more noble. At that time, Second Madam, she hid year-round in the deep recesses of the house, treasured like an antique, and would never take a step outside the door herself, except to watch the festivities in town on good days, surrounded by maids and servants. It was not easy to see her...</p>
<p>Since both families of in-laws died one after another, followed by Second Madam's husband not long after, although the man died, the property he left behind was substantial enough to live off for a lifetime. Second Madam had a total of four sons, and the family had plenty of money, so they all fell into idleness, only knowing how to squander it, doing nothing. Second Madam herself was meek by nature, used to eating, using, and enjoying pleasures, and she didn't pay much attention to or feel sorry for her sons' debt-like spending. Even she herself had quite the talent for wasting money: every day she was idle and had nothing to do, and even without any holidays or festivals, she would always buy expensive things in large and small baskets for cooking and eating. In such a situation where there was only outflow and no inflow, within a few years, the fortune was completely depleted...</p>
<p>By this time, the sons understood that there was no more oil to squeeze out of the family, and they had no choice but to scatter and go out to find their own livelihoods.</p>
<p>The huge mansion, a complex of six independent houses connected together, was only inhabited by the eldest daughter-in-law, the eldest grandson, and Second Madam herself. However, Second Madam seemed perfectly content with the worsening situation, showing no regret or sorrow for the past. Her love of eating remained unchanged, and finally, she turned her attention to forcing up the rent. At first, she leased out the empty houses to others, and then leased them out one by one until only one house remained for herself to live in. Waiting for the lease to expire, unable to redeem them, she sold even the land outright. In a very short time, the mansion was no longer hers, and she went from being the owner to being a guest. She even had to pay rent to others. After a while, she had no choice but to move to a shanty town.</p>
<p>— No better than a cheap prostitute who has brought shame to her ancestors and her clan. She has literally eaten the house into her stomach.</p>
<p>Causing people in the village to mock or scold her. Second Madam didn't care at all, just doing her own thing. She had a stubborn streak, doing what she wanted and taking responsibility for it herself, without a single complaint.</p>
<p>Now, Second Madam has been living in the shanty town for a long time. The three of them live day by day buying three coppers' worth of oil, five coppers' worth of coal, and two liters of rice in small quantities.</p>
<p>"Serves her right, that kind of person will come to no good end, she brought it on herself." People only have curses and no sympathy when they see her like this, and Second Madam also seems to have no need for people's sympathy. She is strangely lonely. But when someone wants to chat with her, she will leisurely say:</p>
<p>"It's not bad to experience a little hardship after having tasted all the pleasures in life."</p>
<h3>In a Dark Corner</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>When I went to Macau for the second time, it was right after I had run away from home. I didn't have much money, so I stayed in a dark little hotel, waiting for news from my cousin and starting to look for work.</p>
<p>But I didn't know anything, I was actually still a child! So, I began to wander anxiously in the noisy streets. From the morning, when the lively sounds of the street poured into my dark little room, I quietly left this home for vagrants, running in the streets, until late at night, when the streets were hung with neon-like lights, and pairs of Southern girls, dressed so attractively, blossomed like flowers, filling the streets and alleys of Macau. I was just like someone who had been kidnapped, dragging my tired legs, returning to the dark corner amidst the blaring string music. - I lived this bleak life for more than ten days. Gradually, I became bored, as if immersed in dull alcohol. I almost hated Macau, hated that sinful place.</p>
<p>I still hadn't found a job, because I didn't have any relatives or friends. This place was completely unfamiliar. The long streets had no place for me to stay, no one to talk to about the things in my heart. As for my young cousin? She was still hiding in the countryside. She had said that she could introduce me to work in a pharmacy. The pharmacy was opened by the father of her old classmate, Miss Liu. She might still be in Macau. But I waited for many days, and she still hadn't replied. In the past, I not only found the completely unfamiliar pharmacy life to be annoying, but now even the hope of being a shop assistant was gone. So, I couldn't help but sigh: "I should leave this place!" But where to go? Everywhere is the same dark world!</p>
<p>In my wandering life, I gradually felt panic about life. I didn't even take a step out the door, hiding in that dark room all day, sometimes reading novels, sometimes leaning against the bed with a frown, lost in thought. During this time, the old clerk often came in to chat with me. He was probably in his forties or fifties, short in stature, with a long face, already showing some wrinkles, thin and sparse hair, and a pair of alert eyes. He seemed to be observing like a cat. He didn't seem to have much work, perhaps because there were few travelers, so he tirelessly came to talk to me.</p>
<p>"Why are you so depressed? Come out and take a walk with me!"</p>
<p>He grinned with an experienced smile and mouth, twisting my hand.</p>
<p>"What's the use? Everywhere is the same, there's no purpose!"</p>
<p>"Then, let's gamble on Fan-Tan. If we win money, let's have fun!"</p>
<p>I was not interested in gambling, and I refused.</p>
<p>"Then, let's go to the flower district. Someone as young as you should... I can introduce you to a girl, what a good girl, so beautiful and clean, and so kind. That girl will guarantee you satisfaction. Maybe, if you give her one night's silver, if she's happy, she won't want your money for a long time..."</p>
<p>He gossiped like a matchmaker, tempting me with lewd gestures.</p>
<p>"If you don't want that, I can introduce you to a virgin, that's even cleaner, and money is even less of a problem. A woman like that will be attracted to someone young like you."</p>
<p>My heart became even more troubled. I glared at his face, but my mind was filled with thoughts of my way out, my job, my cousin's letter! Not only was I not in the mood to go out with him, but the more I looked at him, the more terrifying he seemed. He seemed to want me to follow that path with him, stubbornly.</p>
<p>"There's no need to be afraid. I've been in Macau for twenty years, I know everything. If you're afraid of getting sick, take some medicine. I'll tell you the prescription later! Really, there's no need to be afraid! When I was young, that disease made all my hair fall out. But it can always be cured, I have many methods!"</p>
<p>I didn't go out with him, I wanted to write another letter to my cousin. He asked me where my cousin was from. I told him, and he jumped up and patted my arm:</p>
<p>"Great! I have a friend who is a smuggler, and I'm also from Doumen. I can introduce your letter to him to take there. In two days, you'll have a reply! Do you want her to send you money?"</p>
<p>I was extremely happy because someone was taking a letter to my cousin, so I went out with him.</p>
<p>The old guy wanted me to pay him a dollar as a reward and said a lot of things:</p>
<p>"If she sends you money, I'll definitely take you to have fun in a good place. Do you want to live in Macau for a long time? I can introduce you to join our group. We'll help each other. Our gang has power in Macau."</p>
<p>He smiled, encouraging me. I thought, "In this dark corner, am I also going to take that path?"</p>
<p>I left the dark corner in disappointment.</p>
<h3>Bees</h3>
<p>— Blackbird</p>
<p>This should be a joke: On a Sunday after six days of anticipation, when my friend Ru came to my residence, we sat silently facing each other under the south window for a long time, but couldn't think of where to spend this anticipated day. It is said that humans can be divided into many kinds, but we don't know which category we should belong to. When six days of work erode our limited flesh and blood, we often count the fingers like children to calculate an anticipated day, but with the arrival of each Sunday, we are like being expelled from this world, and this anticipated day gives us even greater pain in contrast.</p>
<p>The aperture of spring is short. Sitting silently, sitting silently, the sun gradually moves towards the east wall. I quite like this quiet courtyard. The landlord is a beekeeping expert, and the beehives are made under my south window. The sun is</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>covering this small courtyard, swarms of bees flying back and forth on the wall. When hundreds of flowers bloom in spring, it is their time to make honey. I remember this small animal was taken as a fable in textbooks to encourage people to be as diligent as them to prevent unforeseen circumstances. But when they make honey tirelessly every day, covering the wax cells in the hive with fragrant honey, their master only needs a little effort to obtain the price of their hard work for several months. Although this small animal unknowingly enjoys a portion of the food left behind, it still does its work when flowers bloom and wither, but upstairs lives a human being who shares the same fate as them. I often sit silently under the south window like this, facing the courtyard, but what I see is another world - no beehives, no bees, not even this courtyard. I am searching for the kind I should belong to among the many kinds of humans, but this kind has never been discovered by me. When those bees flying back and forth on the wall return to my sight, I seem to realize that I may also be the same kind as the bees! So I sympathize with this small animal, and from this small animal, I like this courtyard. We should use collective strength to take back what has been taken away!</p>
<p>The sun quickly threw off the corner of the wall, and this world is already under the wings of the god of night. We seem to drag our tired bodies to eat our dinner as if we have finished a day's work, and eating seems to fulfill our obligation to send off this anticipated Sunday.</p>
<p>After my friend left, the house seemed even more lonely, and the buzzing of the bees seemed to be especially amplified and echoing in my ears. What do they want to tell me, or do they understand my meaning? I looked out the window, it was pitch black, there was nothing.</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Blow)</p>
<p>Hitler's opinion on the Locarno Pact is that the demilitarized zone on the German border does not conform to the principle of mutual equality. After foreign troops are stationed in Germany, the German public does not understand the purpose of it. It should be known that our demand for equality will never be compromised in the slightest. Tan Lao San said, this kind of medicine can only be given to ordinary weak nations to eat, so that it fits the taste. If it is given to Hitler to eat, I am afraid there is no hope.</p>
<p>The US Pacific Fleet is mobilized to conduct large-scale exercises, and the destination is kept strictly secret. Tan Lao San said, this is the best posture of the United States, but their posture is only like this. Is this why the United States is the United States? Broadcast.</p>

<p>Abandoned Village Ancient Temple</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, during the years of warlord melee. A sister-in-law and a maiden took Xue'er and fled from their home because the sister-in-law's feet were small and delicate. After walking a few miles, she really couldn't walk anymore! So seeing an ancient temple, they ran inside to rest. The real thing was too unfortunate. They had just sat down for a moment when they suddenly heard the voices of soldiers outside the temple. At this time, the three of them were in a daze, but fortunately, the maiden reminded them to hide behind the shrine, hoping to escape after the soldiers left.</p>
<p>But the three soldiers had heard the voices of the three women in the temple. How could they let go of this opportunity?</p>
<p>Really, too unlucky. Suddenly Xue'er wanted to urinate and cried out, and of course, the soldiers heard it, so they dragged Xue'er out from behind the shrine. When the sister-in-law saw her own child being captured by the soldiers, she naturally had the instinct of mother and child, and immediately ran out from behind the shrine to protect Xue'er. When the three soldiers saw a woman running out, they were really happy and jumped up. Everyone competed for the sister-in-law among the three men, A, B, and C. At this time, Xue'er helped her mother and bit C, and C picked her up and threw her to death on the ground.</p>
<p>However, how can three people sharing one woman be divided equally? Later, A suggested searching again to see, because they had clearly heard three voices just now, but now there are only two. In this way, the maiden was also searched out from behind the shrine by A. When A, B, and C saw that it was a young lady, it was even more incredible. No one would let anyone else have her. Everyone wanted to play with her first. A stabbed B to death with a knife in order to compete for playing with her first!</p>
<p>But the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. C secretly fired a shot at A, killing him instantly. At that time, there was no one to compete with C for this young lady! But what could he do if the maiden did not obey him? During the conversation between the two, the maiden suddenly discovered that this C was her own brother, the sister-in-law's husband, and Xue'er's father, but Xue'er had already been thrown to death by him personally. When the sister-in-law heard that the person who threw her son to death was her own husband, she realized that she could no longer cooperate with this beastly and cruel husband. Although C was repenting to her, what was the use? She ran out without looking back!</p>

<p>Descendant of Prince Jing of the Han Dynasty in Zhongshan. Emperor Uncle's reputation is known throughout the world. His appearance is extraordinary and his bones are poor. How can his ambition fulfill his life? In the Peach Garden, three brothers became sworn brothers. They prayed to the gods not to betray their alliance. They worked together to eliminate the Yellow Turbans. As a commoner, he was inevitably despised. He was a weaver of mats and a maker of clogs. For his merits, he was granted the official position of Anxi County. He shook his prestige at Hulao Pass. He relied on Yuan Shao and Liu Biao. He was no match for Cao Cao's million troops. He temporarily borrowed Jingzhou to rest his feet. Then the Wu Kingdom sought marriage. The brother-in-law ultimately harbored the heart of an enemy country. After that, he entered Sichuan and became the Shu Han. He unexpectedly established a three-legged situation. The military advisor, Mr. Zhuge, advised the courtiers to submit a memorial. He was a ruler for Cao Pi's claim to the throne. Guan Zhang was killed and Jingxiang was lost. Helplessly, the continuous camp was burned by fire. He entrusted the orphan to the young lord in his illness. Liu Chan was over forty years old. He was made a king of Anle for his whole life. Zhu Fuzi compiled the net. Shu Mo ultimately became the orthodox ruler. I respectfully praise the small court of the Southern Song Dynasty.</p>

<p>Dear readers, China has reached a critical moment of survival. Our general broadcasting industry still has no expression, especially the singing societies, which are still intoxicating the entire youth and the entire nation with songs about love and affection all day long. I, we, are not needed now. We need to sing magnificent and passionate songs about national significance to awaken the long-dormant national spirit, and sing to excite the people of the whole country. Therefore, we have organized a Roaring Singing Society, broadcasting various songs every Saturday from 10:30 AM on the Ministry of Communications Radio Station (1300), and hope that our enthusiastic supporters will give us guidance and criticism. We are grateful for this. Our mailing address is Room 137, Sassoon Building, Bund.</p>

<h3>United Film News</h3>
<p>The Petrified Forest, now showing at Cathay, is a sentimental film with a long performance. It describes a pair of young men and women who meet on a strange road and ignite the fire of love in an extremely dangerous environment. The protagonists Leslie Howard and Bette Davis are all big stars known for their performances, so they perform with extra heat and tension.</p>
<p>The great man on the screen, Paul Muni, has played a thug in "Scarface", a fugitive in "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", a doctor in "Black Fury", a miner in "Juarez", and a reporter in "Hi, Nellie!". Now, he will meet the people of Shanghai in the film The Story of Louis Pasteur. He will play the great man of the scientific community, Louis Pasteur. When it was previewed at the Grand Light Theatre the other day, everyone said that this was Paul Muni's best performance. The film has been scheduled to be screened at the Grand Light Theatre from Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>A Widow From Monte Carlo is Dolores del Río's last work with Warner Bros. It is a page of scandalous history about a noble widow in Monte Carlo. Dolores del Río's depiction of a young woman's need for love is extremely flavorful. It is heard that the film will be released at Cathay after "The Petrified Forest".</p>
<h3>"Night of Revelry"</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Dongshan's New Script After "Song of Everlasting Sorrow"</p>
<p>The third work of Xinhua Company, directed by Shi Dong, "Song of Everlasting Sorrow", not only received unanimous praise from the media, but also broke the record in business. It is by no means accidental to achieve a double victory in both media and business. Now what can be consoled to the readers. Shi Dongshanfu will direct the fifth work of Xinhua Company after "Peach Blossom Spring Dream". The film is titled "Night of Revelry", a comedy, but its effect is not just to make everyone laugh; maybe the audience can't help but laugh heartily, but at that time, the people in the play feel like they want to cry without tears. So this movie is another kind of flavor, infinitely mysterious; with Shi Dongshan's brilliant directing skills, the success of "Night of Revelry" is not a problem?</p>
<p>The script has been approved by the Central Government and is about to start filming. Let us report on the cast of "Night of Revelry" in a few days.</p>
<h3>Yihua's New Film "Father and Son Heroes"</h3>

<h3>Anonymous One's Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Anonymous One sent a statement, but "after reading it for several weeks," I still don't understand Mr. Anonymous One's reason for sending this statement, because Mr. Anonymous One mentioned Silver Miscellany, and "read it several times," so why not declare some "events" that he needs to declare! But "fellow travelers" may know "what" Mr. Anonymous One is declaring, so it is published here. Editor.</p>
<p>I saw the telegram of the 26th on the 27th at Mr. Lin's place. I vaguely saw that it said, "My son went to Mr. Lin at the Datong Apartment on Baylor Road without having breakfast yesterday because of the Silver Miscellany, questioning Mr. Lin why he took down such a rotten mess," so I found the Shen Bao of the 25th and read it. After reading it several times, I still didn't find any place that talked about me.</p>
<p>Although my name was borrowed in the "Spring Flower" of the Star Film Company, I have never been hired as a "designer" or "representative" of the Star Film Company.</p>
<p>I have always maintained a "commercial relationship" in writing for various newspapers.</p>
<p>I have never borrowed anyone's name to write a single word, although my name "Anonymous One" has been borrowed once or twice in "righteousness."</p>
<p>I am not afraid of starting a pen war with anyone, but I often wish to do my best to avoid unnecessary disputes.</p>
