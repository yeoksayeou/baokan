<p>— 星</p>
<p>但澤問題自葛萊塞氏於日內瓦激起巨波後柏林方面戚情驟形緊張日來頗有主張以公民投票方式解决但澤之命運者據哈瓦斯所傳消息柏林之外交界就但澤之現狀發表意見咸謂該區現行制度或當經公民投票加以變更而此舉果獲實現德國可操勝算與去年一月薩爾區域公民投票初無二致卽倫敦方面保守黨議員珊第斯亦主張在但澤自由巿舉行公民投稟藉以决定自由市之前途</p>
<p>夫公民投票本爲凡爾賽和約中用以表示民族自决之最普遍方法如德國丹麥間之邊境糾紛波蘭德國間之上西里西亞問題比利時德國間之界綫奧大利與南斯拉夫及匈牙利間之界錢均藉公民投票以决定疆域之誰屬獨但澤一市以顧全波蘭之利益而不顧當地居民之意志劃爲自由市但澤十七萬人口之中波蘭人僅佔百分之十如凡爾賽和約應用公民自决原則此自由港之歸于德國版圖殆無疑義今國社黨重申此項原則欲以成子薩爾者成之于但澤于理論上不無根據也</p>
<p>雖然公民投票自决果足以根本解决國際糾紛乎事實上頗不易作肯定之解答而就經濟關係觀察此項方法尤不宜應用于但澤蓋但澤者波蘭人之天然海港日耳曼人蕃殖之地域也公民投票之弊論者謂有下列諸端　附近居民侵入糾紛地帶而當地駐軍左袒威脅使一方人民不敢表示意見　中立軍隊亦不免左袒一方如上西里西亞之公民投票英軍袒德法軍袒波　投票之前競作宣傳惡　鼓動雙方更不能相安而决定以後少數人民受壓迫更甚　人民投票往往受一時的利害驅使而未暇考慮將來之永遠福利易貽後悔　或左或右惟有于二端中選擇其一而無表示其他意見之可能從晋從楚皆非其願而眞正意見無由表現　人民分佈至爲複雜得一適當之界綫必犧牲少數之利益而嚴重困難之少數民族問題於焉引起此六者爲公民投票之弱點而不能完全消除者也</p>
<p>抑公民投票之最大困難在于經濟問題政治之利害與經濟之利害往往不能一致就政治而言德國人之但澤應在國社黨旗幟之下就經濟而言但澤歸德之日卽但澤經濟破產之時有人謂一但澤重見祖國之旗已成爲死屍」言雖過甚亦有至理蓋維斯杜拉河者波蘭人之河流也波蘭人如不願以但澤爲其產物之集散地則碼頭堆棧銀行保險公司將寂寥無顧客况華沙及克拉寇等市商務之權大半操于猶太人猶太人願國社黨所統治之但澤繁榮乎知國社黨與猶太人之積恨者皆能解答之故公民自决可解决但澤之政治問題而不能解决但澤之經濟問題圍國際糾紛之永久消弭似尙待更根本之方法也</p>

<p>蒙德婁城　關於蒙德婁會議形勢、各觀察家以爲各關係國對於兩項問題、意見仍屬紛歧、　卽蘇俄所提出之要求、該國所屬艦隊無論在戰時或在平時、均應享有自由通過海峽之權利、　卽蘇俄對於英國案第十六條　（主張黑海在戰時仍應開放）所提出之修正案、要求在戰時封鎖黑海、但各國所屬艦隊若因履行國聯會盟約或區域公約所規定之義務、以對付侵略國時、則當准其自由通過、關於第一項問題、英國代表團已向該國政府請訓、大抵當以「碍難照辦」四字作答、蓋蘇俄駐在黑海艦隊若果許其自由通過海峽、俾與波羅的海艦隊相聯合、則德國旣感不快、而英德兩國海軍協定各項規定、亦且爲所妨害、關於第二項問題、消息靈通人士頃宣稱、英國必可加以贊同、但按之該國專家意見、仍須附帶一項條件、卽士耳其若因履行區域公約、而被攻擊時、英國不必加以援助、並依照國聯會盟約第十五條第七節所載各項規定、而置身事外是也云、（按此節乃謂「如行政院除相爭之一造或一造以上之代表外、不能使該院各會員國一致贊成其報告書、則國聯會各會員國保留權利、施行認爲維持公平與正義之必要行動」）（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— Louis　Fisher作賓符譯</p>
<p>西班牙顯然非設法救濟她的貧窮和落後不可。農民和城市工人要求着較好的生活條件。當反動的右派在位時，除了只以恐怖來答覆他們的要求外，就沒有別的辦法；這樣多數西班牙人更明白那反動者是再沒有力量也沒有資格繼續統治這個國家了。</p>
<p>反動的右派包括大地主·敎會·帝政主義者和幾個大工業家。他們是沒落，畏縮而且散漫的。他們目前主要的希望就是得陸軍和內衛團的援助來一次暴力政變。這種陰謀正足以表明他們的失勢。因此，左派得到了一惆空前未有的機會。一九三六年二月六日，急進派的聯合陣綫終於獲得最後的勝利了。共產黨雖拒絕負行政上的責任，也終於給可柴那領導下的左翼布爾喬亞共和黨的少數內閣以支持和維護。</p>
<p>阿柴那（Manuel　Azana）是有趣味的環境中一惆有趣味的人物。西班牙實在非需要革命來改造她國家經濟不可的。阿柴那卻希望從演進或民主的方法來達到這種革命。社會主義者和共產主義者雖然懷疑地注視着，卻並不收回他們的擁護，這理由有二：阿柴那的傾覆，也許又要回復右派的統治，還有，他們相信阿柴那的所爲，是正在替他們開先路。阿柴那可並不這樣想。他是不願做克倫斯基的。他要替西班牙創造一種新的特別的範疇，旣不與法西斯主義·布爾雪維克主義相合，也不同於已成的資本主義的形式。他曾經對我說：「我要一個帶有某種社會主義改革的極左的共和國」。</p>
<p>阿柴那雖然不是社會主義者，然而他卻口口聲聲對我提到「社會主義的改革」，「集體農業」，以及「土地無代價的收回國有」等。事實是這樣的：許多平常極力反對社會主義者都認爲社會主義在西班牙是不可避免的。國家必需有一惆進步的階級來領導來統治。在西歐各國中，布爾喬亞就是擔任着這種利於自己，利於國家以及甚至多少利於羣衆的任務。但是西班牙卻從來不會發展成一個布爾喬亞。這也許就是她衰落的原因。現在要造成一個西班牙的布爾喬亞，可巳遲了；工農大衆正在奮起進取政權，要從悲慘愁苦之中自拔，使西班牙成爲一個現代的繁榮的國家。</p>
<p>在西班牙二三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇的居民中，有百分之八十是住居於鄉村的、如果再把官吏階級和都市的智識階級加上去，所剩下的工業布爾喬亞就很有限。那裹簡直沒有中等階級的。敎會在帝政之下只是一種帮助籠絡人民於黑暗和愚味中的制度。人民並不眞正信仰宗敎；他們憤恨着敎會，因爲它是他們壓迫者事實上的代言人。這一切很像一九一七年以前俄國的情形，而且對於將來同樣發展的條件也是相合的。</p>
<p>沒有幾天以前，我跑到離塞佛爾（Seville）只有三十分鐘電氣火車路程的普　羅特里俄（Pueblo　del　Rio　）村鎭去。我有二年不到這裏了。農人們立刻把我認了出來。我跑到草紮的泥壁的茅屋中去。天正落着雨，地上積成了水潭。人民都是困苦襤褸的；他們一向吃得非常苦，據他們報告說，「好好壞壞，不曾改變過什麼」。他們都是劇烈地反對敎會的，他們的孩子，沒有一個曾受過洗禮。「敎會是專門爲了迷信者和帝政主義者的」，有一惆人曾這樣說。</p>
<p>這些農人都是家無長物，——除了幾把破椅子，一張不好用作吃飯的桌子，以及幾條當作眠床的粗陋的板凳。他們在大財主那裏當日工，每天規定最少工資五“Peseta”（西班牙幣名）。他們一年平均只有三個月的工作。「最近，在政府强制之下，工作總算多一些了，但是地主卻又不付工資。他們在塞維爾和瑪德里生活着，然而沒有錢。」這種人羣給生活磨折威脅着，以至不敢咒詛財主。我曾經在東方見過Bedouin人。（住居沙漢的阿刺伯人，生活極苦。——譯者）這些西班牙人的生活實在沒有比他們好些。西班牙有數萬人也是這樣生活着，他們住的洞穴，吃的是草根和樹皮。</p>
<p>這自然是人類最劣等最低下的渣滓。可是那“Yunteros”他們是有一對騾子而沒有田地的，卽使有一公頃或二公頃田地的，也並沒有生活得舒適些。我曾經跟二十個這類人談過話。他們都是缺乏營養的。他們三十五歲的女人，看上去約有五十歲。我曾詢問一個有着四個孩子的母親，爲什麼她生了這許多的孩子。她回答說：「他們來了，我寗可一個也沒有」。在西班牙最大的一省卡塞累斯（Caceres）中，有百分之六十一·六的人口是不識字的。別的省區都是它尖銳的敵人。這一切的情形實對統治階級執行了死刑。</p>

<p>積貨二百萬巳開裝</p>
<p>水脚修改在協議中</p>
<p>本月一日、長江六公司，因將上水疋頭洋布、通告實行量尺、並須將水脚漲到每噸（四十尺）十三元六角、滬上疋頭客帮、及長江各報關業、屢次向六公司交涉、未能達到减短運費目的、遂自七月一日起、凡運往長江之疋頭洋布、對六公司輪實施最後辦法、</p>
<p>一致罷運</p>
<p>一面由疋頭業公推報關業公會領袖陳泮君、出興六公司交涉、志在達到寬放尺碼、（照新章、每件祇許十八尺、與原定箱子、相距十二尺之多與减短運費、蓋照新章收水脚、同樣一箱疋頭、運費相差至四元七角之巨、歷經十餘日交涉、尙未得確切解决辦法、以致滬上積堆長江疋頭、有四五千件、紙値二百萬元、最後因兩方各趨堅决、殊非「商」「航」之福、遂由三北公司副理伍德鄰出向各</p>

<p>展期半月</p>
<p>到七月十五日實行、同時六公司可以容納陳泮君等提出意見、將新章運費、准予减短、但已經堆積各棧之大宗疋頭、須先裝運、仍可照原水脚優待、必盡量多運華輪、會湘省前因事停阻之商運、今則已告一段落、紛電滬上催貨、疋頭帮照伍君主張、已從九日起、接受調解辦法、取消罷運、將本星期一起、卽已</p>
<p>開始報裝</p>
<p>扣至今日、至少已可裝出疋頭洋布等二千至三千箱、其中有十分之五、係運往湘省者、餘到九江漢口、太古三北等、因之均開行湖南直航班、趕載疋布上水、而招商局亦决派江靖輪、直航長沙、運載此貨、至於修改新定水脚、由六公司再開會議决定之、然後通知各客家、大致在十五日卽可議决、一塲長江帮疋頭罷運之大風潮、已告一段落、</p>

<p>新閘絲廠聯合罷工</p>
<p>新閘北開工絲廠、計有（光復路）大豐·成豐·（恒豐路）鴻泰·協興·義昌·（長安路）泰倫·復昶二廠、（共和路）積餘·久餘等十三家絲廠、雇用女工約一萬六千餘人、本市絲廠工資、在一二八前每工計洋六角、自一二八後、改為五角一分、前年竟減至每工三角八分、去年因絲市稍見起色、每工增加為四角、本年各絲廠開工後、該區絲工要求恢復每工五角五分、但廠方不堪負擔、致無結果、本月七日下午放飯工後、長安路泰倫絲廠女工首先拒絕入廠工作、發生罷工、旋波及協興絲廠及鴻泰絲廠鄰近各絲廠、深恐罷工、工人前來滋擾、故一致將工作之工人放出、八日晨亦未拉回聲開工、相持到昨日已三天、仍未開工、</p>

<p>當局調解未得結果</p>
<p>當政機關為防範工潮擴大、特於昨日下午二時、由社會局召集勞資雙方到局調解、到六區繅絲工會、袁雲龍楊賡緹、同業公會沈驊臣張佩伸·市黨部代表朱養吾、由社會局調解科朱圭林主席、經詢明情形後、勞方提出恢復每工五角一分、資方祇允每工加四分、為四角四分、並縮短工作一小時、因雙方意見未得接近、致無結果、社會局定星期二、上午九時、再行召集調解工人方面、則仍繼續罷工、</p>

<p>昨日午後二時、第一特區地方法院繼續審究日本水兵中山秀雄被人開槍狙擊殞命一案、審判長錢鴻業與萧燮棻·馮世德·兩推事曁檢察官張崇儒·書記官丁重南·升座第一刑庭、飭將被告楊文道·枼海生·周社榮·提案後、代表捕房起訴之汝葆　律師、卽聲明尙有見證葡萄牙人某、於去年十一月九日夜間、在月宫旅社四號　房間目覩葉海生行兇歸來、與九號房間</p>
<p>寓客談話　者、今已傳案、當可證明是時葉與人談話之情狀、庭上遂命該葡人至證人欄、加以質訊、據其人譯稱、彼服務於救人會、是夜因赴月宫四號房間訪　粤籍友人李天、旋見九號室門半啟、葉海生足跨該室之　、面泛蒼白色、九號之寓客鄰仁孝詢以何故如此、葉答方自外間打架歸也、該葡人又調皮彼與楊文道昔在廣東俱樂部相識、迄已數年、與周社榮亦在該處相識、但為時尙暫、而與葉海生則在</p>
<p>舞塲相識　庭上質之楊等三被告、均承認與該葡人相識不諱、而周並稱、此次我在大陸舞塲被拘時、斯人則自稱為包探、葉海生旋稱、雖與相識、會被歐打、與其所述、純屬子虚無稽之談耳、研訊至此、所有人證、悉告完備、遂由兩造律師名逞其唇槍舌劍、開始言詞辯論、首由起訴之律師汝葆　將本　案始未、並就各種證物及證言、認定各被告應　負共同</p>
<p>殺人罪責　之理由、詳細陳述、歴一時三刻之久、其言略謂、本案經庭上嚴密推勘之下、各被告究竟有無殺人之關係、所須注意者、厥唯種種證據、中山秀雄之被槍傷身死、乃不争之事實、出事後、捕房警員與日軍司令所派到塲調查者、不下一二百人、而途人之聚觀者尤　、經兩小時調查之結果、發見手槍子彈及彈壳、帶回捕房檢騐之下、（斷定此卽殺人之兇器、於是進而偵查兇手、時有現已</p>
<p>離滬婦人　浦巧英、與前經傳案作證之、胡祥和、適行經出事處、目覩兇手兩人奔逃時之形狀、及根據其所述、並他方之所得、緝捕各被告、更因葉海生供稱手槍由楊文道發給、故往楊家搜查、果搜得藏置手槍之書籍、後以楊謂該書係被人裁陷、遂引起掉包誣害等疑問、然經過縝密調查、及各證人證明此書搜出帶回捕房時、楊文道承認之情狀而觀、則此物理學一書、碓係楊物、毫無疑義、楊因欲始終推諉、故復狡稱彼之</p>
<p>藏置手槍　者、旣係另一書籍、而所藏亦係另一手槍、但捕房會將楊所供牌號之手槍吊到、置諸此書所挖洞內、竞格格不入、顯見此書之洞、祗能藏此行兇之槍、彼所調裁害、誠不足信、若以書洞係他人所挖、焉能適合此槍之式、况槍自檢獲至今、僅日軍司令部取去九天、餘時均在捕房保管、斷不　入他人之手、而有依樣葫　之事、且槍銹核於書銹之相同者、更有四十二點之多、是旣無</p>
<p>偽造機會　又有如許之雷同、何能抵賴哉、總之、此槍已屬殺人兇器、藏斯槍之書、復從楊家所搜得、雖楊否認書及彼之原書、謂係楊建中陷害、對於本案輙稱不知、此外無其他有力之反證、自不足缷其罪責、至於葉海生、則自靑岛拘到之時、彼固不知楊已被捕、兇器亦經搜出、故尙圖賴、嗣悉鐵案如山、已無推諉之餘地、始於第三次提審時自白不諱、以後每度被　、供認愈明晣、彼非</p>
<p>無知之流　當知殺人罪之嚴重、倘無關係、焉肯冒味自承、惟至五月二七日提審時、則突然翻供、謂前此之供認、係不堪捕房之非刑、當五月二十一日被告之律師赴捕房見葉時、葉對其律師言、捕房待遇甚優、未提及受刑之事、而五月二十日法官臨出事處履勘之際、葉如受有冤屈、儘可拒絕表演、蓋爾時捕房當不致刑逼之也、然其始終從容表演行兇之狀態、並糾正向日證人胡祥和所供、葉於開槍后逃奔</p>
<p>路綫錯誤　之證言、足徴當時之表演、既係自動、必與事實相符、不料其竟有二十七日之行爲、且當庭哭訴受刑之種類、謂一係以香烟灼其唇、一以自來水灌其鼻、彼因非刑難堪、曾潛呑身藏之銅鎖匙自殺、無論捕房對於案犯檢查甚嚴、必使身無他物、嗣將葉送山醫院、以愛克司光鏡照其腹中、並無銅質之物、乃葉又謂所呑必已瀉出、至唇上微傷、亦經騐明、實非火灼、縱使捕房有</p>
<p>用刑之事　必施之於狡賴之徒、若葉已經屢屢自白、殊無加刑之必要、如以爲將使葉誣服而用非刑、則又何不並楊·周·亦加刑乎、葉雖提出反證、但彼祗能證明十一月八日及十日之行止、而本案發生之九日、則付缺如也、周社榮之對本案、亦由葉供出曾參加謀議、自是共犯、應請將該三被告依殺人罪治以死刑云云、繼由葛肇基律師爲楊文道·周社榮·辯護、謂楊文道原有一</p>
<p>藏置手槍　之書、尚係二十三年由楊建中授以挖洞之術、因被告家小孩多、如此藏置、可避危險、該書忽於本年二月無着、直至被搜出之日、始復再見、故被告疑係楊建中將此書換去原書、以遂其栽害之圖、周社榮更與本案無關、應請宣告無罪、又由郭啟明律師亦爲楊辯白一過、葉海生之選任律師張志讓·范剛·乃相繼發言、張律師以法醫研究所之鑑定報告書爲其辯護之重心、認定本案三被告、</p>
<p>俱無關係　殺害中山秀雄者、另有第三者其人也、大旨略謂鑑定書內以死者之傷、係被相距甚邇者所致、則開槍之人、必屬與死者並肩而行之輩、决非葉所殺害、查死者被害之日、自晨至暮、出入妓寮四家之多、此可知其人性頗風流、所至率受妓女之歡迎、最後離妓院爲晚間八時四十分、中途遂遭槍殺、顯然由於爭風而致命、今葉等之被波及、則純屬一般</p>
<p>圖得賞金　之徒、搆陷之舉、而楊文道初不細察、以爲此書卽彼之原書、驟覩之下、竟自將鹿作馬、楊建中既係文道之姪、而願舉叔之住址、報告於欲得乃叔者之前、則其又何憚於易書耶、至子彈彈壳發見之處、均非該水兵倒地之所、且該彈復難騐明曾染血漬、故該水兵之傷、未可斷定確屬此槍此彈所擊、況在楊家搜出者並非手槍、而僅爲藏槍之書籍、故楊實無犯罪之嫌疑、葉海生對於槍彈等物、尤</p>
<p>毫無關係　然其雖自承爲兇手、但與本案之事實、則殊多矛盾、自難置信、應請省釋云云、於是范律師與周社榮之律師唐懷羣·及王士宗·律師相繼辯畢、張檢察官遂而論告、謂楊文道初承認該書係其所有、後以被楊建中潛換、就該兩人之關係而論、建中確有潛換之可能、而法醫研究之結果、亦認定該書</p>
<p>似屬偽造　由是而言、文道犯罪之證據、殊嫌薄弱而不足、葉海生雖經自白、然其表演、多與事實相反、且當中山秀雄被害之前後數天、葉之行動如常、毫無異狀、由此觀之、犯罪嫌疑、亦屬不足、周社榮更無關係之足言、應請依法裁判云云、錢庭長嗣論下星期五（十七日）上午宣判、楊等還押、退庭時已鐘鳴六下矣、</p>

<p>中央社特派員馮有眞（第二信續一）</p>
<p>同舟聯誼</p>
<p>今天是六月最後的一天、陰沈的天氣、增加了海上的恐怖、郵船在中國海裏昂然前進、雖然沒有遇到怎樣大的風浪、但是多少總有點不很平靜、午餐的時候、在餐桌上數了一數、竟空了十五六個座位、沒有航海經騐的人、對這樣的天氣、大概是祇有咒咀的、午餐以後下了一陣大雨、竟天霽起來、大家都躺在甲板的籐椅上、吹風納凉、有幾位有航海經騐的人、出發以前、帶了很多的大頭菜榨菜、據說這兩樣東西、醫治暈船比什麼藥品都還有效力、於是大家都搶着吃、好像是大旱中得了甘霖、</p>
<p>下午五點鐘、船上舉行一次救生演習、全船的職員水手旅客、都參加演習、汽笛發出短促的吼聲、警鐘連續的敲着、大家都好像眞的遇險似的、趕着跑到房間裏把救生衣穿上、然後跑到指定的甲板上集合、救生衣穿的不合法的、由船上的職員加以指導糾正、過了五分鐘、汽笛發出脫險的號聲、卽行解散、這樣的演習、使大家增加許多遇險時的常識、是很有意義的、</p>
<p>康特浮台輪、自有航行史以來、所載中國旅客之多、這次大概算是造了一個新紀錄了、除了選手團一百餘名外、中國旅行社所組織的參觀世運游歐團團員有三十三名、其餘赴歐同胞如駐德大使館副武官潘華國君、赴德研究軍事之鄧樹仁君、網球名手羅志建君等、亦有二三十名之多、計共二百餘名、</p>
<p>中國旅行社的游歐團團員有三位要在新加坡才上船、其餘三十位中、計北平南京各一名、香港三名、上海二十五名、北平的那位就是司法界聞名的江庸先生、被推爲團長、他們的路綫是游歷義·奧·捷克·德·荷·英·比·法·瑞·再由義返國、江庸先生事畢、尙須赴奧出席世界司法會議、</p>
<p>大家覺得在這二十多天的海程中、應該組織起來、切實聯絡一下、所以發起組織「世運同舟聯誼會」、推江先生爲會長、並推幹事九人、選手團方面所推出的是郝更生袁敦禮和記者三人、游歐團推劉震律師、王弼臣醫師、與旅行團幹事鄧炳銓君、其餘三位、是潘華國鄧樹仁薛履坦三君、大概過了新加坡、就要由幹事會决定聯誼的方法、誰說我們中國人是沒有組織的能力的、</p>
<p>游藝興濃</p>
<p>七月一日天氣晴朗、太陽的光輝照射在海面上、映成金黃色的波紋、眞是美麗極了、大家都很興奮活躍、再不像昨天那樣抑鬱愁悶、</p>
<p>早上七時起舉行早操半小時、以後將每天按時舉行、游藝委員會發起舉行象棋比賽、參加者舒鴻·冷培根·林紹洲·王守方·劉長春·錢一勤·宋君復·江振德·吳德懋·戴淑國·鄭懷賢·彭文餘·張爾鼎·和記者共十四人、比賽用淘汰制、對局者須賽三局、勝局得二分、和局各一分、以先得四分者獲勝、初賽已於今天早上舉行、頂定七月四日產生錦棋、照形勢看來、冠軍大約不出吳德懋與林紹洲之手、象棋賽結束後、還要舉行圍棋錦標賽、在長途的旅程中、這種遊藝增加大　家許多興趣、</p>
<p>討論委員會爲使大家多少知道一點德文、减少到德國後言語上的困難起見、從今天起開始敎授德文、由德顧問柯特、繙譯員梅馥香、考察團員吳徵、醫生黃元愷等、分四班敎授、每班都有十幾惆人參加、</p>
<p>全團中這兩天患病的竟達十餘人之多、有的是因爲飲食冷熱不調、吃不慣鬧肚子、有的是因爲房間裏熱、開着電風扇睡、着了凉、黃元愷醫生忙得不得開交、所幸尙無大碍、吃了些藥都好了、</p>
<p>游藝委員會定明天晚上舉行第一次游藝會、地點是在頭等艙音樂窒、除掉代表團外所有船中中西旅客都邀請他們參加、游藝節目除開塲正正式式的唱黨歌致開會詞外、尙有全體女團員的合唱、王懷琪江振德矮子演講、國術隊表演國術、符保盧陳寶球滑稽舞蹈、那時必有許多噱頭、</p>
<p>明天（二日）早晨九點鐘可到新加坡、一千四百五十一海哩的路程、不久叉可告一段落了、郵船預定在新加坡停留七小時、聽說那裹的華僑、將舉行一個歡迎大會、大家都準備去參加、並且想觀光一番、關於到新加坡的情形、祇好隔四天後、到哥倫坡再報告了、　（未完）</p>

<p>— 陳膽星</p>
<p>兩個多月的長期暑假現在開始了，不論在馬路上，輪船碼頭和火車站，都有着女同學們的踪跡，興忽忽的帶看行李和書藉，登上旅途，回轉伊們的故鄕。半年攻讀，過着刻扳而枯澀的學校生活，不免感到乏味，此去大家都懷着安逸過夏的意念，在家中，沒有課程的牽制，一切瑣屑，更不用自己費心操勞，伊們的心理；以爲受過都會智識的現代新女子，對於那些瑣屑的家務是不屑去做的。讀書上課而外，便是「享福」。</p>
<p>這心里是普遍的，所以错误亦是普遍的。我以爲暑期的意義，决不是呌同學們—連女同學亦在內—回家去—「避暑」或「享福」，而正是一個適當的機會，可以從多少帶些空洞性的書本教育而去實際體味一下生活敎育。小至家庭瑣務的練醫，大至間接直接地去帮助鄉鎭地方的衛生工作，和生活習慣的改革。目下有好多自命爲新式女子的小姐們，常常看不起母親或傭婦們所勞作着的事情，更看不起故鄕地方上的那種簡陋形式，滿以爲自己生來是屬於都會的，去管理鄉鎭的事，便是莫大的無聊。尤其奇怪的，有些新式的女子自己認爲所不屑做的事情，却希望別人去動手，而且自己躺在籐椅上評論着。伊們並未想到，自己是否會受到更嚴厲的評論！</p>
<p>「你們爲什麼要求學？」這問題大家都會爽快答覆，或是要做婦女運動的主力分子，或是要做女政治家，或是志在服務社會。决沒有說：我求學後，預備做寄生蟲，做享福的社會分利者。志向誠然偉大，抱負誠然不凡，可是，要領導羣衆，服務社會，効勞國家，怎樣的開其端呢？要不要事先有一番練習呢？我想；從瑣屑做到大事業，從局部地方做到整個社會，那是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>暑期中回到家庭的女同學們，莫蹉跎了這個機會吧，要知道偷閒享福是母庸練習的。此刻的勞作，便是你們將來志願實踐的根基。</p>
<h3 id="c188">英國婦女的結婚年齡 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 裴俞</p>
<p>靑春時期就是戀愛時期，可說是盡人皆知的，但是在現在的英國，戀愛時期並不是結婚的需要時期了，變爲一個盛行遲婚的國家了。根據戶口調查的統計報吿說，在一八七一年，每一千名的二十歲女子中的結婚率是一三三·七。在一九二一年是一一四·四；在一九三一年是一〇六·五。在一八七一年，每一千名的二十五歲至三十歲間的女子中的結婚率是八五·九，在一九二一年是一〇〇，在一九三一年是九六·九。男子方面的統計如下：在一八七一年，每一千名二十歲的男子中的結婚率是一二二·四，在一九二一年是九四·四；在一九三一年是七二·五。二十五歲至三十歲間男子中的結婚率是：在一八七一年是一一九·三，在一九二一年是一六一·一，在一九三一年是一四〇·八。這裏有一點値得注意的，就是在一八七一年，每一千名二十歲的孀婦中的再嫁率是一七〇·五，比同年齡的女子的結婚率來得高。在一八七一年，每一千名二十歲的鰥夫中的再婚率是二二九·〇，比同年齡的結婚率顯有急速的增加。</p>
<p>若欲注意到現在和維多利亞時代之間的改變情形，祇要看到英國的皇室便知一二。維多利亞女皇在二十一歲前便已結婚，所嫁的親王年紀並不比伊大。伊的會孫格勞賽斯　公爵（按卽英新皇愛德八世之弟，於去年十一月初結婚。）到了三十五歲纔結婚，所娶的公爵夫人年紀也是三十四歲了。在維多利亞時代，一個未婚女子到了二十五歲已經算年紀大了；到了二十八歲，伊是一個老處女了。一個年紀三十五歲或四十歲的男子娶妻要在年紀十八歲至二十一歲的少女中去尋，而且這種年紀的男子娶妻大概是娶續絃了。現在丈夫與妻子可稱爲朋友和遊侶，有時候可稱爲工伴。不論居住在宮邸中或茅屋中，夫與妻都是生活上的伴侶。遲婚可以帮助成爲理想的結合，得到理想的伴侶。這是改變社會情形的結果之一，無疑是爲了個人幸福而造成的。但是科學家和政治家對於這種情形很憂慮。他們認爲這是生育率减退的重要原因之一。</p>
<p>在一八八一年英吉利與惠爾斯的人口是二千六百萬，生產的嬰兒有九十萬。在一九三一年，人口是四千萬，生產的嬰兒卻祗有六十三萬了。國會議員安諾德感爾　爵士告訴不列巓恊會說：「我們的人口靜止的時間不會再長，或許要减少了，女子的遲婚是直接的原因之一。貧窮不是生育率衰落的要素。結婚男女所希望的生活標準是很大的要素。人們在審愼地選擇一輛汽車或小兒車的時候，總是選擇汽車，那就含有希望减少兒童的意義了。」總之，現在的人們在結婚之前要仔細打算一下。茅屋中的戀愛不像從前茅屋中的戀愛一般的普遍了，除非茅屋中有良好的煤氣灶，電氣掃帚，電氣熨斗，廚房中有節省勞力的設備。不是說現在沒有精神上的戀愛，一定要建立在物質的享受上，實則是常識豐富，見聞廣博的緣故。所以結婚常要等到三十歲左右。現在生活與享福的標準增進了，對於年紀大小的觀念和以前大不相同，誰也不會想說三十歲的時代姑娘是年紀大的。而且現在的婦女不再是奴隸了。伊們有自由，伊們有較大的機會去我尋職業來維持生活。我們非但不應該反對　婚，而且要帮助伊們滿足一切的要求，創造獨立的精神。</p>
<h3 id="c189">結婚的衛生與健康 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>當前的婦女問題，大家一開口，總是性的解放，職業的自由，以及生活的平等等等，而很少有人注意到結婚的衛生與健康等問題，這實在是一個很不好的現象。近見基市衛生當局，發表某女校所錄取的新生，經體格檢騐之下，竟發現着有若干是有先天梅毒的，若干是有直接傳染着的梅毒的。現在的女學生大部分，總都是從水平綫之上的家庭中來的，而同時，自身總也是具有相當智識的，尙不免於先天的或後天的染有梅毒，那麼，這種審菌的猖獗情形，當不難推想而知。因此，我覺得在這婦女旣巳爭得婚姻自由的年頭兒，在結婚之前，不可忽略着對手方的衛生程度，與健康情形。</p>
<p>德國爲了取締德人與猶太人結婚起見，曾頒佈了若干條結婚的規律，但這些規律，在實際上，也不只是取締德猶通婚，同時，就是德人與德人結婚，有若干條，也是不無關係的。例如任何一方或雙方的體格不健全，如患有梅毒，肺病等疾病，而不得醫生出具健康證明書的，概在禁止結婚之列。還自然是極堪玩味的一件事，因爲息有惡疾的父母，所生的子女，自然是不能成爲健康的國民的。德意志民族，是素以優秀著稱的，所以當屬者，頗以產生出不健康的國民爲慮。我們中國是一個積弱的國家，若是再因循下去，任令患有梅毒或肺病的男女結婚，將來的中華民族，將不知變成怎麼的一個嘴臉呢。</p>
<p>基於上述的理由，我覺得在結婚之前，雙方都有請醫生檢騐，證明無梅毒，無肺病，或其他惡疾的必要、若是發現某方有惡疾的，須延緩結婚，或竟解的以免傳染，而遺終身之累。若是實因愛情熱烈，不忍出之以斷然的手　，那麼我以爲務須厲行節制生育，以免所生的子女，無辜而墮入不幸的命運中去。這是在民族與家庭二方面，都受其益的。現在各市都盛行着集團結婚，我想這倒可以明文規定着，凡是申請加入集團結婚的，槪須呈繳醫生的檢騐證書，證明無可以應　對手方的衛生與健康的疾病的，才許加入。這一層，在目前，似乎是一種苛例，但是除了這　個辦法，誰能立例而資提倡呢？</p>
<p>還有，現在一般的普通女子，大都對於花柳病的認織，太不足，往往丈夫染有毒的妻子，還給　得，一點兒不知道。待到自己給丈夫染得了，雖然咸到痛苦，但又羞於求聲，以致造成不可思議的後果。道也是極平常的事。在這種塲合，我謹勸一般婦女們，須具備一些花柳常識，以資監視丈夫的健康與衛生，而資自衛。若是給丈夫傳染了，那麼，切不可任其滋蔓，務須及早求醫治療，免致產生出先天有毒的子女來而後悔莫及。</p>

<p>— 朱君宜</p>
<p>新福州遠在南島，中國南海之南，婆羅們洲的北岸，該地在三十年前不過，是一片荒土僻壤，淸末光緒以後，華僑在開始到這裏來墾殖，這些人都是福建同胞，偶然到海外去尋找棲身之所，而無意找到了這塊荒地，因爲風景宜人，天氣又溫暖，土地也肥沃，他們就在這地方住了，謀永遠的居住，以後，因爲十之八九是福州人，所以就名　該地　爲新　福州，全域居民不過三萬，而婦女的人數　還不及男子三分之一，她們和男子處於不平等地位，壯年的都勤於操作，年邁和年少的女子　却是很少很少的，</p>
<p>那裏除了　年老和幼年的女子在家操作外，年壯的十分之八是在樹膠—亦稱橡皮—園裏工作的，因爲那個　地方遍植膠樹，非常茂盛，當地的華僑都依此爲業。她們對於經濟方面，確有自給能力，而且綽有餘裕，所以家庭的生計得她們的資助很不淺，爲國內婦女及不到的優點。</p>
<p>她們每天約工作十小時左右，而且都在烈日下操勞，工作程序是這樣的，先用犁刀割那樹膠皮。然後用杯去使膠質流入，一杯一杯的傾入桶內，再把桶內的膠質送到另一地方，用藥水勻和膠質，使牠凝固。以便用機器　碾成一片一片的橡皮，然後洗滌，她們所用的器具，這樣一天的工作　就算完畢。而可以成羣結隊很快樂的到江邊　洗浴，和預備晚餐了。</p>
<p>她們照例着一天一天地過去，除非是偶然在晚間或早晨下了一塲大雨，此外是沒有休息機會的，但也有　小半是篤信基督敎，、須嚴守安息日，所以在　星期那天是能够休息。可以在十幾個小時內須　動也不能動的悶生在禮拜堂內，反而木能像在　樹膠園內工作的逍遙自由！</p>
<p>至於她們　這樣勤勞地工作，所得的酬報有多少呢？當從前生活低廉營業　　的時候。每個婦女約可月得三四十元的收入，可是現在的情形却大不相同了。原因是樹膠的價　格隆落，各地都搶着作這生意，能够維持她們日　常生活的已是難得可貴，萬一發生疾病或不幸　的喜喪等事，那就費　無所出了。</p>
<p>「每日三餐，祇求飽腹，」這是她們關於飲食的諺語，因爲那裏也沒有美味佳餚可以買到，至於所穿的大　都是糧布做的。本來女子是具有愛美性的，然而她們却不喜歡裝飾，毫無奢侈的習氣，這種地方値得使人欽佩！</p>
<p>她們的婚姻　問題都是由父母強迫執行，做兒女的絲毫不敢反抗，而且婚姻的目標　以金錢門戶爲前提，那個能出重大的聘金，就能把這女子據爲己有。作者在該地僑居十年，耳所聞目所見的，沒有一個女子不是在這買　賣式的婚姻制度下訂婚的，至於考其原因不外　下面幾個原因：　因爲男多於女，不敷分配。　因爲多數訂婚的男子　都在三十歲以上，　女子能作工可以减輕男子負擔，　女子未能受到相　當敎育。缺乏知識。沒有反抗的原因。所以在　不久以後，敎育若能普及，這專制的婚姻制度也許會　漸漸地淘汰掉的。</p>

<p>— 張聿秀</p>
<p>嬰兒因了母親有種種疾病，得不到母乳者很多，這班嬰兒，往往因爲人要哺養法的食物配置不得當，或平常衛生方面失宜，往往有又肥又白的嬰兒，一得病，就不能醫治的，以致近來醫界發覺人工哺乳，嬰兒，與母乳哺養，嬰兒，其死亡率，有　人之不同。我現在把比較科學化的食物配置法，介紹給因　而不能　乳的母親們，以作參考。</p>
<p>至於母乳之益處，如溫度合宜，乳內有天然免疫性能使嬰兒亦獲天然免疫之效，嬰兒所需要的一切，母乳已全給頂備着等等，我在另一篇已詳加說明了。</p>
<p>代母乳之配置</p>
<p>以牛乳代母乳，其缺點代爲：　沒有免除疾病的要索，　食時之溫度又不易弄凖，　牛乳爲小牛天然之飮料，對於人體當然有許多不含宜的地方，（如牛乳中之蛋白不易消化卽是一種）茲將牛乳與人乳之比較列下：</p>
<p>看上表，了知牛乳的成份與人乳相差的地方很多，所以我們用人工哺乳，必須使與人乳相差較近的，才可應用，現在有一新發明的方法，卽用乳酸，將牛乳內的蛋白，先行消化一部，加水，稀釋牛乳，再加糖，以防乳內之糖份不足，其法如下：預備一白磁量杯一玻璃滴管，一瓶乳酸（Lactic　Acid）及玻璃棍，或竹筷。以上器具，須完全消毒，將買來的牛乳煮沸後，卽放在冰箱內，或用水使冷（以牛乳鍋放在盛冷水盆內）依照以下之分劑，以玻璃滴管吸乳酸（Lacitc　Acid），一手調牛乳，一手徐徐滴入乳酸，若見牛乳有凝結狀，應滴的乳酸，幷當立卽停止，做好後，放回冰箱，要用時，用熱水溫之，卽可喂。分劑配置如左：　（未完）</p>

<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>一般的學校中，所敎授的，都是國文，外國文，算學，理化，史地等等。專門學校中，更是專攻着各種專科的。這種敎育，顯然地是不適宜於我國的佔　絕對大多數，以結婚爲出路的女子的。雖然在若干女學校中，也有縫紉，烹飪等課程，但這些有用的課程，遠不如其他各項普通課程那麼　的注意，也是放在面前的事實。這種情形，或許在美國，也正是同病相憐，所以在不久之前，曾有「新娘學校」的創設，以訓練一般　將作新娘的婦女以一種　處理家政的常識。這種新娘學校的組織與課程，無由窺得其全豹，所以在這裏，也無法加以研究。但是我總覺得家政的　處理，是千頭萬緒，不是幾個月，或是幾星期的敎室敎育，所能訓練成功的。而更有許多治家法，絕對不是讀講義，寫筆記，所能心領而神會的。爲切於實用起見，我覺得實有創設一個「主婦通問學校」的必要。</p>
<p>主婦通問學校中，可分成若干組、例如「縫紉」，「烹飪」，「靑嬰」，「御夫」，「管理傭候」，「家庭衛生」，「交際」，「節育」，「家庭讀物」……等等，都可創設。若干組別，不需集中在一處的。例如「縫紉組」，可委成衣公司負責。「育嬰組」，可委慈幼機關辦理。一家庭讀物組」，可委書報的經銷處兼管。各組的工作，可各委專門機關負責。所謂通問學校，裏面儘也不用若干偉大的設備，也不需大數的辦事員，書記員等等。學校的責任，不過是接洽可靠的分組　辦事處，以及指導通問者，向適當的所在訊問，及承轉各項通問的　函件而已。若是工作發達，那麼，自然還可編輯通問彙刋，把某一時期中的若干有價値的問答，公開發表，分贈或分售給各家庭的主婦。在一相當時期中，更可製成各組的通問統計，而研究着那一項課程的　需要發展與改良。</p>
<p>若是這種通問學校，眞的創辦之後，我想，各家庭中，初爲主婦日或是初生孩子的　母親們，必將感到極大的愉快與便利。偶有難於解决的家政處理問題，只須寫一封信，到通問學校去，由通問學校，轉往某組，或直接寫信到某組去訊問，或打電話往某組，直接訊問，都能得到答複與指導。這自然比了向鄰居請敎，而得到不負責，或不合理的指導，或是自己從失敗之中，去求得經騐的，將不知强上若干了。因此，我覺得這種通問學校的創設，在目前，是極有商榷的價値的。海上不乏熱心　婦女幸福的士女！我想這或許是會在不久的將來　實現着，而爲　無治家經騐的主婦們造福的。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>致力廠務，辛勸終年，不顧自身享樂；　救濟貧困，栽培學子，全爲社會造福！</p>
<p>前幾天報章登載國勞奧林匹克大會頒給一等獎，得獎人爲我國吳蘊初先生，這是一件非常榮譽的事。吳先生是國內化學工業的領袖，不知費了幾許心血，纔換得這顆獎章，這要比我們國內的一等采玉章貴重得多，而且他是代表我們中國人獲得國際間的榮譽，換句話說：替我們大家爭些面子，所以値得道喜的。記得張伯苓先生曾說過中國有兩位化學工業家，便是「南吳北范」，南方是吳先生，北方是范旭東先生，范氏所創的事業，在華北很佔勢力；吳氏在上海手創天廚味精，天利淡氣，天原電化，天盛陶器，這四廠是他一身心血的結晶，也是有關國防的民族工業。吳氏不但於事業憚精竭慮，於學衛孜孜不倦；而持躬處世，忠信篤敬，平心而論，確是大衆的模範。他的夫人戴儀女士，是怎樣的人，也許外間很少知道，那末我告訴你，她是知行合一的勞動者，也値得稱爲女界的模範，下面是我訪談的速寫。</p>
<p>當我走進天廚總管理處的時候，只見工作人員異常忙碌，一邊有三位女職員，正和男女工談話，吳先生邀入客室，我說明來意，先問他的住宅，他伸手指示廠房的四樓，次問他的夫人，連忙到隔壁請她過來，他笑着說：『我沒有公館，那間房是我倆的臥室，她是終年在廠服勞的。』原來所見女職員中的一位，便是吳夫人，她是天廚的廠務生任。自民國十二年五月成立到如今，每天準時辦公，從不缺席，關於工友管理，出品審核，工作支配，都是她一手承辦的。她說：「現在廠中人員較多，分工合作，事務易於處理；當草創時，不論鉅細，全由我二人分担下來的。」啊！這位夫人眞了不得，穿的土產布衣，不染半點脂粉，而身强力壯，精神飽滿。「夫人十餘年來，努力廠務，家政由誰至持的？」我首先這樣問她。「我的家庭簡單極了，那間臥室，除床椅桌凳外，一無長物，我倆一天到晚，在廠裹工作，吃飯，夜間才去安憩，雇一位老媽，替我照管着，她已被雇二十多年了。我只有一個兒子，今夏滬江大學畢業，不久便赴美留學，沒有兒女之累，儘可盡我的本能。不瞞你說，我是不善交際的，工作之餘，有七八十位女工作伴侶，她們在工作時悉心盡力，在業餘到俱樂部，玩各　游藝，廠中很優待，她們也很安慰，彼此親熱，猶如一家人。其中有許多年輕的姑娘，富於進取心，識字學校讀了兩個月，仍有志於學，我便自任指導，如國文。算學。常識等科，有問必答，我覺得凡是工商組織，如能上下一體，相處以誠，斷無意外的糾紛，人究竟是有同情心的，你以爲對麼？」這，是吳夫人說得很動聽的一段話。</p>
<p>「夫人對於社會公益事業，抱何種態度？」「我因廠務較繁，對外間事不常與聞，近年聯絡女界組織上海市婦女恊進會，忝任常委，每有家庭不睦而離婚的婦女，無所歸宿，由我維持她們的生活。每年以私資裁培貧苦的兒童，也有十餘人。五年前吳先生設淸寒敎育基金恊會，我首先贊成，每年招考十二人，保送國內大學肄業，現已畢業兩班，資助他們全部費用，每人年需七八百金，五年中，已費六七萬元。他們很能刻苦自勵，將來大有希望。去年吳先生主張購天廚飛機兩架，贈給政府，當初會徵求我同意，我說國難至此，人人應有救國之心，此舉足以號召國人建設國防，我是極端同意的。」夫人也談到平時對吳先生的態度，說得很中肯，她說；「人們服務社會，難免不如意事，像他那樣一團和氣的人，有時也會受到刺激，我是女流，除用言語安慰外，別無長策，凡事能自己奮勉，必可戰勝一切。吳先生有一點長處，只爲事業努力，不管家中瑣屑，就是出遠門吧，我勸他什麼也不要顧慮，反正家事容易處理的。我們只有星期休息一天，平素極少娛樂，逢到新年例假，纔有出外旅行的機會，享幾天優游的淸福。」</p>
<p>我覺得像他們的所作所爲，眞是爲人羣謀福利，爲社會國家畏元氣；這種偉大的精神，値得爲大家效法。當今人慾橫流，世風日隳，我所以不憚費辭，慶次介紹超羣卓越的人，無非勸大家做好人，行善事；要如以我過分說人家的好話，那未免顚倒是非了！</p>

<p>斌坤先生：</p>
<p>靑年涉足花叢，喜歡以寶貴的光陰，消磨在桃色氛圍裏，誠如來信所云：「這是極普遍而習見的事實」而且，還有着不少色情狂的靑年們，悍然不顧一切，情愿拿畢生的信譽，有限的精力，來犧牲而換取無謂的肉欲，所以要振刷社會淫亂的風氣，第一的癥結，先要來糾正社會靑年的心理，不然是永成夢想了！</p>
<p>現在旣然弄得這樣地步，你應該趕快「懸崖勒馬，改過自新。」不然前途的黑暗，是可斷定的。不過第一要緊實先要將你的身體治好，你來信所說：「因涉足花叢而感染淋症，並且患有劇烈的神經衰弱症，問時將你醫治的經過，也不厭求詳地很詳細的報告我了。」惟有一點：對於你自己不仔細而誤服所謂非特異性舊療法爲號召的賤價劣藥，以致久陷於痛苦之中而不能自拔，以前非但使你的金錢消耗殆盡，並且病症有轉入慢性的趨勢，這幾點我也代你扼腕過。你的不幸，是社會陷你的，是仿冒狡猾的商人陷你的，歸根結底，你自己缺少辨別的常識，這也是使你增加痛苦原因之一。</p>
<p>你的牢騷，你的憤慨，你對劣藥的深深的痛恨，這是你親歷其境所體味出來的經騐，我一概深表同情。因爲社會的複雜，人心的險詐，他們竟不借以最後成功四字來蒙蔽病家！這無怪你墮入殽中了。</p>
<p>現在你既然由了具有醫藥常識朋友的指導，服了「安敵淋」之後，病已霍然，同時你信上提及：「感激貴醫師負責詳細的診斷，這也是縮短病期的原因。」這一點凡是從事醫業者應盡的義務無所謂驚奇。你該知道：你的淋症雖然說：「不復憂慮了」不過稍覺耳鳴，頭痛，失眠，這足以證明你神經衰弱症還沒有痊愈　所以最緊要的不要故態復萌，同時趕快購服生殖腺素製劑的「生殖素」以補你虧損的精力，那比較有把握些，你以爲如何，怱此順頌痊安</p>

<p>— 周笑涵</p>
<p>一般女子之患病症，如屬於月經不調，白帶纏綿，及子宮口發生潰亂等等，都稱之爲婦人病。</p>
<p>假若一個靑春的少女，她有了自凟的行爲，那末身體自然虛弱了。身體虛弱的結果，月經不調症也接踵而來，此外婦人最引爲煩惱而輕視的重症，就是帶下，已婚的女子不必說，縱是未婚的處女，亦有不少罹患本症。本來一般所謂帶下，乃由陰部向外流出，浸潤外陰部與其附近。劇烈時流量特別多，甚至小便時感覺隱隱刺痛，帶下分爲生理與病態的區別，生理的帶下，自己毫不覺得，等到自己已經覺得，那足見分泌尢進已成病態了。</p>
<p>惹起帶下的原因有種種不同，不單是由於生殖器種種異常或疾病而起，因子宮頸管及陰道之疾病而起，（主要爲淋病性）其他原因因生殖器充血，分泌增加而起的，頗不少見。</p>
<p>一個婦女患了本症時其痛苦何異囚人牢獄，假若有孕的婦人，而患了淋病性的帶下。若不先把帶下症來治好，那末胎兒的安全，是要生問題了，胎兒的雙目，因爲在產生時要經過婦產的陰道，大有失明的危險，而且母體的危險，也有加重的可能。因爲帶下之結果，使你的身體虛弱，百病叢生，試想這樣是否可以安全分娩嗎？在中國的婦女界裏，她們以爲受婦人科的診察以爲可羞，對於診查發生躊躇，公開的檢騐，是不受她們歡迎的。所以家庭的自療常識，爲多數婦女亟要知道而研討的。不過因身體病態的緣果而惹起月經不調症，那祗服一種用生殖腺素製劑的女用「生殖素」即可治愈，其他患有帶下的婦人，應該先要知道其病源，如屬於淋病性者，那必須要先服「安敵淋」然後再用治帶靈藥之「療帶靈」方可在短期治愈，「療帶靈」不但止帶迅速，對於婦女們所患的子宮炎陰癢糜爛，均可應手治愈，患婦女病的女靑年，對上述的三種家庭自療法，千切不要遺忘。</p>

<p>— 劉志民</p>
<p>不問你因何病源而覺筋骨酸痛，總之應該速服强斯登氏的「骨痛片」，這也無需我的介紹，精明的病家已早在推崇了，真可以說到一聲：「有口皆碑」「無遠勿屆」不論你骨節酸痛也好，腦骨刺疼也好，甚至你四肢拘攀，腎部酸痛，關節炎痛，或者弄得半身不遂，都可在五十片內，發生效力。因爲「骨痛片」每瓶裝滿五十片，確有一瓶回春之妙，並且具有腦充血嫌疑的人，尤其要及早預防，原因是腦充血的促成，純由動脈硬化之故，惟有該骨痛片，可以防止動脈的硬化，尿毒症的朋友，也有非此莫愈之概，所以强斯登「骨痛片」的功效，决不致於使病家遺忘的，我想我們中國人患骨痛病的人，也特別的多，需要這樣的忠誠指導，也有不少人在睜眼期望吧。</p>

<p>說起來會使我們害怕，一個人有一種最痛苦的病，就是每個靑年，未到中年，已是精神頹廢，暮氣沉沉，真是壯年之齡，已與死神接近矣，可痛執甚？　試以分析這種體質的造成，無疑的是平時不知攝生之法。但也有先天的不足，而顯示虛弱者，這也不可一概而論。但是不論其爲先天的或是後天的，總而言之，應該未雨綢繆，我的意見，人體的强壯與否，全靠身體各部新陳代謝的能力旺盛，那末主宰新陳代謝最重要的是血液的充足，血液充足之後，繼可以欣欣向榮，病患不生，而以虛弱的人及百病叢生的人，他身體的支持了，必定缺少主要的成分的血，血枯竭了，試問那有產生精液之可能。就是拿先天不足的人來講，很有同樣患有先天不足的人，一個因平時滋補得法，體力强盛，一個因爲不知攝生及補救的方法，結果增了無數的痛苦，此種情况，我想讀者不致於否認吧！藥品中最有滋補能力的效力，惟有以生殖腺素製劑的「生殖素」值得推崇的，其餘是平平了，講不到效力兩字了，患有未老先衰，百病叢生的衰頹男女，趕快揀你的生路走吧！試服一瓶，就有效力感覺了。</p>

<p>「淋病」</p>
<p>然而，這時候去尋找醫生，已嫌過遲了。如果病者能在得病的一兩天內，即作正當的醫治，將成的淋病不難用頓挫法迅治；到了病象已凶的時期，卽使立卽延醫，並且所請的醫師是極其正當的，那末這樣的痛苦最旺盛的時間，也要延長到一星期以上。此後倘使醫治的經過良好，則痛苦逐漸减輕，分泌物逐漸减少稀薄，由黃綠色的膿狀，變成灰白色的粘液，而尿道口和包皮的腫脹發赤，也漸次消褪。大概需要六星期左右，方可治愈。但是，這樣良好的經過，往往是不常遇見的。</p>
<p>有許多—而且釋大多數的患有淋病的人，到他們的淋病快將全愈的時候，因爲不知攝身，或爲飲酒，或爲房事，或作劇烈的運動，或因遺精的過多，或因醫者的注射强猛的藥劑，或因淋病自身的自然的由前尿道蔓延至後尿道，忽然重復凶惡起來。所以在淋病感染的初期，如能夠用具有透膜殺菌能力的藥物治療，决不致於中途變化，卽使後你痊愈最從事劇烈的運動，也無問題，不過市上出售的淋病藥大多了得緣故，所以會使你晚從辨別真僞，友而有被劣藥所誤的危險。現在最被病家信任醫師採用的治淋病，當推以黃色素製劑的「安敵淋」爲首，要揀選一種確有實效的治淋藥，也許要一半經騐纔可以知道，會經服過「安敵淋」而治愈的人，那都能道之。</p>

<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>遺精病的可怕，恐怕在性病中沒有比牠再厲害了。但是這可怕的東西，而靑年們罹患的數目，也特別的衆多，所以靑年間接的直接的因遺精而剝削生命，會經有過統計，要佔百分之三，七弱。那末以四萬萬的人口來平均一下，每年就有一千四百八十萬的生命，因遺精而命歸黃泉。這種損失真是全民族的損失，任何人不能漠然視之啊！</p>
<p>遺精對於生命喪失的關係，既如上述。那末靑年何以要罹這種可怕的病症呢？大部分的原因；是由自凟的行爲造成，所以靑年的人千切不可染成手淫的惡癖，不然在很短時間，會使你神經衰弱症暴發，因此患手淫的人，大都有耳鳴，頭痛，目眩，精神疲勞，失眠等症。本症頂好在未治愈前不必結婚，因爲結婚之後。會使你治療上發生困難，這是非常緊要的常識，應該記牢。同時趕快治療，應該知道，遺精的促成，純由身體的精液斵喪劇烈之故，因此精關不固，在不知不覺間會將精液流出，而病象惡化的人，在白天里也會流出的，所以本症應該選擇具有固精能力的希米脫氏「固精片」爲最有效的治療，這是萬試不爽的例子，萬勿輕忽！</p>

<p>諺有之：「庸醫誤人。劣藥殺人。」此語頗含至理。余聆最近淋病患者伍君及殷君來診所訴。於茲益信。據訴兩君咸誤於某庸醫之誇張號召。收索昔日之非特異性劣效舊療法。附會牽强。以售其標新立異之　　濃。均連服至十餘瓶之多。不惟耗盡金錢。且貽誤治療之病機云云。經余介紹向永安公司購服內服黃色素製劑「安敵淋」後。始告根治。余不禁重重有感也。不意最近該庸醫竟將內服黃色素加以攻擊。不知其何所據而云然。余本數十年來臨診經騐。所試療法。不知凡幾。其功效實未有出於內服黃色素之右者。該醫初爲助手出身。未有畢業文憑。就一知半解之皮毛。行醫已屬可憐。更有何資格以僞理攻人。余爲病家前途計。有不得緘默而息者。</p>
<p>消化不良</p>
<p>程德生君，藉隸安徽，現年念八歲，因職業煩苦，終日奔波，乃旋患消化不良症，每餐食量銳減，見飯輒厭，雖菜肴豐富，亦感乏味，如是久之，體力漸形不支，終至肌肉削瘦，心神萎頓，家人大恐，遍服市上所售關於健胃消化之藥，然毫無效騐，憂　萬分，漸見報載有某君亦患消化不良，服「健胃素」始告痊愈，乃照某君所載，向永安公司購服一瓶，分八日服完，竟有藥到病除之妙云</p>
<p>安全戒煙</p>
<p>趙斌爲松江縣人，染煙癮已有七載矣，於上年秋末，始從事於戒煙之努力，然多服含副作用之藥物，故呑服久之，全無實際之效騐，空費金錢，難收實益，友人以爲彼不肯决心戒煙，類多輕視之，彼乃力求靈藥，以冀早日脫離困苦中，今春由好友贈彼以「生殖素」半打，則依法內服，服未五盒，煙竟戒絕，可謂最靈速之戒劑矣。</p>
<p>胃痛治愈</p>
<p>X君「編者按寫來之報告單用此記號，真名無從知悉」食後每覺胃腕疼痛，且口吐酸味，同時據云坐臥不安，且心悶異常，彼乃購「胃痛靈」服之，刻病已痊愈云。</p>

<p>（一）恍恍惚惚精液淋漓</p>
<p>靑年男女每至春情發動之年，輒愈不及待，無不以手淫爲其洩慾之工具。故暗室自伐，精液虧耗，結果精關放弛，遺精難逃。蔑視爲靑年之通病。</p>
<p>前月底有湯金兩人，均犯手淫，且均有數年之時光，故在睡眠之時，恒覺神思恍惚，且醒來之後，精液滿褲，蔑視爲積習矣，近患神經衰弱症甚劇，百病叢生，面如鬼形，乃大驚恐，相率來余處診治，余乃以希米脫氏固精片主治其遺精，並告以再服「生殖素」以培補元氣，昨日金君介紹其戚來余處診治煙癮，始悉彼已復健康之途矣。</p>
<p>（二）姬妾滿堂肌肉削瘦</p>
<p>蓋人之精力有限，若過分消耗，則全身之肌肉，必至剝削殆盡，生殖機能必陷衰頹，肌肉削瘦，康健自無望矣，故政府乃嚴定一夫一妻制，卽此故也。茲有張君，爲浙之桐鄉人，家資鉅萬，家蓄姬妾四五，可謂日無間期，以致形體削瘦，精力不足。乃遍求藥力之滋補，上年春一度來滬，來余處求開滋補藥方，余乃告以生殖素腺製劑之「生殖素」可補一切體損精耗未老先衰等症，渠乃購去二打，近據來信云：精神壯盛，肌肉已豐滿矣。</p>

<h3 id="c201">阿比西尼亞亡了嗎？ <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>意國早已公然聲稱過吞併阿比西尼亞了，阿皇在國聯會的演說，也祇成爲史績，目下就連這一位倔强的帝王好像也頹了氣，據路透的電報說，他從日內瓦抵倫敦，「神色沮喪」。——所謂對意制裁，從十五日也將公佈取消了。</p>
<p>然而，阿比西尼亞難道就眞的從此亡了嗎？</p>
<p>沒有，絕對的沒有！阿皇的是否「神色沮喪」，我們是不能就此斷定阿國的前途的，國聯會早已給强權所姦汚了，這是顯見的事實，弱國不能依賴國聯而生存，這敎訓不待阿國來受，我們中國也早已受够了，阿皇如果眞因爲這次由國聯給他的失望而「神色沮喪」，那祇是阿皇個人的事情，阿比西尼亞的民衆，不是在最近發表的宣言中就說得明明白白：「阿比西尼亞全國人民，除在亞第斯亞貝巴城者，處于意軍壓迫之下，不能活動之外，均已一致决定，一俟雨季蒞臨，卽當繼續抗敵，雖赤手空拳，亦當奮鬥到底，以捍衛本國之獨立權，而將殘暴敵人，逐出神聖國土之外，非然者，凡足當阿比西尼亞人之稱者，亦必戟至不剩一人而後已也……」</p>
<p>由此，我們知道，阿國的人民是怎樣存了有敵無我的决心的，不是將「殘暴敵人」「逐出神聖國土之外」，便是亞國人民「戰至不剩一人」。這個，不僅是宣言中說得堂皇，而事實也的確這樣告訴我們：「……最近兩月，曾有武裝精利之「匪衆」（？）猛禦意軍，某夜阿京有意兵多人，爲人斷喉而死…意戌軍因與內地交通困難，多駐於大城，不敢遠出，阿斯巴薩法里有意戍軍數百人，爲武裝阿民數千人包圍，意當局謂現無法救之云。」（開羅路透六日電）</p>
<p>從上面的電訊中，它確確實實的告訴我們：阿國並沒有給意國滅亡！墨索里尼雖然興高采烈的說是已併吞了阿國，而事實上却並不盡然。</p>
<p>現在，雨季將開始了，我們讀了上面的宣言，將擬怎樣感想？不過我們知道，如果眞的祇有「赤手空拳」，那是很難「奮鬥到底」的，（過去的戰續，以及必俟雨季開始使意軍的飛機不能活動，不就是最好的說明嗎？）所以對于他們以「危亡民族名義，籲請英國人民，加以援助，俾克募集五百萬乃至六百萬鎊公債，以爲該國未被意軍佔領部份抗敵之用」，是寄與非常的同情和熱望，希望全世界正義的人士，能够對這「危亡民族」加以援手；他們說，「吾人目前並不請求他國出兵相助，亦不欲他國兵士，爲拯救我國獨立權之故，而輕流一滴鮮血，蘄求者，亦惟少許金錢作爲購買軍火之需，一有軍火之後，則其餘工作，均可由阿國戰士自爲之」！對這樣懇切悲壯的陳詞，對這樣可憐而又勇敢的民族，我們難道眞的看他們「戰至不剩一人」嗎？世界上的公理，難道眞的永遠在强權的手裏嗎？</p>
<p>中國今日的命運是並不在阿比西尼亞之上的，阿國已準備背城借一的「一致决定」了，而我們呢？</p>
<p>阿國人的宣言使我們激動，也使我們確信：確信阿國不會亡！在血的敎訓中，我們看到了弱小民族所遭的必然的命運是如何？</p>
<p>我們要做的是：怎樣來「捍衛本國之獨立權！」</p>

<h3 id="c202">海濱 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>從寶山縣城的東門走了出來，我們眼前的境界很像突然地開朗了那末地，異樣的娛快而且新鮮的感覺，箭似的直射到腦海裹來了。一下子，淸新柔軟的海風，飄呀飄的蕩了過來——陰暗的黑影給駭跑了。給都市的煤烟閉塞了的心竅，也給這美麗而壯偉的大自然漸次地吹開了，吹開了。</p>
<p>孩時的脾性又發作，帶點狂態地忘形奔上了這臨江的堤壩。無法形容的怡悅把自己從一切都站脫了出來，父給大自然的母親了。作算這也是一件大罪過，自己也許可以甘受不韙的。</p>
<p>心底嘶出了吼聲——大自然的母親阿！你怎末不洶湧你的浪潮，洗滌了這人世間的一切醜惡，和淹沒了這不合理的舊的社會哩？願意你響應着這千萬正義感的人們底心聲吧，他們急切地需要你的鼓勵，他們願意翻捲起這時代的暴風！</p>
<p>浪濤拍出到崖岸時的雄姿，是很足以感動人的情緒的。和巨石們掙扎的浪花，給逼榨得迸散開去四周，遝是表現得那挺神氣的。衝去戰鬥時的戰聲——那「嘩啦嘩啦啦——沙！」的呼號，是活像那千萬被壓迫者迸出那最後的吼聲：雄壯且駐破敵人的胆。</p>
<p>這兒是吳淞口，黃浦江出海的地方。面前是白濛濛的一太片，遠處也全看不見邊際。在極目的地方，有一綫綫灰色的細條便隔成了兩個海——千變萬化着的雲海，和洶湧着的浪潮。在這粗綫條的圖畫裏，也有幾點幽雅的，也是淸高的帆影，在點綴着。有時，在看國畫的時候，總覺得他們點上幾點帆影是附庸風雅，是有意地把晝和現實隔絕。這觀念到現在才算自己否認了，不過我並不是說國畫裏的帆影得當，相反地我不過在讚歎着這和大自然掙持的小生物的勇敢。由此和那淘湧着的浪潮配起來，並不是矛盾的，而是調和的，相互輝映着這「力」的美。</p>
<p>是一個陰天。沒有太陽。也沒有暴風。然而，不知憑一股什麼力，潮頭像千萬人的臂膀聯成一氣似的，伸着他的巨掌，聳高着，昂然地表示他的憤恨！—那抑壓了不知若干年代的憤恨，那從千萬人心底裏迸發出來的憤恨！</p>
<p>「放勇敢些吧，年靑人！</p>
<p>憑着我們千萬人的力量啊，</p>
<p>去撕碎了陳舊的，</p>
<p>憑着我們千萬人的力量啊，</p>
<p>再來創造那新的！………」</p>
<p>在大自然的母親底鼓舞下，我是這樣地狂歌了。</p>
<p>當我的旅伴告訴我，送我們的朋友已別了我們轉回寶山城裏了時，我才稍爲醒過來了一些時候。到這時候，我才明白我遝是處着在這混噩的社會裏，然而又是使我高興的，便是我記起：在這悠長的忍受的旅途中，我再不寂寞了，我不單止找到了旅伴，同時那還不是一個是千萬個。於是，握緊了我這個朋友的手，我們用快步進行的調子，帶着歡樂，也帶着喜悅，堅毅地踏上了我們這一個小小的旅程了。</p>
<p>我們兩個，大家都這樣地允諾了：是沿着這海濱走，直至到達吳淞鎭，才換船。這個小小的步行，約莫是需要五六十分鐘的，，也許還超過這個數目。在這個時候裏我們便和這嘶吼着的海作伴，直至我們給無情的環境逼迫着離開了它。</p>
<p>在這些時候裏是很可寶貴的。我們珍重它，我們不想半點兒浪費它，我們甚至不願意在無謂的交談裏過去了它。因此，在這些時候裹，我們把我們的全身心都交托了給我們的母親——這奇偉而洶動着的海了。也就是說，便是我們的心底跳躍，也是跟隨着浪潮的拍擊而拍擊着的。</p>
<p>關於海濱的愛好，在年靑的我已不算得是一件奇景了。曾經我有過斷斷續續地，也近兩年的海上的生活；倚着在海濱活着的時日，從孩時算起也不知多少時日了。光是關於海濱的故事也不知有過多少，這時候也不能記一個詳盡，我願意有一個機會給我把那些美麗的也是平凡的海濱的故事講一個痛快。然而，時光有時是很殘酷的，在我還沒有對這海和天吞一個飽的時侯，便逼着我又跨上了開往大都市的小火車了。它拖着我一步一步地遠離了我所愛好的境界，而又把我擲進生活的熔爐。</p>
<p>我懷慕着這一次的海行，我渴望着那我們已整個地自由了的那第二次。</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>龍舟的慘劇</p>
<p>五月節又來到了人間，生在半熱帶的南方人又狂熱地開始競賽龍舟了，在早兩天，哥哥呌我回家去一趟，可是我終是沒有去，我說：「有什麼用塲呢，鄉下只敎人討厭呀！」其實，我已答應了安妮，我跟她在省城看龍舟，她會像小孩子似的跳呀跳的，她生長在廣州，什麼都比我懂得多，所以，我不願意離開了省城，像一個飢餓的貓似地等候那奇怪的龍舟喜劇的來臨。</p>
<p>早上，太陽的火猛烈地燒着士敏士的馬路，整條馬路的店門都關得緊緊的。什麼人都過節了，是紀念屈原的日子呀！可是，人間已成了迷信的習慣，五月節是什麼意義都沒有多少人知道呢！</p>
<p>跑出馬路就看見陸上的龍舟在乒乒乓乓的響個不停，一條長長的龍，那花花綠綠的顏色在白色的陽光下愰動着讓十多個人在牠的腹中乘着走，那樣子多麼傲視地擺扭着——這是龍哪！可是，滿街都看到，倒有點兒呌我看得頭昏起來了。</p>
<p>安妮跟我到那世外桃源似的沙面去——那是帝國主義者的租界呀！那一天，好像戒嚴地拒絕了許多穿得不像上等人的人們進去，不過，我們終是跑了進去，在那蔭林的海岸綫上，像一個進了世外桃源的客人似地靠着椅子，吸受那新鮮的海風，在望着那一葉一葉的小舟在洶湧的白鵝潭面飄　。</p>
<p>「來了！你看，那三隻龍舟拼命地駛着過來了！」</p>
<p>安妮撅着小嘴指着在白色的浪花上飛也似的飄來的龍舟，牠們在賽快，鑼鼓聲，呌聲，喧天搗海似的，那樣子就像三匹瘋了的龍似的在咆哮着，我的心靈也給壓得急急的了。</p>
<p>忽然，我們看見一隻不大不小的電輪在遠處飛也似的駛進白鵝潭面來，那瘋狂的樣子，就很能證明牠是載滿了「猛野」（有權威的人們）來的，也許是來看龍舟喜劇的人們吧，可是，這隻電船却不顧一切的向這邊的龍舟身上奔衝過來，那樣子呌人心靈驚盪，眞是可怕得很的：</p>
<p>「嘆！萊！你看，白鵝潭的浪正洶湧得很呢！」</p>
<p>安妮的眼珠子很顯明的是憂鬱而害怕起來了。</p>
<p>我屏着呼吸，我完全志記了我爲什麼在海濱上死定定地站着望着呢，我更害怕聽那可怕的哀嗚了：</p>
<p>「喂！避呀！避呀！」</p>
<p>這是從龍舟上發出的吼聲，可是，已來不及了，那電船已逼近了小小的龍舟的身邊，兩邊都由焦急轉到咆哮了，可是，那電船究竟是傲慢的，還是不避開的奔衝過來，那龍舟上的人壓不住憤怒地用舉起了槳，又不能不顧慮到在巨浪裏搖擺的小舟身，在喧罵的聲中，我們聽到而且看到，從電船上發出了槍聲，貼近電船的一隻龍舟上的人倒下水裏去，在怒狂的濤裏，一隻龍舟翻了一個身，五十多個人這樣地覆沒在白鵝潭的水裏去了。</p>
<p>電船還是平安地駛到市裏去，我們的眼珠子却看着那慘劇，眼也昏花起來了。</p>
<p>「呀！這樣野蠻的世界呀！」</p>
<p>安妮的眼珠子濕潤起來了。她望着我，又望着靑色的天空，天空的太陽正在閃着光彩的照射着白鵝潭的海面，白色的浪花還沒有一點變態地在飄，海面依然淸凉地襲在我們的身上。可是，我的臉却垂下去，不敢再看那浪花了。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，我們從報紙上看到這一段新聞：</p>
<p>「電船載霍某家屬往省看龍舟，因與龍舟正面衝撞，龍舟覆沒，死者三十餘人！」</p>
<p>我看了，我的心又更不愉服地起着浪花：「爲什麼報紙不能多說一句話呢！爲什麼這樣平靜的呢！」</p>
<p>安妮用手封着我的嘴巴，意思是不必去說，我感嘆地閉上眼睛了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Second Plenary Session Opens, Homage Paid at Mausoleum Before Preparatory Meeting, Chiang, Sun, and Nine Others Form Presidium, First General Assembly Held Today <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Plenary Session held a homage ceremony at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and opening ceremony at 6:00 AM on the 10th. Central Committee members went by car to attend before dawn. The mausoleum area was heavily guarded, and order was excellent. Attendees included Vice Chairman Chiang, Central Committee members Lin Sen, Feng Yuxiang, Sun Ke, Tang Shaoyi, Wu Jingheng, Cai Yuanpei, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Bai Wenwei, Xia Douyin, He Yingqin, Yu Hanmou, Chu Minyi, Chen Bijun, Shang Zhen, Li Xiaoqing, Chen Panling, Wang Chonghui, Zhao Dihua, Yu Jingtang, Luo Jialun, Xiong Shihui, Yang Yongtai, Yu Xuezhong, Pang Bingxun, Sun Lianzhong, He Siyuan, Ouyang Ge, Maisi Wude, Li Wenfan, Zhou Bomin, He Zhonghan, Zeng Yangfu, and others, totaling about 200 people. At 6:00 AM sharp, music was played and the ceremony began. Chairman Lin Sen led the ceremony, offered a wreath, and delivered an opening address. After Lin finished his report, he led all the Central Committee members in single file to the tomb to pay respects to the remains before returning to their places. The music ended, and the ceremony concluded. The members then returned to the city by car to hold a preparatory meeting at the Central Party Headquarters. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The preparatory meeting of the Second Plenary Session on the 10th has decided on the members of the Presidium and the Secretary-General. The Presidium held a meeting after the preparatory meeting adjourned to exchange views and decide on the agenda for the first general assembly. The afternoon of the 10th was a half-day break, and the first general assembly was scheduled to be held at 7:00 AM on the 11th. Sun Ke was elected as the chairman of the first general assembly. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) With the opening of the Second Plenary Session, the dispute between the Central Government and the Southwest region is expected to be resolved politically. The Southwest side faces an impending internal collapse, as part of its air force returns to the Central Government, and Yu Hanmou and Li Hanhun are also preparing to submit to the Central Government. Furthermore, public opinion has abandoned its sympathy for the Southwest. They have no choice but to use the Second Plenary Session as an opportunity to seek a compromise with the Central Government. The Central Government seems confident in guiding the conference to a favorable outcome. (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Lin Sen's Opening Address <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of Chairman Lin Sen's opening address at the Second Plenary Session is as follows: "Gentlemen, comrades, today marks the opening of the Fifth Central Committee's Second Plenary Session. The Central Committee had originally planned to hold a general meeting every six months. It has now been six months since the First Plenary Session was held, so we have scheduled the Second Plenary Session to begin today. At this moment, our nation is facing many difficulties, which is also the most challenging time for our work for the Party and the country. We must work even harder to overcome these difficulties. Because we know that the nation's position is not yet fully stable, we must strive to make the nation's position equal to others internationally. At the very least, we must first put our internal politics on the right track. To put politics on the right track, we must first have a political system that allows it to exert its power. In other words, we must absolutely unify political power. After unification, we can naturally exert great strength. Everyone must unite and concentrate all their power in the Central Government. Only in this way can we have a clear direction both domestically and internationally. If one side cannot unite, it will lead to fragmentation. When everyone is scattered in different places, there is no strength, because scattering leads to division, and division leads to weakness. This is a certain principle. If we can unite, unification means concentration, and concentration naturally leads to great strength. Therefore, the most important thing for our comrades now is to be sincerely united, with one heart and one mind, to follow the teachings of the late Premier, and to strive forward. Then, no matter how difficult the future may be, no matter what obstacles there may be, we will surely be able to overcome them. If we cannot unite and our wills diverge, the future will be very dangerous. If everyone sees this clearly, they will surely awaken and, with one heart and one mind, uphold the Party's principles, abide by discipline, unite, and generate great strength, so that we can have a clear direction externally and enable the people to live and work in peace internally. Today, we are holding the opening ceremony of the Second Plenary Session. We have gathered the Party's leading figures and responsible comrades from various regions to discuss the Party's and the nation's policies together.

<h3 id="e6">A Certain Important Figure in the Ministry of Finance Discusses: Guangdong Province's Excessive Issuance of Paper Currency <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Refuses to Promote the Central Government's Legal Tender, Tang Haian's Negotiations Have Yet to Yield Any Results</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the recent dispatch of Feng Rui, the Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of Guangdong Province, to Nanjing to discuss the issue of paper currency, Minister Kong, after meeting with him, sent Tang Haian, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, to Guangdong with Feng to discuss everything. Many days have passed, and there are no results. The outside world is paying close attention. On the 10th, a reporter visited a certain important figure in the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the process and results. The reply was as follows: "In recent years, the authorities in Guangdong Province have always implemented the central government's policies that are beneficial to them, and ignored those that are not. The legal tender policy is no exception. Since the central government promulgated the legal tender policy in November last year, all provinces have successively implemented it, except for Guangdong Province, which initially hesitated and refused to accept the order, and then adopted the name of legal tender but carried out the reality of excessively issuing paper currency. The central government has been very cautious about the issuance of legal tender. For every yuan of legal tender issued, it is backed by reserves, and the Issuance Reserve Management Committee checks the amount of issuance and the actual situation of the reserves every month and announces it at any time. Therefore, since its implementation, the credit has been obvious, and the foreign exchange rate is also very stable. Chinese and foreign people have praised its convenience. The so-called legal tender in Guangdong Province is the silver dollar notes issued by the provincial and municipal banks of the province as legal tender, but the genuine legal tender issued by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is refused to circulate. This method is already inappropriate. At the same time, the Guangdong branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee organized by the central government is also not accepted, because this way, it can be free from the restrictions of 40% cash reserve and can excessively issue paper currency. Therefore, the cash reserves in Guangdong Province are 70 million silver dollars and 20 million silver dollars, totaling only more than 90 million yuan, but the paper currency issued has exceeded 200 million yuan. According to the 60% cash reserve that should be paid for issuing legal tender, there is a difference of more than 30 million yuan. Therefore, the low credit of its silver notes and the soaring foreign exchange rate are inevitable results. Guangdong Province has the earliest transportation with overseas countries, and its industry and commerce have always been developed. The amount of remittances from overseas Chinese back to China is also the largest, which is quite related to our country's overall international balance of payments. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the people have suffered a lot due to the repeated excessive issuance of paper currency in Guangdong Province. After the implementation of the so-called silver dollar legal tender this time, the financial situation has been shaken and industry and commerce have also been affected due to insufficient reserves and unstable credit. Even the remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased a lot. If it is not remedied quickly, not only will the legal tender policy not be unified, but the social economy and the people's livelihood will suffer losses. The central government has always been lenient towards all measures taken by the authorities in Guangdong Province. Recently, there have been changes in Guangdong Province, and the central government believes that the legal tender issue is of great importance to the economy of the people in Guangdong Province, so it has repeatedly sent personnel to persuade and negotiate, hoping that they will follow the central government's methods. This is to unify the legal tender and relieve the people's suffering, and it will not stop because of the ambitions of one or two authorities. Therefore, when Feng Rui came, he immediately ordered important personnel from the three banks to discuss concrete measures with him in good faith, and sent Tang Haian to accompany Feng Rui back to Guangdong to handle the matter. However, the authorities in the province are obsessed with private interests. Tang and Feng have been gone for several days, and there has been no formal response yet. However, news has come that the authorities in the province will sell the existing cash reserves of silver notes to foreign businessmen through Yang Jianping, and there is also talk of continuing to increase the issuance of silver notes. If this is true, the silver notes will surely become waste paper in the future. The central government is very distressed to hear this news, but it still hopes that the authorities in Guangdong Province will handle things carefully and not let the people of Guangdong fall into dire straits, which would be a great fortune. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Legal Tender Management Committee has decided to transport 100 million yuan of silver reserves to Hong Kong for storage. Shen Zaihe was sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with a major bank for storage, which has been agreed upon. The silver will be transported to Hong Kong immediately. (Special dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Referendum and International Disputes <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since Mr. Graese stirred up a huge wave in Geneva regarding the Danzig issue, feelings in Berlin have suddenly become tense. In recent days, there have been many advocates for resolving the fate of Danzig through a referendum. According to reports from Havas, the diplomatic circles in Berlin have expressed their opinions on the current situation in Danzig, saying that the current system in the area may be changed through a referendum. If this move is realized, Germany can win, just like the referendum in the Saar region in January last year. Even Mr. Sandys, a Conservative Party member in London, advocated holding a referendum in the Free City of Danzig to determine the future of the Free City.</p>
<p>A referendum was originally the most common method used in the Treaty of Versailles to express national self-determination. Border disputes between Germany and Denmark, the Upper Silesia issue between Poland and Germany, the border between Belgium and Germany, and the border between Austria and Yugoslavia and Hungary were all resolved through referendums to determine the ownership of the territories. Danzig was made a free city to preserve Poland's interests, regardless of the will of the local residents. Among the 170,000 people in Danzig, Poles account for only 10%. If the principle of national self-determination had been applied in the Treaty of Versailles, there is no doubt that this free port would have belonged to Germany. Now the National Socialist Party is reiterating this principle, wanting to make Danzig what it made the Saar. In theory, this is not without basis.</p>
<p>However, can a referendum really fundamentally resolve international disputes? In fact, it is not easy to give a definite answer. From the perspective of economic relations, this method is particularly unsuitable for Danzig, because Danzig is Poland's natural seaport and the region where Germans flourish. Commentators say that a referendum has the following drawbacks: 1. Nearby residents invade the disputed area, and the local garrison takes sides and threatens, making it impossible for one side of the people to express their opinions. 2. Neutral troops are also inevitably biased towards one side. For example, in the referendum in Upper Silesia, the British army sided with the Germans, and the French army sided with the Poles. 3. Fierce propaganda is carried out before the vote, and both sides cannot live in peace, and the minority people suffer even more oppression after the decision. 4. People's voting is often driven by temporary interests and have no time to consider the future and eternal welfare, which can easily lead to regret. 5. They can only choose one of the two options, left or right, and there is no possibility of expressing other opinions. It is not their wish to follow Jin or Chu, and the true opinions cannot be expressed. 6. The distribution of people is very complex, and obtaining an appropriate boundary will inevitably sacrifice the interests of the minority, and the serious problem of ethnic minorities will arise. These six are the weaknesses of the referendum and cannot be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>The greatest difficulty in a referendum lies in the economic problem. The political interests and the economic interests are often inconsistent. Politically, the German people of Danzig should be under the banner of the National Socialist Party. Economically, the day Danzig returns to Germany is the day Danzig's economy goes bankrupt. Someone said that "the flag of a Danzig who has seen his motherland again has become a corpse." Although the words are too much, they also have great truth. The Vistula River is the river of the Polish people. If the Polish people are unwilling to use Danzig as the distribution center for their products, then the docks, warehouses, banks, and insurance companies will be lonely and have no customers. Moreover, the power of commerce in cities such as Warsaw and Krakow is mostly controlled by Jews. Do Jews want a Danzig ruled by the National Socialist Party to prosper? Anyone who knows the long-standing hatred between the National Socialist Party and the Jews can answer this. Therefore, national self-determination can solve the political problem of Danzig, but it cannot solve the economic problem of Danzig. The permanent elimination of international disputes seems to require a more fundamental method.</p>

<p>Wang Only Generally Discussed Economic Issues During the Meetings; Sino-Japanese Cooperation Must Benefit Both Sides Before It Can Proceed</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Kemin said, "I left Beiping in September. This time, I came to Tianjin and Beiping to visit old friends. Song Zheyuan is an old friend, and I met with him yesterday. Song expressed his hope that I would help. I am old and have eye problems, so staying here may not be helpful. If there are any consultations, I will certainly offer my opinions. However, if I am to be responsible for a specific task, I am afraid I will make mistakes. Regarding the issue of economic cooperation, I met with Ambassador Kawagoe in Shanghai. He expressed that Japan has no intention of invading China and that it is necessary to adjust the relations between the two countries. Because political issues are complex, he intends to start with the economic aspect. I met with Commander Tashiro in Tianjin, and with Counselor Shimizu and Secretary Hanamura in Beiping. What we discussed was the same. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, if it is beneficial to both countries, should be feasible. However, I have not heard of any specific plans. I plan to go to Tianjin on the 11th and then return south after a short stay. If necessary, I can come to Beiping again in the future. I may meet with Tashiro again in Tianjin." (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Kemin told reporters on the morning of the 10th, "I have been away from Beiping for more than half a year. I came here to take care of family matters and visit friends. I met with Chairman Song on the afternoon of the 9th. In addition to generally discussing the overall situation, regarding the issue of developing the economy of North China, Song hoped that I would be responsible for presiding over it. Because I am old and especially have poor eyesight, I am afraid I cannot be competent for such a large problem, so I immediately expressed that I dared not accept the assignment. If help is needed, I am very willing to assist from the sidelines. This is the actual situation of my meeting with Song. I have met with Kawagoe and Tashiro in Shanghai and Tianjin. In Beiping, I also met with Hanamura and Shimizu. What we talked about with each other was also generally about economic issues. We did not talk about specific measures. Kawagoe once stated that China and Japan cannot be separated in politics, economics, and other aspects. However, because the political aspect is more complicated, Sino-Japanese cooperation should start with economics first. I believe that as long as economic cooperation is beneficial to both parties, it may be feasible. However, as far as I know, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is still under discussion and has not yet entered a specific path. I am scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 11th or visit Tashiro again. I will stay for one or two days and then return to Shanghai. In the future, if necessary, I may come north again." (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan held another banquet for Wang Kemin at his residence at 6:00 PM on the 10th, inviting Qin Dechun, Chen Juesheng, and others to accompany him. In addition to generally discussing the current situation, it was heard that Song had instructed Wang to convey the situation in North China to the Central Government and President Chiang after returning to Nanjing, and to explain the reason for his inability to attend the Second Plenary Session. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Song Zheyuan will give Wang Kemin the position of Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Political Affairs Committee. However, Wang claimed today that due to his physical condition, he can only be responsible for the role of advisor. Wang stated today when talking about the rumor that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita instructed Japanese officials in Beiping to "absolutely support Wang Kemin," that his trip to the north did not involve special suggestions or policies and that Arita's move was unnecessary. Regarding the economic development of North China, neither side has made formal proposals. However, he believes that any plan that is considered mutually beneficial to the economic development of North China will be realized by China and Japan. Wang also said that he met with Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe in Shanghai and felt that due to the complexity of Sino-Japanese political relations, the two sides must be closely aligned, and economic cooperation is the first step in adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Wang said that he plans to return south soon to report to the Nanjing authorities and is prepared to frequently travel back and forth between the north and south in the future. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Secretary Hanamura, according to the instructions of his province, visited Song Zheyuan at his private residence at 11:00 AM today to hear Song's opinion regarding Wang Kemin's trip to the north. He replied to Song that he had thoroughly discussed various domestic affairs issues in North China with Wang yesterday, and it was very smooth. Since I have repeatedly invited Wang to come north, I should fully listen to Wang's opinions and respect them. Specific matters were not discussed at that time. (10th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mr. Wang Kemin met with reporters at the Beijing Hotel at 1:00 PM today and gave a speech, saying, "I did not undertake any official mission on this trip to the north. Yesterday afternoon, I met with Song Zheyuan and earnestly discussed various issues in North China. The Hebei-Chahar political power has gradually developed into a sound entity. However, regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation and other important issues related to the development of the economy of North China, I think it would be more convenient for both parties to negotiate directly with the Nanjing government. I am scheduled to leave Beiping for Tianjin and return to Shanghai on the 11th to report to all parties concerned. Whether I will come north again has not yet been decided, because I am not in good health, and it is not the time for an old man to come forward." (10th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Matsumuro said that the Japanese army tank unit has been parading in Beiping city for the past two days for training and test driving, which has now ended. He has not yet met with Wang Kemin after he came north, but there have been instructions telegraphed to Beiping from Tokyo, ordering him to assist. Regarding the economic development of North China, both China and Japan are beneficial, and according to the current situation, it is indeed necessary. If Wang is willing to meet with me, I would welcome it. The rumor that the Japanese side has established a special agency in the Alxa League is not true. Imai's trip south is of a liaison nature, and there is a need for improvement in North China's politics. If the authorities make efforts, the Japanese side will definitely provide assistance. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The head of the special agency of the Japanese garrison army in North China, Matsumuro Takayoshi, when meeting with foreign correspondents today, was asked about the incident yesterday in which Japanese soldiers and tanks paraded in Beiping, and a photographer was treated badly by the Japanese army for trying to take pictures. Matsumuro replied that according to Japan's conservative military secrets law, no one in Japan can take pictures of tanks, and this military law also applies to this question. When someone pointed out that Beiping is Chinese territory, he said that the Japanese army has the right to use its military law to stop others from taking pictures of Japanese army tanks. Someone also suggested that if the Japanese army wants to keep the secrets of the tanks, it is better not to parade them. Then Matsumuro said, "Seeing the tank parade is not an obstacle, but no one is allowed to take pictures." Someone asked, "What right does the Japanese army have to take out the film of foreigners' photos?" Matsumuro replied, "Because foreigners took pictures of the Japanese army's tanks." Someone said, "In any case, Japanese military law cannot be applied in Beiping." Matsumuro said, "You must get the permission of the Japanese army, otherwise you are violating our will and hindering morality." However, Matsumuro initially refused to allow the correspondents to take pictures, saying that this matter must be decided by the Japanese army officer leading the parade. When answering other questions, Matsumuro said, "We have the right to protect the important military machinery of the country. According to my experience and feelings, I feel that foreigners in China and Japan pay too much attention to their rights and ignore the rights of the Japanese. This is the arrogance of the white people, and if it is not corrected, it will make it more difficult to maintain world peace." Someone asked about Wang Kemin's trip to the north. Matsumuro admitted that he had received instructions from Tokyo to assist Wang, saying that Wang is a supporter of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and his task will be to reorganize financial and economic matters. Matsumuro concluded that the Japanese people's wish in North China is for genuine economic development and a peaceful situation. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fischer, a reporter for the Associated Press stationed in Beiping, was interfered with while taking pictures of the Japanese army parade, and his camera was also destroyed. Two representatives of the Japanese garrison army here apologized verbally to the Associated Press in Chinese and Japanese today, saying that these soldiers had just arrived from Japan, and taking military photos is generally not allowed in Japan. They have not yet fully understood that they are in a foreign country, so this happened. Fischer also expressed his thanks to them and hoped that the Japanese army would not overstep its authority in the future. The Japanese army representatives said that they would comply, and before leaving, they gave Fischer a box of new photographic dry plates as compensation. (10th National Telegram)</p>

"Joining the party without asking about virtue or ignorance, right or wrong, but only killing and looting, is called thoroughness, but it is not even as good as bandits." "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the creeds for stabilizing society and must be practiced by oneself. This is also the way to save the country from danger."

<p>Guangdong and Guangxi Armies Entering Hunan Have Completely Withdrawn; He Will Obey the Central Government in Everything Regarding the Current Situation</p>
<p>(Hankou) When He Jian passed through Hankou, he gave a speech to our reporter, saying, "I have no proposals to make during this trip to Beijing to attend the Second Plenary Session. I must visit President Chiang in Beijing to report on the military and political affairs of Hunan, and I will return to Hunan after the meeting." "Guangdong and Guangxi, under the guise of resisting Japan, deployed troops in southern Hunan. Chen, Li, Bai, and others once telegraphed to request passage to the north, and I immediately reported to the Central Government and sent a telegram to dissuade them." "The Guangdong and Guangxi armies that entered southern Hunan were the Guangdong army in Chenzhou and the Guangxi army Xia Wei's department in Yongqi. There was no conflict with the garrison troops. Liao Lei also did not invade. As of the 20th of last month, the Guangxi army entering Hunan had completely withdrawn, and there is not a single soldier in Hunan." "When the Guangdong and Guangxi armies entered Hunan, the public security and finance of Hunan Province were slightly affected, but they have now completely returned to their original state." "The people's hearts in Guilin have been shaken recently, and fortifications have been stepped up. Foreign missionaries have all left, and it seems that there is still an intention to prepare for war. However, the Central Army has not entered Guangxi. Finally, when reporters inquired about his opinions on the current situation and whether he had a plan to bring to Beijing, He replied with a solemn attitude, saying that whether the current situation can be resolved politically will depend on the final decision of the Central Government and whether Guangdong and Guangxi can realize their mistakes. It is difficult to speculate at this time. Hunan only knows to support the Central Government, maintain peace and unity, and obey the orders of the Central Government in everything. As for the rumors that Muren intends to have a plan to resolve the current situation, it must also wait for the Central Government to decide." (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

The area usually has a monthly income of 300,000 yuan, but the Hebei East Government has been deducting 250,000 yuan per month recently. Coupled with the sales of smuggled salt, the tax revenue in the second half of the year is unlikely to be promising. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the water situation of the Yangtze River this year, reporters visited the person in charge of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission on the 10th for inquiries. According to them, the water level this year is higher because of the heavy rainfall in spring. In May, it is most similar to the trend in 1931. However, by the beginning of June, it gradually stabilized and there was no sign of a high rise. Among the tributaries, only the Xiang River had a slight surge in late May, but it was more than five meters higher or lower than the highest last year. The flood season of Dongting and Poyang began in late May and early June. At present, the Yangtze River mainstream between Hankou and Yueyang is about seven meters lower than the highest water level and about eight meters lower than the top of the levee.

The area between Wuhu and Nanjing is about two meters lower than the highest water level and about three meters lower than the top of the levee.

<p>(London) The Admiralty has begun today to withdraw the main fleet stationed in the Mediterranean. However, the Mediterranean fleet will be stronger than before the Italian-Abyssinian War. Several of the withdrawing ships will head to the Far East. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The government suddenly decided to redeploy the main fleet currently stationed in Gibraltar. Political figures explained that recent rumors suggested that if the British main fleet did not return to its original defense and the mutual assistance agreements of the Mediterranean countries were not revoked, Italy would refuse to participate in the Montreux Conference and future Locarno Conference. The government feared that Italy might issue a formal note to Britain at any moment, stating this intention. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw the fleet automatically as a preemptive measure. It was also stated that the government now believes that the dangers that Germany might pose are more significant than the Italian issue. It is imperative to redeploy the fleet to the North Sea for defense, which also provides clear evidence of this. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Government officials here were very pleased to hear that the British government had decided to redeploy the main fleet currently stationed in the Mediterranean back to its original defense. They stated that to clarify the international situation, all sanction-related measures should be revoked first. Italy has long held this view and has never changed. Officials are still silent about the future trend of Italian foreign policy and refuse to comment on whether Italy will participate in the Montreux Conference and future Locarno Conference. They only stated that they would clarify after the British fleet has indeed withdrawn. Some optimists said that after the British main fleet is redeployed to its original defense, the Italian troops stationed in Libya, North Africa, will soon be recalled to Italy. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the impending redeployment of the fleet stationed in the Mediterranean, official sources recently announced that the Mediterranean countries (excluding Britain and Italy) had previously signed a mutual assistance agreement based on Section 3 of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. This agreement will not be affected in any way by the withdrawal of British warships. (Note: This section states that "The Members of the League agree that, when financial or economic measures are taken in accordance with this Article, they will mutually support one to another in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting therefrom, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.")

<p>Mediterranean Fleet Redeployed to China</p>
<p>(London) The British warships that hastily sailed from the Far East to the Mediterranean when the Italian-Abyssinian War broke out have now been relieved of their special duties and will soon sail back to their original defense in China. This action follows the British government's decision to reduce the strength of the British Mediterranean Fleet to normal levels. It is reported that the original defense in China will maintain full naval strength and may even be slightly increased. Two escape-ocean ships and four submarines will return to the Far East within days. Four D-class destroyers will sail from Aden to the Far East. The cruiser "Cumberland," formerly belonging to the British fleet in China, has been extensively refurbished at a cost of £561,000. Its appearance has undergone significant modifications. It will sail to China again in September to replace the cruiser Cornwall, which will arrive here on July 14. The new Australian cruiser Sydney, after being launched in Britain, sailed to the Mediterranean due to the emergency there. It will now sail to Australia, where Australians will see it for the first time. The accelerated progress of British defense programs will have a steadying effect on the European continent. As for its funding, the budget has stipulated an additional £25,600,000 for defense, so the new bill only exceeds the expected amount by £4,000,000. All funds will be used domestically, and most of it will return to the treasury. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The government has decided to redeploy the warships stationed in the Mediterranean to their original defense. The names of these warships and their fleet affiliations are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Belonging to the Main Fleet stationed in Gibraltar: Battleships "Nelson" and "Rodney" (both 34,000 tons), three 7,000-ton cruisers: "Orion," "Leander," and "Neptune," aircraft carrier "Furious," nine 2,000-ton destroyers: "Campbell," "Comet," "Crescent," "Bedouin," "Wessex," "Codrington," "Vega," "Gallant," nine 1,500-ton destroyers: "Falknor," "Fearless," "Fortune," "Fame," "Forester," "Firedrake," "Foxhound," "Foresight," "Fury," nine submarines: "Titian," "Seawolf," "Seal," "Shark," "Swordfish," "Oberon," "L23," "L26," "L27."</p>

<p>(Paris) The mutual assistance measures previously agreed upon by Britain and France have been declared invalid by the French government. The details are as follows: Earlier this week, the Italian government notified the French cabinet that since the League of Nations General Assembly had announced the lifting of sanctions, the mutual assistance measures previously agreed upon by Britain and France in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant would be regarded as an act of opposition by the Italian government if they were still maintained. The French authorities replied that the above-mentioned mutual assistance measures had been decided to be revoked several weeks ago. Until yesterday, it was decided to notify the British government of the exchange of documents between the two parties. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources recently announced that after France declared the mutual assistance measures between Britain and France regarding the Mediterranean invalid yesterday, the counselor of the Turkish Embassy visited officials in the Foreign Office this morning to inquire about the matter. The official replied that whether the mutual assistance measures between Britain and France were invalid or not, the mutual assistance measures previously established by the Balkan countries would continue to be effective. Political figures explained that Britain now wants to resolve the Mediterranean issue completely and involve Italy, so that the original mutual assistance measures of Britain and France can become a general convention.

<h3 id="e34">Disagreement on Key Issues; Montreux Conference Reaches Impasse <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Britain Guarantees Not to Hinder Regional Mutual Assistance Conventions; Resolutely Opposes Black Sea Fleet Sailing into Mediterranean; Representatives Return Home for Instructions; General Assembly to Reconvene on Monday</p>
<p>Montreux The Montreux Conference has again reached an impasse due to the failure to resolve several important issues. (The conference was adjourned once last month.) Work can only continue after the governments of the relevant countries have stated their positions. It has been decided to hold a plenary session next Monday (the 13th). Many representatives from the relevant countries have now returned home for instructions. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu left for home yesterday. British representative Lytton also returned to London yesterday morning and will return here next Monday. French Chief Delegate Poncet held talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and British Chief Delegate Lord Stanley separately and is scheduled to return home this afternoon. During the meeting with Stanley, Poncet immediately gave a guarantee that Britain has no intention of hindering the right of signatory countries to communicate with each other regarding the various constraints of all regional conventions (such as the Balkan Entente, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty) that are to be added to the treaty for the purpose of maintaining a peaceful situation, whether in the Near East or other places. What Britain firmly insists on is that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet should not be allowed to freely enter the Mediterranean to unite with the Baltic Sea Fleet. Poncet expressed satisfaction with this guarantee, believing that Article 23 of the British draft (i.e., the one concerning regional conventions) can be revised to create a compromise. In addition, Britain and France have reached a consensus on the following two issues: The Straits Commission should continue to exist. Although Turkey has expressed opposition, the general nature of the agreement will not be hindered as a result. Regarding the issue of airplanes flying over the Straits, although Turkey has agreed to propose amendments to allow airplanes of all countries to pass through the Straits, they will not be allowed to fly over fortified areas. However, this statement is considered empty. It will require continued efforts from the representatives of the relevant countries to hope for a compromise. The points on which the relevant countries have mutually agreed are being drafted into a convention by the legal experts of each country, so that they can be completed before the plenary session next Monday. In addition, regarding Italy's participation in the conference, the delegations of the relevant countries expressed pessimism, believing that although Britain will withdraw the main fleet from the Mediterranean back to its original defense and France has decided to cancel the mutual assistance measures, Italy still has no hope of sending representatives to attend. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Montreux Observers believe that the situation at the Montreux Conference shows that the relevant countries still have disagreements on two issues: The Soviet Union's demand that its fleet should have the right to freely pass through the Straits, whether in wartime or peacetime. The Soviet Union's amendment to Article 16 of the British proposal (which advocates that the Black Sea should remain open in wartime), demanding that the Black Sea be closed in wartime, but that the fleets of all countries should be allowed to pass through freely if they are fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant or regional conventions to deal with aggressor countries. Regarding the first issue, the British delegation has requested instructions from its government and will likely answer with "difficult to comply," because if the Soviet fleet stationed in the Black Sea is allowed to freely pass through the Straits to unite with the Baltic Sea Fleet, Germany would be unhappy, and the provisions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement would also be hindered. Regarding the second issue, well-informed sources recently announced that Britain will likely agree, but according to the opinions of its experts, it must be accompanied by a condition: if Turkey is attacked for fulfilling regional conventions, Britain does not have to provide assistance and can stay out of it in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. (Note: This section states that "If the report by the Council is not unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.") (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Four Main Difficulties</p>
<p>Montreux Observers here recently stated that the difficulties currently encountered at the Montreux Conference can ultimately be resolved. The main difficulties are four: The Soviet Union firmly insists that various warships, even those of medium tonnage, should not be allowed to pass through the Straits. The warships of so-called medium tonnage clearly refer to the German pocket battleships of 10,000 tons. The Soviet Union demands that its navy, when sailing from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean, should have complete freedom without restrictions. The Soviet Union advocates that the Black Sea should be closed in wartime, and that no warships should be allowed to pass through, except for those fulfilling mutual assistance obligations. The Soviet Union demands that its warships should have the right to freely pass through the Straits when implementing regional agreements, such as the Balkan Entente or the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. Among these, the last one is the most complex, and France has already supported it. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Romanian Representative Accuses British Policy of Contradiction</p>
<p>Montreux Today, when the Dardanelles Straits Conference considered the Russian representative's amendments to the British draft, a dispute arose between the British delegation and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. The Soviet amendments stated that the convention should not infringe upon the rights and obligations of the contracting countries as members of the League of Nations and should maintain the freedom of warships engaged in auxiliary defense against aggressors, either under the League Covenant or under supplementary treaties concluded within the League framework, to pass through the Straits. When the British representative explained his views, Titulescu was not present, but after arriving, he demanded a restatement of Britain's position. He then accused the British delegation, saying, "You advocate one policy in Geneva, and another policy here. You are trying to undermine mutual assistance and regional agreements." British Under-Secretary of State Cadogan replied that, out of courtesy, he intended to explain Britain's views, but that Titulescu's accusations were unfounded. Titulescu then rose again and said, "This is not a matter of courtesy. You are endangering the agreements between my country and France and the Balkan countries." After the meeting, Titulescu immediately took a train back to his country, as there seemed to be a dispute within the Romanian cabinet. The British delegation did not reject the Soviet proposal, but the difficulties that the conference will cause, this proposal will certainly be supported by France and the Balkan countries. The next plenary meeting is scheduled to be held next Monday. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Turkey Should Have Full Authority Over the Straits</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey Nati, a member of parliament, recently made a statement to the semi-official newspaper "Cumhuriyet" regarding the Straits issue, saying that the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits should be under the full authority of Turkey, without any restrictions. Regarding this case, Turkey's attitude is very moderate. Those who accuse it of closing its doors and not engaging in trade with the civilized world are not justified. Any country that wants to obtain the right of free passage through the Straits, Turkey should have the means to deal with it. Therefore, the Straits issue will no longer be a pending case. As for which countries the Straits should be closed to and which countries they should be open to, Turkey also knows how to plan. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Opposition Party's Impeachment of Government Rejected</p>
<p>(Paris) During today's House of Representatives meeting, the opposition questioned the government about supplying the Soviet Union with secret designs for new anti-aircraft guns, and submitted this as an impeachment motion. After the vote, it was rejected by a vote of 378 to 10. The anti-aircraft gun in question is said to be capable of firing 800 rounds per minute and was invented by a Swiss national working in a private factory. Currently, the French army only has six of these guns. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During the House of Representatives meeting yesterday, right-wing member Grillis questioned Aviation Minister Côte, saying that the machine guns previously equipped on French military aircraft could only fire 400 rounds per minute. Now a new type of machine gun, "No. 23," fires a large number of bullets. The Ministry of Aviation is said to have supplied its designs to the Soviet Union. What is the intention? Aviation Minister Côte replied at today's House of Representatives meeting, stating that the government is willing to provide military assistance to all countries that have mutual assistance treaties with France. This move is not only beneficial to France but can also promote sales of French-made weapons, so that friendly countries do not have to rely on Germany. In short, the French military industry has always supplied weapons to foreign countries and has also purchased foreign patent certificates to manufacture new types of equipment. It is especially necessary to adopt reciprocal measures for friendly countries. Côte refused to explain what military or technical items the Soviet Union had supplied to France. He also criticized Grillis's motion, saying that it could cause foreign countries to misunderstand and believe that France and Russia had concluded a secret treaty in addition to the mutual assistance treaty. In fact, "France and Russia have not concluded a military alliance treaty." The House of Representatives finally passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 403 to 162.

<h3 id="e39">The Turmoil in Spain (Part 1) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Authored by Louis Fisher, translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>Spain clearly needs to find a way to alleviate her poverty and backwardness. Farmers and urban workers are demanding better living conditions. When the reactionary right-wingers were in power, they only responded to these demands with terror; thus, most Spaniards realized that the reactionaries no longer had the strength or the qualification to continue ruling the country.</p>
<p>The reactionary right-wing includes the large landowners, the Church, imperialists, and a few large industrialists. They are declining, shrinking, and disorganized. Their main hope at present is to obtain the assistance of the army and the Civil Guard to carry out a violent coup d'état. This kind of conspiracy is enough to show their loss of power. As a result, the left has obtained an unprecedented opportunity. On February 6, 1936, the United Front of the radicals finally achieved the final victory. Although the Communist Party refused to assume administrative responsibility, it finally gave support and maintenance to the minority cabinet of the left-wing bourgeois Republicans under the leadership of Azaña.</p>
<p>Manuel Azaña is an interesting figure in an interesting environment. Spain really needs a revolution to transform her national economy. Azaña hoped to achieve this revolution through evolution or democratic methods. Although socialists and communists watched with suspicion, they did not withdraw their support. The reasons for this were twofold: the overthrow of Azaña might lead to the restoration of right-wing rule, and they believed that Azaña's actions were paving the way for them. Azaña did not think so. He did not want to be Kerensky. He wanted to create a new and special category for Spain that neither coincided with Fascism or Bolshevism, nor was the same as the established forms of capitalism. He once said to me: "I want an extremely left-wing republic with some socialist reforms."</p>
<p>Although Azaña was not a socialist, he repeatedly mentioned to me "socialist reforms," "collective agriculture," and "the nationalization of land without compensation." The fact is that many who usually strongly oppose socialists believe that socialism is inevitable in Spain. The country must have a progressive class to lead and rule. In Western European countries, the bourgeoisie assumed this task, benefiting themselves, the country, and even the masses to some extent. But Spain has never developed into a bourgeoisie. This may be the reason for her decline. Now it is too late to create a Spanish bourgeoisie; the working and peasant masses are rising to seize power, to extricate themselves from misery, and to make Spain a modern and prosperous country.</p>
<p>Among Spain's 23,000,000 residents, 80% live in rural areas. If you add the official class and the urban intellectual class, the remaining industrial bourgeoisie is very limited. There is hardly a middle class. Under the empire, the Church was merely a system to help win over the people in darkness and ignorance. The people do not truly believe in religion; they resent the Church because it is the de facto spokesperson for their oppressors. All of this is very similar to the situation in Russia before 1917, and the conditions are also compatible with the same future development.</p>
<p>Not many days ago, I ran to the village of Pueblo del Rio, only thirty minutes by electric train from Seville. I had not been there for less than two years. The farmers immediately recognized me. I ran to the thatched mud huts. It was raining, and puddles had formed on the ground. The people were all poor and tattered; they had always suffered a lot, and according to their reports, "good or bad, nothing has changed." They were all vehemently opposed to the Church, and none of their children had been baptized. "The Church is only for the superstitious and the imperialists," one person said.</p>
<p>These farmers have nothing of their own—except for a few broken chairs, a table not good for eating, and a few crude benches used as beds. They work as day laborers for the large landowners, with a minimum wage of five "Peseta" (Spanish currency). They only have an average of three months of work per year. "Recently, under the compulsion of the government, there is finally more work, but the landlords do not pay wages. They live in Seville and Madrid, but there is no money." These people are so threatened by life that they dare not curse the wealthy. I have seen the Bedouin in the East. (Arabs who live in the Sahara and live a very hard life. - Translator) The lives of these Spaniards are really no better than theirs. There are tens of thousands of people living like this in Spain, living in caves and eating grass roots and bark.</p>
<p>This is naturally the lowest and most inferior dregs of humanity. But the "Yunteros," who have a pair of mules but no land, even those with one or two hectares of land, do not live comfortably. I have talked to twenty of these people. They are all malnourished. Their thirty-five-year-old women look about fifty years old. I asked a mother with four children why she had so many children. She replied: "They came, I would rather have none." In Caceres, the largest province in Spain, 61.6% of the population is illiterate. Other provinces are its sharp enemies. All of this is a death sentence for the ruling class.</p>

<p>Raphael, a Major General of the U.S. Army Reserve, stated in a speech at Virginia University today that Japan, Germany, and Italy are actively expanding their armaments in preparation for becoming international bandits. All three countries are industrial nations that, due to economic pressure from other countries, are eager to find supplies of raw materials and markets for selling goods. Therefore, the tariff barriers and import quotas of most countries are forcing the three countries to fight. The United States is facing two crises: one is that some militaristic countries intend to seize U.S. territory by force, and the other is that the United States will not be able to avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war.

<p>(Paris) Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the "L'Œuvre" newspaper, recently commented on the compromise reached between Germany and Italy, stating that the two countries seem to have agreed on a plan, the main points of which are no more than two: 1. To demand the amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations and to delete the sanctions clauses. 2. Regarding the colonial demands, she said, "I have received news from Austrian officialdom that the country is currently in negotiations with Germany, hoping to establish an agreement in politics and economics. This is at the instigation of Italy. At the same time, Italy has also given assurances to Austria that Germany will definitely respect the Austrian status quo. The key to the mutual compromise between Germany and Italy lies in this. Then the 'Central European Group' advocated by the German Emperor Wilhelm II will probably be revived to a considerable extent." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Recently, there have been frequent negotiations between the German and Italian governments, and rumors of forming an alliance have been rampant.

The German government guarantees Austria's independence for the next three years. 3. The Italian government guarantees for the next three years that Austria will not restore the monarchy. 4. Germany and Austria will resolve and sign an agreement on the outstanding issues between the two countries before September 15, but by this time the Austrian cabinet must be reorganized to make the nationalistic color stronger.

<p>Strengthening Air Force Strength in Egypt, Protecting the Suez Canal Area</p>
<p>(London) Recent international events have had a considerable impact on military strategy. Therefore, air traffic from Britain through the Persian Gulf to India is becoming increasingly important. In view of this, the British government is working hard to improve aviation affairs between Britain and India. According to powerful sources, if Italy were to open an airline to connect its North African Libyan territory with Abyssinia, its impact would be enough to endanger Egypt. If that were the case, Britain would do everything possible to obstruct it. In addition, the Air Force is the most effective means of defending the Suez Canal area. Therefore, the 300 British aircraft currently stationed in Egypt and Sudan will not only not be withdrawn in the future, but will also be concentrated near the canal after an agreement is established between Britain and Egypt, in order to protect it.

Minister of the Army Terauchi, in view of the implementation of this plan, considered the reform of the financial tax system and administrative institutions to be an absolute necessity. Therefore, at the cabinet meeting on the 10th, he took the lead in making important speeches, namely: 1. The urgency of implementing the military preparation replenishment plan. 2.

As a result, the public bond market has also improved. For example, the term interest rate, which was as high as 7% on June 15, has now been reduced to 4.5%, and the market price of public bonds has risen from 65.35 francs to 69.90 francs (market price on July 8). The example is also that we should rationalize the credit system, protect the savings industry, and reduce taxes, so that the national credit will be fully restored. However, this matter is of great importance, and many technical talents are now dedicated to research. The Minister of Finance then described the short-term treasury bills that the government plans to issue (a total of 100 billion francs), saying that the face value of these treasury bills varies, some are 100,000 francs, some are 10,000 francs, some are 500 francs, and some are 250 francs. The intention is to enable people across the country, regardless of their wealth, to purchase them. The benefits enjoyed by those who purchase treasury bills are also different. The term is extremely short, and the principal can be repaid after six months. It can be requested from the bank at any time for discounting. There are two types of interest rates, 3.5% for the six-month term and 4% for the one-year term, both of which are paid in advance by the government. These treasury bills are scheduled to be issued tomorrow. If the people of the country can actively purchase them, the prices of various public bonds will inevitably increase, the foreign exchange rate will inevitably improve, and the interest rates on deposits and loans will also be reduced. As a result, the costs of agriculture, industry, and commerce will inevitably decrease. In short, the government's responsibilities are extremely arduous, and it hopes that the people of the country will work together to assist it. It should be known that assisting France is assisting the cause of peace. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people of the country. If we can show our spiritual strength to the world, we can ask all countries to work together to clear up the economic chaos, the economic and financial wars, and the tariff wars, which are enough to destroy a country's foundation and cause conflicts between countries. It is necessary to stop them as soon as possible." (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Current Situation in Abyssinia Under Italian Rule <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Indigenous Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Dividing the Entire Territory into Five Provinces</p>
<p>Creating a Force of Muslims to Resist the Abyssinian Race</p>
<p>Cairo A Reuters correspondent who recently arrived here from Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, with the Northern Italian Army, Mr. Holmes, claimed today that the interior of Abyssinia is full of bandits, and the lives of Europeans are quite dangerous. Many of them have lost everything they own. More than a dozen Germans who are doing business in Abyssinia are now planning to leave with their families. The Italian army is now suppressing the bandits, often killing many people and burning the huts where the natives live. However, the Italian authorities deeply believe that the most effective way to eliminate bandits is to recruit bandits into the army, reorganize them, give them generous salaries, and provide them with new rifles. This method is currently being carried out in and around the capital of Abyssinia. In the near future, it seems that a cavalry of natives will be formed. The Italian authorities have divided Abyssinia into five major provinces, each with administrative organs. Italians in the capital of Abyssinia all call this a well-organized product of Mussolini's own brain, which will be used as a guide for the long-term plan based on the old Roman principle of division. Military construction in each province is different. The Illyria province is considered to be completely pacified and does not require many troops. It is said that only one division will be stationed. The Imperial Advisory Committee has now been established in the capital of Abyssinia, coexisting with the Administrative Council. The Administrative Council is an administrative body, while the Imperial Advisory Committee is used to recruit Abyssinian dignitaries and give them generous salaries. In addition to providing consultation, they cannot speak on political affairs. The same system is used in the provincial governments, so that those who used to be generals and presidents who obey the new government are rewarded. The boundaries of each province are based on race and culture, so as to avoid conflicts with each other. Special attention will be paid to the areas where Somalis and Harar Muslims live. The purpose is to create a Muslim force to resist the great plan of Arabia. Therefore, they are trying their best to please the Muslims. In the capital of Abyssinia and other places, construction is underway to build mosques. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Washington) U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Murphy resigned today to participate in the Democratic Party's gubernatorial race in Michigan. President Roosevelt has approved Murphy's two-month leave of absence without pay so that he can return to his original position if he fails in the race. This action by the Democratic Party seems likely to arouse the anger of the Republican Party, because it is improper for high-ranking officials to participate in partisan elections.

<h3 id="e56">Bulgarian Cabinet Reshuffle Inevitable <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Political Parties Request Restoration of Parliamentary System</p>
<p>Sofia – Rumors have repeatedly circulated here that a cabinet reshuffle to restore a parliamentary system of government is imminent. However, current conditions suggest it will be delayed somewhat. Following a petition to the King signed by sixty leaders of various political parties, requesting the restoration of the past liberal constitution, the military authorities, who are the real rulers of the country, were greatly alarmed to see these individuals forming a common front. They immediately exerted pressure on the government, resulting in a decision by the High Military Council earlier this month to prohibit party members, especially party leaders, from joining the cabinet. The parliamentary system of government was interrupted two years ago after the failed violent coup d'état by Colonel Velchev and his associates. Now, the entire nation believes that even if the government opposes its restoration, it can only delay it temporarily. An unprecedented unity of opinion among Bulgarian political parties regarding domestic policy is historically rare. As for foreign policy, they are divided into the "National Unity Front" and the "Democratic Strength Foundation" factions. The government has tried its best to persuade some party leaders to support its "new measures," but failed. The political parties are now demanding a swift cabinet reshuffle, with the inclusion of moderate elements to guarantee free elections. There are only two paths now: one is to form a government that enjoys public trust, and the other is to continue the "non-partisan" and "national unity cabinet" system. This system was established in May 1934 by Colonel Velchev, the "hidden hand of Bulgarian politics," but he was sentenced to life imprisonment for plotting sedition. The current cabinet, led by Prime Minister Kiosseivanov, maintains its so-called "new measures" and has done nothing to restore the much-needed national prosperity. According to its political opponents, the cabinet's only achievement has been to bring Velchev and his associates to justice. Therefore, apart from the army, it has few supporters. Although the cabinet reshuffle has been temporarily thwarted, it will eventually be realized sooner or later, thereby restoring the parliamentary system of government. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Intention to Consolidate Control of Soviet East</p>
<p>Puppet Headquarters Now Located in Mudanjiang – Harbin Correspondence: To facilitate attacks on anti-Japanese forces, defend against Russia, and control puppet troops, the Japanese Kwantung Army, since July 1st of the year before last, ordered the reorganization of the Northeast Provinces Garrison Headquarters into five major military districts (excluding the puppet Hinggan Province). Over the years, the Japanese side has considered these organizations to have become increasingly substantial and consolidated. Now, in order to strengthen eastern Manchuria, cope with the Soviet border area, and facilitate control, it has been decided to expand the original Suining District Headquarters, which belongs to the Fourth Puppet Military District, to a higher level, relocate it to Mudanjiang, and designate it as the Sixth Puppet Military District Headquarters. It will control military affairs such as border defense and security against Russia in Dongning, Muling, Ning'an, Mishan, Hulin, and other places in the east. This matter has been actively prepared by the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Puppet Military Affairs Department, and various responsible parties below the Fourth Puppet Military District, and everything is ready. It will be officially established in Mudanjiang on July 1st of this year. The position of commander of the Sixth Puppet Military District Headquarters will be assumed by Han Hao Wang Dianzhong, the former commander of the Andong District Headquarters, who has already taken office in Mudanjiang. Many Japanese and puppet military officials attended the inauguration ceremony.</p>

<p>He Advocates Peace Regarding the Current Situation</p>
<p>Consolidate the Central Government and Complete National Policies</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Director-General of the Pacification Headquarters, arrived in Wuhan from Hunan this morning, as the Second Plenary Session is being held today (the 10th). He then boarded a plane to Nanjing, arriving at 1:30 PM this afternoon. Accompanying him were He Chengjun, Hu Zongnan, and others. When He and his party landed at the airport, over two hundred people, including Cheng Qian, Gu Zhutong, Zhang Fang, and representatives from various military and political institutions, were present to welcome them, creating a very warm atmosphere. Reporters noted that Hunan Province's position is of great importance given the recent military actions in Guangdong and Guangxi. When He Jian was previously urged by the Guangdong and Guangxi factions to take the lead in resisting Japan, he expressed the need to resist aggression under the overall national policy and telegraphed all parties advocating peace. Therefore, the situation has been eased. It can be seen that He plays a crucial role in the overall situation. Therefore, reporters visited He's residence in Shuizuogang. As He was busy with official matters, he sent Liu Huarui, a consultant to the Hunan Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters, to meet with them. The conversation was as follows: "Mr. He Yunqiao was very busy with government affairs in Hunan, so he flew here this morning to attend the Second Plenary Session and must return to Changsha soon. Last month, the Southwest factions urged Mr. He to lead the resistance against Japan, but he replied by telegram, explaining the necessity of peace and unity, advising against hasty actions, and simultaneously advocating this view to all parties. Therefore, although the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi have entered Hunan and troops are stationed in Hengyang, both sides are very calm. This is the earliest result of Mr. He's advocacy of peace and provides great help to the future of the country. When the Southwest factions launched military action, the troops in Hunan had shared weal and woe with Mr. He for many years. Moreover, Mr. He is kind and benevolent, so there is unity and harmony from top to bottom, which outsiders cannot fathom. Mr. He is a leader uniformly believed in and supported by the military and civilians in Hunan. He advocates consolidating the central government and completing the overall national policy. He is selfless and comes to Nanjing this time to fulfill his consistent advocacy of peace. When Mr. He is in Hunan, no matter how busy he is with government affairs, his daily life is regular, frugal, and simple, enjoying the same pleasures as the people, and he has no bad habits. He likes to read famous works from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and especially likes to study the progress of international military, political, and cultural affairs for reference. His martial arts skills are excellent, and his spirit and physique are both sufficient. Recently, he designated Hengshan County as an experimental county, so that scholars can have the opportunity to develop their talents. He treats scholars with respect and approaches people with sincerity. Fortunately, all parties value Mr. He's personality and advocacy, so the situation has not deteriorated. Mr. He's duty is to protect the territory and secure the people, and he also advocates universal love, harmony, and peace internationally. Except when resistance against aggression is unavoidable, he does not want to easily start wars between nations. He believes that the cultures and knowledge of the world's nations are all mutually disseminated and have mutual influence and benefit, and the races are distinguished only because of differences in climate and environment, but in fact, the world is one family."

<h3 id="e64">Yellow River in Shandong Province Continues to Rise <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Dangerous Work Occurs at Liuyuan</p>
<p>River Affairs Bureau Preparing for Major Floods</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water level of the Yellow River in Gansu Province suddenly rose by more than two meters several days ago, and its momentum was fierce and flowing straight downstream. It has now flowed to the lower reaches, so the river level in Shandong Province has risen. On the 8th, the water level at Luokou was 29.36 meters, up 2.5 decimeters from the 7th, and about two meters below the highest recorded level. However, the water level at Lishengtun, upstream in Shandong Province, was 57.27 meters on the 8th, about one meter and two decimeters below the highest recorded level, and slightly lower than on the 7th. It is thought that the rising water from Gansu has already passed, and the water level at Luokou may not increase any further. According to the River Affairs Bureau, dangerous work occurred on the 7th at the Liuyuan embankment (opposite the Kangtun dangerous work) in the Puyang County section of the northern bank upstream in the province. Due to the fierce scouring of the river water, two sections of the embankment collapsed into the water. Fortunately, the soldiers and laborers in charge fought hard to protect it, and it was quickly stabilized. The River Affairs Bureau has reported the situation to the Provincial Government. The River Affairs Bureau is now preparing for the flood season, which begins on the 17th of this month. Based on past precedents, flood prevention committee members should be sent to various sections to assist in defense. It is also heard that Han Fuju, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, is actively reorganizing the river works. However, he believes that there is no need for too many flood prevention committee members this time and has designated 24 people (compared to over 50 in previous years), changing their title to flood prevention officers. They will be summoned for instructions in the next few days and then assigned to various sections to serve. In addition, for the convenience of conscripting laborers and supervising work, Han plans to issue an order, based on past cases, to the magistrates of the 22 counties along the river, requiring them to move to the embankment to take charge.

<h3 id="e65">Qingdao: Lawsuit After Minghua Bank Collapse <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Gangbo Sentenced to Four Years in Prison</p>
<p>And Deprived of Civil Rights for Five Years</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao Minghua Bank collapsed last May. Most depositors believed that Zhang Gangbo, the bank manager, induced depositors with high interest rates, resulting in savings reaching a huge amount of more than one million yuan, and used the stored money for personal squandering, which was a deliberate fraud. If he is not severely punished, how can we warn the cunning and maintain the rights of creditors? Recently, depositors such as Ding Bingnan specially filed a lawsuit with the Qingdao District Court against Zhang Gangbo for fraud. The court has conducted several interrogations and sentenced Zhang Gangbo to four years in prison and deprived him of civil rights for five years. The judgment was delivered yesterday, and the original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Judgment</p>
<p>Plaintiff Ding Bingnan, Plaintiff Liu Xunmin, Attorney Zhou Feng, Defendant Zhang Gangbo, 51 years old, residing at Minghua Bank, Zhongshan Road, Manager, Defendant Xiao Wentian, 59 years old, residing at Continental Bank, Zhongshan Road, Manager, Appointed Defense Attorney Zhang Zonggeng, Right Defendants, case numbers 735 and 913, 24th, due to a fraud case, the plaintiffs filed lawsuits one after another, and this court combined the judgments as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Zhang Gangbo continuously intended to illegally possess property for himself and induced others to hand over their belongings through fraud, and is sentenced to four years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years. Zhang Gangbo is not guilty of other charges. Xiao Wentian is not guilty.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Zhang Gangbo has been operating Minghua Bank for many years and has established head offices in Shanghai and branches in Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic recession, knowing that it was difficult to continue operating, he induced depositors with high interest rates in order to achieve his purpose of fraud. Many citizens of this city were deceived, resulting in savings reaching a huge amount of more than one million yuan. Minghua Bank went bankrupt on May 23rd of last year. After more than half a year, there was still no way to repay the depositors. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the court alleging that the defendants committed fraud.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The defendant Zhang Gangbo in this case has been operating Minghua Bank for many years. In recent years, knowing that the business was declining and could not continue to operate, he still induced depositors with high interest rates and absorbed as much savings as possible. On May 23rd of last year, he declared bankruptcy. Until this year, he has been unable to repay the depositors. The plaintiff Ding Bingnan is also a depositor who deposited 500 yuan in fixed deposits and 100 yuan in current deposits in Minghua Bank and was deceived by the defendant Zhang Gangbo. It was found that most of the citizens of this city who deposited money in Minghua Bank were vendors and laborers who used their hard-earned money to deposit in Minghua Bank for interest to prepare for emergencies. However, things did not go as they wished and were defrauded by the defendant Zhang Gangbo, causing many people's lives to be unsustainable. Therefore, the defendant's criminal circumstances are extremely serious and should be severely punished. As for the defendant Xiao Wentian, on May 22nd of last year, he lent 20,000 yuan to Minghua Bank in the name of Continental Bank, and Minghua Bank transferred the mortgage right of Liu Xunmin's real estate to Continental Bank. This situation was not only unanimously confessed by the defendants but was also confirmed by this court's verification of the account books submitted by the defendants, so the defendants Xiao Wentian's crime and the defendant Zhang Gangbo's part of the crime cannot be proven and should be declared innocent. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 291, Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 339, Paragraph 1, Article 56, and Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Bandits Very Active in Southern Fujian and Southwestern Guangdong <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>But Most Large Bands Have Been Incorporated</p>
<p>Small Bands Should Be Easily Suppressed</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The border area between Fujian and Guangdong has been relatively quiet in the past week. Except for a unit of the Guangdong Army at Sancengling on the border of Dabu advancing 15 li into the Xiayang Township in the Fifth District of Yongding, there have been no new movements. However, the remnants of the communists in western Fujian and the local bandits in southern Fujian are extremely active. According to the latest report, Zhang Changshui's force of more than 200 communists in Heping, Puyang, and Jingyi attacked and plundered Guande Town in the Fourth District of Zhangpu at around 9:00 PM one night. The town suffered losses of nearly 100,000 yuan, and five district officials and strong men, and nine male and female citizens were killed. Twenty firearms were seized. In the morning of the second day, the bandits kidnapped Chen Wenpin, the chief of the Fourth District, who was also killed shortly after. Qujiang Town in Nan'an County, Quanzhou Prefecture, was captured by more than 200 communists led by Zhang Dingsheng on the second day. A drill instructor surnamed Xu and three members of the Zhang family, father and sons, were killed. A female teacher at the Taxia Elementary School was kidnapped. One bandit was killed and seven were injured. In Houkengpu Town in Nan'an County, Quanzhou Prefecture, more than 30 bandits posing as incorporated militiamen entered the town and plundered on the third day. The town suffered losses of more than 20,000 yuan, and the owners of nine major stores, including Zhenyu Dried Fruit Store, were kidnapped. Chen Meixiong, a bandit leader in Cixiao Township, Xianyou, raised the banner of the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army" and captured Ancuohoufeng and other villages in the Second District on the seventh day, looting and killing two chiefs and one strong man. On the eighth day, local communists ambushed a bus on the Zhanglong Road between Shizhong and Hutou, causing the bus company to lose thousands of yuan. Countless other small bands are looting everywhere. The recent activity of communist bandits in western Fujian and local bandits in southern Fujian definitely has a background. Moreover, Zhang Kewu, who previously attacked Datian, has now been incorporated, with more than 800 people gathered awaiting inspection. They will be organized into a security regiment, with Zhang Kewu serving as the commander. Zhang Chengfu, Zhang Yifeng, and Tu Feifeng will serve as battalion commanders. Currently, there are still small bands of scattered bandits everywhere in various townships in Dehua and Yongchun, extorting money. However, since Zhang Kewu has been pacified, the center of the bandit situation has been lost. The bandit disasters in Yongchun, Dehua, Datian, Putian, Xianyou, and Taiyun should be easy to quell. Next is Anxi, where the bandit situation is very complicated. Lu Zhenshan has gathered various bands totaling 800 people, occupying the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts of Anxi. On the sixth day, Cheng Zaoling, the magistrate of Anxi County, personally went to Changkeng and arranged to meet with Lu in Taozhou, intending to recruit Lu's troops and organize them into the Anxi Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps, limited to 500 men. If this becomes a reality, Anxi can also be somewhat stabilized. In addition, there are Guo Zongzhan, Xing Hai, and others with over a hundred people each, but they will be easily subdued.</p>

It is learned that after receiving the order, Fan is actively preparing everything for surveying the actual conditions of both banks of the river. According to Fan, the Provincial Government has made the greatest determination to promote the realization of the afforestation project along the Yellow River in Gansu Province. Currently, due to economic difficulties, the scope of afforestation is limited to the main stream of the Yellow River, and other tributaries are temporarily difficult to implement. Therefore, the scope of my survey is also limited to both banks of the main stream. The survey route this time is approximately 900 li long, and the round trip is 2,000 li. If the departure date cannot be realized by the end of this month, it will definitely depart from Lanzhou at the beginning of next month, so as to complete the survey as soon as possible. Regarding the route to be taken during the survey, it is planned to start from Lan County, proceed westward along the south bank of the Yellow River, passing through Xincheng, Yongjing, and Linxia, to Jishiguan. This is the starting point of afforestation along the Yellow River in Gansu Province (the border between Gansu and Qinghai). Then, cross the river from there to the north bank, and then survey eastward along the north bank, passing through Hekou and other places to Jincheng Pass, cross the Yellow River Iron Bridge and return to Lanzhou. Report the survey details after passing, and then depart from Lanzhou again, still proceeding eastward along the south bank of the Yellow River, passing through Fangjiaquan, Jianluogou, Dashengou, Jingyuan, Dabao Village, to the Gansu-Ningxia border at Wofosi. This is the end point of afforestation along the Yellow River in Gansu Province. After crossing the river from there, proceed along the north bank of the Yellow River towards Lanzhou, passing through Wofosi, Lutang, Beigang, Honggou River, Jinkou, Shuifutang River, and other places, to Jincheng Pass, cross the bridge and return to Lanzhou. After arriving in Lanzhou, prepare a report on the survey results and submit it for approval as preparation for the implementation of afforestation. The survey period is scheduled for three months. During this period, the survey may be completed.</p>

<p>Rare in the World</p>
<p>Worth Four Thousand Yuan Per Ton</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Yongjia and Qingtian Counties in southern Zhejiang Province are famous for producing molybdenum ore, which is the most valuable and rare mineral in the world and is used to refine steel. It is coveted by foreigners. In the past, unscrupulous merchants have repeatedly used it to apply to the Provincial Government for trial mining. However, the competent department of the Construction Department believed that the mineral is a rare product in the world, worth 4,000 yuan per ton, and is deeply related to military affairs and national defense. Therefore, the matter was carefully considered and not approved. It is learned that the Provincial Government has decided to mine the mineral and has been approved by the Ministry of Industry to issue a license for the province to raise funds for development itself, so as to avoid it being acquired by others in the future. It is estimated that the project will be planned and started in the shortest possible time. (July 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Songjiang County Magistrate Seizes Bandit Weapons <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The training of the local leaders in this county began uniformly throughout the county on the 4th. In addition to assigning personnel to reside in each district for supervision, the County Magistrate Li has been inspecting each training ground district by district since the 8th, riding the Yun Jian steamer, accompanied by the Captain of the Water Patrol Team, Fei Gongxia. The local leaders were all conscientious, which was very satisfying. Yesterday, in Shanyang, it was reported that Xu Ayun, the remnant of the bandit leader Li Jinxiang who had been executed, was hiding in Shuike. County Magistrate Li and Captain Fei personally went to the address to search. However, the bandit Xu Ayun had already fled elsewhere. After interrogating his mother, she was ordered to hand over two bandit weapons, one being a six-inch Browning pistol, serial number 35356, and the other being a lotus pistol used by Li Jinxiang when he first became a bandit. The gun has been induced and still has a bullet inside. There was nothing else. They were immediately taken away. It is said that County Magistrate Li had received the report about these bandit weapons in advance, so he forced the bandit's mother to hand them over.</p>

<p>Outside Qimen, near the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway bridge, at 7:00 PM on the 9th, a middle-aged man wearing a gray silk long gown lingered. As the Shanghai-Changzhou train passed by, the man lay down on the tracks and committed suicide. He was crushed to death on the spot, his body and head separated, a tragic sight. The local bailiff found a suicide note beside his body and immediately reported it to the local prosecutor's office for verification. On the morning of the 10th, the office sent Prosecutor Lü and a forensic officer to verify. After confirming that he had been crushed to death, they instructed the local bailiff to prepare a coffin and collect the body, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Candle Industry Labor Dispute <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Because of the decline in business this spring, the candle industry in the Suzhou area has collectively reduced its scope of operations. After the Dragon Boat Festival, each store laid off as many as 52 workers, causing a sudden increase in unemployment and widespread panic. The labor union immediately requested relief from the Party and government authorities, demanding reinstatement to maintain livelihoods. However, the employers' trade association stated that the issue of reinstatement was out of the question and presented four rational points, requesting that the Party and government authorities convene a meeting to revise the labor-management agreement. The County Party Headquarters has ordered the trade association to quickly explain the reasons for the layoffs and will convene a meeting of representatives from both labor and management and the General Labor Union and Chamber of Commerce within days to mediate and achieve the goal of labor-management cooperation.</p>

<p>Zhang Lu, a widow from Fusang, Shazhou, had an affair with Wang Maoquan, a farmer from the same village. This led to her eighteen-year-old biological son, Zhang Yuqing, being brutally murdered by her lover. Afterward, she not only failed to investigate but also helped bury the body to cover up the crime. Subsequently, the deceased's aunt discovered and reported the crime, leading to the arrest of the adulterous couple and their accomplices. Wang Maoquan confessed to beating Zhang Yuqing to death. The case was adjudicated yesterday at 11 a.m. Wang Maoquan was sentenced to death for murder. Zhang Lu was sentenced to two years and ten months in prison for jointly concealing evidence in a criminal case against another person (twice). Ji Kouhou was sentenced to one year for jointly burying the body. Pan Chuhou, also involved in burying the body, was given a reduced sentence of six months due to being a minor. Wang Maoquan, dissatisfied with the county court's verdict, immediately declared his intention to appeal in court.</p>

<p>It has been extremely hot and humid here recently. On the 9th of this month, the maximum temperature reached 92.1 degrees, which is more than six degrees higher than on the same day last year. People are sweating profusely and complaining about the heat. All government agencies below the government level have stopped working in the afternoon. However, there have been reports of cholera. A soldier named Yang from the security brigade felt unwell at 10 a.m. on the 9th, experiencing dizziness. In less than three hours, he suddenly fainted and his limbs turned cold. After being sent to the county hospital, he was diagnosed with true cholera and soon died. At the same time, cases have also been reported in the Xiaodongmen area. The authorities are currently taking preventive measures.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Rice Prices Suddenly Soar <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Over the past week, rice prices here have suddenly soared, reaching ten yuan and fifty or sixty cents per stone, an increase of about one yuan and fifty cents. The prices of other grains, such as wheat, have also generally increased, causing panic among the lower classes. According to people in the rice industry, it is normal for rice prices to rise during this lean season, but such a sudden increase is unusual. There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain, the farming season has arrived, and the supply of rice is scarce.</p>
<p>After speculators were unable to manipulate Shanghai's gold standard public bonds, they shifted their attention to rice and grain, deliberately disrupting the market and causing instability. This county has been affected by this situation.</p>

<p>Following the smuggling case at the local railway station, the County Chamber of Commerce sent an official letter to Huang Boqiao, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, requesting that he announce the details of the smuggling case to clarify the facts and protect the reputation of local businesses, as there were rumors circulating that were damaging to their reputation. After receiving the letter, Huang sent a telegram to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the case of railway station staff in Wuxi protecting smugglers occurred before March of this year. Upon receiving a confidential report, the bureau immediately sent loyal and capable personnel and entrusted the special-grade Party headquarters of the two railway lines to handle the matter. Special agents conducted a thorough investigation for several months and confirmed that the information was accurate. The relevant personnel have been punished and the matter has been reported to the Ministry of Railways for review. Until a response is received, it is not appropriate to make any announcements. The investigation into who was colluding with the smugglers does not fall under the bureau's discipline management, so no investigation will be conducted. The bureau has no knowledge of the points mentioned in the local newspapers and cannot respond.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Summer Suspension of Initiation into Abstinence <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The County Anti-Smoking Committee held its sixth meeting yesterday, chaired by Li Tiping. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>The addition of 7,770 yuan to the county's 25th-year land tax revenue as funding for the anti-smoking center seems inconsistent with the original principle of using anti-smoking revenue for anti-smoking purposes. A request will be submitted to the provincial capital to ask the provincial government to allocate the funds from the anti-smoking revenue as originally planned and to publicize the anti-smoking revenue to the people of Suzhou to demonstrate credibility and emphasize anti-smoking policies.</p>
<p>The committee will work with the correctional institution to assist the government in improving sanitation in the correctional facilities for smoking offenders. Committee member Li will negotiate with the county government and the local court prosecutor's office to handle the matter.</p>
<p>The county government will be requested to investigate and, following past practice, suspend initiation into abstinence during the summer to avoid overcrowding and the spread of disease in the anti-smoking center.</p>
<p>The revenue and expenditure of the committee since its establishment will be audited by committee members Cheng Jingtang and Xu Chizi before being submitted to the province for reporting.</p>

On the 7th, Li traveled to Shanghai for business, carrying 1,800 yuan in cash and 17,000 yuan in bank checks. While the train was passing through the Xinlonghua station, a fashionable young man sitting next to Li, taking advantage of Li's drowsiness, forcibly robbed him. As passengers were getting off the train, the young man fled. Military police on the train were informed and got off to pursue him. The incident has spread far and wide, causing widespread astonishment.</p>

<p>In Yuchi, a village near Jinshan in the northern part of this county, lived two brothers surnamed Pan. The younger brother, named Axiao, was naturally weak. He married a woman surnamed Yang. Yang had an affair with her husband's cousin, A'gen. The night before last, at the second watch (around 10 p.m.), Yang secretly arranged for A'gen to come to her house. While her husband was asleep, the two of them attacked him with knives, inflicting a total of eight wounds to his head, arms, chest, and abdomen. Axiao, covered in blood, fled to his brother's house and told him what had happened. Soon after, his intestines spilled out and he collapsed and died. After daybreak, his brother reported the crime to the authorities. Yang and the father of the murderer have been arrested. However, the murderer, A'gen, is still at large.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the Ling Bridge in this port, discussions on rebuilding the Xinjiang Bridge have been actively underway. It is reported that the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association held a meeting the other day and decided to reorganize the Shanghai and Ningbo preparatory offices. The Shanghai committee nominated 39 members, including Du Yuesheng and Yu Zuoting. The Ningbo committee nominated 11 members, including Wang Wenhan, Yu Zuochen, Chen Ruxin, Zhou Dalie, Jin Zhenxiang, Yu Runquan, Mao Jiasheng, Zhu Xuchang, Zhuo Baoting, Chen Baolin, and Yu Jimin. It is planned to raise 700,000 yuan for construction, initially by soliciting 350 founders, each contributing 2,000 yuan. The materials will be sourced domestically as a principle. Zhang Jiguang, Yu Zuoting, and Wang Gaosun are responsible for the design. It is said that after the Xinjiang Bridge is rebuilt, it will be renamed Zhongzheng Bridge. The Xiangxi Highway was flooded by torrential rains on the 6th, causing the road surface to become like a river, making it difficult for cars to travel and disrupting traffic. Although the weather cleared on the 8th, the water had not completely receded, making it difficult to restore the road to its original condition. It is expected that traffic will resume in a day or two. In addition, over 7,000 dried fish stacked by the Yushang Fish Market near the Wuliao Bridge were washed away by flash floods after the heavy rain, resulting in significant losses. Countless houses collapsed and people were injured, making it a truly devastating calamity.</p>

The other accomplices, Weng Ahe and four others, were each sentenced to 15 years in prison and sent to jail.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Xiaoshan: Reasons for the Soaring Price of Grain <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The grain produced in Xiaoshan County is only sufficient to supply the county for half a year. The rest must be imported from neighboring counties such as Zhuji and Shengxian. Therefore, every year during the summer lean season, the price of rice increases significantly. This year, the new grain from Zhuji has not yet been harvested, and the hoarders are unwilling to sell at a fair price. In addition, surplus grain from other counties is being transported to Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places to be sold at high prices. Therefore, the price of rice purchased by Xiaoshan from Hangzhou and the Huzhou region has increased significantly. As a result, the price of rice sold in stores has risen sharply since July 5th, with the price of ordinary rice also exceeding one yuan per dou. The poor are complaining, and life is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the hot weather, a type of cotton pest has been discovered in the sandy cotton fields of the Kanshan area in Dongxiang. These pests specifically eat cotton buds and young leaves, spreading over thousands of acres.

The County Pest Control Committee has received reports and has sent personnel to the countryside to find ways to prevent and control the pests. It is also reported that similar cotton pests have been discovered in the Xinlinzhou area, and the Township Farmers' Association has taken measures to catch them in order to eliminate the damage they cause.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YMCA is hosting an exhibition of air defense, anti-poisoning, and first aid knowledge. The collection of items for the exhibition has been difficult. Although the YMCA has been preparing for a long time and has achieved some scale, it is still not perfect. However, it is still a great accomplishment. All the details have been reported in various newspapers. The exhibition is now ready and will open to the public starting today. In addition to air defense, anti-poisoning, first aid, military equipment, and various charts hanging on the walls, there are also models of air raid shelters, bomb shells, first aid equipment and medicines, various gas masks, and various books on air defense and anti-poisoning, all displayed on the second floor of the YMCA for public viewing. The YMCA has also collected various materials on air defense, anti-poisoning, and first aid and has compiled three pamphlets for widespread dissemination. Originally, it was intended to give them away for free, but due to funding constraints, there is a charge of four cents per set for printing costs. For mail orders from other cities, the charge is six and a half cents, including postage. The exhibition is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. During these extraordinary times, this kind of knowledge is essential for us. The YMCA's efforts to hold this exhibition are truly beneficial to the public. We hope that people from all walks of life will visit the exhibition and not take it lightly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union sent a telegram congratulating the Second Plenary Session, addressed to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, for forwarding to all members of the Second Plenary Session. "The national crisis is severe. Survival is impossible without resisting the invaders. We hope that the central authorities will weigh the urgency of the situation and gradually improve the national situation and lay the foundation for our country. Unexpectedly, a few comrades in the Southwest have caused problems, leaving the people of the country at a loss. We are delighted to hear that you have come to the capital during the hot summer to jointly decide on national policies. We hope that you will uphold justice and plan with vigor. The rise and fall of the nation depends on it. We send this telegram to express our congratulations. Please consider it. Zhou Xuexiang, acting chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, and standing committee members Ye Xianggao, Zhang Kechang, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, and Li Mengnan, respectfully salute."</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' General Union sent a telegram to congratulate the Second Plenary Session on its opening, bringing together the strength of the masses to discuss national affairs. It also made a request regarding the lack of provisions for representatives from the postal workers' union in the National Assembly representative election law. Here is an excerpt from the original telegram: "Nanjing Central Executive Committee, Fifth Session, Second Plenary Meeting, the national crisis is urgent. The central government is expected to reverse the calamity with a spirit of hard work and self-reliance. The external threat of aggression has not been resolved, yet the danger of internal strife is still present. Regardless of whether the comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi can awaken, the central government, at this juncture of survival, must quickly decide on domestic and foreign policies to quell the chaos and resist aggression. This conference has a great mission. We hope that you will embrace the most sacrificial enthusiasm and make the most feasible decisions. As long as it is beneficial to the country, any sacrifice is acceptable to the people. Furthermore, the National Assembly representative election law and its implementing regulations still do not provide for representation for the postal workers' union, which has a long history and outstanding service. This is unfair, both legally and emotionally. We implore the attendees to uphold the principle of fair legislation and quickly decide to supplement the regulations to promote constitutional governance and satisfy the people's expectations. We are eagerly awaiting your decision. The National Postal Workers' General Union salutes. Furthermore, it is reported that the union has submitted separate petitions to the Central Party Headquarters Executive Committee, the National Government Military Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters, requesting a revision to the number of representatives for the postal workers' union."</p>

<p>Xiang Kangyuan Summoned to Beijing for Detailed Inquiries</p>
<p>Xiang Kangyuan, General Manager of the Shanghai Kang Yuan Food Factory, was recently summoned to Beijing by President Chiang to inquire about the situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xiang yesterday to inquire about the details of the meeting. Mr. Xiang said that after receiving the summons, he made a special trip to Beijing to meet President Chiang at the Mausoleum Village. They had two meetings. The first meeting was about the general situation of domestic industry and commerce, factory management, the establishment of heavy industry, the improvement of trade associations, and the control of industry and commerce. The discussions were exploratory and did not lead to any specific decisions. Chiang showed great concern for various industries in China, especially emerging industries. He had a passion for encouraging and rescuing both heavy and small industries. He said that unless Chinese industry and commerce revives, political and economic problems cannot be effectively addressed. He also gave detailed instructions on the direction of national economic construction. His loyalty and sincerity were inspiring. The second meeting focused on Kang Yuan Food Factory's past and present situation. Chiang and his wife watched a film about the factory's operations and praised the factory's efforts to promote the activities of children. Before leaving, Chiang said that he would continue to meet with representatives from the industrial sector and would be receptive to any suggestions for rescuing or improving industry and commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Zhejiang Public Association Appeals for Gradual Collection of Overdue Taxes <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a touching plea was submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Public Association in this port submitted a document to Huang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Cheng, Director of the Finance Department: "The people owe old taxes because of years of famine and excessive surcharges, making it impossible to pay on time. This is not intentional tax evasion. During the first phase of tax collection, tax collectors and officials abused their authority and used coercion, causing further disturbances. For minor overdue amounts, people were summoned and detained. Those who complied with the summons and paid were still suddenly arrested. Ancestral temples and public property were ordered to be liquidated to cover the taxes of one person. People with similar surnames were mistakenly detained. Relatives and even cohabitants were implicated and arrested. Detentions even extended to women and children, filling the prisons. All of this is factual. Fellow villagers from various places have repeatedly come to the association to complain and request a petition.</p>
<p>Hoping for Leniency</p>
<p>We have repeatedly declined, not daring to submit the petition, because tax revenue is the province's legitimate income and paying taxes is the people's duty. Although the collection procedures may have been too strict, the years of arrears are ultimately the people's own fault. Now that the first phase has ended, we hear that the amount collected is not too small. At a time when the people's resources are scarce, taking flesh to heal wounds causes deep pain. We dare not use the analogy of Mount Tai, a fierce tiger, or Liu Zongyuan's snake catcher to compare ourselves, but the people are exhausted and deserve a short respite. If a little more time is granted, it would be a great favor from a benevolent person. Furthermore, taxes have been in arrears for as long as nine years, and it is impossible to recover them all in one year. The people's resources are limited and blood will eventually run dry. Our association humbly</p>
<p>Submits a Plea on Behalf of the People</p>
<p>We propose that the continued collection of old taxes, scheduled for September of this year, be postponed until April or May of next year so that indebted households can prepare in advance and avoid a last-minute scramble. This would also prevent the new taxes from being affected. We also request that the deadline for settlement be extended and that a system of phased repayment be implemented, allowing households with larger arrears to pay in installments. This would alleviate the people's suffering and facilitate financial planning, benefiting both sides. We urgently submit this petition, hoping that your government will investigate, approve, and implement it. We would be deeply grateful. The Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association respectfully salutes."</p>

<p>Staff Members Bravely Conduct Inventory Under the Scorching Heat</p>
<p>The ancient artifacts from the Peiping Palace Museum that were moved to Shanghai for safekeeping have been undergoing inventory and inspection since Shu Chushi was appointed by the Ministry of Education to supervise the process two years ago. Due to the heavy workload, progress has been slow, and the entire process is still not complete after nearly two years. Currently, all types of utensils, bronzes, and paintings and calligraphy from the previous dynasties and the Tang and Song dynasties have been unpacked and inspected. The Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasty artifacts are particularly numerous and of high quality, accounting for seventy to eighty percent of the collection and being in better condition than those preserved from previous dynasties. In this humid and hot season, the Shanghai office, following the instructions of Museum Director Ma Heng, has been working harder to complete the task as soon as possible. Therefore, Section Chief Ouyang Banghua, along with supervising committee member Shu Chushi, have been bravely continuing the inventory in the storage rooms on Tianzhu Church Street, working diligently under the scorching heat. In addition to the inventory work, it has been discovered that a large number of embroidery and paintings and calligraphy have mildew spots during this humid season. Section Chief Ouyang personally supervised the staff in opening the boxes and taking out the items one by one to expose them to the sun, in order to preserve them in good condition.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Resolution of the Yangtze River Piece Goods Merchant Guild's Strike <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Two Million Worth of Stockpiled Goods Have Begun Loading</p>
<p>Water Freight Modification is Under Discussion</p>
<p>On the first of this month, the six companies of the Yangtze River shipping lines announced the implementation of a measuring system for piece goods and Western cloth going upstream, and also an increase in water freight to 13.6 yuan per ton (40 chi). The piece goods merchant guild in Shanghai and various customs brokers along the Yangtze River repeatedly negotiated with the six companies, but failed to achieve the goal of reducing freight costs. Therefore, starting from July 1st, they implemented a final measure against the six shipping companies for all piece goods and Western cloth being shipped to the Yangtze River:</p>
<p>A Unified Strike</p>
<p>On one hand, the piece goods industry publicly elected Chen Panjun, a leader of the customs brokers' association, to negotiate with the six companies, aiming to achieve a more lenient allowance for measurements (according to the new regulations, each piece was only allowed 18 chi, a difference of 12 chi from the original box size) and to reduce freight costs. Because water freight charged according to the new regulations resulted in a difference of as much as 4.7 yuan per box of piece goods, negotiations lasting more than ten days had not yet yielded a definite solution, leading to a stockpile of four to five thousand pieces of Yangtze River piece goods in Shanghai, worth two million yuan. Finally, because both sides were resolute, which was not beneficial to either "commerce" or "shipping," Wu Delin, the deputy manager of the Sanbei Company, stepped in to</p>
<p>Reconcile with Merchants</p>
<p>Using peaceful methods for mediation, he also consulted with the authorities of various shipping companies such as Taikoo, Nissin, Ewo, and China Merchants, to provide piece goods merchants with a way out, to prevent the strike from lasting too long or expanding, and to avoid unnecessary sacrifices for both sides. At the same time, he requested Chen Panjun to contact the merchants and ensure that the strike was ended and loading resumed as soon as possible. It was decided that the increase in fees and the measuring system would be</p>
<p>Postponed for Half a Month</p>
<p>To be implemented on July 15th. At the same time, the six companies agreed to accommodate the opinions put forward by Chen Panjun and others, and to reduce the new water freight rates. However, the large quantities of piece goods already piled up in various warehouses had to be shipped first, and would still be given preferential treatment with the original water freight rates, with as many Chinese ships being used as possible. The commercial shipping to Hunan Province, which had been interrupted due to previous incidents, had now come to an end, and telegrams were being sent to Shanghai urging the shipment of goods. The piece goods merchants, following Wu's proposal, had accepted the mediation plan and called off the strike starting from the 9th, and since the beginning of this week, they had already</p>
<p>Started Reporting Shipments</p>
<p>Up to today, at least two to three thousand boxes of piece goods and Western cloth have been loaded, of which five-tenths are destined for Hunan Province, and the rest to Jiujiang and Hankou. Taikoo and Sanbei, among others, have therefore opened direct routes to Hunan to expedite the upstream transport of piece goods. The China Merchants Bureau has also decided to dispatch the Jiangjing ship to Changsha to transport these goods. As for the modification of the newly set water freight rates, the six companies will convene another meeting to decide on it, and then notify the merchants. It is expected that a decision can be reached around the 15th. A major strike by the Yangtze River piece goods merchants has come to an end.</p>

<p>The Euro-Asia Aviation Corporation leased a JU52 engine-powered giant aircraft from the German Lufthansa, and the company sent pilot Luther to fly it to China. They had received telegrams confirming the scheduled takeoff and that it had safely crossed the Arabian Sea eastward. According to Lufthansa, after the aircraft left Germany on the 4th, while flying over Greece, a mechanic suddenly collapsed in the plane due to a severe leg ailment. Pilot Luther, for the safety of the flight, immediately landed in Athens and sent the mechanic to the hospital for treatment. He also telegraphed Berlin to request a replacement mechanic.

<p>Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai Unveiled the Banner, Chen Jicheng Raised the Flag</p>
<p>The Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition held its opening ceremony at the Wujiaochang Times Middle School in Caojiadu yesterday at 2 PM. More than 200 people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Tong Xingbai, Yuan Ludeng, and Tan Baoshou. Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Hanqiang, Xu Xiaoquan, Yu Yuqing, Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Zhu Gengtao, and Cao Zhigong served as the presidium. Tong Xingbai unveiled the banner, and Chen Jicheng raised the flag. After the ceremony, Chairman Cao Zhigong gave a report, followed by speeches from Tong Xingbai, Chen Jicheng, and Yu Yuqing.</p>
<p>Unveiling the Banner and Raising the Flag: Followed by the band, the presidium accompanied Tong Xingbai, holding silver scissors, to cut the red and green ribbons at the gate and pull open the curtain. Then, Chen Jicheng raised the national flag high. The music sounded, and cheers erupted. The conference presented "Huafie Black and White Girl" cigarettes, "Wuzhou" Sha Medicine Water, "Liangdan," Chinese and Western folding fans, and "Zhongfa" Dan Sha Medicine Water fans.</p>
<p>Conference Declaration: The conference's meeting with the public coincides with a period of serious smuggling nationwide. Therefore, this national goods exhibition has deeper significance than in the past. (Omission)... Tax evasion and smuggling not only undermine our country's tariffs and foreign credit, but also seriously impact the precarious national industrial and commercial sectors. If we do not act quickly to remedy the situation, the national economy will collapse, and we will not be able to stand on our own, let alone resist foreign invasion. Recently, the government authorities have promulgated anti-smuggling regulations and are strictly investigating and prosecuting smuggling. The industrial, commercial, and civic groups have also become aware of the problem and have actively assisted the government in self-regulation and inspection. This may achieve considerable results in the future of anti-smuggling efforts. However, in the view of the conference, the cooperative efforts of the government and the industrial and commercial sectors to combat smuggling are only a passive defense against smuggling. Only when the entire population is aware of the imminent threat of national subjugation and extinction, and unites to promote national goods and use national goods, can we make a final stand against smuggling and truly eliminate smuggled goods. At the opening of this conference, "we hereby encourage ourselves with this message, and also encourage the people of the country. We respectfully ask for your understanding and observation. This is our declaration."</p>

<p>American Dr. Falconner Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that Dr. Falconner of the United States, embracing the ambitious goal of flying around the world in seventeen days, arrived in Shanghai on Thursday. Mr. Falconner departed from his hometown in Texas and flew to Lakehurst, New Jersey, where he transferred to the Hindenburg airship and headed east, crossing the Atlantic Ocean and arriving in Frankfurt, Germany. He then flew to Amsterdam and caught a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight to Penang, marking the tenth day since his departure from his hometown. However, his travel speed has slowed down slightly because Pan American's Pacific aviation business has not yet extended to Macau. Therefore, he came to Shanghai on the President Jackson, and may wait until Pacific aviation extends to Macau in September before continuing his journey. According to Mr. Falconner's estimate, it will take a week to fly from Macau to his hometown, so he can complete the feat of flying around the world in two and a half weeks. In the future, he may rent a plane from Hong Kong to fly to Macau, so that not a single foot of the 30,000-mile journey will be on the ground. Mr. Falconner booked a through ticket with the American Express Company at a cost of US$3,305, of which the Hindenburg cost US$400. As far as safety is concerned, the Graf Zeppelin airship has flown to South America 104 times, carrying 30,000 passengers, without any accidents. In the future, when the various routes are connected, flying around the world will become a common occurrence. Mr. Falconner had previously traveled around the world four times, and this time he is doing it out of curiosity, planning to write about his experiences for North American newspapers. Because he is passing through in a hurry, he cannot observe everything in detail, but he will stay for a few days in interesting places along the way. He left his hometown on May 8th and arrived in Penang on May 28th, spending a few days in New York in between. After arriving in Hong Kong, he stayed for a week and will stay for some time in China and Japan. Mr. Falconner graduated from Harvard Medical School and previously served as a civil affairs official in the American government, stationed in Manila for several years.</p>
<h3 id="e96">French Concession to Collect Police Tax on Vacant Houses <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Because They Need to be Taken Care of by the Police and Fire Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the French Concession's Board of Directors passed a new regulation on June 22 stipulating that a portion of the police tax will be levied on all shops and apartments that have been built but are unoccupied. This has led to rumors that all vacant houses will be subject to the police tax. However, an official from the Board of Directors denied this yesterday, saying that according to the new regulations, shops that have been built but are unoccupied will be charged 50% of the Concession police tax, which is 65% of the rent. Apartments that have been built but are unoccupied will be charged 75%, which is 97.5% of the rent. Landlords who want to charge high rents or rent out quickly will be willing to pay this tax. The implementation of the new regulations is because all built houses need to be taken care of by the police and fire department. As for houses that are vacant due to residents being away, no tax will be collected.</p>

Whether these two lottery tickets have been approved and whether they should be banned was specifically inquired of the Ministry of Finance for verification and reply. In addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan a few days ago, cabling an order to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to instruct a halt, the Executive Yuan also requested that the Yuan send telegrams to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering them to strictly prohibit sales in order to avoid hindering the promotion of aviation highway construction lottery tickets.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Thirteen Silk Factories in the Xinzha District Completely Strike <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Because the Factories Refused to Restore Original Wages, the Social Affairs Bureau Called Both Parties for Mediation Yesterday Without Results</p>
<p>— Factories in the Hongkou and Southern Shanghai Districts Shifted to Half-Day Work Yesterday —</p>
<p>The Dagong She reported that the silk workers in thirteen silk factories along Guangfu Road in the Xinzha District of this city, due to the factories' refusal to restore original wages, declared a joint strike starting on the 7th of this month. The Social Affairs Bureau specially summoned both labor and management to the bureau yesterday afternoon for mediation. Other silk factories in the Hongkou and Zhabei Nanshi districts of the Concession, a total of thirty factories, have switched to half-day work due to the hot weather. The Dagong She reporter has investigated and recorded the details below.</p>
<p>Joint Strike of Silk Factories in Xinzha</p>
<p>The silk factories in Xinzhabei that are operating include Da Feng and Cheng Feng (Guangfu Road), Hong Tai and Xie Xing and Yi Chang (Hengfeng Road), Tai Lun and Fu Chang II factories (Chang'an Road), Ji Yu and Jiu Yu (Gonghe Road) and other thirteen silk factories, employing approximately 16,000 female workers. The silk factory wages in this city before the January 28th Incident were 6 jiao per day, but were changed to 5 jiao 1 fen after the January 28th Incident. The wage was reduced to 3 jiao 8 fen in the year before last. Last year, due to a slight improvement in the silk market, the wage was increased to 4 jiao per day. After the factories in this district started work this year, the silk workers demanded the restoration of 5 jiao 5 fen per day, but the factories could not afford it, resulting in no resolution. After the meal break in the afternoon of the 7th of this month, the female workers of the Tai Lun silk factory in Chang'an Road first refused to enter the factory to work, resulting in a strike. This then spread to Xie Xing silk factory and Hong Tai silk factory and neighboring silk factories. Fearing the strike, workers came to cause trouble, so they unanimously released the workers who were working, and they did not resume work on the morning of the 8th, holding out until yesterday, which was the third day, and they still had not resumed work.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Announces the Strike Process</p>
<p>The Dagong She reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Sixth District Silk Workers Union yesterday and spoke about the fact that silk workers' organizations in this city have been extremely scattered in the past, and management has also been difficult because of their low level of education. In order to achieve sound organization and facilitate training, the union has applied to the party and government agencies to handle worker registration. However, this work can only be completed with the cooperation of labor and management, but a small number of management personnel do not understand the truth and have expressed suspicion, so the work has not been carried out. Regarding this labor dispute, although the workers are demanding the restoration of wages, the organizational aspect also has a considerable impact, so it is hoped that the labor dispute will be resolved as soon as possible, and the factories should support the union in carrying out worker registration, so that labor disputes can be reduced in the future. Furthermore, after the union's persuasion, the silk factories in other areas have understood the truth, so there will be no more labor disputes.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Mediation Yields No Results</p>
<p>In order to prevent the expansion of the labor dispute, the political and government authorities specially summoned both labor and management to the bureau at 2 PM yesterday for mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. Yuan Yunlong and Yang Gengti of the Sixth District Silk Workers Union, Shen Huachen and Zhang Peishen of the Trade Association, and Zhu Yangwu representing the Municipal Party Department attended. After inquiring about the situation, Zhu Guilin, chairman of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, proposed that labor restore 5 jiao 1 fen per day, and management only agreed to add 4 fen per day, which is 4 jiao 4 fen, and shorten the working hours by one hour. Because the two sides' opinions did not come close, there was no result. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled another mediation for 9 AM on Tuesday. On the workers' side, the strike will continue.</p>
<p>Other Factories Shift to Half-Day Work</p>
<p>Recently, due to the hot weather and the sluggishness of the overseas silk market, ten factories in the Hongkou District, such as Xingchangxiang and Chengfuren, three factories in the Concession District, such as Ewo, Xin Chang, and Tong Yu, seventeen factories in the Zhabei District, such as Yu Feng, Xing Lun, Hengtai Zhicheng, Yu Feng, and two factories in the Nanshi District, such as Guangyuan and Baotai, a total of thirty-two silk factories, have reduced working hours to half-day work starting yesterday. The working hours are from 5 AM to 12 PM, and all work is stopped and rested in the afternoon. Once the weather cools down, full-day shifts will resume.</p>

<p>Police Department to Specify Temporary Traffic Regulations</p>
<p>The 14th of this month is the French National Day. In order to celebrate enthusiastically, the French Concession authorities have scheduled a military parade at Gujiazhai Park at 7:45 AM on that day. It is expected that there will be heavy traffic at that time, which will inevitably be crowded. In order to maintain order, the Police Department has designated the following locations around Gujiazhai Park where cars are allowed to park (from 7 AM until the end of the military parade): Hualong Road (from Avenue Joffre to Huailong Road), Huailong Road (north end from the French School to Avenue Massenet), Avenue Massenet (east end from Huailong Road to Avenue Lafayette), and Avenue Lafayette (from Rue Luber to Avenue Massenet). Parking is prohibited. Vehicles passing through the French Concession on that day should follow the following measures: Cars and other vehicles driving from Hualong Road to the park should turn west onto Huailong Road and are allowed to park on the north side of Huailong Road, west of the French School gate, on Avenue Corneille and the north side of Avenue Molière. Vehicles parked on Huailong Road should have their front ends facing west and should not move on that road. Rickshaws heading from Hualong Road to the park should turn east onto Avenue Doumer and are allowed to park via Rue Luber to Avenue Messeroty. Vehicles (cars) to the south gate of the park should park on the west end of Rue Luber and Avenue Lafayette. Other vehicles and rickshaws should stop on the east end of Rue Luber and Avenue Lafayette.</p>

<p>Yu Qiaqing, Jin Tingsun, Zhu Shoumei, and others from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, convened a meeting at Jin's residence on Henry Road the night before last to discuss purchasing an airplane as a birthday gift. They drafted a notice to fellow townsmen, which reads as follows: "How does one achieve longevity? By understanding the principles of health and wellness. How does a nation achieve longevity? By possessing strong national defense. Now, there is a tool that can both extend the life of the nation and be used to celebrate the birthday of an individual, as demonstrated by the nationwide initiative of various sectors to purchase an airplane as a birthday gift. This year, we are delighted to celebrate the 50th birthday of our fellow townsman, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. People from all over are launching initiatives to collect funds and purchase a domestically manufactured airplane to present to the government as a birthday gift for Chairman Chiang. This is because Chairman Chiang's longevity is synonymous with the longevity of the Republic of China, and purchasing an airplane to strengthen national defense is the most important step in ensuring the long-term survival of our nation. Therefore, based on our patriotic zeal and as an expression of our support for our leader, the intention is beautiful, and the method is excellent. We, the Ningbo people in Shanghai, believe that our enthusiasm for this endeavor, both to protect our country and to honor our hometown, will be extraordinary. We, the members of this association, bear this mission and dare to announce this initiative to our fellow townsmen. It must be understood that collecting funds to purchase an airplane to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday is also celebrating the birthday of the Republic of China. As the saying goes, 'Who does not love their country as much as I do?' and 'Many minds can build a city.' Our dear fellow townsmen, let us rise to the occasion! The fund-raising methods of this association are as follows: Funds will be collected in groups, with each group aiming to raise 2,000 yuan. For those who raise 2,000 yuan, this association will request the government to present them with an honorary plaque. Collection points: Siming Bank, Dalai Bank, Fuyuan Exchange, Hengxun Exchange.

<p>Major theaters, movie theaters, amusement parks, and dance halls in this city are enthusiastically supporting the donation of funds to purchase airplanes and present them to the government as a memorial for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. They are successively setting aside one day of their income to be used as donations to purchase airplanes to celebrate his birthday, with excellent results. Details have already been reported in various newspapers. The Shanghai Grand Theater at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road is donating its entire income on the 12th for the purchase of airplanes as a birthday gift. There will be four showings: 3:00 PM, 5:15 PM, 7:15 PM, and 9:15 PM. Ticket prices are 40 cents downstairs and 70 cents or one yuan upstairs. The movie is "Men or Wings."

<p>Zhentai Egg Shop sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, stating, "To the esteemed gentlemen of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, with respect, our shop originally had a three-wheeled delivery vehicle, with French Concession certificate number 176. Since its purchase, we have been accustomed to obtaining a license with this number for operation. Yesterday (July 8th) at around 11 AM, in accordance with the regulations, our shop sent someone to the French Concession Vehicle Office to obtain the autumn license. Unexpectedly, a French police officer there, without asking for any explanation, forcibly dragged the person our shop sent to obtain the license upstairs. He then took out a certificate with the same number and claimed that the certificate held by our shop was a forgery. When the person tried to defend himself, the French police officer started to beat him. Under coercion, he was immediately fined two yuan. The person our shop sent was not only wronged and insulted but also unreasonably fined. Thinking about it, we feel deeply pained. How can there be such a reason in the world? We believe that your association has always upheld justice and has long been praised by the Chinese people. Therefore, we are writing this letter to you and imploring you to make every effort to negotiate with the office, retrieve the fine, and severely punish the unreasonable French police officer to uphold the law and reassure the people. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable. With hurried brushstrokes, we anxiously await your response. Respectfully submitted, Zhentai Egg Shop, with one soft photo, two hard photos, and one fine ticket attached."</p>

<h3 id="e109">After Heated Debate by Lawyers for Both Sides, the Japanese Sailor Case Concludes Yesterday; Prosecutor Zhang Chongru's Opinion on the Case; Ye Haisheng and Others Lack Sufficient Criminal Suspicion; Court Schedules Sentencing for Next Friday Morning <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2 PM, the First Special District Court continued to investigate the case of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, who died from a gunshot wound by a sniper. Judge Qian Hongye, along with Judges Xiao Xiefen and Feng Shide, and Prosecutor Zhang Chongru, and Clerk Ding Chongnan, ascended to the first criminal court. After ordering the defendants Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong to be brought forward, Lawyer Ru Bao, representing the police station in the prosecution, immediately stated that there was still a witness, a Portuguese man, who last year on the night of November 9th, in Room 4 of the Yuegong Hotel, witnessed Ye Haisheng returning from committing the crime and talking with a guest in Room 9. This witness had already been summoned and could testify about Ye's demeanor at the time of the conversation. The court then ordered the Portuguese man to the witness stand and questioned him. According to the translated testimony, he worked for the Salvation Society and that night went to Room 4 of the Yuegong Hotel to visit a Cantonese friend, Li Tian. He then saw the door of Room 9 half-open, with Ye Haisheng's foot across the threshold, his face pale. The guest in Room 9, Lin Renxiao, asked him why he looked like that. Ye replied that he had just returned from a fight outside. The Portuguese man also testified that he knew Yang Wendao from the Guangdong Club in Guangzhou several years ago, and he knew Zhou Sherong there as well, but only for a short time. He knew Ye Haisheng from the</p>
<p>dance hall. The court questioned the three defendants, Yang, and the others, all of whom admitted to knowing the Portuguese man. Zhou even stated that when he was arrested at the Mainland Dance Hall this time, the man identified himself as a detective. Ye Haisheng then claimed that although he knew the man, he had been beaten up, and that his statements were purely fictional. At this point in the questioning, all the witnesses had testified. The lawyers for both sides then began their verbal arguments, unleashing their eloquent tongues. First, the prosecuting lawyer, Ru Bao, detailed the entire case from beginning to end, and based on various pieces of evidence and testimonies, asserted that the defendants should bear joint</p>
<p>responsibility for murder. He presented his reasons in detail for over an hour and fifteen minutes. He stated that after the court's thorough investigation, what needed attention was the various pieces of evidence to determine if the defendants were involved in the murder. The fact that Nakayama Hideo died from a gunshot wound was undisputed. After the incident, no fewer than one or two hundred police officers from the police station and Japanese military command investigated the scene, and many onlookers gathered. After two hours of investigation, a handgun bullet and shell casing were found and taken back to the police station for inspection (it was determined that this was the murder weapon. The investigation of the murderer then began. At the time, a woman, now</p>
<p>departed from Shanghai, Pu Qiaoying, and Hu Xianghe, who had previously been summoned to testify, happened to pass the scene and witnessed the two murderers fleeing. Based on their descriptions and other information, the defendants were arrested. Furthermore, because Ye Haisheng confessed that the handgun was given to him by Yang Wendao, Yang's home was searched, and the book in which the handgun was hidden was found. Later, Yang claimed that the book had been framed, which led to questions of a swap and false accusation. However, after thorough investigation and the testimony of various witnesses proving that Yang Wendao admitted to the situation when the book was found and brought back to the police station, it was clear that the physics book belonged to Yang and there was no doubt. Yang tried to deny everything, and cunningly claimed that the</p>
<p>book in which he hid the handgun was a different book, and that the handgun was also different. However, when the police station retrieved the handgun with the serial number provided by Yang and placed it in the hole in this book, it did not fit at all. This showed that the hole in this book could only hold the murder weapon. His claim of being framed was not credible. If the hole in the book was dug by someone else, how could it fit this gun so perfectly? Furthermore, the gun had only been taken by the Japanese military command for nine days since it was found, and the rest of the time it was in the custody of the police station. There was no way for others to have the opportunity to copy it exactly. Moreover, the rust on the gun matched the rust on the book in over forty-two points. There was no</p>
<p>opportunity for forgery, and there were so many similarities, how could he deny it? In conclusion, this gun was the murder weapon, and the book in which the gun was hidden was found in Yang's home. Although Yang denied that the book was his original book, claiming that Yang Jianzhong had framed him, and repeatedly claimed ignorance about the case, without other strong evidence to the contrary, he could not escape his guilt. As for Ye Haisheng, when he was arrested in Qingdao, he did not know that Yang had already been arrested and the murder weapon had been found, so he still tried to deny it. Later, when he learned that the evidence was irrefutable and there was no room for denial, he confessed without hesitation during the third interrogation. Afterwards, with each</p>
<p>interrogation, his confession became clearer. He was not an ignorant person, and knew the seriousness of the crime of murder. If he was not involved, why would he risk admitting to it? However, during the interrogation on May 27th, he suddenly recanted his confession, claiming that his previous confessions were due to torture by the police station. When the defendant's lawyer visited Ye at the police station on May 21st, Ye told his lawyer that the police station treated him very well and did not mention being tortured. Moreover, when the judge inspected the scene of the incident on May 20th, if Ye had been wronged, he could have refused to reenact the crime, as the police station would not have tortured him at that time. However, he calmly reenacted the scene of the crime from beginning to end, and even corrected the testimony of witness Hu Xianghe regarding Ye's escape</p>
<p>route after the shooting. This proved that the reenactment was voluntary and must have matched the facts. Unexpectedly, he acted the way he did on the 27th, and cried in court about the types of torture he had suffered, claiming that one was burning his lips with cigarettes, and another was pouring tap water into his nose. Because he could not bear the torture, he secretly swallowed a copper key he had hidden on his person to commit suicide. However, the police station conducted thorough searches of the suspects, ensuring that they had nothing on them. Later, Ye was sent to a mountain hospital, where an X-ray showed that there was no metal in his stomach. Ye then claimed that what he swallowed must have been excreted. The slight injuries on his lips were also examined and proven not to be burns. Even if the police station had</p>
<p>used torture, it must have been used on those who were trying to evade the law. If Ye had already confessed repeatedly, there was no need to torture him. If it was believed that torture would force Ye to make a false confession, then why not torture Yang and Zhou as well? Although Ye presented evidence to the contrary, he could only prove his whereabouts on November 8th and 10th, but not on the 9th when the incident occurred. As for Zhou Sherong, Ye confessed that he had participated in the conspiracy, making him an accomplice. He should be sentenced to death for murder. Then, Lawyer Ge Zhaoji defended Yang Wendao and Zhou Sherong, saying that Yang Wendao originally had a</p>
<p>book in which he hid a handgun, and that Yang Jianzhong taught him how to dig the hole in 1934. Because there were many children in the defendant's family, hiding it this way would avoid danger. The book suddenly disappeared in February of this year, and he only saw it again on the day it was found. Therefore, the defendant suspected that Yang Jianzhong had swapped this book for the original book to frame him. Zhou Sherong had nothing to do with the case and should be declared innocent. Lawyer Guo Qiming also defended Yang once more. Ye Haisheng's appointed lawyers, Zhang Zhirang and Fan Gang, then spoke. Lawyer Zhang used the forensic institute's report as the focus of his defense, asserting that the three defendants</p>
<p>were not involved. The person who killed Nakayama Hideo was a third party. The main point was that the report stated that the deceased's injury was caused by someone very close to him, so the shooter must have been walking shoulder to shoulder with the deceased and could not have been Ye. The investigation showed that on the day the deceased was attacked, he went to four brothels from morning to night. This showed that he was quite amorous and welcomed by the prostitutes. He left the brothel at 8:40 PM and was shot on the way. It was clear that his death was due to a love rivalry. The fact that Ye and others were implicated was purely the result of</p>
<p>people trying to obtain a reward, a fabricated act. Yang Wendao did not examine the book carefully at first and assumed that it was his original book. Under pressure, he mistook a deer for a horse. Yang Jianzhong was Wendao's nephew, and he was willing to report his uncle's address to those who wanted to get to his uncle. Why would he hesitate to swap the book? The locations where the bullet and shell casing were found were not where the sailor fell, and it was difficult to prove that the bullet had been stained with blood. Therefore, it could not be determined that the sailor's injury was caused by this gun and bullet. Furthermore, what was found in Yang's home was not a handgun, but only a book for hiding a gun. Therefore, Yang was not suspected of any crime. Ye Haisheng had</p>
<p>nothing to do with the gun and bullets. Although he confessed to being the murderer, there were many contradictions between his confession and the facts of the case, so it was difficult to believe. He should be acquitted. Then, Lawyer Fan and Lawyer Tang Huaiqun and Lawyer Wang Shizong, representing Zhou Sherong, finished their arguments. Prosecutor Zhang then gave his opinion, stating that Yang Wendao initially admitted that the book was his, but later claimed that Yang Jianzhong had secretly swapped it. Considering the relationship between the two, Jianzhong certainly had the possibility of making the swap. The results of the forensic examination also determined that the book</p>
<p>appeared to be forged. Therefore, the evidence of Wendao's crime was weak and insufficient. Although Ye Haisheng had confessed, his reenactment was often contrary to the facts. Furthermore, in the days before and after Nakayama Hideo's death, Ye's behavior was normal and showed no abnormalities. From this perspective, the suspicion of crime was also insufficient. Zhou Sherong was even less involved. He should be judged according to the law. Judge Qian then scheduled sentencing for next Friday (the 17th) morning. Yang and the others were returned to custody, and the court adjourned at 6 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Shantytown Residents in the Eastern District Complain <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Due to the Municipal Council's Order to Demolish, They Requested the Municipal Federation to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Due to the Municipal Council's limited order to demolish shantytowns in the Eastern District, representatives Sun Hankui, Wang Qitai, Yang Jingchen, Guo Zhizhi, Gu Xuebo, Jia Zidong, Tang Anping, Jiang Shanchang, Zhang Buyun, Xu Yangguang, Ji Yunsheng, Yin Yifu, Liu Xuede, Wang Ruyu, Sun Xuzhou, Wang Daomeng, and over ten others, went to the First Special District Municipal Federation in the afternoon at 2 PM to petition. Secretary Zhao Ziyun of the Federation received them. Their petition stated: "To the gentlemen of the Shanghai Municipal Federation, we, the shantytown residents of the East Shanghai District, number approximately five thousand households or more. Recently, the Municipal Council came to inspect our shantytowns and ordered us to move out voluntarily within one month, otherwise they will forcibly demolish them. We, more than five thousand shantytown households, are extremely terrified by this news. We are not resisting the Municipal Council's order, but we are truly in unbearable pain. Because the market is sluggish, the economy is shrinking, industry is withering, and the countryside is bankrupt, all industries are in decline. No one can deny that Chinese industry has stopped, closed down, and is being realized simultaneously. The wages in Japanese cotton mills are low, and the construction industry is also hanging up signs that they are not starting work. Even the Municipal Council, in order to provide temporary work, has dismissed permanent workers and established five-day shifts. Nine out of ten homes are empty. We shantytown residents have also reached a critical juncture. Because young and strong people work only half a month, earning an average of four jiao per day, and rely on six yuan per month. If it is just one person, they can barely survive. Otherwise, which family does not have elderly and young? We cannot steal, so we have to use this little salary to buy bean dregs and broken rice, and cook yellow vegetable peels, barely getting by on two meals a day, like the model of a beggar, which can be seen in an instant. Moreover, the Municipal Council cares about the suffering of the people, but although we are within the concession, we have not committed any crimes. If we are considered unsanitary, we have always followed the Council's guidance. If it is for the sake of the asset-rich buildings, and we are asked to demolish our homes to live in those buildings, it would be very difficult to do so. Because our three-day shift wages are not enough to cover the rent. Even if we cannot afford to rent a house, disputes and conflicts are inevitable. If we want to return to our hometowns, there is no land to cultivate, and we do not even have travel expenses. With no home to return to, we endure the pain and seek to survive. Therefore, we implore your esteemed Federation to uphold justice for us and find a way to stop this, so that both industry and commerce can be reassured and the suffering of the weak can be alleviated."</p>

<p>Factory Supervisor Interferes Leading to Tragic Accident Due to Female Worker's Mishap</p>
<p>Tian Yang, a woman from Yancheng who resides on Rue Robert in West Shanghai and works at the Shengyuan Silk Factory, had a three-month-old daughter named Sanmei. She brought her to the factory every day. Because the child was crying incessantly, another female worker, Zhang Sanmei, held her by the factory window to look around. A local factory supervisor named Wang Jinkang passed by and immediately interfered and pushed her. Zhang Sanmei retreated to avoid being pushed, and the child fell out of the window, landing on the ground and becoming almost a meat patty. She died instantly. Tian Yang reported the incident to the police station, and Wang Jinkang was arrested and taken to court. Prosecutor Xiao prosecuted him under Article 276, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Judge Cai opened the court to hear the case yesterday morning at 9 AM. Tian Yang was in court and requested 400 yuan in private compensation. Zhang Sanmei also testified, stating that Wang Jinkang abused his authority as a supervisor, disregarding human life. When questioned, Wang Jinkang claimed that Zhang Sanmei was distracted while looking out the window and carelessly dropped the child, blaming him. He asked for a clear investigation. The judge stated that the case required investigation and adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Longhua Temple Monk Indecency Case Concluded <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing on the 17th</p>
<p>Hongkui, the 46-year-old Sichuanese vice-abbot of Longhua Temple, also known as the chief monk, was accused of sodomy by Yang Shouchang, a fifteen-year-old temple helper. The Longhua Temple abbot, Lu Mingzhao, sent Yang to the district court, where the injury to his anus was verified. A police officer, Wu Xijun, from the Zhendong Wuxi police station, was dispatched to Longhua Temple to arrest Hongkui. Prosecutor Xie Lian filed a public indictment, stating that on the night of the 28th day of the third lunar month of this year, the defendant used violent means in his room to commit indecency against Yang Shouchang, a worker at the temple, and confined him in the room overnight. Shouchang entrusted Lu Mingzhao, a donor to the temple, to report the case. Although the defendant denied the allegations, Yang Shouchang clearly and accurately identified the details, and it was verified that Shouchang's anus did have signs of indecency. The defendant was charged with violating Article 224, Paragraph 1, and Article 302, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court. The defendant hired Lawyer Yang Maomao to defend him. The judge, considering the case involved morals, prohibited spectators. However, the defendant had a written statement claiming that he was being framed for indecency, extorted, slandered, and ostracized in an attempt to seize power. He claimed that he had been at the temple for nearly three years and had served the temple. Monks Huizheng, Yueqiao, and others had repeatedly tried to take his position as vice-abbot, which they had only managed to do last month. Buddhist laymen Wang Yiting, Zhu Qinglan, Qu Yingguang, and Huang Qinglan had introduced him to become the abbot of Ruiguang Temple in Suzhou. Unexpectedly, he had provoked resentment again. Because the monk was scheduled to go to Suzhou to take over the temple on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, they colluded with the tea boy Wang Zhaowen on the sixth day to bribe Yang Shouchang to write a letter claiming that the monk had harassed him on the twenty-second day of the third lunar month, demanding that the monk go abroad and pay 100 yuan. The monk dismissed it as absurd, and Huizheng and Yueqiao beat the monk. The monk reported it to Officer Liu of the Longhua Branch Police Station for investigation. The monk was scheduled to hold a succession ceremony on July 7, and the invitations had already been printed. Huizheng and Yueqiao were jealous and incited Yang Shouchang to falsely accuse him. He cited guest monk Ti Yong and incense-burning monk Ruyi as witnesses and requested that they be questioned on the spot. However, after reviewing the entire file, the judge found that the evidence he presented could not be adopted and therefore instructed that no questioning would take place. After a thorough examination of the cases of both parties, and after the prosecutor presented his opinion, the debate was concluded and the sentencing was scheduled for the 17th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Unmarried Daughter's Estate After Death Leads to Lawsuit Among Relatives</p>
<p>Sun Jingchen, a wealthy merchant from Anhui, had one son and two daughters. His eldest son was named Binshan, his second daughter was named Jizhang, and his youngest daughter was named Yizhang. Binshan married Zhu Lingxian and had four children: Wenkui, Wenlan, Wenda, and Hongyu. Jizhang married into the Tao family, and Yizhang remained single. Binshan died ten years ago, leaving behind his eldest son, Wenkui, who is now twenty-two years old. Sun Jingchen also passed away in 1931. Because he left behind a large estate, there was a lawsuit, which was later settled. At that time, Sun Yizhang alone received the land and buildings at 470 Lane, Donghan Bili Road, Chang Le Li, totaling 1.182 mu, a part of the land at the corner of Tiantong Road and Wusong Road, Yang Li, totaling 2.833 mu, and 28,000 yuan in cash. On May 29th of this year, Sun Yizhang also passed away. Because she had always been single and had no adopted children, all of her estate was managed by her sister, Tao Sun Jizhang. However, Sun Wenkui and the others claimed that according to Article 1138 of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, they should also have inheritance rights to this estate. They hired lawyers Lin Yingqing and Shi Jun to file a lawsuit against Tao Sun Jizhang, requesting a judgment confirming that the plaintiffs had the right to inherit one-half of Sun Yizhang's estate and ordering immediate payment. Fearing that the defendant would dispose of the assets privately, they requested a preliminary execution. Judge Zhang Yuhai of the First Special Court heard the case in the Civil Division Four courtroom yesterday morning. Tao Sun Jizhang also hired lawyers Wu Zhiping and Fang Jiazhen to defend her. Her defense was that Article 1140 of the Civil Code stipulates that if an heir in the first order specified in Article 1138 dies or loses the right to inherit before the commencement of inheritance, their lineal descendants will inherit by substitution, and the third order will have no right to inherit. Therefore, the facts alleged by the plaintiffs in this case are without merit, and the plaintiffs' lawsuit should be dismissed. Both sides debated this legal issue fiercely. After Judge Zhang reviewed the documents, he declared the hearing closed and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>After Mediation by Friends and Relatives, Relationship with Dancer Ends; Three Parties Sign Agreement in Court</p>
<p>Li Mingde, a 30-year-old from Ningbo, was formerly an accountant at the Japanese Osaka Wharf. He married a woman surnamed Cao, also from Ningbo, ten years ago and they have five children. Recently, Li Cao discovered that her husband, Li Mingde, was having an affair with a local woman, Fan Meimei, a 19-year-old dancer formerly employed at the Xin Dali Dance Hall on Sichuan Road. He had built a golden house for her at 75 Lane, 781 Tangshan Road. On the night of June 30th, she reported this information to the Hongkou Police Station. Officer Xu Bingnan was immediately ordered to investigate 75 Lane, 781 Tangshan Road, where he found Li Mingde and the dancer Fan Meimei in the same room. He reported back to the police station, which filed a public indictment with the First Special Court. The court issued a summons and brought Li and Fan to the Fifth Criminal Court yesterday morning. Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them under Article 239 of the Criminal Code for adultery and stated the facts of the case. The second defendant, Fan Meimei, was working as a dancer at the Xin Dali Dance Hall on Sichuan Road in 1934 and became involved with the first defendant, Li Mingde, and cohabited on Tangshan Road. She has already borne a daughter. Li Mingde's wife, Li Cao, found out and reported it to the police station at 2 AM on the 1st of this month. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and verified the facts, so they filed a lawsuit according to the law. It is now said that Fan Meimei is eight months pregnant. Li Cao, 30 years old, from Ningbo, stated that she had been married to Li Mingde for ten years. Recently, Li claimed that he was going to the port for business, but one day she saw him on the tram and began to investigate, eventually learning the truth. If her husband can correct his ways and make a statement in court that he will end his relationship with Fan, she is willing to withdraw the charges. When questioned, Li Mingde admitted to having an affair with Fan Meimei and stated that friends and relatives had already discussed the matter with Li Cao and that he was willing to end his relationship with Fan Meimei. Judge Ye Juchao had Li Cao, Li Mingde, and Fan Meimei sign an agreement in court and then ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>

Wu, along with his tenants, Jiao Changgui and his wife, testified and reported this to the police station. Zhang Xiangmou found out about this and harbored resentment. On the morning of June 2nd of this year, at approximately 5 AM, he went to 3 Tonghe Lane, Foch Road, with Wu Chen, and shot and killed Jiao Changgui, and wounded Jiao's wife. After the incident, the murderer Zhang Xiangmou and Wu Chen were arrested on the scene and sent to the First Special Court.

<h3 id="e120">Fujian Native Association: A Proposal to Assist Fellow Provincials in Wenzhou <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Wenzhou Fujian Guildhall recently faced a situation where the land on which the guildhall was located was misrepresented by the Sha Tin Commissioner stationed in Yongqing, who, with the approval of the Zhejiang Department of Finance, forcibly put it up for auction. Mr. Ding Wenzao was specially dispatched to Shanghai to appeal to the Shanghai Fujian Native Association for assistance. As this matter concerns the interests of fellow provincials, the case was brought before the Standing Committee for discussion. Mr. Ding attended the meeting and reported that the land managed by the Fujian Guildhall in Ou was purchased and donated by fellow provincial Mr. Wu and others during the Daoguang era of the former Qing Dynasty for the guildhall's use. After completing all procedures such as reporting, registration, and tax payment, the land was reclaimed from the sand and developed into its current state, requiring countless efforts and significant financial investment before the guildhall could manage it. This has been the case for over a hundred years. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, four mu and some odd land adjacent to the northern boundary was flooded with yellow sand. The local authorities reported it to the Reclamation Bureau for purchase. The bureau stated that although the guildhall's original land had been taxed for a long time, it was still considered official reclaimed land according to regulations and required reporting, inspection, measurement, and payment before purchase. The guildhall members, being travelers in a foreign land, dared not resist and paid the assessed land price in full, receiving a formal receipt and awaiting imperial approval for the issuance of a deed. After repeated urging, it was never completed. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Reclamation Bureau was renamed the Sha Tin Bureau. The guildhall again followed regulations and submitted the formal receipt, original purchase contract, tax receipts, and other evidence for verification, which was deemed legal, and four registration certificates were issued, allowing the guildhall to manage the property. Unexpectedly, recently, the Sha Tin Commissioner stationed in Yongqing overturned the previous case and ordered the guildhall to pay again for the land, threatening to auction it if they did not comply. The guildhall argued that they had already completed legal procedures and paid the national tax, so why should they be subjected to further extortion? They submitted a protest, but after a long time, there was no clear response, nor was there a public announcement or notice of the auction. Suddenly, on May 30th of this year, colluding with unscrupulous gentry and secretly conspiring, the commissioner auctioned the land together with the buildings on it, abusing their power and acting like robbers. Although the town chief of Chengdong and neighboring merchants and residents protested against this injustice, their power was insufficient, and nothing could be done. Therefore, the speaker was dispatched to Shanghai to appeal to the association for support. Finally, various pieces of evidence were presented. After hearing Mr. Ding's report and examining the evidence, the standing committee members of the native association all agreed that the guildhall's procedures were complete, while the Sha Tin Commissioner stationed in Yongqing, with the approval of the Department of Finance, forcibly put the land up for auction, which was a violation of the government's repeated orders to protect the property rights of organizations. It was immediately decided to send separate telegrams to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Finance, requesting them to revoke the auction and handle the matter impartially to safeguard property rights. It is believed that the Zhejiang authorities will respect public opinion and handle the matter fairly.</p>

<p>Liu Haisu, a leader of the New Art movement, is a pioneer of the New Culture Movement. Modern art has been greatly influenced by him. His oil paintings are bold and unconventional, with a touch of academic style. Europeans have already recognized him as a master. His Chinese paintings are profound in artistic conception, clear and moist in brushwork, and vigorous and unrestrained in rendering. His brushstrokes are never careless. His bold, central brushstrokes are grand and magnificent, unmatched by others. The inscriptions on each of his works are also extremely precious. The following is a brief excerpt of some of them, which should be valued by readers. No. 15, "Lone Pine on Huangshan": Chen Duxiu inscribed, "Lone pine on Huangshan, not lonely yet lonely, lonely yet not lonely. Loneliness and non-loneliness each have their own realm, each has its own use. This is not a compromise between loneliness and non-loneliness." No. 14, "Solitary Fishing in Snowy River": Cai Yuanpei inscribed, "Knowing its white, guarding its black, pondering in a pot, who can understand." No. 14, "Solitary Fishing in Snowy River": Chen Duxiu inscribed, "The painting has the meaning of Shi Gu's integration of Chinese poetry, calligraphy, and painting. In recent times, old arts have a chance to revive. Mr. Haisu is its pioneer. This painting is one that has the intention of painting."

Ancient pines, why not "leave the true face, occasionally wield a bald brush to transform into tadpoles and dragons." No. 34, "Huangshan": Cai Yuanpei inscribed, "Towering peaks, billowing clouds, between looking up and looking down, I attain great freedom." No. 54, "The True Appearance of the Mountain Lord": He Ran Li Jian inscribed, "Haiweng painted this tiger with a central brush, using the brushwork of Wang Xizhi's dragon claws. I borrow the four characters from Helu's collection and present them as praise."

Living beings are driven and pursue, who can be like you?" No. 13, "Withered Tree": Ye Zuoheng inscribed, "Shaped like a bridge tree, divine and metallic inside. The gentleman's approach. Light and not." It is also said that the cold fragrance accompanies the green branches, and the friendship is as firm as gold and stone." Shen Enfu inscribed, "New comers of all images are withered, wanting to borrow a branch from the spring breeze, pitying you are not as charming as parrots, unable to use your mouth, what else can you do?" No. 52, "Autumn from Late Color": Teng Gu inscribed, "The tip of the brush hides blessings, the heart conceals a dragon, when the mood comes, a single stroke, even the creator is deceived. Lush and rustic, desolate and not heroic." No. 55, "Sea Eagle": Li Jian inscribed, "The vastness wants to examine the sky, the surging tide never returns, heroes still wear feathers, who can save the mad waves?"

<h3 id="e128">Salted Fish Will Be Traded in the Fish Market <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>A Discussion on Methods Will Be Held with the Salted Fish Industry on the 14th. Funds Will Be Allocated to Set Up a Retail Market to Meet the Needs of Fish Vendors</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market by the Ministry of Industry, the fish trade has been quite prosperous. The market is now planning to add a salted goods trade and build a retail market to meet the needs of fish vendors, in order to expand its business. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Board Meeting</p>
<p>The Fish Market held a meeting of the Standing Directors at the Zhonghui Building on the afternoon of the ninth (yesterday), attended by Chairman Du Yuesheng, Standing Directors Fang Jiaobo, Gui Yanfang, Tang Chengzong, General Manager Wang Xiaolai, and Deputy Managers Zhu Guankai and Sun Guchen, to discuss ways to improve the fish market and other issues. The meeting lasted a long time before it adjourned.</p>
<p>Calling Salted Fish Industry to Join</p>
<p>Since the market opened on May 12, it has been during the peak season, and the fish business has been quite prosperous. However, the trade of various fish products has not yet been centralized. The reason for this is that the facilities for fish product trading are not yet complete. Therefore, currently, only seafood and river fish are traded in the market. Salted goods, which account for a large annual sales volume, have not yet joined. It is now known that the market has made arrangements for the salted goods trade. Therefore, the Board of Directors has decided that the salted goods trade will also be conducted in the market. The Board of Directors has now notified the Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association to send representatives to the Board of Directors meeting at the Zhonghui Bank at 2:00 PM on the 14th to discuss the salted fish trade, the method of joining cooperation, and various procedural issues, so as to realize it as soon as possible.</p>

Unexpectedly, when the car arrived at the entrance, two robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside and ordered Chen to hand over all the cash. Seeing the bad situation, Chen shouted "Catch the robbers!" at the entrance. The two robbers, in a panic, shot Chen in the buttocks, and he fell to the ground. The two robbers then searched Chen's pockets, robbed him of more than $800 in cash, and fled. Chen's family members and others were informed and chased after them, but the robbers had already fled without a trace. The case was immediately reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, who dispatched a car to send Chen to the hospital for treatment and dispatched detectives to search for the robbers.</p>

All aspects of ancient coins, including the origin and evolution of ancient coins, ancient coin works of all dynasties, and ancient coin collectors, were extensively cited and carefully examined, harmoniously and thoroughly, standing shoulder to shoulder with Liu's Ancient Coin Garden and Li's Ancient Coin Collection. The original manuscript was annotated by Liu Yanting, who personally proofread it, but it was not published. After the Gengzi Incident, Zhao Xiaolu of Anqiu obtained the book and treasured it, unwilling to show it to others. The members of the Coin Society plan to have it engraved and printed, so that it can be widely circulated, allowing those who previously could not get it to read it. This is indeed a great event. In addition, the first issue of the Coin Society's publication, Ancient Coin Studies, has been published. The content is rich, especially with many famous works. The Medical Book Bureau and the Shanghai Magazine Company are both acting as sales agents.</p>

<p>Special Prize...Still 25,000 Yuan</p>
<p>First, Second, Third, and Fourth Prizes Increased to Nine of Each</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Central Savings Society has been extremely generous to its depositors, so its business has been very prosperous. The first lottery had only over 9,000 numbers, and the special prize was 25,000 yuan. The society had to subsidize more than 20,000 yuan. By the second and third lotteries, the society still fully subsidized the special prize of 25,000 yuan, and the first, second, third, and fourth prizes also increased gradually each time. It is heard that the fourth lottery will be held publicly at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on July 15th. The special prize will still be 25,000 yuan, which the society guarantees to fully subsidize. The first, second, third, and fourth prizes will be increased to as many as nine each due to the increased number of membership numbers. With more prizes, it is easier to win. It is heard that the special prize winner in the last lottery was Ms. Qiu Ji of this city, who had only been a member for two months and actually won a huge amount of prize money. She voluntarily added a membership during the prize collection. It is also heard that this afternoon and tomorrow (Sunday), the society will still be open to facilitate depositors who wish to join and make payments.</p>

<p>Xu Shunyuan, a famous porcelain artisan from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, recently shipped more than a dozen of his best works to Shanghai and is exhibiting and selling them at the New World Hotel. Among them, the best are "Gathering of Immortals at the Six Harmonies Pagoda" and "Afang Palace." The landscapes, figures, and flowers are all ingeniously crafted and lifelike. Viewers have praised them in unison. The "Gathering of Immortals" alone took seven or eight years of painstaking effort. Unfortunately, the prices are also extremely high. "Gathering of Immortals" is priced at 8,000 yuan, "Six Harmonies Pagoda" is priced at 7,000 yuan, "Afang Palace" is priced at 3,000 yuan, and the others are also expensive. Therefore, not many of these items have been sold in Shanghai. The items will be shipped to Qingdao for exhibition the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Inmate in Second Special Court Detention Center Injures Head Again <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>An inmate in the Second Special District Court Detention Center on Rue Massenet in the French Concession recently demanded that officials improve treatment. As there was no result, on the morning of the eighth, inmates charged with serious crimes such as murder and robbery gathered and shouted. As the guards and wardens were unable to stop them, they reported to the French police station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the riot. The riot subsided, and the instigating inmates, including Li Shiying and twelve others, were brought to the police station for questioning. The next day, when the inmates were sent back to the detention center, they resisted orders and disrupted the situation by refusing to enter the cells. This has been reported in this newspaper. At about 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the ninth, another inmate, Chen Jinkun (sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for robbery), suddenly refused to eat dinner and kept complaining. The warden reported to the section chief, who ordered the inmate to be brought in for questioning. As soon as the inmate left the cell, he smashed his head against the iron door, causing injury and blood on his face. After the prison doctor bandaged his wounds, he was placed in a separate room. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the warden ordered two guards to escort Chen to the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office for questioning and examination. Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan questioned him. According to Chen, he did not participate in the riot in the detention center. Last night, he was suddenly ordered to be interrogated by the warden, and he was afraid of being chained and punished, so he smashed his head against the iron door in a panic, injuring himself. It had nothing to do with anyone else, etc. Chief Qiao verified the confession and stated that since Chen had already admitted it, there was no need for further examination and ordered the guards to take him back to the detention center for detention.</p>

<p>Four Months Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years, Handed Over to Her Original Husband for Supervision</p>
<p>Wang Xiuzhen (aka Lu Wangshi aka Deng Xiuying), a young woman from Liyang, 21 years old this year, was betrothed to Lu Jincheng from the same village. She was a child bride and married him in the spring of the year before last. At the end of the year, due to famine in her hometown, she was sent to Shanghai by her aunt Lu to the home of her relative Zhang Shuifu (resident of No. 1099 Zhonghua Road), who was asked to find a job for her. Later, Zhang recommended her to work as a domestic helper, and she was brought back to her hometown in the autumn of last year. Unexpectedly, Xiuying had already been in love with someone in Shanghai and did not want to go back. Therefore, she took the opportunity to escape at the North Station and married Shen Changgen from Pudong, living with him at No. 13 Gaosheng Lane, Blue Veillée Road in the French Concession. It was not until the sixteenth of last month that Zhang Shuifu found out where she was living and reported it to the French police station, which sent detectives, including Zuo Qihong, to arrest Wang Xiuzhen and Shen Changgen's mother, Shen Huangshi, and send them to the Second Special Court. The attorney of the police department filed a public prosecution against her for bigamy. At the same time, Zhang notified her husband, Lu Jincheng, to come to Shanghai to await trial. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. The case was repeatedly heard by Judge Wang Hongxu of the Second Special Court. Lu Jincheng also testified in court, and the debate was concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang ordered Wang Xiuzhen and Shen Huangshi to be brought to court and sentenced Wang Xiuzhen to four months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, and handed over to her husband Lu Jincheng for supervision. Shen Huangshi was acquitted. After the judgment, Wang Xiuzhen was taken home by her husband, and Shen Huangshi was released.</p>

Lei Binzhang, a prosecutor from the local court, arrived at the scene and confirmed that he had indeed drowned. The family then signed a statement and took the body for burial.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been reports of traitors in various places disguising themselves as monks in the hope of evading attention and plotting wrongdoing. The Chinese Buddhist Association believes that this matter is of great importance, not only concerning the future of the monastic community, but also greatly affecting national defense. Therefore, it has specifically cabled all branches nationwide, instructing all temples to inquire about the origins of passing monks at any time, and to pay special attention to monks traveling and wandering, selecting personnel to conduct strict investigations. If anyone is found to be suspicious, they should be reported to the local police station for handling.</p>

<p>Director Bao Says Further Review Pending</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, under the mandate of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, began managing private radio stations and governing broadcast programs, it has spared no effort in scrutinizing scripts and reviewing broadcast lyrics. In addition to banning lewd and bizarre programs, it has also imposed time restrictions on Shanghai Operas, Siming storytelling, and Siming Southern Ballads. (Namely, regarding the Siming Southern Ballads, it is said that their lyrics are vulgar and the content is obscene, and some content is considered seditious. Therefore, it ordered the Shanghai Private Wireless Broadcasting Association, which, after receiving the order, sent a letter to the Ningbo Native Association, asking it to argue on the grounds that Siming storytelling and Siming Southern Ballads are not only elegant in style and melodious in tone but also pleasing and edifying, and are the most popular entertainment in society. It often immediately sent a special letter to the Telegraph Bureau, requesting permission to lift the restrictions, etc. This matter is related to the Electric Policy Law and affects private broadcasting and is extremely important. According to the Director of the Telegraph Bureau, Mr. Bao Keyong, during the process of reorganizing the broadcasting industry, the Telegraph Bureau must carefully consider the retention and removal of songs. This is because the underlying texts of songs often differ greatly from the lyrics sung during the broadcast. However, it is sometimes difficult to be fair in the categorization of songs. If the lyrics can be submitted to the bureau for detailed review and are confirmed not to conflict with social education, leniency will naturally be granted.)</p>

<p>At around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, on the Wharf Station of Huasheng Wharf on Fair Road, Yangshupu, the wharf was crowded with cool-seekers, including over a hundred sailors from various ships. The weather was extremely hot. Dai Youlin, an 18-year-old Hubei native working as a cook on the Dehe Steamer, saw many of his colleagues from Guangdong and Tianjin swimming in the river. On a whim, he also jumped in to play. Due to his poor swimming skills, he drowned. His swimming companions quickly dragged him onto the wharf, but he had swallowed too much water and was unconscious. He was taken to Renji Hospital by police vehicle No. 31. Half an hour later, he died. His body was taken to the autopsy station on Linglun Road. Subsequently, his cousin, Dai Shaoqing, was notified and learned that Chen Fa, a cook of the same ship and from the same hometown, had pushed him into the water, causing the tragedy. He reported the situation to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Cui Chengke to take Chen into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Shizhu, stated that Chen Fa denied the charges at the police station and requested temporary detention for further investigation. Following Dai Shaoqing's account of the incident, Chen Fa was questioned and insisted that the deceased was not pushed by him but had done it himself, requesting judgment. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be detained pending further investigation. Tang, the prosecutor from the court, arrived at the scene and confirmed that Dai Youlin had indeed died from drowning before death. The body was handed over to Dai Shaoqing, the deceased's cousin, to claim and arrange the funeral after signing a guarantee.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Letter <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: Today (the 10th), in the local news column of your newspaper, there was an item about Yao Guangding, the chief of the Ximen Public Security Bureau, being accused of dereliction of duty. After reading it, I was extremely surprised. It was found that on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, the plaintiff, Qiao Jinquan, filed a complaint against tenants Li Jiatong and Liang Jinshi for owing rent and relying on brute force to estimate the value, etc., and attached two rent books and property tax receipts. After investigation, it was found to be true. According to Article 14 of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Rules, a police officer was dispatched to the case and ordered the bureau to question the officers, approve the plaintiff to directly prosecute in court, and the defendant to provide bail, or be detained without bail, etc. Unexpectedly, after the defendant was sentenced, he sought bail everywhere, but could not find it all day. On the 4th of this month, he prepared a document and submitted it to the Public Security Bureau for verification. Not only was there no detention for eight days, but there was also no illegal acceptance of the case. This is all documented and cannot be fabricated. In addition to filing a lawsuit against the plaintiff for false accusation, I am sending you a letter outlining the handling of this case, and I hope you will grant a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Ximen Branch, July 10.</p>

<p>Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Feng Youzhen (Second Letter, Continued)</p>
<p>Fellowship on the Same Boat</p>
<p>Today is the last day of June. The gloomy weather has increased the terror at sea. The mail ship is forging ahead proudly in the Chinese Sea. Although it has not encountered any major storms, it is always a bit uneasy. At lunchtime, I counted the seats at the table and found that fifteen or sixteen seats were empty. People without sailing experience probably only curse such weather. After lunch, there was a heavy rain, and the sky cleared up. Everyone was lying on the rattan chairs on the deck, enjoying the breeze and the cool. Several people with sailing experience brought a lot of preserved mustard greens and pickled vegetables before departure. It is said that these two things are more effective in treating seasickness than any medicine. So everyone scrambled to eat them, as if they had obtained sweet rain in a severe drought.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, the ship held a lifeboat drill. All the ship's staff, sailors, and passengers participated in the drill. The whistle emitted a short roar, and the alarm bells rang continuously. Everyone seemed to be in real danger, rushing to their rooms to put on their life jackets and then running to the designated deck to assemble. The ship's staff guided and corrected those who wore their life jackets incorrectly. After five minutes, the whistle emitted a signal indicating that the danger had passed, and everyone was dismissed. Such a drill increases everyone's knowledge of what to do in case of danger, which is very meaningful.</p>
<p>The Conte Verde has probably set a new record for the number of Chinese passengers it has carried since its sailing history. In addition to the delegation of more than 100 athletes, there are 33 members of the World Games European Tour organized by the China Travel Service. There are also 20-30 other compatriots going to Europe, such as Mr. Pan Huaguo, the deputy military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, Mr. Deng Shuren, who is going to Germany to study military affairs, and Mr. Luo Zhijian, a famous tennis player. In total, there are more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Three members of the European Tour of the China Travel Service will board the ship in Singapore. Among the remaining 30, there is one each from Peiping and Nanking, three from Hong Kong, and twenty-five from Shanghai. The one from Peiping is the well-known Mr. Jiang Yong from the legal profession, who was elected as the leader of the tour. Their route is to visit Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Belgium, France, and Switzerland, and then return to China via Italy. After finishing his business, Mr. Jiang Yong must also go to Austria to attend the World Judicial Conference.</p>
<p>Everyone felt that during this 20-day sea voyage, they should organize and connect with each other. So they initiated the organization of the "World Games Same Boat Fellowship," and elected Mr. Jiang as the president. Nine staff members were elected. Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Dunli, and a reporter were elected on the side of the athlete delegation; lawyer Liu Zhen, doctor Wang Bichen, and Deng Bingquan, a staff member of the travel group, were elected on the side of the European tour; and the remaining three were Mr. Pan Huaguo, Deng Shuren, and Xue Lutan. After passing Singapore, the organizing committee will decide on the method of fellowship. Who says that we Chinese do not have the ability to organize?</p>
<p>High Spirits for Recreation</p>
<p>July 1st, the weather is clear, and the brilliance of the sun shines on the sea, reflecting golden ripples, which is truly beautiful. Everyone is very excited and active, no longer as depressed as yesterday.</p>
<p>Morning exercises were held for half an hour starting at 7:00 AM, and will be held on time every day thereafter. The recreation committee initiated a chess competition. The participants are Shu Hong, Leng Peigen, Lin Shaozhou, Wang Shoufang, Liu Changchun, Qian Yiqin, Song Junfu, Jiang Zhende, Wu Demao, Dai Shuguo, Zheng Huaixian, Peng Wenyu, Zhang Erding, and a reporter, a total of fourteen people. The competition uses an elimination system, and the opponents must play three games. A winning game gets two points, and a draw gets one point each. The first to get four points wins. The preliminary round was held this morning. It is scheduled to produce the champion on July 4th. Judging from the situation, the champion will probably be Wu Demao and Lin Shaozhou. After the chess competition is over, a Go championship will also be held. During the long journey, this kind of recreation increases everyone's interest.</p>
<p>In order to make everyone know a little German and reduce the language difficulties after arriving in Germany, the discussion committee started teaching German from today. German consultant Kurt, translator Mei Fuxiang, tour member Wu Zheng, and doctor Huang Yuankai, etc., taught in four classes. Each class had a dozen or so people participating.</p>
<p>In the entire group, more than ten people have been sick in the past two days. Some are because of improper diet, eating unaccustomed food that caused diarrhea. Some are because the room is hot, so they slept with the electric fan on and caught a cold. Doctor Huang Yuankai is extremely busy, but fortunately, none of them are serious. They are all better after taking some medicine.</p>
<p>The recreation committee has scheduled to hold the first recreation party tomorrow night. The venue is the music room in the first class cabin. All Chinese and Western passengers on the ship are invited to participate in addition to the delegation. The recreation program includes a formal singing of the Party song and a speech, as well as a chorus of all the female members, a speech by Wang Huaiqi and Jiang Zhende, a martial arts performance by the martial arts team, and a funny dance by Fu Baolu and Chen Baoqiu. At that time, there will definitely be many jokes.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (the 2nd) morning at 9:00 AM, we can arrive in Singapore. The journey of 1,451 nautical miles will soon come to an end. It is said that the overseas Chinese there will hold a welcome meeting. Everyone is preparing to participate and wants to visit.

<p>Hankou Navigation News: The Hubei Provincial Education College was established in October of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) when He Chengjun was in charge. It was established based on the resolutions of the Second National Education Conference and the urgent needs of the province. Although its organization belongs to the independent college within the university education system, its content is of a special nature. It is divided into two major systems: rural education and agricultural education, with a graduation period of four years. There are three specialized courses: rural normal school, public education, and agricultural education, with a graduation period of two years. If necessary, various special training classes are set up to create talents for rural construction, in order to achieve the goal of rural revitalization. Since its establishment, a total of 128 graduates from the specialized courses have been assigned to work in rural areas. Recently, the provincial government decided to discontinue the college and establish a training institute for township officials in order to actively improve rural construction.

<p>C. Funding: Each school should include school health funding in the budget. If necessary, a hygiene fee may be charged to students, but at most one dime per student per semester. Schools with fewer than 40 students should have an initial expense of 5 yuan and an annual recurring expense of 12 yuan.

<h3 id="e173">Yarn and Cotton Market: Multi-Party Manipulation Leads to Surge, Old Cotton Raises Two Yuan <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>—Rumors of Preparing for a Squeeze—</p>
<p>In the cotton market this morning, due to the surge in Indian cotton, the bulls took the opportunity to vigorously push up prices. Old cotton rose by more than six dimes. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the bulls had formed a considerable organization and were planning to squeeze old cotton. The market was filled with buying momentum, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. July and August futures jumped by more than one yuan. Although there was no certainty about this year's new cotton harvest, some bears continued to sell, but they were ultimately no match for the strong buying momentum, which also lifted prices by eight or nine dimes. Old cotton for this month broke through 48 yuan, and new cotton for three months all broke through the 44 yuan mark.</p>
<p>This Month Surpasses Eight Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened this morning. Although the rise in American cotton was stable, the situation was still firm. Supported by American cotton, Indian cotton surged by 4.25 to 10 rupees. In the spot cotton market, old cotton for July and August had insufficient gains yesterday, so the bulls engaged in pushing up prices, surging by six dimes to six dimes and five points. The situation in the second session remained firm, and the third closing was stable. However, because some traders were dumping new cotton, and the bulls were focusing on old cotton and did not show significant buying interest in new cotton, the market was relatively stable, rising only by five points to one dime. The second session in the afternoon saw rumors of bulls aggressively buying up old cotton in a squeeze. July and August jumped by one yuan, and new cotton was pulled up by two, four, and five to six dimes. In the third session, July continued to rise by one dime, and August rose slightly by one dime. New cotton rose slightly by one or two dimes. At the close, the momentum continued, with old cotton continuing to rise by two dimes and five points to four dimes and five points, and new cotton continuing to rise by two dimes and five points to four dimes. As a result, old cotton soared by 1.9 to 2 yuan compared to yesterday's close, and new cotton rose by seven to nine dimes. According to investigations, sellers included Jifeng (4,800 dan), Dafu (8,700 dan), Juxing (4,400 dan), Dafeng (3,000 dan), Yuanda (4,200 dan), Hexing (3,100 dan), Changji (2,900 dan), Shenchang (3,600 dan), Changyu (2,700 dan), Shenji (6,700 dan), Taichang (7,600 dan), Yichang (6,800 dan), Runkang (7,000 dan), and Xinchengchang (6,300 dan).

<p>Distant New Prices Reach 16.20 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Initially, the rise in American cotton had stabilized somewhat, and some bulls were cashing out. However, due to the insufficient gains in old cotton, the bulls took advantage of the continued rise in foreign cotton to vigorously push up prices. In the afternoon, rumors spread about the organization of new bull companies, which, in addition to buying in the market, would also absorb as much old bull positions as possible. The cotton market soared sharply, and the yarn market also jumped by about two yuan in the second and third sessions. The market situation was extremely tense, and all prices closed at the highest levels. Distant prices reached 216.20 yuan.</p>
<p>Bulls Absorb Spot Yarn as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning. Although the rise in American cotton had stabilized somewhat, and Indian cotton had surged by 4.25 to 10 rupees, it was also affected by American cotton. Therefore, the market was not very tense. Prices for each month rose and fell by three to five dimes. The second session became firm because the bulls vigorously pushed up the price of old cotton, rising by more than six dimes. The third closing also did not see much fluctuation. The market opened slightly firm in the afternoon. The second session became firm as the price of raw cotton for July and August surged, and the near-term became firm. Distant-term prices jumped by one yuan. In the third session, the buying sentiment was strong as the price of raw cotton surged very strongly, and prices continued to rise by one or two yuan. At the close, the near-term was flat, and the mid- and distant-term prices rose by about one yuan again. As a result, the price for this month rose by two yuan compared to yesterday's closing price, and the near- and distant-term prices rose by 2.6 to 3.7 yuan. According to investigations, sellers included Dafeng (1,000 bales), Yuanda (1,150 bales), Mingde (1,800 bales), Zhenda (1,100 bales), Changyu (1,950 bales), Renfeng (1,900 bales), Dachangcheng (1,850 bales), Taichang (2,500 bales), Yichang (2,350 bales), Changfeng (1,800 bales), and Runkang (2,400 bales).

<p>Sales Inevitably Somewhat Restricted</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good, but the rise in spot yarn prices has been very strong, and actual sales are inevitably somewhat restricted. A total of 743 bales were traded. Yarn prices rose by two yuan, and thread prices rose by four yuan. The purchase amounts for each area are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 374, Changsha: 20, Hankou: 5</p>
<p>Same Industry: 322, Ningbo: 7</p>
<p>Guangdong: 5, Wuhu: 10</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton and Yarn Both Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices rising and falling by two to three pounds. Initially, unfavorable news from Liverpool caused a reverse selling, with cotton farmers selling short, and the market sentiment was depressed. Subsequently, due to the need for July futures by traders, New Orleans bought in, short positions were covered, and the public bought again, and prices reached new highs for each month. There was no special news in the market. However, the government has withdrawn from the futures market. There is current demand activity, and there are limited sellers. Textile products are active and high. Due to the sharp rise in raw cotton, manufacturers withdrew their price lists. At the close, a large number of bulls settled and sold short, and the market trend was flat and weak. Spot prices rose by five pounds, and futures prices rose and fell by two to nine pounds. English cotton spot prices rose by 28 points, and futures prices rose by 34 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to bulls taking profits, but then firmed due to short covering and buying by Japanese companies and futures traders. Ultimately, it softened again due to manufacturers selling short and bulls taking profits. Pingguo Er rose by 4.25 to 5.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 6 to 8.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 9 to 10 rupees. Raw electricity recorded on the left (Dispatch of the 9th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening price of Bai Luoxi cotton for April and May on the 10th was at the top end, at 225 rupees, up half a rupee from the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Textile Goods: Prices of All Types of Cloth are Rising <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market gradually stabilized. Textile merchants offered Donghuo (local goods) unbleached cotton cloth, raising the price by one jiao per bolt compared to the previous batch. Dyeing factories slightly replenished their stock. Lower-grade fine cloth from local factories was also almost entirely purchased. Heavyweight coarse cloth generally increased by one jiao per bolt, while lightweight cotton cloth rose by five fen per bolt. Fine cloth and fine twill also increased by one or two jiao per bolt. Figured goods such as Luen Chang printed cloth and Keruo silk rose by five fen per bolt. Qiankun brand bleached cloth increased by one jiao and a half, selling for six yuan and eight jiao per bolt. After Yih Ho (a foreign company) further purchased over a hundred cases of both domestic and foreign-made Sijunzi serge, the market showed even more strength, rising another two and a half li. Large quantities of domestic goods were also sold, rising five li per yard. Only plain Suzhou silk maintained its previous sales price due to the approaching off-season, with spot goods selling well. Because the sales price rose, out-of-town merchants were unable to intervene. Shops on this street and in the interior were quiet, with few additional purchases. Yesterday, Yih Ho imported over thirty pieces of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and other goods. Other out-of-town merchants did not make large-scale purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Finance: Lack of Enthusiasm from Buyers, Declining Gold Speculation <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The amount of capital being gambled is also decreasing... Resulting in a further drop of one yuan and one jiao.</p>
<p>The gold market remained sluggish yesterday, with sellers still crowded. Due to a lack of buying power, it continued to fall by one yuan and one jiao. The situation in the market was uncertain, but the movement of spot goods was brisk. Initially, due to the imminent closure of customs, foreign telegrams reported that the price of large bars of silver was slightly higher for near-term contracts and unchanged for long-term contracts. The New York silver market remained inactive. Telegrams from Montreal indicated a slight increase in forward silver prices. Exchange rates slightly contracted. The price of raw gold in London rose by one penny. The Central Bank's posted exchange rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The customs gold unit rose by three li. The standard gold speculation price was posted at 1131 yuan, up from the previous day. Off-market preliminary trading opened at 35.5 to 36 yuan, but large firms such as Jude, Dafu, Taitai, Yongdingkang, and Dadecheng, along with individual investors, sold off, pushing the price down to within 35 yuan. Yicheng, Qingfa, and Yongna were relatively stable. The opening price was still low, and after opening, short sellers continued to liquidate their positions, causing prices to fall. Large investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, briefly driving prices up. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced its exchange rates, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also unchanged, leading to much fluctuation. Although there was some downward movement later, there was still support after the price fell. By noon, the overall trend turned flat. Later, the market gradually weakened, and large investors made small purchases, briefly improving the situation, but many took advantage of the opportunity to sell. Indian silver also rose by 4.4.3 anna. The market closed weak, with future speculation prices falling and spot prices rising. The current gold speculation price is one yuan lower than the August futures price. The market situation for today will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price this morning was 1135 yuan and one jiao, down five jiao compared to the close before customs closure.

Red gold is priced at 8 yuan more, at 1143 yuan and one jiao, because the spot market is firm and the speculation price is falling. Tianjin goods are priced at 15 yuan more, and smelted red gold is priced at 13 yuan more, but there are few sellers. 400 taels of smelted red gold was sold by Shengyuan Yong to silver shops at 16 yuan and seven jiao more. Because the current gold speculation price is lower than the August futures price, Shengyuan Yong transferred 7 bars to Yicheng at 1 yuan more.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was uncertain. Initially, the market fell due to gloomy news and high prices. Then, the market rose as individual investors covered their short positions. Overall, it was a situation of brewing change. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee was successfully opened as scheduled, which could be considered a positive sign. It may determine methods for receiving bonds, and the redemption may soon be cancelled. Smuggling in North China is rampant, and rumors are rampant, causing fluctuating market prices, showing the instability of sentiment. Yesterday's activity was as follows: The trend was weak in the two morning sessions, and it seemed that there were already flaws, judging from the emergence of Class A long positions. The two sessions have already fallen by 5-6 jiao. In the afternoon, the trend suddenly turned, with individual investors covering short positions and long positions also making slight gains. Market prices uniformly improved, rising by 0.15-0.45 yuan. There was sudden demand for serial number five issues at the closing, rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The trends in the morning and afternoon were completely different and not the actual market situation. As a result, the market prices generally recovered by 0.15-0.35 yuan. However, Class B bonds rose by 0.25-0.45 yuan. The total transaction volume was 83,150 yuan.

<h3 id="e179">Grains: Wheat Prices Become Increasingly Stronger, Futures Plunge in the Afternoon <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was initially strong in the morning session, but prices fell in the afternoon. At the start, the quotation for foreign wheat showed Chicago up 4-5 jiao and Canada up 3 jiao. Therefore, industry sentiment remained good, with near-term contracts up 2 fen and contracts from October onwards up 4-6 fen or more. However, the market plunged in the afternoon, due to the smooth arrival of spot goods and extremely strong demand in various outports. In addition, this year's new wheat market value is 40% higher than in previous years. This phenomenon is a rare sight in the last 3-5 years. Market sentiment considers domestic wheat to be speculative and hoarding, which affects the people's livelihood. Therefore, there are rumors of reducing the tax on foreign wheat, which caused great anxiety. Near-term contracts fell by 3-5 fen, and long-term contracts fell by 0.7-1.2 jiao. In short, price fluctuations are common after outside speculators intervene. The current wheat market remains stable due to manufacturers holding their positions. The opening price for Huai'an wheat was 4.44 yuan for top quality and 4.42 yuan for second quality. Nanjing wheat was 4.432 yuan for top quality and 4.3 yuan for second quality. Yangzhou wheat was 4.424 yuan for top quality and 4.2 yuan for second quality. Gaoyou wheat was 4.442 yuan. Puzhen wheat was 4.432 yuan. Hankou wheat was 4.423 yuan for top quality and 4.2 yuan for second quality. Wagon wheat was 4.439 yuan. Qingjiangpu Jiangbei wheat was 4.441 yuan. Chongming wheat was 3.85 yuan. Fuxin purchased 10,000 bags, and Fufeng Shenda purchased 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat forecasts increased rainfall, and it is hoped that crops will be able to recover, but there is no concern about an excessive supply. After the reaction, prices may stabilize again. On July 1, the condition of Canadian wheat was 82% of normal, compared to 95% last year. Crops continued to suffer damage after July 1.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Flour Still Traded at Price Limits <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market still opened in the morning and afternoon sessions. However, the market for all months was still traded under price limits. The general opinion is that the market has been restricted by the price limit, and both buyers and sellers feel inconvenience. Therefore, most people hope to abolish the price limit and establish a new method that is more appropriate. However, if outside long positions can be at peace, there will be fewer problems in the future. Because the production is limited, and the buying power from outsiders is endless, it is too dangerous. Therefore, we asked the exchange, which believes it is temporary.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Rice Sales Increasingly Sluggish <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's total arrivals from various sources were only from warehouses 17 and 18, totaling 3,600-3,700 shi. However, retail sales are even more sluggish, making it difficult for Houzao (thick early)粳 (japonica) rice to maintain its position. The market continued to depreciate by a few fen to one jiao. Although Da Lian, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei shipped over 1,400 packages of Bo Dao (thin japonica) rice bags, they were all of high-quality materials. As a result, while high-quality goods were able to hold their ground, medium-quality goods ultimately could not maintain their position, and prices fell again by nearly one chi. Guiyang Jian (pointed rice) has not yet been opened for sale, and Bian Yuan (variable rice) is also softening.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various routes in Hexia were from warehouses 14 and 15. Sales of various goods on the market remained unusually sluggish. However, Bian Yuan (variable rice) continued to be sold off. There were few arrivals of Gao Bai (high white) 粳 (japonica) rice, and the market price of white 粳 (japonica) rice was reduced by another 1-2 jiao. Bai Yuan (white round rice) remained firm, and Bo Dao (thin japonica) rice slightly thinned by a few fen. The prices of various Jian (pointed rice) and other goods were also reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e182">After Price Cuts, the Sales of Kexian Rice Are Still Difficult <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals remained active, with continuous shipments from Jiangxi, Hunan, and other ports to Shanghai. Stockpilers were also eager to sell off their stored rice, but unfortunately, the buying appetite on this street suddenly became dull. After price cuts, sales were still difficult, with high, medium, and low grades all continuously falling by 1-2 jiao. Special high-quality goods were not opened for sale due to price adjustments. Mid and low-grade Jiangxi rice still had domestic sales, and Tianjin dealers bought more than 300 packages of high-quality Xiang rice, but the sales were very few. It will be difficult to turn the market around in the future. A total of 1,952 packages of Jiangxi rice and 377 packages of Xiang rice were opened for sale in the city.</p>

<p>Wutun Zhenmei Tea Sells Well After Price Decrease</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market was very active, with a total of over 8,700 boxes of red and green tea traded throughout the city. Qimen floral-scented black tea was heavily purchased by Jardine Matheson and Russian dealers, making it the most popular in the market. Zhenmei tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi was actively traded, but the selling price slightly decreased. Jinlong purchased over 400 boxes of Tunzhen tea, priced at 81-82 yuan. Baolong purchased nearly 500 boxes of She Dong Zhenmei tea, priced at 75 yuan. Xiehe also traded over 200 boxes of low-grade Wuyuan Zhenmei tea, priced at 73 yuan. Scattered transactions of various grades of Chouxin Zhenmei tea continued. Ping Shui tea continued to be traded by large dealers. Jinlong Tianranmei tea was priced at 41 yuan. There were also considerable discussions about small boxes and large dealers. Jinlong also purchased about 500 boxes of miscellaneous pearl tea, priced at 56.5 yuan. The market price was still able to hold its ground. American dealers were becoming more active in other needle-shaped eyebrow tea and pearl tea, and the market was very stable.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Sugar Market: Guangdong Sugar Futures Transactions are Very Active <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Price Increase of Two Jiao is Expected Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a consistent upward trend due to tight customs duties and gradually increasing sales. The association's base price for Grade 24 coarse sand white, as well as Dongbai (eastern white) and this factory's Mianbai (cotton white) sugar, remained unchanged. Trading houses opened at 14.3 yuan for 37 packages of Gao Mian Chi (high cotton red) sugar from the Guangdong Chaozhou area, and Yu Fengheng, Fangcuihe opened at 12.2 yuan for 200+ packages of Nan Chi (southern red) sugar, up 0.2 yuan. Other trading houses opened at 18 yuan for 100+ packages of Zhao'an White sugar. The product's texture was relatively coarse, but the color was white and fragrant, so it opened for trade at 18 yuan. On the foreign company side, Da Chang sold 200 tons of August delivery Dutch coarse white sugar at 3.025 yuan. It was reported that Xianhui rose again to 114 yuan. The production price of Qing Chi (green red) sugar remains tight, and 1502 packages of Hainan Red sugar arrived yesterday via Jiaying ship.</p>
<p>Because of the news that the price would increase by 0.2 yuan next week, yesterday's combined company for the third futures transaction of the week, with a total fixed amount of over 10,000 packages of Guangdong coarse white and cotton white sugar, saw a very active transaction. The Shunde factory sold 11,522 packages of Wuyang (five-sheep brand) coarse white sugar at 21.6 yuan. The City New Factory sold 1,684 packages at the same price. The Dongguan factory sold 5,600 packages at 21.5 yuan. The Quxi factory sold 610 packages at 21.3 yuan. Number 2 cotton white sugar sold 5,124 packages at 20.6 yuan. Number 4 sold 2,581 packages at 20.4 yuan. Medium sand white sugar sold 20 packages at 19.1 yuan. In total, 27,141 packages were transacted.</p>

<p>After the first batch of new Xuzhou vegetables entered the market, it was learned yesterday that Xin Zhongxing vegetables produced in Huaibei will also be shipped to Shanghai next Monday. The initial price is expected to be similar to that of Xuzhou goods. According to a message from Hankou, the first batch of Zhengzhou vegetables was directly purchased by Hong Kong dealers at 26 yuan, priced at 13 yuan. According to letters, this year's harvests in various producing areas are estimated to be 70-80%. Considering the current situation, there may be a reduction in purchasing power, so those engaged in this business must be wary.</p>

<p>East White Iron prices rose repeatedly due to factory shipments being insufficient for sales, with 3-foot 7-inch sheets selling for 1.02 yuan each, an increase of 0.03 yuan from the previous price, and 3-foot 6-inch sheets selling for 0.82 yuan each, an increase of 0.02 yuan from the previous price. Over the past two days, the market price has fallen again due to increased factory shipments and a sudden shift to sluggish real sales. 3-foot 7-inch sheets are selling for 1 yuan each, and large transactions and cash purchases can still be lowered to 0.99 yuan per sheet. 3-foot 6-inch sheets are selling for 0.8 yuan each. Transactions are most active on this street. Business from out-of-town dealers cannot be loaded because the factory has not yet paid export taxes. The market for other thick white iron has not changed much in price due to limited imports and exports.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Summer Vacation Labor and Women <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Danxing</p>
<p>The long summer vacation of more than two months has now begun. Whether on the streets, at the docks, or at the train stations, there are traces of female students, happily carrying luggage and books, embarking on their journeys and returning to their hometowns. After half a year of studying, living a rigid and boring school life, one cannot help but feel weary. Everyone now holds the idea of spending a comfortable summer. At home, there is no restriction of classes, and they do not have to worry about all the trivial matters themselves. These women think that as modern, educated, new women, they disdain to do those trivial housework. Besides reading and attending classes, it's all about "enjoying life."</p>
<p>This thinking is widespread, so the mistake is also widespread. I believe the meaning of summer vacation is not at all to call the students—including the female students—to go home to—"escape the heat" or "enjoy life," but precisely to provide a suitable opportunity to experience life education in practice, away from the somewhat empty and abstract book education. From practicing small household chores to helping directly or indirectly with sanitation work and reforming living habits in rural towns and villages. Currently, many so-called new-style women often look down on the work that mothers or maids do, and even more so on the simple forms in their hometowns, and think they inherently belong to the city. To manage matters in rural towns and villages is considered extremely boring. What is especially strange is that some new-style women themselves think that they are unwilling to do these things, but they hope that others will do them, while they themselves lie on rattan chairs and comment. They have not thought about whether they will be subject to even harsher comments!</p>
<p>"Why do you want to study?" Everyone will answer this question quickly, either to be the main force in the women's movement, or to be a female politician, or to be determined to serve society. No one would say: After I study, I plan to be a parasite, a freeloader in society. Aspirations are certainly great, and ambitions are certainly extraordinary, but how should we begin to lead the masses, serve society, and work for the country? Do we need to have some practice beforehand? I think; from trivial to great undertakings, from local to the whole society, that is the inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Female students who have returned home for the summer vacation, do not waste this opportunity! Know that stealing time to enjoy life requires no practice. The labor you do now is the foundation for your future ambition to put into practice.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Marriage Age of British Women <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>The period of youth is the period of love, which can be said to be known to all, but in present-day England, the period of love is no longer the period requiring marriage, and it has become a country where late marriages are prevalent. According to the statistical reports of the census, in 1871, the marriage rate of every thousand 20-year-old women was 133.7. In 1921 it was 114.4; in 1931 it was 106.5. In 1871, the marriage rate of every thousand women between the ages of 25 and 30 was 85.9, in 1921 it was 100, and in 1931 it was 96.9. The statistics for men are as follows: In 1871, the marriage rate of every thousand 20-year-old men was 122.4, in 1921 it was 94.4; in 1931 it was 72.5. The marriage rate of men between the ages of 25 and 30 was: In 1871 it was 119.3, in 1921 it was 161.1, and in 1931 it was 140.8. One point to note here is that in 1871, the remarriage rate of every thousand 20-year-old widows was 170.5, which was higher than the marriage rate of women of the same age. In 1871, the remarriage rate of every thousand 20-year-old widowers was 229.0, which was a rapid increase compared to the marriage rate of the same age.</p>
<p>If you want to notice the changes between now and the Victorian era, just look at the British royal family. Queen Victoria was married before the age of twenty-one, and the prince she married was not older than she was. Her great-grandson, the Duke of Gloucester (referring to the younger brother of the English new Emperor Edward VIII, who married in early November of last year), did not marry until he was thirty-five, and the Duchess was also thirty-four years old. In the Victorian era, an unmarried woman at the age of twenty-five was already considered old; by the age of twenty-eight, she was an old maid. A man aged thirty-five or forty would look for a wife among girls aged eighteen to twenty-one, and a man of this age would likely be taking a second wife. Now, husbands and wives can be called friends and travel companions, and sometimes they can be called co-workers. Whether living in a palace or a cottage, husband and wife are partners in life. Late marriage can help to create an ideal union and find an ideal partner. This is one of the results of changing social conditions, undoubtedly created for personal happiness. But scientists and politicians are very concerned about this situation. They believe that this is one of the important reasons for the decline in the birth rate.</p>
<p>In 1881, the population of England and Wales was 26 million, and there were 900,000 births. In 1931, the population was 40 million, but there were only 630,000 births. Sir Arnold Wilson told the British Association: "The time when our population is static will not be long, perhaps it will decrease, and the late marriage of women is one of the direct reasons. Poverty is not a factor in the decline in the birth rate. The standard of living that married men and women desire is a big factor. When people carefully choose a car or a stroller, they always choose a car, which implies the desire to reduce the number of children." In short, people now have to think carefully before getting married. Cottage romance is not as common as it used to be, unless the cottage has a good gas stove, electric broom, electric iron, and labor-saving equipment in the kitchen. It is not to say that there is no longer any spiritual love, and everything must be based on material enjoyment. The reality is that people are more knowledgeable and have a wider range of knowledge. Therefore, marriage often has to wait until around the age of thirty. Now that the standard of living and enjoyment has increased, the concept of age is very different from before, and no one would think that a thirty-year-old woman is old. Moreover, women are no longer slaves. They have freedom, and they have greater opportunities to find careers to support themselves. We should not only not oppose late marriage, but also help them meet all their needs and create an independent spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Marriage, Hygiene, and Health <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>When discussing women's issues today, everyone immediately brings up sexual liberation, freedom of occupation, equality of life, and so on, while few people pay attention to issues such as hygiene and health in marriage. This is truly a very unfortunate phenomenon. Recently, the health authorities of a certain city announced that during physical examinations of newly admitted female students at a girls' school, it was discovered that some had congenital syphilis, and some had directly contracted syphilis. Most of the female students nowadays come from families above the poverty line and have a certain level of knowledge. Yet, they still suffer from congenital or acquired syphilis. It is not difficult to imagine how rampant this bacteria is. Therefore, I feel that in this age when women have already won freedom of marriage, it is essential to not neglect the health and hygiene of the prospective spouse before getting married.</p>
<p>In order to prohibit marriages between Germans and Jews, Germany issued several regulations regarding marriage. However, these regulations, in practice, are not only about prohibiting German-Jewish marriages. Some of the rules also apply to marriages between Germans, For example, if one or both parties are not physically healthy, such as suffering from syphilis, lung disease, or other illnesses, and cannot provide a health certificate from a doctor, they are prohibited from marrying. This is something extremely worthy of consideration because children born to parents with serious illnesses naturally cannot become healthy citizens. The German nation is known for its excellence, so they are greatly concerned about producing unhealthy citizens. China is a weak country. If we continue to follow this path, allowing men and women with syphilis or lung disease to marry, what kind of face will the Chinese nation have in the future?</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, I feel that before marriage, both parties should ask a doctor to examine them and prove that they have no syphilis, no lung disease, or other serious illnesses. If one party is found to have a serious illness, the marriage should be postponed or even canceled to avoid infection and lifelong regret. If, in fact, due to intense love, they cannot bring themselves to take decisive action, then I believe it is necessary to strictly implement birth control to prevent the children born from being innocently plunged into unfortunate fates. This benefits both the nation and the family. Group weddings are popular in various cities now. I think it would be possible to stipulate clearly that all those applying to join a group wedding must submit a doctor's certificate proving that they have no diseases that could affect the health and hygiene of their partners before they are allowed to join. This may seem like a harsh rule now, but besides this method, who can set an example and promote it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, most ordinary women nowadays lack sufficient knowledge about venereal diseases. Often, wives whose husbands are infected do not even realize it. By the time they are infected by their husbands, although they feel pain, they are ashamed to seek help, leading to unimaginable consequences. This is extremely common. In such cases, I urge women to have some knowledge of venereal diseases to monitor their husbands' health and hygiene, and to protect themselves. If they are infected by their husbands, they must not let it spread. They must seek medical treatment as soon as possible to avoid producing children with congenital diseases, and then regret it.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Women of New Fuzhou in Nanyang <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Junyi</p>
<p>New Fuzhou is far away in the southern islands, south of the Chinese South Sea, on the northern coast of Borneo. Thirty years ago, it was nothing more than barren and remote land. After the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, overseas Chinese began to cultivate there. These people were all Fujian compatriots who accidentally found this barren land while seeking a place to live overseas. Because the scenery was pleasant, the weather was warm, and the land was fertile, they settled there, intending to reside there permanently. Later, because eight or nine out of ten were from Fuzhou, the place was named New Fuzhou. The entire region has no more than 30,000 residents, and the number of women is less than one-third of the number of men. They are in an unequal position to men. The strong and middle-aged are diligent in their work, but the elderly and young women are very few.</p>
<p>Apart from the elderly and young women working at home, eight out of ten middle-aged women work in rubber plantations, because the area is planted with rubber trees, which are very lush. The local overseas Chinese all depend on this for their livelihoods. They definitely have the ability to be economically self-sufficient, and they have more than enough. Therefore, their assistance to the family's livelihood is not shallow, which is an advantage that women in the country do not have.</p>
<p>They work about ten hours a day, all toiling under the scorching sun. The work process is as follows: first, use a knife to cut the rubber tree bark. Then, use a cup to collect the flowing rubber. Pour the rubber from each cup into a bucket, and then transport the rubber from the bucket to another place, where it is mixed with chemicals to solidify it. Then, use a machine to roll it into sheets of rubber, and then wash it. That is the end of a day's work. Then, they can go to the river in groups, happily bathe, and prepare dinner.</p>
<p>They continue like this day after day, unless there is a heavy rain in the evening or morning. Otherwise, there is no chance to rest. However, there are also a small number who are devout Christians and must strictly observe the Sabbath. Therefore, they can rest on Sundays, but they have to sit motionlessly in the church for more than ten hours, which is not as free and relaxed as working in the rubber plantation!</p>
<p>As for how much they earn for such hard work, in the past, when the cost of living was low, each woman could earn about 30 to 40 yuan a month. However, the current situation is very different. The reason is that the price of rubber has fallen sharply, and everyone is rushing to do this business. It is difficult to even maintain their daily lives. If there are illnesses or unfortunate events like weddings or funerals, there is no money to spend.</p>
<p>"Three meals a day, just seeking to fill the stomach" is their saying about food, because there is no delicious food to buy there. As for what they wear, most of it is made of coarse cloth. Women inherently have a love for beauty, but they do not like to dress up and have no extravagant habits. This aspect is admirable!</p>
<p>Their marriage issues are enforced by their parents. The children dare not resist at all, and the goal of marriage is based on money and social status. Whoever can pay a large bride price can take the woman as their own. The author has lived there for ten years, and has heard and seen that not a single woman has not been engaged under this buying-and-selling marriage system. As for the reasons, there are several: Because there are more men than women, there are not enough to distribute. Because most of the men who are engaged are over 30 years old. Women can work and reduce the burden on men. Women have not received adequate education and lack knowledge. There is no reason to resist. Therefore, if education can be popularized soon, this autocratic marriage system may gradually be eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Food Preparation for Artificial Feeding of Infants <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuxiu</p>
<p>Many infants cannot get breast milk because their mothers have various illnesses. These infants often suffer because the food preparation for artificial feeding is improper, or because of poor hygiene. There are often infants who are fat and white, but cannot be cured once they get sick. As a result, the medical community has recently discovered that the mortality rate of artificially fed infants is different from that of breastfed infants. I am now introducing a more scientific food preparation method to mothers who cannot breastfeed due to these reasons, for reference.</p>
<p>As for the benefits of breast milk, such as suitable temperature, the natural immunity in the milk that enables the infant to also acquire natural immunity, and that breast milk provides everything the infant needs, etc., I have explained in detail in another article.</p>
<p>Preparation of Breast Milk Substitute</p>
<p>Using cow's milk as a substitute for breast milk has the following drawbacks: It does not have the elements to prevent diseases. The temperature during feeding is also not easy to control. Cow's milk is the natural food for calves, and of course, it has many unsuitable aspects for the human body (such as the protein in cow's milk being difficult to digest). The comparison between cow's milk and human milk is listed below:</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, we can see that there are many differences in the composition of cow's milk and human milk. Therefore, when we use artificial feeding, we must make it closer to human milk before it can be used. There is now a newly invented method, which is to use lactic acid to pre-digest part of the protein in cow's milk, add water to dilute the cow's milk, and then add sugar to prevent the sugar content in the milk from being insufficient. The method is as follows: Prepare a white porcelain measuring cup, a glass dropper, a bottle of lactic acid, and a glass rod or bamboo chopsticks. All of the above equipment must be completely disinfected. After boiling the cow's milk that has been bought, put it in the refrigerator, or cool it with water (by placing the cow's milk pot in a basin filled with cold water). According to the following dosage, use a glass dropper to absorb lactic acid, stir the cow's milk with one hand, and slowly drip in the lactic acid with the other hand. If you see the cow's milk curdling, stop dripping the lactic acid immediately. After it is done, put it back in the refrigerator. When you want to use it, warm it with hot water before feeding. The dosage is configured as follows: (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e192">Discussion on Establishing a Correspondence School for Housewives <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>The subjects taught in general schools are mostly Chinese language, foreign languages, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, geography, and so on. Specialized schools specialize even more in various specialized subjects. This kind of education is obviously not suitable for women in our country, who make up the absolute majority and whose way out is marriage. Although some girls' schools also have courses such as sewing and cooking, these useful courses do not receive as much attention as other general courses, which is also an obvious fact. This situation may be similar in the United States, so not long ago, there was the creation of "bride schools" to train women who are about to become brides with some common sense in handling household affairs. The organization and curriculum of these bride schools cannot be fully understood, so it is impossible to study them here. However, I always feel that handling household affairs is a complex matter, and it cannot be successfully trained through classroom education lasting only a few months or weeks. Moreover, there are many ways to manage a home that cannot be understood and appreciated simply by reading notes and writing notes. For the sake of practicality, I feel that it is necessary to create a "Correspondence School for Housewives."</p>
<p>The Correspondence School for Housewives can be divided into several groups, such as "Sewing," "Cooking," "Infant Care," "Husband Management," "Servant Management," "Family Hygiene," "Socializing," "Birth Control," "Family Reading Materials," etc. Several groups do not need to be concentrated in one place. For example, the "Sewing Group" can be entrusted to a clothing company. The "Infant Care Group" can be handled by a childcare organization. The "Family Reading Materials Group" can be jointly managed by a bookstore or newsstand. The work of each group can be entrusted to a specialized organization. The so-called correspondence school does not need any grand equipment or a large number of clerks and secretaries. The responsibility of the school is only to contact reliable branch offices and guide correspondents to the appropriate place to inquire and forward various correspondence letters. If the work develops, it can naturally compile correspondence publications, publicly publish some valuable questions and answers from a certain period, and distribute or sell them to housewives in each family. In a considerable period of time, it can also create correspondence statistics for each group and study the needs, development, and improvement of that curriculum.</p>
<p>If this kind of correspondence school is really established, I think that new housewives or mothers with newborn children in each family will feel extremely happy and convenient. If there are occasional household management problems that are difficult to solve, they only need to write a letter to the correspondence school, and the correspondence school will forward it to a certain group, or write directly to a certain group to inquire, or call a certain group to inquire directly, and they can get answers and guidance. This is naturally much better than asking neighbors for advice and getting irresponsible or unreasonable guidance, or gaining experience through failure. Therefore, I feel that the establishment of this kind of correspondence school is extremely worthy of discussion at present. There is no shortage of enthusiastic men and women in Shanghai who care about the happiness of women! I think this may be realized in the near future and benefit housewives who have no home management experience.</p>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e193">Interview with Ms. Dai Yi, Wife of Wu Yun Chu <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Devoted to factory affairs, diligent and hardworking all year round, disregarding personal enjoyment; Providing relief to the poor, nurturing students, all for the benefit of society!</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspapers reported that the International Labor Olympic Games awarded a first-class prize to Mr. Wu Yun Chu of our country. This is a very honorable thing. Mr. Wu is a leader in the domestic chemical industry. It is not known how much effort he has put in to earn this medal, which is much more valuable than our domestic first-class Caiyu Medal. Moreover, he represents the Chinese people in winning international honor, which means that he is gaining face for everyone, so it is worth congratulating. I remember Mr. Zhang Boling once said that China has two chemical industrialists, namely "Wu in the South and Fan in the North." Wu in the South is Mr. Wu Yun Chu, and Fan in the North is Mr. Fan Xudong. The enterprises created by Fan have a strong influence in North China. Wu personally created Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate, Tianli Nitrous Gas, Tianyuan Electrochemistry, and Tiansheng Ceramics in Shanghai. These four factories are the crystallization of his efforts and are also national industries related to national defense. Mr. Wu is not only meticulous in his career, but also diligent in learning and health. He is honest and respectful in his conduct and is a model for the public. What kind of person is his wife, Ms. Dai Yi? Perhaps few people outside know. Well, let me tell you, she is a worker who combines knowledge and action and is also worthy of being called a model for women. The following is a quick sketch of my interview.</p>
<p>When I walked into the Tianchu General Management Office, I saw the staff extremely busy. On one side, there were three female employees talking to male and female workers. Mr. Wu invited me into the reception room. I explained my purpose, first asking about his residence. He pointed to the fourth floor of the factory building. Then I asked about his wife, and he quickly went to the next room to ask her to come over. He said with a smile, "I don't have a mansion. That room is our bedroom. She works in the factory all year round." It turned out that one of the female employees I saw was Mrs. Wu, who is the factory affairs director of Tianchu. She has been working on time every day since its establishment in May 1923, without ever being absent. She is in charge of worker management, product review, and work allocation. She said, "Now there are more people in the factory, and with the division of labor and cooperation, things are easier to handle. In the early days, we both took on everything, big and small." Ah! This wife is truly remarkable. She wears homespun clothes, does not use any makeup, and is strong and full of energy. "Madam, who has been in charge of the household affairs for more than ten years while you have been working hard in the factory?" I asked her this question first. "My family is extremely simple. That bedroom has nothing but beds, chairs, tables, and benches. We both work and eat in the factory all day long, and only go there to rest at night. We hire an old nanny to take care of me. She has been hired for more than 20 years. I only have one son, who graduated from Shanghai University this summer and will soon go to the United States to study. Without the burden of children, I can fulfill my abilities. To be honest, I am not good at socializing. In addition to work, I have seventy or eighty female work companions. They are meticulous in their work and go to the club in their spare time to play various games. The factory treats them very well, and they are also very content. We are close to each other, like a family. Among them, there are many young girls who are ambitious. They studied at the literacy school for two months and are still determined to learn. I took it upon myself to guide them in subjects such as Chinese language, mathematics, and common sense. I answer all questions. I feel that all industrial and commercial organizations, if they can be united from top to bottom and treat each other with sincerity, will never have unexpected disputes. After all, people have sympathy. Do you think that's right?" This is a very moving passage from Mrs. Wu.</p>
<p>"What is your attitude towards social welfare undertakings?" "Because factory affairs are more complicated, I don't often hear about external matters. In recent years, I have joined the Shanghai Women's Progressive Association, and I am honored to serve as a member of the standing committee. Whenever there are women who have unhappy families and get divorced and have nowhere to go, I maintain their lives. Every year, I use my own funds to nurture poor children, and there are more than a dozen of them. Five years ago, Mr. Wu established the Qinghan Education Fund Association, and I was the first to agree. Every year, we recruit twelve people and send them to domestic universities, providing them with all expenses. Two classes have already graduated. We provide them with all expenses, each requiring seven or eight hundred gold per year. In five years, we have spent six or seven thousand yuan. They are very able to endure hardship and are very promising in the future. Last year, Mr. Wu proposed to purchase two Tianchu airplanes and donate them to the government. He initially sought my consent. I said that the country is in trouble, everyone should have the heart to save the country, and this move is enough to call on the people to build national defense. I extremely agree." Mrs. Wu also talked about her usual attitude towards Mr. Wu, and she said it very pertinently. She said, "People who serve the society inevitably encounter unsatisfactory things. Someone like him, who is always harmonious, sometimes gets stimulated. I am a woman, and I have no long-term strategy other than to use words to comfort him. Everything can be done by one's own efforts, and everything can be overcome. Mr. Wu has one advantage: he only works hard for his career and does not care about the trivial matters at home. Even when he goes out on a long trip, I advise him not to worry about anything, anyway, household affairs are easy to handle. We only have one day off a week, and we usually have very little entertainment. Only during the New Year holidays do we have the opportunity to travel and enjoy a few days of leisurely happiness."</p>
<p>I feel that what they have done is truly for the welfare of the people and to restore the vitality of the society and the country. This kind of great spirit is worthy of being imitated by everyone. Nowadays, human desires are rampant and social customs are declining. Therefore, I do not hesitate to use words to introduce outstanding people, just to persuade everyone to be good people and do good deeds. If I overpraise others, then I am afraid that I will be subverting right and wrong!</p>

<p>Mr. Bin Kun:</p>
<p>It is indeed a "very common and frequently seen fact" that young people set foot in the world of women and like to spend their precious time in the atmosphere of romance, as your letter says. Moreover, there are many young men with erotic mania who disregard everything and are willing to sacrifice their lifelong reputation and limited energy to exchange for worthless carnal desires. Therefore, to revitalize the social atmosphere of lewdness, the first key is to correct the psychology of social youth, otherwise it will forever be a dream!</p>
<p>Now that things have come to this point, you should quickly "rein in the horse on the edge of the cliff and start anew." Otherwise, the darkness of the future can be determined. However, the first important thing is to cure your body first. You said in your letter, "I contracted gonorrhea by setting foot in the world of women, and I also suffer from severe neurasthenia, and I also reported to me in great detail the process of treating you at that time." Only one point: I also regretted for you that you carelessly and mistakenly took cheap and inferior medicines advertised as so-called non-specific old therapies, which led to you being trapped in pain for a long time and unable to extricate yourself. Not only did it exhaust your money, but also the symptoms tended to become chronic. Your misfortune was caused by society, by cunning counterfeit merchants, and ultimately, you lacked the common sense to distinguish, which is also one of the reasons that added to your pain.</p>
<p>Your complaints, your anger, your deep hatred for inferior medicines, these are the experiences you have gained from your own experience, and I express my deep sympathy to you. Because of the complexity of society and the treachery of people's hearts, they actually do not hesitate to use the four words "ultimate success" to deceive patients! No wonder you fell into the trap.</p>
<p>Now that you have taken "Anti-Gonorrhea" under the guidance of friends with medical knowledge and the disease has suddenly improved, and you also mentioned in your letter, "I am grateful to your doctor for the responsible and detailed diagnosis, which is also the reason for shortening the course of the disease." This is the duty that everyone engaged in medicine should do, and there is nothing surprising about it. You should know: although your gonorrhea is said to be "no longer worried," but you feel tinnitus, headache, and insomnia, which is enough to prove that your neurasthenia has not yet healed, so the most important thing is not to relapse, and at the same time, quickly buy and take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadotropin" to supplement your lost energy, which is more reliable, what do you think? I wish you a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Wu Dachao</p>

<h3 id="e195">Home Self-Treatment for Women's Diseases <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Diseases suffered by women in general, such as irregular menstruation, persistent leukorrhea, and ulcers on the cervix, are all called women's diseases.</p>
<p>If a young girl has had self-indulgent behavior, then her body will naturally be weak. As a result of physical weakness, irregular menstruation also follows. In addition, the most troublesome and underestimated serious disease for women is leukorrhea. Not to mention married women, even unmarried virgins also suffer from this disease. Originally, the so-called leukorrhea is caused by the flow of secretions from the vagina, soaking the vulva and its vicinity. When it is severe, the flow is particularly large, and even a hidden stinging pain is felt when urinating. Leukorrhea is divided into physiological and pathological types. Physiological leukorrhea is not felt by oneself, and when one has already felt it, it shows that the secretion is progressing and has become a disease.</p>
<p>There are various different causes of leukorrhea, not only due to various abnormalities or diseases of the reproductive organs, but also due to diseases of the cervix and vagina (mainly gonorrhea). Other reasons, such as congestion of the reproductive organs and increased secretions, are also quite common.</p>
<p>When a woman suffers from this disease, her pain is no different from that of a prisoner in jail. If a pregnant woman suffers from gonorrheal leukorrhea, if the leukorrhea is not treated first, then the safety of the fetus will become a problem. The fetus's eyes are at great risk of blindness because they have to pass through the mother's vagina during birth, and the mother's risk may also increase. Because leukorrhea results in physical weakness and the development of various diseases, can you imagine if it is safe to give birth safely? In the Chinese women's community, they think it is shameful to be examined by a gynecologist, and they hesitate to undergo an examination. Open examinations are not welcome. Therefore, knowledge of home self-treatment is what most women urgently want to know and discuss. However, irregular menstruation caused by physical illnesses can be cured by taking only one type of "Gonadotropin" for women made with gonadal hormones. Other women suffering from leukorrhea should first know the cause of the disease. If it is gonorrheal, then they must first take "Anti-Gonorrhea" and then use "Cure Leukorrhea Elixir" to cure it in the short term. "Cure Leukorrhea Elixir" not only quickly stops leukorrhea, but also cures cervicitis, vaginal itching, and erosion suffered by women. Female youths suffering from women's diseases should not forget the above three types of home self-treatment.</p>

<p>— Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Regardless of the cause of your bone and muscle aches, you should quickly take Strongston's "Bone Pain Tablets." No introduction is needed, as discerning patients have long praised them. It can truly be said that they are "universally acclaimed" and "reach everywhere." Whether you have joint pain, bone spurs, or even limb stiffness, kidney pain, arthritis, or even hemiplegia, relief can be achieved within fifty tablets. Because each bottle of "Bone Pain Tablets" contains fifty tablets, it truly has the miraculous effect of rejuvenation. Those with a risk of cerebral congestion should especially take preventive measures early, as cerebral congestion is purely due to arteriosclerosis. Only these Bone Pain Tablets can prevent arteriosclerosis. Friends with uremia also have no other means of recovery except this. Therefore, the efficacy of Strongston's "Bone Pain Tablets" will certainly not be forgotten by patients. I think that there are particularly many Chinese people suffering from bone pain, and they need such sincere guidance, and many people are eagerly awaiting it.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Remedy for Premature Aging <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Speaking of it makes us afraid. One of the most painful ailments a person can have is when a young person, before reaching middle age, is already mentally exhausted and lifeless. Truly, at the prime of life, they are already close to death. How painful is this? Analyzing the formation of such a constitution, it is undoubtedly due to a lack of knowledge of health preservation in ordinary times. However, there are also those who show weakness due to congenital deficiencies, and this cannot be generalized. But regardless of whether it is congenital or acquired, in short, one should be prepared for a rainy day. In my opinion, the strength of the human body depends entirely on the vigorous metabolic capacity of all parts of the body. The most important thing that governs metabolism is the abundance of blood. After the blood is sufficient, it can thrive, and diseases will not arise. But for people who are weak and plagued by diseases, their bodies must lack the main component of blood. When the blood is depleted, how can semen be produced? Even for those with congenital deficiencies, there are those with the same congenital deficiencies, one who is strong due to proper nourishment and the other who suffers countless pains because they do not know how to preserve their health and seek remedies. I think readers will not deny this situation! Among medicines, the most nourishing and effective are those made from gonadal hormones, "Gonadin," which deserves praise. The rest are mediocre and cannot be called effective. Men and women suffering from premature aging and multiple diseases should quickly choose your path to survival! Try taking a bottle, and you will feel the effect.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Infectious Venereal Disease, Namely Syphilis (Continuation 5) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>"Gonorrhea"</p>
<p>However, seeking a doctor at this time is already too late. If the patient can receive proper treatment within one or two days of contracting the disease, the developing gonorrhea can be quickly treated with an abortive method. When the symptoms have already become severe, even if a doctor is immediately consulted, and the doctor consulted is extremely competent, then the most intense period of suffering will still be prolonged to more than a week. After that, if the treatment progresses well, the pain gradually decreases, the secretions gradually decrease and become thinner, changing from a yellow-green pus-like substance to a gray-white mucus, and the swelling and redness of the urethral opening and foreskin also gradually subside. It usually takes about six weeks to heal. However, such a good course is often not encountered.</p>
<p>Many—and indeed most—people with gonorrhea, when their gonorrhea is about to fully heal, relapse suddenly because they do not know how to care for themselves, or because of drinking, or sexual activity, or strenuous exercise, or because of excessive nocturnal emission, or because of the doctor's injection of strong drugs, or because the gonorrhea itself naturally spreads from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra. Therefore, in the early stages of gonorrhea infection, if medications with the ability to penetrate membranes and kill bacteria can be used for treatment, there will be no changes midway. Even if you engage in strenuous exercise after recovery, there will be no problem. However, most of the gonorrhea medications sold on the market are defective, so you may be delayed in distinguishing between true and false and risk being misled by inferior medicines. Currently, the most trusted treatment for gonorrhea by patients and doctors is "Anti-Gon," made from yellow pigment preparations. To choose a truly effective gonorrhea treatment, it may take half an experience to know. Those who have taken "Anti-Gon" and recovered can all attest to it.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Nocturnal Emission Can Shorten Your Life <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The horror of nocturnal emission is probably unmatched by any other sexually transmitted disease. But this terrible thing is also particularly prevalent among young people. Therefore, the number of young people who indirectly or directly have their lives cut short by nocturnal emission has been statistically estimated to account for 37% or so. Then, averaging this over a population of 400 million, there would be 14.8 million lives lost annually due to nocturnal emission. This loss is truly a loss for the entire nation, and no one can ignore it!</p>
<p>The relationship between nocturnal emission and loss of life is as described above. Then, why do young people suffer from this terrible disease? The main reason is caused by masturbatory behavior. Therefore, young people must never become addicted to the bad habit of masturbation, otherwise, in a very short time, it will cause a neurasthenia to erupt. Therefore, people with masturbation mostly have tinnitus, headaches, dizziness, mental fatigue, insomnia, and other symptoms. It is best not to marry before this disease is cured, because after marriage, it will make treatment difficult. This is very important common sense and should be remembered. At the same time, quickly seek treatment. You should know that the cause of nocturnal emission is purely due to the severe depletion of semen in the body. Therefore, the seminal gate is not firm, and the semen will flow out unconsciously. For those whose symptoms worsen, it will also flow out during the day. Therefore, for this disease, you should choose Himitol's "Semen-Stopping Tablets," which have the ability to strengthen the semen, as the most effective treatment. This is an example that never fails. Do not neglect it!</p>
<h3 id="e200">A Message to Patients with Leukorrhea <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, Hong Kong University</p>
<p>Another New Crisis!</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Incompetent doctors harm people, and inferior medicines kill people." This saying contains profound truth. I listened to Mr. Wu and Mr. Yin, who recently came to the clinic as gonorrhea patients, complaining. I believe this even more now. According to them, both gentlemen were misled by the exaggerated claims of a certain incompetent doctor, who retrieved old, non-specific, and ineffective old therapies, pieced them together, and exaggerated them to sell his so-called innovative nostrums. Both took more than ten bottles of them, not only wasting money but also delaying the opportunity for treatment, and so on. After I introduced them to purchase and take the internal yellow pigment preparation "Anti-Gon" from Wing On Company, they were finally cured. I can't help but feel deeply moved. Unexpectedly, recently, the incompetent doctor even attacked the internal yellow pigment. I don't know what he is basing this on. Based on my decades of clinical experience, I have tried countless therapies. In terms of efficacy, none has surpassed the internal yellow pigment. The doctor initially started as an assistant and did not have a graduation diploma. Practicing medicine with only a superficial understanding is already pitiful. How can he be qualified to attack people with false reasoning? For the sake of the future of patients, I cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Indigestion</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Desheng, from Anhui, is now twenty-eight years old. Due to the toil of his occupation and constant running around, he developed indigestion. His appetite decreased sharply, and he felt厌恶at the sight of food. Although the dishes were rich, he felt tasteless. After a long time, his physical strength gradually became unsustainable, eventually leading to muscle wasting and mental fatigue. His family was very worried and took all kinds of stomach-strengthening and digestive medicines sold on the market, but they were of no avail. He was extremely worried. Gradually, he saw in the newspaper that a certain gentleman also suffered from indigestion and was cured after taking "Stomachic Pills." So, following what Mr. So-and-so wrote, he purchased a bottle from Wing On Company and finished it in eight days. It had the miraculous effect of curing the disease as soon as the medicine was taken.</p>
<p>Safe Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Zhao Bin is from Songjiang County and has been addicted to smoking for seven years. At the end of last autumn, he began to make efforts to quit smoking. However, he took many drugs containing side effects, so after taking them for a long time, there was no actual effect, and he wasted money without gaining any real benefit. Friends thought that he was unwilling to quit smoking decisively and often looked down on him. He then sought a spiritual medicine in the hope of breaking away from the suffering as soon as possible. This spring, a good friend gave him a half dozen "Gonadin," which he took internally according to the instructions. Before taking five boxes, he quit smoking. It can be called the most effective and fastest-acting smoking cessation agent.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain Cured</p>
<p>Mr. X "Editor's note: The report came with this symbol, and the real name is unknown." He felt stomach pain after eating and vomited sourness. At the same time, he said that he was restless when sitting or lying down and felt unusually stuffy. He then purchased "Stomach Pain Relief" and took it, and now the illness has been cured.</p>

<p>(1) Dazed and confused, semen dripping</p>
<p>When young men and women reach the age of spring passion, they become impatient and use masturbation as a tool to vent their desires. Therefore, in the darkness, they deplete their semen. As a result, the seminal gate is relaxed, and nocturnal emission is unavoidable. This is despised as a common disease among young people.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Tang and Jin both committed masturbation and both had several years of experience. Therefore, when sleeping, they always felt dazed and confused, and after waking up, their pants were full of semen. This was despised as an accumulated habit. Recently, they suffered from severe neurasthenia, and various diseases arose. Their faces were like ghosts. They were greatly frightened and came to me for diagnosis and treatment. I treated their nocturnal emission mainly with Himitol's Semen-Stopping Tablets and told them to take "Gonadin" again to nourish their vitality. Yesterday, Mr. Jin introduced his relative to me for diagnosis and treatment of smoking addiction. I learned that he had returned to the path of health.</p>
<p>(2) Concubines filling the hall, muscles wasting</p>
<p>Human energy is limited. If it is overused, all the muscles in the body will be exhausted, and the reproductive function will inevitably decline. With muscle wasting, there is no hope of health. Therefore, the government strictly stipulates a monogamous system. This is the reason. Now there is Mr. Zhang, from Tongxiang, Zhejiang, who is wealthy and has four or five concubines in his home. It can be said that there is no gap in the day, resulting in a thin body and insufficient energy. He sought various nourishing medicines. Last spring, he came to Shanghai once and came to me to ask for a nourishing prescription. I told him that "Gonadin," a gonadal hormone preparation, can supplement all physical losses, essence depletion, premature aging, and other symptoms. He bought two dozen. According to a recent letter, he is full of energy and his muscles are full.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Has Abyssinia Fallen? <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>Italy has long publicly declared the annexation of Abyssinia. The Abyssinian Emperor's speech at the League of Nations has also become a historical record. Even this stubborn emperor seems to have become discouraged. According to Reuters, he arrived in London from Geneva, "looking dejected." — The so-called sanctions against Italy will also be announced to be lifted from the 15th.</p>
<p>However, has Abyssinia really fallen from now on?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not! Whether the Abyssinian Emperor is "looking dejected" or not, we cannot determine the future of Abyssinia based on this. The League of Nations has long been defiled by the great powers. This is an obvious fact. Weak countries cannot rely on the League of Nations to survive. This lesson does not need to be learned by Abyssinia. We Chinese have long suffered enough. If the Abyssinian Emperor is truly "looking dejected" because of the disappointment given to him by the League of Nations this time, then it is only the Abyssinian Emperor's personal matter. The people of Abyssinia, in their recently published declaration, said clearly: "All the people of Abyssinia, except those in Addis Ababa, who are under the oppression of the Italian army and cannot move, have unanimously decided that as soon as the rainy season arrives, they will continue to resist the enemy, even if they are empty-handed, they will fight to the end to defend their country's independence and drive the brutal enemy out of their sacred land. Otherwise, anyone who is worthy of the name of Abyssinian will fight until not a single person is left..."</p>
<p>From this, we know how the people of Abyssinia are determined to have no enemy but themselves. If they do not "drive the brutal enemy" "out of the sacred land," then the people of Abyssinia will "fight until not a single person is left." This is not only said grandly in the declaration, but the facts also tell us: "...In the past two months, armed and elite 'bandits' (?) fiercely resisted the Italian army. One night in the Abyssinian capital, many Italian soldiers were found with their throats cut...The Italian army is mostly stationed in large cities due to difficult transportation to the interior and dare not go far. Several hundred Italian troops in Asba-Sassa-Fari were surrounded by thousands of armed Abyssinians. The Italian authorities said that they cannot be rescued." (Reuters, Cairo, 6th)</p>
<p>From the above telegram, it clearly tells us: Abyssinia has not been destroyed by Italy! Although Mussolini is elated and says that he has annexed Abyssinia, the reality is not entirely so.</p>
<p>Now, the rainy season is about to begin. After reading the above declaration, what will we think? However, we know that if we really only have "empty hands," it is very difficult to "fight to the end" (the past battles, as well as waiting for the rainy season to begin so that the Italian army's planes cannot operate, are not the best illustrations?). Therefore, we express extraordinary sympathy and hope for their "appeal to the British people in the name of a dying nation to provide assistance in raising 5 million to 6 million pounds of public bonds for the purpose of resisting the enemy in the parts of the country not occupied by the Italian army." We hope that just people all over the world can lend a hand to this "dying nation." They said, "We do not currently ask other countries to send troops to help us, nor do we want soldiers from other countries to lightly shed a drop of blood to save our country's independence. What we ask for is only a small amount of money to purchase arms. Once we have arms, the rest of the work can be done by Abyssinian soldiers themselves"! To such earnest and tragic words, to such a pitiful and brave nation, are we really going to watch them "fight until not a single person is left"? Is world justice really always in the hands of the great powers?</p>
<p>China's fate today is not above Abyssinia. Abyssinia has prepared for a "unanimous decision" to fight to the end. What about us?</p>
<p>The Abyssinian people's declaration excites us and also makes us confident: We are confident that Abyssinia will not perish! In the lessons of blood, we see what the inevitable fate of small and weak nations is?</p>
<p>What we have to do is: How to "defend our country's independence!"</p>

<h3 id="e202">Seaside <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>Walking out of the east gate of Baoshan County, the scene before us seemed to suddenly open up. An unusual, pleasant, and fresh feeling shot straight into our minds like an arrow. All of a sudden, a fresh and soft sea breeze floated over, driving away the dark shadows. The mind, which had been blocked by the coal smoke of the city, was also gradually blown open by this beautiful and magnificent nature, blown open.</p>
<p>My childhood temperament broke out again, and I ran wildly and ecstatically onto this river embankment. An indescribable joy tore me away from everything and gave me to Mother Nature. Even if this was a great sin, I might be willing to accept the unjustness.</p>
<p>A roar came from the bottom of my heart—Mother Nature! Why don't you surge your waves, wash away all the ugliness in this world, and submerge this unreasonable old society? May you respond to the heart's voice of these millions of righteous people, who urgently need your encouragement, who are willing to stir up the storm of this era!</p>
<p>The heroic posture of the waves crashing on the shore is very moving. The waves struggling with the boulders, being squeezed and bursting out in all directions, are so spirited. The sound of battle when rushing to fight—the "crashing, crashing, crashing—sand!" shouting, is like the last roar of millions of oppressed people: majestic and breaking the enemy's courage.</p>
<p>This is Wusongkou, where the Huangpu River flows into the sea. In front of us is a vast expanse of white, and the horizon is nowhere to be seen. At the end of our vision, a line of gray stripes separates the two seas—the ever-changing sea of clouds and the surging waves. In this crude picture, there are also a few elegant and noble sails embellishing it. Sometimes, when looking at traditional Chinese paintings, I always feel that adding a few sails is pretentious and deliberately separates the painting from reality. This concept has now been denied by myself, but I am not saying that the sails in traditional Chinese paintings are appropriate. On the contrary, I am just admiring the courage of these small creatures struggling with nature. Combined with the surging waves, it is not contradictory, but harmonious, mutually reflecting the beauty of "strength."</p>
<p>It is a cloudy day. No sun. No storm. However, I don't know by what force, the crests of the waves, like millions of arms linked together, stretched out their giant palms, towering high, and proudly expressing their anger!—The anger suppressed for who knows how many years, the anger erupting from the hearts of millions of people!</p>
<p>"Be braver, young people!</p>
<p>Relying on the strength of millions of us,</p>
<p>Tear apart the old,</p>
<p>Relying on the strength of millions of us,</p>
<p>Create the new!........."</p>
<p>Encouraged by Mother Nature, I sang madly like this.</p>
<p>When my travel companion told me that the friend who was seeing us off had left us and returned to Baoshan City, I woke up a little. At this time, I realized that I was still in this chaotic society. However, what made me happy was that I remembered: In this long journey of endurance, I am no longer lonely. I have not only found travel companions, but there are not just one, but millions. So, clasping the hand of this friend, we resolutely embarked on this small journey of ours with a brisk pace, with joy and delight.</p>
<p>We both promised each other: We would walk along the seaside until we reached Wusong Town, and then change ships. This small walk would take about fifty or sixty minutes, or perhaps even more. During this time, we would be accompanied by this roaring sea until we were forced to leave it by the ruthless environment.</p>
<p>These times are very precious. We cherish them. We don't want to waste them even a little. We don't even want to spend them in meaningless conversations. Therefore, during these times, we entrusted our whole body and mind to our mother—this magnificent and surging sea. That is to say, even the beating of our hearts follows the crashing of the waves.</p>
<p>My love for the seaside is not a rare sight in my youth. I have had intermittent seaside life for nearly two years; living by the seaside, from childhood, I don't know how many days. I don't know how many stories I have about the seaside alone. I can't remember them all at this time. I would like to have an opportunity to tell the beautiful and ordinary seaside stories to my heart's content. However, time is sometimes very cruel, and before I could swallow my fill of this sea and sky, I was forced to board the small train to the metropolis again. It dragged me step by step away from the realm I loved and threw me back into the crucible of life.</p>
<p>I miss this seaside journey. I yearn for that second time when we are completely free.</p>

<p>The Dragon Boat Tragedy</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival has arrived again, and the southerners living in the semi-tropics are enthusiastically starting dragon boat races. Two days ago, my brother asked me to go home, but I didn't go after all. I said, "What's the point? The countryside is just annoying!" Actually, I had already promised Annie. I was going to watch the dragon boat races with her in the provincial capital. She would jump up and down like a child. She grew up in Guangzhou and knows everything better than I do. So, I didn't want to leave the provincial capital, waiting like a hungry cat for the arrival of that strange dragon boat comedy.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun was fiercely burning the roads of Shameen, and the doors of all the shops along the road were tightly closed. Everyone was celebrating the festival, the day to commemorate Qu Yuan! However, this has become a superstitious custom for people. Few people know what the meaning of the Dragon Boat Festival is!</p>
<p>Running out onto the road, I saw dragon boats on land making loud noises. A long dragon, its colorful colors swaying in the white sunlight, with more than ten people riding inside its belly, strutting around so arrogantly - this is a dragon! But, seeing them everywhere made me feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Annie and I went to Shameen, that paradise-like place - that's the imperialists' concession! That day, it seemed to be under martial law, refusing entry to many people who didn't look like upper-class people. However, we finally ran in, and on that shaded coastline, like guests in a paradise, we leaned back in our chairs, breathing in the fresh sea breeze, watching the small boats floating on the turbulent White Swan Lake.</p>
<p>"Here they come! Look, those three dragon boats are desperately rushing over!"</p>
<p>Annie pouted her little mouth, pointing to the dragon boats flying over the white waves. They were racing fast, the sound of gongs and drums, shouts, like the world was coming undone, looking like three mad dragons roaring. My heart was also pounded urgently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we saw an electric boat, neither too big nor too small, flying in from afar into White Swan Lake. Its crazed appearance was enough to prove that it was full of "powerful people," perhaps people who came to watch the dragon boat comedy. However, this electric boat rushed towards the dragon boats on this side recklessly, a sight that made the heart tremble. It was truly terrifying:</p>
<p>"Alas! Lai! Look, the waves of White Swan Lake are very turbulent!"</p>
<p>Annie's eyes were clearly filled with worry and fear.</p>
<p>I held my breath. I completely forgot why I was standing so still on the beach, watching. I was even more afraid to hear that terrible wail:</p>
<p>"Hey! Avoid! Avoid!"</p>
<p>This was a roar from the dragon boat, but it was too late. The electric boat had approached the small dragon boat. Both sides went from anxiety to roar, but the electric boat was ultimately arrogant, or it didn't avoid and rushed over. The people on the dragon boat couldn't suppress their anger and raised their paddles, yet they couldn't disregard the small boat swaying in the huge waves. In the midst of the shouting, we heard and saw gunshots fired from the electric boat. The people on the dragon boat closest to the electric boat fell into the water. In the raging waves, a dragon boat overturned, and more than fifty people were submerged in the water of White Swan Lake.</p>
<p>The electric boat still sailed safely into the city, but our eyes were watching that tragedy, and our eyes became blurred.</p>
<p>"Ah! Such a barbaric world!"</p>
<p>Annie's eyes became moist. She looked at me, and then at the blue sky. The sun in the sky was shining brightly on the surface of White Swan Lake, the white waves still floating without any change, the sea breeze still coolly blowing on us. However, my face drooped, and I didn't dare to look at the waves anymore.</p>
<p>The next morning, we saw this news in the newspaper:</p>
<p>"An electric boat carrying the Huo family members went to the province to watch the dragon boat races. Due to a head-on collision with a dragon boat, the dragon boat overturned, killing more than thirty people!"</p>
<p>After reading it, my heart became even more uneasy and waves arose, "Why can't the newspaper say a few more words! Why is it so calm!"</p>
<p>Annie covered my mouth with her hand, meaning there was no need to say it. I sighed and closed my eyes!</p>

<p>The Western Palace is quiet at night, fragrant with hundreds of flowers. I want to roll up the pearl curtain, but my spring sorrows are long. The Noble Consort sits alone by the sandalwood desk. Burning red candles, waiting for the emperor. Gao Lishi, tell the Empress, the Emperor will spend tonight at Zhaoyang Palace. When Taizhen hears this, her sorrows deepen. Lazily, she removes her palace makeup. She falls asleep in her clothes on the quilt. She sees a bright moon shining on the palace walls. The lonely and cold pillow is a desolate sleep, and countless heartbroken tears run down her cheeks. I advise people not to accompany the emperor. Accompaning the emperor is like accompanying a tiger. I think of how beautiful the Empress is. Why did he leave me by the wayside? It's better to marry a romantic man, spending time together happily from morning till night. Zivei flowers face Zivei man.</p>
