<h3>林主席計演大要</h3>
<p>（南京）林主席四日晨在國府紀念週講「建設國家的根本方針」、首謂今天爲五四運動紀念日、我們回想當年的靑年運動、其目的就是要伸張民權、擁護國家主權、明日五五爲宣佈憲法草案之　憲政的第一天、此卽適應我們一方面把民權提高、一方面耍大家一致努力國家建設的意思、决謂總理手訂之建國大綱第一條條文、卽爲吾人建設國家一個根本方針、大凡一個國家、經過一番革命破壞後、同時亦耍非常建設、繼續在後面、要是沒有這種建設、革命便會沒有意義、建設工作較破壞工作困難得多、因爲建設工作需要全國通力合作、上下一致、並且還要具有種種條件、才可以完成、建設工作既如此困難、故事前如無整理計劃按步就班去實行、就難免不事倍功半、總理最近看淸此點、所以當進行革命破壞時、同時預備一建設方案、令我們去遵守奉行、建國大綱便是方案的一個大網、舉凡建國方針、建國目標、以及建國程序、都有規定、此卽總理思想結晶所在、亦卽爲圖國家長治久安之大計、總理觀察世界潮流、審度本國國情、用他獨到的見解、規定以三民主義和五權憲法作爲建設國家根本方針、原來三民主義的意義、就是要把一切不平等都打成平等、從國內的民有民治民享做到全世界的共有共治共享、換言之、就是以救國爲起點、以世界大同爲目的、至於五權憲法、原是總理集合中外精華所造成的一個很好的完璧、只有根據五權憲法所造成的政府、才算是世界上最完備的政府、三民主義和五權憲法、既然具有這種特長、所以要建設中華民國、就要本着這個方針去進行、像這樣造成的國家、人民才纔能獲得眞正的平等、而我們國家强盛了以後、也才不會再去侵略人家、不僅不會去侵略人家、幷且照三民主義的特性說來、更必然的會把全世界人類都造成平等、實現大同世界、所以三民主義的道理、第一步是救國、推廣起來、也是救世界的和平主義、與人類有莫大的幸福、我們如能一步一步把他實現起來、其精深博大、非其他主義所可及的、（四日中央社電）</p>

<p>今茲憲法草案之公布全國人民舉以忻幸之態度作鄭重之注意矣夫人民非不知此百四十八條條文公布雖在今日實際施行猶待半年後國民大會之最後議定也亦非不知三民五權之新憲法文雖具眞實之效益半須視踐行之誠意與毅力而决也其所以急於表示忻幸與鄭重者亦見其盼望憲政之殷切而已</p>
<p>孫中山先生革命之最終目標爲憲法之治現代國家之法治亦以憲法爲基礎顧中華民國成立二十五年以政治之影響使國家根本大法迄未製定實施更以國家未有對政府人民具同等的束力之憲法使政治難與現代憲政各國比觀國難以後開放政權之要求與國民黨四屆三中全會之「集中國力挽救危亡案」共同表現其對於憲政之需要於是自二十一年十二月開始黨最高機關及國民政府立法院各致力於愼製憲草與籌開國民大愈閱時三載餘乃有今日之成續</p>
<p>憲草今日之公布所以爲國民大會討論之豫備與前此之徵求意見者不同然國民大會代表旣代人民行使四權卽有代表民意之作用國民對於憲法之意見縱不必向完畢起草責任之立法院要求採納尚可對將來之國民大會代表作貢獻以爲討論時之參考記者固知此决憲草易稿七度公刋四次於黨最高機關所定原則外對各方意見已多採納此百四十八條之製成可謂已極審愼惟憶二十三年五中全會審議前草案時之决議有「中華民國憲法草案應遵奉總理之三民主義以期建立民有民治民享之國家同時應審察中華民族目前之環境及其危險斟酌實際政治經騐以造成運用靈敏能集中國力之制度……」等語則國民意見除違反三民主義精神者外關於現實環境者儘有對國民大會代表貢獻之可能夫無謂之聚讼固非所取耍點之檢討則屬需要此國民對於今日憲草之公布所以不能僅以忻幸鄭重爲已足而猶須爲精密之研究也</p>
<p>至若言及對於憲草成爲正式憲法而實施時之準備則國民所應努力者允多舉其大者如四權之運用如何根據訓政的法時之經騐使之發達地方自治如何完成憲草中所具特點頗多如何使之發生實際效益此皆須以積極態度引起其正當之政治興趣始可無負於憲法也</p>

<p>力爭要點</p>
<p>請以南孔江爲滇緬天然界綫、理由爲緬甸歷爲中國藩屬、於遜淸光緒十一年、被英人以武力攫奪而緬甸域外、滾龍江以東一帶地段、對於我方奉命惟謹、而英方政令尙未達到、當然係我領土、英方全無理由、强名之曰未完界、更無理由侵入我縣中部、爲防微杜漸、制止英方無饜野心計、務請以南孔江爲天然界錢、用保邊疆而挽主權、　十一家召華地應請劃歸我國、理由査十一家召華地、前曾接受我國委任、有印信可稽、自應劃歸我國、如果此决因中委許可英軍入境、用武力恐駭、金錢誘惑之種種手段致其茫無所從、將來十一家召華地劃歸英方、須要中委負責挽回、</p>
<p>英方陰謀</p>
<p>關於滇緬界務中之英方陰謀詭計、實不勝枚舉、當遜淸光緒年間、英人以勘界機會、得在我滇邊（瀾滄）屬地活動、卽專在最高山土、作種種陰謀設施、如所謂「打日光電」、「看望遠鏡」、斫伐樹林、埋藏石頭等等、一般民衆、因不解其用意、尙以爲無關大要、至永偉理努力敎務侵略時始引起宿念、知英人在高峯觀及孔明山等山斫伐大樹、埋藏石頭、用心乃在預埋記號、好作後來騙界之證據、一時爲愛國心所衝動、乃自動各處挖掘、但因年深日久、先前英人埋石之處、無從認識、僅在落水洞地方掘得一塊、上面尙可看出字跡、此外西彌山（卽西盟）司格德也埋有三處、相傳刻有字跡、數年前經掘過一决、但亦未掘着、此種情形、雖不能斷定對方當時之用意、但知此决勘界爭持結果、萬一彼方不得如願以償、難保不以此爲證、作爲爭界理由、故吾入謹在此先加以揭露、俾當局知其底細、國人知其用心、不致爲其陰謀所欺騙、則非徒瀾滄全縣之福、亦雲南全省、中國全國之幸也、</p>

<h3>調查華北走私眞相畢　羅斯昨晨返滬</h3>
<p>卽午謁財孔宋子文亦在座</p>
<p>電英政府報吿回國期未定</p>
<p>英國特派來華之經濟專員李滋羅斯爵士、再度北上、分赴平津、調査華北走私眞相、及其對於英國權利之影響、現已事畢、偕同夫人於二日由平乘車南旋、前晚過京未停留、逕行返滬、於昨晨七時五十分抵北站下車、其助理巴志君赴站决迎迓、羅斯下車後、當赴外灘華懋飯店休息、旋卽於十一時三刻、赴中央銀行謁見財長孔祥熙、時全國經濟委員會常委兼中國銀行董事長宋子文亦在座、羅斯述其此行調査經過、並有所商談、歷一小時之久始辭出、並悉羅斯此行調査經過、除已向孔財長報吿外、當卽電其本國政府報吿、蓋以其政府現極注意此事、其北上調査、本已奉命、又據羅斯助理巴忠君謂渠等何時離華回國、現仍未定、</p>

<h3>德經濟考察團長　克撲昨日抵滬</h3>
<p>吾認曾簽訂德偽通商協定</p>
<p>謂不過爲非正式商業契據</p>
<p>德國遠東經濟考察團團長克撲博士、由日本再度來華、業於昨日下午三時、乘大來公司孟祿總統號輪抵滬、克氏對簽訂所謂「德僞通商協定」、竟予吾認、茲分誌其抵滬情形及談話如次、</p>
<p>抵滬情形</p>
<p>該輪原定於二時卽可抵滬、嗣延至三時方到、泊浦東白蓮涇大來碼頭、克氏此决自日來華、行蹤甚秘、並其夫人亦未同來、孟祿總統號輪旅客單中、未列其名、新聲社記者初遍訪無着、嗣晤及往迎之德國新聞社社長葛麟甫、始經介紹相見、克氏下輸後、卽換乘接客小輪渡浦、於四時正至新關碼頭登岸、首赴黃浦路德國領事署休息、克氏此來、有相當勾留、並將晋京謁我當局、解釋一切、傳克氏將於今晨乘原輪返歐之說、殊屬不確、</p>
<p>克氏談話</p>
<p>據克氏於輪决向新聞記者談、報載本人在日簽訂「德偽通商恊定」、實屬不確、所傳殆係一種非正式商業合的（Commercial　Arrangement）之誤、並非任何協定或條的、此全爲外匯關係、無絲毫政治意味、當更不致涉及承認僞滿之嫌、且本入非政府現役官員、脫離官塲已三年、此决不過以私人資格、擔任遠東經濟考察團團長之職、謀臻進德國與遠東貿易關係而已云云、今抵滬後、在滬究勾留若千時、何時晉京、現尙未定、將來經暹羅轉道回國、惟行期亦尙未决定云、</p>

<h3>因走私等關係　南華航業一落萬丈</h3>
<p>私糖充斥國糖呆滯</p>
<p>幣值相差商業不振</p>
<p>閩航變態日般獨增</p>
<p>南華之汕港粵閩各埠、往來貨物、向極夥多、近兩月來、情勢大變、一落萬丈、根本主因、在華北之私貨充斥、而影響及於華南貨運、滬上中外航輪、咸蒙重大打擊、亟將此事詳情、分述如下、</p>
<p>私糖影響國糖</p>
<p>廣東糖暢銷上海、兼售揚子江各埠、因進口免稅、較洋糖價爲廉、故粵糖在滬、已占極大勢力、廣東有四廠趕造、大批均從汕頭下船運滬、近兩個月中、因華北走私、漏稅糖已私售至上海、及長江各埠、據調査結果、私糖每担價在十四元以下、粵糖先售二十一元、後跌至十九元、近又减去二元、仍不及私貨價之廉、因之粵糖到滬、堆積無算、招商局一家代運者、南棧各處堆糖已難容積、近半月來、由汕裝來之粵糖、已改卸北棧矣、存儲愈多、則積壓愈甚、而銷路愈滯、上星期內、粵方已實行减少運滬糖、且因受走私之根本運銷打擊、在華北華中去數大落、故兩廠已停、自本月下旬起、粵糖將暫行停止裝來上海云、</p>
<p>幣制轉變商業</p>
<p>廣東本以毫洋爲單位、向來採辦上海去貨、亦以毫洋市價、合作上海大洋計算、大致照申價的增百分之二十强、今粵省亦遵照中央新制度、改革流通之毫洋、而採用法幣制、在此過渡時期、申粵間之匯價、無形中發生一種新的變態、上海法幣一元、值廣東法幣一元五角、因幣制上之轉變、而由滬運粵貨、無形中須較前提高百分之二十五、但成本雖高、而到粵後出售、仍難增價、廣帮因血本攸關、除必要品不得不酌辦外、其他貨物、（上海運粵貨、以紗布疋頭香烟雜糧洋雜貨爲大宗）、均抱觀望態度、以致上海運往汕厦粵之去貨、突然銳落、殆减百分之四十、滬上中外各輪公司之南華班航業、均受重大打擊、太古怡和等尙有一部轉口貨抱注、招商局因此路營業不佳、業將南華班輪、僅四新輪每星期改開一班、每月少航四决至五次、此亦航界之大不景氣也、</p>
<p>滬閩輪亦不振</p>
<p>上海至福州一路、本年雖經閩建廳、將涵江開濬、南台可以通行海輪、但因　日貨暢銷、福建國貨受壓迫、　浙贛路通車、運往閩贛邊境之貨、改由車運、以致上海裝入福州去貨、亦見衰落、招商之滬閩輪新銘改走北洋、三北之萬象改駛長江、靖安輪往來滬閩、祇得二三成儎脚、日本船之航行上海到福州者、反在此不振時期中、由三艘增加至六船、其原因所在、不難推索、</p>

<h3>中華民族生活之觀察</h3>
<p>— 新運視察團副團長劉翔</p>
<p>一個民族的構成，從社會得觀點來批判，當然不外自然和文化兩方面，自然是客觀的環境，文化是主觀的力量，一個民族因爲要適應他所處的客觀環境的緣故，因此他的主觀力量，却不得不隨着客觀而演變，古代人類是「人與獸爭」的階段，所以他們的文化，是石器陶器的時代，近代人類是「人同天爭」的階段，所以他們的文化，是科學化學的時代，現代人類除了「人同天爭」以外，更加了「人同人爭」的趨向，所以他們的文化，除了科學化學以外，也更要加上了政治經濟諸問題。因此證明了一個民族的存在與生長否。他的文化應該適應着他們的環境，同時他們的環境，也藉着他們的文化而更見開展，所謂「進化論」，所謂「生存競爭」，所謂人口問題，這一切的一切，簡而言之，就是研究一個民族在現階段裏是進展還是沒落？</p>
<p>研究一個民族，他的文化是否適合於客觀環境，不管從文化上表現也好，從客觀的反映也好，民族的生活就是這一個問題的焦點。</p>
<p>中國民族經過了四千多年的演變，時而盛，時而衰，到了現在已經是走上最尖端的時代了。從外國的環境說，列强各帝國主義人口的增加，文化的發展，經濟的銳進，中國民族量和質的第一位，已經早就由動搖而趨於崩潰了！從內在的情况說，農村破產，天災匪禍，民族的危機，更深刻地潛伏着。在這兒似乎中國客觀環境愈其困難，中國民族的生活，愈難適應。這幾年來，怨天允人的悲觀派，浪漫頹廢的失望者，出賣民族的失去良心的人，在在皆是。其實大家都忘記了，客觀的不幸，是從自已生活不能適應時代的緣故而來，倒果爲因，永遠只期待着，幸運的降臨，守株豈止失兔，印度所以亡，猶太所以亡，中國民族如不自圖挽救，亦何嘗不可以亡！</p>
<p>我們再要革新一個民族生活以前，先决的認識，須從這一個民族縱的和橫的兩方面，加以解剖，然後我們才能瞭然其癥結所在，而加以糾正與指導！</p>
<p>中國民族從周秦一直到了現在止，民族的生活史上，約有四次的大分野，每一次分野裏，這一個民族的生活都有一個劇烈的轉變，從舊的階段裏，把他們的生活，重新適應到另一個新的階段去，</p>
<p>第一個分野，爲周秦時代，那時候的漢族，是在黃河流域繁殖着，外有夷狄，內有天災，而我們民族是怎樣在奮鬥裏生長下去，至少那時候民族的生活，是尙武的，是擁護領袖的，是努力生產的，是崇尙道德的，所謂「我土維王，我伐維功！」和「耕以其時，民其享之！」「敎以其道，民其義之！」這就可以證明那時生活的一斑了。一到了戰國時候，一般人的生活，漸趨自私自利，和浪漫消費之途，所謂「上下交征利則其國危！」「廐有肥馬，野有餓殍！」所以終竟亡於秦，而秦終竟受困於胡！</p>
<p>第二次的分野，是從漢代一直到了六朝止，在這一個分野裏，中國民族，已經向着長江流域進展。那時候民族的生活，可以分做三段落來說：漢代的武功，漢代的文化，漢代的政治，證明了這一個民族有劇烈地向外發展的事實，而且他們的生活，是惇樸的，嚴肅的，生產的。所謂「民間非宴會無裘葛，」「十室之家必有藏糧，」而一般氣節的事情，也是漢代最多，如下式輸將，蘇武不屈，緹縈救父。可見當時的民族精神如何了，這是第一階段的。我們再看到兩晋時候，民族生活是怎樣？一般人的習尙是誇大的，不生產的，沒有紀律的，在上者淸談，在下者閒逸，而且「五石散」同鴉片烟一樣的毒品，是那時候最風行的嗜好，所以西晋亡，東晋裂，八王叛，五胡亂，終晋的時候，中華民族是沒有寗日的！這是第二階段。我們再看下去，南北朝時代，我們民族的生活是怎樣的，浪漫頹廢，風流淫奢，金陵脂粉的遺跡，和江南士大夫的享樂，中國民族的衰弱，可以說那一時代是到了極度了！這是這一次分野裏第三個階段。</p>
<p>第三次的分野，是從隋唐一直到南北宋止，在這一次分野裏，民族生活，可以分做兩階段來說：第一階段，是漢族復興的唐代，從那時候政績裏看到的，如太宗的文治，開元的修明，征突厥，伏吐蕃，通朝鮮，入南洋，中華民族是怎樣的繁殖着。他們的生活，是堅毅的，艱苦的，向上的，訓練的，當時「屯軍」的制度，可以說是現在的軍訓，當時「科農」的制度，可以說是現在的復興農村的前影。唐代一般人民們，也是久經患難，處身潔樸的，雖然殘唐和安史之亂，中間不無弱點！第二階段是衰弱的宋朝，我們一看到歷史，就會記起宋朝的民族。是終其年代，被壓迫於遼金蒙古的，的確那時候民族的生活是怎樣？佛老的思想非常流行，士大夫只談理性，而忘却了武備，民間只知酷愛和平偷生着，而不知道振作。北宋亡，南宋在江南，當時朝野粉飾太平的生活，以古證今，相差奚幾！所以困於遼，屈於金，終竟亡於元。</p>
<p>第四次的分野，是中國民族由元而明而淸，前後兩次亡了國的時代。可是我們在這一次分野裏，我們可以看到當時中華民族以漢族爲本位地推展他們同化的大力量。把漢族當時的衰頹生活叅進「女眞」「鐵木兒」的精神，中華民族生活史又爲之一變，世界歷史上有名的「黃禍」，中華版圖有史以來破天荒的擴大，至今民族英雄成吉思汗，還爲人們所讚頌，當時中國民族生活，可以說是整個軍隊化，所謂古代戰車鐵騎的生活。明代雖然在民族武力上是非常薄弱的，不過中華民族經濟的繁榮，明代多少是做到的，中國唯一航行家的三保太監，第一次由海道到南洋去的，而且那時候民族生活，多少還保留着一點元代所遺留下來的向外發展的精神，到了淸代的時候，這是中華民族一個劇烈演變的時候了，淸朝的前半紀，是怎樣的英武，因而民間的生活是怎樣的勤愼簡樸，可是後半紀以還，中國內政的腐敗，外交的失策，處處都表現出這一個民族生活的黑暗與動搖，沒有一點生命力，只要看到鴉片的流行，就可以槪括當時的一切！</p>
<p>當然在沒有檢視現階段的生活以前，從歷史的觀察，我們可以歸納起評判一下，中華民族，他們的興衰，完全是關係在他們的生活怎樣，假使他們的生活，能够振作起來，不管客觀的環境是怎樣，複雜與困難，事實上也都能够起來適應而發展的，請看今日我們民族的環境與生活是怎末一回局面？</p>
<p>目下國際的環境，在兩個不同的方式裏，望着中國包圍第一個以市塲爲目標地，企圖世界的再分配，阿比西利亞已經見併於意大利，德奧問題的嚴重，蘇彝士運河的波潮，直布羅海峽的緊張，西方的黑影，更足加速遠東與中國的危機，中華民族處在日俄兩個大國的裏面，不管是赤化亞洲也好，門羅亞洲也好，這個民族都沒有立足的可能，第二個以自然的生存律，在優勝劣敗的公例下面，向中華民族包圍着，中國人口的停滯，中國蘊藏的委棄，民族武力的薄弱，民族生活的腐敗，反證到其他如英格遜，拉丁，高家素，太和，條頓睹民族的繁榮，科學的進步，軍備的擴張，加以人口的增加，土地不敷，原料將竭，殖民地的不均，生活條件的種種需要，非開始侵略弱者實無法解决其內在的矛盾，而老大的中華民族，適當其衝！但是我們反觀中國民族，今後對此複雜困難的環境，將怎樣起而適應與鬥爭呢？不特沒有這樣的準備和訓練，而且依然更深刻地墮落下去，我們證之歷史上過去亡國的原因，實不寒而憟！</p>
<p>當然的我們現在更需要問到，目下我們民族的生活，要怎樣來適應這複雜的環境呢？這兒只有三個的路向，給我們奮進：第一個以民族自衛的生活，來對付國際複雜的環境，一九三六年的世界，雖然是弱小民族處處被人家所欺凌的年代，同時也是弱小民族搆成反抗戰綫的大聯合的同盟期。我們只要看到埃及，最近的阿刺伯民族抗英運動，土耳其武裝達達尼爾和博斯波魯斯海峽，西班牙人民陣綫的威力，奧國邊境部隊的調動，沒有一個弱小民族，不是在努力他們自衛的工作，中國民族在這樣國際環境裏，唯一的澈底手段，就是起而拱衛我們的國土！因爲我們要拱衛自己的緣故，所以生活要軍事化，組織自己，訓練自己，紀律是我們生活的精神，機械是我們生活的秩序，平時是民族的搆成員，戰時都是民族的戰士。其次以民族自給的生活，來對付國際經濟恐慌的環境，中國國民經濟的現階段，並不是分配不均，而是沒有生產，中國經濟的出路，並不是想侵略人家，而是獨立自己民族的生活，而不耍仰息於別人的。唯一的問題，就是要生產化。年來國際經濟情况，蘇聯之放棄器械的社會主義經濟政策，美國的大規模統制方法，英國的殖民壁壘，法國的金集中，德國的新國債協定，無一不是努力做養的工作，以應付非常時局。當然的中國也是不可例外，中國今日養的工作，似乎比別人更重要些，所謂戰無餘糧，室如懸罄，雖然决心一幹，事實上不可允許，所以我們因爲養的緣故，民族生活需要簡單樸素，節的消費，努力生產，平時注重各種集體的儲蓄，勞作的增加，戰時統制物質的原料，限止各個人的浪費，在各方面貧困的環境裏，我們奠下一個基礎來。其三就是以民族自愛的生活，來匡維這一個消沉的，散漫的民族意識，以應付眼前這樣尖銳的國際時代，我們環觀四圍，最近日耳曼民族之英雄主義再起，歐洲條頓民族思想之右傾，斯拉夫民族紅色組織之嚴密，大和民族之亞洲生命綫提倡，無一不是鼓起民族精神的緊張，以解决各個人的難關，中國年來民族意識的動搖，「人皆可君」的傾向，已造成大批出賣民族的漢奸，所以我們的民族的生活，要藝術化，要做到敎的任務，十年敎聚，一戰而覇，「這是歷史上的敎訓，我們現在的生活，最低限度，要做到健康的，理智的，科學的，良知的，致用的生活，旣不是空洞玄虛的修養，而是格心應物的實際道德，也可以說是從人性的本能，而確立生存的要素</p>
<p>的確，我們所企圖革新的生活，不外這三點，敎以立身，養以濟困衛以禦侮，三者是等時性，聯環性，統一性的。假定我們民族生活，果眞做到了這一個階段話，任他客觀環境是怎樣的複雜，都可以適應起來的，「適者生存，」我們民族的復興，事實上固不難計日而待</p>

<p>上塲朱寬即受卻克令之威脅、其本人體格似未恢復原有之強體、在此無劣雅境之下、竟發現一對十之鉅大差數、使一般觀者莫名其妙、幸而朱神色自若、意志冷靜、運用灸略、一再進迫、為時無幾、形勢大變、反以十七對十前導、博得觀者掌聲不少、卻克令眼看前途暗黑、亦加緊工作、追成平局、旋又超前一分、當其時朱寬鐵臂揮出、敵人失色、四仆連下、（以二十一對十八勝第一局、第一局聞始、其情況適與首局相反、朱一氣呵成卜分、郵克令進退失據、勉力奮鬥、始得三分、從雙方相追甚厲、此數成十二對八、從此朱寬輕車熟路、直上書雲、不久即斗二十一對八之結果打敗卻克令、另一場為鮑塞列勝史密斯、成績如下、</p>

<h3>證券　統一甲種又見新高價</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所市况仍極堅穩、各帮及散戶賣　雖盛、而甲種竟又發見六十八元丸角半之新高價、上午形勢頗形疲軟、似已不易上漲、但午後多方之提拉、市氣又轉高昂、多方陋綫仍甚鞏固、依市場人心推測、甲種或可衝出七十元大關、依環境情形觀察、未許過於樂觀、趨勢因易漲而難跌、或將先見高峰、而後下降、昨日經過、午前賣氣爲盛、一時多方拉提之力不　、四號十一及四十七號等之買進、竟不及十五及三十五號以及各帮散戶賣出之盛、趨勢頗形疲軟、每盤均小五分一角至二三角不等、惟甲種比較堅强、且於收盤轉漲五分、人心又爲之稍定、午後形勢因之驟轉、開盤即行趨高、三十五號轉進極湧、僅丁種本月小二角、餘則一致轉昂、甲乙兩種本月份漲四角及叫角半、遠期甲又見六十八元丸角半新高價、收盤交易較遜、並無委頓之象、丁種本月期因七盤獨小、故轉漲三角半亦爲獨多、前途因多方堅强不屈、當尙有掙扎也、市價結果、高低互見、大都近堅遠弱、惟甲種最佳、成交總數、共計三百九十四萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　花紗大跌小回頭</h3>
<p>棉市運跌四日、昨則略形反動回昇、然一般棉商因五六萬包之粗絨棉、一時無法售罄、對於市面極度悲觀、同時現棉廠需滯鈍、惟有一部分已由空翻多矣、</p>
<p>日商拖進新花</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉南方套售而跌四至八磅七五羅比、大阪三品花跌二三角、市場人心依然驚虛、多數看跌、各月均跌二三角、但合興長豐益康紛紛補空、市盤轉趨高翔、由挫回堅、惟元一源興昌多頭了結、空頭加碼、壓迫尙烈、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五分至一角、午後開盤氣勢轉緊、因日商對於十月期新花步步拖進、在此三日中、據云已進二三萬担之譜、但陳花多數議論、謂大跌小回頭、買勢較平、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角半至二角、査賣出賡豐一千一百担、恒益一千担、聚興三千四百担、達記一千担、明德二千九百担、元一六千二百担、泰昌二千一百担、源興昌三千九百祖、森康一千四百担、買進裕康二千担、吉暨一千五百担、合興九千担、長豐五千五百担、潤康二千五百担、益康五千三百担、長和一千七百担、長餘一千一百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>棉花廠需清淡</p>
<p>現棉消費頗滯、廠需殊淸、來源姚花九百五十包、通花九十包、</p>
<p>紗市因連朝狂落、昨則微顯反動回好之象、但市塲多數目標看跌、因倉庫三萬一千餘包之紗、一時缺乏流動性、且堅挺已久、回跌未多、所以空方議論仍屬觀疲、惟有一部分以其比高價時已跌十餘元、意態轉舵、補空翻多矣、</p>
<p>標紗回漲八九角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因空方壓迫劇烈、各月參差不一、多頭猶似驚弓之鳥、拍至遠月均跌六七角、但合興長豐獲利繼續抵補、檯面賴以支持、惟瑞大元一空頭加碼、市盤尙平、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一·三·四角、惟十月跌三角、午後開盤市態略形堅挺、以有一部分買進、至於多頭方面、一般散戶泰半斬結淸楚、惟大戶尙無舉動、因此場中籌碼不若上日之鬆濫、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲三四六·七·八角、査賣出裕大五百包、吉豐六百五十包、聚興七百包、振大一千二百包、賡豐五百五十包、瑞大二千一百包、興昌八百包、元一一千六百五十包、大昌成七百五十包、益昶一千八百五十包、大豐七百五十包、泰興七百包、買進達記六百包、澄記八百包、大孚一千五百五十包、合興三千八百包、　　四百五十包、長豐二千七百五十包、恒昌一千一百五十包、大昶九百包、潤康一千五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>孟買上週棉業不振</h3>
<p>上週棉市、因國外有振、賣勢較優、明年四五月期白羅溪開出後、大批賣出、致全部市況、大受影響、出口問訊平靜、衆意長此靜寂、白羅溪價再跌、或能引起需要、現貨呆滯、基礎較軟、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>疋頭　廠布跌價引銷</h3>
<p>滇粵浙皖均起採辦</p>
<p>昨日棉布疋頭、因上週市况疲憊不堪、雖紗花略現平穩之象、仍有跌價之傾向、振泰寳興兩廠十六·十四磅粗布各跌五分、申新大生廠各牌細布均跌一角、怡和廠粗布跌五分至一角、漂布跌二角、常州各廠雜牌細斜各跌一角外、而東貨跌勢更見猛烈、花色貨售價亦跌、每碼跌二厘半至五厘不等、各貨經此連互之跌價、衡之各客路售盤、已相吻合、故採辦心思、漸見活動、安微帮進本廠細布、申新人鐘、人魚等牌五六十件、雲南廣帮成交下擋本廠細布細斜三百餘件、寗紹帮進東貨細布細斜·粗布及本廠觕布、麗新·華陽·益記·色素府綢、國華·恒豐花布色丁、雜牌元白洋紗等一百餘件、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥跌風仍熾</h3>
<p>粉市晨間開盤後、近遠各月份市價承前昨跌風、開價立即步趨而下、因遠期各月份連日被內地行販與滬廠儘興拋售、業內外空頭更爲盡力加碼、業外大戶心思尙定、然浮散各多已心虛力脫、故粉市乃見逐盤下落、午後各盤賣風仍健、市乃步步下降、收市前以廠空停出、市面方能安定、然今後天氣晴正、新麥豐收有望、則粉市或須冉度下跌也、結果近遠月各小三分左右矣、</p>
<p>麥市晨間開市後承連日跌風壓迫、業外大戶均經停進、浮多空定則已心思不定、而內地行廠已趁勢拋出、在多頭了結與行空競出之下、市價當然逐步降落、但近期各月尙被現貨枯乏所據置、遠期終被空頭加碼所壓落、收市價六七月各小二分、八月小四分、九月小五分、現麥廠方亦欲撳小收貿、但以到存兩少、貨主心思依然堅持、昨日隨市售開山東麥三百包、價仍開五元二角云、</p>
<h3>出口需要轉懈　美麥人心略為看小</h3>
<p>美國小麥市　、台克薩斯與亞克拉化馬甘霖滂沱、有人估計加麥存底共一萬萬五千萬斛、較意料者爲大、出口需要轉懈、人心略爲看小、</p>
<h3>河下米到存兩稀　客秈實銷突然活躍</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭仍旺、而溫台米與江西米允見源源不絕、溫台米因天熱不敢久擱、頗多隨市貶價脫手、而業內外國戶行號等、亦不頣久擱擯守、市面因此頗有逐步狂落　趨勢、但昨日河下米到存兩稀、蘇米來源允見缺之、因此本街實消突然活潑、但以貨主求售、市價仍小五分、江西米開出七千七百五十包、溫台米一千四百包、江北米六百七十包、湘米三百包、沙市米三百包、暹邏四號碎米一百包、統由本街實銷辦法、</p>
<h3>天雨米市略為穩定</h3>
<p>（滬南）　昨日各帮來源、仍祇二十餘號、貨共四千餘石、故本街人心、略爲穩定、銷場較前稍動、市况有帶緊之象、厚早粳新鮮者升起數分至近角、中宿者平平、薄稻包胃仍淡、祇大連帮辦去五六百包、故市色平常、零胃略見帶鮮、杜洋尖亦好數分、陰變元無大上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船三十六七號、因天氣陰　、客方欲喊緊、無奈市上各種銷胃平常、市價高頂粳貨少價挺、中决者疲軟、早薄稻及陰變元價無榮辱、杜埠尖貨稀、價形站立、其餘各貨均見軟勢、</p>
<h3>洋荘芝蔴銷稀轉跌</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油徵升</p>
<p>洋莊芝蔴、雖國內趨勢堅挺、但國外情形軟弱、且有交易所牽制、故去路日少起色、昨祇有東洋帮問津五十噸、價開十三元、比前市跌一角、油豆餅銷場依然淸淡、大連雖云報漲、但恐係暫時性質、不易激動人心、且豆餅去路滯遲、黃豆走銷不活、致市氣呆木、昨黃豆祇由內地零星戶辦去蚌埠豆一車、長春豆一車、本街等採取沙黃杜豆五百五十包、豆油及花生油見砌角譜、然大勢仍不脫盤旋局面、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約生絲進口減少</h3>
<p>紐約生絲存底報吿、四月份生絲進口及銷用均見减退、上海絲運美僅四二五包、無怪上月份申埠絲市之不景氣也、茲將紐的生絲市况、列表於下、</p>
<h3>浙省新茶彙聞</h3>
<p>遂安毛茶價漲　浙省遂安淳安等綠茶、近日新貨上市、頗形湧旺、現因各路客帮雲集、銷路激增、毛茶售價已由六十元回漲至六十七八元、行情頗爲堅硬云、</p>
<p>湖州新茶已　秤　湖州新綠茶、今庚因天時寒冷、採摘遲緩、日來各山區毛茶、多有上市、昨據泗安消息、該路新茶已開秤、行情做開六十六元、銷路暢旺、人心均趨穩定、</p>
<h3>英茶商要求放兌開市</h3>
<p>自洋莊茶棧宜布停止匯兌後、日來各路新茶源源來滬、洋行家設有土莊茶廠者、業已積極製運出口、於其他洋行業務、影響甚大、昨經英茶商一度聚議之後、已由錦隆協和怡和三行、函請茶業公會、要求照原放匯開市云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵中砂白猛跌七角半</h3>
<p>昨搪市趨勢、依然疲弱、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨叫二十二元、轉口貨叫六元八角半、亦有叫六元八角者、均未成交、東赤原價乏受、東白四號現貨二十一元七角半、轉口六元七角半、均小五分、略有成交、八號現貨二十一元三角牛、轉口六元四角、九號現貨二十一元二角、轉口六元二角、比小五分至一角、本廠綿白如振記·大單·金心等均叫原價、無史動、號貸僅有潮　開出枝赤二十四包十二元、</p>
<p>糖業合組公司、昨屆標售之期、計粵　總定額爲六千七百四十八包、有順德廠五羊粗白六百四十二包、二十一元八角、曲溪廠又一百三十包、二十一元六角、價無更動、惟二號綿白二十元八角、四號又二十元六角、均跌二角半、未成、中砂白猛跌七角半、價爲十九元八角、亦僅成交二十包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新榨菜開價轉緊</h3>
<p>四川榨菜出新以來、因到貨仍少、而產價難小、成本均勗、以致迄無鬆象、反見步緊、連日　出陪陵菜二十二元半至二十三元、高樂磧菜廿五元五角、普通二十四元至二十三元半、成交六百塲之譜、至於銷方以本街內地較活動、客貨未開者僅三千餘雷壜、故一時絕無回鬆之望、</p>
<h3>雜項　三柰又升二元</h3>
<p>三　近以到貨無繼、而產價甚挺、划申難合、故此問號貨均堅守少出、昨聞零星稍有成交、比前父升二元、查存底確已稀薄、故開價雖高、趨勢甚挺云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （張鳳）</p>
<p>往昔專制時代，靑年們的婚姻全須出於父母之命，媒妁之言；是隸屬在家長獨裁制之下，正興當時的政體同軌。這雖不免要造就多少怨偶，一方面却讓靑年們多一些機會致力在學業的修進，可望其將來的事業得有更偉大的成就，好在他們可以心不旁騖。現在，戀愛自由通行着，婚姻跟蹤着靑年們的年齡的增進和生理的變化，立卽成爲他們剛纔入世的當前第一問題，要他們自爲解决了。要追求配偶，不得不先研究戀愛的智識和技巧；要婚事可靠，又不得不犧牲相當的考察的時光。這麽着，怨偶未必全蠲，但瞧離婚案件日增月盛，大好的靑春却從此溜瀉一般地輕易消失了悔不可追！再者，事實現見：一般入所謂「買賣式的婚姻」之間，除了少數自命維新而別存野心的男女外，倒有大部份的夫婦能得相安無事的。這斷不是偶然僥倖的事態。鼓吹戀愛自由和婚姻自主的一班熱心人，應請再思及此！</p>

<p>春卉中以海棠爲最嫵媚，含苞時幾如點點胭脂，行將施諸美人粉頰也，植諸牆隅石側，最爲有致，樹高尋丈，花有單瓣，有重瓣，分淡紅濃紅兩種，而長樂志云：「海棠色紅，以木瓜頭接之則色白」。又瑣碎錄云：「黃海棠本性類海棠，靑葉微圓而色深，光滑不相類，花半開鵝黃色，盛開漸淺黃矣。」洪适有黃海棠詩云：「漢宮嬌半額，雅淡稱花仙，天與溫柔態，妝成取次妍。」則又有白若黃之異殊可知。</p>
<p>錢塘陳思撰有海棠譜，有叙事，有詩，凡萬餘言，與王觀芍藥譜，歐陽修洛陽牡丹記媲美，均香國之名作也。</p>
<p>考之古法，海棠花欲鮮而盛，於冬至日早，以糟水澆農下，又海棠候花謝結子剪去，來年花盛而無葉。</p>
<p>海棠有柔枝長條，顏色淺紅垂英下向者，爲垂絲海棠。有堪作盆玩者，曰貼梗海棠，有高一二丈，枝密而條暢者，曰西府海棠。</p>
<p>海棠有艷史，外史檮杌云：「蜀潘炕有嬖妾解愁，姓趙氏，其母吞海棠花蕊而生，頗有國色，善爲新聲。」冷齋夜話云：「上皇登沉香亭，召太眞妃，於時卯醉未醒，命力士使侍兒扶掖而至，妃子醉韻殘妝，鬢亂釵橫，不能再拜，上皇笑曰：「豈妃子醉，是海棠睡未足耳。」</p>
<p>江左謂海棠爲川紅，吳中復詩云：「却恨韶華偏蜀土，更無顏色似川紅。」其名殊僻也。</p>

<h3>嘗試</h3>
<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>一天，我遇見洪深先生，他告訴我，最近給明星公司寫了一個劇本「新舊上海，」是一種嘗試，因爲這劇本裏，沒有主角，凡是演出者，都求其平均發展，使各盡其長。故事是沒有因果的，社會就是因事實的表現就是果。結果是非常散漫的，並且是非常錯綜的。這種寫法在個人固然是創作，恐怕在橫的方面，縱的方面，也很少見。</p>
<p>我知道這劇本給程步高先生導演的，我就去訪問步高先生，他說，這部影片，在他也是一種嘗試。在明星過去的作風，差不多是一貫的，儘有用着許多演員，演出一個極偉大的故事來，采取許多的塲面，攝成極複雜的機構來。但是在極單純的佈境裏，導演極廣大的社會反映，還是破天荒。這好像一個獨幕劇，而要包含多幕劇的質量，是何等困難呢？</p>
<p>我聽了他倆的話，便急於要一看他倆的作品了。在前天試演時，我就費了足足兩小時的功夫，去領略一回，覺得他倆的嘗試，都有相當的成就了。大槪一種滑稽劇，總是以逗人笑樂爲目的，可是看「新舊上海」以後，笑過了一陣，就有一點辛酸味的刺激。就文藝立塲而論，劇本的好處，全在對話的尖銳化。表現的好處，全在動作的幽默化。所以我對周劍雲先生說，這是你們的膽大處！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　品茗作淸談夜窗聽雨　折枝驚艷影花巷流芳</p>
<p>那清秀的面孔上，加着一副水晶眼鏡，兩隻炯炯有光的眼珠，在鏡子下藏着英銳之氣，便微笑了一笑、國器道：你打量了我許久，忽然微微一笑，這裏面很像是有點文章。平山將一隻脚連連的地板上敲打着，可是他那眼光，還是在國器身上打量着。國器笑道，爲什麽不說話，你對我的話，不大相信嗎，平山道：你看，你是這樣丯致翩翩的一個人，發表出來的文字，又總是些哀感頭艷的小說筆記之類，這都是富於兒女之情的表現。一個人有了兒女之情表現，能說他心裏沒有室家之念嗎？闕器笑道：這是你誤會了我的意思了。說了這樣一句話，他急切的想不出來下文，只好抬起兩手來，扶了一扶眼鏡架子，然後又站起來，把桌上那個維納絲像放到原處，又斟了一杯茶要喝。剛待拿起杯子來，却又把茶杯放下來，微微的一笑，平山笑道：國器兄，我看你這樣子，好像有什麽話要說，你何妨說出來？國器笑道：話是當然有話，只是要說出來，這話有一大長篇，未免囉唆了。我想着婚姻是人生大事，那對手方，若是有一點兒勉强，就不如無有。所以在我心裹，必定要那人像這個維納絲的像一樣，淸潔無塵，只看到表面，就讓我心裏起了一種欣慕。這一點欣慕之心，還要决不是慾念，决不是痴騃，决不是……她說到這裏，又把桌上的茶杯拿起來放到嘴邊，慢慢的呷，微微的帶了笑容，凝着神，想完成那一句話。平山笑道：你不用得說那下文，我已經明白了。就是要在純潔的愛情之下，作成一個新式而又完美的眷屬，把你的生活，沒養在……他說着，抬起手來，也是不住的抓耳爬腮。國器笑道：愛情是一種神秘的事情，决不能用言語去形容，言語形容得出來的愛情，那就是很平凡的事了。總而言之一句話，我自己知道我的目標懸得太高，在社會上不能找出我那理想中的人，唯其是不能找出我那理想中的人，我就乾脆作個獨身主義者完了。話談到這裏，已經是坐到夜深了，四週沒有人聲，却有那斜風捲着的雨絲，一陣陣的向天井裏的樹枝上竹校上，沙沙的撲舉着，屋子裏難是把窗戶全已關閉了，但是那窗子格扇縫裏，不斷的向裏面透着凉氣，彼此都感着有一種說不出來的情景。（一七）</p>

<h3>半小時訪問黃柳霜</h3>
<p>— 無私</p>
<p>在黃柳霜到杭州去遊覽的前夜，我在高可摩天百拜耳塔式的國際飯店，意外地邂逅着當天才跟胡蝶在一起遊玩的黃阿妹，不，應該改稱她爲「阿拉美黃」或「阿媚」小姐。我便在半小時內，和她作了一次長談。</p>
<p>我知道黃小姐聽不慣上海話，於是拉了一個會講廣東話的朋友，把我們先自己介紹一番，然後再和她問話，我問話的口吻和神氣，乾脆直爽得活像一個法官或偵探，自己聽來，也覺得有些不好意思。不過在交際塲中活動慣的黃女士，她倒也很坦白地回答我們，而且不管問題，是吾瑣屑或唐突，終是柔聲和氣地有問必答。這一夜的訪問，她的確給我們一個很好的印象，而目還供給我們許多關於她過去身世，和她從事電影工作成績的參考資料。後面所記的，都是根據她親口敍述的話。</p>
<h3>柳霜簽名</h3>
<p>我是廣東台山人，今年是三十歲，生在美國舊金山。父親名字呌做良稔，很早就在美國洛杉磯經商，開洗衣舖。我共有兄弟姊妹七人，都還沒有結婚。我是排行第二，有一個弟弟，現在上海敎書；一個妹妹，在海關中做事。我從十五歲起，卽開始拍電影。第一决和環球影片公司訂合同，在過去十多年中，先後和美國公司立合同的有米高梅，聯美，派拉蒙幾家，在歐洲則有英國的高蒙，德國的烏發，也都盯過合同。我拍過的片子，有「月宮寳盒」「鸚鵡」「上海快車」「朱金昭」及「爪哇頭」數種，但是自己都不很滿意。這一决回到祖國來，正想要多看一些中國實際的情形，希望能够和國內社會中的各界人士，允其是和中國家庭中的女人們，交際往來。同時要多多學習說中國話。因爲我年紀小的時候，祗念過四年的中國書，其餘二十多年，是常常說慣美國話。在美國的中國人却可以懂美國話，到了中國，單說廣東話也不夠，必須要能說普通國語才好。不久，大的是下個星期，我要到北平去過夏天的假期，或者會更多學習中國官話的機會。大的本年九月間，我仍舊要回到上海來，然後再到美國去。我以前在影片中所担任的角色，都不很重耍，我是服從導演的支配，常常扮做外國劇本中的中國女人，所扮飾的大槪都是婢女或是侍妾。以後我不願意再担任這種的角色。希望有人用英人編幾種描寫中國近代社會或家庭生活的影片劇本，供給美國公司拍攝影片。同時我也計劃把我在旅行中觀察所得，貢獻給美國的電影界作爲參考</p>
<p>說着一口流利外國話的黃柳霜，若使沒有黃的膚色，黑的髮髻，扁的鼻子，和杏仁般的眼睛，我眞不信她是一個中國的女人。</p>
<p>特寫之二</p>
<h3>第一勞働託兒所參觀記</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>一個勞働家庭，或職業婦女，一旦有了一個孩子，那的確會成爲問題的。因爲一個婦女生了孩子，就不得不擔負起相當的責任來，撫育他，敎養他；這在一般家庭婦女當然是份內的事，而在經濟相當富裕者也可僱用保姆或奶媽代領，這些是都不成問題的。可是那職業或勞工婦女，一方面爲了家庭經濟，伊們决不能放棄原有的工作或職業，僱用奶媽，事實上更不會允許，况且我國的工廠和商號，機關，還沒有和歐美各國一樣的爲女職員女工人特設個育兒房」或「哺乳室」；於是，在此情形下，伊們就有顧此失彼的困難了</p>
<p>現在，婦女走到社會上，和回進家庭去這問題，正有許多人在爭論着，但我以爲到家庭，到社會都沒有問題，反正家庭裹社會上都有伊們應該做的事情，然而首先要顧到的便是須使雙方有利無害。</p>
<p>昨天，我特地到南市蓬萊路近泮坊去參觀了一下本市兒童幸福會所創辦的第一勞働託兒所，覺得它是一個專門接受那些勞働家庭和職業婦女委託育兒的機關；可惜範圍太小，裏面的額子不多，所以不免使人有向隅之嘆。但是照當局的初心，也許想要第一第二第三甚至而第九第十的推廣開失的。不過至今却還沒有値第二勞働託兒所出現。</p>
<p>我推進門去向一個傭人說明了來意，便在會客室裏等着。在那裏，壁上除了兒童幸福會委員，吳鐵城，吳醒亞，潘公展，李廷安等諸氏的照相外，還有各種標語及規章。不一刻管理員張女士來領導我到各部去參觀，並且告訴了我所裏的一切設備情形。</p>
<p>這裏一共是六幢房屋，樓下是辦公處，檢騐室，會客室等。樓上，左首是嬰兒部，那裹共有嬰兒的三十人，每人一隻白色的小鐵床，所有衣服被褥等全係白色絨布所製，完全　人奶，每月收費十二元，一切應需及衣被均由所內負擔。這一部裏所收的嬰孩爲四個月至十多個月，每一個嬰孩規定十五個月為一期，期滿由家長領回，再收新孩。</p>
<p>右首是兒童部，裏面除了兒童臥室，運動室，餐室，浴室外，還有一個課堂。那兒也有三十來個孩子，他們兩歲到四歲，每月只收費兩元，衣服飲食都由所裏供給；但並不住宿所裏，每天上午七時由孩子的家長送來，至下午六時來領回去。至於生活方面，每天早上上課二小時，一日三餐，下午一時至三時必需午睡兩個鐘頭，隔天換一决衣服，每星期至少洗浴一决。</p>
<p>臥室是專給他們午睡用的，道裏依决排列着小鐵床三十多隻，每床上均有被褥，室內光綫保持着柔和。運動室裏陳列着各種玩意兒及運動具，那三十來個活潑潑的，天眞可愛的兒童就在室裏遊戲。</p>
<p>各部室裏都很淸潔整齊，充滿着一片和愛快樂的空氣。裏面旣聽不到什麽噪雜，也沒有一些哭聲。</p>
<p>所裏僱用年靑力壯的保姆及乳母十二人哺育和管理孩子，關於健康方面，每星期有特的醫生來所檢查各兒童的身體與口腔一决，有疾病的便送醫院去診治。</p>
<p>參觀後回來，我覺得這實在是値得提倡的一椿社會事業，希望大家加以愛護。</p>

<h3>炙治之科學的研究（上）</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>炙治爲吾國古代醫療方法之一種。盛行於民間。而無智老媼。允優爲之。謂爲無效。則流傳迄今。有時亦見奇效。謂爲有效。亦未必盡然。如此幾千年來習行之方法。均知其然而不知其所以然。茲從科學方面之觀察。以說明炙治之眞相如下。</p>
<p>（甲）炙治之歷史使皮膚發生火傷。以治療疾病。此方法之發源。恐起始於吾國之古代。但亦有人謂起始於印度者。則無確實之證明。日本民間亦盛行炙治。此則在紀元一二二二年。由吾國流傳過去。在日本織豐時代。亦有炙治書籍之著述。吾國關於此等著述。當屬不少。但大多爲手抄本。卽印刷者。亦因圖畫拙劣。多難傳眞。而手抄本允幾盡屬秘本。不肯流傳。吾國醫學之落後。此亦一大原因也。</p>
<p>（乙）炙治之定義所謂炙治者。卽用艾葉放在皮膚之一定地點（卽所謂經穴）上。燃以火。以治療疾病之意也。</p>
<p>（丙）炙時之燃燒溫度　使艾燃燒時。可以發生攝氏六百四十度之溫熱。但用艾柱放在家免之腹璧上燃燒時。平均爲六十一度至二百度。其達於皮下之溫度。如達二公分深時。可上昇二度內外。如達二公分三之深時。則上昇半度以下。</p>
<p>上述艾柱之燃燒。作用於皮膚之組織。使蛋白質惹起某程度之凝固。凝固後之蛋白質。漸决破壞而被吸收。發生一種之異種蛋白體之作用。</p>
<p>（丁）炙治對於身體各部之作用　　對於血液之影響在家兎炙後二分間內外。取其血液檢査之。則見白血球之增加。達三四％乃至二倍。此時增加者。多爲中性多核白血球。此白血球之增加。可繼續至施炙後四五日間。亦有人謂赤血球及血色素亦增加者。又其血液之凝固時間短縮。且有血糖增加。血球之沉降速度亦大。</p>
<p>又對家兎施炙後。卽採取其血液。分離其血淸。可以證明腎上腺素樣物質之增加。</p>
<p>對於血管之影響　施炙中血管先收縮。後反擴張。</p>
<p>對於脈搏之影饗　當艾燃燒時。脈搏數增加。火滅後至血管擴大時。脈搏尙多。</p>
<p>對於血壓之影響　在動物試騐。當炙時因痛覺刺戟之瞬間。血壓始上昇。刺戟去後。在短時間以內則下降復舊。其程度則因動物之種類及炙之大小而不一定。在人亦有血壓上昇者。的爲五－三二mm水銀柱。</p>
<p>對於呼吸之影響　呼吸數多增加。有時反滅少。亦有無影響者。</p>
<p>對於腸運動之影響　普通在施炙後。多使旺盛之腸運動鎭靜。此恐因支配腸之交感神經之刺戟及腎上腺素樣物質之作用。</p>
<p>對於膽汁分泌之作用　將家兎作一膽汁屢管。施炙時則見膽汁之分泌增加。然用「阿刀賓」Atropin使交感神經抑制後。則膽汁之分泌不增加。此其增加恐因交感神經機能亢進之故。</p>
<p>對於筋力及疲勞之影響　筋工作時。施以灸洽。其結果筋力强盛。其疲勞之恢復迅速。此恐由於腎上腺素產出增加之故。</p>
<p>對於腎臟之作用　從家兎實騐之。灸時無利尿作用。倘灸之程度加甚。殘留巨大瘢痕時。則發見蛋白尿。</p>
<h3>肺癆統計之世界觀（七）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>所謂二種統計者，卽結核死亡例之在三十歲以下者，德國全境，較之普羅士之統計爲低。自三十歲至七十歲之間，則二者幾乎相等。在七十歲以後，則普羅士之統計爲較低云。又在五歲以下之死亡例，不論在普羅士省及德國全境，在一九三〇年前均有遞减之現象。但在一九三一至一九三二年間，又有增加之傾向。而男子死亡例之在靑年工作時代者，亦已逐漸遞减。又在五歲至三十歲間婦女之死亡例，較高於男子。</p>
<p>下列表爲Moellers氏在兩性間各種不同年齡之結核死亡統計</p>
<p>第一歲　男性多於女性</p>
<p>第二歲至第十歲　男性等於女性</p>
<p>第十歲至二十歲靑春發育期　女性多於男性</p>
<p>二十至二十五歲　男性多於女性（一八八二至一九二二年）</p>
<p>女性多於男性（一九二三至一九二九年）</p>
<p>二十五至三十歲　男性多於女性（一八八二至一九零二年）</p>
<p>女性多於男性（一九一三年起）</p>
<p>下表爲德國各種不同年齡之兩性結核死亡統計（單位一萬居民）</p>
<p>Calmette氏之報告，凡在有結核環境之嬰兒，其結核死亡例為念四至八十％德國Lederer氏Retse氏則僅發現五，一至七，一％又奧國Goetzel。惟Frautz納亦有相似之數目，爲七％。惟Frautz氏則證明嬰兒之結核死亡例，其統計較高，乃爲十六，九％。由是而觀，嬰兒之在結核環境中之死亡例，平均而論，其統計不若從前預算上之高。</p>
<p>又在事實上，在結核環境中之嬰兒結核死亡例，並不因BCG免疫接種之後而行减少。惟關於此點，尙乏大規模之統計。若以柏林地方有結核傳染環境中之嬰兒死亡統計觀之，並不較他處爲高。在道率道夫地方，則有結核傳染之嬰兒，比較的反爲安全，其統計或且稍低云。就事實上而論，一方則因多數之診療所及保護所之組織個全所到，另一方面則此種死亡統計之减退，與婦女生育期間內之結核死亡例及婦女之生育例同時减少，亦有相當之關係焉。</p>
<p>又幼兒之結核死亡例，亦有同樣佳良之傾向，在Bonn地方，Frentzen氏曾在診療所中施行六歲以下幼童三九三例之Moro氏接種反應，內一百十例為陰性反應，其屬於陽性反應者為一百六十二例，但均無臨床的及X光綫上之病理變化發現。</p>
<p>又學齡兒童之死亡例，亦已漸漸下降，如Peretti，Kieffer，Stephan諾氏，均有同樣之證明。所須注意者，乃為女孩之新傳染，在學齡中較之男孩為多，此第一次結核傳染，在學齡期間，較之任何年齡爲最可忍受。以Braeuning氏之統計，僅有五％之學齡兒童，於每年間有結核之之傳染，而急性之結核，在學齡期間內者爲一，八％，開放性之結核，僅發現〇，一％。作大規模之檢騐者，有Peretti及Simon氏嘗在各地舉行之。Simon氏在亞倫堡地方之城市學校內，發現有三〇，三％，在鄉間之學校爲二二，六％，有陽性反應之結果。此種傳染之减退原因，一方由於學校設備之改進，一方則由於發現病態後，立卽使之隔離之所致。Peretti氏在一九二五年，證明有三〇，一％，在一九三二年僅有一二，五％之Moro氏方法之陽性反應。在脫離學校之生活以後，其統計在一九二七年爲五四，三％，在一九三三年爲四〇，四％。由是而觀，則結核之總傳染，並不在幼童年齡之最初期，而在較高之年齡。而結核之散布，不論在嬰兒時代，幼童時代，學齡時代，大部分之關係，均爲外來之原因，而兩親之經濟關係如何，更爲重要。</p>
<p>幼寫之結核死亡例，在一九三一年以前，稍有微微增高之傾向，但在最近數年內，其統計又行停留而低降矣。Langer氏在柏林之女皇維多利亞醫院之臨床統計，自一九二六年至一九三一年間亦證明幼兒結核患者之有增加。</p>
<p>學齡兒童，與開放性結核之敎師，其危險程度爲何如乎。G：ertbmuhlen氏之試騐結果，在一個開放性結核之女敎員，發現有三二％之土白可林陽性反應，在健康之敎員方面，僅有二一％，在他種試騐方法，亦發現有巨大之相差程度，爲七九，五與三八，七％之比例。</p>
<p>在英國之有結核傳染危險之嬰孩死亡例，亦比較的下降，此爲Cox之報吿，氏之此項觀察，正與德國相同，蓋與治療所看護所及營養諸問題，均有莫大之關係。氏又證明在第一至第二歲間之死亡例爲相等者，自第二歲至第五歲間之幼童之在結核環境中者，其死亡例有顯明的增高。陽性之土白可林反應，在有結核傳染環境中者，較多於無結核傳染環境中之幼兒，（Schlesinger）而傳染之最多數，在有傳染危險之環境中爲五年，在無結核之環境中爲十五年。又女孩之傳染，輒較男孩爲多。結核之父親，其傳染程度，亦較結核之母親爲高。</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（八十七）眼瞼膿痬，眼瞼　腫，及眼瞼痙攣症</p>
<p>眼瞼膿痬　眼瞼膿痬多由眼瞼皮膚損傷而起。或因眼窩骨膜炎及丹毒而續發。牠起始的時侯。卽在局部皮膚發生潮紅腫脹。皮下漸起硬結作痛。耳前淋巴腺亦常腫脹，有時且來發熱。如是經過不久。皮下浸潤部。卽能軟化成膿。此時若加切開。卽可排膿治愈。</p>
<p>眼瞼癤腫　眼瞼癤腫的原因。亦如普通癤腫一樣。也是由葡萄狀球菌的傳染而起。一般多發於眉毛部。最初祇生丘疹或膿庖。周圍皮膚發赤腫脹。不久硬結漸次增大。局部感痛。劇烈的時候。並有惡寒發熱。本症的治療法。卽先用消炎法。若呈膿點。卽當切開排膿。</p>
<p>眼臉痙攣症　眼臉痙攣症是由眼輪匝肌發痙攣性收縮而起。以致患者不隨意的將眼瞼閉鎖。牠的原因。可別爲二。</p>
<p>症候性眼臉痙攣症－在結膜囊內異物（譬如塵埃吹入眼內），睫毛亂生，角膜泡疹，角膜潰瘍，虹彩炎等時。常可刺戟二叉神經。引起一種反射的作用。而使眼輪匝肌發生痙攣。此時患者眼臉閉鎖。不易開張。眼淚頻流。以致醫師在診察的時候。開張眼瞼。常感困難。須用開瞼器。或滴减少刺戟的眼藥。始可達倒診察的目的。牠的治療方針。就是須治原病。方可冀愈。</p>
<p>特發性眼瞼痙學症－本症爲眼輪匝肌的原發性痙攣。多因歇司的里而發。所以本症又名歇司的里性眼瞼痙攣。在精神與奮的時侯。痙攣現象。特別强烈。再者發於老年人的一種眼瞼痙攣稱爲老人性眼瞼攣症。亦係特發性的一種。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（三一）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一四九問）　太冷太熱的食物，爲什麽不應該吃？</p>
<p>答　太冷太熟的食物　激刺力過强，牙髓易致受病，不宜常食。</p>
<p>（第一五〇問）　酸類食物，爲什麽有害牙齒？</p>
<p>答　過酸的食物如酸果和醋，能直接消蝕牙磁，不宜常吃，偶或吃時，吃後必須漱口。</p>
<p>（第一五一問）　糖類食物，確如普通人所想像的那般有害嗎？</p>
<p>答　糖爲炭水化物的一種，和米麥一樣，並不能直接損害牙齒，若說糖有害牙齒不宜食，那末，米麥也不宜食了！不過吃糖時，留在口內的殘餘，和飯麵等的殘屑一樣，極易發酵燮酸，變了酸就能溶蝕牙磁如果食得其時，在餐時和他物同吃，吃後刷牙，則糖類食物，並不能爲害的。但吃後不肯洗漱的人，不如少吃爲宜。</p>
<p>（第一五二問）　姙娠時期，飲食應該怎樣注意</p>
<p>答　姙娠時期，因身體內石灰質的消失，牙齒多易生蛀，此時應多食滋養之品。富有石灰質和丁種維他命之品，允爲相宜。</p>
<p>第五節　全身健康和其他的注意</p>
<p>（第一五三問）　全身不健康對於牙齒的影響怎樣？</p>
<p>答　健康衰退的人，大多榮養不良，新陳代謝，失却平衡，身體內酸素過多，牙齒的石灰質退化，抵抗力薄弱，唾液也往往失常，甚至變爲酸性，失却防護牙齒的功能，蛀牙和其他牙患就易發生，發生了牙患，愈能使身體衰弱，所以統計起來，到牙醫生求治牙患的人，身體不康健的居多。</p>
<p>（第一五四問）　鄉下入飲食粗劣而且不注意口腔衛生，爲什麽牙齒健全的很多？</p>
<p>答　鄉間農村的人，日出而作，日入而息，生活極其自然簡單，賊害健康的事很少，而且常能得日光和新鮮空氣，所以他們的身體，都比較的健康，少有疾病，因之牙齒的抵抗力也比較的强，不易蛀壞。很多野蠻民族，和古代人民的齒牙，很爲完好，也是因爲身體健康的綠故。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八九）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>本病患者的咯痰係如何的處置呢？其唯一之目的，自非滅絕痰中之結核菌莫屬了！上面已經述過，結核菌的抵抗力很强，係極不容易死滅的，故在詳述滅絕方法種種之先，先要曉得他的抵抗力之眞正狀况。他（結核菌）對於乾燥，腐敗作用，寒冷，三者抵抗力之强，都很足驚人的。在尋常乾燥的地方，痰中的結核菌生命可延至九個月以上；其間日光之照射與吾，以及痰層之厚薄，當然是微有差別的。大慨厚塊之痰較薄層者生命爲久長，無日光照射處較有日光亦如之，在全暗之室隅而成厚塊者爲最久。第二：對於腐敗作用的抵抗力，係比較前者差多了，但至少也要好幾天方能死滅的。第三：對於寒冷一層，細菌們大都係毫不闢痛癢的；甚至反爲保存生活之最良條件，和人類之不耐寒冷而凍死完全兩樣的。結核菌自不外此例。他在冰點以下十度中，雖經六星期之久，其傳染力係毫無變化的。此外，還有一事須連帶聲明者，有許多人們，取病者的咯痰衣服等埋於土中，以謂結核菌定可因之而死滅，這是完全錯誤的。因爲在土裏面一無日光之照射，又無空氣，自難起腐敗作用；對於他們，反成生活上最備之良好條件。據專家的報吿，在埋於土內二年以上之本病患者肺部中，尙可發見生存之結核菌的，我們也可以因之而見一斑了！</p>
<p>結核菌如何方能死滅呢？在現今醫學上所採用的方法，大致不外　消毒殺菌劑；　加熱；　利用日光三種。這方面的詳情，現在且分述於下面：</p>
<p>消毒殺菌劑　石炭酸係最普遍的殺菌劑，但如果和含有結核菌的痰相混合，需要的時間也很長，大慨百分之五的石炭酸水，至少需二十四小時以上，結核菌方能死亡的。純酒精也是差不多的；但酒精量非在痰量十倍以上則無効。濃厚的昇汞水需時比較短些，但其作用難達於痰之中心，故許多人不主張採用。Alkalysol爲克來沙爾製劑之一，近來很被許多人採用的，大慨百分之五的溶液，在尋常溫度，需時約四小時；如至八十度（攝氏）高熱，僅需半小時；洗滌則百分之二成分已夠。Gb.Bacillol亦為克來沙爾製劑之一，其功用與前者大致相同，用量亦爲百分之五溶液。Chloramin因無臭氣味，亦爲人們所樂用，用量的百分之十尖　，需時的六小時，如用以揩拭地板（病者房室內），則百分之一已足够了。如爲附着於手指或衣服之痰液，可用千倍之昇汞汞或百分之五石炭酸液洗滌該部，結核菌大都卽能死滅。對於有細菌附着嫌疑之手指，祇須用水及肥皂，决以消毒溶液群加洗滌，卽可達到消毒之目的；這是很簡易的方法，凡送者及每日接近病人者，均可隨時隨地施行的。</p>

<h3>銀行貸欵問題</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>立院則委長馬寅初對於復興農村方案之意見，內有請到銀行貸欵云：「市土一般主張，銀行貸欵减低利息，應由中央銀行對市面經濟說法考慮。惟銀行貸欵利息减低。則存人欵項利息之减低；亦爲同時發生之問題。現外國在華所設之銀行提高存欵利息至六七釐，如本國銀行減低存欵利息，則資本有流入外商銀行之慮，此應詳密考慮。」</p>
<p>中國的金融業是建築在公債地產等等的投機事業之上的，而不是建築在產業的發展之上的，就是說：不是把產業作爲牠的基礎。這，只要從銀行貸欵上面也可以看得出來了。「銀行貸欵利息减低，則存入欵項利息之减低，亦爲同時發生之問題。」然而銀行存欵利息的增高，那末銀行放欵的利息當然也就隨之而增高了。放欵利息一增高，差不多的工商業者就無法向銀行借欵，而銀行也因半殖民的中國的工商業在這整個世界經濟不景氣的氛圍中，也對於工商業有點兒放心不下，因此兩者之間，卽中國金融資本和工商業是疏遠了開來。</p>
<p>中國金融資本和工商業尙且如此疏遠，那末，中國金融資本會和破產得不堪的農村里廣大的貧農羣衆密切結合起來的嗎？銀行存入欺項的利息旣不可减低，而銀行放欵的利息當然是也不肯减低下去的，那末廣大的貧農羣衆還是無法貸欵。而卽使貸了欵，到將來或許就會陷入更深的債坑子里去而不能自拔出來，到那時候的那種慘象，只要使人一閉雙眼就可以看得到的了。所謂「復與農村」者云何呀？</p>
<p>問題是在這里：「現外國銀行提高存欵利息至六七釐，如本國銀行減低存欵利息，則資本有流入外商銀行之慮。」國際金融資本本來是處處扳我們中國金融資本的脚的。你要動一動手或脚，甚至瞬動一瞬動眼珠子，是都會引起他</p>
<p>我們如果要使中國的金融資本在這破產的農村中施以一點甘霖，或甚至好好地跟我們的工商業配合起來，最根本的總得先要把那扳脚者去掉才好！</p>
<h3>五月</h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>溫克特底熱血在他底乾枯的血管里泛流着了。他似乎聽見了一陣人們咆吼的巨流，在汎濫着支加哥城的每個空隙；他似乎看見整千整萬入們粗黑的拳頭在他底眼前幌動。然而當地下室的歌聲突的停止時，他禁不住吃驚地張頭四望，他底幻想消失了，人羣，咆吼，都在靜穆和黑暗的旋流里消失了。他這時，覺得有點焦燥，好像有一把火熖在他底心里燃燒，他底鼻孔因了幻覺作用，他吸到一股濃冽的酒精氣息。它貪婪的，有力的吸引着他。他伸出手在破外套的袋子里摸索着，他摸到了兩個光滑的，價値五十仙的銀幣，那是他和他一家底三天麵包的。然而他沒有來得及想它，便提起堅决的步伐推着地下室門進去。</p>
<p>地下室，這時已黑　　的充滿了人，一羣粗黑的骯髒的人！他們有半醉的，也有全醉的，有年靑的，也有老邁的，有男子也有女人。這是一羣不幸的，被生活壓榨着的人們。他們揚着粗黑的拳頭，大聲地爲着自己底不幸而咆吼。</p>
<p>「弟兄們！羅斯福總統的經濟復興法，曾給過了大家什麽禮物呢？三千萬人的巨大失業！」一個小伙子，用拳頭擊着桌，怒憤的吼着。</p>
<p>「而我已經失業足足有了兩年了！」一個衰老的小老人，用一種痛楚而又病弱的聲音嘆息着。</p>
<p>「喝吧！弟兄們，用力的喝吧！」</p>
<p>「來！這是我們最後的一盃了！」</p>
<p>溫克特跑到櫃台上要了一瓶强冽的麥酒，便偸偸的跑到一個陰晤的角落里喝起來。强冽的酒精底刺激，沒給他多少的等待，他底頭顱便沉重了起來，他底兩雙乾癟的眼睛，也因此而溢滿充血的火焰。</p>
<p>夜，帶着黑的翅膀溜走了。這是到了他底酒盃剩了最後一滴的時候了，他朦矓着，他感到世界是在燃燒了。可是有一種思想，一種可怕的駭異攫住了他，當他伸手去袋子里摸索着時，他發現了他已做出了一種天大的罪惡了，他喝去了他底妻和孩子們底麵包了。他們在飢餓着，呌號着，等待他底歸去，等待他那光滑的，可愛的兩個五十仙銀幣；然而他把它喝光了。他想若，他輕輕的戰慄起來了。他底耳朶被什麼塞住也似的，他聽不到什麽聲息；他底眼睛被什麽朦住也似的，他看不見一切，有的祇是妻底兇狠的面孔，粗野的呌駡，孩子們的哭泣和呼飢底微弱的哀鳴。……</p>
<p>他悽然地從坐位上站立起來，呆住了，手中擎着底盃兒也不自然的掉落在地，尖聲的響着，破碎了。</p>
<h3>封門</h3>
<p>— 陳跡</p>
<p>當早晨的微光透出暗淡的雲層，偸偸地爬進了阿根嫂嫂那狹窄混濁的小房間里的時候，阿根嫂嫂的心頭兒差不多要從胸膛里蹦跳出來似地，她不覺失聲地喊呌了出來。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「啊！十五號啦！……」</p>
<p>她整個身體像被人拋進在火堆里，熱病似地苦痛着，她想到了她的丈夫。</p>
<p>他有一年多沒事情做，只是閒蕩在家里，不是跟她吵架，就是打他的六歲的孩子毛毛。把家里什麽東西都當光啦！一天一天在飢餓，凍餒，焦燥，煩惱中過活下去。</p>
<p>他們負了債，他們是「二房東」，把「三房客」的房租收來了暫時自己用來塡飽肚子，這樣，房租空下來有足足八個月了。</p>
<p>「賬房先生：謝謝你，帮帮忙，我快要有生意啦！我會付淸的。……」</p>
<p>阿根用着非常卑賤的哀懇話，賬房先生在一陣忍耐的憤怒中去了。他們不敢再把從三房客那兒收來的房租塡用了，他們向可能借的地方去借，借，借，……然而房租還是拖欠了八個月。</p>
<p>「啊！這是天助佑了我們了吧。」當阿根嫂嫂聽阿根那非常高興的說：「漢口有信來了，那邊香烟廠里有一脚生意啦！」她的頭仰着天，在她的心里陡地起了一陣宗敎的濃烈的感情。</p>
<p>設法借得了路費，阿根，帶着滿懐的希望動身了。他曾對他的老婆說：「好好照顧孩子，那邊做的好，我會來接你們一起去住在那里的。」阿根嫂嫂流着歡喜的眼淚送走了她的丈夫。</p>
<p>可是一個月，兩個月，……阿根寄來的錢仍不飽她跟孩子們的肚皮，房租還是拖欠着八個月。阿根信里還未吿訴她：「廠里生意非常淸，不要說夜工了，就是日工，一禮拜有時只做得兩天哩……」可是賬房先生是不知道這苦衷的，他帶着保鏢的來，說得那麽憤怒地：</p>
<p>「現在你的男人有了生意啦！十五號不付三個月，，要封門啦！法院不是老早就判定了嗎？因為我看你男人沒生意，才跟你們馬馬虎虎！」</p>
<p>阿根嫂嫂急得什麽似地，連忙寫信去阿根那里，可是接到阿根的回信：說是跟帳房先生商量商量，生意一好，凖付三個月。……</p>
<p>阿根嫂嫂帶領了她的兩個兒子，親自跑到賬房先生那兒去懇商，可是得到的回答：還是那麽幾句聲色俱厲的話。</p>
<p>可是今天是十五號啦！阿根嫂嫂鳴嗚地哭泣看。一個六歲的跟一個三歲的那兩個孩子，輕微的鼾聲正跟着他們媽媽的哭泣聲合奏着：早晨的空氣是多凄切呵！</p>
<p>十五號把陽光照滿了大地，孩子們拖着阿根嫂嫂要早飯吃，可是她茫然若失地，只楞着兩隻哭紅了的眼珠子向他們看着。</p>
<p>房客們呌阿根嫂嫂搬掉點家具，可是她什麽都不動，只是像瘋了似地，她的胸脯急促地起伏着她呆呆地望着環繞着她的人們。</p>
<p>最後帶來她的惡運終於到了。賬房先生衝了進來似地，後面跟進來個法警，看門的拿着木板，銀頭，賬房先生厲聲呌道：</p>
<p>「房租怎樣？」</p>
<p>「帮帮忙好……」</p>
<p>「封門！封門！」</p>
<p>法警把阿根嫂嫂拖了出去。看門的把木板交錯地釘在大門上，她的房間同時也封了。房客們是限三天搬掉。這時，阿根嫂嫂像醒悟過來一般地，坐在弄堂里，呌天喊地的哭號着，兩個孩子也在她的身邊哭呌着：</p>
<p>「媽呀！媽呀！……」</p>
<p>大羣的人們環繞着她，像是同情她，又像是來看熱鬧。</p>
<h3>風塵</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>早晨，在那個囂攘嘈雜的小茶館門口，我又遇見那位古怪的「陸先生」了；這一回，不再是無聊地帶着愁容在街頭徬徨，或用像要哭的聲調來提到他那「八十多歲的老娘」了——這一回，他是若有其事的，彷彿是很忽忙的，像是在期待着一些什麽似的站在那小茶館門口探望。看見我，祇是吃驚地勉强點一點頭，便旋過身去，若無其事地看着街上的來來往往的車輛與人了。</p>
<p>我打量着那位一向被我喚作「陸先生」的中年人：我覺得，誠如他自己以前說過的，「我終於有一天會從生活的高塔上跌下來的」，而今，也許他眞的從「生括的高塔上跌落下來了。他穿了比以前更襤褸的短衣，他有了比以前更枯萎的形容：「總之，日子是一天不如一天了……」</p>
<p>然而，生活的高塔是峻險的，誰也不能担保不會有跌翻的一天呀！是的，那位古怪的「陸先生」，我是瞧着他一天天地從生活上跌落下來，我也瞧見了他底對於生活的「企圖」的，可是，「人終於會那麽很快地完結了的」啊……</p>
<p>認識「陸先生」是在一所房子的亭子間裏，爲了同住在一所房子裏，爲了每天早晚都見面，這樣，開始是互相不在意地點一點頭以後便招呼起來，笑一笑，講幾句通常的閒話；這樣，就很奇怪的算是「認識」起來了……</p>
<p>誰都覺得這位瘦長的，含糊的「陸先生」有一點兒古怪。據說是在一家小學校裏敎書的，拿十二塊錢的薪水，每天連夜課敎上七八個鐘頭的課，而就用了這三個月發一次（！）的十二塊錢維持着自己以外的三個人的生命：一個八十多歲的娘和二個汚豬一般的孩子……</p>
<p>從來沒有聽到他提起過孩子的母親，也從來沒有人向他問起過「陸師母」，祗有一個夏天的晚上，十個銅子的燒酒灌木了他底神經，才憤懣地罵起了他底女人來，說是「瞧不起窮措大的男人，丢下二個孩子，跑到闊少爺那裏做小去了，不要臉的，這世界，這世界……」</p>
<p>可是第二天醒來，他也就像已經把一切的事節忘掉了似的，不再提起。而人家也不再有那種閒情來問起他所不願說的事情了……</p>
<p>這樣，一天天的，陸先生生活在無盡的失意中，生活在憂念中。深夜獨兒個低低地在預備一點明天的夜課，把「秋水軒尺牘」裏的句子一遍遍地搖頭擺尾地吟讀，又從一部他所僅有的破舊的「辭源」上査着他所不知道的「古典」；可是，在學校裏欠了四個月的薪水之後，連那部破舊的「辭源」，也以三毛大洋的代價，給賈到舊書攤子上去了……</p>
<p>於是，陸先生他們「一家」，也爲了拖欠了好幾個月的房錢，給趕走了。走的時候，他像覺悟了一些什麽似地，變態地說：「生活，本來是一條悠長峻險的路，走着走着，入便變得滿面風塵了——祇要有什麽束西能把生活弄好起來的，我卽使是做强盜也幹……人是必需做生活的奴隸的啊。」</p>
<p>我以爲也許「陸先生」會瘋了，可是他却並沒有瘋，因爲，以後，我便一次决地在街角的那所小茶館門口遇見他，他已經改了一付樣子，也許，他是眞的在「把生活弄好起來了」……</p>
<p>眞的！到第三個月我走過那家小茶館門口的時候，有人吿訴我，說陸先生幹了一椿不明不白的勾當，給抓去吃官司去了。</p>
<p>我明白了，也許這就是他底對生活的「努力」吧？然而，無諭怎樣，我是懂得他的，在生活道路上，他眞的是一個僕僕風塵的勞苦的過客。</p>
<h3>養鳥的故事</h3>
<p>— 期全</p>
<p>大哥重復回到家庭之後，他完全變了一個人，從前那種剛毅，勇敢，前進的精神，現在幾乎搜不出一點遺留着的痕跡了；相反地他焚香唸佛，彷彿一個修修後世的老佛婆一樣。父親曾幾决抓住仙偶然興奮的機會想探聽他幾年在外流浪的悄形，但是父親一提到這件事情時，他馬上銷沉了，那一雙多血絲的眼睛默默地停往在一付戒殺生多修福的聯對上：那聯對也是他特地懸掛在客應裏的。這樣，過了一些時，他就悄悄地溜出客聽後，家裏人祇有想他高興的事做沒有敢再問起那些事的。那時候，家裏新僱佣一個廚子，他喜歡養鴿子。有一個夏天的晚上，大家在院子裏納凉，廚子無意中談着養鴿子的經騐，大哥就和他談上了。每天飯後跟着廚子上下等茶館，搜買鴿子。父親見大哥高興，也鼓起老興在院裏的一角裏造了個鴿棚，有時也上茶館去，帮着大哥提鴿籠，或者跑到幾里外的郊野去放鴿。那時鴿子在家裏是無上的賓客，掃棚，孵化那些工作是託付於廚子的，特別咐囑候人留意貓狗等走近鴿棚去侵害他們的安寗。我</p>

<p>們父子三個每天仿佛當做一件工作似的在院前坐地，看着那白色的動物在半空中飛翔，看着他們親熱地在屋角上私語，看着他們在棚裏扶養他們的子女。起初是大哥高興養鴿，大家跟着他做，後來和每個人都發生了興趣，沒有半年光景，在鄉里我們是鴿子最多的一個鴿棚了。</p>
<p>由於那小動物的興趣，大哥漸漸地恢復從前的態度了，所不同的是他變成了一個活潑，近乎頑皮的大孩子。從養鴿子的興趣擴大到養各種鳥類了。而那廚子呢，對於養烏都有點經騐，祇耍大哥想到一種什麽爲，他就能滔滔講述那種鳥的捕捉法，怎樣豢養，什麽形狀的是上品，雖然他有許多信口開河的地方，不過父親在希望得大哥的歡心，大哥離家的幾年中，他幾乎每年沒有歡笑的時侯。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Constitution Draft of the Republic of China Promulgated by National Government; Legislative Yuan's Process of Drafting the Constitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government promulgated the constitution draft on the 5th. The original order stated: "The draft constitution of the Republic of China has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. It is hereby promulgated." This order, (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft constitution of the Republic of China was officially announced to the people by the National Government on the 5th. It is generally agreed that the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee in April of the 20th year called for the Legislative Yuan to draft a constitution as soon as possible for the people to study.</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee Formed in January of the 22nd Year</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan immediately complied with the order and established a constitution drafting committee in January of the 22nd year. The President of the Yuan, Sun Ke, served concurrently as the chairman, with committee members Zhang Zhiben and Wu Jingxiong as vice-chairmen. Forty legislators were also appointed to carry out the work, with two months as the period for preliminary research, six months for drafting the first draft, and three months for discussing the draft. After 24 meetings, the first draft was completed and published to solicit opinions from all parties. By February of the 23rd year, the constitution drafting committee concluded its work.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan General Assembly Passes Seven Resolutions and Submits to the Central Government</h3>
<p>After the publication of the first draft, many opinions were received. President Sun Ke appointed 36 committee members, including Fu Bingchang, as review committee members. They first sorted out the opinions from all parties, holding eight preliminary review meetings and nine plenary review meetings, and revised and passed the first draft. In September of that year, it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan General Assembly for discussion. Seven general assembly resolutions were passed, completing three readings, totaling twelve chapters, six sections, and one hundred and seventy-eight articles. In October of the 23rd year, it was reported to the National Government and forwarded to the Central Political Council.</p>
<h3>Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee Submits for Review by the Standing Committee</h3>
<p>On December 14th of that year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee made the following resolution regarding the constitution draft passed by the Legislative Yuan: "The constitution draft of the Republic of China should adhere to the Three Principles of the People of the Premier to establish a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people. At the same time, it should consider the current environment and dangers facing the Chinese nation, and take into account practical political experience to create a system that is flexible and can concentrate national power. This draft should be submitted to the Standing Committee for careful review according to these principles."</p>
<h3>Central Government Decides on Principles; Legislative Yuan Revises Again</h3>
<p>In October of the 24th year, the Central Standing Committee finally completed its review of the constitution draft and decided on the following five principles: " To respect the historical foundation of the revolution, the Three Principles of the People, the Outline for National Reconstruction, and the spirit of law during the period of political tutelage should be the basis of the constitution draft. The organization of the government should take into account practical political experience to create a system that is flexible and can concentrate national power. Restrictions on the exercise of executive power should not be rigidly defined. The central government and local systems should be broadly defined in the constitution draft in terms of their powers, and their organization should be determined by law. For provisions in the constitution draft that must be stipulated but cannot be implemented immediately in fact, or cannot be implemented simultaneously throughout the country, the implementation procedures should be determined by law. The clauses of the constitution should not be numerous, and the wording should be concise." The Legislative Yuan was instructed to revise it again. After receiving the order, the Legislative Yuan followed the principles decided by the Central Government and passed the revision after three readings at the Yuan meeting on October 25th of that year, totaling eight chapters, nine sections, and one hundred and fifty articles, and submitted it to the National Government for forwarding to the Central Government.</p>
<h3>Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee Reviews the First Draft Again</h3>
<p>In November of the 24th year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee reviewed the revised draft constitution from the Legislative Yuan again and made the following decision: "This meeting believes that the recently revised constitution draft of the Legislative Yuan is generally appropriate. However, in order to adapt to the current situation of the country and facilitate implementation, there should be a sufficient period for detailed study. However, the National Congress is approaching, and the session of the Congress is very short, so there may not be time to discuss each article in detail for the final decision. For this reason, this constitution draft should be directly submitted to the Fifth National Congress, requesting that the date of the National Congress be decided first, and that the draft be broadly reviewed and guidelines be given. Then, the next Central Executive Committee should be authorized to conduct a more in-depth discussion over a longer period of time, and then submit it to the National Congress for deliberation and promulgation."</p>
<h3>Date of Announcement Decided and Review Committee Formed</h3>
<p>The Fifth National Congress accepted the constitution draft and authorized the Fifth Central Executive Committee to decide on the date of announcing the constitution draft and convening the National Congress, but it must be implemented within the 25th year. The First Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee made the following resolutions: The constitution draft will be announced on May 5th of the 25th year of the Republic of China, and the National Congress will be convened on November 12th. The election of the National Congress should be completed before October 10th. A constitution draft review committee will be established to be responsible for reviewing the draft and the proposals deemed appropriate for adoption by the Congress, and to draft amendments within two months, which will be submitted to the Standing Committee for forwarding to the Legislative Yuan for further revision of the articles. Ye Chucang, Li Wenfan, and 17 others were appointed as members of the review committee. The Central Constitution Draft Review Committee held many meetings and consulted various parties. The review was completed on the 18th of last month, and a review report was drafted, listing 23 key points of revision, and submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. The Central Standing Committee resolved to pass it on the 23rd of last month and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for revision of the articles.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Completes Revision of Articles and Finally Promulgates</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan completed the revision of the amended articles on May 1st, and submitted them to the Yuan meeting for three readings, revision, and passage, totaling eight chapters and one hundred and forty-eight articles, and submitted them to the National Government for formal announcement today (the 5th). Recalling the drafting of the constitution draft to this day, it has taken two years, with no fewer than one hundred meetings. All parties in the Central Government and the Legislative Yuan, during the discussions at the previous meetings, repeatedly researched legal principles and facts, and spared no effort to be thorough. Each meeting debated for several hours, and constitutions of various countries were translated as references. Their loyalty to the country and the strictness of the legislation are deeply admirable as we enter today, the day of the announcement of the constitution draft.

<h3>Nagata Visited Xiao Zhenying Yesterday - In-depth Discussion of the Hebei-Chahar Issue -</h3>
<p>Hada's Return to Japan May Mark the End of a Stage</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Will Announce Determination to Prevent Communism</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 10:00 AM on the 4th, Nagata, accompanied by Staff Officer Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi, visited Mayor Xiao at the Municipal Government to discuss the Hebei-Chahar issue, and left at noon. The authorities insist on the unchanged principle of resolving the Hebei-Chahar issue. Matsumuro will still come to Tianjin for consultation in the coming days. Song Zheyuan is very willing to take this opportunity to continue talks with the Japanese side in Tianjin due to his mother's illness. Diplomatic negotiations may come to an end before Hada leaves China. As a result of the Sino-Japanese meeting on the 4th, Nagata and Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi agreed to immediately report to Hada and respond on the 5th or 6th. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to relevant sources, there is no change in the situation in Chahar. The issue has not been discussed recently. The rumors about De Wang's puppet organization are mostly unfounded and far from the current period. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Junqing, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Chahar Garrison Headquarters Adjutant's Office, and Zhang Lingyun, Commander of the 29th Army Cavalry Brigade, were summoned to Tianjin by Song on the night of the 3rd to discuss the military defense against communism in western Hebei. They returned to their posts on the 4th to make arrangements. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The abolition of the Hebei-Chahar puppet organization. The last point of the Japanese side is that personnel can still be accommodated, but they must make the same factual representation externally as an exchange condition. This is the core of the dispute a few days ago, but the authorities are determined not to do anything to drive away the wolf and usher in the tiger. Regarding the Japanese protest against the construction rights of the Cangshi Railway, Xiao and Chen have verbally replied to the Tianjin military separately. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After repeated exchanges of views between Song et al. and Nagata and Matsumuro on Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, they have generally reached a consensus, but there are still some points that need to be studied and will be discussed further in Beiping. The key to the current diplomatic issue is internal, not external. If the Jin campaign against the bandits is more moderate than before, others will have no excuse diplomatically, and negotiations will be easier to progress. The armies of Hebei and Chahar provinces are sufficient and the anti-communist arrangements are quite thorough. It is determined that the communists will not easily disturb the borders of the two provinces. Regarding the prevention of communism, the Hebei-Chahar authorities have long been determined. After Song returns to Beiping, he will issue a telegram announcing his determination to thoroughly prevent communism and his firm will to oppose the communist party. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese special agent Matsumuro returned to Beiping from Tianjin last night and told reporters that he had met with Song Zheyuan twice, but the negotiations had not made much progress. He will continue to discuss it after Song returns to Beiping. However, according to reliable Chinese sources, a concrete decision has been made in Tianjin, but the content will not be disclosed until it is officially announced by both parties. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In order to unify diplomatic power, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council ordered the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic commissioner to be under the control and supervision of the Foreign Affairs Commission. Luo Jiaheng will take office within days. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>Soon to Take Office as Ambassador to China</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9:00 AM on the 4th, Kawagoe and his family boarded a special carriage on the Beining Railway to return to Japan.

I will remove all evil thoughts and move forward openly and justly." (Dentsu dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Armed Smuggling Negotiations in North China</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Armed anti-smuggling in North China involves diplomacy. Song Zheyuan instructed Xiao Zhenying to assist Tianjin Customs Superintendent Lin Shize and Chief Tax Commissioner Xu Liya in negotiating with the Japanese. Negotiations are underway. Due to rampant smuggling in North China, the combined revenue of Tianjin-Qinhuangdao, Zhifu, and Longkou in March was 25,328,000 yuan, a decrease of 13,275,000 yuan compared to last year. The decrease in Tianjin Customs alone is shocking. In March of last year, it received 20,789,000 yuan, but in March of this year, it only received 10,908,000 yuan, an average loss of 49% for the four ports. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>

People feel quite uneasy. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi and Shaanxi Authorities Issue General Offensive Orders Against Communists - Zhang Xueliang Arrives in Bingzhou to Discuss and Decide - Large Forces Gather from All Directions to Advance - Simultaneous Suppression Launched from All Sides</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Has Already Occurred at the Front</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Zhang Xueliang came to Bingzhou a few days ago and discussed with Yan and Chen to quickly launch a general offensive so that the bandits would not be able to defend and could directly attack the bandit's lair and destroy them all. In recent days, all parties have actively gathered large forces to advance into the bandit area. Starting from the 3rd, the authorities of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces issued general offensive orders against the bandits, launching simultaneous suppression from all sides. The Xu Lin bandit group in Xixian County, because our army had broken through the fortifications built by the bandits, the bandits successively fled west across the river. They are now being suppressed by large forces on both sides of the Xiang River. After Liu Zidan's death, the remnants are extremely chaotic and are trying to flee across the river between Yonghe and Daning. According to captured bandits, Liu's department was originally the pseudo-28th Army and has now been renamed the pseudo-1st Division, with fewer than a thousand soldiers. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) After our army issued general offensive orders, fierce fighting has occurred at the front in the past two days.

The armies of southern and eastern Shanxi have all been gathered at the front to pursue and suppress them. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Ju Zheng's Inspection Opinions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the memorial week on the morning of the 4th, Ju Zheng reported the following main points: "If we want to shoulder the important task of saving the country from difficulties, we must first strengthen our strength. Speaking of the strength of our party, we often look at the quantity and quality of party members. The number of party members in our party has increased year by year, almost increasing to thirty times, and its development seems gratifying. However, the distribution of party members is still not proportional to the population density in various places. Speaking of quality, our country is an agricultural country, and we should pay attention to farmers and workers, so that the majority are members of our party, but the current situation is not as we expected. In the future, to increase the strength of our party, we should pay special attention to the distribution of quantity and the enrichment of quality, so that we can shoulder the important task of saving the country." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin's Main Points of the Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin spoke on "The Fundamental Guidelines for National Construction" at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 4th. He first said that today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. When we recall the youth movement of that year, its purpose was to promote civil rights and uphold national sovereignty. Tomorrow, May 5th, is the first day of constitutional government, the day of announcing the draft constitution. This is to adapt to our intention to raise civil rights on the one hand and to have everyone work together for national construction on the other hand. It is decided that the first article of the Outline of National Reconstruction, personally drafted by the Premier, is a fundamental guideline for our national construction. Generally speaking, after a country undergoes a revolution and destruction, it must also have extraordinary construction following behind. If there is no such construction, the revolution will be meaningless. Construction work is much more difficult than destruction work, because construction work requires the concerted cooperation of the whole country, from top to bottom, and also requires various conditions to be completed. Since construction work is so difficult, if there is no plan to sort things out and implement them step by step beforehand, it will inevitably be more work than achievement. The Premier recently saw this point clearly, so when carrying out revolutionary destruction, he also prepared a construction plan to be followed and implemented, and the Outline of National Reconstruction is a large network of plans, which stipulates the guidelines for national construction, the goals of national construction, and the procedures for national construction. This is the crystallization of the Premier's thoughts and the grand plan for the long-term stability of the country. The Premier observed the trends of the world, assessed the national conditions of the country, and used his unique insights to stipulate that the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should be the fundamental guidelines for national construction. Originally, the meaning of the Three Principles of the People is to make all inequalities equal, and to achieve shared ownership, shared governance, and shared enjoyment from the domestic people, by the people, for the people to the global shared ownership, shared governance, and shared enjoyment. In other words, it is to take saving the country as a starting point and the Great Harmony of the world as a goal. As for the Five-Power Constitution, it was originally a perfect masterpiece created by the Premier by collecting the essence of China and foreign countries. Only a government created according to the Five-Power Constitution can be considered the most perfect government in the world. Since the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution have this kind of special characteristics, to build the Republic of China, we must proceed according to this guideline. The country created in this way will enable the people to obtain true equality, and after our country becomes strong, it will not invade others again. Not only will it not invade others, but according to the characteristics of the Three Principles of the People, it will inevitably make all mankind equal and realize the Great Harmony of the world. Therefore, the principle of the Three Principles of the People, the first step is to save the country, and when promoted, it is also a peace doctrine to save the world, which has great happiness for mankind. If we can realize it step by step, its profundity and breadth are beyond the reach of other doctrines." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>General Assembly of the Mongolian Political Council Decides on Future Policies for Mongolian Autonomous Administration</h3>
<p>Requests Central Government to Increase Funding and Issue Firearms</p>
<p>Prince Suo Absent; Prince De Presides Over Everything</p>
<p>(Bailingmiao telegram) Mongolian Political Council Chairman Prince Suo was unable to attend this decision meeting due to illness. In addition to sending a representative, he also telegraphed Vice Chairman Prince De to preside over everything. The council is holding a formal general assembly to discuss and decide: 1. Request the central government to increase funding for the Mongolian Council to develop its affairs. 2. Request the central government to issue firearms to expand the security team. It also decided on future policies for Mongolian autonomous administration. Japanese representative Nakajima did not attend the meeting. The Mongolian Council also telegraphed Ao Lingzhang on the 4th to refute rumors to all parties. In addition, the Mongolian Council is demanding the return of the 300 rifles that Yun Jixian took away from the Sui side. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Zhangjiakou said that the Mongolian Political Council General Assembly opened on the 3rd. Princes and nobles from the ten leagues of Xilin Gol and the twelve banners of Chahar went to the temple to attend. Those who could not spare the time also sent representatives to participate. This decision meeting is very important, because the current problems in Inner Mongolia are more serious than in Hebei and Chahar. All measures depend on this decision meeting. Prince Suo did not attend this decision Mongolian Council General Assembly and is still staying at the Prince's Mansion. The Mongolian Political Council General Assembly will separately discuss important issues such as Inner Mongolia's politics, diplomacy, construction, and fundraising. In order to increase the strength of Mongolian defense, it will pass a measure to appropriately increase the number of Mongolian banner security teams. It is heard that the issue of the council moving its headquarters may not be easy to realize in the short term. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yueqing visited Qin Decun at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 4th to discuss the Mongolian disaster, requesting Qin to convene charitable groups in Beiping to discuss fundraising methods. Qin expressed his willingness to strongly support. Because Song Zheyuan had agreed to help raise funds for the Mongolian disaster, Bao planned to wait for Song to return to Beiping before visiting him again to discuss the matter. Once there is a result, he will return to Bailingmiao to report to the Mongolian Political Council. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Promulgation of the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Now that the draft constitution has been promulgated, the people of the whole country are paying serious attention to it with an attitude of joy. The people are not unaware that although the promulgation of these 148 articles is today, actual implementation still depends on the final deliberation of the National Congress six months later. They are also not unaware that although the words of the new constitution of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution have true benefits, half of them depend on the sincerity and determination of practice. The reason why they are eager to express joy and seriousness is also to show their eagerness to hope for constitutional government.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Sun Yat-sen's revolution was the rule of constitution. The rule of law in modern countries is also based on the constitution. However, for twenty-five years since the establishment of the Republic of China, the fundamental law of the country has not been formulated and implemented due to political influence. Furthermore, because the country does not have a constitution that equally binds the government and the people, it is difficult for politics to be compared with the constitutional governments of modern countries. After the national crisis, the demand for opening up political power and the "Concentrate National Power to Save the Crisis" case of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of the Kuomintang jointly expressed the need for constitutional government. Therefore, since December of the 21st year, the highest organs of the party, the National Government, and the Legislative Yuan have devoted themselves to the careful drafting of the constitution and the preparations for the convening of the National Congress, and it has taken more than three years to achieve today's results.</p>
<p>The promulgation of the draft constitution today is different from the previous solicitation of opinions as a preparation for discussion by the National Congress. However, since the representatives of the National Congress exercise the four powers on behalf of the people, they have the function of representing public opinion. Even if the people's opinions on the constitution do not have to be requested by the Legislative Yuan, which has completed the responsibility of drafting, they can still contribute to the future representatives of the National Congress for reference during discussions. This reporter knows that this decision constitution draft has been revised seven times and publicly published four times. In addition to the principles set by the highest organs of the party, many opinions from various parties have been adopted. The creation of these 148 articles can be said to have been extremely careful. However, I recall that when the Fifth Plenary Session of the 23rd year deliberated the previous draft, the resolution stated that "the draft constitution of the Republic of China should adhere to the Three Principles of the People of the Premier in order to establish a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. At the same time, it should examine the current environment and dangers of the Chinese nation and consider practical political experience to create a system that is flexible and can concentrate national power..." Therefore, in addition to those that violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, national opinions on the realistic environment may still be contributed to the representatives of the National Congress. Needless and pointless disputes are certainly not desirable. The review of the main points is necessary. This is why the people cannot merely rejoice and take seriously the promulgation of today's draft constitution, but must also conduct careful research.</p>
<p>As for the preparations for the constitution to become a formal constitution and be implemented, there are many things that the people should strive for. To cite a few major ones, how should the four powers be exercised according to the experience of the law during the period of political tutelage to make them develop? How should local autonomy complete the many characteristics contained in the draft constitution to make it have practical benefits? All of this must be done with a positive attitude to arouse their proper political interest so that they can live up to the constitution.</p>
<h3>Zheng Luosheng and Others Petition the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Liang Han Cao Speaks</p>
<p>The Distribution of Overseas Chinese Representatives in the National Assembly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the distribution of the quota for overseas Chinese representatives in the National Assembly Representative Election Law, the quota for representatives from Siam and Malaya has been slightly changed compared to the original draft. Zheng Luosheng and others, former overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia now serving in Beijing, specifically went to the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 4th to petition. Liang Han Cao received them and gave a detailed explanation. The reporter also recently met with Liang Han Cao, who stated that Southeast Asian overseas Chinese have supported the revolution for a long time and their contributions are well-known. In events such as the Huizhou, Zhennanguan, Hekou, and Huanghuagang uprisings, Sun Yat-sen and other martyrs used Southeast Asia as a base for planning. Overseas Chinese compatriots enthusiastically responded, not only contributing generously but also returning to the country to serve, greatly contributing to the overthrow of autocracy and the establishment of the republic. Later, during Yuan Shikai's usurpation of power, Zhang Xun's restoration, and the era of warlord rule, Southeast Asian overseas Chinese continued to enthusiastically support the party's revolution. The members of the Legislative Yuan are deeply familiar with the perseverance of the Southeast Asian overseas Chinese and greatly admire them. The decision to increase the quotas for the United States and the Philippines by one each was purely because the total quota for overseas Chinese representatives was only forty. The members of the Legislative Yuan determined the number of representatives based on the population size of overseas Chinese in each region and their participation in the revolution. Initially, both Malaya and Siam were allocated five representatives, the highest number. However, overseas Chinese in the United States and the Philippines felt that the quotas of two and one, respectively, were proportionally too small. After discussion by the Yuan, it was proposed to increase the quotas. Therefore, two representatives were taken from the highest quota and added to the Americas and the Philippines, resulting in the final approval. In reality, the members of the Legislative Yuan deeply admire the revolutionary history of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, Malaya, and Siam and have absolutely no intention of showing any bias. The glorious revolutionary history of the Southeast Asian overseas Chinese is as immortal as the Republic of China. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>The Panchen Lama Postpones His Trip to Labrang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Panchen Lama was originally scheduled to depart from Ta'er Temple on the 23rd day of the third month of the Tibetan calendar to go to Labrang Monastery to chant scriptures and preach.

The Panchen Lama's Beijing Office recently received a telegram from the Panchen Lama stating that the climate in Gansu is still cold, the luggage is heavy, and the fodder needed for camels and horses is not ready. Therefore, he has decided to postpone his departure. In addition, Kang Fu'an, the Panchen Lama's representative in Lhasa, came to Beijing from Tibet in January to report on the situation in Tibet to the central government.

<h3>Agreed on Measures to Reorganize the Daokou-Qinghua Railway Loan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The British bondholders of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway loan have not been repaid on schedule due to the railway's insufficient revenue. In order to maintain China's foreign creditworthiness, the Ministry of Railways has long been determined to reorganize the loan. After lengthy negotiations with the British side, three reorganization methods have been agreed upon. The London Council of Foreign Bondholders and the Fu Company have requested bondholders to accept the methods, and it is scheduled to be announced in Nanjing and London on the 5th. The original text of the methods is as follows: 1. Interest payment method: From 1936 to 1938, interest will be paid at 2.5% per annum. However, if the Daokou-Qinghua Railway's annual cash surplus within three years is sufficient to cover all debt principal and interest payments (including the principal and interest of this loan), the interest on this loan can be increased to a maximum of 5%. From 1939 onwards, annual interest will be paid at 5%. 2. Principal repayment method: The principal of this loan totals £495,700. Starting in July 1936, it will be repaid in installments over a period of 27 years. 3. Elimination of overdue interest method: Bondholders agree to waive four-fifths of the overdue interest. The un-waived portion will be reissued as interest-free small notes, which will be paid after the principal of this loan is fully repaid after 1966. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>The Ethiopian Emperor Takes His Family on a British Warship and Leaves the Country for Palestine. Entrusting Power to the Cabinet is Not Abdication. Rumor that He Intends for Ethiopia to Conduct Peace Negotiations for the Surrender of the City</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons today that the Ethiopian Emperor and his entourage have departed from Djibouti today on the British cruiser "HMS Enterprise" bound for the port of Haifa in Palestine.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, the Ethiopian Emperor told British Minister Sir Barton that he had relinquished power and entrusted it to the cabinet. The Emperor also wished to take his family to Palestine. The British government felt obliged to comply with this request, and therefore dispatched the cruiser "HMS Enterprise" to Djibouti to transport the Emperor directly to the port of Haifa. It is expected to depart at 6:00 PM tonight (local time). The British government naturally hopes that the Emperor will not be involved in the war while residing in Palestine. The Foreign Secretary deeply praised the members of the British Legation in the Ethiopian capital for their resourceful handling of the dangerous situation, and acknowledged that British Minister Sir Barton had been tireless in his work. His praise cannot be expressed merely through commendation. A company of Indian soldiers stationed at the British Legation saved many lives and their bravery is commendable. The British expatriates in the Ethiopian capital repeatedly risked their lives to rescue Europeans and other people in times of emergency, demonstrating commendable courage. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that before leaving the capital, the Ethiopian Emperor had requested the British to leave a warship anchored in Djibouti for his use. The Emperor also stated that he had entrusted his power to the Ethiopian government, but this did not mean formal abdication. The British government has agreed to his request. It is not yet known, but two British destroyers have indeed sailed from Aden, one of which is heading to Djibouti. The Emperor's request has created a difficult situation. Will Italy be happy to see the Emperor? Will it object to the British warship taking him away? It is believed that this is what the British must consider when deciding to send a warship for his use. It is reported that France is prepared to welcome the Emperor to reside in France, provided that he does not engage in any attempts to interfere with the war. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(London) In the interest of the Ethiopian Emperor's future and maintaining the League of Nations' sanctions front, Britain conducted urgent negotiations with France today. Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the Ethiopian Emperor is the head of a state, the commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian army, and a member of the League of Nations, therefore neutral countries should not treat him as a prisoner. Well-informed observers believe that Britain and France will convene a three-power conference including Italy to resolve the Ethiopian issue. (National Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Unconfirmed reports received here today indicate that the Italian army's delayed entry into the Ethiopian capital is due to peace negotiations for the surrender of the city. The Italian authorities naturally wish to formally enter the city after reaching a negotiated compromise, rather than taking it by force. It is not yet known who from the Ethiopian side is participating in the negotiations. According to rumors several days ago, the mayor and police chief of the Ethiopian capital and another official planned to greet the Italian army a few miles outside the city. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French political circles are currently unaware of the Ethiopian Emperor's whereabouts. It is reported that before leaving the capital, the Emperor expressed his desire to travel to land under the British flag. If the Emperor wishes to go to French Somaliland, the French authorities there will treat him with due respect and he is free to stay or leave as he pleases. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Resisting a Powerful Enemy, the Ethiopian Emperor is Glorious Even in Defeat</h3>
<p>The Port of Djibouti is Saluted by the People</p>
<p>The Governor of Somalia Treats Him as a Distinguished Guest</p>
<p>Djibouti: The Ethiopian Emperor and his entourage are still stationed in Djibouti and did not depart by ship yesterday. They may depart today, but their destination is currently unknown. It is speculated that they will first go to Aden and then to London. When the Emperor and his entourage arrived here yesterday, the Governor of Djibouti and his entourage were all dressed in formal attire, and the commander of the French garrison and other high-ranking officials, along with a company of Filipino soldiers, stood in double file on the platform to greet him. There were only a few onlookers at the station because very few people knew of the Emperor's arrival. After the Emperor's family arrived, they took vehicles prepared by the French Governor to the Governor's residence. Filipino soldiers were stationed along the route to provide security. After the news of the Emperor's arrival spread, several hundred people gathered in front of the Governor's residence, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Emperor. Many of the onlookers shed tears for the Emperor's loss of his country and exile. When a part of the Emperor's entourage arrived at the Ethiopian consulate here, an incident occurred. An Italian tried to take a photograph, but was stopped by an Ethiopian, resulting in a fistfight between the two. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>French Port of Djibouti: The Ethiopian Emperor and a party of more than twenty members of the imperial family will leave here tomorrow morning, most likely on the British destroyer "Diana" bound for the port of Aden. It is generally believed that the Emperor may travel from Aden to Britain. The Emperor's special train arrived here at 2 p.m. today, later than scheduled, having been delayed for some time en route, the reason for which is unknown. The Governor of French Somaliland and local senior civil and military officials were waiting at the station. From the station platform to the Governor's residence, Senegalese soldiers were stationed along the route to prevent passers-by from approaching. After the train arrived, the soldiers played music to pay their respects. The Empress, her face covered with a thick veil, got off the train first, followed by the Emperor, who was dressed in white, without a hat, and looked very tired. He refused to make a statement and asked French officials not to allow reporters and photographers to approach. He then went to the Governor's residence in the same car with Prince Makonnen and the Governor of Somaliland. The Empress, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen, and the commander of the French garrison followed in the second car. The people along the way were moved to see the Emperor's countenance and cheered to show their respect. After the Emperor and his entourage arrived at the Governor's residence, they had a light meal, having not eaten since last night, and then retired to their rooms to rest. Foreign Minister Hailu, Northern Commander General Gasser, and others also came with the Emperor. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Djibouti: The Governor of French Somaliland visited Yasu, the grandson of former Ethiopian Emperor Menelik, in the town of Tadjoura this afternoon after receiving the Ethiopian Emperor and his party. He returned here in the evening. (Note: Yasu succeeded Menelik after his death, but was deposed and imprisoned in the mountains for being incompetent and useless. Emperor Haile Selassie was replaced by Ras Tafari after being deposed. He has been imprisoned for twenty years. It is heard that as the Emperor was defeated and exiled, Italy plans to install Yasu as the new Emperor of Ethiopia.) The local authorities have taken various measures to prevent incidents from occurring during the Emperor's stay. The wireless telephone between here and the Ethiopian capital has been out of service since last night. It is said that the streets there are littered with corpses. After the riots, two factions are vying for power, one led by General Ayarra, the governor of the northernmost province, and the other led by General Wason. Wason was the head of the government after the Emperor's exile. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Soldiers and Bandits Randomly Burn and Loot, Turning the Ethiopian Capital into a Field of Rubble</h3>
<p>The Italian Army Will Gain Nothing Upon Entering the City</p>
<p>The Streets Are Desolate, with Corpses Lying Everywhere</p>
<p>Only the Howls of Wild Dogs Can Be Heard, Creating a Bleak Scene</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: A Reuters correspondent reports that the Ethiopian capital is a wasteland. Several fires are not yet fully extinguished. Corpses are lying all over the streets. The city center has been completely burned down. The Customs Building is still smoldering. Several armories have exploded. The number of dead and wounded throughout the city cannot be estimated, because most of the people have become murderous and arsonist bandits, determined to leave an empty city for the Italian army. Looking north from the top of a small hill in the British embassy garden, it is said that dust can be seen rising thirty miles away, probably from the vanguard of the Italian army, but this may be slightly delayed by the rain. Currently, only one foreigner has been killed: Mrs. Stanton, a Seventh-day Adventist missionary, was killed by a stray bullet in her residence. Initially, many foreigners went to the American embassy for refuge, but eventually all moved to the British embassy. (National Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: Ethiopian mobs have been looting and killing since Saturday. Today, they attacked the headquarters of the British Red Cross, but were repelled by the director, Mr. Lambie. One Ethiopian was killed and one was injured. The Turkish consulate was also attacked. Afterwards, the Indian infantry from the British embassy arrived and the mobs scattered, leaving twelve bodies behind. Two Reuters correspondents are here. One of Mr. Lorebeau's servants was shot in the leg. When Mr. Eames went out to report the news today, the glass of his car was also pierced by bullets. According to the latest news, the Italian army is now encamped in the Akaki plain, ten miles from the city. White flags are flying atop the earthen houses along the way. The government treasury has been broken into by the mob and looted. Rebellious Gala tribesmen are guarding outside the city. Whenever they see mobs carrying their looted property and trying to escape into the mountains, they attack them. Occasionally, a few Gala tribesmen, armed with spears, enter the city with Gala women dressed as men. By this evening, the city has been slightly quieter. The streets are deserted, and only the howls of wild dogs can be heard as they search for food and corpses. (National Telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from Ambassador Bodard in Ethiopia, reporting on the situation in the Ethiopian capital. It is said that the chaotic state there is like a revolution. This afternoon, deserters from the front line swarmed into the city, like horses freed from their reins, uncontrollable. They set fire to the palace, shops, and the residences of European expatriates. In an instant, the city was ablaze. These people looted wildly in the midst of the fire. There were also cases of mobsters killing each other. In addition, groups of troublemakers roamed the streets, inciting unrest, determined to destroy everything, so that when the Italian army entered the city, all they would find would be a field of rubble. In the chaos, a total of twenty-four European expatriates were killed. All foreign embassies have now issued curfews. The French embassy is sheltering 1,500 expatriates from sixteen countries, many of whom are women and children. One pregnant woman, about to give birth, fled in panic and gave birth to a baby in the embassy last night. Several other expatriates took refuge at the railway station. The refugees valiantly resisted when Ethiopian rioters came to attack, and were spared. In addition, two French expatriates were suddenly attacked by rioters. Isolated and helpless, they were in great danger. Fortunately, they had weapons, repelled the rioters, and managed to escape to the embassy. Multiple groups of rioters also attacked the front of the embassy, intending to loot it. There were as many as 2,000 rioters, but they were repelled by the embassy's Askari guards. Two expatriates were shot and injured. The French government recently sent a telegram to Ambassador Bodard, praising him for his proper handling of the situation and the calmness of the expatriates. Ambassador Bodard will read the telegram to the public and offer words of comfort to the refugees. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: It is said that the Italian army advanced to the Akaki River, ten miles from the Ethiopian capital, last night, and will enter the city today. The looting and robbery by bandits and scattered soldiers has slightly subsided, but armed bandits have entered the city, endangering the lives of citizens and expatriates. British expatriates, except for a few Arabs who have erected barriers in their homes to defend themselves, are all residing peacefully in the British embassy and elsewhere. Expatriates of twenty-three nationalities are taking refuge in the British embassy. The embassy was attacked by bandits armed with rifles and machine guns. After resisting for several hours, the embassy staff decided to leave the embassy. With the help of the British embassy guards, they safely escaped. It is estimated that a total of ten Europeans in the Ethiopian capital have been killed, mostly of Greek and Armenian nationality. Yesterday, the British embassy's rescue team recovered more than 300 wounded Ethiopians in the city. A group of Ethiopian bandits, in a streetcar loaded with valuables, went to the British embassy and offered to sell them back to the original owners. The entire carload of goods was confiscated by the British embassy. A young man was rescued and taken to the British embassy. He said that his residence was surrounded by a large group of bandits, who had several machine guns. He and two companions resisted until they ran out of ammunition. The three of them killed twenty bandits before running out of ammunition, and then escaped on a rescue team's heavy truck. Bandits surrounded the Bank of Abyssinia for several hours. The bank's employees and servants fought bravely. Later, with the protection of the guards, they were able to reach the British embassy. Ethiopians are still looting and randomly firing shots into the air. Several fires have broken out again in the city. In addition, today there is heavy rain, making the refugees even more miserable.

<p>(Paris) According to a recent prepaid telegram from the French Minister to Abyssinia, Mr. Bodard, in the Abyssinian capital, French nationals at the French Legation and the railway station were subjected to fierce attacks by Abyssinian rioters. The French Legation was targeted by Abyssinians twice, suffering thousands of bullet hits. Fortunately, a shelter had been dug in the legation in recent months, so the women and children were unharmed. Although food and water supplies are sufficient in the French Legation, there is a severe shortage of ammunition. The Abyssinian Youth Party warned the French Legation that the Abyssinian people would continue to attack the legation. French nationals taking refuge at the station were also besieged by Abyssinian rioters, a situation that is particularly worrying. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Special Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet held a special meeting today to consider: the developments in Abyssinia; the submission to Hitler of his peace proposals; the leak of the budget secrets, (which made the public prepare insurance against the increase of tea tax and income tax at the last minute). The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Chamberlain, will make a statement in the House of Commons today regarding the leak of the budget secrets. Due to the changing situation in Abyssinia, the Foreign Office was very active yesterday afternoon. Foreign Secretary Eden, who had gone to the countryside, has returned to the city, taking a streetcar to the Foreign Office to consult with officials. Prime Minister Baldwin, who was resting in Chequers, also returned to 10 Downing Street at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Abyssinian King boarded a British destroyer and sailed to an unknown location. The British authorities have given their approval. It is said that after the Abyssinian King fled, a British destroyer was sent to Djibouti to provide the British Consul with rapid transportation. The Abyssinian King's future plans depend partly on his own wishes and partly on the wishes of the French government, as the Abyssinian King is now a guest of the French government. The British government is currently consulting with the French government on this matter. London has not yet heard of the Abyssinian King's formal abdication. When the Abyssinian King left the Abyssinian capital, he handed over the government's powers to his cabinet members. (4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Increased Ship Dues for the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>New Contract Between Egypt and the Canal Company</p>
<p>(Cairo) Today, a decree signed by the late King Fuad of Egypt regarding the contract between the Egyptian government and the Suez Canal Company was published. The maximum ship dues for vessels passing through the canal, which was 36 piasters per ton, will now be increased by 63 piasters (10 gold francs). This is because Egypt recently announced the abolition of the gold standard, and the value of the Egyptian currency is calculated in gold. It is feared that it will depreciate, so the ship dues are increased to avoid losses to the Suez Canal Company due to the depreciation of the currency. The company has agreed to allow two Egyptians to join the company's board of directors and has decided that Egyptians will account for one-quarter of the company's employees.

Right-Wing National Front - 99 seats: (A) Republican Democratic Union Party 88 seats; (B) Conservative Party 11 seats.</p>
<p>The parties belonging to the Left-Wing People's Front won a total of 39 seats in the 60 constituencies of Paris and its suburbs, of which 32 seats belong to the Communist Party. (4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) As of 1:30 AM this morning, the results of the Chamber of Deputies re-election showed that of the 618 seats, 614 have been announced. The rate of increase in the number of seats for the parties of the Left-Wing People's Front far exceeded expectations, and the leftward shift of the new Chamber of Deputies is undoubtedly confirmed. The number of seats for the Orthodox Socialist Party was only 96 in the previous Chamber, but has now increased to 146, making it the party with the most seats, which can be called a pioneering event in the history of the French Republic. Other socialist parties, such as the Republican Socialist Union Party, which holds 25 seats, and the Independent Socialist Party, which holds 10 seats, when added to the seats won by the Orthodox Socialist Party, total 181 seats, and will occupy the largest force in the new Chamber of Deputies. It has been 20 years since the Radical Socialist Party was the largest party in the Chamber, and now its position has been taken over by the socialist parties, which is a characteristic of this election result. Furthermore, the Communist Party, including the independent Communist Party, only held 20 seats in the previous Chamber of Deputies, but has now increased to 81 seats, becoming one of the largest parties in the new Chamber, which is also most noteworthy. As for the Radical Socialist Party, which held 160 seats in the previous Chamber of Deputies, it has now decreased to 108 seats, and has retreated to the position of the Orthodox Socialist Party, its losses are comparable to those of the right-wing parties. However, the party still occupies a position of influencing the political situation in the new Chamber. Generally speaking, when a future left-wing cabinet is formed, if it is influenced by the Communist Party, at least half of the Radical Socialist Party members will vote against the new cabinet. Fortunately, the Communist Party has already stated that if the new cabinet is organized by the Socialist Party, it does not intend to participate, so the Radical Socialist Party may not make things difficult for the new cabinet. However, the Communist Party has also stated that if the new cabinet's domestic and foreign policies are in line with the minimum program of the Left-Wing People's Front, the party will provide assistance. According to political figures, France's foreign policy in the future will not undergo any substantial changes, but the influence of the Communist Party members may make the cooperation between France and the Soviet Union closer. As for economic and financial aspects, since Marxist members occupy more than one-third of the seats in the new Chamber, it is possible that the legal system for all social undertakings will be changed. Prime Minister Sarraut will continue to serve until May 31, and then resign with his entire cabinet to President Lebrun. At that time, the President will entrust the leader of the Orthodox Socialist Party, Leon Blum, to form a new cabinet in accordance with the Constitution. It is not yet known whether he will be appointed, but in any case, there is no doubt that the new cabinet will have socialist participation (note that the party has always refused to participate in the cabinet, only making an exception to join the cabinet during the European War). The Sarraut cabinet is now scheduled to hold an important meeting on Tuesday (May 5) to discuss the political situation after the Chamber of Deputies re-election. (4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sarraut Cabinet Shaken</h3>
<p>Socialist Party Prepares to Take Over Power</p>
<p>(Paris) The Communist Party's great victory in this Chamber of Deputies re-election has threatened the Sarraut cabinet. Prime Minister Sarraut is now scheduled to convene an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday, because cabinet members Sutoen and Dede have both failed in the election, and Gunode and Niger have also been defeated, so there are already four cabinet members who cannot serve. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the conclusion and announcement of the second round of voting in the Chamber of Deputies election, the Orthodox Socialist Party has become the largest party. The party leader, Leon Blum, recently published an article in the party newspaper "People's Daily," which stated: "After the victory of our party, we are now prepared to fulfill our mission. What is the mission? It is to organize and lead the new cabinet of the People's Front." Our party has the most seats in the new Chamber of Deputies compared to other parties, and is in the middle position between the other two parties of the People's Front, namely the Communist Party and the Radical Socialist Party, so we should obtain power.

<h3>Herriot Has Been Elected</h3>
<p>(Paris) In the second round of voting in the Chamber of Deputies re-election, the Mayor of Lyon and former leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Herriot, has been elected. Others who have been elected include former Finance Minister Leino (who advocated the devaluation of the franc), Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Puisson, one of the leaders of the Left-Wing People's Front, Pesseley, and the leader of the Independent Communist Party, Doriot. However, the leader of the Right-Wing National Front, Puyong, and the current Minister of Aviation, Tea (Radical Socialist Party), have been defeated. (4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Stock Market Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the announcement of the results of the second round of voting in the Chamber of Deputies election, the stock market has experienced adverse effects. French government bonds and Bank of France stocks have fallen sharply, while foreign securities have risen sharply. Bank of France stock has fallen from 7250 points to 6500 points, and French government bonds have fallen from 67.05 points to 65.45 points. (4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain Watches French Political Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Londoners are now watching developments in France, believing that if the general public panics upon seeing the left wing's election victory, it will force the franc to break away from the gold standard before a new cabinet is formed. Therefore, the future of the French currency will depend on the attitude of the general public. However, some people also say that most of those who voted for the left wing yesterday were ordinary people, and they may not panic suddenly on Sunday. The sale of francs this morning is the most seen in recent years. When the French exchange rate was 75.27, the British Equalization Fund wanted to maintain it again, but it still failed to stop the selling pressure. The British Equalization Fund has purchased a large amount of gold, so a question has been raised: How long can the British authorities maintain the French currency? Because the gold purchased by the Equalization Fund has now reached its saturation point. It is reported that a large amount of cash was transported to New York again today. The Board of Directors of the Bank of France has now convened a special meeting to discuss the overall situation. (4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross Returns to England to Discuss China's Political and Economic Progress; Achievements of the Central Government Increase Daily; Financial Prospects Show Obvious Improvement</h3>
<p>Sir Frederick Scheduled to Take Up New Post as Foreign Under-Secretary in Mid-July</p>
<p>(London) The former British Ambassador to China, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, returned here last night with his wife and children to take up the post of Foreign Under-Secretary. In a conversation with a Reuters reporter, he said that the achievements of the Chinese Central Government are increasing daily, which is a prominent feature of the Chinese situation. President Chiang Kai-shek is very admirable and has great ability, never slacking off. He is a statesman and a true patriot. The economic work done by the Nanjing government is very obvious, and the financial prospects are also showing improvement. He believes that China's new currency system can be successful, and the Central Bank's power to stabilize the currency is also extremely important. The rural situation, at least in central China, is gradually improving. Although low prices have burdened farmers, and irregular taxes are still too high, farmers are no longer suffering the pain of having all their assets swallowed up by greedy and brutal warlords. China has a vast territory and lacks transportation, so although the Communist bandits have been greatly reduced, they are still a serious problem. The students' unrest originates from hostility towards Japan, and university authorities are very worried. However, this kind of situation exists in many countries. The recent talks between student representatives and President Chiang have cleared the air a lot. The New Life Movement is a very interesting phenomenon. Some of its tenets may not be necessary in the eyes of foreigners, but basically, it originates from the deepest things in Chinese culture, so it is obviously a starting point and a legitimate goal in the work of national revival. As for the future, of course, much depends on Sino-Japanese relations. Although he is now happy to return home, he enjoyed his two years in China very much. His life in China was very interesting. He now brings many happy ideas with him, the most important of which is his confidence in China's goodwill towards England. Sir Frederick will have a short vacation and is scheduled to take up his new post in mid-July. (4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Planting Alfalfa to Reduce Siltation in the Yellow River</h3>
<p>The Economic Commission Establishes an Alfalfa Seed Nursery in Suiyuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission believes that the problem of the Yellow River lies in the siltation, and the source of siltation is due to the erosion of the loess slopes in the northwest. In order to prevent erosion, while preparing a fundamental plan, it will first widely plant alfalfa in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The northwest climate is dry, and trees are not easy to grow, and the area is too large, so planting trees cannot be universal in a short time. However, alfalfa is drought-resistant and does not require irrigation, and it can grow and reproduce. Moreover, the root system is very deep and intertwined, which is more effective in preventing erosion than trees. If the loess slopes in the northwest can be planted extensively, the siltation of the Yellow River can be reduced. The Commission previously ordered the agricultural office to establish an alfalfa seed nursery in Suiyuan, and the office, together with the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, sent personnel to the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu to investigate the geology and livestock feed in order to proceed with the work. According to the reply, the benefits of alfalfa are great, so it should be planted directly and should be actively promoted to achieve universality. Recently, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission was ordered to quickly consult with the relevant provincial governments in the upper reaches of the Yellow River to plant it widely, and at the same time, to quickly formulate an engineering plan in order to reduce the siltation of the Yellow River.

<h3>All Sectors of Lancang, Yunnan Province, Strive for the Yunnan-Myanmar Border Line</h3>
<p>Visiting Boundary Survey Committee to State Opinions</p>
<p>Striving on the Basis of Reason to Maintain National Territory</p>
<p>And Pointing Out Various Conspiracies Pre-Plotted by the British</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence, The Yunnan-Myanmar boundary survey has been pending for a long time. In recent years, due to many national affairs, border affairs have been abandoned, and the British have taken the opportunity to operate, resulting in frequent border police reports. Since the central government appointed boundary survey personnel last year to go to Yunnan with British and neutral members to conduct on-site surveys on the border, the Chinese people have focused their attention. According to news from Lancang, this boundary survey is closely related to the survival of the county's borders. The gentlemen of the county specially convened a mass meeting to discuss ways to strive for the boundary. They elected Zhang Shi'an, the seventh district chief of the county, as well as Gong Zhiyi, Huang Daoneng, and Shi Youwen as representatives to visit the survey committee and express public opinion. The representatives believe that the matter concerns the country's borders, and that the area is the place that the British must contend for. Therefore, they have hurried off yesterday and have formulated two key points for striving before their departure, asking all parties to support and respond to preserve sovereignty. At the same time, they disclosed various conspiracies and designs pre-plotted by the British during the past boundary surveys. The key points and the British conspiracy are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Key Points for Striving</p>
<p>Please take the Nan Kong River as the natural boundary line between Yunnan and Myanmar. The reason is that Myanmar has historically been a vassal state of China. It was seized by the British by force in the eleventh year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. Outside the territory of Myanmar, the area east of the Gunlong River has followed our orders. British government orders have not yet been reached, and it is naturally our territory. The British have no reason to force the name "Unfinished Boundary" and have no reason to invade the central part of our county. In order to prevent problems before they occur and stop the British's insatiable ambitions, please take the Nan Kong River as the natural boundary line to protect the border and save sovereignty. The land of the 11 Zhaohua should be assigned to our country. The reason is that the land of the 11 Zhaohua has previously accepted our country's appointment and has seals that can be verified. It should be assigned to our country. If this decision is due to the permission of the Chinese members, allowing the British army to enter the country, using force and frightening, and using various means of money temptation, causing them to be at a loss, the Chinese members must be responsible for restoring it in the future if the land of the 11 Zhaohua is assigned to the British.</p>
<p>British Conspiracy</p>
<p>The British conspiracies and tricks in the Yunnan-Myanmar boundary affairs are too numerous to mention. During the Guangxu years of the Qing Dynasty, the British took the opportunity of the boundary survey to operate in the Yunnan border (Lancang) territory. They specialized in making various conspiracies and facilities on the highest mountain, such as the so-called "hitting the sun," "looking at the telescope," chopping down trees, burying stones, etc. The general public did not understand their intentions and thought it was not important. It was not until Yong Weirui's aggressive teaching of affairs that it aroused old memories and knew that the British were felling big trees and burying stones on the Gao Feng Guan and Kongming Mountains. The intention was to pre-bury marks to make evidence for future boundary cheating. For a time, driven by patriotic heart, they automatically dug everywhere, but because of the long years, the place where the British buried the stones earlier could not be recognized. Only one piece was found in the Luoshuidong place, on which the handwriting can still be seen. In addition, Sigede of Ximishan (i.e., Ximeng) also buried three places, and it is said that there are inscriptions. It was dug up once a few years ago, but it was not found. Although this situation cannot determine the other party's intention at that time, it is known that if the result of this boundary survey dispute is not satisfactory to the other party, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be used as evidence for the boundary dispute. Therefore, we dare to reveal it here first, so that the authorities know the details and the people of the country know its intentions, so as not to be deceived by its conspiracy. Then it is not only the blessing of Lancang County, but also the happiness of Yunnan Province and the whole of China.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Mining Exploration in Anxi</h3>
<p>—Poor Results from a Recent Drilling Hole—</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, The iron ore in Anxi Pantianzhen, Fujian Province, is well-known at the time. Last year, the Construction Department hired members of the Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica to come to Fujian to survey. They believed that the iron in Pantian was still good and estimated that the reserves were 30 million tons. Afterwards, the Japanese technicians of the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences were hired to inspect it, and the results were the same. However, the survey could not determine exactly what the iron quality was and how much the ore deposit was. Last winter, the Anxi Mining Exploration Team was organized, and the Construction Department established the "Anxi Iron Ore Exploration Project Office", appointing Zhao Xiujin as the director and hiring 17 Japanese technicians from the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd., including Soma Hideo, to be divided into four departments: mineral surveying, cone testing, harbor, and railway. Zhao led the team to work in Anxi. Mineral surveying is geological investigation, railway is surveying and exploring the railway from the iron mine to the seaport, and harbor is surveying and exploring the seaport at the end of land transportation. If the ore is mined, production must be transported by sea and land for export. It is also a plan for the whole process. Until April, the work of mineral surveying, railway and harbor has been completed. Zhen's land is a silver-lead mixture and has no mining value. However, Pantian is very good. The Japanese technicians have returned to their country one after another. There is still a cone testing department specializing in Pantian iron ore, which is the most important part of the project. A diamond cone mining machine was borrowed from the South Manchuria Railway Company to drill a 400-meter-deep hole under the ore bed to explore the amount of iron stored in it and the iron content of the ore sand. In March, a hole was drilled in Pantian. The iron content of the ore sand was 50%, which can be called a good ore, and the reserves were rumored to be 80 million tons, but according to Li Qishan, a technician of the Construction Department, it should be 30 million tons. Currently, there are still three Japanese technicians in Anxi who are drilling mines: Nagaya Haraketsu, Takabayashi Ketsuro, and Fukuyama. At the end of April, another hole was drilled, 600 feet deep. The test results were not good. The ore sand components were not iron, and there was a layer of sand every other layer. After this hole is completed, it is planned to drill a hole, which can be completed by the end of August this year. The purpose of mining exploration is to determine the quality and reserves of iron in order to determine whether it is worth mining. Because the mining railway and harbor equipment requires a capital of 30 million yuan, we must be cautious. (May 3)</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaoqing's Report on the Inspection of the Huai River Diversion Project</h3>
<p>Beijing News, Zheng Zhaoqing of the Economic Commission previously followed Sun Ke to inspect the Huai River Diversion to the Sea Project. After finishing the matter, he returned to Beijing and reported the inspection process to the commission as follows:</p>
<h3>(1) Inspection Itinerary</h3>
<p>On the morning of April 25, he followed Sun, the standing committee member of the Economic Commission, from Beijing by train to Zhenjiang to cross the river to Yangzhou, changed to a small wheel and went along the canal to Shaobo to inspect the ship lock project, and then to Gaoyou to inspect the Gaoyou ship lock, and stayed overnight in the wheel. At 10:00 AM on April 26, he arrived at Huaiyin, and then went to Yangzhuang to inspect the movable dam project and the nearby Huaiyin ship lock. In the afternoon, he inspected the Honghu Dam and the Huaiyin section of the Huai River Diversion to the Sea Waterway Project, and stayed overnight in Huaiyin. On April 27, he originally planned to go from Huaiyin to inspect the Huaihe River North Water Diversion Project, but because of the heavy rain last night, the road was impassable, so he still passed through the waterway to Huaian Baoying to Yangzhou. On April 28, he passed through Zhenjiang from Yangzhou and arrived in Beijing at about 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>(2) Shaobo Ship Lock</h3>
<p>The Shaobo Ship Lock is one of the Huai River Diversion projects, which is sponsored by the Huai River Diversion Committee. The project requires 600,000 yuan. It started in February of the 23rd year. Connecting the canal is an important north-south transportation route. In recent years, the water volume has been unbalanced. The maximum draft depth of passing ships is only more than one meter, and the load is less than 100 tons. The navigation is almost stopped when the water level drops in spring and winter. Therefore, in the Huai River Diversion plan, we first start by cleaning up the canal waterway. The cleaning method is to build a new-style ship lock in the canal to maintain the water depth and maintain year-round navigation. The first phase of the project starts from Congjiakou, Weishan Lake, Shandong, and ends at Sanjiangying into the river, a total of 130 kilometers, with five ship locks, namely Desheng Lock, Heding Lock, Liulaojian Lock, Huaiyin Lock, and Shaobo Lock. The ones that have been started are Liulaojian, Huaiyin, and Shaobo Locks. After completion, the minimum water depth of the canal is 2.5 meters, and ships with a draft of 2 meters can pass unimpeded. The annual transportation volume in the canal now does not exceed one million tons at most. After the waterway is cleaned up, it will inevitably gradually increase. The Shaobo Ship Lock is used to maintain the water level of the canal between Shaobo and Huaiyin. The maximum water level difference between the two ends of the lock is 7.7 meters. It is the first ship lock from the river into the canal, located west of Shaobo Town, Jiangdu. The lock chamber is 10 meters wide and 100 meters long. Each time, 15 ships of 30 tons, 10 ships of 40 tons, 8 ships of 60 tons, 6 ships of 100 tons, 4 ships of 300 tons, and 1 ship of 900 tons can pass. The lock gate is made of steel with a switch machine on the top. A water channel is also set up on both sides of the lock chamber. If the ship comes from the upstream, first release water from the water pipe into the lock to make the water surface of the lock chamber level with the upstream, and then open the upper gate. The ship enters the lock, and at the same time, the upstream ship waiting in the lock chamber can leave the lock. Then close the upper gate and discharge the water to make the water level of the lock chamber level with the downstream, and then open the lower gate. The downstream ship can leave the lock and sail down, and at the same time, the upstream ship can enter the lock, and then close the lower gate. In this way, it is repeated once. When the water level difference between the upstream and downstream is the largest, it takes at most one hour. Now all parts of the ship lock have been built, and the filling project on both sides of the lock chamber is being handled. It is expected to be completed by the end of June this year.</p>
<h3>(3) Gaoyou Ship Lock</h3>
<p>According to the Huai River Diversion Plan, after the ship locks are built along the canal, the gap in the west dam of the canal that originally connected with the lake must be blocked. Then the canal and the lakes of Gaoyou will inevitably be isolated. Therefore, a small ship lock is built near the Yuehe Port in Er Ma Bridge, west of Gaoyou City, for the passage of sailing boats between the canal and the Gaobin Lake. The lock chamber is 10 meters wide and 29 meters long. Steel sheet piles are used as vertical walls on both sides. The lock gate is single-leaf type and is opened and closed by gear machinery. It started in June of the 24th year and was fully completed in April of the 25th year. The total cost of the project is more than 67,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>(4) Huaiyin Ship Lock</h3>
<p>The Huaiyin Ship Lock is sponsored by the Huai River Diversion Committee. Because the terrain of the canal from Zhangfuhekou to Huaiyin is very different, it is not easy to maintain the benefit of year-round navigation. In the past, four stone locks, such as Huiji, were built in Huaiyin to provide restraints. The water level difference between the upper and lower reaches of the lock is huge. Usually, when sailing ships pass through the lock, they have to use manpower to turn the ropes and cables and wind them around the bow and stern to barely pass. During the flood season, the water level difference between the upper and lower reaches is even greater, and it is impossible to pass. The Huai River Diversion Plan will make the Inner Canal only for transportation and the supply of irrigation water in the future. Therefore, a ship lock is built in Huaiyin. This ship lock is a safe navigation mechanism with new-style double-channel gates. A new canal is opened straight from Zhongmatou to Yangzhuang. The ship lock is built in this canal, located about eight kilometers west of Huaiyin County. The maximum water level difference between the upper and lower reaches of the lock is 9.2 meters. The bottom width of the lock chamber is 10 meters and the length is 100 meters. Its function is that on the Middle Canal, it can maintain the water level below the Suqian Liulaojian, and on the Huai River, it can maintain the water level below Huaiyuan, Anhui. Ships with a draft of 1.1 meters can pass unimpeded all year round. There are five advantages in its design. The first is the safety of the navigation channel, which can avoid the risk of boats passing through the old lock. The second is the improvement of navigation, which can provide for the passage of large vessels. The third is to shorten the voyage. The fourth is to build the ship lock. The construction does not hinder the current situation of the canal traffic. The fifth is that the old lock can be reused. It only needs to be slightly transformed to control the amount of irrigation water. The total budget for the project is 750,000 yuan. It started in March of the 23rd year. Now all the buildings have been mostly completed and are in progress. Filling work is being carried out on both sides. It is expected that all the projects can be completed by the end of June this year.</p>
<h3>(5) Huai River Diversion to the Sea Waterway Project</h3>
<p>The Huai River Diversion to the Sea is part of the Huai River Diversion Plan. This project is sponsored by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The route starts from Yangzhuang, Huaiyin, and passes through Xiba, Lianshui, Dianhu, Yuntiguan, Qitao to Taozikou into the sea, with a total length of 167 kilometers. From Yangzhuang to Qitao, it is all in the old channel of the Yellow River. Below Qitao, a new river is opened to reach Taozikou. The original plan was for the river bottom to be 120 meters wide, with a slope of one to two point five on both sides, and a distance of 350 meters between the two dikes. In the first phase of the project, the river bottom was excavated first, with a width of 35 meters. Because the excavated soil was too far away, the distance between the two dikes was reduced to 230 meters. After completion, the discharge volume can reach 500 cubic meters per second. The total excavation volume of earthwork is 71 million cubic meters. The final approved budget was originally more than 9.8 million yuan. Later, because the soil quality of the abandoned Yellow River was mostly flowing sand and the seepage water was very strong, the river bed became deeper, and it was more difficult for manual excavation. In order to take into account the engineering expenses, the entire river bed was excavated one and a half meters less, leaving it to be scoured by water and excavated by machines. Therefore, the entire budget was reduced to more than 8.8 million yuan. In addition to the 2.2 million yuan subsidized by the association, the rest was raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It started in October of the 23rd year. Civil workers were recruited from twelve counties including Huaiyin, Siyang, Jiangdu, Taixian, Lianshui, Huaian, Gaoyou, Shiying, Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, and Funing to engage in work. Last month, more than 200,000 workers arrived. The first phase of earthwork can be completed by the end of May this year.</p>
<h3>(6) Yangzhuang Movable Dam</h3>
<p>The Yangzhuang Movable Dam is located at the western end of the sea waterway. Its purpose is to control the amount of water entering the sea from Hongze Lake and adjust the water level of the canal to facilitate irrigation and navigation. The dam adopts the Stone-Nae lift type. There are five holes, each 10 meters wide and 6.6 meters high, so it should meet the current discharge of the sea waterway. The dam base, dam pier, and highway bridge are cast with reinforced concrete, and steel sheet piles are used as bank revetment to prepare for the expansion of the sea waterway in the future. The height of the dam bottom is 7 meters, and the highest water level upstream during the water storage period is 15 meters. The budget for the project is 500,000 yuan, which is sponsored by the Huai River Diversion Committee. It started in November of the 24th year. By February 10th of this year, all the earthwork had been rushed to completion. Now the base pile project is being done, and five tenths of the steel sheet wall has been completed, and four-fifths of the pile driving work has been completed. It is estimated that the entire project can be completed by the end of August this year.</p>
<h3>(7) Honghu Embankment</h3>
<p>Hongze Lake is located southwest of Huaiyin, with Gao and Shi lakes to its east. The Huai River, carrying waters from Henan and Anhui provinces, flows into it. During the late Han Dynasty, Chen Deng, the administrator of Guangling, greatly promoted water conservancy and first built the Gao Embankment, blocking its lower reaches to make it flow north into the sea, preventing flooding in over a thousand miles of Huainan. Later generations of water managers all adhered to this old system without change. Since the Tang Dynasty, north-south transportation was open. By the Song Dynasty, the Yellow River shifted south, and the lake became wider and larger, forming a vast expanse of water. The importance of this embankment increased. During the Qingli reign of the Ming Dynasty, it was first repaired by Zhang Lunming, the transport commissioner, and then by Chen Xuan, the Earl of Pingjiang. During the Wanli reign, Pan Jixun, the director-general of river management, extensively repaired it, and reinforced over three thousand zhang with stone, making it even more solid. After the Yellow River flowed backward, the lakebed rose, and the lake water also rose accordingly. The terrain outside the embankment was low-lying. Once it breached, the seven counties downstream would become like the sea. In the Qing Dynasty, Jin Fu also greatly repaired and managed it. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River shifted north, and the Huai River lost its original course. The Huai River pooled in Honghu Lake, making the embankment even more important. From Huaiyin to Jiangba, the embankment is one hundred and twenty li long, remaining intact for hundreds of years. The Huai River Diversion Plan includes building an active dam at Jiangba to regulate the lake water. The dam is estimated to cost over five million yuan, and preparations for construction have already begun.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Absurd Rumors in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Children Unexpectedly Suffer False Alarm</p>
<p>Almost All Elementary Schools in the City Suspend Classes</p>
<p>The Situation Calms Down After the Public Security Bureau Investigates and Bans the Rumors</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: At 10 a.m. on the 1st of this month, while elementary schools throughout the city were in session, rumors suddenly spread that the government intended to conscript children to go to Nangang to work on building dams, as practice for military service labor. It was also rumored that the construction of the Luoxing Pagoda wharf in Mawei by the Construction Bureau had been completed and required the blood sacrifice of seven boys and seven girls to prevent ships from colliding with the wharf in the future. It was further rumored that a white-knife fish spirit had been discovered in the Wulong River the day before, causing waves and obstructing ships from crossing the river. It had appeared in a dream to village elders, demanding the sacrifice of children before it would sink back into the river. Additionally, it was rumored that the Yellow River project in Shandong could not be completed and required five hundred children to fill the riverbed before the project could be finished, ordering each province to select twenty bright and intelligent children to be sent for use. Therefore, government officials were sending people to intercept homeless children on the streets. All of these were bizarre, preposterous, and unfounded rumors. Some even claimed that over a hundred children had already been taken from various elementary schools and loaded onto two public buses, to be transported along the Fuquan Highway and Fuma Highway. It was said with such vividness that many people without common sense or reason actually believed it to be true. In the morning, the rumors only circulated in Nantai, but by the afternoon, they had spread throughout the city. For a time, the city was in turmoil, and the people were alarmed. Children attending elementary schools felt as if a great calamity was imminent, and they rushed to be picked up. Many people gathered outside the gates of various elementary schools, clamoring and shouting, with the sounds of calling for sons and daughters filling the air. On the roads, women and men could be seen carrying children, sitting in vehicles, rushing back and forth, all with panicked expressions. The rickshaw business suddenly boomed. Even educated people, knowing that the above rumors were ridiculous, were bewildered by the state of the city. Fearing that some unexpected accident might have occurred, they also kept their children at home to ensure their safety. As a result, almost all elementary schools in the city suspended classes in the afternoon. Upon hearing the news, the Public Security Bureau, in addition to urgently ordering all branch bureaus and detective teams to investigate and arrest the rumor-mongers for prosecution, also dispatched police to various elementary schools to explain to the students' families that nothing was happening and to reassure them to return home. At the same time, it issued a notice strictly prohibiting rumors. The disturbance gradually subsided by night, and people began to calm down. As for the origin of these rumors, it is said that there were three possibilities. First, because the Public Security Bureau had decided to implement the crackdown on unregistered tutors from May 1st, it sent police to unregistered private schools, ordering them to disband. The students, suddenly seeing the police arriving, suspected that they were being arrested and fled in panic, causing a misunderstanding in the community. Another possibility was that because several incidents of children being run over by cars had occurred recently, the Public Security Bureau specially dispatched two public buses to patrol the city, picking up children wandering on the streets without adult supervision and taking them to the bureau to identify their families, notify them to come to the bureau, reprimand them, and have them take the children home. A third possibility was that students from a certain elementary school were traveling to Gushan for an excursion, riding together in a public bus. A soldier was sitting in the front of the bus. Passersby, seeing this, mistakenly believed that the elementary school students were being escorted by soldiers to work, thus fabricating this great mistake. However, investigations by the Public Security Bureau and various schools have shown that none of these actions had occurred. Therefore, where did the rumors actually come from? It is truly difficult to fathom. (May 2nd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Completion of the Dredging of Panlong Pond</h3>
<p>The Panlong Pond River is a waterway connecting Baiwo Township in the First District to Sijing in the Second District. It had not been dredged for a long time, gradually becoming silted up, causing the crops in the farmlands along the river to be poor in recent years. After the farmers in the area repeatedly requested dredging, it was approved by the county government, which appointed Chen Liuzhang as the director in charge of the dredging. It is now learned that the project was completed on April 29th and has been reported to the First District Office, requesting that it be forwarded to the county government to dispatch personnel for inspection and acceptance.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Unfavorable Weather Affects Silk Production</h3>
<p>Due to weather conditions, the silkworm season in Suzhou is developing later than usual. The townships of Mudu, Xiangshan, the East and West Mountains of Dongting, and Hengjing are areas in Wu County that produce cocoons. The large silkworm farms have already begun feeding the silkworms leaves for three or four days, but because the weather is unevenly cold and warm, the success of hatching the silkworms is not good. In general, silkworm farmers are extremely worried. As for the issue of cocoon markets, the cocoon merchants who have applied for registration with the Agricultural Improvement District have reached thirty-five, including Gongda and Gongxin. Xiangshan and Dongshan have the most. The instructors of the Improvement District have already set out yesterday to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Film Actor Hong Ji Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guangyi Film Company previously sent a large group of actors to Suzhou to shoot the film "Wang Shi Chuan." Because they had not applied to the Central Film Censorship Committee for review and approval, the Censorship Committee discovered this and sent Inspector Li Gongge and others to Suzhou, confiscating three thousand feet of the "Wang Shi Chuan" film that had not yet been completed. Wang Weiqing, the person in charge, was temporarily detained by the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Hong Ji, the film's director, was taken to Beijing. The details of the incident have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Central Film Censorship Committee has thoroughly reviewed the film and determined that it does not contain any supernatural elements, and has released Hong Ji. Hong has returned to Suzhou. Wang Weiqing, who was temporarily detained by the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, was also released on bail the other day. It is expected that the "Wang Shi Chuan" film will be returned soon and filming can continue.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Entire Village in Tuli Lane Burned Down</h3>
<p>The home of Tu Fuxing, a resident of Tuli Lane in the northern countryside, suddenly caught fire on the evening of the other day, spreading to the homes of thirteen neighbors, including Tu Genpan, Tu Meisheng, and Li Apan. From east to west, everything was reduced to ashes. The men and women of the entire village cried to the heavens, and the sounds of weeping shook the sky. The scene was especially tragic. After investigation, it was found that a water buffalo was burned to death in Li Apan's house, and a five-year-old boy was burned to death in Tu Fuxing's house. A total of over fifty houses were burned down, with enormous losses. As for the cause of the fire, it is said that it was caused by a fox spirit.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Security Expenses Centralized in Provincial Treasury</h3>
<p>The security expenses of all counties in Jiangsu Province are now being uniformly collected and disbursed by the Management Office established by the District Security Command. Starting from the new fiscal year, the expenses of the security teams will be centralized in the provincial treasury. The district offices will soon be closing down. It is said that the reorganization of the security teams into regional groups will also be implemented at the same time.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Septuagenarian Killed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhaozheng, a farmer in Nanzhuang, Xi'an Township, Eighth District of this county, was seventy years old and from a family of modest means. At about 1 a.m. on the 28th, seven or eight bandits suddenly came, each carrying long and short guns, flashlights, and broadswords. They broke into the house, dragged Zhu out of bed, and burned his armpits with fire, demanding money. When they failed, they shot him in the lower abdomen, causing him to bleed profusely and lose consciousness. The bandits then looted the house and fled with the stolen goods. Neighbors, hearing the commotion, opened fire to chase after them. The bandits also returned fire, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle for half an hour. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Villagers Gather to Fight Over Embankment, Injuring People</h3>
<p>The Guadong river embankment in the Second District of Jiangdu is the most important guarantee for the farmlands and the lives of the people in the southeastern countryside. It has been designed and constructed by the Construction Bureau year after year, and it has been breached nine times. The other day, Wang Luozhang, the section chief of the Technology Section of the Construction Bureau, was sent to the embankment to survey the line and draw up plans, which were submitted for approval. One morning, Wang led five police officers from the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau to the site, where they gathered workers who had already been hired and began construction according to the surveyed and determined embankment line. Unexpectedly, while Wang was giving instructions, villagers from outside the embankment forced him to retreat the embankment line, while villagers inside the embankment wanted to expand it outwards. Wang said that the line had been approved and could not be moved. This angered the villagers. Over a thousand men and women surrounded Wang, and eight or nine women grabbed Wang's arms while others punched and kicked him, forcing him to change the embankment line and hand over the drawings. Fortunately, Wang knew some martial arts and struggled to break free, running to the inside of the embankment. Then, they heard shouts of "Beat him to death" continuously. They chased him to the nearby Dragon King Temple, where he was already seriously injured, with a dizzy head. The villagers chased him to the temple and surrounded it again. Fortunately, Xiao Tongchun, a police officer from the local police station, pretended to invite "Committee Member Wang to the police station to answer the phone." Wang took the opportunity to leave the temple and promised to return the drawings. The crowd still chased after him, refusing to let him go. In this emergency situation, Yang Yuting, the patrol leader of the police station, led four police officers, hired a car to protect Wang, and rushed back to the bureau. It was already after 4 p.m. He reported the situation of the gathering crowd to the bureau chief, who in turn reported it to the county. He also learned that in addition to the embankment line, the villagers also demanded compensation for Qingyi farmland fees and digging fees. The government had never paid fees for digging and pressing farmland, and the green seedling fees had not been approved, so they were not accepted. It is now said that the county bureau is discussing solutions to the embankment line issue.</p>

Unexpectedly, the back wall of the house, which had not been repaired for many years, suddenly collapsed at 9:30 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, crushing a wing room. Wang Jihuan's nine-year-old daughter, Wang Kang, six-year-old son, Wang Yi, maid Xu, and male servant Zhao Shou were sleeping inside. Wang had not slept due to illness.

<h3>Ningbo: Major Fire on Zhongma Road</h3>
<p>Due to carelessness while boiling tea at night, a fire broke out in Shunji Mountain Goods Store on Zhongma Road on the north bank of this port. The fire quickly spread out of control, extending to the neighboring Xietaixiang Foreign Goods Store, and the Yuanyuan Hotel, Shuntai, Wang Taihe, Qifeng Deyilou and other businesses that were preparing to open. The volunteer fire brigades rushed to the scene, but four buildings were burned down. The largest loss was Xietaixiang with an estimated cost of over ten thousand yuan, the rest about one thousand yuan each.

<h3>Xiaoshan: Kancun Fanjiayuan Becomes a Marsh</h3>
<p>The farmland in Fanjiayuan, Jiangbin Township, Kancun County, Xiaoshan, covers over two thousand mu. Due to continuous rain in recent days, the accumulated water is over a foot deep, turning the area into a vast expanse of water. Because it is surrounded by the new sand dike, there is no way for the water to drain out. If the submergence lasts too long, the spring crops will be completely destroyed. Yesterday (the 2nd), the farmers in the area gathered and requested that Yang Peinan, the director of the Zhangshendian Farmers Association, help them find a way to open the dike. Mr. Yang, along with Mr. Wang of the Nansha Water Conservancy Association, went to the site to inspect it. They found that the dike was indeed hindering the farmland irrigation. As the matter concerned agricultural production, it was proposed to open the dike immediately for rescue, and at the same time, prepare to build a sluice gate for irrigation and drainage of the accumulated water.</p>

<h3>Dr. Wang Chonghui Scheduled to Go to Beijing This Week to Meet Chiang</h3>
<p>Wei Daoming and Cheng Tiangu Will Accompany Him</p>
<p>May Travel South Around the 20th to Welcome Hu</p>
<p>Shanghai Times News: Central Committee Member Dr. Wang Chonghui decided to go to Beijing, but after returning to Shanghai, he suffered from severe nasal and dental ailments. Therefore, he has rarely left his residence in Shanghai, except to seek medical treatment and meet with various important figures to discuss the draft constitution, in order to avoid fatigue. It is now learned that Wang's ailments have been cured, and he will wait for President Chiang to return to Beijing before meeting with him. Then, around the 20th of this month, he will travel to Guangdong with President Dai, Vice President Xu, and others to welcome Hu Hanmin north. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Going to Beijing This Week</p>
<p>Wang decided to go to Beijing to meet with President Chiang and various important figures of the Central Committee. Within three days, his nasal ailment worsened, so he left Beijing for Shanghai to seek medical treatment and rest. To this day, it has been a month. Recently, he has discussed the Central Committee's draft constitution with Ye Chucang, Dai Chuanxian, Xu Chongzhi, Niu Yongjian, Cheng Tiangu, and Liu Luyin. The results have been very good. Now Wang's various ailments have been cured, and his spirit has also recovered after such a long period of rest. However, since President Chiang went to Wuhan on official business and then traveled west, he has not yet returned to Beijing, so Wang is still in Shanghai and has not made preparations to go to Beijing again. It is now confirmed that Wang will go to Beijing this week and wait to meet with President Chiang. Wei Daoming and Cheng Tiangu, who previously came north from Hong Kong, will accompany him.</p>
<p>Traveling South to Welcome Hu</p>
<p>According to sources, the unity of the country is moving towards realization. At the same time, the northern climate has become extremely mild and suitable for the health of Central Executive Committee Chairman Hu Hanmin. Therefore, Hu's trip north can be realized soon. In order to explain everything, the Central Committee has decided to send Wang, along with Xu Chongzhi, Vice President of the Control Yuan, and Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, who will represent our country at the World Games, to travel south to meet with Hu, Chen, Li, and other important figures in the southwest, and to welcome Hu to the north as soon as possible. The date of the three men's trip will be decided after Wang meets with President Chiang in Beijing. However, President Dai is scheduled to depart on the 20th of this month to represent our country at the World Games, so Wang and Xu will be able to travel with him at that time, if time permits. As for Liu Luyin, Director of the Central Publicity Department, and Cheng Tiangu, Hu Hanmin's secretary, it has not been decided if they will travel with us. It is said that Wei Daoming will no longer travel south.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Loan Syndicate to Hold Joint Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Nineteen Silver and Money Firms Have Joined</p>
<p>Loans Expected to Be Released Around the 20th</p>
<p>Nineteen silver and money firms in this city have jointly formed the Spring Cocoon Loan Syndicate for the 25th year. The syndicate has drafted various rules and regulations and will submit them for approval at a general meeting on the 5th. It will then proceed with its organization. Loans are expected to be released around the 20th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Spring Cocoon Loan Syndicate was initiated by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks. To date, eighteen banks and one money shop have joined. However, the syndicate still hopes for the cooperation of the silver and money industry. At the syndicate's inaugural meeting, various principles were formulated, and seven banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, were selected to draft the organizational charter, loan regulations, and detailed rules of procedure. A joint meeting will be held at the Bank of Communications on the Bund at 3 p.m. today to discuss the progress. It will then proceed with organizing the office.</p>
<p>Transferring Personnel for Office Work</p>
<p>The syndicate is a short-term organization, so the internal personnel will be temporarily transferred from the participating banks. The syndicate will appoint five standing committee members to handle important business. The office will be located in Shanghai and will have two divisions: general affairs and accounting. Each division will have a director and several staff members. The general affairs division will be responsible for documents, investigation, and other matters, and the accounting division will be responsible for calculation, auditing, and other matters. Branch offices will be established in Hangzhou and Wuxi to handle investigation and loan matters in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Scheduled Loan Release</p>
<p>It is said that the interest rate on the syndicate's loans is very low, but the procedures for investigating applicants and supervising cocoon collection are cautious and strict. After manufacturers apply for registration, the investigation is verified, and the amount of the loan is approved, the applicant is notified to contact the office with 30% of the guarantee money. The syndicate will send personnel with the money to collect the cocoons. The collected cocoons will be stored in a warehouse designated by the syndicate. If there is no syndicate bank warehouse nearby that can be used, the cocoons will be stored in the factory and supervised by syndicate personnel. It is said that cocoon registration in Zhejiang Province has already been completed, so loans can be released around the 20th, once the office is established.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Merchants' Association Decides to Resume Exchange Yesterday Evening</h3>
<p>Date of Resumption to be Determined at Today's Meeting</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu Reports on the Petitioning Process in Anhui</p>
<p>Due to the Anhui Province's Monopoly on Qi Hong Tea, the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association held a meeting at 7:30 PM yesterday evening and decided to resume exchange. The exact date will be decided at the 2:00 PM meeting today. Qian Chengxu, a representative of the National Federation of Commerce and other petitioning organizations, reported on his trip to Nanjing and Anhui. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Approves Request from Foreign Firms for Samples</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's reply stated: "A document was received concerning the illegal overreach of authority in Anhui Province's monopolized distribution of black tea, requesting examination and correction, or a proposal for its revocation, to alleviate merchant hardships and comply with regulations. The contents are understood. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Ministry regarding this matter. The Ministry has already telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to find a solution and provide a swift reply. You are hereby informed once the Provincial Government's response and handling are received."  The Baochang Foreign Firm wrote to the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association: "Respectfully, we have heard that shipments of red and green boxed tea are arriving, and some have already reached Shanghai. However, we have not seen any samples displayed by the tea houses. We are writing to kindly request that your association inform the tea houses to promptly send samples to our firm to facilitate trading. Your cooperation will be appreciated."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Another Petition for Negotiated Resolution</p>
<p>The Foreign Tea Merchants' Association again sent Chen Yizhou, Hong Mengpan, and others to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning to petition for another telegram to the Anhui provincial authorities to abolish the monopoly on Qihong tea to alleviate the hardships of merchants, and to discuss the means of opening exchange for promissory notes. They were received by Secretary Yan E'sheng. The Anhui Qihong Tea Marketing Office has decided to establish a general office in Shanghai. The director, Cheng Zhenji, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he indirectly negotiated with Chen Yizhou and others from the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association to resolve the disputes over the Qihong tea marketing route, which is close to resolution. After another round of consultations, there should be no problems.</p>
<p>Qian Reports on Petitioning Process</p>
<p>The China General Chamber of Industry and the National Federation of Commerce sent Qian Chengxu to Anhui to petition regarding the Anhui Province's monopoly on Qihong tea. Qian arrived in Anqing on the 29th of last month. At that time, he mediated between the opinions of Anhui Province on the monopoly of black tea and the Shanghai tea houses and suggested to the provincial government. After several consultations, an agreement was reached on the second day. The provincial government expressed acceptance of Qian's proposal for official-merchant cooperation and the establishment of a Chinese tea management organization and proposed three counter-proposals as the basis for future agreements. Qian took the Jianghua ship east on the third day, first to Nanjing, to present the mediation process to the Ministry of Industry, and then returned to Shanghai to report on it when the Ministry's attitude was determined.</p>
<p>Suggestions to Provincial Government Actually See Original Text</p>
<p>The original text of Qian Chengxu's suggestion is as follows: "As a representative of the China General Chamber of Industry and the National Federation of Commerce, I have come to your province to offer mediation on the issue of suspended exchange by Shanghai tea houses. My sole purpose is to exert a lateral force to break the deadlock and prevent the conflict from escalating and affecting tea-growing regions in other provinces. I also deeply feel that a national economic organization is a collection of multiple parts, breathing in unison for a healthy body. Regarding the issue of your province's control of tea production, I believe that improving quality, aiding farmers, and unifying production and sales are necessary. However, there are several processes in the commercial sector that must temporarily pass through merchants as a transition to achieve the direct goal of production and sales. I am also concerned about the impact on Chinese tea exports this year. For the benefit of both parties, I suggest that your government continue to advance the established tea production and marketing organization according to the original plan. For foreign trade, the existing tea houses should be reorganized into Chinese tea management organizations under the supervision and guidance of the government. I consulted the Ministry of Industry on this and they found it appropriate and feasible. The Ministry has already telegraphed your provincial government for verification. My opinions are listed below. Tea house merchants are more suitable for promotion due to their experience and past foreign trade relations. I propose that officials and merchants jointly establish a Chinese tea business company with a fixed capital of 3 million yuan, with merchants investing 2 million yuan and the government 1 million yuan. The company's business includes purchasing tea leaves and promoting sales at home and abroad. A general management office should be established above the company, using a committee system with five to seven members as the chairman of the committee. The general manager of the company shall be selected by the committee from the merchant shareholders (i.e., non-merchant shareholders shall not serve as general manager). In the current situation, the Qimen black tea under the control of your provincial government has resulted in the simultaneous suspension of green tea exchange. Your provincial government has its own views on the future development and handling of the situation, which I will not express. However, as a suggestion, if your provincial government intends to accept the above principles, I will do my best to mediate and promote its realization and resolve the issue of tea merchants suspending exchange." The Anhui Provincial Government added three principles to Qian's proposal, including: "If the Ministry of Industry has an overall plan for the Chinese tea trading company and is responsible for it, our province will accept it. Our province's handling of black tea marketing this year only aims to reduce loan interest rates, reduce tea tax rates, eliminate the tea houses' past bad practices towards tea companies, and seek convenience and safety in transportation. Further improvements will be made to rationalize production and sales. Regarding the tea houses' suspension of green tea loans, Director Zhao Lanping of the National Economic Commission is responsible for mediation. If the suspension continues after May 5, our province will seek other relief measures."</p>
<p>Exchange to Be Resumed per Last Night's Meeting Decision</p>
<p>The Foreign Tea Merchants Association held an emergency meeting at its Gujialong location at 7:30 PM yesterday.

After a long discussion, it was decided on the spot to accept the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's recommendation and resume exchange first. The date will be decided at the meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The meeting adjourned at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association's New Clubhouse to Hold Completion Ceremony Today</h3>

The public concession and the French concession police authorities also have the same security arrangements.</p>
<h3>Investigation into the Truth of Smuggling in North China Concluded, Rhodes Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Immediately Met with Finance Minister Kong, Song Ziwen Was Also Present</p>
<p>Telegraphed the British Government Reporting That the Date of Return Home Is Undecided</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the special economic commissioner sent by the British government to China, went north again, to Pingjin, to investigate the truth about smuggling in North China and its impact on British rights. Now that the matter is completed, he and his wife took a car south from Ping on the second, passed through Beijing the night before yesterday without stopping, and returned directly to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 7:50 yesterday morning. His assistant, Ba Zhijun, went to the station to meet him. After Rhodes got off the train, he went to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. Then, at 11:45, he went to the Central Bank to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, and Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission and chairman of the Bank of China, was also present. Rhodes described the investigation process of his trip and discussed it. It took an hour before he left. It is learned that in addition to reporting the investigation process to Finance Minister Kong, Rhodes telegraphed his home government, because his government is now paying close attention to this matter, and his trip to the north to investigate was already under orders. According to Rhodes' assistant, Ba Zhongjun, the date of their departure from China and return home has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Shanghai News on the 4th, Reuters was entrusted to announce that the British government's economic adviser, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, recently discussed the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Railway construction cost agreement during his recent trip to North China. This statement has no basis.</p>
<h3>Head of the German Economic Investigation Mission, Dr. Krup, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>I Admit to Having Signed the German-Puppet Commerce Agreement</p>
<p>Said It Was Just an Informal Commercial Instrument</p>
<p>Dr. Krup, the head of the German Far East Economic Investigation Mission, came to China again from Japan and arrived in Shanghai on the President Monroe wheel of the Da Lai Company at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Krup admitted that he had signed the so-called "German-Puppet Commerce Agreement." The following are the details of his arrival in Shanghai and his speech:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The wheel was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 PM, but it was delayed until 3:00 PM. It berthed at the Da Lai Pier in Bailianjing, Pudong. Mr. Krup's decision to come to China from Japan was very secret, and even his wife did not come with him. His name was not listed in the passenger list of the President Monroe wheel. The reporter from Xinsheng News Agency searched everywhere without success. Later, he met Ge Linfu, the president of the German News Agency, who came to meet him, and he was introduced to meet him. After getting off the wheel, Mr. Krup changed to a small passenger wheel to cross the Pu, and landed at the New Customs Pier at 4:00 PM. He first went to the German Consulate on Huangpu Road to rest. Mr. Krup's visit here will last a considerable amount of time, and he will go to Beijing to pay respects to our authorities to explain everything. The rumor that Mr. Krup will take the original wheel back to Europe this morning is untrue.</p>
<p>Krup's Speech</p>
<p>According to Mr. Krup, who spoke to reporters on the wheel, the report that I signed the "German-Puppet Commerce Agreement" in Japan is not true. The report is probably a mistake of an informal commercial arrangement, not any agreement or article. This is all about the exchange rate relationship and has no political meaning. There is no suspicion of recognizing the puppet Manchukuo, and I am not a government official in active service. I have been out of the official circle for three years. This decision is only to serve as the head of the Far East Economic Investigation Mission in my private capacity, in order to promote the trade relationship between Germany and the Far East. After arriving in Shanghai, it is still uncertain how long he will stay in Shanghai and when he will go to Beijing. In the future, he will return to his country via Siam, but the trip is also undecided.</p>
<h3>Founding of Puyi Oil Company to Collect Sichuan Province Oil</h3>
<p>Seeking Support from All Parties</p>
<p>Lay the Foundation for National Oil</p>
<p>Yu Shunqing, the standing committee member of the National Media Production and Sales Joint Association of this city, recently discovered that the salt wells in Sichuan Province contain raw media oil. After the chemical test results of the Industrialization Laboratory of the Municipal Social Bureau, it is divided into gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, and lubricating oil, and the quality is excellent and surpasses that of foreign products. In order to meet the needs of society and prevent leaks, Puyi Oil Company was specially organized in conjunction with political and business leaders Li Dachao, Yu Qiaqing, and Lin Kanghou. On the one hand, letters were sent to various sectors to solicit support and jointly promote it. The original letter said, "Sir, Shunqing has seen that national defense is important, and the two items of coal oil are of utmost importance. Therefore, since the Republic of China for twenty-two years, the number of decisions to enter Sichuan to investigate the national coal production. Cheng Lu Zuofu, director, Xiang Yuren, director, and Ba County Tang Diancheng County Magistrate issued passports to go to various counties in Sichuan Province to investigate the two items of coal oil. When it comes to Zigong, the Chamber of Commerce reports that gasoline and black oil are often found in the salt wells in the area, and the taste is very smelly. Those who know it are the original quality of coal oil. Because there is no way to test it, it is discarded at any time. Shunqing will install the black oil into eight oil drums and bring it with him to Shanghai. Immediately after asking the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's Industrial Chemical Laboratory to test the results, it is divided into gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, and lubricating oil. In July of that year, Director Lu Zuofu came to Shanghai on official business. Shunqing invited Shanghai tycoon Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Sheng Pihua, Li Zushen, Zhang Zilian, Zhou Xiangsheng, and other gentlemen to a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant. All four types of oil that had been chemically tested were offered to the public, and everyone praised them extremely, saying that this was the foundation of domestically produced gasoline. Last year, Director Lu Zuofu returned to Shanghai, and Shunqing sent the chemically tested oil to Director Lu to take to Sichuan and store it in the Construction Department to indicate the textual research of the national oil sample. Now national defense is very important. Mayor Wu and others initiated the Aviation Save the Country Association. What is missing is the gasoline needed by the aircraft. I think gentlemen, all of you are famous figures in the Party and the country, and your love for the country will not be behind others. Please pay extremely attention so that the gasoline needed for aviation will not be supplied by foreign products. Mr. Fuqing will make a call to promote the establishment of a national oil organization and a public petroleum investigation team to actively prepare. However, the oil areas in our country, such as Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Xikang, and Sichuan, have a wide distribution of oil seedlings. After the survey is obtained, there will be a considerable amount of oil, and the Aviation Association will be notified and cooperate to proceed. This is to inform you, and I hope you will guide us."</p>

<h3>Due to Smuggling and Other Relations, Nanhua Shipping Declines Sharply</h3>
<p>Smuggled Sugar Floods, Domestic Sugar Becomes Stagnant</p>
<p>Currency Value Differences, Commerce Depressed</p>
<p>Minnan Shipping Becomes Abnormal, Japanese Ships Increase Uniquely</p>
<p>Nanhua's shipping between Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Fujian, and other ports has always been very prosperous. In the past two months, the situation has changed drastically and has declined sharply. The fundamental main reason is the flooding of smuggled goods in North China, which has affected freight in South China. Shipping lines in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, have suffered major blows. The detailed details of this matter are described as follows:</p>
<p>Smuggled Sugar Affects Domestic Sugar</p>
<p>Guangdong sugar sells well in Shanghai and also sells to ports along the Yangtze River. Because it is tax-free when imported, it is cheaper than foreign sugar. Therefore, Guangdong sugar has occupied a very large force in Shanghai. Four factories in Guangdong are rushing to produce it, and large quantities are shipped from Shantou to Shanghai. In the past two months, due to smuggling in North China, tax-free sugar has been sold privately to Shanghai and ports along the Yangtze River. According to the investigation results, the price of smuggled sugar is below 14 yuan per dan. Guangdong sugar was first sold for 21 yuan, then fell to 19 yuan, and recently decreased by 2 yuan, but it is still not as cheap as smuggled sugar. As a result, Guangdong sugar arrives in Shanghai and is piled up in countless quantities. The China Merchants Bureau alone transports it, and the sugar piled up in the southern warehouse is already difficult to accommodate. In the past half month, Guangdong sugar shipped from Shantou has been changed to unloading in the northern warehouse. The more storage, the more backlog, and the more stagnant the sales. In the past week, Guangdong has implemented a reduction in sugar shipped to Shanghai. Moreover, due to the fundamental impact of smuggling on sales, the number of shipments in North China and Central China has fallen sharply. Therefore, two factories have stopped. Starting from the end of this month, Guangdong sugar will temporarily stop being shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Currency System Changes Commerce</p>
<p>Guangdong used to use Hao Yang as the unit. The purchase of Shanghai goods has always been calculated in cooperation with the Shanghai ocean according to the Hao Yang market price, roughly increasing by more than 20% according to the declared price. Now Guangdong Province is also following the central government's new system to reform the circulating Hao Yang and adopt the legal currency system. During this transition period, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Guangdong has invisibly changed in a new way. One yuan of Shanghai legal currency is worth 1.5 yuan of Guangdong legal currency. Due to the transformation of the currency system, the transportation of goods from Shanghai to Guangdong must be invisibly increased by 25% compared with the previous one. However, although the cost is high, it is still difficult to increase the price after being sold in Guangdong. The Guangdong gang is concerned about the blood capital, and except for the necessary goods that have to be considered for handling, other goods (Shanghai's goods transported to Guangdong include yarn cloth, textiles, cigarettes, grains, sundries, and foreign sundries) are all holding a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sudden sharp decline in the number of goods transported from Shanghai to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong, a decrease of almost 40%. Nanhua's shipping industry of various Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai has been severely affected. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and others still have a part of transshipment goods. The China Merchants Bureau's Nanhua liner due to poor business in this way, only four new liners were changed to one flight per week, and four to five fewer flights per month. This is also a major depression in the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Fujian Wheel Also Lacks Energy</p>
<p>Although the Minnan Construction Department has dredged Hanjiang this year, and Nantai can pass seagoing vessels, the Shanghai-Fuzhou route has also declined because Japanese goods sell well and domestic goods in Fujian are suppressed, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is open to traffic. , the goods transported to the border between Minnan and Jiangxi are transported by car, resulting in a decline in the number of goods loaded from Shanghai into Fuzhou. The new inscriptions of the China Merchants' Shanghai-Fujian wheel have been changed to sail in Beiyang, and the Wanhong of Sanbei has been changed to sail in the Yangtze River. The Jing'an wheel traveling between Shanghai and Fujian can only load 20% to 30% of its feet. During this depression, the number of Japanese ships sailing from Shanghai to Fuzhou has increased from three to six. It is not difficult to find out the reason.</p>

<p>Kong Xianxi, Zou Lin, Liu Ruiheng, Zeng Rongfu, and Liu Weichi took the overnight train from Shanghai to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Telephone Meeting to Regularly Convene Various Groups: Joint Telephone Conference</h3>
<p>Discussing Sound Organization to Seek Vigorous Resistance</p>
<p>Recommending Proper Methods to Write to Chinese Directors for Negotiation</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee of this city, in order to enrich its organization and resolutely resist the new telephone system, has decided to convene a joint conference of various influential public groups in the concession area on the eighth of this month at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss methods. The committee also sent a letter to the Chinese directors attending the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting them to raise serious concerns with the Municipal Council. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Regularly Scheduled Meetings to Discuss Methods</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the First and Second Special District Citizens' Federation, the Bankers' Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Joint Association of Brokers of the Five Exchanges, and the Guangdong, Ningbo, Pudong, and other fellow-provincial associations, stating: "Since the implementation of the new special district telephone system, users in various districts have risen up in protest. At a time when the market is declining and commerce is sluggish, we are already feeling the hardship of 'living in Shanghai is not easy.' How can we bear to add an unexpected burden on top of tightening our belts and勉維殘局 (struggling to maintain the remaining situation)? Upon investigation, the Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding social economics, has even been found to have inflated the final account. If we do not deal with it, then in the future, everything for us citizens of the special district will be at its disposal. The crisis ahead is unimaginable. In order to strive permanently and seek a solution, we have decided to convene a joint conference of various groups in the special district at 3:00 PM on Friday, the eighth of this month, at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Palace Bridge, to discuss a unified stance. We are specially writing to your association, requesting you to send two representatives to attend and participate in the discussion. The committee also notified all executive committee members and advisors to attend and discuss coping methods."</p>
<p>Letter to Chinese Directors Requesting Negotiation</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was also sent to the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, Xi Yushu, etc., stating: "The Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to satisfy its desire for a one-tenth official profit, has specially formulated new rules, which have been implemented since March 1 of this year. The fees are charged according to the number of calls made. Users throughout the city have repeatedly protested against this disguised price increase, but to no avail. Recently, users from various districts have reported to the committee that the company has inflated the final account and charged unexpected fees. Such unethical behavior is not allowed by law, reason, or human sentiment. In order to avoid being unreasonably victimized, users from various districts have risen up to refuse payment and allow their lines to be cut. Their loyalty and courage for the public good are commendable. However, Shanghai is a mixed Chinese and foreign city, and an important commercial port. If transportation is restricted, the future of commerce will be difficult to develop. Furthermore, in the event of fires, burglaries, or ambulance services, it will be impossible to transmit messages in a timely manner. We are specially writing to request your directors to prioritize the protection of the interests of the Chinese people and promptly raise serious concerns with the Municipal Council, and demand that:　The basic call allowance should be abolished, and all calls should be charged at a rate of three cents per call;　Residential telephones should have a minimum monthly usage of six yuan and fifty cents; Commercial telephones should have a minimum monthly usage of ten yuan; Each telephone should be equipped with a meter to ensure credibility; If the company's net profit exceeds ten percent, the price should be reduced immediately; If the company still cannot accept the above minimum requirements, the Municipal Council should immediately cancel its business license and solicit new investors, or the state should estimate and purchase it. We believe that all directors, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the city's taxpayers, will be able to uphold public opinion and work hard to negotiate, thus satisfying the public's expectations."</p>
<h3>Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Feng Rui, Flies to Beijing This Morning</h3>
<p>To Visit Central Authorities and Report on Everything</p>
<p>Feng Talks About the Authorities Having No Intention of Reducing Sugar Tax</p>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, arrived in Shanghai by plane on the first of this month. The following day, he visited Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to report on the progress of construction in Guangdong Province and the situation of Guangdong's national sugar revival. He also specifically addressed Kong regarding widespread rumors of a reduction in sugar tax, which would greatly affect the development of national sugar. Last night, according to Feng to a New News Agency reporter, he has been in contact with various parties in Shanghai for several days, and the results are extremely satisfactory. The authorities have always supported the development of Guangdong sugar and have no intention of reducing sugar tax. Sugar merchants can rest assured to do business. He has already completed his affairs in Shanghai and will fly to Beijing tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) to visit the central authorities and report on everything. He plans to stay in Beijing for a day or two before returning to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou to report back. At that time, Supervisor Tang (Hai'an) may accompany him. Wang Zhisheng of the China National Federation of Industries, in order to express his gratitude for Feng's hospitality when the federation's Guangdong-Guangxi inspection team went to Guangdong, will host a banquet for Feng. The banquet will be held after Feng returns to Shanghai. It is heard that Cai Shengbai, the head of the Guangdong-Guangxi inspection team, and the deputy heads Hu Xiyuan and Xiang Kangyuan, have invited Feng to visit the Meyer Silk Weaving Factory, the Yaboer Electric Appliance Factory, and the Kangyuan Canning Factory.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosted the New Life Movement Inspection Team Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Visited the City Center After Attending the Commemoration Week in the Morning</p>
<p>Assisting the Public Security Bureau in Promoting the New Life Movement to a Conclusion</p>
<p>The entire New Life Movement General Association inspection team, numbering over one hundred, went to the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday to participate in the Premier's Commemoration Week. Mayor Wu led the ceremony, and Jiang Juehua, the section chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, reported on his inspection of highways in Europe and the United States. The gist was that highways in Europe and the United States have developed extremely rapidly, and their construction is also very sophisticated, especially in England. However, the construction projects in England, the United States, and other countries are extremely sophisticated and costly, and are not very suitable for China. The projects in France and Germany are economical, and the effectiveness is considerable, which is enough for our country's method. There are still technical aspects, but due to time constraints, they have not been reported. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. Mayor Wu led a tour of the various bureaus under the Municipal Government, as well as the Municipal Library, Museum, and Sports Field. At 12:00 noon, Mayor Wu hosted a lunch for the team at the Municipal Government and invited the staff of the Municipal New Life Movement Association to accompany them. During the lunch, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating that the New Life Movement is of utmost importance to the revival of our country. The promotion of the New Life Movement must be divided into two aspects, one focusing on the spirit, which can also be called education, and the other focusing on the material. He hopes that the New Life Movement General Association inspection team will openly criticize and guide the city's New Life Movement work, and also hopes that those responsible for the city's New Life Movement will not work nervously because the General Association inspection team is in Shanghai, nor will they slack off after the inspection team leaves Shanghai. Finally, Deputy Team Leader Liu gave a reply, stating that although Shanghai has been affected by the January 28 Incident and the environment is different from the interior, the achievements in material construction and the efforts to promote the New Life Movement are all admirable. This is all a manifestation of the local authorities' willingness to take responsibility. He hopes that they will continue to work hard for the revival of the nation. The guests and hosts parted happily at 1:00 PM. In addition, over fifty inspectors stationed by the New Life Movement inspection team in various public security agencies to assist in promoting the New Life Movement have now concluded their work and have all withdrawn yesterday. The inspectors are currently drafting reports. Furthermore, since the team arrived in Shanghai, they have been working hard every day. Therefore, today is a holiday in commemoration of Premier Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as the Extraordinary President, and the inspectors will be free to visit Wusong and other places.</p>
<h3>Xiong Zhi Returned to China Yesterday, Talking About Child Welfare in Europe, America, and China</h3>
<p>All Countries Pay Great Attention to Child Welfare</p>
<p>Complete Facilities Can Be Modeled After Us</p>
<p>Ms. Xiong Zhi, a foreign inspector of the China Child Welfare Association, went abroad last September to inspect child welfare in various countries. After spending more than eight months in Europe and America, she has now completed her work and returned to Shanghai at 11:30 AM yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Chen Tiesheng, Chen Zhengfan, and Xiong Xiling, etc., the Director-General and staff of the China Child Welfare Association, all went to the wharf to welcome her. After disembarking, Ms. Xiong returned to her residence on Lafayette Road to rest. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency made a special visit to interview her, and she shared her observations on child welfare in Europe and America, which are recorded below. The China Child Welfare Association, in view of the rapid progress of child welfare in various countries and her own interest in child welfare, sent her to various countries for inspection on September 7 last year. She visited England, Italy, the United States, Germany, France, Russia, and other countries, and the facilities for child welfare can be divided as follows: Italy: She stayed in Italy for two months, visiting more than ten cities and visiting the Italian Mother and Child Protection Association, etc. Under the rule of Mussolini, Italy pays great attention to child welfare. General associations are set up in various cities, and branches are set up in rural areas, which are very common. United States, France, and England: The child welfare associations in these three countries are mostly funded by public fundraising. Children under the compulsory education age of seven are educated by nurseries, infant schools, and early childhood welfare associations, but there are also slight differences. Nurseries specialize in caring for infants under two years old, infant schools care for children aged two to four, and early childhood welfare associations care for children under seven years old. Russia: Child welfare in Russia is very developed because the government has assisted it with state power, so the results are particularly remarkable. Germany seems to be following Russia's trend. In short, she observed that all European and American countries attach great importance to the welfare of children and regard children as the future masters of the country. To seek the prosperity of the nation, we must first seek the welfare of children and provide them with appropriate education. She is currently sorting out materials and reporting to the China Child Welfare Association, and will bring back many new educational tools and toys for children for public exhibition, as a reference for improving China's emerging child welfare.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Salt Affairs Agencies in Lianghuai</h3>
<p>Huaihe and Huaibei Areas Merged into Lianghuai Area</p>
<p>Deputy Salt Transport Commissioner of Huainan Abolished, Salt Transport Commissioner Still Stationed in Guanyun</p>
<p>In order to reorganize salt affairs in Huaihe, the Ministry of Finance has decided to merge Huaihe and Huaibei into the Lianghuai area. The Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai will still be stationed in Guanyun, the Deputy Salt Transport Commissioner of Huainan will be abolished, and the Huaibei Salt Affairs Audit Branch will be renamed the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Audit Branch, with Yao Yuanlun, the current manager of the Huaibei Branch, serving as the manager of the Lianghuai Branch and concurrently as the Salt Transport Commissioner. The Yangzhou Accumulation Audit Branch will be reduced in scope and renamed a sub-branch, under the jurisdiction of the Lianghuai Branch, with Niu Jianxia as the director of the sub-branch. It is also heard that the salt sold in the four ports of Yangzi was originally supplied by the various fields in Huainan, and the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai was stationed in Jiangdu to preside over everything. Later, due to the eastward migration of the sea, the original salt kilns in Huainan were far from the sea, the salinity was weak, and the production was greatly reduced. In order to adjust supply and demand, new滩Huai salt production centers were added in Huaibei. The center of gravity shifted from south to north, and in 1931, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai was moved to Guanyun. The original Deputy Salt Transport Commissioner of Huaibei was renamed the Deputy Salt Transport Commissioner of Huainan and moved to Jiangdu. Now, a further step has been taken to unite the salt administration of Lianghuai into one area.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team, Ministry of Industry Subsidizes 15,000 Yuan</h3>

Those who wish to join can contact the association. The deadline for participation is May 15, and samples must be prepared by the end of May and sent to various ports for exhibition by the Zhaohua Company in advance. It is also learned that the association has requested the Ministry of Industry to allocate 15,000 yuan for expenses. Zhang Huikang, the chairman of the association, met with Minister Wu Dingchang yesterday, and Wu agreed to allocate the funds immediately. Recently, chambers of commerce in various parts of Nanyang have heard that a domestic goods group is promoting sales in Nanyang, which is unprecedented, and have sent letters inquiring about the itinerary, all intending to prepare a grand welcome and do their best to promote the products of the participating factories. Song Faxiang, the Consul-General in Batavia, also serves as the director of the China Tea Trade Promotion Association, so he will also assist the inspection team in its activities in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>American Warships Sail to Qingdao</h3>
<p>To Hold Annual Exercises</p>
<p>Many warships from various countries have arrived in the Huangpu River, but since yesterday, they have begun to leave Shanghai. The first batch was the American warship Carroll Popes and four submarines, which sailed to Qingdao at 1:30 PM yesterday for summer exercises. An hour later, another American warship, Tulsa, also sailed to Qingdao. The US Asiatic Fleet and other warships that have arrived in Shanghai from Manila will gradually head north in the coming days to participate in the annual exercises. The British warships stationed in the Huangpu River will also depart successively.</p>
<h3>Municipal Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council to Compensate for Those Killed by Stray Bullets</h3>
<p>Because Most Pedestrian Streets are for the Working Class</p>
<p>Once a Family Member is Killed or Injured, the Family Loses its Support</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from citizen Zhou Qifan, Chinese people seek refuge in the concession, believing it to be safe and reliable. However, in recent years, theft cases have occurred repeatedly, and stray bullets have injured and killed pedestrians, which is not uncommon. The danger is imminent, and life is at stake. Commentators say that this is caused by inaccurate shooting by detectives chasing bandits. Although shooting to apprehend bandits is necessary given the circumstances, injuring and killing passersby is also tolerated by law. However, those who are injured and killed by stray bullets are innocent victims. From a moral standpoint, even if it is difficult to appeal to the law, the Municipal Council of the Concession cannot sit idly by without providing appropriate compensation to the deceased and injured. Moreover, most pedestrian streets are for the working class who are directly involved in production. Once a family member is killed or injured, the family loses its support. Everyone has the same heart, how can this be tolerated? Furthermore, the Public Concession Municipal Council spends over ten million yuan a year as security expenses for the police, which is considerable. However, robbery cases occur repeatedly and are heard of daily. Bandits are as rampant as ever. If the tiger and rhinoceros escape from the cage and the tortoise and jade are destroyed in the coffin, whose fault is it? The concession is leased territory of our country, and most of the revenue comes from Chinese taxes. The weakness of security guarantees has reached this point. Since the Municipal Council does not hesitate to spend high salaries to support useless people, it should provide generous compensation to those who are innocently killed or injured by stray bullets during bandit hunts to comfort the families of the deceased and prevent them from freezing and starving. Human sentiment and law should be balanced. In addition to separately writing to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession to earnestly negotiate with the Municipal Council and request that in the event of the above situation, compensation should be determined according to the severity of the injury, we are correspondingly writing to your association to uphold justice and unanimously negotiate with the Municipal Council to achieve this goal. It is our duty to do so, and we hope that you will review and reply." The matter was submitted to the first joint meeting of the fifth session of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion, and it was believed that the above-mentioned matters were indeed true. Accordingly, a letter was sent to your bureau, requesting that compensation should be provided for those who are injured and killed by stray bullets during robbery cases, etc., in order to maintain human sentiment and fairness.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loan Spring Loans to Begin</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Agricultural Loan Group organized by the banking industry in this city has achieved good results since its establishment. The 24th year has now been fully completed, and the loans of 1.8 million yuan have been recovered with principal and interest. The banking group is satisfied and will continue to operate. According to reporters, the spring loans for the 25th year will begin soon, and all methods will be the same as the previous session. As for the rumor that the group will increase the amount of loans, the person in charge said that the group's loans are shared by various cooperative banks, and meetings are convened for each loan, so it can be decided at any time. It is also rumored that the group will stop operating after the establishment of the Agricultural Bank, but the spokesperson said that the work of the Agricultural Bank and the loan group is different. After the establishment of the bank, the loan group will continue to operate.</p>
<h3>Ice Fresh Fish Industry Association Telegraphed Finance Minister Kong Requesting Correction of Fish Market Regulations</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Ice Fresh Fish Industry Association of this city telegraphed Finance Minister Kong regarding the fish market regulations, stating: "To Minister Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, we humbly submit that yesterday's Shen Bao newspaper column revealed news of the Shanghai Fish Market Joint Stock Company, item B of the discussion and resolution items, stating that this association notified the Ministry of Finance that from the afternoon of May 10, fish cargo ships from all ports must all dock at the fish market for transactions, etc., and a letter was sent to the association, the matter being the same as before. The association convened an industry meeting at 1:00 PM on May 2, and unanimously agreed that the fish market and the fish firms are both intermediaries and should strictly abide by the boundaries and operate in their respective industries. Article 3 of the company's articles of association states that 'after the opening of this market, no business of the same or similar nature may be conducted within the Shanghai area.' However, the articles of association of a joint stock company cannot restrict the resolutions of third parties in the record. The fish market resolved that fish cargo ships from all ports must all dock at the fish market for transactions, which means detaining ships for delivery. However, detaining ships for delivery is the authority of the customs, which is applied to those who violate laws, evade taxes, or transport contraband. Now, the fish market does not know that it is a joint stock company and wants to use its own articles of association to bind the business of others. Therefore, there is a resolution to notify the Ministry of Finance. We are afraid that your department will be deceived by it and grant its request, which will cause difficulties for the members of the association and the fishermen. We must urgently present the reasons and telegraph to your lord for investigation. We humbly beg you to consider that our industry is facing difficulties under the attack of the economic downturn, and the situation is self-evident. The request of the Shanghai Fish Market to detain ships for delivery should be rejected, which is both in the public interest. Respectfully submitted, the Ice Fresh Fish Industry Association of Shanghai kowtows, winter."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fish Market Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Part of the Ice Fresh Fish Industry</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng Urged Cooperation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry, established by official and commercial joint investment, has a board of directors and appointed managers, and is actively preparing. It is scheduled to open on the eleventh and start business on the twelfth. However, twelve firms, including Ganfeng, Shengji, and Gongda, which are part of the Ice Fresh Fish Industry and were originally members of the Industry Association but did not subscribe to shares, published a public notice yesterday, stating that they will continue to operate at their original address at 16 Xiaodongmen. This conflicts with the articles of association of the fish market, which stipulate that similar organizations may not exist in the future. It is learned that Chairman Du Yuesheng is now urging and persuading the fish firms to participate in cooperation in order to concentrate business in the new market. As for the market brokers, the quota is 40, and registration has begun. The market staff has also been assigned and are actively preparing, and it is hoped that the opening will be on schedule.</p>

Zhang and others will land in Osaka and transfer to Kobe, Tokyo, and other places for a month before returning to China, using the results of their study as a reference.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Instructs the Li Jiao United Association to Temporarily Suspend the Organization of Branches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters instructed the Li Jiao United Association, stating: "Regarding compliance matters, according to Public Letter No. 1291 from the Mass Training Department of the Central Executive Committee, upon investigation of the received documents, the former Mass Movement Guidance Committee sent letters to the Party Headquarters of various provinces and cities between July and August of last year, requesting that the Li Jiao organizations in each province and city be reorganized in accordance with the law, and sent a simple charter of the provincial, municipal, and county branches of the China Li Jiao General Association, requesting that they be instructed to comply. The department plans to adjust the Li Jiao organizations in Shanghai and ordered the China Li Jiao General Association last month to temporarily suspend the organization of branches in various places. In addition to sending separate letters, we are correspondingly sending this letter requesting that you comply, forward the instructions to the Li Jiao public offices, temporarily suspend the organization of branches to avoid disputes, and must not deviate from this order."</p>

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Arranges Free Cholera Vaccinations at Various Hospitals</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Begin on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>And Prepares to Expand Epidemic Prevention Publicity</p>
<p>According to predictions by numerous medical experts, this year is expected to be a year of epidemic prevalence. Therefore, the Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent cholera early and eradicate the epidemic, has specifically arranged, starting from the 15th of this month, to entrust 28 hospitals and clinics throughout the city to provide free vaccinations. They are also preparing to conduct expanded epidemic prevention publicity. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Extensive Publicity</p>
<p>Since the cholera outbreak in Shanghai in 1932, the city's health authorities have worked hard to eradicate it, preventing the epidemic from spreading. This year marks the fourth anniversary. According to predictions by numerous experts, this year's epidemic is bound to be more serious than in previous years. Therefore, the Municipal Health Bureau, in order to ensure the safety of citizens' lives, is implementing preventive measures in advance, regularly convening meetings of various health agencies to discuss epidemic prevention, and preparing for city-wide expanded publicity to raise public awareness.</p>
<p>Free Vaccinations</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has issued a notice to all citizens regarding free cholera vaccinations, stating that in order to prevent cholera and protect the health of citizens, the bureau will begin providing free cholera vaccinations from the 15th of this month.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Seeks Opinions on Establishing an Agricultural Capital Bureau</h3>
<p>Deadline for Submission is the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>Various Banks in the City are Currently Studying the Proposal Separately</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang convened a meeting of the financial community on the 2nd to discuss the establishment of the Agricultural Capital Bureau. It was decided that the capital would be divided into a fixed capital of 30 million yuan, allocated by the government; a working capital of 30 million yuan, to be borne by participating banks at 6 million yuan per year, payable in five years; and a revolving fund of an indefinite amount, to be supplied by participating banks through negotiation. After the organizational outline was approved, and in order to gather diverse perspectives, the Ministry is continuing to solicit opinions from various banks on the Agricultural Capital Bureau. These opinions must be submitted in writing to the Shanghai Banking Association by the 15th of this month, and the Association will then compile and forward them to the Ministry of Industry for reference. A second meeting is planned to be convened for detailed study, after which the capital will be paid in, and the Bureau is expected to be formally established on July 1st. The head office will be located in Nanjing, with branch offices established in important locations such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin. Commissioners will be stationed in various counties to handle all matters.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Industry Requesting Postponement of Animal Hide Inspection</h3>
<p>Strict Attention Should be Paid During Hunting Season</p>
<p>Inspection Should Not be Implemented on Traded Finished Products</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, stating that on the 2nd of this month, the City's Fur, Oil, and Bone Trade Association sent a letter stating that the Association had previously received from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Fur Inspection" and had been solicited for opinions. The Association believed that fur</p>
<p>Conditions are Unique</p>
<p>And its types are complex. Implementing inspection would encounter many obstacles. On October 7, 1935, the Association submitted a report outlining the difficulties to the Ministry, requesting exemption from implementation. Unexpectedly, on April 24, a letter was received from the Commodity Inspection Bureau stating, "This Bureau is preparing for fur inspection and convened a meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd of this month, inviting representatives of your Association, Lu [name] and Yuan [name], to attend. Mr. Lu and others requested consideration of the commercial situation and suggested that, except for large-volume exports of domestic rabbit skins, wild rabbit skins, lambskins, and [hide type] skins, inspection should be temporarily waived for other furs. As for inspection fees, it was agreed that domestic rabbits would be charged 10 cents per hundred skins, wild rabbit skins 5 cents per hundred skins, lambskins 1 cent per skin, and [hide type] skins 43 cents per metric ton. The decision was accepted and will be reported to the Ministry.</p>
<p>Scheduled Inspection</p>
<p>We hereby request you to take note. If your Association has any opinions on the grading standards for the inspection of the aforementioned skins in the previously sent draft of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Fur Inspection, please inform us immediately for reference. This matter concerns inspection policy, and we hope your Association will assist in its implementation." This was deeply alarming. The Association had not received any notice from the Bureau to convene a meeting beforehand, nor had it designated any members as attending representatives. According to the two gentlemen themselves, they did not attend the meeting under official Association mandate, but merely attended the Bureau for discussions in their private capacities. The Association contacted Mr. Lu and Mr. Yuan separately to seek confirmation. The Association believes that it is currently outlining the difficulties of the Bureau's inspection and appealing for its suspension. However, the Bureau used the attendance of Mr. Lu and Mr. Yuan as</p>
<p>A Pretext for Attending the Meeting</p>
<p>If the Bureau held a formal meeting, why was no notice given beforehand? Furthermore, there were no records of the event. How can such a major event be confirmed without written documentation? Should representatives not have credentials to verify their full authority to attend? Such procedures are simple even in regular meetings, let alone in a decision made by inspection authorities concerning a professional association on a major event. This is something that the Association cannot accept. Furthermore, the promotion of inspection policy is a painstaking effort on the part of the authorities, and we dare not criticize it. However, examining the practices of various countries in the East and West, there are no regulations for the inspection of exported animal hides. Instead, they are tax-exempt to encourage export, as they are used to manufacture luxury decorative items. Therefore, exports are encouraged, and fundamental improvements are made to the materials themselves</p>
<p>To Increase Production</p>
<p>If rural producing areas regulate hunting seasons, compel hunters to register, and provide guidance, with severe penalties for those who hunt out of season or illegally, the materials can be gradually improved. Alternatively, rewards can be offered for raising and strictly protecting animals, and mechanical methods can be used for hunting to avoid injury, with the aim of gradually increasing production. Looking back at our country's hunters, they adhere to traditional methods, killing animals at any time, resulting in hidden scars and affecting their usefulness. Even after the start of spring in the lunar calendar, during the breeding season for animals, mothers and their offspring are harmed, leading to a gradual decline in production. During the years 1933-1934, exports of [hide type] skins, such as yellow weasels, reached over 3 million, but recently only exceeded 1 million. Exports of rubber skins reached 200,000-300,000, but recently did not reach 100,000. From this, it can be seen that various countries focus on fundamental remedies, so materials are good and production is abundant. Our country, on the other hand,</p>
<p>Inspects Goods That Have Already Been Traded</p>
<p>This is putting the cart before the horse and is bound to cause disputes between buyers and sellers. We fear that it will not achieve results but will instead cause harm. We do not believe that this was the initial intention of the Ministry of Industry to support hide merchants. The Association believes that if inspection is indeed implemented, it will be deeply painful and difficult to endure in silence. Therefore, we are reiterating our difficulties and humbly request that the Ministry consider the hardships of merchants and suspend the implementation of animal hide inspection. The Association received the letter at the meeting. Based on this, regarding the matter of animal hide inspection, the Association expressed dissent in a letter from the trade association on October 8 of last year. We telegraphed the Ministry, Commercial Word No. 38698, requesting the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to investigate and respond before further notification. Now, according to the association's follow-up letter,</p>
<p>Improving Animal Hides</p>
<p>Should focus on strict attention during hunting season and should not be inspected when finished products are traded, as this would hinder the progress of trade. The statement is not without reason. Furthermore, when the Commodity Inspection Bureau convened a meeting to implement inspection, it did not formally invite the trade association to designate representatives to attend. Instead, it used Mr. Lu and Mr. Yuan from the industry as tools for making decisions, resulting in a decision that was not agreed to by the entire trade. The handling of the matter was also not properly done. We hereby report the situation and humbly request that the Ministry review and approve an order for the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to postpone the implementation of animal hide inspection, to subtly inquire about the opinions of the entire trade, to carefully review the matter in the long term, to facilitate inspection policy, and to serve the public interest. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.</p>

<h3>Ren Lianchang of the New Village Construction Society Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>The China New Village Construction Society, located at No. 918 Edward Road, was founded by Zhang Yongnian from Cixi, who hired Ren Lianchang from Zhuji, Zhejiang, as the director of the business department. On August 1 of last year, Zhang went to the Dutch East Indies (Java) for business. When he returned to Shanghai on September 28, he discovered discrepancies in the accounts. He hired accountant Sun Zhongyao to audit the accounts. Accountant Sun found that Ren Lianchang had taken advantage of his position to embezzle public funds amounting to 3,593.88 yuan. After receiving the report, Zhang Yongnian reported the matter to the Chengdu Road Patrol, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. Zhang Yongnian then filed a public lawsuit against Ren Lianchang in the First Special Court, accusing him of embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Law. The Special Court issued a summons for Ren Lianchang. However, after learning of the accusation, Ren Lianchang also hired a lawyer to file a countersuit against Zhang Yongnian in the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing him of false accusation. The court has already held one hearing on the false accusation case. However, because there was a prior public lawsuit for embezzlement, the court ruled to temporarily suspend the trial of the false accusation case. Yesterday morning, Judge Tan Xinzhen took the bench in the Eighth Criminal Court to hear the public lawsuit for embezzlement. The defendant, Ren Lianchang, arrived with his defense attorney, Dai Jien, as summoned. Patrol lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that according to accountant Sun's report, it was discovered that the defendant had secretly used the funds submitted by the client Mei Hanqi, as well as the salary paid on behalf of Zhang Yongnian. Furthermore, the defendant paid for the repair of his personal car and the expenses of the "Commander's Office" from the construction society's accounts. In this way, the defendant embezzled a total of 3,593.88 yuan. After Judge Tan questioned the victim, Zhang Yongnian, and the defendant, Ren Lianchang, he ordered a new hearing to be held on the 11th of this month. The defendant, Ren Lianchang, was ordered to provide a surety of 3,600 yuan. Before the surety was provided, his defense attorney, Dai Jien, was allowed to be responsible for his release.</p>
<h3>Chongming Native Zhang Sanlang Stabbed by Enemy</h3>
<p>Zhang Sanlang, a 41-year-old native of Chongming, makes his living by operating a coal barge. The barge was moored under the bridge on Donghan Road. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, Zhang Sanlang went ashore from the barge, intending to visit friends at the boatmen's tea party in Nanshi. As he was passing the intersection of Disiwei Road, a man in his thirties crept up behind him and, without explanation, drew a sharp blade and stabbed Zhang Sanlang in the waist. He then turned and fled. Zhang Sanlang, in great pain, turned around and saw that the assailant had fled dozens of paces away. He could not catch up, and blood was flowing from his wound. Fortunately, other boatmen noticed and quickly reported the incident to the police post, who took him to the hospital for treatment. They are now investigating the cause of the incident. According to Zhang, the assailant's name is Yu Xiaoting, a native of Chongming. Three years ago, he was a clerk on Zhang's boat, but was dismissed for some reason. This may have caused resentment, leading to this vicious act. The police are currently pursuing the suspect.</p>
<h3>Guest at the Da Jiangnan Hotel Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>A man, claiming to be Zhou Yifei, 23 years old, from this area, arrived at the Da Jiangnan Hotel at No. [address] on Fujian Road at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, seeking accommodation. The hotel provided him with Room 355. He slept peacefully overnight without incident. Unexpectedly, at around noon yesterday, the hotel waiter went to knock on the door to ask if he wanted to continue using the room, and heard moaning sounds coming from inside. He was greatly surprised and opened the door to investigate. He saw the man lying on his side next to the bed, his face pale and his breathing weak, on the verge of death. An empty box of poison was left next to the pillow. Knowing that he had attempted suicide, the waiter quickly reported the incident to the police post, who dispatched a car to rush him to the hospital for treatment. Due to severe poisoning, his condition is critical. The police are currently investigating his family.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchant Zhang Zihe Wanted by Police</h3>
<p>Because he was Accused of Abandonment by Madam Mao Zhiqing</p>
<p>The Special Court Repeatedly Summoned Him Without Success, so a Warrant Was Issued</p>
<p>Madam Mao Zhiqing, a 31-year-old woman from Zhenjiang, hired lawyer Yang Huchen in October of last year to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court, accusing Zhang Zihe, a silk merchant from Huzhou, of offenses against public morals and abandonment. The First Special Court repeatedly convened hearings, but the defendant never appeared, nor did any lawyer appear on his behalf. The judge presiding over the case was about to issue an arrest warrant when the defendant suddenly filed a countersuit, stating that when the plaintiff accused him, the defendant had submitted a statement defending himself. Therefore, the arrest warrant was put on hold. However, on the day of the scheduled hearing, the defendant still did not appear, and the judge searched the court records and found that the defendant had not submitted any statement of defense at the time. The judge, realizing that the defendant had repeatedly deceived the court, was extremely angry. On the day of the previous scheduled hearing, the defendant still did not appear. The plaintiff requested that a warrant be issued to arrest the defendant Zhang Zihe and bring him to court for questioning. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3>Four Robbery Cases Sentence Two to Five Years in Prison</h3>

The thieves broke into the residences and stole property worth 235 yuan, using toy pistols to threaten them into silence. The victims reported the incidents to the Huishan Patrol, and Chinese Detective Zhou Guisheng and Detective Shen Binkui arrested the two robbers, Liu Guibao from Ningbo and Lu Genbao from Jiangbei. A toy pistol was found and the suspects were sent to the First Special Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, the patrol sent the two suspects to the Third Criminal Court. 工部局 lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and requested punishment. Victims Chen Yuan and others testified about the robbery, and when questioned, Liu and Lu gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiebin obtained clear confessions and sentenced Liu Zhibao and Lu Genbao to five years imprisonment each. The toy pistol was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Bicycle Theft and Dancing: Rogue Teenager Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Probation Granted for Three Years</p>
<p>Bao Yulin, a Suzhou youth residing at No. 296 Pushi Road, is only eighteen years old. His father runs a gold business and has some assets, but Bao does not engage in honest work. He is constantly immersed in dance halls, resulting in heavy debt and unsustainable circumstances. On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, around 7 PM, he used fraudulent means to swindle a bicycle from the Lin Ji Bicycle Shop at No. 556 Dagu Road and pawned it at Jiaxing Pawnshop on Wusong Road for ten silver dollars. He showed no remorse and went to the Dahua Dance Research Institute at No. 2, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road, every night to dance. The Lin Ji Bicycle Shop reported this to the Zongzhu and the Chengdu Road Police Station ordered detective Zhang Peilan to arrest Bao at the Dahua Dance Hall. The police station lawyer, Qian Koujiu, prosecuted him in accordance with the law at the First Special District Court. Yesterday, after the trial by Judge Ye Shengchao, Bao was sentenced to three months imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Jinjiang Court Seeking Relatives of Lost Girl</h3>
<p>The girl, Kong Shigeng, is thirteen years old and from Shanghu, Anhui Province. Her father's name is Kong Defu, and he makes a living carrying salt. Shigeng was sold by human traffickers four years ago and eventually sold to Xiamen. The local Public Security Bureau discovered her and sent her to the Jinjiang District Court in Fujian Province. It was learned that the girl's family is in Shanghai, so the Jinjiang District Court sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government to issue a search notice, hoping for a family reunion. If there are relatives, they can prepare documents such as a guarantor and go to claim her.</p>
<h3>Pudong Xingxing Rabbit Farm Suffers Large-Scale Theft of Breeding Rabbits</h3>
<p>Zhao Xingbo of Zhongxinhe Town, Nanhui County, Pudong, in order to promote industry, established the Xingxing Rabbit Farm in the eastern part of the town.

<h3>Yu Ruitang Drowns in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Yu Ruitang, a native of Ningbo, was thirty-four years old and worked on a ship. Recently, as his younger brother's wedding was approaching, his elderly mother urged him to quickly raise funds to meet the urgent need. Yu Ruitang, feeling that he could not disobey his mother's orders, but being in dire financial straits, had been running around trying to borrow from relatives and friends, but to no avail. Extremely anxious, with his brother's auspicious day approaching and feeling ashamed to go home and face his mother, he conceived a pessimistic view of life and committed suicide by drowning in the Huangpu River the day before yesterday. His body floated to the surface of the Huangpu River at Nanmatou yesterday morning. The Lifesaving Bureau patrol boat brought the body to the Bund. The head of the 16th street reported to the local court for an inquest. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia and Inspector Shen arrived to examine the body and confirmed that there was no other cause of death and that it was a case of drowning. The family was instructed to prepare a coffin.</p>

<h3>Hongsheng and Others Accused of Illegally Withdrawing 150,000 in Special Commissions</h3>
<p>Commissions Withdrawn Even Though Loans Failed to Materialize</p>
<p>Creditors File Lawsuit in Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The Huadong Coal Mining Company was reorganized from the Jiawang Coal Mining Company. Later, Liu Hongsheng, a director of the company, agreed to borrow 800,000 on behalf of Huadong. In addition to paying interest, a special commission of 30 cents per ton of coal sold was to be extracted. Because the aforementioned loan failed to materialize, Gu Zonglin, the former manager, agreed to raise one million, with a special commission of 50 cents per ton. However, the loan was never obtained, but the special commissions were still extracted. The creditors, Yuanji Company, Yan Huiyu, and Jin Cheng and Yanye Banks, believed that this action greatly damaged their rights as creditors. They hired lawyers Qiu Fenling and others to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against the general manager and directors of the company, Zhang Duchen, Hua Jianquan, Xie Hengyun, Xu Zhiyi, Bao Zidan, Tian Youfu, Lu Yinfu, Sheng Mirong, Li Bake, Wang Jianxun, He Jingfu, Li Yuliang, Liu Hongsheng, Gu Zonglin, and fourteen others, seeking confirmation that the 150,000 in special commissions withdrawn in 1935 were invalid and ordering the defendants to be responsible for canceling them. Yesterday morning, Judge Tao Dejun opened the 13th Civil Division for questioning. Due to the complexity of the case and the need for further investigation, he adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Jiang Xingjie's Youngest Son Sues for Inheritance: Continued Hearing</h3>
<p>Legal Aid Application Awaiting Ruling</p>
<p>After the death of Jiang Xingjie, a Shanghainese merchant from Nanjing, his estate was substantial and was managed by his concubine, Yang, and her sons, Guoyou and Guozhang. Now, Xingjie's youngest son, Guopei, through his lawyers He Shimei, Fan Gang, and Ling Qihong, has filed a lawsuit against Jiang Yang, Jiang Guoyou, and Jiang Guozhang, seeking a division of the estate, requesting one-third of his father's 3 million estate, totaling 1 million. The First Special Court has already held a hearing on the matter, as reported in this newspaper on April 12. However, because Jiang Guopei is unable to pay the litigation fees, he has applied for legal aid. Judge Peng Shi, who is handling the case, needs to investigate the application for legal aid. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, he summoned Jiang Guopei to the Fourth Tribunal for questioning. Guopei stated that he is 25 years old and currently resides at No. 10, Rear Building, Anren Lane, Avenue Haig. His biological mother, Wang, currently resides with her family in Wuxi. He graduated from St. John's University. Because Jiang Yang is fierce and domineering, she controls all household affairs. He is usually only given five silver dollars a month. The salary of more than twenty dollars he earns working at the Siming Insurance Company must be paid to Jiang Yang. Moreover, since September of last year, even the five dollars a month has been stopped. Therefore, he is unable to pay the litigation fees. He has tried to borrow from relatives and friends, but they have refused due to his lack of credit. His lawyers stated that Guopei’s biological mother Wang is not Jiang Xingjie's wife or concubine, but only in a cohabitating relationship, and that Wang is also a sister-in-law of Yang, so she has no standing. The general public believes that the plaintiff has no right to inherit the estate and are unwilling to lend him money. This point should be clarified by the court. Judge Peng reported and ordered Jiang Guopei to leave and await the ruling.</p>

<p>Unable to Distinguish People a Few Steps Away</p>
<p>Import Vessels All Delayed</p>
<p>Heavy fog enveloped Shanghai yesterday morning, making it impossible to distinguish people a few steps away. As a result, vessels entering the port from the Yangtze River and the sea were delayed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Fog</p>
<p>The weather this spring has been unusually abnormal. Although it is almost the end of spring, the climate is still cold. For the past half month, there has been continuous rain. Yesterday, after dawn, heavy fog returned. Visibility was poor at a short distance. It was impossible to work indoors without turning on the lights. The fog gradually dissipated around 9 AM. Heavy rain returned at 5 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Vessel Delays</p>
<p>Due to the heavy fog yesterday morning, vessels entering the port from the Yangtze River and the sea, such as the Shuang Hua, Hongda, Jiangda, British vessel Xinjiang, and Japanese vessel Ruiyang Maru, were all delayed.

<h3>Haichang Steamer Released After Seizure for Transporting Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Fine Reduced from 100,000 Yuan to 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Haichang steamer of the Haichang Steamer Company, located at No. 15 Sijing Road, with a gross tonnage of 954 tons and a net tonnage of 523 tons, was leased to a Japanese merchant by the Dalian agency at the end of January of this year for a monthly rent of 5,000 yuan. It sailed between Dalian and Tianjin, carrying smuggled goods on which taxes had not been paid. On April 2 of this year, the vessel was seized in Tianjin by the Tianjin Customs. The initial proposed penalty was 100,000 yuan, which was later reduced to 50,000 yuan. At that time, the head office requested the Japanese consul in Tianjin to negotiate with the Tianjin Customs. An agreement has now been reached for the Tianjin Customs to impose a fine of 5,000 yuan and release the vessel.</p>
<h3>Wantonly Offering Cigarettes to a Female Stranger</h3>
<p>Wang Dongxia's Rowdy Behavior</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months for Assault</p>
<p>Wang Dongxia, a native of Tianjin, has been working as a film actor at a film company. Last night, Wang went to the Good Friends Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII to drink and dance wildly. He left Good Friends around 9:30 PM, already drunk. While passing Guangdong Road, he saw Yong Chenghong, residing at No. 32 Yukang Lane, Pishao Nai Road, walking with his wife, Yu Lu, and their friend, Chen Dai. Wang approached and took a cigarette from his pocket and suddenly placed it in Yu Lu's mouth, telling her to smoke it, and uttering flirtatious remarks. Yu Chenghong stepped forward to reason with him, leading to an argument, which was dispersed by passersby. Yu and the others continued walking east. When they reached Maijiaquan, Wang suddenly arrived with three or four others and violently attacked Yu. Yu grabbed Wang, and Yu's wife and her friend came forward to help and shouted for help. The other three or four men fled in a panic. Wang was held by Yu and could not escape, and they were taken together to the General Police Station. Since Yu and Chen Dai had both been injured, Chinese detective Zhang Xiaolin sent them to Renji Hospital. It was confirmed that Yu had injuries to his back and lips, and Chen Dai had an injury to her left thigh. Wang was detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted him for assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Code, stating that the defendant was an unemployed rogue in 1926 and had been deported by the former Mixed Court. He then presented the injury reports to the court. Yu Chenghong and the others testified about what had happened. Questioned, Wang Dongxia confessed that there had been a collision, but claimed that he had been beaten by the plaintiffs and had injuries to his face and torn clothing. After verifying the testimony, Judge Chuan Lin sentenced Wang Dongxia to three months in prison for assaulting someone, as a warning. Wang expressed his dissatisfaction and stated that he would appeal.</p>

<h3>Yiyuan Rubber Factory Ceases Operations and Liquidates</h3>
<p>Workers Petition for Payment of Back Wages</p>
<p>The Yiyuan Rubber Factory at No. 920 Tangshan Road, due to declining business, financial difficulties, and inability to sustain operations, entrusted lawyers Lu Xingyuan and accountant Chen Riping to represent the liquidation on the previous day. Creditors were given one month to bring their certificates to the accountant's office to register, and debtors were also given the same period to send the money they owe to the accountant's office for settlement. The factory workers were unaware of this beforehand. When they arrived at the factory, they suddenly found the factory gate tightly closed and understood the truth. Many people gathered at once, and the situation became serious. Fortunately, the patrolling police officer persuaded them to stop before any trouble occurred. Subsequently, the workers sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition for the immediate payment of back wages and severance pay to maintain their livelihoods. The Bureau of Social Affairs has sent Zhang Chuqiang to investigate the truth with Chen Riping, the liquidator of the factory, and discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Fresh Meat Industry to Adjust Prices</h3>
<p>Scarce Supply Leads to High Pork Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai pork industry, due to the recent scarcity of fresh pork and high pork prices, is finding it difficult to operate. It is reported that a meeting of industry members will be convened to discuss solutions. According to insiders, the reasons for the recent scarcity of fresh pork supply from various regions are: 1. Rural bankruptcy in northern Jiangsu last year and low commodity prices, making the sideline of raising pigs unprofitable for rural areas. 2. This year's high grain prices have made pig feed expensive. 3. Farmers in northern Jiangsu are unwilling to engage in sideline businesses, and the number of households raising fresh pigs is decreasing daily, resulting in a sharp drop in supply to Shanghai, nearly 40%. Due to the relationship between less supply and more demand, pork prices are rising daily, with no hope of falling. The selling price of meat must be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Inland Waterway Shipping Industry Appeals for Protection of Vessels to Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs</h3>
<p>Following the robbery of the Lixin small steamer of the Shenhu Lixing Inland Waterway Shipping Bureau, the industry association immediately sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs requesting protection. The text of the telegram is as follows: Zhenjiang, Director Yu Jun of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Respectfully submitted, Lixing Shipping Bureau's Lixin small steamer, a member of the association, was robbed on April 27 while sailing from Shanghai to Huzhou. At 10 PM that night, in the Yecheng Temple area of Malan Port, it was suddenly stopped by twelve bandits, all speaking with a northern Jiangsu accent, who fired their guns. All crew and passengers had their legal tender searched and robbed, totaling over 800 yuan. In addition to reporting the case to the Pingwang Public Security Bureau for investigation, the association believes that the best way to protect the Shenhu passenger vessels is to follow the Jiangsu Province's Inland Waterway Shipping Inspection and Apprehension Measures, dispatching patrol boats from the First District of the Water Police to escort the vessels between Minhang and Pingwang. We previously sent a telegram to you requesting approval for implementation. We received approval order Xuanzi No. 350 on April 17, 1936, stating that it would be difficult to dispatch boats to escort all the frequent upstream and downstream voyages, and instructing the heads of the First and Second Districts of the Water Police to provide careful protection. Unexpectedly, protection has not been effective, and another robbery has occurred. In this situation, not only is it difficult for shipping merchants to operate, but it also hinders public security on the water. As farming season begins, farmers will be returning to their hometowns to cultivate the land, and passenger vessels will be more crowded. If bandits are allowed to run rampant, farmers will regard the ships as dangerous, affecting the rural economy, which is a great concern. The association witnesses the dangerous situation and can no longer remain silent. We dare to reiterate our previous request, respectfully requesting you to order the First District of the Water Police to assign two patrol boats to escort the vessels, which is essential for effectiveness, so that transportation will not be hindered. The telegram is urgent and awaits your orders. Chairman Han Yimin of the Shanghai Inland Waterway Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Luo Yusheng Sentenced to Death After Appealing Murder of Jin Daishi</h3>
<p>Original Trial Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lawyer Luo Zhaoxin was assassinated on Zhejiang Road in Qinghe Lane a few years ago. His son, Luo Yusheng, 22 years old, was the director of education at Mingchen Elementary School on Xinqiao Road in Nanshi. Suspecting that the murder of his father was related to Jin Daishi, a woman from Jinhua living at No. 459 Be河南路, he gathered a group of people and went to her residence at 8:30 AM on September 23 of last year, carrying axes, and killed both Jin Daishi and her maid, Luo Guo. He stole valuables and fled. Later, Huishi police detective Shang Wu arrested Luo Yusheng and sent him to the First Special Court for interrogation. He was found guilty of joint murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, and one year for theft, to be served concurrently with life imprisonment, and deprived of his civil rights for life. The defendant, Luo Yusheng, was dissatisfied with the sentence and appealed. The police also believed that Luo had committed robbery and murder, and that life imprisonment was not sufficient to cover his guilt. The Legal Department lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the reasons and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Judge Yu repeatedly opened hearings and conducted detailed inquiries and declared the case closed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhong and Wang, announced the verdict: The original judgment is revoked. Luo Yusheng is sentenced to death for joint robbery and murder, deprived of his civil rights for life, and the two axes used in the crime are confiscated. Luo Yusheng's appeal is rejected.</p>
<h3>Blessing Home for the Incurably Ill New Church Completed</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Bohong, a leader in the local Catholic community and a philanthropist, founded the Puzi Sanatorium last year in Beiqiao, specializing in the treatment of mental illness, neurological disorders, and various types of madness. He hired expert doctors and nurses for diagnosis and care. There are currently over 200 patients in the hospital. He has cured many cases of chronic diseases that have been untreatable for many years. In order to facilitate prayers for the male and female doctors, nurses, and Catholic patients in the community, Mr. Lu built a new church within the sanatorium. The church's style adopts a medieval Roman design, resplendent and magnificent, like the current St. Paul's Basilica in Rome. The interior is exquisite and magnificent, with ample light. In the center is an image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, enshrined as the patron saint, implying a plea to Our Lady to show great mercy and grant all patients an early recovery. At 8 AM yesterday morning, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai Diocese was invited to perform the blessing and pray for peace. The high Mass was celebrated with full honors by the parish priest Zhang of Dongjiadu Catholic Church, representing Liu Lijiashi. Lu Bohong and Zhu Zhiyao were liturgical ministers. Lu Yin Geng and his brothers, all members of the Catholic Action Association, as well as representatives from various districts, such as Xu Zongze, editor of the Sacred Doctrine Magazine, leaders and priests of various associations, Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China, Wang Baolun, Director of the Central Bank, He Lizhong, Gu Shouxi, and local and foreign Catholics, men and women, numbering no less than 2,000, gathered together. The ceremony was grand and solemn. The Zhenxiu Middle School Orchestra and Choir were responsible for the music and singing during the Mass. The sound was loud and resonant, the music harmonious and melodious. The hall was filled with fragrant fresh flowers and bright electric lights. The ceremony lasted for three hours before concluding. After a group photo was taken in front of the church, refreshments were served, and the various departments were visited, all expressing satisfaction before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Ning County Government Replies to Ningbo Association Telegram</h3>
<p>Suspension of Relocation of Graves in the Old City Area</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, concerned about the excavation and relocation of graves in various towns and townships of Ningbo, which has aroused strong indignation among the public, convened an emergency meeting of its executive and supervisory committee on the 2nd of this month, resolving to send telegrams to the central government requesting rectification and to organize a special committee to handle all aspects of the case. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the association, because the excavation of graves in various towns and townships has not stopped, sent a telegram to the Ning County government ordering a strict halt to the activity. The telegram from the association to County Magistrate Chen of Ning County is recorded below: Ning County Magistrate Chen Xunjian, Ningbo grave case, our association has repeatedly submitted reports to the provincial government and received approval. We hear that the Department of Civil Affairs is preparing detailed measures and will promulgate them soon.

<h3>Shanghai Zoo Purchases Lions and Elephants from Singapore</h3>
<p>Still Unable to Purchase Suzhou Baby Tiger</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zoo heard that a resident of Suzhou, Zhang Shanzi, owns a baby tiger and contacted him about purchasing it. Yesterday, according to zoo director Shen Xianrui, who spoke to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, they received a reply from Mr. Zhang stating that the tiger was purchased from Sichuan and involved a great deal of effort. He is unwilling to sell it temporarily, but he will donate it in one or two years. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of citizens to visit, they are now looking for ways to purchase the tiger in various places and are also purchasing lions and elephants from Singapore for display.</p>
<h3>Ling Xianyang Returns to China from Europe After Completing Inspection of Dock Operations</h3>

<h3>Another Appeal from Tea Merchants in Anhui</h3>
<p>Cao Yunjie Represents Petition to Reduce Tax Rates</p>
<p>The Tea Industry Associations of the counties of Xiuning, Yixian, Qimen in Anhui Province, nominated Mr. Cao Lingjie, former Chairman of the Southern Anhui Tea Appraisal Committee, as their representative to petition Beijing and Anhui to reduce tax rates this year. The short-term tea sales tax in Anhui Province, since the promulgation of the Business Tax Regulations in 1931, stipulates a tax of 0.5% on exported tea and 1% on tea sold domestically. In 1935, regardless of export or domestic sales, the tax was 1% with an additional 1.5% for the Security Team, totaling 1.2 yuan per dan. The Security Team expenses have always been added to the land tax, so tea farmers and tea merchants both bear the burden. Now, an additional tax is levied on boxed tea, which is unavoidable duplication. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and Chinese tea is declining, tea farmers and tea merchants are in a precarious situation. Therefore, Mr. Cao was specially nominated to petition Beijing and Anhui in order to reduce tax rates and alleviate business difficulties. It is reported that the representative has arrived in Beijing and may soon be transferred to Anhui.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Streetlights: Yapu Er Factory Continues to Supply</h3>
<p>Since 1931, all of the city's streetlights have been purchased by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works from the China Yapu Er Electric Appliance Factory. In each subsequent tender, because the Yapu Er products are inexpensive and of good quality, the factory has been the supplier for the past six years. This year, the Bureau of Public Works collected various light bulbs on the market and had experts conduct precise tests on them. A public tender was also advertised, which attracted a great deal of interest. The results were announced publicly on the 23rd of last month, and the Yapu Er Factory won the bid again. It is reported that the factory received formal notification from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works yesterday to continue supplying the city's streetlights.</p>

All three robbers spoke with a northern Jiangsu accent and carried handguns. They shouted to remain silent and began to ransack the house. They searched the family members of the Lius, including on their bodies. As a result, Liu Anlu's family had over 160 yuan in silver and paper money stolen, and Liu Guoan's family had over 60 yuan in silver and paper money stolen. After the robbery, the robbers left with the loot and fled west. Afterwards, the victims reported the incident to the Tanziwan Police Station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Observation of the Life of the Chinese Nation</h3>
<p>— Liu Xiang, Deputy Head of the New Movement Inspection Group</p>
<p>The composition of a nation, from a social point of view, is of course nothing more than two aspects: nature and culture. Nature is the objective environment, and culture is the subjective force. Because a nation needs to adapt to its objective environment, its subjective force has to evolve with the objective. Ancient humans were in the stage of "man competing with beasts," so their culture was the era of stone tools and pottery. Modern humans are in the stage of "man competing with nature," so their culture is the era of science and chemistry. Modern humans, in addition to "man competing with nature," have added the trend of "man competing with man," so their culture, in addition to science and chemistry, must also add political and economic issues. This proves whether the existence and growth of a nation. His culture should adapt to their environment, and at the same time, their environment will be further developed through their culture. The so-called "theory of evolution," the so-called "survival competition," and the so-called population problem, all of which are, in short, to study whether a nation is progressing or declining in the current stage?</p>
<p>To study whether a nation's culture is suitable for the objective environment, whether it is expressed from the culture or reflected from the objective, the life of the nation is the focus of this issue.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation has gone through more than 4,000 years of evolution, sometimes prosperous and sometimes declining. Now it has reached the most cutting-edge era. From the perspective of the foreign environment, the increase in the population of the great powers and imperialists, the development of culture, and the rapid advancement of the economy, the first place in the quantity and quality of the Chinese nation has long been shaken and collapsed! From the perspective of the internal situation, rural bankruptcy, natural disasters and bandits, the crisis of the nation is more deeply latent. Here, it seems that the more difficult the objective environment in China is, the more difficult it is for the Chinese nation to adapt to life. In recent years, pessimists who complain about the sky and blame others, romantics who are decadent and disappointed, and people who betray the nation and lose their conscience are everywhere. In fact, everyone has forgotten that objective misfortune comes from the fact that their own lives cannot adapt to the times. They are reversing the cause and effect, and always only expect good luck to come. Waiting for the rabbit is more than just losing the rabbit. India is dead, and the Jews are dead. If the Chinese nation does not save itself, why can't it die!</p>
<p>Before we want to innovate a nation's life, the prior understanding must be dissected from the vertical and horizontal aspects of this nation, and then we can understand the crux of the problem and correct and guide it!</p>
<p>From the Zhou and Qin Dynasties to the present, there have been about four major divisions in the life history of the Chinese nation. In each division, the life of this nation has undergone a drastic change, adapting their lives from the old stage to another new stage.</p>
<p>The first division was the Zhou and Qin Dynasties. At that time, the Han people were breeding in the Yellow River Basin. There were barbarians outside and natural disasters inside. How did our nation grow in struggle? At least at that time, the life of the nation was martial, supported the leader, worked hard for production, and admired morality. The so-called "I am the king of my land, and my conquest is meritorious!" and "Cultivate at its time, and the people will enjoy it!" "Teach with its way, and the people will be righteous!" This can prove the life of that time. By the time of the Warring States Period, the lives of ordinary people gradually became selfish and self-interested, and followed the path of romantic consumption. The so-called "If the upper and lower levels compete for profit, the country is in danger!" "There are fat horses in the stables, and there are starving people in the fields!" So it ended up dying in Qin, and Qin ended up being trapped by the Hu!</p>
<p>The second division was from the Han Dynasty to the Six Dynasties. In this division, the Chinese nation has progressed towards the Yangtze River Basin. At that time, the life of the nation can be divided into three paragraphs: the martial arts of the Han Dynasty, the culture of the Han Dynasty, and the politics of the Han Dynasty, which proved the fact that this nation had a drastic outward development, and their lives were honest, serious, and productive. The so-called "civilians have no fur without banquets," "every family with ten rooms must have stored grain," and the most things about integrity were also in the Han Dynasty, such as Xia Shi Shu Jiang, Su Wu's unyielding, and Ti Ying saving her father. It can be seen how the national spirit was at that time. This is the first stage. Let's see what the life of the nation was like in the Jin Dynasty? The customs of ordinary people were exaggerated, unproductive, and undisciplined. The upper class talked about Qing, and the lower class were leisurely. Moreover, "Wushisan," a drug like opium, was the most popular hobby at that time. Therefore, the Western Jin Dynasty perished, the Eastern Jin Dynasty split, the Eight Kings rebelled, and the Five Hus were in chaos. At the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Chinese nation had no peace! This is the second stage. Let's look further down, what was the life of our nation like in the Northern and Southern Dynasties? Romantic decadence, romantic extravagance, the relics of Jinling rouge powder, and the enjoyment of the scholar-officials of Jiangnan, the decline of the Chinese nation can be said to have reached its extreme in that era! This is the third stage in this division.</p>
<p>The third division was from the Sui and Tang Dynasties to the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties. In this division, the life of the nation can be divided into two stages: The first stage was the Tang Dynasty, the revival of the Han people. From the political achievements of that time, such as Taizong's cultural rule, the Ming Dynasty's revision, the conquest of the Turks, the subjugation of the Tibetans, the communication of Korea, and the entry into Nanyang, how was the Chinese nation breeding? Their lives were firm, arduous, upward, and trained. The "Tun Jun" system at that time can be said to be the current military training, and the "Ke Nong" system at that time can be said to be the predecessor of the current rural revival. The people of the Tang Dynasty were also through hardships and lived clean and simple lives, although there were weaknesses in the middle of the remnants of the Tang Dynasty and the Anshi Rebellion! The second stage was the declining Song Dynasty. As soon as we see history, we will remember the Song Dynasty nation. It was oppressed by the Liao, Jin, and Mongolian throughout its years. Indeed, what was the life of the nation like at that time? Buddhist and Taoist ideas were very popular. Scholar-officials only talked about reason and forgot about military preparations. Civilians only knew how to love peace and live in peace, but they did not know how to cheer up. The Northern Song Dynasty perished, and the Southern Song Dynasty was in Jiangnan. The life of the court and the public at that time was whitewashing peace. Taking the past as a lesson for the present, how different is it! Therefore, it was trapped in Liao, succumbed to Jin, and eventually perished in Yuan.</p>
<p>The fourth division was the era in which the Chinese nation lost the country twice, from Yuan to Ming to Qing. However, in this division, we can see the great power of the Chinese nation, based on the Han people, to promote their assimilation. Incorporating the spirit of "Jurchen" and "Timur" into the decadent life of the Han people at that time, the history of the life of the Chinese nation changed again. The famous "Yellow Peril" in world history, and the unprecedented expansion of the Chinese territory, to this day, the national hero Genghis Khan is still praised by the people. The life of the Chinese nation at that time can be said to be the entire militarization, the so-called life of ancient chariots and iron cavalry. Although the Ming Dynasty was very weak in national military power, the economic prosperity of the Chinese nation was achieved by the Ming Dynasty to some extent. Sanbao eunuch, the only navigator in China, first went to Nanyang by sea, and at that time, the life of the nation still retained a little of the spirit of outward development left over from the Yuan Dynasty. By the time of the Qing Dynasty, this was a drastic change in the Chinese nation. How heroic was the first half of the Qing Dynasty, and how diligent and frugal was the life of the people. However, since the second half of the Qing Dynasty, the corruption of China's internal affairs and the failure of diplomacy have shown the darkness and turmoil of the life of this nation everywhere. There is no vitality at all. Just seeing the popularity of opium can summarize everything at that time!</p>
<p>Of course, before examining the life of the current stage, from historical observations, we can summarize and judge. The rise and fall of the Chinese nation is completely related to how they live. If their lives can be invigorated, no matter how complex and difficult the objective environment is, in fact, they can also adapt and develop. Please see what kind of situation is the environment and life of our nation today?</p>
<p>At present, the international environment is watching China surrounded in two different ways. The first is with the market as the goal, attempting the redistribution of the world. Abyssinia has been merged into Italy, the seriousness of the German-Austrian issue, the waves of the Suez Canal, the tension of the Strait of Gibraltar, and the black shadows in the West are accelerating the crisis in the Far East and China. The Chinese nation is located inside the two major powers of Japan and Russia. Whether it is the redization of Asia or the Monroe Asia, this nation has no possibility of gaining a foothold. The second is surrounded by the Chinese nation under the public example of survival of the fittest according to the law of natural survival. The stagnation of China's population, the abandonment of China's reserves, the weakness of national military power, and the corruption of national life are all counter-evidences to the prosperity of other ethnic groups such as the English, Latin, Caucasian, Taihe, and Teutonic, the progress of science, the expansion of military preparations, the increase in population, the insufficient land, the exhaustion of raw materials, the unevenness of colonies, and the various needs of living conditions. It is impossible to solve their internal contradictions without starting to invade the weak, and the old Chinese nation is bearing the brunt! However, looking back at the Chinese nation, how will it rise to adapt and fight against this complex and difficult environment in the future? Not only is there no such preparation and training, but it is still falling more deeply. We can see the reasons for the past demise in history, which is really chilling!</p>
<p>Of course, we now need to ask, how should our nation's life adapt to this complex environment? Here are only three paths for us to strive for: The first is to use the life of national self-defense to deal with the complex international environment. Although the world in 1936 is an era when weak nations are bullied everywhere, it is also a period of great alliances between weak nations that constitute a line of resistance. As long as we see Egypt, the recent anti-British movement of the Arab nation, Turkey's armed Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits, the power of the Spanish People's Front, and the mobilization of the Austrian border troops, no weak nation is not working hard for their self-defense. In such an international environment, the only thorough means for the Chinese nation is to rise up and defend our country! Because we want to defend ourselves, life must be militarized. Organize ourselves, train ourselves, discipline is the spirit of our lives, and machinery is the order of our lives. In peacetime, we are members of the nation, and in wartime, we are all soldiers of the nation. Secondly, we must use the life of national self-sufficiency to deal with the environment of international economic panic. The current stage of China's national economy is not uneven distribution, but no production. The way out for China's economy is not to invade others, but to live independently of its own nation and not rely on others. The only problem is to become productive. In recent years, in the international economic situation, the Soviet Union's abandonment of the economic policy of socialism with machines, the large-scale control methods of the United States, the colonial barriers of Britain, the concentration of gold in France, and the new national debt agreement in Germany are all efforts to do the work of raising, in order to cope with the extraordinary situation. Of course, China is no exception. It seems that China's work of raising today is more important than others. The so-called war has no surplus grain, and the room is empty. Although we are determined to do it, it is not allowed in fact. Therefore, because of the sake of raising, the national life needs to be simple and plain, save consumption, work hard for production, pay attention to various collective savings in peacetime, increase labor, and control the raw materials of materials and limit the waste of each individual in wartime, in the poor environment in all aspects, we have laid a foundation. The third is to use the life of national self-love to maintain this decadent and loose national consciousness, in order to cope with the current sharp international era. Looking around, the recent revival of heroism in the German nation, the right-wing trend of the Teutonic national thought in Europe, the strictness of the Slavic national red organization, and the advocacy of the Asian lifeline of the Yamato nation are all drumming up the tension of the national spirit to solve the difficulties of each individual. The shaking of national consciousness in China in recent years, and the tendency of "everyone can be a monarch," has created a large number of traitors who betray the nation. Therefore, the life of our nation must be artistic, and we must do the task of teaching. Ten years of teaching and gathering, one battle and dominance, "this is the lesson in history. Our current life, at a minimum, must achieve a healthy, rational, scientific, and conscientious life that is useful. It is not an empty and mysterious cultivation, but a practical morality that touches the heart and responds to things. It can also be said that it establishes the elements of survival from the instinct of human nature.</p>
<p>Indeed, the life we are trying to innovate is nothing more than these three points: teaching to establish oneself, raising to relieve poverty, and defending to resist insults. The three are equal in time, linked, and unified. Assuming that our national life has really reached this stage, no matter how complex the objective environment is, we can adapt to it. "The fittest survive," and the revival of our nation is, in fact, not difficult to count the days and wait.</p>
<p>Special Issue on the Completion of the New Clubhouse of the China Aviation Association</p>
<h3>Overview of the Construction of the New Clubhouse of the China Aviation Association</h3>
<p>In order to lay the foundation for the China Aviation Association to save the country through aviation and develop the cause of civil aviation, the fourth meeting of the Board of Directors decided on January 15, 1935, to build a clubhouse and an exhibition hall. The 25th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Board of Directors on February 25 also appointed four directors, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yao Xijiu, and Li Dachao, to be responsible for the planning. Architect Dong Dayou was commissioned to design the building. The Shanghai Municipal Government allocated ten acres of land south of the museum in the city center, bordering the Qiu River to the south, and Fushou Zuo Road and Fu Nan Zuo Road to the east and west. The construction plan was repeatedly revised and decided. The style adopted was aircraft type, the exterior was decorated with artificial stone, and the medium and shallow carvings were simple and majestic. The bottom floor of the nose is the reception room, the upper floors of the wings are the aviation library and the exhibition hall, the bottom floor of the wings is also the aviation exhibition hall, the bottom floor of the fuselage and tail is the office, the upper floor of the nose is the memorial hall, the upper floor of the fuselage is the auditorium, and the upper floor of the tail is also the office. It is three stories high, with a handrail leaning against the wall and spiraling upwards, forming a circle in the middle. Looking up from the ground, you can see the blue sky and white sun glass on the top floor, which is dazzling. The circular wall on the highest floor is inlaid with marble name steles, engraved with the names of members, to be passed down forever. It was contracted by Jiutai Jinji Construction Factory, started on July 19, and held a foundation laying ceremony on October 12. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of December, but due to the loose foundation, the memorial hall roof could not be built and renovated on the same day, and it was completed on March 20 of this year, which lasted ten months.</p>
<p>The sanitary heating equipment was contracted by Langji Engineering Firm. Each room is equipped with a water radiator. The electric wires and lamps are contracted by Dahua Hydropower Company and Yuanfeng Architectural Decoration Company respectively. The wood is made of Liu'an wood, and the style is novel and simple, and is contracted by Shuimingchang Wood Company. The garden landscape is arranged by Shanghai Plantation. The total project and equipment cost 114,711.29 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The above is the construction process of the new clubhouse of the association. Today's completion ceremony will be reported simply.</p>
<h3>General Overview of the Chinese Aviation Association's Affairs</h3>
<p>(A) Formation of the Association</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the nation have felt the weakness of our country's air defense. Requests to the government to expand the air force and petitions to organize aviation patriotic societies have been made one after another. The central government immediately instructed the Ministry of Military Affairs to send personnel to Shanghai to liaise with leaders from all walks of life to prepare for the organization. It wasn't until November of the 21st year of the Republic of China that the Ministry of Military Affairs forwarded to the National Government a list of twenty-one people, including Wang Xiaolai and Shi Liangcai, to be appointed as directors. Thus, the Aviation Patriotic Society was officially established. Subsequently, the central government, recognizing that the aviation patriotic movement required the concerted efforts of the government and the people, especially emphasizing unified methods and comprehensive planning, should be sustainable and effective, entrusted Mayor Wu Tiecheng to consult with the directors of the Aviation Patriotic Society on expanding the organization and renaming it the Chinese Aviation Association. It was established on New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China. On that day, representatives of the National Government, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, and representatives of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Chu Minyi, delivered earnest speeches. The guests who attended the ceremony were also enthusiastic. It was a grand and unprecedented occasion. Governments and military and political circles, and leaders in Nanjing, Beiping, Guihua, Jinan, Kaifeng, Zhangjiakou, Gunzhou, Xi'an, Huoshan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Ningxia, and other places sent congratulatory telegrams to the meeting, demonstrating that the aviation patriotic movement was a matter of concern for the entire nation.</p>
<p>Attached: List of Directors: Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Wang Zhiyuan, Shi Liangcai, Zhu Qinglan, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Lin Wojiang, Li Fusun, Hu Wenhu, Hu Yunzhuang, Chen Guangfu, Huang Bingheng, Zhang Huichang, Zhang Gongquan, Weng Zhaoyuan, Zhang Boling, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Peiquan, Xiong Xiling, Dai Kuisheng.</p>
<p>(B) Progress of the Association's Affairs</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Association in January of the 20th year of the Republic of China, in the first two years, the affairs of the Association were still in the planning and promotion stages, with little to report. Towards the end of the second year, after an internal reorganization, the affairs of the Association became increasingly complex. Here is a summary of the work done:</p>
<p>Improving the Overall Organization: The Association originally had twenty-one directors, who mutually elected one managing director and appointed one secretary-general, who, under the direction of the managing director, handled all daily affairs. Since the establishment of the Association, the managing director, Lin Wojiang, concurrently served as secretary-general. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Mr. Lin resigned from his concurrent position as secretary-general due to illness. After deliberation by the standing committee, Yao Xijiu was appointed as acting secretary-general. Subsequently, at the end of October, at a board meeting, Director Wu Tiecheng proposed "improving the organization of the Association," "recruiting specialized talent," and "actively developing the Association's affairs," and the following matters were resolved: 1. Director Weng Zhaoyuan's whereabouts have been unknown since the establishment of the Association, and the government is requested to appoint Mr. Kong Xiangxi as a director of the Association. 2. Add two managing directors, with Directors Wu Tiecheng and Kong Xiangxi appointed to these positions. 3. Managing Director Lin Wojiang resigns from his concurrent position as secretary-general, and Yao Xijiu is appointed as the Association's secretary-general. 4. The Association will add the position of chairman of the board, with Director Wang Xiaolai appointed as the Association's chairman. 5. Chairman Jiang is appointed as honorary chairman of the board. 6. Secretary-General Yao is requested to make efforts to develop all matters within the Association. In January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the board of directors further resolved the following matters: 1. Chen Qingyun, Shen Deshe, Zeng Yijing, Li Jingcong, Nie Kaiyi, Li Ruyan, Wu Renshuo, and Yao Xijiu are added as directors of the Association. 2. Managing Director Lin Wojiang resigns, so Director Huang Bingheng is elected as managing director. Yu Zhaolin is also re-appointed as a director of the Association. 3. Managing Director Shi Liangcai passed away, so Director Zhang Huichang is re-elected as managing director, and Li Dachao is re-appointed as a director of the Association. The organization of the head office is now more complete than before, with one honorary chairman, one chairman, twenty-nine directors, seven managing directors, and one secretary-general, listed as follows:</p>
<p>Honorary Chairman: Jiang Zhongzheng; Chairman: Wang Xiaolai; Directors: Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Wang Zhiyuan, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Qinglan, Wu Renshuo, Wu Tiecheng, Du Yuesheng, Li Fusun, Li Jingcong, Li Dachao, Yu Zhaoqi, Shen Deshe, Lin Kanghou, Hu Wenhu, Hu Yunzhuang, Yao Xijiu, Chen Guangfu, Chen Qingyun, Zhang Huichang, Zhang Gongquan, Zhang Boling, Huang Bingheng, Zeng Yijing, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Peiquan, Li Ruyan, Nie Kaiyi, Dai Kuisheng; Managing Directors: Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Huichang, Huang Bingheng; Secretary-General: Yao Xijiu.</p>
<p>Establishing Branches in Provinces, Cities, and Overseas: In January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the board of directors resolved to establish branches in provinces, cities, and overseas. The Association submitted a report to the Executive Yuan and sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments, inviting local organizations to organize. The Association then considered the situation and successively sent personnel to various provinces to plan and carry out the work. Branches were established in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Henan. The remaining provinces are in the process of selecting personnel to contact and prepare, in order to achieve the popularization of aviation patriotism throughout the country. Regarding overseas affairs, in April of last year, Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Managing Director Wang Zhengting, and Director and Secretary-General Yao Xijiu participated in a sightseeing tour to the Philippines and held preliminary consultations with local overseas Chinese, which have made considerable progress and are being planned.</p>
<p>Publishing Periodic Aviation Publications for the Public: In September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the board of directors resolved to publish "Aviation Books and Newspapers" once a month. Starting in September, it was changed to "Aviation Bi-Monthly," published twice a month. It has now been published for fourteen issues and has been praised by all sectors of society. Currently, there are subscribers in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Henan, Anhui, Gan, Fujian, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Gansu, and other provinces, as well as overseas in Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, the United States, and other places. The reason why this publication has achieved today's success is due to the needs of the times and the enthusiastic support of compatriots from all over the world. In the future, we must strive to improve it, so that it can make greater contributions to aviation academia.</p>
<p>Establishing a Memorial Stele for Martyr Huang Yuquan: Martyr Huang Yuquan was a rising star in China's aviation world. During the January 28th Incident, he flew his plane to the front and died for his country at the Hongkou Airfield. In January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, at the fourth board meeting of the Association, Director Zhang Huichang proposed establishing a memorial stele for Martyr Huang to preserve his memory. It was resolved to proceed accordingly. The Aviation Committee was requested to designate the location of the stele next to the Xiao De Memorial Stele at the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai. Donations were collected from the directors and entrusted to the China Stone Company for construction. Chairman Lin of the National Government was requested to inscribe the stele's inscription, Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Association wrote the inscription on the stele, Director Zhang Huichang narrated the biography, and Directors Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, and Lin Kanghou and Chen Qingyun wrote inscriptions separately. The stele was unveiled at the Hongqiao Airport on October 1st of the 24th year of the Republic of China. More than a hundred people attended, including directors of the Association, captains of the solicitation teams, and representatives from various agencies and organizations. Chairman and Mayor Wu reported on the preparation process, Chairman Wang reported on the life and deeds of Martyr Huang, and Mr. Yupei, the martyr's brother and current principal of the Central Aviation Luoyang Branch School, gave a reply. The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of grief and solemnity.</p>
<p>Opening the China Flying Club: The nature of the Flying Club is to arouse the people's interest in aviation, connect the feelings of all sectors of the aviation community, study aviation-related academics, and lay the foundation for national primary aviation talent reserves. All countries have established such clubs, and they are large in scale. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Association submitted a request to establish the "Shanghai Flying Club." The proposed charter seemed to focus on education. At the fourth board meeting in January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, five directors, Zhang Huichang, Nie Kaiyi, Wu Renshuo, Li Ruyan, and Yao Xijiu, were appointed to re-draft the plan, change the name to "China Flying Club," draft the charter and practical guidelines, and prepare a budget estimate. The Aviation Committee approved it for record. It was officially established on the Double Tenth Festival last year. Young people across the country competed to join as members, which was extremely enthusiastic. The current work is as follows: (1) Holding free sightseeing flights. In order to promote social atmosphere, advocate aviation interest, and get used to aerial movements, the club holds free sightseeing flights. Participants are not divided by gender, and those who are physically strong and good at flying are not charged, but a miscellaneous fee of two yuan is charged for transportation. It began on March 1st of this year. One session is held every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, for a total of twelve flights. More than one hundred and seventy people have participated. City sightseeing flights are also held, and participation is also extremely enthusiastic. (2) Flight training class. In order to promote aviation interest and cultivate aviation technical talent, the club requested government approval to hold civil training matters and hold flight training classes, using the latest type of aircraft and the most complete curriculum, and hiring experienced aviation experts to serve as coaches. The registration period is from April 20th to the 15th of this month, and the number of participants is extremely crowded.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Fundraising to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebrations</h3>
<p>This year in September, it happened to be Chairman Jiang's 50th birthday celebration. Chairman Jiang has never made a show of celebrating birthdays, but all sectors of our country, for this great leader of the industry, who has dedicated himself to the party and the country for decades, working hard and enduring hardships, seeking survival for the country, and seeking rejuvenation for the nation, cannot but have some celebration. In order to express our respect and admiration for Chairman Jiang's enthusiasm for working hard for the party and the country, the Association launched a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft as a memorial for Chairman Jiang's 50th birthday, different from the extravagant and wasteful customs of the world, and to carry out a practical movement to save the country, promote aviation patriotism, and strengthen national defense. I think Chairman Jiang will be able to sympathize with this. Since its launch, all parties have responded enthusiastically, which shows how much he is loved. The progress of the situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Progress in Shanghai: At the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Association, it was resolved to raise 1 million yuan in Shanghai to purchase 10 aircraft, named the Zhongzheng Squadron, to promote the campaign. Shanghai Mayor Wu invited leaders from all walks of life to the municipal government on March 10 to discuss the progress methods. It was decided that the fundraising period would be six months (from March to August). Fundraising methods: divided into ordinary and special types. Ordinary birthday gift donations can be donated by each person at will. Special donations use birthday gift coupons. The denominations of the gift coupons are divided into: Heaven-grade 10,000 yuan, Earth-grade 5,000 yuan, Middle-grade 1,000 yuan, Right-grade 800 yuan, Harmony-grade 600 yuan, Peace-grade 500 yuan, Fortune-grade 400 yuan, Prosperity-grade 300 yuan, Longevity-grade 200 yuan, and Happiness-grade 100 yuan.

Wu Tiecheng, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Yu Zuoting, and Zhang Shouyong were appointed as standing committee members. Yao Xijiu was appointed as secretary-general, and Li Dachao was appointed as general manager. The office was located at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. On April 28, a second meeting was held to decide to publish an announcement in the newspaper inviting people from all walks of life to participate in the launch, so as to achieve significant results, and to discuss matters related to organization, publicity, promotion, and liaison. Regarding the clearing of donations, in order to order the aircraft, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yao Xijiu, Li Dachao, etc. were appointed to handle it. Since this meeting, the office has started to solicit sponsors. Those who have replied to agree include: in addition to the committee members appointed at the first meeting, who are of course sponsors, there are leaders from various agencies, organizations, factories, companies, banks, schools, etc., Ye Zhuotang, Li Tingan, He Bingsong, Tang Shoumin, Chen Hong, Zhao Jinqing, Ma Deji, Chu Huiseng, Chen Taoyi, Fang Jiaobo, Song Ziliang, Li Fuhou, Guo Shun, Bei Songsun, Wang Xiaoying, Hu Xiyuan, etc. can also be seen to be enthusiastic participants.</p>
<p>Various Organizations Plan to Raise Funds: Various organizations are very enthusiastic about fundraising for aircraft purchases to commemorate the event. Those who have been contacted and decided include: various agencies under the municipal government plan to raise tens of thousands of yuan, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association plans to raise 100,000 yuan, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association plans to raise 90,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft, named "Miscellaneous Grain," the Exchange plans to raise tens of thousands of yuan, the Municipal Education Association plans to raise 90,000 yuan, the General Labor Union plans to raise 20,000 yuan, the China Women's Relief Association for Northeast Compatriots will transfer the remaining 8,000 yuan to donate, and the Wheel Navigation Industry and Hardware Industry Associations will each subscribe to a Middle-grade special birthday gift coupon, totaling 2,000 yuan. The Party and National Flag Promotion General Bureau suggested organizing a Party and National Flag promotion and publicity group, so that the city will universally purchase Party and National Flags, and 15% of the sales price will be transferred to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations. Shanghai Xianghu Company, from April to the end of August, will donate half of all sales of ink and Xianghu to the Association. Separate letters have been sent to introduce this to various agencies and organizations, which have done their best to support. Shanghai Candy Company plans to sell 50,000 yuan worth of exquisite candies, and half of the proceeds will be donated to this. These are the fundraising plans of various organizations.</p>
<p>Donations from Theater Performances and Amusement Parks: In order to raise funds widely and complete the mission on schedule, the Association sent letters to all entertainment venues and movie theaters in the city, requesting to set aside one day to donate all business income to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations. Theaters have responded one after another, including the Enpaiya Grand Theater, the Golden Grand Theater, the Great World Amusement Park, the Common Stage Grand Theater, the Great Stage Grand Theater, and comedian Zhang Ye'er's performance at the Central Grand Theater. Other theaters and movie theaters are in the process of promoting scheduled events.</p>

This shows a glimpse of the enthusiasm of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Birthday Celebration Chains Responding from Various Places: Li Dachao, the general manager of the Association, and Li Senjun, of the Special Party Department of the 33rd Division of Hubei, launched a birthday celebration chain to expand publicity and centralize donations. After receiving this chain, within 24 hours, 15 copies should be copied, one copy kept for oneself, and one national currency yuan attached to the aircraft purchase memorial meeting. The remaining 14 copies should be sent to relatives and friends. The people of the whole country responded one after another, with dozens of cases every day.</p>
<p>Progress in Various Provinces and Cities: The Association decided to purchase aircraft for the memorial at the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee, and then sent telegrams to the governments of various provinces and cities and various branches. The replies from various provinces were received. The gist is extracted as follows: Jiangsu Province plans to present nine aircraft, each costing 80,000 yuan in national currency, and will raise enough money by the end of May. Zhejiang Province convened a meeting of various agencies and stipulated that 150,000 yuan should be raised to purchase three fighter jets and form a squadron, which is being actively carried out. Jiangxi Province decided to raise 80,000 yuan and will remit it to the head office after it is collected. Henan Province is handling the planning and decided to donate a minimum of 150,000 yuan. Hunan Province decided to temporarily set up one aircraft, about 100,000 yuan, and remit it in advance from the fundraising fund. If there is more in the future, it will be purchased again, and it is planned to name it "Hengyu," and present it in the name of the provincial government and branch. Fujian Province is planning in general, and will report again after the board of directors decides. Shandong Province, due to financial difficulties, intends to purchase an aircraft worth 12,000 yuan to express its slight sincerity.

<p>Regarding the return of the Boxer Indemnity between China and the United States, there is a formal note from the Chinese Minister to the United States, Mr. Shi, to the U.S. Department of State, dated June 6, 1915, and a formal note from the U.S. Department of State to the Chinese Minister to the United States, dated July 20, along with the attached order from the U.S. President to implement the return of the Boxer Indemnity, as evidence. The Boxer Indemnity has been returned twice. The first return was implemented starting in January 1909, totaling USD 28,901,509.31, specifically for the establishment of Tsinghua Academy and sending students to study in the United States. The second return was USD 12,545,438.67, of which USD 6,131,755.09 was principal and USD 6,413,683.58 was interest, to be paid in 20 years. The fixed amount to be received annually is USD 539,588.76. The year the entire U.S. Boxer Indemnity will be fully paid off is expected to be 1946. The Sino-American institution managing the returned Boxer Indemnity jointly formed the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, which was established in September 1924. It is an independent entity. The Chinese directors include Cai Yuanpei and ten others, and the American directors include John Leighton Stuart and five others. The foundation manages the allocation of the Boxer Indemnity. Apart from retaining a portion as a permanent fund, the remainder is used to subsidize educational and cultural endeavors, including: (1) Educational endeavors, tentatively focusing on scientific research (including physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy), scientific applications (including agriculture, engineering, and medicine), and science education (including science education and scientific research on education); cultural endeavors are tentatively limited to libraries; other educational and cultural endeavors with nationwide impact are also under consideration. When providing subsidies to a certain institution, in addition to requiring past achievements and the ability to maintain the status quo, an important condition is the ability to raise a portion of the funds themselves. Except for those receiving only a one-time subsidy, unless otherwise agreed or planned, annual subsidies are tentatively limited to three years. If there are no significant achievements during the subsidy period, the foundation may stop paying the subsidy at any time. Any requests for allocation of funds for use as a foundation will not be granted. The foundation's past endeavors have been detailed in the foundation's annual reports, and only the main points of the foundation's activities in the 24th year are described below. A. Self-managed activities: The number of science professorships established this year is six, three fewer than in the 23rd year. As of July of the 24th year, the schools and departments where professorships have been established include: Wuhan University, physics (established for six years), chemistry (established for six years), zoology (established for five years), and botany (established for six years); Sichuan University, zoology (established for five years) and educational psychology (established for six years). More than 50 people were awarded science research grants and subsidies after review. The Compilation and Translation Committee has achieved considerable success, with translated publications. B. Jointly managed activities include the National Peiping Library (the library was officially opened in June 1931 in cooperation with the Ministry of Education; this year, the library also exchanged librarians with the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris for the first time, with Mr. Wang Chongmin sent abroad and Ms. Nolleap coming to the library to work), the Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute (the institute was established in memory of Fan Jing Sheng, a former director of the foundation, with a fund of 150,000 yuan allocated by the Shangzhi Society and entrusted to the foundation to form the institute), the foundation's cooperative research fund with Peking University (the foundation and Peking University agreed to allocate 200,000 yuan each as a special fund for cooperative research; later, it was agreed that from the 23rd year to the 26th year, the foundation would allocate 109,000 yuan each year, while Peking University would still allocate 200,000 yuan; the purpose is to establish research professorships at Peking University, to supplement the equipment of Peking University's libraries, instruments, and other institutions, and to establish scholarships and grants for Peking University students; this year, there are a total of 18 research professorships, divided into mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, economics, history, philosophy, literature, politics, and Chinese law, and are held by Gley, Zeng Zhaolun, Rao Yuqin, and Osgu, among others). C. Subsidized institutions: This year, there are a total of 19 subsidized institutions, of which 9 are schools, 6 are academic organizations, and 4 are educational and cultural organizations.</p>
<p>United Kingdom. The United Kingdom's return of the Boxer Indemnity, according to the exchange of notes between China and the United Kingdom in September 1919, stipulates that the total amount to be returned from December 1922 to February 1945 is £6,933,319.9 shillings in principal and £4,253,28.4 shillings in interest, totaling £11,186,547.13 shillings (the 4% interest deducted by the Chinese government customs must still be subtracted from this amount), specifically for mutual development purposes between the two countries. The method is to first use the funds as loans to develop railway construction and other productive industries, and then use the interest from the loans to develop educational and cultural endeavors. In the past four years, the funds have been used to develop productive industries, such as reorganizing and constructing railways, developing water conservancy, developing basic industries, developing gas business, and reorganizing transportation. There are a total of 25 cases, and the interest is used to support cultural endeavors, such as subsidizing the construction costs of the National Central Museum and the National Library by 1.5 million yuan each, allocated in installments over the years, establishing six professorships, each with an annual subsidy of 10,000 yuan for a period of three years, distributed among Central University, Zhongshan University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, the Beiyang Technical College, and the Central Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, and subsidizing the Central Research Institute's manufacturing of scientific instruments and equipment at a cost of 100,000 yuan, allocated in three installments, a subsidy of 100,000 yuan to the Peking Research Institute, with 69,000 yuan to subsidize the Physics Research Institute and 90,000 yuan to subsidize the Chemistry Research Institute, allocated in three installments, and subsidizing the equipment costs of the Nankai Mathematics Department and the equipment costs of Peking University and the Xiangya Medical College of the Scottish Church Medical College, the construction costs of the Shanghai Medical College, the National Institute of Compilation and Translation, and the Sino-British Cultural Association, and the compilation of books and atlases by the China Society for the Study of Architecture, and overseas study expenses of 180,000 yuan. Over the years, students have been sent to the UK for further study, and there have been awards for topics such as history textbooks for senior primary schools, songs for elementary schools, and public education lectures, as well as subsidies for special education expenses, and subsidies for the construction of elementary schools in Ningxia and Qinghai. In total, various types of allocations amount to 1.336 million yuan (the above is the amount of subsidies allocated in the 23rd year, while in the 24th year, there were subsidies for equipment expenses for Yunnan University and Guangxi University, and award funds for history textbooks for junior middle schools in Guizhou, as well as subsidies for the construction of the Xijing Midwifery School in Shaanxi and the construction of Mongolian and Tibetan elementary schools in Qinghai, and continued subsidies for various types of expenses from the 23rd year, totaling 1.3365 million yuan. In addition, 130,000 yuan was withdrawn from the reserve fund, with 100,000 yuan subsidized to the Ministry of Education for promoting short-term compulsory education in the provincial capitals of Qinghai, Ningxia, and Gansu provinces, and 30,000 yuan was used in conjunction with the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture to order 100 sets of physics experiment equipment for secondary schools from the Physics Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, of which 71 sets were sold at half price to senior middle schools in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, etc., and the remaining 29 sets were all donated to senior middle schools run by overseas Chinese in provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Suiyuan, Chahar, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai). Its expenditure principles are based on using the funds for educational and cultural buildings with permanent commemorative significance and important cultural undertakings related to the whole country, and shall not be used to subsidize the regular expenses or temporary expenses of any institutions. It should also give appropriate consideration to the central government and cultural centers throughout the country, so as to make the undertakings have a broad and effective impact, and supplement the shortcomings of domestic education and culture. Educational and cultural undertakings are divided into five categories: A. Construction of the Central Library, the Central Museum, and preservation of indigenous cultural relics; B. Higher education and research institutions (with special emphasis on agriculture, engineering, medicine, and physics); C. Scholarships for studying abroad and overseas education undertakings; D. Awards for specialized works and textbooks for vocational schools in middle and lower classes; E. Establishing model elementary and middle schools, agricultural and vocational schools, midwifery schools, and developing rural education. The proportion of allocation for each category is: 25% for Category A, 35% for Category B, 15% for Category C, 1% for Category D, and 24% for Category E. As for the annual income of the British Boxer Indemnity in the future, the annual income from 1935 to 1940 is £596,481.5 shillings and 9 pence, the annual income from 1941 to 1945 is £412,127.15 shillings and 4 pence, and the income in 1946 is £596,481.5 shillings and 9 pence (the 4% interest deducted by the Chinese customs must be deducted from all of the above). The repayment period ends in 1946. The institution managing the Boxer Indemnity is the Board of Trustees for Rehabilitation Affairs of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan of China and was established in April 1923. The Chinese trustees are Zhu Jiahua and ten others, and the British trustees are Archibald Rose and five others. The association is located in Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Reuters Claims It Did Not Attack the Chinese Soccer Team. Since There Was No Attack, There Is No Need for Correction. The Chinese Soccer Team's Trip to Europe Is Not Affected.</h3>
<p>Regarding Reuters' overseas communication, which stated that the Chinese soccer team's players had professional qualities, Shen Shuliang issued a statement refuting it, which was taken very seriously by all parties. In order to clarify the truth, this reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the agency, who explained as follows: This article was a special communication from a newspaper in London, and the author's intention was entirely to promote the Chinese soccer team and had no intention of attacking the Chinese soccer team. Since there was no attack, there is no need for correction. As far as the two soccer associations in Shanghai are concerned, the hosts are all promoting soccer and losing money to subsidize it. Their purpose is not to make money, so there is no professionalism to speak of, unlike the British professional soccer associations that rely on ticket sales for their livelihood. As for the Chinese soccer team's trip to Europe to participate in the Olympics, Europeans will definitely not misunderstand the Chinese soccer association because of this article, so it can be guaranteed that there will be no impact. Finally, the person in charge said that this misunderstanding was entirely accidental and deeply regrettable.</p>

Zhu Father will face the wise and brave Kelaimai at 6 pm today. Predicting the results, Zhu is quite confident of winning. The details of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Kuan was threatened by Que Keling as soon as he entered the arena. His own physique did not seem to have recovered to its original strength. In this inferior environment, he actually discovered a huge difference of 1 to 10, which puzzled the general audience. Fortunately, Zhu remained calm and composed, using moxibustion strategies to force his way forward repeatedly. Before long, the situation changed drastically, and he took the lead with 17 to 10, winning a lot of applause from the audience. Que Keling saw that the future was dark, and he also stepped up his efforts to catch up with a tie, and then surpassed by one point. At that time, Zhu Kuan's iron arm waved out, the enemy lost color, and four servants scored consecutively, (winning the first game with 21 to 18). The first game heard the beginning, and the situation was the opposite of the first game. Zhu completed the Bu Fen in one breath, and Que Keling was at a loss. After working hard, he only got three points. The two sides chased each other very fiercely. This number became 12 to 8. From then on, Zhu Kuan was familiar with the road, and went straight to Shuyun. Soon, he defeated Que Keling with a result of 21 to 8. Another game was Bao Sailie winning Smith. The results are as follows:</p>
<h3>Uruguayan Football Team's Tour of Europe Ends Unhappily in France: Fighting with the Paris Team; Paris Football Club Orders Eviction</h3>
<p>(Paris Reuters Newsletter) The Uruguayan football team recently toured Europe and played a game with the Paris team before returning to Uruguay. Its sudden return to the country to cancel all European tour plans was due to the Uruguayan match with the Paris team, which resulted in a big fight and ended unhappily. The Uruguayan team's travel expenses for returning home came from the Paris Football Association. If the Uruguayan team does not want to return home, the Paris Football Association will refuse to subsidize and will recover all the expenses that have been filled in. The Uruguayan Minister to Paris and the Football Association negotiated, and strongly urged the team to return home. The Netherlands and Belgium have cancelled the Uruguayan competition order in their respective countries.</p>
<p>Players attacking each other, spectators rushing into the field, and the police were urgently called to maintain order, and one player was fined for injury. This was the scene of the disturbance at that time.</p>
<p>Uruguay was the football champion of the World Games in 192 [sic] and 1928, so more than 20,000 people admired it. Columbus Football Stadium was full. The Paris newspapers vigorously promoted Uruguay's skills before the event. In the actual competition, the first half was entirely within the sphere of influence of the French team. Its counter-kinetic force was also violent rather than scientific. France's famous defender Dion was injured, and center Maier's knee was also seriously injured. Finally, Uruguay's center Cadira grabbed the ball from France's center forward Jordan and kicked him hard in the back.</p>
<p>The crowd shouted loudly, and the referee ordered the game to be suspended. Then some players attacked each other, the spectators broke through and entered, the police arrived, and the referee ordered Cadira to leave the field and continue the game, but soon the game was still suspended.</p>

<h3>Securities: Unified Class A Sees New High Price Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange was still very stable. Although the selling of each gang and retail investors was strong, Class A actually found a new high price of 68 yuan 1/2 of a corner. The situation in the morning was quite weak, and it seemed that it was not easy to rise. However, the pulling up by the long side in the afternoon turned the market atmosphere high again. The long side's loopholes are still very solid. According to market sentiment speculation, Class A may rush out of the 70 yuan mark. According to the environmental situation observation, it is not allowed to be too optimistic. The trend is easy to rise and difficult to fall, or it will see the peak first, and then decline. The experience yesterday was that the selling atmosphere was strong in the morning. For a while, the pulling up power of the long side was not available. The purchase of No. 4, 11 and 47, etc., was not as strong as the selling of No. 15 and 35 and the retail investors of each gang. The trend was quite weak. Each lot was 5 minutes, 1 jiao to 2 or 3 jiao. However, Class A was relatively strong, and it turned up 5 points at the close, and the sentiment was slightly determined again.

The closing transaction was inferior, and there was no sign of weakness. The Ding kind of this month was only small because of 7 lots, so the turn to 3 jiao and a half was also unique. Because the long side is strong and unyielding, there should still be a struggle. The result of the market price is high and low, and most of them are strong in the near term and weak in the far term, but Class A is the best. The total number of transactions was 3,945,000 yuan. The result of its rise and fall is listed in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>The cotton market has been falling for four days, but yesterday it showed a slight rebound. However, general cotton merchants are extremely pessimistic about the market because they cannot sell the 50,000 to 60,000 bales of coarse velvet cotton at once. At the same time, the demand for existing cotton mills is stagnant. Only a part has turned from short to long.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Drag in New Flowers</p>
<p>Before the opening of the premium flower market, US cotton South was sold short and fell 4 to 8 pounds and 75 rupees. Osaka Sanpin flowers fell 2 or 3 corners. The market sentiment was still alarming, and most people were bearish. Each month fell by 2 or 3 corners. However, Hexing Changfeng and Yikang successively made up for the short positions, and the market turned high. It turned from frustration to firmness. However, Yuan Yi and Yuan Xingchang closed their long positions, and the short positions were increased, and the pressure was still strong. As a result, each month fell by 5 points to 1 corner compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation turned tight after the opening in the afternoon. Because Japanese merchants are stepping in for new flowers in October, it is said that they have entered 20,000 to 30,000 dan in these three days.

<p>Cotton Mill Demand is Weak</p>
<p>The consumption of raw cotton is quite sluggish, and the demand for factories is special. The source is 950 bales of Yaohua and 90 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a slight rebound due to the continuous sharp decline. However, most market targets are bearish, because the more than 31,000 bales of yarn in the warehouse lack liquidity and have been firm for a long time, so the pullback has not been much. Therefore, short-selling discussions are still exhausted. However, some people have fallen by more than 10 yuan compared to the high price, and their intentions have changed, and they have turned from short to long.</p>
<p>Premium Yarn Rises Back 80-90 Corners</p>
<p>Before the opening of the premium yarn market, the price was uneven in each month due to the severe pressure from the short side. The long side seemed to be frightened and was photographed until the distant month fell by 6-7 corners. However, Hexing Changfeng continued to make profits to offset the bottom, and the table was supported. However, the short side of Ruidayuanyi added code, and the market was still flat. As a result, each month rose by 1, 3, and 4 corners compared to the closing price of the previous day, but October fell by 3 corners. After the opening in the afternoon, the market was slightly firm, because a part of the purchase was made. As for the long side, most of the retail investors had cleared up their cuts, but the big households had not yet taken action. Therefore, the chips in the market were not as loose and abundant as the previous day. As a result, each month rose by 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 corners compared to the closing price in the morning.

<h3>Bombay's Cotton Industry was Sluggish Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the cotton market was depressed because there was a boost abroad, and the selling momentum was better. After the white Roxie for April and May next year opened, a large number of sales were made, which greatly affected the entire market situation. Export inquiries were calm, and the public intended to be quiet for a long time. If the price of white Roxie fell again, it may arouse demand.

<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Price Declines Intensify</h3>
<p>Following the morning market opening, flour prices for both near and far months continued the downward trend from yesterday. Opening prices immediately followed suit. Extensive selling by inland merchants and Shanghai factories of far-month contracts in recent days further fueled the bearish sentiment among both internal and external short sellers. While large external investors remained steady, many smaller players lost confidence and sought to exit positions. As a result, the flour market saw prices decline steadily. Selling pressure remained strong throughout the afternoon, causing the market to fall further. Trading only stabilized near the close when factory shorts stopped selling. However, with clear weather anticipated and prospects for a bountiful new wheat harvest, the flour market may experience another decline. Ultimately, near and far-month contracts each fell by approximately 3 fen.</p>
<p>After the morning market opening, the wheat market was pressured by continuous price declines. Large external investors paused their buying, while many floating long positions lost their conviction. Inland merchants and factories took advantage of the situation and sold off their holdings. Amid the liquidation of long positions and aggressive short selling, market prices naturally declined. However, near-month contracts were supported by limited spot availability, while far-month contracts were pressured by increased short selling. Closing prices for June and July each fell by 2 fen, August by 4 fen, and September by 5 fen. Factories also sought to lower spot purchase prices, but sellers remained firm due to limited arrivals and inventories. Yesterday, 300 bags of Shandong wheat were sold at 5.20 yuan per bag, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Weakening Export Demand: Sentiment Towards American Wheat Slightly Bearish</h3>
<p>In the American wheat market, Texas and Oklahoma experienced abundant rainfall. Estimates suggest total wheat carryover stocks amount to 150 million bushels, exceeding expectations. With export demand weakening, sentiment has become slightly bearish.</p>
<h3>Limited Arrivals and Inventory of He Xia Rice: Active Spot Sales of Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of Ke Xian rice remained strong, while Wen Tai rice and Jiangxi rice continued to arrive steadily. Due to the hot weather, Wen Tai rice was sold off at discounted prices to avoid spoilage. Both internal and external domestic traders and firms were also unwilling to hold inventory for long. Consequently, the market exhibited a tendency toward a progressive and sharp decline. However, limited arrivals and inventories of He Xia rice, along with reduced supply of Su rice, led to a sudden surge in spot sales in the local market. Nonetheless, with sellers eager to unload their stocks, prices still fell by 5 fen. 7,750 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,400 bags of Wen Tai rice, 670 bags of Jiangbei rice, 300 bags of Hunan rice, 300 bags of Shashi rice, and 100 bags of Siamese No. 4 broken rice were all sold through spot sales in the local market.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Slightly Stabilized Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the number of suppliers remained limited to just over 20, with a total supply of over 4,000 shi. This slightly stabilized sentiment in the local market, and sales activity increased slightly compared to previous days. Market conditions showed signs of tightening. Fresh, high-quality early glutinous rice rose by several fen to nearly 1 jiao, while older stocks remained unchanged. Demand for low-grade paddy rice remained weak, with only 500 to 600 bags being purchased by Dalian merchants. Consequently, market conditions were ordinary. Retail demand showed slight improvement, and Du Yang glutinous rice also saw a slight increase in price. Yin Bian Yuan rice saw no significant price fluctuations.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, 36 to 37 boats arrived from various routes in He Xia. Due to the rainy weather, buyers attempted to push prices higher, but overall sales remained ordinary. Prices for high-grade glutinous rice were firm due to limited supply, while medium-grade rice was weak. Prices for early paddy rice and Yin Bian Yuan rice remained unchanged. Supply of Du Bu sharp rice was scarce, and prices remained stable. Prices for all other rice varieties showed a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Foreign Sesame Seed Sales Decline, Prices Drop</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil and Peanut Oil Show Slight Increase</p>
<p>Despite a firm domestic trend, foreign sesame seeds faced weakening overseas conditions and exchange restrictions, leading to reduced sales. Yesterday, only Japanese merchants inquired about 50 tons at a price of 13 yuan, a decrease of 1 jiao compared to the previous market. Sales of soybean cake remained sluggish. Although Dalian reportedly announced price increases, this was likely temporary and failed to stimulate market sentiment. The slow movement of soybean cake and sluggish sales of soybeans contributed to a stagnant market atmosphere. Yesterday, only scattered inland merchants purchased one truckload each of Bengbu soybeans and Changchun soybeans. Local merchants purchased 550 bags of sand yellow Du soybeans. Soybean oil and peanut oil showed signs of small price increases, but the overall trend remained sideways.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Raw Silk Imports Decrease</h3>
<p>According to New York raw silk inventory reports, both raw silk imports and sales decreased in April.

<p>Huzhou New Tea Already Weighed: Due to the cold weather this year, the plucking of new green tea in Huzhou has been delayed. In recent days, mao tea from various mountain regions has entered the market. According to news from Si'an, the new tea in that region has already been weighed, with opening prices at 66 yuan, brisk sales, and stable market sentiment.</p>
<h3>British Tea Merchants Request Release of Exchange Rates for Market Opening</h3>
<p>Since foreign tea firms announced the suspension of exchange settlements, new tea has been arriving in Shanghai continuously. Foreign firms with local tea factories have been actively processing and shipping tea for export, significantly impacting the business of other foreign firms. Following a meeting yesterday, Jardine, Ilbert &amp; Co., and David Sassoon &amp; Co. jointly sent a letter to the Tea Guild, requesting that the original exchange rates be released for market opening.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Middle-Grade White Sugar Plunges by 7.5 Jiao</h3>

The Guild's listed price for spot goods of 24 coarse white sugar was 22 yuan, and the price for transit goods was 6.85 yuan, with some offering 6.8 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Demand for Eastern raw sugar was lacking. Spot goods of Eastern white sugar No. 4 were at 21.75 yuan, and transit goods at 6.75 yuan, both down by 5 fen, with some transactions. Spot goods of No. 8 were at 21.35 yuan, and transit goods at 6.4 yuan. Spot goods of No. 9 were at 21.2 yuan, and transit goods at 6.2 yuan, down by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The Benchang factory's soft white sugar, such as those from Zhen Ji, Da Dan, and Jin Xin, were all quoted at original prices, with no movement. Only Chaozhou was offering 24 bags of Chi Chi at 12 yuan.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Joint Company held its bidding session yesterday. The total quota for Guangdong was 6,748 bags. 642 bags of Five Rams coarse white sugar from the Shunde factory were priced at 21.8 yuan, and another 130 bags from the Qu Xi factory were priced at 21.6 yuan, with no price changes. However, No. 2 soft white sugar was at 20.8 yuan, and No. 4 was at 20.6 yuan, both down by 2.5 jiao, but no transactions occurred. Middle-grade white sugar plunged by 7.5 jiao to a price of 19.8 yuan, with only 20 bags being transacted.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Pickled Mustard Prices Tighten</h3>
<p>Since the new Sichuan pickled mustard has come out, arrivals have remained limited, and production costs have been difficult to reduce. As a result, there has been no easing in prices, but rather a tightening trend. In recent days, Fuling pickled mustard has been selling for 22.5 to 23 yuan, Gao Le Qi pickled mustard for 25.5 yuan, and ordinary pickled mustard for 24 to 23.5 yuan, with approximately 600 units being transacted. Sales are primarily driven by local and inland markets. There are only slightly over 3,000 jars of goods that have not yet been sold, indicating that there is no hope for a price decline in the near future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Sand Ginger Rises Another 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, sand ginger prices have been rising due to limited arrivals and firm production costs. The asking prices are difficult to match, so sellers are holding onto their goods and selling sparingly. It was reported that scattered transactions occurred yesterday, with prices rising by 2 yuan compared to previous days. Inventory levels are indeed low, so despite the high asking prices, the trend is very firm.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Feng)</p>
<p>In the past, during the era of autocracy, young people's marriages were entirely dictated by their parents through matchmakers. It was a system subordinate to the authoritarian rule of the family head, aligning with the political system of the time. While this inevitably created many unhappy couples, it also allowed young people more opportunities to devote themselves to their studies, hoping for greater achievements in their future careers, as they could focus without distractions. Now, with freedom of love prevailing, marriage follows the increasing age and physiological changes of young people, immediately becoming their most pressing issue upon entering the world, one that they must resolve themselves. To seek a spouse, one must first study the knowledge and techniques of love; to ensure a reliable marriage, one must sacrifice a considerable amount of time for investigation. In this way, unhappy couples may not be entirely eliminated, but observing the increasing number of divorce cases, the prime of youth easily slips away like flowing water, leading to regret! Furthermore, it is evident that among so-called "transactional marriages," aside from a few men and women who claim to be modern but harbor ulterior motives, the majority of couples manage to live peacefully. This is not a matter of mere chance. Those enthusiastic proponents of freedom of love and autonomy in marriage should reconsider this!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Master of Paper Tent and Copper Vase Studio</p>
<p>Among spring flowers, the begonia is the most charming. When in bud, it resembles dots of rouge, as if about to be applied to the cheeks of a beautiful woman. Planting them near walls or stones is most picturesque. The trees are about eight feet tall, and the flowers have single or double petals, in both light red and deep red varieties. The Chang Le Zhi (Record of Lasting Happiness) states: "Begonia is red, but when grafted with quince, it turns white." The Suo Sui Lu (Record of Trifles) also states: "The nature of yellow begonia is similar to that of the begonia, with slightly round and deep green leaves, smooth and dissimilar. The flowers are initially goose-yellow when half-open, gradually becoming light yellow when fully bloomed." Hong Shi has a poem about yellow begonia, saying: "Like a beauty with a half-covered forehead in the Han palace, elegant and refined, worthy of being called a flower fairy, nature bestows a gentle grace, making up a beautiful appearance in a casual manner." Thus, it can be known that there are variations in color, from white to yellow.</p>
<p>Chen Si of Qiantang wrote a Begonia Handbook, with narratives and poems, totaling over ten thousand words, comparable to Wang Guan's Peony Handbook and Ouyang Xiu's Record of Peonies in Luoyang, all famous works about fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>According to ancient methods, to make begonia flowers fresh and abundant, one should water the roots with fermented grains on the winter solstice morning. Also, after the begonia flowers wither and bear fruit, prune them, so that the flowers will be abundant and without leaves in the following year.</p>
<p>Begonias have soft branches, long stems, and light red colors, with drooping flowers facing downward, known as weeping begonias. Those suitable for potted plants are called crabapple begonias. Those that are about ten to twenty feet tall, with dense branches and smooth stems, are called Xifu begonias.</p>
<p>Begonias have scandalous histories. The Wai Shi Tao Wu (Unofficial History of Tao Wu) states: "Pan Kang of Shu had a favored concubine named Jie Chou, whose surname was Zhao. Her mother conceived her by swallowing begonia flower stamens. She possessed extraordinary beauty and was skilled in creating new melodies." The Leng Zhai Ye Hua (Night Talks from the Cold Studio) states: "The Emperor Emeritus ascended the Agarwood Pavilion and summoned Consort Yang. At that time, she was still drowsy from her midday nap. He ordered strong men to assist the maids in supporting her to come. The consort, with her tipsy charm and disheveled makeup, with her hair and ornaments in disarray, was unable to perform the proper bows. The Emperor Emeritus smiled and said, 'Is it that the consort is drunk? It is that the begonia has not slept enough.'"</p>
<p>In the Jiangnan region, begonias are called "Chuan Hong" (Sichuan Red). Wu Zhongfu's poem says: "Regretting that the beautiful spring season favors the land of Shu, there is no color like Sichuan Red." Its name is quite peculiar.</p>

<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>— Manzi</p>
<p>One day, I met Mr. Hong Shen. He told me that he had recently written a script for the Star Film Company called "New and Old Shanghai," which was an experiment. In this script, there are no main characters; all the performers are expected to develop equally, making the most of their strengths. The story has no cause and effect; society is the cause, and the representation of facts is the effect. The result is very scattered and complex. This kind of writing is creative for the individual, but it is rare in both the horizontal and vertical aspects.</p>
<p>I learned that Mr. Cheng Bugao was directing the script, so I went to visit him. He said that this film was also an experiment for him. In Star's past style, it has been almost consistent, always using many actors to perform a very grand story, adopting many scenes, and shooting a very complex structure. But directing a broad social reflection in a very simple setting is unprecedented. It's like a one-act play, but it has to contain the quality of a multi-act play, which is so difficult.</p>
<p>After listening to them, I was eager to see their work. At the preview the day before yesterday, I took two full hours to appreciate it, and I felt that both of their experiments had achieved considerable success. Generally, a comedy aims to amuse people, but after watching "New and Old Shanghai," after laughing for a while, there is a bit of a stimulating bittersweet taste. From a literary and artistic standpoint, the merit of the script lies in the sharpness of the dialogue. The merit of the performance lies in the humor of the actions. So I said to Mr. Zhou Jianyun, this is your boldness!</p>
<h3>Swapped Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter One: Enjoying Tea and Having a Quiet Conversation While Listening to the Rain at the Night Window; Being Amazed by a Blossoming Branch Reflecting Fragrance in the Flower Alley</p>
<p>On that handsome face, adding a pair of crystal spectacles, two bright and radiant eyeballs, hiding an air of sharp wit under the glasses, he smiled. Guo Qi said, "You've been looking at me for a long time, suddenly smiling slightly, there seems to be something behind that." Ping Shan repeatedly tapped the floor with one foot, but his eyes were still scrutinizing Guo Qi. Guo Qi smiled and asked, "Why don't you speak? Don't you believe what I said?" Ping Shan replied, "Look, you are such a cultivated and dashing person, yet the texts you publish are always novels and notes with an air of sorrow and beauty, which are all manifestations of great tenderness. With the manifestation of tenderness, can you say there is no thought of a family in his heart?" Guo Qi smiled and said, "You've misunderstood my meaning." After saying that, he couldn't think of what to say next, so he could only raise both hands to adjust his spectacles. Then he stood up again, put the Venus statue on the table back in its place, and poured himself a cup of tea to drink. But just as he was about to pick up the cup, he put it down again and smiled slightly. Ping Shan said with a smile, "Brother Guo Qi, I see you like this, as if you have something to say. Why don't you speak it out?" Guo Qi smiled and said, "Of course, there is something to say, but if I were to say it, it would be a very long story, inevitably verbose. I think that marriage is a major event in life, and if the other party is even slightly reluctant, it would be better to have none at all. So, in my heart, that person must be like this Venus statue, pure and dustless, so that just seeing the surface, I feel a kind of admiration. This admiration must not be desire, must not be foolishness, must not be..." As he said this, he picked up the teacup on the table and put it to his lips, slowly sipping, with a slight smile, concentrating, trying to complete that sentence. Ping Shan smiled and said, "You don't need to say the rest. I already understand. It is to create a new and perfect family under pure love, nourishing your life in..." As he spoke, he raised his hand and kept scratching his ears and cheeks. Guo Qi smiled and said, "Love is a mysterious thing, which can never be described in words. Love that can be described in words is a very ordinary thing. In short, I know that my goals are set too high, and I can't find my ideal person in society. Precisely because I can't find my ideal person, I might as well be a bachelor." The conversation had already reached late at night. There were no sounds of people around, but there were raindrops blown by the wind, pattering against the branches of the trees and bamboo in the courtyard. Even though the windows in the room were all closed, a draft was constantly seeping in from the cracks in the window frames, and they both felt a kind of indescribable atmosphere. (17)</p>

<h3>Half-Hour Interview with Anna May Wong</h3>
<p>— Wu Si (Selfless)</p>
<p>On the eve of Anna May Wong's visit to Hangzhou, I unexpectedly encountered her, who had just spent the day with Hu Die, at the towering, skyscraper-like Cathay Hotel. I should now refer to her as "Anna May Wong" or "Miss Amy". I had a long conversation with her in half an hour.</p>
<p>Knowing that Miss Wong was not accustomed to hearing Shanghainese, I pulled over a friend who could speak Cantonese to introduce us to her. I then asked her questions, with the tone and demeanor of a judge or detective. I felt a bit embarrassed for myself. However, Miss Wong, who was used to social events, answered us very frankly. No matter how trivial or abrupt the questions were, she always answered with a soft and gentle voice. This interview gave us a very good impression. It also provided us with a lot of information about her past and her achievements in film. What is written below is based on her own narration.</p>
<h3>Anna May Wong's Signature</h3>
<p>I am from Taishan, Guangdong, and I am thirty years old this year. I was born in San Francisco, USA. My father's name is Liang Ren, and he has been doing business in Los Angeles, USA, running a laundry. I have seven siblings in total, and none of us are married. I am the second oldest. I have a younger brother who is teaching in Shanghai, and a younger sister who works in the customs. I started filming when I was fifteen years old. First, I signed a contract with Universal Film Company. In the past ten years, I have signed contracts with MGM, United Artists, and Paramount in the United States. In Europe, I have also signed contracts with Gaumont in England and UFA in Germany. I have filmed several films, including "The Toll of the Sea," "Piccadilly," "Shanghai Express," "Limehouse Blues," and "Java Head," but I am not very satisfied with them. This time, I came back to my homeland to see more of the actual situation in China. I hope to be able to interact with people from all walks of life in the domestic society, especially with the women in Chinese families. At the same time, I want to learn to speak Chinese more. Because when I was young, I only studied Chinese for four years, and for the rest of the past twenty years, I have been speaking American English. Chinese people in the United States can understand American English, but in China, it is not enough to speak Cantonese alone. It is necessary to be able to speak standard Mandarin. Soon, most likely next week, I will go to Beiping to spend the summer vacation, or there will be more opportunities to learn Chinese Mandarin. Most likely in September of this year, I will still have to return to Shanghai and then go to the United States. The roles I have played in films before were not very important. I obeyed the director's commands and often played Chinese women in foreign scripts. The roles I played were mostly maids or concubines. In the future, I do not want to take on such roles again. I hope that someone will use British people to write several film scripts depicting modern Chinese society or family life to provide to American companies for filming. At the same time, I also plan to contribute what I have observed during my travels to the American film industry for reference.</p>
<p>Anna May Wong, who speaks fluent foreign language, if she didn't have yellow skin, black hair, flat nose, and almond-shaped eyes, I really wouldn't believe that she was a Chinese woman.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the First Laborers' Nursery</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>For a working family or a working woman, having a child can indeed become a problem. Because once a woman has a child, she inevitably has to shoulder a considerable responsibility for nurturing and educating them. This is, of course, the duty of a general housewife, and those with sufficient wealth can hire nannies or wet nurses to take care of it. However, for working or laboring women, they cannot abandon their original jobs or careers for the sake of family finances. Hiring a wet nurse is even more unlikely. Furthermore, factories, commercial firms, and institutions in our country do not yet have "nursery rooms" or "lactation rooms" specially set up for female employees and workers like those in Europe and America. Thus, in this situation, they face the difficulty of attending to one thing and neglecting the other.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many debates about whether women should enter society or return to the family. However, I believe there is no problem with either going to the family or going to society. Anyway, there are things they should do both at home and in society. However, the first thing to consider is to ensure that both sides benefit without harm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I made a special trip to the vicinity of Banfang on Penglai Road in the Nanshi area to visit the First Laborers' Nursery founded by the city's Children's Welfare Association. I felt that it was an institution that specifically accepts entrusted childcare from laboring families and working women. Unfortunately, the scale is too small, and the number of children inside is limited, which inevitably makes people feel regretful. However, according to the authorities' original intention, they may want to expand to the first, second, third, and even ninth and tenth locations. However, to this day, a second Laborers' Nursery has yet to appear.</p>
<p>I stepped into the door, explained my intentions to a servant, and waited in the reception room. There, in addition to the photos of the members of the Children's Welfare Association, such as Wu Tiecheng, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, and Li Ting'an, there were also various slogans and regulations on the wall. Soon, Ms. Zhang, the administrator, came to lead me to visit various departments and told me about all the facilities in the center.</p>
<p>There are a total of six buildings here. The downstairs is the office, examination room, reception room, etc. Upstairs, on the left is the infant department, which has a total of thirty infants, each with a small white iron bed. All clothes and bedding are made of white flannel. They are entirely breastfed, and the monthly fee is twelve yuan. All needs and clothing are borne by the center. This department accepts babies from four months to more than ten months old. Each baby is set for a period of fifteen months, and after the period expires, the parents take them back, and new babies are accepted.</p>
<p>On the right is the children's department. In addition to the children's bedroom, exercise room, dining room, and bathroom, there is also a classroom. There are also thirty or so children there, aged two to four. The monthly fee is only two yuan, and clothes and food are provided by the center. However, they do not stay overnight at the center. The children's parents send them in at seven o'clock every morning and pick them up at six o'clock in the afternoon. As for life, they have two hours of classes every morning, three meals a day, and must take a nap for two hours from one to three o'clock in the afternoon. They change clothes every other day and take a bath at least once a week.</p>
<p>The bedroom is specially for their nap. There are more than thirty small iron beds arranged in a row, each with bedding. The light in the room is kept soft. The exercise room is filled with various toys and sports equipment. The thirty or so lively, innocent, and lovely children are playing in the room.</p>
<p>All the departments are clean and tidy, filled with an atmosphere of love and happiness. You can't hear any noise or crying inside.</p>
<p>The center employs twelve young and strong nannies and wet nurses to nurture and manage the children. Regarding health, a special doctor comes to the center every week to check the children's bodies and mouths, and those with diseases are sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>After returning from the visit, I felt that this is indeed a social undertaking worth promoting, and I hope everyone will cherish it.</p>

<h3>Research on the Science of Moxibustion (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Moxibustion is one of the ancient medical methods in our country. It is prevalent among the people, and ignorant old women can perform it. To say it is ineffective is belied by its continued transmission to this day, and the occasional appearance of remarkable effects. To say it is effective may not be entirely true. In this way, the method has been practiced for thousands of years, with everyone knowing that it is so, but not knowing why it is so. Now, from a scientific point of view, I will explain the truth of moxibustion as follows.</p>
<p>(A) The History of Moxibustion: Treating diseases by causing burns to the skin. The origin of this method probably began in ancient China. However, some people say that it originated in India, but there is no definite proof. Moxibustion is also prevalent in Japan. It was transmitted from our country in 1222 AD. During the Azuchi-Momoyama period in Japan, there were also writings on moxibustion. There should be many such writings in our country, but most of them are handwritten copies. Even those that are printed are difficult to reproduce faithfully due to the crude drawings. Moreover, almost all handwritten copies are secret books that people are unwilling to circulate. This is also a major reason for the backwardness of Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>(B) The Definition of Moxibustion: The so-called moxibustion is the method of treating diseases by placing moxa leaves on a specific point on the skin (the so-called acupuncture point) and burning it with fire.</p>
<p>(C) The Burning Temperature During Moxibustion: When moxa is burned, it can generate a temperature of 640 degrees Celsius. However, when using moxa cones and burning them on the abdominal wall of a rabbit, the average temperature is between 61 and 200 degrees Celsius. The temperature reaching under the skin, such as reaching a depth of two centimeters, can rise by about two degrees. If it reaches a depth of two and three-tenths of a centimeter, the increase is less than half a degree.</p>
<p>The above burning of moxa cones acts on the tissues of the skin, causing the proteins to coagulate to a certain extent. The coagulated proteins are gradually broken down and absorbed, resulting in a type of foreign protein reaction.</p>
<p>(D) The Effect of Moxibustion on Various Parts of the Body: Effects on Blood: Within two minutes after applying moxibustion to a rabbit, its blood is taken for examination, and an increase in white blood cells is observed, reaching 34% or even double. The cells that increase at this time are mostly neutrophils. This increase in white blood cells can continue for four or five days after the moxibustion is applied. Some people also say that red blood cells and hemoglobin also increase. In addition, the blood clotting time is shortened, and there is an increase in blood sugar. The sedimentation rate of blood cells is also increased.</p>
<p>Also, after applying moxibustion to a rabbit, taking its blood and separating its serum can prove an increase in adrenaline-like substances.</p>
<p>Effects on Blood Vessels: Blood vessels first constrict and then dilate after moxibustion.</p>
<p>Effects on Pulse: The pulse rate increases when the moxa is burning. The pulse rate remains high after the fire is extinguished until the blood vessels dilate.</p>
<p>Effects on Blood Pressure: In animal experiments, blood pressure initially rises due to the momentary stimulation of pain when moxibustion is applied. After the stimulation is removed, it drops and returns to normal within a short time. The degree of change varies depending on the type of animal and the size of the moxibustion. In humans, there are also cases of increased blood pressure, typically by 5-32 mmHg.</p>
<p>Effects on Respiration: The respiratory rate often increases, sometimes decreases, and sometimes there is no effect.</p>
<p>Effects on Intestinal Movement: Usually, after applying moxibustion, the vigorous intestinal movement is calmed down. This is probably due to the stimulation of the sympathetic nerves controlling the intestines and the effect of adrenaline-like substances.</p>
<p>Effects on Bile Secretion: When a biliary fistula is created in a rabbit and moxibustion is applied, an increase in bile secretion is observed. However, when "Atropin" is used to inhibit the sympathetic nerves, the bile secretion does not increase. This increase is probably due to the hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Effects on Muscle Strength and Fatigue: Applying moxibustion during muscle work results in increased muscle strength and rapid recovery from fatigue. This is probably due to the increased production of adrenaline.</p>
<p>Effects on the Kidneys: Experiments on rabbits show that moxibustion does not have a diuretic effect. If the degree of moxibustion is increased, leaving a large scar, proteinuria is observed.</p>
<h3>A Global Perspective on Tuberculosis Statistics (VII)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called two types of statistics, namely, the tuberculosis mortality rate for those under 30 years old, the rate for the entire territory of Germany is lower than the statistics for Prussia. From 30 to 70 years old, the two are almost equal. After 70 years old, the statistics for Prussia are lower. In the death cases under the age of five, there has been a decreasing phenomenon in both the Prussian province and the entire territory of Germany before 1930. However, there has been a tendency to increase between 1931 and 1932. The mortality rate for men during their youth working years has also gradually decreased. The mortality rate for women between the ages of five and thirty is higher than that for men.</p>
<p>The following table shows the statistics of tuberculosis mortality in various age groups of both sexes by Moellers.</p>
<p>First year: More men than women</p>
<p>Second year to tenth year: Men equal women</p>
<p>Tenth to twentieth years adolescence: More women than men</p>
<p>Twentieth to twenty-fifth years: More men than women (1882 to 1922)</p>
<p>More women than men (1923 to 1929)</p>
<p>Twenty-fifth to thirtieth years: More men than women (1882 to 1902)</p>
<p>More women than men (starting in 1913)</p>
<p>The following table shows the tuberculosis mortality statistics for both sexes in various age groups in Germany (units of 10,000 residents).</p>
<p>According to Calmette's report, the tuberculosis mortality rate for infants in a tuberculous environment is 24-80%. Lederer and Retse in Germany found only 5.1-7.1%. Goetzel in Austria and Frautz also had similar numbers, at 7%. However, Frautz proved that the tuberculosis mortality rate for infants was higher, at 16.9%. From this point of view, the average tuberculosis mortality rate for infants in tuberculous environments is not as high as previously estimated.</p>
<p>In fact, the tuberculosis mortality rate for infants in a tuberculous environment does not decrease after BCG vaccination. However, there is still a lack of large-scale statistics on this point. Looking at the infant mortality statistics in a tuberculous infectious environment in Berlin, it is not higher than elsewhere. In Düsseldorf, infants with tuberculosis infection are comparatively safer, and the statistics may even be slightly lower. In fact, on the one hand, it is due to the organization of a large number of clinics and protection centers, and on the other hand, the decline in this mortality statistic is also related to the simultaneous decrease in tuberculosis mortality and the number of births during the women's childbearing period.</p>
<p>Young children's tuberculosis mortality rates also have the same good trend. In Bonn, Frentzen performed the Moro reaction test on 393 children under the age of six in the clinic. 110 cases were negative, and 162 cases were positive, but no clinical or X-ray pathological changes were found.</p>
<p>The mortality rate for school-age children has also gradually decreased. Peretti, Kieffer, and Stephan have all provided the same evidence. What needs to be noted is that new infections in girls are more common than in boys during school age. This first tuberculosis infection is most tolerable during school age than at any other age. According to Braeuning's statistics, only 5% of school-age children have a tuberculosis infection each year, acute tuberculosis accounts for 1.8%, and open tuberculosis accounts for only 0.1%. Peretti and Simon conducted large-scale examinations in various places. Simon found that 30.3% in urban schools and 22.6% in rural schools in the Allenburg area had positive results. The reasons for this decrease in infection are partly due to the improvement of school facilities and partly due to the immediate isolation of patients after the disease is discovered. Peretti proved that 30.1% had a positive reaction to the Moro method in 1925, and only 12.5% in 1932. After leaving school life, the statistics were 54.3% in 1927 and 40.4% in 1933. From this point of view, the total transmission of tuberculosis is not in the initial period of childhood, but at a higher age. The spread of tuberculosis, whether in infancy, childhood, or school age, is mostly related to external causes, and the economic relationship of the parents is even more important.</p>
<p>Young children's tuberculosis mortality rate has been slightly increasing before 1931, but in recent years, the statistics have stopped and decreased again. Langer's clinical statistics from the Queen Victoria Hospital in Berlin from 1926 to 1931 also proved an increase in young children with tuberculosis.</p>
<p>What is the degree of danger to school-age children with teachers with open tuberculosis? The results of G:ertbmuhlen's experiment showed that 32% of a female teacher with open tuberculosis had a positive tuberculin reaction, while only 21% of healthy teachers had a positive reaction. In other experimental methods, there were also huge differences, with a ratio of 79.5% to 38.7%.</p>
<p>The mortality rate of infants at risk of tuberculosis infection in the United Kingdom has also decreased comparatively. This is Cox's report. His observation is the same as that in Germany, which is closely related to the problems of clinics, nursing homes, and nutrition. He also proved that the mortality rate between the first and second years is the same, and the mortality rate of young children aged between the second and fifth years in a tuberculous environment has increased significantly. The positive tuberculin reaction is more common in young children in a tuberculous infectious environment than in a non-tuberculous infectious environment (Schlesinger), and the largest number of infections is five years in a dangerous infectious environment and fifteen years in a non-tuberculous environment. Also, girls are often more infected than boys. The degree of infection of fathers with tuberculosis is also higher than that of mothers with tuberculosis.</p>

<h3>Common Sense on Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(Eighty-seven) Eyelid Abscess, Eyelid Boil, and Eyelid Spasm</p>
<p>Eyelid Abscess: Eyelid abscesses are mostly caused by damage to the skin of the eyelid or secondary to orbital periostitis and erysipelas. It starts with redness and swelling of the local skin. A hard knot gradually rises under the skin, causing pain. The preauricular lymph nodes are also often swollen, and sometimes fever occurs. After a while, the subcutaneous infiltration part can soften into pus. At this time, if an incision is made, the pus can be drained and cured.</p>
<p>Eyelid Boil: The cause of eyelid boils is the same as that of ordinary boils. It is also caused by the infection of staphylococcus. It usually occurs in the eyebrow area. It initially presents as a papule or pustule. The surrounding skin is red and swollen. Soon, the induration gradually increases, and the local area feels painful. In severe cases, there are chills and fever. The treatment for this disease is to first use anti-inflammatory methods. If pus points appear, an incision should be made to drain the pus.</p>
<p>Eyelid Spasm: Eyelid spasm is caused by the spasmodic contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing the patient to involuntarily close the eyelids. The causes can be divided into two types.</p>
<p>Symptomatic Eyelid Spasm - When there are foreign bodies in the conjunctival sac (such as dust blowing into the eyes), ingrown eyelashes, corneal herpes, corneal ulcers, iritis, etc., the trigeminal nerve can often be stimulated, causing a kind of reflex action, which causes the orbicularis oculi muscle to spasm. At this time, the patient's eyelids are closed and not easily opened. Tears flow frequently, making it difficult for doctors to examine the eyelids. An eyelid retractor must be used, or eye drops that reduce irritation must be instilled to achieve the purpose of examination. The treatment principle is to treat the primary disease in order to hope for recovery.</p>
<p>Idiopathic Eyelid Spasm - This disease is the primary spasm of the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is mostly caused by hysteria, so this disease is also called hysteric eyelid spasm. The spasm is particularly strong when the spirit is excited. Furthermore, an eyelid spasm that occurs in the elderly is called senile eyelid spasm. It is also a type of idiopathic spasm.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(V) Loofah Luffa cylindrica, Roem. Luffa (English)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to the tropics, it can be cultivated everywhere. It is an annual vine herb. Leaves alternate, petiolate, palmate, with sharp or shallow lobes, uneven serrated green, acute tips. Monoecious. In summer and autumn, it blooms yellow unisexual flowers, male flowers are racemose, female flowers are solitary. The berry is long cylindrical, rich in reticulated fibers.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The water that flows out when its stem is cut is the so-called "loofah water", which contains niter. Other ingredients are still unknown.</p>
<p>(Medicinal) Folk: Loofah water can be used as a cough suppressant and diuretic.</p>
<p>(Other uses) Loofah water can be used as a lotion.</p>
<p>When growing vigorously in summer, collect the above-ground stems, cut each section into 30 cm. Insert the stem opening of the upper part into a bottle to obtain loofah water. After one day and night, about 500 cc of loofah water can be obtained.</p>
<p>Loofah fiber, commonly known as "loofah sponge", can be used for various scrubbing purposes.</p>
<p>Valerianaceae</p>
<p>1. Patrinia Patrinia scabiosaefolia, Link.</p>
<p>(Plant) Self-grown in the mountains and fields, it is a perennial herb. The stem is about ——1.5 meters high. The root leaves are pinnately mid-lobed, the lobes are obovate with blunt tips. The stem leaves are opposite, pinnately deeply lobed, the lobes are narrow and long, with notched edges, and the green is like serrated teeth. Axillary corymbose inflorescences, in autumn, small yellow flowers bloom. The achene is small and long oval.</p>
<p>(Medicinal) Old sayings: Patrinia root is used to treat carbuncles, edema, and postpartum abdominal pain. Used as a decoction.</p>
<p>Prescription example: Coix Seed, Aconite, and Patrinia Powder two</p>
<p>Coix seed 4.0 Aconite 1.0 Patrinia 2.0</p>
<p>The above is made into a decoction of 100, to be taken as a single dose.</p>
<p>2. Valerian Valeriana officinalis, L. Tar. Angustifolia, Mig.</p>
<p>(Plant) Self-grown in the mountains and can be cultivated. It is a perennial herb. The stems and leaves are slender. The leaves are opposite, with three to five pairs of pinnately completely lobed lobes. The lobes are linear lanceolate with blunt serrated edges. Terminal umbellate inflorescences, small light red flowers bloom in early summer. The fruits are small and have pappus.</p>
<p>Western valerian V. Officinalis, L. is not much different from valerian, except that the lobes of the leaves are quite narrow.</p>
<p>Mountain valerian V. Fincidissima, Maxim. is similar in shape to valerian, slightly smaller, and has soft creeping branches. The roots have a very slight valerian odor. Not for medicinal use.</p>
<p>(Cultivation method) Start dividing the plants in early October, with a bed width of two feet, and a spacing of about one foot between each plant. In May and June of the following year, carry out two cultivations. Fertilizers include compost, basal fertilizer, and rice bran. In early May, the flower spikes are extracted, and at this time, cut off the stem three inches from the ground to promote the growth of the roots. Harvest in late August, with a yield of about 100 catties of fresh roots per mu.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) Valerian Root Rhizoma Valeriance is made by collecting and drying the rhizomes and roots. The rhizome is 2 cm long and 1 cm thick, with buds and residual stems at the upper end. The surrounding roots are about 2 mm thick and about 20 cm long, and the roots are mostly branched. The surface is yellowish-brown or dark brown, and the texture is brittle. This product has a unique pungent aroma and a slightly spicy taste.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A on Teeth (31)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 149) Why shouldn't we eat foods that are too cold or too hot?</p>
<p>Answer: Foods that are too cold or too hot have excessive stimulating power, and the dental pulp is easily affected. It is not advisable to eat them often.</p>
<p>(Question 150) Why are acidic foods harmful to teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Overly acidic foods such as sour fruits and vinegar can directly erode the dental enamel. It is not advisable to eat them often. If you eat them occasionally, you must rinse your mouth afterward.</p>
<p>(Question 151) Are sugary foods as harmful as ordinary people imagine?</p>
<p>Answer: Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, just like rice and wheat. It does not directly damage teeth. If you say that sugar is harmful to teeth and should not be eaten, then rice and wheat should not be eaten either! However, the residue left in the mouth when eating sugar, like the residue from rice and noodles, is very easy to ferment and turn sour. Acidity can dissolve the dental enamel. If you eat it at the right time, eat it with other things during meals, and brush your teeth afterward, then sugary foods will not be harmful. However, it is better for those who do not brush their teeth after eating to eat less.</p>
<p>(Question 152) What should be paid attention to in the diet during pregnancy?</p>
<p>Answer: During pregnancy, teeth are more prone to decay due to the loss of lime in the body. At this time, you should eat more nutritious foods. Products rich in lime and vitamin D are quite suitable.</p>
<p>Section 5: Overall Health and Other Considerations</p>
<p>(Question 153) How does overall poor health affect teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: People with declining health mostly have poor nutrition, and their metabolism is out of balance. There is too much oxygen in the body, the dental enamel deteriorates, and the resistance is weak. Saliva also often becomes abnormal, even becoming acidic, losing the function of protecting teeth. Tooth decay and other dental problems are prone to occur. Tooth problems can further weaken the body. Therefore, statistically speaking, most of the people who seek treatment for dental problems from dentists are unhealthy.</p>
<p>(Question 154) Why do many people in the countryside have healthy teeth even though their diet is poor and they do not pay attention to oral hygiene?</p>
<p>Answer: People in rural areas work at sunrise and rest at sunset. Their lives are very natural and simple, and there are very few things that harm their health. They can also get sunlight and fresh air, so their bodies are relatively healthy and have fewer diseases. Therefore, their teeth also have relatively strong resistance and are not easily decayed. Many teeth of savage tribes and ancient people were very intact, which was also due to their good health.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (89)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>How should the sputum of patients with this disease be disposed of? Its sole purpose, of course, is to eradicate the tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum! As mentioned above, tuberculosis bacteria are highly resistant and extremely difficult to kill. Therefore, before detailing various eradication methods, it is necessary to understand the true state of their resistance. Their (tuberculosis bacteria's) resistance to dryness, putrefaction, and cold is astonishing. In ordinary dry places, the lifespan of tuberculosis bacteria in sputum can extend to more than nine months; naturally, there are slight differences depending on sunlight exposure and the thickness of the sputum layer. Generally, thicker sputum clumps last longer than thinner layers, and those without sunlight exposure last longer than those with sunlight exposure; the longest survival occurs in dark corners of rooms where thick clumps form. Secondly, resistance to putrefaction is much weaker than the former, but it still takes at least several days to die. Thirdly, bacteria are generally indifferent to cold; in fact, it is the best condition for preserving their lives, completely different from humans who cannot tolerate cold and freeze to death. Tuberculosis bacteria are no exception. Even after being subjected to ten degrees below freezing point for six weeks, their infectivity remains unchanged. In addition, one thing must be stated incidentally: many people bury the sputum-contaminated clothing of patients in the soil, believing that tuberculosis bacteria will die as a result; this is completely wrong. Because there is no sunlight or air in the soil, it is difficult for putrefaction to occur; on the contrary, it becomes the best condition for their survival. According to expert reports, viable tuberculosis bacteria can still be found in the lungs of patients who have been buried in the soil for more than two years, which gives us a glimpse of the situation!</p>
<p>How can tuberculosis bacteria be killed? The methods currently used in medicine are roughly limited to: disinfectants and bactericides; heating; and utilizing sunlight. Details of these aspects will now be described below:</p>
<p>Disinfectants and bactericides: Carbolic acid is the most common bactericide, but if it is mixed with sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria, it takes a long time; approximately 5% carbolic acid solution requires at least 24 hours to kill the tuberculosis bacteria. Pure alcohol is similar, but the amount of alcohol must be more than ten times the amount of sputum to be effective. Concentrated mercuric chloride solution takes less time, but its effect is difficult to reach the center of the sputum, so many people do not advocate its use. Alkalysol, a preparation of Kresal, has been widely used recently; approximately 5% solution requires about four hours at ordinary temperature; if heated to 80 degrees Celsius, it only takes half an hour; for washing, a 2% solution is sufficient. Gb. Bacillol is also a preparation of Kresal, and its function is roughly the same as the former, with a dosage of 5% solution. Chloramin is also popular because it has no odor; a 10% solution is needed, requiring six hours; if used to wipe the floor (in the patient's room), 1% is sufficient. For sputum attached to fingers or clothing, washing the area with a thousandth concentration of mercuric chloride or a 5% carbolic acid solution can kill most of the tuberculosis bacteria immediately. For fingers suspected of having bacteria attached, simply washing them thoroughly with water and soap, along with disinfectant solution, can achieve the purpose of disinfection; this is a very simple method that can be implemented by senders and those who are close to patients every time and everywhere.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>The Problem of Bank Loans</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>Member Ma Yinchu of the Legislative Yuan’s opinion on the rural revival plan includes a request for bank loans, saying: “The general opinion in the city is that the Central Bank should consider lowering bank loan interest rates from the perspective of the city's economy. However, lowering bank loan interest rates will also cause the interest rates on deposits to be lowered at the same time. Currently, foreign banks in China have raised deposit interest rates to six or seven percent. If domestic banks lower deposit interest rates, there is a risk of capital flowing into foreign banks, which should be considered carefully.”</p>
<p>China's financial industry is built on speculative businesses like government bonds and real estate, rather than on the development of industry; that is to say, it does not take industry as its foundation. This can be seen from bank loans. “Lowering bank loan interest rates will also cause the interest rates on deposits to be lowered at the same time.” However, if the interest rate on bank deposits increases, then the interest rate on bank loans will naturally increase as well. Once the lending rate increases, almost all industrial and commercial operators will be unable to borrow from banks, and the banks themselves, due to the semi-colonial nature of China's industry and commerce in the context of this global economic downturn, are also a little uneasy about industry and commerce. Therefore, the two are alienated from each other, that is, Chinese financial capital and industry and commerce.</p>
<p>If Chinese financial capital and industry and commerce are so alienated, then can Chinese financial capital be closely integrated with the vast masses of poor farmers in the hopelessly bankrupt rural areas? Since the interest rate on bank deposits cannot be lowered, and the interest rate on bank loans is of course unwilling to be lowered, the vast masses of poor farmers are still unable to obtain loans. And even if they do borrow money, they may fall into an even deeper debt pit in the future and be unable to extricate themselves. The tragic scene at that time can be seen simply by closing one's eyes. What is meant by the so-called "reviving the countryside"?</p>
<p>The problem lies here: “Currently, foreign banks have raised deposit interest rates to six or seven percent. If domestic banks lower deposit interest rates, there is a risk of capital flowing into foreign banks.” International financial capital is constantly tripping up our Chinese financial capital. If you want to move your hand or foot, or even twitch your eyeball, it will cause him</p>
<p>If we want Chinese financial capital to provide a little timely rain in this bankrupt countryside, or even cooperate well with our industry and commerce, the most fundamental thing is to get rid of the one who is tripping us up first!</p>
<h3>May</h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>The hot blood of Wen Kete flowed through his parched veins. He seemed to hear a torrent of roaring people, flooding every gap in the city of Chicago; he seemed to see thousands upon thousands of people's rough, dark fists waving before his eyes. However, when the singing from the basement suddenly stopped, he couldn't help but look around in surprise. His fantasy vanished, and the crowd and the roar disappeared into a vortex of silence and darkness. At this time, he felt a little anxious, as if a flame was burning in his heart. Due to the illusion, his nostrils inhaled a strong smell of alcohol. It greedily and powerfully attracted him. He reached into the pocket of his torn coat, feeling two smooth, fifty-cent silver coins, which were the bread for him and his family for three days. However, before he had time to think about it, he lifted his resolute steps and pushed open the basement door.</p>
<p>The basement was now darkly filled with people, a group of rough, dark, dirty people! Some were half drunk, some were completely drunk, some were young, some were old, there were men and women. This was a group of unfortunate people, oppressed by life. They raised their rough, dark fists and roared loudly for their misfortune.</p>
<p>"Brothers! What gift has President Roosevelt's economic recovery law given everyone? The huge unemployment of thirty million people!" A young man pounded the table with his fist, roaring angrily.</p>
<p>"And I've been unemployed for two whole years!" An aging little old man sighed in a painful and weak voice.</p>
<p>"Drink! Brothers, drink hard!"</p>
<p>"Come! This is our last cup!"</p>
<p>Wen Kete ran to the counter, ordered a bottle of strong ale, and secretly ran to a shady corner to drink it. The stimulation of the strong alcohol did not give him much waiting. His head became heavy, and his two dry eyes overflowed with bloodshot flames.</p>
<p>Night, with black wings, slipped away. It was when the last drop was left in his glass that he became blurred, and he felt that the world was burning. But a thought, a terrible horror seized him, when he reached into his pocket and groped, he discovered that he had committed a great crime. He had drunk the bread of his wife and children. They were hungry, crying, waiting for his return, waiting for his smooth, lovely two fifty-cent silver coins; but he had drunk it all. He thought of it, and he trembled slightly. His ears were as if stuffed with something, and he could not hear any sound; his eyes were as if blurred by something, and he could not see anything, only his wife's fierce face, her rude scolding, and the children's crying and faint moans of hunger...</p>
<p>He stood up from his seat sadly, stunned, and the cup he was holding fell to the ground unnaturally, ringing sharply and shattering.</p>
<h3>Sealing the Door</h3>
<p>— Chen Ji</p>
<p>As the morning light peeked out from the dim clouds, furtively crawling into Sister-in-law A Gen’s narrow and turbid little room, Sister-in-law A Gen’s heart was almost leaping out of her chest, and she couldn’t help but cry out.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Ah! It's the fifteenth!..."</p>
<p>Her whole body felt like it had been thrown into a fire, suffering from feverish pain, and she thought of her husband.</p>
<p>He hadn't had anything to do for more than a year, just loafing around at home, either quarreling with her or beating his six-year-old child, Mao Mao. Everything in the house had been pawned off! They lived day by day in hunger, cold, anxiety, and worry.</p>
<p>They were in debt; they were “second landlords,” using the rent collected from “third tenants” to temporarily fill their stomachs. In this way, the rent had been vacant for a full eight months.</p>
<p>"Mr. Accountant: Thank you, please help me, I'm about to have business! I will pay it off..."</p>
<p>A Gen said with very humble and pleading words, and the accountant left in a burst of restrained anger. They did not dare to use the rent collected from the third tenants to fill their stomachs again, and they borrowed from wherever they could borrow, borrow, borrow... but the rent was still in arrears for eight months.</p>
<p>"Ah! This is heaven helping us, isn't it." When Sister-in-law A Gen heard A Gen say very happily: "There's a letter from Hankou, there's a job in the cigarette factory there!" Her head tilted up to the sky, and a strong religious feeling suddenly arose in her heart.</p>
<p>Managing to borrow travel expenses, A Gen set off with a heart full of hope. He had said to his wife: "Take good care of the children. If things go well there, I will come to pick you up to live there with me." Sister-in-law A Gen shed tears of joy as she sent off her husband.</p>
<p>But a month, two months... the money A Gen sent back was still not enough to fill her and her children's stomachs, and the rent was still eight months in arrears. A Gen had not yet told her in his letters: "The factory business is very slow, not to mention night work, even day work, sometimes only two days a week can be done..." But the accountant did not know this hardship, and he came with bodyguards, saying so angrily:</p>
<p>"Now that your man has business! If you don't pay three months by the fifteenth, we're going to seal the door! The court ruled it long ago, didn't it? I only treated you leniently because I saw that your man had no business!"</p>
<p>Sister-in-law A Gen was so anxious that she quickly wrote a letter to A Gen there, but she received A Gen's reply: saying to discuss it with the accountant, and as soon as the business improved, he would definitely pay three months...</p>
<p>Sister-in-law A Gen led her two sons, and personally ran to the accountant's office to plead, but the answer she got: was still those few stern words.</p>
<p>But today is the fifteenth! Sister-in-law A Gen was sobbing and weeping. A six-year-old and a three-year-old, the two children's slight snores were playing in harmony with their mother's crying: how desolate the morning air was!</p>
<p>The fifteenth filled the earth with sunshine. The children were dragging Sister-in-law A Gen, wanting breakfast, but she was lost and bewildered, just staring at them with her red and swollen eyes.</p>
<p>The tenants told Sister-in-law A Gen to move out some furniture, but she did nothing, just like she was crazy, her chest rising and falling rapidly, and she stared blankly at the people surrounding her.</p>
<p>Finally, the misfortune that brought her ruin arrived. The accountant rushed in, followed by a bailiff, the doorman carrying wooden boards, silver heads, and the accountant shouted sternly:</p>
<p>"How's the rent?"</p>
<p>"Help me, please..."</p>
<p>"Seal the door! Seal the door!"</p>
<p>The bailiff dragged Sister-in-law A Gen out. The doorman nailed the wooden boards crisscrossed on the door, and her room was also sealed at the same time. The tenants were given three days to move out. At this time, Sister-in-law A Gen seemed to wake up, sitting in the alley, crying and screaming, and the two children were also crying and shouting by her side:</p>
<p>"Mommy! Mommy!..."</p>
<p>A large group of people surrounded her, as if sympathizing with her, and as if watching a spectacle.</p>
<h3>Dust</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>In the morning, at the entrance of that noisy little teahouse, I met that strange "Mr. Lu" again; this time, he was no longer aimlessly wandering the streets with a sorrowful expression, or mentioning his "eighty-year-old mother" in a voice that seemed about to cry—this time, he was serious, as if he was in a hurry, looking out at the entrance of the little teahouse as if he was expecting something. When he saw me, he just nodded in surprise and turned away, looking at the traffic and people coming and going on the street as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>I sized up that middle-aged man I had always called "Mr. Lu": I felt that, as he himself had said before, "I will finally fall from the tower of life one day," and now, perhaps he had really fallen from the "tower of life." He was wearing even more tattered clothes than before, and he had an even more withered appearance than before: "In short, life is getting worse day by day..."</p>
<p>However, the tower of life is steep and dangerous, and no one can guarantee that they won't fall one day! Yes, that strange "Mr. Lu," I watched him fall from life day by day, and I also saw his "attempts" at life, but "people will finally end so quickly"...</p>
<p>I met "Mr. Lu" in the attic of a house. Because we lived in the same house, because we met every morning and evening, we started by nodding to each other indifferently, then greeting each other, smiling, and saying a few usual idle words; in this way, we strangely became "acquainted"...</p>
<p>Everyone felt that this thin, vague "Mr. Lu" was a bit strange. It was said that he taught in a small school, earning twelve dollars a month. He taught seven or eight hours of classes every night, and used these twelve dollars, which were paid once every three months (!), to maintain the lives of three people besides himself: an eighty-year-old mother and two dirty children...</p>
<p>I never heard him mention the children's mother, and no one ever asked him about "Mrs. Lu." Only one summer evening, ten coppers of shochu had intoxicated his nerves, and he angrily cursed his woman, saying that "she looks down on poor men, leaves two children behind, and runs to rich young masters to be a mistress, shameless, this world, this world..."</p>
<p>But when he woke up the next day, he seemed to have forgotten everything and no longer mentioned it. And people no longer had the leisure to ask about things he didn't want to talk about...</p>
<p>In this way, day after day, Mr. Lu lived in endless frustration, living in worry. Late at night, he would quietly prepare a little for tomorrow's night classes, reading the sentences in "Qiu Shui Xuan Ruler" over and over again, shaking his head and wagging his tail, and also checking the "classics" he didn't know in a dilapidated "Ci Yuan" that he only had; however, after the school owed him four months' salary, even that dilapidated "Ci Yuan" was sold to the old bookstore for three cents...</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Lu and his "family" were also driven away for owing several months' rent. When he left, he seemed to realize something, and said in a distorted way: "Life is originally a long and steep road. As you walk, people become covered in dust—as long as there is something that can make life better, I will even do it as a robber... People must be slaves to life."</p>
<p>I thought maybe "Mr. Lu" would go crazy, but he didn't go crazy, because later, I met him again and again at the entrance of that little teahouse on the street corner. He had changed his appearance, and maybe he was really "making life better"...</p>
<p>Really! In the third month, when I passed the entrance of that little teahouse, someone told me that Mr. Lu had done something unclear and had been arrested to face a lawsuit.</p>
<p>I understood that maybe this was his "effort" towards life? However, no matter what, I understood him. On the road of life, he was truly a weary traveler covered in dust.</p>
<h3>The Story of Raising Birds</h3>
<p>— Qi Quan</p>
<p>After my eldest brother returned to the family, he completely changed as a person. The spirit of perseverance, courage, and progress that he used to have could hardly be found at all; on the contrary, he burned incense and chanted Buddha, like an old Buddhist grandmother who cultivates for the afterlife. My father had tried to seize the occasional opportunity when Xian was excited to inquire about his whereabouts during his years of wandering outside, but whenever my father mentioned this matter, he immediately became depressed, and his bloodshot eyes silently stared at a couplet that promoted abstinence from killing and cultivating blessings: that couplet was also specially hung by him in the guest hall. After some time like this, he would quietly slip out of the guest hall, and no one in the family dared to ask about those things again, only wanting him to do happy things. At that time, the family hired a new cook, who liked to raise pigeons. One summer evening, everyone was enjoying the cool in the courtyard, and the cook unintentionally talked about his experience in raising pigeons, and my eldest brother started talking to him. Every day after dinner, he followed the cook to tea houses and searched for pigeons to buy. My father saw that my eldest brother was happy, and he also mustered his old spirits and built a pigeon shed in a corner of the courtyard. Sometimes he went to the tea house, helping my eldest brother carry the pigeon cage, or ran to the countryside a few miles away to release the pigeons. At that time, the pigeons were the supreme guests in the family, and the work of sweeping the shed and hatching eggs was entrusted to the cook, with special instructions for the servants to pay attention to cats and dogs approaching the pigeon shed to harm their peace.</p>

<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The three of us, father and sons, sat in front of the courtyard every day as if it were a job, watching the white animals flying in the air, watching them whisper affectionately on the corners of the roof, watching them raise their children in the shed. At first, it was my eldest brother who was happy to raise pigeons, and everyone followed him, but later everyone became interested. In less than half a year, we were the pigeon shed with the most pigeons in the countryside.</p>
<p>Due to the interest in those little animals, my eldest brother gradually regained his former attitude. The only difference was that he had become a lively, almost mischievous big child. The interest in raising pigeons expanded to raising all kinds of birds. And that cook, he had some experience in raising birds. As long as my eldest brother thought of something, he could talk endlessly about the method of capturing that kind of bird, how to raise it, and what shape it was of the highest quality. Although he had many reckless statements, my father hoped to please my eldest brother. During the years my eldest brother was away from home, he hardly had a smile every year. (To be continued)</p>

His pitiful and miserable cries did not move the hearts of the doctors and nurses. They just said that they were used to hearing it and that there was nothing special about it!</p>
<p>The older sister has been sick for several years because she was too deeply traumatized! Her will has completely disappeared! She can only wait for the coming of the Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>The younger sister's toe was injured, so she came here for treatment. When she entered the hospital, the doctor promised that she could be discharged in three days. However, it has been three weeks now, and her toe is still the same as when she entered the hospital. Therefore, the younger sister can't stand this dull and monotonous environment. She hopes to get out of here as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, the older sister took sleeping pills and died! She left a letter to her younger sister, hoping to reform the hospital's poor organization and build a reasonable public hospital to benefit the masses!</p>

<p>The Master said, "To learn and at due times to repeat what one has learnt, is that not also a pleasure?</p>
<p>To have friends coming from distant quarters, is not that also delightful?</p>
<p>To be not displeased when men do not know one, is not that also the part of a superior man?"</p>
<p>There being filial piety and fraternal submission, it is rare for one who has them to be fond of offending against his superiors. There never has been a man fond of offending against his superiors, and at the same time fond of stirring up confusion.</p>
<p>The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission, are they not the root of all benevolent actions?</p>
<p>The Master said, "Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue."</p>

<h3>Three Pairs of Artists</h3>
<p>Reception for Friends and Relatives at the YMCA Today at 8:30 PM</p>
<p>Zhao Dan and Ye Lucy; Tang Na and Lan Ping; Gu Eryi and Du Mingjie, the three couples originally planned to hold their wedding at the Lasx Dance School on North Sichuan Road, but because the negotiation procedures were not proper, many friends and movie fans were left empty-handed that day.</p>
<p>On the 26th of last month, they quietly went to the Six Harmonies Pagoda in Hangzhou with the officiant, Mr. Shen Junru, to hold the wedding ceremony. According to friends who saw them off, they only stayed in Hangzhou for one night. After returning to Shanghai, they decided to invite friends and relatives to a reception at the YMCA on Baisen Road on the 3rd of this month; however, the plan changed again temporarily. It is now confirmed that they will invite friends and relatives to a tea party at the YMCA today at 8:30 PM, with entertainment.</p>
<p>The entertainment that has been arranged includes: the prelude by the Pathé Records band, the ensemble, solo performance, and singing by the National Conservatory of Music, He Luting, and others. Finally, the three couples will jointly perform the play "In the Reception Room." The script is very interesting, the characters in the play are also six, and they are three pairs of lovers. The screenwriter is said to be Tang Na, one of the newlyweds. It is expected that the YMCA will be very lively today.</p>
<h3>"New and Old Shanghai" Has a Booming Box Office</h3>
<p>The Star Film Company's great production of the year, "New and Old Shanghai," which broke the silence of the film industry for several months, has been deeply loved by people from all walks of life since its premiere, and therefore, viewers have flocked to it, creating an unprecedented scene. The film's style is unique, with laughter, anger, sorrow, and joy all reaching a fantastic realm, depicting the various faces of people in society under the depressed market. Wang Xianzhai and Shu Xiuwen are best suited to play such roles. It is very interesting to see their two attitudes of pretending to be poor when rich and flaunting wealth when poor. The film is full of gimmicks and laughter. Director Cheng Bugao's skills are indeed extraordinary. Those who have not seen it should watch it as soon as possible.</p>
