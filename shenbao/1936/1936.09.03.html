<h3>冀察减稅之傳聞</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>日前外電傳來。冀察政務委員會對於冀東偽組織區城輸入之貨物。擬就天津。北平。張家口。保定。石家莊。搶州。泊頭鎭。徒口等八處。設立稽查處所。徵收按照中國海關正稅八分之一之消費稅。准在冀察兩省及平津兩巿自由搬運云云。而據昨日報載。截至一日晚八時止。財部尙未接。冀察地方當局之通知。亦未據華北海關之正式報告。此說尙在疑似之中。然而消息南來。前日本埠棉布市塲。已受影響。蓋此項消息如確。不惟華北去路。將被排擠。卽華中銷塲。亦遭波及。因是津帮採辦頓見萎縮。此恐不僅棉布一業為然也。</p>
<p>但揆諸冀察地方當局之歷來言行。則含有破壞關稅行政統一性質之消費稅。就地縱有收入。斷不肯輕易出此。查欲减輕民衆之負担。使其經濟能力有生氣。决非减輕進口洋貨稅率所能濟事。减輕洋貨之進口稅。雖在專喜使用洋貨之中國民衆。一時或許有利。而其極無非鞏固洋貨之勢力。摧殘我固有之工業。阻礙我民族經濟之復興。此其害。常人類能知之矣。冀察地方當局寗有見不及此。以是知所傳之非其眞也。</p>
<p>雖然。力謀减低我國進口稅則。實為某方旣定遂行方針之一。大量走私。卽其一端。今見走私之防範日嚴。志不得逞。轉而利用其他方式。遂其企圖。亦事勢所必至。吾人尙不忍見我國之紡織業。淪於外人之手。寗能坐視將來一切產業。皆非我有。則稍為大局計。為自身後裔計。凡足以妨礙我民族之生存者。宜必抱定生死以之之弘願。不屈不撓。據理力爭。為國家民族多保存一分元氣當亦人心之所同也。</p>
<p>貨物尙流通。故物價常能自劑於平。若限定某貨於某區域內行使。求睹理論為不通。求諸事實為難能。以是知徵收消費稅之貨物。僅限於冀察區域內行使為不可信。惟其如是。我國工商業再不可習故安常。僅以呼籲集會為可抵抗外來之經濟侵略。人方挾其實力著著進逼。吾人若不埋頭苦幹。依然如書生做文章。說過算了人不亡我。亦將自斃。我一般國民。亦再不可如隔岸觀火徒責人以所難。而自忘其責任之重大。蓋處今日之局勢。能有具堅忍不拔之精神。團結一致。苦幹實做。或有轉機之望耳。</p>

<h3>日本的對華國策　從軍事的轉向到外交的　從政治的轉向到經濟的</h3>
<p>東京通信、我們到了東京之後、最普遍聽見的呼聲、便是「確立外交國策」、我們看來、實在是意外的、難到在九一八以前、日本沒有「外交國策」麽、從九一八到現在、日本還是沒有「外交國策」麽、如果眞是沒有、那麽在這五年中、日本外交工作、是靠甚麽來指導呢、從「焦土外交」到「協和外交」、日本不是在世界舞台上、充分表示過他的外交指導精神罷、我們越推敲越不懂、經過許多觀察之後、我們才得到了一個結論、所謂「確立外交國策」的呼聲、是從下列兩種觀念發生出來的、第一、有一部分識者深刻感覺現有的外交國策、是含有許多危險性的、非根本改造、必然的要遭遇極大難關、第二、有一部分識者也痛切感覺要推行現有的外交國策、非同時擴張海陸空三大軍備不可、軍費負担過重、產業的發展、當然要受嚴重的壓榨、並且其他必要的行政、也要受經費困難的影響、不能迅速實現、所以要求改變外交國策、這兩種觀念下所用的「確立」二字、實在是「改變」或「改造」的代名詞、</p>
<p>日本現行的外交國策是甚麽、這一問可使我們為難了、外交國策本來是含有秘密性的、當然不是我們所能够知道的、但是從國家行動看來、也未　不可以推測出片鱗半爪的、日本外交國策　從對蘇對華對英對美　的態度去仔細觀察、似乎不至於不能明白、這是用不着我們來加以說明的、最近有田外相在閣議上、間接答覆社會上要求確定外交國策的說明、雖然不甚詳盡、也可以看得出他的趨勢了、有田外相說、「我們是有外交國策的、我們以對蘇為外交國策的中心、對華政策、因與對蘇有關係所以也得愼重處理　同時陸軍方面也說　日本外交國策早已確定了、現在只是實行問題、武力是外交的基本條件、所以不可不擴張軍備」、外陸兩方的說法、都是很明白的但是有田外相所說的話、只說了一面、還有一面是意在言外的、我們看來在軍事方面、當然是以對蘇為中心的、在政治經濟方面、當然是以對華為中心的、對蘇對華、是互為因果的、因為要對蘇、所以要愼重對華、因為要對華、所以要愼重對蘇、再進一步說、對華政策是日本外交國策的中心、對蘇對英對美的政策、皆由此而生的、稍為研究點最近六十年來日本外交史的人們、都可以斷言的、所以我們明白了日本對華政策、便可以認識日本外交國策的全部、</p>
<p>西南事件解决後、日本人士對華觀念漸有轉變、這是事實的、向來他們以為中國絕對沒有統一的能力永遠在混亂之中、所以日本不必以整個國家的觀念來觀察中國、所有種種對華政策、皆由此基本理論而來、可是最近因為廣東勢力崩潰的太快、而五年以來、內亂差不多絕跡了、統一的事業、現在已經達到九成程度、才漸漸認識中國統　的前途、沒有多大難關、團結的力量也不弱、所以　會上要求再檢討對華政策的呼聲不約而同、一齊發生了、我們要舉幾個實例來給讀者看、　高木陸郞氏是日本資本家中有數的「中國通」、他在八月十五日「外交時報」上做了一篇「最近中國之動靜」、又在九月號「文藝春秋」上、做了一篇「蔣介石之資金網」、兩文大意相同、列舉近年中國鐵路·公路·航空·銀行制度·幣制改革郵政儲金·政治統制·科學的應用等等的進步、希望日本人士從新再認識中國、他說「只知道舊中國的人們、論議日本對華政策、反而使日本錯誤、這是我常有的感想、　十河信二氏是經營河北的與中公司社長、也是一位「中國通」、他在九月號「文藝春秋」上做了一篇「對華政策的　的轉變」、他說「日本若只要有求必應、那就不必說、假若要認中國是我們兄弟之邦、互相提挈、安定東亞、增進人們福祉、那麽過去對華政策不能不說是失敗的、日本要求中國反省、同時日本也應該淸算過去一切的一切、復還於白紙狀態、對華政策、從第一步改造起最為必要」、他又說「總而言之、在日本軍人也罷、外交官也罷、民間研究者也罷、中國專門家也罷、他們不從世界大局觀察、把中國問題認做世界問題、僅僅侷促於四百餘州內、觀察中國、討論中國、這是根本的錯誤、他們不但忘了世界、並且在中國也沒有充分與中國國民接觸、他們的對象、只是軍閥的實力者、以及國民所敵視的土豪劣紳式資本家買辦之流而已、甚至以為茍可以操縱他們、供日本目前的利用、便自信是對華政策、」這是很公正的議論、　日本名記者太田宇之助氏在九月號「日本評論」上、寫了一篇「中國將完成其統一大業、」最後結論說、「中國若無平和、則東亞無平和、中國若不統一、則中國無平和、中國若無完全獨立、則中日兩國無眞正提携、今日正為日本改變中國觀乃至世界觀的時機」、我們認為這是不朽的名言、這種論調、在最近五年間、絕對沒有看見過的、　石丸藤太氏是日本海軍軍人中有名的評論家、（現已退伍）、新著「次回世界大戰」一書、討論今後世界大戰的原因在那裏、在「診察日蘇華關係」一章中、他說「國際關係、只有利害關係、而推動利害關係的中心、就是外交上的欲取姑與原則（Give　and　take）換句話說、「與」和「取」能保持均衡時、兩國間才可以維持親善關係、如其不然、關係必然疏遠、終至有「取」無「與」、演成敵對關係、……中日間不能保持「與」「取」均衡狀態、中國採取以夷制夷政策、豈不是當然的麽、因此要求中國反省、眞是不知道外交常軌的門外漢的胡說、」他在「太平洋戰爭可以避免麽」一章中、又說「或說國民政府的親日是假的、请看立刻就要脱下假面、再抗日起来、好像看透了蒋氏的肚子、大声疾呼、力！力！对華、力是第一、只有用力、才能壓伏中國、從頭就是打架神氣、那還有甚麽轉向不轉向、可說根本上外交就沒有用處、還說甚麽中日親善工作、這種意見互相對立、形成二重外交、眞是日本的不幸、」這位的論鋒、眞是銳利極了、他又說「次回世界戰爭、中國站在那一方面、這是看日本態度而定的、如果中日眞能達到提携目的、日美日蘇戰爭、或且都可以避免、無論在任何塲合、日本態度是决定的要素、」眼光遠大、觀察透澈、我們只有感佩而已、向來對於中國問題、好像抱有一種成見的大阪每日和東京日日兩新聞、最近半月以來、也逐漸有些轉向、這不是暗示一種時勢的轉變麽、可是讀者不要太樂觀、這種議論、雖然漸漸在社會上可以看得見、但要在外交上政治上獲得决定力量、恐怕時機還沒有成熟呢、</p>
<p>我們引證了許多議論、似乎把本題撇開了、那麽日本政府對華政策的實質、究竟有無轉變呢、從軍事的轉向到外交的工作、從政治的轉向到經濟的工作、這是很明顯的、川越大使到任的第一聲、便是」經濟提携論」、有田外相就任後、也强調「經濟外交」的必要、這都很値得我們注意的、日本在通商方面、現在遭遇了許多難關、到處是碰壁的、假使不從經濟方面開闢一條出路、不特國際貿易立受深大的影響、就是國內工商也要受連帶的惡化、注重河北的經濟開發、這是一個原因、利用河北富源、來充實日本廣義的國防、增進日本的工商業、這是再得策沒有了、日本對華觀念最近似乎有點不同、西南問題是一個極大關鍵、他們知道中國不是「吳下阿蒙」、中央統制力是强大了、整個國家的形態是具備了、以各個地方為主體的外交工作時代已經過去了、中國的對象、只有一個國民政府、所以解决懸案、减低關稅的要求、經濟合作方法等等、都要依外交途徑來協商了、恢復外交常軌、這不能不說是初步的改善、日本感覺外交一元化的必要、其程度或與中國相等、外交一元化問題、雖為三十年來懸案、但就最近五年事實來看、兩國識者尤痛切的感覺糾正是刻不容緩的、在廣田時代曾經努力過、可惜沒有多少成效、在有田時代、當然更須努力求其實現、在現時情勢之下、一元化程度、似乎做到了七成、還有一點癥結、沒有完全打通、現時在內閣以內、外陸海三相每週於閣議散會後、必定聚談對華對蘇問題、常常討論、意見自易一致、一元化的環境、比從前好多了、若中央與在外的能够完全一致、則一元化的外交便可實現了、我們切望中日兩國先恢復外交常態、然後再談具體問題、恐怕日本許多識者也是抱同一意見的罷、今日國人要問日本對華國策究竟如何、我們只有一個答覆、名記者大田氏說、「中國有完全的獨立、中日才有眞正的提携、」同一筆法、我們要說「中國有整個的國家、日本才有合理的對華國策、」</p>

<p>不料至八月甘日、自訴人偕母親赴怡和洋行絲頭部被吿辦公處、窺見其所僱之帳房手持存德戶交通銀行往來摺一扣、狀頗不安、母親見係家產、詢以何為、答稱交付錫鈞先生、母親卽向受下、查閱之下、發覺被吿乘懋棠公病篤時、自五月甘一日起至六月二日止、憑摺支取欵項、有六萬三千元之鉅、查該欵非惟未曾</p>
<p>依法分析</p>
<p>且在分析家庭合同內幷無隻字道及、甚屬大惑不解、核其所為、已犯刑法三三五條第一項之罪、故特起訴云云、繼由被吿辯護律師徐士浩、起稱、查原吿所控、均屬不實、因該項存摺上所付者、均為代之繭欵、後已陸續</p>
<p>收還舊款</p>
<p>故所有存摺上之一切欵項、早已在七月七日分析家產時結算淸楚、倘有未淸之欵、則被吿之兄弟二人、豈能不出而主張、此點可向交通銀行調查云云、庭諭本案候改期七天、仰自訴人到案再核、</p>

<h3>為調整中國佛教會　告全國僧尼</h3>
<p>— 張廷灝</p>
<p>中國佛敎會、從成立到現在、雖則也有若干的歷史、然而其組織始終沒有健全、大部份的僧尼、都沒有加入、其中常然未必沒有一二智德兼備的僧尼、為個人修持起見、不願加入、可是因為該會之組織和設施、未能盡滿人意、所以不願加入的、恐怕也不在少數、也許還有一部份僧尼、簡直至今尙不知道有中國佛敎會、更談不到加入、小部份與聞會務的僧衆、又絕少能够奉行佛氏「無我無議」的敎旨、什九都固持我執、並且因為思想和見解的不同、暗分新舊、各自擁護其領袖互爭領導權、因此智識程度較高的圓瑛和太虛二佾、使成為這般僧尼所擁護的對象、所以外界以為中國佛敎會的爭議、卽是圓瑛和太虛二僧的爭議、眞是阿彌陀佛、雖則全國僧尼的派別繁多、不過我想這兩大派的領袖、假使朵眞能够以身作則、化除成見、奉行佛氏「無我無諍」的敎旨、開誠合作、中國佛敎會的爭議、至少一定可以消除大半、爭議不消除、則團結不堅固、團結不堅固、會務自然無法推行、佛敎會的爭議、旣然大半關係在圓　瑛和太虛二佾、則過去佛敎會會務之所以不能順利推行、圓瑛和太虛二僧、當然不能辭共咎了、卽今後佛敎會是否能够「團結全國佾尼、整理敎規、宣傳敎義、發揚大乘救世精神、利濟生局、福益社會」、完成宏法利世的使命、一般佾尼固然應當共同努力、但是圓瑛和太虛僧、更應當精誠團結、為全國僧尼的表率、務使無我無諍的釋子集團、不再發生爭議、庶幾不愧為佛門弟予、佾界領袖、</p>
<p>本人奉命調整中國佛敎會、費了幾個月的調查和研究的工夫、才看出中國佛教會和中國一般住持佾尼的病源、佛敎會的病源、前叚已經說明、一般住持和佾尼的病源、在放案擔負宏法利世的本職、做住持的、把寺僧和敎產視同私產、專致力於護持敎產為其惟一的任務、其餘一般僧尼、又都把替施主做佛事當做職業、以為應赴佛事、就算盡了出家做和尙所應盡的責任、經義不明、戒律不守、無怪獅蟲日增、佾德日墮、敎法日衰了、</p>
<p>本人不忍中國佛敎會的有名無實、僧尼人格的日益墮落、所以才决定替佛敎會代擬了七十條約修正中國佛敎會章程草案、並附以說明、經部長的同意、先由本人以主管處處長的資格、把該項章程草案、交由該會現任理事長圓瑛僧、轉發全體理監事和各地佾尼切實研究、盡量發表意見、意思無非是在促起全國僧尼注意中國佛敎會、羣策羣力、從自覺自救自治、達到覺他利他度衆生的目的、該項章程草案、本來也未嘗不可呈經部長批准、逕用部令令飭中國佛敎會遵行、因為本人希望全國僧尼、明瞭中央調整中國佛敎會的意旨、免得被一二妄人所煽惑、同時使他們對於事關切身的該項章程草案、都有參加討論和貢獻意見的機會、並且藉此還可以測騐中國佛敎徒對於佛法是否有眞正的認識和信仰、所以才把章程草案、先交由圓瑛僧轉發各僧尼公開研究、這是本人普中國佛敎會草擬章程的動機和誠意、該項章提草案、常然未必盡善盡美、也許還有若干條文、應該修正或補充的、但是和該會現行章程比較起來、我敢說已經完備不少、數旬來、本人接到各地僧衆對於章程草案的意見、和在報上所見到的文字、大部份都表示贊同、不過最近從上海友人方面傳來消息、有少數僧衆和居士、對於該項章程草案中的四點、似乎尙有懷疑、特再分別說明於後、（未完）</p>
<h3>本年第二季　上海工商業異動報告　（續）　（上海工商業概况之三十五）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信可主編</p>
<p>B五月份重要工商行家之異動</p>
<p>甲，特種事業中</p>
<p>A金融業類</p>
<p>一，香港國民銀行上海分行復業該行送去年九月十六日該行香港總行電令停業後，迄今已閱八月。此次經債權人及股東議决，依照雙方協定計劃復業。港總行已於三月二日開業，上海分行於本月一日賡續營業，並改選馬惠弼君為經理，另招新股六十萬元，債權人存欵亦百元以上者以半數充作股份，半數定十期歸還。</p>
<p>二，意商義大利銀行擴充該行近為發展業務及與華商謀接近起見，特將資本總額增至意金二百萬里拉，並聘請金融專家康志蔭，吳國英為華經理，擬專營一切銀行業務及信用放欵。</p>

<p>B菜館業如：本月中有兩家歷史悠久之菜館宜吿淸理：其一為東武昌路四五九號品芳粵菜酒樓，該樓開業迄今，將近二十年，近因市面蕭條，營業不振，乃吿淸理招盤。其二為福建路九〇號鴻運菜館，開張以來，亦已數十年之久，而最近亦謂營業不振，週轉不靈，卒至無法維持，惟該館已於二十八日由褚汝霖君等接盤復業。</p>
<p>乙，製造工業中</p>
<p>一義源橡皮製造廠淸理，該廠最初時設於香港，自遷滬營業以來，亦已十有餘載，資本實額為十萬元，由楊明生君任經理，僱有工人一百五六十人，每日可產球鞋二千四百雙。初創時營業尙稱發達，近三年來因外貨傾銷，物價暴落，每年虧損達五六萬元，遷延至今，終因週轉不靈，宣吿無法維持。</p>
<p>二，中央三用電燈泡廠與奇特自由燈泡廠開慕該兩廠均係製造多絲燈泡為目的。前者由陳微宙君獨資創辦，資本為五萬元。後者由包益民，于味靑二君所創辦</p>
<p>丙，販賣商業中</p>
<p>一，興中公司上海分公司成立該公司為日本對華之經濟機關，與該國政府及三井，三菱等財閥有密切關係。總公司於去年十二月二十日在大速滿鐵會社開創立會，資本達日金一千萬元，分二十萬股，全數由滿鐵收受，社長為十河信治。分公司除上海外，擬於天津，廣東，東京，大阪等處設立同樣組織。上海分公司經理為宮崎益平；專營棉花，紗布，鋼鐵材料等物，以達所謂中日間之經濟提携。該公司之成立及今後之號展，實足重視。（未完）</p>

<h3>行乞興學的武訓</h3>
<p>— 韓德溥</p>
<p>「吃的好，不算好，修個義學才算好！我討飯，你別笑，修個義學你瞧礁！」</p>
<p>在淸朝道光年間，山東堂邑縣地方上出了一位了不起的人物。這人性情古怪得很，平素不愛吃不愛着，却偏偏喜歡創辦義學，專收窮苦人家的子弟到義學裏來唸書，——分文不受。像這樣的羲學，他共計辦了三處。照此說來，他一定是一位文縐縐的富翁了，但是事實上正恰恰相反，他非但半個大字不識，並且是一個要飯過活的窮呌化子，諸位或許有些懷疑？怎麼一個大字不識的窮呌化子，能够辦上幾處義學，豈不是奇事？不錯！正因為是一件寄事，所以值得在這兒叙述一下了。</p>
<p>這個了不起的人物姓武名訓，排行第七，家住堂邑縣武家莊，世代種田為業。傳到武訓，一連幾個荒年，收穫的一點穀子，管不上一家數口的口糧，家境漸漸衰敗下來。武訓這時已是成年的人，眼看這種情形難以支持下去，家裏除掉出門謀生的哥嫂而外，還有一個五六十歲的寡母，眞是人到矮簷下，誰敢不低頭，到了這種地步，祇有厚着面皮，提着破籃破碗打狗棒出門討飯了。</p>
<p>武訓雖然討飯過活，心地倒很忠厚，每天不間風雨的在外要飯，要着好一點的剩飯剩菜，就帶回來孝敬媽媽，剩下的自己才吃。地方上的人知道這事，都稱贊他是一個有孝心的呌化子。這樣過了兩年，武訓的媽媽發了老毛病死去了，剩下武訓一人，他便託人介紹一家唸書人家做傭工。</p>
<p>這人家雖說是書香門第，主人翁却是一個吝嗇不過的酸秀才。滿肚詩云，一口子曰，書本不離手，像煞有介事的，其實骨子裏却是一個大壞蛋，心裏無時無刻不在盤算人。武訓僱到他家裏，眞是合該倒運。</p>
<p>一天，武訓的姐姐托人帶了一封信兩串錢來，剛巧武訓下河挑水去了，來人心想；交給主人是再穩妥不過的了，便把信錢一齊拜託主人轉給武訓就去了。不料這位秀才看到這末兩串亮閃閃的大錢，不覺眼紅，心眼一歪，就預備全部沒收，反正武訓不識字，難到會看出不成？</p>
<p>武訓回來，秀才笑容可掬的說道：「武七，你姐姐有信問候你呢！我唸給你聽」。信唸過了，兩串大錢却一字不提。</p>
<p>正是事有凑巧，過了些時，武訓的親戚打此路過，順便看望武訓無意中談到姑奶奶托人帶錢的事，武訓道：「見鬼！那天信是主人交給我的，並沒有聽見提到錢啊！武訓的親戚道：「這準定是你主人吞吃了，快去找他！武訓聽罷，怒氣冲冲的飛奔回來。</p>
<p>武訓回來看見秀才，　得話都說不出，半嚮才吞吞吐吐的說道：「你你你把我姐姐送來的兩串大錢吞吃下去，那可不成！」秀才正打開一本論語看得出神，猛可被武訓平空說出這「吞吃」一句，頓時兩眼朝上一翻，桌子一拍：「混賬東西！誰看見你姐姐送來的錢！」說罷，兩個鼻孔張了一張，樣子像要吃人。武訓嚇得倒退兩步，怎奈自己一字不識，主人有綫有勢，奈何他不得，祇好啞子吃黃連苦在心，背地裏暗暗流淚。</p>
<p>日月如梭，已是過年的時節，秀才照例打點渡歲，便寫了一些斗方春聯，吩咐武訓糊貼，自己上街辦年貨去了。秀才去後，陡然起了一陣狂風，把春聯斗方吹做一團，武訓是不識字的，便糊裏糊塗的亂貼一回。等到秀才晚間回來，走進房中一看，不覺勃然大怒，將武訓喚來順手就是兩個耳光，駡道：「你是不是一個瞎囚？這是怎樣貼的！」原來武訓把「貓狗平安貼在秀才夫婦倆的床上，「闔家吉祥」貼在鷄窠上，大門後門的春聯，一邊貼了兩副上聯，一邊貼了兩副下聯，其餘貼倒貼錯的不一而足。貼錯春聯的頑意，在普通人家，是最忌諱的一件事，秀才一怒非同小可，當下算賬請武訓滾蛋。秀才把算盤一撥，說：「連工錢茶水費在內，打上一個八扣，算是抵銷今天的晦氣，下餘五百個銅錢是你的！」武訓心想：橫豎是要滾蛋了，這幾個臭銅錢，不要也窮不到那裏，頭朝前一昂，指着秀才駡道：「你吞吃了我的錢，還要把我的工錢打折扣，你還有良心嗎？這兩個臭錢我嫌骯髒，留給你塞狗洞吧！」嘩啦一聲，銅錢撒滿一地，武訓把包袱一夾，頭也不掉走出門去，從此他就開始過流浪生活了。</p>
<p>武訓離開秀才家以後，心想：過去吃了種種苦頭，受盡人家欺侮，全是因為自己愚笨，自己愚笨又因為沒有智識的緣故，不然，錢也不會被人家吞吃，工錢也不會被人家白賴了。同時他又想：世上像我這樣窮得沒有綫讀書的人，眞不知多少！我何不想個方法，辦個義學，敎敎他們識字，免得吃虧上當呢？但是自己是一個窮光蛋，那裏來錢辦學呢？他想了又想，用自己的氣力，替人家幹點活計，賺得的錢，積蓄起來，義學一定可以辦成功，主義打定，從此就天天　裏搓搓蔴綫，在破廟宇裏安身，白天出門要飯，討到一個錢就把他儲蓄起來。他又編了好多曲子，逢人便唱：「抗夥被人欺，不如討飯　自己；別看我討飯，早晚修個義學院。」人家看見他那一副不尷不尬的臉孔，瘋瘋癲癲的到處伸手要錢，大家都以為他是個瘋子，不去理睬他，但是他並不生氣？嘴裏還是唱着：「不給俺，俺不怨；自有善人管我飯。」</p>
<p>有時，上門討飯被人家駡了，他却唱：「大爺大叔別生氣，你老幾時不生氣了，我幾時出去」。「不强要，不强化，不用害怕！俺化緣，你行善，大家修個義學院」。</p>
<p>在前淸，百姓們的腦後，都有一根辮子，但是武訓沒有那些閑功夫化在這理辮子上，他把頭剃得光光，僅留着一塊桃形的頭髮，人家笑他，他就唱着下面一首歌給他們聽：「左邊剃，右邊留，興了義學不用愁。」</p>
<p>過了幾年，武訓手裏已積蓄有九十串錢了，再加上承分祖遺田產二畝，賣得一百二十串錢，兩下合起來共有二百一十串，他心想：辦一處義學，這兩個錢還差得遠呢！放在身邊，不大　當，不如存到婁進士那裏，婁老爺倒是一位至誠君子，將來本錢生利息，利息做本錢，本錢再生利息，如此下去，若干時後，不很可觀嗎？想着，信口唱道：「興義學，沒心煩，現在已有二百一十串」。「存本錢，生利息，求求館陶（地名）的婁進士。」</p>
<p>嘴裏唱着，不覺已走到婁進士門前，他雙膝跪在門檻上唱道：「不要米，不要麵，只求進士老爺見一見。」婁姓的家人見是一個瘋癲的化子，揮手呌他走開，武訓却跪在地上一動不動，任憑他們怎樣驅逐，死也不肯起身，嘴裏仍繼續唱着：「只求進士老爺見一見」！「只求進士老爺見一見！」</p>
<p>左右的人覺得他又可笑又可憐，隨便給點飯菜銅錢給他，他也不要直鬧到婁進士親自出來，他唱：「我討飯，你行善，修個義學你看看。」婁進士弄得莫名其妙，問他是什麼用意，他道：「我有大錢二百一十串，要存在府上生息，留為辦義學之用。」婁進士看他竟有這樣的好心腸，就答應了。隨即打發兩石家人跟他把二百一十串錢取來，代為保管生息。從此武訓每日討錢回來，都存到婁進士那裏。</p>
<p>有時人家給他好一點的飯菜，他自己捨不得吃，拿來賣給破落戶，自己喝洗鍋水。有人笑他，他就唱道：「吃的好，不算好，修個義學才算好。」「吃菜根，吃菜根我吃飯不求人；省下飯，修個義學院。」「吃芋尾，吃芋尾，不用火，不用水，省下錢，修個義學不費難。」拉圾堆里的菜根芋尾，都變成他的食糧。</p>
<p>他的肚皮眞奇怪，討不着飯菜，　不着菜根芋尾，什麼蛇蝎破磚碎瓦都可充飢，在他一方面却是生財大道，祗要你給錢，他儒可常面吃給你看，唱歌給你解悶：「吃蝎子，食蝎子，修個義學我的事。」「蛇可吃，不要怕！修個義學全在我　家。」「破磚碎瓦，都能消化；若不修義學，才惹人笑話。」</p>
<p>他還有一種本領——豎蜻蜓，兩脚朝天，半個時辰能不倒下來，玩這頑意的時候，既不用　，也不用鼓，他有他的老調頭：「豎一個，一個錢，豎十個，十個錢；豎得多，錢也多，誰說不能修義學院？」只要錢給得多，他可以豎起來爬着走，一壁爬一壁唱：「爬一遭，一吊錢，爬十遭，十吊錢；修個義學不費難。」</p>
<p>俗話說：「世上無難事，祇怕用心人，武訓正是這麼一個人。日積月累，竟給他積有七八千吊錢，看看數目可以了，便走去和婁進士商議，結果，買進二百多畝田地，租給人家耕種，作為將來義學的常年經費。第二年，碰巧有位郭善人願捐出良畑二畝，作為義學基地。於是由婁進士出面，用武訓的錢建築了二十多間瓦屋，取名「崇賢義塾」，招有貧寒子弟幾十名。他為了請崔舉人做敎師，苦苦地跪求了幾天，終於打動崔舉人的心，答應下來，道樣，武訓的志願總算達到了。</p>
<p>武訓自己雖不識字，他對於學生們讀書，却很認眞。一天，討錢經過義塾，順便看看裏面情形如何，不料不看猶可，看頓時氣得呆如木鷄，你道為何？原來那些小學省們，趁着敎師睡午覺，都悄悄溜到樹蔭下逍遙自在去了，有的翻觔斗，有的揪住小辮子打做一團。武訓在門縫裏瞧了好久，不見有人勸止，忍不住唱道：「讀書不用功，回家無臉見父兄：讀書不用心，回家無臉見母親！」學生們聽見是武訓的聲音，一溜烟都奔向座位去了。</p>
<p>武訓走進課堂，却不見敎師在內，再向臥房一看，崔老師止在鼾聲如雷的睡着，他一聲不響的雙膝脆倒地上。</p>
<p>一會兒，崔老師醒來，猛然看見武訓直挺挺的跪着，非常慚愧，趕忙把武訓攙起說道：「武先生，何必如此？我實在過意不去，以後如有不對的地方，請直言相吿好了。」武訓却毫不在意的唱道：「先生睡覺，學生胡鬧，我來跪求，一了百了。」崔舉人滿臉飛紅，道歉說：「自後定當勤謹從專。」學生不用功的，他也照樣跪在他們面前懇求，這末一來，就是再懶惰的敎師再貪頑的學生，再也不敢丟開書本去嬉戲了。</p>
<p>武訓自己除辦義學而外，一錢如命，不敢妄用分文，但是對於學好的窮人，却很肯帮助。他聽見人們傳說本地有一個張姓媳婦，侍奉婆婆十分孝順，一次為希望婆婆病好，竟暗自割股煎湯給她喝。武訓知道這事以後，隨即送給她十畝良田，並且對人唱道：「這人好，這人好，我給十畝還嫌少；這人孝，這人孝，給她十畝好養老。」相反，他對於好吃懶做的哥哥，却一點不肯通融，他說：「我的事，你別管，兄弟分居不相干！」他絕不因同胞弟兄，改變他的主張。</p>
<p>一天，他走到一座大廟門前，裏面的殿宇十　雄偉，他心想：放着一座偌大的好地方不辦義學，却供着這些鬼怪的泥像，豈不傻氣？隨手在門上扣了兩下：「廟宇大，和尚多，為伺不將義學修？」惹得一衆和尚，都大笑起來。大槪笑得太厲害了，驚動裏面的當家和尙，走出查問根由。武訓唱道：「我討飯，你別笑，修個義學你瞧瞧。」當家和尙問道：</p>
<p>「你老莫非義學症武先生嗎？久仰！久仰！」武訓速稱「不敢！不敢！」便隨着和尙到客堂中來。</p>
<p>這位當家和尙素聞武訓其人，今白相遇，那肯錯過，便敎武訓以後移居到佛廟中，進出歇宿，也很方便，武訓一口應允，在廟中住了年餘，那位當家和尙把自己積蓄的兩千多串錢，也統統捐給武訓興辦義學，眞是至誠所至，無往不利了。</p>
<p>他唱歌的效力很大，常有許多人為他所感動，有的給錢，有的給飯菜，他把錢用繩子穿起來，飯菜賣給人家，賣的錢也串起米，點淸數目，就送到婁進士家裏去，然後回來到破廟裏和泥菩薩做伙伴。他能隨機應變討人家歡喜，有一次，他從破廟裏出來，剛巧走到廟門口，那屋角的破瓦打下打在他的頭上，鮮血直流，他滿不在乎，捏把香灰掩住傷口，他又唱起來了：「打破頭，出出火，修個義學全在我。」把聽的人幾乎腰都要笑着。天才發白，他又離開破廟出外討飯去了。</p>
<p>他弄錢的門徑眞多，一有閒空，就帮人家做小工，不管掃糞鋤草推磨都來。別人做工有一定時間，他却一直做到天黑才丟手，他常常這樣唱：「除糞鋤草拉　子來找，管黑不管了，不論錢多少。」「推磨，推磨，一斗麥子六十合，管磨不管籮，管籮錢還多。」他平常抱的是笑駡由人主義，祇要你給錢，吐沫吐在臉上也情願：「義學症，沒火性，見了人，把禮敬；上了錢，活了命，修個義學萬年不能動。」</p>
<p>武訓討飯興學的客聲，一天一天的傳揚開來，全山東省的人，幾乎無一不知，後來，連巡撫大人也曉得了，忙着人傳見，果然名不虛傳，瘋瘋癲癲的：「我不瘋，我不病，一心只害義學症。」唱不住口。再參觀所辦義塾，成績都不壞，便備文奏請朝廷嘉獎。</p>
<p>這天，武訓在外要飯，忽見一頂官轎遠遠拾來，心想轎中必之坐的大官貴人。機會不可錯過，破　子打狗棒向下一放，雙膝跪倒地上。放開喉嚨來。</p>
<p>轎夫看見前面有人跪着，以偽是吿狀的，喝道：「跪在地下的聽着，裕侍郎大人在此，伸冤打官司，可從實說來！」武訓唱道：「不打官司不吿狀，興義學我在行，大老爺捐錢帮帮忙！」裕侍郎心想：此人古怪異常，莫非是義學症武訓不成？便問道：「你是武七嗎？」武訓道：「小人正是。」裕侍郎道：「好！義學捐欵，容即奉上。」武訓爬在地上磕了一個頭，高興地走開了。</p>
<p>過了些時，忽接朝廷有旨意下來，封武訓為「義學正」，欽賜黃馬褂，並頒「樂善好施」扁額一方，張掛義塾，好不光榮！但是武訓却一點不覺得希奇，他隨口唱道：「義學症，不用封！黃馬褂，沒得用！辦個義學萬年不能動。」他仍舊過着他的討飯生活。</p>
<p>有人勸他討個老婆，將來也好傳宗接後，他老是搖搖頭：「不娶妻，不生子，修個義學才無私。」直到臨死，他仍舊是一個單身漢。他常以這首歌來表白他的志趣：「人生七十古來稀，五十三歲不娶妻，親戚朋友死個凈，臨死落個義學症。」他對於生死的問題，看得也很平淡，他唱：「路死路埋，街死街埋，死了自有棺材」</p>
<p>他是光緒二十二年逝世的，——活了五十九歲，他的全部遺產便是這手創的三處義塾，此外一無所有。出殯的那天，送葬的有一萬多人，內中有好多是義效裏造就出來的學生，個個都是痛哭流涕，惋惜贊歎！他的骸骨便葬在義塾的旁邊。直到現在，那些破籃破碗！——遺物，和手創的義學，還好好的保存在山東臨淸縣呢！</p>
<h3>畢士麥Otto　Bismarck</h3>
<p>— 雲波</p>
<p>畢士麥是創造德國的英雄。雖然有人說他主張專制，提倡武力，是一個混世魔王；但是他的毅力和籌劃，是值得我們佩服的；他的功績和志願，是值得我們敬仰的。</p>
<p>從前德國還沒有統一的時候，有許多德意志民族的小國，組織一個聯邦政府。這聯邦政府是受奧國支配的，奧國却不是和他們同族。</p>
<p>在這許多聯邦中，有一個較大的王國，呌普魯士。畢士麥便是普魯士人。他出身貴族，少時很放縱，不守禮法，喜歡飲酒，常和人决鬥；有時練習打靶，轟轟的槍聲，一天到晚不停；他的四隣都厭惡他，呌他「暴亂公子」。但是在他父親死後，他便日夜悲傷，一些不露出狂蕩的形態。這便見得他有着熱烈的情感，和眞誠的人格；是一個實於血性的英雄。</p>
<p>他在學校裏讀書的時候，很喜歡研究歷史地理。他讀歷史議到法國從前蹂躪普國的情形，便想報仇雪恨。他看到歷史上，凡是種族混雜的國家，不久終要分裂，他便想排斥奧國，讓普國來領導這同種族的德意志聯邦。他看到地理上，凡是對建制度的國家，不久終要解散，他便想統一各聯邦，成功一個團結堅强的國家。這幾個觀點，是他一生努力的目標。</p>
<p>他對於國際形勢很注意，當他旅行英法二國的時候，時常留心考察各國的政治，並且研究得很精博，便是法皇的性情，他也很細心的探訪。他看到奧國政治的腐敗，大臣的庸弱，便自信他的志願，决定能够成功的。他做駐俄公使的時候，他覺得歐洲各國的形勢，只有俄國可以做助手，他的外交政策，便事事連絡俄國。他對於一生的事業，都曾有很精密的準備。</p>
<p>那是普皇威廉一世正想統一聯邦，使普國做聯邦的領袖。預備改革軍制，擴張軍備，積極增强兵力。但是國會不贊成這種舉動，拼命反對，普皇覺得沒有辦法，便用畢士麥做宰相來和國會對抗。</p>
<p>畢士麥因為是貴族的後裔，所以有着傲慢的性格，養成了專制和尊王的思想。他以為在普國那時侯，只有獨斷獨行，才能自由行使他的手段，來達到統一聯邦的目的，國會和憲法，都足以阻碍他勇往直前的政策。他做了宰相後，便把平日反對改革軍制的文武官吏，一律免職；並且决定解散國會。凡是政府所要做的事情，像擴張軍備，改革軍制，增加軍費等，都立即實行。他對民衆的代表說：「目前各種問題，只有用鐵和血才能解决。」從此以後，大家便呌他「鐵血宰相。」</p>
<p>這時全國的民衆，因為他排斥民權，解教國會，禁止言論出版等的自由，所以都很痛恨他，當他敵人看待。但是畢士麥有着遠大的目光，堅定的志向，並不顧民衆的反對，只是竭力實行他的計劃。他相信在那散漫的局面裏，非强幹不為功；他又相信自己的作為，是有利於德意志民族，並非自利的舉動。將來成功，民衆總會諒解他的。因此他抱着為國犧牲的精神，竭力盡忠去做統一聯邦的偉業。</p>
<p>雖然有些人想暗殺他，但是他仍舊不怕。他說：「要使民衆滿意，只要把我絞死。可是我還想使德國統一，使德國富强，現在還不能死呢。冉過了幾年，等到我的政策成功以後，民衆一定還要歡迎我咧！」</p>
<p>他第一次實行「鐵血政業」，是同丹麥開戰。他故意和奧國約為同盟，這樣便可以使奧國不和別國聯合，還可以藉此試騐奧國的兵力。他的用意多麼深遠啊！</p>
<p>當普國打勝丹麥，和奧國訂條約的時候，故意和奧國爭權利，激動奧國的忿怒。結果便同奧國開戰，很容易的將奧國打敗。排斥奧國的目的，便見達到了。</p>
<p>普國接連打了兩次勝仗，國勢便漸漸强盛。因此使法皇非常妒忌，終於又和法國開戰。在戰事中，他用迅速的手段，攻破法國京城巴黎。威廉世便在巴黎加冕，做德國聯邦的皇帝。各聯邦都怕普國的威勢，表示都願意服從普皇的指揮。畢士麥幾！年來蓄着的統一　志，終久成功了。</p>
<p>畢士麥雖然主張鐵血政策，但是在德國統一以後，他的政策便改變了。他以前曾主張獨裁，現在却順世界的潮流，提倡國家社會主義；尊自由，重民權，立憲法，開議會，修正新刑法，提倡自由貿易，努力改進工業。他努力做建設事業，使國家的基礎鞏固。德國受到他的指導，便漸趨繁盛，成為歐洲的一個强國。</p>
<p>畢氏容貌魁偉，精神煥發，體格强健，作事勤勞，很肯負責，並且意志堅固，敢作敢為，不怕艱難和一切阻碍，他的毅力是很可欽佩的。他雖然如此果决，但是事前却籌劃得極精細。他遇到一件事情，必先詳細審察他的外表，還要精密考察他的結果。若有危險，便要仔細測量危險性的大小，並且計算怎樣才可以防止那危險。他决不肯做不妥當的事，他所實行的政策，也從沒有失敗過。</p>
<p>他並不喜歡戰爭，因為戰爭終是危險的。他在德國統一以後，永遠沒有用「鐵血政策」。凡兩國的友誼，可以勉强維持，不必用兵的時候，他决不肯輕易和人動兵。他所打的幾次仗，都是不能不打的，並且還經過幾十年冷靜的考慮，方才决定。他嘗說；「上帝所弄的牌，我們不能看見的。」雖然他很有得勝的把握，也還常常恐防失敗。我們若說他粗豪放誕，好大喜功，那便看錯他的人格了。</p>
<p>後來畢士麥因為和新主威廉一世意見不合，他便辭職退隱。那時他已七十五歲了。當他獨坐一輛馬車，將要走出德京柏林的時候，道旁的許多民衆，都獻花環送他。頌揚祝福的聲音，像雷聲般響着。畢士麥當時便下車，和他們吿別。民衆都圍住他歡呼萬歲。畢士麥感激得流着淚，民衆也很悲傷地涕泣送行。畢士麥以前所說的話，果然應騐了。現在民衆多麼親愛他啊！</p>

<h3>簡愛自傳（三）</h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>英C.白朗底女士作　李霽野譯　生活書店世界文庫出版</p>
<p>簡愛的才藝是多方面的，（她善繪畫，尤其健談，使得主人暗中愛了他。）個性是極其崛强有堅决的自主之見的。羅契司特爾的年紀超過了簡愛一倍，並且是不很漂亮的男子，（雖然簡愛自己也不算美。）兩人的階級又離開得很遠，彼此本沒有戀愛的可能。可是在長時間彼此傾吐肺腑之後，使簡愛一顆小小純潔的心裏暗暗鐫上了健壯而寄特的男性羅契司特爾的小影了。</p>
<p>有一天夜裏，簡愛還沒有入睡的當兒，她聽見足步聲，私起追踪，發現有人放火要燒死羅契司特爾，她又很秘密的救了他。羅契司特爾叮囑她不要聲張，第二天他就出走了，不久之後，他接來許多貴客，（其中有不少貴婦和美麗的小姐們。）在桑恩費爾得盤旋了很久的時間，於是一度哄傳羅契司特爾就要和貴族殷格來姆小姐結婚了。</p>
<p>殷格來姆小姐住在桑恩費爾特府很久，他們頑了不少貴族常頑的消遺法，例如唱歌打獵跳舞鬥葉子等等，這些當然沒有簡愛在內，因為簡愛只是一個低賤的保姆罷了。殷格來姆小姐對於簡愛和阿狄拉常表示一種鄙視的態度，只是一天天和羅契司特爾更觀暱起來。</p>
<p>羅契司特爾眞怪，他忽然化裝一個老女巫，替所有貴族乃至於住在他府上的人們算起命來，誰也不知道他就是羅契司特爾，因為在幾日前已宣布他出門籌辦婚禮的事件去了。最後，他替簡愛算命，才現出他的原形。</p>
<p>後來他們二人又秘密地做了一件救他的朋友馬遜被瘋人咬刺的事情，他們二人精神上更契合了。</p>
<p>殷格來姆小姐願意嫁羅契司特爾的目的，只是要圖得他的財產的一半，後來有一種謠言說他並沒多少財產，並且負債，於是婚約便破了。羅契司特爾向簡愛曾經這樣說：</p>
<p>「我假裝出對殷格來姆小姐求愛，因為我願使你如同我對你一樣來瘋狂地愛我；而且我知道，促進這種目的，嫉妬是我所能請求的最好聯盟者。」——頁二四一</p>
<p>婚禮很順利地進行了，當羅契司特爾和簡愛宣布結婚以後，一般人都非常驚訝起來，認為這種結合是極不適宜的。果然，好事多磨，在大禮拜堂中請牧師誓婚的時候，忽然從觀禮的來賓中，出現了幾個破壞婚禮的人一個是布幾里律師，是簡愛的叔父愛先生請求他出來阻止這虛假的婚姻的；一個是馬遜，他曾在桑恩費爾得被瘋人咬刺過的。他門阻止的理由，是羅契司特雨已經結過婚，新娘便是馬遜的妹妹。並且證明羅契司特爾夫人尙在人世，而且還在桑恩費爾得府邸中。</p>

<p>近年來吾醫界忽發現一驚人消息，即淋病治療上，已闢一新境地，蓋淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，業經創製成功，據Weichardt敎授及Virchow博士之報吿，淋病之白血球增加療法，為抗除全身淋菌，使其永遠根治之捷徑，「克淋儂」之增加白血球，效力既宏，且無任何流弊，不碍腸胃，故為各國學者所賞用，Heilfieber博士及「克淋儂」發明人彼得氏，均有關於治淋之各種最為統計。余自留俄用此藥後，計所治男子急性尿道淋及慢性攝護腺，睪丸炎之病者，有百分之九十五人以上皆臻全治。愈後雖飲酒劇勞，亦不復發。婦女淋病之白帶子宮炎，除服「克淋儂」外，並外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥，雙方兼治，故治愈尤速，約百人中即有九十八名治愈。其藥量約子五瓶至九·十瓶左右，即奏全功！</p>
<h3>婦女失眠與月經</h3>
<p>— 南通醫大畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>月經病能刺戟神經而使失眠　失睡亦能使月經困難</p>
<p>諺云「寗醫十男子，勿醫一女人」，蓋女子多諱疾忌醫。如女子神經衰弱，往往不能入寐。卵巢機能失常，故使月經不調，於是百病緣之而起。且婦女月經不調，即難有生殖之望。凡患失眠月經困難之婦女，其身體必多纖弱，四肢乏力，皺紋覆額，兩顴突出，面龐消瘦，憔悴不堪，腰痛白帶下，縱日服調經安眠劑，仍難奏功。蓋此病必具有鎭攝神經，推動卵泡刺戟素，使月經調整，始可稱為根治療法。</p>
<p>「補女容」對於上述諸症，有特殊效騐。蓋此片係雌性荷爾蒙製成。以抗增各部欠缺之內分泌而補足之。因此對於經亂失眠各症，均無不在短期中澈底根治。且愈後精神活潑，面色細膩動人，有住蒲石路梁志芸夫人，亦久苦經亂失眠，服「補女容」後，僅五星期，月經即調整，恢復固有健康。經調而受孕自易矣。故「補女容」一藥，久已蜚聲寰球，苟非功效卓特，安能臻此</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>診所　四川路寗波路轉角　診時　上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>處置最易復發之淋病</p>
<p>淋病如不根治，則屢發之事在所難免，每發一次，則淋毒深進一次，而其最易再發者。厥為副尿道炎，原來我人之副尿道，位於外尿道口附近之處，其孔極小，約當針孔大小但副尿道管却深而且長，此種生理情形，適合狡猾之淋菌潛伏生存；大抵淋毒之副尿道炎之釀成。多由於患者在尿道淋時，荏苒失治。或被手術未精到之醫生，於行尿道洗滌時，淋菌乘機竄入，遂潛伏繁茲，待機為患。凡遇飲酒，房事，劇動，疲勞之餘，即起而活動，但稍事療養後，彼仍潛伏，如此往復相乘，馴至尿道腫痛，膿水積儲化而為膿瘍。因而傷害小便的排泄，及房事後之射精。是副尿道炎一症。實足使畢生蒙其痛苦，且有斷絕嗣育之虞。</p>
<p>故為免除不易肅淸及易發之淋病起見，對於副尿道炎實有根治必要。有住八仙橋周訓齊君，染淋病時發時愈。尿道腫脹，防尿射精不利，經余用電氣及X線治療後，更投以『克淋儂』已抗淋殺菌，使潛伏深部淋菌，皆一掃而除。前後計服五星期，覆診三次。始達全部肅淸之效。經用血淸檢查六七次，迄無一次有淋菌發現。遂證明根治。其夫人淋毒白帶，亦內服『克淋儂』，外用『卡而雪地氏陰道片』為坐葉，以除白帶，亦於三星期而愈。偕居迄今，已二子矣。</p>
<h3>肺病百問</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時</p>
<p>2·安靜療法何以對癆病有良效？</p>
<p>安靜療法，為治愈肺癆必取之手段。安靜之範圍殊廣，主要者，為精神安靜，肉體安靜。而肉體安靜不過使肺臟靜止，故肺臟之安靜，實為重要。今世盛行之人工氣胸術，胸廓形成術，橫膈膜神經切除，目的均在使患肺停止其呼吸運動，以促進治愈之機轉。蓋肺為癆菌侵蝕後，即炎潰腐壞，其病灶雖有大小之不同，而必須使其癒合始克就痊。故無論初期及重篤期之肺癆，以肺之安靜為第一要義。胸廓形成術等外科療治，均有一定之適應症，非普通人所宜。故肺病專家醫師，莫不着重藥物治療，</p>
<p>查通常療肺製劑，皆不外增進營養、止血止欬、固僅能治，標不能治本。惟最新發明之『補肺拿爾』一藥，不特有壯補全身之力，且能使患肺之呼吸機能减退，而得到休息。並能縮小患肺之血行及淋巴行，以减去菌毒之流佈週身。一方又防碍癆蔥繁殖。故肺癆之欬嗽多痰，喀血胸痛，潮熱瘦憊，盜汗虛弱，服之一二月左右，即可完全根木治愈。對於肺癆之神經衰弱，失眠心悸，男子陰萎早洩，腰痛腎虧。婦女月經不調，經來服痛等，可於服『補肺拿爾』外，同時兼服男用『補體康』以補腎補體，或兼服女用『補女容』以調經補腦。如男子有遺精可再服『耐而斯遺精片』；婦女兼有自帶可並外用『卡而雪地』為坐藥，如此顧慮週到，未有不指日可愈者！</p>
<p>遺精談片</p>
<h3>精液損失之原因之二</h3>
<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>手淫自凟之結果：　先天不足之成因：</p>
<p>診所：寗波路通和銀行對過</p>
<p>精液損失，蓋指遺精症而言。遺精有淺深之別，輕者為夢精（有夢而遺），進而為無夢遺精，甚者白晝精滑，或精液漏（用力或排尿通便時滑洩者），此症之原因有二，或未靑年發育期，妄行手淫，斵傷性神經中樞而起。或由先天不足，荷爾夢缺乏，輸精管失其控制能力之故。治療之法，必須歛攝精管，鎭靜射精中樞神經，旺盛荷爾蒙機能，故以服「耐兒斯遺精片」以鎭靜中樞神經及斂攝精管為最妥切。而以同時兼服「補體康」旺盛荷爾蒙機能更佳。</p>
<p>對於手淫而來之遺精，則必須戒除手淫。舊來固精之藥，均無戒之手淫之功，惟「耐而斯遺精片」能鎭攝腦經。强頂意志，故服後手淫自戒，而遺精精漏精滑等症，亦皆並療，凡遺精症之腦弱頭暈，健忘失眠，可並服「補體康」以挽衰弱若因肺病而遺精，可並服「補肺拿爾」以減癆補肺，標本兼施，收效果偉。</p>
<h3>秋凉後流行之胃腸炎</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>慢性消化不良患者更宜注意！</p>
<p>秋日之流行病，以胃腸炎居首。蓋睡眠偶一招凉，食物誤進腐敗，往往引起消化障碍，胃腸之內容物發酵而起炎症於是發生洩寫腹痛，嘔吐酸水，頭重，頭痛，發熱，食思缺乏等，據余臨床上實騐，以服消化障碍專藥」」强胃精為最效。此藥能淸滌胃內之腐敗物，消滅腸部之　酵，而减除其充血症狀，則在短時日內，即可全部樞廖，而免痢疾等其他險症矣。</p>
<p>胃腸炎轉為慢性時，則有胃呆胃滯，食慾不振，胸膈滿悶，嘈雜，嘔吐噯氣，泛酸，心胃氣氣痛等，以及消化不良，大便秘結或腸蠕動疾速之下痢水瀉，腸壁吸收緩滯之大便溏蕩」「强胃精」以其內含酵　及脾素，有糾正胃腸障礙之偉力，故服之三四瓶或七八瓶左右，雖年久痼疾。亦獲霍然並治，本藥對於小兒吐乳綠便等，亦極相宜。並善療缺乏維他命B之脚氣症，因「强胃精」兼含大量維他命B也。其性格王道純良，實非其他製劑所能及。</p>
<h3>標準之內分泌製劑</h3>
<p>— 日本帝大醫科陳堃和醫師</p>
<p>以恢復性組織機能為條件</p>
<p>內分泌療法，自從倍多德Berthold氏，勃隆司括Brewn　Sepuard氏發明與奠定基礎之後，對於此種療法，遂有長足進步。然語其圓滿之成功尙遠也。蓋從前不知對於性德組織，加以徹底改造。故成功者半，失敗者半，及德人梅倫氏出，始獲最後成功，梅氏在研究此等療法之初，曾歷選各靑春期之勇壯動物，取其最適當者，摘其靑春腺，加以長時間之研究，改良，始成功今日盛行之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」二藥，先將衰老期之動物試騐，結果圓滿；更推而試用性組織被手淫，及早婚色慾過度所摧殘之患者，亦於短期內，用顯微鏡觀察性系組織，均恢復全健。於是男子之遺精，早洩，迅歸治愈。而性部發育不全，矮小等症，亦均有正常發育，蓋性組織不健全，則各部發育不能達正常發育，同時遺精早洩，勃起力不堅等症，必難達到根治之目的。此實內分泌療法上之新發見。而「補體康」「補女容」二藥，亦標準之內分泌製劑也。余在東京時，已熟知此藥功效之宏偉，比歸國以來，在臨床實騐上，治愈男性之下部矮小，遺精神經衰弱，女子之月經不調，乳房臀部平削如男子者，服後皆可在短期中治愈。為數已近三數千矣。此外久服，不僅有補給內分泌及矯正性組織功能，亦有却病駐顏之效也。</p>

<h3>白帶能使不孕</h3>
<p>— 武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>小兒失明——咎在母親。</p>
<p>婦女之病，十九皆與白帶有關，蓋此病因婦女羞恥觀念甚重，故多棄置而不醫治，抑不知凡我人濕潤之處，即細菌附緣繁殖之地。往往見婦女子宮無故出血者，此無地他，皆因細菌為崇耳。尤其是丈夫素有淋病，因而釀成淋毒性子宮炎，卵巢炎，巴妥淋氏腺炎，其分泌物即白帶也，此種白帶有劇毒，凡分娩時初生兒在產道中經過，若誤將此物沾入眼內，則小兒在數小時內，即有失明之危險。</p>
<p>故婦女白帶一病，在表面上看去，固十分輕微，然一語其危險，則又令人不寒二憟。現在治帶至最有特效之坐藥，首推「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，此片有殺菌止泌防腐之功，而無不良副作用。每次於臨睡前，取一片插入　道為坐藥。次晨法去即得。惟因淋病而來者，尙須內服「克淋儂」，以肅淸深部淋菌。又因白帶而月經困難，生育停止者，除用此片外，宜兼服「補女容」，則奏效更速，余恒以此方法介紹有白帶病之婦女，囑其在家自療，每獲意外功效。其治愈者，不下數千人矣。</p>
<h3>急性淋之尿道腫大</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>幾致小便不能而成尿中毒</p>
<p>患者朱受南君，住愛多亞路某里，今春因應朋輩春宴，座有名花侑酒，比及酒闌燈炧。朱君托詞反家，其實即入其香巢也。因而遂染淋病，尿道粘膜發炎腫大，四圍幾為之密合無間（如A圖）因而小便異常困難，頻有膿液之物流出，痛楚不堪，晝夜呼號，不能安枕，且因不得小便而致成尿中毒現象。雖曾購服透膜殺菌等淋藥，而功效不見，嗣由友人介紹余處恰療，除先為之消毒滌淸膿液之物後，隨即投以德國「克淋儂」以殺菌淸炎，鎭痛退腫，並使其全身起抗淋作用，俾淋菌不致分竄各部。以免變症。連服二星期後，朱君之腫痛，已去十之七八，病機已大為好轉。乃繼服至十數天，尿道粘膜腫痛，已全部獲愈，恢復原來健全狀態。（如Ｂ圖）已將此痛苦不堪之急性淋全部治愈矣。此為克淋儂治愈急性淋之症。但凡遠年白濁，及白濁之各種變症，均有特殊良效。以此藥為黃色素與蛋白體混合製成，其功效超過任何淋藥也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>粵省實行禁賭禁烟</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>粵省最大的稗政是烟賭，人民最受切膚之痛，亦是烟賭，陳濟棠臨去時，總計其私人財產，港幣幾千萬元，財物幾千萬元，現金幾千萬元，地產價値亦不下幾千萬元，陳濟棠數年來在粵羅掘的總數量，幾至不可勝計，此種財物，雖未必盡屬烟賭中所得，而在烟賭中所得的，必定有大部分。</p>
<p>粵人何辜，受此荼毒，旣傾家而蕩產，亦骨瘦而如豺，雖日烟賭之害，人人皆知，粵人自己不知愛好，自去投入羅網，咎由自取，尙復何言，不知好貨之心，人所同具，而舒適之境，人所同甘，政府旣以此誘人，人焉能自扳，而地方上一點一滴的膏血，便盡入於陳氏囊中矣。</p>
<p>自嗜烟賭而百事俱廢，一榻橫陳，俾畫作夜，呼吆喝六，倒篋傾筐，旣而悔之，亦云已晚，故烟賭之害，小之足以破家喪身，大之足以亡國滅種，蓋現之我國，是處何等地位之國家，現在各國，是處何等地位之國家，如德意諸國，講求優生，殘弱病廢之人，非但不令結婚，幷且還要去勢，何也，殘弱病廢在國民，在現在弱肉强食的世界中，原無存在之餘地也。</p>
<p>今我國一般優秀有為之國民，一染嗜好，等於廢人，一浸賭博，則諸事莫理，此種人民，對於國家，有何補益，對於民族，日益墮落，以如此民族之國家，而欲與列强抵抗，亦祇有淘汰與受人踐踏而已，故我中央政府，自統一粵省以後，首先禁止吸烟，禁止賭博，以除粵人之大害，而為强國之要圖，宜粵人之額手涕零，稱慶不止者也。</p>
<p>近據港訊，粵九月一日，實行禁賭，全省正雜賭館，三十一晚結束，失業者逾十萬人，烟二十九年禁絕，毒二十五年禁絕，粵省烟賭之風，所以如此之盛者，無非在上倡之，而在下翕然從之，若再數年，則粵人之財產不盡為陳氏一人之財產者幾希，故粵人之有陳氏，是粵人之不幸，陳氏之不能久安其位，今茲被迫而去，亦屬粵人之大幸矣。</p>
<p>禁賭實行，而失業者達十萬之衆，似不能不為若輩慮，惟若輩專恃賭博為生涯者，原是一般游手好閑，及土匪流氓，素無職業之斐，本因失業而靠賭博，决非因賭博而失業也，若輩賭徒，本是流民習藝所中人物，其結果亦只有驅之習藝所中而已，烏足慮。</p>

<h3>在古城頭</h3>
<p>— 夏嬰</p>
<p>對着這古城底慕景他讚嘆起來了。「這可愛的，靜靜的南國底城市啊！」他這麼喃喃着。我瞧着他底表情；這一次，我還發現了他那詩人似的情感。不是很奇怪的事嗎？這麼一個溫文有禮的少年人出生入死地在砲火裏打仗！忍不住問了他為什麼要當兵；和戰塲上的戚想。聽了我底發問以後他笑了，伸出手來拍了一下我底肩膀，說道：</p>
<p>「你底問話呌我怎麼同答才是呢？你現在是太年輕了，你不會懂得的。祗是，我可以吿訴你我當兵原是為了生活！一個人為了要喫飯，總得找一個飯碗；我去打仗不也是這個道理嗎？雖然，等到國家眞的用得着我，要去和外來的强力抵抗的時侯，那我是在盡一份國民底天職！在戰塲上，我是感到，要是有一天我們千千萬萬的弟兄們底槍口朝外放的時候，那我就是粉骨碎身，也是所願的！而現在，我每一次上戰塲，內心都有說不出的痛苦……」</p>
<p>「是的，方連長，若是槍口朝外放，我也情願和你一塊兒去打仗哩。」我興奮地說了。</p>
<p>「眞的麼？那好極啦！」他也興奮地說，又拍着我底背。「你現在還小，好好地努力吧，將來總有給你參加抵抗外來的强力的機會的……你聽，那麻臉的號兵又吹起集合號來了，我們回去吧。」</p>
<p>一陣啼啼打打的喇叭吹着，我們也就起了身，走下城脚去。</p>
<p>方連長沒有多久就給調了防，我們底別離並沒有一些傷威和眷戀，祗是對於這有一種說不出的悒鬱的，蒼老的古城，他流露出無限的惜別的戚情。秋天已經很深，風也很冷，我祗是反覆地向他道着珍重……</p>
<p>這是我在那古城底第七個秋天—一最後的秋天的印象。在一個吹着凛冽的北風，漫天呈着灰暗的寒凍之日，我辭別了家園，奔上了我遠行的旅程。一年，兩年，三年，……古城頭底記憶在生活底激流中一天一天地冲淡了起來，如今是臨到又一個秋天的來到，眞敎人興起無限的感慨啊。</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 芳踪</p>
<p>晚上，天剛黑，路上的行人分外稀少，只有腰間掛着刺刀的××兵，三三兩兩邊跑邊笑，有的喝醉了酒，有的攔路調戲女人。在冷僻的街巷裏，只有淸脆的脚聲在沉重地響，那沉重的聲音一次復一次打在人們的心上。「支那」人不大看見，尤其是婦女。</p>
<p>我坐在家裏，同一位老隣居閑談。在昏黃的油燈前，他——這個年紀已經不小的生意人——興奮地，然而又很膽怯地川力壓低了自己的聲音，對我說話。</p>
<p>「你為什麼還要回到這裏來？」口氣裏帶着很抱怨的意味。</p>
<p>「我怎麼可以不回來呢？這兒是我的家，我要看看我家裏的一切！」</p>
<p>「啊，家，你遝有家嗎？你的家還能住在這裏嗎？我勸你，你應該趕快把你的全家，搬進關內去，北平，天津—哦，不，那些地方聽說也不好，還是搬到南方去，上海，廣東！」他抽了一口烟，『可憐我沒有綫，店又關了，我只要路費凑得起，我一定搬，搬到關內……」</p>
<p>「不要悲傷吧，慢慢地，我們總要守着我們的家，把××們趕出去！」我安慰他，同時又這樣地鼓勵他和自己。</p>
<p>慢慢地！慢到什麼時候，守到什麼時候？你遝不知道嗎，我們中國人在這裏，已經不好過日子了，他們把什麼生</p>

<h3>Rumors of Tax Cuts in Hebei and Chahar</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The foreign wire reported the other day that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, with regard to goods imported from the Jidong puppet area, intends to establish inspection offices in eight places: Tianjin, Peiping, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Botouzhen, and Dukou to collect consumption taxes equal to one-eighth of the regular Chinese customs duties and permit free transport in Hebei and Chahar provinces and the cities of Peiping and Tianjin. According to yesterday's report, as of 8:00 PM on the first day, the Ministry of Finance has not received any notification from the Hebei-Chahar local authorities, nor has it received a formal report from the North China Customs. This statement is still in doubt. However, as the news came south, the cotton cloth market in our city was already affected. If this news is true, not only will the outbound route in North China be squeezed out, but the Central China sales market will also be affected. As a result, Tianjin buyers have shrunk. This is probably not limited to the cotton cloth industry.</p>
<p>Judging from the past words and deeds of the Hebei-Chahar local authorities, they contain consumption taxes that undermine the unified nature of customs administration. Even if there is local income, they would not lightly do this. To reduce the burden on the people and invigorate their economic capacity, it is not enough to reduce the import tax rate on foreign goods. Although reducing the import tax on foreign goods may temporarily benefit the Chinese people who like to use foreign goods, its ultimate goal is nothing more than consolidating the power of foreign goods, destroying our inherent industries, and hindering the revival of our national economy. This is a harm that ordinary people can understand. Can the Hebei-Chahar local authorities not see this? Therefore, we know that the transmission is not its truth.</p>
<p>However, striving to reduce our country's import tariffs is actually one of the established goals of a certain party. Large-scale smuggling is one end of it. Now that the prevention of smuggling is becoming more and more strict, their ambition cannot be fulfilled. They turn to using other methods to achieve their goals. It is inevitable. We still cannot bear to see our country's textile industry fall into the hands of foreigners. How can we sit back and watch all industries in the future not belong to us? For the sake of the overall situation and for the sake of our descendants, anything that hinders the survival of our nation should be held with the determination to die, unyielding, and arguing according to reason. It is also the common desire of the people to save a bit of vitality for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Goods are still circulating, so prices can often be self-adjusted to be fair. If a certain commodity is limited to being used in a certain area, seeking theoretical reasoning is not feasible, and seeking factual evidence is difficult. Therefore, it is known that it is incredible that goods subject to consumption tax are only limited to being used in the Hebei-Chahar region. Only then can our country's industry and commerce no longer be accustomed to the old ways and only resist foreign economic aggression by calling for gatherings. People are pushing forward with their strength. If we do not bury our heads and work hard, but still write articles like scholars, saying that if we have said something, it will be forgotten and people will not die, we will also kill ourselves. Our general public must no longer stand by and watch, merely blaming others for what is difficult, and forgetting the importance of their own responsibilities. In the current situation, there may be hope for a turning point if we have a spirit of perseverance, unite, work hard, and be practical.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle in Northern Spain: Government Forces in Peril; Rebel Army Launches Intense Land and Air Assault on Irún; Mount Txuriarte Ridge Captured</h3>
<p>Biarritz – Spanish government forces and rebel forces on the Irún front had temporarily ceased fighting to consolidate positions and repair defenses. However, this afternoon, the battle resumed fiercely. Both sides used machine guns and heavy artillery to bombard each other's positions. The situation for the government forces has suddenly deteriorated, with rebel forces almost entirely occupying Mount Txuriarte. The main line of defense outside Irún has been lost. Observers at the border believe the government forces are in extreme danger, as the rebels' occupation of the Txuriarte ridge allows them to control the main road from Irún to San Sebastián. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hendaye, Southern France – At dawn today, 1,500 rebel troops from the northern front, mostly Moroccan foreign legionnaires, launched another attack on Irún. Government troops bravely resisted. Heavy artillery and tanks participated in the land battle, while aircraft provided air support. The fierce battle lasted all day, resulting in a stalemate. It was one of the most intense battles since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. At noon, rebel aircraft dropped six large bombs on Irún, destroying the railway, station, and arsenal. The Convent of the Sacred Heart (now used as a military camp) also suffered significant damage. The explosions were so powerful that the ground even shook here in Hendaye. The rebel forces have now occupied several high points on Mount Txuriarte outside Irún and immediately installed artillery positions to bombard the city from above. In the afternoon, the rebels dispatched five armored vehicles along the main road outside Irún, opening fire on the Labanche heights, where government troops were positioned at noon. One government armored vehicle returned fire, destroying one of the rebel armored vehicles. At four o'clock in the afternoon, three government aircraft flew to the rebel positions and dropped several bombs. The rebels immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, driving them away and sending one aircraft in pursuit. The two aircraft engaged in aerial combat, exchanging machine-gun fire, but neither hit. The day's fighting resulted in no change in the positions of the two armies. The wounded government troops in Irún have been transported by several ambulances to the nearby port of San Sebastián for treatment. There was no fighting in the area around that port today. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Hendaye – Spanish government and rebel forces today resumed engaging each other with modern weaponry in the fight for the key city of Irún in northeastern Spain. Although the rebel artillery and occupied positions are superior to those of the government forces, the battle ended with no actual movement of the front lines. Government forces were forced to retreat from the banks of the Bidasoa River due to heavy artillery bombardment, and their position in San Marcial was also under constant bombardment. However, the troops loyal to the government held their main trenches and did not yield. When the fighting ceased at dusk, they still held their positions. During the engagement, artillery fire shook the heavens and the earth, and the rebel artillery fire seemed to be very accurate, so it is expected that the number of defenders killed will be very high. In the area holding the three-hundred-yard-long ridge overlooking Irún, no fewer than six hundred shells have fallen.</p>
<p>According to unofficial estimates, today's battle resulted in 1,600 dead and wounded. The heavy artillery bombardment on both sides caused extensive property damage. It is reported that no fewer than twenty-seven buildings were destroyed. The most severely damaged was the Jesus School, which is located near the railway station and is currently used as the headquarters of the labor union. The area along the Spanish-French border was also devastated by artillery fire. Shells, bombs, and bullets rained down all day near the French border. The red-roofed Spanish farmhouses between Arrantzale and Abentza are riddled with bullet holes. When the fighting stopped, many farmhouses were still billowing smoke.</p>
<p>General Mola, commander of the rebel forces in the north, personally visited the front lines today to supervise the battle. The most critical moment of the battle occurred shortly after noon when rebel armored vehicles drove to within a hundred yards of the government barracks, less than a mile from Behobia. The rebels launched repeated assaults but were repulsed by government machine-gun fire. The rebels eventually abandoned dozens of dead and wounded on the battlefield and retreated to their defensive positions. The government forces then deployed renowned bomb throwers, daring miners who fearlessly charged forward, using poorly made bombs and hand grenades. They bravely threw the grenades and explosives into the rebel ranks. Even veteran foreign legion soldiers were overwhelmed. When the artillery fire finally subsided, the government forces had expended a great deal of ammunition but achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Government pursuit planes and rebel bombers engaged in aerial combat several times during the day, and anti-aircraft guns fired frequently. The ambulance crews were extremely busy all day, making frequent trips up and down the hills around Irún, carrying wounded soldiers from the front lines to the aid stations as the battle raged. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>On-the-Ground Inspection of the Irún Front</h3>
<p>Hendaye – An inspection of the Irún front reveals that the rebels' heavy bombardment of government positions yesterday achieved nothing. The rebels have not dug new trenches, while government reinforcements are hiding in the craters left by the destroyed bunkers on the foothills. Rifle and machine-gun fire continued throughout the night, apparently to cover the noise of the armored vehicles transporting ammunition to the front lines. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Heavy Artillery Fire Shakes the Border with France; Government Troops Hold Firm in Trenches; Grenade Squads Show Remarkable Bravery</h3>
<p>Billière, Southern France – Today, heavy fighting occurred between government and rebel forces in northern Spain near the French border. Shells rained down on Billière (in Spanish territory) across the Bidasoa River, completely destroying the trenches. Many Spanish farmhouses with red tile roofs, renowned for scenic beauty, between Arrantzale and Labanche, were struck and burned. The fires are still burning. A portion of the nearby fir forest was also destroyed. This evening, rebel artillery began a heavy bombardment of government trenches. Through binoculars, it was evident the government forces sustained significant damage, but soldiers in the trenches remained steadfast, holding their original positions. They launched counterattacks with grenade squads, throwing grenades and explosives at the rebels, causing heavy casualties and forcing a slight retreat. At 6:00 PM, the rebel artillery, aided by the Fort Guadalupe battery, heavily bombarded Irún, hitting trenches and creating huge craters, with earth flying everywhere. However, the government forces fought bravely, and the trenches did not budge. The government artillery at Fuenterrabía returned fire, with two shells landing near the rebels' second line of defense on the mountainside. At 7:00 PM, the fighting was still ongoing. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Lisbon – General Mola, commander of the rebel forces in northern Spain, told visitors today that the day of the revolution's victory is approaching, but the war will likely last until the end of winter. He does not believe that the countries can maintain neutrality and criticized the French Popular Front for openly assisting the Spanish Marxists. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Official War Report: Victory After Victory on the Front Lines; Rebel Aircraft Continue to Bomb Madrid</h3>
<p>Madrid – Government forces in the north have intensified their pressure on the rebel forces in Huesca and have completely encircled the city, cutting off all communication. In the southwestern province of Extremadura, government forces are also achieving victory after victory. Regarding the Irún front in the north, although the rebel forces have attacked for seven consecutive days, they have not succeeded. All key strategic locations around the city, such as the Labanche plateau, remain under government control. Yesterday, the 50-member grenade squad was the most effective government unit. These soldiers are highly skilled and accurate in throwing grenades, causing repeated damage to the rebel positions and greatly shaking the rebel forces. Therefore, the grenade squad deserves the greatest credit. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Madrid – An aircraft listening post reported this morning that several rebel aircraft were flying toward the capital, intending to bomb it. The sirens were immediately sounded to warn the public to take shelter in cellars. At the same time, anti-aircraft guns opened fire on the rebel aircraft. The rebel aircraft were unsuccessful and returned to their base. After half an hour, the situation in the capital returned to normal. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Lisbon – The rebel radio station in Cádiz reported today that the rebel forces killed 300 people when they bombed the Ministry of War, the Ministry of the Interior, and the post office in Madrid on Friday night and Saturday morning. Meanwhile, the rebel radio station in Burgos claimed that rebel aircraft also bombed Navalperal, burning down the gasoline storage depot there. The number of casualties is unknown. However, the government radio station claimed that government aircraft dropped four bombs on Ávila, killing four people. (Guomin, 1st)</p>
<h3>Spanish Morocco: Indigenous People Showing Signs of Unrest; Dissatisfied with the Rebel Government; Refusing to Enlist</h3>
<p>Casablanca – Reliable sources here reported today that the indigenous people of Spanish Morocco are nearing open revolt against the rebel leaders' uprising. Although the military commander of the rebel forces has implemented repressive measures to suppress the unrest, it has only made the people more hostile to the rebel forces. It is claimed that the government has also sent people to lure the indigenous people with money and weapons, inciting them to revolt. It is reported that the indigenous people have stopped voluntarily enlisting in the rebel forces, even though the pay and food are better than their usual living standards. Today, indigenous leaders even visited Tetouan to protest the harsh policies of the rebel leaders and demanded the release of Touress, the Muslim leader currently detained in Ceuta. At the same time, 1,500 Arab women gathered at the rebel headquarters in Tetouan, demanding news of their husbands and requesting the food and money that had been promised. (Guomin, 1st)</p>
<p>Tangier, International Neutral Zone – Yesterday, reports emerged that the indigenous people of Spanish Morocco were increasingly dissatisfied with the rebel forces and refused to enlist, a situation that seemed quite serious. However, according to inquiries made by our reporter, order within the region is well maintained. However, the indigenous soldiers have occasionally expressed dissatisfaction because their pay is not delivered monthly. There are also Arab Muslims inciting the indigenous people not to cooperate with the rebel forces. As a result, the enlistment of indigenous people has virtually stopped. In addition, the Spanish Moroccan authorities have been treating people entering Spanish Morocco from Tangier and French Morocco quite harshly. The International Administration Committee of this port has therefore decided that all those arriving in this port from Spanish Morocco must present a passport. If the Spanish Moroccan authorities do not change their attitude, the International Committee plans to ban the export of automobiles to the region as a form of protest. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Málaga Coast – British and German Warships Bombed; Preparing to File Strong Protests with the Rebel Forces</p>
<p>Gibraltar – An accident occurred today near the Spanish port of Málaga, located sixty-five miles northeast of Gibraltar, involving the Spanish rebel forces and the navies of Great Britain and Germany. A rebel aircraft dropped four bombs on the British cruiser HMS "Wasps" and a German destroyer. Fortunately, all four bombs landed in the nearby water and did not hit. The incident was likely due to the aircraft mistaking the warships for Spanish government vessels. However, Great Britain and Germany are expected to file strong protests with the rebel headquarters in Burgos. It is said that this is the second time in recent days that foreign ships have been attacked by Spanish aircraft. The US destroyer "Kane" was bombed by a plane of unknown origin last Sunday, but was also not hit. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Spain: Cabinet Expands; Inviting Left-Wing Parties to Join the New Cabinet; Hoping for Effective Assistance from France</h3>
<p>Madrid – Former Socialist Party cabinet member Prieto told a reporter from Havas, "Prime Minister Quiroga is currently conducting negotiations to change and expand the current cabinet organization so that figures from parties of the Popular Front that have not yet joined the government, such as the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Basque Nationalist Party, can also join the cabinet." Referring to international issues, Prieto said, "I do not want to be critical of France's attitude towards us. However, if France were to go a little further than its current attitude and support the Spanish government, that is something France can and should do. Because other countries are providing assistance to the rebel forces, even if France has some reservations, it could still provide us with effective assistance." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Week of Prayers for World Peace in Churches Across Britain</h3>

<h3>Spanish Rebel Leader Promises Germany Territory in Exchange for Support: Reported by French Newspaper Reporter</h3>
<p>(Paris) Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the newspaper "L'Œuvre," recently stated that General Franco, leader of the rebel forces in southern Spain, had promised German leader Adolf Hitler that, once successful, he would cede the territory of Spanish Rio de Oro in Africa to Germany as a reward. Franco has also accepted the advice of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and made promises to Arab leaders in Spanish Morocco that, once victorious, he would grant the ten groups broad autonomy. They have now been permitted to publish a nationalist newspaper, "The Riff Tribune." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Holds Meeting; Discussing Three Current Issues; Baldwin and Eden Absent</h3>

<h3>Issue of the Non-Intervention Agreement: Britain Urges Germany and Portugal to Cooperate; Requesting Joining the International Coordinating Committee</h3>
<p>(London) France has proposed that a consultative committee be formed by representatives of the major powers participating in the non-intervention agreement on the Spanish Civil War. The British government also believes this is essential because without such a body, there would be no proper way to discuss the points of contention arising from the agreement. The British government also wants this committee to meet in London next week. France has asked Germany to join, and the British Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin, Newton, has also been instructed to assist France in urging the German government to cooperate with this initiative as soon as possible. Sir Wingfield, the British Ambassador to Lisbon, is also in contact with the Portuguese government on this matter. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office is rushing to convene an international committee to monitor the non-intervention policy of European powers in the Spanish Civil War. Officials here are very concerned about Portugal's active support for the rebel forces, despite its statements otherwise. There are also reports that German aircraft and personnel are serving the rebel forces. Therefore, it is believed here that the process of non-intervention policy must be completed quickly to avoid serious involvement of various countries in the Spanish political situation. (Guomin, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Portuguese Legation in Germany published a statement in the "Berliner Tageblatt" here regarding the adoption of a neutral policy on the Spanish Civil War, stating, "Although the Portuguese government generally accepts the notes from the British and French governments regarding the ban on arms, this acceptance is actually subject to certain reservations. Now, foreign newspapers only point out that the Portuguese government has accepted the proposals of Britain and France, implying that this acceptance is not subject to reservations, or that even if there are reservations, they are not important to the Portuguese government and the governments participating in the arms embargo agreement. This is truly regrettable." The most important reservations put forward by the Portuguese government are two: (1) The Soviet Union must accept the non-intervention agreement at the same time as all relevant countries; (2) Portugal's security must be guaranteed.

(Reuters, 1st)</p>

<h3>Naval Issues: Japanese Reply to Britain; Requesting Increased Submarine Tonnage</h3>
<p>(London) The British government informed the Japanese and US governments on July 15th of this year that it intends to invoke the escalator clause of the 1930 London Naval Treaty to maintain the total tonnage of destroyers at 190,000 tons (the London Naval Treaty stipulated 150,000 tons) due to the additional naval power reserved by other countries. Japanese Ambassador Shigeru Yoshida delivered his government's reply to the British government this morning, stating that after the British government increased the total tonnage of destroyers stipulated in the London Naval Treaty by 40,000 tons, Japan could originally increase the total tonnage of destroyers by 28,000 tons according to the ratio. However, it only wants to increase it by 11,590 tons, and increase the submarine tonnage by 15,598 tons, totaling 27,188 tons, to compensate. Officials in the British government declined to comment on Japan's reply. Political figures believe that although Japan has requested an increase in the total tonnage of submarines, the British government will not invoke the escalator clause again and propose an increase in the total tonnage of submarines. They said that although Japan's action is not legal, it is still honest and forthright. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Stalin Ill? Bizarre Reports from French Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Paris) "Le Matin" received a report from its Moscow correspondent stating that it is widely rumored that Stalin is seriously ill. Stalin suffered from liver disease in 1926, which prevented him from engaging in politics for three years. The fact that Stalin did not attend the performance of the Zorkina Art Troupe in Moscow has increased the credibility of this rumor, as the troupe is specially invited by Stalin every year. The correspondent also said that at the official banquet for the troupe, a toast was raised to the "absent and fatigued" Stalin. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Resolving Border Disputes: Manchukuo and Mongolia Reopen Negotiations at the End of This Month in Manchouli</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the imminent reopening of the "Manchu-Mongol Conference," a TASS correspondent stationed in Ulan Bator (Kulun) has obtained reliable information from the Mongolian side. It is said that since the meeting of Mongol and "Manchu" representatives held at Manchouli Station in 1935, which broke down at the end of November due to the excessive demands of the Manchukuo representatives, it is well known that border conflicts occurred frequently in the area of Buir Lake in December, January, and February. As a result, the border situation in "Manchukuo" has become unusually tense. Based on its consistent sincerity in peacefully resolving border disputes, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic sent a telegram to the "Manchu" government on February 29 of this year, suggesting the immediate formation of a committee to investigate the situation and causes of the border conflicts. However, the "Manchukuo" government's reply to the above suggestion put forward many demands that the Mongolian government could not accept, and stated that acceptance of these demands was a prerequisite for reopening negotiations. However, in subsequent telegraphic negotiations, the "Manchu" side abandoned its proposed preconditions. As a result of the exchange of letters between the two sides, they both agreed to reopen the conference at Manchouli Station on September 25 of this year to discuss the establishment of two joint Mongol-Manchu committees, one dedicated to investigating the existing border between Mongolia and Manchukuo, and the other dedicated to investigating the circumstances and causes of past conflicts, in order to resolve border incidents. In addition to the second committee, both sides should also dispatch several permanent official representatives to resolve all border disputes and determine the areas where these representatives will be stationed.

<h3>Soviet Russia Reduces Military Service Age; 600,000 Young People Conscripted; Army Exceeds 1.3 Million; France Considers Extending Military Service Length</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Six hundred thousand young people born in 1914-1915 were conscripted today. It is said that although this step will temporarily cause the Soviet army to greatly exceed its usual strength of 1.3 million soldiers, the size of the Soviet army will return to its normal state after the oldest age groups are finally discharged. This Soviet conscription of all those born in 1914 and half of those born in 1915 has brought into effect the recent order reducing the age of military service to nineteen. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing *Figaro* recently reported that after Germany lengthened the term of compulsory military service, the French government intends to extend the term of military service (currently two years) as a countermeasure. Defense Minister Daladier met with President Lebrun, Senate Army Committee Chairman Vansant, and House Army Committee Chairman La Chambre yesterday to discuss this matter, and the meeting lasted a long time. The Council of Ministers will also discuss this matter at its meeting on Friday, September 4. The newspaper also said that Daladier and Vansant both advocated increasing the term of military service to two and a half years, which La Chambre and left-wing figures still consider insufficient. The government's decision on this matter will likely be based on the opinion of the High Committee of National Defense. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the newspaper *Figaro* issued a report stating that the German government intended to lengthen the term of compulsory military service and the French government also intended to take similar measures to counter it, those in charge recently announced that the cabinet is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's Office at 4:00 PM on the 7th of this month, at which time Defense Minister Daladier will propose various measures to deal with Germany. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Qidong (Communist Party member), the vice chairman of the House Army Committee, recently sent a letter to La Chambre, the chairman of the committee, requesting the immediate convening of the committee to discuss the issue of extending the term of military service. La Chambre replied that this matter would be determined by the cabinet's opinion, and that the Army Committee could be convened after the Council of Ministers and the military authorities in charge had thoroughly studied it. According to legal regulations, the term of military service in the French army was originally only one year, but due to the reduced birth rate during the European War, the number of new recruits from 1935 to May 1940 was greatly insufficient, so the term of military service was increased to two years to remedy the situation.

<h3>Russia and Spain Celebrate International Youth Day; Large-Scale Parades and Demonstrations Held; Slogans Shouting Against Fascism</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, large-scale parades and demonstrations were held in both Madrid and Moscow to celebrate International Youth Day. In Madrid, more than 100,000 people, including militiamen, members of the People's Front, and various children's groups, paraded through the streets, claiming that their parades and demonstrations were a countermeasure against the ineffective air raids by the rebel forces. The celebration ceremony in Moscow was even larger in scale, with about 500,000 young men and women, including the recently conscripted soldiers, all parading inside Red Square, where they were inspected by Chairman Molotov of the People's Committee and Defense Commissioner Voroshilov. Despite the cold weather and incessant rain, the men and women in this parade still marched through the city for several hours, singing and dancing along the way, and shouting "Down with Fascism." Each marcher held wooden signs, flags, and satirical drawings, most of which were against Hitler and Fascism, and expressed disapproval of the Spanish government. One student held a wooden sign with the words "The world today is on the eve of Fascist Germany and militarist Japan carrying out wars to conquer others." (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday was the 22nd International Youth Day. The Moscow Youth Association held a grand demonstration parade.

On the platform were Motov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Andreyev, Gyumar, Khrushchev, Budyonny, Secretary Lukyanov of the Central Committee of the All-Union League of Young Communists, and other party and state leaders. After the youth parade, there was a parade of armed members of the Communist Youth League. In addition to Moscow, youth in other cities and towns in the Soviet Union also held grand commemorative activities. (TASS Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Explanation from German Nationals in Shanghai Regarding Germany's Extension of Military Service</h3>
<p>National News Agency Report: Our agency's reporter noted that Germany's recent extension of the term of military service from one year to three years has caused considerable surprise internationally, with many fearing that a new major war will arise as a result. However, the actual situation is quite different. It is undeniable that the countries of Europe are at odds. If one wishes to maintain peace in this situation, the only way to do so is to ensure that the strength of each country is equal. Recently, Soviet Russia advanced the conscription age to nineteen, a move that would allow the Red Army to increase by two million men in peacetime. In addition, the term of military service in countries such as Soviet Russia, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Japan is two years, and Italy's is eighteen months. In March of this year, France changed its term of military service to two years, citing the reasons that there were not many children born during the European War and that the number of soldiers was lacking, as well as military training. Why should this be any different for Germany? Because soldiers in the new era must have the ability to act independently and must have technical knowledge. A one-year term of military service is difficult to provide sufficient training. However, even under these circumstances, Germany initially still implemented a one-year term of military service in the hope that other countries would follow suit. Later, in view of the fact that neighboring countries not only still adhered to the two-year military service system, but also, among them, especially Soviet Russia, continued to expand without end, it had no choice but to change the term of military service to two years to compare with other countries, with no other intention. Germany's move is not only for its own security, but also for the security of Europe. In short, the German people and their government desire peace as much as other countries, but in view of the fact that the military preparations of other countries are a major threat to Germany's security and world peace, it has no choice but to take this step to adapt to its environment. The above are the opinions of German nationals in Shanghai that our reporter interviewed.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The General Office of the National Election answered the questions from the Chief Supervisor of the Jiangsu Election, stating that "the heads of all levels" mentioned in Article 58 of the Election Law refer to the heads of government offices at all levels. All responsible personnel of county government affiliated agencies, such as the heads of various bureaus, district chiefs of sub-district offices, and directors of public funds and property management offices, are subject to the same restrictions. However, the directors of relief homes, county hospitals, and county opium suppression centers fall within the scope of social undertakings and should not be subject to these restrictions. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the election affairs of military representatives, since national ID cards for all officers and soldiers cannot be universally issued, the question arises as to whether their citizenship status still exists after voting and upon retirement. The General Office of the National Election previously requested clarification and the response was: After an elector votes, the voting manager will stamp the words "Voting Completed" on the citizen's card and return the original card. Therefore, whether citizenship exists should be determined by whether or not a citizen's card is held. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Provincial Party Headquarters of Shandong previously telegraphed requesting clarification on whether section chiefs and others in counties where bureaus have been abolished and departments merged are subject to the restrictions of Article 58 of the detailed rules. The General Office of the National Election has replied by telegram stating that, in counties where bureaus have been abolished and departments merged, although the personnel administration and powers of the section chiefs and directors are the same as those of bureaus, there is a distinction according to the County Organization Law and the Outline of Measures for Abolishing Bureaus and Merging Departments in Anti-Banditry Provinces. They are merely assistant administrators of the county government and should not be considered "heads of government offices." Therefore, they should not be subject to the restrictions of Article 58 of the implementing rules. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Office of the National Election recently answered three questions raised by the Chief Supervisor of the Hunan Election: Each county must have at least one candidate. If the number of candidates initially nominated in each county is less than the statutory number, should a second nomination be held? The law does not explicitly stipulate this, but in terms of electoral duties and rights, a second nomination may be held. However, only one supplementary nomination is allowed. The minimum number of votes required is five. If this number is not reached, a supplementary nomination is not allowed, but only one supplementary nomination should be held. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Office of the National Election recently answered questions from the Chief Supervisor of the Jiangsu Election regarding the participation of industrial and commercial organizations in the election: A shop that has joined a chamber of commerce, only its representative may be regarded as a member of a member organization under Article 24, Section 2 of the Election Law. According to the precedent of the National Assembly, they are allowed to participate in the election, but they do not have the right to nominate. Others who meet the qualifications of Article 3 of the Election Law should still be regional voters. Whether members of industrial organizations can be voters in the elections of their respective professional organizations depends on whether the organization is a trade union established in accordance with the Trade Union Law. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Office of the National Election previously approved a letter from the General Office of the election of representatives of free professional groups requesting clarification of ambiguities. The General Office answered them item by item. The members of a faculty organization that encompasses a university or independent college are limited to faculty members of that university or college when elected. The qualifications of members of faculty organizations are not explicitly stipulated in the Election Law and its implementing rules. Therefore, according to the Regulations on the Qualifications of University Faculty, all professors, lecturers, assistant instructors, and part-time teachers of a university or independent college should be included. However, their candidate qualifications must fully comply with the provisions of Article 21 of the Election Law. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The special district of the city has a citizen population of over 4,000, but has long lacked a self-governing organization. Therefore, in the Hankou regional election for the National Assembly representatives, the district should establish a temporary nomination district and elect three temporary fang chiefs to serve as nominators for the Hankou representatives. It was reported on the 2nd that citizens in the district used communication methods to elect Xu Weirong, Tang Lujian, and Zhou Xichen as temporary fang chiefs.

<h3>Rumors of the Dalai Lama's Reincarnation Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Reuters dispatch from the 1st, there are rumors that the 14th Dalai Lama has been reincarnated somewhere in Tibet. Reporters inquired with relevant parties, who all stated that they have not received such reports. Even the most recent telegrams from Tibet did not mention this matter. It is difficult to confirm this rumor without inquiring with the Tibetan side. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Yun, the former special envoy escorting the Panchen Lama into Tibet, resigned and left Qinghai last month, arriving in Nanjing on the evening of the 31st. On the 2nd, he visited Wu Zhongxin, Weng Wenhao, and Jiang Tingfu at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan to report on the preparations for the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet. He then visited Zhao Shouyu, the newly appointed special envoy, urging him to go to Qinghai as soon as possible. It is learned that the Panchen Lama has left Labrang Monastery and set off for Tibet, accompanied by all his staff and entourage. According to the itinerary, he is expected to arrive at Jialasi Temple in the next day or two, stay there for a week, and continue west, arriving in Yushu County on the Tibetan border in early October. The Panchen Lama's travelling headquarters telegraphed Nanjing on the 1st, urging Zhao Shouyu to depart as soon as possible. The Panchen Lama intends to wait in Yushu to travel to Lhasa together. It takes more than a month to travel from Yushu to Lhasa. The Panchen Lama is expected to arrive in Tibet within the Gregorian calendar year. The people of both the front and rear Tibet are preparing to welcome him. A telegram was recently sent stating that the Dalai Lama has been reincarnated in a certain place. According to the Dalai Lama's office, no telegram has been received. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission telegraphed Tibet to inquire. One rumor is that when the Panchen Lama was in Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai, he conveyed that the Dalai Lama had been reincarnated within the territory. The truth of the matter is yet to be verified. It is understood that, according to past customs for the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama, they are both generated through mutual prayers and must undergo proper elections. Therefore, after the passing of the 13th Dalai Lama, the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama must wait for the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet, undergo prayers, and send personnel out to search before it can be determined. The rites are very complex. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Communications, the promotion of postal services in Tibet was previously impossible due to unrest and traffic obstruction in the Kham and Tibet regions. Now that the Panchen Lama is entering Tibet, the Directorate General of Posts is sending personnel to Gansu to accompany him. After conducting on-the-ground surveys of the situation in various places, further planning will be carried out. Xikang is the throat of transportation between Tibet and the inland. In the future, it is planned to expand the postal route westward from Xikang as the first step. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Industry Arrived in Nanjing to Petition the Ministry</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Industry Association dispatched representatives Ba Lunquan, Chen Guanyu, and Chen Jieqing to Beijing on the 1st to petition the Ministry of Finance because the Tianjin Customs had investigated and registered the stockpiles of artificial silk yarn and finished piece goods, as well as the ramie silk on the machines, in various textile factories in Tianjin but had not released them. The customs also ordered the payment of taxes on the ramie silk for our piece goods, which has greatly affected the industry. As it was late, they did not get to meet with the responsible personnel. On the morning of the 2nd, they went to the Ministry of Finance to submit their petition in person and met with Wu Jing, chief of the Customs Administration Section of the Customs Service, to express their grievances and request: 1. The 244,105 pieces of stockpiled piece goods have been registered in accordance with the Ministry's order. Please order the customs to issue transportation and sales licenses as soon as possible. 2. Please grant a tax exemption for the ramie silk used for the piece goods on the machines. 3. For the stockpiled artificial silk, except for those with customs receipts, please complete the tax payment in accordance with the Ministry's order. Please approve this in order to relieve the difficulties of the merchants. According to Ba Lunquan, there are a total of 296 weaving factories in Tianjin, with more than 9,000 looms and more than 100,000 workers. Since these piece goods cannot be transported and sold, the factories have had to painfully suspend operations, incurring heavy losses, and the workers' lives have fallen into misery. This trip to Beijing is not only to appeal on behalf of the factories but also on behalf of the workers. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Zhu Shouguang Denies that the Japanese Established a Special Agency in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Tianjin newspaper reported a conversation with Wazhi Ying'er, the former Japanese military attaché stationed in Taiyuan and currently a senior staff officer of the Tianjin Garrison. He said that he recently came to Taiyuan to introduce the new chief of the special agency, Kawano, to the senior officials of Shanxi. Furthermore, due to the frequent flights of Japanese aircraft over Taiyuan, residents have expressed considerable concern. A reporter recently visited Zhu Shouguang, chief of staff of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, to inquire about the truth of these two matters. He replied that the claim that the Japanese have established a special agency in Taiyuan and that Wazhi introduced the new chief, Kawano, are both false rumors. This spring, when the communists were disturbing Shanxi, the Japanese requested to station personnel in Taiyuan for research purposes. We only approved one researcher. Wazhi used this title. The Japanese aircraft have been coming to Taiyuan every other day without our prior consent and acting completely freely. We are currently doing our best to negotiate and stop this in accordance with international norms. Yamada Hideyoshi, the Japanese researcher stationed in Taiyuan, has been transferred to Tianjin and will be succeeded by the military attaché Tanaka Yoshitaro. Yamada will host a farewell banquet for all parties tonight. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Reed Salt Shipped to Japan for Export Within the Month</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Consul Nagai stated that the first batch of 70,000 tons of reed salt to be shipped to Japan will be loaded onto ships for export this month. However, Hangu is 140 li from Tanggu by land, making transportation difficult and time-consuming. It will take at least 20 days for the ships to export. Salt merchants in Dagu oppose the export of salt. Since Japanese merchants have not purchased salt produced in that area, there is no direct problem. This batch of salt will be shipped, and no more purchases will be made this year. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin has dispatched engineers to build an automobile road connecting the Hangu salt flats to Dagu in order to facilitate the export of reed salt. Next year, 1.2 million tons of reed salt will be purchased for chemical use. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy Towards China: From Military to Diplomatic, From Political to Economic</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: After arriving in Tokyo, the most common slogan we heard was "Establish a diplomatic national policy." We found this truly surprising. Did Japan not have a "diplomatic national policy" before the September 18th Incident? Has Japan still not had a "diplomatic national policy" since the September 18th Incident? If it truly has not, then what has guided Japan's diplomatic work in these past five years? From "scorched earth diplomacy" to "harmonious diplomacy," hasn't Japan fully demonstrated its diplomatic guiding spirit on the world stage? The more we pondered, the less we understood. After much observation, we came to a conclusion: the so-called call to "establish a diplomatic national policy" arises from the following two viewpoints: First, some enlightened people deeply feel that the existing diplomatic national policy contains many dangers. Without fundamental reform, it will inevitably encounter enormous difficulties. Second, some enlightened people also keenly feel that to implement the existing diplomatic national policy, it is necessary to simultaneously expand the army, navy, and air force. The burden of military expenses is too heavy, and the development of industry will naturally be severely squeezed. Furthermore, other necessary administrative tasks will be affected by financial difficulties and cannot be realized quickly. Therefore, they call for a change in diplomatic national policy. The word "establish" used under these two viewpoints is actually a substitute for "change" or "reform."</p>
<p>What is Japan's current diplomatic national policy? This question is difficult for us to answer. Diplomatic national policy inherently contains secrecy, and it is naturally not something we can know. However, judging from national actions, it is not impossible to infer some fragments. Japan's diplomatic national policy—by carefully observing its attitude towards the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and the United States—seems not impossible to understand. This does not need our explanation. Recently, Foreign Minister Arita indirectly responded to society's demands for a definite diplomatic national policy in a cabinet meeting. Although not very detailed, we can see its trend. Foreign Minister Arita said, "We have a diplomatic national policy. We take dealing with the Soviet Union as the center of our diplomatic national policy. Because policy toward China is related to policy toward the Soviet Union, it must also be handled cautiously." At the same time, the army also said, "Japan's diplomatic national policy has long been determined. Now it is just a matter of implementation. Military strength is the basic condition for diplomacy, so military expansion is necessary." The statements of both the Foreign Ministry and the Army are very clear. However, Foreign Minister Arita's words only stated one aspect; another aspect is implied. In our view, the military aspect is naturally centered on dealing with the Soviet Union, while the political and economic aspects are naturally centered on dealing with China. Dealing with the Soviet Union and China are mutually causal. Because of the need to deal with the Soviet Union, China must be treated cautiously. Because of the need to deal with China, the Soviet Union must be treated cautiously. To go a step further, policy toward China is the center of Japan's diplomatic national policy. Policy towards the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States all arise from this. People who have studied Japan's diplomatic history for the past sixty years can assert this. Therefore, when we understand Japan's policy toward China, we can recognize the entirety of Japan's diplomatic national policy.</p>
<p>After the resolution of the Southwestern Rebellion, Japanese people's views toward China gradually changed. This is a fact. They had always believed that China absolutely had no ability to unify and would forever be in chaos. Therefore, Japan did not need to observe China from the perspective of an entire nation. All kinds of policies toward China came from this fundamental theory. However, recently, because the Guangdong forces collapsed too quickly and internal strife has almost disappeared in the past five years, and the cause of unification has now reached about 90%, they gradually recognized that China's future for unification does not have great difficulties, and its strength of unity is not weak. Therefore, calls for re-examining policy toward China arose simultaneously in various circles. We will cite several examples for readers to see. Mr. Takagi Rikuro is one of the leading "China experts" among Japanese capitalists. On August 15, he published an article titled "Recent Movements in China" in "Diplomatic Times," and in the September issue of "Bungei Shunju," he published an article titled "Chiang Kai-shek's Financial Network." The main ideas of the two articles are the same, listing the progress of China's railways, highways, aviation, banking system, currency reform, postal savings, political control, scientific application, etc., in recent years, hoping that Japanese people will re-recognize China. He said, "People who only know the old China, discussing Japan's policy toward China, on the contrary, cause Japan to make mistakes. This is my frequent feeling." Mr. Sogawa Shinji is the president of the Yu-Zhong Company, which operates in Hebei, and is also a "China expert." He published an article titled "The Turning Point of Policy Toward China" in the September issue of "Bungei Shunju." He said, "If Japan only wants to have everything it asks for, then there is no need to say anything. But if we recognize China as our brotherly country, supporting each other, stabilizing East Asia, and increasing the welfare of the people, then the past policy toward China cannot but be said to be a failure. Japan asks China to reflect, but Japan should also clear away everything of the past, returning to a blank slate, and reforming policy toward China from the very first step is most necessary." He also said, "In short, whether Japanese soldiers, diplomats, civilian researchers, or China specialists, if they do not observe from the overall situation of the world, and regard the China problem as a world problem, merely confined to within the four hundred-odd states, observing China, discussing China, this is a fundamental error. They not only forget the world, but also do not have sufficient contact with the Chinese people in China. Their targets are only the warlords' powerful figures, and the local bullies and gentry-style capitalist compradores whom the people despise. They even believe that if they can manipulate them to serve Japan's current interests, they are confident that they are pursuing a policy toward China." This is a very fair argument. The famous Japanese reporter Ota Unosuke wrote an article titled "China Will Complete Its Unification" in the September issue of "Nippon Hyoron." He concluded by saying, "If China has no peace, then East Asia has no peace. If China is not unified, then China has no peace. If China does not have complete independence, then there is no true cooperation between China and Japan. Today is the time for Japan to change its view of China and even its view of the world." We believe that this is an immortal saying. We have never seen this kind of argument in the past five years. Ishimaru Tota is a well-known commentator among Japanese naval officers (now retired). In his new book "The Next World War," he discusses the causes of the future world war. In the chapter "Examining Japan-Soviet-China Relations," he said, "International relations are only about interests, and the center of promoting interests is the principle of give and take in diplomacy. In other words, when 'giving' and 'taking' can maintain balance, friendly relations can be maintained between the two countries. If not, relations will inevitably become estranged, eventually leading to 'taking' without 'giving,' developing into hostile relations... If China and Japan cannot maintain a balanced state of 'giving' and 'taking,' isn't it natural for China to adopt the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians? Therefore, asking China to reflect is truly nonsense from outsiders who do not know the basics of diplomacy." In the chapter "Can the Pacific War Be Avoided?" he also said, "Some say that the National Government's pro-Japan stance is fake. Please watch as it immediately takes off its mask and resists Japan again. As if seeing through Chiang's belly, they shout loudly, 'Power! Power! For China, power is the first. Only with power can China be subdued.' From the beginning, it is a fighting spirit. Then what is there to turn to or not turn to? It can be said that diplomacy is fundamentally useless. What is there to say about Sino-Japanese friendship work?' These conflicting opinions form a double diplomacy, which is truly Japan's misfortune." This person's argument is truly extremely sharp. He also said, "Which side China stands on in the next world war depends on Japan's attitude. If China and Japan can truly achieve the goal of cooperation, the Japan-US and Japan-Soviet wars may even be avoided. In any case, Japan's attitude is the decisive factor." His vision is broad and his observation is thorough. We can only admire him. The Osaka Mainichi and Tokyo Nichinichi newspapers, which have always seemed to hold a prejudice against the China problem, have also gradually turned around in the past half month. Isn't this hinting at a change in the times? However, readers should not be too optimistic. Although this kind of argument can gradually be seen in society, the timing is probably not yet ripe for it to gain decisive power in diplomacy and politics.</p>
<p>We have quoted many arguments, which seems to have deviated from the topic. So, has there really been a change in the substance of the Japanese government's policy toward China? It is very obvious that there is a shift from military work to diplomatic work, and from political work to economic work. The first thing Ambassador Kawagoe said upon taking office was the "theory of economic cooperation." After Foreign Minister Arita took office, he also emphasized the necessity of "economic diplomacy." These are all worthy of our attention. Japan is currently encountering many difficulties in trade and is hitting walls everywhere. If it does not open up a path from the economic aspect, not only will international trade be greatly affected, but domestic industry and commerce will also suffer related deterioration. Paying attention to the economic development of Hebei is one reason. Using Hebei's rich resources to enrich Japan's broader national defense and increase Japan's industry and commerce is an unbeatable strategy. Japan's view of China seems to be a little different recently. The Southwestern problem was a huge turning point. They know that China is not "Wu Xia Ameng." The central control is powerful. The form of the entire country is complete. The era of diplomatic work based on various localities has passed. China's target is only one National Government. Therefore, the requirements to resolve pending issues, reduce tariffs, economic cooperation methods, etc., must all be negotiated through diplomatic channels. Restoring diplomatic normalcy cannot but be said to be a preliminary improvement. Japan feels the necessity of unifying diplomacy, perhaps to the same extent as China. Although the issue of unifying diplomacy has been pending for 30 years, judging from the facts of the past five years, both countries' enlightened people particularly keenly feel that correction is a matter of urgency. Efforts were made in the Hirota era, but unfortunately, they did not achieve much. In the Arita era, further efforts must of course be made to achieve it. Under the current situation, the degree of unification seems to have reached 70%. There is still a key issue that has not been completely resolved. Currently, within the cabinet, the foreign, army, and navy ministers are sure to gather after the cabinet meeting every week to discuss the problems of China and the Soviet Union. They often discuss them, and their opinions are easily unified. The environment for unification is much better than before. If the central government and those abroad can completely agree, then unified diplomacy can be realized. We earnestly hope that China and Japan first restore diplomatic normalcy, and then talk about concrete problems. I am afraid that many enlightened people in Japan hold the same opinion. Today, people in the country want to ask what Japan's policy toward China is. We have only one answer. The famous reporter Ota said, "Only when China has complete independence can there be true cooperation between China and Japan." In the same style, we want to say, "Only when China has an entire nation can Japan have a rational policy toward China."</p>
<h3>The Guangdong-Hankou Railway Officially Opens to Traffic: Direct Journey in 44 Hours, Opening Ceremony Scheduled for Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which the whole country has been looking forward to, has now officially opened to direct traffic. The construction of this road has a history of 35 years and has great significance in terms of politics, economy, culture, and national defense. It not only connects the north and south but also facilitates transportation. The first express train started from Guangzhou on September 1, and from Wuchang on the 4th. The train numbers are designated as No. 41 southbound and No. 42 northbound. From then on, express trains will run north and south every Tuesday and Friday, requiring 44 hours for the entire journey. In the future, it can be shortened to 36 hours. The fare is calculated at 1.25 cents per kilometer, with third-class at $13.70, second-class at $27.40, and first-class at $41.20. The special express train between Wuchang and Hengyang still runs as usual every night. The Railway Bureau stipulates that a station be set up in Hengzhou, but currently it is temporarily set up in Wuchang. Director Ling Hongxun has gone south to preside over the grand opening ceremony to be held in Wuchang on the Double Tenth Festival. The construction history, construction progress, reorganization of the Railway Bureau, unification of railway administration, and stations, scenery, and products along the way are investigated in detail and recorded on the left, which I think is also what the people of the country want to hear.</p>
<p>The Construction Process of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is the only trunk line in South China, spanning the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong. It starts from Wuchang in the north and ends in Guangzhou in the south, with a total length of 1,090 kilometers. Ten years ago, the Englishman Stephen first proposed the idea of building the road, and it was not approved until 1898. The Sino-American Development Company undertook the construction. In that year, the Spanish-American War was extended, and construction began in the autumn of the following year. After only surveying, the budget of 4 million pounds was insufficient for wages, and it stopped because of a request to revise the contract. In the spring of 1900, the government completed the revision of the contract. In 1902, the Guangzhou to Sanshui line via Foshan began construction. In 1904, the Guangzhou-Sanshui line was completed. At that time, Belgium planned to sign a treaty with our country, but it was rejected by the Chinese people. Then came the American Morgan Company, which was opposed by the Chinese people. The government then gave 6,750,000 gold dollars, with 3,750,000 gold dollars as interest losses and 3,000,000 gold dollars as compensation for suspension of work, canceling the contract with the American company. This kind of contract compensation was then borrowed from the Hong Kong government for pounds, the so-called Wuchang loan of 1906. Afterwards, Chinese people raised funds to organize a company to continue construction. In 1915, the section from Guangzhou to was completed. The northern section, Hubei, obtained the British Hubei-Guangdong Railway loan and also built from Wuchang to the Hunan border. Construction started in the first year of the Republic of China and stopped due to the outbreak of war. Later, the northern section was extended to Changsha, with a length of 417 kilometers, all of which were the Hunan-Hubei Railway. The southern section from Guangzhou to had a length of 213 kilometers, named the Yue-Shaoguan Railway, while the middle section, Zhuzhou to Shaoguan, was 450 kilometers long, accounting for 40% of the remaining road. The Zhushao Road from was difficult, with a vast project, lasting up to 11 years. In the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Railways of the National Government intended to use the Boxer Indemnity and the income from the southern section for construction, proposing 1.66 million pounds for the purchase of materials abroad and 30 million yuan for the purchase of materials and wages in the country. The project then proceeded smoothly, and today the entire line is open to direct traffic. The northern road can be a state-owned railway trunk line with the unanimous efforts of the court and the public. In the future, after connecting with the Pinghan Railway, it can go south to Guangzhou and north to Beiping. We are very pleased to see the entire line open to traffic today.</p>
<p>Progress of the Zhushao Section Project</p>
<p>The Zhushao section project is the most difficult in the entire road. It accounts for three-quarters in Hunan Province and one-quarter in Guangdong Province. In the 22nd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Railways decided to complete the road and appointed Ling Hongxun as the director and chief engineer of the Zhushao section. The bureau was set up on the east bank of the Xiangjiang River in Hengyang, and the Zhushao section project was scheduled to be completed in four years. In fact, construction has been underway to date. Because of phased construction and scientific management, it was completed in only two years and eight months. The funds used were borrowed by the Ministry of Railways from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee. Domestic construction funds used 38,332,000 yuan, and foreign material funds used 1,645,000 pounds, totaling 60 million national currency. The estimated price per kilometer is about 150,000 yuan. Steel rails were purchased from the United Kingdom. North of Hengzhou, medicine-treated American pine was used for sleepers, and south of Hengzhou, hard rosewood was used. The roadbed is made of red soil from open mountains, which is the most viscous. Stone ballast uses pebbles from the Xiangjiang River, or crushed stones from open mountains are paved, which is very suitable. There are many outstanding projects. The most difficult ones for the construction industry are the mountains and valleys, including Jinlong Mountain, Jiaowan, Yantang, the Guangdong-Hunan border, Chong, and three. In Hengyang North, there are three major steel bridges: the steel bridge, 240.6 meters long, the Xiangjiang River, 397 meters long, and the Xiangjiang River Bridge, 439.5 meters long. The large arch bridges are the Xin Yanxia Bridge, the Dui Chong Bridge, the Provincial Boundary Bridge, the Fengkou Bridge, and the Yantang Bridge. There are a total of 1,322 bridges and culverts of various types, with a construction cost of more than 12 million yuan. The speed of construction and the greatness of the results are second only to the Jing-Sui Road (Jing-Zhang section) completed by Zhan Tianyou. From this, it can be seen that my country's engineering community has made significant progress.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Railway Bureau and Unifying Railway Administration</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Hankou Railway, due to the obstruction of the Zhushao section, has not been open to traffic for a long time, and management is divided into three sections: the Guangzhou-Shaoguan in the south, the Hunan-Hubei in the north, and each has its own management bureau, and the Zhushao in the middle has an engineering bureau. In recent years, the Ministry of Railways has established the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Planning and Organizing Committee. Although it is a design agency, the unity of the entire road has begun to take shape. On August 1 this year, the Ministry ordered the reorganization of the committee into the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Organizing Committee, with Chen Yanjiong as the chairman, Li Xian'gen, Yin Deyang, and Ling Hongxun as standing committee members. The three section bureaus were abolished and reorganized into the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Administration, with Ling Hongxun as the director and Zhou Zhongqi and Wang Renkang as his deputies. The characteristics of its organization are that there is no train affairs and machinery affairs department, and a transport affairs department is set up to manage the original train affairs and machinery affairs departments' driving management and vehicle dispatch, so as to achieve the effect of locomotive cooperation. A business office is set up to take charge of passenger and freight business and water and land combined transport, so as to seek the commercialization of the railway. A factory affairs office is also added, with a total of six major offices. Liu Chenghou is the director of the general affairs office, and Qu Jiaying is the deputy director. The office is responsible for six sections: writing, personnel, industry and health, affairs, materials, and the material factory. Chen Xiaogang is the director of the transport affairs office, and Feng Jian is the deputy director. The office is responsible for four sections: transfer, transport affairs, mechanics, and accounting, and the transport station. Zhou Zhongqi is the director of the business office, and Kaihua is responsible for the passenger and freight sections and the business station. Li Guo is the director of the engineering office, and Wen is the deputy director. The office is responsible for the construction and design sections and the engineering section and the engineering. Zi is the director of the factory affairs office, and Cheng Wenxi is the deputy director. The office is responsible for the management and sections and the factory. Cao is the director, and is responsible for the sections. A liaison office is set up in Guangzhou and is responsible for the and sections. Therefore, the regulations are unified, and the authority can be concentrated. The vehicles purchased by the bureau are ordered from the United Kingdom, including 28 locomotives, 50 passenger cars, including 5 first-class sleeping cars, 5 second-class sleeping cars, 5 dining cars, 5 baggage cars, 5 mail cars, and 425 freight cars, which are enough to equip 5 passenger trains to run on the entire line. Most of the various vehicles have been shipped, and the rest will be shipped to Wuchang for installation before the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Stations, Scenery, and Products Along the Way</p>
<p>The railway stations from Wuchang to Guangzhou are Xujiapeng, Tongxiangmen, Yujiawan, Zhifang, Tuditang, Shanpo, Heshengqiao, Guanbuqiao, Xianning, Tingsiqiao, Zhonghuopoo, Putai, Chaanling, Zhaoliqiao, Yanglousi, Linxiang, Lukoupoo, Yunxi, Chenglingji, Yuezhou, Matang, Rongjiawan, Huangshajie, Taolin Temple, Miluo, Baishui, Gaojiafang, Qiaotoubu, Xiani, Changshabei, Changshadong, Dabeipoo, Lujiawan, Zhuzhou, Kou, Sanmen, Zhaoling, Jinkou, Zhuting, Shiwan, Hengshan, Xialiushi, Tianerbu, Hengzhou, Dongyangdu, Guanyinqiao, Wa, Zheqiao, Leiyang, Xiaoshuipoo, Gongpingxu, Gaotingsi, Qifengdu, Xujiadong, Chenzhou, Chenshang, Dengjiatang, Taipingli, Baishidu, Pingshi, Luojiadu, Qimen, Lechang, Yangxi, Liputou, Hebianchang, Shaozhou, Maba, Wushi, Dakengkou, Shakou, Hetou, Yingde, Boluokeng, Lianjiangkou, Tan, Yingzui, Yinzhan, Juntian, Letong, Xinjie, Guotang, Jiangcun, Dalang, Xiaocun, Xicun, Huangsha, a total of ninety stations. Now, Xujiapeng is renamed Wuchang East Station, Tongxiangmen is renamed Wuchang Main Station, Chenzhou is renamed Chenxian Station, Hengzhou is renamed Hengyang Station, Shaozhou is renamed Qujiang Station, Xicun is renamed Guangzhou West Station, and Huangsha is renamed Guangzhou South Station. The products along the line are abundant, such as rice and minerals in Hunan, oil cakes, grains, tea, cowhide, homespun cloth, and eggs in Hubei, and food and seafood in Guangdong, which can be supplied to each other in the future. Taking Xiang rice as an example, if it can be sold in Guangdong, it can reach 2.4 million bags per year, which is enough to make up for the 10 million yuan annual leakage of Guangdong purchasing foreign rice, and Guangdong transporting and selling to Hunan can also regulate the people's food. Therefore, the opening of this road is of great significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. As for the scenic spots, there are too many to list. The mountains include the 72 peaks of Mount Heng, and the rivers include the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, Xiang River, Wu River, and North River. Yuezhou has Yueyang Tower and Little Qiao's Tomb, Miluo is where Qu Yuan drowned, Leiyang has Zhang's horse drinking trough, the location of the garrison, and the tomb of Du Fu. In Lechang, Han Yu of Changli once lived as an official, and the plaque "Kites fly and fish leap" that he personally inscribed is still majestic. Famous ministers, poets, and heroes have left their mark for thousands of years, which is enough for people to look up to and pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Escaped Prisoner Recaptured</h3>
<p>He Houren, a robbery convict from Dongtai detained in the county prison, was sentenced to eight years in prison. Recently, he was assigned to do outside labor carrying mud for house repairs. He took advantage of the guard's carelessness and escaped. By the time the guard realized it, he had disappeared without a trace. The matter was reported to the Public Security Bureau by the prison official, and orders were issued to investigate and arrest him. Eventually, he was spotted by a guard from the prison at the Mingxing Bridge Station. The prisoner fled, but was stopped and detained, and taken back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: County Magistrate Prays for Good Harvest</h3>
<p>In recent years, the county has suffered repeated disasters and poor autumn harvests. This year, the county's farmland has hopes for a good harvest of early rice, and the late rice also presents an optimistic outlook. The villagers have been celebrating the good harvest enthusiastically. County Magistrate Peng Baichuan specially prayed for a good harvest in the whole county at the Huazang Temple on Ma'an Mountain on the Zhongyuan Festival (30th). The ceremony was grand, and all the great lay Buddhists of the Lotus Society attended, which was quite a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Adjusting Disputes Between Landlords and Tenants</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Deng Xianghai, in order to adjust the disputes between landlords and tenants in Wu County, convened a meeting on the morning of the 1st with all parties concerned and representatives of the industry guilds to discuss together. In the afternoon of that day, the landlords exchanged opinions again at the Tianye Business Office. On the morning of the 2nd, a meeting was held again at the county government, chaired by County Magistrate Deng, to conduct a detailed study of important issues such as industry guild registration. As a result of the two-day consultation, agreements were reached on major issues such as disaster investigation, rent payment, discount, relief to farmers, disposition of land rent, industry guild registration, and rural relief. The county government will submit a report to the province for approval. The date for rent payment will be determined and announced by the county government and the county party headquarters. The industry guild bill will be changed to a notification bill. Rent collection shall not exceed 85% of the original rent. Disaster investigation shall be carried out when the rice is ripe but not harvested, and a disaster investigation committee shall be organized in each township. Industry guild registration shall be handled by the county government. Rent rice discount shall be determined by the county government and the county party headquarters based on the average price of Suzhou new coarse japonica rice from the date of early rice listing to the day after the first frost. All industry guilds must comply with it. As for cracking down on urging and collection, it will be temporarily suspended. The issue of paying salaries to urging officials was not studied because it concerned the county budget.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Vegetable Industry Opposes Excessive Taxes</h3>
<p>The local tax bureau of Changshu County recently resumed the collection of taxes on hotels, restaurants, and tea houses, prompting opposition from these businesses. On the evening of September 1st, an emergency meeting was convened, and the situation appeared quite serious, potentially leading to a market strike by these businesses. This area began levying taxes on hotels, restaurants, and tea houses in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) due to insufficient public security funds. The tax amount was determined by each establishment, with a total annual collection of 2,400 yuan. Initially, the monthly revenue was only over 30 yuan, barely enough to cover the living expenses of one tax collector, and due to the trivial nature of the matter, it was virtually abolished. This has continued for twenty-five months. Unexpectedly, the county government, noting the prolonged absence of this tax collection, reappointed Bian as the tax collector. Accompanied by bailiffs, he pursued the twenty-five months of arrears from the businesses. Those who resisted had their managers detained. Consequently, the businesses held an emergency meeting to petition the county party headquarters and the chamber of commerce, seeking justice and proposing two points:</p>
<p>To waive the arrears of the past twenty-five months.</p>
<p>To temporarily suspend collection pending a resolution from the provincial government. At that time, the chamber of commerce agreed to petition the provincial government on their behalf to strive for the abolition of the excessive taxes. Currently, these three industries are organizing a temporary consortium. If the county government insists on strict collection, they will respond by organizing a market strike and business closures.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Impersonating an Official to Defraud Money Leads to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Zhao, a resident of No. 105 Beidang in this county, possesses considerable wealth and has two sons. The elder son, Zhicheng, received higher education, while the younger son, Zhili, graduated from Nanjing Central University. However, Zhicheng did not engage in proper work and indulged in wandering. His father's attempts to discipline him were ineffective, leading to a newspaper announcement severing their father-son relationship. After leaving home, Zhicheng associated with hooligans, specializing in extortion. At the end of 1933, Zhao, dressed in military uniform and wearing a military belt, encountered Li Jianleng, a native of Dongyang County, Jinhua, Zhejiang, in Nanjing. Zhao claimed to be the district chief of the supervisory audit office in Jiangxi to Shanxi, stating that he could recommend Li as a battalion commander if he was interested, but a security deposit of 500 yuan was required. Li, believing this to be true, raised 500 silver dollars and gave them to Zhao Zhicheng, who then issued a letter of appointment. After receiving the letter, Li immediately returned to Shanghai to prepare for taking up the position in Jiangxi. However, the unit stated that they had not appointed Li as a battalion commander and that they had never heard of Zhao Zhicheng. Li was detained and sent to the Nanchang headquarters for strict handling. It was at this point that Li realized he had been deceived. After explaining the situation, Li was released from prison. Recently, Zhao also defrauded Zhang Jisheng of 1,000 yuan in legal tender in Hangzhou and fled to Wuxi.  After Li Jianleng found out about this, he went to Wuxi from Shanghai with his younger brother, Li Chao, and his wife, Gu Jingjun, and apprehended Zhao on the street. He was sent to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge and transferred to the General Bureau. Zhao directly admitted to impersonating an official to defraud money. Yesterday, he was transferred to the court, and after interrogation by the procurator, he was ordered to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Drug Trafficking Den Uncovered in Jinsha</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau uncovered a drug trafficking ring in Jiepai Town on the border of Jinsha Yanlu Township and seized morphine. Seven drug offenders, including Shan Hairu, were apprehended, and the witnesses were all sent to the Fourth District Security Command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>District Chief Pu Liu Assaulted</h3>
<p>Wei Huai, the district chief of Pu Liu in the Third District of Tongyi, went to stop a witch god gathering held by the villagers of Xifang Township late at night. He was surrounded by the villagers and beaten, sustaining injuries. He was rescued by the security team, and the county government apprehended the main instigators, Wu and Wu Jincheng, for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Township Head Flees to Evade Punishment</h3>
<p>Liu Hairu, the township head of Wenhua Township in the Second District of this county, previously harbored bandits and concealed bandit guns. The security team repeatedly searched for him without success. Subsequently, the district office requested and was approved by the county government to dismiss him, and Liu Daoli, the head of the fourth bao in the township, was recommended to replace him. However, after the bandit collusion case occurred, Liu Hairu fled with the official seal to evade punishment. This prevented the new township head from taking office. The district office has now requested the county government to issue a strict arrest warrant and reissue the township office seal to enable its use and ensure credibility.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Feng Yuxiang Gives Instructions in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Hangzhou from Nanchang at 8:00 AM on the 1st and went to Hai Ning to watch the tide at Ba.  He was entertained by the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government in the evening, and stayed at the China Bank Villa. Yesterday (the 2nd) at 8:00 AM, at the invitation of Acting Chairman Xu of the Provincial Government, he went to the auditorium of the Provincial Government to give instructions. Over 1,000 staff members from various departments and bureaus attended. Xu Qingfu gave an introductory speech, followed by Feng Yuxiang's instructions, which mainly covered two points:</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's implementation of the New Life Movement surpasses all other regions.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is more economical, cleaner, and more orderly than the Longhai Railway. At 9:00 AM, he visited the Jianqiao Aviation School, and returned to the city at 11:30 AM. He gave a speech to the youth at the lecture hall. At 12:30 PM, he went to the Wuxing Gospel Hospital to visit Old Mrs. Meng, and then went to Jiaxing Cheng Dian. A specially prepared train carried his secretary and guards, departing at 2:00 PM and arriving in Jiaxing at 3:00 PM. Feng then took a special train back to Nanjing, stopping briefly in Suzhou for sightseeing.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Armed Fight Over Fish Theft</h3>
<p>Kandun Town in Yuyao, about sixty li from the city, is adjacent to Shengshan and Baisha. On the afternoon of the 10th of last month, Yang Baorong and Yang Yaocan, villagers from Jiepai Tou, went to the Dihe Lake to steal fish raised by the Xu family. They were discovered by Xu Abing, Xu Huiren, and others, who gathered more than ten people, confiscated the fishing nets, and pushed the Yangs into the lake. The Yangs, unwilling to accept this, gathered more than twenty people to reason with them. However, Xu Abing and others learned of this and rang gongs to gather more than two hundred villagers, each armed with weapons, who rushed to Kandun and blocked the Yangs' path. A fight broke out, and villager Chen Zhaochang's lower abdomen was stabbed by Xu Huiren with a sharp blade, causing profuse bleeding and endangering his life. Fortunately, the local security corps arrived and suppressed the situation, and peace was restored.</p>
<h3>The Boundary Demarcation of Shengsi is Approaching</h3>
<p>The long-pending issue of the boundary demarcation of the Shengsi Islands has not yet been resolved after joint inspections by officials from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Last month, the Shanghai native place associations of Ningbo, Dinghai, and Fenghua, citing the Provincial and County Boundary Survey Regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan in 1930, and based on geography, submitted separate petitions to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior, requesting boundary demarcation according to the map and ordering the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to hand over the area as soon as possible, so that the long-pending case could be resolved soon. It is now known that the Executive Yuan, after receiving the petitions, has scheduled a boundary demarcation meeting in Nanjing on September 4th, and has telegraphed the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to inform them. After receiving the telegram, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has telegraphed Commissioner Zhao of the Yin District to represent them at the meeting in Nanjing. It is said that Zhao plans to travel to Nanjing via the province to attend the boundary demarcation meeting.</p>

However, the Jianghua steamer's attempt to tow the ship was ineffective. While a steamer was being dispatched for rescue, the Wheeldock tugboat dispatched by the Shanghai Bureau and the three barges prepared for unloading the cargo had not yet arrived at the Qingtian Reef at 2:00 AM yesterday. However, the tide had risen greatly (the 12th and 3rd were spring tides). At 2:06 AM, the water had risen by four English feet, and the combined water volume exceeded thirteen feet. The draft of the Jianguo after loading was only twelve feet six inches. At this time, the bow of the grounded ship had automatically floated up, and the damaged rudder screw had also been repaired. When the ship reached Huang Youshi, it did not wait for the Wheeldock tugboat to arrive and did not need to unload the cargo. It was able to get off the shoal. It urgently reversed the engine and left the shoal on its own, returning to Shanghai. It entered the port at about 9:00 AM. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the shipowner Huang reported the process to the Bureau. The Bureau sent an engineer to inspect the ship and then unloaded the cargo. It will enter the factory for repairs today.</p>

<h3>Mu Xiangyue Bitterly Discusses the New Special Goods Tax; Sends Telegrams to Nanjing and Hebei Authorities</h3>
<p>Mu Xiangyue telegraphed to Nanjing and Hebei authorities yesterday, saying, "To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: A telegram was recently sent to Chairman Song Zheyuan of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council in Beiping, which reads, 'To Chairman Song Mingxuan of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council and all members: Reports indicate that your council will impose a new tax on special goods transported into Hebei-Chahar, equivalent to one-eighth of the national customs duty, which is deeply concerning and confusing. This move is equivalent to transforming what was previously considered smuggled goods by the customs into legitimate imports, which can be freely transported within the country without any obstacles. This is tantamount to undermining the uniformity of customs administration, destroying the revival of domestic industry, suppressing the development of the national economy, and disrupting the national fiscal budget. The economic aggression is more brutal than military force. Your Excellency supports the precarious situation with painstaking efforts, and your patriotic sincerity is admired by all. A man of your wisdom would not do this. However, if this is implemented, the lifeline of the country and the livelihood of the people will be completely ruined. Please do your best to mediate and abolish this measure to leave a glimmer of hope for the national economy. I had the pleasure of meeting you once, and I cannot bear to see your reputation tarnished. I have taken the liberty of making these remarks, and I hope you will reply. Mu Xiangyue, seal,' etc. Please review and approve this and immediately stop it. The country will be very fortunate. Mu Xiangyue, seal.'"</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui Telegraphed Back to Anhui Natives in Shanghai: Troops Dispatched to Wipe Out Communist Bandits in Wuyuan</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Anhui Wuyuan bandits have not yet been pacified. Fellow villagers of the county living in Shanghai recently sent a telegram to Zhang Fakui, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui, represented by Zai Xiaoya, requesting him to send troops to wipe them out. Yesterday, they received a telegram from Mr. Zhang, stating that he has ordered the *师 to advance from Quzhou towards Wuyuan. The two telegrams are recorded below: (1) Wang Xiaoya's telegram to Zhang Fakui reads, "To Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xianghua: My county, Wuyuan, is located on the border of Jiangxi and Zhejiang, bordering Kaihua, and south of Deyu. For the past three or four years, it has been occupied by Communist bandits who have been committing arson, murder, looting, and all sorts of atrocities in the countryside, causing the good people to be alarmed and unable to sleep peacefully. Since the deployment of a part of Commander Bao's troops, the ferocity of the bandits has been slightly curbed. Recently, the neighboring garrison was transferred, and they have once again taken the opportunity to stir up trouble, breaking into homes and robbing families, leaving nothing behind. What have our people done to deserve such suffering? The autumn harvest is approaching, and the people's food supply is at stake. If the harvest cannot be reaped, the weak will die in the ditches, and the strong will become Communist bandits. If one village is like this, other villages will follow. If one county is like this, other counties will follow. A spark can start a prairie fire. Is that not frightening? Prolonged warfare will also make our people suffer. I, Xiaoya, grew up in this village and have seen and heard more about this. The current bandits are mostly a rabble that cannot withstand a single blow. Only a brigade of troops is needed to attack from Kaihua, Deyu, and the eastern villages of Wuyuan to encircle them on three sides, and it would not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Your Excellency commands the troops and creates blessings for the people of the four provinces. Our county is also under your care. Because I have been living away from home for a long time, I cannot fully perform the duties of a host, and I feel very sorry. Now, I humbly represent the people of my county to plead for help, to quickly send elite troops to wipe out the Communist bandits and save the masses from this deep pit of suffering. The merit of this will be boundless. Respectfully wishing you a quick victory, Wang Xiaoya kowtows." (2) Mr. Zhang's reply telegram reads, "To Mr. Wang Xiaoya: Your telegram of the other day, informing me of the bandit disturbances in Wuyuan, has been received. The *师 is currently advancing from Quzhou towards Wuyuan. I have ordered them to quickly deploy and actively suppress the bandits. A special reply, Zhang Fakui's stamp."</p>

<h3>Bloodshed Erupts During Shanghai Municipal Council's Demolition of Shantytowns in Eastern Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Over Forty Shantytown Residents, Men and Women, Injured; Over Thirty People Arrested, Three Detectives Also Injured; United Association Holds Emergency Meeting, Demanding Release and Punishment of Culprits</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council sent detectives yesterday morning to forcibly demolish shantytowns in eastern Shanghai, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Over forty shantytown residents, men and women, were injured. On the detective side, one Western detective and two Indian detectives were also injured. After the incident, representatives were selected from the area to petition the Chinese directors of the Ratepayers' Association, the First Special District Citizens' United Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Council. At 4:00 PM, the Shanghai Shantytown United Association held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures, resolving to demand the immediate release of the arrested poor people and to punish the culprits and provide compensation. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Incident Circumstances</p>
<p>The incident was triggered by Shantytown No. 448 in the area. Due to the age and decay of the shacks, they were no longer habitable, and residents planned to repair them. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council intervened and stopped the repairs. Despite repeated requests for leniency from the shantytown residents, they were unsuccessful. At 9:15 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a large number of detectives and laborers to order the demolition. The shantytown residents, feeling a sense of shared fate, rushed to request leniency. However, a misunderstanding occurred at this moment. Batons flew, and many people fell to the ground injured. The shantytown women also fought back with chamber pots and washbasins, throwing excrement and other objects into the air, resulting in yellow and white substances splattered everywhere, and the stench was unbearable. Many shantytown residents were injured, and many were arrested on the spot and temporarily detained at the Yangshupu Police Station. According to subsequent investigations, over thirty people were arrested.</p>
<p>Separate Petitions</p>
<p>Feeling that the incident was unexpected and a complete disaster, the shantytown residents selected Ji Yunsheng, Tang Anping, Xu Xiguang, Duan Yifu, Zhang Buyun, Ruan Bukuan, Chen Qingde, Wang Daoyi, Zhu Yushu, and others to petition separately. They first went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association on Hong Kong Road. After submitting their petition, the person in charge of the association inquired in detail about the incident and promised to find a way to negotiate. They then went to the First Special District Citizens' United Association at Tianhougong Bridge. Hu Fengxiang and Cao Zhigong, the executive members of the association, received them and also promised to provide assistance. The representatives left the Citizens' United Association at nearly 4:30 PM and went to the Shanghai Municipal Council again to demand the release of the arrested individuals.</p>
<p>Injury Investigation</p>
<p>Among the shantytown residents, over ten people were injured, including Gu Baotian, Gu Naiming, Sun Hankui, Pan Youji, Liu Yuming, Kuai Jiayan, Old Man Sun, Old Man Gao, Old Man Yang, and Mrs. Le, the mother of Jiang Beiyu. Over twenty people, including Zhou Xiaowu, sustained minor injuries. On the detective side, one Western detective and two Indian detectives were also injured. Currently, most of the injured shantytown residents have been arrested and are in the police station, while the remaining are moaning in their shacks, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The All-City Shantytown United Association held an emergency meeting of all executive committee members at its headquarters at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures for the case. Chairman Tang Anping resolved the following: How to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council for forcibly demolishing the shacks of poor people and wantonly harming the working masses? Resolution: A. Send another letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council for serious negotiations. B. Send another letter to the Ratepayers' Association and the Citizens' Association, advocating for the protection of workers' lives and arguing based on reason. The association had previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council proposing a gradual reduction in shacks and improvements in education and sanitation. Before receiving a reply, they recklessly acted, sending a large number of Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives and laborers to forcibly demolish the shacks on Chaoyang Road and indiscriminately injure civilians. How to negotiate this case? Resolution: A. Submit a serious negotiation to the Shanghai Municipal Council to stop the demolition. B. Detectives who have neglected their duties should be punished. C. Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. D. Release the detained civilians within 24 hours. E. The Shanghai Municipal Council should be responsible for medical expenses and compensation for losses for the injured. F. Send letters to all sectors of society, upholding justice and requesting unanimous assistance. How to provide relief to the families of the shantytown residents who were beaten and injured? Resolution: A. Send representatives to express condolences. Tang Anping, Ji Yunsheng, and Xu Xiguang are responsible. B. The association will temporarily provide subsidies as appropriate.</p>
<h3>County Local Association Discusses Land Prices Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County's conversion of land tax to land value tax has been decided to be implemented this year. However, the County Local Association believed that the Land Bureau's assessment of farmland prices was too high and had repeatedly requested the provincial and county governments to reassess them, but without success. Therefore, the association held a meeting at the Beiqiao County Property Office at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over ten people, including Wang Chengyao, Zhang Jingye, and Wu Shifang, attended, with Chairman Qin Xitian presiding. After discussion, the attendees generally agreed that the land value tax in Jiangsu Province was only being piloted in Shanghai and Nanhui counties. Now that Nanhui has been delayed due to various reasons, and given the situation in this county, which affects the burden on the people of the entire county, it should also be delayed in order to reassess the land prices. Therefore, it was publicly resolved to submit a report to the provincial government's Land Bureau, requesting permission to delay the implementation in order to alleviate the people's hardship. At 2:00 PM, County Land Bureau Director Jin Yanze was invited to the meeting for discussions.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, Directors Accuse Secretary General</h3>
<p>Cang Gongwen, Zhu Fengxiang, and other directors of the Shanghai Special District Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association recently hired lawyer Yang Qianmao to file a lawsuit with the criminal court of the district court, accusing the secretary-general of the association, Zhang Dengying, of distributing leaflets and publicly defaming them. After receiving the lawsuit, the court heard the case in the criminal court three at 3:20 PM yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Yu Lude. The plaintiffs, Cang Gongwen and Zhu Fengxiang, stated that the plaintiffs were elected as directors by over 40,000 rickshaw pullers and were faithfully performing their duties to seek the welfare of the rickshaw pullers, which aroused resentment. Zhang Dengying, the secretary-general hired by the association, lived a comfortable life and dared to control the association's affairs and monopolize everything. Although the membership fees collected amounted to over 400,000 yuan, the association has now been completely depleted. He arbitrarily made expenditures and gave arbitrary orders. The accounts were not made public, so the plaintiffs, entrusted by over 40,000 rickshaw pullers, did not dare to collude with him and damage their personal integrity. Therefore, they advocated investigating the defendant's actions and announced it publicly. The defendant, seeing that the plaintiffs were preventing his greed and investigating his embezzlement, developed dissenting intentions and printed a large number of leaflets to arbitrarily damage the reputations of the plaintiffs. Therefore, they requested legal action. The witness, Qin Buwang, testified that on the 15th of last month, he was ordered by Mr. Yang of the West District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers to deliver white leaflets to the children's school of the Zhabei Rickshaw Branch, and he did not know anything else. At this point, Zhang Dengying stated that he has always been diligent in his duties at the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association and has not engaged in any improper behavior. The distribution of leaflets by others targeting the plaintiffs was not done by him, and he is now being framed. The judge stated that the case still needs to be investigated and further investigated and dealt with.</p>
<h3>Chinese Taoist Association Begins Operations Today</h3>
<p>After all members of the Chinese Taoist Association took their oaths of office, they reported to the authorities for approval and filing. Now the internal organization is gradually improving, the seal is in use, and operations have begun. Yesterday, they published a notice in the newspaper to various Taoist temples and Taoist followers of all factions, encouraging them to join the association in order to maintain it. It is heard that the association has received many letters from various provinces and cities requesting the articles of association and applying to establish branches. Shandong Yue Temple, Baoshan Chonghe Temple, Shanghai Great King Temple Qingxu Temple, and Great Boundary Guandi Temple have all joined as group members as a priority. There are also Taoist believers, Chinese merchants Hong Tai'an and others, residing in the Philippines and various islands in Southeast Asia, who have also joined the association. The executive committee of the association, recognizing that people's hearts are treacherous in modern times and the true Tao has been lost, with many ignorant people using the name of Taoism to treat diseases with evil arts, collect money with talismans, and deceive ignorant people with meaningless superstitions, which not only damages the reputation of Taoism but also violates national laws, has instructed the member group to strictly review the received applications for membership and to refuse membership to those with unclear origins or suspicious points. This is the first step in rectifying Taoism.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor Zhao Transferred from the Third Branch of the High Court</h3>
<p>Zhao Shibei, the chief prosecutor of the Procuratorate of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, has been ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to be transferred to the position of president of a local court in Guangdong. A group photo of the entire staff of the High Court and President Zhao was taken the other day to commemorate the occasion. It is understood that during his tenure, Yuan Fuzhen, a resident of Baker Road, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, suing Zhao for failing to honor a guarantee debt of 2,000 yuan, which is said to be a mortgage payment. After receiving the complaint, the court has issued a summons and ordered both parties to appear for trial in Civil Court Seven at 9:00 AM on the 4th (tomorrow), presided over by Judge Li Liang.</p>
<h3>Zhou Mengyun Promotes Vocational Abacus, Currently Planning to Establish a School to Teach</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Zhou Mengyun, the inventor of the telescopic abacus, has attracted much attention from the public since he publicly exhibited and lectured at the People's Education Center of the Confucian Temple in the South City at the beginning of last month. Letters requesting his new book "New Theory on Abacus" have been received almost every day, totaling over 5,000 copies. According to Mr. Zhou, who spoke to a reporter from the National News Agency, most of the citizens who have requested the new theory on abacus are residents of Ward Road in Hongkou and the Xinza District. Therefore, he plans to establish abacus night schools in these areas after the autumn weather cools down to create more talent. Moreover, most of those who love the abacus are citizens of the middle and lower classes, so he strives to keep the tuition fees low. His intention is to serve the community, not to make a profit. In addition, his "Practical Vocational Abacus," which he has compiled, has already been sent to the printer and is expected to be published by the end of this month. In the future, he intends to use it as the teaching material for the night school.</p>
<h3>Continued Registration of Omitted Opium Smokers Extended to the 10th of This Month; Those Who Fail to Report Will Be Subject to Military Law</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the opium suppression affairs in this city are being handled by the general association sending the special investigation commissioner Ma Liang to supervise the city's Public Security Bureau to handle registration and investigation matters. Since the beginning of the operation, various opium suppression publicity matters have been carried out in a passive manner, and house-to-house inspections have been carried out in an active manner. Therefore, the registration of opium smokers has been quite effective. However, due to the mixed residence of five parties in this city and the large number of mobile households, the government authorities have specially extended the deadline to the 10th of this month for the sake of caution, giving opium smokers a final opportunity to reform themselves and to avoid any omissions. For this purpose, the city Public Security Bureau has formulated a guarantee form and distributed it to each branch bureau in the city to distribute it to households and report it truthfully. If there are opium smokers who have not yet registered, they are advised to go through the registration procedures as soon as possible. Those who fail to report will be subject to military law. Therefore, there are still quite a few unregistered opium smokers in the city who come and go to register these days. It is expected that great results will be achieved during this extended period of ten days.</p>

<h3>Interception at the Intersection of Route Paul Henry · Seven Sacks of Narcotics Seized · Weighing Three Hundred and Forty-Four Pounds · Car Driver Chen Huqiu of Tongzhou Arrested</h3>
<p>At No. 23 Daqing Lane, Yunnan Road, someone had established the Tongxing Company to supply and manufacture raw materials for the narcotic pill "Red Pill." The transportation of goods was highly secretive. At 9:10 AM the previous morning, Chen Huqiu, a car driver from Tongzhou, was hired to transport seven sacks of powdered sugar, saccharin, and coffee essence, weighing three hundred and forty-four pounds. He was traveling along Route Paul Henry, intending to deliver them to a certain organization in Caojiadu, when he was intercepted by Chinese detectives Liu Junjie and Liu Shuxun, etc., from the Avenue Haig police station, who found his behavior suspicious. They immediately stopped him and questioned him, learning the whole story. They then rushed to the company, where they apprehended Liu Xingfu, a native of Ningbo. The main culprit escaped during the chaos. In the rear wing, they found a large quantity of raw materials: powdered white, 148 pounds plus 88 pounds, including the barrels; charcoal, 43 pounds including the barrel; one package of Angelica dahurica root, weighing half a pound; cinchona salt powder, weighing seven pounds including the can; resin, weighing twenty-three pounds including the can; coffee essence, weighing five pounds including the can; one package of white resin, weighing half a pound; and seven account books. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department explained the situation and requested a postponement to analyze the aforementioned materials. Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the arrest, and the raw materials for the narcotic pill "Red Pill" were presented for inspection. The car driver Chen Huqiu testified that a stranger near the company on Second Avenue hired him to transport the seven sacks of materials to Caojiadu. The stranger escaped during the arrest, and he knew nothing else, pleading for leniency. Liu Xingfu testified that the company was established on February 2nd of this year and that a customer surnamed Zhou came to purchase something that was not raw materials for the "Red Pill." He also hired Attorney Eson to defend him. Judge Zhong Qing ordered that they remain in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Cables Zhenhai County, Thoroughly Investigating the Case of Unwarranted Detention of the Town Head</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Native Association, learned that the town head of Daqi in Zhenhai was arbitrarily detained by the local Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he specifically sent a telegram to the Zhenhai County Magistrate requesting a thorough investigation. The text of the telegram reads: "Respectfully addressed to Zhang, County Magistrate of the Zhenhai County Government: It has come to our attention that Xu Yunqin, the town head of Gaotang Town in the Fifth District of Zhenhai, together with He Xiangsheng, the head of Wanghe Township; Yu Heyu, the head of Beima Township; Gu Chunian, the head of Yongfeng Township; Wang Xitang, the head of Yan Yi Township; Le Wuchen, the head of Yan Er Township; Yu Kunfeng, the head of Henghe Township; Wang Fucheng, the head of Bei Xin Township; Yu Baoxing, the head of Shiqiu Township; and citizens Lin Guoyu, Gu Weikui, Wang Yuxiong, and others, have jointly telegraphed, stating that Yu Meitang, the town head of Daqi Town in their district and concurrently the captain of the Second County Security Brigade, was summoned by the police of the Daqi Public Security Bureau, directed by Chief Lin Guangyuan, on the 16th night. The following day, he was sent to the Ningxian District Security Command and detained. More than three days have passed, and the truth remains unclear. We have repeatedly telegraphed the county government for legal relief, but have received orders that the matter was previously unknown. Now, Town Head Yu has been released on bail by the Command after interrogation on the 20th. It is said that the Public Security Bureau Chief flattered party members and acted recklessly. When the summons was issued, no official document was presented; instead, they claimed the case was serious and immediately imposed martial law, prohibiting telegrams. Ten policemen, escorted by party member Zhao Xun and a 'Committee Member Yang' from the provincial party headquarters (self-proclaimed), arbitrarily directed the escort, handing him over at Kongshuling to armed soldiers of some unknown organization in the middle of the night, who then transferred him to Zhao Xun's residence in Jiangnan Doutou for detention. At the same time, Gu Fugui and He Yinning, who were arrested with him, were subjected to coercive interrogation with rattan canes at the Jiangfu police station and then sent to the county party headquarters before being transferred to the Ningxian District Security Command for detention. After interrogation, it was learned that the case involved Gu Yousheng's opium case in the town. The Baozhang (local neighborhood watch) was not satisfied with the punishment and fabricated accusations that the town head had taken bribes and let him go. Since town heads are civil servants under the leadership and supervision of party and government organs, any suspicion of crime or denouncement should be handled by their direct superiors or transferred to the judiciary. We have never heard of party members being able to arrest them directly, let alone conduct court trials, custodial detentions in private residences, or transfer them beyond the local government's judicial organs to party headquarters in neighboring counties for detention. Furthermore, the Public Security Bureau is an organ directly under the county government. Except in cases of violating police regulations, the arrest of criminals must be reported to the county government. When Town Head Yu was summoned to the bureau this time, the claim was that the case was too serious to be announced. How could he then be handed over to party members with no subordinate relationship for private removal? The intentions behind this are deeply suspicious. Under the clear blue sky, those who administer local self-government are being subjected to such illegal and oppressive treatment. How can the small, remote people be protected in the future? Town heads and others are implementing self-government and obeying administrative orders. If they are accused of wrongdoing, they will all take Yu Town Head's case as a lesson and be in constant fear for their safety. If we tolerate this without intervention, how will human rights be maintained in the future? In addition to continuing to telegram the county government requesting a thorough investigation, we hereby earnestly request the Guild to investigate by telegram and swiftly provide assistance, separately requesting the provincial and county party and government organs to conduct a thorough investigation and provide clear instructions to resolve the suspicions of the people." It is noted that the town head and citizens previously telegraphed us, requesting assistance. After our association telegraphed the Post County Security Command on the [day omitted]th, requesting that they quickly investigate and release him, we received telegram No. 131 from the Inspection Office, stating: "To the Shanghai Ningbo Association: I have received your telegram. Yu Meitang, the town head of Daqi Town in Zhenhai, was sent to this command by the Zhenhai County Party Headquarters for interrogation regarding the case of bribing opium offender Gu Fugui. After interrogation, he was released on bail. The Zhenhai County Magistrate was ordered to investigate the details of the case and report back for verification. This is to inform you for reference." Our association believes that town heads are civil servants. If there is indeed suspicion of crime, and they are reported or denounced, the proper procedure would be for their direct superiors to detain and transfer them to judicial or military courts for interrogation. However, the handling of this case, as described in the telegram—direct arrest, custodial detention in private residences, coercive interrogation, etc.—if true, appears to be an abuse of power. Based on the foregoing, we hereby urgently telegram Your Honor, the County Magistrate, requesting a thorough investigation and correction to uphold the law and dispel the suspicions of the people. We earnestly hope and pray for this." Signed, Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Native Association.</p>

<h3>China National Goods Company to Open Tomorrow, Inviting Hu Die and Others to Perform the Unveiling Ceremony</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the China National Goods Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shilu Road, which has been widely publicized, has completed its internal arrangements since its preparation. The shareholders' meeting resolved to formally open tomorrow and sent letters to film stars Hu Die, Chen Yumei, Wang Renmei, etc., inviting them to perform the unveiling ceremony. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Founding Purpose</p>
<p>The founders of this company are well-known national goods industrialists Zhou Zhaolin, Zhou Jingnai, etc. Recognizing that the international situation is turbulent, and China's commercial, agricultural, and economic sectors are in complete bankruptcy, promoting national goods to prevent leakage and thereby save what is already in a state of collapse is imperative. Therefore, they gathered capital of 200,000 yuan and surveyed the most prosperous location in the city, the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shilu Road, to establish this great national goods company.</p>
<p>Opening Tomorrow</p>
<p>All the internal equipment of the company has been designed and styled by famous artists, being both simple and beautiful. It can be described with the three words: "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty," and is indeed worthy of that praise. It is scheduled to open tomorrow. In addition to sending invitations to Hu Die, Chen Yumei, Wang Renmei, etc., to perform the unveiling ceremony, the goods in each department will also be specially discounted for one day to thank customers who support national goods. Departments such as silk fabrics, leather shoes, knitted shirts, cotton fabrics, and felt hats will have special and surprisingly discounted items. Therefore, it is predicted that at the opening of the company, the traffic on Nanjing Road will be heavy, and the road will be congested, as can be expected.</p>
<h3>The Child Laborers Dismissed by Customs Invited the Press Yesterday, Hoping Customs Will Reverse Its Decision, or Else Issue Retirement Compensation</h3>
<p>The child laborers in the Jianghai Customs export section, after six of them were dismissed by the authorities a few days ago, have been in a state of panic. They have united and requested that the authorities reverse their decision and reinstate them. Furthermore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, they invited the press to the New World Hotel (originally intending to use the Customs Staff Club in Xiangkang Lane on Route Paul Henry, but it was rejected, so they temporarily changed to the New World Hotel) to report on the situation. They stated that the Jianghai Customs child laborers were hired three years ago, with a monthly living allowance of sixteen yuan. When they joined the customs, there was no stipulation regarding a three-year term. Recently, the Jianghai Customs authorities have used the excuse of three years having expired and have decided to dismiss the first batch of 28 child laborers and recruit new laborers. This has caused a reaction from all the old child laborers. To maintain their livelihoods, they request strong assistance from all sectors and demand that the Customs authorities continue to employ them. Otherwise, they request that the authorities give them six months' retirement compensation to prepare for finding work to survive during the transition.</p>

<h3>Tragedy of Fatal Accident Involving a Municipal Bus · One Person Killed on the Spot, One Woman Seriously Injured · Three Others Also Struck, but Injuries Are Minor</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday, the No. 10013 repair vehicle of the Municipal Bus Management Office of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, driven by Li Denghai (age 19, driver's license No. 1493) from Shandong, was traveling south to north when it reached the entrance of Chongqing Lane, No. 372 Fangxie Road, in the Nanshi district. A rickshaw was pulling a passenger in front. Because the road was curved and the car was traveling at a relatively high speed, the driver, upon seeing it, immediately braked. He braked too hard, causing the brake lever to break, making it impossible to control the vehicle. The car then hit and overturned the rickshaw. A female passenger from Suzhou, Tang Bo, 28 years old, who had come to Shanghai from her hometown to visit relatives, suffered injuries to her head and legs and lost consciousness. After the Western District Fire Brigade received the news, they immediately dispatched an ambulance to take her to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, where her life is in danger. The rickshaw driver, feeling guilty, ran away without a trace. At the same time, Jin Puhe, a 30-year-old Huangyan native who lived at No. 13-14 Tai'an Street, Fangxie Road, and worked as a machine-knitting wool craftsman, was passing by on the sidewalk when he was also struck in the head. He died immediately due to the severity of his injuries. He left behind elderly parents, a frail wife, and young children, all in his hometown. The deceased was living in Shanghai with his uncle, Mingfa, who was also in the machine-knitting wool clothing business. They have reported the case to the bureau and are awaiting the inspection of the body by the local court today, requesting legal action. There were three others with minor injuries: Wu Zhiqing, the young owner of the Yanlingtang Traditional Chinese Medicine store at No. 367 Fangxie Road, who was sitting nearby enjoying the cool air, suffered an injury to his left arm, and his stool was also crushed; Zhang Fulin, a resident of No. 361 on the same road, suffered injuries to his hands and feet; and Zhang Fuchang, a 13-year-old boy from No. 13, Chongqing Lane, Manufacturing Bureau Road, suffered a head injury. They were also taken by ambulance to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and returned home after bandaging.</p>
<h3>Dancer Accuses Man of Rape · Age Awaiting Investigation · Difficult to Determine if She Is Fifteen or Sixteen · Witnesses from Dance Halls Unable to Give Definite Testimony</h3>
<p>Chen Xinyuan (also known as Yingquan), a Cantonese graduate of Fudan University, was recently accused by Pan Qinpu, the father of Metropolitan dance hostess Zhang Peifang (originally named Pan An'nan), to the Old Zha Police Station for raping his daughter. After the police charged the accused under Article 227, Clause 1 of the criminal law to the First Special Court, the plaintiff Pan Qinpu argued his daughter was not yet fifteen years old, while Chen argued that she had exceeded sixteen years of age. This matter, relating to the establishment of culpability, is significantly relevant, and so after the judges’ discussion it was decided to postpone the hearing and for Chen to post</p>
<p>3000 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>and be released, all matters recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of this court conducted a follow up hearing on this case. Chen Xinyuan also arrived with lawyer Yang Ruiji to the court. The two managers of the Metropolitan and Good Friends dance halls whom were summoned, did not arrive to the court, Metropolitan dispatched Zhang Dajin, Good Friends dispatched Xue Ou’gen, to the court to respond to questions. After lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police station clearly laid out the case’s proceeding, the court immediately called Pan Qinpu to the docket, saying you have previously filed with this court, a request to withdraw the charge, but this matter cannot be withdrawn, and proceeded to question Zhang Dajin of Metropolitan, regarding what Pan A’nan</p>
<p>reported her age</p>
<p>to be when she accompanied dances at Metropolitan. He responded that, according to Municipal Council regulations, any girl not yet fifteen years old, could not be hired to be a dance hostess, and when Pan A’nan entered Metropolitan, she reported her age to be sixteen years old, but there was no official record, only that they made a report each month to the police station. Xue Fugen of Good Friends then stated that Pan A’nan came to the Good Friends to accompany dances during tea dances around April 10th, but did not work the night shift. At the time Pan did not</p>
<p>report her age</p>
<p>and I did not ask, the court then called Pan A’nan to the stand and questioned whether she had reported her age at Metropolitan or Good Friends, to which she replied that she had not reported at Good Friends, but had reported she was sixteen years old at Metropolitan, she was also asked whether she had read any books, to which she replied that when she was nine years old she studied for two years at the Southeast Elementary School near Taiping Bridge in the French Concession, but the school was now closed, when asked what her actual age was, she replied “Middle five,” born on September 17th, she was asked whether she had ever spoke about her age to Chen Xinyuan, to which she responded that she had done so amidst conversation, and that Chen had also said he was thirty years old, born in October, she was asked whether Chen Xinyuan had ever said to her that last year she had accompanied dances at</p>
<p>the Xinhua Dance Hall</p>
<p>to which she responded, no. Judge Feng then turned to question Chen Xinyuan, asking whether his birthday was in October, to which he replied that indeed it was October 17th, but that he was 31 years old, and that he had never stated it before, and that Pan had probably discovered this elsewhere. Lawyer Yang Ruinian immediately requested to question Pan on whether she had ever joined a dance school, and the court followed and questioned Pan, who answered that, in the second half of last year at</p>
<p>the Social Dance School</p>
<p>in Huile Lane, she had studied dance for a month, and her reported age was 14. Lawyer Yang stated that the question of age was extremely important, and according to what Metropolitan’s representative had said, if Pan was not yet sixteen, the dance hall should not have hired her in the first place, or at least Pan should be seventeen, so he was requesting a full investigation, Judge Feng agreed and stated to postpone a week to investigate and examine again.</p>
<h3>Tongde Hospital Holds Lung X-ray Examinations, Many Requesting Examination</h3>
<p>The Tongde Hospital in Tongfu Road, recognizing that lung diseases are hidden internally and are difficult to diagnose, with dangers multiplied if medical treatment is delayed, truly are the strong enemy of humankind's health.

Therefore, they requested that the Second District Security Command's claim be rectified, so that they may be provided with a remedy. Chief Sun Ke considered the reasoning to be proper, and agreed to relay this to the commander to find a way to remedy this situation.</p>
<h3>Tianchan Tea House Closes, a Reaction to the Recession</h3>
<p>Tea houses are where people from the industrial and commercial sectors gather, and many deals are completed in them. A few years ago, when the recession had not yet struck the major cities, the tea house industry was thriving. The Tianchan on Xizang Road, the Weile on Fourth Road, and the Yaochungge on Zhejiang Road were the most prosperous of the three tea houses. However, in recent years, with the extreme contraction of industry and commerce, all tea houses have felt unable to maintain operations. The Tianchan Tea House on Xizang Road has recently closed down. The operations of tea houses such as the Yaochungge are also very dismal. This is truly a reflection of the recession in all industries in this city.</p>

Feng Zhongfang, the owner of the Renchangtai Metal Shop at No. 376 Waitan Road, Wuxi, had used three promissory notes from the shop, totaling 1,300 yuan, to exchange for cash on the 7th of last month, thanks to the mediator Huang Zhensheng. Zhu Xiangxian also paid with two promissory notes totaling 900 yuan on the 15th of last month. Feng also had dealings with the shop, which owed Feng 624.7 yuan. After the shop collapsed, Feng discovered that the shop's capital, although claimed to be 10,000 yuan, was actually only 1,500 yuan. This amount was deposited in the China Industrial Bank, where Huang Zhensheng was employed. According to common practice, all the capital of a money shop should be deposited with the mediator, who then hands it over to the manager after the shop opens. Now, the shop's capital was nominally 10,000 yuan, but only 1,500 yuan was deposited with the mediator, which is clearly a joint fraud. Therefore, he hired lawyer Hu Yong to file a lawsuit against Zhao Liting, Li Yixiao, Zhu Xiangxian, Huang Zhensheng, and shareholder Shi Yunliang, requesting that they be charged with the crime of obtaining property by fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. The First Special District Court accepted the case and opened the Fifth Criminal Court for a hearing yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Chuan Lin. Only Huang Zhensheng appeared in court, as the others could not be found. Huang stated that the full 10,000 yuan in capital had been paid at the time, and that he did not recognize the shareholders. Judge Chuan stated that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>After Feng Maotang's Death, Family Fights Over Inheritance: Married Daughter Accuses Eldest Brother of Embezzlement, Citing Suspicious Witnessed Events</h3>
<p>Feng Maotang from Wuxi made his fortune in real estate and silk. He accumulated considerable wealth and had three sons and one daughter: eldest son Xijun (also known as Shaojiang, currently works as a compradore in the silk department of Jardine Matheson, residing at 9 Wende Lane, Seymour Road), Xigeng, youngest son Xiliang, and daughter Wenjuan (32 years old, long married, residing at 5 Wende Lane, Seymour Road). Maotang suddenly fell ill in May of this year and passed away on June 16th, more than two months ago.</p>
<p>Corpse Not Yet Cold</p>
<p>Disputes have already arisen within the family. Feng Wenjuan hired lawyer Gu Yongquan to file a complaint in the First District Court, Criminal Division, accusing her eldest brother, Feng Xijun, of embezzling inheritance money and other matters. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin presided over a hearing in the Fifth Court. The defendant, Feng Xijun, arrived with his lawyer, Xu Shihao, to respond to the charges. Lawyer Gu Yongquan, representing the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff, Jiang Wenjuan, is currently ill and receiving treatment in room 208 of the Sino-German Hospital, and therefore</p>
<p>Unable to Attend Court</p>
<p>Gu lawyer then presented the main points of the lawsuit on her behalf, stating that after Feng Wenjuan's father, Maotang, fell ill on May 1st, all account books, bank passbooks, deposit slips, and seals were seized by the defendant. After Maotang passed away on June 16th, the defendant neither handed over the passbooks and cash nor reported the accounts. At the time, the plaintiff believed that her eldest brother was in a state of grief and had no time for these matters, so she did not press him. However, the defendant heard</p>
<p>Whispers of Gossip</p>
<p>Knowing that it would be difficult to delay further, on July 7th, he personally created a floating account, claiming to establish a contract for the analysis and management of family property. The plaintiff, trusting that her brother would not deceive her, signed without questioning the accuracy of the listed amounts. Currently, the father's concubine, Madam Mei, is demanding an audit due to the defendant's seizure of family property and failure to distribute it fairly, and has applied to the Civil Division of the court for preservation of evidence. The defendant, feeling guilty, without the consent of his younger siblings, hastily</p>
<p>Reached a Settlement with Madam Mei</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on August 20th, the plaintiff and her mother went to the defendant's office in the silk department of Jardine Matheson and saw the accountant he employed holding a passbook for an account at the Bank of Communications, looking quite uneasy. The mother, recognizing it as family property, asked what it was. The accountant replied that it was being handed over to Mr. Xijun. The mother immediately took it and, upon inspection, discovered that the defendant had, while Maotang was seriously ill, withdrawn funds from the passbook, amounting to a substantial 63,000 yuan, from May 21st to June 2nd. The investigation revealed that this money was not only</p>
<p>Distributed According to Law</p>
<p>But was not mentioned at all in the family property distribution contract, which is very confusing. The plaintiff believes his actions violate Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and therefore has filed a lawsuit. Next, the defendant's defense lawyer, Xu Shihao, stated that the plaintiff's accusations are untrue. The passbook was used for silkworm cocoon money, which was later</p>
<p>Returned as Old Debts</p>
<p>Therefore, all the money in the passbook was settled clearly on July 7th during the family property distribution. If there were any outstanding funds, then the defendant's two brothers would certainly have come forward to claim them. This point can be investigated with the Bank of Communications. The court ordered the case to be rescheduled in seven days, and instructed the plaintiff to appear in court again for verification.</p>
<h3>Road Association Promotes Manufacturing of Tires and Exploration for Gasoline</h3>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association yesterday formulated a plan to promote the manufacturing of automobile tires and the exploration for gasoline. The standing committee resolved to actively carry it out, and has already sent letters to relevant agencies, organizations, and automobile companies to discuss everything. This move is of great importance to the future of the national transportation industry. The original document is recorded as follows: China National Road Construction Association's Plan to Promote the Manufacture of Automobile Tires and Exploration for Gasoline. (In the summer of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the chairman of this association, Dr. Wang Rutang, deeply felt the inconvenience of domestic transportation, making it difficult for various undertakings to develop. He invited comrades in Shanghai to engage in road construction. For fifteen years, he has actively promoted this, and to this day, the total length of roads completed nationwide has reached more than 100,000 kilometers. Those under construction and planned are even more numerous, like bamboo shoots after the rain, difficult to count. The number of highways nationwide has increased sharply, and municipal administrations in various places are gradually improving. However, remote areas are still not universally covered, and continued efforts should be made to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, the National Economic Committee and the construction departments of various provinces are all working hard on this. We firmly believe that the road construction movement can win the promotion of the whole people. In the near future, the results will certainly meet our hopes. The road construction movement has a hopeful period of success. We should also work together on the following movements: (1) The movement to manufacture automobiles; (2) The movement to manufacture automobile tires; (3) The movement to explore for gasoline. We believe that the above three movements are extremely important at present. In recent years, the business of highway bureaus in various provinces and long-distance automobile companies, the national income, and the profits obtained by private investors have been considerable. The hard work of the authorities and organizers is deeply admirable. However, due to the development of this type of business, the consumption of automobile tires and gasoline has increased accordingly, and this consumption is entirely dependent on imports. The Chinese people are working hard on the highway business, but as a result, most of the income is indirectly sent to foreign capitalists. Thinking of this, we are deeply saddened. The parties concerned are more eager than anyone else to reverse the outflow of national interests and money. This can be asserted. This association plans to invite representatives from the construction departments of various provinces, the highway bureaus of various provinces, and long-distance automobile companies, as well as industrialists, capitalists, and social activists, to jointly discuss concrete measures, and to invite the National Economic Commission to jointly preside over them. This association's proposals for the above three movements are as follows: (1) Regarding the first and second movements, it is hoped that the National Economic Committee, the provincial and municipal governments, the long-distance automobile companies, the industrialists, and the capitalists will subscribe shares separately, gather capital, and set up factories to manufacture; (2) Gather specialized talents and pay more attention to recruiting Chinese talents trained by the British Ford Motor Company to manufacture automobiles; (3) Request the government to subsidize individuals or organizations to explore for oil, and request the government to specify reward measures. Whether individuals or organizations can find oil fields, the government or the people will be given special rights in the future to exploit them, as an incentive. This movement is of great importance to national rights, social economy, and it is hoped that all parties will give detailed instructions and propose measures, so as to request the Resources Committee of the National Economic Commission to jointly convene a meeting to discuss everything, so as to achieve the goal of cooperation between the people and the government, and to see the effectiveness of the people's political ability.</p>
<h3>Soy Sauce Shop Dispute Transferred to the Court for Handling</h3>
<p>Zhang Dasu, chairman of the soy sauce industry association, was accused by more than 100 members of the association, including Zhu Shaolin, of abusing his power for personal gain. They presented the facts and filed complaints with the Central People's Movement Committee and the municipal party headquarters. The representatives have now received the municipal party headquarters' directive No. 4441, which states that the first item of the complaint has already been filed with the local court and should be awaited for legal resolution by the court. As for the second and third items, they should be submitted for public decision when the general membership meeting is convened. It is reported that the representative, Zhu Shaolin, will present the facts again to request the higher authorities to approve the convening of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Woke Up from Afternoon Nap and Suddenly Jumped Out of Window to Commit Suicide: Li Yudong Suffers from Nerve Disorder</h3>
<p>Li Yudong, a native of Shandong, is 19 years old and rents a room in the Rongqing Teahouse on Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei. Yesterday at around 5:00 PM, he woke up from an afternoon nap and suddenly had a suicidal thought. He jumped out of the window, severely injuring his internal organs. He was found by police officer No. 233 of the North Station Branch and was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by hired car. It is reported that Li Yudong has a history of nervous disorder.</p>
<h3>Wu Jinhe, Who Fell and Committed Suicide, Examined</h3>
<p>Wu Jinhe, a native of Liuhe, 59 years old, worked as a waiter in room 85 of the Broadway Mansions on Broadway Road. His son, Wu Hongmao, 26 years old, worked as a typist at the American Asiatic Underwriters on the Bund, No. 17. Wu Jinhe had recently been involved in a debt guarantee dispute in his hometown and was sued by the creditor in the Taicang County Government. The day before yesterday, his sister, who lived in the same Kangli, opposite the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession, was critically ill. In the afternoon, Wu took her to Guangci Hospital for treatment, where she was hospitalized. Wu was anxious about the lawsuit and his sister's illness. That night at 7:00 PM, after finishing his work, he wanted to go to the hospital to visit his sister, but somehow, on the way, he passed the entrance of the Great World and suddenly had a suicidal thought. He bought a ticket and went to the third floor, where he jumped off the escalator and fell to the ground, causing his head to bleed and both hands and feet to be broken. He was unconscious. The staff of the Great World reported it to the French Police Department, who sent him to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 10:30 that night. The hospital notified the police department, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. After his son arrived, the Second Special Court was notified yesterday, and Prosecutor Wang Ren came to the scene to confirm that the deceased had died from injuries sustained in the fall. The body was handed over to his son for funeral arrangements. Unfortunately, the deceased's sister also passed away at Guangci Hospital at the same time as the deceased.</p>
<h3>Woman Died Tragically After Abortion: Case Against Doctor Continues</h3>
<p>Zhou Xue, 21 years old, daughter of Zhou Renmao, a native of Ningbo living at 322 Bo Shi Road, married Chen Shan from the same hometown. She had already given birth to a son, only five months old, and was pregnant again. On August 13th, she went to Xi Zhanyi, a doctor specializing in venereal diseases and obstetrics at 306 Avenue Joffre, Beijing Quandetang, requesting an abortion. Xi gave her medication and performed surgery. Three days later, the fetus was aborted, but the placenta remained in her abdomen, causing continuous bleeding. Her mother sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died on the 20th. The hospital reported it to the French Police Department, who sent Detective Yao Zhupo to arrest Xi Zhanyi, but he had already fled. Only Xi's concubine, Xi Xiaoquan (31 years old, from Tianjin), who was an assistant at the time, was detained. The body was sent to the morgue for examination, and the body was collected for burial. Meanwhile, the police department sent Xi Xiaoquan to the Second Special Court for interrogation. All these circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday at noon, Judge Qiu Huan Ying presided over a continued hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, stated the case, prosecuting based on Article 290, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, for causing death due to abortion. Xi Xiaoquan confessed that her husband, Xi Zhanyi, gave the medicine and surgery, and that she did not help. The next day, the deceased came again, saying that the fetus had been aborted, but the placenta had not been expelled, and asked me to remove it for her. Because I had no experience, I refused and told her to go to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible. She also hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. Next, Zhou Renmao, the father of the deceased, stated that his daughter originally lived in Nanjing with her husband, and came to Shanghai in April to study obstetrics at the Ximen Hospital. On August 16th, she asked her mother to go and see her, saying that she had a fever and chills, so she was sent to Guangren Hospital. Dr. Zhang diagnosed that it was caused by an abortion and that the treatment was ineffective, resulting in death. He requested that the defendant be severely punished. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer, Fan Gang, supplemented his opinion, stating that the deceased arrived at the defendant's place by rickshaw No. 3710 at 9:00 PM on August 16th, requesting treatment. The rickshaw cushion was already stained with blood. Whether the abortion was performed by the defendant is a question. He requested that rickshaw driver Zhou Zhilin be summoned to court for questioning. The court verified the confessions and, because the case still needed to be investigated and evidence examined, postponed the hearing to the morning of September 9th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Bleeding for Election: Wang Guansheng's Back of Head Chopped, Foot Bone Broken; Fight Over a Seat on the Tofu Guild Board</h3>
<p>Wang Guansheng, owner of the Wang Shunxing tofu shop on Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, had a feud with his colleagues during the election of the board of directors a few days ago. Unexpectedly, during lunch a few days ago, a thug suddenly chopped Wang Guansheng on the back of the head with an axe, causing serious injuries and breaking his foot bone. He was sent to Qu Zhibu Hospital for treatment. Wang then filed a complaint with the police station, stating that Xu Haitao, a fellow tofu maker, wanted to seize the seat on the Tofu Guild Board and resorted to such a vicious act. The police station is investigating the matter. Xu Haitao went to the Qiaojiazha Tofu Guild for a meeting a few days ago, which Wang's wife learned about and rushed to arrest Xu and hand him over to the Xundao Street Police Station, who transferred him to the Wenmiao Road Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suspects in the Qidong Murder and Arson Case Extradited from Shanghai Yesterday: Two Suspects Confess to Robbery and Murder; Court Approves Extradition to Qidong</h3>
<p>In May of this year, a large group of bandits in Meijia Town, Qidong County, armed with weapons, invaded, murdered, and set fires. At that time, the residence of Shen, the village chief of the first district of the town, was burned by the bandits, and the homes of residents Song Tianwu and Bao Zhang Xu Ziyuan were also robbed by these people, who fled with the stolen goods. After a secret investigation by Xu Hongfu of the Qidong County Government, it was discovered that two key suspects in the case, Dai A'gang and Xu Renchang (also known as Xu Shishi), had fled and were hiding at No. 20 Doupai, 234 Lane, Mabai Road, Shanghai Public Concession. So he came to Shanghai a few days ago, reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, who assisted the Chinese and Western detectives in arresting Dai and Xu and detaining them in the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the date for the continued interrogation had arrived, and Qidong County had also prepared official documents and sent detective Xu Hongfu and eyewitness Huang A'gen to the court, requesting extradition. Huang A'gen confessed that he was from Qidong, 31 years old, and proved that Dai and Xu were indeed involved in the robbery and murder case. Zhang Tianyin, the police station lawyer, agreed to the extradition. Judge Huang Risheng ordered Dai and Xu to be handed over to the officials from the Qidong County Government to be taken back to Qidong for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lao Zha Police Station Captures Many Thieves, Seizes Guns and Bullets, Detains Suspects for Investigation of Cases and Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Li Shugui, a Chinese detective of the Lao Zha Police Station, and detectives Xue Youwen and Ding Yizhong, learned that many thieves were hiding at No. 376 Maite Hersh's Road, so they secretly went to arrest them at 8:30 AM the day before yesterday. They arrested Wang Shaokang (also known as Xiao Wu) and Ding Youjin (also known as Chen Hanzhang), both from Anhui, on the spot. They found a Lianqian pistol and a bullet on Wang, as well as two automatic pistol bullets. They were taken back to the police station, and they confessed that the pistol was supplied by Zhao Chenquan (also known as Zhao Lao San), who lived at No. 211, Lane 679, Xiaoshadu Road, for use in committing crimes. So they went and arrested Zhao. Then, Detective Li and others received a tip-off and continued to capture Fang Fabiao and Shi Yucheng, both from Anhui, near Xiaoshadu Road. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police Station Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted Wang, Ding, and Zhao according to Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Military Firearms, requesting a postponement to facilitate the investigation of the crimes they committed. As for Fang and Shi, they requested permission to be detained and claimed that the report obtained by the police station indicated that Fang and others were accomplices of Wang and others. However, after investigation, it was found that Fang and Shi may be related to the bombing case, and a postponement of the hearing was also requested. After Judge Feng Shide verified the report and briefly questioned Wang and others, he ordered the hearing to be postponed for another week.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Opera Association Sues; Verdict on Sichuan Opera Special Issue; Lu Han Cheng and Others Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Shi Chunxuan, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Research Association, No. 1 Fuchang Lane, Yunnan Road, Public Concession, represented the association and hired lawyer Zhou Lianze to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Court against Yu Hancheng, the manager of the Sichuan Grand Stage, currently performing at the New Guangda Theater, and Sun Jiayu and Liu Zuoxiang (all from Sichuan), the editors of the Sichuan Opera Special Issue, alleging that the first issue of the Sichuan Opera Special Issue, published on August 5th, contained libelous statements against all members of the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Research Association, damaging their reputation, and requesting an investigation. The case was once heard by Judge Sun Pengxian, who announced the conclusion and scheduled a date for the verdict. All these circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the date for the verdict arrived, and neither party was present. Judge Sun presided over the Second Criminal Court and ruled that Lu Hancheng, Sun Jiayu, and Liu Zuoxiang were all not guilty. It is reported that the plaintiff side is dissatisfied with this verdict and will file an appeal with the High Third Branch Court.</p>
<h3>Tomb Robbing: Qin Zhuangyuan's Tomb Robbed; Jade Cup, Jade Bracelet, and Incense Burner Found; Dispute Over Unequal Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>A man named Huang Lao Si from Huanglou Township, Nanhui Third District, Pudong, has been doing business outside and has accumulated some wealth. He previously purchased a piece of land in the Thirty-Seventh District, which contained the Qin family tomb. A certain Jia from the township, after learning that the Qin family had produced a Zhuangyuan (top scholar) in the past and that there must be valuable items in the tomb, hired a professional tomb raider, Zhou, to open the tomb at night. He obtained valuable items such as a pair of jade cups and jade bracelets. Zhou stole a gold incense burner and sold it to a pawnshop. Jia learned of this and went to negotiate, demanding that Zhou hand over the gold incense burner. The Qin family has now learned of this and is pursuing the matter.</p>

<h3>Liu and Li to be Re-tried on September 7th</h3>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the shareholders of the China Industrial Bank, Zhang Chongfu and He Jieshun, have successively sued Liu Huizhi and others criminally. The court's trial proceedings have been reported in previous issues. Zhang Chongfu's case only sues Liu Huizhi alone. He Jieshun and five others, regarding the loan from Wuhu Yuzhong Textile Company to China Industrial Bank, also sued Li Jizhi, a director of China Industrial Bank. However, it is heard that Li Jizhi has managed Huaxin's various yarn factories and achieved excellent results. The board of directors of Shanyu Zhong Company hired him as general manager. According to He Jieshun and others, Liu Huizhi was a director of Yuzhong at that time, but Liu denied it. Li Jizhi's defense lawyer also asked the court to investigate the list of Yuzhong directors. It seems that this cannot be disputed by mere words. Since the China Industrial Bank has adopted a manager system, all external matters are handled by the manager's office, and the board of directors only manages internal legislative matters. It is unfortunate that Li was involved in the case as a director. The case is now scheduled for re-trial at 2:00 PM on September 7th, at which time there will be a debate between both parties.</p>
<h3>Talk on the Li Da Company's Accountant Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Yan Gongyin, the accountant of Lida Wireless Radio Co., Ltd., 395 Jing'an Temple Road, embezzled company funds, which has been reported in this newspaper. According to Mr. Zhou, the chairman of the company and one of the partners before the company's reorganization, the accountant was usually competent in his work. Recently, he suddenly had an affair and there was embezzlement. On July 25th, he absconded with the funds. The company reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station for arrest. The police station then learned that Yan Gongyin was hiding in Hangzhou and ordered detectives to go to Hangzhou and arrest him at the address. He was extradited back to Shanghai and sent to the First Special Court for prosecution. During the interrogation, Yan Gongyin admitted to embezzling 5,000 yuan of public funds and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for two years, for the crime of embezzlement. The embezzled funds were retrieved by the police station and handed over to the company for collection. As for the accounts at the time of the company's reorganization, all shareholders reviewed them clearly at the time. Yu (Mr. Zhou referring to himself) was one of the original partners and knew the details best. The allegation that Manager Xi embezzled funds is obviously a slander by Yan Gongyin to reduce his sentence and is not true.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Having recently read the article "Mr. Ling Fuchu and Wife Involved in Litigation" in your esteemed newspaper on September 1st, which stated that Mr. Ling is the owner of our factory, we hereby inform you that Mr. Ling is neither a part of our factory nor holds any office or position. It is clearly based on inaccurate rumors. We are writing to request that you make an immediate correction. We thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>China Winery</p>
<p>September 2nd</p>
<p>Respected Sir:</p>
<p>On August 31st, your newspaper's news column published an article stating that Wang Yinxiang and six others, under the guise of preparing for the establishment of the Shanghai Association of Merchants Transporting Chalk, defrauded fellow boatmen Hao Huiquan, Zhou Yu Jiu, Lu Yu Xiang, and others, obtaining one hundred and thirteen yuan. Upon reading this, our association was shocked. Such news is likely based on inaccurate rumors. After investigation, it was found that from the very beginning of its preparation, our association submitted an application for approval to the City Party Headquarters, is a legal organization, and has no extracurricular activities. It was officially established on August 20th, and the one yuan startup fee collected from each household was voluntary, with no coercion involved. In addition to pursuing legal action to avoid being wronged, we are specially requesting your newspaper to publish this letter in the letters column for correction. We respectfully address this to the Editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper Editorial Department.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai Association of Merchants Transporting Chalk</p>
<p>September 1st</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>We have noticed that your newspaper's local news column carried a news item about a truck accident, which does not correspond with the facts. Yesterday morning, a truck from our company was traveling west on Shandong Road and passing the intersection of Old Ma Road and Yongsheng Grindstone when a Chongming villager, newly arrived in Shanghai and unfamiliar with the roads, became flustered and ran when he saw the truck. Our driver, Mr. Chang, immediately stopped the truck and told him to move aside. The villager, in his panic, only slightly grazed his skin and suffered a minor injury. As for the worker Xu Asan, our company does not employ such a person, nor did anyone fall from the truck or injure an arm. The grazed villager was taken to the hospital for bandaging and was immediately discharged, with no detention involved. Fearing that the report was inaccurate, we are writing to inform you of the truth, and we request that you make a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3>Announcing the Adjustment of the Chinese Buddhist Association to All Monks and Nuns in the Country</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tinghao</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association, from its inception to the present, although it has some history, its organization has never been sound, and most monks and nuns have not joined. Of course, there may be one or two monks and nuns with both wisdom and virtue who are unwilling to join for the sake of personal practice. However, because the organization and facilities of the association have not fully satisfied people's expectations, it is feared that not a few are unwilling to join. Perhaps there are still some monks and nuns who simply do not know that there is a Chinese Buddhist Association, let alone join it. The small number of monks involved in the association's affairs are rarely able to adhere to the Buddhist teachings of "no self, no dispute." Most are stubbornly attached to their own ego, and because of differences in thought and opinion, they secretly divide into new and old factions, each supporting their leaders and vying for leadership. Therefore, the more knowledgeable Yuan Ying and Tai Xu have become objects of support for these monks and nuns. Thus, outsiders believe that the dispute within the Chinese Buddhist Association is the dispute between Yuan Ying and Tai Xu, which is truly, Amitabha. Although there are many factions among monks and nuns across the country, I think that if the leaders of these two major factions can truly lead by example, dissolve their prejudices, adhere to the Buddhist teachings of "no self, no contention," and cooperate sincerely, the dispute within the Chinese Buddhist Association could be at least halved. If the dispute is not resolved, the unity will not be strong. If the unity is not strong, the affairs of the association will naturally be unable to be promoted. Since the dispute within the Buddhist Association is largely related to Yuan Ying and Tai Xu, Yuan Ying and Tai Xu cannot shirk their responsibility for the past failure of the Buddhist Association's affairs to be promoted smoothly. Thus, whether the Buddhist Association can "unite all monks and nuns in the country, regulate the precepts, propagate the teachings, promote the spirit of Mahayana salvation, benefit the people, and benefit society," and fulfill the mission of promoting the Dharma and benefiting the world, although monks and nuns in general should work together, Yuan Ying and Tai Xu should unite sincerely and set an example for monks and nuns across the country, ensuring that the group of Shakyans with no self and no dispute will no longer have disputes, so that they will not be ashamed of being Buddhist disciples and leaders of the community.</p>
<p>I was ordered to adjust the Chinese Buddhist Association and spent several months of investigation and research to see the source of the diseases of the Chinese Buddhist Association and the general abbots and monks. The source of the disease of the Buddhist Association has been explained in the previous section. The source of the disease of the general abbots and monks lies in abandoning the inherent duty of promoting the Dharma and benefiting the world. The abbots regard the temple monks and religious property as private property, and devote themselves to maintaining religious property as their only task. The rest of the monks and nuns regard performing Buddhist rituals for patrons as a profession, thinking that attending Buddhist rituals is fulfilling the responsibility that should be fulfilled as a monk. They do not understand the scriptures, do not observe the precepts, no wonder the lion worms increase day by day, the monks' virtues decline day by day, and the teachings decline day by day.</p>
<p>I cannot bear the name without substance of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and the increasing degradation of the personality of monks and nuns, so I decided to draft seventy articles to revise the draft of the Chinese Buddhist Association's charter for the Buddhist Association, and attach an explanation. With the approval of the Minister, I, in my capacity as the director of the competent authority, first handed over the draft charter to the current chairman of the association, the monk Yuan Ying, to be forwarded to all directors and supervisors and monks and nuns in various places for thorough study, and to express their opinions as much as possible. The intention is nothing more than to urge monks and nuns across the country to pay attention to the Chinese Buddhist Association, to pool their efforts, and to achieve the purpose of enlightening others and benefiting others from self-awareness, self-help, and self-government. The draft charter could have been submitted to the Minister for approval and ordered the Chinese Buddhist Association to comply with it by ministerial order, because I hope that monks and nuns across the country will understand the intention of the central government to adjust the Chinese Buddhist Association, so as not to be incited by one or two reckless people, and at the same time, to give them the opportunity to participate in the discussion and contribute their opinions on the draft charter, which is related to their own interests. And by this, it can also test whether Chinese Buddhists have a real understanding and belief in Buddhism, so the draft charter was first handed over to the monk Yuan Ying to be forwarded to the monks and nuns for public study. This is my motivation and sincerity for drafting the charter for the Chinese Buddhist Association. The draft charter is certainly not perfect, and there may be some provisions that should be revised or supplemented, but compared with the current charter of the association, I dare say that it is much more complete. In the past few weeks, I have received opinions from monks and nuns in various places on the draft charter, and the texts seen in the newspapers have mostly expressed agreement. However, recently, news has come from friends in Shanghai that a few monks and laymen seem to have doubts about the four points in the draft charter, and I will explain them separately later.

<h3>Owens Has Become a Professional Athlete: Accepts a Reward of $5,000 a Week, Will Go to Various Places to Perform or Appear on Stage</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York, 1st: Black athlete Owens, who participated in the 11th Olympic Games in Berlin last month and won the 100 meters, 200 meters, and long jump championships, has returned with honor. He suddenly joined the professional athlete team and is said to have accepted a reward of $5,000 a week. He joined the professional track and field team and will travel with Turun, the champion of the 100 meters at the 10th Olympic Games (also a black man), to perform for ten weeks, and then go to Australia and Japan to perform.</p>
<p>New York, September 1st, Reuters: The world-renowned black athlete Owens has turned professional. Owens has signed a contract with a theater performance host to perform professional races or appear on stage.</p>
<p>Owens's Biography</p>
<p>Owens, this year's Berlin World Games, won the 100 meters, 200 meters, and long jump championships. He will be 22 years old on the 12th of this month (September). He has seven siblings. When he was four years old, the whole family moved to Cleveland, Ohio. A few years later, when he was studying at Fairmont Junior High School, he was playing games with children in front of the school. Coach Charles Riley's swift pace made a deep impression on Owens. Riley asked Owens why he didn't make considerable efforts in track and field. Owens's legs had developed beyond his age. After Owens and Riley negotiated with his family for a long time, they agreed to start practicing track and field.</p>
<p>High School Life</p>
<p>Soon after his amazing track and field life began, Owens did not forget Riley's cultivation, and immediately gave Riley a watch won in a university intercollegiate competition. In high school, Owens created three national secondary school records. Not long ago, after Owens created a record of 9.4 seconds, twenty-eight universities and colleges persuaded him to transfer. When Owens was preparing to enter university, these universities became one of his learning schools.</p>
<p>University Life</p>
<p>Owens entered Ohio State University. His sophomore year was his first year as a university athlete. He participated in the Nine University Games and Owens scored a total of 115 points, twenty-one firsts, two seconds, and two thirds. During his university studies, Owens read while working, and worked as a gas station attendant in his spare time. Owens is similar to the heavyweight boxing champion Louis of the sensational state of Georgia. Not only did he study and work, but he also used his savings to support his family, sending a portion of his income to his family in Cleveland every week.</p>
<h3>Record of Our National Team's Expedition (11th Letter) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>The Sixth Day of the Games</p>
<p>Since the opening of the games, it has been windy and rainy every day. It was not until the sixth day that the weather was clear. German leader Hitler came to the track and field stadium to watch every day after 3:00 pm, which has become a daily routine since the opening of the games.

<p>Triple Jump 16 Meters</p>
<p>The triple jump was held in two groups at 10:30 am. The qualifying standard was set at 14 meters. The finalists will participate in the finals in the afternoon. Our national team player Situ Guang was in the first group, and Wang Shilin was in the second group. Both of them have strengths above 14 meters. I don't know why they both failed to jump in the trial, so they were not qualified to participate in the preliminaries. However, of the 37 athletes who participated, only 23 qualified. The preliminary round was held at 4:30 pm. Each person jumped three times. Japanese athlete Tajima Naoto jumped 15.76 meters in the first jump, breaking the Games record (the Games record was 15.72 meters set by Japanese Nambu Chuhei in 1932), and ranked first. The second jump was out of bounds, and the third jump was also 15.44 meters. The world record (15.78 meters set in 1935) holder, Australian Metcalfe, scored 15.50 meters in the first jump, the second jump was out of bounds, and the third jump was 14.67 meters, ranking second. The third was Japanese athlete Harada Masao, with a jump of 15.39 meters, a second jump of 15.45 meters, and a third jump of 15.42 meters. The fourth was German athlete Warner, with a first jump of 15.37 meters, and the second and third jumps were out of bounds. The fifth was Japanese athlete Oshima Kamakichi, with a first jump of 15.07 meters, and the second and third jumps were also out of bounds. The sixth was American athlete Romano, with a first jump of 14.68 meters, a second jump out of bounds, and a third jump of 14.90 meters. The two Japanese athletes were both listed among the six finalists, and their momentum was extremely strong. The finals were held immediately. Romano jumped first, the first jump was out of bounds, the second jump was 15.08 meters, just surpassing Japanese athlete Oshima, and the third jump slightly regressed to 15.04 meters. Oshima's first jump was out of bounds, and his ranking dropped to sixth. Warner's first jump was 14.53 meters, the second jump was out of bounds, and the third jump was 14.23 meters, with no progress, and remained in fourth place. Harada's first jump was 15.50 meters, already tied with Metcalfe, the second jump regressed to 15.27 meters, and the third jump advanced to 15.66 meters, surpassing Metcalfe, while Metcalfe's three jumps, the first jump was only 14.83 meters, the second jump was out of bounds, and the third jump was only 15.20 meters, and retreated to third. The veterans in this competition were generally depressed, in other words, the strength of the newcomers is terrifying. Japanese Tajima's results in the preliminary round were already firmly ranked first, but in the first jump of the finals, he achieved a score of 16 meters, breaking the world record, which is as valuable as Owens' long jump. The second jump was 15.65 meters, and the third jump was out of bounds. The complete results are as follows:</p>
<p>Tajima Naoto (Japan) 16 meters</p>
<p>Harada Masao (Japan) 15.66 meters</p>
<p>Metcalfe (Australia) 15.50 meters</p>
<p>Warner (Germany) 15.27 meters</p>
<p>Romano (USA) 15.08 meters</p>
<p>Oshima Kamakichi (Japan) 15.07 meters</p>
<p>Unsuccessful Candidates</p>
<p>Jock (Germany) 14.88 meters</p>
<p>Welchons (USA) 14.83 meters</p>
<p>Stolmanra (Finland) 14.72 meters</p>
<p>Lang (Germany) 14.62 meters</p>
<p>Somlo (Hungary) 14.60 meters</p>
<p>La Yasalari (Finland) 14.59 meters</p>
<p>Wagland (Norway) 14.56 meters</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua and Defu Will Fight He Jialiu and Liu Jie Today: At the Kangdi Club at 4:30 pm for the Second Week of Grass Doubles</h3>
<p>Our national tennis player Lin Baohua, since returning from Europe, has been participating in grass court matches for days, and the battle has been extremely conclusive. In the advanced singles match. First won He Jialiu, then won Masoli and entered the quarter-final week, and doubles also cooperated with Defu to defeat Feijikesi and Pantiduo. In the second week, they will meet He Jialiu and Liu Jie. The original battle was scheduled at the Kangdi Club yesterday, but it was canceled due to wet ground. It has been decided that the game will be held at the Kangdi Club at 4:30 pm today. Although He and Liu are outstanding, it is feared that it will be difficult to deal with the cooperation of these two heroes. However, the excitement of the battle can be predicted. Defu is far inferior to Carson in singles, but in doubles, he cooperated with Ponawei district, and is almost invincible in Shanghai. Now he is cooperating with Lin Baohua, and its beauty is naturally above Ponawei district. Preparing for this year's grass doubles championship, it will be in the bag of Lin and De.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Rumor of Increased Import Taxes in Hebei and Chahar Causes Market Crash, Followed by Recovery Due to Profit-Taking</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced a morning drop followed by an afternoon recovery, but the trend was exceptionally volatile. This was because of divided opinions. Rumors spread that Hebei and Chahar were planning to impose new taxes on imported goods, causing sellers to become extremely active, especially foreign firms who rushed to sell off their holdings. In the afternoon, it was said that three firms profited handsomely and left the market, which was a good thing.</p>
<p>Price of Marked Yarn Still Drops by 50-60 Cents</p>
<p>In the early market for marked yarn, American cotton continued to rise, and the price of third-grade yarn also increased. Both bulls and bears were active in the market, resulting in inconsistent prices, with near-term contracts falling by 30-40 cents and far-term contracts rising by 20-70 cents. Unexpectedly, in the second session, the near-term decline moderated, while the far-term contracts fell by 1.37 yuan. Mingde, Hexing, Runkang, and Fukang engaged in heavy selling, while Hengyi, Gengfeng, Ruida, Senkang, and Xincheng actively covered their short positions. However, the overall situation remained weak, and as a result, prices for all months fell by 70-90 cents to 1.34 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere was quite weak at the opening of the afternoon session. Concerns about the Hebei and Chahar tariff issue led to unease, causing prices to decline steadily. Subsequently, large players took profits, causing the market to recover sharply. As a result, prices for all months rose by 40-60 cents to 1.10 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Xincheng sold 4,500 bales, Deda 1,200 bales, Tongji 1,600 bales, Juxing 1,400 bales, Jinchang 1,200 bales, Mingde 3,450 bales, Hexing 1,600 bales, Huamao 1,200 bales, Shenji 2,200 bales, Runkang 3,150 bales, Shengyuan 2,000 bales, and Jinkang 2,000 bales. Chengji bought 1,600 bales, Hengyi 3,000 bales, Yuda 2,450 bales, Dafeng 2,750 bales, Gengfeng 6,150 bales, Ruida 2,900 bales, and Senkang 3,500 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Price Drops by One Yuan</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn remained good. Today, various merchants purchased a total of 1,043 bales, with the price falling by one yuan. The purchase amounts for each merchant were as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 15 Guangdong 385 Inland 211</p>
<p>Ningbo 15 Tianjin 150 Changsha 210</p>
<p>Sichuan 75 Hankou 2</p>
<h3>Cotton: Unstable Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained weak, changing several times a day, but the overall trend did not deviate from a consolidation pattern. In reality, the harvest was abundant, and the market direction was not strong, coupled with foreign merchants selling off their holdings step by step, exerting significant pressure. However, in the afternoon session, short sellers took profits, causing prices to rise.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Also Experiences Short Covering</p>
<p>In the early market for marked cotton, American cotton continued to rise by 8-11 points, and Osaka third-grade cotton rose by 50-60 cents. Market sentiment was slightly firm, and the weather was hot and humid, with intermittent sunshine and clouds, so there was no significant hidden selling. Prices for all months rose by 10-20 cents. Unexpectedly, in the second session, Juxing, Tongfeng, Fengtai, Yichang, Runkang, and Fukang uniformly offered to sell, and sellers took the opportunity to exert downward pressure, causing the decline to accelerate. The October contract broke through the seven-yuan level. The market recovered slightly in the third session, and the closing price returned to the same level. Changhe, Dafu, Yuda, Gengfeng, Yuanyi, and Yuanxingchang covered their short positions extensively. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.05-1.30 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market appeared ordinary and weak. Subsequently, short covering led to a price increase, resulting in prices for all contracts rising by 0.15-0.20 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Yuda sold 10,000 dan, Changfeng 2,600 dan, Daji 1,200 dan, Dafeng 2,000 dan, Hengyi 2,600 dan, Juxing 9,800 dan, Tongfeng 3,500 dan, Fengtai 5,000 dan, Shenji 2,700 dan, and Yichang 4,400 dan. Changhe bought 11,700 dan, Dachang 4,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,700 dan, Yuanyi 5,000 dan, Gengfeng 8,100 dan, Dafeng 4,500 dan, and Tongji 2,800 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Japanese Merchants Dumping White Goods, Dye Factories Buying the Most Fine Twills – Chinese Factories' Light and Heavy Weight Coarse Cloth Also Slacken –</h3>
<p>Yesterday, marked yarn and cotton were affected by raw cotton, continuing to decline, and the cotton cloth market felt increasingly unsustainable. Printed cloth fell by about 10 cents per piece. Dealers, in view of the tendency of Japanese merchants to dump white goods, including Longtou, Yanghe, Jixiang, Flower and Bird brands, and fine cloth, Blue Double Fish, Yanghe, Baobei brands, fine twills were secretly reduced in price. The local dye factories, because the autumn color cloth and color twills were still strong, occasionally bought spot white goods at cheap prices. Yesterday, various dye factories bought 300 pieces of various goods, with fine twills the most. The decline of fine cloth and fine twills from local factories was slower, still falling by 5-10 cents per piece yesterday. The 15.5-pound San Yuan Bao and 10-pound Jumping Child coarse cloth from the Japanese Shanghai factory, and the light and heavy weight coarse cloth from Chinese merchants such as Dasheng, Qingfeng, and Shenxin factories, also became more slack, falling by 9 cents per piece. Sales to customers were stagnant, and due to the raw cotton situation, everyone was wary. However, delivery of orders to various merchants was still busy, with inland and Yangtze replenishing sporadically, while the Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Yunnan areas gradually became active, replenishing mainly local factory fine cloth, fine twills, Zhigong, Serge, Flannel, and Printed Velvet goods, totaling 500 pieces. The Henan, Shaanxi, Northwest Road, and Shandong provinces still had a strong demand for Flannel, Printed Zhigong, and Serge.</p>
<h3>Riding Breeches and Herringbone Tweed Both Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Herringbone tweed is a popular woolen fabric for autumn and winter sales. Its sales are as widespread as riding breeches. Many are now being launched on the market, and customers have already purchased them, but the prices are very high, due to the lack of inventory. The best quality herringbone overcoat tweed usually sells for 7.75 yuan per yard, medium-grade goods for 6.5 yuan per yard, second-grade for 5 yuan, third-grade for 4.45 yuan, fourth-grade for 3.4 yuan, and lower-grade fifth-grade goods for 2.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales season for riding breeches is the same as for herringbone tweed. 70-80% of Chinese and Western suits and overcoats are made from it. Small and large woolen clothing stores all sell it. It has been popular for five or six years. This autumn, due to expensive arrivals, prices have also risen. Yesterday, 1005 rose to 8.25 yuan, ordinary goods sold for 6.4 yuan, Zhanghua National Goods for 5.6 yuan, East goods top-grade Chong 1005 for 6.75 yuan, and last grade for 4.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rumors of Japanese Merchants Buying Flour, Futures Flour and Wheat Rise Sharply in the Afternoon – Flour Up 4 Cents… Wheat Jumps 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Flour: After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month presented a sharp rise after a fall, with foreign wheat quotations continuing to fall by one or two cents each. At the time of opening, the opening price broke through the one-cent mark, as low as 3.08 yuan, and futures months also fell by one or two cents. By the close, due to short covering, there was a slight rebound. When the afternoon session opened, it was flat at first, and later, non-professionals competed to cover short positions, and rumors spread that they would abandon wheat and buy flour, causing people to panic again, and buying increased greatly, and the months rose sharply, rising by two, three, or four cents more than the previous day. Such rumors are certainly unbelievable, but most of the rise was mainly due to short covering.</p>
<p>Wheat: The opening of the wheat market in the morning presented a rise after a flat start, with foreign wheat quotations down slightly by one or two cents, so the opening price for September and October continued to fall by two or three cents, and transactions below November were clear, and the debt was slightly stable. When the afternoon session opened, it was still stable at first, and later, the high price of the flour market boosted it greatly, causing the flour prices for each month after the first session to jump greatly. The reason for the rise was nothing more than the rumor of Japanese merchants buying flour, which caused excitement, and from six, seven, or eight cents higher than the previous day's closing price, it rose to as much as one dime. If the follow-up is not true, it is bound to rebound. The current wheat market is no longer rejected by factory customers, and they are selectively buying high-quality wheat, with Lin Huai Guan Ming Guang wheat at 4.95 yuan, second-grade at 4.9 yuan, Southern Suzhou wheat at 4.5 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 4.85 yuan, second-grade at 4.83 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.77 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 4.72 yuan, and Huangqiao wheat at 4.78 yuan, with various factories such as Bufeng and Shenda buying more than 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Rice: High-Quality Rice Has Some Outlets</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 15 or 16 ships arrived from various merchants, carrying a total of more than 3,000 shi of goods. Sales still only pick and choose the good ones, and those of medium quality are rarely patronized. Although there are merchants from Xi'an, Haizhou, and Qingdao purchasing, the number is only 400 or 500 bags, and they all choose high-quality rice, so the market for thick and thin rice seems to be in a situation of raising the price of high-quality rice and lowering the price of low-quality rice. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan have no glory or disgrace, Dongxin is more than before, arriving at a total of 700 or 800 shi, and the price remains the same, Xin Jian is flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 ships arrived from various merchants downriver. The sales of various goods on the market, Bai Geng high-quality rice were loose, and the number of medium-quality rice was slightly larger, Bo Dao Yang Du Bu Xin Ke Jian Dong Xin Geng was flat, Bian Yuan was still available, and the market shape of Bai Geng Yang Du Bu Jian Bo Dao price was extremely stable, Xin Ke Jian was weak, Bian Yuan stood tall, and Dong Xin Geng stood firm. Yesterday, dozens of shi of Kunshan Jiashan Xin Yang Jian arrived, and the price opened at 8.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rough Ke Xian Cantonese Sales Recover Smoothly – This Street, Inland, and Yongmin Also Have Purchases –</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian arrivals were still strong, with more than 10,000 bags of new arrivals from various routes continuing to arrive. After the continuous influx of arrivals day after day, it was unable to sell as smoothly as it had been in previous days, and the bottom stock gradually thickened, and merchants and cargo owners were all eager to get rid of it, so the market atmosphere in the morning was very depressed, and the market seemed to have a tendency to fall again. Then, because Cantonese merchants resumed smooth purchases, and the intake on this street was also fragrant, inland Beiyang Yongmin merchants also took advantage of this cheap price to do their best to purchase, so the market was very lively, with rough rice being smoothly purchased by the Cantonese routes, and more than 17,000 bags were sold throughout the day. Machine rice was active for both merchants and customers, and more than 7,000 or 8,000 bags were also sold. The market price rose after the customers recovered in the afternoon, and the market price turned better by several cents, but the cargo owners were still eager to sell because the output from the producing areas was very strong, and they were willing to sell at a lower price. Throughout the day, 2,730 bags of Jiangxi rice, 15,394 bags of Xiang rice, 10,000 bags of Han rough rice, and 142 bags of Taiwan rice were sold.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Fall, Sales Active</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai silk market has been slow for foreign firms for a long time, and because hoarding households are releasing goods, silk prices have been falling day by day. As of yesterday, ordinary B-grade white silk has approached the 600 yuan mark, so yesterday, although overseas silk prices have not improved, Dachang, Dafeng, Yihua, and other firms have all taken the opportunity to purchase, with a total of 120 bales sold. On the user side, there have only been sporadic purchases in recent days, and yesterday there were also large transactions, such as Tianyi, Meya, and other factories, and the intake of the Hangzhou and Huzhou merchants was also strong yesterday. Although prices have fallen, the transaction volume of white silk and Sichuan warp has reached more than 300 bales, which is the most popular period in more than a month.</p>
<h3>Keemun Black Tea Transactions Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market was quite busy, with black teas from Keemun, Fuliang, Zhizhi, and other routes, and British firms such as Xiehe and Jinlong, all having intake. Yihua, Tongfu, and Russian tea purchasing agencies also sent many telegrams, and the market gradually became smooth. As for green tea sales, there were no major transactions. Only firms such as Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tianxiang made sporadic replenishments for Zhenmei from Tunxi, Wuyuan, Yushan, and other routes. The Soviet Tea Department, although it opened again yesterday for Zhenmei with excellent bottom quality, the intake was not large, and the market situation remained stable.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market is still quiet. In recent days, the various firms are preparing to load ships, and all transactions are nothing more than a slight supplement to the insufficient quantity, so transactions are few. Xiehe entered more than a hundred boxes of Tun Zhen, priced at 95 yuan, then Zhenmei 50 boxes, priced at 52 yuan, and Xiaozhenmei more than a hundred boxes, priced at 40 yuan. Tianxiang entered 50 boxes of Chou Zhen, priced at 103.4 yuan. Jinlong purchased dozens of boxes of Yushan Zhen, priced at 36.7 yuan. Other Tongfu and Shede also had a small number of Zhenmei transactions. Jin Ji, of the Pingshui Tea Firm, continued to dismantle and handle middle and lower-grade teas for the big merchants, and Xiehe handled more than 600 boxes of Mei tea, priced at 23 yuan and 27 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Fungus Prices in Hankou Have Stabilized, Lotus Seeds Tighten</h3>
<p>Fungus: Since the price of production has loosened, the Shanghai market has also been very sluggish. According to a letter from Hankou yesterday, the price of handling has gradually stabilized. For example, Hekou fungus opened at 79.6 yuan, and nearly 400 bags were handled from Guangdong and Jiangxi. There were 500 bags of existing stock from Yecheng, Nanzhang, and other goods. Gucheng fungus opened more than a hundred bags, at 76.6 yuan, but the decision was made to reduce it slightly, and there were also more than 500 bags in stock. Kui fungus Hekou Xing'an goods were at 120 yuan, and the rest was reduced accordingly. The existing stock was less than 200 bags. Here, such as small packages of fungus from Dingshang Dingsheng Aviation brand were priced at 99 yuan, miscellaneous brands were discounted, and the market image was flat.</p>
<p>Lotus Seeds: According to a letter from Hankou, the production price has tightened. For example, the Yun of Benhu was at 35 yuan, and the purchase had been made. Hengzhou lotus also needed 25 yuan, Zhen Jiuxi lotus was at 34.8 yuan, Chong Jiuxi lotus was at 32.6 yuan, and there were signs of a rise.</p>
<h3>Wu Xun, the Beggar Who Founded Schools</h3>
<p>— Han Depu</p>
<p>"Eating well is not enough, building a charity school is what counts! Don't laugh at me for begging, just watch me build a charity school!"</p>
<p>During the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, an extraordinary person emerged in Tangyi County, Shandong. This person had a very peculiar temperament, not caring about food or clothing, but with a special love for establishing charity schools, specifically for accepting children from poor families to study—without charging a single penny. He established a total of three such charity schools. One might assume he was a wealthy scholar, but in fact, the opposite was true. He was not only illiterate but also a poor beggar. Perhaps you are skeptical? How could an illiterate beggar establish several charity schools? Isn't that strange? Indeed! Precisely because it is strange, it is worth recounting here.</p>
<p>This remarkable person's surname was Wu, given name Xun, the seventh child, living in Wujia Village, Tangyi County, where generations had farmed for a living. By Wu Xun's time, several consecutive years of famine meant the meager harvest couldn't feed the family. The family gradually declined. Wu Xun was already an adult, and seeing the situation was unsustainable, besides his elder brother and sister-in-law who went out to make a living, there was also a widowed mother in her fifties or sixties. It was a case of being under another's roof, and one could only lower one's head. In this situation, one could only brazenly take a broken basket, a broken bowl, and a dog-beating stick to beg for food.</p>
<p>Although Wu Xun begged for a living, he was very kind. He went out to beg for food every day, regardless of wind or rain. He would bring back any decent leftovers for his mother, and only eat what remained himself. The locals knew this and praised him as a filial beggar. After two years, Wu Xun's mother died of an old ailment, leaving Wu Xun alone. He then asked someone to introduce him to a scholarly family to work as a servant.</p>
<p>Although this family claimed to be from a family of scholars, the master was an exceptionally stingy pedant. His belly was full of poetry and the sayings of Confucius, his books never leaving his hand, giving the impression of importance, but in reality, he was a terrible person, constantly scheming against others. Wu Xun's employment in this family was truly unlucky.</p>
<p>One day, Wu Xun's sister asked someone to bring a letter and two strings of coins. It happened that Wu Xun had gone to the river to fetch water. The messenger thought it safest to hand them to the master to pass on to Wu Xun, and then left. Unexpectedly, the pedant saw the two strings of shiny coins and became envious. His mind twisted, and he planned to pocket them all. After all, Wu Xun was illiterate, how would he know?</p>
<p>When Wu Xun returned, the pedant said with a beaming smile, "Wu Qi, your sister has sent a letter to greet you! I'll read it to you." The letter was read, but not a word was mentioned about the two strings of coins.</p>
<p>By sheer coincidence, some time later, Wu Xun's relative happened to pass by and visited Wu Xun. He casually mentioned the aunt sending money through someone. Wu Xun said, "Good heavens! The master gave me the letter that day, but didn't mention any money!" Wu Xun's relative said, "He must have swallowed it! Go find him!" Hearing this, Wu Xun rushed back in a rage.</p>
<p>When Wu Xun saw the pedant, he was speechless. After a long pause, he stammered, "You…you…you swallowed the two strings of coins my sister sent. That won't do!" The pedant was engrossed in reading a copy of The Analects, but was suddenly stunned by Wu Xun's saying "swallowed," his eyes rolled upwards, and he slammed the table: "Preposterous! Who saw your sister send money?" With that, his nostrils flared, as if he were about to devour someone. Wu Xun took two steps back, helpless because he couldn't read, and the master had connections and influence. He could only suffer in silence, secretly shedding tears.</p>
<p>Time flew by, and it was almost New Year. The pedant, as usual, prepared for the holiday, writing some diamond-shaped Spring Festival couplets and ordering Wu Xun to paste them up, while he went to town to buy New Year goods. After the pedant left, a sudden gust of wind blew the couplets into a pile. Wu Xun was illiterate, so he randomly pasted them up. When the pedant returned in the evening and entered the house, he was furious and summoned Wu Xun, slapping him twice, scolding, "Are you blind? How did you paste these!" It turned out that Wu Xun had pasted "Cats and Dogs Peaceful" on the bed of the pedant and his wife, and "Family Auspiciousness" on the chicken coop. The couplets on the front and back doors had two upper lines on one side and two lower lines on the other. The rest were upside down or wrongly placed. Misplacing Spring Festival couplets was most taboo in ordinary households. The pedant's anger was no small matter. He immediately settled accounts and told Wu Xun to get out. The pedant worked the abacus and said, "Including wages and tea money, I'll deduct 20% to offset today's bad luck, leaving you with five hundred copper coins!" Wu Xun thought, "Anyway, I'm being kicked out. These few stinky coins won't make me any poorer." He raised his head and pointed at the pedant, scolding, "You swallowed my money and still want to deduct my wages. Do you have a conscience? I think these two stinky coins are dirty. Keep them to block the dog hole!" With a clatter, the coins were scattered all over the ground. Wu Xun grabbed his bundle, and without looking back, walked out, and from then on, he began his vagrant life.</p>
<p>After Wu Xun left the pedant's house, he thought: In the past, I suffered all kinds of hardships and was bullied because I was stupid, and I was stupid because I had no knowledge. Otherwise, my money wouldn't have been swallowed, and my wages wouldn't have been taken without payment. At the same time, he also thought: How many people in the world are as poor as I am and have no chance to study! Why don't I think of a way to establish a charity school to teach them to read, so they don't get cheated? But I'm a pauper, where would I get the money to run a school? He thought and thought, and decided to use his strength to do odd jobs for people, save the money he earned, and a charity school could definitely be established successfully. With that decided, he began to twist hemp threads every day, settling in a broken temple, going out to beg for food during the day, and saving every penny he got. He also composed many songs, singing to everyone he met: "Hired hands are bullied, better to beg for myself; don't look down on me for begging, sooner or later I'll build a charity school." People saw his awkward face, acting like a madman, begging everywhere, everyone thought he was crazy and ignored him, but he wasn't angry? He still sang in his mouth: "If you don't give me, I won't resent; good people will take care of my food."</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he went to beg for food and was scolded, he sang: "Grandpa and uncle, don't be angry, when you are not angry, I will leave." "Don't force, don't strengthen, don't be afraid! I beg for alms, you do good deeds, let's build a charity school together."</p>
<p>In the former Qing Dynasty, people all had queues behind their heads, but Wu Xun didn't have the time to put into braiding his queue. He shaved his head bald, leaving only a peach-shaped tuft of hair. When people laughed at him, he sang the following song for them to listen to: "Shave the left, leave the right, build a charity school, no need to worry."</p>
<p>After a few years, Wu Xun had saved ninety strings of coins, plus inherited two mu of ancestral land, which sold for one hundred and twenty strings of coins. Combined, he had two hundred and ten strings. He thought: To build a charity school, this money is far from enough! Keeping it on me isn't very safe, better to deposit it with Jinshi Lou. Master Lou is a sincere gentleman, in the future, the principal will generate interest, the interest will become principal, and the principal will generate more interest. If this continues, after a certain time, won't it be considerable? Thinking this, he sang casually: "Building a charity school, no worries, already have two hundred and ten strings." "Deposit the principal, generate interest, begging Jinshi Lou of Guantao (place name)."</p>
<p>Singing, he unknowingly arrived at Jinshi Lou's door. He knelt on both knees on the threshold and sang, "Don't want rice, don't want noodles, just beg to see Master Jinshi." The Lou family saw a mad beggar and waved him away, but Wu Xun knelt on the ground and wouldn't move, no matter how they drove him away, he refused to get up, continuing to sing: "Just beg to see Master Jinshi!" "Just beg to see Master Jinshi!"</p>
<p>The people around him found him both funny and pitiful, and gave him some food, vegetables and copper coins, but he didn't want them, insisting on making a scene until Jinshi Lou came out in person. He sang: "I beg for food, you do good deeds, take a look at the charity school I'm building." Jinshi Lou was confused and asked what he meant. He said, "I have two hundred and ten strings of coins, I want to deposit them in your house to earn interest, to be used for running a charity school." Jinshi Lou saw that he had such a good heart and agreed. He then sent two servants to fetch the two hundred and ten strings of coins and kept them for safekeeping to earn interest. From then on, Wu Xun deposited all the money he begged back with Jinshi Lou.</p>
<p>Sometimes people gave him better food, but he couldn't bear to eat it himself, and sold it to poor families, while he drank pot-washing water. When someone laughed at him, he sang: "Eating well is not enough, building a charity school is what counts." "Eating vegetable roots, eating vegetable roots, I don't need anyone for my meals; saving food, building a charity school." "Eating taro stems, eating taro stems, don't need fire, don't need water, saving money, building a charity school isn't difficult." The vegetable roots and taro stems in the garbage heap became his food.</p>
<p>His stomach was truly strange. If he couldn't beg for food or find vegetable roots and taro stems, he could fill his stomach with snakes, scorpions, broken bricks, and broken tiles. For him, it was a path to wealth. As long as you gave him money, he would eat them for you to see, and sing to you to relieve boredom: "Eating scorpions, eating scorpions, building a charity school is my business." "Snakes can be eaten, don't be afraid! Building a charity school is all my family's business." "Broken bricks and tiles, all can be digested; if I don't build a charity school, I'll be a laughingstock."</p>
<p>He also had a skill—standing a dragonfly, feet up, able to stand like that for half an hour without falling. When playing this game, he didn't need gongs or drums, he had his old tune: "Stand one, one coin, stand ten, ten coins; stand a lot, more money, who says I can't build a charity school?" As long as he was given enough money, he could crawl while standing, crawling and singing: "Crawl once, one string of coins, crawl ten times, ten strings of coins; building a charity school isn't difficult."</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Nothing is difficult in the world, only those who don't put their heart into it," Wu Xun was exactly such a person. Day after day, he saved up seven or eight thousand strings of coins. Seeing that the amount was sufficient, he went to discuss it with Jinshi Lou. As a result, he bought more than two hundred mu of land, rented it out to people to cultivate, as a constant annual expense for the future charity school. The following year, by chance, a philanthropist named Guo was willing to donate two mu of good fields as the foundation for the charity school. So Jinshi Lou came forward and used Wu Xun's money to build more than twenty tiled houses, named "Chongxian Charity School," enrolling dozens of poor children. To invite Cui Juren to be the teacher, he knelt and begged for several days, finally touching Cui Juren's heart, and he agreed. In this way, Wu Xun's wish was finally fulfilled.</p>
<p>Although Wu Xun himself was illiterate, he was very serious about the students' studies. One day, while begging for money, he passed by the charity school and took a look inside. Unexpectedly, if he hadn't looked, it would have been fine, but when he looked, he was stunned. Why? It turned out that the young students, taking advantage of the teacher's nap, had sneaked off to enjoy themselves under the shade of the trees. Some were doing somersaults, some were grabbing each other's braids and fighting. Wu Xun watched through the cracks in the door for a long time, seeing no one to stop them, and couldn't help singing: "Studying without effort, no face to see parents; studying without heart, no face to see mother!" Hearing Wu Xun's voice, the students all rushed back to their seats.</p>
<p>Wu Xun walked into the classroom, but the teacher was not there. Looking into the bedroom, Teacher Cui was snoring loudly. He silently knelt down on both knees on the ground.</p>
<p>After a while, Teacher Cui woke up, and suddenly seeing Wu Xun kneeling upright, he was very ashamed and hurried to help Wu Xun up, saying: "Mr. Wu, why do you do this? I really feel bad about it. If there is anything wrong in the future, please tell me directly." Wu Xun sang nonchalantly: "Teacher sleeping, students messing around, I come to kneel, once and for all." Cui Juren's face turned red and apologized, saying: "From now on, I will definitely be diligent and dedicated." If students didn't study hard, he would kneel in front of them and beg them. In this way, even the laziest teachers and the most mischievous students would not dare to put down their books and play again.</p>
<p>In addition to running the charity school himself, Wu Xun valued every penny, not daring to waste a single cent, but he was willing to help the poor who did well. He heard people say that there was a Zhang family daughter-in-law in the area who served her mother-in-law very filially. Once, hoping that her mother-in-law would recover from illness, she secretly cut a piece of her own flesh to make soup for her to drink. After Wu Xun knew about this, he immediately gave her ten mu of good fields, and sang to people: "This person is good, this person is good, I give her ten mu and still feel it's not enough; this person is filial, this person is filial, give her ten mu to support her old age." On the contrary, he was not willing to help his lazy elder brother at all. He said: "My business, don't interfere, brothers live separately." He never changed his mind because of his brother.</p>
<p>One day, he walked in front of a large temple. The halls inside were very grand. He thought: Leaving such a good place unused to run a charity school, but worshiping these ghostly clay statues, isn't that foolish? He knocked on the door twice: "Temple big, monks many, why not build a charity school?" This caused a group of monks to laugh. Probably they laughed too hard, and it disturbed the abbot inside, who came out to inquire. Wu Xun sang: "I beg for food, don't laugh, take a look at the charity school I'm building." The abbot asked:</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Wu, the charity school enthusiast? I've heard of you for a long time! I've heard of you for a long time!" Wu Xun quickly said, "I dare not! I dare not!" and followed the monk to the reception room.</p>
<p>This abbot had long heard of Wu Xun, and now that they met in person, he wouldn't miss the opportunity. He told Wu Xun to move to the Buddhist temple in the future, so that it would be convenient to come and go and rest. Wu Xun readily agreed. He lived in the temple for more than a year. The abbot donated all his savings of more than two thousand strings of coins to Wu Xun to run the charity school. Truly, sincerity moves everything.</p>
<p>His singing was very effective. Many people were moved by him, some giving money, some giving food and vegetables. He tied the money together with rope, sold the food and vegetables to others, and tied the money he sold them for together, counted the numbers, and sent them to Jinshi Lou's house, and then returned to the broken temple to be a partner with the clay Bodhisattva. He could adapt to please people. Once, he came out of the broken temple and just reached the temple gate when a broken tile from the corner of the roof fell and hit him on the head, and blood flowed straight down. He didn't care and covered the wound with a pinch of incense ash, and then he sang: "Breaking my head, venting the fire, building a charity school is all on me." The listeners almost laughed until their backs hurt. At daybreak, he left the broken temple and went out to beg for food again.</p>
<p>He had many ways to make money. Whenever he had free time, he would help people do odd jobs, regardless of sweeping manure, hoeing grass, or pushing the mill. Others worked for a fixed time, but he kept working until dark before stopping. He often sang like this: "Removing manure, hoeing grass, pushing the mill, come find me, no matter how dark, no matter how much money." "Pushing the mill, pushing the mill, sixty he for a dou of wheat, no matter the grinding or the sifting, money for sifting is even more." He usually held the attitude that he would laugh and scold at others, as long as you give money, he was willing to be spat on the face: "Charity school enthusiast, no temper, greets people with courtesy; money in hand, life is alive, building a charity school will last for ten thousand years."</p>
<p>Wu Xun's fame for begging for food and building schools spread day by day. Almost everyone in Shandong province knew about it. Later, even the governor knew about it and busily sent someone to summon him. Sure enough, his reputation was well-deserved, crazy and crazy: "I'm not crazy, I'm not sick, I only have a charity school disease." He kept singing. When the governor visited the charity school, the results were not bad, so he prepared a memorial to request the court to commend him.</p>
<p>One day, Wu Xun was begging for food outside when he suddenly saw an official sedan chair approaching from afar. He thought that there must be a great official sitting in the sedan chair. Not to be missed, he threw down his broken bowl and dog-beating stick, and knelt down on both knees on the ground. He opened his throat to sing.</p>
<p>Seeing someone kneeling in front of him, the sedan chair carrier thought it was someone filing a lawsuit and shouted, "Listen, kneeling on the ground, Vice Minister Yu is here. If you have a grievance or a lawsuit, you can tell the truth!" Wu Xun sang: "No lawsuit, no complaint, building a charity school is what I'm good at, great lord, donate some money to help!" Vice Minister Yu thought: This person is very strange, could he be the charity school enthusiast Wu Xun? He asked, "Are you Wu Qi?" Wu Xun said, "I am." Vice Minister Yu said, "Good! I will donate to the charity school soon." Wu Xun crawled on the ground and kowtowed, happily walking away.</p>
<p>After some time, he suddenly received an imperial decree, conferring Wu Xun as "Charity School Administrator," bestowing a yellow jacket, and awarding a plaque with "Loves to Do Good" written on it, to be hung in the charity school, what glory! But Wu Xun didn't find it strange at all. He sang casually: "Charity school enthusiast, no need to be conferred! Yellow jacket, no use! Building a charity school will last for ten thousand years." He still lived his begging life.</p>
<p>Someone advised him to marry a wife, so that he could have descendants in the future, but he always shook his head: "Don't marry a wife, don't have children, building a charity school is selfless." Until his death, he remained a bachelor. He often used this song to express his ambition: "Life is rare at seventy, fifty-three years old and not married, relatives and friends are all dead, in the end, only the charity school disease." He also saw the issue of life and death very calmly. He sang: "Die on the road, bury on the road, die in the street, bury in the street, there will naturally be a coffin when you die."</p>
<p>He died in the twenty-second year of Guangxu—he lived to be fifty-nine years old. His entire estate was these three charity schools he founded, and nothing else. On the day of his funeral, there were more than 10,000 people to see him off, many of whom were students from the charity school. All of them were crying bitterly, lamenting and praising him! His bones were buried next to the charity school. Even now, those broken baskets and broken bowls—his relics, and the charity school he founded, are still well preserved in Linqing County, Shandong!</p>
<h3>Otto Bismarck</h3>
<p>— Yun Bo</p>
<p>Bismarck was the hero who created Germany. Although some say he advocated autocracy, promoted militarism, and was a troublemaker, his perseverance and planning are worthy of our admiration; his achievements and aspirations are worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>In the past, when Germany was not yet unified, there were many small states of the German nation, which organized a federal government. This federal government was dominated by Austria, but Austria was not of the same ethnicity as them.</p>
<p>Among these many federations, there was a larger kingdom called Prussia. Bismarck was a Prussian. He was born into the aristocracy, and in his youth, he was very dissolute, disregarding etiquette, fond of drinking, and often engaged in duels; sometimes he practiced shooting, and the booming of gunfire never stopped all day long; his neighbors all hated him and called him "Riotous Young Master." But after his father died, he was sad day and night, not showing any signs of wildness. This shows that he had passionate feelings and a sincere personality; he was truly a heroic figure.</p>
<p>When he was studying at school, he liked to study history and geography very much. When he read history and talked about the situation in which France had ravaged Prussia in the past, he wanted to avenge himself. He saw in history that any country with a mixed race would eventually split up, so he wanted to exclude Austria and let Prussia lead this German federation of the same race. He saw geographically that any country with a system of construction would eventually dissolve, so he wanted to unify the various federations and create a united and strong country. These few points of view were the goals of his lifelong efforts.</p>
<p>He paid close attention to the international situation. When he traveled to England and France, he often paid attention to examining the politics of various countries and studied them very carefully. He even carefully explored the temperament of the French Emperor. He saw the corruption of Austrian politics and the mediocrity of its ministers, and he was confident that his aspirations would definitely be successful. When he was the envoy to Russia, he felt that among the European countries, only Russia could be an assistant, and his foreign policy was to contact Russia in everything. He had very precise preparations for his life's work.</p>
<p>At that time, King William I of Prussia was thinking of unifying the federation and making Prussia the leader of the federation. He prepared to reform the military system, expand military preparations, and actively increase military strength. However, the parliament did not approve of this move and vehemently opposed it. The King of Prussia felt that there was no way, so he appointed Bismarck as Prime Minister to confront the parliament.</p>
<p>Because Bismarck was a descendant of the aristocracy, he had an arrogant personality and developed the idea of autocracy and reverence for the king. He believed that in Prussia at that time, only by acting arbitrarily could he freely use his means to achieve the goal of unifying the federation, and the parliament and constitution were enough to hinder his policy of advancing bravely. After he became Prime Minister, he dismissed all the civil and military officials who opposed the reform of the military system; and decided to dissolve the parliament. Everything the government wanted to do, such as expanding military preparations, reforming the military system, and increasing military spending, was immediately implemented. He said to the representatives of the people: "At present, various problems can only be solved with iron and blood." From then on, everyone called him the "Iron and Blood Chancellor."</p>
<p>At this time, the people of the whole country hated him because he excluded civil rights, dismissed the parliament, and prohibited freedom of speech and publication, and regarded him as an enemy. However, Bismarck had a broad vision and a firm ambition, and he did not care about the opposition of the people, but only tried his best to implement his plans. He believed that in that scattered situation, nothing could be accomplished without being strong and capable; he also believed that his actions were beneficial to the German nation and not for his own self-interest. In the future, when he succeeded, the people would always understand him. Therefore, with the spirit of sacrificing himself for the country, he tried his best to do the great cause of unifying the federation.</p>
<p>Although some people wanted to assassinate him, he was still not afraid. He said: "To make the people happy, just hang me. But I still want to unify Germany and make Germany rich and strong, so I can't die yet. After a few more years, when my policy is successful, the people will definitely welcome me!"</p>
<p>The first time he implemented the "Iron and Blood Policy" was to go to war with Denmark. He deliberately made an alliance with Austria, so that Austria could not unite with other countries, and he could also use this to test Austria's military strength. How far-reaching his intentions were!</p>
<p>When Prussia defeated Denmark and signed a treaty with Austria, it deliberately competed with Austria for rights, arousing Austria's anger. As a result, it went to war with Austria and easily defeated Austria. The goal of excluding Austria was achieved.</p>
<p>Prussia won two consecutive victories, and its national power gradually became stronger. This made the French Emperor very jealous, and finally he went to war with France again. In the war, he used swift means to capture the French capital, Paris. William I was crowned emperor of the German Federation in Paris. All the federations were afraid of Prussia's power and expressed their willingness to obey the command of the Prussian Emperor. Bismarck's ambition of unification, which he had accumulated for several years, was finally successful.</p>
<p>Although Bismarck advocated the Iron and Blood Policy, his policy changed after the unification of Germany. He had previously advocated dictatorship, but now he followed the trend of the world and advocated national socialism; respected freedom, valued civil rights, established a constitution, opened a parliament, revised the new criminal law, promoted free trade, and worked hard to improve industry. He worked hard to do construction work to consolidate the foundation of the country. Under his guidance, Germany gradually became prosperous and became a strong country in Europe.</p>
<p>Bismarck had a majestic appearance, a vibrant spirit, a strong physique, worked diligently, was very willing to take responsibility, and had a firm will, dared to act and dared to do, and was not afraid of difficulties and all obstacles. His perseverance is very admirable. Although he was so decisive, he planned very carefully beforehand. When he encountered something, he must first carefully examine its appearance, and then carefully examine its results. If there is danger, he must carefully measure the size of the danger and calculate how to prevent that danger. He would never do anything inappropriate, and the policies he implemented never failed.</p>
<p>He did not like war, because war is always dangerous. After the unification of Germany, he never used the "Iron and Blood Policy." Whenever the friendship between the two countries could be maintained with difficulty and there was no need to use force, he would never easily go to war with others. The several battles he fought were all unavoidable, and they were decided only after decades of calm consideration. He once said: "We cannot see the cards that God is playing." Although he was very confident of winning, he was still often afraid of failure. If we say that he is rude and dissolute, and likes to be ambitious and greedy for success, then we have misunderstood his personality.</p>
<p>Later, Bismarck resigned and retired because of disagreements with the new emperor, William II. At that time, he was already seventy-five years old. When he was sitting alone in a carriage and was about to leave the German capital, Berlin, many people on the side of the road presented him with flower wreaths. The sound of praise and blessings was like thunder. Bismarck got out of the car at that time and said goodbye to them. The people surrounded him and cheered. Bismarck was moved to tears, and the people also sadly wept and saw him off. What Bismarck had said before was indeed fulfilled. How much the people love him now!</p>

<h3>Jane Eyre's Autobiography (3)</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Written by Ms. C. Bronte of England, translated by Li Jiye, published by the Life Bookstore World Literature Series</p>
<p>Jane Eyre's talents are multifaceted (she is good at painting, especially talkative, which made her master secretly fall in love with her). Her personality is extremely rebellious and has a firm sense of autonomy. Rochester is more than twice Jane Eyre's age and is not a very handsome man (although Jane Eyre herself is not considered beautiful). The classes of the two are also very far apart, and there is no possibility of love between them. However, after a long time of confiding in each other, Jane Eyre's small and pure heart was secretly engraved with a small shadow of the strong and eccentric male Rochester.</p>
<p>One night, when Jane Eyre had not yet fallen asleep, she heard footsteps, secretly got up to track them, and found someone setting a fire to burn Rochester to death. She secretly saved him again. Rochester told her not to publicize it, and he left the next day. Soon after, he brought many distinguished guests (including many noble ladies and beautiful young ladies) and lingered in Thornfield for a long time. There was once a rumor that Rochester was going to marry the aristocratic Miss Ingram.</p>
<p>Miss Ingram lived in Thornfield Manor for a long time, and they played many of the pastimes that nobles often play, such as singing, hunting, dancing, and playing cards, etc. Of course, Jane Eyre was not included in these, because Jane Eyre was just a humble nanny. Miss Ingram often showed a contemptuous attitude towards Jane Eyre and Adela, and became more and more intimate with Rochester day by day.</p>
<p>Rochester was really strange. He suddenly disguised himself as an old witch and began to tell fortunes for all the nobles and even the people living in his mansion. No one knew that he was Rochester, because a few days ago he had announced that he was going out to prepare for the wedding. Finally, he told Jane Eyre's fortune and revealed his true form.</p>
<p>Later, the two of them secretly did something to save his friend Mason from being bitten and stabbed by a madman, and the two of them became more spiritually compatible.</p>
<p>Miss Ingram was willing to marry Rochester only to get half of his property. Later, there was a rumor that he did not have much property and was in debt, so the marriage contract was broken. Rochester once said this to Jane Eyre:</p>
<p>"I pretended to court Miss Ingram because I wanted you to love me as crazily as I love you; and I knew that to promote this purpose, jealousy was the best ally I could ask for." - Page 241</p>
<p>The wedding proceeded smoothly. When Rochester and Jane Eyre announced their marriage, everyone was very surprised and thought that this combination was extremely inappropriate. Sure enough, good things take time. When a pastor was invited to take the oath in the cathedral, several people who disrupted the wedding suddenly appeared from the guests who were watching the ceremony. One was the lawyer Brookley, who was asked by Jane Eyre's uncle, Mr. Eyre, to come out to stop this false marriage; the other was Mason, who had been bitten and stabbed by a madman in Thornfield. The reason they stopped was that Rochester had already been married, and the bride was Mason's sister. And it was proved that Rochester's wife was still alive and still in Thornfield Manor.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea Experiments</p>
<h3>New Approaches to Treating Gonorrhea by Scholars from Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Statistics of individual clinical cases - Several points to pay attention to in anti-gonorrhea therapy</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the failure of local membrane sterilization treatment of gonorrhea, scholars from various countries have buried themselves in research, hoping to obtain the latest and most reliable treatment methods. As a result, various gonorrhea preparations have emerged endlessly. To find a medicine that is effective, powerful, and of royal quality is as rare as a phoenix feather. Generally, they are only slightly improved based on old treatment methods, such as still relying on the pharmacology of membrane sterilization and pairing it with blood cleansing or diuretic effects. The ingredients of these drugs are nothing more than musk oil, cubeb, etc. After taking them, the side effects are very large, such as stimulating the kidneys and causing uremia. Therefore, the saying that there is no cure for gonorrhea seems to have become a conclusion. For gonorrhea patients, it is no different from being sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<p>In recent years, our medical community has suddenly discovered a surprising piece of news, that is, a new realm has been opened up in the treatment of gonorrhea. The special medicine for gonorrhea, "Clinon", has been successfully created. According to reports from Professor Weichardt and Dr. Virchow, the method of increasing white blood cells in gonorrhea is a shortcut to resist and eliminate systemic gonococci and cure them forever. "Clinon" has a great effect on increasing white blood cells, and it does not have any drawbacks and does not hinder the stomach and intestines. Therefore, it is appreciated by scholars from various countries. Dr. Heilfieber and Mr. Peter, the inventor of "Clinon", both have various most statistically significant reports on the treatment of gonorrhea. Since I stayed in Russia and used this medicine, the cases of male acute urethral gonorrhea and chronic prostatitis and orchitis that I have treated have all achieved complete cure in more than 95% of the cases. Even if they drink alcohol or work hard, they will not relapse. In addition to taking "Clinon" for leukorrhea and uterine inflammation in women's gonorrhea, "Karal Cedi" is also used externally as a suppository, treating both sides at the same time, so the cure is even faster. About 98 out of 100 people are cured. The dosage is about 5 to 9 or 10 bottles to achieve complete success!</p>
<h3>Female Insomnia and Menstruation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Menstrual diseases can stimulate nerves and cause insomnia; sleep deprivation can also make menstruation difficult</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "It is better to treat ten men than one woman," because women often avoid seeking medical treatment. For example, if a woman has neurasthenia, she often cannot fall asleep. Ovarian function is abnormal, which makes menstruation irregular, and then all kinds of diseases arise. Moreover, if a woman's menstruation is irregular, it is difficult to have the hope of reproduction. Women who suffer from insomnia and menstrual difficulties must have weak bodies, weak limbs, wrinkles on their foreheads, prominent cheekbones, thin faces, haggardness, lower back pain, and leukorrhea. Even if they take menstrual-regulating and sleeping pills all day long, it is still difficult to achieve success. This disease must have a sedative nerve, promote follicle-stimulating hormone, and adjust menstruation before it can be called a radical cure.</p>
<p>"Bu Nu Rong" has special effects on the above-mentioned symptoms. This tablet is made of female hormones. It is used to resist and increase the lack of endocrine in various parts and make up for it. Therefore, all symptoms of menstrual disorder and insomnia can be completely cured in a short period of time. Moreover, after recovery, the spirit is lively, and the complexion is delicate and moving. There is Mrs. Liang Zhiyun, who lives on Pushi Road, who has also suffered from menstrual disorder and insomnia for a long time. After taking "Bu Nu Rong", her menstruation was adjusted in only five weeks, and she recovered her original health. It is easy to conceive after menstruation is regulated. Therefore, the medicine "Bu Nu Rong" has long been famous all over the world. If it were not for its remarkable efficacy, how could it have achieved this?</p>

<p>Treatment of Gonorrhea That Is Most Likely to Recur</p>
<p>If gonorrhea is not cured, recurrence is inevitable. Every time it recurs, the gonorrhea toxin penetrates deeper once. The one that is most likely to recur is paraurethritis. Originally, our paraurethra is located near the external urethral orifice, and its hole is extremely small, about the size of a needle hole, but the paraurethral tube is deep and long. This physiological condition is suitable for cunning gonococci to survive latently; Generally, the formation of gonococcal paraurethritis is mostly due to the fact that patients with urethral gonorrhea have lost treatment over time. Or by a doctor who is not skilled in surgery, when performing urethral irrigation, gonococci take the opportunity to sneak in, and then lurk and multiply, waiting for an opportunity to cause trouble. Whenever they encounter drinking alcohol, sexual intercourse, strenuous exercise, or fatigue, they will rise up and move, but after a little recuperation, they will still lurk. If this goes on and on, it will eventually lead to urethral swelling and pain, and pus will accumulate and turn into an abscess. Therefore, it damages the excretion of urine and the ejaculation after sexual intercourse. Paraurethritis is enough to make one suffer from its pain for the rest of one's life, and there is a risk of cutting off the inheritance.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to avoid gonorrhea that is difficult to eradicate and prone to recurrence, it is necessary to radically cure paraurethritis. Mr. Zhou Xunqi, who lives in Baxianqiao, had gonorrhea from time to time. His urethra was swollen, and it was difficult to prevent urine ejaculation. After I treated him with electricity and X-rays, I also gave him "Clinon" to resist gonorrhea and kill bacteria, so that all the gonococci lurking in the deep part were swept away. After a total of five weeks of medication and three follow-up visits, the effect of complete eradication was achieved. After using blood serum tests six or seven times, there was no gonorrhea detected once. Then it proves radical cure. His wife also took "Clinon" internally and used "Karal Cedi's vaginal tablets" externally as a sitting leaf to remove leukorrhea, and recovered in three weeks. They have lived together until now and already have two sons.</p>
<h3>100 Questions About Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, Dr. Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road; Clinic hours: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>2. Why is quiet therapy effective for tuberculosis?</p>
<p>Quiet therapy is a necessary means to cure pulmonary tuberculosis. The scope of quietness is very broad, the main ones being mental quietness and physical quietness. Physical quietness only makes the lungs quiet, so the quietness of the lungs is very important. The artificial pneumothorax, thoracoplasty, and phrenic nerve resection that are popular in the world today are all aimed at stopping the respiratory movement of the affected lung to promote the mechanism of cure. After the lung is eroded by tuberculosis bacteria, it will become inflamed, ulcerated, and rotten. Although the lesions have different sizes, they must be healed to be cured. Therefore, whether it is early or severe pulmonary tuberculosis, the first priority is the quietness of the lungs. Surgical treatments such as thoracoplasty all have certain indications and are not suitable for ordinary people. Therefore, pulmonary disease specialists all emphasize drug treatment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, lung treatment preparations are nothing more than increasing nutrition, stopping bleeding and coughs, and can only treat the symptoms but not the root cause. Only the newly invented "Bu Fei Nare" not only has the power to strengthen the whole body, but also can reduce the respiratory function of the affected lung and get rest. It can also reduce the blood flow and lymphatic flow of the affected lung to reduce the spread of bacteria and toxins throughout the body. On the one hand, it also prevents the breeding of tuberculosis. Therefore, the cough with phlegm, hemoptysis, chest pain, tidal fever, emaciation, night sweats, and weakness of pulmonary tuberculosis can be completely cured in about one or two months. For pulmonary tuberculosis's neurasthenia, insomnia, palpitations, male impotence, premature ejaculation, back pain, kidney deficiency. Women's menstrual irregularities, pain during menstruation, etc., can take "Bu Fei Nare" at the same time as "Bu Ti Kang" for men to nourish the kidneys and body, or "Bu Nu Rong" for women to regulate menstruation and nourish the brain. If a man has nocturnal emission, he can take "Nai Er Si's Nocturnal Emission Tablets" again; if a woman also has leukorrhea, she can also use "Karal Cedi" externally as a suppository. With such thorough consideration, there is no one who will not be cured soon!</p>
<p>Talking About Nocturnal Emission Pills</p>
<h3>Two Reasons for Semen Loss</h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>The result of masturbation and self-torture: The cause of congenital deficiency:</p>
<p>Clinic: Across from Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Semen loss refers to nocturnal emission. There are different levels of nocturnal emission. The lighter one is dream emission (emission with a dream), and then there is dreamless nocturnal emission. In severe cases, there is spermatorrhea during the day, or semen leakage (slipping out during exertion or urination). There are two reasons for this symptom: either masturbation during the pre-youth development period, which damages the central nerve of sexuality; or congenital deficiency, lack of hormones, and the vas deferens loses its control ability. The treatment method must be to collect the vas deferens, calm the central nerve of ejaculation, and promote hormone function, so taking "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to calm the central nerve and collect the vas deferens is the most appropriate. And it is better to take "Bu Ti Kang" at the same time to promote hormone function.</p>
<p>For nocturnal emission caused by masturbation, masturbation must be stopped. Old semen-consolidating medicines do not have the effect of stopping masturbation, but "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" can calm the brain. It strengthens the will, so after taking it, masturbation will stop naturally, and symptoms such as nocturnal emission, sperm leakage, and spermatorrhea will also be treated together. For brain weakness, dizziness, forgetfulness, and insomnia caused by nocturnal emission, you can also take "Bu Ti Kang" to restore weakness. If nocturnal emission is caused by lung disease, you can also take "Bu Fei Nare" to reduce tuberculosis and nourish the lungs, treating both the symptoms and the root cause, and achieve great results.</p>
<h3>Gastroenteritis Popular After Autumn Coolness</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Patients with chronic indigestion should pay more attention!</p>
<p>Among the popular diseases in autumn, gastroenteritis ranks first. A casual chill during sleep and inadvertently ingesting spoiled food can often cause indigestion. The contents of the stomach and intestines ferment and cause inflammation. As a result, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting of acid water, heaviness in the head, headache, fever, and lack of appetite occur. According to my clinical experiments, taking the special medicine for indigestion, "Qiang Wei Jing," is the most effective. This medicine can clear the spoiled substances in the stomach, eliminate the fermentation in the intestines, and reduce its congestion symptoms. It can be completely relieved in a short period of time and avoid other dangerous symptoms such as dysentery.</p>
<p>When gastroenteritis turns into chronic, there will be symptoms such as dull stomach, stomach stagnation, loss of appetite, fullness in the chest and diaphragm, noisy stomach, vomiting belching, acid reflux, heart and stomach pain, as well as indigestion, constipation, or diarrhea and watery stools with rapid intestinal peristalsis, and loose stools due to slow absorption of the intestinal wall. "Qiang Wei Jing" contains enzymes and spleen elements, which have great power to correct gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, after taking three or four bottles or seven or eight bottles, even long-term chronic diseases can be cured suddenly. This medicine is also very suitable for infants with milk vomiting and green stools. It is also good at treating beriberi, which lacks vitamin B, because "Qiang Wei Jing" also contains a large amount of vitamin B. Its character is of royal quality and pure, which is really unmatched by other preparations.</p>
<h3>Standard Endocrine Preparation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Kunhe, Japanese Imperial Medical University</p>
<p>Based on restoring sexual tissue function as a condition</p>
<p>Endocrine therapy has made great progress since Berthold and Brewn Sepuard invented and laid the foundation. However, its complete success is still far away. In the past, I didn’t know how to thoroughly transform sexual tissues. Therefore, success was half and failure was half. It was not until the appearance of the German Melen that the final success was achieved. At the beginning of his research on these therapies, Melen selected strong animals in their youth, took the most suitable ones, and extracted their youth glands for long-term research and improvement. Only then did he succeed in the two medicines "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women that are popular today. First, he tested aging animals, and the results were satisfactory; then he tried patients whose sexual tissues were destroyed by masturbation, early marriage, and excessive sexual desire. In a short period of time, the sexual tissue was observed under a microscope and fully restored to health. Therefore, male nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation are quickly cured. At the same time, sexual organ development is incomplete, and symptoms such as dwarfism also have normal development. If sexual tissue is not healthy, development in various parts cannot reach normal development. At the same time, symptoms such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and weak erection are difficult to achieve radical cure. This is really a new discovery in endocrine therapy. The two medicines "Bu Ti Kang" and "Bu Nu Rong" are also standard endocrine preparations. When I was in Tokyo, I already knew the great efficacy of this medicine. Since returning to China, in clinical experiments, I have cured nearly two or three thousand men with short lower parts, nocturnal emission, and neurasthenia, and women with menstrual irregularities and flat breasts and buttocks like men. In addition to supplementing endocrine and correcting sexual tissue function, long-term use also has the effect of curing diseases and staying young.</p>

<h3>White Discharge Can Cause Infertility</h3>
<p>— Doctor Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>Childhood Blindness – The Fault Lies with the Mother.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten women's illnesses are related to white discharge. This is because women are often too ashamed to seek treatment, unaware that moist areas are breeding grounds for bacteria. We often see women suffering from unexplained uterine bleeding, which is simply due to bacterial infection. Especially when a husband has a history of gonorrhea, it can lead to gonorrheal endometritis, oophoritis, and Bartholin's gland inflammation, and the resulting secretions are white discharge. This type of white discharge is highly toxic. If a newborn passes through the birth canal during delivery and accidentally gets this substance into their eyes, the child is at risk of blindness within a few hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, the disease of white discharge in women may seem minor on the surface, but the danger it poses is truly terrifying. Currently, the most effective suppository for treating white discharge is the "Carter's Snow Earth Vaginal Tablet." This tablet has bactericidal, anti-secretory, and antiseptic properties, without any adverse side effects. Each time, before going to bed, insert one tablet into the vagina as a suppository. It will dissolve by the next morning. However, if the white discharge is caused by gonorrhea, it is also necessary to take "Klinon" internally to eliminate deep-seated gonococci. If white discharge causes difficult menstruation or cessation of fertility, in addition to using this tablet, it is advisable to also take "Bu Nü Rong" to achieve faster results. I often introduce this method to women with white discharge, instructing them to treat themselves at home, and have often achieved unexpected results. The number of those cured is no less than several thousand.</p>
<h3>Acute Gonorrheal Urethral Swelling</h3>
<p>— Doctor Song Zhongyu, Graduate of Army Medical University</p>
<p>Almost Leading to Inability to Urinate and Uremia</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Zhu Shounan, resides in a certain lane on Avenue Edward VII. This spring, he attended a banquet with friends, where a beautiful woman entertained with wine. As the banquet drew to a close, Mr. Zhu excused himself to return home, but in reality, he went straight to her boudoir. As a result, he contracted gonorrhea, and the urethral mucosa became inflamed and swollen, almost completely closing off the urethra (as shown in Figure A). This caused extreme difficulty in urination, with frequent discharge of pus, unbearable pain, and sleepless nights spent groaning in agony. Furthermore, the inability to urinate led to symptoms of uremia. Although he had purchased and taken gonorrhea medications such as membrane-penetrating bactericides, they proved ineffective. Later, through a friend's introduction, he came to me for treatment. After first disinfecting and cleaning the pus, I immediately administered German "Klinon" to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. I also induced a systemic anti-gonorrheal effect to prevent the gonococci from spreading to other parts of the body and causing complications. After two weeks of continuous treatment, Mr. Zhu's swelling and pain had subsided by seventy to eighty percent, and his condition had greatly improved. He continued to take the medication for another ten days or so, and the swelling and pain in the urethral mucosa completely subsided, restoring it to its original healthy state (as shown in Figure B). The excruciating acute gonorrhea was completely cured. This is an example of "Klinon" curing acute gonorrhea. Furthermore, it has special efficacy for chronic leukorrhea and various complications of leukorrhea. This medicine is made from a mixture of yellow pigment and protein, and its efficacy surpasses any other gonorrhea medication.</p>

<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines have been carefully formulated by specialist university doctors both at home and abroad. Be sure to recognize and purchase them. Do not be misled by the words of others and mistakenly purchase miscellaneous brand cheap inferior drugs, to avoid causing life-threatening dangers after taking them.</p>
<p>Debility</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Chaojun: For kidney weakness, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, forgetfulness, nocturnal emission, and sexual underdevelopment, take "Bu Ti Kang" to supplement hormones, restore development, and also take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to astringe the spermatic ducts and stop nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>Bone Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Hua Yunyou: You have suffered from chronic gonorrheal discharge, painful urination, and morning urethral sealing. Recently, you have also experienced aching bones all over your body, which is gonorrheal arthritis. Please seek treatment from Doctor Yao Juyan as soon as possible. Before the diagnosis, take "Klinon" to resist and eliminate systemic gonorrheal toxins, which may also lead to complete recovery.</p>
<p>White Discharge</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Meilin: For persistent white discharge, kidney deficiency, abdominal distension, irregular menstruation, and abdominal cough, use "Carter's Snow Earth" externally as a suppository, and also take "Bu Nü Rong" internally to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body, and "Bu Fei Na Er" to replenish the lungs for immediate recovery.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Implements Anti-Gambling and Anti-Smoking Policies</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The biggest evils in Guangdong Province are smoking and gambling, and the people suffer the most from them. When Chen Jitang left, his private property totaled several tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars in cash, several tens of millions of dollars in assets, and real estate worth no less than several tens of millions of dollars. The total amount Chen Jitang had amassed in Guangdong over the years was almost incalculable. Although this wealth may not have been entirely derived from smoking and gambling, a large portion of it certainly was.</p>
<p>What did the people of Guangdong do to deserve this torment? They were ruined and impoverished, becoming as thin and gaunt as jackals. Although everyone knows the harm of smoking and gambling, the people of Guangdong themselves do not know how to cherish themselves and willingly throw themselves into the net, reaping what they sow, so what else is there to say? The love of good things is inherent in everyone, and the enjoyment of comfort is sweet to all. If the government uses this to tempt people, how can people restrain themselves? As a result, every drop of the local people's lifeblood flows into Chen's pocket.</p>
<p>Addiction to smoking and gambling leads to the abandonment of everything else, leaving one bedridden, turning day into night, shouting and gambling, emptying coffers and baskets, and then regretting it, but it is already too late. Therefore, the harm of smoking and gambling is that, in small terms, it is enough to ruin families and lives, and in large terms, it is enough to destroy countries and extinguish races. Consider what kind of country our nation is in now, and what kind of countries other nations are in now. Countries like Germany and Italy promote eugenics, and people who are disabled, weak, or ill are not only forbidden to marry but are also sterilized. Why? Because in the current world of survival of the fittest, there is no room for the disabled, weak, or ill among the people.</p>
<p>Now, if ordinary outstanding and promising citizens of our country become addicted to bad habits, they become like useless people. If they are immersed in gambling, they ignore everything else. What benefit do such people bring to the country? They cause the nation to become increasingly degenerate. If a nation in this state wants to resist the great powers, it will only be eliminated and trampled upon. Therefore, after our central government unified Guangdong Province, it first banned smoking and gambling to eliminate the great evils of the people of Guangdong and to strengthen the country, which is why the people of Guangdong are raising their hands, shedding tears, and celebrating endlessly.</p>
<p>According to recent news from Hong Kong, Guangdong will implement a ban on gambling on September 1st. All legitimate and illegal gambling dens in the province will close by the 31st night, resulting in the unemployment of over 100,000 people. Smoking will be banned in 29 years, and drugs will be banned in 25 years. The reason why smoking and gambling are so prevalent in Guangdong Province is simply because those at the top advocate it, and those at the bottom readily follow. If this continues for a few more years, the chances of the people of Guangdong not having all their property taken by Chen alone will be slim. Therefore, Chen's presence was the misfortune of the people of Guangdong, and Chen's inability to maintain his position for long and his forced departure now is the great fortune of the people of Guangdong.</p>
<p>The implementation of the ban on gambling has resulted in the unemployment of as many as 100,000 people, which seems to be a cause for concern for these people. However, those who rely solely on gambling for a living are generally loafers and idlers, and bandits and rogues with no regular occupations. They originally relied on gambling because they were unemployed, and they are definitely not unemployed because of gambling. These gamblers are originally figures from vocational training centers for vagrants, and the result will only be to drive them into vocational training centers. There is no need to worry about them.</p>
<p>Correction: In the third paragraph of yesterday's "Talk," the three words "still not" were omitted after "and it is killing humanely."</p>
<h3>At the Ancient City Wall</h3>
<p>— Xia Ying</p>
<p>Facing the scenery of this ancient city, he began to exclaim. "This lovely, quiet southern city!" he murmured. I watched his expression; this time, I even discovered his poetic emotions. Isn't it a strange thing? Such a gentle and polite young man fighting to the death in the artillery fire! I couldn't help but ask him why he joined the army; and his thoughts on the battlefield. After hearing my questions, he laughed, reached out and patted my shoulder, and said:</p>
<p>"How can I answer your questions? You are too young now, you won't understand. I can only tell you that I joined the army for a living! A person always has to find a bowl of rice to eat; isn't going to war the same principle? Although, when the country really needs me, when I have to resist foreign powers, then I am fulfilling a citizen's duty! On the battlefield, I feel that if one day the muzzles of our millions of brothers are aimed outwards, then even if I am crushed to pieces, it is what I desire! But now, every time I go to the battlefield, I feel an unspeakable pain..."</p>
<p>"Yes, Company Commander Fang, if the muzzles are aimed outwards, I would be willing to go to war with you," I said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Really? That's great!" he said excitedly, and patted my back again. "You are still young, study hard, and there will always be a chance for you to participate in resisting foreign powers... Listen, that pockmarked bugler is blowing the assembly call again, let's go back."</p>
<p>A series of chaotic bugle calls sounded, and we got up and walked down the city wall.</p>
<p>Company Commander Fang was transferred not long after. Our parting did not involve any sorrow or attachment, but he did reveal a kind of indescribable melancholy for this ancient city, as if he was infinitely regretful. Autumn was already deep, and the wind was very cold. I just repeatedly told him to take care...</p>
<p>This was my impression of the seventh autumn – the last autumn – in that ancient city. On a day when a fierce north wind was blowing, and the sky was gray and cold, I said goodbye to my home and embarked on my long journey. One year, two years, three years... The memory of the ancient city wall gradually faded away in the torrent of life. Now that another autumn has arrived, it truly evokes endless emotion.</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Fang Zong</p>
<p>At night, as soon as it gets dark, there are unusually few pedestrians on the road. Only soldiers with bayonets hanging from their waists run and laugh in groups of two or three. Some are drunk, and some harass women on the road. In the desolate streets and alleys, only crisp footsteps sound heavily, and that heavy sound strikes people's hearts again and again. Few "Chinese" are seen, especially women.</p>
<p>I sat at home, chatting with an old neighbor. In front of the dim oil lamp, he—this businessman who was no longer young—excitedly, yet cautiously, lowered his voice and spoke to me.</p>
<p>"Why did you come back here?" His tone carried a hint of complaint.</p>
<p>"How can I not come back? This is my home. I want to see everything in my home!"</p>
<p>"Ah, home, do you still have a home? Can your home still live here? I advise you, you should quickly move your entire family to Guannei, Beiping, Tianjin—oh, no, I heard those places aren't good either. You should still move to the south, Shanghai, Guangdong!" He took a puff of smoke, "It's a pity I don't have money, and my store is closed. If I can raise enough for travel expenses, I will definitely move, move to Guannei..."</p>
<p>"Don't be sad. Slowly, we will always guard our home and drive out the ××s!" I comforted him, while encouraging him and myself in this way.</p>
<p>Slowly! Slowly until when? Until when will we guard? Don't you know that we Chinese are no longer having a good life here. They are taking everything's livelihood…</p>
