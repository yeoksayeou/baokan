<p>— 棠</p>
<p>豐台為平南之小鎭，地屬北平特別市，以出產花，菓，菜蔬等類，聞名平津一帶。自白堅武叛變事起，「友邦」駐軍佔領倉庫，建築兵營，舉行層出不窮之演習，本年一再發生中日雙方駐軍之誤會事件，而「九一八」夜震動一時之中日兩軍誤會事件又起。於是此蕞爾小鎭，乃以「是非窠」之名，而著名全國矣。然實際上，此實平津間之咽喉，此而迤西，以迄平漢路上之蘆溝橋，同為「友邦」駐軍之軍事重心地帶。鐵路經此者，有北寗路，及由北平至蘆溝橋之支綫。鎭雖小，而形勢重要特甚。「九一八」夜之誤會事件和解後，我方　十九軍駐軍之一部，已自該鎭撤退；故近十餘日來，該地地方情形，已成為一班社會人士關心之鵠的。</p>
<p>豐台距北平正陽門約二十公里，中國里的四十餘里，快車半小時可達，慢車則沿途共有四站。依次為北平之正陽門，東便鬥，永定鬥，以迄豐台，車須二小時以上始達。記者於下午一時由正陽門站乘北寗二十三次平榆快車前往，沿途風和日麗，高梁叢搖曳不已，彌望者一遍赭黃。間有屋角泥牆透出之處，則必有大學眼藥，老篤眼藥，味　素，胃活，仁丹，中將湯，宏興鷓鴣菜，等類之廣告在焉。此類廣告，排列異常整齊，由正陽門至豐台之四五十里間，各種廣告，在鄕村之牆壁屋角上，輪流出　，無擁擠亦無脫漏現象。意者或其中經過某種統一編列手續，亦未可知。廣告之面積，闊大異常，全以塗滿整　牆面為止。不留邊隙，凡車上所能見之牆坦，悉遭塗抹，數十里間，纍纍接目者，儼然均係帶屋頂之廣告牌，亦可謂為奇觀。</p>
<p>此次列車共有頭，二，三等車的十餘輛，記者曾往來各車廂巡視，頭等二等車，乘客稀少，車出站十分鐘時，在頭等餐車上，記者卽曾目擊一肥胖之白制服茶房，伏桌面打盹，口涎下垂幾及三寸，其淸閑無事可見。三等車上乘客擁擠，但大半目的地均為天津。唐山一帶。祗有數人擬至山海關，然後出關赴僞「滿。記者就其中一人談話時，該人竟守口如瓶，兩手緊挾皮包，若畏人詢問者。有某國浪人三五，著賤價布之西裝，不打領帶，在各車箱中來往閒走；未繫帶之皮鞋，則在車中之鐵皮地面上，懶伴佯拖來拖去，「梯他」作聲不絕。有時忽然停步向乘客注視，若甚注意者。但一俟此乘客向彼輩注視時，則彼輩又面現搬然之色，逡巡而去。到底有無所謂，令人疑猜不定。蒙古在三等車廂中，有喇嘛—餘人，及綏遠省武川一帶之漢人數十人，獨據車廂一節。喇嘛等一律著絳紫色僧衣，惟油垢甚厚，各人均手持佛珠一串，口中念念有詞，漢人則一律藍布大褂，紅頂瓜皮帽，腦後長髮，拖出三數寸。有偶去其帽者，則腦門至頭頂一段，固剃去甚凈，猶是長辮時代之式樣。依意度之，　長辮或亦係新近剪去，亦未可知。彼輩言語，可聽懂者僅「天津」「武川」「太平」等幾個簡單詞句而已。然由此簡單詞句中，已可得悉彼等係由武川來平，轉赴天津者。而武川（記者按此地為綏東至綏西之要道，王英匪衆，曾常由此來往竄擾。）目前情况，可由「太平」一語中知其大概。至於彼輩赴天津之目的何在，因言語不通，多方詢問，未能得其要領。</p>
<p>一時三十分，車抵豐台站。車中浪人，亦在此蜂擁下車，記者隨之而下。豐台地屬小鎭，除車站左近外，鎭上甚少見衣冠整齊之人，祇有某國浪人，常著蹩脚西裝，在破爛之街頭徜徉，是以，凡屬身著西裝，而又不多開口者，均有被人疑為「友邦」人士之危險。記者步行過街頭時，覺處處均被路人側目，初尚不知何故，繼乃一加注意，方知彼等目光中，實含有畏懼及厭惡之兩種意思。蓋已被疑為「友邦」人士，不覺中心梗塞如吞油膩物事。有種說不出之難受。但浪人之屬，似均以同類之眼光目我，與對於本地居民之出以輕蔑揶揄眼光者，迥不相同，殊為可笑。但尋思處此「是非窠」中，一切毫無保障，隨時有受揶揄之危險，不如利用此等猜疑不定，轉可略覺安全也。因乃更加緘口不首，全憑兩眼對一切作一大略觀察，實際上，縱使多方詢問，恐亦無人敢以情况見告。</p>
<p>街長約里餘，衰敗之象，處處可見。社會秩序，表面尚屬平穩，但十種處於某種重壓下之窄逼空氣，固亦到處可覺。街為南北街，街市僅有一邊，住戶並非隔街對宇，而係一律朝東，面對車站，街之前面，有二三尺闊之小溝一道，蜿蜒由南而北，與街　長度相等。髒水汨汨而流，日光蒸晒，臭氣瀰漫。「友邦軍隊，携武器往來者，不斷可見。鎭外，隱隱有砲聲機關槍聲，斷續傳來。蓋是日適為大演習之第一日，至於吾國軍隊之灰制服，此行　在水定門車站上曾一見　，若夫豐台街上，則更加不見踪影。</p>
<p>步行街市時，　有鑼鼓喧閱之聲，自街南傳來與隆隆砲聲，達達機關槍聲，遙相應和。循　走近，忽見有一丈餘見力之白布旗招，橫飄空際，遠遠卽辨明其上有斗大之「日中聯合五豐大戲院」等字。及至門前，間其門上，交叉挿有我國國旗及某國太陽形之國旗二大幅，殊覺不倫不類。所謂大戲院者，係以蓆搭成高大之篷一座而巳。門首有浪人三五，排立成行，高　向行人兜攬。記者至門首時，曾略一躇躊，但已引起彼等之特殊注意，日光炯炯相注視不稍休，遂乃不如當機立斷。高視闊步入塲。此時，彼等乃頓改前態，並未向記者要票，祇於讓行後，在身後揚言，「買票看戲」「買票看戲」而巳。如竟置之不理，想亦必不致更來索要也。然記者終取出角票一毛，購票而進。購票時，並附贈所謂「贈福券一者一紙。據其解釋，由一號至四十號中，任顧客擇定，號。終塲時，舉行抓彩，均有得獎之希望。塲內最後方，設有條桌，牆上有紅紙一張，書明為「軍警彈壓席，」其前，踞有上着西服秋大衣，下着灰布中國式棉褲者一人，手持文明杖，諒此人卽係所謂「軍警」矣。此人坐臥不寗，時時向顧客椰揄作態。記者曾目擊其以文明杖之灣柄，將座中一鄉村老婦之緾足，高高勾起，該老婦搖搖欲跌，大　驚呼，急將其足抽回。此人又迅以其杖，勾該老婦之另一足，以致驚呼之聲不斷。該人乃撫掌大笑。塲中座位，分為男女兩攔，中以木柵相隔，兩欄中，細長之木條凳，各百餘張。座位的五六百個，居然空者不多，上座三四百，不禁為之慨嘆。顧客全係來自下層社會者，眞不知此一角錢之票價，從何而來，來此之目　，究係為的娛樂，抑係專為抓彩。而眉目間一付嘻嘻憨笑，茫然無知之顢頇狀態，睹之尤覺心痛。戲台上，坐有操樂器者五六人之多，唱者為十歲左右之小孩二人，而此二小孩，民然會向台下作眉眼，令人悽愴之至。唱　　尖，如鷄呌而　，不辨所唱何物。記者正在舉目向塲內　　光景打量時，忽聞呼一好一之怪聲，哄然而起，乃急看台上，蓋正有一十五六歲之女角，　出台門處，扭扭揑揑向台中走來也。隔座有類似鐵路小工者二人，此時乃互作耳語。一日：「嚇，瞧這浪。」另曰：「可惜麻啦」。於是，其一則大聲詰問：「誰說的」。另一亦大聲喝道：「我自個兒瞅見的」，兩人喧爭不休，終至被此打賭，相率到台近處　觀究竟。至此，記者已覺作惡欲嘔，不能再耐，離座出塲，彼等執勝孰負，亦不及看到。</p>
<p>順骯髒之臭水溝，沿街向北行，擬尋一飯館用食，藉便看情形，久久不可得。及至街之北頭，始見　敗壞之飯舖在焉。而其旁近，則有粉牆一道，上有「朝鮮料理」等字。粉牆內究作何狀，本擬進內一觀，後以見浪人成羣從內而出，因恐引出麻煩，故乃中止。踏進敗壞之飯舖後，蒼蠅逐人轟然而飛，其內並無顧客。但一轉身間，忽見一上身着西服襯衫，並繫領結，下着土黃馬褲，黑皮長靴之人，正在灶前以尺餘長之廚刀，削鉛筆也。記者擇座與其相隣，以企一看究竟，此人所坐桌上，置隆然之黑皮包一隻，面前有拍紙簿一本，並未飲食，祗蜷伏一隅，一面抽紙烟，一面沉思。有時，則在紙上霄寫，不知究作何語，與侍役說話時，含糊難懂，多半靠手勢為助。此人大概係「友邦」人士，其索然伏此，不知其使命若何。</p>
<p>出飯舖後，繼續北行，將近某國兵營時，見路邊圍立閒人十餘，有二人正在相扭吵嚷。一造為洋車夫，另一造則某國之浪人。浪人身着灰西裝，時時拳擊對方之胸際，嘴中喃喃作語，不知所云何物；但由態度神情測之，想係惡毒之駡人語。洋車夫則屹立受擊，不敢還手，但一俟該浪人回身欲去時，彼四急扭其西服後襟不放，雖因此受更凶之拳毆，亦在所不計。其所爭之事，據車夫云，係彼於停車時，由袋中落下銅元一大枚，被該浪人搶先檢去，不肯交還。此車夫年老樸拙，諒所言非虛。該浪人經數次欲走未遂後，忽大肆咆哮，指近在咫尺之兵營，擬拖該車夫入內。正扭纏間，此時忽有演習歸來少「友邦」軍人一隊，抬機　槍數架回營。車夫見此，乃迅速揩揩眼淚，拖起洋車，急馳他去。旁觀者亦急作鳥獸散。浪人得意揚揚欵　而去。</p>
<p>時左右，記者回到車站，爬上平津慢車後，始覺如釋重負，透口長氣。但一覩及高豎天空「友邦」兵營之太陽形國旗，又不禁悲從中來，胸襟如縛矣。（九，二十八。）</p>

<h3 id="c46">日本統制北紙業之意義 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>近者日本紙業資本家秉軍部之意志。紛紛在天津籌設大規模之造紙廠。以圖壟斷中國之紙業。東洋製紙會社。籌資一千萬擬於天津特一區海河畔設造紙廠。並繼續在華北五省。創設分廠。負籌辦之責者。多為軍部之要人。大坂合同製紙會社。亦於天津特一區大直沽購地三千畝。以資本五百萬。籌辦紙廠。日本開發華北經濟之計畫。經緯萬端。而彼國政府。獨認紙業之統制。為其國策推行之主要部分。須提前舉辦。蓋有深長之用意。設此項計畫完成。固不僅吾國之紙業報業出版業及一切文化事業。受極大之影響已也。</p>
<p>吾國產紙之不能自給。為國民經濟之最大弱點。國內雖有小規模之紙廠三十餘家。然資本合計。不足千萬每年產量。僅四十萬磅餘。且品質低劣。不足供新式印刷之用。故外紙進口。達五六千萬元之鉅。設加拿大·瑞典·挪威·日本·美國等處之紙張進口斷絕。則國內報紙刋物。書籍文吿。必趨於停頓之狀態。近年以來。政府及入民。深察此項危機。急圖補救。一方面以關稅為手段。以保護及提倡國內之已有紙業。使外紙因關稅而價格抬高。國貨紙張。得競爭之可能。一方面積極籌設大規模之造紙廠。以為治本之方。溫溪造紙廠資本四百五十萬。為籌辦中之官商合營公司。商股六十萬。由商務中華申報新聞報等出版商家分担。官股三百九十萬。則向中英庚欵撥借。該廠之籌備。行將就緒。購機建廠。期明年可以完成。雖其製造數量。恐僅足敷滬上數家報紙之用。然有此基礎。發展較為容易矣。</p>
<p>今日本利用其大量資本。與熟練及進步之技術與人才。以華北一帶之蘆葦為原料。藉賤價之勞工。及其在華北優越之地位。創立紙廠。以統制華北紙業。進而統制全中國之紙業。則吾國現有之幼稚紙廠及行將完成之溫溪紙廠。必遭受極大之打擊。蓋目前日本紙張。雖年有八百萬元左右之輸入。然大體受吾國海關之限制。每百公斤課二元六金單位之稅。成本旣昂。國產紙遂得有競爭之可能。今華北設廠。出品不受關稅之限制。國內紙廠。將喪失競爭之力。而溫溪紙廠之前途。亦甚暗淡。中國紙業。勢將受日本之統制。一旦不幸而有國際戰爭發生。海口被鎖。瑞典加拿大美國等處紙張。來源斷絕。報紙無從出版。印刷事業。完全停止。則舉國將入於羣盲狀態。而彼國可以利用其報紙傳單。以動搖我之民心。沮喪我之士氣。宣傳侵略。為所欲為矣。</p>
<p>故吾人於日本統制華北紙業之企圖。不可視之為等閑。願政府當局。速謀新式紙廠之。創設已有紙廠之。發展急起。直追以免臨渴掘。井一紙之微。實有關於民族存亡。吾人注意國防工作。誠不當僅着眼於飛機炸彈也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）保守黨今日在瑪爾門地方舉行大會、先由海相霍爾爵士發表精彩演說、大會繼通過决議案、贊助政府國防計劃、霍爾演辭、略稱、値此全歐重整武裝時代、英國除毫不延遲實行重整軍備外、並無他途可循、目下地位、遠較六個月前、政府宣佈各大國大增軍備時、更見惡劣、各大國在最近六個月中、已增加軍備甚多、而小國如比·荷·及瑞士亦均從事大規模軍備計畫、茲有兩種敎訓、為吾人所宜注意者、卽（一）單方面裁軍之無益、（二）英帝國有大加鞏固之必要、俾得成為保障和平之勢力、德國每年軍費、不下八萬萬鎊之鉅、德國預算、陸海軍部份、已達百分之四十六之驚人數額、霍爾又述及法·俄·美等國重整軍備情形、謂愛國人民、對於各國軍備數字、自不容忽視、現在由痛苦之經騐、證明英帝國之衰弱、實為國際政治不安定之因素、</p>
<p>霍爾繼言及英國軍備進步情形稱、目下海軍建造程序進行之速、頗出當時所預料、英國空軍擁有多數成績優異之軍官及士兵、不久卽可調用之新式飛機、與任何國家相較、亦决不落後、軍需機構在歐戰數年中、顯已消耗殆盡、今欲加以恢復、恐亦需相當時日、英國現尚未達到需要戰事佈置之地步、經濟繁榮之回復、尚不致有何影響、「由廣義的國家立塲觀察、余仍信最賢明之辦法、卽為設法避免此類鉅大之經濟恐慌」被曲解之和平主義、及黨派門戶之見、對於陸軍之徵募自有相當影響，政府應速採取步驟、將國家之需要、及兵役之利益、更明白昭告國人、</p>

<p>— 李聖五</p>
<p>一　序言</p>
<p>本年八月二十四日成都民衆發生暴動，搗毀旅舍商店等，當時軍警民衆互有傷亡，旅川日人四名亦遭毆擊，其中二人名渡邊洸三郎及深川經二者，傷重斃命；田中武夫及瀨戶尚二人當被救出。此案發生之後，卽經地方當局逮捕暴動份子兩名，就地執行極刑，日本方面派遣軍艦於重慶，然而兩國對於此項事件之正式交涉，截至作者執筆時，尚未開始。不意一波未平，一波又起，突見九月八日各報章登載，廣東北海民衆示威運動中又有殺害當地日僑中野順三事（一說與中國人鬥毆喪命），此案詳情如何，迄今尚無所聞，卽成都事件之調查報告，官方亦未公表。在此等情形之下，如妄予評論，恐不免發生與事實不符之處；如不加批評，徒向日方對於解决此案作種種之期望，則又與實際無所補益。不得已，謹將國際問幾件保僑名案，簡略叙述如下，藉以伸明國際間解决此類案件之不同方式。次則國家對於罹害外僑應負何等責任，亦予以簡單論列。</p>
<p>「保僑」一名詞，範圍甚廣，凡一國人民僑居他國，輕至於受人凌辱、重至於生命財產被人侵害，而未得到住在國政府之適當保護，或於事發之後，未得到住在國政府之適當補救，經認為違背公平正義者，被害僑民之祖國政府，均有以外交手段起而保護之權。國際間保僑案件之紀載，至為繁多，而其發生之情形，亦極複雜。本文祇就暴動事件，擇要叙述，並將國家於變亂時發生之危害外僑事件，亦於原則上論列及之。</p>
<p>二　一八九一年之紐阿連暴動案（MobatNew．Orleans　in　1891）</p>
<p>一八九一年三月十四日僑居美國紐阿連之意大利人十一名，因有暗殺警察署長韓納西（D.C.　Heunesy）之嫌疑，慘被當地暴動民衆所殺戳，意僑被書之時，均以殺人嫌疑被捕入獄，其中五人尚未經過審訊，三人業已釋放，其他三人正待二審。至於警察署長韓納西被害原因，係為圖謀破壞一種秘密組織（名為Mafia），而招怨恨。十一名意大利人被殺之後，駐紐阿連意大利領事立卽報告意大利駐美公使，該公使亦於同日接到本國外交部訓令，要求美國政府採取迅速有效手段以保護僑居紐阿達之意大利人民，並依法懲辦暴動份子。意大利公使遵照此項訓令，卽為備文通知美國政府，同時保留意大利政府之要求賠償權。同日美國國務院電令肇事所在地之總督（Governor　Nicholls），將暴動份子置諾法律裁制，嚴防同樣事件之發生：並說明美意　條約所載，美國負有保護意僑生命財產安全之義務，美總統對於紐阿述暴動事伴之發生，深表遺憾等語。</p>
<p>美國國務院當將致總督之電報，抄送意大利公使一份。但意政府堅持要求賠償之議，此　如不能辦到，卽撤回駐美公使。至一八九一年三月三十一日意大利公使對美提出下列兩項要求：（一）聯邦政府正式承諾懲辦暴動份子。（二）在原則上承認予被害家屬以賠償。同時通知美國政府，卽行離美回國。意大利公使旣經回國，意大利公使館事務遂由代辦負責。一八九一年四月一日美國國務院致意大利代辦之文書中，叙及上述兩項要求，謂美政府已在原則上承認賠償被害意人，因彼等由，美意條約所享受之權利，或被侵害也。但三月十四日發生之不幸事件，須予澈底查究，不能過分迫促，且於正式承允任何要求之前，須將查究所獲事實，依法詳為裁判，此層業經屢向回國之意大利公使伸明；意方之急燥，或情有可原，但過分急燥，不必定換得合乎正義之解决云云。</p>
<p>意大利政府　諛解美國政府之上項文書、認為美國政府正式承認負責賠償。美國國務卿布蘭（Mr.Blaine）氏遂於一八九一年四月十四日照會意代辦校正其錯誤解釋，並謂意大利之條約權是否被侵害，美總統現有許多事實待其决定。布蘭氏根據法律將各項事實分析論列以後，於文書之結束處有以下語句：</p>
<p>紐阿連暴動中被害之意國人民，係暫住或久居於該地者。假若彼等之生活行動，均能無悖於美意條約之條欵，未違背吾國之移民律，無礙於美國之治安，並且遵守美國及該意僑等住在地之法律，在官廳方面，假若未盡保護外僑生命財產之責，或縱容暴動事件之發生，或明知已有暴動之危機而不採取適當鎭懾手段，或於暴動事件旣經發生以後不將肇事暴徒置諸法網。在此等情形之下，美國總統當然承認案已成立，必將提交國會、予以考慮，而對慘遭殺害者之親屬，予以救濟。</p>
<p>一八九一年五月五日紐阿連之大法官將暴動經過作成報告，赦免參加暴動進攻監獄諸份子，旣未起訴，亦未審訊。</p>
<p>暴動案發生後之次年十二月六日　美總統哈禮孫（President　Harison）於其致國會之文書中有以下之聲明：</p>
<p>美國政府為對意大利政府表示友誼，對紐阿連事件之發生，深自譴責，並以十二萬五千法郎作為賠償；意大利國王於接受之餘，亟表感激；此案之解决，實足增進美。意兩國之友好及互相敬重之情緒云云。</p>
<p>當一八九二年四月十二日美國國務卿布蘭氏將賠欵十二萬五千佛郎送交與意大利代辦之時，復於照會中加重伸述，意國人民所受之損害，非美國所直接加與者，換言之，美國政府對於此項事件，並無法律上之責任；然而美總統認為付以滿意之賠欵，乃美國政府之神聖義務，亦美國政府之無上愉快。布蘭氏進一步表明美總統希望此案之解决，足以掃除因此案所引起之惡劣印像，美意兩國舊有之友誼邦交得以恢復，嗣後不再發生足以危害兩國和睦懇摯之不幸事件。意代辦當卽接受賠欵，並代表意政府答覆布蘭氏之詞令，同時依照意政府訓令聲明兩國邦交從此立刻恢復。</p>
<p>觀紐阿連　暴動案之解决經過，有兩點足資注意；（一）意大利要求懲兇，美政府未予接受。（二）美政府賠欵十二萬五千佛郎，乃出於友誼表示，非履行法律責任。一八八五年在美國羅開斯普林（Rock　Springs）發生屠殺華僑事件，其解决情形如何，亦有叙述之價値。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c81">虹口閘北情勢昨轉緊　日軍崗位展至蘇州河　越界崗巡晚撤去　北四川路各要道架設鐵絲網　情勢突然轉緊原因傳說有二 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>新聲社云、自二十三日晚虹口日水兵被狙擊案發生、日陸戰隊藉口護僑、布防虹口、並越入閘北、過去數日情形、本已和緩、乃昨晨日軍又顯活動、局勢忽大有轉緊之象、迄晚、虹口方面依然、閘北一帶則復和緩、新聲社記者調查所得實况如次、</p>
<p>日軍布防　達蘇州河</p>
<p>查過去數日、日軍在租界布防、原僅限於老靶子路以北、昨日淸晨五時起、日軍擴大範圍、竟達蘇州路蘇州河畔、沿北四川路乍浦路一帶、遍置哨兵、甚且於北四川路·與老靶子路·海寗路·蓬路·武昌路·天潼路·隣近郵政管理局·各要道之路旁、架設鐵絲網、隨時可以阻止交通、更於老靶子路口、架輕機關槍一架</p>
<p>馬路梭巡　較前頻繁</p>
<p>日軍在租界以北四川路邢家橋挽永豐大樓、及狄思威路·其美路口、五零四號洋房兩分防所　為中心、分別派出鐵甲車·軍用卡車·機器脚踏車·及散兵或整隊、至各馬路梭巡、本僅限於老靶子路以北者、昨亦南向、而迄蘇州河、且往來較前頻繁、同時狄思威路之日軍崗位及梭巡、昨亦由天漳路　口而擴展至嘉興路橋、與吳淞路日軍　接、蓬路日本人俱樂部、又重派日軍數十名駐守、他若海寗路等各馬路、所有虹口區域、幾無處無日軍崗巡、以上係租界方面昨日午前情形、迄晚九時許、記者再分往巡視時、除日本人俱樂部駐軍已不見、僅有崗位一名外、他如梭巡啄，鐵絲網等等種種情形依然、未有變化</p>
<p>閘北一帶　又設崗位</p>
<p>閘北方面、日軍則以花園街底灘屋酒廠及歐陽路四達路口日本女子學校分防所為中心、市區各馬路、自虹口日水兵案發生之當晚、日軍曾派崗位、翌晚卽行撤退後、過去六日、未曾派崗、乃昨晨七時起、南至束寳山路同濟路口、西至橫濱河近日本墓地、北至廣中路火車過道處、東至歐陽路施高塔路口、沿同濟路恒業路江灣路祥德路歐陽路四達路寶興路一帶、突又有日軍崗位、其美路上、日軍崗位、派至第一號僑、且各路均布置甚密、幾一二百武卽雙崗、均執長槍、同時以上各馬路、日軍梭巡隊、亦較前頻繁、惟同濟路江灣路一帶、則尚無鐵甲車、或鐵絲網之架設耳、</p>
<p>市區情形　入晚安謐</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨晚繼續調查結果、日軍在閘北之重置崗位、不過臨時性質、僅於晨七時至八時半、午十一時半至下午一時、傍晚四時至七時、目的係為保護日僑學生、附近江灣路一帶、多日僑住所、蓋以此三時間內、為日僑小學生入學上課散學回家之時也、故入晚情形、已復安謐、但歐陽路四達路其美路等昆連租界越界築路各處、則全日派崗、迄晚未撤、至灘室造酒廠、昨仍續有卡車載日軍前往、但亦有自該處運出者、附近曠地、則不見日軍、殆為隱於屋內之故、日本墓地、仍僅五名留守、</p>
<p>緊張原因　傳說有二</p>
<p>關於日軍擴大布防之原因、傳說有二、一說係因中山秀雄案昨日開審宣判、日軍故作示威、一說北四川路各要通口之鐵絲網、於前日深夜、卽已架設、因昨日淸晨一時、有日艦一艘、秘密到滬、載來大批日軍及軍械、日軍為避人耳目、故有鐵絲網之架設、當日軍登岸運械時、曾一度斷絕交通云、</p>
<p>日使領館　不作表示</p>
<p>日外交人員、對日軍之舉、不作表示、記者昨曾赴日使館探詢、其情報部代表、仍以一向之慣言、答復記者、謂陸戰隊行動、除其自動發表外、吾人殊不得而知云，又新任日使館三等書記官曾稱、日前晉京、謁日大使川越、報告到滬、並傳達其外務省訓示、巳於昨晨、偕另一前此晉京之日使館書記官、返滬視事</p>

<p>會長演說</p>
<p>次由副會長許曉初演說云、本會以為値此商戰時代、要使本國貨物發展、必須使生產者與消費者多有接觸機會、國貨展覽會、卽為最好辦法、因為如此可以使廠商知所改進、民衆採購、可無受外貨冒牌之愚、年來因國人心理之改變、及提倡之努力、故入超日趨减少、此實强國固本之良好現象、本人希望諸位此後仍一本愛國初衷、宣傳提倡、俾國貨事業、發揚光大云云、次胡西園·潘仰堯·王性堯·等相繼演說、同時該會為普遍宣傳起見、故每日請周邦俊在中西電台許曉初在大陸電台播音云、</p>

<p>自白相符者、互相印證、則其自白、殊可置信、總之本案已至絕無疑義之地步、應請對被告等　為有罪之判决、處以極刑云云、次由唐懷羣郭啟明·兩律師為楊文道·周社榮·辯護、大旨着重於在楊家搜出藏槍書籍一點、以法醫研究所卽經騐明書　中並無楊建中之手指紋、則楊文道指係建中栽害為不足信、然該所並經騐明、亦無楊文道之指紋遺留書內、當更可認定此書非在楊家搜出之原書、楊旣</p>

<p>惟林根弟則言之鑿鑿</p>

<p>行兇之日確為八月八號、但我當時幷未撳住彩英之嘴、彩英亦未呼救、只見其雙足略為跳動、常蔣用斧砍傷彩英之頭後、我卽逃去云云、繼據茅阿根洪、八月八號、我自下午三時起、卽開救火會二頭目之車至公和祥碼頭送客上船、至四時左右、又開車送頭目至虹口救火會拍球、至下午八時、又至楊樹浦威妥碼路自來水廠、應友人之突、當時頭目卽命將車停于揚樹浦捕房、至午夜十二時、方再開車、往接頭目回家、故對于</p>

<p>近兩月來、兩廣藉口抗日稱兵異動、然而為全國輿論和廣東將領所反對、廣東約問題、已經很迅速地得到和乎解决、這是證明中國軍人現在都有了團結統一的覺悟、不是少數野心家所能刦持的了、在這裏使我們回憶起歷史上許多團結禦侮的敎訓來、在十八世紀約下半期、德國各王公都不能合作、因為一的分王公想取得萊茵河右岸部利益、在一七九五年巴賽爾和平談判的時候、就把萊茵左岸、割給法國、從此以後、德國的國勢愈趨愈下、一八〇六年拿破侖且不顧一切、組織了一個萊茵聯邦、在聯邦裏不以萊茵兩岸屬於它的範圍、就連培恩巴登瓦登堡同海數、都包括在內、差不多佔了德國土地三分之一以上、在拿破侖威力壓迫之下、普魯士根本沒有抵抗的力量、當時日耳曼民族的危機、是和今日的中國並沒有兩樣的、但是後來經過了阿恩特斐區德傑恩等多人的奔走呼號、德國人的民族意識、才逐漸喚醒、才知道團結統一的必要、因此才有自由戰爭和一八六六年對奧戰爭的勝利、後來又經過俾斯麥的勵精團結、如統一北德和關稅同盟的成功、所以才有一八七一年對法抗戰的勝利、我們在這　所得到的敎訓、是什麽呢、就是德國如果沒有阿恩特斐區德傑恩的大聲疾呼、德國人民也許不會有這樣快的覺悟和團結、沒有當時的團結、留不會有自由戰爭和對奧作戰的勝利、沒有俾斯麥統一北德和關稅同盟的成功、就不會有一八七一年普法之戰的勝利、親愛的同學們、歷史的事實、吿訴我們、一個國家處在危亡的關頭、如果不甘滅亡、除了團結統一而外、的確找不出第二條救國的道路、國家如此、小而言之、就是學生團體也必須團結統一、舉策羣力、才有光榮的前途、留學生是受過高等敎育的智識分子、現在身處異域所受刺激、較一般國民更為深切、所以對於這種團結統一的努力、尤其是應該首先實行首先偶導的、本會成立、已經三年、在這三年當中、尤其是最近一年、可以說沒有什麽顯著的成績、在這莊嚴隆重的開幕典禮中、希望大家依照我們成立宜霄上所說、切磋學問、聯絡感情為宗旨、在團結統一的救國道路上、向着勝利的目標前進、</p>

<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>農民曹金從廣州淸潔公司賬房裏用現錢換得起貨單之後退了出來。珠江從遠遠的海裏回來了，閃着逼眼的金光，奉着最急迫的調子，把河底浮動的黃泥翻了起來，挾着各種貝殼動物，變色的海藻，和被人類拋棄的廢物倒流進闊大的田地裏。牠正像一條純金色的巨大無比的毒蛇。渾身飽脹着，每一個蛇皮上的小孔冒出氣泡。十五里附近的江面上都充滿帶腥味的晨早的海風，剛勁，使廣州的人們比昨天更加勇敢。</p>
<p>沙面像一隻泥　似地在江邊浮起來，牠底背上長滿遠年的綠苔。兩岸的灰色的瓦屋遙遙相對，聳立在牠們之上的是海關底以巨石築成的樓房。海關底時鐘以沉重的悠然的金屬聲嗚呌着，江中的汽船的響笛猶如小孩子底呌喊。兩邊堤岸前的磚瓦和淤泥最先被打濕了，不久就完全浸沒在水裏。</p>
<p>在這邊，在對岸，在河中，被種種的聲音伴和着，廣州每天的勞動的歌聲開始了。牠好像是這樣的：</p>
<p>「昨天已經過去了，跟着我們來……</p>
<p>今天，我們在全世界，築起一個快樂，沒有欺騙的所在，</p>
<p>跟着我們來！」</p>
<p>曹金底弟弟曹海坐在一隻糞船上，一看見他哥哥就在船尾搖搖晃晃地站了起來。小艇繫在前頭的碼頭下，被江水冲激着，堅决地用牠底尖腦袋朝岸邊上冒。</p>
<p>他們用了過高的聲音交談着：</p>
<p>「買了幾担了？」在船上的人問。</p>
<p>「一共二十五担。」這善良的哥哥回答，並且比着手勢</p>
<p>「多呀！」</p>
<p>「不多！」</p>
<p>「撑得起嗎？」</p>
<p>「你又想偷瀨喇！」</p>
<p>船上的人看見哥哥底滿意的高興的面孔，就不說什麽，重復在船尾上坐下了。</p>
<p>曹金坐在岸邊一塊大石頭上，他底週圍是一面寬闊的泥地。他用一片碎瓦在他底脚下畫出一壟一壟的田畝，在每一格裏寫着「五穀豐登」或「人畜平安」那樣的字眼。從淸潔公司底糞埠通到碼頭去的那條灰白的紅毛泥路把强烈的陽光反射在他底額頭上面。</p>
<p>淸潔公司管賬員孫永昌用壁虎一樣的脚步朝那農民身邊走去。他是一個貪心的閒人，年紀四十上下，非常皺縮的臉孔使人疑心他不斷地在服用一種苦藥。</p>
<p>他一邊走一邊想：「佃戶都是些愚蠢的動物——可是為什麽從他們身上也可以弄出錢來呢！哼，蠢貨！拿出錢來的時候總要裝成捨不得的『孤寒』樣子，然而始終是不加不减地掏出現錢來！」</p>
<p>他十分輕蔑地問曹金：</p>
<p>「你底想頭已經改正過來了麽？」</p>
<p>「我底什麽想頭？」</p>
<p>「Ai——！」他底聲音由低而高，帶着不自然的抖動。「你不常常說的麽？你說：政府是什麽事情都不管的！」</p>
<p>「是的。難道不是麽？」</p>
<p>曹金說了，警惕地望了一望孫永昌。那張臉除了皺紋以外一無所有，但彷彿露佈着一種氣熖——這是廣州的稅商捐棍所常有的，他們自以為他們在替政府管理着納稅的人民。孫永昌把苦澀的眼睛在滾滾流動的珠江上溜了一溜，那裏面運載各種貨物的小船媽蟻似地爬行着。假如他要敎訓那蠢笨的農民曹金，他想這正是時候了。</p>
<p>「你怎麽能够這樣說呢，我底牛屎哥？」</p>
<p>「就說糞料的價錢吧，請你不要怪我，」曹金卑怯地回答，他不預備使賬房師爺孫永昌發怒。「你們加了價，到底還是你們自己的意思。」</p>
<p>「可是你胡說八道。加糞價為什麽是我們自己的意思？什麽政府不准的事情誰也不能做。」</p>
<p>孫永昌瞪大眼睛望着碼頭邊，許多小船被河水推湧着互相軋得吱吱地響，閒着沒事的舵夫屈起脚，在陽光裏面抱着腦袋打盹。曹金伸出手指計算着：</p>
<p>「一個三分六（廣東幣制小洋五分）……又一個三分六……昌叔我並非對你訴苦，一担屎値得多少錢——怎禁得這樣加起價來呢。好像是政府很聽從你們底話。管你們——道神事情自然是不會有的。」</p>
<p>「好東西！好東西！不久你就會造反的！我敢輸賭。」</p>
<p>管賬師爺孫永昌離開了曹金，任由那誠實的佃戶獨自坐在一條紅毛泥走道攔腰隔開的瓦泥的廣塲上，自己走到岸邊去了。珠江不愉快地咆哮起來，什麽地方發出潮水咬岸的巨聲。牠搖顫着自己的金光閃熠的身軀，向孫永昌發出警告，一頭猛獸似地呌他不要靠近牠。</p>
<p>為什麽孫永昌會不讓他自已滿意別人呢？——當那管賬師爺走到碼頭邊把那些船夫一個一個地駡遍了的時候，曹金想着這樣的問題。人們可以假設孫永昌是一個不會做生意的笨拙的商人。許多顧客從四鄉懷着現金到省城來購買別人以為只是廢物的糞料，——這是怎樣的買賣呢？但是孫永昌却不喜歡任何他底顧客。彷彿這也是一樁好笑的事，曹金甜甜地笑了。</p>
<p>孫永昌把他對於各個船夫的僧惡（其實恰像他不滿意於全人類）說了出來之後，回頭跑到曹金面前對他說：</p>
<p>「你是一個傻鳥頭！你中了你弟弟底毒——他會是好死的嗎！世界上什麽東西都有人管理，而政府管理着一切人。這個碼頭，這些船，這些混蛋，不都是要人好好地管着的麽？如果他們大家都攪亂了，試問這個世界還成什麽樣子！」</p>
<p>碼頭上有一個曹金必須找尋的人物，他是碼頭流氓大蛇頭在德山。這個人根據一種習慣管理着五個碼頭，牠們一個接連一個地排列在珠江邊上，站着，呆呆地望着永不乾涸的江心，好像牠們自己是在一天一天地緩緩地沉落下去，牠們底木脚被嚙被摩擦，生起溜滑的綠苔，但有幾隻脚却異常瘦削，好像那上面的皮肉早已被牠去了，剩下精細的差不多要折斷的骨筒。</p>
<p>汪德山用他底强大的勢力和廣州市政府平分這五個碼頭底統治權，上面的脚伕只有在他底命令之下下能得到工作，而任何貨物底起運沒有得到他底同意不能動手。</p>
<p>「拿錢來……」他向貨主說，得了錢之後他就大聲向部下呌嚷：「來兩個人！你們都死掉了嗎！」這粗魯大意的大蛇頭經常只說着道樣的話，吩咐之後他就跑開。不管事，而且不知道他應該感謝誰——這個「人賦給他權力，地盤和臣民。</p>
<p>曹金在淸潔公司碼頭上到處找尋着，障礙視綫的貨物和建築物這里一點都沒有，江邊上平坦坦的一片黑土，沒有在德山也沒有一個脚伕。他轉進淸潔公司賬房間去</p>
<p>「為什麽還不出貨呢？」管賬師爺孫永昌問。</p>
<p>曹金用手指着玻璃窗回答</p>
<p>「你看外面靜靜地……貨物自己有脚麽？」</p>
<p>孫永昌向他提議假如他能够給他六毛錢，那麽他用賬房底名義允許他自己出貨。汪德山有什麽囉囌可以跟賬房交涉。</p>
<p>「這是非法的事情！」曹金這　說。但是他却很高興地接受了孫永昌底提議。這樣，那不幸的一天就伴隨着碼頭話呌做「偷私」的這件事開始了。</p>
<p>他們兩兄弟動手起出那二十五担糞料的時候，大蛇頭在德山帶了八個兄弟從米埠那邊走來了。「那是曹金！他跳躍着跑上去，所有的人跟着他跑。他他們動手打那兩兄弟——那兩個無論在什麽地方都容易上當的農民。弟弟曹海首先被打昏了，不省人事地被扔在自己的小船上。哥哥曹金被竹扁担擊斷了一根肋骨，爬到賬房間底玻璃窗下面，躺在那里哼氣管賬師爺孫永昌帶着從戲院走出來那種可以回味的滿足的心情緩緩地走到窗邊，窗上一個鬼影似的人頭立刻露了出來。他在裏面舉手敲打窗上的玻璃，敲了幾下又敲幾下，想呌躺在室外瓦簷下的受了重傷的曹金睜開眼睛。他看見曹金張大嘴巴，臉上因為疼痛而失了血色，渾身抖顫着，但是聽不見他呌嚷着一些什麽。</p>
<p>曹金把眼睛睜開了，但看不見任何東西，於是把腦袋麻木地左右移動着。</p>
<p>「你底運氣眞壞呀，可憐的笨七！你為什麽……單單要等大蛇頭回來才出貨呢。……不遲不早，趕來正好——你眞是沒有彩數喇！……喂，你現在怎樣了？站不起來走了吧？那麽你打算怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>老是一陣陣地在敲裏面打玻璃窗，管賬師爺孫永昌對外面那逐漸在失去知覺的「偷私」人反覆說着上面那樣的話。</p>

<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>「一年好景君須記，又是橙黃橘綠時。」</p>
<p>如今國產的橘子柑子，快快要成熟了。據宋人韓彥直的橘譜裏說，柑有眞柑，生枝柑，海紅柑，洞庭相，甜柑，木柑，朱柑，饅頭柑。橘有黃橘，朱橘，綠橘，乳橘，塌橘，沙橘，包橘，綿橘，早黃橘，荔枝橘。如今一般人只知道柑有可吃的汕頭椪柑雪柑，厦門蕉柑，及不可吃的臭皮柑；橘因產地得名，有廣橘洞庭橘黃巖蜜橘之類。橘譜說是「柑橘出蘇州，台州，西出荊州，南出閡廣撫州，告不如溫州者為上。就我個人所見，溫州橘子含有苦味，雖說苦中有甜，未必可算上品。又依李時珍本草裏說：「柑，南方果也，而閩廣溫台蘇撫荊州為盛，川蜀雖有，不及之。」不錯，柑橘是南方果物，北方氣候寒冷，於柑橘不相宜，就是栽種了，也會變種。大的我國土壤氣候上南北之分，以淮水為界。淮水以北就不宜種橘，所以古人有一橘逾淮北則為枳」之說。愈到南方，橘愈甘美，所以廣橘可算是我國的橘王，當然，廣東方面氣候的溫暖，於這個是有很大關係的了。</p>
<p>中國的枇橘，大都是在秋冬之交纔得成熟，摘下。一到春天，橘子就要發爛，舊法收藏，也只能保存外面好看，裏面不是乾癟，就是霉爛，正所謂「金玉其外，敗絮其中。」春夏之間，是不容易找到好橘子吃的。自從海洋大通，美國橘子輸入，於是一年四季，只要你是住在通都大市，而且有綫，就不愁沒有橘子吃了。不過這種橘子在歐美，已經有人她牠太貴，吃牠不起，改吃番茄，所以番茄呌做「窮人橘」。又有諺語說：「家有番茄，沒有病人。」原來番茄是含維他命最豐富的果物，尤其是維他命A的含量較橘類的多八倍。所以番茄在歐美各國，看做日常不可少的滋養食品，和橘類相等，而且產量多，價値低，比較吃橘子，更為合算。番茄輸入我國，和美國橘子相當，不過四五十年光景。栽種牠的人並不多，歡喜吃牠的人也很少，因為稀少的關係，有時價比橘子更貴，只有夏秋之間，產量較多，纔較便宜。別的地方，我不知道，在上海，番茄和美國橘子的市價大致如此。我因為患過二十年的胃病，內子患腸病也有了好幾年。她的腸子開刀，足足有了三年，至今還不能吃硬飯。如今我和她，每日都要吃橘子同時她還須喝番茄湯。這兩樣東西成了我們倆的日常必需品，同時也可以說是奢侈品。三年以來，我們為了這兩種東西，感覺是一種很大的消耗了。</p>
<p>內子的腸病，據醫生說，「這是一種徂嚴重的結核病，非把這一段腸子截去不可。」內子不敢冒險，我也未便勉强。醫生最初說她只能活半年，半年過了，又說她只能活一年。如今活過了三年，醫生說，「她的抵抗力特別强，調養得好。」唉！病人生在我們、這樣的家裏，還能說得調養好麽？拖了一大羣野馬似的孩子，住在大都市的湫隘的弄堂的房子裏，日光不够透射，空氣也不够新鮮，雞汁不能天天有吃，滋養的食料只靠橘子番茄，還常常慮及缺乏。不過她能够常常吃到這兩種東西，似乎收了很大的効果，所以她今還在活着，總算是僥天之倖了。頃讀中華醫學雜誌第一二六期，見侯祥川的「丙種維生素與疾病之關係」一文說：</p>
<p>克氏（Clausen，S．W．）於豚鼠缺乏丙種維生素（卽維他命C）與結核病有密切關係，巳詳為編述。多數研究家所得結果，雖不甚相同，但大多數均以投丙種維生素於結核病患者，能减輕其病症。麻氏及施氏（McConkey　M，and　Smith，D．t．）報告其研究結果，係用長成之豚鼠七十二頭，每日飼以結核病思者之痰，由六星期至四個月，其中有豚鼠二十七頭，因稍缺乏丙種維牛素而致二十六頭思腸結核病。其餘豚鼠飼以同樣食物，外加足量丙種維生素，則息腸結核病者僅二頭。依此斷定丙種維生素有護持豚鼠不患結核病之作用。沙氏（Schagan，B．）曾述及缺乏丙種維生素時，則患壞血病者必多，而患結核病者亦同時增多。</p>
<p>侯先生還有「中國柑屬及其製成物之丙種維生素」一文，說是川化學法及生物學法以測定四十種柑屬果汁，證明沙田柚年柚之丙種維生素含量為最高，其次為雪柑，又次為各種柚，及各種橙，最低為台州蜜橘，本地橘，及黃巖與犬台山之蜜橘。他還以為汕頭蜜橘（又名椪柑）與美國橘比較，共抵抗壞血病之力相同。而廣橘或汕頭雪柑，比較美國橘尤佳。橘類既是含丙種維生素最多的果物，父一個人缺乏丙種維生素與否，與壞血病結核病有密切關係，已經用科學方法研究證明。那末，我的正患着腸結核的妻子，又到了這個橙黃橘綠的時節，不是應該欣喜的麽？</p>

<p>— 思慕</p>
<p>當霓虹燈的彩色的熾熱的光熖開始燒着，閃動着，流轉着，隱現着，追逐着，跳躍着的時候，兩旁行人路的各色各樣的「夜店」凑成的大都會的「雜要劇」也開塲了。</p>
<p>趦趄地蠕蠕地走着—不，前推後擁左逼右擠地蛆動着的行人，觀衆，向着一攤又一攤張望着。</p>
<p>木屐的聲響，在泙湃的呌賣的激流中，在Radio的流行曲的洄漩中葬沒了。女人的Kimono和脂粉的强烈的色調，跟燈光一樣的繚亂戟射着。大學生的舊到發亮的黑制服，中國女學生的異國風的淺色旗袍也在色和光的舞踊中穿揷。</p>
<p>布攤，衣物攤，舊貨攤，書攤，玩具攤，賣「燒烏」的帳篷，沒有攤子的賣花女孩——都市生活不可缺的大小需要，「夜市」都可給你一個滿足，並且還替你造出新的需要。</p>
<p>「記憶助進器！記憶助進器！……」一個眼睛發光的小鬍子吐沫四濺地宣傳着，他的攤子上還掛着一塊寫着「某某博士某某敎授推薦」的</p>
<p>隔幾步的一個女攤販，手裏正忙着把舊襪子剪破，洗擦，嘴裏喃喃地念着，原來她賣的，實騐的是喚做「不用綫」的補破襪子的漿糊。</p>
<p>「啦」的一聲，賣「庭下馱」（在院子裏穿的矮屐）的小販，以表演的姿勢，拚命把他的貨品往地上摔打，剛走過的一個穿洋服的小女人，嚇了一跳，低聲駡出一馬鹿野郎」來。</p>
<p>在好些人園着的當中，一個賣鋸子的漢子使勁的在鋸着木板，鋸斷的木板和木屑已有不少了，帶笑的觀衆似乎倒最注意他的骯髒的額頭上和裸露的黑手臂上的黃豆大的臭汗。</p>
<p>夜市的缺口處，給一些「自由職業者」之羣塡上。</p>
<p>六七個「街頭人像畫家」（恕我用這樣的寫實主義的稱呼吧！）排班似地站在大百貨店的側邊，在兜　着生意，在面前陳列着的他們的種種色色的招牌—不，他們的藝術作品—似乎都多少帶點漫畫風味，而他們自己的瘦白多骨的嘴臉，配上不是一把稻草似的頭髮，就是卸到鼻尖來的過大的黑色眼鏡，頭上或歪着法國式的破帽，或覆着醬紅色的土耳其小帽，以及他們體着他們所抓到的模特兒兼顧客而卽席運筆時的富有靈感的目光和手勢——這一切更構成一幅絕好的活的諷刺畫。諷刺的不是他們自己，而他們自己是諷刺着。</p>
<p>與他們為鄰的是幾攤相士，文質彬彬的文士風的帶有黑外褂的和服攤桌上的盡着八卦點着蠟燭的紙燈籠，給這個現代都會之夜刻上一個時代錯誤」的標記，但是凝」神伸掌給一個長身玉立的老相士執着的，偏巧是一個穿大學生制服的靑年呢。這個標記似乎更　意味。</p>
<p>一個拿剩下來的一條腿站着的木乃伊似的呌化子，一個覆着銅鼓帽，看不見眼鼻的坐着兩輪車的乞丐中的資本家，和在他前頭跪着，頸項掛着一個錢籃的一條黃狗—這齣都市的「新要戲」中雖不重要而必不可少的角色—也已出塲了。到了這一角來，行人們的脚都停一下，但是他們注目看的不是乞錢的人，而是乞錢的狗。這幾個最下層的「自由職業者」恰挿在街頭藝術家和街頭玄學家的中間，或者也有人因此會忽生奇想，以為這裏也象徵着他們彼此的述命的聯繫吧？</p>
<p>霓虹燈的焰越燒得熾熱了，行人觀衆蠢動得越遲緩了，那正是街頭的劇塲「滿員」的時刻了，劇中的名角們呵，在餓倒以前，多賣一點兒氣力吧！</p>
<p>明天還有夜市；但是明天—誰知道明天呢！</p>
<h3 id="c148">孔子絕糧的故事 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>曾在一個報紙的副刊里，談到一個有趣的故事，大概說：</p>
<p>孔子在陳絕糧的時候，一天帶着顏回仲由二個弟子上街，看見一家賣元宵的舖千豎着一塊招牌，上面寫着：「豆沙饀子元宵，一文一個」，孔子就問顏回有綫沒有？回答說：「我是向來沒有綫」。又問仲由，說：「只有一文」。孔子道：「這就有辦法」！於是從懷中掏出一支筆，把招牌上「個字上的「一」字加上一直，變成一個「十」字。</p>
<p>三個人就大搖大擺進去，一共吃了十個元宵，仲由就把他的一文錢掏出來，丟在桌上，堂倌問道：「這是小賬嗎」他們怒道：「吃點心還有小賬」！堂倌當然不承認這就是元宵的代價，於是爭吵起來，孔子呌把招牌拿進來看，果然「一文一個」，變成了「一文十個」。元宵店老板賠罪道；「這大的是我們的掌櫃昨晚吃醉酒，寫錯了字，就收你一文吧」</p>
<p>這才息事。臨出門時，孔子帶鄭重的對元宵店老板說：「你今天幸而遇了我們，因為我們讀書人是憑天理良心做事的，不然把那個「十」字腦袋上加一撇，那可更糟了」。</p>
<p>且不管故事的眞實性，這倒是一個極好的諷刺，詐了人家的宵，還說是「憑天理良心」，不是可為某一種人寫照嗎？不過他們是因為窮得沒有吃，才去施那欺詐手段，這種事却也極普遍。像這一類故事是很多，不見大學生在做强盜竊賊嗎？</p>
<p>一個人受物質的威脅，會逼使他不顧什麽禮義廉恥，去幹那本不是自己願意榦的事。求生是人也是一切動物的本能。使他不能繼續生存，他自然要竭力掙扎，以求生存的維續。要是他們不是窮到這地步，一定不會去詐人家的元宵吃，一個人多少有他的自尊心，就像他們詐了人家的元宵，還掩飾的說是「憑天理良心」，一個做竊賊的，决不肯當人得荒的時候，也就顧不得了。</p>
<p>而怎樣才能使每個人繼續着他們的生存這是一個極重大的問題，這個問題是必須解决，放開這個問題去談別的什麽，那是徒然的。但它需要大家不斷努力，這並不是一件不可能的事，有一個地方不是已完成這一件艱巨的工作？而到了那時候，孔子一定不會再去詐人家元宵吃的。</p>

<p>當船下了吊橋，一湧而入的是無數的脚夫，在這些脚夫的嘈雜中，我感到一種親密，這親密卽是故國霄語的親密。</p>
<p>言語裏蓄着無限的豐富性和親熱性的，這裏包含了自己童年的黃金故事。在自己十幾年的旅的生活裏；聽不到故鄉的言語，己是悠久了。北方話甚至異國的話—在這些毫無情感的言語裏，我感到孤獨和寂寞；然而今日聽到了從脚夫口中所吐的與故鄕相同的言語，所感懷到的依戀和親密是難以叙明的。</p>
<p>呵！這言語，乃是在渺然之間語說着童年　黃金夢吧</p>
<p>可憐的自己，究竟能浸淫在這霄語裏，有多久的時候呢，當天空一碧無雲的九月，不是將重返異國嗎？不是將又離了這可愛的言語嗎？自己不但不能聽到這種言語之聲音，並且連自己都得壓制這聲音的透出，而用另外的言語嗎？</p>

<p>昨棉布市况、轉趨軟弱、蓋海外棉市雄一致堅昂、而國內因時局緊張、謠諑繁興、人心不免慌張、紗花回跌甚勁、致布市亦吿黯淡、東貨細布細斜頗多隨市走銷、售盤因心思不一、故頗有參差、大致疲落每疋二分半五分之譜、然各擋現貨缺乏者仍售原盤、英商恰和廠累磅重磅粗布、因各路銷勢旺盛、現貨派交困難、昨又提高每疋五分、重磅粗布、因軍衣業大　吸收、市上號家手貨空虛、廠盤提高、致市盤上漲頗形在驟、各廠印花整理布疋期貨正圖交解、市面靜而堅、各帮因時局嚴重、金融潮現緊迫、裝貨稍見呆滯、本街批發莊內地帮放賬交易、亦嚴加限制、</p>

<p>十二元、價格似雖較平、不過此種陳宿貨品、略有眼上眼下、聞後市已喊高二十二元五角矣、探悉此次內地之動辦、緣因今庚該處菜油價格昂大、以此種陳宿蔴油做菜油夾裏之需、</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>須有健全的腦力　和超越的智能</p>
<p>不論男女，在人生的歷程上，都必定要經過一個青春時期。在這個時期裏面，是含着十分重要性的，凡人之一生的健康及幸福，都有很大的關係。一般男女青年們呀！我很希望你們要認清自己前途的責任，必須要有健康的驅體和毅勇的志氣！努力的去進取，這才是好男兒大丈夫！千萬別要把這個青春時期淡漠視之，犯上手淫……等等不良的惡習，　傷身體，損害神經，以致精神萎靡不振，形成一個『生無益，死無害』神經衰弱的病夫！</p>
<p>神經衰弱，是青年界男女都容易發生的疾患，所以又稱為青年病。在社會裏面有千萬青年受其蠱毒，呻吟於慘痛生活中。致使前途有為的青年，一變而為可憐無用的殘身，人生幸福，盡付東流。這是何等可怕的疾病呀！</p>
<p>神經衰弱的病徵，大槪是：終日感覺頭暈，頭痛，缺乏生活力，心緒徬徨，思想遲鈍，記憶减退，視力短淺，無勇氣，無决斷力，四肢疲軟，腰　背痛，精神憂鬰，惡夢難眠，胃脹胸痛，消化不良，面容憔悴，雖在壯盛之年，已呈衰邁老態。</p>
<p>神經衰弱，并非不治之病，患者若注意攝養，行有規列之生活，戒除手淫惡習，避免心身過勞，禁用刺戟性食物，內服『米美爾補腦汁』Memory　Neurotio　卽可恢復已衰退之神經活力，生機活潑，則上述一般病徵，自能迅見消失，轉弱為強，得重享人生的福利。</p>
<p>青年們！要知道國難日深一日，未來的國家光榮，未來的民族復興，未來的國家和民族前途的福利，這一副十分艱重而困難的擔子，都是放在你們的肩上，大家不可不注意啊！</p>
<h3 id="c170">肺病療法中以何者爲有效？ <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>肺結核者。從來世人皆調爲不治之症。但至現今。因結核之病理。已經闡明。同時由許多之實地經騐。知肺結核爲可以治愈之疾病。苟施以適當之治療。固得全愈。而世俗　見。恒以肺結核爲不可救藥之痼疾。是於本症治療上。大生妨害。故凡患肺癆者。務宜悟解本症爲可以治愈之疾病。且須堅持其對於治療之决心。此治療上之根本也。</p>
<p>然則肺結核之療法。究以何者爲有效？此實重要之問題。不可不探究也。用强烈之藥。撲滅結核菌（即癆菌）。固爲一般人所想到。但證諸事實。結核菌抵抗力極强。如果以可殺此菌之强烈藥品。使患者服下或者注射。竊恐藥力未及細菌。而人體已先受其害。故患者欲以化學毒烈之藥品。撲滅肺内之結核菌。實爲至愚之思想也。世人有幾千幾百種之療肺藥品。爭售於市。而誇稱其爲撲滅結核菌之特效藥者。此無非藉以迎合病家之心理。而遂其斂錢之目的。至於此等藥品之實效。僅不過輔助患者之消化。與减輕其咳嗽。作爲療養上之補助而已。若患者誤認此類藥品。爲根本療法。實爲大謬也。</p>
<p>觀肺病治療之近况。可謂極其混沌。使人不知擇何法爲佳。故今日欲舉行撲滅結核運動。其最重要者。即爲使一般民衆澈底瞭角肺病之正確與安全療法。以包圍結核之病灶（即肺之病部）。待敵（結核菌）自滅之爲得策。如欲達到此目的。則全在乎增進患者自身之防禦機能（即所謂抵抗力者）。使其强盛。方爲合理。蓋人身之防禦機能强盛。則白血球能將結核菌　困。且於病部之周圍增生結締組織之堤防。築成極堅固之防禦線。使此菌不能奪圍而出。并絶其糧道。於是。結核菌失其活動。而歸死滅。以致肺病可安全痊愈。故吾人欲與結核菌戰。非有此天然强盛之防禦機能。實不足以制其死命也。</p>
<p>欲使肺病得速就治愈。不得不施以適當之方法。以增進患者體内之防禦機能。此種療法。并非化學藥齋所可奏效。惟有臟器療法能達到防禦機能旺盛之目的。患者須確實認識治愈肺病之捷徑。捨臓器療法之外。無更佳之法者。讀者如能將此正確安全之肺病的臟器療法。廣爲傳佈。則世人所受結核之犧牲者。必可大减。以個人而言。欲脱離病苦。免於病死。絶非難事也。</p>
<h3 id="c171">肺病的臓器療法實騐之效 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>德國鐵比亞大藥廠根據上述治愈肺病之原理。參用柏爾託爾特A.　A.　Berthold柏龍石卡Brown　Sequard及史泰林Starling諸大家所發明臟器療法之學説。而採取壯健動物之新鮮肺臟及脾臓。施以科學方法。提煉其中有效成分。（即内分泌素—荷爾蒙者）。再與各種益肺補身等珍貴藥品混合。而製成一種療肺特效内服液。定其名曰『肺活』Phith　Weal。曾經世界各國肺病療養院。作長期臨床試騐。認『肺活』確能使病而衰萎之肺臟能復活。增强其生體臟器之抵抗力。并可增進白血球之喰菌作用。同時鼓舞全體細胞機能而發揮人體天然之防禦力。增殖結締細胞。填補病部之缺損。并在病部周圍築成堡壘形的結締織牆壁。使發硬化。催促疤痕之形成。完全包裏惡魔之結核菌。禁其活動。并受白血球之圍攻。令其自形消滅。故服用此種『肺活』Phith　weal者。能令體内自然産生抗毒素。增加免疫及抗菌作用。</p>
<p>本劑因具有上述諸種特别之效能。世之任何藥物皆不及此臟器製劑『肺活』之合理有效。是爲近世學者所公認也。不論一·二·三期之肺癆。久咳·氣急·咯血·潮熱·盗汗等病症。如已用他種療汉。未得見效者。一經改服『肺活』之後。可於數日内獲得不可思議之效果。倘能</p>
<p>安心服用至二三月之時期。無不痊愈也。</p>
<h3 id="c172">月經不調之家庭療法 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 柏秀貞女醫師</p>
<p>婦女病中之最普遍者爲月經不調。月經痛。無月經等症。凡患此病者决非限於月經一部分之不調不整而已。必也面黄肌瘦·精神懈怠·腰痠背痛·睡眠缺乏·帶下頻多·每致缺少生趣。而妨碍孕育。甚則陷於乾血癆瘵之地步。實屬至可悲觀之病也。蓋月經之不調。并非瘀血有所凝阻。而爲女性生殖機能發生障碍之表現。此機能一有障碍。則全身内分泌腺體。亦同時發生障碍。於是全身之組織。爲之衰退。血液亦漸形枯槁。而容邈遽變灰暗憔悴。致天然之健美豐韻不予稍留。而病乃陷於困苦矣。</p>
<p>月經不調。爲婦科中最普遍之疾病。故調經藥品。亦爲婦科中不可缺少之藥劑。查市上發售之調經藥品。多屬收縮子宫之劇藥。服量過多。每易發生危險。且應用於孕婦。往往致起流産。流弊尤多。兹有「美奴甯」Menoyrin一藥。即依據上述病理之需要以發明也。凡我女同胞患有上述諸症者。如能按時服用。定能獲得經水調順。百病消除。恢復徤康。他如無病之少女常服。可使軀體愈加健康。容貌益形豐韻。婦人常服。益嗣强身。青春永駐。是誠婦女之寶筏。家庭之良藥也。</p>
<h3 id="c173">喘哮氣急之根治療法 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 陸志祥醫師</p>
<p>哮喘病。俗有氣喘痰喘等名稱。至其原因。雖學說甚多。莫衷一是。大槪起於慢性支氣管炎，心臟病，慢性賢臟炎等病。此外尚有神經性氣喘者。亦甚多耳。</p>
<p>哮喘之療法。從前因無完美之藥物。故皆認為極難根治。卽臨床醫家。對於本症。往往有發作時。亦惟藉麻醉劑（嗎啡鴉片）等暫時緩解其痛苦而已。惟此等麻醉劑不宜常用。因恐於中毒之處耳。市間販賣之氣喘藥。大多數含有麻醉劑。雖能立刻生效。但有成癮之弊。</p>
<p>茲有德國DR.　HUMBERT　M.　B.　亨皮耳脫醫學博士根據多年經騐與最新學理。發明一氣喘根治藥。其名『哮立平』Holipin　係一種內服片劑。藥內不含絲毫毒質。雖功效偉大。但無任何副作用。專治老幼各種氣喘。呼吸困難等症。曾經萬國醫師推獎採用。如因慢性支氣管炎而發生之氣喘。或因心臟病而發生之氣喘。或因枯草熱而發生之氣喘。或因肺癆而發生之氣喘。或因神經質而發生之氣喘。或由賢臟炎而發生之氣喘。總之不論原因何在。不論新起久病。無不奏效如神。如氣喘暴發日極險劇之時服之。可立刻見效有起死回生之功。欲施行根本治療者。應於平日連續服用『哮立平』二至三月。大抵均可根本痊愈。永無再復之苦矣。</p>
<h3 id="c174">青春的仇敵　神經衰弱和生殖器的機能障礙 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 沈伯香醫師</p>
<p>神經衰弱，是近來一般所人知道的。最普遍的疾病。論其原因，大槪是由於房事過度或手淫，以致其精力耗竭，神經機能衰萎，元氣大傷，如此，卽呈頭重，眩暈，耳鳴，疲勞，倦怠，記憶减退，精神不安，失眠，健忘，心悸，憂鬰煩悶等顯著的病態。</p>
<p>但以上所說的，是　神經衰弱的一般特徵。此外，同時其生殖器為不健全，而性的障碍，也非常顯著。先起頭是遺精，滑精，夢遺早洩等現象；再進一步，就是陽萎不舉，精液缺乏和不感症等，成為高度的生殖器機能障碍。</p>
<p>因此患者抱有極勵害的精神煩悶終日苦惱，鬰鬰不樂，意氣消沉，减退氣力，如此遠陷入極重的神經衰弱狀態。因而消滅其精力，减弱其體力，以致把青春的幸福，减殺殆盡。</p>
<p>倘若患者不施以適當的治療，結果，大多數要成為虛癆，而喪失了生命。</p>
<p>神經衰弱的救治方法，第一須避免身心過勞，節制性慾，戒除一切不良的惡習慣，改良生活之規律，禁食有刺戟性的物品，整理便通，野外散步，冷水摩擦等，這都是必要實行的衛生方法。是不可以輕忽的。</p>
<p>此外同時應服用滋補神經和強精補賢的兩種藥品。依據診療實騐所得，滋補神經的藥劑，以「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neuratic是神經衰弱的特效品。強精補賢的藥劑，則以睪丸精製成之「還爾童」Well　Tonic為極有效果。凡是生殖器械能不健全所發之性的障碍各種症候，在服用本品之後，都可以逐漸治愈。</p>
<p>以上二種，曾經世界醫師證明，效力可靠，毫無流弊的名藥。患者如在同時進服這兩種藥品，確能於極短期間變弱為強，重享人生樂趣。</p>
<h3 id="c175">自己戒煙特效方法 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 章元貞醫師</p>
<p>當此政府嚴勵禁煙之時。凡吸食毒物者。（如鴉片·嗎啡·紅丸等品）莫不亟思戒除。然戒者又畏懼不前。而意圖茍安者。亦不乏之。察其所以懼戒之心理。無非深恐一旦就戒。不但煙癮未除。反足增致其他疾患。徒加痛苦。甚則慮及生命之危險。世俗對於戒煙恐怖之傳說。已深印人心。故吸者雖是戒除之志。但無勇氣直前以赴之。</p>
<p>敝院對於戒煙方法。曾經相當之研究。診察吸煙者多患神經疲弱。與內分泌不足因此人身精華。遂致枯竭。日漸萎頹。故染有阿芙蓉癖者。皆現神經衰弱之狀態也。欲戒除煙癮。必先強壯神經。此乃根本方策。</p>
<p>如根據上述原理。作戒煙之方針。可收美滿效果。按本院臨床經騐。有志戒煙之人。應於施戒前一月。開始服用內分泌製劑「還爾童」Well　Tonic　每日三次。每次三片。及神經補劑之「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic　每日三次。每次二食匙。服用時期。可照常吸煙。服至一月。即須完全停吸。因此時人身內分泌之機能旺盛。神經強壯。元氣倍增。全身萎頹狀態。均見活力恢復。榮養佳良。故停止吸煙後毫無任何痛苦。反覺舒適愉快。於停止吸煙後。所服之「還爾童」Well　Tonic及「米美爾補腦汁」仍須續用一月方可止服。此時煙癮則於不知不覺中。悄然除去矣。當戒煙期間。倘有遺精症象發生。可服「福郎固精片」Fonan　即可無患。若作為戒煙之補助劑亦可。不論有無遺精。在停止吸煙後。開始內服。祇於臨睡前頓服三片。非獨可預防遺洩。且有催眠之功。</p>
<p>戒煙後之調補。亦屬重要。若無妥善之處置。營養不當。致患者身體瘦弱。精神不安。之調補。未可忽略也。調補藥品。市間雖汗牛充楝。而服者無所適從。蓋合於吸煙者。誠如鳳毛麟角。據本院臨床實騐。其最有效者即為上載之「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic　因本品能壯補神經。造血肥肌。兼能安神止痛。凡吸煙者均現神經疲弱。腦筋不足。貧血贏瘦等象。若服用此藥調補。更有奇效。</p>
<p>上列各種方法與應用藥品。皆由經騐所得。成績優良。較其他任何戒法。此為安全舒適。墨籍同胞。欲解除痛苦。則此捷徑已矣。</p>

<h3 id="c176">慶祝蔣委員長壽辰 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>中宣部通令，本月二十九日為蔣委員長五十壽辰辰，為崇功報德起見，各地一致舉行隆重之慶祝典禮。對於此一盛舉，我們當然也須致其慶祝之意。</p>
<p>綜計蔣委員長自從民國十五年北伐，奠都南京，到現在已整整十個年頭了。在此短短十年之中，中國正經歷了一個歷史上極重大的變化。從奠都南京到九一八，一二八為止，中國的國難開始展開。首當這歷史難關的蔣委員長，對於這一空前國難之襲來，其所担負的任務是異常艱重的。故今日人民在慶祝蔣委員長五十壽辰之際，對於蔣委員長唯一的希望，是怎樣負担起這個太艱重的任務，把這空前的國難打開，挽救這一局殘棋的中國。這是最切要的一點。</p>
<p>今日人民似乎都有這樣一個心願，不問政治取任何形式，我們都贊成，甚至政府要一切人民都肝腦塗地也可以，只要政府能堅决的担負起挽救民族危機的責任，不問是任何人，我們將一致會自動的熟烈的擁護他，給他在中國歷史上留出最崇高地位。且不問他過去曾經是怎樣，他隨時能堅决的担負起這個重大的責任，人民將隨時會熱烈的擁護他。而這挽救民族危機的偉業，却不是放在遼遠的將來，而是此刻要立時兌現。若能如此，任何人能來挺身担起這重任，他將是我們民族復興史上一個最偉的偉人。環顧今日國內，事實上能不用考慮而担起這責任的，只有蔣委員長，那末，我們今日慶祝蔣委員長壽辰，我們就只有以這最崇高最誠懇的希望，進貢於蔣委員長，作為人民進獻的一份最大的禮物罷。</p>
<p>誰都不能否認，中國整個國家，今日已走到了或死或生，不容少有猶豫的岐路點。誠如日本有田所說，中國今日是屈服還是抗爭，須立卽决定，已不能再有所遲疑了。隣人已早代我們决定了民族的命運，難道我們自己不明白？我們深覺滅亡之慘禍，已如火燒眉睫。在此恭祝蔣委員長壽辰之際，因此，對於蔣委員長於全國已統一之時，立刻担起為民族爭生存大任，這是我們最大而最切的唯一的希望！</p>
<p>蔣委員長前曾宜言對外退讓最低限度，卽是如敵人再來進犯一寸土地，必立予還擊。可是今日敵人也有不用形式上進佔土地，而暗暗換去了中國江山的事實，如近日喧傳之華北五省聯盟便是。對於這種變相進佔士地的侵略，我們異常深切的希望蔣委員長不要放鬆才好。末了大家齊聲高喊：擁護蔣委員長　今日唯一攘外救國的英雄！</p>
<h3 id="c177">鐃皷聲裏 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒衡</p>
<p>下午近七點鐘，樓下的胡琴停了，桌子椅子的移動聲又響起來。根據過去的經騐，我猜度她們又要打牌了。然而這猜度却又落了空，—響起來的倒是一片鐃皷。</p>
<p>「今天的文章又寫不成了，看吧，她們又在做五七。」老李忿忿地丟開手里的筆。</p>
<p>「這呌做「事由天定」，說不得我們只有暫時玩一會；不過藉這機會　點熱鬧也好。」我推開稿紙走到窗前。</p>
<p>我所住的屋子是二樓的前樓，二房東的一家便住在樓上，也許因為屋子不够住，她們把門里一方大小的天井也罩上了玻璃頂，吃飯，會客，打牌便在這</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>下邊。我們只要推開窗子俯下頭去，便可烏瞰這一切了。</p>
<p>「你看這些傢伙不像和尙也不是道士，大概是尼姑吧？」老李指着樓下燈光里憧憧的人影說。</p>
<p>「不，尼姑是不會有頭髪的，我看倒像是道姑。」我低聲說。顯然老李的話被她們聽見了。兩個蓬鬆的頭影抬起看我們一下，接着無表情地又俯下去。而繼續着是一片聽不淸楚的經聲或咒語。</p>
<p>樓下的佈置，也此平日有點改變；迎門放着一張方桌，桌上供着一個用黃紙糊的靈牌。因為是直立的，所以看不淸是什麽字，我想大概又是「州公諱××州靈位。靈牌的兩邊，點着兩　白燭，灼灼地發着橙色的暗光。正中是一個金屬的香爐，挿着三枝草香。幾個道姑，圍坐在桌子的三面。每人手里拿着一伴樂器，是，皷，鐃，銅鈴，木魚。前兩件，只有開始和煞尾時才響一陣，木魚和銅鈴則好像是一種節拍，隨着抑揚的經聲不斷地響下去。</p>
<p>她們誦着什麽經，這點不只我不知道，便是請她們誦經的二房東，怕也不會曉得我盡力想聽出一句或兩句，結果一個宇也聽小懂，便也放棄這個計劃。橫豎她們是在「誦經」，只這一點已會使主人滿意，餘外的探求，倒是屬於多事了。</p>
<p>經聲停了，　着鏡皷傳來一陣號哭聲，那好像是在樓下死者從前住過的屋子里，哭的也好像都是女人，覺着淸亮而又尖銳，似乎要衝破一切空間的障碍，而穿進每個人的心里。</p>
<p>「你聽，那最淸脆的大概是二房東的大女兒了，」老李倚着墻聽着對我說</p>
<p>「眞怪，平時從未看見她們有過一點憂戚和難過，怎麽哭時會這樣的號咷？」他聽了一會又說。</p>
<p>「把世事看得太認眞的，是會不知不覺的上當，」我點起一枝烟吸着。「我們自詡為聰明人的，在她們眼里常會是傻子。你只知道哭是人類威情的流露，而不知道哭也是人類禮俗上的一種形式。所以哭在我們非眞具有其一切應備的條件，是假扮不來的：她們在這方面的成就，却比我們高明得多，因為她們已把它技術化和職業化了。」我一面吸着烟，一面慢騰騰地說。老李却不出聲地搖着頭，好像表示我的話並未能使他滴意。</p>
<p>這時哭聲已終止了，樓梯上送來一陣高跟鞋的革革響聲，似乎幾隻脚在那里賽跑。</p>
<p>「看，她們的表演已經結束了，要開始另一種新把戲了。」我微笑地看着老李，脚聲已走進了鄰室。</p>
<p>「阿姐哭得交關好。」一個女孩子的聲音。我猜那是老三。</p>
<p>「爸爸啊——你為啥弗帶了我去—」另一個聲音在仿效着。我想這或許是那位淡紫旗袍的堂客。</p>
<p>「吃吃…」一陣笑聲夾雜着戲謔和扭打。我對老李裝一個鬼臉。</p>
<p>「這不是你的新發現，你不用得意忘形。實在說你所說的「哭已被職業化了，」却早已在實行，上海還有僱人代哭的，你知道嗎？」他不服氣地說，我沒有回答，隔壁的牌聲便響了。</p>
<p>「阿金，到樓下瞧着，要哭的時候喊我們」老大說。</p>
<p>「我眞不能再住了，下月你不肯搬時我要一個人搬去，」老李煩惱地抓着頭髮。</p>
<p>「老李，不要忘了我們這是「體騐生活呀！」我笑着對他說。</p>
<p>「滾他媽的，我不需要這種的生活！」</p>
<p>「不要高聲！二小姐的「蘇三起解」又唱了。」我搖着手吿訴他。</p>
<p>「蘇三離了洪桐縣，將身來在大街前，末從開言……」沒有唱完，便被樓下的鐃皷聲打斷了。</p>
<h3 id="c178">弄堂卽景 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 因非</p>
<p>孩子們在弄堂裏玩得挺高興，幾個人攪做一團的在搶着小皮球。他們的汗流在臉上，很迅速的把手背抹了一抹便算完了事，臉上，也頓時留了條黑色的痕跡，但這些他們全不管，一面抹着汗，一面又很勇敢的衝到戰團中去搶球了</p>
<p>他們踢球沒有一定的規則，也沒有球門，祗是搶球在誰的脚上時候多，誰便是最能耐的一個，這個人也一定頗為威風的邊踢着球邊喊：你們來搶，來搶呀！</p>
<p>於是其餘的人便擠做一團的擁了上去，合力同心的把球搶過來，但當球被搶過來了，那個人又變做孤立的英雄，共餘的人又圍着他來搶了。</p>
<p>他們便無休無止的這樣搶着搶着。</p>
<p>正當他們搶得挺高興的時候，遠遠地却傳來一個聲音：</p>
<p>「喂！大老爺來了！鏘！鏘！」</p>
<p>那個人穿了一身簇新的藍布工裝，背上揷了三四面紙旗，（卽是從香斗上拿下來的）嘴裏不知還在嚼着什麽，使得說話的聲音有些含糊。</p>
<p>「小榮！小榮！」有幾個站定了，有幾個却依舊玩他們的。</p>
<p>小榮走過來了；他顯得戲台上的將軍那樣子，學着戲子的口白：「老夫趙雲，勿斬無名小卒，快些報上名來！</p>
<p>看沒有人和他搭口，便改着語氣，搭訕着說：「二毛，你看這旗子，是爸爸買回來的，還有香斗，還有月餅，這麽大這麽大的一包，還有，還有……」</p>
<p>「還有屁！」</p>
<p>不知是誰頂了一句。那個便兇狠狠的衝了出來：</p>
<p>「誰說的？你連屁也沒有！」</p>
<p>搶着球統的全停止了。有一個跳了出來：</p>
<p>「我說的，怎樣？」</p>
<p>「二毛，揍他！我有月餅，我跟你好！」他果然拿出一個月餅來，挖開了，分一半二毛。</p>
<p>二毛看看那邊又看看這邊，他不敢伸出手來去接。</p>
<p>那個可向他扮着鬼臉，冷冷地從鼻子裏發出聲音來：「哼！你們敢！」他向四面看了看，帶着一點問號，「我們的人多！」</p>
<p>「我有月餅！我家裏還有許多許多！」</p>
<p>「我們不要喫月餅。我們也有。」不知是誰說的。</p>
<p>「對，我們不要喫月餅，我們也有。」很多的人相應着。</p>
<p>「你們祗有屁，你們喫屁，喫屁呀！喫屁呀！耶姆耶姆好喫，一隻花花小狗看我喫！」</p>
<p>「你們才吃屁！」那個憤憤地把皮球擲了過去，把背上的紙旗擲破了。</p>
<p>淚珠掛在小榮的眼眶內，他想衝過去，但是他不敢，終於，他顫聲地：「二毛，打他！我等會兒再給你喫月餅。」</p>
<p>二毛望望那邊又望望這邊，終於開口了：「阿炳，你為什麽要弄破他的旗子呢？」</p>
<p>「關你屁事，你忘記他前天呌別人打你了？」</p>
<p>那個總說住了，但還是辯着說：「今天總是你不好呀，他又沒有惹你」。</p>
<p>「月餅的味道好呀。你前天有沒有惹他？」他頓了頓，「有程，一個跟一個打好了，打死人不償命，大家都不許哭！」</p>
<p>「好！一個跟一個打，誰帮誰都是烏龜王八蛋養的。」</p>
<p>「你先賠我的旗子，我不管」！</p>
<p>「那麽昨天你扯破我的衣服為什麽不賠呢」？</p>
<p>「衣服又不是我扯破的」。</p>
<p>「旗子也不是我扯破的，是皮球呀！」</p>
<p>「那麽你把皮球拿出來，讓我也把它弄破了好了」。</p>
<p>「尿」！</p>
<p>「不要管他，阿炳，我們來踢皮球。」</p>
<p>於是他們又說起來了。</p>
<p>二毛望望那邊又望望這邊，他倚在墻上不知應該怎樣才好。</p>
<p>小榮根：他盯了了他一眼，說：「我下次不跟你好了，騙月餅喫」！他括着臉羞他。然後，像是另外發現條途徑似地：「阿炳，你不要狠，我吿訴你爸爸去」！</p>
<p>孩子們全沒理他，玩得挺高界的。月亮已掛在天邊了，圓圓的。</p>

<p>「你這掃帚精！克夫星！你一來，就弄得家里一刻都不太年，不太平，阿利多病時痛。沒看，給你克得沒有一點肉，沒有一點肉。他的肉都被你克去了，看你胖得像猪一樣的。你這掃帚星精！克夫精」！做阿公約氣唬唬的用指尖很命向媳婦臉上觸過去，那個長不滿三尺的，拖着二條黃濃鼻涕的媳婦，像西瓜號的滾到地上了。</p>
<p>媳婦嗚的哭起來啦！</p>
<p>做阿公約在桌子上摸到一根尺，豎起他的刷字眉冀：「哼！你敢哭」！比軍營里的命令還靈騐。她抹了一把鼻涕，立刻止住了哭聲。做阿公約這才有靈氣平。他回頭去望望躺在行軍床上的獨養兒子阿利。棉被平平的，看不出有入睡在那里，露在被口的頭，像醫院里浸在藥水瓶里的沒有什麽多大的二樣，祗是二顆陷得深深眼睛子，忽瞧猛烈地咳起來，痰白沫似的吐出來。他父親見見痰里面有着紅絲。</p>
<p>「怎麽？阿利，你吐血了嗎」？父親着急了，急得手脚都沒有放處，祇是澄着脚。他一眼望到他的媳婦站在衣橱旁邊滿不在乎的瞅着自己，他一肚子怨氣正沒出外，走上去，拍的一下巴掌，把她臉上的黃濃鼻涕都打在掌心里，他氣極了抓住她的小辮子把拖過來，又是一下巴掌，打得她目瞪口呆，不知自己犯下了什麽大罪。</p>
<p>「你這掃帚精，克夫星！阿利咳得這樣厲害，你不知道上來帮帮。却呆呆的望着。你在咒咀他死嗎？他死了，我决不讓你這掃帚精活着再去別人。你這打不死的小妖精」！說罷，又是一記巴掌，把她打在地上。</p>
<p>阿利看着父親打人，好像已經看慣了似的。他咳了一陣，平靜下來了。眼皮罩上了眼珠。親父看看兒子腄着了。跌了像蝸牛似的屈伏在地上的媳婦一脚，也疲倦的躺到床上去了。</p>
<p>這小小的庭子里，就祗有昏黃的媒油燈火陪着地上的媳婦。</p>
<p>「爸！爸！阿利忽又睜開眼。「的床上棕棚太鬆了，睡得背骨怪痛的。」</p>
<p>「呌阿香替你頂棕棚，」父親坐了起來：「阿香，你鑽到阿利床底下，替他頂棕棚，去，快去！」</p>
<p>阿香望着阿公冒着火燄的眼睛，垂頭喪氣的鑽進阿利的床底下去了。</p>
<p>父親這才安心的睡下去，問了一聲：「現在怎麽樣」？兒子沒有回答他。</p>
<p>桌上的鬧鐘響得很重。可是鼾聲響得此它更重。</p>
<p>「爸！爸！」阿利瘋似的從床上這跳起來：「爸！快起來，我床底下有鬼……鬼在呌啊！」</p>
<p>父親也嚇得直跳起來，父子二個臉色全嚇得像紙那麽的。他們戰競競的　着，果然，床底下有　聲音，阿利　　他父親的腰不放。父　壯一壯膽，在</p>

<p>鈎上拿下一把「銅錢寳劍」，一曲拿了煤油燈，用劍去打開床前一塊布一看一看的有一個東西在那里。但當他把煤油燈放得近些看時，不是別的，是他的媳婦睡在那里。他氣瘋了。一下子把她從床底下拖出來。拿起尺，不問情由的向她頭上，臉上，一陣亂打。</p>
<p>「你這掃帚精，克夫骨，你想把阿利嚇死嗎「……」</p>
<p>一陣亂打。打得胳膊酸了，方停住手。一陣亂駡，駡得厭了，方停住了嘴</p>

<p>一個貿易經紀人的德國人，正坐在許爾的鄰座，於是就自告奮勇的做許爾的翻譯。</p>
<p>船長懇求上帝保持德法兩國間的和平，增加友愛。</p>
<p>另外一個致詞者是一個德人商業顧問官的連長，他演說是帶了些驕傲和命令式的態度。他說：「法國人都是一些大孩子，快樂，聰明，不能預料未露端倪的事，如果能和德國人合作，才能鞏固二個國家的國勢，而同去抵抗一個公敵。」說完，這位連長也就舉杯慶祝法國了。</p>
<p>不料，那位實業家（連長）又用一種不平的態度說：「法國對於我們卻顯出抱怨的氣槪，我們的凱撒，好多年來就用名貴正直的態度，向法國伸手為禮，而法國卻裝着沒有看見，您各位將來會明白這件事是不對的。」不料許爾卽說：「在指望法國人的友誼之前，貴國或者不妨把從他們那邊拿過來的東西歸還他們。」這幾句話說完了，空氣就沉寂下來。</p>
<p>「歸還！」這商業顧問官繼續說：「我們沒有一點甚麽可以歸還他們，理由就是我們並沒有拿過甚麽，現在我們管着的東西，是從我們的英雄主義掙得來的。」而許爾却接着說：「這正像我盜了您的表，而後來我又向您提議要做朋友，並且要忘記過去一樣，卽令您有饒我的傾向，我是不是在事前應該歸還您的表。」</p>

<p>中央日報——　寫　時官僚腐敗情狀，扮演各員異常老練，導演手法，亦多可取之處。尤可貴者，國產中華通收　，成績極佳，全片　　，甚為清晰，光線亦佳，攝影與剪接，亦臻上乘，在幼稚之國產影片，詳為不可多得之佳片。</p>
<p>朝報——看後過一想，簡單的意見，是：只觉得史东山君大胆可嘉。</p>
<p>朝報——唱歌那一幕，　萍和周璇在　　效果上的收　，實在有莫大的成功，真是各有千秋。</p>
<p>新民報——佈景與和音樂，都較該公司前幾部片子有了顯著的進步。演員方面如金山（假巡按）與　而已（安唐）是　成功的，胡萍那淫浪姿態，永遠保持其和度的標準，的是一條迷人的狐貍精。</p>
<p>新民報——全部的對白，是很好的一本官場格　　。發誓的嘹亮，開了中國片的新紀元，此乃不可抹煞的事實。</p>
<p>南京日報——全劇充滿著幽默諷刺的笑料，導演手法之簡潔，以及賞之稱職，可說是　合當沒有了——是新華最精湛的作品。</p>
<p>扶輪日報——「狂歡之夜」因有好的賣本，益充賞以現實生動的材料，故可算是中西影片空前的巨製。</p>
<p>華報——全國含有惡毒的諷刺，是　　寫實的幽默大喜劇——從整個部分演出看來，史東山是已收到圓滿的效果了。</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Issue of Moving the Chief Inspectorate Office to the North: No Decision Yet; Smuggling to Shandong Gradually Decreasing <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Tonghua came to Tianjin from Beiping on the morning of the 1st to discuss matters. He met with Zhang Weifan. Regarding the establishment of a branch office of the Chief Inspectorate on the PingSui Railway, he personally felt it was unnecessary. Whether or not the Chief Inspectorate Office will move north has not been decided. The customs and anti-smuggling forces here are sufficient to handle the situation, so there is no need for another agency. Therefore, Ainslie will not come north for the time being. He will wait in Tianjin for instructions from the Ministry of Finance to discuss anti-smuggling measures with various parties in Tianjin. He has not yet decided when he will return to Nanjing. Large amounts of smuggled goods entering Hebei and Chahar have been negotiated in Tianjin with Li Qingxuan to form a committee to investigate and levy supplementary taxes. However, this is still a temporary measure and not a thorough solution. Smuggling of goods from Tianjin to northern Shandong via the Jinji Highway has decreased after a section of the highway near the Shandong border was destroyed, preventing cars from passing. The situation along the PingHan Railway is also good, with numerous branch inspectorates deployed. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to news from the Jinpu Railway Bureau, at 1:54 a.m. on the 1st, the No. 306 Pingpu through train collided with the No. 267 freight train south of Liuquan Station, killing two railway workers and injuring 15 passengers, one security guard, and nine railway workers. Two locomotives, one passenger car, and five freight cars were damaged to varying degrees. The accident was caused by the freight train driver directly entering the station. In addition to the Railway Bureau immediately rushing to carry out rescue work nearby and sending the injured to Gushishan Station for medical treatment, Director Xie of the Traffic Department and others went to the scene of the accident at 9:40 a.m. to investigate and supervise the handling of the aftermath.

The upstream and downstream passenger and freight trains on the line were all open to traffic by 3 p.m. on the 1st. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 1:45 a.m. on the 1st, the southbound No. 306 passenger train on the Jinpu Railway collided with the northbound No. 267 freight train south of Liuquan Station, destroying two locomotives and one passenger car. Two mechanics were killed, two passengers were seriously injured, twelve were slightly injured, one railway police officer, and nine railway workers. A section of the track was destroyed. The accident was caused by the freight train driver disregarding signal markers and proceeding north past the station. Upon receiving the report, the Tianjin office of the Jinpu Railway immediately dispatched a rescue train carrying workers to repair the tracks and transport the injured to nearby stations for treatment. Traffic was restored after more than three hours of obstruction. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Jinpu No. 306 train and the No. 267 freight train collided at Liuquan Station. The southbound No. 305 train changed to No. 306 to go north after arriving at Liuquan, arriving in Jinan 11 hours late. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The train crash on the Jinpu Railway on the 1st at Liuquan caused the most damage to the southbound freight train. The northbound locomotive from Tianjin was also destroyed and inserted into a third-class carriage, destroying a total of three third-class carriages, one dining car, and one second-class carriage.

Those who were slightly injured and those who escaped unharmed mostly changed trains at Liuquan and went north. The seriously injured were transported to Xuzhou for medical treatment. The cause of the accident was that the driver of the southbound train was careless and did not close the air brakes when entering the station on a downhill slope, so he could not stop. At the same time, the area is a large bend, and the hills on both sides obstruct the line of sight, so the driver did not see the train outside the station, which caused the accident. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) At 1:53 a.m. on the 1st, the southbound coal and freight mixed train on the Jinpu Railway entered Liuquan Station. Due to the rapid speed of the train on the downhill slope, the locomotive failed to stop and passed beyond the signal, colliding with the No. 306 Pingpu express train parked within the yard. The collision destroyed locomotive No. 412 and three third-class passenger cars from the Pingpu train, as well as locomotive No. 121 and two freight cars. Firemen Liu Enze and Shan Tinghui were killed. Car guard Wang Shulin, hookmen Zhang Yushan and Xu Baoshan, and passengers He Yujun and Bai Yuzhi, among others, were seriously injured. Passengers Ren Chongwen, Huang Jinping, Li Wenzhang, Yue Weifu, Zhang Yongsheng, Chen Jingdeng, Qiu Zaixun, Liu Weixuan, Zhou Qiabang, as well as railway police Ren Jinxing, Zhang Fengde, and Zuo Zhenji, and railway workers Han Hongjun, hookman Guo Yunshan, Liu Qingchuan, and 30 tea attendants were slightly injured. Both drivers, Zhang Fengying and Yuan Shaoxian, are missing. After receiving the report, the Xuzhou Station immediately dispatched a rescue train to the scene of the accident. The section chiefs of the locomotive, engineering, and police departments personally led their employees to investigate and transport the dead and injured to Xuzhou for treatment. The vehicles destroyed on both sides are lying across the mountain road, making it extremely difficult to remove them. It will take about 20 hours to repair and reopen the line. In order to maintain traffic, the Railway Bureau is having all passengers change trains at the site. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Currently, the destroyed vehicles are lying across the mountain road, and the engineering department is stepping up their removal.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters, based on a letter from the Chief Supervisor of Overseas Chinese Elections, requested an interpretation as to whether foreign ambassadors and consuls could be considered current officials and whether they had the right to be elected. The Headquarters recently replied that ambassadors, ministers, chargés d'affaires, consuls-general, consuls, and vice-consuls all have direct or indirect relations with the overseas Chinese in their stationed locations and are naturally considered officials of various levels. They should be subject to the restrictions of Article 58 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Election Law and may not be elected as overseas Chinese representatives in their stationed countries or locations. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice has approved interpretations on questionable points in election lawsuits: (1) Investigations into election crimes should follow ordinary criminal procedure, with the local court as the court of first instance; (2) Election lawsuits refer to the lawsuits mentioned in Articles 56 and 57 of the Election Law. If an election violates the criminal law, it should still be handled by the local court prosecutor and criminal court according to ordinary criminal procedure. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice has approved interpretations on three questionable points in election lawsuits: (1) If an administrative supervisor commits a crime due to their identity as an election supervisor, it should naturally be tried by an ordinary court; (2) Before the entire district election is completed, if a complaint is filed about the illegality of supervision in a section that has already been elected within the district, the progress of the election should be taken into consideration to avoid hindering it; (3) Articles 56 and 57 of the Election Law stipulate the dates for lawsuits. If a complaint is filed after the deadline, is it acceptable to process the case? If not, should it be rejected or dismissed without prejudice? As the law does not provide a clear regulation, it should be handled according to the law of procedure. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Fengtai Travelogue <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>Fengtai is a small town south of Beiping, belonging to the special municipality of Beiping, known throughout the Beiping-Tianjin area for its production of flowers, fruits, vegetables, and the like. Since the White Russian Mutiny, the "friendly nation's" troops have occupied warehouses, built barracks, and held endless exercises. This year, misunderstandings between Chinese and Japanese troops have repeatedly occurred, and the "September 18th" incident shook the entire nation when another misunderstanding between the two armies arose. Thus, this tiny town has become famous throughout the country under the name of the "nest of trouble." In reality, it is the throat between Beiping and Tianjin. Further west, all the way to the Lugou Bridge on the Beiping-Hankou Railway, it is part of the "friendly nation's" military stronghold. The railways passing through here include the Beining Railway and the branch line from Beiping to Lugou Bridge. Although the town is small, its strategic importance is extraordinary. After the "September 18th" incident was resolved, a part of our 19th Route Army garrison withdrew from the town; therefore, the local situation in the past ten days or so has become the focus of attention for a group of people in society.</p>
<p>Fengtai is about twenty kilometers, or forty Chinese li, from Zhengyangmen in Beiping. It takes half an hour by express train and more than two hours by slow train, which stops at four stations along the way. In order, they are Zhengyangmen in Beiping, Dongbiandou, Yongdingdou, and finally Fengtai. The reporter took the Beining Line No. 23 Pingyu express train from Zhengyangmen Station at 1:00 PM. The weather was fine and sunny along the way, and the sorghum swayed incessantly, a sea of ​​ocher-yellow as far as the eye could see. Occasionally, where the corners of houses and mud walls were exposed, there were always advertisements for Daxue Eye Drops, Lao Du Eye Drops, Ajinomoto, Wei Huo, Jintan, Zhongjiang Tang, Hongxing Partridge Vegetables, and the like. These advertisements are arranged in an exceptionally neat manner. Along the forty or fifty li from Zhengyangmen to Fengtai, various advertisements take turns appearing on the walls and corners of houses in the countryside, without overcrowding or omissions. It is conceivable that some kind of unified arrangement procedure has been gone through, which is not yet known. The area of ​​the advertisements is unusually large, entirely filling the entire wall surface, leaving no gaps. All the walls that can be seen from the train are plastered with them. For dozens of miles, what comes into view are rows and rows of what appear to be billboards with roofs, which can also be described as a spectacle.</p>
<p>This train has more than a dozen cars of first, second, and third class. The reporter inspected each car, and there were few passengers in the first and second class cars. Ten minutes after the train left the station, in the first-class dining car, the reporter witnessed a fat waiter in a white uniform dozing off at the table, drooling nearly three inches. This shows how idle and inactive they were. The third-class cars were crowded with passengers, but most of them were going to Tianjin and the Tangshan area. Only a few people planned to go to Shanhaiguan and then leave the pass to go to the puppet "Manchukuo." When the reporter spoke to one of them, the person was tight-lipped, holding his leather bag tightly, as if afraid of being questioned. There were three or five vagrants of a certain country, wearing cheap cloth suits without ties, walking back and forth in each car; the leather shoes without laces lazily dragged back and forth on the iron floor of the car, making a constant "ti ta" sound. Sometimes they would suddenly stop and stare at the passengers, as if paying close attention. But as soon as the passenger looked back at them, they would show an indifferent expression and wander away. Whether there was anything of note remains unclear, making people unsure what to believe. In the third-class car, there were a dozen or so lamas and dozens of Han people from the Wuchuan area of ​​Suiyuan Province, occupying a section of the car exclusively. The lamas were all wearing maroon robes, but they were very greasy. Each person held a string of prayer beads in their hand, muttering words. The Han people were all wearing blue cloth gowns, red-topped melon-skin hats, with long hair dragging three or four inches behind their heads. Those who occasionally took off their hats had their foreheads and tops of their heads shaved very cleanly, still in the style of the long braid era. It is conceivable that the long braids may have been recently cut off, which is not yet known. Of their speech, only a few simple words such as "Tianjin," "Wuchuan," and "Taiping" could be understood. However, from these simple words, it can be known that they came to Beiping from Wuchuan and were transferring to Tianjin. And the current situation in Wuchuan (the reporter notes that this place is an important route from eastern to western Suiyuan, and Wang Ying's bandits often traveled back and forth here) can be roughly known from the word "Taiping." As for their purpose in going to Tianjin, because communication was difficult, after many inquiries, it was impossible to find out the key point.</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM, the train arrived at Fengtai Station. The vagrants in the car also swarmed off the train here, and the reporter followed them. Fengtai is a small town. Apart from the area near the station, there are very few people in the town who are neatly dressed. Only vagrants of a certain country often stroll through the dilapidated streets in clumsy suits. Therefore, anyone wearing a suit who doesn't talk much is in danger of being suspected as a person from the "friendly nation." When the reporter walked through the streets, he felt that he was being stared at by passers-by everywhere. At first, he didn't know why, but after paying more attention, he realized that their eyes actually contained two kinds of meanings: fear and disgust. Having been suspected as a person from the "friendly nation," he felt a blockage in his heart, as if he had swallowed something greasy, an indescribable discomfort. But the vagrants seemed to look at me with the eyes of their own kind, which was completely different from the contemptuous and teasing gaze they gave to the local residents, which was quite ridiculous. But thinking about being in this "nest of trouble," without any guarantee, and at risk of being teased at any time, it is better to take advantage of this uncertain suspicion, which can make one feel slightly safer. Therefore, he remained silent and relied entirely on his eyes to make a rough observation of everything. In reality, even if he inquired in many ways, I am afraid that no one would dare to tell him the situation.</p>
<p>The street is about a li long, and signs of decline can be seen everywhere. The social order is superficially stable, but the suffocating air of being under some kind of heavy pressure can also be felt everywhere. The street is a north-south street, and the market is only on one side. The houses are not opposite each other across the street, but all face east, facing the station. In front of the street, there is a small ditch two or three feet wide, winding from south to north, with a length equal to that of the street. Dirty water flows gurglingly, and the sunlight evaporates, filling the air with stench. "Friendly nation" troops carrying weapons can be seen coming and going constantly. Outside the town, there is a faint sound of artillery and machine guns, intermittently transmitted. This is because that day happened to be the first day of a large-scale exercise. As for the gray uniforms of our country's army, I had seen one at the Shuidimen Station on this trip. As for the streets of Fengtai, they were even more invisible.</p>
<p>While walking through the streets, there was a sound of gongs and drums, coming from the south of the street and echoing the rumbling artillery and the staccato machine guns from afar. Following the sound, I suddenly saw a white cloth flag more than ten feet wide, flying horizontally in the air. From afar, I could clearly identify the large characters "Japan-China Joint Wufeng Grand Theater" on it. When I arrived at the door, I saw that two large Chinese national flags and a certain country's sun-shaped national flag were crossed and inserted on the door, which felt very incongruous. The so-called grand theater was just a tall shed made of mats. Three or five vagrants were lined up in front of the door, loudly soliciting passers-by. When the reporter arrived at the door, he hesitated slightly, but this had already attracted their special attention. Their eyes were shining and fixed on me without any rest, so it was better to make a decisive decision. He strode into the venue with a lofty and wide gait. At this time, they suddenly changed their previous attitude and did not ask the reporter for a ticket, only announcing after letting me pass, "Buy a ticket to see the show," "Buy a ticket to see the show." Even if I ignored them, I suppose they would not necessarily come to ask for it again. However, the reporter still took out a dime ticket, bought a ticket, and entered. When buying the ticket, I was also given a so-called "gift lucky draw ticket." According to its explanation, customers can choose any number from 1 to 40. At the end of the show, a lottery is held, and there is hope of winning a prize. At the back of the venue, there was a long table, and a red paper was posted on the wall, stating "Military and Police Control Seat." In front of it, sat a person wearing a Western-style autumn overcoat on top and Chinese-style cotton pants on the bottom, holding a civilization cane. Presumably, this person was the so-called "military police." This person sat and lay uneasily, constantly making teasing gestures to the customers. The reporter witnessed him hooking up the bound feet of an old woman from the countryside with the curved handle of his civilization cane. The old woman almost fell over, screamed in alarm, and quickly pulled her foot back. The person then quickly hooked the old woman's other foot with his cane, causing screams to continue. The person then clapped his hands and laughed. The seats in the venue were divided into male and female sections, separated by wooden fences. In each section, there were more than a hundred long wooden benches. Of the five or six hundred seats, there were surprisingly few empty ones, with three or four hundred people seated, which could not help but make me sigh. The customers were all from the lower classes of society. I really don't know where this one dime ticket came from. Was their purpose in coming here for entertainment, or solely for the lucky draw? And the ignorant and foolish state between their eyebrows, with a silly and silly smile, made me feel even more heartache when I saw it. On the stage, there were as many as five or six people playing instruments, and the singers were two children around ten years old. These two children would naturally make eye contact with the audience, which was extremely sad. The singing was shrill, like a chicken crowing, and it was impossible to tell what they were singing. Just as the reporter was raising his eyes to look around the venue, he suddenly heard a strange sound of "hao yi hao yi," which arose in a roar. He quickly looked at the stage and saw a female actor of fifteen or sixteen years old, coming out of the stage door, twisting and pinching as she walked towards the center of the stage. Two people, similar to railway workers, were whispering to each other at this time. One said: "Wow, look at that wave." The other said: "It's a pity she's lame." Thereupon, one of them loudly questioned: "Who said that?" The other also shouted loudly: "I saw it myself." The two argued endlessly, until they made a bet and went to the stage near the stage to see what was really going on. At this point, the reporter felt nauseous and could no longer bear it, so he left his seat and exited the venue, without seeing who won or lost.</p>
<p>Following the dirty and stinking ditch, I walked north along the street, intending to find a restaurant to eat and take the opportunity to see the situation, but I couldn't find one for a long time. When I reached the north end of the street, I finally saw a dilapidated restaurant. And next to it, there was a white wall with the words "Korean Cuisine" on it. I originally intended to go inside the white wall to see what it was like, but later, seeing a group of vagrants coming out from inside, I was afraid of causing trouble, so I stopped. After stepping into the dilapidated restaurant, flies swarmed and flew around, and there were no customers inside. But in a moment, I suddenly saw a person wearing a Western-style shirt with a tie on the upper body and khaki riding pants and black leather boots on the lower body, sharpening a pencil with a kitchen knife more than a foot long in front of the stove. The reporter chose a seat next to him, intending to see what was going on. On the table where this person was sitting, there was a bulging black leather bag, and in front of him was a notepad. He was not eating or drinking, but huddled in a corner, smoking a cigarette and pondering. Sometimes, he would scribble on the paper, not knowing what he was writing. When talking to the waiter, he was vague and difficult to understand, and mostly relied on gestures to help. This person was probably from the "friendly nation." I don't know what his mission was in lying here silently.</p>
<p>After leaving the restaurant, I continued north. When I was near the barracks of a certain country, I saw a dozen or so idlers standing on the side of the road. Two of them were arguing and wrestling. One side was a rickshaw puller, and the other side was a vagrant from a certain country. The vagrant was wearing a gray suit and punching the other person in the chest from time to time, muttering words in his mouth, not knowing what he was saying; but judging from his attitude and expression, it seemed to be vicious curses. The rickshaw puller stood still and took the blows, not daring to fight back. But as soon as the vagrant turned around to leave, he quickly grabbed the back collar of his suit and refused to let go, not caring about receiving even more violent punches as a result. According to the rickshaw puller, the matter they were arguing about was that when he stopped the rickshaw, a large copper coin fell out of his pocket and was picked up by the vagrant, who refused to return it. The rickshaw puller was old and simple, so what he said was probably true. After the vagrant tried to leave several times without success, he suddenly roared and pointed to the barracks that were close at hand, intending to drag the rickshaw puller inside. While they were wrestling, a team of young "friendly nation" soldiers returning from an exercise carried several machine guns back to the camp. Seeing this, the rickshaw puller quickly wiped his tears, picked up his rickshaw, and rushed away. The onlookers also scattered like birds and beasts. The vagrant strutted away triumphantly.</p>
<p>Around [time], the reporter returned to the station. After climbing onto the Beiping-Tianjin slow train, I finally felt a sense of relief and took a long breath. But when I saw the sun-shaped national flag of the "friendly nation" barracks erected high in the sky, I couldn't help but feel sorrow rising from within, and my chest felt bound.

<h3 id="e46">The Significance of Japan's Control of the North China Paper Industry <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese paper industry capitalists, following the will of the military, have been preparing to establish large-scale paper mills in Tianjin, in an attempt to monopolize China's paper industry. The Toyo Paper Manufacturing Company plans to invest 10 million yuan to build a paper mill on the Haihe River in Tianjin Special Area and continue to establish branch factories in the five provinces of North China. Those responsible for the preparations are mostly important figures in the military. The Osaka Joint Paper Manufacturing Company has also purchased 3,000 mu of land in Dazhigu, Tianjin Special Area, with capital of 5 million yuan, to prepare for a paper mill. Japan's plan to develop the economy of North China is comprehensive, but the government uniquely recognizes the control of the paper industry as a major part of its national policy and must be implemented in advance, which has profound intentions. If this plan is completed, not only will China's paper industry, newspaper industry, publishing industry, and all cultural undertakings be greatly affected.</p>
<p>China's inability to be self-sufficient in paper production is the biggest weakness of the national economy. Although there are more than 30 small-scale paper mills in the country, their total capital is less than 10 million yuan and their annual output is only more than 400,000 pounds. Moreover, the quality is poor and insufficient for modern printing. Therefore, imports of foreign paper reach as high as 50 to 60 million yuan. If paper imports from Canada, Sweden, Norway, Japan, the United States, and other places are cut off, the domestic newspapers, publications, books, and official documents will inevitably come to a standstill. In recent years, the government and the people have deeply understood this crisis and are urgently seeking remedies. On the one hand, tariffs are used as a means to protect and promote the existing domestic paper industry, so that foreign paper prices are raised due to tariffs, and domestic paper can compete. On the other hand, large-scale paper mills are actively being planned as a fundamental solution. The Wenxi Paper Mill, with a capital of 4.5 million yuan, is a government-merchant joint venture company under preparation. Commercial shares of 600,000 yuan are borne by publishing merchants such as the Commercial Press, China, and Shen Bao News. Government shares of 3.9 million yuan are allocated from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity. The preparations for the factory are nearing completion, and machine purchases and factory construction are expected to be completed next year. Although its manufacturing quantity may only be enough for several newspapers in Shanghai, with this foundation, development will be easier.</p>
<p>Now, Japan is using its large capital, skilled and advanced technology and talents, and using the reeds of North China as raw materials, cheap labor, and its superior position in North China to establish paper mills to control the paper industry in North China and then control the entire Chinese paper industry. China's existing immature paper mills and the Wenxi Paper Mill, which is about to be completed, will inevitably suffer a great blow. Currently, Japanese paper, although there are imports of about 8 million yuan per year, is generally restricted by China's customs, with a tax of 2.6 gold units per 100 kilograms. The cost is high, and domestic paper can compete. Now, factories are established in North China, and the products are not subject to tariff restrictions. Domestic paper mills will lose their competitiveness, and the future of Wenxi Paper Mill is also very dim. China's paper industry will inevitably be controlled by Japan. Once an international war unfortunately occurs, the seaports are locked, and the source of paper from Sweden, Canada, the United States, and other places is cut off. Newspapers will have no way to publish, and the printing industry will completely stop. Then the whole country will enter a state of blindness, and the country can use its newspapers and leaflets to shake our people's hearts, frustrate our morale, and promote aggression as it pleases.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not regard Japan's attempt to control the paper industry in North China as trivial. May the government authorities quickly plan the establishment of new-style paper mills and the development of existing paper mills, and quickly catch up to avoid digging a well when thirsty. The slightest bit of paper is actually related to national survival. We should pay attention to national defense work and should not only focus on airplanes and bombs.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The First Committee of the General Assembly of the League of Nations (i.e., the Committee on Legal and Regulatory Matters) previously passed a resolution on the 24th of last month, recommending to the General Assembly that the number of non-permanent Council members of the Administrative Council should be increased from nine to eleven. One of these seats should be given to China, and one seat should be retained by Portugal. The General Assembly of the League of Nations, meeting this morning, has definitely approved this resolution. Therefore, China's request to obtain a quasi-permanent Council seat has achieved its goal. (1st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Assembly of the League of Nations continued its general debate on political issues at 10:00 AM this morning. Hungarian representative Tang Zuo Si delivered a speech, a key point of which was that even if the Third Committee of the General Assembly (i.e., the Committee on Disarmament Issues, which has been temporarily suspended due to the convening of the Disarmament Conference over the years, and the General Assembly this year has a motion to reorganize it) is re-established, Hungary will not be able to cooperate with it. (Tang Zuo Si's words may mean that Hungary intends to break away from the shackles of the Treaty of Trianon and reorganize its armaments.) Subsequently, Colombian representative Rocha No, Portuguese representative Hua Si Gong Sai Luo Si, representative of the Dominican Republic U Lai Na, Argentine representative Le Wei Lie, and Bolivian representative Ge Si Tai Du Ri Er spoke successively, discussing the issue of revising the Covenant of the League of Nations, all saying that the League of Nations should be inclusive of all countries in the world. The General Assembly then announced its adjournment and scheduled to continue the discussion tomorrow morning. (1st, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Toledo General Franco, commander-in-chief of the rebel army, hurried here as soon as he received news of the rebel victory. According to what he said to people, "Relieving the siege of Al-Gazar is my lifelong ambition, and now the battle has indeed been won." When the general arrived here, he was greatly welcomed by the masses. As he drove into the city, everyone knelt on the left side of the road. He then got out of the car in front of the dilapidated castle. The women and children in the castle rushed out to kiss his hand. The scene when the general entered the castle was extremely moving. The castle has become a huge fortress of wood, stone, rough iron. The general cautiously walked forward to avoid touching the unexploded hand grenades scattered everywhere. Then he entered "Toledo's Black Hole," the dungeon in the castle. The dungeon was so dark that it was almost impossible to see things. There were still a hundred wounded lying on dirty curtains. The stench of rotten things was particularly unbearable. The general then went to congratulate the two mothers who had given birth in the siege. So he held a boy and stepped onto the ground, standing in the sunlight. This was the first time the child had seen the light since he was born. The general held the child up to show the crowd and shouted, "This is a symbol of Spain being saved after a fierce bloody battle!" (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Madrid The Spanish government today decided to implement a rationing system to avoid people gathering for long periods of time to get the amount of rice they need. At the same time, it will also take strict action to investigate the civil corps' requisition of civilian goods. These people constantly take by deception and force. For example, last week, they requisitioned 270 boxes of brandy from nine wine merchants, saying that they would be transported to the front line. After investigation by senior and middle-ranking officials, most of them were not transported to the front line. A week ago, eight British aviators were drinking freely in a fashionable wine shop in Madrid. Most of these people were temporarily in financial straits and were moved by high salaries to join the Spanish army and fight bravely for the government. Now none of them are left here. Three have died in battle, three have been seriously injured and are lying in the hospital, one is resting in Valencia, and the remaining one has gone to Paris. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid The organ of the National General Labor Union claimed that today it discovered a secret agreement between Italy, Germany, and the leaders of the Spanish rebels. Once the rebels are victorious, the three parties will share the spoils of war. It is said that the agreement has the following five understandings: (1) Germany will receive the Canary Islands. (2) Germany has the right to establish air and naval bases in the Pescadores Islands. Germany has already established a submarine base there. (3) Italy can get one of the Balearic Islands. (4) Germany will provide economic assistance and various privileges to Portugal and organize an anti-communist association in Portugal. (30th, Guomin dispatch)</p>

<p>(Dalian) The South Manchuria Railway Company plans to build a dry dock capable of accommodating 10,000-ton class ships. The location will be on the opposite shore of Dalian City, separated by a bay. The cost is estimated at 5,000,000 Japanese yen. This area is the most recently developed suburb of Dalian, with major industrial factories such as the Manchuria Chemical Company and the Manchuria Petroleum Company located there. Currently, the only dry dock in Dalian is owned by the Dalian Shipping Company, but it is small in scale and can only repair ships of about 4,000 tons. Years ago, larger ships could be repaired at the Japanese naval dockyard in Lushun, but since the Lushun naval base has been greatly expanded, the dockyard can only accept naval projects and has no time to take care of the repair of commercial ships. It is now rumored that the Dalian Shipping Company's dockyard will be returned to the Japanese Navy. (Reuters dispatch from Dalian, 1st)</p>

<p>(London) The Conservative Party held a conference today in the Maremma region. First, Sir Samuel Hoare, First Lord of the Admiralty, delivered a brilliant speech. The conference then passed a resolution supporting the government's national defense plan. Hoare's speech stated, in brief, that in this era of European rearmament, Britain has no other option but to implement rearmament without delay. The current situation is far worse than it was six months ago, when the government announced that major powers were increasing their armaments significantly. In the past six months, major powers have greatly increased their armaments, and even small countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are undertaking large-scale armament plans. There are two lessons that we should pay attention to: (1) the futility of unilateral disarmament; and (2) the necessity of greatly strengthening the British Empire so that it can become a force to safeguard peace. Germany's annual military expenditure is no less than 800 million pounds. The German budget, the army and navy departments, has reached an alarming 46 percent. Hoare also mentioned the rearmament situation in France, Russia, and the United States, saying that patriotic people should not ignore the armament figures of various countries. Current painful experience proves that the weakness of the British Empire is a factor in international political instability.</p>
<p>Hoare continued to describe the progress of British armaments, saying that the speed of the current naval construction program is quite beyond what was originally expected. The British Air Force has a large number of officers and soldiers with excellent performance, and new aircraft that can be deployed soon will not lag behind any country. Military supplies institutions were clearly exhausted in the years of the European War, and it may take some time to restore them. Britain has not yet reached the point where war arrangements are needed, and the recovery of economic prosperity will not be affected in any way. "From a broad national standpoint, I still believe that the wisest approach is to try to avoid this kind of enormous economic panic." Distorted pacifism and partisan views have had a considerable impact on army recruitment. The government should quickly take steps to inform the people more clearly about the needs of the country and the benefits of military service.</p>
<p>Hoare continued, saying that he would like to ask the responsible leaders of the Labour Party to assist in this effort, as they did during the European War. The government's armament plan is nothing more than the necessary part of Britain's obligations under the collective peace system or the maintenance of the lives and prosperity of a great people. Without the power of a great people, the world will fall into despair and chaos. Building fleets and expanding the air force are absolutely necessary and must be guaranteed. Strengthening the army and strengthening its strength are no less important. Any disarmament proposal that puts British armaments in a relatively weak position cannot be approved. If, as everyone hopes, a general disarmament can be negotiated, then it must be recognized that Britain's plan has been completed. In recent months, national defense has made definite progress, and the speed in the future will increase greatly. In 1936 alone, the program requires the construction of two battleships, seven cruisers, eighteen destroyers, two aircraft carriers, eight submarines, six small warships, and six motor torpedo boats. 80% of naval expenditure has been used in distressed areas, and the struggling shipyards have now resumed their activities. Fellow countrymen who have suffered are now regaining honorable work and fulfilling a part of their responsibility in the great national effort.</p>
<p>Hoare finally mentioned that Defense Minister Sir Thomas Inskip, Air Minister Viscount Swinton, and War Minister Cooper were attending meetings of the Imperial Defence Committee, so they were unable to attend today. (Reuters dispatch from London, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e60">England-South Africa Air Race: Scott Wins Again, Flying 6,000 Miles in 53 Hours <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Johannesburg Scott, the winner of the previous England-Australia Air Race, and Gutsly have won the Portsmouth to Johannesburg air race. Flying the same aircraft, they arrived at Germiston Aerodrome at 12:36 PM today, winning the prize of 4,000 pounds. This time, they flew 6,154 miles in 52 hours, 56 minutes, and 48.2 seconds, with an average speed of 123 miles per hour, reducing Mrs. Mollison's London to Cape air record by approximately 19 hours. If they decide to fly on, they can set a new record, but they have decided to stop here. A crowd initially gathered at the aerodrome and stayed up all night to welcome the winners, but due to the strong winds and sand in the morning, they returned home. Therefore, only 2,000 people remained when the winning aircraft arrived. The aircraft landed very smoothly. South African Defense Minister Bi Luo, the initiator of this competition, and South African industrialist Schlesinger, and Sir Melville, the first person to fly from England to South Africa, stepped forward to congratulate them. The obstacle competition winner has not yet been decided. At the time of the dispatch, Findlay and Waller's aircraft had left Khartoum at midnight and were between Anetebai and Bai Logan Mountain. Air Force officer Clauston is still in Khartoum repairing his aircraft's engine. It is reported that Loewin and Houston's aircraft were damaged near Lake Tanganyika, following Hails' aircraft. It is said that the two were looking for the Abercorn Aerodrome in Northern Rhodesia in the sky, but the fire on the grass field produced thick smoke, obscuring their vision. Due to running out of fuel, they landed and the aircraft was destroyed. However, when Scott and Gutsly's aircraft arrived in Abercorn, the smoke had cleared and they were able to land safely.

If Rue-Xiu II's aircraft had not been blinded by smoke, the outcome would have been difficult to determine. Now that this aircraft has been destroyed, Scott has the trophy in hand. Both showed no signs of fatigue after exiting the aircraft. An official carried Scott's luggage, and Scott followed him to the aerodrome office. Someone poured him a glass of beer, and just as Scott was about to drink it, a phone call came from London congratulating him on his success. Scott then talked for many minutes before enjoying the fragrant food and drink placed beside him. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Palestine: Anti-British Movement, Plot to Bomb British Army with Landmines Foiled <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Jerusalem Today, a carefully planned plot to bomb a British troop convoy with landmines was discovered in time. The Royal Rifle Regiment troops, carried by the British transport ship "Neularia," disembarked at Haifa and then took several trucks to this location. Their arrival was earlier than expected, so the conspirators' wishes were not fulfilled. The convoy came to a number of semi-excavated pits in the road near Ginning, preventing the vehicles from advancing. They got out of the vehicles and filled them in before they could safely reach their destination. According to a statement issued by the British authorities, since the outbreak of unrest in Palestine, a total of two British officers and eighteen soldiers have been killed, sixteen officers and eighty-seven soldiers have been wounded, and ten others have been injured in accidents.

<p>(Berlin) A senior government official said today that he supports the convening of an international monetary conference, adding that if the international commodity exchange system is restored, Hitler's four-year plan will be immediately abandoned. The spokesman also said that Germany must have colonies to produce raw materials. Germany believes that there is a tacit understanding of the gold standard, but unfortunately it has been broken by the United Kingdom and the United States. Now France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are following suit. If major countries convene a meeting to discuss monetary stability, remove exchange and trade controls, develop a large-scale international bill exchange, and restore free credit understanding, Germany is also prepared to participate. If Germany's external debt can be reduced or abolished, Germany is also willing to abandon its monetary control. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) When the Central Bank held a board meeting yesterday, President and Economics Minister Hjalmar Schacht said that Germany is prepared to participate once international monetary negotiations are held. Newspapers have commented on Schacht's remarks, saying that if Germany participates in monetary negotiations, it will definitely put forward several conditions. According to the Berliner Tageblatt, one condition is that Germany's debt should be liquidated in a reasonable manner, and the other is that the colonial issue should be resolved. The Börsen-Zeitung argued that the issue of raw material redistribution should be resolved in a fair manner, and that the current negotiations should be limited to the purely economic scope.

<h3 id="e63">French New Monetary Law: Conflict Between Senate and Chamber of Deputies, Compromise Finally Reached, Article on Raising Prices Passes with a Compromise <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies conflicted over the new monetary law today because the Chamber of Deputies rejected the amendment passed by the Senate by a majority of 351 to 217 and passed the original bill again. The dispute intensified. The Chamber of Deputies has submitted the original bill to the Senate for reconsideration. The point of contention is that after the Senate passed the franc devaluation bill, it deleted the clause granting Prime Minister Blum full power to prohibit raising prices. The Chamber of Deputies insisted on the original bill. The reason why the Senate was dissatisfied with the bill was that it contained socialist elements and feared that it would grant the government dictatorial powers. (National Telegram dispatch from Paris, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the new monetary law proposed by the government, the Chamber of Deputies re-voted and passed the original bill last night, and rejected the amendment proposed by the Senate. The Senate Finance Committee re-examined it this morning, and formulated a compromise plan. The Senate then passed it by a show of hands at 1:30 PM today. According to the compromise plan, if the standard of living increases due to currency devaluation, causing social disputes, the government can use compulsory arbitration to resolve it, but only after consulting the National Economic Council in advance. The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet again at 2:30 PM to submit the compromise plan for a vote. In addition, although the method of compensating veteran pensions was specified in Article 16 of the original bill, the Senate rejected it at its meeting yesterday, believing that this compensation method should not be included in the monetary law. If a separate bill is proposed, it can be approved. Therefore, the government has already drafted another bill and submitted it to the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. It is expected that the committee can pass it, so that the Chamber of Deputies can submit it for a vote at its afternoon meeting and send it to the Senate for review. People in the Deputies' lounge recently said that after several back-and-forth discussions between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, the new monetary law can be finally passed. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies convened at 2:30 PM and passed the compromise plan proposed by the Senate regarding the new monetary law.

<h3 id="e64">Senate Amendment <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Senate discussed the monetary law all day. After intense debate, it finally held a vote at 9:40 PM tonight, passing the entire bill by a majority of 141 votes to 125. However, the section in the original bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies, which "grants the government full power to prevent price increases," was deleted, and replaced with another section stipulating that "the government only has the right to prohibit price increases when there is no legitimate reason." Before voting on the entire bill, it was submitted for a vote article by article. When Article 1 of the original bill, which stipulated "repealing the monetary law of June 25, 1928," was submitted for a vote, it was only passed by a majority of 137 votes to 127. In other words, the government only had a majority of ten votes. During the Senate debate this afternoon, senators from the centrist and right-wing factions spoke out one after another, attacking the government, saying that since the People's Front government came to power, its authority has been lost, and it has even condoned workers who occupy factories because their demands for wage increases have not been met. As a result, the devaluation of the franc is the inevitable result of the government's mismanagement. Finance Minister Olivier refuted them separately, saying that "currency devaluation is the result of the general international economic situation. For six years, countries around the world have been devaluing their currencies due to the recession. Only France, under previous governments, has always adhered to the policy of currency tightening and did not know how to adapt. Until other countries successively broke away from the bondage of the currency system and gradually recovered prosperity, only France was trapped in a golden cage and could not escape. Why is this so? France's gold reserves at the beginning of 1935 were still 90 billion francs, but later suddenly decreased to 54 billion francs, and it is impossible to allow it to continue to flow out. As for thinking that prices will inevitably skyrocket after the devaluation of the franc, this is also an overestimation, because currency devaluation and inflation are different. Inflation will inevitably raise prices, while currency devaluation will not affect domestic trade."</p>
<p>Former Finance Minister Caillaux then spoke, "In principle, I do not oppose the devaluation of the franc, but the losses from devaluation should be borne jointly by people of all classes. It is absolutely impossible to allow one class of people to exclusively benefit from the devaluation, while the middle class and those who live on interest bear the entire loss of the franc devaluation... Furthermore, it is a mistake to think that increasing purchasing power can solve the economic panic, because France is an agricultural country, and the suffering it is now experiencing is due to overproduction in industry, not due to insufficient purchasing power." Finally, Prime Minister Léon Blum delivered a speech to answer the opposition party's various criticisms of the government's social policies, saying, "I firmly believe that my task is to seek universal harmony and appeasement. I am confident that I will achieve this goal, but it cannot be achieved by means of mutual retaliation, because the result of mutual retaliation will inevitably lead to a real social war. When Congress adjourned in August of this year, the national strike wave had almost disappeared, but it rose again in September, but now it has returned to calm. As for whether the government's monetary policy can be successful, it depends entirely on whether employers and employees can trust each other. Even if there are occasional labor disputes, they should not be deliberately exaggerated to create hostile propaganda. We must continue to fulfill our responsibilities in the future and use persuasion and mediation to quell all labor unrest." Finally, Prime Minister Léon Blum declared that the Senate had amended the section in the original bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies regarding the prohibition of price increases, and the government could not assume responsibility for it, because "a moment ago I asked you to find a way to allow the government to avoid future social conflicts, but now you insist on causing a conflict between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, which is not what I want."</p>
<p>However, the Senate finally passed the monetary law in accordance with the Finance Committee's amendment, and deleted the section authorizing the government to prohibit price increases. The Senate is scheduled to meet again at 9:30 AM tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Chamber of Deputies Insists <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After the new monetary law was amended and passed by the Senate, it should be returned to the Chamber of Deputies for reconsideration according to law. The Chamber of Deputies convened at 11:26 PM last night. Chairman and Speaker Herriot, as well as Finance Committee rapporteur Schmid and representatives of various left-wing parties, presented reports, advocating that the original Article 14 of the bill, which the Senate had deleted, that is, "granting the government full power to prevent price increases," be changed to Article 13B, "the government only has the right to prohibit price increases when there is no legitimate reason," and should be rejected. The deputies then began to debate. Several right-wing deputies fiercely attacked the devaluation of the franc and criticized the government's bill for not proposing compensation measures for farmers. Finance Minister Olivier stood up and replied that, according to the agreement reached between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the French stock exchanges should reopen tomorrow, and asked the Chamber of Deputies to vote quickly. When the vote was held at 1:35 AM this morning, the original bill of the Chamber of Deputies was passed again, and the clauses deleted by the Senate were rejected. In addition, Article 25 "B" was passed and listed at the end of the original bill, with the following text: "Those who have engaged in spot or futures trading on domestic securities exchanges or commodity exchanges before the currency devaluation order on the 26th of last month and have made a profit shall be levied a special tax of 50% on the amount of profit earned at the time of this month's settlement. This special tax shall be deducted by the brokers from their customers and submitted to the government." The entire bill has now been returned to the Senate for reconsideration, and the Senate is scheduled to meet at 9:30 AM today to discuss it. According to predictions from political circles, if the Senate does not change its attitude at that time, the government is in danger of collapsing when it finally proposes a vote of confidence, which will inevitably cause extremely serious disputes in politics and society.

<h3 id="e67">Rural Relief in Luxi: Organizing Financial Circulation Offices to Handle Loans, Remittances, Deposits, and Warehousing <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: In recent years, rural bankruptcy and economic panic have affected the market, financial activity is stagnant, and industry and commerce are gradually becoming depressed. The Luxi area suffered a particularly severe flood last year, making the rural situation even more difficult. The Second Administrative Inspectorate of Heze, in view of this, and in order to seek relief, recently established financial circulation offices in its subordinate counties to handle loans, remittances, deposits, loans, and warehousing, etc., to regulate rural finance. A joint office of financial circulation offices was also established in the second administrative region of Heze to comprehensively manage all matters in the counties. Lai Zhizhong, director of the joint office, came to Jinan a few days ago to contact major banks for loans and remittances. He completed his affairs this morning (27th) and returned to Heze by car. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>According to Lai, the method of relieving the rural areas is that this district is responsible for the establishment of financial circulation offices in each county to relieve rural bankruptcy. A joint office of financial circulation offices was also established in Heze. The six counties of Heze, Dingtao, Chengwu, Shanxian, Yuncheng, and Jinxiang have been established and officially opened on September 10. Each uses the surplus of local funds from previous years as a fund. The surplus of each county is 20,000 to 30,000 yuan for the smaller ones, and 70,000 to 80,000 yuan for the larger ones, with a total of more than 200,000 yuan already raised as a fund. As for the scope of business, it is roughly divided into (1) loans. The main business of the office is rural loans, most of which are lent to cooperatives to be distributed to farmers at low interest. The second is short-term mortgage loans, which are lent to commercial firms. (2) Deposits, to collect idle funds from the community, and store them for long and short terms. An account can be opened with one yuan. Because most counties do not have banks, depositors are very enthusiastic. (3) Remittances. In addition to counties with circulation offices responsible for mutual remittances, they have also contacted a major bank in Jinan to be responsible for handling remittances to various counties in Luxi inside and outside the province. The stipulated remittance rate is extremely low. This contract can be established soon. (4) Exchange. Since the implementation of the legal currency, silver has no longer circulated in the market. Merchants are very picky about banknotes, and damaged ones are rejected. Farmers feel quite painful, so the office exchanges small amounts for them, and then brings them to Jinan to exchange for new banknotes. (5) In addition to local small loans provided by the financial circulation office, if there are large loans, the office will contact major banks to provide them. (6) Warehousing. The Heze Mutual Aid Society obtained a triple profit from running a bean warehouse in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. This year's soybeans, except for a small part affected by insect pests, have generally had a bumper harvest. The credit cooperatives are responsible for this business. The county government ordered the township agricultural schools in each county to prepare 30 to 50 warehouses, which are now ready. The number of self-produced soybeans that members are willing to store has been registered, and the registered number has reached 10 million catties. The county government should provide a part of the cash, which requires 300,000 yuan, and has now reached an agreement with a major bank in Jinan, and the contract will be signed soon. This warehousing method can be started after it is approved by the provincial government.</p>

Nearby people who heard the news all wanted to request to join. However, the articles of association stipulate that its business scope is only the two townships of Taicang Liuxin and Chenxing, Jiading Humin Township, and Baoshan Shuangcao Township. In order to develop the society's affairs and share the benefits equally, the society specifically decided at the end of last month that anyone who cultivates Changyinsha cotton outside the scope of the society can join as a preparatory member. All rights and obligations are exactly the same as those of formal members.</p>

<p>Stage Collapse Injures People</p>
<p>Zhang Zhonghou, the owner of Dacheng Silk Factory in Longchuanhong outside the west gate of this town, hired the Zhejiang Central Grand Stage Opera Troupe organized by Hu Chenglin to perform operas to thank the gods in the open space next to the factory during the Mid-Autumn Festival because the factory's grand immortals were causing trouble. The gong was struck at 2 pm, and at about 3 pm, when the stage was performing the scene of Cheng Jingsi and Jie Bao from Pearl Curtain Peak, Li Keyong refused to send troops, the stage suddenly shook, and with a crash, the front and back stages all collapsed. The audience scrambled to escape, and the order was disrupted. At that time, Jiangbei children Ren Genbao (14 years old), Koubao (10 years old), and Koudi (4 years old) were crushed, as well as Hu Xu, who set up a lotus root stall, and onlookers Zhang Xinru and Zhu Pangeng, etc., were all bleeding from their heads, and the situation was very tragic. Among them, Ren Genbao was the most seriously injured because he was injured in the chest, and his life may be in danger. All were sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. The Central Stage also suffered considerable losses, with all the boxes, cages, and clothes crushed. All the actors fell off the stage and suffered minor injuries.

<p>Water Thieves Confess to Robbery</p>
<p>At 6 pm on the 29th of last month, the Public Security First Sub-Bureau outside the west gate of Wuyi, together with the patrol team outside the west circle gate, successively captured seven stolen boats and eight thieves, including Sha Shoushan, and several pieces of stolen goods such as rice, wheat, clothing, and bedding in the river. They confessed to stealing from warehouses and other places in the city. On the 30th, patrol officer Zhou Daonan rigorously interrogated them again. The criminals then confessed that on the evening of the 14th of last month, they robbed the house of Sheng Linhai at Magong Bridge in Ximen, and divided the stolen goods for use. They also confessed that there was a fake pistol that was thrown into the river before being arrested. Patrol Officer Zhou sent police to retrieve the fake pistol but failed. He immediately summoned the colleague, who confirmed that it was the original stolen item. Because the thieves were actually a large group of water bandits, it was assumed that they had robbed other places, so they were still being rigorously interrogated and will be sent to the court for trial within a few days.</p>

The car also overturned into the field and crashed into the tomb opposite. The entire body of the car was destroyed. All the passengers except one were unharmed, and the rest were seriously injured. Afterwards, the Shaoxing Station sent a car to send the injured Gao Yantong, Qian Zhongde, Pan Jiongxuan, Qiu Axin, Fan Shuchang, Chen Wen'e, Xu Qian, Zhao Shengcai, and the Chen couple to the Nanjie Fukang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Several Famous International Cases of Protecting Overseas Chinese <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shengwu</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>On August 24th of this year, a mob riot occurred in Chengdu, destroying hostels and shops. At the time, there were casualties among soldiers, police, and civilians, and four Japanese residents in Sichuan were also beaten, two of whom, Watanabe Kōzaburō and Fukagawa Keiji, died of serious injuries. Takeo Tanaka and Hisashi Seto were rescued. After the case occurred, the local authorities immediately arrested two rioters and executed them on the spot. Japan sent warships to Chongqing, but the official negotiations between the two countries on this incident had not yet begun as of the time of writing. Unexpectedly, one wave has not yet subsided, and another wave has risen. Suddenly, newspapers on September 8th reported that Nakano Junzō, a local Japanese resident in Beihai, Guangxi, was killed during a demonstration (some say he died in a fight with a Chinese person). The details of this case are still unknown, and the official investigation report on the Chengdu incident has not been published. Under these circumstances, rashly commenting may inevitably lead to inaccuracies; not criticizing and merely placing various expectations on Japan's resolution of this case will not help the actual situation. Therefore, I will briefly describe several famous international cases of protecting overseas Chinese, in order to clarify the different ways in which such cases are resolved internationally. Secondly, I will also briefly discuss the responsibilities that a country should bear for harm to foreign residents.</p>
<p>The term "protecting overseas Chinese" has a broad scope. When a country's people reside in other countries, from being humiliated to having their lives and property harmed, and do not receive adequate protection from the government of the host country, or do not receive adequate remedy from the government of the host country after the incident, and are deemed to be contrary to fairness and justice, the government of the victimized overseas Chinese's home country has the right to rise up and protect them through diplomatic means. The records of international cases of protecting overseas Chinese are extremely numerous, and the circumstances of their occurrence are also extremely complex. This article only focuses on riot events, selects the key points for description, and also discusses in principle the events of harm to foreign residents that occur in countries during times of turmoil.</p>
<p>II. The New Orleans Mob Riot of 1891</p>
<p>On March 14, 1891, eleven Italian residents in New Orleans, USA, were brutally killed by a local mob on suspicion of assassinating Police Chief Hennessey (D.C. Heunesy). When the Italian residents were arrested, they were all arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of murder. Among them, five had not yet been tried, three had already been released, and the other three were awaiting second trial. As for the reason why Police Chief Hennessey was killed, it was because he tried to destroy a secret organization (called Mafia) and aroused hatred. After the eleven Italians were killed, the Italian consul in New Orleans immediately reported to the Italian Minister to the United States, who also received instructions from his country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day, requesting the US government to take swift and effective measures to protect the Italian people residing in New Orleans and to punish the rioters according to law. The Italian Minister, in accordance with these instructions, immediately prepared a document notifying the US government, while reserving the Italian government's right to claim compensation. On the same day, the US State Department telegraphed the governor of the location where the incident occurred (Governor Nicholls), placing the rioters under legal control and strictly preventing the occurrence of similar incidents. It also explained that the US-Italian treaty stipulated that the United States had the obligation to protect the lives and property of Italian residents, and the US President expressed deep regret for the occurrence of the New Orleans riot.</p>
<p>The US State Department sent a copy of the telegram to the Governor to the Italian Minister. However, the Italian government insisted on demanding compensation, and if this could not be done, it would withdraw its Minister to the United States. On March 31, 1891, the Italian Minister made the following two requests to the United States: (1) The federal government formally promised to punish the rioters. (2) In principle, recognize the right to compensation for the families of the victims. At the same time, it notified the US government that it would leave the US and return home immediately. After the Italian Minister returned home, the affairs of the Italian Embassy were taken over by the Chargé d'Affaires. On April 1, 1891, the US State Department's document to the Italian Chargé d'Affaires mentioned the above two requests, stating that the US government had recognized in principle the compensation for the victimized Italians, because their treaty rights in the US were infringed. However, the unfortunate incident that occurred on March 14th must be thoroughly investigated and should not be rushed excessively. Before formally agreeing to any request, the facts obtained from the investigation must be judged in detail according to law. This has been repeatedly explained to the Italian Minister who returned home. The Italian side's impatience may be understandable, but excessive impatience will not necessarily lead to a just resolution.</p>
<p>The Italian government misinterpreted the above document from the US government, believing that the US government formally recognized its responsibility for compensation. US Secretary of State Mr. Blaine then issued a note to the Italian Chargé d'Affaires on April 14, 1891, correcting his erroneous interpretation, and stating that the US President still had many facts to determine whether Italy's treaty rights had been infringed. After analyzing and discussing the various facts according to law, Blaine had the following sentence at the end of the document:</p>
<p>The Italian people who were victimized in the New Orleans riot were either temporary or long-term residents in the area. If their lives and actions were not contrary to the provisions of the US-Italian treaty, did not violate our country's immigration laws, did not hinder the public order of the United States, and complied with the laws of the United States and the places where the Italian residents lived, and if the government officials did not fulfill their responsibility to protect the lives and property of foreign residents, or condoned the occurrence of riots, or were aware of the crisis of riots and did not take appropriate deterrent measures, or did not bring the rioters to justice after the riots occurred. Under these circumstances, the US President will of course recognize that the case has been established and will submit it to Congress for consideration and provide relief to the relatives of the victims who were brutally killed.</p>
<p>On May 5, 1891, the Chief Justice of New Orleans prepared a report on the riot and pardoned the participants in the riot who attacked the prison. No charges were filed, and no trials were held.</p>
<p>On December 6 of the year following the riot, US President Harison made the following statement in his document to Congress:</p>
<p>The US government, in order to express friendship to the Italian government, deeply condemned the occurrence of the New Orleans incident and provided 125,000 francs as compensation. The King of Italy expressed his gratitude upon accepting it. The resolution of this case has greatly enhanced the friendly and mutually respectful sentiments between the US and Italy.</p>
<p>When US Secretary of State Blaine handed over the compensation of 125,000 francs to the Italian Chargé d'Affaires on April 12, 1892, he reiterated in the note that the damage suffered by the Italian people was not directly inflicted by the United States. In other words, the US government had no legal responsibility for this incident; however, the US President believed that paying satisfactory compensation was the sacred obligation and supreme pleasure of the US government. Blaine further stated that the US President hoped that the resolution of this case would be sufficient to dispel the negative impression caused by the case, restore the former friendly relations between the US and Italy, and prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents that could harm the harmony and sincerity between the two countries in the future. The Italian Chargé d'Affaires immediately accepted the compensation and replied to Blaine's words on behalf of the Italian government, while declaring in accordance with the instructions of the Italian government that the relations between the two countries were immediately restored from then on.</p>
<p>Looking at the resolution process of the New Orleans riot, two points are worth noting: (1) Italy's request to punish the murderers was not accepted by the US government. (2) The US government's compensation of 125,000 francs was an expression of friendship, not the fulfillment of legal responsibility. The 1885 massacre of overseas Chinese in Rock Springs, USA, is also worth mentioning. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Income Tax Collection Begins Yesterday; Interest Income Tax on Deposits Postponed; Liang Jingchun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Preside <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Ministry of Finance is implementing income tax, initially collecting three types: second-class income from salaries and remuneration of civil servants, and third-class income from securities and interest on deposits. The announcement was made yesterday, but due to the delayed distribution of forms for the third-class interest on deposits, nationwide implementation could not occur simultaneously. The Ministry of Finance is considering alternative solutions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Proclamation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a public announcement yesterday stating: It has been determined by the National Government that the income tax on salaries and remuneration of civil servants, as well as interest on government bonds and deposits, will be levied starting October 1, 25th year of the Republic. The important matters are announced as follows: 1. Tax Rates: Income from salaries and remuneration of civil servants will be taxed according to Article 5 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, calculated separately. Income from government bonds and interest on deposits will be taxed according to Article 6 of the same regulations. 2. Withholding: Income tax on salaries and remuneration of civil servants will be withheld monthly by the heads of the agencies directly paying the salaries. Income tax on government bonds and interest on deposits will be withheld by the responsible personnel of the paying institutions when reporting interest settlements. 3. Payment: Withholding agencies shall remit the withheld tax to the Central Bank or its designated agents, such as the Bank of Communications, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, or other tax collecting agencies, and obtain receipts. Separate orders will be issued for implementation. This announcement is issued by Minister Kong Xiangxi, September, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Response</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, earnestly requesting a delay in the collection of income tax on third-class deposit interest income. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance responded, acknowledging the veracity of the request and demonstrating consideration by postponing implementation until January 1, 26th year of the Republic. However, the income tax on interest from government bonds will still be collected starting October 1. The original response is recorded below: The submission has been noted. The implementation date for the income tax on deposit interest has been announced. The collection methods are detailed in the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Rules. As for the flight of capital, since the announcement of the Income Tax Regulations, people from all walks of life have considered it a good tax system, demonstrating patriotism. Furthermore, the tax rates are very low. It is unlikely that people would violate their patriotic intentions to avoid paying taxes. In recent years, various countries around the world have either devalued their currencies or increased the amount of currency in circulation. Currency values ​​change from morning to evening, making it difficult to determine the definite standard for property prices. Only a foolish person would deposit their assets in foreign banks while residing in China, as they would not be able to understand the operating conditions and profit and loss situation. People should be able to recall the pain suffered by the Chinese in the past. Why would anyone risk danger and cause themselves trouble to avoid paying a small amount of tax? Even if there are a few who are unwilling to pay taxes and try to evade funds, the government will enforce the law without leniency. The original submission is excessive. However, the claim that this is a new undertaking, with complicated procedures and a tight schedule, making preparations extremely difficult, is true. Therefore, in order to show special consideration, the implementation date for the income tax on this item of deposit interest is temporarily postponed to January 1, 26th year of the Republic. However, the income tax on interest from government bonds should still be collected from October 1 as originally scheduled. In addition to the ministry submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for review and record, you should forward this to all fellow traders, and instruct each branch to follow and implement this together. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<p>Liang's Remarks</p>
<p>The Income Tax Affairs Office was established in Nanjing yesterday, with Gao Bingfang and Liang Jingchun, the Director and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office, respectively, in charge. Its structure is very simple. According to Deputy Director Liang, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, the implementation of income tax has been supported by the whole country, and it is fortunate that it can be held as scheduled. The second and third classes have already been distributed by the Ministry of Finance to various agencies, and letters have been sent to various banks and money houses to withhold the tax. The procedures are simple, so the organizational structure of the Affairs Office does not need to be expanded. Staff will be dispatched to various provinces and cities to provide instructions. The establishment of branch offices in various locations is currently under consideration. In remote provinces and cities, locations in the commercial and industrial centers may be considered for establishment. As for the forms and receipts used for taxation, they have been sent out separately. Because the banking industry in this city received the forms and was unable to distribute them to various branches before the start of collection, Kong the Minister of Finance has considered the fact that institutions such as the Postal Remittance Bureau and Bank of Communications have dozens of branches and hundreds of sub-branches, and has decided to set another date for collection in order to ensure the consistency of taxation. The Ministry of Finance is determined to implement this decision in order to cultivate a good source of tax revenue and does not want to be hasty. The banking industry takes this seriously and studies it in detail. The government expresses its admiration and hopes to have a good contribution to make the procedures even more perfect, he said.</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: The Shanghai Banking and Money Trades Association received a directive from the Ministry of Finance the night before last, stating, "The Provisional Income Tax Regulations have been ordered by the National Government to be implemented from October 1, 25th year of the Republic, and it has been stipulated that the income from salaries and remuneration of second-class civil servants and the income from government bonds and interest on third-class deposits will be levied starting from October 1, 25th year of the Republic. All other incomes of the first, second, and third classes will be levied starting from January 1, 26th year of the Republic. Obey and follow the order. The records are on file. According to Article 18 of the regulations, those who are required to withhold income tax for third-class income should report the income amount in the prescribed format to the competent collection agency one month after paying the interest. Furthermore, the method of paying income tax stipulated in Article 27 of the Implementing Rules, which belongs to the third class, shall be withheld by the business person in charge of the interest-paying agency. The collection of income from the salaries and remuneration of second-class civil servants and the income from government bonds and interest on third-class deposits is imminent, and should be communicated to all and followed. In addition to the income tax on salaries and remuneration of second-class civil servants and the income tax on interest on third-class government bonds, which have been distributed separately by the Ministry for implementation, all income tax on deposit interest should be deducted in full by banks, money houses, silver companies, trust companies, savings societies, and money shops in various places, according to regulations, and those with taxes less than one cent should be rounded up or down. The collected taxes should be handed over to the local Central Bank or its designated tax collecting agencies, and remitted to the national treasury for collection. Furthermore, this income tax will be levied from October 1, 25th year of the Republic, and the interest income before October 1 will still be paid in full and exempted from deduction. The 'Collection Instructions for Income Tax on Third-Class Securities Deposit Interest' and the 'Report Form for Income Tax Amount of Third-Class Category D' are hereby attached, one hundred copies each, for compliance and for forwarding to all members of the same industry for compliance. As for those who are not members of the association, and those who receive deposits without using the names of banks or shops, in addition to the instruction from the relevant provincial and municipal finance bureaus to follow and implement the case, you should also be informed.</p>
<p>Notices from Both Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Trades Association, upon receiving instructions from the Ministry of Finance, has ordered its affiliated banks, silver firms, silver companies, money shops, savings societies, and trust companies to deduct income tax on securities deposit interest from October 1 in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations, and to attach Income Tax Instructions and Category D Income Tax Forms. After receiving the order, the two associations immediately mimeographed the original text of the Ministry of Finance and attached the instructions and forms for distribution to all member banks and money shops for compliance. The notice states: "Respectfully, we have received Order No. 29635 from the Ministry of Finance, stating 'The Center Road' etc., and have also issued one hundred copies each of the Collection Instructions and Category D Income Amount Report Forms. With this, we are forwarding them to you accordingly, and attaching two copies each of the Collection Instructions and Report Forms for your inspection and collection. We hope that you will print them yourself according to the format for future use." As for the Shanghai Municipal Government, it has already been ordered to collect income tax on salaries and remuneration of civil servants in accordance with the regulations from yesterday, but at the same time, it has canceled the income donation.</p>
<p>Studying Procedures</p>
<p>The Banking Association has submitted the opinions on income tax collection procedures proposed by the Banking Academy to various member banks for study and solicitation of opinions. Now, various banks have sent their opinions to the association one after another. The association will then compile them and submit them to the Executive Committee for approval before submitting them to the Ministry of Finance for suggestions, hoping to be adopted. The Money Trades Association is scheduled to hold a meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM today to elect members of the Income Tax Research Committee, and then hold a committee meeting to study various collection procedures. At the same time, the opinions of the Banking Academy will also be studied, and Secretary-General Qin Xieqing will be appointed to consult with Secretary-General Lin Kanghou of the Banking Association on everything as necessary, because both the Banking and Money Trades are financial institutions with the same nature.</p>

Therefore, the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai are extremely happy that Yu Qiao is old, and it is also the 55th anniversary of his stay in Shanghai. Since he arrived in Shanghai at the age of sixteen, he has worked hard in both his career and public welfare. We must know that there is a position if there is a career, and there is honor if there is public welfare. At first, we don’t have to rely on anything, but if we can work hard and advocate fairness, we will be able to achieve remarkable results and reach the day of success.

As for the history of Mr. Qiao's life, there is no need for me to introduce it. Mr. Zhi has such success because of his far-sighted vision and hard work. In order to express our gratitude to Director Yu Hua, the board of directors renamed Xizang Road to Yu Qiaqing Road to show our respect and admiration."</p>
<p>Successive Speeches, then Chinese Superintendent Xu Xinliu gave a speech, roughly saying that Mr. Yu Qiaqing is 70 years old this year, and all sectors of society have initiated a request to the Labour Bureau to rename Xizang Road to Yu Qiaqing Road. Since Mr. Yu has been a Chinese Superintendent, he has spared no effort in all facilities that are beneficial to society. In order to admire the virtuous and capable, the Board of Directors passed the resolution and implemented it today. Mr. Yu has made countless contributions to society. For example, after the May 30th incident, the recovery of the court and the increase of the Dongwei. Today, we commemorate Mr. Yu. In addition to hoping that Mr. Yu will continue to work hard in the future to seek welfare for our Chinese people, we should also emulate the spirit of Mr. Next, Huang Renzhi · Fu Xiaoan · gave speeches successively (the length of the words is omitted).</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Reply, Mr. Yu Qiaqing replied (translated by Guo Dehua), "General Superintendent, General Manager, President, Consul, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades, I am deeply grateful today for the love of all sectors of society and the request to the Labour Bureau to rename Xizang Road. I feel ashamed for having made no contributions to society and the people in the past. Now I am so honored, and I am even more ashamed. In the future, I will follow in the footsteps of all of you and do my best to seek the welfare of the Chinese people in the concession."</p>

<h3 id="e81">Yesterday the Situation in Hongkou and Zhabei Suddenly Tightened; Japanese Troops Extended Their Posts to the Suzhou Creek; Patrol Posts Along the Border Were Withdrawn Late at Night; Barbed Wire Was Erected at Key Intersections on North Sichuan Road; Two Theories Circulate as to Why the Situation Suddenly Tightened <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: Since the sniping incident involving Japanese marines in Hongkou on the evening of the 23rd, Japanese Marines, ostensibly to protect overseas Chinese, have been deploying defenses in Hongkou and crossing into Zhabei. The situation had been easing for the past few days. However, yesterday morning, Japanese troops again showed activity, and the situation suddenly seemed to tighten considerably. By late evening, the situation in Hongkou remained the same, while the Zhabei area returned to calm. The actual situation as investigated by a Xinsheng News Agency reporter is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Deploy Defenses Reaching the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>It was found that in the past few days, Japanese troops had only deployed defenses in the concession north of Old Joffre Road. Yesterday, starting from 5:00 AM, the Japanese troops expanded their range, reaching the Suzhou Road and the banks of the Suzhou Creek. They placed sentries along North Sichuan Road and Chapoo Road. Furthermore, they erected barbed wire at the roadsides of key intersections on North Sichuan Road near Old Joffre Road, Haining Road, Peng Road, Wuchang Road, and Tiantong Road, near the Postal Administration, which could block traffic at any time. A light machine gun was also set up at the intersection of Old Joffre Road.</p>
<p>Road Patrols More Frequent Than Before</p>
<p>Japanese troops, centered around the Xingjiaqiao Wan Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road, as well as the No. 504 foreign-style house at the intersection of Dixwell Road and Zhimei Road, set up two separate defense posts. Armored vehicles, military trucks, motorcycles, and scattered or organized squads were dispatched to patrol the roads. These patrols, which were originally limited to north of Old Joffre Road, also headed south yesterday, reaching the Suzhou Creek, and the traffic was more frequent than before. At the same time, Japanese troop posts and patrols on Dixwell Road also expanded from the intersection of Tianzheng Road to the Jiaxing Road Bridge yesterday, connecting with the Japanese troops on Wusong Road. Dozens more Japanese troops were stationed at the Japanese Club on Peng Road. Furthermore, nearly every area of the Hongkou region on Haining Road and other roads had Japanese troop posts and patrols. The above is the situation in the concession yesterday before noon. When the reporter went to inspect again around 9:00 PM, the troops stationed at the Japanese Club were gone, with only one post remaining. Other situations such as patrols and barbed wire remained unchanged.</p>
<p>More Posts Set Up in the Zhabei Area</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, Japanese troops centered their defense posts on the Tanwu Distillery at the end of Huayuan Street and the Japanese Girls' School at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Sida Road. Japanese troops had sentries on the streets of the city on the night of the Hongkou Japanese marine case. The sentries were withdrawn the following night. For the past six days no sentries were sent. Yesterday, starting at 7:00 AM, Japanese troop posts suddenly appeared along Tongbao Road near the intersection of Tongji Road, west to the Yokohama River near the Japanese cemetery, north to the railway crossing on Guangzhong Road, and east to the intersection of Ouyang Road and Shigaoda Road, along Tongji Road, Hengye Road, Jiangwan Road, Xiangde Road, Ouyang Road, Sida Road, and Baoxing Road. On Zhimei Road, Japanese troop posts were sent to Qiaodi No. 1, and all roads were heavily guarded, with almost every hundred or two hundred paces being a double post. All were carrying long guns. At the same time, Japanese troop patrol teams on the above roads were also more frequent than before. However, there were no armored vehicles or barbed wire erected along Tongji Road and Jiangwan Road.</p>
<p>Situation in the City is Peaceful at Night</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter's continued investigation last night, the reestablishment of Japanese troop posts in Zhabei was only temporary. It was only from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM, and 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The purpose was to protect Japanese students. There were many Japanese residences near Jiangwan Road. These three time slots were when Japanese elementary school students were going to school, attending classes, and returning home. Therefore, the situation returned to peace at night. However, troops were stationed all day at the connecting concession and cross-border roads of Ouyang Road, Sida Road, and Zhimei Road, and were not withdrawn until late at night. Yesterday, trucks continued to carry Japanese troops to the Tanwu Distillery, but others were also seen leaving from there. Japanese troops were not seen in the nearby open spaces, probably because they were hidden indoors. Only five people remained guarding the Japanese cemetery.</p>
<p>Two Theories About the Cause of the Tension</p>
<p>There are two theories about why Japanese troops expanded their defenses. One theory is that because the Zhongshan Hidei case was tried and sentenced yesterday, the Japanese troops were putting on a show of force. Another theory is that the barbed wire at the key intersections on North Sichuan Road had already been erected late the night before. This was because a Japanese warship secretly arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 AM yesterday morning, carrying a large number of Japanese troops and military equipment. To avoid drawing attention, the Japanese troops erected the barbed wire. Traffic was once cut off when the Japanese troops landed and transported equipment.</p>
<p>Japanese Embassy and Consulate Offer No Comment</p>
<p>Japanese diplomats have not commented on the actions of Japanese troops. The reporter went to the Japanese embassy to inquire yesterday. The representative of its information department replied to the reporter with the usual response, saying that they do not know the Marine Corps' actions unless they voluntarily publish them. Furthermore, the newly appointed Third Secretary of the Japanese Embassy stated that he had gone to Beijing a few days ago to meet with Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, report his arrival in Shanghai, and convey instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning with another secretary of the Japanese Embassy who had previously gone to Beijing.</p>

<p>No Significant Progress in Heart Condition</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi, came to Shanghai last month to seek treatment for a tooth ailment at the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital. He then moved to the Hongqiao Sanitarium and Hospital to treat his heart condition. It is now learned that Mr. Yang's bad tooth has been extracted and he is currently having a denture fitted. However, there has been no significant progress in his heart condition. Mr. Yang originally planned to go to Guangdong to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but later learned that Chairman Chiang was about to leave Guangdong, so he stopped his trip south. Then, when Chairman Chiang arrived in Jiangxi from Guangdong, Mr. Yang telegraphed to inquire about the location and time for a meeting. As soon as he receives a reply, he will proceed to meet with him according to instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Hosted the National Goods Exhibition, Which Opened Yesterday; Wang Xiaolai Cut the Ribbon and Xu Xiaochu Raised the Flag; Dozens of Representatives from Party and Government Circles Attended <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Exhibition Hall, held a National Goods Exhibition at Jing'an Temple Road. It opened at 2:00 PM yesterday. Many guests from all walks of life attended. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Attending</p>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition is scheduled to last for three weeks. If needed, the exhibition period can be extended. At the same time, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Exhibition Hall will also expand its scope and display samples of national goods for people to visit. The guests of honor attending the opening ceremony yesterday included President Wang Xiaolai, Vice President Xu Xiaochu, Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Song Zhongqing from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Sun Daosheng from the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, Xu Genghua from the National Goods Maintenance Association, Wang Xingyao from the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and committee members and representatives from various manufacturers, including Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, Pan Yangyao, Zhang Huikang, Yuan Ludeng, Mao Heyuan, Fang Jiaobo, Fang Jiange, Luo Qinghua, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Exhibition Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The exhibition venue had two entrances, both with brightly colored archways that were very eye-catching. Inside, each manufacturer arranged and displayed their products according to their respective locations. There were many styles and a wide variety of products, indicating the rapid progress of national goods. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts maintained order inside and outside the venue, and staff from the association were on-site to take care of matters. At the opening ceremony, the Municipal Police Bureau band played music, and Zhu Boyuan served as the master of ceremonies. President Wang Xiaolai cut the ribbon to the music, and then Vice President Xu Xiaochu raised the flag of the National Goods Exhibition. Then, they led the guests to visit various parts of the venue and distributed special issues of the conference. Finally, tea and refreshments were served until 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Then, Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported: "Distinguished guests, it is our great honor that you have graced the opening of the National Goods Exhibition today. The main reason for holding this exhibition is to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Goods Exhibition Hall. It has achieved many accomplishments in the past, so we are launching this exhibition as a commemoration. The Goods Exhibition Hall is affiliated with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and is dedicated to promoting national goods. For example, it has hosted national goods exhibitions, added national goods bazaars, assisted overseas Chinese and foreigners in purchasing national goods, and introduced the buying and selling of national goods. It has a considerable history in the national goods industry. Today, we will continue to strive to uphold our original intentions. However, because preparations were rushed, many things may be lacking. We sincerely hope that patriotic men and women will provide guidance."</p>
<p>President's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Vice President Xu Xiaochu gave a speech: "Our association believes that in this era of commercial warfare, to promote the development of domestic goods, we must create more opportunities for producers and consumers to interact. National goods exhibitions are the best way to achieve this because they allow manufacturers to understand how to improve, and the public can purchase without being fooled by foreign imitations. In recent years, due to changes in the mindset of the Chinese people and the efforts of promotion, the trade deficit has been decreasing. This is a good sign of strengthening the country. I hope that everyone will continue to uphold their patriotic intentions, promote and advocate, so that the national goods industry can flourish." Hu Xiyuan, Pan Yangyao, Wang Xingyao, and others then gave speeches. At the same time, for the sake of widespread publicity, Zhou Bangjun will be broadcasting on the Sino-Western Radio Station and Xu Xiaochu will be broadcasting on the Mainland Radio Station every day.</p>
<p>General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>Tracing back to our Chinese nation, since the opening of the seas in the late Qing Dynasty, the great powers have relied on their unequal treaties as a talisman to carry out economic aggression against us, dumping their surplus products. Like mercury pouring to the ground, they have flooded in and seized markets everywhere. The Chinese people have been fickle, worshiping foreign goods, resulting in an outflow of money and endless troubles. Self-sufficient industries and businesses have been destroyed, and the unemployed population has increased, causing social and economic decline. However, merchants are still bound by old laws, stuck in their ways. Craftsmen are still sticking to old rules, not thinking about improvements. Others use machinery while we are only manual. How can we stem the tide of the trade deficit? Since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people have suffered under the threat of imperialism, deeply feeling the pain of economic aggression. They know that to save the country and resist insults, invigorating national goods is essential. As a result, factories have been gradually established everywhere, and the output of national goods has been increasing day by day. However, there is a lack of communication and cooperation, resulting in very little effect. Patriotic people are deeply troubled by this, and are collecting samples of national goods, setting up exhibition halls, leading to observation and encouraging their use, so as to increase identification capabilities and avoid confusion with imitations. This is the best method. Unfortunately, it is often motivated by temporary indignation. After things have passed, they give up. They never finish what they start, leaving foreigners with the criticism of a "five-minute fever." There has never been anyone who has persevered, redoubling their efforts, like our Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Goods Exhibition Hall, which has been established since 1921, holding on with perseverance and determination, not being discouraged by adverse environments, nor stopping halfway due to bleak prospects. Isn't this how national goods should be promoted? One cannot expect to achieve everything in one fell swoop. However, their spirit of perseverance and hard work can serve as a model for our manufacturers. Therefore, on the occasion of this 15th anniversary, we must commemorate it. Thinking about today's environment, although the national goods industry has been promoted by people all over the country, it has declined as before, and social and economic panic has deepened. Could it be that the Chinese people are still stuck in the misconception that domestic goods must be crude and foreign goods must be superior, and are rejecting domestic goods? Or are there those who have lost their minds and are replacing domestic goods with foreign goods, changing their appearance? These two are obstacles to the future of domestic goods, and those who love and use domestic goods should pay attention, and our manufacturers should strive to improve day and night. Therefore, in addition to the celebration, we are holding an expanded national goods exhibition, collecting and displaying new and old products from various factories to seek advice from the Chinese people. We hope that those who love and use national goods and want to recognize national goods will carefully distinguish them to avoid being deceived. Those who believe that national goods must be crude will also know that today's national goods are no longer what they used to be. We also hope that everyone will evaluate which ones are superior, which ones are inferior, which ones are suitable for society, and which ones are out of date, and provide guidance as much as possible, so as to improve them. We must be of one mind, help each other, cooperate, and persevere to make the national goods industry flourish day by day, and comfort the grand plan of the founders of the Exhibition Hall. This is what the manufacturers are praying for.</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Japanese Marine Case Was Announced Today; Lawyers on Both Sides Hold Their Own Reasons; Debate Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The case of Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng (nicknamed Little Guangdong), Zhou Sherong, etc., all from Guangdong, who are accused of killing Japanese marine Zhongshan Hideio, was previously announced to be concluded by the First Special District Court. However, because witnesses still needed to be questioned, the announcement was revoked and the investigation was continued. The fingerprints of Yang Wendao and Yang Jianzhong and the books hiding the handgun found in Yang's house were sent to the Zhenru Forensic Medicine Institute for identification. On the 24th of last month, the institute sent a detailed report of the identification results to the court. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye and Assessors Feng Shide and Xiao Xiefei</p>
<p>convened a collegiate bench for deliberation. Prosecutor Tang also attended the court to perform his duties. The security inside and outside the courtroom remained strict, but only ordinary personnel from the Japanese side attended the hearing, with no armed soldiers. After the judges took their seats, they first ordered Clerk Ding Zhongnan to read the identification report from the Forensic Medicine Institute. Then, Presiding Judge Qian questioned Yang Wendao about the origin of the books. Yang still denied that he owned the books. The court then announced that the evidence had been fully investigated and ordered the debate to begin. The reasons that had been stated previously should not be repeated. First, the lawyer for the police, Ru Baoyi, spoke, stating that after the</p>
<p>re-investigation of the evidence, the testimonies of witnesses who appeared in court, such as Pan Qiaoying and Yang Jianzhong, were sufficient to supplement the points that were still unclear and doubtful before. Therefore, after the witnesses testified, he felt that the facts investigated previously were very clear, and Yang Wendao claimed that the book containing the gun found in his house was planted by Yang Jianzhong. Yang Jianzhong also testified in court that he had no intention of planting the evidence, and the Forensic Medicine Institute had verified that there were no Jianzhong fingerprints on the book, so Wendao bears full responsibility for this book. In addition, there were no new developments regarding the two defendants, Ye and Zhou, and the testimonies from other aspects were sufficient to prove that they were consistent with Ye's</p>
<p>confession, and that the confession was credible. In short, the case has reached a point where there is no doubt, and he requested that the defendants be sentenced to death. Then, lawyers Tang Huaiqun and Guo Qiming defended Yang Wendao and Zhou Sherong, mainly focusing on the point that the book containing the gun was found in Yang's house. Since the Forensic Medicine Institute had verified that there were no fingerprints of Yang Jianzhong in the book, Yang Wendao's claim that it was planted by Jianzhong was not credible, but the institute also verified that there were no fingerprints of Yang Wendao left in the book, so it could be determined that the book was not the original book found in Yang's house. Yang</p>
<p>was not involved with the book. Zhou was falsely implicated by Ye. They should both be acquitted. Finally, lawyers Zhang Zhirang, Wang Shizong, Fan Gang, and others defended Ye Haisheng. They all stated that many of the testimonies of the witnesses who were called this time were in favor of the defendant, especially Pan Qiaoying's statement that she saw the murderer walking shoulder to shoulder with the victim before the shooting was consistent with the forensic examination of the victim's injuries, which was enough to</p>
<p>break Ye's confession that he fired the shot. Finally, Prosecutor Tang rose to argue, stating that the case had been heard many times, and he requested that a judgment be made according to the law. Presiding Judge Qian then announced the conclusion of the debate and set the judgment for the afternoon of the second day (today). He also ordered that the defendants be returned to custody.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Sino-Japanese international wireless telephone service in February, Yokohama, Osaka, Tokyo, Nagoya, Kyoto, and other places have successively opened calls with Shanghai. Hakodate and Otaru in Hokkaido have completed preparations and opened calls with this city at noon yesterday. Beforehand, the International Telecommunications Bureau and the Japanese Telecommunications Bureau in Hakodate and Otaru had trial calls, and the sound was exceptionally clear. The call fee is the same as other areas: 15 yuan for each three-minute call, and 5 yuan is added for each additional minute.</p>

<p>Liu Hantao, Chuan Chaofu, Yin Jiafu, Wang Dongcai, Guan Yaoting, and other five members of the Blood Soul Assassination Corps were arrested for throwing bombs at shops in the International Settlement. They were sentenced to imprisonment by the First Special Court. The French Concession police, after finding that Liu and others had also committed similar crimes in the French Concession, requested the Second Special Court to transfer Liu and others to the case for investigation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case was found by the French Police Department to be that the defendants threw bombs at Xie Da Xiang Foreign Goods Store on Xiaodongmen Street, Yuanhe Sugar Store at 130 Minquan Road, Bei Runsheng's house on Beile Road, Deshengxiang Foreign Goods Store on Fada Road, and Rixinsheng Foreign Goods Store on the afternoon of November 18, 1935. The lawyer from the Medical Affairs Office filed a public lawsuit based on Article 151, Article 154, and Article 181 of the Criminal Law for disrupting order and endangering public safety. Yesterday morning, Assessor Chen Shuoying from the Second Special Court continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. According to Liu Hantao's confession, he joined the Assassination Corps in 1933. Wang Tiemin gave him a bomb in Yuqing Lane on Nanjing Road and ordered him to throw it at Xie Da Xiang in Xiaodongmen. He gave a warning at the counter door. Chuan Chaofu confessed that he joined the Assassination Corps because he knew Wang Dongcai and was introduced by him. He had never thrown a bomb, but he knew that they had bombed twice. The agency was in Zhang Zilian's house. On July 28 of this year, he went to Zhang's house to ask for a job. Zhang sent Zhang Zongfu to see him and told him to go again on August 3. When he went there, he was arrested. Yin Jiafu confessed that he joined the group in the first half of 1933. They went to see the location and asked him to throw the bomb. The first time was a sugar shop in the 16th pier, the second time was Deshengxiang Foreign Goods Store on Fada Road, and the third time was Rixinsheng Foreign Goods Store. He was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison with a two-year reprieve. The bomb was made of sulfur and would not hurt people. Wang Dongcai confessed that he joined the group in the second half of 1932. The agency was in the distribution office of the Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory. He went with Yin to throw bombs twice, and he went to Bei Runsheng's house alone once. Guan Yaoting confessed that he threw a bomb at Yufeng Foreign Goods Store in Dongxinqiao once. Then, Zhang Hengzhong, a staff member of Yufeng Store, testified that he found a bomb exploding at the window at 6:00 PM one day in May 1933, shattering the glass. He did not know them. In addition, Wang Yanong, the representative of Bei Runsheng, appeared in court. The court ordered Bei himself to appear in court for questioning next time. Then, the lawyer from the Police Department stated that in addition to prosecuting Chuan Chaofu under Article 154 of the Criminal Law, the remaining defendants were prosecuted under Article 151 and Article 187 of the Criminal Law. The court verified the words and adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 14th and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.</p>

<p>The British-owned Hua Mao Laundry Company at 1178 Pingliang Road, Hongkou, recently fired four workers without cause and drove the workers out of the store, causing a labor dispute. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce advised them to endure and resume work first, waiting for the Party and government agencies to resolve the matter. Unexpectedly, the company's female manager, Ms. Carroll, fired five more people, Zhu Laifu, Chen Kaibao, Chen Haiding, Chen Baoliang, and Wu Xiaofu. Yesterday, Cen Xinglai was also fired. The double wages that the fired workers were about to be paid were also deducted. At the same time, the company advertised to recruit new workers, so the labor dispute deteriorated. The labor side is now seeking assistance from the Party and government.</p>

<p>The corpse burial case at Hongkou Women's Hospital, 290 Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, which shocked the entire city, and the hospital claimed that Zhang Wenhua's concubine, Liang Meiyu, had escaped without a trace. Subsequently, Huang Fugen and Cui Chengke, the Chinese detectives in charge of the case from the Huishan Police Station, sent Fei Wangshi, a maid from Wuxi in the hospital, to the First Special District Court. After investigation, she was released. Later, at 11:30 AM on the 13th of last month, Chen Pengfei (23 years old), a native of the area and the former driver of Zhang Wenhua, was arrested again at the French Concession Car Affairs Office. The details of his testimony were sent to the criminal court for questioning and have been recorded in this newspaper. After receiving the order to change the date of adjudication, Chen was temporarily detained. Yesterday morning, Assessor Zhong Qing visited the court for a continued hearing. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that Chen Pengfei had been thoroughly investigated and clarified during the rescheduling and that there was no relationship. Please revoke the warrant. Judge Zhong ordered Chen Pengfei to be released.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Courtroom Packed; Continued Hearing of the Box Murder Case; Mao A'gen and Jiang Yuan'tan Completely Retract Confessions; Resolutely Deny Killing Caiying <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Only Lin Gendi Speaks Unequivocally</p>
<p>Since the headless box murder case occurred, although the Hongkou Police Department's Chinese detectives Huang Fusen, Liu Zhaonian, etc., captured three female suspects, Lin Gendi, Mao A'gen, and Jiang Qian'yuan Tan, the testimonies of Mao and Jiang were inconsistent, sometimes admitting and sometimes denying, making the case confusing and difficult to understand. Zhong Qing, the judge of the First Special District Court presiding over the case, personally visited the scene of the incident at 3 Cunfu Lane, Baibao Road, for an on-site investigation in order to understand the truth. However, the outcome did not yield many clues. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM was the scheduled date for the continued hearing of the case. The general public, driven by curiosity, flocked to the court to listen, so the large second courtroom was</p>
<p>packed to the rafters, and many were turned away. The defendant Mao A'gen hired lawyer Fan Gang, and Jiang Qian'yuan Tan hired lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang, to defend them in court. First, Judge Zhong questioned the defendant Lin Gendi. According to Lin, her previous testimony about Mao and Jiang killing Caiying was entirely true. As for disposing of the body, it was on the third day after the killing. Counting the day of the killing, it should be the fourth day, so</p>
<p>the day of the crime was definitely August 8th. However, she did not hold Caiying's mouth at the time, and Caiying did not cry for help. She only saw her feet twitching slightly. After Chang Jiang used an ax to injure Caiying's head, she ran away, and so on. According to Mao A'gen Hong, on August 8th, from 3 PM onwards, he drove the second-in-command of the fire brigade's car to the Gonghexiang Wharf to send passengers onto ships. At around 4 PM, he drove the car again to take the chief to the Hongkou Fire Brigade to play ball. At 8 PM, he went to the Yangshupu Weituoma Road Water Plant at the request of a friend. At that time, the chief ordered the car to be parked at the Yangshupu Police Department. It was not until midnight that he drove the car again to pick up the chief and take him home, so regarding</p>
<p>the killing of Caiying, not only was he completely unaware, but he also had no time to participate. Police Department lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the Police Department had already obtained Mao A'gen Jiang Yuanying's work reports from August 7th onwards. However, regarding the work on August 8th, there was a separate form, which recorded roughly the same as what Mao had stated, but in the afternoon, the car was not driven out. After the last adjournment, the Police Department had sent Mao to the Engineering Bureau Hospital, and Lin Gendi was sent to the Guangren Hospital. Both were examined and found to have gonorrhea, but whether they had syphilis could</p>
<p>not be determined. Regarding the last time, lawyer Fan Gang raised the newspaper report that the Engineering Bureau doctor had stated that the body was killed no more than 24 hours before it was discovered. However, the Police Department had also investigated, and according to the Engineering Bureau Hospital's report, the maximum was 24 hours because modern medicine really cannot clarify this point. Moreover, Mao had admitted everything the last time the court went to the Police Department to question him, so he did not know why he suddenly retracted his confession today, and so on. The court immediately questioned Mao based on this. According to him, the reason for his previous admission was because he could not bear the suffering and made a false confession. In reality, that was not the case. He was also asked</p>
<p>where the deceased's clothes were now. He answered that he really did not know. Jiang Yuanying was also questioned and completely denied it. "In good conscience, I have never seen Caiying. The reason I confessed last time was because I could not bear the torture," and so on. At this time, the defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, immediately stated that this case concerns human life and is of great importance. Therefore, whether Caiying existed, whether she had family members, and whether she lived at No. 2 Cunfu Lane, where she lived before, and her usual interactions with Lin Gendi, etc., all need to be thoroughly investigated. Lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang also requested that the Public Security Bureau investigate the household registration to clarify whether Caiying lived there. Then, Judge Zhong announced,</p>
<p>"During the autopsy, the forensic doctor determined that the deceased was still alive when she was killed and was not stabbed after death," and so on. When questioned about Lin Gendi's testimony, he said that he had only known the reporter for a week, and they were both female receptionists at the Daxin Company amusement park for only three days. Her accent seemed to be from Changzhou. Mao A'gen also testified that on August 11th, he drove the car until 4:50 PM before returning to the fire brigade. At that time, he bathed, washed clothes, and after dinner, he played mahjong with fire brigade members No. 100 and No. 125, etc., for a thousand rounds. How could he have any free time to</p>
<p>go to dispose of the body? It was all Lin Gendi's false accusation. Lin immediately argued with Mao upon hearing this, saying that it was not a false accusation. The court then asked Mao whether he had gone to the Zhonghua Hotel with Lin Gendi on August 9th to open a room. Mao denied it. Then, the tea boy from the Zhonghua Hotel testified that around 11 PM on the 9th, someone did come to open a room. Then, they heard a woman's voice in the room, but they did not know whether it was Lin Gendi. The court then asked Lin Gendi, "When you disposed of the body, was it already smelly?" He answered</p>
<p>that it did not smell yet. Then, Chinese detective Huang Fusen testified that between 2:55 PM and 3:30 PM on September 21st, he took Lin Gendi to the Daxin Amusement Park to meet a Zhang surname inspector, who took out all the photos of the female tea servers and asked Lin to identify them. However, Lin said that there was no photo of Caiying in the photos. At that time, according to Inspector Zhang, Caiying had only worked for three days and was not an official female tea server, so there was no photo. He also stated that when Lin Gendi</p>
<p>was a female tea server at the company, she was fired for stealing someone else's wallet. Later, the two defendants, Mao and Jiang, pleaded with the small foreman Xiao Debao, and she was reinstated. Now, the Zhang surname has resigned. If the court believes it is necessary to summon him, he can be found again. Judge Zhong, considering that this case is of great importance and has many doubtful points, should be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, he ruled that the case be adjourned to the afternoon of the 15th of this month for further hearing, and summoned the person in charge of managing the female tea servers at the Daxin Company and the old woman who lived at No. [blank] Cunfu Lane to appear in court as witnesses.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Fearing Non-Filial Thoughts from Foster Father; Young Girl Unwilling to Return Home; Wang Guangting's Deceitful Intentions; Wang Xiaomei Sent to Jiliang Institute <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaomei, a 14-year-old girl from Anhui, was recently brought to Shanghai by a neighbor, a woman surnamed Chen, and stayed with a fellow villager, Liu Yangshi, at No. 164 Yutong Road, Zhabei. On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, at around 11 PM, she colluded with Chen Debiao, Chen Hongjun, Yang Jucai, and others who were on the run, and sold her to Wang Guangting (47 years old), a Shandong native residing at No. 45, Lane 818, Tangshan Road, for 90 yuan as his daughter, and a contract was established. She was taken home and slept in the same bed with him without incident. The next night, late at night, Wang took advantage of the girl's deep sleep and secretly removed her pants, touching her lower body with his hand. The girl woke up and stopped him. The next morning, the girl, fearing that Wang would rape her, secretly fled without a trace. Wang, in a state of anxiety, reported the incident to the Huishan Police Department, which dispatched detective Zhang Youming to investigate. At 8:30 PM that evening, the girl was found on the Bund of Nanjing Road. However, the girl was unwilling to return home. After questioning and learning the truth, he [blank] reported to the head of the police and rushed to the address to arrest Wang Guangting, and took the purchase contract together to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Engineering Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and stated that the defendant had confessed at the police station that he had bought Wang Xiaomei in order to marry her to his nephew, named Jinshan, as a child bride. He requested an extension for a detailed investigation, and so on. The purchase contract was presented for inspection. Wang Xiaomei testified that she was 14 years old, born on the second day of the first month of the lunar calendar. Her father's name was Wang Guangsheng, and her brother's name was Dahai Zi. Her mother and she were both farmers in Tuqiao Township, Wuhe County, in her hometown. Half a month ago, she was led to Shen by a neighbor, a woman surnamed Chen, about 30 years old, without her mother's knowledge. She also described the process in detail. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Regarding the matter of touching the girl's genitals with his hand, he said that he wanted to know whether she was indeed female and could bear children, and that there was no other intention. He pleaded for leniency. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing to investigate and verify the matter. Wang Xiaomei was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for foster care.</p>

Its ears, eyes, mouth, and nose were perfectly depicted. Its eyes were fingering prayer beads, its hands were clasped in a lotus position, and its simple and honest appearance was more remarkable than the carvings of artists. Xiang was overjoyed to obtain this treasure and cherished it, unwilling to show it to others easily, intending to sell it for a good price.</p>

<p>Sun Fuxi, the president of the Yifeng Society, wrote an article entitled "Congratulating the Three Heroines' Painting Exhibition on Its Success in Promoting Abroad." The following is an excerpt of the main points: Chinese flowers have made brilliant contributions in literature and painting. Not only has the depiction of flowers established rich and excellent characteristics in Chinese art and literature, but it has also opened up a vast and beautiful area for world art and literature. The Western art world greatly admires the superb and profound depiction of Chinese flowers, feeling inferior. This is because Chinese literature and painting can use extremely subtle observation and extremely flexible rendering, not only capturing the likeness of the form but also expressing the spirit vividly and with vitality. Furthermore, through symbolic methods, everything can be imbued with life, and everything can represent human emotions. Thus, there is poetry in painting, and painting in poetry. Beautiful women and fragrant herbs can all convey the greatest emotions of joy, anger, love, and hate. Those who recently ridiculed romantic poetry as indulging in pleasure and neglecting ambition do not understand the true meaning of flowers and the moon in Chinese art and literature but merely criticize their misuse. The Xiong sisters are three conjoined flowers of China. Their depiction of flowers deeply captures the essence of the Ouxiang school. This time, they have been sent by the Ministry to various countries in the West to hold exhibitions of their works, which can greatly promote the brilliance of Chinese art. With this in mind, I wish them success in advance.</p>

<p>Zhu Qingxi from Wuxi opened the Laotongchuntang Pharmacy at No. 1695 Zhoujiaqiao, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. Recently, due to poor business, he came up with a whimsical idea to make pills in the store, forging instructions and posing as Lei Yuanshang's Liushen Pills. His shop assistant, Lu Chuntao, peddled them everywhere and set up sales points. At the Tongrentang Pharmacy opened by Cao Guilin from Yancheng at No. 1197, Xiaoyou Lane, Haige Road, Xujiahui, they were mixed and sold in the market, reaching tens of thousands, causing great harm to patients. The owner of Lei Yuanshang shop became aware of this and reported it to the French police, requesting arrest.

<p>Yasuoling Assoniran, the Spanish manager of the Jai Alai court at No. 303 Ya'erpe Road in the French Concession, had repeatedly received threatening letters from gangsters last month, intending to extort 5 million in national currency. After Yasuoling reported this to the French police, Yasuoling received another letter on the 28th of last month, stating that if he was sincerely interested in contacting them, he could send a letter addressed to Huang Yuanliang, Room 232, Dongya Hotel, Xianshi Company, Nanjing Road. The French police then created a letter and ordered detectives to go to the hotel to investigate together with detectives from the Laozha Police Station. There was no Huang Yuanliang there. They put the letter in the glass box specifically for letters, and the French police's Chinese detective Bureau Bu Guang, detective Diao Linsheng, and Lao Zha Police Station's Chinese detective Chen Shanjie waited there. Until 3:35 PM yesterday afternoon, Yang Yiping (also known as A Baiyang, English name Albest Radriges, 24 years old) from Fujian went to the glass box of the Dongya Hotel to pick up the letter addressed to Huang Yuanliang. He was immediately arrested by the detectives and taken back to the Lao Zha Police Station. According to Yang, he was going to Dongya to find his friend Huang Yuanliang. Because he saw the letter, he picked it up on his behalf, but he was unexpectedly arrested. He also stated that he was from [blank] and the police went to the US Consulate to investigate. However, because Yang could not provide any proof, the US Consulate denied it. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court 1 of the Special First District Court. Judge Feng Shide questioned him and police lawyer Ru Bao Yi clarified the situation and stated that French police had been sent to the court today and requested a transfer. However, because there was not enough time, the official documents could not be brought to court and should be presented later. Then, the detectives submitted a report on the arrest of the various culprits. When questioned, Yang Yiping completely denied having any extortionary behavior. Judge Feng Shide verified the confessions and ordered that Yang be handed over to the French police to be taken back.</p>

In order to congratulate the success of the conference and to thank the guests, Yong An Tang has specially reduced the prices of its medicines. However, each person is limited to purchasing only ten packs or ten bottles of each type. Because the medicine deeply meets the needs of the public, the number of buyers was very crowded at one time, and the supply could not meet the demand. A quick decision was made to obtain goods from the main store. The first day, more than 400 yuan was sold, and so on.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 10 AM, Zhang Huachang of the Second Team of the Pengpu District Defense Corps, Zhabei, arrested a medical woman, Yang Zhangshi, together with a medicine box. First, Zhang Huachang stated that he was 26 years old, from Funing, and lived in a shack at the end of Datong Road. His daughter, named Adi, was only three years old. On the morning of the 13th of this lunar month, she fell ill and Yang Zhangshi was called for treatment, costing him six jiao of foreign currency. She gave pills to swallow. The next morning, he felt that the illness had worsened, so he called the woman again, costing him four jiao of small foreign currency. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, the illness became more critical. He went to reason with her. The woman made all sorts of excuses. He learned that the woman had not registered with the Health Bureau and was actually fraudulently obtaining money as a quack doctor who was killing people. Therefore, he escorted her to the team and requested an investigation. Yang Zhangshi stated that she was 50 years old, a local, and lived at No. 875 Yongxing Road. She had been practicing medicine for nearly ten years, specializing in pediatrics. Today (yesterday), a Jiangbei person came and requested a consultation, so she took the medicine box to the patient's home. Unexpectedly, while passing by the end of Datong Road, Zhang Yechang and others grabbed her, falsely accusing her of incorrectly prescribing medicine. While the interrogation was in progress, Ju Xiangfan submitted to the team, stating that he was 29 years old, a local resident, and lived at No. 7 Zhangjia Muqiao. His daughter, who was only 40 days old, had "mantis seeds" in her mouth on the 24th of this lunar month. He asked Yang Zhangshi for treatment and paid one yuan for the doctor's fee, stating that it would guarantee a cure. After the woman cut and treated it with a knife, it was swollen and painful and she could not eat milk. On the 28th, he asked her to examine it again, and she gave a pill to swallow, which was still ineffective. She died at 7 PM on the 29th. His daughter was actually cut to death by the woman. Today, he went to the woman's home to negotiate and learned that she had been escorted to the team. Therefore, he submitted a case and requested a joint investigation. Upon further questioning of Zhangshi, she admitted to receiving one yuan in doctor's fees for cutting the "mantis seeds." The team, after verifying the confession, was preparing to prepare a document to transfer it to the Xin [blank] Branch. A family member of Zhang Huachang submitted to the team that Zhang's daughter had also died at around 3 PM that afternoon. The interrogating officer, considering that Yang Zhangshi was practicing medicine without a license and disregarding human life, ordered that the 15 medicine bottles and 6 packets of powdered medicine found in the medicine box, including one packet of opium ash and four wooden turtles, be transferred to the Xin Zha Branch for disposal.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Lun Chang Textile Company; Accounting Clerk Embezzled; Exchanged Received Payments for Bank Drafts; All Could Not Be Cashed Upon Maturity <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shisheng, from Haiyan, 35 years old, served as an accounting clerk at the British Lun Chang Textile Dyeing and Printing Company at No. 220 Sichuan Road, 5th Floor. In April of last year, Lu successively embezzled the accounts received from various Hakka customers and paid the company with bank drafts from the Huaming Bank at the intersection of Henan Road and Jiujiang Road. However, the bank closed on April 23 of last year, resulting in a portion of the Huaming Bank drafts received by Lun Chang Company that could not be cashed, totaling 10,241 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 fen. After the company discovered Lu's fraud, it reported it to the General Patrol Room, and Lu fled as a result. Although the police investigated, they could not capture him. Until 11:25 AM the day before yesterday, the General Patrol Room learned that Lu Yinsheng was hiding in the Nanyang Primary School on Zhaofeng Road, Longhua. Chinese detective Zhang Mingde, detective Song Yuanshan, Kang Zengxiang, etc., went together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau and captured Lu. With the consent of the Public Security Bureau, they were taken back to the Patrol Room. Under interrogation, Lu confessed that the Huaming Bank was opened by his colleagues at Lun Chang, Shen Nianzu and Qian Fuqu, in 1933. They asked him to help exchange the bank drafts from various large Qian Banks received from Hakka customers for Huaming's bank drafts. At the time, he did not agree. Then, Lu Baoshu, the current sales director of the spot goods department of Lun Chang Company, who was from Nanxiang, smoothed things over with him, and he complied. Initially, the bank's bank drafts could still be cashed, but unexpectedly, it closed later, and so on. The police detectives then went to Lun Chang and arrested Lu Baoshu. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court 1 of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi clarified the situation and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 339 and Article 346 of the Criminal Law for fraud and breach of trust. Then, Tweedie, the representative of Lun Chang Company, clarified the process of receiving Huaming Bank's bank drafts. When questioned, Lu Yinsheng's confession remained the same as before, while Lu Baoshu firmly denied smoothing things over with Lu Yinsheng on behalf of the Huaming Bank and hired lawyer Lu Congzu to defend him, requesting permission to negotiate. After Judge Feng Shide verified the confession, he ordered the case to be adjourned for one week for further hearing. Lu Baoshu was allowed to post a shop guarantee of 1,000 yuan.</p>

Ma Yinchu gave the closing speech (recorded separately). Hu Qingrong, Xi Yushu, Chuan Rulin, Zhu Shaoping, Bu Kai, and others then spoke successively, acknowledging the great contribution of this annual meeting of the society to the important issues facing Chinese society and the economy today. National economic issues have been generally recognized by the public as important problems for society and the nation. The society's members, based on their academic and professional knowledge, can contribute to society and the nation, which is of great benefit. It is hoped that they will continue to work hard for the country and society in this spirit. The event ended happily at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Closing Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Ma Yinchu delivered a closing speech, summarized as follows: (1) The 13th Annual Meeting of our society was held in Shanghai. We are very grateful for the sincere hospitality of various cultural groups and industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai. (2) The number of our society's members has increased year by year. Branches have been established in Hunan, Guangdong, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Members are either specialized in academics or have extensive experience. The goal is to establish a very close connection between academic thought and the actual environment. (3) The country has faced many difficulties in recent years. Facing the oppression of strong neighbors, a glimmer of hope remains. Saving the nation depends entirely on the cooperation of the academic and business communities. (4) In recent years, domestic capital has been depleted, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the purchasing power of the majority of the people in the country is weak, affecting industry and commerce. To seek economic revival, we must attach equal importance to agriculture and industry. Our country's biggest problem lies in one-sided or partial development. The difference between rural areas and cities (such as Shanghai) is almost a hundred years. This is not enough to plan for the overall economy in peacetime, and it is not easy to resist foreign aggression in wartime. We must develop national transportation, connecting east, west, north, and south, develop inland resources, improve the lives of farmers, and ensure that agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining develop equally and consistently, without any imbalance. Only then can we talk about prosperity and equality. If all the country's floating capital is concentrated in Shanghai, used solely for speculation in peacetime, and then flees overseas in wartime, both the national economy and the people's livelihood will suffer. We must be wary of this. I hope the financial giants in Shanghai will pay attention to this. (5) Finally, I hope that members of our society will work even harder for the society's affairs than before. We ask that anyone who studies economics, as well as those who have achieved success in the business community, be introduced at any time to achieve the purpose of collective wisdom. (6) Under today's circumstances, academic thought should not be too far removed from the environment, but must stand on the front line as the standard for all actions of the society. For example, our country only has a financial market, not a capital market. Even this financial market is very disorganized. Therefore, members of our society who occupy important positions in the financial community, such as Mr. Xu Jilun, Jin Luqin, Wang Zhixin, Zhang Naiqi, and Yang Yinpu, have spared no effort in promoting bill discounting and acceptance, which has now become a reality. This alone proves that thought is the mother of fact, but this kind of thought should adapt to the needs of society and not be too far removed from the environment. Now some people are advocating a capital market, opening stock trading in the stock exchange, and selling prices of company bonds, so that social floating capital can move from the road of speculation to investment, giving the agricultural, industrial, and mining industries the opportunity to use domestic capital. Isn't this a major undertaking at present? I hope that members of our society will continue to work hard to achieve success. (7) Recently, I read in the newspapers that Rogers, who returned to China with Sir Ross last time, is now back in China as a financial advisor to our country. It is said that it is very difficult for China to use foreign capital because there are many obstacles. I believe that to seek economic recovery, we must use foreign capital. Since it is so difficult to use foreign capital, we can only use domestic capital to make up for the deficiency. Therefore, domestic capital must not be squandered on foreigners again. Recently, I heard that people in Shanghai with capital are engaged in speculative trading of foreign stocks and securities. According to a famous lawyer in Shanghai, this speculation often leads to lawsuits, and Chinese people always lose, causing countless bankruptcies. Millions of good money are unconditionally squandered in the hands of foreigners, which is truly inexcusable. I hope the financial authorities will ban it as soon as possible. Even if they cannot ban it, they should at least regulate it. Brokers must register, and transactions must pay evidence money, so that speculation will have a certain limit. I hope that members of this society and various cultural groups will work together to promote this, create an atmosphere first, and then implement regulation. (8) From the perspective of today's national situation, free competition and free trade are not suitable for China, because some countries are using improper methods to seize our business. Since the methods are improper, competition is not free. We should also resist it with unfree methods. The so-called unfree method is regulation. Regulation means using the power of the group to achieve the purpose of self-salvation. To seek China's freedom, we must sacrifice individual freedom. If 400 million compatriots sing freedom, they will be like a pile of loose sand, how can they resist foreign aggression? If the whole country can proceed in unison, a small enemy country is not to be feared. Now it is a matter of life and death. I hope that everyone present has a very clear understanding of today's economic issues.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Our Country's Olympic Delegation Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon; Li Huitang, Who Passed Through Hong Kong Yesterday Morning, Has Landed; Wang Zhengting Talks About Popularizing Sports as Soon as Possible <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the National Sports Advancement Association received a telegram from Wang Zhengting, the leader of the Olympic delegation, from Hong Kong, stating, "The entire delegation is on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso and has now safely arrived in Hong Kong. It will arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow (3rd) afternoon."</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st: Our Olympic delegation of more than one hundred people, led by Wang Zhengting, returned home from Europe on the Italian ship Conte Rosso. They arrived in Hong Kong at 7 a.m. on the 1st, and many people came to the port to welcome them. Except for 24 people, including Li Huitang and Yang Xiuqiong, who landed in Hong Kong, the rest returned to Shanghai on the original ship at noon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st: Wang Zhengting led the Olympic delegation through Hong Kong on the 1st on their way home and gave a speech on the ship, saying that China's sports are backward. To compete with the world's strong teams, we must strengthen our forces. To catch up, we must first popularize sports. Our country's participation in the Olympics is to attract the attention of people across the country so that they can encourage each other to strive for progress in the future. This move by our government is the first step in promoting national sports. We were warmly welcomed during this trip. The martial arts team gave many performances and were well received. The football team went to various European countries to compete. The performance against England was better than expected. The next Olympics will be held in Japan, and our country hopes to send more athletes to organize a strong team to participate.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 1st) The Olympic athletes, led by Wang Zhengting, arrived in Hong Kong at 6 a.m. on the 1st. Various sports associations sent representatives to welcome the team members. As there was not much time to stay in Hong Kong, they did not attend the welcome meeting of the Sports Association. Except for the Hong Kong and Guangdong team members, the rest returned to Shanghai on the original ship Conte Rosso. Wang Chonghui also went north on the same ship. He said that he would stay in Shanghai to treat his nasal disease. Zhengting said that our country has decided to participate in the next Olympics and will continue to train talents. As for whether East Asian peace can be maintained for four years, it is not something to be counted on. Dai Jitao is now going to India to worship Buddha and will return before the 16th. After arriving in the motherland, I have to meet with Chiang to discuss when to go to the United States, which is not yet determined. Li Huitang said that I originally intended to give up playing football, but this path is too attractive to me, and I am afraid I cannot control myself. Shanghai said that I am a professional athlete. Due to the advice of the Sports Association, I will not make any statement at this time. When the time comes, this matter will be clear. The reason for the failure of football in the Olympics is that there were no more games from the Mumbai competition until Berlin, which led to unfamiliarity with the game and allowed the British team to take advantage. Wang Yuzeng said that the reasons for the failure of basketball were fatigue from traveling, weak physique, and stage fright. The famous football players Four Knights and Yang Shuiyi continue to play for South China. Huang Jiliang is unwilling to come out again, and Bao Jiaping is undecided.</p>

<h3 id="e125">First China Association Small Ball League: Financial Report <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Small Ball Association announced that the first China Association League, organized by the Chinese Small Ball Association, has now concluded. The first organizational structure and details of the Association are recorded to serve as a review for those who promote sports.</p>
<p>Reasons for Initiation</p>
<p>The association was initiated by Xu Buyun and Wu Zhenxiang, both football stars, and Huang Yifei, a satirical artist. The principle was that the promotion of small ball in West Shanghai had caused a national sensation, but unfortunately, it was destroyed by traitors in the football world. Therefore, the three gentlemen saw this and, considering the football world in West Shanghai, prepared to organize to remove the stain on the history of small ball.</p>
<p>Various Obstacles</p>
<p>On July 16th, advertisements were placed to start registration. At that time, local thugs spread malicious rumors to disrupt the association. As a result, the association had to give up the football field borrowed from the China Industrial Factory. A few days later, an article titled "False Name to Collect Money" appeared in a certain newspaper, alluding to the matter. Mr. Wu and others simply laughed it off and continued their work. The Weiguang Sports Dining Hall was negotiated for the football field, but the terrain there was low and hindered by heavy rain. Subsequently, the White Cat football field was borrowed for the event. Various difficulties were felt at the time. Helplessly, the competition entered the first football field in West Shanghai. Two weeks later, damage to the goalposts occurred. The above facts are the circumstances leading up to the conclusion.</p>
<p>Total Revenue</p>
<p>Nineteen teams participated. The regulations only charged a registration fee, and no deposit was required. Therefore, the revenue was: Zhiyi Team 2 yuan, Kang Team 2 yuan, Kanghua Team 2 yuan, Xinghua two groups 4 yuan, Meiguang Team 2 yuan, Xi Yao Team 2 yuan, Beixing Team 2 yuan, Ganyou Team 2 yuan, Hua Team 2 yuan, Leshang Team 2 yuan, Yu Yu Team 2 yuan, Gongyi Team 2 yuan, Wan Wanwei 2 yuan, Hade Team 2 yuan, Huying Team 2 yuan, Weiguang Team 2 yuan. The Weiguang local team withdrew, and the Ya Kang Team, etc., both had their registration fees returned. The total revenue was 34 yuan.</p>
<p>Expenditure Items</p>
<p>Accounting books 8 cents, writing brush 20 cents, stamp tax 20 cents, stationery and envelopes 1.29 yuan, tent fee 2 yuan, field repair fee 2 yuan, submission fee 4.26 yuan, wire bamboo basket 1 yuan, tea 30 cents, broom 20 cents, postage 50 cents, lime 60 cents, field rental fee 8 yuan, totaling 32.73 yuan. The remaining foreign currency is 1.27 yuan (such as meeting expenses, meals, etc., are not included in this example and are borne by the initiators).</p>
<p>Tao Yang's Enthusiasm</p>
<p>Those who promote sports without sparing any effort are Mr. Tao Jinrong, chairman of Shunji Sports Association, who donated four major trophies to the association, worth dozens of yuan, and Mr. Yang Shilin, accounting director of Da Yarn Factory, who donated a plaque for the "Chinese Small Ball Association," four corner flags, and two side flags for linesmen (October 1st).</p>

<p>Mr. Xu Chengji, the representative of our country's Davis Cup tennis team, remained in England and France for competitions after the Davis Cup, and has been widely praised by people from various countries, who have hailed him as a world-class player. Recently, he participated in the International Tennis Championships organized by the French Jockey Club, but was unfortunately eliminated in the second round. Mr. Xu's competitions in Europe have now ended. According to Mr. Lin Baohua, another Davis Cup representative who returned to China earlier, he recently received a call from Mr. Xu, stating that he would be leaving Europe and returning to China in early October, and is expected to depart within days. He should arrive in Shanghai in the last week of this month. If there are no special circumstances, he plans to invite Carson, Defu, and Yu, etc., four people to go to Nanjing for an exhibition match, tentatively scheduled for the end of this month or the beginning of next month. In addition, the 24th French Chamber of Commerce Hard Court Tennis Championships in this city is scheduled for the 31st of this month and the 1st, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th of next month.

<p>TASS, September 3rd, Sochi Dispatch: Soviet athletes Kuznetsov and Leicheng have completed a long-distance swimming record off the coast of the Caucasus. Kuznetsov, a student at the Moscow Sports School, used the breaststroke to cover 59.4 kilometers, lasting 28 hours and 35 minutes. Leicheng is an engineer at the Leningrad Commercial Port, swimming 56 kilometers, staying in the water five minutes longer than Kuznetsov. During the swim, they consumed meat soup and black coffee on the surface.</p>
<p>A storm suddenly arose on the second day of swimming, and the judges immediately ordered the swimming to stop. The swimmers were all taken aboard ships, although they were reluctant to stop swimming. Afterwards, doctors examined them and proved that their pulses were normal and their bodies were healthy.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Record of the World Games Delegation's Accompanying Journey, Letter 16, Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Feng Youzhen <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In the past two months, Guangdong and Guangxi have used the excuse of resisting Japan to mobilize troops and cause disturbances. However, this has been opposed by national public opinion and Guangdong generals. The Guangdong issue has been resolved peacefully very quickly. This proves that Chinese soldiers now have a sense of unity and are not subject to the coercion of a few ambitious individuals. This reminds us of many historical lessons of unity against foreign enemies. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the German princes were unable to cooperate because some of the princes wanted to obtain interests on the right bank of the Rhine. During the Basel Peace Negotiations in 1795, the left bank of the Rhine was ceded to France. From then on, Germany's national power declined. In 1806, Napoleon disregarded everything and organized the Rhine Confederation. The confederation not only included the areas on both sides of the Rhine within its scope, but also included Bayern, Baden, Württemberg, and Hessen. Almost one-third of Germany's land was occupied. Under the pressure of Napoleon's power, Prussia had no power to resist. The crisis of the Germanic nation at that time was no different from that of China today. However, after the efforts and calls of Arndt, Fichte, Jahn, and others, the German people's national consciousness gradually awakened, and they realized the necessity of unity. Therefore, there was the victory of the Wars of Liberation and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Later, after Bismarck's efforts to strengthen unity, such as the success of unifying North Germany and the Customs Union, there was the victory of the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. What lessons can we learn from this? It is that if Germany had not had the loud calls of Arndt, Fichte, and Jahn, the German people might not have awakened and united so quickly. Without the unity at that time, there would not have been the victory of the Wars of Liberation and the war against Austria. Without Bismarck's success in unifying North Germany and the Customs Union, there would not have been the victory of the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. Dear students, historical facts tell us that when a country is in a time of crisis and does not want to perish, there is indeed no second way to save the country other than unity. This is true for a country, and on a smaller scale, student groups must also be united in order to have a glorious future. Overseas students are intellectuals who have received higher education. Now that they are in a foreign land, they are more deeply stimulated than ordinary citizens. Therefore, they should be the first to implement and guide this effort for unity. The association has been established for three years. During these three years, especially in the last year, it can be said that there have been no significant achievements. In this solemn opening ceremony, I hope that everyone will follow the purpose stated in our founding manifesto, to learn from each other and connect emotionally, and move towards the goal of victory on the road to national salvation through unity.</p>

<p>In the past, provinces and cities directly selected and sent students who were deemed qualified for overseas study by the provincial and municipal education departments. The Ministry of Education only made an endorsement on the report. Since the Ministry of Education stipulated the re-examination method in the 22nd year, students selected by various provinces and cities must undergo a re-examination by the Ministry of Education. If the re-examination results were not good, they would not be allowed to study abroad. In the 23rd year, the re-examination was changed to review, but it was difficult to leave the country if the review deemed that the results were not good. This is the general situation of the Ministry of Education's serious handling of the selection of overseas students by various provinces and cities in recent years. According to investigations, a total of 79 overseas students were admitted by national agencies in the 23rd year, including 21 from the education departments of Jiangsu (2), Anhui (3), Hunan (3), Hubei (2), Shanxi (re-examination not admitted), Chahar (2), Guangxi (4), and Guangdong (5) provinces (hereinafter, education departments will be abbreviated as departments), 30 from the China-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees (hereinafter abbreviated as the Fund Board), 4 from the National Tsinghua University (hereinafter abbreviated as Tsinghua University), and 4 from the National Central Research Institute and other agencies (hereinafter abbreviated as the Research Institute and others). The departments are listed below by discipline:</p>

<p>Temporary Applications for Eligibility Review are also Accepted</p>
<p>The original deadline for registration for the general examination in this city was September 30th. The initial deadline for applying for eligibility review was September 20th, but was later extended to September 30th. The Education Bureau has published announcements in the newspaper. Now, because there are still many people from afar requesting application forms and review documents by mail, it is estimated that the delivery and receipt of mail and the search for documents will take time, and the procedures cannot be completed within the limited time. The applicants have also requested an extension of the deadline. It is specially approved to extend the deadline for registration and application for eligibility review by nine days from October 1st to the 9th to facilitate the processing. As for the admission tickets that candidates should receive, they will be issued before the examination date. The date of issuance will be announced in the newspaper at that time. If candidates from afar come to apply by train or ship and request a fare reduction, a public announcement will be made after the methods are agreed upon.</p>

<p>To be held in Shanghai on October 3rd and 4th. Invitations sent to students in elementary, middle, and high schools.</p>
<p>The Chinese Animal Protection Society has decided to hold an essay and drawing exhibition on October 4th, World Animal Day, to promote ideas of benevolence. Yesterday, the society sent letters to various schools in the city, urging students to actively participate and contribute to this worthy cause. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Schools: The society's letter to various schools in the city stated, "Greetings. October 4th is World Animal Day, consistently observed in Europe and America. Its purpose aligns with the ancient Chinese philosophers' concept of treating all creatures and people with benevolence. However, in recent times, traditional virtues have been neglected and are gradually fading away, which is regrettable. With this year's Animal Day approaching, our society, to promote the spirit of benevolence, has decided to hold an essay and drawing exhibition for students in various schools in the city to promote this idea. We have long admired your school's effective teaching methods and outstanding achievements, particularly your emphasis on improving students' psychological habits. We are especially impressed by this.

<h3 id="e145">On the Wharf of the Sanitation Company <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>After exchanging the bill of lading for cash at the accounting office of the Guangzhou Sanitation Company, the farmer Cao Jin came out. The Pearl River returned from the distant sea, flashing dazzling golden light, carrying the most urgent tune, turning up the floating yellow mud from the bottom of the river,挟着 various shells and animals, discolored seaweed, and waste discarded by humans, flowing back into the vast fields. It was like a pure gold, huge, and poisonous snake. Its whole body was bulging, and bubbles were emerging from every small pore on its snake skin. The river surface within fifteen miles was filled with the salty morning sea breeze, vigorous, making the people of Guangzhou more courageous than yesterday.</p>
<p>Shamian floated on the riverbank like a mud turtle, its back covered with green moss from distant years. The gray tiled houses on both banks faced each other from afar, and towering above them were the stone buildings of the customs house. The customs house clock chimed with a heavy, leisurely metallic sound, and the whistle of the steamship in the river was like the cries of a child. The bricks and mud in front of the embankments on both sides were the first to get wet, and soon they were completely submerged in the water.</p>
<p>Here, on the opposite bank, in the river, accompanied by various sounds, Guangzhou's daily song of labor began. It seemed to be like this:</p>
<p>"Yesterday has passed, follow us...</p>
<p>Today, we are building a happy place without deception in the whole world,</p>
<p>Follow us!"</p>
<p>Cao Jin's younger brother, Cao Hai, was sitting on a dung boat. As soon as he saw his brother, he stood up swaying at the stern of the boat. The small boat was tied under the wharf at the front, impacted by the river water, resolutely using its pointed head to emerge towards the shore.</p>
<p>They spoke in excessively loud voices:</p>
<p>"How many loads did you buy?" the person on the boat asked.</p>
<p>"A total of twenty-five loads," the kind brother replied, gesturing with his hands.</p>
<p>"A lot!"</p>
<p>"Not much!"</p>
<p>"Can you handle it?"</p>
<p>"You want to slack off again!"</p>
<p>The person on the boat saw his brother's satisfied and happy face, so he said nothing and sat down again at the stern of the boat.</p>
<p>Cao Jin sat on a large rock on the bank, surrounded by a wide mudflat. He used a piece of broken tile to draw ridges of fields under his feet, writing words like "bumper harvest of five grains" or "peace for people and livestock" in each grid. The gray-white red hair cement road leading from the Sanitation Company's dung wharf to the pier reflected the strong sunlight on his forehead.</p>
<p>Sun Yongchang, the Sanitation Company's accountant, walked towards the farmer with gecko-like steps. He was a greedy idler, around forty years old, and his extremely wrinkled face made people suspect that he was constantly taking some kind of bitter medicine.</p>
<p>As he walked, he thought: "Tenants are all stupid animals—but why can money be made from them? Hmph, idiots! When they take out the money, they always pretend to be reluctant and stingy, but in the end, they always take out the cash without adding or subtracting!"</p>
<p>He asked Cao Jin with great contempt:</p>
<p>"Have you corrected your thinking?"</p>
<p>"What thinking of mine?"</p>
<p>"Ai—!" His voice rose from low to high, with an unnatural tremor. "Don't you often say? You say: the government doesn't care about anything!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Isn't it?"</p>
<p>Cao Jin said, looking at Sun Yongchang warily. That face had nothing but wrinkles, but it seemed to reveal a kind of aura—which was common among Guangzhou's tax merchants and donation thugs, who thought they were managing the taxpayers for the government. Sun Yongchang swept his bitter eyes over the rolling Pearl River, where small boats carrying various goods crawled like ants. If he wanted to teach the stupid farmer Cao Jin, he thought this was the perfect time.</p>
<p>"How can you say that, my dung brother?"</p>
<p>"Just talk about the price of fertilizer, please don't blame me," Cao Jin replied humbly, not prepared to anger the accountant Sun Yongchang. "You raised the price, and it's still your own decision."</p>
<p>"But you're talking nonsense. Why is raising the fertilizer price our own decision? No one can do anything the government doesn't allow."</p>
<p>Sun Yongchang stared at the pier, where many small boats were pushed and squeezed by the river water, creaking loudly. Idle boatmen curled up their feet and dozed off in the sunlight, Cao Jin stretched out his fingers and calculated:</p>
<p>"One three-fen-six (Guangdong currency, five cents in silver)... another three-fen-six... Uncle Chang, I'm not complaining to you, how much is a load of manure worth—how can we bear such a price increase? It seems that the government listens to you very much. If you manage us—things will naturally not go well."</p>
<p>"Good stuff! Good stuff! You'll rebel soon! I dare to bet."</p>
<p>Accountant Sun Yongchang left Cao Jin, leaving the honest tenant alone on a tile and mud square bisected by a red cement path, and walked to the shore himself. The Pearl River roared unhappily, and a huge sound of the tide biting the shore came from somewhere. It shook its golden, shimmering body, warning Sun Yongchang, roaring like a beast, telling him not to get close to it.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't Sun Yongchang let himself please others?——While the accountant was walking by the pier, scolding the boatmen one by one, Cao Jin was thinking about such questions. People could assume that Sun Yongchang was a clumsy businessman who didn't know how to do business. Many customers came from the countryside with cash to the provincial capital to buy fertilizer that others thought was just waste—what kind of business was this? But Sun Yongchang didn't like any of his customers. As if this was also a funny thing, Cao Jin smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>After Sun Yongchang had expressed his hatred for the boatmen (which was actually like his dissatisfaction with all of humanity), he turned back to Cao Jin and said:</p>
<p>"You are a silly bird! You've been poisoned by your brother—will he have a good death! Everything in the world is managed by someone, and the government manages everyone. This wharf, these boats, these bastards, don't they all need to be managed well? If everyone messes up, what will this world become!"</p>
<p>There was a person Cao Jin had to find at the Sanitation Company's wharf, he was the wharf gangster Big Snake Head Wang Deshan. This person managed five wharves according to a kind of habit. They were arranged one after another along the Pearl River, standing, staring blankly at the ever-drying river center, as if they themselves were slowly sinking day by day. Their wooden feet were gnawed and rubbed, growing slippery green moss, but some feet were exceptionally thin, as if the flesh above had already been removed, leaving delicate, almost broken bone tubes.</p>
<p>Wang Deshan divided the ruling power of these five wharves with the Guangzhou Municipal Government with his powerful influence. The porters above could only get work under his orders, and no goods could be shipped without his consent.</p>
<p>"Bring the money..." He said to the cargo owner. After getting the money, he shouted loudly to his subordinates: "Come two people! Are you all dead!" This rude and careless Big Snake Head often only said such words, and after ordering, he ran away. He didn't care about things, and didn't know who he should thank—this "person" gave him power, territory, and subjects.</p>
<p>Cao Jin was looking everywhere on the Sanitation Company's wharf. There were no goods or buildings blocking his view here, just a flat black earth by the river. There was no Wang Deshan, nor a porter. He turned into the Sanitation Company's accounting room.</p>
<p>"Why aren't the goods being shipped yet?" the accountant Sun Yongchang asked.</p>
<p>Cao Jin pointed to the glass window and replied,</p>
<p>"Look, it's quiet outside... Do the goods have feet themselves?"</p>
<p>Sun Yongchang suggested that if he could give him six cents, then he would allow him to ship the goods himself in the name of the accounting room. What kind of nonsense could Wang Deshan negotiate with the accounting room.</p>
<p>"This is an illegal thing!" Cao Jin said. But he gladly accepted Sun Yongchang's proposal. In this way, that unfortunate day began with the thing that the wharf people called "stealing."</p>
<p>When the two brothers started to remove the twenty-five loads of manure, Big Snake Head Wang Deshan came from the rice wharf with eight brothers. "That's Cao Jin!" He jumped up and ran over, and everyone followed him. They started to beat the two brothers—the two farmers who were easily fooled anywhere. The younger brother Cao Hai was the first to be knocked unconscious and thrown unconscious on his own small boat. The older brother Cao Jin had a rib broken by a bamboo pole, crawled under the glass window of the accounting room, and lay there groaning. Accountant Sun Yongchang walked slowly to the window with the satisfying feeling of walking out of the theater. A ghostly human head immediately appeared on the window. He raised his hand inside and tapped on the glass of the window, tapped a few times and then tapped a few times, trying to call Cao Jin, who was seriously injured and lying under the eaves outside the room, to open his eyes. He saw Cao Jin open his mouth wide, his face losing color due to pain, trembling all over, but he couldn't hear him shouting anything.</p>
<p>Cao Jin opened his eyes, but couldn't see anything, so he moved his head numbly from side to side.</p>
<p>"Your luck is really bad, poor fool! Why did you... wait until Big Snake Head came back to ship the goods... Not too late, not too early, he came just in time—you really have no luck! …Hey, how are you now? Can't stand up and walk? Then what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Constantly knocking on the glass window inside, Accountant Sun Yongchang repeatedly said the above words to the "thief" outside who was gradually losing consciousness.</p>

<h3 id="e148">It's Orange and Tangerine Season Again <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>"Remember the best scenery of the year, it's orange and tangerine season again."</p>
<p>Now the domestic oranges and tangerines are about to ripen. According to Han Yanzhi's Citrus Spectrum in the Song Dynasty, there are true tangerines, branch-grown tangerines, sea red tangerines, Dongting tangerines, sweet tangerines, wood tangerines, vermilion tangerines, and steamed bun tangerines. Oranges include yellow oranges, vermilion oranges, green oranges, milk oranges, collapsed oranges, sand oranges, wrapped oranges, cotton oranges, early yellow oranges, and lychee oranges. Nowadays, people generally only know that tangerines include the edible Shantou ponkan and snow tangerine, Xiamen banana tangerine, and the inedible stinky-skin tangerine; oranges are named after their place of origin, such as Guangzhou orange, Dongting orange, and Huangyan honey orange. The Citrus Spectrum says, "Tangerines and oranges come from Suzhou, Taizhou, west from Jingzhou, south from Yue, Guang, and Fuzhou, but those from Wenzhou are the best." As far as I personally see, Wenzhou oranges contain a bitter taste, and although they are said to be sweet in bitterness, they may not be considered top quality. Li Shizhen's Herbal Compendium says: "Tangerines are southern fruits, and they are abundant in Min, Guang, Wen, Tai, Su, and Fuzhou, and Jingzhou. Although they exist in Sichuan, they are not as good." That's right, tangerines and oranges are southern fruits. The northern climate is cold and not suitable for tangerines and oranges. Even if they are planted, they will mutate. Broadly speaking, the north and south of our country are divided by the Huai River in terms of soil and climate. It is not suitable to plant oranges north of the Huai River, so the ancients had the saying "an orange becomes a trifoliate orange when it crosses the Huai River." The further south you go, the sweeter the oranges become, so Guangzhou oranges can be considered the king of oranges in our country. Of course, the warm climate in Guangdong plays a big role in this.</p>
<p>Chinese loquats and oranges mostly ripen and are picked in the late autumn and winter. Once spring arrives, oranges will rot. Traditional methods of storage can only preserve the outside appearance, and the inside is either dry and shriveled or moldy, which is exactly what is meant by "golden and jade on the outside, rotten cotton on the inside." It is not easy to find good oranges to eat between spring and summer. Since the opening of the seas, American oranges have been imported, so you don't have to worry about not having oranges to eat all year round as long as you live in a major city and have money. However, in Europe and the United States, some people have already found them too expensive and can't afford to eat them, so they eat tomatoes instead, so tomatoes are called "poor man's oranges." There is also a saying: "A home with tomatoes has no sick people." It turns out that tomatoes are the most vitamin-rich fruit, especially vitamin A, which is eight times more abundant than oranges. Therefore, tomatoes are regarded as an indispensable nourishing food in European and American countries, equivalent to oranges, and the output is large and the price is low, which is more cost-effective than eating oranges. Tomatoes have been imported into our country for only about forty or fifty years, which is comparable to the import of American oranges. Not many people plant them, and few people like to eat them. Because of the scarcity, they are sometimes more expensive than oranges. Only in summer and autumn, when the output is higher, are they cheaper. I don't know about other places, but in Shanghai, the market price of tomatoes and American oranges is roughly the same. I have suffered from stomach problems for twenty years, and my wife has also had intestinal problems for several years. Her intestines were operated on, and it has been three years now, and she still cannot eat hard rice. Now, both she and I have to eat oranges every day, and she also needs to drink tomato soup. These two things have become our daily necessities, and also luxuries. For the past three years, we have felt that these two things are a huge expense.</p>
<p>My wife's intestinal disease, according to the doctor, "is a severe form of tuberculosis, and this section of the intestine must be removed." My wife did not dare to take the risk, and I could not force her. The doctor initially said that she could only live for half a year, and after half a year passed, he said that she could only live for one year. Now that three years have passed, the doctor says, "Her resistance is particularly strong, and she is well-cared for." Alas! Living in a home like ours, can we say that she is well-cared for? Dragging a large group of wild horse-like children, living in a cramped alley house in a big city, where sunlight is not enough and the air is not fresh enough, chicken soup cannot be eaten every day, and nutritious food relies only on oranges and tomatoes, and we often worry about the lack of them. However, she is able to eat these two things often, which seems to have had a great effect, so she is still alive today, which is a stroke of luck. Recently, I read the 126th issue of the Chinese Medical Journal, and saw Hou Xiangchuan's article "The Relationship between Vitamin C and Disease," which said:</p>
<p>Clausen, S.W., has elaborated on the close relationship between vitamin C deficiency in guinea pigs and tuberculosis. Although the results obtained by most researchers are not very similar, most of them have reduced the symptoms of tuberculosis patients by injecting vitamin C. McConkey M. and Smith, D.t. reported the results of their research, using seventy-two adult guinea pigs, feeding them with the sputum of tuberculosis patients every day, for six weeks to four months, of which twenty-seven guinea pigs suffered from intestinal tuberculosis due to a slight deficiency of vitamin C. The remaining guinea pigs were fed the same food, with an adequate amount of vitamin C added, and only two suffered from intestinal tuberculosis. It can be concluded that vitamin C has the effect of protecting guinea pigs from tuberculosis. Schagan, B., has stated that when there is a lack of vitamin C, there will be more cases of scurvy, and cases of tuberculosis will also increase at the same time.</p>
<p>Mr. Hou also has an article "Vitamin C in Chinese Citrus and its Processed Products," which says that he used chemical and biological methods to measure the juice of forty kinds of citrus fruits, and proved that the vitamin C content of Shatin pomelo and grapefruit is the highest, followed by snow tangerine, then various grapefruits, and various oranges, and the lowest is Taizhou honey orange, local orange, and Huangyan and Quantai Mountain honey orange. He also believes that Shantou honey orange (also known as ponkan) has the same ability to resist scurvy as American oranges. And Guangzhou orange or Shantou snow tangerine is even better than American oranges. Since oranges are the fruit with the most vitamin C, and whether a person lacks vitamin C is closely related to scurvy and tuberculosis, which has been scientifically proven. Then, my wife, who is suffering from intestinal tuberculosis, has arrived at this time of oranges and tangerines, shouldn't she be happy?</p>
<p>(Written on September 27, 1936. The title is "More on Oranges." An article "On Oranges" was published in Shen Bao's Free Talk.)</p>
<h3 id="e149">Night Market Portraits <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Simu</p>
<p>As the colorful, fiery flames of neon lights begin to burn, flickering, flowing, swirling, appearing and disappearing, chasing, leaping, the various "night shops" lining the sidewalks create a "vaudeville" of the metropolis, and the show begins.</p>
<p>Hesitantly, slowly moving—no, a mass of people pushing, shoving, squeezing, and crowding, the audience, stares at one stall after another.</p>
<p>The clatter of wooden clogs is buried in the surging torrent of hawking cries, in the eddies of popular songs from the radio. The vivid colors of women's kimonos and makeup, like the lights, dazzle and pierce the eyes. The old, shiny black uniforms of university students, and the foreign-style light-colored cheongsams of Chinese female students also weave through the dance of color and light.</p>
<p>Cloth stalls, clothing stalls, used goods stalls, book stalls, toy stalls, "roasted cuttlefish" tents, flower girls without stalls—the "night market" can satisfy all the large and small needs indispensable to urban life, and even create new needs for you.</p>
<p>"Memory booster! Memory booster!..." A small, mustached man with gleaming eyes splashes spittle as he advertises, his stall also displaying a sign that reads "Recommended by Dr. So-and-so, Professor So-and-so."</p>
<p>A few steps away, a female stall vendor is busy tearing and washing old socks, muttering to herself. It turns out she is selling something called "no-thread" sock-mending paste.</p>
<p>With a "crack," the vendor selling "garden clogs" (low clogs worn in the yard), in a showy manner, desperately throws his goods to the ground. A small woman in Western clothes, who has just walked by, is startled and mutters under her breath, "What an idiot!"</p>
<p>Surrounded by many people, a man selling saws is sawing wood with all his might. There are already quite a few pieces of sawn wood and sawdust. The smiling audience seems to pay the most attention to the large, soybean-sized, stinking sweat on his dirty forehead and bare black arms.</p>
<p>The gaps in the night market are filled by a group of "freelancers."</p>
<p>Six or seven "street portrait artists" (excuse my use of such a realistic term!) stand in a row on the side of the department store, soliciting business, displaying their various signs—no, their works of art—which all seem to have a bit of a caricature flavor. Their own thin, pale, bony faces, paired with hair that looks like a handful of straw, or overly large black glasses that have slipped down to the tips of their noses, a French-style torn hat tilted on their heads, or a maroon-colored Turkish fez, and the inspired gaze and gestures they use when capturing the models and customers they have caught and painting on the spot—all of this constitutes an excellent living caricature. It is not they themselves who are being satirized, but they themselves are satirizing.</p>
<p>Adjacent to them are several fortune-telling stalls, with refined, scholarly-style vendors wearing black outer robes, and paper lanterns on their tables decorated with trigrams and lit candles, imprinting a "historical anachronism" on this modern metropolitan night. However, the person who is intently holding out his palm to be examined by a tall, elegant old fortune-teller happens to be a young man in a university student uniform. This symbol seems even more meaningful.</p>
<p>A mummy-like beggar standing on the remaining one leg, a capitalist among beggars sitting in a two-wheeled cart wearing a copper gong hat that obscures his eyes and nose, and a yellow dog kneeling in front of him with a money basket hanging around his neck—these essential but insignificant characters in this urban "new vaudeville"—have also made their appearance. When they reach this corner, the pedestrians' feet stop for a moment, but they are not looking at the beggars, but at the begging dog. These few lowest-level "freelancers" are inserted precisely between the street artists and the street metaphysicians, and perhaps someone will suddenly have the whimsical idea that this also symbolizes their mutual destined connection?</p>
<p>The flames of the neon lights burn more fiercely, and the movements of the pedestrian audience become more sluggish. That is precisely the moment when the street theater is "full." Famous stars of the play, put forth a little more effort before you starve!</p>
<p>Tomorrow there will be another night market; but tomorrow—who knows about tomorrow!</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Story of Confucius Being Deprived of Food <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Jieren</p>
<p>I once talked about an interesting story in a newspaper supplement, which roughly said:</p>
<p>When Confucius was deprived of food in Chen, he took his two disciples, Yan Hui and Zhong You, to the street one day and saw a shop selling yuanxiao (sweet dumplings), with a sign saying: "Sweet bean paste filled yuanxiao, one for one 'wen' (ancient Chinese coin)." Confucius asked Yan Hui if he had any money. Yan Hui replied, "I never have any money." He then asked Zhong You, who said, "I only have one 'wen'." Confucius said, "That's how we can do it!" So he took out a pen from his pocket and added a stroke to the "one" character on the sign, turning it into a "ten" character.</p>
<p>The three of them swaggered in and ate ten yuanxiao in total. Zhong You took out his one 'wen' and threw it on the table. The waiter asked, "Is this a small account?" They angrily said, "Is there a small account for eating snacks!" Of course, the waiter did not admit that this was the price of the yuanxiao, so they started arguing. Confucius told them to bring the sign in to see, and sure enough, "one 'wen' for one" had become "one 'wen' for ten." The yuanxiao shop owner apologized and said, "Fortunately, you met us today, because we scholars do things with conscience and reason. Otherwise, if you added a stroke above the head of the 'ten' character, it would be even worse."</p>
<p>This resolved the matter. As they were leaving, Confucius solemnly said to the yuanxiao shop owner, "Fortunately, you met us today, because we scholars do things with conscience and reason. Otherwise, if you added a stroke above the head of the 'ten' character, it would be even worse."</p>
<p>Regardless of the truth of the story, this is an excellent satire. Defrauding someone else of their yuanxiao and still saying that it is "with conscience and reason," isn't that a portrayal of a certain type of person? However, they only resorted to that fraudulent means because they were too poor to eat. This kind of thing is also very common. Don't you see university students becoming robbers and thieves?</p>
<p>When a person is threatened by material things, it will force them to disregard propriety, justice, integrity, and shame, and do things that they would not otherwise be willing to do. The instinct to survive is the innate ability of humans and all animals. If you prevent them from continuing to survive, they will naturally struggle to seek the continuation of their survival. If they were not so poor, they would not have cheated others out of their yuanxiao to eat. Everyone has some self-esteem. It's just like when they cheated others out of their yuanxiao, they still covered it up by saying that it was "with conscience and reason." A thief would never be willing to do that when people are starving.</p>
<p>How to enable everyone to continue their survival is a very important issue. This issue must be resolved. Talking about anything else while ignoring this issue is in vain. But it requires everyone's continuous efforts. It is not an impossible thing. Hasn't one place already completed this difficult task? And by then, Confucius would definitely not cheat others out of their yuanxiao to eat.</p>

<p>— Xiangshan</p>
<p>When I was very close to Wusong, I saw the yellow sea current; here I smelled the breath of the mainland.</p>
<p>In the welcome song, the ship slowly docked, and at this time the people on the pier who came to meet us raised their hats and handkerchiefs; excited and nervous.</p>
<p>Outside the ship, it was drizzling.</p>
<p>When the ship lowered the gangplank, countless porters surged in. In the clamor of these porters, I felt a kind of intimacy. This intimacy was the intimacy of the native language of my homeland.</p>
<p>The language is full of richness and warmth, and it contains the golden stories of my childhood. In my teens of travel life; I haven't heard the language of my hometown for a long time. Northern language, even foreign languages ​​- in these emotionless languages, I feel lonely and lonely; but today I hear the same language as my hometown spoken from the mouths of the porters, and the attachment and intimacy that I feel are difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Ah! This language is telling the golden dream of childhood in the midst of vastness.</p>
<p>Poor myself, how long will I be able to immerse myself in this local language? When the sky is cloudless in September, won't I be returning to a foreign country? Won't I be leaving this lovely language again? Not only will I not be able to hear the sound of this language, but I will even have to suppress the sound of its utterance and use another language?</p>
<p>In the drizzle, I waited for my luggage to be transported out of the cabin, and on the other hand, I seemed to be absorbed in the rhythm of the native language, which sounded like a oriole singing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw people's sentiment gradually becoming panicked. The market was covered in dark clouds, the atmosphere was extremely tense, swords were drawn and bows were bent, rumors arose, and they prevailed, transactions were quite lively, but the transactions of large investors were ultimately not as extremely prosperous as in 1931 and 1932, because the selling of the financial community was ultimately not as prosperous as in the past. In the future, the trading situation seemed to have reached the previous and subsequent stages. If it does not advance, it will retreat. If either party softens slightly, the rebound will be significant; otherwise, it will be difficult to say. Yesterday's situation was that at the opening in the morning, selling was the strongest. Large numbers of No. 4, No. 5, No. 10, and No. 11 were sold off. Although there were occasional buybacks, selling was still the majority, especially the selling of No. 11 was the most lively. The market price fell again, suddenly by half a yuan to about one yuan. People's confidence was diminished, and they were quite panicked. In the second session, No. 375 turned from buying to selling, and the market atmosphere felt heavily pressured. Retail investors also sold off one after another, falling another 0.12 to 0.45 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors were rampant in the local area, and short sellers gloated over the disaster, not hesitating to exaggerate. The market atmosphere was even more discouraged. No. 10 and No. 11 frantically sold off, even more so than before. The decline intensified, with the two falling sharply by 0.9 yuan, and the rest also falling by 0.45 to 0.75 yuan. At closing, it was rumored that diplomatic channels were not exhausted and that there was a trend toward normalcy. People's sentiment turned stable. No. 4 and No. 11 saw more buying than selling, and No. 47 also saw buying. No. 31 suddenly had a large number of short covering, so although the previous ones continued to fall by 0.12 to 0.65 yuan, the latter ones suddenly turned to rise. This month's Class B was raised by No. 31 by as much as 0.7 yuan. However, the long-term Class A was still weak. If the news is not widespread, people will inevitably be confused again. The market price resulted in Class E this month falling the most by 1.85 yuan, and Class B this month falling the least by 1 yuan. Today's market conditions must be extremely chaotic. The total number of transactions was about 16 million yuan. The result of its rise and fall is compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e156">Yarn and Cloth: The Yarn Market Suddenly Sees a Miserable Fall; The Environment is Poor, and Long Positions Turn to Selling; Each Month Falls by a Huge 3-4 Yuan <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising for days, suddenly reported a miserable fall yesterday. This situation is entirely due to the speculation of general speculators. The reason for its sharp decline is that it has risen by 18 yuan compared to the low price. Recently, various parties have purchased yarn, with about 20,000 bales. Customers' appetites seem to be full, so long positions have sold off one after another, and the market has fallen more and more sharply. The exchange's chips for Jin Cheng, Shuang Lu, and Xing Shi brands of yarn fell sharply by 3 to 5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Marked Yarn Market Atmosphere is Extremely Loose and Abusive</p>
<p>The marked yarn pre-market opening saw each month presenting a downward trend, and was also shrouded in a bad atmosphere. People were panicked, and large investors sold off, so the market's chips were loose and abusive. Therefore, the market gradually went downstream, and the falling trend was very strong, because general floating long positions,鉴于the bad situation, were particularly keen on cutting positions, and the market became increasingly unsupported. It was noted that Ming De He Xing Da Chang Cheng Xin Hua and other long positions sold off in large quantities, while Tong Ji Da Feng Da Fu Geng Feng Tai Chang Chang Feng Xin Cheng and other short positions replenished even more. As a result, each month's marked yarn fell by 1.6 to 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere was very fearful after the afternoon opening. Because the securities and gold gangs came to sell off together, the falling trend became even more severe. The second and third sessions were still sluggish. By the time of closing, because the degree of decline was too great, it triggered a slight rebound in covering. As a result, May fell by another 0.7 to 0.9 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that the sell-off included Ming De 3000 bales, He Xing 5050 bales, Sen Kang 3150 bales, Chang Yu 1900 bales, Feng Tai 2000 bales, Wang Tai Xing 2900 bales, Da Chang Cheng 4300 bales, Xin Hua 1350 bales, Yu Da 6000 bales, Ming Hua 1800 bales, Shen Ji 1800 bales. The buy-in included Zheng Ji 2150 bales, Da Fu 1050 bales, Tong Ji 1650 bales, Da Feng 1750 bales, Yuan Da 1650 bales, Geng Feng 4100 bales, Tai Chang 4050 bales, Chang Feng 8050 bales, Bai Cheng 3500 bales, Lan Kang 1350 bales. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Selling Prices Also See a Sharp Fall</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales are still good. It was noted that all gangs bought a total of 1220 bales throughout the day. The selling prices of yarn fell by 2 to 4 yuan. The amounts handled by each gang are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Sellers Swarm in; The Cotton Market Cannot Support <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply due to the yarn market's decline. Moreover, the weather was sunny and right, and the situation of new cotton was excellent. According to people in the industry, the future is estimated to still have a hope of increasing, so some people tended to sell off, and the market turned downward. However, the overseas cotton industry situation is still good.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Falls Sharply by 5-6 Jiao</p>
<p>The marked cotton pre-market opening was due to the continuous rise of American cotton, about 17 pounds in two days. The Osaka Sanpin yarn and cotton rose by one yuan. There was a rumor of a recent squeeze, and long positions shouted very high, rising 0.3-0.4 jiao. When shooting to the long term, it turned lax. Unexpectedly, when the second session opened, the yarn market fell, the selling wind suddenly rose, and the falling trend was very strong, falling sharply by 0.4 to 0.65 jiao. The long term was挫折, and by the third closing, the market state was getting weaker and weaker. In fact, the weather was good, the new cotton production was excellent, and there were still quite a few people who sold off when it rose. It was noted that Ming De Yu Da He Xing Feng Tai Run Kang and other long positions came out in large quantities, while Chang He Hua Mao Sen Kang Tai Chang Yi Chang Yi Kang Yuan Xing Chang and other long positions continued to advance, and short positions covered. As a result, each month's marked cotton fell by 0.25 to 0.45 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, the situation was panicked, and the situation on the table changed sharply. Sellers swarmed in and fell sharply by 0.5 jiao, because most long positions吐出, which caused the market to be unsupported. As a result, each month fell by another 0.25 to 0.3 jiao compared to the morning closing. It was noted that the sell-off included Yu Da 15,000 dan, Ming De 15,900 dan, He Xing 8,500 dan, Geng Feng 8,800 dan, Feng Tai 7,600 dan, Tong He 4,500 dan, Run Kang 3,100 dan, Jin Chang 4,100 dan, Mao Jin Yuan Da 4,400 dan, Da Feng 3,500 dan, Tai Chang 10,100 dan, Yi Chang 3,800 dan, Yi Kang 6,900 dan, Chang He 10,400 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 7,600 dan, Chang Feng 5,500 dan, Xin Cheng 4,300 dan, Shen Chang 5,300 dan, Hua Mao 3,500 dan. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Factories Need Constantly</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still not thin, and factories need it constantly. The sources are Yao flower 6,800 bales, and Tong flower 2,300 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Silk and Tea   Silk Market Also Returns to Stagnation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices showed a slight improvement, but there was still a difference of about 40 yuan compared to the prices held by Shanghai merchants, so there were still few transactions. French firms in particular rarely inquired, and foreign firms' silk sales entered a standstill. On the user side, there was a slight increase in appetite from other ports, but the local market also became sluggish due to the current situation. As a result, the Shanghai silk market, which seemed to be expanding, was momentarily stagnant.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened. Liverpool news was good. Foreign firms, fellow traders, and Wall Street actively bought in. Fabric demand was smooth. Prices for all months rose by seven to ten points. Subsequently, cotton farmers hedged, causing a partial correction. However, cotton farmers, after the price increase, seemed inclined to hoard. The market closed flat and weak. Spot prices rose by eight points, and futures rose by eight to ten points. British cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures rose by seven to eight points. Indian cotton merchants and mainland exporters traded in large quantities. The amounts liquidated by bulls were absorbed. Bengal rose by 1.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 2.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 2 rupees. (Original telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, opening predictions for the first day were: Broach at 221 rupees, up 0.75 rupees; Oomra at 198 rupees, up 0.5 rupees; Bengal at 157 rupees, up 0.25 rupees.</p>

<p>On the first day in Osaka, futures for three brands of yarn rose by 90 sen to 2.10 yen. Near-month contracts were at 215 yen, and far-month contracts were at 207 yen. Cotton futures rose by 80 sen to 1 yen. Near-month contracts were at 67 yen, and far-month contracts were at 66.70 yen.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Fluctuates with the Situation; Credit to the Interior is Already Restricted; Four Major Firms Can Barely Maintain Operations <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market turned weak. Overseas cotton markets were consistently strong and rising. Domestically, due to the tense situation, rumors abounded, causing widespread panic. Yarn and cotton prices fell sharply, leading to a gloomy cloth market. Eastern goods, fine cloth, and fine twill were mostly sold off according to the market. Selling prices varied due to differing opinions, generally falling by 2.5 to 5 fen per piece. However, those with shortages of spot goods still sold at the original prices. British firms like Jardine Matheson and factories producing heavy coarse cloth, due to strong sales across various regions and difficulty in delivering spot goods, again raised prices by 5 fen per piece. Heavy coarse cloth, due to large absorption by the military uniform industry, was in short supply on the market. Factory prices increased, causing market prices to rise sharply. Factories producing printed and finished cloth were arranging for deliveries, keeping the market quiet but firm. Due to the serious situation and financial tightness, loading goods was slightly sluggish. Wholesale firms on this street and credit transactions with interior regions were also strictly restricted.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 3009th auction by Yuan Fang &amp; Co., showcasing four types of goods: Western satin, velvet, wool broadcloth, and silk. Bleached cloth, foreign yarn, poplin, and red foreign gray cloth were not included. The market coincided with the passing of the Autumn Festival, nearing the winter goods season, so customers in the interior had needs to prepare. Auction prices increased more than they decreased. Of the 49 lots of various goods, totaling 79 cases, Western satin including "Xi Hu" brands saw prices rise by 1-2 fen per yard compared to the previous period. Velvet and wool broadcloth did not change much. Silk "An Dian Bao" brand increased by 1.10 yuan per piece. "Cai Ba Shi" rose by 90 sen, the most. "Five Star Three Ding Jia Yan Guo Gong" rose by 50 sen. Others rose by about 30 sen. "Hai Niu Kuai Li" and "Hai Tian Ping Ju" were flat.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Our Factory's Woolens and Fabrics are Exceptionally Popular <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Woolens and fabrics from our factory have been selling briskly in recent days. Local and visiting merchants have been actively purchasing, showing a positive trend. Goods from Xie Xin, Jardine Matheson, and Zhang Hua are mostly in short supply. Selling prices have been increasing from morning till night. In particular, goods from Wuxi Xie Xin Factory are even more popular because their patterns are quickly updated. Yesterday, Xie Xin plaid suiting fabric was being sold at 5.50 yuan, medium-thick serge at 4.50 yuan, and "Five Blessings Arriving" straw-yellow Water Tweed at 3.95 yuan. Jardine Matheson No. 39 heavy serge is almost out of stock in the market, causing prices to jump up by 30 sen, now difficult to obtain for less than 4.70 yuan per yard. Hall and Holtz still sells at 2.85 yuan. Zhang Hua 918 serge rebounded by 5 fen after falling, due to increased sales and continuous production. Riding breeches are wholesaled at 5.65 yuan, and military yellow cloth is at a net price of 2.60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Grains: Wheat Flour Bulls No Longer Intend to Persist <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months fell uniformly. This was because the price of foreign wheat, as reported in Chicago, had fallen by 60-80 sen in a few days, Canada fell by 1 yuan, and Liverpool fell by about 4 pence. Therefore, at the opening, sentiment was already soft. Prices for October through December fell by 20-30 fen. January and beyond remained relatively calm. Later, as bulls gradually exited and rumors about the situation intensified, the situation gradually worsened. By the time of the afternoon opening, due to sluggish actual sales and outside bulls unwilling to strongly persist due to the situation, the market felt sluggish, falling another 10 fen compared to the morning closing. If the situation remains unstable, the market will definitely become sluggish and is likely to soften. March contracts were also auctioned. The initial price was 3.445 yuan, and the closing price was 3.44 yuan, also down 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Wheat Futures Fall Inevitably <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat market, when trading opened in the morning, prices fell uniformly across all months. This was because the price of foreign wheat, during the market closure, fell by 60-80 sen to 1 yuan. Therefore, prices immediately dropped by 20-30 fen. After the second session, near-term contracts showed some stability, while for far-term contracts, buyers exited and prices fell step by step. Trading volume in various months was also brisk. By the time of the afternoon opening, due to the sluggish flour market and many rumors about the situation, prices fell another 40-50 fen. The final difference was as much as 90 fen, and at least 70 fen. This situation was almost entirely driven by sentiment. High-quality wheat prices remain firm, while medium- and lower-quality wheat were soft by 20-30 fen. Shandong and Hebei wheat opened at 5.30 yuan, Guan Dian wheat at 5.30 yuan, second-grade at 5.27 yuan, Ming Guang wheat at 5.25 yuan, Zhu Ma Dian wheat at 5.08 yuan, Wu Hu wheat at 4.95 yuan, and Yuan Hua wheat at 4.93 yuan. Fuxin took 6,000 bags, and Shenda took 2,500 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e165">New Rice Market Rises Significantly <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bian Yuan also rises by 30-40 sen.</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, shipments from various sources totaled 34-35 ships, with a total of over 7,000 piculs. Sales on this street were more active due to a day's closure the day before. Merchants from Qingdao and Dalian also bought 200-300 bags of kiln-grown rice, and dozens of bags of slightly broken rice. Therefore, the new rice market saw an immediate rebound. Prices for new thin rice and thick new japonica rice, such as kiln-grown white rice, all rose by 10-20 sen. New Lu Jian also increased by 15 sen. New Yang Jian was scarce and fragrant, and because prices were relatively low, prices rose even more sharply, reaching as much as 30 sen. Thick and thin broken rice and milled rice were likely to remain flat. New Yin Yuan was tight. Stocks of old Bian Yuan were dwindling, and rice vendors and cake shops favored this rice due to rising prices, causing prices to surge by as much as 30-40 sen.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday and the day before, shipments from various river routes totaled 65-66 ships. Sales of broken japonica, new japonica, old Yang Jian, and various new grades were good. Bian Yuan and thin rice were flat. Market prices for broken japonica and new japonica were stable. Prices for new japonica, new Yang Du Bu Ke Jian, were tight by about 10 sen. Prices for old Yang Jian, thin rice, and kiln-grown rice were slightly firm. Bian Yuan prices were slightly down by 10 sen.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Customers are Inquiring about Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of Ke Xian rice decreased slightly. Because merchants were eager to sell after the holiday, the market was slightly stable. However, local sales were not as active as before the holiday. Although arrivals of brown rice were scarce, merchants from Guangdong were also sluggish. Total trading volume was just over 6,000 bags. However, hoarders, due to the serious situation and the need for food, were inquiring. Therefore, after the price decrease, the market did not weaken. For the whole day, 3,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,258 bags of Hunan rice, and 420 bags of Han brown rice were offered.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Oil and Sesame: New Guider Sesame Oil Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The price opens at 25.20 yuan. Chen Oil crashes, then domestic sales suddenly become active.</p>
<p>Since early last month, when Su Zhou sesame oil was at 23.50 yuan, due to continuous arrivals and sluggish sales, prices fell to 22 yuan. However, because this type of product had been stored for too long, the fragrance diminished and the color changed, making it difficult to sell for a time. Therefore, sellers also relaxed prices and gradually went downstream. By the middle of the month, domestic merchants suddenly became active and took advantage of the situation to buy. Merchants from Hangzhou and Shaoxing bought 500 tins at 22.10 yuan. Since the beginning of this week, purchases have suddenly become enthusiastic. The initial market was still falling, opening at 21.80 yuan, with 1,600 tins transacted. Finally, due to the low price, demand from these merchants remained strong, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. In the previous market, the price had already risen by 40 sen, opening at 22.20 yuan, with 500 tins transacted, still bought by these merchants. Yesterday, these merchants continued to purchase, still purchasing goods from Nansu Zhou and Huaiyuan. Opening at 12 yuan, although the price seemed relatively low, these old goods were slightly different in quality. It was heard that the future market has already been called up to 22.50 yuan. It is learned that this domestic purchase is because the price of vegetable oil there is high, so this old sesame oil is used as a substitute for vegetable oil.</p>
<p>A batch of new Guide sesame oil was heard to have been shipped to Shanghai a few days ago, said to be only 100-200 tins. After arrival, it was cleared, with the price at 25.20 yuan (still calculated at 100 catties using the Sima scale). It was reportedly bought in small quantities. The sellers were unwilling to disclose information, making it difficult for outsiders to understand. New Beng Bu sesame oil is also gradually entering the market, with two or three shipments of 200-300 tins each. The initial market price was 24 yuan and was cleared upon arrival. Yesterday, the original price was still offered, with 200 tins transacted. It is heard that this year's raw material production, except for slightly less in Henan Province, is very abundant. Future arrivals are expected to be continuous.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Foreign Firm Sesame Transactions Quiet <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Foreign firms' sesame market has been quiet near the end of the month. Only traders are handling transactions in the market, and prices have fallen to 11.85 yuan. Currently, there is little development in the foreign situation. It is heard that foreign firms are offering around 11.70 yuan, so the overall situation is difficult to be optimistic about. Transactions of spot raw sesame are still lively, with 8-9 varieties opened at once. Transaction volume is still small, with only over 1,000 bags. Prices are slightly higher by 10-20 sen compared to the previous market. There is talk of a bumper harvest of soybeans, causing sentiment to soften. Fortunately, arrivals are not surging, and local exports and oil factories are inquiring, so prices have not changed much. Yesterday, a total of 5,200 bags of new beans from various routes were opened.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Dried Goods: Longan Market Continues to Decline <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Longan sales have been quieter recently due to the Autumn Festival. Subsequent arrivals are said to be relatively strong, so the market is declining. Trading prices have been chaotic and inconsistent in recent days. Therefore, goods arriving before and after have not been continuously redeemed. However, according to some merchants, due to cost considerations, there is an indication of unwillingness to loosen too much. The future market will depend on how sales go.</p>

<p>Coarse sand and white label prices rise by 10-20 sen.</p>
<p>Although the sugar market experienced slight rumors yesterday, the trend remained firm. The guild's price was 21.65 yuan for spot goods of second-grade coarse sand and white sugar, up by 5 fen; 6.45 yuan for transit goods; 5 fen increase for all eastern white sugar spot goods; 21.45 yuan for No. 4; 21.20 yuan for No. 8; 21 yuan for No. 9; no changes for transit goods; Zhen Ji, a local factory's cotton sugar, rose by 10 sen; 20.50 yuan for No. 1; 20.10 yuan for No. 2; 19.70 yuan for No. 3; 19.30 yuan for No. 4; 18.90 yuan for No. 5; Domestic Hainan red sugar continued to advance. Yesterday, Da Xing offered 600 bags, such as XL mark, NL Zhou mark, and CK Ka, all at 14.50 yuan, up by 10 sen. Nan Duo Pian Qing offered over 100 bags at 10.40 yuan. 143 bags of newly arrived Beihai Pian Qing were offered at 11 yuan, but not sold.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its second tender for Guangdong sugar yesterday. The total amount was 14,607 bags. Tender prices rose by 10-20 sen. Shun De Factory's Wu Yang white sugar, 4,777 bags, were sold at 21.50 yuan. Shi Xin Factory's 2,850 bags were sold at 21.30 yuan, both up by 10 sen. Qu Xi Factory's Gao Shuang 1,750 bags were sold at 21.20 yuan. Second-grade Zhuang, 1,600 bags, were sold at 20.09 yuan, up by 20 sen. Zhong Sha Bai was offered at 19.40 yuan, up by 10 sen, but not sold.</p>

<p>Our doctor has been treating pulmonary tuberculosis and asthma for over a decade. Based on clinical experience, about 19 out of 10 cases can be cured if patients seek treatment at the appropriate time, and we can take responsibility for this. We recognize that the economic limitations of ordinary patients often lead to delays in proper treatment, causing minor illnesses to become serious and beyond remedy. It is truly lamentable. Our doctor has specially established a long-term treatment package fee method to reduce the burden on patients, allowing them to equally enjoy scientific therapy, restore their health, and live long lives. This is what I deeply hope for. If you would like to come, we will treat you with morality. We hope that fellow tuberculosis sufferers will pay attention to this. Consultation hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. House calls are available upon request. Clinic: No. 6, Jun Le Village, west end of Ma Hou Road, Edward Road, British Concession, Shanghai. Telephone: 34524.</p>

<p>Must have a sound mind and superior intelligence.</p>
<p>Regardless of gender, everyone must go through a period of youth in their lives. This period contains great importance. The health and happiness of a person's entire life are closely related. Young men and women! I sincerely hope that you will recognize your responsibilities for the future, must have a healthy body and courageous ambition! Strive to make progress, that is the definition of a good man! Do not take this period of youth lightly, and do not engage in bad habits such as masturbation... which damages the body, damages the nerves, leading to mental depression and forming a neurasthenic patient who is "useless alive and harmless dead"!</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a common illness for young men and women, so it is also known as youth disease. There are thousands of young people in society who are suffering from its poison, groaning in a miserable life. It causes promising young people to transform into pathetic and useless remnants. Life's happiness is completely lost. What a terrible disease!</p>
<p>The symptoms of neurasthenia are generally: feeling dizzy and headache all day, lacking vitality, feeling lost, slow thinking, memory loss, shortsightedness, lack of courage, lack of decisiveness, weak limbs, lower back pain, mental depression, nightmares, indigestion, a haggard face, already showing signs of aging in the prime of life.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is not an incurable disease. If patients pay attention to nutrition, live a regular life, quit the bad habit of masturbation, avoid mental and physical overwork, prohibit stimulating foods, and take "Mi Meier Brain Tonic" (Memory Neurotio), they can restore the vitality of their weakened nerves, become energetic, and the above symptoms will quickly disappear, turning weakness into strength, and regaining the benefits of life.</p>
<p>Young people! You must know that the national crisis deepens day by day. The future national glory, the future national rejuvenation, the future welfare of the country and the nation, this very heavy and difficult burden is placed on your shoulders, everyone must pay attention!</p>
<h3 id="e173">Which Method is Effective in Treating Lung Diseases? <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhao Quan</p>
<p>Those with pulmonary tuberculosis have always been called an incurable disease by the world. But now, because the pathology of tuberculosis has been clarified, and from many practical experiences, it is known that pulmonary tuberculosis is a curable disease. If treated appropriately, it can be completely cured. However, common opinions always regard pulmonary tuberculosis as an incurable chronic disease. This greatly hinders the treatment of this disease. Therefore, all those suffering from tuberculosis should realize that this disease is curable, and must adhere to their determination for treatment. This is the basis of treatment.</p>
<p>So, which method of treating pulmonary tuberculosis is effective? This is a really important question that must be explored. Using strong drugs to kill tuberculosis bacteria (i.e., tuberculosis bacilli) is what most people think of. But based on the facts, tuberculosis bacteria have extremely strong resistance. If a strong drug that can kill this bacteria is taken or injected, I am afraid that the drug will harm the human body before it reaches the bacteria. Therefore, it is extremely foolish for patients to use chemical toxic drugs to kill tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs. There are thousands of lung drugs on the market, competing for sales and claiming to be effective drugs for killing tuberculosis bacteria. This is nothing more than catering to the psychology of patients and achieving their purpose of collecting money. As for the actual effectiveness of these drugs, they only help the patient's digestion and reduce their cough, serving as a supplement to recuperation. If patients mistakenly believe that these drugs are a fundamental treatment, it is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of lung disease treatment, it can be described as extremely chaotic, making people not know which method is best. Therefore, to carry out a tuberculosis eradication movement today, the most important thing is to make the general public thoroughly understand the correct and safe treatment of lung disease, so as to surround the lesion of tuberculosis (i.e., the diseased part of the lung), and wait for the enemy (tuberculosis bacteria) to destroy itself is the best strategy. If you want to achieve this goal, then it all depends on enhancing the patient's own defense function (i.e., what is called resistance), making it stronger is the most reasonable. Because if the human body's defense function is strong, white blood cells can trap tuberculosis bacteria, and connective tissue can be added around the diseased part to build a very strong defense line, so that this bacteria cannot break through the siege and cut off its food supply. Therefore, tuberculosis bacteria lose their activity and die, so that lung disease can be safely cured. Therefore, if we want to fight tuberculosis bacteria, without this natural and strong defense function, it is really not enough to kill it.</p>
<p>If you want lung disease to be cured quickly, you have to use appropriate methods to enhance the body's defense function. This kind of treatment cannot be effective with chemical pharmacies. Only organ therapy can achieve the goal of strong defense function. Patients must truly recognize the shortcut to curing lung disease. Apart from organ therapy, there is no better method. If readers can widely disseminate this correct and safe organ therapy for lung disease, then the victims of tuberculosis can be greatly reduced. For individuals, it is not difficult to get rid of the pain and avoid death.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Effectiveness of Organ Therapy for Lung Disease <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned principles of curing lung disease, German Tiebiya Pharmaceutical Factory used the theories of organ therapy invented by Berthold, Brown-Sequard, and Starling, and used scientific methods to extract the effective ingredients (i.e., hormones) from the fresh lungs and spleens of healthy animals. It is then mixed with various precious medicines that benefit the lungs and nourish the body to create a special oral liquid for treating lung disease, named "Fei Huo" (Phith Weal). It has been used for long-term clinical trials in tuberculosis sanatoriums around the world. "Fei Huo" can indeed revive diseased and weakened lungs, enhance the resistance of living organs, and enhance the phagocytic effect of white blood cells. At the same time, it can encourage the function of all cells and exert the body's natural defense. It can increase connective tissue cells, fill in the defects of the diseased part, and build a fortress-shaped connective tissue wall around the diseased part to make it harden and promote the formation of scars. Completely wrap the evil tuberculosis bacteria, prohibit its activities, and be surrounded by white blood cells, causing it to destroy itself. Therefore, taking this "Fei Huo" can naturally produce antitoxins in the body, increase immunity and antibacterial effects.</p>
<p>Because this agent has the above-mentioned special effects, none of the world's drugs can match the rational and effective organ preparation "Fei Huo". This is recognized by scholars in modern times. Regardless of stages 1, 2, and 3 tuberculosis, chronic cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, night sweats, etc., if other treatments have not been effective, an incredible effect can be obtained within a few days after switching to "Fei Huo". If you can take it with peace of mind for two or three months, you will be cured.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Home Remedies for Menstrual Irregularities <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Female Physician Bai Xiu Zhen</p>
<p>The most common women's diseases are menstrual irregularities, menstrual pain, amenorrhea, etc. Those who suffer from this disease are by no means limited to the disorder of the menstrual period. They must also have a yellow face, thin muscles, mental laziness, back pain, lack of sleep, frequent leucorrhea, often lacking vitality, and hindering pregnancy. In severe cases, they may fall into the state of dry blood tuberculosis. This is a very sad disease. The irregularity of menstruation is not due to blood stasis, but is a manifestation of the dysfunction of the female reproductive function. Once this function is impaired, the endocrine glands throughout the body are also impaired at the same time. As a result, the tissues of the whole body are declining, and the blood is gradually drying up, and the appearance suddenly becomes dull and haggard. The natural health and beauty are not retained, and the disease is trapped in distress.</p>
<p>Menstrual irregularities are the most common disease in gynecology, so menstrual regulating drugs are also indispensable in gynecology. The menstrual regulating drugs sold on the market are mostly strong drugs that contract the uterus. Too much dosage can easily lead to danger. In addition, application to pregnant women often leads to miscarriage, and there are many abuses. The drug "Mei Nu Ning" (Menoyrin) was invented based on the above-mentioned pathological needs. If my female compatriots suffer from the above-mentioned symptoms, if they can take it on time, they will definitely achieve smooth menstruation, eliminate all diseases, and restore health. If healthy girls take it regularly, it can make the body healthier and the appearance more plump. If women take it regularly, they will benefit their children and strengthen their bodies, and their youth will remain forever. It is truly a treasure for women and a good medicine for the family.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Radical Treatment for Asthma and Wheezing <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Lu Zhi Xiang</p>
<p>Asthma is commonly known as wheezing asthma, sputum asthma, etc. As for the reason, although there are many theories, there is no consensus. Generally, it starts from chronic bronchitis, heart disease, and chronic kidney inflammation. In addition, there are many cases of nervous asthma.</p>
<p>Asthma treatment used to be considered extremely difficult to cure radically because there were no perfect medicines. Even clinicians often only temporarily relieve the pain with anesthetics (morphine, opium) when the disease breaks out. However, these anesthetics should not be used frequently, for fear of poisoning. Most of the asthma medicines sold in the market contain anesthetics. Although they can take effect immediately, they have the disadvantage of being addictive.</p>
<p>Here, Dr. Humbert M.B., a German medical doctor, has invented a radical asthma treatment drug based on years of experience and the latest theories. Its name is "Xiao Li Ping" (Holipin), which is an oral tablet. The drug does not contain any toxic substances. Although it is very effective, it has no side effects. It specializes in treating various types of asthma in the elderly and children, and breathing difficulties. It has been praised and adopted by doctors from all over the world. Such as asthma caused by chronic bronchitis, or asthma caused by heart disease, or asthma caused by hay fever, or asthma caused by tuberculosis, or asthma caused by nervousness, or asthma caused by kidney inflammation. In short, no matter what the cause is, no matter whether it is a new disease or a long-term disease, it is effective like a god. If it is taken when the asthma breaks out and is extremely dangerous, it can be effective immediately and has the effect of bringing back the dead. Those who want to carry out radical treatment should take "Xiao Li Ping" continuously for two to three months on weekdays. In general, it can be completely cured and there will be no more suffering from recurrence.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Enemy of Youth: Neurasthenia and Dysfunction of the Reproductive Organs <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Shen Boxiang</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a disease widely recognized nowadays, and it is one of the most common. Generally speaking, it is caused by excessive sexual activity or masturbation, which leads to exhaustion of energy, weakening of nerve function, and severe damage to vitality. This manifests as noticeable symptoms such as a heavy head, dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue, lassitude, memory loss, mental anxiety, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, depression, and restlessness.</p>
<p>However, what I have described above are the general characteristics of neurasthenia. In addition, the reproductive organs are also often unhealthy, and sexual dysfunction is very prominent. It begins with phenomena such as spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation. Furthermore, it progresses to impotence, lack of sperm, and frigidity, resulting in a high degree of reproductive dysfunction.</p>
<p>As a result, patients experience extremely severe mental anguish, suffering all day long. They are depressed, dispirited, and lose strength, thus falling into a state of severe neurasthenia. This depletes their energy and weakens their physical strength, destroying almost all the happiness of youth.</p>
<p>If patients do not receive appropriate treatment, most will eventually develop consumption and lose their lives.</p>
<p>The first step in treating neurasthenia is to avoid overexertion of body and mind, practice sexual moderation, eliminate all bad habits, improve lifestyle habits, avoid spicy and stimulating foods, maintain regular bowel movements, take walks in the countryside, and engage in cold water friction. These are all essential hygiene practices that should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is necessary to take two types of medicines: those that nourish the nerves and those that strengthen the essence and tonify the kidneys. According to clinical experience, "Memory Neuratic" (米美爾補腦汁) is a particularly effective nerve tonic for neurasthenia. "Well Tonic" (還爾童), made from refined testicular essence, is extremely effective for strengthening essence and tonifying the kidneys. All kinds of sexual disorders caused by reproductive dysfunction can be gradually cured after taking this product.</p>
<p>The effectiveness and safety of these two medicines have been proven by doctors worldwide and are highly reputable. Patients who take both medicines simultaneously can surely transform from weak to strong in a very short period, regaining the joy of life.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Effective Method for Quitting Smoking by Oneself <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>At a time when the government is strictly prohibiting smoking, all those who consume addictive substances (such as opium, morphine, and red pills) are eagerly considering quitting. However, many are afraid to take the step, while others attempt to find ways to maintain the habit. The reason for this fear of quitting is that they worry that merely quitting will not eliminate the addiction but will instead lead to other illnesses, causing more suffering, and perhaps even endangering their lives. The terrifying stories circulating about quitting smoking have deeply ingrained themselves in people's minds. Therefore, although smokers may have the will to quit, they lack the courage to do so.</p>
<p>Our hospital has conducted considerable research on methods for quitting smoking. We have observed that smokers often suffer from nerve weakness and endocrine deficiency, leading to the exhaustion of their vital essence and a gradual decline. Thus, those addicted to opium often exhibit symptoms of neurasthenia. To quit smoking, it is essential to first strengthen the nerves. This is the fundamental strategy.</p>
<p>If we base our approach to quitting smoking on the principles outlined above, we can achieve satisfactory results. According to our hospital's clinical experience, those who are determined to quit should begin taking the endocrine preparation "Well Tonic" (還爾童), three tablets three times a day, and the nerve tonic "Memory Neuratic" (米美爾補腦汁), two tablespoons three times a day, starting one month before quitting. During this period, they can continue to smoke as usual. After one month, they must stop smoking completely. This is because at this time, the function of the endocrine system is vigorous, the nerves are strong, and vitality is doubled. The weakened state of the whole body will have been revitalized, and nutrition will be good. Therefore, there will be no pain after stopping smoking; on the contrary, there will be a feeling of comfort and pleasure. After stopping smoking, continue taking "Well Tonic" (還爾童) and "Memory Neuratic" (米美爾補腦汁) for another month before stopping completely. At this point, the addiction will disappear imperceptibly. If symptoms of spermatorrhea occur during the period of quitting smoking, "Fonan" (福郎固精片) can be taken to alleviate this. It can also be used as an auxiliary medicine for quitting smoking. Whether or not there is spermatorrhea, start taking it internally after stopping smoking, taking three tablets before going to bed. This will not only prevent spermatorrhea but will also induce sleep.</p>
<p>Post-smoking conditioning is also important. If there is no proper treatment and nutrition is inadequate, the patient may become thin and mentally disturbed. Such conditioning should not be neglected. Although there are countless conditioning medicines on the market, takers do not know what to choose. A product that is suitable for smokers is like a rare bird's feather. According to clinical experience at our hospital, the most effective medicine is the aforementioned "Memory Neuratic" (米美爾補腦汁), because this medicine can strengthen the nerves, build blood and muscle, and also calm the nerves and relieve pain. Smokers often exhibit symptoms of nerve weakness, mental deficiency, anemia, and emaciation. Taking this medicine for conditioning can have a particularly good effect.</p>
<p>The methods and medications listed above are all derived from experience and have yielded excellent results. Compared with any other methods of quitting, this method is safe and comfortable. Fellow countrymen who want to relieve their suffering, this shortcut has arrived.</p>

<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e179">Celebrating President Chiang's Birthday <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department issued a notice stating that the 29th of this month is President Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday. In order to venerate merit and repay virtue, various regions will hold grand celebrations. Of course, we must also express our congratulations on this grand occasion.</p>
<p>In total, President Chiang Kai-shek has been in power for a full ten years, from the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic to the establishment of the capital in Nanjing. During these short ten years, China has undergone a major historical change. From the establishment of the capital in Nanjing to the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, China's national crisis began to unfold. President Chiang Kai-shek, as the first to face this historical crisis, shouldered an extremely heavy responsibility. Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating President Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday, the only hope of the people for President Chiang Kai-shek is how to shoulder this overly heavy task, overcome this unprecedented national crisis, and save China from this losing game. This is the most essential point.</p>
<p>Today, the people seem to have such a desire: regardless of what form politics takes, we support it. We even support the government asking all people to sacrifice their lives, as long as the government can resolutely shoulder the responsibility of saving the national crisis. Regardless of who it is, we will unite to enthusiastically support them, giving them the most noble position in Chinese history. Regardless of what they were like in the past, as long as they can resolutely shoulder this major responsibility at any time, the people will enthusiastically support them at any time. But this great cause of saving the national crisis is not placed in the distant future, but must be realized immediately. If this can be done, anyone who can step forward to shoulder this responsibility will be the greatest hero in the history of our national rejuvenation. Looking around the country today, the only one who can take on this responsibility without hesitation is President Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, today, as we celebrate President Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, we can only offer this most sublime and sincere hope to President Chiang Kai-shek as the greatest gift that the people can offer.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the entire country of China has reached a crossroads where it will either live or die, without allowing for any hesitation. As Arida of Japan said, China must decide immediately whether to submit or resist and can no longer hesitate. Our neighbors have already decided the fate of our nation for us. Do we not understand? We deeply feel that the disaster of destruction is imminent. Therefore, as we congratulate President Chiang Kai-shek on his birthday, our greatest, most urgent, and only hope is that President Chiang Kai-shek will immediately take on the great responsibility of fighting for the survival of the nation when the country is already unified!</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek once declared that the minimum limit of concession to foreign countries is that if the enemy invades even an inch of our land, we will immediately retaliate. However, today, there is also the reality that the enemy is secretly changing the landscape of China without formally occupying land, such as the much-publicized alliance of the five provinces of North China. Regarding this disguised invasion of territory, we sincerely hope that President Chiang Kai-shek will not relax his vigilance. Finally, let us all shout in unison: Support President Chiang Kai-shek, the only hero of defending against foreign aggression and saving the country today!</p>
<h3 id="e180">Amidst the Sound of Cymbals and Drums <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Heng</p>
<p>Around seven o'clock in the afternoon, the erhu downstairs stopped, and the sound of moving tables and chairs started up again. Based on past experience, I guessed that they were going to play cards again. However, this guess turned out to be wrong - instead, there was a burst of cymbals and drums.</p>
<p>"I won't be able to finish today's article again. See, they're doing 'wu qi' again." Old Li threw down his pen in frustration.</p>
<p>"This is called 'fate determined by heaven.' We have no choice but to play for a while; but it's also good to have some fun on this occasion." I pushed away the manuscript paper and walked to the window.</p>
<p>The house where I live is on the second floor, at the front. The landlord's family lives upstairs. Perhaps because the house is not big enough, they covered the small courtyard with a glass roof, and they eat, receive guests, and play cards</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>down there. As long as we push open the window and lean down, we can get a bird's-eye view of everything.</p>
<p>"Look at these guys, they don't look like monks or Taoists. Maybe they're nuns?" Old Li said, pointing to the shadows of people in the light downstairs.</p>
<p>"No, nuns wouldn't have hair. I think they look more like Taoist priestesses." I said softly. Obviously, they heard Old Li's words. Two tousled heads looked up at us for a moment, then lowered their heads again without expression. Continuing was a series of incomprehensible chants or incantations.</p>
<p>The layout downstairs was also a bit different from usual; a square table was placed facing the door, with a spirit tablet made of yellow paper on the table. Because it was standing upright, I couldn't see what the words were. I guess it was "State Duke Hui ×× State Duke Spirit Tablet." On both sides of the spirit tablet were two white candles, shining with a bright orange light. In the center was a metal incense burner, with three sticks of grass incense inserted in it. Several Taoist priestesses sat around the three sides of the table. Each person held a musical instrument, drums, cymbals, small bells, and wooden fish. The first two only sounded briefly at the beginning and the end. The wooden fish and small bells seemed to be a rhythm, constantly sounding along with the rising and falling chants.</p>
<p>I don't know what sutras they are chanting, and even the landlord who hired them to chant the sutras probably doesn't know either. I tried my best to hear a sentence or two, but I couldn't understand a single character, so I gave up this plan. Anyway, they are "chanting sutras," and that alone will satisfy the host. Any further inquiry would be meddling.</p>
<p>The chanting stopped, and a burst of wailing came from the drum. It seemed to be in the room where the deceased used to live downstairs. The cries seemed to be coming from women, clear and sharp, as if they wanted to break through all spatial barriers and penetrate everyone's heart.</p>
<p>"Listen, the clearest one is probably the landlord's eldest daughter," Old Li said to me, leaning against the wall and listening.</p>
<p>"It's strange, I've never seen them have any sadness or grief at all, how can they wail like this when they cry?" He said after listening for a while.</p>
<p>"Those who take worldly affairs too seriously will be deceived unknowingly," I lit a cigarette and took a puff. "We who pride ourselves on being clever are often fools in their eyes. You only know that crying is an expression of human emotions, but you don't know that crying is also a form of human etiquette. So crying requires us to genuinely have all the necessary conditions, it cannot be faked; their achievements in this area are much better than ours, because they have already made it technical and professional." I said slowly, smoking my cigarette. Old Li shook his head silently, as if to say that my words did not satisfy him.</p>
<p>At this time, the crying had stopped, and a series of high-heeled shoes clattered on the stairs, as if several feet were racing there.</p>
<p>"Look, their performance is over, they are going to start another new trick." I smiled at Old Li, the footsteps had entered the next room.</p>
<p>"Elder sister cried really well." A girl's voice. I guess it was the third child.</p>
<p>"Daddy ah - why didn't you take me with you -" Another voice was imitating. I think this might be the lady in the light purple cheongsam.</p>
<p>"Giggle..." A burst of laughter mixed with teasing and wrestling. I made a face at Old Li.</p>
<p>"This is not your new discovery, you don't need to be ecstatic. Actually, what you said, 'crying has been professionalized,' has long been practiced. There are even people hired to cry in Shanghai, do you know that?" He said unconvincingly. I didn't answer, the sound of cards from next door started up.</p>
<p>"A Jin, go downstairs and watch, call us when it's time to cry," the eldest said.</p>
<p>"I really can't live here anymore, I'm going to move out alone next month if you don't move," Old Li grabbed his hair in frustration.</p>
<p>"Old Li, don't forget that we are 'experiencing life'!" I said to him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Screw it, I don't need this kind of life!"</p>
<p>"Don't raise your voice! Second Miss's 'Su San Starts Her Journey' is on again." I waved my hand to tell him.</p>
<p>"Su San left Hongtong County, came to the street, and did not speak..." Before she finished singing, she was interrupted by the sound of cymbals and drums downstairs.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Alley Scene <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Fei</p>
<p>The children are playing happily in the alley, several people scrambling for a small rubber ball. The sweat on their faces is quickly wiped away with the back of their hands, leaving black streaks on their faces. But they don't care at all. While wiping away sweat, they bravely rush into the battle to grab the ball.</p>
<p>They have no fixed rules for kicking the ball, nor do they have goals. The one who has the ball at their feet the most is the most capable. This person is also quite majestic, kicking the ball and shouting: Come and grab it, come and grab it!</p>
<p>So the rest of the people crowd together and work together to grab the ball. But when the ball is grabbed, that person becomes an isolated hero, and the rest of the people surround them to grab it.</p>
<p>They just keep grabbing and grabbing like this.</p>
<p>Just as they are having a great time grabbing, a voice comes from afar:</p>
<p>"Hey! The Grand Master is coming! Clang! Clang!"</p>
<p>That person is wearing a brand new blue worker's uniform, with three or four paper flags stuck in their back (that is, taken from the incense pot), and they are still chewing something in their mouth, making their speech a little vague.</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong! Xiao Rong!" Some people stood still, while others continued to play.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong walked over; he looked like a general on the stage, imitating the recitative of an actor: "I, Zhao Yun, do not kill unknown soldiers, quickly state your name!"</p>
<p>Seeing that no one was talking to him, he changed his tone and said, trying to strike up a conversation, "Ermao, look at these flags, Dad bought them back, and there are incense pots, and mooncakes, such a big package, and, and..."</p>
<p>"And fart!"</p>
<p>Someone blurted out. That person rushed out fiercely:</p>
<p>"Who said that? You don't even have a fart!"</p>
<p>Everyone stopped fighting for the ball. Someone jumped out:</p>
<p>"I said it, what about it?"</p>
<p>"Ermao, beat him! I have mooncakes, I'll be good to you!" He really took out a mooncake, broke it open, and gave half to Ermao.</p>
<p>Ermao looked at that side and then at this side, he dared not reach out to take it.</p>
<p>That one made a face at him, coldly making a sound from his nose: "Hmph! You dare!" He looked around, with a bit of a question mark, "We have more people!"</p>
<p>"I have mooncakes! I have many, many at home!"</p>
<p>"We don't want to eat mooncakes. We have them too." Someone said in response.</p>
<p>"Yes, we don't want to eat mooncakes, we have them too." Many people responded.</p>
<p>"You only have farts, you eat farts, eat farts! Eat farts! Yum, yum, delicious, a little dog watches me eat!"</p>
<p>"You are the ones who eat farts!" That one angrily threw the ball over, breaking the paper flags on their back.</p>
<p>Tears hung in Xiao Rong's eyes, he wanted to rush over, but he didn't dare. Finally, he said in a trembling voice: "Ermao, hit him! I'll give you mooncakes to eat later."</p>
<p>Ermao looked at that side and then at this side, finally opening his mouth: "Abing, why did you break his flags?"</p>
<p>"None of your business, have you forgotten that he called others to hit you the day before yesterday?"</p>
<p>That one was speechless, but still argued: "Today is all your fault, he didn't provoke you".</p>
<p>"Mooncakes taste good. Did you provoke him the day before yesterday?" He paused, "There's a process, one-on-one fighting, killing people is not punishable, no one is allowed to cry!"</p>
<p>"Okay! One-on-one fighting, whoever helps anyone is a bastard turtle."</p>
<p>"You pay for my flags first, I don't care"!</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you pay for tearing my clothes yesterday"?</p>
<p>"I didn't tear the clothes".</p>
<p>"I didn't tear the flags either, it was the ball!"</p>
<p>"Then you take out the ball, and let me break it too".</p>
<p>"Piss"！</p>
<p>"Ignore him, Abing, let's kick the ball."</p>
<p>So they started talking again.</p>
<p>Ermao looked at that side and then at this side, he leaned against the wall, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong glared at him and said, "I won't be good to you next time, eating mooncakes deceitfully"! He shamed him, pulling a face. Then, as if discovering another path: "Abing, don't be fierce, I'll tell my dad"!</p>
<p>The children all ignored him, having a great time playing. The moon was already hanging in the sky, round and round.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Sagging Bed Frame <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>"You broom star! Husband-killing star! Since you came, the family has been uneasy for a moment. Ali has been sick and in pain. Look, you've sucked him dry, not an ounce of meat left, not an ounce of meat. His flesh has been sucked away by you, look at you, as fat as a pig. You broom star! Husband-killing star!" The father-in-law angrily poked his fingertip hard toward his daughter-in-law's face. The daughter-in-law, who was not even three feet tall and had two yellow snotty noses, rolled to the ground like a watermelon.</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law began to cry with a "woo" sound!</p>
<p>The father-in-law felt for a ruler on the table, raising his brush-like eyebrows: "Hmph! You dare to cry!" It was more effective than an order in the military camp. She wiped her nose and immediately stopped crying. Only then did the father-in-law feel relieved. He turned to look at his only son Ali, lying on the camp bed. The quilt was flat, and one couldn't tell if someone was sleeping there. The head exposed at the opening of the quilt looked like something pickled in a medicinal solution bottle in a hospital, except that the two deeply sunken eyes suddenly coughed violently, spitting out white foam-like phlegm. When his father saw that there were red threads in the phlegm,</p>
<p>"What? Ali, are you spitting blood?" The father was anxious, so anxious that his hands and feet didn't know where to put them, he just stood there fidgeting. He glanced at his daughter-in-law standing next to the wardrobe, looking at him nonchalantly. All his resentment was nowhere to vent. He went up and slapped her face, slapping all the yellow snot in his palm. He was so angry that he grabbed her pigtail and dragged her over, slapping her again, making her stare blankly, not knowing what great crime she had committed.</p>
<p>"You broom star, husband-killing star! Ali is coughing so badly, don't you know to come up and help? But you're just standing there staring. Are you cursing him to die? If he dies, I'll never let you broom star live to go to someone else. You little demon that can't be beaten to death!" With that, he slapped her again, knocking her to the ground.</p>
<p>Ali looked at his father hitting someone, as if he was already used to it. He coughed for a while and calmed down. His eyelids covered his eyes. The father looked at his sleeping son. He kicked his daughter-in-law, who had fallen to the ground like a snail, and wearily lay down on the bed.</p>
<p>In this small courtyard, there was only the dim kerosene lamp accompanying the daughter-in-law on the ground.</p>
<p>"Dad! Dad!" Ali suddenly opened his eyes. "The bed frame is too loose, it hurts my spine."</p>
<p>"Tell A Xiang to hold up the bed frame for you," the father sat up. "A Xiang, you crawl under Ali's bed and hold up the bed frame for him, go, hurry up!"</p>
<p>A Xiang looked at her father-in-law's blazing eyes and dejectedly crawled under Ali's bed.</p>
<p>Only then did the father feel at ease and go to sleep, asking, "How is it now?" His son did not answer him.</p>
<p>The alarm clock on the table rang loudly. But the snoring was louder than it.</p>
<p>"Dad! Dad!" Ali jumped out of bed as if he were crazy: "Dad! Get up, there's a ghost under my bed... a ghost is calling啊!"</p>
<p>The father was also so frightened that he jumped up. The faces of the father and son were all as white as paper. They trembled, sure enough, there was a sound under the bed. Ali clung to his father's waist. The father mustered up his courage, took a "copper coin sword" from the</p>

<p>hook, and took a kerosene lamp, using the sword to open a piece of cloth in front of the bed and looked, there was something there. But when he brought the kerosene lamp closer, it was nothing else but his daughter-in-law sleeping there. He was furious. He dragged her out from under the bed at once. Picking up the ruler, he beat her head and face in a frenzy, without asking why.</p>
<p>"You broom star, husband-killing bone, you want to scare Ali to death吗"……"</p>
<p>A frenzy of beating. He stopped his hand when his arm was sore. A frenzy of scolding. He stopped his mouth when he was tired of scolding.</p>
<p>"You are not allowed to sleep tonight, kneel for me all night. The daughter-in-law knelt down, imitating a wooden chicken, touching the scars all over her face. Only then did the father take his son and sleep on his own bed.</p>
<p>The next day. Ali wanted water to wash his face. His father looked high and low for his daughter-in-law and couldn't find her.</p>

<p>Pear blossoms are pale white, willows are newly green.</p>
<p>Flowers, willows, everything, everything is affectionate.</p>
<p>Partridges are crying, cuckoos are wailing.</p>
<p>Clap, sob, why is it so desolate.</p>
<p>The season is just Qingming, the weather is not clear.</p>
<p>Light smoke curls faintly, sparse rain drizzles.</p>
<p>Leading people to cry, tears melting.</p>
<p>Alas, life is like a dream, a dream is like smoke, smoke is like rain, and you cry with tears.</p>
<p>Together, we drip, drip, drip, drip, commemorating Qingming.</p>
<p>The heart is broken and the soul is broken, the voice stops and the tears do not stop.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 "From Canossa-Ess to Paris" (Continued)</p>
<p>A German trading broker was sitting next to Xu'er, so he volunteered to be Xu'er's translator.</p>
<p>The captain begged God to maintain peace between Germany and France and increase friendship.</p>
<p>Another speaker was a company commander of a German commercial consultant, and his speech was delivered with a somewhat proud and commanding attitude. He said, "The French are just big children, happy, smart, and unable to predict the unexpected. If they can cooperate with the Germans, they can consolidate the national power of the two countries and jointly resist a common enemy." After speaking, the company commander also raised his glass to celebrate France.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the industrialist (company commander) said again with a disgruntled attitude: "France shows us complaints, our Kaiser, for many years, has extended a hand to France in a noble and upright manner, but France pretends not to see it. You will understand in the future that this is not right." Unexpectedly, Xu'er immediately said, "Before expecting the friendship of the French, your country might as well return what it took from them." After these words were spoken, the air became silent.</p>
<p>"Return!" The commercial consultant continued, "We have nothing to return to them, because we didn't take anything. What we are in charge of now was earned through our heroism." But Xu'er continued, "It's like I stole your watch, and then I proposed to be friends with you and forget the past. Even if you are inclined to forgive me, shouldn't I return your watch beforehand?"</p>

<p>Named Zhen. Double name Shi, a gentry from the countryside. Gave birth to a daughter. Name Yinglian, similar to Zhen. Three years old, clever. One day, the scorching sun cast down a nap. Dreaming of that thing. A monk and a Taoist priest both involved. Said that amorous debts descended to the mortal world. Green bead grass on the riverbank. Deeply grateful for Shen Ying's irrigation. Want to repay the kindness, tears embracing foolish heart. A thunderous sound startled the illusion. Seeing a crazy monk holding a daughter in front of the door. And a. A lame Taoist priest approached. Seeing Yinglian crying loudly, Shi Yin, returns to find old friends. That is, Jia Yucun in the letter. He makes a living writing articles. They sip tea and chat. Outside the window. Where does the coughing sound come from. A flower-picking maid has a charming appearance. A smile and a look back, the name is Youqing. Shi Yin, invited Yucun to enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival together. During the banquet, presented some silver. Yucun, rushed to seek fame and fortune the next morning. Just in time for the Lantern Festival night. Shi Yin, lost Yinglian, where to find her. When the fallen flowers fell, the God of Fire arrived. Burned down the house and went to his father-in-law. After two or three years, he realized the heart of becoming a monk. Following the crazy monk and lame Taoist priest. Madam Feng was heartbroken. A knock at the door in the middle of the night. It turned out that the maid, Jiao Xing, was blessed and lucky. Xing Ruiting smiled three times.</p>

<p>Opening "Baoyu's Lament for Qingwen"</p>
<p>A beautiful scene and a good festival are approaching. Hibiscus fills the garden, doubling the sadness. All the beautiful in the past have short lives. It's a pity that she left her soul in illness. The little maid said sadly. Baoyu, tears soaked his clothes. Tonight, respectfully prepare apples, dumplings, and water chestnuts. A wisp of heart incense sent to the Hibiscus Goddess. Sister, your celestial nature in the White Emperor Palace has not faded. Do not refuse affection before the flowers. Sister, since you came into the world at the age of sixteen. Thinking of only five years. Born with ice-like purity. Flower appearance and moon-shaming beauty. It's a pity. Natural intelligence is hated by things. Cuckoos and cranes destroy the beauty, an ancient saying. Feeling heartache for her early death. Where to find her fragrant traces in the future. Heard again, that the coffin was burned, heart aching. Information leaves a hole of affection. I remember. Her smokey eyebrows were once my appreciation. Until today, the jade ring is cold, and I entrust it to be warmed. The remaining joy of the cauldron is still there. The remaining tear stains are still new. Now, with whom to confide in lonely dreams. I feel that, the empty room has no shadow and is zero. At this moment, the dew is heavy and the moon is dark, and the fragrant soul is faint. I hear, the sound of sorrow surrounds the earth, like bees humming. Unexpectedly, the begonia is withered and not what it used to be. Until now, the parrot in front of the window still calls her name. Your life is thin in the yellow earth. Under the red gauze window, you were extremely affectionate. Separation in death and parting in life were predestined. How many people see the good fortune of red faces. Waiting for me, empty door, meditation, and detachment from the world.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Shanghai Grand Theatre Premieres Soviet Film "Ice and Snow" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>"The Daringo Even," a Soviet Linfei Film Company production, premiered today at the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>The story in the film tells about seven Soviet youths who organize an Arctic expedition to Happy Bay in the Arctic Ocean for geological research. Before their departure, the village chief of the Arctic indigenous people was wounded by a polar bear, so they asked them to rescue him. The team leader, Neterenkov, ordered two people to help, and then set off for investigation with another person, while the remaining three stayed in the camp for mutual comfort. After they left, they encountered wind and rain on the way, and became half lost. The people staying in the camp saw that Liu and the other two had not returned for a long time, so they took a plane to search for their tracks. Unfortunately, the plane collided with an iceberg, and they returned without results. The next day, Liu and the other two were still missing. They set off again to search. On the way, Liu and the other two were lost in the wind for too long, and they were exhausted and dying. Just in the nick of time, the Arctic indigenous people tracked them down, and one of those who set off with Liu had died.</p>
<p>The plot of the whole film is unique, tense and intense, and the director's technique is also very smooth. The actions of each actor can create excellent scenes without the audience noticing; the scenery is also completely real-life shooting, extremely realistic. The distribution of actors is appropriate, it is indeed a film worth watching.</p>
