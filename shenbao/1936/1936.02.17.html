<p>— 華</p>
<p>在最近太平洋上的局勢中有幾種情形値得注意第一中　新　大使又有舉行南京會議之說有人以爲雙方關係已漸呈好轉然而侵略者的三原則一再誇揚從未更變甚至冀察問題的解决阻梗重重且有變本加厲增加華北駐軍之說此種絕望之僵局無論何人皆不能遽抱樂觀第二日僞與蘇蒙間的衝突近又接連發生蘇聯在外交上軍事上的堅强態度始終爲對方所顧忌然而這方而的戰爭危機顯然巳較前加深吾人不得不加以深切的注意第三在美國方面羅斯福總統於今年的元旦演說中曾經指斥所謂「刺刀外交」後來參議院外交委員會主席畢德門又抨擊所謂「國際海盜」最近畢氏更直指九國公的中關於中國門戶開放的原則已全被破壊在這種外交上的表示之外美國的軍備費用也大事增加華府條的推翻後太平洋上兩大帝國主義勢力的對立現在已漸有露骨的表示第四英國雖然有事於西方但是議會下院中關於華北情勢的不斷質問可以顯出其焦慮的一斑最近英政府對於新加坡墨爾鉢斐吉島及加拿大四處軍事費用的增加卽是它將以更堅强的立塲過問太平洋時局的先聲</p>
<p>吾人以爲今日中國欲言準備除了內部工作之外對於外面的國際情形亦應密切注意其發展變化的趨向太平洋上有四大列强爲日美英蘇在政治社會制度的根本上日美英三者與蘇聯均爲對立的但在此四者之個別間亦有種種利害的衝突形成種種不同的對立在滿洲事變初時國際間以爲日美英將成一聯合戰綫以日本爲先鋒向蘇聯進攻然而此後情勢的發展證明此種假定全由於幻想中國領土的續被侵略主權的不斷損失使英美與日本之間的矛盾日益顯著現在聯合反蘇聯的幻夢已全成泡影英美與蘇聯雖有根本制度上之衝突但其對於太平洋上局勢之焦慮則是一致的此種利害的一致現在雖尙無造成聯合陣綫之積極性但顯然已產生消極的相互諒解之作用</p>
<p>最近日偽與蘇蒙間的衝突幾等於局部的戰爭然而英美方面的反應是很冷淡的美國的反應是畢德門對於侵略者的强硬攻擊和國會通過陸軍部增加五四三、三四一、○○○圓軍費擴充太平洋上軍事設備的議案英國的反應是議會中關於華北關稅及北寗鐵路利益保障的質問而對於華北日本駐軍加倍之說雙方同時表示了非常的驚訝美國與蘇聯的實際利益衝突本來不大英蘇的對立因素雖較强烈但最近它們在歐洲政治上的諒解在遠東方面一定會有影饗的</p>
<p>吾人以爲對外抗爭之準備軍事力量不足當以外交力量補足之就常理言一個獨立自主的國家亦不能缺少多方面之友人在國際上中國有可以根本諒解的友人有可以權宜利用的友人吾人不能因爲憚於「以夷制夷」之說忽略了這方面從最近太平洋上四角關係的演變吾人應有此種覺悟</p>

<p>— Louis　Fisher賓符譯</p>
<p>殺氣籠罩下的歐局觀察之二</p>
<p>同樣的猶疑不决使法國對東非戰爭煩惱着。因爲法國對於阿比西尼亞發生的車情很少直接的關係，法政府在英意危機中只想保持兩面拉攏的態度。他們兩者是都能用以箝制德國的。當德國弱時，意法的親善並不必要，而意國和南斯拉夫（法國的衛星）間的矛盾也確乎使這困難。加之意大利在巴爾幹又頗想有所企圖。可是當一個復興的德國威脅奧地利和法國時，這些問題便被視爲不重要了。奧國領土的完整，同是法國和意國永久的利益，這樣遂成爲巴黎和羅馬結合的橋樑了。</p>
<p>因此，一九三五年一月，賴伐爾跑到羅馬看墨沙里尼。這决的會晤實是最近歐洲外交史上的一個轉變點。只有黑衣相和賴伐爾知道全部的眞實，他們可不願宣布。但有些事實是可以知道的。他們同意了法國從法意邊境撇退二十萬的守衛軍，而移駐於法國的北部，以防衛德國可能的侵人。這法意協定同時還包含了意南間的諒解，那安全的保障就是意大利從意法邊境撤退的軍隊並不移駐東北部，而開拔到很遠很遠的地方，也許是東非洲。在羅馬談話中，賴伐爾把法營吉阿鐵路（從吉布底（Djibonti）到阿迭斯·阿巴巴）股票二千五百股和兩條狹長地帶（一與里比亞南部相接，一與以里特利亞相接）獻給了墨沙里尼。他同時又以書面宜告放棄一九○六年十二月十三日英法意三國恊約所給予法國在阿比西尼亞的權利。同時，英意在突尼斯遷延不决的劇烈爭執也解决了！！這更使墨沙里尼在非洲和地中海安了心。從多方面看來，無論法國願意不願意，那對阿的侵略簡直就是法國的產兒。</p>
<p>從法意關係的觀點說來，這墨沙里尼與賴伐爾的處置是必要而聰明的。常意阿事件爆發之初，賴伐爾就竭力繼續法意親善的政策。然而，意大利只是在侵佔非洲亳無價値的土地。他們早已把肥壤分割完了。英國爲了一時反法的目標，曾與意火利在海軍問題上合作過，現在，意大利旣和法國，站在一邊，英國自然再不會想到什麼合作了。</p>
<p>常大不列顚對意大利和阿比西尼亞躊躇不决的時候，事情都停滯着。一九三五年五月，倫敦大大地徬徨起來。到六月她决定行動了。爲準備决鬥起見，她於一九三五年六月十八日簽訂了英德海軍協定。結果引起巴黎的一陣震驚。無信無義的“Abbion”（英國的古稱）又來了嗎？當二月三日那天，英國和法國曾在倫敦的定共同努力歐洲的和平工作，特別涉到了德國。在四月的第二個星期中，這兩强叉曾商妥德國的問題。不料從此後，誠如巴黎所說，大不列顚郤背了法國突然地與德國締結了有損於法國的海軍協定，使法國處於針對德國的不利地位。</p>
<p>這一切芥蒂，遂不能誘致法國在意阿事件上去跟英國合作。但英國郤需要這種的合作，而因此堅持着。假使不列顚艦隊一旦受了意艦的壓迫，它便需到法國的地中海港口躱避。可是法國是吾允許他們進去呢？如果法國反對他們，國聯似乎不會決定制裁的。法國躊躇了。於是賴伐爾反問着，如果我們受了德國的攻擊，你們可打算行動吾呢？薩繆爾霍爾先生乾脆回說不知道；說這須視環境而定；說這應具有「伸縮性」（Elasticity）法國可不喜這些。英國乃對巴黎施以很大的壓力，，賴伐爾遂被迫贊成了經濟制裁。在十月的第三星期，正當國聯最後决議之前，法政府竭力反對禁運意貨的時候，英法的關係幾乎瀕於破裂。文件如雪片的往返着。法國究竟怕與倫敦决裂，終至屈伏於英國的命令了。</p>
<p>不列顚責備法國的策略延遲了經濟制裁的實施，鼓勵了墨沙里尼相信國聯的讓步及其幕後的調解。雖然法政府人員擔保法國必當遵守其制裁的義務，巴黎的新聞紙和許多商人却始終厭恨制裁，也許暗中的販運貨物仍未防止。法國表面上堅持着永久的談判以解决阿比西尼亞戰爭。據說不列顚之參加這些專家會議，爲的防止法國與羅馬訂立不利於倫敦的條文。</p>
<p>不列顚憤恨着法國的態度。但是他們的憤恨較之法國却是平和多了。法國深感着她在外交上已喪失了獨立。如果必須在不列顚與意大利之間探其一，法國當然取不列顚。不列顚對於反抗德國會有更多的帮助。但是法國却懐着一種與倫敦羅馬同時修好的幻想，正跟他們與莫斯科携了手同時又向柏林賫騷一樣。法蘭西的悲劇就在於拒絕了選定兩個中間的一個結果弄得兩者都歸於喪失。布爾雪維克因法國的浪求「納粹」而深感不悅，但法德的接近依然是渺茫得很。法國在制裁上與英國的合作使意大利受了苦，但同時法國的猶移不定仍不能使不列顚發生特殊的好感。</p>

<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>有一位熱心學畫的靑年來問我：『畫如何可以學成？』我對於這個廣泛的疑問，一時眞想不出答話來。但他正襟危坐，雙目注視我的嘴唇，好像滿望着這裏落出幾句學畫秘訣來。我刹時間把念頭轉到一般學畫者所最易犯的臨畫的弊端上，倉卒地答道：『畫如何可以學成？一言難盡。根本的方法，可說是手與眼要並重。卽不可專練手腕的描寫，必須並練眼睛的觀察。『我的意思？是學畫必須從寫生入手，不可徒事臨摹他人的作品。因爲畫的生命存在於物象中，决不存在於畫帖中。</p>
<p>這靑年學了一會，又來問我：『畫如何可以學成？』我看他過去的成績，大都偏重細部而忽略大體，因此所寫的物象都失了眞。就再吿訴他：『寫生不可重細部須重大體，務求全部同眞物一樣。』我的意思，是說他的觀察沒有精到，見其小而忘其大，因此他的描寫沒有全部正確。</p>
<p>這靑年學了一會，又來問我：『畫如何可以學成？』我看他過去的成績，雖然比前好些，但形狀還是不正。就再吿訴他：『寫生第一要注重「形」。無論細部或大體，形不正確，畫的基礎就不穩。』我的意思，是說他的描形還沒有全部正確，還要加意觀察。</p>
<p>這靑年學了一會，又來問我：『畫如何可以學成？』我看他過去的成續，比前好得多了，但形終未十分正確，細部及大體終未能完全兼顧，卽觀察的眼終未完全養成。就用抽象一些的話，再吿訴他：『學畫第一要寫出物象的「神氣」，不可專寫死板的形骸。』我的意思，是希望他把眼光放得遠大些，捉住物象的特點，描出物象的神氣。</p>
<p>但是，這話太抽象了，弄得這位靑年畫學生莫名其妙，索性把畫的學習停頓了。我很抱歉，恨不得把自己的體感分些給他，以完成共一簣之虧。有一天，我又與這靑平在某處相會，旁邊一個孩子正在搭七巧板。我看見他正在搭一個人的模樣，所用的只是二種形狀；正方形，三角形，平行四邊形（麻糖片形）。雖然簡陋不拘小節，然而大體很像人，而且神氣活現。我見了似有所感，卽興地對那靑年說：『學畫要取法於七巧板！』這靑年竟在這句話下頓悟，以後的成績，忽然進步，都有畫意了。</p>
<p>這話大類禪宗說法，似不可信；却是根據畫理的。原來畫繪上第一重要的事，是大體姿態的描寫。物象的神氣端在於此，繪畫的生命端在於此。有了大體，卽使細部忽略，亦無大碍。反之，大體不正，卽使細部十分精詳，亦屬徒勞。可舉日常生活爲　例；醫如看人，你的朋友遠遠地走來，卽使眉目未曾看淸，僅就大體姿態卽可看出其爲某君。反之，僅看一隻手，或僅看眉目一小部分，卽使是熟識的人，一時也不易認識。又如看風景，遠觀山形，如屛，如幛，如牛，如獅，如夏雲，如愁黛。這所見的正是山的神氣。反之，若身入山中，細看局部，卽不見其神氣，或竟不覺身在山中了。遠觀楊柳，如烟，如霧，如醉，如睡。這所見的正是柳的神氣。反之，若走近柳邊，細看局部，卽不見其神氣，似覺是另一種樹了。看電影要坐得遠，看畫要退遠幾步，也都是爲了遠看能見其大體，能見其神氣的原故。可知物象的神氣，不在細部而在大體。描畫而欲得神，必須注重大體姿態的描寫。</p>
<p>形象的表現中，專講大體的，莫如七巧板，或者十三塊凑成的益智板。牠們的工具的簡陋，使牠們不得不重大體。然而搭得巧妙的，不但形神畢肖，又留着給人想像的餘地，頗富畫意。這雖然是一種玩具，却暗示着畫法的要點。一般小學生用畫帖，初學用的畫譜，大都從正方，三角等幾何形體開始；寫生畫法，起稿時必須用直錢，卽使畫個皮球也得先用直綫圍成，都是根據這個畫理的。詳言之，學畫者執筆之前，宜對物象先作大體的觀察，忽略其詳細點，但把牠看作各種三角形，正方形，長方形等幾何形體所凑成的現象。畫的初稿，就不妨先用幾何形體表出，以後根據這大體，一一加詳描寫。這樣，無諭何等加詳描寫，大體總歸正確，卽物象的神氣總歸保全。那個學畫靑年的所以成功，便是走上了這學畫的大道的原故</p>
<p>學畫須從大體入手。這意思不是說細部描寫無用，是說大體爲重，細部爲輕。詳言之，畫不外三種：　大體與細部兼顧的，　顧大體而忽略細部的，　顧細部而忽略大體的。前兩種皆佳，第一種是良好的工筆畫。像文藝復興期的宗敎畫，古典派，浪漫派，寫實派的作品，皆屬其例。第二種是良好的粗筆畫或簡筆畫。像表現派，野獸派的作品，以及各種Shetch　條漫畫，皆屬其例。只有最後的第三種，顧細部而忽略大體的，才是劣品。像我國現在流行的某種月份牌，陰曆新年裏到處發賣的花紙兒，以及多數香烟裹的畫片，皆屬其例。這些畫中，大概描工很精詳，顏色紅紅綠綠，金碧輝煌。上眼鮮艷奪目，細看局部十分精緻但拿遠來看，大體都不對！比例不適當，部位不自然，形不正確，因而不像眞物，沒有神氣；甚而至於寄形怪狀，令人發笑或害怕。</p>
<p>缺乏美術敎養的人，低級趣味的人，對於繪畫不知大體，局部的工緻和鮮艷都能滿足他們的美慾。他們便是上述第三種繪畫的欣賞者。在世間，允其是在我國，這種欣賞者佔大多數。所以美術往往難於正當發展。所以自來的美術家，往往因爲曲高和寡，而躱入象牙塔中。</p>
<p>故我現在舉七巧板的比喩來，說明繪畫的要點，不但專爲繪畫的初學者說話。希望一般的人，也都具有這一點美術的欣賞力。二十五年二月三日</p>

<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>五，甘肅河西的民生一瞥</p>
<p>黃河發源自青海的噶達素齊老山，曲折流匯的橫截甘肅省境。如今這裹所謂河西，就從中國一隅的甘肅來說。河西位於甘肅，靑海，寧夏，新疆，內蒙的中樞，面積爲三九八·五一四方里，人口一·一一二·二八四人。地勢險要，居民繁殖，一方固可控制新蒙的邊圉，同時更足以屛障寗靑的近境，國防上，經濟上，在在都很佔重要，然而河山阻隔，交通不便，因此風氣錮塞，文化落後，遂爲內地人們所膜視了。在那兒因爲走馬看花，瞥見有限，只能將有關民生的犖犖大端，概述於下：</p>
<p>『風習』一地方的風士習俗，正是那一地方上人民生活的表徵，這話不錯吧，河西的民間就不像內地大都會裏的奢浮，他們的習俗尙古，民情敦厚。鄉野人家，大半務農或畜牧爲生，一年到底勤勞不息的工作，祗是獲了一分的利錢，就積蓄一分，不會浪費，更沒點兒奢華的氣象。男子不是耕牧，就是幹買賣的，女子閉戶紡織，總很能自食其力的有一門業務。惟是在這淳樸的古風中，郤有着很壞的三種習慣，實在是白璧的瑕玷，允其是西北可慮的病態：　蓄髮纏足的盛行；　迷信偶像的愚錮；　吸食鴉片的普遍。</p>
<p>河西的禮俗，居喪沿用古法，兒女對於父母的喪服三年，侄和孫服兩年；堂侄三月至九月不一定。平常男子達十八歲，女子達十五六歲爲婚嫁期，惟早婚風氣，隨處皆是，據說還有「指腹爲婚」和蓄「童養媳」的呢。結婚亦遵行古禮，但近時在城市大鎮裹，已漸可見中西合璧的或竟充分西化的舉行文明結婚了。『物產』河西幅圓遼闊，地利亦厚，故物產甚富。全區農作物有豆，麥，粱，黍，靑稞，水菸，以及牛，馬，羊，駝等大宗植動物產。决爲藥材，祈連山盛產大黃；民勤的枸杞，臨澤的從蓉；玉門，甘塔的甘草；高臺的黃茋；甘凉的鎖陽，麝香，鹿茸都很出名。</p>
<p>至於鑛產，蘊藏尤多，分佈遍地，金，銀，銅，鐵，鉛，煤炭，石油，琉璜，食鹽，旣備且豐，惜多未開採，致寳藏窖地，徒惹外入覬覦的野心，倘能投資用新法作大規模的開發，那末，財源旣啟，經濟充裕，塞漠國民的生計自舒了。</p>
<p>『教育』文化是社會進步的原動力，文化不能推展，社會生活自是無由前進的。河西的社會生活就是在這樣不發展的文化中，遲滯了上進的脚步。一半亦由於天災—水旱瘟疫的流行，和人禍—匪患兵焚的蔓延，人民陷於顛沛流離的困境中，衣食猶不能自給，經費更何從籌措，所以敎育很難發達。據調査所得，中等學校計共四處，武威省立第二師笵和省立第四中學各一所；酒泉省立第四師笵一所；張掖初級中學一所。四校全年經費共計三萬餘元。職教員每月薪額，最高的不過百元，最低的僅有六元。小學敎員的待遇，更爲微薄，普通一位敎員，全年薪金，至多不及百二十元，最低的僅得二三十元。似這樣拮据困難的經費，還能辦成功完善的學校敎育嗎？因此多持敷衍政策，初級小學敎科書。竟有仍用「三字經」等古老書本，作敎學材料的，這也許爲當地風氣未開，老學究者流保守成性的原故，可是，河西敎育情况，已可見一斑了。</p>
<p>六、甘肅的畜牧現狀</p>
<p>甘肅河流交錯，不乏水草野原，天然形勢，最宜畜牧，何况，還應合着環境的需求呢，據最近調査所得列下，以供有心改良西北牧畜的參玫。</p>
<p>（甲）種類及牧區　牧畜種類以羊爲最多，牛，馬，驢，騾，駱駝等决之，甘肅牧業較繁的區地，省東首推海原縣，次爲固原，會寗，省南要算臨澤，岷縣，夏河，西固等縣，產畜獨多，那兒所産蝙牛，毛牛，番黑羊，都很著名，省西的永登，民勤，山丹，永昌等縣，牧畜亦繁，在永登縣屬的連城松山，那一帶番民，家裏豢養着幾千匹牛和馬，加上一二萬頭綿羊的，亦在常觀，民勤縣民除牧羊外，兼有飼駝千數百匹的，前精所謂「鎭番馬家」，一戶飼駝，輒至兩萬匹以上，牧業繁盛，可睹一斑，省西的靖遠，景泰兩縣，允盛產羊，大小蘆塘所出的羔皮，據說决不亞於寗夏地方。</p>
<p>（乙）牧畜塲　甘肅牧業，大都由於人民獨家飼豢，隨地生息，牧畜公司或合衆牧畜塲之類的組織甚少，往昔甘州（張掖）凉州（武威）肅州（酒泉）西寗（現屬靑海）曾有過馬塲的設辦，那是屬於官廳管理的了，馬塲畜馬的數目達三萬餘匹，然而遭了連年兵燹，已蕩然無存，淸光緒時，在古浪縣轄的大馬營，設廠放牧，飼馬的達千餘匹，迨民國六年改爲種馬牧塲，旋復在海原平番（永登縣轄）馬啣山（皋蘭縣轄），設三分廠，都是隸屬在省政府軍事處的，沒幾何時，卽相繼停辦，歸於消滅了，民間較著的牧塲，就是連城松山灘（永登縣轄）北海（民勤縣轄）黃雁湖（武威縣轄）等處，圍範頗廣，至若景泰縣屬的大小蘆塘，五佛寺和夏和縣各地，郤是有地皆畜，無處不牧的。</p>
<p>（丙）飼養　牲畜的飼養方法，在民間多半依賴天然，就水草豐生的地方，隨意逐牧，有大羣豢養的，部多擇放在草原山麓或河灘的適中地點，然後因陋就簡的搭成廐圈，做收牧夜宿的歇地，騾馬等大畜，每夜歸廐時，必添喂麩料夜草一次，牛羊僅在冬季雪天裹喂給夜草，草料多在秋初時從山中割下長草，運藏房舍裏，儲備雪夜喂養的需用，茲並述人工添喂的數量，騾馬喂料—小豆，燕麥參半合成，和麩各二斤，草三斤，出羣良馬，每日麩料兼喂，普通馬部是喂料不給麩，喂麩不給料的，牛在冬雪時備喂夜草三斤，不喂麩而且忌用，怕吃了傷脾，産犢後留圈七日，飼豆瓣麵湯，使易下乳，羊在雪夜裏喂以草一斤又半，產羔後，留在圈裹三天，喂食草及麵湯使下乳，駱駝每日需吃小豆三斤，靑鹽半斤，上述數量，係就皋蘭縣境所調査，其他各縣或小異而大同。</p>

<h3 id="c70">歷史科演講　外國史（二） <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 中央大學敎授沈剛伯</p>
<p>纔所說的，本是一切歷史公有之點。但是外國史對於現代的中國靑年，實在是更爲有用。因爲牠可以補足本國史的缺點。我們民族的美德，是孝，弟，仁，義，勤，儉，和平；所缺的，是公而忘私，國而忘家，不避艱險，奮鬥到底的精神。本國史中，固然也不少那種鞠躬盡瘁，舍己救人的模範，但同時也充滿那黃老派的理論事蹟。結果是自强不息，成仁取義的精神，往往被那明哲保身，清靜無為的論調中和了，抵消了，弄得等於零了。至若外國史中，是只有前一種的榜樣，很少後一種的議論，豈不是最足以救中國傳統思想之弊嗎？還有一層，中國史書，多是官史。那奉命修史的人，固然是學問淵博，但是總免不了政治力量的枸束，脫不了正統思想的範圍。因此他們選擇材料，記述事實，都不十分自由：得的結論，自難全合眞理。所以孟子早就說：「盡信書，不如無書。」這是學中國史的難處，靑年學生閱世不深，見解有限，若是沒有人指導；是很難從這裏面得到眞理的。至若外國史，都是私人的作品，他有很大的自由，不多受外力的牽制。加以他們的社會學，考古學，又極進步，用科學方法，藉科學的帶助，寫出來的歷史，自然是比較精密，合乎眞理。所以靑年學生，若要培養思想的自由，練習觀察的精密，訓練判斷的正確，是還以多讀外國史書爲最有益。</p>
<p>這樣看來，外國史不獨可以給予我們科學的精神，更能够陶鑄我們偉大的人格，用處如此其大，還能說牠與我無關，學牠是白費光陰嗎？</p>
<p>第二種反對中學講外國史的議論，是由於不明中學外國史內容的原故。中學生學外國史，不是要原原本本，「殫見洽聞。」那一切戰爭的熱鬧，宮廷的瑣事，宗敎的聖跡，金石的藝術，名人的逸事，詞林的掌故，同那些銅劍，石斧，破盌，殘磚的考究，都是史學專家的事情，用不着中學生操心。中學生所應該知道的，只是外國政法制度變　的大略，經濟組織演進，的概况同學術思想發展的方向。曉得這些，就能對於世界潮流的趨勢，有正確的認識；也就可以明瞭現代的國際形勢，及各國對於我們的關係了，所以中學外國史的內容，實不在博而在要，不在多而在精。那嗎，拿甚麽來做選擇材料的標凖咧？意大利的歷史學者克若斯（Crocc）說：「歷史的特性，是其思想之現代化。凡與現代無關的記載，都算不得歷史」。這話在史學專家看起來，頗有語病。但若是拿來做中學生選擇史料的標準，確是極對。所以我勸各位照若斯的主張，去讀外國史，遇着一件事，先問牠是不是直接間接與今日的世界有關。若有關係，則事情雖小，也應注意。若是無關，則牠的本身縱然有趣，也不必管。譬如說最先到美洲的人，也許是北歐的Vikngs也許是更早的中國人。專門學者，儘可以竭畢生之力，去研究這僩問題。至於中學生，則可置之不問。因為無論如何，美洲的開發，是從哥倫布去過後纔起。以前到過Califoonia　的Vikings，同到過坎拿大的中國人，實在是無所影響於新大陸，無所貢獻於舊世界。研究他們，並不足以帮助我們了解今日的美洲，我們又何必管牠呢？再舉個例說，希臘史上，都講那Pelopomesion　War，羅馬史上，都講那PunieWar。這兩件事，對於古代的希臘，羅馬，確是極爲重要；若是把牠們當作道德上的敎訓看，也頗有價値。但試問雅典帝國之崩頹，何嘗妨及近代平民政治之發展；斯巴達之暫時稱霸，何嘗有關於今日軍國主義之盛行；那Hannib　的蓋世威名，又何嘗影響到今日的歐洲，菲洲？那嗎，中學生又何苦費心去記牠呢？一本小小的外國史敎科書裏面，類似乎此的記載，也還不少。好些朝代的戰爭，暫行的制度，不見得都與現在有關。我們若概能以「現代性」三字作硏究西洋史的標凖，就可删繁就簡，扼要省事了。</p>
<p>第三派的人，主張探討本國的光榮歷史，以發揚民族精神，這是對的。但說學外國史便易惑於邪說，動搖自己好的傳統思想，就是只知其一，不知其二了。人類的歷史，原是整個的，世界少的文化，都是彼此有關的。若不問全部歷史，只學局部的歷史，那是瞎子摸象，永不會眞正認識象的！比如說漢族最强盛的時代，莫過漢唐，試問不明瞭當時的外國情形，能完全了解漢唐的政治設施嗎？與今日關係最大的，莫過淸朝，試問硏究近百年的歷史，不知道外國史成功嗎？至若宋元的歷史，處處與外國史錯綜有關，那更不必說了。不獨政治如此，學術亦然。吾國的歷，算，醫，藥，藝術，音樂，宗敎信仰，衣冠，裝飾，乃至等韵切韻之學，明心見性之論，都曾受過外國文化的影饗。我們要追本溯源，懂理國故，實在非參考外國史不可。譬如一個人要明白他祖父父親的言行，僅認識他的祖父父親，是不够的。還得知道與他祖父父親常來往的朋友親戚。甚至連他們用過的奴僕，相爭過的仇敵，都須曉得纔行，所以說發揚國粹，萬不可採取深閉固絕的態度。</p>
<p>况且今日不是開闢時代。我們不明白外國的眞象，便無從對付外國。現在的外國，都是從牠們的過去歷史中演變出來的，不知道牠們的歷史，便永不會了解牠們的現狀，也就無從判斷牠們的得失，預測牠們的未來自定應付的方針。舉一個例說，現在的世界，實受三種主義的支配；就是自由主義，共產主義，同法西斯主義。爲甚麽英法諸國，獨能保持自由中義？爲甚麽俄國能實行共產？爲甚麽法西斯主義偏在意德諸國盛行咧？道是至少非從近兩百年歷史裏面，找不出牠的原因的。要是不知道牠們特殊的歷史背景，如何能批評牠的好壞，推測牠的成敗，幷决定我們對他的態度咧？淸末變法無效，民國初年試行議會政治失敗，同近來共産運動之斵傷中國元氣，與種種舶來主義之不全合國情，徒擾人民，都是只知外國的皮毛，不明白牠歷史背景的原故。我們若能澈底了解種種主義之前因後果，就自然知道自定國情，審緩急，以最經濟妥善的辦法，去取人之長，補已之短，革新建設，事半功倍，那會盲從人家屢走錯路，削足適屨，畫虎不成咧？人們常說「知已知彼」。我們要眞能「知彼」，須要學人家的歷史；要澈底的「知已」也得要參考比較人家的歷史。總之，若是沒有世界史的知識，想在今日做一個有用的國民，是决不可能的。</p>
<p>但是學外國史，不是曉得許多零星史料，就够了的。任何知識，都要澈　；一知半解，是很危險的前幾年有個外交官到美國，對新聞記者談話，說：「東三省成了東方的Alsace-Loraines」。他只知道，法德兩國，因爭Akace-Lorraine而成爲世仇，牽動全歐；不知道德國人對於Alsace-Lorraine的歷史關係，與日本人對束三省的歷史關係，完全不同。錯引典故，便不覺的喪失國體，無異爲日本人張目了。這樣看來，學外國史，若不眞正學通，便自作聰明，牽强傳會,不獨是鬧笑話，還要誤大事的。</p>
<p>若要學通，就得硏究學通的方法。各中學同學，將來升學之後，或學理工，或習醫農，也許永遠再沒有正式學外國史的機會。這點外國史的知識，全靠在中學的時候學得。以匆匆幾年的短時間，想學通幾千年的世界歷史，那更非有一種以簡馭繁的辦法不可。照着書死唸，是於事無濟的。</p>
<p>要想得着治史的方法，先須决定讀史的態度。同是一本書，「仁者見仁，智者見智」，看法不同，方法也就自然不同。所以要知道好的歷史方法，先得養成正常的歷史觀念。往嘗治史的人，有的講甚麽「微言大義」，「褒貶筆削」，那是以哲學的態度去歷史裏面，找倫理學的敎訓。有的專討論天災人禍，善惡，因果，那是木宗敎觀念，去歷史裹求神學的論證，有的　推敲鑒字句，賞史筆，說甚麽Thucydidest的記事，文簡意長,Gibbo的叙述，有聲有色，這是以文學眼光去歷史裏面，尋藝術的美。還有人主張超人史觀，把一部歷史，部當作幾個英雄的事蹟：有人彼吹「民族史觀」，把人類一切的文化，都當作本種民族的創造；有人閘發「唯物史觀」，把人看得同螞蟻蜜蜂一樣，好像上下千古的事情，都不外爭衣奪食—這都是以政客的態度，去歷史裏而找他們的宜傳資料。這些人各有各的成見，也就各有各的方法；但全不是硏究歷史的正當態度，允其不是中學生應有的歷史觀念。因爲歷史不是哲學，不是文學，更不是政治工具；牠實在是整個人類進化的過程。所以我們應該把着進化的觀念，本着科學的態度，去裏面尋求人類演進的定律。同學「自然歷史」的人，硏究小小的動植物一樣；要用發光鏡子，去看淸牠的整個，再用顯微鏡去細考牠的組織；萬不可戴上一具有顔色的鏡子，把一切柬西，都看變了色！（未完）</p>

<p>「各位同事今天是省府成立的週年紀念日、我們在此舉行慶祝的意義、不外檢討過去、策勵將來、藉此機會、兄弟特將一年以來的經過、簡單的向各位同事報告一下、省府自去年成立以後、劉主席認為負有三大使命、　統一全川、　減輕人民痛苦、　建設新四川、茲分別略述於後、</p>
<p>統一四川　第一、統一四川、因為以往有防區的分割、無形中把一個整個的四川、彷佛分成若干小省份、表面儘管有合法的省府、事實上所有的政令、一點兒也沒有貫澈實行、當新省府成立之初、主席及各委員、認為不把防區打破、則省府將來仍將成為一有名無實的機關、所以一面呈報就職、一面電各軍首領、言明收回政權、完成統一的意義、幸各軍首領、均能顧全大局、在很短的時間、通同將政權交還省府、省府為使政令易於貫澈起見、復將全川縣局長同時調動、使甲區的縣長換到乙區、乙區的縣長換到丙區、這樣一來、過去的分離杆隔之弊、庶乎消減淨盡、所以這第一點統一四川早已完全達到了、</p>
<p>减輕民累　第二、減輕人民負担、過去防區制的形成、各軍區內征收稅欵、不特無限制、且無標準、甚焉者一年十征、其次亦六七征不等、新省府成立後、感覺民眾負担過重、亟欲設法減輕、以抒民困、但當時環境特殊、全川旣有數十萬軍隊、餉欵浩繁、而勦匪費尤刻不容緩、致仍定為一年四徵、而回溯二十四年度、實際上人民負担、尚不止此、第一、因收回防區、是從三月一日起、而以前各軍預征的欵子不少、第二、建碉堡、修公路、等等要政、行營規定、本不須附加糧稅、但各縣情形不同、為求負担平均起見、無已、只有在糧稅上略為附加、以應急需、有此二因、說到減輕民累、我們並未辦到、祇在可能範圍內所做為人民謀福利的事、如實行一稅制、減輕稅率、取消各地關卡、減輕人民行路的麻煩、尚覺差強人意耳、</p>
<p>建設事業　第三、建設新四川、四川以往情形、過度紊亂、元氣傷甚、說到要建設一個新四川、是很不容易的一件事、尤其不是短時間所能辦到、與其唱高調說什麼幾年計劃、倒不如切切實實做出幾件成績來好一點、所以、在二十四年度實施政綱領內、關於建設事項、皆我們事實上可以辦到者、當草擬綱領時、行營尚未規定經費數目、後因軍事費的膨脹、收支不易適合、全省行政費、全年度規定為一千二百萬元、各種事業、為經費所限、未能充分發展、加之後來剿匪軍事的延長、更致各種新事業、未能達到我們預期地步、</p>
<p>各廳工作　各廳處工作、過去一年內、所辦到之事、亦尚不少、民政方面、如劃全省為十八行政督察區·及縣府的裁局改科·分區設署、都先後實現了、又如養成縣政基幹人才、特設縣政人員訓練所、已有兩期、學員畢業人數、有六百以上、而地政亦在籌備、其他的事業、大部份亦均在策劃進行中、最近的將來、當為一一實施、財政方面、如國稅與地方劃分、舊債的整理、以及剔除田賦的積弊、收回地鈔、設三省銀行、裁撤苛雜等、就施政綱領看來、也算達到了十分六七、教育方面、如全省教育經費、確定為每年一百八十萬、整頓高等教育、裁併重複院系、加緊軍訓童訓、檢定學校教師、倡導義教、諸如此類、都是在挽回風氣、造就真實人才上用功夫的、建設方面、如都江堰的大修、川黔·川陝·兩公路的通車、與夫川湘·川鄂·路的建設、都是從生產方面去建設、最近省府與鐵道部通力合作、並謀建築成渝鐵路、蓋今日之四川、說到建設、不僅注重開發、並須兼顧國防也、</p>
<p>保安方面　保安方面、保安處成立後、首在滌除積弊、將全省團隊改編為四百一十二個保安中隊、在經費方面、也有了正當的規定、不得任意附加、其他在省創辦保安隊幹部訓練班、各區則辦縣長訓練班、壯丁隊幹部訓練班等、都是積極進行的、</p>
<p>轉移風氣　最後、尚有為諸同事言者、中國人普通毛病、自已不肯做事、而嫉妬別人做事、這是很不好的現象、我認為許多事不怕包辦、只怕不幹、今後我們要評論一件事或批評一個人時、務須得到肯定事實、然後再下斷語、捕風捉影之詞、出之普通人、已屬不好、出之公務人員、尤不應該、劉主席隨時以轉移風氣期望同人、希望同人多多注意、庶幾不失公務員身份、且可為人表率也、</p>
<p>鄧氏講詞中所述川省府一年來推行新政情形、均係事實、短短一年中、得有如斯成績、進步亦不為不多、此固由於中央當局之督率、而川當局之努力邁進、亦良足稱道也、（十二日國聞社）</p>

<p>— 胡先骕</p>
<p>殺蟲劑之研究</p>
<p>自防治害蟲研究漸有進展以來，殺蟲劑之研究，乃為人所注意。在歐美各邦，通常多用鉛化砒巴黎綠青酸鉀等藥品。在中國工業不發達，農產品價格低下之情況之下，利用購自外邦之工業製造殺蟲劑，殊不經濟。故有研究國產植物殺蟲劑之必要。近年浙江省昆蟲局之用巴豆粉殺蟲，大見著效。然國產植物，可以作殺蟲劑者甚夥，不過須生物學研究機關擔任此項工作，方易收效耳。將來衛生事業進行，甚至對於驅除瘡蚊，亦須利用國產之殺蟲劑也。</p>
<p>其他經濟植物之研究</p>
<p>除上列之各項經濟植物外，尚有多種經濟植物，皆須加以研究，如由海藻製碘，與細菌培養劑，牧草軟木豆類青肥與茶場中之豆類灌木鞣質原料，橡皮樹以外之橡皮原烊，蜜源植物等等，不可縷述。皆為現有之中央農業試驗所無人扌與財力以研究之，而政府宜委託資助生物研究機關，以積極調查與研究之者也。</p>
<p>植物病害之研究</p>
<p>損害植物者，除害蟲外，即為病菌。二者為害之程度，未易軒輕。如麥銹病所致小麥之損失，為數極巨。馬鈴薯疫病，昔年曾引起愛爾蘭之大饑荒；美國之栗樹火痿病，至將美國產之栗樹完全滅絕；白松銹病，亦幾使美國東部不能種植此項最可寶貴之森林。中國農林產之菌害，尚未經大規模之調查研究，而此項研究，須從植物病理學之根本之菌學方面下手。現在二三生物研究機關，正努力為初步之研究工作，亟宜提携鼓勵之，使得從速邁進也。</p>
<p>發酵菌類與細菌之研究</p>
<p>發酵菌類與細菌，關係於國計民生者極大。巴斯德研究之所得，足以償普法戰後法國對於德國之賠欵而有餘。土壤細菌之研究，關於農業者至大。酒精工業，甜菜糖工業，製酒工業，紅茶製造，醬油製造等，在在與發酵菌類與細菌之研究有關。吾國民族，為未知科學方法而最能利用發酵菌類與細菌者。如醬及腐乳，粉絲紅麵米皮蛋之製造等，皆為吾民族所獨擅之技術，而歐美民族所不知者也。近世惟日本曾努力以科學方法研究發酵生物，吾國極宜追踪亟起，以大力從事此項之研究，其影響於國計民生者，殆不可以億計也。</p>
<p>水產生物之調查與研究</p>
<p>中國海岸，北起自渤海灣，南至廣州灣，自北溫帶至熱帶，綿亘數千里，水產之富，不言可喻。而國人之消耗水產食物，亦在他民族之上。每年自日本有大宗水產之入超。在過去雖不乏研究水產學之人，惜皆於水產動植物分類學，無深刻之研究，故歷年雖辦有水產學校，於吾國之水產業毫無裨益，不但不能以生態學研究之結果，增加水產之出產，即吾國水產之調查，亦無法進行。又如與醫學及國防有關之碘之出產問題，亦以無研究海藻之專家，未能著手研究。又如吾國素以養魚業著名，然所養之種類至少。若加以科學研究，則可養之種類，當不止此。又如昆布吾國每年消費甚多，面皆來自日本。然日人已在大連一帶，移植昆布，成績甚優。在吾國其他海岸，未嘗不能試為移植此類海藻也。又如防治瘡蚊，今日多培養特種在水血掠食孑廴之魚類。此種研究，關係於衛生者至大。如滇粵之瘴氣，已證明為惡性瘡疾。而當惡瘡盛行之時，每至全縣人口死淨。以後如欲開發熱帶邊境，非由治瘡蚊下手不可。說者謂羅馬帝國之敗亡，由於瘡疾；而中美洲邁耶（Maya）文化之滅絕，亦由於黃熱病瘡蚊之故。今日意大利在羅馬近郊之治瘡蚊，即用移養魚類之方法。此類研究，亦今日不可緩之要政也。今幸國內水產動物學家，大有人在；而研究海藻者，亦有專家。現在中央研究院動植物研究所，已大規模著著於海洋學之研究，與水產之調查。政府亟宜以全力支持之，並鼓勵其他生物學機關，從事於此項研究也。　　　　（未完）</p>

<p>中華表演精彩奪得決賽權陳鎮和八面威風獨獲三球</p>
<p>西聯足球會萬國盃賽、中華對猶太、昨日下午三時在逸園足球場　交鋒、慕名前往作壁上觀者二三千人、猶太隊在兩年前國際盃賽中、曾以一對〇戰勝中華、近來實力大非昔比、而中華隊猛將如雲、正方與未艾、故賽來成一面倒、上半時中華僅以一比零佔優、下半時蕕太隊仍一無振作、各隊員戰得粗疲力盡、中華隊乃趁勢進攻、鐘勇森孫錦頂陳鎮和相繼命中、以六球全勝猶太、總結果七對零中華凱旋、得決賽權、將與葡萄牙爭奪錦標、茲錄雙方陳容如下、</p>
<p>鐘勇森　首關紀錄</p>
<p>三時未屆、雙方已戎裝登場、疏松腳起、迨裁判員　脫銀角、聲起、雙方即佈陣肉博、敵將白林基撥動阿鬥、輪送前敵、傑柯勃得球直闖、江李兩內衛、保衛如銅牆鐵壁、中途截下、曹秋亭邊陲入寇、大刀闊斧、連陷敵軍防線、遙傳中軍、鐘勇森枕戈以待、頂上開花、首開紀錄、此球之入、僅二分鐘耳、</p>
<p>孫鐵腿　臥地一掃</p>
<p>中華隊旗開得勝、全軍奮發、氣燄萬丈、賈幼良謀取邊境、進兵饒道而攻、曹秋亭舉腳叩門、笛脫五區、不慌不忙、從容擊出、小曹因與霍雷斯汀奪球互撞、足踝受傷離場、未幾仍複上場應戰、鐘勇森揭旗起義、與兵征敵、兵臨敵軍腹地、冷放強弩、守門振臂揮出、秋亭趕上轉傳中央、孫鐵腿臥地一掃、腳頭見准、良機坐失、</p>
<p>十二碼　猶太幸免</p>
<p>敵軍M格林勃越界築路、爭球過急、受傷踣地、由同伴扶之出場、小黑炭勇冠三軍、崛起中原、單騎深入虎穴、G格林勃力阻、球越黑炭孫鐵腿腳步遲滯、趕之不及、M格林勃傷愈登場、四週碧眼兒鼓掌表示歡迎、小黑炭東山再起、擲土重入、霍雷斯灑急忙中手悮觸球、判罰十二碼、孫鐵腿權充儈子手、球朝右綱角打雲、被守門擋出、副成野球、未幾、上半時告終、中華以一球佔先、</p>
<p>小鐘二　次試牛刀</p>
<p>檸檬過後、易地再戰、猶太隊擬作困獸之戰、洗雪前恥、反攻甚烈、何奈曇花一現、又復一蹶不振、曹秋亭左路進兵、鐘勇森冷箾暗放、G格林勃阻擋不遠、小鐘再試牛刀、應聲入綱、湊成兩隻、賈幼良再度興兵、球中門柱彈回、此時猶太圍攻我軍、幸保禦得力、未遭毒手、孫錦順率師出征、一記叩門、球中霍雷斯汀身上彈在球門前盤旋、鐘勇森斜裹竄出、臥地掃射、又　告中的、比數為三對零、</p>
<p>陳鎮和　輕車熟路</p>
<p>猶太隊至此、已戰得人困馬疲、祇有招架、一無回手、故險象叢生、球常在境內徘徊、賈幼良邊域運兵、孫鐘順接草送糧、前後策應、轉遞黑炭、三傳五遞、直副敵軍城前、小黑炭不負眾望、春然一腳、球直入綱角、班師而返、猶太隊雖極度掙扎、終以旗遜一著、難以發展、陳鎮和輕車熟路、領兵響導、盤至相當地域、轉派錦順、鐵腿起處、敵門又陷、</p>
<p>七對零　淘汰猶太</p>
<p>猶太隊屢失陣地、全軍怒發沖冠、動作乃漸趨粗魯、白林基中軍起兵、格S林勃與龐卻兒左右協助、如虎添翼、連越我軍三道防線、無奈張榮才身手靈敏、高擋低攔、均能化險為夷、孫鋮腿率領三軍遠征、被守門擋出、奔上再射命中、陳鎮和擲土重臨敵陳、與孫鐵腿搭擋、連闖三關、又破敵陣、俄而銀角長鳴、雙方息戈收軍、中華以七對零淘汰猶太、獲得決賽權、</p>

<p>麥令對鷹隊</p>
<p>上海籃球會今晚甲甲組海賊對協興、當有驚人劇戰、再有麥令對鷹隊、競爭甲乙A部決審權、茲將四場秩序列左、</p>
<p>昨夕戰績</p>
<p>優遊勝東華甲甲　六六對四一</p>
<p>全黑勝群毅甲乙B　三九對三七</p>
<p>昨夕兩場比賽、先由優遊對東華之甲甲組、優遊由許文奎指揮三軍、一路領導、東華始終未能抬頭、結果以四一對六六挫於優遊、甲乙B全黑群毅、經劇烈爭紮後、判定勝負、全黑以三九對三七得該部首席、兩場戰狀誌之如左、</p>
<p>全黑得寶群毅敗北</p>
<p>全黑毅兩隊、在甲乙B部中、形勢均等、昨晚相逢、雙方感抱必勝之志、爭得該部優勝、將來與A部首席者決奪魁軍、故交綏中、均謹慎應付、攻守之間、週密萬分、以二十一對十六結束上半場、全黑占先、</p>
<p>羣毅諸將於再戰聲中、振奮有加、全黑亦當仁不讓、全黑曾以三十一對二十二比佔先、嗣後群毅之盧·董·陶各有建樹、追成平局、此時戰情緊張、此起彼落、三十對三十、三十三對三十三、既而又三十五均等、復又三七並呈、正在軒輊難分中、周智斜中一球、恰巧鑼聲一響、時間告畢、全黑以三九對三七告捷、占該部首席、</p>
<p>優遊努力東華敗挫</p>
<p>兩軍對壘之初、鹹以東華可獲勝利、蓋以驃悍如麥令、當被擊潰故也·那知事出非常、角逐之下、經三四回合中、許文奎東闖西探、東華之籃、頻為所襲、再加孫惠培憑其高大身軀、趁火打刦、致分數屢增壘添、東華陣中、僅馮念華略有建樹、陳陸兩將、貢獻亦微、孫寶慶除防禦工作外、罰球亦無把握、上半時完、優遊三五、東華十五、結果六六對四一、優遊得勝、全局為許文奎得二十八分之多、在茲嚴密監視下、確定難能、馮念華得二十分、亦非易易也、</p>

<p>『啊梅格！你有什麼修養，使你能夠那麼忍受這個？』蜀對她輕輕說着，因為她到門口來他們，露出一些好意相招的微笑，也不改其平日溫婉之態，只是更加婉罷了。</p>
<p>『親愛的蜀，這十年來使我快樂的愛情至今還是我的靠山。這是不會死滅的，我現在覺得喬恩更加是我的了，』梅格輕輕說道；而在她的兩眼裏一種溫柔的信心是那麼明朗而美好，蜀就不能不相信她，覺得愛情的不朽如她所有的，真要感謝上天之賜了。</p>

<h3 id="c147">債劵整理之成功 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>我國財政大抵在過去五六年間，每年約短絀一萬四五千萬元左右（十九年度竟達二萬一千七百萬元之钜額）。除增加新稅外、多舉債以資挹注。在民國十六年以前，外債額逾於內債額挹注。在民國十六年以前、外債額逾於內債額、其後則內債增加，外債止借，斯亦吾國借債、政策進步之一象徵。據財政部財政年鑑（二十四年九月出版）所載，截至民國十五年度止，內債計三八一，一六六，二四三元，外債計三，〇三四，九六一，三七四元。就其與公債總額比較而言，前者為一一·一五%，後者為八入·八五%。民國十六年度至二十一年度起債額，內債一，二五六，九一五，八六四元，佔九〇·七七%，外債僅三〇，七二九，〇四五元，佔九·二三%。二十二年度起債額，內債五四九，五九一，四一三元，佔八九·五五%；外債六四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，佔一〇·四五%。夫舉借我債，在經濟上政治上，俱不無流弊，故苟非內外債無法增發時，不宜嘗試。今外債起債額漸少，則我國經濟政治之「附庸性」亦呆逐漸消失、故筆者認此為一良好現象。</p>
<p>雖然、借債實為寅吃卯糧之一種救急辦法而已。公經濟度出為入，多發公債，有所不免。即發行內債，亦須顧及人民負擔能力，及其所予整個國民經濟之影響如何，否則足以釀成傷民耗財之現象。吾國實情奚似乎？請觀左表：（根據王宗培「一月來之內國公債」，銀行週報二十卷三號。）發行額單位為百萬元，此外為元。</p>
<p>表中可注意者，二十一年並未發行公債，此非財政平衡所致，恐為公債市場已呈飽和狀態之故。更就各年年末滾存而觀，則除二十一年減六千余萬元外，每年均增加甚速。二十四年較諸二十三年，竟增加三萬萬元弱。在百廢待舉之今日，吾人自不驚奇公債之膨脹。唯是借債必須償還，據二月一日持券人公會所發表之宣言，至本年一月底止，政府歷年發行各種內國公債庫券憑證和等，共尚負債十四萬六千餘萬元，每月應付本息一千五百餘萬元之钜。由是財政歲出方面，債務費所佔比率，日益增大。財政困窠窘，則增發公債；公債增發，益增重財政困難：此理財之感棘手者非歟！</p>
<p>（注）單位為千元，二十二年度以前，均係財政部決算，二十三年二十四年度，則為預算額。</p>
<p>歲出方面以債務費之增加，勢不得不多借新債以資週轉。據財政年鑑及財政部發表之統計材料，歷年以債借欵收入及對歲入總額，與其間百分率有如左表。</p>
<p>（注）單位千元，念二年度以前為決算額，二十三年度二十四年度為預算額。</p>
<p>試對照第二表與第三表，吾人即知舉債僅足增加財政之困難。債務約佔歲出百分之三十以上，借欵收入則僅佔百分之二十，誠所謂得不償失矣。</p>
<p>公債膨脹，結果於財政既無所利，其予工商業以不良影響，則甚顯然。過去發行之公債，其額票利息雖不高，然多折價出銷，故實際利息昂貴至一分二分不等。投機者覷其利息之優厚，活活躍於證券市場，即投資者亦因其利息倍蓰，舍他種投資而不顧。在此種情形下，社會資金多流入證券市場，工商業深感資金匱乏，無從挹注，而有今日凋敝現象。職是之故，為整理財政本身計，為整理財政本身計，為救濟工商業計，實有整頓現行公債制度之必要。</p>
<p>整理之道，不外二端：一曰收縮公債，一曰延期減息。際斯建設伊始，外患日亟之秋，收縮公債，勢難辦到。延期還本，減低利息，二十一年曾經一度施行，尚不至予證券信用以不良影響。此次再度推行，當無大礙。延期還本，則政府之債務費相對減低。第在他方面言之，則影響於他日之發債能力。蓋延期還本，不外將今日之負擔移諸翌日也。是故為未雨綢繆計，今後應力謀撙節，以為收縮公債之張本。他日發生行公債，如用於建設事業，則以其本身可以生利，還本付息，尚不足虞。若僅因彌補財政不足而發行公債，則他日還本付息，恐較困難。至減息問題，論難頗多。鄙意以為減低利息，雖暫使持券者受若幹損失，然就整個國民經濟而言，則不徒無害，仰且有益。何則？利息減低，則政府債務負擔輕，毋庸增稅或增發公債以增加歲入，此其一端。即昔覷其厚利而作證券投資者，今後將來裹足不前，由是而資金可流向產業界方面，此其二端。小不忍則亂大謀，孰取孰舍，明眼人自知之，毋庸吾人喋喋。</p>
<p>關於公債還本付息之擔保問題，此次發行之統一公債，仍照舊有債券原案規定，在關稅項下除撥付賠欵以外債所餘之稅疑支付。然而復興公債三萬四千萬元本息，要待關稅項下撥付賠欵外債及十七年金融長期公債二十五年統一公債之後，所餘之稅欵為基金。至於每年應還本息，單就統一公債一種而論，除二十五年祇付本息一期（七月三十一日）不計外，茲將每隔五年，應還本息數目列表於後，（以千元為單位）</p>
<p>（注）　年還清為一次本息之數，四十九年還清還本付息最多之幾年，要達一萬四千九百余萬元，平均總在一萬萬元以上。復興公債本息尚不在內。但其債額既興統一丙債相伯仲（統一丙債為三萬五千萬元）則其歷年之還本付息，亦可比照統一丙債之數字，（參閱二表）並將全國關稅列後。（單位元）</p>
<p>吾國公債投機之活躍，實匪他國所能及。夷考厥由，蓋亦因政府統制之松懈所致。關於此點，可參照一九三三年及一九三四年之美國統制證券法案及交易所投機取締法案，酌視吾國實情，制定中國統制證券條例。不倿前曾於美國二種法案有所介紹，見本刊第五十九期及六十四期「美國證券投資之新轉變」及「美國證券統制之新進展」二文。其主要手段，不外取締期貨交易，嚴格規定經紀人之資格及活動範圍，增高證據金，隨時檢查經紀人及交易所之賬簿及他項記錄等。上述諸端，苟能運用得宜，投機活動自可杜絕，同時並無礙。正當投資者。</p>
<h3 id="c148">法郎果有轉機乎 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣裕聲</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在世界通貨鬥爭中，處於絕對被動地位之法郎，最近有漸趨平穩之勢。二月六日法蘭西銀行之貼現率由五厘減至二厘半，其原因一為法郎匯價之堅挺，一個月來以美元計算頗有漲起，以英鎊計算則甚為穩定。二為美國現金之運法，載至二月七日已達一千四百萬美元。三為國內私人儲積之大理貨幣因受貶值威協，紛紛流回市面，均予法國以減低貼現率之機會。因此頗有認為法國此舉足以增加國內民眾及國外投機家對於法政之信任，並消　英國借欵之謠傳，為法郎轉機之表示。吾人證之事實，加以分析，即知此皆為社會心理的一種反應而已，法郎正有其根本之危機在。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>法蘭西銀行貼現率之變動，六個月中達六次之多。法國金融界今日已知驚弓之鳥，最易波動，倘無穩固之根基，則目前貼現率之減低亦轉瞬可逝，無補大局。上述三種減率之原因，一經推究，皆不足為現狀之保障也。緣法郎在鎊元壓迫之下，勢將崩潰。而英美又惟恐其崩潰致累及鎊元之安全。故一個月來英美均予援助，英在倫敦市場購進黃金，維持法郎，亟欲將英法匯率穩定於每英鎊合七五·〇六法郎；美則運出黃金，減低美元，以抬高法郎之匯價。凡此法郎皆在鎊元控制之下獲得暫時的穩定，予法人以一種心理上之安慰而已。考之實際，上週美國運進法種之黃金尚不及法國運往倫敦之數；此外國內貨幣流額雖有增加，並無補於法郎之國際地位。故此次法郎穩定之根基，至為脆弱，轉而顧其危機，則日益深刻。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>法郎之根本危機，在於鎊元以匯價之優勢擊破金本位集團之陣線。使法國之對外貿易江河日下，在國外既無競爭餘地，在國內復受外貨傾銷。歷年貿易總額之銳減與人超額之激增，均成一面倒之勢，引起國內物價下跌，工商業衰落，資金逃避，本年一月十日法蘭西銀行之準備額為六六，二六七百萬法郎，較上年同期減少一五，七四八百萬法郎。政府雖厲行緊縮政策，勉渡重重難關。結果使經濟狀況愈形萎縮，法郎病症日益深刻。故今日談法郎之前途，必從此點出發，一時黃金之進口，利率之減低，皆為枝節問題，未足以言轉機也。法郎問題果仍須爭謀補救之策，法國此時實惟兩途可循：治標則為英國借欵之商措；治本則為法郎半價之改善。顧法國人民受歷史教訓，大戰後曾一度貶值，遭遇極大損害，對於通貨存一種心理上之恐懼，歷次內閣無不以維護法郎為前提，平價之改變自有困難。惟今日時移境遷，大勢所趨，吾人深信法郎必將為世界通貨重定運動之發動者，為期當不甚遠也。</p>

<p>最近在金融組織的改進中，有籌設城鄉銀行之議。關於這點，吾人認為應得注意。辦法妥善，設施得當，則可以輔助農村經濟的發展，改善農業的生產與農民的生計。不得其法，或沒有一貫整個的政策，則恐適足以增強商業資本對於農業的壓迫，甚至於為地方土劣豪富開剝削農民的方便之門。是以原提出數點，討論於後，以供商榷之助。</p>

<p>吾人所謂城鄉，係指去大城市較遠的內地而言。至附近大都市的區域，則銀行林立，金融組織事實上已甚完備，城鄉銀行的組織，不關重要。故吾人所論的城鄉銀行，具有屬於僻遠的內地的意義在內。惟有在這些區域，經濟的發展尚在幼稚時期，金融組織尚未完備，城鄉銀行的組織才有意義。在這些區域，銀行的組織，資本一項，特別成為問題。年來經濟恐慌的結果，若幹內地城市，商務蕭條，貨運停滯，不但沒有資金的積集，且大都負債累累，困頓而不能自拔。在此種環境之下，就地籌集資金，在若幹區域事實上殊難辦通。即令能夠勉強湊集，而為數微末。在經濟上必無何種作用。是以由當地商民籌集股本，事實上不無困難。其次，由地方官廳撥資開設，其困難與危險更多。第一，地方官廳在商民的心目中信用最壞，地方官廳籌資開設，必出於強迫手段。第二，地方官廳開設的金融機關，往往成為財政上籌欵的一種工具，在今日地方財政普遍人不敷出的情形之下，實至危險，恐信用不能確立，反足以擾亂金融。至於發行銀行股票，在都市出售，吸收大都市的資金，在票據市場未充分發達的今日，困難更多。再由國家撥欵設立，事實上更多困難。目前國家並沒有這樣大的力量與精力。所以城鄉銀行。看似簡單，實則資本問題。已屬不易解決。因為不易解決的緣故，所以近時出現了土地證券這一類的問題。事實上農村除了土地之外，再無長物。所以在農村中組織銀行，自集資本，除了以土地為基礎外，沒有旁的辦法。以土地為基礎組織銀行成另一種性質，吾人不能在此多贅。總之城鄉銀行組織的資本問題，看似簡單，實則至難解決。吾人在此亦不能作如何具體的建議，但提出幾個原則如下：</p>
<p>第一，城鄉銀行的資本，不能由地方官廳，強攤勒借而得。</p>
<p>第二，城鄉銀行的資本，應相當雄厚，不能有名無實。</p>
<p>第三，城鄉銀行的資本，不能由地方豪富一手包辦，成為私人的工具。</p>
<p>第四，城鄉銀行的資本，應具活動性質，不能以不流動的土地或不動產充當。</p>
<p>第五，城鄉銀行的資本，應盡量避免由地方官廳，直接供給。</p>
<p>二　管理問題</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，由誰管理，由何人監督，這亦是一個重要問題，此與銀行在人民方面的信用，甚有關係。就理論上言，由股東會管理，由董事會經營，由監事會監督，此似為一慣的常軌。惟是城鄉銀行，吾人既反對由少數財閥把持，則股東勢必分散。且在各地，人民知識淺陋，官廳勢力廣大，所謂城鄉銀行，事實上至易為方上的官僚地痞所操縱，因而發生種種營私舞弊敗壞信用的惡劇。所以城鄉銀行的管理問題，尤為值得研究。　於這　，吾人建議如下的原則：</p>
<p>第一，城鄉銀行的理事人，應　純粹的商業人材，絕　禁止其與官廠發生關係，並不准其和睚营同類事業。</p>
<p>第二，城鄉銀行的營　內容，應　　公　，逐月公布，絕　避免機密行動。城鄉銀行為地方公共銀行，營　政策無秘密必要。</p>
<p>第三，不論理事會股東會或監事會，應絕對避免與地方官廳發生直接的關係。除受法律的監督外，與地方官廳不生關節。</p>
<p>第四，關於營業政策，受財政部或全國經濟委員會之直接監督。其營業情形亦應逐月向財部及全國經濟委員會呈報。</p>
<p>上述各點，在保障城鄉銀行純為經濟方面的組織，絕對拒絕政治的或財政勢力的侵入。蓋地方財政與地方銀行關係不健全所產生的惡果，在我國已有豐富的經驗，今後除採決絕的政策外，不能保障此種銀行的安全。</p>
<p>三　營業問題</p>
<p>城鄉銀行經營何種業務。這是吾人討論城鄉銀行問題的中心題目。城鄉銀行的設立，假如只在替中央或地方政府推銷公債，經售航空獎券，甚或經徵稅欵以至於為政府墊借欵項那吾人敢斷言牠將變成一種剝削的工具，對於農村不但沒有好處，並且將加速其崩潰。像這樣的城鄉銀行，吾人不希望其組織。中國在過去，關於農，工，商，實業，國貨等設了不少的銀行，但結果名實不符，大家都走上公債買賣的道路。產業終於沒有人過問。這事大家想來總看夠了。所以，我們的城鄉銀行，應該改頭換面，從實事求是方面去做。不准再幹掛羊頭賣狗肉的勾當。關於這方面，吾人提出如下的原則：</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，應該經營純經濟的業務，不代銷公債，不代售獎券，不參加一切投機事業。</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，應是都市資金與農村資金融通的橋樑。牠的本身，向國家銀行或一般商業銀行融通欵項，流入農村，切切實實做資金歸農的工作，充作都市銀行投資農村的代理人。</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，應成為農村事業活動的指導者。牠依經濟的原則，援助某一區域之內經濟條件最有利的事業的發展。牠本身領導農村，實　國家一部分的經濟政策。</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，本身為合作計的後盾，他的放欵，應以合作社為主要對象。對於地方紳士豪劣備作不正當用途的主要對象。對於地方紳士豪劣備作不正當用途的借欵，應一概拒絕。同時應運用力量，援助農村中的其他金融機關。對於典當業，以及小錢莊等，應予以實力的援助。</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，自身應鞏固信用，排開一切惡劣勢力的侵入，俾為地方上資金流集的總匯，藉以轉換資金逃入都市的風氣。對於存欵與小額儲蓄，應與具體的保障，使人們對於本土的金融機關，具有信心，資金自能逗留於本地範圍之內。</p>
<p>四　與國家銀行的關係問題</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，不應與各地地方銀和地——省銀行，發生關系，就吾人當前的事實，在許多省銀行中，要找到一個健全的銀行，簡直踏破芒鞋，難得一家。所以城鄉銀行，就直接與國家銀行聯絡。牠的本身，就是國家指揮農村金融活動的代身。國家銀行可以使用他施行低利政策，壓迫農村中的高利貸。國家銀行可以對牠擴大信用，刺激內地的物價，以謀都市與農村物價的平衡。國家銀行可以利用他的活動，轉變資金流動的方向，以實現國家的經濟政策。所以吾人之見，城鄉銀行，應受國家銀行的直接支配，成為國家銀行資本運用的支站。</p>
<p>五　組織的單位問題</p>
<p>城鄉銀行，應依經濟的環境而組織，牠所包括的區域，應以經濟的單位為基礎，絕對不必和政治的壓迫相同。因為牠是經濟方面的組織，不是政治上的機關。且可因地方的特殊經濟環境，組織特殊的城鄉銀行。其形式，其範圍，其力量，可隨當地經濟上的情形而變通，不必拘其一致。各地情形不同，絕不能強各地　採用相同的方式。至其資本力量，尤應視當地經濟發達的情形而定。　所範圍，似不應太小。範圍太小，則尚不夠一錢莊之活動，自無設立銀行必要。總有之，關於場面鄉銀行設立的單位問題，吾人認為應遵如下的原則。</p>
<p>城鄉區域，應以經濟環境為基礎，不必與政治範圍相合。　求經濟上自成，活動的單位，不問其他。</p>
<p>所謂城鄉，範圍不應太小，範圍太小則銀行力量薄弱，反覺無能為力。</p>
<p>關於組織，可隨地方特殊的經濟環境而改變，不必拘泥全國均採同一形式。</p>
<p>六　保障問題</p>
<p>辦地方金融事業最困難的一點，就是地方政治的摧殘。軍閥的蹂躪，地方財政當局的勒借，是內地金融破產的主要原因。現在要組織城鄉銀行。要希望他盡他本身的使命，吾人便先要討論保障的問題。國家應以明令，嚴禁地方財政當局與此類銀行發生關係。此類銀行，應嚴格確定其為超政治的組織。任何政府機關，不能強其承受債票，不能向其強借欵項。凡因政治問題而發生債票，不能向其強借欵項。凡因政治問題而發生的損失，國家應直接負其責任。蓋銀行營業，以信用為基礎，信用損壞，則一切活動均無從進行。所以關於銀行信用的保障，為使這種制度健全發展的先決條件。而保障的妥善辦法，莫如隔絕此種銀行與地方財政的關係。吾人前所建議，其大部分目的即在此點。</p>

<p>一個人假使沒有相當的能力上的儲藏和凖備，他在人生的戰鬥中，一定會遇到失敗的命運的。</p>
<p>年靑的人性情剛强，沒有畏縮性，所以，他們的感情，是容易衝動，膽子是大的，他們能够勇往直前，不顧一切地貫澈他們的主張，不惜任何犧牲，中年的人世故漸深，壯氣也消了，但他們却富有遇事的觀察力和判斷力，理智和情感，同時高張，所以，這兩者間，假使能得到有適富的調和，那末是如何偉大的一種力量呀！</p>

<p>戰敗法軍於諒山之老將丁槐，時在前淸光緒十年間（甲申之役，）迄今已垂五十二載，知共名者殊尠，前見報刋有『國府褒恤』之令，悉已於去歲六月二十四日下午，在平逝世矣，享年九十七歲，負一代英名之老將，是不可以不記。</p>
<p>溯法軍之攻諒山時，太平軍故將劉永福，方受淸廷招撫，以都督記名：越南之宣光興化山西三省，皆由劉克復，未幾，而諒山被擾，則蘇元春潘鼎新等，力戰不能守，幸丁行間，遂有小南關之捷；人但聞提督馮子材輩奮死不顧，而不知八日夜郤敵二百餘里，丁固與有力焉。</p>
<p>丁爲滇西鶴慶縣人，當杜文秀之亂作，滇督岑毓英募兵平之：丁猶年少，困於飢寒，始入其麾下。岑以爲可用，旋得任騰越鎭總戎，又任古州鈸，卒得遷擢督師江南，嗣爲臺諫所劾而去；解職里居時，瓶紡織於某所，以折閱而止。迨李經羲至滇，乃得爲團練會辦。復因鹽斤加價，爲輿誦所不滿，排擠以去。後岑春萱在桂，以左江鎭保荐，不久，又擢提督，兼任龍州督辦。直至民元前一年，又因案削職，沈淪鄂渚，自是宦海中，遂不復聞共名。</p>
<p>在鄂，爲制軍陳虁龍所知，以某事飭江漢關道査辦。丁大窘，嗣得援？始邀倖免：武漢起義，不得已，率眷浮江，棲息滬壖。詎民元五月間。在靜安寺畔，被寃家於夜分潛入其室，殺其子與媳，猶未慊，且縱火焚其家。丁遂北遷，忽忽又二十餘年。茲聞其怛然奄化，而百歲殘齡之老將，得稽其勳績，垂諸令典，丁亦猶有榮焉。</p>

<p>凡蓄鳥者，必美飾其籠，雖一釣之微，亦必窮極工巧；有所謂忠明鈎者，允爲名貴。忠明，徐姓，鄂產，索習錯刀業，後來滬，改業雕紫銅籠鈎，共雕鑿之細，世無其匹，見之者，無不疑爲鬼斧神工也。所雕有字有畫，且欵識俱備，更區別文武。如紂眼芙蓉，則爲文鳥，其籠爲文鈎，文鈎所雕，無非西廂紅樓等類，至若黃頭等善鬥之鳥，則鈎雕三國武事，從不混淆也。一釣之値，本定三十六金，然忠明嗜麴蘖，日在醉鄉，罕事工作，雕未及半，已付質庫，烏主人亟欲得鈎，代爲一贖之，然贖又質，質而再贖，及工成到手，輒耗費在百金左右。故今市上有以忠明鈞割愛者，代價亦非百金不可，或須二百餘金，今忠明尙存，惟以目力過耗，己茫茫不復覩物。有見之於豫園者，謂赤鼻傴僂，頹然一老矣。聞其婿某能繼其業，婿某本在旱烟筒店專鑿筒頭細花，忠明見其技之可取，乃以女妻之。且一經指授，鑿鈞亦楚楚可觀云。</p>

<p>— 笙梧</p>
<p>舊元實的晚上，同與樓有南社紀念會的聚餐會，參加的人士很多爲文紀載，所述都係雋聞逸事，弈弈動人。筆者見此，也不免　癢，因而掇拾一些見聞，聊作春秋補白。彼日席間，當柳亞子先生致詞之頃，全場空氣緊張，掌聲不絕。他報告到公推蔡孑民先生爲名譽會長時，大衆更興高采烈的拍掌。末復高呼南社紀念會萬歲，到會的一百五十多人，個個起立，各乾一大盃。這時窗外正是大雪紛飛，遍地成銀裝世界，儼然爲此番盛會的奇美點綴也。</p>
<p>有人請林庚白洗生講戀愛史，他無可推却，就站出來說，「我根本上就沒有戀愛，怎得有史？」這話像是老文章里一個破題，簡捷了當。這四座的會友却來個「客氣客氣」的回聲。他看見鋒頭不對，即刻轉移目標，接下去道：「大家要知道，今年柳先生五十歲，我們今天借花獻佛，大家乾杯，向柳先生預祝壽辰吧。」果然，大家被他哄得起立，吃了一杯，但他却就如此下場了。</p>
<p>女賓中以陸禮華女士的談鋒爲最健。兩段笑話中，幾個「蓋！蓋！」引得大衆哄堂大笑。接着曾虛白先生出來，說他係常熟人，應該講兩句話，因爲陸女士的笑話，一個便是用常熟方言來講的。曾先生起來說了一句，「對格！對格！」全場又揚起了笑聲，說是「對證」過了「古本」。</p>
<p>那天到會的人士，多半是東南的健者，但也不乏北國的佳賓。座中有閻甘園老先生，講西北情形，我們親聆此老馨欬，恍若置身衰草連天，牛奔馬走的一個大收羣中間，聽說漢宮遺事。和關老　　　坐的，有一位吳半山老先坐，是杭州人，舊號木石居士，曾和他的夫人綘雲女史編印「歷代名媛詞」。筆者會見其題辭，茲摘錄一首如下：「組豪婉的各翻新，本色當行自有人。聽罷雙雙花底唱，李朱端合匹蘇辛。」蓋老人亦殊好事。時賢葉楚佾先生，即其門下快壻云。</p>
<p>胡樸安先生壯懷仍不稍减，在會中散發的「奈何曲」，極見悲歌慷慨之意。其自叙說：「昔歸玄恭作萬古愁曲，自盤古以來，人人皆可駡之人，事事皆可嗎之事，此所謂無可奈何之日也。據知世變日急，縱的可罵者，玄恭悉已罵之矣；機的可駡者，玄恭初未嘗一遇之。玄恭雖處無可奈何之日，猶有可以奈何者也；今日眞是無可奈何之無奈何矣。……」至曲詞則柳亞子先生則有「賦是同座」兩絕句，如下：「江山已落侏儒手，壇玷還尋舊日盟，忍淚佯歡吾事了，可堪扶目俟河淸。酒龍詩虎卅年前，劍胆蕭心未化烟。倘向新亭作豪語，夷吾江左我猶賢」蘊藉中殊見激昂，不愧爲騷搜的盟主。世人欲知柳氏的生平以及其晚近的懷抱者，讀此，可見一斑。</p>
<p>又其夜偕友小坐大華舞場，復有所作。贈宋寰公先生云：「垂老英雄百感傷，難馴龍性尙軒昂，金戈鐵馬遼陽夢，忍遺溫柔老此鄕？」贈任味知先生詩云：「三十五年成一瞥，撐腸芒角醉顏酡，歐刀醇酒沙場血，後死吾曹可奈何？」舞罷有紀云：「入抱織腰熨電波，玉顔微暈累嬌娥，摩挲戒體渾閒事，不信廻腸盪氣多。」有懷異域故人云：「轉綠廻黃萬涕洟，佳人天未查難期。北湖南越尋常甚，凄絕河粱蘇李詩。」熱情迸，清麗可誦。</p>
<p>胡懷琛先生也曾卽席賦詩二首如下：「春燈影裏試瓊筵，白也能在米亦顚。幾復規模存別派，永和人物備羣賢。眼中事成陳跡，席上豪情似往年。新酒舊瓶誰管得，只怠朋好不須傳。（末句借用施耐庵語，酌改一字。）簡樸渾厚，詩如其人。他本意只怠朋好，不須流傳，我現在代他公開出來，還請他莫怪。</p>

<p>「談虎色變，」虎是多麼兇猛的東西。你聽虎子的發音，虎字的形狀，雄糾糾氣昻昂，的確是英雄豪傑之流。把它加到隨便誰的頭上，都不失它的威風。虎踞，虎視，虎將等等，無不威風凛凛，不一可一世。可是，出乎意外，西京雜記載：「漢朝以玉爲虎子，以爲便器，使待中執之行幸以從。」使堂堂虎將軍，屈任溺器之名，眞倒威風！</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>富討飯，在江淮間是常見的事情。江淮人有一種迷信，父母年在八十一歲死亡，子孫必要討飯；做子孫的在這時應個景兒，求乞一百家？將來就可免去，這眞是一件迷信得可笑的事。日前富紳某家因其母死，特搬演這種活劇。一家六七口，穿着破衣，手提筐籃，魚貫似的在路上求乞。他們平時居移氣養移體弄慣的，一旦出乖露醜，面部的表情，眞是難堪到極頂。其實父母死亡與子孫窮困絲毫沒有關係，庸人自擾，江淮人迷信程度之幼稚，委實有自討其辱的意味。</p>

<h3 id="c167">我羨慕今日的少年 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 清芬</p>
<p>從我的少年時代說起　少年讀物的發展情形</p>
<p>我們只要加快一下，誰都有過一個廢寢忘餐地新聞記者小說的時期。至於小說的內容怎樣，會給與我們多少好處或多少壞處，那是無暇計及的，多半還是因爲沒有能力想到那些事。這個時期，在我是十四歲到十七歲，從初小四年級到高小三年級的那幾個年頭。那裏我寄宿在鄉間一個被農村繞著的縣立小學裏，同時寄宿在那裏的三十幾個同學，就是些同樣小說迷的少年。那裏學校裏絕對禁止看小說，而我們的都是比較開明些，知道徒然禁止是無益的；特爲指定列國志演義，三國志演義等幾種，允許我們有閒時閱讀。意思是說，除這指定的幾咱以外，是禁止閱讀的。但是誰去管它呢，只要有一個同學從家裏帶來了一種小說，就鬼鬼崇崇地立刻傳遍了全體。依著所有者感情的親疏，流轉著傳觀了去。常是看第二本的被看第一本的催逼著，看第二本的催逼著看第三本的，那一段傻勁，現在想起來就好笑。我們那裏最躭心的，怕被都是搜檢了出來；同時，也就一次次地享受著「我也看過了」的滿足和快樂－－雖然這種滿足和快樂，現在看起來，該是那麽可憐相的。</p>
<p>以後，自己在站著對學生說教了。幸虧那裏的情形已經大變，語體文代替了三方的地位，學生閱讀小說，非但不加禁阻，且相當與以誘導。許多有名的舊小說代替了「經」「傳」的地位，被介紹到少年們的案頭上去。對一垏在不該閱讀的東西，也得積極說明「不該」的理由，不再是武斷的禁止。同時外國的童話和故事等，正在絡續地了進來，穆木天譯的王爾德童話集，趙亢任譯的阿麗思漫遊記，先後出處。安徒生，格裏姆……的名字漸漸爲少年人所熟識。中國固有的民意故事和傳說，也在開始搜集和整理，林蘭編的徐文長故事等絡續在那裏出版；一方面葉紹爻先生的創作童話－－後來被搜集在「稻草人」和「古代英雄的石像」二字集子裏的－－也絡續在兒童世界上發表。接著，各書局都有寫給少年閱讀的書籍出版。世界童話之王安徒生的作品，幾乎全部被翻譯了過來；珂羅狄的木偶奇遇記，亞米契斯的愛的教育……凡是世界上的少年們應該讀和喜歡讀的名著，我們中國的少年幾乎都　有讀到的福氣。</p>
<p>可是我們的這個國家，是世界上有名的古老國家。古老國家的特色是文化歷史的悠久，和迷信怪誔的傳說故事的特多。少年們有了自由閱讀的機會，把許多有用的東西果然吞食下去，而許多迷信怪誔的神仙故事，武俠小說，也就一樣被他們所愛讀。同時新興的電影事業，專在迎合迷信怪怪誔的古老民衆的低級趣味，用了「江湖奇俠傳」那種神仙劍俠的荒謬故事，構製許多燒了一本有一本的「火燒紅蓮寺」。我們都街道電影對於人類－－尤其是心地純潔，意志非常薄弱的少年－－生活的暗示勢力和教育作用是很千真萬確的。讀了那些小說，再拿這些電影來印證，給與少年人的影響，遠非學校的教育能力所能及。而國際風雲的險惡，國家情勢的危岌，少年人從學校的壁報上看得一點消息，從都是的口頭上聽得一點危言；巴不得有那麽一日：煉劍成功，得道回來，祇須輕描淡寫地來一下，把個只有強權，不講僅是的世界，改造成美夢一般的仙鄉。</p>
<p>這結果，許多不幸的事因此發生，長沙有三個同一小學的十四五歲的少年失蹤了，他們除在家裏拿了點錢，還留著個水牛，說是上四川峨嵋山導師傅學道去了。經過家長的驚惶和忙亂，才把這三位寶貝從漢口上四川去的輪船碼頭上找了回去。同時，武昌和廣州也有同樣的事情發生，曾在新聞紙上大大地記載進。我有一位十六歲的徒弟，在商店裏學生意；平時很喜歡讀小說，從前年起就摒絕暈腥，實行素食。去年舊曆的元旦，店中同事都趁著放假去玩，他却日頭積雪和冷雨，上城外十餘裏的香爐峯嶺的觀音殿去燒香。看他的行逕，也已走上了修煉的道兒。</p>
<p>由於這些着魔一般的事實，曾經引起教育當局的憂慮，和教育家的大聲疾呼，對少年讀物起來作清除和消毒的運動。從來都是的失於指導，家長的忽於注意，和社教機關的勇於溺職，經這事實的刺激，給了他們　反省的機會。經過各方面的努力，才算把少年們從毒氛和魔道中解救了出來。這僅僅是二三年前的事。所以少年讀物從自由發展以來，也曾經過這麽一個黑暗時期。</p>
<p>從來對於少年讀物的觀念，有著一種不可饒恕的錯誤。以爲少年讀物的整個形相是屬於文學的：所以描寫的題材是文學的，寫作的任務是文藝作家的。把少年讀物引離得人生遠遠，好像少年就該永遠生活在非現實的詩國裏；轉把天天團結著他們的實際現象和生活常識，忽略得幹幹淨淨。這結果，除把少年們養成避免現實的夢幻追求者外，再沒有了解人生，改善生活的企圖。</p>
<p>把解釋人生意義的社會科學和探究生活現象的自然科學，加以適切的編織，趣味的描繪，原原本本地寫成少年人閱讀的專書，只是近來才有的事。那位第一個企圖這種工作的人，對於全世界少年的恩惠，我想應該不在發明「教育」這個名詞的人之下吧。可惜在這個什麽都落後的古老國家裏，還不大容易找得出這種新鮮的少年讀物來。</p>
<p>最近，開明書店的「新少年」出版，看它的主旨，在教少年們「認識社會，欣賞文藝，了解自然。」正在企圖着把社會科學和自然科學，也和文藝同樣重要地介紹給少年讀者。讀了它的創刊號，也正在切切實實地從這三方面做去。這才使我回憶起自己少年時代的可憐相，而羨慕着生活在今日的少年。我們的少年時代雖是過去了，但還有我們的弟妹兒女在。我們都該回憶一下自己少年時代的可憐相，我們都受不到的，由我們的弟妹兒女來補償一下。人類就是這樣進步來的。我們就不着替過去的自己悲哀。</p>
<p>我現在感激得快要流下淚來，再也沒有功夫把「新少年」的優點和別的什麽希望寫下，留着讓別人說吧。</p>
<h3 id="c168">讀「新少年」創刊號　其一 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 王天休</p>
<p>最近在開明書店裏買到一本「新少年」的創刊號；大概他自有一種引人的力量吧，我是始終持續着一股濃濃的意趣，一口氣把他看完了。</p>
<p>我不敢隨便斷定國內所有的少年刊物，全趕不上才隨地的「新少年」，但至少得說，他應是近來來國內少年刊物中，比較夠得上被譽爲優秀的刊物。他在一大戴盆望天粗製濫造的少年讀物中，是顯得活躍多哪。</p>
<p>空空洞洞的恭維或譴責，都足以混濛事實，使本揣的價值，失却公正的估量。爲此，下文該從速就「新少年」創刊號的本身，依實說話。</p>
<p>質與量的均衡編配，是他明顯的一個優點，應道德提出。創刊號的「編輯後記」中，有這麽幾句：「……本刊的使命在教少年們（一）認識社會（二）欣賞文藝（三）了解自然……」我想，一般對少年們負有教育責任的，對此三點，許是不致有什麽非議或偏重某一眯的主張吧？而可喜的就在編者能支用這三點作編輯方針。分析創刊號裏的作品，社會科學方面有「少年閱報室」「黃河之水天上來」等四篇；自然科學方面有「月的話」「看的秘密」以及科學新消息等十二篇；文藝方面　有「鳥言獸語」「少年印刷工」等六籍。雖然各個門類的篇數並不相近，但就各門類的篇幅計算，却統配得十分勻稱，這點可以證明編者並不偏重某一門類，他們是看出現代少年所需要的精神上的「維他命」，給一樣一樣適量地配合起來，做成這麽一份可口的富有營養性的「精神糧食」，送給少年們，這是「新少年」創刊號的成功。</p>
<p>其次，寫作技術的恰當，也是這個刊物的優點。稍有寫作經驗的人大概全明白：寫一篇供給少年或兒童閱讀的作品，並不像一般人所想像的那麽容易；因爲他也少不了要有心理學上的根據，或少年生活的實際觀察和體驗，甚至一字一辭的挑剔，語句的綴合，全得適應他們的想像力理解力和趣味中心。創刊號裏，像葉聖陶的「鳥言獸語」丰子愷的「小鈔票歷險記」，這兩籍童話，在兒童文學的創作技巧上，全是十分圓熟的，人鬫丟潛心閱讀，而不惜把一顆天真的小心投入作品裏去，跟作品裏的人物發生情感的。茅盾的「少年印刷工」是長篇連載小說，現在祇看到開端，不容易談起。葉聖陶不僅是文壇上早已享有盛名的作家，我想像他一定同時又是學校中優良的作文教師，他著的「文心」，早受到多數初中學生的歡迎。他在這冊創刊號裏，寫下一篇「文章展覽」，物寺提出朱自清的一篇小品文，題目叫作「背景」的，他在文後附着一段二千多字的指導的話，那種誠摯的，不憚煩絮的說明指示，我信決不致使一個愛好文藝的少年感到厭倦的。這種偏重文藝本質上的親切指導，在初解文藝的少年是必要的。自然社會科學方面的作品。多少得偏重一點說理，但最好能避免說教式演講式的寫作法。創刊號中自然社會科學方面作品，多數還夠得上說平易輕快，多少含幾分趣味性。而且編撰者很善於利用時伶　時事以及切近少年生活的事物，採作研究的題材。從時事方面採取題材的，就有丁曉先的「黃河之水天上來」，說明黃災的根原和整治的根本方法；宋易的「月的話」，套了安徒生童話「月的話」的方式，解釋報紙上所載今年有兩次月食和英國天文學家琴斯氏預測月球行將分裂說的消息，諸如此類的常識題材很能適應少年們的好奇心理的。</p>
<p>缺點並非沒有，只是不多也不致損失大體。譬如創刊號中的歷史故事「擊築悲歌」，寫來雖也不十分壞，而且很含蓄一處激發氣質的力量，但歷史故事的欣賞，最好先得瞭解當時的社會背景，才容易深切地領略。少年們是否多數具有比較充分的史地知識，是疑問；歷史故事對於少年們的感染力究有多少，當然也是個疑問。如能把這些篇幅載一篇接近少年現實生活的短小說，也許更動目一點。對面紙似嫌薄了些，最好還能利用對面封裏，選印些值得低沈的繪畫或攝影，我想這些也該是少年讀者所愛好的吧？</p>
<p>「我們要暢適地發展，把捉住光榮的將來！我們要通順地前進，歸到那汪洋的大海！」這是「新少年」創刊號卷頭言中的一節歌詞。我也正是這麽期望着這份生氣蓬勃的少年刊物。</p>
<p>王天休先生提到歷史故事，我們似乎應該說幾名話。</p>
<p>「新少年」裏登載這類歷史故事（或稱歷史小品）的目的有三：一，把呆板的歷史故事寫得活動一點，希望能夠引起少年們閱讀歷史書的興趣；說得誇張點，希望能夠引起少年們研究歷史的興趣。二。希望少年們能免得到一點「教科書」以外的歷史知識。三、希望少年們能夠在這類歷史故事裏去瞭解當時社會背景。</p>
<p>說到第三點，我們的見解剛剛和王先生相反：王先生以爲「先得瞭解當時的社會背景，才容易深切地領略，」我們則以爲要從這一類歷史故事裏去瞭解當時的社會背景。</p>
<p>我們以爲一篇歷史故事如果寫來不能使少年們深切地領略，那是取材上或技術上的失敗，並不是因爲歷史硌不切近現實生活，就減少了它的「對於少年們的感染力」。</p>
<p>我們感謝王先生的熱情的指導和批評，同時我們還願意聽取其他讀者的意見。</p>

<p>— 清水</p>
<p>「兒童年」滑過了幾個月，靜情無聲的再不見誰在呐喊了。單是爲兒童的「精神糧食」而出的好寗報，好刊物，幾月來就無動無靜的不風了得有薹何興趣。只會「喊」不會「做」，這樣的「兒童年」莫說時間是一年，就是把它延長至十年亦沒有用處，能夠給日處惡劣環境時受惡劣教育的冶陶，不良讀物的迷津的可憐的孩子以解救麽？有，一點都不能夠的。然而，在道幾月來的　悶與失望的當中，我們高興地在一月十日讀到開膽書店出版的「新少年」半月刊，這是給兒童們，小學生們閱讀的一份一般的刊物，大小跟前此商務出刊的「少年」（月刊）差不多，內容卻大大地進步；比之同時代坊間　售的兒童雜誌，一樣是陽便於兒童閱讀而且也是最有益於兒童的「心身的的修養」跟「學術的修養」的一份刊物。我雖是童年已過，但當它到了我的手上時，感於內容的充裕，文字的明暢，一口氣把它讀下去了。這麽好的兒童刊物，是很少看見的，－－至少我個人的感覺如此。</p>
<p>我們就「創刊號」的內容數數看吧。少年閱報室咧，童話咧，科學特寫與實驗咧，天文故事咧，美術故事咧，文章展覽咧，科學世界咧，……這一門門的文字，都是每一個兒童或少年所應當讀的。每一門的文字，都是以兒童或少年的心理與意境來寫成的怪明暢導活潑的易於閱讀爾於閱讀的活的篇章。不獨童話故事是如盯，新聞，科學也是一樣的容易上口，絕無晦澀　臘之弊。這麽彷彿兒童自己寫成的刊物，求之十年前－－甚至說是五年前－－是不能夠得着的。我們從前讀房龍的「人的故事」提，痛恨在國內找不到一本大衆化有趣化的科學書來讀，幾於要改變國籍去做外國人。現在讀了「新少年」，又以出世太早，痛恨黃金時代的童年，享受不到這麽一份滋養豐富的易於吞嚥易於消化的刊物。</p>
<p>說得實際些時，這裏面的文字，大半是名家專門學者的手筆，好，是當然的。關於文藝與彷彿完全是文藝的，「鳥言獸語」，「小鈔票歷險記」，「擊築悲歌」，「少年印刷工」，要算最可注意的有思想有內容有力量的幾篇作品了。「鳥言獸語」的時代遞增非常清楚，弦外之音，冷雋可味，是童話，亦是小說，也可是寓言主。在許許多多聖陶先生的童話作品中，我以爲這是一篇最能夠啃住目前的動蕩時代的現實而寫成的傑作！這麽一篇好文章，敬希大家留心閱讀，不要經輕易放過。「擊築悲歌」，故事是舊的，但裝上民族的意識，使之以新的姿態，新的靈魂重現出來，以給孩子們閱讀；這悲壯激昂，足資感發的歷史硌，在此國難壘積發氣銷沉的今朝，也是很有裨益的一帖興奮劑。豐子愷的「賀年」，把關於美術的文章，寫得流利動人，活像一篇故事，抓上了手就非一口氣把它讀下去不可，也可說是一篇好作品。其他的科學文字，像顧均正，賈祖璋，金仲華，縈非諸人的作品，文出專家，一樣的成熟吸性最大，使你讀了感着異樣的輕鬆與愉快。</p>
<p>末了，我還要這麽鄭重的說，「兒童年」雖同冷靜地滑過了幾個月，但有了這份「新少年」，總算有點貢獻的不是白過的了。我希望「新少年」負起解救孩子的責任，仙鶴充實，姿態研新的按期出版，永常地以這份好的糧食美的聖餐給孩子們盡量享用！我更希望一切的孩子們，接受這一份於你們最爲有益的糧食與聖餐，而誠摯地不絕地去享用……</p>
<h3 id="c170">其三 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭叔訥</p>
<p>煦和的陽光拾去天邊的凍色，春神降臨人間了：這充滿着光榮的將來底生機！「新少年」，我們將歡欣地瞧着它抽出柔美的枝條，生出鮮綠的葉，開放出絢爛的花兒：生命盡充盈於我們的園中了啊！</p>
<p>我和影影共拿着一本「新少年」創刊號，隨手翻看到聖陶先生的「鳥言獸語」，順著樸素的情緒閱讀下去：作者純樸的描寫，給我以深沉的陶醉！看吧：「那銅像雕的是一個騎馬的人，頭戴軍盔，兩撇鬍子向上壘起，一副不可一世的氣概。麻雀說：「這時百甚麽玩意呢？我們看看吧」。說，就停在那銅像的軍盔上。鬆鼠很靈活地爬上那銅像的身軀，直至右面的鬍子的部分才歇腳，他把一條尾巴也向上壘起，從下面望去，只覺得那銅像在修鬍子的時候少刮了一刀。」。這種頑皮的天真的敘述，十分具有孩子般的精神，衆這上面找到真詩的要素；我沉浸於這詩的美里，感到異常的輕鬆！它雖然蘊含著兒童的默想，却是針對現實社會的認示。它給我們喚出了一般封建遺物的　育家形相，並指點給我們：「（麻雀說）：「昨天我出去遊散，飛到那位教育家的　前，看見他正在低着頭寫文章。……原來他在言論人類的小學教科書，說一般小學教科書往往記載着鳥言獸語，讓小學生和鳥獸作伴，……必然弄得思想不清楚，行爲不正當，同和‘鳥獸沒有分別。」」但是「人類和我們作伴，就砂岩辱沒了他們嗎？我們的思想，就特別不清楚，行爲就特別不正當嗎？他們的思想就沒有不清楚，行爲就沒有不正當嗎？」你瞧！這譏刺是何乖地尖利！我已不覺任教所表現的童話藝術，帶有詩真純，却滿含着對於人類的憐與憎惡！讓鬆鼠嘲罵嗎：「人類真是又糊塗又傲慢的東西！」因爲人類的卑劣與殘酷，已給他們做了有力的例證。凡「市政府一件事項，在沒有找到例證之前，就下判斷，叫做武斷；這是不很妥當的。」作者一再懇切的提示着：「我們要找例證」。甚麽事情都得切實考察，才能夠長進智識，增加經驗」。正是給少年們一個極好的教訓。</p>
<p>子愷先生的「小鈔票曆險記」，具備同樣的意義。故事是朱榮生在學校中，拾着一張鈔票，他費去許多的心計把它收藏起來；後來回去交給他的媽媽，以備買夜飯米，但媽媽告訴他：「阿榮！這一定是你的同學失落的，你應該交給先生，歸還失主，我們怎麽可以用呢？」委婉的語句，調和了莊嚴的思想，讀之令人憧憬於母愛的純潔！</p>
<p>茅盾先生的「小年印刷工」，雖只是故事的開端，但關於主人公趙元生的真率的敘述，尤其是心理描寫，者陽予讀者以不可磨滅的深刻印象。當他的回冊「周家福一腳踏在包車上」，吹着口哨喚過趙元生來到車旁時，卻又「伸出一個中指來在趙元生臉上，幌了一幌，狂笑着叫道：「沒有什麽－－請你吃－－哈哈！」趙元生臉上突然一紅，便又轉白。」一個富家少年的潑賴，和一個貧苦子弟受到揶揄後內心所起的羞慚神情，顯然的擺明在我們的目前，形成了兩咱不同的社會層的對立！當週家實叫車夫打開書包，送給趙元生東西時，「就在車夫面前受人家的東西麽？死也不要的！」趙元生心里猛可地這樣想著，臉上就飛紅了。」但，在現社會條件沒有根本改造以前，這樣矛盾的心理現象，誰都難免。也許這就是故事進展的關鍵。</p>
<p>宋雲彬先生的「擊築悲歌」，是寫的荊軻刺秦王的史事。作者運用「史眼」，和敏捷的手法，截取荊軻凖備動身到秦國去的一段情形，渲染上現代精神，變換成一篇新的創作。對一歷史人物的個性描繪，最爲細膩；而無半點誇張。像：「「太子如果這樣待我，那我殺秦王就像殺一只狗！」狗屠甲很興奮地說」「「見秦王時，只當見一只狗，那就不會慌張了」。屠夫甲笑着說」。刻畫出一個殺狗屠夫的粗笨形態，異常生動！又如：「現在時局十分嚴重……田先生在這個時候死去，總是眼時局有關的。」能這麽設身處地地替古人着想，用悲壯的筆調來描繪當時的緊張情形，寫來有聲有色。在這民氣銷沉的時候，我認爲確是少年們一服刺激劑。</p>
<p>在故事裏摻入美術原理，子愷先生的「賀年」，對於藝術的鑒賞，實有莫大的助力。聖陶先生的「文章展覽」，對名作加以精密剖析，從中知文藝作品的構成原理。綜合敘述人類的活動，有金仲華先生的「世界的動力」。解釋自然現象和它的因果關係，有宋易先生的「月的話」，丁曉先生的「黃河之水天上來」。他如均正先生的「飛行紀錄機」與「看的秘密」，把科學理論融化在文學的爐火中，得以輕靈曼妙的姿態出現，却沒有「歪曲」了事實。賈祖璋先生的「南極的主人翁－－企鵝」，和克士先生的「徘徊在歧路上的動物」，都是科學小品的傑作。外外，「少年閱報室」系統地將半月來的時事水牛，扼要地報告給我們，簡明可喜。</p>
<p>的確！「新少年」內容是極充實的。我要肯定這是一九三六年最悅當的少年讀物！</p>
<h3 id="c171">我所希望於「新少年」者 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 陳起義</p>
<p>要能「欣賞文藝，了解自然，認識社會。」真不是件容易的事。然而我們生長在這個時代，對於這些有關於實生活的知識，却不可不懂得。故無論如何艱難，我們還須拚命設法來啓發自己的認識。不過，單是靠我們自己演習總不大好，還要靠先進者也負起指導的責任。這麽一來，方能使演習期中的我們不致於爲一些錯誤的見解所迷惑，而陷入危險的境地裏去。</p>
<p>以嶄新的姿態而出現的「新少年」，可說便是適合我們這一處需要而産生的。我讀了創刊號之後，非常滿意，因爲這樣的少年讀物不能不算是前進的。近來「新少年社」在徵求讀者意見，便把我對於「新少年」的希望，寫了下來：</p>
<p>（一）在創刊號裏，我覺得關於自然科學的文章太多，雖然自然科學也是很重要的，而作品又寫得非常通俗有趣，沒有一點枯澀。但我希望頂好能夠每期都力求「文藝」「社會科學」，「自然科學」三種文章的量的平均，避免偏重於那一門學科。</p>
<p>（二）對於各種學科的研究方法希望「新少年」能夠多登載些。因爲有目的學習是有極大的危險的，而這種文章則何異是那探索門逕的敲門磚。此外，如果可能的話，頂好爲讀者長期解答種種疑問。</p>
<p>（三）在這個時候，凡是已經醒悟過來的人，沒有不關心於當前時局的動問的。故活的時事問題，極需要加以研究。希望「新少年」也能顧到這一點，對於當前時事動向，多加以精細的分析與研究。</p>
<p>這三點都是我對於「新少年」改進的意見。</p>
<p>最後的一點，便是希望「新少年」的編者先生們，能負起責任來幹，指導少年們走上新的途逕。一方面更要力求刊物內容的充裕，使這「新少年」成爲廣大的少年群的永恒的朋友！</p>
<p>這些便是我目前對於「新少年」的希望。</p>

<p>出賣血液來維持生活，這情形的確是可悲的。然現社會除却極少數不勞而獲的寄生份子，大部分人都是靠出買腦力或勞力來度日的。出賣腦力或勞力，也是一件苦事。但是還有一羣有腦力或勞力出賈而找不到雇主的，他們的處境，更覺困苦萬倍，被擯在生活圈外，啼飢號寒，與生活的惡魔掙扎。因是一班失業渚，他們的渴望工作，眞如餓犬尋食一樣的慌急。只要有飯吃，不論何項艱困的職務，就是會幹掉自己的生命，也無不願意擔當。出賣血液，自是很可憐的。血液是養命的泉源，是人體中最不能缺少的寳物。我們每日吸收營養料，爲的便是要補充血液。那個願意把血液出賣？然不出賣又將怎樣？餓肚子是比抽血還要難過，雖則出賣血液所得的代價，至多也只够維持數天的生活。</p>
<p>聽說外國就有專門給人抽血的血液出賈者。不過這只限於一種身體特別强壯的人，卽使抽血，也不會妨害他們的健康。我國近來各醫院，也常採用輸血治病法，故報上時見有徵求輸血人的廣吿。而每一回徵求的結果，應徵者都是紛至沓來，爭先恐後，一年前，我一位朋友的妻子，在某醫院開刀，也由醫生施用輸血的方法治療。當時前來應徵的人，共有二十幾個。後來一個拉車的車夫，算是幸運（其實是最不幸的）合格，餘的都很失望的回去。血液一抽就是五〇〇〇〇，代價是十五元。醫生吩咐他回去要多吃點菠菜和猪肝，養養身體，並須休息三五天，才不妨害健康。他却怎樣回答呢？他說謝謝你們的好意，實在說，猪肝我吃不起。一家四口，這十五塊錢，我非儉用省吃，至少維持兩三個月的生活，是免不了要再受餓的。</p>
<p>他們是要錢不要命嗎？</p>

<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>今天，又是一個毒烈的日子呦！站在觀音橋那一頭的街口，望着緊藏在東山後面的太陽，心里捏一把冷汗。但是在預定的行程里，今天，傍晚的時候，是需耍歇在松坎鎭的。</p>
<p>—走喔，不早了，日頭已過山頭啦！伕頭喊着，粗啞的喉嚨像破鑼一樣。</p>
<p>—上脚十五里，到大田角呵！</p>
<p>十五里，在漫無邊際的山田問簡直不算一回事的，伕子的健壯的脚腿那樣快，不經意的瞬息間，到了。那正是川黔兩省交界的地點吶！</p>
<p>省界，怎樣劃分的？有什麽明顯的記號？我不淸楚，只覺得在軍士的衣裝上有少許的不同。人，不還是那樣的纒着頭麽？口音，依然的夾雜着川省的土語呢。</p>
<p>—吃糍粑，來，這里的糍把是有名的。小劉慫恿我，從杆上把我拉下來。</p>
<p>糍紦的主要成分，是糯米粉和一些黃米粉的混合產物。一個破了三塊的鐵平爐，貼烤着三四個。老板娘，是四十以外的人了，風霜加深了他額角的皺紋，這意外的生意，掀起了她的驚喜。把杆外的油布簾拉下來，坐上去，讓心情靜止著，默念那雨聲的音奏。</p>
<p>酒店鎭，飽一回腸子，看看，雨停了，烏雲還壓着四外的山頭。張伕頭擠過來說——前面，還得當心呵！</p>
<p>昨夜的暗影，立時的又浮在腦子上。不是麽，四野是如此的靜穆，連馱東西的驢子的鈴聲都聽不見，到那里去喊救應呢？</p>
<p>—老張，前面也像九盤子一樣的險要麽？</p>
<p>他笑了，那神氣簡直異乎尋常，搖着手，頭隨若腰彎下去。他吿訴我們，黔省正努力於公路的建設，沿山開炸的時候，許多猴猻凄慘的呌號逃亡是使人不忍卒睹的。</p>
<p>走着，走着，在羊腸的曲徑上，慢慢地直達新聞關還沒有正式吿成的大道。路面並不平，黃泥和小碎石子平舖在整個的路上。兩後，泥是寧滑的，從草鞋的邊上溢進腳底，腿更重了。</p>
<p>—拍，拍，拍，拍，……淸脆的，輪子在山石上擊著，震撼著那沉悶的空氣，跟著—轟一聲，仿佛有什麽東西滑下來的樣子，嘩啦啦地一陣響。</p>
<p>—聽見吧，這是築路的開山工作呵！老張說！再拐過前面的山角，有造好的一頂橋，就在靠着橋的那一頭！他的手指劃着方向。</p>
<p>站在橋頭上，底下，假使以尺寸估計的話，該有二丈的光景，水，打着廻旋，在石頭上擊出了浪花，擁抱着，向下流急急的捲去。</p>
<p>—當心呵！抓緊：那右面的山嵯，雨後的泥把滑，不要跌進了坡不呀！三個伕頭急得什麽似的，再三的警吿着，額上暴跳了靑筋。</p>
<p>眞的，這兩三丈的路程是一個生與死交戰的關頭，寬處僅僅地能容單身的客人來往，邊上，沒有遮攔，右手的山頭那麼高，小猴子輕巧的跟隨了轟炸的聲浪在上面跑。但你不能看，說不定在一瞥中會喪失了你的生命，左面更不必提，壁立的形勢，會使你的腿發軟。</p>
<p>花籃槓，挑子，…謹愼的過去了，我們呢，爬吧，抓吧，咬緊了嘴唇，把恐懼的心情壓在底下，心跳，耳朶轟轟地呌，渾身的血液急劇的交流。看着，差不多都過來了，只剩老鐵緊押着那頂轎子正在步入了口子上。轎子里，有一位年長的老人，茫然的睡去了。</p>
<p>—慢慢，不要過呀，工役看着已經點燒的火頭，拚命的嚷可是晚了，鐵，他們已走在三分之一的地力。回去麼？退路是更難走的，辦不到。</p>
<p>藥炸了，上面的石塊雨似的滾動，那一塊最大的看上去是準落在轎頂上了。利劍貫穿了許多個心，用手緊緊地蓋着眼睛，不願意這可怕的慘象跳進了眼球。</p>
<p>該多徼倖呵，那石塊擦着轎子的一角滾下去，轎子，連連的搖幌了幾下，沒有跌進了深淵，這，該歸功於伕子的健壯嚇！</p>
<p>吐一口憋悶的氣，我們討劃着犒勞的辦法，在今夜的落棧地方。</p>
<h3 id="c174">書禮之家 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>交了春，天氣依然是那麽冷：風像野獸似地撲過田野，撲過莊稼，撲過死沉沉的小市鎭。</p>
<p>田野裏，荒凉得像古舊的荒塚；幾簇宿年的稻稈縱錯地倒在乾裂的地面上——那地面，在過去的旺盛的時代，是也曾潤濕着它們主人底勞動的汗液，與希望的笑駡的：「他媽的，瞧瞧這土地吧，油光光的，簡實好做餑餑兒吃」！——可是現在，一切都成了過去的輕夢。希望的，勞動的汗液已經被吸盡了，而人們，也正像被冬日的霜雪所侵蝕的稻桿子，枯萎了，倒下了，在銳冷的北風裏，在荒蕪而乾裂的地面上。…</p>
<p>過去的已經過去了！崇仁二太爺，抖縮着裹在一件記不淸已經有多少年代了的破棉袍裏面的乾瘦的身子，沿了通向小市鎭去的那條半開築的公路走着的時候，一種說不出的難受的感傷在陰沈的陽光中不斷地起着作用；這作用，又不斷地激起着一些懷舊的凄凉，一些沒落的，凋零的悲哀，與另外的一些莫名的憤恨與嗟嘆：「好的時候已經遠遠地過去了，現在是……現在是……輪到我們來受苦了。讀書人！喝！也算是書香門第啊。現在——祖上造了什麼孽唔！」</p>
<p>是一種恥辱啊！這恥辱，無休止地祗是像冷雨一樣的打在他心上：三十年前，自己的門第不是依然是那麽光輝顯赫的嗎？崇仁二太爺！說出去這一塊小小的地方中，還有誰不知道呢。祖父是一位狀元爺，父親放過兩任道台，而自己呢，又是受過了國家的「恩典」的，年紀輕輕的就中了舉，也是一個「晉紳」啊</p>
<p>也可以說是「顯祖耀宗」了吧？一個大大的家族，從祖上承繼下來，到了崇仁二太爺手裏，眞的又開始蓬勃地「發」起來了，買了田，起了屋子（屋子裏，還上着一方祖上傳下來的「御賜」的「狀元第」的匾額——可是現在，屋子已經給拆得一點痕跡也找不出來了，原來的那塊土地上却造起了在上海做洋貨生意而「發」了起來的暴發戶那個姓王的私宅了。而那方「御賜」的匾額呢——二太爺不敢再想起——也許已經被人劈成碎片，丟在灶肚裏做引火的材料，一片片的燒掉了。……</p>
<p>燒掉了！好的日子，跟着也像被丟進了火裏去一樣的，變成灰燼了。世界猛地變了一副樣子，人們的辮子都沒有了。於是，自家兒的聲名與顯赫，也跟着舊的世界一天天地消失了，像一個古怪的夢，像一個美麗的泡沫。</p>
<p>「祖上造了什麼孼啊？」時常那麽想。「也算是書禮之家啊，」這是一套什麼把戲呢？崇仁二太爺是始終弄不懂的。那些田，那些房子，那些從僕妻妾，那些在夢裏常常出現的過去的顯耀，過呀過的，全屬於別人了。年紀一天天地老起來，日子一天天地在出賣家產的情形中過去；現在，一切都完了，剩下自己一個垂死的軀幹，而這軀幹，又是深深地含着鴉片的精華的。</p>
<p>想不通呀！醫如說，自己的二個兒子吧！不是小的時候曾受過了「聖賢」的敎育的嗎？可是養到這麽大！喝，一個在村上弄上了一個女人，悄悄地像一溜烟那樣地，不知浪到什麼地方去了：而小的一個呢？媽的！不是去年有人從上海來，帶了那麽一個信來的嗎：「二太爺，你家的那位二少爺，在上海做了强盜，給抓在監牢吃官司去了！」</p>
<p>「這是什麽世界哪」</p>
<p>完了！一切都完了！現在的世界已經換了一副樣子！「書香子弟」，也就得那麽無聲無息的餓死了（書香子弟還做强盜？媽的！祖上造了什麽孽啊！）這是什麽世界啊！</p>
<p>想起了，自己那麽大的年紀，「舉入」出身！方才上鎭上那家帶一點親的暴發戶張家去「想一點法子」還受到了門上人的一頓呼叱！想起了這二天中間吃下肚去得僅僅的二個干饅頭，想起了連偷來的「日麵」也快斷了！走在半開築的公路上，崇仁二太爺彷彿突然地失掉了全身的均勻，一下子，就在地上蹲下去了。</p>
<p>眼前是一門漆黑，他什麽都不覺得了：覺得的，就祇是自已的「書禮之家」的過往的顯赫。</p>

<p>徐文壁開篇</p>
<p>市音（一三四〇）上午十時至十一時</p>
<p>斜桥入院峭寒生。空寂　房宝鸭湿。惜别思春春宛照。侵尊梦影够消魂。　　病起梳妆懒。中酒扶头瘦不禁。想到，昨夜燈花继报喜。但是，佳期浅淡不分明。可喜，鹦哥意重吟时涩。但是，燕子心痴诉恨频。早已是，廿四番風花寄信。只是游絲亂絮閣紗欞。曾記得遊園踏遍平無路。一種情憐刻骨深。曾記得，自在廉鈎書館靜。堂深送過打棋聲。曾記得，十三鈿柱琴挑剔。玉瀾珠圓，真是白雪音。曾記得，屏底偶兒窺袂陽開道。馬滑霜濃月下行。到如今，欲遺表表河畔草。將愁直到短長亭。只落得，裁衣蜂蝶無聊賴。偷買胭脂抱落英。所以，目斷橋邊煙水綠。木蘭堂北踐殘春。埋怨東皇　費心。</p>

<p>開篇「太真玉殞」</p>
<p>自古紅顏薄命人。驚傳倩女已離魂。生前壓書紅塵刦。已死難尋刦後身。在當時，萬裡風雲邊塞起。祿山兵變範陽城。滿天烽火函關道。逼近長安太不甯。所以是，天子蒙塵臨蜀道。變興擁護羽林軍。孰料他，將軍衛駕陳兀禮。陽奉陰違不進行。兵士喧譁狂鼓噪。但聽得一聲殺戮動刀兵。先殘國舅諸姨妹。還說道，不斬楊妃恨不平。君王聽。變軍心。天翻地覆鬼神驚。使得那，唐家天子渾無主。栗碌心頭亂不停。欲把佳人先割愛。莫管那，長生殿上證前盟。可恨得，官軍威逼多強暴。面目猙猙如虎形。自詡堂堂天子貴。竟不能，有心營救一佳人。可憐你太真如玉如花貌。賜死投繯在白綾。一時間，玉碎香消魂已斷。傷心紫玉化煙塵。天長地久何言道。但是，死佳人不再生。終算我，陌路蕭郎辜負汝。莫說道，江山情重美人輕。可憐你，梨花樹下紅顏死。一笑曇花命不存。到今朝清酒香醪聊一奠。花殘月缺吊香魂。杜鵑啼血傷心事，燭炬成灰淚已淋。使得我，一時哭不斷腸聲。</p>

<p>— 白木</p>
<p>藝華公司有聲新片，黃喜謨編劇，方沛霖導演的「化身姑娘」，昨夜（十五日）商借上海三大公司之一永安公司攝影百貨商場一幕，除藝華職演員一百餘人全體參加外，復得永安諸同人之熱心援助，幫助演出，誠空前盛況也，　記情形如左。</p>
<p>八點鍾敲過未麼久，藝華大隊人馬已壓著十輛大卡車，浩浩蕩蕩，有如臨大敵，照相機大批用具，在富麗建樂物內逞威。</p>
<p>預備工作開始了，搬記燈光，安排開麥拉，人如潮湧，又如曦　，整個永安公司內部，只見萬頭攢動，千影擺曳。燈光打去，雪亮玻璃穿金光閃爍，如同銀色世界，煞是美觀。一任職務，未稍停留。至夜半十一時，一切均告安排妥當，於是攝影工作便積極開始進行了。</p>
<p>這一夜所拍的戲情，是袁美云剛從南洋歸來，由其祖父王桂林領帶參觀上海熱門商場，再因袁美云打扮成一翩翩佳公子，故竟有幾個摩登女郎向她逗情，是非常精采的一幕。</p>
<p>十二點鍾，是叉燒包的時間，千只叉燒包從大樂搬了下來，工作人員至此始稍作片刻的休息狼吞虎嚥，果腹作其次工作的準備。</p>
<p>叉燒包時間已過，接著攝影又在眾人的努力工作下，極其順利的進行了。</p>
<p>攝影完畢了，眾人有如凱旋戰士般吹呼如雷動，但這時節，已是東方吐白，大都會街頭將再度活躍的七點鍾。十輛大卡車雙把這一大批人馬載上了凱旋之途，迎著初春的朝風，人人的臉上都充滿著光輝，一種工作美滿的喜悅和歡慰。</p>

<p>迷途的羔羊一加緊工作，本月底可全部完成。最後之華村一景，已經搭置葳事，日內攝取，一俟華村量工作完畢後，全軍人馬即行進發蘇州，迨凱旋之時，即「迷途的羔羊」大功告成之日矣。</p>
<p>費柏青同洪　　在影片中都是向來不做好人，近乎於「浪淘沙」扮一油滑奸夫死於金　之手，拍此戲時，老金大揮鐵拳，弱不禁風之費柏青雖未被真打死，然已頭昏眼花，幾乎人事不省矣。</p>

<p>鄭君里在「迷途的羔羊」一改從前之作風，鄭當謂：「希望自己能做一個多方面的演員，迷途的羔羊所扮角色為餘一最大嘗試。」</p>
<p>「慈母曲」為聯華全體男女演員合作之最鉅片，因此片做戲演員眾多故近來攝影場上空氣更形熱鬧。</p>

<p>Postal Services Suspended in Six Counties of Northern Chahar</p>
<p>Beiping: Luo Jiaheng stated that the situation in Chahar province is stable. The previous deployment of troops to Hebei to assist in bandit suppression was not for any other reason. Currently, the 29th Army still has one division and three brigades stationed in Chahar, distributed in various locations sixty miles north of Zhangjiakou. There is absolutely no cause for concern about local security. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Luo Jiaheng, Special Diplomatic Commissioner of Chahar, is scheduled to go to Nanjing this evening to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the recent diplomatic situation in Chahar province. According to him, he went to Tianjin at the end of last month and to Zhangjiakou on the 6th of this month. At that time, rumors were rampant, but the facts were not as such. The authorities' determination not to lightly abandon land is extremely firm. Li Shouxin and Zhuo Shihuai's troops number more than two thousand in total. They are named Independent Teams and Security Teams, and there is no preparation to move south. The era name on their posted notices is reported to be Genghis Khan. The administration of the six counties has not yet been restored to its original state because negotiations have not been concluded.

He returned to Zhangbei on the 15th. Zhuo Shihuai was invited by Prince De on the morning of the 14th to leave Shangdu and go to Bangjiang for a meeting. The Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua areas are still peaceful. The new security teams recruited by the Chahar Provincial Government have not yet been fully assembled due to the scarcity of able-bodied men in various counties. The Provincial Government has extended the deadline for one month to April 1 to recruit the required number. Recently, many Japanese have been investigating mines and the economy in Zhangjiakou, Weixian, and Xuanhua. Oomoto, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency, is also assisting in the process, and the work is extremely intense. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute has released the following changes in land tax in various provinces: If the land tax in the year of the Republic is 100, then in the first year it was 59, in the first year of the Republic it was 107, in the second year 108, in the third year 108. For dry land in the plains, in the first year it was 62, in the first year of the Republic 109, in the second year 111, in the third year 111. For dry land on hillsides, in the first year it was 61, in the first year of the Republic 109, in the second year 111, in the third year 111. According to the above index, since the first year of the Republic, there has been an increase year by year, and it only came to an end in the year of the second Republic. The land tax in the third year of the Republic was equal to that in the second year of the Republic. Recently, the central government has proposed to crack down on and reorganize the surtaxes of various local governments, and the amount of tax will inevitably gradually decrease in the future. According to the observations of the institute, the percentage of land tax to land price, according to the general situation of land tax in the third year of the Republic, the tax rate of paddy fields accounts for 3.5 percent of the land price, flat land accounts for 3.26 percent, and mountain land accounts for 3.46 percent. The price of paddy fields is higher than that of flat land, and the price of flat land is higher than that of mountain land, but the proportion of land tax increases as the land price decreases. Although the collection of land tax is divided into paddy fields and hillsides, it is still unable to increase or decrease in equal proportion to the land price.

<h3 id="e31">Recent Four-Cornered Relationship in the Pacific <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In the recent situation in the Pacific, several circumstances are worth noting. First, there is talk again of a Sino-Japanese ambassador holding a Nanjing conference. Some believe that relations between the two sides are gradually improving. However, the aggressor's three principles are repeatedly emphasized and have never changed. Even the resolution of the Hebei-Chahar issue faces numerous obstacles, with even talk of intensifying the situation by increasing the number of troops stationed in North China. No one can be optimistic about such a hopeless stalemate. Second, conflicts between the Japanese puppet regime and Soviet-Mongolia have recently occurred one after another. The Soviet Union's strong stance in diplomacy and military affairs has always been a concern for the other side. However, the crisis of war in this area has clearly deepened compared to before, and we must pay close attention to it. Third, on the American side, President Roosevelt criticized so-called "bayonet diplomacy" in his New Year's Day speech this year. Later, Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, criticized so-called "international pirates." Recently, Pittman directly pointed out that the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding the Open Door Policy in China have been completely destroyed. In addition to these diplomatic expressions, the United States has also greatly increased its military expenditures. After the overturning of the Washington Naval Treaty, the antagonism between the two major imperialist powers in the Pacific is now gradually becoming overt. Fourth, although Britain has affairs in the West, the constant questioning in the House of Commons regarding the situation in North China shows a glimpse of its anxiety. The recent increase in military expenditures by the British government in Singapore, Melbourne, Fiji, and Canada is a prelude to its involvement in the Pacific situation with a stronger stance.</p>
<p>We believe that if China today wishes to talk about preparation, in addition to internal work, it should also pay close attention to the external international situation and the trend of its development and changes. There are four major powers in the Pacific: Japan, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In terms of the fundamental political and social systems, Japan, the United States, and Britain are opposed to the Soviet Union. However, there are also various conflicts of interest among these four parties individually, forming various different oppositions. At the beginning of the Manchurian Incident, the international community believed that Japan, the United States, and Britain would form a united front, with Japan as the vanguard to attack the Soviet Union. However, the subsequent development of the situation proved that this assumption was entirely based on fantasy. The continuous invasion of Chinese territory and the constant loss of sovereignty have made the contradictions between Britain and the United States and Japan increasingly prominent. Now, the dream of a united anti-Soviet front has completely vanished. Although Britain and the United States have conflicts in their fundamental systems with the Soviet Union, their anxiety about the situation in the Pacific is consistent. Although this consistency of interests has not yet created a positive united front, it has clearly produced a negative effect of mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Recently, the conflict between the Japanese puppet regime and Soviet-Mongolia has been almost a localized war. However, the reaction from Britain and the United States has been very cold. The American reaction is Pittman's strong attack on the aggressors and the Congressional passage of the Army Department's proposal to increase military expenditures by $543,341,000 to expand military facilities in the Pacific. The British reaction is the questions in Parliament regarding the protection of North China's customs duties and the interests of the Beining Railway. Both sides simultaneously expressed extreme surprise at the talk of doubling the number of Japanese troops stationed in North China. The actual conflict of interests between the United States and the Soviet Union is originally not large. Although the opposing factors between Britain and the Soviet Union are relatively strong, their recent understanding in European politics will definitely have an impact on the Far East.</p>
<p>We believe that in preparing for external resistance, if military strength is insufficient, it should be supplemented by diplomatic strength. In general, an independent and autonomous country cannot lack friends from various quarters. In the international arena, China has friends who can have fundamental understanding and friends who can be used expediently. We cannot, because of the fear of the "using barbarians to control barbarians" argument, ignore this aspect. From the recent evolution of the four-cornered relationship in the Pacific, we should have this kind of awareness.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Baldwin to Step Down? Chamberlain to Succeed as Prime Minister <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, during a meeting of the House of Commons to discuss the merger of the Army, Navy, and Air Force into a Ministry of Defense, former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain took the opportunity to severely criticize Prime Minister Baldwin. Afterwards, members of the Conservative Party were greatly disturbed. It is said that Sir Chamberlain always expresses his opinions frankly and without concealment whenever matters of national interest are at stake, and is therefore admired. As for Prime Minister Baldwin, his prestige has been diminished since the failure of the Hoare-Laval Pact proposed in December of last year to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The current organization of the national government has been able to maintain itself until now only due to various reasons in domestic politics. However, according to most members of the Conservative Party, Prime Minister Baldwin's position will be difficult to maintain until the end of this parliamentary session. Some quarters predict that Baldwin may step down this summer and be succeeded by a "resolute" Conservative, such as the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain.

<p>Chicago – Undersecretary of State Phillips recently delivered a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations here, saying, "At this time of frequent incidents and constant changes in the situation in the Far East, our actions should be carried out with a prudent, sympathetic, and patient attitude. The principles we adhere to should be based on safeguarding our national interests, fulfilling our own obligations, and ensuring the universal implementation of all international obligations. All the principles on which existing treaties are based are good for seeking peaceful resolutions to international events. If these principles can be implemented, they will greatly contribute to maintaining peace and justice in the Far East. This is what we firmly believe." He then said that the United States does not want to force any country in the Far East to accept its policies. "We do not want to launch an act of aggression against any country." From the United States' point of view, "the Open Door Policy in China is a good principle. We must not abandon it in any region of China for any country. This is in line with reason and does not violate prudence." Phillips also said that reducing tariff barriers and establishing equal rights in trade are important factors in maintaining peace. Phillips also mentioned that when the Third International met in Moscow last summer, it fully exposed the activities of the Communist Party in the United States. Secretary of State Hull protested to the Soviet government for this. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Chicago – Undersecretary of State Phillips gave a second speech here today, stating that nationalism is at its peak in Asia, but the United States will still uphold the Open Door Policy in China and reiterated what he said in his first speech, that generally speaking, the United States will try to stay out of foreign affairs that are unrelated to it. Secretary of State Hull made a statement last summer stating that if the Soviet government allows activities that interfere in the internal affairs of the United States within its borders, then the United States will find it difficult to continue formal relations with it. Phillips said that the position of the United States has not changed to this day. Phillips said, "Some countries in the Far East are struggling with various difficult problems. The United States does not want to hinder their legitimate solutions. The United States does not want to manipulate others, nor does it want to cause local disputes, and it does not want to take actions that offend any country. We only hope to proceed with a spirit of encouragement and sympathy for various evolutionary and revolutionary developments in the Far East, while vigorously protecting the principles of our own responsibilities and upholding all international responsibilities. If all countries can fulfill existing treaties regarding the Far East, then peace and justice will be close at hand." (National dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>The US Army is Insignificant Compared to the Japanese Army</p>
<p>The Army Department recently submitted a budget proposal requiring a total of $559,000,000 in funding. It has been passed by the House of Representatives and submitted to the Senate for discussion. Army Secretary Dern recently gave a speech to reporters, saying that since the late President Wilson until now, the current government has devoted itself to national defense affairs the most. He also said, "If the US Army is compared with the Japanese Army, it is already insignificant. The armaments it is equipped with are only enough to compete with countries with small territories, such as Greece. There is a need to enrich it." Someone asked whether the national defense budget was so large because we were affected by the European situation. Dern replied, "It is true that the United States is not in any danger at the moment, but the unrest in Europe is a fact, and it is very easy for the United States to be drawn into the vortex of European wars. It can be seen from past experience." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Roosevelt's Proposal</p>
<p>President Roosevelt today sent a letter to the President of Argentina and other Latin American presidents, advancing the date of the Pan-American Peace Conference to be held in the Argentine capital or other American capitals, in order to determine the best way to maintain peace in the American republics. He said that this goal can be achieved by immediately ratifying the American peace treaties that have already been negotiated, or by amending existing peace treaties, or by establishing new peace treaties through common coordination. President Roosevelt's intention is that this method can promote world peace, because any treaty that can be established is sufficient to consolidate the efforts of the League of Nations and other existing or future peace organizations. President Roosevelt also stated that the United States is very pleased with the recent agreement between Bolivia and Paraguay and that the Gran Chaco dispute can be resolved forever and justly. The concluding remarks in President Roosevelt's letter read: "The time has come for the American republics to serve the cause of pacifism on this Western continent with outstanding and practical actions." (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull gave a speech here today, stating that world peace depends on the development of the economy. Hull did not mention the government's recently announced plan to convene a meeting of American democracies to draft effective peace and neutrality policies. However, observers today are carefully studying his speech to see if there are any hints about South America. Hull said that the destruction of trade opportunities by various countries in the world is one of the greatest threats to world peace today. "If the economic conditions of various countries in the world can be properly managed domestically and can exchange trade in a mutually beneficial way to achieve prosperity, then all feelings of panic and fear will disappear in an instant. At that time, the people of the world will naturally not blindly follow leaders who advocate seeking a way out through war. If the economy cannot prosper, then it is considered that mankind has destroyed its hope and wants to seek glory in the sound of guns. Is this possible?" (National dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Capital of Uruguay – The Uruguayan government previously severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union because the Communist Party had a general office in the country, hoping to instigate riots in various countries in South America, and seized documents, learning that the party planned to instigate a revolution in the country in the spring. The country's authorities have recently discovered many important documents, and investigations have revealed that Brazilian retired General Prestes is actually the mastermind behind the scenes. He was hiding in the Soviet embassy here. All rebellious movements in various countries in South America, whether in Brazil, Chile, or Uruguay, are presided over by Prestes. This person had sent handwritten letters to various people in Uruguay, with the seal of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party on them, which has been seized by the police.

<h3 id="e40">The Tragedy of France (Part 2) <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Louis Fisher, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>Observation of the European Situation Under the Shadow of War - Part 2</p>
<p>The same indecision troubled France regarding the East African war. Because France had very little direct involvement in the events that occurred in Abyssinia, the French government only wanted to maintain a two-sided approach in the Anglo-Italian crisis. Both of them could be used to contain Germany. When Germany was weak, Franco-Italian friendship was not necessary, and the conflict between Italy and Yugoslavia (France's satellite) certainly made this difficult. In addition, Italy quite wanted to achieve something in the Balkans. But when a resurgent Germany threatened Austria and France, these problems were considered unimportant. The territorial integrity of Austria is also a permanent interest of both France and Italy, thus becoming a bridge for the union of Paris and Rome.</p>
<p>Therefore, in January 1935, Laval ran to Rome to see Mussolini. This decisive meeting was truly a turning point in recent European diplomatic history. Only the Blackshirt leader and Laval knew the whole truth, and they were unwilling to announce it. But some facts are knowable. They agreed that France would withdraw 200,000 troops from the Franco-Italian border and move them to northern France to defend against possible German intrusion. This Franco-Italian agreement also included an understanding between Italy and Yugoslavia, the guarantee of security being that the troops withdrawn by Italy from the Italo-French border would not be moved to the northeast, but would be deployed to a very, very distant place, perhaps East Africa. During the talks in Rome, Laval presented Mussolini with 2,500 shares of the French Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway and two narrow strips of land (one connecting to southern Libya and the other connecting to Eritrea). At the same time, he also declared in writing the abandonment of the rights granted to France in Abyssinia by the Anglo-Franco-Italian Agreement of December 13, 1906. At the same time, the protracted and unresolved fierce dispute between Britain and Italy over Tunisia was also resolved!! This further reassured Mussolini in Africa and the Mediterranean. In many ways, whether France wanted it or not, the invasion of Abyssinia was simply a product of France.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Franco-Italian relations, this handling by Mussolini and Laval was necessary and smart. From the beginning of the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian incident, Laval tried his best to continue the policy of Franco-Italian friendship. However, Italy was only occupying worthless land in Africa. They had already divided up the fertile land. Britain had cooperated with Italy on naval issues in order to temporarily oppose France. Now that Italy was on France's side, Britain would naturally not think of any cooperation again.</p>
<p>When Great Britain hesitated about Italy and Abyssinia, things stagnated. In May 1935, London became greatly distraught. By June, she decided to act. In preparation for the duel, she signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on June 18, 1935. The result caused a shock in Paris. Had the faithless "Albion" (the ancient name of England) returned? On February 3, Britain and France had jointly worked together in London for European peace, especially involving Germany. In the second week of April, the two powers had also agreed on the German issue. Unexpectedly, since then, as Paris said, Great Britain betrayed France and suddenly concluded a naval agreement with Germany that was detrimental to France, putting France in a disadvantageous position against Germany.</p>
<p>All these grudges could not induce France to cooperate with Britain on the Italo-Ethiopian issue. But Britain needed this cooperation and therefore insisted on it. If the British fleet were once pressed by Italian ships, it would need to take refuge in French Mediterranean ports. But would France allow them to enter? If France opposed them, the League of Nations would not seem to decide on sanctions. France hesitated. So Laval asked in return, if we are attacked by Germany, do you intend to act? Mr. Samuel Hoare frankly replied that he did not know; that it would depend on the circumstances; that it should have "Elasticity". France did not like these. Britain exerted great pressure on Paris, and Laval was forced to agree to economic sanctions. In the third week of October, just before the final resolution of the League of Nations, when the French government tried its best to oppose the embargo on Italian goods, Anglo-French relations almost broke down. Documents flew back and forth like snowflakes. France was ultimately afraid of breaking with London, and finally succumbed to Britain's orders.</p>
<p>Britain blamed France's tactics for delaying the implementation of economic sanctions, encouraging Mussolini to believe in the League of Nations' concessions and its behind-the-scenes mediation. Although French government personnel guaranteed that France would abide by its sanctions obligations, Parisian newspapers and many businessmen always hated sanctions, and perhaps secret trafficking of goods was still not prevented. France outwardly insisted on permanent negotiations to resolve the Abyssinian War. It is said that Britain's participation in these expert meetings was to prevent France from concluding articles with Rome that were unfavorable to London.</p>
<p>Britain resented France's attitude. But their resentment was much milder than that of France. France deeply felt that she had lost her independence in diplomacy. If it were necessary to explore one between Britain and Italy, France would naturally take Britain. Britain would be of more help in resisting Germany. But France harbored a fantasy of simultaneously reconciling with London and Rome, just like they shook hands with Moscow while at the same time courting Berlin. The tragedy of France lies in the refusal to choose one of the two, resulting in the loss of both. The Bolsheviks were deeply displeased by France's wooing of the "Nazis," but Franco-German rapprochement remained very slim. France's cooperation with Britain on sanctions hurt Italy, but at the same time, France's indecision still failed to generate special goodwill from Britain.</p>

<p>Italian Forces on Northern Front Initiate Offensive; Abyssinian Army Allegedly Says They Will Recapture Magala</p>
<p>Rome (Havas, 16th) - General Badoglio, the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian East African Forces, recently issued a communiqué stating that the Italian forces on the northern front initiated an offensive south of the city of Magala at dawn yesterday. Fierce fighting is reportedly underway.</p>
<p>Magala (Special Correspondent, Bal) - A dispatch from our special correspondent Bal states that the Italian High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief in Italian East Africa, Badoglio, launched an offensive in the area of Aladan. After three days of intense fighting, a great victory has reportedly been achieved. The towns of Aladan and Serico, as well as the Afgugal Plain, including the three towns of Enteiro, Bersa, and Adimesia, have been successively occupied. The Abyssinian forces involved were troops under the command of General Murolguetai, numbering approximately 80,000. Of these, 30,000 reportedly fled upon hearing the news. The Abyssinian army suffered approximately 20,000 casualties, while the Italian army suffered 400 deaths and 500 injuries. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - It is rumored that Italian forces will soon launch another offensive in the Loutigri province, particularly in the vicinity of the city of Magala. Upon hearing this news, officials here largely dismissed it, not believing it to be true. They believe it to be a feint by the Italian forces, whose real intention is to continue operations on the southern front. This is why the battles in Wogadan and Sidamo are so active. Italian forces have formally announced that the area near the city of Gelai in the White Shebeli River basin, and the area south of the city of Negri extending to Puldibib in the extreme south, are now under Italian control. The two armies are currently engaged in skirmishes. The intention behind this is to indicate that the area south of Immi, from Hualhual in the east to the cities of Jelagobigora and Haidanana in the west, is all held by the Italian forces. However, while the Italian forces have made these preparations, the Abyssinian army is also taking action to respond accordingly. According to semi-official sources here, the Italian forces in the Rondo area, at the confluence of the Ghana and Ganbai Mana rivers, encountered the Abyssinian army and suffered a major defeat, with numerous deaths. The Abyssinian army appears to be trying to prevent the Italian forces from advancing to the city of Bali, and is making every effort to organize the supply and sanitation of its troops in order to sustain a long-term effort. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Taixi - According to recent news received here, Magala has been surrounded by the Abyssinian army. Italian forces have been cut off from the outside world. The main road from Adua to Magala has been completely severed by the Abyssinian army, and roads from Magala to other places have also been rendered impassable by the Abyssinian army. It is reported that the Italian forces are now using airplanes to drop military supplies by parachute to resupply the garrison at Magala. One day, a strong wind blew several of the Italian planes' parachutes over the Abyssinian lines. The Abyssinian army did not initially know that the Italian forces were using this method to resupply the garrison at Magala. After obtaining the food attached to the parachutes, they were very suspicious and did not dare to eat it. They first fed it to dogs, and then dared to eat it themselves. The son of the Abyssinian envoy to London, Martin, was traveling in a heavy truck from Huardia to Taixi today when he was heavily bombarded by Italian artillery. He narrowly escaped injury, but shrapnel flew over his head and struck a person sitting next to him, causing one of their eyes to pop out. A member of the Tikori tribe, under General Siyum, died this afternoon when an Italian plane dropped dozens of bombs, and a bottle of wine fell on his head, causing his skull to shatter. The plane was flying at an altitude of several thousand feet, and none of the bombs dropped hit their targets. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - Many areas of Abyssinia experienced heavy rainfall yesterday. The rainfall in the Abyssinian capital was particularly heavy, the heaviest since last September, and continued for nine hours. Many of the roads leading to Taixi have now been damaged, and automobile traffic is likely to be suspended for several weeks. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital - It is reported that the Abyssinian army has occupied Kikab today, only thirty miles from the city of Aksan. Twenty Italian soldiers were killed, and the Abyssinian side also suffered forty-five casualties. (National News, 15th)</p>

<p>Moscow (National News, 15th) - Soviet officials today dismissed as "pure fabrication" a Tokyo report that a thousand Outer Mongolian troops attacked a mixed Japanese-Manchukuoan unit near Lake Belenor yesterday.</p>
<p>Moscow (TASS, 16th) - A dispatch from Kulun states that the report issued by the Tokyo No-Money Radio, claiming that a new conflict had occurred on the Manchu-Mongolian border, involving a thousand Mongolian soldiers and four armored vehicles, is absolutely untrue. Since the conflict on the Manchu-Mongolian border on February 12th (see TASS report of the 13th), no new conflicts have occurred.</p>
<p>Changchun (Domei, 16th) - According to a telegram received by the "Foreign Ministry," the truth about the Outer Mongolian troops crossing the border is as follows: Since the morning of the 15th, Outer Mongolian troops have crossed the border from the southwest of Lake Belenor, near Olho Hodoga and the southeast of Harha Temple. The area around Lake Belenor is teeming with Outer Mongolian troops and is completely occupied by them.</p>
<p>Changchun (Domei, 15th) - The fact that a thousand Outer Mongolian soldiers invaded Asli Temple has been confirmed. However, the detailed circumstances of the enemy's invasion and the extent of casualties on both sides are not yet clear. The "Manchukuo" government and the Kwantung Army authorities are currently awaiting further reports. Asli Temple, which was invaded by Mongolian troops, is located within "Manchukuo" territory, twenty-four li from the northern edge of Lake Belenor. This planned action occurred only a few days after the bombing of Olho Hodoga. The authorities have decided to respond with a policy of ensuring border security.</p>
<p>Tokyo (Domei, 16th) - Regarding the Jinchan Valley incident, Ambassador Ota met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stoermoniakov on the 14th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a telegram detailing the content of the meeting and is therefore unable to clarify the situation. However, according to reports from Moscow, one of the Soviet demands is that a third country be included in the mixed investigative committee. This claim is generally true. Foreign Ministry officials have stated their position on this matter: the participation of a third country in the Japanese-Manchukuoan-Soviet on-site mixed investigation committee is not only meaningless, but would also hinder the on-site investigation, which can be conducted more satisfactorily among the three countries directly involved. The army has not yet contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the general opinion of the army leadership is as follows: The proposal to establish a mixed Japanese-Manchukuoan-Soviet committee was made because of frequent disputes on the Manchu-Soviet border, all caused by the unclear border. Therefore, it is considered necessary to establish a clear border. The decision should be made by commissioners appointed by the countries directly involved. Therefore, there is no need to appoint a representative from a third country to participate as a commissioner. However, in order to resolve disputes amicably, it would be permissible to agree to a third country sending a commissioner as an observer to conduct an impartial investigation.</p>
<p>Washington (National News, 15th) - Military experts here today are paying more attention to the Mongolian border conflict than to the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, believing that if its scope expands, it will have a greater impact on the United States. One official stated that Japanese-led troops are testing the Mongolian resistance at various points along the Mongolian border in order to estimate the amount of military force needed to attack Siberia and the Lake Baikal region in the event of a Japanese-Russian war. He believes that Outer Mongolian troops, instigated by Soviet Russia, have extended their outposts to within the territory that Japan considers to be "Manchukuo." The most impartial opinion here is that Soviet Russia is currently focused on increasing its domestic industrial strength and is unlikely to take offensive action. At the same time, Japan is unlikely to launch a rash attack before obtaining German guarantees of military cooperation. (Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ota held talks with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stoermoniakov yesterday regarding the Russian-"Manchukuoan" border conflict. The Times has written an article commenting on the matter and discussing the Far Eastern situation, stating, "Japan's policy in Manchuria has remained unchanged since the establishment of 'Manchukuo.' Its aim is to establish a strong 'anti-communist' front throughout North China. There is no doubt about this. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, a direct war with Japan would be a dangerous experiment for the Soviet system, so it is advantageous to avoid war. As for Japan, there are many internal financial and economic difficulties, and it is busy consolidating the new position it has created in Manchuria and North China. How can it ignore everything and engage in a large-scale war on the Asian continent? From this point of view, although Japanese-Russian relations are currently strained, they are unlikely to lead to a formal war." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris (Havas, 15th) - French political circles are taking a calm approach to the Japanese-Russian border conflict, considering it not very serious. The French government is currently most concerned with German rearmament, Austrian independence, the assault on Socialist leader Léon Blum, and the upcoming general election. However, France has significant interests in the Far East and is particularly concerned about developments there due to its recent mutual assistance agreement with Soviet Russia. Although the French-Russian mutual assistance agreement is limited to Europe and does not apply to an unprovoked Japanese attack on Soviet Russia, French political circles believe that the agreement should exert a moderating influence on peace between Japan and Russia. They also believe that Japan is unlikely to attack Soviet Russia now, because since the agreement has been concluded, Soviet Russia's rear is protected by France and is not threatened by German attacks. However, the agreement is also sufficient to prevent Soviet Russia from attacking Japan, because Soviet Russia cannot obtain French assistance to jointly resist Japan. The Times published an editorial stating that the agreement is of great benefit to both countries in avoiding war. The newspaper also advocated a peaceful resolution to the border dispute. The Financial News advocated organizing an international investigation committee to demarcate the border, in order to avoid conflicts caused by an unclear border. (Reuters, 16th) Political figures here are extremely concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East. The Italian Voice believes that although a conflict between Japan and Russia is not imminent, Japan's expansionist policy on the Asian continent, which is particularly anti-communist in nature, may still lead to a conflict with Soviet Russia one day. "Perhaps Japan needs to make efforts in the political, military, and economic aspects of 'Manchukuo' and the northern part of China that it wants to control in order to achieve its full success. However, judging from past situations, although Japan usually knows how to adopt a gradual policy with the utmost caution, it sometimes cannot help but act aggressively." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow (TASS, 16th) - On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet border guards, the Central Executive Committee and the Internal Affairs Committee awarded medals to more than 300 officers of several border guard units, Red Army soldiers, border guard teams, and collective farmers in the border areas. All newspapers published commemorative articles and carried congratulatory messages from the Presidium of the Soviet Central Executive Committee and Voroshilov.</p>

<p>Five Dead, Forty Injured; President Agrees to Restore Guarantees</p>
<p>Venezuelan Capital (Reuters, 16th) - A general strike was declared here on Friday to protest the government's publication of press censorship regulations, bringing all activity in the city to a standstill for two full days. The general strike has now ended after the President acknowledged most of the demonstrators' demands, such as dismissing officials of the late dictator Gomez and abolishing the press censorship regulations. Yesterday, serious clashes occurred between police and rioters. Police opened fire in self-defense, killing ten people and injuring many others. During the strike, all public services were suspended, and newspapers and businesses were also closed.</p>
<p>Venezuelan Capital (Havas, 15th) - President Contreras suspended the constitutional guarantees of people's rights, leading to the events of Thursday. Five people were killed and forty injured in the disturbances that occurred here that day. The President then agreed to restore the guarantees in a short period of time and ordered the dismissal of the governor of the capital, Garavis, and appointed General Miberi to succeed him. In addition, several civil servants who were loyal followers of former President Gomez were also dismissed. Yesterday, a large number of rioters broke into the private residences of several important figures from the era of former President Gomez and engaged in looting.

<p>Left-Wing Parties Demonstrate Over Assault on Socialist Leader</p>
<p>Port of Dieppe, France (Havas, 16th) - Following the assault on orthodox Socialist Léon Blum by royalist thugs in Paris, disturbances have occurred between various parties from time to time. Communists here recently engaged in violent clashes with members of the royalist Action Française party, resulting in a total of three injuries. Vegetable vendors in the market also suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>Paris (Havas, 15th) - Three suspects have been arrested by police in connection with the assault on orthodox Socialist leader Léon Blum by thugs. Two are bank employees and one is a private chauffeur. A police officer at the scene of the incident identified one of them as the perpetrator. However, Blum and others in the car claimed that all three had used violence. The three men insisted that they were on the street watching the funeral of Peng Fei, the late member of the French Academy, when the incident occurred, and that others attacked Blum's car. The investigating magistrate has issued an order to detain the three men, as they are confirmed to be the perpetrators. In addition, the "Popular Front," a joint organization of left-wing parties, has scheduled a large-scale demonstration for 2:30 p.m. tomorrow, bringing together members of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party to protest the assault.</p>

<p>Madrid (Havas, 15th) - The Lower House, dissolved on January 7th of this year, is now scheduled for re-election tomorrow. According to the constitution, each province is a constituency, except for provinces with important cities, which divide the provincial capital and the rest of the province into two constituencies, such as Barcelona and Madrid. Each constituency elects one member of the Lower House for every 50,000 residents. A total of 473 members of the Lower House are elected nationwide. In order to prevent one party or a group of parties from monopolizing each constituency, the list of candidates submitted by each party must not exceed 80% of the total number of seats in that constituency. In order for the election of "majority list" candidates to be valid, one of the candidates must receive at least 40% of the total number of votes cast. The remaining seats, i.e., 20%, will be allocated to the "absolute majority" list, provided that one of the candidates receives 20% of the total number of votes cast. If no one receives 40% of the total number of votes cast in the first round of voting, a second round of voting will be held on March 1st. Only those who received at least 8% of the votes in the first round of voting will be allowed to participate in the second round.</p>
<p>Madrid (Havas, 15th) - The election of the Lower House is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Robles, the leader of the right-wing Popular Action Party, recently delivered a speech to party members, summing up the election campaign. The speech was broadcast by radio to over 400 cities and towns, stating, "Our party is confident of victory in tomorrow's election. However, party members must continue to work hard and not slacken in the slightest, ensuring that not a single vote is lost."</p>

<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>A young man enthusiastic about learning to paint came to ask me: "How can one learn to paint successfully?" Faced with this broad question, I really couldn't think of an answer for a moment. But he sat upright, his eyes fixed on my lips, as if expecting some secrets of painting to fall from them. In an instant, I turned my thoughts to the most common fault of painting learners, copying others' work, and hurriedly replied: "How can one learn to paint successfully? It's hard to say in a word. The fundamental method can be said to be to give equal importance to hand and eye. That is, one must not only practice the depiction of the wrist, but also practice the observation of the eyes." What I meant was that learning to paint must start with sketching from life, and one should not merely imitate the works of others. Because the life of a painting exists in the objects, and certainly not in painting books.</p>
<p>After studying for a while, the young man came back to ask me: "How can one learn to paint successfully?" Looking at his past achievements, I saw that they mostly focused on details while ignoring the overall picture, so the objects he painted lost their reality. So I told him again: "When sketching from life, one should not focus on details but on the overall picture, and strive to make the whole thing look like the real thing." What I meant was that his observation was not precise enough, seeing the small and forgetting the big, so his depiction was not entirely correct.</p>
<p>After studying for a while, the young man came back to ask me: "How can one learn to paint successfully?" Looking at his past achievements, although they were better than before, the shapes were still not correct. So I told him again: "The first thing to pay attention to when sketching from life is 'shape.' Whether it's details or the overall picture, if the shape is not correct, the foundation of the painting is not stable." What I meant was that his depiction of shapes was not entirely correct and he needed to pay more attention to observation.</p>
<p>After studying for a while, the young man came back to ask me: "How can one learn to paint successfully?" Looking at his past achievements, they were much better than before, but the shapes were still not completely correct, and he still couldn't fully take care of both details and the overall picture, meaning that his observing eyes were not fully trained. So, using more abstract words, I told him again: "The first thing to learn when painting is to write out the 'spirit' of the object, and not just paint the rigid form." What I meant was that I hoped he would broaden his horizons, capture the characteristics of the object, and depict the spirit of the object.</p>
<p>However, these words were too abstract, confusing the young art student and simply stopping his painting studies. I was very sorry, wishing I could share some of my physical feelings with him to complete the work that was only one basket short. One day, I met this young man again somewhere, and a child next to him was playing with a tangram. I saw him putting together the shape of a person, using only two kinds of shapes: squares, triangles, and parallelograms (malt candy-shaped). Although simple and not concerned with details, the overall picture looked very much like a person, and the spirit was vivid. Seeing this, I seemed to have an epiphany, and said to the young man on the spur of the moment: "Learning to paint should take the tangram as a model!" The young man suddenly understood under this sentence, and his subsequent achievements suddenly improved, all with artistic intent.</p>
<p>This saying is very similar to Zen Buddhism, which seems unbelievable; however, it is based on the principles of painting. Originally, the most important thing in painting is the depiction of the overall posture. The spirit of the object lies in this, and the life of the painting lies in this. With the overall picture, even if the details are ignored, it doesn't matter much. On the contrary, if the overall picture is not correct, even if the details are very precise, it is in vain. We can take daily life as an example; doctors are like looking at people. When your friend walks from a distance, even if you haven't seen the eyebrows clearly, you can tell who it is just by the overall posture. On the contrary, if you only look at one hand, or only look at a small part of the eyebrows, even if it is an acquaintance, it is not easy to recognize for a while. Also, like looking at scenery, viewing the shape of mountains from a distance, like screens, like banners, like cows, like lions, like summer clouds, like melancholy eyebrows. What you see is the spirit of the mountain. On the contrary, if you enter the mountain and look at the details, you will not see its spirit, or even not feel that you are in the mountain. Looking at willows from a distance, like smoke, like mist, like drunkards, like sleepers. What you see is the spirit of the willow. On the contrary, if you walk close to the willow and look at the details, you will not see its spirit, and it seems like another kind of tree. Watching movies should sit far away, and looking at paintings should step back a few steps, all because distant viewing can see the overall picture and see the spirit. It can be seen that the spirit of the object is not in the details but in the overall picture. If you want to capture the spirit in painting, you must pay attention to the depiction of the overall posture.</p>
<p>Among the expressions of images, nothing focuses on the overall picture more than the tangram, or the puzzle board made of thirteen pieces. The simplicity of their tools forces them to focus on the overall picture. However, if they are put together cleverly, not only are the shape and spirit very similar, but they also leave room for people to imagine, which is quite artistic. Although this is a kind of toy, it implies the key points of painting. General elementary school students use painting books, and beginners use painting manuals, which mostly start from geometric shapes such as squares and triangles; when sketching from life, the first draft must be made with straight lines, even if you draw a ball, you must first use straight lines to enclose it, all based on this painting principle. In detail, before holding a pen, learners should first make an overall observation of the object, ignoring its detailed points, but regarding it as a phenomenon composed of various geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, and rectangles. The first draft of the painting may as well be expressed with geometric shapes first, and then, based on this overall picture, add detailed descriptions one by one. In this way, no matter how detailed the description is, the overall picture will always be correct, meaning that the spirit of the object will always be preserved. The reason why the young art student succeeded was that he embarked on this great path of learning to paint.</p>
<p>Learning to paint must start with the overall picture. This does not mean that detailed description is useless, but that the overall picture is more important, and the details are less important. In detail, there are only three kinds of paintings: those that take care of both the overall picture and the details, those that take care of the overall picture and ignore the details, and those that take care of the details and ignore the overall picture. The first two are good, and the first one is a good meticulous painting. Religious paintings of the Renaissance, works of the classical school, the romantic school, and the realist school all belong to this category. The second type is a good rough painting or simple painting. Works of expressionism, fauvism, and various sketches and comics all belong to this category. Only the last third type, which takes care of the details and ignores the overall picture, is a poor product. Like some kinds of monthly calendars that are popular in our country now, flower papers sold everywhere in the lunar New Year, and most of the picture cards wrapped in cigarettes, all belong to this category. In these paintings, the depictions are probably very detailed, and the colors are red, green, and gold. They are eye-catching at first glance, and the details are very delicate when viewed closely, but when viewed from a distance, the overall picture is not right! The proportions are inappropriate, the parts are unnatural, the shapes are incorrect, so they are not like real things, and there is no spirit; even to the point of being strange and making people laugh or fear.</p>
<p>People who lack artistic education, people with low-level tastes, do not know the overall picture of painting, and the exquisiteness and brightness of the parts can satisfy their aesthetic desires. They are the admirers of the above-mentioned third type of painting. In the world, especially in our country, this kind of admirer accounts for the majority. So art is often difficult to develop properly. Therefore, artists of the past often hid in ivory towers because their music was too high and few could harmonize.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am now using the analogy of the tangram to explain the key points of painting, not only for beginners of painting. I hope that the general public also has this bit of artistic appreciation. February 3, 25th year [of the Republic of China, i.e. 1936]</p>

<p>Bandit Leaders Mostly Exploited by Foreigners The Authorities Have Taken Strict Precautions and Suppression Measures</p>
<p>Kaifeng correspondence: The bandits in Henan Province were dispersed by the army in recent years, but most of the ringleaders escaped and were not brought to justice. At this time of the turbulent situation in northern China, bandit leaders such as Cheng Daorong have been exploited again and secretly returned to Henan, cunningly plotting. The authorities have strictly issued arrest warrants and are taking precautions to prevent gatherings. However, scattered bandits in Linzhang, Neihuang, on the border with Daming, the northwest countryside of Anyang, Lin County, Wu'an, She County, Meng County, Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Yiyang in western Henan, Wan'an County in Nanyang Prefecture, and Sui County in eastern Henan have risen again to harass the people. It is said that they are all being instigated by others. However, the main bandit force of Li He and Ren Yingde, who are disrupting Tanghe, Tongbai, and Biyang, has been defeated by Zhang Zhankui of the 40th Cavalry Brigade and Yang Qutong of the New 5th Division, together with the Nanyang militia. The rest are petty thieves who harm the people, and they can be wiped out by thoroughly clearing the countryside. However, the remaining bandits of Gao Junting in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui previously had only 300 to 400 people. Recently, due to the severe drought in Guangshan, Gushi, Huangchuan, Xixian, and Shangcheng, famine victims have taken risks and increased to more than 2,000 people. In order to avoid encirclement and suppression by the National Army, the bandits have dispersed to various places, hiding during the day and coming out at night. The main force is now scattered in Huoshan, Yingshan, Luotian, Shucheng, and Macheng on the border of Anhui and Hubei. Those who flee into Henan Province include Xiong Qinghe, nicknamed Xiong Juezi, from Yinjiahe Peng, Guangshan County, with more than 100 guns, lurking in the Lingyun Temple and Laojun Mountain area on the border of Guangshan, Jing, Luo, and Huangchuan counties; Feng Changxin, nicknamed Feng Misuku, with 30 guns, is looting the Leopard Cliff and Baikan Mountain area of Shangcheng; a certain Lu, also with 30 to 40 guns, is looting the Huangbaijian area of Gushi; and a certain Fu, with 20 to 30 guns, is looting the Shudashan area, killing and robbing food. Therefore, the local area is deeply uneasy. (13th)</p>

<p>The Meeting of the Three Provinces in Tunxi Concludes Bandits in Southern Anhui to Be Eliminated Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: The meeting of the three provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi on bandit suppression in the border area, which was held in Tunxi, has now concluded. Hui Ji, the Director of the Anhui Security Department, who represented the Chairman of Anhui at the meeting in Tunxi, has recently arrived in Wuhu from Tunxi. Along the way, he inspected the self-defense strength of Huizhou and Xuancheng. After arriving in Wuhu, he summoned the Wuhu Second District Security Commander and senior officers to inquire about the local security situation. According to Hui, in addition to deciding on thorough measures to suppress the remaining bandits, the military affairs for bandit suppression in the border area of the three provinces will not be separated by boundaries in the future. All aspects of military and political affairs will take practical cooperation to achieve the effect of mutual assistance. Military actions will be completely responsible by Zhang Fakui, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Four Provinces. This unit is stationed in Jiangshan, Zhejiang, and the command is also extremely convenient. The deadline is two months to eliminate the remaining bandits. Hui also said that the defense organization in southern Anhui and other places has gradually reached the predetermined standard, so the National Army can avoid being constrained by the aftermath of bandit suppression. In addition, this business community recently received accurate news that bandits in Puli and Mingcheng Temple, located in Hefei and Shouxian in central Anhui, have been dispersed by the 7th Security Regiment, and many bandits have been captured and sent to Hefei for investigation. Although the remaining bandits are not a cause for concern, their actions are secretive and may affect public security from time to time. Therefore, Ma Jidi, the Administrative Commissioner of the Fourth District, recently went to Hefei with Staff Officer Chen Zhifu to consult with Wu Tinglin, the Commissioner of the Third District, on cooperation methods and ordered the counties under their jurisdiction to launch a joint suppression campaign to thoroughly eliminate bandits and stabilize the local area within the near future, so that the villagers will not be mistaken in the spring plowing.

<h3 id="e68">Guangdong Province Expands Civil Aviation <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Beihai Civil Aerodrome Expands Area Recent Expansion of Zhong-Fa Yue-He Route Operated by China National Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Guangdong Province has recently been expanding civil aviation. Southwest Aviation Corporation has been raising funds to open the Guangdong-Jiangxi civil aviation route. The provincial government has also been building climate measurement stations in various places in Nanlu to facilitate the flight of civil aircraft. Hepu County in Nanlu is the first county in Lianzhou and borders Guangxi Province. The area is a major route for civil aviation between Guangdong and Guangxi. The county magistrate previously suggested expanding the Beihai Aerodrome in the county. Yesterday, the provincial government decided to instruct the Suggestion Department to order Southwest Aviation Corporation to draft and reply to the aerodrome expansion plan. The methods have been drafted and submitted to the Construction Department. The department ordered the Hepu County Government to follow the instructions. The Beihai Civil Aerodrome in Hepu County originally planned to expand the area to 30,100.0 acres, 1,400 feet wide from north to south, and 2,150 feet long from east to west. Compared with the original area, the expansion is more than doubled, which is very suitable for aircraft take-off and landing, but it requires more than 80,000 yuan. Later, due to difficulties in raising funds, the Civil Aviation Corporation revised the method, temporarily not acquiring houses or relocating graves, and only expanding the north and south boundaries of the original aerodrome to 870 feet and the east and west boundaries to 1,600 feet. In this way, it can save the cost of buying land and houses, so it is now expanding according to this plan. Yesterday, the Hepu County Government was ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Southwest Aviation Corporation originally planned to operate the China-Vietnam route (i.e., from Guangdong and Guangxi to French Vietnam). Later, the Ministry of Transportation designated the China-France route to be operated by China National Aviation Corporation. The Guangxi authorities repeatedly telegraphed Nanjing to fight for it, but it was ultimately ineffective. Recently, China National Aviation Corporation has been preparing to send aircraft to fly the route, and will use new type Kesai aircraft to fly. The route is extended from the Shanghai-Guangdong route to Hanoi, French Annam, and is officially named the Guangdong-Hanoi route. It is scheduled to start operations at the end of this month. In order to connect with the Shanghai-Guangdong route, it is planned to change the schedule to fly from Shanghai to Guangdong on Mondays and Thursdays, and return north on Wednesdays and Saturdays, with two flights each way. The schedule for the Guangdong-Hanoi route is scheduled to be once a week on Fridays, arriving on the same day. The flight time and ticket price are as follows: Westbound flight, aircraft departing from Guangzhou at 6:30 a.m. on Friday, arriving at Sai Gon, French Annam at 8:30 a.m., aircraft departing from Sai Gon at 8:50 a.m., arriving at Hanoi, French Annam at 11:15 a.m. Eastbound flight, aircraft departing from Hanoi at 12:00 noon, arriving at Sai Gon at 2:25 p.m., aircraft departing from Sai Gon at 2:45 p.m., arriving at Guangzhou at 4:40 p.m. The stopover at the Sai Gon station is only 20 minutes. Ticket price, one way, each passenger from Guangzhou to Sai Gon, national currency 100 yuan, from Guangzhou to Hanoi 200 yuan, from Sai Gon to Hanoi 100 yuan. Round trip, from Guangzhou to Sai Gon, national currency 180 yuan, to Hanoi 260 yuan, from Sai Gon to Hanoi 180 yuan. Passengers traveling to Hanoi can transfer to the France-operated Europe-Asia route to fly directly to Paris. (February 12)</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>5. A Glimpse of the People's Livelihood in Hexi, Gansu</p>
<p>The Yellow River originates from the Gadasuqi Lao Mountain in Qinghai, meandering and converging across the territory of Gansu Province. What is now called Hexi is, from the perspective of Gansu, a corner of China. Hexi is located in the center of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, with an area of 398,514 square miles and a population of 1,112,284. Its terrain is strategically important, and its residents are numerous. On the one hand, it can control the border of Xinjiang and Mongolia, and on the other hand, it can shield the vicinity of Ningxia and Qinghai. It is very important in terms of national defense and economy. However, due to the obstruction of mountains and rivers and the inconvenience of transportation, the atmosphere is stagnant and the culture is backward, which is despised by the people of the inland. Because of a fleeting glimpse, I can only briefly describe the major aspects of the people's livelihood as follows:</p>
<p>"Customs" The customs and habits of a place are precisely the symbol of the people's lives in that place. This is true, isn't it? The folk customs of Hexi are not as extravagant as those in the big cities of the inland. Their customs are ancient and their folk customs are simple and honest. Most of the rural families live by farming or animal husbandry. They work tirelessly throughout the year, saving every penny they earn and not wasting it. There is no extravagance at all. Men are either engaged in farming, animal husbandry, or business, and women weave behind closed doors, all able to support themselves with a skill. However, in this simple and ancient custom, there are three very bad habits, which are indeed flaws in the white jade and a worrying problem in the Northwest: The prevalence of keeping long hair and foot binding; the ignorance and stubbornness of superstitious idols; the prevalence of opium smoking.</p>
<p>In Hexi, funerals follow ancient customs. Children wear mourning clothes for their parents for three years, and nephews and grandchildren wear them for two years; cousins wear them for three to nine months, depending on the degree of kinship. Usually, men marry at the age of eighteen and women at the age of fifteen or sixteen. However, early marriage is common everywhere. It is said that there are also "betrothals in the womb" and keeping "child brides." Marriage also follows ancient rituals, but recently, in cities and large towns, it has gradually become possible to see civilized weddings that combine Chinese and Western styles or are fully Westernized. "Products" Hexi has a vast area and abundant resources, so its products are very rich. The crops in the entire area include beans, wheat, sorghum, millet, highland barley, tobacco, as well as large-scale plants and animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, and camels. In terms of medicinal materials, rhubarb is abundant in the Qilian Mountains; wolfberries in Minqin, cistanche deserticola in Linze; licorice in Yumen and Ganta; astragalus membranaceus in Gaotai; and cynomorium songaricum, musk, and deer antler in Ganliang are all very famous.</p>
<p>As for mineral products, there are even more reserves, distributed all over the place. Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, coal, petroleum, sulfur, and salt are both complete and abundant. It is a pity that most of them have not been mined, so the treasures are hidden in the ground, only arousing the ambition of outsiders to covet them. If new methods can be used to invest in large-scale development, then the financial resources will be opened up, the economy will be abundant, and the people of the desert will live a comfortable life.</p>
<p>"Education" Culture is the driving force of social progress. If culture cannot be promoted, social life cannot move forward. The social life of Hexi has been delayed in its progress in this undeveloped culture. This is partly due to natural disasters - the prevalence of floods, droughts, and plagues, and man-made disasters - the spread of banditry and arson. The people are in a state of displacement and hardship, unable to provide for themselves with food and clothing, let alone raise funds, so education is difficult to develop. According to the investigation, there are a total of four secondary schools: one each for the Wuwei Provincial Second Normal School and the Provincial Fourth Middle School; one for the Jiuquan Provincial Fourth Normal School; and one for the Zhangye Junior High School. The total annual expenditure of the four schools is more than 30,000 yuan. The monthly salary of teachers and staff is no more than 100 yuan at the highest and only 6 yuan at the lowest. The treatment of primary school teachers is even more meager. The annual salary of an average teacher is at most less than 120 yuan, and the lowest is only 20 to 30 yuan. Can such a difficult and tight budget allow for successful and complete school education? Therefore, many adopt a perfunctory policy. The textbooks for primary schools actually still use ancient books such as the "Three Character Classic" as teaching materials. This may be due to the undeveloped local atmosphere and the conservative nature of old scholars. However, the educational situation in Hexi can already be seen.</p>
<p>6. The Current Situation of Animal Husbandry in Gansu</p>
<p>Gansu has interlaced rivers and abundant grasslands, and its natural conditions are most suitable for animal husbandry. What's more, it should also meet the needs of the environment. According to the latest survey, the following is listed for reference by those who are interested in improving animal husbandry in the Northwest.</p>
<p>(A) Types and Pastoral Areas The most numerous type of livestock is sheep, followed by cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, etc. The areas with more developed animal husbandry in Gansu Province are Haiyuan County in the east, followed by Guyuan and Huining. In the south of the province, Linze, Minxian, Xiahe, and Xigu counties produce a particularly large number of livestock. The yak, hairy cattle, and Fanheiyang sheep produced there are very famous. In Yongdeng, Minqin, Shandan, Yongchang and other counties in the west of the province, animal husbandry is also flourishing. In Liancheng Songshan, which belongs to Yongdeng County, it is common to see Fan people raising thousands of cattle and horses, plus one or two thousand sheep. In addition to herding sheep, the people of Minqin County also raise thousands of camels. In the past, the so-called "Zhenfan Ma family" raised more than 20,000 camels in one household. The prosperity of animal husbandry can be seen. Jingyuan and Jingtai counties in the west of the province are said to produce abundant sheep, and the lambskin produced in Dalu and Xiaolutang is said to be no less than that of Ningxia.</p>
<p>(B) Pastures Animal husbandry in Gansu is mostly carried out by individual households, breeding and living on the land. There are very few organizations such as animal husbandry companies or joint animal husbandry farms. In the past, there were horse farms in Ganzhou (Zhangye), Liangzhou (Wuwei), Suzhou (Jiuquan), and Xining (now belonging to Qinghai), which were managed by the government. The number of horses raised in the horse farms reached more than 30,000. However, they have all been destroyed by years of war. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, a farm was set up in Dama Camp, which was under the jurisdiction of Gulang County, to graze and raise more than 1,000 horses. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, it was changed to a stud farm, and then three branch farms were set up in Haiyuan Pingfan (under the jurisdiction of Yongdeng County) and Maxianshan (under the jurisdiction of Gaolan County), all of which were under the jurisdiction of the Military Department of the Provincial Government. Before long, they were successively closed and disappeared. The more famous private pastures are Liancheng Songshan Beach (under the jurisdiction of Yongdeng County), Beihai (under the jurisdiction of Minqin County), and Huangyan Lake (under the jurisdiction of Wuwei County), which have a wide range. As for Dalu and Xiaolutang, Wufosi, and various places in Xiahe County, there is livestock everywhere and grazing everywhere.</p>
<p>(C) Feeding The feeding methods of livestock mostly rely on nature in the folk. In places where water and grass are abundant, they are grazed at will. Large groups are mostly chosen to be placed in suitable locations on the grasslands, foothills, or river beaches, and then simple stables are built to provide a place to rest at night. Large livestock such as mules and horses must be fed bran and hay once every night when they return to the stable. Cattle and sheep are only fed hay on snowy days in winter. The hay is mostly cut from the mountains in early autumn and transported to houses to be stored for feeding on snowy nights. The amount of artificial feeding is also described below. Mule and horse feed - half beans and oats, and 2 catties of bran each, and 3 catties of grass. Excellent horses are fed bran every day, and ordinary horses are either fed feed or bran, not both. Cattle are fed 3 catties of hay in winter snow, and are not fed bran and are forbidden to use it, for fear of damaging the spleen. After giving birth, they are kept in the circle for seven days and fed broad bean noodle soup to make it easier to produce milk. Sheep are fed one and a half catties of grass on snowy nights. After giving birth, they are kept in the circle for three days and fed grass and noodle soup to make milk. Camels need to eat 3 catties of small beans and half a catty of green salt every day. The above quantities are based on the investigation in Gaolan County. Other counties may have minor differences but are generally the same.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Lecture on History Foreign History (2) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Professor Shen Gangbo of Central University</p>
<p>What I just said is the common point of all history. But foreign history is really more useful for modern Chinese youth. Because it can make up for the shortcomings of national history. The virtues of our nation are filial piety, brotherhood, benevolence, righteousness, diligence, thrift, and peace; what is lacking is the spirit of being public and forgetting self, forgetting family for the country, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, and fighting to the end. In the national history, there are certainly many models of doing one's best and sacrificing oneself to save others, but at the same time, it is also full of the theories and deeds of the Huang-Lao school. As a result, the spirit of self-improvement, becoming benevolent, and taking righteousness is often neutralized and offset by the theory of protecting oneself wisely and being pure and inactive, making it equal to zero. As for foreign history, there are only examples of the former and very few discussions of the latter. Isn't it the most sufficient to save the evils of Chinese traditional thought? There is another layer. Chinese history books are mostly official histories. Those who are ordered to write history are certainly knowledgeable, but they are always inevitably constrained by political power and cannot escape the scope of orthodox thought. Therefore, they are not very free in selecting materials and recording facts. The conclusions they reach are naturally difficult to fully agree with the truth. Therefore, Mencius said long ago: "It is better to have no books than to believe them all." This is the difficulty of learning Chinese history. Young students have little experience in the world and limited opinions. If no one guides them, it is difficult to obtain the truth from it. As for foreign history, they are all private works. They have great freedom and are not much constrained by external forces. In addition, their sociology and archeology are very advanced. The history written using scientific methods and with the help of science is naturally more precise and in line with the truth. Therefore, if young students want to cultivate the freedom of thought, practice the precision of observation, and train the correctness of judgment, it is most beneficial to read more foreign history books.</p>
<p>From this point of view, foreign history can not only give us a scientific spirit, but also mold our great personality. Its use is so great, can we still say that it has nothing to do with me and that learning it is a waste of time?</p>
<p>The second objection to teaching foreign history in middle schools is due to a misunderstanding of the content of foreign history in middle schools. Middle school students learning foreign history do not need to be completely, "exhaustively learned and widely heard." All the excitement of wars, the trivial matters of the court, the sacred traces of religions, the art of gold and stone, the anecdotes of celebrities, the allusions of the literary world, and the research of those bronze swords, stone axes, broken bowls, and broken bricks are all matters for history experts, and middle school students do not need to worry about them. What middle school students should know is only the general outline of the changes in foreign political and legal systems, the overview of the evolution of economic organizations, and the direction of the development of academic thought. Knowing these, they can have a correct understanding of the trend of the world and can also understand the modern international situation and the relations between various countries and us. Therefore, the content of foreign history in middle schools is not in breadth but in essence, not in quantity but in quality. So, what standard should be used to select materials? The Italian historian Croce said: "The characteristic of history is the modernization of its thought. All records that are irrelevant to the present are not considered history." This statement is quite problematic in the eyes of history experts. But if it is used as a standard for middle school students to choose historical materials, it is very correct. Therefore, I advise everyone to read foreign history according to Croce's proposal. When encountering something, first ask whether it is directly or indirectly related to today's world. If there is a relationship, then even if the matter is small, it should be noted. If it is irrelevant, then even if it is interesting in itself, you don't have to care about it. For example, the first people to arrive in the Americas may have been the Vikings of Northern Europe or even earlier Chinese people. Experts can devote their entire lives to studying this problem. As for middle school students, they can ignore it. Because in any case, the development of the Americas began after Columbus went there. The Vikings who had been to California before and the Chinese who had been to Canada really had no influence on the New World and no contribution to the Old World. Studying them is not enough to help us understand today's America, so why should we care about it? To give another example, in Greek history, they all talk about the Peloponnesian War, and in Roman history, they all talk about the Punic War. These two events were indeed extremely important to ancient Greece and Rome; if they are regarded as moral lessons, they are also quite valuable. But let me ask, how has the collapse of the Athenian Empire hindered the development of modern civilian politics; how has the temporary dominance of Sparta had anything to do with the prevalence of militarism today; and how has Hannibal's world-famous reputation affected Europe and Africa today? So, why should middle school students bother to remember them? There are quite a few similar records in a small foreign history textbook. The wars and temporary systems of many dynasties are not necessarily related to the present. If we can all use the three words "modernity" as the standard for studying Western history, we can simplify the complex and save trouble.</p>
<p>The third group of people advocates exploring the glorious history of our country to promote national spirit, which is correct. But to say that learning foreign history can easily be confused by heresies and shake one's own good traditional ideas is to know only one thing and not the other. The history of mankind is originally a whole, and the cultures of the world are all related to each other. If you don't ask about the whole history, but only learn the partial history, that is like blind men touching an elephant, and you will never really recognize the elephant! For example, the most powerful era of the Han people was none other than the Han and Tang Dynasties. Let me ask, can you fully understand the political facilities of the Han and Tang Dynasties without understanding the foreign situation at that time? What is most related to today is the Qing Dynasty. Let me ask, can you successfully study the history of the past hundred years without knowing foreign history? As for the history of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, it is intricately related to foreign history everywhere, which is even more unnecessary to say. Not only politics, but also academics. Our country's calendar, mathematics, medicine, art, music, religious beliefs, clothing, decoration, and even the study of rhymes and initials, and the theory of understanding the mind and seeing the nature, have all been influenced by foreign cultures. If we want to trace the roots and understand the national conditions, we really have to refer to foreign history. For example, if a person wants to understand the words and deeds of his grandfather and father, it is not enough to only know his grandfather and father. You also have to know the friends and relatives who often interact with his grandfather and father. Even the servants they used and the enemies they fought with must be known. Therefore, it is said that to promote national quintessence, we must never adopt an attitude of deep closure and isolation.</p>
<p>Moreover, today is not an era of pioneering. If we don't understand the true appearance of foreign countries, we will have no way to deal with foreign countries. The foreign countries of today have all evolved from their past history. If we don't know their history, we will never understand their current situation, and we will have no way to judge their gains and losses, predict their future, and formulate a response policy. To give an example, the world today is actually dominated by three doctrines: liberalism, communism, and fascism. Why can only Britain and France maintain freedom? Why can Russia implement communism? Why is fascism prevalent in Italy and Germany? I would say that you can't find the reason for it without looking at the history of the past two hundred years. If you don't know their special historical background, how can you criticize its good or bad, predict its success or failure, and decide our attitude towards it? The failure of the Reform Movement in the late Qing Dynasty, the failure of the trial of parliamentary politics in the early Republic of China, the damage to China's vitality by the recent communist movement, and the fact that various imported doctrines do not fully conform to the national conditions and only disturb the people are all because they only know the fur of foreign countries and do not understand its historical background. If we can thoroughly understand the causes and consequences of various doctrines, we will naturally know how to determine the national conditions, judge the urgency, and use the most economical and appropriate methods to learn from others' strengths, make up for our own weaknesses, and innovate and build with half the effort. How can we blindly follow others and repeatedly go the wrong way, cutting our feet to fit the shoes, and failing to draw a tiger well? People often say "know yourself and your enemy." If we really want to "know them," we need to learn their history; to thoroughly "know ourselves," we also need to refer to and compare their history. In short, if you don't have the knowledge of world history, it is impossible to be a useful citizen today.</p>
<p>But learning foreign history is not enough to know many fragmented historical materials. Any knowledge must be thorough; a half-baked understanding is very dangerous. A few years ago, a diplomat went to the United States and talked to reporters, saying: "The three northeastern provinces have become the Alsace-Lorraines of the East." He only knew that France and Germany had become sworn enemies due to the dispute over Alsace-Lorraine, which affected the whole of Europe; he did not know that the historical relationship between the Germans and Alsace-Lorraine was completely different from the historical relationship between the Japanese and the three northeastern provinces. Quoting allusions wrongly not only loses the national image unconsciously, but is also tantamount to speaking for the Japanese. From this point of view, if you don't really learn foreign history thoroughly, you will be clever and far-fetched, not only making a fool of yourself, but also causing great trouble.</p>
<p>If you want to learn thoroughly, you have to study the method of learning thoroughly. After all the middle school students go to college in the future, whether they study science and engineering, or medicine and agriculture, they may never have the opportunity to formally study foreign history again. This bit of foreign history knowledge all depends on what you learn in middle school. If you want to learn thousands of years of world history thoroughly in a short period of a few years, you must have a method of controlling complexity with simplicity. Memorizing the book to death is of no use.</p>
<p>If you want to get the method of studying history, you must first determine the attitude of reading history. The same book, "the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." If the views are different, the methods will naturally be different. Therefore, if you want to know a good historical method, you must first develop a normal historical concept. Those who have studied history in the past have talked about "subtle words and great meanings" and "praising and criticizing penmanship," which is to find ethical lessons in history with a philosophical attitude. Some specialize in discussing natural disasters and man-made disasters, good and evil, cause and effect, which is a religious concept to seek theological arguments in history. Some carefully examine words and sentences, appreciate historical writing, and say that Thucydides' records are concise and meaningful, and Gibbon's narratives are vivid. This is to find the beauty of art in history with a literary eye. There are also people who advocate the superhuman view of history, regarding a history as the deeds of a few heroes. Some people boast about the "national historical view," regarding all human culture as the creation of their own race. Some people expound the "materialist historical view," regarding people as ants and bees, as if everything in the past and present is nothing but a struggle for food and clothing - these are all using a politician's attitude to find their propaganda materials in history. These people have their own prejudices, and therefore have their own methods, but none of them are the proper attitude to study history, especially not the historical concept that middle school students should have. Because history is not philosophy, not literature, and even less a political tool; it is really the process of the evolution of the entire human race. Therefore, we should use the concept of evolution and the scientific attitude to seek the laws of human evolution in it. Students who study "natural history" study small animals and plants in the same way; they should use magnifying glasses to see its entirety clearly, and then use microscopes to carefully examine its organization; they must never wear colored glasses and see everything in a different color!

<h3 id="e71">General Situation of Sichuan Provincial Government's Implementation of New Policies in the First Year of Establishment <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>——Report by Deng Mingjie at the Anniversary Commemoration——</p>
<p>Chengdu Air Dispatch: The Sichuan Provincial Government was established in Chongqing on February 10th of last year. The 10th of this month marks its first anniversary. At 9:00 AM that day, officials from various departments and offices of the Provincial Government gathered in the Provincial Government's main office building to hold a celebration ceremony. More than 800 people attended, including Secretary-General Deng Mingjie, Director Fei Dongming, Commissioner Xie Peiyun, secretaries and section chiefs of various departments and offices, heads of various sections, and staff at all levels. After performing the ceremonial rites, Secretary-General Deng delivered a detailed and pertinent report on the work of the Provincial Government in the past year and the future direction of its efforts. The full text of his speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow colleagues, today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Provincial Government. The significance of our celebration here lies in reviewing the past and encouraging the future. Taking this opportunity, I would like to briefly report to you on the progress of the past year. Since its establishment last year, Chairman Liu believes that the Provincial Government bears three major missions: unifying the entire Sichuan, alleviating the suffering of the people, and building a new Sichuan. These will be briefly described separately below.</p>
<p>Unifying Sichuan First, unifying Sichuan. Because in the past, there was the division of defense zones, which invisibly divided the entire Sichuan into several small provinces. Although there was a legitimate provincial government in name, in fact, none of the government orders were thoroughly implemented. At the beginning of the new Provincial Government's establishment, the Chairman and all the commissioners believed that if the defense zones were not broken, the Provincial Government would still become an organization with only a name but no substance in the future. Therefore, while reporting their assumption of office, they telegraphed the leaders of various armies, stating the significance of recovering political power and completing unification. Fortunately, the leaders of various armies were able to take the overall situation into consideration, and in a very short period of time, they all agreed to return political power to the Provincial Government. In order to make government orders easier to implement, the Provincial Government simultaneously transferred all county magistrates in Sichuan, so that the county magistrate of area A was transferred to area B, and the county magistrate of area B was transferred to area C. In this way, the past malpractices of separation and isolation have been almost completely eliminated. Therefore, this first point of unifying Sichuan has already been fully achieved.</p>
<p>Reducing the People's Burden Second, reducing the people's burden. In the past, with the formation of the defense zone system, the collection of taxes in each military region was not only unlimited, but also lacked standards. In severe cases, taxes were collected ten times a year, and at least six or seven times in others. After the establishment of the new Provincial Government, it felt that the people's burden was too heavy and urgently wanted to find ways to reduce it to alleviate the people's difficulties. However, the situation at that time was special. There were hundreds of thousands of troops in Sichuan, and military expenses were huge, and the cost of suppressing bandits was particularly urgent, so it was still set at four levies a year. But looking back at the 24th year of the Republic, the actual burden on the people was more than that. First, because the recovery of the defense zones started from March 1, there were many pre-collected funds from the previous armies. Second, the construction of blockhouses, roads, etc., was stipulated by the headquarters as not requiring additional grain taxes. However, the situation in each county was different. In order to equalize the burden, there was no alternative but to add a little to the grain tax to meet the urgent needs. Because of these two reasons, when it comes to reducing the people's burden, we have not achieved it. Only in the possible scope, we have done things for the benefit of the people, such as implementing a single tax system, reducing tax rates, and abolishing checkpoints in various places to reduce the trouble for people traveling, which is still somewhat satisfactory.</p>
<p>Construction Projects Third, building a new Sichuan. The previous situation in Sichuan was extremely chaotic, and its vitality was greatly damaged. When it comes to building a new Sichuan, it is a very difficult thing, especially not something that can be done in a short time. Rather than chanting high-sounding slogans about some multi-year plan, it is better to practically achieve a few results. Therefore, within the political program implemented in the 24th year of the Republic, the construction items are all those that we can actually do. When drafting the program, the headquarters had not yet stipulated the amount of funding. Later, due to the expansion of military expenses, income and expenditure were not easy to match. The total administrative expenses of the province were stipulated to be 12 million yuan for the whole year. Various undertakings were limited by funding and could not be fully developed. In addition, the extension of the military affairs of suppressing bandits later led to various new undertakings failing to reach our expected level.</p>
<p>Work of Various Departments The work of various departments and offices in the past year has also achieved a lot. In terms of civil affairs, such as dividing the province into eighteen administrative inspector districts, and the county government's abolition of bureaus and reorganization into sections, the establishment of district offices, etc., have all been realized one after another. In addition, in order to cultivate grassroots talents for county administration, a training institute for county administrative personnel was specially established. There have been two sessions, and the number of graduates has exceeded 600. Land administration is also being prepared. Most of the other undertakings are also being planned and implemented, and will be implemented one by one in the near future. In terms of finance, such as the division of national and local taxes, the reorganization of old debts, the elimination of the long-standing malpractices of land taxes, the recovery of land notes, the establishment of the Three Provinces Bank, and the abolition of excessive taxes, judging from the implementation of the political program, it can be regarded as achieving sixty to seventy percent. In terms of education, such as the determination of the province's education funding as 1.8 million yuan per year, the rectification of higher education, the abolition of overlapping departments, the strengthening of military training and children's training, the verification of school teachers, and the promotion of free education, all these are efforts to restore the atmosphere and cultivate real talents. In terms of construction, such as the major repair of Dujiangyan, the opening of the Sichuan-Guizhou and Sichuan-Shaanxi highways, and the construction of the Sichuan-Hunan and Sichuan-Hubei roads, all are constructed from the perspective of production. Recently, the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Railways have been working together to plan the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Today's Sichuan, when it comes to construction, not only focuses on development, but also needs to take national defense into consideration.</p>
<p>In terms of Security In terms of security, after the establishment of the Security Department, the first priority was to eliminate long-standing malpractices, reorganize the province's local militias into 412 security companies, and there were also proper regulations on funding, which must not be added arbitrarily. In addition, the establishment of a training class for security team cadres in the province, and the holding of training classes for county magistrates and training classes for strong men team cadres in various districts, are all actively underway.</p>
<p>Changing the Atmosphere Finally, there is still something to say to all colleagues. The common problem of Chinese people is that they are unwilling to do things themselves, but they are jealous of others doing things. This is a very bad phenomenon. I think many things are not afraid of being monopolized, but afraid of not being done. In the future, when we want to comment on something or criticize someone, we must obtain definite facts before drawing conclusions. Rumors and speculations are already bad when they come from ordinary people, and even more so when they come from civil servants. Chairman Liu always expects his colleagues to change the atmosphere, and hopes that his colleagues will pay more attention, so as not to lose their status as civil servants and can set an example for others.</p>
<p>The situation of the Sichuan Provincial Government's implementation of new policies in the past year as described in Deng's speech is all factual. In just one year, such achievements have been made, and the progress is not insignificant. This is indeed due to the supervision of the central authorities, and the efforts and progress of the Sichuan authorities are also commendable. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Regulations of Jin Province: Measures for Reviving Agriculture and Commerce <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Establishing a Rural Relief Bureau to Train Merchants Inside and Outside the Province</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The stagnation of finance and the bankruptcy of the rural economy in Jin Province have always been a concern of the authorities. In addition to the joint establishment of a fully-prepared real goods reserve by the four provincial banks and firms to purchase agricultural products to ease the situation, a provincial rural relief bureau has recently been established. Wang Xiang, concurrently the commissioner of the Provincial Committee and the Department of Construction, recently resigned from his position as commissioner to devote himself to the affairs of the Rural Relief Bureau. The authorities have also convened a provincial cotton industry conference in recent days to stipulate promotion methods and compel people to plant cotton. It is reported that Yan Xishan intends to simultaneously advance the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. On the morning of the 12th, Yan specially convened related personnel from the financial and industrial sectors at the Suiyuan Headquarters to discuss the progress. The following are the resolutions recorded:</p>
<p>Agent Merchants Convenience Measures In order to universally relieve the rural areas of this province, the government previously sent personnel to various remote counties to purchase agricultural products, so that the economic activities of the province tend to balance and development. Now, in order to facilitate merchants, each merchant is allowed to apply for agency. As for the agency affairs of merchants, in addition to handling in accordance with the agency regulations, the director of the Economic Control Office, Zhang Zhijie, is specially designated to convene the grain merchants in this city, and the assistant manager of the Reserve, Hao Qingzhao, is designated to convene the silver and money industry in this city to study the convenience measures for agency according to the actual local situation. It is decided that each agent merchant will be gradually established in the short term. As for the agent merchants in other counties, many have been approved.</p>
<p>Promote Production Comprehensive Management The Rural Relief Bureau established in this province is managed in a comprehensive manner in the latest way. The primary task is to revive the rural economy and provide as much support and promotion as possible for agricultural and industrial products in various counties. In the future, the Rural Relief Bureau, the Real Goods Reserve, and the Produce Trading Company will cooperate. In addition to the director, Wang Xiang, also serving as the manager of the Reserve, the internal personnel of the Bureau will be concurrently managed by the personnel of the Real Goods Reserve. The organizational methods and work progress plan will be formulated in detail after Wang takes office.</p>
<p>Xue and Kong Assigned to Shaanxi and Gansu Regarding the revival of the province's overseas commerce, it was discussed in detail last week, and the issue was continued to be discussed on the morning of the 12th. It is planned to convene unemployed merchants as soon as possible for centralized training. In the northwest provinces such as Qinghai, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, etc., merchants from this province still account for the majority. Xue Xiuqing (father of Xue Dubi) and Kong Fan, etc., who have excellent knowledge and rich experience, are specially requested to go to these provinces to guide and impart new knowledge. The training methods have now been formulated and will be implemented after detailed review.</p>
<p>Ten Counties Dispatch Personnel to Reorganize Public Property To reorganize the province's overseas public property such as guild halls and land, the Chamber of Commerce is urged to convene merchants from various counties in the province who are familiar with the outside world to come to the province to discuss methods. It is now stipulated that each of the ten counties in the Central Route will send one representative to the province to form a reorganization committee, and Xue Xiuqing and Kong Fan are requested to convene the local merchants to handle the matter when they go to the various counties to guide the merchants. The income after the reorganization will be entirely used to revive the province's overseas commerce.</p>
<p>Regulating People's Food Milling Flour by Oneself In order to regulate people's food and balance grain prices, it was previously decided that the Reserve would mill flour by itself. A proper method has been agreed upon with Jin Feng Electric Light and two manufacturers. Jin Feng Company signed a contract on the 9th, and the Electric Light Company also signed on the 12th. For the flour milling method, Jin Feng Company has a total of five machines, which can grind 1,500 shi of wheat per day and produce more than 4,000 bags of flour. The machines that were previously stopped will be opened for grinding in the future, and the Northwest Electric Plant will supply electricity. It is also stipulated that in order to maintain the operation of the plant, the first half of each month will be for the Reserve to grind flour, and the second half of the month will be for the stone mill to grind flour. The Reserve has recently hired many flour milling technicians from Shanghai, who can start grinding within days. As for the Electric Light Company, it can grind 600 shi of wheat per day and produce 1,500 bags of flour, which is stipulated for the whole month. After the flour is produced, it will be sold at the most balanced price. Yan Xishan also personally instructed the personnel of the Reserve that in order to maintain the people's food, there should be no profit-making behavior. (February 12)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Jiangxi Province Stipulates This Year as the Year of Water Conservancy Construction <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Province is Divided into Eight Major Regions, with Both Flood and Drought Prevention Advancing</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Jiangxi Provincial Government now takes the revitalization of rural areas as the center of politics, and the revitalization of rural areas takes water conservancy construction as the only basic work. Therefore, the Provincial Government has specifically designated this year as the Year of Water Conservancy Construction. The construction plan has long divided the province into eight major regions, and the regional affairs are presided over by the Water Conservancy Bureau in conjunction with the administrative commissioners and county magistrates. All the rivers of the Gan River, Fu River, Rao River, Xin River, Xiu River, Yuan River, and Rui River, the middle and lower reaches will engage in embankment reinforcement, river dredging, and gate construction, and the upper reaches will engage in tree planting, canal opening, and well digging, one for flood prevention and the other for drought prevention, so as to advance on both sides. In addition to the severely affected areas such as northern Jiangxi using work as relief, the above projects are all conscripted labor. On average, all county Baojia strong men must serve for five to fifteen days. The first and second phases of conscripted labor in Fengcheng, Linchuan, and other counties have been implemented in order, and the main embankments of the rivers have been renewed. In terms of tree planting, all barren mountains, wasteland, and both sides of the roads are planted with trees. The seedlings are supplied by the Agricultural Institute, various water conservancy districts, various administrative regions, and even the nurseries of various counties and districts. The public officials in this city will perform labor service and plant trees on a regular basis in Qingyunpu. (February 10)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Anhui Finance Department Rectifies Land Deed and Other Taxes <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>More Commissioners Appointed as Heads of Land Deed Tax Bureaus</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: In order to adjust the tax revenue of the province, the Anhui Finance Department is now determined to thoroughly improve local taxes and deed taxes. Regarding local taxes, the counties that have reported tax amounts, except for those that have exceeded the ratio or have sufficient ratio, are allowed to collect as before. Those with a large shortfall will be supervised and urged to re-examine them uniformly. All stores that have underreported, omitted, or reopened in the previous year will be verified on the spot and the ratio will be increased. Regarding deed taxes, during the period when the county government handled the matter, the annual income only reached two or thirty percent according to the ratio. Since the establishment of the office for reorganization in the 23rd year of the Republic, although the ratio has not yet been fully collected, it has actually exceeded the annual budget by more than one time. If the reorganization can be continued extensively, the annual million ratio will not be difficult to collect. This is also one of the major income sources of the provincial treasury. In addition to complying with Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the outline of the county government's abolition of bureaus and reorganization of sections promulgated by the chairman's headquarters, the Finance Department has specially reported that special bureaus will still be set up to collect taxes, and will also work with the Deed Tax Reorganization Office to replace those who have not handled the affairs of the county bureaus well in order to reorganize them. The newly appointed ones include Huang Zizhong, head of the Huaining Local Tax Bureau, Liu Xi of Lingbi, Tan Bing of Guoyang, Yu Qijun, head of the Huaining Deed Tax Bureau, Tang Ying of Tongcheng, Liu Ou of Chuxian, Huang Shengwu of Tianchang, Wang Jingwen of Lai'an, Wu Yulin of Xuyi, Guang Yingyuan of Linquan, and Sun Jingfang of Jiashan. Now many of them have taken up new positions and are implementing reorganization in accordance with the plans of the Finance Department. (February 15)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Registration Period for Smokers to Reform Themselves in Jiangsu Province Expires <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>—Total Investigation Starts on the 16th—</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The general registration of smokers in Jiangsu Province to reform themselves was uniformly announced to be closed on the 15th. The total number of registered smokers reached 70,000 by the 10th of this month. Statistics show that it will not be less than 80,000 by the 15th. From the 16th, the general investigation of drug offenders will begin. If private smokers are found thereafter, they will be punished with extremely severe crimes. The Department of Civil Affairs yesterday issued a strict order to the counties, saying, "This province has resolutely banned smoking for a long time. Since the implementation of the phased rehabilitation method, fearing that smokers are accustomed to long-standing habits and still have a fluke mentality, a mandatory registration has been implemented. Considering that smokers traveling abroad may not fully understand the smoking ban laws and regulations of this province, they are given a supplementary registration. Those who are stubborn and unrepentant will eventually be brought to justice. Before the implementation of the smoking ban and punishment regulations in this province, the principle of no punishment before the sentence and not punishing those who have not been educated is still followed. A self-surrender regulation for smokers has been formulated. All smokers who surrender to the local smoking ban authorities will be leniently exempted from punishment and given rehabilitation. The government is considerate and compassionate to these people who have fallen into the black book, and it is not to the point. They are expected to repent and return on their own, and it is not inappropriate to expect them to turn around. Although there have been tens of millions of people who have quit or are being rehabilitated and forcibly rehabilitated for a year, and in remote areas, ignorant people may not have heard of it or may have a contemptuous attitude, and there are still many places. Law enforcement is certainly unforgivable, and the original situation is still commendable. Therefore, a general investigation method for drug offenders has been stipulated, and the Baojia organization of this province has been used to hold the Baojia chiefs of the district and township responsible for the general investigation in order to thoroughly eliminate it. One month before the implementation of the general investigation, smokers who are indeed repentant may apply for self-renewal registration after proof to avoid punishment, receive a certificate for rehabilitation, and give them the last way to reform themselves. It should be known that the government's compassion and consideration for smokers is not hesitate to be repeated again and again, just to enable all the addicted and helpless smokers in the province to get rid of drug abuse, not to be hesitant and hesitant to those who are foolish and fearless of the law. Now that the period for self-renewal registration has expired, the government has done everything possible to give smokers who have not yet registered and received rehabilitation the opportunity to repent and renew themselves. From now on, only strict investigation and law enforcement will follow. It is hoped that the people who are suffering from drug addiction will be punished for the tragedy of destroying the country and destroying the species, and internally fear the worry of breaking up the family and losing their lives. They will uphold the government's original intention of implementing the policy and strive for their own self-reliance and self-improvement. They will quickly make a decision and quickly pull themselves together so that the number of smokers in the prison population will decrease day by day, and the drug offenders who are executed will not be recorded in the system. This is the government's original intention to eliminate drug abuse, and it is also the basis for the country and nation to strengthen and stand on its own. Each should think carefully and not make mistakes again. I hope that the county magistrate will give a kind announcement and make it known to all."</p>

<p>The Deyuan Road Starts Construction</p>
<p>This county is holding labor service for public officials, teachers, and students, with the construction of Deyuan Road as the central task. Under the leadership of County Magistrate Long Tiyao and Construction Bureau Chief Zhang Fulin, 1,350 participants held a groundbreaking ceremony. In the early stage, the Construction Bureau sent personnel to divide the road into small sections, draw gray lines, and nail center stakes. Each section was marked with a flag to indicate it, and the road surface was stipulated to be 9 meters, the soil slope was 1:1.5, that is, 1 meter high and 1.5 meters horizontal, the soil ditch was 2 meters away from the roadside, and each person worked on 1 cubic meter of earthwork per day. Yesterday (16th) morning at 8:00 AM, 143 soldiers from the 6th Battalion of the Security Corps, led by Deputy Captain Shen, went to work on the road and were quite serious. They rested at 12:00 noon and continued to work at 2:00 PM until 5:00 PM. On the school side, it is scheduled to start construction on the 23rd of this month. The Construction Bureau sent technicians Xu Chuzhen and Wang Fengxiang to guide them. In addition, the street brick road and houses in Zhenyingdao Lane, from Chong'an Temple to Ximen Bridge, have been completely demolished. Hongmaosheng Meat Shop in Xiqiaopu has also been taken in. The remaining households that have not been demolished are limited to demolition by the end of February. Once everything is in place, road construction can begin. In the future, the road can be connected to Deyuan Road and reach Kaiyuan Road. In addition, the reconstruction of the Tingzi Bridge in the East Gate into a cement bridge can also begin in the near future.</p>
<p>The Adjudication Officer's Case of Malfeasance is Released on Bail</p>
<p>The former adjudication officers of the Jiangyin County Government, Zhou Xiang and Shi Wending, were suspected of accepting bribes and malfeasance. The Higher Court designated the local court of this county to hear the case and detained Zhou and Shi. After Zhou and Shi were imprisoned, they were sent to the Pure Benevolence Sanatorium and two hospitals for treatment because they were seriously ill. The forensic doctors were sent to guard them in turns. The inside story of the case has been slightly revealed after several interrogations by the court. The prosecutor Shen recently signed and submitted the detained related persons Chen Yipeng and Yuan Quanmei to the court and sent them back to the Jiangyin County Government for trial. Zhou and Shi were also brought to the court and released on bail separately. It was ordered that Zhou Xiang pay 2,000 yuan in cash and 2,000 yuan in written guarantee. At that time, 2,000 yuan in cash had been sent to the court, but it was difficult to find a store for the 2,000 yuan written guarantee. Only three ordinary stores were found, but they could not be released on bail and were still sent to the hospital for treatment. Shi Wending's share was 1,000 yuan each for cash and written guarantee, approximately 500 yuan in cash and 2,000 yuan in written guarantee, and he is expected to be released on bail today (17th).</p>
<p>The Issue of Silver Usage in the Silverware Industry</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of silver usage in the silverware industry in this county, the County Chamber of Commerce requested the Ministry of Finance in December last year to make changes to the regulations on the management of silver usage for silver products. After the telegram was sent, the Ministry approved it, roughly stating that the regulations on silver usage for silver products stipulate that chemistry should be used as raw material, and that the amount of pure silver contained in those that must be made of pure silver should not exceed 30% to show restrictions. After receiving the approval, the Chamber of Commerce immediately transferred it to the Gold and Silver Industry Association for notification. After receiving the letter, the Association immediately called a special meeting of all members, stating that the manufacture of silver products and silver ornaments, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, requires coordination and is difficult to manufacture. Therefore, all members were convened to hold a special meeting. Since the silverware industry in Shanghai also scheduled a meeting on the 23rd of this month, they unanimously called for. Zhang Shanqing, Cheng Fangren, and Ma Guanghui were selected to attend the meeting in Shanghai. If necessary, representatives must also be sent to Beijing to petition in order to achieve the purpose of changing the regulations on the management of silver usage for silver products.</p>

<p>Nanhui Rice Shop Robbed</p>
<p>On the night of the 11th, six families, including Sheng Langchun and Sheng Bujin, in Shengjialangxia, north of Jiaxing, were robbed and suffered no goods. They are reporting and requesting a survey to investigate the thieves. Around half an hour before the morning of the 15th, more than ten robbers suddenly came to the Mingsheng Rice Shop in Xishi, Nanhui Town, north of Jiaxing. They dug into the door and first scared the shop assistants Fei Shiying and the watchman, and prohibited them from making a sound. The thieves who were guarding the door twisted the night watchman Jiangbei Asan. Zhang Renxiang, the accountant, heard the sound and hid, but forgot to take the leather suitcase next to his pillow, which was stolen, containing more than 40 yuan in paper money. Then they used tools to dig open the foreign box in the shop, which contained more than 600 yuan in paper money, all of which were stolen. Finally, they packed more than ten bags of copper coins into another bag and fled towards the Chaiquan Port. After the thieves left, the town police station was reported to dispatch police to pursue them, but the thieves had gone far and were not caught.</p>

<p>Crowds of Visitors to the Cultural Relics Exhibition</p>
<p>The cultural relics exhibition hosted by the Provincial Library officially began at 1:00 PM on the 15th. In order to avoid crowding, the library specially distributed admission tickets in advance, divided into regular tickets and designated date tickets. In addition to a portion directly distributed by the library, the rest were distributed by the Central Bookstore Zhenjiang Bookstore, Dahua Hotel, Wusan Library, and other places. The exhibition time is from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Yesterday was the first day of the exhibition, and the number of visitors was extremely enthusiastic, estimated to be no less than a thousand people. Each exhibition room in the library was staffed with receptionists. If the audience did not understand, there were ancient dictionaries on the wall. Jinshi was displayed in the cabinets in the south room, which was the most precious. Among them were several pieces of Jiading bamboo carving, one of which was "Zhu He's Pen Sea." Zhu He was the ancestor of Jiading bamboo carving, and few of his extant works are seen. This piece can be called a masterpiece and is said to be worth more than 100,000 yuan. One is Shen Lian's "Peach Boat." Shen Lian is also a famous bamboo carver in Jiading. The boat was hand-carved by him with exquisite knife skills and is also of high value. The rest, such as Bai Yangshanren's "Aloeswood Mountain", are all rare and excellent works. The next is pottery, most of which is lent by Chu Nanzhi, a Yixing scholar. Among them is a "Gongchun Skinny Pot," which is a pottery from Yixing. Only this one exists in China. Once a British person was willing to cut it off for 20,000 yuan, but he was rejected. It can be imagined how much Chu valued this pot. Other utensils, such as Saint Si's pottery cup, are also extremely valuable. The calligraphy and paintings are particularly beautiful, with countless works to admire. Tang Yin Qiu Shizhou's collaboration of ladies, Zheng Banqiao's ink orchids, etc., are the best of the best. The two large rooms and four small rooms downstairs are all calligraphy and paintings by modern celebrities, as well as modern printed painting albums, edition pieces, the first issues of various magazines, and newspapers from various countries.</p>

<p>— Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>Research on Insecticides</p>
<p>Since research on pest control has gradually progressed, research on insecticides has attracted attention. In various countries in Europe and America, lead arsenate, Paris green, potassium cyanide, and other chemicals are commonly used. Under the circumstances of underdeveloped industry and low prices of agricultural products in China, it is not economical to use industrially manufactured insecticides purchased from foreign countries. Therefore, it is necessary to research domestic plant insecticides. In recent years, the use of croton powder for insect control by the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Entomology has shown significant effectiveness. However, there are many domestic plants that can be used as insecticides, but it is easier to achieve results if biological research institutions undertake this work. In the future, as hygiene undertakings progress, even for eliminating mosquitoes, domestic insecticides will need to be utilized.</p>
<p>Research on Other Economic Plants</p>
<p>In addition to the above-listed economic plants, there are many other economic plants that need to be researched, such as extracting iodine from seaweed, bacterial culture media, forage grass, cork, legumes, green manure, leguminous shrubs in tea gardens, tannin raw materials, rubber sources other than rubber trees, honey plants, and so on, which are too numerous to mention individually. The existing Central Agricultural Experiment Station lacks the manpower and resources to research these, and the government should entrust and subsidize biological research institutions to actively investigate and research them.</p>
<p>Research on Plant Diseases</p>
<p>Besides pests, plant diseases are caused by pathogens. The extent of damage caused by the two is difficult to compare. For example, the loss of wheat due to wheat rust is enormous. Potato blight once caused the Great Famine in Ireland. The chestnut blight in the United States will completely exterminate the American chestnut. White pine blister rust has also made it almost impossible to plant this most valuable forest tree in the eastern United States. The fungal diseases of agricultural and forestry products in China have not yet been extensively investigated and studied, and this research must start from the fundamental mycology aspect of plant pathology. Currently, two or three biological research institutions are working hard on preliminary research, and it is necessary to support and encourage them so that they can progress quickly.</p>
<p>Research on Fermentation Bacteria and Bacteria</p>
<p>Fermentation bacteria and bacteria are greatly related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Pasteur's research results were enough to repay France's reparations to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War with surplus. The study of soil bacteria is of great importance to agriculture. The alcohol industry, beet sugar industry, wine-making industry, black tea manufacturing, soy sauce manufacturing, etc., are all related to the study of fermentation bacteria and bacteria. Our nation is the most capable of utilizing fermentation bacteria and bacteria without scientific methods. The manufacturing of soy sauce, fermented bean curd, rice noodles, red noodles, and preserved eggs are all unique techniques of our nation, unknown to European and American nations. In modern times, only Japan has made efforts to study fermentation organisms using scientific methods. Our country should catch up and vigorously engage in this research, as its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is incalculable.</p>
<p>Survey and Research of Aquatic Organisms</p>
<p>The coastline of China, from Bohai Bay in the north to Guangzhou Bay in the south, spans thousands of miles from the north temperate zone to the tropics. The abundance of aquatic products is self-evident. And the consumption of aquatic food by the Chinese people is also higher than that of other nations. Every year, there is a large import surplus of aquatic products from Japan. In the past, there was no shortage of people studying aquatic science, but they lacked in-depth research on the taxonomy of aquatic animals and plants. Therefore, although fisheries schools have been established over the years, they have not benefited China's fishery industry at all. Not only have they failed to increase the production of aquatic products with the results of ecological research, but also the survey of China's aquatic products cannot be carried out. Furthermore, the problem of iodine production, which is related to medicine and national defense, has not been addressed because there are no experts in seaweed research. Moreover, China is famous for its fish farming industry, but the types of fish raised are limited. If scientific research is added, the types of fish that can be raised should be more than this. In addition, the consumption of kelp in our country is very high every year, and all of it comes from Japan. However, the Japanese have already transplanted kelp in the Dalian area with excellent results. On other coasts of our country, it may also be possible to try transplanting this type of seaweed. Moreover, for the prevention and control of mosquitoes, special types of fish that prey on mosquito larvae in the water are now mostly cultivated. This type of research is of great importance to hygiene. For example, the miasma of Yunnan and Guangdong has been proven to be malignant malaria. And when severe malaria is prevalent, it often leads to the complete death of the population of the entire county. In the future, if one wants to develop the tropical border areas, one must start by controlling mosquitoes. It is said that the fall of the Roman Empire was due to malaria, and the extinction of the Maya culture in Central America was also due to yellow fever mosquitoes. Today, in the vicinity of Rome, Italy, mosquitoes are controlled by transplanting fish. This type of research is also an urgent matter of government today. Fortunately, there are many aquatic zoologists in the country, and there are also experts in seaweed research. Currently, the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica has begun large-scale research on oceanography and the survey of aquatic products. The government should fully support it and encourage other biological research institutions to engage in this research. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Unveiling Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Unveiled, Hu Yunqiu Reported on Preparations, Wang Xiaolai and Others Gave Speeches, City Lowered Flag</p>
<p>The Tomb of Nameless Heroes in Miaohang held its unveiling ceremony at ten o'clock yesterday morning. The mayor unveiled the tomb, and the city lowered its flag. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees The attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession Wang Xiaolai, as well as Yu Qiaqing, Kui Yanfang, Hu Yunqiu, Mao Heyuan, Li Dachao, and representatives from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles, totaling over 400 people. The venue and along the route were protected and maintained by over 200 security team members, police officers, and Boy Scouts from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement The venue was in Miaohang. The organizers stipulated that all participants must wear badges, so badges were checked at the entrance of the China Leprosy Hospital and the entrance to the venue. Those without badges could purchase them. An altar was set up in front of the tomb, with the Party and National flags and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen placed on it, along with flowers. In the center of the tomb, a memorial tablet for the soldiers who died in the January 28th Incident was hung, with red silk and black characters, and flower wreaths and baskets presented by various sectors were lined up.</p>
<p>Mayor Unveiled The conference was chaired by Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Gongquan. After the formalities, the mayor first cut the red silk covering the tomb door with silver scissors, opening the tomb door. The unveiling ceremony was completed. The mayor, accompanied by the presidium, went inside for a week's tour, and then returned to the original place. Yu Qiaqing reported that, ladies and gentlemen, today is the unveiling ceremony of the tomb of the soldiers who died in the January 28th Incident. All sectors have come from afar to participate, which proves the patriotism of all sectors towards the soldiers. The cloudy and rainy weather proves that even the heavens are weeping. We are here today to participate in the unveiling ceremony, and we should inherit the legacy of the martyrs so as not to be ashamed of them.</p>
<p>Preparations Next, Hu Yunqiu reported on the preparations, saying, ladies and gentlemen, you are probably well aware of the initiation of the construction of the Tomb of Nameless Heroes. This tomb project began after the ceasefire and has been under construction for four years. It was originally planned to be unveiled on the fourth anniversary of the January 28th Incident, but due to the internal construction, it was only able to be held today. The founding committee believes that the construction of this tomb is an expression of national spirit and should not be overly simple. It is hoped that all sectors will donate more to express the admiration of the masses. In the future, for permanent preservation, it will be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Government for management.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, saying that the Tomb of Nameless Heroes is the resting place for heroes who sacrificed for the nation. Because their names are unknown, they are named with the words "Nameless" to commemorate the glorious deeds of the nation. Wang Xiaolai followed with a speech, briefly stating that we, as businessmen, should organize in the form of unlimited companies with unlimited spirit, promote the inherent spirit of the nation, and strive for the strength of the nation.</p>
<p>Zhang's Speech Zhang Zhizhong gave a speech, saying that he was one of those who personally experienced the January 28th battle, so he came from Beijing to participate in the unveiling of the Tomb of Nameless Heroes. In that battle, in Miaohang alone, a regiment of people sacrificed in the artillery fire, which shows the intensity of the battle. Although I am here today to participate and gather with people from Shanghai in front of the Tomb of Heroes, I feel deeply ashamed that even in the midst of the fierce war, I failed to sacrifice for the country and the people. After the speech, he shouted "Long live the Republic of China, long live the Kuomintang of China, and may the spirit of the nameless heroes never die!" and then the ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Half-Mast for Mourning The Vice President of the Executive Yuan sent a couplet to the Tomb of Nameless Heroes. In addition, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, former Commander of the Fifth Army Zhang Zhizhong, former Garrison Commander of Songhu Dai Ji, former Commander of the 88th Division Yu Jishi, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, China Flying Society, China Aviation Association, and others sent flower baskets and wreaths. The entire city lowered its flags to mourn.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Tomb Road The Tomb of Nameless Heroes is located in the central district of Miaohang Town, covering an area of over 50 acres. The entire outline is shaped like a sword, with the main part of the tomb hall at the end of the sword handle. The main road in the middle is the body of the sword. The flag pole road that crosses the main road is parallel to the front of the tomb hall, which is the image of the sword guard. The entire architectural style is simple and solid, decorated with Chinese floral carvings, quiet and elegant. The tomb hall is a slightly rectangular three-dimensional building, standing on a large stone platform that is 128 feet wide and 110 feet deep. There are 15 stone steps on the four sides of the platform, divided into three layers. The front is about 30 feet wide. There is a semi-circular pit in the hall, with a stone sarcophagus in the middle, which is the place to bury the remains of the nameless heroes and soldiers who died. A stone tablet stands at the rear, with a large red flag bearing the inscription "Spirits of the Soldiers Who Died in the January 28th Incident". Those who come to pay their respects will spontaneously generate a heart of admiration. The upper part of the tomb hall is adorned with the four characters "义薄云天" (Righteousness Piercing the Clouds), handwritten by Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government. The stone tablet inside the hall has the six large characters "Tomb of Nameless Heroes". The entire project took two and a half years, designed by engineer Dong Dayou, and contracted by Jiuji Construction Factory for over 66,000 yuan. The nearby Sijing Temple is the temple from which Miaohang got its name. It was destroyed in the artillery fire of the January 28th Incident, and is still being rebuilt by the locals through fundraising, and has not yet been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Wei and Li Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Wei Carried Hu's Handwritten Letter to Beijing to Present to Chiang</p>
<p>Wei Daoming, former Minister of Judicial Administration, and Li Xiaosheng, member of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, took the postal ship Conte Verde from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai at around 7:00 yesterday morning, docking at the Zhaoshang North Wharf. Wang Sima, President of the Second Special District Court, and Liang Renjie, President of the High Court Branch, welcomed them. Wei and Li disembarked at around 8:30 and went to their residences to rest. Wei will go to Beijing today to report everything to President Chiang. Li will stay in Shanghai. Wei and Li met with reporters on the ship and made the following statements:</p>
<p>According to Wei Daoming, Mr. Hu Zhantang has decided to wait until the weather is warmer before going to Shanghai and then to Beijing. The only reason Mr. Hu delayed his trip north is that his health has not recovered. Mr. Hu suffered from climatic changes on his way back to China and was unwell. After returning to China, he suffered from two episodes of colds. Moreover, Mr. Hu's body is not suitable for cold weather. He previously lived abroad and moved from Germany to France for treatment for this reason. He has now decided to follow the doctor's advice and wait until the weather is warmer before setting off for the north. I am carrying a handwritten letter from Mr. Hu to President Chiang, which I will present in person in Beijing in the next day or two. The letter also states that he has decided to wait for spring to warm up before coming north. Mr. Wang Chonghui left Spain today on the North German Company's fast ship Scharnhorst No. 1 (according to North German Company, the ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on March 12). Wang will come directly to Shanghai. It has not yet been decided whether he will disembark when passing through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to Li Xiaosheng, Mr. Hu Zhantang had high blood pressure, which made him unwell, so he went abroad for treatment. He has now returned to China, and his blood pressure has indeed decreased, but his body has not fully recovered. After returning to China, he suffered from two episodes of colds, so he has not seen guests or gone out in recent days. The reports in the newspapers that Mr. Hu visited factories and met with relatives and friends were scheduled activities, but they have been cancelled due to his ill health. Mr. Hu has decided to stay in Guangdong for a short time and then return to Hong Kong. He will come north again when the weather is warmer. The rumor that he will go to Guangxi is not accurate. I came here purely to handle private affairs and do not plan to go to Beijing. As soon as I finish my work, I will return south. I have already submitted my resignation from the position of Minister of Personnel.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Li Xiangen, Director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Southern Section, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Carrying a Plan for Building Three Major Railways, He Will Go to Beijing to Consult the Ministry of Railways in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that Li Xiangen, Director of the Southern Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with Wei Daoming and Li Xiaosheng on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde from Hong Kong. He is carrying a plan for building three major railways in Guangdong and Guangxi and plans to go to Beijing in the next few days to consult with the Ministry of Railways and then go to Hankou to inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway before returning to Guangdong via Hunan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Li told reporters on the ship that he came to Beijing to meet with Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Railways, to request instructions on the construction of three major railways: Sanhe (from Sanshui in Guangdong to He County in Guangxi), Qin-Yong (from Qinzhou in Guangdong to Nanning in Guangxi), and Guang-Shan (from Guangzhou to Shantou). He plans to go to Beijing in the next few days to meet with Minister Zhang. After completing his official duties in Beijing, he will take a boat to Hankou to inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and then return to Guangzhou via Hunan.</p>
<p>Regarding the funding for the three major railways to be built in Guangdong and Guangxi, after the Ministry of Railways approved the central government to issue railway public bonds, the amount of public bonds to be allocated to Guangdong and Guangxi is now being drafted by the ministry to allocate funds. The Ministry of Railways sent Xia Guangyu, a member of the Railway Design Institute, to Guangdong last month to discuss with the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities and inspect everything. Xia will also return north after completing his work. As for the three major railways, all engineering plans and budgets have also been finalized. Guangxi has established a preparatory office for the construction of the Sanhe Railway in Wuzhou. The situation is similar for the Qin-Yong Railway. Lin Yinhao, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has ordered He Qifeng, Director of the Construction Department, to work with me and Li Luchao and Wang Renkang, Directors of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau. All of this is included in the construction plan, which I brought with me for Minister Zhang to consult and handle.</p>

During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves. It ended at around 10:00. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Banking Association, Money Exchange Association, Institute of International Affairs, International Trade Association, and other eleven public groups have also scheduled a grand tea party at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th to bid farewell to Ambassador Gu and Xu Shiying, the new ambassador to Japan. After Gu finishes his social engagements, he will take the French postal ship Chennusa on the 22nd with his wife and embassy secretary Shi Zhaoji to leave for France to take up his new post. If time permits before departure, he will return to his hometown of Jiading. According to a Xinxin News Agency reporter, the expenses of China's embassy in France have been appropriately increased by the government after the embassy was upgraded. There have also been slight changes in the staff. Xiao Jirong, the current counselor and chargé d'affaires of the embassy in France, has been transferred by the Ministry to serve as a counselor at the embassy in Switzerland, and his vacancy will be replaced by Guo Zefan. As for the relocation of the embassy, Chargé d'affaires Xiao has found a new building, which can be moved into for office after Ambassador Gu arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange Announces Opening Today <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Unified Bonds Have Not Been Printed, So Do Not Make New Transactions Temporarily, the Brokers' Association Resolved Two Remedial Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, after receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance, announced that it will open for trading today, but do not make new transactions temporarily. The Brokers' Association of the Exchange held a general meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved two measures to request the chairman for remedy. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Announcing the Opening Today</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange issued Announcement No. 22500 yesterday, stating that it received an order from the Ministry of Finance to open. The Ministry had previously sent personnel to work with the exchange supervisor to verify the reports submitted by the exchange, and after checking them one by one, it was found that there were no public officials or personnel of the Ministry engaging in speculation and manipulation. The exchange should be allowed to open as usual from the 17th of this month. However, the unified public bonds have not yet been printed, and the exchange of new and old bonds has not yet begun. The exchange should not make new transactions temporarily when it opens on the 17th to avoid obstacles during delivery. The order has been received, and the exchange will comply and open as usual on the 17th of this month. However, new transactions will be temporarily suspended. Spot transactions will also be temporarily suspended because new futures transactions are temporarily suspended. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Brokers Hold a General Meeting</p>
<p>The Brokers' Association of the exchange held a general meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday in the signing room downstairs in the exchange. All brokers, as well as President He Peiyuan, Vice Presidents Zhu Anfu and Qiu Lianggui, Directors Li Zisheng, Fu Weiyuan, Zhu Dingyi, Zhu Dajun, Liu Yunpan, and Ge Gengzu, attended. First, Chairman He Peiyuan read out the original letter from the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to the Brokers' Association and reported the purpose of convening the general meeting. Then, the discussion began. The public resolved to comply with the order of the Ministry of Finance to open for trading, but requested to open new purchases and equalize market prices, and to cancel the submission of spot goods. These two points were entrusted to President He Peiyuan and two others to visit Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Exchange, to request assistance. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m. In the evening after the meeting, President He Peiyuan and two others visited Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Exchange, to report on the meeting and request that the two remedial measures be resolved and forwarded to Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, for review.</p>
<p>The Exchange Is Ready</p>
<p>In addition to announcing the opening today, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has prepared everything for the opening yesterday, such as repairing the red number lights used to announce prices. It is reported that the various treasury bills and public bonds to be traded today will temporarily use the old names, but no new transactions may be made. For example, the public bonds and treasury bills that were sold before the suspension may be bought back now, and the public bonds and treasury bills that were bought before may be sold now, entirely to clear the previous accounts. After the unified public bonds are printed and the exchange of new and old bonds is completed, trading will begin again. The exchange has made nameplates for various public bonds of A, B, C, D, and E types specified in the unified public bonds, such as the Reconstruction Public Bonds and the Unified Public Bonds. The opening date will be determined by the order of the Ministry.</p>
<p>Notice from National Trust and Credit Bank</p>
<p>The Savings Department of the National Trust and Credit Bank issued a notice to customers with treasury bill interest savings deposits, stating that the bank has been providing services to the public, including the custody of various treasury bills and the collection of interest savings deposits, and has received generous support and patronage from all sectors, for which it is deeply grateful. Now, in order to balance the treasury's income and expenditure and improve the financial organization, the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue 146 million yuan of unified public bonds in the 25th year of the Republic of China to exchange for various old bonds. Therefore, the bank's treasury bill interest deposit has ceased to exist. A public notice is hereby issued requesting all customers with treasury bill interest savings deposits to bring their original passbooks and the original seal left at the bank to retrieve the original treasury bills held in custody to clear the procedures. As for the previous interest savings deposits, the bank has a special fixed deposit savings account with the same nature and interest rate as the treasury bill interest savings deposit. Customers can continue to renew the deposit according to the original term, or convert it to other savings deposits. If you do not wish to continue to deposit and wish to withdraw, the bank will handle it according to the interest rate set for current and convenient savings deposits, depending on the length of the deposit period, and will provide special treatment to thank you for your patronage. It is hoped that all customers will consider this and come to negotiate as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The presidium of the 7th Representative Congress of the Bar Association delivered an opening address, stating that the most important foundation of the association's work lies in strengthening the organic organization of the nation. According to our long-held observations, to strengthen the organic organization of the nation, it is enough that there is mutual love and understanding between the nation and its people, and among the people themselves. The association's movement for compensation for unjust imprisonments is a movement to promote mutual love between the nation and its people. The legal aid movement for the poor? Is a movement to awaken mutual love among the people, so as to form the most basic work of strengthening the organic organization of the country, with the upper and lower classes supporting each other and sharing the same virtues. Only lawyers can be good at using the law, and they can also eliminate the reasons that hinder the strengthening of the organic organization of the country in advance. Therefore, legal education, lawyer training, lawyer treatment, and various systems should be improved, and legal academics should be emphasized. Moreover, in the modern era when the free school of law has expanded from the field of civil law to the field of criminal law, lawyers must have excellent legal academics. However, in our country, even in the legal field, emphasis on legal exploration is not active enough, and the original lawyers only regard dull legal judgments as golden rules. How can this clarify the role of the law and eliminate the reasons that hinder the strengthening of the organic organization of the country? Therefore, the association also advocates the study of law. In short, the recent main work of the association, although divided into the movement for compensation for unjust imprisonments, the legal aid movement for the poor, and the movement to study law, is only one movement to strengthen the organic organization of the country. We are fortunate to have your wise counsel.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanruo's Speech</p>
<p>Municipal Government Representative Zhang Yuanruo delivered a speech, saying, “Brothers, I am very honored to represent the Shanghai Municipal Government to attend this grand meeting today. All of you present are leaders in the legal field and specialized scholars. Although I am usually very interested in law and enthusiastically promote it, I always feel that my talents are lacking. Now I just want to contribute a few superficial opinions. China has a long history, a vast territory, and a large population, but why can't we strengthen the national organization? As for this phenomenon today, I think it is only because it lacks an element, which is law. Because the country lacks this political element, the foundation of society cannot be laid for long-term stability and security. We want to make society evolve, there is only one point, that is, to change the society from one without laws and unscientific to one with laws and scientific principles. However, in order to avoid becoming empty talk, we must strive to carry out this work in the future."</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai's Speech</p>
<p>City Party Representative Tong Xingbai delivered a speech, saying, "Representatives, today the China National Bar Association is holding its 7th National Representative Congress in Shanghai. I am very happy to represent the Shanghai City Party Department and attend this grand meeting. You have all come from afar. I represent the City Party Department to express my greetings to you. Since the transformation of China, various popular groups and organizations have sprung up like mushrooms, but many national organizations are always scattered. However, the organization and spirit of your association are very good and can be regarded as a model for the people. You are all famous legal experts. I believe that in the future, on the one hand, we should further improve the legal system itself, and on the other hand, we should also instill legal concepts into the people, so that the people can understand the law and develop law-abiding habits. Only by spreading legal knowledge to the people can the promotion of the legal system be effective."</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Jianghai Customs Patrol Vessels Employ National Crew Members <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Has Agreed to the Engineers' Association's Request</p>
<p>The China Marine Engineers Association previously stated that the employment of foreigners on customs patrol vessels was a serious hindrance to the national system and a waste of national funds. It submitted reasons to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting the employment of national crew members. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has approved the request, and that the recruitment of foreign personnel will be stopped, and that as many nationals as possible will be hired. The Ministry of Finance's approval is recorded as follows: "Reply to the China Marine Engineers Association's submission regarding the request that the crew members of customs patrol vessels should be filled by nationals in order to recover interests and save national funds. I have read the submission. I have found that the customs authorities have already stopped recruiting foreign personnel. As for the employment of foreign drivers, this is because the Inspector General of Customs reported that it was difficult to find a sufficient number of suitable Chinese personnel at one time. Therefore, it was necessary to approve the establishment of a short-term contract system to temporarily employ a small number of foreign personnel to meet urgent needs. At the same time, many vacancies were still reserved to gradually recruit Chinese personnel. Recently, dozens of Chinese drivers have been hired, which has been reported to the Ministry's Customs Office by the Inspector General of Customs. In addition, all graduates of the maritime classes of the tax schools have also been assigned as reserve drivers and served on various patrol vessels. All of this shows the Ministry's intention to cultivate maritime talents and gradually replace foreign staff with Chinese personnel. Now that it is claimed that there are many specialized talents among the members of the association, they should apply for the position when the customs authorities recruit drivers or marine engineers. If they are qualified, they will be hired as much as possible. Please be informed of this reply."</p>

<h3 id="e92">江浙 Provinces to Appoint Committees to Survey Outer Sea Borders <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Lu Yanghao of Jiangsu Submits Proposal to Civil Affairs Office, Strongly Arguing that the Shengsi Islands Should Not Be Assigned to Zhejiang's Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Following the proposal by Zhejiang Province to place the Shengsi Islands, located off the coast of Jiangsu Province, under Zhejiang's jurisdiction, gentry member Han Zishi from Jiangsu, as well as the Fishermen's Associations of thirty-one counties, have repeatedly expressed their opposition. Academic institutions in China's aquaculture sector have also unanimously voiced their opinions, opposing the change. Recently, the Ministry of Interior has ordered the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to appoint committees for a joint survey. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has already appointed Xu Zhen, Commissioner of Nantong, to participate in the survey. Lu Yanghao of Jiangsu visited the Civil Affairs Office a few days ago to present his views on the outer sea border survey to Director Yu, and stated that the Zhejiang proposal is a division of Jiangsu's territory, not a simple provincial border dispute, and is of great importance to Jiangsu's territorial rights and the livelihood of its fishing industry. The original proposal is excerpted below: It is understood that the division of the outer seas between Jiangsu and Zhejiang was determined as early as the 29th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. Ye Ji and Yuan Erhuai, the left and right wing guerrilla commanders of the Dinghai Garrison in Zhejiang, and Ding Jichang and Guo Long, the left and right wing guerrilla commanders of the Suzhou Garrison in Jiangnan, jointly surveyed and erected a monument on Xiaoyang Mountain. The inscription on the monument stated the dividing mountain standard: "The maritime defense of Jiangnan is bounded by Maji Mountain. The ocean islands south of the foot of Maji Mountain are under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province. The maritime defense of Zhejiang is bounded by Dayang Mountain. The ocean islands north of the foot of Dayang Mountain are under the jurisdiction of Jiangnan Province. From west to east, the ocean surface mountains and islands are all based on these two mountains as the standard." The original monument still exists in the Laoshan Temple on Xiaoyang Mountain. It is verified that after this determination of the division of the outer seas between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the boundary has been maintained for a long time without dispute. According to Zhejiang Province's local chronicles, such as the Zhejiang General Chronicle, the Kangxi Dinghai County Chronicle, the Guangxu Dinghai Subprefecture Chronicle, and the Republic of China Dinghai County Chronicle, the affiliation of the larger mountain islands in the outer seas are all recorded and can be used as reference. Also, Zhu Zhengyuan, a candidate for prefectural magistrate during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, wrote "Illustrated Description of the Zhejiang Coast" and "Illustrated Description of the Jiangsu Coast," each with a volume of mountain and island tables. According to Zhu's table, the islands belonging to Dinghai match the mountain and island table listed in the Republic of China Dinghai County Chronicle. Therefore, the division of the outer seas between Jiangsu and Zhejiang has complete records that can be used for verification. The ocean surface has the clear boundaries of Maji and Dayang mountains, so there should be no disputes between the two provinces regarding the division of the outer seas. Unexpectedly, last year, the Ningbo, Dinghai, and Fenghua natives' associations in Shanghai of Zhejiang, and Zhao Cisheng, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District, suddenly proposed assigning the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang. Yanghao has successively written articles to address this and revealed the truth behind the proposed division. Now, I solemnly and sincerely declare to Your Excellency that the Zhejiang proposal is a division of Jiangsu's territory and cannot be regarded as a provincial border dispute. Previously, it was reported that the Executive Yuan had approved the assignment of the Shengsi Islands in Jiangsu to Zhejiang. Immediately, Mr. Han Zishi, Zhang Zhongren, Chen Taoyi, Tang Weizhi, Leng Yuqiu, Wang Dankui, and Yanghao sent separate telegrams to the Central Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior, strongly arguing against it. Soon, a reply telegram was received from the Ministry of Interior, acknowledging that the saying that the Executive Yuan had approved the assignment of the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang was entirely fictitious. The case is currently under joint investigation by committees from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Now, hearing that Jiangsu Province has dispatched Commissioner Xu Zhen from the Nantong District to survey the border, I respectfully offer a few personal opinions before the survey, as detailed below: The division of the outer seas between Jiangsu and Zhejiang was originally undisputed. Now that the Ministry of Interior has ordered the governments of the two provinces to appoint committees for a joint survey, it is actually giving the two provinces an opportunity to establish a more obvious and definite provincial boundary. Xu Gong Mountain and the northern half of Dayang Mountain, which belong to Jiangsu, have long been occupied by Zhejiang. It is proposed that Your Excellency propose the recovery of these territories during the border demarcation to complete Jiangsu's territory. Before the Ministry of Interior promulgates the regulations for surveying provincial, municipal, and county administrative regions, if the boundary lines have long been clearly defined, have never been disputed, and there are no inconveniences, the original regional boundaries should be maintained. Article 4 of the Ministry of Interior's regulations for surveying provincial, municipal, and county boundaries has clear provisions. It is proposed that Your Excellency invoke these provisions and insist on the boundary established by the joint survey of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 29th year of Kangxi, permanently adhering to the original case. The Zhejiang natives' associations in Shanghai proposed assigning the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang, using the pretext that "according to the reports from fellow natives residing on the islands of Shenshan and Sijiao." This was used as a disguise for expressing the opinions of the residents, but in reality, the residents of the islands had absolutely no such opinions beforehand, and strongly opposed it afterward. Declarations were published in the Shanghai Shenbao and the Jiangsu Research Monthly as statements. It is proposed that Your Excellency present the true intentions of the residents to the central government to expose Zhejiang's pretense. The vast ocean surface uses mountain islands as the standard for dividing the territory. What is even better than this is that the division of the boundary in the Kangxi era was based on the force of the Yangtze River and Qiantang River entering the sea, dividing the territory by the flow of shells. This is adopting the watershed of the Yangtze River and Qiantang River. It is truly a rational division of territory. If the people of Zhejiang insist on establishing a new boundary, it is proposed that Your Excellency propose using 30 degrees 30 minutes north latitude as the boundary for dividing the outer seas between Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The above are all reference opinions regarding the survey. As for the Shengsi Islands being the gateway to the Yangtze River, the protective screen for the six counties of Chongming, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, and Jinshan in Jiangsu, and Shenshan being Jiangsu's only fishing port, the islands belonging to Jiangsu are absolutely non-transferable territories. Your Excellency, as a Jiangsu native governing Jiangsu, has unparalleled insight. The various achievements in dispatching warships to protect fishing and strictly prohibiting all kinds of exploitative malpractices against fishermen over the years have long been known in the outer seas, so there is no need for Yanghao to add trivial details. The matter concerns Jiangsu's territorial rights and the livelihood of the fishing industry. Yanghao is not intelligent but offers a humble opinion, earnestly requesting Your Excellency to examine and verify it. Respectfully presented to Director Yu of the Civil Affairs Office, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Telephone Committee Sends Letters to Various Organizations, Unanimously Protesting Telephone Rate Increase <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Preparing for Final Sacrifice and Confrontation</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee of this city yesterday sent letters to various organizations, strongly protesting the telephone rate increase. The notice stated: "Greetings, the disguised rate increase by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession has been officially implemented starting March 1st. Despite repeated protests and opposition from this committee and various organizations, it remains ineffective. At a time when the market is declining and business is sluggish, we are already suffering from the difficulty of living in Shanghai. How can we bear another burden on top of frugality? In order to unify steps and cope with the situation as a whole, this committee has sent letters to the Public Concession, French Concession, Chinese Ratepayers' Association, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, First and Second Special District Citizens' Associations, and other organizations, urging them to strongly protest and prepare for the final sacrifice to confront the situation and achieve final victory. Time is of the essence. We urge everyone to rise up together and achieve the desired goals. In addition, various organizations have recently advocated increasing the basic number of calls. If your association expresses sympathy, we hope you will clearly respond so that we can share the same position and facilitate progress. This is a notice. We hope you will investigate and reply accordingly." It is also understood that the First Special District Citizens' Association, in order to request the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the concession to convene a ratepayers' meeting to discuss the telephone rate increase, has appointed Li Ao-kui, Yu Yao-qiu, Chen Jiu-feng, and five others as representatives to negotiate with the Ratepayers' Association tomorrow, demanding that the Municipal Council strongly urge the abolition of the approved measures in order to resolve the dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Ministry of Finance Reiterates Reward and Punishment Order for Confiscating Smuggled Silver <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Official Receipt Should be Issued for Confiscated Smuggled Silver; Private Confiscation Will be Prosecuted as Embezzlement</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously received confidential reports that police officers in various provinces and cities directly confiscated smuggled silver coins and silver items without issuing receipts, causing abuses. It immediately telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering the police officers under their jurisdiction that if they seize smuggled silver coins or silver items, they should be handed over to the local Public Security Bureau for handling. If there are those who deliberately conceal or intend to evade taxes, the Public Security Bureau should forward them to the court for prosecution in accordance with the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. However, for silver coins and silver items directly confiscated by the Public Security Bureau, receipts should be issued as proof. Police officers must not confiscate privately, and violators should be prosecuted for embezzlement to prevent abuses. Furthermore, personnel who have contributed to the seizure of smuggled silver coins or silver items should be given bonuses. It is proposed to handle the distribution of bonuses in accordance with the revised Measures for Punishing and Rewarding the Seizure of Smuggled Silver Coins and Silver Items. After the confiscated silver coins or silver items are sent to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications for exchange into legal tender, the bonuses will be distributed according to the following rules: If the seizure is made independently by customs or military police agencies, the bonuses will be doubled in accordance with the customs' reward method for informants without connections, that is, 60% for extraordinary meritorious service and 40% for ordinary meritorious service. If the customs receive information from informants and seize the smuggled items with the assistance of military police agencies, the bonuses will be doubled in accordance with the customs' reward method for informants with connections. The military police and informants will each receive 40%, and customs officers will receive 20%. If military police agencies receive information from informants and seize the smuggled items, the informants will receive 60% of the bonus, and the military police will receive 40%. If the customs seize the smuggled items based on information from informants, the informants will receive 60% of the bonus, and the customs officers will receive 40%. If the customs seize the smuggled items with the assistance of military police, the military police will receive 50% of the bonus, and the customs officers will receive 50%.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Mr. Pan Gongzhan Plans to Excavate Antiquities <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Intends to Distribute Discovered Pottery Fragments in Sets, Storing Them in Various Counties as Excavation Samples</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more antiquities have been discovered in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Artifacts have been unearthed in Jinshan, Yan City, Kunshan, Suzhou, Shanghai, Shangyu, Haiyan, Jiaxing, and other places. After examination by archaeologists, it is believed that the ancient Wu and Yue cultures were brilliant, and the discovered antiquities are different from those discovered in the north. This proves that ancient Wu and Yue had their own local culture. Last year, archaeologists Wei Juxian, Jin Zutong, Chen Zhiliang, and others visited Jinshan and Yan City to study the antiquities, and the materials obtained were very rich. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, believes that they are of great value and initiated the Jinshan and Yan City Antiquities Exhibition, which was held at the Municipal People's Education Center the day before yesterday. Over 10,000 people attended the exhibition in two days. Mr. Pan now believes that although antiquities have been discovered in various places, they are scattered and should be part of a comprehensive excavation plan in order to explore the traces of the evolution of ancient Wu and Yue culture. Therefore, he has drafted a plan to send the ancient pottery fragments discovered by Wei to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The Jiangsu Provincial Government will distribute complete sets of these various pottery fragments, five sets per county, to be displayed in the people's education centers or elementary schools in the five directions of east, south, west, north, and center. If similar antiquities are discovered in various places, excavation can be planned in order to seek comprehensive preservation and organization, so that the antiquities buried underground can be seen by us.</p>

<p>Hardoon Tenants Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The Hardoon Tenants' Joint Rent Reduction Association has scheduled a joint meeting for this afternoon. The notice states: "Greetings, since Shanghai has been affected by the economic downturn, all industries have been declining and life is difficult. Therefore, there has been a vigorous movement to reduce rent. Although the movement has been going on for two years, it has been effective. Most landlords have automatically reduced rent, and there are many cases of rent reduction through mediation. However, the Hardoon Company insists on its views, is rich and unkind, and has failed to make any concessions. Moreover, the rent it sets is expensive, and the conditions are harsh, which is unprecedented for any landlord. Therefore, we have no choice but to invite our fellow tenants who share our suffering to gather together and discuss a comprehensive solution. All Hardoon Company tenants are requested to take time out of their busy schedules to participate in order to achieve the goal of reducing rent. The joint meeting is scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 17th of this month (Monday) at the Citizen's Federation meeting place in the Tianhou Palace Bridge Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The matter concerns your vital interests. Please do not ignore it."</p>

Type B public housing villages may build thatched huts and bamboo and wood sheds, but three sides must leave open space of more than three meters wide, and the roofs must be covered with tiles or lead sheets and other non-combustible materials to prevent fires. All houses or sheds must be built three meters away from the road to prepare for future road widening. The construction area must not exceed 50% of the base area, and the height must not exceed one story. If these regulations are exceeded, the municipal government will collect land rent at a higher interest rate.

<h3 id="e107">Special District Rickshaw Association Holds Meeting of Licensees Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Resolved that Fees Should be Collected According to Regulations and Prices Should Not Be Reduced; Unrentable Vehicles to be Returned to Owners, Effective Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to the departure of most registered rickshaw pullers in the special district, the existing vehicles in each shop could not be fully rented out. The Special District Rickshaw Association has repeatedly negotiated with the Municipal Council to re-register the vehicles to avoid losses, but it has not been approved. Licensees often reduce the rent due to the inability to rent out the vehicles, which has a significant impact on other members. Therefore, the association specially convened a meeting of vehicle owners and licensees yesterday, chaired by Jin Chunlin. As a result of the discussion, it was resolved that the rental of vehicles should be charged in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council and that prices should not be reduced. If the vehicles cannot be rented out, they should be returned to the owners. If the owners refuse to accept them, a three-sided notice will be sent to the association for collection. The regulations will be implemented from February 16th. It is also reported that the association plans to request the Municipal Council to re-register rickshaw pullers within a few days.</p>

<p>Still Promoting National Martial Arts in Singapore</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central Martial Arts Academy, went abroad last August to visit Europe and the United States to inspect sports. After completing his work, he went to the Nanyang Islands and telegraphed the students of the physical education program established by the academy to perform national martial arts and basketball to promote and advocate them. At the same time, he raised funds for the school. Pang Yusen led more than a dozen students to the islands. Pang returned to China on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde due to school affairs that needed to be handled, arriving in Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 16th. Zhang is still in Singapore because he needs to lead the school's students to continue performing. Therefore, he will not return to China for the time being. The rumor that Zhang arrived in Shanghai on the 16th is a misunderstanding of Pang's arrival in Shanghai. It is heard that Zhang is still in Singapore because the school's students' performances have been excellent and warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese. After the performances are completed in Singapore, he will continue to travel to other places. It is expected that he will be able to return to China with the students in two months.</p>

Subsequently, on the 6th of this month, they went to Beijing to study the capital's municipal construction and major new buildings. After staying in Beijing for five days, they returned to Shanghai on the 11th and resided at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Albert. In addition to visiting the Guangming Electrical Appliance Thermos Factory on Qingyun Road in Zhabei in recent days, each member of the tour also visited major buildings and residential area architectural designs separately and freely. Having completed their tasks, they took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan ship at 4 p.m. yesterday, left Shanghai for Hong Kong, and then transferred back to Guangdong. According to Mr. Zhu Shaoji, a member of the tour who spoke to a reporter, the tour's decision to come north for study has provided a wealth of practical knowledge in architectural engineering, and they have benefited greatly. In the future, they will each contribute their knowledge to engage in the architectural engineering business and serve the country and society.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Trade Association sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Trade Association yesterday regarding the implementation of the metric system and the newly established dyeing prices. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, recently, due to the soaring prices of various raw materials such as "pigments" and "coal" needed by our industry, and the high cost, as well as the increasingly excessive and unrestricted lengths of silk cloth, it is a huge loss to calculate by the bolt. Therefore, it was resolved at the general meeting on the 14th of this month that all dyed silk cloth will be priced using the metric system from this year onwards, and a new dyeing price list has been established. The listed prices are all in line with the current economic situation and the policy of unified flat prices, and are based on "monthly settlement" for each industry to facilitate the flow of finance and materials and deeply balance the economic motive of the "silk" and "dyeing" industries. In addition to reporting to the Bureau of Social Affairs for record and sending personnel to obtain approval, we are sending 500 copies of the newly established dyeing price list for your association to check. Please forward them to the members of each group for their information and reply with the processing situation. Respectfully, to the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association.</p>

After the Supervisory Committee explained to all staff, it was decided to postpone it to February 23rd and 24th. Individual interviews will be convened again today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Explains the Significance</p>
<p>Members of the Supervisory Committee Wei Yifu, Ma Xun, Hu Renyuan, Lu Rongguang, Chen Shaoxian, Lu Hanqin, Wu Jizhong, Peng Hu, etc., convened China Merchants Bureau staff Zhu Zengxian, Wu Delin, etc., to explain the significance of the Ministry of Communications' resignation and screening examination.

<p>Screening Examination Postponed</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau staff screening examination was originally scheduled to be held at 9 a.m. yesterday at Minli Middle School, Dananmen, Zhonghua Road.

<h3 id="e115">Thieves Wreak Havoc at the Dongxin Bridge Entrance <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Two thieves squeezed and groped for wallets, and beat the victim after being caught.</p>
<p>Huang Haiping, a native of Hefei who is currently the Director of the Military Law Office of the 39th Army of the stationed Fujian Army and the Supervisory Committee Member of the Special Party Department of the 56th Division, and his adjutant and fellow townsman Wu Xiangli requested leave to return to their hometown. Recently, due to the expiration of their leave, they came to Shanghai from Wuhu by boat and temporarily resided at the residence of a friend named on Beishaxi Road to wait for a ship to return to their posts in Fujian. Huang and Wu took the French-operated Route 5 tram at 5 p.m. on the 14th from the North Railway Station. When they got off at the entrance of Baoyuli, Dongxin Bridge, in the French Concession, thieves Li Youcai (26 years old, native of Funing, residing at No. 9, Deyuli, Beijing Road) and Wu Liansheng (29 years old, residing at No. 7, Xinmin Road, Zhabei) happened to be on the tram and got off at the same time. Li was in front and Wu was behind, squeezing Huang in the middle.</p>
<p>They squeezed desperately, and Wu Liansheng reached into Huang's pocket and stole a wallet containing 15 silver dollars. At that time, Wu Xiangli, Huang's companion, happened to see it from behind. After getting off the tram, he informed Huang that he had been robbed and pointed out the thief. After Huang discovered it, he grabbed the thief Wu Liansheng and demanded the return of the stolen goods. Unexpectedly, the thief not only denied it but also acted aggressively and beat Huang. Wu Xiangli helped to restrain the thief. At this moment, the thief's accomplice Li Youcai came forward and pretended to mediate, insisting that Huang release Wu. Huang refused, and the two sides were arguing, attracting onlookers. Just then, Chinese Constable No. 367 and Russian Constables No. 83 and No. 86 from the French Concession Police Station</p>
<p>arrived on patrol.</p>
<p>After inquiring about the reason, they searched Wu Liansheng's body and found the original stolen wallet. They quickly took him and his accomplice Li Youcai to the police station. It was found that Youcai had committed theft before and had been sentenced to eight months in prison. Wu Liansheng had also been arrested for pickpocketing in the Public Concession and sentenced to three years in prison. He was released on the 17th of last month. Not long after his release, he colluded with accomplices to commit theft again, repeatedly committing crimes without repentance. He was also detained. The day before yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer of the Police Department, stated the case and requested a postponement to investigate whether other crimes had been committed before requesting an interrogation. It was also reported by Bao Tan Ma Changxin that the defendants were arrested</p>
<p>Investigation Process</p>
<p>and the stolen goods were presented as evidence. Then, the victim Huang Haiping stated that when he got off the tram, two people were squeezing him from the front and back, and he didn't know they were pickpocketing until his companion Wu Xiangli informed him that his wallet had been stolen. He grabbed the second defendant who was stealing. He was very fierce and ordered me to search his body. Finally, he asked me to go to the alley to talk, but I refused. I only wanted him to return my belongings. At that time, the first defendant first persuaded me to let go, then threatened me, and insisted on letting them go. Later, the patrolmen came and</p>
<p>found the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Wu Xiangli also testified that he saw Huang being robbed. When asked, Li Youcai only admitted to mediating and said that he did not know Wu and had no collusion in theft. Wu Liansheng said, "I have already served a three-year sentence, and I am afraid to commit crimes again. It was actually a thief wearing a blue coat and pants and a copper pot hat who committed the theft. The plaintiff insisted that I was stealing." He argued forcefully. The three Chinese and Russian patrolmen who were present were also questioned. Judge Zhang Chaozuo reviewed the testimony and decided to postpone the interrogation to the 19th. The defendants were remanded in custody. The trend of pickpocketing in Shanghai has always been extremely rampant. Since the arrest and imprisonment of the gang leader Xu Datou and others last year, this trend has subsided slightly. Recently, it has revived. It is hoped that the police authorities in the Chinese area will severely crack down on it to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>Special Commissioner Submits Resignation</p>
<p>Shi Weijun, the Special Commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, has been in the Bureau for many years and has handled all difficult foreign negotiations with great reputation and is known as a capable person. He has now submitted his resignation. In addition, Zhou Fengtu, the Joint Transportation Commissioner, although reappointed by General Manager Cai as the Deputy Director of the Business Department after resigning to former General Manager Liu, has sent a letter of resignation and has gone north to take up the new position of Deputy Director of the Accounting Department of the Jinpu Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>General Manager Cai Zengji's Written Statement</p>
<p>General Manager Cai Zengji of the China Merchants Bureau issued a written statement saying that the China Merchants Bureau has debts of about 40 million yuan and monthly losses of about 200,000 yuan. The current situation is dangerous, no different from the symptoms of the third stage of lung disease. Therefore, the central government specifically determined thorough rectification measures to treat it. A few months ago, the Executive Yuan handed it over to the Ministry of Railways, Industry, Finance, and Communications to jointly formulate the new regulations of the China Merchants Bureau, which were passed and implemented by the Yuan's decision. These new regulations are no less than the fundamental constitution of the China Merchants Bureau. The original text has been disclosed in the newspapers on the 16th. The regulations stipulate the various organizations and the number of staff of the China Merchants Bureau's head office and branch offices. Therefore, it is necessary to first establish a sound organization based on the new regulations before we can talk about rectification. The Ministry of Communications decided to take the first step in screening the staff of the head office to determine who should stay and who should leave in order to implement the new regulations. In order to avoid solicitation from all parties and strive for fairness, the examination measures were promulgated and scheduled. The examination committee members sent by the Ministry have also arrived in Shanghai ahead of schedule to preside over the matter. However, colleagues in the Bureau, due to the urgent examination time, did not have time to prepare for the examination and sent representatives to request that the examination period be postponed for one week to allow them to prepare calmly, and requested that when those who pass the examination in the future exceed the number of staff required by the Bureau, they should be submitted to the Ministry to determine a placement method. This is reasonable, and I asked Director Lu of the Navigation Administration Department to submit it to the Ministry on my behalf. The Ministry has approved the postponement of the written examination for one week. As for the oral examination, because the examination committee members sent by the Ministry are now in Shanghai, the Ministry advocated holding it first. It is heard that Director Lu decided to explain the first oral examination to colleagues at the Bureau's commemorative week this week. The policy of rectifying the Bureau's affairs and holding screening examinations has been decided by the central government. In this difficult period, under the circumstances of the Bureau, my personal responsibility is only to execute the government's orders. This is not only true for me, but anyone else in my position would do the same. I deeply hope that the Bureau's staff will also understand their own position. They cannot be compared to the staff of ordinary institutions. They are the staff of the government's communications agency. In this extraordinary period, they should have the responsibility to maintain the communications industry as much as possible. It is not permissible for a small number of people to disregard the government's orders for their own selfish interests and use resignation as a threat. If the Bureau's staff or anyone else has good ideas for rectifying the Bureau's affairs and the welfare of all staff, as well as the relief and aftermath of the laid-off staff, and contributes them to the government, I will forward them on their behalf and do my best to ask the government to adopt them, except for those that are unreasonable. If they are confused by the instigation of a small number of unscrupulous elements and attempt to undermine the rectification plan, the government will severely punish them once discovered. If the staff who are law-abiding and conscientious are subject to coercion, they can report the facts, and the government will also protect them. The government's painstaking efforts to rectify the shipping affairs and my responsibility should be understood by the Bureau's staff and the community. Regarding the rectification of the Bureau's affairs, on the passive side, we will first strengthen the organization of the head office and gradually establish credibility before we are qualified to negotiate with creditors and thoroughly rectify the debt repayment methods. The vast majority of the Bureau's assets have been mortgaged to creditors, so we must first have the lowest credibility to make creditors believe in the Bureau's future before we can approach creditors and realize the plans to rectify old debts and raise new capital. I previously decided to go to Beijing to meet with President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Acting Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications. They both personally instructed me to break through sentimentality and thoroughly rectify the China Merchants Bureau. The government will be an unlimited backer. All thoughtful and patriotic people should express sympathy for the government authorities' determination. The depth of the Bureau's illness, as mentioned above, has reached its limit. At the beginning of this rectification, without the determination to burn the boats and the spirit of King Yue of Yue in the Spring and Autumn Period to restore the country and the revival of Germany after the European War, we cannot reverse the crisis of the Bureau by striving to implement the central government's policy. But success depends entirely on the Bureau's staff who are well-versed in righteousness, cooperate sincerely, and rely on the community and the government as a strong backing. I am just a public servant of the people, doing my best to carry out their intentions.</p>

<p>Tang's Wife's Memorial Text</p>
<p>Tang's wife, Ouyang Lizheng's memorial text, is full of sorrow and twists and turns, and the words are beautiful and touching. It is worth transcribing the original text as follows: (Omitted above) Alas, the heavens are unkind, destroying my good man. Crying to the heavens and pounding the earth, my head is broken and my heart is shattered. My voice is hoarse and exhausted, and I prostrate myself to offer words. If your spirit is not ignorant, you should be here. Recalling from our marriage to this day, our love has been unwavering, and we have been happy together morning and evening. We have played the plain zither and filled the green liquor. Our lovely daughters and sons have surrounded our knees. We have often said that this happiness is not easy to obtain. We looked forward to growing old together and hiding in the mountains and rivers, hoping to stay away from arrows and avoid nets. How could we have known that from the September 18th Incident to the January 28th Incident, dragons and snakes would run on the land, and the killing intent would be great? You said that in times of national crisis, what could a family do? Every man is responsible, and there is no escape but death. He endured grievances and hardships and did not give in to public opinion. He used the negotiation table to resolve conflicts and had no regrets. Who would defend the country with weapons? He relied on his tongue alone to prevent the passing tide. The responsibility of the whole country was borne by his bare hands, and people still did not understand. Did you die for it? If you die, the country will prosper, and what is there to regret in death? The earth veins are exhausted day by day, and my heart is filled with endless sorrow. Alas, in the afterlife, we can be companions and become ghosts together. The heroic martyrs have a majestic spirit that pierces through the rainbow. As the spirit chariot is about to depart, I grieve for the burial mound. I present the last dried meat and wine and call upon the remaining soul in the emptiness. Soul, return, and partake of the food. Soul, return, and drink. Turning around, I cannot see you, and there is no hope of meeting again. If my body can be redeemed, I would not hesitate to die ten thousand times. Alas, how painful, how painful, we are separated forever. I think of the elderly mother above and pity the young children below. Without this feeling, I would die with you. I look at the southern mountains outside the door and think of the pine trees in the courtyard. My pain is deep and I lack the strength to speak, and my tears are exhausted and there is no blood left to continue. Soul, return, alas, pain, may you enjoy the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Funeral Today</p>
<p>Mr. Tang's coffin is scheduled to depart from the Shanghai Funeral Home at 10:30 a.m. today, pass through Xujiahui Road, Xujiahui Pa, Hongqiao Road, and arrive at the International Cemetery. It will be temporarily placed in the Cao Ting Cemetery. Tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m., it will be buried in the crypt. It is expected that many people from various parties will attend the funeral. The Tang residence has specially prepared cars for transportation. At that time, the plain cars and white horses will be extremely sorrowful.</p>

<h3 id="e124">With Rich Peach Blossom Flavor, Xu Qizhong's Bankruptcy Meeting <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Creditors Include Dance Hall Owners with Special Connections, Assets Include Clothing Valued at Over Four Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the 22-year-old son of Wu Xing's wealthy merchant Xu Guannan, who resides at No. 61 North Zhejiang Road in Shanghai, recently declared bankruptcy to the First Special District Court, claiming that he was unable to repay the huge debt of over 31,000 yuan for dance expenses, high-end restaurant bills, travel expenses, fashion, cosmetics, and other expenses owed to Saint Anna, Paramount, Atlantic, Jinlong, Daxia, He Han, Hongxiang, Sincere, and other businesses. The court accepted the case, and a creditors' meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details of the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Present</p>
<p>The creditors' meeting yesterday was held at the original location of the China Industrial Bank on the third floor of Nanjing Road. More than 20 people attended, including representatives from Li Han Car Rental, Sincere Department Store, Jinlong Western Restaurant, Paramount Hotel, Atlantic Hotel, Gaohe Women's Shoe Store, as well as Shen Liang (i.e., Mr. Hu), Ying Huizhen (brothel owner), and others. The debtor, Xu Qizhong, also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by the prosecutor Yu Lude and supervisor Wang Sifang, both accountants, appointed by the First Special District Court. The clerk of the First Special District Court, Ying Yeping, served as the recorder. First, prosecutor Yu announced the purpose of the meeting and inquired about the debtor Xu Qizhong's age and occupation. The response was that he was 22 years old, unemployed, and had previously studied at school. Then, accountant Shan Wang reported that the total amount of declared claims was 31,866 yuan, while the amount of claims present at the meeting today was only 3,416 yuan and 19 cents.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>After the reporting matters were completed, the discussion began. The creditor Ying Huizhen spoke first, stating that she had lent the debtor a total of 10,000 yuan in installments, all with promissory notes issued by the debtor. However, when questioning the debtor, he admitted to only borrowing 1,000 yuan, claiming that the promissory notes issued were for a special circumstance and were fictitious, which led to considerable dispute between the two parties. Then, the creditor Zhao Congyan from Li Han Car Rental spoke, citing Article 156 of the Bankruptcy Law, stating that the debtor owed the Atlantic Restaurant 1,000 yuan in dining expenses, the Daxia Car Rental Company 1,500 yuan in transportation expenses, and the Paramount and Saint Anna dance halls hundreds of yuan each, which clearly met the conditions of Article 1, which states, "Wasteful gambling or other speculative behavior that obviously reduces property," and has actually violated the criminal law.</p>
<p>Overview of Liabilities</p>
<p>Finally, prosecutor Yu persuaded both parties to make concessions and negotiated a compromise plan based on the reconciliation plan proposed by the debtor on the spot, pending a decision at the second creditors' meeting. Then, Zhao Congyan, Le Junze, and Ying Huizhen were elected as auditors, and the meeting was adjourned. The following is an excerpt from the liabilities and assets that have been declared, as recorded by accountant Wang Sifang: 1.

<p>China's Brilliant Performance Won the Final Rights, Chen Zhenhe Was Powerful and Scored Three Goals Alone</p>
<p>In the West Union Football Association World Cup match, China vs. Jewish, the match took place at the Recreation Ground at 3 PM yesterday. Two to three thousand people who admired their names went to watch the game. In the International Cup two years ago, the Jewish team defeated China 1-0. In recent times, the strength has changed greatly, and the Chinese team has many strong players, such as Zheng Fang and Wei Ai, so the game became one-sided. In the first half, China only had a 1-0 advantage. In the second half, the Jewish team still did not improve at all. The players of each team fought hard and were exhausted. The Chinese team took advantage of the situation to attack. Zhong Yongsen, Sun Jinding, and Chen Zhenhe succeeded one after another, defeating the Jewish team with six goals. In the overall result, China won 7-0 and won the final rights. They will compete with Portugal for the championship. The following is a record of the lineup of both parties:</p>
<p>Zhong Yongsen First Recorded</p>
<p>Before three o'clock, both sides had already taken the stage in military uniforms. Loose feet started, and when the referee took off the silver horn and sounded, both sides immediately formed a formation to fight. The enemy general Bailinji dialed Adu and sent it to the front line. Jie Kebu got the ball and rushed straight, and Jiang Li's two inside guards were as solid as copper walls. They intercepted it halfway, and Cao Qiuting invaded the border, making great strides, and even fell into the enemy's defense line. He passed it remotely to the central army, and Zhong Yongsen waited with his gun in his arms, opening the top flower and setting the first record. This ball was only two minutes away.</p>
<p>Sun Iron Leg Swept the Ground</p>
<p>The Chinese team won the first battle, and the whole army was inspired and full of vigor. Jia Youliang sought to obtain the border, and attacked by attacking the detour. Cao Qiuting raised his foot and knocked on the door, and the whistle was removed from the fifth zone. Calmly and calmly, he hit it from afar. Xiao Cao was injured in the ankle and left the field due to mutual collision with Horas Ding for the ball. Before long, he still came back to fight. Zhong Yongsen raised the flag and rebelled, fighting against the enemy with soldiers, and the soldiers came to the enemy's hinterland, and cold arrows were released. The goalkeeper waved his arms and waved out. Qiuting hurried up and transferred to the center. Sun Tie Leg swept the ground, and the head of the foot was accurate, and the good opportunity was lost.</p>
<p>Twelve Yards, Jewish Spared</p>
<p>The enemy's M.Greenburg crossed the line to build a road, and was too anxious to compete for the ball. He was injured and fell to the ground. He was supported by his companions to leave the field. Xiao Hei Tan won the three armies and rose in the Central Plains. He went deep into the tiger's den alone. G. Greenburg tried to stop him. The ball crossed Hei Tan and Sun Tie's footsteps were slow, and he could not catch up. M. Greenburg recovered from his injury and took the stage, and the blue-eyed children around him applauded to welcome him. Xiao Hei Tan made a comeback and threw the soil back in. Huo Leisi hurriedly touched the ball in his hands, and he was penalized for twelve yards. Sun Tie Leg played the role of a broker, and the ball hit the right corner of the net, but was blocked by the goalkeeper, becoming a wild ball. Before long, the first half ended, and China took the lead with one goal.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhong Second Test</p>
<p>After the lemon, we changed places to fight again. The Jewish team planned to fight to the death and wash away its previous shame, but its counterattack was very fierce, but it was only a flash in the pan, and it slumped again. Cao Qiuting advanced on the left, and Zhong Yongsen released Leng Xiao secretly. G. Greenburg blocked not far away, and Xiao Zhong tried the knife again, and Ying Sheng entered the net, making two. Jia Youliang raised troops again, and the ball bounced back from the door post. At this time, the Jewish team besieged our army, but fortunately, the defense was effective and did not suffer any harm. Sun Jinshun led his troops on an expedition, and with a knock on the door, the ball bounced off Hollestein's body and hovered in front of the goal. Zhong Yongsen rushed out from the diagonal wrap and swept the ground, and then reported the hit, with the score being three to zero.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe is Familiar</p>
<p>At this point, the Jewish team had fought to the point where people were trapped and horses were exhausted. They only had parrying and no counterattack, so dangerous situations arose frequently, and the ball often hovered in the territory. Jia Youliang transported troops on the border, and Sun Zhongshun received grass and delivered food, coordinating before and after, and transferring them to Hei Tan. Three passes and five passes, directly to the front of the enemy's city. Xiao Hei Tan lived up to expectations, and with a springy foot, the ball went straight into the corner of the net and returned in triumph. Although the Jewish team struggled extremely hard, they were ultimately inferior and difficult to develop. Chen Zhenhe was familiar with the road, led the troops and guided them, and after passing through the corresponding area, he transferred them to Jinshun, and the enemy's door was trapped again when Tie Leg started.</p>
<p>Seven to Zero, Eliminate the Jewish</p>
<p>The Jewish team lost its position repeatedly, and the whole army was angry and crowned. The actions gradually became rough. Bailinji raised troops in the central army, and Ges Linbu and Pang Queer assisted from the left and right. Like a tiger with wings, they even crossed the three lines of defense of our army. Unfortunately, Zhang Rongcai was agile and could defuse the danger by blocking high and low. Sun Xuan led the three armies on a long expedition and was blocked by the goalkeeper. He rushed up and scored again. Chen Zhenhe threw the soil to the enemy's Chen again, partnered with Sun Tie Leg, and broke through the three passes in a row, breaking through the enemy's formation again. Suddenly, the silver horn rang for a long time, and both sides rested their weapons and collected their troops. China eliminated the Jewish with seven to zero and won the final rights.</p>

<p>Mai Ling vs. Eagles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association's Group A Pirates vs. Xie Hing tonight will be an amazing battle. There will also be Mai Ling vs. Eagles, competing for the right to review Group A and B. The four games are listed in order on the left:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>You You Wins Donghua Jiajia 66-41</p>
<p>All Black Wins Qun Yi Jiayi B 39-37</p>
<p>In the two games last night, the first game was You You vs. Donghua in Group A. You You was led by Xu Wenkui to command the three armies, and Donghua was unable to raise its head from beginning to end. As a result, it was defeated by You You with 41 to 66. The All Black Qun Yi in Group B of Jiayi, after a fierce struggle, the victory was determined. All Black won the chief position in the department with 39 to 37. The war report of the two games is recorded as follows on the left:</p>
<p>All Black Wins the Treasure, Qun Yi Loses</p>
<p>The All Black and Yi teams are equally powerful in Group B of Jiayi. They met last night, and both sides felt the determination to win and competed for the victory in the department. In the future, they will compete for the championship with the chief of Group A, so in the battle, they were all cautious and dealt with each other. Between offense and defense, they were very meticulous. The first half ended with 21 to 16, with All Black taking the lead.</p>
<p>The generals of Qun Yi were invigorated in the sound of the re-battle, and All Black also did not give in. All Black once took the lead with 31 to 22. After that, Lu, Dong, and Tao of Qun Yi made achievements and chased to a draw. At this time, the battle situation was tense, rising and falling, 30 to 30, 33 to 33, and then 35 were equal again, and then 37 were presented. In the midst of the difficulty of distinguishing Xuan Chi, Zhou Zhi scored a goal in the diagonal, and just when the gong sounded, the time was up. All Black won with 39 to 37 and took the chief position in the department.</p>
<p>You You Works Hard, Donghua Loses</p>
<p>At the beginning of the battle between the two armies, Xian thought that Donghua could win, because the brave like Mai Ling should be defeated. But who knew that something unusual happened, and after three or four rounds of competition, Xu Wenkui broke into the east and explored the west, and Donghua's basket was frequently attacked, and Sun Huipi took advantage of his tall stature to take advantage of the fire and rob, causing the score to increase and accumulate. In Donghua's formation, only Feng Nianhua made some achievements, and Chen Lu's two generals also made little contribution. In addition to defensive work, Sun Baoqing also had no confidence in free throws. At the end of the first half, You You was 35, and Donghua was 15. As a result, You You won 66 to 41. Xu Wenkui scored as many as 28 points in the whole game. Under strict surveillance, it was determined that it was difficult to achieve. It was not easy for Feng Nianhua to get 20 points.</p>

Shifting to the middle again, Gaoqiao's center forward once again went solo and scored another goal. However, Yiming's morale did not decline at all, but unfortunately, repeated attacks were unsuccessful.

<p>The Basic Unit is the Regiment as the Smallest Unit</p>
<p>——Exceptions for Remote Provinces and Cities——</p>
<p>The second National Scout Grand Review and Jamboree of the China Scout General Association was originally scheduled to be held in the capital last October. However, due to the Ministry of Finance's funds not being allocated, it was indefinitely postponed. The association has now received all the funds approved by the central government and has also received them from the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, it has begun to prepare according to the original plan and is scheduled to be officially held in the capital on October 10th of this year. The methods for participation by provinces and cities have also been formulated, and the local councils were instructed yesterday to prepare as soon as possible and to fill in the exact number of participating scouts from the date of receipt of the order to the end of May, and report them, etc. It has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The participation methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice of Participation: The General Association yesterday issued a notice to all councils stating, "In order to comply with orders, after reviewing the Association's decision to hold the second National Scout Grand Review and Jamboree in the capital on the Double Tenth Festival this year, it has been submitted to the central government for approval. A special order is issued with participation methods and registration forms, which should be jointly forwarded by the association, the party headquarters, and the education authorities to their subordinates to prepare as soon as possible, and from the date of receipt of the order to the end of May, fill in the exact number of participating scouts and report them for verification. Please comply with this order."</p>
<p>Participation Methods: Participation methods for the second National Scout Grand Review and Jamboree of the China Scout General Association: Participating units: The Association calculates participating units by province and city. Each province and city must recommend one general leader to be solely responsible. As for the basic unit, it is stipulated that the regiment formed in accordance with item 4 shall be the standard. Those with less than one regiment shall not attend. For example, if Province A has twenty regiments and one company, only twenty regiments can attend, and this one company, which is less than one regiment, cannot send anyone to attend. Also, if Province B is one company and Province C is one squad, then this one company and squad cannot attend, because the basic unit of attendance is the regiment as the smallest unit (but border provinces can be accommodated). Each province and city must first allocate and arrange according to the organization in item 4 after the Association has verified the number of people, so as to avoid temporary confusion. However, the original regimental flags of each regiment, even after the various regiments have been mixed to form a new organization, must still be brought for review. People selection: Those who have obtained badges above the elementary level (border provinces can be accommodated). Number of people: Each province and city shall stipulate its own selection methods and shall submit the exact number of participants to the Association for verification from the date of receipt of the order to the end of May (if a scout leaves the regiment before the review and cannot attend, they shall not be included). Temporary organization for the review and jamboree: Seven to nine people are a squad, including the squad leader and deputy squad leader. Six squads are a company. Three companies are a regiment. Those with less than one regiment may form a regiment by mixing various units before they can participate.</p>
<p>Review Location: The registration form stipulates the following: General Leader, Deputy Leader (indicate Boy Scout or Girl Scout), Coach (indicate Boy Scout or Girl Scout), Service Personnel and Coaches, Boy Scouts (organized as follows: Regiment, Company, Squad, Number of people with elementary badges), Campsite (bell-shaped or house-shaped). As for the review location, according to news from the General Association, it has been generally decided to be in the area of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and the Central Stadium, etc. A careful survey will still need to be conducted recently to make the final decision.</p>

The school is located near the Temple of Literature Park, with fresh air. Most of the teachers are professors from universities in this city, with both extensive knowledge and experience. The number of students per class is limited to 20, and the Dalton Plan is the main teaching method. The first term of the school has ended, and the results are very good. The second enrollment is now underway. The school term was originally scheduled to be three months per term. However, in order to accommodate the requests of students from all walks of life, it was decided at the second school affairs meeting that, starting from the first term, the study period for the four English classes (junior, middle, high, and special) will be extended by half a year, and starting from this semester, a fee reduction method will be formulated. In recent days, the number of students enrolling in the school has been quite enthusiastic, and most classes are about to be full. School starts on the 12th, and classes start on the 14th.</p>
<p>Shanghai Girls' High School: Shanghai Girls' High School on Zhizaoju Road, Xiejiao, in this city started school on the first of this month and started classes on the tenth. The number of students this semester has increased greatly. It is reported that the teachers in charge of the school's senior high school vocational courses, general courses, literature special courses, art normal courses, Chinese and English typing, and adult continuing education classes are all graduates of famous universities at home and abroad, and they have both excellent knowledge and experience. This semester should have even faster progress. It is reported that there are still vacancies in the above courses, and students can take the exam upon arrival.</p>

<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer was deeply moved by Mrs. Bergmann's kindness and warm words, so he asked the children: "Are you willing to go?" "We are," they replied in unison. An hour later, led by Franz, they went to participate in John Brooke's simple funeral, performing their duties as part of the group.</p>
<p>The small house looked quiet, comfortable, and full of sunlight, just like when Meg entered as a bride ten years ago. However, at that time, it was early summer, and roses were in full bloom everywhere. Now it is autumn, and the withered yellow leaves fell rustling in the wind, making the branches on the trees even more bleak. The bride is now a widow, but that same quiet beauty still shone on her face. The solemn beauty of a devout person who has suddenly encountered a great disaster, knows that it cannot be saved, and can console themselves, directly comforted those who came to mourn.</p>
<p>"Ah, Meg! What kind of cultivation do you have that enables you to endure this so much?" Shu said to her softly, because she came to the door to greet them, revealing some well-intentioned smiles of invitation, and did not change her usual gentle demeanor, but was even more gentle.</p>
<p>"Dear Shu, the love that has made me happy for the past ten years is still my support. It will not die out. I now feel that John is even more mine," Meg said softly. In her eyes, a kind of gentle confidence was so clear and beautiful that Shu could not help but believe her and feel that the immortality of love was like what she possessed, and truly thank God for the gift.</p>

<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>Our national finances have generally suffered from annual deficits of approximately 140 to 150 million yuan over the past five to six years (with the deficit reaching a staggering 217 million yuan in the 19th year of the Republic). In addition to increasing new taxes, the government has resorted to raising debt to fill the gap. Before the 16th year of the Republic, foreign debt exceeded domestic debt. Thereafter, domestic debt increased while foreign borrowing ceased, which is a symbolic indication of progress in our nation's debt policy. According to the "Financial Yearbook of the Ministry of Finance" (published in September of the 24th year of the Republic), as of the 15th year of the Republic, domestic debt totaled 381,166,243 yuan, and foreign debt totaled 3,034,961,374 yuan. Compared to the total amount of public debt, the former accounted for 11.15%, and the latter for 88.85%. From the 16th year to the 21st year of the Republic, the amount of debt raised totaled 1,256,915,864 yuan for domestic debt, accounting for 90.77%, and only 30,729,045 yuan for foreign debt, accounting for 9.23%. From the 22nd year of the Republic, the amount of debt raised totaled 549,591,413 yuan for domestic debt, accounting for 89.55%; and 64,000,000 yuan for foreign debt, accounting for 10.45%. Raising our debt, whether domestic or foreign, is not without its drawbacks from both an economic and political perspective. Therefore, it should not be attempted unless there is no other way to increase internal and external debt. Now that the amount of foreign debt being raised is gradually decreasing, the "dependency" of our nation's economy and politics is also gradually disappearing. Therefore, I believe this is a positive phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, borrowing is truly just a short-term fix, like "eating this year's harvest to cover next year's needs." To balance the national economy, expenditures must equal revenues, and issuing public debt is often unavoidable. Even when issuing domestic debt, the people's ability to bear the burden and the impact on the entire national economy must be considered. Otherwise, it could lead to a situation that harms the people and wastes resources. What is the reality in our country? Please see the table on the left: (Based on Wang Zongpei's "Inland Public Debt in the Past Month," Bank Weekly, Volume 20, Issue 3.) The unit for the issued amount is in millions of yuan, except where indicated as yuan.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy in the table is that no public debt was issued in the 21st year of the Republic. This was likely not due to a balanced budget, but rather because the public debt market had reached a point of saturation. Furthermore, looking at the accumulated balance at the end of each year, it increases rapidly every year except for the 6 million yuan decrease in the 21st year. In the 24th year, it increased by nearly 300 million yuan compared to the 23rd year. In today's era where everything needs to be rebuilt, we are not surprised by the expansion of public debt. However, debt must be repaid. According to the declaration issued by the bondholder association on February 1st, as of the end of January of this year, the government still owed a total of over 1.46 billion yuan in various domestic public bonds, treasury bills, certificates, etc., with a massive monthly payment of over 15 million yuan for principal and interest. Consequently, the proportion of debt service in national fiscal expenditure is increasing day by day. If the finances are tight, more public debt will be issued; if more public debt is issued, the financial difficulties will worsen. Isn't this a difficult situation for financial management?</p>
<p>(Note) The unit is in thousands of yuan. For years before the 22nd year of the Republic, the figures are based on the final accounts of the Ministry of Finance. For the 23rd and 24th years, they are based on the budgeted amounts.</p>
<p>With the increase in debt service on the expenditure side, it is inevitable that more new debt must be borrowed to facilitate turnover. According to the financial yearbook and the statistical materials released by the Ministry of Finance, the income from borrowing funds and the percentage of the total annual income are as shown in the table on the left.</p>
<p>(Note) The unit is in thousands of yuan. For years before the 22nd year of the Republic, the figures are based on the final accounts of the Ministry of Finance. For the 23rd and 24th years, they are based on the budgeted amounts.</p>
<p>By comparing the second and third tables, we can see that borrowing only increases financial difficulties. Debt accounts for more than 30% of expenditures, while income from borrowing only accounts for 20%. It is truly a case of not being worth the cost.</p>
<p>The expansion of public debt not only offers no benefits to finances, but its detrimental impact on industry and commerce is also very obvious. Although the face value interest rates on previously issued public debt were not high, they were often sold at a discount, resulting in actual interest rates as high as 1.2% or even higher. Speculators, attracted by the high interest rates, were actively involved in the securities market. Investors, also enticed by the doubled interest rates, disregarded other types of investments. Under these circumstances, a large amount of social capital flowed into the securities market, and industry and commerce felt a severe shortage of funds, leaving them unable to inject capital and leading to today's depressed state. Therefore, for the sake of consolidating finances and rescuing industry and commerce, it is necessary to reorganize the existing public debt system.</p>
<p>There are only two ways to reorganize: one is to contract public debt, and the other is to extend the repayment period and reduce interest rates. At a time when construction has just begun and foreign troubles are pressing, contracting public debt is difficult to achieve. Extending the repayment period and reducing interest rates was implemented once in the 21st year of the Republic, and it did not have a detrimental impact on securities credit. Implementing it again this time should not cause any major problems. Extending the repayment period will relatively reduce the government's debt service. However, from another perspective, it will affect the ability to issue debt in the future. Extending the repayment period is nothing more than shifting today's burden to tomorrow. Therefore, for the sake of planning ahead, we should strive to economize in the future as a basis for contracting public debt. If public debt is issued in the future, and is used for construction projects, then because the projects themselves can generate profits, there is no need to worry about repaying the principal and interest. If public debt is issued merely to make up for financial shortfalls, then repaying the principal and interest in the future may be more difficult. As for the issue of interest rate reduction, there is much debate. I believe that although reducing interest rates may temporarily cause some losses for bondholders, it is not only harmless but also beneficial to the entire national economy. Why is that? Lower interest rates lighten the government's debt burden, eliminating the need to increase taxes or issue more public debt to increase revenue. This is one aspect. Also, those who used to invest in securities because of the high interest rates will not be willing to do so in the future, so that capital can flow to the industrial sector. This is the second aspect. "A small lack of patience can ruin a great plan." Wise people will naturally know what to choose and what to discard, without the need for us to elaborate.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of guarantees for the repayment of principal and interest on public debt, the unified public debt issued this time still follows the original provisions of the existing bonds, allocating the remaining tax revenue from customs duties after deducting indemnity payments to foreign debt for payment. However, the principal and interest of the 340 million yuan of the Reconstruction Public Debt will have to wait until after the tax revenue from customs duties has been allocated to indemnity payments to foreign debt, the long-term financial public debt of the 17th year, and the unified public debt of the 25th year, with the remaining tax revenue as the fund. As for the annual principal and interest to be repaid, taking only the unified public debt as an example, excluding the one installment of principal and interest (July 31st) paid in the 25th year, the amount of principal and interest to be repaid every five years is listed below (in units of thousands of yuan).</p>
<p>(Note) The year of full repayment is the amount of a single principal and interest payment. The years with the most principal and interest repayment, when the repayment is completed in the 49th year, will reach more than 14.9 million yuan, with an average of always over 10 million yuan. The principal and interest of the Reconstruction Public Debt are not included. However, since its debt amount is comparable to the unified C debt (the unified C debt is 350 million yuan), the annual principal and interest repayment can also be compared to the figures for the unified C debt (see table 2), and the national customs duties are listed below. (Unit: yuan)</p>
<p>The speculative activity in our country's public debt is unmatched by other countries. Examining the reasons, it is likely due to the government's lax control. Regarding this point, refer to the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Speculation Control Act of 1934, and formulate the Chinese Securities Control Regulations in light of our nation's realities. I once introduced the two U.S. bills in issues 59 and 64 of this publication, in the articles "New Changes in American Securities Investment" and "New Progress in American Securities Control." The main methods are nothing more than cracking down on futures trading, strictly regulating the qualifications and scope of activities of brokers, increasing margin requirements, and regularly inspecting the books and other records of brokers and exchanges. If the above points can be applied properly, speculative activities can naturally be stopped, and legitimate investors will not be hindered at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Is There a Turnaround for the French Franc? <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yusheng</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In the global currency struggle, the French franc, which has been in an absolutely passive position, has recently shown signs of gradually stabilizing. On February 6th, the discount rate of the Bank of France was reduced from 5% to 2.5%. The reasons for this are: first, the French franc's exchange rate is strong. Over the past month, it has risen considerably in terms of the US dollar, and it has been very stable in terms of the British pound. Second, the movement of US cash into France, which has reached 14 million US dollars as of February 7th. Third, a large amount of domestic private reserves of hard currency have flowed back into the market due to the threat of devaluation, all of which have given France the opportunity to lower its discount rate. Therefore, it is believed that this move by France is sufficient to increase the confidence of domestic citizens and foreign speculators in French politics, dispel rumors of British loans, and indicate a turnaround for the French franc. Examining the facts and analyzing them, we know that all of this is just a kind of reaction of social psychology, and the French franc has its fundamental crisis.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The discount rate of the Bank of France has changed as many as six times in six months. The French financial community today is like a bird startled by the twang of a bow, and is most easily disturbed. If there is no solid foundation, then the current reduction in the discount rate will also be fleeting and will not help the overall situation. Once the above three reasons for the rate reduction are investigated, they are not enough to guarantee the current situation. Because the French franc is under pressure from the pound sterling, it is about to collapse. And Britain and the United States are afraid that its collapse will affect the safety of the pound sterling. Therefore, Britain and the United States have provided assistance in the past month. Britain has purchased gold in the London market to maintain the French franc, and is eager to stabilize the exchange rate between the British and French currencies at 75.06 French francs per pound sterling. The United States is shipping out gold and lowering the US dollar in order to raise the exchange rate of the French franc. All of this means that the French franc has achieved temporary stability under the control of the pound sterling, giving the French people a kind of psychological comfort. In fact, the amount of gold shipped into France by the United States last week was not as much as the amount shipped to London by France; in addition, although the amount of domestic currency flow has increased, it has not helped the international position of the French franc. Therefore, the foundation for the stability of the French franc this time is extremely fragile, and turning to consider its crisis, it is becoming more and more profound.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The fundamental crisis of the French franc lies in the fact that the pound sterling, with its exchange rate advantage, has broken the line of the gold standard group. This has caused France's foreign trade to decline rapidly. There is no room for competition abroad, and it is subject to dumping of foreign goods at home. The sharp decline in the total amount of trade over the years and the sharp increase in excess labor have both created a one-sided trend, causing domestic prices to fall, industry and commerce to decline, and capital to flee. On January 10 of this year, the reserve amount of the Bank of France was 66,267 million French francs, a decrease of 15,748 million French francs compared with the same period last year. Although the government has implemented a strict austerity policy to tide over the many difficulties, the result has made the economic situation even more depressed and the French franc's illness has become more and more profound. Therefore, when talking about the future of the French franc today, we must start from this point. The temporary import of gold and the reduction of interest rates are all trivial issues and are not enough to talk about a turnaround. If the French franc problem still needs to seek remedial measures, France really only has two ways to follow at this time: the immediate solution is to negotiate a loan from Britain; the fundamental solution is to improve the devaluation of the French franc by half. However, the French people have learned a historical lesson. After the war, it was once devalued and suffered great damage. There is a psychological fear of currency. All previous cabinets have taken maintaining the French franc as a prerequisite, and it is difficult to change the parity. However, today, times have changed, and the general trend is that we firmly believe that the French franc will be the initiator of the world's currency reset movement, and the time will not be too far away.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Discussion on Organizing Urban and Rural Banks <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xun</p>
<p>Recently, in the improvement of financial organizations, there has been discussion about setting up urban and rural banks. Regarding this point, we believe that attention should be paid. If the methods are appropriate and the facilities are appropriate, it can help the development of the rural economy and improve agricultural production and the livelihood of farmers. If the method is not appropriate, or if there is no consistent and comprehensive policy, it may only strengthen the oppression of agricultural capital by commercial capital, and even open the door for local tyrants and wealthy people to exploit farmers. Therefore, several points are originally proposed for discussion below, to help negotiate.</p>
<p>1.  Capital Issue</p>
<p>The urban and rural areas we are talking about refer to the inland areas far away from big cities. As for the areas near the big cities, banks are lined up and the financial organization is actually very complete. The organization of urban and rural banks is not important. Therefore, the urban and rural banks we are talking about have the meaning of belonging to remote inland areas. Only in these areas, where economic development is still in its infancy and the financial organization is not yet complete, does the organization of urban and rural banks make sense. In these areas, the organization of banks, the capital item, has become a special problem. As a result of the economic panic in recent years, in some inland cities, business is depressed, freight is stagnant, not only is there no accumulation of funds, but most of them are heavily in debt and unable to extricate themselves. Under this kind of environment, it is actually difficult to raise funds locally in some areas. Even if it can be barely collected, the amount is very small. It will not have any effect economically. Therefore, it is actually difficult to raise capital from local merchants and people. Secondly, it is even more difficult and dangerous for local government offices to allocate funds to open. First, the credit of local government offices is the worst in the eyes of merchants and people. Raising funds by local government offices will inevitably come from compulsory means. Second, financial institutions opened by local government offices often become a tool for raising funds in finance. In today's situation where local finances are generally insufficient, it is really dangerous. I am afraid that credit cannot be established and it will disrupt finance. As for issuing bank stocks and selling them in cities, absorbing the funds of big cities, it is even more difficult in today's underdeveloped bill market. It is even more difficult to establish it by the state. At present, the country does not have such great power and energy. So urban and rural banks. It seems simple, but in fact the capital problem. It is not easy to solve. Because it is not easy to solve, the problem of land securities has emerged recently. In fact, in addition to land, there is nothing else in rural areas. Therefore, to organize a bank in rural areas and collect capital on its own, there is no way other than to base it on land. Organizing a bank based on land has become another kind of nature, and we cannot dwell on it here. In short, the capital problem of the organization of urban and rural banks seems simple, but it is actually very difficult to solve. We cannot make any specific suggestions here, but we put forward several principles as follows:</p>
<p>First, the capital of urban and rural banks cannot be obtained by compulsory apportionment and borrowing by local government offices.</p>
<p>Second, the capital of urban and rural banks should be quite strong, and cannot be nominal.</p>
<p>Third, the capital of urban and rural banks cannot be monopolized by local wealthy people and become a private tool.</p>
<p>Fourth, the capital of urban and rural banks should be of an active nature, and cannot be used as illiquid land or real estate.</p>
<p>Fifth, the capital of urban and rural banks should avoid being directly supplied by local government offices as much as possible.</p>
<p>2.  Management Issues</p>
<p>Who manages the urban and rural banks, and who supervises them? This is also an important issue, which is closely related to the bank's credibility among the people. In theory, it is managed by the shareholders' meeting, operated by the board of directors, and supervised by the board of supervisors. This seems to be a common practice. However, since we oppose the urban and rural banks being controlled by a few financial groups, the shareholders will inevitably be dispersed. Moreover, in various places, the people are ignorant and the power of the government offices is great. The so-called urban and rural banks are actually easily manipulated by local bureaucrats and bullies, thus causing various evil dramas of embezzlement and damaging credibility. Therefore, the management problem of urban and rural banks is particularly worthy of study. In this regard, we suggest the following principles:</p>
<p>First, the directors of urban and rural banks should be purely commercial talents. They are absolutely prohibited from having relationships with government factories, and they are not allowed to engage in similar businesses.</p>
<p>Second, the content of the operation of urban and rural banks should be public and announced monthly, absolutely avoiding confidential actions. Urban and rural banks are local public banks, and the operation policy does not need to be secret.</p>
<p>Third, the board of directors, shareholders' meeting or board of supervisors should absolutely avoid direct relationships with local government offices. Except for being supervised by law, there is no relationship with local government offices.</p>
<p>Fourth, the business policy is directly supervised by the Ministry of Finance or the National Economic Commission. The business situation should also be reported to the Ministry of Finance and the National Economic Commission monthly.</p>
<p>The above points are to ensure that urban and rural banks are purely economic organizations and absolutely reject the intrusion of political or financial forces. The evil consequences of the unhealthy relationship between local finance and local banks have rich experience in our country. In the future, only by adopting a decisive policy can the safety of this kind of bank be guaranteed.</p>
<p>3.  Business Issues</p>
<p>What kind of business do urban and rural banks operate? This is the central topic of our discussion on the issue of urban and rural banks. If the establishment of urban and rural banks is only to sell public bonds for the central or local government, sell aviation lottery tickets, or even collect taxes and borrow money for the government, then we dare to assert that it will become a tool of exploitation, which will not only be of no benefit to rural areas, but will also accelerate its collapse. We do not hope to organize such urban and rural banks. In the past, China set up many banks for agriculture, industry, commerce, industry, and domestic goods, but the results were not true to their names, and everyone embarked on the road of public bond trading. In the end, no one cared about the industry. Everyone must have seen enough of this. Therefore, our urban and rural banks should change their faces and do things in a practical and realistic way. It is not allowed to do the trick of hanging sheep's heads and selling dog meat again. In this regard, we put forward the following principles:</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks should operate purely economic business, not sell public bonds, not sell lottery tickets, and not participate in any speculative business.</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks should be the bridge between urban funds and rural capital financing. It itself raises funds from national banks or general commercial banks and flows into rural areas, earnestly doing the work of returning funds to agriculture, and acting as an agent for urban banks to invest in rural areas.</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks should become the leaders of rural business activities. It follows the principles of economy and helps the development of the most economically favorable business in a certain area. It itself leads the countryside and implements a part of the national economic policy.</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks themselves are the backing of cooperative accounting. Its loans should be mainly for cooperative societies. Loans for improper purposes by local gentlemen and tyrants are the main target. Loans for improper purposes by local gentlemen and tyrants should be rejected in all cases. At the same time, it should use its power to help other financial institutions in rural areas. It should give substantial assistance to pawnshops and small money shops.</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks themselves should consolidate their credit and repel the intrusion of all evil forces, so as to become a general meeting of local funds, so as to change the trend of funds escaping into cities. For deposits and small savings, there should be specific guarantees, so that people have confidence in local financial institutions, and funds can stay within the local scope.</p>
<p>4.  Relationship with National Banks</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks should not have relationships with local silver and regional——provincial banks in various places. Based on our current situation, it is simply difficult to find a healthy bank in many provincial banks. Therefore, urban and rural banks should directly contact national banks. It itself is the agent for the country to direct rural financial activities. National banks can use it to implement low-interest policies and suppress usury in rural areas. National banks can expand credit to it and stimulate domestic prices to balance urban and rural prices. National banks can use his activities to change the direction of capital flow and realize the country's economic policies. Therefore, in our opinion, urban and rural banks should be directly controlled by national banks and become a branch of the national bank's capital operation.</p>
<p>5.  Organizational Unit Issues</p>
<p>Urban and rural banks should be organized according to the economic environment. The areas it includes should be based on economic units and should never be the same as political oppression. Because it is an economic organization, not a political institution. And special urban and rural banks can be organized due to the special economic environment of the place. Its form, its scope, its strength, can be changed according to the local economic situation, and there is no need to be consistent. The situation in various places is different, and it is absolutely impossible to force various places to adopt the same method. As for its capital strength, it should be determined according to the local economic development. The scope should not be too small. If the scope is too small, it is not enough for a money shop to operate, and there is no need to set up a bank. In short, regarding the unit issue of the establishment of a face-to-face rural bank, we believe that the following principles should be followed.</p>
<p>The urban and rural areas should be based on the economic environment and do not need to be in line with the political scope. Seeking an economic unit that is self-contained and active, regardless of others.</p>
<p>The so-called urban and rural areas should not be too small. If the scope is too small, the bank's strength will be weak and it will feel powerless.</p>
<p>Regarding organization, it can be changed according to the special economic environment of the place, and there is no need to adhere to the same form throughout the country.</p>
<p>6.  Guarantee Issues</p>
<p>One of the most difficult points in running local financial undertakings is the destruction of local politics. The ravages of warlords and the extortion of local financial authorities are the main reasons for the bankruptcy of inland finance. Now we want to organize urban and rural banks. To hope that he fulfills his mission, we must first discuss the issue of guarantees. The state should issue a clear order to strictly prohibit local financial authorities from having relationships with such banks. These banks should strictly determine that they are supra-political organizations. No government agency can force it to accept debt certificates or borrow money from it. All losses caused by political issues, debt certificates cannot be forced to borrow money from it. The state should be directly responsible for losses caused by political issues. Banking operations are based on credit. If credit is damaged, all activities cannot proceed. Therefore, guaranteeing bank credit is a prerequisite for the healthy development of this system. And the proper way to guarantee is to isolate this kind of bank from the relationship with local finance. Most of the suggestions we made earlier are for this purpose.</p>

<p>Restore new transactions and cancel the submission of existing products.</p>
<p>The Huashang Securities Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday, ordering it to open as usual on the 17th. It still only does February futures, and the original bonds are only allowed to settle and are not allowed to make new transactions. The submission of existing products has not been cancelled. For this reason, the exchange brokers convened another general meeting at 2 pm yesterday. The brokers unanimously believed that new transactions were not allowed, and the short sellers had already submitted existing products, relying on nothing and being fearless. If the long sellers sell out, no one will accept them, and the market price may cause drastic changes again. Therefore, representatives were elected to join the exchange authorities to petition the Minister, requesting the restoration of new transactions, and also requesting the temporary cancellation of the submission of existing products. On the one hand, they requested the Ministry of Finance to balance the market price to avoid major changes. It seems that today's opening is actually difficult to achieve.</p>

Market prices for white japonica Gao Ke rice were weak by three to five fen, and medium and inferior grades were weak by a small jiao. Yang Du and Bu Ke rice were extremely weak, thin rice prices were down a small jiao, and Bian Yuan rice saw little change. The current sales prices for each household are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Oil Market: The Excellence of Using Tung Oil in Soap Making <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>—Strong Detergency Unmatched by Others—</p>
<p>Domestic tung oil has always been a raw material for candles and soap. Since the dumping of hardened oil from the East, its outlets have sharply decreased. However, factories like Guben still use non-tung oil, so the soap they produce has strong detergency and is welcomed everywhere, unlike those with a bright exterior. According to sources in the industry, last year's cypress seed harvest was particularly good. In areas such as Jiaxing, Jinhua, Lanxi, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Jingzhou, Jinshi, and Macheng, the inventory of oil presses and hoarders is estimated to be around 50,000 dan. According to Han Xun's report, the Macheng market price is 15 yuan per city catty. Therefore, recent arrivals in the city have been particularly numerous. Although scavenging sales have gradually become stagnant, factory appetites are particularly strong. Yesterday's opening price for Jiangxi goods was 20 yuan and 6 jiao, and the price after weighing at the factory ranged from 20 yuan and 5 jiao to 21 yuan and 2-3 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with poor news from Liverpool. Foreign firms and southerners sold off, and there was an increase in hedging. Prices for all months fell by three to ten points. Jones, the director of the Cotton Stabilization Corporation, stated that the corporation does not need to take delivery, but if the market price falls below the spot price, delivery will be suspended. Therefore, the March futures market price is entirely based on the spot price. Unfortunately, government bulls are gradually closing out positions in March, disrupting public confidence. At the close, the public's selling trend weakened. Spot prices fell by ten points, and futures prices fell by nine to thirteen points. British cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures prices fell by three points. The Indian cotton market was flat, and prices were weak due to selling by spot traders and futures traders. Pingguoer fell by 2.5 to 3.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.75 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 15th):</p>

<p>Silver Dollars Traded on the Black Market at 12 Jiao and 0.5 Li</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market was still very stable. Overnight interest rates remained unchanged, at seven fen in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. Transactions for overnight bills amounted to over 2.4 million in the morning, with new transactions exceeding 400,000. Afternoon transactions exceeded 200,000. Money shops received over 34 million in Yang Gong Dan clearing bills and over 400,000 in remittances from various routes. In the small coin market, morning transactions involved 4,000 jiao of Jiangnan small silver coins and 85,000 jiao of Guangdong small silver coins. Afternoon transactions involved 2,000 jiao of Jiangnan small silver coins and 20,000 jiao of Guangdong silver coins. The black market rate was slightly higher than the previous day, at 12 jiao and 0.5 li. There were no transactions for 28,500 strings of copper coins and 9,500 yuan of legal tender.</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>If a person does not have adequate reserves and preparation in terms of ability, they will certainly encounter failure in the battles of life.</p>
<p>Young people are strong in character and have no fear of shrinking back. Therefore, their emotions are easily impulsive and their courage is great. They can bravely move forward, disregard everything to implement their ideas, and spare no sacrifice. Middle-aged people gradually become more worldly-wise and their youthful spirit diminishes. However, they are rich in the ability to observe and judge matters. Reason and emotion are both highly developed. Therefore, if these two can be properly harmonized, what a great force that would be!</p>
<p>In the youthful stage of life, what we need is the accumulation of intelligence, physical strength, and critical ability. Because if you don't put something in at this time, then you will not be able to get anything out of your life in the future. This is just like how we cannot withdraw money from the bank if we have not deposited money into it.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Old General Ding Huai <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Old General Ding Huai, who defeated the French army at Liangshan, lived during the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty (the Sino-French War). It has been nearly fifty-two years since then, and few know his name. Previously, I saw reports that the National Government had issued an order to "commend and comfort" him. I understand that he passed away in Ping on the afternoon of June 24th last year, at the age of ninety-seven. The old general, who bore a generation of heroic name, should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>Looking back at the time when the French army attacked Liangshan, Liu Yongfu, a former general of the Taiping Army, had just been recruited by the Qing court and given the title of governor. Liu recovered the three provinces of Xuanguang, Xinghua, and Shanxi in Vietnam. Before long, Liangshan was disturbed, and Su Yuanchun, Pan Dingxin, and others fought hard but could not defend it. Fortunately, Ding was present and achieved the victory at Xiaonanguan. People only heard of the brave and selfless efforts of the generals Feng Zicai and others, but they did not know that Ding was also instrumental in repelling the enemy for over two hundred li in eight days and nights.</p>
<p>Ding was from Heqing County in western Yunnan. When Du Wenxiu's rebellion broke out, Cen Yuying, the governor of Yunnan, recruited soldiers to quell it. Ding was still young and plagued by hunger and cold, so he joined Cen's command. Cen considered him useful and soon appointed him as the general in charge of Tengyue, and later as the commander of Guizhou. Eventually, he was promoted to commander-in-chief of Jiangnan, but was later impeached by censors and left his post to live in seclusion. During his time in retirement, he spun yarn and wove cloth somewhere, but stopped due to financial losses. When Li Jingxi arrived in Yunnan, Ding was able to serve as an assistant in the local militia. Later, due to an increase in salt prices, he was dissatisfied with public opinion and was squeezed out. Later, when Cen Chunxuan was in Guizhou, he was recommended as the Zhen General of Zuojiang. Before long, he was promoted to brigadier general and concurrently served as the director of Longzhou. Until one year before the founding of the Republic of China, he was again dismissed from his post due to a case and sank into Hubei Province. Since then, his name was no longer heard in the officialdom.</p>
<p>In Hubei, he was known to Military Governor Chen Huilong, who ordered the Jianghan Customs to investigate a certain matter. Ding was greatly embarrassed, but was spared with the help of someone. When the Wuhan Uprising broke out, he had no choice but to lead his family to float down the river and take refuge in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, in May of the first year of the Republic of China, his enemies secretly broke into his room in the middle of the night near Jing'an Temple, killed his son and daughter-in-law, and were still not satisfied, and set fire to his house. Ding then moved north and lived a wandering life for over twenty years. Now, I hear of his passing, and the old general, who lived to be a hundred years old, has his merits recorded and passed down in the canon. Ding is still glorified.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Talking About Zhongming Hooks <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Those who keep birds must beautify their cages, and even the smallest hook must be crafted with extreme ingenuity. The so-called Zhongming Hook is indeed famous and precious. Zhongming's surname is Xu, and he is from Hubei Province. He originally practiced the craft of engraved knives, but later came to Shanghai and changed his profession to carving purple copper cage hooks. The fineness of his carvings is unmatched in the world. Those who see them cannot help but suspect that they are the work of ghosts and gods. The carvings include both words and paintings, and the inscriptions are complete, further distinguishing between civil and military themes. For example, a Zheyant furong (zebra finch) is a civil bird, and its cage has a civil hook. The carvings on the civil hook are nothing more than scenes from "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Dream of the Red Chamber." As for birds that are good at fighting, such as the yellow-headed bird, the hooks are carved with military events from the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," never mixed up. The value of a hook was originally set at thirty-six gold, but Zhongming loves alcohol and spends his days drunk, rarely working. Before the carving is even half finished, it is already pawned. The bird owner eagerly wants to get the hook back and redeems it for him. However, it is pawned again and then redeemed again. By the time the work is completed and in hand, it has often cost around a hundred gold. Therefore, if someone on the market today parts with a Zhongming Hook, the price is also no less than a hundred gold, or even over two hundred gold. Zhongming is still alive today, but due to excessive eye strain, he can no longer see things clearly. Someone saw him in Yu Garden and said that he is an old man with a red nose, hunched over and decrepit. It is said that his son-in-law can continue his work. The son-in-law originally specialized in carving fine patterns on the mouthpieces of dry tobacco pipes in a pipe shop. Zhongming saw that his skills were promising, so he married his daughter to him. And after being instructed, the carving of hooks is also quite impressive, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Gleanings from the Nanshe Memorial Meeting <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Shengwu</p>
<p>On the evening of the former New Year's Day, I attended a dinner party for the Nanshe Memorial Meeting at the Tongyu Restaurant. Many of the attendees were writers and historians, and their accounts were full of fascinating anecdotes. Seeing this, I couldn't help but feel itchy, so I gleaned some observations to serve as a supplement to Spring and Autumn. On that day, during Mr. Liu Yazi's speech, the atmosphere in the entire venue was tense, and applause was incessant. When he reported that Mr. Cai Yuanpei had been publicly elected as honorary president, the crowd clapped even more enthusiastically. Finally, they shouted "Long live the Nanshe Memorial Meeting!" More than 150 attendees stood up and drank a large glass each. At this time, snow was falling heavily outside the window, and the ground was covered in a silver world, which was a wonderful embellishment to this grand event.</p>
<p>Someone asked Lin Gengbai to talk about his love history, and he could not refuse, so he stood up and said, "I have never been in love, so how can there be a history?" This sentence was like a breaking of the ice in an old essay, simple and direct. The friends in the audience responded with "You are too polite, you are too polite." Seeing that the momentum was not right, he immediately shifted his target and continued, "Everyone should know that this year is Mr. Liu's 50th birthday. Today, we will use flowers to offer to Buddha, and everyone will drink a toast to Mr. Liu to wish him a happy birthday." Sure enough, everyone was coaxed by him to stand up and drink a cup, but he left the stage like that.</p>
<p>Among the female guests, Ms. Lu Lihua was the most eloquent. In two jokes, several "Gai! Gai!" (covers) caused the audience to burst into laughter. Then, Mr. Zeng Xubai came out and said that he was from Changshu and should say a few words, because one of Ms. Lu's jokes was told in the Changshu dialect. Mr. Zeng stood up and said, "Yes, right!" The whole audience burst into laughter again, saying that it was "certified" as an "ancient edition."</p>
<p>Most of the people who attended that day were strong men from the southeast, but there were also some distinguished guests from the north. Among them was the elderly Mr. Yan Ganyuan, who spoke about the situation in the northwest. We listened to the old man's gentle cough, and it was as if we were in the middle of a vast grassland with withered grass and running cattle and horses, listening to the anecdotes of the Han Palace. Sitting with Guan Lao was an old man named Wu Banshan, who was from Hangzhou and was formerly known as Mu Shi Jushi. He and his wife, Lady Fengyun, compiled and printed "Lyrics of Famous Women of Past Dynasties." I saw his inscription, and I have excerpted a poem as follows: "Each of the group heroes turned into something new, and people of their own color are self-reliant. After listening to the duo singing under the flowers, Li Zhu Duanhe is worthy of matching Su Xin." The old man is also very fond of good deeds. The current sage, Mr. Ye Chuyi, is his fast son-in-law, it is said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Pu'an's lofty ambitions have not diminished slightly. The "What to Do Song" that he distributed at the meeting showed his tragic and generous intentions. He explained in his own words: "In the past, Gui Xuan Gong wrote the 'Eternal Sorrow Song', and since Pangu, everyone is a person who can be scolded, and everything is something that can be scolded. This is the so-called day of helplessness. As far as I know, the changes in the world are becoming more and more urgent, and those that can be scolded have all been scolded by Xuan Gong; Xuan Gong has never encountered the opportunity to scold them. Although Xuan Gong is in a day of helplessness, there are still things that can be helped; today is truly the helplessness of helplessness...". As for the lyrics, Mr. Liu Yazi has two absolute sentences, "Gifted in the same seat", as follows: "The country has fallen into the hands of dwarfs, and the altar still seeks the old alliance. Enduring tears and pretending to be happy, my business is over, how can I support my eyes and wait for the river to clear. Wine dragon and poem tiger thirty years ago, the sword heart and Xiao Xin have not turned into smoke. If you make a bold statement in Xinting, I, Yi Wu Jiangzuo, am still virtuous." The implicit words show a strong excitement, worthy of being the leader of the literati. Those who want to know about Liu's life and his recent feelings can see it in this.</p>
<p>Also, that night, I sat with a friend at the Dahua Ballroom and made another piece. Gifted to Mr. Song Huanggong: "Old heroes are full of sorrow, and it is difficult to tame the dragon's nature, still arrogant. The dream of Jin Ge Iron Horse Liaoyang, how can I leave the tenderness to old age in this hometown?" A poem given to Mr. Ren Weizhi: "Thirty-five years into a glimpse, holding the intestines with a mango corner drunk face red, European knife mellow wine blood of the battlefield, what can we do after we die?" After the dance, Ji Yun: "Into the arms of the weaving waist ironing electric waves, Yu Yan Wei halo tired Jiaoe, stroking the ring body is a casual thing, I do not believe that the return of the intestines is a lot of spirit." Thinking of a foreign friend, "Turning green and returning yellow with thousands of tears, it is difficult for the beautiful woman to check the period. The northern Hunan is very common, and the sorrowful He Liang Su Li poem." Passion bursts out, Qingli can be read.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Huaichen also wrote two poems on the spot as follows: "Try the Qiong Yan in the spring lantern shadow, Bai Ye can also be at the rice also Dian. The pattern of several restorations survives other factions, and the characters of Yonghe are prepared by the group. The things in the eyes become traces, and the heroic feelings on the seat are like in the past. Who cares about the new wine in the old bottle, only laziness is good and does not need to be transmitted. (The last sentence borrows Shi Nai'an's words, and slightly changes a word.) Simple and thick, the poem is like its person. His original intention was only to be lazy and not to be transmitted, I am now making it public for him, please don't blame him.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Striding around the room, delivering a grand talk to encourage a lawsuit; pouring out the jug, reminiscing about old friendships to forget suspicions</p>
<p>He didn't sit down; instead, standing, he raised his wine cup and said, "I'll drink it all in one gulp, leaving not a drop. Please watch me." Having said that, he raised the wine in the cup to his mouth and swallowed it with a resounding whoosh. Then, he turned over the inside of the forest, facing it outwards for comparison. Wang Shicheng also had no way to refuse and stood up to drink his cup dry as well. Jia Duocai bent over, put down his cup, and nodded repeatedly to the two men, saying, "Thank you, thank you. Just based on you two so readily giving me face, I will definitely tell the landlord to make many concessions on the land price." Having said this, he sat down, just as the waiter delivered the dishes, and he repeatedly offered food to the two Wangs. Bei Hai was constantly expressing his gratitude, feeling that he wasn't exactly an easy person to talk to. He was truly surprised that he was putting in so much effort to arrange things today. He still needed to be extra cautious in his words, and thus, he began to pay attention to him. Whenever Jia Duocai asked a question, he never gave a definite answer. When Jia Duocai had drunk about half his wine, he smiled at Bei Hai and said, "Does Mr. Wang know that Miss Zhu Yueying?" This sentence came out of Jia Duocai's mouth lightly, but Bei Hai's face turned red, and he was so frightened that his heart was pounding wildly.</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Weighing profit over beauty, the gunner relinquishes his love; high ambitions and healthy feet, the strong man ventures into the wilderness</p>
<p>Wang Beihai's feelings for Zhu Yueying were just a moment of pity; it couldn't be said to be love. As that moment of pity gradually deepened, he slowly added a little bit of concern. Beihai certainly didn't want anyone to know about this situation, and he didn't expect anyone to know. Now that Jia Duocai himself brought up Yueying, it seemed like Duocai already knew everything that he had done, which made him not know what to say. His face turned red, and he answered unclearly, "That...that...ah! I don't know her. However, there's a Mr. Cheng who's with her...it's not exactly that I know her; we just live in the same hotel, so I recognize her." Jia Duocai laughed and said, "It doesn't matter. Nowadays, social interaction between men and women is open. It's fine to make friends. What's so important about it?" Beihai lowered his head in embarrassment, raised his cup to take a sip, and then said in a low voice with a smile, "I didn't expect Mr. Jia to be so open-minded." Duocai laughed and said, "It's nothing. Within Tongguan, people might think this kind of situation is a bit strange. But in Shanghai, a woman doesn't even need to completely sever her marital relationship with her ex-husband to cohabitate with a man. And another man can openly go in and out with that woman without avoiding people." (403)</p>

<p>There is a key to dealing with matters: that is, you need to be silent and free. If you are unable to avoid being frantic and at a loss, Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong once said, "In order to be a human and do things, you must be able to be still in motion, and to be free in busyness, in order to have insight into things and be beneficial to yourself. This is not easy, but as long as you can endure, you will naturally see busyness as leisure and motion as stillness." This so-called "endurance" undoubtedly requires a kind of learning to cultivate a calm mind and a quiet heart in order to reach the point of "being able to endure."</p>

<p>— Shen Chu</p>
<p>"To talk about tigers is to change color," the tiger is such a ferocious thing. You listen to the pronunciation of tiger cubs, the shape of the tiger character, heroic and vigorous, is indeed a hero. Adding it to anyone's head will not lose its power. Tiger squats, tiger looks, tiger generals, etc., are all imposing and unrepeatable. However, unexpectedly, "Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital" records: "The Han Dynasty used jade as a tiger cub, as a urinal, and made the waiter hold it to follow the lucky ones." To make a dignified tiger general, succumb to the name of a urinal, is really a fall!</p>

<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Rich beggars are a common occurrence in the Jianghuai region. Jianghuai people have a superstition that if parents die at the age of eighty-one, the children and grandchildren must beg for food. In this case, the children and grandchildren should follow the trend and beg from a hundred families? This will exempt them from begging in the future. This is a truly ridiculous superstition. The other day, a wealthy family staged this kind of farce because their mother died. A family of six or seven people, wearing torn clothes, carrying baskets, and queuing up on the road to beg. They are used to living in a shifted atmosphere and nourished body. Once they make a fool of themselves, the expressions on their faces are extremely embarrassing. In fact, the death of parents has nothing to do with the poverty of their children and grandchildren. The foolish people disturb themselves, and the level of superstition of the Jianghuai people is indeed self-inflicted shame.</p>

<p>— Chen Yijin</p>
<p>There have already been two entries in this publication on the abbreviation of national currency. In the reporter's opinion, the national currency should be written as 法幣 (Fa Bi). Why? Because the government issues 法幣 (Fa Bi).</p>
<p>In our business community, abbreviations have become a habit, but the two characters "法幣 (Fa Bi)" have a lot of strokes, and many people feel that writing them is inconvenient. Therefore, I propose to use the character "沛 (Pei)" to represent "法幣 (Fa Bi)." First, writing it can be convenient, and second, it does not interfere with the character "洋 (Yang)."</p>

<p>Selections from the New Youth Essay Contest</p>
<p>This company once solicited articles with the following two topics in the second issue of the "Reading Club": (1) Reading the inaugural issue of "New Youth", (2) What I hope for "New Youth", please express your great opinions so that it can be the south needle for future editing. As of the 10th of this month, fourteen articles were received. The contents of each article are mostly praises for "New Youth" and few corrections, which makes colleagues feel endlessly ashamed. Here are five articles selected and compiled into a special issue in the "Reading Club" of the fourth issue. Due to space constraints, the remaining articles could not be published one by one; in addition to sending them by separate letter, I also express my joy! Sincerely, New Youth Society</p>

<p>— Qingfen</p>
<p>Starting from My Childhood: The Development of Children's Literature</p>
<p>If we just speed up a bit, everyone has had a period of devouring news reporter novels, forgetting to eat and sleep. As for the content of the novels, and how much good or harm they would bring us, we had no time to consider, mostly because we lacked the ability to think about those things. For me, this period was from the ages of fourteen to seventeen, from the fourth grade of elementary school to the third grade of senior elementary school. I boarded at a county elementary school surrounded by rural areas, and the thirty or so classmates who boarded there were also young people obsessed with novels. The school absolutely forbade reading novels, but we were relatively enlightened, knowing that simply prohibiting it was useless; so, they specifically designated several kinds such as "Romance of the States" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," allowing us to read them in our spare time. The meaning was that, except for these designated kinds, reading was prohibited. But who cared? As long as one classmate brought a novel from home, it would immediately spread to the whole group in a secretive manner. Depending on the closeness of the relationship with the owner, it would be passed around. Often, the person reading the second book would be urged by the person reading the first, and the person reading the second would urge the person reading the third. Thinking about that silly energy now is quite amusing. What we worried about most was being searched and having them confiscated; at the same time, we enjoyed the satisfaction and happiness of "I've read it too" again and again—although this satisfaction and happiness, looking at it now, seems so pitiful.</p>
<p>Later, I myself stood lecturing students. Fortunately, the situation there had changed greatly. Vernacular Chinese had replaced the position of classical Chinese, and students were not only not prohibited from reading novels, but were also guided to do so. Many famous old novels replaced the position of "classics" and "commentaries" and were introduced to the desks of young people. For things that should not be read, there was also an active explanation of the reasons why they "should not" be read, no longer an arbitrary prohibition. At the same time, foreign fairy tales and stories were being introduced one after another. Mu Mutian's translation of "The Happy Prince and Other Tales" by Oscar Wilde, and Zhao Kangren's translation of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" were published one after another. The names of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm gradually became familiar to young people. China's inherent folk tales and legends also began to be collected and organized. Lin Lan's compilation of "The Stories of Xu Wenchang" and others were published one after another. On the one hand, Mr. Ye Shaojun's creative fairy tales—later collected in the two collections "The Scarecrow" and "The Stone Statue of the Ancient Hero"—were also published in the "Children's World" one after another. Following this, various bookstores published books written for young people to read. Almost all the works of Hans Christian Andersen, the king of fairy tales, were translated. Carlo Collodi's "The Adventures of Pinocchio," Edmondo De Amicis's "Heart" (Cuore)... Almost all the famous works that young people around the world should read and love to read, the young people of our China have the fortune to read.</p>
<p>However, our country is a world-renowned ancient country. The characteristics of ancient countries are the long history of culture and the unusually large number of superstitious and bizarre legends and stories. Young people, having the opportunity to read freely, swallowed many useful things as expected, but many superstitious and bizarre stories of gods and martial arts novels were also loved by them. At the same time, the newly emerging film industry specialized in catering to the low tastes of superstitious and bizarre old people, using absurd stories of immortal swordsmen like "The Adventures of a Beggar Soilder" to construct many films like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," one after another. We all know that the suggestive power and educational effect of movies on human life—especially the pure-hearted, very weak-willed young people—is absolutely true. After reading those novels and then using these movies to confirm them, the impact on young people is far beyond the reach of school education. And the perilous international situation, the precarious state of the country, young people see a little news from the school's wall newspaper, and hear a little alarming words from adults; they can't wait for that day: to succeed in forging a sword, return after attaining enlightenment, and with just a few simple strokes, transform this world of only power and no justice into a dreamlike fairyland.</p>
<p>As a result, many unfortunate things happened. Three fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boys from the same elementary school in Changsha disappeared. They took some money from home and left a water buffalo, saying they were going to Mount Emei in Sichuan to learn from a master. After the parents' panic and chaos, they finally found these three treasures at the wharf in Hankou on a ship to Sichuan. At the same time, similar things happened in Wuchang and Guangzhou, which were greatly recorded in the newspapers. I had a sixteen-year-old apprentice who was learning business in a shop; he usually liked to read novels very much, and since the year before last, he had abstained from meat and practiced vegetarianism. Last year, on the first day of the lunar new year, his colleagues in the shop took advantage of the holiday to go out and play, but he braved the sun, snow, and cold rain to go to the Guanyin Temple on Xianglu Peak, more than ten miles outside the city, to burn incense. Judging by his actions, he was already on the path of cultivation.</p>
<p>Because of these possessed-like facts, they once aroused the worries of the education authorities and the loud calls of educators, who launched a movement to clean up and disinfect children's books. It has always been the failure of adults to guide, the neglect of parents to pay attention, and the courage of social education institutions to be derelict in their duties that, after being stimulated by these facts, gave them the opportunity to reflect. After the efforts of all parties, the children were finally rescued from the poisonous atmosphere and demonic path. This was only two or three years ago. Therefore, children's books, since their free development, have also gone through such a dark period.</p>
<p>There has always been an unforgivable mistake in the concept of children's books. It is believed that the entire image of children's books belongs to literature: therefore, the topics depicted are literary, and the writing task is for literary artists. Leading children's books far away from life, as if children should always live in a non-realistic poetic world; instead, the actual phenomena and common sense of life that surround them every day are neglected completely. As a result, in addition to cultivating children into dream seekers who avoid reality, there is no attempt to understand life and improve life.</p>
<p>It is only recently that social sciences that explain the meaning of life and natural sciences that explore the phenomena of life have been appropriately woven together, interestingly depicted, and originally written into special books for young people to read. The kindness of the person who first attempted this kind of work to the young people of the whole world, I think, should not be below the person who invented the term "education." Unfortunately, in this old country where everything is backward, it is still not easy to find such fresh children's books.</p>
<p>Recently, the "New Youth" published by Kaiming Bookstore, judging by its main purpose, is to teach young people to "understand society, appreciate literature, and understand nature." It is attempting to introduce social sciences and natural sciences to young readers with the same importance as literature. Reading its inaugural issue, it is indeed doing so in these three aspects. This made me recall the pitiful state of my own childhood, and envy the young people living today. Although our childhood has passed, there are still our younger siblings and children. We should all recall the pitiful state of our own childhood, and what we could not receive should be compensated for by our younger siblings and children. This is how humanity has progressed. We don't need to grieve for our past selves.</p>
<p>I am now so grateful that I am about to shed tears, and I no longer have the time to write down the advantages of "New Youth" and what other hopes I have. Let others say it.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Reading "New Youth" Inaugural Issue, Part 1 <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Tianxiu</p>
<p>I recently bought the inaugural issue of "New Youth" at the Kaiming Bookstore. Perhaps it has a certain power to attract people. I maintained a strong interest throughout and finished reading it in one breath.</p>
<p>I dare not arbitrarily determine that all the youth publications in the country cannot catch up with the "New Youth," but at least I must say that it should be the most outstanding youth publication in the country in recent times. Among a large number of poorly made children's books, it appears particularly vibrant.</p>
<p>Empty compliments or condemnations are enough to obscure the facts and cause the value of the original intention to lose fair estimation. Therefore, the following should quickly speak truthfully based on the inaugural issue of "New Youth" itself.</p>
<p>The balanced allocation of quality and quantity is an obvious advantage that should be emphasized. In the "Editor's Note" of the inaugural issue, there are these few sentences: "...The mission of this magazine is to teach young people (1) to understand society (2) to appreciate literature (3) to understand nature..." I think, those who generally have educational responsibility for young people may not have any objections to these three points or favor one over the other, right? And what is gratifying is that the editors can use these three points as editing guidelines. Analyzing the works in the inaugural issue, in terms of social sciences, there are four articles such as "Youth Reading Room" and "The Yellow River Waters Come From the Sky"; in terms of natural sciences, there are twelve articles such as "The Words of the Moon," "The Secret of Seeing," and "Scientific News"; in terms of literature, there are six articles such as "Bird Language and Animal Speech" and "Young Printer." Although the number of articles in each category is not similar, the allocation is very balanced in terms of the length of each category. This proves that the editors do not favor a certain category. They see the "vitamins" needed by modern young people spiritually, and combine them in appropriate amounts to make this delicious and nutritious "spiritual food" and send it to young people. This is the success of the inaugural issue of "New Youth."</p>
<p>Secondly, the appropriateness of writing techniques is also an advantage of this magazine. Anyone with writing experience probably understands that writing a work for young people or children to read is not as easy as most people imagine; because it must also have psychological basis, or actual observation and experience of young people's lives, and even the selection of each word and phrase, and the combination of sentences, must all adapt to their imagination, comprehension, and center of interest. In the inaugural issue, like Ye Shengtao's "Bird Language and Animal Speech" and Feng Zikai's "The Adventures of a Small Banknote," these two fairy tales are very skillful in the creative techniques of children's literature. People are willing to read them attentively and put their innocent little hearts into the works, developing feelings with the characters in the works. Mao Dun's "Young Printer" is a long serialized novel, and only the beginning has been seen now, so it is not easy to talk about it. Ye Shengtao is not only a writer who has long enjoyed a reputation in the literary world, but I imagine he must also be an excellent composition teacher in school. His "Wen Xin" has long been welcomed by most junior high school students. In this inaugural issue, he wrote an "Article Exhibition," presenting Zhu Ziqing's essay, titled "Background," and he attached a guiding passage of more than two thousand words after the article. I believe that this kind of sincere and unwearying explanation and instruction will not bore a young person who loves literature. This kind of emphasis on the essential nature of literature and intimate guidance is necessary for young people who are just understanding literature. Works on natural and social sciences should emphasize reasoning a little bit, but it is best to avoid preaching and lecturing writing methods. Most of the works on natural and social sciences in the inaugural issue can be said to be easy and light, and contain a bit of fun. Moreover, the editors are very good at using current events and things that are close to young people's lives as research topics. The topics taken from current events include Ding Xiaoxian's "The Yellow River Waters Come From the Sky," which explains the roots of the Yellow River disaster and the fundamental methods of treatment; Song Yi's "The Words of the Moon," which uses the style of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Words of the Moon" to explain the news published in the newspaper that there will be two lunar eclipses this year and that British astronomer Jeans predicted that the moon would split. This kind of common sense topic can very well adapt to the curiosity of young people.</p>
<p>Deficiencies are not absent, but there are not many and they do not cause significant damage. For example, the historical story "The Song of the Striking," in the inaugural issue, although it is not very bad, and it contains a hidden power to inspire temperament, it is best to understand the social background at that time before appreciating historical stories, so that it is easy to deeply appreciate them. It is a question whether most young people have relatively sufficient knowledge of history and geography; of course, how much influence historical stories have on young people is also a question. If these pages could be used to publish a short story that is close to the real life of young people, it might be more eye-catching. The paper seems a bit too thin. It would be best to use the opposite cover to select and print some paintings or photographs worthy of sinking, I think these should also be loved by young readers, right?</p>
<p>"We want to develop comfortably, grasp the glorious future! We want to move forward smoothly, returning to that vast ocean!" This is a line from the opening song in the inaugural issue of "New Youth." I also hope for this vibrant youth publication.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Tianxiu mentioned historical stories, and we seem to have a few words to say.</p>
<p>The purpose of publishing this type of historical story (or historical sketch) in "New Youth" is threefold: First, to write the rigid historical story a little more active, hoping to arouse young people's interest in reading history books; to put it exaggeratedly, hoping to arouse young people's interest in studying history. Second, hoping that young people can avoid getting a little historical knowledge outside of the "textbooks." Third, hoping that young people can understand the social background at that time from this type of historical story.</p>
<p>Speaking of the third point, our views are exactly the opposite of Mr. Wang's: Mr. Wang believes that "one must first understand the social background at that time before it is easy to deeply appreciate it," and we believe that one must understand the social background at that time from this type of historical story.</p>
<p>We believe that if a historical story is written in a way that does not allow young people to deeply appreciate it, it is a failure in the selection of materials or techniques, not because history is not close to real life, which reduces its "influence on young people."</p>
<p>We thank Mr. Wang for his enthusiastic guidance and criticism, and at the same time, we are willing to listen to the opinions of other readers.</p>
<p>New Youth Magazine</p>
<h3 id="e169">Part 2 <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Qingshui</p>
<p>"Children's Year" has slipped past for a few months, quietly and silently, and no one is seen shouting anymore. Just for the "spiritual food" for children, good newspapers and good publications have been silent for a few months, without any interest at all. Only knowing how to "shout" but not knowing how to "do," such a "Children's Year," not to mention that the time is one year, even if it is extended to ten years, it will be useless. Can it provide salvation to the poor children who are in a bad environment, receiving a bad education, and are lost in the maze of bad publications? No, not at all. However, in the midst of these few months of boredom and disappointment, we were happy to read the "New Youth" semi-monthly magazine published by Kaiming Bookstore on January 10th. This is a general publication for children and elementary school students to read. The size is similar to the previous "Youth" (monthly) published by the Commercial Press, but the content has greatly improved; compared with the children's magazines sold in the market at the same time, it is equally easy for children to read and is also the most beneficial publication for the "physical and mental cultivation" and "academic cultivation" of children. Although I have passed my childhood, when it came into my hands, I felt the richness of the content and the clarity of the text, and I read it in one breath. It is rare to see such a good children's publication—at least that's how I feel personally.</p>
<p>Let's count the contents of the "inaugural issue." Youth Reading Room, fairy tales, scientific features and experiments, astronomical stories, art stories, article exhibitions, scientific world... these texts are all what every child or young person should read. Each text is written with the psychology and mood of a child or young person, so it is wonderfully clear, guiding, lively, and easy to read. Not only fairy tales, but also news and science are easy to understand, with no obscurity or dryness. It is impossible to obtain such a publication that seems to be written by children themselves ten years ago—even five years ago. When we read Hendrik Willem van Loon's "The Story of Mankind" in the past, we hated that we could not find a popular and interesting science book to read in China, and we almost wanted to change our nationality and become a foreigner. Now, after reading "New Youth," I hate that I was born too early and could not enjoy such a nutritious and easy-to-swallow and easy-to-digest publication in the golden age of childhood.</p>
<p>To put it more practically, most of the texts in here are written by famous experts and scholars, so it is of course good. Regarding literature and seemingly purely literary works, "Bird Language and Animal Speech," "The Adventures of a Small Banknote," "The Song of the Striking," and "Young Printer" can be considered the most noteworthy works with thought, content, and power. The progressive increase of the era in "Bird Language and Animal Speech" is very clear, and the underlying meaning is cool and delicious. It is a fairy tale, a novel, and a fable. Among the many fairy tales written by Mr. Ye Shengtao, I think this is a masterpiece that can best bite into the reality of the current turbulent era! I hope everyone will pay attention to reading such a good article and not let it go lightly. "The Song of the Striking," the story is old, but it is equipped with national consciousness, so that it reappears with a new posture and a new soul for children to read; this tragic and passionate historical story, which is enough to inspire, is also a very beneficial tonic in today's country, where difficulties are accumulating and spirits are fading. Feng Zikai's "New Year," writes about art in a smooth and moving way, like a story. Once you get it in your hand, you have to read it in one breath, and it can also be said to be a good work. Other scientific texts, such as the works of Gu Junzheng, Jia Zuzhang, and Jin Zhonghua, come from experts and are equally mature and attractive, making you feel unusually relaxed and happy after reading them.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say this solemnly, although "Children's Year" has slipped past for a few months in a calm manner, but with this "New Youth," it can be considered that there is some contribution and it has not been wasted. I hope that "New Youth" will shoulder the responsibility of saving the children, enrich the content, and publish regularly with a new attitude, and that the children will always enjoy this good food and beautiful sacrament as much as possible! I also hope that all the children will accept this food and sacrament that is most beneficial to you, and sincerely and continuously enjoy it...</p>
<h3 id="e170">Number Three <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Shune</p>
<p>The warm sunshine sweeps away the frozen hues from the horizon, and the spirit of spring descends upon the human world: this is the vitality of a glorious future! "New Youth," we will joyfully watch it sprout tender branches, grow fresh green leaves, and bloom splendid flowers: life is filling our garden!</p>
<p>Yingying and I are together holding a copy of the inaugural issue of "New Youth," casually flipping through it to Mr. Shengtao's "Bird and Beast Language," reading along with a simple mood: the author's simple descriptions give me a deep intoxication! Look: "The bronze statue is of a man on horseback, wearing a military helmet, with two upturned mustaches, an arrogant and conceited appearance. The sparrow said, "What is this thing? Let's take a look." Saying that, it stopped on the military helmet of the bronze statue. The squirrel nimbly climbed up the body of the bronze statue, stopping only at the part of the mustache on the right, and he also raised his tail upwards. Looking from below, one only felt that the bronze statue had missed a shave when trimming his mustache." This kind of playful and innocent narrative is very much in the spirit of a child, finding the elements of true poetry in it; I am immersed in the beauty of this poem, feeling exceptionally relaxed! Although it contains the contemplation of children, it is aimed at a clear understanding of the real society. It evokes for us the hypocritical appearance of general feudal relics, and points out to us: "(The sparrow said): "Yesterday I went out for a stroll and flew to the front of that educator's house and saw him writing an article with his head bowed. ... It turned out that he was writing a primary school textbook for humans, saying that primary school textbooks often contain bird and beast language, letting primary school students associate with birds and beasts, ... inevitably making their thinking unclear and their behavior improper, no different from birds and beasts." But "if humans associate with us, does that humiliate them? Are our thoughts particularly unclear, and our behavior particularly improper? Are their thoughts not unclear, and their behavior not improper?" Look! How cleverly sharp is this sarcasm! I have unconsciously felt that the fairy tale art expressed contains poetic innocence, but is full of pity and disgust for mankind! Let the squirrels scold: "Humans are really confused and arrogant things!" Because the inferiority and cruelty of humans have provided them with powerful examples. All "municipal government matters that are judged before finding examples are called arbitrary; this is not very appropriate." The author repeatedly earnestly reminds: "We must look for examples." Everything must be thoroughly investigated in order to increase knowledge and experience." It is indeed an excellent lesson for young people.</p>
<p>Mr. Zikai's "The Adventures of a Small Banknote" possesses the same significance. The story is about Zhu Rongsheng picking up a banknote at school. He spent a lot of effort hiding it, and later went back to give it to his mother for buying rice for dinner, but his mother told him: "Ah Rong! This must have been lost by your classmate. You should give it to the teacher and return it to the owner. How can we use it?" The gentle words harmonize with the solemn thought, making people yearn for the purity of maternal love when reading it!</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's "Little New Year Printer," although only the beginning of the story, the truthful narrative about the protagonist Zhao Yuansheng, especially the psychological description, gives the reader an indelible and deep impression. When he turned back and "Zhou Jiafu stepped on the rickshaw," whistling and calling Zhao Yuansheng to come to the car, he "stretched out a middle finger and waved it in Zhao Yuansheng's face, laughing wildly and shouting: "Nothing -- treating you -- haha!" Zhao Yuansheng's face suddenly turned red, and then turned white again." The brazenness of a wealthy young man and the shame felt by a poor child after being ridiculed are clearly displayed before our eyes, forming the opposition of two different social strata! When Zhou Jiafu asked the rickshaw puller to open his schoolbag and give Zhao Yuansheng something, "How can I accept things from others in front of the rickshaw puller? I would rather die than take it!" Zhao Yuansheng thought fiercely in his heart, and his face flushed." However, before the fundamental transformation of the current social conditions, such contradictory psychological phenomena are unavoidable for everyone. Perhaps this is the key to the development of the story.</p>
<p>Mr. Song Yunbin's "Song of Sorrowful Striking" is a historical account of Jing Ke's assassination of the King of Qin. The author uses a "historical eye" and agile techniques to extract a section of Jing Ke's preparation to go to the Qin state, rendering it with a modern spirit and transforming it into a new creation. The portrayal of the personality of a historical figure is the most delicate, without any exaggeration. Like: ""If the Crown Prince treats me like this, then killing the King of Qin is like killing a dog!" Dog Butcher Jia said excitedly." ""When you see the King of Qin, just treat him like a dog, and you won't panic." Butcher Jia said with a smile." The rough form of a dog butcher is portrayed extremely vividly! Also, like: "The current situation is very serious... Mr. Tian died at this time, it is always related to the current situation." Being able to put himself in the place of the ancients and use a tragic tone to depict the tense situation at the time, the writing is vivid and colorful. At this time of declining national spirit, I believe it is indeed a stimulant for young people.</p>
<p>In the story, the principles of art are incorporated. Mr. Zikai's "New Year Greetings" is of great help to the appreciation of art. Mr. Shengtao's "Article Exhibition" precisely analyzes famous works, from which we know the principles of the composition of literary and artistic works. Summarizing the activities of mankind, there is Mr. Jin Zhonghua's "The Power of the World." Explaining natural phenomena and their causal relationships, there is Mr. Song Yi's "The Words of the Moon" and Mr. Ding Xiao's "The Yellow River's Water Comes from the Sky." Others, such as Mr. Jun Zheng's "Flight Recorder" and "The Secret of Seeing," melt scientific theories into the furnace of literature, allowing them to appear in a light and graceful posture, without "distorting" the facts. Mr. Jia Zuzhang's "The Master of Antarctica - The Penguin" and Mr. Keshi's "Animals Wandering on the Crossroads" are masterpieces of scientific essays. In addition, the "Youth Reading Room" systematically and concisely reports the current affairs of the past half month, which is simple and pleasing.</p>
<p>Indeed! The content of "New Youth" is extremely rich. I want to affirm that this is the most desirable youth reading material of 1936!</p>
<h3 id="e171">What I Hope for "New Youth" <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Qiyi</p>
<p>Being able to "appreciate literature and art, understand nature, and understand society" is really not an easy task. However, we grow up in this era, and we cannot fail to understand this knowledge related to practical life. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is, we must try our best to enlighten our understanding. However, it is not very good to rely solely on our own exercises, and we must also rely on advanced people to take on the responsibility of guidance. In this way, we can prevent ourselves from being confused by some erroneous views and falling into a dangerous situation during the exercise period.</p>
<p>The "New Youth," which appeared in a brand-new posture, can be said to be produced to meet our needs. After reading the inaugural issue, I was very satisfied because such youth reading materials cannot be considered anything but progressive. Recently, the "New Youth Society" is soliciting readers' opinions, so I wrote down my hopes for "New Youth":</p>
<p>(1) In the inaugural issue, I feel that there are too many articles about natural science. Although natural science is also very important, and the works are written in a very popular and interesting way, without any dryness, I hope that it is best to strive for an average amount of the three types of articles "Literature and Art," "Social Science," and "Natural Science" in each issue, avoiding focusing on one subject.</p>
<p>(2) I hope that "New Youth" can publish more research methods for various disciplines. Because learning with a purpose is extremely dangerous, and this kind of article is no different from the stepping stone to explore the path. In addition, if possible, it is best to answer various questions for readers for a long time.</p>
<p>(3) At this time, everyone who has awakened is concerned about the current situation. Therefore, lively current affairs issues need to be studied extremely. I hope that "New Youth" can also take this into account and conduct more detailed analysis and research on current affairs trends.</p>
<p>These three points are my opinions for the improvement of "New Youth."</p>
<p>The last point is that I hope that the editors of "New Youth" can take responsibility and guide young people to embark on a new path. On the one hand, we must strive to enrich the content of the publication, so that this "New Youth" can become the eternal friend of the vast youth group!</p>
<p>These are my current hopes for "New Youth."</p>

<h3 id="e172">Want Money, Not Life <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to reports, a certain hospital in the French Concession recently, in order to imitate European and American blood transfusion treatment, specifically published an advertisement seeking blood donors. The age limit is 18 to 30 years old, regardless of gender, anyone can apply. Applicants must first undergo a physical examination and blood type test, and then be notified to draw blood on time and given a considerable blood fee. The number of people is limited to six per day. It is reported that many people have gone to apply in recent days, most of whom are unemployed, aiming to get some price to maintain their lives for a few days.</p>
<p>Selling blood to maintain life is indeed a sad situation. However, in today's society, except for a very small number of parasites who do not work for a living, most people rely on selling their brainpower or labor to make a living. Selling brainpower or labor is also a difficult task. But there is still a group of people who have brainpower or labor to sell but cannot find an employer. Their situation is even more difficult, being ostracized from the circle of life, crying for hunger and cold, and struggling with the demons of life. Therefore, a group of unemployed people are eager for work, as frantic as hungry dogs looking for food. As long as there is food to eat, no matter how difficult the job is, even if it kills their own lives, they are willing to take on the task. Selling blood is of course very pitiful. Blood is the source of life, and the most indispensable treasure of the human body. We absorb nutrients every day in order to replenish blood. Who would be willing to sell blood? But what if you don't sell it? Starving is more uncomfortable than drawing blood, even though the price obtained from selling blood is at most enough to maintain a few days of life.</p>
<p>It is said that there are blood sellers abroad who specialize in drawing blood for people. However, this is limited to a kind of particularly strong person, even if they draw blood, it will not harm their health. In recent years, hospitals in our country have also often adopted blood transfusion therapy, so advertisements for seeking blood donors are often seen in the newspaper. And every time the result of the solicitation is that applicants flock in, vying to be the first. A year ago, the wife of a friend of mine had surgery in a certain hospital, and the doctor also used blood transfusion to treat her. At that time, there were more than 20 people who came to apply. Later, a rickshaw puller was considered lucky (in fact, the most unfortunate) to qualify, and the rest went back disappointed. Five hundred cubic centimeters of blood was drawn, and the price was fifteen yuan. The doctor told him to eat more spinach and pig liver when he went back to nourish his body, and he needed to rest for three to five days before it would harm his health. But how did he answer? He said thank you for your kindness, to be honest, I can't afford pig liver. A family of four, this fifteen yuan, I must use sparingly and eat sparingly, at least maintain two or three months of life, and it is inevitable that I will suffer from hunger again.</p>
<p>Are they wanting money, not life?</p>
<h3 id="e173">On the Road to Climbing Zhuazhua Creek <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Today, it is another poisonous day! Standing at the intersection at the other end of Guanyin Bridge, looking at the sun tightly hidden behind Dongshan Mountain, I felt a chill in my heart. But in the scheduled itinerary, today, in the evening, we need to rest in Songkan Town.</p>
<p>—Let's go, it's not early, the sun has already passed the top of the mountain! The porter shouted, his rough and hoarse throat like a broken gong.</p>
<p>—It's fifteen miles uphill to Datianjiao!</p>
<p>Fifteen miles is simply nothing in the boundless fields, and the porter's strong legs are so fast that they arrive in an unintentional moment. That is exactly the border between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces!</p>
<p>How is the provincial border divided? What are the obvious signs? I don't know, I only feel that there is a slight difference in the uniforms of the soldiers. Are people still wrapping their heads like that? The accents still contain the local dialect of Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>—Eat glutinous rice cake, come, the glutinous rice cake here is famous. Little Liu encouraged me, pulling me down from the pole.</p>
<p>The main ingredients of glutinous rice cake are a mixture of glutinous rice flour and some yellow rice flour. A broken iron stove with three cracks is roasting three or four cakes. The proprietress is over forty years old, and the wind and frost have deepened the wrinkles on her forehead. This unexpected business has aroused her surprise. Pull down the oilcloth curtain outside the pole, sit on it, let the mood calm down, and silently recite the rhythm of the rain.</p>
<p>Hotel Town, fill your stomach once, look, the rain has stopped, and dark clouds are still pressing down on the surrounding mountains. Porter Zhang squeezed over and said -- you still have to be careful ahead!</p>
<p>The shadows of last night immediately floated in my mind again. Isn't it, the wilderness is so quiet, even the sound of the bells of the donkeys carrying things cannot be heard, where to call for help?</p>
<p>—Old Zhang, is the front as dangerous as Jiupanzi?</p>
<p>He smiled, his expression simply extraordinary, shaking his hands, his head bent down with his waist. He told us that Guizhou Province is working hard on the construction of highways. When blasting along the mountains, the miserable cries of many monkeys fleeing were unbearable to see.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, on the winding path, slowly reaching the avenue that has not yet been officially completed at Xinwenguan. The road surface is not flat, and yellow mud and small gravel are laid on the entire road. After two hours, the mud is slippery, overflowing from the edge of the straw shoes into the soles of the feet, and the legs are heavier.</p>
<p>—Clap, clap, clap, clap,... The clear and crisp sound of the wheels hitting the mountain stones, shaking the dull air, followed by a boom, as if something had slid down, with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>—Did you hear that? This is the mountain opening work for building the road! Old Zhang said! Turn around the mountain corner ahead, and there is a bridge built, just at the end of the bridge! His finger drew a direction.</p>
<p>Standing on the bridge, underneath, if estimated in feet, there should be about twenty feet. The water, swirling, hit the rocks and splashed, embracing each other, and rushing downwards.</p>
<p>—Be careful! Hold on tight: the mud on the right mountain is slippery after the rain, don't fall into the slope! The three porters were so anxious, repeatedly warning, the blue veins on their foreheads were throbbing.</p>
<p>Really, this journey of twenty or thirty feet is a moment of life and death. The width is just enough for single guests to come and go. There is no shelter on the side. The mountain on the right is so high, and the little monkeys cleverly follow the sound of the bombing and run on it. But you can't look, maybe you will lose your life in a glance. The left side is even more unnecessary to mention, the shape of the cliff will make your legs weak.</p>
<p>Flower basket pole, carrying pole,... carefully passed, what about us, climb, grab, bite our lips, suppress the fearful mood, heart beating, ears roaring, the blood in the whole body rushing rapidly. Looking, almost all over, only Lao Tie is tightly pressing the sedan chair and is stepping into the entrance. In the sedan chair, there is an elderly man who has fallen asleep blankly.</p>
<p>—Slow down, don't pass, the worker looked at the already lit fire, desperately shouting but it was too late, Tie, they have already walked one-third of the distance. Go back? The retreat is even more difficult, it can't be done.</p>
<p>The medicine exploded, and the stones above rolled down like rain. The largest one looked like it was going to land on the top of the sedan chair. A sharp sword pierced many hearts, tightly covering their eyes with their hands, unwilling to let this terrible tragedy jump into their eyes.</p>
<p>How fortunate, the stone grazed the corner of the sedan chair and rolled down, the sedan chair swayed several times, without falling into the abyss. This should be attributed to the strength of the porters!</p>
<p>Breathing out a stuffy breath, we are discussing the way to reward them in tonight's lodging place.</p>
<h3 id="e174">A Scholarly Family <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>After the beginning of spring, the weather is still so cold: the wind pounces over the fields like a wild beast, pounces over the crops, pounces over the dead little town.</p>
<p>In the fields, it is as desolate as an ancient tomb; a few clusters of residual rice stalks are scattered and overturned on the dry and cracked ground -- that ground, in the prosperous era of the past, was also moistened by the sweat of their master's labor and the laughter and scolding of hope: "Damn it, look at this land, it's shiny, it's really good for making cakes"! -- but now, everything has become a light dream of the past. The sweat of hope and labor has been sucked dry, and people, like the rice stalks eroded by the frost and snow of winter, have withered and fallen, in the sharp and cold north wind, on the barren and dry ground...</p>
<p>The past is already past! Chongren Second Grandpa, shivering and wrapped in a dry and thin body inside a broken cotton robe that I can't remember how many years old it is, walked along the half-built highway leading to the little town, an indescribable sad feeling constantly playing a role in the gloomy sunlight; this role constantly aroused some nostalgic desolation, some declining and withering sorrow, and some other inexplicable resentment and sigh: "The good times are long gone, now it is... now it is... it's our turn to suffer. Scholars! Ha! Also considered a scholarly family. Now - what evil did the ancestors commit!"</p>
<p>It is a kind of shame! This shame endlessly just hit his heart like cold rain: Thirty years ago, wasn't his family still so glorious and prominent? Chongren Second Grandpa! Who in this small place doesn't know if you say it. The grandfather was a zhuangyuan, the father released two terms of daotai, and himself, was also received the "grace" of the country, and at a young age, he won the juren, and was also a "Jinshen."</p>
<p>It can also be said to be "showing off the ancestors and glorifying the clan," right? A large family, inherited from the ancestors, really began to vigorously "prosper" in the hands of Chongren Second Grandpa, bought fields, and built houses (in the house, there was also a plaque of "Imperial Gift" of "Zhuangyuan Mansion" passed down from the ancestors -- but now, the house has been torn down so that no trace can be found, and the original land has been built into the private residence of the nouveau riche with the surname Wang who "prospered" in the foreign goods business in Shanghai. And that plaque of "Imperial Gift" - Second Grandpa didn't dare to think about it anymore - maybe it had been chopped into pieces and thrown into the stove to be used as kindling, burned piece by piece...</p>
<p>Burned! The good days, like being thrown into the fire, have turned into ashes. The world suddenly changed its appearance, and people's braids were gone. Therefore, the reputation and prominence of his own family also disappeared day by day with the old world, like a strange dream, like a beautiful bubble.</p>
<p>"What evil did the ancestors commit?" I often think so. "Also considered a scholarly family," what kind of trick is this? Chongren Second Grandpa never understood it. Those fields, those houses, those servants, concubines, and those past glories that often appeared in dreams, passed by, all belonged to others. The age is getting older day by day, and the days are passing by in the situation of selling family property; now, everything is over, leaving only himself, a dying trunk, and this trunk is deeply containing the essence of opium.</p>
<p>I can't figure it out! Let's talk about his own two sons! Didn't they receive the education of "sages and sages" when they were young? But raised to be so big! Ha, one got a woman in the village, quietly like a wisp of smoke, I don't know where he is wandering: and the younger one? Damn it! Didn't someone come from Shanghai last year and bring such a letter: "Second Grandpa, your second young master is a robber in Shanghai and has been arrested and is going to jail!"</p>
<p>"What kind of world is this?"</p>
<p>It's over! Everything is over! The world has changed its appearance! "Scholarly children" will have to starve to death so silently (scholarly children still become robbers? Damn it! What evil did the ancestors commit!) What kind of world is this!</p>
<p>Thinking of his own such old age, "Juren" origin! Just now he went to the Zhang family, a nouveau riche family in the town with a little kinship, to "think of a way" and was even scolded by the people at the door! Thinking of the only two dry steamed buns he had eaten in the past two days, thinking that even the stolen "Japanese noodles" were about to run out! Walking on the half-built highway, Chongren Second Grandpa seemed to suddenly lose his balance, and suddenly squatted on the ground.</p>
<p>There was darkness in front of his eyes, he didn't feel anything: what he felt was just the past glory of his "scholarly family."</p>

<p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced the other day that China has purchased gold worth 90 million yuan from the United States, which has been shipped out of the country with a special license. Tan Laosan said, Zhou Along, is destined to be poor, and picking up gold will turn into copper, sighing the uselessness of gold.</p>
<p>U.S. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bidman spoke in the Senate, "severely criticizing Japan for dominating China and hindering U.S. trade rights, advocating strengthening naval and air forces, and not hesitating to fight Japan. Tan Laosan said, this song should only be found in heaven, how many times can it be heard in the world? A quick wit, should eat three cups of aged Shaoxing wine.</p>

<p>A-Qiao, oh dear! The man has been washed away by the water!</p>
<p>Old Woman: What is to become of us! (Crying, shouting) Someone, please save our old man! (The sound of gongs gradually approaches, the sounds of people in chaos, the sound of water, the sound of wind, the sound of rain!)</p>
<p>Old Wang: (Shouting from that location:) Get on the boat! Get on the boat! Xiao Lu: A-Qiao, A-Qiao! Where are you? (Sounds of hurried footsteps)</p>
<p>Wang Da Niang, A-Qiao: We're here! Come quickly!</p>
<p>Xiao Lu, Old Wang, and others run quickly! Get on the boat! (Wind and rain intertwine) (Everyone rushes onto the boat)</p>
<p>A-Qiao: What about Big Brother? Xiao Lu! How could you forget Big Brother!</p>
<p>Xiao Lu: Alas! It's good enough that some survived!</p>
<p>Old Wang: I told him to fall back, but he insisted on leading the charge. The flood came so suddenly! Thirty or forty people, it was like a tiger swallowing flies, swept away in an instant.</p>
<p>A-Qiao: (Crying) Big Brother is dead too, my heavens! Can't you open your eyes and see who are the good people and who are the bad people?</p>
<p>Old Wang: And that bald Li, he was washed away by the water, but then he swam back. We thought he was incredibly lucky, a true escape from death. Who knew that in the second surge, he went to heaven with another thirty or forty people!</p>
<p>Old Woman: What? Our Baldy is dead too? (Crying loudly) My heavens! Isn't it enough that the old man died? Do you have to take Little Baldy away too? How am I supposed to live! I might as well die too! (Attempts to jump into the river)</p>
<p>Wang Da Niang: Li Da Ma, you have to think positively. People who are dead cannot be brought back to life!</p>
<p>Old Wang: Why do you want to commit suicide? At this point, we can only resign ourselves to fate! It's better to be alive than dead. (Wang Da Niang cries incessantly, the sound of a child crying, the noisy voices of people!) (Shouting) Xiao Lu, hold steady! Be careful with the oars!</p>
<p>Xiao Lu: Look! The flood is coming! Everyone hold on tight! (A great sound of water)</p>
<p>A: Everyone cries out in alarm for a moment! The sound of rain gradually diminishes, the sound of wind disappears Wang Da Niang: Li Da Ma is gone!</p>
<p>A-Qiao: Xiao Lu, all our belongings are gone!</p>
<p>Old Wang: Being alive is the only blessing! (The sound of oars rowing rapidly, the sound of rain still present, the sound of water very loud!)</p>

<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening</p>
<p>Shiyin (1340) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>A slanting bridge leads into a courtyard, a stark chill rises. Silent, in the room, the treasure duck incense burner is damp. Regretful farewell and longing for spring, spring faintly illuminated. Encroaching on dreams, enough to dissipate the soul. I lazily do my makeup after waking from illness. Having drunk wine, I support my head, unable to restrain my thinness. Thinking of last night, the lamp flower continuously reported good news. But, the good times are shallow and unclear. Pleasantly, the parrot's intentions are heavy, its singing somewhat astringent. But, the swallow's heart is infatuated, complaining frequently. Already, the twenty-four seasonal winds and flowers send messages. Only the wandering silk threads and chaotic catkins are blocked by the gauze windows. I remember wandering through the garden, stepping over paths without end. A kind of affection is deeply engraved in my bones. I remember, comfortably, the study room is quiet with the curtain hook lowered. The sound of playing chess was sent from the depths of the hall. I remember, the thirteen mother-of-pearl pillars of the zither are selected. The jade ripples and pearl circles, truly the sound of white snow. I remember, secretly peeking from behind the screen, a smile on my face, secretly opening the way. The horse slips on the frost, walking under the moon. Now, I want to leave a conspicuous blade of grass on the riverbank. I will take my sorrow straight to the short and long pavilion. Only the dressmaking bees and butterflies are left, listless. Secretly buying rouge, embracing fallen flowers. Therefore, my gaze cuts off the green smoke and water by the bridge. The north of the magnolia hall tramples on the remaining spring. I resent the Eastern Emperor, spending all that thought.</p>
<p>Lu Qiuxia's Double Phoenix Pearls</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "The Jade Demise of Taizhen"</p>
<p>Since ancient times, beautiful women have had ill-fated lives. The news spreads that the lovely lady's soul has departed. In life, she pressed a book, a tribulation in the mortal world. In death, it is difficult to find her body after the tribulation. At that time, ten thousand miles of wind and clouds rose on the border. Lu Shan's soldiers mutinied in Fanyang City. Beacon fires filled the road to Hangu Pass. Approaching Chang'an, it was too uneasy. Therefore, the emperor was forced to flee to Sichuan. The Imperial Guards rallied to protect him. But who knew that General Weijia, Chen Wuli, was paying lip service and not advancing. The soldiers clamored and beat the drums wildly. But there was a sound of killing, swords clashing. First, the emperor's uncle and concubines were slaughtered. They also said, "If Yang Guifei is not killed, our anger will not be appeased." The king listened. The soldiers' hearts changed. Heaven and earth were turned upside down, and the ghosts and gods were alarmed. Making that Tang Dynasty emperor completely helpless. A shiver ran down his spine, his heart was in turmoil. He wanted to give up the beautiful woman. He did not care about the oath made on the Changsheng Hall. It was hateful that the government soldiers were so oppressive and violent. Their faces were ferocious, like tigers. Claiming to be the noble and precious Emperor. He could not, with all his heart, rescue a beautiful woman. Pitiful, Taizhen, with her jade-like and flower-like face. She was forced to commit suicide with a white silk. In an instant, jade was shattered, fragrance was extinguished, and her soul was cut off. Sad purple jade turned into smoke and dust. How can eternity be expressed? But, the dead beautiful woman will not be reborn. In the end, I, a stranger, have failed you. Don't say that the country is more important than the beauty. Pitiful, her beautiful face died under the pear blossom tree. Her fleeting smile was not destined to last. Today, with clear wine and fragrant brew, I offer a libation. The flowers are withered, the moon is waning, mourning her fragrant soul. The cuckoo cries blood with sadness, the candle burns to ashes, tears have fallen. Leaving me, unable to stop crying.</p>

<p>Laurence Tibbett is currently the mainstay of the Capital Theater in New York. His nightly remuneration is three thousand US dollars. In the film industry, he has starred in several films, such as "The Green Forest Charming Son," "New Moon" (the female lead is Grace Moore), and "Eternal Regret" (the female lead is Luo Fanli), all of which have been warmly welcomed by audiences. Now, he has been heavily recruited by 20th Century Fox to make the film "The Love History of Singing Partners," and the plot of this film is the true story of his life. Everything he has encountered in his success and in the arena of love is written in detail and is extremely moving. It is said that the film will be screened at the Cathay soon, and it is expected to cause a sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e182">"Girl in Disguise" Yong'an Photography Notes <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>The Yihua Company's new sound film, "Girl in Disguise," written by Huang Ximo and directed by Fang Peilin, borrowed a scene from the Yong'an Company's photographic department store, one of Shanghai's three major companies, last night (the 15th). In addition to the full participation of more than 100 Yihua staff and actors, they also received enthusiastic assistance from Yong'an's colleagues, helping with the performance. It was truly an unprecedented event. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Not long after eight o'clock struck, Yihua's large team, loaded onto ten large trucks, marched in a grand manner, as if facing a formidable enemy. Cameras and a large number of props displayed their power in the magnificent building.</p>
<p>Preparations began, moving equipment, arranging lights, and setting up the camera. People surged like a tide, like the sun rising. Inside the entire Yong'an Company, only a multitude of heads moved, and thousands of shadows swayed. When the lights were turned on, the bright glass sparkled with gold, like a silver world, which was extremely beautiful. Each position did not stop for even a moment. By eleven o'clock at night, everything was arranged properly, and the filming work began actively.</p>
<p>The scene being filmed that night was Yuan Meiyun's return from Nanyang, led by her grandfather Wang Guilin to visit Shanghai's popular shopping mall. Because Yuan Meiyun was dressed as an elegant young gentleman, several modern girls flirted with her, which was a very exciting scene.</p>
<p>Twelve o'clock was the time for char siu buns. A thousand char siu buns were moved down from Dale. The staff finally took a short break at this point, wolfing down the buns to prepare for the next work.</p>
<p>The char siu bun time passed, and then filming continued smoothly with the hard work of everyone.</p>
<p>When the filming was completed, everyone cheered like triumphant soldiers. But at this time, the sky was already beginning to turn white in the east. The streets of the metropolis would be active again at seven o'clock. Ten large trucks carried this large group of people on the road of triumph. Facing the early spring breeze, everyone's faces were full of radiance, a kind of joy and comfort from a satisfactory job.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Lianhua Tidbits <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The filming of "The Lost Lamb" is intensifying, and it should be completed by the end of this month. The last scene of Huacun has been set up, and filming will take place soon. Once the Huacun scenes are completed, the entire team will set off for Suzhou. When they return in triumph, it will be the day that "The Lost Lamb" is fully completed.</p>
<p>Both Fei Boqing and Hong Quan have always played villains in films. In "Lang Tao Sha," Fei plays a slick and treacherous husband who dies at the hands of Jin Xia. When filming this scene, Lao Jin swung his iron fist, and Fei Boqing, who was weak and frail, was not really beaten to death, but he was dizzy and almost lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Zheng Yingshi's young son, at the strong invitation of Cai Chusheng, made an appearance in "The Lost Lamb."</p>
<p>"Go to Nature" filmed a scene in a wooden house on an island. The season was midsummer. It was already difficult for the actors to work naked in the sweltering weather, but because of the plot, they also had to drag a fan and suffer from the cold wind. From our cold perspective, this wooden house on the island is simply an asylum for those with wind sickness.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli has changed his previous style in "The Lost Lamb." Zheng said: "I hope that I can be a versatile actor. The role I play in The Lost Lamb is my biggest attempt."</p>
<p>"Song of a Loving Mother" is the most spectacular film co-produced by all the male and female actors of Lianhua. Because there are so many actors in this film, the atmosphere on the set has been even more lively recently.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Key Roles in "Iron-Blooded General" <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Interesting Story of a Tall Husband and a Short Wife</p>
<p>Hollywood is truly a mysterious place. Many tall male actors on the silver screen are married to short wives. Let's examine the cast of "Iron-Blooded General" to understand this. In this film, there are three actors whose height exceeds six feet two inches. These three are the protagonist, and their wives are the smallest women in the film city. Ai Luoyu is only five feet tall and weighs less than one hundred pounds. Luo Ba Bala's wife is five feet one inch tall and weighs ninety-eight pounds. Alexander's wife is a famous actress and is taller, but is only five feet tall. Furthermore, "Iron-Blooded General" will be screened at the Da Guangming soon.</p>
