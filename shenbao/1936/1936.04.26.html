<h3 id="c1">有田招待各國記者　說明日本外交　對華對俄實行和平政策對英美並要求通商自由 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（東京）有田外相、二十五日下午三時半、在其官邸、接見外國新聞記者、闡明日本政府外交方針、天羽情報部長亦在其席、外相旋與記者以一問一答之形式、說明具體政策、至五時始畢、外相對記者表示之外交方針內容如下、</p>
<p>日本外交方針、日皇曾於日本退出國聯時頒發詔書闡明、迄今未有變更、吾人安定東亞、與友邦諸國親密國交、以期貢獻於世界和平、及人類幸福、夫世界和平之維持、從來既有多數辦法、被人提倡、種種方法、迭有實施、然未曾見其充分效果、吾人深信、世界列國應拔除威脅和平之各種根本原因、而在實力所及之範圍內、進行最善努力、維持和平、在日本而論、安定東亞事業、為國家存立上之生死問題、且係對於世界之天與責務、而為達成此重責、吾人應以「滿洲國」為中心、與其接隣國、卽中俄兩國之間、設定善隣關係、以圖安定大局、是為必要、</p>
<p>據聞最近在滿俄滿蒙邊境方面、頻發紛爭之結果、歐美方面盛傳種種流言、然吾人非有對手之侵略行動、决無自動出於非法侵略行動之舉、蘇聯與日滿之間、現有種種懸案、吾人信此等懸案均可以外交交涉圓滿解决、中日兩國為同文同種、有唇齒輔車之關係、兩國以共存共樂為主要宗旨、自不待言、然因兩國隣接、自然發生種種問題、是亦不得已者也、但吾人切望東亞二大友邦、親善提携、以確保東亞和平、在歐美方面、往往有人對於日本對華政策、加以惡意批評、然此等諸國、若在日本立塲、正視實際情勢、則必可釋然諒解吾人態度、</p>
<p>吾人又在他方面常與英美及其他諸國增進彼此邦交、而對於還繞太平洋諸國之國交、尤加特別留意、最近日本與此等諸國之間、時見貿易通商之利害衝突、然由互相依之見地、加以適宜調整、並非難存事也、吾人在此時際、為振興世界經濟、促進國際和平起見、擬恢復通商自由、釀成國際問自由與信賴之空氣、此事對於人類福祉與繁榮上、必為一大貢獻、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">蘇俄所提　不侵犯條約　有田謂無訂立必要 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（東京）有田外相對外國新聞記者闡明外交方針後　外國記者發出種種質問、茲錄記者與外相問答情形如下、</p>
<p>美方面有人慮日俄戰爭之發生、閣見　如何、</p>
<p>現在情形未到戰爭發生之程度、歐美方面誇張事實、流布謠言、亦未可知、</p>
<p>日俄戰爭不可能乎、</p>
<p>拿破崙曾曰、吾人辭典中未有「不可能」之字、</p>
<p>日俄關係、比數年以前、不加惡化乎、</p>
<p>現在比前多懸案、且增加國境問題等事件、</p>
<p>日本有無訂立日俄不侵犯條約之意、</p>
<p>昭和七年、當芳澤駐法大使回國途中、經過莫斯科時、蘇俄李維諾夫外長有此提議、然因時期尙早、加以拒絕、日本對俄提議處理國境紛爭、及設立確定國境委員會、在實際上效果較大、日本今日亦以此方針進行交涉、</p>
<p>蘇聯在遠東增加軍備、日本有無要求蘇聯减少遠東軍、使其軍力與日平等之意、</p>
<p>日本頗關心蘇聯在遠東保持過大軍備之事、减少蘇聯軍備、可以緩和兩國間空氣、此人人所承認者、然日本未曾以蘇俄遠東軍之撤退或减少、為對俄交涉之題目、</p>
<p>法俄互相援助條約、對於日本對俄外交、有何影響、</p>
<p>法國雖聲明、此條約對遠東不及其力、然日本方面一部分人觀察、蘇俄以該條約獲得西部國境之安全保障、將來可活動其餘力、在遠東加强勢力、</p>
<h3 id="c3">外間所傳　日德密約說　一部份人熱心於此 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>日本有無訂立日德同盟、以對抗法俄條約之意、</p>
<p>日本一部分人、熱心主張日德提携、然政府當局未曾考慮此問題、</p>
<h3 id="c4">日本對華　所謂三原則　有田謂當行其精神 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>貴大臣曾任駐華大使、在南京會見蔣介石張羣兩氏、其影響如何、</p>
<p>本人與南京首腦部之會談、目的在於加深兩方諒解程度、並非討論一定題之正式交涉、故未能說出其具體效果、但由本人在此會談所受印象而論、中日兩國問前途困難甚多、須要非常大努力、</p>
<p>日本是吾以所謂三原則進行對華交涉</p>
<p>本人决意承繼廣田前外相之方針、並以三原則之精神、實現中日提携、</p>
<p>三原則之適用方法、以强壓手段乎、或依互讓的方法、</p>
<p>無用强壓政策之必要、互相以和平手段、漸次加增兩國提携密度、固不待論也、（二十五日同盟社電）</p>

<h3 id="c47">德國的備戰（上） <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Louis　Fischer　賓符譯</p>
<p>我所希望道次逗留在柏林而獲解答的最重要的問題是：德國的食物和財政恐慌，是否會大大影響牠整軍計畫的完成？現在我知道了道個回答是否定的。</p>
<p>德國的工業生產已達到了戰後的高峯。但大都是既不能喫又不能穿的。德國把它大量的資金在軍用品上凍結了。據專家估計，現在有職業的人比之一九三三年一月多了三百萬——七十五萬以上是普通職員，七十五萬以上是士兵水手，而一百五十萬以上是工人；但那消費的貨量在比例上却仍是極低。從一九三三年一月到一九三四年十月，工人和小職員的實際工資，减低了百分之二十五，而德國生活水準在希特勒統治下的一般低落，約為百分之三〇到三十五。如果把生產品低劣的品質也算了進去，這衰落的情形還要糟些。希特勒和許多報紙都預料一九三六年將有更甚的困難和犧牲。文斯楚（Josepn　Winschun）在去年十二月卅一日德意志普通報上會說：「工資的水準殆再不能忍受進一步的物價上昇了」。戈培爾則說工資是不能增加的。然而食物的缺乏却又使物價高漲着。誠如文斯楚自己所說，輸出是必須獎勵的，而一生活水準應該為此捺减些」。一九三六這一年沒有什麼救濟和改艮的諾言。可是，那敏說的觀察家，無論是德國人或外國人，都以為德國軍需工業的生產，在一九三六年的前六個月中，確將大大加緊了，只有到六月以後，因現金奇緊纔會减低下去。德國軍隊的技術工具——飛機·大砲·坦克軍等等——將在一九三六年達到最高點，那時，軍隊就能充分應戰了。</p>
<p>然而從別方面看來，一九三六年却不能說是德國備戰完成的時候。全國徽兵纔只開始，國防軍的隊伍還不足與主要強國一戰。那增多的軍官和參謀們也不　學得現代戰爭所需要的效能和智識。歐戰的宿將已經老了，體格上固然不能勝任，技術上也落了伍。德國必須等候着，等候那班新微的數百萬靑年成為能夠受長期艱苦戰爭的兵士。但這要等到什麼時候呢？有的專家說是一九三七年，多數說是一九三八年，也有說是一九三九年的。國防軍現在連官兵合計约為八十萬人，到一九三九年，就可有一百萬武裝兵士和二百五十萬的後備兵了，這纔是一個足以打一次初仗的大砲糧食的數量哩。</p>
<p>主要的問題是原料。政府一面將竭力以「淸算協定」向海外購入脂肪，但一面却將盡可能的用外國通貨去換得原料的輸入。倘若遇到封鎖或國聯的制裁，德國因受自然富源的限制，也許支持不了長期的戰爭。德國每年的石油消費量為三百五十萬噸，很少是在國內開發的。在有許多地方，鑛孔雖已鑿好，油苗雖有發現，但油井則都被封閉着留待將來的開發。綜合石油的製造業，有驚人的進步。德國已能出產每年汽油消費量的三分之一，一九二八年可以增到三分之二，一九三九年便可達百分之百了。如果馬路上的私人汽車絕了跡，那一九三八年國內的汽油產量是儘夠抵銷汽油輸入的必要了。德國現在還積貯着大量的石油。友好的國家都給幫助着。空軍是需要極上等的油的，德國可缺少煉油的技術經騐。因此，那美孚公司（The　Americn　Socony－Vacuanm　Company）最近在漢堡建造了一所製煉廠，專事提煉航空油，這廠今年就可以完工了。</p>
<p>各處實騐室都在研究着鋼·鐵·銅·棉花和硫黃的代用品。常局對於一切不含鐵質的金屬在工業上的用處都有科學的記錄。常戰爭時這種貯藏——例如地下電報綫——就將被採用的。德國並且投資匈牙利大豆，南斯拉夫鐵　土（Fauxite）和保加利亞烟葉的生產；在奧大利最大冶金廠阿爾賓蒙登公司（Alpine－Montan　Company）的三百萬股份中，德國的聯合鋼鐵廠（Vereinigte　Stahlwerke）就佔有了一百七十萬股。德國之所以這樣做，原想在戰時從這些源泉取得原料的供給。</p>
<p>軍隊的定貨是德國重工業的中要糧食，而重工業的活動也全受軍事計畫的支配。勃蘭登堡的奧貝爾（Opelt)大汽車廠，正由軍部主持建造着。在德國，還有普通摩托工廠和國際電話電報公司的工廠，雖然是美國的資本，但却不許仟何美國人進去；因為牠們是製造軍備的啊。</p>
<p>整個德國是一個大軍營。像我這種久離德國的人就可看到國防軍的軍單和制服的　著增加。現在，在柏林街上疾馳過的普通軍車，都用假裝掩飾着。這是實際備戰的一面。但也就是心理備戰的一面。說到心理備戰，現在正是每天每點鐘在報紙中，無錢電中以及學校中極緊張地進行着。</p>
<p>德國的心理動員是非常之重要的。每個國家都在公開地擴張着軍備。這種現象成了一種常態誰也不再想着每天早晚從數萬萬人類中竊去的鞋·襪·襯衫·麵包·肉·牛油·藥品·以及舒適和快樂了。有時人們甚至會歸結說趨於這樣瘋在狀態的人類，確乎該有戰爭來肅淸一下。心理動自就是在刺激人們接受擴張軍備結果的貧困的因循態度。每個政府吿訴它的人民說，軍備是保護或維持國家威信和光榮所必需的。德國的報紙常對希特勒表示敬意，因為他一九三五年三月十六日的徵兵演說，恢復了德國的驕傲和自信。據說，德國就是為此纔集中牠工業的力量於備戰的。我並不輕視國家主義和愛國心在政治上的意義。但我却不信「納粹」整軍計晝的主要目標是為了滿足道種感情。一定還有別的目標。怕是領土的侵略吧？德國的政治家是否認的，但是除此之外還能有什麼呢？他們儘管抗議否認。事實上，德國歸罪布爾雪維克的俄國發動侵略企圖，正跟羅馬歸罪阿比西尼亞是侵略者一樣。德國人硬說他們是和平的，希特勒的幾次演說常被柏林引為德國深愛和平的明證。然而客覜的眞理難道能求之於強辯者嗎？</p>
<p>德國人常是出名的不中用外交家，理由是他們不大信任外交，因此　致力於此很少。他們尊重的是實力；他們嘲笑空談。一九三三年一日希特勒上台了。波籣喫了一驚。因為在前一年，國聯允許了德國軍備平等，所以華沙恐戄着由那絕對國家主義的「納粹」統治下的武裝的德國，將要嚴重地威脅但澤和走廊。因此，一九三三年三月，已故畢蘇資基將軍把五大團的軍隊集中於德境的附近，並饗應英法對法西斯德國發動防止戰爭的企圖。據傳當時法國參謀總長魏剛（Gen　Ｗeygend）對這意思會極為注意。到四月，波蘭軍隊佔據了但澤區的狹長地帶未斯忒帕拉堆（Westerplatte）。看來很像戰爭就要開始了。一九三三年五月十七日，希特勒在國會中發表了冗長的和平演說，他聰明地宣稱：「新的歐戰不能創造一種勝於今日的情況。………德國常常情願擔任國際間進一步的安全義務………德國已準備廢除牠全部的軍事設施了。」世界各國多半不知這種諾言原是為了擋開一次迫近的戰爭。西歐列強自然樂於聽希特勒的話，因為他們並不要打仗。巴黎也終於否决了　蘇資基提出的防止戰爭。</p>

<p>日使館武官　今井否認簽訂防共協定　日軍擴充地區說亦不確永見亦未談商華北外交　　北平通信、北平日大使館武官附今井武夫、最近規定每星期五日、接見中外新聞界、今（二十四）日為第一次、到記者甚多、分三批接見、最初為歐美各國記者、次為日本記者、最後接見中國記者、茲誌其所談如次、　　今井氏首先對記者稱、「今日與諸君見面、無何紐斯可言、惟聞天津學生有全體罷課、並遊行示威之傳說、卒賴該地公安局防範得法、未成事實、就予（今井自稱）推想、天津學生此次之風傳、不無有人操縱、例如去年上海學生運動之勃起、卽為明證、復次、共匪此次竄擾山西後、平津兩地潛伏之共黨、活動甚力、且有在天津設立支部、負責指揮之說、因是日本對於兩地治安前途、殊為關心、蓋共黨在華北活動、不僅是中國之害、抑與日本有切膚之感、華北當局頃正在向建設之途邁進、對於當前之共禍、防範不謂不嚴、第應百尺竿頭、更進一步、設法消弭隱患、以期政治日臻光明、予今日讀中國某報社論、指共黨為新國賊新漢奸云云、實獲我心、殊不勝希望中國當局依此去做、而謀華北之安寗」、　　談至此、有人問今井、詢以歐美各國報紙盛傳中日業已簽訂共同防共協定、並將擴充華北日駐軍至北寗·平漢·平綏·三路說、確否、今井答稱、「上述云云、根本為無稽之談、最近以來、外間謠言雖熾、但均無聊之尤、所謂簽訂防共協定說、絕無其事、日本駐屯軍擴充地區說、亦絕對不確、永見參謀長前次返國出席師團長會議、事畢歸任、傳達軍部意向、故予暨松室少將、準備於明晨赴津聽取報吿、張垣特務機關長大木、頃亦應召赴津、予等在津、無多勾留、因二十七日為招魂祭之辰、故期前必趕返北平主持斯典、外傳永見日前已與中國當局晤面說、據予所知、截至二十二日止、永見尚未與中國負責當局會面、總之、中日官民、對防共縱或有談商之必要時、亦母須秘密、外間亦不必揣測其詞、徒淆聽聞、」　　今井繼談至山西剿匪情形時、表示「在初確甚危急、但現已和緩、猶如病人最初危急性症、現已轉為慢性、調理需時、自在意中、至於外交談判、截至現在止、予並無所聞、修築滄石路問題、亦祇見報紙上有此云云、此或為中國鐵路當局前此北來視察時、有此擬議、頃報紙盛載此事已具體化、予殊懷疑此說、未可盡信、津總領川樾茂將昇任中國大使、川樾本人事前並無所聞、何日返國請訓、予尚不知、」最後記者詢禁毒問題、略謂「據聞冀東各縣近因日軍當局之協助、禁毒頗有成績、幾有可一掃而空之勢、但平津最近鮮人開設毒窟、竟見膨脹、武官有何意見、今井沉思有頃、答稱、「取締烈性毒品、予極贊成、冀東各縣毒氛能逐漸肅淸、殊為可喜、平津毒窟之取締、當有必要、惟予意禁賣固必要、禁買亦為要第、希望中日雙方協力進行、始克奏效、而禁買之策、端賴教育與法律相輔而行」、談至此、記者等遂辭出、（二十四日）蔣委員長演講　四川民眾的光明之路（續）　在川省黨部擴大紀念週　　第一、「忠勇為愛國之本」、就是說忠實勇敢的精神道德、是我們愛國的根本要件、我們愛國救國、首先要養成忠勇的精神和德性、同時我們的忠心和勇氣、必須用之於愛國家必須用之於救國家、救同胞、必須為公而不為私、為人而不為己、如一般盜匪殺人越貨愍小畏死、至死不悟、亦是一種勇氣、然而這種勇氣、全是為私為己、所以成為罪惡而不能算為忠勇、所以忠勇的眞義、就是古人所謂「盡忠報國」、所謂「殺身成仁」、所謂　公爾忘私國爾忘家」、所謂　「勇於公戰怯於私鬥」、　　第二、「孝順為齊家之本」、就是我們要使家庭能夠雍容和睦、上下有條有理、整齊一致、造成安樂美滿的家庭、一定先要從孝順父母做起、因為必須盡孝道、然後有尊卑之別、長幼有序、　能使家庭的事頭頭有道、事事有理、有理乃可以發揚光大　　第三、「仁愛為接物之本」所謂接物、是包括對人的交際與對事物的處理而言、我們接物的標準、就是要「仁愛」、卽古人所謂「仁民愛物」、我們要愛同胞、愛朋友以至愛人類、愛宇宙萬物、所謂「民吾同胞物吾與也」、「天地與吾並生萬物與我為一」、就是仁愛的精神、我們本着這種偉大的精神、來待人處事用物、一定可以處處得人之愛、獲人之助、盡物之川、如此自己一分的努力、至少可以發生十分的效果、所有受我們的一切力量、都可以變成我們的力量、更可以增加無數倍的力量、　　第四、「信義為立業之本」、我們要想做出一番事業、一定要得到人家的信仰和幫助、要得到人家的信仰和幫助、一定要自己先有信義、與人交接、先要從事實上表現、我的信仰和道義、使人家相信我們、决不是寡信忘義、自私自利、偷生怕死的人、可以做到的、我們必先有義氣與信仰、然後人家纔會相信我們、我們纔可以成功事業、　　第五、「和平為處世之本」、所謂和平是就人與人的關係而言、「和」就是要互相親愛、不可有忌妬、猜疑、相罵、相打、甚至自相殘殺的事情、「平」就是要彼此公正、不可有侵越、爭奪、欺侮、偏私、損人利已的事情、必須公平、纔能親愛、必須和平、方可處世、個人在社會要以和平待人、凡是我們的同胞、都要相親相愛、凡事寗肯自己吃虧、不可佔人家的便宜、要曉得主張公道保持和平的人、一定可以得到最後的成功、眼前吃小虧的人、到最後一定能佔到便宜、眼前佔小便宜的人、最後一定要吃大虧、凡是我們的同胞、一定要明白這個道理、和平相處、我們第一步要寶現整個國家永遠的和平、成功一個最和平的國家、第二步更要將我們中國的和平貢獻於世界、實現全世界普遍的和平、和平是我們中國固有的美德、我們是永遠主張和平的、但是我們為保持國家生存、和民族的生存、當然要有自衛的能力和决心、如果有外國人要來侵略我們、壓迫我們、這是他來破壞和平、擾亂和平、我們要為保持公道正義、不得不周旋抵抗、以努力求得最後之和平、所以對外在一切和平手段用盡、和平已經絕望的時候、也只能而必須於和平手段之外、更求獨立自存與鞏固和平之道、　　第六、「禮節為治事之本」、這就是我們要辦好事情、一定要注重禮節、因為沒有禮節、無論社會與人事、便沒有秩序、亦不能安定、人與人的關係、更要紛亂、一切事情都無從做起、例如今天在座有一千多人、如果沒有禮節、何能動靜齊一、井然不亂、不必說是多數的羣衆、和團體的紀律、卽使個人的生活和工作也是一樣、古人說「禮者理也、意思就是我們做人做事、要有條理、要有節制、要有正當合理的態度和規矩、我們要做人做事、便隨時隨地要注意禮節、否則不能做人、更不能辦事、所以說「不知禮無以立一」、「禮者事之治也、——君子有其事、必有其治、——無禮則手足無所措、耳目無所加、進退揖讓無所制、田獵戎事失其策、軍旅武功失其制」、本條守則所謂「禮節為治世之本」、也就是這個意思、　　第七、「服從為負責之本」、我們要使國家富強、必須國民人人能負起責任共同努力、這個責任如何負得起來、大家的工作如何、纔能事半功倍呢、最要緊的就橫的關係而言、就是要彼此分工大家合作、就縱的關係來講、就要層層節制、級級服從、例如政府的組織有中央政府、有省政府、縣政府、以至區公所、各級軍隊的人員、有總司令、軍長、師長、以至於士兵各級、都是要由上而下、層層節制、由下而上、級級服從、下級機關或人員、必須服從上級機關或官長的命令、統可以辦好事情　盡到職責、現在我們國家一切事情、不能做好、國家弄到如此危急存亡的地步、就是因為一般人只知爭權奪利、不能負責盡職、個個人都要講自由、講平等不知服從與負責的道理、不曉得人人隨便講自由平等、結果國家民族便要滅亡、不曉得現代國民應當犧牲自己的自由平等來求整個國家的自由平等、今後我們要救國、必須大家負責、負責的根本前提、就是人人要犧牲自己的自由平等服從政府、服從法令、服從長官來盡到自己的職責、政府是國家的機關、法令是國家的意志、長官是政府的代表、所以我們服從長官、不是服從個人、乃是服從他根據國家法律所發的命令、總之我們的服從、是服從國家、是服從職務、就是服從我自己的責任、因為國家是我自己的、職務也是我自己的、這樣服從、亦就是服從我自己本身、如果我能服從我自己、這就呌克己、凡能克己的人、無不成功的、所以我們為國家來服從、而不是服從那一個人、更不是服從私人、所以這種服從是光榮、而不是恥辱、必須如此、才是眞正的服從、才是眞正的負責、才不愧為現代的一個國民、　　第八、「勤儉為服務之本」、天地父母生育我們、社會國家教養我們成一個人、我們一定要為社會國家服務、我們自己是社會國家的一份子、所以為社會國家服務、卽是自己服務、我為人人、卽人人為我、這是自助樂羣的第一要務、必須如此、人生才有意義和價值、我們為社會國家服務、應從何處做起呢、就是要勤勞儉樸、必須勤勞、然後能有貢獻、必須儉樸、然後能有節制、能免消耗、在第一方面、我們克勤克儉的目的、必須是為人羣服務、所以勤儉如果是為私而不為公、所謂「鷄鳴而起、孜孜為利」的那一等人的樣式這種勤儉、於國於民、無所裨益、實非眞正之勤儉、我們要曉得生在現代、沒有整個的社會、整個的民族、和整個的國家、使沒有一般人饑寒、自己一個人可以溫暖、一般人困苦、自己一個人可以安樂的事情、所以必須立定「先憂後樂」的志氣、發揮勞動服務的精神、立人卽所以立己、救人亦所以自救、　　第九、「整潔為治身之本」、所謂治身係兼指內心與身體的修養而言、我們要治身、就要從整潔做起、務必內而專靜純一、淸明在躬、外而整齊嚴肅、潔凈光明、推而至於週遭之事物、生活之環境、都要使能如此、然後能身強體健、品性高尚、智慮精明、一般人不知道整潔的重要、甚至如過去一般名士派、以不整潔自命疏在、謬稱風雅、這種惡習和恥辱、我們應當剷除洗刷、但是我所謂整潔是要澹泊樸素、而與奢侈華麗、是絕對不同的、不是要大家穿顏色的細緞、尤不是要大家來用外國貨、這種是奢侈、奢侈就會要亡國、而且要减種、所以整與儉樸相近、而奢華完全相反、這是附帶補充一點意思、」（未完）譚焯宏案審訊情形　仍須傳證人到案再訊　　上海地方法院推事譚焯宏、興律師楊紹彭、被人向司法行政部密控案、前經由吳縣地方法院檢察處偵查、以凟職罪起訴、二十五日開庭審理、譚延吳超黎冕兩律師、楊延陸鼎揆律師、證人方面、傳孫祖基·朱怡聲·高君湘·李時蕊·（已故）四人、僅朱怡聲高君湘應傳到庭、下午二時五十分開庭、庭長俞鍾、就第三法庭審訊、檢察官朱樹芬、亦蒞庭執行職務、先傳譚焯宏楊紹彭略訊後、檢察官朱樹芬起立述起訴意旨畢、俞庭長論本案庭期甚近、所傳證人不及到齊、先就報到者訊問、先訊擄證人　　朱怡聲供　　三十五歲、上海人、業禪師、民二十二年執行職務、與楊紹彭向不認識、大概在前年已紀不淸楚、與譚焯宏不相識、官論朱處證人地位、命具結、朱又供、關於海州輪船船主秦錚如過失致人死一案、大通公司茶房找船大副吳志寬說、此案如不出錢、要判三年徒刑、這是秦錚如同我說的、說明尚未判决、我並未理他、關於雷允上吿訴王炳南偽造商標一案、我係民訴代理人、案為譚焯宏審理的、第一庭王炳南交保、嗣楊紹彭到我事務所、說秦錚如案、譚推事叫你不要放在心上、種種是姓龔的不好、現在雷允上案、譚推事說、如果出幾個錢、可以辦得滿意、我即回絕他、也沒有問他與譚推事有何關係、嗣後楊又打電話來、說出一千元可矣、我又拒絕、第一次索二千元、我因為不信法院有這種事、所以不多問、在辯論終結、又打電話來、說給你最後一次機會、至少出四百元可了、我未允、此事曾與雷允上作不詳細的說過、我並不認識姓龔的、與譚及楊、並無過不意處、　　高君湘供　　三十六歲、金山人、住上海、業律師、與楊紹彭向認識、自小同學、但並不來往、與他亦無惡感、關於吳佩珍自訴李克庭案、我為辯護人、該案結果、刑庭不受理、先是譚焯宏推事辦的、後來什麼人辦不知道、我出庭過一次、是第二次開庭、在十日裏、結果、被吿交一千元保、我即要求代以舖保、但當天因天晚不及找保、第二天找到了保、忽譚推事傳保人去、後來家屬打電話給我、說譚推事對保人稱、須担負一萬元責任、因此保人不肯保了、我很奇怪、即到法院問譚推事怎樣一回事、譚推事說、明天再說、那時家屬即另去請陸律師加人辦理、下一天、楊紹彭來說、對此案有何意見、我說並無、是時陸律師適到、陸律師即說此案根本不應受理、不應覊押、太笑話、楊紹彭聽了、沒有說話、即走了、當時楊並沒有打電話給譚推事、但聞楊說他去同譚推事說、其他並無投話、　　楊紹彭從　　與譚焯宏是陳漢石陳宗甫去年春在上海介紹我認識的、譚很崇拜章十釗道德文章、託由陳漢石轉託我介紹投章門下、章

救中華？曰：生產，曰：團結，曰：國防，而前二者尤為在本。吾校旣以生產為目的矣，還當着重團結，團結從何處起？從吾校友起，從吾校友會起；如何團結，曰：一，須有堅强之組織，二，須無一分子皆活動，三，須各個分子為同方向之活動，以構成整個之活動；諸同學其各依此提出辦法！　廿五，三，卅一，黃炎培成都紀念文（二）  江問漁　　聯絡情誼，硏究學術，砥礪品行，這是目前最重要的三件事，也就是　諸君設會的本旨。我以為為根本做人計，固然要努力做這三件事，為目前救亡圖存計，更要努力做這三件事。試問，我們所託命的國家民族，已經危險到這樣地步，我們除去劍及履及的趕快幹救亡圖存工作外，其他那裏有話可說？直接了當的說罷，救亡圖存，是我們一切工作的總目標；而聯絡情誼，硏究學術，砥礪品行，便是達到這個目標的最好訪求，再進一層說，團結，生產，新生，便是這三句話的註解。因為聯絡情誼，是為的團結；硏究學術，是為的生產；砥礪品行，是為的犧牲，當然團結，生產，犧牲，是救亡圖存的根本要道。　　中華職業學校校友會十週紀念，發行特刋，書此奉贈，並願與　諸君共勉！　　丙子四月江恒源紀念文（三）  楊衛玉　　國家到今日，可說是「存亡俄傾」關頭了，所謂國難嚴重，還不够形容他的危險。同時看看社地的現狀，可以說，文人常用的不祥名詞，如金融緊縮，實業不振，工商凋敝等等，無一不具，所謂不景氣者，也不够形容他的衰落。我們生在這個時代，食毛踐土，究竟是一個中國國民。假使尙有人心，眼看着國家社會到此絕境，終沒有束手待斃，或甘心做奴隸的吧！我們終要想一個絕處逢生的辦法，終要想共同打出一條生路。那末；惟有各人拿出良心和能力來，貢獻大衆，就是貢獻國家社會。　　我向來不喜唱高調，高調徒快人意，實際沒有絲毫益處。向來不作驚人之筆，驚從之筆，不過自己沽名釣譽，於大衆也許有損無益。所以我不必說：『民衆們一致武裝起來，抵抗敵人』。也不必說「大家臥薪嘗膽，共赴國難。」老實說，這許多話，事產上也未必做得到的。我的希望很小。論調很低。我以為只要個個國民，或者大多數的國民，尤其是靑年。能把人類應做的事，都做起來，不應做的事，都不做。社會不患不振作，國難不患不解除。國家社會，本來是有機體的組織，國民就是組織的分子，國家社會的危險衰落，不是本身的，就是分子構成的，反正：分子健全，國家社會那有不健全的道理？一個有機體分子，只要不是腐爛死滅，無論大小組細，都有同樣的貢獻。一部機器的作用，發生效力的地方，不一定在大機件，一隻小螺絲釘，也很有關係，這是人人都知道的。把牠比喩國家和國民，何嘗不是這樣呢？　　我們中華職業學校，成立將二有志于此年，校方友會也成立了十年了。校友之散在四方各界工作的不下兩千人，當然內中的地位的能力，機遇，學識等等，不是一律的。但是我深信，無論那位校友，除了千分之一二死亡腐滅以外，絕大多數，人人有業，人人樂業，不但樂業，而且樂羣。人人用其所學，孜孜於其所業，這就是我們對於人類國家社會的最大貢獻。我不是為中華職校校友吹牛，更用不着對校友會馬。假使我中華三十年來受過新敎育的人們，個個都像這般校友，人人有一技之彽，努力工作，至少可以不負貽誤國家之責，也許國家不會到此地步，這就是我們的貢獻。雖然；事急矣，國難深矣，大多數的靑年也許還沒有貢獻的機會，我們格外努力吧！國家的前途，正期待我們做開路先鋒呢！紀念文（四）  潘文安　　中華職業學校成立將及二十年，而校友會所之建立，於今恰為十周，校友會諸君子，念締造之艱難，謀維持之恒久，僉主以紀念之而徵言於予。予為之擇言曰：天下事作始也簡，將畢也鉅，當予服務職校時，以在校同學之少肴縮食，日積而月累，使自治會之經濟，臻於充裕之地步，為校友會謀永久之基，已屬難能而可貴。而畢業校友中，如王君佐才，張君立顏及故錢君國琪等之努力王成，不辭劬勞，尤使予感佩難忘。惟是創造固難，守成亦不易，數年來校友會諸委員，辛苦艱難，力予維持，俾本會事業，不特賴以不　，且有發揮光大之勢，此種勇於服務之精神，尤足令千百餘之校友，同聲贊歎而感不絕於懷。明歲，創辦，俾吾校之事業，更發揚而廣大，與黃先生以同壽疆，此意吾校友巳有動議，敢於此次紀念時重為提出，以誌吾校友，相與商兌而準備之，則尤所企幸也。通吿（一）　　本會定於今日（四月二十六日）下午一時，假座上海南京路大陸商塲七樓正誼社，舉行十週紀念慶祝大會，祇以籌備匆促，加之校友雲蹤靡定，未能調查周至，通吿函件寄遞為難，遺漏之咎，自所難辭；用將開會順序，刋功於后，敬希　公鑒，至盼出席。　　（一）舉行慶祝式　下午一時起　（二）校友游藝　下午四時起　（三）聚餐　下午七時通吿（二）　　本會成立十週紀念刋，業已出版，即在慶祝大會會塲分發，凡我校友之旅居外埠或本日不克出席者，請函本會索閱可也。通吿（三）　　本會季刋向由張企翁校友主編，嗣因集稿困難，遂致中輟，茲由楊崇景張企翁兩校友負責復刋，統此奉吿。通吿（四）　　本會成立於今十載，校友數將二千，祇因於役四方，殊少聚集機會，尤其校友住址靡定，通訊為難，務請將最近通訊處或永久通訊處見示，以便隨時接洽一切</p>

<p>申報兒童專刊讀活書  謝澐　　小朋友！現在春光明媚，又是你們快樂旅行的待候了，你門從「狹的籠」中的學校，走到這大自然的學校，千廳百怪的現象，會使你們應接不暇，這是你們讀活書的大自然學咬。什麽是活書？生活！小朋友你們不要忘記敎育你們自己，要常常從你們的生活中去求智識，學校和書籍，先生不過是帮助你們的指導者，最後還是需要你們自己努力工作，才可以求得眞正的知識，天底下，地上頭，那裏不是書，你們無論是看到一株草木，或是一隻禽獸，都得要詳細的觀察，認眞的研究，都可以得到一切有用的智識，你們的眼睛是要常常去觀察，你們的心腦，是要常常的去思想！為甚麽瓦特往意沸水的壺蓋，能發明蒸汽機；牛頓往意蘋果落地，能發明萬有引律的定理？他們都是能讀活書，才能發明這樣有用的新事物。小朋友你能絕對不要專讀白紙黑字的書，你們還得讀活書，才可以得到眞正有用的智識，才可以像瓦特牛頓一樣的去發明新事物。把鬍鬚藏在袖管裏  教書匠　　專制時代，一做了大官，便搭起架子來，一切行動都要裝腔做勢，作威作福。却把一身自由自在的風趣，全至喪失掉了。但一等精明强幹的好脚色，决不肯拋棄自身的本來面目。於是公餘之暇，便私自微行，考察社會眞實情形，免被屬下所蒙蔽。　　曾國荃做兩江總督的時侯，年紀已經六十多歲了。常常打扮着鄕下人樣子到各處去遊玩。有一次，呌他的慕友穿了平常布衣；他自己戴了一頂毡帽，着一件大袖子的短襖，在半夜裏走出南京城，登獅子山，一直走到下關的軍營裏看看。營裏的兵將都睡着了。池們走到廚房裏，吃了些瓜果解渴。再走到碼頭上賞月。　　恰巧上水輪船開過來，他們倆便裝做普通旅客，搭了輸船到漢口。小客棧裏住了兩天，又渡江到武昌。適値兩湖總督張之洞舉行閱兵典禮，大將登壇，煞是威風凛凛。曾國荃也雜在人衆中一旁觀看。只因為他鬍鬚甚長，便把一隻手支往下頦，把鬍鬚納在袖子管裏，免被識者看破。玩了一個暢快，依舊不聲不響地回到南京。　　你想他這樣一個大官，何等從容機警而饒有風趣呵！皮球和熱水瓶  陳鐵吾　　小皮球，　　眞正好，　　拍一拍，　　跳幾跳，　　拍得重，　　跳得高　　不像我們中國人，　　受人家鞭撻不違拗。　　熱水瓶，　　實在好，　　經過許多時，　　溫水依舊冷不掉，　　不像我國中國人，　　只消五分鐘，　　滿腔熱度便完了。浮和沉  真　　星期日的那天，敏兒獨自在溫書，他先溫習自然，讀到了潛水艇的一課。除了書本上所吿訴他的以外，他更發生了書本外的疑問。他一有了疑問，自己想不出，便去問他的爸爸和哥哥，一些兒不藏在腦裏，直問到明明白白的時候才罷，所以他的學問進步得很快，而他的爸爸和哥哥也很願意回答他。　　「哥哥，潛水艇是很大的船隻，它怎能浮上沉下，可以隨人家的意思？」　　「潛水艇的裏面，不是有氣槽的嗎？氣槽裏是放滿了很多的空氣。如果要使艇沉下，那麽把唧筒去壓水，使它到氣槽裏。那知道空氣有一種壓縮性，把很多的空氣，變成極水的體積，水一進去，空氣便被水壓縮，於是艇身裏又加重了一部分水的重量，所以艇身便漸漸的沉下。假使要它浮上，那麽放開氣槽口，使水流出來，而當時壓縮的空氣有一種擴張的力，把水壓出去，艇身重了，便又浮到水面。」　　「我不十分明瞭，哥哥，你可能再解釋一下吧？」　　「不明暸嗎？好，我吿訴你一種極淺顯的事情：鯽魚，你總看見過，它能從水底裏浮上，再從水面上沉下去，你可看見過沒有？他怎麽會浮上沉下，和潛水艇是一樣的道理。它的肚子裏有一種魚鰾？這鰾分做前室和後室。它如果要浮起到水面，於是它把魚鰾裏的水吐出來，魚鰾裏的空氣膨脹，魚身臧輕，便浮起來。假使要沉下，就多吃些水到魚鰾裏，魚身加重而沉下。」　　「哥哥，它如果要把魚頭浮起而魚尾沉下，那麽怎樣呢？」　　「它要魚頭浮起，魚尾沉下，只要把魚鰾的後室多加水，前室不使有水，於是前室比後室輕，因此魚頭浮起而魚尾沉下。反之，那麽魚尾便浮起而魚尾沉下了。」簡便的飛鏢  百宜　　小朋友，我想你們也許很久就想做一隻飛鏢吧？現在讓我來吿訴你門一個做簡便的飛鏢的方法；先取一隻稍大的橄欖技，把兩個尖頭磨平，至兩端各現出小洞數個為止。（磨至一定時候，定有小洞出現）。於是取長大的鷄毛二銀至三根，酌量插於一端的洞內；再取鋼針一枚插於另一端的洞內，至穩當不易脫出為適度，這樣，一雙簡便而好玩的小飛鏢便做成了，你只要很輕的一擲它便可很穩的釘住在木版上或共他質料鬆疏的東西上了。　　於是，你便可約好幾個朋友，來比賽誰向　目　上擲鏢得分最多而决勝負。更可分成兩個團體來比賽，又可任意想出新花樣來玩。可是，你得留心，千萬別對着人來這麽下：「照鏢」！科學常識氣透不過來的原因  張亦菴　　大家都知道空氣對於人的重要吧。三兩天不吃東西不算怎麽一回事，可是十分鐘不呼吸，性就會喪失。為什麽！因需我們每一秒鐘都需要空氣裏的養氣營養。如果停止了養氣的供給，表們的血液在身體裏便會停上了流動，心房失了作用，生命便會危險。　　我們動作，行走的時候是要運用肌肉的。肌肉當運用的時候，便需要更多的血和養氣的營養；越是運動急劇，則所需的血氣營養越多，因此我們的呼吸也更加急速起來，心房的跳動也加速了（閃為心房是運轉血液的總機關）。　　有時運動的急劇程度過甚，你的呼吸的速度趕不上供給肌肉所需要的營養時，你便會有酸痛，疲倦的感覺，同時呼吸也　得邊不過來。心臟弱的人，如果勉强作劇烈的運動，那末心房的動作太速了，速到他的心房担當不起的程度時也會有送掉性命的危險。　　在運動會塲或球賽場中往往看見有些小朋友為着要爭取錦標，勉强去做着他力不能當的運動，那眞是令人揑一把汗的。運動成績的優劣，全在乎平日練習之有恒與及得法，斷不是十天八天之內可以速成，更不是一鼓可以取勝的，即使勝了，對於身體不但無益，而且會有害。謹愼的學校是要先請高明的醫生先行將學生的體格加以檢騐，然後才認定他可以學會某項運動。連續故事（上）  友鑑　　仍舊屬於我的！　　　肥兒搶去榮兒的一袋菓子，便急忙逃走。　　　他想逃到對岸去。　　　不料第四塊石塊是一隻大鳥龜。　　　烏龜仍向這邊游過來，肥兒祇好把一袋菓子還給了他，榮兒笑着說：「好！仍舊屬於我的！」書包不要放在學校裏  玉樹　　小朋友們時常因為貪圖來去便利，把書包鎖在學校中的檯桌裏。這是一個壞習慣。　　我們讀書，單在校裏受課幾小時是不够的，所有的功課，必需回家去溫習，自修。把書包放在校裏，假如把你所有的書都放在書包裹，那末晚上你在家裏讀些什麽？卽或你把一部份的書放在書包裏，要知道校裏課程是每天有更換的，第二天需要的時候你仍得拿去，否則，一定要在上課時侯嚷着忘記帶書了！　　　　一個書包，拿在手裏，並沒什麽不便，放在校裏，反多麻煩。小朋友們定不少犯着這壞習慣的，應當從今天起，改革掉，而學校和家庭裏，遇到這樣情形，應設法糾正他！本刋補獎啟事　　郭成志，權興，梅憑璋，儲思勤，尹德堅，韓蘊，張炳生，趙寶泉，潘雲生，諧君鑒：本館前寄見童徵文獎品，均因無從投遞，業已陸續退回。茲請開明詳細通信地址，並親筆來信證明，以便核對筆跡，補寄獎品為要。　　申報兒童專刋部啟新中國的小英雄  蒙遜　　小英雄，　　志氣好！　　你拿槍，　　我揮刀；　　坦克車，　　小鋼砲；　　還有勇敢　　小小狗。　　身掛藥箱　　跟着跑！　　軍號吹，　　國族飄；　　前有敵。　　上刺刀；　　一，二、三　　衝上去！　　殺得敵人哇哇呌，背轉身子向後逃！電鈴  經田　　諸位小朋友！你們大約都看見過電鈴；但是你們知道為什麽把裝在門外的一個圓形小木匣（圖一）中凸起的釦一撳，同葉門內的錐便響起來了　　今天我就同諸位小月友來討論這個問題。　　（下圖橫看，格子勿要）啚一啚二　　電鈴是電磁石（註一）最簡單的應用，它的構造如圖一。　　圖中的A是電磁石，B是鈴，C是軟鐵片，D是彈條，附在軟鐵片上，E是錘，一端連軟鐵片，F是釘，G，H是二金屬片，I是電池，P是釦。　　我在門外把釦撳下，是二金屬片互相接觸，電流卽通過電磁石，電磁石卽發生磁性，於是引吸前面的軟鐵片，錘卽聲鈴作聲一次：同時將彈條和釘的接觸點分開，電流中斷，電磁石失去他的磁性，軟鐵片因彈力作用，恢複原來位置，彈條再和釘接觸，電路又通，錘再擊鈴；因為彈條彈回和電路再通所費的時間，極短，我們不易聽出：所以釦欺不放，鈴聲亦不斷絕。　　註：將漆包綫，紗包綫等覆被導綫，在生鐵棒上，盤成縲旋形，二端通以電流，於是生鐵棒因誘導作用變成磁石。我將來做怎樣的人  南京市立徐家巷小學王德全　　（第十三名）　　現在世界列强，因為他們的科學發達，生產過剩，不但本國人　用，而且可以推銷國外。吸收他國的金錢，若是一個科學落伍的國家，在這種弱肉强食的時代，絕對沒有他獨立存在的地位。　　我國是東亞文明的古國，而且是被壓迫被侵略的國家，也是科學落後的國家。一部分民衆，對於科學方面，不肯虛心研究，一切的生產物，都靠勞力，所以出產物很少，價値很貴，時間又不經濟。貨物不够人民應用，必得向外國講買　因此，把金錢大批流出國外，使得國內民窮財盡，內憂外患，民不聊生。甚麽都被壓迫，土地又逐漸喪失，人民常遭災難。道都是科學落後的緣故。假使長此以往，再不趕緊補救，不獨失地不能恢復，就連國家民族恐怕亦難保存了。　　我抱著很遠大很樂規的志願，希望將來做一個有名的科學家。以求發明科學，促進中國社會的進步。我以為科學與國家，有密切關係。現在只有科學能挽救中國。我抱着這决定的志願，在求學時代，養成研究科學的習慣，探討科學原理。希圖有所發明。並且把我的科學思想，敎授民衆，使得全國民衆，個個有科學常識，造成一個科學的國家。恢復人民的幸福，振興國家的工業，收回國家的失地，這樣國家得不亡，歷來的國恥，亦得洗雪乾凈。義狗傳（十六）  心靑　　（三）　　這夜，老達士躺在壁角裏的牀林上，開口說道：「今天是小愛洛的命名曰，可不是麽？」　　小南洛做了個手勢，答應他老祖父的問話，他很願老人家忘懷了這件事情，不再提起。老達士偏又說道；「為甚麽不到伊家去啊？南洛，以前你是年年去慣了的。」　　小南洛低下頭去，凑在他老祖父的牀上低低的說道：「你老人家病得這樣，我不能離開你。」　　老達士忙進；「不必！不必！伏萊德嬤嬤會來伴我的，以前巳有過好多次了。南洛，你到底為什麽不去？你難道和那外竇貝口角了不成？」　　小南洛的臉上熱辣辣地漲得通紅，忙不迭的答道：「沒有，祖父——沒有這回事，實實在在為的是柯廿士先生今年並沒有邀請我。他似乎有不滿於我的意思。」　　「但你可曾做錯了甚麽事情沒有？」　　「一些兒沒有。我不過在松板上給小愛洛畫了一個像罷了。」　　「唉！」老達士嘆息了一聲，便默默的不作聲了，原來那孩子的回話，巳使他明白了一切。他雖是躺在小屋的壁角裏那張草床上，然而他還沒有忘却外面的世故人情。他把小南洛的頭抱在他的懷中，現山一種很慈愛的神情。　　他抖顫了一下，顫聲說道：「我的孩子，你是太窮了！太窮了！這使你何等的難受！」　　小南洛低聲說道：不，不，我並不窮，我實在是很富的。原來他暗暗地想自己有着作晝的天才，他的富力簡直超出帝土之上。當下他走到門口，在那靜靜的一片夜色中站住了，眼望着天空中無數的明星和那在風中顫動的白楊。　　磨坊中所有的房聞都是燈火通明，時時有笛子的聲音從風中吹送過來，一滴滴的眼淚從小南洛的面頰上滴下，然而一　時間就換上了一副笑容，一面對自己說道：「且等着將來吧！」他在門口勾留了好久，直等到夜色巳深，四下裏都寂靜了，方才和柏德希回進屋中，－同躺下來睡了。　　　小南洛有一個秘密，只有柏德希是知道的。在那小屋的旁邊，另有一間套房，平日間只有他一人進去，這是一個很僻靜的所在，但是有很充足的天光，從北面射入，這裏就算是他的畫室了。他用一片粗粗的木片，作為畫板，又張很大的白張，以供作畫之用，凡是他腦中所留着的印象，都一一畫在上面。　　關於作畫的方法從來料加工沒有人敎過他，他也沒有甚麽錢可買顏料，有時他連麵包也吃不到，所以他的畫上從不着色，不過是黑白二色罷了。他用鉛粉畫了一個很大的人像；一個老人坐在一株倒下的樹上，因為他在黃昏時候，曾見那老樵夫來吉爾總是坐在那裏的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊副刋新聞中國女子生產合作社門市部籌備經過  方範女士　　筆者前幾天見報上揭載中國女子生產合作社行將開幕的消息，即驅車往訪該社經理胡英女士，探詢其中情形，當蒙詳吿一切。預料是項新聞必為社會人士所注目，因商得胡女士之同意，發表其談話如下：　　「女士現在很忙吧？」　　「現在尚無十分重要工作，先生有話就請賜教。」　　「貴社自創辦至今，大概已有好幾年了吧？女士們這樣為社會努力，實在不勝欽佩！」　　「不敢！不敢！這是我們應盡的義務，不過我們不大會辦事，還希望各界人士多多指導。至於本社過去歷史是這樣的：因為常常有許多失業女子到中華婦女節制協會裹來請求救濟，本會主任劉王立明女士感到目前社會不景氣的深刻化，如果沒有比較切實的辦法，也就無從救濟起，所以在去春發起組織中國汝子生產合作社，領導她們把各人自己的能力來救濟自己。一年以來，成績也還不錯，現在覺得這個組織應有擴大而謀普及的必要，因此通過董事會，並推定幾位同志，草草的籌備起來。」　　「那末貴社的宗旨以及營業性質和範圍又怎樣呢？」　　「我們感到男女不平等的癥結，主要的還是在於女子經濟能力的薄弱，有許多女同胞並不是一定低能，不過因為她們無論在那一方面都很少出路，而同時她們所生產的出品，為着種種原因，又不能暢銷遐邇，和資本主義襲斷殖民地的市場一樣，一切市場都為男子所壟斷了，所以女子只得理沒了固有的能力，而做了男子們的分利者或犧牲品。現在本社的宗旨，除書畫部為發揚女子文化藝術外，就是要帮助一般勞苦的女同胞推售她們的出品，使其能暢銷於市場，不再受中間階層的剝削，以提高女子生產，促進她們經濟的獨立。至於營業範圍，現在暫分三部。　書晝部，所經售的都是中國的女畫家和女作家的出品，惟書的範圍較廣，蓋因許多關於婦女和家庭問題者，亦應搜集，以供讀者的需要。　食品部，飲食和衛生有不可分離的關係，況調製食品亦為女子技能之一種，所以就把牠列為一部。　工藝部，工藝在中國本來是很有歷史的，自從歐風東漸，人們既重視機器出品，就不免忽視了手工藝術，但科學誠然萬能，而人工亦具有固有的優點，因此本社亦把牠作為基本部份。自前暫限於以一上三部，好在隨時得加以一擴充，只要是女子的出品，都可以由本社代售的，不過這純粹是合作性質，售出之資只提出極小部份作為本社的手續費。」該社經理兼書畫部主任胡英女士　　「貴社籌備的經過和今後的方針可以見吿否？」　　「可以的，自從經董事會議决添設門市部以來，當卽贊定圓明園路二〇五號新建西式店面一所，現正在裝修中，並推定各負責人員，着手進行一切，因為我們這裏旣分為三部份，各部就得設主任一人，規劃一切。現在草創伊始，事務總還簡單，所以，書盡部主任一職暫由鄙人兼任。凡關於該部的出品，「畫」業已徵得中國女子書畫會馮文鳳，陳小翠，楊雪玖，李秋君，吳靑霞，余靜芝，顧靑瑤，周練霞，徐冷翠，金秋生等幾位女士的同意，允將得意之作供應給本社：「書」亦商得女子書店，北新書局，中華書屆，商務印書館，生活書店等各大書局將冰心，丁玲，廬隱，謝冰瑩，俞慶棠，沈茲九等各著名女作家的作品該社發起人劉王立明女士</p>

<p>，並關於婦女及家庭問題的著作，供應給本社，還有劉王立明女士自已的一本文藝創作「生命的波濤」亦將出版問世；以上各位女士的精心偉構，久已風行海內，殊用不着我來介紹。工藝部主任是張學海女士，這一部的物品包括刺繡製造等各手工出品，除女子家事高級職業學校，及婦孺教育院担任一部份外，其餘已向北平紹興等各方面分頭接洽。食品部主任則由吳淑卿女土担任，關於這一部的出品，以中西茶點為重心，那可完全是　　家事學校的成績。其餘還有幾位職員，共同襄理。不過我們都是以服務社會為天職，所以是沒有薪水的，除非本社有盈餘，除去開支及辦慈善事業之外，大家纔得平均分配，不過現在還須添聘能操流利英語，稍諳簿記的女職員一位，如有這樣人才而又有興趣服務社會的，可以詳述自己的所長，寫信到我這裏—華龍路元昌里十四號—來接洽。至於今後的方針，實在也沒有什麼可以奉吿，不過在目前我們女子或多或少的總是處在雙層或甚至三層壓迫下面，這是無席諱言的，關於女子的一切事業現在還完全在萌芽時代，擁護的固然多，存心摧殘的也决不會少，深願羣策羣力，能夠由上海為出發點，慢慢的推行到全國去。我們明知在現在經濟恐慌時代，一切事業都不容易辦得好，但你若不能與惡劣環境相搏戰，去克復一切困難，那你便更沒有生路了。」　　「女士交際廣闊，担任經理一職當然勝任愉快，女土的履歷和私生活也肯宣布一些嗎？」　　「我這次謬膺這個重任，實在慚愧得很，雖則經婦女節制恊會中西各董事議决委我担任，然而我總覺得通去學校生活過得太久，自己委實還是　學生而不是個商人，雖然自從離開北大以後，在政界服務了一年多，後來又在教育界和商界奔走了七八年，但根據過去的經騐，作一番自我的批評，恐怕不能勝任，幸得各界友朋的鼓勵和贊助，又有這許多同志的帮忙，單就這裹張吳二位女士的精明幹練來說，已足為我的好幫手了，所以就勉效棉薄，不然或許難免限越呢。至於私生活，實在太簡單，除了每天晚上往量才補習學校讀一點日文外，沒有什麼可以報吿，並且前天女子月刋社已派人來訪問我過，為避免重複起見，不再說罷。說到交際廣闊，那可根本不敢當，我自從踏上社會纔小到十年，所認識的軍警政商學各界人士也不過幾千人，至於在社會上比較有地位的則僅幾百人而已，那裹夠得上交際兩個字。」　　「聽說女士也是唐冠玉女士　所發起的　國女子書　會的會員，將來貴社開幕的時候，大作想亦不少吧？」　　「見笑得很，雖然有。幅署欵胡　馨的就是拙作，但　向沒有時間去練習，僅僅是暇時的一種消遺，記得三年前承謝无量，陳立廷，徐悲鴻，章士釗等諸位先生為我訂了一個潤例，可是與各界酬應的大小書件至今恐還小滿百幅，眞是生疏得很，將來還希海　各大方家多多指教。」時事硏究貌合神離的英法關係  召琪　　英法兩國都是國際聯盟的主要支持者，倫敦和巴黎的外交家向來都是挾日內瓦以自利的，在這點上可說它們並沒有衝突。但戰後的英國外交，主要的是在努力維持歐洲之均勢，以保存不　顚帝國在歐洲的固有的地位，並維持它在非洲和亞洲的殖民地的權利；而去蘭西的外交視綫則是集中在萊茵河對岸，集中在柏林的；因此，英法兩國的外交政策雖同以國聯為基點，但它們各自的目標卻根本不相同，以致使倫敦與巴黎的意志在根本上就不易結合。　　最近因為莫索里尼遠征來非，企圖獨吞阿比西尼亞，使英人感到非洲殖民地受着威脅，地中海上原有的勢力為之動　，所以，當意阿開火的消息傳出後，英國馬上就在日內瓦大聲疾呼，實行對意制裁。法國既然也同是國聯的支持者，當然不便公然離開日內瓦，明白贊助意大利的侵略行為；但為了防禦德國，法意曾簽定了羅馬協定，在巴黎外交家的內心中自然也不願拋開自己這個新的友好，為人作嫁，而眼隨在英人之後，以對付意大利；因此，在矛盾中，法國對意阿問題便採取了緩和的企圖兩全的態度。它一面和英國在日內瓦不斷談判，表面尊重國聯盟約，一面父向羅馬暗送秋波，表示它不願積極實行制裁。這樣一來，當然會使英帝國主義大為不快，但除了不快之外，一時也並沒有積極的對付辦法；而且，因為另外沒有好的友伴，還不得不裝着笑臉繼續與馬巴黎交談，夢想英法關係能在一致對意下和好起來。　　同時，正在英意衝突尖銳，英法不能一致的時候，霹靂一聲，在上月七日希特勒突然宜布廢除諾加羅公的，進兵萊茵河地帶，並提出意見六點，以作國際和平談判之基礎。他的藉口是法國與蘇聯訂立互助公的，已經是違反了諾加羅條的的精神，所以這條的可無須遵守，而德軍開入萊茵區是正當的。這對於法國簡直是一種公然進攻的挑戰行為。因此，法人對於希特勒這種毀的行為的回答，除了調集軍隊開往邊境布防外，也就跑到日內瓦去高呼萊茵河畔的危機，要求諾加羅公的簽的國和國聯制裁德國。但這時侵阿的意軍已進到查那湖地域了，英國正睜着眼注視它在尼羅河上的權利，對於法國要求的答覆則是要它更注意東菲的戰爭，說東非問題未解决以前，歐洲安全無法維持。當法國和平方案提出時，柏林方面認為是「高聳雲宵之大廈」，日內瓦認為是「幻想的野心的，莫可實施的」，倫敦的態度也是非常冷淡。本月十八日英首相鮑爾溫在華塞特發表演說，除猛烈攻擊意大利外，更公然謂希特勒有「撥開全歐陰霾之最大權力。」這種情形當然是法國所大不高興的。但為了對付德國，為了不致使英人公然扶助希將勒的毀約行為，它仍不得不繼續與倫敦談判，要求英國的軍事援助。雖然英法乃至比利時的外交家和參謀部為了萊茵河畔問題的不斷談判，並沒有商討出有效的辦法，但外交談判仍是要進行的，因為他們雖然各有懷抱，在目前情形下雖然合不起來，但彼此卻也不願一下就分手的。　　因為芙法關係的貌合神離，莫索里尼和希特勒這兩大野心家當然更可大瞻地在他們的胃險途徑上賽跑了。事實上，因為有法國在日內瓦緩和制裁空氣，侵阿意軍不僅不停止進攻，而且不顧一切地使用毒瓦斯，以毒殺手無寸鐵的阿國人民。現在意軍已佔領台西，進逼阿京了，尼羅河上的英闕權利巳感到了更現實的威脅，英意衝突已發展到了更直接的情勢，但這除使大英帝國的神經緊張外，巴黎方面對這種情形仍是保持其安閑態度。在另一方面，希特勒在造成了德軍開入萊茵河畔的事實後，更進而在那里努力建設防防御工程，並表示將收回已失的殖民地；同時還提出了許多新的建議，新的問題，以投台倫敦的希求，企圖將西歐的視綫轉向東歐去。道種表現當然不會移　英國注視尼羅河的視綫，但對於巴黎卻算忍無可忍受的進攻。所以，法國在英人優容希特勒的毀約行為下，最近甚至有單獨自由行動的表示。目前日內瓦對於尼羅河與萊茵河的問題都非常注意，但這注意力一是來自倫敦，一是來自巴黎。因此，在目前日內瓦也就有兩種制裁的呼聲：一是加緊制裁意大早，一是實行制裁德國。主張前者的不消說是英國，但法國卻在從中緩和，反之，主張後者的是法國，但英國卻在勸巴黎的政治家不要「意氣用事」。　　據本月二十一日報載，艾登彭古談話結果，英法已相互讓步，成立妥協。在這妥協中，艾登所得的是：「　法國務勿意氣用事，循至一怒面退出國聯，蓋國聯會雖無力解决萊茵河問題，但法國苟與國聯會絕裾，則尼難河問題將愈感棘手也。　法國對於現行各項對意制裁辦法，務勿取消，其於國聯會盟約亦當癢續信守之。　關於萊茵河問題，英國當與德國進行談判，俾將德法兩國所提之和平計劃同時加以考慮；但為國務當假以時日，俾英國得以從容進行。「至於彭古所得的，則是。「　出行各項對意制裁辦法雖可予以維持，但不必再事加緊。　英國對於萊茵河事件，與意阿爭端務當一視同仁，母得軒輊，以免增長德國之氣燄，血致再作破壞條約之舉動，而意國亦不致快快觖望，則以　國對於歐洲集體安全組織，刻已準備重行參加也。　關於意阿爭端，英法兩國政府務當精誠合作，以覓求和平解决方案。」這樣的所謂妥協，在表面上雖然表現出了英法兩國相互的關心，所謂「友善精神」，但在實際上法國並未拋開意大利，積極幫助英國；同樣，英國也未放棄優容希特勒的態度，與法國站在一邊堅决施行國際條約的義務。事實上，就在這項所謂妥協成立後的第一天，在國聯行政院會議中英法代表的意見也有顯著的不一致，囚而使國聯的結構露出「裂痕」。據艾登的演說，則是意大利違反國聯盟約，應該一致對付；但彭古則謂要對付歐洲方面之威脅，必須意國通力合作。—這種表現已經充分說明了所謂英法的妥恊只是到某種程度為止的，而且是表面的；倫敦與巴黎的精神，到現在為止，都還談不到一致。　　但是，在這樣貌合神離的英法關係下，第一必會使德意更大膽地向危險道上邁進，因而引起英意以及法德的衝突史加尖銳。現在，意軍已佔領了界在英埃蘇丹的高伯拉等地域，與英國駐在該處的陸空軍遙遙相對，因之英意的武裝衝突大有一觸即發之勢。至於德法的關係，雖不一定有很决爆發戰爭的可能，但在英國的優容和鼓勵之下，希特勒的不斷冒險行動隨時都有可能點燃歐洲的火綫的。其次，由於英法的不能一致，國際聯盟今後將更要成為不能解决問題的無用機關，歐洲乃至世界局勢將要更加混亂。　　同時，繼德國宣布廢除諾加羅公約之後的，還有　匈的軍備重整　擴充，土耳其的恢復海峽軍備，這些都足以使歐洲局勢更加緊張和混亂的。單就現在英法德意四大國間之關係及這裹所舉出的新的事件看來，我們就很担心和　之神的壽命是要能維持到一九三七年了！介紹「結婚指導」　　「飲食男女，人之大欲。」「男女居室，人之大倫。」所以男女結婚，為人生應做的事。但是社會上為什麼常常發生一種不安現象呢？像早婚·晚婚·私婚·逃婚·離婚·重婚·失戀自殺·三角戀愛等等事情，這都是沒有人來公開講過。學校裏沒有專門科目，學術團體少公開講演，父母不多指導。現在好了，有劉麟生瞿紹伊等七位專家合著了一本「結婚指導」，從各方面來指導結婚，凡男女靑年均應人手一編。該書由上海四馬路二七七號動奮書局出版，定價每冊七角，特價四角，以一月為限云。碎錦凱羅紀伯倫（Kahlil　Gibran）嘉言綠  劉楊朱　　在你不安於你的思想的時候，你就說話，在你不能再在你心的孤寂中生活的時候，你就要在你的唇上生活，而聲音是一種消遣，一種娛樂，在你許多的談話裏，思想半受殘害。—談話　　我能談你們的善性，卻不能談惡性。因為什麼是惡，不只是靑被他自身的飢渴所困苦麼？的確底，有善飢餓的時候，他肯向黑暗中覓食，渴的時候他也肯喝死水。—談善惡　　常常在你拒絕逸樂的時候，你只是把慾望收藏在你心身的隱處。誰知道在今日似乎避免了的事情，等到明日不會再浮現麼？連你的身體都知道他的遺傳興正當的需要而不肯被欺騙。—談逸樂　　只在你們從沉默的河中啜飲時，才眞能歌唱。只在你們達到山巔時，你們才開始攀援。只在大地索取你四肢時，你們才眞正的跳舞。—談死　　愛雖給你加冠，他也要釘你在十字架，他雖栽焙你，也剎剪你。—談愛　　你們的孩子都不是你們的孩子，乃是生命為自己所渴望的兒女。他們是借你們而來，卻不是從你們而來，他們雖和你們同在，卻不屬於你們。你們可以給他們以愛，卻不能給他們以思想，因為他們有自己的思想。—談孩子　　你把你的產業給人，那只算給了一點，當你以身佈施的時侯，那才是眞正的施與。—談施與　　生命的確是黑暗的，除非是有了激勵，一切的激勵都是盲目的，除非是有了知識，一切的知識都是徒然的，除非是有了工作，一切的工作都是虛空的，除非是有了愛。當你仁愛地工作的時候，你便與自己與人類，與上帝連繁為一。—談工作　　你的衣服掩蓋了許多的美，卻隱不住醜惡。你們雖在衣服裏可尋得隱秘的自由，卻也尋得橛飾與羈勒了。—談衣服　　你們是道，也是行道的人。當你們中有人跌倒的時候，他是為了他後面的人而跌倒，是一塊絆腳石的警吿。是的，他也為他前面的人而跌倒，因為他們的步履雖然又快又穩，卻沒有把那絆腳石挪開。—談罪與罰　　你們中如有人要審判一個不忠誠的妻子，讓他也拿天平來秤一秤她丈夫的心，拿尺來量一量他的靈魂。讓鞭撻擾人者的人先察一察那被擾者的靈性。—談罪與罰　　你們這些願持公正的法官，你們怎樣裁判那忠誠共外而盜竊其中的人？你們又將怎樣刑罰一個肉體受戮，而在他自已是心靈遭減的人？你們又將怎樣控吿那在行為上是刁猾，暴戾，而在事實上也是被威逼被虐待的人呢？—談罪與罰　　你們喜歡立法，卻也更喜歡犯法。如同那在海濱游戲的孩子，勤懇的建造了沙塔，然後又嘻笑的將他毀壞。—談法律　　你的心靈常常是戰塲，在戰塲上，你的理性與判斷和你的熱情與嗜慾開戰。我恨不能在你的心靈中作一個調停者，依我可以讓你們心中分子從爭競與釁隙變成合一與和鳴。—談理性與熱情外埠郵政代辦所鴉片的種植和吸用  綏人　　綏遠歸綏通訊　　近年來嚴厲禁毒的結果，內地各省都有相當的成效了。但在邊遠的省份以及有特殊關係的地方，因為種種的牽制，有的根本上無法禁止，有的只能在某種限度上加以禁止。在綏遠就是這種情形，雖然對於毒品中最劇烈的白麵白丸等嚴厲地禁止販賣和吸用，但於鴉片烟的種植和吸用則是公開的，或者說是官家所允許的。　　這個地方因為接近沙漢，牠的氣候是非常惡劣，而土地更是異常貧瘠的。一年四季是冷的早暖的晚，大部份的時間不能生長任何植物。而土地則是荒原無垠，耕作困難，因此，一般人民就都認種植鴉片為有利可圖了。　　種植鴉片也和種植其他植物一樣，是在春暖時下種，在夏來秋初時收穫。只要在道個期間不遇到塞外特有的冰雹，暴風，酷旱以及在收耯時的陰雨連綿，鴉片便可得到豐收了。　　鴉片的種籽分作兩種，一種是單頭，一種是複頭。單頭是一株鴉片只開一朶花，結一個粟頭。複頭是開幾朶花，結幾個栗頭。粟頭的多少雖然不同，但對於烟量的生產上並無多大影響。據有經騐的人說，複頭反不如單頭的生產量多。因為複頭生的粟頭既多，其體積也就小，所含的烟量也就少了。　　鴉片種植的方法，雖然與一　　物一樣，是按時下種，施肥料，芟草等，但為增加烟量，也用盡種種人工的力量。在田地中有水井，或因種烟而掘有水井的，大半用種植菜園和培餐花圃的方法來經營。他們在田地中築成許　菜畦和小的水道，除了施肥料，芟草外，天如不雨，則每日汲水灌溉。因此烟苗都長得異常肥大，烟的出產量當然也就因之增加了。這種叫做水烟。還有一種早烟，是與種核普通穀物一樣的，其所需的水量不能山人工來帮助，只有聽天由命。不過，水烟並不普遍。因在一般的田地中，掘井，灌溉需要很大的人力與財力，一般的農民大都負擔不起。只有靠近城市的菜園能從事水烟的種植。　　在每年的六七月之間，罌粟花便滿山遍野的開了。肥嫩的綠葉上托着紅白黃紫的美麗花朵。把這荒涼遼闊的原野頓時變成了美好的花園。罌票花的美麗，單從「阿芙蓉」這個別名上就可以知道了。在顏色和花的形式上，無論是單瓣或複辦，都興芙蓉完全一樣，只是稍微小點罷了。誰也想不到，這樣美艷的花竟會產生那種把人類毀家滅身的果呢！　　鴉片的收穫期是在七月的後牛月。在這時最要緊的是要天氣晴朗。因為在這時陽光越晒着栗頭，則割出的烟漿便也越多。如果在割烟的幾天遇上陰雨速綿的天氣，那烟的收穫就要大　减色了。　　因為割烟的期間只有很短促的幾天，所以必須多僱日工。這些日工又大都是癮君子，因此，於工資之外，必須加送少許烟膏，作為他們臨時過癮之用。割烟時，每人手執鐵形小刀一柄和圓形鐵盒一個。繞粟頭圍割一週，烟漿即隨之冒出，然後抹於鐵盒中。要是鐵盒滿了，便把牠集中到大的鐵橋裹。割烟也需要相當的技術和熟練，因為割的太深了或太淺了都要影響到烟的出產量的。　　鴉片收割完成之後，有的出售烟漿，有的把烟漿曝成烟土之後纔去出售。一般窮苦的農民大部份都是倫偷模摸地出售烟漿。因為他們在苛捐雜稅，高利貸的重壓之下，决沒有從容的時閒把牠晒成烟土之後再去出售的，而偷偷地出售烟漿，對於他們還可以省下一層烟土稅的剝削。　　此地所生產的鴉片，除了本地的居民消費一部份外，大部份都集中在此地所特有的烟土販的手裹。他們在此地設立烟土莊，從事收買，然後再推銷到別省去。本省烟土主要的銷塲是山西。因山西於嚴厲禁止白麵，白丸的吸用與販賣後，就實行鴉片公賣。最近因華北的特殊情形，平津也成了此地烟土的大好銷售市塲了。　　鴉片的價格在此地大的在大約一元到一元五角左右。最　的特候也不過兩元。普通零售，五分錢就可以買到些許的烟膏。　　吸用鴉片在此地是公開的。除了娼竂和供公眾吸用的烟館之外，大部份的居民都有這種嗜好。在交際塲中，鴉片烟也就成了主要的應酬工具。如果有客人來拜訪而不請他吸「洋烟」（本地人稱鴉片烟為洋烟），還無疑地是很失鱟面的。一般居民還有一種可怕的觀念，就是吸用「洋烟」是表示你時髦，闊綽，否則，就覺得你是很寒酸似的。　　此地的烟館開設得非常的多。每條街上總有兩三家。凡門首懸有　　記的字號和玻璃窗內擺著烟罐及小秤的，都是烟館。烟館一方面售贊烟膏，一方　燈供給吸用。一間黑暗的小屋內，在這塞外特有的大土坑上，經常的橫陳着三五個　君人在吞雲吐霧。　　在這樣的環境中，一般小有產的居民有這種嗜好，原不足為奇。最可驚的是在很多的貧民和乞丐中，也染有這種嗜好。在歸綏縣政府的附近，有一家貧民。一個母親和兩個兒子都有鴉片癮。兩個兒子是以縫鞋為業，每日的牧入不過三幾角錢。以這樣的收人而染有嗜好，所以時常沒有飯吃。乞丐在討得食物之後，還常聽見他喊出：「給點烟灰吧！給點烟灰吧！」的呼聲。可見鴉片烟在此地為害之烈了。　　在鴉片烟的種植，販賣，吸用上，形成一筆很大的稅收。因為種植鴉片，有所謂烟畝罰欵。販責，必須貼禁烟局的印花。吸用，又須納烟燈捐。烟畝罰欵在每年烟苗生出之後，由禁烟局派員會同各縣勘定丈量。因為水早烟的產量不同，罰欵的數目也因之而異。水烟的數目一般比旱烟多三分之一。烟燈捐普通的吸戶是沒有的。只有以營業為件質的烟館和娼寮纔繳納。烟館大半是每月五元。娼寮則分三等，最高的也是五元。烟土稅是由禁烟局發賣印花，按照烟土的重量，在販賣時加貼。要則便以私土沒收。　　在此地一時不能澈底禁烟，大概也是因稅收的關係。在道地瘠民貧的半沙漢地方，面積雖然較北方的任何省分為大，但人民稀少，毫無工商業可言，財政上的困難是任何省分所沒有的。所以，多年以來，就不得不靠這筆稅收，作為重要的挹注。　　從去年以來，地方政府會曾公佈分區禁種，限期烟民登記的辦法，打算從種植和吸用兩方面逐滿禁絕。但從財政上和目前華北的特殊關係上看來，這恐怕只是一種不能推行的官樣文章罷了。藝壇「再世復仇記」觀後感  立箴　　美國影片的特色仍舊在這一張片子里反映出來。　　小市民們看膩了大腿粉臂，自然得找另一種刺激，於是所謂恐怖影片少不得也走上了時運。推測其社會意義，還是與劍俠影片同共源流的。　　所謂「恐怕之王」卡洛夫主演的「再世復仇記」它是利用了所謂科學的進步，假設一個新的因果循環，用報復主義來發洩一個仇敵的警恨，所以這張影片可以說是最合我們中國民族「惡有惡報，善有善報」的傳統迷信，而使老太太，老太爺，甚至準老太太，準老太爺的小姐公子們看了大快人心而感到科學力量之偉大的。　　故事是這樣的：有梅力脫及屈格者，因犯案恐馬頓吐露眞情，與兩個操權舞彝的律師諾倫和羅德商議，定計先殺法官以期報復。恰巧埃爾門（卡洛夫飾）方出獄，苦無職業，屈格就詭稱法官的妻疑法官有外遇，要雇人窺伺法官的行動。埃爾門信以為眞，每晚在法官門外徘徊。一天，屈格等暗殺了法官，卽將屍移於埃爾門的車上，結果埃爾門被誣為兇手，判電刑處死。這一件事發生的當時，適為祁美與南茜所目睹，聞埃氏被處死刑，不忍坐視，遂據實告發，迨審判長電止行刑，巳不及了。埃氏雖死，終為科學家布門博士用最新科學方法將埃氏施救復活，但復活後，記憶力已失去，而友仇卻仍能判別，結果梅力脫和屈格兩人遭埃氏殺害，諾倫與羅德亦因再殺埃氏在飛逃時車撞燈桿而死。　　這故事的空想不實當然不容諱言，尤以科學能使人再生這一點更見荒唐。不過「法律吃人」卻給了一個深刻的描寫，我們不難由此推想，人類自有所謂法律以來，也不知有多少生命斷送於這一個名詞之下了！　　本來世界上有的是冤枉，沈冤莫白的事是早經司空見慣了的，但淺薄的報復思想就如「再世復仇記」所開列給我們的方式進行了。這又好像為的是要懲戒一般作惡多端的人的；因為他們對於過去的「果報」的思想已失去駕馭的力量了一，所以「新的果報說」說：「你們不能再作惡了，將來科學進步以後，任何惡人都難逃恢恢的天網的，猶如梅力股·屈格·諾倫和羅德。可不是嗎？他們不是終於都證了因果了嗎？」名人傳記幾個重要的探險家  泳石　　隨若產業的發展，文藝復興時代的出現，自由研究精神的發達，在十四世紀以後的西歐出現了各種的發明和發見。如時計，眼鏡，火藥，磁石，印刷術　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>等，都是這時代的重要發明。但在這些發明中，對於近代文明影響最大的，要算火藥和印刷術以及磁石三者。因為有了火藥，舊有的封建時代的武器和戰術才為之一變，武士的勢力也因之衰落；有了印刷術，近代文化才得大大的發展：而磁石的發現更使航海者敢在沒有星光的黑夜里大膽遠航，刺激了航海業的進步，因而刺激了產業和科學的發達。　　我們所要在這見介紹的與近代歷史有密切關係的幾位重要探險家，便是在近代文明開始的時期中，在磁石的發現和航海的發達的條件下出現的人物。　　英國發展新大陸的開端者加波特歐洲白人在北美勢力最大的要算英國人：差不多除南部一帶以外，所有這地方都滿印着英人的足跡。所以北美有「盎格魯撒克遜亞美利加」之稱。但英國發展新大陸的開端者則是的翰·加波特（John，Cabot　一四五〇——一四九八）。　　加波特在一四五〇年生於意大利的斐勒加，但他卻是侍奉英王亨利七世的船戶。就在哥倫布從橫斷大西洋的壯舉歸來的四年之後，在一四九七年，加波特即和他的兒子率同十八個部下，乘着小船馬休號出帆布列士特，發見了新的航路。　　他駕着小舟，乘風破浪，右三個月的危險的航海之後，到達了拉布刺達半島沿岸。那時他還以為自己到了中國；但他考察的結果，沒有發見繁華的都市，沒有什麼文明表現，這樣才迷惑起來，使他對這地方發生了不可思議的戚覺　　這惱時候，英國資本主義已在開始發展了，找殖民地的欲求，正在它心中成長。所以，加波特發現北美拉布刺達半島後，他即在英王的名字下佔領了這塊土地。從此英吉利王旗便開始在這荒島上飄揚，後來這地方便成為了不列顚帝國的殖民地。　　加波特從拉布刺達歸來，沿途差不一多行了一千哩的探險，在這年的八月六一日才算安抵布列士特港。他這次探險的成功，英王當然非常高興，除特別嘉獎他外，並給了他許多金錢和船隻，並派了很多的人充他的部下，命他再去探險。於是，在次年五月他又同他的見子率領眾人遠航，結果到達了北美的基沙皮克灣。但這里也沒有黃金，寶石，象牙等物，也是荒涼之地，所以他們很是失望，只得再行歸來。　　但是，這次安然歸來的只有加波特的兒子的船，其他的都不知道漂流到何處去了。因此，開於加波特的消息從此也就湮沒無聞。　　自此以後，英國人有一個很長久的時間沒有十分注意到新大陸：他們在北美的發展乃是較後的事。但不管怎樣，加波特的探險總算是英國殖民北美的先聲。　　法國開拓新大陸的先驅維拉扎羅果凡尼·達·維拉扎羅（Giovanni　da　Terrazano一四八〇——一五二七）本來也是意大利人，他的誕生地是弗羅倫斯，但因他久在法蘭西生活，所以他探險的成續也就是法國的了。　　一五二四年，維拉扎羅率領五十人西向大西洋航行，在羅斯加羅利那的沙嘴邊發見了陸地。當下他便在非常高與中，在他的隨身日記上寫着：此處是前人未到的新陸地。　　從此他更續往南行，經通一些時間後，更折向北進，途中他發見了許多港灣，就中之一便是紐約灣。在這里他看到了哈德孫河口，引起了他特別的注意，並預見了今日紐約市的發展。本來，這哈德孫河的名稱是由此後再發見它的亨利·哈德孫所給的，但事實上維拉扎羅的發見是在先此的八十五年。　　隨後維拉扎羅繼續航行，到達了諾凡新戈夏半島，知道了加拿大。這便是後來法人佔領加拿大的根據。　　為西班牙征服墨西哥的可爾特斯當西班牙發展的時候，差不多美洲大部都是它的屬地；墨西哥當然也是其中之一。但最先由探險而征服墨西哥的，乃是在十六世紀初的西班牙軍人赫爾蘭德·可爾特斯（Hernando　Cortes　一四八五——一五四七）。　　在一五一九年二月，有一隊西班牙軍人聽到在西方有金鑛豐饒的陸地；這些靑年軍人素富冒險性，所以他們聽到這消息後，馬上就由一位隊長率領到這產金地去探險。這位隊長，便是可爾特斯。　　可爾特斯率領的一隊西班牙靑年軍人由古巴島出帆，在現今的委拉古魯斯市上陸，向着現在的墨西哥市前進。在上陸時，他曾用「破釜沈舟」的辦法，把他們所乘的船破壞，向隊員們表示不進即死的决心。這樣，在三個月之後，他們終於到達了其所希望的黃金都市墨西哥。　　但是，這黃金都市中住的有墨西哥土人，他們有組織，有領袖，遠來的西班牙人不易進去。因此可爾特斯便用詭計，把墨西哥士人首領虜獲，並突向失掉首領的士人進攻，終於把這黃金都市征服了。從此墨西哥市和其附近的地方都為西班牙所佔據，它的領土便擴大到新大陸了。　　隨後，他們又聽到鬨都拉斯有富饒的鑛產，並在那里有到太平洋的海峽，因之在一五二四年可爾特斯又從墨西哥市出發，經過三千哩的遠征後，更到達了鬨都拉斯灣；由此又乘船繼續前進，直到了茲爾基羅。這個地方便是以後往中美探險的新的出發點。科學業話  諒殺人光線　　所謂殺人光綫，是英人格林特爾·馬休斯發明的。他之開始公開研究這種前所未聞的怪光錢，是在一千九百十五年，即是在距今二十年以前的時侯。　　馬休斯研究死光，曾得到了英政府的一二五，〇〇〇圓的補助金。自他實行奇異的實騐以來，一向世界各國都沒有人發表關於研究這怪光綫的何等的報吿，所以這光綫一時間在名實上都成為了英國獨佔研究的東西。　　英政府對於這個怪光錢的研究，不知什麼緣故，簡直是極蓋保護的能事。他們在維爾士山地上建築了近代的科學魔城，周圍都張着通電流的鐵條，在四方還裝置着不可視的光錢，這位科學家馬休斯便件在這樣的科學魔城中，與世隔絕，專心地去研究他那殺人光綫。他這樣苦心的研究不僅犧牲畢生的精神，而且是賭着生命的，因為在這能殺人的光錢之研究中，在這樣的科學魔城內，偶一不愼，也有可能將自己殺死的。　　馬休斯的研究雖然很秘密，但當此各國都在拚命準備殺人大戰的時候，別的科學家也會想到如何利用光綫來殺人的。因此，在他的研究之後，別的國家的科學者也實行了並不劣於他的研究。如大家所知道的，美國電氣學者特斯拉所研究的怪光錢能殺死數英里之外的兔；如意大利馬可尼及德國杜尼可斯基等現刻也正一在秘密研究怪光綫，其研究到底進展到了什麼程度，外人雖不得而知，但總可預料那也必然是殺人利器吧。　　同時，在最近，克路加博士更發現了比從來的X光綫還要強十六倍的不可視的怪力光綫。這個怪力光綫由其放射機放射出來，可以殺傷五十米突以外的生物。據檢查，那被照射的生物，在其血球中的白血球是被減少了八十分之三或二十分之一。而且，依克略加博士的實騐，這光綫的放射機如隱蔽在地下，那在這附近是任何人都不能接近的。此外如戰車等的司機人，這光錢也可以把他射殺。　　這樣，所謂殺人光錢的出現，已經成為事實了；而且這光錢的種類還很多，現在誰也猜不透就中要算那一種最為厲害。文藝作品少女的母性（四）  少雄　　她巴不得那小的孩子除了喂乳和更換尿屎布的時候之外，老是不聲不響的睡在床上。可是這也不好：這孩子白天裏睡眠過度了，晚上便要不時的醒來，捧頭縮腳的啼哭着，吵得要給他伴睡的母親夜間不得安眠，白天裹做事沒有精神，使她的工作又無形地受了損失。至於大的孩子，她更是希望他能跟着雲蓮整天在屋子外玩耍，只要不闖禍，不和別的孩子們鬧事就好。她常常慫恿着他說：　　『乖囝囝，你很乖的，你到雲蓮那裹去玩。過一歇，等媽媽賺了錢買糖給你吃。」　　不過，這也有例外。如果這孩子在外面玩得過久了，她又要記掛他了。　　是一個星期日的上午，這男女兩主人在樓上一間兼充書室的臥房裹，面對面的坐在寫字檯旁，合譯着一部英文小字典。書局限他們於兩月內交稿，眼見得一個月已過去，而譯文還沒有完成一半，因此工作頓形緊張而忙碌起來。這時，小的孩子正展開着四肢，安然地酣睡着，全身在床上排成了一個大而潦草的「太」字；那大的孩子也出去玩了。室內的空氣像死一般的岑寂：有時夫婦偶然說一兩句閒話，或妻子遇字典中有些疑難的字句，要求丈夫解答，除此以外，差不多只有查詢英漢字典時翻動書頁的聲音，以及鋼筆沙沙地在紙上移動着的聲音。　　突然間，小的孩子醒了，兩手捧着頭部，兩腿懸空的蜷曲着，用力地伸了一個懶腰，接着便是啼哭。女主人的心怔了一怔，但仍不動聲色似的寫着她的東西。　　孩子哭得更利害了，聲音忽而急促而緊張，忽而又拖長得像透不出氣的樣子。她皺了一下眉，可是依然沒有想抱他的意思。　　孩子的哭已堅持了四五分鐘，聲音仍是那麼的大，好像永不會停息似的，同時，這哭聲裏似乎也含有悲哀的成分和反抗的意味。那個平素對孩子漠然不甚關心的男主人，到這時也有些不忍起來。　　『孩子在哭呢！」他對妻子說，意思是要她去抱，但他自己卻並不動手，好像抱撫孩子只是女人範圍內的事。　　『雲蓮買紙烟去了，馬上就回來的，讓她去抱罷。她非常喜歡抱孩子。……讓他哭一會，不要緊的。』她坦然的說。　　果然，女主人說完了話，剛提着鋼筆去濡墨水時，就聽得樓下開門的聲音　　『來了！來了！』雲蓮纔踏上樓梯，便這麼熱情地呌喊着，無疑地，她巳聽見了孩子的哭聲了。於是她就迅速地上樓。把買來物事和餘錢交給了女主人，雲蓮就走到床前，把孩子擊舉起來，一面向他裝着哭臉，調弄他說：　　「呵！這樣苦呀！這樣可憐呀！傷心呢！」　　孩子的哭本來巳預備靜止了，經她這麼一說，彷彿是觸動了悲懷，又傷着嘴臉，哀哀地哭起來了。（未完）播音特別節目　　麗琳社　　中西（一〇四〇）上午十一時至十二時　　前奏曲（口琴劍秋）人面桃花（麗娟）夜深深（麗琳）休息五分鐵（麗麗）警變（麗琦）太平花（麗娜）我不能忘記您（麗娟）好妹妹（麗琳）愛向何處零（麗麗）鋤頭舞歌（劍秋）　　雷電劇社話劇　　李樹德（九四〇）中午零時三刻至一時半　　「南歸」　　領導：陳奕　　播演者：金儀，林蜚，馬翎，董偉。　　月星歌詠社　　利利（一二四〇）下午二時至三時　　新鳳陽歌（張偉）小天使（夏斐）新鳳求鳳佩雯）永遠在後台（　玲）新夜來香（梁嫣國花（茉茜）城市之光（莉茜）燕雙飛（莉潔）娘子軍（張偉）賣花女（茉茜）等一等吧（璐玲）（莉潔）春潮回來吧（施蘊）（佩雯）鋤頭舞歌（全體）　　鮑明珊「口琴教授及演奏」　　安定（八六〇）下午三時至四時　　　沙爾維琪之歌　裘麗恩探戈　寶待草　暮谷思燈　昔年春夢（尚有其他節目臨時報吿）　　嚇嚇嚇歌詠社　　亞東（七六〇）下午九時至十時　　　　　　（　　）永遠在後台（王瑛）鳳陽花　（王瑛）新女性（曼妮）伏爾加曲（孫方）救國歌（苗珊）月灣灣（曼琳）　　上海市廣播電台每日節目　　上午　一一·四五　　愛國音樂　　一二·〇〇　　報時　氣象　新聞　西樂　　下午　四·一五　　歌唱　　四·三〇　口零（中華口琴會）　　五·〇〇　教育局吳士謙先生講：新生活運動公的「今日事今日做　　五·三〇　平劇　　六·〇〇　週內重要新聞　平劇　　六·三〇　新聞　氣象　國際貿易　　介紹消息　平劇電影銀色雜筆  之爾　　趙丹葉露茜，唐納藍蘋，頋而已杜明潔三對藝人，今日下午在杭州六和塔下舉行「六和」典禮，證婚人為沈鈞儒先生。　　三對藝人是乘昨（二十五）晨七時一刻的快車赴杭的，在杭「蜜日旅行」一天，並舉行婚體之外，價定今日晚車返滬。　　五月三日，這三對藝人還擬借八仙橋靑年會邀親友們茶敘一次，茶敘中還有話劇，歌唱，跳舞等遊藝，已接洽好了的，有因立間專郎毓秀小姐等歌唱，擄新人們云，除邀請表演之外，還希望新友們能自動參加云。　　上海劇院的「貧非罪」本來據說是演三天的，但結果祇演了二天，便吿綴演。　　中國旅行劇團今晨九時半在卡爾登預演「雷雨」這個戲要演四小時之久。據唐槐秋氏云：最好請帶些麫包來看戲，或者把早餐喫得飽些。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Arita Hosts Foreign Journalists, Explains Japanese Diplomacy, Implements Peaceful Policies Towards China and Russia, and Requests Freedom of Trade with Britain and the United States <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, at 3:30 PM on the 25th, met with foreign news reporters at his official residence to elaborate on the Japanese government's diplomatic policies. The Director of the Information Department, Amau, was also present. The Foreign Minister then engaged in a question-and-answer session with the reporters, explaining specific policies until 5 PM. The contents of the diplomatic policies expressed by the Foreign Minister to the reporters are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan's diplomatic policy, as elucidated in the Imperial Rescript issued by the Emperor upon Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, remains unchanged to this day. We aim to stabilize East Asia, foster close relations with friendly nations, and contribute to world peace and human happiness. There have always been numerous methods advocated and implemented for the maintenance of world peace, but none have proven fully effective. We firmly believe that nations should eliminate the root causes threatening peace and make their best efforts to maintain peace within their capabilities. For Japan, the stabilization of East Asia is a matter of national survival and a divinely bestowed responsibility to the world. To fulfill this weighty responsibility, it is necessary to establish good neighborly relations with neighboring countries, namely China and Russia, with "Manchukuo" at the center, to stabilize the overall situation.</p>
<p>Recently, as a result of frequent disputes in the areas bordering Manchuria, Russia, and Mongolia, various rumors have spread in Europe and America. However, we will never initiate illegal acts of aggression unless provoked by hostile actions. There are currently various pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan-Manchukuo. We believe these issues can be resolved amicably through diplomatic negotiations. China and Japan, sharing the same script and ethnicity, have a relationship akin to lips and teeth. It goes without saying that the primary goal of both countries is to coexist and prosper together. However, as the two countries are neighbors, various problems naturally arise, which is unavoidable. But we sincerely hope that the two major friendly nations of East Asia will cooperate closely to ensure peace in East Asia. In Europe and America, some people often criticize Japan's policy towards China with malicious intent. However, if these countries were to stand in Japan's position and face the actual situation squarely, they would surely understand our attitude.</p>
<p>We also constantly strive to improve relations with Britain, the United States, and other countries in other aspects, paying particular attention to relations with countries around the Pacific Ocean. Recently, conflicts of interest in trade and commerce have been observed between Japan and these countries. However, these are not insurmountable if appropriate adjustments are made from a standpoint of mutual dependence. At this juncture, to revitalize the world economy and promote international peace, we propose to restore freedom of trade and foster an atmosphere of freedom and trust internationally. This will undoubtedly make a great contribution to human well-being and prosperity. (Telegraph from Allied Press, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Arita Says No Need to Conclude Non-Aggression Pact Proposed by Soviet Russia <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Foreign Minister Arita elaborated on diplomatic policies to foreign news reporters, the foreign reporters raised various questions. The following is a record of the questions and answers between the reporters and the Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Some in America are concerned about the occurrence of a Russo-Japanese war. What is your view?</p>
<p>The current situation has not reached the point of war. It is also possible that Europe and America are exaggerating the facts and spreading rumors.</p>
<p>Is a Russo-Japanese war impossible?</p>
<p>Napoleon once said, "The word 'impossible' is not in my dictionary."</p>
<p>Are Russo-Japanese relations worse than they were several years ago?</p>
<p>There are now more pending issues than before, and there have been an increase of incidents such as border issues.</p>
<p>Does Japan intend to conclude a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty?</p>
<p>In 1932, when Ambassador Yoshizawa, stationed in France, was returning to Japan, Foreign Minister Litvinov of the Soviet Union made this proposal when he passed through Moscow. However, it was rejected because the timing was premature. Japan proposed to Russia to handle border disputes and establish a border demarcation committee, which would have a greater effect in practice. Japan continues to pursue negotiations based on this policy today.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is increasing its military buildup in the Far East. Does Japan intend to demand that the Soviet Union reduce its Far Eastern forces to an equal level with Japan's?</p>
<p>Japan is quite concerned about the Soviet Union maintaining an excessive military presence in the Far East. Reducing Soviet military buildup would alleviate the atmosphere between the two countries, which everyone recognizes. However, Japan has never made the withdrawal or reduction of the Soviet Far Eastern Army a subject of negotiations with Russia.</p>
<p>What impact does the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty have on Japan's diplomacy towards Russia?</p>
<p>Although France has stated that this treaty does not extend to the Far East, some observers in Japan believe that the Soviet Union, having obtained security guarantees for its western borders through the treaty, will be able to devote its remaining resources to strengthening its influence in the Far East in the future.</p>

<p>Does Japan intend to conclude a Japanese-German alliance to counter the Franco-Soviet treaty?</p>
<p>Some people in Japan are enthusiastically advocating for Japanese-German cooperation, but the government authorities have not considered this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japan's So-Called Three Principles Towards China, Arita Says to Implement Its Spirit <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>You served as Ambassador to China and met with Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Qun in Nanjing. What was the impact?</p>
<p>The purpose of my talks with the Nanjing leadership was to deepen mutual understanding, not to conduct formal negotiations on a specific topic. Therefore, I cannot speak of its concrete effects. However, based on the impression I received from this meeting, there are many difficulties ahead for China and Japan, and a great deal of effort is needed.</p>
<p>Will Japan proceed with negotiations with China based on the so-called three principles?</p>
<p>I am determined to inherit the policies of former Foreign Minister Hirota and to realize Sino-Japanese cooperation in the spirit of the three principles.</p>
<p>Will the three principles be applied through coercive means or through a method of mutual concession?</p>
<p>There is no need for a coercive policy. It goes without saying that mutual peaceful means should be used to gradually increase the density of cooperation between the two countries. (Telegraph from Allied Press, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">General Supervisor Chiang Issues Order to Seriously Investigate and Register Opium Smokers <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Ensuring that there are no omissions or false reports after this investigation.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) General Supervisor Chiang issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments and the special commissioners for prohibition in each province on the 25th to supervise and urge a serious investigation and registration of opium smokers, ensuring that there are no omissions or false reports, and to prepare a report for verification. The original order stated that the purpose of this investigation and registration of opium smokers is, on the one hand, to obtain the accurate number of smokers to serve as a standard for establishing opium addiction treatment centers and implementing phased treatment based on age, and, on the other hand, to obtain the accurate total amount smoked by all smokers to serve as a basis for unified management and allocation of supply and demand, ensuring that the established method of gradual reduction year by year is followed until prohibition is achieved, and there is no room for carelessness or perfunctoriness, and any omissions. However, opium smokers in various places may not understand the government's policies and intentions, and often hide and do not register due to overly strict suppression, or even if they register and obtain a license, they do not report the true amount smoked, or they report more than they smoke, or even report less than they smoke. Although this is generally due to the smokers' concealment and fear, hoping to evade punishment, the responsible officials of governments at all levels should also supervise and urge personnel at all levels to conduct serious investigations and practical inspections, ensuring that there are no omissions or false reports after this investigation, so that the promotion of the prohibition policy can be completed as scheduled. All those who are registered as smokers and the amount they reported should be compiled in a statistical table of the number of registered smokers in accordance with Article 7 of the investigation method after the completion of the process and submitted for review. The statistical table is now issued, and two copies should be prepared and submitted within half a month by the provincial and municipal governments together with the special commissioners to compile two copies of the summary table, one to be transferred to this General Supervision Office for verification and one to be submitted to the provincial and municipal governments for review and inspection for management purposes.

Military Attaché Wachi, Military Attaché Hayama from Suiyuan, Chief of the Zhangjiakou Military Affairs Organ Oomoto, and Chief of the Shanhaiguan Special Affairs Organ Hosoki have all arrived in Tianjin on the 23rd and 24th to await the meeting. Deputy Chief of the Beiping Special Affairs Organ Hamada said that the military attachés meeting in Tianjin will open on the afternoon of the 26th. The military attachés from various places will arrive tonight. The purpose of this meeting is to listen to Chief of Staff Nagami's report on the proceedings of the division commanders' meeting and to convey the opinions of the central department. It is difficult to say how many days the meeting will last. It is scheduled to depart from Tianjin and return to Beiping on the 27th. It is uncertain whether Matsumuro will meet with Song Zheyuan. Communist prevention in Hebei and Chahar is indeed a major event, but this military attachés meeting has not prepared to study this matter. There is no written document such as a Sino-Japanese communist prevention agreement, nor are there any special conditions stipulated. Chief of Staff Ishii is returning to the country to attend the chiefs of staff meeting and does not bear any mission. There are no new changes in the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue.

<h3 id="e20">Flood Prevention During the Peach Blossom Flood Season <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Our country has suffered from floods year after year, which has almost become a common occurrence. The severity of the disaster last year was far beyond comparison with the past. The two major river systems in the north and south competed to flood, echoing each other. The vastness of the affected area and the duration of the disaster directly exhausted those engaged in disaster relief. Not to mention the material losses, from the perspective of the value of life, countless people were swallowed by the floodwaters and buried in the stomachs of fish, countless people floated and sank, becoming companions of the waves, countless people were displaced and unable to find shelter, and countless people were infected with plagues and had no one to tell. Outside the disaster-stricken areas, some people worked tirelessly to engage in relief efforts, while others ran around and appealed for donations. The spirit of sacrifice is difficult to quantify. The nation, already weakened by exploitation, has suffered such a terrible catastrophe. Although years have passed, the wounds have not yet fully healed. Unless one is forgetful, how can one not feel a sense of trepidation? Now that the peach blossom flood season has arrived again, and disaster is imminent, we, like birds startled by the bow, feel apprehension for the future and dare to use the already moving events to awaken the ears and eyes of the people. We will not refrain from persistent admonishments.</p>
<p>The engineering project to close the breach in the Yellow River has been urged and promoted, and the report from Dongzhuang recently announced the imminent closure of the river. The residents living near the water have been worried for a long time, and this comforting news is better than nothing and is welcomed by everyone. However, the sediment flow of the Yellow River and the volume of the floodwaters have been increasing year by year, while the downstream river channel is narrow and silted up. In addition, the winter freeze was particularly severe, with heavy snow accumulation in the upper reaches. Once the summer season arrives, the melting ice is likely to cause surges. This is something that Mr. Kong Xianrong, who is in charge of closing the breach, has clearly stated. The dangerous and stable situation of the river section changes rapidly, and Mr. Kong also believes that it is not easy to predict. Now, at the beginning of the peach blossom flood season, the water level downstream has been raised repeatedly, and there are urgent reports from the river works in Hebei and Shandong. It is difficult to be optimistic that we can avoid breaches during this year's flood season. As for the Yangtze River, although the people's embankments in various counties have been largely repaired, the overall prevention plan is still being developed. The embankment works in the suburbs of Wuhan are delayed and have not yet been completed, and the remote embankments along the Xiang River are also awaiting supervision and promotion. Recently, two typhoons and rainstorms have attacked Wuhan. Is this not a warning from heaven to the people of Hubei? We silently observe that this year's flood situation is likely to be more severe than before, while most of the water control projects are still stagnant. If the authorities do not strive with increased effort and plan ahead, the fear of the people will be difficult to dispel.</p>
<p>Recently, the Economic Committee has notified the flood prevention bureaus of various provinces to start flood prevention work earlier. Kong Xiangrong has also returned to Jinan to discuss Yellow River management with Han Fuqu. Experts from the League of Nations, such as water conservancy experts Gustav and Ponderley, have been dispatched to Wuhan to inspect the embankment works. The authorities' concern for the people's suffering can be seen from this. We sincerely hope that those in charge will be mindful of past failures, resolutely seek self-improvement, use coordination as a basis, and be realistic as a reliance. Everyone should think of fulfilling their own responsibilities and avoid making excuses and shifting blame. They should plan the allocation of engineering projects in advance to avoid panic when danger arises. The lives of millions of people cannot withstand the endless prayers.</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) According to investigations, smuggled goods such as white sugar, cloth, seaweed, and salt shipped from Tianjin southward via the Tianjin-Peixian Railway reach more than 50,000 tons per month. The Tianjin Customs cannot stop it. The Railway Bureau cannot refuse transport because Japanese merchants pay the freight. Various untaxed goods are sold in Jinan, Xuzhou, Bianliang, Zhengzhou, and Bengbu, causing the value of goods from a certain country in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan provinces to plummet.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee's report on the review of the draft constitution submitted to the Legislative Yuan lists 23 points that should be further revised, with one opinion attached. The eight-member committee established by the Legislative Yuan to examine and revise the constitution can complete the drafting of the constitutional clauses and texts by the 28th based on the revision points and opinions issued by the central government. Then, it will be submitted to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for review. The 24-member committee can also hold its fourth meeting on the 29th to complete the drafting of the reserved clauses and appendixes regarding the distribution of the number of representatives in the National Assembly Representative Election Law and conclude all its work on drafting the two National Assembly laws. As for the central government's decision that the representatives from the Northeast should be combined with the regional election representatives from the provinces and cities for distribution, the 24-member committee only needs to readjust the originally allocated number of regional election representatives. However, the total number of National Assembly representatives remains at 1,200 and has not been increased as a result. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has scheduled the promulgation of the draft constitution, the National Assembly Organization Law, and the Representative Election Law for May 5. It has decided to hold review meetings continuously. The five-member drafting committee, including Fu Bingchang and Lin Bin, continued to hold discussions on the 25th, carefully organizing the distribution table of the number of representatives for each region and scheduled review meetings for the original five-member drafting committee and the 24-member drafting committee on the afternoons of the 28th and 29th to organize the clauses in the election law and submit them to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for discussion one day in advance. According to Fu Bingchang, the draft constitution and the National Assembly Representative Election Law and Organization Law must be submitted to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for discussion within the next week. If the plenary session cannot complete the discussion in one day, it will continue to be held on the second day to review and approve the three draft plans and submit them to the Central Political Committee for transfer to the National Government for promulgation.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has scheduled to urgently review important cases such as the draft constitution, the National Assembly Organization Law, the National Assembly Representative Election Law, and the revised Organization Law of the Executive Yuan.

The convocation period for the temporary meetings will be scheduled for May 1 and 2 to continue holding meetings. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The annual budget of the Ministry of Finance includes a special item for the printing fees of public bond certificates. The Unified Public Bond and the Reconstruction Public Bond issued this year were printed by the Zhonghua Book Company, with printing fees amounting to 359,802 yuan. The ministry included this amount in the additional budget and submitted it to the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for approval. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance stated that the printing fees for the Unified Reconstruction Public Bond, which was ordered to be issued this time, amounted to more than 359,000 yuan. The original budget for bond printing fees was insufficient to meet the needs of this newly added facility. It has been approved by the central government to add the amount according to the case.

<p>(Nanjing) The national general budget for the twenty-fifth year is currently being compiled by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics in conjunction with various ministries and departments. Regarding the main tax revenue portion of the income, it has been learned from financial circles that customs duties still rank first, salt taxes second, and consolidated taxes third. However, due to reasons such as reduced imports and rampant smuggling, the customs revenue figures have been reduced compared to the twenty-fourth year. At the same time, the consolidated tax figures have increased compared to the twenty-fourth year due to the prosperity of domestic industry and commerce. However, the increase in consolidated taxes is not enough to offset the decrease in customs duties, resulting in a slight shortfall. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case in which the Tianjin-Shanghai Shipping Association requested a two-month extension for the original tonnage tax validity period for ships trapped in ice outside Dagu Port, the Ministry of Transportation consulted the Ministry of Finance for handling. The Ministry of Finance has already instructed the customs authorities to order the Inspectorate General of Customs to investigate and report to the Ministry, and has forwarded the reply to the Ministry of Transportation for review. The content of the reply is as follows: After investigation, the ice-bound vessels at Dagu Port this time were indeed due to an unexpected event and suffered great difficulties. The request to extend the deadline for ship tax licenses should be approved in accordance with the law. However, the length of time that each vessel was trapped varies, and none were trapped for as long as two months. If all ship tax license deadlines are uniformly extended by two months, it would obviously be inappropriate. The relevant customs commissioners have been instructed to notify the trapped vessels to submit accurate evidence to the customs, proving how much each vessel was delayed according to the original schedule, and then extend the license deadline separately according to the number of days delayed, to ensure fairness. However, the methods determined this time are for a special situation and should not be regarded as a regular practice in the future. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jingzhou, Director of the Gansu Provincial Finance Department, came to Beijing to meet with Kong Xiangxi to report on the recent financial situation of Gansu Province and ask for instructions on everything. Zhu said that Gansu Province's financial situation for this year is as follows: the estimated national income for the 25th year is 3,228,242 yuan, and the estimated national expenditure is 4,766,059 yuan, with a shortfall of 1,537,817 yuan. The estimated local income is 4,736,083 yuan, and the estimated local expenditure is 5,575,471 yuan, with a shortfall of 839,388 yuan. The total shortfall for national and local expenditures is 2,377,205 yuan. The reason for this is the decrease in income and the expansion of expenditures. The reason for the insufficient income is entirely due to the impact of the phased prohibition of opium and the abolition of harsh taxes, and the conversion of military colonies into civilian ones. The income has decreased by more than 3.4 million yuan compared to the 23rd year, resulting in a shortfall of 2,377,700 yuan this year. If the income can still maintain the situation in the 23rd year, then not only will the income and expenditure be balanced, but there will also be a surplus of more than 1 million yuan. Therefore, from a numerical point of view, Gansu Province's finances have indeed made considerable progress in the past three years. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Supreme Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued Public Bulletin No. 195, stating that a detachment of Italian troops on the northern front occupied the city of Badach Giurgis at the southernmost end of Lake Chana yesterday.

<p>(Addis Ababa) Our correspondent Auchana reports that two Italian heavy bombers flew over the city at 8:30 this morning. One of them flew very low, only 500 meters above the ground, presumably to take photographs. The two planes flew away at 9:30. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Military sources here learned today that Jijiga is expected to be occupied next week. However, before occupying the town, Italian troops must defeat the Ethiopian army led by Turkish General Wehib in Sassabane, and then cross the plains and drive back the Ethiopian army that intends to defend the highlands to protect Jijiga. After the occupation of Jijiga, the fall of Harar will no longer be a problem, as its defenses are weak. The next target of attack will be Dire Dawa on the Jibuti railway. It is reported that two cavalry battalions have begun to deploy sentry posts along the border of British Somaliland. After the Italian troops reach the railway, they will also set up these sentry posts along the border of French Somaliland to prevent the import of military supplies into Ethiopia.

<p>(Jerusalem) After the conflict between Arabs and Jews, Fakri, the Arab Muslim leader and Chairman of the Muslim Committee, recently stated to our interviewer that Arabs and Jews have lived peacefully in Palestine for two centuries and have always maintained good relations. After the British government appointed Storrs as the military governor of Palestine, Storrs organized a Jewish National Home without consulting the people. The Arab and Jewish nations developed resentment because of this. Later, at the end of the European War, during the Versailles Peace Conference, Dr. Weizmann, in the name of the Jewish National Delegation, advocated the restoration of the Jewish state and organized a parliament for it. For the Arabs, they wanted to live and work in peace in their own country, and they should naturally reject foreigners entering their territory in order to maintain their national independence. By 1919, a democratic parliamentary system was established in the Jewish National Home. The Arabs also convened a congress and demanded its cancellation. Subsequent congresses also made such demands, but they were not satisfied, and the disturbances began from that year and have continued to occur. Previously, in 1930, a British parliamentary delegation was sent to Palestine to conduct an investigation. The conclusion was that the land held by each Muslim should be increased from an average of two acres to three acres as a relief measure. This proposal was subsequently passed by the British House of Commons and published in a white paper, becoming the established policy of the British government. However, the Jews immediately opposed it, and Prime Minister MacDonald revoked the white paper two weeks later. Since then, the land owned by Jews in Palestine has been increasing day by day, while the land owned by Muslims has been decreasing day by day. Up to now, Arabs are convinced that the British government is still being oppressed by the Jews in the country. If this continues, all the land owned by Arabs will inevitably be exploited and they will be forced to flee abroad. This is why we are indignant. The Arabs have failed to advocate justice by peaceful means. The British government can only express sympathy for us, otherwise we will not only not support Britain, but will treat it as the greatest enemy. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Jerusalem) The Arab Muslim leader Fakri yesterday gave a statement to our interviewer on the past relationship between Jews and Arabs, the causes of the current conflict, and declared that if the British government cannot express sympathy for the Arabs, they will not only not support Britain, but will treat it as the greatest enemy. Joseph, a member of the Jewish People's Assembly, also gave a statement to our interviewer, responding to Fakri's remarks, saying, "There is no fear of not having a place to live for Arabs and Jews who live together in Palestine. It is hoped that the leaders of the Arab nation will deeply understand this point." As far as we Jews are concerned, we will never give up the ideal of building a nation in Palestine, and we have great trust in the British government. Since the immigration of Jews to this area and the increase in the number of people, we also hope that the Arabs will therefore have to seek a compromise with us. In short, we do not intend to change our policy, and we very much hope that the promises previously provided by the British government can also be fulfilled at this time. As for the land issue, the Arabs often say that the Jews have seized and annexed land. In fact, whether they sell their land or not, the right is in their hands, and it has nothing to do with the Jews. Furthermore, the remarks made by the Muslim leader Fakri yesterday threatening the British government are meaningless. "It should be known that after the European War, Britain has allowed the Arab nation to establish several independent kingdoms as a reward for their participation in the war. Therefore, for the sake of the interests of the Arabs, whether they should support Britain, they must know how to plan for themselves." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Jerusalem) Our interviewer recently visited a British official in the Governorate of Jerusalem and asked about the conflict between Arabs and Jews. The reply was: "We have no grasp on what the future holds, which is truly unfortunate." Our interviewer asked about the severity of the incident, and the official said, "I also have some knowledge of it." Our interviewer then visited Roca, the acting mayor of Tel Aviv, a city where Jews are concentrated, and a member of the Jewish National Committee. He explained in detail the Jewish point of view, stating, "Tel Aviv is vibrant and can be called the best in the world. The 150,000 residents of the city are known for their law-abiding and industriousness, which has led to local prosperity. Jews and Arabs share the benefits. In addition, compulsory education has been implemented in the city, and children can attend school for free, which is unique in the Near East. It can be seen that the Jews' achievements in culture are also very great. It is a pity that although Britain has promised to protect our safety, we are now surrounded on all sides. The atrocities committed by Arabs in various places recently are truly appalling. Jews are often attacked for no reason, and even killed. But we firmly believe that justice still exists, and the world will not fail us. Therefore, we still work as usual, hoping to benefit ourselves and others. However, officials in various places do not punish troublemakers according to the law, which has harmed peace-loving people, which we regret. It is hoped that world consciousness can exert pressure on the authorities in various places in Palestine to curb violence and prevent it from spreading, which would be good." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Jerusalem) Our correspondent reports that the situation here today is still peaceful. Since Friday is the day of prayer for Arabs, the leaders of the tribe advised the believers to remain calm beforehand. Therefore, as soon as the prayer ceremonies in various temples were completed, they dispersed peacefully without causing trouble. Demonstrations were held in Haifa, Tulkarm, and Amman, but no major disturbances occurred. Among them, some houses in the Jewish residential area of Haifa were set on fire by Arabs, resulting in considerable losses. According to Jewish sources, the current situation is gradually improving, which is probably a sign of the situation stabilizing. However, the Arabs still claim that they will fight to the end unless their demands are completely satisfied. (Note: The Arabs have two demands: 1. Jews must not buy land in Palestine; 2. Immigration of Jews to Palestine should be stopped by all means.) The leaders of the Arab tribes have also scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to discuss the course of action. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(London) According to this newspaper's reporter, the French government wishes to understand three things regarding the German memorandum of March 31:  Does German leader Hitler view himself solely as the leader of the people of Germany proper, or does he also view himself as the leader of German minorities in Austria, Czechoslovakia, the autonomous region of Memel, and the Free City of Danzig? Does German leader Hitler believe he has already obtained equal rights, or if not, what methods does he plan to use to obtain these rights? Is Germany prepared to participate in mutual assistance organizations? If not, will the issue of whether mutual assistance pacts can be reconciled with non-aggression pacts (as suggested by Germany) be debated again? French Ambassador Corbin raised a private memorandum including these questions during his meeting with British Under-Secretary Sir Robert Vansittart on Wednesday.  Furthermore, what is Germany's true intention regarding the issue of ethnic minorities, and does it intend to revise its current borders? This is also something France urgently wants to know. As for whether the list of questions the British government should raise regarding the German memorandum will explicitly address the colonial issue or only allude to it vaguely, it is still unknown at this time. In short, while the questions raised by the French government are generally more practical than those the British intend to raise to Germany, the views of the British and French governments are ultimately in agreement. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) In accordance with the resolutions passed at the Second Locarno Conference, the British government will submit a list of questions to Germany, asking it to provide supplementary explanations for the memorandum of March 31.  These questions have not yet been submitted. Britain and France, as well as Britain and Belgium, are holding prior talks to consult with each other. French Ambassador to Britain Corbin met with Under-Secretary of State Vansittart this morning, marking the beginning of these consultations. It is reported that Ambassador Corbin clearly explained to the Under-Secretary the points that France wishes to understand, particularly Germany's attitude towards Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania, which is of great concern to France. However, it is generally expected that while the note that Britain is to deliver to Germany will be based on France's concerns, it will not list all the points mentioned by France, as the note is usually drafted solely by the Foreign Office and not jointly by Britain and France.  Furthermore, it is generally believed that the British note will definitely mention the conclusion of a Western European air pact, stressing that this move is an urgent matter that cannot be ignored. Rumors had circulated that the cabinet planned to send Lord Halifax, a minister without portfolio, on a trip to Berlin, but whether this will materialize has not yet been decided.

<h3 id="e46">French Chamber of Deputies to Hold Re-election Today; Left Wing Expected to Win <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The re-election of the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to begin this Sunday (i.e., the 26th). According to general observation, the next Chamber of Deputies will likely be more left-leaning. The Communist Party, which holds twelve seats in the current Chamber, will likely maintain its current position, while the seats held by the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party are certain to increase, although the rate of increase is still unknown. There are a total of 618 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and the total number of candidates is 4,807. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into three factions: The left-wing Popular Front, which includes: A. Communist Party leader Thorez, B. Orthodox Socialist Party leader Léon Blum, C. Radical Socialist Party leader and former Prime Minister Daladier, D. Republican Socialist Union Party leader and Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, E. Social Front leader Pétain. The right-wing National Front, which includes a majority of party groups, the most important of which are: A. Republican Democratic Union Party leader and former Minister without Portfolio Marin, B. Central Republican Party leader and former Prime Minister Tardieu, although Tardieu himself has already retired from parliamentary life. The above-mentioned right-wing parties all have politically-oriented groups as their backing, such as the "Patriotic Youth League" and the "Cross of Fire" (organized by right-wing war veterans).  The central parties, the most important of which are: A. Democratic Alliance Party leader and Foreign Minister Flandin, B. People's Democratic Party, whose power is limited to certain regions where Catholics congregate. In addition to the above-mentioned left, right, and central factions, there are also several small party groups that occupy a portion of political power solely based on the personal prestige of their members. Moreover, among the three factions above, internal discipline within the left wing is far more strict, while candidates from the right and central factions often attack each other due to personal grievances, which hinders the electoral situation. The current election campaign is extremely intense. Communist Party members, because of the internationalism they have long advocated, have found it difficult to win the approval of the general left-wing, so they have changed their tune and are touting patriotism as a rallying cry. As for the right-wing parties, they often use the controversy caused by the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the internal turmoil in Spain after the left-wing victory in the Spanish parliamentary elections as campaign tools. All of these are distinctive features of the election campaign. In addition, in some rural areas, there are still candidates nominated by a majority of agricultural organizations who are advocating plans to protect agriculture and are running for election, but whether they can seize a portion of the seats from the left and right factions is still unknown. According to past practice, candidates who obtain more than half of the votes in the first round of voting (April 26) are elected; otherwise, a second round of voting must be held on May 3, at which time only a relative majority is required to be elected. In general, since the number of candidates listed on the candidate list is so large, the competition will be extremely fierce, so the number of those elected in the first round of voting will not exceed 200. However, the composition of the future Chamber of Deputies should be roughly discernible after the first round of voting. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Lyon: Herriot, former leader of the Radical Socialist Party, delivered a campaign speech last night, defending the financial methods of the party's cabinets over the past four years (Note: The previous Chamber of Deputies was established in May 1932 and completed its term in April 1936, a term of four years), and said that the various cabinets had raised agricultural product prices and the economy was able to recover, the party had made real contribution. Secondly, regarding foreign policy, he said that "France's greatest hope" lies in the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the effective alliance treaty between France and Czechoslovakia. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Valence, France: Daladier, leader of the Radical Socialist Party and former Prime Minister, delivered a campaign speech via radio last night, stating briefly: "We French should coexist with all countries and jointly organize a peace mechanism, regardless of the political systems of other countries. The so-called peace mechanism should aim for collective security and arms limitation." He then spoke about the domestic economy, saying that powerful trusts should be attacked, saying that this kind of combination can monopolize finance and hinder small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, which is actually the political and religious order of the past reappearing in today's economic life. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Deputy Pétain, leader of the left-wing Social Front, recently delivered a campaign speech via radio, stating briefly: "The 38 million people in our country's agricultural, industrial, petty bourgeoisie, and working classes must eliminate their suspicions and unite as one to fight against the despicable and hateful tyrannical system, namely the trusts." Regarding foreign policy, Pétain advocated that France should live peacefully with any country, regardless of its domestic political system, and that peace can be expected by stopping the arms race, establishing a mutual assistance system, and revising existing treaties in accordance with Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant to realize equal rights. Regarding domestic affairs, he said that the Bank of France, colluding with arms dealers, flour merchants, insurance companies, etc., has formed trusts to control politics, which urgently needs to be reorganized to become a public utility. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Colonel de la Rocque, leader of the far-right "Cross of Fire" recently delivered a radio speech, stating briefly: "Now there are those who tout revolutionary doctrines, imitating us, singing the praises of compromise, but in reality, they are partisan and exclusive, and their accumulated mistakes are difficult to reverse. What they advocate is nothing but the aggravation of hatred, and what they claim to be working hard for is nothing but the leading of our country into the abyss of dictatorship. What kind of dictatorship is this? I really cannot bear to say it. Moreover, these people are full of benevolence and morality, but in reality, they are walking hand in hand with the scum and criminals who are hated by the international community to implement a policy of aggression. Why don't you devote your enthusiasm to realizing the beautiful ideals of the 'Cross of Fire'? The dictatorial systems of Fascism, National Socialism, and Bolshevism are all the same in our eyes and are not what we want." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">German Rearmament (Part 1) <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Louis Fischer, translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>The most important question that I hoped to have answered during my stay in Berlin was: would Germany's food and financial panic greatly affect the completion of its military buildup plan? Now I know that the answer is no.</p>
<p>Germany's industrial production has reached a postwar peak. But most of it is neither edible nor wearable. Germany has frozen a large amount of its capital in military supplies. According to experts, there are now three million more people employed than in January 1933—over 750,000 are ordinary employees, over 750,000 are soldiers and sailors, and over 1.5 million are workers; but the amount of goods consumed is still extremely low in proportion. From January 1933 to October 1934, the actual wages of workers and small employees decreased by 25%, and the general decline in the German standard of living under Hitler was about 30% to 35%. If the poor quality of the products is also taken into account, the situation is even worse. Hitler and many newspapers predicted even greater difficulties and sacrifices in 1936. Joseph Winschun said in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung on December 31 of last year: "The level of wages can hardly tolerate further price increases." Goebbels said that wages cannot be increased. However, the lack of food is driving up prices. As Winschun himself said, "Exports must be encouraged, and the standard of living should be reduced for this purpose." There are no promises of relief or improvement for 1936. However, discerning observers, both German and foreign, believe that the production of the German military industry will indeed be greatly intensified in the first six months of 1936, and will only slow down after June due to a severe cash crunch. The technical equipment of the German army—airplanes, artillery, tanks, etc.—will reach its peak in 1936, at which time the army will be fully combat-ready.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, 1936 cannot be said to be the time when Germany's rearmament is complete. National conscription has only just begun, and the ranks of the Reichswehr are not enough to fight a major power. The increased number of officers and staff also lack the effectiveness and knowledge required for modern warfare. The veterans of the European War are old and physically unfit, and their skills are outdated. Germany must wait, waiting for the newly conscripted millions of young people to become soldiers capable of enduring long and arduous wars. But when will this be? Some experts say it will be in 1937, most say it will be in 1938, and some say it will be in 1939. The Reichswehr now has approximately 800,000 officers and soldiers combined, and by 1939, it will have 1 million armed soldiers and 2.5 million reservists, which is enough ammunition and food for a major initial battle.</p>
<p>The main problem is raw materials. The government will try its best to purchase fats from overseas through "clearing agreements," but will also use foreign currency as much as possible to exchange for the import of raw materials. If faced with a blockade or League of Nations sanctions, Germany may not be able to sustain a long-term war due to its limited natural resources. Germany's annual oil consumption is 3.5 million tons, and very little is developed domestically. In many places, although the mines have been dug and oil sprouts have been discovered, the oil wells have been closed, awaiting future development. The synthetic oil manufacturing industry has made astonishing progress. Germany is already able to produce one-third of its annual gasoline consumption, and this could increase to two-thirds in 1938 and 100% in 1939. If private cars on the road disappear, the domestic gasoline production in 1938 will be enough to offset the need for gasoline imports. Germany is now stockpiling large amounts of oil. Friendly countries are helping. The air force needs the highest quality oil, and Germany lacks oil refining technology and experience. Therefore, The American Socony-Vacuum Company recently built a refinery in Hamburg specializing in the refining of aviation oil, which will be completed this year.</p>
<p>Laboratories everywhere are researching substitutes for steel, iron, copper, cotton, and sulfur. The government has scientific records of the industrial uses of all non-ferrous metals. In wartime, these reserves—such as underground telegraph lines—will be used. Germany is also investing in the production of Hungarian soybeans, Yugoslavian bauxite, and Bulgarian tobacco. Of the three million shares in Austria's largest metallurgical plant, Alpine-Montan Company, Germany's Vereinigte Stahlwerke owns 1.7 million shares. Germany is doing this in the hope of obtaining a supply of raw materials from these sources in wartime.</p>
<p>Military orders are the most important food for Germany's heavy industry, and the activities of heavy industry are entirely dominated by military plans. The Opelt car factory in Brandenburg is being built under the supervision of the military. In Germany, there are also ordinary motorcycle factories and the factories of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, which, although American capital, do not allow any Americans to enter; because they manufacture military equipment.</p>
<p>The whole of Germany is a large military camp. People like me who have been away from Germany for a long time can see the increasing number of Wehrmacht soldiers and uniforms. Now, the ordinary military vehicles speeding through the streets of Berlin are disguised. This is one aspect of actual rearmament. But it is also one aspect of psychological rearmament. Speaking of psychological rearmament, it is now being carried out extremely intensely every day and every hour in newspapers, radio broadcasts, and schools.</p>
<p>Germany's psychological mobilization is very important. Every country is openly expanding its military. This phenomenon has become a norm, and no one thinks about the shoes, socks, shirts, bread, meat, butter, medicine, comfort, and happiness that are stolen from tens of millions of people every day. Sometimes people even conclude that humanity, which is trending towards such a crazy state, should have a war to purify itself. Psychological mobilization is stimulating people to accept the impoverished conformity that results from the expansion of armaments. Every government tells its people that armaments are necessary to protect or maintain national prestige and glory. German newspapers often pay tribute to Hitler because his conscription speech on March 16, 1935, restored Germany's pride and confidence. It is said that Germany has concentrated its industrial strength on rearmament for this reason. I do not underestimate the political significance of nationalism and patriotism. But I do not believe that the main goal of the Nazi's military buildup plan is to satisfy this kind of sentiment. There must be other goals. Is it territorial aggression? German politicians deny it, but what else could it be? They protest and deny it, but in fact, Germany's blaming of Bolshevik Russia for launching an invasion attempt is the same as Rome's blaming of Abyssinia for being the aggressor. Germans insist that they are peaceful, and Hitler's several speeches are often cited by Berlin as proof of Germany's deep love of peace. But can objective truth be sought from those who argue vehemently?</p>
<p>Germans have often been known as inept diplomats, because they do not trust diplomacy much and therefore devote little effort to it. They respect strength; they mock empty talk. One day in 1933, Hitler came to power. Poland was shocked. Because in the previous year, the League of Nations had allowed Germany military equality, Warsaw was terrified that an armed Germany ruled by absolute nationalist Nazis would seriously threaten Danzig and the Corridor. Therefore, in March 1933, the late General Piłsudski concentrated five major army corps near the German border and responded to the Anglo-French attempt to launch a war against Fascist Germany. It is said that the then French Chief of Staff Weygand paid great attention to this idea. By April, Polish troops had occupied the narrow strip of Westerplatte in the Danzig area. It looked like war was about to begin. On May 17, 1933, Hitler delivered a lengthy peace speech in the Reichstag, in which he cleverly declared: "A new European war cannot create a situation better than today. ... Germany is always willing to assume further international security obligations. ... Germany is prepared to abolish all its military facilities." Most countries in the world did not know that this promise was intended to ward off an impending war. The Western European powers were naturally happy to hear Hitler's words, because they did not want to fight. Paris also finally rejected Piłsudski's proposed prevention of war.</p>

<p>Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai Denies Signing Anti-Communist Pact, Says Talk of Expanding Japanese Military Presence is Inaccurate, Nagami Also Did Not Discuss North China Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Imai Takeo, military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, has recently established a practice of meeting with Chinese and foreign journalists every Friday. Today (the 24th) was the first such meeting, and many reporters attended, divided into three groups. First, reporters from European and American countries were met, followed by Japanese reporters, and finally Chinese reporters. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Mr. Imai began by telling the reporters, "Today's meeting with you has no real news to report. However, I have heard rumors of a general strike and demonstrations by students in Tianjin, which, thanks to the effective prevention by the local Public Security Bureau, did not materialize. As far as I (Imai referring to himself) can tell, this rumored unrest among Tianjin students was not without manipulation. The student movement in Shanghai last year is a clear example. Furthermore, after the recent incursion of communist bandits into Shanxi, the communist party members lurking in Beiping and Tianjin have been very active and are said to have established a branch in Tianjin responsible for command. Therefore, Japan is particularly concerned about the future security of the two cities. The activities of the Communist Party in North China are not only harmful to China but also have a direct impact on Japan. The North China authorities are currently making progress on the path to reconstruction, and their precautions against the current communist threat are considerable. However, they should go further to eliminate hidden dangers in order to achieve political progress. Today, I read an editorial in a Chinese newspaper that referred to the Communist Party as 'new national traitors' and 'new Chinese collaborators.' I wholeheartedly agree and sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will act accordingly to ensure the tranquility of North China."</p>
<p>At this point, someone asked Imai about the widespread reports in European and American newspapers that China and Japan had signed a joint anti-communist agreement and would expand the Japanese military presence in North China to the Beining, Pinghan, and Pingsui railways. Imai replied, "The above is completely unfounded. Although rumors have been rampant recently, they are all nonsense. The so-called signing of an anti-communist agreement is absolutely untrue. The talk of expanding the area of the Japanese garrison is also absolutely inaccurate. Chief of Staff Nagami recently returned to Japan to attend a division commanders' conference, completed his business, and returned to his post to convey the intentions of the military headquarters. Therefore, I and Major General Matsumuro are preparing to go to Tianjin tomorrow morning to receive a report. Oki, the director of the Zhangjiakou Special Agency, has also been summoned to Tianjin. We will not stay long in Tianjin because the 27th is the day of the memorial service for the war dead, so we must rush back to Beiping before then to preside over the ceremony. As far as I know, Chief of Staff Nagami has not met with the responsible Chinese authorities as of the 22nd. In short, if there is a need for Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians to discuss anti-communism, there is no need for secrecy, and outsiders should not speculate, which only leads to confusion."</p>
<p>Imai continued to discuss the situation of suppressing bandits in Shanxi, saying, "Initially, the situation was very critical, but now it has eased. It is like a patient who was initially in a critical acute condition and has now turned to a chronic one. Recovery will take time, which is to be expected. As for diplomatic negotiations, I have heard nothing so far. The issue of building the Cangshi Road is only mentioned in the newspapers. This may have been a proposal made by the Chinese railway authorities during their inspection in the north some time ago. Now the newspapers are reporting that this matter has been concretized, but I am very skeptical of this statement and cannot believe it. Consul General Kawagoe Mao of Tianjin will be promoted to Chinese ambassador. Kawagoe himself had no prior knowledge of this. I do not know when he will return to Japan for instructions." Finally, when asked about the drug prohibition issue, he said, "I have heard that the efforts to prohibit drugs in various counties of eastern Hebei have been quite successful with the assistance of the Japanese military authorities, and there is a possibility of eliminating them completely. However, the number of opium dens opened by Koreans in Beiping and Tianjin has recently expanded. What are your opinions as a military attaché?" Imai pondered for a moment and replied, "I strongly support the suppression of potent drugs. It is very gratifying that the drug atmosphere in various counties of eastern Hebei is gradually being eliminated. It is necessary to suppress opium dens in Beiping and Tianjin. However, in my opinion, it is necessary to prohibit both selling and buying. I hope that China and Japan will cooperate to achieve success. The policy of prohibiting buying depends on education and law working together." At this point, the reporters took their leave. (24th)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Speech: The Bright Path for the People of Sichuan (Continued) At the Expanded Memorial Week of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters</p>
<p>First, "Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism," which means that the moral qualities of loyalty and bravery are the fundamental requirements for our patriotism. To love and save our country, we must first cultivate the spirit and virtues of loyalty and courage. At the same time, our loyalty and courage must be used to love and save the country and our compatriots, and must be for the public and not for the private, for others and not for oneself. For example, the courage of ordinary bandits who kill and rob, and of those who fear death and are unwilling to face danger, is also a kind of courage. However, this kind of courage is entirely for personal gain and therefore becomes a crime and cannot be considered loyalty and courage. Therefore, the true meaning of loyalty and courage is what the ancients called "devotion to the country," "sacrificing oneself for righteousness," "forgetting oneself for the public, forgetting one's family for the country," and "being brave in public battles and timid in private fights."</p>
<p>Second, "Filial piety is the foundation of managing a family," which means that if we want to make our family harmonious, orderly, and consistent, and create a peaceful and happy family, we must start with being filial to our parents. Because we must fulfill our filial duties, then there will be a distinction between superiors and inferiors, and an order between elders and juniors, so that the affairs of the family can be managed in an orderly manner. Reason can be promoted and magnified.</p>
<p>Third, "Benevolence is the foundation of dealing with things." The so-called "dealing with things" includes interpersonal relations and the handling of affairs. Our standard for dealing with things is "benevolence," which is what the ancients called "benevolence to the people and love for all things." We must love our compatriots, love our friends, and even love humanity and all things in the universe. The so-called "people are our compatriots, and things are our partners," "heaven and earth coexist with us, and all things are one with us," is the spirit of benevolence. If we treat people, deal with affairs, and use things with this great spirit, we will surely be loved by people everywhere, get help from people, and exhaust the resources of things. In this way, one point of our own efforts can produce at least ten points of effect. All the power we receive can become our power and can increase countless times.</p>
<p>Fourth, "Trustworthiness is the foundation of establishing a career." If we want to make a career, we must gain people's trust and help. To gain people's trust and help, we must first have trustworthiness ourselves. In dealing with people, we must first show our faith and morality in practice, so that people will believe us and know that we are not people who are unfaithful, unrighteous, selfish, or afraid of death. We must first have a sense of righteousness and faith, and then people will trust us, and then we can succeed in our careers.</p>
<p>Fifth, "Peace is the foundation of dealing with the world." The so-called "peace" refers to the relationship between people. "Harmony" means loving each other and not having jealousy, suspicion, cursing, fighting, or even fratricide. "Peace" means being fair to each other and not having encroachment, contention, bullying, partiality, or harming others for one's own benefit. There must be fairness in order to have love, and there must be peace in order to deal with the world. Individuals in society must treat others with peace. All our compatriots must love each other. We must be willing to suffer losses ourselves and not take advantage of others. We must know that those who advocate justice and maintain peace will surely achieve ultimate success. Those who suffer small losses in the present will surely gain advantages in the end. Those who take small advantages in the present will surely suffer great losses in the end. All our compatriots must understand this principle and live together in peace. Our first step is to realize the eternal peace of the entire country and create the most peaceful country. The second step is to contribute our Chinese peace to the world and realize universal peace throughout the world. Peace is an inherent virtue of our China. We always advocate peace. However, in order to maintain the survival of the country and the survival of the nation, we must have the ability and determination to defend ourselves. If foreigners want to invade us and oppress us, they are destroying peace and disturbing peace. In order to maintain justice and righteousness, we have no choice but to resist in order to strive for lasting peace. Therefore, when all peaceful means have been exhausted and peace is no longer possible, we can only and must seek independent existence and consolidate peace through means other than peaceful means.</p>
<p>Sixth, "Etiquette is the foundation of managing affairs." This means that if we want to do things well, we must pay attention to etiquette. Because without etiquette, there will be no order in society or in human affairs, and there will be no stability. The relationship between people will be even more chaotic, and nothing can be done. For example, there are more than a thousand people present today. If there is no etiquette, how can we move and act in unison and in an orderly manner? Not to mention the discipline of a large number of people and groups, even individual life and work are the same. The ancients said, "Etiquette is reason," which means that when we live and do things, we must have order, restraint, and proper and reasonable attitudes and rules. When we live and do things, we must pay attention to etiquette at all times, otherwise we cannot be human beings, let alone do things. Therefore, it is said that "without etiquette, there is no way to stand," "etiquette is the management of affairs - gentlemen have their affairs, and they must have their management - without etiquette, there is no place for hands and feet, no place for eyes and ears, no control over advancing and retreating, and no strategy for hunting and military affairs, and no system for military and martial arts." The so-called "etiquette is the foundation of governing the world" in this code of conduct means the same thing.</p>
<p>Seventh, "Obedience is the foundation of responsibility." If we want to make the country rich and strong, the people must be able to assume responsibility and work together. How can this responsibility be fulfilled? How can everyone's work be done with twice the result with half the effort? The most important thing is that, in terms of horizontal relations, we must divide labor and cooperate with each other. In terms of vertical relations, we must have layer-by-layer control and level-by-level obedience. For example, the organization of the government has the central government, the provincial government, the county government, and even the district office. The personnel of the various levels of the army have the commander-in-chief, the commander, the division commander, and even the soldiers at all levels. They must all be controlled from top to bottom and obey level by level from bottom to top. Lower-level agencies or personnel must obey the orders of higher-level agencies or officials in order to do things well and fulfill their responsibilities. The reason why we cannot do everything well in our country and the country has been brought to such a critical state of survival is because people only know how to fight for power and profit, and cannot be responsible and fulfill their duties. Everyone wants to talk about freedom and equality, and does not know the principles of obedience and responsibility. They do not know that if everyone talks about freedom and equality casually, the country and the nation will perish. They do not know that modern citizens should sacrifice their own freedom and equality in order to seek the freedom and equality of the entire country. In the future, if we want to save the country, everyone must be responsible. The fundamental prerequisite for responsibility is that everyone must sacrifice their own freedom and equality, obey the government, obey the law, and obey their superiors in order to fulfill their responsibilities. The government is the organ of the country, the law is the will of the country, and the superior is the representative of the government. Therefore, when we obey our superiors, we are not obeying individuals, but obeying the orders they issue in accordance with national laws. In short, our obedience is obedience to the country, is obedience to our duties, and is obedience to our own responsibilities. Because the country is my own, and the job is also my own. Such obedience is also obedience to myself. If I can obey myself, this is called self-discipline. Anyone who can be self-disciplined will succeed. Therefore, we obey for the country, not for any one person, let alone for private individuals. Therefore, this kind of obedience is glorious, not shameful. Only in this way can we be truly obedient, truly responsible, and worthy of being a modern citizen.</p>
<p>Eighth, "Diligence and thrift are the foundation of service." Heaven and earth and parents gave birth to us, and society and the country educated us to become a person. We must serve society and the country. We ourselves are a part of society and the country, so serving society and the country is serving ourselves. I am for everyone, that is, everyone is for me. This is the first priority of self-help and helping others. Only in this way can life have meaning and value. Where should we start serving society and the country? We must be diligent and thrifty. We must be diligent in order to make contributions, and we must be thrifty in order to have restraint and avoid consumption. In the first aspect, the purpose of our diligence and thrift must be to serve the people. Therefore, if diligence and thrift are for private gain and not for public gain, like those who "get up at the crowing of the rooster and work diligently for profit," this kind of diligence and thrift is of no benefit to the country and the people, and is not true diligence and thrift. We must know that living in modern times, without the entire society, the entire nation, and the entire country, there is no way for one person to be warm if everyone is hungry and cold, and for one person to be happy if everyone is in distress. Therefore, we must establish the ambition of "worrying before others and enjoying after others," and develop the spirit of labor and service. To establish others is to establish ourselves, and to save others is to save ourselves.</p>
<p>Ninth, "Cleanliness is the foundation of self-cultivation." The so-called "self-cultivation" refers to the cultivation of both the inner mind and the body. If we want to cultivate ourselves, we must start with cleanliness. We must be inwardly focused, pure, and clear-minded, and outwardly neat, solemn, clean, and bright. Extending this to the things around us and the environment in which we live, we must make them so. Then we can have a strong body, a noble character, and a brilliant mind. Most people do not know the importance of cleanliness. Even like the famous scholars of the past, they claimed to be unkempt and casual, and falsely called it elegance. We should eliminate and wash away this bad habit and shame. But the cleanliness I am talking about is simple and unadorned, and is absolutely different from luxury and splendor. It is not to ask everyone to wear fine silk of different colors, let alone to ask everyone to use foreign goods. This is luxury, and luxury will lead to the destruction of the country and the decline of the nation. Therefore, cleanliness is close to thrift and simplicity, while luxury is completely opposite.

<p>The case of Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the Shanghai Local Court, and Yang Shaopeng, a lawyer, who were secretly accused to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, was previously investigated by the Procuratorate of the Wuxian Local Court, which prosecuted them for dereliction of duty. The trial was held on the 25th. Lawyers Tan Yanwu, Chao Limian, and Yang Yanlu Dingkui defended them. On the witness side, Sun Zuji, Zhu Yisheng, Gao Junxiang, and Li Shirui (deceased) were summoned. Only Zhu Yisheng and Gao Junxiang appeared in court. The trial began at 2:50 p.m. in the third courtroom, with Judge Yu Zhong presiding. Prosecutor Zhu Shufen also attended to perform his duties. After Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng were briefly interrogated, Prosecutor Zhu Shufen stood up and stated the intent of the prosecution. Judge Yu said that the court term for this case was very near, and the summoned witnesses had not arrived in full. He would first interrogate those who had reported. The witness was first interrogated:</p>
<p>Zhu Yisheng testified:</p>
<p>35 years old, from Shanghai, a Chan master. He performed his duties in 1933. He did not know Yang Shaopeng, and he did not have a clear memory of the year before last. He did not know Tan Zhuohong. The official discussed the witness's status with Prosecutor Zhu and ordered him to sign a statement. Zhu also testified that in the case of Qin Zhengru, the owner of the Haizhou ship, who was accused of causing death by negligence, a waiter from the Datong Company found Wu Zhikuan, the ship's mate, and said that if money was not paid, the case would be sentenced to three years in prison. This was what Qin Zhengru told me, indicating that a decision had not yet been made. I did not pay attention to him. In the case of Lei Yunsheng suing Wang Bingnan for counterfeiting trademarks, I was the agent of civil litigation. The case was tried by Tan Zhuohong. Wang Bingnan was released on bail in the first hearing. Later, Yang Shaopeng came to my office and said that Tan Zhuohong told you not to worry about the Qin Zhengru case, saying that things were bad because of someone named Gong. Now, in the Lei Yunsheng case, Tan Zhuohong said that if you paid some money, you could get a satisfactory result. I immediately rejected him and did not ask him what his relationship was with Tan Zhuohong. Later, Yang called again and said that 1,000 yuan would be enough, but I refused again. The first time they asked for 2,000 yuan. Because I did not believe that the court would do such a thing, I did not ask much. At the end of the debate, he called again and said that he would give me one last chance and that at least 400 yuan would be enough. I did not agree. I had talked about this with Lei Yunsheng in some detail. I do not know anyone named Gong. I have no ill intentions towards Tan and Yang.</p>
<p>Gao Junxiang testified:</p>
<p>36 years old, from Jinshan, lives in Shanghai, a lawyer. He knew Yang Shaopeng from childhood, but they did not associate with each other, and he had no bad feelings towards him. In the case of Wu Peizhen suing Li Keting, I was the defense lawyer. As a result, the criminal court did not accept the case. At first, it was handled by Judge Tan Zhuohong, but I don't know who handled it later. I appeared in court once for the second hearing. In ten days, the defendant posted a bail of 1,000 yuan. I immediately asked to replace it with a shop guarantee, but because it was late that day, I did not have time to find a guarantor. The next day, I found a guarantor, but Judge Tan suddenly summoned the guarantor. Later, the family called me and said that Judge Tan told the guarantor that he had to assume a responsibility of 10,000 yuan, so the guarantor refused to guarantee. I was very surprised, so I went to the court to ask Judge Tan what was going on. Judge Tan said, "I'll tell you tomorrow." At that time, the family went to hire Lawyer Lu to handle the case. The next day, Yang Shaopeng came and asked if I had any opinions on this case. I said no. At that time, Lawyer Lu arrived and said that the case should not have been accepted at all, and the detention was ridiculous. Yang Shaopeng listened and said nothing, and then left. At that time, Yang did not call Judge Tan, but I heard Yang say that he was going to talk to Judge Tan. There was nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Yang Shaopeng testified:</p>
<p>I was introduced to Tan Zhuohong by Chen Hanshi and Chen Zongfu last spring in Shanghai. Tan admired Zhang Shizhao's morality and writing and asked Chen Hanshi to introduce him to Zhang's door. Zhang agreed to introduce a friend, and we had dinner at Zhang's house. There were four of us. In the case of Zhang Qidong et al. suing Song Dawei for defamation, I remember that Sun Zuji, a teacher, came to invite me. After I went, he called the waiter and then asked me if I knew Tan Zhuohong. I asked him what he meant. He said, "If you don't know him, then forget it." He looked unhappy. I took my leave. I didn't say that I wanted to think of a way to get the defendant to pay a considerable price for this case. I haven't known Zhu Yisheng for long. Last summer, I met him at the court for a railway case. I went to his office. I don't remember the date. He invited me and told me that he was handling a case of Lei Yunsheng suing Wang Bingnan for counterfeiting trademarks and wanted to ask me to find a way for Judge Tan to order the defendant to pay 30,000 yuan in compensation. I didn't agree, so he resented me. He made false accusations because his coercion failed. I am a classmate of Gao Junxiang. In the Wu Peizhen case, Lawyer Lu said that spouses could not sue each other, so I called Zhang Shizhao to ask for Tan Zhuohong's phone number. I called Tan and told him to handle the case carefully and not to be sloppy and to refer to the law. I wrote a letter to Lawyer Gao, asking him to speak with conscience. In the Li Zhizhi case, I wrote the petition for three days. If I could plead with the court, why would I have worked so hard to write the petition?</p>
<p>Tan Zhuohong testified:</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Qidong suing Song Dawei for defamation was handled by me. The defendant, Ning Dawei, was wanted because his whereabouts were unknown. I had been in Shanghai for a short time. I probably met Yang Shaopeng once at Zhang Shizhao's house. I didn't ask Yang Shaopeng to meet Zhang Shizhao. Chen Zhongfu's house had also been visited. There were no other friends. I knew Zhang Shizhao in Beijing in 1916. I didn't ask Yang Shaopeng to pay Zhang Shizhao as my leader. I didn't ask Yang Shaopeng to say that I wanted money in the Zhang Qidong case. The case of Qin Zhengru of the Haizhou ship was also handled by me. He was sentenced to three years in prison. I forgot how the High Court ruled on the appeal. The Lei Yunsheng case was handled by me. I forgot how Wang Bingnan was sentenced for counterfeiting trademarks. I didn't ask Yang Shaopeng to ask Qin Zhengru for money, and I didn't ask Yang to talk to Lei Yunsheng in the Wang Bingnan case about finding a solution. After the debate, I reopened the debate because the prosecution added another defendant. I went to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Because the case was important, I reopened the debate, not to leave a chance to get money, but to reopen the debate.</p>

<p>Covering Up for Gu Zhuxuan's Smoking, Two Wardens Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>Ma Qinan Road Second Special District Prison warden Jia Furong and warden Ren Wu, formerly assigned to the inmate ward (i.e., Guangci Hospital) to perform their duties, were accused of covering up for and instigating convicted murderer Gu Zhuxuan to smoke opium inside. This was reported by inmates Li Heshang and Wang A'er. Upon investigation by Ouyang Sen, the head of the Second Section of the prison, opium residue, heroin, and opium pipes were found. A request was submitted to the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, Prosecutor Wang Ren determined that Jia and Wu were indeed covering up for opium smoking. Consequently, they were prosecuted in the Criminal Court for dereliction of duty. After interrogation by Judge Wang Gangxu, the debate concluded. Details were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, at 2:45 PM, Judge Wang convened the Third Criminal Court, ordering the defendants Jia and Wu to appear. The verdict was as follows: Jia Furong and Wu Lu are each sentenced to five years of imprisonment for covering up opium smoking, with five years of deprivation of civil rights. The confiscated opium residue, etc., are to be confiscated. After the verdict, both defendants requested bail, which was denied by the court. They were taken back into custody. If dissatisfied, they have ten days to appeal after receiving the judgment.</p>

<p>Hao Yongchuan, also known as Hao Peiran, a 47-year-old Henan native, made a living by selling counterfeit bills for profit. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4 PM, Hao, carrying two books, "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Eastern Zhou Dynasties," went to the North Station to take a train out of Shanghai. Officer Miao Hongbin found his behavior suspicious, checked him, and found 180 counterfeit Central Bank five-yuan bills and 12 counterfeit Bank of China five-yuan bills, totaling 963 yuan, concealed within the two books. The suspect was taken to the North Station branch for questioning. Hao gave evasive and dishonest answers. The police department, considering the case involved disrupting the financial system and criminal charges, prepared a document to transfer the case to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Abbot of Xuedou Temple, Miaohui, Sexually Assaults Female Servant; Mrs. Lu Liu Unaware of Pregnancy, Mistakenly Believes She is Ill; Abortion of Fetus After Diagnosis by Langqing <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Lu Liu, a 37-year-old woman from Wenzhou, was employed as a maid at the Xuedou Temple branch at 493 Dongyouheng Road since last October. The abbot of the temple, Miaohui, a native of Hunan, harbored malicious intentions. On the night of the 25th of that month, he used hypnotism to make her lose consciousness and sexually assaulted her. After Mrs. Lu realized what had happened, she confronted him. The monk threatened to fire her. Later, because there were many observers within the temple, he pretended to dismiss her but actually rented a house for them to live together outside. In January of this year, Mrs. Lu suddenly felt unwell and frequently vomited. She asked Langqing, a monk in the temple with medical knowledge, to diagnose her. He diagnosed her with a cold and cough and prescribed medicine. After taking the medicine, she aborted something resembling a fetus, and only then did she realize she had been deceived. Recently, she hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to sue Miaohui and Langqing for offenses against public morals at the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the Eighth Criminal Court for questioning. The defendants hired lawyer Hong Tuhao for defense, arguing that Mrs. Lu had committed adultery with Lin Xingbo, the temple's accountant, when Miaohui left Shanghai. Miaohui discovered this and dismissed her, and then Mrs. Lu cohabitated with Lin at 310 Donghan Bili Road. Lin was later dismissed for other reasons, leading to this case. Judge Liu declared the hearing closed to the public because the case involved public morals, so the details of the hearing are unknown. The result was a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Haiyi and Maller Collide While Sailing to Beiyang; Details Awaiting Confirmation <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Haiyi, a steamship owned by a local Chinese shipping company, is currently leased to the Datong Transportation Association for cargo transportation between the North and South Seas and Japan. This time, the Ruishi Weile, owned by the British trading company Jiazi in Shanghai, set sail from Qinhuangdao after loading coal and collided with the Haiyi. The extent of the damage is still under investigation. It is generally known that the Maller's hull was damaged in the collision but does not affect navigation. The Chinese shipping company has not yet received a telegram regarding the Haiyi, so the details are unknown. A telegram has been sent for inquiry.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Hongzhang Cotton Mill Doctor Jin Jianming Arrested; Questioning Girlfriend Led to Gun Threat; Detained and Sent to Court; Hearing Postponed for Further Investigation <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Jin Jianming, a doctor from Jiangsu working at the Hongzhang Cotton Mill on Maigen Road, was suddenly arrested by detectives from the Yulin Road Police Department on the afternoon before yesterday. A handgun and 21 bullets were found. He was detained in the police department. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The Public Works Department lawyer Jiang Baolian filed charges of obstructing freedom under Article 305 of the criminal law, stating that the police department acted on a report from Chen Peiming, the principal of Huacheng School at 42 Lane 376, Dalianwan Road, that the defendant Jin Jianming, along with Liu Zhidong, had visited the school to inquire about Ma Channing, asking about the whereabouts of Wang Shaohan and his wife Liu Xiulan. According to Ma, Wang and his wife had been arrested by the Public Security Bureau on suspicion of being communists but were released on bail and had returned to Luoyang, Henan. However, the defendant did not believe this and insisted on taking Ma Channing to 30 Shude Lane, Dalianwan Road, Wang and his wife's former residence. When they arrived and found that Wang had indeed left, the defendant suddenly became angry, took out a handgun from his suit pocket, loaded it, pointed it at Ma Channing, and demanded the truth. While they were arguing, the landlord Bai Jinwen intervened and persuaded him to put away the gun. The defendant then forced Ma to take a car to the Jing'an Temple Road post office and forced Ma to send a telegram to Luoyang, urging Wang and his wife to return to Shanghai quickly. Ma had no choice but to comply and was then released. The day before yesterday, Ma received several phone calls from the defendant, urging Ma to go to Luoyang to find Liu Xiulan. Ma agreed and told the defendant to come to the school to discuss it yesterday. Ma then reported it to the police department. However, Ma suddenly received a telegram from Wang and his wife in Luoyang, stating their reasons for not being able to come to Shanghai, so when the defendant went to Huacheng School yesterday, he was arrested by detectives. According to the defendant's statement to the police department, he knew Liu Xiulan well and had a deep friendship with her. He had not seen her for over a year. Because Ma Channing was related to Liu, he went to inquire about her. He also led the detectives to the doctor's office in the Hongzhang Cotton Mill and found the gun and ammunition. The case is still under investigation because the accomplices have not been apprehended, and the gun and ammunition have not been examined. The defendant requested a postponement. The defendant Jin Jianming hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him in court. Judge Yang ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>The Special District Rickshaw Pullers' Association petitioned the Party and government agencies yesterday and sent a letter to rickshaw merchants requesting that mutual aid fees for this month be deposited in a bank. Party and government agencies conferred yesterday on the organization of the Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association. The Public Works Department is scheduled to meet with rickshaw merchants on the 30th of this month to resolve all pending issues. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Petition</p>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Pullers' Association of this city, to request that Party and government agencies thoroughly investigate the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association and prepare to initiate the Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association, sent Zhou Weigao, Xia Huaixian, Ma Taizhi, Lu Deguang, Dai Rugui, Yang Xingyou, and others, nine people in total, to petition the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Zhu Yangwu represented the City Party Headquarters in receiving them, and Wang Gang, the director of the Labor Welfare Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, received them. After clarifying the points of the petition, they expressed their acceptance and promised to take action and study the matter. Regarding the organization of the Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association, it was decided to implement it in the near future. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Establishing Welfare Association</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers' Association requested Party and government agencies to organize a Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association to handle welfare matters for rickshaw pullers, which has been approved by the authorities. Zhu Yangwu, the clerk of the Civil Affairs Section of the City Party Headquarters, and Wang Gang, the director of the Labor Welfare Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the organization of the Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association, aiming to establish it in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Official-Merchant Meeting</p>
<p>According to news from the Public Works Department yesterday, the rickshaw dispute in the Public Concession had previously come to a temporary end. However, to resolve all pending issues, the authorities of the Public Works Department found it necessary to continue negotiations with rickshaw merchants. These negotiations have recently been scheduled for Thursday, April 30, at 9:45 AM at the Public Works Department. Regarding the selection of attendees for the meeting from the rickshaw merchants, the Rickshaw Association held a joint meeting last night and officially determined their representatives, who will base their negotiations on the resolutions of the general membership meeting.</p>
<p>Requesting Return of Association Fees</p>
<p>Rickshaw lessors Shao Zhencai, Qin Jianzhou, Fu Huanzhang, Yuan Guilin, Zhu Deyao, etc., jointly sent a letter to the Rickshaw Association, stating that in order to correct errors, they had, in March, followed the central government's orders and the principles and organizational law of the Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association drafted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and requested guidance from Party and government agencies. To resolve the dispute as soon as possible, the association continued to collect mutual aid fees for April on behalf of the members. As the Public Works Department seemed not to be coercing donations as in the past, it should deposit the fees in a bank for safekeeping or return them to the rickshaw pullers and not hand them over without authorization, pending disposition by the Party and government. Rickshaw puller representatives Xia Huaixiang, Zhou Weigao, etc., also requested the return of this month's mutual aid fees, saying that the rickshaw puller directors violated the wishes of the public and withdrew from the association, so their words and deeds should not be considered representative.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Xue Tingfang Delivers Threatening Letter; Demands Extortion of 500 Yuan; Telephone Negotiation Betrays Accent; Detectives Wait and Arrest Him <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yanling, the director of the Commercial Press at 200 Guizhou Road, a native of Shaoxing, received a threatening letter from a gang on the 22nd of this month, intending to extort 500 yuan, and arranged to pay the money at 8 PM that night in a room opened by Dong Cheng at the Dahua Hotel on French Avenue, or else his son would be dealt with using a gun. Chen sent someone to the agreed location, but they returned without meeting anyone. On the morning of the 23rd, Chen received another letter, again arranging to pay the money at the original location that night. Chen reported this to the Lao Zha Police Department, which ordered detectives to wait at the Dahua Hotel, but again, there were no results. At 1:30 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, Chen suddenly received a phone call from someone claiming to be Dong Cheng, discussing the payment, saying that the money had to be picked up at 8 PM that night, but Chen recognized the accent as that of Xue Tingfang, a Shaoxing native who often did business with the bookstore. To confirm this, he asked his colleague Dong Chengde to listen, and Dong also confirmed that it was Xue's accent without a doubt. Chen immediately reported this to the police department, and Detective Chief Zhang Yuanjing and detectives Feng Xiushan, Sun Dafa, and Zhang Yi went to wait around the bookstore. At 7:10 PM, Xue Tingfang indeed arrived, offering to sell two boxes of carbon paper to Chen, and Chen was just about to hand over the money to test his intentions when the detectives stepped forward and arrested Xue, taking him back to the police department. Xue was found to live at 4 Longzhi Lane, Kang Nai Road, and worked as a clerk at the Yizhong Tobacco Company, earning 53 yuan a month. He had previously sold carbon paper to the plaintiff's shop. At first, Xue completely denied threatening Chen Yanling. The detectives then separated the plaintiff and Xue into the Bao Detective Room and the Questioning Room. The Bao Detective Room called the Questioning Room and ordered Xue to talk to Chen. Chen confirmed that the accent on the phone at 1:30 PM that afternoon was the same as Xue's. Xue then admitted that he had ordered a letter-writing stall to write the threatening letter. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the circumstances and filed charges under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, also stating that because of the rain yesterday, the letter-writing stall could not be found, so he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Chen Yanling then testified about receiving the letter and phone call. The defendant Xue Tingfang then completely denied everything. Judge Feng Shide examined the evidence and ordered the case to be postponed for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e58">American Botanist Mr. Lu Speaks on Strange Sights of Antarctic Exploration; Coldest Climate Reaches 72 Degrees Below Zero; Greatest Reward is the Grand Beauty of Natural Forces <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that Mr. Lewis Sorsen, a renowned American botanist and member of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, recently arrived in Shanghai with his wife and will stay for a few days before touring the Yangtze River and then lingering in North China for several weeks, eventually circumnavigating the globe. Yesterday, Mr. Lu briefly discussed his experiences in Antarctic exploration with guests. He said that the entire team consisted of 55 people and stayed in the "White Hell" for about twenty months. He and Mr. Rupert set off for Little America on October 13, 1933. The team first went to New Zealand and then reached the east side of Little America in December for several aerial reconnaissance missions inland. In early January 1934, they reached the Little America base and set up tents. The shelters built during the previous expedition were still in good condition but needed some repairs. The supply ship "Walker Run Bear" unloaded the necessary supplies and sailed back to Wellington. The team then prepared for a long march. As a botanist in the team, he and several others studied extremely small shrimp-like creatures and mosses that lived in the salty water of the region. He remained with the team until it returned to New Zealand on its way back to America. The journey was fraught with difficulties, as detailed in the book by Byrd and others, so I will not repeat them. Living in the Antarctic during the "Long Night" is unbearable unless one completely changes one's lifestyle. The loneliness of being holed up all day is unbearable for the living. Fortunately, there are many things to do. Sometimes, we work in shifts day and night. The team members engaged in technical affairs are especially busy, and the managers who send moneyless telegrams every night have no spare time. One person is responsible for editing news and writing weekly broadcast messages. For me personally, the greatest reward for staying there is the magnificent beauty of the natural forces around us. For two weeks each month, we live in darkness, seeing only moonlight. This scenery is deeply impressive. The moonlight is almost as bright as sunlight, without the dazzling glare. The light can illuminate miles. The coldest climate the team encountered was in August and September. One day, the thermometer dropped to 72 degrees below zero. At this time, the team members could not hear their own breathing. The breath froze almost immediately upon touching the face. The cold wind was especially fearsome, and fighting against it was extremely difficult. The moonlight and scenery are a sufficient reward for the loneliness, and the "Antarctic Lights" are especially lovely. They can often be seen on clear nights. Their beauty is indescribable.</p>

<p>Zhu Jinbao, a 20-year-old woman from Pinghu, lost her father early and came to Shanghai with her sisters due to poverty. She worked as a weaver in a sock factory in Lujiabang, Nanshi, earning 8 to 9 yuan per month, barely enough to live on. Among her sisters, there was a male relative named Zhu Baoshun, a 22-year-old from Jingjiang. Seeing that Jinbao was alone and unmarried, he developed lustful thoughts. Half a month ago, he used sweet words to lure her to the Renhe Hotel in Xiejiao and had intercourse with her in a room overnight. The woman, having lost her virginity for the first time, was ashamed and did not want to pursue the matter. Unexpectedly, Zhu told his friend Zhang Heshang. Later, on the night before last (the 24th), he tricked her to the North Railway Station, intending to take her back to Jiangyin and give her to Zhang as his wife. The woman saw through the plan and handed him over to the police at the North Station Police Station. After questioning, the police determined that the case involved sexual assault and abduction and transferred the man and woman to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Recent News from Lun Chang Textile Money Flower Company; Laundry Picture as a Mark, Never Fading; Three-Yard Cheongsam Material Sells for Only One Yuan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Lun Chang Textile Dyeing and Printing Company, founded in Shanghai ten years ago, started when China's printing industry was still in its infancy. The company was the first to adopt the latest machinery and set up a factory near the Dalae Wharf in Pudong to undertake printing business. Because of its excellent products, it was extremely popular in all sectors, and its business grew day by day. In 1934, the company, in response to social needs, invested heavily in establishing a large-scale textile factory in Pudong to produce its own cloth. From raw cotton to printing, the company did everything itself, from spinning and weaving to dyeing and printing, without relying on outside sources. At present, the factory employs thousands of workers, who work day and night, and the demand is still greater than the supply. Furthermore, the company, seeing that various printed fabrics sold on the market faded easily and lost the trust of the general public, specially launched a variety of laundry-picture-printed fabrics. These fabrics have bright colors and will not fade for a long time. Even after being exposed to the sun and washed in water, the company guarantees that they will never fade. A small laundry picture guarantee label is affixed to the edge of each piece of fabric every two yards apart for identification. If the color is found to fade within four months of purchase, the faded fabric can be returned to the company for a free exchange, ensuring customer satisfaction. The company also specially manufactures a variety of inexpensive, high-quality, never-fading printed fabrics. These products are durable, brightly colored, and beautifully designed, making them ideal for making summer clothes for women and children. It is said that a three-yard cheongsam material costs only about one yuan in national currency. This price is unprecedented in Shanghai. Yong'an, Sincere, Xinxin, Lihua, Luo, Ailianhui Trading Company, and major cotton shops in this city and other places all sell these products.</p>

This factory inspection by key central officials is of great significance. Mr. Huang presented a report on the factory's struggles over the past ten years. Although there are no outstanding achievements, the factory's produced thumbtacks can be sold throughout the country, and imported thumbtacks have long disappeared. Unfortunately, it is unable to export them overseas, and business cannot be fully expanded. If the government can refund the raw material tax, there is also the possibility of exporting to Southeast Asia. Commissioner Cen promised to plan and assist, and Huang expressed his gratitude.</p>

<p>Children's Supplement of Shen Bao, Reading Living Books, Xie Yun. Little friends! Now the spring sunshine is bright, and it is time for your happy travels. You go from the "narrow cage" of school to the school of nature. The myriad of phenomena will overwhelm you. This is the nature school of reading living books. What is a living book? Life! Little friends, do not forget to educate yourselves, and always seek knowledge from your lives. Schools and books, teachers, are just helpers to guide you. In the end, you still need to work hard yourself to gain true knowledge. Everything under the sky and on the earth is a book. Whether you see a plant or an animal, you must observe it carefully and study it earnestly. You can gain all kinds of useful knowledge. Your eyes should always be observing, and your minds should always be thinking! Why could Watt invent the steam engine by paying attention to the lid of a boiling kettle? Why could Newton invent the law of universal gravitation by paying attention to the falling apple? They were both able to read living books, and thus invent such useful new things. Little friends, you must absolutely not only read books with black words on white paper, you must also read living books in order to gain truly useful knowledge, so that you can invent new things like Watt and Newton.</p>
<p>Hiding the Beard in the Sleeve, Schoolteacher. In autocratic times, once a person became a high official, they would put on airs, and every action had to be pretentious and domineering, losing all the free and easy fun. But first-rate, capable people would never be willing to abandon their original nature. So, in their spare time, they would privately travel in disguise to investigate the real situation of society, so as not to be deceived by their subordinates.</p>
<p>When Zeng Guoquan was the Governor-General of Liangjiang, he was already over sixty years old. He often dressed up as a countryman and went around playing. Once, he told his staff member to wear ordinary cloth clothes; he himself wore a felt hat and a short jacket with wide sleeves. In the middle of the night, they went out of Nanjing city, climbed Lion Mountain, and went all the way to the military camp in Xiaguan to take a look. The soldiers and generals in the camp were all asleep. They went to the kitchen and ate some melons and fruits to quench their thirst. Then they went to the pier to enjoy the moon.</p>
<p>It happened that a steamship was coming upstream, and the two of them pretended to be ordinary passengers and took the ship to Hankou. They stayed in a small inn for two days, and then crossed the river to Wuchang. It happened that Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Huguang, was holding a military parade. The generals ascended the platform, looking very majestic. Zeng Guoquan also mingled in the crowd and watched from the side. Because his beard was very long, he held one hand up to his chin and tucked his beard into his sleeve, so as not to be recognized. After having a great time, he quietly returned to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Just imagine, what a calm, alert, and humorous high official he was!</p>
<p>The Rubber Ball and the Hot Water Bottle, Chen Tiewu.</p>

<p>Jump a few times,</p>
<p>Pat it hard,</p>
<p>Jumps high.</p>
<p>Unlike us Chinese,</p>
<p>Who don't resist when whipped.</p>
<p>A hot water bottle,</p>
<p>Is really good,</p>
<p>After a long time,</p>
<p>The warm water is still not cold,</p>
<p>Unlike us Chinese,</p>
<p>Who only need five minutes,</p>
<p>And a belly full of enthusiasm is gone.</p>
<p>Float and Sink, Zhen.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Min'er was studying alone. He first reviewed nature and read the lesson on submarines. In addition to what the book told him, he had even more questions outside the book. As soon as he had a question, he couldn't figure it out himself, so he went to ask his father and brother, not hiding anything in his mind, and only stopped when he asked clearly. Therefore, his knowledge progressed very quickly, and his father and brother were also very willing to answer him.</p>
<p>"Brother, submarines are very large ships, how can they float up and down, and be controlled by people's wishes?"</p>
<p>"Isn't there an air tank inside the submarine? The air tank is filled with a lot of air. If you want to make the submarine sink, then use a pump to push water into the air tank. You know that air has a kind of compressibility, turning a lot of air into an extremely small volume. Once the water enters, the air is compressed by the water. Thus, the weight of water is added to the submarine, so the submarine gradually sinks. If you want it to float up, then open the air tank opening to let the water flow out. At that time, the compressed air has a kind of expansion force, pushing the water out. The submarine becomes lighter, and then floats to the surface."</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand, brother, can you explain it again?"</p>
<p>"Don't understand? Okay, I'll tell you something very simple: you've seen crucian carp, right? It can float up from the bottom of the water, and then sink down from the surface of the water. Have you ever seen it? The principle of how it floats and sinks is the same as that of a submarine. It has a kind of swim bladder in its belly? This bladder is divided into a front chamber and a rear chamber. If it wants to float to the surface, then it spits out the water in the swim bladder, the air in the swim bladder expands, the fish's body becomes lighter, and it floats up. If it wants to sink, it eats more water into the swim bladder, the fish's body becomes heavier and it sinks."</p>
<p>"Brother, if it wants to float its head up and sink its tail down, then how does it do it?"</p>
<p>"If it wants to float its head up and sink its tail down, it just needs to add more water to the rear chamber of the swim bladder, and keep the front chamber free of water. Thus, the front chamber is lighter than the rear chamber, so the fish's head floats up and the fish's tail sinks down. Conversely, then the fish's tail will float up and the fish's tail will sink down."</p>
<p>Simple Darts, Bai Yi.</p>
<p>Little friends, I think you may have wanted to make a dart for a long time, right? Now let me tell you a method to make a simple dart: first take a slightly larger olive branch, and flatten the two pointed ends until there are several small holes at each end. (Small holes will definitely appear after grinding to a certain extent). Then take two or three long chicken feathers, and carefully insert them into the holes at one end; then take a steel needle and insert it into the holes at the other end, to the extent that it is stable and not easy to fall out. In this way, a pair of simple and fun little darts are made. You only need to throw it very lightly and it can be stably nailed to a wooden board or other loose materials.</p>
<p>Then, you can invite a few friends to compete to see who gets the most points by throwing darts at a target. You can also divide into two groups to compete, and you can also come up with new tricks to play. However, you have to be careful, don't aim at people like this: "shoot"!</p>
<p>Scientific Knowledge, The Reason Why You Can't Catch Your Breath, Zhang Yian.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of air to people, right? Not eating for two or three days is not a big deal, but losing consciousness for ten minutes without breathing. Why? Because we need the oxygen in the air for nutrition every second. If the supply of oxygen stops, the blood in our bodies will stop flowing, the heart will lose its function, and life will be in danger.</p>
<p>When we move and walk, we need to use muscles. When muscles are used, they need more blood and oxygen for nutrition; the more vigorous the exercise, the more blood and oxygen nutrition is needed. Therefore, our breathing also becomes more rapid, and the heart also beats faster (because the heart is the central organ for transporting blood).</p>
<p>Sometimes, if the degree of vigorous exercise is too excessive, and the speed of your breathing cannot keep up with the nutrition needed by the muscles, you will have soreness and fatigue, and at the same time, you will not be able to catch your breath. If people with weak hearts force themselves to do strenuous exercise, then the heart's action will be too fast, to the extent that their hearts cannot handle it, and there is also a danger of losing their lives.</p>
<p>In sports fields or ball game fields, you often see some little friends trying to win the championship, forcing themselves to do exercises that they cannot handle, which is really worrying. The quality of sports performance depends entirely on consistent and effective daily practice. It cannot be achieved quickly in ten or eight days, and it cannot be won with one burst of effort. Even if you win, it will not only be useless to the body, but also harmful. Cautious schools must first ask a qualified doctor to examine the students' physical condition before determining whether they can learn a certain sport.</p>
<p>Continuous Story (Part 1), You Jian.</p>
<p>Still Belongs to Me!</p>
<p>Fei'er snatched Rong'er's bag of sweets and ran away in a hurry.</p>
<p>He wanted to escape to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the fourth stone was a large turtle.</p>
<p>The turtle swam back to this side, Fei'er had no choice but to return the bag of sweets to him. Rong'er smiled and said, "Good! It still belongs to me!"</p>
<p>Don't Leave Your Schoolbag in School, Yushu.</p>
<p>Little friends often leave their schoolbags locked in the desks in the school in order to be convenient. This is a bad habit.</p>
<p>When we study, it is not enough to only attend classes in school for a few hours. All homework must be reviewed and studied at home. If you leave your schoolbag in school, and put all your books in your schoolbag, then what will you read at home at night? Even if you put a part of the books in your schoolbag, you must know that the school curriculum changes every day. You still have to take it when you need it the next day. Otherwise, you will definitely shout that you forgot to bring the book when class starts!</p>
<p>A schoolbag is not inconvenient to carry in your hand, and it is more troublesome to leave it in school. Little friends must have made this bad habit. You should reform it from today, and schools and families should try to correct it when they encounter this situation!</p>

<p>Electric Bell, Jing Tian.</p>
<p>Dear little friends! You have probably all seen electric bells; but do you know why when you press the protruding button in the small round wooden box (Figure 1) installed outside the door, the cone inside the leaf door rings?</p>
<p>Today I will discuss this issue with all of you little friends.</p>
<p>(The following picture is viewed horizontally, do not want the grid) Figure 1, Figure 2.</p>
<p>The electric bell is the simplest application of an electromagnet (Note 1). Its structure is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>In the figure, A is an electromagnet, B is the bell, C is a soft iron piece, D is a spring, attached to the soft iron piece, E is a hammer, one end connected to the soft iron piece, F is a nail, G, H are two metal pieces, I is a battery, and P is a button.</p>
<p>When I press the button outside the door, the two metal pieces touch each other, and the current passes through the electromagnet. The electromagnet then generates magnetism, thus attracting the soft iron piece in front. The hammer strikes the bell to make a sound once; at the same time, the contact point between the spring and the nail is separated, the current is interrupted, the electromagnet loses its magnetism, and the soft iron piece returns to its original position due to the spring force. The spring then contacts the nail again, the circuit is connected again, and the hammer strikes the bell again; because the time it takes for the spring to bounce back and the circuit to reconnect is extremely short, it is difficult for us to hear it. Therefore, if you do not release the button, the bell will continue to ring.</p>
<p>Note: Wind enameled wire, yarn-covered wire, etc., which are covered conductive wires, onto a pig iron rod in a spiral shape, and pass an electric current through the two ends. Then the pig iron rod becomes a magnet due to induction.</p>
<p>What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future, Wang Dequan, Nanjing Municipal Xujiaxiang Elementary School. (Thirteenth Place)</p>
<p>Now the world powers, because their science is developed and production is surplus, not only do their own people use it, but they can also sell it abroad, absorbing the money of other countries. If a country with backward science, in this era of the survival of the fittest, absolutely has no independent existence.</p>
<p>Our country is an ancient country of East Asian civilization, and it is also a country that has been oppressed and invaded, and it is also a country with backward science. Some of the people are unwilling to humbly study science. All production relies on labor, so the output is very small, the value is very expensive, and the time is not economical. There are not enough goods for the people to use, so they have to buy from foreign countries. Therefore, large amounts of money flow out of the country, making the country poor and exhausted, with internal troubles and external disasters, and the people are miserable. Everything is oppressed, and the land is gradually lost, and the people often suffer disasters. It is all because of backward science. If this continues and is not remedied as soon as possible, not only will the lost land not be recovered, but even the country and nation may be difficult to preserve.</p>
<p>I hold a very grand and optimistic ambition, hoping to become a famous scientist in the future, in order to invent science and promote the progress of Chinese society. I believe that science and the country have a close relationship. Now only science can save China. Holding this determined ambition, in my study years, I will develop the habit of studying science, exploring scientific principles, hoping to make some inventions, and also teach my scientific thoughts to the people, so that the people of the whole country have scientific knowledge, creating a scientific country, restoring the people's happiness, revitalizing the country's industry, and recovering the country's lost land. In this way, the country will not perish, and the historical national humiliation will also be washed away cleanly.</p>
<p>The Tale of the Righteous Dog (16), Xin Qing.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>That night, old Dashi lay on the bed frame in the corner of the wall and said, "Today is little Ailuo's naming day, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Little Nanluo made a gesture, answering his grandfather's question, he was very willing for the old man to forget about this matter and not mention it again. Old Dashi insisted on saying; "Why didn't you go to their house? Nanluo, you used to go every year."</p>
<p>Little Nanluo lowered his head and said softly on his grandfather's bed, "You are so sick, I can't leave you."</p>
<p>Old Dashi quickly said; "No need! No need! Grandma Follet will come to accompany me, it has happened many times before. Nanluo, why don't you go after all? Could it be that you had a quarrel with that outsider Doubei?"</p>
<p>Little Nanluo's face flushed red, and he quickly replied, "No, grandfather—nothing like that, it's really because Mr. Ke Ershi didn't invite me this year. He seems to be dissatisfied with me."</p>
<p>"But have you done anything wrong?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. I just drew a portrait of little Ailuo on a pine board."</p>
<p>"Alas!" Old Dashi sighed, and then remained silent, because the child's reply had made him understand everything. Although he was lying on the straw bed in the corner of the small house, he had not forgotten the ways of the world. He held little Nanluo's head in his arms, revealing a very loving expression.</p>
<p>He trembled slightly and said in a trembling voice, "My child, you are too poor! Too poor! How uncomfortable this makes you!"</p>
<p>Little Nanluo said softly: No, no, I am not poor, I am actually very rich. In fact, he secretly thought that he had the talent for painting, and his wealth far exceeded that of an emperor. At that moment, he walked to the door and stood in the quiet night, looking at the countless stars in the sky and the white poplars trembling in the wind.</p>
<p>All the rooms in the mill were brightly lit, and the sound of flutes was often blown over from the wind. Tears dripped from little Nanluo's face, but after a while, he put on a smiling face and said to himself, "Just wait for the future!" He lingered at the door for a long time, until the night was deep and everything was quiet, before returning to the house with Bradley and lying down to sleep together.</p>
<p>Little Nanluo had a secret that only Bradley knew. Next to the small house, there was another suite, which only he entered on weekdays. This was a very secluded place, but there was plenty of natural light shining in from the north. This was his studio. He used a rough piece of wood as a drawing board, and spread a large white sheet of paper for painting. All the impressions he had in his mind were drawn on it one by one.</p>
<p>No one had ever taught him about painting methods, and he didn't have any money to buy paints. Sometimes he couldn't even eat bread, so his paintings were never colored, but only black and white. He drew a very large portrait in lead powder; an old man sitting on a fallen tree, because he had seen the old woodcutter Laigel always sitting there at dusk.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement, Amateur Weekly Supplement News, The Preparation Process of the Sales Department of the Chinese Women's Production Cooperative, Ms. Fang Fan.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the writer saw the news in the newspaper that the Chinese Women's Production Cooperative was about to open, so she drove to visit Ms. Hu Ying, the manager of the cooperative, to inquire about the situation. She was told everything in detail. It is expected that this news will attract the attention of the community, so I discussed it with Ms. Hu and obtained her consent to publish her remarks as follows:</p>
<p>"Ms. Hu, you must be very busy now, right?"</p>
<p>"There is no particularly important work now. Please give me your instructions if you have anything to say."</p>
<p>"Your cooperative has been established for several years now, right? I really admire the efforts of you ladies for the society!"</p>
<p>"Don't dare! Don't dare! This is our due obligation, but we are not very good at running things, and we hope that people from all walks of life will give us more guidance. As for the past history of our cooperative, it is like this: because there are often many unemployed women who come to the Chinese Women's Temperance Association to ask for relief, Ms. Liu Wang Liming, the director of the association, feels the deepening of the current social depression. If there is no more practical way, there is no way to provide relief. So, in the spring of last year, she initiated the organization of the Chinese Women's Production Cooperative, leading them to use their own abilities to help themselves. In the past year, the results have been pretty good. Now we feel that this organization should be expanded and popularized, so we passed it through the board of directors and appointed several comrades to prepare for it in a hurry."</p>
<p>"Then what are the purposes and business nature and scope of your cooperative?"</p>
<p>"We feel that the crux of gender inequality mainly lies in the weak economic capacity of women. Many female compatriots are not necessarily incompetent, but because they have very few outlets in any aspect. At the same time, the products they produce cannot be sold far and wide for various reasons, just like the market of capitalist monopoly colonies. All markets are monopolized by men, so women have to bury their inherent abilities and become profit-sharers or victims of men. Now, the purpose of our cooperative, in addition to the calligraphy and painting department to promote women's culture and art, is to help the general laboring female compatriots sell their products, so that they can be sold well in the market and no longer be exploited by the middle class, so as to improve women's production and promote their economic independence. As for the business scope, it is temporarily divided into three departments.</p>
<p>The calligraphy and painting department only sells the products of Chinese female painters and female writers. However, the scope of books is wider, because many books on women and family issues should also be collected to meet the needs of readers.</p>
<p>The food department has an inseparable relationship between diet and hygiene, and the preparation of food is also a skill of women, so it is listed as a department.</p>
<p>Crafts have always been very historical in China. Since the eastward spread of European styles, people have valued machine-made products and inevitably ignored handicrafts. But science is indeed omnipotent, and manual labor also has its inherent advantages, so our cooperative also regards it as a basic part. For the time being, it is limited to the above three departments, but it can be expanded at any time. As long as it is a product of women, it can be sold by our cooperative, but this is purely a cooperative nature, and only a very small part of the proceeds from the sale is taken as a handling fee for our cooperative." Ms. Hu Ying, Manager and Director of Calligraphy and Painting Department of the Cooperative.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me about the preparation process and future policy of your cooperative?"</p>
<p>"Yes, since the board of directors resolved to add a sales department, it immediately approved a new Western-style store at No. 205 Yuanmingyuan Road, which is currently being renovated, and appointed the responsible personnel to start carrying out everything. Because we are divided into three departments here, each department must have a director to plan everything. Now that we are just starting out, things are still simple, so the position of director of the calligraphy and painting department is temporarily held by me. For all products of the department, the "painting" industry has already obtained the consent of several ladies from the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association, Feng Wenfeng, Chen Xiaocui, Yang Xuejiu, Li Qiujun, Wu Qingxia, Yu Jingzhi, Gu Qingyao, Zhou Lianxia, Xu Lengcui, and Jin Qiusheng, who have agreed to supply their best works to our cooperative: "Books" have also been discussed with major bookstores such as Women's Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, Zhonghua Bookstore, Commercial Press, and Life Bookstore to supply works by famous female writers such as Bing Xin, Ding Ling, Lu Yin, Xie Bingying, Yu Qingtang, and Shen Ziju to our cooperative. Ms. Liu Wang Liming, the founder of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>And works on women and family issues will be supplied to our cooperative, and Ms. Liu Wang Liming's own literary creation "The Waves of Life" will also be published; the meticulous constructions of the above ladies have long been popular at home and abroad, and there is no need for me to introduce them. The director of the crafts department is Ms. Zhang Xuehai. The items in this department include embroidery, manufacturing, and other handmade products. In addition to the Women's Home Affairs Advanced Vocational School and the Women and Children Education Institute taking charge of a part, the rest have been contacted in various aspects such as Beiping Shaoxing. The director of the food department is Ms. Wu Shuqing. The focus of the products in this department is on Chinese and Western refreshments, which are completely the results of the Home Affairs School. There are also several other staff members who assist together. However, we all take serving the society as our duty, so there is no salary. Unless the cooperative has a surplus, after deducting expenses and running charitable undertakings, everyone can share it equally. However, we still need to hire a female staff member who can speak fluent English and has some knowledge of bookkeeping. If there is such a talent and is interested in serving the society, they can describe their strengths in detail and write a letter to me—No. 14 Yuanchangli, Hualong Road—to contact me. As for the future policy, there is really nothing I can tell you, but at present, our women are always more or less under double or even triple oppression, which is undeniable. All undertakings related to women are still in the budding stage. There are certainly many supporters, but there will definitely be no shortage of people who intend to destroy them. I sincerely hope that everyone can work together to promote it slowly from Shanghai to the whole country. We know that in the current era of economic panic, it is not easy to run any undertaking well, but if you cannot fight against the bad environment and overcome all difficulties, then you will have no way out."</p>
<p>"Ms. Hu, you have extensive contacts, and you are certainly competent for the position of manager. Would you be willing to announce some of your resume and private life?"</p>
<p>"I am really ashamed to have been entrusted with this important task this time. Although the Chinese and Western directors of the Women's Temperance Association decided to appoint me, I always feel that I have spent too long in school life, and I am really still a student rather than a businessman. Although I have served in the political world for more than a year since leaving Peking University, and then ran around in the education and business circles for seven or eight years, according to my past experience, if I make a self-criticism, I am afraid I will not be able to be competent. Fortunately, I have the encouragement and support of friends from all walks of life, and the help of so many comrades. Just taking the competence and competence of the two ladies Zhang and Wu here is enough to be my good helpers, so I will reluctantly do my best, otherwise it may be inevitable to exceed the limit. As for my private life, it is really too simple. Except for reading a little Japanese at the Liangcai Supplementary School every night, there is nothing I can report. And the Women's Monthly Magazine has sent someone to interview me the day before yesterday, so to avoid repetition, I won't say more. Speaking of extensive contacts, I really dare not say that. It has only been ten years since I stepped into society. The people I know in the military, police, political, business, and academic circles are only a few thousand people. As for those who are relatively high-status in society, there are only a few hundred people. How can that be enough to be called contacts?"</p>
<p>"I heard that Ms. Hu is also a member of the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association founded by Ms. Tang Guanyu. When your cooperative opens in the future, there will probably be a lot of your works, right?"</p>
<p>"It's very embarrassing. Although there is one work with the inscription Hu Xin, it is my humble work, but I have never had time to practice. It is just a kind of pastime in my spare time. I remember that three years ago, I was commissioned by Mr. Xie Wuliang, Chen Liting, Xu Beihong, Zhang Shizhao and other gentlemen to set a remuneration example for me, but I am afraid that there are still less than a hundred large and small calligraphy pieces that I have responded to from all walks of life. I am really unfamiliar. I hope that all major experts will give me more advice in the future."</p>
<p>Current Affairs Research, The Discordant Anglo-French Relationship, Zhao Qi.</p>
<p>Both Britain and France are major supporters of the League of Nations. Diplomats in London and Paris have always used Geneva to their advantage. In this respect, it can be said that they have no conflict. But the main goal of British diplomacy after the war was to strive to maintain the balance of power in Europe, in order to preserve the British Empire's inherent position in Europe, and to maintain its rights in African and Asian colonies; while France's diplomatic vision was focused on the other side of the Rhine River, focused on Berlin; therefore, although the diplomatic policies of Britain and France were both based on the League of Nations, their respective goals were fundamentally different, which made it difficult for London and Paris to combine their wills fundamentally.</p>
<p>Recently, because Mussolini's expedition to Africa attempted to monopolize Abyssinia, the British felt that their African colonies were threatened, and the original power on the Mediterranean Sea was shaken. Therefore, when the news of the Italian-Ethiopian war broke out, Britain immediately shouted loudly in Geneva, implementing sanctions against Italy. Since France is also a supporter of the League of Nations, it is certainly inconvenient to openly leave Geneva and clearly support Italy's aggression; but in order to defend Germany, France and Italy had signed the Rome Agreement. In the hearts of Parisian diplomats, they naturally did not want to abandon their new friend, and follow the British to deal with Italy; therefore, in contradiction, France adopted a conciliatory and all-encompassing attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian issue. On the one hand, it continued to negotiate with Britain in Geneva, superficially respecting the League of Nations Covenant, and on the other hand, it secretly courted Rome, expressing its unwillingness to actively implement sanctions. As a result, British imperialism was certainly greatly unhappy, but other than being unhappy, there was no active way to deal with it for a while; and because there were no other good friends, they had to pretend to smile and continue to talk with Paris, dreaming that the Anglo-French relationship could be reconciled under a united front against Italy.</p>
<p>At the same time, just when the British-Italian conflict was acute and Britain and France could not agree, like a bolt from the blue, on the 7th of last month, Hitler suddenly declared the abolition of the Treaty of Locarno, marched into the Rhineland, and put forward six points of opinions as the basis for international peace negotiations. His excuse was that France's signing of a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union had violated the spirit of the Treaty of Locarno, so this treaty did not need to be observed, and the German army's entry into the Rhineland was justified. This was simply a blatant act of aggression and challenge to France. Therefore, France's response to Hitler's act of destroying the treaty, in addition to mobilizing troops and deploying them to the border, was to run to Geneva to shout about the crisis on the banks of the Rhine, and to demand that the signatory countries of the Treaty of Locarno and the League of Nations sanction Germany. But at this time, the Italian army invading Ethiopia had advanced to the Lake Tana region, and Britain was watching its rights on the Nile River with open eyes. The response to France's request was to pay more attention to the East African war, saying that European security could not be maintained until the East African problem was resolved. When the French peace plan was put forward, Berlin considered it to be "a towering skyscraper," Geneva considered it to be "a fanciful and ambitious plan that could not be implemented," and London's attitude was also very cold. On the 18th of this month, British Prime Minister Baldwin gave a speech in Hawasett, in addition to fiercely attacking Italy, he openly said that Hitler had "the greatest power to dispel the gloom in all of Europe." This situation was of course very displeasing to France. But in order to deal with Germany, and in order not to allow the British to openly support Hitler's treaty-breaking behavior, it still had to continue negotiations with London, requesting British military assistance. Although the British, French and even Belgian diplomats and staff have not discussed an effective solution for the continuous negotiations on the Rhineland issue, diplomatic negotiations still have to be carried out, because although they have their own agendas, although they cannot come together in the current situation, they are not willing to break up right away.</p>
<p>Because of the discordant Anglo-French relationship, Mussolini and Hitler, these two ambitious people, can of course run more boldly on their dangerous paths. In fact, because France is easing the sanction atmosphere in Geneva, the Italian army invading Ethiopia not only does not stop attacking, but also uses poison gas unscrupulously to poison unarmed Ethiopian people. Now the Italian army has occupied Taixi and is approaching the Ethiopian capital. The British rights on the Nile River have felt a more realistic threat, and the British-Italian conflict has developed into a more direct situation, but this, in addition to making the nerves of the British Empire tense, Paris is still maintaining its leisurely attitude towards this situation. On the other hand, after Hitler created the fact that the German army entered the Rhineland, he worked hard to build defense projects there, and expressed his intention to recover the lost colonies; at the same time, he also put forward many new suggestions and new problems in order to win over London's desires and attempt to shift Western Europe's attention to Eastern Europe. This kind of performance will certainly not shift Britain's gaze from the Nile River, but it is an intolerable attack for Paris. Therefore, under the British toleration of Hitler's treaty-breaking behavior, France has even recently expressed its intention to act freely and independently. At present, Geneva is paying close attention to the Nile and Rhine issues, but this attention comes from London and Paris. Therefore, there are two voices of sanctions in Geneva at present: one is to intensify sanctions against Italy as soon as possible, and the other is to implement sanctions against Germany. It goes without saying that the former is advocated by Britain, but France is easing the situation from it; conversely, the latter is advocated by France, but Britain is advising Parisian politicians not to "act emotionally."</p>
<p>According to a report on the 21st of this month, as a result of the Eden-Pengu talks, Britain and France have made concessions to each other and reached a compromise. In this compromise, what Eden got was: "France must not act emotionally and withdraw from the League of Nations in a fit of anger, because although the League of Nations has no power to solve the Rhineland issue, if France breaks away from the League of Nations, the Nile issue will become more difficult. France must not cancel the current sanctions against Italy, and must continue to abide by the League of Nations Covenant. Regarding the Rhineland issue, Britain should negotiate with Germany, so that the peace plans proposed by Germany and France can be considered at the same time; but for national affairs, time must be given so that Britain can proceed calmly. "As for what Pengu got was: "Although the current sanctions against Italy can be maintained, they do not need to be intensified. Britain must treat the Rhineland incident and the Italian-Ethiopian dispute equally, and must not be biased, so as to avoid increasing Germany's arrogance, resulting in another act of destroying the treaty, and Italy will not be quickly disappointed, so that the country has prepared to rejoin the European collective security organization. Regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, the British and French governments must cooperate sincerely to find a peaceful solution. "Such a so-called compromise, although on the surface shows the mutual concern between Britain and France, the so-called "friendly spirit," but in reality, France did not abandon Italy and actively help Britain; similarly, Britain did not abandon its attitude of tolerating Hitler and stood on the side of France and resolutely implemented the obligations of international treaties. In fact, on the first day after this so-called compromise was reached, the opinions of the British and French representatives at the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations were also significantly inconsistent, which exposed the "crack" in the structure of the League of Nations. According to Eden's speech, Italy violated the League of Nations Covenant and should be dealt with in a consistent manner; but Pengu said that to deal with the threats in Europe, Italy must cooperate fully. - This expression has fully explained that the so-called Anglo-French compromise is only to a certain extent, and it is superficial; the spirit of London and Paris has not yet reached a consensus.</p>
<p>However, under such a discordant Anglo-French relationship, first, Germany and Italy will inevitably become bolder and move towards a dangerous path, thus causing the conflict between Britain and Italy and between France and Germany to become more acute. Now, the Italian army has occupied the Guberra area bordering British and Egyptian Sudan, facing the British army and air force stationed there from afar, so the armed conflict between Britain and Italy is on the verge of breaking out. As for the relationship between Germany and France, although there is not necessarily a very possible outbreak of war, under the British tolerance and encouragement, Hitler's constant adventurous actions may ignite the European fire line at any time. Secondly, due to the inability of Britain and France to agree, the League of Nations will become a useless organization that cannot solve problems, and the situation in Europe and even the world will become more chaotic.</p>
<p>At the same time, following Germany's announcement of the abolition of the Treaty of Locarno, there is also Hungary's rearmament and expansion, and Turkey's restoration of military equipment in the straits. These are all sufficient to make the European situation more tense and chaotic.</p>

<p>(Washington) The House Naval Committee submitted a report today requesting the passage of an appropriation of $175,000,000 for auxiliary vessels. The report also stated that the Pacific coast extends for more than 2,000 miles, and there are very few shipyards for repairing warships. If a war breaks out with a major power in the Pacific, the defense of the West Coast will be seriously affected. Therefore, it is necessary to take remedial measures as soon as possible.

<p>(Rome) The Pontine Marshes, originally a swamp, have been transformed into a plain after recent construction and filling. The government plans to build a new city on the site, named the City of Aprilia. The groundbreaking ceremony was held recently. Villagers from nearby areas arrived in droves, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Prime Minister Mussolini personally attended and presided over the ceremony, giving a speech saying, "It has been 160 days since the League of Nations imposed economic sanctions on Italy. During this long period, the chaos and poverty of the world have increased, but our country's indomitable will and calm response have been clearly demonstrated. After the City of Aprilia's groundbreaking today, it will be officially completed on October 29, 1937. In addition, we plan to build the City of Pomezia, which will be completed on October 29, 1939. By then, our work will be completed, and another new victory will be added to the glorious history of Italy." After the Prime Minister finished his speech, he personally held a hoe, drawing a line on the ground as the boundary of the new city, and then left in a car amidst the cheers of the villagers.

<p>(London) The Confederation of League of Nations Unions has recently resolved to demand that the government step up sanctions against Italy and close the Suez Canal so that peace in East Africa can be quickly restored. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Confederation of League of Nations Unions met in Edinburgh last night. Lord Lytton (former Chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Inquiry Commission) delivered a speech, stating, "The international situation has reached a desperate point and should be dealt with by burning one's boats in order to achieve success. Italy has expressed its determination to complete the invasion of Abyssinia, and the sanctions decided by the League of Nations have not been able to stop it. Therefore, the only way to stop the East African war is to close the Suez Canal to cut off Italy's communication with East Africa. Foreign Secretary Eden will submit a proposal for closure when the League of Nations Council meets next month on the 11th, and he has stated that if the Council decides to proceed, Britain will comply." (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures recently declared that the Confederation of League of Nations Unions is now actively promoting the League of Nations, and Lord Lytton's speech in Edinburgh last night can be seen as a 'desperate plea' from the sanction advocates to the Cabinet, and the impact may even lead to the dissolution of the Cabinet. Well-informed sources believe that Foreign Secretary Eden may agree to the proposal for stepped-up sanctions, but Prime Minister Baldwin opposed it. The Confederation of League of Nations Unions held a plebiscite last spring to gauge public support for the League of Nations' principles. The results showed that out of 12 million votes, 9,627,606 voted in favor of unconditional economic sanctions, and 6,506,777 voted in favor of taking military sanctions (if necessary) to stop acts of aggression. It can be seen from this that the Confederation has the support of national public opinion. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station has been preparing for the establishment of a Sino-Philippine wireless telephone service for a long time.

In the future, communication will start between Shanghai and Manila first. However, although there are many agreements between our country and international radio telephones, the high rates make business unsuccessful.
