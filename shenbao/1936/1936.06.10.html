<p>英國駐華經濟使節李滋羅斯自去秋來華考察經濟政治迄今已半年有餘最近羅斯自華北考察走私問題回來後又於上月三十一日離滬赴日這幾天正與日本外交財政當局會晤交換對華問題的意見據羅斯在船上對同盟社記者所言彼此决訪問日本之目的係因去年來華之前曾與日本當局作種種之懇談尚有未得到諒解之處所以此决擬再商議彼將由第三者之立塲調整日本與中國及日本與英國問之利害關於中國之經濟的財政的再建如得日本的協力彼認爲當可做到羅斯並言此决赴日携有若千試案觀此談話可知羅斯此行之於中國是有如何重大的關係了</p>
<p>羅斯本是英國政府的財政顧問對於經濟問題的處理向負時譽他非但有豐富的經騐而且還有機警的手叚去秋之奉派來華就負有挽救因日本大陸政策的挺進而受嚴重打擊之英國遠東利益的重大任務當他初來遠東時就先訪問日本當局想與日本商妥平分對華利益的辦法可是却給日本拒絕了後來在華考察經濟頗有相當的建樹最近則因華北走私形勢的嚴重給與英國在華的利益以極大的打擊於是就又奉英政府之命而往日本想「由第三者的立塲調整日本與中國及日本興英國間之利害」了</p>
<p>羅斯這决訪日能够不蹈上决覆轍而獲得相當的成功嗎這問題的答案是要看日本的態度如何而决定的就表面上說日本對於羅期這决赴日的態度已比前决要好得多當前决羅斯赴日時日本當局是極不表示歡迎的而這决呢空氣已經緩和得多了甚至陸軍當局也予以同情的歡迎這原因是由於「羅斯留華半載精密研究中國經濟事情之結果已變更從來意見認識如無日本恊力中國經濟及其他一切問題均難望得圓滿解决於是覺悟中國與日本提携始得實現英國在中國所希望之事態」（見同盟社東京五日電）但在事際上英日會談的前途並不能如此樂觀第一本月五日日政府舉行之外海陸三相會議已决定如下的對付態度「日本與中國有特殊關係尤其在華北因要考慮中日「滿」三國關係及爲東亞安全之日本立塲不能如英國僅由經濟立塲處理華北走私問題及其他一切問題故對羅斯之行不能與之商議具體事項」第二日本現正厲行大陸政策而且已有很大的成就此時决不願將口角邊的肥肉讓與英國分嘗一嚮這觀於日本駐南京總領事須磨之談話就可瞭然須磨於日前回國時在神戶對日本記者說：「中國對日祇有互相維繫與作戰二條路日本不能有所退讓如退讓一步郎不啻總退却日本必須懷抱不可變更之自信邁步前進」第三當去年羅斯赴日時英國遠東屬地正極力排斥日貨引起日本極大的反戚而這决羅斯赴日時澳洲又宣布提高日貨入口關稅以致二國關係頗爲惡化從上面三點觀察這决英日會談的前途如何已可想而知</p>
<p>不管英日會談的前途如何其結果總是於中國的利益有妨害的因爲帝國主義者對於弱小民族總難得有眞心的同情與帮助的在人家恊以謀我的時候我們是應該怎樣起來籌謀對付之法啊</p>

<p>（東京）英政府經濟顧問李滋羅斯爵士及英國駐日大使克萊武爵士今日與日外相有田及外務决官掘內會談兩小時、羅斯極言中英日三國應以經濟利益爲基礎、彼此合作、有田則極言中日關係之政治重要性、涉及日本國家之生存、羅斯繼言中國經濟復興、可大益於各國、並希望列强輔助中國建造鐵路、有田答稱、關於中國建造鐵路事、現需鄭重考慮、因以經濟助力給予中國、與中國政治安全有密切關係也、聞有田對於羅斯所述中國銀行制度改革之意見、表示贊同、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）李滋羅斯於九日午後三時、與駐日英大使克萊武同至外相官邸訪有田外相、堀內决官亦參加、談論達二小時、至午後五時吿畢、茲將其問答錄於左、</p>
<p>一般問題</p>
<p>（有田）考察中國情形吿竣、在歸國以前特訪日本與我朝野人士會談、余認爲在增進日英間之諒解上、最合時宜之事也、</p>
<p>（羅斯）關於余之使命、頗受日本朝野人士之各種誤會、實爲遺憾、余在華活動非僅爲英國謀利益、蓋以中國恢復經濟、一般民衆之購買力卽有增加、英日美及共他與中國有關係之各國、亦必獲得經濟上之利益、</p>
<p>改革幣制</p>
<p>（羅斯）白銀國有之中國幣制改革、自去年十一月實施以來、漸决順暢、得以發展、余認爲縱令無外國之援助、亦能以其自力維持該項制度、</p>
<p>（有田）直至今日之情勢、或能作上項樂觀的觀察、亦未可知、但將來究竟能吾維持現有制度、當屬疑問、</p>
<p>經濟援助</p>
<p>（有田）對華經濟援助、因與中國政情之安定有密接關係、非愼重考慮不可、以外國資本而經營中國鐵道、究竟是吾具有任何程度之經濟確實性、倘不加以具體檢討、當不能斷定、</p>
<p>（羅斯）對於中央銀行問題尊見如何、願承敎言、</p>
<p>（有田）該項趣旨余亦同感、但對華經濟援助在國內與國際尤其對於日本政治上之安定、當有作爲前提之必要、</p>
<p>走私問題</p>
<p>（有田）中國國內事情之走私事件、余覺其中必有所以發生之原因在、余聞中國並不僅華北爲然、卽華南方面亦行使多量走私、英國政府對此作何想像、</p>
<p>（羅斯）此係廣東情形、但廣東海關之某種進口稅率實與南京政府問訂有確切之規定云、（九日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（東京）有田外相於九日午前九時半至官邸訪廣田首相、作重要商議後、卽列席閣議、當日所商者、因本日午後的定與李滋羅斯氏會談關於中日英等項關係、相當具有重大性、故預先聽取廣田首相之意見、以作應付羅斯之談話準備、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）馬塲藏相訂於十日午後四時、在藏相官邸與英國遣華經濟使節李滋羅斯氏會見、聽取該氏之對華見解、以及對東亞經濟界與政局之意見、藏相亦須說明其所見、彼此當有重要之懇談、（九日同盟電）</p>
<h3 id="c18">對華經濟援助　磯谷說明立塲 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>謂日與英國環境不同　不能不考慮政治影響</p>
<p>（東京）李滋羅斯於八日下午四時半、在英國大使官邸會見磯谷軍務局長亘一時半之久、至六時始畢、羅先對磯谷謂、余在華九月、對於中國政治經濟的實狀、已得相當認識、中國財政不無缺陷、吾人對於中國實行財政的援助、於中國本身及遠東和平實有益處、余返本國報吿日本關於對華援助之態度、請閣下盡量說明日本允其軍部之對此意見、磯谷軍務局長答曰、余以個人資格說明意見、則日本衷心希望援助中國、使其經濟更生、其熱心之程度不亞於英國、然中國國內事情極爲複雜、且中日兩國在地理上有密接關係、故雖爲財政的援助、然其結果、立卽發生政治的因果關係、因此日本要考慮無政治的影饗之財政援助、實不可能也、日本與英國異其環境、不能採取單以經濟的行動爲目的之國策、希英當局諒察此點、而認織日本立塲、然後與日本外交與財政當局交換意見、則必能認識彼此立塲不同之處、羅斯在此會見似已諒解日本對華立塲、定於今明日中會見外務省或財政當局、交涉對華援助及調整華北走私問題、（八日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）李滋羅斯日來與磯谷軍務局長及財界巨頭等人會見、日本政府所得之印象、認爲李氏尙未完全正當認識、故彼此在認識上尙不無相當之隔閡、李氏以爲對華行使財政援助、倘使財界安定、則非獨英國有利、日本亦受其益、蓋將中國問題僅由經濟上之見地而處理之、以爲卽足以濟事、但日本政府則由東亞之中日特殊關係上觀察、認爲中國依賴歐美、此項主義當有淸算之必要、茲聞其觀察情形如左、</p>
<p>倘中國向英國成立借欵因而改革幣制、與夫其他方法英國將中國銀行與關稅等等均歸其掌握、則一切政策皆可從此而出、中國依賴歐美、於是與日本在政治上不可分離之關係將有沒却之虞、假令英國援助中國財政、縱然提議共同借欵、倘中國在政治上未曾表示願與日本提携之熱誠、則日本斷不能應允、日本政府之觀點認爲英國對華、以日英共同借欵及粵漢鐵路爲基本而擴充鐵道網、以圖商業之進展、藉以維持旣得之權益、同時抱有擴大之希望、拭目以待其機會之到來、但中國對於束亞現狀旣未覺悟、則共同援助財政結局、徒使英國在經濟上獲利、而日本僅作守門犬之動務、在情勢上不無此種憂慮也、</p>
<p>日本政府上項之見解、至爲牢固、　對華共同援助財政案、當以政治上之考慮爲先决問題、在英國本身言之、不過具有第二項之利害關係而已、對華則欲求得日英之恊調、而對於日澳·日埃·通商交涉及其他本國殖民地屬領等處之經濟問題、毫未表示與日本謀協調之事實、可見對於日本在東亞之地位、英國方面尙屬認識不足、故日本政府在今後一切機會、當决定其根本態度如左、</p>
<p>日本對華利害與英國大不相同、須知乃日本之死活問題、　日本在東亞之特殊地位未經充分認識、而侈談恊調、須知結局當終於不可能、</p>
<p>上項主張至爲竭力將李滋羅斯氏之對日認識、再行加以糾正、希望在此新認識之下、樹立英國對華政策、日方意見似已趨於一致矣、（九日同盟社電）</p>

<p>羅斯謂中國經濟安定　於英日兩國均有利益</p>
<p>（東京）日本經濟聯盟八日午后六時舉行李滋羅斯之歡迎晚餐會、關於中國之幣制改革·英國之對華借欵·中國經濟恢復等各問題自由討論後、開始盛大之晚餐、席上串因萬藏氏演說云、「吾等日本人與中國之經濟的反映及政治的安定、雖感有利害關係、然日英兩國間於其對華政策、自有不相同之點、依吾人所見、英國之利害關係、在於中國經濟商業財政之上、反之、日本之利害關係、在於中國之整頓之上、此乃日本之福祉及國民的存在所不可缺者、日英兩國政策之不同、卽由此而分、然在中國根本的爲利益者、對於日英兩國亦爲利益、此事至明、故欲恢復中國之經濟、甚望日英兩國之恊力、」</p>

<p>次李滋羅斯起而答覆云、「余之任務、時謀中國之經濟的安定以外、別無使命、余意此舉於日本亦有利益、將來中國安定之時、卽可了解余之任務將來爲發展中國之故、余希望與日本協力進行、」（九日同盟電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）澳洲聯邦司法部長孟雪斯、頃於本日在帝國協會發表演說、略謂、「澳洲聯邦對於太平洋沿岸各國、均當維持最友善的關係、其所推行之關係政策、雖足使日本出口貨失去市塲、而爲英國商品推廣銷路、但澳洲政府之以優惠待遇給予英國、非卽對於日本表示敵意、此日本所當了解者也」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>九江農村生活（下）　姜愛羣</p>
<p>農民的副業</p>
<p>農民的副業要，女子方面除少數到街上久興紗廠和中華火柴公司等處做工以外，大都是坐在家裏，做着賢妻良母。勤儉的農家都以糊火柴盒為唯一副業，每糊火柴匣一千個，祇得工銀四百文，常常忙煞了一家老幼，還要賠貼糊帶漿紛和取送火柴匣的挑力才能獲得，這好像是火柴廠太刻薄了罷，其實這些本國火柴廠正受了外國火柴業的傾軋，還在風雨飄搖中掙扎求生存，所以無寧說，這是帝國主義者侵蝕勢力深入農村之一佐證。男子方面單靠田地是不夠的，看前節農民耕種田地的貧乏，可以想像，反之，他們大宗的收入，是靠盧山的挑擔和抬轎得來，如果說挑擔和抬轎是正業，也不無相當理由的。挑擔的工價，（自九江街到牯嶺共長四十三里）每百斤三吊錢，貴重物品須加意保護者，可增到一吊或二吊錢。抬轎的農民，九江和黃梅各佔半數，抬轎的工價，（自盧山腳的蓮花洞到牯嶺山路十八里）每頂法幣四元，四人共抬各得一元，因為轎子是中國旅行社的，每人須得納租二角，他們常常抬外國人，所以能說幾個英語單字，如「大羅司」「也司」和「那莫溫」等等，兼做這兩種副業的，幾年前有四五千號，近年來祇有二三千號了，每年生意以五月到九月為最盛，每人每年生意好，可凈賺一百元，生意不好，也可凈賺五六十元，對於他們家用的幫助也很可觀了，但是當他們工作時，在毒烈的炎日下上山下山的奔波狀况，凡在盧山避暑者　當想像到怎么的辛苦和危險吓！上山的中途有一外叫做「好漢坡」的，山勢陡削，不易攀登，俗傳過得此坡方為好漢，如果把這個美名，送給這些農民，眞才當得而無慚愧啊！此外砍柴出售也是重要副業，因為篇幅係不多說了。</p>
<p>農民的徵工服役</p>
<p>近年來農民除遭遇水旱兩災嚴重損失外，最感覺苦痛的，要算政府的徵工服役了，三年以來每保民衆服役情形有如下述：二十三年一月築九星路（九江到星子）徵一百餘工，二十四年六月補徵三十餘工，二十三年三月築飛機場徵三百餘工，同年十月築九瑞路（九江到瑞昌）徵四百餘工，二十四年三月因補修又徵百餘工，二十四年十月築濂溪路徵二百餘工（有些加上開河塡河工程做到一千餘工）二十五年一月築九湖路（九江到湖口）徵六百餘工，以及其他修築橋梁搬運木材零工徵百餘工，總計起來，不下二千餘工（平均每家為二十個工）有些農家是倩人應徵的，必得負擔一筆很重的雇工工資，沒有能力倩人應徵的，祇得家主親自出馬了，往往一家老幼靠他來挑擔維持生活的，這時不得不拋下自己一家的衣食問題前去服役，而且因為服役地點的遙遠，總得十天八天才回，那就不特不能掙錢回來維持全家生活，反而要向高利貨者哀求乞憐，通過重利盤剝之門，借些錢來買米買鹽，帶到服役地點應用。最近傳說修築九星九湖九瑞三路，省方津貼民工費十萬元，但到了地方政府以後，不是說作了測量辦公之用，便是說留作橋梁水管之需，種種藉詞，搪塞農民，農民犧牲自己工作，賠了柴米應徵，已經損失很大，豈連測量費及橋梁水管費，還要農民負擔嗎？總之江西的人民慘遭共匪多年蹂躪，如以前年大旱為災，農作物差不多顆粒無收，民間已十室十空，亟須休養生息·這一點政府不能不特別注意的。（完）</p>

<p>浙江省蠶絲統制委員會主席委員會義甫氏、赴浙各產繭區域視察、業己完竣、新聲社記者昨特往訪曾氏、蒙吿浙省今年產繭經過詳情、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>春繭豐收</p>
<p>今年新繭登塲後、曾赴浙江各產繭區域視察、而各處改良種之發育經過、及產繭數量、均甚良好、浙江所發之改良種子、約一百二十萬張、平均採繭在三十斤以上、所以浙江全省今年春繭產額、改良種總共約三十六萬担鮮繭、土種則約十八萬担鮮繭、至於嘉興吳興於濟臨安等處改良種繭質、多數均甚優良、繅折不到四百斤、武康崇德等處繭質較次、其原因由以與餘姚製土種子區域相距較近、其繅折約四百五十斤零、</p>
<p>統會收繭</p>
<p>蠶絲統制委員會為救濟農民起見、向中交二銀行借欵五百萬元、作為收買今春浙省餘繭之用、關於收繭事宜、歸二十五年春期收繭委員會辦理、果然今年春繭豐收、雖經絲廠商及餘繭商盡量吸收、但尚有餘額、總約十餘萬担鮮繭、均由統委會收買、收得之繭、歸繅絲委員會發給、統委會指導之浙絲廠新式絲車三千部繅絲、繅成之絲、由生絲推銷處銷售、大部份仍照去年辦法、歸上海出口商經售、一部份歸推銷處直接銷售與國外市塲、</p>
<p>平衡繭價</p>
<p>蠶繭統制委員會對今年絲廠商及餘繭商收買春繭、規定中心繭價、其扯價改良種為三十元、土種為二十一元、同時嚴禁抬價及抑價、嗣後據報、各收繭商人雖大多均依照此中心繭價收買、但有扯價稍低者、省政府為維護農民計、非常注意、對己收之繭、其扯價在中心繭價以下者、予以扣留四成、同時抽樣試騐、如果其繅折之大與收價之低、以比例計算、與規定中心繭價之五百五十斤相符者、因其與統委會所審理原則相同、當無問題、</p>
<p>製種自給</p>
<p>我國今年春繭改良種種子、江浙兩省約共發出四十萬張、係向國外訂購、是項種子所產之繭、繭質亦甚優良、今浙統制委員會自設之嘉興分塲製種塲、己積極進行、預料明年起、我國蠶種、可以自給、不致再向國外購買、預料明年春種、我國可產三百五十萬張、如以每張產繭三十斤計算、則江浙兩省可產繭一百餘萬担、况且土種尚不在內、現在農民對改良種之信仰甚著、所以預料明年起、土種逐漸减少云云、</p>
<p>扣繭放行</p>
<p>浙江省蠶絲統制委員會、奉省政府令、對絲廠商及餘繭商在浙境收買春繭者、其扯價在標準數以下者、（土種二十一元改良種三十元）予以扣留、上海絲廠棄公會曾電請放行、新聲社記者昨向滬絲廠商探悉、今浙蠶絲統制委員會、　己扣之繭業己如數放行、同時並抽樣試騐繅折、以便决定處催辦法、將來罰欵、决在各收繭商之保證金項下扣除云、</p>

<p>槪述</p>
<p>刺繡一業，為我中國美術工藝之一，在女子手工業中，頗占相當地位，溯其起源，遠在四千年前。唐虞時代之黼黻。即為刺繡業之濫觴。惟自唐虞以迄近代，皆僅限於皇室之禮服；及文武官員之公服，方可採用，故該業從無蓬勃發展之餘地也。</p>
<p>逮明季我國與海外通商以後，有葡萄牙人，購得中國繡片携歸本國，國王大為贊賞，從此我國刺繡在海外漸著聲譽，國人亦起而重視，該業始獲逐漸昂首之機會。有清以來，文化與美術，與日俱進，對於刺繡一項，提倡不遺餘力，除皇室貢品；以及莽袍披肩補褂等禮服外，即其他日常衣胥，亦都備置，營業因而鼎盛，每年消費恒值銀千餘萬兩，是為該業之黃金時代。</p>
<p>民國以還，服制變更，兼之歐西各國，機械進化，出品日新月異，服飾一項，咸以機製品代替，刺繡一業因之日趨衰落；漸入簫條之境。民十年後，該業乃另闢蹊徑，將繡品改為美術裝飾品，作為饋贈親友之禮物，斯時社會經濟，尚稱充裕，購買方强盛，營業頗堪維待，民二十年來，因國內各地頻年困於天災人禍，益以東北失陷；滬戰吿終，國內工商業，疲憊不堪，經濟恐慌，日益深刻，故營業遜色，大有一落千丈之勢，據業中人稱，該業年來營業額，比以前旺盛時，减少十之七八云，茲將該業槪况，分述於後：</p>
<p>繡品類別　刺繡為我國古代著名工藝，考其繡法，大別為二種：一以往複經緯之法，排列成之謂之直紋繡。一以五下結納之法，積疊成之，謂之短針繡，直紋繡者：出自蘇省崑屬唯亭鎮，以彩絲經緯編製血成，名為緙絲者是，惟現今市上已不多見矣。短針繡者，計分為廣繡蘇繡　種，蘇繡又名顧繡，因刺繡人物，創始於上海顧會海之妾，善針黹，刺繡人物神氣生動，字亦有法，繡品工緻，價值最昂，即所謂畫繡者是。惟顧氏已無傳其製者。今則湖南之湘繡，實出於廣繡蘇繡之上，蓋湘繡重寫眞，凡繡花鳥魚蟲，精神　現；栩栩如生，然用針太粗，可遠望而不可近視，且價貴而出品不多耳。</p>
<p>近年來，除上述數種外，復有溫繡賽繡；以及絲織錦繡之分，溫繡手工組劣，畫稿太拙，每致畫虎成犬，難與蘇繡湘繡抗衡，雖不識之士，亦目為顧繡，賽繡完全按畫稿，用膠質顏料噴畫，出品尚稱悅目，惜無生氣，且膠質易於脫落，殊不耐久也。</p>
<p>絲織錦繡，創自民國十年，浙杭都錦生君發明，彼對於機織物，研究有素，頗具心得，鑒於國內藝術工藝之落後，墨守陳法，毅然採取直紋繡之組織，加以改良，復運用新式機械，精密配製，計分彩素兩種，出品迅速，花色繁多，凡一切手工所不能繡者，均可織製，且色澤鮮艷得宜，神態逼眞，驟視之與生者無異，可謂刺繡業中別樹一幟也。</p>
<p>繡品用途　繡品之種類既如上述，考其用途，首推蘇繡為最廣，蓋其出品，針工精細，適宜裁製被面，桌衣，繡枕繡墊，以及其他－切錦繡之衣料等，物既華麗，又切實用，銷路頗廣，至其他繡件，槪為美術裝飾品，以名人書畫，風景人物為大宗，其次為幃屏，檯圍坐墊等，除湘繡與錦繡，各有共特殊優點，銷路暢達外，其餘均平平，較諸蘇繡，不無遜色矣。</p>
<p>繡品市價　刺繡既為藝術工藝之一，故共價格無定，殊非機製品所可比擬，蓋其繡工遲緩，出品不多，故往往高於機製者一倍至數倍，且刺繡除上述之理由外，還需視緞料之優劣，繡件之大小，圖案之繫複，以及針工之疏密為準，按該業鼎盛時，以定件論，高至千數百元，中至三五百元，少至百元左右不等，普通成品，怛在三數元至數百元之間，惟近年來，時易勢遷，營業慘落，市價步跌，較諸往昔，至少减去十之三四矣。至繡品躉批選辦，批價特廉，照共標價五折上下，即可成交，聞其利潤，尚甚豐厚，蓋其繡工低廉，（每件三四角至百數十元不等）成本較微，非業內人，不易明察也，聞民二十年，本埠錦華耀湘繡莊，承繡美總統胡佛照相一幀，約三英寸見方，素價國幣千元，尚稱低廉，後得該國芝加哥博覽會藝術獎狀，以示嘉許云。</p>
<p>絲織錦繡，以機械織製，出品迅速，產量繁多，並應市場需要，得隨時增减，出品價格，不論定貨或現貨，槪以尺寸之大小，結構之繁複，計訂定價，（惟定織者，酌加製版費），每幅自3×4英寸售價三角起，至39×80英寸售價八十元止，日後亦無增削，較諾刺繡，低賤倍餘，故營業頗稱發達，能與刺繡品並駕前驅，實非徼倖也，年來受經濟簫條影響，購買力薄弱，營業驟减，如遇躉批交易，按定價降至五折亦願脫售矣。（未完）</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨與走私，是站在不兩立的地位，有走私，卽無國貨，維護國貨，卽應撲滅走私。人生何事不可爲，何業不可就，何處不可以賺錢盈利，而必欲幹此走私生活者，非不知人間羞恥之徒；卽喪心病狂之輩。</p>
<p>撲滅走私，利用密報，固極有效。但最有效之辦法，莫如借重同業公會之力量，賦予以檢査舉發之全權。則各業戒嚴，互相監視，走私之風，或可歙跡。故自下最緊要之辦法，莫如嚴密同業公會之組織，使各業公會，各有眞實之力量，一致之態度，以與走私之輩相周旋。目下修改同業公會法令之呼聲，舉國已有一致之傾向，改革放任主義代以干涉主義，尤爲修改本法之要素，胡君西園提議組織工業會，與商會同爲工商業合法之集團，亦無非加强工業集團之力量，治本之策，允爲獨到之見。頗聞各團體正在推員研究，以便條陳中央政府，採擇施行。最近電機絲織業公會，綢緞業公會，人造絲業公會，聯合議决各廠人造絲包上，必須黏貼印花，吾則卽作私貨論，聞已一致贊同，各業公會苟都有此種統制之力量，則走私不足懼也。</p>

<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>近來一般經濟專家和政治要入，常常發表非常時期的財政讜論，金融的應急措施，財政的計劃處理，娓娓動聽，的確，國家已處在非常危急的環境！專家論非但動聽而已，實爲非常時期應有的計劃。我們試看　北的走私問題，已嚴重到萬分！報載：津海關統計，上年度該關及長城各口稅卡，共收稅欵達四千一百萬元，本年度因走私影響，减少的達二千萬元之鉅！出口稅雖增收數十萬元，遠不敷抵補云云，及某方指我津，秦，芝罘海關武裝砲艇在渤海灣緝私，指爲侵入公共領海，向我抗議……其無理要求，經濟侵略的惡勢；宰制我國整個財政的陰謀；走私嚴重的背景複雜；實已昭然若揭！</p>
<p>從非常時期，我又聯想到國貨救國，中國人用中國貨，這是天經天義的事情，某貨無論牠怎樣便宜！尤其是走私的東西！我們决不可理睬，决不可受誘！須知國家生存一天，纔用得到一天國貨，苟國破家亡，我們的衣　食·件·用·的需求，受敵人的統制，要想一心買國貨，要想一心救國，恐已噬臍無及了！所以我說非常時期的來臨，是國人一心一德加緊實行「國貨救國」的日子！我們不容一刻玩忽的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c184">參觀中華敎育用品廠記 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>前天早晨，天氣很熱，我們乘星期的機會，到昆明路去拜訪我們的老師—凌文之先生，順便去參觀他所服務的中華敎育用品廠。天雖然將要下雪，我們一些也不感到冷。</p>
<p>該廠各分三大工場：第一工場再出金工，木工，漆工，電鍍，裝配五部。道裏面大概都是製造科學儀器等用具，各學校採用的很多，都一致認爲滿意，從前各種儀器都靠舶來品，現在大致都國產品可代巷了。</p>
<p>第二工場是製造地球儀，人體模型，標本，顯微鏡玻片。凌先生說『這裏工人，不但是要用力，而且要有『天才』同時要有訓練才行，往往做一件標本，要幾個禮拜才可完畢，好樣是魚的解剖模型，第一步是細心地解剖開來，第二步是要明白魚的組織，淸楚地把牠說明，有許多缺少道種「天才」的人，是决做不成功的，一條魚並不貴，可是經過了解剖，就要買好許多錢了。』有許多製造人體模型的人，都用厚紙板糊成人的形狀，大的小的，男的女的，十分有趣。做這工作，也需要幾步手續，有的部份是用厚紙的，有的部份是用石膏的，裝配成了後，還要繪顏色，工作的人都非明瞭人的生理組織不可。我們又到顯微鏡玻璃片部，看見許多玻璃片，裏面有各種病菌的形狀，道些塊奇的用具，將要把「學」與「事實」打成一片，功用是十分大的。標本的製法，又可分四部，　浸製　乾製　骨骼　剝製。我們看了好一會，又到第三工塲去。</p>
<p>這工塲是只做月日星期時辰鐘，中國還是第一家製造，用了這鐘，祗須開動發條，自動地會報吿日期，和鐘點。例如我們參觀的日子，那鐘的左角就標着某月十某日星期五等字樣，用了這鐘，有許多便利。製造鐘有五個程序：第一部是打樣，樣子打好了，就有金工部依着樣子雙成金屬品，像齒輪，軸，針，等零件，第三都是製模部，把鐘的輪廓做好，於是一起送給裝置部裝置，待裝置畢了後，該廠還要在較騐部較騐過，使其準確。這樣這鐘便完成了。除了發條等中國絕對沒有出產的外，其餘大都採用國產品，使得金錢不會流到外國去。</p>
<p>最後，凌先生又招神我們到陳列室去，其中陳列各種產品，從幼稚園到大學，都很完備了。該廠東面，　一個動植物園，以培　該廠製造標本之用，最近將注意於童子軍用具，兒童玩具，經濟儀　三項，該廠全部出品，由中華書局發售，營業總額每年的五十多萬元。</p>
<p>末了。我們對於凌先生殷殷招待，盛激之至。這一次參觀，增我們不少智識，盛到異常滿意。</p>
<h3 id="c185">陸仲文葉良發明　旋轉式三用電燈泡 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>這當然是一件可喜的事悄，民國二十五年的序幕展開而後，我們接連的聽到有人發明東西，誰說中國人沒有發明力，而今可大家不相信了。最近我們知道距離上海不遠的南匯地方，有兩位靑年陸仲文和葉良發明一種旋轉式的三用電燈泡，這當然是提倡國貨聲中的一好個消息呢！</p>
<p>電燈泡，近年以來，國人設廠自造。所謂國貨電燈泡者也是不少。然而出品方面，大都粗劣，不能和舶來品競爭。所以結果呢，直到現在電燈泡事業，還是被外國廠家把市塲獨佔了去。現在陸葉兩君，發明了旋轉三用電燈泡，我們深望其能够把外國燈泡打倒，使其滅跡於中國市塲。</p>
<p>據說這種旋轉式三用燈泡，分甲乙兩種。甲種有三根光度不同的鎢絲，製造在一個燈泡裏面，譬如五十支，二十五支，五支，如果你需耍什麽光綫時，祗須把燈頭上面的外圈略爲旋轉，就可變動。而且一種光度燃亮時，其他兩種鎢絲，完全不關的，所以沒有事情時用小光，辦公時用中光，宴會用大光，一個燈泡三種變化，隨你變換是非凡便利的。</p>
<p>乙種是在一個燈泡裏面，裝着三根同一光度的鎢絲，這樣你的燈泡經過若干時燃燒斷掉一根之後，可以用其餘的兩根。也祇須旋轉一下直要等到三根鎢絲完全燒斷後，才成廢物。</p>
<p>所以事實上，甲乙兩種燈泡，雖是一個燈泡，都有三個燈泡用塲，而且這種三用燈泡，費電旣省，用法亦易，永無爆裂或碰的危險。燈頭部份，能够自動明熄，祇須把燈泡略爲旋動，就可發光或熄滅。不必另外用開關。外表鍍克羅咪更是非常美觀。所以將來一經出貨。不拘商店，學校，公私機關，都很適用的。</p>
<p>陸仲文和葉良，都是本市民立中學的畢業生，離校後曾供職於電器公司，所以對於電器方面，素有心得。這决經過了一年多研究，才發明這種旋轉式三用電泡。現在實業部方面，已表示嘉獎，並特准專利五年。陸葉二君，亦正在積極籌備，廣事招股之中，想設廠之期，爲時不遠了。</p>
<p>這個燈泡廠的開辦，資本方面，據說至少要二萬元，現有祇招到半數，一待資本足額，就要開工製造。倘然股欵而能招到十萬元或八萬元，那麽可大規模的製造了。他們的廠名已定「中央三用式燈泡廠」，廠址擬擇小沙渡一帶，一切籌備工作，都在積極進行之中。深望海內資本家踴躍投資使這兩位靑年的事業，得有成功的一天。</p>

<h3 id="c186">蔣雲山氏談國貨在日本商塲 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 徐友文</p>
<p>上月中旬，余因私事走凍京；承蔣雲山先生之邀，赴目黑雅叙園午餐。蔣君留東多年，服務於該園中華料理部；席間爲余述國貨在日所以不能暢銷之癥結，深爲痛心！特記錄蔣君談話，以實本刋，希讀者諸君，注意之。</p>
<p>記者：我國國貨，在日本商場中貿易的情况，想先生很熟悉吧？</p>
<p>蔣君：在以前，日本人對於我國的貨品，常常抱着特殊的優秀觀念：這種觀念，是由於我國物產富饒而發生的！一方面，由貨品質地的耐用，和物類的　賤，驅使了他們採辦的目標，以爲中國貨品，比較了歐美出產的地位高尙。所以；商場貿易，毫無屯滯。最引人注意的，有許多喜飲茶酒的日本人，平常席間，缺了一壺中國酒和中國茶，便一切都不自然起來。國貨在日本的商場，亦便占有了相當地位。</p>
<p>記者：這樣說來，我國貨品在日本，旣如此受人歡迎，銷路　必寬暢；爲什麽近年以來，輸向於日本的數額，却一天不如一天，而致有目下奄奄一息無的生氣呢？</p>
<p>蔣君：這種經營國際貿易者，因爲紛亂得沒有統制，政府亦殊欠顧問，讓他們橫衝直撞；要知道，經營國際貿易，非與國內交易者可比，手續也沒有這樣簡單；商人的重要原則，莫非是信用和廉恥；國際貿易者的信用和廉恥，也就是代表整個國家貿易上的信用和廉恥！我國貨品，在以前受日人歡迎的原因，是所謂價廉物美。一到晚近，因爲商人的貧圖小利，將貨品顚倒是非；這樣一來；信用旣失，即使是眞正美物，又有誰來相信呢？從前，雅叙園的中國貨很多，那般日本人，只須是中國貨，價格的昂貴，在所不顧。於是銷路層層激增，雅叙園的中國貨，亦就被捧至最高地位；現在，商人的信用一失，國家向外貿易的地位和信用，亦隨之動搖！在雅叙園中，我國的貨品，已無人問津；市被堆積在壁角裏了。即使華僑所設商店的營業，也一蹶不振呢！</p>
<p>記者：那麽，我國貨品，不能在日本商場上佔有相當地位的原因，完全是商人人格的腐敗下劣嗎！</p>
<p>蔣君：可不是嗎？回憶我初來日本時，雅叙園中華料理部最暢銷的，便是由上海輸來的黃酒和綠豆燒。當時，日本的貴族階級，一到雅叙園來，非酷飲一次，不足以示富有，那時酒價的高昂和日人的愛好，也可以想見　斑了！後來：商人想博重利，將酒冲了別種的水分，魚目混珠；並且，提高價格，以致失了信用！如今，已將歐美名酒來代替了。這兒如此，別處未嘗不是！商人人格的破裂也就是國家向外貿易上最大的打擊！</p>
<p>記者：聽說日本人處處在留心我國向他們傾銷貨品的原料及製法，一面積極的試騐模仿，以大量的生產，壓低物價，來無形中抵制我國貨品的傾銷。這些，蔣先生留日多年，想來亦很熟悉吧？</p>
<p>蔣君：日本人的與我國貨暗爭的劇烈，的確已成了勢不兩立的。</p>

<p>敎部社會敎育司司長陳禮江、於七日晚在中央廣播電台講積極的社會敎育、其詞如下、</p>
<p>社會敎育的意義</p>
<p>社會敎育是甚麽、迄至現在尙無大家一致承認的定義、與牠類似的名詞也很多、如民眾敎育·成人敎育·通俗敎育·擴充敎育·補習敎育及平民敎育等也常常被人拿來交互應用、所以情形很是複雜、這種不統一的狀況、在少數人看來、以致議論紛紜、花樣百出、其實這種不定於一尊的情狀、正是社會敎育的生機和希望、何以故、我們要知道社會敎育歷史很短、牠的產生不過近一十年的事、我國敎育部添設社會敎育司、是在民國元年開始的、牠是一種新興的事業、一切都要我們去剏造的傳統的敎育幫不了牠多少的忙、牠尙日在演進之中而不能定型化或標準化的、牠是新生的嬰兒、前途是無窮的、牠是剛出的朝日對於人類的貢獻是難以預測的、英國成人敎育專家陪福爾（Peffer）說「要為成人敎育定精確的定義、最好等到成人敎育事業更發達的時候、因為只有事業發達了、我們才能根據事實確定性質、」這話是很對的、在這個正在進展的期間、替社會敎育下定義、自然不是一件容易的事不過為規定工作範圍及指出努力目標起見、似乎最好能有一個定義、本着這個意念、我來替社會敎育下個暫時的定義、</p>
<p>據我的意見、「社會敎育是學校以外的敎育、或說正式學制系統以外的非定式的敎育、」這好像是簡單極了、但為臨時應用起見似無不可、何以說社會敎育是學校以外的敎育呢、這可以現在我國敎育部社會敎育司所掌的事項來說明、社會敎育司分第一第二兩科</p>
<p>第一科掌左列各事項　　關於民眾敎育事項、　關於注音符號及識字運動事項、　關於民眾讀物事項、　關於通俗講演事項、　關於補習敎育事項、關於低能殘廢等特殊敎育事項、　關於國民歷事項、　關於本部圖書館事項、</p>
<p>第二科掌左列各事項、　關於民衆教育館事項、　關於博物館事項、　關於圖書館事項、　關於保存文獻古物事項、　關於美化教育事項、　關於改良風俗及民衆娛樂事項、（公園戲劇電影及民間歌謠風俗等）、　關於公共體育事項、　關於中央教育館事項、這是幾年前的規訂、最近教育播音電影教育勞工教育及特種教育等、也都歸社會教育司職掌、</p>
<p>我們看了上面所列的事項、就可以明白這些教育事業、都是正式學校教育、所不暇及的譬如拿第一科第一項關於民衆教育事項來說罷、我國失學成年民衆佔全國人口百分之八十、但正式學校並沒有供給年長失學民衆一個機會去補受教育、我們的學制系統裏也沒有年老失學民衆的教育及以上所列舉的各項都很重要、一定是要辦的、現在學校旣不理會牠、自然要在學校以外另行設法了、這種在學校以外的教育設施、就是社會教育、（未完）</p>

<p>— （懋德）</p>
<p>克勒吉夫人說：「美國人做事所以會成功，因為不怕失敗，而且心中想着要做的事，必出以全熱誠，赴以全力，簡直想不到有任何的失敗，假使有了失敗，則立刻會站起來，抱着更大的决心，向前奮鬥，到成功而後已。」這話可以做我們的座右銘。</p>
<p>「一寸光陰一寸金，寸金難買寸光陰。」就是說時間的可貴，因為別的東西，失去後，可以復到。獨有光陰，失去一分，就少一分，過了一刻，就失掉一刻，失去以後，任憑你用何力量，終是不能復得。但有許多人，以為今日過去，還有明日，今日的明日，明日的明日，若如此般謬誤的想，把黃金般的時間丟掉，豈不可惜。靑年們！莫再夢想着明日的明日，須抓住現今幹去。否則，鬓髮蒼白，悔已不及了。</p>

<p>— 湖丐</p>
<p>西谿以　雪著，放棹遊賞，咸在霜淸楓熱之際。若春三時節，浮拍于一灣烟水間者，闃寥無幾。余以其地處幽僻，不似湖上輪蹄梭織，黃埃滾滾擾人，因駕言一恣探焉。惟時値農忙，耕桑遍野，烟村疎落，閑居何人？在和家步頭，呼渡移時，始獲一老婦，諾重資往。孤槳初放，鷗點如雪，此景胡可求之于六橋間？數折縈洄，水國幽啟，崛于岸者，新　雜樹，皆藹然而綠；上止數布穀，自相酬呼。稍遠，望阡塍苗油油碧，葚纍纍紫，都堪入畫。間過一二籬落，有犬驚而吠，叱之，岸隨弗休，迄港歧始已。舟抵茭蘆庵，憇于水檻，虛廊坐寂，僅魚蛙自為消息。池中荷腰初挺，萍綠未半，故頭顱墮水，鬓髮猶得分明。折入樊榭祠，一龕香火，供養詩嫗，輒憶碧浪紅帆不止。更西為秋雪庵，倚彈指樓頭，望卅頃蒼盧如自爭翠，眼前生機如此，孰知其入秋而頭都白也？日斜云歸，人影橫藻，眺遠湖暮炊，正冉冉四起。</p>
<h3 id="c235">說人氣味 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 張客</p>
<p>做人必有人所味。人面不相同，而人氣味亦各異。</p>
<p>人氣味發於表者曰：體臭。是臭也，發人人殊，靜而習之靡不辨；率能證諸夫婦之間，以其習相最。嗅焉則臭，千古殊鮮似蘭之馨，乃命之曰：體臭美！其名美，誠以其發自眞元，雖臭亦美也。</p>
<p>人氣味之蓄於裏者，癖嗜是已。人所癖嗜，雅俗邪正不同，美惡凡奇百出，要之各有其氣味可尋，相近者得而相投，相壓者得而相拒，是人性之眞，未始不足謂為癖嗜美也。</p>
<p>允矣！張岱之「記祁止祥癖」曰：「人無癖不可與交，以其無深情也；人無疵不可與交，以其無眞氣也。余友祁止祥有書畫癖，有蹴躅癖，有鼓鐘癖，有鬼戲癖，有梨園癖，……」烏乎，是何人氣味之稠也！</p>
<p>若張獻宗，人知其癖殺人者也。癖之遂大殺而特殺之，是其眞也，而覺其可愛也！</p>
<p>若辜鴻銘，人傳其癖小脚臭者也。固癖之無妨大嗅而特嗅之，是亦其眞也，吾亦覺得其可愛也！</p>
<p>吾同胞之癖捲烟與烏烟者多矣！癖之莫不大抽而特抽之，未嘗或諱，是也，眞也，甚可愛也！乃或以法令所弗禁，而誇說精宏，裝點架子，或以功令之森嚴，則飾言减量，諱莫如深，是皆自湮其眞，吾覺其不甚可愛也夫！</p>
<p>癖嗜之異，有嗜痂者矣，有　　者矣。吾近鄰某氏子，乃自糼嗜鹽，日非食鹽多撮便懨懨似病，壯猶不廢。吾遠鄰某氏女，妙年好貌，乃喜背人咀食拭穢所用之草紙。凡此種種，集之可馬巨帙。其人率以自異於人為恥，諱之雖不甚可愛亦情之常，而不失其為癖。</p>
<p>此所以某社同人戒條：不戒癖好，並不勸人戒烟乎？</p>
<p>夫體而無臭，去死弗遠；人之無癖，與禽獸又奚擇哉？烏乎！此輩缺乏人氣味之　乎！吾大哀之矣！</p>

<p>敗家精，是我們鄉間某大族中所驅除掉的一個可憐的婦人。那已是十三年前的事了。那婦人本是這大族中某一房的四少奶。結婚了三年，伊的丈夫四少爺，便一病不起了。四少爺身後，四壁?然，所遺的，僅是一個才過週歲的兒子。伊的夫兄夫弟，都是自顧不周的，所以對於四少奶，自然是沒甚照顧，那時的四少奶，還只二十一歲。空幃獨守，境况悽凉，不有說了，母子二人的生活，就只靠着義莊中的每年二担米，自然也是不夠的，因了食色的不足，於是便和對門住着的一位春來秋去的茶葉商人，發生了曖昧。</p>
<p>在三四百家的鎭市中，芝蔴大的事兒，都會給人當作新聞傳說的，何况四少奶，是這大族中的媳婦，竟幹出了這种事來，登時的一傳十，十傳百，茶坊酒肆中，都當作新奇的事兒傳說着。於是引起了這大族中族長的憤怒，開了祠堂門，闔族公議着，把伊逐出祠堂，而且押送出境，以保闔族的名譽。從此四少奶的踪跡，便沒人知道，而那茶商，也不再上這鎭市來作買賣了，所留下的，只是一個由二少奶留養着的一個四少爺的　嫡血，和族人所公送給伊一個綽號「敗家精」而已。</p>
<p>光陰很快的溜過了十三年，在今年春天，四少爺的墳上，忽然發現了一個掃祭哀哭的婦人。雖然已經蒼老了些，但大家還都認得是十三年前，被逐的敗家精。原來她自從被逐之後，便跟着那茶商過活，如今那茶商死了，伊分得了三四萬元的遺產，因不忘故劍，所以特來祭掃。這消息，一傳開來，又轟動了全族。聞現已經人調解，捐給祠堂一萬元，不咎旣往，准予復姓了。</p>
<p>這一幕，瞧着似滑稽，但其內面，却有不少的酸辛蘊藏着。</p>
<p>敬吿患黃膽病者　余此次復患黃膽病，遍體皆黃，歷經諸名醫之調治，　不見效。乃荷至友介紹小東門外鹹瓜街一百三十一號義大北貨行王辛南先生，家藏藥草，專治此病，蒙王君慨然見贈，服一星期，病竟霍然。在此期間，並未耗費，心感萬分。現因王君有贈藥濟世之善舉，謹為露佈，以吿同病者。（松卿）</p>

<p>第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍扦　小樓明月夜好夢初溫</p>
<p>夢閱聽了這話却引起了滿腹的心事。這就想着，佳人才子，連不懂也中了這佳人才子的毒。如此想下去，連晚飯也懶得下樓去吃，只叫小菊用開水泡了一飯鍋巴送上樓來，配上一小碟子大頭菜，就當了晚飯了。晚飯以後，在燈下看了兩頁書，也定不下神去。偶然一抬頭，却觀到隔墻的柳條裏面，亮晶晶地，有一團東西，光華奪目。猛然看去，是不免詫異一下，後來仔細看看，正是十六夜月，圓圓的一輪，已湧出多時。那垂柳不像別的樹，有那大的葉子，可以擋住光亮。它被風吹得搖擺着，一閃一閃的，透露出月亮一部分來，却另有一种境趣。還有那當月亮正面的所在，柳條子上，像塗了一層金漆，更是好看。夢蘭先是偶然的一望，現在看得有意思了，索興把桌上的燈給寗息了，然後伏在桌上，只管向天空望裏望着，口裏把舊詩詞，隨便的念着？詩詞雖是隨口念出來的，可是念出來之後，却是傷感的句子佔多，因之對着很淸麗的月景，却也十分不快。自己忽然一轉念，古人說女子善懷，其實是錯誤。中國的女子，為禮敎所壓迫，要做的不能做，要說不能說，除了一個人悶想，那裏還有第二個法子。章唳天在他爭不成雙的那篇小說上，發明了幽怨餘年四個字，那引眞是不　。可惜我不會做小說，我若是會做小說，一定把幽怨餘年四個字做題目，寫一篇女子的痛苦。想到了這裏，手背覺得　麻了一陣，這才醒悟過來，是自己兩手交又着，托了下巴頦向着天空出神，忘了壓着手背了。這倒有點兒疲倦之意，也懒得點燈，掩上房門，就但現在床上出神。頭一落枕，又想到那兩棵高大的垂柳，終日相對，還不曾眞到樹上去盤桓一次。明天起個早，趁那菜園子裏沒有人的時候，去拜訪拜訪這柳樹罷。他有這計　，便是次日的早上，站在兩棵大柳樹下了。昂頭看那柳樹，最高的頂上，密密層層的叠着柳條，簡直看不到天日。不過那太陽並不十分强烈，　像是月亮。口裏就念着古人，月上柳樹梢頭，人約黃昏後的詩句接着便聽到身后有人道：這也是幽怨餘年的話吧？回頭看時，却是在雨花台遇到的那少年？他手上還拈了一小枝杏花，點頭笑道：這花就送給你　。（　三）</p>

<h3 id="c240">鐵甲車下的中國人 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 林儷琴</p>
<p>烏賽伏洛特伊凡諾夫Vsevolod　I　anoy是蘇俄的現代極享盛譽的作家，在他的許多作品裏面，有一部描寫大革命時代的農民游擊隊襲擊鐵甲車的小說：「鐵甲車」The　Armoured　Train尤其算得是他的最出色的代表作．一九三二年土耳其的新聞記者和作家們，去訪問蘇俄的文藝界，在第二次會見高爾基的時候，高爾基應土耳其的來賓們之請，特指出這部「鐵甲車」介紹給他們，並稱許是値得注意的現代蘇俄的文學作品．著名的批評家柯根敎授也曾在他的「偉大的十年間文學」中加以榮譽的推崇．這部被公認為傑出的小說，世界各國差不多都有了譯本，而且還編成了戲劇搬演至舞台上；在蘇俄，導演「鐵甲車」的是當代的大導演斯坦利斯拉夫斯基Stanislavskvo一九三三年蘇俄的戲劇節—六月一日—十日，在舉國狂歡的第三個夜晚，「鐵甲車」被演出在世界著名的莫斯科「藝術大劇場」，扮演書中農民游擊隊參謀長凡爾斯希寗的，是卡訖洛夫Kacbalov大戲劇家。美國的「巴沙代那劇社」也會表演過好多次的。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們一則因為「鐵甲車」是世界文學名作，二則因為我們這素來被外國人輕蔑的中國人，在這部書裏多謝作者給予我們以一個優越的位置；並且還加以「中國的龍」的尊稱，我們受了意外的光寵愈覺侥倖；在那許多革命戰士之中，居然會有這樣一位使俄羅斯人崇拜慚愧的勇敢剛烈的英雄—中國人沈方吾，這雖然是友邦作家假想中的人物，我們的民族性實際能否酬答他們的友善的賜予；這個，我們時刻在憧憬着的，誠然孕育那一般的希望，所以我們尤其應當鄭重地，來提出這們鐵甲車下的中國人：</p>
<p>關於沈方吾的事蹟，照原書的叙述，我們可以簡潔地轉叙一點在這裏：他—沈方吾，是一個編織蓆子的旅俄僑工，或許由於刻苦儉節的緣故，使他有一個妻子，一所住房和一片高梁和玉蜀黍的田；不幸在一天之內他的莊田家產被Imperlatism者的砲火毀滅了，一切都消失了；他憤恨他的敵人，因而同情革命——投身到農民游擊隊裏追隨大鼻子濃鬍鬚的俄羅斯人，在凡爾斯希寗的指揮之下當一名偵察兵。當奈賓拉素夫上尉統帶的一四六九號「極地」鐵甲車奉令開往佛拉齊伏斯多克去鎭壓城裏的將爆發的叛變時，革命委員會主席泊克列伐諾夫便命令凡爾斯希寗統領着他的農民游擊隊到莫克連加河的鐵路綫上去攔擊這一列鐵甲車，阻斷牠的前進。在凡爾斯希寗之方面，自從接到這一道命令之後，就有人獻議掘毀路軌，可是一經考慮到目前沒有人力可以修復的困難；凡爾斯希寗更改為徵求一個志願者，要他躺在鐵軌上，讓鐵甲車的車輪軋過他的身體，那末鐵甲車照規則準會停下來，車上的統帶和司機人也準會走下來檢視這軌死了的屍體而準備做一個報吿，經過這樣的一週折，攔擊的戰略不僅容易得手，也許這樣就可以奪過那一列戰鬥力最强的「極地」鐵甲車。後來因為沒有一個人願意把他的肉體去接觸鋼鐵的車輪，那個軍需長奥考洛克憤怒了，他便丟了手裏的槍橫倒在鐵軌的上面，雖然掙扎着最後的勇氣準備把他的肉和血獻給了鋼鐵，預為戰略而犧牲；但是在那將死前的死亡的恐佈終有點使他發生戰慄。在這嚴重緊張的剎那間，我們那位自從行軍以來態度就很冷靜的中國人沈方吾却奮發起來了。他覺得那個奥考洛克橫躺在鐵軌上向農民們討伏特加酒喝是畏怯可恥的，他便哂笑着跑過去躺在奥考洛克的身旁，在奥考洛克帶着罪人的微笑悄悄地離開鐵軌時，如同火燄一般燃燒的革命的熱情便愈加堅定了他的犧牲的决心，一四六九號「極地」鐵甲車還沒有駛到之前，他先舉起了手槍向自己的後腦上開了一槍，便使勁地躺在鐵軌上等待着車輪的轔磔。於是凡爾斯希寗的擊車的戰功，佛拉齊伏斯多克城裏的叛變的爆發，最後的勝利是屬於我們的那位「鐵甲車下的中國人」。</p>
<p>起如伊凡諾夫的「鐵甲車」可以算得眞確的信史，那麽在蘇俄的革命戰爭歷史裏，我們那位鐵甲車下的中國人沈方吾，也許算不得是一顆　爚的巨星。如果轉回來展開我們自己的中國革命戰爭史：從孫總理組織「興中會」倡義發端，而黃花崗之役，而武昌起義；以及國民革命軍北伐中若干次偉大悲壯的浴血之戰，和那可歌可泣的「一二八」的光榮的戰爭，在這期間，等於「鐵甲車下的中國人」沈方吾的，將數不盡有多少的的使俄羅斯人崇拜慚愧的勇敢剛烈的英雄。但是，榮譽的種籽是奮勉，誇耀的背面也許是激勵；起來吧，鐵甲車下的中國人！歷史的餘頁在期待着燦爛的記錄呢。</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>前日有幾位朋友，到北平去旅行，朋友回來，我問他們此行印象如何？感想若何？他說我們此行，共有二百餘人，天天走馬看花，跟了阿媽吃喜酒似的，完全得不到這麼印象和感想，不過覺得封建思想的遺毒，仍舊充滿着故都的空氣中，此外相戒不談政治，一若無形中有一種惡劣與兇殘的勢力，籠罩於各個人的腦筋中，胸中的氣為之窒塞而已。</p>
<p>不過有一事，足為足下告者，我輩於日間旅行之後，在寓中休憩，侍者問曰，諸君欲抽大烟乎？余為之驚奇而問曰，此地大烟絕不禁止乎？侍者答曰，否，他處不可抽，如往石頭胡同萬里香去抽，則决無問題也。余初不解其意，卽偕友人前往，入門，卽見掌櫃者有小鬍子一名，儼　在座，余方知此處抽烟所以决無問題的理由，卽在於此也。</p>
<p>入其室，則縱橫烟榻，不下七八十具，生意十分興隆，吞雲吐霧，毒氛滿室，我輩本無烟癮，一爲消遣，一欲瞻仰北平新發生之奇跡而已，事畢而返，侍者曰，如何？從前北平祗要有某親王某王爺撑腰，無論什麼事，便不會鬧亂子，現在祗要有小鬍子撑腰，無論犯法干紀的事，多可以去幹，萬里香的組織，資本並不是小鬍子的，小鬍子不過是似們的擋風牌，現在這里祇要有小鬍子出塲，便一些沒事，余聞言，不禁爲之慨然。</p>
<p>我聞小鬍子在北方，販賣毒品，聚賭抽頭，收刮民財，已爲他們正當職業，我想根本上，還是自己不好，假使他們販毒，我們不去吃他們的毒品，則彼亦無可奈何，假使他們聚賭抽頭，我們不想去發財，他們亦無可奈何，現在他們做不法的營業，居然生意興隆，歸根結底，多是我們自已的不好，此其一，此外更有一般漢奸走狗，惟利是圖，爲虎作倀，借小鬍子爲招牌，而實行自殺自滅　政策，我國之所以不救，卽在於此也。</p>
<p>卽如近日走私　事，我國人若稍有人心，此種走私的貨物，欲禁止他們，辦法原極便當，祗要商人不為他賣，國人不要去買，就這兩句話，卽使他們走私，而私亦無法可走，抵制辦法，原極簡單，無如商人利欲薰心，國人不知愛國，我國的事，所以愈弄而愈糟也。現在遏止辦法，欲用良心制裁，而良心已不可靠，欲用法律制裁，而國法亦有所不可及，果眞無法以處此耶？抑尚有辦法，審愼顧慮而不肯用耶？</p>
<p>噫我聞千里香三字，而不禁為之惶然恐！愕然驚！</p>
<h3 id="c242">原野上 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 李勸文</p>
<p>月夜，沒有風，銀色的流液鋪滿了整個拉比原野。</p>
<p>原野是廣大平蕩的，無涯的伸展到遠方的黑暗裏。望不到棚屋，望不到樹影，也望不到田畝，祇有葱靑一片的牧草顯露着這裏的唯一的財富。</p>
<p>我們輕鞭着，馬匹輾過雨後乾了的崎嶇的泥路前進。車輪的沒有節拍的響聲，偶然的車上的豬鼾和我們的間或的談話單調地擊破了原野的岑寂。</p>
<p>我們是原野的熟客：每隔十天我們就要半夜裏動身，輾過這一片原野趕到幾十哩外鎭上的市集裏去。</p>
<p>起先，這原是對我有了憎惡與懊悔的職業，但不允我便很快地習慣了牠；以至於在常常的碰不到伴侶的孤獨的行程裏，也會很安靜地利用了默思和夜的景色調劑了自己。</p>
<p>這趟我的伴侶是種靑菜的巴達威亞人。我們是在剛要轉入這原野的一條三岔路口集遇的。我們雖然是陌生者，但尤如趕集者都有的慣例：由於遼遠而孤獨的夜行茁發出來的同情很快地便把我們聯成一片了。他是二畝地的租賃者，是一個傷感的中年人，談話很少，而且每一句吐出的話也煌染着很濃的感傷。不過，很容易明白的，他也有一個希望，甚且熱烈地在守侯着那希望之火點的燃燒。雖然那希望的生長也不過是感傷灌漑出來的。</p>
<p>我是易受感動的神經質過量豐富的人，他的傷感不由衷地很快的便沾透了我；我在感傷的暝想中也不知不覺的慢慢地泛起了過去的掙扎與未來的懸慮。</p>
<p>「這世界」！我想着不覺噓了口氣。</p>
<p>「大叔（註一），辛苦了吧？」</p>
<p>「我們還有什麽苦的感覺呢，這世界：唉唉，我們原是苦裏長出來的野草呀！」</p>
<p>我把馬鞭輕輕地揚起在空中一揮，發出了淸脆的劈力爆聲：偶然車上的豬也在熟睡中噴出了含糊不淸的呻吟一般的鼾息，但馬上死寂又在四下裏包攏了來，剩下車輪的聲響機械地向四野盪送</p>
<p>我重復埋入了沉思中，欷獻與憤懣在壓迫民族的鐵蹄的踐踏下。……</p>
<p>「大叔！」我的伴侶突然驚醒了安睡着的岑寂和我的沉思。「你想我們也有抬頭的日子嗎」？</p>
<p>「哦！堅壁也有牠坍毀的時候呢，一朝我們的力量够了我們也就爬得上梯子了！」</p>
<p>「但是，大叔，……」</p>
<p>「弱小民族已在炫目的陽光下逐漸睜開他們的眼睛了；你聽見過燎原的大火可以用桶了裏的水安靜牠的嗎？」</p>
<p>「但是！唔，在什麽一個時候呢？大叔，你以爲。」</p>
<p>「也許在後天，也許總有一個時候，我們爬得上梯子的呀！」</p>
<p>「就是那樣想的呀，我也是大叔！」</p>
<p>我的伴侶的馬匹忽然漲起鼻音尖癎地呌了起來，我的灰馬跟着也用牠那冗長的像是鼻子裏捲起舌頭抖出來的呌聲相和着；這呌聲最初在左近的空中打滾，慢慢地向原野裏四面飄開而終於消逝在遠方的無邊無際的黑暗裏；但彷彿仍有一絲絲的微弱的餘音從遠處彈盪回來，依舊在耳邊繚繞似的。</p>
<p>「那一年：我們成功了才和呢，那一年！（註二）」</p>
<p>我的伴侶戚慨地獨語着；把手裏的馬鞭在空中搖了又搖，却始終不會揮過一下。</p>
<p>「那也算得好炸彈呵；你們的同胞不是因此嚇醒了好多嗎？」</p>
<p>「但是，大叔，防範的也越發利害了呢！」</p>
<p>「河堤規範不了汹湧澎湃的洪水，棚欄也是攔不住會飛的鳥禽的呀！你知道！」</p>
<p>「不過，浸在麻木裏的也像蒼蠅那樣多呵！大叔。」</p>
<p>「泳塊落在熱水裏也是慢慢地才溶開的！有誰看見過一次就上好顏色的畫象呢？」</p>
<p>「呀！大叔！你想的同我一樣呀！眞是一個腦子裏出來的！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>豬又在噴出牠含糊不淸的囈語：路上一個更低窪的地方使我的車子略為劇烈的震動了一下。</p>
<p>「總有一個時候我們爬得上梯子的總有那樣的一天！」</p>
<p>我的伴侶拖長地嘆了口氣，說到末尾「一天」兩個字時更用力把馬鞭在空中揮了幾揮：尖銳的劈力聲使得他的馬匹受驚而老快了幾步。</p>
<p>言時車輪循着道路在原野上轉了一個大灣。來路在右方成了個很整齊的曲尺形。</p>
<p>原野依舊歸到了寂靜。我們都緘默着，各向跳進了沉思的池子，默默地讓車輪以牠那沒有節拍的響聲單調地擊破着無邊的岑寂把我們載向遠方的黑暗鑽進。……</p>

<p>— 林加</p>
<p>在吃晚飯以前，暮色蒼茫中，有一個細高漢子鹵莽的走進屋來。這人我一看就認識，那是兩年前僱在我們這村裏的看門的槍手，西莊裏牟三的兒子。據說這兩年在家裏以捕魚打野鳥為生，樣子顯得比當看門人時憔悴黑瘦子一點，兩年來這世界給與他的風霜與折磨好像不少。</p>
<p>父親是鄉長，這時正穿着公務人員制服，斜欹在炕上用長烟袋吸烟。這漢子侷促的坐在炕沿上，無心的回答了幾句旁人的問話以後，就鄭重得不自然的說道：</p>
<p>「鄉長，我是被程望咬着了？」</p>
<p>一時全室寂然，程望的案子我們是都很熟悉的，那是一個閧動一方的謀財的殺人犯，前幾天才和血衣一起被人綁着胳膊牵到城裏去了。</p>
<p>父親用左嘴角慢慢的噓出了一道長長的烟縷，沒有表情的說道：</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道了？」</p>
<p>「今日那莊為村長到俺家去說：某人，程望咬着你啦，你如果不想到案也得有不想到案的打算！—他先來了這麼個大哈山，待了回又鬼鬼祟祟的說：我看你還是跑吧，要你爺拿出幾塊錢來，我給你打點打點。」</p>
<p>他有點喘粗氣，稍微一頓就更激昂的說：</p>
<p>「鄉長，你想他這是說的什麽話！這豈不是硬栽贓？我爲什麽跑？我跑哪裏去？憑空裏咱又沒犯罪……」</p>
<p>父親仍保持着他的沉默，這沈默使那漢子有點窘，他悄悄的換了換氣又說：</p>
<p>「我特勁來問問怎麼回事？領領鄉長的教，這事應該怎麼辦？」</p>
<p>父親向他翻了翻眼皮，像把他放在等盤子秤秤的樣子說道：</p>
<p>「你真沒有事嗎？」</p>
<p>他一下子站了起來：</p>
<p>「鄉長，咱天然沒有事，我僱在這莊裏過，又不是摸不著我的脾氣，咱窮不錯，可是窮得耿直，為搶錢而殺人的事咱幹不出來。」</p>
<p>父親又那麼不動聲色的說道：</p>
<p>「真沒事就好。不過賊咬一口入骨三分，你也得認晦氣。」</p>
<p>他臨走的時候，一個長工在包一包槍藥，他搭訕着說：</p>
<p>「什麽？槍藥？」</p>
<p>「嗯，今天弄了個野鴨子，白白的沒打着！」那長工很帶神氣的說着。</p>
<p>「那東西不稀罕，再一天我打了送幾個來。」</p>
<p>說着他就脚步稀稀的走了出去。</p>
<p>他走後，父親用烟袋鍋子磕着炕幫說道：</p>
<p>「也不是好東西，麻麻六六的！」</p>
<p>我說：「村長也不好，想敲他的竹槓。」</p>
<p>父親的唇動了動，可是沒有說話。</p>
<p>第二天傍晚，我正在屋裏映着紙窗讀書，忽然聽着母親在院子裏喊道：</p>
<p>「卡，你來看，牟大生打來的水鴨子！」</p>
<p>我跑出去，看見那漢子站在月台上，一致長長的鳥槍，倚在門旁的磚垛子，兩雙美麗的野鴨子蜷伏在他的脚下，母親正弓着腰，微笑的審視着。</p>
<p>母親說：</p>
<p>「這東西真好看，活栩栩的怎麼吃下去！養着不行？」</p>
<p>「唉，還吃不下去，」他不自然的笑着「太太快炒炒吃了吧，這東西很香比雞肉還好，拿着好的時候我再送來養着，　些都打壞了。」</p>
<p>兩雙小東西，不安的爬在地上，翠色的，淡黃色的，銀白色的羽毛配合成美麗的花紋。扁而長的嘴，弓曲的　子，組成了一種新奇的形狀。有一隻的翅膀上殷殷的冒着鮮血。我被一種喜歡與憐憫的心情支配着。</p>
<p>爲了要了解這終年打鳥的漢子的心情，我把視線移到這漢子的臉上，他那黑乾憔瘦的臉子半仰着，正惘然的再傍晚的春風裏出神。我忽然記起了昨天晚上的他那心事，像突然受了一種莫名的打擊。</p>
<p>我默默的退回屋子裏去，又聽見他跟母親絮叨起他昨天晚所談的那段事。</p>

<p>這是浴塲。門面也掛着像「燒鳥」的布簾，不過那些布簾是淸潔的，雖然那布地也是一樣淡藍色的居多。斜排地綴在那些布簾上的字也特別大，前後兩字（御字和屋）也是用字母寫的。不過，縱使沒有那標記也不會誤認為裏面做什麽食物生意的。因為那門血寬敞而潔淨，特別那屋頂高高的聳起。同時上午十一時特別是下午五六時以後，如果你從門前或者從旁側走過的時候，像敲木魚似的裏面的木盆子和堅硬的土　碰擊的聲音會高或低地傳到你的耳朵來。</p>
<p>如果是初來人的話，而且抱着自尊的羞怯心的話，當你走進那正堂門時，請　抬望一下那兩入口上面寫的是「男」或「女」字而决定自己進去的方向。入口處都有一兩位男子或女子招呼你，把你脫下的木屐（靴也是一樣）放在旁邊的架上，而且先給你一塊大刀牌香烟型的上面寫着號數的木牌子，你走時可憑牠領回你的所有物。一進去，位在兩個場面的前頭的正中，有一個高高的台，那台上坐着一位男或者女的老板。他们除了接收你「五錢」入塲費或保管存放的什麽貴重東西外，老是閒坐着望望這塲面得男人或那塲面的女人，至多當你進來時呌句：「伊列勢！」出門時呌句：「亞里額特！」（謝謝！）</p>
<p>你給過錢便踏上鋪砌着蓆的地板上時，有姑娘招呼你，把籘簍拿到（自己拿也可以）你的跟前給你脫放衣服。你就那麼赤條條的拿着自己帶來的浴巾和香　走進浴塲裏去。那裏有木盆子，壁上伸出許多冷熱水頭，那麼你便會使木盆子和那水頭做着怎樣的動作了。你可以盆一盆的把暖水往身上直淋，跟着你往裏面的熱水槽盡量的浸，不管額和臉上的汗像瀑布般流，聽說任牠多多地流了才最合衛生。你認為滿意了時，那麼你就跨出那槽來，直往先前的位置做你洗澡的工作，如果留戀那槽裏的熱水，再浸幾次也沒有誰干涉的。假如你想再寫意點也可以，裏面有專任椎背的人，聽說要多給五錢菜給你這寫意。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong and Guangxi armies have issued mobilization orders. The Canton-Hankou and Canton-Kowloon Railways are extremely busy transporting new weapons and equipment to the front lines. Wu Jianxiong's vanguard force has reached Binzhou. Huang Zhiwen's division stationed in Shaozhou is stationed at Xiaobeijiang. Li Zhenliang's division will immediately advance into Hunan. Chen Zhang's brigade from Nanxiong has also returned to Shaozhou and is transferring to Hunan. Fortifications are being added to the east and west rivers of Shaozhou. The Executive Department discussed the current situation on the 9th. Regarding the convening of the Second Plenary Session, no expression was made for the time being due to not receiving official documents. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) On the 9th, Miao Peinan still requested leave from the headquarters due to incomplete recovery of his health. Chen Jitang dispatched Zhang Huaru to Dongjiang to supervise the completion of various highways. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Council dispatched Yang Xiji to Hunan on the 9th to meet with He Jian. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Long Yun's representative, Li Yunhu, went to Lin on the 9th to meet with He Jian. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The 1st and 3rd squadrons of the air force stationed in Shaozhou were ordered by Chen Jitang on the 9th to fly to the province for reorganization. Bai Chongxi departed for northern Guangxi. Li Jishen, under the order of Li Zongren, arrived at Yongzhen on the 8th. Hu Zongduo left Guangdong on the 8th for Guangxi to assist in military affairs. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Guangzhou correspondent for the English-language South China Morning Post, several people have been meeting at Chen Jitang's private residence in recent days. Chen explained to them the Southwest's attitude towards Nanjing and Japan. The qualifications of these representatives are not fully known, but many believe that these people are mostly military leaders who lost power during the old government era, hoping to take advantage of the situation to seek their own interests. However, according to observers with well-informed sources, most of the provincial leaders firmly support the central government and will not deviate under any circumstances. At the same time, according to news from Nanning, the Guangxi Military Headquarters has issued a Guangxi army mobilization order. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) In recent days, due to the official mobilization of the Guangxi army, the concentration of the Guangxi army at a certain location 40 miles inside Hunan province, the deteriorating crisis of Guangdong paper currency, and the Guangdong authorities' engagement in a vigorous anti-Japanese propaganda movement, the unrest caused by the clamor of the Southwest anti-Japanese army has become increasingly volatile today. Although Guangxi generals have repeatedly declared their pro-war sentiments, many Chinese observers here remain skeptical as to whether there is a deep hatred between Guangxi and Japan. It is said that Guangxi employs Japanese advisors; as far as is known, these advisors are still serving in Guangxi. Guangxi has also repeatedly purchased cement, aircraft, machinery, bullets, and other items from Japan. Furthermore, Japan often raises protests over minor matters elsewhere in China. However, in the past few weeks, the Southwest's anti-Japanese attitude has been quite intense, yet Japan has remained silent. This point is also noteworthy. People here generally believe that Guangdong province has a calm attitude towards the current movement, but it has been dragged in due to its friendly and bordering relationship with Guangxi. Therefore, it is believed that this struggle will ultimately become purely a matter between Nanjing and Guangxi, with Guangdong province merely standing in the rear to observe. Today, 1,783 yuan of Guangdong currency is equivalent to 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have successively ordered huge amounts of military supplies from Japan. The Guangdong side purchased supplies worth 30 million yuan, with 20 million silver dollars already paid. The Guangxi side purchased supplies worth 20 million yuan. Guns, artillery, ammunition, etc., have already been transported into the province, but have not yet been paid for, and are on long-term credit. (9th Shen Shi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Cranborne replied to a question in the House of Commons today, saying that there has recently been tension between the southwestern provinces of China and the central government, but at present, there seems to be no cause for alarm regarding the overall situation. He said that talks are underway between the ambassador and Nanjing, and between the Chinese and Japanese governments. The Japanese government has dispatched an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the truth. It is heard that the Japanese garrison in North China is increasing. Apart from this, there have been no changes in the overall situation in North China. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Guangdong's Financial Crisis is Critical; The Market is Completely Stalled <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Due to the financial crisis, ordinary commerce in Guangzhou cannot be conducted. Importers have stopped ordering goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong. The future of the market depends on the development of the political situation. This afternoon, 1,782 yuan of Guangdong currency is equivalent to 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. The Guangdong government has banned the purchase of forward Hong Kong dollars. Speculators have greatly decreased, so the price of Guangdong currency has fluctuated little, but the market has completely stalled. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram received here today from Guangzhou stated that due to political reasons, the financial crisis in Guangzhou is worsening, with the risk of overall bankruptcy. Commerce is at a standstill, banks are avoiding transactions, and the Guangzhou Finance Department has ordered a ban on speculative purchases of Hong Kong dollars, hoping to save the financial crisis by this measure, and has stipulated that 172 yuan of Guangdong currency is equivalent to 100 Hong Kong dollars. Today, the market price of Guangdong currency is 178.3 yuan equivalent to 100 Hong Kong dollars. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">London Morning Post Criticizes the Situation in South China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the Morning Post published a commentary criticizing the situation in South China, blaming Guangzhou politicians for endangering peace in the Far East again, the reason for which is nothing more than venting their anger. The newspaper said that if Guangzhou politicians were in power in Nanjing, they would not be able to deal with Japan better than Chiang Kai-shek, because China's current situation makes it impossible to resist aggression. Chiang Kai-shek's friendliness with Japan does not mean that he does not love the country. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already done so before. If Guangzhou politicians were in the same position, thinking of China's current happiness, they would also do the same. If Guangzhou's actions only related to Chiang Kai-shek's personal position, we would not care about the strategy of Nanjing and Guangdong. However, the dangerous impact of this strategy will exceed the power of responsible politicians. Guangzhou's stubbornness will restore the trust of Japanese militarists, allowing them to insist again on implementing rapid action in China. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Sun Ke's Opinion on the Current Situation: Unified Steps to Save the Country; If the Guangdong and Guangxi Authorities Have Opinions, They Can Be Submitted to the Second Plenary Session for Discussion <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 9th, reporters visited Sun Ke to inquire about his views on the current situation. Sun first said that the state funeral of former Chairman Hu and the convening of the Second Plenary Session will both be specifically decided by the Central Standing Committee this week. Regarding the statement that Guangdong and Guangxi intend to act independently on national affairs, Sun believes that it remains to be observed and studied. Sun also said that in the spirit of modern politics, national policies are determined, and one cannot rely solely on subjective opinions, but should especially understand objective facts. Relying solely on subjective opinions is only enough to express one's inner tendencies. It not only has no practical benefit to the country and the nation, but is also enough to disperse national power and promote national demise. If the method of application is even contrary to the inner tendencies, it will be even more abandoned by the people of the country. If one can understand objective facts, take unified steps, and act in an organized manner, to jointly seek to resolve national crises, there will naturally be a day of success. Sun added that when he was in Guangdong, he had, in a personal capacity, frankly advised the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities that if they had any opinions on national affairs, he would be willing to present them to the central government on their behalf, hoping to realize them, and that they should not act hastily and disrupt the steps. Today, he again sent a telegram to the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities with this intention, urging them to prioritize the preservation of national vitality, and that all opinions can be submitted to the Second Plenary Session for discussion. He deeply hopes that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities can accept his opinions. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">After the Southwest Issued a Circular Telegram, Chairman Chiang Replied to Chen Jitang by Telegram: War and Peace are Major Issues for the Party and the Nation and Should Seek the Opinions of All; He Hopes to Send Responsible Personnel to Beijing to Discuss Everything Together <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the Southwest issued the Dong (2nd) Zhi (4th) two telegrams, Chairman Chiang sent a Yang (7th) telegram to Chen Jitang, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"The soldiers and civilians of Guangdong and Guangxi are heartbroken by the national crisis and determined to resist insults. With a united determination to save the country, they have made a generous request for battle. All Chinese people are moved. However, in recent days, various telegrams have been spreading, all saying that preparations have been made for independent action, and there are also rumors of reorganizing establishments and mobilizing troops. As far as I can see, I dare to assert that the rumors are inaccurate. Today, to save the country and survive, we must use the entire national power and take unified steps. If plans are not determined, and one corner takes the lead, then the dignity of the entire country will have already been lost internationally. Those who insult us will increase their contempt, and those who love us will also be upset. This is from the standpoint of the country. I know that you will definitely not bear to lower the country's status and reduce its external strength in the name of saving the country. From the perspective of military principles, any military action must be under the entire order and coordinated to be effective. According to historical examples of international warfare, even among allied forces, there must be detailed consultations beforehand, and then practical communication during the event, in order to accomplish the task under the entire strategy. You are all deeply aware of these theorems and rules. If there is no prior consultation and a call to arms is suddenly issued, I know that you will definitely not disregard these military principles and lose the position of our country's soldiers. Moreover, war and peace are major issues for the party and the country. How can we not seek the opinions of the entire majority and gamble the permanent survival of the nation on a moment of excitement? In recent days, rumors have been spreading on the roads, and doubts have arisen among the people. Those who do not understand even say that Guangdong and Guangxi's actions, as reported by foreign media, are no less than the opposite result of saving the country in the name of resisting insults. I deeply know that you are sincere in your love for the country, and will definitely not show people the weakness of division and inconsistency. In recent days, the mobilization of troops must not enter the borders of neighboring provinces, so as not to start internal and external doubts and hinder the entire plan. I also hope that you will send responsible personnel to Beijing to jointly discuss everything. The country's situation is like this, there is no reason to preserve only one part. The central government's determination to save the country is no different from yours. I hope that all views can be seen clearly. I sincerely offer this, and please pass it on to De Lin and Jian Sheng, etc." (9th Shen Shi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Yang Dezhao Telegraphed Guangdong Reporting on Meeting with Chiang <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Yang Dezhao met with President Chiang yesterday and presented Chen Jitang's handwritten letter, he telegraphed Guangdong to report on the process. On the 9th, Yang separately met with President Sun and Huang Shaoxiong, etc., and held discussions. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 10th. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong returned to Hangzhou by car at noon on the 9th, and will still come to Beijing. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, the actions of Guangdong and Guangxi are not as severe as reported by foreign media. The central government had previously telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to inquire about their true opinions. In recent days, there have been telegraphic exchanges between Beijing and Guangdong. The British telegram's claim that Guangdong and Guangxi troops have arrived in southern Hunan province for military occupation is difficult to confirm. It is rumored that Central Committee member Zhang Ji, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, and Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong will visit the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities in a personal capacity to exchange views on the current situation. Some say that this matter has not been decided yet, while others say that it has already passed. Hunan Chairman He Jian sends telegrams to Beijing at any time to report. Yang Dezhao plans to visit Chiang again within days, and his trip to Shanghai on the 10th will be postponed. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The 10th was the date for the regular meeting of the Central Political Committee.

<h3 id="e13">Leith-Ross Goes to Japan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British economic envoy to China, has been in China to investigate the economy and politics since last autumn, and it has been more than half a year. Recently, after Ross returned from North China to investigate the smuggling problem, he left Shanghai for Japan on the 31st of last month. These days, he is meeting with the Japanese diplomatic and financial authorities to exchange views on the China issue. According to what Ross told reporters of the Allied Press on the ship, the purpose of his decision to visit Japan is because he had made various earnest talks with the Japanese authorities before coming to China last year, and there were still some points that had not been understood, so he decided to discuss them again. He will adjust the interests of Japan and China, and Japan and Britain from the standpoint of a third party. Regarding the economic and financial reconstruction of China, he believes that it can be done if Japan cooperates. Ross also said that he has brought some draft plans for this decision to visit Japan. From this conversation, it can be seen how important Ross's trip is to China.</p>
<p>Ross is originally a financial advisor to the British government, and is known for his handling of economic issues. He not only has rich experience, but also has the resourceful methods. He was dispatched to China last autumn with the important task of saving the British Far East interests that were severely hit by the advance of Japan's continental policy. When he first came to the Far East, he first visited the Japanese authorities, wanting to agree with Japan on how to divide the interests in China, but he was rejected by Japan. Later, he made considerable achievements in investigating the economy in China. Recently, due to the severity of the smuggling situation in North China, British interests in China have been greatly affected, so he was again ordered by the British government to go to Japan to "adjust the interests of Japan and China, and Japan and Britain from the standpoint of a third party."</p>
<p>Can Ross's decision to visit Japan avoid repeating the previous mistakes and achieve considerable success? The answer to this question depends on Japan's attitude. On the surface, Japan's attitude towards Ross's decision to visit Japan is much better than before. When Ross decided to visit Japan last time, the Japanese authorities did not express a welcome at all, but this time the atmosphere has eased a lot, and even the army authorities have given it a sympathetic welcome. The reason for this is that "Ross has changed his original opinions as a result of his meticulous study of the Chinese economy for half a year in China, and realized that without Japan's cooperation, the Chinese economy and all other problems cannot be satisfactorily resolved, and thus realized that the UK's desired situation in China can only be realized if China and Japan cooperate" (see Allied Press Tokyo dispatch on the 5th). However, in reality, the future of the British-Japanese talks cannot be so optimistic. First, the Japanese government held a foreign, sea, and land three-phase meeting on the 5th of this month and decided on the following attitude: "Japan has a special relationship with China, especially in North China. Because it is necessary to consider the relationship between China, Japan, and 'Manchukuo' and Japan's position for the security of East Asia, Japan cannot handle the smuggling problem in North China and all other problems from an economic standpoint alone like Britain. Therefore, Japan cannot discuss specific matters with Ross's trip." Second, Japan is currently vigorously pursuing a continental policy and has already made great achievements. At this time, it is by no means willing to let Britain share the fat meat at its mouth. This can be seen from the conversation of Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing. Suma told Japanese reporters in Kobe when he returned to Japan the other day: "China has only two paths to take with Japan: either to maintain each other or to fight. Japan cannot retreat in any way. If it retreats a step, it would be tantamount to a general retreat. Japan must embrace unchangeable self-confidence and move forward." Third, when Ross went to Japan last year, British territories in the Far East were vigorously rejecting Japanese goods, causing great resentment in Japan, but when Ross decided to go to Japan this time, Australia announced an increase in import tariffs on Japanese goods, causing the relationship between the two countries to deteriorate. From the above three points, it can be seen how the future of the British-Japanese talks will be.</p>
<p>Regardless of the future of the British-Japanese talks, the result will always be harmful to China's interests, because imperialists can hardly have genuine sympathy and help for weak nations. When people are colluding to conspire against us, what should we do to plan a way to deal with it?</p>

Luo Guolang was carried to Anlu Hospital for treatment, but died on the 4th due to the severity of his injuries. After the incident, the nearby garrison heard the news and immediately dispatched a team to encircle and suppress the bandits. It is heard that several bandits have been captured. The northern Hubei automobiles are still operating normally without hindrance. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, economic advisor to the British government, and Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to Japan, held a two-hour meeting today with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Horiuchi. Ross strongly stated that China, Britain, and Japan should cooperate with each other based on economic interests. Arita strongly stated the political importance of Sino-Japanese relations, involving the survival of Japan as a nation. Ross continued, saying that China's economic recovery could greatly benefit all countries, and hoped that the major powers would assist China in building railways. Arita replied that the matter of building railways in China required serious consideration, as providing economic assistance to China was closely related to China's political security. It is reported that Arita expressed his agreement with Ross's opinions on the reform of the Chinese banking system. (Ninth, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 3:00 PM on the 9th, Frederick Leith-Ross, accompanied by the British Ambassador to Japan, Robert Clive, visited Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence. Vice Minister Horiuchi also participated. The discussion lasted for two hours, ending at 5:00 PM. A record of their questions and answers is as follows:</p>
<p>General Questions</p>
<p>(Arita) Now that your assessment of the situation in China is complete, it is most timely that you visit Japan and confer with people from various circles before returning home. I believe this is most appropriate for enhancing understanding between Britain and Japan.</p>
<p>(Ross) It is regrettable that there are various misunderstandings about my mission among people in Japan. My activities in China are not solely for the benefit of Britain. If China's economy recovers, the purchasing power of the general public will increase. Britain, Japan, the United States, and other countries that have relations with China will also reap economic benefits.</p>
<p>Currency System Reform</p>
<p>(Ross) Since its implementation last November, China's silver nationalization currency system reform has gradually become smooth and developed. I believe that even without foreign assistance, it can maintain the system on its own.</p>
<p>(Arita) Given the situation as it stands today, it may be possible to make such an optimistic observation. However, whether it will be able to maintain the existing system in the future is doubtful.</p>
<p>Economic Aid</p>
<p>(Arita) Economic aid to China is closely related to the stability of the political situation in China and requires careful consideration. Regarding the operation of Chinese railways with foreign capital, it is necessary to conduct a concrete review to determine whether it possesses any degree of economic certainty, otherwise a conclusion cannot be reached.</p>
<p>(Ross) What are your views on the issue of the central bank? I would like to hear your opinion.</p>
<p>(Arita) I feel the same way regarding the purpose, but economic aid to China needs to have the stability of the domestic and international political situation, especially in Japan, as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Smuggling Issues</p>
<p>(Arita) I feel that there must be a reason for the smuggling incidents in China. I have heard that smuggling is rampant not only in North China, but also in South China. What does the British government think about this?</p>
<p>(Ross) This is the situation in Guangdong, but I understand that certain import tax rates of the Guangdong Customs are agreed upon with the Nanjing government. (Ninth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita visited Prime Minister Hirota at his official residence at 9:30 AM on the 9th for important discussions, and then attended a cabinet meeting. The discussions were considered important as a meeting with Frederick Leith-Ross was scheduled for the afternoon of the same day to discuss Sino-British-Japanese relations, hence the advance consultation with Prime Minister Hirota to prepare for the conversation with Ross. (Ninth, Domei)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Baba is scheduled to meet with Frederick Leith-Ross, the British envoy to China for economic affairs, at the Finance Minister's official residence at 4:00 PM on the 10th. He will listen to Ross's views on China and on the economic and political situation in East Asia. The Finance Minister will also explain his views. There will be important discussions between them. (Ninth, Domei)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Isoya Explains Position on Economic Aid to China <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Stating That Japan's and Britain's Circumstances Differ, Political Influence Must Be Considered</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Frederick Leith-Ross met with Isoya, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, at the British Ambassador's official residence from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM on the 8th for one and a half hours. Ross first stated to Isoya that after spending nine months in China, he had gained a considerable understanding of the actual state of Chinese politics and economics, and that Chinese finances were not without flaws. He added that financial aid to China would benefit China itself and peace in the Far East, and asked Isoya to fully explain the opinions of the Japanese military regarding Japan's attitude towards aid to China in his report to his home country. Isoya, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, replied that speaking in a personal capacity, Japan sincerely hopes to assist China in revitalizing its economy, and its enthusiasm is no less than that of Britain. However, the situation within China is extremely complicated, and China and Japan have close geographical ties, so even if it is financial aid, the result will immediately generate political consequences. Therefore, it is impossible for Japan to consider financial aid without political influence. Japan's circumstances differ from those of Britain, and it cannot adopt a national policy with the sole aim of economic action. He hoped that the British authorities would understand this point and recognize Japan's position, and then exchange opinions with the Japanese diplomatic and financial authorities, so that they would be able to recognize the differences in each other's positions. It seems that Ross understood Japan's position on China at this meeting. He is scheduled to meet with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the financial authorities in the next few days to negotiate aid to China and adjust the issue of smuggling in North China. (Eighth, Domei)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Frederick Leith-Ross has met with Isoya, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, and financial magnates in recent days. The impression gained by the Japanese government is that Mr. Li has not yet fully and properly understood the situation, so there is still a considerable gap in understanding between the parties. Mr. Li believes that providing financial assistance to China, if it stabilizes the financial sector, will not only benefit Britain, but also benefit Japan, as the Chinese issue is being dealt with solely from an economic point of view, and that this is enough to solve the problem. However, the Japanese government observes the special relationship between China and Japan in East Asia and believes that the doctrine of China's reliance on Europe and the United States needs to be cleared up. It is reported that the observation is as follows:</p>
<p>If China establishes a loan from Britain and reforms the currency system, and Britain takes control of Chinese banks and customs, then all policies can come from this. China's reliance on Europe and the United States will endanger Japan's politically inseparable relationship with China. Even if Britain provides financial aid to China and proposes a joint loan, Japan will not be able to agree unless China expresses its willingness to cooperate with Japan politically. The Japanese government's point of view is that Britain's approach to China is to use the Anglo-Japanese joint loan and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway as the basis for expanding the railway network in order to promote commerce, maintain acquired rights and interests, and expand its hopes, while waiting for the opportunity to come. However, since China is not aware of the current situation in East Asia, the result of joint financial assistance will only benefit Britain economically, while Japan will only act as a watch dog. There is concern about this situation.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's views above are very firm. The issue of joint financial assistance to China should be considered from a political perspective first. As far as Britain itself is concerned, it is only a secondary issue. As for China, it wants to seek coordination between Britain and Japan, but it has not expressed any intention to coordinate with Japan on economic issues in Australia, Egypt, trade negotiations, and other colonies and territories. It can be seen that the British side still does not have sufficient understanding of Japan's position in East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese government will decide its fundamental attitude on all future occasions as follows:</p>
<p>Japan's interests in China are very different from those of Britain. It must be understood that this is a matter of life and death for Japan. It is necessary to know that coordination is impossible if Japan's special position in East Asia is not fully understood, and that the outcome will ultimately be impossible.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned claim is to do its utmost to correct Frederick Leith-Ross's understanding of Japan, and to establish a British policy towards China under this new understanding. It seems that the Japanese side has reached a consensus on this issue. (Ninth, Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>Ross Said That the Economic Stability of China is in the Interest of Both Britain and Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Economic Federation held a welcome dinner for Frederick Leith-Ross at 6:00 PM on the 8th. After free discussions on issues such as China's currency system reform, Britain's loan to China, and China's economic recovery, a grand dinner was held. At the dinner, Mr. Kuranari Manso said in his speech, "Although we Japanese feel that we have a vested interest in China's economic reflection and political stability, there are differences between Britain and Japan in their China policy. From our point of view, Britain's vested interest lies in China's economy, commerce, and finance. On the contrary, Japan's vested interest lies in China's reorganization, which is indispensable for Japan's well-being and the existence of its people. The difference between the policies of Britain and Japan stems from this. However, what is fundamentally beneficial to China is also beneficial to Britain and Japan. This is clear, so we hope that Britain and Japan will cooperate to restore China's economy."</p>
<p>Next, Frederick Leith-Ross rose to reply, "My mission is solely to seek China's economic stability. I believe this will also be in Japan's interest. When China is stable in the future, you will understand that my mission is for the future development of China. I hope to cooperate with Japan in this endeavor." (Ninth, Domei)</p>

<p>Plans in Egypt and South Africa</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Pirow, the Minister of Defense of the Union of South Africa, has recently arrived here. The general public attaches great importance to Pirow's arrival, as he is known as the "defense dictator" in South Africa. He recently submitted a plan to reorganize national defense to the Federal Parliament and explained to the parliament that the situation in the Mediterranean has changed greatly. Italy, with its submarines, light warships, and air force, is sufficient to cut off traffic between Britain and India. Therefore, South Africa is about to become a key point in the new route between Britain and India. As a result, it is necessary to strengthen South Africa's national defense. Regarding this, it is reported that the policy adopted by Britain is to open up two routes: one is an air route, departing from Britain, passing through Iraq, and reaching India; the other is a sea route, which should bypass the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and reach India. Pirow's mission is related to the second point. When he talks with the British authorities, he will pay special attention to the following: building strong air and naval bases in Cape Town and along the coast of South Africa. (Eighth, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Miles Lampson, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, has returned home to report on his work for several days. He recently visited the chiefs of the War Office and the General Staff for discussions. It is said that the main purpose of their discussions was to discuss the distribution of British troops stationed in Egypt. According to the Egyptian representatives, they had requested in the Anglo-Egyptian Conference that Britain must withdraw the British troops stationed in Cairo to the Suez Canal area. On the British side, it was believed that the climate in the Suez Canal area was harsh and not suitable for stationing troops, and that the troops would be concentrated in one place, and a large number of reserves would have to be stationed behind them. Otherwise, it would be in a dangerous isolated position, so they expressed their opposition to Egypt's wishes. After Sir Miles Lampson's negotiations, it is reported that the British government may agree to reduce the area where British troops are stationed as much as possible, but it must be exchanged for the condition that the strategically important position is not in danger. (Eighth, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Menzies, the Federal Attorney-General of Australia, recently gave a speech at the Imperial Association, saying, "The Australian Federation should maintain the most friendly relations with all countries along the Pacific coast. Although its policy of relations is sufficient to make Japanese exports lose the market and promote the sales of British goods, the Australian government's preferential treatment to Britain does not mean that it is hostile to Japan. This is something that Japan should understand." (Ninth, Havas)</p>

The visit to the United States by the Japanese training squadron is the first since the Manchurian Incident. At this time when the arms reduction conference has broken down, its actions have great political significance. Commander Yoshida plans to visit the presidents of the United States, Panama, and Mexico to explain the reasons why Japan is a stabilizing force in East Asia. (Ninth, Domei)</p>

<p>Strict Suppression of Illegal Drug Trafficking, Our Representative Believes It Is Worth Discussing</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Conference on the Punishment of Illegal Trafficking in Narcotics continued its meeting this afternoon. The US representative proposed a motion stating that the purpose of the conference is to limit the use of drugs, and that this should be clearly declared for use solely for medicinal and scientific purposes. The conference should issue a broad declaration condemning the act of trafficking in drugs, and the laws of each country should determine what kind of trafficking is illegal. The Portuguese representative said that this conference was convened based on the 1925 Geneva Convention, and this convention only applies to opium, so it believes that there is no right to discuss the US proposal. Spain, Austria, Britain, and the Netherlands agreed with Portugal's statement, while Brazil, China, and Czechoslovakia advocated that the conference should discuss the US proposal. The meeting adjourned and was scheduled to continue tomorrow. (Eighth, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The conference on the drafting of the "International Convention on the Punishment of Illegal Trafficking in Narcotics" continued its meeting this morning. The US representative immediately proposed an amendment, advocating that the governments of all countries must clearly declare their position or promulgate laws regarding the cultivation and illegal trafficking of opium, and admit that the production and trafficking of opium are legal and bear responsibility, or severely, directly, and publicly punish illegal trafficking. As a result, the representatives of China and the United States proposed to include a permissive clause in the draft convention, using the amendment proposed by the United States as a blueprint, stipulating that governments of all countries that wish to suppress the production and illegal trafficking of opium should act in accordance with this clause.

The report attributes this to the gradual increase in Chinese technicians who are capable of handling many jobs. The report also elaborates on the comfort of life in Shanghai, but states that there is currently no need to hire Americans. Except for American stores in China that hire Americans, European companies mostly hire their own nationals as employees, and other foreign nationals are willing to hire Chinese to fill the vacancies. Trained Chinese technicians will eventually take the place of foreigners. The Chinese are now also gradually encroaching on the professional world. (Eighth, National Telegram)</p>

<p>The Lifeline of China's Finances at Stake - Hope Japan Reins in Its Behavior</p>
<p>(London) The Times today published an editorial detailing the massive smuggling situation in North China, stating frankly that China is unable to stop those who rely on force to smuggle, resulting in significant losses in customs revenue. The lifeline of China's finances is tied to customs revenue, so this matter has extremely serious implications. Japan originally promised to respect the integrity of China's territory, but now it is engaging in indirect aggression. The political implications of this action are very clear. Even if officials lower tax rates, the unfair advantage that Japanese goods currently enjoy over British goods will inevitably continue to exist. The only hope at present lies in the Japanese government changing its methods. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Yurenev, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan who took office in March of the eighth year of the Showa era, has requested a three-month leave of absence in accordance with instructions from his home government and is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for Moscow on the 25th of this month. Ambassador Yurenev is also scheduled to visit Prime Minister Hirota on the 10th regarding the most deeply related aspects of the Japan-Soviet treaty. On that day, in addition to the Fisheries Treaty, a comprehensive adjustment of Japan-Soviet relations will also be exchanged in principle, so the meeting is of great importance. The reason for Ambassador Yu's return to the country at this time is that there is no prospect of rapid progress in the Fisheries Negotiations and the handling of border disputes. The rapprochement between Britain and Japan in East Asia is a notable trend, and it is impossible to predict what will happen. Therefore, the ambassador is being recalled to discuss Japan policy and East Asia policy with senior Soviet government officials. This action at this time is particularly noteworthy. (9th Domei)</p>

<p>Cleveland - Hundreds of Republican representatives from 48 states are holding a convention here today to nominate the party's presidential candidate. There are four people with hope of being selected: Kansas Governor Landon, Senator Borah, Senator Vandenberg, and Chicago News publisher Colonel Knox. Although Landon is the most hopeful, it is not certain that he will win. Borah indicated today that if Landon is elected, he will leave the party and support President Roosevelt. It is also said that some influential Republicans are now discussing foreign policy, which reduces isolation compared to the past policies. (9th Reuters)</p>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio - Representatives from all 48 states of the Republic Party are scheduled to hold a convention here today. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have previously announced an adjournment until the 15th of this month, so that all members of the party can attend and participate, and nominate candidates for the general election. It is generally expected that Kansas Governor Landon will be selected, because other candidates, such as Senators Vandenberg, Dickinson, Borah and Colonel Knox, have failed to unite to resist him. As for the vice-presidential candidate, Vandenberg and Mrs. Roosevelt, daughter of the late President Roosevelt, are most popular. The two items, a balanced budget, and the federal government should not interfere in state administration and the rights originally enjoyed by the state government should be restored, will be major campaign pointes. Former Republican President Hoover is scheduled to deliver a speech via radio here tomorrow evening to explain the party's political platform. At the same time, President Roosevelt will deliver a speech via radio in Little Rock, Arkansas, to explain the Democratic Party's political platform. The president is scheduled to depart from Washington at midnight today to go to Arkansas, Indiana, and Texas to deliver campaign speeches. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>Cleveland - Senator Borah, who is expected to be nominated as a presidential candidate, visited Landon, another candidate for president, today to discuss the attitude that the national convention should take on the gold standard, industry and commerce, and foreign affairs. However, Borah denied that he was the main force opposing Landon. Vandenberg clearly opposes Landon. Borah has absolutely no misgivings about the party platform proposed by those who support Landon. Borah believes that the most important thing to do at the National Convention is to draft the party platform. I feel that the various drafts submitted at this meeting can quite represent the views of various forces in this meeting. There are many hesitations and concerns about diplomatic events. In fact, in view of the current situation in Europe, we must have a way to deal with it. In short, the United States must adhere to the principle of absolute neutrality in all international disputes without hesitation. As for the draft on monopoly, Borah believes that its wording is no different from that of 40 years ago and cannot win the trust of voters. It is extremely cowardly to reach a compromise on this issue. Mentioning the party's monetary policy, Borah said, "The powerful people in the party are now advocating a strict gold standard, which is a monopoly of currency. The problem is very serious. We would very much like to hear Landon express his views on this." (8th National News)</p>
<p>Cleveland - The forces opposing Landon are now showing signs of disintegration. A veteran Republican said that although we know nothing about Landon as a person, we will vote for him. Landon can get half of the votes in the 90 delegates from New York State, and San Xue Wenyis is the key to whether he can be elected. However, judging from the current situation, San Xue Wenyis may tend to Landon in the second vote. (8th National News)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt will travel to the southwest tonight to deliver campaign speeches. He will probably not directly attack the Republican National Convention now opening in Cleveland. It is said that the nature of his speech will mostly be non-political. However, this trip is actually the beginning of the active operation of the election campaign. The president has scheduled to speak in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Wednesday, and attend the Texas Centennial Congress in Houston on Friday.

<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Ashehurst proposed to amend the constitution in the Senate today, so that various government facilities judged by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional become legal. The proposal stated that "Congress should have the power to formulate laws and regulate agriculture, commerce, and industry," and proposed that a constitutional amendment should be approved by three-quarters of the state legislatures within seven years to take effect. It is generally believed that this proposal is very noteworthy because it was proposed by a Democratic Senator. In the Republican National Convention, there was also a proposal to amend the constitution, but it advocated expanding the power of the states, which is just the opposite. Ashehurst is an orthodox member of the Democratic Party, so political observers today generally believe that 大 or canceling the power of the federal government to regulate agricultural organizations and economic affairs will become the main point of contention in this presidential election. In the past, the Republican Party advocated centralization of power, and the Democratic Party advocated decentralization of power. This time, it is the opposite of the past situation.

British 主 representative Ashurst stood up and spoke, saying that it is necessary to conclude an international treaty. The country's labor representative Shaw and 示 opposed it. Then, the Indian 主 representative, Sir Hada, spoke, explaining the special circumstances of the Indian textile industry and the reasons why the employers resolutely opposed the 40-hour work week, saying that the Indian climate and political and religious facilities are different from other countries, and it is inconvenient to implement the 40-hour work week. Moreover, the Japanese textile industry has become a strong enemy due to the low exchange rate of the Japanese gold, which is even more convenient to increase the burden on the Indian textile industry.

As for the cancellation of sanctions against Italy, it is a fact that the United Kingdom and France have not made any decisions at this time.

<p>(Paris) Although the sit-down strike movement has been resolved through the mediation of the new Prime Minister Blum, several districts in the capital still resemble a British Sunday because the employees of department stores have not yet resumed work.

Last night, employees of seven insurance companies occupied the company's offices. Shortly thereafter, 1,500 workers in Dunkirk announced a strike.

<p>A Shanhaiguan correspondent of the Mainland Daily News reported on the 4th that smuggling from Shanhaiguan by land to Qinhuangdao has been sporadic for the past six weeks. A few days ago, it suddenly stopped completely and switched to sea routes. However, the relics of smuggling will remain here for a long time and cannot be destroyed without earthquakes or other disasters. The Japanese authorities in Shanhaiguan used the surplus profits from smuggling to build a magnificent three-story elementary school to teach the children of Japanese residents in Shanhaiguan. Its address is adjacent to the Chinese customs. Apart from the buildings of the "Manchukuo" customs and post office, its architecture can be called the most magnificent here. If there is an ancestral master of smuggling in the world, then this building can be named "Ancestral Temple of Smuggling." In addition to serving as a school for Japanese children, the building also serves as a meeting place for Japanese residents. These people gather in it from time to time to discuss. Inquiring with customs personnel and others, I carefully inquired about the origin of the establishment of the building. It is said that when silver smuggling was at its peak in the summer of 1935, the customs anti-smuggling team encountered various difficulties. More than 400,000 silver dollars were smuggled through Shanhaiguan every day. Each train was full of Koreans smuggling silver when it arrived from Tianjin. After the customs seized it, it was confiscated. However, very few were found. Most of them crossed the Great Wall and entered the territory of "Manchukuo." The customs repeatedly asked the Japanese police and the Japanese military authorities to assist in the arrest, but the effectiveness was minimal. Before long, the customs anti-smuggling team was forced to be unable to patrol on the Great Wall. The smugglers mostly threw the silver into "Manchukuo" from the top of the Great Wall. Two smugglers, one Manchu and one Japanese, fell to the ground from the city and died. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities prevented the customs anti-smuggling team from patrolling on the city. As a result, the smugglers became more unscrupulous, and the number seized by the customs decreased day by day. Not long after, the police of the Japanese consulate suddenly began to search for silver smuggled by Koreans. The customs authorities were surprised, and the elementary school building began to be built at this time. Later, it was learned that the construction cost was all derived from the surplus profits of silver. The Japanese police exchanged the silver dollars seized from the Koreans for paper money, but did not send it to the Chinese customs. The exchange shops in the pseudo-Manchu territory outside the Great Wall, which were often taken care of by smugglers, sold the silver dollars at market prices. The remaining profits were accumulated to pay for the construction of the elementary school. Then the Japanese police suddenly stopped searching for silver, because the elementary school building had been completed.</p>

Currently, the Japanese side is using the strategy of controlling Inner Mongolia, encircling Outer Mongolia, and attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is actively responding to the war and views the Japanese side as even more aggressive. Both sides send many spies to probe military actions, and they are active everywhere. According to a report from a Japanese spy to the military, the Soviet Union is mobilizing military trains on the Siberian Railway extremely frequently, so that international express trains must give way. For example, an international train once stopped at Oyahee Station for as long as fourteen hours, allowing twenty-eight Soviet military trains to pass before the international train could depart. Also, in the station premises of Novosibirsk, there were three trains fully loaded with 150 military trucks each, and two trains fully loaded with 200 military trucks each. At Daria Station, there were three trains carrying tanks, one of which had twenty large tanks, and the other two had thirty small tanks each. Regarding the Soviet Union's expansion of its Far East military preparations, the Japanese side, based on this information, launched a large-scale attack and propaganda, believing that the Soviet Union was disrupting peace in the Far East. However, the Japanese themselves do not practice what they preach. I don't know how they can justify themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Hebei-Chahar Diplomacy Tends to Stagnation: People's Hearts Gradually Stabilizing; Itagaki Will Enter Customs Soon <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Hebei-Chahar situation, during the last ten days of last month, due to the large-scale increase in troops by the Japanese side, caused rumors to spread, and there was a sense of panic. In the past week, the rumors have gradually subsided, and people's hearts have gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Diplomatically, it has completely stagnated. The reason for this is that the two sides have different views. For example, in past negotiations, the Hebei-Chahar authorities regarded the cancellation of the Hebei Eastern Pseudo-Organization and the return of the Chahar Northern regime as prerequisites, while the Japanese side hoped that the Hebei-Chahar authorities would follow in the footsteps of Hebei Eastern. Since the opinions of both sides are completely opposite, negotiations cannot proceed.</p>
<p>The generals here are doing their best to maintain the local area, so they are cautious in dealing with matters, hoping to achieve a unified country.</p>
<p>All the work of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee is proceeding as usual, but there is no special progress. In order to maintain the security of Beijing and prevent unscrupulous people from taking the opportunity to make trouble, the authorities send troops to guard the city walls every night and patrol. During the day, the various troops are actively training.</p>
<p>Under this situation, the other party is also studying everything. Itagaki Seishiro, the chief of staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, will enter the customs soon to discuss with the commander of the Japanese garrison army, Tashiro Kanichirō. Generally speaking, after their meeting, the relationship of the situation will be more important. Yin Rugeng secretly went to Tianjin last week to visit Tashiro. Two or three days ago, he had transferred to Shanhaiguan to await Itagaki, hoping that the Hebei Eastern Pseudo-Organization could survive. (7th)</p>

<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of Gansu Province, in order to thoroughly eliminate opium poppies in Gaolan and other thirteen counties, which have already been banned in the first phase of opium prohibition, and in Dingxi and other nineteen counties, which are banned in the second phase, in order to thoroughly eliminate them in accordance with the decree, has appointed special commissioners to go to the counties to prohibit them, so as to eradicate the roots. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. However, as for the opium poppy seeds in the various counties, in addition to the seeds in the counties that have already been banned in the first phase, which have already been destroyed, although the various counties that are banned in the second phase are being investigated, it is feared that the people do not understand the great righteousness and still secretly store the seeds, hoping to secretly plant them. They should all be destroyed in order to fundamentally eliminate them. An order has now been issued to the various counties that are banning opium planting in the second phase and to the prohibition commissioners to supervise and destroy all the opium poppy seeds in the counties and report the compliance situation for inspection.</p>

<p>Shantou Communication: This spring, the climate in Chaozhou and Meizhou was out of order, and there is no hope of a bumper harvest of early rice. In addition, rumors are rampant, legal tender is falling in price, and foreign rice is soaring, with a price of 13 yuan per 100 catties. Leading people in Xingning County, therefore, set out to rob food. In Yangziling, Shima, Fengshu, Huangjingtang, Yanggangtou, Yandun, Gantang, Liantangli, and other places in Longtian District, there are cries of distress everywhere. Hunger-stricken people set out in teams every day, each team of more than 200 people, dressed in rags, emaciated, and looking like they are starving, going to homes that are slightly better off to make a fuss about the famine. They bring men, women, and children, crying miserably. Their whereabouts are uncertain every day. If they encounter a long journey, they will camp in the wilderness. Currently, the poor people of all ethnic groups in the county have no way to survive and are rioting everywhere to prolong their lives. They have convened the elders of each ethnic group to discuss relief in order to appease the poor. For example, the Zhang Ethnic Self-Government Association, after preparations were completed, planned to provide relief. First, investigation forms were issued to investigate the names, genders, ages, village names, and house names of the heads of households to be relieved. After the investigation is completed, relief will be provided according to the list. The Chen ethnic elders of Dongshan Temple in Nipi District also planned to raise funds from various ancestral temples and wealthy people to provide relief for one month. The Pan ethnic elders of Dachiwu in Yonghe District specially persuaded the wealthy fathers to donate, raising more than 1,000 yuan and dozens of stones of white rice, planning to provide relief during the day. The headquarters of the Third Army Seventh Division stationed there also allocated 1,000 yuan to the relief association to provide relief to the hungry people. In order to provide relief to the hungry people by providing work, the headquarters issued a notice recruiting 600 workers to repair the collapsed river embankments. After the completion, it was changed to a provincial highway protection team, with a monthly salary of 15 yuan (including food), which was issued by the division. Now that the poor people have heard the news, they are flocking to the department to be hired. (4th)</p>

Feng Gengbai, the section chief of the Fourth Section of the county government, and He Runzhang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, attended. The township chiefs of the district, led by Ding Shilong, the chief of Piyun Town, worked hard to handle the self-renewal registration, and were ordered to commend them. However, on the one hand, they aroused the resentment of opium addicts, and then suffered the slander of villains, and presented a complaint to the provincial authorities. [Illegible] The county magistrate received training and went to Beijing, and approved "Inquire and verify." The section chief in charge, without the consent of the acting county magistrate Secretary Shen, [illegible] conducted a trial by a forwarding trial officer, interrogated and sent him to jail. The township chiefs felt that there was no guarantee in handling opium prohibition, and they resigned collectively on the spot. Then Director He earnestly explained, and Section Chief Feng realized his mistake and publicly admitted his fault. After District Chief Shen comforted them, they cancelled their resignations.</p>

<p>In Xietang, Suzhou, there have been waves of rent resistance since last year. At noon on the 8th, 400 to 500 villagers from Xialian Village in the area went to Yuxiang nearby and completely destroyed the houses of seven families, including Baolong Li Jinliang, Li Jiaquan, Zhang Defu, Zhang Hongqi, Zhang Shaoxiang, Zhang Muxiang, and Zhang Rongru. The Security Team stationed in Xietang rushed to the scene after hearing the news. The villagers who caused the trouble had already dispersed, leaving only three people, including the old woman Li Shenshi. The team was taken away, and that night, they were bailed out by the Baozhang and others. However, at about 5 pm, a village child, 5 years old, drowned in the river two miles away from Yuxiang. The villagers of Xialian falsely accused the child of being drowned by the Security Team. At about 6 am on the 9th, more than 300 people gathered again and went to the Xietang Town Security Branch to negotiate, and clashed with the guards of the Security Team, and grabbed firearms. The guards were outnumbered and were rushed into the second gate. The Security Team had no choice but to fire thirty or forty shots into the air, and the villagers temporarily retreated.

<h3 id="e88">Wuxi: A Collection of Information Regarding the Silk Cocoon Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the weighing scales at the silk cocoon merchants in Xiyi, yesterday marked the fourth day. Here is a record of various pieces of information:</p>
<p>Previously, the County Agricultural Association, due to the Silk Cocoon Guild setting the cocoon prices too low, had submitted a request to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to jointly consult with Zeng Jikuan, the director of the Jiangsu Sericulture Management Improvement Committee, inviting leaders of the silk cocoon industry to negotiate and agree to raise the cocoon price. The opening price was set at 32 yuan as the standard. Recently, they received an approval order from the Ministry of Industry, and have already sent a letter to the National Economic Committee's Sericulture Improvement Association to investigate and handle the matter accordingly. In addition, the Jiangsu Construction Department has also sent a telegram instructing the Sericulture Model District to investigate the recent silk prices and silkworm rearing costs, and to negotiate with the Silk Cocoon Guild to handle the matter properly.</p>
<p>The County Magistrate of Long County, considering the current cocoon market and the importance of maintaining security, has implemented very thorough preventative measures. However, on the first day of the opening of the scales, a robbery occurred at the Yuanju Silk Cocoon Merchant, with stolen cocoons amounting to over 6,000 yuan. Recognizing the significant relationship between this incident and the cocoon market, the County Magistrate has specifically convened all county public security, land and water police officers for an important meeting this morning to ensure strict prevention.</p>
<p>The rural silk cocoon merchants are experiencing a surge in shipments, and the quality of the cocoons is good. The highest cocoon price is 38 yuan, with the reeling price at 34 yuan.</p>
<p>According to reports from neighboring counties by the Silk Cocoon Guild, the highest price in Jiangyin is 45 yuan, with the reeling price at 41 yuan, and shipments are still strong. Liyang has a large volume of shipments, and the quality of the cocoons is good, with a reeling price of 29 yuan. Wujin has cocoons of excellent quality, with a high estimated price of 36 yuan and a reeling price of 32 yuan.</p>
<p>With the arrival of new cocoons on the market, various silk mills are also successively starting their machinery. As of yesterday, 37 mills have already started, and several others, including the Luoshe Weixin Mill, are also preparing to start their machinery.</p>
<p>The Sericulture Model District, with the spring cocoons already on the market and the autumn silkworm egg ordering about to begin, and considering that the required quantities by silkworm farmers and merchants in various regions often result in surpluses or shortages, has specifically established a method: those requiring silkworm eggs should first place orders with the egg production farms in their respective districts by July 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Tan Jiujin's Arrest and Transfer to Wuxi <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Xu Dafu and others, residents of Shazhou Town, the seventh district of Changshu, obstructed river construction. The County Security Team dispatched personnel to the villages and arrested 14 people, including Xu Dafu and Ding Shishu, and transferred them to the Wuxi District Security Command for interrogation. Subsequently, the Provincial Government investigated and determined that the case fell under the scope of ordinary criminal matters and did not require military law processing. It ordered the Changshu County Government to send police officers to Wuxi to present a report to District Commander Zang Qifang, who then transferred Xu Dafu and the other 13 individuals back to Changshu. The main culprit in the case, Tan Jiujin, remained at large. Commissioner Zang ordered all counties to investigate and apprehend him. Yesterday, Dai Shouquan, a detective from the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, arrested Tan in Changshu and escorted him to Wuxi for transfer to the Commissioner's Office for interrogation. Furthermore, based on a confidential report, the Commissioner's Office learned that Hu Derong and Qin Yunsheng, residents of the Jiaochang area in Changshu, were selling illicit opium. The Commissioner secretly ordered the Changshu County Government to arrest Hu and Qin and to confiscate half a catty of opium, all of which were to be transferred to the Commissioner's Office in Wuxi for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Striving for Exemption from Stamp Duty <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce, because the Ministry of Finance required that receipts for membership fees collected by various trade associations be subject to stamp duty according to the rate schedule in Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, Section 2, for receipts of money, goods, and materials, decided at a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to strongly advocate for exemption.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a reply, stating: "Upon investigation, this matter was also reported to the Ministry by the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce via telegram. The item of 'receipts of money' requires that, with the exception of those issued by government agencies, all individuals or organizations, regardless of whether they are individuals or groups, should pay stamp duty according to the law, and there is no provision for exemption for those not containing business characteristics. Trade associations are not government agencies, so their receipts for collecting membership fees cannot be an exception. As for the item of account books, according to the Stamp Tax Law, it is limited to those used for business purposes. Individuals and educational, cultural, and charitable organizations do not have business characteristics, so their account books should be exempt from stamp duty. However, receipts for money should still be stamped as required. The original report's claims are also a misunderstanding. The request to exempt receipts for membership fees collected by public associations from stamp duty should not be considered." Yesterday, the Federation of Commerce sent letters to the chambers of commerce in various counties for their information.</p>

Unexpectedly, the Wang family's had already closed down and could not afford to pay. Tong then instructed veteran inmates to inflict various kinds of abusive practices and beatings on Wang. When the county magistrate went to the prison to promote anti-opium awareness, Wang informed him of this matter. The county magistrate severely reprimanded the warden and others. However, after the county magistrate left, Tong became even more enraged and ordered the beatings to continue, using large iron chains to add to the punishment. Wang's wife, Weng, learned of this and specifically filed a complaint with the county government, requesting a thorough investigation to redress the injustice.</p>

On his way back, as it was getting dark, he took a detour to his married daughter's home. After dinner, the daughter saw the money he was carrying and immediately asked her father for a loan. The old man refused. Late at night, the daughter, driven by greed, took advantage of her father's deep sleep and used a knife to kill him. She hid the body under the bed. The next day, the old man's wife and son noticed that he had not arrived at their home. Later, they accidentally discovered the body under the bed, and the crime was exposed.

<p>This county has been quite serious about handling anti-opium matters this time. The entire town is divided into seven districts. Although the district chiefs have worked hard on matters such as the self-registration of opium users, the investigation and crackdown on opium users, and the general reporting of opium offenders, their results have been ordinary. However, the first district chief, Chen Weifen, and the seventh district chief, Zhu Qishou, have been extremely diligent in their work and have been commended by the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. County Magistrate Qi Yunlong has also worked extremely hard on anti-opium matters, and the Provincial Department has not only compiled the case for handling but also issued a strict warning to Xia Yuanzheng, the director of the county's drug rehabilitation center, for incomplete facilities and lack of results, in order to show punishment.</p>

<p>Since the Yaochang light tax salt price was agreed upon by both parties and the Transportation Office instructed the left field director to comply, each kiln could have collected salt and paid funds earlier. Unexpectedly, all the boatmen and a small number of kiln merchants believed that the new system, once implemented, would be quite detrimental, so they were passive and refused to comply, attempting to overturn the new system. Although the salt merchants petitioned several times, it was not implemented. The salt merchants believed that there was no prospect of collecting salt and that their livelihoods were in jeopardy. Yesterday, they united the salt merchants from the seven districts and held a meeting in Andong, deciding to send Wang Xizheng and four others to the province to petition the Transportation Office, demanding that salt be collected and funds be paid as soon as possible to alleviate the people's hardship.</p>

<p>At approximately 2 PM on the 6th, in Shanlian Town, the fourth district of Wuxing County, over seventy lake bandits from the Chaohu and Haizhou gangs suddenly arrived, divided among three Wushan boats, each carrying guns and weapons. They landed on the shore and first went to the town's security team, shooting down the door guards, and swarmed inside.

<p>The Shaoxing County Government's recompilation of shop and residence tax has encountered many obstacles and difficulties. The people have repeatedly appealed. Yesterday, the County Chamber of Commerce, the Yue Society Lawyers Association, and other groups jointly submitted a report to the county, stating the local situation and requesting that the compilation and valuation be divided into two steps. First, focus on compiling omissions and concealed properties without setting high targets. After the people have recovered slightly, continue to discuss appropriate measures. County Magistrate He replied that the purpose of this compilation of shop and residence tax is to find out omissions and concealed properties, and to correct deviations, just as the public notice said, the tax amount compilation will be transferred according to the current situation, not to increase it as a fixed principle, and that in today's situation of people's poverty and commercial difficulty, we must urgently seek improvement. The estimated problem of how to weigh the times, once the matter is completed, will be to call together all the gentlemen and associations to the meeting to make a final decision.</p>

<p>Rural Life in Jiujiang (Part 2) Jiang Aiqun</p>
<p>Farmers' Sideline Occupations</p>
<p>In terms of farmers' sideline occupations, women, besides a small number who work in places like the Jiuxing Yarn Factory and the Zhonghua Match Company in town, mostly stay at home, acting as virtuous wives and good mothers. Industrious and frugal farm families take pasting matchboxes as their only sideline occupation. For pasting 1,000 matchboxes, they only receive 400 cash. Often, the entire family, old and young, is kept busy, and they still have to pay for the labor of transporting the paste, twine, and delivering and picking up the matchboxes to earn anything. It seems like the match factory is too harsh. Actually, these local match factories are being encroached upon by the foreign match industry and are still struggling to survive in the face of adversity. So, it is probably more accurate to say that this is one piece of evidence of the deep penetration of imperialist forces into the countryside. Men cannot rely solely on farmland. As we saw in the previous section about the poverty of farmers cultivating farmland, we can imagine that their major income comes from carrying loads and carrying sedan chairs in Lushan. If we say that carrying loads and carrying sedan chairs is their main occupation, there is some justification for that. The price for carrying loads (from Jiujiang to Guling is 43 li) is 3 strings of cash per 100 jin. Valuable items that need to be carefully protected can be increased to 1 or 2 strings of cash. Farmers who carry sedan chairs are half from Jiujiang and half from Huangmei. The price for carrying sedan chairs (from Lianhua Cave at the foot of Lushan to Guling, a mountain road of 18 li) is 4 yuan in legal tender per sedan chair, with each of the four carriers getting one yuan. Because the sedan chairs belong to the China Travel Service, each person has to pay a rent of 2 jiao. They often carry foreigners, so they can say a few English words, such as "dollars", "yes", and "number one," etc. A few years ago, there were 4,000 to 5,000 people engaged in these two sideline occupations. In recent years, there are only 2,000 to 3,000. Business is busiest from May to September each year. If business is good, each person can earn a net profit of 100 yuan per year. If business is not good, they can still earn a net profit of 50 to 60 yuan, which is also a considerable help to their household expenses. However, when they are working, under the scorching sun, going up and down the mountain, those who take summer vacation in Lushan should imagine how much hardship and danger there is! Midway up the mountain, there is a place called "Hero's Slope". The mountain is steep and difficult to climb. It is said that one who passes this slope is a hero. If we give this beautiful name to these farmers, they truly deserve it without shame! In addition, selling firewood is also an important sideline occupation, but because of the limited space, I will not say more about it.</p>
<p>Farmers' Conscription and Corvee Labor</p>
<p>In recent years, in addition to the serious losses caused by severe floods and droughts, the most painful thing for farmers is the government's conscription and corvee labor. The situation of the people's corvee labor in each bao in the past three years is as follows: In January of the 23rd year, to build the Jiuxing Road (Jiujiang to Xingzi), over 100 laborers were conscripted. In June of the 24th year, over 30 laborers were additionally conscripted. In March of the 23rd year, to build the airport, over 300 laborers were conscripted. In October of the same year, to build the Jiurui Road (Jiujiang to Ruichang), over 400 laborers were conscripted. In March of the 24th year, over 100 laborers were again conscripted for repairs. In October of the 24th year, to build the Lianxi Road, over 200 laborers were conscripted (some added to the river dredging and river filling project to make over 1,000 laborers). In January of the 25th year, to build the Jiuhu Road (Jiujiang to Hukou), over 600 laborers were conscripted, as well as over 100 laborers conscripted for other repairs of bridges and transportation of timber miscellaneous work. In total, there are no less than 2,000 laborers conscripted (an average of 20 laborers per household). Some farm families hire people to be conscripted in their place, which must bear a very heavy labor wages. Those who cannot afford to hire people to be conscripted have to go into service themselves. Often, the whole family, old and young, rely on him to carry burdens to maintain their livelihoods. At this time, they have to put aside their own family's food and clothing problems and go to serve. Moreover, because the conscription site is far away, it usually takes 10 days or 8 days to return. Then, not only can they not earn money to maintain the family's livelihood, but they have to beg and plead with high-interest lenders to borrow some money to buy rice and salt and bring it to the conscription site for use through the door of heavy interest exploitation. Recently, it has been rumored that the province is subsidizing 100,000 yuan in labor costs for the construction of the Jiuxing, Jiuhu, and Jiurui roads, but after it arrives at the local government, they say that it is used for surveying and office work, or that it is reserved for bridge and water pipe needs, with various excuses to prevaricate the farmers. The farmers sacrificed their own work and paid for firewood and rice to be conscripted, which has already caused great losses. Should the surveying fees and bridge and water pipe fees also be borne by the farmers? In short, the people of Jiangxi have suffered years of devastation by the communists. As in the great drought years ago, the crops were almost completely barren, and the people have been emptied out. They urgently need to recuperate. The government must pay special attention to this.

<p>Fish Industry Group's Secret Inspection</p>
<p>The Fish Industry Anti-Smuggling Inspection Committee, after announcing its establishment previously, dispatched personnel to various districts yesterday for secret inspections to determine whether fish merchants were smuggling goods. The organizational regulations of the Inspection Committee are as follows: 1. This committee is organized by all members of the marine fish industry and is named the Shanghai Fish Industry Anti-Smuggling Inspection Committee. 2. The purpose of this committee is to assist the government in strictly organizing the fish industry, strengthening anti-smuggling efforts, and respecting national sovereignty. 3. All fishermen, fish merchants, aquaculture, refrigeration, customs declaration, transportation, and other related patriotic comrades may join this committee as members. 4. The committee shall have fifteen members, five standing members, one chairman, one secretary, and a number of staff members dedicated to anti-smuggling inspection work. 5. The expenses of this committee shall be borne by the members themselves. 6. Upon discovery of smuggling, this committee shall immediately report it to the Customs Bureau for disposal. 7. After verification of the reported smuggled goods, in addition to requesting rewards from the Customs Bureau, this committee shall also provide honorary rewards. 8. Reporters, whether from the fish industry or outside, shall not fabricate facts based on personal grudges to harm others. 9. If staff members are found to be colluding, concealing, accepting bribes, or releasing goods, they shall be reported to the relevant authorities and punished as principal offenders and accomplices. 10. For the convenience of inspection, this committee may establish branch offices, and the directors of the offices shall be elected separately. 11. These regulations shall be implemented upon approval by the committee and may be amended at any time if there are any imperfections. The committee also sent a telegram to the national fish industry, stating: "Since Japanese ruffians have taken advantage of the special forces in North China to engage in organized smuggling, it has become like a rushing river, flooding the entire country. Its harm not only causes a large loss of tax revenue for our Customs Bureau but also rapidly destroys our economic structure, which is a million times more serious than military aggression. Although the government has now strictly established anti-smuggling measures to curb this in the future, some unscrupulous people still do not hesitate to act as accomplices, exhausting their ability to exploit loopholes and find outlets for smuggled goods everywhere. Thinking of this, how can we not be filled with fear? As far as our fish industry is concerned, the fishery products of seven provinces are being arbitrarily invaded by them. Even the obtained fishery products are disguised as domestic products and sold in large quantities, depriving our fishermen of their livelihoods. This has been happening not just for a day or two, and in the future, it will inevitably become more and more serious, and they will also smuggle their own imported goods on a large scale. Our colleagues, aware of this, have united with the backbone members of the industry to establish the Shanghai Fish Industry Anti-Smuggling Inspection Committee and have issued a declaration to begin inspection work. We hope that the people of the whole country and all industry groups, mindful of the current crisis, will stand on the same front, assist the government, eliminate traitors, and act quickly to save ourselves, which is the task of the nation and the first sign of unity. We respectfully offer our humble sincerity and hope for your public consideration. (Dagong News Agency)"</p>
<p>Electrical Appliance Industry Petitions the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the petition to amend the regulations on punishing smuggling, in addition to punishing the principal offenders, also punish important related persons, and respectfully request your approval. Since the issue of smuggling arose, tax revenue has been lost, and all industries are in panic, affecting the national economy and people's livelihoods in a very serious way. Your Ministry is well aware of the seriousness of the situation, and that rigorous suppression is necessary to turn the tide. Therefore, you issued clear orders and established regulations to punish smuggling, and various industry associations have also gathered to discuss and automatically report smuggling, so the trend of smuggling has been slightly curbed. However, given our country's environment, there are still those who invoke special forces to continue smuggling. Therefore, fundamental prevention is still difficult to fully realize. It is suggested that the punishment regulations be supplemented, and in addition to punishing the principal offenders according to the law, other important related persons should also be punished according to the severity of their responsibility, so that the sale and purchase of smuggled goods is not easy to operate, and although the smugglers are unscrupulous, the connection relationships can create direct resistance, and since the related persons must bear the punishment, the smugglers have to share their profits to silence them, so indirectly the smugglers' profits can be reduced, and they will not be willing to do this illegal thing. If this can be done, the power to prevent smuggling can be increased invisibly, and the purpose of fundamentally clearing up the problem can be achieved sooner. This is what the members of this association hope for. We respectfully submit our shallow views to your Ministry for inspection and hope for your approval, and we await your orders with utmost anxiety. Respectfully presented to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance."</p>

<p>Major General Seiichi Kita, Army Attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, was originally scheduled to take the Shanghai-Pingjin train at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, but was delayed until last night due to an incident. He left Shanghai for Beijing on the 11:00 p.m. express train, accompanied by Adjutant Captain Kumakawa. This trip is Kita's second since taking office in China. According to Japanese sources, Kita's trip to Beijing is to pay his respects to President Chiang for the first time and to convey his regards. He will also meet with Foreign Minister Zhang and other authorities to discuss opening up the deadlock in North China and to inquire about various war rumors in the Southwest. He will stay in Beijing for three or four days and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Ministry of Railways has completed the entire Jiangnan Railway line, and the section from Sunjiabu to Quzhou will be built first to connect with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company, founded by Zhang Jingjiang and others, is the pioneer of private railway enterprises in China. The first plan was to build the Wuhu-Zhapu Railway from Wuhu, Anhui to Zhapu, Zhejiang. The section from Wuhu to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng was started first and was opened to traffic in the 23rd year. In the 24th year, the shareholders' meeting decided to change the construction plan from Nanjing, through Wuhu, Xuancheng, Huizhou, Quzhou, to Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, and to Zhao'an on the Guangdong border, and was renamed the Jingzhao Railway. It was submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval, with 30 years of operating rights. The first section to be built was a public network from Nanjing to Wuhu, which was opened to traffic last year and connected to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway this spring. Passenger and freight transportation is busy, making it a major trunk line of the Jiangnan Railway network. The company is currently planning to extend the line from Sunjiabu to Huizhou, but it must submit a proposal to the shareholders' meeting to raise additional funds before it can proceed. According to the person in charge of the company, the Ministry of Railways now considers the road to be important and urgently needs to complete the entire line. Therefore, it decided to recover it for state operation and build the section from Sunjiabu to Quzhou first to connect with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. The company has received an order from the Ministry and immediately sent it to General Manager Zhang Jingjiang for review and submission to the shareholders' meeting for a decision. Zhang originally proposed that the road be privately operated, mainly to assist the government's construction with the people's resources. Now that the government intends to take it over for state operation, it will comply with the order and cede it. However, the Jing-Wu section that has already been opened to traffic was originally invested by the company and has achieved good results, so it will still be privately operated. In the future, after the completion and opening of the Chu-Qu section, joint transportation will be carried out with the Ministry of Railways. Jingdian said that the road will be purchased by the Ministry and that all conditions have been largely agreed upon. The company denied this.</p>

<h3 id="e112">China Flying Club Training Class Holds Opening Ceremony on Schedule, and a Tea Party was Held Last Night. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the announcement of the enrollment of students in the first flying training class of the China Flying Club, preparations for the opening of the class are being actively carried out. The club held a tea party at the YMCA in the Banzian Bridge at 5:00 p.m. to connect the feelings of the students and discuss the progress. All members and the club's Secretary-General Yao Xijiu, Aircraft and Navigation Group Director Chen Buzhou, etc. attended. Yao introduced each student and then reported on the purpose and process of establishing the flying class, saying that the opening of the flying training class is to promote civil aviation, so that people have a considerable understanding, as the initial step in the development of civil aviation, and to reserve talents for the government. The course is roughly the same as the primary flying class of the aviation school. As for the process of establishment, after the government approved the articles of association in mid-August last year, it formulated the course, etc., and announced its establishment in October, and ordered aircraft, and at the same time carried out publicity in writing. The aircraft will be delivered this spring, and the class can be opened. As for the tuition fee of 600 yuan, it is based on the estimated fuel costs, instructor salaries, and miscellaneous expenses incurred by the students. Because the club has no subsidies from the government, it is entirely borne by the students. In the future, if there are achievements and the government has subsidies, the burden on the students can be reduced. Regarding the students' future, according to government orders, the examination in the future must be handled in accordance with the Flying Personnel Examination Regulations, and personnel will be sent to supervise the examination. The regulations are strict, but the qualifications can be in line with primary pilots. Please provide proof, or send them to aviation schools to continue their studies, or introduce them to work in civil aviation companies. Then, it was agreed that half of the tuition fee should be paid within this week, and the rest should be paid in installments, but a guarantor is required, and it must be paid off within three months after the start of school. The opening ceremony will be held at the Longhua Flying Port on the morning of the 18th. At that time, Aviation Association Director Wu, the mayor, etc. will be invited to attend and give instructions. The opening of flight training is scheduled for the 22nd.</p>

<p>More than 30 trade associations in this city, including the Qing Oil and Flower Cake Industry, Bamboo Industry, Sand and Gravel Industry, Fenjiu Industry, Kitchenware Industry, Flower and Tree Industry, Sesame Oil Industry, Machine-Made Noodles Industry, Fishing Boat Sand Transportation Industry, Parasol Industry, Garment Industry, Printing and Dyeing Industry, Flour Industry, Cotton Ginning Industry, Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry, Fresh Medicine Industry, Pollen Industry, Tin Printing and Can Manufacturing Industry, Silk and Satin Printing Industry, Canned Candy, Biscuit, and Bread Industry, Vegetables, Paint and Woodware Industry, etc., jointly petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting to change the articles of association, postpone the payment of overdue membership fees, and allow the election of representatives to attend the general meeting to facilitate commercial operations. The document states: "Regarding the request to remedy the rights of members, change the procedures of the articles of association, postpone the payment of overdue membership fees, and allow the election of representatives to attend the meeting, there are four reasons why the affiliated associations have overdue membership fees. 1. The source of income for the affiliated associations depends entirely on the membership fees received from each member. However, the method of requiring compulsory membership cannot be implemented, so the associations cannot control the members of the same industry, and the members who have joined use this as an excuse and are unwilling to pay membership fees. This is one of the reasons why the affiliated associations have overdue fees. 2. The industry regulations of each industry association are drafted with reference to the interests of each industry. Every time they are submitted for record, the important clauses are deleted by the superior, resulting in mediocre industry regulations. The members are unwilling to pay membership fees because they see that the industry regulations are equivalent to a mere formality. This is the second reason why the affiliated associations have overdue fees. 3. The members of each association are unable to approve the industry regulations that are being submitted, and those that have been approved cannot be implemented. It is especially difficult in the concession areas, resulting in the industry regulations not taking effect, and the members' business operations are not guaranteed, so they are unwilling to pay fees. This is the third reason why the affiliated associations have overdue fees. 4. Each industry is affected by the whirlpool of the sluggish market, and business is in a slump. For price reductions, dumping, etc., each association is unable to rectify them because of the non-membership relationship, resulting in the members who have joined using the excuse that non-members cannot be controlled and business operations cannot be guaranteed, so they are unwilling to pay fees. This is the fourth reason why the affiliated associations have overdue fees. In summary, the above four reasons have put the affiliated associations in a helpless financial situation. Therefore, we specially jointly petition for a change of procedures, request a postponement of fee payments, and allow the election of representatives, so that the above reasons can be submitted to the general meeting for discussion of effective measures, so that the public associations that are struggling to survive can reach a state of completion and avoid the concerns of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. This is really for the public convenience. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Handling Storage and Mortgage Loans. After the Anhui Provincial Government established the Agricultural Warehouse Management Office based on the resolutions of the Rural Economic Research Conference, it dispatched Secretary Hu Shiqi to Shanghai several times to contact the banking community in the city for storage and mortgage loans in order to realize the plan to revive the rural economy of Anhui Province. After many rounds of consultations, a basic decision has been made that the Bank of China, the China Farmers Bank, and the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate will jointly handle storage and mortgage loans, with a total amount of 4.4 million yuan. The Bank of China and the China Farmers Bank will each recognize 1.7 million yuan, and the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate will recognize 1 million yuan, totaling 4.4 million yuan. The interest rate is 8% per month. The Agricultural Warehouse Management Office of the Anhui Provincial Government will build agricultural warehouses. The contracts have been negotiated and will be formally signed soon.</p>
<p>Regional Divisions Specified. Warehouse construction is divided into two types: provincial warehouses and county warehouses. It is planned to build a total of 100 warehouses. In addition to renovating existing warehouses, the remaining locations have been surveyed and construction has begun. All are limited to completion before this year's autumn harvest. The storage and mortgage loan areas have also been specified. 1.

<p>Zeng Yiafu, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee, has completed his inspection of the cocoon-producing areas in Zhejiang. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Zeng yesterday and was informed of the details of this year's cocoon production in Zhejiang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Abundant Spring Cocoon Harvest</p>
<p>After the new cocoons entered the market this year, Zeng went to inspect the cocoon-producing areas in Zhejiang, and the development of improved breeds and the quantity of cocoons produced in various places were very good. The improved seeds issued in Zhejiang Province amounted to about 1.2 million sheets, with an average cocoon yield of more than 30 catties. Therefore, the total output of spring cocoons in Zhejiang Province this year was about 360,000 dan of fresh cocoons for improved breeds and about 180,000 dan of fresh cocoons for native breeds. As for the quality of improved cocoons in Jiaxing, Wuxing, Yuji, Lin'an and other places, most of them are very good, with a reeling waste of less than 400 catties. The cocoon quality in Wukang, Chongde and other places is relatively poor, because they are relatively close to the native seed production area in Yuyao. The reeling waste is about 450 catties.</p>
<p>Unified Committee Collects Cocoons</p>
<p>In order to help farmers, the Sericulture Control Committee borrowed 5 million yuan from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to purchase the remaining cocoons in Zhejiang Province this spring. The collection of cocoons is handled by the Spring Cocoon Collection Committee in the 25th year. As expected, the spring cocoon harvest this year was abundant. Although silk merchants and remaining cocoon merchants absorbed as much as possible, there was still a surplus of about 100,000 dan of fresh cocoons, which were all purchased by the Unified Committee. The collected cocoons are issued to the silk reeling committee, and the 3,000 new-style silk reeling machines of the Zhejiang Silk Factory, which are guided by the Unified Committee, are used to reel silk. The reeled silk is sold by the raw silk promotion office. Most of it is still sold through Shanghai exporters as in the previous year, and a part is sold directly to foreign markets by the promotion office.</p>
<p>Balancing Cocoon Prices</p>
<p>The Cocoon Control Committee stipulated the central cocoon price for silk merchants and remaining cocoon merchants to purchase spring cocoons this year. The negotiated price for improved breeds was 30 yuan, and the negotiated price for native breeds was 21 yuan. At the same time, it strictly prohibited raising or suppressing prices. Later, it was reported that most of the cocoon merchants purchased cocoons in accordance with this central cocoon price, but some of the negotiated prices were slightly lower. The provincial government paid great attention to protecting farmers. For the cocoons that had been collected, those with a negotiated price below the central cocoon price were withheld by 40% and samples were taken for testing. If the reeling waste is large and the purchase price is low, and the proportion is calculated to be consistent with the 550 catties of the stipulated central cocoon price, there is no problem because it is the same as the principles reviewed by the Unified Committee.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency in Seed Production</p>
<p>This year, the improved spring cocoon seeds in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces issued about 400,000 sheets, which were ordered from abroad. The cocoons produced by these seeds are of very good quality. The Jiaxing branch seed production farm, which was established by the Zhejiang Unified Committee, is actively proceeding. It is expected that from next year onwards, our country can be self-sufficient in silkworm eggs and will not have to purchase them from abroad. It is expected that next year's spring seeds will produce 3.5 million sheets in our country. If each sheet produces 30 catties of cocoons, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang can produce more than 1 million dan of cocoons, not to mention the native breeds. Now farmers have great faith in improved breeds, so it is expected that native breeds will gradually decrease from next year onwards.</p>
<p>Release of Detained Cocoons</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee, under the order of the provincial government, detained the silk merchants and remaining cocoon merchants who purchased spring cocoons in Zhejiang Province if their negotiated prices were below the standard number (21 yuan for native breeds and 30 yuan for improved breeds). The Shanghai Silk Factory Abandonment Association telegraphed to request the release. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from Shanghai silk merchants yesterday that the cocoons that had been detained by the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee have been released as counted, and samples have been taken for testing the reeling waste to determine the method of disposal and urging. In the future, the fines will be deducted from the guarantee deposits of the cocoon merchants.</p>

<p>The city's active efforts to promote uniform Party and National Flags have been reported in previous issues. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Mayor Wu again dispatched representative Li Dachao to convene branch directors, team leaders, and related organizations at the YMCA in Baxianqiao to discuss how to universally use the uniform Party and National Flags throughout the city and complete the task as soon as possible. Chairman Li Dachao reported that the Mayor is extremely concerned about the progress of unifying Party and National Flags. He had previously inquired about the progress, and the reports of personnel dispatched to promote it in various districts over the past few days were submitted. The Mayor believes that this method is slow and needs improvement, so he instructed them to come up with a better solution and asked everyone to discuss it together, hoping to find a satisfactory solution and complete the task as soon as possible, to refresh the city's image. Zhang Ziyong then reported on the implementation methods in Nanjing and Xi'an, and Huang Qiguang and Yao Guangding reported on their opinions regarding promotional publicity. A discussion then began. It was resolved that: The Uniform Promotion Committee will expand publicity on the meaning and use of Party and National Flags; The Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau will send personnel to be stationed at the household registration offices of each branch bureau to promote the Party and National Flags nearby to facilitate purchase; Notices will be printed and distributed to each household according to the household registration of each branch bureau, setting a deadline for purchasing and preparing the uniform Party and National Flags; If stores do not prepare the uniform Party and National Flags, they will be summoned by the bureaus and ordered to purchase them within a deadline, with appropriate penalties for exceeding the deadline. As for the special zone, civic groups will strive to promote the implementation, aiming to have the entire city uniformly hang the flags on July 9th, the anniversary of the Northern Expedition's oath-taking.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation, considering that smuggling in North China is rampant and widespread, and that the domestic goods market will inevitably be seized if it is not rescued promptly, has decided, in order to actively promote domestic goods to save the situation, to convene a joint meeting of the three groups responsible for domestic and foreign publicity. It was resolved to appoint Huang Renzhi, Pan Yangyao, etc., to be responsible for forming a domestic goods inspection and publicity team, with three people in each group. Given the urgency of departure, it was decided to first form one group, carrying promotional materials and domestic samples, to go to Xunhan and other places in the Yangtze River Basin to inspect local domestic goods facilities and the impact of smuggling. Reports will be made to the Federation at any time to compile statistics for reference. At the same time, large-scale publicity will be carried out in the places they visit to make the local people understand the actual situation of domestic goods, so as to promote confidence in using them. The selection of personnel for the team has been decided, and preparations are being actively made for departure, as well as collecting samples from various domestic factories to carry for publicity. As soon as preparations are complete, they will set off immediately. At the same time, the Women's Domestic Goods Usage Group organized by the Federation is also actively proceeding after agreeing on the steps with the Municipal Women's Association. It is expected to be formally established within the month.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Lawyers' Association Exposes Negligence of Supervision by Banks and Native Banks, Offering No Practical Benefit to Creditors, Should be Reprimanded, and Husband and Horse Expenses Recovered <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association submitted a document to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, stating that, according to a proposal by member Xu Zuoliang and others, since the government promulgated the "Supervision and Liquidation Measures for Banks and Native Banks," it has appointed one supervisor for each of the Shanghai banks and native banks that have ceased operations, with the banks or native banks giving them preferential monthly husband and horse expenses of 200 or 300 yuan. This money is for the repayment of debts, but giving it preferentially to the supervisor has actually caused losses to the creditors. If the supervisors could truly break through sentiments and fulfill their responsibilities in accordance with the provisions of the measures, the creditors would be willing to endure it for the sake of jointly protecting their interests. However, in reality, it is the opposite. Specifically: According to the second clause of the measures, the liquidation is limited to three months from the date of suspension of operations. However, each of the liquidators has been in office for more than a year in most cases, and at least six months in a few, without ever convening a creditors' meeting or reporting in detail the property inventory and loan comparison table of the bank or native bank. They are simply holding their positions without doing anything, which is a dereliction of duty. According to the third clause of the measures, if any managers or directors are found to have engaged in illegal or fraudulent activities during the liquidation period, they should be placed under custody and dealt with according to law. However, all of the closed banks and native banks in Shanghai were caused by illegal or fraudulent activities by managers and directors, and some victims have even filed lawsuits and been sentenced by the court. However, no supervisor has been heard to have reported or placed the managers or directors under custody and punished them according to law. Recently, it was reported that after the collapse of Meifeng Bank, the liquidator reported that the manager Lei Wen was sentenced to imprisonment. However, the directors and supervisors of all the Chinese banks and native banks that have ceased operations are still at large. Some say that the protection of creditors by Chinese people is not as thorough as that by Westerners, which is not without reason. According to the fourth clause of the measures, after the assets are discounted, if they are not sufficient to offset the liabilities, in addition to limited liability companies that should be declared bankrupt, the shareholders and managers of other banks and native banks should bear joint liability. According to the fifth clause, if there is any intention to escape or conceal or reduce property, they may be placed under custody or wanted. However, after the suspension of operations of the various banks and native banks in Shanghai, many assets have been evaded or destroyed, and the liquidators have not taken preventive measures beforehand, nor have they heard of any punishment afterwards, which is of no practical benefit to creditors. Based on the members' limited views, it is believed that the position of liquidator is stipulated by the liquidation measures and cannot be compared with ordinary concurrent positions that only receive dry salaries without doing anything. It is appropriate to request correction and immediately reprimand the negligent liquidators and supervisors, and recover the husband and horse expenses as a warning. Therefore, this request is submitted for your examination and approval so that you may correct the situation to relieve the business distress and maintain creditors’ rights in a fair manner. Respectfully submitted to Director Jiang of the Executive Yuan. Respectfully submitted by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association. It is heard that the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan has replied to the Association yesterday, briefly stating that it has been sent to the Ministry of Finance for investigation. Please be informed.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Chinese and Foreign Relief Federation - Completion of Road Construction by Xuzhou Work Relief <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The China Chinese and Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief Federation at No. 505 Henan Road, in order to relieve the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, specially allocated funds to carry out work relief and established the Northern Jiangsu Yellow Disaster Work Relief Office to supervise it. It was originally planned to repair the Weishan Lake embankment and the Xuzhou-Haizhou highway, but due to the vast yellow water in the Weihu area, construction could not be carried out. Therefore, the original plan was changed to only repair the Xuhai highways in Xuzhou and Haizhou, and the route was extended. The Xuzhou side was presided over by Pastor Peng Yong'en in the local area, and the Haizhou side was requested to be organized by Pastor Hu Lelin. Engineer Zhang Jichun was also sent to plan and supervise the projects in both places. Since construction began simultaneously in February of this year, the roads built in Xuzhou, in addition to the ten-li around-the-city road, also included five highways, namely: Tongpei Road, from Beimen Bridge to Zhengji, is fifty li long and is an important transportation route from Xuzhou to Tongpei Feng. Passing through Ping Shankou, the road surface is very high, and it is very difficult for trains to go up and down, and they often overturn and injure people. The Yamaguchi was blown down by two zhang with dynamite, widened by one zhang, and opened into a wide road to facilitate travel. The road is paved with crushed stones, and three stone bridges are built, which is the most expensive of the roads built. Tong Sui Road, from Chengnan to Liangshankou, is thirty li long. The road is located in the old course of the Yellow River and is purely loose and less soil-like, which is inconvenient for vehicles to pass. Now, red clay from Yunlong Mountain is used, mixed with one-third of sandy soil, to build the road surface, and the motor vehicle and ox cart lanes are paved separately. Because the clay is taken from other places, mining and transportation are very troublesome. Tong Dang Road, from Chengxi to Hao'an, is thirty li long; Tong Su Road, from Chengnan to Sanguan Temple, is ten li long; Tong Xiao Road, from Chengbei to Yaolou, is thirty li long. The width of each road is 12 meters as stipulated by the Provincial Construction Department, which can accommodate motor vehicles and ox carts, and the upper and lower lanes are driven separately, with drainage ditches on both sides to facilitate drainage. The encircling road has been badly damaged, and it has now been renovated. The road construction in Haizhou is from Xiangshuikou to Banpu, passing through Tongxingji Yangjiaji, with a total of three sections, and then northwest from Banpu to Xinpu, a total of one hundred and twenty li long. Half of the old roads are repaired and half are newly built. Between Banpu and Xinpu, the embankment is repaired and reinforced along the river. The width of this road is the same as that built in Xuzhou, which is very important to the traffic in northern Jiangsu. Because Xiangshuikou is located at the mouth of the Dachao River, land and sea transportation can be connected after it is built, and it can be connected to the highway passing through Dongkan Funing and arriving at Jiancheng. In Xinpu, it can also be connected to the highway passing through Haizhou Shuyang to Qingjiangpu. The work relief this time requires approximately 45,000 yuan in Xuzhou and approximately 27,000 yuan in Haizhou. The purpose is to relieve the disaster, and construction is the price. Therefore, more than 2,500 disaster workers are employed, regardless of their strength or weakness. Strong men are ordered to be responsible for the arduous tasks of opening roads in the mountains, while the old and weak only sit and hit gravel, which is easy and convenient. The average wage per person is 25 cents a day, so as to provide a simple life for individuals and families. It is reported that the Haizhou road project is progressing slowly due to the continuous spring rain and the construction of river dikes, and the completion date is still uncertain. However, Xuzhou has been completed last week, and the completion ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 12th of this month. Local officials and representatives from all walks of life will be invited to participate, and the test drive will be carried out together, and then the opening will be accepted by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Tong District Commissioner.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Zhaoshangju requests in the Li Guojie case: Investigate Guarantor Assets in Detail; If the Guarantor Fails to Provide Sufficient Assets, Request the Case to be Summoned and Arrested to Pursue the Defendant's Debt <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The case of the state-owned Zhaoshangju being embezzled of public funds of 700,000 taels by Li Guojie has been concluded by the final trial of the High Court. The judgment was final, ordering Li Guojie to compensate the full amount, including interest, totaling more than 1 million yuan. The Bureau entrusted lawyer Jiang Hechun to appear in court as an agent for the execution of the case transmitted on the 6th of this month, requesting that the defendant Li Guojie continue to be detained and execute the compensation payment. The court ruled that He De and Li Sihao acted as guarantors for Li Guojie's release and were required to ensure that he was available whenever summoned. If he failed to appear when summoned, the guarantors would be responsible for all debts. Now, the Zhaoshangju believes that the national currency is no small matter, in order to clarify the responsibilities of the guarantors and request the defendant to quickly list his assets and submit them to the case for payment, it has again sent a letter to the court. The original text is excerpted above. To the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court: In the state-owned Zhaoshangju's lawsuit against Li Guojie for embezzlement of public funds, the attached civil suit for compensation for losses has been finalized by the final trial, ordering Li Guojie to compensate the Zhaoshangju with 700,000 Shanghai taels, plus interest, etc. On the 6th of this month, the execution of the case transmitted was received, and lawyer Jiang Hechun was entrusted as an agent to appear in court, requesting that the defendant Li Guojie continue to be detained and execute the compensation payment, and the authorized agent lawyer solemnly declared repeatedly in court that the matter belonged to public funds, the case was of great importance, and it should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for instructions. Your court ruled that Li Guojie was allowed to be released on bail by He De (i.e., Qiaqing) and Li Sihao (Zanhou), and the guarantors were to bear full responsibility for the case if Li Guojie failed to appear in the future, and it was also recorded in court that the guarantors signed and acknowledged it. The decision to detain or release the defendant on bail is the jurisdiction of the court, and our bureau should respect it. However, the circumstances of this case are serious, the amount of debt is huge, and it is related to national property. It is, of course, no small matter, and the attention of China and foreign countries is extensive. The guarantors, in their personal capacity, bear the heavy responsibility of guaranteeing such a huge amount of debt. Whether their financial resources are sufficient to bear this responsibility is a matter that our bureau cannot but solemnly declare and should request the court to carefully investigate and review, ordering the guarantors to provide sufficient proof to emphasize the responsibility of the guarantee. If the guarantors fail to provide sufficient assets to guarantee the amount owed by the defendant, we still request your court to summon and arrest the defendant to pursue the debt and emphasize the importance of public funds. As for the defendant's willingness to be released on bail and to investigate and provide all his assets for execution, it cannot be indefinite and beyond the law. Your court should order him to do so within one month to facilitate the execution, so that the facts can be dealt with and the public funds will not be without a source. It was stated to the agent in court yesterday, for fear that the record might not be fully restored, so as to facilitate the application for continued execution. If the approved period expires and the defendant still fails to declare his assets, your court should summon him to be detained according to law to emphasize public funds and extend legal rights.

<p>Song Xihou, a native of Yuyao who resided at No. , Sida Village, Lane 142, Rémusat Road, French Concession, and was the compradore of the Shanghai office of the British Hezhilin Cotton Yarn Company, was suddenly visited by two men in suits at noon the day before yesterday who brought a letter and asked to see him. The servant reported, and Song met them in the living room for a conversation. After less than a few minutes, the young men drew their guns and fired at Song, hitting him in the abdomen. Song's concubine, Ms. Cao, and the maids Yu Xie and Xu Yu were also shot in the back of the head, face, and legs. The murderers fled the scene, and Song's daughter, Meizhen, called the French Concession police to send the four injured people to the hospital for treatment. However, Song Xihou's injuries were in a vital area, and although the doctors at Guangci Hospital performed surgery to treat him, it was difficult to save him. He died at 9:00 PM that night, and the hospital notified the police. Yesterday morning, the Special No. 2 Court Prosecutor's Office reported it, and Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan, along with forensic doctor Jiang Xuan and clerk Zhao Yifen, etc., arrived at Guangci Hospital at 10:30 AM to examine the body. They then sat down to hear the case, and the detectives reported on the investigation of the case. The deceased's wife, Song Luo (age 50), requested to claim the body for burial, arrest the murderer, and seek justice. The official ordered that Song Xihou was found to have died from gunshot wounds. The body was handed over to the deceased's wife, Song Luo, for burial, and the murderer was to be arrested by the police department. After the examination, the family members took the body to the funeral home for burial.</p>

<p>Wu Yujing, a native of Anhui, aged 43, who works as a driver No. 214 at the Foch Road branch of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, and his wife, Wu Chen (25, Anhui native), live together on the mezzanine of No. 3, Tonghe Lane, Foch Road. However, Ms. Chen had an affair with Zhang Junmou, a Chinese detective No. 2650 of the Huishan Patrol Room, an Anhui native, a month ago. On the 27th of last month, Ms. Wu Chen suddenly left home. Wu Yujing, together with his tenants Jiao Changgui and his wife as witnesses, went to the Chengdu Road Patrol Room to report that his wife Chen had been abducted by Detective Zhang. After an investigation by the Patrol Room, no evidence was found,</p>
<p>No Arrest Made</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhang Junmou learned of this matter and resented that Jiao Maopi, Jiao Gui's wife, should not have intervened. In a fit of anger, he decided to kill her. At about 5:00 a.m. on the 2nd of this month, he drove a Republic Motors car with Wu Chen to the front of No. 3, Tonghe Lane, and opened fire, killing Jiao Changgui and wounding Jiao's wife in the head with bullets. Detective Zhang was also wounded by a Chinese detective when he fled. He and Wu Chen were taken to the Patrol Room together. The injured were all sent to the hospital for treatment. Wu Chen was sent to the First Special Court, requesting that she be detained. This has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial of this case in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant, Zhang Junmou,</p>
<p>Sustained Minor Injuries</p>
<p>was brought from the hospital to the court by the Patrol Room and sat to be questioned. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Patrol Room, stood up and stated the case, saying that the Municipal Council is now prosecuting the defendant for murder under Articles 271 and 12 of the Criminal Law. Although Jiao Changgui's wife is now out of danger, she will need at least three weeks before she can be discharged from the hospital. According to her statement in the hospital, Wu Chen was also beside Zhang Junmou when he opened fire. He then presented a pistol and bullets used by Zhang Junmou at the time as evidence. Zhang Junmou confessed that he had been</p>
<p>Serving as a Chinese Detective</p>
<p>for seven years and had only been having an affair with Wu Chen for over a month. After Wu Chen left home on the 28th of last month, she met with me and said that she wanted to work at the Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. On the 1st of this month, at 4:00 p.m., after I finished my duties and returned to the Patrol Room, I suddenly received an order from the Patrol Chief to keep me in the room temporarily. I asked the Patrol Chief why I was not allowed to rest because I had to go on night duty that night. Unexpectedly, half an hour later, detectives from the Chengdu Road Patrol Room arrived and took me away for questioning, accusing me of abducting Wu Chen. At that time, in addition to the husband of the woman,</p>
<p>Wu Yujing's Uncle,</p>
<p>there was Jiao Maopi, the wife of the tenant Jiao Changgui, as a witness. As a result, because it had nothing to do with me, I was immediately released. When I returned to the Huishan Patrol Room, Wu Chen happened to meet me on the way, so I invited her to go to Room 26 of the Tiande Hotel on Dalian Road as a place to talk. At that time, I was quite angry in my heart and wanted to commit suicide. I also thought that this matter was all due to Jiao Maopi's intervention and fabrication of facts, so I would not be able to relieve the anger in my heart unless she was put to death. When Wu Chen heard this, she also wanted to express her desire to commit suicide. Because my night duty time had arrived, I asked the tea server to pay attention to Wu Chen's actions to prevent her from</p>
<p>Taking the Opportunity to Commit Suicide.</p>
<p>I went to the Patrol Room for duty, but because I was in a state of confusion and had a negative attitude, I had no intention of going on duty, so I soon left my post on my own, changed into casual clothes, and returned to the Tiande Hotel. After discussion, at 4:30 a.m. on the 2nd, I took a rickshaw with Wu Chen and went out. We transferred to a car at the Republic Motors Company and drove to No. 3, Tonghe Lane. A Muslim opened the door and let us in. After talking to her husband, Wu Yujing, for a few words, Wu went out, saying that he was going to the company to ask for leave. Wu Chen and I followed him out. Later, Wu Yujing took the opportunity to drive to the Patrol Room to report. I then returned to Tonghe Lane and went upstairs, where I saw Jiao Maopi</p>
<p>Was Combing Her Hair.</p>
<p>I drew my gun and fired a shot at her. Her husband, Jiao Changgui, suddenly stepped forward and grabbed my hand, trying to take the pistol. I fired another shot, knocking Jiao down. Then I fired another shot, hitting Jiao Maopi in the head. I then fled and was wounded by a patrolling detective. Although Jiao Changgui's death was unjust, it cannot be blamed on me. He can only hate his wife in the underworld. Finally, he cursed Wu Yujing, Wu Chen's husband, pointing out that he was not a good person. He was then stopped by the court. According to Jiao Changgui's ten-year-old son, Dingqiao, who testified about Zhang's shooting, and Wu Chen's confession, the two defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody separately and await the adjourned hearing on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Rickshaw Industry Association Opposes Modification of Wheels, Yesterday Sent a Letter to the Municipal Council Stating Various Reasons, Requesting a Halt to Implementation Based on Members' Opinions <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association, in order to oppose the modification of wheels, yesterday sent a letter to Zhong Si, the Director-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council, which stated, "Dear Sir, Regarding the matter of modifying the wheels of rickshaws, since your Bureau announced that it would be implemented on July 1 of this year, our members have felt significant obstacles in terms of business use and economy, and are deeply disturbed. They have requested that your Bureau be asked to stop the implementation. The reasons why the members find it impossible to accept are summarized as follows: The old-fashioned wheels of rickshaws are lightweight and suitable, and there has never been any problem with them. If the width is increased and the three-and-a-half-angle iron wheels are modified, they will inevitably be bulky and difficult to operate. If rubber tires are installed, the hardness will be uneven with the road surface, which will not only be inconvenient to use, but also the value of each set of rubber tires will be at least 16 yuan in national currency, and they can only be used for one year, while the old-fashioned wheels are only worth 3 yuan in national currency per set and can be guaranteed for more than ten years. The price is several times higher than the old-fashioned wheels. Even in terms of the cost of each rickshaw, it does not exceed 20 yuan. Now the value of one wheel is so high. In the current situation of a sluggish market and a declining business, how can people who earn a living with their blood and sweat bear this kind of burden suddenly? Therefore, in fact, it is impossible to accept either the modification of iron wheels or rubber tires. As for the issue of rickshaw load, because the restrictions are too strict, violations occur at every turn, and the suffering suffered in business is difficult to express. It should be requested that the load limit for single-person vehicles be 700 pounds, and the load limit for double-person vehicles be 1,000 pounds. Regarding the issue of modifying wheels, our association submitted a letter to your Bureau on December 5, 1935, to contribute opinions, and a reply was approved. Now the date for the regulation on modifying wheels is approaching, and the members are finding it difficult to maintain their livelihoods due to the sluggish business, and it is impossible to increase the unexpected burden again. Since we have been requested to come forward, we have prepared another letter to reach you. We urge your Bureau to consider the hardships of the workers, stop the implementation, and also handle the issue of load with flexibility. We hope you will investigate and reply to this letter. Sincerely, Zhong Si, Director-General of the Municipal Council."</p>

<p>Xu Wancheng, an editor at the Longwen Bookstore at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Baiyang Third Lane, Dananmen, published a special issue of the "Xu Wancheng Work Report" in the Minbao, which contained an investigation into the dark side of the Chinese judiciary. The content pointed out the theft of pistols from the dirty goods warehouse of the local court, etc., and the bribery of Judge Zhao, etc. The two judges of the local court, Zhao Yongzhou and Zhao Yuesheng, believed that Xu Wancheng had deliberately defamed them, and therefore filed a complaint with the procuratorate to investigate the matter according to the law. The previous day, Prosecutor Tang summoned Xu Wancheng for questioning and detention, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Prosecutor Tang filed a public prosecution against Xu Wancheng yesterday afternoon for the crimes of obstructing official duties and defamation. The indictment has been sent to the detention center by the police, and it should be possible to open the trial soon.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Unscrupulous Husband Has an Affair Outside, Mother and Children Want to Drown Themselves, A Family of Six Bound Together with Ropes and Commit Suicide, Borrowing Money Causes Debt and Neglects Support <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, a mother and her five children were found on the Bund of the Huangpu River outside the Four Horse Road, bound together with hemp ropes, attempting to commit suicide by drowning. Fortunately, they were spotted by a patrol officer, who rescued them and took them to the Central Patrol Room. According to the woman's statement, she is Liu Sun, 39 years old, a native of Ningbo, living at No. 57, Yiyuan Lane, Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi, Chinese Concession. Her husband's name is Liu Xianwen, also from the same hometown and the same age as the woman. They have four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Yiti, 17 years old, is an apprentice at the Ruifeng Rice Store. The eldest daughter, Yachun, 21 years old, is married to Chen Huigen, who is in the rice business. The second daughter, Xinmei, is 19 years old. The third daughter, Aizhu, is 11 years old. The second son, Yiji, is 14 years old. The third son, Yisen, is 7 years old. The youngest son, Yixin, is 3 years old. Recently, her husband has been neglecting his duties and having an affair with a procuress named Cai outside. They live together at No. 8, Dongping Lane, Zhejiang Road, British Concession. Last year, he falsely claimed that he was going to be a compradore for a foreign company. Sun borrowed 1,000 yuan from relatives, with her father as guarantor. Now he has lost everything. This suicide was actually caused by her husband's neglect of support and despair of life, which led to this desperate measure. Therefore, except for the eldest son, her three sons and two daughters all followed their mother to drown themselves, etc. After the Patrol Room obtained the statement, they sent detectives to accompany them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th of last month, the Qianyixiang Hotel at No. 393, Meibai Ge Road, was suddenly invaded by two armed thugs, who robbed the hotel of 8,000 in legal tender. At that time, because the hotel employee Liu Zhifu resisted by holding a chair, he was shot and killed by the robbers, and Fan Tianfu was wounded by bullets. Later, the Xinzha Patrol Room successively arrested suspected criminals, including former security regiment platoon leader Hua Jinsen, Xu Renhe, Huang Yi, and public security bureau detectives Zhang Zuoxian, Zheng Bu*, Wang Yu*, and seventeen men and women. One pistol and six bullets used in the crime were seized and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. It was found that seven of them were not involved and were released first. The remaining ten, including Hua Jinsen, were remanded in custody pending interrogation, as has been reported in this newspaper many times. It is now known that Bao Ziying, the squad leader of the detective division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested Xu Guang (also known as Xu Jinying), a bandit from Jiangbei, a few days ago. At that time, Xu had injuries on his face. After investigation by the Xinzha Patrol Room, it was found that Xu was the main culprit in the Qianyixiang Hotel robbery and murder case. The injuries on his face were caused by the deceased Liu Qiafu hitting him with a chair. Therefore, they went to the Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday and brought Xu Guang back to the Patrol Room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Patrol Room, stated the case, saying that Xu Guang was found to be involved not only in the robbery and murder case, but also in the kidnapping of the three-year-old child of the Huangsha Stone Company in Zhabei a few days ago, and the case of shooting *Fang. Therefore, he requested permission to *detain him. Fan Tianfu, a fourteen-year-old apprentice, testified that he witnessed the defendant threatening them with a gun and another robber taking money. Later, Liu Qiafu resisted, and the defendant shot him dead with one shot, and then fired two shots, wounding Fan Dafu. When questioned, the defendant Xu Guang confessed that he and the deceased Liu Qiafu wanted to snatch the pistol, which caused it to misfire and accidentally injure him. Judge Huang ordered Xu to be remanded in custody pending joint trial.</p>

<p>Jiang Xingsheng, a native of Changzhou, 26 years old, who lived at No. 284, Fulili Road, French Concession, used to work at the Qiming Yarn Factory on Xietu Road, Dapu Bridge. He stopped working and idled, living a vagrant life with other hooligans and loafers nearby. Recently, a new store opened on Fulili Road, and Jiang went to negotiate a protection fee of three yuan. He did not receive it at the time. The next day, Jiang ordered a fellow hooligan named A Xiang to collect the money, but A Xiang kept it for himself, which led to a feud between the two. The day before yesterday (8th), at 9:00 a.m., A Xiang went to Jiang's house to ask Jiang for a loan, but failed. At 7:00 p.m., A Xiang went to Jiang's house again and lured Jiang out. In a secluded place, A Xiang suddenly pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed Jiang more than ten times in the left and right arms, legs, and back. He then fled. Jiang was usually strong, and after being injured, he ran to his friend Xu Fugen, 29 years old, a native of Wuxi, who lived in a flat house in Kangjiazhai, Fulili Road, and asked him to send him to the hospital for treatment immediately. Xu hired a car and sent him to Guangci Hospital, but he died at 12:00 p.m. due to excessive bleeding from the wounds. The hospital reported to the French Patrol Room, which sent detectives to investigate and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy, and notified Jiang Bai, the wife of the deceased, to come to the case. Yesterday morning, a report was made to the Special Court, and Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan and forensic medical officers, etc., arrived at the place at noon to verify that the deceased had died from knife wounds sustained before death. After questioning the deceased's wife and witness Xu Fugen, he ordered the deceased's wife, Jiang Bai, to claim the body, and the murderer was to be arrested by the Xiangwu Office.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Unable to Endure Debt Pressure, Chen Xuebao Dies by Poison, His Brother Reports to the Police, Huang Shushen and Others Detained <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xuebao, a native of Huai'an, (48 years old), lived on Zhonghua Xin Road, Pushan Road, Zhabei, and worked at the Fuxin Factory to make a living. His wife had passed away. Last year, through a friend Dai Rong, he married Ms. Li from Ningbo as his second wife. Chen Xuebao was in financial straits, so he asked his friend Gao San to borrow 15 yuan from Huang Shushen, using his work badge as collateral (monthly interest of 2 yuan). Unexpectedly, Ms. Li had not been married long before she returned to Ningbo on the pretext of going home, and swept away the household items and clothing, never to return. After Chen searched everywhere, there was no trace of her. It was like releasing a pigeon without return, and he lost both his person and his money. He spent his days sighing in frustration and had no heart to work, which led to his situation becoming increasingly difficult. Recently, the creditor Huang Shushen asked Chen Xuebao to pay back the debt. Chen had no way to pay, so he sold six piglets raised in his house and obtained 21 yuan, which he paid back in full. Huang Shushen believed that Chen Xuebao owed 24 yuan in principal and interest, and still owed 3 yuan, and refused to return the factory badge that Chen had mortgaged. Chen Xuebao was anxious and went to the factory foreman Yu Shaotang for help. Yu not only refused to help, but also helped Huang Shushen extort payment, otherwise he would stop Chen from working forever. Chen Xuebao was extremely worried upon hearing this. Because his house was bare and he could not work, he felt that life was worse than death, so he secretly took poison and died the day before yesterday. After his brother Chen Xueru found out, he reported the information to the Xinzha Branch, which ordered the police to detain Huang Shushen, Dai Rong, Yu Shaotang, and others and send them to the Public Security Bureau. At the same time, he ordered the local guarantor Wang Shaoting to report to the local court for an autopsy. Zhang Zi, the prosecutor commissioned by the court, and Shen Qixiu, the autopsy officer, *were present. Chen Xuebao's autopsy confirmed that he had died from taking poison. A form was filled out, and it was ruled that the family could claim the coffin. The defendants will be sent to court for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Chinese Compradore of British Public Bus Company, Song Zi'ang Confesses to Embezzling Public Funds, Due to Failed Speculation, Misappropriated More Than 70,000 Gold Yuan, Police Press Charges of Occupational Embezzlement <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese compradore of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company was originally Song Lifeng, a native of Chuansha, Pudong. All the company's accounts for salaries and expenses of employees were under his management. In 1929, Zhu Lifeng was transferred to the position of General Manager of the Hankou First Yarn Factory of the British-owned Anli Foreign Firm. The vacancy left by the General Omnibus Company was filled by Zhu Lifeng's cousin Song Zi'ang (formerly an employee in the compradore's office). Song Zi'ang usually handled affairs quite well, so he was deeply trusted by the authorities. However, since last year, Song Zi'ang suddenly engaged in speculative businesses and suffered repeated losses, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan. Even all his property, such as shares in the Baoda Qianzhuang at No. 15 Shandong Road, was not enough to pay off his debts. The creditors continued to press for payment, and Song was unable to cope. He sold the copper coins stored in the warehouse at No. 1171 Kangnao Road for approximately 92,000 yuan in national currency, and embezzled more than 10,000 yuan in company salaries issued to employees. In total, the amount of embezzlement reached 73,759 yuan and 73 cents. Song knew that this matter could not be concealed in the end, so at 8:45 a.m. the day before yesterday, he went to the General Patrol Room with lawyer Yu Xiangqin to surrender himself. After investigation by West Detective Ha Hui and Chinese Detective, Song Zi'ang was detained. Yesterday morning, the Patrol Room lawyer Wang* Tang explained the situation to the First Special District Court Criminal Court, stating that according to the defendant's confession, the total amount of embezzlement was 73,759 yuan and 73 cents, but according to the number issued by the General Omnibus Company, it was 76,666 yuan and 69 cents. The Patrol Room is now prosecuting the case according to Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for the crime of occupational embezzlement and requesting a judgment according to the law. The General Omnibus Company also commissioned lawyer Fan Gang to appear in court and file a civil suit. The company's representative Gao Ersiden also went to court to explain the accounts. The Patrol Room lawyer Wang also said that regarding the more than 50,000 yuan of copper coins, because the company learned that the central government was going to collect copper coins, it stored the copper coins from ticket sales over the past few months in wooden boxes in the warehouse, waiting for the price to rise before selling them. The defendant sold the copper coins to the qianzhuang one after another, so although the wooden boxes in the warehouse still exist, the copper coins inside have been sold. When questioned, Song Zi'ang confessed that he was 山 for failing in speculation and did not deny it. Lawyer Yu Xiangqin requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail so that he could go outside and negotiate with the plaintiff on a settlement method for the civil suit. The plaintiff's agent lawyer Fan Gang also agreed to this request. Judge Feng Shide ordered that the case be adjourned for another week. Zhu Zi'ang paid a 20,000 yuan shop guarantee and guaranteed to be present whenever summoned.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Zhou Exuan Sues Zhang Zhuying Again, The Relationship Between Him and Du Nan Has Been Established, Now Willing to Pay 15 Yuan per Month for Living Expenses <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Exuan, the son of Zhou Weishi, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou who was traveling in Shanghai, favored a famous prostitute named Zhang Zhuying. After she became pregnant, he removed her name from the register and planned to place her in a concubine's room. When Weishi found out about this, he strictly ordered his son to break off relations with the prostitute. Exuan had to part with her and handed over the son, Du Nan, to Zhang for upbringing, with a monthly living allowance. Until the previous year, Zhang requested that Zhou increase the living expenses for the son from 50 yuan per month to 70 yuan, which was rejected by Zhou. The original amount was also stopped, so she accused Zhou of abandonment in the Xiyuan and sentenced him to six months in prison with a suspended sentence. After the case was finalized, Zhou hoped to avoid Zhang Zhuying representing her son to demand education expenses, so he filed a lawsuit against Zhang for the guardianship of Du Nan, requesting that Zhang hand over Du Nan to him for education and guardianship. However, after three trials, Zhou's lawsuit failed. Now Zhou has started anew, hired lawyer Huang Yi, and submitted another statement to the First Special District Court, saying that since his father-son relationship with Du Nan has been established, the living expenses of Du Nan should naturally be borne by him and is willing to give 15 yuan per month for support. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo opened a court hearing. The defendant Zhang Zhuying and Du Nan commissioned lawyer Xiang Xun to appear in court. First, lawyer Huang stated the intention of the prosecution, saying that the plaintiff had sent a letter to the defendant in April stating the matter of giving 15 yuan per month to Du Nan for living expenses, but had not received a reply, so he filed a lawsuit. Then, lawyer Xiang raised a legal issue, saying that Zhang was Du Nan's guardian, and the plaintiff could only sue Du Nan, not include Zhang as a defendant. Lawyer Huang then amended the statement in court. Lawyer Xiang continued to say that the alimony given by Zhou Exuan was initially 50 yuan per month, and a lawsuit arose because Zhang requested an increase. Zhou has now filed this lawsuit again after losing several times, really fearing that Zhang will file a lawsuit against him in the name of guardian for a large amount of alimony. Therefore, this is a preemptive measure. The Zhou family has property of more than 10 million yuan and is only willing to give his own son a meager 15 yuan per month for living expenses, which does not seem reasonable. Lawyer Huang heard this and determined that the point of contention was the amount, so he asked the court to order the defendant to clearly state the amount they wanted for discussion. Judge Dai then ordered an adjournment for another hearing.</p>

The corpse was very fresh. It was estimated that the time of entry into the water was about five or six hours. It was also not swollen. Two Chinese detectives from the Customs Water Patrol Room spotted it and pulled the corpse to the patrol room. They found that the cause of death was quite suspicious. The patrol chief ordered the corpse to be transported to the Lifesaving Bureau and reported to the local court for an autopsy to await family members to claim it.</p>

<p>Chen Changyi, a Cantonese, opened a fruit shop in Tianjin ten years ago and was quite wealthy. He was also young and met a woman named Wu Weijun. Later, through the matchmaking of Wu's sister, the two married. Chen then took her to Shanghai to live with his parents. Chen had an original wife, Liang, who at that time accused Chen of bigamy. Wu, fearing that Chen would be found guilty, immediately expressed her willingness to be a concubine, and the lawsuit was settled. Recently, Wu left to live with her sister because Chen was becoming increasingly depraved and difficult to live with. She then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against Chen for abuse and abandonment, requesting a judgment to dissolve the relationship between husband and concubine, and ordering Chen to pay alimony of 2,500 yuan and return the passbook. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai summoned them for trial. According to the plaintiff, Wu Weijun, the defendant was addicted to opium and often abused her and neglected to support her, so she filed the lawsuit. Chen admitted to being addicted to opium, but said that he was currently trying to quit. The plaintiff disliked his poverty and now wanted to leave him, which he strongly disagreed with. As for the passbook of the Bank of China, it was given to him by the plaintiff, not taken privately. The court then ordered the two parties to go out and try to reconcile, and adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 18th of this month.</p>

A passport, a diary, a belt, a regular ticket, a brooch, twenty-five small photos, two business cards, a towel, and a wooden comb were found on him, along with the stone. They were all taken to the Hongkou police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, described the case and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 353, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law for the crime of destroying and damaging property. Then, the policeman at the second head of No. 157 reported the process of arresting the defendant, and said that the glass on the consulate's window was not damaged, but there were slight mud marks. He presented a stone for inspection. Questioning the defendant, he confessed that he could not make a living due to unemployment and stayed with a friend at No. 505, Huanlong Road, French Concession. Because he hated the Soviet government, he threw stones in a fit of anger, intending to destroy the national emblem on the window to vent his anger, and had no other intentions. He asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>Lin Tianji, a Cantonese and Deputy Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Jing Kekong, a staff member of the Ganyu County Government from Wuxing, for enticing and abandoning his daughter Jing Youmei. Because the facts listed in the complaint were unclear, the court summoned the plaintiff's father and daughter to court for questioning and ordered them to wait for review, as detailed in the report on the 3rd of this month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Bianfen continued the summons in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Lin Tianji did not appear. His wife entrusted a lawyer to court, stating that Lin had gone to Nanyang two weeks before the occurrence of this case and had now transferred to Siam. The family had already sent a telegram urging him to return to Shanghai. It would take about a month and a half before he could return to Shanghai, so she requested permission to postpone the hearing. The plaintiff Jing Kekong and his agent lawyer claimed that they had seen Lin three days ago, and yesterday Jing Youmei went to the Central Bank. According to the doorman, Lin had returned, indicating that Lin Tianji was actually in Shanghai and deliberately avoided appearing in court. They requested the court to issue a warrant for the plaintiff to designate the summons. Lin's lawyer insisted that Lin was indeed in Siam and could be investigated by the Central Bank. The judge then questioned Jing Kekong about the reason for requesting Lin to pay 72,200 yuan in civil litigation, and he replied that it was requested on behalf of his daughter and should be decided by the court together. The court reviewed the confession and decided to postpone the case for one week. Lin Tianji will be summoned by the plaintiff's designation.</p>

<p>The Dechangrun Paint Store, founded by the giant paint merchant Qiu Weiqing and others, was inherited by his sons Qiu Changsheng and Qiu Changyin and his nephew Qiu Peishan's sons Qiyuan, Qiyu, and Qitai after Qiu's death. Qiu Hengbao, a member of the same clan, claimed that Qiu Weiqing and others were all penniless when they sold public assets and came to Shanghai to open the Dechangrun Store, thus starting a family. Therefore, he should also have the right to all profits of the store. He sued Qiu Changsheng, Qiu Changyin, Qiu Qiyuan, Qiu Qiyu, and Qiu Qitai for embezzlement in the First Special District Court. After the trial, it was determined that whether Qiu Changsheng had committed a crime depended on whether Qiu Hengbao had shares in the Dechangrun Store. Qiu Hengbao was ordered to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court for confirmation, and the criminal case was suspended. Qiu Hengbao immediately followed the order and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special Court for confirmation. After years of litigation, the verdict was announced, dismissing Qiu Hengbao's lawsuit. He did not appeal after the appeal period, and the case was finalized. Unexpectedly, Qiu Hengbao now filed a statement with the court requesting that the lawsuit for infringement be withdrawn. However, according to the new Criminal Procedure Law, this type of case cannot be withdrawn. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Ninth Criminal Court for summons. Qiu Changsheng and Qiu Qiyuan and Qiu Qiyu each arrived in court with their lawyer Tao Jiachun, but Qiu Hengbao did not appear. Judge Zhan said that it was necessary to summon the plaintiff to court for questioning and decided to postpone the hearing for one week.</p>

<p>Zheng Mengxia, a Cantonese female actress and dancer who previously performed at the Tianchan Stage, and her lover, Chen Gaocong, also from Guangdong, were previously sued in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court by Xia Fubao, a Suzhou pianist (employed during the performance at the Tianchan Stage), for owing 70 yuan in wages, 1 yuan in car fare, 2 dimes for egg fried rice, and 17.5 yuan in compensation for a raincoat torn by a dog. The court granted the request. Judge Guo Wei held a hearing, but because the defendants did not appear, the plaintiff was allowed to request a unilateral debate, and the case was declared closed. A date was set for sentencing, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, it was ruled that the defendant Zheng Mengxia should pay Xia Fubao 30 yuan in national currency (this amount was for a bounced check). The plaintiff's remaining claims were dismissed. However, because Xia had reported the raincoat torn by the dog to the police station, the court did not order compensation. Xia was unwilling to accept the ruling and waited to receive the judgment to file an appeal. Zheng Mengxia also owed Xiang Sheng Automobile Company more than 40 yuan in car fare, which had not been paid for a long time. The Xiang Sheng Company commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting that Zheng be summoned to court for mediation and ordered to pay. Yesterday morning, Judge He Jingqin mediated in Civil Court No. 4. Zheng still did not appear. The court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful and ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed.</p>

Unexpectedly, the building materials were not strong, and suddenly at 7:50 AM yesterday morning, with a sudden sound, the entire house collapsed.

The deceased was wearing an Ai Guo cloth shirt and pants, with long hair.</p>

<h3 id="e180">### North China Daily News Editorial - A Frank Discussion of Recent Changes in the Southwest - Titled "Tragedy or Farce?" - Shaking the Foundation of the Country Invites a Bad Reputation <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency translated the North China Daily News editorial on the 9th: The development of events in Guangzhou in recent days is truly an ominous phenomenon for China. Chen Jitang's boastful declaration and the telegrams from Chen and Li Zongren to various parties can be taken as an expression of their true intentions, or as meaningless things. If these things are meaningless, then this is their irresponsibility, and as a result, China suffers a major loss. In recent months, the world has paid unusual attention to the China issue. The central government's active economic construction and the spirit of manly self-help shown in dealing with Sino-Japanese issues have been well received in all quarters. Chiang Kai-shek's insightful patience with the Kwantung Army's invasion of North China, and Zhang Qun's appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs, also indicate the importance of negotiating with Japan. The central government knows the danger of abandoning a compromise attitude, and local governments, no matter how independent they are, should not rashly oppose the central government, because its geographical relationship absolutely cannot make its opposition effective, but puts those close to the conflict line in an extremely difficult position. Therefore, the only effect of the recent declarations from Guangdong is to destroy China's moral credibility. They obliterated the central government's painstaking tolerance of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and at a time when the crisis is saturated, they intend to shake the foundation of China's national policy. They clearly want to use counterfeit patriotism to invite a bad reputation and cause the danger of subversion. If the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi sincerely want to open the army to the north to resist the Japanese invasion, how dare they ask how they can reach the Yangtze River basin? Li Zongren has many Japanese military advisers under his command, and they should understand a little military common sense to accomplish the purpose he claims. If the central government accepts his suggestion and allows him to have the convenience of realizing this interesting war, is he truly eager to accept this opportunity? He knows - everyone knows - he is not willing to accept it. However, observing this problem cannot be so simple. The central government's negotiations with Tokyo have fallen into an extremely difficult situation. Although it can tolerate the Southwest's division of power in internal affairs, it cannot abandon its responsibilities because of its interference. Therefore, if the Southwest continues to adopt a provocative attitude towards Japan, I am afraid that before long, the central government will be blamed by the Japanese. At that time, the means taken by the Japanese soldiers, who are full of aggressive meaning and have made precise plans, will be more serious than what the Southwest is now showing. The leader of Guangdong said, "United Front against Japan." This sentence also failed to move people much, because he put the cart before the horse. A "united front" can be said to be the prelude to the completion of the military plan, and there must be a certainty and necessity to complete this military plan first. Now, because of the need to unite the front, first there is a local military movement. Isn't this self-contradictory? The Southwest leaders claim that they do not want to cause a civil war and that they want to urge the central government to fight against Japan. They should know that these two reasons are illogical side by side. It should be known that urging the government with theory and public opinion is one thing, and mobilizing troops to invade neighboring provinces to achieve their goals is another thing. What kind of impression will this development have on the Japanese? It is difficult to predict. If the two parties have different political views and discuss their differences under the supervision of the people, then the result of such a discussion, which is free from the threat of direct action, can take accurate steps to preserve the interests of the country. Once the dark clouds of contention are cleared, the country can gain great benefits. The telegram from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee says, "If the current situation is allowed to continue, the enemy's ambitions will never be satisfied." However, we should know that domestic armed warfare gives the enemy the best opportunity to satisfy its ambitions. If China is truly in crisis, then last week's developments have further aggravated this crisis. We sincerely hope that even now, the two sides in China with different political views can accept wise advice, so as to stop the performance of this farce and avoid the final tragedy.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Shanghai's Silk Weaving and Embroidery Industry (No. 27 of the General Situation of Shanghai Industry and Commerce) Compiled by China Credit Information <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The embroidery industry is one of China's fine art crafts and occupies a considerable position in women's handicrafts. Tracing its origins, it dates back to four thousand years ago. The fu and fu of the Tang and Yu dynasties were the origins of the embroidery industry. However, from the Tang and Yu dynasties to modern times, it was only limited to the formal attire of the royal family and the official uniforms of civil and military officials, so the industry never had room for vigorous development.</p>
<p>After China opened up to overseas trade in the late Ming Dynasty, Portuguese people purchased Chinese embroidery pieces and brought them back to their country. The king greatly appreciated them, and from then on, Chinese embroidery gradually gained a reputation overseas, and Chinese people also began to pay attention to it, and the industry began to have the opportunity to gradually stand out. Since the Qing Dynasty, culture and art have progressed with each passing day, and efforts have been made to promote embroidery. In addition to royal tributes and formal attire such as python robes, shawls, and mandarin squares, other daily clothing was also prepared, and the business was booming. The annual consumption value was more than ten million taels of silver, which was the golden age of the industry.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, the clothing system has changed, and the machinery of European and American countries has evolved, and new products have emerged one after another. Clothing is generally replaced by machine-made products, and the embroidery industry has gradually declined, gradually entering a state of depression. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, the industry opened up a new path, changing embroidery products into fine art decorations and using them as gifts for relatives and friends. At that time, the social economy was still relatively prosperous, and the purchasing power was strong, so the business could be maintained. Since the twentieth year of the Republic of China, due to the frequent years of natural and man-made disasters in various parts of the country, coupled with the loss of the Northeast and the end of the Shanghai War, domestic industry and commerce were exhausted, and the economic panic became increasingly profound. Therefore, the business declined greatly. According to people in the industry, the industry's annual turnover in recent years has decreased by 70% to 80% compared with the prosperous period. The general situation of the industry is described below:</p>
<p>Types of Embroidery Products Embroidery is a famous ancient craft in China. According to its embroidery methods, it can be roughly divided into two types: one is called straight-grain embroidery, which is arranged by the method of reciprocating warp and weft; the other is called short-needle embroidery, which is accumulated by the method of five-down knotting. Straight-grain embroidery: originates from Weiting Town, Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, and is woven with colored silk warp and weft, and is called kesi, but it is rare in the market now. Short-needle embroidery is divided into Guangdong embroidery and Suzhou embroidery. Suzhou embroidery is also known as Gu embroidery, because the embroidery of figures was created by the concubine of Gu Huihai of Shanghai, who was good at needlework and embroidery. The embroidered figures are lifelike, the characters are also methodical, the embroidery products are exquisite, and the value is the most expensive, which is what is called painting embroidery. However, the Gu family has no descendants who can make it. Today, Hunan's Xiang embroidery is actually above Guangdong embroidery and Suzhou embroidery, because Xiang embroidery focuses on realism. All embroidered flowers, birds, fish, and insects are vivid and lifelike, but the needles used are too thick, which can be seen from a distance but not up close, and the price is expensive and the output is not much.</p>
<p>In recent years, in addition to the above-mentioned types, there are also Wenzhou embroidery, Saixiu embroidery, and silk woven brocade embroidery. The Wenzhou embroidery handicraft group is inferior, and the paintings are too clumsy, which often leads to drawing a tiger like a dog, which is difficult to compete with Suzhou embroidery and Xiang embroidery. Even illiterate people regard it as Gu embroidery. Saixiu embroidery is completely painted according to the paintings with gelatinous pigments. The products are still pleasing to the eye, but they are lifeless, and the gelatin is easy to fall off, so it is not durable.</p>
<p>Silk woven brocade embroidery was created in the tenth year of the Republic of China by Mr. Du Jinsheng of Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He is well-versed in machine-woven fabrics and has a lot of experience. In view of the backwardness of domestic art and crafts and sticking to old methods, he resolutely adopted the organization of straight-grain embroidery, improved it, and used new machinery for precision preparation. It is divided into two types: colored and plain. The products are fast, and there are many colors. All hand-embroidered items can be woven, and the colors are bright and appropriate, and the expressions are lifelike, and it is no different from the living at first glance. It can be said that it is unique in the embroidery industry.</p>
<p>Uses of Embroidery Products Since there are so many types of embroidery products as mentioned above, the most widely used is Suzhou embroidery, because its products are finely stitched and suitable for tailoring quilt covers, tablecloths, embroidered pillows, embroidered cushions, and other brocade embroidery clothing materials. The items are both gorgeous and practical, and the sales are quite wide. As for other embroidered items, they are generally fine art decorations, mainly featuring famous paintings and calligraphy, landscapes, and figures, followed by curtains, table skirts, and seat cushions. Except for Xiang embroidery and brocade embroidery, each has its own special advantages, and the sales are smooth. The rest are mediocre, and they are not as good as Suzhou embroidery.</p>
<p>Market Price of Embroidery Products Since embroidery is one of the art crafts, its price is not fixed, which is by no means comparable to machine-made products. The embroidery work is slow, and the output is not much, so it is often one to several times higher than machine-made products. In addition to the above-mentioned reasons, embroidery also depends on the quality of the satin material, the size of the embroidery piece, the complexity of the pattern, and the density of the needlework. According to the industry's heyday, calculated by fixed pieces, it was as high as thousands of hundreds of yuan, medium to three or five hundred yuan, and less than one hundred yuan or so. Ordinary finished products range from three or several yuan to several hundred yuan. However, in recent years, times have changed, the business has declined miserably, and the market price has fallen sharply, at least 30% to 40% less than in the past. As for the wholesale selection of embroidery products, the wholesale price is particularly cheap, and the transaction can be concluded at about 50% off the listed price. It is said that the profit is still very rich, because the embroidery work is cheap (from three or four corners to hundreds of yuan per piece), and the cost is relatively small, which is not easy for non-industry people to see clearly. It is said that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, this port's Jinhua Yao Xiang Embroidery Shop undertook to embroider a photo of US President Hoover, about three inches square, and the plain price was 1,000 yuan in national currency, which was still considered cheap. Later, it won an art award from the Chicago Exposition in the United States to show its appreciation.</p>
<p>Silk woven brocade embroidery is made by machines, the output is fast, the output is large, and it can be increased or decreased at any time according to market needs. The price of the products, whether they are custom-made or spot goods, is calculated according to the size and complexity of the structure (but the custom-made ones are subject to a plate-making fee). The price starts from 3 corners for 3×4 inches to 80 yuan for 39×80 inches, and there will be no increase or decrease in the future, which is more than twice as cheap as embroidery, so the business is quite developed, and it is by no means fluke to be able to keep pace with embroidery products. In recent years, affected by the economic depression, the purchasing power is weak, and the business has plummeted. If there are wholesale transactions, it is willing to sell at 50% off the listed price. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e182">Smuggling and Reporting by the Same Industry <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>National goods and smuggling stand in irreconcilable positions. With smuggling, there are no national goods. To protect national goods is to eliminate smuggling. There is nothing in life that cannot be done, no industry that cannot be engaged in, no place where money cannot be made, but one must engage in this smuggling life. These are either people who do not know human shame or madmen.</p>
<p>Eliminating smuggling and using secret reports is indeed very effective. But the most effective method is to borrow the power of the same industry association and give it full power to inspect and report. Then, all industries will be under martial law, and they will supervise each other. The trend of smuggling may be curbed. Therefore, the most important method is to strengthen the organization of the same industry association, so that each industry association has real strength and a consistent attitude to deal with smugglers. The call for amending the same industry association laws is now a nationwide trend. Reforming the laissez-faire doctrine and replacing it with interventionism is the key element of amending this law. Mr. Hu Xiyuan's proposal to organize an industrial association and a chamber of commerce as legitimate groups of industry and commerce is also to strengthen the power of industrial groups. The fundamental solution is indeed a unique view. It is heard that various groups are assigning members to study in order to submit a memorial to the central government for adoption and implementation. Recently, the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association, the Silk and Satin Industry Association, and the Rayon Industry Association jointly decided that rayon packages in each factory must be affixed with stamps. If not, they will be regarded as smuggled goods. It is heard that everyone has unanimously agreed. If each industry association has this kind of control power, then smuggling is not to be feared.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Extraordinary Times and Saving the Country with National Goods <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Recently, economic experts and political figures often publish financial fallacies in extraordinary times, emergency financial measures, and planned financial management. They are eloquent and indeed, the country is in a very dangerous environment! Experts' theories are not only eloquent, but also plans that should be in place in extraordinary times. Let's take a look at the smuggling problem in the North, which is already extremely serious! According to reports, the Tianjin Customs statistics show that the customs and tax cards of the Great Wall collected a total of 41 million yuan in taxes last year. This year, due to the impact of smuggling, the reduction reached as much as 20 million yuan! Although the export tax increased by several hundred thousand yuan, it is far from enough to offset it. And someone pointed out that our Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Zhifu customs armed gunboats were cracking down on smuggling in the Bohai Bay, accusing us of invading public territorial waters and protesting to us... Their unreasonable demands, the evil forces of economic aggression; the conspiracy to dominate our country's entire finances; and the complex background of serious smuggling have all been clearly revealed!</p>
<p>From extraordinary times, I also thought of saving the country with national goods. Chinese people using Chinese goods is a matter of course. No matter how cheap a certain product is! Especially smuggled goods! We must not pay attention to it, and we must not be tempted! We must know that the country can only use national goods for one day if it survives. If the country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, our clothing, food, and supplies will be controlled by the enemy. If we want to buy national goods with all our heart and want to save the country with all our heart, it may be too late! Therefore, I say that the arrival of extraordinary times is the day when the Chinese people unite and step up the implementation of "saving the country with national goods"! We must not neglect it for a moment!</p>
<h3 id="e184">A Record of Visiting the China Educational Supplies Factory <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, it was very hot. We took the opportunity of the week to visit our teacher, Mr. Ling Wenzhi, on Kunming Road, and by the way, we visited the China Educational Supplies Factory where he works. Although it was about to snow, we didn't feel cold at all.</p>
<p>The factory is divided into three major workshops: the first workshop is divided into five departments: metalworking, woodworking, painting, electroplating, and assembly. Inside, they probably manufacture scientific instruments and other supplies. Many schools use them and all agree that they are satisfactory. In the past, all kinds of instruments relied on imported goods, but now most of them can be replaced by domestic products.</p>
<p>The second workshop is for making globes, human models, specimens, and microscope slides. Mr. Ling said, "The workers here not only have to work hard, but also have 'talent' and training. It often takes several weeks to complete a specimen. For example, the fish anatomy model, the first step is to carefully dissect it, and the second step is to understand the fish's organization and explain it clearly. Many people who lack this kind of 'talent' will never succeed. A fish is not expensive, but after dissection, it will cost a lot of money." Many people who make human models use thick cardboard to make human shapes, big and small, male and female, which is very interesting. Making this work also requires several steps. Some parts are made of thick paper, and some parts are made of plaster. After assembling, the colors must be painted. The workers must understand the human physiological organization. We also went to the microscope slide department and saw many glass slides with various shapes of germs inside. These peculiar tools will integrate "learning" and "facts", and the function is very great. The preparation of specimens can be divided into four parts: soaking, drying, skeletons, and peeling. After watching for a while, we went to the third workshop.</p>
<p>This workshop only makes monthly, daily, weekly, and hourly clocks. China is still the first manufacturer. With this clock, you only need to turn the spring, and it will automatically report the date and time. For example, on the day we visited, the left corner of the clock was marked with the month, day, and day of the week. This clock has many conveniences. There are five procedures for making clocks: the first part is to make a sample. After the sample is made, the metalworking department doubles the metal products according to the sample, such as gears, shafts, needles, and other parts. The third is the mold-making department, which makes the outline of the clock, and then sends it to the installation department for installation. After the installation is completed, the factory will also test it in the testing department to ensure its accuracy. In this way, the clock is completed. Except for springs and other things that China absolutely does not produce, most of the rest are made of domestic products, so that money will not flow to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Ling invited us to the showroom, where various products are displayed, from kindergarten to university, all very complete. To the east of the factory is a botanical and zoological garden for cultivating the factory's use in making specimens. Recently, it will pay attention to three items: scout supplies, children's toys, and economic instruments. All products of the factory are sold by the Zhonghua Book Company, and the total turnover is more than 500,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Finally, we were very grateful to Mr. Ling for his warm reception. This visit increased our knowledge a lot and we were extremely satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Lu Zhongwen and Ye Liang Invented a Rotary Three-Way Light Bulb <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>This is certainly a gratifying thing. After the prelude to 1936 unfolded, we heard about people inventing things one after another. Who said that the Chinese have no inventing power? Now everyone doesn't believe it. Recently, we learned that in Nanhui, not far from Shanghai, two young people, Lu Zhongwen and Ye Liang, invented a rotary three-way light bulb. This is certainly good news in the promotion of national goods!</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese people have set up factories to manufacture light bulbs themselves. There are also many so-called domestic light bulbs. However, most of the products are rough and cannot compete with imported goods. So what is the result? Until now, the light bulb business is still monopolized by foreign manufacturers. Now, Lu and Ye have invented a rotary three-way light bulb, and we deeply hope that it can defeat foreign light bulbs and make them disappear from the Chinese market.</p>
<p>It is said that this rotary three-way light bulb is divided into two types, A and B. Type A has three tungsten filaments of different brightness, manufactured in one light bulb, such as 50 watts, 25 watts, and 5 watts. If you need any light, you only need to rotate the outer ring above the bulb head slightly to change it. Moreover, when one brightness is lit, the other two tungsten filaments are completely off, so use a small light when there is nothing to do, a medium light when working, and a large light for banquets. One light bulb has three changes, and it is extraordinarily convenient to change it as you like.</p>
<p>Type B is a light bulb with three tungsten filaments of the same brightness. In this way, after your light bulb burns out one after a period of time, you can use the remaining two. You only need to rotate it until all three tungsten filaments are completely burned out before it becomes waste.</p>
<p>Therefore, in fact, types A and B light bulbs, although they are one light bulb, have three light bulb uses, and this three-way light bulb saves electricity, is easy to use, and will never explode or bump. The bulb head can automatically turn on and off. You only need to rotate the bulb slightly to turn it on or off. There is no need to use a separate switch. The chrome-plated appearance is also very beautiful. Therefore, once it is shipped in the future, it is very suitable for shops, schools, and public and private institutions.</p>
<p>Lu Zhongwen and Ye Liang are both graduates of the Municipal People's Livelihood Middle School. After leaving school, they worked for an electrical appliance company, so they have a good understanding of electrical appliances. This was invented after more than a year of research. Now the Ministry of Industry has expressed its commendation and has granted a special patent for five years. Lu and Ye are also actively preparing and widely soliciting shares, and the establishment of a factory is not far away.</p>
<p>It is said that the opening of this light bulb factory requires a capital of at least 20,000 yuan. Only half of it has been raised. Once the capital is sufficient, it will start manufacturing. If the shares can be raised to 100,000 yuan or 80,000 yuan, then it can be manufactured on a large scale. Their factory name has been determined as "Central Three-Way Light Bulb Factory", and the factory site is planned to be selected in the Xiaoshadu area. All preparations are being actively carried out. It is deeply hoped that domestic capitalists will actively invest so that the careers of these two young people can be successful one day.</p>
<p>Communication</p>
<h3 id="e186">Mr. Jiang Yunshan Talks About National Goods in the Japanese Market <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Youwen</p>
<p>In the middle of last month, I went to Tokyo for private affairs. I was invited by Mr. Jiang Yunshan to have lunch at Meguro Gajoen. Mr. Jiang has been in the East for many years and works in the Chinese restaurant of the garden. During the banquet, he told me the crux of why national goods cannot be sold well in Japan, and he was deeply saddened! I specially recorded Mr. Jiang's conversation to fill this publication, hoping that all readers will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Reporter: Mr. Jiang, you must be very familiar with the trade situation of our national goods in the Japanese market, right?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang: In the past, Japanese people often held special excellent concepts about our country's goods. This concept arose from the abundance of our country's products! On the one hand, the durability of the goods and the cheapness of the goods drove their procurement goals, thinking that Chinese goods were more noble than European and American products. Therefore, business trade was not stagnant. What is most noteworthy is that many Japanese people who like to drink tea and wine feel unnatural without a pot of Chinese wine and Chinese tea at the table. National goods also occupied a considerable position in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>Reporter: In this way, our country's goods are so popular in Japan, and the sales must be wide. Why has the amount of exports to Japan been decreasing day by day in recent years, resulting in the lifelessness that is currently dying?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang: Those who engage in international trade are disorganized and lack control, and the government also lacks advisers, allowing them to run rampant. You must know that engaging in international trade is not comparable to domestic transactions, and the procedures are not so simple. The most important principles of businessmen are credibility and integrity. The credibility and integrity of international traders also represent the credibility and integrity of the entire country's trade! The reason why our country's goods were popular with the Japanese in the past was because they were so-called cheap and good. In recent years, because businessmen have been greedy for small profits, they have turned the goods upside down. In this way, credibility has been lost. Even if it is a real beauty, who will believe it? In the past, there were many Chinese goods in Gajoen. Those Japanese people only needed Chinese goods, and they did not care about the high price. Therefore, sales increased layer by layer, and Chinese goods in Gajoen were also pushed to the highest position. Now, the credibility of businessmen has been lost, and the position and credibility of the country's foreign trade have also been shaken! In Gajoen, no one cares about our country's goods anymore. The market is piled up in the corner. Even the business of the shops set up by overseas Chinese has suffered a setback!</p>
<p>Reporter: So, is the reason why our country's goods cannot occupy a considerable position in the Japanese market entirely due to the corruption and inferiority of businessmen's personalities?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang: Isn't that right? I recall that when I first came to Japan, the most popular items in the Chinese restaurant of Gajoen were Huangjiu and Green Bean Shao, which were shipped from Shanghai. At that time, the Japanese aristocratic class, when they came to Gajoen, had to drink heavily to show their wealth. It can be imagined how high the price of wine was and how much the Japanese loved it! Later, businessmen wanted to make huge profits, so they diluted the wine with other kinds of water and mixed fish eyes with pearls, and raised the price, which led to a loss of credibility! Now, they have replaced it with famous European and American wines. It's the same here, and it's probably the same elsewhere! The breakdown of businessmen's personalities is the biggest blow to the country's foreign trade!</p>
<p>Reporter: I heard that the Japanese are paying attention to the raw materials and manufacturing methods of our country's products that are dumped to them everywhere. They are actively trying to imitate them, and mass-produce them to lower prices, so as to invisibly resist the dumping of our country's goods. Mr. Jiang, you have been in Japan for many years, and you must be very familiar with this, right?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang: The fierce competition between the Japanese and our country's goods has indeed become irreconcilable.</p>

<h3 id="e188">World Games Track and Field Team Begins Training Today <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Yue Lun Addresses Team Yesterday, Fu Bao, Lu Wang, and He to Test Pole Vault on the 16th</p>
<p>The 15 members of the Chinese track and field team participating in the World Games, were announced the night before last.  Regarding the pole vault event, the Track and Field Selection Committee has designated Fu Bao, Lu Wang, and He to test their results next Tuesday (the 16th) to select one person.  Yesterday at 5 PM, Mr. John Ma gathered the representatives at the De Lin Apartments to give a speech.  Liu Changchun was selected as the team captain on the spot, and Zhang Lingjia was selected as the liaison officer during the training period.  The Chinese track and field team was officially established.</p>
<p>Team Members in Attendance</p>
<p>Those present at yesterday's meeting included Track and Field Selection Committee member Ma Yue Lun, team members Jian Changchun, Wang Shilin, Wang Zhengling, Chen Baoqiu, Guo Jie, Zhang Lingjia, Jia Lianren, Leng Peigen, Lin Shaozhou, Wu Bixian, Dai Shuguo, Huang Yingjie, Li Sen, and 13 others. Fu Jincheng and Cheng Jinguan were absent due to other engagements. Shen Kunnan, a coach, was also present.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma's Address</p>
<p>Around 5 PM, the team members arrived one after another. Mr. John Ma stood up and gave an address, briefly stating that all representatives of China attending the World Games should demonstrate the spirit of the Chinese nation. Since you all represent the country and the people, you must pay attention to your words, attitude, actions, clothing, and all details, and not take them lightly, so that various countries will have a good image of you in the international arena. During the training period, each representative must not be complacent because they have been selected, but must continue to work hard, break records, and improve their performance. Discipline should be strictly observed to avoid criticism from public opinion.</p>
<p>Reported Matters</p>
<p>After Mr. Ma finished his address, he made the following report: Training will begin on the 11th for a period of two weeks, from 4 PM to 6 PM, at Shen Garden. The training rules will be drafted by myself (Mr. Ma referred to himself), and after consulting with Mr. Song Junfu, the representatives will be notified. Tests will be conducted once a week. During the training period, you must return to your residence for rest after lunch every day, and are not allowed to go out before training. You must be in bed by 10 PM. During the training period, each person will receive a daily allowance of one dollar and 25 cents for meals and one dollar for miscellaneous expenses. During the training period, small-scale confrontations with various strong teams in the city will be arranged to increase competitive experience. The Association can handle leave matters for each representative's service unit and school. Passport photos can be taken at Wang's Photo Studio, and uniforms will be made by Wu Xingchang. All representatives will reside in the De Lin Apartments.</p>
<p>Election of Team Captain</p>
<p>After the report, Liu Changchun was elected as the team captain on the spot.  Upon Mr. Liu's proposal, a liaison officer was chosen for the training period, and Zhang Lingjia was elected.  Then, forms were filled out to obtain passports, and commemorative badges for the pre-selection confrontation, donated by the Association, were distributed.  The meeting adjourned around 6 PM.  After the meeting, the representatives went to have their uniforms made.  It is said that the training instructors are Ma Yue Lun, Song Junfu, Shen Kunnan, Xia Xiang, and Shu Hong.</p>
<p>Training Methods</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ma, the training method will adopt individual training. Each day, group exercises will be done first to warm up the body, and then each person will practice their own event. I will be present at each individual training session to instruct the athletes on all postures and methods, and I will ask Song Junfu and Xia Xiang, the track and field team managers, to assist. Regarding the training policy, I advocate the inductive method, to enlighten and encourage each athlete's talent and ability to make progress, so that they can easily exert their inherent potential. I do not advocate the oppressive method. Mr. Ma finally said that the selection was increased from 12 to 16 people purely to send more representatives to observe sports, so that they would have more opportunities to seek future development. Regarding funding, efforts will still be made to raise it.</p>

<p>— Written and Sent by Li Huitang</p>
<p>Moving to Bandung</p>
<p>On May 18th at 10 AM, our entire team took the train to Bandung. Huitang and Dr. Rong stayed behind to handle public and private matters, and then took a car with friends at 3 PM, arriving in the evening. Bandung is a small city in the middle of densely packed mountains, about 160 kilometers from Batavia. It is known as the "Little Paris of the East." The weather is spring-like all year round, making it a very suitable place to live. I heard that after our team arrived, they were warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese community. In the afternoon, a general meeting was held, and Coach Yan gave a speech to express his gratitude. Our team is staying at the "Hequn" Hotel Union. After being in the hot and depressing Batavia, everyone felt comfortable and happy in the cool Bandung. However, the water there is particularly cold, and most people dare not bathe after dusk. Even if they do, they shiver and tremble in the tropical region of Southeast Asia, daring not to take a cold bath. Those who do not know the reason will definitely find it strange. In fact, there are many small cities in Southeast Asia located in valleys thousands of feet above sea level, which are most suitable for escaping the heat and recuperating. The weather is very similar to the cool autumn of our country. It is not surprising that people dare not take cold baths. After a good night's sleep, even a single blanket is not warm enough. On the 19th, we made contact with the Bandung selection team. Because they have the advantage of the terrain, they are known as the "local snakes." We ended up with a tie after a hard fight.</p>
<p>Record of the Bandung Match</p>
<p>May 19th was the date of our team's second match in Java. The opponent was the Bandung selection team, which had lost to the Batavia selection team by a score of 3 to 1 in the inter-city competition last week. We arrived at the stadium at 4 PM. First, the Party anthem and the Dutch national anthem were played, and then the Minister of the Army performed the opening ceremony. The result was a 2-2 tie. Huitang and Jiang Bai each scored one goal. Our lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>After the start of the match, our team launched wave after wave of attacks, but retreated again and again due to offside. The opponent's skills were extremely rough, but they were good at sprinting and using long passes to advance. Our defense was repeatedly trapped, and the field was uneven and the ground was as hard as iron, making the ball difficult to control. As a result, the opponent took advantage of the terrain and gained the upper hand. After 25 minutes, the opponent's goalkeeper committed a foul, and Huitang scored a penalty kick. Before long, our defense was slightly negligent, and the enemy center forward retaliated. The first half ended in a draw. After the break, we responded with a new formation.</p>
<p>Not long after taking the field, our team launched several fierce attacks, but they were all saved by their goalkeeper. After attacking for a long time without success, there was bound to be a mistake. Sure enough, after 15 minutes, the enemy had a sharp forward who seized the opportunity to score a goal. Our team first won and then drew, and then almost lost. With little time left, we poured all our strength into offense, transferring Jiang Bai to the front line to assist in the attack, adopting a "do or die" strategy. Unfortunately, the ball often bounced erratically, and although there were many opportunities, we often missed at the last moment. With only five minutes left before the end of the match, in the midst of dwindling hope, Jiang Bai finally managed to create a tie. Then, Bei Hua headed in a goal, but it was ruled out of bounds by the referee and did not count. The final whistle blew, and the match ended in a 2-2 tie. According to reports, although our team lost many opportunities that day due to unfamiliarity with the field and the inability to control the ball, the entire team was unusually disorganized, and the performance was lackluster. There was no way to deny it. The audience was dissatisfied, which was not surprising. After the match, the Minister of the Army awarded two silver cups, and Mr. Chen Baoshan, Huitang's childhood teacher, presented an embroidered flag on behalf of the Confucian group. Huitang accepted them separately, expressed his gratitude, and the crowd dispersed with cheers.</p>

<h3 id="e198">National Language Council Broadcast: Phonetic Symbols Class Starts Today <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>School Teachers, Normal Students, and Others Are Required to Attend, Divided into Elementary, Middle, and Advanced Levels, the Course Lasts Nine Weeks</p>
<p>The National Mandarin Education Promotion Association, in order to comply with the Ministry of Education's order to implement phonetic Chinese characters on July 1st of this year, and to stipulate that elementary schools and public schools first teach phonetic symbols, has specially opened a phonetic symbol broadcast training class, in order to train a large number of teachers. It has been launched in Shanghai first. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has issued a notice to all municipal and private elementary school Chinese teachers, public literacy school teachers, and normal school students to participate in the study. The association has been lecturing at the Shanghai Buddhist Sound Radio Station starting at 4:15 PM on June 8th. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Course Arrangement</p>
<p>The association divides phonetic symbols into elementary, middle, and advanced levels, and compiles a textbook for each level. The training period is a total of nine weeks. The elementary course focuses on basic practice of initials, finals, combined finals, and tones, lasting two weeks. The intermediate course focuses on pinyin practice and tone practice, lasting three weeks. This session has been shortened because it is too close to the summer vacation, and has been changed to two weeks, but the time for each session will be extended by 15 minutes to make up for the original time. The advanced course focuses on the pronunciation of retroflex finals, changes in tones, and flexible use of phonetics, lasting four weeks. The advanced level will not be offered temporarily this year. Because the advanced course must reach a considerable level of ability in the elementary and middle courses before proceeding to the advanced course, otherwise "it will be like trying to draw a tiger but ending up with something resembling a dog."</p>
<p>Class Starts Today</p>
<p>The association first explained the broadcasting situation, listening and learning attention, and sound checks in detail for the past two days. The formal elementary course is scheduled to start at 4:15 PM today, starting from scratch according to the elementary phonetic symbol textbook. Ma Guoying will be the lecturer. Listeners can follow the book to learn on time. It is reported that the organizers of the association said that the courses at all levels are very heavy, and the lecture time is very short, so they hope that the listeners will listen on time every day and do not interrupt or be absent. A very short practice time is reserved during the lecture time. It is hoped that the listeners will take the opportunity to follow along and practice. If you only use your ears to listen and not your mouth to learn, it will be difficult to improve your skills and methods. After listening to the lecture every day, you must take some time to practice fully. If listeners have any questions, they can send them directly to the Buddhist Sound Radio Station, 418 Hede Road, Shanghai, so that they can be answered.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Office of the Chinese Economic Society to Hold a Meeting in Shanghai in Late September</p>
<p>The Chinese Economic Society is the earliest established academic economic organization in China. Since its establishment in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, there have been branches and offices, and the number of members has reached more than 800. Since the election of Li Zhaohuan and Ma Yinchu as president and vice president, they have made unremitting efforts to carry out the affairs of the society. In addition to the Nanjing and Guangzhou branches, which have been established one after another, it has also been decided that the annual meeting of this session will be held in Shanghai in late September, which will be prepared by the Shanghai branch. A meeting was held a few days ago to discuss all the ongoing matters. Pan Lun was appointed as the director-general, Zhou Zhongqian as the deputy director-general, Wu Xiaoyuan and Zhang Sichuan as the general affairs group officer, Cao Lishun as the documents group officer, Zhou Zhongqian and Li Yunliang as the reception group officers, Li Zhaohuan and Tang Qingzeng as the thesis group officers, and Ma Yinchu and Jin Guobao as the debate group officers. It is also heard that the scope of the thesis for this session has been set as "Economic Issues in Extraordinary Times" and "Financial Issues in Extraordinary Times," which will be communicated to all societies to prepare. In addition to the thesis, another special feature of this annual meeting is the holding of academic debates. The topic "Should China seek internal price stability or foreign exchange stability in implementing the new financial policy?" has been selected. Members of the Shanghai and Nanjing branches will separately determine the pros and cons, and each will compile two groups, each group consisting of three debaters and one reserve member. The selection of debate members is currently underway in the two branches. At that time, the battle of words will surely be a great discussion.</p>

<p>Chen Lijian, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, spoke on "Active Social Education" on the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 7th. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The Meaning of Social Education</p>
<p>What is social education? To this day, there is no universally accepted definition. There are also many similar terms, such as mass education, adult education, popular education, extended education, remedial education, and people's education, which are often used interchangeably, making the situation very complicated. This lack of uniformity, in the eyes of a few, leads to varied discussions and tricks. In fact, this non-standardized situation is precisely the vitality and hope of social education. Why? We must know that the history of social education is very short. Its emergence is only in the last decade or so. The addition of the Department of Social Education to the Ministry of Education in our country began in the first year of the Republic of China. It is a new undertaking, and traditional education cannot help it much. It is still evolving and cannot be stereotyped or standardized. It is a newborn baby with infinite future. It is the newly rising sun, and its contribution to mankind is unpredictable. British adult education expert Peffer said, "To give an accurate definition of adult education, it is best to wait until the adult education undertaking is more developed, because only when the undertaking is developed can we determine the nature based on the facts." This is very true. During this ongoing period, defining social education is naturally not an easy task. However, for the sake of defining the scope of work and pointing out the goals of efforts, it seems best to have a definition. Based on this idea, I will give a temporary definition of social education.</p>
<p>In my opinion, "Social education is education outside of school, or non-formal education outside of the formal school system." This seems extremely simple, but it seems acceptable for temporary application. Why do I say that social education is education outside of school? This can be explained by the matters currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education in our country. The Department of Social Education is divided into two sections:</p>
<p>The first section is in charge of the following matters: Matters concerning mass education; Matters concerning phonetic symbols and literacy movements; Matters concerning popular reading materials; Matters concerning popular lectures; Matters concerning remedial education; Matters concerning special education for the disabled and other disabilities; Matters concerning national calendars; Matters concerning the Ministry's library.</p>
<p>The second section is in charge of the following matters: Matters concerning mass education centers; Matters concerning museums; Matters concerning libraries; Matters concerning the preservation of documents and antiquities; Matters concerning beautification education; Matters concerning the improvement of customs and popular entertainment (parks, dramas, movies, folk songs, customs, etc.); Matters concerning public sports; Matters concerning the Central Education Center. These were the regulations a few years ago. Recently, educational broadcasting, film education, labor education, and special education have also been under the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Education.</p>
<p>After looking at the matters listed above, we can understand that these educational undertakings are all things that formal school education does not have time for. For example, taking the first item of the first section, matters concerning mass education, the number of uneducated adult citizens in our country accounts for 80% of the national population. However, formal schools do not provide an opportunity for older, uneducated citizens to receive supplementary education. Our school system does not include education for older, uneducated citizens. All of the items listed above are very important and must be done. Now that schools do not pay attention to them, we naturally have to find other ways outside of school. This kind of educational facility outside of school is social education. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Sellers Seize the Opportunity to Act: Resulting in Only Seventy Cents</p>
<p>The gold market was quite brisk yesterday due to the surge in pure gold. Unexpectedly, after the sellers seized the opportunity to act at high prices, the buyers suddenly became onlookers. Banks also held back and gradually lowered prices. In the end, it was still stable. In the early morning, overseas silver markets showed that London rose and the US was flat. The forward silver price in Montelieu fell by eight mils and rose by one cent. Exchange rates uniformly contracted. London raw gold rose by seven pence. The off-market tentative transaction opened higher at forty-four yuan. Although Fuxingyong made advances, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Yuanfengyong, and others unloaded, retreating to two and a half yuan. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both the UK and the US flat. The customs gold unit rose by seven mils. The standard call loan price was posted higher at 1,133 yuan. The morning opening was still high. After the opening, the market was still stable, but due to pressure from major players taking advantage of high prices, selling pressure gradually increased, gradually moving downstream. The HSBC's posted rates were announced, with both the UK and the US flat, and the silver equalization tax was announced to have risen by 25. At this time, supply and demand were stable, and it hovered around 42 yuan. However, there was an eagerness among sellers, and it finally broke below the 40 yuan mark. Therefore, short sellers took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions. At noon, the trend was stable. The after-market gradually stabilized, and major players purchased actively. After the opening, it gradually recovered. However, because of the profit-taking at high prices, banks still supplied a lot. In the end, it was peaceful. The market conditions for today are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1,142.70 yuan, an increase of 2.40 yuan compared to the previous close. Chunyuan Yongda and Fayong Dingkang advanced to three yuan. Dadecheng, Hengchangyong, Fuxingyong, Chunyuan Yongyuan, Maoyong Dingkang Yingxiang sold off, falling to 1.30 yuan. The HSBC's posted rates were announced, with both the UK and the US flat. Dadecheng fluctuated, and the silver equalization tax rose by 25. At this time, it hovered around one yuan for quite a long time. Tongtaichang Hengyu Dadecheng Yuanfengyong Qiafengyong Qianchangxiang Yuanmaoyong Tongfu and others sold off, falling from two yuan to 39.70 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Fuxingyong Yuanchangyong Futaiheng Yuqingyong took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, rising to 0.80 yuan. The afternoon close was 1,140.70 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 1,140.90 yuan. Dafayong Yuanmaoyong covered their positions, rising to 1.10 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Yuanchangyong Daheng Yuanfengyong Dadecheng purchased positions, so Dadecheng Fuxingyong, although selling at 0.60 yuan, soon recovered to 1.80 yuan. Fuchunyong Qiafengyong Honglilai advanced, rising to 1.80 yuan. Futaiheng Yuanmaoyong still sold off at high prices, and the closing retreated to 1,141 yuan. The market was slightly weak after the close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard call loan price, was posted higher at 1,133 yuan, approximately 8 yuan higher than the closing price, and 4 yuan less than the previous close.

Since then, banks have slightly traded against each other and been mediocre, and the same was true at noon. In the after-market, banks differed on whether to plug the gap. Chinese merchants still came to settle US dollars, but because banks took advantage of the high prices to plug the gap, the buying interest was suppressed and it was difficult to revive.

The closing selling prices for near-term were one shilling, two pence, and three-seven-five for the British pound, and twenty-nine yuan and nine-three-seven-five for the US dollar, the decrease by British was flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.0625 compared to the previous close.

<p>The Selling Pressure Grows Stronger - Market Prices Plunge by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions at the Chinese Securities Exchange were due to rumors in the Southwest, which have been clearly published in various newspapers. Rumors from Hunan Province followed, and the selling pressure from various groups became increasingly strong. The long positions' defenses showed signs of wavering. Only because there were too many short sellers in the market, and the number of those covering their positions was also large, market prices plunged severely, which was rare in recent months. If the interest is removed, the prices of types B, C, D, and E have actually broken the lowest prices of February 28th. At present, changes in the environment depend on the decisions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. On the surface, the outflows of spot goods in recent days have put pressure on the long positions. If there is no turnaround in the political situation, the long positions will have no room to maneuver. With rumors intertwined, can this crisis be resolved on the eve of this critical moment of fortune and misfortune? It is not only the public debt market that is greatly affected. Yesterday's progress was that the opening market was the weakest, and the decline was fierce. Numbers 16, 43, and 47 were the main forces on the selling side, and retail investors also sold off one after another, with sharp declines of 0.35 to 0.80 yuan. In the second session, types D and E recovered by 0.10 to 0.30 yuan, but it still seemed to be the old trick of a large decline followed by a small recovery. However, the downward trend could not be reversed in the end, as a large number of sales suddenly occurred in number 48. The subsequent listings were still slightly lower by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. At the afternoon opening, long positions in numbers 10, 47, and 48, etc., were broken down, and the outflow of spot goods was continuous. Type E fell by another half a yuan, and type D fell by 0.65 yuan, and the market was still weak. Although the closing trend was relatively moderate, the decline did not stop. According to the trend, there is a possibility of continued decline. However, if the selling pressure on the surface eases slightly, a recovery is also easy. However, the overall trend should still depend on the political situation for a turnaround. The result of yesterday's market prices was a unanimous sharp decline, ranging from 0.85 to 1.25 yuan. 96 was also slightly lower by 0.70 yuan. The total number of transactions was 10.47 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, and the situation remains within a fluctuating pattern. Although most retail investors are covered by a bad atmosphere and mostly sell off with a bearish outlook, the Sichuan, Hunan, and Yunnan gangs are uniquely strong in purchasing native yarn, so people's hearts are stable.

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the market situation remains within a fluctuating pattern. The overseas cotton industry situation is still firm.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with bad news from Liverpool. There was rain in the East, but the amount of long covering and arbitrage was absorbed by traders and Japanese merchants. Therefore, the opening market prices fell by 2 pounds to rise by 3 pounds. The sales of textiles were smooth, and the cotton market was strong.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still peaceful. It was difficult to suppress the exchange rate of Austrian and Shantou currency. Business in the South has disappeared, and gangs from Sichuan and Yunnan are also hesitant. The sales channels have suddenly become weak. Among printed cotton flannel, the earliest and most popular was the Donghua Jilong brand. In recent years, domestic goods have made rapid progress. Last year, the sales of various factories reached more than 20,000 boxes. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs were the earliest to purchase. Since the opening of the factory prices of Hengfeng and Guangzhong factories last week, there have been continued purchases. Yesterday, the 11-pound Jincheng brand natural bleached cloth from Yong'an Factory opened at 6.8 yuan, and the 9-pound Jincheng opened at 6 yuan, which was inventory from the previous year.</p>
<p>Other factories have not yet launched new products due to the early season. Hunan gangs still sent telegrams adding white plain cloth and colored crepe de chine of 50 to 60 pieces, which all need to be shipped quickly. The Zhejiang route is also purchasing plain cloth and crepe de chine. Dye factories on this street are still keen on purchasing Donghua plain cloth. Nearly 100 pieces were traded yesterday. The market price has been raised by 0.025 to 0.075 yuan per piece compared to last week. After the price increase of Qiahe coarse cloth, the market atmosphere has improved.

Gilman, Siemssen &amp; Co., Ewo, and other Russian firms also rushed to procure supplies, leading to a slight revitalization of the market. The market price also improved due to the firm stance of Chinese merchants. The green tea market, however, was slightly sluggish. The sales of Chun Mee tea were significantly reduced compared to previous periods. Yesterday, there were some transactions of Tunxi Chun Mee by Gilman and Dodwell, priced from 86 yuan to 93 yuan. There were also few transactions of other grades. However, for Pingshui Gunpowder tea, Bowron &amp; Co. purchased 500 packages at a price of 53 or 54 yuan, similar to previous prices.

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, various months initially showed a chaotic pattern, with prices fluctuating in both directions. Later, prices fell due to improved weather. At the opening, prices were quoted based on foreign wheat, with Chicago wheat quoted at 4/8ths different, and Canadian wheat quoted at 2/3ths different. In June, large speculators mostly sold off their positions, and market sentiment did not appear tense. For deferred months, however, sentiment remained good due to the continued rainfall, and speculators engaged in short covering. Therefore, months from September onwards were generally one fen better than the previous day. Later, as the number of buyers did not increase, prices fell by more than one fen from the initial opening. When the market opened in the afternoon, the weather gradually improved, and many outside speculators sold off their positions. Prices for various months then fell slightly again. Looking at the current situation, while half is related to the weather, the key issue in the future is that if sales are not strong and factories have ample inventory, then changes will be inevitable.</p>

<p>New Wheat Factory Opens with 1,300 Packages</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening bell in the morning, the various months still showed a calm picture. Prices were quoted based on foreign wheat, continuing to be 4/8ths to 2/3ths different, but as the weather was still slightly rainy, there were still concerns in the market. Therefore, trading across the various months was generally hovering, and inflows and outflows were not seen to be smooth. Only the current month was slightly up by 3/4ths of a fen, while the rest remained unchanged. When the market opened in the afternoon, the weather had improved, and flour prices had softened, so the mentality of industry participants was uniformly weak. Opening prices fell by as much as 5/6ths of a fen. June, because of the sharp rise the previous day, fell even more sharply, dropping a dime between the morning and afternoon. The other months fell by as much as 4/5/6ths of a fen. New wheat from various locations has reportedly already been about half harvested. If the weather remains sunny and good going forward, then arrivals will gradually increase, and formal transactions will be possible. Also, yesterday 100 packages of Nanjing new wheat opened at 4 yuan and 5 fen, and 1,100 packages of Shandong Yaowan wheat at 4 yuan and 5 jiao, purchased by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs were even scarcer, with only arrivals on the 11th and 12th, totaling over 2,000 piculs. However, customer sales were sluggish, and only the Dalian gang purchased 500+ packages of Gao Bao thin rice. Therefore, the prices of thick粳 early rice and thin rice are still difficult to increase. Fortunately, arrivals are still scarce, and market sentiment is slightly stabilized, so the situation seems to be stabilizing. If sales once become strong, there may be hope for an upturn. Arrivals and sales of Duyang tip rice are similar, with no distinction.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various routes downstream were on the 17th and 18th. Sales of white 粳 rice in the market continued to improve, and the market situation was hovering. Arrivals of thin rice and early 粳 were few, and sales were still acceptable, with prices stable. Shade-grown Yuan rice was scarce and sold well, with prices increasing by nearly one jiao. Sales of White Yuan were active, and the market situation was high and stable, with medium and secondary grades slightly tighter by a few fen. The prices of various 秈 and other goods were similar to the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, customer 秈 rice had some arrivals in Shanghai, but sales were sluggish, and the market turned flat and soft again. Because the inland market had already stalled yesterday, the Quanzhou gang did not continue purchasing. Also, rumors arose in the market, and market sentiment was uneasy. Fortunately, the local gang's sales were still fragrant, and the Xiamen gang was inquiring early and late, so market prices were still able to hold. 5,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, 300 packages of Hunan rice, 260 packages of Taiwan rice, and 100 packages of small milled rice were released throughout the day. Except for Jiangxi rice, which was sold to Xiamen, all other sales were done by the local gang.</p>

The goods were better in body color and seed quality compared to previous batches, with prices opening at 4 yuan and 4 fen. If the weather clears up, the quality can be dried, and the market price can turn advantageous.</p>

Over 170-180 boxes were released in the market yesterday. It is found that the cost of the last batch of arrivals is very high, and the shipping deadline is far away in August and September, so it is not easy for market prices to fall back for a while.</p>

<p>Haikou tree rubber (i.e., raw material for rubber overshoes) has been lacking in arrivals for a long time, and inventory is also exhausted. It was heard yesterday that new goods from the producing area have already entered the market, and firms in the Swatow gang have already transported a small number of them. Samples have been seen. Because it is the first time seeing the new product, the quality is relatively soft, and the degree of toughness is also slightly inferior, but the color is still good. The market is expected to open within a few days.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coolidge said: "The reason Americans are successful in doing things is because they are not afraid of failure, and whatever they have in mind to do, they will put their whole heart into it, go all out, and simply not think that there will be any failure. If there is a failure, they will immediately stand up, embrace an even greater determination, and strive forward until they succeed." This saying can be our motto.</p>
<p>"An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time." This means that time is precious because other things, once lost, can be recovered. Only time, once a minute is lost, there is one minute less. Once a moment has passed, it is lost. Once lost, no matter what power you use, you can never recover it. But many people think that today has passed, there is still tomorrow, and the tomorrow of today, and the tomorrow of tomorrow. If you think so erroneously and throw away golden time, wouldn't it be a pity? Young people! Stop dreaming about the tomorrow of tomorrow. You must seize the present and do it. Otherwise, when your hair is white, it will be too late to regret.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Spring Boating on West Stream <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Lake Beggar</p>
<p>West Stream is known for its snow, and boating is enjoyed during the clear frost and hot maple leaves. If it is in the third month of spring, floating on a bay of misty water, there are few visitors. Because the place is secluded, unlike the hustle and bustle of West Lake with its carriages weaving through and the rolling yellow dust, I took a boat to explore it at my leisure. It was the busy season for farming, and the fields were full of plowing and mulberry cultivation. The misty villages were sparse, and who was living in leisure? At Hejia Wharf, I called for a ferry for some time before I got an old woman who agreed to go with a large fee. As the lone oar first released, seagulls dotted the water like snow. How could this scene be found on the Six Bridges? After several turns, the water country opened in seclusion. Emerging from the shore, the new trees were a mix of trees, all green and lush. Only a few cuckoos called to each other overhead. Further away, the fields were filled with lush green seedlings, and the mulberries were heavy and purple, all worthy of painting. Occasionally passing one or two fences, dogs barked in surprise. Scolding them, they followed the shore without stopping until the branch of the harbor stopped. The boat arrived at Jiaolu Nunnery, resting on the waterfront railing. The empty corridor was silent, with only fish and frogs communicating with each other. Lotus stalks in the pool were just emerging, and the green duckweed was not yet halfway there, so the fallen heads and temples in the water could still be clearly seen. Entering Fangshen Temple, a niche of incense and fire, worshiping the poetess, I often recall the endless waves and red sails. Further west is Qiuxue Nunnery. Leaning on the Finger-snapping Tower, gazing at the 30 acres of green reeds competing for emerald green, the vitality before me is so great, who knows that they will all turn white in autumn? As the sun sets and the clouds return, the shadows of people lie horizontally on the algae. Looking at the evening cooking in the distant lake, it is slowly rising up.</p>
<h3 id="e235">On Human Flavor <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ke</p>
<p>To be a person, one must have a flavor that people appreciate. People's faces are different, and human flavors are also different.</p>
<p>The human flavor that is expressed on the outside is called body odor. This odor is different for everyone. If you are quiet and get used to it, you can always tell the difference. It can always be confirmed between husband and wife, because they are most used to each other. Smelling it is an odor, and it is rarely as fragrant as orchids throughout the ages, so it is called: body odor beauty! The name is beautiful, because it comes from the true source, even if it smells, it is also beautiful.</p>
<p>The human flavor that is stored inside is called addiction. People's addictions are different in elegance, vulgarity, evil, and righteousness. The beauty and ugliness of the strange and bizarre are endless. In short, each has its own flavor to find. Those who are similar can get together and those who are suppressed will be rejected. This is the truth of human nature, which is not necessarily unworthy of being called addiction beauty.</p>
<p>Indeed! Zhang Dai's "Record of Qi Zhixiang's Addiction" says: "People without addictions cannot be associated with, because they have no deep feelings; people without flaws cannot be associated with, because they have no true spirit. My friend Qi Zhixiang has an addiction to calligraphy and painting, an addiction to kicking football, an addiction to drums and bells, an addiction to ghost shows, an addiction to pear gardens..." Oh, what a thick human flavor this is!</p>
<p>If Zhang Xianzhong, people know that his addiction is killing people. The addiction is to kill and kill, which is his truth, and makes him feel cute!</p>
<p>If Gu Hongming, people say that his addiction is the smell of small feet. It is certainly an addiction to smell and smell, which is also his truth, and I also feel that he is cute!</p>
<p>Many of my compatriots are addicted to rolling cigarettes and opium! They are not ashamed to draw and draw on them, which is also true, and very cute! But some people boast about their precision and elaborate their shelves with laws that are not forbidden, while others embellish their words to reduce the amount and avoid them as deeply as possible, because the orders are strict. These are all self-deprecating their truth, and I don't think they are very cute!</p>
<p>There are different types of addictions: some like to eat scabs, and some like to defecate. The son of a certain Mr. in my neighborhood has been addicted to salt since he was a child. He would be lethargic and sick if he did not eat a few handfuls of salt every day, and he still does not give up when he grows up. A certain girl in my distant neighborhood, with a wonderful age and beautiful appearance, likes to chew the grass paper used for wiping dirt behind her back. All kinds of things can be compiled into a huge volume. These people are usually ashamed of being different from others, and although it is not very cute to avoid them, it is the norm, and they do not lose their addiction.</p>
<p>This is why the charter of a certain society does not prohibit addictions, nor does it advise people to quit smoking?</p>
<p>If the body has no odor, it is not far from death; if a person has no addictions, what is the difference between him and animals? Oh! Do these people lack human flavor? I greatly lament them!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Spendthrift Woman <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Spendthrift Woman is a pitiful woman who was driven out of a large clan in our village. That was already thirteen years ago. The woman was originally the fourth young mistress of a certain room in this big family. Three years after she got married, her husband, the fourth young master, fell ill. After the fourth young master passed away, the four walls were bare. All that was left was a son who had just passed his first birthday. Her husband's brothers did not take care of themselves well, so naturally they did not take care of the fourth young mistress very much. At that time, the fourth young mistress was only twenty-one years old. Alone in an empty bedroom, the situation was bleak. Needless to say, the lives of the mother and son depended on the two piculs of rice from the charity village every year, which was naturally not enough. Because of the lack of food and sex, she had an affair with a tea merchant who came and went every spring and autumn, who lived across the street.</p>
<p>In a town of three or four hundred families, things the size of sesame seeds would be treated as news and rumors, let alone the fourth young mistress, who was the daughter-in-law of this big family, actually doing this kind of thing. Immediately, one told ten, and ten told hundreds. The tea houses and taverns all treated it as a novel thing to spread. This aroused the anger of the clan chief of this big family, who opened the ancestral hall and discussed it with the whole clan, driving her out of the ancestral hall and escorting her out of the country to protect the reputation of the whole clan. From then on, no one knew where the fourth young mistress was, and the tea merchant no longer came to this town to do business. All that was left was the bloodline of the fourth young master, raised by the second young mistress, and a nickname given to her by the clan, "Spendthrift Woman."</p>
<p>Time quickly passed for thirteen years. This spring, a woman was suddenly discovered sweeping and crying at the tomb of the fourth young master. Although she was a bit old, everyone still recognized her as the Spendthrift Woman who was driven out thirteen years ago. It turned out that after she was driven out, she lived with the tea merchant. Now that the tea merchant was dead, she received an inheritance of thirty to forty thousand yuan. Because she could not forget the old sword, she came to sweep the tomb. As soon as this news spread, it caused a sensation throughout the clan again. It is heard that someone has mediated, donating 10,000 yuan to the ancestral hall, not pursuing the past, and allowing her to restore her surname.</p>
<p>This scene seems comical, but there are many sour and spicy things hidden inside.</p>
<p>Respectfully Announcing to Those Suffering from Jaundice: I suffered from jaundice again this time, my whole body was yellow, and I went to many famous doctors for treatment, but it was ineffective. Thanks to a close friend who introduced me to Mr. Wang Xinnan of Yi Da North Goods Store, No. 131 Xian Gua Street, outside Xiaodongmen. He had herbal medicine at home to treat this disease. Mr. Wang generously gave it to me, and after taking it for a week, the disease was cured. During this period, I did not spend any money, and I am very grateful. Now, because Mr. Wang has the good deed of giving medicine to help the world, I hereby announce it to those suffering from the same disease. (Song Qing)</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Fragrant Grass and Beautiful Women, Subtle Waves, and New Posts; Moonlit Night in the Small Building, Good Dreams Begin to Warm</p>
<p>Meng Yue was filled with worries after hearing these words. She thought that even Lian Budong was poisoned by these talented men and beautiful women. Thinking like this, she was too lazy to go downstairs for dinner, so she just asked Xiao Ju to send a pot of pot rice soaked in boiling water upstairs, and a small plate of pickled cabbage, which was her dinner. After dinner, she read two pages of books under the lamp, but she couldn't calm down. By chance, she looked up and saw a glittering thing in the willows next to the wall, dazzling. At first glance, she couldn't help but be surprised, but after looking carefully, it was the moon on the sixteenth night, a round circle, that had been gushing out for a long time. Unlike other trees, willows do not have big leaves that can block the light. It was swaying in the wind, flashing and revealing part of the moon, which was a different kind of interest. Also, where the moon was directly facing, the willow branches looked like they were coated with a layer of gold paint, which was even more beautiful. Meng Lan first looked at it by chance, but now she found it interesting, so she extinguished the lamp on the table, then lay on the table and looked up at the sky, reciting old poems at random. Although the poems were recited casually, most of the sentences were sad, so she was very unhappy with the beautiful moon scene. She suddenly thought that the ancients said that women are good at feeling sad, but that is actually a mistake. Chinese women are oppressed by etiquette, and they can't do what they want to do, and they can't say what they want to say. Besides thinking alone, where is the second way? Zhang Litian invented the four words "melancholy for the rest of their lives" in his novel that failed to win the pair, which is really appropriate. It's a pity that I can't write novels. If I could write novels, I would definitely use the four words "melancholy for the rest of their lives" as the title and write an article about the pain of women. Thinking of this, she felt a burst of numbness on the back of her hand, and then she realized that she was crossing her hands and supporting her chin, looking at the sky in a daze, forgetting to press on the back of her hand. This was a bit tired, and she was too lazy to light the lamp, so she closed the door and went to bed in a daze. As soon as her head hit the pillow, she thought of the two tall willows, facing each other all day long, but she had never really gone to the tree to linger. Tomorrow, I'll get up early and visit the willow trees when there's no one in the vegetable garden. With this plan, she was standing under two big willow trees the next morning. Looking up at the willow tree, the highest top was densely layered with willow branches, and she could hardly see the sky. However, the sun was not very strong, but it looked like the moon. She recited the ancient people's poem, "The moon is on the top of the willow tree, and people will meet after dusk." Then she heard someone behind her say: "This is also a melancholy for the rest of her life, right?" Looking back, it was the boy she met in Yuhuatai? He was still holding a small branch of apricot blossom and nodded with a smile: "This flower is for you." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e240">Chinese Under the Armored Train <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>Vsevolod Ivanov is a highly acclaimed modern Soviet writer. Among his many works is a novel depicting a peasant guerrilla team attacking an armored train during the Great Revolution: "The Armored Train." It is considered his most outstanding representative work. In 1932, Turkish journalists and writers visited the Soviet literary world. During their second meeting with Gorky, Gorky responded to the request of the Turkish guests and specifically pointed out this "Armored Train" to introduce to them, praising it as a noteworthy modern Soviet literary work. The famous critic Professor Kogan also gave it honorable praise in his "Ten Great Years of Literature." This novel, which is recognized as outstanding, has been translated into almost every country in the world, and has also been adapted into a drama for the stage. In the Soviet Union, the director of "The Armored Train" was the great contemporary director Stanislavsky. During the Soviet Drama Festival of 1933—June 1st—10th—on the third night of national celebration, "The Armored Train" was performed at the world-famous Moscow "Art Grand Theater." The role of the peasant guerrilla chief of staff, Vershinin, was played by the great dramatist Kacbalov. The American "Pasadena Playhouse" has also performed it many times.</p>
<p>Here, firstly because "The Armored Train" is a world-famous literary work, and secondly because we Chinese, who have always been despised by foreigners, are given a superior position in this book thanks to the author; and also given the honorary title of "Chinese Dragon," we feel even more fortunate to have received unexpected favor. Among the many revolutionary warriors, there is actually such a brave and upright hero that Russians admire and are ashamed of—the Chinese Shen Fangwu. Although this is a fictional character of a friendly writer, we are constantly looking forward to whether our national character can actually reciprocate their friendly gift. Indeed, it breeds that general hope, so we should especially solemnly introduce this Chinese under the armored train:</p>
<p>Regarding the deeds of Shen Fangwu, according to the narration in the original book, we can briefly retell a little here: He—Shen Fangwu, was a Chinese worker who had gone to Russia to weave mats. Perhaps due to hard work and frugality, he had a wife, a house, and a field of sorghum and corn. Unfortunately, in one day, his estate and property were destroyed by the fire of Imperlaticism, and everything disappeared. He resented his enemies and therefore sympathized with the revolution—he joined the peasant guerrilla team and followed the big-nosed, thick-bearded Russian, Vershinin, as a scout under his command. When the "Polar" armored train No. 1469, commanded by Captain Nebylatzov, was ordered to go to Vladivostok to suppress the uprising that was about to break out in the city, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Pokrevalov, ordered Vershinin to lead his peasant guerrilla team to the railway line in Mokrenka River to intercept this armored train and block its progress. On Vershinin's side, since receiving this order, someone suggested demolishing the rails, but after considering the difficulty of repairing them with the current manpower, Vershinin changed it to seeking a volunteer to lie on the rails and let the wheels of the armored train run over his body. Then, according to the rules, the armored train would definitely stop, and the commander and driver on the train would definitely get out to inspect the dead body on the rails and prepare to make a report. After such a twist, the strategic interception would not only be easy to succeed, but perhaps the "Polar" armored train, which was the strongest in combat power, could be seized. Later, because no one was willing to let his flesh touch the steel wheels, the quartermaster Okolok was angry. He threw away the gun in his hand and fell on the rails. Although he struggled with the last bit of courage to offer his flesh and blood to the steel and sacrifice for the strategy; but the terror of death before death eventually made him tremble a little. At this serious and tense moment, our Chinese Shen Fangwu, who had been very calm since the march, sprang up. He felt that it was cowardly and shameful for Okolok to lie on the rails and ask the peasants for vodka, so he ran over with a sneer and lay beside Okolok. As Okolok quietly left the rails with a guilty smile, the revolutionary passion, burning like a flame, further strengthened his determination to sacrifice. Before the "Polar" armored train No. 1469 arrived, he first raised his pistol and fired a shot at the back of his head, and then lay hard on the rails waiting for the rumbling of the wheels. As a result, Vershinin won the battle of hitting the train, the uprising in Vladivostok broke out, and the final victory belonged to our "Chinese under the armored train."</p>
<p>If Ivanov's "Armored Train" can be regarded as a true and accurate history, then in the history of the Soviet revolutionary war, our Chinese Shen Fangwu, perhaps, cannot be regarded as a dazzling superstar. If we turn back and unfold our own history of the Chinese revolutionary war: from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's organization of the "Revive China Society" and the advocacy of justice, to the Battle of Huanghuagang, to the Wuchang Uprising; as well as several great and tragic bloody battles in the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, and the glorious war of "January 28th" which is worth singing and weeping about, during this period, those equivalent to "the Chinese Shen Fangwu under the armored train" will be countless brave and upright heroes that Russians admire and are ashamed of. However, the seeds of honor are striving, and the back of boasting may be encouragement; rise up, Chinese under the armored train! The remaining pages of history are waiting for brilliant records.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Ten Thousand Miles of Fragrance <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>A few days ago, some friends went to Beiping for a trip. When they returned, I asked them about their impressions and feelings of the trip. They said that there were over two hundred of them, and they were just skimming the surface every day, like following an old woman to a wedding banquet, and they didn't get any impressions or feelings at all. However, they felt that the remnants of feudal ideology still filled the air of the old capital. Besides, they avoided talking about politics, as if there was an invisible and vicious force shrouding everyone's minds, suffocating their chests.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing I must tell you. After traveling during the day, we rested in our residence. The attendant asked, "Gentlemen, would you like to smoke opium?" I was surprised and asked, "Is opium not prohibited here at all?" The attendant replied, "No, it is forbidden elsewhere. But if you go to Ten Thousand Miles of Fragrance in Stone Hutong, there will be no problem." At first, I didn't understand what he meant, so I went with a friend. Upon entering, I saw a man with a small mustache behind the counter, sitting there sternly. Then I understood why there was no problem smoking opium there.</p>
<p>Entering the room, there were no fewer than seventy or eighty opium couches, and the business was very prosperous. Swallowing clouds and spitting fog, the room was filled with poisonous fumes. We didn't have opium addiction, but we just wanted to pass the time and witness the newly emerged miracle of Beiping. After it was over, the attendant said, "How was it? In the past, as long as a certain prince or lord supported something in Beiping, nothing would go wrong. Now, as long as the man with the small mustache supports something, anything that violates the law can be done. The organization and capital of Ten Thousand Miles of Fragrance do not belong to the man with the small mustache. He is just their shield. Now, as long as the man with the small mustache appears, nothing will happen." Hearing this, I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>I heard that in the north, the man with the small mustache sells drugs, organizes gambling and takes a cut, and extorts money from the people, which has become their proper profession. I think fundamentally, it is our own fault. If they sell drugs, and we don't use their drugs, then they can't do anything. If they organize gambling and take a cut, and we don't want to get rich, they can't do anything. Now, they are engaged in illegal business, and their business is booming. In the final analysis, it is mostly our own fault. This is one point. Besides, there are also some traitors and lackeys who only seek profit and act as accomplices, using the man with the small mustache as a signboard to implement policies of suicide and self-destruction. The reason why our country cannot be saved lies in this.</p>
<p>For example, in the recent smuggling, if the people of our country had a little conscience, it would be very easy to prohibit this kind of smuggled goods. As long as merchants don't sell it for them, and the people don't buy it, then even if they smuggle, there is no way to smuggle. The method of resistance is very simple. However, merchants are blinded by profit, and the people don't know how to love their country, so the affairs of our country are getting worse and worse. Now, to stop it, we want to use conscience to restrain it, but conscience is no longer reliable. We want to use the law to restrain it, but the national law is also beyond reach. Is there really no way to deal with this? Or is there a way, but we are carefully considering it and unwilling to use it?</p>
<p>Alas, when I hear the three words "Ten Thousand Miles of Fragrance," I can't help but feel horrified, astonished, and surprised!</p>
<h3 id="e242">On the Wilderness <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Li Quanwen</p>
<p>Moonlit night, no wind, silvery liquid covers the entire Rabi wilderness.</p>
<p>The wilderness is vast and flat, stretching endlessly into the darkness in the distance. No sheds, no shadows of trees, no fields can be seen, only a patch of green pasture reveals the only wealth here.</p>
<p>We lightly whip, the horses trample forward on the rugged mud road dried after the rain. The unrhythmic sound of the wheels, the occasional snoring of the pigs on the cart, and our sporadic conversations monotonously break the silence of the wilderness.</p>
<p>We are regulars of the wilderness: every ten days we have to set off in the middle of the night, and trample across this wilderness to the market in the town dozens of miles away.</p>
<p>At first, this was a job that I hated and regretted, but I quickly got used to it; to the point that in the lonely journey, often without companions, I would quietly use meditation and the scenery of the night to adjust myself.</p>
<p>This time my companion was a Batavian man who grew vegetables. We met at a fork in the road just as we were about to enter this wilderness. Although we were strangers, we had the common habit of those who went to the market: the sympathy born out of the remote and lonely night journey quickly connected us into one. He was the tenant of two acres of land, a melancholy middle-aged man, who spoke very little, and every word he uttered was tinged with deep sadness. However, it was easy to see that he also had a hope, and even eagerly guarded the burning of that hope. Although the growth of that hope was only irrigated by sadness.</p>
<p>I am a nervous person who is easily moved and has an excessive amount of feelings, and his sadness quickly soaked through me involuntarily; in the sad meditation, I unconsciously and slowly floated up past struggles and future anxieties.</p>
<p>"This world"! I thought, and couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>"Uncle (Note 1), it must be hard for you?"</p>
<p>"What hardships do we have to feel? This world: alas, we were originally weeds grown out of bitterness!"</p>
<p>I gently raised the whip in the air and waved it, making a crisp cracking sound: occasionally the pigs on the cart also spewed out vague groans like snorts in their sleep, but immediately the deathly silence enveloped the surroundings again, leaving the sound of the wheels mechanically spreading to all directions.</p>
<p>I re-buried myself in contemplation, and sighs and resentment under the trampling of the iron hooves of the oppressive nation. …</p>
<p>"Uncle!" My companion suddenly woke up the sleeping silence and my thoughts. "Do you think we will have a day to stand up"?</p>
<p>"Oh! Even solid walls have their collapse, one day when our strength is enough, we will be able to climb the ladder!"</p>
<p>"But, uncle, …"</p>
<p>"Weak nations have gradually opened their eyes under the dazzling sunlight; have you heard that a prairie fire can be quieted with water from buckets?"</p>
<p>"But! Um, at what time? Uncle, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"Maybe the day after tomorrow, maybe there will always be a time when we can climb the ladder!"</p>
<p>"That's what I think, uncle!"</p>
<p>My companion's horse suddenly raised its nasal voice and screamed sharply, and my gray horse followed with its long scream that seemed to be rolling its tongue in its nose; this scream first rolled in the nearby air, slowly drifted in all directions in the wilderness and finally disappeared into the boundless darkness in the distance; but it seemed that there was still a faint echo bouncing back from a distance, still lingering in my ears.</p>
<p>"That year: we succeeded and then!"</p>
<p>My companion muttered sadly; shaking the whip in his hand again and again in the air, but never swung it even once.</p>
<p>"That was a good bomb; didn't your compatriots wake up a lot because of it?"</p>
<p>"But, uncle, the prevention is even more severe!"</p>
<p>"The dike cannot regulate the turbulent flood, and the fence cannot stop the flying birds! You know!"</p>
<p>"However, those immersed in numbness are as many as flies! Uncle."</p>
<p>"A lump of ice will slowly dissolve when it falls into hot water! Who has ever seen a painting that is colored well in one go?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Uncle! You think the same as me! Really came out of one brain!"</p>
<p>"……"</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The pig spat out its vague ramblings again: a lower place on the road made my car vibrate slightly more violently.</p>
<p>"There will always be a time when we can climb the ladder, there will always be that day!"</p>
<p>My companion sighed a long breath, and when he said the word "day" at the end, he waved the whip in the air several times more forcefully: the sharp cracking sound startled his horse and made it run a few steps faster.</p>
<p>While speaking, the wheels followed the road and turned a large bend on the wilderness. The road back formed a very neat right angle on the right.</p>
<p>The wilderness returned to silence as before. We were all silent, each jumped into the pond of contemplation, silently letting the wheels break the boundless silence with its unrhythmic sound and carry us into the darkness in the distance. …</p>

<h3 id="e243">The Village Chief's Home <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>Before dinner, in the dim twilight, a thin, tall man rudely walked into the house. I recognized him at a glance. He was Mou San's son from the West Village, the gatekeeper and gunman who had been hired in our village two years ago. It was said that he had been making a living at home by fishing and hunting wild birds for the past two years. He looked a little more haggard, dark, and thin than when he was a gatekeeper. It seemed that the world had given him a lot of wind, frost, and torture in the past two years.</p>
<p>His father was the village chief. At this time, he was wearing a civil servant uniform, leaning obliquely on the kang, smoking a long pipe. The man sat uncomfortably on the edge of the kang. After answering a few questions from others absentmindedly, he said solemnly and unnaturally:</p>
<p>"Village Chief, I have been implicated by Cheng Wang?"</p>
<p>The whole room was silent for a moment. We were all very familiar with Cheng Wang's case. He was a murderer who caused a stir in the area for the sake of money. Just a few days ago, he was tied up with his bloody clothes and led to the city.</p>
<p>The father slowly exhaled a long stream of smoke from the left corner of his mouth, and said without expression:</p>
<p>"How did you know?"</p>
<p>"Today, the village chief from that village went to my house and said: 'Someone, Cheng Wang has implicated you. If you don't want to be involved in the case, you have to have a plan not to be involved!'—He first came with such a big scare, and then whispered sneakily: 'I think you should run away. Ask your grandpa to take out some money, and I will take care of things for you.'"</p>
<p>He was a little out of breath. After a slight pause, he said more excitedly:</p>
<p>"Village Chief, what do you think he is saying! Isn't this just framing me? Why should I run? Where should I run? I haven't committed any crime out of thin air..."</p>
<p>The father remained silent, which made the man a little embarrassed. He quietly changed his breath and said again:</p>
<p>"I came here specifically to ask what's going on? To get guidance from the village chief, what should I do about this?"</p>
<p>The father rolled his eyelids at him, as if putting him on a scale to weigh him, and said:</p>
<p>"Are you really innocent?"</p>
<p>He stood up all of a sudden:</p>
<p>"Village Chief, I am naturally innocent. I have been hired in this village. You can't say you don't know my temper. I am poor, but I am honest. I can't do things like killing people for money."</p>
<p>The father said again so calmly:</p>
<p>"It's good if you're really innocent. But when a thief bites, it goes in three inches deep. You have to admit you're unlucky."</p>
<p>When he was about to leave, a long-term worker was wrapping a package of gunpowder. He said casually:</p>
<p>"What? Gunpowder?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got a wild duck today, but I missed it!" The long-term worker said very proudly.</p>
<p>"That stuff is nothing rare. In a few days, I will catch a few and send them over."</p>
<p>Saying that, he walked out with sparse footsteps.</p>
<p>After he left, the father tapped the edge of the kang with the bowl of his pipe and said:</p>
<p>"Not a good thing either, unreliable!"</p>
<p>I said: "The village chief is not good either, he wants to rip him off."</p>
<p>The father's lips moved, but he didn't speak.</p>
<p>The next evening, I was reading a book in the house by the light of the paper window, when suddenly I heard my mother shouting in the yard:</p>
<p>"Ka, come and see, Mou Dasheng brought some wild ducks!"</p>
<p>I ran out and saw the man standing on the platform, a long shotgun leaning against the brick wall next to the door, two pairs of beautiful wild ducks curled up at his feet, my mother was bending over, smiling and examining them.</p>
<p>The mother said:</p>
<p>"This thing is really beautiful, so lifelike, how can I eat it! Can't I keep it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't even eat it," he laughed unnaturally. "Madam, please stir-fry and eat it quickly, this thing is very fragrant, even better than chicken. When I catch some that are in good condition, I will send them over to keep, these are all broken."</p>
<p>Two pairs of little things, crawling restlessly on the ground, with green, light yellow, and silver-white feathers combining into beautiful patterns. Flat and long beaks, curved necks, forming a novel shape. On one of the wings, bright red blood was oozing. I was dominated by a feeling of liking and pity.</p>
<p>In order to understand the mood of this man who hunted birds all year round, I shifted my gaze to this man's face, his dark, dry, haggard face was half-raised, and he was distractedly lost in thought in the spring breeze of the evening. I suddenly remembered his thoughts last night, as if suddenly struck by an inexplicable blow.</p>
<p>I silently retreated back into the house, and heard him nagging to his mother about what he had discussed last night.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Oyuya (Hot Bath House) <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>——Etchings of Tokyo——</p>
<p>This is a bathhouse. The storefront also has cloth curtains like those of "yakitori" shops, but these cloth curtains are clean, although the cloth is mostly the same light blue. The words diagonally arranged on these cloth curtains are also particularly large, and the two words before and after (the "O" and "ya" characters) are also written in Roman letters. However, even without that sign, you wouldn't mistake it for a food business. Because the door is very spacious and clean, especially the roof is high and towering. At the same time, at 11:00 AM, especially after 5:00 or 6:00 PM, if you walk past the door or from the side, the sound of wooden basins and hard earthen floors hitting each other, like striking a wooden fish, will be transmitted to your ears, sometimes loud and sometimes soft.</p>
<p>If you are a newcomer, and if you have a shy heart that respects yourself, when you walk through that main hall door, please be sure to look up at the two entrances and determine the direction you should go by reading the words "male" or "female" written above them. At the entrance, there are one or two men or women greeting you, putting the wooden clogs you take off (boots are the same) on the rack next to them, and first giving you a wooden tag in the shape of a "Great Sword" brand cigarette with a number written on it. When you leave, you can use it to claim all your belongings. Once inside, located in the front center of the two scenes, there is a high platform, on which sits a male or female boss. In addition to receiving your "five cents" entrance fee or keeping any valuables you deposit, they always sit idly, looking at the men in this scene or the women in that scene. At most, when you come in, they will say: "Irasshai!" (Welcome!) When you leave, they will say: "Arigato!" (Thank you!)</p>
<p>After you give the money and step onto the floor paved with tatami mats, a girl will greet you and bring the rattan basket (you can take it yourself) to you to take off your clothes. Then you take your own towel and soap and walk into the bathhouse naked. There are wooden basins there, and many hot and cold water taps extend from the wall, so you will make the wooden basin and the water taps do whatever action. You can pour warm water directly on your body basin by basin, and then you can soak as much as possible in the hot water tank inside, no matter how much sweat flows down your forehead and face like a waterfall. It is said that letting it flow a lot is the most hygienic. When you think you are satisfied, then you step out of the tank and go straight to the previous location to do your bathing work. If you are reluctant to part with the hot water in the tank, no one will interfere if you soak a few more times. If you want to be more carefree, you can also. There are people inside who specialize in pounding your back. It is said that you have to give five more cents to give you this carefree feeling.</p>

<p>— Written by Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Liya That guy, he doesn't care about your act at all, he is naturally frivolous! No matter how serious you act, he will make all kinds of gestures to tease you.</p>
<p>Jinghong He didn't have this attitude towards me, because my serious attitude can control his frivolity, and I have already talked to him, and we have also exchanged business cards, although his attitude is a bit silly, but he is very sincere, I don't think he is a sophisticated social person.</p>
<p>Liya That's his trick, he deliberately does this so that you will favor him...</p>
<p>Jinghong Don't talk nonsense, his trick won't deceive me, and it's even more impossible for me to favor him!</p>
<p>Dajun Oh! Excuse me! Miss Shen, can I say a word?</p>
<p>Jinghong Yes, Mr. Zhao,</p>
<p>Dajun I dare not misunderstand what this unnamed lady said about me, but I already feel that I should leave this seat immediately and let this lady sit here and talk to you, because this lady said too much, and her neck must be sore at this time.</p>

Encountering that. The dashing and romantic young man, named Xianglian, is crazy in character. They are. Meeting face-to-face is like knowing each other from the past. Giving a precious sword and making a marriage vow. Can be regarded as. A perfect match between a talented man and a beautiful woman. Entrusting the end of life forever. I don't know. A sudden storm occurs. Lies enter the ear, regret is hard to bear. Young master Liu shows his bare face, returns the love sword. The Third Sister. Pain breaks the heart. Drawing out a sharp blue sword, as fast as lightning. Committing suicide for no reason and dying on the spot. Peach blossom blood splatters the skirt. Xianglian is shocked and loses his mind. From then on. Entering the mountains with disheveled hair to cultivate the Tao. Eliminating the obstacles of love in return for the Third Sister. All eleven gold hairpins are charming and enchanting. Only the Third Sister has a strong character. A clod of yellow earth buries the across pond.</p>

<p>Opening Southwest Record "Long Pavilion"</p>
<p>Partings and reunions, joys and sorrows, all in a cup of wine. A banquet is held in the Long Pavilion to see Qiu Kui off. Only because the lady's exam is difficult to pass. I have to go to the capital for a while. But I see the shadow of the blue skirt of departure from the horizon. Yellow flowers are scattered on the ground, stirring up sadness. I think of Liang Yuan's sweet dew ascending to the clouds. Sooner or later, it is difficult to tell, it is against the will of heaven. I steadily climb the laurel tree in the Moon Palace. I vow to return without a name on the golden list. Brother. You must take care on the windy and frosty journey. Don't urge me on the long journey on horseback. Let the horse go slowly. Let the cart follow closely. A whip of the setting sun urges the shadow to move. I will enjoy the beauty of the capital. Shen Rong returns to his hometown in embroidered clothes. Good things are often difficult to achieve. Don't hang a thin life in your heart. River fish and sky geese should be entrusted. I look forward to the golden letter of good news. I can't finish. Thousands of words of concern. I can't help. The chaotic dust blows in my face. The most bitter thing in life is separation. I will be separated from you after sending you a thousand miles. Our two hearts will follow each other in dreams tonight.</p>

<p>Xu Xinfu's "Diamond," has been filming very hard these past few days. The stars and colleagues have given Xu Xinfu another name, "Xu Jingang", with the meaning derived from the "Jingang" in "Diamond".</p>
<p>Yesterday in "Diamond" a scene – a stage scene, was of an entertainment gathering held by an orphanage to examine funds. The Gu sisters, Lanjun and Meijun, starred, and several hundred temporary spectators were invited. Logically, watching female stars perform on stage should require purchasing tickets out of one's own pocket, but in fact, these hundreds of spectators not only watched the play for free, but each received a salary of one yuan, plus a free lunch. Moreover, the Gu sisters performed very seriously, no wonder once the scene was over, cheers thundered, and hundreds of different faces were filled with intoxicating spring breeze.</p>
