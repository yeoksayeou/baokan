<p>論文</p>
<h3>歲首展望</h3>
<p>— 張梓生</p>
<p>在照例的一句「恭喜新年」之後，便不能不想到：這方來的一年，其前途是凶是吉？依理，當這國難增進的過程中，除掉空想家，斷不能抱樂觀。但是事在人為，無論環境怎樣惡劣，只要國人能不頹唐，能努力奮鬬，也未始不可掙扎出一條光明之路來。這並非記者好為空談，有戰後幾個新興國家的實例，可以作蹬！</p>
<p>展望所及的，第一是中國的國難。試先回憶近五年來的經過：自從二十年的「九一八」，我們國土十分之一的東三省，被强鄰軍事佔領後；第二年有「一二八」的釁端，於一部分領土主權人民被蹂躪外，全國經濟中心區域，也將被摧毀；第三年失一熱河，並訂立塘沽協定；第四年受着「四一七」聲明的威脅，全國主權遭人侵害；去年是第五年，在經濟提携聲中，尙不免夏間的華北事件及冬間的僞自治運動的發生。現在到第六年了。這一年中，形勢將好轉呢，還是愈益惡劣？中國的存亡，世界的和平與混亂，都與這間題的解答，有着緊切的聯繫。自然，非把握到　＃强鄰能吾悔禍與　中國能吾興起的二點，這問題頗難於置答。現在只能展望：倘使廣田對華三原則（十一月間華北風雲緊急時所提出）與最近中國國民醒覺的情形，可以作為展望將來的資料，那麼，今日開始的一長年，將成為强鄰澈底解决對華問題與中國發揮生存能力的最後掙扎期間了。</p>
<p>復决，民國二十五年就是久已聳動全球聽聞的一九三六年。在幾年以前，世界論軍事的，豫料過一九三六年的人類危機，並揣測過戰禍慘烈的情形。現在，時期到了。展望情勢：除中國問題以外，在歐洲，英意關係，無人敢决定他們一定不致用武；關於殖民地的爭奪，東菲的事件，正繼續開展；在遠東，日蘇對峙的趨勢，從中東路的問題更進而達到爭壓外蒙的階段；在太平洋方面，日美間表面雖尙未達緊張程度，雙方內部的備戰行動，則各在積極進行。究竟一九三六年世界大戰的豫言，能吾不致成事實，現在無法斷定；不過看到了上述各方面的形勢，却使人不寒而慄。允其在我們中國人，無論戰事起於何方，總不能不受到影饗，總無法避免戰禍。中國要在國際求共存，當這年頭，非注意應付不可。政治領袖近來喜講舊道德，記者敢借道學家的「立定脚跟」一語來作貢獻。</p>
<p>展望到國內情形，比較的能使人興奮。第一，這將成為召開國民大會結束訓政的一年。自十六國民政府奠都南京，十七年完成北伐軍事，中國黨治時期，迄今已歷九年。十八年六月中央通過訓政時期之規定案，明定訓政六年，至二十四年完成。其間二十年五月中央全體會議雖討論國民會議案，二十一年國難會議中雖有提前設立民意機關（國民代表會議）的决議，都未實現。這回經過五全大會决議，限二十五年內實施召開國民大會宣布憲法草案後，又得一中全會决定：今年五月宣布憲草，十一月十二日召開國民大會。這不僅幾年來高唱民治的人士可以興高彩烈，全國人民，也多因將有參預政權的機會而改變政治心理。所以，這一年，就國民大會召集的事件說，將使全國人民因準備參與政權而積極興奮。第二，民氣振奮的結果將使救國運動獲有實效。記者用最近學生運動來作展望的根據：國難以來，外侮的加重與民氣的興奮不能成正比例，自十二月九日北平學生首起請願，全國饗應，風氣為之一變。政治當局雖對各地學生紛欲晋京，有勸導阻止的麻煩，但對學生愛國運動始終同情，於學生所提正當請求全予接受，這是從來未有的好現象。一月十五日將見學生代表與政治領袖聚首一堂，討論救國方案。倘使此後的愛國運動，能精神永保而不越適當範圍，則在最近的一年中，於救國大計，一定能有良好的實效，這是不容忽視的。第三，政治經濟的動向。中國國民黨的精誠團結共赴國難，為自二十年四全大會以來所繼續企求的，在五大會中竟得見「無論南北遠近，悉除私見共圖國事」的良好現象。勦匪工作，自前年第五决大圍勦成功後，也繼續表顯成績。二十五年內，倘再能繼續向這途轍發展，則政治可以穩定，一切建設事業，都有進行的機會。最艱難的，是經濟方面的情形，在受世界潮流的侵襲壓追中，國內農村破產，都市蕭條，加以災害不息，國難未已。在這環境中，財政部實施通貨管理政策，未能完全救濟商業的困難；經濟委員會努力進行經濟建設事業，無法收效於目前。記者展望到這一點，不能不感覺二十五年的一年，仍將與國人艱難困苦的生活，發生無法解免的關係了。</p>
<p>民國二十五年，是中國人必須努力掙扎的一年。前途的光明如何，要看國人掙扎的力量！</p>
<h3>一年來的歐美和平與戰爭的轉機</h3>
<p>— 徐逸</p>
<p>一九三五年則纔交進的時候，歐美各國還好像都能相安無事。雖然國際聯盟早已失去了牠的靈魂；軍縮會議早已完全失收；歐洲大陸上的兩個獨裁國家，竭力在重整軍備，擴張領土；南美洲的兩個小國，更連年戰爭，蠻觸不已。然而因為上年南斯拉夫和匃牙利的爭端，竟能和平解决；一月十三日薩爾區的人民投票，竟能使各方滿意；後來歐洲幾個强國的政治家，用了縱橫捭闔的手段，歷决會議，又成立了許多互保和平的協定：大家都覺得至少暫時總可以保守一個小康的景象了。豈知這些協定簽字的墨瀋未乾，已經大半成為廢紙。有些國家為了自己的利益，便不顧什麼集團的安全。所謂和平，只是口頭上的門面語，無非只無辜的人民，做了一塲幻夢而已。</p>
<p>歐洲方面各國最擔心的，是德國的復興。英法意俄都希望能維持凡爾賽和的的現狀，不歡喜德國重整軍備，以致威脅和平。但是德國十五年來所念念不忘的，也就是要脫去凡爾賽和的的束縛，恢復戰前的自由。英法兩國看見德國的意志堅决，而且覺得長此束縛一個民族，不令抬頭，也不是永久的辦法。所以二月初旬，兩國會商的結果，是允許廢止凡爾賽和的中限制德國軍備的條欵。但是要德國參加歐洲集團完全的計劃，維持現有狀態，和服從國聯的行動。這個建議，俄國也表示贊成；法意兩國更早經同意。倘然德國不在希特勒的統治之下，或者也有屈就的可能。然而獨裁政治的存在，全靠對外堅强的政策；而且德國在不公開的狀態中，久已準備周密。所以一面用極端審愼的語氣，拒絕全部建議，只允許參加空防恊定。一面就不顧一切，於三月十六日宣佈恢復强迫軍役，並且增加常備軍至三十六師團，五十萬人。這樣一來，歐洲各國就大起恐慌。英國首先抗議，法意等國也接踵而起。法國更要求國聯討論，國聯就正式斥責德國。但是生米已經煮成了熟飯，各國旣然不能改變已成的事實，也只得互相聯合，做些防範的工作了。</p>
<p>倘然意國不在墨索里尼的統治之下，或者這種防範的工作也能有相當的成功。因為英國一個靑年的艾登，法國一個老練的賴伐爾，二人都僕僕風塵，奔走全歐，想要聯結一個極大的集團，包圍德國，使德國雖然有了極强的軍備，也不能衝出這個重圍。艾登遍游蘇俄，波蘭，捷克諸國之後，接着就來了一個斯德萊薩會議。出席的有英法意三國的政治巨頭：英國是首相麥唐納，外相西門；法國是總理佛蘭亭，外長賴伐爾；意國是首相墨索里尼。會議的結果，英意兩國重申他們保障洛迦諾條的的責任；三國還相的反對一切單方面廢棄條的的舉動；倘然奧國的獨立發生危險，就須立刻互相咨詢。這樣一來，歐洲的和平，似乎已經有了着落。只要各國能一心一意對付德國，德國也未必在短時間內就向他國尋釁。况且薩爾區人民投票，德國大獲勝利。希特勒當時就聲明：德國已經收回薩爾，自此卽無其他土地上的企圖。誰知防範德國的集團中間，不久本身就起了裂痕。墨索里尼想攫取菲洲的小國阿比西尼亞，根本上與大不列顚帝國的殖民政策發生衝突，以致引起了滿天的風雲。所有集團和平的希望，早已化為烏有。恐怕德國這個時侯，正在後面竊笑；而且趁此機會，也可以加緊進行整頓軍備的工作。萬一歐洲二决大戰發生，正好成功一個足舉輕重的勢力呢。</p>
<p>在這個時期中，北美洲的兩個大國，對於歐洲各國的問題，不很關心。只自已忙着國內的「新政」問題。美國對於國外的一切糾紛，允其要置身事外。所以把軍火商的營業，竭力加以限止。使那些專門製造殺人利器的廠家，少些挑撥戰爭的機會。幷且美國政府的新政，屢次受最高法院判决，認為不合憲法。政府當局忙於應付，也無暇兼顧與美國利益毫無關係的事情。不過國會通過的白銀政策，要政府不顧世界其他用銀國家的利害，竭力提高銀價。這一件事，倒影響很大，未免擾亂了世界的金融。感受痛苦最深的，就是我們中國。到了年終的時候，世界銀價雖已降低，但是今年國會重開的時候，銀派議員是吾再要强制政府，仍舊抬高，還是一個問題。</p>
<p>南美洲的玻巴兩國，起初還是死命火併。國聯因為巴拉圭不肯接受休戰條件，取消了對於玻璃維亞的軍火禁令。巴拉圭盛怒之下，就在二月二十三日宣布退出國聯，不過後來南美幾個國家，聯同美國，盡力調停，總算在六月中旬休戰。究竟美洲的事情，外邊人是管不了的。</p>
<p>（二）戰爭的開端</p>
<p>歷史上很多因爲個人的野心，而引起千萬人的犧牲。現在墨索里尼對於阿比西尼亞的企圖，就是一個最好的實例。去年交了夏季以後，大半年來全世界所聽見看見的，好像只有一個意阿問題。別的新聞都鼓勵不起人家的興趣。意阿問題當然並不是突如其來的，裏邊有錯綜複雜的背景。意國在歐戰之後，吃了不少的虧，知道是上了英法兩國的大當。墨索里尼精勵圖治，要把一個山窮水盡的意大利，造成一個自給自足的國家。英法兩國不許他在菲洲開拓，他早已心懷不平；總想造就一個機會，把那渴望多年的阿國，一口吞下肚去。去冬華爾華爾邊界上的衝突，也許就是意國故意製造的糾紛，以便有所藉口。果然小事化為大事，到了今天，已經成為不可收拾的局勢。</p>
<p>也許法意兩國事前已經有了默契，意國在歐洲援助法國，對付德國，交換條件，就是法國容許意國在菲洲擴張殖民勢力。甚至當時英國也許稍有諒解，所以墨索里尼敢放胆做去。但是萬不料英德兩國，會成立契的，希特勒雖然一時感冒了些風寒，後來柏林談話，還是舉行。到了六月中旬，英德成立海軍協定，英國已經少了一部份後顧之憂。因此覺得過於讓意國在東菲擴張，將來或者要成為心腹之患。可是那時候意國已經大舉動員，絡續運兵前往東菲；仲裁談判也毫無結果。墨索里尼當然不能半途而廢，於是事態漸漸轉變，由局部的意阿問題，擴大到成功了全世界的和平問題。</p>
<p>這件事情，法國最左右為難。一方面始終不要得罪意國，以致失去了對付德國的一個好友；一方面又不得不維持國聯的威信。阿比西利亞雖然是菲洲一個野蠻國家，也是國聯的一個會員。所以我們看見，自從意阿問題擴大之後，法國就千方百計，設法調解。什麼國聯範圍以外的三國會議啦，國聯範圍以內的五國委員會啦，甚至於最後失敗的英法方案啦都是法國拉攏英國，在可能範圍以內要使墨索里尼滿足他的慾望。然而墨索里尼的慾壑難填，堂堂國聯也不能默無聲息。只待意軍開始進攻，於十月三日轟炸阿杜華，國聯行政院就在七日通過斥責意國破壞國聯會章。幷且一步緊一步的，對意施行軍火和經濟制裁。國聯全體會員，除了匈奧兩國以外，一致批准。意國雖然在初期軍事行動中，佔領了阿杜華，洗去了一八九六年失敗的奇恥；事實上是做了全世界的仇敵，倒也未必是當初料得到的。國聯以前在同樣的情形之下，曾經萎靡不振，束手無策；現在忽然能够挺直了脊骨，做起硬漢來了。要不是英國為了切身的利害關係，硬為國聯撑腰，也不至於如此的。</p>
<p>國聯的制裁辦法，若然只限於軍火和經濟兩方面，實際上也不是在短時期內，就能够使意國屈服的。現代的摩托化戰爭，倘然缺少了油料，就立刻不能進行。意大利所用的油料，全靠別國供給。所以有人建議，實行媒油制裁，以制意國的死命。這個建議提出之後，墨索里尼就說：倘然國聯正式通過油禁，就等於對意宜戰。那麼意國與其受制裁而死，不如出於一戰。以大勢看來，意國到不得已的時候，恐怕眞耍挺而走險的了。法國處於進退維谷之中，當然要設法作最後的調停。賴伐爾竭力說項，果然得到了英國外相霍爾的同意，議定一個所謂英法和平方案，想强制阿國犧牲，以免引起歐洲戰爭。豈知公道尙在人心，這個計劃一經發表，英法兩國的內部，已經起了嚴重的反對。甚至兩國的內閣都幾乎站立不住。勉强挽回，犧牲了霍爾的外相職務，把方案全部取消，纔算渡過難關。現在油禁問題好像只要美國能够合作，或者不久就可以通過國聯了。</p>
<p>也有人說：卽使制裁的範圍不加擴大，意國也要不能支持了。墨索里尼所輕視的阿比西尼亞，竟然表現了極可欽佩的精神毅力。軍事進行到了第二個時期，意國雖然已經佔據了不少土地，阿國却漸漸用了局部襲擊的方法，很有使得意國難於應付的樣子。當然這是過於樂觀的推測，不過弱小民族能有阿國這個英雄的榜樣，也眞足以揚眉吐氣呢！</p>
<p>（三）黯澹的前途</p>
<p>現在一九三五年纔吿結束，一九三六年已經開始，瞻望前途，眞是令人不間接發生的影響，將使全世界都捲入漩渦。英國為謹愼預防起見，已經得到了法國和地中海國家的保證，假使意國攻擊英國的地中海艦隊，各國都肯以軍力為英國後盾。到了那個時候，德國還是袖手旁觀呢？還是傾英傾意？這是法國心中最苦悶的問題。控制世界金融和原料大權的美國，還是置身事外呢？還是趁勢牟利？倘然美國一般唯利是圖的商人，竟不顧政府的中立政策，仍舊和交戰國家往來；政府是吾能够卸去責任？現在國聯所以不能立刻進行油禁，也是這個關係。</p>
<p>戰爭的開始，是已經追在眉睫了！各國擴張軍備的行動，當然是日趨積極：你也演習，我也演習；你也造艦，我也造艦；飛機大砲的數目，儘管增加；常備軍役的時期，儘管延長。第一决歐戰的創痛還仍在各國人民的記憶之中，第二决的流血，又誰能遏阻？英國幅員遼闊，未免有顧此失彼的危險。因此竭力拉攏美國，想以盎格魯撒克遜同種的關係，聯合海上的勢力，抵抗他國的侵犯。兩國朝野人士，很多贊成締結切實的協定，以為安定世界和平的勢力。這種結合，對於遠東也大有關係。不過不在本文的範圍之內，所以連正在進行之中的倫敦海軍會議，也略而不談了。</p>
<h3>開歲後工作方針</h3>
<p>— 吳鼎昌</p>
<p>各報新年特刋徵稿於不佞，當此初負行政實際責任之時，公私栗六，不暇盡述所懷，爰就感想所及，略為一言。</p>
<p>本人此决出長實業，國事如斯，萬端待理，益覺責任重大，『為政不在多言』，祗須埋頭苦幹。且國民政府之建設計劃，本為整個姿態的展開，實業建設不過其中一部份，而在現階叚我國情勢之下，因種種關係，計劃與實行之間，每每不免有若干之距離，至少實施方面，不能不受環境之影響，故關於空洞計劃方面不欲多言。</p>
<p>我國國營事業，寥若晨星，什九衰敗，民營事業日益不振，四伏危機，國人怵於經濟破產之來臨，多誤認行政當局應全負辦理企業之任務，其實本部乃實業行政機關，非各種企業均須本部自行創辦，蓋行政機關之任務，端在以系統的政治機構，對國營事業民營事業為有力之指導與推進。是故不佞以為橫的方面，如全國經濟委員會，建設委員會及其他機關等，與本部性質雖有若干點類似，然事業推進，重在分工合作，各機關所辦事業，本部應不吝以合作或分劃之精神，分明責任，避免重複，决不斤為權限等無益之爭，藉收殊途同歸之效。縱的方面，如各省政府之建設事業，自當予以便利，力助其成，决不爲部營省營之爭。人民自營大小企業，更當减其痛苦，予以保障，並助其發展，本部决不與民爭利。本部應負責任，祗在實業行政，盡指導推進之責而已。至關於一般的基本工作，與夫本部已辦之事業，如中國經濟年鑑及各省實業誌之刋行，一方面收集各種統計資料，一方面分省實地調查，此項基本工作乃一切建設研究上之先决問題，為現代任何國家所重視，我國土地廣闊，匪共未淸，不免有若干之困難，然必當努力完成，如酒精廠，造紙廠，機器廠，硫酸铔廠及工業農業試騐實騐所等。或由官商合辦，或由官營，或已完成，或正在進行中，均當本原來計劃，切實推行。其他各種新建設，則當視客觀需要與主觀力量之許可，努力邁進。</p>
<p>不飪來自民間，自信對於民間疾苦，尙為明白，深信我國民營事業之不能發展，民族資本之不能抬頭，國際之影響當然嚴重，而內在的原因，亦所在多有，吾人雖不能謂用政府短時期之力量，將民衆痛苦，可完全解除。但深覺行政上，對民營事業，苟能隨時注重此點，則民間必將受益不少，而政府與民間之關係，亦必日臻密切，實民營事業與民族資本發展之契機，故對於茲事，將來必當求具體的實現。今當歲首，謹略述不佞今後開始工作之微意以獻。</p>
<h3>我們對於國家的責任</h3>
<p>— 盧作孚</p>
<p>中國人應得認淸楚自己的責任，不僅是因為國家怎樣危急，應得怎樣趕快救她，祇耍救到不亡就可以吿一段落了，祇耍救到壓追我們的力量稍稍緩和便認為可以不亡了。這樣危急一回去救一回，便一直可以救到亡完的時候，絕不是辦法。</p>
<p>我們的責任絕不是救亡，而是將一個國家經營到像一個國家——像一個現代的國家，還不够，應得經營到比現代好的國家還要好。這樣的工作是積極的，是沒有止境的。如果眞能够把這一個在世界上人口最多的國家經營得比別的國家更好的時候誰還能亡這一個最大而又最好的國家呢，祇要求我們好到不亡別的國家，便可將這一個混亂的國際扭轉成功另外一個局面了，豈特效果可以救亡？直可以救世界呵！反之，如果我們長時間不能將國家經營好，總有人會亡我們的，縱沒有甲，也會有乙，亦沒有救的辦法罷！</p>
<p>中國應得經營成功一個現代的國家，或比現代的國家更好，責任不祇在當局身上，不應祇責備當局。如果我們每一個人都祇知道替自己個人打主意，替自己家庭打主意，替自己有關係的親戚鄰里朋友打主意，為甚麼偏偏責備當局去替國家打主意。一個社會裏面的人的行動，總是相互影響的，總是大體不會隔得太遠的。當局祇能提倡替國家打主意，提倡亦不一定需耍當局，結果是需要辦到整個國家裏每一個人都替國家打主意，善後任何當局不得不替國家打主意，然後國家有人去經營，而且有整個國家的人去經營。我們須知道我們心目中沒有中國，沒有要求將中國經營好，倒讓壓迫我們的國家的舉國上下心目中都有了中國，而且都想經營中國去適應他們的需要。我們更須知道將中國經營好，是中國人絕對需要的，不僅是對國家負責任，在這國際局面很紛亂，經濟文化關係很密切的世界上，也是對世界負責任。</p>
<p>在現代這一個世界上，要將國家經營好，要每一個人都能够將國家經營好，必須懸出三個口號：</p>
<p>第一，我們的知識耍有世界那樣大。我們要在整個世界上找出好的國家和好的方法來。須知道落後的國家最幸福，如果眞正努力的話，直可超越了先進的一切國家。因為我們取得的方法乃至於一切工具都是他們最後發明的，最後發明的，就是最有效率的。凡他們失敗的經過，我們都不再去經過；凡他們不忍廢棄的東西，我們都不再去使用。我們必須取得這最後的機會，卽是必須尋找出一切世界上失敗的經過和最後的發明，所以我們的知識必須有世界那樣大</p>
<p>第二，我們的問題要有中華民國那樣大。今天以前我們把自己個人或自己家庭放在一切的前面，不管他們任何地方都在替自己個人或自己家庭打算。今天以後，我們應把國家放在一切的前面，在任何地方都得替國家打算。不管我們是在政治上，在敎育事業上，在經濟事業上，其努力都是在整個國家的要求上，都是要造起整個國家的運動，要使影響及於整個的國家。</p>
<p>第三，我們的工作却祇須當前正在做着的那樣大。許多人都有誤解，以為我們要做國家的事，才可以帮助國家。其實每一個人不管是農夫，或是工人，不管是醫生，或是敎師，祇要是在中華民國裏，都是中華民國的事，祇要眞正努力，便也從自己地位上帮助了國家，而在且職業以外還很可以去做許多造起影響國家的事。祇要我們從中華民國去找出問題，從世界上去找出解决問題的可靠辦法，便儘有我們解决問題的機會。</p>
<p>申報之要求進步非常顯著。日刋之外，現在更要發行週刋。我們相信他們的要求是隨着整個世界進步，促成中華民國進步，促成每一個人在自己所在的地位上進步。我們相信他們必能够隨時介紹世界的知識，提出中華民國的問題，促起每一個人從自己所在的地位努力設法帮助中華民國解决問題去。</p>
<h3>中國勞工運動之前途</h3>
<p>— 朱學範</p>
<p>自從十八世紀產業革命在英國發動，機器工業還用着牠的優越地位，使手工業受着致命的打擊，於是手工業工人，不得不拋棄了手工生產，而找尋他們的僱主；僱主們靠着機器囊括手工生產者的利潤，又從每一個勞工人中，剝削其生產本能所應得的酬報，而累集在自己的一身，他們就成為一種不勞而獲的坐享。經濟學家昂格思說：「生產器具的主人，把生產器具工作的結果，都當作他自己的生產，至於別人的勞動，就置諸度外；這個矛盾，就是給新式生產制以資本家搶掠性質，也就是包含今日社會傾突的種子。」這已够說明了產業革命成功後，資本家便把資本制度做工具，直接榨取勞動羣衆的生活資源，來灌溉資本主義的滋長。資本主義愈成功，勞動者的被榨取亦愈多，結果資本家以少數人擁有鉅量的資財，而使多數的勞動階級，陷入於飢寒交迫之中。所以產業革命的成功，一方面促進了資本主義的完成，另一方面也促成了勞動羣衆的階級自覺，因此在十八世紀的下葉，僱主與勞工，在歐美已不斷地鬥爭，形成勞資階級的對立，一直到現在，這種對立的形勢，還沒法子把牠消除。</p>
<p>中國是生產落後的國家，根本誤不到資本主義，但自歐戰以後，機器生產事業，也逐漸在國內各大都市間活躍，但資本主義的目的，是在博取利潤，博取利潤重要的條件有兩種：一種是財產私有，一種是自由競爭，因為財產私有，所以他不惜犧牲衆人的利益，充作獨占的利益。因為是自由競爭，所以他只要能力所及，就不管手段，與對於人類的同情；他總是利用他優勢的生產工具以征服一切；因此，他們已把剝削勞工，當做營利的必然手段：勞工的工資必極度低抑，勞工的工作時間，必盡量增加，他們已忘記社會經濟的構造，乃為生產關係總和的表現形式。那末，勞資雖互為社會經濟構造不可缺少的一環，而中問顯有主奴的分野，在生產關係上，早已立於不平等的地位。所以中國雖是生產落後的國家，但在機器生產出現以後，企業家也同歐美一樣向着財　私有，和自由競爭的兩條路上走，　共通底目的還是資本主義。正合着中國的一句老話：「天下老鴉一般黑。」所以中國雖還沒有到達資本主義的完成期，但也有着「具體而微」的模樣。因之，中國勞工運動的產生，亦復是依循着自然的進展而活躍。</p>
<p>以前政府尙未有勞工法的制定，機械業工人的工作時間，可以由廠方任意規定；據當時的調查，凡為國家設立的工塲，工人每日勞動時間，至少九小時，多至十二小時；資本家設立的工塲，每日勞動時間，至少十四小時，多至十六小時。同時他們所得的工資，每日的自四毛至八毛，最低的自一毛半至三毛。工人耗着高無可高的工作時間，却受着低無可低的工資。於是我們的勞動大衆自然感到不滿足，感到憤慨，為要促醒資方，以覓取人類的共同生活，就不得不用罷工的手段做武器；像這種運動，最初却發生在英國，後來歐洲大陸也一致採用，到那時候，中國的勞工，也拿過來做資本家向勞工無理剝削及侮辱時的抵抗工具。這也可以說是中國勞工運動的濫觴。</p>
<p>這裏得順便說一說罷工運動過去史實的必要。因為我們要明瞭中國勞動界奮鬥的史蹟，則以下幾件事占着最重要的地位。其犖犖大者，如民八上海日華紗廠為工資問題，吃虧過大，以致宣布罷工；民九夏季，工人因米價飛漲，蘇州·杭州·上海·香港的工人紛起罷工，結果或由資方開辦平糶，或由資方增加工資，工人也就一致復工。民十二年一月五日，京漢路全路二萬工人，組織總工會，二月一日開成立大會，因當局橫加摧殘，通電全國，發表罷工宣言，提出五項要求。這幾决罷工，工人總算得到相當的勝利，社會上也認識了勞工的力量。民十四，我們工運史上最壯烈慘痛的五卅案件，更在那時候發生，因之上海開始罷工·罷市·罷課，罷工人數達十五萬六千餘人，各業工人，以及租界上交通工人，甚至各洋行及其他西人住宅中服役的西崽，亦加入罷工。時上海消息所播，各地亦紛起響應，南京·北京·九江·靑島·港·粵·等地，皆一致向帝國主義者示威；此回工人運動，牽動之廣，堅持之久，為前所未有</p>

<h3>民國二十四年出版界回顧</h3>
<p>— 一平</p>
<p>出版事業是一國文化的風雨表。人們要考察「文明的優秀的」德意志自從希特勒上台後文明到怎樣，和「野蠻的低劣的」蘇聯究竟野蠻到如何，往往從各該國裏搬出一大堆的數目字，說那是衰第了，這是蓬勃着。</p>
<p>中國的文化事業怎樣了呢？我們從出版事業這一個角去瞥視一下，在一切都要刷上新的年頭來回顧去年的動靜，或者也能得個粗淺的印象吧。</p>
<p>可是在資本制度的國家內，出版事業也和別的事業一樣，受着商品的網的限制的。書是文化品，同時也是商品。於是這被一部分人視爲神聖的文化事業，其動向也不得不跟着市塲情况而同進退了。</p>
<p>這是去年一年間出版物的分類統計：</p>
<p>看了上表的總計一項，簡直不能相信，去年出版界一年的努力，僅只有二千餘種的出版物，全部價格連大部的古書在內，僅只三四千元。希特勒的德國雖經盡力的壓制輿論，出版的統計數字正在一年年的跌落，但出版物的數量，還在二萬種以上。</p>
<p>上表是去年的初版新書，重版書不在內，還有敎科書書也除外。大部的古書槪依預的價計算，時間有期限，付欵有分期，書有精平本的，概依第一期整付和平裝的價目計算，就是依最低的價格。但這大部古書的一項內仍佔全體百分之四三·二八，假如出版業所出的書籍，視作讀者們對文化事業的投資，那末我們出版界的吸收游資的着眼點，是在翻印古書了。自從開明利用現代印刷術的精良方法，極經濟地刋印了我國史部典籍的二十五史以來，大部的翻印古書，粗製濫造的競賣，以至倒閉詐欺，輿論界指責着，有識人士嘆息着，眞不能不使我們惋惜了。</p>
<p>文學和社會科學總是佔較多的數量的，其中社會科學因為包括的門類較多，如政治外交敎育法律等都經包含在內，所以數目顯得龐大。而自然科學及應用技術在充滿一片建設聲的中國似乎在總的比重中還嫌太少。說到這兩門的出版物，假如純粹從商業觀點來說，通俗的自然科學書是銷行並不差的。專門的論文和報吿刋行者大都為學術機關，在文化價値上這應該是很高的，但是刋行者旣無心使刋物普遍化，著作者的專家們也多用文言，甚至直接用外國文寫。專家的修養上是沒有文學趣味的。同時這些專門刋物，據說是不甚希望國內的一般人也能讀的，倒是在出版後向外國的學術機關去交換的。得到中國工程師學會第一個榮譽的工程師侯德榜，他的名著製碱工業一書是用英文寫成，在美國出版，中國除上海的別發洋行外，恐怕他處無法可以購到。</p>
<p>雜誌刋物在二十四年初是順着雜誌年的餘波，在所謂「第二雜誌年」的口號之下，總算掙扎了些時，終於跟着二十四年而衰落。雜色刋物被淘汰了，乘下依然是雜誌年以前的有學術和社會價値的刋物，另一些是有着津貼的機關刋物。這使幽默派的三大刋物也會倒去其一，一個專營雜誌業的老闆也改營叢書，但仍是終於生「病」「退職」了。</p>
<p>據說去年是「小報年」，但我們僅看到不多幾種編得較以前進步些的小報而已。</p>
<p>開明書店在去年內所出各書中除敎科書和大部書之外，也出了八十七種書，內中以中等程度的讀物佔多數，茲分類如下：</p>
<p>照上表。除了史地類外，自然科學類的書佔了次多的百分數。在一般科學書中，至少有下列幾種可供靑年諸君一讀的：</p>
<p>自然科學中的天文學是向來爲人視爲與人生無直接關係的科學，對於這個錯誤觀念的改正，曾出了下列各書：</p>
<p>關於語文方面，也特別爲中學生的國文方而出了幾種，佔了較高的百分數。其中除文心一書巳得全國靑年的熱烈歡迎外，國文百八課的刋印，尤給目前中學的語文敎學上開闢了一條簇新的道路。而靑年英語叢書也給中學靑年學習外國語不少的幫助。</p>
<h3>開明書店與新文學</h3>
<p>— 歐嘉</p>
<p>開明書店當初創的時候，是以專出新文學書籍的姿態而出現的。但近年來因牠的營業逐漸發展，於是牠的出版的範圍也逐漸廣大。最近更因努力於中小學敎科書及補充讀物和大部頭的巨著（若敎育年鑑辭通十三經索引六十種曲二十五史二十五史補編等）之刋行，一般人以爲牠對於新文學齊籍巳厭棄了。其實這是不對的。牠决不願抹煞牠過去的光榮，牠在這卽將到臨的新的一年內，重新又要在這方而努力了！</p>
<p>看罷！今天是一月一日，牠第一次就送出了三本精美的散文集。茅盾葉紹鈞更丐尊三位是現代中國的散文能手。我們不妨引用當代批評家的話在這里。</p>
<p>郁達夫先生說：</p>
<p>「茅盾……閱世深了，所以行文每不忘社會。他的觀察的周到，分析的淸楚，是現代散文中最有實用的一種寫法……中國若要進步，若要使文章和實生活發生關係，則像茅盾那樣的散文作家，多一個好一個。」他又說：</p>
<p>『葉紹鈞風格謹嚴，思想每把握得住現實，所以他所寫的，不問是小說，是散文，都令人有脚踏實地，造决不苟的感觸。所作的散文雖則不多，而他所特有的風致，郤早在短短的幾篇文字裏具備了：我以爲一般的高中學生，要取作散文的模範，當以葉紹鈞氏的作品最爲適宜。』</p>
<p>阿英先生也說：</p>
<p>『在中國的小品文活動中，在努力的探索看這條路的，除茅盾魯迅而外，似乎還沒有第三個人。」又說：</p>
<p>「葉紹鈞的小品文的特色，我很想用『寧靜淡泊』四個字來說明。在小品文的內容上，固然表現着『寧靜淡泊』的精神，就是在表現的形式上，也是同樣的反映着一種『淸淡雋永』的風趣。感情是豐富的，但他用一種極其微妙的方法表出之，如事物上蒙上一層輕紗，是那麽淡淡的，又是那麽深深地襲人。他的文字是輕靈的，而又是那麽的細膩縝密地。」</p>
<p>至於夏丐尊先生，因爲他的文章從來沒收集起來出過單行本，所以很少有人批評到。然而他的觀察的細緻，思想的敏感，文字的樸茂，是素來有聲於時的。</p>
<p>這三本集子，在風格和思想方面，雖各不相同，然而也有一個共通的特點，那就是可以作爲學者的楷模。如果初高中學生要在文字技術方面學習一些方法，那麽我毫不遲疑地把這三本書推薦給他們。</p>
<p>話又得說回來這三木書將是開明書店本年度文學新書的先鋒，巴金，靳以，沈從文，茅盾諸位的小說，以及別的作家的新著，也將一本本地呈顯在讀者的面前！</p>
<h3>大題小做</h3>
<p>— 茅盾</p>
<p>——速寫與隨筆自序——</p>
<p>昔年在日本西京，曾因「賣豆腐的哨子」，「紅葉」，「櫻花」等等，而寫了幾篇隨筆。當時國內文壇尙無所謂「小品年」，而「性靈」「個人筆調」之說，亦未有人大聲疾呼。我是向來不大懂得「性靈」道個微妙的東西，而且素來喜歡發點議論，所以「賣豆腐的哨子」等篇雖然是偶書所見，仍舊充溢著「俗」的議論。</p>
<p>後來有二年多，我沒有什麽隨筆之類寫出來。不寫，因爲有別的事情分去了我的工夫。</p>
<p>「一二八」以後，我常在自由談上投稿。自由談所需，正是五六百字的短文；然而自由談到底是「軟性讀物」，不宜於訛敎式的短文。於是我所寫的，便不得不是又像隨筆又像雜感——乃至有時簡直竟像評論。</p>
<p>同時東方雜誌復刋後也因「文藝欄」地盤太窄之故，需要隨筆一類的短文。我開始投的一篇，就是題爲我們這文壇的，實在完完全全是議論。不過一個作家有時旣不能不像一個廠家似的接受外邊的「定貨」，那他也就不能不照着「定單」去製造，這結果便是冥屋，秋之公園，公墓等等。</p>
<p>到一九三三年的七月，不知不覺已經積有四十多篇了；有一家書店要我給一本稿子，我就拿這些來充數，胡亂題了個茅盾散文集的名字。</p>
<p>在這散文集的自序中，我有這樣一段話；</p>
<p>「從來有「小題大做」之一說，現在我們也常常看見近乎「小題大做」的文章。不過我以爲隨筆之類光景是倒過來「大題小做」的。</p>
<p>「在這時代，「大題目」多得很。也有些人常在那里「大題小做」，把天大的事說得稀鬆平常，呌大家放下一百念四個心靜靜地去「等候五十年」。我的所謂「大題小做」不是這麽一種作法。</p>
<p>「我的意思是：大題不許大做，就只好小做做了。</p>
<p>「而這「做」字就很難。太尖銳，當然通不過；太含渾，就未免無聊；太嚴肅。就要流於呆板；而太幽默呢，又恐怕讀者以爲常眞是一樁笑話。</p>
<p>「所以就我自己的經騐而論，則隨筆產生的過程是第一得題難，第二做得恰好難。雖然因爲被「逼」著也寫了這麽幾十篇，而每决都是一身大汗，其不足觀，自不待言。</p>
<p>「不過特殊的時代常常會產生特殊的文體。而且並不是大家都像我那樣不濟事的，眞眞出色的「大題小做」的隨筆近來巳經產生了不少。細心的讀者自然會咀嚼，不必我在這裏多說。</p>
<p>上面這一段我的話，是「九三三年七月寫的；其時「小品年」「尙無影蹤；「性靈」之說，市面上亦未見樣品；我把隨筆解釋爲「大題小做」的文章，初非爲了論爭，亦不過沿襲我往常之所信罷了。</p>
<p>等到旣有了「小品年，」而且有了「性靈」，有了「個人筆調」之說，我還是因爲「需要「而大膽寫着隨筆。其間我也會嘗試找找「性靈」這微妙的東西，不幸「性靈」始終不肯和我打交道；但我郤也以爲「個人筆調」是有的，而且大槪不能不有的，只是此所謂「個人筆調」倒和「性靈」無關，而爲各個人的環境敎養所形成，所產生；我的隨筆寫來寫去不脫「俗」的議論的腔調，恐怕就是一例罷！</p>
<p>到了一九三四年十月，我所寫的隨筆居然又可以集成一册了；於是就以話匣子這名兒在良友文學叢書內估居了一册。</p>
<p>其實在散文集和話匣子裏大部分的東西，雖然我稱之爲隨筆，實非通常所謂隨筆而是評論體的雜感，本年（一九三五）上半年，……或者是一九三四下半年，文壇上發生了「雜文問題」的時候，有好幾位先生指出「雜文之產生與發展，是因爲有特殊的社會需要，」這使我想起了我在散文集自序所說的「特殊的時代常常會產生特殊的文體」這句話，而且頗自喜沒有說錯。但是在散文集自序寫下以後，我一天一天的自覺得「不濟事，」我覺得我寫的雜感太像硬梆梆的短評了。</p>
<p>從太白發刋以後，我就打算……借郁達夫先生的一句話；「利用他的所長而遺棄他的所短」（見新文學大係散文二集序）我打算寫寫通常所謂隨筆，以及那時很風行的速寫，一年以來，不知不覺也寫了不少；在太白和申報月刋上發表。</p>
<p>可是雖在「利用」我的「所長，」成績還是不好。</p>
<p>這算是我所寫的隨筆（照這詞的通常的意義）的選集……或第一次的整理。</p>
<h3>二十五史人名索引序</h3>
<p>— 章錫琛</p>
<p>二十五史爲我國史冊之總結集，所函人名，浩如烟海；或一人而名號岐出，或兩人而隔世同名，甚有並時同名而了不相涉者。不有條分粽貫之方，讀史者將何從探索古人於查冗蒼茫之際，以爲尙友之資乎？淸人在輝祖氏有鑒於此，遂有史姓韻編之作。殺靑甫竟，譽徧士林。蓋操炬火以導夫先路，宜乎其爲世稱重矣。顧其爲書也，止限於二十四史，且不載帝王后妃及外國諸傳人名；其排列方式，又一以時代爲序，隔世同名者，卽無繇彙列，校其同異。而編次悉依舊有之韻目，在今日亦頗感檢查匪便。同人竊不自揆，於輯印二十五史之頃，卽發凡起例，爲製人名索引，藉彌此憾。通功合作，無間寒暑；而盧芷芬周振甫兩君之力允多。書成，爰誌其緣起如此。至編决排列之方，拾遺補闕之跡，具如凡例，茲不贅。</p>

<h3>潔本「紅樓夢」導言（節錄）</h3>
<p>— 茅盾</p>
<p>「我嘗以爲如有名手將石頭記瑣屑的故事盡量刪削，單留下善寫人情的部分，可以算中國近代語的文學作品中代表著作。」—陳獨秀</p>
<p>曹雪芹寫這紅樓夢有什麽用意呢？紅樓夢開卷第一回裏說：「作者自云曾歷過一番夢幻之後，故將眞事隱去，而借『通靈』說此石頭記一書也。故曰「甄士隱」云云。但書中所記何事何人？自己又云：今風塵碌碌，一事無成，忽念及當日所有之女子，一一細考較去，覺其行止見識皆川我之上。我堂堂鬚眉，誠不若彼裙釵；我實愧則有餘，悔又無益，大無可如何之日也。當此日，欲將已往所賴天恩祖德錦衣紈袴之時，飫甘　肥之日，背父母敎育之恩，負師友規訓之德，以致今日一技無成半生潦倒之罪，編述一集，以吿天下知我之負罪固多，然閨閣中歷歷有人，萬不可因我之不肖自護己短，一並使其泯滅也。……我雖不學無文，又何妨用假語村言敷衍出來，亦可使閨閣昭傳，復可破一時之悶，醒同人之目，不亦宜乎？故曰「賈雨村」云云。……』</p>
<p>現在我們知道了曹雪芹的身世以後，便覺得這一段話明明是作者的『著書緣起』，書中何事何人，無非是作者的生活經騐而已。書中人物姓各自然是『賈』（假）的，自然也影射着若干眞的人，可是這些眞的人無非是作者『半世親見親聞』的幾個女子。書中的『賈寳玉』明明卽是作者的化身；又有一個『甄寶玉』，也是作者假設來提醒讀者的。紅樓夢只是一部自敍傳性質的小說！</p>
<p>曹雪芹以前，沒有人做過自敘傳性質的小說。曹雪芹雖然勇敢地創始了，却也不敢彰明較著說是自敍；所以他在第一回中呑吐含糊假託了空空道人和「石頭」上的故事。因爲他的第一回語意呑吐含糊，而中國向來又沒有自敍傳性質的小說，於是從前研究紅樓夢的人總是轉彎抹角地去用心思：或謂此書爲政治小說，有民族主養的排滿思想；或謂賈寳玉射影康熙朝宰相明珠的兒子納蘭成德；或謂此書『全爲淸世祖與董那妃而作。』在這裏，我們不及細述，讀者可看胡適紅樓夢考證中對於諸說的辯駁。</p>
<p>可是一部自敍傳性質的小說總也有一個中心思想，紅樓夢的中心思想是什麽呢？作者在開卷第一回中雖然表示了深自懺悔的意思，可是他全書是寫婚姻不自由的痛苦。紅樓夢前八十回（卽曹雪芹的原作，）一方面展開了賈寳玉的『三角戀愛，』一方面也就寫了婚姻不自由的痛苦。不過曹雪芹仍舊不敢明明白白攻擊婚姻不自由的禮敎，所以他又造出『通靈寳玉』和『靈芝草』的神話，以爲掩飾。再者，像他那樣生長在富貴家庭中的人，要反抗而不得的時候，會自然而然的逃避到『宿命論』裏去，所謂『木石姻緣』也就是他躱避的意識的表現。</p>
<p>紅樓夢以前，中國沒有自敍傳性質的小說，這話，前面已經說過了。水滸，自然也是一部偉大的傑作，——在社會意義上，比紅樓夢還要偉大些；但是水滸這書，是同一題材下的許多民間故事，經過了一二百年的長時間的發展，然後『形成』了的。水滸，嚴格說來，不是『個人的著作。』紅樓夢是不同的。牠是『個人著作』，是作者的生活經騐，是一位作家有意地應有了寫實主義的作品。所以從中國小說發達的過程上看來，紅樓夢是一個新階段的開始。可惜乾隆初年紅樓夢『出世』以後，雖然那時的文人驚賞牠的新奇，傳鈔不已，雖然有不少人續作，然而沒有一個人依了紅樓夢的『寫實的精神』來描寫當時的世態。所以紅樓夢本身所開始的中國小說發達史上的新階段，不幸也就『及身而終』了。</p>
<p>其次紅樓夢是寫『男女私情』的。紅樓夢以前，描寫男女私情的小說已經很多了，可是大都把男人作爲主體，女子作爲附屬；寫女子的窈窕溫柔無非襯托出男子的『豔福不淺』罷了。把女子作爲獨立的個人來描寫，也是紅樓夢創始的。賈寳玉和許多『才子佳人小說』裏的主人公不同的地方，就在賈寳玉不是什麽『風流敎主』，『護花使者』，而是同受舊禮敎壓迫的可憐人見。紅樓夢中那些女子都是活生生的人，都是作者觀察得的客觀人物，而不是其他『才子佳人』小說裏那些作者想像中的『美人兒』。這一點，也是曹雪芹所開始的『新階段』，但後來人並沒能够繼續發展。</p>
<p>又次，紅樓夢的『技巧』也是後來人不曾好好兒發揚光大的。紅樓夢寫『人物』的個性，力避介紹式的敍述而從瑣細的動作中表現出一個活的林黛玉來。讀者對於黛玉的品貌性格是跟着書中故事的發展一點一點凝集起來直到一個完全的黛玉生根在腦子裏，就像向來認識似的。紅樓夢中幾個重要人物都是用的這個寫法。水滸的人物描寫也是好極的，也是用了這個寫法的；但是水滸中人物的個性在接連幾『回』的描寫中就已經發展完畢，以後這人物再出現時就是『固定』的了，不能再有增添例如武松，如魯達，在專寫他們那幾回書中，他們是活的，但在武松魯達合傳的那一回書裏，這兩個人就算沒有什麽精采。所以水滸寫一百八人的個性（其實不寫了三十幾個）是寫完了一個再寫一個，故到後來這些已經寫過的人物再出現時，就呆板板地沒有精采。紅樓夢則不然。紅樓夢裏許多人物都是跟着故事的發展而發展的，儘管前面寫王熙鳳已經很多，你自以爲已經認識這位鳳辣子了，然而後來故事中牽着鳳姐兒的地方，你還是愛讀，還是覺得這鳳姐始終是活的。</p>
<p>紅樓夢是沒有扭揑做作的。全書只寫些飲食男女之事，並沒有驚人的大事，但同類性質的書往往扭揑做作出許多『驚人之筆』，希望刺激讀者的感情，結果反令人肉麻。紅樓夢並不賣弄這樣的小巧。牠每回害的結尾處只是平淡地收住，並沒留下一個『悶葫蘆』引誘讀者去看牠的下一回書。但是讀者却總要往下看，不能中止。紅樓夢每一回書中問也沒有整齊的『結構』。牠只是一段一段的飲食男女細事，但是愈瑣細愈零碎，我們所得的印象郤愈深，就好像置身在瑣細雜亂的賈府的生活中。『整齊的結構』自然是好的，不過硬做出來的『整齊的結構』每每使人讀後感到不自然，覺得是在『看小說』，覺得『不眞』。</p>
<p>陳獨秀先生曾說：「我嘗以爲如有名手將石頭記　屑的故事盡量刪削，單留下善寫人情的部分，可以算中國近代語的文學作品中代表著作」。（見亞東版紅樓夢陳序）在下何敢僭稱「名手」，但對於陳先生這個提議，郤感到興味，不免大着膽子，唐突那紅樓夢一遭兒。</p>
<p>總計前後刪削，約佔全書五分之二。旣然刪削過了，章回分界就不能依照原樣，所以再一决大膽，重訂章回，並改題了『回目』。</p>
<p>研究紅樓夢的人很可以去讀原書。但是中學生諸君倘使想從紅樓夢學一點文學的技巧，則此部節本雖然未能盡善，威許還有點用處。</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>，尤可注意的：這一次工人罷工的對象，絕不是爭執本身階級利益，而他們的目標：是打倒帝國主義。完全是民族精神的表現，此不僅是中國工運史上的光榮的一頁，也是中國民族運動史上最有價値的事跡。後來國民軍大舉北伐，軍决杭州，全滬工人急起同盟罷工，罷工人數達五十餘萬人，使聯軍後方受到重大的威脅，聯軍知民意所在，已覺魄奪勢窮！國民軍因得旁助，終能完成北伐的使命。此回罷工，在政治上，所受的影響甚大，在工運史上可與五卅一案，後先輝映，回想十六年以前的幾次罷工，勞工運動顯見有思想上的變動，先起的罷工，幾乎全爲勞工自身的階級利益，到後來勞動界除爲階級利益而奮鬥以外，更進而爲國家民族的利益而奮鬥，此種過去奮鬥歷史的一般，足以安慰我勞工的本身。</p>
<p>待到革命軍奠都南京，中國的勞工運動，可以說已完全成了前期的使命。勞工在社會上，已得到了相當的地位，在民族國家的奮鬥史上，也建樹了相當的功績。但是一九二九年，世界經濟發生大變動後，各國都受到不景氣影響，莫不用軍事政治經濟力量向我國進攻，中國工商界也處於極困難的地位，最近二年來，此種形態更見加深，農村破產，工廠倒閉，失業者滿坑滿谷，水旱災荒，紛至沓來。上海是中國經濟的重心所寄，亦是勞動階級的大本營，現在工人到處感到失業的痛苦，卽以去年上半年六個月之中而論，上海失業工人就增加到十二萬七千多人。茲附表如左：</p>
<p>上海市失業工人增加調查統計表（民國二十四年，</p>
<p>照上表所舉工人失業的原因，都爲着工廠的停業與减工，這就可以看到上海廠商所遭受的境遇，如果勞動界仍要拿出鬥爭的姿態去對付僅存奄奄一息的民族工業，這豈不是替帝國主義造機會麽？同時廠商當亦不致於藉故關門，以使工商業遭受空前的浩刧，同遇着無謂的犧牲。惟幸上海的勞資階級，都能本着恊調的精神，互相忍耐，過渡這個難關；所以我們不但不願意我們這些可敬愛的工友們，輕舉妄動，自尋煩惱，同時對於工友們的保障，我們更不肯放鬆。總期我們勞動界能得到工人實惠的利益，此外我以爲對於勞工福利事業，如勞工保險，勞工敎育，勞工衛生，及勞工消費合作等事業，也願與熱心運工的同志，共同努方。而所以團結勞工，聯合戰錢，允爲我勞工當前的念務。同時更希望中國的勞工運動，能與世界勞工運動發生聯繫的關係；只有世界上勞動階級的切實合作，才能奠定世界眞正的和平基礎。我們要把世界上占着大多數的中國貧苦勞工，介紹到各國工運裏去，以尋求世界勞動共同的福利。</p>
<p>要之，中國勞工的前期運動，已經吿一段落。以後我們更當發揮工人階級的本能，而謀眞正的利益；我們不能忘記做復興民族的更偉大的運動。亦惟我們勞動階級最足以担當此種使命。要除去國家自由平等的障礙，亦惟有努力於工運，方足以奏效，我們勞動階級，在國家無事之秋，是站在民族工業的前錢，以與資本主義者奮鬥。而爲發展國民經濟之前鋒。一到了國家非常時期，我們又站在民族自决的前錢，以與帝國主義者奮鬥，而爲復興民族之大衆的集團。我們爲着公理，爲着國家的自由平等，爲着民族的前途，更爲着人類的和平，我們不惜任何犧牲，不辭任何艱鉅，我們是永遠地努力永遠地奮鬥！永遠地邁進！</p>
<h3>一九三五年世界與中國經濟之檢討</h3>
<p>— 穆藕初</p>
<p>昔太史公作史記，搜采春秋戰國秦漢農工商販政富之佚聞與其所以爲人生災禍幸福之大本大原者成貨殖列傳，余嘗謂爲千古創見，即此一端，遷史已足不朽。蓋其於社會人羣之治亂興衰獨能洞見幽渺，不托空言以妄事褒貶，其言曰：</p>
<p>「……故待農而食之，虞而出之，工而成之，商而通之，此髯有政敎發微期會哉？人各任其能，竭其力，以得所欲。故物賤之徵貴，貴之微賤，各勸其業，樂其事，若水之趨下，曰夜無休時，不召而自來，不求而民出之，豈非道之所符，而自然之騐耶？」</p>
<p>由是言之，則人民「謠俗被服飲食奉生送死之具」必待農虞工商之力以濟之，而不可以獨力求一也：農虞工商，經濟之事，貴賤微逐，日夜無休，不可以人力而逆泥之二也，此等現象不惟非老子所謂「至治之極，鄰國相望，鷄狗之聲相聞，民各甘其食，美其服，安其俗，樂其業，至老死不相往來」所能範圍，且以之符於道而騐於自然三也。夫人旣各任其能，竭其力以得所欲，則由近而之遠，由簡而之繁，由質而之文，如水之就下，故老死不相往來之烏託邦終不可得，而今日之輪鐵海空，通五洲若戶庭，聯萬國於一室，人之所欲旣什百於往昔，而其任能，竭力以求之也，亦什百於往昔，於是盈絀之競，利害之爭，益樊然並起，其演爲爭奪，流爲攻戰，爲禍之烈，至今而極！今者吾國國勢陵替，胡馬縱橫，巨人不武，侏儒跳梁，述往事以思將來，則一九三六年之中國與世界前途，將於一九三五年之中國與世界已事卜之，而其癥結允在於經濟。且就今歲中外經濟變動之犖犖大者，提鈎玄要，間以己意解剖而綜合之，獻諸國人，聊當新歲不腆之敬，其許我乎？</p>
<p>惟是列國五六十，而中國居其一，中國與其他五六十國交通頻繁，關係彌邇，中國之興革利害，第求之中國不可得也；而必求之列邦參伍錯綜之關係，譬之上海一市，銀價之升降，金融之張弛，其來源也，不在倫敦，則在紐約，一國之緩急而他國之榮枯系焉，所謂「銅山西崩，洛鐘東應「，居今日而論中國經濟，則宜以世界經濟爲先。撮其大要，略有數端。</p>
<p>百數十年來，世界各工業强國競以殖民爲共操奇計贏之尾閭，攻城略地，殺人盈野，弱者抑之爲保護國，允弱者，則夷之爲殖民地邇者經濟恐慌，關稅壁壘，日益高築，世界三數列强，各以其保護國與殖民地爲維持其貿易之必要範圍，自建藩籬，自成體系，而與其他列强之同等勢力相競，即世所謂集團經濟也。英以金鎊統制其帝國各殖民地各屬邦，故隸屬此勢力範圍之內者曰金鎊集團，法則以歐洲藏金最富之國，其支配東歐小國也則以金力。故隸屬此勢力範圍者，曰金集團；美則以金元支配拉丁美洲，近且伸人澳洲與加拿大，駸駸乎有取英帝國之勢力而代之之勢，隸屬此勢力範團者，曰金元集團。太平洋西岸有强國焉曰日本，雄心勃發，見獵而喜，亦效顰英美加緊製造一日本帝國經濟集團，以高麗，台灣及彼所謂「滿洲國」者爲其衛星，而尤垂涎於整個中國，故不惜百計操縱之，刦奪之，鯨吞蠶食，「日夜無休時」，此則東京政府所夢寐以求之者也，意大利立於地中海，力爭經營，勞師遠襲，而欲夷阿比西尼亞於保護者，亦此物此志也。然則集團經濟之後果如何？余則曰集團經濟爲兼併之結果，本身又爲後此兼併與夫大戰之因素。此其一。</p>
<p>東方美人，擁多金而無所發揮，陰血周作，張脈奮興，故金元匝地，狗肉臭於朱鬥，膏梁滿倉，餓莩塞夫道塗。人事不平，莫此爲甚，於是四野騷然，怨嗟滋起，羅斯福氏欲有以救濟之，故施行社會政策，一則使生產勿再過剩；一則使富者稍事撙節以濟赤貧，其意固在維持者現代工業之制於不壓也。貧者未嘗蒙其惠，而富者巳大感不便，楚歌四面，阻力橫生，羅斯福氏雖賈其餘勇，百般扎掙，終不獲效，而轟動一時之籃鷹運動遂不得不於此時「壽終正寢」，嗚呼，工於貨殖之美人，補苴漏罅，張皇幽渺如彼，其勞而無功也如此！此其二。</p>
<p>日英美之逐鹿中國，日益激烈，美則以門戶開放，爲矛以制日本之獨占，日本則以「大亞細亞主義」與「中國自力更生」爲盾，以排斥美國及其他列强，英則徘徊於日美之間，左右望而以保持己之利益爲得計。以三國投資之額計之，英第一，日决之，美又决之；然以三國投資中國增加速度衡之，則美爲首，日决之，英又次之。美日在華經濟衝突之遽如此，職是之由，而英之對日，旣不願其獨有中國，亦無力足以制之，而東菲風雲，關係帝國目前利益，視遠東爲允甚，其必用全力以周旋，宜也。日本得此千載一時機會，侵略中國更加緊迫而美其辭曰「經濟合作」，此其三。</p>
<p>此外則蘇聯經濟之特殊繁榮，異軍特起，使舊世界各工業列强允其是日本惴惴不自安，日蘇衝突之暴發，最近益有岌岌不可終日之勢；德則雖精於製作，而販路艱澀，經濟困窮，民生凋蔽，本已不堪，加之軍備平等恢復舊貫，苛徵無藝，國力耗竭，更不得不謀伸其瓜牙於世界弱小民族，不獲，則攫之於另一强敵之手，以償所欲，固所願也。法因是而日昕兢兢，不遑寢處，而英京海會矛盾百出，識者巳早卜其不終。此皆一九三五年臘鼓聲中，頻頻傳來之警號也。</p>
<p>反觀中國，允令余不寒而慄！然近年來建設之可觀者，如航空之擴充也，公路之建設也，鐵道之增築也，都市之改造也，然而「夕陽無限好，只是近黃昏」，此種建設就尋常事態言之，固皆必要之圖；然而當此內憂未已，外息日亟之秋，僅恃此種按步就班政策，絕不足興圖存，蓋强鄰相逼，若無非常之力以應之，即欲苟安一隅亦萬不可得，謂予不信，請證以下數事：</p>
<p>吾國朝野所競相自詡者，曰中國自古以農立國，吾儕一意振興農業，先使國家自給自足，至少天然物品，不假外求，夫然後再併力以圖振興工業，追踪列强而邁進之，庶幾本可立而末易達。然以近事證之，則殊未然。農業品之最重要者非米與麥乎？而吾國之米與麥皆須仰給外人，本年「上半年來全國洋米入口爲數共達一千一百餘萬公擔，値國幣七千五百餘萬元」；而「小麥輸入亦復可觀」，上半年中輸入洋麥其値關金一六，七八三，〇二九元（合國幣爲二九，四二八，一一〇元），其他雜糧之輸自外洋者，本年共達國幣一億一千一百六十六萬三千七百五十九元，合之米麥兩項，共値兩萬萬數千萬元。吾人尙不知本年下半年之糧食進口之數若何，然以中國饑荒情形考之，爲數當亦不貲，至少當與上半年相埒，若是則本年從外洋輸入食糧，大致不下五萬萬元，則所謂「以農立國」與「振興農業」，其意果安在乎？</p>
<p>且農業中食糧而外爲吾國出產大宗者非棉產乎？據棉產統計會估計：「本年產棉田三五，四八五，八一六畝，皮棉產棉八，三九一，〇一八擔，廢田面積一二，二九一，三〇〇畝，而去年棉田面積爲四四，九七一，二六四畝，皮棉產額爲一一，二〇一，九六擔。本年棉田廢去幾三分之一，而產棉减少亦四分之一而强，此固多由於天災，然而天災之薦至，蓋亦人事之不臧有以致之，然則所謂「以農立國」與「振興農業」其意又果安在乎？</p>
<p>且據中華棉業統計會公佈：中國各省棉田共爲三五，四八五，八一八畝，而河北棉田爲六，三一五，九七〇畝，除江蘇外實爲各省之冠，而其產額則且多於江蘇，今則巳入於日人經濟範圍，有喧賓奪主之勢，然則國人所謂「以農立國」與「振興工業」其意又果安在乎？</p>
<p>再請言工業，吾國工業之主力爲紗業，而本年之紗業情况，吾人竊聞之矣。益世報記者之言曰：「我人嘗統計今年我國停工及淸理之紗廠，合最近之申新一八兩廠，計巳有十八家之多。……全國華廠合共不過九十有二，今乃七個月內倒閉及停業者竟十八廠，的占全數三分之一弱，全國華廠紡錠有二，七四二，七五四枚，今在七個月內，計停工者巳有八一四，〇七六枚，的占三分之一弱，全國綫錠共有一，四三〇，〇四二枚，七個月內停工者巳有三四，四七六枚，約占四分之一。全國布機共計不過二〇，九二六台，七個月內停工者巳有六八一七台，占三分之一强。全國紡織工人共爲一五六二二四人，七個月內失業者巳有四二，九四八人。……長此以往，則兩年之內，我國之紡織工業，豈不將倒閉殆盡，我國民族工業之前途，尙堪聞問乎？」且本年下半年之紗業尙未卜其如何結算，然而以金融界之情形卜之，其必視前允惡無疑，然則所謂「自給自足」，其意又安在乎？自將由何道以達之乎？</p>
<p>或則又曰「振興工業交通爲先，故數年以來，建築公路，可謂不遣餘力，民國廿三年底，全國可通路綫計共十一萬一千公裏，比之民國十九年巳增加一倍有奇，而川湘黔公路各省縣公路，在本年亦多先後竣工，一二年內，我國公路網必可完成。完成之後，統一可期，蓋便利軍事運輸，溝通經濟，傳播文化，在在均賴公路之力，是則埋頭苦幹，固未可厚非也。余應之曰：唯唯否否，雖然現在之公路便利軍事運輸固矣，其於溝通經濟，傳播文化，猶未也。在人民不惟未覩其利，實則先受其害。蓋公路至某處，即外國經濟勢力侵入某處。所謂汽車也，汽油也，漏巵之數，與年俱增，而歐美日英之貨亦隨之而如水銀洩地，無孔不入，且也築路有費，保路有費，在在取之於終身勤勸之民，而農民反不得利用公路（如牛車，馬車等等）以爲交通，然則所謂「自給自足」其意義又果安在乎？又將由何道以達之乎？總之國家爲政，本身旣無術以自立，而金融恐慌，又隨內地農村破產，工業凋蔽，外而美國收買白銀，現金外流，信用制度，漸即破產。政府雖斷然施行貨幣統制政策，冀以挽回末運，然而東京政府首先反對，斥爲英倫陰謀，美國政府始而懷疑，旣而降低銀價，中國對外匯兌致無力保持其平衡，在世弱國欲僅於經濟範圍，與列强較一日短長，識者已早知其不可能矣！至於物價昂貴，百業停滯，猶其餘事：</p>
<p>愚曾引太史公不朽之言，覺今日猶不能不圖「待農而食，虞而出之，工而成之，商而通之」之道，蓋物力足而民力足，然後可以角逐於世界變亂之間，若以目前中國經濟情形而論，米麥棉鐵，大半莫不資於國外，工商業經濟，莫不困於凋敝，果一旦世界有非常之事變，中國至最後之關頭，其不土崩瓦解，束手待斃者，亦未嘗有，而中國民族前途，不堪設想矣</p>
<p>世界各國以經濟恐慌之劇烈，對榨取弱小民族經濟，侵略弱小民族土地之心亦日亟，以中國與各國關係如此深切，是中國民族非下最大之决心不可。然國家與民族之存亡問題，不能僅恃政府之努力得爲解决，吾儕國民，必須一致奮起，作政府有力之後援，以禦外侮，以應非常，而農村經濟之復興，工商業生產之培養，皆爲立國基礎，當此外侮日亟，國民經濟恐慌，尤不能不先事爲元氣之培養，以建設自給自足「之國民經濟。吾人固知在强鄰侵迫之下，絲毫未容吾人從事於埋頭建設工作，而土地之日蹙，更足使國民經濟以嚴重之損失，故須上下同心戳力，一方面政府極力從事農村經濟之建設，極力維護工商業之復興；一方面權衡國際情勢，國內資力，爲國家爭取領土之完整，主權之獨立，吾人讀蔣委長在五全大會之宜言，實不勝致其同情焉！</p>
<h3>歲時代序</h3>
<p>— 張鈺哲</p>
<p>臘鼓聲殘，歲序更新。看這山河破碎，完返何期，更不能不惆悵着光陰之易逝了，昔人常把流光此作逝水，以形容他的迅驟和那一去不回的情况。所以有『歲月不居，時節如流，』『如花美眷，似水流年』這些成語。但這個譬喩到底是吾正確。在那裏一去不返的、是光陰呢。或者還是我們這些人呢，我看這恐怕仍是一個問題。我們常聽到：『長江後浪逐前浪，世上新人換故人』這兩句的詩。陸機的歎逝賦裏說『川閱水以成川，水滔滔而日度。世閱人而爲世，人冉冉而行暮。人何世而弗新，世何人之能故』。這明明看透了世上的人們，正像那滔滔的江水。至於光陰自身原來是終古就在那裏，何嘗稍一動彈。究竟誰靜誰動，不過只是個相對的問題。列子御風，旣不辨風乘我耶我乘風耶。莊生曉夢也不知蝶夢周歟周夢蝶歟。我們在此只談科學不問哲理。這種玄之又玄的爭論，可以暫時撇置一邊。但是舊歲旣已棄我去，新年又來縈我心，乃是個極明顯的事實排在面前。光陰本是無影無蹤摸捉不定的東西，現在强要把他分作年月日時的叚落，又是誰爲爲之孰令致之。際此天道周星，一元復始的時候，對於這個問題，大家或者都還感些興趣。</p>
<p>我們現在這種的生活，從那不食　　之肉的陳仲子，或者不因人熱之梁鴻的眼光看來，必定很難認爲滿意。我們所以嘵得昨天是除夕，今天是元旦，完全是依賴看案頭日歷的報吿。因爲一年之何時始何時終，太容易知道了，我們反而把年的意義忽略過去。但是『山中無歷日，寒暑自知年』惟其山中野人沒有歷書可看，他們到切實知道年的意義，是和寒暑攸關。不過寒和暑各有一叚很長的期間。我們不能指定從寒到寒，從暑到暑，其間含有多少日數。換句話寒暑攸關的現象，未嘗不可以利用。最合乎科學的方法，莫過於立竿騐影。午時竿影夏日最短冬日最長，從影子最短至最短，或最長到最長，其中所經的期間，便整好等於一年。我國上古的時代，少昊金天氏以鳥紀官。因爲燕以春分來秋分去，司分之官便稱作乙鳥氏。因爲　以夏至鳴冬至止，司至之官便稱作伯趙氏。分至的日期全憑立竿見影的方法而定，四千年前就已設有專官執掌這種職務。我國歷法所以能發達得如此之早，自無足怪了。</p>
<p>據說埃及古代，定一年之長的方法，又自不同。他們每逢着尼羅河將要發生洪水的時期，便看見天狼星和太陽，在淸早的時候，有幾乎同時上昇的現象。他們便把這現象認作年的標準，而從這確定一年裏所包涵的時間，是三百六十五天又四分之一。但是這方法所定的年和寒暑季候之年並不完全一致。在短時間裏，這兩種年的差別雖然不顯。經過年深日久之後，在少昊氏分至之年裏，寒暑的時期是固定的。而在埃及這個根據太陽和天狼星偕昇之年裏，寒暑的時期，會逐漸提前。那末履端元旦，眼前時雖是雨雪霏霏。五千年後之元旦將見楊柳依依。一萬年後之元旦，竟可以火傘高張焦金流石了。年的意義豈不便要消失淨盡。</p>
<p>西撒（Julius　Caesar）雖爲羅馬帝國，托土開疆，雄才大略不可一世。而文化方面却也不免受了他的征服國埃及的影響。他於紀元前四十五年改革歷法的時候，便將埃及這三百六十五日又四分之一的年，不問皂白全部抄去。其中別出心裁的地方，或者就是將他自已的大名，加諸七月（Suly）之上這一點。這從西撒看來自是一種漢水沉碑硯山立表，留名萬古的妙法。然而繼西撒而登羅馬帝位者，安能不見此眼紅。所以奧穀斯塔皇帝（Augustus）也就替八月（August）改名，據爲已有。但八月原來只有三十天。這和西撒的七月比較。又不免相形見拙。於是他便想個辦法，從二月中奪出一天加到他自已的八月上去。可憐爲日已是無多的二月，經此剝削之後，就剩了二十八天。而七八兩月，便連着都是三十一天了。</p>
<p>這個歷法缺點，久而久之難免終要出現的。當西撒實行歷法改革的時候，春分是在三月二十五那天。在紀元後三二五年舉行宗敎大會議時侯，春分的日子已經提前到三月二十一日。到了一五八二年敎皇格里哥利（Grogrey）第十三的時候，春分之期竟然移到三月十一了。這位敎皇下了决心把歷法澈地改革一番。第一道命令說是那年的十月四日之後，緊接着就是十月十五日。當中廢去了十天，使着春分的日期仍舊回到三月二十一日去。第二道命令是每四百年裏，比從前沿用的歷法，要少閏三天，使每年裏平均日數比三百六十五天又四分之一略少一些，以與分至的年長短相符。從此以後一年中寒暑的時期，就不至於再有逐漸前移的現象。我們現在所用的新歷，也便是這種的格里歷法。</p>
<p>改革的事情，眞是談何容易。從我們自己推行新歷的經騐，很可以體會到改革歷法的困難。格里歷法當時也僅能推行到羅馬天主敎勢力所及的國家。英國因爲奉行新敎的關係，直到十八世紀才採用這格里新歷。爲着一個月裹憑空地要取消去十幾天，民間許多的契的合同都受他影響，曾經引起不少的糾葛。據說宮庭裏的貴婦，當時也是激烈反對這種改革的一份子。她們正愁着駐景無方，怕的是年華老大。這種改革使着將來所有的新年，都提早十餘天，豈不是等於東風催老的行徑。她們反對自也難怪了。至於俄國和羅馬尼亞採用格里歷法尙在中國之後。在他們的日歷上頭，也是新舊歷法的日期並列。二者相差眼前恰好是十三天。我們陰陽合璧的歷書，不愁沒有同志了。</p>
<p>其實格里歷法的改革，還不能算十三分的澈底。各個月份的日數，可以相差到三天之多。還有某月某日和星期幾之間，毫無一定的關係，我們必需察看歷書才能曉得。爲着免除這兩項的弊病，近年以來曾有好幾種新歷法的建議，提出到國聯那裏去。我覺得在這些地方，國聯不當恝置。反正侵略國終是無力制裁，何妨就在這無關痛癢的事情上，多加討論，多印報吿，藉以顯得工作的成績呢。</p>
<p>陽歷所以得名，便是因爲這種歷法，是專以太陽爲主。但顧了日躔就顧不得月離。於是月份就徒存下一個空名，而並不與太陰的圓缺相終始。從前陰歷的月份與朔望攸關，頗能名實相符。又設了閏月的制度，使每年平均之長，剛好合乎寒暑季候。可謂能做到雙方兼顧的地步。但一年裏面有時十二個月，而有時竟可十三月，也未免太不均勻。還是回回歷比較痛快，簡截了當就拿十二個朔望當作一年，把什麽寒暑季候，一切都置之不理。所以他們的一年只有二百五十四天。在三十餘年之間，他們的元旦便可以閱盡四時冷暖不同的風景。</p>
<p>總而言之，歷法上的歲時是用天文現象作根據的。地球繞日一周便是一年。太陰繞地一周，便是一月。地球自轉一次便是一天。這所講的只是物理上的歲時而已。至於人生心理上的時間，那又當另作別論。明明祗是一日不見，就可以如隔三秋。明明是百歲光陰，或比作電光石火。假使一人終身祇曉得自私自利，隨俗浮沉，生無益於時，死無聞於後，縱使他食得腸肥腦滿，壽享期頤。與殤子比來，也究竟能有幾分區別。反而言之，要是志切爲學的人，一心要探天地之奧，究事理之微。關於世間的思想常識，無不涉獵。而於專攻的學問，則能博極羣書，窮源竟委格物深思發皇光大。此等人便可以與天地共長久。要是心存濟世的人，抱己飢己溺之懷，獻身各項事業，使人人的衣食住行，都臻佳境。或者奮不顧身，領導民衆，抗禦異族的侵凌。此等人就作了在綺國殤，也已足浩氣長存，精忠千古。他們的精神可以永垂不朽。至於地球自轉幾周，繞日幾度，於他們的壽命，又何嘗有分毫的增損。</p>

<p>申報兒童專刊新年號</p>
<h3>元旦致辭</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>今天是中華民國二十五年的第一天，小朋友們又長了一歲了。</p>
<p>這是一年的開始，一年之計，也就從此開始。小朋友們應該重視這意義重大的一天，不要當做一個普通的放假日，輕輕放過。</p>
<p>你們在這一天，該回過頭去瞧瞧過去的三百六十五天，究竟得到了甚麽？讀了幾本書？寫了幾個字？作了幾篇文？智德體三育有沒有進步？可曾做錯了甚麽事情，而有對不起父母師長以及兄弟姊妹和同學們的地方？</p>
<p>要是讀書寫字作文全都用功；智德體三育都有進步；也不曾做過甚麽對不起父母師長以及兄弟姊妹和同學們的事情；那是再好沒有，過去的三百六十五天總算沒有虛度，而從今天起更要加倍的努力。</p>
<p>要是讀書寫字作文不肯用功，只知偸懶；智德體三育沒有進步，考分都不及格；平日常有逃學說謊或欺侮同學等種種對不起人的事情，那麽從今天起，就該改過自新，切切實實的從新做起，變成一個完完全全的好學生。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們要知道現在的中華民國，國難重重，再危險也沒有了。你們不要以爲自己年紀小，儘可吃喝玩耍，甚麽都不管。萬一祖國亡了，你們就是小亡國奴，一輩子也不能拾頭。目前第一要着，就是用功求學，使智德體三育一天天的進步，將來長大起來，便可追隨你們的父母師長之後，擔負救國的重任。</p>
<h3>恭禧</h3>
<p>— 章玉卿</p>
<p>靠寫字檯旁的上隅的墻壁上原有日歷的舊址，今天是換了個新的主人了。對啦！新的「元旦」又降臨到人間了。</p>
<p>淸早開開大門就從郵差手里接到了一份友人的賀年柬！我祗得辜負了這位友人的美意，我是厭惡地把這份紅色的賀柬丟進了字紙簏。何必多此一舉呢？至少是得白白地化費了十多個銅元！</p>
<p>眞討厭！在今天碰到人好像大家不說句「恭禧的話，以爲有失禮貌的。正因爲是這樣，致迫得我見到了人也不得不說上聲恭禧！恭禧！可是，我祗有自已責備着自已，爲什麽連得這點改造環境的勇氣都沒有呢？</p>
<p>不錯！在這年頭兒根本是使人要「恭禧」也「恭禧」不起來！</p>
<p>要我講幾句吉利話我是不擅長，那末，現在就趁大家都快樂的今天來講講這「恭禧「的來由吧！　相傳在幾千年之前，有一種野獸「年」它的形狀像牛，在平常的時候它是深居在山洞裏，但是，到了大除夕的一天，它是要出來吃人的。因此，那時候的人，到了大除夕的一天，大家老早就把門上了閂，槃在屋子裏以避「年」的傷害。可是，到了第二天——元旦日開開門來，彼此都看得沒有結「年」吃掉，所以大家都得說：「恭禧！恭禧！」這樣，漸漸地大家都變成習慣了。年復一年，後人就把這句話當作「元旦」日見了人的開塲白了。一直傳到現在。</p>
<p>現在雖然是沒有「年」再會來傷害我們了，要是我們能得細細地看一看，那知比「年」更兇猛的東西，正舉起着前爪在向我們撲來呢！</p>
<h3>新年來了</h3>
<p>— 龍湖小學女生　沈延英</p>
<p>新年來了，</p>
<p>好烏唱着甜蜜的歌曲；</p>
<p>老梅開着鮮艷的花朶；</p>
<p>多麽快樂呀！</p>
<p>新年來了，</p>
<p>弟弟妹妹穿起新衣裳</p>
<p>堂前看見爹媽倆，</p>
<p>拱拱手，彎彎腰，</p>
<p>呌聲，「今年運氣好！」</p>
<h3>快樂一天吧</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>在這新年的時候，一切都呈現着新的景象，小朋友們從今天起，也都增添了一歲，大家想想心裏眞是高興！大家都要快樂的過一天吧？</p>
<p>但是小朋友在那些過去的時候，一年三百六十五天的當中—那一天不是在過着快樂的生活呢，寒冷的時候有衣裳穿，饑餓的時候有飯食吃，在學校裏有師長的敎育，回到家裏有父母的愛撫，並且還有玩具娛樂，這些幸福的小朋友們，那一天不是在快樂中過着生活呢。</p>
<p>再看看那些窮苦的小朋友們吧；他們爲了農村破產，水災，旱災，兵災……不得不在四處流浪！在寒冷中掙扎！忍饑受餓！他們沒有錢去求學！他們的父母或者死亡！或者離散！卽使相守也無法相顧！他們不但在過去那些日子中天天過着困苦的生活，就是想在一年開始的時侯也不能快活的過一天呢。</p>
<p>這種窮苦的小朋友們，生活豈不是太可憐嗎？</p>
<p>所以我希望一般幸福的小朋友，在新年快樂的時候，不要忘記那裏還有連一天都不能快樂的窮苦的小朋友。我更希望小朋友們能從今日起，使體格比前更强健，使思想比前更登富，將來担起改進社會的重任，把這些窮苦的小朋友們，根本從水深火熱中解救出來。</p>
<h3>元旦滑圖雪</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>阿王牽了一隻木馬，在山坡上走。</p>
<p>阿麗在山坡下喊着：「阿王，你快下來呀；我們來慶祝元旦。」</p>
<p>阿王就騎了木馬，在山坡上滑了下來，恰巧對正着阿麗。</p>
<p>阿麗躱讓不及了，就給木馬撞成一個翻元寳。阿王說：「慶祝元旦呀！」</p>
<h3>未來的元旦</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>中華民國的兒童，有福分天天看報的，能有幾人？</p>
<p>在歡欣鼓舞的元旦，能抽出幾分鐘的時間來看報的，更有幾人？</p>
<p>抽起報紙來要找些可以開口一笑的新聞或新穎有味的談話的，又有幾件上海市曾在耶穌聖誕節假座各大戲院舉辦苦兒同樂大會，不是有一萬五千個未曾受過敎育的窮苦兒童到會嗎？在這一萬五千個苦兒之外，不是還有無數的苦兒因爲得不到入塲券而做了門外漢怏怏而去嗎？上海的一隅如此，他處可知。局部如此，全國可知。再推廣一想，全世界同樣的流浪苦兒，更是不可勝數了。</p>
<p>在快樂的日子，快樂的人加倍快樂；苦兒便顯出加倍的悽楚。</p>
<p>天賦人類的生存權本是一樣的。但除了吃空氣，麗太陽，賞明月淸風是完全平等以外，共他生活的必要條件，如衣食住等等便有萬萬千千的不公平。你道這不公平是天造地設的嗎？是命運註定的嗎？遝是可以用人的力量來改善的呢？</p>
<p>假使你相信這不是命運註定，而可以用人的力量來改善的話，那末負這改造責任的人是誰呢？</p>
<p>你一個人自然沒有這偉大的能力，但是你一個人却不能沒有這副救世的心胸。</p>
<p>每個讀報的兒童，懷着這一些救世的大願，以本身爲出發點，自立立人，己達達人，由民族復興，進而至於世界的改造。使未來的元旦，一切的兒童都快樂着，歡呼着，如登春陽之臺。</p>
<p>這樣的世界，纔是合理的人類的世界！</p>
<p>這樣的元旦，纔是普天之下同慶昇平的元旦！</p>
<h3>從今天起開始寫日記</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>兒童年」，「兒童國貨年」，「兒童××年」，一年一年又一年，在這一年一年中，我國究竟幹了些甚麽？小朋友們，你們可曾這麽想過麽？</p>
<p>「已往種種，譬如昨日死，未來種種，譬如今日生」，去年元旦日，或許大家都這麽想過的，而且或許都曾在去年元旦日，很興奮地要在未來的一年中，大大地對於各方面，都努力一下。但是在去年一年中，除了一天一天的混過去，除了在年齡上，增加一歲之外，有一些甚麽努力的成績，可以吿人呢？今天又是元旦日了。今天是民國二十五年的元旦。我希望小朋友的努力目標，不要太高太大，不要希望做一個一舉手，便能立致國家於富强的大英雄。我所希望於小朋們的，在跟着今天而來的一年中，幹一件很小，很簡便易行的事，——每天寫幾行日記。</p>
<p>我在這裏所提倡的寫日記，小朋友們，是和你們在學校裏所寫的日記，稍有些兒不同。例如「今天跟着哥哥逛大世界」，今天姑母來，給了我一匣糖菓，二件玩具」，「鄰家的阿毛，今天因不肯讀書，給他母親打了二下「等等，是一概不用的。我希望小朋友們所寫的日記，　讀書的筆記。如古昔賢哲的言語，行爲，只要是有利於國家，社會，家庭，個人之中的一項的，都記下來。　讀報的筆記。從報上讀得各國的兒童，或是名人，幹出了一件有利於社會人羣的事情，便記錄下來。再如某一國的政治如何，某一國的經濟如何，某一國的生產如何，以及我國的政治，經濟，生產，敎育，以及國貨洋貨的輸出入如何，都一一撮要的記錄。　生活的筆記。如目見的。或耳聞的父兄師友所幹的合理的或不合理的事，或自己所身歷的合理或不合理的事，或在校中，家中，街上所見的勇義的故事，或不平的事件，都一件件的記下來。</p>
<p>每年三百六十五天中，一天都不間斷的記着，閒下來時，自己翻着，瞧着，自省着，已往種種，如在目前，便可以已往的一切，作爲未來的生活的南針。</p>
<p>今天是二十五年的元旦日，我希望小朋友們，從今天起，一天都不停的寫日記。</p>

<h3>申報徴求「兒童志願文」的總報吿</h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>賀年的話</p>
<p>今天是民國二十五年的元旦，照例應該寫一篇祝賀的文章，上對國家下對同胞，說一番希望的道理；但是仔細想想，這種文章，實在太空洞，太幻想了。我們年年做這套例行的事，而國家一年不如一年，到如今，强鄰壓境，當局束手無策，國格掃地，成何世界！諸位小朋友，你們是未來的主人翁，要是照這樣下去，恐怕到你們成人的時候，不知要到什麽境地！不吉利的話，在新年本是不該說的，但對於親愛的小朋友，「心所謂危」，不能不說老實話啊！話要說轉來，國勢旣如此危急，萬分希望小朋友們，從根本上着想，加緊努力，各謀救國之道，引「多靴興邦」的古訓，以自慰自勵。下面只就本題報吿本報徴求「兒童志願文」的經過：</p>
<p>（一）徴文始末</p>
<p>本報徴求「兒童志願文」的動機，巳在去年雙十節專號上發表過了。當時定應微的期限爲四十天，——十月十一日至十一月底，——我爲便利統計起見，劃了一張紀錄表，把收信數目逐日記載，最初每天收二三件，十數件，四五十件，最多超過一百十六件，而每件之內，或一二篇，或五六篇，最多三四十篇，合在一起，所以四十天之內，收信二千餘件，而文稿統計在三千篇以上。截止之後，依然紛紛寄來，可是照章便不再收納了。這次應徵的兒童，近者江浙兩省，遠至雲·貴·川·康·邊陲各省，可說普遍全國；而遼·吉·黑·熱四省失地，也有不少，可惜都是從平津寄出的，他們是有家歸不得的難童，我們更表示十二分的同情。十二月一日起，開始閱稿，十五日閱畢，二十日公開評判，二十二日判定名次，照章於今天揭曉。</p>
<p>（二）評判情形</p>
<p>關於來稿的評閱，確是很費力的事；因爲總數有三千餘篇，每篇平均約四百字，統計全部爲一百二十萬字，逐篇評閱，自然很費功夫的。爲劃一標凖，事實上不能山幾個人閱稿，於是推定我一人先看，我於十一月一日起，整天工作，每天大的看兩百篇，費半月光陰，纔完畢初步工作。我把錄取的稿件，分作（甲）（乙）（丙）三等，選定甲等十八篇，乙等一百零五篇，丙等三十二篇，照章取一百十八篇，餘三十七篇作爲備取。這些稿件，交給周瘦鵑先生二决評閱，又仔細地看了一遍，抽出備取的三十七篇，他的意思，等次請陳鶴琴。陳選善·周夢熊·胡仲持四先生决定，經四位先生最後審閱，把第一獎至第四獎的十八名都判定了，其餘第十九名至第一百十八名，是以投稿先後爲次序的。此番評判來稿，我們自信始終很愼重，深知三千餘位小朋友寫作的苦心，怎麽能辜負了呢？可惜獎額有限，不能盡量錄取，覺得很抱歉的</p>
<p>（三）種種分析</p>
<p>這三千餘篇稿件之中，合於應微辦法的十之七八，不合手續的也有十之一二。籍貫以江蘇省爲最多，浙江安徽次之；年齡大都自十一歲至十五歲，以十四歲的最多；年級以六年級爲最多；文理都很通順，思想很切實，書法也很淸秀。我覺得許多小朋友們，將來都是很有希望的新國民。</p>
<p>（四）一般志願</p>
<p>小朋友們的志願眞不錯！我曾把一般的志願都記下來：如科學家，敎育家，工程師，飛行家，軍事家，醫學家，農藝家，政治家，外交家，礦學家，救國的戰士，健全的國民，女子方面，平時願做賢妻良母，戰時願做前方的護士。他們的意思，是說只有科學可以復興中國，興敎育可以救中國；擴充航空充實國防可以紓國難；發展農藝，開採礦產，可以裕民生；……這幾種志願，的確是中國所最需要的。我希望小朋友們，都該抱定此志，堅决實行，以盡國民的天職。</p>
<p>（五）特殊意境</p>
<p>這次徵文，我們認爲最滿意的，便是無論那一篇文字，都有愛國情緒的表現，如主張科學救國的解救國難的；恢復失地的；復興民族的；批評現實的；說得很透澈，很懇切，可見現在的兒童，部有國家觀念，愛國思想，不像以前茫無所知了。還有許多兒童，寫着很幽默，諷刺，滑稽的文字，可以證明國人對於現狀，尤其國難四年來沉悶的局面，巳有全國一致的覺悟。這三千餘兒童之中，幸運兒究屬少數，而災難交迫的苦兒，實居大半。他們字裏行間流露的，如喪父母的，遇天災的；貧苦的；遭兵匪之亂的；故鄉爲敵騎蹂躪的；受非法欺侮的；那種不幸的苦難，令人讀之心傷！</p>
<p>（六）道歉</p>
<p>我們很抱歉三千餘篇稿，倒有二千八百餘篇割愛了，請諸位原諒，不要灰心，本館預定以後每年舉行一次徴文或測騐，諸位得獎的機會正多，不必斤斤於一時的得失，再會吧，小朋友們！</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3>電信界之新希望</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>西諺云：「希望者事實之母也。」無論何人，均有某種希望，能達到某種希望，則心滿意足，超過某種希望，則喜出望外。元旦為一歲之首，春臨冬盡，除舊布新，社會形態，具有無限新氣象，人生意義，具有無限新希望。故元旦之辰，吾人欣欣然有喜色而相賀者，祝一年希望之圓滿也。</p>
<p>電信為國營事業，値此新年元旦，就國家意識與事業意識而言，對於今年—一九三六年—前途，均有莫大之希望。蓋電信事業與國家機構關係最鉅，苟國家存在，發生問題，皮之不存，毛將安附？電信事業，將同歸於盡也。茲將吾人今年之希望略述如左：</p>
<p>甲·對於國家方面者</p>
<p>希望鞏固世界和平　自東省事變發生，東亞和平，已受威脅，自義阿戰爭發生，世界和平，更經搖動。默察國際風雲，日趨緊迫，世界大戰，卜在今年。我國位於東亞，實逼處此，國人酷愛和平，殆成天性，和平未到完全絕望時期，决不放棄和平。苟和平一旦破壞，國際電信交通，首遭蹂躪，種種損失，不堪設想。</p>
<p>希望國內政局安定　欲成現代國家，必須從事建設，惟建設之先，必須政局安定。試觀國內各種建設事業稍有成績者，何莫非近年小康之賜。尤以電信建設與治安有關，苟政局不趨安定，則官電增多，商電减少，營業大受影響。他如割斷電桿，佔用電綫，干涉電政，均為軍閥時代常演之怪劇。現在中樞組織，堅固有力，國內政治必有澄淸之望也。</p>
<p>希望國家經濟發達　自銀價問題發生以來，我國金融，大受紊亂，經濟恐慌，達於極點！幸我政府採取有效辦法，實行通貨管理，籌碼增多，經濟頗呈活潑，各種產業部門，均有向上趨勢。產業振興，則利用電信者必多，利用者多，則事業日趨發展矣。</p>
<p>乙·對於社會方面者</p>
<p>希望政軍當局維持電信　電信為傳達政軍消息之利器，需要甚切，而利用之時須照定章辦理，莫可或濫。近來年關於取締私事官電，取締電桿搭掛軍用話綫，均得軍事當局之帮助，而收相當之成效。至於政軍機關發寄電報與租用電話，尙有未照章付費者。過去已矣，嗣後希望政軍機關應付電費，一律如數照付，使電政經濟上有所調濟，方可從事建設也。</p>
<p>希望社會人士通力合作　電信為公用事業之一，須得社會人士之合作，然後有所改進，故調整公衆之關係，為交通部施政之方針。社會人士，對於電信，有何意見儘可切實陳明，或吿知業務稽查員，電政當局，無不虛誠採納。自業務稽查制度實行，已得公衆良好印象，吾人希望進一步切實合作，則電信設備，方足以滿公衆之望。</p>
<p>希望企業家組織電料工廠　查我國電料，多係舶來品，利源外溢，每年不下數百萬，且一旦國際戰事發生，來源斷絕，電信交通，有立刻停頓之虞。現在交通部規定對於國貨電料，儘先採用，奈以質量均缺，供不應求。希望各企業家今年投資建設電料工廠若干所，直接發展國內工業，間接維護電信交通，一舉兩得，何樂不為！</p>
<p>以上所陳，對於國家方面者，係一般希望，對於社會方面者，係個別希望，均與電信事業，有切身關係。今年如能一一實現，電信前途，實利賴之。至於本刋同人，希望社會人士不吝賜敎，則企禱有日，不僅今年元旦始也。</p>
<h3>民國二十四年之國際電台</h3>
<p>— 哲夫</p>
<p>交通部國際電台自成立迄今，已逾五稔，所有該台籌建經過，以及營業設備擴展情形，經已分誌本刋民國二十三，二十四兩年元旦特刋。該台經交通部四年餘之慘淡經營，規模大具，自民國二十四年起，更切實充實設備，改進業務，俾新興之我國國營國際電訊業務克臻昌明懿媺之域。茲屆民國二十五年獻歲之辰，爰將該台過去一年之事業晋展概况，分述如次：</p>
<p>關於業務之改進者</p>
<p>增闢通報電路—國際台通報電路，在民國二十三年前，原有香港，馬尼刺，爪哇，西貢，舊金山，柏林，巴黎，日內瓦，莫斯科各處，二十三年內，先後開放倫敦東京兩路，於是世界名都巨邑，均可通達無綫電報。但交通部為擴充我國國際通信業務起見，對於國際台新電路之籌闢，仍努力規劃，二十四年一月，羅馬電路正式開放，於中意間通信，遂益形迅捷，至其他擬闢電路，亦經陸續試騐通報，已闢電路，並經依照報務繁忙情形，增調收發報機工作，通信速率，亦較前大增。</p>
<p>提高轉報速率—我國國內各地，拍往國外電報，為數甚多。此項電報向由上海電報局有綫無綫兩報房接轉，該局報房與國際台報房間，裝有專綫，傳遞向甚迅捷。嗣交通部為减低此項轉遞時間，益求精進起見，特在上海電報局報房，及國際台報房，各裝複鑿機多部，俾國內重要各局，均得與國際台用通號直接通報，實行以來，非特省時，抑且更形凖確，內地民衆，咸稱便利。</p>
<p>郵局代收電報—自交通部實施郵電合作辦法以後，滬上各郵局均代收國際無綫電報，在實行之初，暫以現金電報為限，嗣為便利各界記帳發報起見，自二十四年四月一日起，凡持有國際台各項記帳簿之發報人，均可向就近郵局拍發國外電報，各界向郵局拍發此項電報者，因之較前特增，無不稱便。</p>
<p>機車接取電報—自滬上各郵局實行代收國際無綫電報以後，各界已甚感便利，惟上海市區遼闊，有時不免仍有不便送往郵局發報者。如遇此種情形，發報人均可用電話通知國際台派人往接電報，此項接報事宜，向由國際台報差辦理，惟報差對於計算報費，收取銀錢，都不諳熟，故所接電報，只得限於記帳各戶。自二十四年起，國際台特購備機器自行車，並特設專員數人，一遇電台，立卽駕車馳往接報，有如商店之電話購貨，顧客雖足不出戶，亦可與國外隨時通信矣。</p>
<p>厲行正誤校對—交通部因有鑒於電文正確性關係之重要，前於二十三年底，特准國際台招雇校對電報生三十名，由該台積極訓練，担任校對電報工作，無論來去轉各種電報在收到或發出後，立卽校對一遍，設有錯誤，不待關係人之查詢，立卽通知更正。此項辦法，實行一年，收發報人對於電文上之查詢，已見銳减，社會人士對於國際無綫電報之信仰，於是益堅。</p>
<p>推行稽查辦法—交通部為廣徵電報用戶對於電報局台之意見，以便益求改進起見，前曾令飭全國各局台設置業務稽查員，担任對外電報業務上一切稽查事宜，而於國際台經轉之國際無綫電報，允為注意，至於來去電報經過內部各項手續，國際台內各部份，亦按步校核，萬一有誤，卽可立加更正。自二十四年起，國際台為嚴密此項對內稽查工作起見，更加設報務稽查員數人，專任一切報務上稽查事宜，國際報務，因以益見精進。此外該台對於投送各地來報，前經添雇報差，嚴限投送時刻，自二十四年起，又奉交通部令，特設稽查報差數名，專任稽查報差送報工作。凡此種種，皆為求業務之改善，亦卽謀電報用戶之便利。</p>
<p>廣播業務消息—交通部為使各界明瞭電報章則及設施起見，特制定電信業務廣播宣傳辦法，令飭全國各重要局台分別推行。國際電台以國際無綫電報係屬新興事業，允宜有宣傳週知之必要，爰遵部令與部轄上海廣播電台洽定，按日作數决播音，舉凡各種新章則之施行，報價之更改，以及其他業務消息，均於此項播音中宣佈。</p>
<p>印發電報用品—國際電台前為便利各界明瞭國際電報情形起見，曾印發小冊一種，月出一期，中英文俱備，各界函索此項小冊者甚多，該台現又為謀電報用戶之便利計，特製就關於電報上印刷用品，如各種大小式樣之去報紙，查訊電文紙，拍報用信封等等。用戶如有所需，可隨時電話通知索取。如經洽定月需數量，該台並卽按月寄送。以期兩便。</p>
<p>關於設備之充實者</p>
<p>裝設無綫電話機—交通部向英訂購之無綫電話機件，於二十四年春間裝運到華以後，卽由國際電台着手裝設，於五月間完工，嗣卽開始較騐，並與倫敦，東京等處試騐通話，成績甚佳，本年二月間卽可正式與國外通話。至國內無綫電話亦已由該台裝置完成，一俟漢粵兩地試騐戰事，卽可開放商用。</p>
<p>增裝高電力調幅器—國際電台眞如發報台亞爾西愛式發射機為適合報話兩用起見，卽於民國二十四年秋間，向美訂購高電力調幅器一具，一俟裝運到滬，卽可裝設，以後該機通報通話，可以兩用，效率大增。</p>
<p>增建收發信定向天綫—長距離通信之迅捷，與定向天綫有密切關係，故國際電台為增進電報效率起見，於二十四年間增建完成定向收信天綫四座，定向發射天綫一座，而正在興建中者尙有定向收信天綫四座，定向發射天綫二座，不日亦可以完成</p>
<p>校騐各台週率—近年來短波通信發達，全世界電台數量，增加甚速，致週率分佈日密，於是週率之穩定，遂成一重要問題，而精確之標準測波器，尤為各大電台主要設備之一。國際電台之標準測波器，自二十四年內裝竣使用以來，除每日測量本台各發射機週率外，並應環境需要，隨時校騐各國外電台之週率，一遇干擾，是非立斷。最近併奉交通部令，測定全國各電台之週率，此後國內外各台週率，當可有所準繩矣。</p>
<p>製造無綫電機件—國際電台於二十四年內曾奉令製造國內通信用五百華特無綫電發報機三架，一瓩發報機三架，各發報機均係採用恒溫控制主振器，故週率較為穩定，可適高速度發報之用，除第一及第二兩機業已完成，運往北平等處裝設外，其餘正在試騐及製造中，不日均可工竣。</p>
<p>上述各節，係國際電台在民國二十四年一年中事業之犖犖大者，本年二月國際無綫電話卽可正式開放商用，此項世界嶄新事業，我國已能步武建設，足徵我國交通當局具有迎頭痛趕之精神。尙望該台員工秉此精神，繼續努力，俾事業精進，日新月盛，明年元旦，得有更著之懋績，由本刋舉以報吿國人也。</p>
<h3>交部改善一電發寄數處辦法</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>—請各機關擬稿員譯電員注意—</p>
<p>一張電報同時發往許多的地方，事賞上本來有的。例如中央政府對各省發出緊念的命令，或是外交部對駐外使領發出訓令，都要同時發寄許多電報，這些電報的電文往往都是相同的。不過照例這許多電文相同的電報，每一個電報只能寫上一個發往地名，和每一封郵信只能寫上一個收信地名一樣，這是一個很淺顯的道理，誰都容易明白的。但是實際上我國政軍機關所發的官軍電報，每一張電報往往會寫上三個五個以至幾十個地名和人名，原因無非為省却多抄幾遍電文的手續，但是電局收下後，要多費好幾倍的手續，有時還要發生許多弊病。這裏我先把一電連寫許多地名的弊病列舉出來：</p>
<p>一、挨路拍發難免延擱　電局的綫路四通八達，一張同時發寄數處的電報，要是每一地名分寫一份，電局可交東南西北四路同時發出，毫不延擱。要是許多地名寫在一份電報上，那麼電局祗能先交東路發出，再交南路西路北路挨次發出，假定每路拍發要費五分鐘，最後一路發出的電報，就要躭擱十五分鐘，實際上上海南京等電局的綫路，多至二三十路，要是收報地名很多的電報，最後一路發出的電報，延擱的時間更多了！</p>
<p>二、忙中漏發　每電祗寫一個收報地名，旣簡單，又顯明，電局人員當然不致漏發但是一電寫上二三十個地名人名和住址，就不免繁雜混亂，偶一疏忽就難免漏發一處，等到發覺，再行補發，就不免誤事了。</p>
<p>三、誤會漏轉　電局綫路並非一律直達，如距離太遠，就須經過中間局的轉遞。如一電寫上子丑寅卯等許多地名，甲局照例應拍發子丑兩處，但因與丑地綫路阻斷，所以只發子地一處，同時乙局照例祗須拍發寅卯兩處，但因甲局與丑地綫路阻斷，丑地亦應由乙局轉發，惟乙局尙未接到甲局與丑地綫阻的公電，所以仍舊祗發寅卯兩處，於是丑地就不免漏轉了。電局的綫路情形很複雜，這不過舉一個簡單的例子罷了。</p>
<p>四、重複轉送　照上面舉的例，要是甲乙兩局，不問綫路情形如何，大家往丑地，就不免重複，所以常有同一電報送交收報人在二三次以上者，不但電局多費工料，而且容易起引收報人的誤會，以為電局辦事糊塗，其實一張電報上地名太多，甲局發到乙局和丙局，乙局收到後，以為甲局還沒有發弊病電局也曾想許多方法去避免，但是總不能完全免掉。</p>
<p>五、傳遞遲慢　一張電報上寫了甲、乙、丙、丁、戊等許多地名人名和住址，發往甲地某甲的電報，也同時連帶了乙、丙、丁、戊、等地名人名和住址一起拍發，拖泥帶水，豈不麻煩費事，越是地名多，打起來越慢！</p>
<p>六、多耗電費　許多地名人名連在一起的電報，電局計算電費時，仍照每一地名作一份計算，不但沒有便宜，反因每電都把許多地名人名的字數算在裏面，電費吃虧很大！我們常看到一張電報，電文不到四五十字，地名人名和住址的字數，倒有二三百字，結果每份電費一律照二百或三百多的字計算，不是吃虧得太不値得嗎？</p>
<p>以上說的六種弊病，都與發電人有切身的利害關係，給予電局的業務上的困難，自然很大，所人交通部最近擬訂一種「同文電報發寄辦法」，目的在保障發報人的利益，和避免業務上的錯誤。該項辦法的要點如下：</p>
<p>一、同一電文發往數個收報地名的電報，每份祗能寫上一個收報地名，就是發往十處的電報，應該分寫十份。但是為减省發報人的手續起見，電文祗要書寫一份，其餘九份祗須寫上收報地名和人名住址，電文欄內祗要註明「電文與發致某處某人電報相同」，不必每電都抄電文，手續也很簡單。</p>
<p>二、如係發致各省市或多數人的通電，要收報人知道收到的電報是一張通電，也不必全把許多地名人名寫在一張電報上，只要在收報地名以前加註「通電」二字，電局就會另加一種標識，使收報人知道。</p>
<p>三、非通電而欲收報人知道該電同時發致某處某人者，可在電文內叙明「除分電某某外」等字樣，不必將地名人名寫在電文之前。</p>
<p>四、一電發致數人在同一地方者，可照分送電報辦法，在地名以前加註「分送若干份」字樣，不必照同文電報例分作數份發寄。</p>
<p>以上辦法，已經交部呈由行政院轉呈國民政府通令各機關，自二十五年一月一日起實行。希望各機關擔任擬電稿或譯電工作的人員，預先加以準備，如能將常發之地名人名預先用印電紙分別寫好，臨時只要抄譯一份電文，檢出幾份寫好的印電紙，就可交與電局拍發，那就省事而又迅捷了。</p>
<h3>過年</h3>
<p>— 逸仲</p>
<p>千遍，萬遍，</p>
<p>年鑼敲鬧着的調兒，</p>
<p>花砲的星星，</p>
<p>追着鄰孩天眞的童心。</p>
<p>香噴噴地，</p>
<p>隔璧飛過來年糕的味兒，</p>
<p>殷勤勸飲，輕盈的語聲，</p>
<p>充滿着團聚的歡欣！</p>
<p>關山阻隔了融洩的家庭，</p>
<p>淸冷的屋子，空守着硯水結冰！</p>
<p>孤寂凝凍了旅人的心，</p>
<p>溫慰，親近，何處追尋？</p>
<p>驀地聲聲剝啄，</p>
<p>傳來家中的一紙賀年電報，</p>
<p>每一句話兒分外的溫存，</p>
<p>今朝啊，至少也念上千遍萬遍！</p>
<p>畢竟是科學的功效，</p>
<p>遙遙的情意瞬間遞到，</p>
<p>凍筆下擠住了萬千句話語，</p>
<p>倚門的人兒巴望我的回報。</p>
<h3>一年來長途話綫之擴展</h3>
<p>— 驛</p>
<p>在敎育尙未普及之我國，長途電話之需要，實較電報為殷切。益以各地市內電話日漸普遍，長途話綫之接通，更為國內通話之急務，過去交通當局對於電報綫路之敷設，雖已略具規模，但長途話綫，寥落可數，國內主要都市，尙未能連絡通話，殊為電信交通一大缺憾。交部有鑒於此，茲有建設九省長途電話之計劃，以連絡國內主要都市為目的。一年來努力進行，已有京蕪，濟津，濟靑，京銅，滬通，鎭淮，溫福，厦福，巴成，及巴貴等綫路之完成，茲將各綫通話概况，略述於後，幸讀者注意焉。</p>
<p>一、南京至蕪湖　南京蕪湖間本有鐵話綫一對，施行交叉，開放電報電話同時通信，惟該路話綫因與滬漢，京漢等報綫併桿架設，故每遇報綫發生障碍，輒將話綫開放通報，停止通話，頗為社會人士所詬病。現於京蕪間添設銅綫，開放通話，而以原有之鐵話綫一對開放京蕪間之當塗，太平，江寗鎭，板橋鎭等處通話，以免擁塞。</p>
<p>二、濟南至天津　濟津間本亦有鐵話綫開放通話，惟因區間各局過多，通話不免困難。查平津及濟靑間均已用銅綫通話，濟津間話綫亟須改用銅綫架設，以資連絡，該段銅綫，經交部之督促，已於本年五月間完成。至區間各局仍在鐵綫上通話，以資疏通。</p>
<p>三、濟南至靑島　濟南靑島間本有銅話綫兩對，一為開放濟靑問直達通話，一為開放區間各地通話，茲以濟靑間話務繁忙，通話時感擁塞，特於濟靑間增加話綫兩對，改以兩對開放濟靑直達，一對開放濟南張店濰縣靑島四處區間通話，另一對開放沿綫各地通話。</p>
<p>四、南京至銅山　京銅間本無直達話綫連絡，現亦經架設銅綫，開放南京蚌埠銅山連絡通話，至京銅間之宿縣，臨淮關，明光，滁縣等處通話，則利用報綫兩條，施行交叉，開放報話同時通信。</p>
<p>五、上海至南通　滬通間因商業上之關係，電信交通極為重要，交部現於該兩大都市間架設銅綫一對，沿途並引入無錫，開放滬錫通三地連絡通話。</p>
<p>六、鎭江至淮陰　鎭江淮陰間本亦有鐵綫通話，惟因區間局處太多，通話時感擁塞，交部為改善起見特於鎭淮間架設銅綫一對，開放鎭江高郵江都淮陰等處通話，而以原有之鐵話綫，開放區間通話。</p>
<p>七、福州至永嘉　福州永嘉（卽溫州）間本無電綫連絡，卽電報亦須由他路轉遞，不便殊甚。為便利福永間通信起見，特架設銅綫一對，開放通話，並以該路話務，尙未十分發達，故沿綫之福鼎，福安，羅源，琯頭，馬尾等處亦均在該綫上連絡通話。</p>
<p>八、福州至厦門　福厦間現已架設銅綫一對，開放通話，惟以沿綫各地太多通話時威阻擾，交部現正計劃將福厦間第一及第三報綫施行交叉，開放區間各局報話同時通信，而以現有之銅綫一對開放福州晋江厦門三地連絡通話，以免擁擠。</p>
<p>九、巴縣至成都　巴縣至成都向無話綫連絡，嗣因當地商業上及軍事上之關係，現經架設銅話綫一對開放通話。</p>
<p>十、巴縣至貴陽　巴縣至貴陽本無直達話綫，為應付當地軍事需要計，亦經架設銅綫一對開放通話。</p>
<p>以上所述，均為幹綫之建設，至支綫方面，現均利用電報綫開放報話雙用，一年來亦擴展甚多，容當另文記述之。</p>
<h3>車站郵電代理處之實現</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>鐵道交通兩部為謀便利旅客通信並使整個國營交通事業密切聯絡起見，曾有創設全國各鐵路車站郵電代理處之計劃。雙方商定先就京滬滬杭甬兩路之南京下關·鎭江·常州·無錫·蘇州·上海北站。上海南站·嘉興·杭州城站等九站先行試辦。俟將來辦理著有成效，再行逐漸推廣，以期普及。惟以車站郵電代理處設施，在我國尙屬創舉，且事關鐵路·郵政·電報三項，不但交通部本月所轄郵電兩局必須自相聯絡，卽與鐵道部主管之鐵路管理局，亦應通力合作。此事由三方交換意見，業經决定，並由上海電報局派員會同上海郵政管理局及京滬滬杭甬鐵路管理局三方代表，自上海出發親走兩路沿綫各站察勘各該車站設置郵電代理處之地位並規定開放營業時間，略述如次：</p>
<p>南京下關站　郵電代理處卽設於車站問訊處內，由車站在前而玻璃漆書「郵電代理處」等字，以資標識，該代理處之地位頗為衝要，且為出入必由之路。旅客如欲發電寄信，極易尋覓，至為便利也。又該代理處除星期及例假日收售郵伴電報及公用電話概照郵局規定之假期辦公鐘點辦理外，平時係晝夜開放營業，並無限制。</p>
<p>鎭江西站　該站本已設有公用電話零售處。路郵電三方以該零售處設於售票處旁邊，旦靠近月臺，地位甚佳。故將該處原有地位加以擴充，改組為郵電代理處，營業時間八時至二十四時。但星期及例假日，除報話仍可照常收售外，所有郵政信件，照郵局假期辦公鐘點內收寄。</p>
<p>常州站　該站郵電代理處係設於車站電報房內。該代理處一面有窗臨月臺，一面有門近售票處，兩面均設有窗口，以利營業。營業時間，並無限制。星期及例假日之郵伴，照郵局規定鐘點收寄。</p>
<p>無錫站　該站郵電代理處設在月臺之旁，為旅客出入要道，地位甚佳。營業時間係自七時起至二十一時為止，星期例假日之郵件，係照郵局辦公鐘點辦理。</p>
<p>蘇州站　查該站亦已設有公用電話零售處，現由車站設法將原有地位擴充改為郵電代理處。營業時間自八時起至二十二時止。</p>
<p>上海北站　該站郵電代理處卽設於原有之電報房內，地位頗佳。營業時間並無限制，星期及例假日郵件照郵局辦公鐘點收寄。</p>
<p>上海南站　該站所設郵電代理處係由路局設計裝修並由上海電話局派話務員駐站値守。其營業時間，八時至二十四時。</p>
<p>嘉興站　該站特將原有站長室騰讓，以供設置郵電代理處之用。並在月臺上及售票處兩面開窗以便接近公衆。營業時間與上述各站大致無異。</p>
<p>杭州城站　該站所設郵電代理處在車站電報內靠近月臺及售票房，兩面均有營業窗口，極為便利。營業時間並無限制。</p>
<p>上述各車站郵電代理處為便利外僑起見，均已在名牌上加註英文名稱：「Postal　and　Telegraph　Agency」等字樣，一切設備頗為周到。今日業已開始營業。從此中外旅客臨行時如欲發電寄信或與親友通話，隨時均可就近前往郵電代理處接洽，所需郵資電費均照郵電兩局定章核收，並不額外加收任何費用，此項便利旅客之設施，適於元旦觀成，新年新猷，殊堪為交通事業前途賀也。</p>

<h3>一年來之江蘇民政</h3>
<p>— 余井塘</p>
<p>井塘綰蘇省民政，時逾年半。茲値新年，謹檢討過去一年之成事，且為將來之策勉，略舉十端分述如次。</p>
<p>一，確定各縣中心工作　本省年來疊受水旱巨災，欲圖振衰起敝，頭緒紛繁，悉心探研，知非熟審地方實際需求，確立中心標準，不足以赴事功，特於二十四年五月通飭各縣就人民之需要及財力人力所能勝任者，依照會計年度，造具二十四年度中心工作實施大綱，並明定「具體辦法」「實施程序」及「工作進度」，統限六月一日以前呈候核定飭遵，其已設專員公署所屬各縣，槪呈由專員核轉，俾作初步審查，附具意見，以備省廳採酌。截至九月底止，先後據各專員各縣長呈送大綱及審查意見前來，先經分送各廳處予以審核，再由本廳彙案核定，指令依照，循序推行，其未列入二十四年度預算及與預算不符，或非地方切急需要，且為財力一時所不能勝任者，概予刪除，並為便於考核成績計，八月間通飭各縣於逐月造具工作報吿時，應依照核定之中心工作將經辦情形分列詳報。於是府廳監督上之效用，較前得益臻嚴密，而縣政設施亦有標準可循矣。</p>
<p>二·增加縣行政經費　縣政府為推行一切縣政之樞機，而經費與人事之支配，適應與吾，關係於政令之推行至為深切，年來各縣政務殷繁，佐治人員額數旣感不敷，而餼廩又感微薄，在在足以影響事功，爰斟酌各縣實際需要，將佐治人員額數重行釐定，待遇亦略予提高。因之各縣行政經費，較前略有增加，計一等縣月增一百十六元，二等縣月增一百二十元，三等縣月增二百三十元，提經省政府委員會議决通過，自二十四年度起通飭施行。縣行政組織旣經充實，縣行政效率自可隨之增加矣。</p>
<p>三·實施保甲敎育　本省於二十三年四月决定舉辦保甲，全省六十一縣，除江寗自治實騐縣外，所有保甲編查工作，業於二十四年七月先後全部完成，其須繼續進者，厥為保甲敎育之實施。質言之，即訓練保甲制度下之鄕鎭保甲長及人民便明瞭保甲之眞諦，俾收運用之實效。經訂定鄕鎭保甲長各項訓練辦法，鄕鎭長訓練由行政督察專員負責辦理，其未設專員各區，由本廳直接辦理，保甲訓練由各縣縣長負責辦理，甲長訓練由各區區長負資辦理現六十一縣之鄕鎭長，共計八千零六千六人均經分別訓練完畢，全省共六萬八千三百六十保，已辦保長訓練者計五十七縣，已受訓之保長共六萬四千零七人，全省共七十一萬七千七百八十六甲，已辦甲長訓練者計銅山等十縣，受訓之甲長共十四萬八千六百零七人。自經分別施訓以後，各鄕鎭保甲長，於保甲意義以及政府現行法令均有相當了解，似此保甲敎育之普及，對於保甲制度之進行誠多裨益。</p>
<p>四·運用保甲制　保甲制度果能運用盡善，實為推行政令發揚民力重要機構，惟推行伊始未能責以煩重工作，誠恐各級保甲人員組織甫成，力或未逮任務殷繁，難期盡善，故提經省政府委員會會議通過。决定暫以(一)防治盜匪，(二)禁烟禁毒，（三）徵工浚河，(四)强迫識字敎育四項，為二十四年保甲運用範圍，通飭各縣遵照。餘俟基礎鞏固，再行酌量推進。目前收效最著者厥為防治盜匪一項，如蘇北之徐淮海等地，匪風素熾，去年靑紗幛起閭閻均能安堵，尤以淮陰區自前次舉行勦匪後，地方安謐，實近年所僅見，保甲運用之效，於此可見其大端。次為徵工浚河，上年度各縣徵工總數達四十萬人，即知築堤防黃，動工集數萬人，而微湖西堤一役，不崇朝即鳩合十餘萬工夫，於兩星期間築成二十里之長堤，工程迅速更可見，保甲制度運用之效能。餘如各縣辦理十地陳報及烟民之查擠，亦多賴保甲以為之應，運用保甲之功，實已灼然可見。</p>
<p>五·整理公安經費　各縣公安經費預算向未確立，流弊滋多井塘視事之初，即以整頓公安為安定社會與發揮行政效率之要途，亟應從確立公安經費預算入手辦理，故於會核各縣地方預算之際，根據統收統支原則，權衡各縣地方治安情形及地方財力，將各縣公安經費妥為支配决定，提經省政府委員會議决通過，分飭遵行。嗣後公安各項經費，統由縣政府直接征收，幷遵照核定之預算，按月發放，公安經費於確定。舉凡向日虛收實支，或自籌自用等積弊，可望革除，初步目的旣達，此後當致力於一經費之充實，以期事業之進展。</p>
<p>六·實施警察敎育　警察人員負執行警政之任務，自須受有警察敎育，方能勝任稱事，故首令各縣嚴加甄別，淘汰老弱，設立長警補習所分期抽調現役長警，入所受訓，復確定各縣警察補習敎育計劃由廳編訂外勤須知等各刋物及術科進度袤，責成所屬各級公安長官切實遵行，嗣鑒於已往各縣分別設立長警補習所，人力財力，均感未充，未免因陋就簡，成效不彰。爰擬集中力量，劃全省為若干訓練區，設立區訓練所，以期訓練效率之增進，此就原有警察實施敎育情形言之。至謀將來全省警政更進一步之發展，當於二十三年秋設立省警察訓練所，招收初中畢業生二百名，施以警管區制敎育，養成刻苦耐勞品學幷重之警察基本人材，二十四年秋季復事擴充，除繼續辦理學警班外，增設警官班招考高中畢業生一百名，施以二年之嚴格敎育，一面指調各縣公安機關現役長警八十名，幷招收曾在警官學校畢業者一百名，設置警官補習班，施以六個月之訓練，現以訓練所名稱已不適用，乃更名為江蘇省警官學校。</p>
<p>七·試行警管區制　警察勤務制度，以警管區制為最易收效，已成不易之論，本廳前為試辦警管區制曾訂定江蘇省試辦警管區制計劃大綱，提經省政府會議通過施行，即於省警察訓練所，規定此項制度為基本訓練，所有畢業官警已於二十四年七月悉數分發崑山縣實地試騐，試行三月，頗著成效。他如嘉定，南匯，宜興等縣，亦先後擇地試行，皆獲有相當成績。現正通槃籌劃，一俟警察敎育逐漸普及，當以此制推行全省，以謀警察實務之澈底改善。</p>
<p>八·整理幷擴充救濟事業　本省救濟事業創行已久，而因循之弊，亦不免積久而滋深，年以來，民生凋敝，窮苦無吿之民，亟待救濟者日衆，而地方救濟機關積習相沿，內容窳敗，匪但積極救濟，未能計劃施行，即消極救濟，亦多有待改進，亟應加以整頓從事擴展，整頓之方，不外從組織經費人事三方面着手。關於組織方面，所有各縣救濟機關性質相同者，槪飭斟酌經濟情形及事業需要，分別裁併籌統辦理以免多所紛岐。關於經費方面，所有基金產業，槪須集中管理，統一支配，經臨各費，務於年度開始以前編具預算，呈廳稽核用杜浮濫，行政費用，務求緊縮至最小限度，以謀事業費用之儘量擴充。關於人事方面，除對於主持人員，嚴加甄別妥愼遴選外，幷隨時加以考核，至各所事業，則力謀敎養兼施，雖老弱殘廢均須授以有益身心之敎育及適當之技能，期能獨立謀諮，以達積極救濟之目的，此項整頓，事先為周路博訪起見，曾於二十四年五月召集全省救濟事業會議，詳加討論，復由廳擬訂實施辦法，通飭遵行，現本省救濟事業，較前已有進步，惟於擴充方面，以本省迭遭災祲，經費籌措匪易，未能一致積極進行。現各縣勉籌欵項，增立院所者，計有溧水，溧陽，揚中，奉賢，川沙，寳山，宜興，泗陽，儀徵，沭助，寳陽等十一院，二十一所。</p>
<p>九·推進衛生事業，自陳主席蒞蘇，對於衛生行政，積極策劃督飭推進，幷創辦醫政學院，造就醫政人材，以為改進衛生行政之準備，本廳年來對於是項事業，一面制定縣立醫院組織規程，嚴定院長及醫生人選，以求組織內容之完善，其未設立縣立醫院之縣份，飭即遵照新頒規程，從速籌劃創辦。如確因經費竭蹶，一時不克成立者，准於戒烟所內附設診療接產兩部，幾經督促，粽計二十四年增設之醫院，有海門，太倉，崑山，淮安，碭山，銅山等六縣，設診療部者計有高淳，吳江，六合，興化，沭陽等五縣，一面復於淮陰設一城區衛生實騐區，鎭江之丹徒諫壁設一鄕鎭衛生實騐區，以為改善衛生事業之初步，而樹全省衛生行政之楷模。現各該衛生實騐區成立將近四月，綜核過去工作，城市實騐區計訂有生命統計暫行規則，私厠所及旅館浴業取締規則二十八種用以改善環境衛生，編撰「衛生週刋」「衛生常識」介紹普通衛生知識，幷指示日常衛生方法，成立衛生委員會，舉辦學校衛生隊訓練，成立母親會，嬰兒保健實騐處，開辦產婆訓練班等工作，鄕鎭對實驗區計有改善環境衛生，成立母親會，衛生委員會，家庭訪問，設立診療部等工作，同時復將省立醫政學院衛生行政科，第一屆畢業生顧甦人等四人，分發至崑山，吳縣，無錫，碭山四縣為衛生技術人員，負各該縣衛生指導之責，以期衛生行政逐漸推進。</p>
<p>十·厲行禁烟禁毒　本省禁烟禁毒事宜，自二十四年九月劃歸本廳接辦以來，時僅四月，綜計辦理經過可値得而言者約有三端，一為舉辦縣戒烟所長甄審，查戒烟所之組設，原為便利烟民之傳戒投戒及調騐烟癮，所長人選，自應嚴加擇別，特於二十四年十月組織江蘇省縣戒烟所長甄容委員會，舉行公開甄審，總計應甄者共五十六人，經甄審合格准予存記者九人，已經委派者五人，現正繼續辦理，二為制定查緝烟毒及獎懲辦法，烟毒查緝工作，關係禁政前途甚巨，特派員分赴各地，專任其事，幷訂定烟毒查辦員服務及獎懲規則，提經省政府委員會通過施行，以資遵守。三為定期舉行烟民自新登記及烟毒犯總檢舉，本廳為厲行肅淸烟毒犯起見，經制定烟毒犯總檢舉辦法，定於本年二月一日起開始運用保甲組織舉行總檢舉，同時幷為恤刑愼獄起見，復經制定烟民自新登記辦法，定於本年一月一日開始准許無照烟民申請目新登記領照，其以前犯罪行為，槪准從寬免予追訴。</p>
<p>以上係就犖犖大者言之。餘如規定統一縣長獎懲辦法，整理自治區域增設政敎合一實騐區，辦理戶口異動查報，整頓倉儲，改編省水上公安隊，檢閱公安員警，油騐船艇，添造巡船，烙印公有槍枝等，均照預定辦法，切實施行。自維譾劣，黽勉以圖，待舉百端，汲深綆短，歲序更新，謹陳敎政，跂予以望開示方來</p>
<h3>一年來的商標行政</h3>
<p>— 何炳賢</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我國商標行政的歷史雖僅有卅四年，可是從未有商標行政設施而至有商標法的頒布和商標局的設立，從商標局依法掌管商標行政而至註冊商標數字之上而至中國註冊商標數字突過外國註冊商標，——事實告訴我們這一段僅乎三十多年的歷史，已替我國商標行政在各種行政設施中獲有重要的位置。作者負責我國商標行政將及四年，除依照商標法本着公正的態度，和用着敏捷的手腕處理商標的註冊和爭議外，在每個歲序更始，我必定檢討過去一年的商標行政，作成報吿，獻給社會大衆。</p>
<p>民國二十四年在國難依然嚴重和經濟極度不景氣中成了過去，在這一年中，商標行政的推進，尙幸沒有碰着什麼障礙，而且註冊商標的總數是四年來最高的，受理商標爭議案件則為四年來比較少的，不能不說是一種良好的現象。現在把這一年來的商標註冊及商標爭議，分別作成報告，其中所列的統計，因趕着發稿多半是算至十一月二十日為止，這是應得聲明的。</p>
<p>又兩年來社會各方面里視着的修改商標法問題，終於獲得適當解决，經立法院修正的現行商標法在二十四年十一月二十三日，由府令公佈了。作者雖覺商標立法與商標行政不同，可是商標法的修正給予商標行政極大影響，所以這文末尾大略提到商標法的修正。</p>
<p>商標的註冊</p>
<p>一個商標的註冊，是照着商標法第二十七條先經審定公吿六個月，沒有利害關係人提出異議然後註冊的，所以向商標局呈請註冊的商標素來分成審定商標和註冊商標兩種，註冊商標都是六個月前審定公佈的商標，我們統計二十四年度的註冊商標，因於上述的關係，於是按照商標法施行細則第三十七條商品分類，按這條是把各種商品分成七十項的）可以算出二十四年度的各國註冊總數計中國一九一四，德國三一七，英國二七四，美國二四六，日本一〇〇，法國五九，荷蘭七，瑞士一八，意國一〇，挪威五，俄國三，捷克二，奧國五，瑞典五，菲列賓三，埃及三，丹麥三，西班牙三，澳洲一，希臘四，比國一，坎拿大一，愛沙尼亞一，全年合計是二千九百八十五個，其中我國商標佔了一千九百十四個，數逮註冊商標總數三分之二，外國的註冊商標以德國為最多，計三百十七個，英國次之，美國又次之日本居四，此外法，意，荷，比諸國式數十個，或十個，或僅寥寥一兩個而已。</p>
<p>再從歷年經商標局註冊的中外商標來算一七年是二三〇○個，一八年是六六九一個，十九年是四二〇六個，二十年是三八五○個，二十一年是二四七九個，二十二年是二八四六個，二十三年是二七二九個，二十四年是二九八五個，總計到二十四年止共二八·〇八六個，十七年以前註冊的商標，已悉數包括在內，因為從十七年至廿年，所有以前註冊過的商標，都已依照全國註冊局註冊條例，查騐商標註冊證暫行章程及工商部商標局繼續辦理廣東建設廳移交商標案件暫行辦法等法規，重行註冊過了，十八十九兩年註冊商標數字之所以特別多，就為了包括這種重行註冊商標在內的緣故。</p>
<p>關於審定商標局不准註冊的商標，在二十四年共有三百三十二個，「按這個數目是算至十一月十五日為止的」現在併歷年經核駁的商標統計如下，十七至十九年三六七個，二十年三四〇個，二十一年二三二個，二十二年四〇一個，二十三年四四九個，二十四年三三二個，合計是二·一二一個。</p>
<p>商標的爭議</p>
<p>為了商標局辦理註冊的商標分成註冊商標和審定商標兩種，商標局依照商標法有權處理</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>的商標爭議案就分成評定和異議案。異議案是對審定商標的爭議，而評定案則是對註冊商標的爭議，這在商標法二十七條及第三十條都明白的規定。異議案和評定案，依法在商標局都有再審的程序，前者名異議再審查，後者名再評定，現在我們論到的商標爭議案件，就是指異議，異議再審查，評定，再評定等四種案件說的。</p>
<p>二十四年至十一月二十日止，經商標局受理的四種商標爭議案共有一百五十件，在近四年中，可說是比較少的。茲更將二十四年受理的商標爭議案件，就其爭議焦點，可分為七種　因商標圖樣近似互爭使用先後者，　因商標圖樣近似名稱相同互爭使用先後者，　因商標名稱相同互爭使用先後者，　爭論是吾公共標章問題者，　爭論商標本身應備具之條件者，　爭論商標有無他人姓名商號者，　審查員以法定職權請求評定註冊無效者照上面所說的可知商標爭議多半是由於商標名稱圖樣的同似問題，由於其他問題的却不多見，商標法第三條規定，二人以上以相同近似之商標各別呈請註冊時，應准實際最先使用者註冊」，因名稱圖樣而起的商標爭議所以特別多，就為了商標法有這條規定的緣故。</p>
<p>上面都是關於受理的商標爭議案件，至於解决的商標爭議案件在，二十四年中（包括二十三年未及解决的案件）經商標局解决的商標爭議案件共有一百五十九件，大別分為中國人對中國人，中國人對外國人，外國人對中國人，外國人對外國人四種。</p>
<p>商標局依照商標法有權處理的商標爭議事件，就是上述的異議評定等四類，而該四類爭議案有一個持定條件，就是被吿的商標必定是經過審定或註冊的，否則商標局依法不能處理。對於未呈請註冊的商標有所爭執，屬於刑事範圍，祇有法院才能審理。不過商標局在二十四年四月以前，對於未呈請註冊的商標被人控告仿冒時，也曾行過發給鑑定證明書，證明被吿商標是否與原吿已註冊商標相近似的辦法，二十四年三月三十日，實業部以商字第三三三四〇號訓令商標局停止發給鑑定證明書。商標局奉令後，隨於四月十七日通吿停辦鑑定，此後商人直接呈請鑑定商標，商標局就不予辦理，但在各級法院方面，自後民國十八年奉到司法行政部通令於受理商標訟案時，須諮詢商標局然後審判，歷年各級法院依這個通令函請商標局鑑定的商標案件，頗不少數，這種法院函請鑑定商標案，在二十四年二十有十四起，以後對於這種鑑定案件，當然是賡續辦理，不受三月三十日第三三三四號部令之拘束的。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>我們已把一年來的商標行政，大致分為商標的註冊與商標的爭議並且將幾種特殊名詞如審定，具議等，都一一加以註釋，無非是想藉此利便一般不甚明瞭商標行政情形的讀衆。又為了趕緊製成發稿的關係，有若干統計是未算足一年的，作者謹向讀者表示歉意。</p>
<p>最後應該說到的還有商標法的修正，這和未來的商標行政有極密切的關係，我們論及一年來的商標行政，自不能忽略了這剛在這年裏解决的修正商標法問題。</p>
<p>修正現行商標法的動機是兩年前已經起來的。在二十三年一年中，國內工商界和商標行政官署都在分頭討論商標法的修正問題。那年年終，商標局把經過四個月長期間討論擬成的修正草案，上呈實業部。二十四年上半年，上海各大報不斷登載關於修改商標法的文章。四月杪，行政院第二一○次會議通過商標修正草案，咨送立法院。跟着立法院便將這個草案交商法委員會審查，在十月三日和十七日，該會曾數度集會審查商標法修正草案，作者本人亦被邀列席的。十月八日，作者更在上海交通大學會見該會主席委員馬寅初氏，交換對商標法修正的意見，問題集中在　商標法第四條的除去；　商標法第三條所謂實際使用，應加「在中國境內」和「並無中斷」的限制；　商標法第一條增加「商標所用文字包括讀音在內，以國音為準」條文；　商標法第十四條擬加「圖樣」二字不加「原有」二字；　商標法第二十七條增加取締審定商標自行變換或加附記的規定等各點，當時彼此意見都很接近。十月三十一日，立法院第三十六决例會通過商標法修正案；十一月廿三日，國民政府以命令公布修正商標法；二十五日，南京中央日報揭載修正商標法全文，其內容要點如下，　舊法第一條增加指定名稱及文字包括讀音的規定；　第三條關於商標實際使用，增入「在中國境內並無中斷」的限制；　第四條全條取銷；　第十四條（修正法因第四條條文的除去，變為第十三條）第三句改為「商標專用權以呈准註冊之圖樣及所指定之商品為限」；　第十八條（條正法為第十七條末一句「抵押三字改為「為質權之標的物」七字；　第二十七條（條正法為二十六條）增入商標局得撤銷自行變換或加附記以圖影射之審定商標的規定；　第二十八條（修正法為第二十七條）增入對前條增加條文所定處分不服得以訴願的規定；　第四十一條（修正法為第三十九條）工商部字樣改為實業部。總括修正的商標法較之原來的商標法少去一條，增多三項，增字四處，改字三處，與修正草案無大出入，相信定能副合各方面的期望。</p>
<p>修正後的商標法雖經府令公佈，其施行尙有待於商標法施行細則的改訂。屬稿時商標局還在縝密硏究施行細則改訂草案中，將來實業部正式改訂公布後，一定是與修正的商標法同日施行的，但那是二十四年以後的事了。</p>
<p>二十五年元旦，於上海</p>
<h3>民國廿五年元旦吳市長吿市民書</h3>
<p>鐵城忝長本市，茲已四稔；關於過去本市之施政方針，每値歲首，例有陳述。今當二十五年新歲，序幕開展之日，回顧旣往，策勵來茲；循省職守，彌用奮感。爰乘此會，再布誠悃；用期自勵，幷共勉焉。</p>
<p>四年以來，可謂本市設治以來最較艱困之時會。鐵城困心衡慮，堅苦自勵；對內對外，因時因地，凡所興革，頭緒萬端。深賴地方賢達之匡助，全市市民之合作，以及本府各局處同仁之恊力，用是雖於地方多故，財政竭蹶之中，尙能稍有建樹，此誠深用感慰者也。</p>
<p>就時間的階段言，第一年為戰區復興年，是年工作重心，在力圖秩序之恢復，人心之安定；以及災黎之救濟，戰區之復興。第二年為市中心區建設年，時本市元氣漸復，遂遵循總理遺敎，毅然進謀市中心區之漸進發展。第三年為文化建設年，是年工作方針，仍本積極建設之旨，努力於各種文化事業之次第興建。第四年為社會建設年，除繼續建設市中心區外，尤致力於社會福利事業之推進，與强迫識字敎育之實現。雖穩重之士，因深怵於本市環境困難，財力不濟，頗有以暫維現狀為言者；鐵城獨不自量，力排衆議，毅然從事於各種新政與業務之創建。蓋以本市承戰亂之後，瘡痍滿目；非有非常之建設，實不足以恢復固有之元氣；且以本市地位之重要，其復興與發展，自與整個民族復興，國家建設之大業，有休戚相關之聯系；故受命以來，曾未敢一日因循苟安，稍怠其職守。雖力不從心，容有未逮；此心耿耿，固無時不圖本市之復興建設也。</p>
<p>此就縱的時間過程，加以概括說明也；若再就橫的業務種類，加以具體分析；此固有待專門的報吿，茲亦可為簡要之說明：</p>
<p>一、關於復興戰區者——一二八事變以後，滬北一帶，幾成灰燼。當此空前浩刧之後，各項復興工程，卽着手進行。如吳淞區，江灣區之道路溝渠；以及閘北區之寳山路，鴻典路，寳興路，寳昌路，虬江路等，以及其他橋樑，駁岸，交通幹道之修建所費實屬浩繁。而收拾燼餘，救濟災黎，尙不在內焉。</p>
<p>二、關於工務者——四年來之工務建設，尤屬艱鉅，合道路，橋樑，水利，塘工，以及各種公共建築而統計之，所費的近一千萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>三、關於公用者——除給水進步，交通發展以外；滬南一帶自碼頭改良添建以後，使用旣便，並泊日增，凡吃水十四英尺，長三百英尺之鉅輪，均可停泊。此與南市之發展，不無裨益。</p>
<p>四、關於衛生者——鐵城因鑒於市民體格之孱弱，故於衛生建設，亦頗注意。四年以來，除努力戰區消毒及防疫工作外，對於醫院，診療所，戒毒所，衛生試騐所，衛生事務所之建設，亦不遺餘力。總計所費，除經常費一百三十六萬元外，所有建築設備戒毒醫藥各項，當亦在一百四十餘萬元之譜。</p>
<p>五、關於敎育者——本市敎育建設，可分兩方面言之。一曰敎育改造，擬以改造學風，振發士氣，增加國民生產能力為指歸；經於去年指定的欵，幷組織學校建設委員會，負責進行。二曰敎育普及，現正由識字敎育委員會，努力於强迫識字敎育運動之推進，此當已為、市民所其見者矣。</p>
<p>六、關於文化者——上海為全國文化之中心，且係舉世馳譽之鉅埠；惟於圖書館，博物館，運動塲諸種種重要公共建築，迄今猶付缺如，殊不能予市民以心身修養之慰藉。市府有鑒及此，故於財力支絀之秋，特毅然從事建設；抑亦足使各邦人士，來遊本市者，得認識我族創造文化之能力與精神也。</p>
<p>七、關於社會者——社會建設，為二十四年度之主要工作；其中尤以平民新村之建築為其特徵。現代各國都市，僅努力於物質之畸形發展，而於一般平民生活，類都未能兼顧。伏誦總理建國之遺敎，旣以民生為首要；則吾人於大上海計劃建設之行程中，自當於此特加注意。自去歲設計以來，各處建築，尙能如期完工；幷專設平民福利事業委員會，主持其事。冀使本市平民生活，無論物質，精神，智識，能力方面，均能提高；而於新生活運動之要旨，亦擬於此新村環境中，力圖其貫澈焉。</p>
<p>除上述各項以外，他如虹橋飛機塲，龍華飛行港之建造增闢，市保安處之添置；公安行政之改良整飭；市中心區之計劃發展，臨時市參議會之提前成立。凡此種種，或則有利交通，或則有裨於市政；或為確保本市之治安，或為懃謀地方賢達之合作，四年以來，亦莫不積極圖之，雖因此支出激增，財政竭蹶；亦仍力謀挹注，以求貫澈。</p>
<p>惟是本市面積遼闊，非特大上海計劃之實現，工作浩繁；且以屛蔽首都，綰轂南北，其地位之重要，及與中央關係之密切，允超越尋常都市。値茲歲首，繼往開來，果將如何策勵，以負荷此重大之使命，而開始本年度之工作乎？關於此層，除責成各局處，各就其主管業務另定精密專門具體可行之計劃外，茲復擇要舉之如左：</p>
<p>一、積極建築本市農工商高級初級職業學校。</p>
<p>二、積極建築市中心區完善男女中學各一所。</p>
<p>三、就高行眞如陸行漕涇等區，各就環境之需要，積極開關農塲學校四所，使致力於農事之改進，以及集體農塲之實騐。</p>
<p>四、市圖書館，博物館積極籌備，幷確定常年經費正式開幕。</p>
<p>五、市立醫院及衛生試騐所籌劃開辦。</p>
<p>六、添建衛生事務所。</p>
<p>七、改善環境衛生。</p>
<p>八、實施勞工衛生。</p>
<p>九、改進人力車夫生活。</p>
<p>十、建造南市閘北公共大禮堂。</p>
<p>十一、建築火葬塲。</p>
<p>十二、積極開辦浦東自來水廠。</p>
<p>十三、視財政情形，計劃籌建環市電車。</p>
<p>十四、視財力所及，繼續興修東西海塘。</p>
<p>十五、籌備舉行全國國產大展覽會，以期提倡國貨，繁榮市區。</p>
<p>十六、計劃籌建浦東大橋，以救目前上海畸形發展之病態，而期南市與浦東平衡之發展與繁榮。</p>
<p>總之，四年來上海市政之特徵，厥為復興與建設，而今後工作之動向，自當仍本歷年一貫之旨趨，以及敎，養，衛，三者兼施之原則，確立具體之計劃，繼求加速的進展。務使本市之將來，成為精神物質完美無缺之理想都市；尤期於整個民族復興，國家建設之過程中，得為一有力的單位，堪負其艱鉅之使命。此則鐵城所自勵，尤盼全市市民，共賜匡助者也。中華民國廿五年元旦</p>

<p>羅馬　一般人以為意相墨索里尼之聲明、謂英法和平方案不能符合意國之最低要求、而國聯復不願超過巴黎建議之範國、故以後如有建議、對於意國或將不能再如此寬大、至於墨氏所稱意國軍隊已自往日之邊境、進佔一百七十公里云云、軍事專家謂、墨氏如無特製之地圖、則必用橡皮尺云、（卅日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國總理兼外長賴伐爾今日聲稱、彼之外交政策、暫時對於意阿爭端、將不再調解、對於油禁問題、則將合作、惟亦不從事提倡、大致將遵從傳統之法國政策、卽　維持國聯盟的、作為法國國際法律之樞紐、　在國聯範圍以內、利用集團安全條的、增强國防、及　視英法合作為歐洲安全之必要的成分云、對於意阿衝突、則賴氏之政策將為消極的期待、故意相墨索里尼及阿皇必須先取和平步驟、同時賴氏希望墨氏不久可以咨詢條約簽字國家之方法、重開交涉、因意國征阿軍事、已進行稍緩、且國聯之對意制裁、亦漸見效力、現在意國之外匯問題、已日形嚴重、如墨氏不能借到所需之欵項、則勢須减少軍費云、（卅日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　每日快報頃載稱、意相墨索里尼、昨在閣議席上、報吿該國曾與德奧匈比四國、締結財政恊定、此項協定、聞係規定抵帳辦法、俾使各該國在意國所有之債權、得以有所利用、不致因意國實行統制匯兌政策、而呆滯不動、該報又云、關於意阿爭端、預料將由「歐洲最小之一國」、根據英法兩國最近所提之和平方案、向意國提出媾和條件、意相墨索里尼、將於阿國雨季之前、加以接受云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英法德之關係</h3>
<p>柏林　法國內閣總理賴伐爾日昨在衆議院說明外交政策時、曾涉及法德兩國關係、其言有曰、「法德兩國、一日不能互相提携、則歐洲和平、卽一日不能取得保障」、此間政界人士、頃加以評論云、法俄兩國互助恊定、若由法國國會加以批准、則法德兩國關係、卽無切實改善之可能、政府機關報、「政治外交通信報」載稱、「賴伐爾具有誠意、吾人並不懷疑、特有善意、而無適當行動以副之、仍恐於事無濟耳、法俄兩國暨蘇俄捷克兩國所簽訂之互助恊定、均以德國為對象、德國因之疑懼不已、卽在賴伐爾發表演說之後、其不安之念、仍無以消釋之、法俄互助恊定、原與國聯會盟約精神相抵觸、其對於德國、又預先指定為侵略國、各方面關於國際妥恊、雖有所努力、此非所以鼓勵之緣、眞正提携、惟在相互信任之環境中、乃能予以實現故也」云云、（三十日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>巴黎　據事業報外交記者宣稱、英國駐法大使克拉克、曾於昨日午後、訪晤賴伐爾總理兼外長、聞兩人曾就最近英國駐德大使費潑斯爵士與德國希特勒元首會晤、暨英國新任外相艾登明日自約克郡返抵倫敦視事兩節、有所談及、此外尙對海軍會議中之問題、加以討論、緣法國海軍部長庇德利、近曾宣稱、法國不願維持華盛頓條約所規定之比率制度、英國一聞此言、以為法日兩國見解接近、於此可見一斑、是以大感不安、英人更以為、法國一面主張英德海軍噸位、應維持一百與三十五之比、一面則反對比率制度、顯屬自相矛盾、昨日克拉克大使與賴伐爾總理所談者、殆卽為此、（三十一日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>倫敦　一般人相信英國駐德大使費潑斯爵士、日昨訪問德國外交次長布洛夫、曾就德國與立陶宛國相互關係有所商談、按立陶宛米美爾區域執政府、係由德意志黨所主持、立陶宛籍各官吏、多已罷免、德國宣傳機關、對於執政府又多所壓迫、此間一般人深恐立陶宛輿論因而傾向蘇俄、並主張加入蘇維埃聯邦、亟欲加以調處、至德國與立陶宛之間、原有各項懸案、例如交換政治犯問題、卽其一端、德國對於某種政治犯、其國籍屬於德意志者、亦不願予以容納、卽屬爭點所在、英國大使與德國外交次長布洛夫會唔時、尤注重此層、（三十日哈瓦斯）</p>

<p>巴黎　現任農業部長前總理泰狄歐、今日辭去中央共和黨之黨籍、因該黨要求法國對意採取强硬行動云、按該黨為泰氏所組織、成立於一九三二年、當時因左翼共和黨中有多數黨員不能遵守黨規、而投票反對赫里歐政府、故有此組織、（卅日國民電）</p>

<h3>兒童教育小說　小男兒　（一）（四）（一）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>那蛇確很有趣，後來又窮追着一個蹩腳的老鴉，好容易把它捉住，這些事佔據了韜摩的時間和心思，因此他一點也不去想到他的錢，直到那晚安睡在床上之後方始記到。</p>
<p>『不打緊，只有乃德知道它的所在，』那個大意的童子說了，便沉沉睡去，了不担心到他財產的安全。</p>
<p>明早，童子們正要開始上課的時候，韜摩喘着氣奔進敎室裏，責問道：</p>
<p>『大家請聽，是誰拿了我的錢去？』</p>
<p>『你講什麼話來？』拂朗問道。</p>
<p>韜摩於是說明了一切，乃德又設明了他的話。</p>
<p>別的人個僩都聲言他們對這事是了無所知的，大家的臉色漸漸懷疑到乃德，他呢，愈吾認，郤愈慌亂，也愈驚恐。</p>
<p>『總有一個人拿去的，』朗說道，一面韜摩當着大家揮着拳，暴怒聲言道：</p>
<p>『我今天發誓在這裏，一朝我提到那個賊骨頭，我要他嘗嘗我的生活才知道。』</p>
<p>『且安靜些罷，韜摩；我們總會把他找出，賊骨頭總沒有好結果的，』唐恩說道，好像他對這其間是知道一些兒的。</p>

<h3>證券　在多種情勢下　債巿如此過去　値得佩服者惟投機家（？）</h3>
<p>二十四年份債巿經過、頗堪回憶、略述於後、以資參考、</p>
<p>內國公債、係一種流動資產、惟其性質、恒隨環境而變化、巿値常有軒輊、且以其中不少投機、致有變相的不合理論的舉動、故終不能持久、一時為其所紿者、頗不乏人、跡一年來之經過、知投機家之機詐、實可驚人、去年變化之鉅、幾使根本發生變化、為歷年所未有、故其一年成交總數、有四十五六萬萬元之多、即每月交割、總數亦有五萬二千餘萬元、交易以九月份為最清、十一·十二兩月為最熱鬧、巿價上半年較平、下半年變動最多、茲將其關於各方面之原因結果、分別略述於後、</p>
<p>關於經濟者—自二十三年底、金融界發生恐慌、小銀行及商號之倒閉踵相接、社會經濟有崩潰之虞、現金逃避、數尤驚人、經政府之苦心孤詣、種種救濟、巿場乃有通貨膨脹、銀幣貶値、中英或中美借欵等之傅說、債券巿價賴以不墜、至十一月四日、正式公布幣制統一、現銀國有後、巿價挨搖直上、惟其高度業已超出情理之外、冬間因華北問題、及日人種種阻撓、致稍受打擊、投機家利用之、又起波濤、</p>
<p>關於政治者—二十四年份、共匪已逐步剿平、政治有清明之象、全國有統一之望、實為多年來所難得、六全大會成績尤佳、惟汪院長遇刺、不無影響、故以政治論、巿價趨高、自在意中、自華北發生問題後、政治手腕、是否可以解决、前途尚難逆料、但觀於冀東問題有解决說、未始無望、</p>
<p>關於外交者—一年中最足使人驚怖之外交問題、祗在中日關係、各省種種零星事件、不一而足、而尤以華北問題為艱鉅、知己知彼、應付不難、蔣委員長之外交宣言、可以槪括一切、債巿乃受一大衝動、</p>
<p>關於投機者—全年之投機、實最鉅且最熱烈、使人驚駭、而受其　蔽者、厥惟兩大端、春間二十三年關稅、多頭公司、抬價至九五折、當時已有確切收回業經在巿流通之二千餘萬現貨、空頭之焦頭爛額、前所罕見、而不旋踵竟至大崩潰、一月間高低巿價、相差四十餘元、此種投機、猶僅限於一種之之竭澤而漁、冬間改革幣制前後、發見大規模之多頭公司、利用法幣萬能之說、致有將債券全部收回、或則提高巿價合息八厘、甚至於空者、將受嚴密之稽核、此種情形、經過一月有半、而仍轉下游、所傅種種不　幻泡影、此種投機、其危險可懼、其魂力亦足欽佩矣、</p>
<p>以上四種情形、不過舉其犖犖大者、略述梗槪、惟二十四年份發行之債券雖多、均未上場賣買、故市場籌碼方面、不致再有極度鬆濫之虞、一年經過、大都如此、其變動雖不多而極鉅大、數年來所未見、投機之術、愈趨愈巧、其範圍亦愈趨愈大、亦可以見商業之凋弊、存僥倖而投機日益增加、此殊非社會經濟之好現象也、</p>
<h3>大戶不斷賣出債券　—散戶有起而補空—</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、為廿四年份最後一日之交易、環境上如日商擬用日幣顯有碍於吾國法幣之統一、美銀慘跌、迄尚無法挽回、債券减息謠言、依然傅說紛紜、大戶仍不斷賣出、惟散戶因新年有三日之休業、抵空者頗不乏人、故巿價一度跌落之後、旋即回好、遠期依然萎頓、恐尚不易振作、全日經過、頭盤跌落較鉅、廿關忽小八角、獨整六遠期好二角、次盤驟漲、鹽稅狂漲九角半、午後兩盤、互有漲跌、大都了結及掉期交易為多、賣戶三十三·四十八及五十四號等仍係一一貫政策、始終不懈、前途尚難樂觀、巿價結果、大多數回好一二角至五六角、惟九關金短、小五分至二角、成交總數、共計一千九百六十一萬元、元旦起至三日止、停巿三天、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紐約股票一致上騰</h3>

<h3>中國之制茶事業（五）</h3>
<p>— 衣白</p>
<p>第二，關於　茶經營機構上急　改良者</p>
<p>甲，統制輸出</p>
<p>中國制茶工廠，其數量上殊多，而其規模則殊小，以致出口參差，而所費之成本實大，欲求　茶在國際貿易上發展，既不適國際標準之大量需求，且中國各茶商已負甚重之負擔。不僅如此，中國茶業者因缺乏貿易機關，對外輸出，必須經茶販，茶行，茶棧茶買辦，洋行，等層層剝削而始能抵達國際市場，此等負擔，如經營檢查業者欲轉嫁於消費者，則勢必提高價格，但海外有比　茶價格更低之茶在活動，其勢必敗；然如果不欲轉嫁於消費者，則本身之成本太重，如此中國之茶業安得不敗?欲避免此種弊害，除編製輸出外別無他途。編製輸出有如下優點：一，可以統一華茶品質，免為國外消費者所懷疑；二，供需之　量可以平衡，免致供過於求或求過於供之弊；三，直接抵達國際市場之時間與金錢均為經濟，可避免販賣為生者從中撈取一轉手勞之層層剝削，如此成本比較減輕，價格比較可低，貿易即容易活動。</p>
<p>乙，減輕各種茶稅</p>
<p>政府與人民，本為一體。人民納稅，原為天賦之職。但在人民生活發生困難之際，政府非但不徵其稅，並得助其生活安定，　此即政府對人民應盡之職，亦即人民納稅政府之根本意義也。蓋政府無健全之國民經濟，即不能生存。據一九三五年七月十五日時事新報載：「實業部據祁門茶　產銷合作社聯合社呈請代同皖省府接洽，豁免茶葉捐五年，現經皖省府咨溃视杳舛悾┮栽摬枞~產銷合作社聯合社所屬七合作社所產者為限」。如政府認為可以全國豁免，或減輕，則中國茶葉或有甦生希望。但此尚不為一種至為消極之救濟政策，最好由政府負責編製全國茶葉之產銷，則更為徹底，更為有望。</p>
<p>總之，以上所舉各點，均屬一種綱要，如果實行起來，則尚須專家為之擬具詳細計畫，在此處須重申者，即中國茶葉因天惠獨厚，其品質，特別是綠茶，各國不能及，故中國經營茶葉如果努力改良，則世界之市場，尚在等待華茶之馳騁也。　（完）</p>

<h3>新年的話</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>快樂的新年，又在人們的歡呼聲中降臨了，我得在這里先向大家道個恭喜</p>
<p>！今天我本有許多話要說，但因為一時太興奮了，所以不知道應從何處講起？</p>
<p>現在不妨就把想出來的幾件事情，拉雜的寫在下面，作為我元旦的獻詞：</p>
<p>從世界說，今年是所謂危機的一九三六年。這個警告我們早已聽到，而</p>
<p>且又看見列强預先在整軍經武，以備應付這未來的大難。現下这個凶年眞的來</p>
<p>了，各方面的情绪，自是更形緊張，彼此在注視這危機的開展。依情形看，世</p>
<p>界大局，今日已是險惡萬分，戰事一觸卽發。人類的浩劫，也許就要臨頭了！</p>
<p>在中國，今年是市民國貨年。國貨年已往曾舉行過二决，郎婦女國貨年和</p>
<p>學生國貨年。這二個國貨年，實行的結果，雖未得到滿意的成續。但一方因主</p>
<p>倡人的熱心宣傳，他方因人民的努力贊助，所以對於國貨的推銷，也有不少的</p>
<p>影響。我國每年外貨入超很鉅，至堪痛心。救濟之道，非國人一致服用國貨，</p>
<p>實無以挽回利權。因此，我們奉友一般市民，从今天起大家实行服用国货，</p>
<p>使今年的國貨年，能此過去的國貨年，更見出色。那末國貨的前途，也就有相</p>
<p>當的希望了！</p>
<p>今年在我國還有兩事，也是値得提出來說的。依這回五全大會的决議，國</p>
<p>府已規定本年的五月五日，頒布憲法，十一月十二日，召集全國國民大會。這</p>
<p>二事久為全國人民所渴望，現在果然將要實現了，這是很可欣幸的。大家趕快</p>
<p>展開雙臂，預備來歡迎我們的憲法和國民大會！</p>
<p>尙有必需順便一談的，是大家不要忘記今年仍是兒童年。我國的兒童年，</p>
<p>是規定自上年八月一日起，至今年七月三十一日止。所以今天一班小朋友，旣</p>
<p>逢新年，又過兒童年，有這二重慶日，自然要格外的歡天喜地了！</p>
<p>祝大家新年進步！</p>
<h3>二十四年的中國電影</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>替二十四年的中國電影結一决賬，這用意是好的。不僅應時！並且年看这一年来中国电影究竟有怎樣的一個變遷，不也是有相當意義的事；可是在這樣大題目下要寫出好文章來，在我却簡直是不可能的事，一則自己才力不够，不克當此重任；第二呢，平常雖有一些剪報材料和摘記，可是那實在太少，在這樣大題目下就不够用；第三，……</p>
<p>所以，在未寫之前，我自己就知道，在這樣大題目下，我至多祇能開出一張橫單來，讓有心於中國電影者們多一個參考的資料。</p>
<p>二十四年是中國電影界窮的年頭，每個公司都多多少少的鬧着欠薪，（雖然經過大批的裁員還是如此。)欠二三個月的還算是幸運，在一般所謂「小公司」，甚至有欠半年以上，到現在還如石沉大海的。</p>
<p>電影界的所以會如此窮，那自然跟歷年來的循環不息的外來內在的天災人禍有着極大的關係，電影並非是日常生活的必需品，在這連生活都自顧不暇的當兒，電影市塲的縮小自然是當然的事實，而另外一方面，因爲公司組織的未臻健全，經常開支太大，出品又非常緩慢，更使公司行政陷於週轉不靈的地位；而出品內容呢，在盛行着畸形的編導制和明星制度下，出品的内容，更是人云亦云千篇一律的使人疑心是一個模子裏所出來的。作者祇知道什麼「型」的片子能賣錢，便也割頭刪足的改造一遍，作爲自己的作品以應市，他們不知道擴大視野的到別個角落裏去抓取題材，更不知道藝術的地來反映現實，他們最大的本領便是模倣和抄襲。</p>
<p>由於模倣和抄襲，觀衆在看厭了人云亦云的爛調之餘，便祇有掉頭而去。</p>
<p>二十四年度的國產片，據民報「影壇」的統計一共是四十七張。—但事實上恐有誤，例如據我想得起來的大同公司的「峨嵋山下」，天一公司的「美人恩」便沒有列入，而「上海二十四小時」，則又好像是去年公映的。不過因爲我自己沒有好好地統計，所以不能確定本年度的國產片究竟是幾部。</p>
<p>在這四十七部影片中，（我們姑且根據「影譚」說呢），從內容到形式，都有着很大的差異，好的一方面，有「人之初」「鄕愁」「逃亡」「自由神」「新女性」「大路」「海葬」「船家女」「時勢英雄」等等，而莫名其妙的，也有「國風」「昏狂」黑影」……等等，而在好片與好片之間，莫名其妙的與莫名其妙的之間，又有着種種不同，這種不同的程度，如果要詳細的分析起來，却不是這簡略的短文能能畫的。我們底能抽像地說一句：二，一般地說來大都是吻合着時代的脈搏的，雖然因爲電影檢查的關係，反帝抗×的口號是不准喊了，旁的技節又零零碎碎的受了限制，（電影業的衰落，電所以還是相當的地做到了反映現實的使曲地用「象徵手法」或是「光明的尾」来傳逹他们的苦衷。雖然正因為這樣，在取材的雷同之外，更增加了千篇一律。</p>
<p>在這樣所謂「客觀環境的限制」下，比較可喜的是表現内容的技巧的進步。中國電影自從被一二八的砲火轟醒了之後，演出上的進步原是最顯明的，而二十四年度的國產片，其技七上的一般提高，則是更顯明的，這不僅是一某一部片的突出，更可喜的是一般地都提高，使中國電影，得能接近國際影壇。</p>
<p>固然，形式和內容是不能分離的，而所謂技巧上的進步，也祗是一般而非全體，在有「藝術的良心」的作者之外，有的因自身修養的不够的，他的作品還是和中國的早期電影沒進步多少，(允其是「小公司」，還更受到機械財力的困難)有的，却開倒車的向觀衆作歪曲的說敎。</p>
<p>除此之外，更痛心的是有些市儈們困國內不能立足，他們的作品受觀衆的吐棄，同時因電影檢査的關係，乘桴於海的逃避，到香港去拍神怪片，最近香港方面的神怪片和古裝歷史片(這大部份都是不折不扣的把廣東戲搬上銀幕)。的活躍，便是這些市儈們活動的結果</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>然而，觀衆是隨了時代在進步的，「火燒」之類的片子早一時期在中國不是也活躍一時嗎？現在終於被進步的觀衆所唾棄了，華南一般的觀衆的鑑賞水準雖然此較低，但是我們敢相信，在短時間內，華南的神怪片是會遭受到同樣的命運的。</p>
<p>除了無恥的市儈們逃避到華南去(這也可說是被驅逐到華南去)之外，人材的傷失也是本年度最不幸的事，認爲蚤國最能演戲的阮玲玉女士於偉大的婦女節服毒自殺了，「大路」「桃李刧」等新興歌曲的作者聶耳先生又溺死於日本，而中國電影的拓荒者鄭正秋先生也在七月間病死在上海，天一公司的演員陸麗霞，馬東武，及前聯華佈景師劉晋三等也相繼死亡，同年，優秀的導演沈西苓先生及演員宣景琳女士的脫離電影圈，更使已經荒蕪的電影園地多一重損失。</p>
<p>和死亡及出走的影人相反的，是本年度新人的崛起，在崛起的新人中，可注意並且有厚望的有：電通演員藍蘋，施超，陸霞明，導演司徒慧敏，許幸之，袁牧之等，尤其是藍蘋，從舞台劇「娜拉」起始，一直便引起愛好電影者非常的注意，雖然到現在爲止，我們還沒有看到他獨擋一面的戲。</p>
<p>另外，在舊人方面，自從「時勢英雄」和「天倫」相繼公映之後，尙冠武也成了被注意的中心，是爲難得的演員。</p>
<p>二十四年的中國電影界，它的「橫單」我想我開到此處爲止。另外方面，我還想簡略地談談本年度的業餘劇人的活躍和影評的衰落。</p>
<p>從「四春之曲」開始，從舞台走上銀幕的業餘劇人，今年公演了好幾個戲，如「娜拉」和「欽差大人」等，都替沉寂了的戲劇運動增加了不少活力。</p>
<p>關於業餘劇人的演話劇，有些人是以爲它會妨害影業的發展，（主要的是妨害工作進行。)但是我的意見可並不如此，我以爲，祗要對於工作進行沒有多大的妨礙，（事實上是也不會有過大的妨害的。（公演話劇不僅使話劇空氣活躍，演員的演技可以養成更洗鍊精緻，在消極的作用上，還能多可解除不良的嗜好。</p>
<p>影評的衰落是和本年度電影事的衰落相彷而且相關的，最大的原因也是不能說話，有限度的說話的結果，是概念地成爲公式化，不成爲公式化，便變成純技巧的批評，這樣，一方面是和社會隔離開來，而一方面是走入更專門難摸的路上。</p>
<p>除上述無意識的錯誤之外，有的是因本身的修養不够而笑話百出，有的則更居心叵測的使人不敢深思。</p>
<h3>新年憶舊</h3>
<p>— 英光軍</p>
<p>過新年，實在是作孩子時代最高興不過的事情，那時候，穿上新鮮的衣裳，鞋襪帽子完全換新，把自己變成一個新人，預備過新年。過新年，便不忘記那時的好處：媽媽給點錢，自己可以隨便到外面化用，於是再望見糖菜擔，花生瓜子梨小床子，就不至像平常日手里一文無有的受窘了。拿出一兩個小錢，就換回一些食物。小孩子還有不喜歡吃零東西的麼。有時候來了客人，放下幾個「歲錢」，哭着喊着向媽媽討，一定等討到手才肯走開去。因爲媽媽從前所說的「保存起來，留將來用」的話，已經成了不兌現的支票，事實同經歷早經證明媽媽收了錢去全藏了起來，以後再也不拿出來用。</p>
<p>新年大概不少新氣象，但在故鄉那可掃興得很，因爲氣侯太不帮忙人。現在所說的新年，該說是眞正「新」的年，兒時所過的新年，不論在時間上或是現今的名目上來說，那全是「舊」的年了；過去了的新年，當然是「舊」的：從前的新年是舊曆年，也就是現在所說的舊年，當然也該算是「舊」的。故鄕每逢過新年，正是隆冬時分，泳雪載地，天氣嚴寒，十天半月見不到一個晴天，除了觸眼白壁山河外，再見不到碧野，綠樹和土色的大地——這還有什麼新的氣象！完全是死氣沉沉的！吐一口痰到雪地上就凍就冰，伸出手，手指凍得僵僵的，天氣已然把新的氣象掩飾住的。好在同氣候習慣了的人，同寒冷混熟，也就不管那些了，所以常常結成三五成羣的夥伴，到小河的泳面上去滑冰，在泳面上黏牢砲竹燃放，有時滑倒了，弄得滿身白雪，便引起大家的嘻笑。放砲竹，是</p>
<h2>Page 32</h2>
<p>新年中孩子們的樂事，那一種淸脆的響聲是何等鈎人！明知那是有危險的玩意兒，却願意接近它，玩弄它，而且大家</p>
<p>還以放砲竹的本領强弱來判定你爲人的果敢與儒弱！</p>
<p>故鄕的新年中也不能說完全沒有新氣象，除了人們的衣服更換比平日淸新這伴事之外，例如貼春聯，貼門神，掛錢，大紅布匹香頭紙一些東西全是新鮮的，就以那些「新年吉慶」，「抬頭見喜」，「五榖豐登」，「連升三級」的對聯來說，又有多麼新鮮！就連猫狗也似乎顯得比平日活躍，新鮮呢。</p>
<p>小時候最盼望過新年，有新鮮玩意兒可看固然是其中之一，像唱秧哥，耍龍燈，踏高蹺一些個，此外，飲食的特別比平日豐富，也實在是呌人喜悅切盼的原因。平常日，家里飲食吃得很壞，來客人時雖然換了好菜好飯，但那又輪不到孩子們的名下，私心里雖然不滿，却無法加以諫阻，就只有把口食上不滿意處全指望在新年了。家里新年從元旦一直過到元霄節後才止，這期間眞是呌人不忘的「黃金時代」。</p>
<p>實際上，從十二月二十三日起——家鄕所謂的小年，已經就在過年換飯食了，直到月底是「忙年期段」一些作豆腐，蒸饅頭，殺猪，宰羊，裝香斗，貼春聯事情全在這幾天中作，一個新年算一算就要過上二十多天。</p>
<p>兒時所過的新年，現在回想起來，常有些發笑不止的事情，現在却是再也追不回來了。至於故鄉人們這幾年的新年是怎樣過着的，是吾也過兩個新年，是吾經濟能力還容許他們大吃大嚼的和從前一般快樂，現在全不得而知了。</p>
<p>我猜想，現在的新年大概故鄉方面十分之九的人全該是不快樂的。</p>
<h3>關店</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>吃過中飯，店堂里就坐滿？討債的人？他們都是各個來往客家的伙計，鐵靑了面孔，說話總是駡聲帶氣的有的竟是槌檯拍桌？好像要和母親動武似的。爲了店里生意淸淡，中秋節父親就有收歇的意思，但是鄉下的慣例，不到年底，放出去的賬是收不回來的，而欠着人家的賬，要是開門的話，就得淸償他們。現在離年底還有三天，可是父親决意收歇的消息傳出之後，那些要賬的人就恐怕我們逃了似的，每天吃過中飯，店堂就坐滿；那些鐵着了面孔的伙計。父親因爲要追討欠賬，都是一淸早就出門，要到夜半才回店。本來年底是店里生意最忙的時候，往年總得臨時拆個伙計來帮忙，而討賬的職務也歸之二叔。父親，一個伙計，我和母親帶帮一點小忙，在中午時分有時還是應付不了上門的主顧。鄉下雖然地面狹小，過年總得上一點貨，而到城里去辦貨呢，旣要他費一筆航船錢，而且當夜是不能回來。我們這爿小小的雜貨店，在這個時候，就預先受了他們的託付，到城里去採辦來賺一點回佣，生意是無論如何做得過去的。但是今年爲了大哥在城里讀書，二叔搬到城里去住了；二叔是父親的一條手臂。夏天外祖父又過世，母親家里祇有外祖母一個人；外祖母已是七十多歲的人，母親不放心她也時常回到家里去住，店里通常是父親一個人了，如果常年，僱佣一個伙計，父親以爲太不合算，和二叔幾度商議之後，就决意把這小店收歇，也搬到城里去住。可是外面是不知道這底細的，收歇的消息一傳出，欠賬的賴着，要賬的却拚命追討。父親忙了半個多月，還是空跑的决數多，他們的藉口都是到年底償淸，收回來的賬總是不敷欠人的。母親對於店里銀錢出入是向來不管的，那些伙計駡聲帶氣的咆哮，母親祇有和氣同他們商量。但是這個勢口關店總是欠理的，越是和氣同他們商量，越以爲我們沒有錢償債，有幾個蠻橫的伙計，竟是要檢査我們的錢櫃，和沒收我們的底貨作償了。我是被他們作爲孩子看待的，實在我也說不來話，母親弄得沒有辦法，把來往的賬簿，攤了出來，由他們去結算，費了好大的唇舌敷衍他們一個個出們，他們還是不信任的說我們開着花賬，有這末好的生意爲什麼要收歇店鋪呢？</p>
<p>生意自然沒有了，人就是那樣勢利，卽鄰居親友也寗願乘航船到城里去辦貨。「在這個年頭兒關店總是不吃香的！」父親這幾天老是發着牢騷：「如果人欠欠人弄淸楚，我還可以開這樣一爿店呢！」但是有什麼用呢，每天奔跑着，耍回來的賬總不够支配債項。天又連綿地下着雨，父親每天回店弄了一身泥水，把搭袋（收賬的錢袋）櫃檯上一摔，他幾乎要倒下去似的蹌進店堂，要在靠上老半天，才重鼓起勇氣來計算今天的賬目。母親一邊打面水，洗脚水，皺着眉說；</p>
<p>「先向二叔借一點錢來還淸了債，人家欠的過了年慢慢去收！開店眞不容易呢！」</p>
<p>父親向她望了一眼，苦笑着回答：「開店不容易？就是爲了不開店，你記得往年有這樣的情形嗎？放的賬二十五六邊都來還淸了，欠的賬卽是遲到大年三十夜，也沒有一盞燈籠上門呢！關店在這個年頭兒總是不吃香的！好像我就要破產似的，哼，這些人！」父親看着我呆立地站在一旁，就撫着我的頭髮說：「記着，好好地和大哥到城里去讀書，將來也不用開什麼牢什子的店了，一個中學畢業生可以抵前淸一個舉人呢，！」</p>
<p>說着他笑笑。這是父親的希望，但是希望終究落了空，直到父親死後到現在，我從大學畢業出來，母子二個過着比關店時更艱苦的生活，在自己應付每個年關時，我不由地想起十年前關店時的那幕情形來，那些咆哮着的討債人的鐵靑的臉，又一個個地在我面前浮動了。</p>
<h3>過年</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>六點鐘，車問裏的放工鈴聲響了，一片嘈雜的鋼鐵機輪旋轉磨擦聲憂然而止。張阿奎從柱上取下破穢的短大衣，隨着夥伴兒出了車間，把打鳥帽揑在手裏，亦不去老虎灶前抹臉洗手，亦沒把肩上的烟灰拍一拍，就那樣痴呆呆的彳亍於廠長辦公室門口，沉鬱着臉，搏着冬夜的寒風。</p>
<p>在抹臉洗手的夥伴兒都有着一種譏笑的口吻：『瞧他的面子大，能借至錢！昨天王和尙幾乎對廠長叩頭，說着接二連三的好話，結果却被罵了一頓。』</p>
<p>『就是原料間的小董，今天早上向會計處預支一月薪俸還沒准許，我們做一天算一天的工人還用開口！』</p>
<p>『可不是嗎，廠裏假使肯體卹我們這輩苦命鬼，早就不會把五分一塊的年賞取消，十二月份的雙工取消，張阿奎這傢伙記性亦太壞，他忘記了爲着爭年賞而被廠長打耳光，他今夜還向他借錢，瞧他的大面子！嘿嘿……』</p>
<p>可是，張阿奎並沒忘記這點，他委實沒有法子啊，新年停工三天，三天沒有工錢拿，一家的吃用可不能因新年而停止，那房東的臉，那放印子錢的小老三的臉委實太可怕了。往年除夕，還有雙工和年賞可以抵當，多下些，還可以買點刀口肉，買一尾死白鰱，糴幾升米，今年可「行船上岸』了。今夜總得硬着頭皮向廠長求求情。張阿奎心腔裏燃燒着希望的火……</p>
<p>全廠的工人都捏着空拳頭走了，留下了寂寞的廠房，與一片陰晦。</p>
<h3>恭買新禧！</h3>
<p>但從廠長室麻沙玻璃窗閃出來的，却是一片耀眼的光輝。算珠聲是淸脆的，笑聲是暢朗的，還有那女接綫生的淸晰和悅的言語。汽車夫有一决沒一决在門裏進進出出，一綑綑高貴的新年用品往廠門口汽車上搬，張阿奎知道廠長就快出來，把剛戴上的打鳥帽又脫下。他在猶豫，還是盡情顯出可憐之色，或强制着憂愁，勉强扮着迎合的笑容？？？</p>
<p>廠長翻着皮大衣領，含着雪茄出來了。張阿奎終於掛着憂鬱的笑走上去。『廠長先生，今天回公館晏啦嘿嘿嘿……』</p>
<p>『你不知道是除夕嗎，糊塗東西，蠢蟲！』廠長踱着閒適的步子。</p>
<p>『，是是，廠長先生，懇求你開開恩，借我十塊錢吧，今夜，今夜，今夜……』</p>
<p>『錢，錢，那裏來？就是銀行亦打烊啦，開了年再說！』接着——</p>
<p>『碰』的，汽車門關上，廠長和一大綑一大綑高貴的新年用品，在急轉的輪軸上飛似的去了。廠裏又散出十幾個淸瘦臉貌的職員，挾着幾捲月份牌，日曆之類的廣告印刷品，或許，這就他們今夜的所獲吧？，凄凉地互相說着開年會吧。』便各自走着回家的路。可是張阿奎空着手在這辛苦了一年的最後一夜。</p>
<p>大街上有人在放花砲，行人也比較熱鬧，光亮的年紅火管前張着『恭賀新禧』的金字。然而，張阿奎心中希望的火是熄滅了，一片無涯的陰黯和空虛。</p>

<p>開篇一新年歌</p>
<p>淡蕩春風處處和。萬家邊砲萬家鑑。新年初四運初五。五路財神迎接多。福祿三星無不有。鷄魚猪肉滿盤鋪。松毛柏子冬靑葉。辭歲迎神不可無。萬戶千門俱敬重。路頭菩薩無功夫。窮人家未必親身到。利市招財替代多。有燭有香常到到。無茶不酒冷疏疏。眞乙玄壇終怕到。金輪如意不貪圖。我家要接財神日。五日端陽勿在乎。聞說鍾馗嫁妹子。路頭菩薩討家婆。因此得知鍾進士。至親郎舅兩稱呼。妻親舅</p>
<p>。胞妹夫。自然有事說帮扶。定與內兄稱壽誕安排公份奏笙歌？財帛使司亦有分。大家决不看輕我。大發財源快如梭。</p>

<p>開篇「新年歌」</p>
<p>臘去春回萬象新。歲朝天氣更淸明。家家齊把桃符換。鑼鼓聲中祝太平。大家小戶都歡樂。聲聲恭喜笑盈盈。有的是，溫酒一杯家庭樂。門生故舊共談心。有的是，笙簫弦管歌一曲。卿吹短笛我吹笙。有的是，握管題紅取吉語。稱心如意四時亨。有的是，淸興八圈把和來碰。消閒不必講輸贏。有的是，雙雙携手游春去。卿卿我我倍多情。有的是，俏皮兒童把小砲甩。一聲一響一心驚。路上游人多於鯽。件件衣衫耀眼睛。其實是，新年原是舊人物。何必衣衫件件新。雖則相沿稱習俗。也算得，一年一度一開心。若無新年來點綴。大除夕，結帳總管結勿淸。我願大家從頭起。共謀建設莫談兵。一年之計在於春。</p>

<h3>新道奇汽車特色一斑</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>一九三六年式新道奇六缸汽車。業於日前運抵此間。新車自經本埠經售商。中國汽車公司。陳列樣子間。公開展覽以來。汽車界人士競往參觀。並皆大加讚美。極表滿意。新車式樣美妙達於極點。裝璜富麗無比。至於搆製之堅强鞏固。與夫機械效用之宏偉卓絕。尤爲出色當行。允稱傑搆。茲將新車特色之犖犖大者。略述如决。以見一斑。</p>
<p>專利式浮力引擎托架　惟其採用此種托架。故所有引擎顚震。於傳達車架或車身之前。卽已消失無餘。於是置身車中。自更舒暢適意。而發動機之壽命。亦必因而延長。至於經久耐用。與維持費用之减省。自更不言可知。</p>
<p>眞正水壓塞車動作敏妙而準正。制動力量均及於四輪。如遇緊急關頭。可保萬無一失。按水壓塞車。爲道奇所首先採用。歷經種種嚴格測騐。確實瞪明其爲最美妙而切實用之車制。</p>
<p>汽油機油與維持費胥極經濟合算之至。故每一英里之駕駛。均可於金錢上獲得相當之節省。著名“Red　“Rad日引擎。爲道奇所獨有。其功用之宏偉。允駕一九三五年式道奇引擎而過之。</p>
<p>道奇安全鋼車身　凡重視安全者。當無不樂用此種絕對可靠之道奇鋼車身。道奇新車。因採用彌極鞏固之車架。故其車身較前允爲堅强。按道奇自廿一年前最先應用鋼車身以來。迄今於鋼質車身搆製方面。道奇固始終榮居領袖地位也。</p>
<p>駕車疾馳不啻憑虛御風　按此種駕駛。惟極昂貴之車輛容或有之。今則道奇以若斯經濟合算之代價。而能具有輪行如飛之特色。此其所以彌極可貴也</p>
<p>駕駛操縱得心應手無論轉向掉排制動加速及運用接合器等任何動作。道奇新車。均極得心應手。毫不吃力。此新道奇之駕駛安全敏妙。與樂趣盎然。所以爲向來所未有。抑且逈不可及也。</p>
<h3>一九三六年式喜臨門新車到申</h3>
<p>已到樣車二輛　大批日內續到</p>
<p>喜臨門小寳寳汽車，素以式樣玲瓏，搆製精巧，爲世人所稱道，今則一九三六年式新車，允足使人驚奇艷羨讚美不置，兼以購置成本與經常維持費用而言，喜臨門新車，固明明屬於輕便汽車類也，但若以其舒適便利效用與設備精美等而論，則喜臨門小寳寳，實與大號汽車無稍異，喜臨門新車，且有、永久安靜無聲之流錢化新車身，與彌極堅强鞏固之新式底盤架，內部寬敞舒適，所有車中乘客，完全安坐於輪距之間，有隨意俯仰屈伸之樂，無絲毫顚簸傾側之苦，至其機械工程，較前允大進步，故不僅機力彌滿充實，抑且絕對安全可靠，此外允足述者，其裝璜之華麗，式樣之美妙，與夫全部比例之勻稱，概與大汽</p>
<p>車一般無二，而其汽油機油等銷耗量之經濟，則絕對爲一小汽車，此其所以彌足珍貴，倍覺可愛也，此項新車，現由本埠靜安寺路九九三號大陸汽車公司經售，現已到有樣車二輛，至於大批新貨，不日卽可續到云，（敷)</p>
<p>美國福特汽車公司總理愛特賽福特，最近捐贈我國江西敎會鄕村服務團之福特救護車一輛，上海福特汽車公司經理克汝君代表愛德賽，將車上鑰匙交與南昌醫院主任喜福醫師之情形。</p>
<h3>海外汽車談片</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>今年美國銷車預估　光陰眞快。一九三六年又開始了。美國的汽車界鉅子。對於本年的產銷兩方都抱着很熱烈的希望。他們看着前途是很樂觀的。不但對於汽車事業如此。就是其他各業也都有重復繁榮之望。並且拿汽車事業的發達。作爲其他實業繁榮的測騐哩。最近據奧奔汽車公司總理福克納氏的見解。他預估着一九三六年的美國新車銷數。當超過三百萬輛之譜。又據目下統計。現在美國正在使用中的汽車其總數達二二，〇○○，〇〇〇輛。其中的二〇，〇〇〇，〇○〇輛使用的已一年之久，此外的四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。使用至少已屆八年。因此塡舊的銷數。今年也一定很爲可觀哩。</p>
<p>什麼是車主需要的　一九三六年的新車大半都上市了。究竟車主們購買新車時他們所需要的是什麼呢。這倒也是一個饒有興趣的問題哩。據黑潑汽車公司銷售副經理赫爾勃氏研究的結果。車主在揀選一輛新車的時候。他所專注意的便是車子的式樣美觀。和它的動作走勢。凡是祇有看相而後有穩鉅的機力。或動作很好而體態不佳的。這都不爲買主所歡迎。關於動作一點。赫氏說並不是僅指着機力的增速或用高擋時爬山的便捷。此外還必須走動時非常平穩。避免一切震動。不但要使駕駛的人覺到輕便易御。就是座客們也必令獲得各種舒適之戚。所謂好的動作之中。又必須包括避震和安靜。像重心的低降。可使全車有安穗的保障。而允其使駕駛者在心理上覺得安適。關於這一點極關重要。因爲在長途的駕駛時。神經的不安閒最足令人疲的。</p>
<p>美國公路築造概况　美國因爲汽車事業的發達，她的公建築是非常發達的。據調査在去年八月三十一日止。全國中所築造和改建的公路。計的二八，〇〇〇哩。所費的金錢爲四五六，〇○〇，〇〇○元。其在築造中者還有六，三八六哩。計工費逾一四九，○四六，六三八元。此外五百五十九英重已經核准修築。工費爲一，五〇九，二〇一元。鋪石路工程頂偉大的其長度百一二，六〇一哩。估計工費價値爲美金九六，二九七，三四六元。做坡途和溝洫的工程。計七，〇四八英里。五八，九三六，六六九元。四，九○二英里的築路用水泥。價値一八七，八七八，九二五元。路基用瀝靑等費，三六九五英里爲三五，四六，七一三元。</p>
<p>飛行汽車的新發明　大家都知道汽車是着地而行的。可是現在美國有一個名呌華爾杜華德門的。他是加利福尼亞州的樂士安極立斯人。發明一種幾可陸行又能飛航的汽車。這車後有尾。用特造的翼來替代尾的作用。據一般人說。如果這種車眞能在街市間行走。那末在四路口遇到車輛交通擁擠的时候。就不上昇飛到空中。到也是件新奇的玩意兒呢。</p>
<p>汽車旅行繁榮市面　據美國汽車會的估計。去年美國人坐汽車出外旅行的。其數有三七，〇○○，〇〇○人。汽車共一一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。較之前年遊季增進百分之十五。這班遊客在各地所費的金錢。合計的有美金四，○〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。對於各地市面的繁榮有極好的帮助。又據各地的調査。去年遊客的增多，並不是限於一地的。差不多每一遊覽區或城市裏。多有相當的增加。像新英格蘭所增之數的近百分之十五。其他如西北太平洋岸各城。紐約·本雪文尼亞·西佛及尼亞等各遊覽</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Outlook on the Beginning of the Year</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zisheng</p>
<p>After the customary phrase "Happy New Year," one cannot help but think: will the future of this coming year be auspicious or inauspicious? Logically, in this process of increasing national crisis, apart from dreamers, one cannot be optimistic. However, it depends on human effort. No matter how bad the environment is, as long as the people of the country do not become decadent and work hard, it is not impossible to struggle to find a bright path. This is not just empty talk by reporters. There are examples of several emerging countries after the war that can be used as evidence!</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the first thing is China's national crisis. First, let us recall the past five years: since the "September 18th Incident" in the 20th year, one-tenth of our country's territory, the three northeastern provinces, has been militarily occupied by a strong neighbor; in the second year, there was the "January 28th Incident," and in addition to the trampling of part of the territory, sovereignty, and people, the national economic center was also about to be destroyed; in the third year, Jehol was lost, and the Tanggu Agreement was signed; in the fourth year, we were threatened by the "April 17th" statement, and national sovereignty was infringed upon; last year was the fifth year, and despite the economic cooperation, the North China Incident in the summer and the pseudo-autonomy movement in the winter were still unavoidable. Now it is the sixth year. Will the situation improve in this year, or will it get worse? The survival of China and the peace and chaos of the world are closely related to the answer to this question. Naturally, it is difficult to answer this question without grasping the two points: whether the strong neighbor can repent and whether China can rise again. Now, we can only look forward to it: if the three principles of Hirota towards China (proposed during the emergency of the North China situation in November) and the recent awakening of the Chinese people can be used as data for looking forward to the future, then the long year starting today will become the final struggle period for the strong neighbor to thoroughly resolve the China issue and for China to exert its ability to survive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 25th year of the Republic of China is 1936, which has long been a global sensation. Several years ago, those who discussed military affairs in the world predicted the human crisis in 1936 and speculated on the tragic situation of war. Now, the time has come. Looking at the situation: apart from the China issue, in Europe, the relationship between Britain and Italy is such that no one dares to determine that they will definitely not use force; regarding the struggle for colonies, the East African incident is continuing to unfold; in the Far East, the trend of confrontation between Japan and the Soviet Union has further advanced from the issue of the Middle East Road to the stage of competing for Outer Mongolia; in the Pacific, although the relationship between Japan and the United States has not yet reached a tense level on the surface, both sides are actively carrying out internal war preparations. Whether the prediction of a world war in 1936 will come true cannot be determined now; however, seeing the situation in the above aspects makes people shudder. Indeed, for us Chinese, no matter where the war starts, we will inevitably be affected and we will not be able to avoid the disaster of war. If China wants to coexist internationally, it must pay attention to dealing with this year. Political leaders have recently liked to talk about old morals, and reporters dare to borrow the Daoist's saying "establish a firm foothold" to make a contribution.</p>
<p>Looking at the domestic situation, it is relatively more encouraging. First, this will be the year to convene the National Assembly and end the period of political tutelage. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in the 16th year and completed the Northern Expedition in the 17th year, China has been in a period of party rule for nine years. In June of the 18th year, the Central Government passed the regulations on the period of political tutelage, clearly stipulating that the period of political tutelage would be six years and would be completed in the 24th year. During this period, although the Central Plenary Session discussed the National Assembly proposal in May of the 20th year, and the National Crisis Conference in the 21st year had a resolution to establish a public opinion organ (National Representative Conference) in advance, neither was realized. This time, after the resolution of the Fifth National Congress, it was decided to implement the convening of the National Assembly within the 25th year to announce the draft constitution. The First Plenary Session decided that the draft constitution would be announced in May of this year and the National Assembly would be convened on November 12th. This is not only a reason for those who have been advocating democracy for several years to be excited, but also for the people of the country to change their political psychology because they will have the opportunity to participate in political power. Therefore, this year, in terms of the convening of the National Assembly, will make the people of the country actively excited to prepare to participate in political power. Second, the resulting boost in public morale will make the national salvation movement effective. The reporter uses the recent student movement as the basis for the outlook: since the national crisis, the increase in foreign aggression and the excitement of public morale have not been proportional. Since the students in Peiping first launched a petition on December 9th, the whole country responded, and the atmosphere changed. Although the political authorities have the trouble of persuading and preventing students from all over the country from wanting to go to Beijing, they have always sympathized with the students' patriotic movement, and all the legitimate requests made by the students have been accepted, which is an unprecedented good phenomenon. On January 15th, student representatives will meet with political leaders to discuss national salvation plans. If the patriotic movement can maintain its spirit forever without exceeding the appropriate scope, then in the recent year, there will definitely be good results in the overall plan for national salvation, which cannot be ignored. Third, the political and economic trends. The sincere unity of the Chinese Kuomintang to jointly face the national crisis, which has been continuously sought since the Fourth Plenary Session in the 20th year, was seen at the Fifth National Congress as a good phenomenon of "regardless of north or south, near or far, all eliminating private views and jointly planning national affairs." The work of suppressing bandits has also continued to show results since the successful Fifth Great Encirclement and Suppression two years ago. If this can continue to develop along this path in the 25th year, then politics can be stabilized, and all construction undertakings will have the opportunity to proceed. The most difficult thing is the economic situation. In the face of the impact and pressure of the world trend, domestic rural areas are bankrupt, cities are depressed, and disasters continue, and the national crisis has not ended. In this environment, the Ministry of Finance's implementation of the currency management policy has failed to completely relieve the difficulties of commerce; the Economic Commission's efforts to carry out economic construction undertakings have been unable to take effect at present. Looking at this point, the reporter cannot help but feel that the year of the 25th year will still have an unavoidable relationship with the difficult and arduous lives of the people of the country.</p>
<p>The 25th year of the Republic of China is a year in which the Chinese people must work hard to struggle. The brightness of the future depends on the strength of the Chinese people's struggle!</p>
<h3>The Turn of Peace and War in Europe and America Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>When 1935 had just begun, it seemed that European and American countries could live in peace with each other. Although the League of Nations had long lost its soul; the Disarmament Conference had completely failed; the two dictatorships on the European continent were striving to rearm and expand their territories; and the two small countries in South America were engaged in incessant warfare. However, because the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary last year was resolved peacefully; the plebiscite in the Saar region on January 13 was satisfactory to all parties; and later, politicians of several major European powers used diplomatic means, held continuous meetings, and established many mutual peace agreements: everyone felt that at least temporarily, a period of stability could be maintained. Who knew that before the ink of these signed agreements was dry, most had already become waste paper? Some countries, for their own interests, disregarded the security of any group. So-called peace was only lip service, nothing more than a fantasy for innocent people.</p>
<p>What European countries were most worried about was the resurgence of Germany. Britain, France, Italy, and Russia all hoped to maintain the status quo of the Treaty of Versailles and did not like Germany rearming, which would threaten peace. However, what Germany had been thinking about for fifteen years was to break away from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles and restore its pre-war freedom. Seeing Germany's firm will, and feeling that perpetually restricting a nation and preventing it from rising was not a permanent solution, Britain and France, in early February, after consultations, agreed to abolish the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that limited German armaments. However, Germany had to participate in the complete European collective security plan, maintain the existing status quo, and abide by the actions of the League of Nations. Russia also expressed its support for this proposal; France and Italy had already agreed earlier. If Germany were not under the rule of Hitler, perhaps there would have been a possibility of compromise. However, the existence of a dictatorship relies entirely on a strong foreign policy; and Germany had long been making thorough preparations in a non-public manner. Therefore, while using extremely cautious language to reject the entire proposal, only allowing participation in an air defense agreement, Germany disregarded everything and announced on March 16 the restoration of compulsory military service and increased the standing army to thirty-six divisions, 500,000 men. This caused great panic in European countries. Britain was the first to protest, followed by France, Italy, and other countries. France further requested the League of Nations to discuss it, and the League formally condemned Germany. But the rice had already been cooked, and since the countries could not change the accomplished fact, they had to unite with each other and do some preventive work.</p>
<p>If Italy were not under the rule of Mussolini, perhaps this preventive work could have been quite successful. Because a young Eden from Britain and a seasoned Laval from France traveled all over Europe, wanting to unite a very large group to encircle Germany, so that even if Germany had very strong armaments, it could not break out of this encirclement. After Eden visited Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, the Stresa Conference followed. The political giants of Britain, France, and Italy attended: Britain was represented by Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon; France was represented by Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval; Italy was represented by Prime Minister Mussolini. As a result of the conference, Britain and Italy reaffirmed their responsibility to guarantee the Locarno Treaties; the three countries also opposed any unilateral abandonment of treaty actions; and if Austria's independence was in danger, they should immediately consult each other. In this way, European peace seemed to have been settled. As long as the countries could deal with Germany wholeheartedly, Germany might not seek trouble with other countries in the short term. Moreover, the Saar region people's vote, Germany won a great victory. Hitler then declared: Germany has recovered the Saar, from this point on there is no other territorial ambition. Who knew that among the countries preventing Germany, cracks soon appeared. Mussolini wanted to seize the small African country of Abyssinia, which fundamentally conflicted with the colonial policy of the British Empire, causing a great storm. All hope for collective peace had long vanished. Perhaps Germany was secretly laughing behind their backs at this time; and taking this opportunity, it could also step up its rearmament work. In case a second European great war breaks out, it would be perfect to create a significant force.</p>
<p>During this period, the two major countries of North America were not very concerned about the problems of European countries. They were only busy with their domestic "New Deal" issues. The United States was willing to stay out of all foreign disputes. Therefore, it tried its best to limit the business of arms dealers, so that those manufacturers specializing in making weapons of murder would have fewer opportunities to provoke war. Moreover, the US government's New Deal was repeatedly ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The government authorities were busy dealing with it and had no time to take care of matters that had nothing to do with US interests. However, the silver policy passed by Congress, which required the government to disregard the interests of other silver-using countries in the world and try its best to raise the price of silver, had a great impact and inevitably disrupted the world's finances. The country that suffered the most was China. By the end of the year, although the world price of silver had fallen, it remained a question whether silver advocates in Congress would again force the government to raise it when Congress reconvened this year.</p>
<p>The two South American countries, Bolivia and Paraguay, were still fighting to the death at first. Because Paraguay refused to accept the ceasefire conditions, the League of Nations lifted the arms embargo on Bolivia. Paraguay, in great anger, announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations on February 23, but later several South American countries, together with the United States, tried their best to mediate, and finally, a ceasefire was reached in mid-June. After all, outsiders cannot manage things in the Americas.</p>
<p>(II) The Beginning of War</p>
<p>Historically, many sacrifices of millions of people have been caused by personal ambition. Mussolini's ambition for Abyssinia is a prime example. Since the summer of last year, all that the world has heard and seen for more than half a year seems to be only the Italian-Abyssinian problem. No other news could arouse people's interest. The Italian-Abyssinian problem was certainly not sudden; there was a complex background. After the European War, Italy suffered a lot and knew that it had been fooled by Britain and France. Mussolini worked hard to turn a poverty-stricken Italy into a self-sufficient country. Britain and France did not allow him to develop in Africa, and he had long been resentful; he always wanted to create an opportunity to swallow the long-desired Abyssinia in one gulp. The conflict on the Walwal border last winter may have been a dispute deliberately created by Italy in order to have an excuse. Sure enough, a small matter turned into a big one, and today, it has become an irreversible situation.</p>
<p>Perhaps France and Italy had a tacit understanding in advance that Italy would help France in Europe to deal with Germany, and the exchange condition was that France would allow Italy to expand its colonial influence in Africa. Even Britain may have had some understanding at the time, so Mussolini dared to do it boldly. But he never expected that Britain and Germany would form an agreement. Although Hitler temporarily caught a cold, the Berlin talks were still held. By mid-June, Britain and Germany had established a naval agreement, and Britain had less to worry about. Therefore, it felt that allowing Italy to expand too much in East Africa might become a hidden danger in the future. But at that time, Italy had already mobilized on a large scale and continued to transport troops to East Africa; arbitration and negotiations also yielded no results. Mussolini certainly could not give up halfway, so the situation gradually changed, from the local Italian-Abyssinian problem to the worldwide peace problem.</p>
<p>France was in the most difficult position in this matter. On the one hand, it did not want to offend Italy, which would result in losing a good friend to deal with Germany; on the other hand, it had to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations. Although Abyssinia was a barbaric country in Africa, it was also a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, we see that since the Italian-Abyssinian problem expanded, France has tried every means to mediate. The three-nation conference outside the scope of the League of Nations, the five-nation committee within the scope of the League of Nations, and even the last failed British-French plan were all France's efforts to win over Britain and, within the possible scope, to satisfy Mussolini's desires. However, Mussolini's desires were insatiable, and the dignified League of Nations could not remain silent. It was only when the Italian army began to attack and bombed Adowa on October 3 that the League of Nations Executive Council passed a resolution on the 7th condemning Italy for violating the League of Nations Charter. Moreover, step by step, it imposed arms and economic sanctions on Italy. All members of the League of Nations, except Hungary and Austria, approved. Although Italy occupied Adowa in the initial military operations, washing away the disgrace of the 1896 defeat, it was actually making enemies of the whole world, which may not have been expected at the beginning. The League of Nations had previously been weak and helpless in the same situation; now it was suddenly able to straighten its spine and act like a tough guy. If it were not for Britain's own interests, firmly supporting the League of Nations, it would not have been so.</p>
<p>If the League of Nations' sanctions were limited to arms and economic aspects, it would not actually be able to make Italy submit in the short term. Modern motorized warfare cannot proceed without fuel. Italy's fuel supply relies entirely on other countries. Therefore, some people suggested implementing an oil embargo to control Italy's lifeline. After this proposal was put forward, Mussolini said: If the League of Nations formally passes an oil embargo, it would be equivalent to declaring war on Italy. Then Italy would rather fight than be sanctioned to death. Judging from the general trend, Italy may really take a risk when it is desperate. France is in a dilemma and must try to make a final mediation. Laval tried his best to persuade and indeed obtained the consent of British Foreign Secretary Hoare, agreeing to a so-called British-French peace plan, trying to force Abyssinia to sacrifice in order to avoid a European war. Who knew that justice was still in people's hearts, and as soon as this plan was announced, serious opposition arose within Britain and France. Even the cabinets of the two countries almost could not stand. After struggling to salvage the situation, Hoare's position as Foreign Secretary was sacrificed, and the entire plan was cancelled before the crisis was overcome. Now the oil embargo issue seems to be achievable by the League of Nations soon as long as the United States can cooperate.</p>
<p>Some people also say that even if the scope of sanctions is not expanded, Italy will not be able to support it. Abyssinia, which Mussolini despised, has shown admirable spirit and perseverance. When the military operation reached the second stage, although Italy had occupied a lot of land, Abyssinia gradually used local attacks, which made it difficult for Italy to cope. Of course, this is an overly optimistic speculation, but it is really enough for small and weak nations to hold their heads high with pride to have the heroic example of Abyssinia!</p>
<p>(III) Bleak Future</p>
<p>Now 1935 is coming to an end, and 1936 has already begun. Looking to the future, it is really worrying. The indirect impact will drag the whole world into the vortex. For prudent prevention, Britain has obtained guarantees from France and Mediterranean countries that if Italy attacks the British Mediterranean fleet, all countries will be willing to use military force to back Britain. At that time, will Germany stand idly by? Or will it lean towards Britain or Italy? This is the most painful question in France's mind. Will the United States, which controls the world's financial and raw material power, stay out of it? Or will it take the opportunity to profit? If American merchants, who generally only care about profit, disregard the government's neutral policy and still trade with warring countries, can the government shirk its responsibility? This is also why the League of Nations cannot immediately implement an oil embargo.</p>
<p>The start of the war is already imminent! The actions of various countries to expand their armaments are certainly becoming more and more active: you practice, I practice; you build ships, I build ships; the number of airplanes and cannons is constantly increasing; the period of compulsory military service is constantly extended. The trauma of the First European War is still in the memories of people in various countries, who can stop the bloodshed of the second war? Britain has a vast territory and is inevitably in danger of losing one thing while trying to gain another. Therefore, it is trying its best to win over the United States, wanting to unite the maritime forces with the relationship of the Anglo-Saxon race to resist the invasion of other countries. Many people in both countries support the conclusion of a practical agreement, thinking it is a force for stabilizing world peace. This combination is also very important for the Far East. However, it is not within the scope of this article, so even the ongoing London Naval Conference is omitted.</p>
<h3>Work Guidelines After the Beginning of the Year</h3>
<p>— Wu Dingchang</p>
<p>Various newspapers solicited articles for the New Year special issue from me. At this time when I am just beginning to take on actual administrative responsibilities, I do not have time to fully describe my thoughts due to public and private affairs. Therefore, I will briefly express my thoughts based on my feelings.</p>
<p>I have decided to head the Ministry of Industry and Commerce at this time. With the country in such a state, with so much to be done, I feel an even greater responsibility. "Governing does not require many words," one only needs to work hard. Moreover, the National Government's construction plan is a holistic deployment, and industrial construction is only a part of it. However, under the current circumstances in our country, due to various reasons, there are often some distances between planning and implementation. At the very least, the implementation cannot but be affected by the environment. Therefore, I do not want to say much about empty plans.</p>
<p>Our country's state-owned enterprises are few and far between and mostly failing. Private enterprises are becoming increasingly depressed and beset by crises. The people of the country, fearing the advent of economic bankruptcy, mistakenly believe that the administrative authorities should be fully responsible for running enterprises. In fact, this ministry is an industrial administrative agency, and not all kinds of enterprises need to be established by this ministry itself. The task of administrative agencies lies in providing effective guidance and promotion to state-owned and private enterprises through a systematic political structure. Therefore, I believe that horizontally, such as the National Economic Commission, the Construction Commission, and other agencies, although they have some similarities with this ministry in nature, the promotion of enterprises emphasizes division of labor and cooperation. This ministry should not hesitate to cooperate with or divide the tasks of various agencies with a spirit of clarifying responsibilities, avoiding duplication, and never arguing for rights and other useless disputes, so as to achieve the effect of different paths leading to the same goal. Vertically, such as the construction undertakings of various provincial governments, they should be facilitated and assisted in their success, and there should be no disputes between ministries and provinces. People's self-operated enterprises, large and small, should be relieved of their suffering, given protection, and assisted in their development. This ministry will never compete with the people for profit. This ministry should only be responsible for industrial administration and fulfill its responsibility for guidance and promotion. As for general basic work and the undertakings already undertaken by this ministry, such as the publication of the China Economic Yearbook and the industrial chronicles of various provinces, on the one hand, collecting various statistical data, and on the other hand, conducting on-site investigations in various provinces, this basic work is a prerequisite for all construction research and is valued by any modern country. Our country has a vast territory, and the communists have not been completely eliminated, so there are bound to be some difficulties, but we must strive to complete them, such as alcohol factories, paper mills, machine factories, ammonium sulfate plants, and industrial and agricultural experiment stations. Whether they are jointly operated by government and business, or state-owned, or have been completed, or are in progress, they should all be effectively implemented according to the original plan. Other new constructions should be advanced according to objective needs and the permission of subjective forces.</p>
<p>I come from the people, and I am confident that I still understand the hardships of the people. I deeply believe that the reason why our country's private enterprises cannot develop and the national capital cannot rise is that the impact of international factors is certainly serious, but there are also many internal reasons. We cannot say that with the power of the government in a short period of time, we can completely relieve the suffering of the people. But I deeply feel that administratively, if we can pay attention to this point at any time for private enterprises, the people will definitely benefit a lot, and the relationship between the government and the people will inevitably become closer, which is the opportunity for the development of private enterprises and national capital. Therefore, in the future, we must seek concrete realization of this matter. Now at the beginning of the year, I would like to briefly describe my humble intentions for starting work in the future as an offering.</p>
<h3>Our Responsibility to the Country</h3>
<p>— Lu Zuofu</p>
<p>The Chinese should clearly recognize their responsibility. It is not only because the country is in such a crisis that we should quickly save her, and that we can call it a day as long as we save her from destruction, as long as the forces oppressing us are slightly eased, we think we can avoid destruction. If we go back to save her every time she is in danger, we can keep saving her until she is completely destroyed. This is definitely not the way.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is definitely not to save the country from destruction, but to manage a country like a country—like a modern country, and even that is not enough. We should manage it to be even better than a good modern country. This kind of work is proactive and has no end. If we can truly manage this country with the largest population in the world better than other countries, who can destroy this largest and best country? We only need to be good enough not to destroy other countries, and we can turn this chaotic international situation into a different one. Isn't the effect more than just saving the country from destruction? It can even save the world! Conversely, if we cannot manage the country well for a long time, someone will always destroy us. Even if there is no A, there will be B, and there is no way to save it!</p>
<p>China should be managed into a successful modern country, or even better than a modern country. The responsibility does not only lie with the authorities; we should not only blame the authorities. If we all only know how to plan for ourselves, plan for our families, and plan for our related relatives, neighbors, and friends, why should we blame the authorities for planning for the country? The actions of people in a society always influence each other and generally do not stray too far. The authorities can only advocate planning for the country. Advocacy does not necessarily require the authorities. The result is that everyone in the entire country needs to plan for the country. Only then will any authorities have to plan for the country. Then there will be people to manage the country, and there will be people from the entire country to manage it. We must know that we do not have China in our minds, and we do not require that China be managed well, but the countries that oppress us have China in their minds, and they all want to manage China to suit their needs. We must also know that managing China well is absolutely necessary for the Chinese people. It is not only being responsible to the country, but also being responsible to the world in this very chaotic international situation with very close economic and cultural relations.</p>
<p>In this modern world, to manage the country well, and to enable everyone to manage the country well, we must put forward three slogans:</p>
<p>First, our knowledge must be as big as the world. We must find good countries and good methods in the whole world. We must know that backward countries are the most fortunate. If they really work hard, they can directly surpass all advanced countries. Because the methods and even all the tools we acquire are their latest inventions. The latest inventions are the most efficient. We will not go through all the failures they have experienced; we will not use all the things they are reluctant to abandon. We must seize this last opportunity, that is, we must find out all the failures in the world and the latest inventions, so our knowledge must be as big as the world.</p>
<p>Second, our problems must be as big as the Republic of China. Before today, we put ourselves or our families in front of everything, and they were planning for themselves or their families everywhere. After today, we should put the country in front of everything, and we must plan for the country everywhere. Whether we are in politics, education, or economic undertakings, our efforts are all based on the needs of the entire country, all to create movements for the entire country, and to make an impact on the entire country.</p>
<p>Third, our work only needs to be as big as what we are currently doing. Many people have the misconception that we can only help the country if we do things for the country. In fact, everyone, whether a farmer or a worker, whether a doctor or a teacher, as long as they are in the Republic of China, they are doing things for the Republic of China. As long as they truly work hard, they will also help the country from their own position, and they can also do many things outside of their profession to create an impact on the country. As long as we find problems from the Republic of China and find reliable ways to solve them from the world, we will have plenty of opportunities to solve problems.</p>
<p>Shen Bao's demand for progress is very obvious. In addition to the daily publication, they are now launching a weekly publication. We believe that their demands follow the progress of the entire world, promote the progress of the Republic of China, and promote the progress of everyone in their respective positions. We believe that they will be able to introduce world knowledge at any time, raise the problems of the Republic of China, and encourage everyone to work hard from their own positions to find ways to help the Republic of China solve problems.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Chinese Labor Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xuefan</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution began in England in the 18th century, machine industry, with its superior position, has dealt a fatal blow to handicraft industry. Consequently, handicraft workers had to abandon manual production and seek employment with employers. Employers, relying on machines, pocketed the profits of handicraft producers and, from each worker, extracted the rewards that should have been earned by their productive abilities, accumulating them on themselves. They became a class of people who reaped benefits without labor. The economist Angas said: "The owner of the means of production treats the results of the work of the means of production as his own production, while disregarding the labor of others. This contradiction is what gives the new production system its capitalist predatory nature and contains the seeds of today's social upheaval." This is enough to illustrate that after the success of the Industrial Revolution, capitalists used the capitalist system as a tool to directly extract the living resources of the working masses to irrigate the growth of capitalism. The more successful capitalism became, the more the laborers were exploited. As a result, a small number of capitalists possessed huge amounts of wealth, while the majority of the working class was plunged into starvation and cold. Therefore, the success of the Industrial Revolution, on the one hand, promoted the completion of capitalism, and on the other hand, it also promoted the class consciousness of the working masses. As a result, from the late 18th century onwards, employers and laborers in Europe and America were constantly in conflict, forming the opposition of labor and capital. Until now, this opposing situation has not been eliminated.</p>
<p>China is a country with backward production and fundamentally did not embark on capitalism. However, since the European War, machine production has gradually become active in major cities in the country. But the purpose of capitalism is to obtain profit, and there are two important conditions for obtaining profit: one is private property, and the other is free competition. Because property is private, it does not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the public to serve its own monopoly interests. Because it is free competition, as long as it has the ability, it does not care about the means or sympathy for humanity. It always uses its superior means of production to conquer everything. Therefore, they have regarded the exploitation of labor as an inevitable means of making profits: workers' wages must be extremely low, and workers' working hours must be increased as much as possible. They have forgotten that the structure of the social economy is the manifestation of the sum of production relations. In that case, although labor and capital are indispensable links in the structure of the social economy, there is a clear distinction between master and slave in the middle, and they have long been in an unequal position in production relations. Therefore, although China is a country with backward production, after the emergence of machine production, entrepreneurs, like those in Europe and America, are also moving towards the two paths of private property and free competition. The common goal is still capitalism. It fits the old Chinese saying: "All crows under the sky are equally black." Therefore, although China has not yet reached the completion of capitalism, it also has a "concrete and microcosmic" appearance. As a result, the emergence of the Chinese labor movement is also becoming active following the natural progress.</p>
<p>In the past, the government had not yet formulated labor laws, and the working hours of mechanical industry workers could be arbitrarily stipulated by the factory. According to the investigation at that time, in factories established by the state, workers worked at least nine hours a day, and as many as twelve hours; in factories established by capitalists, workers worked at least fourteen hours a day, and as many as sixteen hours. At the same time, their wages ranged from forty to eighty cents a day, and the lowest ranged from one and a half to three cents. Workers were spending impossibly high working hours but receiving impossibly low wages. As a result, our working masses naturally felt dissatisfied and indignant. In order to awaken the capitalists and seek a common life for mankind, they had to use strikes as a weapon. This kind of movement initially occurred in England, and later the European continent also adopted it. At that time, Chinese laborers also used it as a tool to resist the unreasonable exploitation and insults of capitalists towards laborers. This can also be said to be the beginning of the Chinese labor movement.</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to briefly talk about the past history of the strike movement. Because if we want to understand the history of the Chinese labor movement, the following events occupy the most important position. The most prominent of these is that in the eighth year of the Republic, the Shanghai Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill suffered too much loss due to wage issues, leading to a declaration of a strike. In the summer of the ninth year of the Republic, workers in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Hong Kong went on strike one after another due to soaring rice prices. As a result, either the capitalists opened a low-price grain store, or the capitalists increased wages, and the workers resumed work unanimously. On January 5, 1923, 20,000 workers on the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway organized a general labor union, and on February 1, they held an inaugural meeting. Because the authorities wantonly destroyed it, they telegraphed the whole country and issued a strike declaration, putting forward five demands. These few strikes can be regarded as a considerable victory for the workers, and the society also recognized the power of labor. In 1925, the most tragic and painful May Thirtieth Incident in the history of our labor movement occurred. As a result, Shanghai began a strike, market strike, and school strike. The number of strikers reached more than 156,000. Workers in various industries, as well as transportation workers in the concession, and even servants working in various foreign firms and other Western residences, also joined the strike. As the news from Shanghai spread, various places also responded one after another. Nanjing, Beijing, Jiujiang, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places all demonstrated against the imperialists. The breadth and duration of this worker movement were unprecedented.</p>

<h3>A Review of the Publishing Industry in 1935</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>The publishing industry is a barometer of a country's culture. When people want to investigate how "civilized and excellent" Germany has become since Hitler came to power, and how "barbaric and inferior" the Soviet Union really is, they often bring out a large number of figures from each country, saying that it is declining and that it is flourishing.</p>
<p>What about China's cultural undertakings? If we take a glimpse from the perspective of the publishing industry, and review the movements of the past year in the new year when everything needs to be brushed up, we may be able to get a superficial impression.</p>
<p>However, in countries with a capitalist system, the publishing industry, like other industries, is restricted by the net of commodities. Books are cultural products and also commodities. Thus, the movement of this cultural undertaking, which is regarded as sacred by some people, has to advance and retreat with the market situation.</p>
<p>This is the classification statistics of publications in the past year:</p>
<p>Looking at the total item in the table above, it is simply unbelievable that the efforts of the publishing industry in the past year only produced more than two thousand kinds of publications, and the total price, including large-scale ancient books, is only three or four thousand yuan. Although Hitler's Germany has tried its best to suppress public opinion, the statistical figures of publishing are falling year by year, but the number of publications is still more than 20,000.</p>
<p>The table above shows the new books published for the first time last year, excluding reprinted books, and also excluding textbooks. Large-scale ancient books are generally calculated according to the estimated price, the time limit is limited, the payment is in installments, and the books have hardcover and paperback editions. The prices are calculated according to the first installment of payment and the paperback price, which is the lowest price. However, this item of large-scale ancient books still accounts for 43.28% of the total. If the books published by the publishing industry are regarded as an investment by readers in cultural undertakings, then the focus of our publishing industry on absorbing idle funds is on reprinting ancient books. Since the Kaiming Bookstore used the excellent methods of modern printing technology to economically publish the Twenty-Five Histories, the classics of our country's history, large-scale reprinting of ancient books, crude and shoddy competition, and even bankruptcy and fraud, the public opinion circles have criticized, and insightful people have sighed. It really cannot but make us regret.</p>
<p>Literature and social sciences always account for a large number. Among them, social sciences include more categories, such as politics, diplomacy, education, and law, so the number seems to be huge. However, natural sciences and applied technologies seem to be too few in the total proportion in China, which is full of construction sounds. When it comes to the publications of these two subjects, if we look at it purely from a commercial point of view, popular natural science books sell well. Most of the publishers of specialized papers and reports are academic institutions. In terms of cultural value, this should be very high, but the publishers have no intention of popularizing the publications, and the experts of the authors mostly use classical Chinese, and even write directly in foreign languages. Experts do not have literary interests in their cultivation. At the same time, it is said that these specialized publications do not hope that ordinary people in China can read them, but are exchanged with foreign academic institutions after publication. Hou Debang, an engineer who won the first honor of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, wrote his famous book "The Alkali Industry" in English and published it in the United States. Except for the Bifa Foreign Firm in Shanghai, it is probably impossible to buy it elsewhere in China.</p>
<p>Magazines and publications followed the aftermath of the magazine year at the beginning of the twenty-fourth year. Under the slogan of the so-called "Second Magazine Year", they managed to struggle for a while, and finally declined with the twenty-fourth year. Miscellaneous publications were eliminated, and what remained were publications with academic and social value before the magazine year, and some were institutional publications with subsidies. This caused one of the three major publications of the humor school to collapse, and an owner who specialized in the magazine industry also changed to running a series of books, but in the end he was still "sick" and "retired."</p>
<p>It is said that last year was the "Year of the Small Newspaper", but we only saw a few small newspapers that were edited better than before.</p>
<p>Among the books published by Kaiming Bookstore last year, in addition to textbooks and large books, it also published 87 kinds of books, most of which were intermediate-level readings, which are classified as follows:</p>
<p>According to the table above, in addition to history and geography, natural science books accounted for the second largest percentage. Among general science books, at least the following ones are available for young people to read:</p>
<p>Astronomy in natural science has always been regarded as a science that has no direct relationship with life. In order to correct this wrong concept, the following books have been published:</p>
<p>In terms of language, several kinds of books have also been published specifically for the Chinese language of middle school students, accounting for a higher percentage. Among them, in addition to the book "Wenxin" which has been warmly welcomed by young people all over the country, the publication of "One Hundred and Eighty Lessons of Chinese Language" has opened up a brand-new path for the current Chinese language teaching in middle schools. And the "Youth English Series" has also given middle school students a lot of help in learning foreign languages.</p>
<h3>Kaiming Bookstore and New Literature</h3>
<p>— Oujia</p>
<p>When Kaiming Bookstore was first founded, it appeared as a posture specializing in the publication of new literary books. However, in recent years, as its business has gradually developed, its publishing scope has also gradually expanded. Recently, due to its efforts in publishing textbooks and supplementary reading materials for primary and secondary schools and large-scale works (such as the Educational Yearbook Dictionary, Thirteen Classics Index, Sixty Kinds of Songs, Twenty-Five Histories, and Twenty-Five Histories Supplements), people generally think that it has abandoned new literary books. In fact, this is not right. It is determined not to obliterate its past glory, and it will make renewed efforts in this area in the coming new year!</p>
<p>Look! Today is January 1st, and it is sending out three exquisite collections of essays for the first time. Mao Dun, Ye Shaojun, and Xia Ganzun are three masters of modern Chinese essays. We may as well quote the words of contemporary critics here.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Dafu said:</p>
<p>"Mao Dun... has experienced the world deeply, so he never forgets society when writing. His thorough observation and clear analysis are the most practical writing style in modern essays... If China wants to progress, if it wants to make articles related to real life, then the more essay writers like Mao Dun, the better." He also said:</p>
<p>"Ye Shaojun's style is rigorous, and his thoughts always grasp reality, so what he writes, whether it is a novel or an essay, makes people feel down-to-earth and never sloppy. Although he has not written many essays, his unique style is already present in the short texts: I think it is most appropriate for general high school students to take Mr. Ye Shaojun's works as a model for essays."</p>
<p>Mr. A Ying also said:</p>
<p>"In the activities of Chinese essays, besides Mao Dun and Lu Xun, there seems to be no third person who is working hard to explore this road." He also said:</p>
<p>"I would like to use the four words 'tranquility and detachment' to explain the characteristics of Ye Shaojun's essays. In terms of the content of the essay, it embodies the spirit of 'tranquility and detachment'. In terms of the form of expression, it also reflects a kind of 'light and elegant' style. The emotion is rich, but he expresses it in a very subtle way, as if a layer of light yarn is covering things, so light and so deeply touching. His words are light and agile, and so delicate and meticulous."</p>
<p>As for Mr. Xia Ganzun, because his articles have never been collected and published in a single volume, few people have criticized them. However, his delicate observation, sensitive thinking, and simple writing have always been well-known.</p>
<p>These three collections, although different in style and thought, also have a common feature, that is, they can be used as models for scholars. If junior and senior high school students want to learn some methods in terms of writing skills, then I will not hesitate to recommend these three books to them.</p>
<p>To get back to the point, these three books will be the vanguard of Kaiming Bookstore's new literary books this year. Novels by Ba Jin, Jin Yi, Shen Congwen, Mao Dun, and new works by other writers will also be presented to readers one by one!</p>
<h3>Making a Big Deal Out of a Small Matter</h3>
<p>— Mao Dun</p>
<p>——Preface to Sketches and Essays——</p>
<p>In the past, in Nishikyo, Japan, I wrote several essays because of "the whistle of selling tofu," "red leaves," "cherry blossoms," and so on. At that time, there was no so-called "Year of Essays" in the domestic literary world, and the saying of "spiritual nature" and "personal style" had not been loudly called for. I have never understood the subtle things of "spiritual nature," and I have always liked to express opinions, so although the articles such as "the whistle of selling tofu" were occasionally written, they are still full of "vulgar" opinions.</p>
<p>Later, for more than two years, I did not write any essays or the like. I did not write because other things took up my time.</p>
<p>After the "January 28th Incident," I often contributed to Ziyoutan. What Ziyoutan needed was short articles of five or six hundred words; however, Ziyoutan was ultimately "soft reading material" and was not suitable for didactic short articles. So what I wrote had to be like essays and like miscellaneous feelings—even sometimes it was simply like a review.</p>
<p>At the same time, after the resumption of publication of Dongfang Magazine, it also needed short articles such as essays because the "Literary and Art Column" was too narrow. The first article I started to contribute was titled "Our Literary World," which was completely an argument. However, a writer sometimes cannot help but accept "orders" from the outside like a manufacturer, so he has to manufacture according to the "orders," and the result is "Dark House," "Autumn Park," "Cemetery," and so on.</p>
<p>By July 1933, more than 40 articles had accumulated unconsciously; a bookstore asked me to give a manuscript, so I used these to fill the number, and randomly titled it "Mao Dun's Collection of Essays."</p>
<p>In the preface to this collection of essays, I have this passage:</p>
<p>"There has always been a saying of "making a small matter into a big deal," and now we often see articles that are close to "making a small matter into a big deal." However, I think the scenery of essays is the opposite, "making a big deal into a small matter."</p>
<p>"In this era, there are many "big topics." There are also some people who often "make a big deal into a small matter," saying that the sky-high things are commonplace, and everyone is told to put down a hundred and four hearts and quietly "wait for fifty years." My so-called "making a big deal into a small matter" is not this kind of practice.</p>
<p>"My meaning is: big topics are not allowed to be made big, so you can only make them small.</p>
<p>"And this word "make" is very difficult. Too sharp, of course, will not pass; too vague, it will be boring; too serious, it will become rigid; and too humorous, it is afraid that readers will think it is really a joke.</p>
<p>"So, based on my own experience, the process of producing an essay is that it is difficult to get a topic first, and it is difficult to do it just right second. Although I have been "forced" to write so many dozens of articles, every decision is a lot of sweat, and its lack of observation is self-evident.</p>
<p>"However, special times often produce special literary styles. And it is not that everyone is as useless as I am, and truly excellent "making a big deal into a small matter" essays have been produced a lot recently. Careful readers will naturally chew on them, and there is no need for me to say more here."</p>
<p>The above passage of mine was written in "July 1933; "the "Year of Essays" was still nowhere to be seen; the saying of "spiritual nature" was not yet seen in the market; I explained essays as "making a big deal into a small matter" articles, not for the sake of argument, but just following what I have always believed.</p>
<p>When there was already a "Year of Essays," and there was "spiritual nature," and there was the saying of "personal style," I still boldly wrote essays because of "need." During this period, I would also try to find the subtle thing of "spiritual nature," but unfortunately, "spiritual nature" was never willing to deal with me; but I also thought that there was "personal style," and it was probably inevitable, but this so-called "personal style" had nothing to do with "spiritual nature," but was formed and produced by each individual's environment and education; my essays were written and written and could not get rid of the tone of "vulgar" opinions, I am afraid it is an example!</p>
<p>By October 1934, the essays I wrote could actually be compiled into a book again; so I occupied a book in the Liangyou Literature Series under the name of "Chatterbox."</p>
<p>In fact, most of the things in "Collection of Essays" and "Chatterbox," although I call them essays, are not the usual essays but reviews of the body of miscellaneous feelings. In the first half of this year (1935), ... or the second half of 1934, when the "problem of essays" occurred in the literary world, several gentlemen pointed out that "the emergence and development of essays is because there is a special social need." This reminded me of what I said in the preface to the Collection of Essays: "Special times often produce special literary styles," and I was quite pleased that I did not say it wrong. But after writing the preface to the Collection of Essays, I felt more and more "useless" every day. I felt that the miscellaneous feelings I wrote were too much like hard-bitten short reviews.</p>
<p>Since Taibai was published, I planned... to borrow a sentence from Mr. Yu Dafu: "Use his strengths and abandon his weaknesses" (see Preface to the Second Collection of Essays in the New Literature Series). I planned to write the usual essays, as well as the sketches that were very popular at that time. I have written a lot unconsciously in the past year and published them in Taibai and Shenbao Monthly.</p>
<p>But even when "using" my "strengths," the results were still not good.</p>
<p>This is a selection of the essays I wrote (according to the usual meaning of the word)... or the first sorting.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Index of Personal Names in the Twenty-Five Histories</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xichen</p>
<p>The Twenty-Five Histories is the summation of historical records in our country. The personal names contained therein are as vast as the smoke and sea. Sometimes one person has different names and titles, sometimes two people have the same name across generations, and sometimes there are people with the same name at the same time but have nothing to do with each other. If there is no method of dividing and organizing, how can readers of history explore the ancients in the midst of the search for the redundant and vast, so as to use them as a resource for making friends with the past? The Qing people, with Hui Zuji's insight into this, then had the work of "History Surname Rhyme Compilation." As soon as the manuscript was completed, it was praised throughout the literary world. It is appropriate that it is praised in the world for manipulating torches to guide the pioneers. However, the book is limited to the Twenty-Four Histories, and does not include the names of emperors, empresses, and people in foreign biographies. The arrangement is also in the order of the times, and those with the same name across generations have no way to list them together to check their similarities and differences. The editing is based on the existing rhyme titles, which is quite inconvenient for checking today. The colleagues do not measure themselves, and when editing and printing the Twenty-Five Histories, they then initiated and set an example to make an index of personal names, so as to make up for this regret. Through mutual cooperation, without regard to the cold and heat, the strength of Mr. Lu Zhifen and Mr. Zhou Zhenfu is very great. When the book is completed, the origin of the book is recorded in this way. As for the editing and arrangement method and the traces of collecting omissions and supplements, it is like the general rules, and it will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>The Index of Personal Names in the Twenty-Five Histories was originally an appendix to the Twenty-Five Histories. The number of personal names collected exceeds 60,000, which is an increase of two-thirds compared with the History Surname Rhyme Compilation. Under each personal name, in addition to the total number of leaves in the Twenty-Five Histories, the volume number of each history is attached. It is extremely convenient for those who have the Twenty-Five Histories to check. Even those who have the Seventeen Histories, Twenty-Two Histories, or Twenty-Four Histories can easily check and obtain it. Mr. Lin Yutang once said: "I have long wanted to collect the biographies of various histories into a Biography of Famous People in China. Now that there is this index, buying one is equivalent to having the most complete dictionary of personal names." Mr. Wang Yunwu also said: "The Index of Personal Names in the Twenty-Five Histories is perfectly made. Especially with the volume number and the total number of pages of the book listed together, any version can be applied, and its benefits are great." Kaiming Bookstore has specially published it separately for the convenience of historians. The whole book has more than 500 pages, printed with Daolin paper, cloth and exquisitely made, priced at 3 yuan in legal currency, and a special price of 2 yuan before the end of January.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Abridged "Dream of the Red Chamber" (Excerpt)</h3>
<p>— Mao Dun</p>
<p>"I have always thought that if a master could extensively abridge the trivial stories in the Story of the Stone, leaving only the parts that skillfully depict human sentiments, it could be considered a representative work of modern Chinese literature." — Chen Duxiu</p>
<p>What was Cao Xueqin's intention in writing this Dream of the Red Chamber? The first chapter of Dream of the Red Chamber says, "The author himself says that after experiencing a dreamlike state, he concealed the true events and used the 'spiritual understanding' to tell the Story of the Stone. Hence, it is said 'Zhen Shiyin' and so on. But what events and people are recorded in the book? He himself also says: Now, I am busy with worldly affairs, accomplishing nothing. Suddenly, I think of the women of those days, examining them one by one, and I realize that their actions and insights are all above me. I, a dignified man, am truly inferior to those women. I am truly ashamed and regretful, but it is of no use. On this day, I want to compile a collection of the days when I relied on the blessings of heaven and the virtues of my ancestors, the days of wearing fine clothes and eating delicacies, the days of betraying my parents' teachings and failing to live up to the virtues of my teachers and friends, which led to my lack of skills and a wasted life, to let the world know that my sins are many, but there were real people in the inner chambers, and they must not be extinguished because of my unworthiness and self-protection... Although I am uneducated and without talent, what harm is there in using fictional language to elaborate on them? It can also make the women known and can also relieve the boredom of the time and awaken the eyes of my peers. Is it not appropriate? Hence, it is said 'Jia Yucun' and so on..."</p>
<p>Now that we know Cao Xueqin's background, we feel that this passage is clearly the author's "reason for writing the book." The events and people in the book are nothing but the author's life experiences. The surnames of the characters in the book are naturally "Jia" (fake), and they naturally allude to some real people, but these real people are nothing more than some women whom the author "personally saw and heard about for half his life." The "Jia Baoyu" in the book is clearly the author's incarnation; there is also a "Zhen Baoyu," who is also the author's hypothesis to remind readers. Dream of the Red Chamber is only a novel of an autobiographical nature!</p>
<p>Before Cao Xueqin, no one had written a novel of an autobiographical nature. Although Cao Xueqin bravely created it, he did not dare to clearly say that it was an autobiography; so in the first chapter, he vaguely entrusted the story to the empty-minded Taoist and the "stone." Because the meaning of his first chapter is vague, and China has never had a novel of an autobiographical nature, the people who studied Dream of the Red Chamber in the past always went to great lengths to think about it: some said that this book was a political novel with nationalistic and anti-Manchu thoughts; some said that Jia Baoyu was a shadow of Nalan Chengde, the son of Kangxi Dynasty's Prime Minister Mingzhu; some said that this book "was entirely written for Emperor Qing Shizu and Concubine Dong E." Here, we cannot elaborate, and readers can read Hu Shi's research on Dream of the Red Chamber for rebuttals of these theories.</p>
<p>But a novel of an autobiographical nature always has a central idea. What is the central idea of Dream of the Red Chamber? Although the author expressed a deep sense of repentance in the first chapter, the entire book is about the pain of involuntary marriage. The first eighty chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber (i.e., Cao Xueqin's original work) unfolds Jia Baoyu's "triangular love" on the one hand, and also writes about the pain of involuntary marriage on the other. However, Cao Xueqin still did not dare to clearly attack the traditional ethics of involuntary marriage, so he created the myth of "Spiritual Jade" and "Lingzhi Grass" to cover it up. Moreover, people like him who grew up in wealthy families would naturally escape to "fatalism" when they could not resist, and the so-called "marriage of wood and stone" is also a manifestation of his escape consciousness.</p>
<p>Before Dream of the Red Chamber, China had no novels of an autobiographical nature. This has already been said before. Water Margin is also a great masterpiece—in social significance, even greater than Dream of the Red Chamber; but Water Margin is a collection of many folk tales under the same theme, which "formed" after a long period of development of one or two hundred years. Strictly speaking, Water Margin is not a "personal work." Dream of the Red Chamber is different. It is a "personal work," the author's life experience, and a realistic work that a writer intentionally had. Therefore, from the perspective of the development of Chinese novels, Dream of the Red Chamber is the beginning of a new stage. Unfortunately, after Dream of the Red Chamber "came out" in the early Qianlong period, although the literati of the time were amazed by its novelty and copied it endlessly, and although many people continued to write it, no one followed the "spirit of realism" of Dream of the Red Chamber to describe the state of the world at that time. Therefore, the new stage in the history of Chinese novel development that Dream of the Red Chamber itself began unfortunately "ended with him."</p>
<p>Secondly, Dream of the Red Chamber is about "love between men and women." Before Dream of the Red Chamber, there were already many novels depicting love between men and women, but most of them regarded men as the main body and women as accessories; the description of women's graceful tenderness was nothing more than to set off the men's "fortunate romantic experiences." Dream of the Red Chamber also initiated the depiction of women as independent individuals. The difference between Jia Baoyu and the protagonists of many "talented scholars and beautiful ladies novels" is that Jia Baoyu is not some "romantic master" or "flower protector," but a pitiful person who is also oppressed by the old traditional ethics. The women in Dream of the Red Chamber are all living people, objective characters observed by the author, not the "beauties" imagined by the authors in other "talented scholars and beautiful ladies" novels. This point is also the "new stage" that Cao Xueqin began, but later people were unable to continue to develop it.</p>
<p>Again, the "techniques" of Dream of the Red Chamber were also not well promoted by later people. Dream of the Red Chamber writes about the personality of "characters," avoiding introductory narratives and expressing a living Lin Daiyu from trivial actions. The reader's impression of Daiyu's appearance and personality is gradually gathered with the development of the story in the book until a complete Daiyu takes root in the mind, as if they have known each other all along. Several important characters in Dream of the Red Chamber are written in this way. The character descriptions in Water Margin are also excellent, and this writing method is also used; but the personality of the characters in Water Margin has already been fully developed in the description of several consecutive "chapters," and after that, when this character reappears, it is "fixed" and cannot be added to. For example, Wu Song, such as Lu Da, in the chapters specifically written about them, they are alive, but in the chapter where Wu Song and Lu Da are combined, these two people are not exciting. Therefore, Water Margin writes about the personality of one hundred and eight people (in fact, it does not write about thirty-odd), and it writes about one and then writes about another, so when these characters who have already been written reappear later, they are stiff and unexciting. Dream of the Red Chamber is not like that. Many characters in Dream of the Red Chamber develop with the development of the story. Even though Wang Xifeng has been written a lot in the front, and you think you already know this spicy sister Feng, you still love to read the places where Sister Feng is involved in the later stories, and you still feel that this Sister Feng is always alive.</p>
<p>Dream of the Red Chamber is not contrived. The whole book only writes about the affairs of food, drink, men and women, and there are no shocking events, but books of the same kind often contrive many "amazing pens" to stimulate the reader's emotions, but the result is disgusting. Dream of the Red Chamber does not flaunt such small tricks. The end of each chapter is just a plain closing, and there is no "stuffy gourd" left to entice readers to read the next chapter. But readers always want to read on and cannot stop. There is no neat "structure" in each chapter of Dream of the Red Chamber. It is just a series of trivial things about food, drink, men and women, but the more trivial and fragmented, the deeper our impression is, as if we are in the trivial and chaotic life of the Jia family. A "neat structure" is naturally good, but a "neat structure" that is hard-made often makes people feel unnatural after reading it, and feel that they are "reading a novel" and that it is "not real."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Duxiu once said: "I have always thought that if a master could extensively abridge the trivial stories in the Story of the Stone, leaving only the parts that skillfully depict human sentiments, it could be considered a representative work of modern Chinese literature" (see Chen's preface to the YAdong edition of Dream of the Red Chamber). How dare I presumptuously call myself a "master," but I am interested in Mr. Chen's proposal, and I cannot help but be bold and offend Dream of the Red Chamber once.</p>
<p>In total, about two-fifths of the entire book has been abridged. Since it has been abridged, the chapter divisions cannot follow the original, so I made another bold decision, reordered the chapters, and renamed the "chapter titles."</p>
<p>People who study Dream of the Red Chamber can read the original book. But if middle school students want to learn some literary techniques from Dream of the Red Chamber, then this abridged version, although not perfect, may still be of some use.</p>

<p>It is particularly noteworthy that the object of this workers' strike was by no means a dispute over their own class interests, but their goal was to overthrow imperialism. It was a complete manifestation of national spirit, which is not only a glorious page in the history of the Chinese labor movement, but also the most valuable event in the history of the Chinese national movement. Later, the National Revolutionary Army launched a major Northern Expedition, and the army decided to take Hangzhou. All the workers in Shanghai immediately launched a general strike, with the number of strikers reaching more than 500,000, which posed a major threat to the rear of the Allied forces. The Allied forces knew where the public opinion lay, and already felt defeated and exhausted! The National Revolutionary Army was able to complete the mission of the Northern Expedition because of the assistance from the side. This strike had a great impact on politics, and in the history of the labor movement, it can be compared with the May 30th case, shining before and after. Recalling the several strikes sixteen years ago, the labor movement clearly showed a change in ideology. The early strikes were almost entirely for the class interests of the workers themselves, but later, in addition to fighting for class interests, the labor movement further fought for the interests of the nation and the country. This general history of past struggles is enough to comfort our labor itself.</p>
<p>By the time the Revolutionary Army established its capital in Nanjing, the Chinese labor movement can be said to have completely completed its early mission. Labor has gained a considerable position in society, and has also made considerable contributions to the history of the national struggle. However, after the major changes in the world economy in 1929, all countries were affected by the depression and used military, political, and economic forces to attack our country. The Chinese business community was also in a very difficult position. In the past two years, this situation has become even more intensified. Rural areas are bankrupt, factories are closed, and the unemployed are everywhere. Floods and droughts are coming one after another. Shanghai is the center of China's economy and the base camp of the working class. Now workers everywhere feel the pain of unemployment. Taking the first six months of last year as an example, the number of unemployed workers in Shanghai increased to more than 127,000. A table is attached on the left:</p>
<p>Statistical Table of the Increase in Unemployed Workers in Shanghai (Republic of China, 24th year)</p>
<p>According to the reasons for worker unemployment listed in the above table, they are all due to factory shutdowns and wage reductions. This shows the situation faced by Shanghai manufacturers. If the labor movement still wants to take a confrontational stance to deal with the remaining dying national industry, wouldn't this be creating opportunities for imperialism? At the same time, manufacturers should also not take the opportunity to close down, so as to subject the business community to an unprecedented catastrophe and encounter unnecessary sacrifices. Fortunately, the labor and management classes in Shanghai can all maintain a spirit of cooperation, endure each other, and overcome this difficulty; therefore, we not only do not want our respected workers to act rashly and cause trouble for themselves, but at the same time, we will not relax our protection of the workers. We hope that our labor movement can obtain practical benefits for the workers. In addition, I believe that for labor welfare undertakings, such as labor insurance, labor education, labor hygiene, and labor consumer cooperation, I am also willing to work with comrades who are enthusiastic about the labor movement. And therefore, uniting labor and uniting to fight is indeed the current task of our labor. At the same time, it is hoped that the Chinese labor movement can establish a relationship with the world labor movement; only the practical cooperation of the working class in the world can lay the foundation for true world peace. We want to introduce the vast majority of China's poor laborers in the world to the labor movements of various countries in order to seek the common welfare of world labor.</p>
<p>In short, the early movement of Chinese labor has come to an end. In the future, we should further exert the instinct of the working class and seek true benefits; we must not forget to do a greater movement to revitalize the nation. Only our working class is most able to shoulder this mission. To remove the obstacles to national freedom and equality, only by working hard in the labor movement can we achieve results. Our working class, in times of national peace, stands at the forefront of national industry to fight against capitalists. And as the vanguard of developing the national economy. Once it is a time of national emergency, we stand at the forefront of national self-determination to fight against imperialists and be the masses of people to revitalize the nation. For the sake of justice, for the sake of national freedom and equality, for the sake of the future of the nation, and even more for the sake of human peace, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices, we will not refuse any difficulties, we will always work hard and always struggle! Always moving forward!</p>
<h3>A Review of the World and Chinese Economy in 1935</h3>
<p>— Mu Ouchu</p>
<p>In ancient times, Grand Historian Sima Qian compiled the "Records of the Grand Historian," extensively gathering forgotten tales of agriculture, industry, commerce, merchants, politics, wealth, and the great origins of human fortunes and disasters during the Spring and Autumn, Warring States, Qin, and Han periods. He compiled these into "Biographies of the Money-Makers." I have always considered this a groundbreaking achievement. This alone is enough to make Sima Qian immortal. He possessed a unique insight into the governance, chaos, rise, and fall of society and human groups, refraining from empty rhetoric to arbitrarily praise or criticize. His words were:</p>
<p>"...Therefore, people rely on farmers for food, hunters for resources, artisans for manufactured goods, and merchants for circulation. Is this not where the subtleties of governance and education lie? People each apply their skills and exert their strength to obtain what they desire. Thus, when goods are cheap, it signals rising prices; when they are expensive, it hints at falling prices. Each encourages their trade and enjoys their work, like water flowing downwards, ceaselessly day and night. Without summons, they come on their own; without seeking, the people produce them. Is this not in accordance with the Dao and a validation of nature?"</p>
<p>From this, it follows that the people's "songs, customs, clothing, food, livelihood, funeral, and death provisions" must rely on the efforts of farmers, hunters, artisans, and merchants to provide them. One cannot rely on their own strength alone. Agriculture, hunting, industry, and commerce are economic affairs. Price fluctuations are subtle and rapid, occurring day and night, and cannot be reversed or hindered by human effort. These phenomena not only fall outside the scope of Laozi's so-called "utopia where neighboring countries are within sight of each other, the sounds of chickens and dogs are within earshot, and the people are content with their food, beautiful in their clothes, secure in their customs, joyful in their work, and never interact with each other until they die of old age," but also align with the Dao and are validated by nature. Since people each apply their skills and exert their strength to obtain what they desire, they progress from near to far, from simple to complex, from basic to refined, like water flowing downwards. Therefore, the utopia of never interacting until death is ultimately unattainable. Today, with trains, ships, airplanes connecting the five continents like courtyards and linking all nations into one room, people's desires are multiplied a hundredfold compared to the past, and their application of skills and exertion of strength to achieve them are also multiplied a hundredfold. Consequently, competitions for surplus and deficits, and struggles for profit and loss, arise in increasing complexity, evolving into contention and escalating into warfare, the severity of which has reached its peak today! Now, our nation's power is declining, barbarian horses are running rampant, giants are inactive, and dwarves are leaping about. Reflecting on the past to contemplate the future, the prospects for China and the world in 1936 will be divined from the events of China and the world in 1935, and the crux of the matter undoubtedly lies in the economy. I will analyze and synthesize the major economic changes both domestically and abroad this year, extracting the essential points and interweaving them with my own interpretations, presenting them to the nation as a humble contribution for the New Year. Will you permit me?</p>
<p>Of course, there are fifty or sixty countries in the world, and China is but one of them. China's interactions with these other fifty or sixty countries are frequent, and the relationships are increasingly close. China's reforms, benefits, and harms cannot be found solely within China; they must be sought in the intertwined relationships of other nations. For example, in Shanghai, the rise and fall of silver prices and the expansion and contraction of finance originate in London or New York. The urgency of one nation is linked to the prosperity or decline of another, as the saying goes, "When the copper mountain collapses in the west, the bronze bell echoes in the east." Therefore, discussing the Chinese economy today requires prioritizing the world economy. Briefly, there are several key points:</p>
<p>For over a hundred years, the world's major industrial powers have competed to colonize as a shared and ingenious strategy for profit. They have attacked cities, seized territories, and filled the fields with corpses. Weaker nations are suppressed as protectorates, and the weakest are turned into colonies. Recently, economic anxieties and tariff barriers have been erected ever higher. The world's leading powers each use their protectorates and colonies as necessary scopes to maintain their trade, building their own fences and forming their own systems to compete with the equal powers of other major nations. This is what the world calls a "bloc economy." Britain uses the gold pound to control its imperial colonies and affiliated states, so those within this sphere of influence are called the "Sterling Bloc." France, with the richest gold reserves in Europe, uses its financial power to control the small countries of Eastern Europe, so those within this sphere of influence are called the "Gold Bloc." The United States uses the gold dollar to dominate Latin America, and recently has extended its reach to Australia and Canada, gradually taking over the power of the British Empire. Those within this sphere of influence are called the "Dollar Bloc." On the western shore of the Pacific Ocean, there is a powerful nation called Japan, with soaring ambitions and a hunter's joy. It also imitates Britain and the United States in intensifying the creation of a Japanese imperial economic bloc, using Korea, Taiwan, and what it calls "Manchukuo" as its satellites, especially coveting the entirety of China. Therefore, it spares no effort to manipulate, plunder, and nibble away at it, "day and night without rest." This is what the Tokyo government dreams of. Italy, located in the Mediterranean, strives to operate its business. It launched a distant and laborious attack, desiring to reduce Abyssinia to a protectorate, with the same goal and ambition. What, then, are the consequences of the bloc economy? I say that the bloc economy is the result of mergers and acquisitions, and in itself is a factor in future mergers, acquisitions, and great wars. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The beauty of the East, holding much gold but with no place to spend it, like a woman with a stagnant internal flow, experiences a resurgence of energy. Therefore, gold dollars are everywhere, dog meat smells worse than vermilion doors, and the granaries are full of rich foods while the roads are filled with starving corpses. The inequality of human affairs could not be greater, so unrest arises in all directions, and grievances grow. President Roosevelt wants to remedy this, so he implements social policies, one to prevent overproduction, and the other to have the wealthy practice some frugality to help the extremely poor. His intention is to maintain the modern industrial system from collapsing. The poor have not tasted the benefits, while the rich are greatly inconvenienced. Beset by opposition on all sides, President Roosevelt, despite exerting his remaining strength and struggling in every way, ultimately fails, and the once sensational Blue Eagle movement must "pass away peacefully" at this time. Alas, the Americans, skilled in commerce, patch and mend and create grand illusions like this, and their efforts are so laborious and yet so fruitless! This is the second point.</p>
<p>The competition between Britain, Japan, and the United States for China is becoming increasingly fierce. The United States uses the "Open Door Policy" as a spear to restrain Japan's monopoly, while Japan uses "Pan-Asianism" and "China's Self-Reliance" as shields to exclude the United States and other powers. Britain hesitates between Japan and the United States, watching both sides and considering maintaining its own interests as the best strategy. Judging by the amount of investment in the three countries, Britain is first, Japan is last, and the United States is second; however, judging by the rate of increase in investment in China by the three countries, the United States is first, Japan is last, and Britain is second. The economic conflict between the United States and Japan in China is so sudden because of this. Britain, unwilling to let Japan exclusively possess China and powerless to restrain it, with the Eastern African situation affecting the immediate interests of the empire, views the Far East as even more important. It is proper that it must use all its strength to maneuver. Japan seizes this opportunity of a lifetime to intensify its aggression against China, euphemistically calling it "economic cooperation." This is the third point.</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet Union's unique economic prosperity, rising as a dark horse, makes the industrial powers of the old world, especially Japan, uneasy. The outbreak of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union has recently become increasingly imminent. Germany, though skilled in manufacturing, faces difficulties in trade and is economically impoverished. The people's livelihood is declining, which is already unbearable. Added to this is the restoration of military parity, with excessive levies and no respite. National strength is exhausted, so it must seek to extend its influence among the world's weak nations. If it cannot obtain what it desires, it will seize it from the hands of another strong enemy. France is consequently on edge, not even having time to sleep. The contradictions at the London Naval Conference are numerous, and those in the know have long predicted its failure. These are all the alarm signals frequently transmitted in the drumbeats of December 1935.</p>
<p>Looking back at China, I cannot help but feel a chill! However, in recent years, there have been considerable construction projects, such as the expansion of aviation, the construction of highways, the increasing construction of railways, and the transformation of cities. However, "the sunset is infinitely beautiful, but it is only near dusk." These constructions, speaking in normal terms, are all necessary plans; however, in this time of unresolved internal troubles and increasingly urgent external crises, relying solely on this kind of step-by-step policy is far from sufficient for planning for survival. If a strong neighbor is pressing upon us and we do not have extraordinary strength to respond to it, it will be impossible to even seek temporary peace in a corner. If you do not believe me, please consider the following matters:</p>
<p>What our country, from the government to the people, is competing to boast about is that China has been an agricultural nation since ancient times. We will wholeheartedly revitalize agriculture, first making the country self-sufficient, at least in natural products, not relying on foreign sources. Then we will join forces to revitalize industry and advance, following in the footsteps of the great powers, so that the foundation will be secure and the goal will be easily reached. However, recent events prove that this is not the case. Are rice and wheat not the most important agricultural products? Yet our country must rely on foreign supplies for both rice and wheat. This year, "in the first half of the year, the total amount of foreign rice imported into the country reached more than 11 million metric tons, worth more than 75 million yuan in national currency," and "wheat imports are also considerable." In the first half of the year, the value of imported foreign wheat was customs gold 16,783,029 yuan (equivalent to 29,428,110 yuan in national currency). The value of other grains imported from abroad this year reached 111,166,759 yuan in national currency, adding to the two items of rice and wheat, totaling more than 200 million yuan. We do not yet know the amount of grain imports in the second half of the year, but considering the famine situation in China, the amount should also be considerable, at least on par with the first half of the year. If so, then the food imported from abroad this year will be no less than 500 million yuan. What, then, is the meaning of the so-called "establishing the country on agriculture" and "revitalizing agriculture"?</p>
<p>Furthermore, is cotton not the largest product produced in our country besides food grains? According to estimates by the Cotton Production Statistics Association: "This year's cotton production area is 35,485,816 mu, with a lint cotton production of 8,391,018 dan, and a wasteland area of 12,291,300 mu. Last year's cotton production area was 44,971,264 mu, with a lint cotton production of 11,201,96 dan. This year's cotton field wasteland is nearly one-third, and cotton production has also decreased by one-quarter or more." This is mostly due to natural disasters; however, the frequent occurrence of natural disasters is also due to human negligence. What, then, is the meaning of the so-called "establishing the country on agriculture" and "revitalizing agriculture"?</p>
<p>According to the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association's announcement: the total cotton fields in Chinese provinces are 35,485,818 mu, and the cotton fields in Hebei are 6,315,970 mu, which is the highest among all provinces except Jiangsu, and its production is also greater than that of Jiangsu. Now it has entered the economic scope of the Japanese, with a tendency for the guest to usurp the role of the host. What, then, is the meaning of the so-called "establishing the country on agriculture" and "revitalizing industry"?</p>
<p>Let us also speak of industry. The main force of our country's industry is the yarn industry, and we have heard about the situation of the yarn industry this year. A reporter for the Yishi Daily said: "We have tallied up the yarn factories in our country that have stopped work and are being liquidated this year. Including the recent Shenxin Nos. 1 and 8 factories, there are 18 in total... The total number of Chinese factories in the country is only 92, but now 18 factories have closed and stopped work in seven months, accounting for nearly one-third of the total. The total number of spindles in Chinese factories in the country is 2,742,754, but now 814,076 spindles have been stopped in seven months, accounting for nearly one-third. The total number of thread spindles in the country is 1,430,042, and 34,476 spindles have been stopped in seven months, accounting for about one-quarter. The total number of looms in the country is only 20,926, and 6,817 looms have been stopped in seven months, accounting for more than one-third. The total number of textile workers in the country is 156,224, and 42,948 people have lost their jobs in seven months... If this continues, will our country's textile industry not be almost completely bankrupt within two years? Is the future of our country's national industry still worth asking about?" Furthermore, the yarn industry in the second half of this year has not yet been settled, but judging from the situation in the financial community, it will undoubtedly be worse than before. What, then, is the meaning of the so-called "self-sufficiency"? What way will it be achieved?</p>
<p>Or, some will say, "Revitalizing industry requires transportation first, so in recent years, the construction of highways can be said to have spared no effort. By the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the total length of passable lines in the country was 111,000 kilometers, more than double the number in the 19th year of the Republic of China, and the Sichuan-Hunan-Guizhou highways and the provincial and county highways have mostly been completed one after another this year. Within one or two years, our country's highway network will surely be completed. After completion, unification can be expected, because the convenience of military transportation, the communication of the economy, and the dissemination of culture all rely on the power of highways. Therefore, it is not too much to criticize hard work." I respond by saying: "Yes and no. Although the current highways are convenient for military transportation, they are not yet for communicating the economy and disseminating culture. Not only have the people not seen the benefits, but they have actually suffered the harm first. Whenever a highway reaches a certain place, foreign economic forces enter that place. The so-called cars and gasoline are like leaky containers, and the amount increases year by year, and the goods of Europe, America, Japan, and England also follow like mercury seeping into the ground, without any gaps. Furthermore, there are costs for building roads and costs for maintaining roads, all of which are taken from the hard-working people, and farmers are not allowed to use highways (such as ox carts, horse carts, etc.) for transportation. What, then, is the meaning of the so-called 'self-sufficiency'? What way will it be achieved?" In short, the state's administration itself has no way to stand on its own feet, and financial panic follows the bankruptcy of the rural areas in the interior and the decline of industry. Externally, the United States buys silver, and cash flows out, and the credit system is gradually becoming bankrupt. Although the government resolutely implements a currency control policy, hoping to save the situation, the Tokyo government opposes it first, denouncing it as a British conspiracy. The United States government initially suspects it, and then lowers silver prices. China's foreign exchange rate is unable to maintain its balance. Those who are familiar with the situation have long known that it is impossible for a weak country to compete with the great powers for a day in the economic scope alone! As for high prices and the stagnation of all industries, that is another matter.</p>
<p>I once quoted the immortal words of the Grand Historian, and I feel that today we still cannot but seek the way of "relying on farmers for food, hunters for resources, artisans for manufactured goods, and merchants for circulation." For when material resources are sufficient and the people's strength is sufficient, then we can compete in the changing world. If we consider the current economic situation of China, most of the rice, wheat, cotton, and iron come from foreign countries, and the industrial and commercial economy is troubled by decline. If the world has an extraordinary event, China will reach the final stage, and it will not be impossible for it to collapse, be captured, and await death, and the future of the Chinese nation is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Because of the severity of the economic panic, all countries in the world are increasingly eager to exploit the economies and invade the lands of small and weak nations. Given China's such deep relationship with the countries, the Chinese nation must make the greatest determination. However, the problem of the survival of the country and the nation cannot be solved solely by the efforts of the government. We, the people, must rise up together and provide strong support for the government to resist foreign insults and respond to extraordinary events. The restoration of the rural economy and the cultivation of industrial and commercial production are the foundations of the nation. At a time when foreign insults are increasingly urgent and the national economy is in panic, we must first cultivate the vitality in advance to build a self-sufficient "national economy." We certainly know that under the pressure of strong neighbors, we are not allowed to engage in buried construction work, and the shrinking of land will further cause serious losses to the national economy. Therefore, we must unite and work hard together. On the one hand, the government should vigorously engage in the construction of the rural economy and vigorously maintain the revival of industry and commerce; on the other hand, it should weigh the international situation and domestic resources, and strive for the integrity of the country's territory and the independence of its sovereignty. We, the people, read President Chiang Kai-shek's words at the Fifth National Congress, and we cannot help but express our sympathy to him!</p>
<h3>The Beginning of the Era</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yu Zhe</p>
<p>As the sounds of the year-end drums fade, the new year dawns. Seeing this fragmented nation, when will it be whole again? One can't help but lament the fleeting nature of time. People of old often compared time to flowing water, describing its swiftness and the impossibility of its return. Hence, the sayings, "Time does not stay, seasons flow by," and "Beautiful faces like flowers, years like flowing water." But is this analogy truly correct? What is it that never returns? Is it time, or is it we ourselves? I believe this remains a question. We often hear the lines: "The Yangtze River's back waves drive the front waves, in the world, new people replace the old." Lu Ji's "Rhapsody on Lamenting Time" says, "The river passes water to become a river, the water flows on day by day. The world passes people to become the world, people slowly approach their end. What generation is not new, what person can remain old?" This clearly sees through that the people of the world are like the surging river. As for time itself, it remains there eternally, never stirring. In the end, who is still and who is moving is merely a matter of perspective. Liezi rides the wind, unable to distinguish whether the wind carries him or he carries the wind. Zhuangzi's butterfly dream also doesn't know whether he dreamed of being a butterfly or the butterfly dreamed of being him. Here, we only discuss science and not philosophy. These profound and mysterious arguments can be temporarily set aside. However, the fact that the old year has abandoned me and the new year comes to entwine my heart is a very clear reality before us. Time is inherently invisible and intangible. Now, who is it that forcibly divides it into segments of years, months, days, and hours? Who is it that causes this? As the cycle of heaven and stars revolves, and a new beginning commences, everyone may still be somewhat interested in this question.</p>
<p>Our current way of life, viewed through the eyes of Chen Zhongzi, who refused to eat what others hadn't tilled, or Liang Hong, who did not seek warmth from others, would certainly be difficult to consider satisfactory. The reason we know that yesterday was New Year's Eve and today is New Year's Day is entirely dependent on the reports from the calendar on our desks. Because it is too easy to know when a year begins and ends, we instead neglect the meaning of the year. But, "In the mountains, there is no calendar, one knows the year by the cold and heat." Precisely because the mountain people have no calendar to consult, they truly know the meaning of the year, which is closely related to cold and heat. However, cold and heat each have a very long duration. We cannot specify how many days there are between cold and cold, or between heat and heat. In other words, the phenomenon related to cold and heat can be utilized. The most scientific method is none other than erecting a pole and observing its shadow. At noon, the pole's shadow is shortest in summer and longest in winter. From the shortest shadow to the shortest, or the longest to the longest, the period of time elapsed is exactly equal to one year. In ancient times, our country's Shao Hao Jin Tian clan used birds to record official positions. Because swallows come at the spring equinox and leave at the autumn equinox, the official in charge of the equinoxes was called the Yi Bird Official. Because cuckoos sing at the summer solstice and stop at the winter solstice, the official in charge of the solstices was called the Bo Zhao Official. The dates of the equinoxes and solstices were all determined by the method of erecting a pole and observing its shadow. Four thousand years ago, there were already special officials in charge of this duty. It is no wonder that our country's calendar developed so early.</p>
<p>It is said that in ancient Egypt, the method of determining the length of a year was different again. Every time the Nile River was about to flood, they would see the Sirius star and the sun rising almost simultaneously in the early morning. They took this phenomenon as the standard for the year, and from this determined that the time contained in a year was three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days. However, the year determined by this method does not completely coincide with the year of cold and heat seasons. Although the difference between these two types of years is not obvious in a short period of time, after many years, in Shao Hao's equinox and solstice year, the timing of cold and heat is fixed. But in Egypt's year based on the simultaneous rising of the sun and Sirius, the timing of cold and heat will gradually advance. Then, although the beginning of the year, the New Year's Day, may be accompanied by rain and snow before our eyes, the New Year's Day five thousand years later will see willows swaying. The New Year's Day ten thousand years later could be marked by scorching suns and melting stones. Would the meaning of the year not then disappear completely?</p>
<p>Although Julius Caesar expanded the territory of the Roman Empire and his great talent and strategy were unparalleled, he was inevitably influenced by Egypt, the country he conquered, in terms of culture. When he reformed the calendar in 45 BC, he copied the Egyptian year of three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days wholesale. The only original part of it was perhaps the addition of his own name to July (July). From Caesar's perspective, this was a wonderful way to leave his name to posterity, like sinking a stele in the Han River and erecting a monument on Yan Mountain. However, those who succeeded Caesar and ascended the Roman throne could not help but be envious. Therefore, Emperor Augustus also renamed August (August) after himself. But August originally only had thirty days. Compared to Caesar's July, this inevitably seemed inferior. So he came up with a way to take one day from February and add it to his own August. Poor February, already with few days, was left with only twenty-eight days after this exploitation. And July and August were both thirty-one days in a row.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of this calendar were bound to appear eventually. When Caesar implemented the calendar reform, the spring equinox was on March 25th. At the religious conference held in 325 AD, the spring equinox had already advanced to March 21st. By 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII was in power, the date of the spring equinox had actually moved to March 11th. This Pope resolved to thoroughly reform the calendar. The first order stated that October 4th of that year would be immediately followed by October 15th. Ten days were abolished in the middle, so that the date of the spring equinox would return to March 21st. The second order was that every four hundred years, the previously used calendar would have three fewer leap days, so that the average number of days per year would be slightly less than three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days, to match the length of the equinox and solstice year. From then on, the timing of cold and heat in a year would no longer gradually shift forward. The new calendar we use now is this Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>Reform is truly easier said than done. From our own experience in promoting the new calendar, we can very well appreciate the difficulty of reforming the calendar. At that time, the Gregorian calendar could only be promoted in countries within the sphere of influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Because England followed Protestantism, it did not adopt the new Gregorian calendar until the eighteenth century. Because a dozen days had to be cancelled out of thin air in a month, many contracts were affected, causing quite a few disputes. It is said that the noble ladies in the court were also a part of the fierce opposition to this reform. They were worried about preserving their youth and feared getting old. This reform caused all future New Years to arrive more than ten days earlier, which was equivalent to the east wind hastening aging. It is no wonder they opposed it. As for Russia and Romania, they adopted the Gregorian calendar even later than China. On their calendars, the dates of the old and new calendars are listed side by side. The difference between the two is currently exactly thirteen days. Our lunisolar calendar will not be without companions.</p>
<p>In fact, the Gregorian calendar reform cannot be considered thoroughly thorough. The number of days in each month can differ by as much as three days. Also, there is no fixed relationship between a certain day of the month and the day of the week. We must consult the calendar to know. To eliminate these two drawbacks, several new calendar proposals have been submitted to the League of Nations in recent years. I feel that the League of Nations should not disregard these. Anyway, the aggressor countries are ultimately powerless to sanction, so why not discuss these painless matters more, print more reports, and thereby show the results of its work?</p>
<p>The solar calendar is so named because this calendar is exclusively based on the sun. But if you take care of the sun's path, you can't take care of the moon's departure. Thus, the month only retains an empty name, and does not end and begin with the waxing and waning of the moon. In the past, the months of the lunar calendar were closely related to the new and full moon, and were quite consistent with their names. It also established a leap month system, so that the average length of each year was just right for the cold and heat seasons. It can be said to have achieved a balance on both sides. But a year sometimes has twelve months, and sometimes it can even have thirteen months, which is too uneven. The Islamic calendar is more straightforward, simply taking twelve lunations as a year, and ignoring everything about the cold and heat seasons. Therefore, their year is only two hundred and fifty-four days long. In more than thirty years, their New Year's Day can experience all the different scenery of the four seasons.</p>
<p>In short, the seasons in the calendar are based on astronomical phenomena. The Earth's revolution around the sun is a year. The moon's revolution around the Earth is a month. The Earth's rotation is a day. This is only talking about physical time. As for the psychological time of human life, that should be discussed separately. Clearly, just one day of not seeing each other can feel like three autumns. Clearly, a hundred years can be compared to a flash of lightning. If a person only knows how to be selfish and follow the crowd, benefiting the times in life and leaving no name after death, even if he eats until his intestines are fat and his brain is full, and enjoys a long life, how much different is he from a child who dies young? Conversely, if someone is determined to learn, wholeheartedly wants to explore the mysteries of heaven and earth, and investigate the subtleties of principles, delving into all the thoughts and knowledge of the world, and in their specialized field of study, is able to extensively study the classics, explore the origins and exhaust the details, and contemplate deeply to develop and expand upon it, then such a person can live as long as heaven and earth. If someone has a heart for helping the world, embraces the idea of taking others' hunger and drowning as their own, dedicates themselves to various causes, so that everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation all reach a better state, or fearlessly leads the masses in resisting the invasion of foreign tribes, then such a person, even if they die in battle, will have their noble spirit and eternal loyalty endure forever. Their spirit can be immortal. As for how many times the Earth rotates and revolves around the sun, what increase or decrease does it have to their lifespan?</p>

<p>Special New Year's Edition of Shen Bao Children's Supplement</p>
<h3>New Year's Address</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shou Juan</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the 25th year of the Republic of China, and you children have grown one year older.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the year, and the plan for the year starts from here. Children should value this significant day and not treat it as an ordinary holiday to be lightly passed over.</p>
<p>On this day, you should look back at the past three hundred and sixty-five days. What did you gain? How many books did you read? How many characters did you write? How many essays did you compose? Did your intellectual, moral, and physical education improve? Did you do anything wrong, and did you do anything that you were sorry for to your parents, teachers, siblings, and classmates?</p>
<p>If you studied hard in reading, writing, and composition; if your intellectual, moral, and physical education all improved; and if you did nothing that you were sorry for to your parents, teachers, siblings, and classmates, then that's the best. The past three hundred and sixty-five days were not wasted, and you should redouble your efforts from today onwards.</p>
<p>If you were not diligent in reading, writing, and composition, and only knew how to be lazy; if your intellectual, moral, and physical education did not improve, and your test scores were all failing; if you often skipped school, lied, or bullied classmates, and did all sorts of things that you were sorry for, then from today onwards, you should reform yourself, truly start anew, and become a completely good student.</p>
<p>Children, you must know that the current Republic of China is facing many national crises, and it could not be more dangerous. Don't think that you are young and can just eat, drink, and play, and not care about anything. If the motherland falls, you will be little slaves of a conquered nation, and you will never be able to hold your heads up for the rest of your lives. The most important thing right now is to study hard, so that your intellectual, moral, and physical education improve day by day. When you grow up, you can follow in the footsteps of your parents and teachers and shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the nation.</p>
<h3>Congratulations</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yu Qing</p>
<p>The old address of the calendar on the upper corner of the wall next to my writing desk has a new master today. That's right! A new "New Year's Day" has once again descended upon the human world.</p>
<p>Opening the door early in the morning, I received a New Year's card from a friend from the postman! I had to disappoint my friend's good intentions, and I disgustedly threw this red New Year's card into the wastebasket. Why bother with this? At the very least, it wasted more than ten copper coins!</p>
<p>How annoying! It seems that if you don't say "Congratulations" to someone you meet today, it's considered impolite. Precisely because of this, I am forced to say "Congratulations! Congratulations!" to people I meet! However, I can only blame myself for not even having the courage to change the environment.</p>
<p>That's right! In this day and age, it's fundamentally impossible to "congratulate"!</p>
<p>I'm not good at saying auspicious words, so let's take advantage of today, when everyone is happy, to talk about the origins of "Congratulations"! Legend has it that thousands of years ago, there was a wild beast called "Nian" (Year), whose shape resembled a cow. In ordinary times, it lived deep in caves, but on New Year's Eve, it would come out to eat people. Therefore, at that time, on New Year's Eve, everyone would bolt their doors early and cower in their houses to avoid being harmed by "Nian." However, on the next day—New Year's Day—when they opened the door, they could see that they had not been eaten by "Nian," so everyone would say, "Congratulations! Congratulations!" Gradually, everyone became accustomed to this. Year after year, later generations took this phrase as the opening remark when seeing people on "New Year's Day." It has been passed down to the present.</p>
<p>Although there is no "Nian" that will harm us anymore, if we can take a close look, something even more ferocious than "Nian" is raising its claws and pouncing on us!</p>
<h3>The New Year Has Arrived</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan Ying, a female student at Longhu Elementary School</p>
<p>The new year has arrived,</p>
<p>Good birds are singing sweet songs;</p>
<p>Old plum trees are blooming with bright flowers;</p>
<p>How happy we are!</p>
<p>The new year has arrived,</p>
<p>Younger brothers and sisters put on new clothes</p>
<p>In the hall, we see our parents,</p>
<p>We clasp our hands, bow our waists,</p>
<p>And shout, "Good luck this year!"</p>
<h3>Let's Have a Happy Day</h3>
<p>— Yan Chong Lou</p>
<p>At this time of the New Year, everything presents a new look. Children, from today onwards, you have all grown a year older, and everyone's heart is truly happy when they think about it! Everyone wants to have a happy day, right?</p>
<p>But in the past, out of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, which day were the children not living a happy life? When it's cold, they have clothes to wear; when they're hungry, they have food to eat; in school, they have the education of teachers; at home, they have the love of their parents; and they also have toys and entertainment. Which day were these happy children not living happily?</p>
<p>Then look at those poor children; because of rural bankruptcy, floods, droughts, and wars… they have no choice but to wander everywhere! Struggling in the cold! Suffering from hunger! They have no money to go to school! Their parents have either died or been separated! Even if they stay together, they cannot take care of each other! Not only have they been living a hard life every day in the past, but they can't even have a happy day at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Isn't the life of these poor children too pitiful?</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the generally happy children, when they are happy in the New Year, will not forget that there are still poor children who cannot even be happy for one day. I further hope that children can make their bodies stronger than before from today onwards, make their minds richer than before, and take on the heavy responsibility of improving society in the future, fundamentally rescuing these poor children from deep waters and scorching fire.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day Sledding</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>A Wang led a wooden horse, walking on a hillside.</p>
<p>A Li shouted from the bottom of the hillside: "A Wang, come down quickly; let's celebrate New Year's Day."</p>
<p>A Wang then rode the wooden horse and slid down the hillside, heading straight for A Li.</p>
<p>A Li couldn't dodge in time, and was knocked over into a somersault by the wooden horse. A Wang said: "Celebrating New Year's Day!"</p>
<h3>Future New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Kang Jian Zhai Fu</p>
<p>How many children in the Republic of China are fortunate enough to read the newspaper every day?</p>
<p>How many are there who can take a few minutes to read the newspaper on a joyous New Year's Day?</p>
<p>And how many are there who, when picking up the newspaper, want to find some news that they can smile at or a novel and interesting conversation? Didn't Shanghai hold a joint happy gathering for poor children at major theaters during the Christmas holiday, with 15,000 poor children who had never received education attending? Besides these 15,000 poor children, weren't there countless others who, because they couldn't get tickets, were left outside the door, dejected? One corner of Shanghai is like this, and one can imagine what other places are like. The local area is like this, and one can imagine what the whole country is like. Taking it one step further, there are countless homeless poor children all over the world.</p>
<p>On happy days, happy people are doubly happy; poor children appear doubly miserable.</p>
<p>The right to exist that nature endows to humanity is originally the same. But apart from eating air, enjoying the sun, and admiring the bright moon and clear breeze, which are completely equal, the necessary conditions for other aspects of life, such as clothing, food, and housing, have ten thousand times more inequality. Do you think this inequality is created by heaven and earth? Is it destined by fate? Or can it be improved by human power?</p>
<p>If you believe that this is not destined by fate, but can be improved by human power, then who is responsible for this transformation?</p>
<p>You alone naturally do not have this great ability, but you alone cannot be without this world-saving heart.</p>
<p>Every child who reads the newspaper, harboring these great wishes to save the world, should start with themselves, be self-reliant and help others, achieve success themselves and help others achieve success, from the revival of the nation to the transformation of the world. Let all the children in the future New Year's Day be happy and cheer, as if ascending the Terrace of Spring Sun.</p>
<p>Such a world is a rational human world!</p>
<p>Such a New Year's Day is a New Year's Day celebrated in peace and prosperity all over the world!</p>
<h3>Start Writing a Diary From Today</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Children's Year," "Children's National Goods Year," "Children's ×× Year," year after year. In this year after year, what exactly has our country done? Children, have you ever thought about this?</p>
<p>"All things of the past are like yesterday's death, all things of the future are like today's birth." Perhaps everyone thought this way on New Year's Day last year, and perhaps everyone was very excited on New Year's Day last year to make great efforts in all aspects in the coming year. But in the past year, besides muddling through day after day, besides increasing in age by one year, what achievements of effort can be told to others? Today is New Year's Day again. Today is New Year's Day of the 25th year of the Republic of China. I hope that the children's goals of effort will not be too high or too great, and that they will not hope to become a great hero who can immediately lead the country to wealth and strength with a single wave of their hand. What I hope from the children is to do something very small and easy to do in the coming year that follows today—write a few lines in a diary every day.</p>
<p>The writing of a diary that I am advocating here, children, is slightly different from the diary you write in school. For example, "Today I followed my older brother to visit the Great World," "Today my aunt came and gave me a box of candy and two toys," "Ah Mao next door was beaten twice by his mother today because he refused to study," etc., are all unnecessary. What I hope children will write in their diary is: - Notes on reading. Such as the words and deeds of ancient sages and philosophers, as long as they are beneficial to one of the nation, society, family, and individual, record them all. - Notes on reading newspapers. Record it whenever you read in the newspaper that children or celebrities from various countries have done something beneficial to society and the community. Also, record a summary of how the politics of a certain country are, how the economy of a certain country is, how the production of a certain country is, as well as the politics, economy, production, education, and the import and export of domestic and foreign goods of our country. - Notes on life. Such as reasonable or unreasonable things that you see or hear your parents, older siblings, teachers, and friends do, or reasonable or unreasonable things that you experience yourself, or stories of courage and righteousness or unfair events that you see in school, at home, or on the street, record them all one by one.</p>
<p>Record them every day without interruption for 365 days a year. When you are free, turn them over, look at them, and reflect on yourself. All things of the past are like being in the present, and you can use everything of the past as the compass for your future life.</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 25th year. I hope that children will write a diary every day without stopping, starting from today.</p>

<h3>General Report on the Shen Bao's Solicitation of "Children's Voluntary Writings"</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>New Year Greetings</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 25th year of the Republic of China. According to custom, I should write an article of congratulations, offering words of hope to the nation above and to our compatriots below. However, upon careful reflection, such articles are too empty and too idealistic. We perform this routine every year, yet the nation deteriorates year by year. Now, with powerful neighbors pressing our borders and the authorities at a loss, the nation's dignity is swept away. What kind of world is this becoming? Dear children, you are the future masters of our nation. If things continue like this, I fear what state you will find yourselves in when you come of age! Unfavorable words are not usually spoken during the New Year, but to our beloved children, with "danger in my heart," I cannot but speak the truth! To turn the topic around, as the nation's situation is so dire, I sincerely hope that you children will think fundamentally, redouble your efforts, and each seek ways to save the nation, taking the ancient saying of "many hands make light work" as a self-encouragement and motivation. Below is a report on the process of this newspaper's solicitation of "Children's Voluntary Writings":</p>
<p>(I) The Beginning and End of the Solicitation</p>
<p>The motivation for this newspaper's solicitation of "Children's Voluntary Writings" was already published in last year's Double Tenth National Day special issue. At that time, the deadline for submissions was set for forty days—from October 11th to the end of November. To facilitate statistics, I created a record table to record the number of letters received each day. Initially, we received two or three pieces, then dozens, then forty or fifty, with a maximum exceeding one hundred and sixteen pieces. Within each letter, there were either one or two essays, or five or six, with a maximum of thirty or forty. Combined, within forty days, we received over two thousand letters, with the total number of manuscripts exceeding three thousand. After the deadline, submissions continued to arrive in abundance, but according to the rules, they were no longer accepted. The children who responded to this solicitation came from as near as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and as far as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Kang, and the border provinces, covering nearly the entire country. There were also many from the lost territories of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, but unfortunately, they were all sent from Tianjin and Beiping. They are refugee children unable to return home, and we express our deepest sympathy to them. Starting December 1st, we began reading the submissions, finishing on the 15th. The judging was made public on the 20th, and the rankings were determined on the 22nd. According to the rules, the results are announced today.</p>
<p>(II) The Judging Process</p>
<p>The evaluation of the submissions was indeed a laborious task because there were over three thousand essays in total. Each essay averaged about four hundred words, totaling one million two hundred thousand words. Evaluating each essay individually was naturally very time-consuming. To maintain a uniform standard, it was impossible for just a few people to read the manuscripts. Therefore, I was appointed to read them first. Starting November 1st, I worked all day, reading two hundred essays a day, and it took me half a month to complete the initial work. I divided the selected manuscripts into three grades: (A), (B), and (C). I selected eighteen essays for Grade A, one hundred and five for Grade B, and thirty-two for Grade C, totaling one hundred and eighteen essays according to the rules, with an additional thirty-seven as alternates. These manuscripts were handed over to Mr. Zhou Shoujuan for a second review, and he carefully looked through them again, removing the thirty-seven alternates. His suggestion was to have Mr. Chen Heqin, Mr. Chen Xuanxian, Mr. Zhou Mengxiong, and Mr. Hu Zhongchi decide the rankings. After the final review by the four gentlemen, the top eighteen prizes from first to fourth place were determined. The remaining entries from nineteenth to one hundred and eighteenth place were ranked in order of submission. We are confident that we were very cautious throughout the judging process, knowing the hard work of the three thousand children who wrote these essays. How could we let them down? Unfortunately, the number of prizes was limited, and we could not accept all submissions, which we greatly regret.</p>
<p>(III) Various Analyses</p>
<p>Among these three thousand essays, about seventy or eighty percent complied with the solicitation guidelines, while ten or twenty percent did not meet the requirements. The largest number of submissions came from Jiangsu Province, followed by Zhejiang and Anhui. The ages were mostly between eleven and fifteen, with fourteen being the most common age. The most common grade level was sixth grade. The writing was generally fluent, the thoughts were practical, and the calligraphy was neat. I believe that many of these children are promising new citizens of the future.</p>
<p>(IV) General Aspirations</p>
<p>The aspirations of the children are truly admirable! I have recorded their general aspirations, such as becoming scientists, educators, engineers, aviators, military strategists, doctors, agronomists, politicians, diplomats, mineralogists, soldiers who save the country, and healthy citizens. In the case of girls, they wish to be virtuous wives and good mothers in peacetime and nurses at the front lines in wartime. Their intention is that only science can revitalize China, and only education can save China; expanding aviation and strengthening national defense can alleviate national crises; developing agriculture and mining can enrich people's lives... These aspirations are indeed what China needs most. I hope that the children will all embrace these aspirations and resolutely put them into practice, fulfilling their duties as citizens.</p>
<p>(V) Special Sentiments</p>
<p>What we found most satisfying in this solicitation was that every piece of writing expressed patriotic sentiments, such as advocating saving the nation through science to resolve national crises; recovering lost territories; reviving the nation; and criticizing reality. They spoke very thoroughly and sincerely, demonstrating that today's children all have a sense of national identity and patriotic thoughts, unlike those in the past who were ignorant. There were also many children who wrote humorous, satirical, and witty pieces, which proves that the Chinese people are unanimously aware of the current situation, especially the oppressive state of affairs of the past four years of national crisis. Among these three thousand children, the fortunate ones are ultimately few, while the majority are suffering from hardship and disaster. The misfortune and suffering revealed between the lines, such as the loss of parents, natural disasters, poverty, the turmoil of war and bandits, the trampling of their hometowns by enemy cavalry, and the suffering of illegal bullying, make the reader's heart ache!</p>
<p>(VI) Apology</p>
<p>We are very sorry that we had to reject over two thousand eight hundred of the three thousand submissions. Please forgive us and do not be discouraged. The museum plans to hold a solicitation or examination every year in the future. You will have many more opportunities to win prizes. Do not dwell on momentary gains and losses. Goodbye, children!</p>

<p>Special Telegraph Edition</p>
<h3>New Hopes for the Telecommunications Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>As the Western proverb says, "Hope is the mother of fact." Everyone has some kind of hope, and to achieve that hope brings satisfaction, while exceeding that hope brings joy beyond expectations. New Year's Day is the beginning of a new year, spring approaches as winter ends, old things are cast aside and new things are established. The social landscape is full of infinite new atmospheres, and the meaning of life is full of infinite new hopes. Therefore, on New Year's Day, we are delighted and congratulate each other, wishing for the fulfillment of a year's worth of hopes.</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a state-owned enterprise. On this New Year's Day, from both a national and business perspective, there are great hopes for the future of this year—1936. This is because the telecommunications industry has the greatest relationship with national institutions. If the country exists and problems arise, if the skin does not exist, where will the hair attach? The telecommunications industry will perish together. Now, I will briefly describe our hopes for this year as follows:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the National Aspect:</p>
<p>Hope for the Consolidation of World Peace: Since the Manchurian Incident, peace in East Asia has been threatened. Since the Italo-Ethiopian War, world peace has been further shaken. Observing the international situation, it is becoming increasingly urgent, and a world war is predicted for this year. Our country is located in East Asia and is truly forced into this situation. The Chinese people have a deep love for peace, almost innate, and will never abandon peace until it is completely hopeless. If peace is once broken, international telecommunications will be the first to be ravaged, and the various losses are unimaginable.</p>
<p>Hope for Domestic Political Stability: To become a modern country, it is necessary to engage in construction. However, political stability must precede construction. Looking at various domestic construction projects that have achieved some success, are they not all thanks to the relative stability of recent years? Especially telecommunications construction is related to public security. If the political situation does not trend towards stability, official telegrams will increase, commercial telegrams will decrease, and business will be greatly affected. Other common farces of the warlord era, such as cutting down telegraph poles, occupying telegraph lines, and interfering with telecommunications administration, will occur. Now the central organization is solid and strong, and there is hope for clarification in domestic politics.</p>
<p>Hope for National Economic Development: Since the silver price issue arose, our country's finances have been greatly disrupted, and economic panic has reached its peak! Fortunately, our government has taken effective measures, implemented currency management, increased funds, and the economy has shown vitality. Various industrial sectors have an upward trend. As industry thrives, the use of telecommunications will increase, and as users increase, the business will develop daily.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Social Aspect:</p>
<p>Hope that Political and Military Authorities Maintain Telecommunications: Telecommunications is a powerful tool for conveying political and military news, and it is needed very much. However, when using it, it must be handled in accordance with the established regulations, and there must be no abuse. In recent years, military authorities have helped to crack down on private official telegrams and the unauthorized attachment of military telephone lines to telegraph poles, and significant results have been achieved. As for government and military agencies sending telegrams and renting telephones, some have not paid according to regulations. The past is gone; in the future, it is hoped that government and military agencies will pay their electricity bills in full, so that the economy of telecommunications can be adjusted and construction can be undertaken.</p>
<p>Hope that People from All Walks of Life Work Together: Telecommunications is one of the public utilities, and it needs the cooperation of people from all walks of life in order to improve. Therefore, adjusting the relationship with the public is the policy of the Ministry of Communications. If people from all walks of life have any opinions on telecommunications, they can sincerely state them or inform the business inspectors. The telecommunications authorities will adopt them sincerely. Since the implementation of the business inspection system, the public has had a good impression. We hope to further cooperate effectively so that telecommunications equipment can meet the public's expectations.</p>
<p>Hope that Entrepreneurs Organize Electrical Material Factories: It is found that most of our country's electrical materials are imported, and profits overflow to foreign countries, no less than several million each year. Moreover, once international wars occur, the source is cut off, and telecommunications are in danger of immediate stagnation. Now the Ministry of Communications stipulates that domestic electrical materials should be given priority, but the quality is lacking and the supply cannot meet the demand. It is hoped that entrepreneurs will invest in building several electrical material factories this year, directly developing domestic industry and indirectly maintaining telecommunications, which is a win-win situation. Why not do it!</p>
<p>The above are general hopes regarding the national aspect and individual hopes regarding the social aspect, both of which are closely related to the telecommunications industry. If these can be realized one by one this year, the future of telecommunications will truly depend on it. As for the staff of this publication, we hope that people from all walks of life will not hesitate to give us advice. We have been praying for this day, and not just since this New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>The International Radio Station in the Twenty-Fourth Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>— Zhefu</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications International Radio Station has been established for more than five years. The entire process of planning and construction of the station, as well as the expansion of its business equipment, has been recorded in the special New Year's Day issues of this publication in the twenty-third and twenty-fourth years of the Republic of China. After more than four years of painstaking operation by the Ministry of Communications, the station has been established on a large scale. Since the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, it has further substantially enriched its equipment and improved its business, so that the emerging state-owned international telecommunications business of our country can reach the realm of prosperity and excellence. Now, on the occasion of the New Year in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the general situation of the station's business development in the past year is described as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Business Improvement:</p>
<p>Expanding Communication Circuits - Before the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the International Radio Station had communication circuits to Hong Kong, Manila, Java, Saigon, San Francisco, Berlin, Paris, Geneva, and Moscow. In the twenty-third year, routes to London and Tokyo were opened successively, so that famous capitals and major cities in the world could be reached by radio telegram. However, in order to expand China's international communication business, the Ministry of Communications continued to plan for the development of new circuits for the International Radio Station. In January of the twenty-fourth year, the Rome route was officially opened, making communication between China and Italy more rapid. As for other planned circuits, communication tests were also conducted one after another. The communication circuits were also adjusted according to the business volume, and the communication speed was greatly increased compared to before.</p>
<p>Improving Retransmission Speed - A large number of telegrams from various parts of China are sent abroad. These telegrams were previously transferred by the wired and wireless telegraph offices of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. A special line was installed between the telegram office and the International Radio Station, and the transmission was very rapid. Later, in order to reduce the retransmission time, the Ministry of Communications sought further improvement and specially installed multiple multiplexers in the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and the International Radio Station, so that important bureaus in China could communicate directly with the International Radio Station using call signs. Since its implementation, it has not only saved time but also become more accurate. The people in the interior have praised it as convenient.</p>
<p>Post Offices Collecting Telegrams - Since the Ministry of Communications implemented the postal-telecommunication cooperation method, post offices in Shanghai have collected international radio telegrams. At the beginning of the implementation, it was temporarily limited to cash telegrams. Later, in order to facilitate billing for all sectors, starting from April 1 of the twenty-fourth year, senders holding various account books of the International Radio Station could send foreign telegrams to nearby post offices. The number of people from all walks of life who sent such telegrams to the post office increased particularly, and they all praised it as convenient.</p>
<p>Motorcycles Picking Up Telegrams - Since post offices in Shanghai began collecting international radio telegrams, all sectors have felt very convenient. However, the urban area of Shanghai is vast, and sometimes it is still inconvenient to send telegrams to the post office. In such cases, senders can notify the International Radio Station by telephone to send someone to pick up the telegram. This matter was previously handled by the International Radio Station's messengers. However, the messengers were not familiar with calculating the telegram fees or collecting money, so the telegrams picked up were limited to account holders. Since the twenty-fourth year, the International Radio Station has specially purchased motorcycles and set up several special personnel. As soon as a telegram arrives, they immediately drive to pick it up, just like ordering goods by telephone from a store. Even if customers do not leave their homes, they can communicate with foreign countries at any time.</p>
<p>Strictly Implementing Error Correction and Proofreading - The Ministry of Communications, in view of the importance of the accuracy of telegrams, specially approved the International Radio Station to recruit thirty proofreading trainees at the end of the twenty-third year. The station actively trained them to take on the task of proofreading telegrams. Whether it was incoming, outgoing, or retransmitted telegrams, they were proofread immediately after being received or sent. If there were any errors, they would be notified for correction immediately without waiting for the person concerned to inquire. After one year of implementation, the number of inquiries about the text of telegrams by senders and receivers has been sharply reduced, and the society's trust in international radio telegrams has become stronger.</p>
<p>Promoting Inspection Methods - In order to widely solicit opinions from telegram users on the telegraph bureaus and stations, so as to seek further improvement, the Ministry of Communications ordered all bureaus and stations across the country to set up business inspectors to be responsible for all inspection matters related to foreign telegram services. They were allowed to pay attention to international radio telegrams transmitted through the International Radio Station. As for the internal procedures of incoming and outgoing telegrams, each part of the International Radio Station also checked step by step. In case of any errors, they could be immediately corrected. Since the twenty-fourth year, in order to tighten this internal inspection work, the International Radio Station has added several more business inspectors, who specialize in all inspection matters related to business. International business has therefore become more sophisticated. In addition, the station has previously hired messengers to deliver incoming telegrams to various places, strictly limiting the delivery time. Since the twenty-fourth year, it has also been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to set up several inspectors of messengers who specialize in inspecting the delivery work of messengers. All these are for the improvement of business, which is also for the convenience of telegram users.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Business News - In order to make all sectors understand the regulations and facilities of telegrams, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated measures for broadcasting and publicizing telecommunications business, ordering all important bureaus and stations across the country to promote them separately. The International Radio Station believes that international radio telegrams are an emerging business and should be publicized to the public. Therefore, it has consulted with the Shanghai Broadcasting Station under the Ministry of Communications and agreed to broadcast several times a day, announcing the implementation of various new regulations, changes in prices, and other business news.</p>
<p>Printing and Issuing Telegram Supplies - In order to facilitate all sectors to understand the situation of international telegrams, the International Radio Station previously printed a small booklet, issuing one issue per month, in both Chinese and English. Many sectors requested this booklet by mail. The station is now working to facilitate telegram users and has specially manufactured printed materials related to telegrams, such as various sizes and styles of reply slips, inquiry telegram slips, telegram envelopes, etc. If users need them, they can notify them by telephone at any time. If the monthly quantity required is agreed upon, the station will send them by month in order to make it convenient for both parties.</p>
<p>Regarding Equipment Enrichment:</p>
<p>Installing Wireless Telephones - The wireless telephone components ordered by the Ministry of Communications from the United Kingdom were shipped to China in the spring of the twenty-fourth year. The International Radio Station started installing them and completed the installation in May. Later, it began to test them and conducted test calls with London, Tokyo, and other places. The results were very good. It can officially communicate with foreign countries in February of this year. As for domestic wireless telephones, they have also been installed by the station. As soon as the test war in Hubei and Guangdong is over, it can be opened for commercial use.</p>
<p>Adding a High-Power Modulator - The International Radio Station's True Love transmitting station's Arsi-A transmitter is suitable for both telegraph and telephone use. In the autumn of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, it ordered a high-power modulator from the United States. As soon as it is shipped to Shanghai, it can be installed. After that, the machine can be used for both communication and telephone, and the efficiency will be greatly increased.</p>
<p>Adding Receiving and Transmitting Directional Antennas - The speed of long-distance communication is closely related to directional antennas. Therefore, in order to increase the efficiency of telegrams, the International Radio Station added four directional receiving antennas and one directional transmitting antenna in the twenty-fourth year. There are also four directional receiving antennas and two directional transmitting antennas under construction, which will also be completed soon.</p>
<p>Testing the Frequencies of Various Stations - In recent years, short-wave communication has developed rapidly, and the number of radio stations worldwide has increased rapidly, resulting in a denser distribution of frequencies. Therefore, the stability of the frequency has become an important issue, and accurate standard wavemeters are one of the main equipment of major radio stations. The International Radio Station's standard wavemeter has been installed and used in the twenty-fourth year. In addition to measuring the frequency of each transmitter of the station every day, it also calibrates the frequencies of foreign radio stations at any time as needed. In case of interference, it can immediately determine the truth. Recently, it was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to measure the frequencies of radio stations across the country. In the future, the frequencies of stations at home and abroad will have a standard.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Wireless Electrical Components - The International Radio Station was ordered to manufacture three 500-watt wireless radio transmitters and three 1-kilowatt transmitters for domestic communication in the twenty-fourth year. Each transmitter uses a constant temperature controlled master oscillator, so the frequency is more stable and can be used for high-speed transmission. Except for the first and second machines, which have been completed and transported to Beiping and other places for installation, the rest are being tested and manufactured and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>The above sections are the major business of the International Radio Station in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China. In February of this year, international wireless telephones can be officially opened for commercial use. This brand new business in the world, our country has been able to follow the construction, which is enough to show that our country's traffic authorities have the spirit of catching up. I hope that the staff of the station will continue to work hard in this spirit, so that the business will be refined and improved day by day. Next New Year's Day, we will have more significant achievements to report to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Improves Method for Sending Telegrams to Multiple Locations</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>—Attention to Draftsmen and Translators in All Government Agencies—</p>
<p>It is common practice to send a telegram to many locations simultaneously. For example, the central government might issue urgent orders to various provinces, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs might send instructions to overseas embassies and consulates. These telegrams often contain identical text. However, according to regulations, each telegram with the same text should only list one destination, just as each letter can only have one address. This is a simple principle that everyone should understand. In reality, however, official telegrams issued by government and military agencies in our country often list three, five, or even dozens of locations and names on each telegram. The reason is simply to save the trouble of making multiple copies of the text. However, when the telegraph office receives these telegrams, it must go through several times more procedures, which can sometimes lead to many problems. Here, I will first list the drawbacks of writing multiple destinations on a single telegram:</p>
<p>1.  Delayed Transmission Due to Sequential Sending: The telegraph office has a vast network of lines extending in all directions. If a telegram sent to multiple locations is divided into separate copies for each destination, the telegraph office can send them simultaneously in the east, south, west, and north directions without any delay. However, if multiple destinations are written on a single telegram, the telegraph office can only send it to the east first, then to the south, west, and north in sequence. Assuming it takes five minutes to transmit each direction, the telegram sent to the last direction will be delayed by fifteen minutes. In reality, telegraph offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places have as many as twenty or thirty lines. If the telegram has many destinations, the delay for the last direction will be even longer!</p>
<p>2.  Omissions Due to Haste: A telegram with only one destination is simple and clear, so telegraph office personnel are unlikely to miss it. However, a telegram with twenty or thirty destinations, names, and addresses can become complex and confusing, and omissions are inevitable due to occasional carelessness. When the omission is discovered and a supplementary telegram is sent, it may be too late.</p>
<p>3.  Misunderstandings and Omissions in Relay: Telegraph office lines are not always direct. If the distance is too great, the telegram must be relayed through an intermediate office. If a telegram lists many destinations, such as A, B, C, and D, office X should normally transmit it to A and B. However, if the line to B is disrupted, it will only send it to A. At the same time, office Y should normally only transmit it to C and D. However, because office Y has not received a public telegram from office X about the line disruption to B, it still only sends it to C and D. As a result, B is inevitably omitted from the relay. The situation with telegraph office lines is very complex. This is just a simple example.</p>
<p>4.  Redundant Transmission: Following the example above, if offices X and Y both send to B regardless of the line situation, redundancy is inevitable. Therefore, it often happens that the same telegram is delivered to the recipient two or three times or more. This not only wastes labor and materials for the telegraph office but also easily leads to misunderstandings by the recipient, who may think the telegraph office is incompetent. In reality, when a telegram lists too many destinations, and office X sends it to office Y and office Z, office Y may think that office X has not yet sent it. The telegraph office has tried many methods to avoid this problem, but it cannot be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>5.  Slow Delivery: A telegram with many destinations, names, and addresses, such as A, B, C, D, and E, will have the telegram destined for Mr. A in location A sent along with the names and addresses of locations B, C, D, and E. Isn't this cumbersome and time-consuming? The more destinations, the slower the transmission!</p>
<p>6.  Wasteful Telegraph Fees: When calculating the telegraph fee for a telegram with many destinations and names, the telegraph office still calculates it as if each destination were a separate telegram. Not only is there no discount, but the fee is actually much higher because the number of characters in the destinations and names is included in each telegram. We often see telegrams where the actual message is less than forty or fifty characters, but the number of characters in the destinations, names, and addresses is two or three hundred. As a result, the fee for each telegram is calculated based on two or three hundred characters. Isn't this a very worthwhile loss?</p>
<p>The six drawbacks mentioned above are all closely related to the interests of the sender, and they naturally cause great difficulties for the telegraph office's operations. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications recently drafted a "Method for Sending Telegrams with Identical Text to Multiple Locations," aiming to protect the interests of senders and avoid operational errors. The main points of this method are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  For telegrams with the same text sent to multiple destinations, each copy should only list one destination. In other words, a telegram sent to ten locations should be divided into ten copies. However, to reduce the sender's burden, only one copy of the text needs to be written. The other nine copies only need to list the destination, name, and address. The text field should simply state "Text is the same as the telegram sent to Mr./Ms. [Name] at [Location]." It is not necessary to copy the text for each telegram. The procedure is very simple.</p>
<p>2.  If a telegram is sent to various provinces and cities or to a large number of people, and the recipients should know that the telegram is a general notice, it is not necessary to list all the destinations and names on a single telegram. Simply add the words "General Notice" before the destination. The telegraph office will add a special marker to inform the recipient.</p>
<p>3.  If the telegram is not a general notice, but the recipient should know that the telegram is also sent to Mr./Ms. [Name] at [Location], you can state in the text "In addition to the separate telegram to [Name], etc." It is not necessary to list the destinations and names before the text.</p>
<p>4.  If a telegram is sent to several people in the same location, you can follow the method for sending distributed telegrams and add the words "Distributed to [Number] copies" before the destination. It is not necessary to divide it into several copies according to the example of telegrams with identical text.</p>
<p>The above methods have been submitted by the Ministry of Communications to the Executive Yuan, which has forwarded them to the National Government for a circular order to all government agencies, effective from January 1, 1936. It is hoped that personnel in all government agencies responsible for drafting or translating telegrams will prepare in advance. If frequently used destinations and names can be pre-printed on telegraph paper, and only one copy of the text needs to be copied temporarily, then you can simply select a few pre-printed papers and hand them over to the telegraph office for transmission. This will be both convenient and quick.</p>
<h3>New Year</h3>
<p>— Yizhong</p>
<p>Thousands, ten thousands times,</p>
<p>the tune of the New Year gong's clatter,</p>
<p>Fireworks' stars</p>
<p>chasing the innocent hearts of neighboring children.</p>
<p>Fragrant,</p>
<p>the aroma of New Year's cake flies over from the neighbor's wall,</p>
<p>Kindly urging a drink, light and graceful voices,</p>
<p>filled with the joy of reunion!</p>
<p>Mountains and seas block the warm, melting family,</p>
<p>The cold room, emptily guarding the frozen inkstone!</p>
<p>Loneliness freezes the traveler's heart,</p>
<p>Comfort, closeness, where to seek them?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of knocking,</p>
<p>bringing a New Year's greeting telegram from home,</p>
<p>Every word exceptionally tender,</p>
<p>Today, ah, it's read at least a thousand, ten thousand times!</p>
<p>After all, it's the effect of science,</p>
<p>Distant affections instantly delivered,</p>
<p>Countless words squeezed out from under the frozen brush,</p>
<p>The person by the door longing for my reply.</p>
<h3>The Expansion of Long-Distance Telephone Lines in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In our country where education is not yet universal, the need for long-distance telephones is actually more pressing than that of telegrams. In addition, with the increasing prevalence of city telephones in various places, the connection of long-distance lines is an urgent matter for domestic communication. In the past, although the authorities in charge of communications had already established a somewhat scaled system for the installation of telegraph lines, long-distance telephone lines were few and far between, and major domestic cities were still unable to communicate by telephone, which was a major shortcoming in telecommunications and transportation. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications now has a plan to build long-distance telephones in nine provinces, with the aim of connecting major domestic cities. Through hard work in the past year, the lines of Jingwu (Nanjing to Wuhu), Jintian (Jinan to Tianjin), Jinqing (Jinan to Qingdao), Jingtong (Nanjing to Tongshan), Hutong (Shanghai to Nantong), Zhenhuai (Zhenjiang to Huaiyin), Wenfu (Wenzhou to Fuzhou), Xiafu (Xiamen to Fuzhou), Bacheng (Ba County to Chengdu), and Bagui (Ba County to Guiyang) have been completed. The general situation of telephone communication on each line is briefly described below, and readers are kindly requested to pay attention.</p>
<p>1.  Nanjing to Wuhu: There was originally a pair of iron telephone lines between Nanjing and Wuhu, which were crossed over to allow simultaneous communication of telegrams and telephones. However, because the telephone lines were erected on the same poles as the telegraph lines of Huhang (Shanghai to Hankou), Jinghan (Beijing to Hankou), and other lines, the telephone lines were often opened for telegraph communication and telephone communication was suspended whenever the telegraph lines were disrupted, which was criticized by the public. Now, copper lines have been added between Jingwu to open for telephone communication, and the original pair of iron telephone lines has been opened for communication between Nanjing and the cities of Dangtu, Taiping, Jiangningzhen, and Banqiaozhen between Jingwu, so as to avoid congestion.</p>
<p>2.  Jinan to Tianjin: There was also an iron telephone line between Jinan and Tianjin that was opened for telephone communication, but communication was inevitably difficult because there were too many offices in each section. It has been found that copper lines have been used for telephone communication between Pingjin (Beijing to Tianjin) and Jinqing. The telephone line between Jinjin urgently needs to be replaced with copper lines for erection in order to facilitate communication. This section of copper lines has been completed in May of this year under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications. The offices in each section are still communicating on iron lines in order to ease communication.</p>
<p>3.  Jinan to Qingdao: There were originally two pairs of copper telephone lines between Jinan and Qingdao, one for direct communication between Jinan and Qingdao, and one for communication between various locations in the section. Now, because telephone services between Jinan and Qingdao are busy and communication is congested, two pairs of telephone lines have been added between Jinan and Qingdao. The two pairs are changed to open direct communication between Jinan and Qingdao, one pair is opened for communication between Jinan, Zhangdian, Weixian, and Qingdao, and the other pair is opened for communication between various locations along the line.</p>
<p>4.  Nanjing to Tongshan: There was no direct telephone line between Jingtong. Now, copper lines have also been erected to open communication between Nanjing, Bengbu, and Tongshan. For communication between Jingjin and the towns of Suxian, Linhuaiguan, Mingguang, and Chuxian, two telegraph lines are used to cross over and allow simultaneous communication of telegrams and telephones.</p>
<p>5.  Shanghai to Nantong: The telecommunications and transportation between Hutong are very important due to commercial relations. The Ministry of Communications is now erecting a pair of copper lines between these two major cities, and also introducing Wuxi along the way to open communication between Hu Xi and Tong.</p>
<p>6.  Zhenjiang to Huaiyin: There was also an iron line between Zhenjiang and Huaiyin for telephone communication, but communication was congested due to too many offices in the section. In order to improve this situation, the Ministry of Communications specially erected a pair of copper lines between Zhenhuai to open communication between Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, and Huaiyin, while the original iron telephone line was opened for communication in the section.</p>
<p>7.  Fuzhou to Yongjia: There was no electrical connection between Fuzhou and Yongjia (i.e., Wenzhou). Even telegrams had to be forwarded through other routes, which was very inconvenient. In order to facilitate communication between Fuyong, a pair of copper lines were specially erected to open telephone communication. Also, since the telephone services on this route are not yet fully developed, the towns of Fuding, Fu'an, Luoyuan, Guantou, and Mawei along the line are also connected on this line.</p>
<p>8.  Fuzhou to Xiamen: A pair of copper lines has now been erected between Fuxia to open telephone communication. However, because there are too many places along the line for telephone communication, communication is congested. The Ministry of Communications is now planning to cross over the first and third telegraph lines between Fuxia to allow simultaneous communication of telegrams and telephones in the section, and to open communication between Fuzhou, Jinjiang, and Xiamen using the existing pair of copper lines in order to avoid crowding.</p>
<p>9.  Ba County to Chengdu: There was no telephone line between Ba County and Chengdu. Later, due to local commercial and military relations, a pair of copper telephone lines was erected to open telephone communication.</p>
<p>10. Ba County to Guiyang: There was no direct telephone line between Ba County and Guiyang. In order to meet the local military needs, a pair of copper lines was also erected to open telephone communication.</p>
<p>The above are all constructions of trunk lines. As for branch lines, telegraph lines are currently used to open dual-use telegraph and telephone communication, and there has been a lot of expansion in the past year. This will be described in another article.</p>
<h3>The Realization of Postal and Telegraph Agencies at Train Stations</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>In order to facilitate communication for passengers and to closely connect the entire state-owned transportation business, the two ministries of Railways and Communications had a plan to establish postal and telegraph agencies at railway stations across the country. The two parties agreed to first conduct a pilot program at nine stations on the Jinghu (Nanjing to Shanghai) and Huhu Yong (Shanghai to Hangzhou and Ningbo) lines: Nanjing Xiaguan, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai North Station, Shanghai South Station, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou City Station. When the management has been effective in the future, it will be gradually promoted in order to achieve popularity. However, the facilities of the postal and telegraph agency at the station are still a pioneering undertaking in our country, and it involves three items of railway, post, and telegraph. Not only must the postal and telegraph bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications this month communicate with each other, but also the Railway Administration under the management of the Ministry of Railways should cooperate. After exchanging views on this matter, the three parties have made a decision, and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has sent representatives to the Shanghai Postal Administration and the Jinghu Huhu Yong Railway Administration to personally inspect the locations of the postal and telegraph agencies at the stations along the two lines and to stipulate the opening hours. As follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing Xiaguan Station: The postal and telegraph agency is located in the station information desk. The station is in front, and the words "Postal and Telegraph Agency" are written in glass paint to identify it. The location of the agency is very important and it is also the only way in and out. It is very easy for passengers to find it if they want to send a telegram or mail a letter, which is very convenient. In addition, the agency is open day and night on weekdays without any restrictions, except on Sundays and public holidays, when the sale of mail and telegrams and public telephones is handled in accordance with the office hours stipulated by the post office.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang West Station: The station already has a public telephone retail store. The three parties of the road, post, and telecommunications believe that the retail store is located next to the ticket office and is close to the platform, which is a very good location. Therefore, the original location of the store was expanded and reorganized into a postal and telegraph agency, with business hours from 8:00 to 24:00. However, on Sundays and public holidays, in addition to the normal sale of reports, all postal mail is received and sent within the office hours stipulated by the post office.</p>
<p>Changzhou Station: The postal and telegraph agency at the station is located in the station's telegraph room. The agency has a window facing the platform and a door near the ticket office. There are windows on both sides to facilitate business. There are no restrictions on business hours. The mails on Sundays and public holidays are received and sent at the time stipulated by the post office.</p>
<p>Wuxi Station: The postal and telegraph agency at the station is located next to the platform, which is the main thoroughfare for passengers, and the location is very good. Business hours are from 7:00 to 21:00, and mail on Sundays and public holidays is handled according to the post office's office hours.</p>
<p>Suzhou Station: The station has also set up a public telephone retail store. The station is now trying to expand the original location and change it to a postal and telegraph agency. Business hours are from 8:00 to 22:00.</p>
<p>Shanghai North Station: The postal and telegraph agency at the station is located in the original telegraph room, and the location is very good. There are no restrictions on business hours. Mail on Sundays and public holidays is received and sent during post office hours.</p>
<p>Shanghai South Station: The postal and telegraph agency at the station was designed and decorated by the Road Bureau, and a telephone operator from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau was stationed at the station to work. Its business hours are from 8:00 to 24:00.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Station: The station specially vacated the original station master's office for the establishment of a postal and telegraph agency. Windows are also opened on the platform and on the ticket office to be close to the public. Business hours are roughly the same as the stations mentioned above.</p>
<p>Hangzhou City Station: The postal and telegraph agency at the station is located in the station's telegraph office, near the platform and the ticket office. There are business windows on both sides, which is extremely convenient. There are no restrictions on business hours.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate foreigners, all the postal and telegraph agencies at the above-mentioned stations have added English names on the nameplates: "Postal and Telegraph Agency" and other words, and all the equipment is very thoughtful. Business has already started today. From now on, Chinese and foreign passengers can go to the postal and telegraph agency nearby at any time if they want to send telegrams, mail letters, or talk to relatives and friends. The required postage and telegraph fees are collected according to the regulations of the postal and telegraph bureaus, and no additional fees are charged. This facility for facilitating passengers is suitable for the completion of the New Year's Day. The new year has new ideas, which can be regarded as congratulations to the future of the transportation industry.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Civil Affairs Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Yu Jingtang</p>
<p>Jingtang has been in charge of civil affairs in Jiangsu Province for more than a year and a half. As the New Year approaches, I would like to review the accomplishments of the past year and offer encouragement for future plans. I will briefly list ten aspects as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Determining the Central Work of Each County: This province has suffered severe water and drought disasters in recent years. To revitalize and eliminate the disadvantages, there are many complicated clues. After careful research, it is known that it is not enough to understand the actual needs of the local area and establish central standards to deal with the matter. In May of the 24th year, all counties were instructed to create a general outline of the central work implementation plan for the 24th year, in accordance with the accounting year, based on the needs of the people and what the financial and human resources could afford. It also clearly stipulated the "specific methods," "implementation procedures," and "work schedule," which should be submitted for approval before June 1st. The counties under the jurisdiction of the commissioners' offices should submit them through the commissioners for preliminary review, with opinions attached, for the province to consider. As of the end of September, the general outlines and review opinions submitted by the commissioners and county magistrates were distributed to various departments for review, and then reviewed and approved by this department, instructing them to implement them in order. Those not included in the 24th-year budget, inconsistent with the budget, or not urgently needed by the local area and beyond the temporary financial capacity were deleted. To facilitate performance evaluation, in August, all counties were instructed to report the progress of their work in detail according to the approved central work when submitting monthly work reports. As a result, the effectiveness of supervision by the provincial government has become more rigorous than before, and county administration facilities have standards to follow.</p>
<p>2.  Increasing County Administrative Expenses: The county government is the key to promoting all county administration. The allocation of expenses and personnel is closely related to the implementation of government orders. In recent years, the administrative affairs of each county have been busy, and the number of assistant staff has been insufficient, while the salaries have been meager, which has affected the performance of the work. Therefore, considering the actual needs of each county, the number of assistant staff has been re-determined, and the treatment has also been slightly improved. As a result, the administrative expenses of each county have slightly increased compared to the past. It is estimated that the first-class counties will increase by 116 yuan per month, the second-class counties will increase by 120 yuan per month, and the third-class counties will increase by 230 yuan per month. The proposal was approved by the Provincial Government Committee and implemented in the 24th year. With the county administrative organization strengthened, the efficiency of county administration will naturally increase accordingly.</p>
<p>3.  Implementing Baojia Education: This province decided to implement Baojia in April of the 23rd year. All 61 counties in the province, except Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County, had completed the Baojia compilation and investigation work by July of the 24th year. What needs to be continued is the implementation of Baojia education. In other words, to train the township Baojia chiefs and people under the Baojia system to understand the true meaning of Baojia, so as to receive the practical effect of the operation. The training methods for township Baojia chiefs have been formulated. The training of township chiefs is the responsibility of the administrative inspector, and the districts where no commissioners are stationed are directly handled by this department. The Baojia training is the responsibility of the county magistrates, and the Jia chief training is the responsibility of the district chiefs. A total of 8,066 township chiefs in the 61 counties have been trained separately. There are a total of 68,360 Bao in the province, and 57 counties have conducted Bao chief training, with a total of 64,007 Bao chiefs trained. There are a total of 717,786 Jia in the province, and 10 counties, including Tongshan, have conducted Jia chief training, with a total of 148,607 Jia chiefs trained. Since the separate training has been implemented, the township Baojia chiefs have a considerable understanding of the meaning of Baojia and the current laws and regulations of the government. The popularization of Baojia education is indeed beneficial to the implementation of the Baojia system.</p>
<p>4.  Applying the Baojia System: If the Baojia system can be used to the fullest, it is an important institution for promoting government orders and developing people's power. However, at the beginning of the implementation, we should not be burdened with heavy work. I am afraid that the organization of Baojia personnel at all levels is just beginning to form, and the force may not be able to reach the extensive tasks, which is difficult to be perfect. Therefore, it was proposed and passed by the Provincial Government Committee. It was decided to temporarily use (1) preventing bandits, (2) prohibiting opium and drugs, (3) requisitioning labor to dredge rivers, and (4) compulsory literacy education as the scope of Baojia application in the 24th year, and instructed all counties to comply. The rest will be considered for advancement after the foundation is consolidated. The most effective result at present is the prevention of bandits. For example, in Xuhuaihai and other places in northern Jiangsu, banditry has been rampant. Last year, when the green gauze tent was erected, the people were able to live in peace. In particular, Huaiyin District has been peaceful since the last bandit suppression, which is rare in recent years. The effect of Baojia application can be seen in this. The second is the requisition of labor to dredge rivers. The total number of laborers requisitioned by various counties in the previous year reached 400,000. It is known that the embankment to prevent the Yellow River employed tens of thousands of people, and in the battle of the West Dike of Weishan Lake, more than 100,000 workers were recruited in less than a day, and a 20-mile-long dike was built in two weeks. The rapid progress of the project shows the effectiveness of the Baojia system. In addition, the counties' handling of the reporting of ten acres of land and the investigation of opium addicts also rely on Baojia. The merit of Baojia's application is already evident.</p>
<p>5.  Organizing Public Security Expenses: The public security budget of each county has not been established for a long time, resulting in many malpractices. At the beginning of Jingtang's tenure, he regarded the reorganization of public security as an important way to stabilize society and give play to administrative efficiency. It is necessary to start with the establishment of a public security budget. Therefore, when reviewing the local budgets of each county, based on the principle of unified revenue and expenditure, and weighing the local public security situation and local financial resources, the public security expenses of each county were properly allocated and decided. The proposal was approved by the Provincial Government Committee and distributed to the counties for compliance. Since then, all public security expenses have been directly collected by the county government, and issued on a monthly basis in accordance with the approved budget. With the public security expenses determined, the long-standing abuses such as falsely collecting and actually paying, or self-raising and self-use, can be expected to be eliminated. The initial goal has been achieved. In the future, we will strive to enrich the expenses to promote the development of the cause.</p>
<p>6.  Implementing Police Education: Police personnel are responsible for performing police tasks, and they must receive police education to be competent for the job. Therefore, first, the counties were ordered to strictly distinguish and eliminate the old and weak, and set up training schools for police officers to transfer active police officers to receive training in stages. The police education plan of each county was determined. The department compiled various publications such as field work instructions and subject progress, and was responsible for ensuring that all levels of public security officials strictly comply. Later, it was seen that the establishment of police training schools in various counties was not enough in terms of manpower and financial resources, and it was inevitable that the schools were simple and crude, and the effect was not obvious. Therefore, it is planned to concentrate efforts, divide the province into several training areas, and set up district training schools to increase the efficiency of training. This is in terms of the education of existing police officers. To seek further development of the province's police administration in the future, a provincial police training school was established in the autumn of the 23rd year to recruit 200 junior high school graduates to receive police management district education, and cultivate basic police personnel who are hardworking, enduring, and both virtuous and academic. In the autumn of the 24th year, it was expanded again. In addition to continuing to run the police cadet class, a police officer class was added to recruit 100 high school graduates to receive two years of strict education. At the same time, 80 active police officers from the public security organs of various counties were assigned, and 100 graduates of police academies were recruited to set up a police officer training class to receive six months of training. Now that the name of the training school is no longer applicable, it has been renamed Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy.</p>
<p>7.  Piloting the Police Management District System: It is an indisputable theory that the police management district system is the most effective police duty system. This department previously formulated a general outline of the Jiangsu Province Pilot Police Management District System Plan for the pilot implementation of the police management district system, which was submitted to and approved by the Provincial Government Conference for implementation. This system was specified as basic training in the Provincial Police Training School. All graduating officers were assigned to Kunshan County in July of the 24th year for practical testing. The three-month trial was quite effective. Other counties, such as Jiading, Nanhui, and Yixing, have also selected sites for trial implementation, and have achieved considerable results. Now, it is being planned as a whole. Once police education is gradually popularized, this system will be promoted throughout the province to seek a thorough improvement of police practice.</p>
<p>8.  Organizing and Expanding Relief Undertakings: The relief undertakings in this province have been established for a long time, but the abuses of following the old ways are inevitably accumulated and deepened. In recent years, people's livelihood has been declining, and the number of poor and helpless people in need of relief is increasing day by day. However, the local relief agencies have followed the old habits, and the content is corrupt. Not only is active relief unable to be planned and implemented, but also passive relief needs to be improved. It is urgent to reorganize and expand the undertakings. The way to reorganize is to start from the three aspects of organization, funding, and personnel. Regarding the organizational aspect, all county relief agencies with the same nature should be instructed to consider the economic situation and the needs of the undertakings, and separately reduce the number of agencies, merge and plan to handle them in a unified manner to avoid many branches. Regarding the funding aspect, all foundation assets must be centrally managed and uniformly allocated. All expenses must be budgeted before the beginning of the year, and submitted to the department for audit to prevent waste. Administrative expenses must be reduced to the minimum to seek the maximum expansion of operating expenses. Regarding the personnel aspect, in addition to strictly distinguishing and carefully selecting the presiding personnel, they should also be assessed at any time. For each undertaking, we should strive to combine education and nurture. Even the old, weak, and disabled should be taught beneficial physical and mental education and appropriate skills, so that they can seek independence and achieve the goal of active relief. For the sake of detailed visits in advance of this reorganization, a provincial relief undertaking conference was convened in May of the 24th year to discuss it in detail. The department then formulated implementation measures and instructed them to comply. At present, the relief undertaking in this province has made progress compared with the past. However, in terms of expansion, due to the repeated disasters in this province, it is difficult to raise funds, and it has not been possible to actively carry out the undertakings in a unified manner. At present, the counties are working hard to raise funds and increase the number of homes. There are a total of eleven homes and twenty-one institutes in Lishui, Liyang, Yangzhong, Fengxian, Chuansha, Baoshan, Yixing, Siyang, Yizheng, Shuyang, and Baoyang.</p>
<p>9.  Promoting Health Undertakings: Since Chairman Chen came to Jiangsu, he has actively planned, supervised, and promoted health administration, and established a medical and political college to train medical and political personnel to prepare for the improvement of health administration. In recent years, this department has formulated organizational regulations for county hospitals to strictly determine the candidates for the director and doctors to improve the organization's content. The counties that have not established county hospitals should be instructed to follow the newly promulgated regulations and plan to establish them as soon as possible. If it is true that the funds are exhausted and they cannot be established for a while, they will be allowed to set up two departments, diagnosis and treatment and obstetrics, in the opium rehabilitation center. After several urging, the total number of hospitals added in the 24th year includes six counties: Haimen, Taicang, Kunshan, Huai'an, Dangshan, and Tongshan. There are five counties with diagnosis and treatment departments: Gaochun, Wujiang, Luhe, Xinghua, and Shuyang. At the same time, a city health experiment district was set up in Huaiyin, and a township health experiment district was set up in Jianbi, Dantu, Zhenjiang, as a preliminary step to improve health undertakings and to set an example for the province's health administration. Now that each health experiment district has been established for nearly four months, according to the summary of past work, the city experiment district has formulated temporary regulations for life statistics, and 28 regulations for banning private toilets and hotels and bath industries to improve environmental sanitation, compiled "Health Weekly" and "Health Common Sense" to introduce common health knowledge, and to give instructions on daily hygiene methods, established a health committee, held school health team training, established a mothers' association, an infant health experiment center, and started a midwife training class. The township experiment district has improved environmental sanitation, established a mothers' association, a health committee, family visits, and set up a diagnosis and treatment department. At the same time, the first graduates of the Health Administration Department of the Provincial Medical and Political College, Gu Su and others, were assigned to four counties, Kunshan, Wuxian, Wuxi, and Dangshan, as health technicians, responsible for the health guidance of each county, in order to gradually promote health administration.</p>
<p>10. Strictly Prohibiting Opium and Drugs: Since the prohibition of opium and drugs in this province was transferred to this department in September of the 24th year, it has only been four months. According to the summary of the handling process, there are about three aspects worth mentioning. One is to hold the qualification examination for the directors of the county opium rehabilitation centers. The establishment of opium rehabilitation centers is originally intended to facilitate the transmission and investment of opium addicts in opium rehabilitation and the verification of opium addiction. The selection of the directors of the centers should be strictly distinguished. Therefore, in October of the 24th year, the Jiangsu Provincial County Opium Rehabilitation Center Director Qualification Examination Committee was organized to hold a public qualification examination. A total of 56 people were to be qualified. After the qualification examination, 9 people were approved to be retained, and 5 people have been appointed. The second is to formulate measures for investigating and cracking down on opium and drugs and rewarding and punishing them. The work of investigating and cracking down on opium and drugs is of great importance to the future of the prohibition policy. Commissioners are sent to various places to take charge of the matter, and the service and reward and punishment rules for the opium and drug investigation officers are formulated and submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval and implementation to be complied with. The third is to hold a regular general registration of opium addicts and a general reporting of opium and drug criminals. In order to strictly eliminate opium and drug criminals, this department has formulated measures for the general reporting of opium and drug criminals, which will be implemented on February 1st of this year using the Baojia organization to hold the general reporting. At the same time, in order to sympathize with the criminal law and be careful in prison, measures for the self-renewal registration of opium addicts have been formulated, which will be implemented on January 1st of this year, allowing unlicensed opium addicts to apply for self-renewal registration and obtain a license. Their previous criminal behavior will be leniently exempted from prosecution.</p>
<p>The above is in terms of the most important aspects. Other matters, such as stipulating unified measures for rewarding and punishing county magistrates, organizing autonomous regions, increasing the number of experimental areas combining politics and education, handling household registration changes and reporting, reorganizing warehouses, reorganizing the provincial water police team, inspecting public security police, inspecting boats, adding patrol boats, and branding public guns, are all implemented in accordance with the predetermined measures. I am clumsy and work hard to improve. There are hundreds of things to be done, and the well is deep and the rope is short. The new year is approaching, and I respectfully present the education administration, hoping to be enlightened and to look forward to the future.</p>
<h3>One Year of Trademark Administration</h3>
<p>— He Bingxian</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Although the history of trademark administration in our country is only thirty-four years, from the absence of trademark administrative facilities to the promulgation of the Trademark Law and the establishment of the Trademark Bureau, from the Trademark Bureau legally managing trademark administration to the increase in the number of registered trademarks, even to the point where the number of Chinese registered trademarks surpasses foreign registered trademarks – these facts tell us that this period of just over thirty years has earned our country's trademark administration an important position among various administrative facilities. I, the author, have been responsible for trademark administration in our country for almost four years. In addition to handling trademark registration and disputes in accordance with the Trademark Law with a fair attitude and agile methods, I always review the trademark administration of the past year and prepare a report for the public at the beginning of each year.</p>
<p>The year 1935 (Republic Year 24) has passed amidst severe national crisis and extreme economic depression. Fortunately, the advancement of trademark administration in this year did not encounter any obstacles, and the total number of registered trademarks was the highest in four years. The number of trademark dispute cases accepted was also relatively low compared to the past four years, which can be considered a good phenomenon. Now, I will separately report on trademark registration and trademark disputes of this year. The statistics listed are mostly calculated up to November 20th due to the rush to publish, which should be stated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issue of revising the Trademark Law, which has been viewed by various sectors of society for the past two years, has finally been properly resolved. The current Trademark Law, amended by the Legislative Yuan, was promulgated by government order on November 23, 1935 (Republic Year 24). Although I feel that trademark legislation and trademark administration are different, the revision of the Trademark Law has a great impact on trademark administration. Therefore, the end of this article will briefly mention the revision of the Trademark Law.</p>
<p>Trademark Registration</p>
<p>The registration of a trademark, according to Article 27 of the Trademark Law, first undergoes preliminary examination and public announcement for six months. If no interested party raises an objection, it is then registered. Therefore, trademarks submitted to the Trademark Bureau for registration have always been divided into two types: preliminarily examined trademarks and registered trademarks. Registered trademarks are trademarks that were preliminarily examined and publicly announced six months ago. We have compiled the statistics for registered trademarks in 1935 (Republic Year 24). Due to the above relationship, according to Article 37 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trademark Law (which classifies various goods into seventy categories), the total number of registrations from various countries in 1935 can be calculated as follows: China 1914, Germany 317, Britain 274, United States 246, Japan 100, France 59, Netherlands 7, Switzerland 18, Italy 10, Norway 5, Russia 3, Czechoslovakia 2, Austria 5, Sweden 5, Philippines 3, Egypt 3, Denmark 3, Spain 3, Australia 1, Greece 4, Belgium 1, Canada 1, Estonia 1. The total for the year is 2,985, of which Chinese trademarks account for 1,914, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of registered trademarks. Among foreign registered trademarks, Germany has the most, with 317, followed by Britain, then the United States, and Japan ranks fourth. In addition, countries such as France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium have dozens, ten, or only a few registrations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the calculation of Chinese and foreign trademarks registered with the Trademark Bureau over the years, 2,300 were registered in 1928 (Republic Year 17), 6,691 in 1929 (Republic Year 18), 4,206 in 1930 (Republic Year 19), 3,850 in 1931 (Republic Year 20), 2,479 in 1932 (Republic Year 21), 2,846 in 1933 (Republic Year 22), 2,729 in 1934 (Republic Year 23), and 2,985 in 1935 (Republic Year 24), totaling 28,086 up to 1935 (Republic Year 24). Trademarks registered before 1928 (Republic Year 17) have all been included because, from 1928 (Republic Year 17) to 1931 (Republic Year 20), all previously registered trademarks have been re-registered in accordance with the National Registration Bureau Registration Regulations, Provisional Regulations for Trademark Registration Certificates, and the Provisional Measures for the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Continue Handling Trademark Cases Transferred by the Guangdong Construction Department. The reason why the number of registered trademarks was particularly high in 1929 (Republic Year 18) and 1930 (Republic Year 19) was because it included these re-registered trademarks.</p>
<p>Regarding trademarks that the Trademark Bureau did not approve for registration, there were 332 in 1935 (Republic Year 24). "Note that this number is calculated up to November 15th." Now, the statistics of trademarks rejected over the years are as follows: 367 from 1928 (Republic Year 17) to 1930 (Republic Year 19), 340 in 1931 (Republic Year 20), 232 in 1932 (Republic Year 21), 401 in 1933 (Republic Year 22), 449 in 1934 (Republic Year 23), and 332 in 1935 (Republic Year 24), totaling 2,121.</p>
<p>Trademark Disputes</p>
<p>Because the trademarks handled by the Trademark Bureau for registration are divided into registered trademarks and preliminarily examined trademarks, the trademark dispute cases that the Trademark Bureau is authorized to handle according to the Trademark Law are divided into</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>evaluation and objection cases. Objection cases are disputes against preliminarily examined trademarks, while evaluation cases are disputes against registered trademarks. This is clearly stipulated in Articles 27 and 30 of the Trademark Law. In accordance with the law, both objection cases and evaluation cases have a re-examination procedure in the Trademark Bureau. The former is called "re-examination of objections," and the latter is called "re-evaluation." The trademark dispute cases we are discussing now refer to these four types of cases: objection, re-examination of objections, evaluation, and re-evaluation.</p>
<p>Up to November 20, 1935 (Republic Year 24), the Trademark Bureau accepted a total of 150 trademark dispute cases of the four types, which can be said to be relatively few in the past four years. Now, the trademark dispute cases accepted in 1935 (Republic Year 24) can be divided into seven types based on their dispute focus: ① Disputes over the similarity of trademark designs and priority of use; ② Disputes over the similarity of trademark designs and identical names and priority of use; ③ Disputes over the identical trademark names and priority of use; ④ Disputes over whether it is a public symbol; ⑤ Disputes over the conditions that a trademark itself should possess; ⑥ Disputes over whether the trademark contains the name or trade name of another person; ⑦ Examiners requesting evaluation of invalid registration based on statutory authority. As can be seen from the above, most trademark disputes arise from the issue of similarity of trademark names and designs, while disputes arising from other issues are rare. Article 3 of the Trademark Law stipulates that "when two or more persons separately apply for registration of identical or similar trademarks, the one who actually used it first shall be granted registration." The reason why trademark disputes arising from names and designs are particularly numerous is due to this provision in the Trademark Law.</p>
<p>The above is all about the trademark dispute cases accepted. As for the trademark dispute cases resolved, in 1935 (Republic Year 24) (including cases not resolved in 1934 (Republic Year 23)), the Trademark Bureau resolved a total of 159 trademark dispute cases, which can be broadly divided into four types: Chinese against Chinese, Chinese against Foreigners, Foreigners against Chinese, and Foreigners against Foreigners.</p>
<p>The trademark dispute events that the Trademark Bureau is authorized to handle according to the Trademark Law are the above-mentioned four categories of objection, evaluation, etc. These four types of dispute cases have a specific condition, that is, the trademark of the defendant must have been preliminarily examined or registered, otherwise the Trademark Bureau cannot handle it according to the law. Disputes over trademarks that have not been submitted for registration fall within the scope of criminal law and can only be tried by the courts. However, before April 1935 (Republic Year 24), the Trademark Bureau had also issued certificates of authentication when trademarks that had not been submitted for registration were accused of imitation, certifying whether the defendant's trademark was similar to the plaintiff's registered trademark. On March 30, 1935 (Republic Year 24), the Ministry of Industry instructed the Trademark Bureau to stop issuing certificates of authentication with Industry Letter No. 33340. After receiving the order, the Trademark Bureau announced the suspension of authentication on April 17th. Since then, the Trademark Bureau has not handled direct requests from merchants for trademark authentication. However, since the Ministry of Justice issued a notice to all levels of courts in 1929 (Republic Year 18) requiring them to consult the Trademark Bureau before judging trademark lawsuits, the number of trademark cases in which courts at all levels have requested the Trademark Bureau to authenticate has been quite large over the years. There were 24 such trademark authentication cases requested by courts in 1935 (Republic Year 24). Of course, these authentication cases will continue to be handled and are not subject to the restrictions of Ministry Order No. 3334 of March 30th.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We have roughly divided the trademark administration of the past year into trademark registration and trademark disputes, and have also annotated several special terms such as preliminary examination and objection, all in order to facilitate the general public who do not fully understand the situation of trademark administration. Also, in order to quickly produce and publish the manuscript, some statistics are not calculated for a full year. The author expresses his apologies to the readers.</p>
<p>Finally, what should be mentioned is the revision of the Trademark Law, which has a very close relationship with future trademark administration. When we discuss the trademark administration of the past year, we cannot ignore the issue of revising the Trademark Law that was resolved in this year.</p>
<p>The motivation for revising the current Trademark Law arose two years ago. Throughout 1934 (Republic Year 23), domestic industrial and commercial circles and trademark administrative agencies were separately discussing the issue of revising the Trademark Law. At the end of that year, the Trademark Bureau submitted the draft amendment, which had been discussed and drafted for four months, to the Ministry of Industry. In the first half of 1935 (Republic Year 24), major newspapers in Shanghai continuously published articles on revising the Trademark Law. At the end of April, the 210th meeting of the Executive Yuan passed the draft amendment to the Trademark Law and sent it to the Legislative Yuan. Following this, the Legislative Yuan handed the draft to the Commercial Law Committee for review. The committee held several meetings on October 3rd and 17th to review the draft amendment to the Trademark Law, and I, the author, was also invited to attend. On October 8th, I also met with Mr. Ma Yinchu, the chairman of the committee, at Jiaotong University in Shanghai to exchange views on the revision of the Trademark Law. The issues were concentrated on: ① The removal of Article 4 of the Trademark Law; ② The so-called "actual use" in Article 3 of the Trademark Law should be restricted to "within the territory of China" and "without interruption"; ③ Adding the clause "The text used in a trademark, including pronunciation, shall be based on the national pronunciation" to Article 1 of the Trademark Law; ④ Adding the word "design" to Article 14 of the Trademark Law without adding the words "original"; ⑤ Adding a provision to Article 27 of the Trademark Law to crack down on the unauthorized alteration or addition of remarks to preliminarily examined trademarks, etc. At that time, our opinions were very close. On October 31st, the 36th meeting of the Legislative Yuan passed the amendment to the Trademark Law; on November 23rd, the National Government promulgated the amended Trademark Law by order; on November 25th, the Nanjing Central Daily News published the full text of the amended Trademark Law, the main points of which are as follows: ① Article 1 of the old law adds the designation of name and text, including pronunciation; ② Article 3 adds the restriction "within the territory of China and without interruption" regarding the actual use of the trademark; ③ The entire Article 4 is removed; ④ The third sentence of Article 14 (which becomes Article 13 due to the removal of Article 4) is changed to "The exclusive right to use a trademark is limited to the design approved for registration and the designated goods"; ⑤ In Article 18 (Article 17 in the amended law), the last sentence "mortgage" is changed to "the object of pledge"; ⑥ Article 27 (Article 26 in the amended law) adds a provision that the Trademark Bureau may revoke a preliminarily examined trademark that has been altered or added with remarks in order to insinuate; ⑦ Article 28 (Article 27 in the amended law) adds a provision that dissatisfaction with the disposition stipulated in the added provision of the preceding article may be appealed; ⑧ In Article 41 (Article 39 in the amended law), the words "Ministry of Industry and Commerce" are changed to "Ministry of Industry". In summary, the amended Trademark Law has one less article, three more items, four more words, and three changed words compared to the original Trademark Law. There is no major difference from the draft amendment, and it is believed that it will meet the expectations of all parties.</p>
<p>Although the amended Trademark Law has been promulgated by government order, its implementation still depends on the revision of the Implementing Regulations of the Trademark Law. At the time of drafting, the Trademark Bureau was still carefully studying the draft revision of the Implementing Regulations. In the future, after the Ministry of Industry officially revises and publishes it, it will definitely be implemented on the same day as the amended Trademark Law, but that is a matter after 1935 (Republic Year 24).</p>
<p>New Year's Day, 1936 (Republic Year 25), in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Message to the Citizens on New Year's Day, 1936 (Republic Year 25)</h3>
<p>I, Tiecheng, have been in charge of this city for four years. Regarding the city's policies in the past, I have always presented a statement at the beginning of each year. Now, on this New Year's Day of 1936 (Republic Year 25), as the curtain rises, looking back on the past and planning for the future, I am deeply grateful and motivated to fulfill my responsibilities. Therefore, I take this opportunity to express my sincerity again, both to encourage myself and to encourage everyone.</p>
<p>The past four years can be said to be the most difficult time since the establishment of this city. I, Tiecheng, have been struggling and encouraging myself, adapting to the times and the local conditions. All the reforms and tasks are numerous and complex. I deeply rely on the assistance of local talents, the cooperation of all citizens, and the cooperation of my colleagues in various bureaus and offices of the municipal government. Therefore, even in the midst of local turmoil and financial exhaustion, we have been able to make some progress, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>In terms of time, the first year was the year of war zone reconstruction. The focus of work in that year was to restore order, stabilize the people's hearts, and provide relief to the disaster victims and reconstruct the war zone. The second year was the year of construction of the city center. At that time, the city gradually recovered its vitality, so we followed the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and resolutely sought the gradual development of the city center. The third year was the year of cultural construction. The working policy of that year was still based on the purpose of active construction, and we strived to build various cultural undertakings in order. The fourth year was the year of social construction. In addition to continuing to construct the city center, we also devoted ourselves to promoting social welfare undertakings and realizing compulsory literacy education. Although stable-minded people, deeply concerned about the city's difficult environment and financial difficulties, suggested maintaining the status quo, I, Tiecheng, did not overestimate my abilities, overcame all opposition, and resolutely engaged in the creation of various new policies and businesses. Because this city suffered after the war, with scars all over its face, extraordinary construction is necessary to restore its inherent vitality. Moreover, due to the importance of this city's position, its revival and development are closely related to the great cause of national revival and national construction. Therefore, since taking office, I have never dared to be perfunctory or neglect my duties for a single day. Although my ability is insufficient and there may be shortcomings, I am always thinking about the revival and construction of this city.</p>
<p>This is a general explanation of the longitudinal process of time. If we further analyze the types of horizontal businesses in a concrete way, this requires a special report, but a brief explanation can also be given:</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the reconstruction of the war zone - After the January 28 Incident, the area north of Shanghai was almost reduced to ashes. After this unprecedented disaster, various reconstruction projects were immediately started. For example, the roads and ditches in the Wusong and Jiangwan districts, as well as the Baoshan Road, Hongdian Road, Baoxing Road, Baochang Road, Qiujiang Road, etc. in the Zhabei district, as well as the repair of other bridges, embankments, and transportation arteries, cost a lot. And the cleaning up of the ruins and the relief of the disaster victims are not included.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding public works - The construction of public works in the past four years has been particularly difficult. Combining roads, bridges, water conservancy, pond work, and various public buildings, the cost is nearly 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding public utilities - In addition to the progress of water supply and the development of transportation, the use of the area south of Shanghai has become more convenient since the improvement and addition of docks, and the number of berths has increased daily. Large ships with a draft of 14 feet and a length of 300 feet can be berthed. This is beneficial to the development of the southern city.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding hygiene - I, Tiecheng, was aware of the weakness of the citizens' physiques, so I paid attention to hygiene construction. In the past four years, in addition to working hard on disinfection and epidemic prevention in the war zone, I have also made unremitting efforts to build hospitals, clinics, drug rehabilitation centers, hygiene laboratories, and hygiene offices. The total cost, in addition to the regular expenses of 1.36 million yuan, all the construction equipment, drug rehabilitation medicine, etc., should also be in the range of 1.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>5.  Regarding education - The educational construction of this city can be divided into two aspects. One is educational transformation, which aims to transform the academic style, revitalize the morale, and increase the national productive capacity. The funds were designated last year, and a school construction committee was organized to be responsible for the implementation. The second is the popularization of education. The Literacy Education Committee is currently working hard to promote the compulsory literacy education movement, which has already been seen by the citizens.</p>
<p>6.  Regarding culture - Shanghai is the cultural center of the country and a world-renowned metropolis. However, important public buildings such as libraries, museums, and sports fields are still lacking, which is not enough to give citizens the comfort of physical and mental cultivation. The municipal government is aware of this, so it resolutely engaged in construction in the autumn of financial shortage. It is also enough to make people from all countries who come to visit this city recognize our nation's ability and spirit to create culture.</p>
<p>7.  Regarding society - Social construction is the main task of 1935 (Republic Year 24), among which the construction of people's new villages is its characteristic. Modern cities in various countries only strive for the abnormal development of materials, and generally fail to take into account the lives of ordinary people. Reciting the teachings of Sun Yat-sen's nation-building, the people's livelihood is the most important. Therefore, in the course of the Great Shanghai Plan construction, we should pay special attention to this. Since the design last year, the construction in various places has been completed as scheduled, and a People's Welfare Undertakings Committee has been specially set up to preside over it. It is hoped that the lives of ordinary people in this city can be improved in terms of material, spiritual, intellectual, and ability, and the main points of the New Life Movement are also planned to be thoroughly implemented in this new village environment.</p>
<p>In addition to the above items, the construction and expansion of Hongqiao Airport and Longhua Aviation Port, the addition of the Municipal Security Office, the improvement and rectification of public security administration, the planned development of the city center, and the early establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council. All these things, or they are beneficial to transportation, or they are helpful to municipal administration, or they are to ensure the security of this city, or they are to seek cooperation with local talents. In the past four years, we have been actively planning them. Although this has led to a sharp increase in expenditure and financial exhaustion, we still strive to make contributions to seek thorough implementation.</p>
<p>However, the area of this city is vast. Not only is the realization of the Great Shanghai Plan a huge task, but also the importance of its position in shielding the capital and connecting the north and south, and its close relationship with the central government, exceeds that of ordinary cities. At the beginning of the year, continuing the past and opening up the future, how will we plan to bear this important mission and start the work of this year? Regarding this level, in addition to instructing each bureau and office to separately formulate detailed, professional, concrete, and feasible plans for their respective competent businesses, the following are the key points to be mentioned:</p>
<p>1. Actively build senior and junior vocational schools for agriculture, industry, and commerce in this city.</p>
<p>2. Actively build one well-equipped boys' middle school and one girls' middle school in the city center.</p>
<p>3. In areas such as Gaohang, Zhenru, Luhang, and Caojing, actively open four agricultural school farms according to the needs of the environment, so as to devote themselves to the improvement of agricultural affairs and the experiment of collective agricultural farms.</p>
<p>4. The municipal library and museum are actively preparing and confirming the permanent funding for the official opening.</p>
<p>5. Plan to open the municipal hospital and hygiene laboratory.</p>
<p>6. Add hygiene offices.</p>
<p>7. Improve environmental hygiene.</p>
<p>8. Implement occupational hygiene.</p>
<p>9. Improve the lives of rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>10. Build public auditoriums in the southern city and Zhabei.</p>
<p>11. Build a crematorium.</p>
<p>12. Actively open the Pudong water plant.</p>
<p>13. Depending on the financial situation, plan to build a tram around the city.</p>
<p>14. Depending on the financial capacity, continue to repair the east and west sea dikes.</p>
<p>15. Prepare to hold a national domestic products exhibition to promote domestic goods and promote the prosperity of the urban area.</p>
<p>16. Plan to build the Pudong Bridge to save the current abnormal development of Shanghai and to promote the balanced development and prosperity of the southern city and Pudong.</p>
<p>In short, the characteristics of Shanghai's municipal administration in the past four years have been revival and construction, and the trend of future work should still be based on the consistent purpose of previous years, as well as the principle of simultaneously implementing education, nurture, and hygiene, establish a concrete plan, and continue to seek accelerated progress. We must make the future of this city an ideal city that is perfect in spirit and material. In particular, it is hoped that in the process of the entire national revival and national construction, it can be a powerful unit and can bear its arduous mission. This is what I, Tiecheng, encourage myself, and I also hope that all citizens will give their assistance. New Year's Day, 1936 (Republic Year 25)</p>

<h3>New Year's Greetings</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The year has changed and the atmosphere is new. The days and months of 1935 (Republic Year 24) have been declared settled, and the dawn of 1936 (Republic Year 25) is shining on our eyes with its new functions. All that we see is vibrant. The source of hope that has been on the verge of extinction can now be rekindled to encourage the sinking mind. In the common people's calculations, it seems that all the ominous events can be washed away with the passing year, and the turning point of future vitality can be expected to revive all things. However, it is difficult to avoid the triviality and even the ridiculousness of empty hopes and good wishes. It is necessary to make a comprehensive consideration and find a basis for self-improvement as the beginning of all renewal, and to use the past to guide the present, to avoid empty talk and to focus on practical actions. Then today is a great opportunity to change direction.</p>
<p>National affairs have become extremely chaotic to this day. Externally, invasions have been repeated. Internally, disasters and famines have been related to each other. Only the united efforts of the whole country can save the situation. The past facts have shown that the people of the country have not been able to unify their steps. Some criticize and denounce others, some watch the fire from the other side of the river, and some take the opportunity to enrich their own pockets, or retreat into the mountains to avoid responsibilities. They do not realize that under a collapsing nest, there is no perfect egg. If the beams are broken, how can the person who takes shelter be spared? Whether it is actively doing evil or passively staying out of the matter, the loss is the same. From now on, people should take responsibility and stand firm, not be different, not fight internally, not take advantage of the crisis, not take the opportunity to retaliate, remove the timid mentality, recognize the boundary between public and private, restrain the lazy nature, develop the habit of frugality, and use the spirit of hard work as a firm and unyielding struggle to jointly seek the maintenance of the national lifeline.</p>
<p>The grand plan of saving the country is not easy to formulate. If it is not presumptuous to talk about the high-level theories, then the above may still be the key points of saving the country. If everyone can start from themselves, think about the country in everything, avoid the propaganda smoke, focus on practical work, and gather the efforts of each position to meet the extensive needs of the times, then unity and stability can be expected. It has never been heard that a united and healthy country can be easily overthrown, nor has it been heard that a determined and hardworking people cannot create a healthy country. I dare to reveal this meaning as a New Year's greeting. From today onwards, I am willing to encourage myself with people from all over the country.</p>

<h3>US and Mexican Finance Ministers Confer on Silver Issues; London Silver Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Washington - Mexican Treasury Official Su Leishi will hold several meetings this week with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Senate silver advocates to understand the US silver purchase policy. It is reported that the Mexican people are quite agitated due to the recent sharp drop in silver prices. It is expected that the Mexican authorities will propose to the US Treasury that the US Treasury Department purchase Mexican silver at domestic purchase prices, and Mexico will offer certain concessions on tax rates as compensation. However, it is doubtful whether the US Treasury Department will agree to this proposal. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declined to comment to reporters today on the events to be discussed between the US and Mexico. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London - The silver market suddenly experienced a significant rise today. According to financial circles, the recent declaration by the US Treasury Department is one of the reasons for the rebound in silver prices. In addition, the organization of silver syndicates, the absorption of forward silver, and the cessation of sales by large accounts can all make the silver market more firm. The Bombay silver market, recently threatened by speculators, has calmed down. At the same time, the Far East has resumed purchasing silver, and short sellers everywhere have been actively covering. Some people here believe that the measures taken in London and Bombay are sufficient to prevent the silver market from being completely controlled by the US Treasury Department and are satisfactory. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>Mussolini Announces That the Northern Front Will Be Attacked Again Immediately</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Coordinating 100,000 Troops; The Emperor of Abyssinia Reveals Atrocities by Italian Troops</p>
<p>Rome - Mussolini said at a cabinet meeting today that once the areas occupied by Italian troops on the northern front have been consolidated, the northern front campaign will resume. Organizing the transportation of hundreds of thousands of troops is an extremely difficult task, and the Italian army's advance must be slow. The public should remain calm. Judging from Mussolini's words, it is clear that the Italian army will soon launch a new offensive on the entire northern front and seek a solution by force. The semi-official Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia today published an article by Gaeta, which rejected the notion that the Italian army's advance has been temporarily halted due to European events or Abyssinian resistance, saying that the offensive is still on the Italian side. It seems that after nearly three months of fighting, the Italian army has decided to advance and achieve a solution by force. However, when reporting on the latest developments in the international situation to the cabinet, Mussolini solemnly declared that Italy was not responsible for the failure of the peace plan recently proposed by the French and British governments because the plan had been rejected before it could be discussed by the Fascist Grand Council. However, the plan was far from Italy's minimum requirements, especially regarding border security and the safety of the people. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Geneva - The Emperor of Abyssinia recently telegraphed League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, revealing atrocities committed by Italian troops, stating: "The customs and laws of war have been trampled upon by Italian troops, as repeatedly reported to the League of Nations by my government. Recently, as Italian troops retreated from Shire and Tambien in the north, they set fire to the churches in those areas and massacred local civilians. Furthermore, on the 23rd of this month, they attacked Abyssinian troops with poison gas and asphyxiating gas in the Taggaze River valley. All of these actions are extremely inhumane, and I protest them again in the strongest terms, requesting that you take note." (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>A Situation of Both War and Negotiation</h3>

<p>Addis Ababa - Private sources here reported today that the Abyssinian army is approaching Magal.

<p>Djibouti - It has been learned today that anti-Emperor riots and revolutions have occurred in the Gojjam province, due to the rumor that Hailu, the Emperor's enemy and former ruler of Gojjam province, who had been detained by the Emperor for nine years, has now been poisoned by the Emperor. Therefore, the rebellion. However, officials in Addis Ababa firmly claim that this rumor is "Italian propaganda." It is generally believed here that if a revolution occurs in Gojjam province, it may have a serious impact on Abyssinia's military operations, as if Abyssinia has to withdraw troops to suppress the rebels, the resistance against Italy, which has had some success in recent days, will be reduced. (National dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Since the start of the war, European countries have sent medical teams to Abyssinia to treat wounded soldiers.

In addition, a Finnish team is about to arrive. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome - It is generally believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement that the Anglo-French peace plan could not meet Italy's minimum requirements, and that the League of Nations was unwilling to go beyond the scope of the Paris proposals, means that future proposals may not be as lenient to Italy. As for Mussolini's claim that Italian troops had advanced 170 kilometers from the former border, military experts said that unless Mussolini had a specially made map, he must have used a rubber ruler. (National dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris - French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval declared today that his foreign policy would temporarily not mediate the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but would cooperate on the oil embargo issue, but would not promote it. In general, he would follow traditional French policy: 1. Maintaining the League of Nations Charter as the linchpin of French international law. 2. Strengthening national defense by utilizing collective security treaties within the scope of the League of Nations. and 3. Viewing Anglo-French cooperation as an essential component of European security. Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian conflict, Laval's policy will be one of passive expectation, meaning that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the Abyssinian Emperor must first take steps towards peace. At the same time, Laval hopes that Mussolini will soon reopen negotiations by consulting with the signatory countries of the treaty, as the Italian military conquest of Abyssinia has slowed somewhat, and the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy are gradually taking effect. Currently, Italy's foreign exchange problem is becoming increasingly serious, and if Mussolini cannot borrow the funds needed, he will have to reduce military spending. (National dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London - The Daily Express recently reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reported at a cabinet meeting yesterday that the country had signed a financial agreement with Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Belgium.

The newspaper also said that regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, it is expected that one of "Europe's smallest countries" will propose peace terms to Italy based on the recent peace plan proposed by the United Kingdom and France, and that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will accept it before the Abyssinian rainy season. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Rome - Twenty-two domestic trade groups are scheduled to hold a conference on February 29th to comprehensively discuss Italy's economic situation since the implementation of sanctions by various countries. The nature of the conference is extremely important. It has been more than a month since the implementation of sanctions, and Italy has done its best to resist. Its economic achievements are quite remarkable. For example, food, which was originally in short supply, has been banned from consumption twice a week by order of the government, and its consumption has been greatly reduced compared to the past. In addition, for mineral products, especially metals, the government is determined to reduce their imports. For example, copper, which is not produced in Italy, will be replaced by domestic aluminum.

<h3>Relations between England, France, and Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin: When French Premier Laval explained his foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, he touched upon the relations between France and Germany, saying, "If France and Germany cannot cooperate with each other, then European peace cannot be guaranteed for a single day." Local political figures have commented on this, saying that if the mutual assistance agreement between France and Russia is ratified by the French Parliament, then there is no possibility of a real improvement in relations between France and Germany. The government newspaper, "Political and Diplomatic Correspondence," stated, "We do not doubt Laval's sincerity, but we fear that good intentions without appropriate actions to support them will not be enough. The mutual assistance agreements signed by France and Russia, as well as by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, are all aimed at Germany, which has caused great apprehension. Even after Laval's speech, this anxiety has not been dispelled. The Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement contradicts the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and also designates Germany as an aggressor in advance. Although efforts have been made to achieve international compromise in various aspects, this is not an encouraging sign. True cooperation can only be realized in an environment of mutual trust." (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris: According to a foreign affairs reporter for the Business Daily, British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk, visited Premier and Foreign Minister Laval yesterday afternoon. It is reported that the two discussed the recent meeting between British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, and German Chancellor Hitler, as well as the return to London tomorrow of the newly appointed British Foreign Secretary Eden from Yorkshire to take office. In addition, they also discussed issues in the naval conference. Recently, French Naval Minister Piétri declared that France was unwilling to maintain the ratio system stipulated by the Washington Treaty. When Britain heard this, it felt uneasy, as it showed that France and Japan held similar views. The British also believe that France's insistence on maintaining a ratio of 100 to 35 between British and German naval tonnage, while at the same time opposing the ratio system, is clearly self-contradictory. What Ambassador Clerk discussed with Premier Laval yesterday was probably this. (31st, Havas)</p>
<p>London: It is generally believed that British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, visited German State Secretary Bülow yesterday and discussed the relations between Germany and Lithuania. The government of the Memel region of Lithuania is led by the German Party, and many Lithuanian officials have been dismissed. German propaganda organs have also exerted much pressure on the government. It is generally feared here that Lithuanian public opinion will therefore lean towards the Soviet Union and advocate joining the Soviet Union, and that mediation is urgently needed. There are also various outstanding issues between Germany and Lithuania, such as the exchange of political prisoners. Germany is unwilling to accept certain political prisoners whose nationality is German, which is also a point of contention. The British Ambassador paid particular attention to this aspect during his meeting with German State Secretary Bülow. (30th, Havas)</p>
<h3>The Resignation of Tardiou</h3>
<p>Paris: French diplomat and politician Tardieu recently resigned from the Republican Center Party in response to the speech given by former member Renard in the Chamber of Deputies on December 27, criticizing Premier Laval's foreign policy, which he disagreed with. He stated in his letter of resignation yesterday that the position on sanctions is currently quite disordered, and the responsibility lies with Britain, because in 1924 and 1932, when France twice proposed the organization of sanctions, it was Britain that hindered them. Today, at the request of the Central Party, Mr. Tardieu has withdrawn his resignation, but whether he will accept the position of party chairman is still under consideration and will be decided later. It is noted that the party chairman is Mr. Renard, who has now resigned. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris: The current Minister of Agriculture and former Premier Tardieu resigned from the Central Republican Party today because the party demanded that France take strong action against Italy. This party was organized by Mr. Tardieu and established in 1932, at a time when many members of the Left-Wing Republican Party could not abide by party rules and voted against the Herriot government, hence this organization. (30th, National Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Plans to Actively Develop the Economy of North China</h3>
<p>Annual increase in cultural project funds to 7 million, seeking practical cooperation between China and Japan in industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities, in order to expand cultural work in China, have decided to amend the Special Accounting Law for Cultural Projects in China, increasing the annual budget of 6 million yuan by 1 million yuan to 7 million yuan, in order to establish a plan to assist the revitalization of rural areas in North China. They will request approval from the Diet next spring. The basic policy of this plan is to provide technical and economic assistance to China by Japan, to revitalize the rural areas of North China, and at the same time to realize the cooperation between "industrial Japan" and "agricultural China". In particular, they will devote their full efforts to the cultivation of cotton and the increase in wool production. The wire also stated that the specific details of expanding cultural projects in China were determined by Mr. Lin, the first section chief of the China Cultural Project Department, after investigating North China for more than four months. Liaison with the investigation team of the stationed army has also been completed. Therefore, after technical contact with the authorities of the rural areas in North China and after passing the Diet, it will be implemented from April of next year. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly revitalize the rural areas of North China, new agricultural experiment stations will be established in several places in North China, and agricultural instructors will be sent to Tianjin and other places to guide specific strategies for revitalization.</p>
<p>In order to ensure reliable sales channels for agricultural products, cotton, wool, etc., which can be reliably consumed in Japan, will be the main products, and efforts will be made to improve varieties, standardize, and permanently develop them. In order to alleviate insecurity in life, production will be shifted from single-product to multi-product, and livestock industry and handicrafts will be started. The Tianjin Sino-Japanese Academy of the East Asian Common Culture Society will be expanded to include an agricultural department to strive to inspire the knowledge of backbone members among rural children. The organization of rural cooperatives will be encouraged, and common facilities for production, sales, finance, and consumption will be established. (31st, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Publishes Article Refuting Shigemitsu's Remarks</h3>
<p>Japan's lack of sincerity in concluding a non-aggression pact has caused the Far Eastern situation. Japan should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet government gazette, Izvestia, commented on the speech by Shigemitsu Aoi, head of the Japanese Brain Trust Committee, on the international situation and China. When Shigemitsu Aoi mentioned the non-aggression pact, he expressed uncertainty. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet government proposed to Japan the conclusion of a non-aggression pact four years ago, which was subsequently shelved indefinitely. In other words, the Japanese government did not accept this proposal. As for Shigemitsu Aoi's so-called "both sides lack sincerity in concluding the pact," it is absolutely wrong. Although Japan is unwilling to conclude it, the Soviet side was fully prepared to conclude it as early as four years ago, and we have no need to propose it to Japan. The Soviet government made this proposal precisely to realize its peaceful policy. The Soviet Union adheres to this policy without wavering, so everyone knows that the Soviet government is still willing to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan, because Japan is the only country among the Soviet Union's neighbors that has not concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. The Japanese people are extremely concerned about world peace, especially Far Eastern peace, because only peace is beneficial to them. Therefore, if the facts are as Shigemitsu Aoi claims, that the government is unwilling to conclude the pact, then Japan should bear full responsibility for the Far Eastern situation caused by this. There is no sign of this situation improving, because according to London Telegraph, Japan is extremely willing to conclude a military pact with Germany to jointly oppose the Soviet Union and Britain.

<p>Moscow: An epidemic is raging near Hailar, adjacent to the Soviet border in Manchuria. For the sake of hygiene, the Soviet government has decided to temporarily seal the Soviet-Manchurian border along the Heilongjiang River, from Kumelbashi to Hailar. (31st, TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow: Authorities announced today that the border between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" between Kuma and Bashukov on the Amur River has been temporarily closed, and passage through Hailar has also been suspended.

He arrived in Yokohama yesterday on his way home and gave a speech saying that since departing last August, he has inspected various countries in Europe. This is his first decision to come to Japan.

Regarding the issue of fortifying the Aleutian Islands after the failure of the London Naval Conference, McSwain said that the scope of the Wilcox Bill is so broad that it is possible to open up an air force base there. The Army and Navy attach great importance to consolidating the bases in Hawaii and Alaska. It is now proposed to organize junior air force volunteer teams from university students to create various well-trained aviation personnel, so that 20,000 military pilots can be provided to the country in the event of an emergency.

<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Relations Undecided</h3>

The main points are as follows: Egypt is independent and joins the League of Nations as a member state. Foreign nationals and their interests within the territory are fully protected by the Egyptian government. British troops withdraw to within the Suez Canal Zone. The two countries conclude a treaty in which Britain is responsible for defending Egypt. Because the Egyptian side refused to accept it, this agreement was never concluded. Recently, after the King of Egypt issued an edict restoring the 1923 constitution, Nahas wrote to British High Commissioner Lampson, stating that he was willing to accept the previous agreement in order to implement it. However, since the letter was sent, no formal response has been received from the British government. Therefore, at this moment, the "National Front" and public opinion are waiting. Today, Prime Minister Nasim met with Sir Lampson, and what they discussed was this issue. At present, although Cairo University has opened its doors, students are still on strike and have put forward two demands as conditions for resuming classes: 1. The government grants amnesty to political prisoners; 2. Britain quickly gives a satisfactory response to the demands made by the "National Front." (31st, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Uruguay Severs Diplomatic Relations with Russia; Russia Lodges Second Protest</h3>
<p>Demands explanation of accusations</p>
<p>Capital of Uruguay: The government previously severed diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, stating that the Communist Party had a central headquarters in Uruguay that specialized in inciting unrest in South American countries. The document accused the Soviet Russian embassy here of providing funds to the Brazilian rebel party. Soviet Russian Minister Minkin immediately sent a note to Foreign Minister Espalter, strongly defending himself, but the Foreign Minister did not accept it and returned the original note. Recently, Minkin submitted a second protest to the Foreign Minister, demanding a clear explanation of the points in the severance order accusing Soviet Russia. (30th, Havas Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Spain: New Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>Madrid: Only eight hours after the resignation of the cabinet formed by former Liberal Party leader Valladares on the 16th, Valladares formed a new cabinet tonight, mostly composed of members of the Central Independent Party. (30th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid: Premier Valladares tendered his resignation to President Zamora yesterday because the cabinet had differing opinions on the issue of elections in the Chamber of Deputies. The President still entrusted Valladares with the task of forming a new cabinet, which has now been completed. The list of candidates is as follows:</p>
<p>Premier and Minister of State Valladares; Army General Millero (reappointed); Navy Rear Admiral Achárola (new appointment); Justice and Labor Pesquera (former Minister of Education); Education Villalobos (new appointment); Transport and Public Works Del Rio (reappointed); Agriculture, Commerce, Industry and Finance Mendizábal (new appointment); Foreign Affairs Aveiro (former Minister of Interior).</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of the new Valladares cabinet is that, apart from Del Rio, who belongs to the Progressive Party (which occupies only three seats in the Chamber of Deputies), all other cabinet members are non-parliamentarians. The ministers of the Army and Navy are experts. Premier Valladares himself and Foreign Minister Aveiro belong to the non-partisan faction. As for Pesquera and Mendizábal, they were originally members of the Radical Party and were expelled from the party on the 14th of this month when Valladares first formed his cabinet.

<h3>The Lindberghs Arrive in Liverpool Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liverpool: The American consulate here announced today that the famous American aviator Charles Lindbergh, his wife, and their child are expected to arrive at the port at 5:00 AM tomorrow and disembark at 6:30 AM. A news agency has prepared a high-speed car to follow Lindbergh in case he tries to avoid reporters. The attention of the press to Lindbergh's visit to England is evident. (30th, National Press)</p>
<p>Liverpool: The American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his family arrived in England on the "American Importer" ship, which arrived at Gladstone Pier in this port at 11:15 AM this morning. The police authorities had previously announced that no loiterers were allowed near the area where Lindbergh disembarked. When the ship arrived, it was raining, but crowds braved the rain and gathered near the pier, eager to see Lindbergh's appearance. At that time, only Lindbergh's friends and a few journalists were able to enter and greet Lindbergh. Most of the other journalists had been waiting all night and had planned how to approach Lindbergh in order to inquire about the reason for his visit to England. When Lindbergh landed, he was seen to be tall and handsome, and his wife, holding her young son, followed closely behind. But after only a few steps, the two jumped into a car and sped away. At that time, the journalists were still unable to approach Lindbergh. Lindbergh's car was followed by a police car for protection. No one knew where they were going. As of now, no journalist has been able to find out where this "aviation prodigy" is staying. His mysterious movements are evident from this. (31st, Havas)</p>
<h3>Famous British Politician Lord Reading Dies</h3>
<p>London: Lord Reading, a famous British politician and legal expert, caught a cold last week and died of heart failure at his London residence last night at the age of 75. His father was a businessman, so he studied commerce in his youth, but he felt that it was not his passion and changed to study navigation. He sailed to India with a ship, and then changed his career to become a broker on the stock exchange, with a special talent for finance, but his business was sluggish, so he changed his plans and studied law. When he became a lawyer in 1887, he was already 27 years old. He was well-known for handling lawsuits, and he was particularly adept at handling property cases. He entered politics in 1904 and was elected as a member of the House of Commons. In 1910, he was appointed Attorney General and joined the Asquith cabinet. Because of his financial skills, he was appointed as the leader of the Anglo-French Loan Commission. In 1917, he was appointed as a special envoy to the United States and was officially appointed as the British Ambassador to the United States that year. After the end of the World War, he resigned as ambassador and returned to his country to serve as Minister of Justice. In 1921, he was appointed as Governor-General of India. He handled his duties with diligence and was praised. It was thanks to his efforts that the various political parties of the Indian Parliament were able to establish friendly relations, and the trend of non-cooperation eventually subsided. Reading participated in the three sessions of the Indian Round Table Conference as a representative of the Liberal Party and played a significant role in mediation. When the first National Government was established, Reading served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. (31st, Reuters)</p>

The regulations stipulate that: 1. Those who commit crimes in the capital; 2. Those who are decided to be sent in by the Central Party Headquarters; 3. Those who commit crimes in provinces where the Reflection Institute has not been established; 4. Those who commit crimes in provinces where the Reflection Institute has been established, but have special circumstances, should all be sent to the Capital Reflection Institute for reform. At present, due to insufficient funds, the temporary capacity is set at 300 people. More than 20 people have been sent from Beiping and other places. It is reported that after its establishment, the regular expenses will be 7,000 yuan per month, which is feared to be insufficient. The location of the Institute is selected near Xiaozhuang, and more than 180 acres of land will be requisitioned. The construction cost is approved at 150,000 yuan.

<h3>Foreign Embassies in Beijing Make Preliminary Announcements for Building Sites</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The construction sites for foreign embassies in Beijing have been designated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Government, and the Capital Construction Committee. Each embassy is limited to a maximum of 20 mu. According to this division, there are 21 sites available for building embassies. After drawing and consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government, it was agreed. Later, because the foreign embassies did not inquire for a long time, and the situation changed, only seven sites were available for use. Among them, two sites already have buildings. In fact, there are only five sites that can be used as options for building embassies. The United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany have successively inspected them, but they all feel that there are not enough to be allocated. Therefore, the Executive Yuan presented a request to the National Government for approval to moderately relax the number of times, but the maximum limit should not exceed 80 mu. It is reported that the British Embassy has notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the site of the Xizhu Lin east and west sections inspected is still satisfactory, but it is considered to be slightly low-lying, and the cost of filling the soil is very high.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Jinpu Railway Bureau: We have read the special dispatches from Beiping and Xuzhou on December 31st in today's Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) newspapers, stating that a north-bound joint transportation freight train derailed and overturned near Zhuanhe, causing damage to the locomotive and other vehicles, as well as injuries to several workers and passengers, resulting in a delay of over five hours on the Shanghai-Beiping through train. These reports are inconsistent with the facts. According to this Bureau's decision (No. 402), a northbound joint transportation freight train, while traveling near Zhuanhe, south of Cangzhou, on the night of the 29th of this month, experienced a broken spring in one of the freight cars, causing the rear wheel of that car to derail. However, the front half of the car remained upright on the tracks and did not overturn. The locomotive was not affected in any way. Workers were dispatched to rerail the car, and operations resumed. While the through train from Shanghai to Beiping was slightly delayed that day, no workers or passengers were injured because the affected train was a freight train. We have always admired your newspaper's support of transportation and request that you promptly clarify the situation to uphold public trust. Best regards, Jinpu Railway Administration.</p>
<h3>Numerous Poor People in Ganzhou; Four Soup Kitchens in Nanchang Serving 18,000 People</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi has suffered from banditry for over nine years, compounded by natural and man-made disasters, resulting in economic collapse and social disruption. The people's livelihoods are difficult, and during this cold winter, countless people are without clothing or food, enduring hunger and cold. In addition to actively managing the work relief in the flood-stricken areas of northern Jiangxi and distributing winter grain and clothing in the severely affected areas, the Provincial Relief Committee has established four soup kitchens in Nanchang, located in the east, west, south, and north of the city. All four kitchens simultaneously began serving congee on December 26th of the lunar calendar. Poor people from all directions, supporting the old and leading the young, flocked to the kitchens like ants to honey. Among them were individuals in their seventies and eighties who also relied on the congee. Some consumed as many as five or six bowls. Although there were no side dishes, they ate as if it were a delicacy. In the early morning, members of the Relief Committee went to each kitchen to inspect. Thanks to the effective maintenance of order by the police, the situation was relatively well-managed. Statistics for that day showed that 18,000 people received food at the four kitchens. There were still those who had not arrived from distant places, and the number is expected to increase daily. The large number of poor people in Ganzhou reflects the broken rural economy. (December 27th)</p>
<p>Taixian: Ministry Corrects Additional Levies for Guiding the Huai River</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the counties under the jurisdiction of the Huai River to collect a small labor compensation on per-mu or per-tax basis for Guiding Huai river. Huang Tong of Taixian further submitted it to the Ministry of Finance on July 17th of the 24th year. In short, this compensation is identical to the expense on guiding Huai collected on per-mu basis in Huai’an, it is an additional tax on the land, which is the same as contradicting the explicit order of the National Government in the 23rd year which stated that there shall be no more additional taxes on the land, and ask for advice from the Provincial government to bring the previous case to a close and stop this compensation. The Ministry approved on August 10th, same year, “ask for advice to be passed to Jiangsu Provincial Government to rectify it altogether and submit to the ministry for review.” On November 10th of the same year, according to the provincial order, Huang presented a document stating that Taixian’s collection of winter grain in the 23rd year was approved, and it comes with a minor compensation of two yuan and five jiao per stone. The previous additional taxes have not been seen by the provincial government for rectification by the Ministry’s advice. However, in October of the same year, it was seen that the Taixian County Magistrate Zhang Yi issued a notice to collect compensation of one yuan and five jiao per two liang for the upper and lower busy silver in the 24th year. The subsequent additional taxes are being collected actively. In order to support the explicit order of the National Government and respect the repeated advice from the Ministry, there shall be no silence. A county government notice is presented again to the Ministry of Finance, asking to urge Jiangsu Provincial Government to promptly abolish the order to collect small labor compensation for Guiding Huai River on per-mu or per-tax basis, and instruct Taixian County Government to return the collected winter grain compensation and stop the busy silver compensation of one yuan and five jiao per two liang, so as to comply with the case of advising the province to stop and to advise the province for overall rectification. I now know that Huang received the Ministry of Finance’s Approval No. 8150 on December 27th of the same year, “All of the presented documents have been read, Ask for advice again to Jiangsu Provincial Government for overall processing and submit to the ministry for review. Documents have been stored,” etc.</p>

<h3>Railway Station Police Prohibited from Confiscating Silver Coins; Municipal Government Orders the Bureau to Handle Appropriately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce stating that merchants traveling to the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to collect debts were unable to exchange the silver coins they received for legal tender. Upon arriving at the Shanghai station, the silver coins were often confiscated and sent for fines. The chamber requested that three bank exchange offices be set up at each station along the line. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce considered that the methods for exchanging legal tender were stipulated in various orders from the ministry and that it would be difficult to establish exchange offices at the three banks. It submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government stating that military police should not confiscate the silver coins collected by merchants that cannot be exchanged for legal tender, and that the silver subsidiary coins were used for change with legal tender and confiscation was inappropriate. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a response from the Shanghai Municipal Government, Document No. 12365, stating that the request was noted. After investigating the case, repeated telegrams from the Ministry of Finance were approved and have been forwarded to the Public Security Bureau for compliance. In response to the aforementioned request, in addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to handle the matter appropriately in accordance with the methods set by the ministry, you are hereby notified. The chamber of commerce will forward the notice to the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Premier Chiang Tries to Persuade Xu Shiying to Stay</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Commission, recently submitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan, citing difficulties in handling affairs and a shortage of funds. It is now learned that Premier Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed Xu, sincerely urging him to stay. The original telegram is as follows: Xu Jingren, Chairman of the Relief Commission, Renji Hall, Yunnan Road. Relief work is important, and you are crucial to presiding over it. It is hoped that you will continue to serve with great ambition and not insist on resigning. If there are any difficulties, I will find a way to resolve them. Chiang Chung-cheng, 30th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Steamship Tickets on the Yangtze River Increase in Price; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Expresses Opposition; Jardine Matheson and Swire Consider Increasing Prices by 10 Percent; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Other Companies Find It Difficult to Express Sympathy</h3>
<p>Swire &amp; Sons has the most steamships on the Yangtze River, accounting for the first place among the six companies. The captains, chief officers, and chief engineers are all from their own country, and their salaries are calculated in gold pounds. Recently, since the implementation of the legal tender, the pound price has risen covertly, and 90% of the materials used by the ships are foreign goods. The prices of oil and coal, two fuel items, have also increased compared to two months ago. To compensate for the hidden losses, the company is discussing with Jardine Matheson and other companies to increase ship ticket prices uniformly by 10%, regardless of whether the voyage is upstream or downstream, starting in January. Jardine Matheson has agreed. However, because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ships are all first-class ships, Swire &amp; Sons sent a letter to the Bureau, requesting a uniform price increase. After discussing, Chinese shipping companies, including China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, said that although Swire and other companies' reasons for increasing ship ticket prices are very legitimate, given the current economic downturn and the gradual completion of highway transportation in various places, in addition to railway cars, there are also aviation aircraft. From a business standpoint, it is difficult to raise prices. Moreover, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned enterprise. The first-class cabin fares on the Jinghan (Beijing-Hankou) section of the Yangtze River are difficult to relate to. Based on this point, a reply was sent to the foreign steamship companies.</p>

<h3>City Federation Petitions the Central Government to Protest Japanese Use of Japanese Currency; Notifies All District Branches to Unanimously Refuse Its Use</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, upon reading reports that Japanese residents in Shanghai plan to issue Japanese currency in Shanghai this year, which would harm China's economy and disrupt the unification of the currency system, yesterday submitted a petition to the Central Government, requesting a protest be lodged, and notified all district branches to unanimously refuse its use. The contents of the letter and telegram are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>To the Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Yesterday, Shanghai newspapers reported that Japanese residents in Shanghai, due to the implementation of legal tender in China since November 4, have been greatly affected in their business. Currently, in order to reverse this crisis and develop business, they plan to issue banknotes in Shanghai for circulation in various treaty ports in China. Although nominally claimed to be for the internal use of the Japanese and not to hinder the system of China's currency, this policy is no less than seizing our domestic economic market, disrupting the unification of our currency system, and destroying the legal tender policy. If a strong protest is not lodged and circulation is not rejected, the future of China's industry and commerce will be a hidden worry. Therefore, we specifically petition your (Government) (Yuan) (Departments) to promptly raise a serious protest and prohibit this banknote policy in order to maintain sovereignty and benefit industry and commerce. Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation respectfully presents.</p>
<p>Notification to Refuse Use</p>
<p>The Federation also notified all district branches to instruct all shops to refuse the use of Japanese currency, stating: With respect, since the implementation of our country's legal tender policy, the industry and commerce of Japanese residents in Shanghai have been affected. Now, in order to exclude our country's currency system and actively suppress our country's industry and commerce, they plan to issue Japanese banknotes for circulation in our country's treaty ports. Although personnel from the Japanese Consulate have stated that the circulation of these banknotes is for mutual use among Japanese residents to increase funds and not for external use, this strategy is a prelude to invading our country's economy. All of our citizens should refuse to use it. In addition to petitioning the competent authorities of the National Government to raise a serious protest, we specifically notify you that from now on, whenever you encounter these banknotes, you must refuse to accept them to show your determination. We hope that you will inform all members to refuse to accept and use them in order to benefit national sovereignty and protect the unification of our country's legal tender.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Received Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (December 31st), this newspaper received flood relief donations totaling 40 yuan from Mr. Xing Mingxiu, 15 yuan from Mr. Xu Chengming, 12 yuan from Mr. Huang Kaide (remitted from the United States), 2 yuan from Mr. Zhang Yousheng, 3 yuan from Ms. Sun Yunxuan, an anonymous donation (12 cents in postage stamps), one lost foreign yuan handed over by the China-France Pharmacy, one yuan each from Mr. Song Yalin, Mr. Fang Rong, Mr. Gen Shen, Mr. Fu Shen, Mr. Quan Shen, Mr. Zaishen, and Mr. Xingshen, 5 yuan from Ms. Wang Er, totaling 85 yuan in silver dollars and 12 cents in postage stamps.</p>
<h3>Wen Yuqing Promoted to Director of the Department of Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications; Goes to Nanjing to Meet with Acting Minister Yu for Instructions</h3>
<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has been promoted to Director of the Department of Telegraph Administration of the ministry. After receiving the order, Mr. Wen took the night express train to Nanjing the night before last to meet with Mr. Yu Feipeng, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications and acting minister, to seek instructions on all matters.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Recent Situation Report</h3>
<p>Throughout the entire year of the Republic of China year twenty-four, the rapid progress and excellent achievements of the China National Aviation Corporation were unprecedented since its establishment. The board of directors, noting that the total business volume of the twenty-third year increased by seventy percent compared to the twenty-second year, decided to purchase large aircraft to expand its business. As a result, the total business volume of the twenty-fourth year increased by one and a half times compared to the twenty-third year, which was truly beyond expectations.</p>
<p>The Ford aircraft arrived in Shanghai in March of the twenty-fourth year and was used for flights to Chongqing, passing through Guiyang and reaching Kunming, taking only four hours, allowing for a round trip on the same day. The new Douglas large aircraft arrived in Shanghai in March of the twenty-fourth year and joined the Shanghai-Peiping (Beijing) line, reducing flight time by three hours. Departing from Shanghai at 6:30 AM, it could arrive in Peiping at 12:30 PM, allowing passengers to still have lunch. The Shanghai-Chengdu line used seaplanes, but as they had not yet arrived, Ford aircraft were temporarily purchased to join the Shanghai-Hankou line, reducing flight time by three hours. Departing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM, it could arrive in Hankou at 11:30 AM. Once the seaplanes arrived, the Ford aircraft would be transferred to the Chongqing-Chengdu line, as the Chongqing-Chengdu route had one round trip per day, making this aircraft ideal. In addition, another Douglas large aircraft was purchased and arrived in Shanghai at the end of September of the twenty-fourth year, specifically for a special express flight on the Shanghai-Chengdu route. This flight operated twice a week, departing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM and arriving in Chengdu at 3:30 PM. The Hankou-Chongqing route originally had three flights per week but was changed to four flights. Together with the two special express flights, there were a total of six flights. The Chongqing-Chengdu route originally had four flights per week but was changed to one round trip per day, with two additional special express flights. From then on, air travel from Shanghai to Chengdu developed rapidly, and travelers no longer lamented the difficulty of the Shu Road. Since the introduction of special express flights on the Shanghai-Chengdu route, all airmail became more time-saving and convenient. Previously, mail from Shanghai to Chengdu took three days to arrive, but now it only took two days for a round trip. As for ticket prices, they had already been reduced by twenty to thirty-five percent last year, as large aircraft had more seats, reducing the burden on each passenger, and the number of passengers booking seats on large aircraft increased daily. To promote business, the company planned to further reduce prices in the future, further alleviating the burden on passengers.</p>
<p>The achievements of the twenty-fourth year were as mentioned above, and the board of directors constantly strived for further improvement, hoping that the achievements after the twenty-fifth year would be even more remarkable. Currently, the company had also expanded the Guangzhou-Hanoi line, from Guangzhou through Guangzhou Bay to Hanoi, which was under French control. Trial flights had already been conducted, and formal flights were scheduled to begin in January of this year, reducing the time for mail from our country to Europe and providing greater convenience for passengers.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Congratulates Chen Jie on Entering Politics</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Zeqing, a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been appointed as the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government. At a recent routine meeting of the Municipal Council, the Chairman, Mr. Arnold, stated that the entire board of directors was delighted by this news. He also said that since Mr. Chen had been appointed to an important position in the National Government, he would likely be unable to continue in his role as director of the Municipal Council. It would be necessary to elect someone else to fill his position. However, the colleagues in the council should express their sincere congratulations on Mr. Chen's prestigious appointment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special District Court Agreement to Remain Valid for Three More Years Judicial Authorities Not Prepared to Take Over</h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, the Shanghai Special District Court agreement will expire at the end of March of the twenty-fifth year. According to the agreement, if our country wishes to modify or terminate it, it should give notice six months in advance. Since our country's authorities did not give any prior notice, the agreement will be extended for another three years. Therefore, our country's judicial authorities are currently not prepared to take over and do not intend to terminate the agreement. The news reported by various newspapers in the past was not factual.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bankers Association Held Regular Meeting Yesterday Resolved the Date of Final Settlement</h3>
<p>The third regular meeting of the third session of the Shanghai Bankers Association was held ahead of schedule yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the conference room on the second floor of the association. Ninety-nine representatives from forty-nine member banks attended to discuss important matters such as the date of the final settlement for the twenty-fourth year and interest rates. The details of the resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>The following forty-nine member banks were represented at yesterday's meeting: Shun Kang, Ding Kang, Chun Yuan, Heng Tong, Zhi Yu, Qing Cheng, Hong Xiang, Fu Kang, Ju Kang, He, Zi Kang, Zheng Xiang, Heng Jiu, Dun Yu, Da De, Zhen Tai, Da Lai, Da, etc. The following ninety-nine bank representatives attended: Sheng Xiao, Yan Dayou, Pei Yunqing, Qian Yuansheng, Zhang Mengzhou, Wang Jamei, Qin Zernan, Shao Yanshan, Shen Jing, Wang Yangsu, He Xiao, Chen Zhongwu, etc. The meeting was chaired by He Zhongxiao.</p>
<p>Reported Matters</p>
<p>The reported matters included:</p>
<p>1. Minutes of the previous meeting.</p>
<p>2. Incoming and outgoing documents for December: 48 incoming documents and 508 outgoing documents.</p>
<p>3. Eighteen meetings of the same industry were held at the association in December.</p>
<p>4. Approved the Executive Committee's draft of the format for promissory notes, checks, and drafts to comply with the regulations of the Negotiable Instruments Law. It was submitted to the winter managers' meeting for discussion, and it was unanimously agreed that unifying the format of negotiable instruments was a matter that our industry should improve. However, it was decided that uniformly implementing the proposed format on January 1, twenty-fifth year, would be wasteful as many banks have already pre-printed blank forms. It was proposed that starting from January 1, all old-style negotiable instruments should be stamped with the words "promissory note," "check," and "draft" to comply with the Negotiable Instruments Law. After the blank forms are used up, continue to print and use the proposed format to standardize it. This was resolved and is hereby reported for your information and implementation.</p>
<p>5. Approved the reply from the Syndicate Lending Committee stating that they had received your association's letter stating that the interest rates originally set for loans to banks lacking funds were already self-restrained during that time of emergency. Now that the market is gradually becoming more active and lending rates have fallen, please consider reducing the rates. In addition, the Shanghai Banking Supervision Committee of the Ministry of Finance also sent a letter with the same request. After consultation among the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, it was unanimously agreed that the three banks provide loans to the banks at a weekly interest rate of 8%. The loans provided by other banks are calculated at a monthly interest rate of 8%. Compared with this, the interest rate is already reduced. The request is difficult to comply with.</p>
<p>6. Various reports on the reserve fund.</p>
<p>Resolved Matters</p>
<p>The following motions were then discussed and resolved:</p>
<p>1. Motion on the interbank lending rate for December: Resolved to deduct 3.95%.</p>
<p>2. Motion on the handling of business before and after the final settlement for the twenty-fourth year: Resolved:</p>
<p>1. The date of the final settlement for the twenty-fourth year is set as January 23, twenty-fifth year.</p>
<p>2. The interest rate before the final settlement is set at $2.50, settled on January 15th and January 20th.</p>
<p>3. The time for receiving checks is set from January 19th to 4:00 PM. Returned checks will be extended by one hour as usual. On January 23rd, checks will be cleared as they arrive.</p>
<p>4. The market lending rate will be open until January 22nd.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society Work for the Year 24</h3>
<p>— (Song Hanzhang)</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society has released its work for the past year. Our society is organized by Chinese and foreign individuals and is the earliest established in Shanghai. Reports on the various emergency relief efforts undertaken over the decades have been submitted to all sectors of society. Last year's severe drought in the Southeast led to a particularly severe spring famine this year. The ongoing efforts were mostly uncompleted tasks from the previous year. However, during the period between April and May, when there was a shortage of old and new crops, the general disaster victims were at a critical point between life and death. Our society had reached a point where it could not raise any more funds and had exhausted all its resources. We wanted to stop but could not. We were in a dilemma. Fortunately, the directors of the society either contributed from their own pockets or found ways to raise funds, so that we could complete the spring relief effort. Just when we hoped that the disaster victims would be able to recover and our colleagues could take a break, the rivers and lakes flooded again in the summer. From autumn to winter, until the river water gradually subsided and the river water rose again, spreading daily, the affected area expanded, and the number of people drowned and the amount of property lost was appalling. If it were not for the fact that benevolent people at home and abroad considered it their duty to provide continuous assistance, the disaster would have been even more terrible. Our society usually has an annual publication, but editing and printing must wait for the accounts of each branch and must be audited by an accountant. Therefore, publication must be in the coming spring. We are grateful for the concern of all sectors of society. We will first report the approximate course of the relief efforts for the year as follows. The statistics on the disbursement of relief funds are as follows: This year, a total of 300,710 yuan was disbursed for relief funds, which were distributed to the disaster area branches for handling as follows:</p>
<p>Shandong: A branch was specially set up in Jining, with a total of 52,000 yuan allocated to handle emergency winter relief in various districts such as Ningcheng, Yucheng, Juye, Heze, Yutai, Jinxiang, Dongping, Zhang. Five hospitals and shelters were also set up to save lives. The investigators showed a great fearless spirit and ventured forward in the wind and waves. Their courage to do good is admirable.</p>
<p>Jiangsu: A total of 141,200 yuan was allocated, starting with relief for the red drought and spring famine, followed by two emergency winter relief efforts for the Yellow River disaster. Branches were set up in the Xuzhou and Haizhou regions. In the south, relief was provided in various districts such as Yixing, Liyang, Lishui, Jurong, Liuhe, Danyang, and Changzhou. In the north, relief was provided in counties such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Peixian, Pizhou, Suqian, Shuyang, and Huaiyin. Relief centers, porridge factories, shelters, medical clinics, and orphanages were all included.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Basin: Hubei and Hunan provinces were the most severely affected. A total of 58,000 yuan was allocated, and special commissioners were sent to conduct emergency winter relief. According to a report from a western commissioner, "I witnessed the torrent of water, the collapse of the banks, and the submergence of farmland and villages in an instant last autumn. Now that the north wind has risen again, the land is full of wailing, with people without clothes or food, crying from hunger and cold. Recalling the past and thinking about the present, it is even more difficult to let go."</p>
<p>Fujian and Guangdong Disaster Areas: Our society has allocated 10,000 yuan for emergency relief. In Fujian, a Sino-Western Committee was established in Quanzhou to be responsible for investigation and distribution. In Guangdong, members of the Guangzhou Relief Society were hired to assist in the process. If the funds are insufficient, more will be provided.</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Due to the early drought in the spring, 9,510 yuan was allocated to provide relief to the most severely affected areas of Haining and Haiyan, and to subsidize the porridge factories in Jiaxing.</p>
<p>Anhui: As only northern Anhui suffered from drought, our society, limited by its resources, allocated 3,000 yuan to Huoqiu to provide relief to the most needy. We hope that all sectors of society will pay attention to this and provide universal relief to the people.</p>
<p>In addition to receiving 98 boxes and 1,900 pieces of relief clothing from overseas Chinese and domestic donations, which were immediately transferred to the aforementioned areas, 27,000 yuan was allocated to make 30,000 new cotton clothes to make up for the shortage. All the allocated funds and clothing were enthusiastically assisted by banks and shipping companies, who provided free services. The distribution procedures were supervised by Chinese and Western individuals in various places, working together to ensure that everything was done correctly. Although emergency winter relief has been vigorously promoted, agricultural production has been lost in the dry areas, and it cannot be restored in a short period of time. Therefore, spring relief must also be planned in advance, otherwise it will be difficult to completely save the victims. I am afraid that our compatriots will not die in the winter, but will die in the spring, and all our efforts will be in vain. This is a matter of great concern to our colleagues. Our society's purpose has always been to consider disaster prevention more important than disaster relief. In this cold weather, with rain and snow, and with starvation everywhere, it is necessary to provide immediate relief. If benevolent people are willing to provide clothing and food, or donate money and entrust us to distribute it to designated relief areas, we are willing to do our best. Please contact our society at No. 97 Renji Road, Shanghai, next to the Zhongfu Bank, on the fourth floor.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce to Prepare for Real Estate Bank Soon Orders Silver and Money Guilds to Accept Factory Land and Property Mortgage Loans</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a joint letter from 72 trade associations, including the Paper Industry, Construction Factory, Woolen Industry, requesting that the Ministry of Finance instruct the Central Bank to expedite rediscounting and order the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of Communications to accept as much land title mortgage applications as possible from industrial and commercial enterprises to alleviate the industrial and commercial crisis. After submitting the request to the Ministry of Finance, the following instructions were received: "Your presentation has been noted. The Ministry has long been aware of the difficulties you presented in your letter and has repeatedly issued orders to maintain the situation for the past year, and each closing period has been safely passed. The recent implementation of the legal tender policy is a key plan for economic recovery. Since its implementation, finance has gradually become more active and the market has undergone a turnaround. The Ministry is also actively drafting and revising various financial regulations to improve the current financial system and facilitate the development of enterprises. We have sent a letter to the Central Bank requesting it to recruit commercial shares in accordance with the law and to reorganize itself to fulfill the responsibilities of a bank. The Real Estate Mortgage Bank is also under active preparation. In order to activate land credit, we have once again requested the Executive Yuan to transfer the request to the Legislative Yuan and the Judicial Yuan to amend the real estate mortgage regulations, so that land and factory land and property can be conveniently mortgaged. At the same time, we have requested the Central Bank to expedite the rediscounting of bills to facilitate the circulation of funds, which is in line with the intention of your association to activate old chips and circulate new chips. Your request to accept as many land title mortgage applications as possible is not in line with the three banks' regulations. We have ordered the establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank as soon as possible to meet the needs. As for ordering all banks and firms to accept factory land and property mortgage loans, we have transferred the order to the Shanghai Silver and Money Guild to inform all banks and firms. Please be informed, etc." It was issued under the Shanghai Qianzi No. 14 order and ordered the Shanghai Silver and Money Guild to be informed. Please be informed of this order.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Association Borrowed Funds from Shanghai Banks to Establish 160,000 Yuan Fully Paid Out Yesterday at a Monthly Interest Rate of 1% with Repayment in Seven Months</h3>
<p>Due to the improvement in silk exports and the soaring silk prices, the Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Association faced a shortage of raw materials and could not meet the demand. Therefore, it contacted the banking community in Shanghai to borrow funds for spring silkworm seeds. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Industrial Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank shared the loan burden. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each provided 28,000 yuan, the Shanghai Industrial Bank and the Jiangsu Bank each provided 26,000 yuan, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank provided 30,000 yuan, for a total of 160,000 yuan. The Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Association has been in contact with the banks for several days, and the six banks have fully paid out the loans. As for the guarantee, the silkworm and mulberry business fees collected in the spring of the twenty-fifth year will be used as the primary guarantee, with repayment in seven months and a monthly interest rate of 1%. It is reported that the association will repay the first batch of funds at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Arikawa Akira's New Year's Reflections</p>
<p>According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Arikawa, recently wrote an essay with his New Year's reflections. It was published in Chinese and foreign newspapers on New Year's Day. The original text reads, "Due to the efforts of officials and civilians in both countries, Sino-Japanese relations have gradually tended to return to normal, which is very gratifying. However, since the independence of 'Manchukuo,' the relationship between the two countries has become more complex than before, politically, economically, and even socially. This atmosphere can be seen after the emergence of the autonomous movement of the people in North China, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, if we truly want to establish a clear and peaceful relationship between the two countries in the future, officials and civilians in both countries must work harder. To this end, we must calmly consider the international situation and the special relationship between the two countries, and seek realistic adjustment methods. If we only act emotionally, it will not only be useless but will increase disputes, which will be harmful to the future of both countries. As for the adjustment methods for Sino-Japanese relations, there are various working methods, but the fundamental issue before starting them must be that officials and civilians in both countries truly recognize that mutual assistance between the two countries can increase the well-being of both countries and maintain the interdependent relationship of peace in East Asia. If we do not start from this understanding, no matter what adjustment methods are used, the result will only be temporary. In the past few decades, Japan has stepped forward at a time when China was on the verge of division, and has made great sacrifices to protect friendly countries. Unfortunately, in recent years, it has been misled by a part of China's revolutionary diplomacy, which has greatly hindered the friendly relations between the two countries, which is very regrettable. However, recently, even though it is still an exception in China, it has gradually realized the great meaning of coexistence, which is a gratifying phenomenon. In addition, the reorganization of the National Government last winter, with Chiang Kai-shek taking responsibility for politics and diplomacy, and most of the other ministers being people who understand Japan, shows that China attaches great importance to Japan. I hope that Mr. Chiang will use his insight to complete domestic unification, realize that cooperation with Japan is indispensable, make good use of his power to promote self-salvation and unification internally, and liquidate the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians externally. Furthermore, he should establish new relations with sincerity and practice that can prove the great meaning of coexistence between China and Japan. At the same time, Japan must also be aware of the responsibility of the Empire in the stable forces of the Far East, and guide the Chinese side to a sincere national policy and provide assistance for its transformation."</p>
<h3>November Statistics on Donation Achievements from the Hotel and Aviation Industries; Smooth Progress in Changing the Method of Aviation Donations from Dance Halls</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association, Shanghai Recruiting Team Headquarters, in order to extensively raise funds for aviation to save the country, organized the collection of aviation donations from the dance hall industry in this city. Since it began on August 15th of last year, the results have been excellent. In order to facilitate the process, the headquarters has slightly changed the method of collecting small donations, entrusting each dance hall to collect them when issuing bills. For dance tickets where each yuan buys less than six tickets, a small donation of one dime (大洋一角) is collected. For six tickets or more, a donation of five cents (大洋五分) is collected. This began on the 23rd of the previous month, and thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of various dance halls and the generous donations of compatriots from all walks of life, the results have been very good and the progress has been quite smooth.</p>
<p>Since the start of collecting small aviation donations from the hotel industry to save the country, the detailed amounts of donations received have been announced monthly.

<h3>Industry Association of Boiled Water Vendors Passes Donation of 100,000 Yuan for Aviation; Designates "Boiled Water Industry" Airplane</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association, Recruiting Team Headquarters, in order to promote the significance of aviation, instill aviation knowledge, and raise aviation funds, in addition to hiring recruiting team leaders to recruit members, also organized the collection of aviation donations from various industries. Those that have achieved results include the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, brick and tile industry, sand and gravel industry, dance hall industry, freight truck industry, and over ten other groups. The headquarters, considering that the boiled water industry is also a daily necessity for the people, specifically hired the chairman of the industry association, Li Shengxian, as the team leader to plan and collect aviation donations from the boiled water industry. It is learned that the association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss the implementation plan. Over ten committee members, including Li Shengxian and He Qichang, attended. Zhang Yuliang and Zhang Xiamin from the Aviation Association's team headquarters attended to provide guidance. Chairman Li Shengxian presided and Luo Weishan recorded the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the process of convening the meeting, followed by Zhang Yuliang, a representative of the Aviation Association, who gave a speech on the significance and need for aviation to save the country. Then, discussions began and the following was resolved: 1. Raise 100,000 yuan in donations to designate a "Boiled Water Industry" airplane. 2. The method of raising funds was decided to be of two types, A and B. Type A, those who also sell tea, will add one copper coin per pot. The standard for these small collections will be estimated and determined by the association. Type B, those who only sell tea and water, will donate one yuan per month. All detailed collection methods will be formulated by the Aviation Association after the survey is completed and submitted. 4. Divide the area into four regions: South Shanghai, North Shanghai, East Shanghai, and West Shanghai, and assign responsible personnel for each region to conduct surveys. 5.

<h3>Central Savings Society Opening Postponed; Ye Zhuotang Temporarily Serves as Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Immediately Assuming Office After Returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau has specifically established the Central Savings Society, which specializes in various special savings businesses. Personnel in charge have been appointed by order. Due to unfinished preparatory procedures, the opening will be postponed to January. According to a reporter's inquiries, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drafting Various Regulations: The Central Trust Bureau allocated 5 million yuan to specifically establish the Central Savings Society and has appointed Li Shuming as manager to begin preparations. Various regulations are being drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. However, because the members of the supervisory committee have not yet been appointed, the originally scheduled opening on New Year's Day has now been postponed to January 15th.</p>
<p>Lucky Draw Savings Account Registration: The bureau took over the handling of the Central Savings Society's lucky draw savings accounts. Registration for account holders, which was scheduled to close on December 15th, was extended by ten days due to a small number of account holders who had not yet registered. However, even by December 31st, there were still people requesting to register, and the bureau accommodated them. The bureau is closed for three days starting today, New Year's Day, and will begin calculations on the 4th.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Temporarily Serves as Director: Director Zhang Gongquan, after being appointed Minister of Railways, resigned from the bureau because he was too busy with ministerial affairs to manage the bureau. The Ministry of Finance has now ordered Ye Zhuotang, a standing director of the Central Bank, to temporarily act as director. Mr. Ye is currently on a trip to Hong Kong and has not yet assumed office.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Commends Members of the Security Corps; Awards Ceremony Held at 9 AM on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, based on a report from the Shanghai Security Committee that Qu Huaili and Chi Mingqing, squad leaders of the 5th Team of the Security Corps in the North Shanghai District, bravely captured bandits, submitted it to the 296th Municipal Government Meeting. It was decided to award Qu Huaili and Chi Mingqing each a Second Class, Second Grade medal to encourage them. Yesterday, the Security Committee was specifically notified that the awards ceremony will be held at 9 AM on New Year's Day in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium.</p>
<h3>Liquidation Office of the World Bank to Distribute 30% of Savings on a Fixed Date; Full Repayment for Debts Below 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the World Bank declared its closure, it has begun liquidation. The savings department has now collected a portion of cash. It has been decided that starting from the 6th of this month, from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM daily, 30% of savings will be distributed at the liquidation office at 349 Jiangxi Road. Debts with an original value of 50 yuan or less will be fully repaid. The remaining unpaid portion of the savings department and debts owed to the commercial department are currently being collected to prepare for repayment.</p>
<h3>Dahua Bank Repays Deposits</h3>
<p>Dahua Commercial Savings Bank announced the repayment of the third installment of deposits, stating: Regarding the phased repayment of various deposits by this bank, in addition to the first and second installments which have been repaid on schedule, the third installment of fixed-term savings deposits above 1,000 yuan will be repaid on average at 20% starting on January 18, 1936. Repayments will still be made at the bank's liquidation office within Xu Yongzuo's accounting firm at 123 Avenue Edward VII. As for the liquidation affairs of the Hangzhou branch, they have now been merged into the head office. Therefore, fixed-term savings deposits above 1,000 yuan from that branch will also be repaid at 20% at the bank's liquidation office in Shanghai starting on the same date. In addition to notifying the liquidation office to handle this, it is hoped that all account holders will bring their certificates and seals to collect the money when it is due. As for other types of deposits, the repayment period has not yet arrived, so please do not make unnecessary trips. This is stated together for clarification.</p>
<h3>Record of the Establishment of the South Society Commemorative Association</h3>
<p>For 30 years, the South Society, which has held unparalleled glory in the Chinese literary world, was formally established on November 13, 1909 (October 1st of the first year of the Qing Xuantong era) by Mr. Chen Chaonan, Mr. Gao Tianmei, and Mr. Liu Yazi. In that year, the first collection of the South Society Series was published. Subsequently, after the publication of the 22nd collection of the South Society Series in December 1923 (the 12th year of the Republic of China), it completely ceased operations, with a total history of 15 years. There were 1,178 members, an unprecedented event since the Fushe and Jishe of the late Ming Dynasty. The New South Society was formally established on October 10, 1923, and stopped after May 5, 1924. One issue of the New South Society Journal was published, and there were about 200 to 300 members. Recently, Mr. Liu Yazi, the founder and director of the South Society and president of the New South Society, issued a declaration deciding to organize the South Society Commemorative Association to perpetuate its legacy. A temporary luncheon was held the other day at Jinlong Western Restaurant on Xizang Road in Shanghai. Attendees included Liu Yazi, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and director of the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office; Chen Taoyi, secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Ma Junwu, president of Guangxi University; Zhou Zhicheng, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Huang Binhong, director of the temporary board of the Shanghai Museum; Hu Pu'an, president of Minbao Newspaper; Gao Chuiwan, director of Hande Society and the National Studies Exchange Association; Yao Shizi, former director of the South Society; Sun Zhongying, secretary of the Municipal Government; Zhu Fengwei, section chief; Zhu Shaoping, deputy director of the Municipal Gazetteer Office; Xu Weinan, chief compiler; Zhu Shujian, secretary of the Municipal Council; Lu Danlin, director of the Roads Monthly Journal; Wang Jiyuan, master painter; Ge Yinwu and Chen Naigan, book collectors; Gao Junxiang and Tang Mingshi, famous lawyers; Bai Jiao and Huang Miaozi, young writers; and others, totaling more than 20 people. The clinking of glasses created a magnificent atmosphere. It is said that the first official gathering next year will be held in Shanghai around the Spring Festival. The declaration and regulations are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Declaration of the South Society Commemorative Association: The South Society has become a historical term. To revive it is not only factually impossible but also theoretically unnecessary. Because the literary trend of the world is advancing, and the current literary environment in China is definitely not the literary environment of 1909. If we advocate clinging to the old and associating with friends who are generally going backwards, how can there be good results? However, while the literature of the South Society absolutely does not need to be revived, the spirit of the South Society still has commemorative value. We are now launching this South Society Commemorative Association, on the one hand, to remember the glory of the past, and on the other hand, to hope for future efforts. But the path of this effort is definitely not the revival of the South Society. After the South Society, there was also the New South Society, which is exactly the same as the Chinese Revolutionary Party after the Tongmenghui. The only difference is that we do not have Mr. Sun Yat-sen's perseverance and courage to reorganize the Chinese Revolutionary Party into the Kuomintang. Therefore, although the nature of the New South Society and the South Society is different, the spirit is consistent. Our current commemoration of the South Society also includes the significance of commemorating the New South Society. This should be mentioned incidentally. Finished. December 1935, Liu Yazi.</p>
<p>Regulations of the South Society Commemorative Association: The purpose of this association is to commemorate the past glory of the South Society and the New South Society in the literary history. Members of the South Society and the New South Society are automatically members of this association. Please report your most recent address to the association at any time by mail. Non-members who express sympathy for the South Society and the New South Society may join as volunteer members, but must have an introduction from two or more ordinary members, stating their name, gender, age, place of origin, and address. You can join at any time by mail. The association holds two gatherings each year. The location and date will be announced temporarily. The current founder of the South Society serves as the president of the association. There is also a secretary, accountant, and general affairs officer, each appointed by the president. Part-time positions are permitted. This association does not collect membership fees, but a meal fee is collected at the time of gatherings. If other expenses are needed, members may donate freely. The mailing address of this association is temporarily located at the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office, 291 Sapo Sai Road, Shanghai. If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, the president may revise them at their discretion and announce them at any time.</p>
<h3>New Building of the Shanghai Bank's Xiaodongmen Branch Completed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's Xiaodongmen branch in this city has been open for six years. It strives to provide excellent service to its customers, so its business is quite developed. Because the original building at 77 Dongmen Road was insufficient for its needs, a new building was built at 19 Minguo Road, north of Xiaodongmen. The construction is now complete, and it is scheduled to open for business on the 4th of this month. It will then be able to provide even more opportunities to serve the community.</p>
<h3>China Travel Service to Collect Postal Mail; Pilot Program to Be Implemented in 14 Locations Including Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate communication for travelers and all sectors of society, has entrusted China Travel Service and its branches in other cities as urban postal agencies. A pilot program will be implemented first in 16 China Travel Service locations, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Tianjin, Zhenjiang, Hankou, Bengbu, Jiujiang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Jinhua, and Xi'an. All mail, airmail, small parcel mail, registered mail, and express mail can be collected and sent on their behalf, and stamps and tax stamps can be sold on their behalf. This is scheduled to take effect on New Year's Day. The mail collection and delivery times for each branch are the same as those of the post office.</p>
<h3>Berenzy Reappointed as Land Commissioner of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>According to Article 6A of the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations, the Public Works Department should appoint one Land Commissioner each year. It has been found that for nearly six years, Mr. Berenzy has continued to serve as the Land Commissioner of the Public Works Department. At a meeting held by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department a few days ago, it was decided that Mr. Berenzy will continue to serve as the Land Commissioner of the Public Works Department from 1936 to 1937.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Held Staff Social Gathering Yesterday; Xu Jianping Gave a Sincere Speech Encouraging All Staff Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association held a social gathering for all staff members at the Great China Building on Sichuan Road yesterday at 6:30 PM. Over 50 male and female staff members from various groups, including general affairs, relief, security, education, and health, as well as affiliated institutions such as the Educational Institution, Clinic, and Nursery, attended. Chen Tiesheng, the deputy secretary-general, first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by Xu Jianping, the secretary, who gave an instructional speech, offering much encouragement to the staff members of all departments. Then, Chen Zhengfan and Ding Bingnan gave speeches, offering suggestions for the association's affairs. Finally, Yao Shuwen, Zhang Wanqing, Zhang Yueru, and Wang Zhenchang performed entertainment, which was quite wonderful and very interesting. The gathering adjourned around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>British-Run Buses in the International Settlement to Increase Fares Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>British-run buses in the International Settlement have now scheduled a fare increase starting tomorrow. With the exception of Route 9, which has already increased several times, fares on all other routes will increase by two copper coins per stop.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Announces the Adoption of the New System of Weights and Measures; Social Bureau to Conduct a Mobilization Inspection</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the International Settlement has announced that the regulations for licenses for bakeries and confectionery stores, Chinese food stores (outdoor food licenses), Class 1 and Class 2 foreign food stores, fruit stores or stalls, raw rice wholesalers or retailers (rice stores), and private vegetable markets within the settlement will be implemented on January 1, 1936, using the new system of weights and measures. After the change, those who possess inaccurate weights and measures, or store, sell, display for sale, or sell items with insufficient weight will be prosecuted. The Bureau of Social Affairs Weights and Measures Inspection Office of this city, in order to thoroughly eliminate private manufacture and private use within the settlement, has decided to conduct a mobilization inspection in mid-January.</p>
<h3>Gospel Radio Station Holds New Machine Completion Ceremony Today; Special Invitation for the Wife of Foreign Minister Zhang to Broadcast a Speech</h3>
<p>The Gospel Broadcasting Station on Museum Road was founded by Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, Xie Songgao, Li Guansen, Ding Zuochen, Mei Lide, Wang Wanbai, and others from the Shanghai Christian community and has been in operation for over two years. Recently, it has been approved by the Ministry of Communications to install the latest American-style equipment and expand the power to 1,000 watts. Construction is now complete and has been inspected and approved by the International Telecommunications Bureau. The new machine completion ceremony will be held from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM on New Year's Day, with speeches by Chinese and foreign dignitaries and various musical poems and songs. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, was originally invited to participate as a speaker, but due to her health, Miss Mao Yanwen was specially invited to represent her. Mrs. Ma Yuying, wife of Foreign Minister Zhang, was also invited to give a speech at the station. The station has prepared refreshments to welcome visitors from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Buddhist Esoteric Texts to Be Held at the Shanghai Branch of the Buddhist Studies Association Starting on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Master Tan Xuan, an expert in Esoteric Buddhism, was summoned back to the country from the Japanese Esoteric Buddhism Academy by Master Taixu, an expert in Buddhist education. He passed through Shanghai on his way to Wuchang Road, bringing with him over 2,000 Esoteric Buddhist books, including the works of ancient eminent monks and the writings of new and old eminent monks in Japan. These are all precious Tibetan editions, worth a fortune, and are rare scholarly materials. Esoteric Buddhism has been lost in China for over a thousand years, so many of the important books of this sect have been lost. This time, Master Tan Xuan returned from Japan, bringing them to China as a contribution to domestic eminent monks, adding brilliance to the academic community, and glorifying the Esoteric Buddhists, truly creating a groundbreaking feat. It is said that they will be publicly exhibited from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on January 1, 2, and 3, 1936, at the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Studies Association, 493 Xinjibang Road, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, this city. All members of the association will be admitted free of charge upon presentation of their membership cards. Non-members who wish to visit will be charged 2 dimes to show identification.</p>
<h3>Photography Exhibition of Shanghai Art College</h3>
<p>The Photography Society of the Shanghai Art College has been established for four years. The works of each exhibition have been well received by people from all walks of life. It is said that the society has scheduled the 8th and 9th practice exhibitions to be held from New Year's Day to the 3rd at the Shanghai Art College on Caishi Road in the French Concession. There are 100 pieces in this collection, and the results are considered excellent. The compositions are particularly rich in artistic meaning. In addition to the works of current members of the society, works have also been solicited from graduated members, such as Chen Jiaxu, Chen Jinshi, Ni Zhiyue, Zhang Lu, and Yan Jueping, and their works are also participating, making the results even more exciting. It is said that the exhibition will be open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, and visitors from all walks of life are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>The Civil New Village Is Being Completed Sequentially; Tenants Are Eagerly Registering; All Households Can Move in Today</h3>
<p>Since the Civil New Village in this city has been completed, the registration of tenants began on the 16th of this month and has been exceptionally enthusiastic. The rents are all as previously stipulated and are extremely low. The offices of each village have prepared everything for each village, so all registered households can move in today.</p>
<h3>News of the Establishment of the Shen Society</h3>

<h3>Further News on the Closure of Two Watch Companies; Unemployed Workers Request Severance Pay</h3>
<p>Since the Shi Weiji Watch Store on Nanjing Road and the former Shanghai Clock Company announced their liquidation on August 17 of this year, the court executed the auction of movable property. After the funds were taken by the court, dozens of employees of the two stores suddenly felt unemployed. They elected representatives to file a petition with the mediation court of the First Special District Court, requesting the issuance of severance pay. The presiding judge of the mediation court, considering that the matter concerned the livelihood of the employees, agreed to issue the pay to provide relief. The mediation was established to approve the issuance of severance pay of four months' salary per person. However, many days have passed and it has not yet been issued. It is said that the employees have been unemployed for several months, and they have been stranded in Shanghai. Not only are their personal livelihoods difficult, but their families are also in danger of freezing and starvation. The situation is extremely pitiful. A few days ago, dozens of employees held a meeting at a certain place and decided that all employees would file a petition with the president of the court on a specific date, requesting immediate issuance so that they could each seek a livelihood and avoid becoming destitute at sea. It is not known whether the president will be compassionate and issue the pay.</p>
<h3>Lü Quan-shi Invents Safe Kerosene Lamp Head; Ministry of Industry Grants Five-Year Patent; Manufacturing Plant to be Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Lü Quan-shi, an industrial expert from Fenghua, recently observed that the commonly used old-style kerosene lamp heads have many shortcomings, causing inconvenience and lacking safety during use. Furthermore, the annual import of foreign goods results in a significant outflow of funds. To prevent this leakage, regain rights, and correct various shortcomings of old-style lamp heads, Mr. Lü, based on his daily research, invented two types of "Bright and Safe Kerosene Lamp Heads" to meet social needs. The lamp heads have the following features:</p>
<p>*   Equipped with a safety switch, as convenient as an electric lamp.</p>
<p>*   The light stays on day and night, using very little oil.</p>
<p>*   Even after long burning, it does not produce soot and can ensure that the lampshade never bursts.</p>
<p>*   Saves lighting and loading/unloading time, incredibly convenient.</p>
<p>*   The brightness can be adjusted, increasing by one-half when fully opened, truly providing the function of one lamp for two uses.</p>
<p>*   The design is exquisite and beautiful, with a sturdy mechanical structure that is not easily damaged.</p>
<p>It is reported that this new lamp head will be manufactured in several sizes and can be used with any kerosene lamp. The price will be low to encourage widespread use. The Ministry of Industry has granted a five-year patent to promote it. To meet social needs, the inventor, Mr. Lü, plans to establish a large-scale manufacturing plant in Shanghai to manufacture them in large quantities, thereby regaining rights.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit for Issuing Bad Checks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory was founded by Zhang Rongchu and his partners, with Zhang serving as the general manager. After the market decline, the factory also failed and has been closed ever since. Many debts are unrecoverable. Tang Zhiyu, Cai Hesheng, Zhang Tianyun, and others are owed significant amounts of money. To stall, Zhang issued them bad checks. When Tang and others presented the checks at the bank, they discovered there were no funds. Feeling deceived, they hired a lawyer and filed a criminal lawsuit of issuing bad checks and fraud against Zhang Rongchu in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang held a hearing. The defendant, Zhang Rongchu, did not appear, but his lawyer, Yan E’sen, defended him, admitting that the factory owed money but claiming there was no fraud involved. The court then questioned the plaintiffs, who stated that the accusation of fraud in the complaint was a common mistake. They requested to withdraw the fraud charge and only accused Zhang of issuing bad checks because the checks were stamped with the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory seal and Zhang Rongchu's personal seal, so Zhang should also be responsible. After questioning, Judge Yang adjourned the hearing for a scheduled verdict.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing on Damage to Creditor Rights After the Bankruptcy of Dingsheng Bank; Case File to be Retrieved from the Civil Court for Rescheduling</h3>
<p>After the bankruptcy of Dingsheng Bank, the bank's manager, Xie Jian-shou, supervisor Yang Song-nian, and others appointed lawyers Zhang Ji and Xie Tang-yan to liquidate the assets. Subsequently, creditor Qi Wu-yin discovered that the bank had funds deposited in the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank. He petitioned the First Special District Court to legally seize the funds to protect creditor rights. However, after the court issued the seizure order, lawyer Zhang Ji had already withdrawn all the funds from the two banks. Qi and others then filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhang Ji, Xie Tang-yan, Yang Song-nian, and Xie Jian-shou in the First Special Court for damaging creditor rights. Two hearings had already been held, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang continued the hearing. According to Qi Wu-yin's testimony, Dingsheng Bank went bankrupt on May 28th, and the 10,000+ yuan in the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China was deposited by Zhang on June 3rd. The funds definitely belonged to Dingsheng Bank. Zhang withdrew them privately after the court's seizure order or concealed them. All the funds deposited in Zhang Ji's account in that branch were transferred from the bank's deposits. The plaintiff's lawyer then presented the court's two seizure rulings to prove the creditor rights, stating that the funds to be seized totaled over 130,000 yuan, but Zhang Ji had only deposited 30,000 yuan with the court. The court questioned the defendant Zhang Ji, who claimed that the liquidation office only received the 30,000 yuan seizure order and did not receive the 100,000+ yuan seizure order, so he was unaware of it. The plaintiff's lawyer refuted this, saying that the minutes of the shareholders' meeting clearly stated the seizure of over 100,000 yuan. How could he claim ignorance? Could the court's official documents be forged? Judge Yang ordered that the case file be retrieved from the civil court and the hearing be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Western Woman Hits Chinese Child</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 31st) at 12:12 PM, a Western woman surnamed [omitted], driving her private car number 2340, was driving eastbound on Avenue Edward VII when she reached the intersection of Fujian Road and Jingyuan Street, near the Xie Fengxiang tobacco and paper store at number 444. Suddenly, a boy, about twelve or thirteen years old, wearing a blue cloth long gown and black pants, attempted to cross the road from the British Concession to the French Concession. The Western woman couldn't brake in time and knocked the child down, crushing his head. He bled profusely and fainted instantly, barely breathing. Officer number 84 arrived and immediately reported to the police station by phone, who dispatched an ambulance to rush the injured child to a nearby hospital. It is reported that the injuries are severe, and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Habitual Thief Confesses to Theft</h3>
<p>The thief Zhu Boyun, 25 years old, from Zhejiang, lives at 2 Hongxing Lane, Jessfield Road. Wang Gen-shi, 26 years old, from Changzhou, lives at 303 Lu Xuezhai. Chen Jin-tang, 20 years old, from Ningbo, lives in a shack on Robegen Road, Xujiahui. He previously stole a bicycle from Dada Hardware Store on the Great Western Road and served two months in prison. Li Fu-sheng, 25 years old, from Chongming, lives at 14 North Caojiazhai. He stole a lined jacket, a woman's coat, a woolen shirt, and eighty thousand copper coins from the Tongxing Cigarette Store. This thief is highly skilled and has stolen from countless businesses. Last night, Zhu and others stole fifty-five thousand copper coins and clothes from Xu Wanxing Foreign Goods Store at 1075 East Market, Caojiadu. When the store owner Xu Bingzhong discovered the theft, the thieves had already fled. He immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau requesting investigation. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4 PM, officers Bian Yuliang and Shao Louhui apprehended the thieves one after another and brought them to the bureau. They confessed to stealing clothes, copper coins, etc., from Xu Wanxing's department store. They were immediately sent to the general bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>City Government Official Discusses Preparing for the Dongjiadu Ferry; Relief Measures Already in Place for Existing Private Ferries; Ordered the Xingye Trust Company to Start Operations by a Deadline</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The city's public ferry is the only means of transportation across the Huangpu River, and it is closely related to municipal development, commercial prosperity, and traveler safety. The Dongjiadu river-crossing ferry has been under construction for more than half a year, and all the engineering work is nearing completion. A reporter heard that this ferry can also transport automobiles and trucks, making it the newest facility in the city's municipal construction and something that general citizens and businesses are eagerly anticipating. The reporter visited the City Government to inquire about the progress. According to a statement released by a City Government official, the City Government, in view of the importance of Huangpu River transportation and the large number of citizens crossing the river, has determined that the existing privately-run ferries have simple equipment and pose a safety risk. In order to ensure traffic safety and convenience, the City Government has stipulated that matters concerning river crossings within the city should be handled by the city. Over the past few years, the City Public Ferry has opened four river-crossing routes. Among them, the river-crossing route between Dinghai Bridge in Puxi and Qingning in Pudong, although not heavily used by passengers, is a crucial hub for transportation between Shanghai and Chuansha. Therefore, the City Public Ferry opened the route there, and the ferry and dock facilities were not made simpler due to lower business. Thus, the total investment is still over 100,000 yuan. Calculated solely based on the route's business, losses have reached 40,000 to 50,000 yuan in recent years. If the City Public Ferry had not used profits from other routes to subsidize it, transportation there would have been impossible to maintain. Privately-run businesses are only interested in profit, and everyone competes for better routes, while less desirable routes are ignored, which is not conducive to regulating transportation. How well the City Public Ferry is managed is a matter of public opinion. As for the Dongjiadu area, ferry operators only know how to make profits and overload passengers, which is needless to elaborate on. In July of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), when the City Public Ferry was still under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau, the original private ferries in Dongjiadu were ordered to be shut down, and the City Public Ferry was ordered to proceed as quickly as possible. At the same time, according to successive letters from all sectors, there were also requests for quick action. In February of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the City Government ordered the Xingye Trust Company to actively prepare. However, the general ferry operators in Dongjiadu repeatedly petitioned the City Government and various bureaus, all of which were rejected. The ferry operators, led by women, blocked the construction of the revetment project on both sides of the Huangpu River and drove stakes in front of the City Public Ferry dock in Pudong. In November, they sued the manager of the Xingye Trust Company in court and distributed leaflets. Regarding the future livelihood of the original private ferry operators after the City Public Ferry opened, the City Government had already taken this into consideration. Previously, the Xingye Trust Company had submitted a plan to the City Government for cooperating with the ferry operators, but it was deemed inconsistent with the city's consistent policy of operating the City Public Ferry, and management would be particularly difficult, so it was not approved. The company has now been ordered to draft another relief plan so that genuine ferry operators can all receive actual benefits. In addition to convening a meeting of ferry operator representatives to discuss practical relief measures, the Xingye Trust Company has been ordered to begin operations by a deadline to ensure safety and meet the expectations of all parties.</p>

It was originally scheduled to be publicly displayed at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, but the venue was too small to display them all, so the Fangsheng Bureau in Lujiabang, Nanshi, has been selected to set up more than 200 reed mat sheds. The opening is scheduled for the 4th of this month, and representatives from all walks of life will be invited to attend the ceremony to encourage citizens to purchase enthusiastically, publicize, announce to the citizens, and broadcast speeches.</p>
<h3>French Concession's Newly Established Cattle and Sheep Transit Tax; Industry Association Opposes; Petition to the Chamber of Commerce and Others to Negotiate Cancellation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association, regarding the report that the French Concession's Municipal Council has newly established a cattle and sheep transit tax, has sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, requesting them to forward a letter to the French Municipal Council to cancel it quickly, and petitioning the French Municipal Council to withdraw its decision in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, etc.:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of requesting a referral. According to the Shanghai newspapers of December 30 of this year, the French Concession Municipal Council has newly established a cattle and sheep transit tax. All cattle and sheep passing through the border must pay taxes starting from January 1936, according to the Western calendar. The French Concession slaughterhouse has always charged one yuan for each slaughtered cow. The industry believes that the slaughterhouse is a public institution, and its facilities and various expenses depend on fees to maintain it, so there is no objection. However, regarding the transit tax, not only has there never been such a case, but there is no reason for it. What losses does the French Concession suffer from cattle and sheep passing through the border? If it is said that they trample on the roads, then taxes should be collected. Then in the future, pedestrians passing through the border will also often be taxed. What kind of law is this? Moreover, at this time of economic depression, it is well known that businesses and citizens are operating with difficulty. How can the French Concession Municipal Council bear to set up new names and collect unreasonable taxes from businesses and citizens? Although the transit tax has not yet been implemented, the report should be a fact. The colleagues of our association are determined to oppose the realization of this fact. We respectfully request that your associations forward a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council to cancel this regulation quickly, in order to clarify the law and relieve the difficulties of businesses. It is a public feeling. Respectfully presented to the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession.</p>
<p>To the French Municipal Council:</p>
<p>Regarding the petition to cancel the cattle and sheep transit tax in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. Upon reading the Shanghai newspapers of December 30, we learned that your council has newly established a cattle and sheep transit tax. All cattle and sheep passing through the border must pay taxes starting from January 1936, according to the Western calendar. The French Concession slaughterhouse has always charged one yuan for each slaughtered cow. The industry believes that the slaughterhouse is a public institution, and its facilities and various expenses depend on fees to maintain it, so there is no objection. However, regarding the transit tax, not only has there never been such a case, but there is no reason for it. What losses does the French Concession suffer from cattle and sheep passing through the border? If it is said that they trample on the roads, then taxes should be collected. Then in the future, pedestrians passing through the border will also often be taxed. Moreover, at this time of economic depression, it is well known that businesses and citizens are operating with difficulty. We respectfully request that your council be mindful of the difficulties of businesses and quickly withdraw this cattle and sheep transit tax in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. It would be a great kindness. Respectfully presented to the French Concession Municipal Council of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Tian Dan's Mortgage Dispute; Xu Qizhong is Innocent; Plaintiff Wang Bingzhong's Lawsuit is Dismissed</h3>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of Xu Guannan, residing at 61 North Zhejiang Road, mortgaged three Tian Dan title deeds to Wang Bingzhong, a Portuguese residing at 28 Lane 424, Foch Road, for 40,000 yuan in foreign currency on May 22 of this year due to urgent needs. Wang later discovered that the title deeds were forged and reported to the police station, who dispatched detectives to Hangzhou, arrested Xu Qizhong, brought him to Shanghai, and sent him to the First Special Court. After two investigations, Xu was ordered to pay a 40,000 yuan guarantee to leave. All these details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, this case was scheduled for a continuation hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court with their lawyers. Police lawyer Zhang [omitted]yin stated that the case was being rescheduled. The police station had been instructed to reinvestigate the Shanghai Bank branch on Avenue Joffre. Manager Pan reported that on May 25, someone had used a check for 1,600 yuan, number (3135601), to withdraw money from the bank. However, the check had been recovered by the victim Wang Bingzhong. When questioned, Xu Qizhong stated, "I had borrowed more than 1,000 yuan from Wang before May 21. On May 22, I borrowed another 1,600 yuan. Wang gave me a check at that time, and I personally withdrew the money from the Shanghai Bank on May 25. Therefore, I borrowed a total of 3,220 yuan, not 40,000 yuan. The Tian Dan title deeds are not mine either." Wang Bingzhong then stated that the check for 1,600 yuan was indeed issued by him, but it was for his own use and was not given to the defendant. He further stated, "I am indeed Portuguese and have obtained a certificate of ex-nationality from the Ministry of Interior." At this point, the court determined that the facts were clear and ordered the start of the debate. Under the debate between the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyer, and the statement by Wang's lawyer to file an additional private suit requesting the defendant to repay, Judge Liu Yudu reviewed the testimony and ruled Xu Qizhong not guilty and dismissed the plaintiff's lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Monk You Ming of Mount Putuo Certainly Committed Adultery; Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</h3>
<p>You Ming, the abbot of Faru Monastery on Mount Putuo, was previously framed by rogue Qiu Zhongyuan and the fugitive Zhang A'yuan, who colluded with Yong woman Wang Zhang-shi's (aka Dai Zhang-shi) daughter Wang A'mei (aka Dai A'wei), using Wang A'mei as a "honey trap" to extort You Ming. When the extortion failed, Qiu and others further forced You Ming to take nude photos with Wang A'mei and took them to the Dongfang Hotel to force You Ming to write a promissory note and extort money. Afterwards, You Ming returned to the mountain and told the Buddhist Association, which reported it to the Ben Tang abbot, who reported it to the French police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Qiu, Wang Zhang-shi, and Wang A'mei and brought them to the Second Special Court, which filed a public prosecution. The result of the trial was that Qiu was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 400 yuan. Shao Rui-kang (a clerk at the Laotiancheng Medicinal Material Store on Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen), the husband of Wang A'mei, learned of this and filed a complaint with the criminal division of the Second Special Court, suing Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang Zhang-shi, Wang A'mei, and others for offenses against public morals and the family. During the trial, Shao verbally requested to add a charge against monk You Ming for offenses against the family. The official ruled that a formal complaint had to be supplemented, or a separate lawsuit could be filed. The result of the trial of Shao's lawsuit was that it was deemed not to conform to litigation procedures and was ruled inadmissible. All these details have been reported in previous newspapers. Recently, Shao Rui-kang learned that his wife Dai A'wei, aka Wang A'mei, was indeed having an affair with monk You Ming and living at 2 Zhaofu Lane, Lafayette Road. He presented evidence and filed a complaint with the criminal division of the Second Special Court, suing You Ming for offenses against public morals and the family, requesting legal action. The court summoned him according to the complaint. The first hearing could not be held because the defendant You Ming had returned to Mount Putuo and could not be summoned. After the court sent a document to the Putuo Mountain jurisdiction, requesting them to assist in the summons, the defendant You Ming came to Shanghai and complied with the summons for questioning. He admitted to having an adulterous relationship with the plaintiff's wife, Wang A'mei, and presented the previous lawsuit against Qiu Zhongyuan and others for extortion as a defense. The case was repeatedly investigated by Judge [omitted] of the Second Special Court, and Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang Zhang-shi, Wang A'mei, and the landlord of 2 Zhaofu Lane were summoned to the case for interrogation. The court concluded that the defendant monk You Ming had indeed committed adultery and ordered him to post bail. Yesterday morning, at around 9 AM, the sentence was announced. You Ming was sentenced to three months in prison for adultery with a married person, and the other charges were acquitted. The defendant remained on bail during the appeal period. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present to hear the verdict. The defendant, upon hearing the prison sentence, silently prayed and complained of injustice. It is reported that the defendant's side expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and will file an appeal after receiving the written judgment.</p>
<h3>Female Gangster Lu Laoqi Sentenced to Prison; Two Years Imprisonment and a Fine of 1,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>The famous female gangster Lu Laoqi, aka Wenying, from Nanxiang in the local area, is 35 years old this year. She previously ran a salted meat store brothel at 114 Ailaige Road, Chujiaqiao, in the French Concession. Because of the case of Shao Wenbin, aka Ma Fu A'liu, a member of the Huahui Danchang and Huahui Tongmen gangs, being assassinated on the night of July 28 of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), and two other cases, including the suspected instigation of the biting woman, the French police station requested the Second Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. Lu then closed the brothel and disappeared. It was not until 9 PM on December 5 of last year that Lu was captured by French and Chinese detectives at 5 Yuren Lane, Yunnan Road, in the Public Concession, brought back, and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation and detention. There was no active evidence of instigating murder, but she admitted to having gathered people to open a "telephone" (gambling den) for the Huahui gambling part. Therefore, the French Police Department filed a public prosecution for gambling under Article 268 of the Criminal Code, and no prosecution was filed for the murder case. After repeated investigations by Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu, Lu was defended by a lawyer, and the debate was concluded, and a date was set for sentencing. Lu was ordered to pay a 6,000 yuan guarantee to be available for summons. Later, her family asked Xie Tingxin, a fellow villager and the owner of Yongfengtai South Goods Store at Xinqiaokou, Caishi Street, to be responsible for guaranteeing her release. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the sentencing date arrived. At around 10 AM, Presiding Judge Wang arrived at Criminal Division One to announce the sentence. The defendant Lu Laoqi, aka Wenying, arrived on time. After the court briefly questioned her age and background, it announced the sentence. Lu Wenying was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1,500 yuan for jointly intending to profit from gathering people for gambling. If the fine is converted to labor service, the conversion rate for one day shall be determined in proportion to 1,500 yuan and six months. During the appeal period, the defendant remained on the original bail.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fraud Cases Occur Frequently; Another Case of Fraudulently Establishing a Business to Defraud Goods; Four Accomplices Set Up Three Businesses and Dozens of Others; the Amount of Fraudulent Goods Reached Thousands of Yuan; One Suspect, Bi Haoan, Was Arrested, and the Remaining Suspects Are at Large</h3>
<p>Recently, a general fraud gang has appeared in Shanghai, specializing in organizing smooth-talking businesses to defraud commercial goods. The Public Concession police have successively cracked down on Yuyu Yong, Shunchang, Yuchanglong, Qia [omitted], Yi [omitted] and other businesses, as well as the Yusheng Bank. The number of criminals arrested is no less than dozens, and they have all been reported in this newspaper. Now, another similar case has occurred. The fraudulently established businesses are Xiangkang, Yi Gong Shen Zhuang. The details of the cracking of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Ningbo man named Bi Haoan previously joined Wang Heming, Zhang Amao, Hu Yongyu, and others to organize a smooth-talking business to defraud money and property, but they had no capital. Hu Yongyu raised 300 yuan, and they opened the Xiangkang business at 5 Jifu Lane, Ningbo Road, with Wang Heming as the manager, Hu Yongyu as the accountant, and Bi and Zhang as runners. After operating for about half a month, the amount of goods defrauded was not small, so they closed Xiangkang and reopened Qin Kang, Yi Gong Shen Zhuang at 74 Wuhu Road, and the positions of Wang and Hu were switched, repeating the same trick. The number of businesses defrauded was no less than dozens, and the value of the goods reached thousands of yuan. Because they were discovered, they were reported to the Old Gate police station, and Chinese detectives Liu Shaotian and Zhu Shanghe went to arrest them. All the criminals had already fled upon hearing the news. Later, Bi Haoan was arrested in Room 216 of the Dongan Hotel on Guangdong Road and brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division Two of the First Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation and prosecuted him for defrauding property under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. He also said that the current victims who reported to the police station included Yongcheng Weaving Factory, Xinguang Thermos Factory, Tongxing Stationery Company, Lichang Electrical Supply Store, Huamei Hat Factory, Hefeng Socks Factory, Hengtai Xiang Wood Comb Store, etc. The types of goods defrauded were woolen cloth, thermos bottles, ink, electrical materials, hats, etc. The defendant has fully confessed to the police station and has a confession, which should be judged according to law. He then presented the confession to the court. Subsequently, the victims submitted descriptions of their experiences of being defrauded. Judge Dai Rongduo questioned the defendant Bi Haoan and ordered him to be detained for further investigation and rescheduling.</p>
<h3>Case of Being Sued by a Concubine for Offending Public Morals: Yi Fangshuo Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo from Hangzhou, the head of the Jing Shen Troupe which performs humorous songs, dances, and dramas, has unfortunately had many domestic troubles. Last year, he was first accused of rape by his cousin Yi Baozhu and arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. The Law Enforcement Department found that Yi had also committed the crime of buying a woman to learn drama and monitoring her actions, so he was prosecuted for three crimes: offending public morals, disrupting family, and restricting personal freedom. After the trial, the part about offending public morals was dropped due to the withdrawal of the accusation. He was only sentenced to three years imprisonment for restricting personal freedom, and was found not guilty of disrupting the family. He repeatedly appealed, and the Supreme Court sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial this autumn, where he was finally found not guilty and released on bail, regaining his freedom. However, the Third Prosecutor's Office was still not satisfied with the retrial judgment and appealed. After Yi was released, his concubine Yi Didi, also known as Pei Yindi (25 years old, from Changzhou, previously mistakenly reported as from Suzhou), had a disagreement with Yi and demanded to end their relationship, but a satisfactory resolution could not be reached. Yindi then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Yi Fangshuo of two crimes: offending public morals and restricting personal freedom. Yi Fangshuo received the summons and also hired a lawyer to defend himself. Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court held a hearing on December 26th, summoning both parties for questioning. He announced the end of the debate and set a date for the verdict, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the verdict. Neither party nor their lawyers appeared in court. At 3 PM, Judge Li announced the verdict in the First Criminal Court: Yi Fangshuo was found not guilty.</p>

<h3>Tianli Liquefied Gas Products Factory to Hold Opening Ceremony Today; Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang Invited from Home and Abroad to Preside</h3>
<p>The Tianli Liquefied Gas Products Factory, founded by Shanghai industrialist Wu Yun-chu, will hold its opening ceremony today at 3 PM. Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang will preside, and guests from home and abroad have been invited to attend. For the convenience of the guests, the factory has prepared several special cars to pick them up at Jing'an Temple at 2 PM today. It is also reported that special balloons will be released before the opening to entertain the guests. Details of the factory's preparations and equipment are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process: Chemist Wu Yun-chu has a great enthusiasm for promoting basic industries. In recent years, recognizing the lack of industrial raw materials in China, he has devoted his life to the research and manufacture of basic chemical raw materials. In 1930, he established the Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, producing hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, bleaching powder, etc., with great success. Subsequently, recognizing the importance of liquefied gas industry in basic industry and national defense, he resolutely presented a proposal to the Military and Political Department in September 1933 to establish a liquefied gas factory. In October of the same year, he began to raise shares, with a capital of one million yuan. Within a few days, all shares were subscribed. In January 1934, he purchased dozens of acres of land at Chenjiadu, west of Zhoujiaqiao on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai, as the factory site. In February of the same year, construction of the factory buildings began. The ammonia factory machinery arrived in Shanghai in April, and the nitric acid factory machinery arrived mostly in November. The entire factory was completed successively in 1935. In September of the same year, liquid ammonia and ammonium chloride were shipped. In October, diluted nitric acid was shipped. In November, concentrated nitric acid was shipped. All products are of pure quality, surpassing foreign goods. Therefore, in October of the same year, the Ministry of Finance specially ordered all nitrate mining bureaus to instruct factories in various provinces to purchase them. In November, the Military and Political Department ordered all arsenals to purchase them, and the Ministry of Industry granted the factory exclusive manufacturing rights within the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Factory Building: The factory covers an area of more than 40 acres. All factory buildings are constructed with reinforced concrete and steel bars. All sides are made of glass windows, with ample light. All safety and sanitation equipment is quite complete. Among them, the gas storage tanks are large and numerous, and extremely magnificent. All piping inside the building is distinguished by various colors. The acid towers and concentration chambers in the nitric acid factory are innovations pioneered by the Chinese industry.</p>
<p>Equipment Overview: The factory is divided into two sections: ammonia factory and nitric acid factory. All the machinery of the ammonia factory was ordered from the most famous DuPont chemical factory in the United States. The machinery of the nitric acid factory was ordered from the famous French factory Kuhlmann. All machinery is made of special pressure-resistant or acid-resistant steel.

<h3>One-Year-Old Infant Dies Tragically from Coal Poisoning; Mother Slightly Poisoned and Rescued; Those Who Burn Coal Balls Should Be Cautious</h3>
<p>Sun Fusheng, 25 years old, from Taicang, runs a leather shoe business. His wife, Gong, lives with him in a pavilion room at No. 88 Hengji Lane, Gordon Road. They have a son named Huiming, who is just one year old. Tragically, around 10 PM the night before, while Sun was out, Gong was feeling cold, so she lit a coal ball stove in the room and closed the windows tightly for warmth. She then held her child and lay down to sleep. Little did she know that the coal gas could not escape, causing both mother and child to be poisoned by coal gas. Fortunately, Gong's poisoning was slight, so she only felt slightly dizzy. When Sun returned home at midnight and knocked on the door for a long time, Gong got up to open the door. However, the child's poisoning was already severe, and he lost consciousness. Sun immediately took the child to the nearby Red Cross for treatment, but the hospital had no doctors on duty at that late hour. They then went to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and the child died. The hospital reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They took the child's body to the autopsy room on Ferron Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the autopsy room to examine the body. According to the testimony of the child's father, Sun Fusheng, the deceased boy, Huiming, died of coal poisoning.

<h3>Municipal Government Issues Order to Implement Cemetery Reform Measures; Private Cemeteries Will Not Be Allowed After Next Year; Violators Will Be Fined One to Five Yuan Per Year</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior, recognizing that the construction of graves and tombs by the people is unrestricted, and has a significant impact on land production, has specially drafted the General Outline of Cemetery Reform Measures, and has notified all provinces and cities to follow the public cemetery regulations, select appropriate locations, establish public cemeteries, and prohibit the establishment of private cemeteries in fertile fields near cities, towns, and villages in the future, to gradually improve the situation. After receiving the notification, the municipal government has ordered its subordinates to comply.

The number of public cemeteries in each city, town, and village must be determined by the population of the city, town, and village. The location of each public cemetery should be a suitable distance from the city, town, or village, neither too close nor too far. The methods for raising funds for the land used for each public cemetery are: 1. If there is suitable public land or government property, there is no need to raise additional land, and it should be used as much as possible. 2. If there is no public land or government property, a location with a cheaper land price and a higher elevation should be selected and acquired at the market price. 3. The methods for raising funds for the land price of each public cemetery are: A. If the city, town, or village already has public funds, there is no need to raise additional funds. B. If there are no public funds, a loan must first be obtained from a bank or the county government, and it should be repaid in installments by levying taxes based on the amount of grain in the city, town, or village. The maximum area of each public cemetery cannot exceed ten acres. If there are too many burials and it is insufficient, another one must be established. The land in each public cemetery that has not been buried must continue to be cultivated with crops. After a new tomb is buried, there must be no raised grave mounds, and it must be level with the ground. New tombs are allowed to have steles or trees planted. The direction of the new tombs must be consistent as much as possible, and the order must not be chaotic. New tombs must have an appropriate distance, neither too far nor too close. The land that has been buried must be planted with flowers, plants, and trees, striving for solemnity and beauty. All ownerless abandoned graves in each city, town, and village must be leveled. The size of all existing graves with owners in each city, town, and village must be reduced as much as possible. The maximum diameter must not exceed three feet. From January 1, 1936, private cemeteries will no longer be allowed, and all burials must be in public cemeteries. If a private cemetery is established, a fine of one to five yuan per grave per year will be imposed.</p>

Minli lost to the Public Works Bureau last week, so their strength is weaker than Dongya's. The schedule for this week is listed below:</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Public and Private Middle Schools: Winter Break Still According to Regulations - Classes Continue as Usual, Exams Being Held - Zhejiang Education Department Cables Education Ministry</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, regarding the start and end dates of the winter vacation for secondary and higher schools in various provinces and cities this year, the Ministry of Education had issued a general order to local education authorities to make changes based on local conditions. Currently, all public and private schools in the province are following the school's regular regulations, continuing classes as usual. Also, as the school's semester exams are being held on schedule, and the teaching of each subject is coming to a close at the planned stage, the winter break dates will remain as stipulated. The Department has also cabled the Education Ministry to clarify this.</p>
<h3>Municipal Middle Schools' Winter Break Not Advanced</h3>
<p>In this city, the private middle schools previously received instructions from the Education Bureau to start the New Year's holiday early, and have all complied. Now, the Education Bureau has received an order from the Education Ministry, notifying all public and private middle schools that they may decide on their own whether to advance the winter break or not. However, the five municipal middle schools, Jingye, Wuben, Xinlu, Wusong, and Yangjing, have been ordered by the Education Bureau to continue classes and exams as usual on January 6th after the New Year's holiday, and the winter break will only begin on January 18th.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Strife Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The student strife at Zhejiang University, caused by students going to Beijing to petition the school authorities, has been ongoing for nearly two months. President Guo repeatedly cabled the Ministry to resign, and has been approved for a temporary leave of absence. He also instructed the Dean of the College of Agriculture, Li Deyi, to organize a school affairs meeting to temporarily maintain school affairs. The meeting has been organized and established, with Gong Pi Zheng Zonghai as chairman and Li Shouheng as vice-chairman. Three resolutions have been decided and students have been ordered to comply: 1. Students must not interfere in all school administration. 2. The patrol team must be dissolved. 3. Students of the College of Agriculture must return to the College of Agriculture to attend classes. The Student Union held a special meeting and resolved to fully accept the three resolutions. As of today (31st), students of the College of Agriculture have returned to the college to attend classes, the patrol team has been dissolved, and the school has fully returned to normal. However, the students' rejection of Guo, Li, and Xiong remains very firm. The overall order is quite good.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department Orders Maintenance of Education Business Tax</h3>
<p>The business tax of each county in the Jiangsu Province education budget, totaling 650,000 yuan annually, accounts for about one-sixth of the province's education expenses. Recently, a small number of counties, using self-funded business as an excuse, have resisted paying the business tax. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Finance Department and the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office jointly issued an order to the governments of the 61 counties in Jiangsu Province, which reads: "Regarding the joint order, the rice, flower, wood, bamboo, and other trades in each county have previously had disputes due to business relations. We have already issued instruction No. 20 of the Taxation Department to all trades. Some are complying, while others are watching. It must be understood that the business tax is designated for education, which is a very important matter. All rice, flower, wood, bamboo, and other trades that have traditionally paid business tax and obtained licenses must continue to do so according to custom and must not change their appearance or use self-funded business as an excuse to resist paying the business tax. The self-funded business portion should be subject to business tax and should not evade taxes or affect local tax revenue. This joint order is hereby issued, instructing the county governments to immediately inform each trade to comply in order to maintain tax administration. Be sure to do so."</p>

<h3>Children's Educational Novel – Little Men (1)(4)(1)</h3>
<p>— Original work by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The snake was indeed interesting, and later, chasing after a clumsy old crow and finally catching it occupied Tommo's time and mind. Therefore, he didn't think about his money at all until he was in bed that night, about to sleep.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, only Ned knows where it is," said the careless boy, and fell sound asleep, without worrying about the safety of his property.</p>
<p>The next morning, as the boys were about to start class, Tommo rushed into the classroom, panting, and asked:</p>
<p>"Everyone listen, who took my money?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" asked Fulang.</p>
<p>Tommo then explained everything, and Ned also clarified his words.</p>
<p>The others all declared that they knew nothing about it, and everyone's faces gradually became suspicious of Ned. The more he denied it, the more flustered and frightened he became.</p>
<p>"Someone must have taken it," Lang said. Tommo, waving his fist at everyone, angrily declared:</p>
<p>"I swear here today, the moment I catch that thief, I'll let him taste what my life is like."</p>
<p>"Be quiet, Tommo; we will find him. Thieves never end well," said Tang En, as if he knew something about it.</p>

Although the due date for interbank bills was two days, it was reported that there were over 3.8 million in transfers in the morning, over 400,000 in new transactions, over 300,000 in the afternoon market transactions, and over 600,000 in small general association transactions. Due to time constraints, bank collections could not be recorded in detail. Collection of foreign public single receipts by money houses amounted to over 64 million, and transactions of subsidiary currency were more active. In the morning market, 5000 jiao of Jiangnan small foreign currency and 165,000 jiao of Guangdong small foreign currency were traded. The dark market rate was 11 yuan, 4 fen, and 5 li, which was 2 li lower than the previous day. 42,000 strings of copper coins and 14,000 yuan of legal tender were traded.</p>
<p>In addition, the total number of bills at the city's clearing house was 8,219,301.34 yuan in national currency, including a total exchange of 7,096,794.96 yuan, and a total collection of 5,779,168.87 yuan by the money industry and 5,446,187.51 yuan by others. In addition, the joint reserve committee of the Shanghai Banking Association's public single lending rate was 10% per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate was 15% per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Under Various Circumstances, the Bond Market Passed Like This; Worthy of Admiration Are Only Speculators (?)</h3>
<p>The experience of the bond market in 1935 is quite memorable and is briefly described below for reference.</p>
<p>Domestic public bonds are a type of liquid asset, but their nature constantly changes with the environment, and market values often fluctuate. Moreover, because many of them are speculative, there are distorted, unreasonable actions, so they cannot last for long. There are quite a few people who are deceived by them for a while. Looking back on the past year, it is known that the cunning of speculators is truly astonishing. The magnitude of the changes last year almost fundamentally altered the market, which was unprecedented in previous years. Therefore, the total number of transactions for the year was more than 456 million yuan, meaning that monthly settlements totaled more than 52 million yuan. Trading was clearest in September and busiest in November and December. Market prices were relatively flat in the first half of the year and fluctuated the most in the second half of the year. The reasons and results in various aspects are briefly described separately below.</p>
<p>Regarding the economy: Since the end of 1934, a panic occurred in the financial world, with small banks and commercial firms going bankrupt one after another, and the social economy was in danger of collapse. The escape of cash was particularly alarming. Through the government's painstaking efforts and various forms of relief, the market experienced inflation, silver devaluation, and rumors of Sino-British or Sino-American loans. The market price of bonds relied on these factors to avoid falling. On November 4, the unification of the currency system was officially announced, and after the nationalization of cash, market prices soared. However, their level had already exceeded reason. In the winter, due to the North China issue and various obstacles by the Japanese, it was slightly impacted, and speculators took advantage of this to create further turbulence.</p>
<p>Regarding politics: In 1935, the Communists were gradually being suppressed, and politics showed signs of clarity. The nation had hopes for unification, which was rare in previous years. The results of the Sixth National Congress were particularly good, but the assassination of Premier Wang had some impact. Therefore, in terms of politics, it was natural for market prices to rise. After the North China issue arose, it was still difficult to predict whether political maneuvering could resolve the issue. However, there was hope that the issue of eastern Hebei could be resolved.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy: The most frightening diplomatic issue of the year was the Sino-Japanese relationship. There were various sporadic incidents in various provinces, which cannot all be listed, and the North China issue was particularly difficult. Knowing oneself and one's enemy made it easy to deal with. Chairman Chiang's diplomatic declaration summarized everything, and the bond market was given a major impulse.</p>
<p>Regarding speculators: The speculation throughout the year was truly enormous and extremely enthusiastic, causing people to be alarmed. There were two main aspects that were particularly concealed. During the spring, the customs revenue bonds of 1934, were pushed up to 95% of face value by bullish companies. At that time, there were confirmed reports that more than 20 million in spot goods had been recovered in the market, and the shorts were in a state of unprecedented panic. However, there was a major collapse shortly after, and the high and low market prices differed by more than 40 yuan in one month. This kind of speculation was only limited to one type of overfishing. Before and after the reform of the currency system in winter, large-scale bullish companies were discovered that used the notion of the omnipotence of legal tender to withdraw all the bonds or raise the market price to a combined interest rate of 8%. Even shorts were subjected to strict audits. This situation lasted for a month and a half, but it still turned downstream, and the various illusions turned out to be fleeting shadows. This kind of speculation was frighteningly dangerous, and its soul power was also admirable.</p>
<p>The above four situations are just a brief description of the major points. Although many bonds were issued in 1935, they were not traded on the market, so there was no risk of an extremely loose supply of chips in the market. The year passed mostly in this way. The changes were not many but extremely large, which had not been seen in recent years. The art of speculation became increasingly clever, and its scope became increasingly large. It can also be seen that commerce was in decline, and the existence of luck and speculation was increasing day by day, which is not a good phenomenon for the social economy.</p>
<h3>Major Players Continuously Selling Bonds — Retail Investors Rising Up to Cover Shorts —</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was the last trading day of 1935. Factors such as the Japanese intention to use Japanese currency clearly hindered the unification of our national currency, and the severe decline of American banks, which had yet to be reversed, and the rumors of bond interest rate cuts continued to circulate. Major players continued to sell, but because retail investors had a three-day holiday for the New Year, there were quite a few who covered their shorts. Therefore, after the market price fell once, it soon recovered. Forward rates remained weak and were unlikely to rally. The entire day saw larger declines in the morning market. The 20th Customs was suddenly down by 0.8 yuan, while only the 6th Whole Forward was up by 0.2 yuan. The second market saw a sudden rise, with the salt tax skyrocketing by 0.95 yuan. The two afternoon markets saw alternating rises and falls, mostly involving settlement and swap transactions. Sellers numbered 33, 48, and 54 continued their consistent policy, without giving up from beginning to end. The future was difficult to be optimistic about. As a result, market prices mostly recovered by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.5-0.6 yuan, but the 9th Customs Gold Short was down by 0.05-0.2 yuan. The total number of transactions was 19,610,000 yuan. The market will be closed for three days from New Year's Day to the 3rd. The results of the rises and falls are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Rose Across the Board</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market surged yesterday (December 30), with quite calm inflows and outflows. There were several spot transactions on the floor to immediately deliver goods in order to pay taxes. Small exchange stocks advanced under the leadership of public utility stocks. The bond market was calm. The total number of transactions for the day was 1.63 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Date | Dec 28 | Dec 30 | Change</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 140.77 | 143.00 | Up 2.23</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks | 39.39 | 40.02 | Up 0.63</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks | 28.69 | 19.35 | Up 0.66</p>
<p>40 Bonds | 98.32 | 98.42 | Up 0.2</p>
<p>11 Commodities | 56.52 | 57.08 | Up 0.56</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales of Yarn and Cotton Are Still Not Lonely</h3>
<p>Due to the year-end settlement, the yarn and cotton auction market was inactive. However, spot yarn transactions still saw some business. Customers also arrived to gather, and sentiment was good. Purchasing from the south, Yunnan, and Guangdong was increasingly healthy, and domestic buying interest was also strong. The overseas cotton industry situation remained stable, and the auction price was also in a fluctuating trend. The transaction statistics for the day for the various gangs showed 670 bales bought and sold, and the market was firm. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 245, Yunnan: 150, Mainland: 190</p>
<p>Shantou: 65, Fujian: 15, Wuhu: 5</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm. Shenxin Factory purchased 2,160 bales of Yaohua cotton and 51 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton: 3.10, Also: 3 pieces, Also</p>
<h3>High and Low Both Set New Records: Drastic Fluctuations in Cotton Yarn Prices – The Facts of the Year Twenty-Four</h3>
<p>A brief account of the changes in Gold Rooster Standard Futures and market conditions throughout the year Twenty-Four: In the spring months of January, February, and March, Mr. Wu and Tongcheng Company acquired goods, with market prices standing at 185.6 yuan. Subsequently, the Shanghai financial crisis surged, banks and money shops collapsed one after another, the situation was exceptionally severe, and finance was extremely tight. Spring sales were disappointing, and customer demand in the summer was even more subdued. Moreover, the floods in the northern routes caused the market to become increasingly unstable, plummeting in a straight line, breaking through two major barriers, from 80 yuan to 70 yuan. Furthermore, Japanese merchants took advantage of their cheap exchange rates to dump goods in our country's standard market, in huge amounts. Changfeng No. 1's inventory often held 15,000 to 16,000 bales. The unrest in the north further dampened morale. By July, under the impact of tight money, it broke the 60-yuan barrier, reaching a low of 158.9 yuan, setting a new record since the exchange was established. On August 1st, an additional auction of Japanese yarn for January delivery was held. During the peak autumn sales season of July, August, and September, a new force suddenly entered the market, absorbing and anticipating price increases. Moreover, due to difficult operations, several factories faced financial difficulties, announcing shutdowns, reduced work hours, and halted production, which became increasingly serious, gradually showing signs of recovery and a turnaround from adversity. Hengfeng Shenxin Factories No. 2 and 5 and Minsheng all completely shut down. Factories in various places such as Tianjin, Hankou, inland Wuxi, Changzhou, and Tongzhou in the north were all affected by the decline in cotton yarn prices and unanimously and voluntarily reduced work hours to maintain their factory foundations. Such a serious situation had not been seen in more than a decade. Nearly 50% of the nation's yarn spindles were shut down. As a result, market confidence was shaken, and the weak atmosphere of cotton yarn gradually dissipated, transforming from weakness to strength. The Changsha gang began purchasing, and they made every effort to buy the "Wealthy" 20-count yarn produced by the Hengfeng factory. Thus, the chips in the warehouse moved first, gradually decreasing from 9,000 bales to 5,000 bales. At the same time, margin calls rose sharply, and financial activities were very strong. From July 1st to the 29th, the price rose in a straight line from 160 yuan to 179.7 yuan, a rise of about 20 yuan. In August and September, due to the US cotton loan changing from a 12% discount to a 9% discount, the world cotton industry was shaken, and Osaka Sanpin yarn and Liverpool Indian cotton all declined, causing the yarn market to retreat, returning to the 70-yuan level. In September and October, with the tense situation in Italy and Abyssinia and the heavy atmosphere of war, flour and wheat first soared, and US cotton and Sanpin yarn all surged. As a result, people were excited, and it was rumored that margin calls were rising sharply. Rumors spread like wildfire in the market, saying that inflation was bound to occur, and people's enthusiasm reached a boiling point. The gold market saw an astonishing surge, breaking through three major barriers and the 1,200-yuan mark. The standard market could not cope, and speculators flocked in like swarms of bees. Gold shops, banks, and government bond merchants all rushed in, rising in a straight line from 72-73 yuan to 198 yuan. Japanese merchants, seeing the unfavorable environment, had no choice but to painfully close their positions. Changfeng's short positions reached 16,000-17,000 bales, all of which were cleared. Subsequently, on November 4th, the National Government reformed the currency system and implemented distribution, and morale became even more elevated. The market jumped horizontally by 10 yuan, and each month pierced through 200 yuan. The peak of the May contract saw 213.4 yuan, setting a new record since the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan. Later, as yarn sales slightly stagnated, Osaka Sanpin yarn fell from 212 yuan to within the 200-yuan level. Colleagues Mr. Wu, Mr. Bian, and Mr. Xu showed a tendency to sell because their prices had reached a high level and saw constant ups and downs. However, financial institutions and certain connected firms such as Jinchang, Changfeng, Gengfeng, Mingde, Dafu, Tongcheng Company, and Jinkang stubbornly held on, refusing to budge, showing the fierce competition between the bulls and bears. Recently, with the rise in gold bond prices, there was another round of appreciation. The May contract futures reached 211.8 yuan again. Later, because colleagues supplied sufficient spot goods and massively settled in the December contract, coinciding with the end of the year and sluggish real sales, the market price was slightly depressed by their threat. The year-end closing price was 197 yuan for the near-term contract and 206 yuan for the far-term contract, an increase of 12.5 yuan compared to the near-term closing price of 184.7 yuan in the 23rd year, and an increase of 16.7 yuan compared to the far-term closing price of 189.3 yuan. The total transaction volume of futures yarn for the year was 8,884,300 bales, a decrease of 1,595,200 bales compared to the previous year's 10,379,500 bales. Among them, the transaction volume in January was the lowest at 267,000 bales, and the transaction volume in October was the highest at 1,184,000 bales. The total number of delivered bales for the year was 64,450 bales, with the lowest delivery in August at 1,600 bales, the highest at 200 yuan for the December contract, and the lowest at 163 yuan for the June contract. The highest price for futures yarn was 202 yuan for the December contract, and the lowest was 158.9 yuan for the July contract. The following is a table listing the highest and lowest prices, delivery prices, delivery quantities, and transaction quantities for each month.</p>

<p>Futures Cotton – Short Positions of Sellers</p>
<p>Futures Cotton – Short Positions of Buyers</p>
<p>Worldwide Inventory of US Cotton Declines</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants Still Lean Towards Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was dull and stagnant. Both sides were settling positions due to the impending court decision. Initially, long positions were liquidated and Aolun sold, and later rebounded due to purchases from Liverpool and Mumbai. There were not many sellers in the market, and buyers were wary. According to observers, speculators leaned towards the short side. Finally, with the liquidation of long positions, it weakened again. The closing price was estimated to be up 5 points for spot goods and up 1 to 4 points for futures. According to an exchange survey, as of November 30th, the worldwide inventory of US cotton, including unpicked cotton, totaled 15,531,000 bales, compared to 16,342,000 bales in the same period last year and 13,456,000 bales in the same period the year before last. English cotton spot prices rose 3 points, and futures prices rose 2 points. The Indian cotton market was unremarkable, and then strengthened due to good news from Liverpool, estimated to be up 0.25 rupees for Pingguo, down 0.25 to 0.5 rupees for Aomula, and unchanged for Bailuoxi. Original telegram on the left (30th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 31st was 217.5 rupees, up 0.5 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Last Week's Cotton Exports from Rangoon</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram on the 30th, the total amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 9,162 bales, of which 5,800 bales were to Kobe, 1,000 bales to Osaka, 1,112 bales to Liverpool, and 1,10 bales to Dalian.</p>
<h3>Grains: Domestic Rice Weak, Imported Wheat Firm</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The supply from various gangs is increasingly scarce, arriving only on the 20th or so (totaling over 4,000 stones). The sales market is also sluggish due to the end of the lunar year. The price of thick early japonica rice has not changed, and only over 1,000 bags of thin grain rice were sold. Domestic and imported glutinous rice is flat, and Yinlian yuan shows a soft trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various routes below the river was on the 43rd and 44th days. White japonica rice in the market is being bought up by shops. Speculators are holding prices high. The market price for high-quality materials has been adjusted down a few corners, while medium-quality materials are short a few corners. Sales of thin rice are sluggish, and prices are peaceful. Guanbu glutinous rice is flat, and the price is weak. Baiyuan is stable. Prices for other goods are weaker than the previous market. Today, the Republic of China New Year's Day, business will be closed for two days, and business will resume as usual the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Client Warehouse) Market conditions: Both imports and exports are sluggish. Statistics show that only a few hundred bags were traded in the entire city. Prices are nominally stable but secretly discounted because the amount of goods arriving and in storage is sufficient, sales are sluggish, and people are not optimistic about the market. The amount of rice in client warehouses in the city totals over 200,000 bags, with half in the hands of merchants and half stored by speculators. Most of the goods are Jiangxi rice.</p>
<p>The global statistical position of overseas wheat is stronger than before. Canadian wheat exports have increased, and demand for flour during the New Year is improving. Last week, supplies were reduced by 613,000 bushels, and Canadian wheat supplies were reduced by 2,709,000 bushels.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan Prices Rise by Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Quanzhou dried longan: Recently, due to weak sales, prices for both new and old goods have started to fall. However, according to telegrams from the producing area yesterday, land prices suddenly increased dramatically, rising by as much as four yuan. It is likely that outside gangs are purchasing, and the inventory is also low.</p>
<h3>Metals: Chinese Copper Sheets Increase in Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai copper sheet market has long been controlled by Eastern goods. Although German and American goods have come to China, the quantity is not large enough to compete with them. Since the establishment of Chinese copper sheet factories, domestic hot water bottle factories, flashlight factories, toy factories, etc., have all abandoned Eastern goods and are happy to buy domestic goods. Therefore, in a corner of Shanghai, the sales market for Chinese copper sheets has been able to surpass Eastern goods. However, raw materials still need to be supplied by American goods (i.e., purple copper, white lead, etc.). Although China also produces yellow copper and white lead, the quality is relatively rough, and casting copper sheets is more difficult. Recently, the prices of imported purple copper and white lead have been increasing, so the price of Chinese copper sheets also has to be raised to protect capital. Therefore, the asking price has recently increased from 40 yuan to about 50 yuan. It is reported that transactions are still active, so the market is quite optimistic.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Galangal Harvest is Poor, New Goods are About to Arrive</h3>
<p>Galangal is one of the spices. Today, because the inventory is low, high-quality goods are priced at 19.5 yuan, and even worm-eaten inferior goods are priced at 14.5 yuan to 14 yuan. According to telegrams, this year's new goods have been reduced, and the market price is still difficult to predict. The first batch of only a dozen pieces has been purchased by a certain firm and is being packed and will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Woolen Cloth Business Ends Early</h3>
<p>The sales of woolen cloth have declined. Local customers have added few purchases, and the business of tailoring and Western clothing is now off-season. Prices have not been affected due to various reasons. Yesterday, most of the woolen cloth and Western clothing industry was busy collecting goods, and there was still a lot of incoming and outgoing goods. Most of the guild's operations have stagnated. Compared with previous years, the decline in woolen cloth transactions is more than ten days earlier, which is enough to see a glimpse of the market.</p>

<h3>China's Tea Industry (5)</h3>
<p>— Yi Bai</p>
<p>Second, Urgent Improvements Needed in Tea Management Organizations</p>
<p>A. Centralized Export</p>
<p>There are many tea factories in China, but their scale is very small, resulting in uneven exports and high costs. To seek the development of tea in international trade, it is not suitable for the large-scale demand of international standards, and Chinese tea merchants already bear a heavy burden. Not only that, because Chinese tea operators lack trade organizations, exports must go through layers of exploitation by tea merchants, tea firms, tea warehouses, tea compradores, foreign firms, etc., before they can reach the international market. If operators want to pass this burden on to consumers, they will inevitably raise prices, but there are teas in overseas markets that are priced lower than Chinese tea, which will inevitably lead to failure; however, if they do not want to pass it on to consumers, their own costs are too high, so how can China's tea industry not fail? To avoid this harm, there is no other way than to centralize exports. Centralized export has the following advantages: First, it can unify the quality of Chinese tea, avoiding suspicion by foreign consumers; second, the quantity of supply and demand can be balanced, avoiding the harm of oversupply or overdemand; third, the time and money to directly reach the international market are both economical, avoiding the layers of exploitation by those who make a living by selling, thus reducing costs relatively, lowering prices relatively, and facilitating trade.</p>
<p>B. Reduce Various Tea Taxes</p>
<p>The government and the people are one. Paying taxes is the natural duty of the people. However, when the people's lives are difficult, the government should not only not levy taxes but also help stabilize their lives. This is the duty that the government owes to the people and the fundamental meaning of the people paying taxes to the government. After all, the government cannot survive without a healthy national economy. According to the July 15, 1935, issue of the Shih Pao News: "The Ministry of Industry requested the Anhui Provincial Government to negotiate on behalf of the Qimen Tea Production and Sales Cooperative Federation to exempt tea donations for five years. The Anhui Provincial Government has now replied, limiting it to the seven cooperatives under the Qimen Tea Production and Sales Cooperative Federation." If the government believes that it can be exempted or reduced nationwide, then Chinese tea may have hope of revival. However, this is still not a particularly active relief policy. The best way is for the government to be responsible for centralizing the production and sales of tea nationwide, which would be more thorough and more promising.</p>
<p>In short, the above-mentioned points are all outlines. If they are implemented, experts will have to formulate detailed plans. What needs to be reiterated here is that Chinese tea is uniquely favored by nature, and its quality, especially green tea, cannot be matched by other countries. Therefore, if China works hard to improve the tea industry, the world market is still waiting for Chinese tea to gallop. (End)</p>

<h3>New Year's Greetings</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The happy New Year has arrived again amidst people's cheers. I must first wish everyone a happy New Year here!</p>
<p>Today I have a lot to say, but because I am too excited for a moment, I don't know where to start?</p>
<p>Now, let's write down a few things that come to mind as my New Year's dedication:</p>
<p>From a global perspective, this year is the so-called crisis year of 1936. We have already heard this warning, and we have also seen the major powers preparing their troops to deal with this future disaster. Now that this ominous year has really come, the emotions of all parties are even more tense, and they are watching the development of this crisis. Judging from the situation, the world situation is extremely dangerous today, and war is imminent. The catastrophe of mankind may be coming!</p>
<p>In China, this year is the National Goods Year for citizens. National Goods Years have been held twice in the past, namely the Women's National Goods Year and the Student National Goods Year. Although the implementation of these two National Goods Years did not achieve satisfactory results, on the one hand, due to the enthusiasm of the advocates, and on the other hand, due to the efforts and support of the people, there was still a considerable impact on the promotion of national goods. The annual import surplus of foreign goods in our country is very large, which is extremely painful. The way to remedy this is for the Chinese people to unanimously use domestic goods, and there is no other way to recover our rights and interests. Therefore, we, like ordinary citizens, will implement the use of domestic goods starting today, so that this year's National Goods Year can be even more outstanding than the past National Goods Years. Then the future of national goods will have considerable hope!</p>
<p>There are two other things in our country this year that are worth mentioning. According to the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session, the National Government has stipulated that the Constitution will be promulgated on May 5 of this year, and the National Assembly will be convened on November 12. These two events have long been desired by the people of the whole country, and now they are about to be realized, which is very gratifying. Let's quickly spread our arms and prepare to welcome our Constitution and National Assembly!</p>
<p>It is also necessary to mention in passing that everyone should not forget that this year is still Children's Year. The Children's Year in our country is stipulated to be from August 1 of last year to July 31 of this year. Therefore, today, a group of children, having both the New Year and Children's Year, have these two celebrations, and naturally they will be particularly happy!</p>
<p>I wish everyone a happy New Year!</p>
<h3>Chinese Films of the Twenty-Fourth Year</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>It's a good intention to settle the accounts for Chinese films of the twenty-fourth year. Not only is it timely, but also wouldn't it be quite meaningful to see what changes have occurred in Chinese films this past year? However, writing a good article under such a broad topic is simply impossible for me. Firstly, my talent and ability are insufficient to take on this important task. Secondly, although I usually have some clippings and notes, they are really too few to be sufficient for such a large topic. Thirdly…</p>
<p>Therefore, even before writing, I knew that at most I could only draw up a rough list under such a broad topic, providing Chinese film enthusiasts with an additional reference.</p>
<p>The twenty-fourth year was a poor year for the Chinese film industry. Every company was facing salary arrears to varying degrees (even after large-scale layoffs). Being in arrears for two or three months was considered fortunate. In the so-called "small companies," some were even in arrears for more than half a year, and it's still like a stone thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>The reason the film industry is so poor is naturally closely related to the endless cycle of external and internal natural and man-made disasters over the years. Movies are not daily necessities. In this time when people are struggling to make a living, the shrinking of the film market is a natural fact. On the other hand, due to the imperfect organization of the companies, the constant overheads were too high, and the output was very slow, which further trapped the company administration in a state of financial difficulty. As for the content of the productions, under the prevailing distorted system of screenwriting, directing, and stardom, the content of the productions was simply following the crowd, repetitive, and made people suspect they were all coming from the same mold. The authors only know what "type" of film can make money, so they cut and alter it all over again as their own work to cater to the market. They don't know to broaden their horizons to grab material from other corners, and they don't know to reflect reality through art. Their greatest ability is imitation and plagiarism.</p>
<p>Due to imitation and plagiarism, viewers, after growing tired of the cliché and repetition, have no choice but to turn away.</p>
<p>According to the statistics in the "Film World" section of the newspaper *Min Bao*, there were a total of forty-seven domestic films in the twenty-fourth year. But in fact, it is probably mistaken. For example, as far as I can remember, Datong Company's "Under Mount Emei" and Tianyi Company's "Grace of a Beauty" were not included, while "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours" seems to have been released last year. However, because I haven't kept good statistics myself, I can't be sure how many domestic films there were this year.</p>
<p>Among these forty-seven films (let's just rely on what "Film World" says), there are great differences in content and form. On the good side, there are "The Beginning of Man," "Nostalgia," "Escape," "Goddess of Freedom," "New Woman," "The Big Road," "Sea Burial," "Boatman's Daughter," "Hero of the Times," and so on, while there are also incomprehensible ones like "National Customs," "Mania," "Black Shadow," and so on. And between the good films and the good films, and between the incomprehensible films and the incomprehensible films, there are various differences. If we want to analyze these differences in detail, it is not something that this brief article can do. We can only abstractly say: Generally speaking, most of them are in line with the pulse of the times. Although because of film censorship, slogans against imperialism and anti-X are not allowed to be shouted, and other technicalities are subject to piecemeal restrictions (the decline of the film industry). The film industry still managed to reflect reality to a considerable extent, using "symbolic techniques" or "bright tails" to convey their grievances. Although precisely because of this, in addition to the sameness of subject matter, there was even more uniformity.</p>
<p>Under this so-called "limitation of the objective environment," what is more gratifying is the progress in the techniques of expressing content. Since Chinese films were awakened by the artillery fire of the January 28th Incident, the progress in performance has been the most obvious. And the general improvement of technology in the domestic films of the twenty-fourth year is even more obvious. This is not only the prominence of a certain film, but what is even more gratifying is the general improvement, enabling Chinese films to approach the international film scene.</p>
<p>Of course, form and content cannot be separated, and the so-called improvement in technique is only general, not universal. Besides the authors with an "artistic conscience," some, due to insufficient self-cultivation, still have works that haven't made much progress compared to the early Chinese films (especially "small companies," which are even more constrained by mechanical financial difficulties). Some, however, are going backward, giving distorted sermons to the audience.</p>
<p>In addition to this, what is even more distressing is that some merchants, unable to gain a foothold in the country, whose works are rejected by the audience, and also due to film censorship, flee overseas to Hong Kong to shoot supernatural films. The recent activity of supernatural films and costume historical films in Hong Kong (most of which are completely moving Cantonese operas to the screen) is the result of these merchants' activities.</p>
<p>However, the audience is progressing with the times. Weren't films like "Burning" also active in China for a while in the early days? Now they have finally been spurned by the progressive audience. Although the appreciation level of the general audience in South China is relatively low, we dare to believe that in a short period of time, supernatural films in South China will suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>In addition to the shameless merchants fleeing to South China (which can also be said to be being driven to South China), the loss of talent is also the most unfortunate thing this year. Ms. Ruan Lingyu, who was considered the best actress in China, committed suicide by taking poison on the great Women's Day. Mr. Nie Er, the author of emerging songs such as "The Big Road" and "Peach and Plum Calamity," also drowned in Japan. And Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, the pioneer of Chinese films, also died of illness in Shanghai in July. Tianyi Company's actors Lu Lixia, Ma Dongwu, and former Lianhua set designer Liu Jinsan also died one after another. In the same year, the departure of excellent director Shen Xiling and actress Xuan Jinglin from the film industry further added to the loss in the already barren film garden.</p>
<p>In contrast to the deaths and departures of filmmakers, there is the rise of new talents this year. Among the rising new talents, those who deserve attention and high hopes are: Diantong actors Lan Ping, Shi Chao, Lu Xiaming, directors Situ Huimin, Xu Xingzhi, Yuan Muzhi, etc. Especially Lan Ping, starting from the stage play "Nora," has attracted the great attention of film enthusiasts. Although so far, we have not seen her in a role that she can independently carry.</p>
<p>In addition, on the old-timer side, since "Hero of the Times" and "Family Happiness" were successively released, Shang Guanwu has also become the center of attention, and is a rare actor.</p>
<p>I think I'll stop my "rough list" of Chinese films of the twenty-fourth year here. On the other hand, I would also like to briefly talk about the activity of amateur dramatists and the decline of film criticism this year.</p>
<p>Starting from "Four Springs' Melody," amateur dramatists who went from the stage to the screen have performed several plays this year, such as "Nora" and "The Inspector General," which have added a lot of vitality to the silent drama movement.</p>
<p>Regarding amateur dramatists performing dramas, some people think that it will hinder the development of the film industry (mainly hindering the progress of work). But my opinion is not like that. I think that as long as it doesn't greatly hinder the progress of work (and in fact, it won't be too much of a hindrance), performing dramas not only invigorates the atmosphere of drama, and allows actors' acting skills to be cultivated to be more refined and exquisite, but also can eliminate bad habits in a negative way.</p>
<p>The decline of film criticism is similar to and related to the decline of the film industry this year. The biggest reason is also the inability to speak freely. The result of limited speaking is that it conceptually becomes formulaic. If it doesn't become formulaic, it becomes purely technical criticism. In this way, on the one hand, it is separated from society, and on the other hand, it goes down an even more specialized and difficult path.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned unconscious errors, some are full of jokes due to their own insufficient cultivation, while others are even more sinister and make people afraid to think deeply.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Old Days of the New Year</h3>
<p>— Ying Guangjun</p>
<p>Celebrating the New Year was really the happiest thing in my childhood. At that time, I would put on new clothes, shoes, socks, and hats were completely new, turning myself into a new person, preparing to celebrate the New Year. When celebrating the New Year, I can't forget the good things at that time: my mother would give me some money, and I could spend it outside as I pleased, so when I saw the candy peddlers, peanuts, melon seeds, pears, and small beds, I wouldn't be embarrassed like I usually was, having not a penny in my pocket. I would take out one or two small coins and exchange them for some food. What child doesn't like to eat snacks? Sometimes when guests came, they would leave a few "lucky money," and I would cry and shout to my mother to ask for it, and I wouldn't leave until I got it. Because what my mother used to say, "Save it and keep it for later use," had become a dishonored check. Facts and experience had long proved that my mother took the money and hid it all away, and never took it out for use again.</p>
<p>The New Year probably has a lot of new sights, but it was very disappointing in my hometown, because the climate was too unhelpful. The New Year we are talking about now should be considered a truly "new" year. The New Year I spent as a child, whether in terms of time or the current name, was all a "old" year. The New Year that has passed is of course an "old" one. The New Year in the past was the lunar New Year, which is what we now call the old year, so of course it should also be considered "old". In my hometown, whenever we celebrated the New Year, it was in the middle of winter, with snow covering the ground and freezing weather. We wouldn't see a sunny day for ten days or half a month. Except for the white-walled mountains and rivers that caught the eye, we couldn't see the green fields, green trees, and the earth in its natural color - so what new sights were there! It was completely lifeless! If you spat on the snow, it would freeze into ice. If you stretched out your hand, your fingers would freeze stiff. The weather had already concealed the new sights. Fortunately, people who were used to the climate and familiar with the cold didn't care about that, so they often formed groups of three or five and went to skate on the frozen river surface. They would stick firecrackers firmly on the surface of the ice and set them off. Sometimes they would slip and fall, getting covered in white snow, which would cause everyone to laugh. Setting off firecrackers was</p>
<h2>Page 32</h2>
<p>a joyous event for children during the New Year. How captivating that crisp sound was! Knowing that it was a dangerous toy, they were willing to approach it, play with it, and everyone</p>
<p>also judged your courage and weakness based on your ability to set off firecrackers!</p>
<p>It can't be said that there were no new sights at all in the New Year in my hometown. In addition to the fact that people's clothes were fresher and cleaner than usual, things like pasting Spring Festival couplets, door gods, hanging money, and large red cloths with incense sticks and paper were all new. Even those couplets with "New Year's auspiciousness," "Look up and see joy," "Five grains in abundance," and "Continuous promotion of three grades" were so fresh! Even the cats and dogs seemed more active and fresh than usual.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I most looked forward to the New Year. Having new things to see was certainly one of the reasons, such as singing Yangko, playing dragon lanterns, and stepping on stilts. In addition, the food was particularly richer than usual, which was really a reason for people to be joyful and eagerly look forward to. On ordinary days, the food at home was very bad. Although good dishes and rice were served when guests came, the children didn't get a share. Although they were dissatisfied in their hearts, they couldn't dissuade them, so they could only hope for the New Year for all the dissatisfaction with the food. At home, the New Year lasted from New Year's Day until after the Lantern Festival, and this period was truly an unforgettable "golden age".</p>
<p>In fact, starting from December 23rd - what my hometown called the Little New Year - we were already celebrating the New Year by changing the food. Until the end of the month was the "busy New Year period." Making tofu, steaming steamed buns, slaughtering pigs, butchering sheep, filling incense sticks, and pasting Spring Festival couplets were all done in these few days. The New Year was celebrated for more than twenty days.</p>
<p>When I think back to the New Year I spent as a child, there are often things that make me laugh non-stop, but now I can never get them back. As for how the people in my hometown have been celebrating the New Year in recent years, whether I have been celebrating two New Years, and whether my economic ability still allows them to eat and drink as happily as before, I don't know at all now.</p>
<p>I guess that about nine out of ten people in my hometown are unhappy during the New Year now.</p>
<h3>Closing the Shop</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>After lunch, the shop was full of...? People asking for debts? They were all shop assistants from various visiting customers, with iron faces, and always speaking with scolding voices. Some were even banging on the table, as if they were going to fight my mother. Because of the slack business in the shop, my father had the intention of closing it down during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but it was the custom in the countryside that the accounts that were sent out could not be recovered until the end of the year, and the accounts that were owed to others had to be paid off if the shop was open. Now there were still three days until the end of the year, but after the news of my father's decision to close down spread, those who wanted to collect debts were afraid that we would run away, and the shop was full of those iron-faced shop assistants every day after lunch. My father went out early every morning to chase after debts, and didn't return to the shop until midnight. Originally, the end of the year was the busiest time for business in the shop. In previous years, we always had to temporarily hire a shop assistant to help, and the task of collecting debts was also assigned to my second uncle. My father, a shop assistant, my mother, and I would help a little. At noon, we sometimes couldn't cope with the customers who came to the shop. Although the countryside was small, people always had to buy some goods for the New Year, and going to the city to buy goods cost a shipping fee, and they couldn't return that night. Our small grocery shop was entrusted by them in advance to go to the city to purchase goods and earn a little commission, so the business was always able to make ends meet. But this year, because my older brother was studying in the city, my second uncle moved to the city to live. My second uncle was my father's right-hand man. My maternal grandfather also passed away in the summer, and my mother's family only had my maternal grandmother. My mother was worried about her and often went back to her house to live. The shop was usually run by my father alone. If we hired a shop assistant all year round, my father thought it was too uneconomical. After discussing it with my second uncle several times, he decided to close the shop and move to the city to live as well. But outsiders didn't know the inside story. As soon as the news of the closure spread, those who owed debts refused to pay, but those who wanted to collect debts tried their best to collect them. My father was busy for more than half a month, but most of the time he ran around for nothing. Their excuses were always to pay off the debts by the end of the year, and the accounts that were recovered were always insufficient to pay off the debts that were owed to others. My mother never cared about the money coming in and going out of the shop. My mother could only discuss with those shop assistants who were roaring with scolding voices in a friendly manner. But it was always unreasonable to close the shop at this time. The more friendly we discussed with them, the more they thought we didn't have money to pay off the debts. Some rude shop assistants even wanted to check our money counter and confiscate our bottom goods as compensation. I was regarded as a child by them, and I really couldn't say anything. My mother had no choice but to spread out the account books and let them settle the accounts. It took a lot of effort to explain to them one by one as they left, but they still didn't trust us and said that we were keeping false accounts. Why would we close the shop if we had such good business?</p>
<p>The business was naturally gone. People are so snobbish that even neighbors and relatives would rather take a boat to the city to buy goods. "Closing the shop at this time of year is always unpopular!" My father was always complaining these days. "If people owe people clearly, I can still open such a shop!" But what's the use? He runs around every day, but the accounts he gets back are not enough to cover the debts. It was also raining continuously, and my father came back to the shop every day covered in mud. He threw the bag (the money bag for collecting debts) on the counter, and he almost fell into the shop, leaning on it for a long time before he regained the courage to calculate today's accounts. My mother was making noodles and washing feet, and frowned and said;</p>
<p>"First borrow some money from my second uncle to pay off the debts, and slowly collect the debts that people owe after the New Year! It's really not easy to open a shop!"</p>
<p>My father glanced at her and replied with a bitter smile: "It's not easy to open a shop? It's because we don't open a shop. Do you remember such a situation in previous years? The accounts that were released were all paid off by the twenty-fifth or sixth day of the lunar month, and even if the debts that were owed were late until the thirtieth night of the lunar year, no one would come to the door with a lantern! Closing the shop at this time of year is always unpopular! It's as if I'm going bankrupt, huh, these people!" My father looked at me standing there blankly, and stroked my hair and said, "Remember, go to the city to study hard with your older brother, and you don't have to open any shop in the future. A high school graduate can be worth a 'juren' in the former Qing Dynasty!"</p>
<p>As he said that, he smiled. This was my father's hope, but the hope was ultimately in vain. Until now, after my father's death, I graduated from university, and my mother and I are living a more difficult life than when the shop was closed. When I deal with each year's end, I can't help but think of the scene of closing the shop ten years ago. The iron faces of those roaring creditors are floating in front of me one by one again.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the New Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>At six o'clock, the quitting bell in the workshop rang, and the mournful sound of rotating and rubbing steel gears suddenly stopped. Zhang A'kui took off his tattered coat from the pillar, followed his partners out of the workshop, held his hunting cap in his hand, and didn't even go to the tiger stove to wipe his face and wash his hands, nor did he pat off the soot on his shoulders. He just staggered dully at the door of the factory director's office, his face gloomy, fighting the cold winter night.</p>
<p>The partners who were wiping their faces and washing their hands all had a mocking tone: "Look at his big face, he can borrow money! Yesterday, Wang and Shang almost kowtowed to the factory director, saying one good word after another, but was scolded instead."</p>
<p>"That's right, Xiao Dong from the raw materials room didn't get permission to pre-pay a month's salary from the accounting department this morning. We workers who count one day at a time, how can we even open our mouths!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? If the factory was willing to sympathize with us poor ghosts, it wouldn't have canceled the five-cent New Year's bonus and the double pay in December long ago. This guy Zhang A'kui's memory is too bad. He forgot that he was slapped by the factory director for fighting for the New Year's bonus. He's still borrowing money from him tonight. Look at his big face! Hehe…"</p>
<p>However, Zhang A'kui didn't forget this point. He really had no choice. The factory was closed for three days during the New Year, and there was no pay for three days. The family's food and expenses couldn't stop because of the New Year. The face of that landlord and the face of that usurer Xiao Lao-san were really too scary. In previous years, there was still double pay and a New Year's bonus to offset it. If he worked more, he could still buy some sliced ​​meat, buy a dead white carp, and buy a few liters of rice. This year, he was "ashore from the boat". Tonight, he had to bite the bullet and beg the factory director. Hope was burning in Zhang A'kui's chest...</p>
<p>All the workers in the factory left with empty fists, leaving behind the lonely factory building and a piece of Yin Hui.</p>
<h3>Congratulation on Buying New Happiness!</h3>
<p>However, what flashed out from the Masha glass window of the factory director's office was a dazzling brilliance. The sound of abacus beads was crisp, the laughter was cheerful, and there were also the clear and pleasant words of the female switchboard operator. The chauffeur was going in and out of the door, one bundle after another of noble New Year's goods was being moved to the car at the factory gate. Zhang A'kui knew that the factory director was about to come out, and took off the hunting cap he had just put on again. He was hesitating whether to show his pity as much as possible, or to force his sorrow and pretend to be a flattering smile???</p>
<p>The factory director turned up his leather coat collar and came out with a cigar in his mouth. Zhang A'kui finally walked up with a melancholy smile. "Mr. Factory Director, are you going back to the mansion early tonight? Hehehe…"</p>
<p>"Don't you know it's New Year's Eve, you confused thing, you stupid bug!" The factory director paced leisurely.</p>
<p>", Yes, yes, Mr. Factory Director, please be kind and lend me ten yuan, tonight, tonight, tonight…"</p>
<p>"Money, money, where did it come from? Even the bank is closed. Talk about it after the New Year!" Then——</p>
<p>"Bang", the car door closed, and the factory director and bundles upon bundles of noble New Year's goods flew away on the sharply turning wheels. More than a dozen thin-faced employees scattered out from the factory, carrying a few rolls of monthly calendars, calendars, and other advertising printed matter. Perhaps, this was what they had gained tonight? , Saying sadly to each other, "Let's have a New Year's meeting." Then they each walked the way home. But Zhang A'kui was empty-handed on the last night of this hard year.</p>
<p>There were people setting off firecrackers on the street, and the pedestrians were also relatively lively. The bright New Year red fire tube was posted with the golden words "Congratulations on the New Year". However, the fire of hope in Zhang A'kui's heart was extinguished, a boundless darkness and emptiness.</p>

<p>Xu Qi has a major article on "Zhoubo" saying, "Ni Peng, the president of the Ni Singing Society, has passed away." I congratulate Mr. Xu on this, because if Ni Peng is truly dead, the debt that Xu owes to Ni Peng can die without proof, but Qian Daozi's Varelin has no whereabouts.</p>

<h3>Overseas Automobile Talk</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>Estimated Car Sales in the US This Year Time flies. 1936 has already begun. The giants of the American automobile industry are embracing the coming year with great hopes for both production and sales. They are very optimistic about the future. This optimism is not limited to the automobile industry; there are hopes for a return to prosperity in other industries as well. They are even using the development of the automobile industry as a yardstick for the prosperity of other industries. According to Faulkner, the general manager of Auburn Automobile Company, he estimates that the sales of new cars in the United States in 1936 will exceed three million. According to current statistics, the total number of cars currently in use in the United States is 22,000,000. Of these, 20,000,000 have been in use for more than a year, and another 4,000,000 have been in use for at least eight years. Therefore, the sales to replace older cars will also be considerable this year.</p>
<p>What Car Owners Need Most New cars for 1936 are mostly on the market. What do car owners need when buying a new car? This is also an interesting question. According to a study by Mr. Herlbut, the vice president of sales at the Hebb Motors Company, when choosing a new car, car owners pay special attention to the car's appearance and its handling. Cars that only look good but lack strong mechanical power, or handle well but have an unattractive appearance, are not welcomed by buyers. Regarding handling, Mr. Herlbut said that it is not just about the speed of the engine or the ease of climbing hills in high gear. It must also be very stable when driving, avoiding all vibrations. It must not only make the driver feel light and easy to control, but also provide passengers with various comforts. Good handling must also include shock absorption and quietness. Lowering the center of gravity can provide a sense of security for the entire car and allow the driver to feel comfortable psychologically. This is extremely important because nervousness can be very tiring during long drives.</p>
<p>Overview of Highway Construction in the United States Due to the development of the automobile industry in the United States, its highway construction is very advanced. According to a survey as of August 31st last year, the total length of highways built and rebuilt nationwide was 28,000 miles, costing $456,000,000. There are also 6,386 miles under construction, with construction costs exceeding $149,046,638. In addition, five hundred and fifty-nine English tons have been approved for construction, with construction costs of $1,509,201. The most significant paving project is 112,601 miles long, with an estimated construction cost value of US$96,297,346. The cost of slope and trench construction is $58,936,669 for 7,048 miles. The cost of using cement for road construction for 4,902 miles is $187,878,925. The cost of using asphalt for roadbeds and other expenses for 3,695 miles is $35,46,713.</p>
<p>New Invention of Flying Cars Everyone knows that cars travel on the ground. But now there is an American named Walter Waterman, who is from Los Angeles, California. He invented a car that can both drive on land and fly in the air. This car has a tail and uses specially made wings to replace the function of the tail. According to some people, if this car can really drive on the streets, then it can ascend and fly into the air when encountering traffic congestion at intersections. This would also be a novel thing.</p>
<p>Automobile Travel Promotes the Market According to estimates by the American Automobile Association, last year, 37,000,000 Americans traveled by car, with a total of 11,000,000 cars. This is a 15% increase compared to the previous year's travel season. The total amount of money spent by these tourists in various places was US$4,000,000,000, which greatly helped the prosperity of local markets. According to surveys in various places, the increase in tourists last year was not limited to one place. Almost every tourist area or city saw a considerable increase. For example, New England saw an increase of nearly 15%. Other areas such as the cities on the Northwest Pacific coast, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other tourist attractions, and the lake and mountain resorts of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota, all had many tourists traveling by car for sightseeing. The number of car tourists traveling abroad has also increased by 50%. The number of people going to Canada is quite large. The San Diego Exhibition in California and other places attract more tourists from various places than other cities. Among the money spent by tourists, it is estimated that $1,000,000,000 was used to buy things. In addition, food and drink cost $830,000,000, transportation costs for gasoline, oil, repairs, and car storage were $800,000,000, sightseeing and entertainment fees were $325,000,000, and snacks and sweets purchased along the way cost $245,000,000.</p>
<p>The Imaginary Giant Tire The Pontiac Automobile Company manufactured a total of 150,000 cars last year. The raw materials used to manufacture so many cars must be very considerable. If someone were to calculate each type of raw material, there would be a very impressive answer. Now, let's take the tires used as an example. Each car needs five tires. 150,000 cars would require 750,000 tires. To make these tires, a total of 2,737,500 pounds of cotton would be needed, totaling 1,122 bales. This is produced from 3,070 acres of fields. If the raw materials for many tires were used to make only one giant tire, then the diameter of this imaginary giant tire would be 346 miles, and its thickness would be 80 miles. With one rotation, it could travel 1,085 miles. With three rotations, it could cross the entire American continent. With 23 rotations, it would travel around the Earth once.</p>
<p>German Racer Wins Championship In the recent Grand Prix held in Italy, the first prize was won by German race car driver Hans von Stuck. He drove an Auto Union car, completing the entire 310-mile course. The average speed was 86.125 miles per hour. The time was three hours, forty minutes, and nine seconds. Italian race car driver Tazio Nuvolari came in second place. He drove an Alfa Romeo. The time was three hours, forty-one minutes, and fifteen seconds. The average speed was 85.024 miles per hour. The third place was Rosemeyer. He also drove an Auto Union. The fastest lap of the day was driven by Nuvolari. The average speed was 92.4 miles per hour in two minutes, forty-nine and four-fifths seconds. French driver Étancelin was unfortunately injured, but not seriously.</p>

<h3>A Postscript to the British Motor Show</h3>
<p>This Year's Products Sell Better Than Last Year's Orders Amount to Millions of Pounds</p>
<p>The Olympia Motor Show recently concluded last month. Various manufacturers have reported that their sales performance has increased by two to six times compared to last year. According to an estimate by an official of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, orders worth a staggering ten million pounds were received during the exhibition period.</p>
<p>The official believes that the excellent sales performance of this year is sufficient to indicate that the motor industry will increase the number of employees in large numbers.</p>
<p>During the nine-day exhibition, the number of visitors reached 232,670, which is higher than last year's 231,812.</p>
<p>In the exhibition, following last year's precedent, a special section was set up to display various accessories for motorboats, marine engines, and speedboats. The number of participating manufacturers was about forty.</p>
<p>Motorboats and Engines The ability of diesel engines to be applied to small vessels has been clearly demonstrated by various exhibits. Isaisi, who has long been famous for manufacturing land-based oil engines, has now also entered the field of marine machinery. This year, there are two diesel engines on display, one is a 47-horsepower four-cylinder engine, and the other is a 125-horsepower six-cylinder engine.</p>
<p>Coventry Victor's diesel engine is very lightweight, with a horsepower of ten. Its twin-cylinder parallel arrangement is very suitable for small boats. The 18-horsepower diesel engine of Thornycroft is even more eye-catching because all 24 lifeboats on the world's first five-wheeled Queen Mary ship use this engine.</p>
<p>Thornycroft also displayed a ship equipped with a 10 and 17 horsepower gasoline double engine, which is 38 feet long and is one of the largest exhibits in the exhibition. In addition, there are several ships made of a mixed metal. This mixed metal is named Panma Platal. It is strong, lightweight, and not susceptible to corrosion. It is said that the cost of building a hull with it is more economical than that of wood or steel. It is now heard that many ships built by the British government and other governments have adopted it.</p>
<p>Speedboats Regarding the speedboat section, both British and American products are on display. The William Osborne Company's speedboat is 24 feet long, its engine has a horsepower of 95, its speed is 18 miles per hour, and its selling price is 425 pounds. The speedboat displayed by Blandon is the latest American style. It is equipped with a 73 horsepower Chrysler engine, lined with rubber, and the propeller is propelled by a variable speed gear. This modern speedboat travels 17 miles per hour.</p>
<p>What most impressed visitors was the fact that many automobile manufacturers are also engaged in the manufacture of marine machinery, such as Morris, Austin, and Singer. Moreover, they not only manufacture engines, but also produce ship hulls, etc. (I)</p>
