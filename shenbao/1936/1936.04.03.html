<p>日蘇果卽將發動戰爭乎此値得吾人注意之問題也吾人以爲日蘇戰爭殆僅爲時間問題而依最近形勢之發展實有箭在弦上不得不發之趨向此中關鍵可分三點說明第一蘇俄對日近以遠東防務甚爲鞏固態度轉趨强　日方要求俄方撤退百伯利亞駐軍之條件似難爲俄方所完全接受第二據上月十三日東京日日新聞所載廣田之積極自主外交實含有兩義一爲充實國防允其是充實滿俄邊境之國防而其另一則爲以對俄之强硬政策爲中心使中國對日態度日漸改變此種政策之初步已見於廣田對華之所謂三原則近則更欲本此主張向前邁進第三蘇蒙軍事密的蘇俄當局既不諱言可知對於日本已無復顧忌其不辭一戰之决心允可槪見也</p>

<p>李犯態度狡黠一切諉稱不知</p>
<p>審判長乃傳訊李懷誠、李犯對行刺陰謀各點、竟一槪予以否認、諉稱不知、態度極爲狡黠、　據你昨天所供、你早年就加入同盟會、就是到民國十六年、你還在國民黨担任重要工作、並且替總理計劃過革命、已往旣然如此努力、何以此次加入反動機關、圖謀行刺、　我沒有加入、我爲革命奔走了幾十年、宗旨始終沒有變過、　你做過鐘英中學的校長、是嗎、　那是我創辦的、　你幾時知道賀坡光·張玉華·華克之·等組織晨光通訊社、　在出事前一個多月、　你怎麽知道晨光社的呢、　因爲我的朋友項仲霖住在那裏、所以才知道、　你常到晨光社去嗎、　不常去、我因爲有濕氣病、到新街口醫院去醫、才順便去看看他、病好了也約過他到後湖去游玩、我到那裏去、是沒有目的的、　他們組織晨光社的目的、你知道嗎、　我不知道、　你什麽時候才知道晨光社是暗殺的掩護機關、　出了事情以後、才知道、　你知道晨光社是何人主持的、　我祇知道出面的是賀少茹、他是社長、我還不知道他叫賀坡光、　你認識華克之（就是胡云卿）嗎、　不知道、　是那個帶你到晨光社去的呢、　項仲霖、他住在那裏很久、我遇見他以後、才帶我去的、但是不是他帶去的、現在也模糊了、　項仲霖同你是好朋友嗎、　要好得很、　項仲霖知道晨光社是行刺機關沒有、告訴你嗎、　他知道不知道、我不曉得、但他沒有告訴過我、我只曉得這個機關是立過案的、並且有政府監督、　你問過項仲霖到南京來幹什麽的沒有、　他說是替馬人麒、（註音）謀烟酒牌照稅的、　你認識張玉華嗎、　我不知道、我只曉得他叫張四明、</p>
<p>否認家是通訊處</p>
<p>但是事實並不是如此、項仲霖在憲兵司令部供過、說暗殺機關是在你家裏做通訊處的、項仲霖旣然是你的好朋友、當然不會扳牽你的、　那我不知道、他這樣供、就是在陷害我了、那簡直是一個大笑話了、　十月二十八日開談話會、商議行刺、你在不在場、我在是在場、那天我不是有事去的、我本來是約項仲霖到上海去、他說中央黨部出入證還沒有領到、不能同我一同去、一會兒就吃飯了、我還喝了一點高粱酒、喝得有點醉醺醺、吃完了飯、到隔壁房間、項仲霖靠在床上、我也坐在床上、同項談佛敎、我不但信仰、並且還有深切合一的精神、至於劉書容·張玉華·賀坡光·孫鳳鳴·華克之等、怎么進來、我不知道、他們談話、七亂八雜、我也沒有留心、祇聽到談影戲·佛敎·國際問題、後來談到中國時局、華克之發表一些議論、後來談到蔣委員長身上、大家都不滿意蔣委員長、我心裏大不以爲然、說他們對人對時局、都認識不淸、後來孫鳳鳴出乎常態、談些很激烈犯法的話、　孫說的什麽犯法的話呢、　他說要行刺、　你怎麽說的呢、　我說這種事情談何容易、還是少做爲是、那時我頭腦昏昏的好像是說了這些話、後來我就回去了、</p>
<p>談話時迷糊得很</p>
<p>你不是說過做這種事要有决心、否則就不要担任成功了也是英雄的嗎、　我模糊得很、審判長對此斥之、謂你現在做了被告腦筋模糊、當時也模糊、　開會時、說到汪院長嗎、　那也不是開會、絲毫沒有說到汪院長、　他們想用什麽東西行刺、你知道嗎、　不知道、　這枝手槍你見過嗎、　沒有、　向中央黨部領出入證、項仲霖對你說起過做什麽用的沒有、　他說是換新出入證、　換出入證是極平常的一件事、他爲什麽要向你談起這件事呢、　我問他回不回上海去、才談起的、　你問過他爲什麽要換沒有、　沒有、　開會時他們要行刺、你爲什麽不阻止、一定是你也同意的了、　我當日昏昏沈沈、懶得　話、　三十日你又看見孫鳳鳴、他同你說什麽沒有、　我看見他態度與平常不同、很安詳、很興奮、很客氣、他倒了一杯茶給我、我對他說、你們的觀察點錯誤的、　你說你看見他的態度與平時不同、是不是、　我說他態度安詳、</p>
<p>勸他勿刺蔣委長</p>
<p>你對他究竟怎麽說的、　我勸他、我說、他們的觀察點錯誤、我還替蔣委員長（那時我稱爲蔣先生）解釋、說他們認錯了人、認錯了時局、我說、蔣先生舉足輕重、誰害了蔣委員長、誰就要負亡國滅種的責任、誰就成爲漢奸、他對我表示很誠懇、稱我懷老、認爲我的話很對、就送我出來了、　你這次去是爲什麽的呢、　我是去看項仲霖的、去的時候、他已搬出去了、何以搬出去、我不知道、　你何以忽然問孫鳳鳴談到蔣委員長呢、　因爲二十八日晚上的事情觸動的、我並非鼓勵他、因爲靑年人常常會做這種事、所以泛論而已、</p>
<p>否認曾主張刺汪</p>
<p>你去年十一月十五日下午四時、在憲兵司令部供過說、當時他們决定刺蔣委員長、你說、刺蔣委員長、不如刺汪院長、因爲刺了汪院長、生榮耀、死也榮耀、你叫孫鳳鳴趕快去做、你說是你變更了他們的計劃的、爲什麽你今天不供、　這是造謠言、（全場爲之哄笑）這不是我的口供、是我在憲兵司令部中、同另個一個姓王的同案犯間談的話、　如果是你同另一犯人間談、憲兵司令部怎麽會記錄下來呢、　那我不知道、　你供過你是無政府主義者、是嗎、　我說我是心物合一的無政府主義者、這是我解釋佛經上心物合一之論的、　你又供過賀坡光負社裏的實務、華克之負經濟之責、刺汪的行動、是王亞樵指揮的、是嗎、　這眞是莫明其妙了、這些話是否是我講的、還是問題、至於晨光社的背景、我後來才知道、我到了上海、他們叫我避避、我說我何必要避、這時才知道晨光社的背景、　本院檢察官問過你、在你家裏設通訊處的事情、你也承認過的、　他們如何寄信來、我不知道、我也不在家、　事情發生後、賀坡光找了一個電報給張玉華、是你家裏轉的、是嗎、　不知道、　張玉華的自白書、對這件事說得很明白的、　我那裏知道、我家裏有妻兒老小、住了十多年了、何能做通信處、　你有一個兒子、叫什么、　叫中英、（註音）</p>
<p>兒子供過受津貼</p>
<p>他也到過案的、他供過說見過華克之賀坡光、沒有見過張玉華、華克之在我家裏見過四五次、刺汪院長的事情、不知道、他們平時來往信件、都是由我家裏轉的、都是他們自己來拿的、華克之常常貼我們家裏十塊二十塊錢不等、你的兒子都是這樣供、你何必賴呢、　華克之我以前也接濟過他、我不在家時、家裏向他借十塊二十塊錢、也很平常、但是這件事我也不知道、我也沒有叫他們在我家裏轉信、　那麽他們爲什么要由你家裏轉呢、　我只知道莫雄張子餘等在我家裏轉過信、他們都是中央的人、　但是你的兒子口供說、賀坡光張玉華的信、也是在你家裏轉的、　賀坡光與我一點關係沒有、　你去過福建嗎、　去過的、是與華克之項仲霖同去的、　去幹什麽、　因爲項的妻子在福建敎書、那個學堂的校長也是我的朋友、所以去看看、　你們在人民政府做過事嗎、　沒有、我們到了福建、人民政府的旗幟才扯起來、我與人民政府的人、無一面之緣、　王亞樵你認識嗎、　認識的、他與總理也認識的、　你什麽時候到南京的、　去年八九月　張玉華供過、晨光社的錢是王亞樵供給的、王是向陳銘樞李濟深領的、你知道嗎、　我不知道、我在上海的時候、郭衛忠叫我躱避躱避、我才知道內容、　你與晨光社沒有關係、爲什么要躱避呢、　因爲那天吃晚飯的關係、但是我有恃無恐、並沒有躱避、　吃一頓晚飯、也不要緊、爲什么要躱避、　因爲他們講過激烈的話、</p>
<p>對本案全不負責</p>
<p>照你這樣說來沒有關係、還是你自己說說看、你到底負什麽責任、　我一點責任都不負、至此、審判長以李犯雖極狡黠、但事實俱在、不容規避、遂傳訊項仲霖、但爲李犯担任辯護之律師陳耀東起立發言謂、被告李懷誠家中是否設通訊機關一點、甚關重要、此事見張玉華之自白書中、但張對自白書予以否認、請庭上對此點最好即問張玉華、審判長乃詢問張玉華、但張犯對通訊處一節、予以否認、僅謂有時從那裏轉信、審判長問通信之內容、張犯謂係普通函件、</p>
<p>項犯做曾綁匪住滬狡窟三遷</p>
<p>三時十五分、傳審項仲霖、　你何時到晨光社的、　去年、　何事、　張玉華要我謀津貼、我以社裏都是文人、就住在裏面、　你籌到津貼沒有、　沒有、　晨光社的性質、你知道嗎、　我看到賀坡光劉書容白天訪新聞、晚上發稿子、是一個新聞機關、　但是晨光社是暗殺掩護機關、大家都知道了、　我也是看見報才知道的、　他們叫你去的時候、沒有說明嗎、　沒有、　你住在晨光社多少時候、　幾個月、其中曾到鎭江幾次、　你住了幾個月、還不知他們的秘密嗎、　不知道、　你什麽時候認識賀坡光的、　在福州旅館認識的、　你什麽時候認識張玉華的呢、　以前就認識的了、　你眞不知道晨光社是暗殺機關嗎、　不知道、　中央黨部的出入證是你領到的嗎、　不是我領的、是賀坡光叫我去講一聲、我也不知道是給孫鳳鳴的、　你不知道領出入證是做什麽用的嗎、　不知道、　你在憲兵司令部供過說、孫鳳鳴到社裏、要我領出入證、我就知道要行刺、是不是、　我沒有這個供、　你以前供過說、秘密通信機關、設在李懷誠家裏、是不是、　普通信是在他家轉的、我沒有說是秘密機關、　你在晨光社和過多少錢、　幾十塊、這是朋友往來、　出入證怎樣領出的呢、　我介紹賀坡光見徐忍茹、何人領出、我不知道、　你旣有朋友、何必要叫賀坡光去、　因爲部分不同、　（未完）</p>

<p>請求通融　長江各報關業、滬上有數十家之多、為六公司量尺問題、曾引起極大之反對、蓋一旦按尺計數收費、報關行將不能維持、特為此事召集全體會議、由報關業公會議决、經各執委函致六公司、要求將量尺貨勿為過甚之逼迫、稍予寬放、如三十尺箱原做十二尺者、可改為二十尺、以示客方讓步、各輪公司討論多决、未能接受、</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪况之二十）</p>
<p>三，本埠之呢絨製造業</p>
<p>如前所述，我國所銷之呢絨，迄今仍以舶來品為主，故本埠從事製造者實不甚夥，而且規模狹小，今僅將章華中國維一兩家較大者介紹於後。此外如華東，天翔，鴻發三家，乃專製駝絨者，以其規模較大，且與本文有關，亦一併附記於後，以供熱心國貨運動者之參考：</p>
<p>一·章華毛絨紡織公司——該廠成立於民十八　年十月。資本八十萬元。設總廠於上海浦　東周家渡，並在天津設立分廠一處。係前　招商局總經理劉鴻生氏所集資創辦。現由　劉氏担任董事長兼總經理。現有織絨機七　十部，紡毛網絲車二千二百椗，一部分係受盤前日暉港第一毛織廠之舊機，一部向比國訂購。現有工人六七百名，原料大都採自國內，出品以薄嗶嘰，軍裝絨，花絨等居多，銷售本埠及全國各地。每年營業額達二百餘萬元云。</p>
<p>二·中國維一毛絨紡織廠——該廠成立於民國八年，初由李安綏君獨資開辦，民十三年招添外股，改組為有限公司。至十七年又經改組，規定資本六萬兩，組織改為無限。由股東徐麟甫之子菊堂任經理。廠址設於小沙渡路一七零號，廠內大小機器十六台，職工共一百六十人。二十三年又受盤拉都路大南駝絨廠，擴充範圍。其出品分毛織品，毛絨綫，駝絨三種。在蘇杭二處　設立分事務所，平京經理若干處，以便推銷。</p>
<p>三·華東毛織駝絨廠——該廠係合夥組織，成立於民二十年一月，資本五萬元。股東陳有運張仲良等，由陳君兼任經理。設廠址於阿拉白司脫路一五六號，置有織造機八部，拉絨機一部，男女工人的一百人，職員十五六人。專行織造各種駝絨。</p>
<p>四·天翔駝絨織造廠——該廠成立於民國十七年，資本為五萬元，至二十年增至十萬元。係股份有限公司，由沈德華，戎聽泉等任董事，沈竹銘，林瑞庭等任監察人，范廉欽君任經理。製造部設於徐家滙路三四三號，營業部設於廣東路靖遠街四八號。置有駝絨機十二架，男女工人一百八十餘名，每年可出駝絨三十餘高碼。其原料羊毛綫，因國內尙無適用者，故大多購自外洋，由本埠各洋行代訂。銷路以本埠及長江流域為主要區域。</p>
<p>五·鴻發呢絨織造廠——該廠設於勞勃生路一七四一號半，資本十萬元。初係李昌祚，烏品瑞等所合夥經營。二十三年六月改組，由烏品瑞獨資經營，後又有李耘蓀君加入合作，故其組織現仍為合夥。現由李君兼任經理。廠內置有機器十部，鋼絲車一套，雇用工人一百名左右。每日可出駝絨一千碼左右，聞其原料係採用廢毛，自製毛綫云。</p>
<p>近聞日商吉田洋行，擬在滬創設一呢絨織造廠，專織决等呢絨，行銷我國各處。聞現正在籌備中云。</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>到檳榔嶼的第二天下午，我從華文報館裏找到故友章匯，他劈頭一句話便告訴我：</p>
<p>「在大山脚當敎員的胡文波死了！」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「被現生活夾　死吧了！」他冷冷地說：「明天，你也送喪去吧！我現在辦完事，便要到寡婦家去。一切的事情讓你明天知道。」</p>
<p>我茫然地走在檳榔嶼灰色的街上。許多年來靑年朋友們的影子一個一個地在我的身邊消失了；我的心中充滿着黯傷與悚懼。</p>
<p>××死去了；胡文波也死去了！懦弱者死去了；勇敢者也死去。世界是一個，然而人的死法却是千變萬化。死，，孕育着未來；然而死了却也埋葬着過去。我們的胡文波，應是怎樣死法的呢？」</p>
<p>整個的下午我為這件事思索着。我竭力搜索着回憶里的故事。我想到胡文波怎樣在北中國的大學里舉了業，怎樣在南中國的浪濤里打滾轉；又怎樣臨陣脫逃了，把靑年的活力埋葬在南荒；而現在，胡文波是死了！是他殺死了自己，還是社會把他殺了呢？</p>
<p>讓事實顯示給我吧！</p>
<p>第二天早上八點鐘，我便走到碼頭去。一個隊伍在碼頭上騷動着。那里面有華文報館的新聞記者，有華校的敎員們，有同鄕「頭家」們，也有小生徒們。</p>
<p>一只小電船從對岸駛過來。平靜的海峽上揚起了水花。海峽在烈陽下閃起了金光，而黯傷的羣衆却在驕陽下顯着灰暗的面孔。</p>
<p>電船到岸的時候，哀樂奏起來。隊伍浸在靜默的哀傷中，岸上的樹葉在微風中搖曳。</p>
<p>一具黑色的棺木被工人抬上來。那後面，穿着孝服的年輕的寡婦俯着頭痛哭，二個六七歲的小孩牽着母親的衣裾隨着啼哭。</p>
<p>然後　　從電船里鑽出來。他揮着手，指揮着隊伍前進。</p>
<p>最前面是一幅用白布子寫着黑字的橫幅：「送胡文波先生靈魂安眠」。接着是一隊雇來的印度人的樂隊。其决是棺木。再次是死者的少婦，和二個幼小的子女。緊跟着的是一隊穿着白色制服的小孩子們，分裝在三架大汽車里面。最後是死者的鄕親，和送喪的朋友們。</p>
<p>我夾在隊伍的中間。炎熱把我的頭腦蒸昏。隊伍在靜寂中通過。祇有汽車輾着街道的聲音，和寡婦孤兒的哭泣，偶然從微風中傳到。印度人的樂隊在無精打采地奏着缺乏節奏的哀樂，樓榔嶼灰色的綠林不時在我們的眼角飛過。</p>
<p>緊跟在死者和寡婦的馬車後面，我們馬車的馬蹄子也在街道上得得地響起來，比印度人的音樂更來得合於抒發人類悲哀情感的韻律。</p>
<p>韋疆坐在我的左邊。他最初默默地不說話，待話機一開，話語便滔滔地掩藏在冷靜的面孔下滑溜了：</p>
<p>「胡文波，一個懦弱的　蟲！一個無用的智識份子子。他的眼前閃上了火花，他便跳起來；他的眼前一黑暗，他便退縮了。有着智識與熱情，然而缺乏着意志。你看他東一跳，西一跳，抱着所謂『良心』四處跑，然而結局是智識份子的良心跟着自己的身體和熱情一同喪亡！</p>
<p>「從祖國退出來，他拖着老婆，最後叉拖着孩子，當敎員，當記者，當礦山和樹膠園的繙繹，也當公司里的書記。受着生活的壓迫，他拋棄了敎負和記者的生涯而去當大「頭家」們的譯手或書記，但當他的「良心」擋不住眼前的看不過去的專實，他又回過來當小學敎員。他奔波過英，荷兩屬，他到處為自己或為他人而碰壁，最後他的精强的身體受了麝折，他的靈魂也受了傷。」</p>
<p>韋疆停了一下，加上一句：</p>
<p>「啊，好一個潔凈的靈魂！」</p>
<p>接着說：</p>
<p>「朋友們看不過眼，時常激　他：</p>
<p>「『啊，文波，抬起頭來吧！把眼睛朝着太陽！」</p>
<p>「但是沒有用。他的頭反而更低垂下去了，他的眼睛陰沈而低抑。他說：</p>
<p>「『我感覺我是老了！我巳經不中用了！」</p>
<p>「『我說：</p>
<p>「『胡文波已經死了！現在是不可救藥的了！」</p>
<p>「你想他怎麼說？他却承認</p>
<p>「「是的。我是死了！我想我現在巳經變成一隻灰色動物；並且這隻灰色動物是快要滅亡了！』</p>
<p>「果然，從此之後，他日日苛責自己，詛咒自己，希望自己的趕快完結。他頹喪，他用各種方法毀滅自己。他的目的今天是達到了。」</p>
<p>疆的話語漸漸激昂起來，但是他抑制了自己，他冷靜地把這故事講下去：</p>
<p>「最後，他病了。他咯了一口一口的血。若蘋（今天的寡婦）勸他入醫院。他說：</p>
<p>『『有什麽錢麽錢給我進醫院呢？』</p>
<p>「但是，當死降臨到他的眼前的時候，他又怕死了。於是，同鄉的「頭家」們送他入醫院，他們說：</p>
<p>「『眞可憐，這位年靑的先生</p>
<p>「所以我承認他是自殺，而</p>
<p>隊伍停止的時候，華僑公墓陽光照不到死了的人。</p>
<p>一個洞穴已經被挖開，棺木放下去之後，一堆鮮花結束了這世紀的某種智識份子的命運。寡婦的哀哭叫不回靈魂的　傷，朋友們的哀悼也　不回懦弱者的生命。</p>
<p>歸途的隊伍顯出比較有生氣：活着的人慶幸自己的尙未滅亡；「頭家」們讚揚着死者；寡婦孤兒哭着前途的陰悽；小生徒們有的抹了鼻涕和眼淚，有的却活潑地立即笑躍起來。印度樂隊零落得像敗兵，而檳榔嶼的街道却依舊在炎炎的太陽下顯得冷悽悽地無生氣。而章疆却激怒地說：</p>
<p>「靈魂的自殺者在現世紀是不可恕的罪惡。我們送喪的意義只在埋葬過去，並不是在啟發未來。」</p>
<p>在隔天韋疆所編的華文報邊悼刋上，他的紀念文的副標題是：</p>
<p>「濟孤兒是迎接未來的時代；追悼死者是送去腐爛的今天！」</p>
<p>然後我才明白韋疆冷冰冰的面孔的意義，雖然他那篇文章曾激起了僑衆朋友們的一點反感。</p>
<h3 id="c203">「平凡集」自序 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>在這本小的集子中，是包含着在所謂的「小品文年」中我所寫了的一些散文。除了極少的例外，都是從一九三三年秋到一九三四年夏所寫了的。因為文藝副刋的盛行，散文小品自然耍發達，這種在中國所特有的現象中，我雖然並沒有預想過要寫這一類的東西，可是，也居然隨波逐流地寫了這一類的一些短文。</p>
<p>每月寫來寫去，究竟共寫了多少，自已也沒有計算過；稿子是保留着的，可是，出版印集的事情，自己就始終都沒有想過。雖然也有人問過我，要給我這些短文出版，可是，第一，是因為數量寥寥，其决，總覺得這些散文過多功少，所以，結果，只有一個拒絕作為回答。</p>
<p>這些東西，原來本有會被消失的運命的。可是，牠們隨我到旅途中，到「避暑地」裏，到「別莊」裹邊，而又在我的行囊裏邊隨着我回來的時候，牠們就成為了我所痛愛的嬰兒了。我把牠們珍藏起來，我才感到牠們是我的過去的生命。</p>
<p>友人勸我把牠們集攏起來，於是，就選擇了一下，棄掉了一部分，把其中的十分之七八的數量，編成了這個集子。結果，數量是出人意外地厚，自已也感到奇怪了。</p>
<p>編成了之後，就發生了命名的問題了。經過幾天的工夫，才算想好了「平凡」兩個字。因為「平凡」兩個字饅適合我的當時的心情，是最足以為這些雜文的特微，所以，名之為「平凡集」。提到「集」字，自巳總覺得像是老氣橫秋似的；但是，只用「平凡」二字，又覺得有點不大够，於是乎，也就妥協了事了。</p>
<p>數年來，心境漸趨平凡。大地生出來的孩子，是想要把自已的生命同大地的步調相一致，這並不奇怪。惡魔不是從天使中墮落下來的，而是大地的兒子，自己每年來是這樣想法。在我的長長的人生旅途中，我曾渴望着遠遠天邊，人烟盡處；可是，這種過去的心情，現在，是成為回憶裏的烟雲了。因為，我一天比一天平凡起來，我愛紅塵，我愛人世的平凡。大地的兒子，是要同大地的平凡相步調一致的。</p>
<p>在大地裏邊生活，每日都是應當工作的：上陣打仗也好，修橋舖路也好，什麽事情都好，只要有益於大地上的人衆。「平凡集一裏邊的這些雜文，或者多多少少是帶點修補作用而作的。然而，是平凡，並無奇。在這種牛凡的工作中，也得罪過人，可是也遇見些新的朋友。「砍的不如削的圓」，歡喜向你挑眼的人，總是有他的話說的。這些雜文，是一些修補工作，裏邊，自然，不能從ABC講起，由導言從長說來，而缺漏語病，更所難免，受人悮解，自是常事；但是，假定過去攻擊我的人，不是預有計算別具陰謀的話，還是讓他的攻擊成為「過去」罷。對於無惡意的攻擊，是應當忘記的。</p>
<p>然而，在另一方面，在那個寫這些雜文的一個年間，又遇見了一些新的朋友；其中，有一個，是令人不能忘的，那就是陳君君治。可是，那一位揚州的靑年，以一種極慘的病症死去了，而且，是死在異國裏頭！自從由於一决論戰而却成了朋友之後，他常勸我多寫一些雜文，日後收成集子，對於論戰文字，把同我相對立方面的文字也附加進去：這種意見，我是始終記得的。曾經有過關於電影的論爭，因為那不是屬於我的自己的園地，就連我自已的文章也都不要了，對方的文章，自然，更談不上收進去。可是，同君冶的論爭，是照君冶的意思辦理了。論爭本身，是吾有當，曾否有結論，可當別論。但是，在這裏所表明的，不是敵對，而却是一種友情。</p>
<p>這個集子裹，不是詩，是散文，然而，是處處都表露着我的情緖的。自然，那是一些平凡的情緒了。雖然裏邊含有着一些自己的感情，但是，决不是正牌的隨筆文。稱之為雜文則可，稱之為隨筆，則是有點不行。在這一年間，我倒也曾寫過「秋日風景畫」十類唯美印象式的散文，前後計四篇，和一些懷鄕的隨筆，但，總覺不是脂粉氣和造作氣，就是情緖單調而硬板，總沒有道一類雜文自然些。寫這一類的雜文時，心境總是平凡的，態度總是嚴重的！這一種平凡，也許不外是出生的平凡了。</p>
<p>心境是平凡的。集子，因之，命名為「平凡集」。我希望能使自己的心境更平凡些才好。</p>

<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>我的家在東海之濱，消受著海洋氣流的浸潤，就是到了乾燥一點的春天，也感不到風的威脅。陽春三月，雨濛濛的似乎為了催開百花，有風的話，那就該是「吹面不寒楊柳風」了</p>
<p>自從來到了這座古城，我才認識了黃風。</p>
<p>魯北這地方，沒有山，一眼可以橫掃千里，它和塞北之間沒半點屛障，宜乎風勢的來如入無人之境了。</p>
<p>圈在這古城中的人本不容易分明四季的界限，因為還在它的懷抱中的盡是些黃花一般的叢冡，旁邊是破碎的磚瓦間雜着白骨，再就是一片片曠地，地角上點綴着幾家人家。古城的圈子不讓春色透進來，樹木很稀疏，這裏的春天，總不像春天。</p>
<p>然而，你要知道春的消息也並不難，只消拿黃風當個標記就得了。一點也不含糊，黃風好似和春天結了不解的緣，它决忘不了她，它怕靑春受不了孤單。</p>
<p>去年因為鬧旱災，所以黃風也特別厲害。它有這麼大的威風，只須一想到它馬上會使人想到宇宙的不穩！它的來不一定在什麼時候，在白天，也許在夜裏。你正在酣睡，忽然有人在急劇的搖動門窗，你猝然醒過來，心突突的跳，這時外面像海上起了濤波，像無數的的靈在吼叫，到了你體會到了響的是什麽了，鼻孔也覺得有些窒塞了，對一對牙，沙沙的一陣碎響，合上眼再也睡不着了，一種恐怖擁到了心窩，彷彿自己置身在一團險惡的氣氛中，不敢去想明早的太陽。</p>
<p>早晨一睜眼，小屋成了另一個世界，自己已不是主人，桌布，窗台，書籍…全給塵土封住了。一開門，風土一下子把你噎回來。外面在下着雨。塵土的雨。窗子和門像瘋人一般可憐的打着抖擻，細的沙土找到一點空隙便拚命的向屋裏鑽。太陽不知被吹到什麼地方去了，看不見天空，看不見地面，宇宙成了土海！人和一切的東西，在它的濤波中起伏着，用力叫脚向地下扎根，如果一放鬆會擔心一隻手把你攫了去。樹枝像一萬條蚊龍就掙着要往天上飛，而脚下彷彿有什麼絆着，聽它急得那一陣怒吼！</p>
<p>仰臥在牀上閉起眼來想着故鄕春天的那一副靜景來鎮靜盪動的心。「嘩　」，一塊拳頭大的泥塊落到耳邊來了，一下子跳起來，用力推開門，叫旋流冲到深汀屋子裏去，因為我太担心她的病身子了。</p>
<p>她正在屋中苦喪着臉咳嗽，一看見我便出口抱怨：「我說不在這個地方吧」！說完了，又是一陣咳嗽，吐一口紅紅的東西。我便擁着她到訓育處逃難去了，因為那間屋子是雙層的玻璃窗子。</p>
<p>逃難的人早滿了，人人嘴上塞一條手巾，頭髮上，眉毛上，點上了杏黃。把她安放在躺椅上，用手巾蒙上臉，面面相覷着，誰也不說一句話，這凄凉的味可以拿什麼來比擬呢？</p>
<p>一回，玻璃窗外紅的像灼起了火，帶着鳴鳴的響聲，一回，全黑了，沒了房舍，沒了人影，沒了宇宙。</p>
<p>塞北的沙澳要拔根南遞，每一個生命都懷着世界末的恐怖。看看深汀的樣子，心下恨恨的想：「誰叫你留戀這沒有春天的沙漢呢」？</p>
<p>像發怒的人漸漸細了噪子，風勢小得又叫人想到宇宙的可以留戀了，窗子也發了白色。這一羣難民解去了口罩，解去了臉上的恐怖，拍一下身子推開了屋門。這時外邊的地高處像一面白鏡，低處一堆亂草一堆白沙，微風還在逗着他們旋轉。</p>
<p>各人回到自己的屋子裹去掃除三寸的塵土再權做主人，然而明天不再來這麽一回，誰又敢說定呢。</p>

<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>住在街堂中，日子過得寂寞之至，平時除了在看書上消化時間外，此外一無辦法。</p>
<p>枯居的生活，使一個人的精力逐漸趨向無聊。在貧困窘迫中，一切希望全在眼前變暗。</p>
<p>在死寂的環境裏，生命易於消沉；像一段鐵在陰濕空氣裹容易銹腐。</p>
<p>天時又是幾度變易了。然而我還只是濛着黯的心境在衖堂中毫無希望的活下去。</p>
<p>坐在窗下，聽鄰居私塾的讀書聲；街堂中傳來的小販叫賣聲，鄰近人家婆媳間相駡聲，無賴流民在衖子裏一邊走一邊拉直着嗓子哼京調。全使我引起毫無理由的不快。中午以及下午時分，弄子裏似乎顯得稍稍熱鬧，附近小學校裹的小學生在弄裏來來往往，零零亂亂的脚聲裏有三三二二小學生唱着歌，也聽得小學敎師的皮鞋有勁的敲過弄子子。</p>
<p>有一天過去，總是默默的茶飯，黯然的心情：傻傻地惘然在</p>
<p>黃昏上弄子裏靜寂下來，只餘下年老的過路人喘吼的咳嗽聲。把一天留臢下來的疲倦無聊心情，在窗前看滿天凝鍊着寒意的灰色暮雲下，喔呀喔呀的烏鴉結着黑色的陣錢，又轉　在天空裹會操了。</p>
<p>厭倦着，遺樣的日子將如何永遠過得下去；低微的嘆息飄散在風前。</p>
<p>一個人在毫無希望，毫無慰藉的境界裏，人生的偉大與眞義，也會在心上漸漸糢糊，漸漸暗淡。</p>
<p>燈底下伴着年老的祖母，只是茫茫然想着毫無一點憑靠的生活；我開始領受到一種有淚哭不得的難受况味；被人世擯窠的悲哀，像有千萬的尖針，刺在我痛楚的心上。</p>
<p>巴望夜上會有一個好的夢，然而在夢裏還偏是走在陰暗的弄堂中，抑鬱灰色的雨意天空　看書寫文，也只是一偭失敗者的慘淡的消磨而巳！</p>
<p>不知那一天我振一振精神，動身走，離開弄堂中的生活。</p>
<h3 id="c208">「巧」 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>陸機文賦，說了許多文章利病得失的經騐的話，忽又轉一筆的道：「若夫豐的之裁，俯仰之形，因宜適變，曲有微情。…譬猶舞者赴節以投袂，歌者應弦而造聲，是蓋輪偏所不得言，故亦非華說之所能精」。這也是他的經騐之談，他總覺得文藝寫作，有這樣一個可以意會不可以言傳的「巧」的境界。關於精微曲折的「巧」的境界，先秦諸子說得很多；孟子和弟子論學，兩次說到「巧」字。一處說：「智，譬則巧也；聖，譬則力也；由射於百步之外也，其至爾力也，其中非爾力也』。又一處說：「梓匠輪輿，能與人規矩，不能使人巧。」又如莊子庖丁解牛，輪扁新輪，呂氏春秋伊摯論鼎那些故事，也是說明這個道理。（天道篇：『輪偏謂桓公曰：「以臣之事觀之，新輪徐則甘而不固，疾則苦而不入；不徐不疾，得之於手而應於心，口不能言也，有數存焉於其間，臣不能　臣之子，臣之子亦不能受之於臣，是以行年七十而老斷輪。」）大抵談文說道，達到了最玄深的境界，這些話都可以相互發明，相互印記的。兪平伯先生曾經說發此意，寫過一篇文學的游離與其獨在；而浮生六記序中那段話史說得好：</p>
<p>『文章事業的圓成本有一個通例，就「求之不必得，不求可自得。」我們莫妙於學行之流水，莫妙於學春鳥秋虫，固不是有所為，却也未必就是無所為。…我們與一切外物相遇，不可著意，著意則滯；不可絕緣，絕緣則離。』</p>
<p>我現在並不想再說發前人的意見，另用一種曲折的話來解釋這個「巧」字」字。我所問的，旣然巧妙精微，不可得而言，如他們所說的；而他們自己又為什麽說了又說，嘵嘵不休呢？我看他們的目的還在「得其傳」，又怕「不可得而傳」，乃從「不可得而言的情形之下，去找「司得而言」的途徑，所以要以「妙不可言」來說「妙」了。在這裏，我以為的略有三層意思可以說。</p>
<p>第一，他們（無論談玄說理或是藝術批評的）看出一般人的根柢病痛，在於陷入文宇障中而不能出，本來見「人」之運用「文字」，結果反成為「文字」來支配「人」，所以當棒喝，如莊子說：『世之所貴道者書也；書不過語，語有貴也。語之所貴者意也，意有所隨。意之所隨者，不可以言傳也。而世因貴言傳書，世雖貴之哉，猶不足貴也，為其貴非其貴也。故視而可見者形與色也，聽而可聞者名與聲也。悲夫！世人以形色名聲為足以得彼之情；夫形色名情，實不足以得彼之情，則知者不言，言者不知，而世豈識之哉！』（郭象註中闡明此意，說：「夫言意者有也，而所言所意者無也；故求之於言意之表，而入乎無言無意之域而後至焉。』）我們以語言文字來做表情達意的工具，而莊子乃叫我們求之於言意之表，這意味非常深長；用現代的話來講，也就定Angellier所說：「詩中的文字不過如小溪中橫列着的步石，我們可以從上面走過溪去。但若你只管在上面躑躅不走，你的脚就難免於濡濕；你得急急地走過呀！』打破文字障，才可以免於文字的拘牽；知道「巧」在語言文字之中，也在語言文字之外，才可以懂得「巧」之所在。章太炎先生自言所學，「以分析名相始，以排遺名相終」，以之談文，亦可相通。</p>
<p>第二，那精微的「巧」的境遇原每「惚兮恍兮」，「恍兮惚兮」的，但道境界並不存於虛無縹渺中，而存在於我們的經騐中。我們雖不能用語言文字來　指這個境界，但我們可用別的方法引導大家走入這境界。陸機文賦說我們創作的想像活動：『浮天淵以安流，濯下泉而潛浸；於是沈辭怫悅，若遊魚銜鈎而出量淵之深，浮藻聯翩，若翰鳥纓繳而墜曾云之峻。」我們找得一個適當的形容詞副詞，安排得一套適當的詞語排列，他以為和空中弋鳥，淵中釣魚情况相同，不遲不快，不先不後，恰在其時其地找到了，此之謂「巧」。周作人先生談酒，曾說：「做酒的方法與器具似乎都很簡單，只有煮的」時候的手法極不容易；平常做酒的人家大抵聘請一個人，俗稱「酒頭工」呌他專管鑒定煮酒的時節。據說這實在並不難，只須走到缸邊屈着身聽，聽見裏邊起泡的聲音，切切察察的，好像是螃蟹吐沫的樣子，便拿來煮就得了；早一點酒還未成，遲一點就變酸了。但是怎麼是恰好時期，別人仍不能知道，只有聽熟的耳朶纔能够斷定，正如骨董家的眼睛辨別古物一樣。」這話也可借作「巧」的說明。「巧」的意義，吹普遍地存在着，能懂得其他的「巧」，也就懂得創作上的「巧」；不訴之於玄思，而訴之於各人的經騐，這是第二層。</p>
<p>第三，俗語云：「熟則生巧。」楊雄答桓譚論作賦，說：「習伏衆神，巧者不過習者之門。」名將韓琦，每射必中，而賣油翁在旁訕笑，說：「特手熱耳。」可見「巧」並非不可得，多練習就可以懂得做得了，這是切切實實度與天下人的金針。小泉八云說：「當感情到來時，有什麽發生呢？這就是一種驚奇害怕痛楚，或快樂的瞬間的刺感，這刺感，其來無蹤，其去無跡。……誰都不能將此感情，恰如所受，立即寫在紙上。這祇有靠刻苦的勞力工作，才能成功；……這個過程，和望遠鏡定焦點的過程很相似的。常遠方的對像，能够判然地看到之先，必須把鏡筒旋進一些，旋出一些，又旋進一些，旋出一些，這樣的延伸縮短，再四反復的調整。是的，作家必須像觀光客的運用望遠鏡一樣的運用語言。這是任何文學著作上最初之必要條件。』文藝上的「巧」，並非離開規矩可以求得；梓匠輪輿與人以規矩，也就與人以巧的初步。許印芳跋司空表聖與李生論詩書云：「表聖論詩味在酸鹹之外，因舉右丞蘇州以示凖的，此是詩家高格，不善學之，易落空套。唐人中王孟韋柳四家，詩格相近，其詩皆從苦吟而得。人但見其澄澹精緻，而不知其幾經陶洗而後得澄澹，幾經鎔練而後得精緻。學者若從澄澹精緻外貌求之，必至摹其腔調，襲其字句，未有不落空套者。」這話說得極好，澄澹精緻，從鎔鍊陶洗得來，從愚得聖，從拙得巧，也就「思過半矣」了。</p>
<p>莊子達生篇云『仲尼適楚出於林中，見痀瘻者承蜩，猶掇之也。伸尼曰：「子巧乎？有道耶？」曰：「我有道也，五六月累凡，工而不墜，則失者錙銖，累三而不墜，則失者十一，累五而不墜猶掇之也。吾處身也若厥株枸，吾執臂也若槁木之枝，雖天地之大，萬物之多，而唯蜩翼之知，吾不反不側，不以萬物易蜩之翼，何為而不得：」孔子顧謂弟子曰：「用志不分，乃凝於神，其　瘻丈人之謂乎？」」這故事，我用來作說巧的結尾；眞是治奧蟲並無別法，只有勤捉之一法。</p>

<h3 id="c209">母敎比賽會 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>法租界華龍路上海婦女敎育館，為促進家庭為母親者之責任心，並造成社會重視賢母風氣起見，特定於四月四日兒童節，舉行母敎比賽會，參加兒童均須由母親率領。比賽項目：分為體格，淸潔，禮貌，應對等等。</p>
<p>這工作我認為是很重要的，一然而却是也很浪費的。這話怎樣說呢？使我不得不想起過去聯華公司有張影片名謂「小天使」的，片內描寫了兩個家庭，一個家庭是「賢母風氣」非常良好的，一個相反，為母者終日賭博，以致孩子「淸潔」，「禮貌」，等等，都及不上那個「賢母敎」養下之兒童。所以婦女敎育館如果能在這批婦女羣衆中提倡一下「母敎」却也未始不是不好的事。</p>
<p>然而這是浪費的事！為什麽呢？第一，婦女是不是生了孩子並且終其身在孩子們的「體格」，「淸潔」，「禮貌」，「應對」等等的工作上。雖然這些撈什子不要說是為母親者之責任，卽使是父親豈不然乎？擴大一點講，造成一個良好的兒童，非但母親父親的責任重大，同時社會的責任是更加重大呢。你為父母者卽使是完全把精力化在敎養兒童的身上，然而社會的環境的敎化，到後來會把你的精力化為烏有的。第二：母親自身也成為問題的，除了為要造成「賢母風氣」的那批貴婦人外，我們眼見無數廣大的勞苦婦女，自身的「淸潔」，「體格」等尙成問題，那能顧及到她們的孩子的「體格」「禮貌」呢。</p>
<p>以此二端，我認為這是浪費的舉動，然而在那批「賢母風氣」的貴婦人中，却是比較地値得重視的一件「大事」哩！</p>
<h3 id="c210">生活 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>雖在冬天，鄉下的孩子也是和天光一起睡醒的，而鄉下人又不把孩子們的玩作為正經事，於是在每天呵氣凝冰的淸晨里，便有一羣孩子來拍學校的門了。這時我便披起衣服為他們把門閂抽開，讓那一羣把頭裝在皮帽子裏的孩子跑進這黝暗的敎室裏來。接着一股木頭沒有燒好的焦味，和燃燒過的糠的氣息，便也就透進我的臥室來了。因為在北方的冬天是極冷的，空了一夜的敎室比普通的房子會更凍人些，而學校裏又沒有生火爐的經費，於是他們便每人抱着一個灰色火罐，裏而埋着點碎木炭？或是糠一類的東西，抱到各人的案頭上，這樣這三間小小的敎室里便在一種不很好聞的氣味下，保持着一點點可憐的溫暖了。敎室和敎員室是通着的，房門就開在兩者之間的壁子上，看來就像是敎室的一間套間，所以當那灰白色的小火罐一個個陸續的抱進敎室里時候，我也便聞到那在冬天鄉入家所特有的氣息了。</p>
<p>這時，我便離開了佔着那小屋子的一半的十炕，坐到那窗前的一張大的方桌前面，等着那一個打更人兼校役的老頭兒來給我燒洗臉水。外面敎室里的孩子們便高聲的讀起書來。</p>
<p>洗臉水打來後，那老頭兒便在圓圓的大肚的紅泥壼里砌上一壼開水，又把燒水時燒成的柴火盛在部灰色的火罐里，棒到我這屋里來。這些都照樣的作好了以後，一會兒便需要看看鐘，拿起鈴來在自己的屋子里搖兩下，再放下鈴，拿起點名簿，敎科書，粉筆匣，跑到那小小的講台上去。</p>
<p>敎室是狹而長的，只有三個糊着索索的窗紙的窗子，嵌在前一面的墻上，屋子顯得有些潮濕，正中，安置着幾排粗糙的，未加油飾的白木桌凳，就在這黝黯而粗陋的境况里，坐着二十六七個很足以和這敎室相配合的鄉下野孩子，在這些孩子們的特點是終日流着兩管鼻涕，不時的用兩隻巴經發光的袖子在上</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>面抹兩下，更有一些是「踏拉」着兩隻踏壞了後跟的蒲鞋，在下雪的日子，勇敢的，在齊踝的雪野里跑。唯有的兩個女孩子却還纏着脚拖着條小辮子一扭一扭的走路。敎法當然是複式的，把二十六七個孩子分成零零碎碎的小組，敎書的心便也被分得零零碎碎的。正在上着課的時候，就常常會有咳咳嗆嗆的老者，含着旱烟袋進來看熱鬧，有時竟帮着敎師高聲的管敎着自己的孩子，在這樣的時候我只有來一下苦　，或者想法把這塲面圓滑過去，因為那老者都是村子里有地位的人，是不被允許着露骨的干涉他們的。</p>
<p>在冬天太陽粘地的時候，便常常是念完了最後的複習的時候，於是那沉寂的村子里便頓時熱鬧了起來，充滿了一街孩子的喊呌，我便噓一口氣，在那土炕上和疲倦一起倒下去。不久在靜寂的院子里便會聽見一種熟習的脚步聲，在充滿了黑影的小屋子里那端着飯的漢子就出現了，飯是從十七隻洋的工資里抽出五隻洋作代價包給一家農人家的，常吃的是小米煎餅或是黑麵餅，小豆腐，很稠的粥，及特為「老師」炒的一小碟炒菜。</p>
<p>吃過飯以後，那打更兼校役的老頭兒就又提着一筐子草來為我燒炕，待燒得滿屋子是烟的時侯，便咳嗆着提着那空籃子走了。望着他那一拐一拐的走去的背影，常常會使人感到有種說不出的寂寞。只有這一點點的時間是屬於我自己的，然而也常常被剝削了去，因為說不定什麽時候會有拿着長烟袋的老者跨進來談天，或是進來一個陌生的漢子，手里捏着兩張紅紙條要我給他們看「八字」字，或是揑着張黃表紙要我給他們寫張「文書」。我苦笑着吿訴他們我不會幹這營生的時候，他們却常常瞪起一雙迷惑的眼睛來，那意思大概是說：怎麽當老師的還不會幹這麽點營生？或是和我絮叨着說以前的老師都是給他們寫的</p>
<p>明知三言兩語的解釋是沒有用的，我只有仍是苦笑着送着他們走了出去。看着他們那拙笨的影子消失在黑暗中的時候，我便困惑的想到了他們的兒子，想到怎麽樣去敎他們的兒子。</p>

<p>—憶北平</p>
<p>在深夜，我跟着友人走出了前門，在窄小的巷子裏灣着，從這胡同走到那個胡同，脚底踏着高低的石子路，一條黑暗的胡同在我面前展開着</p>
<p>踏進了另一個大胡同時，眼前亮了許多，一家家的門上，有着發光的電燈，紅綠的布帶，襯着玻璃框子，上面有着許多的姓名，一塊塊的紅字，彷彿在眼前舞蹈着。</p>
<p>我跟着在八大胡同裏走，我彷彿自己在迷宮裏走圈子。從這胡同，彎到那個胡同，祗是一盞盞電燈，和一家家開着的黑漆紅字大門。</p>
<p>從這門框進去，再從這門恇裏出來，我跟着踏進頭等的窰子，再到二等的茶室，我昏昏地跟着。</p>
<p>每走進一家開放的門裏，到一間放着許多傢俱的屋子裏，一個身段胖胖，像判官一樣的龜奴，木桶似地站着，高聲喊着一個個姑娘的芳名，這和古中國傳奇小說裏一樣的名字，春，夏，秋，冬，月，圓，花，香，美，艷……</p>
<p>一個個姑娘踏進門檻來，轉了一個身回來，一個個帶來了一陣陣脂粉氣味，一個接連着一個，長長的，圓圓的，不同樣的面孔，在我面前飄過。</p>
<p>又是踏進了一家的門，到一間窄小的房裏，裏面變成破敗陋簡的傢具，一間的屋子又是那麽舊，我戚到有些異樣了。</p>
<p>在龜奴的高喊聲音裏，一個個姑娘，又一個接連一個地出來了，我嚇了一跳，惺忪地彷彿從夢裏醒過來。</p>

<p>走回去的時候，才知道這裏是三等的「下宿」。知道這裏面的姑娘，在一天裏要遭受好幾個甚至十幾個人的蹂躪，我的心是隱隱地抖了。</p>

<p>「迷途的羔羊」因為要拍一個旱災塲面，風景幽絕的華村近日一變而呈現極度旱象。非但村前的花草果木都失去鮮豔之色，，就連那條圍繞着村子的绿水河，都乾涸得盡是龜裂了。</p>
<p>這佈景已是充分的表現農村遭旱的空氣，但這樣的佈景是經過不少人工和時間金錢才能造成的。止言那條河，面寬八十幾尺，旣要河乾，必須抽水，旣要抽水，必須先打樁築壩。連打壩帶用機器抽水，這工程之浩大，便可想而知了。可是費了這多時間和金錢，將來在銀幕上所表現的呢，僅僅不過是一個四十來尺片子的鏡頭，映在銀幕上不過三秒鐘。我們計算一下，這四十尺片子的製本不能說不貴了。</p>
<p>可是因為這次的築壩抽水，工人們却捕得了十幾斤魚吃。</p>

<p>新華公司成全好事</p>
<p>記得好萊塢盛傳勞萊哈台將分手的時候，許多影迷都起來表示反對，且有很憤慨的樣子，這就是他們合作的戲給影迷們的印象太深；他們要分手，影迷不答應。</p>
<p>在中國，韓蘭根劉繼羣是早被公認為東方的勞萊哈台的，也同樣受着影迷們的熱烈擁護，可是很不幸的劉繼羣和聯華解除了合同，韓蘭根馬上就孤立起來，東方的勞萊，東方的勞萊哈台也有了分手的事情發生，眞是影迷們所將感到很不痛快的一個消息。但是不使你們失望，新華公司現在出來成全這個好事，最近的新華影片「桃源春夢」，便是任用韓蘭根劉繼羣二人為主角的一個新型滑稽片；導演楊小仲，他預備叫你們到戲院去笑出眼淚來，自始至終有大批不容你們不捧腹的笑料；同時注意到其他角色，女主角有童月娟和許曼麗等等，是過去「桃花扇」「長恨歌」各片中得到普遍讚美的大明星。</p>
<p>如今，勞萊哈台並沒有分手，我們的韓蘭根劉繼羣在新華公司合作的「桃源春夢」也已經拍完二分之一了。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui, suffering from a severe cold and rhinitis, received treatment in Shanghai but did not fully recover. Originally planning to rest for several more days, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek inviting him to Beijing. He made a last-minute decision to take the overnight train, accompanied by secretaries Feng Zhizheng and Liu Yinglin, to the capital. Wang's departure was kept secret, with few knowing about it. In Beijing, only Ma Chaojun received the news and went to the station to welcome him at 7:00 AM on the 2nd. After getting off the train, Wang went with Ma by car to Sun Yat-sen's former residence in the mausoleum area to rest. He then visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and friends in Beijing. He returned to his residence around 2:00 PM and later went out with Sun Ke to visit friends. Chiang held a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 PM to welcome Wang, inviting heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions to accompany them. They had a lively discussion on national affairs. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the station to welcome Wang on the morning of the 2nd. Wang's face appeared older than it did several years ago, and there was a brown scar on his upper left lip, and he walked with difficulty, suggesting he had not fully recovered. According to Wang, the severe cold and rhinitis he was suffering from had not yet healed, and the doctor advised him to rest for at least a week, otherwise, there was a risk of surgery. Therefore, he decided to come to Beijing, intending to stay only for a day or two and then return to Shanghai for treatment. Due to the suddenness of his trip, discussions on national affairs would be postponed to a later date. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui, accompanied by secretaries Feng Zhizheng and Liu Yinglin, arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 2nd. Ma Chaojun met him at the station. After getting off the train, they went together by car to Sun Yat-sen's residence in the mausoleum area to rest, and then visited Premier Chiang Kai-shek for discussions on all matters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Wang to Arrive in Shanghai Tonight, Will Return to Beijing Next Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Wang Chonghui on the evening of the 2nd. Wang had just returned to his residence after attending the banquet at Chiang Kai-shek's residence. The reporter first asked about Hu Hanmin's trip to Beijing. Wang said that there was no longer any question about Hu's decision to come to Beijing. The reason for his stay in Guangdong was entirely due to the suitable climate. Hu's health was not yet fully recovered, and he was extremely afraid of the cold, so he needed to delay his trip north. The issue of "sincere unity" was no longer a serious problem. Outsiders, not understanding the situation, often speculated, but this was not the case. He had conveyed Hu's opinions to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek during their meeting and had also given a brief report on the recent international situation. However, these were all general discussions without concrete decisions. Chiang was also very eager for Hu to come north. Wang believed that Germany's entry into the Rhineland area would not lead to war. If this matter had to be resolved by force, then the war would have broken out the day after German troops entered the Rhineland. European countries were all afraid of war and were doing their best to avoid it. This dispute would likely be dealt with in a perfunctory manner. However, the European situation was complex and complicated, and a powder keg could explode at any time. To say that peace could be maintained forever because people were afraid of war was not a definite conclusion. Regarding the current border disputes between Japan and Russia, Wang said that there had been one or two dozen incidents, sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed. It was difficult to predict whether this dispute could be resolved peacefully as in the past. However, if the border issue between Japan and Russia was not resolved, then disputes would never cease. A conflict between Japan and Russia using this as a fuse was a cause for concern. Regarding the appointment of judges to the International Court of Justice, Wang said that there were already two vacancies to be filled before his resignation, one due to the retirement of U.S. Secretary of State Kellogg due to old age, and the other due to the death of a German judge. These two seats had to be filled before his successor could be appointed. Therefore, the League of Nations would notify China in May, at which time Zheng Tianxi might be nominated as a candidate for the League of Nations General Assembly and the Executive Yuan to elect. Wang left the country for four years and returned two years ago. He stayed in Beijing for a short time for two days. He was very surprised and praised the rapid progress of various constructions. Wang said that not only had material construction improved compared to the past, but also cleanliness, order, and the people's knowledge of etiquette and customs were all pleasing, which was likely the effect of promoting the New Life Movement. Wang frequently nodded in approval and praised when the reporter described the progress of psychological and material construction in various parts of the country. Due to his unhealed nasal disease, Wang was scheduled to return to Shanghai by overnight train on the 3rd for treatment and would come to Beijing again in a week. He would still meet with Chiang on the afternoon of the 3rd, and Chiang had also invited him to dinner. Wang said that he would stay in Beijing for a few more days when he came to Beijing and then go to Guangdong, or perhaps go north with Hu. After arriving in Beijing, in addition to meeting with Chiang, he also met with Chairman Lin Sen and visited Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Feng Yuxiang, Tang Shengzhi, Zhu Peide, Tan Zhen, Niu Yongjian, Jiang Zuobin, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Jiaao, Wu Dingchang, Shi Ying, Yu Feipeng, Zhang Qun, and other central figures. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hu May Come North After the Weather Warms Up</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Supervisory Committee member Wang Chonghui arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 2nd, accompanied by Secretary Feng Zhizheng. After getting off the train, he went to Sun Yat-sen's former residence in the mausoleum area to rest. At 9:00 AM, he visited Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Yu Youren, Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Qun, Zhang Jiaao, Chen Shaokuan, Ye Chucang, Tang Shengzhi, Zhu Peide, Cheng Qian, and others. At noon, Sun Ke held a banquet at his private residence to welcome Wang, and also invited Ma Chaojun and others to accompany them. At 3:00 PM, Wang went to the National Government to pay his respects to Chairman Lin Sen, and after offering his regards, he visited Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, Wu Dingchang, Wang Yongbin, Shi Ying, Yu Feipeng, Chen Zhishuo, Jiang Zuobin, and others. At 7:00 PM, he went to the Military Affairs Commission to meet with Premier Chiang Kai-shek for detailed talks and stayed at Chiang's residence for dinner. It was decided that he would continue to visit the four Yuan presidents, Chiang, Dai, Yu, and Sun, as well as members of the Central Committee on the 3rd. He was scheduled to return to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 3rd to continue treating his nasal disease. If time was short, he might leave on the morning of the 4th. Wang told visitors that his decision to resign as an international judge and return to the country was to seek sincere unity throughout the country and jointly save the country from its difficulties. When he passed through Guangdong, he visited Mr. Hu and the Central Committee members in Guangdong, and they had a frank discussion on all matters, and the situation seemed good. After arriving in Shanghai, he remained there for several days because his nasal disease had not healed. Hu had ideas for saving the country and entrusted him to convey them to his comrades in the central government. The contents would be reported after fully exchanging views with the four Yuan presidents, Chiang, Yu, Dai, and Sun. Hu's health has been very good recently and has greatly improved compared to when he first returned to the country. Although the date of his arrival in Beijing has not been determined, it should be possible after the weather warms up. It is not yet known whether Mr. Xiao Focheng and Zou Haibin will come north with him. The date of arrival in Beijing for Mr. Cheng Tiangu and Liu Lu Yin also seems to be uncertain.

<h3 id="e2">The Soviet-Mongolian Agreement: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Still Awaiting a Detailed Investigation, Russian Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Zhang <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Soviet Ambassador to China, Dmitry Bogomołow, visited Foreign Minister Zhang Qun at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd for a routine visit. The talks lasted for an hour before he departed. Foreign reports have stated that Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union have signed a mutual assistance agreement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the embassy in Russia and relevant parties for inquiries. A brief report has been received, and a detailed report is expected to arrive in Beijing within days. After a clear investigation and confirmation of the facts, a statement will be made. According to those familiar with diplomatic affairs, Article 5 of the "Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and the Soviet Union," signed on May 31, 1924, by Foreign Minister Gu Weijun and Soviet representative Lev Karakhan, clearly stipulated in the section regarding sovereignty that "The Soviet Government recognizes Outer Mongolia as an integral part of the Republic of China and respect Chinese sovereignty within that territory." Since signing this agreement, the Soviet government has consistently expressed its respect for the agreement. Therefore, the foreign reports are still to be verified. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On the afternoon of the 2nd, around 3:00 PM, a fire broke out in a poor family's thatched shed along Xiaonan River Road and the riverside in Pukou. Due to the strong northwest wind, more than 2,000 homes were burned down. Fire brigades from the Jinpu Railway and other places made every effort to rescue, and the fire was finally extinguished at 4:40 PM. The number of casualties is still being investigated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The major fire in Xiaonan River, Pukou, from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, destroyed 1,213 homes and killed three people. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Security Command has begun anti-communism measures, restricting all assemblies and associations, and directing the newly formed inspection office's secret service team to pay attention to secretly investigating reactionary elements. (Special dispatch, 2nd) The Hebei-Chahar Pacification Commissioner ordered all counties in Hebei and Chahar provinces to strengthen their local militia organizations and implement rural cleansing and anti-communism, with county magistrates and security commanders of each district to maintain close contact to ensure tight defense. (Special dispatch, 2nd) Liu Jialuan, commander of the Tianjin Security Command, convened a meeting of the municipal, water, and land public security bureaus and the military police on the 2nd to discuss strictly preventing city defense problems. Also, because merchants and residents were holding imperial assemblies, martial law was implemented from the 3rd. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun said that Song Zheyuan met with Tada, Matsumuro, Nagami, and others in Tianjin. Apart from routine courtesies, no concrete discussions were held. Song had already made prudent arrangements for anti-communism during his time in Baoding. The Hebei-Chahar border defenses are solid. The Political Affairs Committee's Transportation and Construction Committees decided to set up offices in Beiping. The candidates for the committee members are being considered, but no decision has been made yet. It is also heard that the Transportation Committee will be established within the week. Song will inspect the Jinpu Railway line in the coming days and will only return to Beiping after celebrating his mother's birthday in Tianjin on the 16th. Zhang Yunrong returned to Baoding at 2:00 PM on the 2nd. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun said that the Chinese and Japanese sides exchanged views several times in Tianjin on current issues, but there were no concrete results. Zhu (Zonglian) will stay in Tianjin for a few more days before returning to Beiping. The Hebei-Chahar anti-communist deployment has been properly allocated and there are absolutely no problems. The candidates for the Hebei-Chahar Transportation and Construction Committees are being considered and will be announced soon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The number of Japanese troops to be expanded in Tianjin is still undecided. It was previously reported that Commander Tada would be replaced, but this seems to have passed. Negotiations were held in Tianjin regarding the Hebei-East Chahar incident. Negotiations will continue after Nagami returns to Tianjin from Japan. The Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a regular meeting on the 7th to discuss and handle various foreign affairs matters. Cheng Xixian of the Foreign Affairs Committee will return to Beiping from Tianjin tonight. Chen Zhongfu is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 3rd or 4th to attend the meeting. Matsumuro Takayoshi is scheduled to come to Beiping on the 3rd to organize a resident office in Beiping attached to the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters to handle foreign affairs matters on a regular basis. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Matsumuro is scheduled to visit Han Fuqu in Jinan in the coming days. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Measures for the Export of Lu Salt to Japan, Strictly Preventing Vagrants from Selling at Low Prices, Each Bag Must Pay a Security Deposit <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Lu Salt Monopoly, to prevent vagrants from selling Lu salt at low prices along the coast after it is exported to Japan, thereby disrupting salt administration, has specifically stipulated that Japanese merchants purchasing salt must pay a security deposit of four yuan per bag, deposited in a bank trusted by both parties. If private sales are discovered, the deposit will be confiscated. If salt ships need coal or water, they must notify the port ahead of time during the voyage to prepare in advance. After arriving at the port, customs will supervise the adding of coal and water, and the ship must leave within three hours. The exported Lu salt will be changed in color by dyeing it either red or green to distinguish it from table salt and prevent private sales en route. The purchase of salt by Japanese merchants will be the responsibility of Nagai, the Japanese consul general in Tianjin. They must have a permit from the monopoly before they are allowed to ship the salt. Nagai said that Japan needs 15 million tons of foreign salt annually, which was previously purchased and transported from East Africa and Qingdao. Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the price has risen to 14 Japanese yen per ton, and it is currently not easy to transport. After negotiations with Mayor Xiao, it has recently been arranged. The price of exported salt, including freight and miscellaneous taxes, is a total of twelve yuan. The Mitsubishi and German companies are contracting the business on the Japanese side. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Deterioration of Japanese-Soviet Relations <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Hirota cabinet, general world opinion has believed that the military confrontation between Japan and the Soviet Union would tend to ease, and that the disputes along the border between the puppet state of Manchukuo and Mongolia would be resolved through diplomatic channels. However, the reality has proven to be the opposite. Last month, Germany's advance into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland in Western Europe had a ripple effect, even in the far reaches of the Far East. On the 13th of last month, Japanese and Manchukuo troops again provoked on the Siberian border with the Soviet Union. On the 25th, there was a local clash between Japanese and Soviet troops at Changlingzi. At the same time, Japanese and Manchukuo troops, under the cover of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, attacked the Mongolian border defense outpost in the Bel Lake area within Mongolia. Within a week, there were as many as four clashes between Japanese civilians and Russians and Mongolians. At present, the Russian-Manchukuo border is heavily guarded. The forces of both sides are concentrated, preparing for any eventuality. The tense atmosphere is like the calm before a storm. According to yesterday's Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, the Japanese military is quite insistent on taking decisive action against Russia, and the Japanese government will also issue a final warning to Russia. Hirota also stated that "In order to implement its continental policy, Japan will not hesitate to see even the most unfortunate events occur between the Japanese-Manchukuo side on the one hand and the Soviet Russian side on the other." At the same time, the Soviet Russian side openly established a military mutual assistance agreement with Outer Mongolia, declaring that they would resist Japanese aggression against Outer Mongolia with joint forces. The development of this new situation has made the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union enter an unprecedentedly tense stage.</p>
<p>Will Japan and the Soviet Union launch a war soon? This is a question worthy of our attention. We believe that a Japanese-Soviet war is only a matter of time, and according to recent developments, there is a tendency for the arrow to be on the string and must be fired. The key to this can be explained in three points. First, Russia has recently strengthened its Far Eastern defenses, and its attitude has become stronger. It seems difficult for the Russian side to fully accept the Japanese demand that the Russian side withdraw its troops stationed in Siberia. Second, according to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun of the 13th of last month, Hirota's active and independent diplomacy actually contains two meanings: one is to strengthen national defense, including strengthening the national defense of the Manchukuo-Russian border, and the other is to use a tough policy toward Russia as the center to gradually change China's attitude toward Japan. The first step of this policy has already been seen in Hirota's so-called three principles toward China, and more recently, he wants to move forward on this proposition. Third, since the Soviet Russian authorities do not shy away from the close military ties between the Soviet Union and Mongolia, it can be seen that they no longer have any reservations about Japan. Their determination to fight, if necessary, can be generally seen.</p>
<p>From this, we can draw a clear conclusion: that the current deepening of tense relations between the two countries is not due to the unclear national boundary or the unresolved outstanding issues, but to the relative development of various contradictory forces. If Japan and the Soviet Union do come to blows, the impact could determine China's future destiny. How can we view this with an attitude of detached observation?</p>
<h3 id="e14">Germany's Proposed Counterproposal: England as a Basis for Negotiation; Security for France and Belgium During Negotiations; France Demands Immediate Cairo-Locarno Conference <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(London) After receiving Germany's reply, England immediately held a cabinet meeting for discussion, and prepared for talks with the French and Belgian general staff about plans for assisting in defense. The Associated Press learned from reliable sources that England has decided to accept Germany's proposal as a basis for discussion. It was also learned today that the British cabinet has decided to write to France and Belgium, stating that if a solution to the Rhineland issue is delayed, England will guarantee the security of France and Belgium. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to information gathered by our correspondent, the British government has notified the French government that although Germany's memorandum regarding the Locarno Treaty has been received, in the British government's view, the transitional period for negotiations with Germany has not yet ended. Therefore, according to what is contained in the annex to the draft of the Locarno Treaty, when Germany rejects this treaty, the governments of the countries concerned should hold a conference to approve the agreement that the general staff of each country can establish to ensure the security of the territories of France and Belgium. This conference does not need to be held immediately. On the contrary, as stated in Article 3 of the draft treaty, in order to implement the public mutual assistance clauses of Locarno, the general staff of the countries concerned should immediately hold talks to maintain the effectiveness of the public agreement until a new public agreement is established to replace the original Locarno public agreement. These talks must still begin, but the procedure must be agreed upon by the governments of England, France, and Belgium before they can proceed. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Germany submitted its memorandum, there was talk in England of postponing the Locarno two-way conference. It is now learned that the French government has requested England to convene the four signatory countries of Locarno in Brussels, Belgium, at the beginning of next week to continue the meeting. This request was submitted by Foreign Minister Flandin to British Ambassador Sir Clerk yesterday afternoon. At that time, the Foreign Minister also issued a statement, saying that if the signatory countries of the Locarno public agreement do not quickly agree on defense measures, Hitler's arrogance will increase, or he may take swift and unexpected action against Austria. In addition, the general public also believes that if the Locarno two-way conference is delayed, the impact it leaves behind may endanger European peace. As for Italy, France would welcome it if it could send representatives to participate, but it is feared that as long as the sanctions continue, Italy will be unwilling to send representatives.

<p>(London) According to the draft agreement of the Locarno Conference, the British government should send letters to France and Belgium to guarantee the security of those countries. The content has been agreed upon by England, France, and Belgium. Foreign Secretary Eden sent them to French Ambassador Corbin and Belgian Ambassador Marchier this afternoon. After receiving them, the ambassadors also replied to the Foreign Office in the name of their respective governments. Regarding the procedure for the general staff of the three countries to conduct talks, England originally advocated strict regulations, but after consultation, it was agreed not to mention it.

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden held a 90-minute talk with Hitler's special envoy, General Ribbentrop, this morning. The issue discussed was the position of England in the future security pact: should it be a guarantor country as proposed in the German memorandum, or a participating country as planned in the White Paper? It is reported that Eden explained to Mr. Ribbentrop regarding the point that Germany opposes the talks between the British and French general staff, clarifying England's position, stating that the measures stipulated in the talks are only valid when Germany attacks France or Belgium. Since Germany does not want to start this against France, this objection is naturally not a problem. The Foreign Secretary also told Mr. Ribbentrop that the British government will send a letter to French Ambassador Corbin this afternoon, stating that if reconciliation fails, England is willing to guarantee the security of France against unwarranted aggression. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden received German representative Ribbentrop at noon at 12 o'clock and asked him to supplement and explain the memorandum submitted by the German government. According to well-informed sources, Eden focused on two points: 1. Firmly requesting Germany to provide guarantees that it must not build defensive fortifications in the Rhineland area during the initial negotiations between the countries concerned. 2. The British government has decided that the general staff of England, France, and Belgium should immediately begin liaison in order to restore the credibility of France and Belgium. In the future, when Germany conducts general negotiations with the signatory countries of the Locarno public agreement, this credibility will be helpful. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Officials believe that the German memorandum is purely passive in nature and does not conform to the various principles contained in the collective security organization, mutual assistance agreements, and the League of Nations covenant. Even the peace mechanisms that most European countries have been trying to create since 1919 have been completely overturned. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) The memorandum submitted by Germany will be studied today by Foreign Minister Flandin and Prime Minister Sarraut together to determine the attitude of the French government and to inform England through diplomatic channels. Semi-official sources believe that this memorandum is disappointing in its passive nature. It does not provide any solutions to the issue of whether the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia (whether it conflicts with the Locarno Pact) should be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication, and the German side has ignored the various questions raised by Foreign Minister Flandin in his speech last week.

<p>(Paris) Newspapers have expressed disappointment with the memorandum submitted by the German government, believing that it is unacceptable, is passive in nature, and is threatening.

<p>(Berlin) The detailed content of the official reply issued by the German government on March 31 regarding the four-country draft proposal was announced by the authorities tonight. The main text of the reply is divided into two parts, in addition to the introduction and conclusion:</p>
<p>Part 1: Regarding the Rhineland issue and the signing of a non-aggression pact.</p>
<p>Part 2: Regarding concrete proposals for limiting armaments.</p>
<p>The main points of the entire reply are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Introduction: The German government, in order to complete genuine and effective international cooperation and to permanently maintain world peace, hereby drafts the entire text of this reply in accordance with the will of all German citizens and in accordance with the following two principles, and provides it for the reference of the governments and peoples of the countries concerned:</p>
<p>Principle 1: The freedom, independence, and equality of the German nation must absolutely maintain its integrity.</p>
<p>Principle 2: All future international conferences should be based on absolute equality, so that the honor of all participating countries is not harmed in the slightest.</p>
<p>(1) Explains the German government's views on the Rhineland issue since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles seventeen years ago, with excerpts from important speeches made by the German leader on this issue in the past three years.</p>
<p>(2) The German government is unwilling to submit disputes over its own territory to international courts. This is the duty of Germany to maintain its sovereign integrity.</p>
<p>(3) The German government believes that the difficult work currently facing European politicians can be completed in the following three stages:</p>
<p>A period of easing current tensions and preparing for future conference procedures.</p>
<p>A period of actual commencement of the conference.</p>
<p>A period of handling supplementary work on peacebuilding,</p>
<p>Such as disarmament and economic issues, etc.</p>
<p>(4) The German government hereby proposes the following peace plan based on the above three stages:</p>
<p>The international treaties to be signed in the future related to European peace should have a dignity that cannot be ignored by all countries. Therefore, at the time of signing, the governments of all countries should have an equal foothold of self-respect and respect for others.</p>
<p>The current state of anxiety should be eliminated as soon as possible. The German government intends to complete the signing of a broader "international non-aggression security pact" within four months.</p>
<p>If the governments of France and Belgium can guarantee the same spirit and action, Germany will never increase the military strength currently stationed in the Rhineland area or move German troops to areas closer to the borders of France and Belgium.</p>
<p>The German government proposes that England and Italy, as guarantor countries, form a temporary guarantee committee with another neutral country to guarantee the implementation of the above-mentioned promises.</p>
<p>The governments of Germany, France, and Belgium have the right to send representatives to participate in the above-mentioned guarantee committee. If any of the three countries, Germany, France, or Belgium, believes that its military position has changed, it also has the right to notify the committee.</p>
<p>Germany, France, and Belgium allow the military advisors of the two guarantor countries, Italy and England, to make reports based on the necessary investigations or inspections required by the above-mentioned notification.</p>
<p>If the guarantee committee has conflicting opinions, Germany, France, and Belgium are willing to accept and consider them as much as possible.</p>
<p>Germany is willing to accept all the requirements proposed by France and Belgium to restrict military activities on the Western Front, but only if these requirements are fully mutually complied with.</p>
<p>Germany, France, and Belgium agree to hold an open meeting with the two guarantor countries, England and Italy, under the leadership of the British government, immediately or as soon as possible after the French general election, to sign a security pact between Germany and France and Belgium, tentatively for a period of 25 years.</p>
<p>The German government agrees that England and Italy may sign this pact as guarantor countries.</p>
<p>Germany is extremely willing to fulfill its due obligations to sign all military mutual assistance subsidiary agreements arising from the above-mentioned security pact.</p>
<p>Germany reiterates the proposal to conclude a sky pact to supplement the shortcomings of the security pact.</p>
<p>The German government welcomes the participation of the Dutch government in the conclusion of the security pact.</p>
<p>France and Germany should do their best to eliminate all materials that may damage the friendship between the two countries in the education of young people and newspaper propaganda, so that the long-standing grievances between the two countries will be eliminated from now on.</p>
<p>The two countries agree to organize a joint committee to manage and investigate this task in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals.</p>
<p>Any pact signed by France and Germany should be approved by a general vote of the citizens of each country.</p>
<p>Germany is willing to have closer contact with its southeastern and eastern neighbors and invites them to participate in the security pact together.</p>
<p>Germany is willing to rejoin the League of Nations immediately or after the signing of the security pact.</p>
<p>Within a considerable period, Germany is willing to conduct friendly negotiations with the countries concerned to adjust colonial rights.</p>
<p>Germany suggests and hopes that the League of Nations covenant will be separated from the Treaty of Versailles as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Germany proposes the organization of an international arbitration court to monitor the implementation of the above-mentioned security pact and to review all disputes arising therefrom. The arbitration words have the power to bind all participating countries.</p>
<p>(1) The German government does not temporarily hope for the implementation of global disarmament or the implementation of a comprehensive arms reduction plan, believing that such efforts will be futile.</p>
<p>(2) All future disarmament conferences should have a clear and recognized goal in the sea, air, and land.</p>
<p>(3) The German government believes that restricting the scope of air force activities is very important and should be bound by the Geneva regulations regarding non-belligerent countries.</p>
<p>(4) The German government believes that the following matters should be decided by the disarmament conference as soon as possible:</p>
<p>Prohibit the use of poison gas bombs, asphyxiation bombs, and other ammunition containing toxic substances.</p>
<p>Towns and cities within the range of intermediate heavy artillery positions on the front lines should not be arbitrarily bombed by the air force.</p>
<p>Prohibit the bombardment of cities more than 20 kilometers away from the war zone with artillery fire.</p>
<p>Abolish heavy tanks.</p>
<p>Abolish heavy artillery.</p>
<p>(5) If all countries can comply with the obligations stipulated in the above five sections, the German government is willing to fulfill them without hesitation.</p>
<p>(6) The resolution of the disarmament issue is the prelude to the economic recovery movement, and the economic recovery movement is urgently needed for the construction of European peace. All countries should promote its early completion.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The German government's proposal of this entire proposal is a re-expression of efforts for the peace movement. It is believed that it has done its best to fulfill its duties. It is hoped that the people of other countries will no longer disappoint us, but will jointly help build world peace and economic recovery. (1st National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) At today's meeting of the Mercantile Bank, Sir Mitchell spoke of China's abandonment of the silver standard, saying that we naturally cannot be without doubts about China's change to a managed currency system. The main reasons for the doubts can be summarized as follows: 1. The budget has not yet been balanced. 2. Customs duties and other government revenues are gradually decreasing. 3. The political situation in North China is very unstable. However, the stability of the current low exchange rate has encouraged the export of Chinese goods, and the trade balance has shown a more satisfactory trend in recent months than before. Mitchell also mentioned Japan, saying that Japan's recovery and commercial expansion since abandoning the gold standard continued unabated in 1935. He believed that the rise in cotton prices affected Japan more than Lancashire because the depreciation of the Japanese currency was even greater. However, the abundant supply of agile labor and lower living standards of Japanese industrialists may offset this adverse effect. Mitchell finally mentioned world trade, saying that there can only be hope of recovery if the administrations of various countries restore their soundness, and the artificial manipulation of agriculture and commerce becomes a more rational policy of allocating the production of goods according to the productive capacity of each country. However, looking at the current attitude of the world, I am afraid that this opportunity is still far away. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Stranglehold on the Road to Sudan; British Arms Supply Cut Off</p>
<p>Asmara: Gonda City, the capital of Amhara Province, 20 miles north of Lake Tsana, is an important town for the Abyssinian army on the northern route. It is stationed with more than 10,000 elite troops led by Abyssinian General Nasibu. It has now been occupied by Italian army light tank squadrons and armored vehicle squadrons. Italian military authorities here consider this the only achievement since the war, because Gonda City strangles the Abyssinian road to British Sudan. Most of the Abyssinian army's arms supply comes from the northern route. Now that the city has been occupied by the Italian army, the northern route has been cut off. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Front Line of Tigray Province, Abyssinia: According to our special correspondent Barr, the Madatha troops led by Italian Fascist Party Secretary General Starace occupied Gonda City, the former capital of Abyssinia, yesterday morning. These troops departed from Asmara City in Italian Eritrea and traveled 800 kilometers along the camel route (built in 1906) in 12 days to reach their destination. The Abyssinian troops defending the city did not resist and immediately retreated to the area 39 kilometers south of the city, near Lake Tsana. The residents of Gonda City are still safe and sound. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The capture of Gonda City (on the northern route of Abyssinia), the former capital of Abyssinia, by the Italian army has a significant impact on the future situation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and its relationship with the European situation is also very important. After Italy's victory, it can participate more actively in European affairs. Not only that, the area near Gonda is a rich area in Abyssinia, and its occupation by the Italian army is also economically relevant. According to the fall of Gonda City, it had been expected more than ten days ago, and the Italian army entered the city without encountering any resistance. At this time, the Italian army and Lake Tsana, where the Blue Nile originates, are only dozens of kilometers apart. The water of the lake can be used to irrigate the cotton fields in British-Egyptian Sudan, which was originally the most important place for Britain. However, Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly stated that Italy has no intention of hindering the interests of other countries in Abyssinia, especially British interests. He would not break his word. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to today's "National News," the Japanese government, regarding the frequent conflicts between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, will issue a final warning to Soviet Russia. If this measure does not achieve the desired effect, Japan will take appropriate independent action. This warning will be issued as soon as Ambassador to China, Arita, assumes the position of Foreign Minister. The report also stated that after reviewing the border dispute, it has been proven that Soviet Russia intends to invade "Manchukuo." The agreement established between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia on March 13 gives the Soviet Russian government the right to speak on the "Man"-Mongolian dispute. It is believed that Soviet Russia's goal is to inflict a significant blow on Japan's progress in China and its continental policies, thereby undermining the establishment of Sino-Japanese cooperation in defending against Bolshevism. Guangtian believes that there is no possibility of peacefully resolving the border dispute because Soviet Russia has long lacked sincerity in maintaining border peace. Japan, in order to implement its continental policies, will not hesitate even if the unfortunate event occurs between the joint "Man"-Japanese side and the Soviet Russian side.</p>
<p>According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Tokyo military authorities are particularly alarmed by the current developments on the border. They firmly believe that the Kwantung Army will be able to take appropriate measures in a timely manner to deal with it. Regardless of the attitude taken by Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia, Japan is willing to demarcate the border between "Manchukuo" and Soviet Russia, as well as between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo," organize a border demarcation committee, and establish formal diplomatic relations between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia. However, the Soviet Russian government is currently adopting a policy of inciting Outer Mongolia, making it difficult for Japan's fair wishes to be achieved. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities have suggested making every effort to increase the strength of the Japanese troops stationed in "Manchuria," reorganizing border defenses with manpower and military equipment, and taking concrete measures to prevent further disputes on the border.

<p>(Moscow) Kulun reports that the conflict between the Japanese-"Manchukuo" army and the Mongolian army at the Attik Dulun border guard outpost and Dammusik Bulak lasted throughout March 31 and part of April 1, ending on the morning of April 1.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 1, the Mongolian army repelled the repeated attempts of the Japanese-"Manchukuo" army to invade and occupy Dammusik Bulak, driving them back to the border, expelling them from Outer Mongolian territory, and inflicting heavy losses on them. The Attik Dulun outpost within Mongolian territory was reoccupied by Mongolian troops. (Second TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Kulun reports that it has received a telegram from the commander of the Kwantung Army, describing the Japanese side's propaganda regarding the recent incident. According to the above report, the commander of the Kwantung Army, disregarding the fact that the Japanese army invaded Outer Mongolian territory dozens of kilometers and attempted to occupy Dammusik Bulak, falsely claimed that the incident was caused by the sudden invasion of Manchukuo territory by twelve Mongolian aircraft, which fiercely bombed the Japanese-"Manchukuo" troops. Therefore, the Japanese-"Manchukuo" troops had no choice but to counterattack the Mongolian aircraft. Kulun is extremely indignant at the commander of the Kwantung Army's shameless rumors, because he concealed the fact that the Japanese-"Manchukuo" army repeatedly attacked Dammusik Bulak (43 kilometers from the border) within Mongolian territory, attempting to occupy it, but was driven back to the other side of the border. Mongolian sources believe that the commander of the Kwantung Army intentionally misled public opinion, not only to the world, but also to Japan itself. (Second TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>Excessive propaganda by both sides startles the world　Unclear borders mean the powder keg will eventually explode</p>
<p>(London) The political situation is tense due to the frequent conflicts on the border between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, but all circles in London, both Japanese and Russian, remain calm and undisturbed. The newspapers here publish news about the Manchurian-Mongolian border disputes, but because the information is often unreliable, they do not comment on it. It is generally believed that the news transmitted by both sides is often exaggerated, mostly with the intention of startling the world. Today, a Reuters reporter interviewed a high-ranking official, who claimed that there is no clear border line between "Man" and Mongolia, because the terrain is flat and there are no landmarks to take. Therefore, it is almost impossible to demarcate the border line. The origin of the dispute is due to the fear of the Mongolian nomadic people of losing their grasslands. This is obviously incited by the propaganda of both Russia and Japan. Today's situation seems to be part of the overall strategy of both Russia and Japan. The frequent transmission of news of border disputes is largely aimed at arousing domestic public opinion, thereby opening up a way to comprehensively resolve the various outstanding issues between the two countries. It is difficult to believe that Japan or Soviet Russia intends to go to war. Both countries now have many important matters to deal with elsewhere, and they have no time to distract themselves. Therefore, if a war breaks out, they will inevitably lose everything and gain nothing. (First Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Howard, chairman of the Howard newspaper group, declared today after returning from a world tour that the unclear border between Outer Mongolia and Manchuria is most likely to cause the next world war. The location where the troops of both sides are currently fighting is actually the world's powder keg. It is reported that Howard's recent travels have taken him to the Far East, the Near East, and Europe, where he visited many international dignitaries and had a three-hour meeting with Stalin, Secretary General of the Soviet Russian Communist Party. Howard also said that the situation in Outer Mongolia seems slightly calmer than in Europe, but although the situation in Europe is very dangerous, a war may not break out within two years, because various countries are still brewing a new situation. British public opinion can be divided into two factions: one faction hopes that Britain will participate in a security organization to deter Germany, and the other faction advocates that Britain restore its former role as a peacemaker in order to maintain international balance and devote all its efforts to resisting the country with soaring arrogance. I feel that there are two hopes for a comprehensive solution in Europe now: Countries acknowledge that the Treaty of Versailles should be repealed; Accept discussions on restoring some of Germany's former colonies. Although this is not easy to achieve, Germany is prepared to accept it. Therefore, if Germany's desires are not too great, it will be a major factor in stabilizing the European situation and preventing war. (First National dispatch)</p>

<p>Trenton, New Jersey, USA: Warden Kimble of the State Prison yesterday ordered a stay of execution for Hauptmann. Today, he announced that the execution date has been changed to 8:00 PM on Friday. He further stated that if the court is still hearing the Wendel case at that time, he may issue another stay of execution. It is reported that the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Hauptmann offender must be executed within one week starting from March 30. Therefore, Kimble may not be able to freely postpone the execution beyond Saturday. However, some observers say that the Hauptmann offender's fate is particularly good, and it may even be possible to extend his life until after the summer. The Mercer County Court will reconvene at 9:00 AM tomorrow to hear the Wendel case. Wendel is a dismissed military officer who is said to have initially admitted to participating in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, but later denied it. Therefore, if the jurors of the local court decide not to prosecute, then the Hauptmann offender will have no hope of survival.

<p>The Hong Kong Government is Investigating and Trying Four Suspects; Denying Rumors of Refusal to Extradite</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The attempt to assassinate Wang Jingwei has been tried in two court sessions. Because it is necessary to consult files and investigate evidence, the presiding judge, Lu Wenlan, ordered a postponement of the retrial. It is now scheduled to resume the trial at the original location at 1:00 PM on the 22nd. As for the four suspects arrested in Hong Kong, Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and Zhang Zhihan, our government has requested extradition for legal action. The Hong Kong government believes that they are political prisoners and has not agreed to extradite them. However, according to the confessions of Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang in the Capital Police Department, Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui organized the Axe Gang in Shanghai in the past, specializing in colluding with hooligans and bandits to engage in kidnapping and assassination. Hua Kezhi, Zhang Zhihan, Zhou Shiping, and Hu Dahai are all party members. They successively established assassination headquarters in Shanghai and Hong Kong and plotted to assassinate Song Ziwen and members of the League of Nations investigation team. Based on this, it can be seen that these offenders not only have a major relationship with this case but are also murderers who specialize in engaging in murder. Our government has decided to request extradition in accordance with the ordinary criminal law of murder and is currently negotiating. As for the judges assigned to handle this case, because the trial was postponed and the original court's official duties were complicated, the two judges, Long Canya and Wu Shiheng, have returned to Jiangsu.

The defendants' defense lawyers Yu Zhongluo, Chen Liren, Liu Zhe, Chen Yaodong, Liu Liumin, Lin Dawen, Tao Rong, Bao YunGong, etc., also attended on time. The presiding judge then announced the opening of the court and continued the hearing of the case. First, the three defendants, Zhang Yuhua, He PoguAng, and Liu Shurong, were brought to court and instructed to first read the court records of the 30th. If there were any errors, they could be corrected. The clerk then read out the confessions of the defendants on the 30th one by one. Zhang made several corrections: As for yesterday’s testimony, the targets of the assassination were Chairman Jiang and President Wang. If neither could be achieved, they would fire a few random shots, but he did not say anything about disturbing public order. He PoguAng and Sun Fengming did not go to the Central Party Headquarters, this was not the case. He only obtained the entry and exit permit and gave it to Sun Fengming. The presiding judge said that it was not necessary to send it to the Central Party Headquarters, but rather just sending it to the gate or halfway there would be enough. The reason for the assassination was not dissatisfaction with Chairman Jiang and President Wang, but rather dissatisfaction with the general social situation and the increasingly chaotic state of affairs. He insisted that the record book of the Capital District Court had red lines, and was only quieted when the presiding judge showed him the record book with his signature. When writing the confession at the Gendarmerie Headquarters, the representative of the Central Committee said to me that if this was due to ideological errors, it could be explained, and there would be an opportunity for reflection, so I wrote it that way. I did not send Sun Fengming into the Central Party Headquarters, etc. Liu also made slight corrections. After each was recorded, they all signed the record book. The time was 2:08 PM.</p>
<p>Li's Cunning Attitude, Claiming Ignorance of Everything</p>
<p>The presiding judge then summoned Li Huaicheng. Li denied all points of the assassination conspiracy, claiming ignorance. His attitude was extremely cunning. According to what you confessed yesterday, you joined the Tongmenghui early on, and even in the 16th year of the Republic of China, you still held important positions in the Kuomintang and planned the revolution for the Premier. Given your efforts in the past, why did you join the reactionary organization this time and plot assassination? I didn’t join. I have been working for the revolution for decades, and my purpose has never changed. You were the principal of Zhongying Middle School, weren’t you? That was founded by me. When did you know that He PoguAng, Zhang Yuhua, Hua Kezhi, etc., had organized the Chenguang News Agency? A little over a month before the incident. How did you know about the Chenguang Agency? Because my friend Xiang Zhonglin lived there, that's how I knew. Do you often go to the Chenguang Agency? Not often. Because I have rheumatism, I go to the Xinjiekou Hospital for treatment and then conveniently visit him. When my illness is better, I also invite him to play at Houhu. I go there with no purpose. Do you know the purpose of their organizing the Chenguang Agency? I don’t know. When did you know that the Chenguang Agency was a cover for assassination? Only after the incident did I know. Do you know who is in charge of the Chenguang Agency? I only know that the person in charge is He ShaoRu. He is the president. I didn’t even know his name was He PoguAng. Do you know Hua Kezhi (that is, Hu Yunqing)? I don’t know. Who took you to the Chenguang Agency? Xiang Zhonglin. He lived there for a long time. After I met him, he took me there, but whether he took me there, I am now unsure. Are Xiang Zhonglin and you good friends? Very good. Did Xiang Zhonglin know that the Chenguang Agency was an assassination organization? Did he tell you? I don’t know if he knew, but he didn’t tell me. I only know that this organization was registered and supervised by the government. Did you ask Xiang Zhonglin what he came to Nanjing for? He said he was trying to get a tobacco and alcohol license for Ma Renqi (transliteration). Do you know Zhang Yuhua? I don’t know. I only know his name is Zhang Siming.</p>
<p>Denies Home is Communication Hub</p>
<p>But that’s not the truth. Xiang Zhonglin confessed at the Gendarmerie Headquarters that the assassination organization used your home as a communication hub. Since Xiang Zhonglin is your good friend, he certainly wouldn’t try to implicate you. I don’t know about that. If he confessed that way, he’s just trying to frame me. That’s simply ridiculous. On October 28th, there was a discussion meeting to discuss the assassination. Were you there? I was there. I didn’t go that day because I had something to do. I originally asked Xiang Zhonglin to go to Shanghai, but he said that the entry and exit permit for the Central Party Headquarters had not yet been obtained and he couldn’t go with me. Soon, it was time for dinner. I even drank a little sorghum wine and got a little drunk. After finishing dinner, I went to the next room. Xiang Zhonglin leaned on the bed, and I also sat on the bed. I talked to Xiang about Buddhism. I not only believe in it, but I also have a deep and unified spirit. As for Liu Shurong, Zhang Yuhua, He PoguAng, Sun Fengming, Hua Kezhi, etc., I don't know how they came in. They were talking messily. I didn’t pay attention. I only heard them talking about movies, Buddhism, and international issues. Later, they talked about the Chinese situation. Hua Kezhi made some comments. Later, they talked about Chairman Jiang. Everyone was dissatisfied with Chairman Jiang, and I strongly disagreed. I said that they didn’t have a clear understanding of people or the situation. Later, Sun Fengming, out of character, said some very radical and illegal things. What illegal things did Sun say? He said he wanted to assassinate. What did you say? I said that such things are not easy to talk about. It’s better to do less. At that time, my head was dizzy. I think I said these things. Then I went back.</p>
<p>Very Confused During the Conversation</p>
<p>Didn't you say that doing this kind of thing requires determination, otherwise, don't take on the task, and success will be heroic? I was very confused. The presiding judge rebuked him, saying that now that you have become a defendant, your mind is confused. Were you also confused at that time? During the meeting, was President Wang mentioned? That wasn’t a meeting. President Wang was not mentioned at all. What did they want to use to assassinate? Do you know? I don’t know. Have you seen this gun? No. Xiang Zhonglin told you that the entry and exit permit from the Central Party Headquarters would be used for something. Did he? He said he was exchanging it for a new entry and exit permit. Exchanging the entry and exit permit is a very common thing. Why did he talk to you about it? I asked him if he was going back to Shanghai. That’s how it came up. Did you ask him why he needed to exchange it? No. When they wanted to assassinate, why didn't you stop them? You must have agreed to it too. I was dizzy and didn’t bother to speak that day. On the 30th, you saw Sun Fengming again. Did he say anything to you? I saw that his attitude was different from usual. He was very peaceful, very excited, and very polite. He poured me a cup of tea. I said to him that your point of view is wrong. You said you saw his attitude was different from usual, right? I said he was at peace.</p>
<p>Advised Him Not to Assassinate Chairman Jiang</p>
<p>What exactly did you say to him? I advised him. I said, their observation point is wrong. I also explained for Chairman Jiang (at that time, I called him Mr. Jiang), saying that they recognized the wrong person and the wrong situation. I said that Mr. Jiang is very important. Whoever harms Chairman Jiang will bear the responsibility for the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race. They will become traitors. He showed me great sincerity and called me Old Huai, believing that my words were correct, and then sent me out. Why did you go this time? I went to see Xiang Zhonglin. When I went, he had already moved out. I don't know why he moved out. Why did you suddenly ask Sun Fengming about Chairman Jiang? Because of what happened on the evening of the 28th. I was not encouraging him. Because young people often do this kind of thing, it was just a general discussion.</p>
<p>Denies Advocating the Assassination of Wang</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 15th last year, at 4:00 PM, you confessed at the Gendarmerie Headquarters that they had decided to assassinate Chairman Jiang. You said that assassinating Chairman Jiang is not as good as assassinating President Wang, because assassinating President Wang brings glory, and death is also glorious. You told Sun Fengming to hurry up and do it. You said that you changed their plan. Why don’t you confess today? This is a rumor! (The whole audience laughed) This is not my confession. These were my conversations with another defendant surnamed Wang in the Gendarmerie Headquarters. If it was a conversation between you and another defendant, how could the Gendarmerie Headquarters record it? I don’t know. You confessed that you were an anarchist, right? I said that I am an anarchist with the unity of mind and matter. This is my explanation of the unity of mind and matter in Buddhist scriptures. You also confessed that He PoguAng was responsible for the practical affairs of the agency, Hua Kezhi was responsible for the finances, and Wang Yaqiao directed the assassination of Wang, right? This is really inexplicable! Whether these words are mine or not is still a question. As for the background of the Chenguang Agency, I only found out later. When I got to Shanghai, they told me to avoid it. Only then did I know the background of the Chenguang Agency. The prosecutor of this court asked you about setting up a communication hub in your home, and you admitted it. I don’t know how they sent letters. I wasn’t at home. After the incident, He PoguAng found a telegram for Zhang Yuhua, which was forwarded from your home, right? I don’t know. Zhang Yuhua’s confession explains this very clearly. How could I know? My family has a wife, children, and elders, and we have lived there for more than ten years. How could it be a communication hub? You have a son. What’s his name? His name is Zhongying (transliteration).</p>
<p>Son Confessed to Receiving Subsidies</p>
<p>He was also involved in the case. He confessed that he had seen Hua Kezhi and He PoguAng, but not Zhang Yuhua. Hua Kezhi had seen me at home four or five times. He did not know about the assassination of President Wang. Usually, the letters were forwarded from my home, and they came to pick them up themselves. Hua Kezhi often gave our family ten or twenty yuan at a time. Your son confessed all of this. Why are you denying it? I have also helped Hua Kezhi before. When I wasn’t home, it was normal for the family to borrow ten or twenty yuan from him. But I don’t know about this matter. I didn’t ask them to forward letters at my home. Then why did they have to forward them from your home? I only know that Mo Xiong, Zhang Ziyu, etc., have forwarded letters at my home. They are all people from the Central Committee. But your son’s confession said that the letters of He PoguAng and Zhang Yuhua were also forwarded from your home. He PoguAng and I have no relationship at all. Have you been to Fujian? I have. I went with Hua Kezhi and Xiang Zhonglin. What did you do there? Because Xiang’s wife taught in Fujian, and the principal of that school is also my friend, so I went to see them. Did you work in the People's Government? No. When we arrived in Fujian, the flag of the People’s Government was just raised. I have never met anyone from the People’s Government. Do you know Wang Yaqiao? I know him. He also knew the Premier. When did you come to Nanjing? Last August or September. Zhang Yuhua confessed that the money for the Chenguang Agency was provided by Wang Yaqiao, who received it from Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen. Do you know that? I don’t know. When I was in Shanghai, Guo Weizhong told me to hide. Only then did I know the content. If you have nothing to do with the Chenguang Agency, why do you need to hide? Because of the dinner that day. But I have nothing to fear and did not hide. Eating a dinner is not a big deal. Why do you need to hide? Because they said some radical things.</p>
<p>Not Responsible for This Case at All</p>
<p>According to what you said, you have no relationship with the case. Why don’t you tell us yourself what responsibilities do you hold? I bear no responsibility at all. At this point, the presiding judge thought that although Li was extremely cunning, the facts were all there, and he could not avoid them. Then, he summoned Xiang Zhonglin. However, Chen Yaodong, the lawyer defending Li, stood up and said that whether or not a communication hub was set up in the defendant Li Huaicheng’s home was very important. This matter can be found in Zhang Yuhua’s confession, but Zhang denied the confession. He requested that the court question Zhang Yuhua on this point immediately. The presiding judge then asked Zhang Yuhua, but Zhang denied the communication hub issue, only saying that he sometimes forwarded letters from there. The presiding judge asked about the content of the letters. Zhang said that they were ordinary letters.</p>
<p>Xiang Was Once a Kidnapper, Lived in Three Cunning Lairs in Shanghai</p>
<p>At 3:15 PM, Xiang Zhonglin was summoned for questioning. When did you arrive at the Chenguang Agency? Last year. Why? Zhang Yuhua wanted me to get subsidies, so I lived there since everyone in the agency were scholars. Did you raise subsidies? No. Do you know the nature of Chenguang Agency? I saw He PoguAng and Liu Shurong visit the news during the day and issue the manuscript at night. It was a news agency. But the Chenguang Agency is an assassination cover, everyone knows it. I only knew after seeing the newspaper. Didn’t they explain it when they called you to go? No. How long did you live in Chenguang Agency? A few months, during which I went to Zhenjiang a few times. You lived for a few months, and you still don't know their secrets? I do not know. When did you meet He PoguAng? I met them at the Fuzhou Hotel. When did you meet Zhang Yuhua? I knew them before. You really didn't know that Chenguang Agency was an assassination agency? I do not know. Did you get the entry and exit permit from the Central Party Headquarters? I did not get it. He PoguAng asked me to say a word. I didn't know it was for Sun Fengming. You don't know what the entry and exit permit is used for? I do not know. You confessed at the Gendarmerie Headquarters that Sun Fengming came to the agency and asked me to get the entry and exit permit, so I knew they were going to assassinate, didn't you? I didn't make this confession. You confessed before that the secret communication agency was set up in Li Huaicheng's home, didn't you? Ordinary letters were transferred in his house. I didn't say it was a secret agency. How much money did you put in Chenguang Agency? Dozens of dollars. This is a friend to friend. How was the entry and exit permit obtained? I introduced He PoguAng to Xu Renru. I do not know who got it. You have a friend, why call He PoguAng to go? Because the department is different. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Serious Disaster in Northern Xu: More Than 800,000 Victims, Food Depleted, Urgent Relief Needed <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Xuzhou reports that in the areas of Tongshan, Pi, Pei, and Feng, since the Yellow River flood disaster, the number of victims has reached 800,000. Last winter, the provincial disaster relief association and various charities provided winter relief, but it was like a drop in the bucket, with little effect. This spring, after the ice melted, there were repeated strong winds, causing the land that had dried out and been sown by farmers to be flooded again. The victims, having lost all hope for the spring harvest, are increasingly desperate for food. Furthermore, from Fengbei in the west to Pinan in the east, along a route of hundreds of miles, the area remains a vast expanse of water. The victims have almost completely run out of food. As for the types of food, one is digging for sweet potatoes. Last year, when the Yellow River surged, the sweet potatoes that had barely formed were submerged in the water. Now that the land has dried out, the sweet potatoes have been soaked and rotted over the winter. Lacking food, the victims dig them up to eat. Another is pulling up wheat seedlings. In the land that was not flooded, wheat was sown last winter. This spring, the wheat seedlings have sprouted to a height of just over an inch. At night, the victims go to the fields and pull them up to eat, like cattle and horses. Another is peeling tree bark. Elm bark can be used as food, so the victims are out everywhere peeling it. However, they are suffering from the fact that the leaves have not grown and the bark is limited. Even this small amount is often fought over, a sight that should bring tears to one's eyes. As for where people are living, they are on high ground near the water, in villages under the trees, with grass shacks everywhere. They huddle inside, dressed in rags. There are men and women who exchange clothes to go out and search for food. Those with young children and weak daughters carry them in baskets to sell them in wealthier villages to be servants or concubines. Parents and children are separated in tragic farewells. Some even commit suicide by drowning to end their miserable lives. Those who are fortunate enough to be taken in as child brides or concubines are already living as if in heaven. Meanwhile, the wealthy households in the villages, fearing the difficulty of getting through the spring famine, are hoarding grain and not selling it, causing grain prices to rise daily. The only flour company in Xubu, which previously went to Shaanxi to purchase wheat under the guise of disaster relief, intending to sell third-grade flour at a fair price, has also recently seen its prices soar. The entire society is experiencing economic panic, and the victims are suffering even more. The cities and villages that were not affected by the disaster last year exhausted their efforts and resources in building the west dike of Micro Lake, levying labor and taxes. At present, they can only rely on foreign capital to provide spring relief.</p>
<p>The Tongshan District Commissioner's Office originally planned to organize a spring work relief program in Northern Xu to: Reconstruct the west dike of Micro Lake; Establish the Linjiaba sluice gate; Dredge the Bulao River. However, the provincial government only allocated 150,000 yuan, which is not even enough to reconstruct the dike. According to instructions, the District Commissioner's Office first sent Zhou Yushan, a resident engineer in Xu, to form a survey team. The Construction Bureau also sent Yu Shufang to Xu to provide guidance. They are immediately conscripting strong laborers from the disaster area for the work. The Provincial General Relief Association, at the invitation of the District Commissioner's Office, sent Wang Xiaobai, Chen Huichen, and Qiu Xiang as the heads of disaster relief investigation for the four counties of Tongshan, Pi, Pei, and Feng, arriving in Xu to set off. The District Commissioner's Office also appointed disaster relief investigators to assist them. However, the scope of the work relief is too small, only reconstructing the dike and not dredging the river, which is a great concern to all sectors of society. A joint meeting was held the other day, arguing that last year the provincial government, in order to ensure the Huai River diversion project, left Xu and Hai in a state of ruin. The four counties of Xu, with their meager remaining strength, fought the Yellow River for several months, ultimately bearing the brunt of the disaster to protect the Jiang and Huai regions. Therefore, if large-scale work relief is not carried out in the Xu region to clear the waterways, the suffering will never end. They specially jointly requested the District Commissioner's Office to strongly advocate for work relief, so as to achieve the goal of thoroughly dredging the river, in order to give the victims respite. It is unknown whether approval will be granted. The Chinese-American Relief Association has also allocated funds to build roads as a form of work relief. Construction has already begun, but the funds are only 4,000 yuan, which is also too little. The Xubu Red Swastika Society has recently set up a porridge factory to help the poor. It is also providing small-scale relief to the victims. Every day, people bringing children and daughters to the society's door to receive relief is a sight that one cannot bear to witness.

<h3 id="e79">Guangdong Province Plans to Levy a Special Tax on Imported Luxury Goods, Due to Significant Deficit in Foreign Trade, Aiming to Reduce the Difference by Implementing a Special Tax <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Guangzhou reports that although Guangdong Province has recently increased the special tax on agricultural products, and various factories in the interior have also been established one after another, with local goods being produced in a steady stream, due to social habits, there is still a strong tendency to purchase imported goods. Moreover, due to its proximity to the ocean, smuggled and untaxed foreign goods are easily imported. Therefore, according to monthly statistics, foreign trade is still in a state of trade deficit. According to the investigation, in the three months of October, November, and December last year, the total value of imported foreign goods in the province was 37,155,475 yuan, while the total value of exported local goods was 19,889,783 yuan. Comparing the two, the trade deficit in the last three months of last year reached 17,265,692 yuan. In January of this year (25th year of the Republic), the total value of imported foreign goods was 8,004,449 yuan, while the total value of exported local goods was 6,399,143 yuan. The trade deficit for that month was 1,605,306 yuan. Comparing this to January of last year (24th year of the Republic), when the total value of imported foreign goods was 11,491,845 yuan and the total value of exported local goods was 7,634,453 yuan, the import of foreign goods in January of this year has decreased the trade deficit by 3,487,396 yuan. Although the trade deficit seems to have decreased slightly, it has not yet escaped the trade deficit status, and the deficit remains unaddressed. Recently, members of the Political Research Association specially proposed implementing a special tax on imported luxury goods to prevent the large-scale import of foreign goods and to reduce the deficit. The original proposal roughly stated, "According to investigation, the import of foreign luxury goods in this province is very large. In the 21st year of the Republic, the import value was over 5.06 million yuan, in the 22nd year it was over 5.65 million yuan, and in the 23rd year it was over 7.02 million yuan, averaging over 5.91 million yuan per year. The rate of increase in imports is also very high. Comparing the three years, the 22nd year increased by 12% compared to the 21st year, and the 23rd year further increased to 39%. Considering that our country's economy is backward and production is declining, the consumption of luxury goods beyond the necessities of life should be gradually reduced, but it is increasing year by year, which is completely contrary to the modern principles of advocating frugal consumption and using national capital to develop production. Moreover, this province's foreign trade has a long-term trade deficit. In the past ten years, the average annual trade deficit has reached 106 million yuan, with capital flowing out continuously. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to financial exhaustion, and the national economy and people's livelihood will be in a dangerous state. Furthermore, since the implementation of currency management policies, foreign trade has become even more important. If we do not prevent the import of non-essential items, how can we reduce the adverse trend of the trade gap and stop the deficit? Based on the above, the implementation of a special tax on imported luxury goods is urgently needed. According to the investigation, apart from wireless radio equipment, phonograph equipment, automobile equipment, and photographic materials that cannot be self-made, other luxury imports, such as perfumes, cosmetics, ornaments, etc., can all be self-made. Although they may not be as exquisite as foreign products, from the perspective of customs tariff protection policy to protect infant industries, a special tax should be increased to strengthen the competitiveness of domestic goods. Furthermore, from the perspective of social policy, luxury goods are mostly used by the wealthy. Increasing the special tax is also not too harsh, as it is taking from the rich without being oppressive, and it does not violate the principle of tax fairness. During the previous European war, Germany, France, Italy, and the United States all heavily taxed imported luxury goods, and modern countries all heavily tax luxury goods, because it is beneficial to the national economy without any harm. If this province levies this special tax, it is estimated that it can increase the treasury revenue by several million yuan each year, which can be used to supplement the treasury funds during this time of financial crisis. However, there are many types of imported luxury goods. Apart from those that are already taxed (such as seafood products like abalone, sea cucumber, and shark fin, which are already subject to a seafood tax; coffee, cocoa, raisins, and fruit juice, which are already subject to a agricultural special tax; beer, brandy, and whiskey, which are already subject to a liquor tax; and silk yarn, tobacco leaves, and cigars, which are already subject to tobacco and alcohol tax or consolidated tax; and fabrics such as wool, silk satin, rayon etc. which are already subject to foreign fabric tax.) Those that are not yet taxed, specially propose to formulate tax rates according to their quality, price, and needs, and list them in the following table. Whether it is appropriate is still subject to public decision." According to the investigation, this case was proposed for discussion on the 25th. The proposed tax rate for imported luxury goods is to levy a tax of 70% to 80% of the value. The categories of luxury goods mainly belong to cosmetics, jewelry, ornaments, smoking accessories, perfumes, foreign soaps, games, children's toys, etc. (March 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Jiading: Three Arsonists Apprehended <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The homes of Liao Shigong, Shiyun, and Shiyuan on Xueqiao North, Sicheng South Street, were set on fire three times in the past year, in October of the previous year and on February 4th and 8th of this year. Fortunately, the fires were extinguished, and only one firewood shed and half of a bedroom were burned. No major disaster occurred. Now, the Public Security Bureau has apprehended Zhou Shiming, Liang Yuezhou, and Wang Fuda, all of whom are members of the Seven Star Party. According to Zhou's confession, he is the brother-in-law of Zhao Ruisheng, a tenant of the Liao family. He held a grudge after failing to borrow money from Liao, and he does not deny committing arson. The Public Security Bureau believes the case is serious and is continuing to investigate. Once all the suspects have been apprehended, they will be handed over to the county court for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Changshu: Fabric Industry to Suspend Operations <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The weaving factories, the only major side occupation in the rural areas here, mostly ship their products to Shanghai for distribution to various places. Now, they have been abolished by the consolidated tax, which has led to a standstill in the sales and shipping problem. All the products of the factories are piling up. It is estimated that there are more than 80 weaving factories, large and small, and they ship about 6,000 bolts of fabric per day. At about three yuan per bolt, the daily value of goods being held up is 18,000 yuan. This has been going on for three days. Merchants do not have such a large amount of funds to circulate. If the hold-up reaches a week, the source of income for the weaving factories will be cut off, and they will inevitably have to suspend operations entirely. The reason for this is that, according to the established practice of shipping fabric, when shipping out, it is necessary to fill out a shipping form at the Changshu Inspection Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau before loading. Now, the inspection office was suddenly ordered to be abolished at the end of the month. No clear instructions have been given on how to handle the shipping of factory fabric. Therefore, all the products of the factories are piling up. If a solution is not found urgently, once the fabric factories suspend operations, the livelihoods of the tens of thousands of workers will also be affected. The Fabric Factory Association has decided to send Wu Hongfan and Wang Guanqin by train to Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd to join the Shanghai representatives in petitioning the Consolidated Tax Bureau for a solution.</p>

<p>Tangjiawan, five li from Luzhi Town, was suddenly attacked by four bandit boats carrying thirty to forty bandits at one o'clock in the morning on one day. The bandits landed and robbed the home of Jin Hui Gao. The villagers beat gongs and gathered to resist, fighting hand-to-hand for an hour. Due to a lack of weapons, they were eventually defeated, and the bandits escaped with their loot. Jin Zi Ah Huo, 25 years old, was shot three times in the waist by the bandits and died on the spot. The injured villagers included Jin Bugao, Lu Nianchun, Tao Chuntang, Jiang Xiaogen, and Jin Aisheng, who were all shot in the waist, shoulders, and other places. The local headman, Yan Pingao, came to the city to report the incident to the local court on the afternoon of (the 2nd). The local court will send officials to the village for an on-site investigation today (the 3rd).</p>

<p>The villages of Jinwan, Shandong, Gecun, Donglei, and those near Yuntai Mountain in Lianyungang City, have been severely affected by the crop failure last year and the Yellow River floods. Many are almost empty. As the days grow longer during this spring famine, the livelihoods of the residents are becoming increasingly precarious. Selling utensils and clothing and digging for wild grass roots can be seen everywhere. According to surveys, the number of households without a single meal per day has reached more than 200. There have also been instances of people committing suicide due to starvation.</p>

<p>Since the Yellow River floods last year, the autumn harvest was swept away by the floods, and no winter wheat was planted. Since the beginning of spring, there has been a significant shortage of food for the people. Recently, unscrupulous merchants in Xinpu, for the sake of profit, have been buying up large quantities of food and shipping them to Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and other places by train and ship, totaling no less than ten thousand piculs per day. As a result, the prices of all kinds of food have been soaring. At this time of the "hungry gap" between seasons, allowing food to be exported is causing widespread panic among the poor.</p>

<h3 id="e96">The Taxpayer's Association Requests the Shanghai Municipal Council to Protect Patriotic Movements and Not Hinder the Collection of Aviation Donations from Hotels and Other Businesses <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement sent a letter yesterday to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: "Regarding the letter from the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, dated March 18th, reporting that members of the Public Concession, including the Oriental, Da Zhonghua, Jue Lu, Shenzhou, Central, New World, and New Huizhong hotels, stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council Patrol Force recently dispatched several detectives to force them to hand over all their aviation salvation fund triplicate receipt books for review. They also threatened to impose fines or revoke business licenses if they continued to collect donations, unreasonably forcing them to stop collecting without any room for argument. We request a reasoned and forceful appeal on the matter."</p>
<p>"It has been determined that the collection of aviation salvation funds is a national patriotic movement and a duty that should be fulfilled by citizens. The Municipal Council's interference is completely unfounded. Our association believes that this is not only a matter of stopping the collection of aviation salvation funds in one industry, but it is also hindering the entire aviation salvation movement and is a serious illegal event. We request that your council immediately lodge a strong protest with the Municipal Council to ensure that the same situation does not occur again, in order to benefit the patriotic movement."</p>
<p>"Also, the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Aviation Salvation Donation Committee sent a letter stating: 'Our committee convened fellow restaurateurs and organized the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Aviation Salvation Donation Committee. With the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, we voluntarily raised aviation salvation funds to assist the government and promote aviation. We have already submitted a request to the Chinese Aviation Association, which was forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval. Since the start of the collection, the results have been quite good. Unexpectedly, the Concession authorities have been obstructing us in every possible way, and recently they have intensified their efforts, sending detectives to warn various restaurants not to collect donations, otherwise they would revoke their business licenses. They also tore down municipal government announcements and forcibly collected triplicate receipts. The actions of the Concession authorities clearly show that they are deliberately obstructing our people's patriotic movement. If we do not seriously negotiate, the nation's prestige will be lost, and the position of our compatriots in the Concession will also lose its guarantee. Under this oppression, the members of our committee are filled with indignation. We hereby request your association to negotiate with all your strength as soon as possible to facilitate the progress.'"</p>
<p>"The Executive Committee of this association discussed the proposal and unanimously agreed that 'the aviation salvation donation arising from the patriotic movement has been legally permitted, and no individual or group has the right to interfere or obstruct it, regardless of whether the interference or obstruction is out of good or bad intentions. The patriotic movements of foreigners in the Public Concession have never been interfered with or obstructed. This may prove that the actions of the patrol force were not taken under orders.'"</p>
<p>"It was immediately resolved that 'the Shanghai Municipal Council should be severely restrained and guarantee that the same incidents will not occur again and that legal protection should be provided.'"</p>
<p>"Accordingly, we hereby request your council to strictly order restraint and guarantee that the same incidents will not occur again and to provide legal protection to avoid causing misunderstandings and complicating the situation."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its 26th meeting at 4:30 PM on the 1st of this month at the China National Products Bank on Tianjin Road. The committee members present were Cai Zengji, Song Ziliang, Wang Xiaolai, Bei Songsun, (Song Dai), Du Yuesheng, (Wang Dai), Chen Guangfu, (Cai Dai). The meeting was chaired by Cai Zengji.</p>
<p>After reporting on routine business, the committee considered 67 applications for small credit loans. After review, it was decided to approve one application, approve one for half the amount, and approve 48 with reduced amounts, totaling 23,600 yuan in loans. The remaining 17 applications were rejected because either the business did not comply with loan principles, or the intended use of the loan did not comply with regulations, or the applicants had declared a cessation of business.</p>
<p>The association will notify each applicant separately of the results. The association has also noted that applicants frequently fail to comply with the principle that the loan amount should not exceed half of the capital, and often falsely report their capital in the hopes of obtaining a loan. Therefore, at the 24th regular meeting, it was decided that all applications that do not comply with the regulations will be rejected without investigation. It has been observed that there are still many cases of falsely reported capital. The association is strictly enforcing the resolution and rejecting these applications for investigation. Therefore, it is hoped that factories wishing to apply for loans will pay close attention to this matter and inquire in detail when obtaining the application form from the association's office on the upper floor of the China National Products Bank on Tianjin Road, so as to avoid repeating the same mistakes and being rejected.</p>

<p>The French newspaper reported by the French Concession’s Foreign Advice Agency, said that Lieutenant Colonel Fei Chipeng, the commander of the French garrison in the French Concession, has been relieved of his post and is leaving Shanghai. It is reported that Commander Fei is scheduled to take the Nagasaki Maru to Japan tomorrow morning (April 3) to return to his country. At 8:00 AM, there will be a grand military farewell ceremony along the Bund. It is reported that those participating in the ceremony include the French naval forces stationed in the French Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council police, and a portion of foreign troops, who will also come to participate in the farewell ceremony. It is reported that Fei Chipeng will conduct several days of investigations in Japan. He will then return to his country on the French mail ship General Fei Shang on April 15 to report on the military situation in the Far East to the French government. It is also reported that Fei Chipeng will return to Shanghai again on April 17. Before Lieutenant Colonel Fei Chipeng returned to his country, the Soviet Russian Embassy in this city held a grand banquet in its office on March 31 to bid him farewell because of the close relations between France and Russia. It is reported that the banquet was hosted by the Russian Ambassador Bogomolov himself, and many important figures from the French military and political circles attended.

<p>Qiu Yujin, the owner of Nanxing Company in Nanbang Port, Sumatra, Netherlands East Indies, has been doing business in Southeast Asia for a long time, shipping native products such as pepper, gambier, and copra to Shanghai every year for substantial sales. Mr. Qiu is enthusiastic about promoting domestic products. Recently, in order to develop domestic goods, he specially returned to his motherland to investigate in Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai. After returning to China, he first went to the capital for sightseeing and contacted the Ministry of Industry. He has now come to Shanghai for business and is staying at Room 110, Cangzhou Hotel, Seymour Road. He plans to go to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai to make contacts in the coming days. When Mr. Qiu returned to China, he also had letters of introduction issued by the Chinese Consul General in Batavia, Song Faxiang, and the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that commercial acceptance bills be encouraged for circulation and, following the example of checks, be exempted from stamp tax. Now, the Ministry of Finance has approved, opening with “Your telegram has been noted.” After investigating, the Ministry of Finance said that acceptance bills are documents for payment on a fixed date. Although their usage is different from ordinary drafts, they are still a type of draft by nature, which is already included in the scope of documents for money transfer. The Ministry of Finance said that stamp duty should be paid in accordance with the law. It also said that only the item of checks has been temporarily exempted this time in Article 16 and Tax Rate Table 4 of the amended Stamp Duty Law. As drafts are not on the list, there is no way to handle this following the example of checks. The Ministry of Finance said that what was requested should not be discussed. This is the response.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Cai Zengji, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Encourages Employees to Fulfill Their Responsibilities: Currently Undergoing Reorganization, Hoping for Mutual Encouragement to Develop Domestic and Foreign Routes and Recover Profits <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Since Cai Zengji took over as General Manager of the State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been determined to reorganize the company and has spared no effort. All reorganization plans have been implemented in order. Cai issued a notice to encourage employees the other day, which is excerpted below: "Since the reorganization of this bureau, various</p>
<p>reorganization plans</p>
<p>have been promulgated by the Ministry of Transportation and implemented accordingly. However, at the beginning of the reorganization, the original intention of all facilities may not be fully understood. Therefore, I would like to sincerely express my thoughts to my employees, who share weal and woe with me. In the international competitive environment of the 20th century, any country that can survive relies entirely on active policies and active implementation. The so-called active is just like what the sages said, 'burn the boats and break the pots,' and what President Chiang said, 'hard work' and 'bitter work.' If you try to look at Italy’s recent years of enhancing its national status, and Germany’s restoring its lost authority, both are using the implementation of active policies as the only effective weapon. Our country is very weak and it is more than necessary to save it from its current dangers. This bureau is a state-run shipping agency and is responsible for river and sea transportation, which is related to the lifeline of transportation. This time, the Ministry of Transportation, in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, is determined to reorganize this bureau, which is actually a part of implementing the government's active policies to save the country from its dangers. This bureau has now followed the order to cancel all</p>
<p>contracting systems</p>
<p>for all river steamers from April 1st. In the future, the reorganization of wharves, warehouses, real estate, and other ships will continue to be implemented. All patriots, aware that the affairs of this bureau are</p>
<p>related to the safety of the country,</p>
<p>should know to obey government orders and rise up to assist in order to realize the reorganization plan. The employees of this bureau are all part of the nation, and their clothing and food are even more closely related. They have the responsibility to obey and implement the order. In the notice issued by President Chiang of the Executive Yuan on the reorganization of this bureau, it says, 'The Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Transportation to reorganize the bureau, amend the organizational regulations of the bureau, and instruct on reorganization methods. The intention is to completely eliminate and clear out the long-standing malpractices of harming the public for personal gain and procrastination and perfunctoriness. If such measures are not thoroughly reformed, it will be understood and accepted by those who understand reason. The staff of the bureau have been serving in the bureau for a long time and are familiar with the situation. Regarding how to eliminate the long-standing malpractices, how to improve the business, and how to increase income and reduce expenditure, if there are any insights, they can be fully presented to their superiors for adoption. If they do not</p>
<p>follow the proper procedures</p>
<p>and insist on their own private opinions, or even be seduced by bad elements from the outside world, sow discord, and instigate disturbances, causing the bureau's business to be affected, the president will regard it as a violation of discipline and destruction of transportation and will strictly enforce the law and will not tolerate it in the slightest. In addition, if employees in branch offices and warehouses and docks have such behavior, they should also be punished equally.’ I, all employees in office, have long understood this deeply, and can each be able to do their duty, cooperate, and jointly plan for progress, to complete their mission, so as to directly seek the interests of the majority of people, and indirectly seek the wealth and strength of the country. Those who are used by others, and seek personal gain, regardless of the interests of the country, deliberately obstruct progress, this bureau, even if it wants to be lenient, will not be allowed by the law. This bureau firmly believes that most employees are able to understand righteousness and do not need further instructions. However, if there are a few who do not understand the truth, all employees should, based on their personal responsibilities, turn to enlightening them, and work together to achieve success. If they do not follow the enlightenment, they should immediately report to the主管 personnel for investigation and handling. Furthermore, the bureau has been established for more than 60 years, and to this day the tonnage of ships is only more than 70,000 tons,</p>
<p>the scope of the routes</p>
<p>is only domestic, to the north and south oceans, and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. If you try to compare it with the Japan Mail Ship Company of Japanese merchants, which was established two years after the establishment of this bureau, the tonnage of ships has reached more than 770,000 tons, and even as far as Europe and the United States, as well as India, Australia, South America and other places, there are its routes. Compared to this bureau, one cannot avoid being too</p>
<p>harsh.</p>
<p>The reason why the Japan Mail Ship Company has developed day by day is that it relies on the people of the whole country to support and help each other, and the joint efforts of the employees, which has created an unparalleled career. The past history of this bureau will not be detailed here. Now it is not too late to mend the fold even after a sheep has been lost. From now on, we will gradually reorganize, increase the tonnage of ships, fully expand domestic routes, recover the lost profits, and in the future, extend the routes to the Nanyang Islands, where overseas Chinese reside, and to places such as Little Luzon, relying on the sincere patriotism of enthusiastic people across the country to support and help each other, so as to realize it. But how to start implementing it is the responsibility of all the employees in the bureau, which cannot be emphasized enough</p>
<p>with diligence and mutual encouragement,</p>
<p>in order to fulfill their responsibilities. I am willing to encourage this with all the employees in office, and hereby announce it. Cai Zengji, General Manager of the State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, April 1, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Special District Rickshaw Merchants Still Suspended Business Yesterday; Rickshaw Pullers Clashed with Police Due to Forcibly Seizing Vehicles; Deflated Rickshaw Pullers Have Been Sentenced Separately by the Court; Mutual Aid Society Decides to Issue Relief Funds During the Suspension Period <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw merchants in the special district, protesting the reduction of rickshaw rental fees by the Public Works Department, have collectively stopped operating their vehicles since April 1st, effectively staging a market strike. Yesterday, the merchants continued their suspension, and rickshaw pullers, pressured by their livelihoods, demanded the release of the vehicles, leading to disturbances. The rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society convened in the afternoon to discuss relief measures for the pullers. Party and government authorities dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth. Deflated rickshaw pullers were sentenced separately by the court yesterday. The details of each situation are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Continued Suspension</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM the night before last, the Special District Rickshaw Guild convened an emergency cadre meeting due to the Public Works Department Board of Directors' refusal to reduce the rickshaw rental fees. Attendees included Yin Zhiling, Hou Shao'an, Gu Songmao, and others. During the meeting, Yin Zhiling first reported on the petition process. After discussion, based on the opinions of the rickshaw pullers and merchants, it was decided to continue the struggle until a resolution was reached to achieve their demands. Therefore, it was resolved that the strike would continue on the 2nd. (New Voice Society)</p>
<p>Demand to Release Vehicles</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, rickshaw pullers from various districts held a meeting at the mutual aid society on Jiaxing Road. It was decided to petition the rickshaw merchants' mutual aid society and the Ratepayers' Association, demanding the release of vehicles for business. They first went to the residence of rickshaw owner Yin Zhiling to negotiate. Then, at 10:00 AM, they sent representatives, including Hou Debiao and five others, to petition the Rickshaw Committee. Chairman Massey received them and promised to find a solution. They then went to the Ratepayers' Association to make the same petition. More than a thousand rickshaw pullers also went to the mutual aid societies on Maigen Road and Beile Road to request relief. (New Voice Society)</p>
<p>Conflict Erupted</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, about fifty rickshaws belonging to rickshaw owners such as Xu Songxi were hidden in empty houses on Xietu Road and Father Du Road. Rickshaw pullers found out and gathered over a hundred people to demand the release of the vehicles. However, the guards refused to release the vehicles without the owners' consent. The rickshaw pullers shouted, "If we don't work for a day, we have nothing to eat. Our families will starve!" This led to a dispute, and the rickshaw pullers seized the vehicles and fled. During the chaos, the guards were beaten and injured. The relevant Chinese Concession police authorities dispatched a large number of officers to the scene to suppress the situation, preventing further accidents. The owners recorded the numbers of all seized vehicles and reported them to the Rickshaw Guild, which sent personnel to investigate on various roads. At around 9:00 AM on the same morning, over five hundred rickshaw pullers gathered near Jumen Road in the Nanshi district and flocked to the Liyuan Road No. 39 Rickshaw Company, demanding the release of vehicles. The company refused to release the vehicles, citing the industry's decision not to do so until a satisfactory solution was reached, leading to a conflict. Sha Bingming, a police officer stationed at the Jumen Road police station of the Ximen Branch, went to investigate due to the large number of people, which led to a misunderstanding and he was beaten by the rickshaw pullers. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by ambulance. Subsequently, patrol officer Zhang Shaoqin noticed the situation and went to mediate, but was also mistakenly beaten, although his injuries were not serious enough to require hospitalization. Upon receiving the news, the Ximen Branch dispatched over forty officers, led by Branch Chief Yao, to suppress the situation. The rickshaw pullers then flocked to the Southern District branch of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society. At this time, the French Concession police sent a large number of detectives to stop them, leading to another conflict. Rickshaw pullers Xu Housheng, Xu Hejin, and Wang Cilin were injured, with Xu Housheng being the most seriously injured. The French Concession police dispatched over fifty Chinese and foreign detectives and special patrol officers to patrol the area. The Chinese territory also dispatched dozens of officers to maintain strict vigilance to prevent further conflicts. (New New Society)</p>
<p>Preserving Empty Vehicles</p>
<p>Around noon yesterday, about five thousand rickshaw pullers from the northern and southern cities went to various rickshaw leasing agents and pulled empty vehicles into the concession. However, most owners had deflated the tires or stored the cushions, so the rickshaw pullers were unable to operate, even though they had pulled them into the concession. Therefore, they dragged them to various police stations for storage. By 5:00 PM, the Gordon Road Police Station had over a thousand vehicles, and the Avenue Road Police Station had over five hundred vehicles. Other police stations also had vehicles dragged in for storage. According to police officials, since the rickshaw pullers could not operate the vehicles after pulling them into the concession, they feared theft and disputes, so they instructed the rickshaw pullers to drag them to the police stations for temporary storage. The vehicles would only be returned after the owners had provided proof to the police station. (Ta Kung Society)</p>
<p>Seizing Vehicles in Zhabei</p>
<p>Between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM yesterday, at the Qin Mingde Rickshaw Company in Fuyuan Lane, Wuzhen Road, Zhabei; the Li Xichun Rickshaw Company on Wuzhen Road; the Liu Guiji Rickshaw Company in Yuchang Zu Lane, Xinjiang Road; the Wang Lianji Rickshaw Company in Huazhen Fang, Xinjiang Road; the Feixing Rickshaw Company operated by Gu Songmao at the intersection of Guoqing Road and Xinmin Road; and the Feixing Rickshaw Company in Feixing Lane, Xinmin Road, about a thousand rickshaw pullers forcibly seized and pulled rickshaws from these companies. Their reason was that they were "daily-wage coolies" who could not live without pulling a rickshaw for a day. This was learned by Cui Hu, a patrol officer from the Wuzhen Road police station of the Xinzha Branch, who immediately led officers Wu Dengxin, Hu Yao, and others to suppress the situation and maintain order. He persuaded the companies to release the vehicles, and the disturbance was quelled. The Xinzha Branch, upon hearing the news, ordered the deputy leaders of the detective squad, Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan, to lead detectives Sun Youzhi and others to assist at the scene. The Detective Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent detective Yu Liangzhi to investigate the incident and report the situation. Officer Cui of the Wuzhen Road police station, fearing further unexpected incidents, issued a strict order stating that the police station bore a major responsibility for suppressing and maintaining order during the rickshaw puller disturbance, and that no officers were allowed to leave their posts.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Petition</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, rickshaw pullers held a temporary meeting at the mutual aid society. After discussion, they decided to insist on three demands and continue to petition the Rickshaw Committee of the Upper Public Works Department and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, requesting assistance to force rickshaw merchants to reduce rental fees and release vehicles for business in order to maintain their livelihoods. They elected Tan Zhengyu, Hou Debiao, Chen Naicun, Gao Yongquan, and others as representatives to petition the Public Works Department at 10:00 AM. Chairman Massey of the Rickshaw Committee received them and expressed his acceptance of their demands, instructing them to strictly observe public order and seek assistance from all parties through peaceful means. The representatives were satisfied and left. They then petitioned the Ratepayers' Association, which also promised to provide assistance. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the rickshaw pullers held another meeting at the mutual aid society, resolving to organize a representative petition group to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Citizens' Federation at 10:00 AM today. (New New Society)</p>
<p>Party and Government Relief</p>
<p>A public document from the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society Rickshaw Pullers' Council and He Wushan stated that yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they specially met with rickshaw puller representatives Xia Huaixiang, Zhu Fengxiang, Yang Xingyou, Ji Decai, and over one hundred and twenty others, and went by car to the Municipal Party Headquarters at Fenglin Bridge to petition. The Municipal Party Headquarters dispatched Zhang Sheng, a cadre from the People's Movement Section, to receive them. After inquiring about the purpose of the petition, he promised to forward the situation to higher authorities for review. The representatives were satisfied and went to petition the Municipal Central District Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau dispatched Zhang Chuqiang to receive them, stating that the authorities had already been informed of the situation yesterday and would handle it quickly after preparing proper measures. The representatives were satisfied and returned. The Social Affairs Bureau dispatched Wang Gang, director of the Welfare Industry Section of the Third Division, to the trade association and various parties to investigate the truth. The Municipal Party Headquarters, based on the rickshaw pullers' petition, also dispatched personnel to investigate the process in order to discuss solutions. (New Voice Society)</p>
<p>Admonishing Rickshaw Merchants</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 2nd, the French Concession Police Department summoned several important public rickshaw merchants within the concession, numbered from 1 to 10,000, for a discussion. The police urged the merchants to pay close attention to the special nature of the suspension of rickshaw rentals since the 1st of this month and the livelihoods of the tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers and their families affected by the event. They were urged to resume business as soon as possible so that the unsustainable situation caused by the merchants' suspension could be stopped immediately. The merchants promised to pay each currently unemployed rickshaw puller two dimes per day to maintain their livelihoods and compensate for the losses incurred during unemployment.</p>
<p>Warning to Rickshaw Owners</p>
<p>According to a Public Works Department Intelligence Office report, a spokesman for the Public Works Department Rickshaw Affairs Committee stated that since public rickshaw owners had declared a suspension of business to resist the Public Works Department Board of Directors' proposed reduction of rickshaw rental fees, the Rickshaw Committee intended to suspend the reissuance of some of the existing licenses. The type of licenses subject to suspension would depend on whether the owner was a leader in the dispute and whether they were adamant about suspending vehicle operations. Therefore, the Rickshaw Committee had to earnestly warn all rickshaw owners to promptly claim their April licenses and immediately release their vehicles. Those who heeded the warning would have the least opportunity for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Since all rickshaw pullers of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society were members, the society was concerned about the future if this situation continued. The society convened a special meeting of the board of directors at 5:00 PM yesterday (April 2nd). Ten directors attended, as well as Zhang Deng, the general director of the mutual aid society, and Chen Chunbao, the deputy general director. Chairman Massey reported on the need to implement emergency mutual aid to maintain the livelihoods of the unemployed members. The following key points were unanimously approved: Each member would be given one dime and five cents per day. To avoid overcrowding, they would receive three dimes every other day. When more than half of the vehicles in the Public Concession were operating again, this mutual aid would be suspended. Although the amount of money issued daily was substantial, the society believed that the matter was very important to the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers, so they would find ways to maintain it no matter what. The one dime and five cents per day per person was determined based on the opinions collected from various members in recent days.</p>
<p>Court Trial</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, Mao Guoshu and Jiang Deyuan, both from Jiangbei, rented two British Concession rickshaws from Shi Changyuan and Cao Wangao at No. 3, Zhunshun Lane, Puenjishi Road. However, Zhao Yong'an and Qian Xuen, both from Dongtai, stepped forward, blocked their way, and prevented them from pulling the rickshaws, taking away the seat cushions. Patrol Officer No. 655 of the French Concession Police reported this to the police station, and Detective Liu Jinrong was dispatched to arrest Zhao and Qian, who were sent to the First Special District Court in the afternoon. The police lawyer stated that the police were prosecuting the defendants based on the Law of Remote Justice. When questioned, Zhao and Qian confessed that they had prevented the pulling of the rickshaws but had not used violence. Judge Qiu ordered Zhao and Qian to each pay a fine of five dimes as a warning.</p>
<p>Public Concession police personnel apprehended many perpetrators of tire deflation the day before yesterday. The Chengdu Road Police Station apprehended thirteen people, the Laozha Police Station apprehended four, the Xinzha Police Station apprehended five, and the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended seven. The Hudong Yulin Road and 思威路 Police Stations also apprehended eighteen. In total, over forty people were apprehended. Yesterday morning, according to the jurisdictions of each police station, they were separately sent to the First Special District Court's Second and Fifth Criminal Courts. Police lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution based on Article 304 of the Criminal Law, accusing them of the crime of obstructing freedom by using violence and coercion to force people to do things they had no obligation to do or interfering with people's exercise of their rights. After questioning by Judges Ye Shengchao and Yang Qianchang, the deflation perpetrators were sentenced to fifteen, twenty, and thirty days of detention respectively as a warning.</p>
<p>Guild Statement</p>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Guild issued a statement, stating that rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers have a close relationship of mutual dependence and coexistence in both business and life, which is not a simple leasing relationship. However, after the establishment of the Rickshaw Committee two years ago, it was believed that the leadership of the rickshaw pullers should not belong to the merchants, but should be led by the mutual aid society, with the Rickshaw Committee being responsible for it. The rickshaw merchants protested, but to no avail. The Rickshaw Committee then organized rickshaw puller registration, and all rickshaw puller issues were under the supervision of the mutual aid society. This time, the Rickshaw Committee enforced new regulations and forcibly collected mutual aid fees. The rickshaw pullers, based on their own interests, declared their refusal to pay the mutual aid fees, which was not allowed by the Rickshaw Committee. The rickshaw merchants had no choice but to temporarily suspend business and await a resolution. As for the livelihood issue of the rickshaw pullers after the suspension, it was initially thought that since the leadership of the rickshaw pullers belonged to the mutual aid society and the mutual aid society had collected a large amount of membership fees from the rickshaw pullers, amounting to 300,000 yuan, the society would be able to comprehensively plan and provide effective relief for the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers after the suspension, which was its obligatory task. However, judging from the society's actions in the two days since the suspension, it had not made any statement regarding the issue of maintaining the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers, and had even led and directed the rickshaw pullers to engage in various excessive and destructive behaviors. According to statistics from various police stations, hundreds of incidents of disturbing order had occurred in the past two days. The guild deeply felt that if this continued, it would be concerning for social security and the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers. In addition to trying to remedy the situation within its possible scope, the guild stated that the rickshaw pullers' actions were led by the mutual aid society and the Rickshaw Committee, and the rickshaw merchants were not involved. It feared that the outside world would not understand the truth and therefore made this statement. (New Voice Society)</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Official Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting a proper solution. The original text stated: "To the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department: On April 1st, we received a letter from the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association Special District Office stating that the Rickshaw Committee suddenly notified all rickshaw owners on March 31st that it would implement new regulations from April 1st, implementing rental fee reductions and forcibly paying mutual aid fees, otherwise licenses would be revoked. The association's rickshaw owners have informed the rickshaw leaders, but the rickshaw pullers have refused to pay the mutual aid fees based on legitimate reasons, and the Rickshaw Committee is forcibly collecting them with authority. The rickshaw owners are in a dilemma, and even if they continue business as usual, they are bound to suffer heavy losses, and are at risk of being fined heavily and having their licenses revoked. Therefore, all vehicles have been forced to stop operating, and the livelihoods of national business rickshaw pullers are in dire straits. The situation is urgent and the future is worrying. In addition to continuing to negotiate with the Public Works Department based on reason, we specially present the true situation and request an investigation. We sincerely ask for prompt assistance to maintain the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people." It was reported to the association that after the rickshaws stopped operating, the rickshaw pullers lost their jobs, which was bound to affect social security. We request that your bureau quickly formulate relief measures and immediately convene representatives of rickshaw merchants to discuss a solution to prevent the situation from escalating. This is our sincere hope. (New Voice Society)</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Report</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reported: "A representative of the *North China Daily News* visited an official at the Shanghai Public Works Department General Office yesterday (April 1st). It was stated that the petition submitted by the Rickshaw Guild last week had been transferred to the Rickshaw Committee for consideration. The committee is expected to submit its decision to the Public Works Department Board of Directors within a week. Whether the Public Works Department will negotiate with the owners depends on the nature of the committee's decision. As for the national owners' request to postpone the reduction of rental fees by 7.7 cents while the dispute is unresolved, it should be known that this new rental fee was decided after much consideration and the owners were notified well in advance. It is remembered that when the rickshaw fee was revised last year, the national owners also made the same objection at the last minute and requested an extension to continue negotiations. The owners claim that the current rental reduction violates the contract signed between the owners and the Public Works Department in August of last year, which stipulated a rental fee of 8.5 cents. The speaker believes that this dispute has no sufficient reason because the Public Works Department's signing of the contract did not bind itself to maintain the rental fee for a certain period of time and not to change it at any time as needed. The owners also claim that the Public Works Department has no right to stipulate the rental fees for the three zones, namely the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Chinese territory. The French Concession and the Chinese territory are obvious facts, but the discussion refers to rickshaws that solicit business on the roads of the Public Concession, which is also obvious. The representatives of the Rickshaw Owners Guild, who went to the Public Works Department on Tuesday, were informed that the petition submitted by the branch a week ago had been transferred to the relevant authorities and that the guild would be notified of the result within two weeks. The Public Works Department does not want to discuss the petition until it receives the Rickshaw Committee's decision."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association convened its 221st joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 7:00 PM the night before last at its clubhouse at No. 572, intersection of Beile Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession. Zhang Juansheng was publicly elected as chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the minutes. The meeting proceeded as usual. The proposals were recorded below: (A) Matters for Report: The Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court ordered that the original telephone in the lawyers' lounge could be temporarily used by litigants, and the public servant in the room was responsible for collecting fees according to the number of uses. It seemed unnecessary to install a public telephone. (B) Matters for Discussion: The Shanghai District Court ordered that the request to improve the procedures for reporting changes in the hearing schedule and the execution of seizures had mostly been implemented by the court, and the methods had been clarified.

<h3 id="e115">Animal Protection Society Requests the Enactment of Animal Cruelty Prevention Regulations <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote benevolence and save people's hearts, the China Animal Protection Society has submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan requesting the enactment of articles or regulations prohibiting cruelty to animals in order to supplement the deficiencies of current laws. The original text is as follows: "We respectfully submit this petition. The protection of animals is largely governed by laws in Europe and the United States. These laws have been implemented for a long time and their effectiveness is increasing day by day. Recently, some countries have even included them in their constitutions. Benevolent voices and righteous questions are heard from afar. China was one of the earliest civilizations, and its people have always been known for benevolence and compassion. All things are equal to mankind. There are clear ancient instructions. However, in recent times, people's hearts have become shallow and evil customs have become rampant. Some people satisfy their appetites, while others seek to exploit animals for profit. They use all kinds of cruel methods to inflict pain on defenseless animals, causing injuries everywhere, which is shocking. According to Article 21 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Hunting Law currently in force in China, 'Local authorities may, depending on local conditions, formulate regulations for the protection of beneficial animals to supplement the Hunting Law and these Detailed Rules.' However, in fact, local authorities have not formulated any regulations for the protection of beneficial animals, so the original intention of the legislation cannot be promoted. When facts occur, officials at all levels use the excuse that there are no laws to rely on and do not prohibit them, or even regard it as far-fetched and laugh at it. This deeply hinders the saving of people's hearts and the elimination of violence. The work of this association is even more difficult to carry out. Therefore, we have extracted and translated one article from the British Hunting Law and one example of animal cruelty, and submitted them to your Yuan. We propose that articles prohibiting cruelty to animals be stipulated in any law, the nature of which should be proactive, or that separate regulations prohibiting cruelty to animals be enacted to supplement the deficiencies of current laws. We humbly await the decision of your Yuan for implementation. This is the great fortune of all living beings."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to Hold Spring Plowing Agricultural Loan Preparations Completed and to Begin Immediately <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In order to solve the economic difficulties of the common people, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, as a customary practice, must hold an agricultural loan at the beginning of each year's farmers' spring plowing season, so as to facilitate the common people. This year, the sowing season has arrived, and the farmers in various rural areas are in urgent need of funds, so preparations are now actively underway. The loan will be disbursed within one or two weeks at the shortest time. The person in charge of the public loan office in each rural area will issue the loan to the corresponding rural area. In addition, the first public loan office of the bureau on Zhonghua Road, Dananmen, is located in a relatively remote location, making it slightly inconvenient for the poor to borrow. Therefore, from the day before yesterday, it was specially moved to No. 142, Zhaofang Lane, Laoximen, to conduct business.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Representatives of Western Shipping Industry in Pudong Request the Construction of Public Wharves <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the western shipping industry in Pudong, submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating that it was a request to order the Public Works and Engineering Bureaus to relax the shoreline and construct the originally planned Nanhui Guild Hall public wharf to maintain transportation and benefit commerce. It stated that the businesses in the Nanshi area rely heavily on the trading of local ships and fellow villagers. From the Sixteen Pups Wharf to the Dongjiadu Wharf, a distance of three li, there are numerous wharves along the beach. Ships from various regions are assigned specific berths without confusion, which has led to prosperous commerce. This is recorded in the county chronicles and can be verified. Since the shoreline has been taken over by the city, the area from Sixteen Pups southward to Dongjiadu Wharf has been designated as a wharf area. Warehouses have been erected, blocking important passages. The original wharves along the beach have been either destroyed or merged, resulting in limited space. Ships from various regions have nowhere to dock and are scattered. This has led to changes in the Nanshi area, with empty houses lined up, affecting municipal taxes significantly. For example, the previously existing Wanyu, Yongsheng, and Dongjiadu wharves were used by ships from various towns and villages in Shanghai, Fengxian, Nanhui, and Sichuan counties, and commerce was prosperous. Now, after the destruction of the Wanyu and Yongsheng wharves, the Dongjiadu Wharf, which was built by various businesses, has been occupied by the Municipal Finance and Public Works Bureaus. As a result, ships from various villages are scattered, and the market is declining. A portion of the ships have gathered to dock at the Nanhui Guild Hall Wharf. Previously, the Public Works Bureau, together with the Public Utilities Bureau, erected magnetic signs, designating the area as a public wharf. However, the wharf has not yet been constructed, making it difficult for ships from various villages to dock, and the loading and unloading of goods is extremely dangerous. Only those who have personally experienced it can understand the hardship. Therefore, a special request is made to your office to grant permission and review the matter. The wharf is the center of cargo transportation and the lifeline of commerce. It is requested that the Public Works and Engineering Bureaus be ordered to allow the relaxation of the shoreline at the Guild Hall public wharf and to commence construction to facilitate transportation and maintain commerce. The urgency is paramount.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Leaders from Various Industries in Zhabei Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Support Wang and Publicly Requested Yu Qiaqing and Others to Continue Their Assistance and Organize a Creditor Group to Petition the Government <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, yesterday at 2 p.m., over a hundred leaders from various industries and creditors in Zhabei held a plenary meeting to support Wang. Xu Qianlin reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that Wang Bin’yan mortgaged his residence to the Guangdong Bank to raise funds to maintain local affairs during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war, and it has now been seized. The government has not yet repaid the debt, but the private residence is about to be auctioned off. The funds were used for local purposes at the time, but the bank now considers them to have other uses. He asked how to respond and requested Yin Dunfu to provide a detailed report for a public decision. Chairman Yin reported that the provincial government had stated in its approval that it was a debt issue, but no funds were allocated for repayment. The matter was then presented to the Ministry of Finance, which responded that it was a local debt and should be repaid by the provincial government. Recently, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which also approved the handling in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's original plan. Currently, Lawyer Lu Zhiyuan, representing the Guangdong Bank, has issued a statement adding the words "self-proclaimed" to the organization's name and implying ulterior motives, which is suspected of undermining the entire creditor body in Zhabei and adding insult. He asked how to handle it. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: A letter will be sent to the Guangdong Bank to inquire further (passed). A public letter will be sent to Shanghai gentry Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, and others, requesting continued assistance and petitioning the Executive Yuan in Beijing (passed). A creditor group will be organized to request the government to repay the debt, and a date will be set for a meeting (passed). A legal team will be formed to study the legal aspects of the case and the methods of proceeding (passed). The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

This year, there were 24 applications for licenses, including 4 applications for completely new licenses and 20 applications for official licenses after having previously obtained a temporary license. All of the applications were approved, except for the one at 324 East Broadway Road, which was rejected because there were already enough bars nearby. The director of the Taxation Office stated that the number of existing restaurants and bars, plus the newly licensed ones, is not significantly different from last year.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Ningbo Industrial Bank Resumption Preparations Office has received assistance from fellow villagers and people from all walks of life, and the planned resumption has been progressing smoothly. So far, it has paid out 94% of the total claims to depositors. The Ministry of Finance ordered the office to close by the end of last month. However, there are still a small number of depositors who have not been contacted due to changes of address or travel abroad. The office has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for a seven-day extension, notifying all depositors who have not yet processed their claims to bring their deposit certificates within seven days to be processed in accordance with the resumption plan approved by the Ministry of Finance. This will facilitate the closure of the payout process and facilitate the resumption of business. It is also reported that in order to develop the bank's business and solidify its foundation, the office is organizing a fundraising meeting. In addition to depositors converting 50% of their deposits into shares, new shares are being solicited from all walks of life and fellow villagers in Shanghai. As soon as the funds are raised, the bank will resume operations with the primary purpose of developing industry, aiding farmers, workers, and fishermen, and supporting domestic goods. Therefore, fellow villagers and people from all walks of life are very supportive and hope for early success.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Candle Industry Discusses Revival <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association, recognizing the industry's decline in recent years, held a general meeting of members yesterday and the day before to discuss revival strategies. The resolutions are as follows: Selling goods at low prices is self-destructive, especially during this period of rising raw material prices. A warning should be given first, followed by further adjustments. It has been found that one or two businesses are still using old scales, which not only harms fellow businesses but also violates government regulations. If found in the future, the responsible authorities should be asked to handle the matter according to the law. When fellow businesses collect leftover candle wax, it should be calculated at half price, but only for candles sold by the business itself. Members who intentionally delay or avoid paying membership fees will be directly prosecuted in accordance with the notification from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. An additional proposal was made that, on the occasion of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, various sectors are raising funds to purchase aircraft for celebration. Although the candle industry is in a state of extreme decline, it should still make a modest effort to express its respect. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<p>Lu Houfu, a 64-year-old man from Tongzhou, lived above the Dongxin Cigarette Shop opposite the small vegetable market at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Manchuria Road. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 p.m., Lu was returning home after visiting friends. When he reached the intersection of Manchuria Road and was about to cross the road from east to west, a black-plated car driven by a Westerner was speeding from west to east. Lu Houfu was in the middle of the road, unable to avoid it. The car did not brake or swerve to avoid him and continued to speed straight ahead, causing Lu Houfu to be knocked down and thrown more than ten paces. His left temple and cheekbone were broken, and he bled profusely and fainted on the spot. Fortunately, a police officer from the nearby Yulin Road police station saw the incident and immediately stopped the car, recorded the license plate number, and took the driver to the police station. The injured man was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. His condition is said to be critical.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Two Suicides <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shangzhi Dies from Poisoning. Lu Shangzhi, an employee of the Yuliang Liangxin Pharmacy in Fangbang Street, inside the city, lived at No. 2 Jindeli, Menghua Street, inside the West Gate. His wife indulged in the modern habits of Shanghai, and Lu's salary could not keep up with the high cost of living and the poor economic conditions in Shanghai. Therefore, it was difficult for him to satisfy his wife's demands, and complaints were constant. The day before yesterday, the couple quarreled over money, and his wife angrily cursed him and left, not returning until late at night. In despair, Lu felt that life was worse than death and bought a large amount of opium, which he took to commit suicide. He lay silently in bed. When the landlord did not see Lu leave the house, he became suspicious and went to peek inside. He saw that Lu's face was pale, his breathing was rapid, and his voice was hoarse. Knowing that something was wrong, he immediately notified Lu's friend, who took him to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment, but it was to no avail. The hospital reported the incident to the Wenmiao Road Police Station, which ordered the local constable Jiang Pingyang to report it to the District Court for examination.</p>
<p>Cheng Caisheng Drowns Himself. Cheng Caisheng, a 63-year-old man from Suzhou, was alone and had been unemployed for a long time. He had no fixed place to eat or sleep. In the past, he could rely on petty trading to make a living, but now, with all industries in decline, goods were expensive and sales were sluggish, making it difficult to survive. In addition to being burdened with old age and illness, he suffered physically and mentally. He decided to end his life and went to the side of the Lotus Pond of the Yuyuan Garden in the Town God Temple at 8:40 p.m. on March 31 and drowned himself in the river. The park police saw him and immediately rescued him, but he had already swallowed a lot of dirty water, and his lungs and stomach were severely damaged. He was taken to Shanghai Hospital by the police of the Town God Temple, but he died yesterday. The hospital reported the incident to the police station, which ordered the local constable Jiang Pingyang to report it to the District Court for examination. The above two suicide cases were examined by Prosecutor Zhao and Examiners Shen, who ordered that Lu Shangzhi's body be collected by his family and Cheng Caisheng's body be collected by his relatives.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 a.m. yesterday, while a family surnamed Mou at No. 4, Lane 221, Datong Road, Xinzha Road, was preparing lunch, three men suddenly entered the house on the pretext of asking for directions. One of the men wore glasses and had a cultured air. All of them spoke the Ningbo dialect. While they were talking, two of the men pulled out pistols and ordered everyone downstairs to stop and not move, driving them into a corner and assigning one bandit to guard them with a gun. The two bandits then went upstairs to the bedroom and searched the room. In a hurry, they grabbed several expensive clothes from the room and quickly came downstairs. They caught sight of a platinum ring on the hand of the victim, who was being held captive, and forced him to take it off. They then fled out of the house together. After an inspection, the total loss was estimated to be over 250 yuan. The family filed a detailed loss report with the police station and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Jiangsu Bank, in conjunction with the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Jincheng Bank, is providing small loans in Zhenjiang, ranging from a few yuan to tens of yuan, to help small business merchants. The interest rates are very low, so many small vendors apply for loans. Although the total amount of loans last year was only tens of thousands of yuan, the small loan amounts benefited many small business merchants. It is now learned that the bank is planning to expand its operations this year due to the excellent results. It is currently planning to provide similar loans in Changzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Yangtze River Customs Brokers Charter Ships for Cargo Transport <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Dissatisfied with the Six Companies' Volume Measurement System; Chartering Ning Yong Ji and Other Vessels from Treaty Ports</p>
<p>-- Both Sides Still Attempting to Negotiate a Resolution --</p>
<p>Due to the recent issue of volume measurement along the Yangtze River, customs brokers have revolted, expressing their unacceptability to the Six Companies. Simultaneously, various customs brokers have chartered their own ships, sailing between Shanghai and Hankou, intending to demonstrate their resolute attitude. The Six Companies have been holding meetings for days to discuss this matter, and the situation is quite serious. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Volume Measurement Issue: Since the Six Companies implemented the public sharing of costs, cargo water transport fees along the Yangtze River have increased, and commissions have decreased. Customs brokers and clients have always had standard size limits for packed goods. For example, a certain type of cargo box would be charged according to a certain number of feet, with a fixed limit. However, clients often privately increased the box area but still paid the original water transport fee. The shipping companies, due to excessive hidden losses, began to implement actual volume measurement for packed goods.</p>
<p>Request for Accommodation: There are dozens of customs brokerages in Shanghai along the Yangtze River. The Six Companies' volume measurement issue has aroused great opposition. Once fees are charged according to measured volume, the customs brokers will be unable to maintain their business. Therefore, a general meeting was convened to resolve this matter through the customs broker's association. Each executive committee member sent a letter to the Six Companies, requesting that the pressure on volume-measured goods not be excessive, and that some leniency be given. For example, a 30-foot box originally made as 12 feet could be changed to 20 feet to show the client's concession. The shipping companies discussed the matter extensively but were unable to accept it.</p>
<p>Each Side Moves to Extremes: The Six Companies have already entrusted foreigners from the Pingzhun Company to implement volume measurement and collect fees based on the actual measured amount. However, clients and customs brokers have become even more opposed. In addition to a large quantity of goods such as metals and sugar being reloaded onto ships of the Xiangtai Foreign Firm, which is not part of the public sharing system, it was originally planned that the customs brokers and clients would jointly form a shipping company to fundamentally avoid loading ships of the Six Companies. Later, due to a lack of dock cargo warehousing and other tools, various customs brokerages chartered merchant vessels such as Yongji, Malai, and Funing, sailing the Yangtze River themselves. They have already started services, determined to sail fully loaded. In addition, with the Six Companies' water transport fee of $12.60 per ton, these several vessels specially reduce the fee to $6 per ton, and can also offer a 10% discount for actual payment.</p>
<p>Final Consultation: Since then, the Six Companies' upstream cargo transportation has inevitably been affected, and future business is feared to be impacted. The Six Companies have convened meetings on this matter repeatedly, already reaching three decisions. Yesterday afternoon, they were discussing this matter again. It is heard that the Six shipping companies can generally express concessions regarding volume-measured goods, calculating the fee at 80%. For example, a 30-foot box can be charged as 24 feet (usually 40 feet is considered one ton). After the agreement is reached, they will contact the customs brokers again, hoping for a peaceful resolution between both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Ming Wah Bank Declared Bankrupt; Creditors' Meeting Held Yesterday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Branches in Various Locations Can Hold Creditors' Meetings Locally; Future Distribution of Assets and Liabilities Must Be Centralized in Shanghai</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: After the head office of Ming Wah Bank on Beijing Road and the Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao Main Branch, North Branch, and Beiping Branch simultaneously closed on May 23rd last year, creditors such as Lu Junfen filed a petition to the First Special District Local Court, requesting a declaration of the bank's bankruptcy. The court accepted the petition and ruled accordingly. Subsequently, in December last year, the First Creditors' Meeting was convened, but due to the failure of branches in various locations to send representatives to Shanghai to attend, auditors and other positions could not be elected. These circumstances were reported in the press. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Second Creditors' Meeting was convened. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Creditor Attendance: Yesterday's creditors' meeting was held in the meeting room of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Attending were 209 creditors, including Wang Jian'e, Le Junfen, Zhou Ziheng, Tang Mao Guan, and Xin Ji, representing a total debt of $187,787.18 (the registered number of creditors in Shanghai was 658, with a total debt of $640,000).</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Two people, Judge Yu Lude of the First Special Court and bankruptcy administrator accountant An Shao Yun, served as the presidium. Court clerk Ying Yeping served as the recorder. First, Judge Yu reported that the First Creditors' Meeting had no results due to the failure of branches in various locations to send representatives to Shanghai to attend. After careful study by the court, it was decided that Shanghai and the branch offices in various localities could convene creditors' meetings separately on the spot, but that the asset distribution and debt apportionment in the future would have to be centralized in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Election of Auditors: After Judge Yu finished reporting, accountant An Shao Yun reported the number of registered creditors and the amount of debt in Shanghai, as well as the number of attendees and the amount of debt at today's meeting (as seen above). He then discussed the general situation of the bank's liabilities and assets. Finally, discussions began, and creditors' representatives Le Junfen and Wang Jian'e successively expressed their opinions, which can be divided into two points: 1. According to Article 122 of the Bankruptcy Law, the debtor should attend the creditors' meeting. 2. The bank's accounts are unclear, and the creditors all want to file lawsuits. The reason they haven't filed lawsuits is due to a lack of litigation fees. They should request the court to grant litigation assistance according to the provisions of the Civil Code to show sympathy for the creditors. After the chairman answered and the case was recorded and filed, five auditors were elected. After the votes were tallied and counted, Le Junfen, Zhou Ziheng, Tang Mao Guan, Zhou Lun Yuan, and Wang Jian'e were elected. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Former Land Bureau Director Jin Liren's Family Undergoes Turmoil <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>His Wife, Lu Canjuan, Sues for Separation; Jin Accuses Lu of Often Staying Out Overnight</p>
<p>Former Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Director Jin Liren, 30 years ago, was a handsome and unrestrained young man who frequented pleasure quarters. He met the famous courtesan Zhu Xueqing (now Jin's wife, Lu Canjuan). Elegant scholar and beautiful woman, they pledged their love and began living together in the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Their love was single-minded and unwavering for 30 years, living harmoniously, a truly admirable and happy marriage. Unexpectedly, Jin Liren is now 53 years old, and Lu Canjuan is 51 years old. In their twilight years, instead of enjoying the blessings of retirement, they are following the example of young couples today and engaging in divorce litigation. Initially, Lu Canjuan filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, seeking a divorce from Jin Liren, citing that Jin had another lover. However, the case was rejected for lack of jurisdiction. Lu Canjuan then hired lawyer Ling Qihong to file a complaint with the Nanshi Local Court, changing the request to separation and requesting a lump-sum payment of $30,000 in alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Han Jingdou of the Local Court opened a mediation hearing. Jin Liren and Lu Canjuan did not attend; their agent lawyer Ling represented them in court. Regarding the reasons for requesting mediation, it was stated that they married in the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign, with a matchmaker. For more than 30 years, their relationship was harmonious. Recently, Jin's financial situation improved, while she aged and lost her beauty. Therefore, he secretly took a Cantonese woman named Mai as a concubine. To the woman who suffered with him, she was nothing more than a thorn in his eye, suffering unbearable abuse. Therefore, she requested separation and requested an order for a lump-sum payment of $30,000 in alimony. Jin Liren, accompanied by his hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai, stated in court that his first wife had passed away long ago, and Lu Canjuan was originally Zhu Xueqing from a Shanghai brothel. They had lived together for 30 years, and their relationship was generally good. Until a few years ago, Lu suddenly changed her behavior, often staying out overnight, taking away valuable clothing, jewelry, antiques, etc. She falsely claimed to go to Hangzhou with her cousin Zhou Shuan for business. She suddenly filed for divorce in the First Special Court, but the case was rejected due to jurisdictional issues. Now, she is falsely requesting separation in this case. I have lived with her for 30 years and have never heard of this relative named Zhou. Moreover, it has been found that Zhou is Feng Zimei, alias Hedongsheng, from the record of singing fruit rewards. Outside rumors slander me as a cuckold. After decades of marriage, she changed her mind when she already knew her fate, leading to an unfortunate event. My reputation has been completely ruined, and I am extremely heartbroken. I have already pursued the matter with the Special Court. As for her not being my legal wife, she is not legally bound and is free to leave in her later years. The court determined that mediation could not be established and ordered her to file a formal lawsuit.</p>

They will stay in Shanghai for one day and then go to Beijing and Tianjin. The ship also has exhibition rooms for crafts, art, and fine arts, welcoming people from all walks of life to visit. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Group Members Arrive in Shanghai: The World Liner, especially the Reliance of Hengbao Company, is visiting Shanghai for the first time. The ship departed from New York, carrying a total of 232 world tour group members. It first passed through Europe and then through the South Seas Islands to Shanghai. The ship entered the port last night, but the group members did not go ashore that night, so it was changed to 8:00 AM this morning, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf.</p>
<p>Touring the City: The Shanghai Hengbao Company has pre-planned the tour itinerary for each group member upon their arrival in Shanghai. When they disembarked at 8:00 AM in the morning, they immediately boarded 70 Xiang Sheng cars, hired to visit Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Longhua, and other places. At noon, they will rest and have lunch at the Race Course Hotel. In the afternoon, they are scheduled to tour the British and French Concessions by rickshaw, but since the rickshaw pullers are on strike, they may switch to cars.</p>
<p>Heading North Tomorrow Morning: Each person will stay in Shanghai for one day and return to the ship that night. The ship will leave Shanghai tomorrow morning and head to Qinhuangdao. The group members will go to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places for sightseeing, and some will go to the Great Wall.

The reception time is from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM today.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Xu Qizhong's Extravagance and Debauchery Reach Extremes; Banquets Cost Over a Thousand Dollars, and a Night of Dancing Reaches a Hundred Dollars; Car Horns with Nine Different Sounds, Extravagant Actions Too Numerous to List <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>--Creditors Oppose Bankruptcy, Seeking Punishment for Squandering--</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of wealthy merchant Xu Guannan, is only 22 years old. He is a typical纨绔子弟 (spoiled rich kid) who excels in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. Relying on his parents' indulgence, he does not engage in production but treats gold like dirt. When his spending runs out and he can no longer conjure wealth, he borrows from all directions. Cunning people, knowing that he is the son of a wealthy family, are happy to lend to him, but expect him to repay several times the amount in the future. For example, last winter, Wang Pingzhong (i.e., Wang Bingzong, Wang Pingjia, Wang Xinchu) attempted to swindle tens of thousands of dollars from Xu but failed. He instead accused Xu of</p>
<p>Forging a Bill: The First Special District Local Court held a clear trial and found Xu innocent. Meanwhile, the prosecutor investigated the reasons for Wang's false accusation and filed a public prosecution against Wang. Currently, Wang has escaped without a trace, so the case has not yet been opened for trial. However, Xu knows that there are many loan receipts where he borrowed one thousand and repaid ten thousand. The debts from eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling are even greater. Since it is difficult to ask his parents to repay them on his behalf, and there is no platform to escape debt, he submitted a petition to the First Special Court,</p>
<p>Requesting Bankruptcy: The court has already convened a creditors' meeting for him, but it has not been successful. Now, the auditor hired by the creditors, lawyer Le Junwei, has thoroughly reviewed his debts, and most are due to squandering. If he is allowed to declare bankruptcy, it will not only cause great losses to legitimate creditors but also encourage extravagance and debauchery. Therefore, creditors such as Sincere Company, Syntong Motor Car Company, Shih Ho Jewelry Company, Jinlong Hotel, and the woman Hu Meiying, jointly hired lawyer Le Junwei to file a</p>
<p>Criminal Private Prosecution: Briefly stated, Xu is the only son of Xu Guannan, a wealthy merchant from Wuxing. Although young, he does not know about farming. He creates a den of consumption on the sea, indulging in sensual pleasures and extravagant entertainment. He enjoys everything that exhausts the luxury of food and clothing, reaching the peak of debauchery. Therefore, dinners at the Atlantic cost over a thousand dollars, and a night of dancing at the Paramount costs a hundred dollars. Other examples include keeping beauties in golden houses and seeking new-style furniture. Spending a thousand dollars on smiles requires fashionable clothing. Therefore, Hongxiang Company,</p>
<p>Gaohe Women's Shoes: Store, Shih Ho Jewelry Store, Zou Juxing Clothing Store, Yiyuan Furniture Company, Jinlong Hotel, Sincere Company, St. Anna Dance Hall, Daxia Motor Car Company, etc., are owed hundreds to more than two thousand dollars. His own car has nine different horns and is equipped with a long and short-wave wireless radio. All these decorations are unique in Shanghai. Other extravagant actions are too numerous to list. There is also the owner of the Wendi Brothel, Zheng Huizhen, to whom the defendant once owed a common hall fee of one thousand dollars. Because he had no funds to repay, he gave her a loan receipt for 10,000 yuan. This shows that the defendant is willing to squander, truly</p>
<p>An Innovation of Spoil Rich Son: It is a bad example for young people and a parasite on society. He is using his intelligence and deceit, falsely declaring bankruptcy, hoping to evade debt and damage creditor rights. He has already constituted the crime stipulated in Article 154, paragraph 1, of the Bankruptcy Law, detrimental to the rights of creditors, and Article 156, paragraph 1, of squandering. Therefore, we request that the defendant be arrested, strictly interrogated, and punished, and ordered to repay Sincere Company $2,659.60, Syntong Company $298.75, Hu Meiying $1,500, Shih Ho $200, and Jinlong $121.95. According to the statement, the court has already issued a summons to the defendant to appear in court this Saturday afternoon to await investigation.</p>

<p>Continued Trial on the 4th of This Month</p>
<p>Fan Qiu, the daughter-in-law of Fan Huichun (i.e., the daughter of wealthy paint merchant Qiu Weiqing), accused her husband, Fan Chunsheng, of adultery in the French Concession Police Station. They were caught red-handed and handed over to the Second Special District Court. Because neither party attended, the lawyers representing Fan Qiu, Zhang Deqin, and Fan Chunsheng, Wu Baodi, agreed to postpone the hearing. This has been reported in the press. It is now learned that although the relatives of both parties have tried their best to mediate, and according to those familiar with the Fan family's situation, the name of the protagonist of the adultery case is Little Diamond, that is, Fan's favorite concubine, a girl from Guilin known as Oil Bottle. At home, she addresses Chunsheng as brother and sister. Years ago, she was once engaged to the son of rice merchant Gu, but the marriage did not happen. Since her relationship with Chunsheng, Qiu has been suspicious. However, the father-in-law saw through the hidden situation and, for the sake of consolidating the family reputation and succession, ordered his son to go to Dongying (Japan) with his daughter-in-law to study, hoping to cut off the love affair in one fell swoop, achieving two goals at once. Who knew that Qiu was not accustomed to living abroad, and Chunsheng did not dare to disobey his father's orders by going alone. After a few months, they returned to Shanghai. There were many obstacles at home, and they persuaded Little Diamond to obtain her mother's consent to rent a small building on Rue Sainte Marie, where they lived together. Chunsheng only sees his wife Qiu every few days, and marital pleasure is like a nominal affair. However, Qiu still believed that her father-in-law still had some regard for her. Recently, because her father-in-law changed his attitude and stood on the same line as his son, he suddenly ordered his daughter-in-law Qiu to move out and live separately. Qiu was extremely angry, and soon, the act of catching adultery was plotted. It is now heard that the case has been scheduled for a continued trial on the 4th of this month. Qiu's relatives are afraid that there will be many spectators, and it is heard that they have entrusted someone to pre-distribute spectator tickets to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Three Robbers Extremely Lawless; Plot to Rob Constable's Gun <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Gun Not Taken, Head Broken; Two Robbers Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>Constable Ge Yunjin, 28 years old, from Yancheng, of the Sicoge Guard on Route Lafayette 285, Ruihua Lane, was on duty yesterday morning around 1:00 AM. Suddenly, three robbers came, using knocking on the door to inquire about information as a reason, and rushed into the lane. Each of them took out iron bars and beat Ge, and tried to take the pistol he was wearing. Fortunately, Ge held it tightly with both hands, so it was not taken. Ge's head was struck with three holes, blood flowed all over his face, and he fell to the ground. The group scattered. At that time, an engineer happened to pass by the place and, feeling indignant on his behalf, chased them to the intersection of Avenue Petain and Route Cardinal Mercier. He caught one robber and notified the police to take him to the police station. According to the robber, his name is Pan Zhiyun, 24 years old, from Jintan, living at No. 26 Delong Lane, Route Robert, and working as a set builder at the Weiyang Grand Theater. His accomplice, Cao Ziqing (25 years old, from Haimen), lives at No. 2 Longxing Lane, Route Contaut. After obtaining the confession, the police chief ordered detectives to go to the address and arrest Cao. He confessed that Zhang Zhifeng, who is still at large, instructed them to go to rob a pistol, intending to rob someone's family. The rest of the confession was evasive. They were ordered to be detained, pending investigation and delivery to the court for interrogation. Detectives were also ordered to investigate the robbery situation and send the injured person to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Neck Cut Once, Esophagus Fortunately Not Severed</p>
<p>Chen Longgen, 43 years old, from Nantong, used to live in Sanyi Township, his hometown, and worked as a farmer. He had a small amount of savings and his family was considered to be moderately wealthy. Last winter, the township was suddenly washed by a large group of bandits. Chen's house was burned down, and his wife and children were shot dead. Chen felt the tragedy of his family's destruction and suffered a great mental shock. He would sometimes cry and sometimes laugh. After medical treatment, the illness began to improve slightly. Chen came to Shanghai to seek work, but without success. Yesterday afternoon at 4:38 PM, Chen went to the Jiucai Restaurant opened by Wu Lianhui, a native of Chongming, at No. 50, Laozhen Street, Hongzhen, Zhabei. He called for wine and dishes and drank alone. Wine entered his sad bowels, and resentment was difficult to dissipate. He suddenly conceived the idea of ending his life, pushed away the cup, quietly took a knife for cutting vegetables from the restaurant, aimed it at his neck, and slashed hard. The restaurant owner, Wu Lianhui, caught a glimpse of it and stepped forward to grab the knife. Chen was already injured and collapsed, bleeding profusely. Wu reported the situation to the Hongzhen Police Station and summoned an ambulance. Police officer Zhao Yushu rushed Chen to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was not light, but fortunately, the esophagus was not severed and his life was not in danger.</p>

<p>— Edited by China Zheng</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview No. 20)</p>
<p>3. The Woolen Manufacturing Industry in this Port</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the woolen fabrics sold in our country are still dominated by imported goods. Therefore, there are not many people engaged in manufacturing in this port, and the scale is small. Now, only Zhanghua and China Weiyi, two relatively large companies, will be introduced later. In addition, if there are three companies, Huadong, Tianxiang, and Hongfa, that specialize in making camel hair, they will be attached together because of their large scale and relevance to this article, for the reference of those who are enthusiastic about the national goods movement:</p>
<p>1. Zhanghua Wool Spinning and Weaving Company - The factory was established in October of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Capital of 800,000 yuan. A general factory was established in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, Shanghai, and a branch factory was established in Tianjin. It was founded by Liu Hongsheng, the former general manager of the China Merchants Bureau. Mr. Liu currently serves as chairman and general manager. There are currently 70 weaving machines and 2,200 wool spinning machines, some of which are old machines from the former Rihui Port No. 1 Wool Weaving Factory, and some were ordered from Belgium. There are currently 6700 workers, and most of the raw materials are sourced from within China. The products are mostly thin serge, military uniform fleece, and patterned fleece, which are sold in this port and throughout the country. The annual turnover reaches more than 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>2. China Weiyi Wool Spinning and Weaving Factory - The factory was established in the 8th year of the Republic of China. It was initially opened by Mr. Li Ansu with his own investment. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, foreign shares were added and it was reorganized into a limited company. It was reorganized again in the 17th year, stipulating a capital of 60,000 taels of silver, and the organization was changed to unlimited. Ju Tang, the son of shareholder Xu Linfu, serves as the manager. The factory site is located at No. 170, Xiaoshadu Road. There are 16 machines of various sizes in the factory, with a total of 160 employees. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it acquired the Danan Camel Hair Factory on Radu Road and expanded its scope. Its products are divided into three types: woolen fabrics, woolen yarn, and camel hair. Branch offices have been established in Suzhou and Hangzhou, and there are several managers in Beiping and Beijing to promote sales.</p>
<p>3. Huadong Wool Weaving and Camel Hair Factory - The factory is a partnership organization established in January of the 20th year of the Republic of China with a capital of 50,000 yuan. The shareholders include Chen Youyun and Zhang Zhongliang, with Chen Jun concurrently serving as the manager. The factory is located at No. 156, Alabaster Road, with eight weaving machines, one fleece machine, and one hundred male and female workers and fifteen or sixteen employees. Specializing in weaving various camel hair.</p>
<p>4. Tianxiang Camel Hair Weaving Factory - The factory was established in the 17th year of the Republic of China with a capital of 50,000 yuan, which was increased to 100,000 yuan in the 20th year. It is a joint-stock company, with Shen Dehua, Rong Tingquan, etc. as directors, Shen Zhuming, Lin Ruiting, etc. as supervisors, and Fan Lianqin as manager. The manufacturing department is located at No. 343, Xujiahui Road, and the business department is located at No. 48, Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road. There are twelve camel hair machines and more than 180 male and female workers, which can produce more than 30 camel hair codes per year. Because there are no suitable wool threads in China, most of the raw materials are purchased from abroad and ordered by various foreign firms in this port. The main sales areas are this port and the Yangtze River basin.</p>
<p>5. Hongfa Woolen Weaving Factory - The factory is located at No. 1741 and a half, Labor Shen Road, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. It was initially operated as a partnership by Li Changzuo, Wu Pinrui, etc. It was reorganized in June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China and operated solely by Wu Pinrui. Later, Mr. Li Yunxun joined the cooperation, so its organization is still a partnership. Mr. Li is currently the manager. There are ten machines and a set of steel wire machines in the factory, employing about one hundred workers. It can produce about one thousand yards of camel hair per day. It is said that the raw materials are waste hair and self-made wool yarn.</p>

<p>From Preliminary Selection to Departure</p>
<p>For the preliminary selection, the National Sports Association specially sent Rong Qizhao as a representative to Hong Kong in advance to preside over everything. The preliminary selection will be held from the 4th to the 10th, and the thirty candidates will take turns to play in the matches, and then select the official representatives. The team will then continue to practice in Hong Kong. The scheduled order is: 18th against Hong Kong Military United, 19th against the Mixed Team, and the 24th the whole team will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong. It is scheduled to play another match in Shanghai. The date has been set for the 25th, 26th, and 29th. The original date for departure was May 7th, but because the contract with Java was set for the 15th, the team could not depart early. The team was then rescheduled to depart from Shanghai on May 2nd on the French mail ship Jean Laborp, which will detour to Saigon before heading to the South Seas. The team is required to arrive in Dutch Java by May 15th, and then transfer to Singapore, Penang, Siam, Yangon, Calcutta, and then to Germany. The team will compete with local strong teams in each port along the way to gain practice. As for the track and field, basketball, swimming, boxing, weightlifting and other athletes and staff who will attend the World Games, they are scheduled to depart around June 20th.</p>
<p>Shanghai Players Departed Yesterday</p>
<p>Six players from this port and Tan Fuzhen from North China took the McKinley yesterday morning to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong. Zhou Jiaqi, Chen Zhenhe, Zhang Rongcai, and Liang Shutang first crossed the Pujiang River at about 8 o'clock and boarded the ship. The three players, Li Ning, Sun Jinshun, and Youliang, took a passenger ship from the Xinguang Pier at 9:45 to cross the Pujiang River. Those who came to the port to see them off included Guo Zhenheng, Zhang Rongguang, Zhang Zizhen, Chen Shao, Hu Borong, Sun Jizhuang, Li Yichen, Chen Zhenxiang, Jia Jiliang, Huo Zhenghong, Zhou Jiaqi's wife, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers. The ship started at 11:00 AM from the Bailianjing Pier and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow morning. The players are staying in rooms 2, 36, 41, and 42.</p>
<p>It is Said that the List of Personnel Has Been Predetermined</p>
<p>According to a certain gentleman from the relevant department, the skills of the thirty people who participated in the preliminary competition are all comparable, and it is particularly difficult to select the skills. As for attending the World Games, there is naturally no hope to be expected, but to complete the long-cherished wish of a tour of Europe. During the long journey of thousands of miles, the players' spirits must also feel extremely painful. According to another source, the official list of selected players has long been drawn up. It is feared that only Sun Jinshun and Chen Zhenhe from Shanghai will be selected. Tan Fuzhen from North China also has hope of being selected due to certain relationships. This kind of rumor is of course not believable. The entire Chinese team's players must be the most outstanding members of the whole country. According to Wang Zhengting, this selection focuses on personal skills and promising new talents.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Amidst Calls for Developing the Northwest, Shanxi Education Makes Rapid Progress <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Increase budget allocations to expand new endeavors, rectify local education to strengthen secondary education, implement specialized education, and conduct civic training.</p>
<p>In recent years, all construction undertakings in Shaanxi have seen rapid progress. In terms of education, the expansion and improvement of quantity and quality are no longer what they used to be. In the area of school education, Shaanxi was in a state of stagnation due to the continuous disasters of the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China. Since Zhou Xuechang took charge of the Department of Education, he has tried to restore existing facilities and formulate a plan to gradually increase the budget allocation to seek the development of emerging industries. Therefore, in recent years, elementary schools have shown considerable achievements. The province, feeling the unevenness of elementary school teachers, established an elementary school teacher training institute to select teachers from various counties for short-term training, improve their teaching methods, and increase their knowledge so that they can continue to improve and not be outdated. Furthermore, the institute has also set up classes for administrative personnel and social education personnel to strive for the improvement of local educational administration and the advancement of social education. In the past one or two years, the students of the institute have been assigned to various counties and have been able to make special efforts. As for the annual summer seminars held in various districts, strict examination of elementary school textbooks, compilation of local supplementary reading materials by county, and the implementation of district inspections are all necessary measures for the promotion of elementary education. In the province's secondary education, middle schools focus on the cultivation of national culture, normal schools focus on professional training, and vocational schools are numerous. Last year, with the increase in provincial funding, the Provincial Department of Education purchased a large number of instruments worth nearly 100,000 yuan based on the current situation of each school, distributed them to the schools to enrich equipment, registered teachers, formulated specific standards for various courses and teaching progress, reviewed textbooks for various subjects to improve teaching, promulgated implementation plans for moral education in secondary normal schools and vocational schools, compiled brief biographies of local worthies, held scientific lectures, and implemented strict management to rectify the academic atmosphere, gradually promoting its effectiveness. Recently, due to the disturbances caused by the Red Bandits in northern Shaanxi, the youth have been anesthetized by them and their minds are chaotic. It is necessary to implement specialized education in Yulin Middle School and Suide Normal School. In the original curriculum, specialized education materials will be added by subject, in order to bring students' thoughts and actions into the right track, so that they can set an example and serve as teachers for Sun Yat-sen's civil schools in the future. This kind of facility is extremely important, and the provincial government has passed its methods and rules and issued them for implementation. The department plans to extend specialized education to the northern and southern regions in the next year in order to expand its scope and lay the foundation for the Three Principles of the People education. As for social education, the province has recently conducted civic training very actively. The provincial capital stipulates that each household must select an adult between the ages of 25 and 50 for training. The training period is set at three months, with half a day of training every Sunday. The subjects include civic knowledge, civic songs, strict training, and spiritual lectures. The implementing agencies are the Provincial Department of Education, the Provincial Government's Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Northwest Political Training Office, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, which jointly form the Provincial Capital Civic Training Committee to promote it. All citizens' training is conducted in a completely compulsory education manner. The first phase has started with 32 sessions and 50 classes. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. This type of facility is a pioneering effort in the Northwest, and is also an emerging undertaking in the country. The Provincial Department of Education plans to complete the provincial civic training within one year and then promote its implementation in other counties. The provinces in the Northwest have heard of this and are sending personnel to the province to observe and imitate it.</p>

Xinfeng Yangxing cleared the US dollar and sold the Japanese yen, arbitraging the June exchange rate, which was still 28.94 yuan. It was calm in the middle, and the situation gradually improved. Chinese merchants slightly cleared the forward US dollar, and it was mediocre in the end. At the close, the near-term selling price was 1 shilling, 2.5 pence for the British exchange rate, and 30 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was tight by 0.03125 and flat for the US exchange rate compared to the previous close, respectively. The forward exchange rate was flat for the British exchange rate and loose by 0.0625 for the US exchange rate. The day's transaction prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e186">Securities: Major Players Bullishly Boosting, Government Bonds Rebounding Strongly <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a resurgence in market conditions, seemingly still due to the old trick of maneuvering. However, the rapid and substantial rebound made its foundation unstable, showing a floating and insubstantial appearance. It is feared that it will tread the path of a large number of bullish investors who advance sharply and retreat quickly. They have been thinking about selling for a long time but have not had the opportunity. Suddenly encountering a downturn, they are also in a dilemma, so they rise up and re-engage in heavy boosting. Observing each trading session, whenever the market price weakens and trading gradually softens, they immediately take practical action. The amount is limited, and they can raise the price by one or two cents, using little effort and achieving great success. However, this most easily makes people aware of their painstaking efforts and take advantage to attack. If they avoid the initial momentum and do not go against the wind, and wait for the price to fall to a considerable level and the market sentiment to stabilize, then taking practical action will feel powerful. At the same time, retail investors can start to make up for their losses. Yesterday, head-on obstruction will ultimately be difficult to sustain, making the market more susceptible to setbacks. On the environmental front, the competition between factions has already evolved into an undesirable situation. Germany's attitude towards 〇〇 is undoubtedly strong. Internally, the budget is insufficient, with a significant difference. Furthermore, the issue of tax increases in North China has no salvage plan. The future of the bond market is difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday's proceedings began with a rather weak opening. There was quite a bit of selling in the No. 6 and No. 11 bonds, continuing to fall by three or four cents. Starting with the long-term domestic bonds, there were purchases of No. 4 and No. 35 bonds, and Zhang Hang raised the price, which slightly boosted people's confidence. Three households also engaged in making up for their losses, so the later bonds rebounded by three or four cents. This kind of rebound should be the expected trend. In the second session, No. 4, No. 35 level, and No. 49 bonds were boosted with all their might. Class D bonds surged by 6.5 cents. No. 16 and No. 54 bonds saw quite a bit of selling, and Class B bonds were slightly smaller by 1.5 cents. When the afternoon session opened, retail investors continued to make up for their losses, rising by three or four cents. However, whenever each type of bond was weak and listless, No. 4 and others immediately bought in, enabling them to stabilize. At the close, most of the major players felt satisfied. The front bonds rebounded by another two cents, and the later bonds had turned weak. Once they were in line with the spread, they again tended towards quietude. As a result, the market price rose sharply across the board, ranging from 45 cents to 75 cents. The total transaction volume was 6,410,000. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The New China Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 1st), the New York stock market advanced across the board under the leadership of industrial stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a new high since 1931. Railroad stocks also rose in tandem, with the largest gains reaching two dollars. Utility stocks rose less strongly. Steel stocks also rose due to increased steel production. Agricultural equipment stocks soared sharply. Stocks on the small exchange rose slightly. On the bond market side, industrial corporate bonds rose slightly, and government bonds were mixed. The total daily transaction volume was 1,690,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Overseas yarn and cotton declines affect the market. Spot sales are stagnant, and confidence is waning.</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the situation is softening, because overseas yarn and cotton conditions have turned downward, further discouraging confidence. Moreover, industry players have more than 27,900 bales of cotton yarn in warehouses. There is still a lack of movement of this cotton yarn, and the sentiment is idle. However, the amount absorbed by the banking sector has not been fully relinquished.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Market Dull</p>
<p>The auction yarn market opened weak in the morning session, and the market situation was dull. In addition, overseas cotton fell, and confidence was dim. Sellers were actively selling, and He Xing Run Kang came to add to the selling pressure. However, Tong Ji Yi Chang bought in and bullish investors added to their positions, and the second and third sessions rebounded slightly. As a result, each month's closing price fell by 0.89 cents to 1.1 dollars compared to the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, each month was still not good, and the atmosphere in the market was worse due to the decline in Osaka Sanpin yarn. As a result, each month's price fell by 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 cents compared to the morning session's closing price. It was found that Da Fu sold 450 bales, Mei Ji sold 450 bales, He Xing sold 2,250 bales, Gu Da sold 400 bales, Run Kang sold 2,150 bales, Yong Da sold 600 bales, Shen Ji sold 400 bales, and Sheng Yuan sold 450 bales. De Da bought 400 bales, Tong Ji bought 1,950 bales, Da Ji bought 650 bales, Jin Chang bought 650 bales, Yi Chang bought 2,250 bales, and Chang Feng bought 750 bales. Da Chang bought 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Prices Fall by About One Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that various groups bought a total of 712 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell by 0.5 to 1 dollar. The buying amount of each capital is as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market has retreated because American cotton has turned downward, and confidence is waning. Generally, cotton merchants, because the current cotton mills need to be stagnant, hold the view of selling when prices rise. However, Tong Ji is not only unwilling to release large amounts but also continues to buy, showing the intensity of the competition between the two sides.</p>
<p>Auction Cotton Falls by Five Yuan in Each Month</p>
<p>The auction cotton market opened in the morning session, and American cotton closed positions, falling by 7 to 18 points. Indian cotton demand was normal, rising slightly by 0.25 to 1.5 rupees. Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 0.45 dollars. Market confidence was weak, and there were few buyers in the market. It was also rumored that spot cotton would be delivered, because each factory has been consuming little recently, and the cotton market is bearish. The price of cotton for each month broke through the five-yuan mark across the board. As a result, the price for each month fell by 0.2 to 0.3 dollars compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, the situation became even more panicked, and short sellers increased their positions one after another. However, Tong Ji still bought in the near months. As a result, the price for each month fell by 0.15 to 0.25 dollars compared to the morning session's closing price. It was found that Da Feng sold 2,300 piculs, Xin 〇〇 sold 1,400 piculs, Yi Kang sold 2,700 piculs, Tong Fu sold 1,300 piculs, Geng Feng sold 1,900 piculs, Chang Yu sold 1,100 piculs, Da 〇〇 Cheng sold 1,000 piculs, and Chang Feng sold 1,300 piculs. Sheng Yuan sold 300 piculs. De Da bought 1,100 piculs, Yuan Ji bought 1,100 piculs, Shen Ji bought 2,300 piculs, Tai Chang bought 1,100 piculs, Chang He bought 2,100 piculs, Jin Chang bought 1,600 piculs, and Run Kang bought 1,100 piculs. Yi Chang bought 2,200 piculs. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for each day are listed below:</p>
<p>Current Cotton Consumption Remains Slow</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is still sluggish, and factory needs are stagnant. The sources are Yao Hua 420 bales and Tong Hua 300 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened, with each month falling by 1 to 6 points. There was profit-taking in the old cotton and October contracts. News from Liverpool was unfavorable. The news of the 1.2-cent loan from Washington favored sellers, and the market was weak. During the price decline, traders including Japanese firms were the only buyers. However, the general bullish investors were very uneasy about the lack of progress in Washington. The new cotton had a slight price drop. The western rain was useless and still firm, but gradually the profit-taking made it weaker. The cash price fell 16 points, and the future price fell 8-18 points. English cotton cash rose 3 points, and futures fell 45 points. There were not many new buyers of Indian cotton, and old bulls cashed in. Demand was flat. The price of Ping Guo Er rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 0.5-1 rupees. Original telegraph recording left (1st telegram):</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the predicted opening price for the second day of Bai Luo Xi cotton was 197 rupees, down 1.5 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>

<p>After opening in the morning, the flour market presented a flat and sluggish state. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were slightly better in Chicago, with the nearby month up 2 cents and the forward month up 4.8 cents, and Canada up 0.8-1 cents. At the opening, because the weather was warming and there were signs of sunshine, and because northern merchants were slightly selling, the near- and far-term sentiments were uniformly sluggish, falling by about 1 cent compared to the previous day's closing price. When the afternoon session opened, trading turned quieter, and because factories did not release prices, sentiment stabilized slightly, rebounding by 0.5 cents compared to the morning. If the wheat seedlings can germinate smoothly in a timely manner, the market will not be too tight.</p>
<p>The flour exchange will be closed from the 3rd to the 4th due to the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>The wheat market was generally quiet. Although the quoted prices for foreign wheat were slightly better, the market had fallen sharply the previous day, and the market could not help but be concerned. In addition, the weather was already good, and outside buyers had stopped. The opening price was down 0.1-0.5 cents. When the afternoon session opened, trading became smoother, and the market presented a rotary state. However, market participants speculate that only when there is a guarantee that new wheat will be harvested in the ground, will the producers be willing to sell forward. Only then can there be talk of honor or disgrace. The current wheat market is still stable. The opening price for Dongyao Hong wheat was 5.35 yuan, a total of more than 2,000 bags, which were handled by the Fu 〇〇 and Shen three companies.</p>
<p>Although the weather in Chicago wheat is slightly better today, it is still questionable whether it will benefit the crop. The weather station predicts that it will rain again. If it does not happen, the market will continue to rise. The 倍乃 Co. estimates the winter wheat harvest to be 54.3 million 〇〇.</p>

<p>(Shanghai Liang) Yesterday, a total of more than 20 sources arrived from various groups (a total of more than 4,000 shi). Sales in this street were flat, and chartering was also suddenly quiet. Only the Yantai 〇〇 handled three shipments of Dao, totaling more than 400 bags, so the market was quiet. However, the market price generally failed to open, and it was still stable. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan were all similar.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday morning, the weather was still cloudy, and 22-23 ships arrived from the river. Market trading was average. The price of medium-grade white 〇〇 was tight in the morning session, and the afternoon session closed with a light stomach and a firm shape. Early-season Dao was scarce, and the price increased by about 1 cent. Bo Dao sold weakly, with a stable shape. Yang Du Bu Jian rose by a few cents, and Yin Bian Yuan rose by 7-8 cents. Ke Jian sales were flat, and the price was stable. There were no transactions in the other rice.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke 〇〇 market saw arrivals from Jiujiang, Hankou, Jiangbei, Wenzhou, and Taiwan. However, because more and more places of origin have banned exports, the arrivals were no longer as active as in the past. The cost was also high. Merchants still hoped for a good market. However, because merchants have been shipping out whole lots of Ke 〇〇 for days, it is difficult for them to continue to speculate. There were only sporadic small buyers, and merchants completely stopped, leaving only the local market to handle the business. The market price continued to rise. However, yesterday's arrivals and sales were balanced, sentiment was firm, and the market price lacked any change. Throughout the day, 5,800 bags of Gan rice, 1,147 bags of Wenzhou Taiwan rice, 1,000 bags of Jiangbei rice, 100 bags of Jing 〇〇, 113 bags of Wu Yuan, and 300 bags of Siam rice were all sold and delivered by this shop.</p>

<p>Although the oil and soybean cake market lacked large-scale outlets, because the 穗 〇〇 Bang oil factory alone bought more than 100 carts of soybeans in the exchange, the market's turnover was inevitably scarce, and sentiment was tighter. The oil cake was driven by soaring raw materials, and the market was thriving. Yesterday, the market for Eastern Province soybeans was stable with arrivals. The prices of the remaining soy beans rose by 0.4 to 1 cents. More than 5,000 bags of soybeans were traded. The price of Dou oil compared to the previous market session continued to rise by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Peanut oil was temporarily stable. The soybean cake exchange was small, but the trend was strong, and the price continued to tighten by 0.2 to 0.3 cents.</p>

<p>The supply of ten-grade sea cucumber has been decreasing in recent years, and the market has been hoarding due to the shortage of goods, so the value has been rising. The number of sales to various customers has also decreased sharply due to high sales prices. The current inventory on the street is less than 50 boxes (about 150 catties per box), which only accounts for 20-30% of the past. If Sichuan and Hubei merchants engage in buying, there is a risk of insufficient demand. When the store opened for sales yesterday, 35-piece Zeng Mao goods were priced at 270 yuan, 60-piece goods were priced at 258 yuan, and 45-piece Nemuro goods were priced at 283 yuan. A total of 11 boxes were sold very well and were distributed by the merchants.</p>
<p>The supply of eight-legged sea cucumber is also scarce at the moment. When the goods were opened, eight boxes were opened, with 32-piece goods priced at 212 yuan and 40-piece goods priced at 195.5 yuan. The market situation is also very tight.</p>

<p>Tunxi is a tea distribution center in Xiaonan. The annual production and sales of foreign tea from this place reaches more than 100,000 boxes. Since the Hangzhou-Huizhou highway has been unblocked, the tea industry in Tunxi has become more prosperous. As the Qingming Festival is approaching, new tea is about to be launched on the market. Recently, tea houses have been established one after another, like bamboo shoots after rain. There are already 58 tea houses that have officially announced their establishment. The lively situation is the same as in the past. Shanghai tea warehouses have also sent staff to gather there to engage in negotiations and lending, which is very busy. Generally, tea farmers are quite content with this arrangement.</p>

<p>Southern Tang Qian Shi (Gorgon Fruit) has been sluggish recently due to poor sales, and the market is continuing to decline. The selling prices of the stores are also inconsistent. Some are asking 60 yuan, while others are asking 58 yuan. There are only sporadic sales, which proves that the market is still difficult to stabilize. The price of Chi Qian also fell by a small 1-2 yuan. Good-quality Ti Jing goods were sold for 18 yuan, and ordinary goods were reduced accordingly. The market needs to see a rebound in sales before there is hope of a recovery.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wool fabric trade was strong, and the Public Welfare Association market was bustling. There were also large transactions of spring goods such as Chinese and Western suits and pullover tops in this street and small merchants. This spring has a leap month of March, which is what the custom calls "leap month extends," and the weather turns hot later, extending spring sales. Therefore, interlining fabrics such as horse-riding pants, herringbone cloth, slightly thicker 〇〇 〇司 〇〇 and flower wool fabrics have all seen extended sales. 〇〇, medium-thick serge, Yuanchang yellow-gray 〇〇 fabrics have all sold more than in the past.</p>

<p>The business of garden galvanized iron wire in Fujian was exclusively strong yesterday, reaching 350 dan. New Xing, Lin Zaiji, and other stores also added more to their orders.

<p>Recently, the demand for blue galvanized iron has been strong from thermos bottle factories, cigarette factories, and tool factories. There were not enough goods in the market to distribute, and the market price was estimated at 31 yuan per box, which was 1 yuan better than before. It is said that merchants and can factories have also been buying a lot recently.</p>

<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>On the second afternoon of my arrival in Penang, I found an old friend, Zhang Hui, at a Chinese newspaper office. The first thing he said to me was:</p>
<p>"Hu Wenbo, a teacher in Bukit Mertajam, is dead!"</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"He was crushed to death by real life!" he said coldly. "Tomorrow, you should go to the funeral too! I'm done with my work now and I'm going to the widow's house. You'll know everything tomorrow."</p>
<p>I walked aimlessly down the grey streets of Penang. Over the years, the shadows of young friends had disappeared one by one around me; my heart was filled with sadness and fear.</p>
<p>〇〇 died; Hu Wenbo also died! The weak died; the brave also died. The world is one, yet the ways people die are ever-changing. Death begets the future; yet it also buries the past. How did our Hu Wenbo die?"</p>
<p>I spent the entire afternoon thinking about this. I tried my best to search my memory for stories. I thought about how Hu Wenbo had graduated from a university in northern China, how he had rolled around in the waves of southern China; and how he had deserted, burying his youthful vitality in the southern wilderness; and now, Hu Wenbo was dead! Did he kill himself, or did society kill him?</p>
<p>Let the facts show me!</p>
<p>The next morning at eight o'clock, I went to the pier. A crowd was stirring on the pier. There were reporters from the Chinese newspaper, teachers from Chinese schools, fellow townsmen "towkays," and young students.</p>
<p>A small motorboat was sailing over from the other side. The placid strait was churning up spray. The strait sparkled with gold in the bright sun, while the sorrowful crowd wore grey faces in the scorching sun.</p>
<p>As the motorboat reached the shore, mournful music began to play. The procession was immersed in silent grief, and the leaves on the shore rustled in the breeze.</p>
<p>A black coffin was carried ashore by workers. Behind it, a young widow wearing mourning clothes wept with her head bowed, and two children aged six or seven tugged at their mother's skirt, crying along with her.</p>
<p>Then 〇〇〇 came out of the motorboat. He waved his hand, directing the procession forward.</p>
<p>At the very front was a banner with black characters written on white cloth: "Sending Mr. Hu Wenbo's Soul to Rest." Next was a hired Indian band. Following was the coffin. Then the deceased's young wife, and two young children. Closely following was a team of children wearing white uniforms, divided into three large cars. Finally, were the deceased's fellow townsmen, and friends attending the funeral.</p>
<p>I was sandwiched in the middle of the procession. The heat was steaming my brain. The procession passed by in silence. Only the sound of the cars running over the street, and the weeping of the widow and orphans, occasionally carried by the breeze. The Indian band was listlessly playing mournful music lacking rhythm, and the grey forests of Penang Island occasionally flew past the corner of our eyes.</p>
<p>Close behind the deceased and the widow's carriage, the hooves of the horses in our carriage also rang out on the street, more suited than the Indian music to express the rhythms of human grief.</p>
<p>Wei Jiang sat on my left. At first, he remained silent, but once the conversation started, words flowed smoothly under his calm face:</p>
<p>"Hu Wenbo, a cowardly bug! A useless intellectual. Fire flashed before his eyes, and he jumped up; darkness fell before his eyes, and he retreated. He had knowledge and passion, but lacked will. You see him jumping here and there, embracing the so-called 'conscience' and running around, but in the end, the intellectual's conscience died along with his body and passion!</p>
<p>"He retreated from the motherland, dragging his wife, and eventually his children, serving as a teacher, a reporter, a translator for mines and rubber plantations, and also as a clerk in companies. Oppressed by life, he abandoned his career as a teacher and reporter to become a translator or clerk for big 'towkays', but when his 'conscience' couldn't stand the blatant facts before him, he returned to being a primary school teacher. He traveled between British and Dutch possessions, hitting a wall everywhere for himself or for others, and finally his strong body was worn down, and his soul was wounded."</p>
<p>Wei Jiang paused for a moment, adding:</p>
<p>"Ah, what a clean soul!"</p>
<p>Then he said:</p>
<p>"Friends couldn't bear to see him like that, and often encouraged him:</p>
<p>"'Ah, Wenbo, lift up your head! Turn your eyes to the sun!'</p>
<p>"But it was no use. His head drooped even lower, and his eyes became gloomy and suppressed. He said:</p>
<p>"'I feel like I'm old! I'm already useless!'</p>
<p>"I said:</p>
<p>"'Hu Wenbo is already dead! He is beyond salvation!'</p>
<p>"What do you think he said? He admitted:</p>
<p>"'Yes. I'm dead! I think I've already turned into a grey animal; and this grey animal is about to perish!'</p>
<p>"Sure enough, after that, he blamed himself and cursed himself every day, hoping to end his life quickly. He became despondent, and he destroyed himself in various ways. His purpose has been achieved today."</p>
<p>Wei Jiang's words gradually became agitated, but he restrained himself, and he calmly continued the story:</p>
<p>"Finally, he got sick. He coughed up mouthfuls of blood. Ruo Ping (today's widow) advised him to go to the hospital. He said:</p>
<p>"'What money do I have to go to the hospital?'</p>
<p>"But when death came before his eyes, he was afraid of dying again. So, the fellow townsmen 'towkays' sent him to the hospital. They said:</p>
<p>"'It's so pitiful, this young man.'</p>
<p>"So I admit that he committed suicide, and 〇〇〇〇 〇〇."</p>
<p>As the procession stopped, the sun did not shine on the dead in the overseas Chinese cemetery.</p>
<p>A tomb had already been dug, and after the coffin was lowered, a pile of flowers ended the fate of a certain type of intellectual in this century. The widow's wailing could not call back the grief of the soul, and the condolences of friends could not save the life of a coward.</p>
<p>The procession on the way back seemed more lively: the living rejoiced that they had not yet perished; the "towkays" praised the dead; the widow and orphans cried about the gloomy future; some of the young students wiped their noses and tears, while others were lively and immediately laughing. The Indian band was scattered like defeated soldiers, and the streets of Penang still seemed coldly lifeless under the hot sun. But Zhang Jiang said angrily:</p>
<p>"Soul suicide is an unforgivable sin in this century. The meaning of our funeral is only to bury the past, not to enlighten the future."</p>
<p>The next day, in the HuaWen newspaper obituary that Wei Jiang edited, the subtitle of his memorial article was:</p>
<p>"Helping orphans is welcoming the future era; mourning the dead is sending away the decaying present!"</p>
<p>Then I understood the meaning of Wei Jiang's cold face, even though his article had aroused some antipathy among the overseas Chinese friends.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Preface to "Common Collection" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>This small collection contains some essays I wrote during the so-called "Year of Essayettes." With very few exceptions, they were written from the autumn of 1933 to the summer of 1934. Because of the popularity of literary supplements, essayettes naturally flourished. Although I had never intended to write this type of thing amidst this uniquely Chinese phenomenon, I somehow followed the trend and wrote some short articles of this nature.</p>
<p>Writing month after month, I never really counted how many I had written; I kept the manuscripts, but I never thought about publishing them as a collection. Although some people asked me if I wanted to publish these short articles, firstly, the quantity was small, and secondly, I always felt that these essays were more trouble than they were worth. Therefore, the result was always a refusal.</p>
<p>Originally, these things were destined to disappear. However, they followed me on my travels, to "summer resorts," to "villas," and then, in my luggage, they came back with me, and they became the beloved infants I cherished. I treasured them, and then I felt that they were my past life.</p>
<p>Friends advised me to collect them, so I selected some, discarded a portion, and compiled about seven or eight tenths of the total quantity into this collection. As a result, the quantity was surprisingly large, and I myself was surprised.</p>
<p>After the compilation was completed, the problem of naming it arose. After several days of work, I finally settled on the two characters "Common" (平凡). Because the two characters "Common" suited my state of mind at the time and were most representative of the characteristics of these miscellaneous essays, I named it "Common Collection" (平凡集). When I mentioned the word "Collection" (集), I always felt like it sounded old-fashioned. But, just using the two characters "Common" (平凡) felt a bit insufficient, and so, I compromised.</p>
<p>Over the years, my state of mind has gradually become common. It is not surprising that a child born of the earth wants to align their life with the pace of the earth. Demons do not fall from angels, but are sons of the earth, and I have thought this way every year. On my long journey through life, I once longed for the distant horizon, where human habitation ends. However, this past feeling is now a cloud of smoke in my memory. Because, I am becoming more common day by day, I love the mundane world, I love the commonness of humanity. The sons of the earth must be in step with the earth's commonness.</p>
<p>Living on the earth, every day should be spent working: whether it is going to battle, building bridges, or paving roads, anything is fine, as long as it benefits the people on earth. Perhaps the miscellaneous essays in "Common Collection" were written with a little bit of a patching-up purpose. However, they are common and not extraordinary. In this kind of common work, I have offended people, but I have also met some new friends. "Chopping is not as round as shaving" (砍的不如削的圓). Those who like to pick on you will always have their say. These miscellaneous essays are some patching-up work. Naturally, one cannot start from ABC, provide a lengthy introduction, and omissions and grammatical errors are inevitable. Misunderstandings are common; but, assuming that those who attacked me in the past did not have ulterior motives, let their attacks become "past." Unmalicious attacks should be forgotten.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, during that year of writing these miscellaneous essays, I also met some new friends; one of them is unforgettable, and that is Mr. Chen Junzhi. But that young man from Yangzhou died of a terrible disease, and he died in a foreign land! Ever since becoming friends after a decisive debate, he often advised me to write more miscellaneous essays and later collect them into a collection, adding the texts of those who opposed me in the debate: I have always remembered this advice. There was once a debate about movies, but because that was not my own field, I didn't even want my own articles, let alone include the other party's articles. However, the debate with Junzhi was handled according to Junzhi's wishes. Whether I was right in the debate itself and whether there was a conclusion is another matter. However, what is expressed here is not hostility, but rather a kind of friendship.</p>
<p>This collection is not poetry, but essays. However, it reveals my emotions everywhere. Naturally, those are common emotions. Although it contains some of my own feelings, it is definitely not a proper notebook-style essay. Calling it miscellaneous essays is fine, but calling it a notebook-style essay is a bit inappropriate. During this year, I did write ten kinds of aesthetically pleasing impressionistic essays like "Autumn Landscape Painting," a total of four articles, and some nostalgic essays, but I always felt that they were either too affected or too artificial, or the emotions were monotonous and stiff. These kinds of miscellaneous essays are more natural. When writing this type of miscellaneous essay, my state of mind is always common, and my attitude is always serious! This kind of commonness is perhaps nothing more than the commonness of birth.</p>
<p>My state of mind is common. Therefore, the collection is named "Common Collection" (平凡集). I hope that I can make my state of mind even more common.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Spring City Where Flowers Fly Everywhere <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<h3 id="e206">Yellow Wind <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>My home is on the coast of the East Sea, enjoying the moistening effect of the marine air currents. Even in the slightly dry spring, I don't feel the threat of the wind. In March, the spring rain seems to be urging the flowers to bloom. If there is wind, it should be "the willow wind that brushes the face without causing coldness."</p>
<p>Since coming to this ancient city, I have come to know the yellow wind.</p>
<p>In this part of northern Shandong, there are no mountains. One can sweep the horizon for a thousand miles. There are no barriers between it and northern China, so it is suitable for the wind to come and go as if entering an uninhibited place.</p>
<p>People encircled in this ancient city cannot easily distinguish the boundaries of the seasons, because still within its embrace are clumps of weeds like yellow flowers, next to broken bricks and tiles mixed with white bones, and then stretches of open land, with a few families scattered on the edges of the land. The circle of the ancient city does not let the spring colors in. The trees are sparse. Spring here never seems like spring.</p>
<p>However, if you want to know the news of spring, it is not difficult. Just use the yellow wind as a marker. There is no ambiguity at all. The yellow wind seems to have an inextricable bond with spring. It will never forget her. It is afraid that youth cannot bear the loneliness.</p>
<p>Last year, because of the drought, the yellow wind was particularly severe. It has such great power that just thinking about it immediately makes people think of the instability of the universe! Its arrival is not fixed at any time, during the day, or perhaps in the night. You are sleeping soundly, and suddenly someone is shaking the doors and windows violently. You wake up abruptly, your heart pounding. At this time, the outside sounds like waves rising on the sea, like countless spirits roaring. When you realize what the sound is, you feel a bit suffocated in your nostrils. Clench your teeth, and there is a rustling sound. Close your eyes and you can't sleep anymore. A kind of terror engulfs your heart, as if you are in a dangerous atmosphere, afraid to think about the sun in the morning.</p>
<p>Opening your eyes in the morning, the small house has become another world. You are no longer the master. The tablecloth, window sill, books... are all sealed with dust. Opening the door, the wind and dust choke you back. It is raining outside. A rain of dust. The windows and doors shake pitifully like madmen. Fine sand finds a little gap and desperately drills into the house. I don't know where the sun has been blown. You can't see the sky, you can't see the ground, the universe has become a sea of soil! People and everything rise and fall in its waves, trying hard to root their feet in the ground. If you relax, you worry that a hand will grab you away. The branches are like ten thousand mosquitos struggling to fly into the sky, and it seems like something is tripping you under your feet, listening to its angry roar!</p>
<p>Lying on the bed with my eyes closed, I think of the quiet scenery of spring in my hometown to calm my swaying heart. "Wham," a clod of mud the size of a fist falls near my ear. I jump up suddenly, push open the door forcefully, and call the swirling current to rush into Shen Ting's house, because I am too worried about her sick body.</p>
<p>She is coughing in the house with a sad face. As soon as she sees me, she complains: "I told you not to be in this place"! After she finishes speaking, she coughs again, spitting out something red. I hug her and go to the training office to take refuge, because that room has double-layer glass windows.</p>
<p>The people seeking refuge are already full. Everyone has a handkerchief in their mouth, and apricot yellow is dotted on their hair and eyebrows. Putting her on a recliner, covering her face with a handkerchief, we look at each other, no one says a word. What can be used to compare this desolate taste?</p>
<p>Once, the red outside the glass window looked like it was on fire, with a buzzing sound. Once, it was all black, with no houses, no people, no shadows, no universe.</p>
<p>The sand dunes of northern China are uprooting and heading south. Every life has the terror of the end of the world. Looking at Shen Ting's appearance, I resentfully think: "Who told you to be attached to this sandy land without spring"?</p>
<p>Like an angry person gradually calming down, the wind becomes so small that it makes people think that the universe is worth cherishing. The window also turns white. This group of refugees removes their masks, removes the terror from their faces, pats their bodies, and pushes open the door of the house. At this time, the ground outside is like a white mirror in high places, and a pile of weeds and a pile of white sand in low places. A gentle breeze is still teasing them to spin around.</p>
<p>Everyone returns to their own house to sweep away three inches of dust and temporarily become the master again. But who dares to say that tomorrow will not come again?</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Night is Not Yet Over <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<h3 id="e208">In the Alley <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Living in an alley, the days are extremely lonely. Usually, I have no other way to pass the time except reading.</p>
<p>A life of seclusion gradually makes a person's energy tend towards boredom. In poverty and embarrassment, all hope turns dark before my eyes.</p>
<p>In a deathly silent environment, life is easy to decline; like a piece of iron that easily rusts in damp air.</p>
<p>The weather has changed several times. However, I am still living in the alley with a dark mood, without any hope.</p>
<p>Sitting by the window, listening to the sound of reading from the neighbor's private school; the calls of vendors from the alley; the sounds of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law scolding each other in nearby houses; and the rogue vagrants walking along the alley, straightening their throats and humming Peking opera. All of this causes me unreasonable discomfort. At noon and in the afternoon, the alley seems a little more lively. Elementary school students from nearby elementary schools come and go in the alley, and in the chaotic footsteps, two or three elementary school students sing songs. I can also hear the vigorous sound of the elementary school teacher's leather shoes hitting the alley.</p>
<p>One day passes, always silent tea and meals, a somber mood: foolishly lost in thought.</p>
<p>At dusk, the alley becomes quiet, leaving only the gasping coughs of old passersby. In front of the window, I look at the gray twilight clouds filled with coldness, and flocks of crows cawing and forming a black battle formation, then circling in the sky for exercises.</p>
<p>I am tired, how can I live like this forever; a low sigh scatters in the wind.</p>
<p>In a state of hopelessness and without comfort, the greatness and true meaning of life will gradually become blurred and dim in one's heart.</p>
<p>Under the light, accompanied by my elderly grandmother, I just think blankly about a life without any reliance; I begin to experience a kind of unbearable feeling of not being able to cry; the sadness of being rejected by the world, like thousands of sharp needles, piercing my painful heart.</p>
<p>I hope there will be a good dream at night, but in the dream, I am still walking in a dark alley, with a depressing gray rainy sky... Reading and writing are just a bleak way for a loser to pass the time!</p>
<p>I don't know when I will cheer up, move, and leave the life in the alley.</p>
<h3 id="e209">"Skill" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Lu Ji's "Rhyme Prose on Literature" (文賦) spoke of many experiences regarding the benefits and drawbacks of writing, and then suddenly shifted to say: "As for the abundant composition and flowing expression, adapting to circumstances and subtly expressing emotions... It is like a dancer responding to the rhythm by throwing their sleeves, and a singer responding to the strings with their voice. This is something a wheelwright cannot express, and thus cannot be fully explained by flowery words." This is also his experience. He always felt that literary creation has such a realm of "skill" that can be understood intuitively but not expressed in words. The pre-Qin philosophers talked a lot about this subtle and complex realm of "skill." Mencius and his disciples mentioned the word "skill" twice when discussing learning. One place said: "Wisdom is like skill; sagacity is like strength. It is like shooting at a target a hundred steps away; reaching the target is your strength, but hitting the target is not your strength." Another place said: "Carpenters and wheelwrights can give people rules, but they cannot make people skillful." Other stories, such as Zhuangzi's Cook Ding dismembering an ox, Wheelwright Bian's new wheels, and Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals' Yi Zhi discussing tripods, also explain this principle. (The Heavenly Ways chapter: "Wheelwright Bian said to Duke Huan, 'Judging from my craft, making wheels, if the chisel is too slow, it's loose and not strong; if it's too fast, it's rough and doesn't fit; neither slow nor fast, it's mastered by the hand and responds to the heart, it cannot be spoken, there's a principle in between, I cannot teach my son, my son cannot learn from me, so I'm seventy years old and still making wheels.'") Generally speaking, discussing literature and the Dao, reaching the deepest realm, these words can mutually illuminate and confirm each other. Mr. Yu Pingbo once expressed this idea and wrote an article about the wandering and solitude of literature. The passage in the preface to "Six Records of a Floating Life" (浮生六記) says it well:</p>
<p>"There is a common rule for the perfection of literary and career achievements, which is 'Seeking it will not necessarily get it, not seeking it may come naturally.' The most wonderful thing is to learn from the flowing water, the most wonderful thing is to learn from the spring birds and autumn insects. It is certainly not intentional, but it is not necessarily unintentional... When we encounter all external things, we should not be deliberate, deliberation leads to stagnation; we should not sever connections, severance leads to separation."</p>
<p>I don't want to repeat the opinions of my predecessors and explain the word "skill" in another roundabout way. What I am asking is, since it is so ingenious and subtle, that it cannot be spoken, as they say; then why do they keep talking and talking, never ceasing? I think their purpose is still to "obtain the transmission," but they are afraid that it is "impossible to transmit," so they try to find a path to "what can be spoken" from "what cannot be spoken." Therefore, they use "the wonderful cannot be spoken" to explain "the wonderful." In this regard, I think there are roughly three layers of meaning that can be said.</p>
<p>First, they (whether discussing metaphysics or art criticism) see that the root cause of most people's problems lies in being trapped in the barrier of words and unable to get out. Originally, it was "people" using "words," but the result is that "words" dominate "people." Therefore, a sharp rebuke is necessary, as Zhuangzi said: "What the world values in the Dao is books; books are nothing but words, and words have what is valued in them. What is valued in words is the meaning, and the meaning follows something. What the meaning follows cannot be transmitted in words. But the world values the transmission of words and books, even if the world values them, they are not worthy of being valued, because they value what is not worth valuing. Therefore, what can be seen is form and color, what can be heard is name and sound. Alas! People think that form, color, name, and sound are enough to obtain their feelings; but form, color, name, and sound are not enough to obtain their feelings, then the wise do not speak, and those who speak do not know. How can the world understand this!" (Guo Xiang's commentary clarifies this meaning, saying: "The words and meaning have something, and what the words and meaning refer to has nothing; therefore, seek it outside of the words and meaning, enter the realm of no words and no meaning, and then arrive.") We use language and words as tools to express emotions and ideas, but Zhuangzi tells us to seek it outside of the words and meaning. This has a very deep meaning; in modern terms, it is what Angellier said: "The words in poetry are only like stepping stones lying across a stream, we can walk over the stream on them. But if you just linger on them and don't move, your feet will inevitably get wet; you must hurry across!" Breaking the barrier of words is the only way to avoid the constraints of words; knowing that "skill" is within and outside of language and words is the only way to understand where "skill" lies. Mr. Zhang Taiyan said of his own learning, "Starting with analyzing concepts and ending with discarding concepts." It can also be used to discuss literature.</p>
<p>Second, the subtle realm of "skill" is originally "dim and vague," but this realm does not exist in a void, but in our experience. Although we cannot directly point to this realm with language and words, we can use other methods to guide everyone into this realm. Lu Ji's "Rhyme Prose on Literature" says about our creative imagination: "Floating in the abyss to drift with the current, washing the lower springs and secretly immersing; thus, submerging words that are displeasing, as if a fish is hooked and comes out, measuring the depth of the abyss, floating algae linked together, as if a soaring bird is shot down and falls from the high clouds." He thought that finding a suitable adjective or adverb, arranging a suitable set of words, was the same as shooting birds in the air or fishing in the abyss, not too early, not too late, finding it at the right time and place, this is called "skill." Mr. Zhou Zuoren talked about wine and said, "The method and tools for making wine seem simple, but the technique of cooking is extremely difficult; usually families who make wine hire a person, commonly called 'wine head worker,' to be in charge of identifying the timing of cooking the wine. It is said that this is not difficult, just go to the vat and bend down to listen, and hear the sound of bubbles inside, murmuring, like crabs spitting foam, then take it out to cook; a little early, the wine is not yet made, a little late, it turns sour. But how to determine the exact timing, others still cannot know, only experienced ears can determine, just like the eyes of antique experts distinguish antiquities." This can also be borrowed as an explanation of "skill." The meaning of "skill" exists universally. Being able to understand other "skills" also means understanding "skill" in creation; not appealing to metaphysics, but appealing to everyone's experience, this is the second layer.</p>
<p>Third, as the saying goes, "Practice makes perfect." Yang Xiong replied to Huan Tan's discussion of writing rhyme prose, saying: "Practice subdues the multitude of spirits, skill is nothing more than the gate of practice." The famous general Han Qi always hit the target with every shot, and an old oil vendor beside him ridiculed, saying: "It's just that your hand is hot." It can be seen that "skill" is not unobtainable, much practice can make you understand and do it. Koizumi Yakumo said: "When emotion comes, what happens? This is a moment of surprise, fear, pain, or pleasure, the prickling sensation, coming without a trace, going without a trace... No one can write this feeling on paper immediately, just as they received it. This can only be achieved through hard work... This process is very similar to focusing a telescope. Before a distant object can be clearly seen, the lens barrel must be rotated in a little, rotated out a little, then rotated in a little, rotated out a little, such extension and shortening, repeated adjustment. Yes, writers must use language like tourists use telescopes. This is the first necessary condition for any literary work." Literary "skill" cannot be obtained by departing from rules; carpenters and wheelwrights give people rules, which is the initial step to giving people skill. Xu Yinfang's postscript to Sikong Tu's "Discourse on Poetry with Li Sheng" says: "Biao Sheng discusses the flavor of poetry being outside of sour and salty, and then uses Youcheng's Suzhou as a standard, this is the high standard of poets, those who do not learn it well will easily fall into empty patterns. Among the Tang people, the four families of Wang, Meng, Wei, and Liu have similar poetic styles, and their poems are all obtained from hard work. People only see their clarity, elegance, and exquisiteness, but do not know that they have been washed and refined many times before achieving clarity, and refined through many tempering before achieving exquisiteness. If scholars seek it from the appearance of clarity and exquisiteness, they will inevitably imitate their tone and copy their words, and none will not fall into empty patterns." This is very well said. Clarity and exquisiteness come from tempering and refining, obtaining sagacity from foolishness, and obtaining skill from clumsiness, and then "thinking is more than half done."</p>
<p>Zhuangzi's "Achieving Life" chapter says, "Confucius went to Chu and came out of the forest, and saw a hunchback catching cicadas, as if picking them up. Confucius said, 'Are you skillful? Do you have a way?' He said, 'I have a way, in the fifth and sixth months, I stack the balls of clay to put on the end of the stick to catch the cicadas. If I miss, it is just the weight of a small silver coin. If I stack three and don't miss, then I miss once in ten. If I stack five and don't miss, I pick them up. I stand like a tree trunk, and I hold my arm like a dry branch, although the heaven and earth are big, and there are many things, I only know the cicada's wing. I don't turn or lean, I don't exchange the cicada's wing for anything, why can't I get it!' Confucius turned to his disciples and said, 'Using the will without distraction, then it is concentrated in the spirit, is this not what the hunchback elder says?'" I use this story as the ending to explain skill; truly, there is no other way to treat the aphid but to catch it diligently.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Mother Education Competition <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Education Hall on Hua Long Road in the French Concession, in order to promote the sense of responsibility of mothers in the family and create a social atmosphere that values virtuous mothers, specifically held a Mother Education Competition on Children's Day, April 4th. Participating children must be accompanied by their mothers. The competition items are divided into physique, cleanliness, etiquette, and communication, etc.</p>
<p>I think this work is very important, but it is also very wasteful. How do I say this? It makes me think of a film from Lianhua Film Company in the past called "Little Angel." The film depicted two families, one family with a very good "virtuous mother atmosphere," and the other the opposite, where the mother gambled all day, so that the child's "cleanliness," "etiquette," etc., were not as good as the child raised under the "virtuous mother education." So, if the Women's Education Hall can promote "mother education" among this group of women, it might not be a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, this is a wasteful thing! Why? First, are women only supposed to give birth to children and spend their whole lives working on their children's "physique," "cleanliness," "etiquette," and "communication," etc.? Although these things should not be said to be the responsibility of mothers, aren't they also the responsibility of fathers? To put it more broadly, creating a good child is not only the great responsibility of mothers and fathers, but also the even greater responsibility of society. Even if you as parents devote all your energy to educating children, the education of the social environment will later turn your energy into nothing. Second: Mothers themselves are also a problem. Apart from those ladies who want to create a "virtuous mother atmosphere," we see countless broad, hardworking women whose own "cleanliness" and "physique," etc., are still a problem, so how can they take care of their children's "physique" and "etiquette"?</p>
<p>Because of these two points, I think this is a wasteful move. However, among those ladies with a "virtuous mother atmosphere," it is a more worthwhile "big event"!</p>

<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>Even in winter, the children in the countryside wake up with the dawn. And since country folk don’t consider children's play a serious matter, every day in the freezing morning, a group of children would come knocking on the school door. At this time, I would put on my clothes and pull open the bolt for them, letting that group of children with their heads buried in fur hats run into the dark classroom. Then, a burnt smell of poorly burnt wood and the scent of burnt chaff would seep into my bedroom. Because the winter in the north is extremely cold, and a classroom left empty overnight is more freezing than an ordinary house, and the school doesn't have the funds for a stove, each of them would hold a gray fire pot, filled with broken charcoal? Or something like chaff, placing it on their desks. Thus, the three small classrooms would maintain a bit of pitiful warmth amidst an not-so-pleasant smell. The classroom and the teacher's room are connected, with the door opening in the wall between them, making it seem like a suite of the classroom. So, as the grayish-white little fire pots were brought into the classroom one by one, I also smelled the unique scent of rural homes in winter.</p>
<p>At this time, I would leave the heated brick bed that took up half of the small room and sit at a large square table in front of the window, waiting for the old man who was both the night watchman and the school handyman to bring me water to wash my face. Outside, the children in the classroom would read their books aloud.</p>
<p>After the washing water was brought, the old man would pour a pot of boiling water into a round, big-bellied red clay teapot and put firewood burned while boiling water into a gray fire pot, bringing it to my room. After all of this was done, after a while, I would need to check the time, pick up the bell and ring it twice in my room, then put down the bell, pick up the roll book, textbooks, and chalk box, and run to the small platform.</p>
<p>The classroom was narrow and long, with only three windows with rustling paper stretched over them, set into the front wall. The room seemed a bit damp. In the center, there were several rows of crude, unfinished white wooden desks and benches. In this dim and rough environment, there sat twenty-six or twenty-seven rural wild children who were quite a match for the classroom. The characteristic of these children was that they constantly had two streams of snot running down their noses, frequently wiping them with their sleeves that had become shiny. Even more were "slapping" along in two pairs of worn straw shoes with broken heels, bravely running in the ankle-deep snowy fields on snowy days. The only two girls still had bound feet, dragging along and walking with a twist in their small braids. The teaching method was naturally multi-grade, dividing the twenty-six or twenty-seven children into fragmented small groups, and the teacher’s focus was also divided into fragments. While teaching, there would often be coughing old men, holding dry tobacco pipes, coming in to watch the fun, sometimes even helping the teacher loudly discipline their own children. At such times, I could only force a bitter smile or try to smooth things over because the old men were all people of status in the village and were not allowed to be openly interfered with.</p>
<p>When the winter sun was close to the ground, it was often the time when the last review was finished. Then, the silent village would suddenly become lively, filled with the shouts of children. I would let out a sigh and collapse onto the earthen bed, along with my fatigue. Soon, in the quiet courtyard, a familiar sound of footsteps could be heard. In the small room filled with shadows, the man holding the meal would appear. The meal was contracted to a farmer's family for five silver dollars, taken from the seventeen silver dollar salary. We often ate millet pancakes or black bread, small tofu, very thick porridge, and a small dish of stir-fried vegetables especially for the "teacher."</p>
<p>After eating, the old man who was both the night watchman and the school handyman would again bring a basket of grass to burn for my heated brick bed. After it was burned and the whole room was filled with smoke, he would cough and take the empty basket away. Looking at his limping back as he walked away, it often made people feel an indescribable loneliness. Only this little bit of time belonged to me, but it was often taken away, because who knows when an old man with a long pipe would stride in to chat, or a stranger would come in, holding two red paper strips, wanting me to read their "eight characters," or clutching a yellow paper, wanting me to write a "document" for them. When I told them with a bitter smile that I couldn't do this kind of work, they would often stare with a pair of confused eyes, the meaning probably being: How can a teacher not do such a small thing? Or they would ramble on with me, saying that the previous teachers all wrote them.</p>
<p>Knowing that a few words of explanation would be useless, I could only send them away with a bitter smile. Watching their clumsy shadows disappear into the darkness, I would be confused and think about their sons, thinking about how to teach their sons.</p>

<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>— Recollections of Beiping</p>
<p>Late at night, I followed a friend out of Qianmen, winding through narrow alleys, walking from this hutong to that hutong, my feet stepping on the uneven cobblestone road. A dark hutong unfolded before me.</p>
<p>Stepping into another large hutong, it was much brighter. Each door had a glowing electric light, red and green ribbons, lined with glass frames, with many names on them. Pieces of red characters seemed to dance before my eyes.</p>
<p>I followed, walking in the Eight Great Hutongs. I felt like I was walking in circles in a maze. From this hutong, turning to that hutong, there were only lanterns and rows of open black-lacquered red-lettered gates.</p>
<p>Going in through this doorframe, and then coming out of this doorframe, I followed, stepping into the first-class brothels, then to the second-class teahouses, I followed, dizzy.</p>
<p>Every time I walked into an open door, into a room with a lot of furniture, a plump mama-san, like a judge, stood like a wooden bucket, loudly calling out the charming names of the girls, names just like those in ancient Chinese legends, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Moon, Round, Flower, Fragrant, Beautiful, Gorgeous...</p>
<p>One by one, the girls stepped into the threshold, turned around and came back, each bringing a burst of powdery scent, one after another, long, round, different faces, floated before me.</p>
<p>Again, stepping into a door of another house, into a narrow room, the furniture inside became dilapidated and crude, the room was so old, I felt a little strange.</p>
<p>In the loud shouting of the mama-san, one by one the girls came out, one after another, I was startled, drowsily as if waking up from a dream.</p>
<p>The white face painted with water powder like a white wall *blank space* different color, tall</p>

<p>Krogstad: I came home and saw the note you left. What is this all about?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: We must talk.</p>
<p>Krogstad: Is there anything left for us to talk about? Since you left me, it's as if the ground I stood on has sunk. Look at me now, I've become like a shipwrecked person grabbing onto a broken plank.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: I am also a shipwrecked person grabbing onto a broken plank. Neither remembering nor caring for anyone. Krogstad, what if we two shipwrecked people support each other, what do you think?</p>
<p>Krogstad: Do you really mean it? Do you know all the bad things I've done in the past?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: You seemed to say earlier that if you had me back then, you would never have ended up in this state.</p>
<p>Krogstad: You naturally don't know the means I used to deal with the Helmer couple?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: I know everything.</p>
<p>Krogstad: I wish I could undo this. I will wait for Helmer to return here,</p>
<p>And ask him to return the letter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: No, Helmer should know about this secret loan. The two of them should be completely honest with each other. This hesitant approach will never lead to a day of openness.</p>
<p>Krogstad: Alright. But if I can help, I will do it immediately. I will wait for you across the street and send you home.</p>

<p>high hair, thin body, under the light one by one dragged their bodies in, and then dragged their bodies out, I felt exceptionally frightened.</p>
<p>Walking back, I realized that this was a third-class "boarding house." Knowing that the girls inside would suffer the trampling of several or even a dozen people in one day, my heart trembled faintly.</p>
<p>The night grew deeper, and only the lights of the late-night food stalls in the hutong still flickered yellowishly towards us.</p>
<p>I followed, stepping back into a dark narrow alley.</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Jia Baoyu Also Talks About Xiaoxiang Pavilion"</p>
<p>Severe winter frost forms into ice. The moonlight is hazy and about to break the soul. A gust of north wind penetrates the bones. The Black, cavernous Grand View Garden is cold and desolate. Baoyu is walking all the way on Flower Street. The night is late and quiet, with no sound. He is a lamp. Alone. Dark shadows advancing forward. All alone he comes to Xiaoxiang Pavilion. To see if the illness of sister Lin has lessened. Gently knocks the copper ring with a dripping sound. Is there anyone who will quickly open the door? Zixuan listens. Asks: Is Second Master wishing to come inside? She busily opens the door. Please be careful of the cold of the deep night, have no mercy. Thank you sister for being so considerate. I will never forget your great kindness. Only for being worried about your Miss Lin. That is why, in the quiet of the night, I have come. Walking, I have already arrived at the bedside. Seeing her, she is gasping for breath with tears streaming down. One moment calling "Sister Lin". One moment calling his "Cousin". Her almond eyes slightly open and cannot see clearly. Cousin, this aunt in your house is too harsh to me. Her words are absurd, creating right and wrong. Although the old grandmother loves me. It is a pity I cannot please the previous husband with peace. The karmic debt from a previous life has been settled in this life. Please don't look at this ill-fated person any more. Sister, cast away all your worries. You must not look down on yourself too much. I advise you to eat and drink three meals a day. Add clothes to keep your body warm. I advise you to sleep early at night, not too late. You must drink more decoctions. I advise you not to listen to the words of the sisters. They seem false, like a play, yet also like truth. I advise you to take care of your body and mind, and cherish yourself. Never think again of the old family home in Yangzhou. Hearing these words, tears streamed down. You wretch, you are most attentive to me. Cousin, please return to the Yihong Courtyard soon. Tears have soaked through the perfumed silk handkerchief. This body is not necessarily too drifting and rootless.</p>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening Chapter</p>
<p>Hangye 1180 5:30 PM to 12:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Arranged Marriage"</p>
<p>Seeing the kind face in the White Cloud Nunnery. Miss is, the news is vague, adding to the hatred. The aunt is, the evening drum and morning bell mark the years. Suffering the cold and indifferent words of the snobbish nuns. Suddenly, anger fills my chest. I order the housekeeper to be diligent and respectful in the future. Still, the lady of the Western Courtyard must be kept in the dark. Listen, I hear the sound of agreeing to each instruction. From now on, let the lady settle in. However, grieving for her son, her pain is doubled. That is, Old Madam Bi has ten thousand points of sorrow. Love binds the children. Only because the selection of imperial consorts is extremely strict according to imperial order. I pity the girls who are yet to be married. Nurturing them like flowers for eighteen years. Moreover, her temperament is gentle and her appearance is dignified. Her qin playing does not yield to Ban Ji's wisdom. Praising her weeping catkins is like praising Tao Wenxian. Wanting to select a dragon steed is difficult to satisfy. Only, the Fang family's young master is most elegant. Consulting with both sons to temporarily recruit a son-in-law. Mother, he is, the one with whom Zong Biao Songting made a previous agreement. Who knew that the lady would not adopt it at all. At once she writes a marriage agreement in the style of a flower note. Came to the plum blossom study and diligently invited her. Sitting behind the screen shoulder to shoulder with her sister-in-law. Want to call her face.</p>

<h3 id="e219">A Great Drought <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>"The Lost Lamb" Because they had to film a drought scene, the idyllic Huacun has recently transformed to present an extremely arid scene. Not only have the flowers, plants, and fruit trees in front of the village lost their vibrant color, but even the green river that surrounds the village has dried up and is full of cracks.</p>
<p>This setting fully expresses the air of rural areas suffering from drought, but such a setting can only be created with a lot of manpower, time, and money. To speak only of the river, which is more than eighty feet wide, to dry the river, the water must be pumped out. To pump the water, piles must first be driven and dams built. The scale of this project, including dam building and pumping water with machines, can be imagined. However, after spending so much time and money, what will be shown on the screen in the future will only be a shot of forty feet, projected on the screen for only three seconds. If we calculate it, the cost of these forty feet of film cannot be said to be inexpensive.</p>
<p>However, because of this dam building and water pumping, the workers caught more than ten pounds of fish to eat.</p>

<p>Xinhua Company Completes a Good Deed</p>
<p>I remember when it was rumored in Hollywood that Laurel and Hardy were going to break up, many fans stood up to express their opposition and seemed very indignant. This is because the plays they collaborated on left too deep an impression on the fans; if they wanted to break up, the fans would not agree.</p>
<p>In China, Han Langan and Liu Jiqun were long recognized as the Laurel and Hardy of the East, and they were also warmly supported by fans. But unfortunately, Liu Jiqun terminated his contract with Lianhua, and Han Langan was immediately isolated. The Laurel of the East, the Laurel and Hardy of the East, also had a breakup, which is really a piece of news that fans will find very unpleasant. But not to disappoint you, Xinhua Company has now come out to complete this good deed. The recent Xinhua film "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" is a new type of comedy in which Han Langan and Liu Jiqun are cast as the main characters. The director is Yang Xiaozhong, and he plans to make you laugh to tears in the theater, with a large number of jokes from beginning to end that you cannot help but laugh at; at the same time, attention is paid to other roles, and the female leads include Tong Yuejuan and Xu Manli, etc., who were universally praised in the past films "Peach Blossom Fan" and "Song of Everlasting Regret".</p>
<p>Now, Laurel and Hardy have not broken up, and our Han Langan and Liu Jiqun's collaboration on "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" at Xinhua Company is already half finished.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Paris Releases "Sergeant York" in Advance <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The historical war epic "Sergeant York," starring Gary Cooper, leading more than 3,000 people, which broke the box office record of the Great Light Theater, is indeed an unprecedented feat. Movie fans in West Shanghai have sent letters and telegrams requesting the Paris Theater to release it in advance during the spring vacation. In particular, students have made the most enthusiastic requests. The Paris authorities could not refuse the favor, so they had to make the premiere in West Shanghai starting today. I hope the audience will pay attention to it.</p>
