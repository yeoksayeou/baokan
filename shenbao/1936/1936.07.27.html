<h3 id="c27">為從事新生活運動者進一解 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>本市新生活運動促進會遵照總會頒發的新生活勞動服務團組織大。綱預備將原有靑年服務團一律廢止。而改以機關學校社團為單位。分別組織新生活勞動服務團。這顯然是一種改進的計劃。在推行的程序上。必能獲得更具體更宏遠的效果。可是我們還有一些粗淺的意見。希望新勞動團在開始服務時。予以充分的考慮與採擇。</p>
<p>第一。我們以為一般服務團員在執行他指導或糾正的任務時。必須注意到態度的溫和。這在客觀上是非常需要的條件。因為在許多民智幼稚的地方。根本還未曾瞭解新生活運動意義之所在。而只覺得向所固有的習慣。如今突然須受强制的矯正。若不經過一番委婉的解釋。而遽以嚴厲的面目臨之。難免會引起反感的。這不僅是一種推行新運的阻力。在奉行者先已暴露其本身未能貫澈之弱點。須知新運綱要是以禮義廉恥為某礎的。服務人員豈可不隨時體念斯旨。以身作則。一切鹵莽驕汰的行為。是絕對不容任情流露的。</p>
<p>第二。我們以為服務團員於盡其指導責任以外。更應儘量發揮互助之本能。對於恒人所保持的褊狹自私觀念。該下一番澈底洗鍊的功夫。以養成一種見義勇為的互助性。不久以前。本埠曾發生一件中學生捉盜的新聞。本報亦經揭載過。事實是這樣的。一個婦人遭逢路刧。大聲呼喊。適有一個中學生經過。便奮勇上前。截獲此盜。（大意如此）這雖然是一件細微的紀載。讀者或竟未注意到。但在推行新運的立塲上。實在是一個非常好的例子。而值得大書特書的。我國過去宗法社會裏所因襲的傳統觀念。往往錯認「明哲保身」之意義。而執著於「身體髮膚受諸父母不敢毀傷」的成見。結果不免形成「各人自掃門前雪」的局面。這當然是一種不長進的心理。在今日是應該痛下針砭的。</p>
<p>總之。新運是以改進民德為主旨。其終極目的無非為欲促整個民族之之向上。今當勞動服務時期。如果每一團員。都能從縱的方面求深切的體騐。橫的方面謀聯繫的互助。袪除國民已往虛矯怯儒之心理。以共向堅毅奮鬬之途邁進。則苦悶局面之打破。為期總該不遠罷。</p>

<p>華聯社特稿　九一八事變發生以後、日蘇關係頓趨緊張、中間雖由於蘇聯力主和平政策、事事退讓、使劍拔弩張之形勢、不致進而釀成戰爭、但因甘方態度咄咄迫人、故其今後發展究將如何、殊難逆料、日方對蘇節節進迫、曉曉不休、係藉口所謂懸案、以掩飾其　武侵略之面目、按此次懸案有三、卽國境問題·漁業問題。及石油利權問題、其中尤以第一項為日蘇衝突之直接原因、二三兩項重要性較低、但亦為兩國關係之「瘤」、隨時均有被日人援引為侵略藉口之可能、茲特將此三項懸案概述如下、以供關心日蘇問題者之參考、</p>
<p>（北洋漁業問題）</p>
<p>俄戰爭後雙方訂立朴資茅斯條約、日人獲有北樺太島之捕魚權、至十月革命成功、日本復乘各帝國主義包圍蘇聯之機會、強佔北庫頁島、攫取該島之漁權、疑來幾經曲折之後因日本對此抱有甚大之野心、故糾紛並不因此兩約而解消、目前日本在北洋所經營祗漁業、計有根據日蘇漁業條約在蘇聯領土內開辦祗漁區、年產額達四千萬元以上、蘇聯領海附近之母船式漁業、年產額達一千萬元、及北千島羣島之流網漁業、年產額達一千二百萬元、一九二八年訂立之條約到本年五月二十七日已屆期滿、依據該的第十五條之規定、締的者如欲修改此的時、應於十二個月前通知對方進行折衝、因此日本乃於去年向蘇聯提出三項原則、卽漁區安定長期延長、廢止競賣制及安定盧布、同時並要求附屬條件四項、（一）魚族保護、（二）借互費收付條件的改正、（三）禁止河川捕魚問題、（四）魚類之重量計算法等及其他各項細目、但幾經折衝尚毫無結果、將完全陷於無條約狀態、未來難免引起各種糾紛、</p>
<p>（二）石油利權問題</p>
<p>前曾經說過日本於一九〇五年乘日俄戰爭勝利之結果、訂立朴資茅斯條約、攫取樺太島南半部的主權、至一九二年又以十月革命成功、內部秩序尚未完全恢復之機會、佔領該島、至一九二五年始行歸還、可知其對於該島所抱藏之野心、日本之所以垂涎該島者、原因該島為森林石油及漁業之出產地、又以石油之蘊藏、相等於日本國內金埋藏量之數額、甘本取得在該島之石油試掘權、是在一九二九年於一月、嗣又簽訂日蘇條約、規定日本在該島有開探油田面積百分之五十的權益、其餘百分之五十以蘇聯允許外人開採時、日本得有優先權、又允許日人於十年之內再東海岸選定油礦一千俄畝、實行試採、如成續優良、又以其面積之半歸日人開探、日人在樺太島利權之條約有效期問為十年、今年十二月屆滿、日本是一個先天缺乏而又積極從事準備戰爭的國家、對於這種作為重收之國防資源的石油利權、自無放棄之理由、此日本國內要買樺太之空氣甚高、但經蘇聯只允把原條約之期限延長到一九三八年止、現日本已由北樺太石油株式社社長左近司來往於莫斯科東京樺太之間、積極計劃擴大經營、</p>
<p>（三）邊境問題</p>
<p>此項問題係日本故意藉口、用以作為侵略之烟幕、自不待言、其中包含滿蒙及滿蘇兩部份、日軍曾藉口此項界錢不明之原因、一再與蘇蒙紅軍發生衝突據結計自去年起至今年二月止、「滿」蘇「滿」蒙國境的這種衝突事件、共計有二百五十餘件、在這些事件中如金廠溝事件長領子事伴、都是作戰一畫夜、幾乎引起日蘇正式衝突的戰爭、日本因欲藉此遂行其龐大軍事計劃、轉移國際視聽、準備掠奪西比利亞、因此縱與蘇蒙迭開會議、但終托詞拒絕和平建議、蘇蒙為保衛自己權益、自不得不重駐防軍以備萬一、因此未來殊有演成日俄戰爭之危險也、</p>

<p>（東京）最近英國政府一面在歐洲大陸進行和平工作、更在香港及新嘉坡注力於常備軍之充實、與防禦設施之擴、大作為華府、倫敦海軍條約並限制太平洋設防協定失效時之對策、因其頗為明顯、故日本關係當局在注視其進展、卽自日本退出倫教海軍會議疑、一九三七年以降之無條約時代、顯將出現、英國政府遂樹立擴大強化遠東根據地之設備、逐漸以新式軍艦替代常之中國艦隊等方針、並在逐步實施、尤其於新嘉坡之設防工作、顯有進展、擴充船塢以及擴充要塞等之大部分、行將於本年底前、完畢整備、且新嘉坡之常駐兵力、亦將強化、迄現今陸軍兵力三萬人之三倍、空軍兵力亦在擴充、又在香港則樹立計畫、完成近代式之機械科部隊、對於空軍亦在擴充現在之飛機為、並念於實施新飛機塲之設置云、（二十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>江山民性強悍，紳十黨派分歧，凡到這裏當縣長的，都要感覺頭疼。過去的若干縣長，只有兩個落得好名：一個呌陳鼎新，是因公正廉潔，有幾决上面硬派下來的苛雜欵項，他知道老百姓巳是乾柴裏榨不出水來，他眞把官俸捐了去貼補；一個呌吳軼民，却是橫身是膽，遇了難辦的盜案，他竟敢化裝去把強盜抓來。自然這還不配稱他們是盛世的循吏，然而今日何日？何况又在此民窮多盜的江山？得此兩位「不愛錢」「不怕死」的縣長，無怪老百姓要口碑腹載，樂道不休了。</p>
<p>現在這位縣長周心萬，連任四五年，當然有相當的政續，不然，那裏辦得到？聽說，衢縣萃豐莊的倒閉，周縣長曾有三萬多存欵損失，向省府報銷，遭了駁斥。但另據幾位紳士的閒談，却說做縣長也有做縣長的苦裏</p>
<p>後來記者去拜訪他，他却談了幾點很有價值的政治見解：</p>
<p>他說：「第一，目前的縣政，不患無計劃，實患計劃太多，有時上峯因為所頒政令過多，運自己都記不了，復又頒佈變更方法，或前後矛盾的新令，致下面已做的，反失信於民，未做的還微幸討好。甚有政令動機本好，結果却是病民條例，例如勞役服務，挑土築路，五個外行的文弱人，往往抵不上一個有經騐的苦力。就說政府不出錢，但人民非盡有閒階級，出工就是出錢。第二，保長職務加大，也是弊多利少。例如打土匪，派積，谷辦兵差，訓練壯丁，募飛機捐五項大事，縣府還愁做不了，完全推在保長身上，使保長一人的任務，隱然成為縣府職權的縮影，結果母怪不是一有動」，便是一不動」。第三，有許多救濟農村的金融機關，什麼銀行放欵，什麼合作社組織，都不純為客觀方而發動，而是由主觀方面着想。具體些說，某一銀行所到之處，鮮有不被它吸收存欵，操縱市價的。陳立夫先生曾說：「銀行是農村的敵人」，望借救濟農村美名，以達牟利目的的金融界，深省深省。——這一席富有經騐意義的談話，赤顆顆地批露出來，賢能的縣長，當不會見怪吧？</p>
<p>間浙贛皖四省邊區剿匪總指揮部，也豎　在這座別有「玉葉」之稱的小城裏，總指揮是當年北伐時代，號稱鐵軍」的第四軍軍長張發奎氏，在一二八滬戰緊張時，曾有很多的人民和輿論，渴望這位「鐵將軍」自天而降，大顯身手。此時提起張發奎三字，讀者大概總有些耳熟。這次記者去訪他，關於國難與時事問題，他會慷慨激昂的談了許多，可是他又囑咐暫勿發表。但讀者不忙掃興，他的秘書科長王揆一等諸君，無意間又談到張氏歐遊時的趣事，却是一件很好的代替點心：</p>
<p>張氏在赴德閑的决火車上，有位　眼高鼻的德國人，看見他衣冠楚楚，態度莊重，便翹起大拇指來恭維他道：「欽佩欽佩！貴國兵力眞強，不有多少時候，便快要占了半個中國！」張氏知道那人把他錯看成日本人，不勝愧憤交集，但那人還囉唆了許多，張氏未達目的地，只好忍痛犧牲，先行下車。後到柏林，想參觀工廠，以每小時八十馬克的代價，請一位名教師教德語，張氏塡履歷表時，未直塡軍人，而假塡歷史教員，不料那教師第一次上課，看看履歷，便像若有所獲似的猝然問他：一日本不斷地侵略中國，中國有日本六七倍的人口，數十倍的土地，為什麼不抵抗？先生旣是歷史教員，請問：中國的民族性究竟是甚麼？」這又是一個難題，至今尚耿耿不忘。讀者諸君，這點心味道如何？</p>
<p>總部對於地方建設，以及改良風俗，實行強迫教育，都盡可能的領導地方推行。城內南大街，商肆櫛比，為全城繁盛區，但街道却湫　得「可以」，而且勞役服務時，新修；額「條」「牛」路，老百姓走了常竊竊私議，說比舊路要多傷幾雙鞋子，每常黃昏時節，店員臨街設座，揮扇乘凉，不但路人對面相逢，左有難讓，就是滿街充　着的那股汗氣，似乎也無從蒸發出去，現總部已令拆屋展路，並向省府請撥補助費六千元，（業已函允，尚未領下）以作修築路面之用。此事在行為上，雖不免困難，但結果能使交通便利，市容整飭，商業繁榮，故已開始積極進行，預計秋後全路築成。</p>
<p>江山僻處邊隅，人民多墨守陋俗，特別是辦喪事的，要講究什麼「七七」。卽「頭七」開吊，親友唁問不絕，「二七」作家祭並唸經，「三七」說死者始自知其死，孝眷須跪天井，澈夜號哭，以表孝思。「五七」親朋祭奠，設席欵待，並預備「七七」出殯，才算告一段落。可是那年山向利？何時眞正抬出去？在在都成問題。據調查；停於城中的靈柩，多至三百多口，這對於全城九千餘人的衛生問題，是何等的危險呀！現總部已出佈告，勒令抬葬，並規定以後停喪期，不得超出「一七」。限期快滿的這幾天，差不多時時聽見喇叭聲，爆竹聲，都是淸除這大批死人的喪樂。不過還有想把「一七」的停喪期，要求改為「三七」，望地方人士，多方加以開導，因為這樣過分的迷信，而又不經濟不衛生的喪禮，的確應乘機使力，一下把它改良成功，此不僅是喪家之幸，實亦地方之幸。</p>
<p>在現階段的中國，實行強迫敎育，已常有人非難，認為是一種空想而不可能的教育方式。因為中國教育的傅統習慣，一向是採取放任主義，自由主義，要是突然改取干涉主義，限制主義，那麼，在國情上，也許會呈現一種杌揑不安的狀態。同時一般民衆，大多數正輾轉在饑餓錢上，所謂求生之不暇，更那裏有工夫來求知？還有教師教材等問題，都是客觀環境上的堅強阻碍。但是張發奎氏在這些困難並未减少的情勢下，竟發動了所屬四省邊區五十二縣的強迫教育運動了。</p>
<p>張氏旣下决心，便以總指揮的名義，頒佈強迫教育令，並定駐紮縣江山為實騐縣，更以城廂鎭為試辦區，限期要把全區所有的文盲，一律掃除。會組織強迫教育實施委員會及幹事曾，開辦十八個簡易譏字學校，把全鎮的文盲一千二百餘人，分隊裝入這十八輛車箱，機輪轉動，強迫列車開行，果然循軌依時，達到成功之門。舉行畢業典禮的那天，記者還去參加，看見那些山十多歲至四五十歲的學生，大多數都是赤脚草鞋的人，成績頂好的，還得手錶墨盒等獎品，其餘至少也得信箋文憑等物，莫說他們個個欣欣然有喜色，卽連記者也高興的了不得！</p>

<p>大通社云、濬浦總局向德國訂造世界最大挖泥船建設號、自去年四月抵滬後、卽駛赴吳淞口外神灘、（卽銅河閃沙）開始濬挖、是項濬挖工程、迄已一年、茲將最近工程進行情形、探錄於後、</p>
<p>神灘浚工</p>
<p>建設號挖泥船、係屬世界最新拖吸式、挖泥時能照常行駛、不用下錨、故其工作効率極著、最近挖起浚區泥土量、約達八千萬方左右、（每方四噸）工作仍限於日間、現正籌劃添開夜工、第浚區因適當航道、往來船隻頻繁、事實頗有困難、</p>
<p>添造新船</p>
<p>該局預定神灘初步浚工時間、定為五年、挖泥船定為兩艘、故第二艘之建造、已於本年三月十八日開始招商投標、惟為顧及國外船商標函往返起見、時間自須充分、故究歸何國船商承造、現尙未定、至該艘挖泥船、仍為拖吸式、惟船體尙較建設號為巨、其偉大可知、需果年半、可以造竣、</p>
<p>建設模型</p>
<p>該局建設號挖泥船、係向德國雪高造船公司訂造、由本埠西門子洋行代理、當該船未造竣前、先由該雪高公司造就船體模型一具、極為精美、卽交由西門子洋行陳列、茲以建設號船業已工作年餘、使用滿意、接收手續、正式完成、故該船體模型、已由西門子洋行、送由濬浦局陳列云、</p>

<p>新新社云、今歲茶業對外貿易、因品質運銷、大事改革、售價倍增、輸出旺盛、其情形頗有復興之佳象、茲探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>倍增往昔</p>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報告、六月份上海茶葉出口、計綠茶三九·六〇七·一三公担、紅茶一二·九〇八·七七公担、其他茶一·八八〇·四七公担·共計五四·三九六·三七公担、較去年同月約增三萬公担、與本年五月份比較、則激增四萬九千餘公担、採購者為美·法·英·德·荷·摩洛哥·等國、輸出額以綠茶為大宗、紅茶僅及綠茶五分之二、因紅茶坱要不及綠茶之普遍、</p>
<p>現市仍暢</p>
<p>今歲茶業輸出旣增、而售價亦優於去年、自登塲以來、除次劣貨品外、各種高級箱茶、市價恒在六七十元之間、本月內英法俄美等國、在滬之茶商、尙極需要、如平水秀眉蝦目等類、日有數千箱之成交、尤以平水綠茶銷路最利、到貨雖期踴、仍有供不應求之勢、故外銷情勢、依然十分旺盛也、</p>
<p>好轉原因</p>
<p>至外銷突然轉好原因、據新新社記者探詢所悉、約分三點、（一）我國自謀發展茶葉以來、除實施統制運銷外、全國經濟會並與皖贛各地茶商合辦試騐塲推行科學焙製方法、品質乃日益提高、較諸印度錫蘭茶、有過之無不及、（二）英俄美法等國、雖曾提倡植茶、因土地不宜、難獲成績、（三）與華茶競爭於國際市塲之印度爪哇錫蘭諸茶、年來產量銳减、華茶適乘共乏、故一般歐莊茶商觀察華茶如能努力改、不稍鬆懈、數年後可期稱霸於國際茶市云、</p>

<p>浙上八府　浙江　地區</p>

<p>浦東新貨　俗名「百日</p>

<p>四省新秈　報載湘·鄂</p>
<p>尚有月餘　·贛·晚·等四省新米、業已出新云云、但據米業團體消息、該四省農產因氣候適宜、可吿豐收、照節令計算、往年須於兩月後出新、本年因有閏月關係、故該四省之新秈、最早於一個月左</p>

<p>— 上海之蛋業　主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之卅三）</p>
<p>（一）槪述　蛋為農家副產，全國各地皆有生產，可以作食用，又可作工業原料用。清光緒初年，已有鮮蛋運銷日本，二十七年，我國內地始創土法蛋廠，製造蛋黃蛋白，售給出口行商，開始運裝歐美。民國三年，美商在上海設立班達蛋廠，其時已改行機製冰蛋。歐戰期間，銷路暢旺，旋後年有發展。民十八年，為該業全盛時代，在出口貨中躍居第三位。近年貿易稍形遜色，大有遞減之象，此則由於各國購買力薄弱及遭受排擠之故。我華商對於品質逐步改良，無疵點可言。英國為華蛋之最大購買者，就二十四年度出口之三二，〇九，四六二元中，英國購買者占一八，四八〇，三一四元，卽占百分之五十七，故今後如何保持中英蛋類貿易，已成該業討論之重心。上海為蛋類重要市塲，有冰蛋廠六家，土蛋廠一家，各地駐滬土法蛋廠申莊十三家，經售出口行十餘家，小規模之蛋行不下五十家。我華商冰蛋廠僅有茂昌公司一家，但該公司在蛋業中可執牛耳，每年營業額約占全國出口總額五分之一，足為華商自慰。</p>
<p>（二）產地及來源　我國蛋產數量，據民十一年前農商部第七次農商統計載，全國有鷄一四七，六四八，七四六隻，產蛋四，四八九，七〇三，四二五個，鴨五二，二四九，三二二隻，產蛋一，〇三五，一九四，一三〇個，此項數字似太陳舊，祇能作為大體之參考。年來因各地非因於匪災，卽苦於水災，加以農村經濟衰落，農戶破產，蛋產自受相當打擊，同時較遠之省縣，仍以交通不便，運輸困難，雖有餘額，亦不易能輸出，此吾人所應注意者也。</p>
<p>上海為工商區域，四鄉蛋產實屬有限，其來源約分四處：一·津浦路南段，如鋼山·宿州·固鎭·蚌埠·頴州·正陽關·壽州·明光·毫州·廬州·浦鎭·和縣，下關等處是；二·長江路，如九江·安慶·大通·蕪湖等處；三·江北路，如灌雲·淮陰·寶應·鹽城·泰縣·江都·高郵·東台·興化·如　·南通等處是；四·滬杭甬路，如衢州，蘭溪·金華·諸曁·蕭山·杭縣·崇德·嘉興·平湖等處是，惟以一，三兩地輸入最旺。土法蛋製品須製成乾質，然後始能運滬，亦以江北路來源為最夥，蓋土法蛋廠集中於蘇皖一帶也。</p>
<p>產蛋區域之運輸，以鐵路為最要，輪船次之。鐵道部為獎勵出口起見，爰自民二十三年五月十一日起，將蛋品運費予以減輕，計新鮮改列四等運費收取，蛋黃之乾者，粉者，裝箱貨改列三等運費，蛋黃濕者，裝桶改列四等運費收取，蛋白乾者，粉者，裝箱貨改列三等運費收取，蛋裝桶者，改列四等。江北來滬之蛋，每件盛裝約六百個至七百五十個，津浦路每件盛裝約八百個，重量在七十五至八十斤之間，現行輕量為多，以防破碎。每百市斤運，雜費合計，大槪速路扯三元，近路扯二元。</p>
<p>（三）蛋之種類　蛋以炭·養·輕·淡·硫等質所構成，足為滋養品。我國數千年來祇供食用，而不知其有種種功用。自土法蛋廠興起，始知效法歐美，分其質為蛋黃蛋白，製成各種蛋品。茲將蛋白之種類縷述如下：</p>
<p>一·鮮蛋　為一切蛋製品之原料，如欲運銷他處，首須經過照蛋之手續，以別其優劣。照過之後，卽裝入木箱，每小箱可容蛋三百六十個，其裝箱鮮蛋，溫度不得超過華氏二十二度。</p>
<p>二·蛋製品　有乾全蛋·乾全蛋粉，乾全蛋片，飛全蛋，飛蛋黃，飛蛋向粉，乾蛋黃，淡蛋黃等各類。　蛋黃以化學品製成，又可分兩種，一用硼酸製造，一用硼酸製造，一用安息酸鈉製造。淡蛋黃亦用硼酸製造，不過去其鹽質耳。以上各種製品，大抵無鹽者多充食品，有鹽者多為工藝上之料品，　蛋黃用以硝皮，蛋白，多數充食用。</p>
<p>三·冰蛋　發明於美，為最完備最精良之製法，出品裝在特製之瓦口鐵內，每聽容量自五磅半至四十四磅不等，置放冷藏庫，運裝時用冷氣駁船，出口時藏諸冷氣艙內，可久藏不壞，又名凍蛋，為現今蛋類銷路之最大者。</p>
<p>四·皮蛋　將食鹽·石灰·紅灰·　·金鑼底·茶葉等和合，加入相當水份，然後浸入新鮮鴨蛋，約一二星期，卽告成，以北平產最負盛名。</p>
<p>五·　蛋　將食鹽和灰或員土與水拌勻，塗於蛋壳外層約月後告成，江北一帶所產最著。</p>
<p>蛋製品折合為原蛋計算比率如下：</p>
<p>凍蛋　一百二十磅等</p>
<p>於　一千一百二十個</p>
<p>蛋黃　一百二十磅等</p>
<p>於　五千六百個</p>
<p>乾蛋　一百二十磅等</p>
<p>於　四千五百個（未完）</p>

<p>（十）（七）新加坡雜碎</p>
<p>昨天在新加坡華僑團體公宴席上、匆匆的寫了一點到新加坡的情形、現在郵船已穿過麻刺甲海峽、在印度洋中向錫蘭島的哥倫坡進發、關於新加坡的情形、還有許多可以報告的、現在摘記如下、新加坡是馬來亞半島的門戶、也是商業與交通的總匯、地臨南海、與印度洋交匯的海濱、為歐亞交通必經的孔道、形勢十分險要、英國對亞洲的侵略、雖以香港為其根據之最前綫、但是大本營却是新加坡、</p>
<p>英國設一個總督、管理馬來亞半島、總督府就設在新加坡、以極少數的英國人、統治全島、一點都沒有暴露什麼弱點、</p>
<p>新加坡全市的人口、據三年前的調查統計、共五十四萬、其中華僑竟達四十二萬、本年七月一日、政府又舉行一次戶口總調查、結果尙未發表、僑胞的人數、大概是沒有减少、</p>
<p>這四十多萬的僑胞、大多是經營商業的、我們在街道上走過所看見的店舖、幾於全是僑胞所開設的、以前國內的人、都以為到南洋羣島經商、無異是去掘金子、是致富的捷徑、但是近數年來、不景氣的潮流、籠罩了全球、南洋不能例外、僑胞的商業、也日漸衰落、加以日本的傾銷政策、向南洋猛進、卽以新加坡而論、日僑不過一萬人、但是商業上佔了很大的勢力、使我們安居慣了的華僑、大受威脅、不過就大體上說、僑胞的商業、現在總算是還可以支持、</p>
<p>華僑敎育、近年來日趨發述、現在計有小學數百校、中學六校、都以國語敎授、華僑大多都是閩粵人、以前他們除閩粵語外、至多能懂英語與馬來亞土語、國語幾於不能通用、這幾年因為推進敎育的結果、幼年的僑胞、都能講國語了、學校裏的敎科書、都是由國內運來的、但是有一點涉及帝國主義的敎科書、都禁止採用、帝國主義者、要維持他們殖民地的安全、這種措施、是原在意料之中的、僑胞對祖國的情形、比國內的同胞、還要關切、他們置身海外、受盡壓迫蹂躪、天天企禱視國能一天一天的强盛起來、我們對於海外的宣傳、實在是不應忽視的、新加坡的市政、辦得十分完美、街道淸潔、建築整齊、到處樹木葱翠、碧草如茵、簡直是一個公園式的都市、治安方面、總督府以很少的軍警、維持得很平靜安寗、這是很可注意的、交通十分發達、不但新加坡市內、馬路平坦寬闊、就是馬來亞全島、雖窮鄉僻壤、公路也四通八達、鐵路除貫通全島的重要都市外並直通暹羅、</p>
<p>馬來亞土人、大都業農、出產以樹膠、椰子、波羅蜜、黃梨為大宗、椰子樹到處可以看見、雖馬路的人行道上、也栽植得很多、高大的樹幹、伸出手掌似的樹葉、結着碩大的果實、點綴成熱帶特有的風味、礦產以錫為大宗、在全世界上也佔着很重要的地位、</p>
<p>（十）（八）新加坡的新聞事業</p>
<p>新加坡的新聞事業、十分發達、計有英文報四、日文報二、華文報五、五家華文報、是（一）星洲日報、（二）星中日報、均為華僑鉅商胡文虎出資創辦、（三）南洋商報、為鉅商陳嘉庚出資創辦、（四）新國民日報、為黨報、壓史亦最悠久、（五）總滙新報原為保皇黨機關報、現成商業報紙、各報除星洲日報於每日下午五時專出晚版外、其餘都是早版、每日上午六時出版、篇幅除新國民日報為五大張外、其餘都是六大張、銷路以星洲日報為最多、的一萬一千餘份、總匯新報最少、的三千份、星洲、星中、南洋商報三家、都備有捲筒機、印刷十分迅速、營業各報都不能收支相抵、須靠津貼維持、</p>
<p>各報的版面、與編輯方法、雖不能與國內大報相比、有待改進之處甚多、但是他們做事的認眞、工作的緊張、眞令人驚奇欽佩、華僑對祖國的時局、十分關切、幾家大報、都由滬港拍發一點專電、每天早上四點鐘到的專電、六點鐘出版的早版、都能趕得上刊載、我們到新加坡的那天、各報對我國選手團的消息、巨篇累幅的記載得十分詳細、我因為寄信發電、便道去參觀星洲日報、所有的人員都十分興奮緊張的忙着籌備出晚版、兩點鐘在公宴席上所攝的照片、三點鍊已冲洗製版、籃球比賽四點半鐘才完畢、可是五點鐘出版的兩大張晚版、已把結果登載出來、至於全團抵埠的情形、更是詳盡無遺、這種努力的精神與可驚的成績、恐怕國內的大報、能趕得上的也很少很少吧、</p>
<p>在新加坡辦報最大的困難、就是政府干涉的力量太大、言論不能自由、據說總督府雖不在報紙出版前檢查新聞與言論、但是出版後如有他們認為錯誤的地方、處罰是很嚴的、動輒驅逐出境、直到現在為止、我們僑胞在新加坡辦報、被驅逐回國的先後已十五人了、所以報館編輯的責任十很重的、大槪新加坡政府所最忌的是攻擊批評煽動的文字、無論有意或無意觸了他們的忌諱、都是認為不可恕的、（未完）</p>

<p>網球各將卡遜、昨在康悌網球塲以六比四六比四·六比三擊敗柯拉沙、奪得本年上海網球第一個錦標、保持華成烟公司所贈之美麗杯（以前均誤為華成杯）一年、賽畢由華成烟公司總經理戴耕莘氏之令媳給獎、該杯式樣頗佳、價値一百七十元、如連勝三年者則得為永有、</p>
<p>昨日除公開單打美麗杯決賽外、尙有學生組决賽、唐寳嘉對李國璠、球藝相仿、表演出色、第一盤李以六比三勝、第二第三盤唐以六比二及十二比十連勝、乃以冠軍、華東運動公司所贈金星牌網拍三只、由卡遜頒授冠軍唐寳嘉（二只）、亞軍李國璠（一只）、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>學生組</p>
<p>滬江大學生唐寳嘉、在公開單打第一週卽過柯拉沙、以六比四·二比六·五比七敗北、正反手抽球殊佳、攔網亦覺可取、球位亦頗聰明、惜發球稍差、李國璠來自北平燕京大學、擬投考上海交通大學、正手抽球為其特長、發球重而有力、有美麗之表演、但每擊出一急球之後、對於還擊之準備、異常疏忽、迨對手亦還以重球時、反而疏於應付、此為唯一弱點、而此疏忽之擊决、似已成為習慣者、不能集中注意力、有以致之、其技並不下於唐君、二人均為網球界之靑年優秀人材、前途有望、</p>
<p>比賽於唐寳嘉發球開始、二比一局後、被李國墦以三比二佔先、三比三後、李國璠連得三局、以六比三勝第一盤、唐寳嘉漸見起色、每以低急之球、射入對方發球區之邊角、有時亦以深遠之球、向底綫兩邊射擊、得以四比「領前、李奪得一局後、反失去自已之發球局、下局復一再觸網或出界、唐寳嘉遂以六比二奪回一盤、</p>
<p>第三盤為决賽盤、競爭至為激烈、李國璠會以五比三佔極優利之地位、唐寳嘉沉着應戰、扳回李之發球局後、並以滑四勝自已之發球局、乃成五比五平手、李又以六比五佔優、唐又得一光局、成六比六、繼成七比六、唐反居上風、下局唐亦負一光局、又成七比七、此後唐仍一再先得一局、李刖平等之、十比十後、唐始連取兩局、而得最後之勝利、二人表演均佳、博得觀者好評、</p>
<p>在此比賽中、另有一可記之事者、比賽開始不久、唐寳嘉之球拍、忽斷一錢、臨時卽借用其决賽之對手李國璠之球拍、結果李敗於唐、黎寳駿嬉　曰、唐寳嘉借刀殺人、或人曰、此亦「以華制華」之謂歟、</p>

<p>潘萊雖很明顯因大意而矣去不少分數、然其球有力而峻急、發球允可怕、第四盤中、有四次發球一下得分、</p>
<p>奎斯脫在第二盤中、異常穩定、潘萊則錯誤甚多、兩人皆犯發球雙錯誤病、</p>
<p>比賽曾因雨停止多决、</p>
<p>奧斯汀之反手、及角度甚佳之球、得分不少、其巧妙之高球及落地球、使克勞福無法回答、</p>
<p>克勞福毫無疑義、受風雨空氣候之影響不少、着地球甚軟弱、發球甚佳、第四盤第四局除外、克勞福共僅勝三記、其獨步一時之擱網、博得滿塲掌聲、</p>

<p>— （華嘉）</p>
<p>關於命運有很多種的說法。而除了一些有朝氣的年靑人，很多人都很相信着人是由命運之神在支配着的，這尤其以一般年老的或中年閱歷已甚深的人為最相信。原因，他們閱歷一多，碰壁也多，而他們的朝氣却已跟着他們的年齡而喪失了，因此，便覺得萬念俱灰。從這消極的人生觀而生出來替自己辯護的理由，便是命運之神支配了自己—如果時運不濟，便是任何努力也等於白費的。</p>
<p>他們的理由表面似乎很有道理，可是有時一細想便覺得全是廢話了。事實常常是最雄辯的，一個人的努力常常會戰勝他的命運。否則，從古至今便不會進化，也就不會有人頻的歷史，因為如果每一個人都以命運作藉口而不去努力，不是人還比不上禽獸嗎？</p>
<p>大音樂家悲多汶曾說：「我要同命運來决戰，它不至於就完全征服了我。」這句話是很可寳貴的。無論命運是怎樣厲害的東西，假使我們和它决戰，努力去拚命，它不會就完全征服了我們的。最近，中國之所以消沉，便是有些人人不願去努力，很像束手待斃一樣。不知他們看了悲多汶這句話有什麼感想？</p>

<p>展堂先生晚年，以體弱多病，對于飲食起居，極為愼重，夏秋兩季，卽摒絕葷腥，終日茹素，雖有重要酬應，亦僅擇質料淸淡之品稍進之。前年夏季，避暑海南，某日，與鄒海濱蕭佛成等同進餐于珠江別墅中，肴饌多半為肥膩之品，胡氏不敢動箸。席將終，有名「荷葉飯」者，由侍者捧置席中，淸香四溢，海濱笑謂胡氏，荷葉飯為束莞名產，且完全以素饈佐製而成，公曷一嘗試之？胡氏頷首，稍一咀嚼，不獨鮮美絕倫，且亦香沁脾胃，不燥不膩，洵為暑季妙品。是日展老獨盡四分之一，的一湯碗之多，食畢，稱贊不已。女子公子木蘭，于讌散後，卽與廚司宋四郞商酌，聘僱為常年廚司，從此東莞之「荷葉飯」，名聞遐邇。百粵諸顯要，時至東山私寓，一快朶頤。宋入胡府後，又獻議于胡之家人，購買東莞特產之「紅腰米」煮粥，以進展公，亦甘芳可口，米粒較長于碧粳，腰有紅綫一圍，粥作粉紅色，為淸補售品，惜東莞產量不多，他處限于土質不能種植，致各省市人士，雖能聞其名，而無法一嘗美味也</p>

<p>夜的神秘，在上海，從前，總是推崇着北四川路，一二八之後，移上了法租界的霞飛路。但是低級的夜的神秘，却從大世界以東的各街道間，以及原來的六馬路四馬路一帶，向北發展到了偸鷄橋頭，更折向西，而蔓延及於北泥城橋，以及醬園弄一帶了。這或許是愛談上海掌故者，所當認為有滄桑之感的吧？</p>
<p>在晚飯之後，從日昇樓向北，在各舖子的橱窗外，都站着裏在紅綠旗袍中在鶯燕，粉裝玉琢着，待沾。在各橫街口，更是三三兩兩的伺候着，布成了有秩序的散兵綫。若在伊們身旁挨過時，把眼向伊們一瞟伊們便會得有求必應的報之以嫣然的一笑。若是在這當兒，行人把脚步放緩一些兒，嘿嘿嘿，伊們便會偸倫地吿訴你，眞個銷魂的代價，再找上一句『便宜呀』，而同時在這便宜的價格之中，儘還留着給你七折八扣還價的地步。　　這個鏡頭，在日升樓偸鷄橋，泥城橋，與北泥城橋的四點所聯成的一個面積之中，到處在演出。在幽靈也似的年紅燈光下，演出。待到午夜之後，新閘路的東端，更是列陣以待，幾乎完全佔據住了二旁的人行道。每一個雉妓的臉上，充滿着淫蕩的笑意，對着行人笑謔着。在這裏，除了流浪者之外，是找不到男性侮辱女性的迹象的。所有的，只是被侮辱的男性的倉皇奔避的窘態而已有時，還能瞧見着一個男性，被幾個賣淫的女性，半拉半摃，被擁向神秘之窟的一幕滑稽劇。</p>
<p>衛生家說，在這種塲合，空氣之中，是充滿着骯髒不過的氣氛的。若是我們的眼鏡，是有顯微鏡那麼功效的，我們準可以白瞪着眼，而瞧見無數的花柳病菌，在空氣之中活動着。這話，雖未免說得過甚，但是我人觀於那些花柳病醫生的門庭若市，我們也該可以領悟着這些神秘婦女的工作效能了吧？</p>

<p>— 閣重樓</p>
<p>我居住在上海，我還沒有享受過「海水浴」的滋味；於是在這個禮拜日，我去到那高極的「海水浴塲。」</p>
<p>日光照射在銅人碼頭的銅人上，銅人沒有像人們那樣流着汗，銅人不怕炎熱的夏天。</p>
<p>我和厚非兩個人，還有我和他的兩部脚踏車，同時在外灘搭乘上海市的渡輪，船開行的時間是上午十點三十分。</p>
<p>船載黃色的江流中行者，風很搭，浪花被吹濺在人們臉上，人士像站在無遮蓋的雨中</p>
<p>「快看那些穿紅得村姑，那些油緣的野樹，那些黃色的耕牛，那些怡然自得的鷄犬。」我指着兩岸的風景給厚非說。</p>
<p>厚非點點頭，他也是厭倦都市生活的一員。船停靠了數次，在中午的時候，便到達高橋了。高橋碼頭離海濱還有數里路程，我們有脚踏車呆以代步。</p>
<p>我們的車子經過田野，田裏的禾苗已經全黃了！南婦們在舞動着農具。看見這樣的情景，令人想到那「鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾下土；誰之盤中餐？粒粒皆辛苦！」詩句。</p>
<p>沒有一會兒，便到達「海濱浴塲」，我們先在門首購了票，在更衣室裏換過衣服，（換上游泳衣）便跑到海濱。</p>
<p>眼前的境界開展了，遠處的水天相接着，比我們來得早的一些游人，在水中蠕動着像螞蟻般的；我們　足行在沙難上，沙難上留下我們一隻一隻的足印；再向前走就到沙泥中了，泥深沒經，那有些像農人挿秧的况味。</p>
<p>水漸漸地深了！我們行到那船隻來往的地方停止；因為沒有水標，再深了就有危險。）我們開始在那日光照射著溫和的水中游泳起來：蛙式，仰泳，自由式，……我和厚非興高彩烈的呌喊着，但這喊聲却被海浪的鳴聲遮掩！</p>
<p>人像一葉小舟飄浮在巨流上，人的心上感覺到輕快；水花更殷勤的滌去人身上的汚垢，那像是受着一種偉大的洗禮。</p>
<p>海潮來了！巨浪滾滾的翻騰著；我們都回轉到岸上去，來時顯露着的沙泥，現在都給海潮淹沒了。</p>
<p>我們在岸上休息了片刻，吃了點高橋特產的酥餅，便又走上歸途；翩翩的　蝶隨著我們的車輪，像是給我們送行。</p>
<p>這次旅行雖然只是兜了一個很小的圈子，但是我的心裏却感覺到相當的滿足！</p>

<h3 id="c181">我國貨幣問題之重檢討 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 吳小甫</p>
<p>大約誰都會承認我國的貨幣問題仍有檢討的必要，以及我國貨幣方面的施設仍有改進的必要吧。但我國貨幣方面無論將來有什麼樣的新設施和改進，直至現在為止的我國貨幣問題之主要內容與成因等似乎不妨在此提出一談罷！</p>
<p>如大家所知，我國貨幣問題是與我國一切其他糾紛有着密切關係；我國貨幣問題是我國整個經濟政治以及社會問題的一個構成因，同時又是這一切問題的一個產物。所以我們提出此種貨幣問題來重新給以抽象的剖視，不能算是無病呻吟的。本篇的任務，並不是要對這一問題作全整的抽象之剖視，只是要於某些方面作一個約略的解說罷了。</p>
<p>一·中國貨幣問題的內容與成因指幣制問題呢？抑或怎樣？也許一般的均以為我們的貨幣問題僅僅是一個幣制問題。這是不充分的。我們的貨幣問題，事實上主要的包括着兩端：貨幣的關連而互相影響着的。</p>
<p>我們現在要先從縱的方面來看一看我們的貨幣問題。</p>
<p>研究中國貨幣問題的均知道，或均應知道，中國數千年來的全部貨幣史是充滿了貨幣問題，而從沒有獲得多大多深刻的解決（狹義的，餘仿此）的。</p>
<p>我們的貨幣史是給列强截分為二大部分的。第一部分為外力侵入以前的時期，卽一八四二年以前。第二部分為外力侵入以後的暑期。一八四二年直到現在卽屬于這一時期。列强的侵入，把中國一切經濟，政治，文化等等，分成兩個絲毫不能互相啣接，只是在相差十萬八千里長的距離中，以及十萬八千里深的漩渦中發生着極端可怕的衝突，矛盾，與紊亂的——這麼兩個完全不同而日趨逈異的時期。這一時期的劃分，把中國活活的支解了。而被支解的是誰呢？是受了以及更受着訴不了盡說不清的痛苦的中國大眾！</p>
<p>於各方面如此，於貨幣方面又何獨不然。在列强侵入以前，中國總久的陷在沉滯的循環的封建的小農經濟與商業資本的泥沼中。在這一泥沼之中，封建經濟時而衰落（從漢末到隋便是大衰落期——註一），時而又復興（唐朝便是如此——註二）。隨着封建經濟之一興一衰，中國的貨幣情況便表現出時而穩定發展，時而紊亂衰落的姿態，——而在總趨勢上正與中國的經濟情形一樣，中國貨幣是異常落後。是的，中國的貨幣，與中國的經濟相適應（無論那一國，在正常的一般的情形下都是如此），從漢末到隋，是非常的衰落，紊亂；唐朝的貨幣則較為安定，發展。（這都是舉例說明）。而從周朝直到清末這三千多年間，中國只是用銅，以銅為主幣，而且所用的還是極細小的制錢。自漢武帝到隋末，有名的五銖錢斷斷續續的統治了七三十五年。由唐高祖至清末（姑以清末論），通實錢更是在大致上維持了一千二百九十三年的權威，以一種極細小的制錢而能夠統治得這麼長久，亦可見中國昔時經濟與貨幣等等之如何落後了。而卽在今日，中國的大眾猶在以銅為主幣，且在窮鄉僻壤間（例如甘肅的民勤，鼎新，永昌等縣——註三），仍有應用制錢的事呢。</p>
<p>當外力侵入的當時，中國仍在可憐而又可笑的（但是那時的統治者却自覺極可倨傲）大用其「中華天國」（The　Celestial　Empire）的制錢。那時的貨幣基本固然談不上，而貨幣本位亦僅僅在事實上沿用着銅本位。雖亦用銀，但銀只居于非鑄貨的輔助貨幣之地位。</p>
<p>列强就是在這種情況之下打破萬里長城的！</p>
<p>列强侵入以前，中國經濟落後，交換不發展，故貨幣亦落後萬分。而列强旣侵入之後，以其自己的資本制模型來改造（改造成了一個什麼樣子！）中國經濟，使中國經濟劇烈商品經濟化。那麼，中國經濟與貨幣從此有欣欣向榮的發展嗎？完全不是那麼一回事。列强只是充分利用了中國經濟與貨幣等等之落後的歷史條件，使中國繼續落後，以中國為其附庸，為其尾閭，為其外府。列强只是用了並更用着種種一般的與特殊的手段，壓迫中國民族產業，束縛并操縱中國民族貨幣資本，使這一切不能作任何與列强利益相反的發展。</p>
<p>列强的大砲和商品那是不用說了，卽在貨幣方面，亦輸入了種種洋銀元，甚至還有其專門對華侵略的洋銀元（美國卽鑄有貿易元Trade　plllar輸入中國），來略取我們的脂膏。此外，更在中國設立銀行，發行鈔票，企圖以外幣直接統治中國。列强侵入以後，中國貨幣方面種種封建紛亂與割劇性大到駭人的地步。這表示着并反映着列强的扶植中國封建勢力，以售其奴役中國之計的。</p>
<p>正因受到列强之直接間接（所謂間接，係指列强扶植中國封建勢力而方，餘仿此）的侵壓，中國貨幣一直得不到正常的發展，一直受到白銀的痛苦。而且遲至民國二十二年始行確立的銀幣本位制，倐忽間又于民國二十三年十月十五日起中國卽已離開銀本位。中國銀幣本位制之遲遲而來，忽忽而去，這又是中國經濟與貨幣等等落後與危機的一個絕妙標誌啊。</p>
<p>在貨幣資本方面，中國所有由單純略取，商業資本，高利貸等等途徑所積累起的貨幣資本，除絕大部分已經被列强囊括而去之外，剩下來的一些些，則又如上所示，被列强束縛着操縱着，盡可能的直接間接使之停留在高利貸，各種投機事業與商業資本的爛泥中，使之無法作那種與列强利益相反的事業。（目前銀行投資是有了一些方向上的改變，但離開中心工業尙遙遠的很）。這樣一來，根本以市塲被奪，經濟不發展，因而無從獲得正常經濟發展的中國貨幣資本，由于無從投入中心工業的緣故，我們的產業與經濟于是更受影響，而此種結果，則又加重貨幣的病態與危機，使貨幣益發無從獲得正常的經濟發展。貨幣資本得不到發展，貨幣制度豈能單獨向上之理。而美國銀政策所給予我們種種直接間接間的打擊，那更是「落阱下石」與「雪上加霜」了。</p>
<p>這樣，中國貨幣問題嚴重到目前的田地，是列强直接間接從經濟政治等等方面侵壓的結果。中國在被侵壓之下，經濟上旣無從得到發展，甚至日益陷于危境，貨幣上自無由得發展與安定的。中國今日貨幣上的危機，正與經濟上的危險一樣，危機之最大的來源是政治的，不是經濟的，是特殊的（例如走私），不是一般的。</p>
<p>二　中國貨幣問題解決路綫的基調</p>
<p>在沒有談到中國貨幣問題解決路綫的基調以前，我們還要對中國貨幣問題的特殊性談幾句。中國貨幣方面的特殊性，有些的—例如封建的紛亂性與割據性——是較為顯着，這裏不擬多談。不過所要提出的是：中國貨幣之極端（比較的說）落後的歷史條件，與列强金融資本統治所結合造成的畸形狀態，是一個大特徵。而象中國這樣沉淪的頓於白銀的痛苦與磨折中，也是一個大特徵。</p>
<p>在目前的狀態下，誰都覺得我國的幣制有改進的必要，誰都覺得我國的貨幣資本有解放的必要，誰都覺得我國的貨幣有使之作正常的經濟發展的必要。不過在列强日益加迫的直接間接的侵害下而談改進，確實不是一件易事。金本位制，銀本位制，金匯兌本位制等等，各各多少均有其問題存在。那麼，根本拋棄貨幣來解決貨幣問題嗎？我們可以採用「物產證券」那一類的辦法嗎？那更加有問題了。這一點是很重要而且很有趣味的，讓我們附帶的多談幾句罷。</p>
<p>有少的人們因為看到社會經濟如此窘迫，看到國家財政問題如此日趨嚴重，便想入非非，以為可以把貨幣這一「禍水」根本廢掉來解脫苦惱。是的，卽就財政問題着想，亦非速在貨幣方面謀得改進不可。不過如果因問題迫切而遂從幻想中找出路，則是「治絲而益棼」。</p>
<p>從貨幣了解貨幣，正同從雲霧了解雲務了樣，是無從了解的。（本篇所謂貨幣，當然是指金銀或代表金銀的紙幣而言）。貨幣是由商品交換的過程自然生長與發展出來的。商品與貨幣是同時存在，並且將同時滅亡。如一面保存商品經濟，一面廢棄貨幣，則與一面去除輪軸而一面仍欲車輪前進一樣，那是辦不到的。貨幣是商品終濟內部發展物，是「交換」所產生的。我們不能夠從經濟外部投入些什麼「券」以代替貨幣。不用說別的了，卽以金銀而論，從經濟外部獲得大批金銀（例如戰爭的掠奪品與賠欵），自然可以促進財政的長大與經濟的發展；但金銀之變為貨幣，則亦必須經過「交換」才行。因為貨幣天生卽是金銀，但金銀却非本來就是貨幣。因此，貨幣發展的程度之高下，一視商品交換的範圍價值量（Maguitude　of　value）之大小以為斷。</p>
<p>貨幣之所以成其為貨幣，因為它自己是一個商品，是有價值的。只有本身是有價值的東西，才能夠作為一切價值的尺度。更重要的一點是，貨幣是商品社會之社會關係；廢棄貨幣，是會阻滯並摧毀這一關係的。</p>
<p>主張「物產證券」，「貨物證券」，及類似之學說的，是沒有注意到個人的勞動生產品在未經過交換之前，是不能成為社會一般的勞動生產品的，卽不能成為交換價值，不能成為貨幣的。質言之，無貨幣則各個個人的生產品或者會還返到物物交換，或者會是無法流通。無法流通固然是宣告社會的停滯，紊亂與瓦解，但物物交換亦決非現代社會所能容受。所以如果全國這樣的廢棄貨幣來革貨幣的命，結果只　革掉自己的命。</p>
<p>這是關於這一點之一些重要的解說。</p>
<p>那麼，我們應該怎樣解決我國的貨幣問題呢？解決路綫的基調在那裏呢？簡單的說一句，非第一步去除列强與封建勢力的侵害不可。但封建勢力是更强所扶值的，故「九九歸一」，目前最重要的是脫開更强所加於我們的種種直接間接的侵壓。否則所有的設施會被破壞，會被利用，並且會引起更大的糾紛與難題。</p>
<p>故從貨幣了解貨幣固無由了解，而從貨幣問題解決貨幣問題則更會是無法解決的。</p>

<p>— 伍并廉</p>
<p>基於蘇聯社會主義的經濟體系之不同，它的貨幣政策也大別於資本主義的國家。這首先應該指出的是足以左右蘇聯貨幣政策的信用制度，其所以大異於資本主義之特點，是在於「它可以有計劃地利用所有的貨幣資財。……因為蘇聯底一切信用機關都集在一個東家—蘇維埃國家—的掌握之中」。因為這個原故，所以它能夠「實行了分配這些貨幣資財底一定的政策，於是它就能夠大公地促成蘇維埃經濟中社會主義原素的堅固與發展」。因為信用制度在社會主義的經濟部門中起了很大的作用，所以政府必須鞏固了它底中央信用的機關，完成它的信用系統。這樣，蘇聯的國家銀行，工業銀行，農業銀行，合作銀行，中央建築銀行，國家貿易銀行…就組成了這個信用體系，而担負着蘇維埃經濟部門中的特殊任務由於這個原故，政策就授予了國家銀行以紙幣的發行權（The　Right　emission），以從使金融的活動和流通。因之，信用制度之於蘇聯的貨幣政策，自然也就起了很大的作用。</p>
<p>在前俄國是一個長期金融紊亂的國家，信用制度幾乎完全破壞。一直到十九世紀中葉，才一度採取了銀本位，穩定了一些時期。從十九世紀末葉至歐戰時為止，實行金本位制度，這時期比較穩定得長遠些，但是大戰一爆發，由於紙幣的濫發和存金額的减縮的原故，信用制度又為之全部破產。這直到蘇維埃政策成立，仍因應付國內戰事和國際帝國主義的圍攻的緣故，戰費的籌措也不得不採用同一的政策。因之紙幣充斥，物價飛漲，在一九二二年的前夕，盧布的價格，已達到戰前一盧布等於二十八萬八千紙盧布的程度。當時的計算，就非以「百萬」為單位不可。由於計算技術上的不便，蘇維埃政府不得不更改了紙幣的技術上的不便，蘇維埃政府不得不更改了紙幣的名程，這結果，在一九二三年發行了一種紙幣，一盧布，就等於一九二一年所發行的一百盧布的紙幣。然而這種交換名稱的辦法，亦是减輕了計算的麻煩，不能完全停止紙幣價值之不斷的降落。因之一方面是妨害商品正確的計算，阻礙工商業的發展。一方面也無形中加重工農勞苦大眾的負担。所以蘇維埃政府不得不急於解決這種紙幣充盈的現象，實行改革幣制。到了一九二一年十月，政府創設了新的國家銀行，以担負調劑金融的任務；這銀行受財政人民委員會的支配，資本額為二十萬萬蘇維埃盧布，約合當時市價一千五百萬金盧布。一九二二年十月，國家銀行接受了政府的命令，開始發行一種新貨幣，名為Chiervoniets,—卽十盧布的金圓票。這種新的貨幣單位，作為穩定蘇維埃國家金融紊亂的基礎，而新經濟政策亦卽在這一年中開始實行，這在蘇聯的歷史上頗具偉大的意義。</p>
<p>當時Chiervoniest的價值有二五％是由金子和穩固的外國金幣做擔保的，而其餘的七五％，就大都以期票或商品來做擔保。然而它並不能作為塡補國家預算的不足，所以預算不足之數還是從前一樣要用蘇維埃紙幣來彌補，因之，當時紙幣的價值還是加速的下降。</p>
<p>而事實上，改革幣制的完全實現，還是一九二四年以后的事，因為這年的二月五日Chiervoniestr區別在：　Chiervoniest底價值至少不會低於十個金盧布，而國幣則低於十盧布，有一元，三元，五元盧布之分。　國幣由國家金發庫局發行，而Chiervoniest則由國家銀行發行　Chiervoniest是以金子和外國金幣等來做擔保的，而國幣則完全沒有這些擔保。當時穩固國幣的辦法是：A國家負使國幣按照Chiervoniest的市（卽一個Chiervoniest等於十個國幣盧布）而流通，使它能夠毫無阻碍地與Chiervoniest相交換。B國家所發行的國幣數量，只能以作為兌換Chiervoniest所必需的為限。</p>
<p>當時除宣布發行國幣的命令而外，還頒布了關於鑄造和發行銀幣及銅幣的命令：銀幣分一盧布，五十戈比，二十戈比與十戈四種；銅幣則分五戈比，三戈比，二戈比和一戈比四種。其中銀幣之間，價值一盧布和五十戈比者，其貨幣中含有較高的金子價值，故又分之為「高值」，而其餘二十戈比與十戈比兩種，則為「低值」。</p>
<p>這新計劃一實現，就立刻停止了蘇維埃紙幣的發行，而以一國幣盧布等於五百萬之蘇維埃紙幣的市價來兌換，把蘇維埃紙幣完全消滅了。金融紊亂的現象就不再存在，而蘇聯的經濟也就得到一個堅固的貨幣單位了。</p>
<p>自一九二九年以后，蘇聯實行了麵包券制，國內物價受了規定，不能統一，國營商店及消費合作社遂隨之而出現。因為國營商店與消費合作社售貨的價格和領有麵包券證之工農無產階級不同，其價格恒貴於一般售價數倍。而且，國營商店是必須使用外幣的；這種制度在當時為了鞏固蘇聯的經濟這一點上，自然有重大的意義。不然，蘇聯底社會主義的工業建設，就不能順利地進行。到了一九三〇年，蘇俄的財政卽感困難，原因為五年計劃的實踐和各組織的臨時要求，每年預算決算須增加和追加巨額的資金，所以要按計劃發行公債和巨額的紙幣，以資彌補。但是商品的生產必須與之相適應，方不至破壞通貨與物價的平衡。然而這一年的工業就不能充分進行這一地步，輕工業部門首先在貨量上都如此。這結果，使工業財政計劃受了影響，需要追加巨額的資金，而另一方面，集體農塲和國營農塲之突破五年計劃，迅速地發展，也需要巨額的補助資金。卽是如故，國家銀行和財政人民委員會不得不超計劃以上的紙幣發行，以資應付。</p>
<p>按蘇聯通貨的增加率，通常為三零％，而當年（一九三〇年）初間，蘇聯國幣的發行已達二十二億盧布，紙幣的發行達三十八億盧布，公債的發行達二十四億盧布；通貨的增加已經很浩大。而一九三零年的四月至十月間，又照常的增加率增至四八·五％，到年終竟增至六一％，比通常超了一倍以上。這巨額的增加，使蘇聯貨幣制度的安定立刻起了動搖。所以這次財政困難的嚴重，也就可以想見。</p>
<p>這時期，蘇聯政府鑒於這種危急的情勢，立刻令財政人民委員會停止第四季為穀物準備委員會，經濟建設，文化建設……等大量的資金需要的紙幣發行。而紙幣發行的停止，又使通貨停滯在國民的手裏，不能轉入國家銀行的金庫中。同時輕工業增加率的低微，也無法吸收國民的購買力，於是國家銀行不得不停止支付，以挽救貨幣之不足。</p>
<p>這樣，由於通貨的動搖和國庫的空虛，蘇聯政府不得不從客觀情勢中設法去克服這種困難，不然整個經濟體系，就陷於破產。因之。政府就立刻捉住了當時幾個特徵去嚴重執行：</p>
<p>（一）擴大產量的增加，提高勞動生產性的運動；</p>
<p>（二）克服經營的不經濟，建立經濟清算制度，系統的减低生產費，嚴格追求利潤，加緊工業內部的積累</p>
<p>（三）克服財政計劃的不嚴格招待。並因之而聯系到財政計劃，租稅制度，信用制度…的改革等等。</p>
<p>這次的困難，到一九三一年初間才完全克服。而五年計劃，才突破了這許多困難，而得到偉大的發展。這也說明了一九三五年十二月一日，蘇聯國家銀行公布再度改革幣制的意義。這就是說，貨幣制度的推移，是隨着經濟的發展而變動的。這幾年來，蘇聯的經濟已有了飛速的進步，漸漸成為一個自足自給的國家，國民經濟日益改善，則其幣制之變更，自是當然的事。</p>
<p>這幣制的改革，是與蘇聯的國民經濟的改善相適應的；牠和麵包券制的廢除有很重要的關聯，而且也同具着很偉大的意義。</p>
<p>在以前，國營商店之設，是與麵包券制同時實行的，大體是為了便於沒有領取麵包券證的人們的購買，這是由於防止糧食恐慌的原故。現在麵包券已經廢除，糧食工業的發展足以供給，則國營商店自然也就隨之取銷，這是無可疑義的。</p>
<p>國營商店取銷以後，蘇聯的貨物的價格逐趨於統一，沒有以前那種特異的區別。同時，由於盧布價值之提高，工人的工資也就無形中增加。另一方面，生產的進步，也促進物價的低落。據去年十一月九日塔斯社通訊云：「本年九個月內，工資總額較上年同期增加二三·二％而過去十個月內集體農塲物價則跌落二〇—二五％。」同時，哈瓦斯電也說：「自明年一月起，零售物價，將抑低一五—四〇％，工資亦將减低，但减低之比率，不如製造品及食糧價格减低之甚；換言之，表面上工資雖見减低，而實際工資，則反見增加。」從這裏可以窺定蘇聯的工農生活的改善，已達到如何程度。</p>
<p>由於取銷國營商店的原故，對於外國匯寄蘇聯居民的欵項，也就取銷以外幣支付的辦法，完全以蘇聯的法幣支付。由是之故，政府並規定其行市為每一百盧布合一·三三三法郎，但到今年一月一日止就不適用，而把它提高到一盧布合三法郎的價格。國外匯兌亦因之而起了變動，從前匯價每一盧布約合十三法郎六十生的，但是外僑方面，因有國營商店行使外幣，所以都不願意照這市價兌換盧布，而實際上，盧布的購買力，從前不滿之法郎，自定為之法郎後，外僑的生活程度不免抬高。但是現在蘇聯的物價還是不斷的降落，則盧布的購買力也就隨之增大，外僑的生活也就不致因之而吃虧。</p>
<p>自這次幣制重新改革以後，蘇聯的國際匯兌當更形穩定，自屬無欵，這之於蘇聯的對外貿易上，尤有重大的意義。在國際貨幣戰爭反形尖銳的今日，我們追溯一下蘇聯的貨幣制度的進展，及其在經濟建設中的作用，未嘗沒有意義的。</p>

<p>色慾亢進，本為一種病態。耗損元氣，莫此為甚，然許多淋病患者，因疾患纏身，日久不去，精神遂陷於萎頓，而呈虛性之興奮，色慾亦緣是亢進，遺精頻繁，致起精神反常，於是厭世悲觀之念，隨之而生。頹廢因循，不思醫治，毒菌日形繁殖，身體益就衰憊，終之作淋菌之犧牲品，至可嘆也。許多有為之靑年，往往染到此病候，以為身體堅強，延不醫治，因而轉成慢性，尿意頻數，陰　刺痛，會陰肛們等部，悉覺鈍脹不舒，小便時常起痙攣性之射精感覺，遂使色慾亢儘陰　易於勃起，夜間甫一交睫，即遺出精液。往後繼之以血，變症皆出。心神界交瘁。</p>

<p>此等早衰之挽救，從前尚無適當方法，然自梅倫氏發明男用「補體康」女用「補女容」後，此男女兩方面之痛苦，悉得解除。此二藥係採取勇壯動物之睪丸與卵巢荷爾蒙所製成。會用衰老之天竺鼠試行注射後，在短期內即覺活潑，春趣盎然，並用其他動物試騐，皆得圓滿成攻。舉凡男女之不孕，發育不全，頭昏目眩，失眠心悸，腰疼背酸，健忘意懶等，以及男子之遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅，女子之月經失調，萎黃病等服此二藥，均無不奏效，實醫學上一新發見也。宜歐美醫家，大為償用。</p>

<p>急性淋誤診之害</p>
<p>患者王玉潤君，在急性淋時，包皮腫脹，道尿口膿液充塞。尿意頻數，而每决排尿又起劇烈疼痛。私購某劣藥，與行不良之手術。反將淋菌深為引入，致成可怕之膀胱炎，尿後見血，其沉澱物甚衆，淋絲浮游尿面，少腹膨脹，小便幾成　閉，體溫升騰，將成尿中毒之危險。乃改投余處醫治。除為之行放尿手術外，即囑服淋病特效藥「克淋儂」以利尿消炎，鎭痛淸毒。的至三星期左右，淋症已去六七，更繼續服「克淋儂」至十餘天，所患良已。迭經檢查，毫無淋毒反應。王君自悔前日誤服劣藥之失云。</p>

<h3 id="c202">革除小賬陋規 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>「小賬」是一種陋規，有革除的必要。我國各地旅館，茶社，酒樓，飯館，浴室，戲院，理髮店，以及共他娛樂塲所，大都有收取小賬之例。各業普遍行之，已成為一種例規。酒樓飯館，就公然掛上「叨蓑光顧小賬加一」的招牌。不但如此，更無理的，在小賬之外，茶房或侍者，又要索取酒錢？這算是額外的小賬。而且小賬的數目，是有一定的，額外小賬則無。因之茶房侍者，往往有任意强索等情。這不僅於顧客不方便，於各業的營業上，也有不少的影饗。</p>
<p>這次新運總會，有鑒及此，以各業收取小賬，實有違新生活的精神，乃訂定「取締額外小賬實施辦法，」分發全國各地新運會推行，以便革除這種陋規。</p>
<p>不過這里必須注意的，收取小賬的陋規，與茶房制度，有密切的關係。我國各地旅館酒樓，其雇傭查房待者獲工友，不都薪金極低，甚至沒有薪金。而以小賬收入作報仇。這在營業者方面，當然上算，派顧客出錢雇伙計。就是茶房及工友，也不算白做。而且手腕高德，有時小賬所得，還要必普通的薪金多。這也是强索酒錢的由來。故我們以為要取締小賬，根本須改良各業的茶房制，客人稱便。這是最好的例子。</p>
<p>近來本市一部份遊戲塲，自動取消小賬，這於營業上，必很有益。我們希望各業，也能相繼效法，革除小賬陋規。這或許是振興生意的有效方法。</p>
<h3 id="c203">蚊烟香 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 李因非</p>
<p>推開窗，前面就是一片大草地。</p>
<p>這草地原是一塊荒塲，我搬來這裏你向時侯，便荒着了，現在上面長着很茂盛的香草，黃昏的時候，這裏有成羣的孩子來蹴球，作為球塲，而到晚上，這裏又成為蚊子的大本營，嗡嗡地到處亂撞。</p>
<p>幾决想裝個紗窗，可以拒蚊子的侵入又可以又擋住風，但每决總因為錢不凑手而作罷。要關起窗來吧，蚊子是少了，但可受不了悶熱，要不關呢，雖有了風，但也有了成羣的蚊子，撞着人的脚膀，在人的耳朶旁嗡嗡地擾個不休，呌人連看一點書或寫幾個字都不成功。</p>
<p>於是乎我不得不乞靈於蚊烟香，希冀借它的大力，來換得一些淸靜。—在這麼好的凉風習習的看裏，不是正該看一點看，或寫一點東西嗎？</p>
<p>蚊烟香點起來了，我還特地替它備了一個香籠，看那繚繚上昇的淡藍色的輕烟，我有了舊詩人那樣輕快的感覺，覺綠就為了增加一點所謂「詩意「點上一盤蚊烟看也是値得的。同時，那亘「斜倚薰籠到天明，」「紅袖添香」一類的詩句，也給記起來了。</p>
<p>享受着淸風，若那雲端掛着的一重新月，看那窠現的繚繚上昇的靑烟，聽着那草地上時起情落的蛀聲，墻下乘凉的人們的談話聲也顯得糢糊了。這是一個詩的境界。</p>
<p>但這個詩境立刻給現實拉了回來，蚊子們不在耳朶旁嗡嗡的呌囂，它們全集中到書桌下面去，在腿膀上亂撞亂飛的，腿膀上便頓時又癢又腫起來。</p>
<p>用花露水把癢的地方擦了，在書桌下我又點起一盤蚊烟香來，這一次，我是用勝利後的輕蔑的笑把自來火擦燃了的，我的心也輕輕地跳着說道：「我有比更你好的武器，看你再怎樣對付我！」</p>
<p>這樣，我堅持了好幾夜，蚊子祗能躱在陰暗的每落裏，拍着無力的翅膀。</p>
<p>有時，我聽到墻下的乘凉者用扇子趕着蚊子，我的臉上更覆出勝利的光輝，我自已稱讚我自已的聰明，覺得那些用扇子趕蚊子的人們實在太笨了。</p>
<p>有一天，有一位遠地的朋友來了一封信，那信上是報吿我該地農民抗捐的事情，說是農民因為納不起捐而抗捐，軍警用武方來彈壓，結果引起了一塌衝突。我的那位熱情的朋友，，因為目睹那樣慘劇，於是悲憤之祿，便用筆墨來發他的牢騷了。</p>
<p>當天晚上，我打算寫封回信給他，勸他理智一些，不要這樣情熱，尤其是在內地，過份熱情了有時反而今於人無補於已有損的，但當我坐在書桌前，習慣地預備點起蚊烟香的時侯，我發覺蚊烟香祇有一盤了，翻翻抽屜，抽屜裏也紙散亂地躺着幾個銅子，於是經過短短的考慮，覺得「詩意」究竟沒有實用來得重要，於是决定把它放在書桌下。</p>
<p>信寫了一半我跌在現思裏，我不相信我能將說服他，一個有血肉有熟情的靑年，身處着歷史的悲劇中，是不能隔岸觀火的明哲保身起來的。</p>
<p>我為這問題苦惱着，筆也停滯了寫不下去，蚊烟香一圈又一圈的縮小，終于熄了，我饑餓的重着它，終于在這上面答得了一個答案。你時饑餓的蚊子又在四週向我圍攻了，並且大概因為饑餓的緣故，它們可得格外兒。</p>
<p>我把寫好的信撕了，在蚊子的圍攻中，把用蚊烟香的經過吿訴了他，旁的！我沒有再說什麼。</p>
<h3 id="c204">虛僞 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 雪野</p>
<p>——旅途雜記之二</p>
<p>因為住慣了都市，一切的生活習慣也不知不覺地都近代化了。所以當着跑進了這一半是露着近代文明的姿態而又拖着一條封建時代的尾巴底古城，却覺得處處是新鮮，顯現在眼裏的是已經淡忘了的奮社會的暗影。</p>
<p>在旅行的出發之前，就知道這古城是有着一種不可侵犯的尊餒，因為，這裏是一個中國固有道德的實行區，過慣都市生活的人，也許會忘去了我們的固有的道德而觸犯了這莊嚴的聖地。所以，當到了這裏的時侯，處處的形態都使我格外的注意，滿想在這裏找尋着我所要知道的尊嚴和道德。</p>
<p>一個友人吿訴我，你在這古城裏會看不見那妖媚的賣淫婦，會找不到黑籍的同胞們，會聽不見竹牌的音響，會買不到那走私的劣貨，總之，所見的是莊嚴和乾凈。在起初，友人的話我是信任的，因為這是實行固有道德的古城。但是在雨天之後，夢想是給事實推翻了，對於這古城使我起了懷疑。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>是到這裏的第二天，我在商業區的馬路上走着，閃現在眼前的是各種的貨品，而貨品之中，劣貨却是隨時的飛入眼裏，這使我也就更加注意的辯別了。因為自己從前也是做過買賣的人，對於貨物的認識總還有着充分的自信力，從這時起古城給我的信仰就在心裏動搖了。</p>
<p>為了欺騙自己，總還認為那是奸商的鬼計，但在眼前所跳現着的事物，又一件件的發生了，已就動搖的信仰，終於走下了破滅的深淵。</p>
<p>——妖媚的賣淫婦雖沒有掛着招牌，但從公共地方的熱鬧去處，却滿佈了陰森森的妖氣，在報紙上也有着淫蕩蕩地描寫或者是報告。</p>
<p>——明文上雖說是拿人俸給者是應該守法的，然而每晚飛散在夜空中的拍拍的聲音，却是從那有俸給者的家室中流出，知法而犯法，是古有先例了。</p>
<p>——其餘，說不盡的一切的道德都給破壞了，友人所說的莊嚴和乾淨，是在現實之下，給染污去了。</p>
<p>中國人是愛虛偽的，在我們日常生活裏，是到處的在表現着虛偽的影子的，然而當着與現實一接觸，虛偽顯出來的就是難堪的醜態。</p>
<p>在虛偽的古城裏過了三整天的莊嚴的生活，終於在一個炎熱的午間，踏上了旅途的走出了古城的聖地，舉頭瞭望着廣漠的原野，沉悶着幾天的心，也好似得到了一種解放而格外的舒適。</p>

<p>— 林納</p>
<p>下着雨，夜色完全夜空　着濃</p>
<p>在十五支光柔弱的燈下，我焦悶地翻開了書頁，或許在里面，「我能發現了點什麽！」我想；然而，沒有！我一點也沒有找到，好像找不出自己為什麽這麼悒鬰的原因一樣。於是，我底灼熱的眼睛從書頁上絕望地掉開了，望住那沉沉的，黑暗的蒼空。</p>
<p>在蒼空里，密集着網眼也似的細雨柱，黑夜用它底龐大的，笨拙的軀體，在震抖着。</p>
<p>黑暗，黑暗，就只是這些黑暗啊！我氣悶地從椅子上站立起來，提起足，於是輕輕地，在房子裏踱起來了。</p>
<p>忽然，我感覺着有一個思想，在我底腦子裏波動着，接着便慢慢的擴大起來，而成一個活生生的，現實的影像。那是一個面孔，一個熟稔了蒼白的面孔，那是華！我低聲的對自己說着，一個富有神經質的，矮小而且易於感傷的女孩子。在去年的今天，我在銘處認識她，那時她還是一個活跳跳，有說有笑的女孩子；可是，後來她變了，完全地變了，變得那麼地沉悶和憂鬱。有時她跑到我這邊來，輕輕的用拳頭敲門，但當我跑出去開，而且請她進來時，她便遲呆地用她底失神的眼睛向我注視着，有一會，才感傷地用發抖的聲調自己喃着道：</p>
<p>不！我不能進去，他們不能帮助我的，這沉悶的生活啊！於是她默默地提起脚，掉頭走了。這使得我那麼地吃驚，而且緊提着脚跟跟着，直到她在弄堂外的路燈下消失了，才又悻悻的轉回頭。然而，我沒有忘記，她用興奮的聲調說着的話：不！我不能這樣下去，我一定不能……，不能，是的她不能這樣下去！於是我嘆息了。</p>
<p>然而，在這時，我底耳朶又不斷地被震嚮着，好像有一種低低的，顫抖的聲音在呌着：不！我不能這樣下去，我一定不能。……我愁悶地把頭低下了，一種異樣的衝動，使我從衣架上抓下了那唯一的舊外套，套上呢帽，打開門出去了。在遠遠我還聽着，那顫抖着了的聲音。……</p>
<p>街，冷靜靜的，那油光的路面上已經濕了，輕輕的在強烈的燈光下閃着光。</p>
<p>我走着，不顧一切地走着。在這死寂的街上，我聽不到什麽異樣的聲息，我看不到異樣的陰影。有的，只是我自己，單調的步嚮，伴着孤瘦的陰影。</p>
<p>在轉角處，我忽促地止住了。一種潛伏的思想，這麼有力地在我底腦海裏活動着，這使我想起，那兩個月前的事。在兩個月前華不是失踪了嗎？我為什麽現在又要去找她呢？在她底狹小，隘擠的小房間裏，現在該是陰森森的了；燈光，那明幌的燈光，也許就要在寬大的窗前消失了。我底心不安靜地抖動起來了，而脚步也就不自然地繼續移動着，向另一方，那不可知的黑暗中。…………</p>
<p>地段是越來越荒寂了，先是大街在轉角處消失了，接着燈光也沒有了。而在這時，是一切也沒有了，黑暗伴着細密的雨珠，斜打在人們底面上；然而，我沒有覺得它令人感到冰冷的，不！我底心是混亂而熾熱。</p>
<p>忽然我感覺着全身都冰冷起來了，當我恢復過了意識後，才知道自己已完全浸在濃密的雨柱中了。在這兒，四周是寬廣的，黑暗在洋溢着。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has decided to first reorganize the assets of the Guangdong Provincial Bank and reorganize it into the Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank to act as the agent for the receipt and expenditure of the national treasury. Then, in accordance with the reform plan, legal tender will be transported to Guangdong, and the original silver dollar system will be changed to the Yuan system. According to the declaration of the Ministry of Finance on November 4 of last year, all silver stored in Guangdong will be centrally managed by the state. As for the Guangzhou branch of the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, Qu Fangpu, Chen Weizhou, and others will revise the committee. Guangdong has always used the silver dollar system, which is a deformed form of the domestic currency system and has long been an obstacle to currency unification. In the future, the Yuan currency system will be used, opening a new era in the history of unification. As for the Guangdong Provincial Bank, it was originally the Central Bank when the National Government was in Guangdong, but Chen Jitang later changed it to the Provincial Bank. It is heard that the actual financial situation in Guangdong is that there are only private investigation materials for the nine years before and after the 16th year, and there are no official records.

<h3 id="e27">Further Clarification for Those Engaging in the New Life Movement <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association, in accordance with the general outline of the New Life Labor Service Corps organization issued by the General Association, is preparing to abolish all existing youth service corps. Instead, it will reorganize them into New Life Labor Service Corps based on units of institutions, schools, and social groups. This is clearly an improvement plan. In terms of implementation, it will surely achieve more concrete and far-reaching results. However, we still have some superficial opinions. We hope that the new labor corps will give full consideration to and adopt them when starting their service.</p>
<p>First, we believe that service corps members, when carrying out their guiding or correcting tasks, must pay attention to a gentle attitude. This is an extremely necessary condition objectively. Because in many places with low levels of public intelligence, they simply do not yet understand the meaning of the New Life Movement. They only feel that their inherent habits are now suddenly subject to compulsory correction. If, instead of providing a subtle explanation, a stern demeanor is immediately adopted, it will inevitably cause resentment. This is not only an obstacle to the promotion of the New Life Movement, but it also exposes the weakness of the implementers themselves in failing to carry it out thoroughly. It must be understood that the New Life Movement's principles are based on propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. How can service personnel fail to constantly embody these principles and lead by example? All rash and arrogant behaviors are absolutely not allowed to be expressed freely.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that service corps members should not only fulfill their guidance responsibilities but should also make every effort to develop their inherent ability to help each other. They should make a thorough effort to wash away the narrow-minded and selfish concepts maintained by people, and cultivate a spirit of mutual assistance and courage in the face of injustice. Not long ago, a news story about a middle school student catching a thief occurred in this city. This newspaper also reported it. The facts are as follows: A woman encountered a robbery on the road and shouted loudly. A middle school student happened to pass by and bravely stepped forward to intercept the thief (the general idea is like this). Although this is a minor record, readers may not have noticed it. However, from the standpoint of promoting the New Life Movement, it is indeed a very good example and worthy of special mention. The traditional concept inherited from our country's patriarchal society often mistakenly recognizes the meaning of "preserving oneself wisely" and adheres to the prejudice that "the body, hair, and skin are received from one's parents and must not be damaged." As a result, the situation of "everyone sweeping the snow in front of their own door" is inevitable. This is of course a kind of unprogressive mentality. It should be severely criticized today.</p>
<p>In short, the New Life Movement is aimed at improving public morals. Its ultimate goal is nothing more than to promote the progress of the entire nation. Now, during the period of labor service, if every corps member can seek deep experience from the vertical aspect and seek connected mutual assistance from the horizontal aspect, and remove the past hypocritical and timid mentality of the people, and move forward together on the road of perseverance and struggle, then the breaking of the depressing situation should not be far away.</p>

<p>Madrid Our reporter visited the government army positions in the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital yesterday. The impression I got was that the rebels seemed to be withdrawing from the northern positions of the Guadarrama Mountains and returning to the provinces of Segovia and Burgos to plan for the future. According to reports, the Leones mountain pass has been occupied by the government army. Previously, reconnaissance planes belonging to the government army saw the rebels preparing to withdraw on the north side of the mountain pass. Infantry teams climbed the Leones mountain pass yesterday morning and fought fiercely all day before occupying the mountain pass in the afternoon. As for the government army's ammunition and food, they were transported from the capital by trucks and were very sufficient. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Rebel planes today carried 500 Moorish troops from Morocco to Spain, preparing to attack Malaga. Once Malaga is captured, the army will join the southern rebel army and march on Madrid. Other rebel planes bombed and shelled government warships in Ceuta. However, observers here believe that most of the shells fired by the warships hit their targets. The warships shelled Ceuta today in order to prevent the rebels from transporting reinforcements to Spain. A total of five ships participated in the bombardment. By noon today, they had fired 500 shells. The rebels also returned fire. One shell hit the warship "Jaime Primero," causing considerable damage. At the height of the fierce battle, the British cruiser "Repulse" sailed into Gibraltar Bay from Malta carrying the 2nd Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders. (National Telegraph on the 25th)</p>
<p>Barcelona Lieutenant Colonel Santino, commander of the air force of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, recently announced that planes under his command were still bombing rebel forces in the area around the city of Zaragoza today.

<p>Barcelona The northern city of Zaragoza is still in the hands of the rebels. Government troops are now joining forces with the land and air forces and attacking in separate routes, hoping to restore it as soon as possible. One route, departing from this city, has now arrived in Bujaraloz, 85 kilometers away from Zaragoza. Another route, departing from the city of Tarragona, has successively recovered the two towns of Gasper and Gallinera southeast of Zaragoza and is now concentrated in the Anganés area. There are already more than a hundred air force personnel waiting for orders in the city of Lerida. Ten heavy bombers will depart from there to assist government troops in suppressing the rebels.

This was the sound of government troops bombing the rebel barracks in Lodosa. (Lodosa is where the rebels are concentrated and is not far from San Sebastian.) As for the area around Irun and Fuenterrabía, government troops and rebels are currently making preparations and monitoring each other, and a decisive battle will take place within days. The naval guns of the Guadalupe Fortress in San Sebastian have recently been moved to the nearby hills, which are suitably located on the road leading to Irun, and the situation is very dangerous. Currently, all roads, railways, telephone, and telegraph communications along the border remain cut off. Therefore, it is currently impossible to predict what kind of events will occur in the Gipuzkoa area within days. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Madrid The government is still actively organizing a militia to fight the rebels. Women from the Socialist Party and the Anarchist faction have also formed a battalion of women soldiers, not letting men monopolize the limelight. Doctors belonging to various parties of the Popular Front have also organized new associations in accordance with government orders in order to serve the government at any time. The authorities also strictly ordered all bakeries in the city to supply the militia with food. General Miyashas, ​​the Minister of the Army, visited the naval base of Cartegena in the southeast yesterday to inspect the defenses and was warmly welcomed by the government army. Telephone exchanges between the capital and major cities in the southeast, such as Alicante, Valencia, Cartegena, and Alarcide, have all been restored. After the rebels in the city of Albacete surrendered to the government army, the situation in the city has returned to normal. According to the "News" newspaper, when the government army entered the city, the rebel leaders committed suicide by shooting themselves. According to the "Fepips" news agency, the wife of General Mola, commander of the northern rebel army, has gone to Biarritz in southern France. It is also said that Mola's troops recently fought fiercely with the government army in the Guadarrama area, and 2,000 rebels were killed. The border between Navarre in the north and France has been completely sealed off to prevent rebels from fleeing into French territory. In Algeciras in the south, a rebel plane was shot down by the government army. In addition, according to news from Barcelona, ​​the death toll after the fighting in the city in recent days reached 310. An Italian expatriate named Togliotti died a few days ago. At the time, it was rumored that he died from a gunshot wound. According to the autopsy results of the authorities, it was determined that he died of fatigue. Also, according to news from Lerida (west of Barcelona), a militia column that set out from Barcelona to Zaragoza to fight the rebels has been walking for 17 hours and has been warmly welcomed by the people along the way.

<p>Madrid The situation in Spain remains unchanged today. There is no news from the front lines. However, the government army seems to have gained a slight victory near . A column of government troops led by Colonel Mangada was originally ordered to go to Avila (northwest of the capital). Because the rebels attempted to cross the Leones mountain pass (in the Guadarrama Mountains, 50 kilometers from the capital), they were ordered to change direction to Villacastín to block them. They defeated the rebels there. Several soldiers came here from the front line of the Guadarrama Mountains and told our reporter that the rebels in the Leones mountain pass area had field artillery and machine guns, as well as one aircraft. The government army originally had two aircraft. Today, several more aircraft flew from Madrid to assist in the battle and bombed the rebels there. As a result, one rebel aircraft disappeared, probably destroyed by the bombing. The northern battle news is very quiet. According to well-informed sources, the entire province of Gipuzkoa (that is, the Basque region, along the coast of the Bay of Biscay) is now in the hands of the government army. However, the entire province of Navarre (southeast of Gipuzkoa, bordering France) is still in the hands of the rebels. Also, according to news from San Sebastian (on the coast of the Bay of Biscay), many young members of the Fascist Party disguised themselves as military police and even set up machine guns on the roof of the local clubhouse to fire on the government army. When the government army noticed, they immediately returned fire. After an hour of fighting, the Fascist Party members raised a white flag, pretending to surrender. As soon as the government army approached, they opened fire again, and the battle resumed. Later, they raised the white flag again, but the government army did not believe it and continued to fire, finally defeating the Fascist Party and capturing the leader, Murs, who was immediately executed by shooting. The capital was peaceful today, and the order was good. Major hotels have now been converted into hospitals, and soldiers belonging to the militia live inside. The government also announced that the rebels entrenched in the provincial capital of Albacete (the city name is the same as the province name) and the city of Villarobledo in the province (both southeast of the capital) have recently surrendered. Therefore, the railway line from the capital to the province of Murcia (Murcia is on the Mediterranean coast, the main road between the capital and Albacete) should no longer be threatened by the rebels.

<p>(London) The battle reports announced by the Spanish government and the rebels conflict with each other, so the truth is still unclear. Today, it is rumored that the American consul and a British engineer were killed in Barcelona. Therefore, London and Washington are quite worried about the situation of British and American expatriates in the besieged cities. According to air passengers arriving in Hendaye, France, the American consul and the British engineer were both killed on the street by illegal elements engaged in looting property and burning houses. The incident occurred shortly after the authorities issued a strict order to protect foreigners. Regarding the fate of Madrid, judging from the current situation, it is still impossible to decide for the time being. According to official news from Madrid, General Mola, who led the rebel army to attack the capital, has retreated to Segovia, 43 miles northwest of the capital, after being defeated by the army loyal to the government. Three columns of troops loyal to the government are now surrounding the area, and a major battle seems imminent. At the same time, expatriates in the troubled areas are currently assessing the situation and leaving the country as soon as possible. Forty-one British athletes who recently went to Barcelona to participate in the Workers' Olympics arrived in Marseille last night on a British destroyer. When asked, they replied that they had nothing to say except to praise the treatment given to them by the Spanish people. They also said that although many churches were burned, none were looted. According to a dispatch from Gibraltar, about 7,000 Spanish refugees have returned from their residences near the border to Gibraltar and La Línea on the Andalusian border because the British authorities, deeply worried about the outbreak of an epidemic, ordered these people to leave as soon as possible. It is expected that more refugees will continue to leave. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Madrid Premier Giral issued a statement at 9:20 tonight, expressing his belief that the government will definitely put down the rebellion and saying that the government army has the upper hand. However, observers are still quite doubtful about the outcome. The entire city of Madrid is extremely uneasy, eagerly awaiting news of the victory or defeat in the fierce battle in the barren mountains 40 miles to the north. Giral said that if the government can win, it will completely eradicate the right-wing elements, and said that the government army has once again occupied the rebel stronghold of Albacete tonight. The rebels there have surrendered to the government unconditionally. A government spokesperson announced that two rebel aircraft had been shot down in the Somosierra Pass. Both sides used three-inch caliber artillery to bombard each other, destroying many small villages and resorts in the Guadarrama Mountains. The area, formerly known as Leers, was now constantly evacuating countless dead and wounded soldiers and civilians. The government army has now sent reinforcements to the area. Hospitals in the capital are already overcrowded, so the government has converted large hotels such as the Casino into temporary hospitals. According to eyewitnesses, neither side showed any concern for civilians. The rebels even disregarded the flag of the Red Cross and destroyed many tuberculosis sanatoriums, causing patients to flee in panic. (National Press Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

The French authorities, because the situation in Spain is very serious, are inconvenient to allow the two to reside in their territory, so they ordered them to move to a place farther away from the Spanish border, but did not deport them. The two have now complied with the order and moved. In addition, Minister of the Interior Salengro has also issued a notice to the authorities of various provinces in the south near the Spanish border, requiring them to strictly monitor Spaniards who frequently enter and leave the province, not to allow them to carry weapons, and to pay attention to the whereabouts of those with suspicious behavior.

<h3 id="e38">The Causes and Consequences of the Spanish Civil War Were Caused by Two Unequal Forces Yesterday <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Foreign News Agency said, Spain today seems to have entered a dangerous vortex in history, which is worthy of the attention of international figures. Since the general election in February of this year, after the Popular Front, which was combined by the left wing, won an amazing victory, the national situation in Spain has entered a state of turmoil. In recent months, there have been assassinations frequently, which made people yearn for the scene on the eve of the Great Revolution. Although the outbreak of the rebellion in various aspects this time is quite unexpected, the reasons for it have been accumulated for a long time. Moreover, the internal changes this time were initially launched by Spanish-owned African Morocco, and within a few days, they spread throughout the country. Examining the reasons for this change, we can observe it from a political perspective, and the victory in the February general election is indeed the fuse of the current civil war. According to the general election in February of this year, the absolute victory of the left wing was actually passive, because its organizational components were extremely complex. The left-wing People's Front in Spain includes the Social Revolution Party, the Anarchist Revolution Party, the Lenin's Lineage Social Communist Party, the Reform Party, and the Left-wing Democratic Party. The parties that were defeated by it on the right include the Imperial Party and the Catholic People's Party.</p>
<p>The doubts about the victory of the left wing in the election were still quite cooperative at the beginning, but later, due to the unequal distribution of rights, and because of the change of the president, the national situation became more and more chaotic. Under this situation, the Communist Party and the Imperial Party each used assassination methods to create political terror. The people of the right wing, because of their advantage in having the army, their conspiracy to seize power by means of a coup d'état became more urgent. The left-wing people relied on the advantage of the government to face the right wing, so the right-wing elements, including the Fascist Party, were eager to use the means of a military coup to carry out their reactionary plan, and this incident occurred as a result. After this change, the people in the government, especially the supply of weapons to the extreme elements in the left wing, meant that the government could quickly put down the right-wing rebellion as soon as possible, but their policy of prudence was also a big headache to consider. In short, Spain today is actually at the watershed between communism and fascism. It is extremely difficult for the moderate elements of the left wing to rein in at the precipice.

<p>Gibraltar – One hundred and forty-eight refugees of various nationalities arrived here today aboard the British destroyer "Blazing" from Malaga, Spain. Several British refugees told a Reuters reporter about the bloody tragedies they witnessed in Malaga, saying, "Barbaric and criminal events occurred there. Most of us were confined to hotels for a week, living in darkness. Peeking through the blinds, we saw over a hundred priests and Falangist members being killed by boys aged 14 to 17, dressed in short shirts, wearing red armbands, and armed with pistols, rifles, or axes and clubs." The refugees continued, stating that over 250 houses on Malaga's main streets were completely burned down, with hundreds killed and thousands wounded in the fighting.</p>
<p>(Paris) – Regarding the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, various countries remain in a state of confusion, unable to discern the truth. Their primary concern is the potential international impact, and their current preoccupation is rescuing their nationals, ensuring their swift departure. The British destroyer "Blazing" arrived at the British port of Gibraltar last night from Malaga, southern Spain, carrying 148 British and American nationals. These nationals claimed that fierce battles had taken place in Malaga, with 500 residents killed and 2,000 wounded. Corpses littered the streets, a horrifying sight. Simultaneously, the British destroyer "Boreas" arrived in Gibraltar from Huelva, southern Spain, carrying 112 foreign nationals seeking refuge. Additionally, the American Ambassador to Spain, Bowers, is stranded in Fuenterrabía, northern Spain. U.S. Embassy in France Air Attaché Major Griffith was ordered yesterday to go to Hendaye and, accompanied by the Spanish consul there, proceed to Fuenterrabía to attempt a rescue. According to a dispatch from our correspondent in Hendaye, Major Griffith has arrived in Fuenterrabía and met with Ambassador Bowers. However, Bowers stated that he does not wish to leave the city immediately because the U.S. gunboat "Cayuga" is currently stationed in the Bidassoa River (on the border between France and Spain), equipped with radio transmitters and receivers. He can still use the ship's radio to communicate with the U.S. Embassy's temporary summer office in San Sebastián. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from our correspondent in Saint-Nazaire (on the coast of the Bay of Biscay in western France), a fishing boat flying the Spanish flag and a red flag arrived at the port at 10:00 PM last night, carrying a hundred Spanish refugees. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Hengtai – U.S. Ambassador Bowers today ordered the battleship "Oklahoma" to station in San Sebastián to protect American nationals there. Bowers' summer villa is only a few miles from San Sebastián. The city is currently still in the hands of government forces, but the situation has become critical, and there is a risk of food shortages. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The government recently dispatched two cruisers and four destroyers to Spain to transport French nationals out of the country. Among them, the cruiser "Duquesne" has already arrived in Barcelona, and another cruiser, the "Bertin," arrived in Bilbao this morning. After consulting with the French Consul General there, it will proceed to Santurtzi (west of Bilbao). The destroyer "Albatross" has arrived in Valencia. The "Indomptable" and "Chasseur" have arrived in San Sebastián. The "Kersaint" is scheduled to arrive in Palma, Majorca (in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea), tonight. In addition to the aforementioned warships, several merchant ships have also been dispatched to Spain. Among them, the "Mexico" embarked over fifty nationals in San Sebastián yesterday and is scheduled to proceed to Bilbao to continue taking on refugees. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) – The Austrian and Swedish governments have recently requested the German government to temporarily assume responsibility for protecting their nationals in Spain. The Swiss government has also requested Germany to allow Swiss nationals to board German ships to seek refuge. The German government has accepted all three countries' requests and has notified the German Embassy in Madrid, consulates in various locations, and German shipping companies to comply accordingly.

<p>Madrid – Miss Scanlon, a British national who has been caring for thirteen orphans with lung disease in a war-torn city, was found today by personnel from the British Embassy in Guadalajara and brought by car to Madrid. Miss Scanlon expressed considerable reluctance and had to be persuaded, but it is suspected that she still insists on returning to the orphanage to take charge. She told a Reuters reporter, "In any case, although the orphanage building is not mine, it has been entrusted to my care, so I have an inescapable responsibility, not to mention the orphans in the orphanage." Miss Scanlon was found in the cellar of the orphanage, sitting peacefully among a group of orphans, telling them fairy tales amidst the deafening sound of shelling. The other buildings in the orphanage had all been destroyed by the shelling. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) – The cabinet held a state council meeting this afternoon, where Prime Minister Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos reported on the discussions among Britain, France, and Belgium in London. All cabinet members expressed their approval. Subsequently, the Spanish issue was discussed, and it was decided that France should consistently adhere to its traditional policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Henceforth, no military supplies, whether directly or indirectly, may be transported to private factories in Spain. The sale of military supplies and military aircraft to Spain is also prohibited. (According to past practice, government licenses are required for all military exports.) However, the export of commercial aircraft is not prohibited. The Spanish government recently dispatched several representatives here to contact the government, munitions factories, and aircraft factories to purchase arms and aircraft. The right-wing newspapers here have criticized the Popular Front government for supplying military supplies to the Spanish government, which is why the cabinet discussed this matter today. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The right-wing newspapers have expressed satisfaction with yesterday's cabinet decision to prohibit the transportation of any military supplies to Spain. The socialist organ "Le Populaire" has retorted to these newspapers, stating that when the Soviet Revolution occurred, the right-wing newspapers were the first to advocate assisting the White Army against the communists. Why are they now being unfair to Spain? (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The left and right-wing political parties in France are fiercely debating whether the French government intends to transport arms to Spain. The left-wing argues that all legitimate governments in the world should take concerted action against this kind of subversive movement. The right-wing believes that if France aids the Popular Front in Spain, then the fascist governments will inevitably come out to aid the right-wing alliance in Spain, considering this to be fair. It is generally hoped that the cabinet meeting last night would have made a decision on this issue. However, according to rumors, although the matter was discussed, it was not mentioned in the communiqué issued after the meeting. The communiqué only stated that the entire cabinet unanimously approved of the work of Prime Minister Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos at the Three-Power Locarno Conference in London.

<h3 id="e46">The Current Stage of the Sino-Soviet Outstanding Issues <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Special Article by Hualian News Agency – Since the September 18th Incident, Sino-Soviet relations have become strained. Although the Soviet Union has strongly advocated a policy of peace and made concessions in everything, preventing the tense situation from escalating into war, it is difficult to predict how its future development will be because the Japanese side's attitude is aggressive and unrelenting. The Japanese side's constant pressure on the Soviet Union is using the so-called outstanding issues as a pretext to cover up its military aggression. These outstanding issues include the border issue, the fishery issue, and the oil concession issue. The first issue is the direct cause of the Sino-Soviet conflict. The latter two issues are less important, but they are also "tumors" in the relationship between the two countries, which the Japanese may invoke at any time as a pretext for aggression. The following is an overview of these three outstanding issues for the reference of those concerned about the Sino-Soviet problem.</p>
<p>(1) The North Pacific Fisheries Issue</p>
<p>After the Russo-Japanese War, the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed, and the Japanese obtained fishing rights in the northern part of Sakhalin Island. After the success of the October Revolution, Japan took advantage of the encirclement of the Soviet Union by various imperialist powers, forcibly occupied northern Sakhalin Island, and seized the island's fishing rights. After several twists and turns, because Japan has great ambitions for this, the disputes are not resolved by these two treaties. At present, Japan is only engaged in the fishing industry in the North Pacific, including the fishing areas operated within the Soviet Union's territory under the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, with an annual output value of more than 40 million yuan, the mother ship-type fishing industry near the Soviet Union's territorial waters, with an annual output value of 10 million yuan, and the drift net fishing industry in the northern Kuril Islands, with an annual output value of 12 million yuan. The treaty concluded in 1928 expired on May 27 this year. According to Article 15 of the treaty, if the parties want to amend the treaty, they should notify the other party twelve months in advance to conduct negotiations. Therefore, Japan proposed three principles to the Soviet Union last year, namely, stabilizing the fishing area for a long-term extension, abolishing the auction system, and stabilizing the ruble, and at the same time requested four additional conditions: (1) fish protection, (2) rectification of the terms of mutual lending fees, (3) prohibition of river fishing issues, (4) fish weight calculation methods, etc., and other details. However, after several negotiations, there have been no results, and it will completely fall into a state of no treaty. Various disputes will inevitably arise in the future.</p>
<p>(2) The Oil Concession Issue</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Japan took advantage of the victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, and seized sovereignty over the southern half of Sakhalin Island. In 1922, it took advantage of the success of the October Revolution and the internal order that had not yet been fully restored to occupy the island. It was not until 1925 that it was returned, which shows the ambitions it harbored for the island. The reason why Japan coveted the island is that the island is a producer of forests, oil, and fisheries, and the oil reserves are equal to the amount of gold deposits in Japan. Japan obtained the oil exploration rights on the island in January 1929. Subsequently, the Japan-Soviet Treaty was signed, stipulating that Japan has the right to 50% of the area for oil field exploration on the island, and the remaining 50% gives Japan priority when the Soviet Union allows foreigners to exploit it. Japanese people are also allowed to select 1,000 Russian acres of oil mines on the east coast within ten years and carry out test mining. If the results are excellent, half of the area will be returned to the Japanese for exploration. The validity period of the treaty on Japanese rights and interests in Sakhalin Island is ten years, which expires in December this year. Japan is a country that is congenitally lacking and actively engaged in preparing for war. There is no reason to abandon this kind of national defense resource in the country that is a source of heavy revenue for the country. This is why the air of buying Sakhalin Island in Japan is very high. However, the Soviet Union only allowed the term of the original treaty to be extended to 1938. Now the president of the North Sakhalin Petroleum Corporation, Sakonji, has been traveling between Moscow, Tokyo, and Sakhalin, actively planning to expand operations.</p>
<p>(3) The Border Issue</p>
<p>This issue is deliberately used by Japan as a pretext to create a smokescreen for its aggression. It includes both Manchuria and Mongolia and the Manchuria-Soviet Union border. The Japanese army has repeatedly clashed with the Soviet-Mongolian Red Army under the pretext of the unclear demarcation of this boundary line. According to calculations, from last year to February this year, there were more than 250 such conflict incidents on the "Manchuria"-Soviet Union and "Manchuria"-Mongolia borders. Among these incidents, such as the Jinzhanggou Incident and the Changlingzi Incident, were battles that lasted a day and a night, almost triggering a formal war between Japan and the Soviet Union. Because Japan wants to use this to carry out its huge military plan, divert international attention, and prepare to plunder Siberia, even if it holds meetings with the Soviet and Mongolian delegates, it will eventually refuse peace proposals with excuses. In order to protect their own rights and interests, the Soviet and Mongolian sides have no choice but to redeploy garrison troops in case of emergency. Therefore, there is a danger that the future will develop into a Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) – Recently, while the British government has been carrying out peace work on the European continent, it has also been focusing on strengthening the regular army and expanding defensive facilities in Hong Kong and Singapore, as a countermeasure when the Washington and London Naval Treaties and the Pacific Fortification Restriction Agreement expire. Because it is quite obvious, the Japanese authorities concerned are watching its progress. Since Japan withdrew from the London Naval Conference, the era of no treaties will appear from 1937 onwards. The British government has established a policy of expanding and strengthening the facilities of its Far East bases, and gradually replacing the ordinary China Fleet with new warships, and is gradually implementing it. In particular, the fortification work in Singapore has made obvious progress. Most of the expansion of shipyards and the expansion of fortresses will be completed and prepared by the end of this year. The permanent garrison force in Singapore will also be strengthened to three times the current army force of 30,000 people, and the air force force is also being expanded. In Hong Kong, a plan has been established to complete modern mechanical troops. The air force is also expanding the current aircraft and is planning to implement the construction of a new airfield.

<h3 id="e48">Conditions for Italy and Germany to Participate in Future Five-Power Conference; Britain Prepares to Announce Revocation of Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(London) – Italy and Germany have been formally invited to participate in the future five-power conference, but it is still uncertain whether they will accept. Regarding this matter, "The Observer" recently reported that German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini used long-distance telephones to discuss with each other. It is heard that both of them will put forward conditions for participating in the conference. What Hitler requested is that all countries should allow Germany to develop in Africa. Mussolini advocated that the mutual assistance agreements signed by the Mediterranean countries should be revoked first. As for the latter, "The Sunday Times" reported that when Foreign Secretary Eden attends the House of Commons tomorrow, he will announce that he will revoke it. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) – Britain, France, and Belgium have formally invited Italy to participate in the future five-power conference. Italy's reply has not yet been sent. Regarding this matter, responsible persons recently stated that Italy will definitely insist that all kinds of measures similar to sanctions adopted by various countries must be abolished, and Italy can cooperate again on European events. As for Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, the government does not intend to ask other countries to recognize it. It has never made this request before, and has only notified the powers of the fait accompli. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) – Well-informed sources recently declared that Italy and Germany will definitely accept to participate in the future five-power conference. From the German point of view, Britain, France, and Belgium tried their best to avoid putting Germany before a fait accompli when they talked in London, and declared that the current negotiations should be based on the principle of equality. It is heard that German officials are very pleased with this. From the Italian point of view, the conditions previously put forward by the country for participating in the five-power conference will not be satisfied. (1) The British Home Fleet has withdrawn from the Mediterranean and returned to its original defense. The British naval power there has been reduced to normal figures. Although several warships of the Home Fleet have repeatedly sailed into the Mediterranean, their purpose is only to transport nationals out of Spain to seek refuge, just like France, the United States, Italy, and Germany have done, with no other purpose. (2) The mutual assistance agreement previously signed by Britain and the Mediterranean countries will be revoked soon. The reason why the agreement has been maintained to this day is nothing more than the following two points: (A) Internal political reasons, (B) Negotiations between Britain and Egypt are still in progress, so it is not convenient to allow Italy to act freely in the Mediterranean. Now that the British-Egyptian negotiations are almost completely completed, the government will explain the suspicions of the talks between Britain, France, and Belgium in the House of Commons, and it is hoped that a lasting solution can be found for the European situation. At the same time, it will announce the cancellation of the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement. The date is probably next Monday (28th). According to predictions in the political circles, before Germany and Italy are sure to accept to participate in the Five-Power Conference, they will ask Britain to explain the purpose of the meeting. Therefore, the three countries still need to conduct long-term negotiations through diplomatic channels. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e49">European Crisis Lurking; Formation of Confrontational Groups Forming a Pre-War Situation; Saving War Depends on Cooperation of All Countries – Speech by Sir Simon of Britain – <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>West Sussex, Canterbury, Britain – Home Secretary Simon recently delivered a speech here, elaborating on the situation in Europe, stating that the people of the three signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty (i.e., Britain, France, and Belgium) should pay attention to the light talk held in London on the 23rd of this month. However, the facts show that the people mostly ignore it, which is really abnormal. We must know that there is a great danger in Europe today. What is it? That is, the European countries have formed several groups through alliances, confronting each other and preparing for war. This situation is bad and old, and it was actually seen before 1914, which eventually led to the outbreak of the European War. Why is it being replayed now? The crisis is lurking, needless to say. The policy pursued by our government has always been aimed at reversing this situation and bringing the European countries together in one room to discuss common problems in a free and friendly manner. The reason is that common problems can only be solved by the joint cooperation and concerted efforts of all parties. A month ago, this kind of cooperation seemed quite dim, but today it has suddenly become clear, and the time for its realization is not far away. Britain, France, and Belgium have now stated that they are prepared to cooperate in order to solve all kinds of difficult problems. If Germany and Italy also hold the same view, then the gap between each other can be bridged. Do Germany and Italy also have intentions in this regard? This is what we earnestly hope for. Simon then criticized the opposition Labor Party for opposing the supplementary defense budget proposal, and criticized the pessimists who thought that war was inevitable, saying that there are people whispering privately that war is inevitable. This kind of argument is mediocre and dangerous. I will strongly refute it and hope that the people of the country will jointly close it. After our country's strength has reached its peak, it will not only not cause war, but also be sufficient to guarantee peace. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Cairo – Regarding the conclusion of a new treaty between Britain and Egypt, the delegations of both sides yesterday initialed an agreement on various military clauses. The main points are as follows: (1) The number of British troops stationed in Egypt shall not exceed 10,000, and their defense area shall be limited to the Suez Canal area. If the Egyptian army is capable of defending the territory after 20 years, then the British troops shall withdraw completely. Regarding this, if there is a dispute between the two countries, it shall be submitted to the League of Nations for arbitration. (2) The airfields built by Britain in Egypt at Abu Qir and Heliopolis shall be abandoned, but two new airfields may be built near Port Suez and Moska to replace them. (3) In peacetime, Britain may not use any Egyptian port as a naval base. If a war occurs, British warships may use these ports, but prior approval from the Egyptian government must be obtained. (4) The Egyptian government may freely increase its troop strength without seeking British consent. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the *L'Œuvre* newspaper, recently published news from London stating that the British Foreign Office had received reports claiming that Schleswig, Denmark (formerly part of Germany, divided between Denmark and Germany after the war), was in danger of being seized by the German National Socialist Party. The National Socialist Party is actively conducting propaganda work in the area, opposing Britain and promoting National Socialism. The Danish Minister to Britain was reportedly very concerned after receiving this news. Madame Tabouis also stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden plans to raise the demands of the German minorities in Czechoslovakia at the League of Nations General Assembly in September (referring to the Czech government granting autonomy to various minorities and gradually establishing a federal system). "Britain is aware that it needs at least eighteen months of preparation in military terms before it can cope with the European war. Therefore, it is determined to maneuver in every possible way to avoid all conflicts." (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

Also the receipt with sufficient stamp duty should be presented for proof, otherwise, it will be treated as a failure to affix stamp duty and a fine will be imposed. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I have read the news on page 9 of section 3 of your newspaper on the 20th of this month, which states that the business of the Beiyang Hengyuan two yarn factories is not thriving and it has been decided to sell them. This is inconsistent with the facts. Since our company took over, we have thoroughly reformed the machinery, architecture, and various equipment, and have strived to modernize them to achieve increased efficiency. The report in the telegram is inaccurate. We hope you will correct it.</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: When Chen Jitang and Li Zongren of Guangdong and Guangxi launched military operations, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Song Zheyuan jointly sent a telegram, which attracted much attention. At the beginning of this month, Han also sent Li Zhifan, Shandong Salt Transport Commissioner, as a representative to Beijing with a personal letter to meet with Chiang and Minister Kong to express Shandong's difficult situation and his advocacy for peace. Chiang and Kong replied with very sincere letters. Chiang's letter also expressed his hope that Han would work hard to support the precarious situation in North China. Because Chiang was concerned about Han's unhealed foot ailment, he specially sent Zhang Fang, commander of the 20th Route Army, to Jinan with a letter to visit Han. Zhang stayed in Jinan for several days and had very pleasant conversations. On the morning of the 23rd, Han sent Zhang Yue, a member of the Shandong Provincial Committee, and Tang Xiang, director of the Beijing Office, with a letter to Beijing to meet with Chiang. Zhang Fang also left Jinan that evening. This reporter visited Han early on the 24th to inquire about everything. Han said, "This time, Zhang Boying (Fang) came to Jinan, bringing Chairman Chiang's letter to me. The wording was extremely sincere, and I was very grateful after reading it. I have sent Zhang, a member of the committee (Yue), south with a letter to meet with Chiang. The general idea of the letter is nothing more than that I will always support Chairman Chiang, because I have always been favored by Chairman Chiang, and I greatly admire his great personality and the thoroughness of his national plans. Especially in the past seven or eight years, he has been extremely generous to Shandong, to the 3rd Route Army, and to me personally. I should support him for both public and private reasons. However, my knowledge is shallow, and I have no cultivation of qi, so I am sometimes inevitably impulsive and act without careful consideration. I hope Chairman Chiang will forgive me. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang is deeply aware of Shandong's difficult situation. I will not go to Qingdao or elsewhere recently, and I will pay attention to the Yellow River, hoping that it will not breach again." (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Zou and Song Arrive in Guangdong to Reorganize Finance; Zou Lin to First Return to Nanjing After Investigating the Situation; Song Ziliang Has Already Assumed the Post of Acting Director of the Finance Department; Guangdong's Foreign Exchange Declines, Central Government Bonds Rise <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In this political change in Guangdong, the former Director of the Finance Department, Ou Fangpu, has been dismissed along with Chen Jitang. Merchants and businessmen believe that the Guangdong affair has been settled, and the wholesale and retail of goods have returned to normal. The financial community is not as prone to manipulating Hong Kong exchange rates as it was a few days ago, so the value of the Hong Kong dollar has fallen from a premium of nine to a premium of six or seven. The newly appointed Director of the Finance Department, Song Ziliang, arrived in Guangzhou by plane at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Accompanying him were Zou Lin, a financial decision maker; Zhou Shouliang, deputy director of the Business Department of the Central Bank; Hao Chongguang of the Central Trust Bureau; financial experts Tang Shi and Dong Rending; and Wu Jiantao, the newly appointed Director of the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Unified Tax Bureau, totaling eleven people. When the Nanjing aircraft carrying Song, Zou, and others flew south, it flew over Shaoguan and landed in Shao to first meet with Yu Hanmou to discuss in detail the measures for reorganizing the finances of Guangdong Province. After three or four minutes, he took the original aircraft to Guangdong, and after getting off the aircraft, took a car to the city guesthouse to rest. Welcomers were immediately there where a tea party was held. Fan Zhanpeng of the Anti-Smuggling Office gave a welcome speech, and Zou Lin replied, saying that he was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to come to Guangdong to inspect the progress of Guangdong's financial reorganization. Then Song Ziliang gave a speech and dispersed. In the evening, Provincial Chairman Lin Yunhao hosted a banquet. On this day, Zou and Song made the following remarks: "Guangdong is the source of the revolution, and it is also an important coastal port. The development of foreign trade has a considerable position in the international arena. Therefore, the central government attaches more importance to Guangdong than any other place. For several years, there has been no opportunity to seek a complete reorganization. The government authorities have been distressed. Now that the Guangdong situation has been settled and the obstacles have been eliminated, everyone knows that there is no way to save the country and survive without unified political orders. This is the government's long-standing desire to seek welfare and cooperation for the people of Guangdong. It can be expected to be implemented. Finance and finance are the lifeline, and reorganization cannot be delayed. Minister Kong specially dispatched Lin as a representative to Guangdong to inspect, and at the same time, he accepted the decision of the Executive Yuan to appoint Ziliang as a special financial commissioner of Guangdong and concurrently as the director of the Finance Department. We originally planned to come by sea, but Minister Kong believed that the reputation bureau had just been settled, and the people's hearts were uneasy. It is not possible to make important officials Lu Xuan and important political affairs stalled. I hope that the arrangement in Guangdong will be properly settled, and my heart is extremely urgent, so I changed to a plane. When I first arrived in Guangdong, I should formulate an entire plan on how to organize the entire finance and finance. After a thorough investigation of the details, I will prepare a plan and submit it to the central or local government for approval and implementation, step by step. I hope that it will be beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood, and that it will not disappoint the expectations of the people of Guangdong." On the 23rd, Song had already assumed the post of Guangdong Financial Commissioner and concurrently acting Director of the Guangdong Finance Department. Zou Lin will first return to Beijing to report to Minister Kong after inspecting the financial situation in Guangdong Province and investigating finance. Also, Tang Haian took over as acting Salt Transport Commissioner on the afternoon of the 21st. During the day, he will find ways to reorganize salt affairs and save the past decline. Since Zou and Song arrived in the province, they have claimed to reorganize Guangdong's finances, so the general merchants and people deeply hope that the government bonds issued by the Central Government in Guangdong in the past will be reorganized. In recent days, the prices of the first and second phases of the Central Government bonds have risen to 37, the third phase of the Central Government bonds has risen to 34, and the National Defense bonds have risen to 30%. The ten-yuan central banknotes issued by the Central Bank in Guangdong suddenly rose from 40% to 70%. The financial market is very active in trading such bonds. (July 23rd)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: During this change in Guangdong, Huang Renhuan, the commander of the Fourth Army, moved his headquarters from Meixian to Laolong in Dongjiang, and united with the headquarters of the Third Army in Huiyang. The headquarters of the Fortieth Division were located in Fengshun City, and the headquarters of the Eleventh Division were located in Meixian City, leaving only a small number of troops in Meifeng. The Twelfth Division, Chen Hanguang's troops, had already been transferred back to Guangzhou in full. The order in various places is still good, but the coastal areas of Raoping are rampant with bandits. The leaders of the local communists are also recruiting and compiling various groups of bandits to carry out activities on a grand scale. Shantou City imposed special martial law on the 18th. Li Yukun, the director of the Eastern District Committee, summoned the heads of various departments to hold a meeting to establish a joint military and police supervisory office. The office was established on the 20th to maintain law and order. At 9:00 PM, martial law was enforced, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass near various agencies. It is heard that the reform of the political situation here will start with finance, and that there will be a strict ban on smoking and gambling, and that all kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes will be exempted. Therefore, tax officials from Mei, Jiao, Ping, Pu, and Rao counties are automatically ending their business in Shantou or returning to the province. The Anti-Smoking Bureau, the Defense Funding Company, etc., also have no military protection and have stopped collecting. Smuggling personnel were withdrawn on the 18th, and smuggled goods from outside poured in like a tide. The Agricultural Production Bureau also announced on the 21st that it would abolish the special tax on foreign rice. Tax officials with power in various counties took the opportunity to forcibly collect land taxes from the people. Some plundered the people's wealth and fled, and some ended their business without paying taxes. Some of the inspectors were majestic and overbearing, while others were crestfallen and downcast like homeless dogs. Shantou merchants dare not transport goods to Fujian for sale due to the unrest in the region. The families of bureaucrats are moving to Hong Kong and Macau one after another, which is a scene of unease in the transition between the old and the new.</p>

<p>The Marusan Pharmacy on Dama Road outside Changmen Gate is run by Japanese national Masaji Kaneketsu. It has been there for more than 20 years. At around 4:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, someone used a scale weight to smash a hole in the glass window at the door. At that time, the Japanese merchant reported the matter to the police and stated that he did not want to pursue it, so it was not investigated in depth. Unexpectedly, Japanese Consul-General Kawanishi Toyozō stationed in Suzhou sent an official letter to the county government yesterday to negotiate, requesting that the perpetrator be quickly arrested and severely punished. After receiving the letter, County Magistrate Deng, according to the previous information, immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest and bring the perpetrator to the county government for interrogation within one week.</p>

<p>He Runzhang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, believes that beggars begging in the city are a nuisance to the city's appearance, and that the number of beggars coming from outside has been increasing recently. Therefore, he and local figures and Zhou Xuewen, director of the Red Cross Society, negotiated to organize a beggar shelter in the Gushui Daoyuan. More than 40 male and female beggars have been captured, provided with meals, and taught skills so that they can support themselves. Yesterday, a male beggar named Wang Guirong, 17 years old, from Jiangbei, was diagnosed with fever, also known as ganglioma, which is quite serious. Director He believes that black fever is now prevalent in the Huai, Xu, and Hai areas and spreads quickly. It has not yet been discovered in this city. In order to avoid its spread, he has sent the sick beggar to the Shanghai Municipal Hospital for treatment to avoid future troubles.</p>

<p>The land tax in this county has always been collected by the East and West Land Tax Collection Offices of the county government. The heads of the two offices are both local residents, and because the collection procedures are complicated, experienced personnel are required, which has become a hereditary practice. Therefore, even with frequent changes of county magistrates, the heads of the two offices have never been replaced, leading to the proliferation of malpractices. Now, after assuming office, the county magistrate, in order to thoroughly rectify the situation, has specially recruited more than fifty accountants, and starting from the 15th of this month, they have begun to investigate the accumulated records of the two offices over the years. It is said that many malpractices have been discovered. For example, due to the preservation of collection records being incomplete and unclear regarding whether property owners have fully paid their debts, for a considerable portion of wealthy households, internal staff members undertake to handle the payments. For instance, if a payment of one thousand yuan is due, they first pay three hundred yuan, and the staff member is responsible for it. No receipt is issued, and no further collection is pursued. The funds are pocketed by the staff member, and this malpractice has persisted for a long time without ever being discovered. Currently, the county government will thoroughly rectify the situation, and some people propose that the names of the households with outstanding records should be formally announced to clarify the matter. It is believed that the amount of arrears owed by these officials is tens of times greater than that owed by the common people.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Plea for Postponement of Income Tax Collection <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Pang Diancai, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, due to the recent sluggish business of various merchants, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a temporary postponement of income tax collection. The original text was quite lengthy, and the main points raised four reasons: (1) Merchants are already paying business tax, and if they have to pay income tax as well, the combined tax rate would be too high; (2) Various exorbitant taxes such as production and sales donation, bandit suppression and rehabilitation donation, special tax, consumption tax, silk improvement tax, special tax, landing tax, slaughter tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, etc., have not been abolished. If income tax is implemented, these similar "likin" style policies should be completely abolished; (3) From an individual perspective, if a monthly salary is thirty yuan, it is not even enough to support a family, let alone have any surplus; (4) Income tax will inevitably not be extended to foreigners, so in the future, merchants in concessions may not be easily collected from, resulting in domestic savings and public bonds being deposited in foreign banks, promoting the escape of capital, and the hope of revival for industry and commerce will be forever lost.</p>

<p>Tong Lu's, the wife of Tong Degen, a resident behind Wenheng Bridge in the city, allowed Zhang Goulang, the 62-year-old nephew of Zhang Aliu who lived across the street, to stay in their home, but he was suddenly killed. After investigation by the county government, according to Tong Lu's, three or four days earlier, a person surnamed Jia from another province stated that he was unfavorable to Tong Lu's, and it is speculated that Zhang Goulang's murder might be related to this person. However, there are factual difficulties in this case, and the county government is seeking a way to extradite the person surnamed Jia from another province.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Jinan Railway Bureau: Purchasing the Boshan Light Railway, Purchase Price of 780,000 Already Approved by the Ministry of Railways <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The Boshan Light Railway is a major privately-operated coal transport route in the Liubo mining area. However, due to the excessively high freight rates and the inability to connect with the Zhangbo branch line of the Jiaoji Railway, the coal industry in eastern Shandong and the transportation revenue of the Jiaoji Railway have both been affected. The Boshan Light Railway, due to poor management, has been heavily indebted. Two years ago, there was already a proposal to sell it to the Jiaoji Railway. The Jiaoji Railway also eagerly wanted to purchase it due to the above-mentioned reasons. However, due to various reasons, the purchase issue was discussed and then discontinued. Recently, after negotiations between the provincial government and the Boshan Light Railway, it was agreed to purchase it for 780,000 yuan. Later, because the Ministry of Railways only agreed to pay 650,000 yuan, which was more than 100,000 yuan less than the original agreement, the issue almost stalled. Tu Wei-zeng, the chief of engineering of the Jiaoji Railway, was sent to Beijing to explain everything to the Ministry of Railways. The board of directors of the Boshan Light Railway convened a meeting of creditor groups in Jinan, submitted a request to the construction department to be forwarded to the provincial government, and informed the Jiaoji Railway that it agreed to sell it for 780,000 yuan. Now, the Ministry of Railways has sent a telegram to the Jiaoji Railway Administration, formally approving the purchase for 780,000 yuan. As for the method of appropriation, the Ministry of Railways will send personnel to Qingdao to handle it. Today (the 23rd), the Jiaoji Railway Administration has forwarded this telegram to Ge Guangting. Tonight (the 23rd), Ge has returned to Qingdao from Jinan. Once the personnel from the Ministry of Railways arrive, the payment can be made and the purchase realized. The issue of purchasing the Boshan Light Railway, which has been brewing for more than two years, has now been successfully concluded. (23rd)</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance on the 24th, appealing for exemption from income tax. The original telegram stated five points that are intricate, detailed, and difficult to implement. Based on the principle of not disturbing the people, it is necessary to exempt the tax. Please approve and implement it to alleviate the difficulties of the people and relieve the plight of merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Nantong: Negotiations on Japanese Fishing Boat Intrusion <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Ge Tan, the special commissioner of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, telegraphed the provincial government to promptly consult the Ministry and negotiate with the Japanese side regarding the intrusion of Japanese fishing boats into the Shengsi Islands and the destruction of our fishing industry. The telegram stated briefly: According to a telegraph from Gu Hongxi, the magistrate of Chongming County, on behalf of the district magistrate of the Fifth District, Ling Pengcheng, the case of fishing boats anchored in Sijiao being destroyed by Japanese fishing boats has been reported by the district magistrate in a telegraph, and has been submitted to the Ministry and provincial government for rescue and negotiation. Now, fishermen Wang Ade and others have managed to borrow nets and other equipment and go out to fish again, hoping for a final struggle to make a living. Unexpectedly, they were again destroyed by dozens of unknown Japanese fishing boats and the domestic hand-operated net fishing boats, De Tai No. 1 and No. 2, which completely dragged away 131 tiers of nets from the 16 households. Their livelihood is now completely cut off, and they must also compensate for the borrowed nets, selling everything to make ends meet. They plead to be telegraphed to the upper levels for rescue. It is investigated that the people have previously suffered significant losses, and now they have been devastated again. The district authorities have witnessed the situation and believe that their livelihoods have been cut off. In addition to instructing local wealthy households to provide assistance to temporarily alleviate hunger, it is appropriate to telegraph the request for transfer to the investigation and joint negotiations. As for the domestic fishing boats De Tai No. 1 and No. 2, they are conscienceless and harm their own kind, and it is requested to investigate and prosecute them according to the law. Based on this, it is investigated that the district magistrate previously reported that Japanese fishing boats had crossed the border to intrude and drag away fishing nets, and the case has been reported. According to the telegram, in addition to instructions, it is appropriate to telegraph the request for joint review.</p>

<p>The home of Yan Yulou, the head of the ninth bao and sixth jia of Jufeng Township, the seventh district under the county, which is close to Taixian County, was suddenly invaded by many bandits with firearms the other night. They rushed inside, intimidated Yulou, his son Yongxin, and the hired workers, and detained them in a room to rob them. Fortunately, his daughter-in-law, Xie, took the opportunity to climb onto the roof and escape to call for help. The neighbors heard the alarm and started ringing gongs. Yan Ruzhen and Yan Buhai, the heads of the fifth and sixth jia of the bao, were seriously injured while resisting the bandits. Later, the neighboring villages also heard the alarm and burned straw piles and fired shots to show their strength, which frightened the bandits and dispersed them. After the incident, an investigation revealed that the Yan family only lost the bao chief's official seal and some miscellaneous items.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Hangzhou: Five Major Agricultural Warehouses Handle Loans for Goods <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>In order to concentrate agricultural products and circulate the rural economy, the Zhejiang Construction Department decided to establish an agricultural warehouse management committee. This has been approved by the provincial government. The heads of the Department of Civil Affairs, Department of Finance, and Department of Construction are ex officio members, and Wu Jianyang is the chairman of the committee. Yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, the three department heads held a meeting and decided to appoint six members, who have also been internally determined. The five major agricultural warehouses must determine the warehouse locations and business scope and begin construction in early next month. The system will be fully public-owned and privately-operated, handling loans for agricultural warehouse goods. Because the early rice season is too late, it will definitely be able to start during the late rice harvest.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Ningbo: Sand Boat Hits Reef, Many Killed <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Jinxinsheng sand boat, with a very large capacity, was owned by boat owner Ding Zhicheng, who hired 15 crew members including Xu Asheng, Shen Chunsheng, Lu Baocheng, Xu Linsheng, and Lu Dalai. Ding Zhicheng had a concubine, He, and a four-year-old son, Bogao, who resided in Xiamen. On the 21st, the boat carried 1,245 bags of brown sugar from Xiamen, worth more than 30,000 yuan. The cargo owner gave a deadline of five days to transport the sugar to Yongbo. Therefore, after leaving the harbor of Xiamen, the boat sailed day and night without stopping. At about 3:00 PM on the 23rd, the boat sailed through the Yushan waters of the Zhejiang Sea, and suddenly encountered a hidden reef, which broke the hull. Because they only knew that the front cargo hold had been breached, they rushed to repair it, causing the breach in the rear cargo hold to burst open. Sea water poured in and could not be blocked. The boat sank in an instant. At that time, there was a strong wind and rain, and there were no boats on the sea. There was no one to call for help. Only three crew members, Xu Asheng, Shen Chunsheng, and Lu Baocheng, were rescued by a fishing boat after floating in the water for two hours. The remaining 15 people, including Ding Zhicheng, were buried in the belly of the fish. It was a truly tragic disaster. Hu Dingren, the magistrate of Xiangshan County, secretary Zhu Wenbo, the third section chief Guo Yaohou, and gentry Feng Yixin, Kong Xianbin, and Zhang Zaixi, etc., were reported to the Fujian-Zhejiang supervisory commissioner for punishment due to the opium suppression case and the appropriation of artificial silk bonuses for the Damaitang ticket purchase. The commissioner specially dispatched Chen to Xiangshan a few days ago to thoroughly investigate the truth, inquire about the truth from all parties involved and relevant parties, and returned to the province to report after inspecting the case files in the county.

<h3 id="e96">Xiaoshan: Four Children Drown While Swimming <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>In Jinjishan near Sheqian in the southern countryside of Xiaoshan, the mountains are green and the water is clear. Every summer, there are many people swimming and bathing all day long. On the morning of the 25th of this month, four children surnamed Li and Fang were learning to swim in a stream in the area. Unexpectedly, because the stream water flowed down from top to bottom, plunging straight down, the children did not know how to swim. They jumped in, went from shallow to deep, and drifted away with the current. It was not until the afternoon that the families looked for the children and went to the area to check. They only saw four sets of clothes. By 4:00 PM, the bodies had not surfaced.</p>

<p>Since Gaoliang in the county became restless, Xu Guilin, the bandit leader from Guanyun, gathered more than 30 followers and occupied Huahou Township in the first district of Guanyun. The township has the former and latter villages of Xu Shanglin. After the bandits occupied the former village, the latter village learned of it, and Jia Jie led the villagers to besiege the former village on the night of the 18th. The bandits resisted in the village, and the two sides fought fiercely for two hours. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure, looted the former village, set fire to the houses, and took advantage of the smoke to break through the encirclement. The bandits killed Zheng Zhusan and Feng Bixian in the village. By the time the township chief mobilized the sentry team, the bandits had already fled far away. The aftermath of the former village is now being handled, and the losses are considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Anecdotes from the Southern Tour: Special Correspondent Shi Ying of This Newspaper - Forced Education in Jiangshan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The people of Jiangshan are tough, and the gentry are divided into factions. Every county magistrate who comes here feels a headache. In the past, only two county magistrates earned a good reputation: one was called Chen Dingxin, because he was fair and honest. He knew that the common people could not squeeze water out of dry firewood, so he truly donated his official salary to subsidize the mandatory and miscellaneous items sent down from above. The other was called Wu Yimin, who was bold and courageous. When he encountered difficult theft cases, he dared to disguise himself and capture the robbers. Naturally, this is not enough to call them upright officials of a prosperous age, but what day is it today? What's more, Jiangshan is a place where the people are poor and there are many bandits. It is no wonder that the common people praise and remember these two county magistrates who "do not love money" and "are not afraid of death."</p>
<p>The current county magistrate, Zhou Xinwan, has served for four or five consecutive terms. Of course, he has achieved considerable political achievements. Otherwise, how could he have done it? It is said that Zhou County Magistrate suffered a loss of more than 30,000 yuan in savings when Cuifeng Zhuang in Qu County went bankrupt, and his request for reimbursement from the provincial government was rejected. However, according to the idle talk of several gentry, being a county magistrate also has its hardships.</p>
<p>Later, the reporter went to visit him, and he talked about several valuable political views:</p>
<p>He said: "First, the current county administration is not worried about the lack of plans, but is actually worried about too many plans. Sometimes, the superiors issue too many government orders that they cannot even remember themselves, and then issue new orders that change the method or contradict the previous ones. As a result, what has been done below loses credibility with the people, and what has not been done is lucky to please. There are even government orders that have good motives, but the result is a policy that harms the people. For example, labor service, digging soil and building roads, five amateurish and weak people are often not as good as an experienced laborer. Even if the government does not pay, the people are not all idle class, and going to work is equivalent to spending money. Second, the increase in the duties of the Bao chief also has more disadvantages than advantages. For example, fighting bandits, allocating funds, grain for soldiers, training militia, and soliciting donations for airplanes are five major events that the county government is worried about not being able to do, and are completely pushed on the Bao chief. The mission of a Bao chief has become a microcosm of the county government's authority. As a result, the fault is that there is no movement when there should be movement, or no movement at all. Third, many financial institutions that help the countryside, such as bank loans and cooperative organizations, are not purely launched from an objective perspective, but from a subjective perspective. To be specific, few banks that arrive are not absorbed by it to deposit funds and manipulate market prices. Mr. Chen Lifu once said: 'Banks are the enemy of the countryside.' The financial community, which hopes to use the good name of helping the countryside to achieve profit-making purposes, should deeply reflect on this." This conversation, rich in experienced meaning, is revealed frankly. A virtuous and capable county magistrate should not be offended, right?</p>
<p>The Inter-Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the four provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian also stands in this small city, which is also known as "Jade Leaf." The commander-in-chief is Zhang Fakui, the commander of the Fourth Army, known as the "Iron Army" in the Northern Expedition era. During the tense January 28th Shanghai Incident, many people and public opinion longed for this "Iron General" to descend from the sky and show his skills. At this time, mentioning the name Zhang Fakui, readers probably feel somewhat familiar. This time, when the reporter went to visit him, he talked a lot about the national crisis and current affairs in a passionate and excited manner, but he also instructed us not to publish it for the time being. But readers do not need to be disappointed. His secretary, the chief of the secretariat, Wang Kuiyi, and other gentlemen, unintentionally talked about Zhang's interesting stories during his European tour, which is a good alternative dessert:</p>
<p>On the train to Germany, a German with deep eyes and a high nose saw him dressed elegantly and acting dignified, and gave him a thumbs up to congratulate him, saying: "Admire! Admire! Your country's military strength is really strong. It won't be long before you occupy half of China!" Zhang knew that the man had mistaken him for a Japanese and was filled with shame and indignation. But the man still rambled on. Zhang had not yet reached his destination and had to sacrifice his plan and get off the train first. Later, when he arrived in Berlin, he wanted to visit a factory and hired a famous teacher to teach him German at a price of eighty marks per hour. When Zhang filled out the resume form, he did not directly fill in "soldier" but pretended to be a history teacher. Unexpectedly, the teacher looked at the resume during the first class and suddenly asked him as if he had found something: "Japan is constantly invading China. China has six or seven times the population and dozens of times the land of Japan. Why doesn't it resist? Since you are a history teacher, please tell me: What is the Chinese national character?" This is another difficult question that he still cannot forget. Readers, how does this dessert taste?</p>
<p>The headquarters leads the local government to promote local construction, improve customs, and implement compulsory education as much as possible. The South Main Street in the city is lined with shops and is the most prosperous area in the city, but the street is so narrow that it "can be" narrow. Moreover, during labor service, the newly built "strip" and "cattle" roads are often secretly discussed by the common people, saying that they wear out a few more pairs of shoes than the old roads. Every time at dusk, shop assistants set up seats along the street and fan themselves to enjoy the cool air. Not only do passers-by have difficulty passing each other face to face, but the sweaty air that fills the street seems to have nowhere to evaporate. Now the headquarters has ordered the demolition of houses to widen the road and applied to the provincial government for a subsidy of 6,000 yuan (which has been agreed upon but not yet received) to be used for repairing the road surface. Although this matter is inevitably difficult in action, the result can make transportation convenient, improve the city's appearance, and prosper commerce. Therefore, it has begun to be actively carried out, and it is expected that the entire road will be completed after autumn.</p>
<p>Jiangshan is located in a remote corner, and the people mostly adhere to outdated customs, especially when holding funerals, they pay attention to what "Seven Sevens" means. That is, the "First Seven" opens the mourning hall, and relatives and friends come to offer condolences without end. The "Second Seven" makes sacrifices and recites scriptures. The "Third Seven" says that the deceased begins to know that he is dead, and the bereaved family must kneel in the courtyard and cry all night to show filial piety. "Fifth Seven" relatives and friends offer sacrifices and set up a banquet to entertain guests, and prepare for the funeral on the "Seventh Seven" to be considered over. But which year and which direction is auspicious? When will it actually be carried out? These are all problems. According to the investigation, there are as many as three hundred coffins parked in the city, which is a danger to the health of the entire city of more than nine thousand people! Now the headquarters has issued a notice, ordering the funeral to be carried out and stipulating that the mourning period should not exceed "One Seven" in the future. In the past few days when the deadline is approaching, you can almost always hear the sound of trumpets and firecrackers, which are all mourning music to clear out this large number of dead people. However, there are still people who want to change the "One Seven" mourning period to "Three Seven." It is hoped that local people will provide guidance in various ways, because this excessively superstitious and uneconomical and unsanitary funeral should indeed be taken advantage of to improve it once and for all. This is not only the luck of the bereaved family, but also the luck of the local area.</p>
<p>In China at the present stage, implementing compulsory education is often criticized, and it is considered a fantasy and impossible education method. Because China's educational tradition has always adopted a laissez-faire and liberal approach, if it suddenly changes to an interventionist and restrictive approach, then the national situation may present a state of anxiety and uneasiness. At the same time, most of the general public are struggling with hunger and poverty. There is no time to seek knowledge. There are also problems such as teachers and teaching materials, which are strong obstacles in the objective environment. However, Mr. Zhang Fakui launched a compulsory education movement in the 52 counties of the four provincial border areas under his jurisdiction under the circumstances where these difficulties have not decreased.</p>
<p>After Zhang made up his mind, he issued a compulsory education order in the name of the commander-in-chief and designated Jiangshan, the county where he was stationed, as an experimental county, and Chenxiang Town as a pilot area. He set a deadline to eliminate all illiteracy in the entire area. He organized a compulsory education implementation committee and cadres, opened 18 simple literacy schools, and divided more than 1,200 illiterate people in the town into teams and loaded them into these 18 train carriages. The engine turned, the compulsory train started, and it followed the rails on time and achieved the door of success. On the day of the graduation ceremony, the reporter also went to participate. I saw those students from teenagers to forty or fifty years old, most of whom were barefoot and wore straw sandals. The students with the best grades received prizes such as watches and ink boxes, and the rest received at least letter paper and diplomas. Not to mention that they were all happy, even the reporter was extremely happy!</p>

<h3 id="e99">Minister Kong Talks About the Financial Situation in Guangdong Province - Expected to Return to Normal Soon - Has Telegraphed Zou, Song, Tang, and Gu to Consider the People's Livelihood and Eliminate Exorbitant Taxes, Miscellaneous Levies, and Illegal Salt Surcharges as Much as Possible - Denies That an Important Military and Political Conference Will Be Held in Lushan <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports: Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, originally planned to leave Shanghai for Beijing the night before last and then go to Lushan. However, due to the heavy financial burden and the slight damage to the patrol ship he planned to take, he postponed his departure until last night and took the overnight express train to Beijing and then to Lushan. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency paid a visit to Finance Minister Kong at his private residence on Simus Road last night and inquired about everything. Kong received him and said that Song Ziliang, the special commissioner of Guangdong's finance and director of the finance department, had arrived in Guangdong to take office and had sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance. It is expected that the financial situation in Guangdong Province will soon return to normal after Zou, the vice minister, and Song, the special commissioner, have reorganized it. It is investigated that over the years, Guangdong Province has levied many exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, causing great suffering to the people of Guangdong. Because they are under tyranny, they have no way to appeal. Therefore, I (Kong) have telegraphed Zou and Song, asking them to consider the people's livelihood and eliminate exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies that are harmful to society as much as possible. At the same time, I have also telegraphed Tang, the salt transport commissioner (Hai'an), to also eliminate illegal salt surcharges in order to relieve the people's plight. Liu Jiwen, the mayor of Guangzhou, came north a few days ago. I have already met with him. He came because no one could maintain local order in Guangzhou after Chen Jitang left. Therefore, I telegraphed Hong Kong and asked Chairman Lin (Yunhai) and Liu to hurry back to the province. After they arrived in the province, Lin immediately sent him to the north as a representative of the provincial government to report on the local situation. According to him, the people of Guangdong Province feel very grateful for the central government's settlement of the Guangdong incident and its peaceful handling, which did not cause any harm to the people. Therefore, they extremely support the central military and political authorities. Local order is also gradually recovering. However, they hope that Director Yu (Hanmou) will come to Guangzhou as soon as possible so that everything can be presided over. He knows that Yu has arrived in the province after arriving in Shanghai. The people's hearts will become more stable. Regarding the fact that the central military and political officials are going to Lushan this time, it is entirely for the purpose of working in another place. It is common practice for administrative leaders in various countries around the world to work in another place during the hot summer months. The reason is that the weather is hot and everyone's energy is inevitably a little less. Those who bear important responsibilities and have busy duties must find ways to remedy this. Therefore, the climate in the capital is hot, and various countries invariably work in another place. This time, the central colleagues accompanied Chairman Lin and President Jiang to Gu, which is actually an example of international practice. Outsiders who do not understand this say that the central officials are going to Lushan to escape the heat, which is actually a misrepresentation. As for those who do not know the truth and spread rumors that the central government will hold an important military and political conference in Lushan, it is even more absurd. If the central government needs to convene a conference, it can gather anytime, anywhere. Why go to Lushan to create this rumor? If it is not with ulterior motives, it is because they do not understand the truth.</p>

In order to increase the export of domestic products, Mr. Wang decided to consult with the authorities of the two countries after taking office to improve the liaison methods of commercial relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jin: The Ambassador to the Netherlands, Mr. Jin Wensi, returned to China this time to report on his work, with a three-month vacation, which has expired. Ambassador Jin originally intended to return to his post at the beginning of this month, but has not been able to do so because his domestic public and private affairs have not been completed. According to news from Ambassador Jin's residence in this port, Ambassador Jin is now scheduled to return to his post with his family at the end of August or the beginning of September. Since his departure is imminent, he has gone to Beijing a few days ago to pay a visit to Foreign Minister Zhang to ask for instructions on everything.</p>

<h3 id="e105">National Products Factory Association; Submitting a List of Restrictions on Tax Exemption Methods <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent smuggling, the National Products Factory Association of this city sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, and submitted seven items of methods to restrict the exchange of cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth export tax exemption permits. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Two Ministries</p>
<p>The association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, saying, "Presenting a list of methods to restrict the exchange of cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth export tax exemption permits, requesting approval and adoption, ordering the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau to issue a notice for implementation, in order to prevent smuggling and maintain the national cloth industry. It is the proposal of Zhou Shixuan, representative of the Qin Gong Sheng Ji Dyeing and Weaving Factory at the 10th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Association, to submit a list of methods to restrict the exchange of cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth exports, in order to use tax exemption permits to prevent smuggling. After notifying the relevant factories to submit opinions and referring to the actual situation, seven items of methods were drafted and submitted to the 11th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees on July 3 for deliberation, requesting the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to adopt and implement them, etc." The methods to restrict the exchange of cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth export permits have been drafted and submitted for approval. It is hoped that your ministry will investigate and verify, and give approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Seven Items of Methods</p>
<p>(1) All cotton spinning and dyeing factories, pure dyeing factories, pure cloth factories, and cloth shops that are capitalized and operated within the Shanghai city area shall re-register in accordance with the registration methods of each factory and cloth shop notified by the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau in order to enjoy the benefit of exchanging cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth exports and tax exemption permits. All unregistered factories and shops shall not be allowed to exchange cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth export tax exemption permits, in order to prevent smuggling. (2) When weaving factories apply for registration, they shall separately indicate the actual number of electric looms and wooden looms, and the number of cloth that each loom can produce per day (for example, if each loom operates day and night, it can produce about four bolts of 30-yard cloth. If the whole factory has 100 looms, it can produce 12,000 bolts of cloth per month. This is based on electric looms. The output of wooden looms is half of that. By analogy, the number should be increased or decreased). According to the actual output of the factory, it shall be allowed to exchange an equal amount of cotton yarn tax bills for cotton cloth export tax exemption permits, in order to facilitate the promotion of national cloth. (3) Pure dyeing factories and cloth shops have no weaving machines at all. The grey cloth used by dyeing factories and the cloth purchased by cloth shops must be purchased from spinning factories or pure weaving factories. The grey cloth or any cloth purchased by the factory or shop shall be registered with the original yarn tax bill and the invoice from the weaving factory to the competent Unified Tax Bureau (the registration form shall be issued by the Unified Tax Bureau). Once the cloth is loaded for export, the original registration form, the shipping mark, and the original yarn tax bill shall be checked for consistency before being allowed to exchange for cotton cloth export tax exemption permits and transported in accordance with the regulations. However, the quantity of cloth sold varies, and it shall be allowed to transport in batches with a single invoice, with the number of bolts noted each time and stamped by the Unified Tax Bureau until the shipment is completed. (4) The Unified Tax Bureau shall prepare an investigation form to investigate and register the names and quantities of existing cloths in pure weaving factories, pure dyeing factories, and cloth shops. If they have already obtained cloth export permits, it shall be verified whether the quantity of cloth prepared for export is consistent. Each factory and shop shall not purchase surplus cotton yarn tax bills on the market to fraudulently exchange for cloth export permits and tax exemption permits. If any fraudulent activities are found, they shall be punished in accordance with the anti-smuggling regulations. (5) The Unified Tax Bureau shall crack down on the fraudulent activities of counterfeit factories. In this city, weaving factories often falsely hang up a signboard of a certain weaving factory, and their purpose is to purchase cloth export tax exemption permits in the market in the name of the weaving factory to smuggle and commit fraud. All such counterfeit factories are responsible. If there are two or more signboards in one factory, the production of Factory A and Factory B shall be investigated. If the weaving machine production is inconsistent with the account book, it shall be deemed as fraudulently obtaining permits, smuggling, and committing fraud, and shall be severely punished as a warning to others. (6) If inland weaving factories have wholesale outlets in Shanghai, they shall present the cotton cloth export tax exemption permits issued by the competent Unified Tax Office to the Shanghai Unified Tax Bureau for verification and stamping before the goods can be transported. (7) Pure weaving factories shall not exchange export tax permits for more than the production quantity of the factory's weaving machines each month. Dyeing factories and cloth shops shall not exceed the cloth registered with the bureau in the registration form, in order to prevent smuggling.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Industry and various banks jointly prepared to establish the Agricultural Capital Bureau with a total of 60 million yuan in fixed and joint funds. After the government allocated funds and the banks jointly determined the amount, the banks formed an agricultural loan banking syndicate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Established in August</p>
<p>The Agricultural Capital Bureau is ready for establishment and is scheduled to be established in August.

Now, the banks have decided to hold a meeting this week to elect them. It is heard that Wu Dingchang will be recommended as the chairman of the board, and Zou Bingwen will be the general manager.</p>
<p>Forming Agricultural Loan Syndicate</p>
<p>A fixed capital of 30 million yuan will be allocated by the government in five years starting from this year. A joint fund of 30 million yuan will be jointly paid by the banks in five years starting from this year. Regarding working capital, according to Article 4 of the Articles of Association, "The agricultural loan syndicate organized by the participating banks shall agree with the Agricultural Capital Bureau on the amount at the beginning of each year." Now, Zou Bingwen, the general manager of the Shanghai Bank, and Qian Xinzhi, the general manager of the Four Banks Savings Association, are responsible for contacting the banks, and have obtained the approval of the banks. The number of working capital and detailed methods are being negotiated. It will be announced after the Agricultural Capital Bureau opens for business.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Dredging and Excavation of the Shentan in the Huangpu River; Recent Project; Limited Time to Complete Preliminary Completion; 800,000 Yuan of Mud and Sand Has Been Excavated <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau ordered the world's largest dredger, the Jianshe, from Germany. After arriving in Shanghai in April last year, it sailed to Shentan (also known as Tonghe Shansha) outside the Wusongkou to start dredging. This dredging project has been going on for a year. The recent progress of the project is recorded below:</p>
<p>Shentan Dredging</p>
<p>The Jianshe dredger is the world's latest trailing suction type. It can continue to operate while dredging without anchoring, so its work efficiency is extremely high. The amount of soil recently dredged from the dredging area is about 80 million cubic meters (4 tons per cubic meter). The work is still limited to daytime. Plans are now being made to add night shifts. However, the dredging area is on the proper waterway, and there is frequent traffic of ships, so it is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Adding New Ships</p>
<p>The bureau plans to complete the preliminary dredging of Shentan in five years. The dredgers are set at two, so the construction of the second one began on March 18 this year. However, in order to take into account the round-trip time for bids from foreign shipping companies, there must be sufficient time, so it has not yet been determined which country's shipping company will undertake the construction. The dredger will still be of the trailing suction type, but the hull will be larger than the Jianshe. It is expected to be completed in a year and a half.</p>
<p>Construction Model</p>
<p>The Jianshe dredger of the bureau was ordered from the German Schichau Shipyard and represented by the Siemens Foreign Company in this port. Before the ship was completed, Schichau Company first built a model of the ship, which was very exquisite, and handed it over to Siemens Foreign Company for display. Now that the Jianshe ship has been working for more than a year and the use is satisfactory, the acceptance procedures have been officially completed, so the ship model has been sent by Siemens Foreign Company to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau for display.</p>

<p>The U.S. Consul General's Office in Shanghai recently received a telegram from the United States stating that all leather goods shipped from China to various parts of the United States, whether shipped by mail or by other means, or originally shipped to one port and then transshipped to another port in the United States, must henceforth clearly write the name and address of the shipper and the consignee, and the number and type of all items in the package on the outside of the package in accordance with the regulations passed by the 74th Congress.</p>
<h3 id="e110">This Year's Tea Export Volume Has Increased Sharply; The Value Increased by 30,000 Metric Tons in June Alone Compared to Last Year; European Merchants Observe That There Is Hope for the Revival of Chinese Tea <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, this year's tea trade with foreign countries has undergone major reforms in quality and sales, and the selling price has doubled, and exports are strong, and the situation is quite auspicious for the revival. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Doubled in the Past</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in June, Shanghai's tea exports were 39,607.13 metric tons of green tea, 12,908.77 metric tons of black tea, and 1,880.47 metric tons of other tea, totaling 54,396.37 metric tons, an increase of about 30,000 metric tons compared to the same month last year, and an increase of more than 49,000 metric tons compared to May of this year. The purchasers were the United States, France, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Morocco, and other countries. Green tea accounted for the largest share of exports, and black tea accounted for only two-fifths of green tea, because the demand for black tea is not as widespread as that for green tea.</p>
<p>The Market Is Still Thriving</p>
<p>This year, tea exports have increased, and the selling price is better than last year. Since the market opened, the market price of various high-end box teas, except for inferior goods, has been between 60 and 70 yuan. This month, tea merchants from Britain, France, Russia, and the United States in Shanghai still have a great need for it, such as Pingshui Xiushui and Shrimp Eyes, with thousands of boxes traded every day, especially Pingshui green tea, which sells the best. Although the arrival of goods is eagerly awaited, there is still a situation of supply falling short of demand, so the foreign sales situation is still very prosperous.</p>
<p>Reasons for Improvement</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the sudden improvement in foreign sales, according to what the reporter of Xin Xin News Agency learned from inquiries, it can be divided into three points: (1) Since China has been developing tea on its own, in addition to implementing centralized sales, the National Economic Council and tea merchants in Anhui and Jiangxi have jointly run experimental fields to promote scientific roasting methods, and the quality has been improved day by day, surpassing Indian and Ceylon tea; (2) Although Britain, Russia, the United States, France, and other countries have advocated tea planting, it is difficult to achieve results due to unsuitable land; (3) The production of tea in India, Java, Ceylon, and other countries that compete with Chinese tea in the international market has decreased sharply in recent years, and Chinese tea has taken advantage of the shortage, so European tea merchants in general observe that if Chinese tea can work hard to reform and not slack off, it can be expected to dominate the international tea market in a few years.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the illegal seizure of refined salt by the Hangzhou Salt Police has aroused public outrage among Zhejiang people in Shanghai. According to news from various sources, the incident has a tendency to escalate. In addition to the victim filing a criminal self-accusation with the Zixiang Court and publishing an appeal to all sectors to uphold justice, it is heard that Li Biekui and Sun Mingqi, Zhejiang fellow-provincials in Shanghai, have jointly sent a letter to the Zhejiang General Association, requesting assistance. The original letter is found as follows: (Omitted above) After investigating, refined salt has long been specially permitted by the government to be sold, and except for the restriction on the sales area, people in the mainland are absolutely allowed to purchase and eat it freely. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly emphasized this, and the former Daliyuan's Shangzi No. 1655 and 1656 in the 13th year also have precedents to say. According to the General Rules for Refined Salt promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in January of the 20th year, there is no provision prohibiting people in the mainland from purchasing and eating it. Moreover, salt is a daily necessity, and Jiuda refined salt is an official salt specially permitted for sale after paying national taxes. How can it be forbidden for people in the north to purchase and eat it? If this is not punished, not only will the people of Zhejiang have the risk of eating blandly, but the arrogant and illegal behavior of the salt police will also be brutally destroyed in the personal freedom of the people. Therefore, a special letter is sent to you, hoping that you will send a letter to the Zhejiang salt administration to express your protest and make an effective claim in the case. This matter concerns the public interests of our hometown and the food for the people's livelihood. Your association is always happy to accept it. To the Zhejiang General Association.</p>

The association is now expanding publicity. In addition to daily parades and publicity, it will open movie showings to add to the interest of guests. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Flourishing Business</p>
<p>Because the association is located in the center of the North District of Shanghai, with a magnificent facade, tens of thousands of nearby residents come to visit every day, and foreign guests must also enter the venue for a week-long tour. The men and women of the eastern neighbors all hold hands in the venue to see the scenery of our country's national products. The business of the manufacturers throughout the venue is also thriving because of this. According to the report of the association's statistics department, the turnover of the entire venue has reached more than 100,000 yuan. Therefore, this national product exhibition has actually formed an international exhibition due to its excellent location.</p>
<p>Expanded Publicity</p>
<p>It is learned that the association has decided to send personnel to parade and publicize every day to attract the attention of the people in the district to national products and increase their interest in using national products.

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, since being ordered to temporarily suspend the development of drafts between Shanghai and Guangxi, the postal remittance situation between Shanghai and Guangxi has tended to stagnate. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency inquiring from the Administration, the Administration was again ordered yesterday to immediately restore the exchange between Shanghai and Guangxi. However, yesterday was Sunday, and the domestic exchange office was closed as usual. Therefore, from this morning, the development of drafts between Shanghai and Guangxi can be resumed, and exchange can be carried out as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shanghai-Wuxi Automobile Company; Reducing Gasoline Consumption; Achievements of Retrofitting Charcoal Furnaces <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Automobile Company has been open to traffic for almost a year since August 15 last year. Yesterday, the reporter met Mr. Jiang Yuren, the director of the general affairs department of the company, to inquire about the recent situation of the company. According to his talk, the company's business situation in the past year is currently being counted, and it is generally quite good. The company's only plan at present is to reduce the consumption of gasoline in order to increase net profit. The important step of this plan is to adopt charcoal and diesel vehicles. The company had previously decided to retrofit all vehicles with charcoal-for-oil furnaces by Zhongming Factory. Twenty-eight vehicles have now been installed, and the test results in the past six months are very good, no different from those using gasoline, and the consumption is saved a lot. However, due to the insufficient availability of vehicles, the installation can only be carried out gradually. In addition, the company has eight diesel vehicles, which were originally purchased for freight transportation. Because there is still little freight transportation at present, they have been converted into passenger cars, and the oil consumption is also quite economical. However, the cost of the car body is huge and more will be placed. At present, the company's daily vehicles give priority to charcoal cars, followed by diesel cars, and the use of gasoline cars is decreasing day by day, and detailed numerical comparisons of these three different fuels are being made, which will be completed soon to contribute to the reference for adoption by various highways.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Songjiang Salt Production Workers' Union; Letter to Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association; Yuanpu Salt Field Limited Quota for Salt Payment; Please Forward to Revoke the Order <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association received a letter from the Songjiang County Salt Production Industry Union yesterday, saying: Sir, according to reports from hundreds of members of our association, such as Wang Dingxiang, Mao Zhongfu, and Zhang Xiaohuai, because they recently saw Notice No. 69 issued by the Yuanpu Salt Field Office, it stated: "According to Order No. 6345 of June 1 of this year from the Songjiang Salt Affairs Audit Sub-Office, after translation, it is found that the salt production by the board households in the Songjiang District is based on the voluntary application of the board households for a special permit for salt production and drying, without any coercion from the public. The board households voluntarily and conscientiously abide by the salt production regulations and pay at least 317.5 market catties of salt per board every year as stipulated by the Salt Affairs Department. If the salt paid is less than the fixed quota by the end of this year, a fine shall be imposed (the shortage of salt money shall be paid at the price of 2.7 cents per dan of salt in the storehouse), or their special permit shall be revoked, the salt board shall be broken, and no excuses of poverty shall be used to hope for exemption from the fine. In addition, the households that have not paid granules from January to April this year shall be strictly ordered to find a corresponding guarantee, and the salt shall be paid in full thereafter, otherwise their special permit shall be revoked, the salt board shall be broken, and no leniency shall be given. We should comply with this order, etc." Upon receiving this order, the salt farmers in the entire field were in an uproar and panic. It is necessary to know that the leniency and severity of legislation must be adapted to human feelings. The salt production situation in the Songjiang Field is not fully understood by the superiors. Now we will carefully present it as follows: (omitted) Such notices that are out of reason and emotion, the salt farmers absolutely dare not obey, and request to forward to the superiors to revoke the order, and must not deceive and conceal, and weep and plead, and wait quietly for a clear order, etc. Based on this, after our association verified that the statements made by the members are all true, it is the key point of salt production, which depends entirely on sunlight, tides, and manpower. Although the payment quota has been stipulated, the output is still difficult to predict. The salt production is produced by nature, and cannot be manufactured by machines, so it can be expedited. The life of the salt farmers is unspeakably bitter, and it is difficult to make ends meet all year round. We hope that the weather will be clear for a long time in the second half of the year, and the tides will be greater, so that the previous losses can be made up. If the weather is bad again, not only will it be difficult to pay the quota, but the livelihood of the salt farmers will be impossible to solve. Where will this fine come from? If they must revoke the permit and break the salt board to cut off the livelihood of the salt farmers, the salt farmers are at the critical moment of life and death. Indeed, I am afraid that an incident will be caused. Our association advises the salt farmers to pay as much as they can. We also found that there are many members of your association who rely on salt production for a living in Songjiang. In addition to presenting to the salt administration authorities, we have specially written to your association to uphold justice, hoping that you will forward it to the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy to order the Yuanpu Salt Field to revoke the order to relieve the salt farmers' suffering and maintain their livelihood. This is a true public friendship."</p>

General Director Li Dachao, Director Zhang Yuliang and 14 other people attended the meeting. Chairman Li Dachao, Recorder Chen Yan, Chairman's report, briefly said that this association initiated fundraising to purchase airplanes to celebrate birthdays, and all parties enthusiastically supported it as an expansion of the national aviation salvation movement and love for the leader. All circles and groups in this city are willing to enthusiastically contribute. The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai is also one of the initiators of this association. At the beginning of this move, it was decided to distribute donation booklets to encourage donations from fellow villagers and make every effort. Mr. Lin Bingyan alone donated 10,000 yuan, which I received yesterday and paid to the association. The donation amount has exceeded 10,800 yuan, and thank you letters have been sent respectively. It is reported that it is still being promoted, and the results can reach tens of thousands of yuan. The miscellaneous grain, oil, and cake industry donated 100,000 yuan from the collection of goods to purchase an airplane. The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association organized a fundraising team and pledged to donate 100,000 yuan. Both are working hard. This association wants to complete its mission as soon as possible, and has sent personnel to assist in handling it separately. Other organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Federation of Trade Unions, and Bankers Association are also working hard to promote it. As for entertainment venues, this association has sent letters requesting a fixed day to use the business income to make donations. Various theaters, movie theaters, amusement parks, and dance halls have held activities one after another, and the results are still good. Venues that have not yet held activities are in contact and will be held on a fixed date, so that they can be concluded as soon as possible. In addition, the collection of aviation salvation funds from the cooked water industry was originally decided to be piloted for one month from August 1. Due to various reasons, it has been notified to temporarily stop, so as to avoid disputes. The collection situation of the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, and civil ship industry is very good, etc. Then, after each field director reported the progress of the inspection and contact, they discussed the fundraising policy and other cases until the meeting adjourned at 4:30.</p>

<p>According to the Industrial News Agency, the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute believes that the improvement of rice and wheat should start with the improvement of varieties. At the beginning of its establishment, the institute engaged in breeding work and made preliminary promotion in suitable areas, in order to actively improve quality and increase yield. However, my country has a vast territory, and the rice-producing areas are vast. The local conditions vary greatly. The original improved varieties cannot meet the general needs of various regions, and there is no shortage of excellent varieties in various regions that can be selected. However, it is a pity that farmers have shallow knowledge and do not know how to choose and plant superior varieties. In order to eliminate inferior varieties in various places, guide farmers to select good varieties, and improve rice yield and quality, it is planned to conduct pilot tests in the important rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Anhui provinces first, to test local small rice varieties, in order to establish a center for superior rice varieties, and gradually promote them to other areas. A general outline of the implementation plan for the 25th year of pilot rice variety testing and a brief chapter on the Rice Variety Testing Committee of each county are submitted to the Ministry of Industry, and the governments of Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Anhui provinces are divided to order the counties to conduct them in accordance with the pilot chapters.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that the cases of submitting applications for increasing land rent and specially requesting the increase of land on the Bund have been notified to pay the assessment fee, but those who have delayed payment were previously notified to be limited to June 30 of this year. Those who exceed the deadline should have their original cases cancelled. Now that the deadline has passed, there are still those who have not complied with the payment. The Bureau has repeatedly given deadlines for payment, and has given three orders and five requests, but they are still watching and not paying as before. The original cases should have been cancelled in accordance with the previously announced clearing method, and the land should be taken back into municipal ownership, so as to avoid the accumulation of more and more pending cases and hinder the reorganization. However, in order to give extra consideration, another extension is specially granted until August 31 of this year. All households that have been notified to pay the fee for land according to the ministry and request to increase the land on the Bund before the date of the notice must pay the assessment fee that should be paid according to the original notice within the deadline to the Bureau, so as to issue a certificate and close the case. If the payment is not made again after the deadline, the original cases will be cancelled separately, and personnel will be sent to draw public land maps based on the actual land measured, and send them to the Finance Bureau for safekeeping and disposal. Those who have adjacent original private land and are included in the map will be drawn separately, and maps and certificates will be made and notified to be collected. No further extension will be granted, and no matter what reason is given, it will be invalid. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government, it is urgent to announce it for everyone to know, so as not to make a mistake. This notice is hereby issued, signed by Deputy Director Xu Fu.</p>

<p>(Shen Bao Special Dispatch) The Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange held its sixth annual general meeting of shareholders at its market on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. 173 shareholders attended, representing 31,427 shares. In addition to reporting on the sixth operating period continuing from the end of June of the 25th year, resolutions were passed regarding the distribution of dividends. Details of each matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the customary formalities, the chairman of the exchange, Zhang Weiru, first gave a report stating that approximately 173 shareholders, representing 31,427 shares, were present at this annual meeting. The exchange's business previously encompassed more than ten types of government bonds and securities. Since the reorganization by the Ministry of Finance, there are now only five types of government bonds, including the Unified and Revival Bonds. This has severely impacted the business. Therefore, the agricultural trade market was temporarily closed for three weeks, requesting relief from the Ministry of Finance. Subsequently, the exchange implemented strict austerity measures and reduced expenditures, and business gradually improved. As a result, the dividend for this period is still more than two yuan per share, which is something to report with relief to the shareholders. If the exchange continues with this austerity policy, I firmly believe that it will gradually expand in the future.</p>
<p>Business Conditions Subsequently, Standing Director Yin Yunsheng reported on business conditions, stating that after the closing of accounts at the end of December of the 24th year, until the end of June of the 25th year, which was the end of the sixth operating period of continuing business, the operating assets were still calculated separately. The total surplus under operating items was 220,459.07 national currency, and the surplus under asset items was 148,932.63 national currency, totaling 369,391.70 national currency. After allocating various items according to the articles of association, a proposal for the distribution amount is respectfully submitted for the shareholders' meeting to deliberate and implement. Regarding the business situation of this period, the total revenue from handling fees in six months was 475,703.59 national currency, averaging slightly more than 2,964 national currency per day. Expenditures for operating expenses in six months totaled 255,479.68 national currency, averaging slightly more than 1,419 national currency per day. Various assets are still depreciated according to the old rules. Now, in accordance with Article 37 of the articles of association, various schedules have been compiled and are respectfully submitted for your review. Subsequently, Supervisor Kong Songxin reported on the accounting, (omitted).</p>
<p>Dividend Distribution Soon after, the proposed profit distribution determined by the directors was submitted for discussion. The exchange's operating surplus for this period was 220,459.07 national currency. First, 10.5% was allocated for business tax, totaling 22,248.20 national currency, which was added to the asset surplus of 148,932.63 national currency, totaling 347,143.50 national currency. 69,428.70 national currency was allocated for this period's reserve fund, and 7,584 national currency was used to replenish the previous reserve fund. After allocating shareholder dividends and employee bonuses in accordance with the regulations, it is proposed to distribute a dividend of 2.50 yuan per share for this period. The shortfall of 2,908.44 yuan will be allocated from the retained earnings of the previous period, and the remainder will still be classified as retained earnings. This was approved by resolution. At 2:30 PM, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>In the French Concession of this city, at the Hongxing Machine Factory on Caishi Road, a dispute has arisen since the factory, citing registration reasons, successively dismissed eleven workers without cause. The dispute has been repeatedly mediated by party and government organs, and the General Labor Union has sent Standing Committee member Zhou Xuexiang and others to negotiate with the factory. However, the factory's attitude has been firm, and the matter remains unresolved. At around 7:00 AM this morning, several dozen hooligans suddenly forcibly dragged male and female workers residing near Hongxing into the factory to work, resulting in a conflict. After receiving information, the Lujiiawan Police Station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to suppress the situation. They arrested the workers Ji Zongxi (male) and Lu Yundi (female), as well as the hooligans, on the spot and took them to the police station.

<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, located at 460 Hankou Road, previously decided by the board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on July 26 (i.e., yesterday) at 4:00 PM on the fourth floor of the bank. The meeting was attended by over 290 shareholders, including Chen Aishi, Feng Zhong, Pei Yunqing, Ye Yinshan, Zhu Wenqi, Shen Jisi, Lu Baoguang, Lu Zhengbing, Ma Shaoquan, Ge Shuqian, Shen Qinqi, Wang Boying, He Wuliang, Cai Shengbai, Zheng Zenan, Xu Xinliu, Yu Zuoting, Sun He, Fu Ruihe, Xu Shengyang, Chen Qingzhao, Chen Ziming, Wu Yun Chu, Cao Ziyu, Liu Zhan'an, etc., holding a total of 4,999 shares and 3,607 proxy votes. Luo Qinghua was elected as the temporary chairman. After the customary formalities, the chairman rose to report, stating briefly: "Since the establishment of this bank, it has been during the aftermath of the January 28th Incident. Industry and commerce were in decline, and finances were exhausted, making progress particularly difficult. Fortunately, thanks to the support of the shareholders and the assistance of various sectors, the amount of deposits has increased daily over the past four years, and various businesses have also been promoted in order. It has successively joined the Banking Association and the Joint Reserve Committee's Clearing House as a member and was the first to promote commercial acceptance drafts, which has been well received by society. It has also established branches and warehouses in various silk regions such as Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Beijing, and Shengze to provide various types of loans, greatly benefiting the silk industry. Its reputation has also increased as a result. However, the state of global economic downturn has deepened daily. In the past two years, due to the instability of the financial turmoil and the continuous intrusion of rumors, the difficulties encountered by this bank are conceivable. Last winter, in order to expand business and relieve the silk industry, this bank had requested Chairman Chiang to instruct the Ministry of Finance to make proper arrangements to replenish the bank's capital. This spring, after the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to investigate the bank's contents, it repeatedly ordered the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of Jiangsu to handle the matter. After repeated consultations between the directors and supervisors of this bank and the authorities of the three banks, it is now recalled that the Bank of Jiangsu has agreed to provide substantive assistance, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications serving as a backing, providing funds at low interest rates to fully expand its business. On the one hand, Chairman Wang of this bank requested the board of directors to pass a resolution to hire Mr. Lu Zidong, General Manager of the Bank of Jiangsu, to concurrently serve as the General Manager of this bank, in order to receive substantive assistance and thorough rectification. The newly appointed General Manager Lu has already arrived at the bank on the 16th of this month to take up his post and has discussed concrete measures for improving business, which are being promoted in order. Various deposits have begun to return, and the total amount of deposits has increased daily, indicating that after this bank has strengthened its financial resources and established its direction, its credit is becoming more solid, and its future is bright. Colleagues will continue to work hard and strive to live up to the trust placed in them by the shareholders. It is hoped that you will not hesitate to provide guidance and assistance." Next, the chairman read the board of directors' reports and requested their approval. As a result of the discussion, they were unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, a private car with Municipal License No. 9617 and Concession License No. 10297, traveling from south to north, was passing near the Changan Cemetery on the Shanghai-Minhang South Zhe Road. Due to the driver Sha Yongzhen's reckless driving, the car overturned into a ditch beside the road. Later, Sha Yongzhen was willing to pay three yuan and hired the local farmer Li Yugen and others to find a way to lift the car. Afterwards, Sha suddenly claimed that he had no money with him and instructed Li Yugen to sit in the car to go to North Bridge to get the money. Unexpectedly, after traveling about a li to the north, Sha pushed Li Yugen out of the car and sped away, causing Li to fall to the ground and be unable to move. At that time, a cargo truck with Municipal License No. 13757 and Concession License No. 16709, traveling from south to north, was driven by Huang Renqing. Seeing someone lying in the road, he immediately drove to the right side, causing the car to also overturn into the ditch.

<p>Longhua Temple has been in poor shape recently and is often burdened by lawsuits. Half a month ago, the temple's deputy abbot Hong Kui was sued in the District Court by the temple's hill owner Lu Mingzhao for sodomizing a believer, Yang Shouchang. The investigation was clear, and Hong Kui was detained and sentenced to three years and two months of imprisonment. One wave has not subsided, and another wave rises. The reason is that the temple owed 320 yuan to the Ruitai Electrical Appliance Store on Lujiabang Road for installing electric lights the year before last. After repeated demands for payment, they issued a check in April this year, which was from Jincheng Bank. Unexpectedly, when they went to cash the check at maturity, it was a blank, unrooted item. Therefore, the store owner Tao Junxian sued the temple in the District Court for issuing bad checks. The defendants were the abbot monk Xingkong, the manager monk Yongchan, and the deputy abbot Hong Kui (the one who was sentenced to three years and two months). After Judge Lu examined and interrogated them the other day, he ruled that the three defendants had issued bad checks and fined them each 30 yuan, with incidental civil litigation, requesting them to apply to the civil court themselves.</p>

<p>In Zhabei Tanziawan, there is a nunnery named Wannian Nunnery, currently presided over by an elderly nun named Zijian. It has over ten acres of land, over ten rooms, and over ten young nuns. Their daily life is relatively comfortable. Unexpectedly, yesterday at around 2 PM, multiple cars suddenly arrived, carrying about twenty men and women who escorted a nun inside to take over the abbess position. Nun Zijian, without any prior notice, felt as if a bolt from the blue had struck, with someone forcibly seizing her position. Therefore, she and the other nuns firmly resisted, leading to a dispute. However, the newcomers were numerous, and they were quickly outnumbered. So, they secretly reported to the Tanziawan police station, which sent officers to investigate. Upon seeing the police arrive, the twenty or so men and women who had escorted the nun got back into the cars and sped away, leaving only the nun named Xiujing at the nunnery. After questioning by the police, both Zijian and Xiujing were taken to the police station. According to Zijian, she is seventy years old, from Suzhou, and resides in Wannian Nunnery in Tanziawan. Xiujing was formerly her disciple but was expelled. They had a lawsuit that was resolved by paying one thousand yuan to leave the country, and there is evidence of this. Today, she is returning to fight for the abbess position, which is impossible, and so on. Xiujing stated that she is fifty-one years old, from Hangzhou, and currently resides at 127 Gongxing Road. From 1925 to 1930, she was the abbess. Later, a nun named Zhonglin managed the nunnery. Unexpectedly, Zhonglin suddenly died, and Zijian did not notify her, but instead illegally occupied the nunnery's property, refusing to return it to her, and so on. After verifying the statements, the interrogating officer immediately submitted them to the new sub-bureau for resolution.</p>

<p>Lu Pei, the police chief of the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Shanghai, is the younger brother of former detective captain Lu Ying. He has held the position since 1934. Recently, representatives Peng Yuanfeng, Miao Xiangben, and Liu Zhaocai, representing over a thousand Jiangbei shantytown residents, filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court accusing him of dereliction of duty and harming the people. According to them, the shacks are built on land owned by Gu Lanji, who does not interfere. However, Lu Pei repeatedly evicts them, falsely claiming requests from the landowner. When the landowner was questioned, they all denied it. The shantytown residents have suffered from the destruction of their homes and are greatly disturbed. On March 7th, the shacks near Changan Road caught fire twice. The case was heard in criminal court, but only the shantytown representatives appeared. The interrogation was not concluded. Now, Police Chief Lu Pei has accused Peng Yuanfeng, Miao Xiangben, Liu Zhaocai, and others of slander in the District Court Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Li Fen held a hearing the day before yesterday, and both Lu and Peng attended. After reviewing the case, the interrogating officer stated that because the lawsuit filed by Peng and others has not yet been resolved, the hearing will be postponed.</p>

<p>— The Egg Industry in Shanghai, Edited by</p>
<p>(Part 33 of the Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>(1) Overview: Eggs are a byproduct of farming and are produced throughout the country. They can be used for food and as raw materials for industry. As early as the early years of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, fresh eggs were shipped to Japan. In 1901, crude egg factories were first established in the Chinese mainland to manufacture egg yolks and egg whites, which were sold to export merchants and then shipped to Europe and the United States. In 1914, an American company established the Banda Egg Factory in Shanghai, at which time it had switched to mechanized frozen eggs. During the European War, sales were brisk and developed year after year. 1929 was the industry's heyday, ranking third among exported goods. In recent years, trade has been somewhat less vibrant, with a tendency to decline. This is due to the weak purchasing power of various countries and the pressure of exclusion. Chinese merchants have gradually improved the quality, and there are no defects to speak of. The United Kingdom is the largest purchaser of Chinese eggs. Of the 32,094,662 yuan of exports in 1935, the United Kingdom purchased 18,480,314 yuan, accounting for 57 percent. Therefore, how to maintain Sino-British egg trade has become the focus of discussion in the industry. Shanghai is an important market for eggs, with six frozen egg factories, one crude egg factory, thirteen crude egg factory branches in Shanghai, more than ten export merchants, and no fewer than fifty small-scale egg shops. Only Maochang Company is a Chinese-owned frozen egg factory, but the company is a leader in the egg industry, with annual sales accounting for about one-fifth of the country's total exports, which is a source of comfort for Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>(2) Production Areas and Sources: According to the seventh agricultural and commercial statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce before 1922, there were 147,648,746 chickens in the country, producing 4,489,703,425 eggs, and 52,249,322 ducks, producing 1,035,194,130 eggs. These figures seem too old and can only be used as a general reference. In recent years, due to banditry and floods in various places, coupled with the decline of the rural economy and the bankruptcy of farmers, egg production has been hit hard. At the same time, distant provinces and counties still have transportation difficulties. Even if there is a surplus, it is not easy to export. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an industrial and commercial area, and the egg production in the surrounding countryside is very limited. Its sources are roughly divided into four locations: 1. The southern section of the Jinpu Railway, such as Gangshan, Suzhou, Guzhen, Bengbu, Yingzhou, Zhengyangguan, Shouzhou, Mingguang, Haozhou, Luzhou, Puzhen, and Hexian; 2. The Yangtze River route, such as Jiujiang, Anqing, Datong, and Wuhu; 3. The Jiangbei route, such as Guanyun, Huaiyin, Baoying, Yancheng, Taixian, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Xinghua, Rugao, and Nantong; 4. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo route, such as Quzhou, Lanxi, Jinhua, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, Hangxian, Chongde, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, with the first and third routes being the most active. Crude egg products must be made into dry products before they can be transported to Shanghai. The Jiangbei route is also the most abundant source, as crude egg factories are concentrated in Jiangsu and Anhui.</p>
<p>Transportation of egg-producing areas relies mainly on railways, followed by ships. In order to encourage exports, the Ministry of Railways reduced freight rates for egg products starting from May 11, 1934. Fresh eggs were reclassified and charged at the fourth-class freight rate, dried or powdered egg yolks in boxes were reclassified as third-class freight, wet egg yolks in barrels were reclassified as fourth-class freight, dried or powdered egg whites in boxes were reclassified as third-class freight, and eggs in barrels were reclassified as fourth-class freight. Eggs coming to Shanghai from Jiangbei are packed in containers holding approximately 600 to 750 eggs each, while those from the Jinpu Railway hold approximately 800 eggs each. The weight is between 75 and 80 catties. Currently, light weight is preferred to prevent breakage. The total miscellaneous expenses per hundred catties amount to about three yuan for fast routes and two yuan for short routes.</p>
<p>(3) Types of Eggs: Eggs are composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and other substances, making them nutritious. For thousands of years, China has only used them for food and did not know their various uses. Since the rise of crude egg factories, we have learned to emulate Europe and the United States, separating the substance into egg yolks and egg whites to make various egg products. The types of egg whites are described below:</p>
<p>1. Fresh Eggs: The raw material for all egg products. If they are to be transported elsewhere, they must first undergo egg candling to distinguish their quality. After candling, they are packed in wooden boxes. Each small box can hold 360 eggs. The temperature of the boxed fresh eggs must not exceed 22 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>2. Egg Products: There are various types of dried whole eggs, dried whole egg powder, dried whole egg slices, flying whole eggs, flying egg yolks, flying egg yolk powder, dried egg yolks, and light egg yolks. Egg yolks are made with chemicals and can be divided into two types: one made with boric acid and one made with sodium benzoate. Light egg yolks are also made with boric acid, but the salt is removed. Most of the above products without salt are used as food, while those with salt are mostly used as raw materials in industry. Egg yolks are used for tanning leather, and egg whites are mostly used for food.</p>
<p>3. Frozen Eggs: Invented in the United States, this is the most complete and refined method of production. The product is packed in specially made tin cans, with each can ranging from 5.5 to 44 pounds. It is stored in cold storage. When transported, it is transported in refrigerated barges, and when exported, it is stored in refrigerated holds, which can be stored for a long time without spoiling. Also known as frozen eggs, this is currently the largest seller of eggs.</p>
<p>4. Century Eggs: Table salt, lime, red ash, , golden gong bottom, tea, and other ingredients are mixed together with appropriate amounts of water, and then fresh duck eggs are immersed in them. After about one to two weeks, they are ready. Those produced in Beijing are the most famous.</p>
<p>5. Salted Eggs: Salt and ash or clay are mixed with water and applied to the outer layer of the eggshell. They are ready after about a month. Those produced in the Jiangbei area are the most well-known.</p>
<p>The conversion ratio of egg products to raw eggs is as follows:</p>
<p>Frozen Eggs: 120 pounds equal</p>
<p>to 1,120 eggs</p>
<p>Egg Yolks: 120 pounds equal</p>
<p>to 5,600 eggs</p>
<p>Dried Eggs: 120 pounds equal</p>
<p>to 4,500 eggs (To be continued)</p>

<p>(10)(7) Singapore Miscellany</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hastily wrote a little about the situation in Singapore at the public banquet of the Singapore Overseas Chinese community. Now the mail ship has passed through the Strait of Malacca and is heading towards Colombo, Ceylon, in the Indian Ocean. There are still many things to report about Singapore, and I will extract them as follows. Singapore is the gateway to the Malay Peninsula and a hub for commerce and transportation. It is located on the coast where the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean meet, making it a strategic passage for Euro-Asian transportation. Its position is very important. Although Britain's aggression in Asia is based primarily on Hong Kong, its headquarters are in Singapore.</p>
<p>The British have a governor who manages the Malay Peninsula. The governor's office is located in Singapore. They rule the entire island with a very small number of British people and do not reveal any weaknesses at all.</p>
<p>According to a survey three years ago, the total population of Singapore is 540,000, of which 420,000 are overseas Chinese. On July 1 of this year, the government conducted another census. The results have not yet been published, but the number of overseas Chinese has probably not decreased.</p>
<p>Most of these 400,000-plus overseas Chinese are engaged in commerce. The shops we see on the streets are almost all opened by overseas Chinese. In the past, people in China thought that doing business in the South Seas Islands was like digging for gold, a shortcut to wealth. However, in recent years, the trend of depression has swept the globe, and the South Seas are no exception. The business of overseas Chinese has also been declining. In addition, the dumping policies of Japan are advancing rapidly in the South Seas. Taking Singapore as an example, there are only 10,000 Japanese people, but they occupy a large part of the commercial power, which greatly threatens our overseas Chinese who are accustomed to living in peace. However, on the whole, the business of overseas Chinese can still be sustained.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese education has been developing rapidly in recent years. There are now hundreds of elementary schools and six middle schools, all teaching in Mandarin. Most of the overseas Chinese are from Fujian and Guangdong. In the past, in addition to the Fujian and Guangdong dialects, they could at most understand English and the Malay dialect. Mandarin was almost unusable. In recent years, as a result of promoting education, the young overseas Chinese can all speak Mandarin. The textbooks in the schools are all shipped from China, but textbooks that involve imperialism are prohibited from being used. Imperialists want to maintain the security of their colonies, so this measure is expected. Overseas Chinese are more concerned about the situation in their motherland than their compatriots in China. Living overseas, they are subjected to oppression and trampling, and they pray every day that their country will become stronger and stronger. We should not neglect overseas propaganda. The municipal administration of Singapore is very well-managed. The streets are clean, the buildings are tidy, and there is lush greenery everywhere. It is simply a park-like city. In terms of public security, the governor's office maintains a very peaceful and tranquil environment with very few military and police forces. This is very noteworthy. Transportation is very developed. Not only is the city of Singapore flat and wide, but the roads throughout the Malay Peninsula, even in remote rural areas, are also accessible in all directions. In addition to connecting the important cities of the entire island, the railway also runs directly to Siam.</p>
<p>Most of the Malay natives are farmers, and their main products are rubber, coconuts, jackfruit, and pineapples. Coconut trees can be seen everywhere, and many are planted even on the sidewalks of the roads. The tall trunks, palm-like leaves, and large fruits adorn the unique tropical flavor. Tin is the main mineral product and occupies a very important position in the world.</p>
<p>(10)(8) The News Industry in Singapore</p>
<p>The news industry in Singapore is very developed. There are four English newspapers, two Japanese newspapers, and five Chinese newspapers. The five Chinese newspapers are (1) Sin Chew Jit Poh, (2) Sing Chong Jit Poh, both of which were founded with investment from the wealthy overseas Chinese businessman Hu Wenhu, (3) Nanyang Siang Pau, founded with investment from the wealthy businessman Chen Jiageng, (4) The New Citizen Daily, which is a party newspaper and has the longest history, and (5) Zonghui Xinbao, originally a royalist organ newspaper, is now a commercial newspaper. Except for Sin Chew Jit Poh, which publishes a special evening edition at 5:00 PM every day, the rest are morning editions, published at 6:00 AM every day. Except for The New Citizen Daily, which has five large sheets, the rest have six large sheets. Sin Chew Jit Poh has the largest circulation, with more than 11,000 copies. Zonghui Xinbao has the smallest circulation, with 3,000 copies. Sin Chew Jit Poh, Sing Chong Jit Poh, and Nanyang Siang Pau are all equipped with rotary presses, which makes printing very fast. The business of each newspaper cannot be balanced by revenue and expenditure and must be maintained by subsidies.</p>
<p>Although the layout and editing methods of each newspaper cannot be compared with those of the major newspapers in China, and there is much room for improvement, their dedication and tension at work are truly amazing and admirable. The overseas Chinese are very concerned about the situation in the motherland. Several major newspapers have special telegrams sent from Shanghai and Hong Kong. The special telegrams that arrive at 4:00 AM every morning can be published in the morning edition that is published at 6:00 AM. On the day we arrived in Singapore, the newspapers reported the news of our Chinese delegation in great detail. Because I was sending letters and telegrams, I went to visit Sin Chew Jit Poh. All the staff were very excited and busy preparing for the evening edition. The photos taken at the public banquet at 2:00 PM were developed and plated at 3:00 PM. The basketball game only ended at 4:30 PM, but the results were published in the two-page evening edition at 5:00 PM. As for the situation of the whole delegation arriving in port, it was even more detailed. This kind of hard work and amazing results is probably rarely matched by the major newspapers in China.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty in running a newspaper in Singapore is that the government's interference is too great and there is no freedom of speech. It is said that although the Governor's Office does not check news and speeches before the newspaper is published, the penalties are very severe if there are any errors they deem to be made after publication, and they are deported at any time. Up to now, fifteen of our compatriots have been deported back to China for running newspapers in Singapore. Therefore, the responsibility of the newspaper editor is very heavy. In general, what the Singapore government fears most is attacking, criticizing, and inciting words. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, touching their taboos is considered unforgivable.

<h3 id="e157">Shanghai Open Singles Tennis Tournament – Carson Wins Championship – Defeats Kerasha Yesterday to Retain the Beautiful Cup for One Year – Student Group Final: Tang Baojia Wins Against Li Guofan <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Tennis player Carson defeated Kerasha yesterday at the Kangdi Tennis Court with scores of 6-4, 6-4, 6-3, winning this year's first Shanghai tennis championship and retaining the Beautiful Cup (previously mistakenly called the Huacheng Cup) donated by Huacheng Tobacco Company for one year. After the match, the award was presented by the daughter-in-law of Dai Gengxin, the general manager of Huacheng Tobacco Company. The cup has a very good design and is valued at 170 yuan. Winning it three years in a row would result in permanent possession.</p>
<p>In addition to the Beautiful Cup final for open singles yesterday, there was also the student group final between Tang Baojia and Li Guofan. Their skills were similar and their performance was excellent. Li won the first set 6-3, while Tang won the second and third sets 6-2 and 12-10 respectively, thus winning the championship. Three Golden Star brand tennis rackets donated by the Huadong Sports Company were awarded by Carson to the champion Tang Baojia (two rackets) and the runner-up Li Guofan (one racket). The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Student Group</p>
<p>Tang Baojia, a student from Shanghai University, lost to Kerasha in the first week of the open singles with scores of 6-4, 2-6, 5-7. His forehand and backhand strokes are excellent, his net play is also commendable, and his court positioning is quite clever. It is a pity that his serve is slightly lacking. Li Guofan, from Yenching University in Beiping, plans to apply to Shanghai Jiaotong University. His forehand stroke is his specialty, and his serve is heavy and powerful, making for a beautiful performance. However, after each hard hit, he is extraordinarily negligent in preparing for the return, and when the opponent returns with a heavy ball, he is instead unable to cope. This is his only weakness, and this negligence in crucial shots seems to have become a habit, resulting from an inability to concentrate. His skills are not inferior to those of Tang. Both are outstanding young talents in the tennis world with promising futures.</p>
<p>The match began with Tang Baojia serving. After a 2-1 game, Li Guofan took the lead with 3-2. After 3-3, Li Guofan won three consecutive games to win the first set 6-3. Tang Baojia gradually improved, often shooting low, fast balls into the corners of the opponent's service area, and sometimes shooting deep balls towards both sides of the baseline, allowing him to lead 4-1. After Li won a game, he lost his own service game, and in the next game, he repeatedly touched the net or hit the ball out of bounds. Tang Baojia then won back a set 6-2.</p>
<p>The third set was the final set, and the competition was extremely fierce. Li Guofan once held an extremely advantageous position at 5-3. Tang Baojia calmly fought back, winning back Li's service game and winning his own service game with a slip, tying the score at 5-5. Li then took the lead again at 6-5, and Tang won another clean game to make it 6-6. Continuing to 7-6, Tang took the lead. In the next game, Tang also lost a clean game, making it 7-7 again. After that, Tang repeatedly scored first in a game, while Li equalized. After 10-10, Tang finally took two consecutive games and won the final victory. Both players performed well, earning praise from the audience.</p>
<p>In this match, there is another noteworthy event. Not long after the match began, Tang Baojia's racket suddenly broke. He temporarily borrowed the racket of his opponent in the final, Li Guofan. As a result, Li lost to Tang. Li Baojun jokingly said, "Tang Baojia borrowed a knife to kill someone." Someone else said, "Is this also 'using the Chinese to defeat the Chinese'?"</p>

<p>London, 25th (Reuters) – As a result of the first day of the Davis Cup challenge round, Britain won two singles matches against Australia, making it 9/10 certain that Britain will retain the Davis Cup for another year without any problems. In the first singles match, Britain's second player, Austin, defeated the veteran Crawford of Australia 3-1. In the second singles match, Panley also won against Quest 3-1.</p>
<p>Although Panley clearly lost many points due to carelessness, his balls were powerful and steep, and his serve was terribly frightening. In the fourth set, he scored directly on four serves.</p>
<p>Quest was unusually steady in the second set, while Panley made many mistakes. Both players committed double faults.</p>
<p>The match was interrupted several times due to rain.</p>
<p>Austin scored many points with his backhand and well-angled shots. His clever lobs and drop shots made it impossible for Crawford to respond.</p>
<p>Crawford undoubtedly suffered greatly from the wind, rain, and air conditions. His ground strokes were very weak, and his serve was generally good, except for the fourth game of the fourth set. Crawford won only three points in total. His once-famous net play earned a round of applause.</p>

<p>Berlin, 25th (National Telegram) – The president of the American Amateur Athletic Association and the American Olympic Committee today ordered the withdrawal of Mrs. Jeratto (Miss Holm's) entry, making it completely impossible for Miss Holm to participate in the competition, as Olympic rules do not allow for a second entry.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 25th (National Maritime News Agency) – According to yesterday's news, due to Mrs. Holm's reputation and the request of the majority of the American World Games team, the American World Games Management Committee reinstated female backstroke athlete Mrs. Holm. However, in order to maintain discipline, many members of the committee insisted on the initial decision. The committee then reconsidered various facts and ultimately insisted on maintaining the initial decision to punish Mrs. Holm. The 100-meter backstroke has now been replaced by Miss Edith Mcteidge.</p>

<p>Beautiful Cup</p>
<p>The Beautiful Cup final for open singles turned out to be a foreigner's affair, which was somewhat disappointing. Therefore, the audience was not very enthusiastic. Although Carson won in straight sets, the competition was still fierce. Carson's shots were as fast as arrows, and Kerasha was often able to return them quickly. Once Carson went to the net, Kerasha had no solution. As a result, Carson won three straight sets with scores of 6-4, 6-4, and 6-3, winning this year's first championship. After the match, Hu Xiansheng, the chairman of the committee, delivered a welcoming and congratulatory speech. Then, the cup was awarded by the daughter-in-law of Dai Gengxin, the general manager of Huacheng Tobacco Company and the owner of the cup. In addition to Carson retaining the Beautiful Cup for one year, the champion and runner-up were each presented with a pair of small silver cups by the company. Photos were taken, and the event ended.</p>
<p>Doubles Tournament</p>

<p>—Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Yile</p>
<p>Around 10:00 AM on July 2nd, we arrived at the Singapore wharf. No less than several hundred overseas Chinese came to welcome us, all waving small national flags in their hands, fluttering in the wind, a magnificent and beautiful sight. As the floating platform ship approached the wharf, the cheers shook the sky. The overseas Chinese's feelings for their motherland were evident. We then boarded dozens of specially prepared vehicles and toured around the entire city. Everywhere we went, there were crowds of overseas Chinese standing along the roadside. Of Singapore's population of 400,000, our overseas Chinese account for as many as 300,000. After the tour, we went directly to the overseas Chinese associations' public banquet at the Great World, which was already past 1:00 PM. More than 200 people attended the public banquet. The chairman of the meeting, Lin Qingnian, first gave a welcoming speech, followed by speeches by Hu Changyao and Hao Gengsheng. The meeting also presented the delegation with a specially made green silk flag with the words "Show Our Might Overseas" written on it. After the banquet ended at 2:30 PM, some members of the delegation watched a movie indoors, while others went shopping on the streets and visited the famous local museum. Track and field athletes went to the sports field to practice and stretch their muscles. A basketball performance was held around 4:00 PM. Because one side was the athletes attending the World Games and the other side was the elite Xinglian team from Singapore, and because there was a national martial arts performance before the match, the audience was already packed by 3:00 PM. The national martial arts performance was held first, with a speech by the leader Hao Ming. The performance program was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jin Shisheng – Shaolin Boxing</p>
<p>(2) Chuan Shuyun – Continuous Kicks</p>
<p>(3) Wen Jingming – Flower Spear</p>
<p>(4) Zhai Lianyuan – Four-Road Cup Boxing</p>
<p>(5) Zhang Wenguang – Flower Spear</p>
<p>(6) Liu Yuhua – Double Sabers</p>
<p>(7) Hao Ming – Five-Elements Hammer</p>
<p>(8) Zheng Huaixian – Flying Fork</p>
<p>The performance was well-received by the overseas Chinese. The World Games team and the Xinglian team then competed for only 30 minutes. Due to the short amount of time, they were anxious to return to the ship. As a result, the World Games team took the lead with a score of 28-25. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>(World Games Team) Wu Zuoyun, Wang Hongbin, Wang Yuzeng, Wang Nanzhen, Li Shaotang</p>
<p>(Xinglian Team) Zhang Shidi, Huang Xiuren, Lin Shuiying, Chen Kunshan, Guo Cui</p>
<p>The referee was Zhou Jiaqi. After the match ended around 5:00 PM, we returned to the ship and sailed directly towards Sinan. On July 3rd, a variety show night was held on the ship, with all the programs performed by the World Games delegation, called "Olympic Night." The order was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Singing the Party Song... All</p>
<p>(2) Chairman's Speech... Shen Siliang</p>
<p>(3) Double Act... Wang Huaiqi, Jiang Zhende</p>
<p>(4) National Martial Arts... National Martial Arts Athletes</p>
<p>(5) Funny Dance... Female Athletes</p>
<p>(6) Chorus... Female Delegation Members</p>
<p>The chess competition organized by the entertainment committee has entered the final stage after four or five days of competition. The finalists are Wu Demao and Qian Yiqin, and the final will be held on the 6th. A Chinese tea party for all on the ship was held at 10:00 AM on July 5th, with more than 100 people attending. During the party, Shen Siliang, Jiang Yong, and Hao Gengsheng gave speeches, and everyone shared their names and hometowns to get to know each other. It is said that a more advanced organization will be established soon to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>Various activities such as sports, German classes, and lectures are being held as usual on the ship. However, since the second day after leaving Singapore, the wind and waves have been quite strong, so many members of the delegation are seasick. More than one-third of them have not eaten. The ship reached Colombo, Sinan Island, around 1:00 PM on July 6th. The island is known as the "Garden of the World," and it is said that all members of the delegation plan to visit Sinan.</p>

<p>The Mecca Cup doubles tennis tournament, organized by the Portuguese man Kanavanlu, had as many as eighteen participating groups. After many rounds of elimination, the groups that won the right to compete in the final were Yu Miaoquan &amp; Tao Maojie and Dai Mingfa &amp; Zhao Xutian. Yesterday afternoon, the championship match was held. As a result, the Yu Tao group overwhelmed the Dai Zhao group with a score of 3-0, winning the Mecca Cup doubles championship this year. However, the wind was too strong yesterday, so the battle was not as intense as during the semi-finals. After the match, the award was presented by Mr. Drussel, the president of the German General Association of this port. In addition to the championship group receiving the Mecca championship cup and two cups donated by Mr. Wu Qingzhu, the runner-up group also received two Mecca runner-up cups. Immediately afterwards, Yu and Tao were welcomed back in triumph by Mr. Hui En, the president of the Xieqiao General Association, who came to pick them up in his own car.</p>

<p>— (Hua Jia)</p>
<p>There are many different views on destiny. And apart from some energetic young people, many people believe that humans are controlled by the god of destiny, especially those who are older or middle-aged and have a lot of experience. The reason is that they have more experience, more setbacks, and their vigor has been lost with their age, so they feel utterly disappointed. The reason for defending themselves that arises from this negative outlook on life is that the god of destiny controls them—if luck is bad, any effort is in vain.</p>
<p>Their reasons seem very reasonable on the surface, but sometimes after thinking carefully, they are all nonsense. The fact is often the most eloquent, and a person's efforts often overcome their destiny. Otherwise, there would be no evolution from ancient times to the present, and there would be no human history, because if everyone used destiny as an excuse not to work hard, wouldn't humans be inferior to animals?</p>
<p>The great musician Beethoven once said: "I want to fight destiny to the death, it will not completely conquer me." This sentence is very valuable. No matter how powerful destiny is, if we fight it to the death and try desperately, it will not completely conquer us. Recently, the reason why China has declined is that some people are unwilling to work hard, and seem to be waiting for death. I wonder what they think after reading Beethoven's words?</p>
<h3 id="e170">Mr. Hu Zhantang's Elegant Hobbies <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Divine Eagle</p>
<p>—Lotus Leaf Rice: Red Waist Rice—</p>
<p>Party and state elder Mr. Hu Zhantang passed away some time ago. There have been many reports in the north and south about anecdotes about the former Mr. Hu. The "Lotus Rice" and "Red Waist Rice" matters recorded in this article have not been mentioned by anyone, so it may be helpful to record them briefly.</p>
<p>In his later years, Mr. Zhantang was weak and ill, so he was extremely careful about his diet and daily life. During the summer and autumn seasons, he would abstain from meat and eat vegetarian food all day long. Even for important social engagements, he would only choose light and refreshing dishes to eat a little. In the summer of the year before last, while avoiding the heat in Hainan, he dined with Zou Haibin, Xiao Focheng, and others in the Pearl River Villa. Most of the dishes were fatty, so Mr. Hu dared not touch them. As the meal was about to end, a dish called "Lotus Leaf Rice" was brought to the table by a waiter, with a clear fragrance overflowing. Haibin smiled and said to Mr. Hu that lotus leaf rice is a famous product of Dongguan and is made entirely with vegetarian ingredients. Why doesn't sir try it? Mr. Hu nodded and chewed it slightly. Not only was it extremely delicious, but it was also fragrant and refreshing, not dry or greasy. It was truly a wonderful product for the summer season. Mr. Hu ate one-fourth of it, more than a large bowl, that day, and praised it endlessly after eating. His daughter, Gongzi Mulan, discussed it with the chef Song Silang after the banquet and hired him as a permanent chef. From then on, the "Lotus Leaf Rice" of Dongguan became famous far and wide. Many dignitaries in Guangdong often visited the private residence in Dongshan to enjoy it. After entering Mr. Hu's residence, Song also suggested to Mr. Hu's family to buy "Red Waist Rice," a specialty of Dongguan, to cook porridge for Mr. Hu, which was also sweet and delicious. The rice grains are longer than Bijeng rice, and there is a red line around the waist. The porridge is pink in color and is a refreshing and nourishing product. Unfortunately, Dongguan's production is not high, and it cannot be planted elsewhere due to soil conditions, so people in various provinces and cities can only hear its name but cannot taste its deliciousness.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Night at Touji Bridge <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>The mystery of the night, in Shanghai, used to be praised on North Sichuan Road. After January 28th, it shifted to Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. However, the low-level mystery of the night developed from the streets east of the Great World and the original Six-Ma Road and Four-Ma Road area, northward to Touji Bridge, and then westward, spreading to North Nicheng Bridge and the Jiangyuan Lane area. This is perhaps something that those who like to talk about Shanghai anecdotes should consider a feeling of vicissitude?</p>
<p>After dinner, heading north from Risheng Building, young women dressed in red and green cheongsams, powdered and jade-like, stand outside the shop windows, waiting to be courted. At the intersections of the side streets, groups of two or three are waiting, forming an orderly skirmish line. If you brush past them and glance at them, they will respond with a charming smile. If at this moment, the pedestrian slows down a bit, heh heh heh, they will secretly tell you the price of true ecstasy, and add a sentence "It's cheap!" At the same time, within this cheap price, there is still room for you to bargain by 30 or 20 percent. This scene is being played out everywhere in an area formed by the four points of Risheng Building, Touji Bridge, Nicheng Bridge, and North Nicheng Bridge. It is performed under the ghostly red light. After midnight, the eastern end of Xinzha Road is even more lined up in anticipation, almost completely occupying the sidewalks on both sides. Every prostitute's face is filled with lascivious smiles, teasing the pedestrians. Here, apart from vagrants, there is no sign of men insulting women. All there is, is the embarrassed plight of men being insulted, scurrying away. Sometimes, you can even see a comical scene of a man being half-pulled and half-dragged by several prostitutes, being pushed towards a mysterious den.</p>
<p>Hygienists say that in such a setting, the air is filled with the most disgusting atmosphere. If our glasses had the effect of a microscope, we could definitely stare blankly and see countless venereal disease germs moving in the air. This may be an exaggeration, but when we see the thriving practices of those venereal disease doctors, we should be able to understand the working efficiency of these mysterious women, right?</p>
<p>How terrifying, these evil spirits of venereal disease germs!</p>

<p>Chapter Four: Sight and Sound are Not Illusions, Hesitant to Resume Business; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted to a Generous and Strange Elegy</p>
<p>But studying these words from beginning to end, he concluded that they were very pitiful. A woman. If she uses polite words to address someone, she definitely does not treat them as a casual acquaintance. Thinking this way, it doesn't seem like one can say that she is deliberately rejecting him, right? He put the letter on the table, pressed it with a copper ruler, then put his hands behind his back and paced back and forth in the room. Sometimes he stood in the middle of the room, raised his head and looked at the sky. Sometimes he held his right elbow with his left hand, and rested his cheek on his right hand, and looked down at the ground. When he wasn't spacing out, he put his hands behind his back again and walked back and forth in the room. The old lady sat in the main room wearing a pair of large glasses, holding a piece of old clothing in her hands, sewing it in a desultory manner. Hearing the sound of footsteps constantly echoing from the study, she stopped her needlework, held the clothes in her arms, and looked towards the room, saying: "Guoqi, what is bothering you so much today that you are so restless?" Guoqi exclaimed "Oh," only then did he wake up, immediately stopped, and smiled at Granny Zhang: "You old lady, you treat me like a three-year-old child. If I walk a few more steps in the room, you become worried." Granny Zhang said: "It's not that I'm worried. You have been different recently. You are always fine, but then you start spinning around in the room, inside and out. In the past, when you were thinking about writing, you would sometimes pace back and forth in the room like this. But it wouldn't take long before you would settle down. It's not like recently, there's always something weighing on your mind that you can't let go of. What is it that's bothering you? Just tell me." As she said this, she simply took off her glasses with both hands, put them in her lap, and looked at Guoqi with even more concern. Guoqi smiled: "I definitely don't have anything on my mind. Even if I do, it's just about writing. How could I trouble you to share my worries?" Granny Zhang said: "If that's really the case, then I won't ask. But from what I see, you don't seem to be thinking about writing." Guoqi walked into the main room, intending to cover it up, but when he saw his mother's kind face, all the words he had prepared in his heart were held back. He smiled slightly and said: "A friend wrote me a letter, and I want to reply, but it's very difficult to find the right words." Granny Zhang said: "That's very common, why make such a fuss? What did he write to you about?" Guoqi shrugged his shoulders twice before smiling slightly and saying: "It's an irrelevant matter." Granny Zhang said: "If it's an irrelevant matter, why do you keep dwelling on it?"</p>

<h3 id="e173">Gaoqiao Sea Bathing <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Chonglou</p>
<p>I live in Shanghai, but I have never enjoyed the taste of a "sea bath." So this Sunday, I went to the most luxurious "sea bathing beach."</p>
<p>The sunlight shone on the bronze man at the bronze man's pier. The bronze man did not sweat like people do. The bronze man is not afraid of the hot summer.</p>
<p>Houfei and I, and our two bicycles, took the Shanghai ferry from the Bund at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>The boat carried people in the yellow river. The wind was strong, and the waves splashed on people's faces. People were like standing in the uncovered rain.</p>
<p>"Look at those red-dressed country girls, those oily green wild trees, those yellow farming cattle, those carefree chickens and dogs." I pointed out the scenery on both banks to Houfei.</p>
<p>Houfei nodded. He is also a member who is tired of urban life. The ship stopped several times and arrived at Gaoqiao at noon. Gaoqiao Wharf is still several miles away from the beach. We have bicycles to use as transportation.</p>
<p>Our cars passed through the fields, and the seedlings in the fields were all yellow! Southern women were dancing with agricultural tools. Seeing such a scene, it reminds people of the poem "Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat drips onto the soil; who knows that the food on our plate? Every grain is hard-earned!"</p>
<p>Before long, we arrived at the "Seaside Bathing Beach." We first bought tickets at the entrance, changed our clothes in the changing room (into swimsuits), and ran to the beach.</p>
<p>The scene before us unfolded. In the distance, the water and the sky were connected. Some tourists who arrived earlier than us were squirming in the water like ants. We walked barefoot on the sandy beach, leaving our footprints one by one on the sand. Walking forward, we reached the muddy ground. The mud was knee-deep, which was somewhat like the situation of farmers transplanting rice seedlings.</p>
<p>The water gradually deepened! We stopped at the place where ships came and went (because there was no water mark, it would be dangerous if it was deeper). We started swimming in the warm water under the sunlight: breaststroke, backstroke, freestyle... Houfei and I shouted excitedly, but this shout was drowned out by the sound of the waves!</p>
<p>People are like a small boat floating on a giant stream. People's hearts feel light. The waves even more diligently wash away the dirt on people's bodies, as if receiving a great baptism.</p>
<p>The tide came! The huge waves rolled and tumbled. We all returned to the shore. The sand and mud that were exposed when we came were now all submerged by the tide.</p>
<p>We rested on the shore for a while, ate some Gaoqiao specialty pastries, and then embarked on our journey home. Lightly fluttering butterflies followed our wheels, as if to see us off.</p>
<p>Although this trip was only a small circle, I felt quite satisfied in my heart!</p>

<p>— (Jin Boying)</p>
<p>In the despotic era under the emperor system in the past, the words "above" and "below" were often used to distinguish the noble and lowly classes of the governed and the rulers. Like Mencius said: "'Above' and 'below' compete for profit. 'Above' has no moral standards. 'Below' has no laws to abide by."</p>
<p>Nowadays, general writers and scholars also write: "The whole country is united 'above' and 'below'." "The government and the public 'above' and 'below'." I don't know what "above" and "below" refers to?</p>
<p>"Above" without a tile to stand on. "Below" without an awl to stand. These "above" and "below" are all included in our poor scholars. It can be said that we live in an equal position.</p>
<p>"Above" goes to heaven. "Below" goes to hell. Symbolizing the disparity between joy and suffering in the world. These two words "above" and "below" show that there is a world of difference.</p>

<p>A friend returned from Chengdu, telling me about the customs of Chengdu, so I recorded a few things:</p>
<p>Chengdu produces a lot of red beans (also known as acacia beans), which the locals call "rouge beans." They also call it "Western red beans," and there is a market price, selling for 1,000 cash per tael (equivalent to only five cents in Shanghai). There are more than thirty beans. People in that area have no interest in them. According to the record, red beans are produced in extremely small quantities, and people cherish them. There are two red bean trees on Mr. Qian Muqi's manor in Furong Village, Changshu, which have not borne fruit for several years. But the production of red beans in Chengdu has not been recorded, which is very incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The kitchen of Qingyang Palace in Chengdu is made of Phoebe zhennan wood. Phoebe zhennan wood has always been a precious wood. It is actually used to build a kitchen, which shows the abundance of Phoebe zhennan wood in Chengdu.</p>
<p>Chengdu has a kind of single-wheeled cart, which can only carry one person. The locals call it "chicken cart." It is said that it is "wooden ox and flowing horse."</p>
<p>The rice pot of Zhaojue Temple in Chengdu has a diameter of one zhang. There are four in total, which can feed 3,000 people. It is really rare.</p>

<p>In recent years, I have discovered that there are a few words that have a very mysterious meaning when used alone in a sentence. Although it can be understood tacitly, it is not easy to explain. Now I will record them below:</p>
<p>The "suo" character in "obtained a son with one 'suo'."</p>
<p>The "ran" character in "had an affair with ××."</p>
<p>The "chun" character in "spring heart moved."</p>
<p>The two characters "chun feng" in "a fleeting spring breeze."</p>
<p>The two characters "yun yu" in "secretly started cloud and rain."</p>
<p>There are many, many mysterious words like the above, simply too many to list. Due to space limitations, I cannot write more.</p>

<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>A certain gentleman had one wife and one concubine, and they were endlessly jealous of each other. The gentleman was helpless, so he went to an antique shop and bought two jade monkeys, secretly giving one to his wife and one to his concubine, without either of them knowing. He instructed them both, "Don't let anyone other than the two of us know about this, hide it well." Both the wife and the concubine obeyed and treasured them without fail. One day, the wife and the concubine both asked the gentleman, "Who do you love most between the two of us?" The gentleman said sadly, "Whoever has my jade monkey between the two of you is the one I love the most." Neither the wife nor the concubine said anything, but they were secretly delighted in their hearts, thinking that only they were loved by their husband, and the other party did not have this favor. Their jealousy then ceased. That gentleman can truly be called an expert in deceiving women. Those who have two females in the family, please pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e181">A Re-examination of China's Currency Problems <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaofu</p>
<p>Almost everyone will agree that there is still a need to re-examine China's currency problems, and that there is a need to improve China's currency facilities. However, whatever new facilities and improvements China's currency may have in the future, it seems appropriate to discuss here the main content and causes of China's currency problems up to the present!</p>
<p>As everyone knows, China's currency problem is closely related to all other disputes in China; China's currency problem is a constituent cause of China's entire economic, political, and social problems, and at the same time a product of all these problems. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as pointless moaning to propose such a currency problem for a renewed and abstract analysis. The task of this article is not to make a complete and abstract analysis of this problem, but only to provide a brief explanation of certain aspects.</p>
<p>1.  The content and causes of China's currency problem: Does it refer to the currency system problem? Or what? Perhaps the general public thinks that our currency problem is merely a currency system problem. This is insufficient. Our currency problem actually mainly includes two aspects: the relation of currency and their mutual influence.</p>
<p>We now want to look at our currency problems from a vertical perspective first.</p>
<p>Those who study China's currency problems all know, or should know, that the entire currency history of China for thousands of years is full of currency problems, and has never obtained much profound solution (in the narrow sense, the rest follows this).</p>
<p>Our monetary history is divided into two major parts by the great powers. The first part is the period before the intrusion of foreign powers, i.e., before 1842. The second part is the summer period after the intrusion of foreign powers. The period from 1842 to the present belongs to this period. The intrusion of the great powers divided China's economy, politics, culture, etc. into two parts that could not be connected in the slightest, but only produced extremely terrible conflicts, contradictions, and disorders in the distance of one hundred and eight thousand miles and in the vortex of one hundred and eight thousand miles—these are two completely different and increasingly disparate periods. This period division dissected China alive. And who was dissected? It is the Chinese masses who have suffered and are suffering unspeakable pain!</p>
<p>It is so in all aspects, why not in currency? Before the intrusion of the great powers, China was always trapped in the stagnant and cyclical feudal small-peasant economy and the quagmire of commercial capital. In this quagmire, the feudal economy sometimes declined (the period from the end of the Han Dynasty to the Sui Dynasty was a major period of decline - Note 1), and sometimes revived (the Tang Dynasty was like this - Note 2). With the rise and fall of the feudal economy, China's currency situation showed a posture of stability and development from time to time, and disorder and decline from time to time - and in the general trend, just like China's economic situation, China's currency was extremely backward. Yes, China's currency is adapted to China's economy (this is the case in every country under normal circumstances), and from the end of the Han Dynasty to the Sui Dynasty, it was very declining and chaotic; the currency of the Tang Dynasty was relatively stable and developed. (These are all examples to illustrate). And from the Zhou Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, for more than 3,000 years, China only used copper, with copper as the main currency, and what was used was still very small cash. From Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to the end of the Sui Dynasty, the famous Wushu coins ruled intermittently for 735 years. From Emperor Gaozu of the Tang Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty (let's take the end of the Qing Dynasty as an example), Tongbao coins generally maintained their authority for 1,293 years. The fact that a very small cash can rule for such a long time also shows how backward China's economy and currency were in the past. And even today, the Chinese masses still use copper as the main currency, and there are still cases of using cash in remote areas (such as Minqin, Dingxin, and Yongchang counties in Gansu Province - Note 3).</p>
<p>When the foreign forces invaded, China was still pitiful and ridiculous (but the rulers at that time felt extremely arrogant) and used its "Celestial Empire" cash greatly. At that time, the basic currency was out of the question, and the currency standard was only used in practice as the copper standard. Although silver was also used, silver was only in the position of non-coin auxiliary currency.</p>
<p>It was under such circumstances that the great powers broke through the Great Wall!</p>
<p>Before the intrusion of the great powers, China's economy was backward and exchanges were undeveloped, so its currency was also extremely backward. After the great powers intruded, they transformed China's economy with their own capitalist models (what kind of transformation did they make!). This caused China's economy to drastically commoditize. So, did China's economy and currency have a prosperous development from then on? Not at all. The great powers only fully utilized the backward historical conditions of China's economy and currency, etc., to make China continue to lag behind, make China its appendage, its tail, and its outer government. The great powers only used and are still using various general and special means to oppress China's national industry, bind and manipulate China's national currency capital, so that all of this cannot make any development contrary to the interests of the great powers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the cannons and commodities of the great powers, even in terms of currency, also imported various foreign silver dollars, and even foreign silver dollars specifically for aggression against China (the United States cast trade dollars Trade pillar to import into China) to extract our wealth. In addition, they also established banks in China and issued banknotes, attempting to directly rule China with foreign currencies. After the intrusion of the great powers, the various feudal chaos and separatism in China's currency reached an alarming degree. This indicates and reflects the fact that the great powers are supporting China's feudal forces in order to sell their plan to enslave China.</p>
<p>Precisely because of the direct and indirect (the so-called indirect refers to the great powers supporting China's feudal forces, the rest follows this) invasion and oppression of the great powers, China's currency has not been able to develop normally, and has been suffering from silver. Moreover, the silver standard system, which was established as late as 1933, was suddenly abandoned by China on October 15, 1934. The late arrival and hurried departure of China's silver standard system is another wonderful symbol of the backwardness and crisis of China's economy and currency, etc.</p>
<p>In terms of currency capital, all of China's currency capital accumulated through simple plunder, commercial capital, usury, etc., except for the vast majority that has been pocketed by the great powers, the remaining small amount is, as shown above, bound and manipulated by the great powers, and is directly and indirectly kept in the mud of usury, various speculative undertakings, and commercial capital as much as possible, so that it cannot be used for undertakings that are contrary to the interests of the great powers. (Currently, bank investment has changed somewhat in direction, but it is still very far from the central industry). As a result, China's currency capital, which cannot obtain normal economic development due to the seizure of the market and the lack of economic development, is unable to invest in the central industry, so our industry and economy are even more affected, and this result aggravates the morbid state and crisis of the currency, making it even more impossible for the currency to obtain normal economic development. If currency capital cannot be developed, how can the currency system be improved alone? And the various direct and indirect blows given to us by the American silver policy are even more "kicking a man when he's down" and "adding insult to injury."</p>
<p>In this way, the severity of China's currency problem today is the result of the direct and indirect invasion and oppression of the great powers from the economic and political aspects. Under the oppression, China has no way to develop economically, and even falls into an increasingly dangerous situation, and its currency naturally has no way to develop and stabilize. The crisis in China's currency today is the same as the danger in the economy. The biggest source of the crisis is political, not economic, special (such as smuggling), not general.</p>
<p>2.  The Basic Tone of the Solution to China's Currency Problem</p>
<p>Before talking about the basic tone of the solution to China's currency problem, we still need to talk a few words about the particularity of China's currency problem. Some of the peculiarities of China's currency, such as feudal chaos and separatism, are more obvious, so I won't talk much about them here. However, what needs to be pointed out is that the extremely (relatively speaking) backward historical conditions of China's currency and the deformed state caused by the combination of the rule of foreign financial capital are a major feature. And the fact that China has sunk so deeply into the pain and suffering of silver is also a major feature.</p>
<p>In the current state, everyone feels that it is necessary to improve our currency system, everyone feels that it is necessary to liberate our currency capital, and everyone feels that it is necessary to make our currency develop normally economically. However, talking about improvement under the increasingly pressing direct and indirect infringement of the great powers is indeed not an easy task. The gold standard, the silver standard, the gold exchange standard, etc., all have their problems to varying degrees. So, should we fundamentally abandon currency to solve the currency problem? Can we adopt methods such as "property certificates"? That's even more problematic. This is very important and very interesting, let's talk a few more words about it by the way.</p>
<p>Some people, seeing that the social economy is so difficult and that the national financial problem is becoming increasingly serious, want to indulge in fantasy and think that they can fundamentally abolish currency, this "disaster," to get rid of their troubles. Yes, even from the perspective of financial problems, it is imperative to seek improvement in currency as soon as possible. However, if you look for a way out from fantasy because the problem is urgent, it is "treating silk and making it more chaotic."</p>
<p>Understanding currency from currency is like understanding clouds from clouds and fog, and there is no way to understand it. (Currency in this article, of course, refers to gold and silver or paper money representing gold and silver). Currency is naturally grown and developed from the process of commodity exchange. Commodities and currency exist at the same time and will perish at the same time. If we preserve the commodity economy on the one hand and abandon currency on the other, it is like removing the axles on the one hand and still wanting the wheels to move forward. That is impossible. Currency is an internal development of the commodity economy and is produced by "exchange." We cannot introduce some "certificates" from outside the economy to replace currency. Needless to say, even in terms of gold and silver, obtaining large quantities of gold and silver from outside the economy (such as war booty and reparations) can naturally promote the growth of finance and the development of the economy; but the transformation of gold and silver into currency must also go through "exchange." Because currency is inherently gold and silver, but gold and silver are not originally currency. Therefore, the degree of development of currency depends on the size of the scope and value of commodity exchange.</p>
<p>The reason why currency becomes currency is because it itself is a commodity and has value. Only things that have value in themselves can be used as a measure of all values. More importantly, currency is a social relationship in a commodity society; abolishing currency will hinder and destroy this relationship.</p>
<p>Those who advocate "property certificates," "goods certificates," and similar theories have not noticed that the labor products of individuals cannot become social general labor products, that is, they cannot become exchange value and cannot become currency, before they have been exchanged. In other words, without currency, the products of each individual would either return to barter, or would be unable to circulate. Inability to circulate is of course a declaration of social stagnation, disorder, and disintegration, but barter is by no means acceptable to modern society. Therefore, if the whole country abolishes currency in this way to revolutionize currency, the result will only be to revolutionize one's own life.</p>
<p>These are some important explanations on this point.</p>
<p>So, how should we solve China's currency problem? Where is the basic tone of the solution? To put it simply, the first step is to remove the infringement of the great powers and feudal forces. But the feudal forces are supported by the great powers, so "nine nines return to one." Currently, the most important thing is to break away from the various direct and indirect infringements imposed on us by the great powers. Otherwise, all facilities will be destroyed, will be used, and will cause greater disputes and problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no way to understand currency from currency, and it will be even more impossible to solve the currency problem by solving the currency problem.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Course of Soviet Monetary Reform <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Binglian</p>
<p>Based on the difference in the socialist economic system of the Soviet Union, its monetary policy is also quite different from that of capitalist countries. What should be pointed out first is the credit system, which is sufficient to influence Soviet monetary policy. Its great difference from capitalism lies in the fact that "it can utilize all monetary assets in a planned way... because all Soviet credit institutions are concentrated in the hands of one owner—the Soviet state." Because of this reason, it can "implement a certain policy of distributing these monetary assets, so it can publicly promote the consolidation and development of socialist elements in the Soviet economy." Because the credit system plays a major role in the socialist economic sector, the government must consolidate its central credit institutions and complete its credit system. Thus, the Soviet State Bank, Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank, Cooperative Bank, Central Construction Bank, National Trade Bank... constitute this credit system, shouldering special tasks in the Soviet economic sector. For this reason, the State Bank is granted the right of paper money issuance (The Right emission), in order to facilitate financial activities and circulation. Therefore, the credit system naturally plays a major role in the Soviet Union's monetary policy.</p>
<p>Pre-Revolutionary Russia was a country with long-term financial disorder, and the credit system was almost completely destroyed. It was not until the mid-19th century that a silver standard was adopted, stabilizing it for some time. From the end of the 19th century to the outbreak of the European War, a gold standard system was implemented, which was relatively stable for a longer period. However, as soon as the war broke out, due to the over-issuance of paper money and the reduction of deposit amounts, the credit system was completely bankrupted again. Even after the establishment of the Soviet policy, the same policy had to be adopted to raise war funds in order to cope with domestic wars and the siege of international imperialism. As a result, paper money flooded the market, and prices soared. On the eve of 1922, the price of the ruble had reached the point where one pre-war ruble was equal to 288,000 paper rubles. At that time, calculations had to be done in "millions." Due to the inconvenience in calculation techniques, the Soviet government had to change the name of the paper currency. As a result, in 1923, a paper currency was issued, one ruble of which was equal to 100 rubles of the paper currency issued in 1921. However, this method of exchanging names also reduced the trouble of calculation but could not completely stop the continuous decline in the value of paper money. As a result, on the one hand, it hindered the correct calculation of commodities and hindered the development of industry and commerce. On the other hand, it also invisibly increased the burden on the working masses of workers and peasants. Therefore, the Soviet government had to urgently solve the phenomenon of paper money flooding the market and implement monetary reform. In October 1921, the government established a new state bank to take on the task of regulating finance; this bank was under the control of the People's Committee of Finance, with a capital of 200 million Soviet rubles, which was equivalent to about 15 million gold rubles at the then market price. In October 1922, the State Bank accepted the government's order and began to issue a new currency called Chiervoniets—that is, ten-ruble gold notes. This new monetary unit served as the foundation for stabilizing the Soviet state's financial disorder, and the New Economic Policy also began to be implemented in this year, which was of great significance in Soviet history.</p>
<p>At that time, 25% of the value of Chiervoniets was guaranteed by gold and stable foreign gold coins, while the remaining 75% was mostly guaranteed by promissory notes or commodities. However, it could not be used to fill the gap in the state budget, so the deficit in the budget still had to be made up for by Soviet paper money, as before. As a result, the value of paper money was still falling at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>In fact, the complete realization of the monetary reform was after 1924, because on February 5th of this year, the Chiervoniestr was distinguished by: The value of Chiervoniest would not be lower than ten gold rubles at least, and the national currency was lower than ten rubles, with one yuan, three yuan, and five yuan rubles. The national currency was issued by the State Gold Treasury Bureau, while Chiervoniest was issued by the State Bank. Chiervoniest was guaranteed by gold and foreign gold coins, etc., while the national currency had no such guarantees at all. At that time, the method of stabilizing the national currency was: A The state was responsible for circulating the national currency according to the market price of Chiervoniest (that is, one Chiervoniest was equal to ten national currency rubles), so that it could be exchanged with Chiervoniest without any obstacles. B The amount of national currency issued by the state could only be limited to what was necessary for the exchange of Chiervoniest.</p>
<p>At that time, in addition to announcing the order to issue national currency, an order was also issued on the minting and issuance of silver coins and copper coins: silver coins were divided into four types: one ruble, fifty kopecks, twenty kopecks, and ten kopecks; copper coins were divided into four types: five kopecks, three kopecks, two kopecks, and one kopeck. Among the silver coins, those with a value of one ruble and fifty kopecks contained a higher gold value, so they were divided into "high value," while the remaining twenty kopecks and ten kopecks were "low value."</p>
<p>As soon as this new plan was implemented, the issuance of Soviet paper money was immediately stopped, and the Soviet paper money was completely eliminated by exchanging it at the market price of one national currency ruble equal to five million Soviet paper money. The phenomenon of financial disorder no longer existed, and the Soviet economy obtained a solid monetary unit.</p>
<p>Since 1929, the Soviet Union has implemented a bread rationing system, domestic prices have been regulated and cannot be unified, and state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives have emerged. Because the prices of goods sold in state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives are different from those of the working class who have bread ration coupons, their prices are always several times more expensive than general prices. Moreover, state-owned stores must use foreign currency; this system naturally had great significance in consolidating the Soviet economy at that time. Otherwise, the Soviet Union's socialist industrial construction could not have proceeded smoothly. By 1930, Soviet Russia's finances felt difficult, because the practice of the Five-Year Plan and the temporary demands of various organizations required huge amounts of funds to be increased and added to the annual budget and final accounts, so it was necessary to issue public bonds and huge amounts of paper money according to the plan to make up for the deficit. However, the production of commodities must be adapted to it, so as not to destroy the balance between currency and prices. However, industry in this year could not be fully carried out to this extent, and the light industry sector was the first to be in this state in terms of quantity. As a result, the industrial and financial plans were affected, and huge amounts of funds needed to be added. On the other hand, the collective farms and state-owned farms, which broke through the Five-Year Plan and developed rapidly, also needed huge amounts of subsidies. Even so, the State Bank and the People's Committee of Finance had to issue paper money beyond the plan to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>According to the increase rate of the Soviet Union's currency, it is usually 30%, and in the early part of that year (1930), the issuance of Soviet national currency had reached 2.2 billion rubles, the issuance of paper money had reached 3.8 billion rubles, and the issuance of public bonds had reached 2.4 billion rubles; the increase in currency was already very huge. From April to October 1930, it increased to 48.5% according to the normal increase rate, and at the end of the year, it increased to 61%, which was more than double the normal rate. This huge increase immediately shook the stability of the Soviet monetary system. Therefore, the seriousness of this financial difficulty can be imagined.</p>
<p>During this period, the Soviet government, in view of this critical situation, immediately ordered the People's Committee of Finance to stop the issuance of paper money for the large amounts of funds needed by the Grain Preparation Committee, economic construction, cultural construction... in the fourth quarter. The cessation of paper money issuance, in turn, caused the currency to stagnate in the hands of the people, unable to be transferred to the national bank's treasury. At the same time, the low increase rate of light industry also made it impossible to absorb the people's purchasing power, so the State Bank had to stop payments in order to save the shortage of currency.</p>
<p>Thus, due to the volatility of the currency and the emptiness of the national treasury, the Soviet government had to find ways to overcome this difficulty from the objective situation, otherwise the entire economic system would fall into bankruptcy. Therefore, the government immediately seized several characteristics of the time to seriously implement:</p>
<p>(1) Expand the increase in production and promote the movement to increase labor productivity;</p>
<p>(2) Overcome the uneconomical operation, establish an economic clearing system, systematically reduce production costs, strictly pursue profits, and intensify accumulation within the industry</p>
<p>(3) Overcome the lack of strictness in the fiscal plan. And because of this, it is related to the reform of the fiscal plan, tax system, credit system, etc.</p>
<p>This difficulty was completely overcome in early 1931. And the Five-Year Plan broke through these many difficulties and achieved great development. This also explains the significance of the Soviet State Bank's announcement of another monetary reform on December 1, 1935. That is to say, the shift of the monetary system changes with the development of the economy. In the past few years, the Soviet economy has made rapid progress, gradually becoming a self-sufficient country, and the national economy has been improving day by day, so the change of its monetary system is a matter of course.</p>
<p>This monetary reform is adapted to the improvement of the Soviet national economy; it is closely related to the abolition of the bread rationing system, and it also has great significance.</p>
<p>In the past, the establishment of state-owned stores was implemented at the same time as the bread rationing system, mainly to facilitate the purchase of people who did not receive bread ration coupons, which was due to the prevention of food panic. Now that bread rationing has been abolished and the development of the food industry is sufficient to supply it, the state-owned stores will naturally be abolished, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>After the abolition of state-owned stores, the prices of goods in the Soviet Union gradually became unified, without the special differences that existed before. At the same time, due to the increase in the value of the ruble, workers' wages have also increased invisibly. On the other hand, the progress of production has also promoted the decline in prices. According to a TASS dispatch on November 9 last year, "In the first nine months of this year, the total wages increased by 23.2% compared with the same period last year, while in the past ten months, the prices of collective farm products fell by 20-25%." At the same time, Havas also telegraphed, "From January next year, retail prices will be suppressed by 15-40%, and wages will also be reduced, but the reduction rate will not be as great as the reduction in the prices of manufactured goods and food; in other words, although wages appear to be reduced on the surface, actual wages will increase instead." From this, we can see how much the improvement of the lives of Soviet workers and peasants has reached.</p>
<p>Due to the reason for abolishing state-owned stores, the method of paying in foreign currency for the money remitted to Soviet residents from abroad has also been abolished, and it is completely paid in Soviet legal tender. Therefore, the government stipulated that its market price was 1.333 francs per 100 rubles, but it will not apply until January 1 this year, and it will be raised to a price of three francs per ruble. Foreign exchange has also changed because of this. In the past, the exchange rate was about 13 francs and 60 centimes per ruble, but foreigners were unwilling to exchange rubles at this market price because state-owned stores exercised foreign currency. In fact, the purchasing power of the ruble was less than half a franc in the past, but after it was set as half a franc, the living standard of foreigners could not help but increase. However, now that the prices in the Soviet Union are still falling continuously, the purchasing power of the ruble will also increase accordingly, and the lives of foreigners will not suffer because of this.</p>
<p>Since this monetary system was reformed again, the Soviet Union's international exchange will undoubtedly be more stable, which is of greater significance to the Soviet Union's foreign trade. In today's international currency war, which is becoming increasingly acute, it is not without significance to trace the progress of the Soviet Union's monetary system and its role in economic construction.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Securities: The Situation is Peaceful, Government Bonds See New High Prices Together <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from July 20 to 25, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was the last week of the July futures. It coincided with the gradual and thorough resolution of the special events in Guangdong and Guangxi. The national unification that had been expected for more than ten years was finally realized, and it also affected the monetary system issue, so it was also unified. Due to the good political situation, the financial situation was also given a considerable solution, and government bonds soared as a result. There was also talk of control over the foreign exchange level, and cash flight has since been convertible. The government bond market was originally dominated by shorts, so covering shorts and going long rose at the same time. At this time, the term of this month was approaching, and it was squeezed by the environment, forming a short squeeze. Types A and B saw new highs repeatedly, which was a good phenomenon that had not been seen since the issuance of unified government bonds. Now the July contract has stopped trading. Today, only the August futures for one month are temporarily auctioned. All kinds of interest are excluded from the calculation. The market price is not easy to flow out, and it is feared that there is still a rising trend. Generally speaking, last week can be called a week of rising trends, climbing step by step, and the situation is very strong. In April, the highest price for Type A was 69 yuan and 20 cents. At the beginning of last week, it was 9 yuan and 40 cents, then it was 9 yuan and 70 cents again. On Thursday, it actually broke through the 70 yuan mark, and at the end, it saw the highest price of 11 yuan again. Because the number of contracts in July was small even after winning the lottery, its rising trend was uniquely strong. Type B only saw the highest price of 67 yuan and 05 cents, but the August contract also included winning the lottery. At present, the market price is cheaper for Type B. In the future, there should be a time when it will stand out and have different characteristics. The future of government bonds is that if the situation in North China is peaceful, there is still a possibility of prosperity. The market price results last week all continued to rise by several angles to 2 yuan and 20 cents. The total turnover was 62.61 million yuan. Here is a table comparing the results of its rise and fall (unit turnover unit 100 yuan)</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were still only numbers 13 and 14, with a total of 2,500 to 2,600 piculs of goods, but the sales field showed a sluggish and unmoving state. Moreover, the appetite was only 500-odd bags from the Qingdao gang, which made the market extremely weak. Judging from the situation, it is difficult to have hope for a turnaround in the short term. Now, if the thick early japonica and thin rice quotations continue to fall by one angle, the medium lodging ones depreciate by different amounts outside the ruler. Du Yangjian silver is close to the angle, and the cloudy change yuan has no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 20 sources from various gangs in Hexia. The goods in the market did not move, and the transactions of those who picked fresh and short-priced ones were also minimal, resulting in a small decrease in the price of white japonica by a few points to one cent. Thin rice also narrowed by a small amount near the ruler. White yuan was stable, and those with fresh tops of lamb fragrant rice fell by a small seven or eight points. Although the price of medium and sub-grade lamb fragrant rice and Dupu currency was reduced by a small one, two, or three angles, there were still no actual sales. The remaining colors also showed a weak trend.</p>

<p>Xu Kuizi: According to a letter from the production area yesterday, a few new products have been seen. The trade here has also obtained a small sample. The quality of the goods is still good, but there is no certainty in the shipment, and there is no official market price. It is expected that the first batch of new goods will officially enter the market in the near future.</p>
<p>New Apricot Kernels: Several pieces of Jiu Daomei kernels have arrived in skewers. The customer's price is 50 yuan, but the sales price is only 46 yuan, which must be a loss. Weidian: A small number have also been transported. It is heard that the high-end price in Tianjin is 63 yuan, and the lower end is 45 yuan. The next batch of the above style will also be shipped to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Qi Cai, the standard lion's mane has been lacking in arrivals for a long time. When customers need it, there are no goods to supply. Even the Chong lion's mane and the upper and middle-grade goods in Xilan are currently rare in stock. There is a constant feeling of shortage. However, the source of middle and lower-grade goods is still strong and can be used for sales, resulting in a situation where the market is raised high and lowered low. The current market price is 18 yuan to 17 yuan and 50 cents for selling Chong lion's mane, 17 yuan and 50 cents for high-grade Xilan, 16 yuan and 50 cents to 16 yuan for ordinary goods, 15 yuan and 50 cents for short and thick strips, 15 yuan and 40 cents for high-grade Longya, 13 yuan and 80 cents for lower grades, 13 yuan and 60 cents to 12 yuan and 20 cents for Wudun, and only 6 yuan and 30 cents for red, ripe, short, and thick Dilong tea.</p>
<p>Shengfen, the period for new products is still two months away, but the stock of old goods in this city is very abundant. It is estimated that the bottom amount of each grade is more than 30,000 bags. Moreover, because it is the summer season, business is declining. However, Renqiang brand goods are in short supply for spot goods. There are only more than 1,500 bags in stock in the market. The market price has increased by seven or eight angles. The remaining grades are all in a state of decline. The price is 15 yuan and 50 cents for Fei Qilin, 13 yuan and 20 cents for Renqiang, 11 yuan and 20 cents for European standard brand, 1 yuan and 60 cents for sub-brand, 10 yuan and 05 cents for Sun, and 9 yuan and 80 cents for Wufu. Goods such as the national flag, three fish, handprint, and three shrimp are 9 yuan and 40 cents, and domestic Wenzhou goods are 11 yuan and 50 cents to 8 yuan and 40 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday's hardware transaction, because it was the day of the week, not many people came to the guild, so the various goods opened were relatively deserted. However, the standards in various markets were still firm because people were in good spirits. 40 tons of bamboo steel bars were handled by the construction gang at a price of 126 yuan. More than 300 sheets of English steel plates were purchased by gangs from Yantai, Qingdao, and Xuzhou, with a market price of seven and a half cents, which is one angle better. There were no other changes. Yuan nails, angle iron, sharp iron, new lead wire, white skin, etc. from this factory were all sold in the market yesterday, but the number was not large and the price fluctuated little. However, pure antimony, which has not moved for a long time in South Shanghai, was reported by a Changsha merchant with a good mindset, and the quotation was firmer than before, so the Shanghai market standard was also higher than before, selling for 665 yuan per ton, an increase of 10 yuan compared with before. It is heard that transactions were only made by enamel factories and Hongkou factories. As for the foreign merchant business, there is still no news.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, with each month rising six to nine points. The news from Liverpool was good. Domestic, foreign, and Liverpool merchants all bought in. The price increase was due to the firmness in October and the continued strength of spot goods in the South. It is generally believed that recent buyers have absorbed most of the old cotton, and spot merchants are reported to have sold a lot of new cotton. The weather in the eastern part is getting better, and Oklahoma is still dry. In New Orleans, the July contract has been suspended. At the opening, it jumped to one angle and four points due to scattered short covering, and then sharply fell to one angle, two cents, eight dimes, and three haos. The close was firm, with spot goods rising fourteen points and futures rising ten to fourteen points. English cotton spot goods rose seven points, and futures rose seven or eight points. Indian cotton rose due to short covering and recent sellers entering the market. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by three rupees, Aomula rose by four rupees, and Bairoxi rose by three and a half to three and three-quarters rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 25th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast on the 27th was 233 and a half rupees for Bairoxi in July and August, up one rupee, 222 and a half rupees for Bairoxi in April and May, up 1.25 rupees, and 200 rupees for Aomula, up 0.75 rupees.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Simple Pigment Injections Cannot Cure Gonorrhea <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Chen Zongkun of the Imperial Medical University of Japan Since Mr. Benda advocated the use of pigments to treat gonorrhea, its effect has been more than doubled compared to the previous "transmembrane sterilization" preparations, so it is praised by general doctors. As a result, the pigment injections of various countries are produced more and more, and the scope is gradually expanding. However, their quality is mixed and impure, which greatly affects the original efficacy. It must be strictly extracted and made. However, once it is extracted and made, its efficacy will inevitably be consumed a lot as a result. Therefore, disinfected pigments that have been refined must be used with other auxiliary products. Some are used with sandalwood oil, and some are mixed with myrrh. In fact, this type of mixed drugs has greater side effects, such as vomiting and nausea, and pale forehead color after taking them. However, Dr. Peter uses the latest scientific methods to completely remove the crude parts of the pigment, while absolutely preserving the original efficacy of the drug. He also uses proteome to increase the phagocytic power of white blood cells, and then successfully created the drug "Kelinong". As soon as this drug came out, all other drugs fled in panic. Its great magical effect and the complete absence of side effects have long been praised by doctors all over the world. Therefore, there is no shortage of examples of those who imitate the stomach. When purchasing various cheap and inferior miscellaneous brands, do not mistakenly purchase this because of trusting others and being confused, which may cause life-threatening danger after taking it. Be sure to pay attention to the three words "Kelinong".</p>
<p>As for the main effect of "Kelinong", it is good for treating male anterior urethral gonorrhea and chronic testicular prostatic bladder inflammation, female vulvar gonorrhea, uterine gonorrhea, etc., and other male and female urethral infectious diseases, and arthritis caused by systemic gonorrhea poison. After being cured, it can be completely eradicated and will never recur in life. However, it is best for women with gonorrhea, and the genitals are symptomatic and overflowing. At the same time, use "Carl Xuedi's vaginal tablets" externally as suppositories, then the treatment effect will be better.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Those with Gastrointestinal Diseases Should Pay Attention <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>The most common disease in summer is gastrointestinal disease. If you lie in bed at night and greedy for coolness and eat unclean things by mistake, it will cause severe vomiting and diarrhea. If this symptom continues, it will inevitably turn into chronic, causing indigestion, loss of appetite, belching acid water, and eventually lead to malnutrition and malignant anemia. In my experience, this type of acute gastroenteritis is best to reduce inflammation and restore the normal function, and it can naturally be cured. Among the various preparations, only the efficacy of "Qiangweijing" is unique, and it has no side effects, so I appreciate it for use.</p>
<p>Because this medicine has the ingredients of enzymes, it is a good medicine to reduce internal fermentation products and increase Rongyang. It has outstanding efficacy for chronic stomach diseases, vomiting and nausea, chest tightness, lack of appetite, belching and acid reflux, mental fatigue, and pale skin. Once taken, it can be cured step by step.</p>
<p>In addition, "Qiangweijing" contains a large amount of vitamin B, which is very effective for patients with beriberi, and is rich in egg yolk, which is particularly effective for relieving constipation in quitters and addicts. And it has a good effect in correcting the sluggishness and hyperactivity of intestinal function. Such as constipation, farting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc., can be cured by taking this. It is also suitable for infants with vomiting milk and green stools.</p>
<p>What is regrettable about general digestives these days is that the Rongyang source is insufficient. Now "Qiangweijing" contains a large amount of Rongyang salt, so it can provide Rongyang supply to the human body. It is especially suitable for those who have been sick for a long time and have not recovered. It is best for the weak and weak stomach to take this medicine together with "Butikang" for men or "Butinurong" for women to increase the vitality of the whole body cells, and health will be easily restored.</p>

<p>Matters to Note in the Medical Treatment of Lung Disease</p>
<p>There are many treatments for lung disease, each with its own appropriate indications. Even the most common sunlight therapy is not suitable for patients with fever. Among them, only medication is necessary for all types of lung disease symptoms. Therefore, taking medicine for lung disease seems unimportant but is actually extremely important. Although there are many preparations available nowadays, how many truly meet our ideals? It is truly regrettable. Furthermore, common lung medications often have side effects such as excessive sweating, anemia, and digestive problems. Recently, I have often seen medical journals from Europe and the United States praising the effectiveness of "Pulmonal" in treating various stages of lung disease symptoms such as hemoptysis, expectoration, cough, decreased appetite, chest pain, dizziness, or night sweats, body fatigue and thinness, and lower back pain. When administered, it works like a hammer striking a drum. Remarkable results are achieved within weeks. Furthermore, for lung patients who also have neurasthenia, such as insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, dizziness, and women with menstrual irregularities, and men with spermatorrhea and kidney deficiency, I often prescribe this medicine to treat their tuberculosis, while separately prescribing "Buttkang" for men to treat their kidney deficiency and "Yuk Jing Pills" to consolidate essence and stop spermatorrhea, and for women, "Butt Nui Yoong" to regulate menstruation and nourish blood, to strengthen brainpower and invigorate physical strength. When taken simultaneously, the results are truly beyond what one can expect. This is recorded for the information of lung patients.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea with Increased Libido</p>
<p>Increased libido is inherently a pathological condition, and nothing is more detrimental to the vitality. However, many gonorrhea patients, due to prolonged illness that does not go away, gradually fall into a state of mental depression, exhibiting a pseudo-excitement, and their libido is consequently increased. Frequent spermatorrhea leads to mental abnormalities, and a sense of disillusionment and pessimism arises. They become decadent and procrastinate, unwilling to seek medical treatment. The bacteria multiply daily, the body becomes increasingly weakened, and they ultimately become victims of gonorrhea, which is truly lamentable. Many promising young people often contract this condition, believing their bodies are strong, and delay treatment, leading to chronic conditions such as frequent urination, stinging pain in the penis, and a dull, distended feeling in the perineum and anus. Urination is often accompanied by spasmodic ejaculation, which increases libido and makes the penis prone to erection, and sperm is ejaculated as soon as they close their eyes at night. This is followed by blood, and all sorts of complications arise, leading to exhaustion of the mind and body.</p>
<p>To treat such gonorrhea with various complications, conventional treatments and ordinary oral medications are naturally ineffective. The most advanced treatments in the world, in addition to using electricity and anti-gonococcal serum, also involve taking "Clinon" to increase the body's anti-toxic and bactericidal power, so that the gonococci in the local lesions are eliminated, and the gonococci scattered in various places are also destroyed. At the same time, "Buttkang" is taken to sedate the sexual nerves and stop spermatorrhea. This is a comprehensive and proper treatment. With this treatment, the recovery rate is over 96-97%. However, this disease is most easily transmitted to the opposite sex. If, unfortunately, the wife is also infected and develops gonorrheal leucorrhea, then "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally to cleanse the local leucorrhea, and "Clinon" can be taken internally to kill bacteria, so that both leucorrhea and gonorrhea can be cured.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Respiratory Diseases <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Respiratory diseases encompass a wide range, but what is being discussed here mainly concerns common colds and bronchitis. Many chronic respiratory diseases often originate from colds and flu, such as bronchitis, whooping cough in children, bronchiectasis, asthma, and phlegm-fluid retention. These diseases can only be treated with a type of gum oil, but due to its many side effects, it is not suitable for indiscriminate use. Therefore, Tu Mei extracted a pure version and incorporated it into "Pulmonal." Thus, this medicine is indeed effective for the above-mentioned respiratory diseases, and a cure can be guaranteed after taking it.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Precautions for Leucorrhea in Hot Weather <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Jin Yueren</p>
<p>Leucorrhea is already troublesome and unpleasant in normal times, but it is even more so in summer. This is because this type of secretion constantly emits a peculiar odor. When the weather is not very hot, it can barely be concealed, but in the hot summer, due to the thinness of clothing and the increase in secretions, this disgusting odor of leucorrhea spreads through the air, and everyone who smells it covers their nose and passes by. Moreover, moist areas are most prone to attracting bacteria, leading to serious problems, such as pyogenic bacteria. Leucorrhea can cause local ulceration, vulvar distension, stinging pain during urination, abdominal bloating, and often leads to menstrual difficulties and is a major cause of infertility.</p>
<p>Patients can use "Carter's Snow White Vaginal Tablets" (referred to as Carter's Vaginal Tablets) as an external suppository for a radical cure. This is because this tablet has the functions of sterilization, antisepsis, pain relief, and anti-inflammation, so it can be cured in a short period of time. However, those with gonorrheal leucorrhea can also take "Clinon," and those with deficiency can take "Butt Nui Yoong," which will have great effects.</p>

<p>Causes and Treatment of Premature Aging</p>
<p>When a person reaches old age and exhibits signs of senility, this can be called premature aging. The phenomenon of premature aging is not only on the physical appearance, but also a layer of senility shrouds the mind. Therefore, this kind of premature aging cannot be said to be natural, but pathological. Because it is pathological, it can be solved by scientific methods. Now let's first talk about its causes. The causes of premature aging are mostly due to the dysfunction of the endocrine system, and the biggest cause of damage to the endocrine system is masturbation in youth or early marriage and excessive sexual activity. On the one hand, the overall function is stopped because it cannot get the irrigation of the endocrine system, and the blood also reduces its production and activity. This leads to anemia, a haggard face, wrinkles on the forehead, and weakened vision. All senses are dulled. On the other hand, the lower body also stops developing, becoming as small as a child. For women, the breasts and buttocks are not fully developed, and there are other problems such as weakened sexual nerves and menstrual difficulties.</p>
<p>In the past, there were no suitable methods to reverse such premature aging. However, since Mr. Mei Lun invented "Buttkang" for men and "Butt Nui Yoong" for women, the suffering of both men and women has been relieved. These two drugs are made from hormones extracted from the testicles and ovaries of strong animals. After injecting it into aging guinea pigs, they felt lively and full of spring in a short period of time. Satisfactory results were also obtained in experiments with other animals. All infertility, incomplete development, dizziness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, forgetfulness, and lack of energy in men and women, as well as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and weak erection in men, and menstrual disorders and chlorosis in women, can be effectively treated by taking these two drugs. It is indeed a new discovery in medicine. It is widely used by European and American doctors.</p>

<p>The Harm of Misdiagnosis of Acute Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Wang Yurun, during acute gonorrhea, had swelling of the foreskin, and pus filled the urethral opening. He had frequent urges to urinate, and each urination caused severe pain. He privately purchased some inferior medicine and underwent a poor surgical procedure. Instead, the gonococci were deeply introduced, leading to a terrible bladder inflammation, blood in the urine after urination, many sediments, gonorrheal filaments floating on the surface of the urine, abdominal bloating, and almost complete urinary retention, and the body temperature rose, posing a danger of uremia. He then changed to my clinic for treatment. In addition to performing a urinary drainage operation, I prescribed the special gonorrhea medicine "Clinon" to promote urination, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and detoxify. In about three weeks, the gonorrhea symptoms were gone by six or seven tenths, and he continued to take "Clinon" for more than ten days, and the condition was completely cured. After repeated examinations, there was no gonorrheal reaction. Mr. Wang regretted his mistake of taking inferior medicine in the past.</p>

<p>Patient Mr. Zhou Zhiping, 25 years old, married, and the couple were very affectionate. But one night, he suddenly stumbled into a brothel. For four or five days, he did not feel any stinging or itching, but soon after, he developed gonorrhea symptoms. Mr. Zhou greatly regretted this and underwent several treatments, but to no avail. The couple's feelings deteriorated as a result. Later, through the introduction of a neighbor to my clinic, it was determined that he had developed chronic prostatitis. In addition to performing local massage, I prescribed the German "Clinon" to promote the disappearance of inflammation and prevent decay and promote diuresis. After five weeks of continuous use, the disease was radically cured. His wife's gonorrhea had become cervicitis, so she used "Carter's Snow White Vaginal Tablets" to remove inflammation, prevent decay, and reduce swelling, and took "Clinon" internally to eliminate the internal gonorrheal toxins. She also recovered in about four weeks. They have lived together ever since and have not relapsed, and their original love has been restored.</p>

<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>Due to the stimulation of the endocrine system, people in the sexually mature stage have thoughts of spring. Qixian Shi said, "Ninety-nine out of a hundred people commit masturbation, and the remaining one may not be telling the truth." Therefore, the disease of spermatorrhea induced by masturbation has a very wide range of patients. Some have nocturnal emissions due to erotic dreams, some have daytime spermatorrhea, or dripping during bowel movements and exertion. The special medicine for the treatment of this disease is Nai's "Yuk Jing Pills" because this medicine can calm the nerves and reduce endocrine stimulation, so diseases such as masturbation and spermatorrhea can be cured by taking it. If you suffer from cerebral weakness, forgetfulness, palpitations, insomnia, dizziness, back pain, premature ejaculation, or impotence, you can take this medicine with "Buttkang" at the same time, and you will get strong nerves, and various symptoms of weakness can be cured. "Yuk Jing Pills" are sold at Wing On Company and Chinese and Western pharmacies.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea and Insomnia</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xiyuan, has been troubled by gonorrhea for a long time, resulting in neurasthenia, headaches, insomnia and other symptoms. His gonorrhea part is a combination of paraurethritis and prostatitis. Urination is sometimes smooth and unobstructed, sometimes difficult and abnormal, sometimes with many drips, sometimes with abnormally clear urine, and sometimes with blood after urination, changing unpredictably, and he has long infected his wife with this disease. After repeated treatments, it has not been eradicated. Introduced by a friend to Dr. Yao Juyan for treatment, he was instructed to take "Clinon" and "Buttkang" on the same day to eliminate gonorrheal toxins and search for gonococci in the depths, and to sedate his nerves. After more than a month, the gonorrheal toxins were eliminated, and the insomnia was also cured. As for his wife's leucorrhea, Yao introduced her to take "Clinon" internally and "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, which was also cured in four weeks.</p>
<p>Mistakenly Taking Inferior Medicine</p>
<p>Mr. Li Haicang, last month, on a whim, broke into a brothel and contracted gonorrhea. The symptoms were dangerous, such as burning sensation in the urethra, pain like needles, inability to urinate, but frequent urges to urinate, and the glans foreskin was red and swollen and presented a huge transparent body. Misled by a certain inferior medicine theory, he purchased and took it, but unexpectedly, vomiting occurred frequently, and the chills and fever became more intense. He urgently changed to Dr. Wu Zhonglin for treatment, and learned that it was acute gonorrhea, and that the vomiting caused by taking a certain miscellaneous brand of medicine before was due to the toxicity of the side effects of the medicine. Fortunately, he had stopped taking it, but his gastric digestive function was greatly damaged by this. He was instructed to take "Clinon" to reduce inflammation, reduce swelling, relieve pain, and remove gonorrhea, and he recovered in just three weeks. It can be seen that the effect of the right medicine is very fast. As for his poor digestive function, he was told to take several bottles of strong stomach essence to restore his digestive power. He was completely cured after taking less than four bottles.</p>
<p>Applying to a Company</p>
<p>Mr. Ni Fengyuan, was infected with gonorrhea. Because he was applying to a large company, he was afraid of being rejected due to physical disqualification. He secretly took various gonorrhea medicines to speed up recovery, but he was greatly annoyed when the toxicity increased. Fortunately, he was introduced by his classmate Dr. Chen Shaohua to take "Clinon." He bought it from the Chinese and Western Pharmacy and took it. In less than a month, the gonorrhea was completely cured. He went to the company to register for the exam and passed the physical examination. As a result, he was hired by the company. Mr. Ni thanked "Clinon" for its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Yang Zibo from Hubei</p>

<h3 id="e202">Abolishing Petty Gratuities <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>"Petty gratuities" are a bad custom that needs to be abolished. In various places in China, hotels, teahouses, restaurants, bathhouses, theaters, barber shops, and other entertainment venues all have the practice of charging petty gratuities. This is a widespread practice in various industries and has become a customary rule. Restaurants openly hang up signs that say "Patrons are requested to add a gratuity." Not only that, what is even more unreasonable is that in addition to the petty gratuity, the waiter or attendant also demands a tip for the drinks? This counts as an extra petty gratuity. Moreover, the amount of the petty gratuity is fixed, while the extra petty gratuity is not. Therefore, waiters and attendants often arbitrarily demand them. This is not only inconvenient for customers, but also has a significant impact on the business of various industries.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement General Association, in view of this, believes that the collection of petty gratuities by various industries violates the spirit of the New Life Movement, and has formulated "Implementation Measures for Eliminating Extra Petty Gratuities" and distributed them to New Life Movement associations throughout the country for promotion in order to abolish this bad custom.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted here that the bad custom of collecting petty gratuities is closely related to the waiter system. In hotels and restaurants throughout China, the wages of employed waiters and employees are very low, or even non-existent, and they rely on petty gratuities as compensation. This is naturally a good deal for the operators, who have customers pay to hire employees. The waiters and employees also do not work for free, and those with high skills sometimes earn more from petty gratuities than from ordinary wages. This is also the origin of the forced demand for drink money. Therefore, we believe that to eliminate petty gratuities, we must fundamentally improve the waiter system in various industries, which is convenient for guests. This is the best example.</p>
<p>Recently, some entertainment venues in this city have voluntarily abolished petty gratuities, which will definitely be very beneficial to their business. We hope that various industries can follow suit and abolish the bad custom of petty gratuities. This may be an effective way to revitalize business.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Mosquito Incense <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinfei</p>
<p>Pushing open the window, in front of me is a large meadow.</p>
<p>This meadow was originally a wasteland. When I moved here, it was barren. Now it is covered with lush fragrant grass. In the evening, groups of children come here to play soccer, using it as a soccer field. At night, it becomes the headquarters of mosquitoes, buzzing around everywhere.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about installing a screen window to keep out the mosquitoes and block the wind, but I always put it off because I can't afford it. If I close the window, there are fewer mosquitoes, but it's unbearable hot. If I don't close it, there is wind, but also swarms of mosquitoes, bumping into people's legs and buzzing incessantly in people's ears, making it impossible to read a book or write a few words.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have to resort to mosquito incense, hoping to use its power to get some peace and quiet. Isn't this a good time to read a little or write something in this pleasant breeze?</p>
<p>The mosquito incense is lit. I even prepared an incense cage for it. Looking at the light blue smoke rising up, I have the lighthearted feeling of an old poet. I feel that it is worth it to light a coil of mosquito incense just to add a little so-called "poetic flavor." At the same time, those lines of poetry like "leaning against the incense burner until dawn" and "a red sleeve adds fragrance" also come to mind.</p>
<p>Enjoying the cool breeze, like a new moon hanging in the clouds, watching the light blue smoke rising, and listening to the intermittent insect sounds on the grass, the voices of the people chatting in the shade under the wall also seem blurred. This is a poetic realm.</p>
<p>But this poetic realm is immediately pulled back by reality. The mosquitoes are no longer buzzing in my ears, they are all concentrated under the desk, bumping and flying around on my legs, making my legs itch and swell up again.</p>
<p>I rub the itchy spots with flower dew, and then light another coil of mosquito incense under the desk. This time, I lit the lighter with a triumphant and contemptuous smile. My heart also gently leaped and said: "I have a better weapon than you, let's see how you deal with me!"</p>
<p>In this way, I persisted for several nights, and the mosquitoes could only hide in the dark corners, flapping their weak wings.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I heard the people under the wall chasing away mosquitoes with fans, and a triumphant glow appeared on my face. I praised myself for being clever, and felt that those who used fans to chase mosquitoes were really too stupid.</p>
<p>One day, I received a letter from a friend in a distant place. The letter reported the farmers' resistance to taxes in that area, saying that the farmers were resisting taxes because they could not afford them, and the military and police used force to suppress them, resulting in a conflict. My passionate friend, having witnessed such a tragedy, expressed his grievances with pen and ink.</p>
<p>That night, I planned to write a reply to him, advising him to be more rational and not so passionate. Especially in the interior, being overly passionate sometimes only harms oneself and does not help others. But when I sat at my desk, habitually preparing to light the mosquito incense, I found that there was only one coil of mosquito incense left. I rummaged through the drawers, and there were only a few copper coins scattered in them. After a brief consideration, I felt that "poetic flavor" was ultimately not as important as practicality, so I decided to put it under the desk.</p>
<p>I had written half of the letter when I fell into contemplation. I did not believe that I could persuade him. A young man with flesh and blood and emotions, living in a historical tragedy, cannot stand by and watch with detached neutrality.</p>
<p>I was troubled by this problem, and my pen stopped writing. The mosquito incense shrunk circle by circle, and finally went out. I hungrily stared at it, and finally found an answer on it. At that time, hungry mosquitoes surrounded me again, and probably because of hunger, they were especially fierce.</p>
<p>I tore up the written letter, and in the mosquito attack, I told him about my experience with mosquito incense. That's all! I didn't say anything else.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Hypocrisy <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Ye</p>
<p>——Travel Notes, Part Two</p>
<p>Because I am used to living in the city, all my living habits have unknowingly become modern. So when I ran into this ancient city, which was half-revealing the appearance of modern civilization and half-dragging the tail of the feudal era, I felt that everything was fresh, and what appeared in my eyes was the shadow of the old society that had been forgotten.</p>
<p>Before starting the journey, I knew that this ancient city had a kind of inviolable dignity, because it is an area where the inherent Chinese morality is practiced. People who are used to living in the city may forget our inherent morality and offend this solemn holy place. So, when I arrived here, I paid special attention to all the forms, wanting to find the dignity and morality that I wanted to know here.</p>
<p>A friend told me that you will not see the enchanting prostitutes in this ancient city, you will not find the blacklisted compatriots, you will not hear the sound of bamboo cards, and you will not be able to buy the smuggled inferior goods. In short, what you see is solemnity and cleanliness. At first, I trusted my friend's words, because this is an ancient city that practices inherent morality. But after a rainy day, the dream was overturned by the facts, and I began to doubt this ancient city.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>It was the second day I was here. I was walking on the road in the commercial district, and various goods flashed before my eyes. Among the goods, inferior goods often flew into my eyes, which made me pay more attention to distinguishing them. Because I used to be a businessman myself, I still have full confidence in my knowledge of goods. From that time on, the belief in the ancient city in my heart began to waver.</p>
<p>In order to deceive myself, I still thought it was a treacherous merchant's trick, but the things that were jumping in front of my eyes happened one by one. The already wavering belief finally fell into the abyss of destruction.</p>
<p>——Although the enchanting prostitutes did not hang up signs, but from the lively places of the public, they were full of gloomy demon spirit, and the newspapers also had lewd descriptions or reports.</p>
<p>——Although it is clearly stated that those who receive salaries should abide by the law, the clapping sound that scatters in the night sky every night flows out from the homes of those who receive salaries. Knowing the law and breaking the law has ancient precedents.</p>
<p>——The rest, all the morality that cannot be exhausted is destroyed. The solemnity and cleanliness that my friend said are stained in reality.</p>
<p>Chinese people love hypocrisy. In our daily life, the shadow of hypocrisy is everywhere. However, when it comes into contact with reality, the hypocrisy reveals a distressing ugliness.</p>
<p>After spending three full days of solemn life in the hypocritical ancient city, I finally set foot on the journey and walked out of the holy land of the ancient city on a hot afternoon, looking up at the vast wilderness. The depressed heart for a few days seemed to have been liberated and was extraordinarily comfortable.</p>
<h3 id="e205">In Memory <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>It's raining, and the night sky is completely shrouded in deep darkness.</p>
<p>Under the feeble light of fifteen lamps, I anxiously flipped through the pages of a book, thinking, "Perhaps I can find something inside!" However, no! I found nothing, as if I couldn't find the reason for my depression. So, my burning eyes desperately turned away from the pages and gazed at the heavy, dark sky.</p>
<p>In the sky, a dense web of fine rain pillars filled the air, and the night shook with its enormous, clumsy body.</p>
<p>Darkness, darkness, just darkness! I stood up from my chair, feeling stifled, and started pacing gently around the house.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a thought ripple through my mind, then slowly expand into a vivid, real image. It was a face, a familiar pale face, it was Hua! I whispered to myself, a nervous, petite, and easily sentimental girl. On this day last year, I met her in Ming's place. At that time, she was still a lively, talkative girl; but later, she changed, completely changed, becoming so dull and melancholy. Sometimes she would come to my place and gently knock on the door, but when I rushed out to open it and invited her in, she would stare at me blankly with her lost eyes for a while, then sadly murmur in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"No! I can't go in, they can't help me, this dull life!" Then she silently lifted her foot, turned, and left. This startled me so much that I followed closely behind her until she disappeared under the street lamp outside the alley, then I reluctantly turned back. However, I didn't forget the words she said in an excited tone: "No! I can't go on like this, I definitely can't… can't," yes, she can't go on like this! And I sighed.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, my ears were constantly vibrated, as if a low, trembling voice was calling out: "No! I can't go on like this, I definitely can't…" I lowered my head in sorrow, and an unusual impulse made me grab the only old coat from the rack, put on my hat, and open the door to go out. From afar, I could still hear that trembling voice…</p>
<p>The street was calm and quiet, the oily road surface already wet, gently glistening under the intense light.</p>
<p>I walked, heedlessly. On this silent street, I couldn't hear any unusual sounds, I couldn't see any unusual shadows. All there was, was myself, the monotonous footsteps, accompanied by a lonely shadow.</p>
<p>At the corner, I suddenly stopped abruptly. A latent thought was so actively running through my mind, reminding me of what had happened two months ago. Wasn't Hua missing two months ago? Why am I looking for her now? In her small, cramped room, it should be gloomy now; the light, that bright light, might be disappearing in front of the wide window. My heart trembled uneasily, and my footsteps continued moving unnaturally, into the unknowable darkness. …………</p>
<p>The area was becoming increasingly deserted. First, the main street disappeared at the corner, and then the lights were gone. At this moment, everything was gone. Darkness, accompanied by fine raindrops, slanted onto people's faces; however, I didn't feel it was chilling, no! My heart was confused and fiery.</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt my whole body turn cold, and when I regained consciousness, I realized that I was completely immersed in the dense rain. Here, the surroundings were vast, and darkness overflowed.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Starting Work <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>

<p>Half a month later, Old Chen and Old Qian frowned as they did the accounting:</p>
<p>"Hey! Little Li! Come here! See if there are any mistakes!"</p>
<p>"It must be a loss, what's the point of calculating!"</p>
<p>After half a day, they finally finished the accounts, reluctantly.</p>
<p>"My god! We still lost more than ten yuan!"</p>
<p>They sighed, the salary of tens of dollars vanished like a bubble.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Daiyu Visits the Sick"</p>
<p>Xiaoxiang's concubine cannot bear her sorrow. A thousand kinds of thoughts, a kind of shame. It is inconvenient to ask people about it warmly. I wonder if selling jade can cure his body? To avoid any suspicion of love between a boy and girl. I unwittingly forget myself. The distance between two places is like ten thousand miles. One day apart seems like three autumns. The root of the trouble is only due to the fragrant silk belt. I heard that young men in the pear garden are excellent. They want to show off their charm in front of people. Not caring about his father's delicate son. He was beaten. The skin was torn and the flesh was broken, with fresh blood flowing. Father and son are like the wind and the horses and the cows. Several times in the Yihong courtyard. Affectionately asking at the bedside. Before she could open her mouth, tears flowed first. Seeing the bloody purple marks swollen high. She could not help but privately care and nourish him. So she secretly prayed to the gods and Buddhas. It is inconvenient to look at each other and say too much. I can only hide my sadness and worry secretly. It is difficult to caress him and raise your hand lightly. Afraid that. I will tell my maid too much. Although they will become a happy couple in the future. There has not yet been a matchmaker's plan. Vainly cherishing jade and pitying fragrance. Dare to follow the example of Pu Shang and Sang Jian. Loving each other closely but not equally.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Qin Liangyu"</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty was in decline and the country was in danger. Unexpectedly, there was a female general. Qin Liangyu was proficient in both literature and military affairs. Sighing, the heroine did not braid her hair. Tracing back, from a young age, she received her father's teaching. The whole family trained to be a defense force. The brothers shared the same strategy. But she was a female figure who did not give way to anyone. Furthermore, the Stone Pillar sought a phoenix mate. Heroic children and daughters were married. The couple was wise and virtuous. A generation of heroes passed on their famous names. Advising her husband, a good man should fulfill his ambitions. He must, give his life to save the country and establish meritorious deeds. Imagining the battlefield with swords and halberds arranged in battle formations. Military orders are strict with white-pole soldiers. At that time, the situation was chaotic and changing. No one could resist the two of them. Banners fluttered and the drums roared with power. She is worthy of the title of Lady General. Hateful, the court eunuchs abused their power and fell into hell. Qian Cheng died miserably and went to the underworld. Looking at her, she went to the army wearing mourning clothes. She had the ambition to avenge and her wishes were not fulfilled. Fortunately, she was ordered to go to the capital to take over her position. She changed her clothes and took off her hairpins. A red-dressed rider on a peach blossom horse. A green-lined cloud board, a slender willow camp. Seeing her, her brocade robes were stained with the blood of her duties. She galloped on the royal road to be loyal. This is the unique talent of the heavens and the earth. The spirit of the mountains and rivers strengthens this person. Even more envious of her, the bestowed robe praises her and spreads for thousands of years. She received glory and sealed the banner of the country. There are more</p>

<p>There is the filial son who shows great virtue. A bucket of loyalty and righteousness is happy to give up his life. Later, the traitorous thief harbored evil intentions and forcibly dismissed him. The collapse and disintegration of the soil and the painful demise of the Ming Dynasty. But I am, cherishing the past and worrying about the future. I only hope that we can work together to save the soul of the country. Don't just talk about military affairs on paper.</p>

<p>Recently, many news reports of "getting unhappy again" have been seen in various film publications, but the "unhappy" people have never published a word in the newspapers, nor have they made a "phone call," so it is probably not a "rumor."</p>
<p>The latest production of Yihua Company, directed by Xu Suling, starring Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, etc., with Xu Qinfang as a guest star, the drama "Little Sisters" has a song called "Early Xing Le," composed and written by Liu Xuechang, as follows.</p>
<p>Early Xing Le, Early Xing Le, how much is life's lifespan? Don't waste your time, Early Xing Le, Early Xing Le, how many times does the clear wind support the leaves, but the storm sees the false flowers fall, autumn comes and spring goes, seasons change, a year's beauty passes in the blink of an eye, the orioles see the hiding, the butterflies hide deep, there are not many years left, Early Xing Le, Early Xing Le, don't waste your time idling.</p>
<p>After the completion of "The Lost Lamb," due to the implementation of the new plan by Lianhua Film, the director of the film, Cai Chusheng, needs to prepare for his new work "Wang Lao Wu," so Cai's plan to go to the Soviet Union to visit the "Drama Festival" held on September 1 will definitely be realized.</p>
<p>Jin Shan has recently suffered from severe enteritis, so the corridor scene in today's "Night of Joy" has been temporarily stopped, and the scene of the seventh concubine of the governor's house catching adultery in the bedroom is being reshot. "Night of Revelry" is known for its humorous content, and it is expected that the plot of this scene will be exceptionally rich in interest.</p>
<p>The China Film Gengsu Society, founded by Chang Shaobai at No. 121 Juluida Road, French Concession, has been in operation for more than eight months, and the society's affairs have made extraordinary progress and achieved considerable results. Recently, a Gengsu Drama Troupe and a correspondence department have been added, and it is planned to expand further. It is now expanding the recruitment of students and members. Both men and women can join. Send the chapter and postage to be sent.</p>
