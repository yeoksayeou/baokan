<p>（南京）自桑島傳達新訓令、川越大使拜會蔣院長後、頻傳川越將賡續訪晤張外長、對中日調整關係之交涉、作第四次之會談、據聞現時趨勢、尙在兩氏再會見時之預備序幕中、連日日方須磨、我方亞洲司長高宗武、負會見前側面交換意見之任務、十三日高氏與須磨之會談、已初步的提及定期續晤、此後或將有相當時間之交談、冀交涉前途覔得綫索、因此雖屢傳川越行將會晤張外長之斯、至早將於下週方能開始交換意見、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）中日調整問題、業由中日雙方外交人員開始非正式交換意見、俟意見接近、再由張·川·正式談判、據一般觀察、中日調整問題、本為一繁複事伴、非短時期間所能折衝就緒、亦非短時間所能了結、以後交涉、將依現在趨勢、初步談判均由雙方外交人員擔任、再由張·川·作一具體談判、故沉悶之局面、本週內尙不能展開、（十四日專電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日以北平來電詳述長城外日本西展之勢力範圍為其評論之題、謂遠東求取泰西之善意、確然視五年前見减、蓋已不若前之重視矣、惟體面之為一種外飾物、孤立無友之日本、縱然其不法行動乃為或可得到歐洲一部分同情之目的（其始為自衛防俄）所驅使之時、亦不能貿然放棄也、步趨審愼之第二且史有力之理由、則為日本切欲避免對於中國之感受性作最後之蹂躪、蓋此或將促成武裝之爭鬥也、日本縱抱至輕率之情操、第在目前亦不欲在華北激起武裝之干涉、在戰爭情况之下、其足表示日人帝國主義之有限度者、無過於日本發展對蒙政策所取之方針、日人旣未在眞正民族主義復興之蒙人中建立勢力範圍、亦未博得蒙人之信任、今探討蒙人目氏所處之地位、而不能不對之加以憐憫、蓋彼等已為鬥棋中之卒棋、縱稍有所獲、亦確非彼等所有也云云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）英國信用放欵擔保部、與駐倫敦之中國政府代表已成立恊定、規定由英國以信用放欵貸與中國之消息、此間大為激動、英倫每日導報社論所稱、英國對華之放欵恊定、表示英國對中國局勢有重大之關切、並為對日本之一種警告云云、亦引起此間之注意、同盟社今日雖謂日外務省之意見認為英國對華之信用放欵、苟含有政治性質、則日本當加以反對云云、但外務省發言人於今日接見各外國訪員時、表示非常謹愼態度、否認官方曾發表任何文告、該發言人本人亦鄭重聲言、尙未接獲正式報告、不願加以批評云、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）中英雙方已於原則上商妥一種恊定、英國尤以出口信用放欵數百萬鎊貸予中國之消息、已引起此間劇烈之反響、日外務省尙未接得關於此事之正式情報、惟日本政界聲稱、日本殊不欲反對用於促進中國復興事業之建設的借欵、但任何借欵含有政治性質、而足憂亂東亞之安寗、因以危害「滿洲國」之存在者、日本未便袖手旁觀、而不加抗議、凡用於貨幣改革與補充中國軍備之借欵、均須以含有政治性質論、駐倫敦之日政府財政委員富田、刻方假居內國、據稱、貸予中國之任何英借欵、雖將以一部分購辦英貨、餘者大的將用以補充中國穩定匯兌基金云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於中英兩國政府代表、開始談判、俾使中國得在倫敦市塲、覓獲借欵之說、官塲方面、頃雖予以否認、但據半官界人士聲稱、貸欵中國一項問題、各國金融界確在磋商之中、而中英兩國金融界所進行之談判、卽係其中之一部份、此項談判、進行頗為順遂、借欵協定可於本星期杪或下星期初、宣告成立云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）據外電傳、中國政府與英國財政部出口放欵担保部之間、成立借欵協定、然外務省截至十三日為止、尙未接任何公式報告、據日外務省意見、如今次借欵為生產的性質、係以促進中國經濟之自力更生者、則並無反對理由、（十四日同盟電）</p>

<h3 id="c55">太平洋不設防問題 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>在最近一個月中。中日關係的緊張已達到了最高度。而在這遠東形勢的緊張聲中。太平洋的設防問題又由英國提出。引起日美的大討論。這是非常値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>所謂太平洋的設防問題。起源於華盛頓會議。因為華盛頓海軍條約第十九條規定。英美日三國在西太平洋中的若干島嶼。都須維持現狀。不准設防。這些不准設防的島嶼。包括美國的關島。菲律賓。阿留申羣島。英國的香港和在太平洋東經子午綫一百十度以東之島嶼。（澳洲新西蘭不在內）以及日本的千島列島·小笠原羣島·奄美大島·琉球·台灣·彭湖等地·不過這個華盛頓海軍條約。到了本年年底。就要滿期。於是英國政府卽於前數天向日美兩國提議。於最近期內舉行談判。英國主張該的第十九條仍繼續有效。所有英美日三國在太平洋各屬地的海岸防禦及海軍根據地。應以保持現狀為原則。惟原有防禦工事及海軍根據地之巳陳舊不適用者。得加以修改或改造。</p>
<p>英國這個建議。立刻引起了美國的大反響。認英國的建議為非友誼的態度。海軍部長史璜生並發表宣言。謂「軍事設防必須報之以軍事設防。威脅必須報之以威脅」。美國為什麼這樣反對海約第十九條約繼續呢。這是有歷史上的原因的。原來美國最初接受限制太平洋羣島設防的規定。是有條件的。這條件就是日本尊重中國的領土完整。維持門戶開放政策。並接受海軍力五·五·三的比率。因為祗有在遠東均勢的局面下。美國方用不到在西太平洋的羣島上設防。建立進攻日本的海軍根據地。可是現在的情形已完全改變。日本不但退出海會。廢棄五五三的比率恊定。而且還佔領我國領土。破壞我國主權。同時也損害了美國在遠東的利益。因此美國是非擴充海軍重建西太平洋的海軍根據地以謀對付日本不可了。</p>
<p>至於日本的態度。依照過去的立場觀察。是應當贊助英國的建議的。因為所限制設防的島嶼。都在西太平洋方面。因此英美要想遠涉重洋進攻日本。是非常冒險的。日本附近的島嶼雖也被限制設防。但這於日本的利益沒有多大的損害。所以上半年日本在退出倫敦海軍會議時。仍表示願維持海約第十九條約不設防規定。最近日本海軍省雖表示反對從前的限制地域。（卽指離日本本土極近之千島等地）但這也不過是一種裝腔作勢的對案而巳。</p>
<p>在這次事件中。最可奇異的。是英國的態度。依照過去的關係以及海戰的形勢設。英國對於設防問題。是應與美國採取同一的態度的。尤其是從近年英美的友善關係。以及英日的筆下突形勢說。英國更不當提出於日有利的建議。不過我們知道英國的外交。向來是以巧黠著名的。這次的建議也許是一種對日交換某種條件的姿態罷。</p>

<h3 id="c89">長辛店一瞥　（北平特信） <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>本駐軍之演習地，以前，祗於平市近郊之苗家地行之。當時之名稱，為「打靶」。其後，規模擴大，名稱一變而為「演習」。而地點，則由近郊伸展至豐台。再後，規模更大，由豐台西展，至於平漢綫上之蘆溝橋，長辛店。於是，於演習之外，更有所謂「行軍」，有所謂「露營」。降至最近，舉行大「秋操」之期，已正式向我方通知，地域方面，將更加南展，連良鄕縣一併包括在內。以前見日本小品文作家鵪見祐輔之文。其中。因在北京聞及由長辛店方面傳來隆隆之砲聲，對於中國當時奉直軍閥走馬燈式之內戰，致以無限之槪歎。而十餘年後之今日，砲聲雖又隆隆可聞，但其意義，已全殊曩昔。不知鶴見先生如來聞之，更當作何感想。</p>
<p>記者於下午二時，乘四十三次普通客車，由北平前赴長辛店。在途共五十分鐘。沿途風景宜人。出西便門後，菜畦苗圃，一片翠綠，瀰漲接望者，約十餘里。於遍地翠綠上，時有一二紅馬或白馬，點綴其間，蓋均在推轉水車，灌溉畦圃。村中農夫農婦，正在傴僂田間，工作甚忙，於火車駛過時，相率以手遮目，舉首遙矚。氣氛之謐靜和平，令人如置身畫圖中。以意測之，由數十里外傳來之砲聲槍聲，在彼輩聽來，究是爆竹與吾，必常猜疑莫定，或方詫遠方之婚嫁喜慶，何以如此之多，亦未可知。愈思愈令人槪嘆。沿途高梁不多見，而落花生黃豆等類，則到處皆是。鐵路附近，煤舖汽爐舖之類亦甚夥。數十里間，在途與長凡十餘節之運煤車相錯而過者，凡數次。沿平漢綫產煤之豐富，於茲可見。上述種種，皆與沿北寗路至豐台間之各種景况，逈不相同。而較之平豐間令人尤覺心安者，厥有二事。其一，為某國貨之廣告牌略見减少，其二，某國浪人之踪跡，亦不常見。至少在目前情况下，某國對此路之控制，確比對北寗路之控制略小。</p>
<p>車將近長辛店，記者正憑車窗向北眺望時，忽聞同車者高呼：「看！看！看！看！」不絕，急轉身由車窗向南遙望，見遠遠之山脚下，與夫蜿蜒之大道上，正有某國軍隊，分列七八排，向西北行進。蓋彼處適為蘆溝橋長辛店間之大道，其時，彼等正由蘆溝橋向長辛店開去。有一農夫式之乘客，忽向記者發問。「怎麽盡是××兵！咱們自己個兒的呢？」記者無語可答，祗好作一苦笑。但彼仍不放棄其疑問，更用力向記者深追。「先生！先生！嗯？嗯？」此時，記者乃感到莫大之窘迫。幸而，彼忽然以手指窗外，自己高聲歡呼：「您瞧您瞧！那山頭上，您瞧：那不是咱們的隊伍嗎！」記者循其所指望去，結果，辨出立於山頭之隊伍，仍為土黃色制服，並非我國軍隊灰色者，想係記者之目力，較此樸實農夫略好。但為不令彼太感失望計，故亦未忍道破。</p>
<p>二時五十分，車抵長辛店車站。首觸眼簾者為站牌。其上並未如北寗路上於中文英文站名外，更加某國文字。中文之旁，並有國語註音符號。遠遠望去，疑是某國文。。近看方知為註音符號，欣慰之情，眞如通常所說：「非可言宣」。</p>
<p>出站進長辛店街市。此為宛平縣之屬鎭。街為東西街，住戶隔街南北相望。街長約四五里，住戶在千家左右。街東頭之小胡同中，隣近車站處，有郵局一所，除一切與他處習見者相同外，其門首並特貼長紙條一張，上書一代換中央中國交通銀行法幣」。覩此，亦令人起莫名之欣慰。街東頭，有小學一所，而鎭長辦公處亦附設在內。街道東段為土路，中段為鵝卵石者，西段亦為土路，均寬約數丈。街心之兩旁，各有淺溝道，並無積水；溝與住戶門面之間，有高起之隙地約二在尺。其間有時亦設有雜食攤之屬，然大半均坐滿男女老幼，談天消遣，其態度甚覺　閒。街市上行人稀落，有背負蔴袋之駱駝十餘匹，竟臥在街心休息，使道途為之阻塞，而市人似均習以為常，絲毫不見奇怪。洋車夫亦均無客可拉，閒倚車把上，或打瞌盹，或看小報，或抽烟捲者，比比皆是。初秋斜陽照射下，尤襯出一副閒散與鬆弛之情景。</p>
<p>統計沿街店舖，以雜貨舖最多，茶食鋪次之，其餘如理髮舖，飯館，成衣舖之類，在通都大邑處原屬到處可見者，在此則不多見，此蓋由於需要上之不同也。不景氣之風，亦傳至此偏小之鎭市。大减價大贈品之市招，在破落敝舊之店面外，迎風　展。而一按實際，不獨顧客不見，連行路之人，亦不多見。</p>
<p>牆壁之間，老篤眼藥大學眼藥等某國貨物之廣告，亦復亦少，但較之豐台等處，已减少多多。尤其國貨之廣告，如長城香烟，美麗香烟，甚至雙妹老牌花露水等等，亦時時出現牆壁上，此為豐台等地所絕無者。通街行來，最觸目者，厥為屹立雜貨店門。之大學眼藥老篤眼藥等廣告牌。牌高四五尺，上端繪某國人型之老頭子半身像。粗粗計算，全長辛店街市中，此類廣告牌約十餘個，亦可謂為不少。</p>
<p>街之中段，有由廟宇改成之私立中學一所。門面破舊，其上有「私立文藝中學」之校牌，與某某「仙女廟」之橫額併列。門外，坐有乞丐式之人三數，向日搔癢。進鬥為一甬道，甬道盡頭為一宏大神殿，已收壞不堪。殿前方坪上置一丈餘高之鐵鼎。記者在其下徘徊時，兩旁敎室中之學生，均簇簇伸首窗外向記者遙望，　交頭切耳，不知作何語。處此環境下，能安心上課，亦殊不易得。</p>
<p>車站對面之山崗上，有鐵路員工子弟學校一所。建築整齊，佈置幽雅。登崗一望，十餘里方帽內之景色，悉在眼底。其時，正在上音樂殊，歌聲宏大雄壯，由崗上傳開，充溢山谷與人行道之間，所唱者為大路歌。五點十八分四十二次車向北平開動，車上，雖有不斷之槍砲聲，從東北方傳來，但山崗上宏壯之歌　，亦殊不小，令人聞之，於悲壯之中起無限之奮發。（十一日）</p>

<p>黨政組織</p>
<p>之機搆、義大利人民、富於忠君風格、故法西期黨、雖掌政權、仍設虛位君中而不廢、政府組織、一本黨法及各種法律、法西斯黨認為維護以黨治國之權威起見、而絕對不能放鬆之政權、卽以黨的力量、滲入政府的組織之中、使黨政無分界域、融合一體、如檢查新聞、並不於中央黨部另設機關、乃於內閣方面、增設一宜傳部、與內政部、外交部並列、而以黨人主持之、使民衆見之、檢查新聞者、非為黨部、乃為政府、政府一切言行、唯法律是　、法律均以勅令行之、故民衆以為檢查新聞者、實出於皇意、皇意遵從之不暇、焉有遠逆之理、靑年訓練、亦為黨的方面最重要之工作、但並不在中央黨部、特設機關、專司其事，乃於敎育部增設一體育次長、依據黨章、實施訓練、惟民衆因以訓練靑年者、非黨部、而為政府、為君王也、至</p>

<p>（十一）女子敎育</p>
<p>日本女子敎育的目的是在培養優美的婦德，以期造成適當的良妻賢母。在實施方面也是趨向這個月標進打。日本高等女學校有些課程如縫紉，烹飪，作法，茶儀，家庭佈置，敎育學等科都是準傭女生將來出校時可當良妻賢母。該校現有十三屆畢業生，畢業生人數共有五百九十二人：其中已結婚者有一百八十一人，約佔全部畢業生人數約三分之一。</p>
<p>女學校的環境佈置很是淸靜優美。校舍的四週滿植樹木，空地上，鋪着綠茵的草地。校舍內部各間特殊敎室也怖置得非常完備。女生作法室共分兩種：一種是佈置幾間日本式的房間，代表典型的日本家庭；另一種是佈置幾間外國式的房間，頗有西洋的風味。縫紉室亦有兩間：一間是和式縫紋室，供學生學習縫製日本式的衣服；另一間是西式縫紉室，供學生學習縫製西式的衣服。烹飪室面積寬大，灶臺有多只，可供學生實習中式，和式，西式三種烹飪。還有一問染衣室，可供學生實習染衣之用。</p>
<p>（十二）海日本中學校除了高等女學校以外，尙有日本實業靑年學校和日本商業學校。實業靑年學校是一所夜校，每晚授課三小時，附在北部尋常高等小學校校舍內上課。該校是一種補習性質，只有三年的中學程度。課程方面除了日本國語，修身和英文以外，另有一部份商業課程，如算術，珠算，商業知識，商業地理，簿記等科。還有每週四小時的華語，注重上海語的會話和寫作。</p>
<p>商業學校乃是正式的商科中學，訂有五年的課程，每週授課三十四小時。課程方面似括修身，日本國語，數學，史地，自然科學，體育，圖畫，商業知識和商業實習。另有華語一科，每學年每週敎投四小時，注重北平語的會話和為作。在各科敎學中均以培養商業人材為中心。例如：國語中文法作文注重商業應用文，書法注重商業應用字體；數字注重商業算術和珠算：史地注重世界商業史實和商業地理；圖畫注重商業廣告畫。商業知識課程注重簿記，商法，統計，財政等科。商業實習在第五學中舉行，注重進出口商業實習與打字實習。經過此種優良的訓練和實習，該校所培養的商業人村，當可適應社會上的需要。</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼　大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3 id="c181">調整夫婦情感的愛之開發 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>精力豐足的男子是女人最理想的伴侶它有無窮的幸福發揮　孱弱的靑年從速覺悟應該如何去求萬全的對策以解此窘境　發育不全陰萎早洩的確使妻子墮入煩惱的深淵而永難和諧</p>
<p>精力豐足的男子，是女人最理想伴侶。因為男人體質的能力不僅是調整夫婦感情的基本條件，對於性的接合上說，它是操着最自然而最快樂的主動力的，對道種事實的認定，誰敢加以否認。所以求開發愛的智識，是夫婦問無限的重要、從千萬失望的婦女答案中：得到千眞萬確的事實，她們一致認定男人筋肉的力量，是她快樂成功的柱石，所有的男人都應該了解道樁事實，所以體質孱弱的男子，不能創造家庭的幸福，澈底的說一聲，當然不受妻　的歡迎！</p>
<p>多少全世界的著名學者，都在他們的著述裏，很詳細地在叙　利害，俾孱弱的男子有所警惕，要跨進這愛的樂園，應該如何去求對策以解除這僩窘境，這是指着體力不充的靑年而言。</p>
<p>關於男子體力衰弱的原因，簡直有罄竹難盡的描述，實在原因多不勝指，譬如靑年時的手淫行為，假若過度耽溺，就使整個的發育大受阻礙，性器特別細小，而形成發育不全，性能薄弱，婚後陰委，早洩，的確使妻子墮入煩惱的深淵。此外，如在靑年時，意志薄弱，荒淫無度，身染惡性淋病，致控制精液的攝護腺與精囊為之破壞，主宰性能的生殖腺根本動搖。早洩，陰萎，夢一遺，遺精等都是因上述原因而誘起的症狀。故男子不幸罹上述缺陷時，美滿的家庭自然就會生出破綻，結果發生許多意外的爭議，與悲劇。關於這一點，實希望賢明的夫婦們要特別注意，並深加反省？而從速治療。在歐美對於早洩陰萎，無不利用優秀生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』作根本挽救，染淋病者百分之九十以上，用黃色素和伐克辛製劑『安敵淋』以治之，遺精則以『希米脫氏固精片』止之，因效果確實，故多能短期治愈。</p>

<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>應先戒絕手淫止其遺精　鞏固精關為最進步療法</p>
<p>「神經衰弱」這個病名，是由一八八〇年美國紐的城一位醫生比亞得氏開始使用的；為現代文明社會中最普遍發生的一種疾病。在身體過勞，精神苦悶，或是用功過度等之後，多易發現本症；此外，厥為靑年的犯手淫，而使射精中樞過敏，形成夜夜遺精，甚至白天偶一衝動，即吿滑精。本症症主要候：睡眠隙碍，注意散亂，記憶力减退，頭重。此外有時尙有頭痛。倦怠，易怒，暈眩，耳鳴等症狀，以上就是神經衰弱症的槪况，其症狀之多，危害之大，由此也可以推到。</p>
<p>關於本症的根本治法，第一須先戒除手淫，並避免操勞，多欣賞山水等大自然景緻，以開拓心胸，同時注意藥物療法。供治療神經衰弱症所使用之藥劑，普通者為溴素劑，而且含有副作用。且不能連續服用；否則成習慣性，更使病態加重，故已不復為醫家所信賴，最近，多採用鞏固精關法，效力偉大，蓋本症的造成，純為手淫後遺精之故，因此各國　名性病學者如柏林大學生理學敎授得令氏及美國威爾生博士等均利用「看來脫氏固精片」作釜底抽薪的遺精治療，同時藉眞正生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以挽救因遺精所引起的一切衰弱症，故治法較一切為優。</p>

<p>（一）早洩陽萎鑄成惡果</p>
<p>患者邱國勳，年四十三歲，杭州人，主訴——每夜失眠，晨起頭昏，體弱不堪，病歷——年靑時，曾罹手淫惡癖，前後的三年，每日必犯，及後雖强行戒絕，而遺精則由此而起，屢加治療，迄今未愈，結婚後，因房事過度，早洩，陰萎，遂難倖免，因此身體日形憔悴，自四十歲時起，休更不支，現在症——腎部已呈虛弱，生殖腺失却活潑頑强的新陳代謝機能，內分泌也已失正常，神經衰疲，治療方法——投服大量之眞正生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，並佐以電療手術，六七星期後，生殖腺頓形健全，腎部充實，性神經亦恢復固有之敏感，且精神愉快，偶行房事，健全無比，而其夫人。亦因此得孕云。</p>
<p>（二）手淫遺精健康喪失</p>
<p>患者龐梅蓀，年二十一歲，鎭江人，主訴——五年前，在本城某中寄讀時，因同宿舍之同學所誘，用手玩弄性具，以洩出精液為樂，初固不知其害，更受淫書淫畫等迷惑，所犯乃由嘗試而成習慣，不犯則失精頻繁，二夜必犯一，經四五年來，身體頓形瘦弱，面色枯黃，精神萎疲，已無絲毫生氣，頻呈衰弱狀態，旣慚且憂，病歷——十六歲時開始犯上手淫，不到半年，卽羅遺精，先為夢遺，近來已成無夢骨精，即日間稍一用力，精液亦有洩出，無法阻止，奈結婚在即，大為焦急，現在症——生殖腺萎弱，精關不固，內分泌失却正常，洽療方法——先投『希米脫氏固精片』使其止遺固精，再以『生殖素』以促進生殖腺內分泌的健全繁盛，產生有力的新鮮細胞，並施以電療，經二月之治療，所患之症，業已痊愈矣。</p>

<p>— 蔣森投稿</p>
<p>這是兩月前的事情，我躺在床上，怨恨地說：骨痛愈加利害，怎麽辦？勝直動也不能動，最麻煩的是辦公怎樣？不去又得要看經理的醜面孔，同他說骨痛，不能行動，他又不信，去了罷！痛得實在有些耐不住，罷！預備息生意，準定不去……。我正在這樣打算。忽然我的好友劍凡來了。他推開房門就說：「我來望望你的毛病喲，你吿假多日了，你的骨痛好些沒有，倘若不好的話，我這裏有瓶骨痛藥，你可以拿去試試」。我聽了也無精打彩地回說，到今天，還是這樣，現在還有什麽好藥，無非是那些不合科學的鳥藥，吾不要，這時劍却分辯地說「你可別看輕了這瓶藥，這是美國　Dr　Johnston　所發明的骨痛藥，在紐的醫學雜誌上，還載着稱譽這藥效能偉大的文字，並稱牠謂骨痛的聖藥，我的父親也有此病，旋服此不到兩月的功夫，骨痛已好了」。當時我就接受了他的好意，我便天天試着，果然沒有兩個月，骨痛已痊愈了，而且體肢和骨節反比從前未骨痛時好得多，那値得回憶的一頁病榻日記。</p>

<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<p>美滿的乳峯是健的靈魂豐腴的曲線是美的軀壳　國有一百五十個不姙女子求醫藥補救以獲孕</p>
<p>二十世紀的民族，實在再也不能離開健康而能繁殖生存。健康不僅是每個人所不可忽視的問題，而且是每個人應該努力以求其成。在歐美的女子，她們對於健美的常識異常充實她們認淸乳峯的發育為造成健的靈魂，豐腴的曲線為構成美的軀壳，所以能利用種種的科學方法以達到健美的標準。</p>
<p>歐美少女唯一依賴助成乳峯發育的科學藥劑，厥為生殖腺素製劑女用「生殖素」此為奧國生理學大師斯丹那氏所發明，一九三三年被法國亞蘭博士及德國名醫杜亞基氏使用此製劑行之於鼠類，能使雌鼠之乳房增大，此種實騐已吿完全成功。又對於去勢海　亦有同樣效果。所以世界著名的英國美容專家拉克爾氏謂：「女用生殖素」對於女性健美的成就，確無疑義。因為經過無數專家的臨床實騐，先由鼠，海　，家兎，猿猴，及人類等實騐，已獲得確實證明了。其功用不僅能助長乳峯一部的發育，對於子宮，卵管，陰道，外陰部，月經症，姙娠機能，均發生功效，其實騐不祗是肉眼，而在組織學上亦可加以確實瞪明。正常動物若施行去勢手術，生殖腺便發生衰弱狀態，各個細胞萎縮；這時若補充供給生殖腺素製劑時，便發生完全再生現象。故在國外，時有不少失　的婦女，平時不但乳房萎癟，月經不調，同時也有的面容憔悴，完全喪失紅潤嬌艷的容顏，自服此優秀的女用「生殖素」後，完全判若兩人——乳房高聳，月經調整，皮膚與容顏，充滿活潑滋潤的姿態。故意大利的名醫克奧斯氏Knaus時以此製劑推薦於婦女作為駐顏術。記得上年一年中德國名醫杜亞基氏曾用此製劑治愈孱弱乳峯發育不全的女子達二千七百六十四人，月經不調的女子達三千九百四十五人，此外有一百五十個不姙女性服「生殖素」後，經過三百天後，已有二十八人獲得子女，至十四個月後，竟有十分之七計一百〇五人均吿生育矣。</p>

<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>急性淋病，一般人都認為患者就治的絕好機會，照醫學的眼光論斷，的確比較容易根治。不過一切淋病的併發病，如睪丸炎，攝護腺炎，關節炎，膀胱炎，以及頑固難治的慢性淋病，厥為急性淋病失治後的惡果。患者至此地步，雖然比較困難，但如能重視攝生，愼擇飲食，再內服黃色素和伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」則潛居在身體尿道深部的淋菌，無不一網打盡。</p>
<p>德國傑特生博士，根據多年的經騐，將色素擷精取華，並藉科學的研究滲入抗毒菌苗的伐克辛成份，製成此淋病特效藥「安敵淋」，該藥的勝過一切，由於透膜殺菌的名符其實，毫無刺戰胃腸腎臟之弊。實為男女急慢性淋病及併發病的對症特效藥，可與梅毒六〇六媲美一時。</p>
<p>患者徐美　住本埠甘司東路一五九弄，女性，彼受丈夫的傳染，患有淋病性白帶。余乃用黃色素和伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」治之，並外用「療帶靈」以止白帶，不到一星期，小便卽不感覺疼痛，共服「安敵靈」兩盒，「療帶靈」一盒，卽吿根治，（編者按：婦女白濁，應兼用「療帶靈」則功效較速）</p>

<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>鴉片的為害，能影響整個民族的生存。不僅是這樣，能夠使人類的繁榮起了尖銳的暗礁。所以各國施予人民的禁煙法律，各有不同。可是列強為了使此煙毒迅速撲滅之故，除了處罰以外，尙利用科學方法，以衝破戒煙的難關。國聯會的衛生組，是代委員國謀福利的唯一組織。的確一切的設施，所有的方案，均經過嚴裕的審查，所以各國政府也都奉為金科玉律不若其他行政議案及經濟制裁等等，遭各國反對，今年國聯會在日內瓦開三十二次大會時，由主席Bounde　M.D.博士提出培補戒煙法，用「生殖素」為主藥，輔以注射「育維賜保命」，五十二國委員國一致通過，此戒法深合染毒者的體肢，原因由於煙癮者全身，尤其是生命源泉的生殖腺，都被毒盤據，原有的抵抗力盡被麻醉，服此後使體肢增強，新生的精液足以抵抗所染的煙毒，既經損傷，概被復元，故得安全戒絕，此法立經英法美各國採用，大凡是因吸食鴉片而被捕的囚犯，均經一一用此法使之戒治，行之三月，煙犯大為减少，今年德國亦經採用，被捕之煙犯，百分之七十因用此法而被戒絕，再者英國囚犯之被戒絕者，為數當在百分之八十以上，法國當在百分之九十以上，美國當在百分之火十五以上，吾國許多醫院，亦在使用此法，余於去歲冬季查得日煙民之被治者，為數亦不不在少數，當在百分之七十五以上云云。</p>

<p>大凡商人之目的。利而已矣。然而同一利也。有見共大者。有見共小者人見解之各別。固不可同日而語也。吾國商人。向來有一惡習慣。往往甲創一業。乙慕而效之。丙又羨而追逐之。未幾若丁若戊若己若庚辛壬癸。莫不起而羣相爭競。甚至影射牌號。摹仿商標。敗壞商人道德而不恤。觸犯國家法網而不顧。若是者。互相傾軋。互相排擠。勢必至兩敗俱傷。一蹶不振而後已。卽不然。循人故轍。步人後塵。雖有微利可圖。而其所收獲。等於蠅頭。蓋可知也。此見小者之效也。而見大者則不然。</p>
<p>夫捲烟一業。創自外商。人以其便於取携。便於燃吸也。咸樂用之。不數年遂風行一時。而我國固有之阜烟水烟。乃慚歸淘汰。至於今。僅不絕如縷而已。而經營旱烟水烟業者。早已大受其影響。然而業旱烟水烟之商人。當其時。旣不知合羣策羣力。以圖補救。而海內巨商碩賈。亦鮮有激昂慷慨。以相當之旗鼓。與外商對壘而抗戰者。坐使外商捲烟公司。攘奪吾人之利益。飽吸吾人之脂膏。而日益肥壯膨脹。馴至碩大無朋。此誠可痛心者也。吾華商智識之卑淺。力量之微薄如是。允堪扼腕。然而簡氏兄弟則夐乎遠矣。</p>
<p>簡氏兄弟。蓋富有愛國愛羣之思想者也。早年經商於南洋。能吸收外洋之金錢。歸而振興祖國之商業。其高掌遠踱。識見之超，固高人一等矣。當南洋兄弟烟草公司之經始於上海也。其時國人適有抵制外貨之舉。夫欲抵制外貨。非吾國貨足以與外貨相頡頏。不可。欲吾貨之足以抵制外貨。非資力足與外商相伯仲。不可。簡氏知此。於是刻厲奮發。慘淡經營。資本愈增而愈厚。貨質亦愈進而愈高。努力鞭策。雖其間屢瀕竭蹶。而再接再厲。百折不回。排萬難而卒底於成。遂使外商公司。不復能稱雄於我國。其堅毅之力。有如此者。</p>
<p>且也自南洋捲烟公司興。而華商各捲烟公司。亦風起雲湧。相繼而俱興。華商捲烟公司。旣盛極一時。而外商公司。遂因而氣勢漸銼矣。</p>
<p>回憶未有南洋公司之前。外商公司。獨立稱雄於海上。其獲利之豐。不言可喩。然而其時行銷各地。雖略有捐稅之輸。然國家之收入。則微乎其微也。自南洋興。而捲烟稅遂蒸蒸日上。凡吾華商。旣樂輸恐後。而外商公司。亦因而不能例外。故以今視昔。民元以前。捲烟稅之收入。不啻滄海之一粟。恒河之一沙而已。今則捲烟之稅。遂為國庫收入之大宗。國家旣受公司之利益。而其餘直接簡接之工人商入。受其利益者。更不可以摟指計。至於補助敎育文化。救濟水旱偏災。慨捐鉅欵。盈千累萬。而不稍吝惜。此允為愛國愛羣之本旨所流露。而見之於事實者也。鳴呼。若簡氏兄弟者。誠商界之魁傑哉。茲因南洋公司總發行所之遷移。而有捲烟特刋之作。爰敷陳臆見。以為之序。</p>
<h3 id="c192">白金龍與我 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 萬乃鴻</p>
<p>香烟在商業上的地位，好像牠的勢力到越佔越大了，這並不是我過分的誇張，實在那種蓬勃的情形，我們不難在任何報紙上都可以見到的，尤其是在這國貨爭先的年頭兒，牠之所以如此受入歡迎，假使要追原而究故的話，更不妨從一絲想像中得到無上理解的，簡單地說一句，香烟對於人生的關係，是愈永久愈密切的。</p>
<p>牠不僅是交際塲中的必需品，茶餘酒後的點綴劑，最怪牠還富有開發人們思想的魔力，所以文人常愛拿烟來做他的帮辦，牠能嚮導你，比嚮導社的摩登女郞都來得溫存，貼體，有趣。</p>
<p>自家學會了吸香烟，資格雖不算老，可是也有短短三個年頭的歷史了，而且從沒有和牠斷絕過一天關係。</p>
<p>噴出了一口淡淡的靑烟，像霧雲般環繞在週空，眼睛凝視着心靈里所想像的一切，於是美妙的景子都有秩序地盡在其中了，不過像這種神仙般的樂趣，唯嗜烟的朋友始能領會。</p>
<p>咱吸的是項刮刮的頭等國貨「白金龍」，從吸起到如今，整整三年都是牠，牠能做到安慰我的使命，所以我對於牠的印象却非常深刻，現在讓我簡略地把牠的品行，性格，作一個感想式的寫在下面：</p>
<p>「白嫩而挺秀的烟枝，如少女之苗條，金黃高貴的烟絲，吸來適口而淸香，旣妙且美，可作孤獨之佳侶，能補益思想，增進健康，且價簾物美，較之舶來勝出百倍，誠國貨之佼佼，今特介紹，希大衆都與之締交，定能受益無窮」</p>
<p>聞南洋烟草公司欲遷移吉地，顯以後有更新的進展，更大的動力，為國貨放一綫燦爛的光輝，則國家幸甚，民族幸甚。</p>
<p>寫完此篇，我更感謝「白金龍香烟」給予的助力（於大北）</p>
<h3 id="c193">人類生活與捲烟 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 蓉舫</p>
<p>人類生活在物質銷費方面，主要的是糧食棉布與絲綢，在精神方面是文化，信仰及藝術；因為精神和物質，相互的組合起來，便會促使人類生活趨向於更高的階叚——高級化；所以我們在兩者之間不能偏廢任何一樣。</p>
<p>此方像本色的棉布，是未接受精神感化的單純的物質，等到它織上了條紋或印上了圖案之後，它便美麗了，好看了，它便適合了人類生活的雙重需要，它便會敎調皮的小弟弟小妹妹們所愛穿了；醫如像麥粉，若果只是做成了實心的大饅頭，它也是沒有感受精神力量的產物，等到由上等技師用藝術的手腕，做成了種種花巧的點心之後，它便投合了小姐少爺們的胃口了，我們由此可以知道，精神和物質在人類生活上是相互並重的——雖然也偶而有人把精神生活看得比物質更重要，寗可為適應他們的高級信仰而吃些糙米飯，這我們只能把這個歸納到別一問題上去說了。</p>
<p>從人類生活的雙重需要上，我們就想起了捲烟，捲烟這東西，雖也被有些人看做別無意義的消耗品，而其實在人類生活的意義上，它正是物質和精神組合的特種產品，我們若果將捲烟一天到晚的常做飯吃，那固然不成事體，但是在適當的時間與塲合裏，它實是一種絕不可少的必需品，你只須隨便在什麽地方留心一下，你就能明白，在捲烟的存在後面它也自有它之所以存在的堅强的理論基礎。</p>
<p>捲烟有國貨與外貨之分，而實際是並無差異的，有人以外貨捲烟較勝國貨，想來其人必一定以為外國的月亮，比中國好的原故吧？</p>
<p>在國貨捲烟的製造廠當中誰也知道南洋兄弟烟草公司是中國最具信譽及歷史的一家，所以他們的出品，無論品質裝璜等等，超出在一般的捲烟之上，那當在每個入的想像中都是如此的。</p>

<h3 id="c196">夜遊記 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 陳明章</p>
<p>（集南洋兄弟烟草公司出品牌名）</p>
<p>「大喜」果然如的，和她的二個妹妹，——「雙喜」和「四喜」，携着手，姍姍地來臨，我的臉上堆下笑靨，跑過去迎接着她們，為了要使我的愛人感着滿意和快樂起見。我拍着馬屁似的獻媚的說：「今夜天氣很晴朗，我們到遠些的地方去玩一下可好」？僥倖得很，承蒙她三姊妹的靑睞，是一口的應承了。並且我看她們的意思，很高興而且有趣，這使我更感到愉快。連忙打了一個電話，到龍華「飛機」塲。吩咐他們放一隻「飛艇」來，我們飛揚在「地球」上面了。</p>
<p>在天空中，我們賞玩着天上的景緻，因為是八月半的時候，所以月兒也特別來得「光明」。看去隱隱的可瞧見內裏有二個「兄弟」，拿着「金斧」同砍着一棵大樹，旁邊還有一隻大貓」兒臥着，正在賞玩高興的時候。天空中突然靂霹一聲，飛來五十支大號的「白金龍」及十支小號的「白金龍」。和「紅金龍」突出了眼，張開了嘴，欲吞噬的狀態。我們都駭極了。嚇得動也不敢動。祇催着駛機人，駕駛得些快我暗暗的忖着，一定是天宮怕我們「洩漏天機」（？）。</p>
<p>「飛艇」飛駛得很快，一忽兒已到了華北了。「大長城」，和「小長城」像大小蛇一樣，灣曲的臥在高山上，山上有「高塔」，「寳塔」矗立雲霄。塔裏正做着京戲。鵲橋相會，有「喜鵲」能變成橋，「七星」燈，「梅蘭芳」掛正牌。看的人很多。票價祗賣「三角」，「八角」二種。</p>
<p>飛過長城，向東駛去，過瀋陽，長春等地，便是出人參的長白山了。山脚邊，見有數「百雀」「金鹿」往來馳奔。山項險峻，在最尖的地方有一棵「花王」，據說是「美女」變的，因此開出來的花也很嬌艷。</p>
<p>因為明天早農還須照常到「銀行」裏去辦公，所以囑咐司機人，由原路駛回。</p>
<p>一走下飛艇，就覺頭昏混，在附近的一爿烟兌店裏買了一匣「小聯珠」香烟大家分着吸。</p>
<p>此决華北之行。實足廢了一夜光陰，但是所得到的却也良好，使我深深的感覺到華北確實是一個「富國」。然而江山依然，人事全非，「愛國」的靑年們，怎樣的去拿回來，完成山河的「統一」呢？</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份一致反跌、因洋麥報價微跌、且傳社會當局、市面如是高抬、影響民食、此後將有嚴厲之處置、故開價時、人心卽定、業內外之多頭、紛紛脫手、形勢有急轉直下之象、各月份較前日、而跌三六七分、迄至下午開盤、人心遂趨和　、各月份交易甚暢、市面又回小一二分、此後如禁止外運、一般囤戶、勢必恐懼、市而或可從此安定矣、現麥市面、因客戶扳售、特高貨反提高一角、中次平定、開山東麥五元七角半、潁州麥五元七角、五河麥五元六角半、次六角三分瑤灣麥五元六角、次五角八分、沙河　麥五元六角二分、鹽城麥五元五角三分、漢口麥四元七角半、道人橋麥五元三角、次二角半、廣水麥五元四角一分、次三角六分、駐馬店麥五元五角半、襄河麥五元二角、又五元一角、由福新辦三千包、阜豐辦五千包、申大辦二千包云、</p>

<p>近日芝蔴市况、須分實銷抵空二種觀察、故趨勢一時難以捉摸、洋莊實銷不動、市僅平平、然抵空頗勁、且來源不湧、致乏供應、故仍覺緊漲、現貨毛蔴銷塲有寗波福州紹興本街等採辦各蔴千譜包、行情較前市無甚出人、前途或有大漲小回之勢、黃豆去路轉見懈淡、榨油廠辦胃已見呆滯、昨祇辦去郯城豆一十百零九包、漢口車豆五百包、其餘汕頭福州本街等銷化亦少、計成交各路豆一千二百餘包、行情暫居高定次平之形云、</p>

<p>— 栗系</p>
<p>我國唐朝永泰初年的時候，（距今一千一百七十二年）九月間有一名叛將呌僕固懷恩的，造了種種的謊語，煽動了回紇吐番兩族狄人，的同黨項等部落，總共有三十多萬人到我國涇州等地方搶刦擄掠。他們聲勢浩大，乘勢直犯國都相近的醴泉等地方來了，朝廷在倉猝的時候來不及防備，大為震恐，於是一面先行戒備，一面趕緊呌子儀聚兵涇陽抗敵。但是子儀的兵，在這個時候僅有一萬多人，試想拿萬多兵要抵敵三十萬兵，在事實上是不可能的。並且子儀剛頭兵到涇陽的時候，早已被敵兵重重的圍住了。子儀在這個時候，態度非常沉靜，一些也不慌亂，吿訴全部將領，只要嚴密的守住，勿許胡亂出戰，凑巧正在這樣危急的時候，叛將僕固懷恩得暴病死了，回紇同吐番為了爭權的緣故，彼此不能一心了。子儀看見機會已到，於是馬上派一位李光續的充任使者，去見回紇。</p>
<p>李專使奉了命令，一直跑到敵人回紇的營中，見了他們的頭兒—酋長，開口道：</p>
<p>「我是郭主師—派來的，同你們商議商議，大家合力一同去打吐番，好不好？」</p>
<p>酋長聽了這話，臉色變了，態度也忽然侷促起來，像心裏起了極重的疑懼，但還勉强裝作鎭靜的說道；</p>
<p>令公（當時中外的人尊敬子儀的稱呼）的確在這裏麽？你眞是令公派來的麽？呵呵！你不要說瞎話啊！你不要拿令公來嚇我們啊！如果令公眞在這裏的話，我們先要見一面，才相信。</p>
<p>李專使聽了這話，便退出敵營，回到自己營中，把同回紇酋長所說的話詳細的報吿一番。</p>
<p>子儀得到報吿，勇氣百倍，决定要單身直往敵營去見回紇領兵的頭兒。馬上派人和敵人約定相見的日子。這時他的部下大小將領齊來勸阻道：</p>
<p>回紇是夷狄的人，不講道德，不懂信義的，您是國家的大將，同國家的存亡有絕大的關係，尊重自己的身子要緊，千萬不可冒險單身去見他們</p>
<p>子儀道：一人生世上，要重信用，要愛國家。我同回紇己經的定，我必須守的；國家有急難，我必須捨身報國。並且如果我不去，反顯得我郭子儀膽小，懦弱無能了，現在偌大的中國，反受狄人的壓迫，甚至敢把重兵侵犯我國的近畿，所以目下頂要緊的是發揚我中國人愛國的勇氣，怎好示人以弱、呢？我是一定要去的。」</p>
<p>部下將領見子儀去志甚堅，無法阻擋，只得跟他同去，想法保護，不料子儀又攔阻道：「讓我單人去見，諸位為國珍重，準備後死，為國復仇，不要同去」話纔說完，就上馬揚鞭，單槍匹馬，飛奔回紇營中去了。路上放哨兵丁，見了這樣情形，就互相傳喊：「令公來了　令公來了！」</p>
<p>回紇的頭兒雅格路，得着了信，十分驚疑，領了大小頭目，預備好了弓箭，站在營前，等候子儀，沒有多大工夫，看見子儀已到，他們就把箭架在乾上，頂備要故、子儀不慌不忙，走近回紇營前，先脫去了盔甲，放下了槍矛，挺身直入。</p>
<p>這個時候，回紇大小酋長，都驚異到了不得，說道：「令公眞的來了」。就馬上下了馬，拋了弓箭，齊向子儀行禮。子儀也下了馬，同雅格路招呼，臉上現出很溫和而又莊重的樣子說道：「我中國待遇你們向來極優厚的，你們對於我國亦向極恭順的，為什麽僅僅聽了懷逆的謊話，便失了咱們兩方的感情，並且帶了兵馬，深入我國近畿，辜負了中國對你們一向的恩惠。况且懷逆這漢奸，非但反叛　亂，甚致因為要造反連他的老娘亦拋棄不管了。這種不愛國不孝順的逆賊，同他合作，你們有什麽好處呢？現在我單槍匹馬隻身前來，是我看得重你們，知道你們還可以聽話，你們如果不拿這話為然，甚至把我殺了，我雖不能再來抵抗，但我的部下是不怕死的，他們一定會同你們拚命。」</p>
<p>雅格路聽了子儀一番「理正詞嚴」的話，不覺就軟化道：「懷恩這人，實在欺騙我了，他說：「可汗（狄人稱中國皇帝）已經駕崩，令公已經作古」我聽了這個謊話，所以敢大膽的到來，現在情形原來完全不對，他已死了，我亦已明白了，我們再敢同您打仗嗎？」</p>
<p>子儀覺得情勢已經順利多了，知道狄人素來不懂大義，極貪小利，並且回紇這時正同吐蕃失和，就用「以夷制夷」的法子來籠絡他道：吐蕃這决到來恐怕非為打仗，實在為搶掠財物罷？你如果不信，你想他們所搶的牲畜牛馬何以聚集起來，竟有幾百里的長呢？這就是志在搶刦的明白證據了。但是這許多的牛馬牲畜，是上天賜給你們的。只要咱們不打仗，聽我的話，一同去打吐蕃，將來打勝之後，這許多的財物就可以送給你，你們想想上算不上算呢？」</p>
<p>雅格路說道：「我們聽了懷賊的瞎話，對上國進兵，已經很對不起上國，對不起令公了：請你饒赦我的罪罷！我們一定出力帮你的忙。」回紇說完，隨手拿酒就請令公同各會長暢飲，盟誓，决照的做事，兩無後悔。</p>
<p>另一方面吐蕃止在躊躇，現在聽得他們兩方已經訂了誓的，知道自己力量太單薄，趁在黑夜辰光，就偸偸的逃去，不敢再同上國來反抗了。</p>
<p>令公得到了這消息，豈肯放過他們，立刻約同回紇的兵，一齊向前追趕，沿路斬的俘的計算起來，的有六萬多人。同時又設法把他們從前俘虜去的中國百姓，救了出來，他們逃命要緊財物當然來不及搬走了，令公取得財物就照的送給回紇，作為酬賞。回紇感激上國的寬容，於是就服服帖帖的把兵全行退出中國的境地去了。</p>
<p>從這次打仗，可以知道子儀的智謀怎樣的靈巧，膽量怎樣的勇壯；並且知道狄人的進迫，並不可怕，只要全國一心，研究方法來對付他們便得。所可怕的只是一盤散沙，為狄所乘：等到受人欺侮，已經後悔不及了。唐朝這一次的打仗，歷史上竭力的稱讚他，後人盡力的美談他，這就是所說的「郭子儀單騎見回紇」一段的故事呢。</p>
<h3 id="c217">法拉第（lichael　Faraday） <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 李任</p>
<p>—一個自己苦學成名的大科學家—</p>
<p>法拉第是英國的物理學家兼化學家，他發明誘導電流，電解定律等，是科學界的一個有名的實騐家，他的出身是很淸寒的，他事業的成就，完全由他的刻苦耐勞，好學不輟，纔能得到圓滿的收獲，他得到物理學家兼化學家的榮譽，决不楚偶然的</p>
<p>法拉第生於西元一七九一年，是他父親的第三個兒子。他的父親是一　鐵匠，因為體弱的緣故，不能常常作工，所以家境很是困苦。法拉第起先在公學裏讀書，　十三歲的時候，他的父親就就把他送到一爿書店裏服務，被派做送報童子，過了一年，他就脫離了書店，到一爿釘書作裏　學徒，以七年為期，到二十一歲卒業。法拉第在這七年學習期裏，他碰到所釘的科學書籍，尤其是電學一門的書，他必定很用心去閱讀硏究。所以不久他就自己製造小玻璃瓶，和小管，後來並且能製造蓄電的長圓　，雖然買的人不多，可是一個鐵匠的兒子，能够製造東西，講求電學，實在是一椿極不易的事情。</p>
<p>有一天，法拉第聽到格致家達登氏（Mr.　Tatum.）在某處演講物理，講期每隔七天舉行一次，入塲券每决收金二十五分，因為學費太鉅，决不是一個釘書學徒所能應付的，他就去和他的哥哥羅佢（Robert）商量，他的哥哥很贊成他弟弟的志趣，願擔任每次的人塲券費。法拉第第一步的志願，就因為他的哥哥的帮助而成功了。正在這個時候，法拉第店裏來了一個精於繪畫的夥計，無意中他也就學會了繪圖的技術。達登的演講，自是名不虛傳，法拉第列座旁聽，也是格外的用心，凡是講帥所講的，他必定是一一記錄起來，回到店裏，再用正楷謄淸，到畢業時樍成四卷，交給他本店的業帥。後來法拉第又聽到化學家達變　SirHumphry　Davy）的講演，受了感　决志舉化學。</p>
<p>一八一二年，法拉第釘書作的習業期滿，他就寫信給達斐，說願從他學習化學，可是这次達斐並沒有答應他。法拉第暫時不能得到導帥，他就把格爾文流電學（Gatvanic）來自修。起初用鎚薄的白鉛七塊，大小的如銅幣的一半，都拿銅鍍迴，在每一鉛塊的中間，用石鹽水浸透的紙六層夾護着，以作發電的池，卽用以化分為鎂硫强礬的本質。法粒第以這樣淺陋的方法，試騐博大精深的電學，雖沒有多大的心得，可是他自己已感到化學的深味了。</p>
<p>後來法拉第轉到一爿法國人開的釘書店執業，店主是一個英京有名望的商家，他並沒有子女，他和法拉第商定，如能在店裏工作，始終不離，百年後願把店業給他，法拉第也應允了，可是這店主的脾氣太壞，法拉第不肯屈辱。不久便萌大志了。</p>
<p>一天傍晚，法拉第忽然接到一封達斐給他的信，信中的他明日去面談，並且已經答允他，在院裏謀一位置。法拉第看完了信，快活得不亦樂乎。明日一淸早，他就到皇家藝院去拜見達斐，達斐就吿訴他，已經給他在院裏謀上了一個司機的缺，每一星期，給薪金六圓，職務是專管揩抹機件，和演講的時候接送各種用品到演講臺，其餘的事就沒有了。法拉第得了這個美缺，他就向店主辭退，從此他就在皇家藝院內服務，不但常常能聽到名貴的演說，並且可以作種種化學上的試騐，都是不要費錢的。</p>
<p>法拉第進了院，就决定三個立身的原則；第一，他認為學院是他安身立命的地方；第二，把書籍當為進修的好友；第三，努力得到不朽的名譽。他本了這三個原則，就成功了他偉大的志願。</p>
<p>法拉第跟達斐試騐各種物質，經過不少的艱險，起初發明蘿蔔製糖術，和化合淡綠二氣接觸，時常有爆發的危險。有幾决他面上罩的玻璃假面具都被轟碎了，好在還沒有損偽他的肉體。這樣經過了七個月，達斐就領他到法國，瑞士，意大利，和維蘇威山等處遊覽，凡是遇到美術院，藝學院，他們必定是進去玩賞一番。法拉第在旅途的時候，有苦有樂。苦的是一路替達斐做僕役，精神上感到不少的困頓；樂的是他一個沒有出京城！三里外的靑年，能够作萬里的漫游；並月能和當世知名的學者文人相往來，眞是畢生最快樂的一樁事。</p>
<p>法拉第二十四歲那年，回英國來，那時他的歲俸已增到美金五百圓，升做試騐室的助敎。當達斐試監碘氣，綠氣的時候，他也十分注意，達斐創製保險燈，對於礦中工人，大有裨益，法拉第襄助的功勞，也不小。法拉第初撰講義六章，專論物質的牽合力和同性的辯義抽繹法，曾什本城博物學會中，當衆演說，得到聽衆不少的　佩。同年他又撰化學論一篇，詳論炙藥（卽腐蝕藥）的黏質。明年，他又撰講義六章，論及煤氣和金石諸質，得到不少的好評。這樣經過了七年，法拉第的化學巳經卒業。他的著述共　二十七章，又有鋼鐵合質發明書一本，另有講義一章，論及二種新發明的碘炭混合質，和他試騐所得來的新發明碘炭輕化合的新質。</p>
<p>一八一二年六月十二日法拉第和他的情人撒拉（SarahBarnard）結婚，結婚以後，精研化學，製造更富，經過二十年後，他的聲譽已遍傳遠近，被選為英國皇家學會會員。初撰化學製煉術，講義十二章，跟着撰化學精理六章，又撰電傳磁質之學六章，此外更撰初學須知等書，在各學堂演說有十九年之久。同時烏列奇有五家實業學會，聘他做主講，亦經過了二十年。後來政府因築造燈塔，安設浮標，特命他做工程顧問專員。法拉第當演說的時候，他常常當衆試騐，以證明他所講的實在。阿勒勃脫親王（PrinceAlbert）也常率世子來旁　。法拉第先後所作化學論說共一百五十八篇。尤以電學發明諸說三十章為最佳。格蘭斯登（Dr.Gladstone）稱這些為英國的傑作，眞是不錯的。</p>
<p>法拉第長初發明，是在蒸取石腦油的時候，測得氣質受壓力，能凝成流質的原理。跟着父發明磁生的電，和以綫通電的方法。電信，電話都發源於此。</p>
<p>法拉第成名後，對於母親極盡孝道，對於已死的父親，也常常記念着，並且對人說：「我很歡喜鐵工，因為他很有功於世人，我的父親也是一個鐵工，我從沒有因為自己是鐵工的兒子以為羞恥的，」法拉第四十九歲時，腦力頓衰，經他夫人撒拉的勸吿，同到瑞士　病了四年，才得恢復他平常的試騐工作。</p>
<p>法拉第在試騐室工作，每天淸晨入院，晚間十一點鍾就寢，除每天用膳外，從沒有浪費一分一秒的寳貴光陰。到了老年身體眞是衰弱了，他才停止授課。那時，全世界都紀念他的功勞，各國學會都送獎牌給他，尊他做會董。法皇拿破崙第三授他責秩。法京大博覽會，給他頭等獎牌，女皇維多利亞，特在離宮賜宴。又允她的丈夫阿勒勃脫親王的湊請，特賜法拉第府第一所，眞是光榮　。</p>
<p>法拉第七十一那年，記憶力幾乎已完全喪失；但是他對於燈塔，電機，汽機等一切報吿，仍由他自己來執行。</p>
<p>一八六七年八月二十五日，法拉第在書室的椅上死去，遺囑不要葬在威斯明斯敎堂，混在一般達官名士裏。他只要葬在高門塚上，（Highate　Cemetery）並目遺囑不要立碑坊，但揷白石一塊，上書某人的墓和生卒月日便可，法拉第死的時候年已七十三歲。</p>

<h3 id="c218">「林琴南」 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>寒光著　中華出版</p>
<p>林琴南先生的文字，曾給我一個深刻的印象，尤以茶花女遺事，附掌錄，和京華碧血錄一書為最。我之能粗通文字，能寫點文言文，未始非先生啟發之功。和梁任公先生奔放前進的文字與思想，對我有同樣陶冶的價値。</p>
<p>當然，時代是在邁進的，秣先生的思想和文字，是多少落伍了。即以此書而論，向圖書館裏借閱的人，異常之少，可為明證。但林先生雖被人遺忘，却始終禾被我或忘。——這也許是我一點的頑固呢！不久，我仍在請他的魔俠傳呢？——但我在這裏至少可以提供先生的兩點：第一是他的人格，——一種中國「士君子一的人格——他「少任氣，人目為狂者，極富血性，先生是儒而　者，——這點和章太炎先生有相似處。—他有至情，譬如他的同情，——不限於其同時之人的周濟——他的愛國，他的憂世之懷，他不斷的作四旦之鷄」，——　生自擬——都是極可稱許。而為今日學者所寡見其儔　。其在今日國運蜩螗之下。我個人是極其嚮往於提倡　種「士君子」的流品的。其先生譯述之功和一生努力之忠勤，堪為吾人矜式。他　譯外藉凡百四十餘種，——連同短篇合計不下二百餘種——又詩畫之成就，皆有可稱，即逮今日，他的譯品如附掌錄，撤克遜英雄略等，尤作為中學國語文科補充讀本，萬有文庫錄採者又不下七八種，影響雖異，迄未稍衰。</p>
<p>所可惜者，先生自民國十三年逝世後，十餘年之中，可資為紀念的文字，除小說月報鄭振鐸先生一篇「林琴南先生」一文及本書外，幾無其他可見　所以致此者，在舊者詆其文旣不雅，又不能盡俗，——章大炎先生語—因文見道，無與於新思想，——梁任公先生語——在新者則咎其迻悻二三流作品，且多失卻原意，以是兩無所當，先生之功，湮沒不彰，亦可傷已！</p>
<p>本書特論平允，尤能跡先生之用心行事，一可稱也；為先生唯一正確的　生紀載，使先生之行誼文章，不致湮沒不彰，二可稱也。然不能已於言者：其一為本書的體例太不完整了，其目次為：一·略歷；二·思想與熱誠；三·文學界的論評；四·翻譯；五·創造；六·文舉價値與功績；七·結論。以文學界的論評列於第三，未免先後失當；又結論可略。其二，為本書草率從事，內容頗嫌蕪雜。譬如略歷一章，旣於序中不滿意於陳衍先生之傳，則當另作一首尾畢具的傳文，乃僅掇拾無關經歷的瑣言，未免殊忽。先生逝世僅十年，其平生行誼，散見於文字及人口者甚多，當錄以存之，用為知人論世之資。又叙翻譯一章中，多以　　　代譯書，旣言小說月報載錄，則小說月報非難得之書，當可査明寫入，以求完善。至於結論，則更支離太甚。其他前後壘見者，持論待商酌者，如論先生詩極成功，我個人至少不敢同意。——所在多有，雖非急就之章，——作者序言作於十年前——却多疏陋之處。</p>
<p>略書所見，望作者予以致訂，能多集其遺墨，附錄年譜，蔚成完璧，跋予望之。</p>
<h3 id="c219">疑古派與社會史派 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 宜夫</p>
<p>中國近年來的學術界，化一極可喜的現象，卽是對於古代歷史肯下一番切實硏究的功夫；對於古代學術思想；肯作一番切實整理的功夫。一派是疑古，一派是社會史家，他們的立塲雖有不同，但對於古史古書，不肯作盲目的信仰，把牠重新估　，用科　實證的方法，掃　一切從前陳舊的見解，以　闢出一條新　來，這是完　相同的。</p>
<p>疑古的　派，可由錢玄　氏起，因他本人廢了姓而　稱疑古玄同，卽可概見。　埋頭苦幹，而近時最得成　者，實以顧頡剛氏為首。</p>
<p>在北平有禹貢學會，考古　社等等之組織，其精神，　實際，都是可以致無限的　佩的。</p>
<p>社會史家的一派，當推郭沫若氏為首，他的「中國史代社會硏究」一書，是一部有名的鉅著。其後如讀書雜志派，雖和郭氏意見不同，但也可歸入此類。而陶希聖之創辦「食貨」，切實地做整理工作，也是卓絕的社會史家的硏究精神。</p>
<p>不管是顧頡剛們的疑古派，郭沫若們的社會史派，　　派同為中國學者之進步的硏究精神是無疑的。為了　倒舊　學而站在共同戰綫上，在各觀上看來，也是必熱的趨勢。</p>
<p>疑古派將已成的經書古　的年代，由作者的决定，而搖動舊國學的殿堂；社會史派是對於中國文化作各種的硏究，想强調的推翻沒根據的臆說。</p>
<p>但這　派雖得看為站在共同戰錢之上，而因信仰之不同，硏究方法之不同，往往引起了牴牾和扜捍。</p>
<p>前者為舊學的學者之集合，而後者卻受了新興的社會科學之陶冶。同時社會史派以他們中間立塲之不同，屢起熱烈的論戰，疑古派則只是埋頭工作，雖也說有意見上之不同，而互起爭執，不過無理論的目標，只以自己學術上的成果為依歸，道是兩者不同的地方。</p>
<p>當然咯，學術以討論而愈發皇，因兩派之立塲不同，每有牴牾，最近劇氏之論文，卽是疑古派對於社會史派攻擊的表現。其題目乃是國立北平研究院史學集刊第一期所發表的「禪讓傳說由墨家所起論」。</p>
<p>所謂禪讓，不用說是指堯傳舜，舜傳禹這種不傳子而讓賢的話，這為讀儒者之書的常識，為什麽到近時成了大問題呢？</p>
<p>第一，以為儒家所言之最偉大的堯舜帝位的傳說，全是和儒者相對立的墨子一派的創作。</p>
<p>第二，郭沫若在古代社會研究，以為唐虞之禪證，不過是母系制度時　族長選舉制的誤會。</p>
<p>以上兩者都對　國學下新的批判，予以特別見解，想推翻過去空洞的誇誕的傳說是相同的顧氏之言，對批判舊國學為常然之事，自無問題；但對批判郭氏之說，便含着極複雜的問題了。</p>
<p>郭氏之古代社會硏究，為社　史派發生時代的著作，故每為後進學者所集中批判。取如同屬社會史派者，為二　年前讀書雜誌的同人所反對者，已是很多。關於母系氏族社會，婚姻制等諸間題，由中日之古代史學者，訂正郭氏之說續出，郭氏自良也曾改正了幾點。</p>
<p>可是顧氏的攻擊，並小在於郭氏個人，實可說是對於社會史派全體。</p>
<p>原來禪讓傳說，是否為古代社會制度所傳的一種史料呢顧？氏以為這是墨子的尙賢主義，卽為平等主義宣傳的文化工作，不過是起自儒家，而為法家歪曲，道家所變形的一種物語。把這物語而當做為古代史的史料，他是完全非難着的。其禪讓傳說為由墨子所起的論據，大略如下：</p>
<p>在世襲制度儼然存在的時代，是不能產生天子讓位於匹夫的事實的。在這時代，如詩書或銅　的銘辭所表現的，多是世襲制度的禮讚。但到孔子的時代，世襲制度的崩壞，業已開始，孔子自身，也正是在古制度與新傾向之間惱着矛盾的過渡時代。而孟子之反對世官與荀子公羊傳之反對世襲，則更為明白。這個世襲制之反對，成為尙賢主義的導火綫的是墨家。他們看漁夫廚工和百姓同有能力，對高官以及天子為一樣的稱號，墨家之理想為一集團，選巨子為首領而實施民主的方針，共唱禪讓說者，卽是想實行於自己的集團內的。墨家之說一經流行，戰國時代的君主們，也有想自己實行禪讓的表現。孟子荀子皆為儒家們，而亦採取墨家的尊賢主義。可是對君主地位受動搖之禪讓說，還是被一般所歪曲而又否定的。如法家對行禪讓的堯舜，排斥為有背於君臣之　；而道家則極崇拜不受禪讓的野人而經蔑堯舜。惟在漢代，官學統一，這禪讓說就在溫和的正統化漢人所作的堯典裏，成為歷史所書的事實了。　（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c220">從女子壽長男子壽短談起 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 無次</p>
<p>據最近美國國勢調査局局長奧斯精的硏究，以統計法證明女子壽命長於男子。他說美國白種女人的平均生命為六十三歲，男人的平均生命為五十九歲。奧斯精這種研究的基礎，據說是根據着一九三〇年編造的國勢統計。這種統計法是否精確，自然還是一個問題，假定可靠的話，比了一九〇〇年所調査的美國人的平均生命——女子五十一歲，男子四十八歲——就要增加十歲以上。</p>
<p>中國的人口，至今還沒有精確的統計，那末，男人與女人的平均壽命，自然不在「話下」。不過推測起來，大致是不會比美國人長壽的。連年的天災人禍，社會的枯竭，生計的維艱，往往會把一個壯健的「好漢」磨折成一個骨瘦如柴，奄奄一息的「病夫」在這樣的情境之下，要照他們或她們不「半途夭折」，怎麽辦得到呢？就拿比較幸運點的人來說，又大都荒淫無度，沈溺酒色，過着沒有規律的生活，結果也是自戕其天年的。</p>
<p>這不過就一般的情形來說。至於男女之間的壽命，現在雖還沒有人統計過，但也和美國一樣，是女子長於男子的。為什麼呢？男女之間除了生理上的不同外，其所接觸的社會環境也有很大的差異。單就生理來說，五十歲以上的女人，性的要求，似乎就不甚强烈，而男子呢，則在七八十歲還有要討小老婆的，雖則「討小」的理由是為了傳宗接代，可是如果撇開了性慾，這「代」將如何接法？講到人事，中國一直是男性中心的社會，現在雖說女權高張，可是「社會柱石」們到底是男子佔絕對的多數，卽在家庭之內，女子也是居於附庸地位的。精神的磨損，體力的消耗，自然都比女人為多，能够活到五六十歲，已經算是長壽的了，而女人的活到七八十歲，那是不算稀奇的，上海西郊有一個呌什麼社的，前兩天舉行了一次紡織比賽，得第一名是一位呌「蓋妹妹」的，這名字雖像一個十六歲小姑娘，然而她的芳齡，卻已經八十了。</p>
<p>照這情形來看，封建勢力越濃厚，男女之間年齡的差別也越遠，美國雖是一個先進文明國，但女人的地位，是終究要遜男子一籌的，所以女人的平均壽命要比男人長四歲。而中國的此數，大致總要在十歲以上，以男性為中心的社會，而男性的壽命卻如此地短促，實在不是一個好現象。</p>
<p>但問題並不在男女之間的差別，而在如何平均地增高人類的年齡。</p>
<p>人總是有求生之慾的。而養生的方法，在運用人類所有的智慧去與自然抗爭，這其間最重要的就是醫學的進步，與生活水準的提高。有了進步的醫學，能够短促人類壽命的疾病也無從猖獗，而提高了生活的水準，更是儘可能地去撲滅疾病的發生。但人類雖有這樣的智慧，而殘殺的劣根性却永遠不能剷除，所以一方面有保障健康的設備，一方面又製造自相殘殺的軍火，倘然人類將歸於毀滅的話，這毀滅之路却是自己走上去的！</p>
<h3 id="c221">橫墟 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 玉路</p>
<p>淸晨了。都市是給幾個做早市的工人，小販，和在馬路上掃街的蠢傢伙呌醒了的。</p>
<p>現在，是午前五時過一點了，在南方的初秋，這麽個時候，天已帶着白濛濛的銀光，在閃耀着那剛舖好沒多久的黑亮的柏油路了。三幾個拉「夜班」的黃包車夫，打着瞌睡，有緊沒要地用兩支有力的臂膀壓着車槓，拖着疲乏的脚步，走着。不時的有三兩汽車，很敏捷的，無聲的從他們身上駛過，驚醒了他的假睡，馬上又想起趕着到「西堤」去接早班輪渡泊碼頭。因此，他們唱着「半邊鷄，一壺永利威……」的，拉着車子朝南走去了。</p>
<p>正是這時侯，一行幾人的收買舊貨的「收買佬，」每人都挑着滿滿一担的舊貨，在「下九甫」那新馬路拐一個角，向西走去了。他們走得很整齊，也很靜默，像是在淸早，怕騷擾了誰似的。</p>
<p>他們走了不多路，便又碰着了幾個「行家了。碰到了熟人，照例打着招呼</p>
<p>「你早呀！生意好呀？」</p>
<p>「你早，」答了一句客套，然後又都是那句這年來才慣用的家常：「不成呀！這幾年生意比較從前更難做了！」</p>
<p>他們這樣的生活已經是慣常的了。一天，最多隔天，便要把收來的貨色趕淸早拿到「橫墟」來出淸，不然，老本給壓死了翻不了身，那就賣了祖宗田也不够來蝕的了。</p>
<p>橫墟，是他們的定了的聚集所。每天，在天沒完全亮以前，便做收進賣出的生意，一直到天亮了便散。這是一個很奇怪的習慣，很像「舊貨見不了天」是一句眞眞正正的俗語。因此，這橫墟的歷史，在這城市裏是算得上够老資格的了。雖然曾經給取締過幾决，但都不過換個地方又算事。</p>
<p>現在的地方，是在「西來初地」那裏的一個黑暗的，甚麽廟宇的門前。</p>
<p>燈還在亮着啦，人頭在鬼火般的燈光底下聳動着。討價還價的聲音，是用手指頭和算盤子來代替的。情景活像偸偸摸摸的秘密生意·一隊新的「行家」參加了進來，情形顯得活潑的了，手的揮動也增加了聲威，買的和賣的都很熟練地講着許多「行」裏的術語。這個討價要一「揸住！」那邊「客仔」不願出，只還一個！「三個七錢二！」雖然價錢相差太遠，可是兩不相讓，半個「斗零」也不願加。…</p>
<p>「鄕俚，不要死硬頸，賣了就輕了膊頭，省得担來担去，」</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「識貨買貨，這裏不像「雙門底賈古董，」價錢老實，那裏能够相差太遠！」</p>
<p>「好了，好了！加你二分四，賣就賣，唔賣就算！」</p>
<p>「生意靠熟客！好，好，好！」</p>
<p>「這樣，一件貨物又在黑暗中換了主人。</p>
<p>當然，也有人在這見爭吵的。像一些「外行，」第一次趁橫墟，不熟行，不懂事，「船頭慌鬼，船尾慌賊！」又要貪便宜，又怕上當。於是，你一句，我一句，大家又喊又罵起來了。</p>
<p>天，慢慢地給染得半天通紅了。燈光在太陽光底下失去了它的火焰，於是，橫墟也顯得零落了。滿擠擁的人，都一下子散光了。天亮轉來時，這廣塲又重歸了沉寂。地下散沓着不少殘跡，一天的淸晨又開始來到人間了。</p>
<p>在人的記憶中，橫墟佔的位置是很微小的。如果是有綫人家，便算是老廣州，也不會知道。</p>
<p>（附註）西堤，下九甫，四來初地，雙門底，都是地名。揸住，是五的意思，這裏指「五元。」七錢二，是「一元」。斗零，是半角錢。二分四，是「三分」一角錢。「雙門底賣古董，」是一句俗語，是開大價」的意思。</p>
<h3 id="c222">陌生了祖國底人 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 藍佩</p>
<p>——里行記。</p>
<p>「在唐山到處都是士匪嗎？」</p>
<p>表妹好奇地從我打聽着一點關於中國底消息。她底家庭，圍繞着她底朋友們都從不曾向她提到過中國。偶然，從馬來文報上她可以看到一小段關於中國底事情，那就使她糢糊地意識到中國確是一個野蠻的充斥着士匪底地方。</p>
<p>「並不——那是一塊好地方！士匪，那祇是深山裏底事，咔嚦由裏不也有士匪嗎？總之，唐山並不如同你知道的：一個怕人底地方。在那兒，假如你到去過，你將要無限驚奇呢！也許你就不願意回來了，像我一樣，我不是三年未回來一次嗎？」我極力解釋着。</p>
<p>表沫不信任　狡譎地陰笑着說：「唐山，吃番薯底（註一）！</p>
<p>「番薯，也許不是好食的東西。不過，唐山也有洋房呢，比這兒的還要堂皇，巍峨——你沒見過照片嗎？那麼電影你總看過了，那就是唐山呀！」</p>
<p>「咦，那是，」表妹大笑起來。「那是上海呀，你當我不知道的！」</p>
<p>我幾乎有點惱怒了，我沒有想到過表妹對祖國竟是這麼陌生。不明瞭祖國底情形，是說得過去，然而連祖國底最主要的地方也不認得，那簡直是過分不合理了。「僑生，荷蘭敎育法！」我忿忿地用中國話駡了句。</p>
<p>「上海就是唐山呀！你讀過世界地理沒有？那裏面有一頁書這樣寫的。上海，世界大城市之一，中國底經濟文化中心。——另外，廣州，你知道的吧？北平，天津，都比這兒好，汽車——隨便你說什麼吧，什麽都有的。就是有一樣，那兒沒有像你這樣穿「沙籠」底人。」</p>
<p>「也許，上海就是唐山，不過——」</p>
<p>表妹又大笑起來，彷彿這樣是一樁有趣味的事。</p>
<p>「不能的，」我暗暗地說。「像這樣，有什麽辦法。她簡直要不認是中國人了。她們，那些成千成千數同表妹一樣受着荷蘭敎底僑生。」我忍不住大聲喊起來：「不能的，你不能那樣看輕唐山，你終究還是中國人——你能够說你是荷蘭人嗎？」</p>
<p>「咦，我也沒有說過我是荷蘭人呀——我還是問你好：表哥，你不是說過上海是唐山底嗎？那麽：上海眞是不是電影上的樣子呢？」</p>
<p>「唔——當然；嗨，上海是唐山底這句話並不是我說的呀，那是眞的這樣——這樣是很笑話的呀！你這樣說。」</p>
<p>我開始感覺荷蘭底奴化敎育法底威力了。</p>
<p>「陌生了祖國底人！」</p>
<p>我低聲地忿忿地說。</p>
<p>註：「吃番薯底人」，成語，卽笨拙之意。</p>

<p>— 川川</p>
<p>—生活記錄—</p>
<p>急急地晃動着的筒管和宏龍宏龍震憾了車間的機器的喊聲，並不能防碍她的思想。她一邊注視着由小筒管轉到大簡管的紗子，接着斷頭；一邊就為着幸　的將來打算。想到甜蜜的地方時，心也笑雛了。</p>
<p>以後，她雖然仍舊離不掉在工廠里生活，離不掉每天在機器面前站立十二小時，去呼吸灰塵和花衣，但也許，別家廠的先生「領班」不會像現在的這個先生可惡，也許，別家廠的工錢會比這里大一點；這些還不必去顧慮安，只要不被那狠心媽媽賣給四十八歲的大亨做小老婆，也就够樂了。</p>
<p>她要同他——她的情人，——在楊樹浦那邊住一個亭子間，兩家頭同時上工，同桌吃飯。沒有人駡她，沒有人把她工錢統統拿去，使她縫不起一件好一點的衣裳。</p>
<p>在甜蜜的幻想中，時間很快的溜去了，轉眼紅燈就亮了，工入們關了車，一齊向飯間湧去。回來時，她找到那摩溫，對她設她要簽字了，那摩溫是一個大好老，沒有追問什麼就答應了她的要求，並且允許代她找領班簽字。</p>
<p>兩點鐘的晨光，她向車間里的小姊妹告別，特別向那摩溫說了幾句感激的話，袋子里放着領班先生簽了字的紙頭，拍掉了頭上和衣服上的花衣，就跨進人事部去。</p>
<p>她只看了那紅面孔的科長一眼，頭就急忙埋下了，輕聲說；</p>
<p>「先生，我簽字。同時，把領班簽了字的紙頭送到他的面前。，</p>
<p>「跳廠嗎？」像從一個緊閉着的瓶子里迸出來的聲音。</p>
<p>「不是！」她趕忙說，又釘了他一眼。</p>
<p>他的手在翻動一本厚厚的簿子，那一對老鷹般的眼睛，却斜斜的瞟着她，那兩片血紅的厚嘴唇歪着，把聲音放得和緩一點：</p>
<p>「為甚麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我不做了。」她仍舊輕聲說；</p>
<p>「哼！不做了？不准簽字，」她的聲音又粗莽起來，頭也埋下去，注意看簿子去了。</p>
<p>她的臉脹得通紅，她想向他聲辯；停工是自己的自由，但接着她馬上軟了，她想到這樣做是沒有好結果的，她的工錢一定會完全充了公。只好壓低了嗓子，和軟地說；</p>
<p>「先生，我要……她說不下去了，要這樣說也說不出口。</p>
<p>「甚麽？嫁入嗎？」</p>
<p>她只好點頭。</p>
<p>「嫁給啥人呢？」科長把手撑在檯子上，　着一邊肩頭，追問。</p>
<p>嫁給誰與你有甚麼關係呢——她忍不住這樣想。但為了錢，她不能不忍受，不能不回答。</p>
<p>科長又催問了，她只好答道：</p>
<p>「周志英。」</p>
<p>「哼，就是細紗間的磅紗嗎？你們軋姘頭，不准簽字！」</p>
<p>她是乎哭出來了，她想抓住他，狠狠的給他幾記耳光，但還是忍受了，不過她的聲調中已經帶着憤恨。</p>
<p>「先生，我簽字，算工錢給我！」</p>
<p>科長的眼睛又注意着簿子了，凶凶地說：</p>
<p>「回去，呌家里來人證明，扯謊就工錢充公！快出去！」</p>
<p>她全身的肉都暴跳起來。她咬住嘴唇，死了地釘了他幾眼，拿着他寫好的門票，就憤憤地冲出了房間。</p>
<p>在廠門口，周志英等候着她，看者她那付哭喪着的臉，他楞住了，放下了笑臉。</p>
<p>「他不准我簽字，你想怎麽辦？搭存工在一道，我可以拿到十二塊錢啦，現在。現在……」她哭了起來。</p>
<p>對方的回答是一聲失望的長嘆。</p>

<p>「你呢？她忍住了淚問他。</p>
<p>「我簽了，得了十三塊錢。」</p>
<p>「他為什麽准你簽呢？」</p>
<p>「我自己不簽，他也要開除我的呀，你看別個車間的磅紗，不都換了女工嗎？</p>
<p>他們倆不的而同的把視錢注視着高大的紅色廠屋，對這束縛了他們五年的工廠投去了最後的一次憤怒。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Foreign Ministry: New Instructions to Kawagoe, Ogihara Relays from Shanghai to Beijing, Stagnant Situation Yet to Unfold, Japanese Foreign and Navy Ministries Hold Meeting, Conferring on Countermeasures for Negotiations with China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ogihara Bisei, Third Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 14th by China Aviation Corporation airplane, visited Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, reported on something, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane in the afternoon of the 15th. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As a result of yesterday's three-minister meeting of Japanese officials Arita, Terauchi, Nagano, etc., Ambassador Kawagoe has already been instructed to comply and carry out diplomatic negotiations. After receiving the order, Secretary Ogihara of the Japanese Embassy in China flew from Shanghai to Beijing at 8:00 this morning, handing it over to Ambassador Kawagoe. It is said that an important consultation will be held with Ambassador Kawagoe and Consul General Suma at the Consulate General in Nanjing. (14th Chinese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Secretary Ogihara of the Japanese Embassy arrived here by plane from Shanghai at 8:00 this morning and immediately met with Ambassador Kawagoe to convey the new instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on the report of Director-General Kuwashima. (14th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Kawagoe conveyed the new instructions from Kuwashima and paid a visit to President Chiang, it has been frequently reported that Kawagoe will continue to visit Foreign Minister Zhang to conduct a fourth meeting on negotiations for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. It is reported that the current trend is still in the preparatory prelude to the two men meeting again. Suma of the Japanese side and Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department of our side, have been tasked with exchanging views on the sidelines before the meeting. The meeting between Gao and Suma on the 13th has initially mentioned a scheduled continuation of the meeting. Thereafter, there may be considerable time for exchanges in the hope of finding clues to the future of the negotiations. Therefore, although rumors have repeatedly circulated that Kawagoe will meet with Foreign Minister Zhang, the exchange of views will not begin until next week at the earliest. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of Sino-Japanese adjustment has begun with informal exchanges of views between Chinese and Japanese diplomats. Formal negotiations will be conducted by Zhang and Kawagoe after their views are close. According to general observation, the issue of Sino-Japanese adjustment is inherently complex and cannot be resolved or concluded in a short period of time. Future negotiations will follow the current trend, with preliminary negotiations being handled by diplomats from both sides, followed by specific negotiations by Zhang and Kawagoe. Therefore, the stagnant situation cannot unfold within this week. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 4:30 pm on the 14th, Kuwashima, Director-General of the East Asia Bureau, invited Toyoda, Director-General of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Navy Ministry, and Section Chief Hoshina of the same bureau at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hold a liaison conference between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy. Director-General Kuwashima reported in detail on the local situation, including the activities of Britain and others centered on Sino-Japanese negotiations, and then, based on the suggestions of Japanese officials stationed in China, such as Ambassador Kawagoe and military attachés Kita and Sato of the Army and Navy, exchanged various opinions on future countermeasures for Sino-Japanese negotiations. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 pm. (14th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry convened an important staff meeting at 4:00 pm today.

<h3 id="e2">The Times Comments: Japanese Influence Outside the Great Wall: Japan Does Not Want to Provoke Armed Intervention in North China for the Time Being, the Mongolians Are Pitiful and Have Become Pawns in a Game of Chess <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Times today used a dispatch from Beiping detailing the scope of Japan's westward expansion of power outside the Great Wall as the subject of its commentary, saying that the Far East's pursuit of goodwill from the West has certainly decreased compared to five years ago, as it is no longer as important as before. However, as a kind of external decoration, isolated and friendless Japan, even if its illegal actions are driven by the purpose of possibly gaining some sympathy from Europe (initially for self-defense against Russia), cannot rashly abandon propriety. The second and even more powerful reason for proceeding cautiously is that Japan is determined to avoid a final trampling on China's sensibilities, as this may lead to armed conflict. Even if Japan harbors the most frivolous sentiments, it does not want to provoke armed intervention in North China at present. In a war situation, nothing better represents the limits of Japanese imperialism than the policy Japan is pursuing in developing Mongolia. The Japanese have neither established a sphere of influence among the Mongolians who are genuinely reviving nationalism, nor have they won the trust of the Mongolians. Now, examining the position of the Mongolians, one cannot help but feel pity for them, for they have become pawns in a game of chess, and even if they gain something, it is certainly not theirs.

<h3 id="e3">Britain's Credit Loan to China: Japanese Foreign Ministry Temporarily Remains Silent, Has Not Yet Received a Formal Report, Expresses a Very Cautious Attitude, Sino-British Loan Agreement May Be Announced at the End of This Week <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The news that the British Credit Loan Guarantee Department and the Chinese government representatives in London have reached an agreement stipulating that Britain will provide China with a credit loan has caused great excitement here. The editorial in the London Daily Telegraph, which stated that Britain's loan agreement to China shows Britain's major concern for the situation in China and is a warning to Japan, has also attracted attention here. Although Domei News Agency said today that the Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that if Britain's credit loan to China contains political elements, Japan should oppose it, the Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed a very cautious attitude when receiving foreign visitors today, denying that the government had issued any statement. The spokesman himself solemnly stated that he had not yet received a formal report and was unwilling to criticize it. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news that China and Britain have reached an agreement in principle on a type of agreement, with Britain providing China with several million pounds in export credit loans, has aroused fierce reactions here. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has not yet received formal information on this matter, but Japanese political circles claim that Japan does not want to oppose constructive loans used to promote China's revitalisation, but any loan that contains political elements and is sufficient to disturb the peace of East Asia, thereby endangering the existence of "Manchukuo", Japan cannot sit idly by and not protest. All loans used for currency reform and to supplement China's military equipment must be regarded as containing political elements. Tomita, a Japanese government financial commissioner stationed in London, is currently temporarily residing in the country. It is said that although any British loan to China will use a portion to purchase British goods, the rest will mainly be used to supplement China's exchange stabilisation fund. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Although official circles have recently denied reports that representatives of the Chinese and British governments have begun negotiations to enable China to seek loans in the London market, semi-official sources claim that the financial circles of various countries are indeed discussing the issue of lending to China, and the negotiations being conducted by the financial circles of China and Britain are part of it. These negotiations are progressing smoothly, and a loan agreement may be announced at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to foreign telegrams, a loan agreement has been established between the Chinese government and the Export Credit Guarantee Department of the British Treasury, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any official report as of the 13th. According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, if the loan is of a productive nature and is intended to promote China's economic self-reliance, there is no reason to oppose it.

<p>(Tokyo) According to news received here, Japan's economic activities in North China have shown significant progress recently, especially in the textile industry. The Chinese-run yarn factories in Tianjin and the surrounding areas used to number six, but four of them have now been sold to the Japanese. In addition, there are not a few Japanese trading companies setting up factories in Tianjin. There are currently a total of 240,000 installed spindles, 880,000 under installation, and another 110,000 planned to be installed in the near future. Once all are completed, Japanese yarn factories in Tianjin will have a total of 530,000 spindles. Japanese merchants also have 10,000 looms in Tianjin. In addition, Japanese textile merchants are also greatly expanding in Qingdao, and by next spring, they will have a total of 600,000 spindles and 22,000 looms. It is also heard that Japanese merchants are currently planning to acquire a Chinese yarn factory in Jinan with 30,000 spindles. Although the Shandong Provincial Government is opposed to it, it is feared that it will be of no avail. It is estimated that this transaction will be completed soon. It is generally expected that the Japanese yarn factory industry in North China will have great development in the future because it has the following factors: (1) Chinese raw cotton has made great progress in recent years, and its quality is not far from that of American products, but the selling price is 7-8 yen lower than in Japan; (2) Yarn factories in Japan must pay various taxes, but in North China, in addition to land tax, there is only a simple tax, that is, high-quality cotton yarn is taxed at 11 yen per bale, and coarse cotton yarn is taxed at only 8.5 yen per bale; (3) There are no restrictions on output in North China; (4) There are no fixed restrictions on factory work and working hours; (5) The labor cost in North China is only one-third of that in Japan; (6) Electricity is also 20% cheaper than in Japan.

Other provinces and cities have only submitted brief telegrams without sending detailed resumes and candidate lists. Furthermore, according to the law, the review of all candidates who have already been reported must be based on the membership lists of various professional organizations and other required registers. However, only five units—Anhui, Shanxi, Henan, Suiyuan, and Xijing City—have submitted these lists and registers to the general office, making the review quite difficult. Therefore, the general office is now urgently telegraphing all provinces to urge them to submit the required documents.</p>
<p>Number of Citizens</p>
<p>After the general office organized and reviewed the reported numbers of villages, towns, neighborhoods, or joint guarantee units, populations, and citizens from various provinces and cities, it found many errors and omissions. As a result, many reports were returned for correction, and the back-and-forth correspondence delayed the process. Recently, only nine provinces—Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Henan, and Sichuan—were deemed to have no issues. Their figures have been successively disclosed in the general office's tri-daily publication. The remaining provinces and cities, including Anhui, Shaanxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and Nanjing City, are still under review and calculation, and their figures cannot yet be considered definitive.</p>
<p>Special Elections</p>
<p>In addition, various elections for Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, independent professions, overseas Chinese, Mongolians and Tibetans, and the military are all being actively carried out.</p>
<p>However, because the election offices in these regions have not yet submitted complete reports, the extent of their progress is still unknown. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Issue of the Pacific Non-Fortification <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>In the past month, the tension in Sino-Japanese relations has reached its highest point. Amidst this tense situation in the Far East, the issue of Pacific fortification has been raised again by Britain, sparking a major discussion between Japan and the United States. This is something that we should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>The so-called Pacific fortification issue originated from the Washington Conference. Because Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty stipulates that the UK, the US, and Japan must maintain the status quo on certain islands in the Western Pacific, and are not allowed to fortify them. These islands that are not allowed to be fortified include Guam, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands of the United States; Hong Kong and the islands east of the 110 degrees east longitude meridian in the Pacific (excluding Australia and New Zealand) of the United Kingdom; and the Kuril Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, the Amami Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and Penghu of Japan. However, this Washington Naval Treaty will expire at the end of this year. Therefore, the British government proposed to Japan and the United States a few days ago to hold negotiations in the near future. Britain advocates that Article 19 should continue to be effective. The coastal defense and naval bases of all British, American, and Japanese territories in the Pacific should maintain the status quo in principle. However, existing defense works and naval bases that are outdated and inapplicable may be modified or renovated.</p>
<p>This proposal by Britain immediately aroused a strong reaction from the United States, which considered Britain's proposal to be an unfriendly attitude. Secretary of the Navy Swanson also issued a statement saying, "Military fortification must be met with military fortification. Threats must be met with threats." Why does the United States oppose the continuation of Article 19 of the treaty so strongly? This has historical reasons. Originally, the United States initially accepted the provisions restricting the fortification of Pacific islands on the condition that Japan respect China's territorial integrity, maintain the open door policy, and accept the 5:5:3 naval power ratio. Because only in a situation of equilibrium in the Far East would the United States not need to fortify the islands in the Western Pacific and establish naval bases to attack Japan. However, the situation has now completely changed. Japan has not only withdrawn from the naval conference and abandoned the 5:5:3 ratio agreement, but has also occupied our country's territory and undermined our country's sovereignty. At the same time, it has also damaged the interests of the United States in the Far East. Therefore, the United States must expand its navy and rebuild its naval bases in the Western Pacific in order to deal with Japan.</p>
<p>As for Japan's attitude, judging from its past stance, it should support Britain's proposal. Because the islands whose fortification is restricted are all in the Western Pacific. Therefore, it is very risky for Britain and the United States to cross the ocean to attack Japan. Although the islands near Japan are also restricted from fortification, this does not greatly harm Japan's interests. Therefore, when Japan withdrew from the London Naval Conference in the first half of the year, it still expressed its willingness to maintain the non-fortification provisions of Article 19 of the Sea Treaty. Although the Japanese Navy Ministry has recently expressed opposition to the previous restricted areas (i.e., referring to the Kuril Islands and other places very close to the Japanese mainland), this is just a show of force.</p>
<p>In this incident, the most peculiar thing is Britain's attitude. According to past relations and the situation of naval warfare, Britain should adopt the same attitude as the United States on the issue of fortification. Especially from the friendly relationship between Britain and the United States in recent years, and the British-Japanese strategic situation, Britain should not have made proposals that are beneficial to Japan. However, we know that British diplomacy has always been known for its cleverness. Perhaps this proposal is a gesture to exchange certain conditions with Japan.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the issue of lowering the age for Japanese youth to serve in the army and navy is under consideration by the relevant authorities. Currently, the prescribed military service age in Japan is twenty years old, but it may be lowered to eighteen or nineteen years old. It is said that this proposal was put forward by the Ministry of Education, and the army and navy ministries are currently studying it. The benefits of lowering the military service age are approximately as follows: (1) to strengthen national defense, (2) to avoid interruptions in the careers of those enlisting, (3) to achieve social maturity earlier, and (4) to provide young people with more effective physical and mental training. According to those who support this plan, the Soviet Union announced in August of this year that it would reduce the compulsory military service age from twenty-one to nineteen. The reason the Soviet Union adopted this method is nothing more than to enable Soviet youth to obtain comprehensive physical development and to complete their military service early so that they can engage in various social occupations. According to the provisions of the Japanese Military Service Law, all healthy Japanese men between the ages of seventeen and forty should serve the country at any time when called upon by the state. However, in practice, physical examinations are only conducted at the age of twenty, and those who pass the examination are enlisted for service. Those who pass become active-duty soldiers, with a service period of one year and ten months for the army and three years for the navy. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, approximately 850,000 young people are examined each year, of whom 85% are already employed, as most have been working since leaving school at the age of fourteen. At the age of twenty, it can be said that it is the most important period of life, because no matter what kind of work they are engaged in, their skills will inevitably undergo significant development at that time, and many people have to bear the economic responsibility of their families. Therefore, once enlisted, not only is their original career interrupted, but the lives of their families are also affected. Moreover, from the standpoint of national defense, the mechanization of modern armies and the increasing complexity of military strategies make it appropriate to start the training of soldiers earlier than currently stipulated. The Nichinichi Shimbun once published an argument that prolonged engagement in a certain occupation before enlistment often harms the intellect and comprehension of those enlisting, making it difficult for them to grasp the mysteries of military art.

<h3 id="e57">Approaching Political Season: The Hirota Cabinet Faces Numerous Difficulties. Administrative Reform Issues Unlikely to Cause Fatal Wounds. Even If the Cabinet Changes, Its China Policy Will Ultimately Remain Unchanged. <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese political season has now arrived, and various difficult-to-handle political issues are awaiting resolution. Currently, all eyes are focused on the fate of the Hirota Cabinet. How can the unprecedentedly large budget of 3.2 billion for the next fiscal year be passed? How can the massive plan to increase taxes be accepted by the people? How can the state-run electricity scheme be implemented? How can the plan to reform the administrative structure be reconciled with reality? All of these are major difficulties for the Hirota Cabinet. Reducing the 3.2 billion budget is not permitted, so the burden on the people must be increased to make up for the shortfall. The recently announced planned tax increases have met with strong opposition, but there is a tendency to implement them. Regarding the electricity issue, the relevant authorities are currently drafting a compromise plan to satisfy the opposition of electricity entrepreneurs. This issue, like the budget and tax issues, is unlikely to cause a cabinet crisis, but it may become a difficult issue during the Diet session next spring. What requires extreme attention at present is the plan for reforming the administrative structure, which is firmly advocated by both the army and navy. The opposition points out that the plan will lead to the following results: (1) dictatorship, (2) wartime conditions, and (3) centralization. However, the supporters believe that the plan will strengthen the cabinet, make it easier to implement and unify national policies, and be unaffected by cabinet changes. The two sides seem likely to engage in heated debate. Because Prime Minister Hirota fears that the plan will not be easily passed, he does not want to implement it hastily, so it was not brought up for discussion at the cabinet meeting on the 13th. Furthermore, suggestions such as merging the various ministries of the cabinet and establishing ministers without portfolio would fundamentally transform the current cabinet. If these are realized, not only will the current cabinet members face the difficulty of deciding whether to stay or go, but also the actual effectiveness of the merger will be highly questionable. Today, it is rumored that Prime Minister Hirota plans to temporarily abolish the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, with its responsibilities to be divided between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and to appoint the current Minister of Colonial Affairs as a minister without portfolio to oversee all affairs currently under the four bureaus of investigation, resources, legislation, and statistics. Whether the above plan will be accepted by all parties is difficult to predict. According to observations by a special correspondent from the Central News Agency, the issue of administrative reform, although the most thorny of all issues, is unlikely to be a fatal blow to the current cabinet. Some compare the Hirota Cabinet to a rubber ball that is not easily broken. These words are indeed appropriate. All aspects of Japan believe that the Hirota Cabinet needs to exist. This view has not yet declined. Even those who drafted the administrative reform plan are unwilling to bear the responsibility of overthrowing the cabinet. Therefore, judging from the current situation, there is still much room for compromise. Some believe that the Japanese cabinet issue is closely related to China policy. However, it should be noted that even if the Hirota Cabinet falls, its successor, while perhaps making slight modifications to its China policy, will certainly make few changes to its general direction. If there are factors that can influence Japan's China policy, these factors are none other than whether China can truly unify and how international circumstances evolve.

<p>Japanese Kamikawa Unit Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>(Changchun) Since autumn, the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army of Northern Manchuria, led by Yang Jingyu, has greatly increased its strength because farmers, unable to bear the excessive taxes and levies of the Japanese puppet regime, have come to join them in droves. They have repeatedly taken advantage of the dense forests to attack the Japanese puppet defense forces and have won many victories. Yesterday afternoon, a guerrilla detachment of more than 100 men from this unit surrounded the Japanese Kamikawa unit stationed in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, and after killing more than a dozen officers and soldiers, including a certain Ono, they advanced along the Hulan-Hai Railway to attack Hulan. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Izuka unit immediately dispatched a team to reinforce them. Because the volunteer army was outnumbered, they temporarily retreated in two directions, east and west. (Hualian News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Philippine Neutrality Issue <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The issue of Philippine neutrality has once again attracted the attention of diplomatic observers today due to the British proposal to maintain the status quo of Pacific defenses. Some observers predict that negotiations to maintain the status quo of defenses on Pacific islands may prompt the United States to seek the opinions of various countries early under the Philippine Independence Act in order to conclude an international treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the Philippines. Secretary of State Hull told reporters from the Associated Press today that negotiations on Pacific defenses between Britain and Japan have not yet touched upon the issue of Philippine neutrality. As for the status of the Philippines, he declined to comment. However, non-official experts said that the Philippines is not only adjacent to China and Japan but also lies between the British colonies in Southeast Asia and various independent countries in Asia, so its status is more important than that of other islands.

<h3 id="e62">Italy Intensifies Naval and Air Force Preparations, Seeks Development in the Mediterranean, Thereby Protecting Significant Interests in Africa, British Naval Shift Eastward Arouses Fear <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The State Council recently issued a notice announcing that Italy should intensify military preparations in the near future. It is now known that the Italian government is particularly focused on the naval and air forces, and its attention is focused on the Mediterranean. Judging from the fact that the 1941 Italian International Exposition will be held in the port of Ostia (the port connecting Rome to the sea), it can be seen that the slogan adopted by the Italian government is indeed "developing from Rome towards the sea." The government now believes that the northeastern border has the Alps as a natural barrier, making it difficult for other countries to invade. The current army strength is sufficient to cope with any offensive. On the contrary, Italy, due to its geographical situation and its significant interests in Africa, urgently needs to have a strong navy to protect its coastlines. However, being equipped with only a navy is feared to be insufficient, and the government has decided to spend 140 million lire to build airfields along the coast to assist the navy. This is the main reason why the provincial government is expanding the naval and air forces. In addition, Italy's expansion of its navy has another reason, which is to target Britain. Historically, the British navy in the Mediterranean has used Malta as its main base, but it does not have a good base in the eastern Mediterranean. Malta is located a short distance from Italian territory. Recently, due to Italy's active preparations for military expansion, the position of the island has become threatened. After recently touring the Mediterranean, British First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare planned to build several bases in the eastern Mediterranean, further away from Italy, to form a complementary situation with Malta. The intention is not difficult to discern. In Italy, the right to freely travel through the eastern Mediterranean traffic routes is believed to be held by Italy in the future. Britain's naval shift eastward is naturally causing fear and trepidation. Therefore, after hearing about the policy Hoare intended to adopt, they were immediately shocked and wanted to reach a friendly compromise with that country. However, they were unwilling to express the word "compromise" orally or in writing. Therefore, they announced the expansion of the insulting army to signal Britain, so that they could pre-emptively secure their position for future negotiations. However, the real intention is not to compete with the British navy in the Mediterranean, because in terms of battleships, Italy currently has only four ships of 25,000 tons, excluding the two under construction (namely the "Vittorio Veneto" and "Littorio," each of 35,000 tons), among which only the "Caesar" and "Count Cavour" have been recently remodeled. In Britain, there are at least eight battleships that can be deployed. In comparison, Italy is inevitably dwarfed. However, Italy is far superior to Britain in terms of light warships.

<h3 id="e63">Germany Will Demand Revision of Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Believes Concessions to Russia Overthrow European Balance of Power, German Military Strategic Position Will Be Reconsidered <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources here, the German government will soon ask the British government to revise the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as a result of the recent conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Naval Agreement. It is said that Hitler is currently discussing the issue with his cabinet members in his hometown of Bavaria. Upon investigation, the articles of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 1935 did not have a final decision on the matter of revision. The agreement stated that only Britain could decide whether the actions of a third country should cause the overall situation to be reconsidered. However, the German government reserved the right to request Britain to consider the new situation if the general balance of naval armaments was drastically overthrown. Several German sources now insist that the Soviet Union's declaration in the Anglo-Russian Naval Agreement regarding its reservation concerning the status of its Far East navy and cruiser armaments has overthrown this balance. Germany believes that its military strategic position in the Baltic Sea will be greatly affected as a result. Currently, in the Anglo-German Agreement, the German naval armament ratio to Britain is 35 to 100, allowing for a fleet of only 400,000 tons, while the French fleet has 650,000 tons. The Germans view Russia's reservation as changing Germany's position at sea in the same way that they once pointed to the Franco-Russian military agreement as being sufficient to change Germany's military strategic position on land. It is worth recalling that when the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was signed, the newly appointed German Ambassador to Britain, General Ribbentrop, who signed on behalf of Germany, called it the first practical step towards arms limitation. Now, only sixteen months later, it has become a serious problem.</p>

<p>(Harbin) Moscow News The Soviet government decided to take the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreement as an opportunity to start a naval expansion plan. The submarine fleet is now concentrated in the two bases of Kronstadt and Vladivostok. According to investigations, there are a total of fifty new submarines stationed in Vladivostok, and the lineup is particularly well-organized. In addition, the supply of naval materials is also more abundant than before as a result of the development of heavy industry in the Second Five-Year Plan, without having to borrow from foreign countries at all. The main points of its future plan are as follows: (1) to build the Pacific and Khabarovsk fleets, and the Black Sea and Caspian Sea combat teams; (2) to construct solid fortresses along the coastline and strengthen air force equipment.

<p>(Berlin) The propaganda movement to restore the old colonies before the European War has now spread throughout the country. The films shown in various cinemas mostly depict the beauty of the scenery of the old colony of Cameroon in Africa and the solid and lasting German construction projects. Although the area has been changed to a British mandated territory since the European War, the businesses that the Germans used to operate still exist today. It is rumored that the German Colonial Association has been dissolved, but the person in charge has solemnly denied it. The association also issued leaflets inviting Germans to join as members. The shop windows in various bookstores are filled with books on colonial issues. The enthusiasm of German colonial sentiment is evident. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After a meeting between German leader Hitler and key members of the National Socialist Party in Berchtesgaden, a major resolution has been made regarding Germany's colonial policy.

However, it is widely believed that even if it is not publicly announced to be dissolved, the association currently has nothing to do in practice. According to the decisions of this meeting, it can be said that it is a victory for the conservatives, who advocate friendship with Britain. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The U.S. State Department yesterday published the secret documents of the Paris Peace Conference regarding the disposition of German colonies. The detailed contents are translated as follows: These documents, mostly belonging to the U.S. foreign relations category of 1921, contain the U.S. government's advocacy that commercial opportunities in the mandated German colonies should be enjoyed equally by the people of all countries, and that the Allied countries should place the German colonies under international management. This full position caused severe disputes at that time in the correspondence between the U.S. and Allied diplomatic authorities. The most intense of these was the dispute between the United States and Japan over the issue of the U.S. mandate for the island of Yap in the Pacific. Yap Island is located between Guam and the Philippine Islands. President Wilson considered this island to be a key point for submarine telegraph cables and should be under international management to become a hub for world transportation. Japan, having obtained the mandate for this island and other islands north of the equator, vehemently opposed Wilson's proposal. Britain, bound by a secret treaty of 1916, spared no effort to support Japan. The United States was very angry at the time and stated in a document sent to Britain that the United States had made a strong contribution to the victory of the Allied countries in the war. In other words, if the United States had not assisted the Allied countries in winning the victory, how could Britain have had the right to dispose of the islands in the North Pacific? In fact, if the United States had not entered the war, the Allied countries would have had no hope of victory, and there would have been nothing to divide up. Now that the Allied countries have won the victory, the opportunity to dispose of the German colonies has arisen. All that the United States is asking for is equal opportunity related to its rights. If Britain is unable to assist the United States due to being bound by secret agreements, it should also notify the United States of the facts, and so on. The entire text proves that the United States has not demanded the expansion of its territory, but only demands that the people of all countries should enjoy equal business opportunities in the former German territories.

London believes that Hitler has explored the entire issue of Franco-German relations.

<p>Madrid - The rebel army's commencement of the assault on the capital has been delayed by another day. Both sides are now engaged in minor skirmishes around the city. This suggests that General Franco, the rebel commander-in-chief, is not yet prepared to order a full-scale attack. The rebels have now occupied the five main areas surrounding the capital from the south to the northeast. However, it is widely believed that the railway from Madrid to Valencia is still operating as usual. According to rebel claims, the Nationalist air force has attacked the major railway junction of Aranjuez near the capital. It seems the rebels intend to cut off rail traffic first before launching an attack on Madrid. General Varela, commander of the rebel forces advancing from the southwest, met today with Colonel Yagüe, commander of the Moorish forces advancing from the south. It is reported that the rebel commanders feel no difficulty in the progress of their future work. According to General Varela, the advance will take time, but the outcome can be predicted. The rebel headquarters in Burgos today denied negotiating terms for the government troops' surrender with the Madrid authorities and stated that the rebels would not accept conditional surrender. Rebel aircraft again dropped leaflets over the capital this afternoon, ordering the authorities and residents to surrender as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, otherwise, the punishment in the future will depend on the degree of resistance.

Currently, street fighting is quite intense in the main streets of Oviedo, which has been besieged by government forces for two months. On the other hand, a radio broadcast from Cadiz claims that the rebel forces that set out from Galicia have reached the gateways to Oviedo and have occupied extremely strong positions. It also claims that a rebel column advancing on Madrid from the northeast has advanced from Guadalajara and Alcalá de Henares, bringing them fifteen miles closer to the capital. It is claimed that the rebels in the south have occupied Peñaroya, Pueblonuevo del Terrible, and Almadén, but on the road from Ávila to Toledo, the government forces claim to have recovered San Martín and Villa del Prado.

<p>Madrid - Regarding the battle situation in the town of Teruel to the east of the capital, the government has recently issued a communiqué stating that the government forces have defeated the rebels and captured more than 200 people. This agency's reporter accompanying the army inspected the government forces' defenses yesterday and learned that the town of Teruel is still in the hands of the rebels. However, their connection with the rebel forces in Aragón province to the northeast is only possible via the city of Zaragoza. Teruel is surrounded by mountains and has steep slopes, and the climate is harsh, making combat extremely difficult. The militia belonging to the government forces have to hide in trenches to protect themselves from the severe cold and are rotated back to the rear for rest. However, they are at a disadvantage due to a lack of weapons. Fortunately, it is not far from the city of Valencia, and meat, food, and fruit can be supplied continuously, making the supply of military rations quite convenient. It is not without reason that people say that the future of the city of Madrid and the Spanish Republic depends on the gain or loss of the eastern seaboard. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Paris) - William Bullitt, the newly appointed US Ambassador to France, presented his credentials to French President Albert Lebrun today. Bullitt was the former US Ambassador to Russia, and the US recognition of Soviet Russia was almost entirely due to Bullitt's personal efforts. Bullitt is very wealthy. In 1919, President Wilson sent him to Soviet Russia to investigate the actual situation of the new Russian government. After returning to the United States, he strongly urged recognition. However, before Bullitt returned to the United States, President Wilson had discussed the Soviet Russian issue with Lloyd George, and his attitude changed, so he did not listen to Bullitt. At that time, Bullitt resigned himself. After Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1932, he brought up the Soviet Russian issue again, and Bullitt made a comeback. The following year, Bullitt attended the London Economic Conference and took the opportunity to discuss the restoration of US-Russian diplomatic relations with Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, which was a success.

<p>Detroit - Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon delivered a campaign speech here today, saying that the New Deal has actually destroyed the democratic system and replaced it with the first step of autocratic politics. The following are the major points: (1) President Roosevelt has completely controlled the financial system under the guise of emergency measures, so that the savings and purchasing power of the people across the country are threatened. (2) The President already has the power to decide the quantity of production and sales in both agriculture and industry. (3) The President has $1.35 billion that can be used at will. (4) Congress has handed over the powers granted by the Constitution. Landon also stated that the government has used its huge propaganda machine to suppress criticism of the government. Landon also questioned the President, asking him to state whether there was a plan to change the American political system. After other countries implemented autocratic politics, all freedoms of speech, publication, thought, and religion were sacrificed. Can the United States not be vigilant? The responsibility of the government is to protect the people from the bullying of private forces, so that they can compete freely, and at the same time, it must protect the people from the bullying of public forces, so that they can preserve their civil rights within the scope of the Constitution.

<h3 id="e78">Japanese Army Urges Aviation Agreement, Japanese Planned Routes Include Five Provinces, Jinlian Aviation Has Already Been Opened Independently <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Large-Scale Autumn Maneuvers by the Japanese Army in North China, Unprecedented Total Mobilization</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, The Sino-Japanese aviation matter and the North China economic cooperation are the problems that the Japanese side values. Since the Japanese garrison in North China, led by Tadashiro, brought up the negotiation with Song Zheyuan in Tianjin on the 1st of this month when Song was in Tianjin, in order to achieve it urgently, they specifically ordered senior staff officer Iida Tsuchiyasu to visit Han in Jin again for further negotiations, and another staff officer, Wachi Takaeji, went to Ping with Songmuro to negotiate with Song again. Wachi himself had also visited Yan Xishan in Taiyuan to negotiate. The Japanese side hopes to open aviation routes in the five provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Chahar, and Suiyuan, following the example of the Eurasian and China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), supervised by the Japanese military and operated by the Japanese-Manchukuo Aviation Company, and run a private organization. In addition to facilitating passengers and carrying mail, they also want to sign an agreement based on the negotiations between the former shareholders and the Japanese Kwantung Army's Yuguan Special Service Agency Chief Takeshita Yoshiharu before May 30th last year, repeating the old story. The Japanese planned routes are: (1) Jinlian, (2) Jinshen, (3) Pingcheng, (4) Chengbing, (5) Qinglian, (6) Shenji. These six routes are the main trunk lines, and there are several connecting lines in addition. The strength of the Hebei-Chahar authorities is only limited to Hebei and Chahar provinces, while the Japanese side's hope includes five provinces. This cannot be achieved by the Hebei-Chahar authorities directly agreeing to it. Therefore, the Japanese military's subordinates are dispatched separately to negotiate this matter, hoping to achieve it. However, since April of this year, the Japanese garrison in North China has independently opened Jinlian Aviation with four military aircraft. Every Monday and Thursday at 11:00 AM, they fly from Dalian to Tianjin and land at the CNAC airfield in Dongjuzi. At around 1:00 PM, they take off from Tianjin and return to Dalian. The aircraft numbers commonly seen are "27", "28", "125", and "125", all four monoplanes. The fare is 25 Japanese yen, which is cheaper than the second-class cabin of a Japanese mail ship between Tianjin and Dalian. However, non-military personnel who do not have a certificate are refused to board. The procedure for purchasing tickets is to obtain a certificate from the Japanese military in Tianjin and then purchase tickets from the Japanese garrison aviation department (also known as  口Public Hall) in the Japanese concession in Tianjin or the Dalian Aviation Branch, and then go to the airfield to board. Recently, the Japanese barracks in Dongjuzi, Tianjin, have been completed, and aircraft come and go from here, so very few outsiders know about it.</p>
<p>The autumn military exercise of the Japanese army in North China was originally scheduled to begin on October 20th. However, because the exercise plan was not completed by the Japanese military's operations section, and also because the communication battalion increased from Japan had not yet arrived to participate, it was postponed by one week and changed to start on October 25th and end on November 4th. The location is near Liangxiang, Changxindian, and Fengtai on the Pinghan Line. The participating troops are all Japanese garrisons stationed in North China, infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and chemical special forces, all dispatched. From the 25th to the 28th, the exercise is held in regimental units. From the 29th to the 30th, the exercise is held in brigade units. From November 1st to the 4th, the exercise is a mixed division exercise, commanded by the first and second infantry regiments, Colonel Taguchi and Colonel Kayashima, and Infantry Brigade Commander Major General Kawabe. Japanese Commander Tadashiro will lead the military's staff to move to Changxindian on November 1st to set up a temporary command post there. All staff are assigned for wartime deployment. The air force under the command of Colonel 口Daiguchi in the aviation department in Tianjin will also lead two air force squadrons to participate. At that time, the air, land, cavalry, infantry, artillery, and chemical teams will maximize their functions to conduct exercises such as offense, defense, encounter, and night combat. The Japanese volunteer corps, retired soldiers, national defense foreign associations, and Boy Scout groups from all over North China will go to join the exercise from all over the country around the 28th. Therefore, the total number of mobilizations for this large-scale exercise is truly unprecedented. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Taiwanese Residents in Xiamen Killed, Japanese Police Illegally Arrested and Interrogated, Only Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau After Interrogation, Many Doubts Arise from the Autopsy of the Deceased <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, The Japanese Consulate in Xiamen has a Japanese police station. However, the consulate is in the Gulangyu Concession, so the Japanese Consulate set up a Japanese police substation in the Xiamen urban area in our territory. This was originally not allowed by the treaty. The police powers exercised by the Japanese police substation are to manage Japanese and Taiwanese residents regarding police administration and judicial matters. However, regarding the execution of arrests, reports, and investigations, before September 18th, they would cooperate with our officialdom, or after our officialdom handled it, they would extradite it to the Japanese consulate. After September 18th, the entire matter was handled by the Japanese police station, and they directly executed it without cooperating with our officialdom. However, they have not yet overstepped their authority to apply it to our people. In August of this year, Ji from Tongan was arrested, claiming that he was Taiwanese, and he was released after being detained for ten days, which was the beginning of exceeding their authority. At 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month, the Japanese police substation suddenly reported that a Taiwanese woman named Zhu Chen, who lived at 193 Siming East Road, said that her husband, Taiwanese Zhu Chaoa, was selling noodles at the entrance of Zeng Guniang Lane. At 10:00 PM on the 7th, two people named Wu Fan Leng A ate noodles and paid, and a dispute arose over the authenticity of the banknotes. Zhu was beaten and injured, and died at 5:00 AM on the 10th. The police station immediately found out that Wu Fan was named Wei Zhaoyu, from Jinjiang, and Leng A was named Jiang Ling, from Hui'an, and were partners in Xingmao Foreign Firm on Jukou Street. The Japanese police were immediately dispatched to the foreign firm to arrest the two and interrogated them strictly. The two admitted that they had an argument with Zhu that night and did not admit to beating him to death. The Japanese police station immediately moved Zhu's body to the Japanese Boai Hospital in Gulangyu for an autopsy. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau was notified by telephone to inform the local court. The court inspector Xu Shaoxue and the Public Security Bureau's Judicial Section Xu Zongyue, led the director of Zhongshan Hospital's medical affairs, Zhang Maolin, to participate in the autopsy. As a result, the Japanese doctor Deng Ming diagnosed that the abdomen was beaten, causing a hole in the large intestine, leakage of excrement, and peritonitis leading to death. According to Dr. Zhang Maolin's judgment, if the deceased's stomach and intestines were ruptured by beating, he should have died immediately and could not have lasted for four days. As for the arrested Wei and Jiang, after being sent to the Xiamen Public Security Bureau by the Japanese Consulate, they will be presented for negotiation. It is found that this case was not reported to the police at the time of the fight, and after death for four days, it was not reported to the police and the court. There was no case before or after. The Japanese police station, according to the report, directly arrested our people and only sent them to our officialdom after interrogation. It is already overstepping its authority, and there are many doubts. Even Zhu Chaoa did not register with our officialdom as a Taiwanese. (October 14th)</p>

<p>County Government Reorganizes Cooperatives</p>
<p>There are a total of 118 cooperatives in this county. Most of them are loosely organized and their affairs are stagnant. Since the former cooperative instructor Qian Zongzhou was removed from his post due to a case, his successor, Shen Guixiang, found it difficult to start reorganizing them for a while. County Magistrate Peng had drafted improvement measures and implemented them step by step in the hope of gradually achieving perfection. Now, in order to thoroughly reorganize them, the county government has specially re-registered all the cooperatives in the county. Once completed, it will actively proceed according to the planned plan.</p>
<p>All Circles Form Joint Office</p>
<p>The county government believes that in this extraordinary period, all agencies and groups should earnestly prepare for contact and preparation. It has specially convened a meeting of all circles and gentry to decide to organize a joint office first and immediately start to prepare for its establishment.</p>

<p>The Wu County Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance on the 14th, stating that according to the statements of the Bamboo Industry Union and the Goods Industry Union, the business tax rate for each industry's bamboo sugar has always been 2 per mille, but it has now been increased to 5 per mille. At this time of commercial decline, the sharp increase in the tax rate is truly unbearable.

<p>Terrible Tragedy of the Collapsed Great World</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. on the 13th, the parrot hall of the Great World Amusement Park outside Guangfu Gate on Dongxin Road in our county suddenly collapsed, injuring nineteen spectators. It is learned that the park was funded and opened by Li Xingru, Li Hanxiang, and others around March of the lunar calendar this year. The park site utilizes the old Qingsheng Theater on Dongxin Road and the remaining land of the Shengwen Cemetery for construction. It was completed and opened on the Dragon Boat Festival. In addition to the Qingsheng Theater performing Peking Opera, there are also the Phoenix, Partridge, Peacock, and Parrot halls, which respectively perform song and dance, drama, Suzhou Tanci (storytelling and ballad singing), a gathering of beautiful women, Wuxi local opera, Yangzhou opera, and a variety of comical acts. At the beginning of the opening, people from the general lower and middle classes of society flocked to it, and business was booming. However, the buildings in each part of the park were built hastily due to the short time, and the construction was inevitably sloppy. Recently, as the weather has turned cooler in autumn, the Parrot Hall has been renovated to perform elegant storytelling sessions with a gathering of famous artists from Suzhou. The Puyu Society Tanci artists Guang Yaozhang, his daughters Lifang and Lijuan, as well as Wang Tingsun, Qian Yunpeng, Zhu Chengtian, and others were hired to perform day and night the stories of "Three Smiles," "The Case of Peng Gong," "The Five Righteous Men," "Green Peony," "The Contract," "Kunshan Ji," and others. At 5 p.m. on the afternoon of the 13th, when the Zhang father and daughters finished singing the opening piece "Daiyu Burning the Manuscript," and were about to continue with the Kunshan Ji, with a crash, the entire building suddenly collapsed. The Zhang father and daughters were unable to escape and were both injured. At the same time, thirty or forty audience members in the hall were also crushed under the rubble and tiles. A total of nineteen people were injured, all with head injuries and bleeding. For a time, the hall was noisy and chaotic. Later, the staff of the park carried the injured to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Among them, Huang Lifang, Wang Zhoushi, Lu Danshi, Ni Qingyu, Zou Jinbao, and Sun Rongxian were the most seriously injured, and it is feared that they will become disabled. After receiving the news, Zhang Da, the head of the Public Security Bureau, immediately dispatched Huang Erheng, the captain of the patrol team, and Fang Henian, an inspector, leading more than ten members of the patrol team to the Great World to investigate, and brought Xie Li, Li Han, to the bureau for investigation. Yesterday, the 14th, the park operated as usual, but the audience was sparse. It is said that the county government, considering the poor construction of the park, will order the Public Security and Construction Bureaus to take measures to ban it in order to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Establishing a Model Silk Factory</p>
<p>The Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, in view of the developed sericulture and numerous silk factories in our county, but not much attention being paid to silk reeling techniques and research, resulting in products that cannot compete with Japanese silk, is planning to establish a Wuxi Model Silk Factory. Tang Xixiang, director of the Hangzhou branch of the Sericulture Improvement Association, has been appointed concurrently as the director of the preparatory office of the Model Silk Factory. After Tang accepted the appointment, he immediately began preparations, advocating emphasis on the experimentation of reeling and the research of new technologies. The initial establishment expenses are tentatively set at 170,000 yuan. The provincial government has now approved the allocation of 100,000 yuan in one lump sum, with the remainder to be paid successively. The location has been selected next to the silk cocoon testing department of the Qianqiao Sericulture Testing Ground, covering an area of more than 20 mu. Construction will begin this winter and is scheduled to be completed next spring. The building style will be entirely Japanese. The factory's mechanical equipment will be planned by the silk reeling expert Zou Jingheng. The silk reeling machines will all use Japanese-style twenty-eye oscillating machines, initially fifty units, and a testing department will be set up separately, equipped with more than twenty types of new and unique silk reeling machines, including Italian machines (old style), Japanese oscillating machines (new style), and multi-end machines (the latest style), with two units of each type, totaling more than fifty units. After its establishment, young, literate women will be recruited to engage in training in silk reeling techniques, with higher compensation than ordinary workers. Food and lodging will be provided by the factory, and special attention will be paid to hygiene facilities, so that all will serve as a model for other silk factories. The preparatory office is located in the Sericulture Testing Ground and is temporarily divided into two departments: technical and sanitary affairs. Technical matters are the responsibility of Zou Jingheng and Zou Haiquan, while several clerks are hired for administrative matters. Currently, the sample hall is expected to issue drawings and begin preparations within days.</p>

<p>The area of Fangcun Jinyuan Furong in Changshan is mountainous, transportation is difficult, and the place is developing rapidly. Suichang was twice occupied by bandits in August. Recently, they have become even more rampant, looting, burning, and killing, happening several times a day. The residences of the Baozhang in Furong Xiyuan Township have all been burned. Wang Jinliang, the Baozhang of Yuanyuan, was killed along with his entire family. The local donations were not rewarded, and the number of men and women killed was also over thirty. Local residents leave their villages every night and spend the night on the mountain peaks, a very miserable situation.</p>

<p>All the Prisoners Went on a Hunger Strike</p>
<p>All the prisoners in the county prison here staged a hunger strike on the morning of the 13th. It is said that the reason was the authorities' reduction of prisoner rations. According to regulations, each prisoner's ration is 25 taels per serving, except for those who contract for their own meals from outside. However, since Gong Yuanbin took over as director of the prison in our county, he has been concerned that the monthly rations are often insufficient due to the large number of detainees. Therefore, as a cost-cutting measure, he deducted five taels from each prisoner's ration, actually issuing twenty taels. As a result, the prisoners suddenly saw their rations reduced and were unable to fill their stomachs. They requested Director Gong to restore the previous situation, but he ignored them. Therefore, the prisoners agreed to go on a hunger strike on the 13th to protest. The prison staff tried hard to persuade them, but the prisoners remained adamant. By 2 p.m., the matter had not been resolved. As a result, it was agreed that the rations would be slightly increased from the 14th and weighed on a market scale before each meal, which resolved the situation.</p>
<p>Prolonged Drought Damaged Late Rice</p>
<p>For a month, it has not rained, and the weather has been unusually dry. Many people in society have suffered from throat diseases and malaria. Moreover, the late rice planted in the Meitang area has not yet fully matured and grown, and needs to be soaked in rainwater. Because it has not rained for a long time, coupled with the scorching sun, most of the late rice has withered and died, and the soil is as hard as iron. Even if water is pumped, it will be of no use. Therefore, the farmers are quite worried.</p>

As a result, the fire spread to Shun Chang Hardware Store, Yingbin Hotel, Chuntai Hotel, Fuyun Steamship Bureau, and about a dozen nearby tofu and noodle shops, as well as shacks. The three-story building of the Beautiful Western Restaurant across the street was also affected. Fortunately, public security fire trucks and fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene after hearing the news and tried their best to put out the fire. It was not until about 2 a.m. that the fire was extinguished. Wang Guisheng, the manager of the Huayang Building, where the fire started, was taken to the fourth sub-bureau of the first branch for interrogation and punishment. It is reported that the fire destroyed thirty-two houses, causing a loss of about forty to fifty thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Bandits Robbed Remittance Letter</p>
<p>Jiang Hanbo, the accountant of the Jiangdu County Government, was traveling by car near the Fifth Lane of the Old City around 12 p.m. on the 13th when he caught sight of two men in long gowns and leather shoes running towards him. They brushed past his car and disappeared. Soon after, another person, also panting and sweating, came tracking after them. Surprised, Jiang asked what was happening. The man said his name was Wang Yuanzhang and he was a clerk at the Jiangsu Bank in the city. Zhou Houjun, the director of the Jiangsu Bank in Guanyun, had remitted ten yuan to the home of Zhou Xianglin at No. 24 Dongguan Street. Wang had been ordered to deliver the money to Zhou's house and a letter to the county education bureau. When he arrived at Zhou's house, only a doorkeeper was there, so he took the money back, asking her to tell her master to come to the bank to collect the money. Afterward, he went to the county government to deliver the official letter, intending to go to the education bureau afterward. However, when he walked to the entrance of the Fifth Lane of the Old City, three men in long gowns and leather shoes suddenly appeared, ordering him to stop, swarming forward, searching him, and robbing the ten yuan remittance before running away. Only then did he realize that they were bandits. Jiang was shocked to hear that a robbery had occurred near the county government in broad daylight. He immediately reported to County Magistrate Ma, who ordered the police chief Shi of the third branch of the Public Security Bureau and Liu Zonghan of the detective team to solve the case within a time limit.</p>

<p>The exercise grounds for our garrison used to be located in Miaojiadi, near the suburbs of Beiping. At that time, it was called "Target Practice." Later, the scale expanded, and the name changed to "Exercise." And the location extended from the suburbs to Fengtai. Later, the scale became even larger, extending westward from Fengtai to Lugouqiao and Changxindian on the Pinghan Line. Thus, in addition to exercises, there were also so-called "Marches" and so-called "Camping." Recently, the date for the large-scale "Autumn Maneuvers" has been formally notified to us, and the area will be further expanded southward, including Liangxiang County as well. I once read an essay by the Japanese essayist Yūsuke Tsurumi. In it, upon hearing the rumbling of cannons from Changxindian in Beijing, he expressed his infinite sadness at the revolving-lantern-like civil wars of the Feng-Zhili warlords in China at that time. More than ten years later, although the sound of cannons can be heard again, its meaning is completely different from the past. I wonder what Mr. Tsurumi would think if he heard it now.</p>

After leaving Xibianmen, vegetable plots and nurseries were all green, stretching for about ten miles. On the green fields, there were one or two red or white horses, dotting the landscape, all turning water wheels to irrigate the plots. Farmers in the villages were bending over in the fields, busy working. When the train passed, they all shielded their eyes with their hands and looked up. The quiet and peaceful atmosphere made one feel as if they were in a painting. Imagining it, the sound of cannons and gunfire from dozens of miles away, to them, must sound like firecrackers, and they must constantly be suspicious, perhaps wondering why there were so many weddings far away. The more I think about it, the more I sigh. Not much sorghum was seen along the way, but peanuts, soybeans, and the like were everywhere. There were also many coal shops and steam furnace shops near the railway. For dozens of miles, the train passed several coal trains with ten or more cars. The abundance of coal produced along the Pinghan Line is evident. All of the above are very different from the various scenes along the Beining Road to Fengtai. And what makes one feel more at ease than between Ping and Fengtai is two things. First, the advertising signs for a certain foreign product have slightly decreased, and second, the tracks of certain foreign vagrants are also rarely seen. At least in the current situation, the control of a certain country over this road is indeed slightly less than its control over the Beining Road.</p>
<p>As the train approached Changxindian, just as the reporter was looking north out the window, he suddenly heard a fellow passenger shouting repeatedly, "Look! Look! Look! Look!" Turning around quickly and looking south out the window, he saw foreign troops lined up in seven or eight rows at the foot of the distant mountains and on the winding road, heading northwest. The place was exactly the road between Lugouqiao and Changxindian, and at that time, they were heading from Lugouqiao to Changxindian. A farmer-like passenger suddenly asked the reporter, "Why are they all ×× soldiers! Where are our own?" The reporter had no words to answer and could only force a wry smile. But he did not give up his question, and pressed the reporter even harder. "Sir! Sir! Hmm? Hmm?" At this time, the reporter felt extremely embarrassed. Fortunately, he suddenly pointed out the window and shouted loudly to himself, "Look, look! On that hilltop, look: isn't that our team!" The reporter followed his finger and looked, and as a result, he recognized that the team standing on the hilltop was still in khaki uniforms, not the gray ones of our own army. I suppose the reporter's eyesight was slightly better than this honest farmer. But in order not to disappoint him too much, I couldn't bear to break the news.</p>
<p>At 2:50 p.m., the train arrived at Changxindian Station. The first thing that caught my eye was the station sign. Unlike the Beining Road, the station name did not include any foreign writing in addition to the Chinese and English station names. Next to the Chinese characters was the National Phonetic Alphabet. From afar, I suspected it was foreign writing. Looking closely, I realized it was the phonetic alphabet, and the feeling of gratification was, as people usually say, "indescribable."</p>
<p>Exiting the station and entering the streets of Changxindian. This is a town belonging to Wanping County. The street is an east-west street, and the households face each other from north to south across the street. The street is about four or five miles long, with about a thousand households. In a small alley on the east side of the street, near the station, there is a post office. Apart from everything else that is common elsewhere, there is a long strip of paper specially posted at its entrance, reading "Agency for Exchanging Central China Communications Bank Legal Tender." Seeing this also gave me an inexplicable feeling of gratification. At the east end of the street, there is a primary school, and the town chief's office is also attached to it. The eastern section of the street is a dirt road, the middle section is cobblestones, and the western section is also a dirt road, all about a few dozen feet wide. On both sides of the street center, there are shallow ditches, with no standing water. Between the ditch and the front of the households, there is a raised space of about two feet. Occasionally, there are food stalls, but most of them are filled with men, women, old and young, chatting and passing the time, their attitude very leisurely. Pedestrians on the street are sparse, and a dozen camels carrying sacks are actually lying in the center of the street to rest, blocking the road, but the townspeople seem to be used to it and do not find it strange at all. Rickshaw pullers also have no customers to pull, leaning idly on the rickshaw handles, or dozing off, or reading tabloids, or smoking cigarettes, everywhere. The slanting rays of the early autumn sun highlight a scene of leisure and relaxation.</p>
<p>Statistically, among the shops along the street, general stores are the most numerous, followed by tea and pastry shops. Other types of shops, such as barber shops, restaurants, and clothing stores, which are common everywhere in large cities, are rarely seen here. This is due to the different needs. The wind of economic depression has also spread to this small town. Signs for big discounts and big giveaways flutter in the wind outside the dilapidated storefronts. But in reality, not only are there no customers, but there are not many people walking on the street.</p>
<p>Advertising for foreign goods such as Lao Du eye drops and Daxue eye drops is also rare between the walls, but much less than in Fengtai and other places. Especially advertisements for domestic goods, such as Great Wall cigarettes, Beauty cigarettes, and even Two Girls brand old-fashioned cologne, also appear on the walls from time to time, which is completely absent in places like Fengtai. The most striking thing along the street is the advertising signs for Daxue eye drops and Lao Du eye drops erected outside the doors of the grocery stores. The signs are four or five feet high, with a half-length portrait of a foreign old man painted at the top. Roughly calculated, there are about a dozen such advertising signs in the entire Changxindian street, which can also be said to be quite a few.</p>
<p>In the middle of the street, there is a private middle school converted from a temple. The facade is dilapidated, with the school sign "Private Wenyi Middle School" and the horizontal inscription "Fairy Temple" side by side. Outside the door, three or four beggar-like people are sitting and scratching themselves in the sun. Entering is a corridor, at the end of which is a magnificent hall, already in disrepair. A ten-foot-high iron tripod is placed in front of the hall. As the reporter wandered under it, the students in the classrooms on both sides stretched their heads out of the windows in clusters and looked at the reporter from afar, whispering in each other's ears, not knowing what they were saying. It is not easy to concentrate on classes in this environment.</p>
<p>On the hill opposite the station, there is a school for the children of railway employees. The building is neat and the layout is elegant. Looking down from the hill, the scenery within a radius of more than ten miles is all within sight. At that time, they were having a music lesson, and the singing was loud and majestic, spreading from the hill, filling the valley and the sidewalks. What they were singing was the Song of the Broad Road. At 5:18 p.m., the No. 42 train moved north towards Beiping. Although there was constant gunfire coming from the northeast, the majestic singing on the hillside was also quite loud, which inspired infinite enthusiasm in the midst of sadness. (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Status of Private Schools in Various Provinces and Cities Across the Country <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently compiled the following overview of private schools in various provinces and cities across the country in the 24th year:</p>
<p>(Notes) (1) It is claimed that since the 22nd year, all private schools in Xinjiang Province have been taken over by the cultural promotion associations of various ethnic groups and converted into association-established elementary schools, and there are few remaining. Weihaiwei reported that there are currently no private schools in its territory. Hunan and Xikang provinces have not submitted reports and are therefore omitted. (2) Most of the counties and cities under the jurisdiction of each province have not been able to submit complete reports. For example, in Jiangxi, Hubei, Yunnan, Shandong, Sichuan, Guizhou and other provinces, more than half or nearly one-third have failed to submit reports. According to the simplified administrative region table published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, these 22 provinces (including Xinjiang) have more than 1,680 counties and cities. Currently, reports have been submitted by approximately 1,300 counties and cities (of which approximately 330 counties and cities have reported no private schools), accounting for approximately 82% of all counties and cities. (3) Among the 100,000+ private schools, approximately 35,304 have been improved (using school textbooks), and 65,630 have not been improved (not using school textbooks). Among the provinces and cities with improved schools, Shanghai accounts for the most at 92.77%, and Chahar accounts for the most at 8.66%. Qinghai has no improved schools. Jiangsu has the most at 20,000+ schools, and Qinghai has the fewest at only eight schools. (4) There are 31,037 improved tutors and 65,776 unimproved tutors. Among the 100,000+ tutors, 8,533 have received normal school education, 21,621 have received primary and secondary school education, and 70,659 are from private schools. Among the provinces and cities with teachers who have received normal school education, Shanxi has the most, accounting for 28.02%, and Zhejiang has the least, accounting for 3.06%. (5) Among the 1.7 million+ students, 708,556 are improved and 1,048,458 are not improved. Among the provinces and cities with improved students, Shanghai accounts for the most at 93.90%, while Guangxi accounts for 81.34%. Chahar has the fewest at 13.05%. On average, each private school has 18.09 students. Qinghai and Nanjing have the most at 25.38 students per school, while Shandong has the fewest at 11.2 students. (6) The annual tuition collected is 6,557,733 yuan. On average, each private school collects approximately 64 yuan, 80 cents in tuition. Beijing collects the most on average at 173 yuan. Most cities collect over 100 yuan. Among the provinces, only Guangdong collects 111 yuan per year, and most are between 40 and 70 yuan. The average annual tuition fee is 3 yuan, 58 cents. Qingdao has the highest average at 13 yuan, 60 cents per student, and most are only between 3 and 6 yuan. Qinghai has only 1 yuan, 80 cents, and Gansu has the lowest at 1 yuan, 70 cents. (7) The number of private schools is approximately one-third of the number of elementary schools, the number of private school teachers is approximately one-sixth of the number of elementary school teachers and staff, but the number of students taught is very large. At this time of promoting compulsory education, the reorganization and improvement of private schools so that management, training and teaching can be gradually improved, and the selection of excellent ones to be converted into short and small primary schools, is of great help to the future of compulsory education.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Dr. Xue Guangqian's Speech: The Revival of Italy and China (Part 1) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Because the Party Serves the People, the People Love the Party Unswervingly; Reviving China Requires No Theory, but Speaking the Truth and Doing Real Things</p>
<p>The city's Banking Association held a lecture yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road, inviting Dr. Xue Guangqian to speak on "The Revival of Italy and China." More than 300 people attended. The main points of his speech are recorded below. Ladies and gentlemen, today's lecture topic is "The Revival of Italy and China." The reason for discussing the way to revive China with Italy as a backdrop is not because Italy is the strongest, wealthiest, and most advanced country today. It is because, 14 years ago, Italy was still a country full of scars and riddled with holes. Since Mussolini came to power, he has been striving for good governance, and the country's power has been growing day by day. The way he reformed and built the country has many aspects that can be learned from by our countrymen. Moreover, its people inherited the legacy of the Roman Empire and became old and backward, just like China today. Its national political system is also similar to one-party rule. Therefore, its national character and conditions are different from those of European and American countries. To discuss the success of Italy's one-party rule, we must explore its</p>
<p>Party and Government Organization</p>
<p>The structure of the organization: The Italian people are rich in loyalty to the monarch. Therefore, although the Fascist Party holds power, it still sets up a nominal monarch and does not abolish it. The government organization is based on party laws and various other laws. The Fascist Party believes that to maintain the authority of party governance, it must absolutely not relax its grip on political power. It uses the power of the party to infiltrate the government organization, so that there is no boundary between party and government, and they are integrated. For example, newspaper censorship does not involve setting up another agency in the central party headquarters, but rather adding a propaganda department to the cabinet, alongside the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and having it presided over by party members. This makes the public see that the censors are not the party headquarters but the government. All government words and deeds are based solely on the law. Laws are all implemented through decrees, so the public believes that the censors are actually acting on imperial will. There is no time to obey imperial will, so how can there be any reason to rebel? Youth training is also the most important task of the party, but it does not involve setting up a special agency in the central party headquarters to take charge of it. Instead, a Deputy Minister of Physical Education is added to the Ministry of Education to implement training according to the party constitution. However, the public sees that the youth trainers are not the party headquarters but the government and the monarch. As for the</p>
<p>Party's Work</p>
<p>It is entirely a social relief undertaking. Public officials throughout Italy are given priority to party members when hired (currently, recruitment of party members has been suspended; there are now two methods for joining: one is to receive party training from birth until the age of 21 before being allowed to join, and the other is for university students under the age of 26 to join the university's Fascist group and be accepted only after two years). Therefore, no party members are unemployed. As a result, the party headquarters are closed during the day, and the party congress is held once a year and is very simple, reporting on the financial situation of the past year. The usual activities are all after 8:00 PM. The party headquarters are similar to a club, with a cafe, dance hall, reading room, and music room, becoming a place for leisure after work. All work is centered on providing relief to the poor in the district, and decisions are made during these after-dinner conversations. Therefore, saying that there are no meetings is actually equivalent to a major gathering. As for the source of funds, it mostly comes from party members. Therefore, the Fascist Party of Italy not only has party members supporting the party, but also takes care of the poor. Because the party can serve the people, the people love the party and do not waver in their loyalty to the party. Another important task of the party is the unified control of work and leisure time. Because Italy was plagued by communist disturbances before Mussolini came to power, great attention was paid to the lives of workers. After the workers' eight-hour workday, the party headquarters formulated various methods to organize and control their leisure time, so that they could not and would not want to get close to the communists. If various sports competitions are held, they can not only cultivate their minds and bodies but also lead them onto the right track and enjoy legitimate entertainment. However, throughout the country, there are no slogans or banners of support or opposition. When I visited Italy, it was when the Italo-Ethiopian War broke out, so I witnessed firsthand how it coped with economic sanctions and ultimately achieved victory. Italy's invasion of Ethiopia had been planned for a long time, so its launch was not triggered by a sudden impulse, and its victory was not achieved overnight.</p>

<p>Private Shanghai City North Middle School has been established for more than 20 years and has always been divided into high school and junior high school. The high school is further divided into liberal arts and business courses. Due to the destruction of the school building during the January 28 Incident, the business courses were temporarily suspended. Now that the school building has been rebuilt and is even more expanded than before, and in order to promote vocational education to meet the needs, the vocational courses will be restored starting next semester. The Senior Accounting Department will be established first, and it has been submitted to the Shanghai Education Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Education for instructions. After receiving the Ministry's order, the school first established a vocational course preparatory committee, recommending Dr. Xu Peikun, former President of the National Business College, as the director of the preparatory committee. At the same time, Xu Yongzuo, Pan Xulun, Jin Guobao, Wang Zhicui, Zhou Yangwen, Xu Peikun, Lin Jinyu, Pan Zhongjia, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao, and Zhuang Zhujiu and other experts were invited as consultants. It was established the other day, and Xu Yongzuo was elected as the chairman of the consultant committee to discuss all implementation methods.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Tilden Arrives in Shanghai; Performance Program Under Discussion; Tilden Wrote Yesterday Saying He Will Perform Five Sets of Singles with Vines; Canavaro Asks to Partner with Mecca Again for a Doubles Performance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The world professional tennis players Tilden, Vines, and Miss Sharbo and their party, after deciding to pass through Shanghai on the 6th of next month to attend the performance, everything has become a reality. What everyone wants to know most now is the program of the performance. According to Mr. Canavaro, who is in charge of this competition, Mr. Tilden sent him a letter yesterday (the 13th), saying that he has decided to perform a singles match with Vines, with a total of five sets. Mr. Canavaro's opinion is that in addition to the Tilden-Vines singles performance, Tilden should also partner with a Shanghai Mecca, and Vines should partner with Canavaro himself or Mecca, for a doubles performance. Before the start, four Mecca players from this city will perform a doubles match as a prelude, for a total of three matches. Due to the time limit, each match will be three sets. This opinion has been sent to Mr. Tilden by express mail yesterday morning to seek his consent. As for the candidates for Mecca, it has not yet been decided, or Mecca will be selected by mutual recommendation. The performance time is expected to start between 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM. Tickets are divided into two types, 3 yuan and 5 yuan, and have been sent to the printer. They will be available for sale in the middle of next week. As for whether Mr. Tilden will be willing to attend another performance when he passes through Shanghai for the second time on his return trip, it is difficult to predict now. If the weather is too cold at that time, Mr. Tilden will not be willing to attend. If the weather is still as mild as last time, it will not be a problem, and I hope so very much. Currently, the bamboo canopy at Mr. Card's court at 153 Avenue Notre Dame has been removed, and a piece of vacant land from the Pu Yi Real Estate Company in front has been rented, and a Portuguese architect has been commissioned to design and build a grandstand with a capacity of 3,400 to 3,800 seats. The project is contracted by Gu Yongtai Bamboo Shop at the intersection of Xiaosha Ferry Road and Avenue Ivan, and construction started yesterday and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. Mr. Card also rented the grandstand seat boards from Shen Yuan the other day, and the deal is about to be concluded. The proposed performance program will be officially decided after Mr. Tilden agrees. Mr. Card himself has been unusually tired recently, and he may not be able to attend at that time. The tentative order is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Doubles: Shanghai Mecca (candidates undecided)</p>
<p>(2) Singles: Tilden vs. Vines</p>
<p>(3) Doubles: Tilden and Shanghai Mecca vs. Vines and Canavaro or Mecca</p>

<p>— Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>(11) Women's Education</p>
<p>The purpose of Japanese women's education is to cultivate beautiful female virtues, with the aim of creating suitable good wives and wise mothers. The implementation is also progressing towards this monthly goal. Some courses in Japanese higher girls' schools, such as sewing, cooking, etiquette, tea ceremony, home decoration, and education, are prepared for female students to become good wives and wise mothers when they leave school in the future. The school currently has 13 graduating classes, with a total of 592 graduates. Among them, 181 are married, accounting for about one-third of all graduates.</p>
<p>The environment of the girls' school is very quiet and beautiful. The school building is surrounded by trees, and the open space is covered with green lawns. The special classrooms inside the school building are also very well equipped. The etiquette room for female students is divided into two types: one is decorated with several Japanese-style rooms, representing a typical Japanese family; the other is decorated with several foreign-style rooms, with a Western flavor. There are also two sewing rooms: one is a Japanese-style sewing room, where students learn to sew Japanese-style clothes; the other is a Western-style sewing room, where students learn to sew Western-style clothes. The cooking room is large, with multiple stoves, which can be used by students to practice Chinese, Japanese, and Western cooking. There is also a dyeing room, which can be used by students to practice dyeing clothes.</p>
<p>(12) Besides higher girls' schools, there are also Japanese vocational youth schools and Japanese commercial schools in Shanghai. The vocational youth school is a night school, with classes three hours every night. It is attached to the North Common Higher Elementary School and has classes in the school building. The school is of a remedial nature and only has three years of junior high school level. In terms of courses, in addition to Japanese language, ethics, and English, there is also a part of commercial courses, such as arithmetic, abacus, commercial knowledge, commercial geography, and bookkeeping. There are also four hours of Chinese per week, focusing on Shanghai dialect conversation and writing.</p>
<p>The commercial school is a formal commercial secondary school with a five-year curriculum and 34 hours of classes per week. The courses include ethics, Japanese language, mathematics, history, geography, natural science, physical education, drawing, commercial knowledge, and commercial practice. There is also a Chinese language course, taught for four hours per week per academic year, focusing on Mandarin conversation and writing. In the teaching of each subject, the focus is on cultivating commercial talents. For example: the national language, Chinese grammar, and composition focus on commercial application writing, and calligraphy focuses on commercial application fonts; numbers focus on commercial arithmetic and abacus; history and geography focus on world commercial history and commercial geography; drawing focuses on commercial advertising paintings. The commercial knowledge course focuses on bookkeeping, commercial law, statistics, and finance. Commercial practice is held in the fifth grade, focusing on import and export commercial practice and typing practice. Through this excellent training and practice, the commercial personnel cultivated by the school can meet the needs of society.</p>

<p>The New News Agency reports that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, accompanied Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission from Nanjing to Shanghai by plane on the afternoon of Double Ten Day. After staying in Shanghai for one night, he took the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train to Hangzhou the next morning to attend the graduation ceremony of the Aviation Military Academy. He returned to Shanghai by car at about 10 PM the night before. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, he went to the Central Bank to review important official documents and met with Song Ziliang, Director of the Finance Department of Guangdong Province, Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, and others to inquire about everything. Subsequently, he met with reporters from various newspapers. Regarding the rumor that China and the United Kingdom were about to establish a credit loan, Kong did not deny it. However, the amount of the loan, the process of negotiation, and the content of the loan contract were not disclosed due to the early stage of negotiations. The main points of Kong's conversation stated that such loans are frequently negotiated between various countries and us, not just one country. Credit loans between countries are extremely common, and the amount is not large, so there is nothing to be surprised about. He hoped that the people of the country would not make neurotic speculations about such ordinary matters. Kong also spoke about the new gold standard agreement established by Britain, the United States, and France, saying that this kind of international monetary agreement is produced by stabilizing international exchange rates, which is a good phenomenon for international finance.</p>

<p>Original Text of the Circular:</p>
<p>"The New Life Movement is a crucial plan for national salvation. Since its establishment, this association has been actively promoting it in accordance with the essential points indicated by the president. However, this movement involves changing customs and reforming the old and establishing the new. If we only rely on the advocacy of a few people without enlightening others, the promotion will inevitably be hindered, and the results will be difficult to universalize. In view of this, this association has decided to organize the Shanghai New Life Movement Training Session for two months, starting from November 1st. Staff members will be designated by various institutions, schools, and organizations in this city and recommended to attend. This association will invite academic celebrities from the central and local levels who have a thorough understanding of the New Life Movement to serve as lecturers and impart various practical knowledge, so that the trainees will have a deeper understanding and a stronger belief in the New Life Movement in the future. They will become the center for promoting the New Life Movement in their original institutions, providing consultations for the supervisors, and promoting it locally, so that the results can be easily achieved. We have found that the quota for trainees in the training session is × people. We request your × to designate staff members from your institution and affiliated institutions (district party headquarters) (teams). We are enclosing the regulations and sending this letter for your reference. Please send the list of designated staff members to this association before the 22nd of this month for verification and to facilitate the process. Sincerely yours."

<p>The New News Agency reports that after the news of the impending establishment of a credit loan agreement between China and the United Kingdom was transmitted by the Free International Telegraph, the financial sector here paid close attention. According to the opinions of important figures in the banking sector, if this move is realized, not only will China's finance in the international market turn for the better, but also international trade will prosper as a result. Therefore, both China and the United Kingdom will jointly benefit from it. The negotiation of this priced loan agreement has a long history, dating back to when the British financial advisor Sir Frederick Leith-Ross came to China. After several discussions between the two parties, it is now about to mature. Although the total amount of the loan has not been determined, it is approximately 5 million pounds. Calculated at the current exchange rate, it is about 60 million yuan in national currency. However, the date of establishment of the loan agreement and the distribution of the amount of cash and goods in the total loan amount still need to be negotiated and decided by both parties.</p>

The formal contract will be signed after approval by the head offices. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Substitute Exchange of Subsidiary Currency Notes</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Local Bank and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank are provincial banks in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces and have been approved to issue 1-, 2-, and 5-cent subsidiary currency notes. Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the two provincial banks have agreed on mutual exchange measures, stipulating that the branches of the two banks along and near the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, such as Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, Quzhou in Zhejiang, and Nanchang, Yushan, Hekou, Shangrao, and Guixi in Jiangxi, can mutually exchange them. Therefore, in the future, anyone holding subsidiary currency notes issued by the two provincial banks can apply for exchange at any time to the local branches of the two banks.</p>
<p>Mutual Exchange of Remittances</p>
<p>At the same time, in view of the increasing prosperity of commerce in the two provinces after the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the two provincial banks have agreed to mutually exchange remittances at the places where the two banks have established branches, in order to facilitate the transactions of merchants and people. It is also stipulated that the collection and transfer of funds between banks will be free of charge, and the fees charged to the outside world will be reduced as much as possible. The branches of the two banks are gradually spreading to various counties in the two provinces. Therefore, in the future, when the people of the two provinces need to exchange remittances for commercial purposes, they can apply for exchange at any time to the local branches of the two banks.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Two Ships Run Aground Outside Haizhou Port <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>One Outside Haizhou Port, One at Chenjiagang Port</p>
<p>Hengshan</p>
<p>The Hengshan, owned by the Sanbei Company, weighs 1,922 tons and has a draft of 17 feet 6 inches. Recently, the ship was transporting salt in Haizhou. On Tuesday of this week (the 13th), at about 6 AM, the ship was loading a large amount of salt in Haizhou and heading for the Yangtze River. As soon as it left Haizhou Port, it encountered an extremely strong southwest wind, and the Hengshan ran aground in Haizhou Port. The captain measured the water and found that it was only 14 feet deep, but the Hengshan's draft was 17 feet 6 inches, causing the ship to sink deep into the beach and unable to move. The captain urgently reversed the engine to try to get out of the shallow water on its own, but all attempts failed. Until yesterday morning, after more than 20 hours, it was still difficult to escape. The captain telegraphed Shanghai for help. Upon receiving the news, the company urgently telegraphed the Fengpu ship, which is currently in Haizhou, ordering it to rush to rescue the Hengshan. At the same time, it telegraphed the captain of the Hengshan, ordering him to wait for the arrival of the Fengpu to tow it. The Fengpu has now arrived at the scene and is currently towing the ship.</p>
<p>Yunlong</p>
<p>The Yunlong, owned by the Shanghai Heng'an Chengji Shipping Company, weighs 1,770 tons and has a draft of 19 feet. The ship was recently sailing to the Yangtze River and Haizhou, specializing in transporting salt to various places upstream. Yesterday morning, Heng'an Company received an urgent telegram from the captain of the Yunlong, which stated that the ship had loaded all the salt in Haizhou and was sailing out of the port when it reached Chenjiagang Port. Due to the shallow water, the Yunlong was heavily loaded and had a deep draft, causing it to run aground. Even at high tide, it was unable to escape. After receiving the report, the Shanghai company telegraphed Haizhou to inquire about the current situation of the ship and devise a rescue plan. At the same time, the company also sent a letter to the China Ship Insurance Association for verification. The details of the grounding have been telegraphed to the captain for reporting. On one hand, it is considering sending a ship to tow it.</p>

<h3 id="e125">After the Annual Meeting of the Tea Industry Association Was Suspended, a Small Group Meeting Was Held Yesterday to Discuss Solutions. The Discussion Will Continue Today Due to the Absence of Wu Juenong. The Tea Industry Association Published Detailed Account of the Dispute. <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the opening of the first annual meeting of the China Tea Industry Association, the general meeting was suspended the day before yesterday due to a dispute. After persuasion from party and government agencies, a small group meeting was held yesterday morning to discuss solutions. The discussion continued at 2 PM, but was postponed to today due to the temporary absence of Director Wu Juenong. The Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association released a detailed account of the events, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Small Group Meeting</p>
<p>After a dispute arose over the issue of new members joining the Tea Industry Association, a small group meeting was held at 10 AM yesterday at the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association in Gujia Lane after the persuasion of representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department. Directors Wu Juenong and Zai Zhenhuan, Chairman of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association Ye Shichang, and tea merchant representatives from various places, including Chen Chucai, Yao Yiquan, and Zhang Jingyang, attended the meeting on time. First, the tea merchant representatives from various places expressed their opinions, requesting that new members and old members should be treated equally. The presidium of the general meeting accepted this in principle and scheduled a continuation of the meeting at the original location at 2 PM. However, due to the absence of Director and Presidium Member Wu Juenong, there were no results, and it was decided to hold another meeting today.</p>
<p>Published Account</p>
<p>Ye Shichang, Chairman of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association, released the following account yesterday: "(1) The reasons for the postponement of the annual meeting of the Tea Industry Association as reported in the evening newspapers of the 13th and the newspapers of the 14th, which stated that there was a conflict of opinions between political and business circles, are inconsistent with the facts. The tea merchants among the members have always made no expression to the government other than proposing suggestions to the government. When most of the members went to the social venue at the time, they saw two kinds of paper strips posted on the wall, one for attending members and one for non-voting members. They thought that the members attending the meeting had all received the meeting notice from the association, reported for registration, and had exercised their voting rights when selecting examiners on the 11th, so they naturally obtained membership qualifications. Suddenly, there was unequal treatment, and questions arose. The presidium was unable to explain for a while, so the party department instructor announced the postponement of the meeting. (2) On the afternoon of the 13th, Section Chief Wu Huanru of the Social Affairs Bureau expressed his opinions to the presidium and the member representatives, encouraging the members to unite in spirit, without the need to distinguish between new and old members, and advised them to hold a small group meeting. Once the opinions of all parties are consistent, then the general meeting will be continued to avoid disputes. (3) On the morning of the 14th, the presidium of the association convened tea merchant representatives at the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, for a small group meeting. The opinions of the members who were designated as non-voting members were very simple, only requiring equal treatment across the board, without distinguishing between new and old members. There would be no problem. However, Mr. Wu Juenong believed that today's meeting should only increase the number of directors and not involve the issue of membership qualifications, but the majority believed that laws, articles of association, facts, and reason should all be considered and taken care of, and unity in spirit should be maintained. As a result, part of the presidium believed that members should no longer be distinguished between new and old and should be treated equally, while another part believed that there were still problems. The afternoon meeting had to be continued due to the absence of Wu Juenong. My opinion is that the Tea Industry Association is an organization in which people across the country jointly seek to improve and develop the tea industry. Members must all work together harmoniously. This kind of small misunderstanding will soon be eliminated. This association is working hard to mediate in order to achieve unity in spirit."</p>
<p>Reporting to the Government</p>
<p>The Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association sent Ye Shichang, Yu Xiji, and Zhu Yanqing to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in the city center at 4 PM yesterday to report to Director Pan and Section Chief Wu on the details of the small group meeting, the absence of Wu Juenong, and the lack of results from the meeting. They returned at about 5 PM and reported on the trip to the Social Affairs Bureau to tea merchant representatives from various places and members of the association.</p>

<p>Purchasing or Transporting Requires a Purchase and Transport Certificate, Social Affairs Bureau Notifies Various Rice Industry Organizations</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau issued instructions to trade associations of Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, Rice Industry, Rice Shops, and Rice Dealers, as well as the Rice Carriers Joint Association, stating that when purchasing goods from Henan, a purchase and transport certificate must be obtained. The Miscellaneous Grains Association should notify all members. The official document issued by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau with the reference number 1739 stated that the Henan Provincial Government plans to formulate temporary measures for grain export and has forwarded the instructions to inform all businesses to comply with them. Copies of the Henan Provincial Temporary Measures for Grain Export and the purchase and transport certificate form are sent to the association for implementation and reference. The so-called grain mentioned above includes rice, wheat, soybeans, sesame, and other items. In the future, if businesses purchase the above-mentioned goods from Henan Province for shipment to Shanghai or other places, they should first report the name, tonnage, departure vehicle, and destination of the purchased goods to the Fourth Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to issue a grain purchase and transport certificate. If there are shipments in batches, they must also apply for the certificate in order, so as to purchase and transport. A copy of the Henan Provincial Temporary Measures for Grain Export and a copy of the grain purchase and transport certificate form are included.</p>
<p>Grain Export Measures</p>
<p>The text of the Henan Province Temporary Measures for Grain Export is as follows: Article 1: Flour mills or companies in and outside the province that purchase grain in this province must hold a purchase and transport certificate issued by the provincial and municipal governments where the factory or company is located.

Article 3: Those who purchase and transport grain in the province without leaving the province must hold a purchase and transport certificate issued by the county government where the merchant's store is located. Article 4: For those who purchase grain in large quantities in this province without a purchase and transport certificate, the county governments should prohibit them at any time, and the transportation agencies should refuse to transport them. Article 5: If the quantity of purchase and transport stated on the aforementioned purchase and transport certificate cannot be purchased or transported all at once, it can be purchased and transported in several times. Each time, the county government and transportation agency where it is located should indicate the quantity on the certificate, but the total quantity shall not exceed the original quantity. Article 6: When county governments issue purchase and transport certificates to grain merchants, they should verify that the grain merchants are purchasing and transporting grain to help the people's food supply before issuing them. However, no handling fee may be charged.</p>
<p>Grain Purchase and Transport Certificate</p>
<p>The original text of the grain purchase and transport certificate issued by the Social Affairs Bureau states: "The Provincial/Municipal/County Government of [Blank] issues the grain purchase and transport certificate. It is reported by [Blank] Company/Factory/Firm/Merchant that they intend to purchase [Blank] tons of [Blank] from [Blank] County, [Blank] Province, and transport them by [Blank] road/station/dock to [Blank] County, [Blank] Province.

In accordance with Article [Blank] of the Henan Province Temporary Measures for Grain Export, a grain purchase and transport certificate is hereby issued as proof to [Blank] Company/Factory/Firm/Merchant for their use. Republic of China, [Blank] Month, [Blank] Day." This is a two-part form, with the lower part being the stub, with the same text, including "(In addition to issuing the purchase and transport certificate, this is kept for reference)."</p>

<p>The China General Federation of Industrial Associations was proceeding with plans to establish branches in Guangdong and Guangxi, but the process was interrupted due to the circumstances of the time.

<h3 id="e131">General Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Salt Affairs Administration: Please Release Wu Huinan <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wu Huinan, a supervisor of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, opened a Fengtai general store in Langxi County, Anhui Province. The area usually consumes Zhejiang salt. Last winter, due to a shortage of Zhejiang salt, he transported refined salt from Biqiao Town in the neighboring Yixian County for sale in the market. It was inspected, sealed, and ordered to be returned by Ling Xiaochao, the district chief of the sixth district of the Fifth Taxation District of Jiangsu. He requested permission to open the seal and return the salt to Biqiao. A small amount was kept for personal consumption. Then, Shao, the captain of the 58th team under the district, arrived in Langxi and ordered him to pay the price of the official salt. Wu Huinan complied and paid it. After appealing to the Chief Inspectorate, he was ordered to be handed over to the court for trial. While Wu Huinan was waiting for the summons for questioning, he was suddenly arrested at the Great China Hotel in the French Concession of the city on the 2nd of this month. The telegram from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance is recorded as follows: Honorable Sir of the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: It has been found that this association previously received a letter from Wu Huinan, a member of the Langxi Chamber of Commerce, regarding the case of transporting and selling refined salt across districts. This association telegraphed in the winter of this month to request that the illegal punishment by the tax police be stopped. Recently, a letter from Wu Huinan's family stated that Wu Huinan was falsely accused of being a smuggler by Shao, the captain of the 98th team of the sixth district of the Fifth Taxation District of Jiangsu, and was arrested on the 2nd of this month and detained at the Shanghai Local Court for more than ten days. Wu Huinan is over sixty years old, old and sick. This torture has caused a threat to his life. They requested that it be forwarded to the court for redress. Based on this, it was found that the refined salt had already paid national taxes and was not smuggled salt. The problem only arose due to the wrong district. Moreover, the salt was ordered to be returned, and the salt price had already been paid. The matter was also reported to the Salt Affairs Chief Inspectorate, and an instruction was issued to transfer it to the local court for trial. He should have waited for the court to summon him for questioning according to the law. Now, the court has not yet issued a summons, but the captain has falsely accused him of being a smuggler and has arbitrarily arrested and detained him. The people have lost the protection of the law. Correspondingly, we are telegraphing again to your administration for review, immediately requesting that you issue a telegram order to release Wu Huinan and allow him to wait for the local court to summon him for questioning in order to clarify the truth and uphold the law. This is our earnest hope. National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<p>The Chinese Insurance Society, since the first annual meeting, amended Article 7 of its articles of association to "Directors shall be elected by members through postal ballot, and the first board of directors shall be authorized to count the votes." It is learned that the association held a vote count on the 12th at the conference room on the third floor of the Bank of China.

<h3 id="e140">Carriage Pullers Mutual Aid Association Board of Directors Resolves to Reorganize; New Licenses for Carriage Pullers to Be Issued Starting January Next Year; More Than 2,700 New Cars Currently in the City <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the board of directors of the Carriage Pullers Mutual Aid Association, the Municipal Council's Special Committee on Carriage Pullers recently convened a meeting on Monday this week (the 12th) to discuss it. According to the opinions of the Chinese members, there is no need for representatives of car dealers and carriage pullers on the board of directors, and the Mutual Aid Association fees do not need to be collected from carriage pullers by car dealers in the future. They can be supplemented by increasing the license fee. In this way, these funds will belong to the income of the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Council can consider dividing these funds as the Municipal Council's donation to the Mutual Aid Association. As for the organization of the Custodial Committee, it may remain the same, that is, one person will be appointed by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors, and one person each will be recommended by the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the three will jointly organize it. However, the board of directors will inevitably have to be reorganized, and the existing 12 members can be reduced to nine, with three members each recommended by the Municipal Council, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese Ratepayers Association, and car dealers and carriage pullers may not be appointed as directors. The above suggestions have been approved by the Special Committee on Carriage Pullers and submitted to the Board of Directors. At the same time, it was solemnly stated that the donations that the Municipal Council intends to give to the Mutual Aid Association may be stopped by the Municipal Council at any time depending on the circumstances, and the representatives of the Municipal Council on the board of directors may not be Municipal Council staff. The above suggestions were unanimously approved at the regular meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday (the 14th).</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the issuance of new licenses to public carriage pullers, it has now been decided to start on January 4 next year and end on February 25. Within this prescribed period, each person will pay 20 cents per license, which will be deducted from the Municipal Council's donation to the Mutual Aid Association. After the deadline, the fee will be 50 cents. From March 1, carriage pullers who do not wear the appropriate armband will not be allowed to engage in carriage pulling. According to the survey, as of October 12, there were 2,727 new-style carriages in the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Jiangsu Provincial Government: Strictly Arrest Pirates and Robbers of Magnetic Vessels <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Robbed Twice in Recent Months; Please Order Strict Arrests to Ensure the Safety of Transport Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting the strict arrest of bandits and robbers to ensure the safety of merchants. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Jianzhen Jiangsu Provincial Government: It was reported on the 13th of this month that the Magnetic Industry Association stated in a letter that, according to reports from its members, the Chen Hongfa sailboat hired from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi to transport porcelain to Shanghai was traveling to Xingang, Rucao County, sixty miles above Tongzhou, when, due to wind resistance, it anchored in the harbor as usual. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 PM on September 12, it was suddenly robbed by more than a dozen bandits with weapons, and 16 pieces of porcelain were lost. The boatman reported it to the local public security bureau, which sent personnel to investigate on file, etc. It has been found that the members of the association purchase goods in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, and transport them to Shanghai for sale, which is purely a transport business. The cost of traveling on the Yangtze River is no less than several million yuan this year, and on May 29 this year, the Wang Caihua sailboat transporting porcelain was also robbed of 79 pieces of porcelain by bandits in Xiaoligang, Nantong County, more than ten miles above Tongzhou. The local water public security bureau and the Nantong County District Office were requested by the association to strictly investigate the case, but after several months, it was impossible to capture them. It seems that the bandits are rampant and arbitrarily robbing, which not only disturbs merchants and civilians, but also affects local security, which is particularly important. This is a special letter to your association, asking you to forward it to the relevant competent authorities and order them to strictly arrest the case and punish them according to the law, so as to pacify the bandits and facilitate the public, etc. The association has found that there have been frequent cases of robbery of merchant ships in Tongru County in recent years. Although they have been reported and arrested, few cases have been solved, which makes the navigation of merchant goods dangerous. Judging from the cases reported by various industries, first, the pig boats of the fresh pig industry were robbed many times, and now the porcelain boats have been robbed twice in recent months. The robbery case of May 29 has been more than four months, and there is still no news of the arrest. It seems that the bandits are rampant, the water police are slack, and how can merchants and travelers rest easy? It is reasonable to report the situation to your government for review, please strictly order your subordinates to investigate and arrest the cases separately, in order to solve the entire case and recover the stolen goods, so that transport merchants will not suffer losses, and it is hoped that it will be achieved. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shangbao Hotel: Cracking Down on Tattoo Gang <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Li Xingcai and Wang Tianba; Five People Claim to Be Tattoo Artists</p>
<p>The Shangbao Hotel at the intersection of Datong Road and Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, to the west of the Daxing Vegetable Market, at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, just after the amusement park on the upper floor of the vegetable market dispersed, six tourists wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers opened room No. 5 in the hotel. At that time, Xie Xiong, the patrolling police chief of the Xinzha Public Security Bureau, and police officers Chi Baoren and others passed by and found that none of the tourists were registered in the tourist circulation book and that their behavior was suspicious, so they immediately entered the room for questioning. According to them, one of the six people, Li Xingcai (nicknamed Little Ningbo), was good at drawing flowers on people's arms (that is, the so-called tattoo gang), and they all went to ask him to tattoo them, and there was nothing else going on. A search of the room did not find any contraband. Police Chief Xie was concerned that in such a troubled place, these people might be holding secret meetings to plot wrongdoing, so they were all taken to the bureau. After questioning by the bureau staff, Li Xingcai claimed to be 20 years old, from Ningbo, living on Chang'an Road, Hanzhong Road, but did not know the house number, and admitted to tattooing people without concealment. He then took out a pencil and drew a Huang Tianshuang on the spot as proof. The other five people were named Ge Rucheng, 21 years old, from Funing, living in a thatched shed at the end of Datong Road; Yu Gaosheng, 28 years old, from Yancheng, also living in a thatched shed on Datong Road; Sun Rujiang, 28 years old, from Funing, living at No. 1 Hutai Road; Li Chuntao, 25 years old, from Yancheng, living in a thatched shed on Hutai Road; and Tang Guicai, 24 years old, from Yancheng, living in a thatched shed at the end of Zhijiang Temple Road, making a living by pulling rickshaws. The five people confessed that they had nothing to do after the theater ended, so they went to the hotel to play and asked Little Ningbo to tattoo them. After the interrogating officer verified the confessions, because Li Xingcai and the other six people were hiding in the hotel, fearing that they were not good people, in addition to instructing the original police chief to investigate and reply in detail and wait for verification and handling, Little Ningbo and the other six people were sent to the detective team for investigation.</p>

<p>Band Still Lacks Two Specialists</p>
<p>The winter performance arrangements for the Municipal Council's orchestra and brass band were recently drafted by the Municipal Council's Music Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The general outline is as follows: Recently, the weather has become cooler, but it is not yet winter, so the brass band will continue to perform alternately in the Fawangdu Park and the Bund Park every Saturday from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM, until the weather becomes cold. The winter Sunday concerts will still be held in the Lyceum Theatre as usual, starting at 5:15 PM and ending at about 7:00 PM. The ticket prices will still be divided into elegant music and popular music. The Board of Directors has also authorized the chief conductor to temporarily hire soloists to participate in the performance under appropriate conditions, and when famous musicians come to Shanghai, the working group of the Music Committee may make special arrangements to invite them. Matters such as publicity and free tickets for music performances will be handled by the working group. According to the chief conductor's report, the Municipal Council band is still short of two specialist musicians, one who plays the French horn and one who is the chief timpanist. These two people cannot be hired in this city, so they must be found abroad.</p>

<p>Chen Dadi, a member of the Shanghai South Inspection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau, resides at No. 297 Jiangyin Street, Nanshi. Previously, he received threatening letters, ten bullets, a long ingot, tin foil ash, and other items from the post office. Someone also forged mourning notices and sent them to various people on his behalf, deliberately insulting him and endangering his safety. He reported it to the Finance Bureau, which forwarded it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to order a subordinate investigation. However, the letter was anonymous and has not been found. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Tao A'nan suddenly carried a small coffin to Chen's residence. Chen was out at the time, so Wang Shinong (30 years old, from Taixing, also a Finance Bureau staff member), who lived with Chen, took Tao to the police station. Tao confessed that he was a plasterer, 45 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 156 Jiangyin Street. He was sent the coffin by someone he did not know and was unaware of the details. He was charged with public insult and attempted extortion and sent to the general bureau for strict investigation of the instigator to be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<h3 id="e147">The Murderer of Zhang Longhai, Yang Chunyi, is Apprehended; Arrested in Bengbu and Escorted to Shanghai; Admitted to the Murder During Interrogation <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>—Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Attaches Great Importance to This Case—</p>
<p>Zhang Longhai, a mailman from the Shanghai Central Post Office, was at his residence at 131 Jiangwan Hetan West Road around 8 PM on July 15th of this year when Yang Chunyi, who was supposedly a policeman in the city, broke in through the front door and shot Zhang several times in the chest with a handgun. The bullets hit vital organs, and he died immediately. At the same time, Zhang Longhai's concubine, Shen Cuie, was also shot and killed. Shen Cuie's younger sister, Shen Sifang, was also shot once, but fortunately, it was not fatal. The murderer, Yang Chun, fled the scene immediately. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union repeatedly sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, strictly ordering the arrest of the murderer, but no arrests were made. On the 7th of last month, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union received a report from Shen Sifang, the younger sister of Zhang Longhai's concubine Shen Cuie, stating that Yang Chunyi, the murderer of Zhang Longhai, had recently sent a letter from Bengbu (attached below), where he is now employed, requesting that he be arrested quickly to uphold the law. The union immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, requesting them to order detectives to go and arrest him at the address provided. The bureau then dispatched personnel to cooperate with the Bengbu Public Security Bureau to arrest him. The murderer was then apprehended and has now been escorted to Shanghai and transferred to the local court for interrogation. He was interrogated once the day before yesterday (the 12th) and directly admitted to the murder. A second interrogation is scheduled for tomorrow (the 16th), and a sentence will be announced at a set date. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union attaches great importance to this case. The details of the incident and the confession of the offender Yang are described below:</p>
<p>Yang's Letter to Shen Sifang</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Uncle and Aunt Si Lin,</p>
<p>I hope you are well. I left Shanjiangwan on the fifteenth of last month and have not been able to report back since. I stayed in Nanjing for many days and was ill with a venereal disease. I could not find work and have now returned to Bengbu. I have been living on Er Ma Road for over a month and have fully recovered. I have now joined the Bureau of Finance with a salary of twenty yuan per month. I am short of clothes and bedding. After I have purchased them, I will send the remaining money home for Xiaogou, Yuying, and Yuemei to use. Do not be too sad about the Jiangwan incident. People cannot be brought back to life. It was their fate. I hope Sifang (Xiaomei) studies hard and works hard at school. Do not listen to outside gossip. What happened before was my fault. Please do not always remember it. Please give my regards to Lu Gaofa and Gao Jinhu's mother, the rice shop owner's wife, and Boss Qinchang. I will write again next time. Sincerely. Also, please ask Gu Meisheng to pay back the twenty yuan he borrowed, and Wei Shouye (from the police station in the 2nd precinct, Yongxing Road, 5th district) to return the fourteen yuan he owes. If you get it back, you can use it to buy tinfoil for (Longhai and Cuie). Sincerely. I wish you both good health.</p>
<p>From your nephew, Yang Chunyi.</p>
<p>Yang Chunyi's Written Confession</p>
<p>Yang Chunyi, 32 years old, from Nan Suizhou, Anhui Province, formerly served as a policeman in the North Railway Station Branch in Shanghai for about nine years. After completing his duties, he met a woman named Shen Cuie. The woman had a relationship with a postman after a long period of time. The policeman used up all the money he had. He then heard that she had a relationship with a man named Xiaobao at 131 Jiangwan Hetan Road. They quarreled many times. Her younger sister tried to persuade them, but then she had a relationship with the postman Zhang Longhai. The policeman was heartbroken and attempted suicide unsuccessfully. Later, his mother often went to the hospital, bringing Cuie to visit him. They reconciled. After the policeman was discharged from the hospital, he was transferred from the North Railway Station Branch to the First Squadron of the Public Security Bureau. His mother and Cuie often went to the bureau, saying how good he was. The policeman continued to visit them, often going to Jiangwan and his mother-in-law's house. His mother-in-law often made trouble at home because of money. The policeman handed over the accounts to his mother-in-law to manage. Because of training, he could not visit often. Shen Sifang, also known as Xiaomei, also had a relationship with Zhang Longhai. The policeman then attempted suicide by cutting himself. He attempted suicide at Lu Senji Timber Shop at 165 Zhonghua Xin Road. At the same time, Lu Gaofa reported to Police Chief Liu Huanlin. He called the Public Security Bureau and the Fire Brigade ambulance. He was sent to Shanghai Public Hospital for treatment. Around 2:40 PM on September 22nd of the 20th year, he reconciled with his family. He then went to the Public Security Bureau to collect his belongings. He returned to the team at four or five o'clock. Because all the policeman's clothes were stored at his mother-in-law's house, she took care of everything. Because Xiaomei did not come back for dinner, the policeman asked his mother-in-law why she did not come. She said she went to Jiangwan to make a living for a few days. The policeman was resentful. He took his own handgun to Jiangwan at 6:10 PM on July 15th of this year. He went to her house at 131 Hetan Road and fired three shots at the three people. He then fled. He did not know if they were dead or alive. The policeman then took a small path south of the railway and fled to a small inn on Baoxing Road, North Sichuan Road. He then wrote a letter to the First Squadron of the Public Security Bureau. At night, the policeman took the gun east on North Sichuan Road and handed it over to the patrol in front of the road, placing it on the ground. The policeman urinated and looked towards her house. The policeman went to the Tilanqiao Wharf. After arriving in Nanjing, he failed to find a job. He then went to the recruitment office of the 56th Division in Bengbu and became a messenger.</p>
<p>Yang Chunyi's personal confession, the 15th day</p>
<p>The Court Scheduled Another Hearing for Tomorrow</p>
<p>The suspect Yang was escorted from Bengbu to Shanghai and immediately transferred to the Nanshi Local Court for interrogation. During the first interrogation the day before yesterday (the 12th), the suspect directly admitted to the murder, providing the same confession as before. The court has now scheduled another interrogation for tomorrow (the 16th) and will announce a sentence at a fixed date. The local Postal Workers' Union attaches great importance to this case.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Blood Soul Assassination Squad Throws Bomb; Victim Testifies in Court; Defendants Admit Separately; Case Concluded, Sentence Announced on the 21st <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Liu Hantao, Chuan Chaobai, Yin Jiafu, Wang Dongcai, Guan Yaoting, and five other members of the Blood Soul Assassination Squad were arrested by the Public Concession police in August for throwing bombs at various shops in the Public Concession to warn against the sale of inferior goods. They were prosecuted by the First Special District Court and sentenced to imprisonment. The French police then found that Liu and others had also committed similar crimes in the French Concession. The First Special Court transferred Liu and others to the case and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. It was later found that the defendants had thrown bombs at four locations: Xie Da Xiang Foreign Goods Store on Xiaodongmen Main Street, Yuanhe Sugar Store on Xinkaihe Road in the Republic, Rixin Sheng Foreign Goods Store on Fada Road, and the home of wealthy merchant Bei Runsheng on Beile Road. The French Concession police filed a public prosecution with the Second Special Court in accordance with Articles 151, 154, and 181 of the Criminal Code for disrupting order and endangering public safety. The defendants hired lawyers Wu Peng and Fan Gang for defense. Judge Chen Ying repeatedly held hearings to investigate the case. Because the witnesses were not all present, the hearing was adjourned to another date for further examination. All the details were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The witness Bei Runsheng testified that his home was bombed twice, on November 29th, 1933, and January 8th, 1934, at around 6 or 7 PM. The first time the glass windows were destroyed, and the second time the bomb did not explode in the garden. Both times, the police were notified. Before the incident, he received an anonymous letter saying that there was something to be sent to him. The representative of Yuanhe Sugar Store, Mr. He, said that a bomb was thrown on the drying platform sometime in February of the 20th year, but he could not remember the exact date. The bomb damaged the Stirling lock, and the shell was taken away after reporting to the police. The representative of Xie Da Xiang said that on November 18th, 1935, at 4 PM, there was a sudden explosion under the shop window, damaging the glass and the foreign cloth. The defendants admitted to the above-mentioned facts. The court believed that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the opening of the debate. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen argued that the police charged defendants 1, 3, 4, 5 with articles 151, 154, and 181 of the Criminal Code, and the second defendant with articles 151 and 154 of the Criminal Code. Four plaintiffs testified in court and the defendants admitted to throwing bombs separately. The content of their crimes was a warning, but not an act of fraud. The defense lawyer then made a defense for the defendants. The court announced the conclusion of the case and set the date for sentencing on the morning of the 20th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The exhibition of the late painter Mr. Zhang Xian's posthumous works opened yesterday on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store. More than 100 pieces of his posthumous works were displayed, mostly traditional Chinese paintings and line drawings of figures, dynamic and evocative, with an elusive sense of strength, uniquely pioneering a new era in the national art scene. The audience was quite enthusiastic. At 5 PM, the opening ceremony was held. Over 200 people attended, including Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, Du Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liu Haisu, President of the Shanghai Art College, and famous painters Wang Jiyuan and Pan Liangyu. Chairman Liu Haisu gave a speech, followed by a speech by Cai Yuanpei, who stated that Mr. Zhang's art was superb, but it was a pity that he did not live long. His impoverished widow and orphans were especially pitiful. He hoped that art-loving comrades would enthusiastically purchase and collect his posthumous works, both to commemorate him forever and to extend kindness to those who are both living and dead, which he believed would be appreciated by everyone. The ceremony then concluded, and everyone went to view the exhibition. The exhibition is open from 9 AM to 8 PM daily and is scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Discontinue the Wheelbarrow Committee <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee, also known as the Wheelbarrow Committee, was established in May 1934. For more than two years, it has spared no effort in improving the rickshaw affairs in the Public Concession and has achieved remarkable results. It is reported that at the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday (October 14), the recommendations of the Special Rickshaw Committee were adopted, and it was decided that the Wheelbarrow Committee would be discontinued at the end of this year. All rickshaw affairs will be transferred to the Police Department thereafter. According to the report submitted by the Special Committee, since the establishment of the Wheelbarrow Committee, its tasks have now been completed, such as the registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers, which have now been completed, and the number of new-style vehicles on the market has now reached 3,000. The rickshaw rent has also been reduced twice. In the future, the Police Department can handle rickshaw affairs as a normal part of its duties. In addition, at the beginning of the establishment of the Wheelbarrow Committee, the term of office was originally set for half a year. When the half-year term expired, it was felt necessary to extend it. Now that the work has been completed, the transfer to the police authorities for continued operation will save a huge amount of money for the Municipal Council's finances each year. There are still two and a half months before the end of the year, which is more than enough to handle the transfer. The continued operation by the police after that will not be inferior to the previous operation.</p>

<p>Sun Lindi, a Ningbo woman (18 years old), lives at No. 8 Helin Lane, Yulin Road. She used to be a female worker in the tin packing section of the Huacheng Cigarette Factory on Huishan Road. Recently, she was lured by her girlfriends to change her career and learn to dance at the Xu Xiang Dance Hall on Fuzhou Road. Her father, Sun Xiaohua, was very unhappy about this and beat her. Lindi was enamored of the life of a dancer and often sneaked out. Her father could not stop her. At 9 AM on the morning of the 12th of this month, he bought an iron chain and two small locks from a hardware store and locked his daughter's feet to the bed, preventing her from stepping out. Until noon the day before yesterday, Detective Xie Wanfang and Detective Liu Zhisheng of the Chinese Detective Team discovered this, rushed to the address, and saw the woman groaning on the bed calling for help. Sun Xiaohua happened to be out shopping and had taken the key with him. He did not return until after 2 PM. After he was asked to open the lock, he was arrested along with the lock and chain and taken to the Yulin Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and filed a public prosecution for the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 301, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and stated that although the defendant was the woman's parent, he could not use this illegal means. He requested an investigation. Detective Xie then reported the course of events and presented the evidence. The woman, Lin Di, explained the past. The defendant was questioned and stated that he did not want his daughter to be a dancer and wanted her to work in the cigarette factory. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Sun Xiaohua to a fine of 30 yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be sentenced to labor service, with 2 yuan equaling one day. The sentence was suspended for two years. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>Ge Guanfu, a typesetter for this newspaper from Suzhou, lived at No. 11 Sanduo Lane, Daji Road, Nanshi. Recently, his newly remarried wife, Ms. Liu, filed a case against him in court for assault, scheduled to be heard yesterday. At 2 PM the day before yesterday, Ge Guanfu was killed in the downstairs bedroom of his home, while Ms. Liu fled without a trace. The Public Security Bureau investigated all aspects of the case, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, his mother and the local security guard Yang Jing jointly filed a report with the court requesting an inspection and accusing his wife, Ms. Liu, of suspicion of adultery and murder, requesting investigation and arrest. Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia and Inspector Xuan Zhiming were commissioned to conduct the inspection. They found that the deceased Ge Guanfu, 35 years old, from Suzhou, was wearing a white cloth short shirt and pants, white socks, and cloth shoes. His head was near the side of the bed, and his body was lying horizontally on the ground. His neck had been pierced, forming a hole about one inch deep and wide and about three inches long, shaped like it had been stabbed with a sharp knife. The trachea had been severed, confirming that he died from the injury before his death. They also inspected the miscellaneous items in the room, which were in a messy state, leaving a kitchen knife. They then questioned the corpse's mother. The corpse's mother was Ge's stepmother, who stated that her daughter-in-law was unusually fierce. Her husband's death and her escape clearly indicated conspiracy and requested investigation and arrest for prosecution. The prosecutor then ordered a sworn statement to be made to prepare the corpse for burial and await the arrest of the murderer. It was also learned that Ge was a member of the Municipal Newspaper Industry Workers' Union. The council members of the union were shocked by the tragic death of the member and requested the party and government authorities to quickly arrest the murderer to redress the injustice for the deceased.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Hankou Road One-Way Traffic to be Abolished <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Date to be Announced After Board of Directors Decides</p>
<p>Since the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road, merchants in the area have repeatedly suggested to the Municipal Council that it be abolished, as it affects their business. This matter has been brewing for a long time. On the 6th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Security Committee re-discussed the matter, expressing sympathy for the obstruction of commerce. According to the opinion of the Police Chief, it seems that the abolition of one-way traffic will not cause major obstacles to vehicle traffic. After the abolition of one-way traffic on Hankou Road, vehicles will be diverted to Edward Road and Fuzhou Road, and the congestion on Nanjing Road will not increase excessively. Therefore, the Security Committee resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve the abolition of the current one-way traffic on Hankou Road. The date of abolition will be announced after the Board of Directors makes a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Japanese Porcelain Imported to Shanghai in Nine Months Reaches 900,000 <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Sells Well in Various Places, But the Quality is Very Poor</p>
<p>Shenshi Agency reports that Chinese porcelain is famous worldwide, with annual exports reaching 1 million yuan, sold to England, America, the Philippines, Siam, India, and other places. In recent years, India, Siam, Southeast Asia, and other places have been affected by the competition of Japanese porcelain, and the export of Chinese porcelain has been greatly impacted. As the special forces of Japan extend into China, Japanese porcelain goods flow into China continuously. Since the "September 18th" Incident in the three northeastern provinces, porcelain from Jiangxi and other places has been unable to be exported beyond the customs. The porcelain market in North China this year is flooded with smuggled goods. As for the import of Japanese porcelain to Shanghai this year, it has reached about 900,000 yuan in nine months. The exports and imports of Chinese porcelain do not offset each other, and there is a trade deficit. It is reported that the current Japanese porcelain imports are mainly vegetable bowls, bowls, teacups, and other items, which sell well in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuhan, and other places. Their appearance is full of Japanese artistic colors, but the quality is very poor. They are not as durable as Chinese porcelain and break easily. However, Chinese people do not know the quality and blindly buy Japanese goods, resulting in significant losses.</p>

<p>Kerosene Ship Split in Two, Wang Abing Negotiating</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:50, the foreign ship Roanoke entered the port. At about 8 AM, it sailed to the Huangpu River near the Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui. At that time, a kiln goods ship with the number 27818, fully loaded with tiles and kiln goods, was coming from south to north. Behind it was a barge with the number 34065, carrying 1,170 cans of kerosene, continuing to follow. When the foreign ship sailed to the front of Longmao Wharf, the bow of the ship violently collided with the middle cabin of the kerosene barge, splitting it in two. The ship immediately sank, and all 1,170 cans of kerosene also sank into the Huangpu River. The boatmen who fell into the water were rescued by nearby sampans. About 300 cans of oil that were floating on the river were salvaged. After the accident, the ship continued to move forward. Barge boss Wang Abing and Ye Jiali have reported to the Jianghai Customs Water Police Station. The broken ship has been towed to the Jiangbian River in Pudong for beaching.

<p>The Royal Asiatic Society at 20 Museum Road is scheduled to hold the opening lecture of the season today at 5:30 PM. The speaker is the President of the Society, Mr. Su Wenpei, who will speak on "Animals in Chinese Art." Mr. Su has a well-cultivated background in art and is also a naturalist. He is known for his research on Chinese flora and fauna. Mr. Su specializes in art and natural history. He is particularly interested in identifying the types of birds, mammals, reptiles, aquatic animals, and insects depicted by Chinese artists and craftsmen, and in researching the reasons for their choice of materials or specimens, and the reasons why a large number of animals are not imitated by artists. For example, why does the monkey in Chinese paintings always hold a peach? Why is only the spotted sika deer depicted in paintings? And why is the owl not seen in Chinese art? All of these are fascinating. Mr. Su's lecture will trace back to the pictographs and bones of the Shang Dynasty 3,000 years ago, down to the most recent modern times, and will use specimens, rubbings, and lantern slides from his personal collection to aid in the explanation.</p>

At 0:40 yesterday morning, the amusement department had closed. Yang hired a rickshaw, intending to return home. Halfway there, Yang suddenly remembered that the key to his house was forgotten at the company. He ordered the rickshaw puller to return to the company, but because the door on Guizhou Road was locked and there was no one watching, he had to enter from Guangxi Road. He climbed to the sixth floor via the escalator, and went to the Guizhou Road entrance to take the elevator down. Unexpectedly, the lights were off, and the elevator was stopped at the bottom floor. Due to his recklessness, he tried to open the iron door. As soon as he stepped in with one foot, he fell down and was instantly injured and killed. Lu Zhounan, who installs the lights for the company, was lying in the motor room, heard a loud noise, and got up and searched everywhere for the cause, but found nothing. Later, he heard from Min Shengkou, a cook in the middle kitchen, that he had seen Yang return to the company, but had not left. He went to the sixth floor with him, turned on the lights, and saw that Yang had fallen on the elevator floor on the lower floor. He immediately called an ambulance and tried to lift him up, but he was already lifeless. The local Old Zha Police Station ordered detectives to investigate.

Recently, Luo Tianyou brought 1,400 hat bodies worth 940 yuan to Shanghai and stayed at the home of his friend Hong Zongchao at No. 8 Longqing Lane, Ningbo Road.

<p>Zheng Liansheng from Suzhou, living at No. 1, Sanxinfang, Lane 86, Guba Road, French Concession, runs the Peimei Flower Shop next to Huilu Company on Nanjing Road. His eldest daughter is married to the nephew of the chairman of Jiangxi Province, Xiong Shihui. His son, Zheng Yangyuan, works at the Central Bank and is married to the third daughter of the late Shanghai celebrity Pu Jinrong. Liansheng's second daughter, Jinghan, is 23 years old and has received a modern education, and is a modern woman. Last autumn, through the introduction of Bao Shengbo, she became engaged in Dagali restaurant on Beijing Road to Bao Wenhai, the son of Bao Maoji, a Chinese compradore of the former Luheng Foreign Firm (28 years old, currently secretary of Jiang Guoli Business College, living at No. 40, Renji Lane, Lane 433, Xinzha Road). Since the engagement, the engaged couple exchanged letters and were very close, with their feelings reaching the extreme. At that time, Bao sent the woman's family 400 yuan in national currency as a betrothal gift. However, before long, a rift developed between Zheng Jinghan and Bao Wenhai, leading to a breakup. The woman then proposed to cancel the engagement. After several negotiations, the woman's family was willing to return the 400 yuan betrothal gift and compensate the man's family for losses of 300 yuan in foreign currency as conditions for cancellation. With Bao Wenhai's consent, it was agreed to sign the cancellation agreement at 2:00 PM on the 28th of last month at the office of lawyer Wang Weizhen, room 519, 5th floor of the Mainland Commercial Building on Nanjing Road. Attendees included Zheng Liansheng, Zheng Yangyuan, Zheng Jingman, and Liansheng's wife Zhao, Bao Maoji, Bao Wenhai, and the matchmaker Bao Shengbo. However, because Bao Wenhai forgot to bring two photos of Zheng Jinghan, and the Zheng family insisted that Bao produce the photos immediately, a quarrel broke out. Initially, it was a verbal argument, followed by physical violence, resulting in injuries to both parties. Lawyer Wang persuaded them to disperse. Bao and his son immediately reported to the central police station, while Zheng and his son reported to the police station the next morning. The police ordered them to file lawsuits themselves. Now, Zheng Liansheng, represented by lawyer Yin Shijie, filed a lawsuit against Bao and his son in the First Special District Court for injury, and attached a civil suit, demanding compensation for medical expenses of 167 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special District Court summoned them to the Fifth Criminal Court. Lawyer Wang was also summoned to testify in court. Because both parties had hopes of reconciliation, the trial was adjourned for further questioning after hearing. Bao and his son also hired lawyer Shi Zhuoren to sue Zheng Liansheng, Zheng Yangyuan, Zheng Jinghan, and Zheng Zhao for joint injury in the Second Special District Court, and attached a civil suit, demanding compensation for medical expenses of 300 yuan. It is said that the trial will also begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e175">After Wang Xiaozhi's Death, His Daughter Sues for Division of Inheritance; Case Has Been Concluded and Will Be Pronounced on the 19th <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The late Wang Rongji, owner of a construction company, Wang Xiaozhi, resided at No. 18, Rongsheng Lane, Xiangcheng Lane, Bair Road, French Concession, which was his self-purchased property. He cohabited with a local woman, Wu Kunyu (50 years old this year), until 1920, when they disagreed. On October 13 of that year, they agreed to separate and made a contract, which was certified by lawyer Wang Zhengshao. It was also stated that the daughter A Xing, i.e., Wang Suying (25 years old this year, residing at No. 112, Mandelan Road), would be the responsibility of the woman, Wu Kunyu. The ownership of the daughter would also be borne by Wu. Wang Xiaozhi passed away on August 1 of this year, leaving an inheritance of nearly 400,000 yuan, all of which is controlled by Wang Ziben (22 years old this year, studying at Shanghai University), Wang's biological son. Wang Suying demanded a one-quarter share of the inheritance but was denied. She hired lawyer Dong Yu to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Wang Ziben, demanding that he be ordered to allocate one-quarter of the inheritance. According to the lawsuit, the court yesterday summoned them to the Seventh Civil Court, with Judge Wu Xiaoke presiding. The plaintiff arrived with her lawyer, stating the facts and reasons for the lawsuit. The defendant was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping, who argued that the plaintiff's biological mother, Wu Kunyu, cohabited with the defendant's father in 1918. The plaintiff was not born to the defendant's father. In April 1936, the defendant's father gave the plaintiff 3,000 yuan in foreign currency as a dowry. The plaintiff personally wrote a separation document, which can be established. He presented the photo of the separation document between Wang Xiaozhi and Wu Kunyu, the photo of the plaintiff's separation document, and the receipt for 3,000 yuan. He stated that since the plaintiff was not born to the defendant's father, and the defendant's father and the plaintiff's biological mother Wu Kunyu only cohabited and were not married, the plaintiff cannot claim a share of the defendant's property. The court summoned the plaintiff Wang Suying, who denied writing the separation document and receiving the 3,000 yuan. The official ordered her to write numbers to compare handwriting. The plaintiff's biological mother, Wu Kunyu, was also summoned to testify, stating that she married Wang Xiaozhi at the age of 24, moved into his residence, and gave birth to the plaintiff at the age of 26, followed by a son and a daughter, who both died young. She stated that the wedding to Wang took place at Dengxian Lane, Burke Road. At this point, the court considered the facts clear and ordered the lawyers of both parties to argue, then announced the conclusion and set the pronouncement for the 19th.</p>

<p>Lu Yang, a 24-year-old woman from Gaoyou, residing at No. 11, Wangjiazhai, Lujiabang, Nanshi, had a son named Da Duozi, six years old. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month around 8:00 PM, the child was playing at the door and suddenly disappeared. He was abducted by Zhang Yanlin from Qingjiang, who lived in the attic of the same house, in collusion with his friend Shen Huayu. They deceived him into the vicinity of the Great West Ward of the French Concession and hid him in the Xixing Hotel on Dongmulaihuo Street, where Shen Huayu guarded him, waiting for a boat to sell him to Xiamen, Fujian. After her beloved son disappeared, Lu Wu reported the abduction to the Dongjiadu Police Station and searched everywhere without success. Unexpectedly, Shi Yongquan, a detective from the 16th Shop Detective Squad, discovered the abduction by Zhang Yanlin and Shen Huayu and their attempt to sell the child. He reported the information to Squad Leader Dong Mingde, who assigned leaders Zhao Renxin and Wu Songshan, who arrested Zhang on the afternoon before yesterday around 7:00 PM. Zhang confessed without denial. They then took Zhang to the Xixing Hotel to arrest his accomplice Shen Huayu and rescue the child Lu Da Duozi. They brought them back to the team for interrogation and confirmed the crime. They then transferred them to the Dongjiadu Police Station for submission to the headquarters for review.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Development of Love to Adjust Marital Feelings <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>A vigorous man is a woman's ideal partner, offering boundless happiness. Weak youths should quickly awaken and seek comprehensive strategies to escape this predicament. Underdevelopment, impotence, and premature ejaculation undoubtedly plunge wives into an abyss of vexation, making lasting harmony unattainable.</p>
<p>A vigorous man is a woman's ideal partner. A man's physical strength is not only the foundation for adjusting marital feelings, but also the source of the most natural and joyful initiative in sexual encounters, a fact no one dares to deny. Therefore, seeking knowledge to develop love is of utmost importance to couples. From the answers of countless disappointed women, we obtain an undeniable truth: they unanimously agree that a man's muscle strength is the cornerstone of their happiness and success. All men should understand this truth. Thus, physically weak men cannot create marital happiness and are, of course, not welcomed by their wives!</p>
<p>Numerous renowned scholars worldwide have described the advantages and disadvantages in detail in their writings to warn weak men. To enter this paradise of love, they should seek strategies to escape their predicament, specifically referring to young men lacking physical strength.</p>
<p>There are countless ways to describe the causes of male physical weakness. The real reasons are too numerous to list. For example, excessive indulgence in masturbation during youth can severely hinder overall development, leading to an exceptionally small sexual organ, resulting in underdevelopment and weak sexual performance. Impotence and premature ejaculation after marriage undoubtedly plunge wives into an abyss of vexation. Furthermore, weak will and unrestrained debauchery during youth can lead to venereal diseases like gonorrhea, damaging the prostate and seminal vesicles that control seminal fluid, fundamentally shaking the reproductive glands that govern sexual function. Premature ejaculation, impotence, and nocturnal emission are symptoms induced by the aforementioned causes. Therefore, when a man unfortunately suffers from these defects, cracks naturally appear in a happy family, resulting in many unexpected disputes and tragedies. Regarding this point, we sincerely hope that wise couples will pay special attention, reflect deeply, and seek treatment promptly. In Europe and America, excellent gonadotropin preparations, "Organon," are used for fundamental treatment of premature ejaculation and impotence. Over 90% of those infected with gonorrhea are treated with pigment and vaccine preparations, "Anti-Gon," while "Spermoton Tablets" are used to stop spermatorrhea, with effective results and often leading to short-term cures.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Treatment for Neurasthenia Caused by Masturbation <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>First, abstain from masturbation to stop seminal emission. Strengthening the spermatic duct is the most advanced treatment.</p>
<p>The term "neurasthenia" was first used in 1880 by Dr. Beard of New York City. It is one of the most common diseases in modern civilized society. It is easily manifested after physical overwork, mental distress, or excessive study. Furthermore, young people who masturbate excessively, causing hypersensitivity in the ejaculation center, experience nocturnal emission every night or even premature ejaculation during the day. The main symptoms of this condition are sleep disturbances, attention deficit, memory loss, and headaches. Other symptoms may include headaches, fatigue, irritability, dizziness, and tinnitus. The above is an overview of neurasthenia. Its numerous symptoms and great harm can thus be inferred.</p>
<p>Regarding the fundamental treatment of this condition, one must first abstain from masturbation, avoid overwork, and appreciate natural scenery such as mountains and rivers to broaden the mind, while also paying attention to medication. Common medications used to treat neurasthenia are bromide preparations, which have side effects and cannot be taken continuously; otherwise, they become habit-forming and worsen the condition. Therefore, they are no longer trusted by physicians. Recently, the method of strengthening the spermatic duct has been adopted, with great efficacy. The cause of this condition is purely due to seminal emission caused by masturbation. Therefore, famous sexologists from various countries, such as Professor Delin of Berlin University and Dr. Wilson of the United States, use "Spermoton Tablets" to treat seminal emission at its root, while also using the true gonadotropin preparation "Organon" to remedy all the weakness caused by seminal emission. Therefore, this treatment method is superior to all others.</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Disease Lecture</p>
<p>— Compiled by Dr. Yao Er-chang and Dr. Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>Clinic: 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Lead to Disastrous Consequences</p>
<p>Patient Qiu Guo-xun, 43 years old, from Hangzhou, complains of insomnia every night, dizziness in the morning, and extreme weakness. Medical history: During his youth, he had a habit of masturbation for about three years, doing it every day. Although he later forcibly abstained, seminal emission resulted from it and was never cured despite repeated treatments. After marriage, excessive sexual activity led to premature ejaculation and impotence, which were difficult to avoid, resulting in a progressively weakened body. Since the age of 40, he has been unable to support himself and is now in a state of kidney weakness, with reproductive glands losing their lively and vigorous metabolic function, abnormal endocrine function, and fatigue. Treatment: A large dose of the true gonadotropin preparation "Organon" was prescribed, along with electrotherapy. After six to seven weeks, the reproductive glands were strengthened, the kidneys were filled, and the sexual nerves regained their inherent sensitivity, resulting in a happy mood and unparalleled healthy sexual activity. As a result, his wife became pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) Masturbation and Seminal Emission Lead to Loss of Health</p>
<p>Patient Pang Mei-sun, 21 years old, from Zhenjiang, complains that five years ago, while studying at a school in this city, he was induced by roommates to play with his sexual organs to ejaculate for pleasure. Initially unaware of the harm, he was further misled by pornographic books and pictures. He developed a habit from experimentation, and if he did not indulge, frequent seminal emissions occurred, once every two nights. Over the past four or five years, his body has become thin and weak, his complexion sallow, his spirit weak, and he has lost all vitality, showing a state of decline. He is ashamed and worried. Medical history: He began masturbating at the age of 16 and developed seminal emission in less than half a year, first nocturnal emission and recently spermatorrhea without dreams, meaning that even slight exertion during the day leads to seminal emission, which cannot be stopped. He is extremely anxious as his marriage is imminent. Current condition: Weak reproductive glands, insecure spermatic duct, and abnormal endocrine function. Treatment: First, "Spermoton Tablets" were prescribed to stop seminal emission and strengthen the spermatic duct, followed by "Organon" to promote the healthy prosperity of the reproductive glands' endocrine function, producing vigorous new cells, along with electrotherapy. After two months of treatment, his condition has been cured.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Both "Organon" and "Spermoton Tablets" are packaged in iron boxes. Be careful not to mistakenly purchase counterfeit medicines in paper boxes or bottles to avoid harming your health.)</p>
<p>Premature Aging</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shi-fang from Yuncheng, Hedong, Shanxi, writes: I have suffered from seminal emission for five years without a cure, leading to neurasthenia, back pain, insomnia, gray hair, sallow complexion, and blood deficiency, showing a state of premature aging. After taking "Spermoton Tablets," the seminal emission began to be treated, and after taking "Organon," the symptoms of weakness subsided.</p>
<p>Chronic Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Wen-guang from No. 64 Chongshan Lane, West Gate, this city, writes: My wife has always been weak and suffered from chronic leukorrhea, which has been ineffective despite seeing many doctors. She felt deeply distressed. After purchasing a box of "Leukorrhea Remedy" from Wuzhou Pharmacy and using it externally according to instructions, unexpectedly, it was completely cured. After taking "Organon" for women, her body has recovered to be healthy and strong, no longer as weak as before.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Shun-cai from Guangxing Store, Weihaiwei Road, writes: My mother and I both suffer from stomach problems, indigestion, and stabbing pain, which has been ineffective despite seeing many doctors. Fortunately, a relative from the countryside advised us to take "Stomach Pain Remedy" and "Digestive Tablets." After taking them, the stomach pain immediately subsided, and our appetite suddenly doubled. Feeling that the medicine is surprisingly effective, I am writing this to introduce it to those with the same ailment.</p>

<p>Common Knowledge About Bone Pain</p>

<p>— Contributed by Jiang Sen</p>
<p>This happened two months ago. I lay in bed, resentfully saying: The bone pain is getting worse, what should I do? I can't even move straight. The biggest problem is how will I go to work? If I don't go, I'll have to see the manager's ugly face and tell him that I can't move because of bone pain, which he won't believe. But if I go, the pain is really unbearable. Forget it! I'll prepare to quit my job and definitely not go... I was planning like this when suddenly my good friend Jianfan came. He pushed open the door and said, "I came to see what's wrong with you. You've been on leave for many days. Is your bone pain any better? If not, I have a bottle of bone pain medicine here that you can try." I listlessly replied that it's still the same today, and there's no good medicine now, just some unscientific bird medicines. I don't want it. Jianfan retorted, "Don't underestimate this bottle of medicine. It's a bone pain medicine invented by Dr. Johnston in America. New York medical journals even carry texts praising its great efficacy, calling it the sacred medicine for bone pain. My father had this disease, and after taking this for less than two months, the bone pain was cured." I accepted his kindness and tried it every day. Sure enough, in less than two months, the bone pain was cured, and my limbs and joints were much better than before I had bone pain. That's a worthy page to recall in my sickbed diary.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Insights on Female Fitness and Pregnancy Techniques <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zhang Jun-shi</p>
<p>Well-developed breasts are the soul of fitness, and a full figure is the body of beauty. One hundred and fifty infertile women in the country seek medical remedies to become pregnant.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, nations can no longer survive and propagate without health. Health is not only a problem that everyone cannot ignore, but also something that everyone should strive to achieve. In Europe and America, women have an exceptionally rich understanding of fitness. They recognize that the development of breasts creates the soul of fitness, and a full figure constitutes the body of beauty, so they can use various scientific methods to achieve the standard of fitness and beauty.</p>
<p>The only scientific medication that European and American girls rely on to help breast development is the gonadotropin preparation "Organon" for women. This was invented by Austrian physiology master Steinach. In 1933, Dr. Alan of France and famous German doctor Duaki used this preparation on mice, which increased the breasts of female mice. This experiment has been completely successful. It also has the same effect on castrated guinea pigs. Therefore, the world-renowned British beauty expert Rachel said: "Organon for women" has undoubtedly achieved success in female fitness. Because it has been clinically tested by countless experts, first on mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, monkeys, and humans, it has been proven to be effective. Its function not only helps the development of a part of the breasts, but also has effects on the uterus, fallopian tubes, vagina, vulva, menstrual symptoms, and pregnancy function. The experiment is not only visible to the naked eye, but can also be confirmed histologically. If normal animals undergo castration surgery, the reproductive glands will enter a state of weakness, and the cells will shrink. If gonadotropin preparations are supplemented at this time, complete regeneration will occur. Therefore, in foreign countries, there are many widowed women who not only have shriveled breasts and irregular menstruation, but also have a haggard appearance and completely lose their rosy and charming complexion. After taking this excellent "Organon" for women, they completely transformed—their breasts became erect, their menstruation was regulated, and their skin and appearance were filled with lively and moist vitality. Therefore, the famous Italian doctor Knaus often recommends this preparation to women as an anti-aging treatment. In the past year, famous German doctor Duaki used this preparation to treat 2,764 women with weak and underdeveloped breasts and 3,945 women with irregular menstruation. In addition, after 150 infertile women took "Organon," 28 of them had children after 300 days, and after 14 months, 70% of them, or 105, had given birth.</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Bad Consequences of Untreated Acute Gonorrhea <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Da-chao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Acute gonorrhea is generally considered the best opportunity for patients to seek treatment. From a medical perspective, it is indeed relatively easy to cure completely. However, all complications of gonorrhea, such as orchitis, prostatitis, arthritis, cystitis, and stubborn and difficult-to-treat chronic gonorrhea, are the bad consequences of untreated acute gonorrhea. Although it is more difficult for patients to reach this stage, if they pay attention to health preservation, carefully choose their diet, and take the pigment and vaccine combination preparation "Anti-Gon," the gonococci lurking deep in the body's urethra will be wiped out in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Based on many years of experience, German Dr. Jetson extracted the essence of pigments and incorporated the vaccine components of anti-toxic bacteria through scientific research to create the special gonorrhea medicine "Anti-Gon." The superiority of this medicine over all others lies in its truly effective sterilization through the membrane, without any irritation to the stomach, intestines, or kidneys. It is indeed a symptomatic and effective medicine for acute and chronic gonorrhea and complications in both men and women, comparable to the famous Salvarsan 606 for syphilis for a time.</p>
<p>Patient Xu Mei, residing at No. 159, Gansidong Road, this city, a female, was infected by her husband and suffered from gonorrheal leukorrhea. I treated her with the pigment and vaccine combination preparation "Anti-Gon" and used "Leukorrhea Remedy" externally to stop the leukorrhea. In less than a week, she no longer felt pain when urinating. She took two boxes of "Anti-Gon" and one box of "Leukorrhea Remedy," and was completely cured. (Editor's note: For female leukorrhea, combining with "Leukorrhea Remedy" will speed up the effectiveness.)</p>
<p>Smoking Cessation Experience</p>
<h3 id="e187">The League of Nations' Steps to Ban Smoking <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiao-han</p>
<p>The harm of opium can affect the survival of an entire nation. Not only that, it can create sharp reefs in the path of human prosperity. Therefore, the laws banning smoking that various countries impose on their people are different. However, in order to quickly eradicate this drug, the great powers, in addition to punishment, also use scientific methods to overcome the difficulties of quitting smoking. The health group of the League of Nations is the only organization that seeks the welfare of member countries. Indeed, all facilities and all plans have been rigorously reviewed, so governments of all countries also regard them as golden rules, unlike other administrative bills and economic sanctions, etc., which are opposed by various countries. At the 32nd conference of the League of Nations in Geneva this year, Chairman Bounde M.D. proposed a method to promote smoking cessation, using "Organon" as the main medicine, supplemented by injections of "Vitamycin Life Preserver." The 52 member countries unanimously passed this method of cessation, which is in line with the physical condition of addicts. The reason is that the whole body of smokers, especially the reproductive glands, the source of life, is occupied by the drug, and the original resistance is completely anesthetized. After taking this, the body is strengthened, and the newly generated sperm is sufficient to resist the drug. All damages are restored, so they can safely quit. This method has been adopted by Britain, France, and the United States. All prisoners arrested for smoking opium are treated with this method to help them quit. After three months of implementation, the number of smokers has been greatly reduced. This year, Germany has also adopted it. Seventy percent of the arrested smokers have been quit by this method. Furthermore, the number of British prisoners who have been quit is about 80 percent or more, France about 90 percent or more, and the United States about 95 percent or more. Many hospitals in our country are also using this method. Last winter, I found that the number of Japanese smokers who were treated was not small, about 75 percent or more.</p>

<p>Special Issue for the Relocation and Opening of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's Head Office</p>
<h3 id="e188">An Abbreviated History and Remarks of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's Shanghai General Distribution Office <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company was established in the late years of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty, pioneering the cigarette industry in our country. Subsequently, many followed suit, but the scale and vision of the former remains unmatched to this day. The head office is located in Shanghai, with branches in various provinces of China, as well as Hong Kong, Java, Surabaya, Batavia, Singapore, and Siam in Nanyang. Factories were established in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankou, and Liaoning, employing a total of 20,000 to 30,000 male and female workers. The annual output is approximately 200,000 large cases, with a business value of approximately 30 to 40 million national currency. The company bears approximately 10 million yuan in national unified taxes, significantly impacting the national economy and people's livelihood. Its history and glory are well-known to Chinese scholars discussing the domestic tobacco industry. Today, as the Shanghai General Distribution Office of the company moves to its new location at No. 25 Guizhou Road and holds its opening ceremony, we further inform the people of the country about the evolution and history of the General Distribution Office. Tracing back to the emergence of domestically produced cigarettes in Shanghai, the ten-cigarette pack of "Flying Boat" brand from the Nanyang Tobacco Company was the pioneer. However, at that time, only Guangdong food stores in the Hongkou and Wuchang Road areas occasionally sold it, as the cigarettes were manufactured in Hong Kong and only brought over in small quantities by sailors on ships between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Smokers and vendors could not obtain them in large quantities. In the third year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chen Caibao, a member of the cigarette industry, recognizing the significant annual outflow of funds due to imported cigarettes in Shanghai, united with more than ten local businesses, including Kaitai, Xiangdelong, Changdelong, Dasheng, Tongyoufeng, Chen Wanfeng, Xiefeng, Yongfeng, and Shaotongyu, to pool capital and establish a distribution office. This office directly ordered goods from the Nanyang Head Office in Hong Kong and transported them to Shanghai to compete with imported products. Within a few months, sales gradually increased, and this distribution office became the precursor to today's General Distribution Office. At that time, Mr. Jian Zhaonan, the founder and general manager of the Nanyang Head Office, was planning to establish a branch in Shanghai as the first step in developing the domestic tobacco market in Central and Northern China. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, a location was found at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road (now the address of the Henderley Clock and Watch General Store) to establish the Shanghai Nanyang Tobacco Company. A manufacturing plant was also planned at the intersection of Broadway Road and Zhaofeng Road. The cigarettes sold along the coast could be supplied by the Shanghai factory, benefiting both manufacturing and sales. The distribution part of the business was actually under the Shanghai branch. These events occurred between the fifth, sixth, and seventh years of the Republic of China. By the eighth year, the company was fully expanded and reorganized. The head office was moved to Shanghai, choosing another location at No. 12 Nanjing Road, while the original location at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road became the Shanghai Distribution Office, responsible for business in Shanghai. In the tenth year, a distribution office was established on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, called the North Distribution Office. The one at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road was called the South Distribution Office, with the Wusong River and Suzhou River as the boundary, managing business affairs in the north and south of Shanghai respectively. In the eleventh year, the North Distribution Office was merged into the South Distribution Office. Thus, the name "General Distribution Office" was officially established. From the twelfth to the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the General Distribution Office was renamed "Shanghai Bureau" twice, referred to as the "Bureau System," once renamed "Shanghai Baosongtai Section," referred to as the "Section System," and once changed to "Xintaihe Agency," referred to as the "General Agency System." Its address moved once to No. 16 Yuanyuan Lane on Tianjin Road, then to No. 399 Songshou Lane on Beijing Road, and then to Zhengjia Wood Bridge on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. The initial heads were Li Jingsuo, Jian Yinchu, and Hu Zijin, followed by Chen Caibin, Rong Yaoqu, Sun Lishan, Zhao Zuyi, Jiang Zhengqing, and Huang Jieheng. From the twenty-second year of the Republic of China to the present, Mr. Wu Dingju has been appointed, with Wei Ronghui and Wu Jingshan assisting him. The above is the past history of the General Distribution Office over the past decade, generally adapting to the environment and trends of the time. The employees, retailers, and the company have formed an inseparable bond. With long experience, they have gained more expertise, and with long-term cooperation, their feelings have become closer. Therefore, the products of the Nanyang Tobacco Company are becoming increasingly refined, and the sales of the Nanyang Tobacco Company are improving daily. This can be seen from the General Distribution Office, which is not achieved by chance. Shanghai is the hub of national commerce and a pioneer in the flow of goods. Any new product, whether foreign or domestic, must be sold in Shanghai before it can be sold throughout the country. In the cigarette industry, the government also designated Shanghai as the location for manufacturing plants, ahead of Tianjin, Hankou, and Qingdao. When the Nanyang Company arrived in Shanghai, foreign cigarettes already had a dominant position. The Nanyang Company reclaimed a place in the market through hard work and struggle. Before branch offices and warehouses could be established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangxi, and even the three northeastern provinces, they all relied on the General Distribution Office for support. At the peak of domestic cigarette factories in Shanghai, there were about 150 to 160 factories. However, they were subsequently suppressed by foreign goods dumping and tax system restrictions, and only 30 to 40 factories remain today. The Nanyang Company has worked hard to support and fight tirelessly. In Shanghai, the General Distribution Office has put in the most effort and achieved the most significant results. Every new trademark launched by the Nanyang Company has been promoted and launched by the General Distribution Office. There are over a hundred types, all with outstanding reputations. People in the north and south are accustomed to smoking them, and they are ingrained in their minds, often making it impossible to switch to other brands. Notable examples include Little and Big White Gold Dragon, Mei Lanfang, Seven Stars, Little and Big Great Wall, Linked Beads, Patriotic, Red Gold Dragon, Hundred Birds, Happy Birds, High Tower, Crab Beauty, Golden Axe, and Eight Corners, which are popular products throughout the north and south. Recently, the ten-pack Red Gold Dragon in Shanghai has adapted to social needs, offering affordable prices and good quality, with almost every household having them. The General Distribution Office's relocation includes the distribution of top-quality fifty-pack and ten-pack Big White Gold Dragon cigarettes with special discount coupons to thank the people for their welcome and support. Its sales have recently extended overseas, spreading rapidly without promotion, which is unmatched by other cigarettes. The internal organization of the General Distribution Office is similar to that of branch offices in various regions, but its position in Shanghai is particularly important. Initially, it only managed business within a hundred miles of Shanghai. Last year, it also managed Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province. This year, it also manages the four warehouses in Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Xinpu. Furthermore, merchants from Xinjiang, Guizhou, and other provinces who purchase and sell goods locally are also attached to it. With long journeys and distant management, its affairs are becoming increasingly complex. Mr. Wu Dingju, the current head, has been working at the Nanyang Company for over ten years. He trained in the Shanghai West and Pudong factories for several years. Every year, the company sends personnel to Shandong and Henan to purchase tobacco leaves, and he often participates in this task. He has also managed the Hangzhou office for several years. He has extensive experience in manufacturing and business, both in theory and practice. With the assistance of Mr. Wei Ronghui and Mr. Wu Jingshan, the business of the General Distribution Office will surely prosper even more. The General Manager of the Nanyang Company, Mr. Jian Yujie, can be said to be thorough and appropriate in his selection of personnel. In recent years, all industries have declined, and the business community has fallen into a state of depression. Foreign goods have attacked, and Shanghai is at the forefront of this. The domestic cigarette business is currently facing one of its most serious and difficult days. In addition, the country is in crisis, and the domestic market is flooded with illicit cigarettes. Small stalls along the remote roads of the concessions sell hand-rolled cigarettes, relying on impoverished livelihoods, which the government is unable to control. They evade national taxes and counterfeit trademarks, without exception. However, the rolling paper used for these so-called illicit cigarettes and hand-rolled cigarettes is reportedly smuggled by a certain foreigner, who also prints brand names to supply them. Even in the small matter of a cigarette, people use all kinds of tricks to scheme against us, like mercury seeping into every crevice. The national economy and people's livelihood are significantly affected, which is further proof. We hope that fellow members of the domestic cigarette industry and those who purchase domestic cigarettes will pay attention to this quickly. This is not just the loss of one company or the responsibility of one or two individuals.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Advocating for Domestic Cigarettes <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jinglu</p>
<p>I have often heard that treading on frost leads to solid ice, and accumulated water can erode stone. Calamities easily arise from neglect, and changes often occur unexpectedly. Minor ailments can affect the heart, and a gentle breeze can spread across the universe. One should not neglect things simply because they seem small or insignificant. Cigarettes are extremely fine and insignificant, and the world generally considers them trivial, with the lingering fragrance and fleeting smoke having no connection to grand principles. However, one should know that foreign cigarettes are sold throughout the country, with deep-rooted habits reaching rural areas. The money spent by Chinese people on these cigarettes flows overseas like smoke, amounting to hundreds of millions each year, which is beyond the consideration of the general public. It is truly frightening how a small spark can start a prairie fire, and how a trickle, if not stopped, will become a river!</p>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company is the pioneer of self-made cigarettes in our country and a giant in the Chinese cigarette industry. The excellence of its products and the grandeur of its scale are enough to surpass foreign merchants, turning foreign products into dung. Those who monopolize and profiteer are forced to stand cautiously, watching with sideways glances, feeling like they are sitting on pins and needles and have thorns in their backs, no longer able to snore peacefully in their beds. This is something that our country, facing many difficulties and lagging behind in many aspects, should take as a source of consolation.</p>
<p>Some may argue that cigarettes merely cause Chinese people to waste huge sums of money each year and are merely a consumption product with no need for advocacy or encouragement. Moreover, at a time when we are surrounded by enemies and hanging by a thread, we should vigorously practice new lifestyle disciplines, without懈怠or弛懈. Why waste useful money on useless extravagance? This argument is indeed startling and makes sense. However, if we consider the facts, if we could get all Chinese people to abstain from cigarettes, that would be fine. But if that is not the case, should we simply watch people send hundreds of millions of dollars away each year and remain indifferent? If this continues, others will become richer while we become poorer, others will be the knife and chopping board while we are the fish and meat. This is precisely why ambitious people feel慷慨 and忧伤, and think day and night about挽回利权 and杜塞漏巵in every possible way. Therefore, the establishment of the Nanyang Tobacco Company is to meet the needs of the Chinese people and cultivate the vitality of the nation, and it is something that cannot be dispensed with or delayed!</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that if foreign cigarettes are not eliminated from the market, then domestic cigarettes must be promoted to resist them. It is best for Chinese people not to smoke cigarettes at all, but if they do, they must choose domestic products over foreign ones. To take back what was lost, to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, is a second-best option. As for its ability to aid literary thoughts and dispel worries, that is just a minor benefit.</p>
<p>Now that the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's General Distribution Office is moving to a new location, a special publication will be compiled in commemoration. I express my views frankly here, not only because I appreciate it as a wonderful companion for tea and after-dinner drinks, but also because I am happy that it can be a sharp tool for杜塞漏巵.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Thoughts on the Relocation and Opening of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company General Distribution Office <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Running a business is like building a nation. Those who succeed possess patriotism and love for the people, along with unique insights and unwavering courage. I deeply admire the Jian brothers for establishing the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company.</p>
<p>Merchants typically pursue profit, but perceptions of profit vary. Some have a broad vision, while others have a narrow one. Such differences in perspective are undeniable. Chinese merchants often share a negative habit: when one starts a business, others rush to imitate it. Soon, everyone joins the competition, even resorting to mimicking brand names and trademarks, disregarding ethics and laws. Such actions lead to mutual destruction and collapse. Even if they follow established paths, their gains remain minimal. This reflects a narrow perspective. A broader vision is different.</p>
<p>The cigarette industry originated with foreign merchants. People embraced cigarettes for their convenience, leading to their rapid popularity. Traditional Chinese tobacco products, like water pipes, gradually declined. Merchants in those industries failed to unite and innovate. Few visionary leaders emerged to challenge foreign companies. This allowed foreign cigarette companies to seize our profits and grow stronger. This is a painful example of the shallowness of Chinese merchants. The Jian brothers were different.</p>
<p>The Jian brothers possessed patriotism and love for the people. They used foreign capital to revitalize domestic commerce. Their vision and insight were exceptional. When the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company began in Shanghai, China was boycotting foreign goods. To succeed, domestic goods needed to compete with foreign products, requiring sufficient resources. Understanding this, the Jians worked tirelessly, increasing capital and improving product quality. Despite facing setbacks, they persevered and succeeded in challenging foreign dominance.</p>
<p>The rise of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company also spurred the emergence of other Chinese cigarette companies. The Chinese cigarette industry thrived, gradually diminishing the influence of foreign companies.</p>
<p>Before the Nanyang Company, foreign companies dominated the market, reaping enormous profits. Although some taxes were paid, the state's revenue remained minimal. With the rise of Nanyang, cigarette taxes steadily increased. Chinese merchants eagerly paid taxes, and foreign companies followed suit. Before the Republic, cigarette tax revenue was insignificant. Now, cigarette taxes contribute significantly to the national treasury. Besides the government, countless workers and merchants benefit directly or indirectly. Generous donations were also made to education, disaster relief, and cultural causes. This exemplifies the embodiment of patriotism and love for the people. The Jian brothers are truly giants in the business world. This essay commemorates the relocation of the Nanyang Company's General Distribution Office and expresses my personal views.</p>
<h3 id="e192">White Gold Dragon and I <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Naihong</p>
<p>Cigarettes hold an increasingly significant place in commerce. This isn't an exaggeration, as evidenced by their booming presence in newspapers. Especially during this era of promoting domestic goods, their popularity stems from a deep, almost imaginative understanding of their relationship with human life. Simply put, the connection between cigarettes and people is becoming more permanent and intimate.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are not just necessities in social settings or after-dinner treats. They possess a magical power to stimulate thought. Writers often rely on them as aids, guiding them with a gentleness and intrigue surpassing even modern matchmakers.</p>
<p>I've been smoking cigarettes for only three years, yet I haven't spent a day without them.</p>
<p>As I exhale a delicate cloud of smoke, it envelops the surrounding space, and my eyes focus on everything imagined in my mind. Suddenly, beautiful scenes unfold in an orderly manner. Only those who enjoy smoking can truly appreciate such divine pleasure.</p>
<p>I smoke the top-notch domestic brand "White Gold Dragon." It has been my companion for three years. It fulfills its mission to comfort me, leaving a deep impression. Let me briefly share my thoughts on its qualities and character:</p>
<p>"Its slender and elegant cigarette stick resembles a young woman's figure. The golden, high-quality tobacco is flavorful and refreshing. It's exquisite and beautiful, a perfect companion for solitude. It can enhance thought, improve health, and is affordable, surpassing foreign brands by a hundredfold. Truly a leader among domestic goods, I recommend everyone befriend it. You will surely benefit immensely."</p>
<p>I hear the Nanyang Tobacco Company plans to move to a propitious location, promising renewed progress and greater momentum to unleash the brilliant glory of domestic goods. This is fortunate for the nation and its people.</p>
<p>Having finished this piece, I am even more grateful to "White Gold Dragon Cigarettes" for the assistance provided (at Dabeizi).</p>
<h3 id="e193">Human Life and Cigarettes <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Rongfang</p>
<p>In terms of material consumption, the mainstays of human life are food, cotton cloth, and silk. In terms of spiritual consumption, they are culture, faith, and art. When combined, these two aspects propel human life towards a higher stage – sophistication. As such, we cannot neglect either of them.</p>
<p>Plain cotton cloth represents pure material, untouched by spiritual influence. However, once it is woven with patterns or printed with designs, it becomes beautiful and appealing. It then fulfills the dual needs of human life, making it appealing to mischievous younger siblings. Similarly, plain wheat flour, when simply made into solid buns, represents a product devoid of spiritual power. However, when skilled chefs use their artistic flair to create a variety of elaborate pastries, they cater to the palates of young ladies and gentlemen. From this, we can infer that spiritual and material aspects are equally important in human life – although some occasionally prioritize spiritual life over material, even willing to consume coarse rice in order to accommodate their higher beliefs. This we can only归纳到别一问题上去说了.</p>
<p>Considering the dual needs of human life reminds us of cigarettes. While some may see cigarettes as meaningless consumables, they are in fact a unique product that combines material and spiritual aspects in the context of human life. While we certainly cannot subsist solely on cigarettes all day long, they are an indispensable necessity in the appropriate time and context. One needs only to pay a little attention in various settings to understand that there is a solid theoretical foundation behind their existence.</p>
<p>Cigarettes can be divided into domestic and foreign varieties, but in reality, there is no difference. Those who believe foreign cigarettes are superior to domestic ones likely subscribe to the notion that the foreign moon is brighter than the Chinese one.</p>
<p>Among the manufacturers of domestic cigarettes, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company is widely recognized as the most reputable and historically significant in China. Therefore, their products, regardless of quality or packaging, surpass ordinary cigarettes, as everyone imagines.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Congratulating Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Its Relocation and Opening <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>

<h3 id="e195">Practicing What You Preach <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Wenhua</p>
<p>"He who wishes to govern his state must first regulate his family; he who wishes to regulate his family must first cultivate his person." Thus, the relationship between the person and the state is as close as the relationship between a finger and an arm! At present, the cries for national salvation are resounding, with advocacy for the use of domestic products, promotion, exhibitions, and movements. The main purpose of these methods is to practice what you preach and protect domestic goods. However, do the Chinese people truly fulfill their duty to practice what they preach when it comes to domestic goods? Cigarettes have long been imported from Europe and America. Chinese people favor them for their convenience, leading to their widespread popularity. In a short time, this trend became widespread, and the outflow of money each year surpassed even that of oil and matches. Patriotic people at that time felt worried, and they initiated the establishment of factories to manufacture and supply society. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company was established in Shanghai and Hong Kong, with branch offices set up throughout the country. The abundant products were sufficient to control imported goods, becoming popular worldwide and dominating East Asia. For over several decades, it has held the bull's ear in the cigarette industry. If not for the Chinese people's protection of domestic goods and concerted efforts, how could this have been achieved? However, domestic factories are now prepared, and domestic cigarettes are now made. All of us Chinese people should strengthen our ambitions, work together to achieve strength for our country, and block漏巵in the economic flow. In all social interactions, gifts, receptions, and banquets, serve domestic cigarettes, and advocate to the public to open up the茅塞of the愚者and enlighten the kidney's interests and harms. To save the nation and seek survival, practicing what you preach to achieve the effect of指臂is also appropriate? The weakness of a country is like the weakness of a person. The people's economy cannot fill its treasury, just as the limbs cannot harmonize with the blood. Therefore, every person is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, and promoting domestic goods is also a way to save the nation, a small responsibility that we people are still unable to carry out. If we abandon our writing brushes and join the army, guarding the country with weapons, there will be no 纶矣. In recent years, the national economy has been strained, and foreign goods have been dumped. Those who sing high 　者 cause this to happen. At this critical moment of survival, I hope that we will shoulder and carry out our responsibility to save the country through domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Night Ramblings <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Mingzhang</p>
<p>(Collected from the brand names of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company)</p>
<p>"Great Happiness" indeed came as promised, along with her two younger sisters, "Double Happiness" and "Four Happiness", hand-in-hand, approaching gracefully. Smiles bloomed on my face, and I rushed to greet them, wanting to make my beloved feel satisfied and happy. I flattered them, saying like a toady, "The weather is very clear tonight, how about we go to a more distant place to play?" Fortunately, the three sisters favored me, and agreed without hesitation. Moreover, I could tell from their expressions that they were very happy and interested, which made me even more delighted. I quickly made a phone call to the "Airplane" field in Longhua, instructing them to release an "Airship", and we flew high above the "Earth".</p>
<p>In the sky, we enjoyed the scenery above the clouds. Because it was around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon was particularly "Bright." Looking closely, we could vaguely see two "Brothers" inside, wielding a "Golden Axe" to chop down a large tree, with a large "Cat" lying beside them, enjoying the spectacle. Suddenly, with a thunderous sound in the sky, fifty large "Platinum Dragon" cigarettes and ten small "Platinum Dragon" cigarettes flew over, along with "Red Golden Dragon" cigarettes, bulging their eyes and opening their mouths in a state of wanting to devour us. We were all extremely frightened, so scared that we dared not move. We just urged the pilot to drive faster. I secretly thought to myself, the Heavenly Palace must be afraid that we would "Leak Heavenly Secrets" (?).</p>
<p>The "Airship" flew very fast, and in a blink of an eye, we arrived in North China. The "Great Wall" and "Small Wall" lay coiled like snakes, big and small, on the high mountains. On the mountains were "High Towers" and "Pagodas" standing tall into the clouds. Inside the towers, they were performing Peking Opera, "The Cowherd and Weaver Girl Meeting on the Magpie Bridge", with "Magpies" that could transform into a bridge, "Seven Stars" lanterns, and "Mei Lanfang's" authentic billboard. There were many people watching. Tickets only cost "Thirty Cents" and "Eighty Cents", two types.</p>
<p>Flying past the Great Wall and heading east, passing through Shenyang, Changchun and other places, we arrived at Changbai Mountain, where ginseng is produced. At the foot of the mountain, we saw several "Hundred Birds" and "Golden Deer" running back and forth. The summit was precipitous, and at the highest point stood a "Flower Queen", said to be transformed from a "Beauty," so the flowers that bloomed were also very delicate and beautiful.</p>
<p>Because I still had to go to the "Bank" as usual to work tomorrow morning, I instructed the driver to return by the original route.</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped off the airship, I felt dizzy and disoriented. I bought a box of "Small Linked Pearls" cigarettes at a nearby cigarette shop and shared them with everyone.</p>
<p>This trip to North China indeed wasted a night, but what I gained was also good, making me deeply feel that North China is indeed a "Rich Country". However, the landscape remains the same, but the people are all different. How will the "Patriotic" youths take it back and complete the "Unification" of the country?</p>

<h3 id="e197">Yarn and Cotton: Each Profit-Taking, Swapping Positions; Standard Yarn Nears a Fall, Far Rises - This is Due to the Excessive Inversion <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has been rising for days, causing profit-takers to close out positions and a sudden reversal occurred, but confidence remained strong because the existing yarn was in short supply, and the spot settlement price was higher, so the bulls were still holding tight. However, most will abandon this month and move into distant months, so the near month is slightly flat and the forward month turns up.</p>
<p>This month's yarn fell by more than one yuan.</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened, and the spot month market rose by eight cents due to the panic of the shorts. November was not moved. When traded to distant months, the momentum turned firm, and some of the bulls took profits and swapped positions tightly. In the second round of trading, the near-month market was slack because yarn buyers were not purchasing aggressively, so the market price fell again and remained sluggish until the close. According to some, the price of Japanese yarn for the next month is seven or eight yuan lower than that of Chinese yarn, so some people have already shifted their focus. Shenji, Dachangcheng, Dachang, Yongchang, etc. sold, while Yuda, Huamao, Wang Taixing, Yichang, Changfeng, and Run Kang, etc. bought a lot. The near month was flat when the market opened in the afternoon, and the forward month fell slightly. The trading volume in the market was relatively low, so the market was stable. After the second round of trading, there were no major ups and downs. As a result, the near month rose by four cents compared to the morning closing price, and the forward month rose or fell by one or two cents. Jin Chang sold 1,700 bales, Dafu 850 bales, Geng Feng 700 bales, Chang Ji 900 bales, Xing Chang 700 bales, Fengtai 1,100 bales, Shen Ji 3,000 bales, Dachangcheng 4,650 bales, Dachang 1,500 bales, Yongchang 2,400 bales, and Shengyuan 850 bales. Heng Yi bought 1,100 bales, Yuda 1,100 bales, Huamao 3,450 bales, Wang Taixing 1,100 bales, Yichang 1,500 bales, Run Kang 4,000 bales, Sen Kang 1,700 bales, and Jinghua 1,600 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn sales are still 1,700 bales.</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that all trades purchased a total of 1,701 bales throughout the day, with the selling price being flat. The purchase amounts for each trade are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 335 Guangdong: 860</p>
<p>Shantou: 40 Tianjin: 565</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 10</p>
<h3 id="e198">Cotton Buying Enthusiasm Strong; All Months Except Spot Month Rise About Two Cents <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending stronger because the U.S. and Indian cotton markets have rebounded, and because those who previously sold cotton and bought yarn have already bought back to offset. In addition, the October futures delivery period is approaching, and although there is a large amount of coarse Russian cotton, the price is low, and buyers are eager to buy, so the market is rising. However, sources from all routes are gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Mingde's Arrival is Particularly Large</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened strong, with the bulls showing strong momentum and strong buying enthusiasm because the shorts had previously suppressed the market too fiercely, and the margin of those who sold cotton and bought yarn has now been offset and bought back, so the cotton market is particularly strong. However, the arrival of goods from all routes is gradually increasing. After the second round of trading, it fell step by step, but the factory demand is still not bad. Guangfeng, Shenchang, Fengtai, Shenji, Dachangcheng, and Yongchang, etc. sold wholesale, while Mingde, Xingchang, Yu, Changfeng, Xiesheng, Yongda, Xincheng, Yuanxingchang, Changfeng, and Yikang, etc. bought in large quantities. When the market opened in the afternoon, the spot month was flat and weak due to the large short position of large traders, but the trade to the forward month was hard. After the second round of trading, there was still no major change. As a result, each month rose by five cents to 1.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. Shenji sold 10,400 dan, Fengtai 4,200 dan, Yicheng 5,000 dan, Dachangcheng 3,600 dan, Yichang 2,700 dan, Run Kang 4,600 dan, Shenchang 8,300 dan, Geng Feng 16,800 dan, and Xiesheng 2,600 dan.

<p>The yarn and cotton market in the past week has been unusually active, with intense competition between bulls and bears. The standard yarn and cotton market situation is that the market price has advanced due to the development of autumn sales. The closing price of October standard yarn before Double Ten Day was 209 yuan, and the peak before yesterday was 216.9 yuan, an increase of 7.9 yuan. The October standard cotton price was 38.75 yuan, and the peak yesterday was 40.05 yuan, an increase of 1.75 yuan. The momentum of both bulls and bears is surging. In order to maintain stability, the exchange has increased the special margin requirement since yesterday. The brokers quickly transferred transactions last night in order to increase the special margin requirement. The cotton yarn transaction was 400,000 bales, and the cotton transaction was 800,000 dan. The development of the market transaction created a new record since the exchange opened. The handling fee for each bale of cotton yarn is 17.48 cents, and the total income for 400,000 bales is 69,920 yuan. The handling fee for each dan of cotton is 4.48 cents, and the total income for 800,000 dan is 35,840 yuan. The total handling fee income for yarn and cotton is 105,760 yuan. In addition, the total transaction volume of cotton yarn is 1,146,350 bales, and the total transaction volume of cotton is 2,900,700 dan. With this huge transaction margin, it is enough to invest in the heat, and the future storm is still in the raging waves.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. International financial development, domestic and foreign merchants, and Wall Street bought in, and each month rose by 6-12 points. Later, cotton farmers sold to hedge, and bulls closed out positions. At the same time, buyers saw good weather and were hesitant to increase hedging sales. Part of the market fell back, but the spot basis was firm, and demand was active. Before the close, France bought in, and the market price rose again. Spot prices rose by 16 points, and futures prices rose by 15-17 points. British spot cotton rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 5-9 points. Indian cotton rose initially due to strong demand for cloth, and merchants and shorts bought in, but later fell back due to some bulls closing out positions. Pingguo rose by half a rupee, and Aomula and Bairoxi rose by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (13th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the forecast for the 14th opening is Bairoxi at 220 rupees, up 1 rupee, Aomula at 197 rupees, up 0.75 rupees, and Pingguo at 156.5 rupees, up half a rupee.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, due to raw materials, yarn, and spot panic becoming increasingly serious, and the demand for cotton cloth from all routes is increasingly strong. Although the trend of standard yarn and cotton is slightly flat, the upward pressure on the cloth market is still strong. White heavy and light weight coarse cloth, and fine cloth from this factory are almost invisible in the market. Occasional small amounts of goods are sold, and the market price increases again (by 5 cents to 8 cents per piece). Fine twill from this factory also increases (by more than 10 cents per piece). Fine cloth, fine twill, ordinary cloth, and coarse cloth from East China increase (by 5 cents to 10 cents per piece). The rise of white velvet and printed velvet is even more intense, with an increase of (40-50 cents per piece). Spot sales from all trades are exceptionally good. For example, trades from Hankou, Chongqing, and other places are constantly sending telegrams to add more than a thousand boxes of printed velvet. Most of the maturing futures previously ordered by various factories need to be deferred, so new orders are not dared to be accepted rashly. However, Guangzhong Factory has slightly opened up futures for next month. The sale of coarse and fine cloths from this factory is sparse. Only Hengfeng Factory has opened 600 bales of 16-pound Five Cranes coarse cloth, which is a November futures, and 14-pound coarse cloth has also been opened. The price is increased by a huge 1.50-1.60 yuan (per piece) compared to the opening price in September. Because of the consistent lack of each brand in this street, Hengfeng's coarse cloth futures and spot goods have been absorbed a lot, with more than 500 pieces being transacted.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Autumn Woolen Cloth Sales are Very Strong; Transactions are Mostly Conducted by Those Who Have Joined the Association <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Woolen cloth transactions have been extremely prosperous recently. If it were not for the situation, business would surely be even more booming. The male and female colored woolen cloths required for autumn sales are being purchased by merchants from Hankou, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nanchang, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other ports. Those in the industry who have joined the association and registered with the customs are busy entertaining, transporting by post office and transport companies, and mostly trading in cash. Those who have not joined the association find business quite difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Finance: Anglo-American-French Monetary Agreement Established; Standard Gold Buying Enthusiasm Dissipated; Yesterday Fell Another 1.10 Yuan <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a decline of 1.10 yuan due to rumors of cooperation between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in buying and selling gold, and of a large loan from the central government. At the beginning of the morning, overseas silver markets in the United Kingdom and the United States were flat, and the Montevideo forward silver price was unchanged. Exchange rates were stable. London spot gold was flat. The central bank's posted rates were flat in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the customs surtax was unchanged. The posted price for standard gold was still 1154 yuan. Reports that the U.S. Treasury Secretary announced an Anglo-American-French monetary agreement, a new type of gold standard, the main effect of which was to transfer the right to buy and sell gold from irresponsible speculators to the government, kept exchange rates from fluctuating excessively, and stabilized the gold market. Large investors were passive. The off-market pre-trading price retreated to 50.5 yuan due to the availability of Hengyu for sale. Qiasheng, Yongfuxing, and Yongfeng rose to about 3 yuan. The morning opened flat. After the opening, large investors' selling interest was still strong, and buyers lacked activity, gradually moving downstream. Although the HSBC Bank posted rates were flat in the United Kingdom and the United States, it had no impact. Whether the large loan between China and the United Kingdom was political or economic, it was ultimately unfavorable to the bulls. In addition, there were only two days of trading in the November contract, so there were many spot sellers in the market, so although the silver equalization tax was flat, it was still trending downward. Later, large investors repeatedly maintained the price at the bottom, and the market began to hover. The market situation for the morning is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1152.9 yuan, the same as the previous closing price. Qiafeng Yong sold, but Dadesheng, Fuyu, Fuxing, and Yong were still buying in multiple trades. Later, when HSBC Bank posted rates were flat in the United Kingdom and the United States, Qiafeng, Yong, Dadesheng, Tianfaqing, Fa Yongtong, and Fudeng sold in unison, retreating to 1.8 yuan. Qiafeng Yong bought at the bottom, rising to 2.2 yuan. However, Dadesheng, Jinfeng, and Yong continued to sell and gradually decline. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged, and the price fell to 1.1 yuan. Chunyuan, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Yida, Shengyuan, and Yonglai rose to 1.8 yuan. Fuyu, Daheng, and Dadesheng sold again, retreating to 1.2 yuan. Shenkang, Qiafeng, Yongyuan, and Maoyong bought at the bottom, and the price rose again to 1151.8 yuan at the afternoon close. After the close, Chengdai and others sold slightly, and the market weakened slightly.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the central bank's standard gold price, was still posted at 1154 yuan, about 2 yuan more than the closing price. The month of registration was 1147 yuan, November was 1152 yuan, and the morning top-up price was 1147 yuan. The spot market was flat. Tianjin goods were priced at 13.75 yuan, the buying price of Hechi was 11.5 yuan, and the selling price of Hechi was 17 yuan. Shengyuan Yong sold 70 taels, and Tongfeng Heng sold more than 100 taels. It is predicted that the November contract will be rolled over to the December contract, and the bulls will pay about 2.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was limited. In summary, Qiafeng, Yongcheng, Datong, Hengwan, Xingfuxing, and Yongdadesheng, Shenkanghengyuding, Shengyuan, Yong, etc. were on the buying side, while Qingfa, Yongdaheng, Jinfeng, Yongda, Yongtong, Taichang, Chunyuan, Yongfuyu, and Tianfa, etc. were on the selling side.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the market to recover. The morning opened at 1152.9 yuan, the highest was 1152.9 yuan, the lowest was 1151.1 yuan, and the afternoon closed at 1151.8 yuan, with a fluctuation of 1.8 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 1.1 yuan. The total number of transactions in the morning was 2,499 bars.</p>
<p>The November lineup: the bulls are Qiafeng Yong with more than 1,400, Dachangxiang with less than 1,100, Yong with more than 800, Qingfayong and Hengchangyong each with more than 500, Fuda with five Changxiang each with more than 400, Wanxing Lifeng each with more than 300, Shenkang with more than 200, and Shunlida Shunbing Xingyishengyongxiang Fuyuhong Lidingkang each with more than 100. The shorts are Dadesheng with more than 1,300, Tongfengheng Chengda Jingfu each with more than 700, Daheng with more than 600, Qianchangxiang Shengyuan Yongyuan Chang Yongshun Mao each with more than 300, Run Changyu Dafengheng Futaiheng each with more than 200, and Chunyuan Yong and Jinfeng Yong each with more than 100. The margin is 7,715 bars, with a total of 32 long positions and 32 short positions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the short side Yongfeng released 7 bars on the public list, and today the long side Dachangxiang should receive 7 bars, with a closing price of 1147 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Confidence is Firm; Foreign Exchange Unchanged Yesterday <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was seen as flat, with stable processes. At the beginning of the morning, overseas telegrams reported that the London big strip was flat in the near and far months, the New York silver market was unchanged, and the Montevideo forward silver price was unchanged. The pound against the dollar shrank by 75, the dollar against the pound shrank by 90625, the pound against the franc fell by 9 points, and the dollar against the franc was small by 25. The central bank's posted rates were flat in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with selling prices for recent contracts, the pound at one shilling, two pence, and 4375, and the dollar at 29.5 yuan, which was flat compared to the previous close. After the opening, the banks were slightly congested, and the market was sluggish and slightly loose. The HSBC Bank posted rates were flat in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the silver equalization tax was unchanged. There were many foreign exchange transactions in the middle of the day, and the market hovered. Later, the banks were unevenly mixed, and the situation was vague. At the close, the selling price of the pound was one shilling, two pence, and 4375, and the dollar was 29.5 yuan, which was flat compared to the previous close. The forward exchange rates were also flat in the United Kingdom and the United States. Chinese merchants lacked activity, and banks were also mixed. However, foreign firms slightly pushed the dollar in the forward market. The day's transaction gold is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price of the pound was one shilling and 4375, and the Orient sold to Macgary October 4375 and Citibank Youli sold December 34375 (the exchange rate for the pound and the dollar was 4.89125 yuan). Great Britain sold to Huabi spot 46875, and the closing selling price for the spot was one shilling, two pence, and 4375, with 375 and 4375 for October, 375 for November, 3125 and 375 for December, and 3125 for January. The bid price was slightly higher.</p>
<p>The morning opening price of the dollar was 29.5 yuan. Macgary sold to foreign firms January-February 25, Macgary sold the same month 3125, Citibank Youli sold November 1225 (exchange rate for the pound and the dollar), Mitsui sold to Zhengjin November 375, Macgary ate the same month at the same price, Citibank sold to Great Britain December 3125, Shanghai sold January-February 3125, and Huabi sold January 1875. The closing selling price for the spot was 29.5 yuan, October 4375, November 375, December 3125, and January 0625. The bid price was 25.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Securities: Bond Market Weak and Sluggish Again; Bullish Sentiment Gradually Apparent; Market Price More Likely to Fall Than Rise <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange initially rose due to the British pound loan, but later weakened due to the strengthened situation. The market price seemed to be hovering, and the trend was showing signs of weakness. The loan between China and the United Kingdom was limited to goods. The chaos in eastern Sui had obviously come into contact, and the surface seemed to be a local problem, but in reality, it was related to the overall situation. In terms of type C bonds, it had never been benchmarked out at 60.05 yuan three times, and each time it turned small. The future may still return to the 60 yuan mark. The opening yesterday was entirely due to the news of the British pound loan. Buyers of No. 35 were particularly numerous, and the rest still sold at high prices, so although it rose by three or five cents, it did not seem strong. Sales of Nos. 11 and 14 were the most enthusiastic, and retail investors continued to buy in the second round. Nos. 4 and 6 sold quite a bit. Type E was slightly smaller, and the rest continued to do well by one or two cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment was already weak. It became known that the British pound loan was only for the supply of goods and did not benefit public bonds. The bulls of No. 35 turned to selling, and the selling of No. 32 was particularly enthusiastic. The market price unanimously turned down, small by five cents to one cent to two and a half cents. There were very few buyers at the close, and No. 14 continued to sell, again small by five cents to one cent to two cents. As a result, it still rose by one and a half cents to three and a half cents. The trend is that the short positions on the table have suffered losses, and those who short sell are becoming fewer and fewer, gradually forming a bullish sentiment, so the market price is more likely to fall than rise. The number of transactions totaled 6,535,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e207">Food: Flour Market Chaotic and Abnormal; Falling and Rising, Rising and Falling Again; Margin Requirement Increased to 500 Yuan Starting Today <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was chaotic and abnormal in the morning after the opening. Each month's market was falling and rising, rising and falling again, which was the old trick of extreme speculators. When the opening price was set, Chicago foreign wheat was reported to be down by 12 cents, and the early districts abroad had received timely rain, so after the opening price, each month fell by two to three cents compared to the previous day. At the beginning of the second round of trading, the spot month was still down by one cent, but for November, the speculative bulls came out again and raised the price high. Starting from January, it rose by four or five cents compared to the initial round, exceeding the closing price of the previous day. The situation in the third round was even more chaotic. The spot month was raised as high as 3.65 yuan, and November was also up to 60 cents, but for the distant months, the bulls took the opportunity to release the margin, and the market calmed down. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still tight at first, but later the buyers stopped and the large bulls released their positions one after another, causing the market to weaken and fall by three or four cents across the board. Looking at the current situation, if the foreign wheat market turns down, the market value has also reached its peak, and it should hover in place. In addition, the exchange will increase the margin requirement for both sides to 500 yuan starting this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Reasons for the Decline in Wheat Futures: Authorities Maintain People's Food Supply…Many Bulls, Domestic and Foreign, Emerge; Foreign Wheat Prices are Slightly Lower…The Result Also Returns Seven or Eight Cents <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market fell across the board in the morning because foreign wheat prices fell slightly, and it was rumored that the authorities had said that the high prices were affecting the people's food supply and that strict measures would be taken in the future, so the market calmed down at the opening, and the bulls inside and outside the industry released their positions one after another, and the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. Each month fell by three, six, and seven cents compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment had become harmonious, and transactions were very smooth in each month, and the market returned by one or two cents. In the future, if exports are banned, the hoarders will inevitably be fearful, and the market may stabilize from then on. The current wheat market, due to customers selling back, the price of extra high-quality wheat has increased by one cent, and the price of medium-quality wheat has stabilized. Shandong wheat opened at 5.75 yuan, Yingzhou wheat at 5.7 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 5.65 yuan, second-class 63 cents, Yaowan wheat at 5.6 yuan, second-class 58 cents, Shahe wheat at 5.62 yuan, Yancheng wheat at 5.53 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.75 yuan, Daorenqiao wheat at 5.3 yuan, second-class 25 cents, Guangshui wheat at 5.41 yuan, second-class 36 cents, and Zhumadian wheat at 5.55 yuan, Xianghe wheat at 5.2 yuan, and 5.1 yuan. Fuxin bought 3,000 bales, Fufeng bought 5,000 bales, and Shenda bought 2,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Replenishing Short Positions in Sesame is Quite Strong; Soybean Sales Turn Sluggish <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The recent sesame market needs to be observed in two ways: actual sales and offsetting short positions, so the trend is difficult to grasp for a while. Foreign companies' actual sales are not moving, and the market is only flat, but offsetting short positions is quite strong, and the source is not abundant, resulting in a lack of supply, so it still feels tight. Spot sales of raw sesame have Ningbo, Fuzhou, Shaoxing, and other places in this street purchasing thousands of bales of each variety of sesame. The market price is not much different from the previous market, and there may be a trend of rising greatly and falling back slightly in the future. Soybean sales have turned sluggish, and the demand from oil extraction plants has become stagnant. Yesterday, only 1,109 bales of Tancheng beans and 500 bales of Hankou vehicle beans were purchased. There were also fewer sales in Shantou, Fuzhou, this street, and other places. It is estimated that more than 1,200 bales of beans from all routes were traded, and the market price is temporarily high and stable, and the second-class is flat.</p>
<h3 id="e210">New Tinplate Greatly Lacking <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Among the tinplate circulating in the market, the most common are Union Iron, Narrow Strip Iron, and Tag Iron. As for new iron of the genuine grade, the entire city feels a great lack. Therefore, printing factories and canneries all feel there is no stock to purchase. Prices are therefore gradually rising, such as single-linked [tinplate] at eighteen yuan and fifty cents, and double-linked opening at thirty-seven yuan and fifty cents (the above are prices for English, German, and Italian goods). As for domestic goods, the market price must be increased by two to three yuan, such as single-linked opening at twenty yuan and seventy-five cents, and double-linked at forty yuan. However, buyers are actively seeking [goods] from abroad.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Ewo [洋行, foreign firms] sold four to five hundred barrels of zinc sheets, at a price of £18 5s per ton, an increase of 5 shillings compared to the previous price. It is reported that the latest overseas fixed price must be £18 17s, but due to the rapid price increase, many in the same industry are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<h3 id="e211">The Rise of Northern and Southern Merchants Competing for the Purchase of Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice arriving and being sold was both booming, with the market showing a firm stance. Subsequently, about 10,000 bags continued to arrive from various ports such as Xiangtan, Hankou, and Jiujiang. Although the Cantonese merchants had little appetite and Shantou was only clearing out inventory, with new transactions remaining hesitant, the demand from Northern ports suddenly surged. In addition to actively purchasing Hetao rice in the market, they also absorbed more than 3,000 bags of Xianggan machine-milled rice. The local appetite turned active. The Cantonese merchants also purchased more than 4,000 bags of Shashi and Hunan unpolished rice. Therefore, although the daily arrivals were robust, the market remained firm and brisk, with an estimated remaining stock of over 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Tianjin Merchants Continue to Purchase Thick Xin Geng Rice <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for various merchants still numbered about fifty, totaling over 10,000 piculs. Business at the local military ground was as usual. Fortunately, Tianjin merchants purchased nearly 1,000 bags of Thick Xin Geng rice, while merchants from Qingyan and other areas purchased 1,300 to 1,400 bags of Yaozhong rice, stabilizing the market. Daily prices remained unchanged. However, field rice, due to poor sales, dropped by one or two cents. Du Yang fried new rice and other varieties also did not see much fluctuation. Xin Yin Yuan Tong, thick and thin broken rice, slightly softened.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for various merchants at the river ports numbered about thirty-five or six. The market consumed various goods. Xin Geng rice and various pointed rice sold slightly better, while other goods remained sluggish. Market prices for high-quality Xin Geng rice were flat and weak, while medium and lower grades remained firm. Broken rice, Yang Du, port guest pointed rice prices remained stable. Yaozhong rice was scarce. Chen Bian Yuan high-quality goods remained firm, while medium and lower grades were slightly softer.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Silk and Tea: US and Japanese Prices Report Increases; Silk Transactions Revive in the Local Market <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market gradually showed signs of recovery. Silk prices in both New York and Yokohama reported increases, significantly brightening the recent sluggish atmosphere. New York saw near and far term prices each rise by one and a half cents, while Yokohama spot prices rose by 10.50 yen and futures by 7 yen. As a result, silk trading in Shanghai gradually showed signs of activity. The quoted price from the French company was still considered too low, differing by about 50 yuan compared to the Shanghai market. The American company's silk prices were 630 yuan for self-branded B-grade silk and 640 yuan for Yangfan silk. If the overseas silk market can continue to strengthen slightly, American sales should improve. People in the local silk market are also optimistic. However, due to the inability of Yokohama silk prices to remain firm in the afternoon, the market sentiment felt hesitant again. The total trading volume for the day was only a hundred or so bales, with market prices generally rising slightly by three to five yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The association's planned plates, including No. 24 coarse sand white and Dongbai, remained unchanged. However, spot No. 9 and Dongbai were called up by five cents to 21.15 yuan. The local factory's refined white sugar was still called at the original price. Numbered goods from Chaozhou opened at over a hundred bags of Hainan foreign sugar, with the higher price at 16.2 yuan, followed by 15.9 yuan. Refined raw sugar from Songfa Zhuang, 72 bags, at 15.8 yuan; Qilin brand, 90 bags, at 15.4 yuan; and Huanggang Qing, 72 bags, with better color and luster, opened at 14.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint venture company yesterday held its second tender for Cantonese sugar this week, with a total fixed amount of 8,600 bags. Tender prices remained the same, with limited transactions. 415 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep coarse white sugar were sold at 21.5 yuan; 40 bags from the Municipal New Factory at 21.3 yuan; 100 bags from Shantou Factory at 20.9 yuan; and 55 bags of medium sand white sugar at 19 yuan per bag.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Quanzhou telegram reported that the dried longan in the production area had become tighter recently due to the purchase by foreign merchants. The upper grade only rose by about one yuan due to a larger quantity of goods, the middle grade rose by two yuan, and the lower grade, due to scarcity, saw a higher increase of three yuan. The goods opened by the trade associations have been sold off at fire-sale prices. For the highest grade, the businesses may still be losing money. Yesterday, the market slightly improved due to the increased production price, with the highest grade also rising by one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Guo Ziyi Meets the Uyghur Alone on Horseback <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xi</p>
<p>During the early years of the Tang Dynasty in China, in the Yongtai period (1,172 years ago), in the ninth month, a traitorous general named Pugu Huai'en fabricated all sorts of lies and incited the Uyghur and Tubo, two foreign tribes, along with their accomplices from the Xiang and other tribes, totaling more than 300,000 people, to plunder in areas such as Jingzhou in our country. Their momentum was great, and they took the opportunity to directly attack Liquan and other places near the capital. The court was caught off guard and greatly shocked. Therefore, on one hand, they first took precautions, and on the other hand, they quickly called Guo Ziyi to gather troops in Jingyang to resist the enemy. However, Ziyi only had more than 10,000 soldiers at this time. Imagine using more than 10,000 soldiers to resist 300,000 soldiers; in reality, it was impossible. Furthermore, when Ziyi first arrived in Jingyang, he was already heavily surrounded by enemy soldiers. At this time, Ziyi's attitude was very calm, not panicked at all. He told all the generals to guard strictly and not to attack rashly. Coincidentally, at this critical moment, the traitorous general Pugu Huai'en died of a sudden illness, and the Uyghur and Tubo could not unite because of the struggle for power. Ziyi saw that the opportunity had arrived, so he immediately sent Li Guangxu as an envoy to meet the Uyghur.</p>
<p>Envoy Li took the order and ran straight to the enemy's Uyghur camp, met their leader—the chieftain, and said:</p>
<p>"I am sent by Guo Zhushi—to discuss with you, shall we join forces to fight the Tubo?"</p>
<p>The chieftain's face changed upon hearing this, and his attitude suddenly became awkward, as if he had developed a very heavy suspicion in his heart, but he still pretended to be calm and said:</p>
<p>"Is Duke Ling (the title by which Ziyi was respected by people at that time) really here? Are you really sent by Duke Ling? Hehe! Don't lie! Don't scare us with Duke Ling! If Duke Ling is really here, we must see him first to believe it."</p>
<p>Envoy Li listened to these words, then withdrew from the enemy camp and returned to his own camp to report in detail what he had said to the Uyghur chieftain.</p>
<p>Ziyi received the report and his courage increased a hundredfold, deciding to go alone to the enemy camp to meet the Uyghur commander. He immediately sent someone to arrange a meeting date with the enemy. At this time, his subordinates, both large and small generals, all came to dissuade him, saying:</p>
<p>"The Uyghur are barbarians, who do not value morality or understand integrity. You are a great general of the country, and your life is of utmost importance to the survival of the country. Be careful of your own body and do not risk going alone to meet them."</p>
<p>Ziyi said: "A person living in this world must value credibility and love the country. I have already made an agreement with the Uyghur, and I must abide by it; if the country is in distress, I must sacrifice myself to serve the country. Furthermore, if I don't go, it will only show that I, Guo Ziyi, am timid, weak, and incompetent. Now that such a large China is being oppressed by barbarians, who even dare to invade my country's vicinity with heavy troops, the most important thing at present is to promote the patriotic courage of us Chinese people. How can we show weakness? I am determined to go."</p>
<p>Seeing that Ziyi's determination to go was so firm that they could not stop him, the subordinates had no choice but to go with him and try to protect him. Unexpectedly, Ziyi stopped them again and said, "Let me go to see them alone. All of you cherish yourselves for the country, prepare for the worst, and avenge the country. Don't come with me." As soon as he finished speaking, he got on his horse, raised his whip, and galloped towards the Uyghur camp alone. The sentries along the road saw this situation and shouted to each other, "Duke Ling is here! Duke Ling is here!"</p>
<p>The Uyghur leader, Yaglu, received the news and was very surprised and suspicious. He led the leaders, big and small, prepared bows and arrows, and stood in front of the camp, waiting for Ziyi. After not much time, he saw that Ziyi had arrived. They put the arrows on the strings, ready to strike. Ziyi did not panic, approached the Uyghur camp, first took off his armor, put down his spears, and went straight in.</p>
<p>At this time, the Uyghur leaders, big and small, were shocked beyond measure, saying, "Duke Ling has really come." They immediately got off their horses, threw away their bows and arrows, and saluted Ziyi. Ziyi also got off his horse, greeted Yaglu, and said with a very gentle and solemn expression, "My China has always treated you extremely well, and you have always been extremely respectful to our country. Why did you only listen to Huai Ni's lies, lose the feelings between our two parties, and bring troops and horses deep into my country's vicinity, betraying China's consistent favor to you? Moreover, this Han traitor, Huai Ni, not only rebelled against the chaos, but even abandoned his old mother in order to rebel. What good is it for you to cooperate with such an unpatriotic and unfilial traitor? Now I am coming alone, because I value you and know that you can still listen. If you do not take these words to heart and even kill me, although I cannot resist again, my subordinates are not afraid of death, and they will definitely fight you to the death."</p>
<p>Yaglu listened to Ziyi's "righteous and stern" words and couldn't help but soften, saying, "Huai'en really deceived me. He said, 'The Khan (the foreign name for the Chinese emperor) has already passed away, and Duke Ling has already died.' I heard this lie, so I dared to come boldly. Now the situation is completely wrong. He is dead, and I have also understood. How dare we fight you again?"</p>
<p>Ziyi felt that the situation had become much smoother, knowing that the barbarians had always been ignorant of great righteousness and extremely greedy for small profits, and that the Uyghur were currently at odds with the Tubo, so he used the method of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to win him over, saying: "The Tubo's arrival this time is probably not for fighting, but for plundering property, right? If you don't believe me, think about how the livestock and horses they have plundered have been gathered together, and they are hundreds of miles long. This is clear evidence that they are determined to plunder. However, these many cattle, horses, and livestock are given to you by God. As long as we don't fight, listen to me and go to fight the Tubo together. After the victory, these many properties can be given to you. Think about it, is it worth it?"</p>
<p>Yaglu said: "We have already offended the superior country and Duke Ling by sending troops to the superior country after listening to the lies of the traitor Huai. Please forgive my sin! We will definitely help you." After the Uyghur finished speaking, they immediately took out wine and invited Duke Ling and all the association leaders to drink and pledge, and decided to do things according to the agreement, with no regrets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Tubo were still hesitant. Now that they heard that the two parties had already made an oath, knowing that their strength was too weak, they took advantage of the dark night and secretly fled, daring not to resist the superior country again.</p>
<p>When Duke Ling received this news, how could he let them go? He immediately arranged for the Uyghur troops to chase after them together. The captured and beheaded along the way were estimated to be more than 60,000 people. At the same time, he also tried to rescue the Chinese people who had been captured by them before. They were in a hurry to escape, so naturally they did not have time to move their property. Duke Ling took the property and sent it to the Uyghur as a reward. The Uyghur were grateful for the tolerance of the superior country, so they obediently withdrew their troops from China's territory.</p>
<p>From this battle, we can know how clever Ziyi's wit and how brave his courage were; and we can know that the encroachment of the barbarians is not terrible, as long as the whole country is united and studies methods to deal with them. What is terrible is only a sheet of loose sand, which is taken advantage of by the barbarians: By the time they are bullied, it is already too late to regret it. The Tang Dynasty praised him vigorously for this battle, and later generations praised him to the utmost. This is the story of "Guo Ziyi Meeting the Uyghur Alone on Horseback."</p>
<h3 id="e217">Faraday (Michael Faraday) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>— A Self-Taught Great Scientist —</p>
<p>Faraday was an English physicist and chemist. He invented inductive current, electrolysis laws, etc., and was a famous experimentalist in the scientific community. His origin was very humble. His achievements were entirely due to his hard work, perseverance, and constant learning, which enabled him to achieve complete success. The honor he received as a physicist and chemist was definitely not accidental.</p>
<p>Faraday was born in 1791. He was the third son of his father. His father was a blacksmith who could not work often due to his weak constitution, so the family was very poor. Faraday initially studied at a public school. At the age of thirteen, his father sent him to work in a bookstore, where he was assigned to be a newspaper delivery boy. After a year, he left the bookstore and became an apprentice in a bookbinding shop, with a term of seven years, graduating at the age of twenty-one. During these seven years of apprenticeship, whenever Faraday came across scientific books that he was binding, especially books on electricity, he would read and study them very carefully. Therefore, before long, he was making small glass bottles and tubes himself, and later he could even make electrical storage cylinders, although there were not many buyers. However, it was indeed an extremely difficult thing for a blacksmith's son to be able to make things and study electricity.</p>
<p>One day, Faraday heard that the scientist Mr. Tatum was giving a lecture on physics somewhere, held every seven days. The admission ticket cost twenty-five cents, which was too much for a bookbinding apprentice to afford. He went to discuss it with his brother Robert, who greatly supported his brother's aspirations and was willing to pay for the admission ticket each time. Faraday's first aspiration was successful because of his brother's help. At this time, a clerk skilled in drawing came to Faraday's shop, and he learned the technique of drawing unintentionally. Mr. Tatum's lectures were indeed well-deserved. Faraday also listened attentively and recorded everything the lecturer said, then transcribed it in regular script when he returned to the shop, eventually compiling it into four volumes, which he gave to his boss. Later, Faraday also heard the lectures of the chemist Sir Humphry Davy and was inspired to pursue chemistry.</p>
<p>In 1812, Faraday's bookbinding apprenticeship expired, and he wrote to Davy, saying that he was willing to learn chemistry from him, but Davy did not agree this time. Faraday could not get a mentor for the time being, so he self-studied Gatvanic. He initially used seven pieces of thin white lead, the size of half a copper coin, all plated with copper, and in the middle of each lead block, he used six layers of paper soaked in brine to protect it, to serve as a battery to electrolyze the essence of magnesium sulfate. Although Faraday did not gain much insight from trying to test profound electricity with such a shallow method, he himself had already felt the deep taste of chemistry.</p>
<p>Later, Faraday transferred to work in a bookbinding shop opened by a Frenchman. The shop owner was a reputable businessman in England. He had no children, and he discussed with Faraday that if he could work in the shop and never leave, he would give him the shop after his death. Faraday agreed, but the shop owner's temper was too bad, and Faraday was unwilling to be humiliated. Soon, he developed great ambitions.</p>
<p>One evening, Faraday suddenly received a letter from Davy, informing him that he would meet him in person tomorrow and had already agreed to find him a position in the academy. Faraday was overjoyed after reading the letter. The next morning, he went to the Royal Institution to visit Davy, who told him that he had found him a driver's position in the academy, with a salary of six yuan per week. The job was to clean the machines and deliver various supplies to the lecture stage during lectures, and there was nothing else to do. Faraday got this excellent job, so he resigned from the shop owner. From then on, he served in the Royal Institution, not only being able to hear valuable speeches often, but also being able to do various chemical experiments without spending money.</p>
<p>After entering the academy, Faraday decided on three principles for establishing himself: First, he believed that the academy was the place for him to settle down; second, he regarded books as good friends for further study; third, he strived to gain immortal fame. Based on these three principles, he succeeded in his great ambition.</p>
<p>Faraday experimented with various substances with Davy, experiencing many dangers. Initially, he invented the method of making sugar from turnips, and there was often a risk of explosion when combining dilute green gases. Several times, the glass mask covering his face was shattered, but fortunately, it did not damage his body. After seven months, Davy led him to visit France, Switzerland, Italy, and Mount Vesuvius. Whenever they encountered art academies and art schools, they would definitely go in to appreciate them. Faraday had both suffering and joy during the journey. The suffering was that he served Davy as a servant all the way, and he felt a lot of mental distress; the joy was that he, a young man who had never been outside the capital, was able to travel thousands of miles; and he was able to interact with famous scholars and writers of the time, which was truly the happiest thing in his life.</p>
<p>In the year that Faraday was twenty-four years old, he returned to England, at which time his annual salary had increased to 500 US dollars, and he was promoted to assistant instructor in the laboratory. When Davy was testing iodine gas and green gas, he also paid close attention. Davy created a safety lamp, which greatly benefited the workers in the mines, and Faraday's contribution was also not small. Faraday initially wrote six chapters of lectures, specifically discussing the affinity of matter and the method of defining and extracting homogeneity, which he presented publicly at the local natural history society, gaining much admiration from the audience. In the same year, he also wrote a chemical essay, detailing the viscosity of burning medicine (i.e., corrosive medicine). The following year, he wrote another six chapters of lectures, discussing coal gas and metal substances, and received much praise. After seven years, Faraday had graduated in chemistry. His writings totaled twenty-seven chapters, and there was also a book on the invention of steel alloys, as well as a chapter of lectures on two newly invented iodine-carbon mixtures, and the new quality of iodine-carbon light compounds that he had obtained from his experiments.</p>
<p>On June 12, 1812, Faraday married his lover Sarah Barnard. After marriage, he studied chemistry diligently and made more creations. After twenty years, his reputation had spread far and wide, and he was elected as a member of the Royal Society of England. He initially wrote twelve chapters of lectures on chemical refining techniques, followed by six chapters on chemical essence, and then six chapters on electromagnetism. In addition, he wrote books such as Elementary Knowledge, which he lectured on in various schools for as long as nineteen years. At the same time, five industrial societies in Woolwich hired him as the main lecturer, also for twenty years. Later, the government specially appointed him as an engineering consultant for the construction of lighthouses and the installation of buoys. When Faraday lectured, he often demonstrated in public to prove that what he said was true. Prince Albert also often led the Crown Prince to attend. Faraday wrote a total of one hundred and fifty-eight chemical treatises. Among them, the thirty chapters on electrical inventions were the best. Dr. Gladstone called these the masterpieces of England, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>Faraday's first discovery was that when extracting gasoline, he measured that the pressure of the gas could condense into a liquid. Following his father, he invented magnetically generated electricity and the method of conducting electricity through wires. Telegraphs and telephones originated from this.</p>
<p>After Faraday became famous, he was extremely filial to his mother, and he often remembered his deceased father, and he often said to people, "I like ironworkers very much, because they are very useful to the world, my father was also an ironworker, and I have never been ashamed of being the son of an ironworker." When Faraday was forty-nine years old, his mental strength suddenly declined. After his wife Sarah's advice, he went to Switzerland for treatment for four years before he was able to resume his normal experimental work.</p>
<p>Faraday worked in the laboratory, entering the academy every morning and going to bed at eleven o'clock in the evening. Except for meals every day, he never wasted a minute or a second of his precious time. When he got old and his body was truly weak, he stopped teaching. At that time, the whole world commemorated his achievements, and academic societies from all countries sent him medals and honored him as a director. French Emperor Napoleon III awarded him a responsibility. The Paris Exposition gave him the first prize medal, Queen Victoria specially hosted a banquet for him in the detached palace, and allowed her husband Prince Albert's request to specially award Faraday the first house of the government, which was truly glorious.</p>
<p>In the year that Faraday was seventy-one years old, his memory was almost completely lost; but he still executed all reports on lighthouses, motors, and steam engines himself.</p>
<p>On August 25, 1867, Faraday died in the chair of his study. His will was not to be buried in Westminster Abbey, mixed among the general dignitaries. He only wanted to be buried in Highgate Cemetery, and his will was not to erect a monument, but to insert a piece of white stone with the inscription of someone's tomb and the date of birth and death. Faraday was seventy-three years old when he died.</p>

<p>— Jie Fei</p>
<p>The cold light shines, China Publishing</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Qinnan's writings once gave me a deep impression, especially *La Dame aux Camélias*, *Fu Zhang Lu*, and *Jinghua Bixue Lu*. My ability to roughly understand writing and write some classical Chinese is not without the benefit of Mr. Lin's enlightenment. His works, along with Mr. Liang Rengong's unrestrained and progressive writings and thoughts, had the same cultivating value for me.</p>
<p>Of course, times are advancing, and Mr. Lin's thoughts and writings are somewhat outdated. Even with this book, very few people borrow it from the library, which is clear evidence. But although Mr. Lin has been forgotten by others, he has never been forgotten by me. - Perhaps this is a bit of my stubbornness! Soon, I will still be asking for his *Mo Xia Zhuan*? - But here I can at least offer two points about Mr. Lin: first, his personality - a kind of Chinese "scholar-gentleman" personality - he "was young and willful, and people regarded him as mad, extremely passionate." Mr. Lin was a Confucian scholar, but also a [fierce/spirited person] - this is similar to Mr. Zhang Taiyan. - He had utmost affection, such as his sympathy - not limited to helping people of his time - his patriotism, his concern for the world, and his constant "crowing at dawn" - as Mr. Lin described himself - are all extremely commendable. And today's scholars rarely see such examples. In today's turbulent national situation, I personally long to promote this kind of "scholar-gentleman" category. Mr. Lin's contribution to translation and his lifelong diligence and loyalty are worthy of our admiration. He translated more than 140 foreign books - including short stories, no less than 200 - and his achievements in poetry and painting are also commendable. Even today, his translations such as *Fu Zhang Lu* and *Saxon Heroes* are still used as supplementary reading materials for middle school Chinese language classes, and no less than seven or eight types are included in the Wan You Wen Ku, and their influence, though changed, has not diminished.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that since Mr. Lin passed away in 1923, in the past ten years, besides Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's article "Mr. Lin Qinnan" in *Fiction Monthly* and this book, there are almost no other memorial articles to be seen. The reason for this is that the old criticize his writing as being neither elegant nor completely colloquial - as Mr. Zhang Taiyan said - and that his writing conveyed morality but was irrelevant to new ideas - as Mr. Liang Rengong said - while the new blame him for translating second- and third-rate works and often losing the original meaning. Therefore, he is not appreciated by either side. It is sad that Mr. Lin's contributions have been obscured and not recognized!</p>
<p>This book's discussion is particularly fair and can trace Mr. Lin's intentions and actions, which is commendable. It is the only accurate record of Mr. Lin's life, ensuring that Mr. Lin's actions, conduct and writings will not be buried and forgotten, which is also commendable. However, I cannot help but comment: first, the structure of this book is too incomplete. Its table of contents is: 1. Brief Biography; 2. Thoughts and Enthusiasm; 3. Literary Criticism; 4. Translation; 5. Creation; 6. Literary Value and Achievements; 7. Conclusion. Listing literary criticism third is inappropriate in terms of sequence; also, the conclusion can be omitted. Second, this book is hastily written and its content is rather messy. For example, in the chapter on the brief biography, since the preface expresses dissatisfaction with Mr. Chen Yan's biography, then a complete and coherent biography should be written instead of just piecing together trivial remarks unrelated to his experience, which is negligent. Mr. Lin passed away only ten years ago, and his life and conduct are widely recorded in writings and oral accounts, which should be recorded and preserved to serve as material for understanding a person and discussing the world. Also, in the chapter on translation, many [blanks/dashes] are used in place of translated books. Since it is mentioned that *Fiction Monthly* has records, and *Fiction Monthly* is not a difficult book to obtain, it should be checked and written in to seek perfection. As for the conclusion, it is even more disjointed. There are also many repetitions and debatable arguments throughout, such as the claim that Mr. Lin's poetry was extremely successful, which I personally at least cannot agree with. - There are many such instances. Although it is not a hasty work - the author's preface was written ten years ago - it has many omissions and flaws.</p>
<p>I briefly record what I have seen, hoping that the author will make corrections and additions, collect more of his surviving works, and append a chronological biography to make it a perfect work. This is my wish.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Doubting Antiquity School and the Social History School <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Fu</p>
<p>In recent years, a very gratifying phenomenon in Chinese academia has been the willingness to put in substantial research into ancient history and to make substantial efforts to organize ancient academic thought. One school doubts antiquity, and the other is the school of social historians. Although their positions are different, they are unwilling to blindly believe in ancient history and ancient books. Instead, they re-evaluate them, use scientific and empirical methods to sweep away all previous outdated views, in order to open up a new path. This is completely the same.</p>
<p>The school of doubting antiquity can be traced back to Mr. Qian Xuantong, which can be seen from his personal abolition of his surname and his self-proclaimed name "Doubting Antiquity Xuantoong". He is immersed in hard work, and the most successful in recent times is Mr. Gu Jiegang.</p>
<p>In Beijing, there are organizations such as the Yu Gong Society and the Archeology Society. Their spirit and reality are worthy of infinite admiration.</p>
<p>The leader of the social history school is Mr. Guo Moruo, whose book "Research on Chinese Ancient Social History" is a famous masterpiece. Later, such as the *Reading Magazine* school, although their opinions differ from Mr. Guo's, they can also be classified into this category. And Tao Xisheng's founding of *Shi Huo* and his earnest efforts to organize work also reflect the excellent research spirit of social historians.</p>
<p>Regardless of Gu Jiegang's doubting antiquity school or Guo Moruo's social history school, both schools undoubtedly represent the progressive research spirit of Chinese scholars. They stand on a common front to overthrow the old learning, which is inevitably a necessary trend from all perspectives.</p>
<p>The doubting antiquity school shakes the halls of old national studies by determining the dates of the already completed classics and ancient books by the author; the social history school conducts various studies on Chinese culture, trying to emphasize the overthrow of unfounded speculations.</p>
<p>However, although these two schools are regarded as standing on the same front, their different beliefs and research methods often cause conflicts and resistance.</p>
<p>The former is a collection of scholars of old learning, while the latter has been nurtured by the emerging social sciences. At the same time, the social history school has repeatedly engaged in heated debates due to their different positions, while the doubting antiquity school is simply immersed in work. Although it is said that there are also differences of opinion and mutual disputes, they do not have theoretical goals, but rely on their own academic achievements, which is where the two differ.</p>
<p>Of course, scholarship flourishes through discussion. Because the two schools have different positions, there are often conflicts. The recent thesis by Mr. Ju is a manifestation of the doubting antiquity school attacking the social history school. Its title is "On the Origin of the Abdication Legend from the Mohist School," published in the first issue of the *Historical Studies Collection of the National Peking Research Institute*.</p>
<p>The so-called abdication, needless to say, refers to the story of Yao passing the throne to Shun, and Shun passing the throne to Yu, without passing it on to their sons, but rather to virtuous men. This is common knowledge for those who read Confucian books. Why has it become a major issue recently?</p>
<p>First, it is believed that the legend of Yao and Shun abdicating the throne, which is the most magnificent story in Confucianism, was entirely created by the Mohist school, which opposed Confucianism.</p>
<p>Second, Guo Moruo argued in "Research on Ancient Society" that the abdication of Tang and Yu was merely a misunderstanding of the clan chief election system during the matriarchal system.</p>
<p>Both of the above offer new criticisms of national studies and provide special insights, attempting to overthrow the empty and exaggerated legends of the past, which is the same goal. Gu's words are natural for criticizing old national studies, and there is no problem; but criticizing Guo's theory contains extremely complex problems.</p>
<p>Guo's "Research on Ancient Society" was a work from the era when the social history school emerged, so it is often the focus of criticism by later scholars. For example, even those belonging to the social history school were opposed by colleagues from *Reading Magazine* two years ago. Regarding issues such as matriarchal society and the marriage system, corrections to Guo's theory have continued to emerge from ancient historians in China and Japan, and Guo himself has also revised several points.</p>
<p>However, Gu's attack is not limited to Guo Moruo personally; it can be said to be directed at the entire social history school.</p>
<p>Originally, is the abdication legend a historical material passed down from an ancient social system? Gu believes that this is the Mohist school's advocacy of virtuousness, that is, a cultural work promoting egalitarianism. It originated from the Confucian school, was distorted by the Legalist school, and transformed by the Taoist school. He completely rejects treating this legend as historical material for ancient history. His arguments that the abdication legend originated from the Mohist school are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>In an era when the hereditary system existed rigidly, the fact that the emperor abdicated the throne to a commoner could not have occurred. In this era, as expressed in poems, books, or inscriptions on bronzes, there are mostly praises of the hereditary system. However, by the time of Confucius, the collapse of the hereditary system had already begun. Confucius himself was in a transitional era, troubled by the contradiction between the old system and new trends. Mencius' opposition to hereditary officials and Xunzi's and Gongyang Zhuan's opposition to hereditary succession are even more explicit. This opposition to the hereditary system became the fuse for the advocacy of virtuousness by the Mohist school. They regarded fishermen, cooks, and commoners as having the same abilities, and referred to high officials and emperors with the same titles. The Mohist school's ideal was a group that elected a leader to implement a democratic policy, and those who jointly advocated the abdication theory wanted to implement it within their own group. Once the Mohist theory became popular, the monarchs of the Warring States period also showed signs of wanting to implement abdication themselves. Mencius and Xunzi, both Confucian scholars, also adopted the Mohist school's advocacy of virtuousness. However, the abdication theory, which shook the position of the monarch, was still distorted and denied by the general public. For example, the Legalist school rejected Yao and Shun, who practiced abdication, as being contrary to the [relationship/principle] between ruler and minister; while the Taoist school extremely worshiped uncivilized people who did not accept abdication and despised Yao and Shun. Only in the Han Dynasty, when official learning was unified, did this abdication theory become a historical fact recorded in the *Yao Dian*, written by the gentle and orthodox Han people.

<h3 id="e220">Starting with Women's Longer Lifespan and Men's Shorter Lifespan <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ci</p>
<p>According to a recent study by Mr. Austin, Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, statistical methods prove that women live longer than men. He said that the average life expectancy of white women in the United States is 63 years, while the average life expectancy of men is 59 years. Mr. Austin's research is said to be based on the census statistics compiled in 1930. Whether this statistical method is accurate is naturally still a question, but assuming it is reliable, it would be more than 10 years longer than the average life expectancy of Americans surveyed in 1900 - 51 years for women and 48 years for men.</p>
<p>China's population still does not have accurate statistics, so the average life expectancy of men and women is naturally "out of the question." However, it can be speculated that it is unlikely to be longer than that of Americans. Years of natural disasters and man-made calamities, social exhaustion, and the difficulty of making a living often grind a strong "hero" into a thin and dying "sick man." In such circumstances, how can they not "die halfway"? Even relatively fortunate people are mostly licentious, indulging in wine and women, and living an unregulated life, which also self-destructs their natural lifespan.</p>
<p>This is just speaking generally. As for the lifespan between men and women, although no one has statistically analyzed it yet, it is the same as in the United States: women live longer than men. Why? Apart from the physiological differences between men and women, there are also great differences in the social environment they are exposed to. Just physiologically speaking, women over 50 seem to have less intense sexual desires, while men, even at 70 or 80, still want to take concubines. Although the reason for "taking a concubine" is to carry on the family line, if sexual desire is put aside, how will this "line" be carried on? Speaking of human affairs, China has always been a male-centered society. Although it is said that women's rights are high now, men still account for the absolute majority of the "pillars of society." Even within the family, women are in a subordinate position. Mental wear and tear and physical exertion are naturally greater for men than for women. Being able to live to 50 or 60 is already considered a long life, while it is not uncommon for women to live to 70 or 80. In the western suburbs of Shanghai, there is a [club/organization] called something, which held a weaving competition the other day. The first prize winner was a person called "Gai Meimei." Although the name sounds like a 16-year-old girl, she is already 80 years old.</p>
<p>Judging from this situation, the stronger the feudal forces, the greater the age difference between men and women. Although the United States is an advanced and civilized country, women's status is ultimately inferior to that of men, so women's average life expectancy is four years longer than that of men. In China, this number is roughly more than ten years. In a male-centered society, the lifespan of men is so short, which is really not a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>But the problem is not the difference between men and women, but how to increase the average age of human beings.</p>
<p>People always have a desire to survive. The methods of health preservation lie in using all human wisdom to fight against nature. The most important thing is the progress of medicine and the improvement of living standards. With advanced medicine, diseases that shorten human life will have no way to run rampant, and raising the standard of living will further eliminate the occurrence of diseases as much as possible. But although humans have such wisdom, the inferior nature of killing each other can never be eradicated. So on the one hand, there are facilities to protect health, and on the other hand, there are weapons to manufacture mutual killing. If mankind is to be destroyed, the road to destruction is one we walk ourselves!</p>
<h3 id="e221">Heng Xu <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lu</p>
<p>It's morning. The city is awakened by a few workers and vendors at the early market, and the stupid fellows sweeping the streets.</p>
<p>Now it's a little past 5 a.m. In the early autumn of the South, at this time, the sky already has a white, misty silver light, shining on the newly laid black asphalt road. Two or three rickshaw pullers on the "night shift," dozing off, use their two powerful arms to press on the rickshaw pole with no urgency, dragging their weary steps forward. From time to time, two or three cars pass swiftly and silently, startling them from their feigned sleep. They immediately remember to hurry to "Xiti" to pick up the early ferry. Therefore, they sing "Half a chicken, a pot of Yong Liwei..." and pull the rickshaws south.</p>
<p>At this time, a group of "buyers" of old goods, each carrying a full load of old goods on a shoulder pole, turn a corner from the new road of "Xia Jiupu" and walk west. They walk very neatly and quietly, as if afraid of disturbing anyone in the early morning.</p>
<p>They don't walk far before they encounter several "fellows." When they meet acquaintances, they greet each other as usual:</p>
<p>"Good morning! Good business?"</p>
<p>"Good morning," they answer politely, and then it's the usual line that has become common in recent years: "Not good! Business is more difficult these past few years than before!"</p>
<p>This kind of life is already customary for them. At most every other day, they have to rush to "Heng Xu" early in the morning to sell off the goods they've collected, otherwise the capital will be tied up and they won't be able to turn around. Then even selling the ancestral fields won't be enough to cover the losses.</p>
<p>Heng Xu is their designated meeting place. Every day, before it's fully light, they do buying and selling business, and then disperse when it gets light. This is a very strange custom, very much like the true saying that "old goods can't see the light." Therefore, the history of this Heng Xu can be considered quite old in this city. Although it has been banned several times, it's nothing more than changing locations and starting over.</p>
<p>The current location is in front of a dark [temple/shrine] at "Xilai Chudi."</p>
<p>The lights are still on, and heads are surging under the ghostly lights. The sounds of bargaining are replaced by fingers and abacus beads. The scene is like a clandestine secret business. A new team of "fellows" joins in, and the situation becomes lively. The waving of hands also increases in power. Buyers and sellers are very skilled in speaking many of the terms of the trade. This one is haggling to "squeeze up!" The other side, the "customer," is unwilling to pay, and only offers one! "Three seven qian and two!" Although the price difference is too great, neither side is willing to give in, not even half a "dou ling."...</p>
<p>"Country bumpkin, don't be so stubborn, sell it and you'll lighten your shoulders, saving yourself the trouble of carrying it back and forth."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Those who know the goods buy the goods. This is not like selling antiques at "Shuangmen Di," the prices are honest, how can the difference be so great!"</p>
<p>"Alright, alright! I'll add you two fen and four, sell it or don't, it's up to you!"</p>
<p>"Business depends on repeat customers! Good, good, good!"</p>
<p>Thus, another item changes hands in the dark.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also people arguing here. Like some "outsiders" who come to Heng Xu for the first time, they are unfamiliar with the trade and don't know what's going on. "The boat's head is panicked by ghosts, the boat's tail is panicked by thieves!" They want to be greedy for cheap, but they are also afraid of being tricked. So, you say one thing, I say another, and everyone starts shouting and cursing.</p>
<p>The sky is slowly being dyed half red. The light of the lamps loses its flame under the sunlight, and Heng Xu also appears desolate. The crowded people all disperse at once. When dawn returns, the square returns to silence. The ground is littered with remnants, and another morning begins to arrive in the human world.</p>
<p>In people's memory, Heng Xu occupies a very small place. If you are from a [wealthy/urban] family, even if you are an old Guangzhou person, you may not know about it.</p>
<p>(Note) Xidi, Xia Jiupu, Xilai Chudi, and Shuangmen Di are all place names. "Zha zhu" means five, referring to "five yuan" here. Qi Qian Er is "one yuan". "Dou Ling" is half a jiao (cent). "Er fen si" is "three fen" one jiao (cent). "Selling antiques at Shuangmen Di" is a common saying, meaning "asking for a high price."</p>

<p>— Lan Pei</p>
<p>——Record of a Village Trip.</p>
<p>"Are there bandits everywhere in Tangshan?"</p>
<p>My cousin curiously asked me for some news about China. Her family and the friends around her had never mentioned China to her. Occasionally, she could see a small piece of information about China in the Malay newspapers, which vaguely made her realize that China was indeed a barbaric place filled with bandits.</p>
<p>"No--it's a good place! Bandits, that's just something in the deep mountains. Aren't there bandits in Kalihyu (a place name in Malaysia)? In short, Tangshan is not as scary a place as you know it. If you've ever been there, you'll be infinitely amazed! Maybe you won't want to come back, like me. Haven't I only returned once in three years?" I tried my best to explain.</p>
<p>My cousin didn't believe it, and smiled slyly: "Tangshan, the land of sweet potatoes (Note 1)!"</p>
<p>"Sweet potatoes may not be a good thing to eat. However, there are also Western-style houses in Tangshan, even more magnificent than those here. Haven't you seen photos? Then you must have seen movies, that's Tangshan!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right," my cousin laughed loudly. "That's Shanghai. Do you think I don't know that!"</p>
<p>I was almost a little annoyed. I hadn't expected that my cousin would be so unfamiliar with her motherland. Not understanding the situation of the motherland is understandable, but not even recognizing the most important places in the motherland is simply too unreasonable. "Overseas Chinese students, Dutch education!" I scolded in Chinese, indignantly.</p>
<p>"Shanghai is Tangshan! Have you read world geography? There's a page in there that says this. Shanghai, one of the world's largest cities, the economic and cultural center of China. -- Also, Guangzhou, you know that, right? Beijing, Tianjin, are all better than here, cars--whatever you say, everything is available. There's just one thing, there aren't people wearing "sarongs" like you."</p>
<p>"Maybe Shanghai is Tangshan, but--"</p>
<p>My cousin laughed again, as if this was an interesting thing.</p>
<p>"No way," I said to myself. "Like this, what can be done. She simply doesn't recognize herself as Chinese anymore. They, those thousands upon thousands of overseas Chinese students who are educated by the Dutch." I couldn't help but shout loudly: "No way, you can't look down on Tangshan like that, you're still Chinese after all--can you say you're Dutch?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't say I was Dutch--I'll still ask you nicely: Cousin, didn't you say that Shanghai is Tangshan? So: is Shanghai really like in the movies?"</p>
<p>"Uh--of course; hey, I didn't say that Shanghai is Tangshan, that's really like that--that's really funny! For you to say that."</p>
<p>I began to feel the power of the Dutch enslaving education system.</p>
<p>"People who are strangers to their motherland!"</p>
<p>I said quietly, indignantly.</p>
<p>Note: "People who eat sweet potatoes" is an idiom, meaning clumsy.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Signing <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Chuan</p>
<p>—Life Record—</p>
<p>The urgent shaking of the bobbins and the loud roaring of the machines in the workshop could not prevent her thoughts. While watching the yarn transfer from the small bobbin to the large one, followed by a thread breakage, she was planning for Xing's future. When she thought of sweet moments, her heart smiled.</p>
<p>Although she would still be unable to leave the factory life, unable to avoid standing in front of the machines for twelve hours every day, breathing in dust and cotton fibers, perhaps, the "foreman" of another factory would not be as hateful as the current one. Perhaps, the wages at another factory would be a little higher. These things didn't need to be worried about for now. As long as she wasn't sold by her heartless mother to a forty-eight-year-old tycoon as a concubine, she would be happy enough.</p>
<p>She wanted to live with him—her lover—in a small room in Yangshupu. Both of them would work at the same time and eat at the same table. No one would scold her, no one would take all of her wages, preventing her from buying even a slightly nicer dress.</p>
<p>In her sweet fantasies, time flew by quickly. In the blink of an eye, the red light turned on, and the workers turned off their machines and rushed to the dining hall together. When she came back, she found the "Number One," and told her that she wanted to sign out. The "Number One" was a very kind old woman, and she agreed to her request without asking any questions, and even offered to find the foreman to sign for her.</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the morning, she bid farewell to her little sisters in the workshop, especially saying a few words of gratitude to the "Number One." With the paper signed by the foreman in her pocket, she brushed off the cotton fibers on her head and clothes, and stepped into the personnel department.</p>
<p>She only glanced at the red-faced section chief, then quickly lowered her head and said softly,</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm signing out." At the same time, she handed the paper signed by the foreman to him.</p>
<p>"Quitting to work at another factory?" The voice sounded like it was bursting out of a tightly closed bottle.</p>
<p>"No!" she quickly said, glancing at him again.</p>
<p>His hands were flipping through a thick book, but his eagle-like eyes were glancing at her sideways. His two blood-red, thick lips were crooked, and he softened his voice a little:</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>"I'm not doing it anymore," she said softly.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Not doing it anymore? You're not allowed to sign out." His voice became rough again, and he lowered his head, focusing on the book.</p>
<p>Her face turned red. She wanted to argue with him that quitting was her freedom, but she immediately softened, thinking that doing so would not end well, and her wages would definitely be confiscated. She had to lower her voice and say gently,</p>
<p>"Sir, I want to..." She couldn't go on, she couldn't bring herself to say it.</p>
<p>"What? Getting married?"</p>
<p>She had to nod.</p>
<p>"Marrying who?" The section chief propped his hands on the table, leaning on one shoulder, and asked.</p>
<p>"What does it matter to you who I marry?" she couldn't help thinking. But for the sake of the money, she had to endure and answer.</p>
<p>The section chief urged her again, and she had to answer:</p>
<p>"Zhou Zhiying."</p>
<p>"Hmph, is that the yarn weigher in the fine yarn workshop? You're having an affair, you're not allowed to sign out!"</p>
<p>She almost cried. She wanted to grab him and slap him hard a few times, but she endured it. However, her tone already carried resentment.</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm signing out, give me my wages!"</p>
<p>The section chief's eyes were back on the book, and he said fiercely:</p>
<p>"Go back, call someone from your family to prove it, if you lie, your wages will be confiscated! Get out now!"</p>
<p>Every muscle in her body was twitching. She bit her lip, glared at him with all her might, took the gate pass he had written, and stormed out of the room in anger.</p>
<p>At the factory gate, Zhou Zhiying was waiting for her. Seeing her mournful face, he was stunned and dropped his smile.</p>
<p>"He won't let me sign out, what do you think we should do? Adding our wages together, I could get twelve yuan, now... now..." She cried.</p>
<p>The other's response was a long sigh of disappointment.</p>

<p>"What about you?" she asked him, holding back her tears.</p>
<p>"I signed out and got thirteen yuan."</p>
<p>"Why did he let you sign out?"</p>
<p>"If I didn't sign out myself, he would have fired me anyway. Don't you see that the yarn weighers in other workshops have all been replaced with female workers?"</p>
<p>The two of them involuntarily turned their eyes to the tall red factory building, casting one last angry look at the factory that had bound them for five years.</p>

<p>The Crime</p>
<p>"Yes, since you are a human, you should live on, but what if you can't live on..."</p>
<p>Yu Shouguang is someone who wants to live on but can't. He has no food to eat, no place to live, so he has no way to live on. He thinks of committing suicide... However, he also feels afraid of death, and he has to think of a comfortable way to die. So he stole the felt from the inn to pawn for one yuan and two mao, and he decided to go to the pharmacy to buy "Over-the-Mountain Cyanide"—a kind of poison—to commit suicide. However, the snobbish pharmacy owner saw his ragged appearance and suspected that he was buying it to kill someone, so he wouldn't sell it to him.</p>
<p>Yu Shouguang, who couldn't even get the freedom to seek death, was extremely angry. He had a conflict with the pharmacy owner and broke the store's glass cabinet. He was taken to the police station to be convicted.</p>
<p>The law is also a tool for the rulers to be accomplices. What crime do you think they will convict him of?</p>

<p>Opening "New Oriole Worships the Moon"</p>
<p>The jade sky is dust-free, with a round moon. Hong Niang invites the young lady to the east building. Lightly moving lotus steps down the high building, seeing the flowers and moonlight evenly divided. Flowers have a clear fragrance and the moon has shade. Miss, the moon is bright, no need for flower lanterns, the lanterns pale in comparison to the moon. Hong Niang, looking at flowers under the moon brings wealth and honor, appreciating the moon before flowers brings good spirits. Flower souls invite moon spirits, moon spirits charm flower souls. Flowers fill the spring garden, the moon fills the forest. They, step through flowers under the moon, already arrived at the flower and moon forest's four-sided hall. Hong Niang is, the incense table arranged under the flowers and moon. I hope that the flower god and moon sister will feel my sincerity. Miss is, the first stick of incense inserted in the burner, bowing and kneeling on the cushion. Swallows and orioles sing a pious prayer, hoping the gods will hear my plea. Alas, my father passed away from illness and returned to the spring road, I have not yet fulfilled my filial duty. The second stick of incense inserted with both hands, may it protect my mother's longevity and fortune, may she be as evergreen as the pine and cypress of Nanshan. Miss is, kowtowing deeply, pondering again. The third stick of incense burned with tears, only there is no place to voice ten thousand idle sorrows, a belly full of grievances cannot be expressed. Therefore, silently expressing sincerity. Resenting only, my father's confused words during his illness, saying that he wants to marry into the Zheng family, relatives of the maternal side. The two families are originally one family. I am ashamed to tell my mother, hoping the gods will show my white-haired parent in a dream. Miss is, silently telling the things in her heart, who knows she has leaked two or three points. Spring scenery is always annoying.</p>
<p>Chen Lianqing and Qi Lianfang's Small Coin</p>
<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber: Qin Keqing"</p>
<p>The beautiful flower branch Qin Keqing, has a soft nature unparalleled in the world. She is, from a poor Qin family girl, marrying into a noble family like a deep sea. Glad only, her husband Jin Gui is somewhat comforting. Resenting only, her delicate body is often ill and groaning. But seeing her, knowing and befriending Wang Xifeng, extraordinarily pitiful to Shi Taijun. She is, ranked as a Golden Hairpin as an adopted daughter, causing her, flower face to wither, pitifully. Rong Ge'er, only knows to steal jade and incense, ignoring Jin Min's body illness. Once remembered, the brocade tent confuses the dream, the phantom land teases Shen Ying. To this day, the case is difficult to recognize, feeling that the first crime should be blamed on Hua Xiren. Unexpectedly, the fragrant soul easily breaks, how can one bear the jade breaking and the pearl sinking. Wang Xifeng, meets in a dream and startles from a dream, cloud board conveys the news to the whole house. Most painfully, the family of gods is too hasty, returning to Penglai is the cause of the past. I am, writing this opening as a subtle expression.</p>

<p>Ice and snow. Morning and night. The east wind moves. Spring is here. Flowers blossom everywhere, layer upon layer. Mornings reflect the clouds and rosy light. Nights accompany the gentle breeze and bright moon. Attracting swallows and orioles, startling bees and butterflies. Enticing lovers' joy, provoking laborers' farewell. Just a fleeting flowery world. Take advantage and don't worry about the rich buying and the poor owing.</p>
<p>Everyone loves. Fresh flowers and tender leaves. Especially those brothers and sisters. Even those younger brothers and sisters. Even those older grandmothers and grandfathers. Bamboo huts outside the forest. Tall buildings and long streets in the metropolis. Who can divide the rich and poor. Who can discern the elegant and vulgar. Some people fear spring's old age and flying flowers. Some worry about autumn's withered and fallen leaves. Red flowers bloom and white flowers fade continuously throughout the year. No time to manage so many things.</p>

<p>After re-screening "Aquatic Rhapsody" for two days, the Nanjing Grand Theater will continue to screen MGM's blockbuster "Madame". The film stars the runaway bride Barbara Stanwyck and the handsome British envoy Robert Taylor. The film tells the story of a love triangle between a pair of brothers and a woman. Robert Taylor has been enthusiastically loved by hundreds of millions of viewers since starring in "Broadway Melody of 1936", and is considered a goddess by women. For "Madame," the company originally intended to have Qin Hen Haruo as the female lead, but after learning that Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were very close, they appointed Barbara Stanwyck as the female lead, so that the audience could see the more realistic love scenes on the screen. The film is directed by Van Dyke, the director of "San Francisco," whose masterful skills add a lot of color to the film.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Guotai Screens "Girl's Dormitory" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>When Shown at the Los Angeles Theater in the United States, Audiences Reached 150,000 in One Week</p>
<p>The latest production of 20th Century Fox, "Girl's Dormitory", is scheduled to be shown at the Guotai Grand Theater starting today (Thursday). The story of the film tells about a girls' school with strict rules on the Alps. Many daughters of the upper class in Europe are sent to study here, but food and sex are human nature. These young girls are just beginning to feel love and are eager to have something to rely on, so the living trick of teacher-student love occurs. The plot is tortuous and bizarre, and the performance describes the girls' passionate emotions. It can be said to be meticulous. The main characters are Herbert Marshall, Ruth Chatterton, and the newly discovered French beauty star Simone Simon. It is worth mentioning that Simone Simon's acting skills, although this is her first work in Hollywood, have already made her one of the first-class stars in the United States. No one in the country does not praise her. It is heard that when the film premiered at the Los Angeles Theater in the United States, the audience reached 150,000 in one week. We can imagine the grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>"New Humanity" will start filming soon, and director Chu Wancang will lead the photography team to Xuzhou and Qingjiangpu to capture location shots.</p>
<p>Li Keng's younger brother, Li Xi, who was born not long ago, once appeared in "Life". Recently, he will show his skills again in "New Humanity", playing the role of the young son. In the silent "New Humanity", Li Keng originally played this role alone, and became famous in one fell swoop. This time, Li Xi and Li Keng will play the role separately, which may create a new child star for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Ms. Lin Chuchu has fully recovered after giving birth and will soon appear in "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit".</p>
<p>Xiao Ying plays the main character in "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit". In the first half of the film, he plays a dim-witted alcoholic gambler, and in the second half, he transforms into a serious, kind, and self-sacrificing figure. He will set a new record in Chinese actors' acting skills.</p>
<p>Ge Youzhi and Li Keng will have extremely important performances in "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit", and are currently practicing carefully.</p>
<p>Shi Shipan is in charge of photography for "New Humanity".</p>
