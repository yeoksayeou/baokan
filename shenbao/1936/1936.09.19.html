<h3>舊鈔整理問題</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>法幣制度推行以來。發行準備全已集中。各銀行所發之鈔票。可不必再有區域之限制。一體流通。便利孰甚。然因此市面流通之鈔票。種類形式愈趨複雜。常有較小商家。對於外埠地名之鈔票。以素少經見。眞贋難辨。恐受無妄之損失。拒絕使用。似此情形。實有不容忽視者。爰就舊鈔整理問題。觀感所及。略述數言。</p>
<p>（一）外埠鈔票。流行市土。發行銀行似宜通知兌換業一律照。兌母得拒絕。卽或有特殊情形。不能不有所限制。亦應就其來源。預事防杜。至現在所發行之鈔票。顏色花紋往往多所變換。足使用者認識小淸。偽票史易矇混。竊以為收回舊鈔換發新票。為便於辨認。雖亦不妨變更紋澤。但平時增發之新鈔。凡同等値者。總以不常變更形式為宜。</p>
<p>（二）我國發鈔。向極散漫。今發行旣已集中。則停北發行之各行舊鈔。殊應從速收回。據聞十個月以來。業已收回三分之二。市上流通者僅剩七千三四百萬元。故如浙江興業銀行等票市上已屬尠見。至通商四明中國實業各行鈔票。則仍觸目皆是。深望於短時期。內亦能全數收回。俾流行鈔票得歸整一。</p>
<p>（三）破舊鈔票之使用。銀行定有限制。而大多數民衆懵然未曉。以是居間者得以上下其手。行用者諸感不便。此種破舊鈔票固應由發鈔銀行不拘票面大小。隨時收兌。而於回籠鈔票。更當詳加檢視。剔除破舊。再將破舊鈔票使用之辦法。常以明顯之地位。刊載於各報。俾大衆知所抉擇。</p>
<p>（四）各行鈔票。多製自外國。而以美國為最多。平均計算。五元十元之鈔票。每張的需印刷費國幣七角。一元鈔票的需二角餘。角票每張亦需四分以。上自法幣推行。全用鈔票。需要愈增。卽此一筆印刷費用。常年外洩。數亦可觀。近聞財政當局籌備國內自行印製鈔票。此實切要之舉。深望其早獲實現。</p>
<p>（五）票面愈小之鈔票。需要愈多。流通愈頻。而殘破愈易。一元鈔票之印費旣在二角以上。則較之鑄用一元硬幣。其鑄費及磨損之損失。費兩者之間究以何者為合算。殊値研究。蓋自新輔幣推行。原有之角票。市上已少見。假如一元之硬幣較一元之紙幣。在使用上為經久。在損耗上為减省。則五角一元硬幣之鑄造。財政部長旣早有宣言。寗非早日鑄造之為愈乎。</p>

<h3>白倫總理宣布　法國對外政策　平等權利共享和平　不問政制進求諒解　係針對希特勒演說而發</h3>
<p>（巴黎）白倫總理於今晚七時三十分、發表無綫電廣播演說、說明法國之對外政策、並對日前德元首希特勒在紐倫堡國社黨大會所發表之演說有所答復、値茲國聯大會開幕伊邇、倫敦五國會議預備談判正在進行中、總理此項演說關係國際局勢頗為重要、茲摘錄如下、白倫之演說大意謂、「法國始終不欲强令任何國家採行任何之政制、卽令法國所認為最賢明最公允之政制，，法國亦不欲强他人為之、蓋法國始終尊重他國之主權、此與法國主權之應受人尊重、其立意正屬相同、法國旣反對國際之宣傳政策、亦復反對戰爭之循環報仇、法國之所願望者無他、世界各國不問其國內採行何種政制、皆和平相處是也、舉凡一切足以促成戰爭之衝突、法國無不欲設法以消弭之、任何國際談判、法國從無一次拒絕參加、要之、民治主義之政府對內崇尙人道之槪念、對外自亦崇尙和平之槪念、吾法人所謂和平、其意卽指國無分大小國與國間、應享平等權利是也、</p>
<p>「和平之鵠的、在於謀國與國間之協調諒解與合作、法國政府對外一言一動、無不循此途徑而行、此則吾人所敢代表法國國民以向全世界申明者也、抑和平之槪念、不僅為民主精神之邏輯的結果、而亦為最切合實際之主張、蓋歷史昭示吾人、眞正穩固之和平、未有能於自私與不義中求之者也、且現代歐洲發生任何武裝衝突、斷不能限制其範圍、而使成為地方化、星星之火足以燎原、戰爭旣具有普遍之性質、則和平自亦非普遍不可」云、</p>
<p>至此、白倫乃就希特勒在紐倫堡大會所作演說中、認為民主政治不能穩固持久之一點、有所答辯、謂「就十九世紀歷史之所昭示、民主政治至少當與以個人權力為基礎之政治同其恒久、彼以個人權力為基礎之政洽、不問此個人為如何偉大之天才、其統治之恒久亦未必能較民主政治而過之、抑法國內部意見、不免有所出入、法國各黨政見亦互相對立、吾人亦不加以否認、然凡屬法人、不問屬於何黨何派、均一致願望和平、且於必要時則均一致團結、以保衛國土、過去之事實如此、今亦猶然云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報批評</h3>
<p>德國愛森城　國社黨機關報「國民日報」頃就法國國務總理昨日所發表之演說、加以評論云、「白倫總理乃以道地的理論家之丰度、謹愼之語詞出之、所惜此項演說、僅以和平為言、對於外交上各重大問題之解决辦法、尤其是德法兩國互相妥恊一事、並無多大裨益」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>匃京　據此間官方人士宣稱、意奧匃三國外長定於最近時期、在維也納舉行會議、此舉並無特別重要之性質、蓋三國外交當局應經常相互磋商、固為意奧匃三國羅馬議定書所規定者也云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>經檢察官孔祥林、函請上海特二法院協傳李警到案偵查、予以不起訴處分、復經聲請再議、經江蘇高等法院首席檢察官處分駁回、趙金泉乃添砌事實、謂何推事不肯拘提李警、收發處不肯收訴李警之狀詞、孔檢察官於李警到案時、未與扣留、不信李警有到案之事實、上年十一月二十四日遇見李警、李警自稱已送五千元與何推事、有馮谷銘可證、狀訴何推事孔檢察官凟職受賄等情到院、經嚴密偵查、依據下述證據、認趙金泉有</p>
<p>誣吿嫌疑</p>
<p>應予依法起訴、證據及其犯罪法條、查趙金泉訴何景岑推事、孔祥林檢察官凟職受賄、無非以去年十一月十四日、在大吉里看見李警搬家、上前質問、十八日庭期、是否到庭、李答以我早已將五千元鈔票送至地方法院何推事、敎你官司不生效力、當李警聲述此語時、有馮谷銘在旁聽見而已、乃質之馮谷銘、　稱我沒有聽見這話、而李警原住方斜路大吉里四號、係去年十月十七日退租、票傳經租人陳心孟到案、呈核租簿屬實、據</p>
<p>陳心孟供</p>
<p>稱、我們讓他幾天房租、大約是十月底搬走、决不會到十一月間搬走、是趙金泉所稱去年十一月十四日見李警搬家等語、全屬不實、李警旣早已搬家、竟稱去年十一月十四日、尙見李警在大吉路搬家、自稱有行賄之事、其為虛構事實、有意誣吿、自屬毫無可疑、該被吿實犯刑法第一百六十九條第一項之罪云云、昨日上午由陳康孫推事、</p>
<p>開庭審訊</p>
<p>命提在押之趙金泉至案、供年卅六歲、高郵人、住麗園路、前為市公安局偵緝員、問你為何吿法院職員、答去年十一月十四日目覩李警坐在搬塲汽車上、我就問他十八號開庭、你到吾、他答到不到沒有什麼關係、他說已送法官五千元、迨至屆期開庭、何推事說李警已經逃走、問你為何要吿孔檢察官呢、答因狀紙送不進、所以山郵遞鍾首席、就是吿李警</p>
<p>便利脫逃</p>
<p>因法院對於李警說已不起訴處分問你不應貿然誣吿、假使抗傳、不能卽說是行賄、况你在檢察處供李警行賄五千元一語、係由證人馮谷銘在旁聽見、質之馮谷銘則否認、足見你誣訴、訊至此、命證人馮谷銘至案、供年卅四歲、東台人、業中醫、去年十月間、我行經方斜路大吉路口、見趙金泉與穿西裝者發生衝突、但聞穿西裝者說、你告我好了、我</p>
<p>預備洋錢</p>
<p>打官司、至於五千元一語、我未聽見、惟旁側確有搬塲汽車等語、末據證人王桂良供稱、在大吉里看門、從前李警住在弄內四號、係去年十月底光景雇汽車搬家、問你曾見李警與人衝突、答不知、並據被吿所延之李銘律師起稱、李警搬家、確用汽車、應請庭上調查、李警究為何日搬遷、問官遂諭趙金泉還押候示</p>

<h3>歐遊日記</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂自倫敦寄</p>
<p>（八月十一日）日來或觀運動、或覽名勝、頗不覺煩寂之苦、吾隊自大會失敗後、報章與論、均有極佳獎評、故歐洲各國、紛紛函雷相邀、吾人為多事觀摩起見、雖明知勝利無望、然亦樂於受敎、於是我隊遂不俟大會閉幕、於今早九時、乘車離柏林、五時乃抵德南佛朗克府」、埠為德歷史名勝及工業總樞、大徐柏林卽設站於此、晚被邀赴觀露天舞台劇、頗新眼界、按此番余對大會印象雖極模糊、惟觀感所及、則各項體育、人進一丈、我進一尺、苟不根本設法刷新、實無迫上水準、希望我國體育當局、受此决敎訓、不知有何振作吾耳、</p>
<p>（十二日）今日本與南德選隊比賽、惟天不作美、大雨如注、故迫得改期、明日上午承市府歡迎、並贈禮品、由余答謝、旋往市內參觀各地及中國文學院內藏中國書籍、古玩、及用文化婚典戲劇衣冠音樂禮節、種種應有盡有、在國外（十四日）早七時離德乘火車人奧大利都城「維也納、抵步已掌燈時候、按奧地足球、為受薪者、其實力之雄為全歐冠、去年英職業來與抗衡、亦　羽而歸、其實力可想見也、</p>
<p>（十五日）上午乘專取遊覽地方、本城歷史名勝甚多、頗有興味、下午與亞軍隊角逐、卒以四對二見敗、然有此成績、殊足日慰、奧人球術、效法蘇格蘭、多用三角法短傳進襲、今日雖敗、亦領略不少佳點也、</p>
<p>（十六日）昨得大會消息、意大利卒獲大曾足球冠軍、聞訊欣羨、上午容主任自柏林趕到會合、下年與職業冠軍强旅相見、吾人一盤散沙、竟以十二對〇慘敗余自有生以來、未嘗身歷此種敗績、眞愧死也、查吾人大敗主因、一則吾人大會敗後、卽訓練荒疎、二則連日火車及戰事過頻、以致下塲受傷者多、僅以九人應戰、三則全隊精神渙散、巳不似南遊時之和衷共濟、塲上動輒口角相爭、今日馮包竟因意氣、彼此拳鬥、殊失斯文及體育本旨也、此番大大敎訓、或將為吾國足球之興奮劑歟、</p>
<p>（十七日）今日大敗之餘、略事休息、下午應劉崇傑公使茶欵、</p>
<p>（十八日）淸晨又征塵僕僕、乘車入瑞士、沿途山洞甚多、風景淸幽、殊不以為苦、晚抵「番梨詒埠、暫駐一宵、在此得遇日本球隊、聞將明日在此顯身手也、</p>
<p>（上九日）上午略事瀏覽、卽繼續乘車登程、傍晚抵世界知名之和平都市「日內瓦」、此為國聯會議地、有山有湖、其秀麗不讓西湖、且氣候亦溫暖宜人、人言瑞士風景甲天下、洵非過譽也、</p>
<p>（二十日）早餐畢、乘專車請嚮導導往參觀景物、得其口講指　、甚覺有趣、閱報、日本隊昨在「書黎治」埠以一比十六大敗特敗、足見瑞士足球實力、亦非易與、幸吾人今日振刷精神、努力奮鬥、卒以三比二佔得勝利、余個人連中三元、後衛大生表演最佳、歐遊得一勝利、殊覺難能可貴、實堪快慰、蒙當地僑胞設讌欺待、盡歡而散、</p>
<p>（二十一日）九時、又聞輪聲軋軋、向巴黎進發、日來載賽載奔、疲勞過甚、車甫開行、各員都枕廂尋夢、形容憔悴、眞一隊可憐虫也、下午六時半抵巴黎、夾站歡迎者有大使代表、法政府體育部長、及僑界多人、甚覺熱閙可感、巴黎環球第一風流都會、慾海橫流、人肉市塲、城開不夜、其淫風之熾、甚於歐洲其他都市、前聞人言、當不敢信、故身臨目覩、乃知人世間、眞有此怪現狀也、</p>
<p>（二十二日）法國職業足球、始自四年前、好手多聘自外國、其實力頗為雄厚、今吾人與之對壘、表演精彩、結果各二平手、亦一佳作也、賽後、法球會中人竟來詢余有意留法食足球飯吾、並云將以三萬佛郞為聘金、月薪二千五百佛郞、余以年事已高、行將退穩、乃笑謝之、然余之球藝、竟惹得職業界之注意、亦快事也、</p>
<p>（二十三日）昨夜忽患腹瀉、今早吾隊拔隊至法西哈夫」Havre埠角逐、余因疴不能隨軍、事後聞各人施展極劣、竟以零比六大敗、余不參戰、當受不少影響、</p>
<p>（二十四日）上午往購飛機票、因余明日將獨飛瑞典參觀工商事業也、下午承大使館請往茶叙、晚偕友人往觀裸體跳舞、光怪陸離、眼界為之一新、雖　者來斯、亦將張目矣、</p>
<p>（二十五日）早七時趁機獨飛瑞京、「士托咸Stock-holm因余受職瑞典洋行、不得不偷暇一走、至總行一觀究竟、順道考察工商業也、機行八小時、始安抵目的地、沿途經比利士、德國、丹麥諸地、俯覽歐洲、別饒興趣、而瑞典各處均慶昇平、如在桃花源均安居樂業、與巴黎實判若天壤也、</p>
<p>（二十九日）數日來瑞通遊典中卒與世界著名球星「亞力諸大城名勝、並參觀工商實業甚多、增進智識不少、各地均極受歡迎、每至一處、均有余照片披刊報端、並引吾隊不能到瑞典比賽為大憾事、今日從「哥頓拔」Goobenborg（瑞典海岸）始返倫敦、途經荷蘭京城時、機中侍役吿余、謂吾隊前夜在此燈戰、以三比五失敗也、下午五時安抵倫敦、按英京為世界第一人市、地方遼闊、人口八百萬、交通繁雜、吾隊已先於昨夜由荷京抵此、今日且被邀往參觀職業球賽也、惜余至塲時、巳曲終而散、幸於更衣室與詹士」君等握手相見、生平大願、旦得償、眞大快我心也、與各同志重晤後、被邀至南市觀燈景、頗覺有趣、在此有兩塲比賽、均對業餘冠軍隊結果當後陳也、　又吾隊準九月二日早離英京入意大利、四日乘Conte　Rasso「康德羅素」輪歸國、大的九月二十四日便可抵港、（九月二日）八月三十一日對Corilmtians隊以二比三僅負、博得無限佳評、紀良與余最受人歡迎、又九月一日對Casuals隊復以二比五失敗、吾人球賽至是乃吿結束、準今日往意大利、趁輪作歸計矣、</p>
<h3>足球友誼賽第一聲　今日東華戰葡萄牙　在下午三時半巿體育塲交鋒</h3>
<p>東華足球隊、本屆自改以市體育塲為主塲後、煥然一新、現為試練脚頭起見、特于今日下午三時半、的本埠西人勁旅葡萄牙隊在市體育塲、作友誼賽、開本季及市體育塲第一次之先聲、門票分一元六角三角三種、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>交通問題</p>
<p>（一）住南市及法租界者可乘五路電車、或十四路無軌電車、或五路公共汽車至火車站寳山路口改乘四五路華商公共汽車直達運動塲、（二）在滬西者可乘一路電車或一路公共汽車至河南路下車、改乘五路公共汽車至寳山路口、（三）購一元券六角券者、可在寳山路口乘四路汽車至運動塲下車、由西大鬥及三四號看台人口、（四）購三角券者可在寳山路口乘五路公共汽車至游泳池下車、由廿五六號看合入口、（五）由寳山路口至球塲、不論五路或四路來回車資每人二角一分、（六）坐祥生汽車直達運動塲車資一元、（七）自備汽車祗能停在塲外四週、（八）專觀足球比賽之中國地界汽車照會、現公用局正在趕辦下星期定可辦好、</p>
<p>比賽精彩</p>
<p>東華本季自曹秋事脫離後、萬象華晋而庖代、孫賈出席世運未歸、勢難趕及第一塲比賽、故東華不得在甲組陣容中、多听羅致、以供庖代、而萬象華自受西聯處罰以來、迄今方恢復入塲資格、老馬識途、倍增勇氣、他如義臣之中堅、文繡之右冀、均屬東華本屆之新陣綫、今日對葡萄一役、實為測騐其以後之進展、此賽雖屬友誼、性質實為至要、葡人為去年中上强隊、今日亦必奮力應戰、其戰情之精彩緊張、自可斷言、東華陣容如下、</p>

<p>昨華商證券交易所、因九期份期貨餘日無幾、多空雙方稍有掉期、檯面似比較熱鬧、市價亦堪稱堅定、與其為時局關係而上漲、母寗為籌碼供求關係、而稍稍軋上、存賬數目、因此愈益减少、前途諒亦無多大波瀾也、趨勢當仍不能晚離盤旋狀况、昨日經過、上午開盤、比較堅穩、十號四十三及四十七號等均有買進、市價上漲雖祗一角左右、趨勢頗稱一致、决盤旋卽無力、竟又一律回小五分一角、午後交易、除乙種沂期較為熱鬧外、餘則寥寥無幾、兩盤交易均甚平淡、多數毫無上落、少數好五分一角、市價之呆滯、似已斟酌盡善、無可增减、故檯面成交、每每爭持於二分半之微數、亦可為罕有之局面、市價結果、除本月份甲種好二角外、餘則一致好五分一角、戊種無升降、九六本月竟抬至十元零二角之新高價、亦無非盲人瞎馬、步驟紊亂之狀况而已、行見十元大關、勢必打破、成交總數、共計六百三十八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　紗巿平凡起伏有限</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、局勢安定、大概不脫徘徊之象、但現紗客方銷胃尙健、人心良好、同業中仍因存紗趨减、傾向多方、但價高漲時、外商亦來放出、故市態入於盤旋之局也、</p>
<p>金雞祗小五角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、本月隨上日餘氣、續漲五角、但拍至遠月、轉趨和平而勿動、塲中交易殊稀、多空兩方、勢均力敵、二盤以後、市態疲弱、望泰興、瑞大·賡豐·福康均未賣出、步步下落、但跌勢甚微、迨至收盤、聞現紗交易仍有八百餘包之譜、市盤稍回上幾角、錦昌·合興·長餘·愼記等則購進、結果各月比上日收盤所均跌三·四·五角、午後開盤尙好、二三盤復落、塲中交易殊狹、人氣平凡、迨至收盤、因現紗生意尙不薄、略形回上、結果各月比上午收盤價相仿、查賣出裕記一千一百五十包、恒益一千四百五十包、大豐一千四百五十包、振大一千二百包、賡豐一千四百五十包、瑞大一千三百五十包、望泰興一千五百包、福康一千包、同和八百包、買進合與二千七百五十包、錦昌一千一百包、裕大九百包、興昌一千三百五十包、長餘一千一百包、愼記一千四百包、信成九百包泰昌八百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>新棉出貨尙未暢旺</h3>
<p>棉市穩定、蓋以各路來源未擁、且廠方搶新仍殷產區出貨不暢、因　現棉售價堅昂、近期空方活動抵補、市價提起矣、但海外棉市平常云、</p>
<p>近期補空尤殷</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉微漲一至五磅音、印棉漲跌互見、上下〇·二五至〇·七五羅比、大阪三品花跌一角半至二角，市塲人心平庸、各月參差不一、上落五分、但入後恒益·瑞大·大豐·信誠·生源·同和·大昶等又來拋賣、中途回挫一一角、迨至三收盤、因各廠搶新甚力、到貨無剩、某君在十月抵空而漲、遠月帶高、大孚·合興·新昶·聚興·豐泰·慎記·永大等買進亦夥、結果各月比上日收盤價漲跌五分至一角半、午後開盤、市態異常平靜、市塲成交甚稀、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一角至一角半、查賣出恒益四千八百担、大豐三千三百担、振大一千九百担、昶記一千二百担、瑞大七千四百担、長豐一千二百担、大昶一千三百担、同和七千六百担、源興昌一千一百担、協成一千担、通記一千擔、買進大孚九千九百担、吉豐一千一百担·聚興一千八百担、裕大二千六百担、合與五千九百祖、長餘一千九百担、豐泰一千五百担、愼記三千四百担、永大一千六百担、新昶二千一百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>美棉晨初買氣甚濃</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况活潑堅定、各月漲四至七磅音、晨初利物浦消息良好、同業及外商買進、同時風潮趨勢不定、買氣甚濃、旋以套賣增加、又復回軟、收盤堅定、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一至六磅音、英棉現貨不動、期貨漲二三點、印棉初因空戶抵補而堅、後因歐洲出口商售出奧姆辣及平果爾而回、計平果爾跌〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·二五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·七五羅比、　電錄左、（十七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　現粉盤廉售　期粉近疲遠穩</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近疲遠穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二三角、坎拿大好三四角、當開價時、近期因實銷不佳、現粉送盤、無論標準與非標準、均較目下之標準行市、喊價均小三五分不等、（係配外埠客帮本街則吾）故近期開價、遂小去一分外、十二月份以下、則以洋麥仍好、反漲一分零、迨至下午開盤、交易轉淸、市氣已呈盤旋、惟本廠粉為迎合客銷起色、天津交貨、祇喊三元二角半、聞做開數萬包、故照實際情形推考、標準之硬擯、徒為人心所左右云、</p>
<h3>粉銷不振麥價帶疲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致平靜、因芝加哥坎拿大兩處、仍漲二三四角、利物浦小一便士零、故開價後、各月份賣買、均未暢旺、較前日有一分上落、迨至下午開盤、交易較暢、市氣帶軟、因現粉銷塲、未見活動、麥市人心、自難帶振、各月份較上午回落一二分、現麥市面、特高貨仍然平穩、中决略懈、目下現粉則暗盤廉售、麥市則仍堅定、原料貴而熟貨賤、殊覺匪夷所思耳、開山東穎州五元一角、决零五分、瑤灣麥五元、次四元九角六分、沙河集麥五元零三分、東臺麥四元八角七分、次八角一分、高郵六合麥四元九角、江北麥四元七角七分、决七角半、紹興麥四元丸角、由福新辦六千包、申大辦一千四百包云、</p>
<h3>東新粳到稀加起二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源到十四五號、貨共三千餘石、而零銷仍懈、包胃僅靑島帮辦三百餘包、故厚薄粳行情如舊、惟東新粳貨乏胃香、提升二尺、杜尖境似新粳、亦見帶緊、羊尖到貨旣旺、去化亦滯、致呈軟勢、陰變元守常態、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源四十一二號、市上各色去胃尙佳、市價破粳薄稻新客尖新埠尖變元市價平定、新羊團杜尖挺立、西新粳貨稀、略形緊扣、東新粳價加二角、</p>
<h3>客秈粵方去路復暢</h3>
<p>昨辦云二萬餘包……巿面立見振作昨日客秈新到仍活、長江一路來貨源源不絕、粵漢路尙未暢通之前、粵省辦貨仍以滬巿為主、昨日粵帮辦胃更貪、辦云漢口靖港沙巿南京各路糙米達二萬一千四百包之、粵銷一旺、市面立見振作、汕頭帮與本街亦暢辦贛湘機米、北洋與甬帮亦有二三百包之點綴、市氣頗旺、行情亦見回好四五分至近角不一、全日開出贛米三千一百卅包、湘機砶米一千七百十五、又糙靖六千包、沙市漢口糙一萬五千包、百包、台秈五十包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠方討價較昻　絲巿成交更少</h3>
<p>最近一週來、國外絲市、逐呈盤旋、翌昨日美市塲、開價均各突漲、橫濱現貨猛漲二十元、期貨上漲十四元、紐的日華絲品價均各漲三四分、七八勻度二〇·二二條紋之標準絲、現貨漲三分半、期貨　四分半、以致本埠人心益堅、廠方對於討價、升騰四五十元、因之成交轉小、昨川灰經略有若干售開、價格見漲云、</p>
<h3>中美絲巿最近狀况　上月美國消費增加存底减少　本埠絲市內銷暢達外銷疲滯</h3>
<p>上月美國生絲統計報吿、消費數量為四二、〇一六担、較七月份增加五千三百餘担、存底二九、八二五担、較前减少三百餘祖、形成消費增加存底薄弱之狀、根據去年統計觀之、（見附表）預計本月消費數量、當能逐增百分之十至十五、因之賣方不願脫貨、故絲價挺秀、而市氣甚靜、致造成人造絲活躍之機會、聞紐的小型商人、對於上海二〇—二二、黃白廠經需要甚殷、惟該項生絲、為數不多、上海絲市、因經營投機者甚多、成為外銷疲滯銷內暢遠之狀、二〇—二二、條紋七八分勻度生絲、價格上升約二三十元、又悉紐的裯廠方面、對於十月份用絲尙堪維持、並無急購之意、絲價暫時或將稍疲也、</p>

<p>昨日綠茶市况仍淸淡、全市僅同孚保昌華茶永發等行、購進珍眉珠茶共計四百餘箱、抽蕊珍眉、市價縮至百元關內、路莊珠茶縮　七十元、較前又跌七八元、祁門紅茶、自皖贛紅茶總運銷處、擬謀整個推銷後、昨日怡和協和錦隆等行、對此均甚注意、聞均有電訊發出、華洋雙方、目前正在談判中云、</p>
<p>據茶業公會報告云、咋綠茶市與前無異、交易非常淸　、仍僅各路抽蕊珍眉、同孚華茶保昌等行、續有零星成交、及貢熙自售價逐步减低後、白頭行進辦尚稱不靜、日來亦頗多成交、其他珍眉及平水各茶等、仍寂然無聲云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　各路需求大增　廠布不敷分配</h3>
<p>昨標紗花平平、棉布市况亦趣平靜、日商白貨·細布、細斜等貨、最近三天內又有二千餘件、大批開出、因出數不旺、心思非常堅俏、細斜原有存擱近以染廠需求大增、現貨提取一空、如龍頭細斜存貨三百件於三日內出淸、粵帮對於本　　斜催裝甚急、常州各廠出品交粵帮定貨者占十分之七、本廠十六磅粗布烟台帮、上月訂定大生慶豐等廠出品未交者尙達三百餘包、每日僅能派交十數包、花色貨派貨因定貨件額更巨、客戶更繁、各廠出數有限、派交困難、日益加甚、客帮添貨天津帮及西北陝西等帮稍吿平淡、而粵帮滇帮及漢口蘆州等帮需要加儂、本街因門市營業增色、辦胃續健、閱雀最近成立檢私委員會、昨駐滬閩客商調查各廠商標出品、以備檢私會分別登記云、</p>

<h3>海味堆翅加稅漲價　魚膠貨少憂堅</h3>
<p>（堆翅）自海關進口稅由三等加徵二等以來、貨本劃高、且市上各檔存底枯薄、更因川漢帮去胃健　、致貨益缺、售盤日升、現市高龍鬚堆價六百二三十元、跟脚較靈者亦售五百七八十元、金山小單堆五百元、餘如銀絲·三餘·五羊等貨、刻下均吿斷檔、</p>

<h3>人與非人</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在　　性的婦女生活的全部，可以從中劃出一條鴻溝。於是，生活分了兩部份，一部份是處女時代：亦可以說是「黃金時代」這時期，如天空的飛鳥，宇宙之大，足够伊迴旋　　，遼遠的前程，使伊希望無窮，週遭的環境是明朗的，奮發的，美麗的。部份是嫁後時代，桎梏，鎖練，層層加上伊的身體，如飛鳥之一旦投進綱羅，關進狹籠，懸在私人的屋檐下，在伊面前，宇宙是狹隘起來，前程被高牆厚壁所　，雖幸而不至於受凍挨餓，終究做了依賴別人的寄生蟲。會唱會呌，習毛豐美的時期，猶能受人愛護，等到嗓音敗了，習毛落了，伊的命運，就在不可知之數。</p>
<p>進一步說，婦女在前一時代所過着的，是向上的「人」的生活，在後一時代所過着的是往往屬於不合理的，近乎「非人」式的生活。有智識無智識的女子所遭受到的待遇，在原質上並不兩樣，而智識階級的女子所感到痛苦的反應却更深。在對建殘餘和傳統觀念沒有完全消滅，家庭制度沒有改革以前，（從大家庭中分組出小家庭來，還是不够的。）這苦痛將為一般婦女所不能倖免。</p>
<p>一個女子在過着學校生活的時候，走路是健捷的，說話是響亮的，志向是遠大的，抱負是宏偉的，伊不肯　向無論何人示弱，不輕易說一句求恕的話，大部份思想繫向社會，繫向人羣。這就是合口理的，值得誇耀的「人」的生活。當此時期，一些有懷抱企圖的女子想當當非人生活的個中滋味，幷且立志要革除不合理的非人生活，想做一個女革命者為天下女子們造福。然而等到踏進了這個生活環境，心境和視綫被「世故」「習慣」逼得狹窄了，處女時代的驕矜完全消失了，不由自主的往「屈服」中沉下，沉下，永遠抬不起頭來！</p>
<p>世界上有多少追求讚美女子的男性，就有相等的視女。子為「掌中物」的男性。男是人，女不是人嗎！為什麼女的祇能隱忍，屈服，在非人的生活現狀之下？</p>
<h3>世界婦女名人傳（續）</h3>
<p>— 魯沙白</p>
<p>卡魯依基那和阿爾杜錫那同是從貧窮的家庭出身的，她的父親是杜瓦縣的一個窮苦的百姓，九歲時她就作着許多勞苦的工作和傍人看顧小孩，但看她缺不像受過饑寒的人，而像一個威風凜凜的大力士。她委有年靑就參加革命，當十五六歲在化學工廠和織物廠做工時，曾鼓勵工人罷工，努力宣傳革命工作，國內幾次的暴動，她都奮勇地出入於於槍林彈雨中指揮羣衆，眞不愧為一個女丈夫。</p>
<p>她今年才四十歲，體格精力都十分旺盛。現任中央候補委員，並作地方黨委員會書記。</p>
<p>她雖然榮任着黨的要職，但為到充實自己的頭腦，獲得豐富的學識，進了莫斯科的瑞德羅夫大學三年來的刻苦努力，終於達到她的目的，在黨中央裏面獲得一般同志的好評，她今後的發展更未可限量。</p>
<h3>卡魯依基那</h3>
<p>與卡魯依基那中內候補委員並衡的是蘇聯統制委員露莎利亞·莤羅復納·珍姆利雅雅奇卡。她生於一千八百七十六年，當卡魯依基那未出世以前她已參加革命運動，所以就年齡上來說，在上般女革命粗中，她可算是一位老前輩。</p>
<p>除第五次的黨大會因她入獄沒有參加外，每次開黨大會她都參加，一千九百零五年第一次革命和一千九百十七年第二次革命時，她充當黨委員會的書記作着活動。她和樸列汗諾夫，伊里奇等革命先動都是知交。她在彼得堡，莫斯科，基夫，奧德撤，愛卡特利諾斯拉夫，巴庫等歐俄各地作過長期間的活動，她的名聲在柯倫泰之上，為一般市民所尊崇。</p>
<p>她是一個頭腦冷靜的熱情家，但在冷靜中，人子分精　　，三　有智　，赤軍占領克里米後，她卽處理當地的黨反革命根據地著稱的克里米，整頓成如現在這樣的蘇維埃克里米，這是她最大的功續。總之她在蘇聯的黨裏有很悠久的歷史。現在她已六十多歲，今後在政治上她雖沒有多大的發展，但作為一個鮑爾塞維克的元老，聯邦政府對她是表示敬意的，曾贈她赤旗和列寗等章。</p>

<h3>黃浦江漁婦的副生活</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>住在上海的人們，恐怕不會知道黃浦江裏有這種可慘的女子罷。當外洋輪船靠岸，或是離港的時候，因為船身巨大，不易掉動，時常要費了兩三小時的長時間。這時滿船的旅客，都站在甲板的船沿上，望着岸上的親友。兩三雙小船拚命的划近輪船來船上都是一男一女的多，夫婦或是父女，雙手划着長漿，在黃濁的水面上飛掠着。雖然好容易划近了輪船，因為鐵板的船身，光滑得無從攀援，不久又為浪頭濕了出去，只得再接再厲的划近來。</p>
<p>樣子好像是黃浦江上的漁船，這不過是無可奈何的副業罷了。男子立在小船的尾上，划着漿使小船不脫離輪船的邊緣。女子便放下了漿，站在船頭上，握着一根二丈多長的竹竿，竿頭繫着掏魚的小綱。伊用全身的力量把炙綱昇到甲板的船沿上，面孔已漲得血紅着，丫在顛動不停的船上。「哈羅！門耐（英語之錢字）」伊不住向上面喊着，用伊唯一的英語。更脫空了一雙手，指着小船上船上的小兒女，並且舉手額際，來了個軍禮。「哈羅！門耐！」有幾個慈善的旅客，丟了幾分錢在他的綱裏。伊勉力的耐着頭骨的酸痛，仰着頭呌喊。到輪船啟行為止，只得了一二角錢。沒有得到分文的當然也有。女子的呻吟聲，比較容易博得人們的同情。男子所以在後面划漿，而使女子擔任這種搖尾乞憐的勾當，大約便是利用這點心理。但是遇着吝嗇的旅客，只指點着作輕視的微笑，或是攝在鏡箱裏面，作為到中國來的紀念品，那有什麼辦法。</p>
<p>輪船上的水手和碼頭上的工人，因為他們要妨碍工作，便盡力的阻止他們。一個水手在輪船上抓住了伊的漁綱，伊的身子將被他提在空間了，兩個人在下面苦苦的哀求着碼頭上的水手把伊們的繩子扭斷了，或是不許將竹篙鈎着埠頭。小船失去了憑藉，顛動得十分利害，浪花衝到中艙的小孩子身上。漿和竹篙都丟入了汪裏，隨着波浪流去了。他們急得用全力的掙扎着，還要想掏取已失的東西。他們憤怒得無處發洩，只得任意的駡着，咒着，直到被駡的已聽不見他們的聲音。</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>聶靈瑜女士會見記</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>上海公共租界偌大一個區域，除了我們中國人自己辦的各級學校以外，工部局設立的中小學。數目很有限，譬如像女子中學，到現在還只有一所，而且僅有五年的歷史；工部局一年收入幾千萬，我華人所納的捐稅，當然佔　大多數，而局方用在華人敎育經費的數字，恐怕還在西僑敎育費之下，這是一件很不公平的事！工部局女子中學的校長楊聶靈瑜，是一位定有辦學經騐的女子，我很早就聽得人家說。前天傍晚，纔和她第一次會見，我們談了很久，並參觀學校的全部，現在把所得的材料，介紹給讀者：</p>
<p>女中的校址在滬西新加坡路，那是很偏僻的地方，交通也不方便，校舍是新建的三層洋房，式樣很　登，基地也寬廣，　說仿照德國最新式的建築；的確光綫與空氣，比任何學校都合式，內部的佈置。更是完備得異乎　常。例如敎室除固定以外，有分科的敎室，每敎室的後部，附一間學生衣帽間，玻窗裝置很特別，開了窗，憑你怎樣的狂風，不會直接吹到學生的身上，卽使嚴冬的季節，窗門可照常開着，空氣自然不會溷濁了。黑板採淡綠色，不傷害目光，其下有櫥窗，供一級學生放置參攷書，講台偏在左邊，不妨碍學生的視綫。這麼寬大的校舍，到晚上便鴉雀無聲，原來師生五百餘人，沒有一個住校的，只留幾個校役看管而已。</p>
<p>校長聶女士，是女留學生的前輩，當她中學畢業的時候，中國還沒有女子大學，那時男女不許同校，祇好進美國的密西根大學，先研究數理，得碩士位，回國後在九江當敎六年，再進芝加哥大學攻敎育，回來任南昌葆靈中區校長，敎會學校聘中國女子任校長，她還算第一人。民國十八年第三次渡美考察敎育，二十年秋被聘任今職，所以女中是她一手創辦的。她對於女子敎育有好幾點感想：（一）辦理敎育，應做　際工作，不唱高調，（二）適應社會需要，注重科學敎育；（三）除必修課程之外，應授以家庭新智識；（四）近年女子服務社會的效能，較前進步，但比　歐美日本各國，還差得很遠，我們不能遇於自滿，希望女子職業，更形發達，不過不正當的職業，却未敢贊同；（五）現行會考制度覺得太偏，女生因生理與心理的不同，不能與男生同一考試，而現在會考的科目，男女都是一例，我以為是應當的。</p>
<p>她對於學生的訓練及辦學的方針，也很有可取之處，她說每天早上第一課之前，各級學生舉行宣誓，詞曰：「我們在師長敎導，同學督促之下，努力學業，遵守校規，刻苦耐勞，友愛親睦，培養男敢進取的精神，銀鍊强健壯全的身體；服　「非以役人，乃役於人」的校訓，肩負救國的責任，向着光明的前途猛進，謹此宣誓！」上了兩課之後，就有「公民訓練，」方　是這樣：每能有一位導師，負　一級訓導的責任，逢月　集合全校員生於一堂，聽校長訓話，米　由導師解答　級學生提出的難題；水矅各級討論專門問題，譬如本學期的總題是健康問題，那末所論就不出健康的範圍；木矅各級學生報告時事，分國際的國內的各項重要新聞；金矅為學生演講，分中文與英文兩組；士矅敎請名人演講。如此周而復始，多給學生以課外智識的活動。至於辦學的方針，大致有四點：（一）養成學生健全的體格，與獨特的人格；（二）本校學生都出身於中上級的家庭，所以要訓練她們做領袖的才能，將來進可以升大學，退可以為社會與家庭服務；（三）家政固然要注重，而怎樣服務於社會，也需要切實的指導；（四）訓練她們崇尙道德，養成勤勞耐苦的精神，我們不敢奢望，但願能達到區區的目標。</p>
<h3>聶靈瑜女士</h3>
<p>最後她對於現代婦女有兩點意見：</p>
<p>（甲）養成健康的身體：</p>
<p>（一）不以修飾柔媚為女性美</p>
<p>（二）注意個人衛生，家庭衛生，　童術生以及公共衛生；</p>
<p>（三）使身體發育平衡，銀鍊壯健的體格，然後在技術上，學問上建立良好的基礎。</p>
<p>（乙）應有澈底的覺悟：</p>
<p>（一）肩負民族復與運動的任務——抱立已立人達已達人的互助精神，為社會服務；</p>
<p>（二）應用所習的技能——現在都市的婦女，大半沈溺於享樂的境蜀裏，忘却自身的責任，卽有學識技能，也不實地應用，完全埋葬在家庭的範圍裏，或者是屈服在丈夫與孩子的役使之下，甚至完全沈醉在伴舞與宴會之中，這　極端的錯誤，我們婦女應當應用自己的技能達於家庭範圍之外。</p>
<p>總之，我們要抱刻苦的精神，應付中國現在這個非常時期，時時要有為大衆利益而犧牲的決心，以實現國防婦女的重任。</p>
<h3>泰縣的婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>這裏雖然　着的泰縣婦女的生活，其實可以包括揚屬八縣，　上得江南風氣之先，可是風土人情，却大同而小異；我寫泰縣婦女生活，也就代表了揚州八屬，伊們不知道什麼是「婦運」，受新思潮敎育洗禮的佔不到百分之五，能哼兩句梁山泊祝英台的七字斷，看兩頁三國志濟公傳，就算知書識禮「那摩溫」咧；伊們沒有什麼奢望，心坎裏，腦髓裏，只要將來博一個「母儀足式」，「坤範猶存」的四字獎狀，便樂得含笑九泉了；現在且憑我的假想，分成三個階段。</p>
<p>第一所謂百分之五的學校畢業生，大抵不過初中和一些師範程度而已，伊們不求經濟獨立，在家當小妲，出嫁做少奶奶，多半是委員，律師，小老爺夫人，敎員是千分之一的奇蹟；總之，依然逃不了「相夫敎子」的藩籬，伊們為丈夫事業上盡些招待責任，是變相的內助，空餘光陰，張公館少奶奶赴些無目的的宴侍，相互間麻將八圈，多半便這樣把歲月消磨去了。</p>
<p>第二個階段的婦人，家庭經濟是相當的富裕，主持些家政，養育子女，是這些婦人主婪的職守，執帶洗衣，燒火汲水，僱一名娘姨，靑年少婦，秉承阿姑，助理瑣碎家務；中年婦人呢，主中　，司出納，方城之戰，葉子之戲，逢場作戲，不時也玩上一兩回；老年婦人咧，在這第二階段裏，克勤克儉，一樣間茶　米，照拂開門七件事，不然淸磐紅魚，顧養天年，荒唐些的便沈辭在小賭場中。</p>
<p>第三階段的婦人最淸苦，可以代表一般婦人生活，洗衣漿裳，燒飯煮粥，　兒號脈女，掃地抹桌，都一身　領着，總之這裏的婦人，是在「夫榮妻貴小兒嬌」下生活着，我說的這種家庭，當然　鮑不足，自己沒有針　做，幫人家縫衣縫裳，在這變秋之交，伊們唯一副業，是結製綱，這手工業江南很少發現，　　　　　　　　與隆　　　　　　　不　而走了；可　　　理起先。編成綫，再　成　。手術　熱的，一天可　一丈。一元資　，可得三元貨價；衣食之養，不　不補，唯其是被星　目的操作！要秉養食不辦味！　不婁眼的精神！纔能　到這蠅頭微利呢。</p>
<h3>職業女子訪問所得：新亞酒店女職員的思想與生活</h3>
<p>— 賢影</p>
<p>近年來，　國婦子職業　進　，顯　有極速度的澎漲性，最初多　是小學敎員與工廠中女工，繼而　政府機關與商業社會，也漸次有了女職員，於是乎對於那班職業女子的生活調查與思想檢閱，成為一個新的有興趣工作，我這裏所要記述的，可以說是在很多種女子職業中最新頴的一種，也許兩個廣泛而極有發展的新途是女子職業將來最可效力的所在，那就是旅館事業。</p>
<p>在一個夏末的下午，我驅車至神秘的北四川路頭上，那條一字長蛇的紅房子現在我眼前，我在偶然的走動中却找到了一件特殊的工作，那就是我想　此下午去訪問一下那新亞大酒店中的幾位女職員。</p>
<p>女子成為旅館事業中的從業員，在中國也許還很少，但在外國，一方面因為旅館事業之發達與重視，一方面因為認識女子的特有長處—細心，和悅，忍耐等，更適合於旅館店員的職位，所以女子在旅館空中像已造成特殊的地位，如Women　in　Hotel　Business書中對於女子應經營旅館事業之推重，結論說：「相信幾年後女子將獨霸那她們應霸的事業中」倒也有她的可能呀！</p>
<p>在我國完全自己經營的旅館中，新亞大酒店當然是首屈一指了，經理鍾標氏可說是「全國一人」的旅館專家，在他經營下的新亞，着重引用女職工也為重要政策　　，所以現在他已僱用女工　十餘人，分佈各樓專司擦地手揩窗洗滌整理等粗工作，至於女職員方面，却全在地下層，大槪可分為四部：</p>
<p>一，問事處的問訊員計三人着淡紅色西式制服</p>
<p>二，電梯的司機員計四人着淡綠色西式制服</p>
<p>三，中菜間的女侍者計六人着淡淡綠色服外有白圍</p>
<p>四，電話間接綫生計六人另外還有一位在衣帽間的總計四部共二十人，我現在訪問所得，只不過在他們每一部中任選五位做代表的個案調查，那五位卽：</p>
<p>問事處—鮑瑪琍小姐</p>
<p>電梯處—陳玉屏小姐</p>
<p>中菜間—章佩儀小姐</p>
<p>電話間—蘇秀珍小姐</p>
<p>中菜兼電梯的—陳秀琴小姐</p>
<p>她們相似點是：</p>
<p>（一）皆是粵籍人，而在上海多年，能說極流利的　粵語言，普通的國語英文。</p>
<p>（二）年齡皆在二十歲上下相差一二歲，除却瑪琍皆未婚。</p>
<p>（三）薪水皆在每月四十元至五十元之間，而並不把牠當作給她們家庭唯一的進欵。（未完）</p>
<p>徵文</p>
<p>本刋變十節專號徵求文稿，須思想　進，立論切實，每篇不得超過八百字，本月底截止收稿。</p>
<h3>舊衣服</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>天像逢到了什麼悲傷的事件，整日夜在那裏哭泣，一連差不多要有三天了，像這樣再鬧下去，少不得又是一個火水災的荒年的局面了；米價漲到一石十八元，二十元，豆腐也漲價，肉也漲價，這些都是免不了的事啊！</p>
<p>惟靑坐在狹小得像扶梯脚下一樣的帳房間裏，眼望着天，想得很出神，想到了這些可怕的預測，他眞不能再把方才經理先生交給他的一批帳算下去了。然而米漲價，肉漲價的事畢竟還是未來的變化，目前還可以硬着頭皮不去想它；所為難的是他記得早上離家的　兒，蕊珠關照他，大實只有件齊整的衣服，連着穿了一個星期，實在太髒了，如某再穿着上學堂去，的確太難看，要給他連夜洗起來，下雨的天，怎容易乾呢？所以最好敎惟靑上他連襟　岱山那邊去商量討一兩件乾淨的舊衣服來換換。不錯，兪家是近來很發財呢！記得上次蕊珠的姊：麗珠帶着伊的大兒子雪玲利惟靑家來時，身上穿得多麼講究啊！據他們隨來的下人說，這個孩子有着二三十件一季節的衣服在衣箱裏呢！而大寶的身材恰好和出差不多，所以蕊珠想出來的這個救急的辦法，委實是很聰明的。然而惟靑想：自已的　子　服做不起，却去問人家討舊衣服穿，臉上眞是怪難堪的，最好還是不去；那末去置新的吧，雖說兩二元，三四元的也未嘗沒有，但　　底還有十八天，家裏祇剩十一塊洋錢，怎能　多此一筆額外支出呢！他這樣打算了半天，結果還是　着雨到兪家去，在　珠的一劇怪難看的商孔之下，討了兩年舊衣服。</p>
<p>到家是七點一刻了，蕊珠，大寶，錫昌，小羅，四個人正在捧着飯碗等他；蕊珠一　他來着一個紙包，便帶着高興的神氣喊道：</p>
<p>「好了！失蜜的衣服來了！」</p>
<p>打開紙包一看，大寶也笑了；原來大寶自己所有的衣服總是很便宜的洋布，式子也舊得很，而今天惟靑從兪家討來的　兩身舊衣服却全是綱的，做工又細巧，式校又好看，大寶覺得眞比自己家　做的新衣服好多了！</p>
<p>惟　和蕊珠看大　高興，自然也覺得很快活，尤其是錫昌和小羅兩個小弟妹更是　　得了不得。</p>
<p>第二天，大寶上學去，先生和同學都不自覺他向他多看了幾眼；大寶心上想這一定是裯衣服的緣故，便歡喜得了不得。從此他無論上學或隨着爸爸上公園去都不願意再穿自己的衣服，一定要穿打兪家討來的兩身舊衣服。但如果有人問題，他却始終說是自家做的，並且還　三的叮囑他爸爸和媽媽不許告訴人家是討來的。</p>
<p>不幸有一天，在另一家親戚家裏，大賽和雪玲碰到了：雪玲這孩子的記性眞好，一是　便拉着大寶的衣服笑道：</p>
<p>「這是我的舊衣服啊！是你爸爸來問我們討去的！」</p>
<p>給他這麼　說，大寶覺得　面的人全在笑他了，一顆小臉漲得像下過了染缸一樣的紅，終於逃到蕊珠身邊去哭起來了：蕊珠也仿佛聽得人家都在悄悄地說舊衣服地討的舊衣服「怪不得不稱身」「原來是拾的舊衣服」……………在羞憤交　的情緒下。無　的母親只得異謹着可憐的兒子逃走了。</p>

<p>癩痢</p>
<p>第二十二號，斐諾君問：舍弟患癩痢頭，請介紹藥品。</p>
<p>答『皮治藥軟膏』可治（Pixrol　Oint-ment）</p>
<p>背部刺痛</p>
<p>第廿三號，魯林君問：（一）敝人會患梅毒及淋巴。淋病早愈，梅毒亦已十年，中間注射六〇六無數針，但總不能除根。前廳某醫師之勸、自〇·四五起至〇·七五止，共計注射六針，騐血已清。該醫師命令余半年後再騐一次，余已病既痊愈。何必再損失血液，即未再往。上月忽然腰痛，有如刺痛，放射四圍，同時頭痛。請問，（一）是何原因？（二）有無危險？（三）如何治療？（四）先生可以包治否？（五）先生騐血幾元？（六）吸阿片可以治否？</p>
<p>答：是前毒未清，病犯脊髓，即『脊髓梅毒』。此病之成，在君不聽醫者之言，大凡正式醫生，其言可　，决不欺騙閣下。乃閣下惜五西西之血液。須知人身血液有十磅之多，去此區區五西西，正如滄海中少去一粟。造血器官無病的人，數分鐘即又成長。（二）危險堪虞！（三）注射『阿斯凡納命』（『六〇六』），及銘劑之『尅爾梅星』（Carbisin），並行其他『驅梅療法』。（四）可治，但包治有背醫者道德，恕敝醫師不能應命。（五）二元。（六）君誤矣，『阿片』只可止痛一時，　痛　無益處。在『阿片』本是藥品，有用量，有極量，醫者用之尚須萬分謹慎。豈是病人可以隨便啓用？！君將蹈人若海不能自拔矣！</p>
<p>龜頭破皮</p>
<p>第二十四號，虹口東方恒路春陽里ＳＹ君問：敝人於一週前偶於不潔女友性交（是否不潔，余不得而知）時，不慎將　頭邊處之皮搽破二小塊，即有邊一處，及中下部一處。事後並未留心，過二日　發現。自敷外科藥「洗血鏡」（即「冷香雪」）未見效，至今已一星期矣。在邊破傷處已　微硬，中下部之傷，未見變化。但二處之傷均未收口。請問（一）此為何病症？有何特效藥否？（二）如赴貴診所醫治，包治取費幾何？何時可好？如檢騐此為何病，取費若干？（三）此病是否即俗名謂之「下疳」？（四）何謂「軟性下疳」？何謂「硬性下疳」？（五）此病有無後患？答：（一）是『軟性下疳』，『海鉍仿』（Haibi-form）可敷。（二）本診所為嘉患貧病起見，上午只收號金二角，下午一元二角，但上午以真正貧乏為限。包治有損醫家德，敝人不敢聞。放置不醫須四星期至八星期。始能痊愈。本病病狀已明，無須再檢騐，如須騐血，須待兩星期後，收費二元。（三）見（一）。（四）『軟性下疳』發生於不潔交姤之第三四日，為一種『錬鎖狀球菌傳染』；『硬性下疳』發生於交姤後之第二星期至第五星期，為『梅毒』之初期症狀。（五）普通無後患，身體衰弱之患者有成為『壤疳』之可能。</p>
<p>肛門肉塊</p>
<p>第二十五號，滙山路大連灣路，華成烟廠陳偉大君問：鄙人日前肛門口突然發現一豆粒狀肉塊，略有疼痛，尤其是每日於工作疲勞後，格外感覺不舒服。敝人過去數年會患大便不暢症，加以近來睡眠失調，想此病起因不出於此。日前已請西醫診查，據云：『是初期的痔瘡，現在除自己調養——即每日不過勞，富營養食品外，別無其他藥療法。將來如病狀厲害，只有割治一法，而眼前則割治不上算。』云云。……所以上叙某西醫所談是否完全可靠？（二）眼前不予治療，此症是否將日漸厲害？（三）除割治外，此症尚有其他可靠之藥物療法否？（四）鄙人如有時問，尚擬登門請貴醫師診療，未悉貴醫師以為由此種需要否？</p>
<p>答：（一）可靠，但新式療法「痔瘡」注射，發烟硝酸腐蝕，燒灼等。（四）某西醫診治無誤，不必挽醫。</p>
<p>鼻流泉水</p>
<p>辣婓德路永裕里三十八號俞壽芳君（第二十六號問：……鄙人有微恙，敬問先生，請先生答覆：（一）所患者與張義君（神經衰弱）相同，平日喜閱書籍（醫書除外）。以前亦未服藥（因限於經濟）。（二）鼻內非常臭，而流似濃之泉水。（三）中日頭暈眼花欲墜。身體甚虛弱而多小病。（四）不知除根「賀爾賜保命」外尚有其他辦法否。（五）診治可否？</p>
<p>答：（一）「神經衰弱」之增多，一如「近視眼」，同是一種時代病，同是一種由社會進化演出的慘劇。青年人如我輩者，不願作時代的落伍者，目的是不錯的，錯只錯在方法。請君相信，社會的經騐足以使君成一時代青年，遠勝於書本，走出大門，體騐體騐現社會。（二）鼻內流臭濃之原因頗多，不經檢查，難作定論。（三）與鼻病，腦病俱有關係。對於腦病於服「賀爾賜保命」之外可注射「神爾神」（Blusen）。（五）最好。</p>
<p>經水不調</p>
<p>南市倒川弄長壽里李慕韓君問（第二十七號）：內子已卅多歲，會生過兩個孩子，部已十多歲了。數年來天癸不調，或先或後，（最近多半總是過期）。經朝期間，即有腿酸小腹脹痛，精神倦怠，不思飲食等等的病態。察其經行血色甚淡，間有紫色小血塊。腹痛時得手緊接，則痛减稍覺舒暢。爰有下列幾項問題，敬請先生賜答，并予指示為感。（一）是否為「血虛」（？）衰弱，所謂貧血症？（二）「伯勞丸」，「衛爾母」兩種是否能治此病？（三）請指示其他更適合之藥物，得以日常服用，减除月事痛苦！（四）用何藥物能使其「脾」（？）胃健旺，食慾增進？（五）久久不愈，有何重大病體變化？</p>
<p>答：（一）但看上面所叙似非「貧血症」，而為『月經困難』，至於有否其他子宮病，沒有經過檢查的手續，是很難說的。（二）『伯勞丸』能治貧血，『衛爾母』不知何物，不敢批評。（三）用『當歸兒』（Tancno）每次半調羹，及『痛心靈』二片（Tonbelin）同時服用，可達此目的。（四）可用『阿雪多斯陪潑辛』（Aectoe-Pcpoin）。（五）檢後方知。</p>
<p>陰魔腫脹</p>
<p>第二十八號，北四川路一三三一號周旋君問：鄙人患陰囊腫脹症——左隻獨脹如雞蛋（右隻無變態）。早晨起身覺得恢復如常人一樣，但僅過數分鐘後，又成單邊大。沒有痛　現象。患已一年餘。請先生關於下列幾點，加以詳盡指導：（一）本症何名，是否疝氣？（二）有影響其他部分起變態能力否？不治是否還會再大？（三）該用何藥或何種手術？</p>
<p>答：（一）外鼠蹊疝氣。（二）能影響身體其他部分。有再脹大之可能性。（三）藥物不能醫。疝氣帶可用（輕症），重症許行手術，手術有路加霞僧內氏手術法，巴斯內氏手術法，科佛兒氏法等。</p>
<p>頭暈腦脹</p>
<p>第廿九號，北四川路餘廢坊卅八號蔣偉君問：敝人為了職務關係，每天總要在十二點或者二點至四點四點　能睡，八點鐘就須起身。這樣的生活過了足有四年。現在離開這生活已有四月，可是我已變成一個神經衰弱者。今日每天起牀後，終日頭暈腦脹，在頭搖動時，腦部『各，各，各』作響。看書稍多些的時候，腦子，就更加的糊塗－－好像發熱似的，同時眼睛亦會人倦。這病象在三年前起的，當時不過很輕。我曾服過幾種西藥，都不見效。今請求先生指答在下：（一）怎樣療法－－藥最好不要貴的藥，因敝人經濟力很薄。（二）不醫會起怎樣的變化。（三）有無危險性？（四）平日該多食那一類東西，於我病有益？（五）再全身汗癥怎樣治可　？</p>
<p>答：看了你的信，引起我無限的同情。想小小的年紀（據你信說今年只有十八歲，那麼你不是十四歲就作事了嗎？），遭受這種苦痛，實在太可憐了。　時間有這樣的資本家，只顧他個人一捲捲鈔票向保險箱裏收，向銀行裏存，不惜戕害前途有為的青年，真使人痛恨萬分。不滿你說，我幼年時代，所受經濟及人事的折磨，比你更甚，為了失學，也曾痛哭過三　夜，為了苦讀，也曾生過『神經衰弱』，而到現在還是帶着一副三百度的近視鏡。不過我的『神經衰弱』終於治好了，不過是在掙扎出來，得到出路以後，但是我的療法對你說了你一點用也沒有，那是因為機會不同（我曾棄了書本走了半個中國）。不過我替你想（一）療法你的病因去了。一切的病，原因去了以後，就很容易痊愈。你現在是『神經衰弱』，好起來雖沒有旁的病那樣快，但是我可以保你，八個月以後一定可以大大的减輕。在這恢復期中，你要注意的是不要看書，不要憂愁你的病和其他事情。藥物喫些『賀爾賜保命丸』（Piu　Ｈo-rnispermin）就夠了。你不要太相信藥，以為病非藥不能醫，現代醫學的療法多着呢。（二）不醫你永遠成為一個不能成偉大事業的人，不過，你却知道，你現在在不知不覺中正在醫他呢！（三）生命危險沒有。你的病會好，絕對會好，不要太顧慮牠！（四）你所愛喫的東西都與你的病有利益，尤其是蛋黃。（五）用些『碳酸鎂』乾撲。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>國人一致的希望</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>自民國以來，可說沒有一天是寧靜的日子，不是在內訌狀態時期，便是在外侮狀態時期，這種時期的難過，這可說是如坐針氈，如芒刺在背，實在不能安枕，不過欲避免外禍的襲擊，必須先堅壁清野，整理內部工作，這原是我人民一致的主張，也是整理國家的不二法門，無論何人，葉可否認的。</p>
<p>不科兩廣異動，假名對外，先自稱戈，幸中央當局，看準此點，决不願以武力對付，先以誠意相示，開誠布公，曉以大義，明以禍福，天然專以搜刮為政的軍閥，果然衆叛親離，不打自倒，而西南山雨欲來風滿樓的嚴重局面，不兩月而冰雪消烊，和平過去，這原是政府既定的國策，亦是人民一致的主張，抜去一種禍根，卽為國家保存一些元氣，此我國人民第一個希望。</p>
<p>陳氏既去，李白猶在，廣東雖已隸屬中央，桂省猶未能一致，中央不惜委曲求全，迭派大員，商洽合作，並聲明决不以武力對付，全以政治手腕來折衛，李白功在民國，治標一省，大義昭然，不容拗抗，天然亦得於和平談笑中，把數年來形格勢禁的局面，閣隔不通的意見，完全剷除，如是不但國家收和平統一之效，抑且得臂指相使之助，此我國人民第二個希望。</p>
<p>國家統一，再談外交，用越在京，坐商大局，其名既為成都事件，而實欲整個調整外交，整個交涉，和整個調整，固所樂聞，未識所調整者不知用何種的方式，與何種條件，在我人未能明瞭以前，原未便加以判斷，惟知此次川越大使之來，原衛有一種大使命，並非尋常使臣可比，聞日本當局對於成都事件，認為事態嚴重，故在川越大使未曾來華之前，日外陸海三相，屢次作緊急會議，商討對策，首相廣田及外相有田，並且數次觀見Ｈ皇，奏報辦理此事經過及對策，共重視此事的心裡，可見一斑。</p>
<p>其實成都　衆暴動事件，並不十分嚴重，此事究屬如何情形，尚待詳實調查，現尚未明其真相，總而言之，此事不過為成都一隅地方不安狀態的表現，而日本新聞記者，不幸於此時期，慘遭鞠凶而已，故我認為日本當局，果真欲以親　為目的，不應小題大做，借題發揮，當一秉化大事為小事，大事為無事的主張，和平靜氣，公開討論，或可收親善的真真效果，否則愈弄僵，而我國委屈求全的忍耐，亦恐已至於最後限度矣，此我國人民第三個希望。</p>
<h3>別墅里的慘劇</h3>
<p>— 以一</p>
<p>因為離開了那一所小客店的時光已經不早了，所以當車子行道開元寺的時候，我們已經被炎熱的太陽追及了，在我們的周身像是安放了幾千百個大火爐，「如果咱們要走上一天這樣的路的話，咱們就要變成乾蝦啦！」那老車一壁揮着汗，一壁這麼嚷着，不，更有一件有趣的事情發生了，就是那老車夫連褲子也脫掉了，他指着肚子以下的與其他地方發着不调合的白色的皮肉说「……喂，先生，瞧，大姑娘的肉恐怕也不及咱這麼嫩哩！」他說完了，於是我們都縱聲笑了，這笑馬上給這大野里的寂靜來吞掉了。</p>
<p>「你不怕碰見人嗎？」</p>
<p>「人？……哼，你放心吧，先生，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>不會碰見女人的，在這樣的一望無邊的坡野裏什麼樣的女人敢走呵！她們要是遇見年青的小夥子！哈哈哈哈，……那個帳就算不清了…得兒——！喔噢！……你說是不是呵！…要是咱遇見男人們，這有什麽稀罕的呢？還不是一笑算完嗎？…你若受不了熱也脫了好了，告訴你吧，先生！什麽體面到鄉下來便不值錢了－你要是穿得長衫馬褲，或什麽洋裝領帶的，說不定早發瘟病回姥姥家去了呢！」</p>
<p>馬喘息着，在邊打下慢吞吞的往前行去</p>
<p>看起來，廣闊的大地像是一個個圓圓的磨盤，雖然是我們往前走動，但我們總好似永遠靜止在這磨盤的中心，不是我們動，而是土地在打旋了。</p>
<p>「喂！過去那個山坡就是七里堡了！我所說的那個唯一的別墅就在堡的左邊」，老車夫，一面凝視着前方，一面半轉臉和我說着。</p>
<p>「你不是要講給我關於那堡里的事　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。我賣的關子了「那麼，現在你正可以講了，好嗎？」</p>
<p>「這有什麽不好呢？…」於是他咳嗽了兩聲，把馬打了兩鞭，話便這樣的開始：</p>
<p>「咳！……有綫的人事情總是多的，吃飽了，喝足了，沒事做，無聊的事情便跟着來了！</p>
<p>那個別墅的主人有五十幾歲了，我還見過他吶，很健壯的，他並沒有做過什麽官，他是靠祖上的家産才過著很舒服的日子，他每年總是要出門旅行一次，那就有一月或兩月的行程了。</p>
<p>他的太太據說是很年輕，不過二十幾歲，也有人說是他的姨太太，這我便不清楚了！總之，他們之間的感情並不怎麼好，嘖！總有點那個呵！…哈哈…！</p>
<p>大概是，…嗯，不錯，是七年前的秋天，那位紳士先生剛剛由青島避暑回來，那悲慘的事情便漸漸的演出來了。</p>
<p>原因是那位紳士先生在青島帶回來　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。不是？…哈哈，那種關係也就不用我說了！那位老紳士便天天伴着那姑娘，早把他的太太拋到九霄雲外去了！…哼！太太並不喜歡那老頭子，可是老頭子給那姑娘那樣好，這便引起了她的醋勁和忿恨。不是嗎？差不多在頭一個月裏，每天總要吵幾次架的，老紳士總是袒護着那姑娘，替她找到很多的理由來給那太太為難，有好幾次都是老紳士動手將太太來打了。</p>
<p>他們之間的裂痕是日漸其深了。</p>
<p>一天夜裏，突然的老紳士的鍾愛的姑娘死去了，遍身變成黑紫色，並且生滿了斑點，嘴裏和鼻孔裏以及其他的地方都流出了血，老紳士絕望了，他曉得致她死的是誰，等到他拿起了手槍趕到那太太的房間裏的時候，已經失掉她的踪跡了，他的神經失掉了主宰，他無目的地亂放着槍，有兩個僕人和一個女僕便在他的槍下死掉了。於是…他便隨　　　　　　　地。　　　　　　　　　．有時哈哈的　笑　　　　　　　哭嚎着，有時他說着別人所不能懂的話，跑遍了七里堡的每一個人家裏去尋找什麽！…唉！……</p>
<p>這樣的鬧了不到一個月，這可憐的老紳士也失踪了，但是沒有一星期便給人發現了，發現他死在離開七里堡不到二里地的一個泥潭裏！………。</p>
<p>「喂！…看哪！」老車夫提高了喉嚨，他指著前面隱在一帶松林後的白色的小洋房，「…那就是那別墅呵！…瞧見了嗎？先生！…」</p>
<p>我的心裏被一件什麽東西　咬着，我點了點頭！</p>
<p>「聽說，晚上還鬧鬼哩！…沒有什麽人敢在晚上從那兒經過呵！…老車夫有點虛張聲勢的說。</p>
<p>「堡里很熱鬧嗎？」我向他問了。</p>
<p>「嗯！…那還是個二等的小鎮哩，店家什麽的都有，我們到那裏可以吃午飯……噢噢！」。他把馬來停住並且哈哈的笑起來了！我問他為什麽把車停住呢　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　面笑着說：「差一點兒出了岔頭兒，要是光著屁股進了堡，不給人家揍爛了才怪了呢！…</p>
<p>於是他穿上了褲子。</p>
<h3>老毛子街</h3>
<p>— 蘿澎</p>
<p>清晨，推開窗戶，一陣涼風　來，使我不禁打了幾個寒噤，我才意識到秋是來到人間了。天是陰暗的。窗外幾棵桑子樹上的樹葉，前幾天還是濃綠得發黃色，捲縮着，一張一張地開始從它的樹枝上落下來，在天空，在地下，飄蘯着，滾動着，仿佛風車似的。</p>
<p>我伏在床欄上，抽起了烟捲，凝视着窗外那空大的廣場，堆滿了細石碎瓦：錢幾天這兒是有着歪斜的小屋，可是在昨天已經被强迫拆去了。遠處也有着幾間同樣的破落的小屋，零散地蹲在幾座高樓大廈的旁邊，想着它們未來的命運，我感到淒涼。</p>
<p>不知在什麽時候，窗外落起細細的小雨來了，細得像蜘蛛網。它雖然沒有暴雨那樣的雄壯，可是它的力量却也不小：一會兒廣場上滿地都成了爛泥，低落的地方還　上了水，幾條在牆邊　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。這時，它們疲乏地蹲在牆邊，把腦袋放在地下，一動也不動，睜著一對大而悲涼的眼睛，雨水從他們的腦袋上緩緩地淋下來，像是在落淚。廣場的一角，更有幾隻小狗淒涼的悲涼着，斷斷續續地；仿佛和尚道士在深夜中吹着招人的號角。</p>
<p>街燈明亮了，細雨落得更密，肚皮有點餓。我不知道我這一天是怎樣地捱過的。突然我記起了老毛子　；每天上飯館去時，都要經過那兒，我想這時那些流落異國的白俄，該不知怎樣了，有些或許是躲到人家的屋簷下去，或者是喝飽了老酒，麻木地倒在稀爛的泥土中，或者像一條野狗似的　　在街頭。</p>
<p>穿過了窗外的廣場，就抗日到了老毛子街。其實那兒是一條陰暗狹窄的小巷，男男女女的白俄成　的集在那兒；巡捕老爺們是不常光臨的。所以那些店鋪裏的茶房小夥計們，都稱這條小巷為老毛子街了。</p>
<p>我沒有打雨傘，也不穿雨衣，急急地跑到了那兒。我站在老毛子街的街口。街燈下站着一個白俄女人，暗淡的燈兒照在她蒼白的面孔，她那瘦長的身體裏面一件空　的破大衣中，我認識她，這女人每晚都要向我要一根香烟。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>「哈囉！」她又走近我身邊來了：「Cigarettes」她說。用食指動了一動，我便趕忙地給她一根香烟。她點燃了香烟，又走到她原來站着的地位去了。</p>
<p>每晚，我給了她一根烟捲後，便顫慄着身體走開了，我不敢多望她一眼。今晚，我鼓着勇氣站在那兒。</p>
<p>瞧！她將一根烟屁股頭扔到地下去了，隨接便急急地向我身邊跑來，亂踏着泥土，泥水濺到我的臉上來；我慌了，我恨不得返身就跑。但却出乎我的意外，那女人經過我的身邊，抱起了蹲在街口的牆邊下的一隻小狗塞懷中，向着耄子街的那頭走去了。</p>
<p>走不了幾步，她回過腦袋來對我望了一眼，閉起一雙眼睛笑着，是那樣淫蕩地笑呵！我不去理她，我依舊站在那兒。她大概感到失望了，便在她身邊的牆角下一羣男女白俄的身邊坐下來。他們輪流地抽着烟捲，都沉默着說不出一句話。讓雨水淋着他們的身體。</p>
<p>我的肚子餓得「碰咚，碰咚」地響，雨水從我的腦袋上流下來，它隨着凉風拂着我的面孔，使人有點受不了。但是內心不知是感到悲哀，抑是憤怒？站在那兒，我有着一個長久的時間說不出話來。</p>
<h3>老洋客</h3>
<p>— 林納</p>
<p>從納卯開來十點三十分列車的二等車箱里，老洋客陳金遂提着一隻手提箱，匆匆忙忙的擠出了月台。他像一匹公猪一樣的肥胖豐碩，走起路來時時發着喘，出了月台，他便放下了手中的提箱，掏出汗中把面上的汗水揩抹着，又遠遠地像一隻馬車招着手。馬車夫機警地揚着手中的長鞭兒，吆喝着便把車子趕了過來。</p>
<p>「巴石路七十四號」老洋客跳了上去，生氣似的呌着。</p>
<p>馬車夫溫順地點着頭，嘴裏輕輕的鳴嘯着，鞭兒在空中揚着，打了一個迴旋，又悄然的失落在瘦削的馬背上，馬車接着於是也蠕蠕的動了。他厭惡地向四周看着，便又沉沒在他不安的深思裏了。三天前，在納卯他得了一個在岷里拉朋友的信，說到他留學在岷里拉女兒底事，才趕着來，現在他底心裏就非常愁悶，不斷對自己喃喃的說着：</p>
<p>「怪不得有了三個假期都推說在忙着預備功課不回納卯去」。想了一會，他又「那麼我要怎樣告訴她呢？我要把我所知道的全告訴了她，接下就生氣地責問着她道：你以為瞞得過我嗎？對這丟面的現你還有第二句話嗎？為什麼我要送你上岷里拉來進大學，你是明白，為的是華僑界的榮譽，陳家的榮譽，現在你已把陳家和全華僑界都辱沒了，你有話說嗎？沒有，好跟上納卯去。……」</p>
<p>他笑着，對於自己的安排定了的話，感到了非常滿意。過去一天一夜底旅程，他就全為思索了這幾句話　偷偷溜走了，他相信着自己底成功。</p>
<p>「那時她會怎樣呢？」接着他想道：「一定的，她會跑在我底面前，兩眼汪着淚，低聲的抽泣着道：—我我……年輕不懂事，爸原諒我吧！……而我？我將要氣促地嘆息着道：——我要原諒你，原諒你，孩子……」</p>
<p>車子急速地　蹶起來了，轉過了一條街　去，便又平平靜靜的走着，太陽乏神地在滾熱的柏油路道上懶懶的　着。馬掌鐵敲打在路上，便發出了陣陣輕脆的響聲，這響聲在寂寞的街上震顫着，後一會便在熱悶的天空裏消失了！</p>
<p>忽然，一陣思想很尖銳的刺進他的腦子里去！「如果她反抗着呢？」他非常吃驚，好像是一個囚徒突然發現了他必須立刻被執行槍决那樣：「那麼，我就要執行法律付給我底權利了，我要控上大理院，控那個在大學里讀書，死追着她的小夥子，我要用正義說服她：你想一想，一個高貴的中國女人和這野蠻的，沒開化的土人結婚，這不會是辱沒了全華僑界嗎？這不會辱沒了我們陳家的光榮嗎？為着我們底光榮打算，也為着你以後的出路打算，放棄他吧，丟棄他吧，我們中國人有的是有綫子弟和財富貴人這樣一來，她底心不會動嗎？會的，她就轉機了，……」</p>
<p>馬車沿着一條靜寞的街道走着，馬車夫就沒停的溜着兩隻黑金的眼睛，向兩旁放在那惹目的門牌號碼注視着，嘴里就不斷喃喃的唸道：「二十四，二十六，二十八……」</p>
<p>終於，他把馬韁頭曳得緊緊的，馬兒就驚慌地昂起頭來，疊着前蹄，一會便把脚步歇止，沮喪地乘着汗淋淋的頭，馬車夫於是便回過頭來向他微微的笑着到：「先生七十四號到了！」</p>
<p>老洋客伸出了頭來向四周看着，在他面前千元立着是一排齊整的小洋房子，藍底白字的七十四號牌子，惹目地向他微笑着。他把車資付了便跳下來跨着進去。在會客室里有一個差役打扮的人迎着他，他把要找的人底姓告訴了，便被帶着上樓去。</p>
<p>在一間寫著某字的房間，他輕輕的伸出手去敲着，有一個未酉亞女人出來替他開了，隨着迎面向他洋溢過來了一陣清亮的鋼發聲，他稍微感到不快的跨進去。這是一間裝簧得相當嚴整的房子，那塗在壁上的花紙和掛在窗前的幕帷有點使他目眩，在一架鋼琴前坐着一個著睡服的女子，她正在彈着一支合唱曲，離她不遠底沙發椅上便坐着一位面孔黝黑的年輕紳士，有一個周歲左右的胖肥孩子就坐在他底懷里呀呀的呌着，揚着兩隻小手。</p>
<p>老洋客有點吃驚，他兀然的把脚步</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，自己是跑錯了，然而，很快他把這猜疑放棄了，那個正在彈著琴的女子已經站立起來而且面對著他，露著畏縮而又不安的神色，低低的用英語向他　著：「爸爸……」</p>
<p>坐在沙發上的那個紳士也抱了孩子兀然的站起來，他有點惶惑，可是面上仍露著矜持的微笑。</p>
<p>沒等她來得及介紹，他什麼都明白了，他沒有氣恨也沒有絕望，排在他面前的是鐵般堅持已成的事實，他還有什麼　　　，他能說什麼話呢？只悄悄的向　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>「你們什麼都做得好，不要疑心，孩子，我是特地來看你們的……」</p>
<p>他底淚珠盈溢著，滴落了。</p>
<h3>平凡的瑣事</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>我底芳憐冼伯清失業了。——那是因為那家膠廠倒閉的緣故。</p>
<p>巫婆兼專做媒人的許二姑為他向西侯王菩蕯去祈願。</p>
<p>「西侯王是靈騐的。我底半世人都是王爺賜的福。高佬陳德輝底大兒子和　隻佬阿譚，不是祈了願大約個把星期　　　　　　　　　　麼　　　　　姑底　　　　　　　　　　如此　　　對冼　　　　　　」</p>
<p>而結果是有趣得很的：那失業的膠鞋廠工人底眉頭鎖得理緊了些；許二姑卻彷佛贏了幾場「五百　」似的快樂著。</p>
<p>在一個落著微雨的秋夜，我底芳憐帶了他底家小終於　著眉頭回鄉去了。……</p>
<p>大約是他們走後的三個星期，那工人住進的房間底主人就換了一對年青的夫妻。但，據他們本人自認是還未曾結過婚的。</p>
<p>男的是小學教員，有一張小風琴，靜寂的黃昏里，風琴底嗚咽常常伴和著一個蒼老而憂　的低嗓音——</p>
<p>「你知道生命有多長！</p>
<p>你還年青呀，</p>
<p>怎麼老垂柳般的掛下臉孔呢！</p>
<p>給我瞧：你底</p>
<p>眼珠子不是充滿了生底活潑麼！</p>
<p>就這樣，活下去吧·」　（未完）</p>

<h3>關於「祖國」中國譯本之演出</h3>
<p>今日唐槐秋先生領導中國旅行劇團在卡爾合影院首次出演維克多利燕蕯爾都（Victorien　Sardon）原著之五幕歷史劇「祖國」（Patrie），本劇會於上星期一試演成功，已誌本報。</p>
<p>我們本人雖不能絕對領略陳綿先生譯文之美善，但一切都使我們相信儈他的譯文是很好的，因為陳綿先生不僅是我國的國家博士，（這個學位已經是一個有價值的保證，值得我們尊重。）而且是一個文學家同實行者。他作過「熙德」的譯文，能通中法兩國文字的學者們都交口稱讚，假使他能戰勝繙譯這樣淵詩文的困難，那末繙譯這本散文的「祖國」，對於他是比較容易多了。</p>
<p>陳綿先生勞　是他不僅以僅把法國戲劇的譯文供獻給他們的文學家為滿足，而還努力地想把這些戲劇實現在中國的舞台上，他很精明地寫作希望戲中的人物或悲或喜地活動在大眾的面前。</p>
<p>他在唐槐秋先生的身上找到了一個得意的合作者，他們兩人相得益彰，陳綿先生選擇劇本繙譯了，而唐槐秋先生把他們演出。</p>
<p>選擇劇本是一個很困難而微妙的工作，一個悲劇或是喜劇，不能因為在本國是一個傑作就能夠受中國觀眾的歡迎，中國戲劇與法國或歐洲戲劇上有著一道滐溝。</p>
<p>當陳綿先生譯「昂朶馬格」的時候，深知他不能希望道個譯本的演出，中國的肉與歐洲古史的距離太遠，所以對於以此為題材的戲很難發生興趣，雖然拉辛把古文曾經改新了一番。再說在此劇中拉辛對於心理微妙的描寫，要使遠東人真正地傾賞必須有一番努力，而這個努力也只有特殊階級的人士才能做到。（未完）</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender system, issuance reserves have been fully centralized. Banknotes issued by various banks no longer need to be restricted to specific regions, and can circulate freely, which is extremely convenient. However, as a result, the types and forms of banknotes circulating in the market have become increasingly complex. Smaller merchants often find it difficult to distinguish the authenticity of banknotes from other regions due to their unfamiliarity and fear of incurring unwarranted losses, and refuse to use them. Such a situation cannot be ignored. Therefore, I would like to briefly discuss some of my observations on the issue of old banknote consolidation.</p>
<p>(1) For banknotes from other regions circulating in the local market, issuing banks should notify exchange businesses to accept them at the exchange rate without refusal. Even if there are special circumstances that require restrictions, preventive measures should be taken at the source. As for the currently issued banknotes, the colors and patterns often change frequently, making it difficult for users to recognize them clearly and easier for counterfeit banknotes to be mixed in. I believe that recalling old banknotes and issuing new ones is convenient for identification. While it is permissible to change the patterns, the forms of newly issued banknotes of the same value should generally not be changed frequently.</p>
<p>(2) Banknote issuance in our country has always been very scattered. Now that issuance has been centralized, the old banknotes of various banks that have stopped issuing should be recalled as soon as possible. It is said that two-thirds have been recalled in the past ten months, with only 73 to 74 million yuan remaining in circulation on the market. Therefore, banknotes such as those from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank are rarely seen on the market. However, banknotes from the Tongshang, Siming, and China Industrial Banks are still commonly seen. It is hoped that they can also be fully recalled within a short period of time so that the circulating banknotes can be unified.</p>
<p>(3) Banks have restrictions on the use of worn and damaged banknotes, but most people are unaware of this. As a result, intermediaries are able to manipulate the situation, and users feel inconvenienced. Such worn and damaged banknotes should be redeemed by the issuing banks at any time, regardless of the face value. The returned banknotes should be carefully inspected and worn banknotes removed. The methods for using worn and damaged banknotes should be prominently published in various newspapers so that the public knows how to choose.</p>
<p>(4) Most banknotes are made in foreign countries, with the United States being the most common. On average, the printing cost of each five-yuan and ten-yuan banknote is 7 jiao in national currency, the printing cost of a one-yuan banknote is more than 2 jiao, and the printing cost of a jiao banknote is more than 4 fen. Since the implementation of the legal tender system, banknotes have been used entirely, and the demand has increased. The printing cost alone is a considerable amount that is leaked abroad annually. It is recently heard that the financial authorities are preparing to print banknotes domestically, which is a very important move. It is hoped that it will be realized soon.</p>
<p>(5) The smaller the face value of the banknote, the greater the demand, the more frequent the circulation, and the easier it is to be damaged. Since the printing cost of a one-yuan banknote is more than 2 jiao, compared with minting a one-yuan coin, what is more cost-effective in terms of minting cost and wear and tear loss? This is worth studying. Since the promotion of new subsidiary coins, jiao banknotes have become rare on the market. If one-yuan coins are more durable in use and less wasteful in consumption than one-yuan banknotes, then the Finance Minister has long declared that five-jiao and one-yuan coins should be minted. Wouldn't it be better to mint them sooner?</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State's Statement: Respect Treaty Obligations, Never Recognize Manchukuo</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull delivered a speech in New York on the evening of the 15th of this month, advocating the Good Neighbor Policy and proposing that countries conclude new security pacts to replace broken treaties. Some people interpreted Hull's speech as implying that the U.S. government seemed to intend to recognize the pseudo-organization of Manchuria and recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. Hull issued a statement denying this misinterpretation, saying that violations of treaties have emerged frequently in recent years, so the U.S.'s belief in various international agreements will inevitably be reduced. However, the U.S. government will never abandon the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Former Secretary of State Stimson issued a declaration in 1932 refusing to recognize facts created by military aggression, which was based on the Non-Aggression Pact. The U.S. does not recognize the pseudo-state, nor does it recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. This Stimson Doctrine is the basis for this, and the U.S. government has no reason to abandon it.

<h3>U.S. Restores European Fleet to Promote Neutrality Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials solemnly declared today that the purpose of the U.S. restoring the European Fleet is entirely to promote the U.S.'s neutrality policy.

Secretary of State Hull announced that the government does not want to continue to provide free board and lodging to American expatriates staying at the U.S. Embassy in Spain. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Ventrin has now been ordered to end the accommodation of American expatriates and to advise the 33 American expatriates staying in the embassy to leave Spain quickly and return to their former residences.

<h3>Premier Blum Announces France's Foreign Policy: Equal Rights, Shared Peace, Seeking Understanding Regardless of Political System, Aimed at Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>(Paris) Premier Blum delivered a radio broadcast speech at 7:30 PM tonight, explaining France's foreign policy and responding to the speech delivered by German leader Hitler at the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress the other day. As the League of Nations General Assembly is about to open and the preparatory negotiations for the London Five-Power Conference are underway, the Premier's speech is of great importance to the international situation. Excerpts are as follows. The general idea of Blum's speech is: "France has never wanted to force any country to adopt any political system, even the political system that France considers the wisest and fairest. France does not want to force others to adopt it because France has always respected the sovereignty of other countries, which is exactly the same as the idea that France's sovereignty should be respected. France opposes international propaganda policies and opposes the cycle of war and revenge. What France wants is nothing else than for all countries in the world, regardless of what political system they adopt domestically, to live in peace with each other. France wants to find ways to eliminate all conflicts that could lead to war. France has never refused to participate in any international negotiations. In short, a democratic government internally respects the concept of humanity, and externally respects the concept of peace. What we French call peace means that countries, regardless of their size, should enjoy equal rights between countries.</p>
<p>"The goal of peace lies in seeking coordination, understanding, and cooperation between countries. The French government's every word and deed externally follows this path. This is what we dare to declare to the world on behalf of the French people. Moreover, the concept of peace is not only a logical result of the democratic spirit, but also the most practical proposition. History shows us that true and lasting peace cannot be found in selfishness and injustice. Furthermore, any armed conflict in modern Europe cannot limit its scope and make it localized. A single spark can start a prairie fire. Since war has a universal nature, peace must also be universal," he said.</p>
<p>At this point, Blum responded to Hitler's point in his speech at the Nuremberg Congress, who believed that democratic politics could not be stable and lasting, saying, "According to the history of the 19th century, democratic politics should at least be as permanent as politics based on individual power. Politics based on individual power, no matter how great a genius this individual is, his rule may not be more permanent than democratic politics. Moreover, internal opinions in France are inevitably divergent, and the views of various parties in France are also opposed to each other. We do not deny this, but all French people, regardless of which party they belong to, unanimously desire peace, and when necessary, they will all unite to defend their country. The past facts are like this, and the present is still the same," (Havas telegram, 17th).</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Criticism</h3>
<p>The National Socialist Party's organ newspaper "National Daily" in Essen, Germany, recently commented on the speech delivered by the French Prime Minister yesterday, saying, "Premier Blum issued it with the demeanor of a true theorist and with cautious words. Unfortunately, this speech only speaks of peace and does not provide much benefit for solving major diplomatic issues, especially the mutual compromise between Germany and France," (Havas telegram, 18th).</p>
<h3>The British Government Sends Out a Note, Convening a Five-Power Conference, Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to European Problems, The Situation of the Russian-German Estrangement Is Difficult to Be Optimistic</h3>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office has decided today to deliver a note regarding the Locarno Five-Power Conference to the ambassadors of France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany in the UK, and forward it to their respective governments. The content of this note should be based on the communique issued after the London Conference of the three countries of Britain, France, and Belgium on July 23 of this year (according to the conclusion of the communique, there are five points: (1) A general solution must be sought for European problems; (2) The countries concerned should cooperate freely and avoid being divided into groups that confront each other; (3) Convene a conference of the five countries participating in the Locarno Treaty to discuss a new treaty to replace the Locarno Treaty; (4) Negotiate with Italy and Germany by Britain, France, and Belgium to promote the Five-Power Conference; (5) If the Five-Power Conference makes progress, convene other countries concerned to participate together to solve the general peace problem in Europe). According to the UK, in May of this year, it submitted a list of eleven questions to Germany, but it has not yet received a response from Germany. Now it plans to use other methods to inquire about Germany's opinions. Government officials believe that this note is the final attempt by the British government, the purpose of which is to make Germany change its stance and discuss the issue of Western European security and the Eastern European agreement together with the Soviet Union. However, the general public believes that the situation is very bleak, because Germany's attitude towards the Soviet Union recently has little hope of changing, and Germany's attitude towards the establishment of a Western European convention has also become increasingly cold, because Germany obviously wants to maintain freedom of action (Havas telegram, 18th).</p>

<p>According to officials here in the capital of Hungary, the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary are scheduled to hold a meeting in Vienna in the near future.

Delbos is scheduled to visit Chilean Ambassador to Italy Victorina, the chairman of this session of the Administrative Council, this afternoon.

<h3>Alcazar Castle is Bombed and Destroyed, The Most Tragic Scene in the Spanish Civil War, The Rebel Army is Surrounded and Dies Without Surrendering, Important Strategic Location</h3>
<p>Andaya Alcazar Castle, which had been defended by a small number of rebels for seven weeks, was blown up by government troops today with a landmine under the castle, causing the castle to be almost completely destroyed. Before the government troops detonated the landmine, they ordered all the civilians in the town of Toledo to move to a place one and a half miles away from the town at night to avoid being affected. These people all lived in tents in the strong wind (Reuters telegram, 18th).</p>
<p>Andaya A column of rebel troops who went to the rescue fought hard at night, but are still 14 miles away from Alcazar. The famous Moroccan-style castle in the area has been completely destroyed. The 1,000 rebels in the besieged castle, including 600 women and children, are still determined not to surrender and await the arrival of death. The bombing of Alcazar Castle can be regarded as the most tragic scene in the Spanish Civil War. On the rebel side, the fall of this castle has a greater impact than the occupation of Oviedo or Huesca by government troops. From a military perspective, the importance of this castle is because the location of Alcazar can control the avenue to Madrid and the railway from Alicante to Valencia. Whoever can control the Toledo area, the main port will fall into whose hands. This is a major element in the defense of Madrid, because the food in the area is completely imported through this road (Reuters telegram, 18th).</p>
<p>Madrid After the government troops bombed Alcazar Castle at 6:15 AM this morning, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the rebels in the tile yard (National Telegram, 17th).</p>
<p>Andaya Since the besieged rebels who defended the historically famous Moroccan-style castle Alcazar of Toledo refused to surrender, the government troops are now continuing their offensive and carrying out landmine work. It is heard that a large number of landmines have been transported to the center of Alcazar through the dug tunnels, and they may be detonated at any time. According to reports from the rebel side, the mountain town of Ronda and the fortress in the Malaga area have been occupied by the revolutionary army, but well-informed sources in La Rina do not believe this news. According to travelers who recently went to Malaga, the city will not fall for a while. The government troops are in a difficult situation due to the lack of bullets and gasoline, but it is heard that a large number of weapons and bullets transported from Mexico will arrive in Malaga today. The rebels also claimed that the revolutionary army killed 3,000 government troops in the Toledo area in the past few days, and claimed that the revolutionary army also won major victories in the Guadarrama and Zimosira areas (Reuters telegram, 18th).</p>
<p>Seville The radio station of the National Army here recently broadcasted a message saying that the National Army launched an attack on the Darafanla front line south of Beijing yesterday, killing more than 1,000 Marxist Party troops. General Asensio, the commander of the government troops there, was almost captured alive. Madrid Cabinet Prime Minister Caballero asked the Barcelona authorities for help because the city of Toledo south of Beijing is a military-industrial production base and is now threatened by the National Army, and requested that they send fresh troops to transport military supplies to Beijing for use. In addition, the Madrid Civil Corps is digging trenches on the streets (Havas telegram, 18th).</p>

The purpose of the enactment of this statute is twofold: first, to encourage shipbuilding to demonstrate promotion; and second, to strive for control in order to avoid abuses. There are eight key points: (1) Shipyards will not be rewarded; only shipowners will be rewarded. (2) Engines are all purchased from foreign countries and cannot be manufactured domestically for the time being, so they will not be rewarded for now. (3) The ships that currently sail the most along the Yangtze River and the coast generally range from 500 to 3,000 tons, and 80% of them are foreign-flagged. In order to recover rights and interests, it is necessary to actively encourage shipbuilding, so a five-tier reward standard is specifically stipulated: 12 yuan per ton for ships of 500 tons or more but less than 1,000 tons; 16 yuan per ton for ships of 1,000 tons or more but less than 2,000 tons; 20 yuan per ton for ships of 2,000 tons or more but less than 3,000 tons; 24 yuan per ton for ships of 3,000 tons or more but less than 5,000 tons; and 28 yuan per ton for ships of 5,000 tons or more. (4) Ships under 500 tons mostly operate on inland rivers and are less important, so they are not included in the rewards. (5) Ships are of great importance to military transport, so the statute specifies that the Ministry of Navy should be consulted for review and approval. (6) Because higher speeds require greater effort and expense, which is not economical, and because the wharves along the Yangtze River and the coast are often very narrow and subject to tidal restrictions, speed will not be rewarded for the time being. (7) For those who build new ships and demolish old ships, rewards will also be given for demolishing old ships to promote the improvement of ships and prevent them from being purchased by foreigners. (8) The amount of the reward for building a new ship is approximately 6-7% of the cost. If an old ship is demolished at the same time, the bonus received can account for 12% of the cost of the new ship. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan Plans to Build New Site</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Sun [Fo] stated that the construction of a new site for the Legislative Yuan in the central political district has been approved by the National Government, which has allocated more than 400,000 yuan for construction expenses. A New Site Construction Committee has now been formed, consisting of Liang Han Cao, Wu Jingxiong, Fu Bingchang, Ma Yinchu, Wu Shangying, and He Sui, to be responsible for actively carrying out the project. Liang invited the members on the 18th to discuss and solicit plans for the new site. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Drafting Process of the Baojia Statute</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the review of the Baojia Statute at the Legislative Yuan on the 18th, many members raised objections. As a result, the text of the draft was revised and passed. It consists of forty-two articles. Huang Youchang reported in detail on the drafting process of the case, stating briefly that Articles 1 to 9 stipulate the organization of Baojia and the census; Articles 10 to 20 stipulate the personnel of Baojia and their tasks; Articles 21 and 22 stipulate the matters that should be stipulated in the Baojia rules and, when necessary, the joint guarantee and joint liability pledge; Articles 23 to 29 stipulate the training, organization, and exemptions of the militia; Articles 30 to 32 stipulate the Baojia expenses; Articles 33 to 38 stipulate penalties and commendations; and Articles 39 to 42 stipulate the incidental matters arising from this statute. In summary, there are six key points: (1) The Baojia Statute is generated from Article 74 of the County Autonomy Law. Previously, Baojia and autonomy were completely integrated. Therefore, the organization below the township level in counties and below the district level in cities will be changed from neighborhoods to Baojia in order to achieve uniformity. However, the implementation of affairs arising from the organization of Baojia in cities and counties is inherently difficult to unify, and there seems to be no need to force uniformity. Therefore, following the example of Article 111 of the draft constitution, when cities need to organize Baojia, the provisions of this statute may be applied mutatis mutandis. (2) According to the County Autonomy Law, the township is a level below the county, and there has been no change due to the implementation of the Baojia system. It has no impact on the use of the four rights of the people in handling autonomous affairs and training the people. Before the completion of autonomy, according to the current facts, the Jia head is publicly elected by the heads of households in the Jia, and the Bao head is publicly elected by the Jia heads in the Bao. When autonomy has achieved considerable results and the people have been trained to use the four rights, the Baojia head will be elected by the citizens in the Baojia under the jurisdiction of the township head, which is still consistent with the principle of citizen-based autonomy. As for the organization method based on households, it is stipulated based on the fifth theory of nationalism and the patriarchal system in the family law of the Civil Code. It will not change due to the different stages of supporting autonomy, starting autonomy, and completing autonomy. (3) Conducting a census is one of the six methods for starting to implement local autonomy and is also the main task of the current Baojia system. Therefore, there are regulations for conducting a census first when organizing Baojia. (4) The revision of militia training to civil training, as well as the regulations on training subjects and teaching materials, are based on the principles of implementing civil training recently passed by the Central and Local Autonomy Planning Committee. (5) The joint guarantee and joint liability pledge are limited to being carried out only when necessary. The Bao head should strive to reduce the fines for residents in the Bao, and the security team should be abolished in stages. All of this is aimed at achieving autonomy and self-defense and adjusting in practice and implementing in theory, so as to be beneficial to practical use and facilitate the promotion of autonomy. Therefore, the nature of the Baojia Statute produced by the Autonomy Law is slightly different from that of the Baojia Statute for organizing and checking households produced in the bandit suppression area. (6) The implementation rules of this statute are formulated by the provincial governments with reference to local conditions, indicating that they are flexible and provide general regulations. The County Defense Corps Law has been abolished in accordance with the principles of the central and local autonomy laws and regulations. When the city needs to organize Baojia, the county regulations shall apply mutatis mutandis, and there is no need to draft another set of regulations. Previous accumulated cases such as the revised County and City Defense Corps Law should be revoked. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office Temporarily Does Not Collect Inspection Fees; Li Qingxuan Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Hong'en, Director of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office, notified various agencies on the 18th, stating that he has taken office. The office will not charge fees for inspecting goods for the time being, only register them first. The Ronin Trade Association and smuggling shops will be responsible for allowing the goods to be transported and sold first, and the fees will be collected later after the fee rates are determined. On the 18th, Li Qingxuan again visited Xu Liya, Sun Weidong, Wang Hong'en, Guo Zhihan, and Qin Dechun to discuss the cooperation of Hebei-Chahar in suppressing smuggling and the collection of inspection fees by the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office. Opinions are gradually becoming consistent. In order to avoid hindering the collection of customs duties, the inspection fee for smuggled goods will be collected at the highest rate. Li will return south to report after the negotiations in Tianjin are completed. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Representative Song's representative Li Shijun returned from Jibei after passing through Jinan and said that Finance Minister Kong [Xiangxi] is very understanding about the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) In recent days, a large number of smuggled goods have been transported from Tianjin to Jinan by car. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In a written statement issued on the 18th, Qingxuan stated that he came north last month to meet Song and discussed the situation in the Tianjin market. He had previously instructed [me] to return to Minister Kong to present his opinions. After research by the competent department, he returned with [these opinions] to discuss [them]. He visited Song on the 17th and reported on the progress. On the original proposed method, [Song] still instructed [him] to study it in detail with the relevant personnel in order to seek a suitable way to maintain the interests of Chinese and foreign merchants and enable the economy of North China to become active day by day. It is not exclusively for the problem of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office. This office was reorganized from the Cangzhou Salt and Coast Defense Inspection Office and has been established for a long time to inspect bandits, drugs, and military supplies and to assist in suppressing smuggling. It was not established for the purpose of collecting consumption taxes. Now the truth has been clarified, and there is no need for further research. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Discusses Recent Financial and Diplomatic Situation; Advantages of Income Tax Are Equal Burden; Financial and Monetary Conditions in Guangdong and Guangxi Can Gradually Get on the Right Track; Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Negotiations Based on Equality and Mutual Benefit</h3>
<p>Vice President of the Executive Yuan Kong visited Zhang Qun at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 p.m. on the 18th to discuss matters. He took a car to Shanghai at 5:00 p.m. Since President Jiang [Jieshi] personally took charge in Guangdong to handle the Guangdong-Guangxi incident, Kong has been acting on behalf of the President of the Executive Yuan for two months. Reporters, concerned about the recent progress in finance and diplomacy, which has attracted general attention, visited the Executive Yuan before Kong's departure to Shanghai, and he kindly issued the following statement. The reporter first asked about the income tax issue. Kong said, "Our country's tax system has always focused on indirect taxes, and the unequal burden has long been criticized by scholars. The decision to implement income tax and inheritance tax is truly a new era in the history of our country's tax system. The Inheritance Tax Law is currently being drafted, and the Income Tax Law will be implemented next month. There are many advantages to income tax. The most important is the equal burden. Indirect taxes do not distinguish between rich and poor, and everyone pays taxes equally. There is even the strange phenomenon that the poor pay more and the rich pay less. Income tax is not only consistent with morality, law, and human sentiment, but also a scientific and modern tax system, which is fully in line with the principle of controlling capital in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. In addition, income tax is also related to the completion of the legal tender policy. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy last year, it has been effective. However, in order to maximize its benefits, fiscal revenue and expenditure must be balanced. The method of balancing revenue and expenditure is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Implementing income tax is the best way to increase revenue. In recent times, European and American countries have all used income tax as a major source of national treasury revenue, which is clear evidence. Therefore, implementing income tax can improve the tax system, reduce the burden on the poor, enrich the national treasury, and increase the credit of legal tender. It has a significant relationship with finance and monetary affairs. The collection procedures will also adopt simple methods. Observing that the national patriotic concepts of the people have been increasing in recent years, there should be no need to worry about boring tax evasion behaviors in the future. As for foreign residents in China, they have long been accustomed to paying income tax and enjoy all kinds of rights in our country. Based on the principle of balancing rights and obligations, they should be able to assess the situation, weigh the pros and cons, and accept this legal and reasonable income tax." The reporter asked about the financial and monetary reorganization situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. Kong said that he has always attached great importance to the finances of Guangdong and Guangxi and had conducted investigations early on. Since the promulgation of the Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Finance in Guangdong, the currency system, exchange rates, and prices in Guangdong Province have tended to stabilize, and finance has gradually become active. Guangdong is a place where overseas Chinese capital is concentrated. From now on, remittances from overseas Chinese will come in steadily, and the development of industry and commerce can be expected soon. Guangxi has always been known as barren. Over the years, Li [Zongren], Bai [Chongxi], and others have painstakingly managed it, and finance has a considerable foundation. Now that it has been unified, the financial and monetary conditions can gradually get on the right track, and there should be no problem. The decision to properly solve the financial and monetary problems in Guangdong and Guangxi is half the fortune of the people of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the country's entire finance and monetary affairs will also benefit from it. The reporter then talked about central finance. Kong said that he has been in charge of finance for three years and has lived in hardship every day. Fortunately, with the guidance of the President and the cooperation and hard work of central and local officials and people, he has managed to cope. This year, God blesses China. After the unification of the national government orders, the harvest is abundant, and the disaster is spared. The future of finance and monetary affairs will be easier to deal with than before. We should still maintain the spirit of hard work in the past, not be arrogant or indulgent, and continue to work hard. Later, the reporter talked about the establishment of an inspection office in Hebei-Chahar. The reporter said that since the customs has been earnestly suppressing smuggling, smuggling merchants have gradually disappeared. The sudden rumor that Hebei-Chahar will set up an office to collect taxes will inevitably revive the smuggling trend. What is the purpose of this, and what should be done to cope with it? Kong said that Tianjin is an area where goods converge. There are indeed a considerable number of unscrupulous merchants colluding with Ronin to smuggle goods. There are also many ignorant merchants who temporarily seek private gain, do not understand the interests of the country, and purchase and hoard smuggled goods. The Hebei-Chahar authorities' efforts to provide relief are indeed intended to sympathize with ignorant merchants, and their intention is commendable. The Ministry of Finance has now sent personnel to Ping [Beiping] to discuss everything. As long as the prestige of the government's laws and regulations can be preserved, and the customs administration, commercial treaties, and the interests of legitimate chambers of commerce across the country are not affected, temporary relief measures can be properly drafted. The central government will not disagree. The Hebei-Chahar authorities are no less patriotic than others and will not lightly believe in a few small and biased petitions, resulting in the loss of their original intention. Finally, the reporter asked about the progress of Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. Kong said that China and Japan are brotherly countries and should have been on good terms with each other and jointly maintain peace in East Asia. Unfortunately, various disputes in the past have deviated from this purpose. For several years, both sides have been in trouble. Recently, the authorities of both countries have clearly expressed their willingness to seek adjustments in Sino-Japanese relations so that the diplomacy between the two countries can be put on the right track. Unexpectedly, just as the negotiations were about to begin, the Chengdu and Beihai tragedies occurred one after another, injuring innocent people. We deeply regret this. Ambassador Kawagoe [Shigeru] to China came to Beijing to discuss this incident and general Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues. The competent authorities should follow the central government's intention, be friendly, open, and frank, and negotiate candidly. It is hoped that the Japanese side can also uphold the position of maintaining peace in East Asia and jointly seek adjustments to all issues between China and Japan on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The future of both countries depends deeply on this. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Tonight, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek departed from the Whampoa Military Academy and boarded a ferry to land in the British Concession of Shamian.

At the Shamian wharf, an Indian honor guard paid respects, and British police officers in frock coats and representatives from the British Consulate greeted him. After Chiang landed, he was escorted to the British Consulate in accordance with etiquette.

<h3>Xi'an Municipal Newspaper Association Requests Remedial Election for Journalists; Telegram Sent to Central Government Seeking Prompt Measures</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) The Xi'an Municipal Newspaper Association, on the grounds that the Xi'an press community was unable to participate in the National Election, sent telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the General Office of the National Assembly Election, requesting prompt remedial measures. The original telegram reads: To the Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and the General Office of the National Assembly Election, Your Excellencies: The convening of the National Assembly is a national celebration. According to the provisions of the appendix to the Representative Election Law, newspaper reporter groups are entitled to send eleven representatives to attend. This is sufficient to show the Central Government's utmost importance to public opinion. However, there are few legally established reporter groups in various places. Taking Xi'an City as an example, there are more than ten newspapers and more than one hundred reporters, and it is also regrettable that they cannot participate. We hereby telegraph to your esteemed committee and office, asking you to consider the situation and promptly seek remedial measures so that the laws can adapt to the facts. We await your orders with utmost anticipation. Xi'an Municipal Newspaper Association. (Central Telegraph, 18th)</p>

<h3>The Beihai Zhongye Case: Initial Investigation Proves Difficult; Ling Shifen's Brief Visit to Beihai Yields No Results; Returns to the Provincial Capital to Report and is Ordered to Return by Ship</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Regarding the Beihai Zhongye case, the Japanese side has recently been eager to investigate the matter, repeatedly inquiring about methods. However, Diao Zuqian, the special envoy for foreign affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, stated that government authority does not extend to Beihai. The Lianzhou area is still garrisoned by Weng Zhaoyuan's Guangxi army, which has not yet withdrawn. Therefore, the first step in the investigation of the case has not been completed, and negotiations cannot begin. According to recent observations, a detailed investigation can only begin after the Beihai garrison under Weng Zhaoyuan withdraws. Previously, Ling Shifen, secretary of the special envoy's office for foreign affairs, along with Yang Bingli, secretary of the provincial government, and two others, arrived in Beihai aboard the Fu'an warship. Although they briefly landed, they were constrained by circumstances and could not investigate. They hastily returned to the ship and reported to the provincial capital, requesting instructions. According to news from Lianzhou, when Ling and Yang arrived in Beihai on the morning of the 12th, landing was extremely difficult. The Beihai defense forces feared that Ling and Yang would collude with the Japanese in Beihai, leading to a second disturbance. Therefore, after local military officers received a telegram from the provincial government dispatching Ling and Yang to investigate, they deployed troops along the Beihai embankment, strictly inspecting incoming travelers and refusing to allow suspected individuals to disembark. When the Fu'an ship docked, Ling and Yang first submitted a list of names to the local military officers, declaring that no Japanese were accompanying them, before being allowed to land. That morning, Ling and Yang transferred from the Fu'an warship to a Beihai Customs electric boat and landed via the Customs wharf. The wharf was surrounded by sentries, and machine guns were set up nearby, as if facing a major enemy. After landing, they were still unable to move freely. Later, they requested Qiu Guozhen, chief of staff of Weng's division, and Zhong Junsheng, director of the Beihai Municipal Bureau, to guide them. Ling and Yang were then able to rest briefly at the Municipal Bureau. The public followed Ling and Yang to the Municipal Bureau and sent representatives to meet with them, inquiring about the purpose of their visit. Ling and Yang, understanding their intentions, could only reply that they had been ordered to investigate the Zhongye case. At the same time, they reported that a Japanese warship had arrived, and the government, to prevent further incidents, had rushed to dissuade the Japanese warship's investigators from landing lightly and to wait for our investigation. After Ling and Yang announced this, seeing the tense atmosphere in the city, they knew that the investigation would not be easy to initiate. They were forced to return to the Fu'an warship and first notified the Japanese warship Sagayama by signal flag, advising them to stay outside the port temporarily. They then telegraphed the provincial government to request instructions from Diao, the special envoy for foreign affairs. They soon received a reply, ordering them to return to the provincial capital first. Ling and Yang then returned to the provincial capital aboard the original ship on the morning of the 14th to report. The Fu'an warship arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 15th, where it purchased coal. To hasten their report, Ling and Yang no longer traveled by ship but instead took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train to the province that morning, arriving in Guangzhou at 11:00 a.m. They immediately went to see Diao Zuqian, reported on their experience in Beihai, and stated that the Beihai garrison was not responsible for protecting the investigation, which was the greatest difficulty in the case. Therefore, the primary issue was to first order the withdrawal of the Beihai defense forces, and then the case could be investigated. Diao considered this to be within the scope of military administration and, on the morning of the 16th, at 9:00 a.m., accompanied Ling and Yang to visit Huang Musong, chairman of the provincial government, and Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, requesting them to quickly negotiate with the Beihai defense forces for a withdrawal as soon as possible or to assume responsibility for protection to facilitate diplomatic progress. This was accepted. Diao, believing that there was news of the withdrawal of the Beihai garrison, then dispatched Ling Shifen again on the morning of the 17th aboard the Fu'an warship to Beihai for a second time to continue the investigation, seeking the truth on which to base diplomatic negotiations. Meanwhile, Japanese Consul-General ad interim to Guangdong, Yoshitake Sadaharu, upon hearing that our investigator Ling Shifen had returned to the provincial capital, personally visited the office of the special envoy for foreign affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi that morning (the 16th) to inquire about news. Diao reported in detail on the situation of the first investigators in Beihai. The Japanese consul also expressed his views, and the two sides discussed for a long time before the Japanese consul departed. (September 17th)</p>
<h3>Northeastern People in the Past Five Years Endure Oppression from the Enemy, Their Lives Plunging into Despair</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: After seizing the Northeast, the Japanese immediately began to massively relocate farmers from Japan to villages in the Northeast. Using political power, they forcibly confiscated land from native farmers and cultivated it themselves, causing the native farmers to lose their livelihoods and fall into despair, with their food and clothing exhausted. This is the first aspect. The sale and purchase of agricultural products in the Northeast are monopolized by Japanese-established companies, which frequently lower prices according to their needs, causing serious damage to the remaining farmers and leading many to bankruptcy. This is the second aspect. In preparation for war against the Soviet Union, the Japanese have spared no effort in constructing military railways over the past five years. Wherever they pass, they unconditionally confiscate land and houses from native farmers, leaving them with nowhere to live. This is the third aspect. This is a general overview of the Japanese oppression of farmers in the Northeast. As for the oppression of workers, after the September 18th Incident, national industries in the Northeast suffered from the attack of Japanese merchants and withered like autumn leaves. Laborers and workers who previously relied on these industries for their livelihoods are now wandering the streets, becoming starving corpses. Some who work in factories opened by the Japanese receive treatment far different from that of Japanese workers. For example, Japanese skilled workers in yarn factories and coal mines can earn an average of about 30 yuan per month, working eight hours a day. In contrast, Chinese workers toil hard for ten or twelve hours or more each day, earning at most only 3 jiao or so per day. It goes without saying that their meager income is insufficient to support their families. However, that is not all. In addition to this cruel economic exploitation, they also suffer from a kind of extra-economic political oppression. For example, workers in factories are not allowed to talk to more than two companions at a time, otherwise they are considered troublemakers and dismissed. Workers are not allowed to organize or join labor unions and are not allowed to move freely. They must permanently reside in workshops near the factory, paying a fixed rent each month. If workers gather in groups of five or three, they are considered to be holding meetings and are followed and monitored by Japanese police, even arrested. As for female and child laborers, their exploitation is even more tragic. Child laborers usually work about 14 hours a day, receiving only 2 jiao or no pay at all. The same is true for female laborers, who must also endure the trampling and humiliation of Japanese foremen, daring not to speak out. Their tragic fate is often too unbearable to describe. This is a general outline of the oppression suffered by the majority of workers. As for capitalists and entrepreneurs, due to the flooding of the market with Japanese goods and the cessation of sales of domestic goods, the factories and companies they operate have been forcibly bought by the Japanese side, making it impossible to operate, and they have all fallen into bankruptcy. As for young students, they are denied freedom of thought and freedom of education, and they are readily labeled as communists and killed without exception. Their cruelty is even more unnecessary to describe in detail.</p>
<h3>Hebei and Chahar: Candidates for the Economic Council are Being Sought; Li Sihao and Zhang Hu Have No Intention of Accepting the Position; Wang Kemin's Resignation Has Not Yet Been Approved</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Regarding the North China economic development matter, after Wang Kemin's visit to the North was thwarted and he angrily resigned, the Japanese military's stance on this matter has shifted from direct to indirect, only urging the Hebei and Chahar authorities to find a suitable person to take charge of the Economic Council. At the same time, they also hope that the person responsible has a considerable connection with the current regime in North China, which would be more appropriate. Regarding Wang Kemin personally, apart from the faction of staff officers Wachi and Senta, who are strongly opposed, Commander Tadai, Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Director of the Ikeda Economic Advisory Department, and others mostly hold a more moderate view. Last week, the Tokyo military sent a telegram to Tianjin regarding this matter, giving instructions to the garrison headquarters. Tadai and Hashimoto specially summoned Wachi and Senta to inform them, so the anti-Wang atmosphere has subsided recently. Even the colored newspapers under the direction of certain individuals are not attacking and slandering him with the same force as before. Song Zheyuan personally has no preconceived notions about Wang, but too many of his aides are acting out of self-interest, fearing that Wang's rise to power would be detrimental to them and that Wang would seize economic power, thus restricting their actions. Therefore, they have been the most vocal in inciting opposition. However, after Wang's resignation, the situation in North China is as it is, and Song is surrounded by his aides. No one with foresight dares to come. Therefore, although Song has received Wang's resignation letter, he has not yet expressed his opinion. During a banquet for Wang at the Bei Ning official residence on Haihe Road on the evening of the 15th, he spoke of other matters, neither approving the resignation nor expressing his desire to retain him. It is widely rumored that Song is looking for a successor and will only announce his approval of Wang's resignation when a replacement is found. At this juncture, it is rumored that there are three internally decided candidates: Li Sihao, Zhang Hu, and Zhang Shizhao. Li Sihao was invited to the North this spring, and he met with Song once, but the result was unfavorable, and he quietly returned to the South. Li refused to take the position, so Wang Kemin was considered. Now Li is being considered again. According to those close to him here, he has no intention of going north, regretting that Wang Kemin was manipulated by others. Zhang Hu has abandoned his political career in recent years and is not engaged in any activities. His mind is like still water, and he is even less willing to change his simple life for a temporary impulse. As for Zhang Shizhao, he came to Tianjin to appear in court for the case of acting as an agent for a Russian woman's inheritance, and he has not yet left. Although he is not an economic expert, some believe that he has the talent to be a long-sleeved dancer and have recommended him to Song. On the afternoon of the 16th, at 3:00 p.m., Song, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, director of the Bei Ning Railway Bureau, personally visited his residence on Penglai Street in the Japanese concession to discuss and exchange views. That evening, at 7:00 p.m., he hosted a banquet at the Bei Ning official residence on Haihe Road, inviting Zhang Zizhong and Chen Zhongfu as guests. Judging from the situation, if neither Li nor Zhang can be moved and Wang's resignation cannot be reversed, then as a last resort, this person may be used as a replacement. As for whether he can open up diplomatic avenues depends on Zhang's personal skills.</p>
<p>Regarding the economic development plan, we would very much like the Japanese side to draw up a plan so that there are restrictions, to avoid endless demands in the future and being exhausted in dealing with them. However, the Japanese side is in favor of gradual progress, without being subject to any restrictions. Any discovery will be regarded as a source of economic development. For example, the newly established General Audit Office of the Hebei-Chahar Council is levying new taxes, which is also a current issue in economic cooperation. However, the Japanese side is reluctant to record it and list it in the requested items. In fact, they are more eager for it than any other event. Therefore, it is not easy for Song to find a person to take on this role, which is in between diplomacy, economics, and politics. On the afternoon of the 17th, at 3:00 p.m., Wang Kemin met with Song Zheyuan at No. 133, 17th Road, in the British concession. They talked for an hour. Song only expressed to Wang, "In the current situation, everything is difficult to handle. In the future, I still ask you to go to Peiping to assist in everything. It's good to be working for the country. Whether in power or in opposition, we must all work together." He still made no clear statement regarding Wang's resignation. (September 17th)</p>

<p>Tragic Boat Capsizing in the Yangtze River</p>
<p>On the Yangtze River near the Dragon King Temple in Beixin Lock, Sixth District of the county, a seagoing vessel passed by the day before yesterday, fully loaded with bran cakes. It was sailing downstream from Zhenjiang to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 3:00 p.m., a strong wind suddenly arose, and in an instant, a terrifying wave surged. The seagoing vessel became like a small leaf boat, with no one to steer it and no help to call for. As the wind was very strong, the ship lost its steering and capsized. All 22 people on board fell into the water at the same time and were swept away by the current. At that time, there was a lifeboat on the river. Seeing this scene, it hurriedly rowed to rescue them, but the white waves were overwhelming, the river surface was vast, and the wind and water were swift. Only one person was rescued. Afterwards, the leader of the Hushu security detachment sent a small boat to investigate and learned about the ship's losses, which were quite unfortunate.</p>
<p>Cook Dismissed from Post Commits Suicide</p>

Recently, due to a change of directors, a large number of patrol officers, inspectors, and directors of the branch bureau were changed, and Zhang Bing also lost his job. He lodged in the Economic Hotel, but soon ran out of money. As a result, he bought and ingested raw opium and committed suicide. The county government sent officials to examine the body and ordered the local bailiffs to bury it.</p>

<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>National Society of the Principles of Life</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: The National Society of the Principles of Life has been established in the capital for more than a year. Its purpose is to persuade people to abstain from tobacco and alcohol, eradicate all narcotic drugs and various bad habits, and secretly embrace the principles of the New Life Movement. In particular, it leads comrades of the Society of the Principles of Life in various provinces and cities to jointly organize a sound organization, which is taken very seriously. During the current registration period, there are some differences of opinion in various aspects. It is heard that the association deals with disputes of various subordinate associations impartially and resolves them through peaceful means, never adding coercive behavior. Whenever there is an unreasonable subordinate association with barbaric character, the association immediately submits the entire case to the Central Ministry of Public Training and applies for verification. Recently, Shao Zhiguang and Zhao Changchun of the Dongtai Society of the Principles of Life Branch Preparatory Office have been capricious and have attempted to coerce the association. The association has not compared itself with them and has ordered the subordinate association to return the registration certificates one by one and submit all the text of the subordinate association that insults the general association to the Central Government without concealment, showing that the association is frank and open. After the association presented to the Central Government, the Public Training Department of the Central Executive Committee instructed that the association's record be filed and approved the revocation of the Dongtai Society of the Principles of Life Branch.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Fire on Baizhang Road in Jiangdong</p>
<p>Fu Yihe Copper and Tin Shop, located at the intersection of Zhufang Street on Baizhang Road in Jiangdong, this port, is a property established by Chuan Dingyang himself. It has three buildings, front and rear, and has been operating for many years, and the business is doing well. In addition to two buildings for his own use, the remaining building is rented to Zhu Yongxing, a native of Shaoxing, as a warehouse, with fire insurance of 2,000 yuan. At about 3 pm yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of Fu Yihe, which quickly spread through the roof. All the dragons heard the alarm and rescued each other, and it was extinguished after more than an hour. It is estimated that two three-story buildings of Fu Yihe, one three-story building of Yongle Grocery Store, one three-story building of Bao Shunxing Qingji Xiang Store, one three-story building of Yu Songtao's Fate Hall, one three-story building of Minghua Watch Store, one three-story building of Bao Shunxing Shengxun Xiang Store, one three-story building of Shi Jintai, two three-story buildings of Yifa Laundry, one three-story building of Yipinxiang Noodle Shop, and one three-story building of Zhu Yongxing's warehouse on Zhongjie Street, one three-story building of Li Fufang, one empty building, and two demolished buildings were burned down. A total of fourteen three-story buildings were burned down and two were demolished, with a loss of no less than 20,000 yuan. Because most of the properties were self-owned, the cause of the fire was said to be caused by the residual fire of a cigarette butt. When the fire broke out, the female owner of Bao Shunxing fell from the building. Because she was pregnant, she was seriously injured and had been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Female Passenger Commits Suicide on Train</p>
<p>At about 5:00 p.m. yesterday (the 15th), on the Longhai slow train from Haizhou to Xinpu, a female passenger, about 20 years old, suddenly swallowed matches. A military police officer on the train saw this and immediately stopped her. When the train arrived at Xinpu Station, he asked her to get off the train and asked her name and why she committed suicide. The woman refused to tell the truth, only answering that her name was Li Xuezhi, she was 23 years old, and she was from Wanzai County, Jiangxi Province. A few days ago, she took a train from home to the Haizhou City Teachers College to look for a classmate but did not find him. The money on her side was exhausted, so she had the idea of ​​despairing of the world. The night before, she had attempted to hang herself unsuccessfully in a hotel in Haizhou City. This afternoon at 4:00 p.m., a police officer from the Public Security Bureau escorted me onto the train. At the same time, a tax police officer helped me with ten silver dollars to go to Lianyungang to find friends, so I committed suicide on the train again. The military police officer saw that she had swallowed a small number of matches and immediately persuaded her and told her not to commit suicide again. At about 7:00 p.m., the woman took the Longhai eastbound express train to Lianyungang.</p>

On the same night, at Ganlu Temple, the home of farmer Shi Kequan was robbed by more than ten bandits, who stole 37 yuan in banknotes from the sale of cotton, plus bedding and other items worth over 100 yuan. The area of Zhou Dong Village is remote and isolated, beyond the reach of military police. Families with slight savings are coveted by bandits, and there is a fear of not being able to sleep peacefully at night.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Joint Transportation by Huainan Railway and Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Huainan Railway this year, it has not only facilitated coal transportation for the Huainan Mining Bureau, but also benefited cargo transportation and business travel in central Anhui. In order to develop its business and facilitate transportation, the Mining Bureau has recently partnered with the Bengbu Huaihe Shipping Cooperative to jointly operate passenger and freight transportation, with Tianji'an as the central hub for development. After thorough consultations with Chen Ruchen, the person in charge of the cooperative, a passenger and freight joint transportation contract was signed, and Chen was also hired as a coordinator for the Mining Bureau. The cooperative has five fast steamboats, which will begin operations on the 16th, with daily steamboat services between Bengbu and Tianji'an. Services will also be offered simultaneously at all stations along the Huainan Railway and at various wharves along the Huaihe River, with Tianji'an as the terminal for connecting transportation. Currently, the shipping cooperative is temporarily operating the Bengbu-Tianji'an route and will soon expand to the Tian-Zheng and Beng-Zheng (i.e., Zhengyangguan) routes. Preparations are already underway, and the plan has been submitted to the party and government organs for record-keeping. With the cooperation of boats and trains, it is expected that business development will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3>International Affairs Research Association Held a Tea Party Yesterday</h3>
<p>Welcoming Zhu Xuefan and Shou Yicheng, Bidding Farewell to Yang Yinpu and Xu Gongsu</p>
<p>The International Affairs Research Association held a tea party yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road to welcome Zhu Xuefan, our country's labor representative who recently attended the International Labor Conference, and Shou Yicheng, who returned from studying in Japan. They also bid farewell to Yang Yinpu and Xu Gongsu, commissioners dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the League of Nations Office. Apart from Zhu Xuefan, who was unable to attend due to business, Shou Yicheng, Yang Yinpu, Xu Gongsu, Guo Bingwen, Zhu Shaoping, Li Zhaohuan, Xu Peihuan, Wu Kaisheng, Liu Yunfang, Lin Kanghou, Wu Songgao, Huang Renzhi, Zhao Shutong, Cheng Haifeng, Cao Yunxiang, Li Yunliang, Shen Xinqing, Wu Guanghan, Jin Guobao, and others attended. After Chairman Guo Bingwen delivered a speech, Yang Yinpu, Xu Gongsu, Shou Yicheng, and Wu Songgao, Director of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave speeches. The event ended at around 7:00 PM. The contents of their speeches are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's Speech</p>
<p>Yang Yinpu's speech briefly stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed an economic commissioner to the League of Nations Office in Geneva because it is a central point for international affairs. His tasks are: (1) to prepare and collect various materials, such as those related to law and economics, etc.; (2) to collect foreign materials to meet domestic needs; (3) to introduce domestic materials to meet foreign needs; (4) to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the economies of various countries. The above four points are his direct tasks. His indirect tasks include research on the overall relationship of the international economy. The international situation is very complex, either dividing or uniting. For example, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, dumping of coal and oil in Europe and the United States, and joining the League of Nations are trends of dividing and then uniting. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct thorough research on the world's economic situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Speech</p>
<p>Xu Gongsu's speech briefly stated that we should not have extremely high hopes for the League of Nations, but we should not underestimate it either. Because it is indeed an organization that maintains peace and promotes international cooperation. Before war or conflict breaks out between countries, the League of Nations can try to mediate. If war or conflict occurs, because the League of Nations' power is limited, it is impossible to expect the League of Nations to impose sanctions. The League of Nations should maintain world peace and promote various forms of cooperation through alliances. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country attaches great importance to the League of Nations. This decision to dispatch an economic commissioner to the League of Nations Office is to jointly cooperate in researching the world economy.</p>
<p>Mr. Shou's Speech</p>
<p>Shou Yicheng's speech briefly stated that this time, he led a team to Japan to investigate the banking system in preparation for reorganizing the Central Bank. At the same time, he also took the opportunity to investigate the general situation. The economic issues between China and Japan are very complex. It is necessary to study how to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, especially economic diplomacy with Japan. Since the coup in Japan, its national policy has also been undergoing transformation. Japanese businessmen's observations of the puppet Manchuria are that those who are familiar with the world's economic situation also consider the situation to be complex, so those who invest in the puppet Manchuria are also particularly cautious.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Wu Songgao's speech briefly stated: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a League of Nations Special Committee to connect the League of Nations and China. It will first establish an economic commissioner, and then establish a legal commissioner, etc. It is hoped that each commissioner will fully develop their tasks and establish close relations with the League of Nations, seeking cooperation technically. (2) Since the September 18th Incident, people generally believe that the League of Nations is too weak. However, it should be clear that the League of Nations cannot prevent wars and conflicts. The League of Nations is a maintainer of peace. The methods of studying the League of Nations issues are: (1) to improve general international knowledge; (2) to find ways to publicize the international situation, such as publishing publications, so that people can understand; (3) to connect international emotions and assist the government's diplomacy.</p>

<h3>Indigenous Cloth Movement: 5th Anniversary Commemorative Meeting Yesterday, Approximately 500 Representatives from Various Agencies Attended, with Indigenous Cloth on Display for All Sectors to Observe</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 5th anniversary of the Indigenous Cloth Movement. The China Native Products Promotion Association held a special 5th anniversary commemorative meeting at the Chongnong Hall in Huangwu, Zhuanqiao, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Approximately 500 people attended, including association members, representatives from various agencies and organizations, farmers, and farm women. Ru Bocai, Jiang Bi, Zhao Hualong, Wang Guanchang, and others served as hosts. In addition to various indigenous cloths, photos, and inscriptions were displayed in the auditorium for all sectors to observe. At 6:30 AM, the meeting was called to order with the ringing of a bell. Zhang Yi presided over the meeting, Qian Zhengfang served as the recorder, and Zhang Nanshan served as the master of ceremonies. After the formalities were completed, the chairman delivered a report, stating in brief that the indigenous cloth movement is a movement to save the country and a movement to revive the nation. Central Committee member Wu Zhihui once said that the indigenous cloth movement is indeed a movement related to the survival of China. The Premier believed that this was an important task to solve the people's livelihood problem, and he spoke earnestly about it in his lectures on the Three Principles of the People. This movement began in September of the 20th year of the Republic of China and has lasted for five years. Thanks to the advocacy of the political authorities and the support of people from all walks of life, it has achieved considerable success. Not only are those who wear indigenous cloth not ashamed, but also the production of indigenous cloth has greatly improved. The government's protection of the development of the indigenous cloth industry has been meticulous. Indigenous cloth movement exhibitions and other activities in various provinces and regions are often reported in the newspapers, which have contributed to the spirit, economy, and national defense. At this time when the countryside is declining and the lives of farmers are in deep water, and foreign forces are becoming increasingly powerful, we should strive to promote the popularity of indigenous cloth, based on the determination to promote indigenous cloth, and move forward for the entire national salvation work, so that we will not fail the grand commemoration of today. Representatives from various sectors, including Cai Zaoshi and Ru Xiaojiang, gave speeches, which were very exciting. At 8:40 AM, the meeting was adjourned with slogans. The slogans are recorded below: (1) Promote indigenous cloth to save the countryside, (2) Promote indigenous cloth to revive the nation, (3) Promote indigenous cloth to advocate frugality, (4) Promote indigenous cloth to stop waste, (5) Compatriots, let's all rise up to promote indigenous cloth, (6) Compatriots, let's all rise up to wear indigenous cloth, (7) Long live the indigenous cloth movement, (8) Long live the Chinese nation. The association also prepared more than 5,000 slogans promoting indigenous cloth and posted them in various villages to encourage the public. The Shanghai County Indigenous Cloth Wearing Association should also take this opportunity to solicit members. The future of indigenous cloth has infinite hope.</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce Explains the Nature of the Inspection Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously inquired about the truth of the matter after the Hebei-Chahar Political Council established the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, fearing that it would help the circulation of smuggled goods. The reply from the Political Council is as follows: To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, your telegram has been received. The trend of smuggling has recently become more rampant. North China is in an extraordinary position, and it is even more inappropriate to adopt a laissez-faire policy. If smuggled goods are not cleared by law, the customs may not be able to reach them. Therefore, in order to comply with the business community's wishes and adapt to local conditions, it is proposed to change the inspection offices in the Cang Salt and Coastal Defense ports into the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office to inspect various smuggled goods. The scope of inspection is limited to smuggled goods that have already landed and leaked out, in other words, those that have crossed the customs line and are being transported or have entered the hands of inland merchants. It should not affect customs revenue. This measure has not yet been implemented and is originally intended to assist in anti-smuggling. Once the inspection is in place, existing goods will not be detained and affect commerce, and future goods will be alerted and gradually reduced. It will be stopped in three or four months and is not a permanent measure. As for the establishment of the Cang Salt and Coastal Defense port inspection offices, they were only for investigating and cracking down on smuggling and did not collect taxes. The newspaper report that taxes were collected at one-eighth of the customs duty is purely a rumor and does not conform to the facts. Please do not believe it. Answering your inquiry, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, seal of the council.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Announced the Provisional Measures for Boiler Inspection Yesterday. Factories Equipped with Boilers Must Register and Obtain Qualification Certificates from the Inspection Section</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Local Bank Trial Operation of Farmer and Fisherman Loans, Effective in Yuqian, Yin County, Yuhuan and Other Counties, Now Decided to Find Ways to Promote and Make it Universal Throughout the Province</h3>
<p>In addition to handling various agricultural loans, the Zhejiang Local Bank also tried to operate farmer and fisherman loans, which have been quite effective. It has now been decided to find ways to promote and make it universal throughout the province. The report is recorded below.</p>
<p>Farmer Loans</p>
<p>The bank, in view of the remote location, poor land, and poverty of the people in Qian County, and the long-standing economic distress of the countryside, signed a loan agreement with the county's Farmers Lending Office in the autumn of the 23rd year to cooperate in handling farmer loans in the county. With the enthusiastic advocacy of the county's party and government authorities, it has progressed smoothly over the past three years. According to statistics, more than 2,000 yuan was loaned out in the winter of the 23rd year, which was not much and the amount was small, all to meet the short-term emergency needs of farmers. In the spring of the 24th year, 30,000 yuan was loaned out for spring ploughing, with more than 700 mutual aid societies benefiting. Its effectiveness has spread to famous villages throughout the county. In the winter of that year, more than 6,000 yuan was loaned out under guarantee, and all were repaid on time and in full, with good results. In April of this year, the bank continued to handle seedling loans of more than 30,000 yuan, targeting more than 470 cooperative preparatory societies. In the future, the bank plans to focus on propaganda of cooperation and training of cooperative talents, so that cooperative preparatory societies can be reorganized into formal cooperative societies. It also plans to investigate the county's production industries to prepare for the organization of cooperative marketing. Furthermore, in view of the fact that Yin County has no financial institutions and farmers have a strong need for capital adjustment, the bank signed an agreement with the county government in the spring of the 24th year. Before the county's agricultural financial agency is formally established, the bank will provide funds and handle farmer loans throughout the county. The two parties will work together to carry out rural relief work and promulgate farmer loan rules based on the bank's agricultural and industrial loan regulations. The target of loans is mainly cooperative societies, but before cooperative society organizations are widely established, special farmer loans (i.e., individual farmer loans) may be handled. Borrowers are purely individual farmers, and all matters such as registration and investigation are handled by the county government, while the bank is responsible for lending. At that time, the bank had already loaned out a portion of cooperative loans in the county, so the portion handled on behalf of the county was almost entirely individual farmer loans, totaling more than 560 households, with each household borrowing a minimum of 10 yuan and a maximum of 50 yuan, for a total of about 20,000 yuan. All were repaid after the autumn harvest. It will continue to be handled this year and will be expanded slightly, with the amount increased to more than 110,000 yuan. Currently, Fenghua and other places have also signed agreements with the local county government to handle the matter according to the above method.</p>
<p>Fisherman Loans</p>
<p>Yuhuan is located by the sea, and most of its residents rely on fishing for a living. However, every time it is time to go to sea to fish, each fisherman needs considerable funds to repair his fishing boat and provide food for his family. The source of these funds has always been the local fishermen's association, which lends money to fishermen at a fixed interest rate. However, the interest rate is very high, and fishermen feel oppressed. Although the temporary difficulties are solved, the difficulties of the future are not alleviated. Not only that, but the oppression of fishermen is so deep that the development of the entire fishing industry is stagnant, which has a profound impact on the future of the fishing industry. The Yongjia Administrative Inspectorate, in view of this, consulted with the bank on lending as a way to remedy the situation. The bank also felt that it was urgent to provide relief to the fishing industry and that it was in line with the bank's plan, so it readily agreed and began a pilot program in the 23rd year, with an initial amount of 30,000 yuan. The Commissioner's Office organized a fishermen's lending office to be responsible for handling the matter. The county's fishing industry has always been dominated by fishing boat operations, so the loan regulations stipulate that loans should be granted to large and small fishing boats organized by fishermen, divided into three types: credit, mortgage, and guarantee. The maximum term is one year, and all loans are designated for use in fishing production. Since the loans were granted, progress has been quite good, and fishermen have been able to perform their duties, engage in production, and repay the loans on time. Last year, the loans were expanded, with the amount increased to 70,000 yuan, and the same method was used. The effect was also good. Looking at the coastal areas of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, all of which are offshore fishing areas, more than 100,000 households directly or indirectly depend on fishing for a living. Therefore, the development of the fishing industry is related to the livelihoods of these more than 100,000 fishermen. At this time when the fishing industry is in danger, the scope of lending should be expanded to provide universal relief, alleviate the fishermen's difficulties, and strengthen the foundation of the fishing industry. The bank's Yuhuan fisherman loans are just a prelude.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Industrial and Commercial Management Office in Contact for Loans</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Jiangxi Industrial and Commercial Management Office is in contact with four banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers' Bank, and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, for agricultural warehouse loans of 6 million yuan, with 1 million yuan to build warehouses and 5 million yuan to handle storage and pawn loans. Xiao Chunjin, director of the office, is in contact with the above four banks. In the future, the agricultural warehouses under the Jiangxi Yumin Bank will be taken over by the Industrial and Commercial Management Office. The storage and pawn loans will also be handled by the Industrial and Commercial Management Office.</p>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter visited Qian Chengxin, deputy manager of Jiangxi Yumin Bank, yesterday morning. According to him, Jiangxi Yumin Bank is making every effort to promote various agricultural loans. More than 20 agricultural warehouses in various counties, including Nanchang, have been completed. Now, under the order of Chairman Xiong of the provincial government, in order to provide relief to farmers, funds have been allocated to purchase rice. The executive meeting has decided to handle this matter first in areas where warehouses have been established, and at the same time to handle rice storage and pawn loans.</p>

<h3>Changshu Guild Hall Requests Correction of Abuses in Standard Measures</h3>
<p>Merchants Have Suffered Considerable Losses Over the Years</p>
<p>Hoping that the Authorities Will Swiftly Crack Down</p>
<p>The Changshu Guild Hall sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs' Weights and Measures Inspection Office and the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association, requesting the correction of heavy measures and obstructed scales to eliminate long-standing abuses. The letter states: "We are writing to inform you that this guild hall has found that our merchants who transport rice to Shanghai for sale do so to make a living and to adjust grain transportation and maintain food supply. However, in recent years, due to the dumping of imported rice and the unstable prices of domestic rice, our merchants have been struggling, earning very little each month. If they encounter unfortunate events such as wind and rain collisions, they suffer losses of tens of dollars for minor incidents and even lose their entire family fortune for major incidents. Compensating for losses is not enough. This shows the hardship of our merchants. Furthermore, there are long-standing inequalities among the industry members, namely that the officials cannot understand the suffering of our merchants. When transactions are completed and measures are used, heavy measures and obstructed scales are used, resulting in an average loss of 7-8 tenths to 1 liter of rice per measure for our merchants. This long-standing practice has led to endless abuses and countless harms. Over the years, they have endured hardship and cried out in vain. At this time, when the authorities are correcting measures and eliminating abuses, the government of the party and politics will surely start anew, benefiting all. We respectfully request that you swiftly crack down and correct these abuses to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and benefit their business."</p>

The husband and concubine had a good relationship. Wang paid Dai 35 yuan per month for expenses, rent, and food, and another 10 yuan for miscellaneous expenses. Dai saved 20 yuan, which she deposited in the Zhongfu and Guohua banks. Everything was peaceful.

Wang then hired lawyer Xu Lianghao to file a lawsuit in the Special Second Court, requesting a judgment to sever the family relationship with Dai Xiulin and recover the deposits. The defendant, Dai Xiulin, also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and He Xiantong to file a defense and file a counterclaim, requesting the court to order the plaintiff and counterclaim defendant to increase her monthly expenses by 30 yuan. Based on the complaint, Judge Li Liang presided over the hearing in Civil Court 7 yesterday. Both parties arrived with their lawyers and stated their requests. Dai Xiulin denied running away with belongings and still wished to return home and live together. The court verified the facts and ordered the lawyers of both parties to debate before announcing the conclusion and setting the judgment for 3 PM on the 23rd before adjourning.</p>

Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special Court opened the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer for the police station, stated that with regard to the involvement of Dr. Hou Guangdi, Hou had stated to the police station that his clinic in the Continental Commercial Center was not used in the morning. In April of this year, a Dr. Wang Wanli went to rent it and set up a clinic. At that time, there was a guarantee, and the guarantor was named Gu Pengcheng. The guarantee had been submitted to the police station. It was found that Hou was indeed not involved. The female suspect Fei Wang has also been found by the police station to have no significant relationship. Therefore, he requested the court to cancel the detention warrant and allow her to be released. The court then asked Fei Wang whether the Hongkou Gynecology Hospital specialized in abortions. She replied that she only heard that they advertised that they specialized in treating menstrual diseases. The day before I returned to my hometown on July 17th, a man and a woman came to see a doctor. When I left the hospital on the 17th, the two were still fine. The woman was sleeping in bed, and the man was sitting at the foot of the bed. As for the whereabouts of the owners, I really don't know. The court then informed her that the police station was not prosecuting her and would release her today. However, if she heard any news about the owners, she should report to the police station immediately. She repeatedly promised. Judge Zhong ordered Wei Wang to be released. It was also learned that the bodies of the man and woman were examined by the forensic doctor of the First Special Court and found to have been strangled to death. The gauze surrounding the woman's genital area was also taken back by the forensic doctor for research. It has now been determined to be a menstrual belt. The woman's intestines had flowed out. The strangest thing was that the uterus inside the genitals could not be found anywhere.</p>

<h3>Liu A'bing Obstructs Official Business: Admits to Throwing Lime, Denies Chopping with Ax; Court Police Officer Sun Provides Detailed Account of Injury; Debate Concludes, Sentencing on the 23rd</h3>
<p>A row of houses at No. 162 Changping Road in West Shanghai is the property of a local man named Shen. Because several tenants owed rent for months, Shen filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court. A judgment was made for the tenants to repay the full amount. When the execution date arrived on the 15th of last month, the court dispatched clerk Yang Yumin, bailiff Lu Zhaoxiong, and judicial police officer No. 12 Sun Qingshan to seize the property. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the door of No. 148 for execution, Liu A'bing (age 54) from Jiangyin, a resident of the house, resisted. He threw lime at bailiff Lu and police officer Sun. He also used an ax to chop officer Sun four times, causing severe injuries. The police were alerted and dispatched detectives who transported officer Sun to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. Simultaneously, the assailant Liu A'bing, along with the ax, were taken into custody by the First Special District Court. Because officer Sun's injuries had not healed, Liu was ordered to be detained pending interrogation. Details of this event have been previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that officer Sun's injuries have slightly improved. This morning, the police escorted Liu A'bing to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for obstructing official duties under Articles 135, Section 132 of the Criminal Code. According to the victim, officer No. 12 Sun Qingshan, on the morning of August 15th, he was ordered to accompany clerk Yang, bailiff Lu, and others to Changping Road for seizure. Four houses had already been completed. The defendant was the fifth house. Unexpectedly, upon seeing them, the defendant immediately questioned bailiff Lu about why he had not been notified before sealing the door, leading to an argument. The defendant first threw lime at Lu. When Sun stepped forward to intervene, the defendant took lime from his pocket and threw it at him. At that time, while Sun was bending down to pick up a fallen seal, the defendant picked up more lime from the wall and threw it, then fiercely chopped at him four times with the ax, blinding his eyes. His waist, back, and legs were severely injured. Subsequently, the police transported him to the Municipal Council Hospital. At the time, his body was swollen, his breathing was rapid, and his life was in grave danger. Fortunately, President Xie and Doctor Guo provided emergency treatment and dedicated care, preserving his life. However, he has not fully recovered and requests severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant admitted to throwing lime twice, but denied chopping with the ax four times. He claimed that because he was surrounded, he simply threw a wood-splitting knife, which happened to hit the officer. After debate by both lawyers, Judge Huang announced that the case would be sentenced on the 23rd, and the defendant was returned to police custody.</p>
<h3>Educational Circle Personnel Sue for Daughter</h3>
<p>Chen Jingchu and He Chengfu Fall Out</p>
<p>Incorrect Jurisdiction, Awaiting Transfer for Handling</p>
<p>Chen Jingchu, a native of Yancheng residing at No. 36 Huangjia Que Road, outside the West Gate of the Chinese-controlled area, serving as an inspector in the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, after his wife, Wu, passed away on July 8th of last year, adopted his three-year-old daughter, Xiaofeng, to He Chengfu, a classmate from Zhuji residing at No. 66 Ruihua Fang, Route Lafayette, in the French Concession, who serves as the director of academic affairs at Minli Girls' Middle School and concurrently as the head of Qingxin Girls' School. Recently, Chen suddenly wanted to reclaim his daughter, but after unsuccessful negotiations, Chen reported to the French police station, accusing He Chengfu and his wife, He Qiu, of enticing away the girl. The French Police Department transferred the case to the Second Special District Court, initiating a public prosecution under Article 241 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, the hearing was postponed and both parties were instructed to reconcile outside of court, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Zhang again summoned them in the First Criminal Court, asking if the two parties had made any progress in reconciliation outside of court. According to He Chengfu, yesterday, Education Bureau specialist Jiang Wenbao and Sun Bawu came to his school and tried to reconcile with the principal. Because he was groundlessly accused and his reputation was affected, the plaintiff's accusation of enticing was not supported by evidence. Regarding the extortion point, he was not thinking about money. If the other party could issue a public apology in the newspapers, compensating him for his fostering losses, he could reconcile and return the child. Last night, Jiang came to his house, but he was out. Jiang left a business card, asking him to come to court today, but the situation changed again. Plaintiff Chen Jingchu claimed that He was demanding a large sum of money, forcing him to resort to the law. If He wanted him to apologize, he would respect the law, and if he was wrong, he would accept legal punishment. Subsequently, mediators Wang Manyun and Sun Bawu, two lawyers, arrived to mediate. Both parties agreed on the point of returning fostering losses, with Chen compensating He 300 yuan. However, plaintiff Chen Jingchu absolutely refused to apologize. Defendant He Chengfu insisted that reconciliation was impossible without an apology. After a long period, reconciliation ultimately failed. The court, seeing that both parties were tending towards extremes and both wanted to reclaim the child, declared the reconciliation broken and ordered the debate to begin. Police Department lawyer Yuan Jiahua argued that according to the plaintiff's report to the police station, the defendant's wife went to the plaintiff's residence and took the child away. The location of the incident was in the Chinese-controlled area, and according to Article 4 of the agreement, it was not under the jurisdiction of the court and should be handled according to the law. After further debate by the defendant's lawyer, the court declared the conclusion. The court ruled that the case was under incorrect jurisdiction and would be transferred to the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court for trial. Chen Xiaofeng would be temporarily sent to a nursery for care. Both parties were ordered to pay 50 yuan each to the court.</p>
<h3>Xu Letian and Others Initiate: Forming a Shengxian Native Place Association</h3>
<p>Xu Letian and other natives of Shengxian residing in Shanghai, considering the increasing number of Shengxian natives living and working in Shanghai, and for the purpose of establishing a mutual aid organization and developing the interests of their hometown, initiated the establishment of the Shengxian Native Place Association of Shanghai. They have submitted the application to the Municipal Party Department and it has been approved and filed, with a permit issued. They are now seeking fellow natives to join and work together to advance their cause. The preparatory office is temporarily located at No. 905, Lane Wan, Route Jules Aigier.</p>
<h3>The Tang Couple Sues the Labor Hospital: Where Did the White Powder Come From? Changes Charge From Negligent Homicide to Injury; Court Orders Zhang Xiuyu to Be Summoned for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Tang Liwen, a native of Zhenjiang residing at No. 450, Lane 391, Jiangjia Lane, Route Gordon, and his wife, Tang Wang, recently hired lawyer Tao Gan to sue the doctor of the Labor Hospital at No. 1000 Xiaoshadu Road in the First Special District Court for attempted negligent homicide. The gist of the lawsuit is roughly as follows: The plaintiff's one-year-old son, Da Shizi, was suffering from dysentery in late August of this year. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month at 2:00 PM, they went to the Labor Hospital for diagnosis. The doctor prescribed six packets of white powder, instructing them to administer one packet every hour, mixed with boiled water. The plaintiff administered one packet to Da Shizi at 5:00 PM, but the child refused to eat it. As soon as the medicine entered his mouth, he spat it out. Unexpectedly, wherever the ejected medicine landed, the skin and flesh corroded instantly, and blisters and swelling appeared in his mouth. His throat became painful and changed color immediately. They immediately inquired at the hospital, but the doctor did not admit to prescribing the wrong medicine and took away three packets of the prescribed powder, leaving only one packet. At 9:00 PM that night, they reported to the Putuo Road police station, which dispatched detectives for investigation. The doctor's name was not disclosed, and the child's condition was severe. They were immediately sent to Baolong Hospital, where the hospital's doctor confirmed that the powder was poisonous. Therefore, they are filing a lawsuit under Articles 276, Section 2 and 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Code and request the retrieval of records to verify the doctor's name. The court, noting that there is no such crime as attempted negligent homicide under the Criminal Code, summoned the plaintiff alone yesterday afternoon. The investigating judge opened the Eighth Criminal Court to hear the case and informed the plaintiff of the situation, also showing the police station's files for review. It was then learned that the attending doctor was Zhang Xiuyu (female). The plaintiff's lawyer immediately requested a change in the article of law, prosecuting for negligent injury under Article 284, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. The court ordered the date to be changed to the afternoon of the 25th to summon Zhang Xiuyu for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Former Detective Zhao Jinquan: False Accusation of Judges' Interrogation Record; Misunderstanding of New and Old Cases; Results in Bribery Rumor Case</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinquan, a former detective of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested two pickpockets, Geng Zhongyi and others, at Xinqiao, west of Xiejiao. The police chief in charge, Zhang Dasi, considered his arrest to be rash and detained Zhao Jinquan and Geng Zhongyi together at the substation. Patrol Officer Nie Shaowen ordered Zhao and others to be handcuffed and sent to the Ximen Sub-bureau before sending them to the Public Security Bureau. The handcuffs were then removed from Zhao. The Public Security Bureau handed Geng Zhongyi and others over to the local court for trial and sentencing to three months' imprisonment. Zhao Jinquan then accused Nie Shaowen, Zhang Dasi, and others of injury to the local court. The prosecutor ordered Nie Shaowen and Zhang Dasi to appear in court for interrogation.</p>
<p>A letter from Li Jing, former director of the Ximen Sub-bureau,</p>
<p>guaranteed their release. However, when the public prosecution was initiated, Nie and Zhang failed to appear. The case was not concluded. Details were reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Zhao Jinquan felt resentful because, although Li Jing had resigned, he should still be responsible for ensuring Nie and Zhang's appearance. He repeatedly filed petitions requesting a thorough investigation. Recently, Zhao Jinquan again accused Li Jing of bribing judges. After receiving the accusation, the court ordered Zhao Jinquan to appear in court. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang interrogated and detained him, believing that Zhao Jinquan had indeed made a false accusation and filed</p>
<p>a public prosecution according to the law.</p>
<p>It was briefly stated that Zhao Jinquan, formerly a detective of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was interfered with by police chief and patrol officer Nie Shaowen of the Ximen Sub-bureau on June 3rd of last year while arresting thieves. He had previously investigated and accused Nie Shaowen and others of injury. During the investigation, Nie Shaowen and others were released on guarantee by Li Jing, director of the Xidou Sub-bureau. They failed to appear during the trial. Zhao Jinquan requested Judge He Jingcen to sign an arrest warrant for Li Jing, which was approved and requested by the Shanghai Second Special District Court for assistance in the arrest, but was not successful. Zhao Jinquan then filed a complaint against Li Jing for facilitating escape, with the complaint marked as Case No. 2287 of the Litigation Department of the 24th year, the number of a previously submitted old case. He instructed the receiver's office to submit it to the court's dispatch office. However, Zhu Binglin, who submitted the complaint on his behalf, did not declare that it was a new case. He took the complaint back and had Zhao Jinquan rewrite it, which he</p>
<p>submitted by post.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Kong Xianglin sent a letter to the Shanghai Second Special District Court requesting assistance in summoning Li Jing for investigation and decided not to prosecute. A request for reconsideration was filed and was rejected by the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court. Zhao Jinquan then added fabricated facts, claiming that Judge He refused to arrest Li Jing, the receiving office refused to accept his complaint against Li Jing, and Prosecutor Kong did not detain Li Jing when he appeared in court and did not believe that Li Jing had appeared in court. On November 24th of last year, he saw Li Jing, who claimed that he had sent 5,000 yuan to Judge He, rendering your lawsuit ineffective, and that Feng Guming could testify to this. He filed a complaint with the court accusing Judge He and Prosecutor Kong of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes. After thorough investigation, based on the following evidence, it was determined that Zhao Jinquan was suspected of</p>
<p>false accusation</p>
<p>and should be prosecuted according to the law. The evidence and his criminal articles are as follows: Zhao Jinquan accused Judge He Jingcen and Prosecutor Kong Xianglin of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes, solely based on seeing Li Jing moving on November 14th of last year in Dajili. He went up to question him about whether he would appear in court on the 18th. Li replied that whether he appeared or not was irrelevant because he had already sent 5,000 yuan in banknotes to Judge He of the local court, rendering your lawsuit ineffective. Feng Guming was beside him and heard Li Jing say this. However, when Feng Guming was questioned, he</p>
<p>claimed he did not hear this. Li Jing originally lived at No. 4, Dajili, Fangxie Road, and vacated the premises on October 17th of last year. Tenant Chen Xinmeng was summoned and presented the rental record book, which was verified. According to</p>
<p>Chen Xinmeng's testimony,</p>
<p>they gave him a few days of rent, and he moved out around the end of October, definitely not in November. Therefore, Zhao Jinquan's claim that he saw Li Jing moving on November 14th of last year is completely false. Since Li Jing had already moved, claiming that he saw Li Jing moving in Dajili on November 14th of last year and claiming that there was bribery is a fabricated fact and a deliberate false accusation, which is undoubtedly beyond doubt. The defendant has indeed committed the crime under Article 169, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Kangsun</p>
<p>opened the court for trial.</p>
<p>Zhao Jinquan, who was in custody, was brought to the case. He stated that he was 36 years old, from Gaoyou, residing on Liyuan Road, and formerly a detective of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He was asked why he accused the court staff. He replied that on November 14th of last year, he saw Li Jing sitting on a moving truck, so he asked him if he was going to court on the 18th. Li replied that it didn't matter whether he went or not because he had already sent 5,000 yuan to the judge. He was asked why he accused Prosecutor Kong. He replied that it was because the complaint could not be delivered, so he sent it to Chief Zhong by mail, which was to accuse Li Jing of</p>
<p>facilitating escape.</p>
<p>Because the court said that Li Jing had been acquitted, he was asked not to recklessly make false accusations. Even if he refused to appear, he could not immediately say it was bribery. Moreover, in your statement to the prosecutor's office, the statement that Li Jing bribed 5,000 yuan was heard by witness Feng Guming, but when questioned, Feng Guming denied it, which shows that you are falsely accusing. At this point, witness Feng Guming was brought to the case. He stated that he was 34 years old, from Dongtai, and practiced traditional Chinese medicine. In October of last year, he was passing through the intersection of Dajili and Fangxie Road when he saw Zhao Jinquan in conflict with someone wearing a suit. He only heard the person wearing the suit say, "You can sue me if you want, I</p>
<p>have money ready</p>
<p>to fight the lawsuit." As for the 5,000 yuan, he did not hear it. However, there were indeed moving trucks nearby. Witness Wang Guiliang stated that he was the doorman in Dajili and that Li Jing used to live at No. 4 in the lane. He hired a moving truck around the end of October. He was asked if he had seen Li Jing in conflict with anyone, and he replied that he did not know. Lawyer Li Ming, who was retained by the defendant, stated that Li Jing did move by truck and requested that the court investigate the exact date of Li Jing's move. The judge then ordered Zhao Jinquan to be returned to custody pending further notice.</p>

<h3>Western Paint Industry Guild: Sues for Embezzlement Before Examining Accounts; Difficult to Be a Director of the Group; Allegations of the Plaintiff Are Empty</h3>
<p>Because major merchants Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Le Gengrong, and others serve as directors of the Foreign Goods Commercial Guild, they were previously sued by the Shanghai Western Paint Industry Guild, with Ma Shangjie as their agent, in the Second Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Shuoying visited the Second Court to summon both parties for continued trial. Both sides arrived with their respective lawyers. First, Li Zuyu, the defense lawyer for the defendants, stated to the court that the plaintiff's side initially filed the lawsuit in the name of the guild, but later listed the names of ten merchant firms of the plaintiffs in the application. He questioned whether they could file a lawsuit and whether the merchant firms had the capacity to act. He asked the court to pay attention to this. He further stated that the self-proclaimed agent Ma Shangjie was the representative of ten firms, which raised issues under the Criminal Procedure Law. The court said that the plaintiff had submitted a petition today. Lin Yingqing, the defense lawyer for Le Zhenbao, stated that Precedent No. 533 of the Supreme Court in the 20th year of the Republic stated that merchant firms did not have the capacity to act and could not file a lawsuit. The court pointed out that the power of attorney from the plaintiff's side authorized Ma Shangjie, Zhang Shizhao, Chao Kun, Gao Danhua, He Xiaoyuan, etc., which was illegal. Ma replied that Zhang Shizhao had given up and was not appearing in court. The judge stated that four agents were also illegal. Ma replied that nine plaintiffs had authorized him as their representative and had hired three lawyers. At this point, the defendants' lawyer asked the court to resolve the procedural issues first. The court immediately summoned defendant Le Zhenbao for questioning, ordering him to present the three pieces of evidence he had been ordered to bring. Le replied that he had brought them. Zhang Lanping presented the deed of ownership, title deed, and minutes of the meeting. He also presented two bankbooks for the Foreign Goods Commercial Guild and the Renyi Shan Hui from the 23rd and 24th years. Le Zhenbao was asked if the general meeting recorded in the minutes was the same one as on September 22nd of the 23rd year. He replied that it was. Because the Foreign Goods Commercial Guild was illegal and could not be registered, it was reorganized into Renyi Shan Hui. He was a director and did not ask about the accounts of the association. Lin Binyi had previously served as the clerk, and after Lin died this year, someone else took over collecting rent, and someone else managed the association. He was asked if the plaintiff now requested to examine the accounts. He replied that the accounts were in the association and managed by the clerk. Li Zuyu, the defendant's lawyer, stated that regarding the plaintiff's accusation of embezzlement, the plaintiff should point out the facts before the court ordered an investigation of the accounts. Moreover, defendant Le Zhenbao was a director and did not ask about the accounts. Bei Runsheng was asked if he attended the reorganization of Renyi Shan Hui. He replied that he did not attend, but there was a signature book. He resigned as director and sent a letter of notification before it was published in the newspaper. Zhang Lanping was asked if he knew about the bank transactions. He replied that he did not know. He was a director and had many things to do himself. Unless there was a meeting, he would not go to the association. Le Gengrong was asked if he knew about the association's accounts. He replied that he did not manage them. The association was established in the 32nd year of Guangxu, and he was only 19 years old at that time. At this point, the plaintiff Ding Fang'e was summoned, but did not arrive. A representative was sent, but the court did not question them. Shen Leshan was summoned and stated that he was the assistant manager of Wanshunge, acting as manager. The firm had donated money, but the receipt had been lost for many years. Defendant Lin Yingqing, after Shen Leshan's statement, stated to the court that Wanshunge had closed down and Shen was not the manager of Wanshunge. He was now working for Bu Nei Men Foreign Firm and could not come to court to represent Wanshunge. The plaintiff Chen Gengsheng was summoned and stated that various friends in the store had donated money, but the receipt had been lost. The plaintiff Li Shuyan was summoned and stated that he did not participate in the lawsuit. Although his name was listed on the complaint, he did not sign it. Finally, the court asked the plaintiff's representative, Ma Shangjie, how the defendants embezzled funds. Ma replied that their accounts had never been public, which constituted fraud. He requested that the accounts be investigated to clarify the amount of embezzlement and cited the meeting minutes of the Western Paint Industry Guild, but his words were all empty and lacked substance. Defendant Yan Yinwu's lawyer stated that the subject of the lawsuit had not been determined, and the plaintiff's claims were even more empty. Lawyer Lin Yingqing stated that the plaintiff was now discussing property issues in court, but during previous mediation, they had only sought 300 yuan in subsidies. As a result, the court ordered the case to be adjourned to 2:00 PM on the 25th for further questioning and ordered the defendants to submit the account books of the Foreign Goods Commercial Guild for verification.</p>

They will convene an initiators' meeting to elect preparatory members to be responsible for the preparatory work.

<h3>Second Special District National Exhibition Extends Display for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Notification to Manufacturers to Re-register</p>
<p>The Second Special District National Exhibition, located at the intersection of Avenue Petain and Xujiahui in this city, has been open for a month. The temporary market and amusement park attached to the exhibition have been extremely crowded daily, with total business revenue exceeding 36,000 yuan, an excellent result that surpasses the records of previous national exhibitions. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close tonight. However, due to requests from manufacturers to extend the exhibition period, it was decided at yesterday's meeting to approve a two-week extension. Simultaneously, manufacturers are being notified to re-register. The notification states: "Regarding the matter of notification, the exhibition has been open until now and is about to expire. As it is now autumn, the time for autumn goods to enter the market, and the number of visitors will inevitably be large, manufacturers who have not yet participated in the exhibition have requested an extension of the exhibition period. For this reason, the exhibition has approved a two-week extension and will re-organize and decorate the interior to enhance its appearance. It has been decided that each department will subsidize room and electricity fees, totaling seven yuan per room. Those who wish to participate must register with the exhibition office immediately. In order to provide preferential treatment, those who register first will be given priority to avoid missing out due to full capacity. This is a special notification."</p>

<h3>European Travel Diary</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang, from London</p>
<p>(August 11) Lately, I have been watching sports and visiting famous scenic spots, and I do not feel the pain of boredom. After our team's failure in the Games, newspapers and commentators have given us excellent reviews. Therefore, various European countries have sent letters inviting us. For the sake of observing and learning more, although we know that victory is hopeless, we are happy to receive instruction. So, our team did not wait for the closing of the Games and left Berlin by train at 9:00 this morning, arriving in Frankfurt, southern Germany, at 5:00. This city is a famous historical site and the industrial hub of Germany. The Da Xu Berlin also has a station here. In the evening, we were invited to watch an open-air theater performance, which was quite eye-opening. According to my impressions of this Games, although they are very vague, based on my observations, all sports have progressed by ten feet, while we have only progressed by one foot. If we do not fundamentally find a way to innovate, we will never be able to catch up to the standards. I hope that our country's sports authorities will learn a lesson from this and do something to improve.</p>
<p>(August 12) Today we were supposed to compete with a selected team from Southern Germany, but the weather was not good, with heavy rain, so we had to postpone the game. Tomorrow morning, we will be welcomed by the city government and presented with gifts, which I will acknowledge. Then, we will visit various places in the city and the Chinese Academy of Culture, which houses Chinese books, antiques, and cultural wedding dramas, clothing, music, etiquette, everything you could want. Abroad (August 14) We left Germany at 7:00 in the morning by train to Vienna, the capital of Austria, arriving at nightfall. Austrian football players are salaried, and their strength is the best in Europe. Last year, a British professional team came to compete with them and returned defeated. Their strength can be imagined.</p>
<p>(August 15) In the morning, we took a special trip to tour the area. There are many historical sites in this city, which are quite interesting. In the afternoon, we competed with the runner-up team and were defeated by a score of four to two. However, this result is worth celebrating. Austrian football techniques follow the Scottish style, using a lot of triangular short passes for attacks. Although we lost today, we learned many good points.</p>
<p>(August 16) Yesterday, I received news from the Games that Italy finally won the World Cup football championship. I was very envious upon hearing this. In the morning, Director Rong arrived from Berlin to join us. In the afternoon, we met with a strong professional champion team and were miserably defeated by a score of twelve to zero. I have never experienced such a defeat in my life, and I am truly ashamed. The main reasons for our great defeat were: first, we had neglected training after our defeat at the Games; second, we had been traveling by train and in battle too frequently in recent days, resulting in many injuries on the field, and we only had nine players to compete; third, the whole team's morale was scattered, and we were no longer as united as we were during the Southern tour. There were quarrels on the field at every turn. Today, Feng Bao even fought each other out of anger, which was a great loss of civility and the purpose of sports. This great lesson may be a stimulant for the development of football in our country.</p>
<p>(August 17) After the great defeat today, we took a short rest. In the afternoon, we attended a tea party hosted by Minister Liu Chongjie.</p>
<p>(August 18) Early in the morning, we were on the road again, taking a train to Switzerland. There were many tunnels along the way, and the scenery was beautiful, so we did not feel the journey was difficult. We arrived in Bern in the evening and stayed for one night. Here, we met the Japanese football team, who will show their skills here tomorrow.</p>
<p>(August 19) After a brief tour in the morning, we continued our journey by train, arriving in Geneva, the world-renowned city of peace, in the evening. This is where the League of Nations meets. It has mountains and lakes, and its beauty does not yield to West Lake, and the climate is warm and pleasant. People say that Switzerland's scenery is the best in the world, and it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>(August 20) After breakfast, we took a special car and asked a guide to take us to see the sights. It was very interesting to listen to their explanations. Reading the newspaper, the Japanese team was defeated by a score of sixteen to one in Zurich, which shows the strength of Swiss football. Fortunately, we cheered up today and worked hard, and we won by a score of three to two. I personally scored three goals, and defender Dasheng performed the best. It was a rare and commendable victory in our European tour. We were treated to a feast by the local overseas Chinese, and we dispersed happily.</p>
<p>(August 21) At 9:00, we heard the sound of wheels again, heading towards Paris. We had been traveling and racing every day, and we were too tired. As soon as the car started, all the members were dreaming in their bunks, looking haggard, truly a pitiful team. We arrived in Paris at 6:30 in the afternoon. Those who welcomed us at the station included the ambassador's representative, the French government's sports minister, and many people from the overseas Chinese community. It was very lively and touching. Paris is the world's most romantic city, with a sea of ​​desire and a flesh market. The city is open all night, and its licentiousness is even more rampant than other cities in Europe. I had heard people say this before, but I did not dare to believe it. Now that I have seen it with my own eyes, I know that there is such a strange situation in the world.</p>
<p>(August 22) French professional football started four years ago, and most of the top players are hired from abroad. Its strength is quite strong. Today, we competed against them and performed wonderfully, resulting in a tie of two to two, which is also a good result. After the game, people from the French football club even asked me if I was interested in staying in France to play football, saying that they would offer me a signing bonus of 30,000 francs and a monthly salary of 2,500 francs. I declined with a smile because I am getting older and will soon retire. However, it is a happy thing that my football skills have attracted the attention of the professional world.</p>
<p>(August 23) Last night, I suddenly suffered from diarrhea. This morning, our team left for Le Havre, France, to compete. I could not accompany them due to my illness. Afterwards, I heard that everyone performed very poorly and was defeated by a score of six to zero. My absence must have had a significant impact.</p>
<p>(August 24) In the morning, I went to buy an airplane ticket because I will be flying to Sweden tomorrow to visit industrial and commercial enterprises. In the afternoon, I attended a tea party hosted by the embassy. In the evening, I went with a friend to watch nude dancing, which was bizarre and colorful, opening my eyes to a new world. Even someone who is indifferent to this would open their eyes wide.</p>
<p>(August 25) At 7:00 in the morning, I took a plane to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, because I work for a Swedish trading company and had to take some time to visit the head office and investigate the industry and commerce. The plane flew for eight hours before safely arriving at its destination. Along the way, we passed through Belgium, Germany, Denmark, and other places. Overlooking Europe, it was particularly interesting. Sweden is celebrating peace everywhere. Everyone lives and works in peace, like in a peach blossom garden, which is completely different from Paris.</p>
<p>(August 29) In recent days, I have traveled around Sweden, visiting famous cities and scenic spots, and visiting many industrial and commercial enterprises, which has increased my knowledge a lot. I have been very popular everywhere. Every time I arrive at a place, my photos are published in the newspapers, and it is considered a great regret that our team could not come to Sweden to compete. Today, I started my return journey to London from Gothenburg (Swedish coast). While passing through the capital of the Netherlands, a flight attendant told me that our team had lost to them in a light battle the previous night by a score of five to three. At 5:00 in the afternoon, I safely arrived in London. London is the world's largest city, with a vast area and a population of eight million. The traffic is complicated. Our team had already arrived here from the Dutch capital last night. Today, we were invited to visit a professional football game. Unfortunately, when I arrived at the stadium, the game was over. Fortunately, I was able to shake hands with Mr. James and others in the changing room, fulfilling a lifelong wish, which made me very happy. After reuniting with my comrades, I was invited to visit the night scenery in the South City, which I found quite interesting. There will be two games here, both against the amateur champion team, the results of which will be reported later. Also, our team will leave London for Italy early on September 2nd and take the Conte Rosso on the 4th to return to China. We should arrive in Hong Kong by September 24th. (September 2nd) On August 31st, we narrowly lost to the Corinthians team by a score of two to three, earning unlimited praise. Ji Liang and I were the most popular. On September 1st, we lost to the Casuals team again by a score of two to five. Our football games have now come to an end. We are preparing to go to Italy today and take a boat to return home.</p>
<h3>First Sound of a Football Friendly Match Today, Tung Wah Fights Portugal at 3:30 PM at the Municipal Sports Field</h3>
<p>The Tung Wah football team has been completely renewed since it changed the Municipal Sports Field to its home field this season. Now, to practice, they will play a friendly match against the strong Western team of Portugal at the Municipal Sports Field at 3:30 PM this afternoon, marking the beginning of this season and the first game at the Municipal Sports Field. Tickets are divided into three types: one yuan, six jiao, and three jiao. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation Problems</p>

<p>Wonderful Match</p>
<p>Since Cao Qiusheng left Tung Wah this season, Wan Xianghua has replaced him. Sun Jia has not returned from attending the World Games and will not be able to make it to the first game, so Tung Wah has had to enlist more people to replace him in the A-League lineup. Since Wan Xianghua was punished by the Western Union, he has only recently regained his qualifications to enter the field. The old horse knows the way, which doubles his courage. Other new additions to Tung Wah's lineup this season include Yi Chen in the center and Wen Xiu on the right wing. Today's game against Portugal is a test of their future progress. Although this game is a friendly match, its nature is very important. The Portuguese were a strong team in the middle and upper ranks last year, and they will definitely fight hard today. It can be said with certainty that the game will be exciting and tense. Tung Wah's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Ning Feng Yunyou</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang Li Yichen Shu Shigeng</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Xu Wenkui Dai Linjing Zhang Jinhai Xue Wenxiu</p>
<p>(Reserves) Guan Xunan Zhuang Youren Chen Gongyu</p>
<h3>Today's Lawn Tennis Singles and Doubles Finals Doubles to Have an Intense Battle Starting at 2:45 PM Carson Should Have No Problem Winning the Singles Championship</h3>
<p>The open doubles and advanced singles finals organized by the Lawn Tennis Association are scheduled to be held at the association's court on Avenue Joffre starting at 2:45 PM today (Saturday). Both will be best-of-five sets. The open doubles semi-finals were played the day before yesterday. As a result, Mees and Stokes were indeed no match for Carson and Squair, losing in straight sets. Lin Baohua and Defu, of course, made Forbes and Mermon, an old pair, succumb. The result was also straight sets. Today, Linde and Cass will meet, and there will definitely be a very exciting contest. Since Defu and Bonaventure were miserably defeated by Carson and Squair in the previous week's Rober Cup, the reputation of the Cass doubles has suddenly increased, causing tennis enthusiasts to be very concerned about Lin Baohua and Defu. In advanced singles, since Baohua was miserably defeated in the semi-final week, it has become a battle between Carson and Colassa. According to past situations, Ke is definitely no match. However, today, Carson must first attend the doubles, and after fighting five sets, he will give Colassa an excellent opportunity. Ke is known as a slow, steady player, and his skills are not weak. Today, he will have a lot of advantages by waiting for work. Tickets are only one yuan, and the order is as follows:</p>
<p>Starting at 2:45 PM</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Defu vs. Carson Squair Open Doubles Final</p>

<h3>Cultivation of Youth and Guidance in Various Subjects</h3>
<p>Order Issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties, stating that youth students are the backbone of the country and society. In this extraordinary period, they must have the greatest preparation and effort to shoulder the important responsibility of saving the country and reviving the nation. Although there are many ways to prepare and make efforts, the most fundamental and essential is the cultivation of self-reliance. The way to cultivate self-reliance is, on the one hand, to cultivate character and establish a foundation for being a person, and on the other hand, to study knowledge in various subjects and enhance the power of service. Only with excellent character and rich scientific knowledge can one become a sound citizen and win the final victory in the national self-salvation struggle. However, young people have undetermined consciousness and little experience. Although they have the desire to work hard and improve, they still need active guidance to strengthen their will and expand their experience, so that they can use their efforts more economically and achieve greater results, and achieve the full success of self-reliance cultivation. The Department, in view of this, in addition to having formulated the "Methods for High School Students to Establish Aspirations" and issued it in Instruction No. 2584, has specially engaged experts to separately formulate the "Main Points for Guidance on Youth Cultivation" and the "Main Points for Guidance on the Study of Various Subjects for Middle School Students in Jiangsu Province," including Chinese, English, Mathematics, History and Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Art, and other subjects. In addition, there are also "Main Points for Guidance on General Studies," totaling ten types, which have been reviewed and completed by the Department separately, printed into a book, and ordered to be issued to various schools for implementation. When implementing the "Main Points for Guidance on the Study of Various Subjects," each school should refer to the research results of the relevant subjects of the Middle School Normal School Teaching Research Association. If there are any opinions, they should be reported separately before the end of the semester, so that they can be revised and supplemented in the future. In addition to separate orders, the above-mentioned "Main Points for Guidance on Cultivation and Study" in 10 types, totaling 0 books, are hereby issued, and the head of the bureau is ordered to comply and forward them to all secondary schools under its jurisdiction for compliance. This order.</p>
<h3>New Offerings of Zhejiang University This Year</h3>

In terms of quantity, the existing talent and equipment of Zhejiang University can accommodate 1,000 students. Considering the large number of freshmen applicants this year, the number of students should be increased in the future. However, school facilities must be increased and transformed. In terms of quality, regarding newly hired professors, there are Mei Guangdi, head of the Department of Foreign Languages ​​of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, professors Lin Tianlan, Chen Xinheng, and the head of the Department of Education, which was originally concurrently held by Dean Zheng.

Except for the Faculty of Agriculture, the school buildings are all dilapidated, and places such as dormitories, sanatoriums, libraries, and physics rooms must be transformed. However, this year's budget has been established, and it is planned to propose a certain amount from temporary expenses for urgent construction. Starting from this academic year, it is stipulated that each student should have two extracurricular sports in addition to the regular physical education class, and actively advocate the development of sports habits for all teachers and students in the school. The Training Department has been newly established, with Director Jiang Zhenmin, and Sun Yachen and Chen Baiqing jointly presiding over it. It is also planned to invite deans, department heads, and professors to jointly bear the cost of training, in order to cultivate personality and return to goodness and beauty. In terms of publications, it is planned to publish a journal and organize an editorial department to take charge of it. The weekly magazine has recently been changed to a daily magazine, and news is transmitted faster.

<h3>Securities The Relationship Between Chip Supply and Demand Bond Market Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange had a slightly livelier atmosphere on the trading floor due to the near expiry of the ninth-term futures, with some swapping by both long and short sides. The market price can also be considered firm. It is more of a matter of chip supply and demand rather than rising due to the political situation, and it has been slightly squeezed up. The number of accounts is therefore decreasing, and the future is not expected to have much wave. The trend should still not be able to leave the rotating situation too late. In the morning, the opening was relatively firm. No. 10, No. 43 and No. 47 were all bought, and although the market price rose by only about 10 cents, the trend was quite consistent. The rotation was weak, and the prices all returned by 5 cents to 10 cents. In the afternoon, trading was livelier for Type B Yiqi, but the rest was scarce. Both rounds of trading were very flat, with most having no rise or fall, and a few rising by 5 cents to 10 cents. The stagnation of the market price seems to have been carefully considered, and there is nothing to add or subtract. Therefore, transactions on the trading floor often competed at the micro-number of 2.5 cents, which can also be considered a rare situation. As a result, the market price was up 20 cents for Type A this month, while the rest were consistently up 5 cents to 10 cents. Type E had no rise or fall. 96 This month actually rose to a new high price of 10.02 yuan, which is nothing more than a blind man riding a blind horse, a chaotic state of affairs. The 10 yuan mark will inevitably be broken. The total number of transactions was 6,385,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Hardware, Tin and Iron Sales are Good</h3>

It is reported that as many as four or five hundred boxes were sold yesterday, primarily by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market's Ordinary Fluctuations are Limited</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, the situation is stable, and it will probably remain in a state of fluctuation. However, yarn merchants' sales are still healthy, and confidence is good. There is still a tendency among the industry to reduce yarn holdings, leaning towards multiple directions. However, when prices rise sharply, foreign firms also release their holdings, so the market enters a state of hovering.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Barely Five Cents</p>
<p>In the opening session of the cotton yarn exchange, following the momentum from the previous day, prices continued to rise by five cents this month. However, as the trading progressed to distant months, the market became peaceful and remained static. Trading volume was sparse, with buyers and sellers evenly matched. After the second session, the market weakened. Wang Taixing, Rui Da, Geng Feng, and Fu Kang did not sell, prices gradually declining, but the drop was very slight. By the close, it was reported that there were still over eight hundred bales of spot yarn traded. The market slightly rebounded a few cents. Jin Chang, He Xing, Chang Yu, and Shen Ji bought in. As a result, all months closed down by three, four, or five cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session opened well, but the second and third sessions declined again. Trading was very narrow, and sentiment was ordinary. By the close, due to still substantial spot yarn business, there was a slight rebound. As a result, prices for all months were similar to the morning close. Sales were reported as Yu Ji 1,150 bales, Heng Yi 1,450 bales, Da Feng 1,450 bales, Zhen Da 1,200 bales, Geng Feng 1,450 bales, Rui Da 1,350 bales, Wang Taixing 1,500 bales, Fu Kang 1,000 bales, and Tong He 800 bales. Purchases were He Yu 2,750 bales, Jin Chang 1,100 bales, Yu Da 900 bales, Xing Chang 1,350 bales, Chang Yu 1,100 bales, Shen Ji 1,400 bales, Xin Cheng 900 bales, and Tai Chang 800 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Good</p>
<p>A total of 1,512 bales were traded throughout the day, with selling prices similar to the previous day. The purchase volume for each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Tianjin 200 Guangdong 300 Shantou 40</p>
<p>Inland 730 Changsha 10 Yunnan 40</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Nanjing 2 Hankou 155</p>
<h3>New Cotton Shipments Not Yet Smooth</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, mainly because the supply from various sources is not abundant, and factories are still eager for new cotton. Shipments from production areas are not smooth due to the firm and high selling prices of spot cotton. Recent short covering activity has pushed up market prices. However, overseas cotton markets are ordinary.</p>
<p>Recent Short Covering Especially Active</p>
<p>In the opening session of the cotton exchange, due to a slight increase in American cotton of one to five points and mixed Indian cotton with fluctuations between 0.25 and 0.75 rupees, and a decline in Osaka's Sanpin cotton of 1.5 to 2 cents, market sentiment was mediocre. Prices for various months were mixed, fluctuating by five points. However, later Heng Yi, Rui Da, Da Feng, Xin Cheng, Sheng Yuan, Tong He, and Da Chang started selling, causing a mid-session drop of ten to one cent. By the third close, because factories were vigorously seeking new cotton and there were no surplus arrivals, a certain person shorted October cotton, causing it to rise, pulling up distant months. Da Fu, He Xing, Xin Chang, Ju Xing, Feng Tai, Shen Ji, Yong Da, and others also bought heavily. As a result, prices for various months rose or fell by five points to 1.5 cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session opened with an unusually calm market and very little trading. As a result, prices for various months fell by one to 1.5 cents compared to the morning close. Sales were Heng Yi 4,800 piculs, Da Feng 3,300 piculs, Zhen Da 1,900 piculs, Chang Ji 1,200 piculs, Rui Da 7,400 piculs, Chang Feng 1,200 piculs, Da Chang 1,300 piculs, Tong He 7,600 piculs, Yuan Xing Chang 1,100 piculs, Xie Cheng 1,000 piculs, and Tong Ji 1,000 piculs. Purchases were Da Fu 9,900 piculs, Ji Feng 1,100 piculs, Ju Xing 1,800 piculs, Yu Da 2,600 piculs, He Yu 5,900 piculs, Chang Yu 1,900 piculs, Feng Tai 1,500 piculs, Shen Ji 3,400 piculs, Yong Da 1,600 piculs, and Xin Chang 2,100 piculs. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Selling Prices Firm and High</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still considered good, with factories all having demand. Arrivals at the docks: Yao cotton 3,324 bales, offered at prices similar to the previous day. Tong cotton 280 bales, offered at 49.2 to 49.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Yao cotton 34.80 (per catty), Yong An Factory purchased 3,500 bales, weighed at the docks.</p>
<p>Fire Machine cotton 4.00, another 1,000 bales, spot delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Another 44.00, Shen Xin Factory purchased 2,000 bales.</p>
<p>Lingbao cotton 3.25, Feng Tian Factory purchased 1,200 pieces.</p>
<p>Sha Shi cotton 20.50, Da Feng Factory purchased 56 pieces.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Morning Buying Interest Very Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with lively and firm conditions. Prices for all months rose by four to seven points. The morning Liverpool news was good. Dealers and foreign firms bought in. Simultaneously, the trend was uncertain, and buying interest was very strong. However, as hedging sales increased, it softened again. The close was firm. Spot prices rose by one point, and futures prices rose by one to six points. British cotton spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose by two to three points. Indian cotton initially firmed due to short covering, but then declined due to European exporters selling Oomra and Pingguo Er. Pingguo Er fell by 0.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 0.25 rupees, and White Luoqi rose by 0.75 rupees. Telegram on the left (dated 17th).</p>
<p>Pingguo Er 155.50, down 0.25, 28.50</p>
<p>Oomra 196.75, up 0.25, 35.20</p>
<p>White Luoqi 120.00, up 0.75, 40.00</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 18th was: White Luoqi 219.5 rupees, down 0.5 rupees; Oomra 196 rupees, down 0.75 rupees; Pingguo Er 155 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 18th regarding mixed gains and losses in Sanpin yarn and cotton: Sanpin yarn futures fell by 0.1 yuan to rising by 0.5 yuan, with the near month at 216.6 yuan and the distant month at 203.9 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 0.1 yuan to falling by 0.15 yuan, with the near month at 65.25 yuan and the distant month at 64.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Spot Flour Bargain Sales, Flour Futures Near Weak, Far Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, showed a near weak and far steady trend for all months. Regarding foreign wheat quotes, Chicago was good by 0.23 yuan and Canada was good by 0.34 yuan. When prices were quoted, near months, due to poor actual sales, spot flour offerings, whether standard or non-standard, were all lower than the current standard market price by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan (for out-of-town customers; it would be less for those within the city). Therefore, near month prices were lower by an additional 0.01 yuan. Months below December, because foreign wheat was still good, actually rose by 0.01 yuan. When the afternoon session opened, trading turned quiet, and the market was hovering. However, this factory's flour, to cater to improved customer sales, with delivery in Tianjin, was only offered at 3.25 yuan. It was said that tens of thousands of bags were opened. Therefore, considering the actual situation, the firmness of standard flour is only swayed by sentiment.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales Sluggish, Wheat Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, in the morning opening, was generally calm for all months. Because Chicago and Canada both rose by 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 yuan, and Liverpool was down slightly, after the prices were quoted, sales for all months were not brisk, fluctuating by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, trading was brisker, and the market softened. Because spot flour sales were not active, wheat market sentiment was difficult to boost. Prices for all months fell by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the morning. The spot wheat market, high-quality goods remained stable, while medium quality goods were slightly weaker. Currently, spot flour is being offered at bargain prices privately, while the wheat market remains firm. Raw materials are expensive, and finished goods are cheap, which is quite perplexing. Shandong Yingzhou wheat opened at 5.1 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Yao Wan wheat was 5 yuan, secondary grade 4.96 yuan. Sha He Ji wheat was 5.03 yuan. Dongtai wheat was 4.87 yuan, secondary grade 4.81 yuan. Gaoyou and Liuhe wheat were 4.9 yuan. Jiangbei wheat was 4.77 yuan, down 0.075 yuan. Shaoxing wheat was 4.09 yuan, purchased by Fu Xin at 6,000 bags and Shen Da at 1,400 bags.</p>
<h3>Dongxin Indica Rice Arrivals Scarce, Price Increased by 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various groups arrived on the 14th and 15th, totaling over 3,000 dan. Retail sales remained sluggish, with only the Qingdao group purchasing over 300 bags. Therefore, the prices of thick and thin japonica rice remained the same. However, Dongxin japonica rice lacked aroma, and prices increased by 0.2 yuan. The appearance of short-grain rice resembling new japonica rice was also tight. As shipments of Yangjian rice were abundant, sales were also sluggish, leading to a soft trend. Yinbianyuan rice maintained its normal state.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various groups in Hexia were on the 41st and 42nd. Sales of various types of rice on the market were still good. Market prices were stable for broken japonica rice, thin indica rice, new customer top-grade rice, new port top-grade rice, Yinbianyuan rice. New Yangtuan and Dujian rice were firm. West japonica rice was scarce, and prices were slightly tight. Dongxin japonica rice prices increased by 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Sales to Guangdong Resume Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was said that over 20,000 bags were handled... The market immediately showed signs of improvement. Yesterday, new arrivals of Ke Xian rice were still active. The supply from the Yangtze River route was continuous. Before the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was fully open, Guangdong province's purchases were still mainly based on the Shanghai market. Yesterday, Guangdong merchants' purchasing interest was even stronger. It was said that 21,400 bags of brown rice were handled from various routes in Hankou, Jinggang, Shashi, and Nanjing. With strong sales to Guangdong, the market immediately showed signs of improvement. The Shantou group and local merchants also briskly handled Gan and Xiang machine-milled rice. The Beiyang and Yongbo groups also had a touch of 200 to 300 bags. Market sentiment was quite strong, and prices also improved by 0.04 to nearly 0.1 yuan. A total of 3,130 bags of Gan rice, 1,715 bags of Xiang machine-milled rice, 6,000 bags of rough Jinggang rice, 15,000 bags of Shashi and Hankou rice, and 100 bags of Taiwan Xian rice were opened.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Factory Prices Higher, Silk Market Transactions Less</h3>
<p>Recently, the international silk market has been fluctuating. Yesterday, the American market opened with prices all rising sharply. Yokohama spot prices surged by 20 yuan, futures prices rose by 14 yuan, and New York's Rihua silk prices all rose by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The spot price for standard 20/22 denier, 7/8 evenness striped silk rose by 0.035 yuan, and the futures price rose by 0.045 yuan. As a result, local sentiment became stronger, and factory prices increased by 40 to 50 yuan, leading to smaller transactions. Yesterday, some Sichuan grey silk was sold off, and prices rose.</p>
<h3>Recent Conditions in the Sino-American Silk Markets: US Consumption Increased Last Month, Inventories Decreased; Local Silk Market Domestic Sales Brisk, Export Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Last month's US raw silk statistics report showed that consumption was 42,016 dan, an increase of over 5,300 dan compared to July. Inventories were 29,825 dan, a decrease of over 300 dan compared to the previous period, forming a situation of increased consumption and weak inventories. Based on last year's statistics (see attached table), it is projected that this month's consumption will gradually increase by 10% to 15%. As a result, sellers are unwilling to sell, so silk prices are firm, and the market is very quiet, creating opportunities for artificial silk to be active. It is heard that small merchants in New York are very interested in Shanghai 20-22 denier, yellow-white factory silk, but the quantity of this silk is not large. The Shanghai silk market, due to many speculators, is in a state of sluggish exports and brisk domestic sales. The price of 20-22 denier, 7/8 evenness striped silk has risen by about 20 to 30 yuan. It is also learned that New York bedding factories can maintain their silk usage in October and have no urgent need to purchase. Silk prices may temporarily weaken slightly.</p>
<p>US Raw Silk Statistics for 1935 August - October</p>
<p>August 1935 September October</p>
<p>Consumption 41,175 45,156 48,167</p>
<p>Imports 46,442 46,455 56,264</p>
<p>Inventories 37,381 38,680 46,777</p>
<h3>Fine Eyebrow Pearl Tea Slightly Moving</h3>
<p>Yesterday's green tea market was still quiet. Only Tong Fu, Bao Chang, Hua Tea, Yong Fa, and other firms in the city purchased a total of over 400 boxes of Fine Eyebrow Pearl Tea. The market price for plucked bud Fine Eyebrow has fallen to within 100 yuan, and the price for Luzhuang Pearl Tea has fallen to 70 yuan, a further decrease of 7 to 8 yuan compared to the previous period. Regarding Qimen black tea, after the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Sales Office planned to promote overall sales, Yihe, Xiehe, Jinlong, and other firms were very attentive yesterday. It is heard that telegrams have been sent, and Chinese and foreign parties are currently in negotiations.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market yesterday was no different from before, and transactions were very quiet. Only various plucked bud Fine Eyebrow teas continued to have sporadic transactions by Tong Fu, Hua Tea, Bao Chang, and other firms. After Gong Xi gradually reduced its selling price, Baotou Bank's purchases were still considered uneasy, and there were quite a few transactions recently. Other Fine Eyebrow and Ping Shui teas, etc., remained silent.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Demand from Various Routes Greatly Increased, Factory Cloth Insufficient for Allocation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn and cotton cloth markets were both peaceful. Japanese white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and other goods, another 2,000 pieces were opened in bulk within the last three days. Because the output number is not prosperous, the intention is very firm. Fine twill, which had been shelved, has recently seen a large increase in demand from dyeing factories, and spot goods have been completely taken away. For example, the existing stock of 300 pieces of Longtou fine twill was cleared out within three days. The Guangdong group is urging shipment of this twill very urgently. Changzhou factories' output for Guangdong orders accounts for 70%. This factory's 16-pound coarse cloth for the Yantai group, orders placed last month from Dasheng, Qingfeng, and other factories that have not yet been delivered, still amount to over 300 bags. Only a dozen bags can be allocated each day. The allocation of fancy goods is even more difficult due to the larger number of ordered items and more customers. The factories' output is limited, making allocation difficult, and the situation is worsening day by day. Customer replenishment, Tianjin group and Northwest Shaanxi group, and other assistance announced peacefully. The Guangdong group, Yunnan group, and Hankou Luzhou groups need to add additional laborers. Local merchants' sales have improved due to increased storefront business, and purchasing interest continues to be healthy. Yueque recently established a Private Inspection Committee. Yesterday, Fujian merchants stationed in Shanghai investigated various manufacturers' products for private inspection registration.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Black Watermelon Seeds Production Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dacheng Express: Lin Huai Guan and Wuhe watermelon seeds currently have hoarding households continuing to handle them, and purchase prices have risen by another half yuan. Xu Kui seeds and Tizhuang seeds have also risen by several jiao, and the market situation is quite tight.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Transactions Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend remained stable. Domestically produced Qing and Red sugars were particularly firm. The association set the price of No. 24 coarse granulated white spot at 21.55 yuan, and re-export at 6.6 yuan. No. 489 Dong White spot and re-export goods were both called at the original price. This factory's cotton white, Zhen Ji, Jin Xin, Da Hua, and other brands remained unchanged. There were Chao group openings for Huanggang Qing 300 bags at 14.5 yuan, and cotton red 140 bags, Cai Ji at 14.8 yuan, and Yaosheng at 14.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Joint venture company, yesterday was the third tender for Guangdong sugar this week, with a total quota of over 11,000 bags. Tender prices were unchanged. Shunde Factory's Jiu Mu coarse white 1,067 bags were sold at 21.4 yuan. Shi Xin Factory's another 270 bags at 21.2 yuan. Another relatively low 625 bags at 21 yuan. Qu Xi Factory's another 10 bags at 21 yuan. Another relatively secondary 100 bags at 20.7 yuan. Shi Zhong Sha White 50 bags at 19.3 yuan. A total of 2,122 bags were transacted.</p>
<h3>Sea Treasures: Shark Fin Stacks Tax Increase, Price Increase; Fish Maw Scarce, Concerned about Firmness</h3>
<p>(Shark Fin Stacks) Since the customs import tax was increased from the third class to the second class, the cost of goods has been calculated to be high, and the existing stock in various stores on the market is thin. Moreover, the Sichuan-Hankou group's sales are healthy, leading to a shortage of goods and rising sales prices. The current market price for High Longxu Stacks is 620 to 630 yuan, and those with more flexible feet are also sold for 570 to 580 yuan. Jinshan Xiaodan Stacks are 500 yuan. Other goods such as Silver Silk, Sanyu, and Wuyang are currently out of stock.</p>
<p>(Fish Maw) Arrivals from various producing areas are scarce, both new and old. Local market prices are gradually increasing. New Dadu was sold for 140 yuan, old goods for 130 yuan, Yangshan Tip-Cut Dadu for 165 yuan, Wenzhou goods for 140 yuan, and Tip-Cut Dadu for 130 yuan. Benchang Dadu is out of stock, Yuangan Ning Zhamian Glue is 135 yuan, Chaoshen is 120 yuan, and Wenzhou Glue is 100 yuan. The market is tight, and there may be further price increases later.</p>
<h3>Human and Non-Human</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>From the entirety of a woman's life, it is possible to draw a vast chasm. Thus, life is divided into two parts. The first part is the virgin era, also known as the "Golden Age". During this period, like a bird in the sky, the vastness of the universe is sufficient for it to circle, the distant future fills it with endless hope, and the surrounding environment is bright, vigorous, and beautiful. The second part is the post-marriage era, with shackles and chains added layer upon layer to its body, like a bird once thrown into a net, confined to a narrow cage, suspended under a private roof. In front of it, the universe becomes narrow, the future is cut off by high walls and thick barriers. Though fortunate enough not to suffer from cold or hunger, it ultimately becomes a parasite dependent on others. When it can sing and call, and its feathers are lush, it can still be loved. But once its voice is ruined and its feathers fall out, its fate becomes uncertain.</p>
<p>To elaborate further, women live an upward, "human" life in the former era, while the latter era often subjects them to an irrational, almost "non-human" existence. The treatment received by women with or without knowledge is not essentially different, but women of the intellectual class experience a deeper sense of suffering. Until the remnants of feudalism and traditional concepts are completely eliminated, and the family system is reformed (breaking down large families into small families is still insufficient), this suffering will be unavoidable for most women.</p>
<p>When a woman is living a school life, her walk is brisk, her voice is loud, her ambitions are far-reaching, and her aspirations are grand. She refuses to show weakness to anyone, and does not easily utter a word of apology. Most of her thoughts are connected to society and the masses. This is a rational and commendable "human" life. During this period, some women with ideals and ambitions taste the experience of a non-human life, and vow to eliminate the irrational non-human life, wanting to be a female revolutionary to bring happiness to women all over the world. However, once they step into this living environment, their minds and vision are narrowed by "worldliness" and "habit," the pride of their virgin era completely disappears, and they involuntarily sink into "submission," forever unable to raise their heads!</p>
<p>In the world, for every man who seeks to praise women, there is an equal number of men who regard women as "objects in their palms." Are men human and women not human? Why can women only endure, submit, and live under the existing non-human conditions?</p>
<h3>Biographies of Famous Women in the World (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Rusabai</p>
<p>Karuikina and Ardusina both came from poor families. Her father was a poor peasant in the Tuva region. At the age of nine, she was doing many arduous jobs and looking after children for others. But she did not look like someone who had suffered from hunger and cold, but rather like a majestic strongman. She participated in the revolution at a young age. When she was fifteen or sixteen, working in chemical factories and textile factories, she encouraged workers to strike and vigorously promoted revolutionary work. In several domestic uprisings, she bravely went in and out of the hail of bullets to command the masses, truly worthy of being a female hero.</p>
<p>She is only forty years old this year, and her physique and energy are very vigorous. She is currently an alternate member of the Central Committee and serves as the secretary of the local party committee.</p>
<p>Although she holds important positions in the party, in order to enrich her mind and acquire abundant knowledge, she worked hard at Moscow's Sverdlov University for three years and finally achieved her goal, gaining the praise of fellow comrades in the Party Central Committee. Her future development is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Karuikina</h3>
<p>Equal in prominence to alternate member Karuikina is Rosalia Zemlyachka, controller of the Soviet Union. She was born in 1876. She had already participated in the revolutionary movement before Karuikina was born, so in terms of age, among the general female revolution participants, she can be considered a veteran.</p>
<p>Except for the Fifth Party Congress, which she did not attend due to imprisonment, she attended every Party Congress. She served as the secretary of the Party Committee during the First Revolution in 1905 and the Second Revolution in 1917. She was a close friend of Plekhanov, Ilyich, and other pioneer revolutionaries. She worked in various places in European Russia, including St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Baku for a long time. Her reputation is above that of Kollontai and she is respected by the general public.</p>
<p>She is a calm and passionate person. In calm, the person's spirit is divided very finely. After the Red Army occupied Crimea, she gained fame for handling the local Crimean party counter-revolutionary base. She reorganized Crimea into the Soviet Crimea it is now. This is her greatest achievement. In short, she has a very long history in the Soviet Party. Now she is over sixty years old. Although she has no major political development in the future, as an elder of the Bolsheviks, the Federal Government expresses its respect for her and has awarded her the Red Banner and Lenin awards.</p>

<h3>The Side Hustle of Fisherwomen on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>People living in Shanghai probably don't know that there are such miserable women in the Huangpu River. When foreign ships dock or leave port, because the ships are huge and difficult to maneuver, it often takes a long time, two or three hours. At this time, the entire ship of passengers stands on the deck's edge, looking at relatives and friends on shore. Two or three small boats desperately row close to the ships. Most of the boats have one man and one woman, husband and wife or father and daughter, rowing long paddles with both hands, skimming across the yellow turbid water. Although they manage to row close to the ship, because the iron plate hull is smooth and impossible to climb, they are soon pushed away by the waves, and they have to continue to row closer again.</p>
<p>It seems like the fishing boats on the Huangpu River, but this is just a desperate side hustle. The man stands on the stern of the small boat, rowing the paddle to keep the boat from drifting away from the edge of the ship. The woman puts down the paddle and stands on the bow, holding a bamboo pole more than two fathoms long, with a small fishing net tied to the end of the pole. She uses all her strength to raise the scorching net to the edge of the deck, her face already flushed red. Swaying on the constantly rocking boat, "Hello! Money (the English word for money)!" she keeps shouting upwards, using her only English. She also frees a pair of hands, pointing at the young children on the boat, and raising her hand to her forehead, giving a salute. "Hello! Money!" Several charitable passengers throw some coins into her net. She barely endures the headache, looking up and shouting. Until the ship begins to move, she only gets a few jiao. Of course, there are also those who don't get a single cent. The woman's moaning is easier to win people's sympathy. The reason why the man rows in the back and lets the woman take on this tail-wagging, begging act is probably to exploit this psychology. But if they encounter stingy passengers, who only point and give contemptuous smiles, or take pictures of them as souvenirs of their trip to China, what can they do?</p>
<p>The sailors on the ship and the workers on the dock try their best to stop them because they are hindering their work. A sailor on the ship grabs her fishing net, and her body is about to be lifted into the air. The two people below bitterly plead. The sailors on the dock break their ropes or don't allow the bamboo poles to hook onto the wharf. The small boat loses its support and rocks violently. The waves crash onto the children in the middle of the boat. The paddle and bamboo pole are both lost into the water, flowing away with the waves. They struggle desperately, still trying to retrieve what they have lost. They are so angry that they have nowhere to vent, so they curse and swear arbitrarily, until those being cursed can no longer hear their voices.</p>
<p>Special Report by this Newspaper</p>
<h3>A Record of Meeting Ms. Nie Lingyu</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession is such a large area, but besides the schools of all levels run by us Chinese ourselves, the number of primary and secondary schools established by the Public Works Department is very limited. For example, there is only one girls' middle school to date, and it has only been around for five years. The Public Works Department receives tens of millions in revenue each year, and the donations and taxes paid by us Chinese naturally account for the majority. However, the amount the department spends on Chinese education is probably still less than that spent on Western education. This is very unfair! The principal of the Public Works Department Girls' Middle School, Yang Nie Lingyu, is a woman with definite experience in running schools, and I have heard people say this for a long time. The day before yesterday evening, I finally met her for the first time. We talked for a long time and visited the entire school. Now I will introduce the information I obtained to the readers:</p>
<p>The girls' middle school is located on Singapore Road in western Shanghai, which is a very remote place, and the transportation is not convenient. The school building is a newly built three-story Western-style building, and the style is very suitable. The site is also spacious, and it is said to be modeled after the latest German-style architecture. Indeed, the light and air are more suitable than any other school, and the interior layout is even more complete than usual. For example, in addition to fixed classrooms, there are subject-specific classrooms. Each classroom has a cloakroom attached to the back. The glass windows are specially designed so that no matter how strong the wind is, it will not blow directly on the students. Even in the severe winter season, the windows can be opened as usual, and the air will naturally not be turbid. The blackboard is light green to protect the eyes. Below it is a showcase for students of each grade to place reference books. The podium is on the left, which does not obstruct the students' view. Such a large school building is silent at night. It turns out that there are more than 500 teachers and students, none of whom live at the school. Only a few caretakers are left to guard it.</p>
<p>Principal Ms. Nie is a pioneer among female students who studied abroad. When she graduated from middle school, there were no women's universities in China. At that time, men and women were not allowed to attend the same school, so she had to enter the University of Michigan in the United States, first studying mathematics and physics and obtaining a master's degree. After returning to China, she taught in Jiujiang for six years, and then went to the University of Chicago to study education. After returning, she served as the principal of Nanchang Baoling Middle School. She was considered the first Chinese woman to be appointed as the principal of a church school. In 1929, she went to the United States for the third time to investigate education, and in the autumn of 1931, she was hired to her current position. Therefore, the girls' middle school was founded by her. She has several thoughts on women's education: (1) In running education, one should do practical work and not talk in high-sounding terms; (2) Adapt to the needs of society and pay attention to science education; (3) In addition to compulsory courses, new knowledge of family life should be taught; (4) In recent years, the effectiveness of women's service to society has improved compared to the past, but it is still far behind European, American, and Japanese countries. We cannot be complacent. We hope that women's professions will be more developed, but we dare not agree with improper professions; (5) The current joint examination system is too biased. Due to the physiological and psychological differences between girls and boys, they cannot take the same exam. However, the subjects of the current joint examination are the same for both men and women, which I think should be changed.</p>
<p>She also has many commendable points regarding student training and school management. She said that before the first class every morning, students of each grade hold an oath, which reads: "Under the guidance of teachers and the encouragement of classmates, we will study hard, abide by school rules, be diligent and endure hardship, be friendly and harmonious, cultivate the spirit of daring to be enterprising, and forge a strong and healthy body; adhere to the school motto of 'not to be served, but to serve,' shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, and advance bravely towards a bright future. We hereby swear!" After two classes, there is "civic training." The method is as follows: Each grade has a teacher responsible for discipline. Every month, all teachers and students gather in one hall to listen to the principal's speech. Every other month, the teacher answers the difficult questions raised by the students of each grade. On Wednesdays, each grade discusses specialized issues. For example, the general topic of this semester is health issues, so the discussion will not go beyond the scope of health. On Thursdays, students of each grade report on current events, dividing them into international and domestic important news. On Fridays, students give speeches, divided into Chinese and English groups. On Saturdays, famous people are invited to give speeches. This cycle repeats, giving students more extracurricular intellectual activities. As for the school management policy, there are roughly four points: (1) To cultivate students' sound physique and unique personality; (2) The students of our school all come from middle- and upper-class families, so we must train them to be leaders, so that they can go on to university or serve the society and family; (3) Home economics is important, but practical guidance is also needed on how to serve society; (4) To train them to value morality and cultivate the spirit of diligence and endurance. We dare not expect too much, but we hope to achieve our limited goals.</p>
<h3>Ms. Nie Lingyu</h3>
<p>Finally, she has two opinions on modern women:</p>
<p>(A) Cultivate a healthy body:</p>
<p>(1) Do not consider delicate beauty as feminine beauty</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to personal hygiene, family hygiene, childbearing, and public health;</p>
<p>(3) Develop a balanced body and a strong physique, and then establish a good foundation in technology and knowledge.</p>
<p>(B) Should have a thorough awareness:</p>
<p>(1) Shoulder the task of national revival—uphold the spirit of mutual assistance to establish oneself and help others, and to serve society;</p>
<p>(2) Apply the skills learned—most urban women today are immersed in the enjoyment of pleasure, forgetting their own responsibilities. Even if they have knowledge and skills, they do not apply them in practice, completely burying themselves within the scope of the family, or submitting to the service of their husbands and children, or even indulging in dancing and banquets. This is an extreme mistake. We women should apply our skills beyond the scope of the family.</p>
<p>In short, we must have a spirit of hard work and cope with China's current extraordinary period, and always have the determination to sacrifice for the benefit of the public in order to realize the important task of national defense for women.</p>
<h3>Women's Life in Taixian County</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yunxun</p>
<p>Although this describes the life of women in Taixian County, it can actually include the eight counties under Yangzhou. It is one of the first places to be influenced by the Jiangnan style, but the local customs and human feelings are largely the same with minor differences. My writing about women's life in Taixian County also represents the eight counties under Yangzhou. They don't know what "women's movement" is, and those who have been educated and washed by the new tide of thought account for less than 5%. Being able to hum two lines of the seven-character verses of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and read two pages of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Biography of Ji Gong is considered knowledgeable and courteous. They have no extravagant hopes. In their hearts and minds, they only want to win the four-character award of "exemplary mother" and "preserved female virtues" in the future, and they will be happy to smile in the afterlife. Now, let me divide it into three stages based on my imagination.</p>
<p>The first stage is the so-called 5% of school graduates, who mostly have only junior high school and some normal school education. They do not seek economic independence. They are pampered at home and become young mistresses when they marry. Most of them are the wives of committee members, lawyers, and young masters. Teachers are a one-in-a-thousand miracle. In short, they still cannot escape the shackles of "assisting their husbands and educating their children." They fulfill some hospitality responsibilities for their husbands' careers, which is a disguised form of domestic help. With spare time, the young mistress of the Zhang mansion attends some aimless banquets, playing mahjong eight rounds with each other, and mostly spend their years in this way.</p>
<p>The second stage of women have fairly wealthy families. Managing household affairs and raising children are the main duties of these women. Washing clothes, cooking, and fetching water are done by a maid. Young women follow their mother-in-law and assist in trivial household chores. Middle-aged women manage finances, and sometimes play a game or two of mahjong or cards for fun. Elderly women in this second stage are diligent and thrifty, taking care of tea and rice, and looking after the seven necessities of life. Otherwise, they chant Buddhist scriptures and take care of themselves in their old age. Some, who are more absurd, are addicted to small gambling dens.</p>
<p>The women in the third stage are the poorest and can represent the general life of women. Washing clothes, cooking rice and porridge, raising sons and daughters, sweeping the floor and wiping the table are all done by themselves. In short, the women here live under the shadow of "a husband's glory, a wife's nobility, and a pampered child." The families I am talking about are naturally not rich enough. They don't make their own needles, but help others sew clothes. During this transition of seasons, their only side job is to make nets. This handicraft is rarely found in Jiangnan. the yarn  with great effort and hardship, they twist it first. Then, make it a line, and then, twist it into a thread. The surgery is very hot, and one can twist one feet a day. One yuan of capital can get three yuan of goods price. The clothing and food support is not  not complement. The operation is watched on a star and eye! The spirit of taste must not be tolerated! This can only get to the micro profit.</p>
<h3>What I Learned from Interviewing Working Women: The Thoughts and Lives of Female Employees at the New Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>— Xian Ying</p>
<p>In recent years, the advancement of women's occupations in the country has shown a very rapid surge. Initially, most were primary school teachers and female workers in factories. Then, government agencies and commercial society gradually had female employees. Therefore, the investigation of the lives and the examination of the thoughts of those professional women have become a new and interesting job. What I want to describe here can be said to be the newest of many kinds of women's occupations. Perhaps two broad and extremely developed new paths are where women's occupations can be most effective in the future, that is, the hotel business.</p>
<p>On a late summer afternoon, I drove to the mysterious head of North Sichuan Road. That long snake-like row of red houses is now in front of me. In my casual wandering, I found a special job, that is, I wanted to visit a few female employees in that New Asia Hotel this afternoon.</p>
<p>Women becoming employees in the hotel business may still be rare in China, but in foreign countries, on the one hand, because of the development and importance of the hotel business, and on the other hand, because of the recognition of women's unique strengths—carefulness, harmony, patience, etc.—which are more suitable for the position of hotel clerk, women have already created a special position in the hotel business. For example, the book "Women in Hotel Business" emphasizes that women should run the hotel business, and concludes that "I believe that in a few years, women will dominate the business that they should dominate." It may well be possible!</p>
<p>Among the hotels completely run by ourselves in our country, the New Asia Hotel is definitely second to none. Manager Zhong Biao can be said to be a "national expert" in hotels. Under his management, the New Asia Hotel emphasizes the use of female employees as an important policy. Therefore, he has now hired more than a dozen female workers, who are distributed on each floor to specialize in rough work such as wiping floors, wiping windows, washing, and tidying up. As for the female employees, they are all on the ground floor, and can be roughly divided into four departments:</p>
<p>1. Information desk: Three information clerks in light red Western-style uniforms</p>
<p>2. Elevator operators: Four elevator operators in light green Western-style uniforms</p>
<p>3. Chinese restaurant waitresses: Six waitresses in light green uniforms with white aprons</p>
<p>4. Telephone switchboard operators: Six telephone switchboard operators, plus one in the cloakroom, for a total of four departments with twenty people. What I have learned from my visit now is only a case study of five representatives selected from each of their departments, those five:</p>
<p>Information desk - Miss Bao Mali</p>
<p>Elevator desk - Miss Chen Yuping</p>
<p>Chinese restaurant - Miss Zhang Peiyi</p>
<p>Telephone switchboard - Miss Su Xiuzhen</p>
<p>Chinese restaurant and elevator - Miss Chen Xiuqin</p>
<p>Their similarities are:</p>
<p>(1) They are all of Cantonese origin, and have been in Shanghai for many years, and can speak extremely fluent Cantonese, ordinary Mandarin, and English.</p>
<p>(2) The ages are all around twenty years old, differing by one or two years. Except for Mali, all are unmarried.</p>
<p>(3) The salary is between 40 and 50 yuan per month, and it is not regarded as the only income for their families. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>This publication is publishing a special issue in ten sections and is soliciting manuscripts. The ideas must be progressive and the arguments must be practical. Each article must not exceed 800 characters. The deadline for submission is the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Old Clothes</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The sky seemed to have encountered some sad event, crying there all day and night, for almost three days in a row. If it continues like this, there will inevitably be a year of flood and drought. The price of rice has risen to 18 yuan, 20 yuan per dan, and the price of tofu has also risen, and the price of meat has also risen. These are all unavoidable!</p>
<p>Wei Qing sat in the small accounting room, which was as narrow as the bottom of an escalator, looking at the sky, thinking very absentmindedly, thinking of these terrible predictions. He really couldn't continue to calculate the batch of accounts that the manager had just given him. However, the rising prices of rice and meat are still future changes, and for the time being, he can still force himself not to think about them. What is difficult is that he remembers his son Da Bao when he left home in the morning. Rui Zhu told him that Da Bao only had a decent set of clothes, which he had been wearing for a week. It was really too dirty. If he wore it to school again, it would be too embarrassing to wash it overnight. How easy is it to dry on a rainy day? So it is best to teach Wei Qing to discuss with his brother-in-law Yu Daishan to ask for one or two clean old clothes to change. Yes, the Yu family has been making a lot of money recently! I remember the last time Rui Zhu's sister, Li Zhu, brought her eldest son, Xue Ling, to Wei Qing's house, she was dressed so exquisitely! According to their accompanying servants, this child had twenty or thirty pieces of seasonal clothing in his wardrobe! And Da Bao's figure happened to be about the same as Xue Ling's, so Rui Zhu's idea of ​​coming up with this emergency solution was really very clever. However, Wei Qing thought: I can't afford to make new clothes for my son, but I go to ask people for old clothes to wear. It's really embarrassing. It's best not to go. Then buy new ones. Although it is said that there are no new ones worth two or three yuan, there are also not that much new clothes and there are only eighteen days left until the end of the month. There are only eleven yuan left at home. How can he spend such an extra sum? He planned like this for a long time, and finally he still took the rain to Yu's house, and under Rui Zhu's very embarrassing begging, he got two old clothes.</p>
<p>It was seven fifteen when he got home. Rui Zhu, Da Bao, Xi Chang, and Xiao Luo were all holding rice bowls and waiting for him. As soon as Rui Zhu saw him coming with a paper bag, she shouted with a happy expression:</p>
<p>"Okay! Da Bao's new clothes are here!"</p>
<p>Opening the paper bag, Da Bao also smiled. It turned out that all of Da Bao's own clothes were always made of cheap foreign cloth, and the styles were very old. But today, the two old clothes that Wei Qing had asked for from Yu's house were all wool, and the workmanship was exquisite, and the styles were good-looking. Da Bao felt that they were much better than the new clothes made at his own house!</p>
<p>Wei Qing and Rui Zhu were naturally very happy to see Da Bao happy, especially Xi Chang and Xiao Luo, the two younger siblings, were overjoyed.</p>
<p>The next day, Da Bao went to school, and the teacher and classmates couldn't help but take a few more glances at him. Da Bao thought in his heart that this must be because of the new clothes, and he was so happy that he couldn't be better. From then on, whether he went to school or went to the park with his father, he didn't want to wear his own clothes anymore. He had to wear the two old clothes that he had asked for from Yu's house. But if anyone asked, he always said that they were made at home, and he repeatedly told his father and mother not to tell people that they were borrowed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one day, at another relative's house, Da Bao and Xue Ling met. Xue Ling's memory was really good. As soon as he saw Da Bao, he pulled on his clothes and laughed:</p>
<p>"These are my old clothes! Your father came to ask us for them!"</p>
<p>Hearing him say this, Da Bao felt that everyone around him was laughing at him. His little face turned as red as if it had been dyed, and he finally ran to Rui Zhu's side and cried. Rui Zhu also seemed to hear people quietly saying "old clothes are borrowed", "no wonder they don't fit", "turns out they are picked up old clothes"... Under the emotion of shame and anger. The helpless mother had to escape with her poor son.</p>

<p>Scabies</p>
<h3>Twenty-Second Query, Mr. Fei Nuo asks: My younger brother suffers from scabies on his head; please recommend a medication.</h3>
<p>Answer: "Pixrol Oint-ment" can treat it.</p>
<p>Back Pain</p>
<h3>Twenty-Third Query, Mr. Lu Lin asks: (1) I have suffered from syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum. The gonorrhea cleared up early, and the syphilis has been treated for ten years, with countless injections of 606, but it never seems to be eradicated. A certain doctor at the front hall advised me to start with 0.45 and go up to 0.75, for a total of six injections, and the blood test came back clear. The doctor ordered me to have another test in six months, but I thought my illness was already cured. Why lose more blood? So I didn't go back. Last month, I suddenly had lower back pain, like a stabbing pain radiating all around, along with a headache. I ask, (1) What is the cause? (2) Is it dangerous? (3) How do I treat it? (4) Can you guarantee a cure? (5) How much does your blood test cost? (6) Can smoking opium cure it?</h3>
<p>Answer: It is the remaining toxin not cleared up, affecting the spinal cord, i.e., "spinal syphilis." This condition developed because you didn't heed the doctor's advice. Generally, a formal doctor's words are trustworthy and will not deceive you. You were stingy with five cc of blood. Know that the human body has ten pounds of blood; losing a mere five cc is like losing a single grain from the ocean. Those with healthy blood-producing organs will regenerate it in minutes. (2) The danger is worrying! (3) Inject "Arsphenamine" ("606") and the mercury preparation "Carbisin," along with other "anti-syphilis therapies." (4) It can be treated, but guaranteeing a cure goes against medical ethics; our doctor cannot comply. (5) Two yuan. (6) You are mistaken. "Opium" can only temporarily relieve pain, not treat it, and is of no benefit. "Opium" is, after all, a medicine, with a dosage and maximum limit. Even doctors must use it with great caution. How can a patient start using it at will?! You are about to fall into a bottomless pit!</p>
<p>Foreskin Ulceration</p>
<h3>Twenty-Fourth Query, Mr. SY from Chunyang Lane, Dongfang Heng Road, Hongkou asks: A week ago, I had intercourse with a woman of questionable cleanliness (whether she was unclean, I do not know). I accidentally scraped two small pieces of skin off the edge of my glans penis, one on the side and one on the lower middle. I didn't pay attention afterward and only discovered it two days later. I applied the surgical medicine "Washing Blood Mirror" (i.e., "Leng Xiang Xue"), but it didn't work. It's been a week now. The wound on the side has hardened slightly, but the wound in the lower middle shows no change. Neither wound has closed. I ask (1) What is this condition? Is there any specific medicine? (2) If I go to your clinic for treatment, what is the guaranteed cost? How long will it take to heal? How much does it cost to test for this condition? (3) Is this the condition commonly known as "chancre"? (4) What is "soft chancre"? What is "hard chancre"? (5) Are there any long-term consequences of this disease? Answer: (1) It is "soft chancre." "Haibi-form" can be applied. (2) In consideration of the sick and poor, our clinic charges 20 cents for registration in the morning and $1.20 in the afternoon, but the morning rate is limited to the truly impoverished. Guaranteeing a cure violates medical ethics; our doctor dares not comply. If left untreated, it will take four to eight weeks to heal. The condition is already clear; no further testing is needed. If a blood test is required, it must wait two weeks and costs two yuan. (3) See (1). (4) "Soft chancre" occurs on the third or fourth day after unclean intercourse and is a "streptococcal infection." "Hard chancre" occurs in the second to fifth week after intercourse and is the initial symptom of "syphilis." (5) Generally, there are no long-term consequences, but weakened patients may develop "phagedenic ulceration."</h3>
<p>Anal Lump</p>
<h3>Twenty-Fifth Query, Mr. Chen Wei from Huacheng Tobacco Factory, Dalian Bay Road, Huishan Road asks: I recently discovered a bean-sized lump near my anus, slightly painful, especially after fatigue from work each day. I have suffered from constipation for the past few years, coupled with recent sleep disturbances, so I think the cause of this illness is from this. I consulted a Western doctor, who said, "It is early-stage hemorrhoids. For now, besides self-care—i.e., avoiding overwork and eating nutritious food—there is no other medical treatment. If the condition worsens, the only option is surgery, but surgery is not worthwhile at this stage." (1) Is what the aforementioned Western doctor said completely reliable? (2) If left untreated, will this condition gradually worsen? (3) Besides surgery, is there any other reliable medical treatment for this condition? (4) If I have time, I would like to visit your doctor for examination. Does your doctor think this is necessary?</h3>
<p>Answer: (1) Reliable, but there are new treatments: hemorrhoid injection, fuming nitric acid cauterization, electrocautery, etc. (4) The Western doctor's diagnosis is accurate; there is no need for further consultation.</p>
<p>Nasal Discharge</p>
<h3>Twenty-Sixth Query, Mr. Yu Shoufang, 38 Yongyu Lane, Route Lafayette asks: I have a minor ailment. I respectfully ask for your answer: (1) My condition is the same as that of Mr. Zhang Yi (neurasthenia). I usually enjoy reading books (except medical books). I have never taken medicine before (due to financial constraints). (2) My nose smells terrible and discharges a fluid like pus. (3) I often feel dizzy, my vision blurs, and I feel like I'm about to fall. My body is very weak and prone to minor ailments. (4) Besides the root cure "Horlicks Malted Milk," is there any other way? (5) Can you provide treatment?</h3>
<p>Answer: (1) The increase in "neurasthenia" is like the increase in "nearsightedness," both are diseases of the times, tragic results of social evolution. Young people like us don't want to be left behind by the times. The goal is not wrong, only the method is wrong. Please believe that social experience can make you a modern youth, far better than books. Go out and experience current society. (2) There are many causes for a foul-smelling nasal discharge. Without examination, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. (3) It is related to both nasal and brain diseases. For brain diseases, in addition to taking "Horlicks Malted Milk," you can inject "Blusen." (5) It's best to have a consultation.</p>
<p>Menstrual Irregularity</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seventh Query, Mr. Li Muhan, Changshou Lane, Daokou Lane, Nanshi asks: My wife is in her thirties and has had two children, both over ten years old. For several years, her menstruation has been irregular, sometimes early, sometimes late (mostly late recently). During her period, she experiences leg soreness, lower abdominal distension and pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and other symptoms. Her menstrual blood is very light, occasionally with small purple clots. She feels slightly better when she presses her abdomen tightly when it hurts. I have the following questions and respectfully request your answers and guidance. (1) Is this "blood deficiency" (?), weakness, i.e., anemia? (2) Can "Bolao Pills" and "Weier Mu" cure this disease? (3) Please recommend other more suitable medications for daily use to alleviate menstrual pain! (4) What medications can strengthen her "spleen" (?) and stomach, and improve her appetite? (5) If it persists for a long time, what major physical changes might occur?</h3>
<p>Answer: (1) Based on the above description, it does not seem to be "anemia," but rather "dysmenorrhea." As for whether there are other uterine diseases, it is difficult to say without an examination. (2) "Bolao Pills" can treat anemia. I don't know what "Weier Mu" is, so I cannot comment. (3) Use "Tancno" (Dang Gui Er), half a spoonful each time, and "Tonbelin," two tablets at the same time, to achieve this goal. (4) You can use "Aectoe-Pcpoin." (5) Only after examination can it be known.</p>
<p>Scrotal Swelling</p>
<h3>Twenty-Eighth Query, Mr. Zhou Xuan, 1331 North Sichuan Road asks: I have a scrotal swelling—the left one alone is swollen like an egg (the right one is unchanged). When I get up in the morning, it feels back to normal, but after only a few minutes, it becomes large on one side again. There is no pain. I have had it for over a year. Please give me detailed guidance on the following: (1) What is the name of this condition, is it a hernia? (2) Will it affect other parts and cause changes? Will it continue to grow if left untreated? (3) What medicine or surgery should I use?</h3>
<p>Answer: (1) External inguinal hernia. (2) It can affect other parts of the body. There is a possibility of further swelling. (3) Medication cannot cure it. A hernia belt can be used (for mild cases). For severe cases, surgery may be performed. Surgical methods include the Lucas-Championnière method, the Bassini method, and the Cooper's ligament repair, etc.</p>
<p>Dizziness and Brain Fog</p>
<h3>Twenty-Ninth Query, Mr. Jiang Wei, 38 Yufei Lane, North Sichuan Road asks: Due to my job, I have to sleep between 12:00 AM or 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM every day and get up at 8:00 AM. This lifestyle lasted for four years. Now, I have been away from this lifestyle for four months, but I have become a neurasthenic. Every day after getting up, I feel dizzy and have brain fog all day long. When I shake my head, my brain makes "kak, kak, kak" sounds. When I read a little more, my brain becomes even more confused—like having a fever. At the same time, my eyes also feel tired. These symptoms started three years ago, but they were very mild at the time. I have taken several Western medicines, but none of them have worked. Now, I ask you to answer me: (1) How to treat it—the medicine should not be expensive, as my financial resources are very limited. (2) What will happen if I don't treat it? (3) Is there any danger? (4) What kind of food should I eat regularly that is beneficial for my illness? (5) How can I treat generalized sweating?</h3>
<p>Answer: Reading your letter evokes my infinite sympathy. To think that at such a young age (according to your letter, you are only eighteen years old this year, so you started working at fourteen?), you are suffering this pain, it is truly pitiful. There are capitalists in this day and age who only care about stuffing piles of banknotes into their safes and depositing them in banks, and do not hesitate to harm promising young people; it is truly infuriating. Not to boast, but in my childhood, I suffered even more economic and personal hardships than you. I even cried for three days and nights because I couldn't afford to go to school, and I also developed "neurasthenia" from studying hard. Even now, I still wear a pair of -3.00 diopter glasses. However, my "neurasthenia" was finally cured, but only after struggling out and finding a way out. However, my treatment is useless for you because the opportunities are different (I abandoned my books and traveled half of China). However, I think (1) treatment starts by eliminating the cause of your illness. Once the cause of all diseases is gone, it is easy to recover. You now have "neurasthenia." Although recovery is not as fast as with other diseases, I can guarantee that it will be greatly reduced after eight months. During this recovery period, you should pay attention to not reading, and not worrying about your illness and other things. Take some "Piu Ho-rnispermin" (Horlicks Malted Milk) pills, and that will be enough. Don't have too much faith in medicine, thinking that diseases cannot be cured without medicine. There are many modern medical treatments. (2) If you don't treat it, you will never become a person capable of great achievements. However, you should know that you are unconsciously treating it now! (3) There is no danger to life. Your illness will get better, absolutely get better, don't worry too much about it! (4) Everything you like to eat is beneficial for your illness, especially egg yolk. (5) Use some "magnesium carbonate" for dry application.</p>

<h3>The Consistent Hope of the People</h3>
<p>— Yi Wo</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, it can be said that there has not been a single day of peace. It has either been a time of internal strife or external aggression. The difficulty of such times can be described as sitting on pins and needles, or having thorns in one's back, unable to rest peacefully. However, to avoid the attack of external disasters, we must first strengthen our defenses and clear the fields, and organize internal affairs. This is the consistent view of our people, and it is also the only way to reorganize the country, which no one can deny.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the abnormal movements of Guangdong and Guangxi, under the guise of external defense, first called themselves armies. Fortunately, the central authorities saw through this point and were determined not to deal with them by force, but first showed sincerity, opened their hearts, and appealed to them with righteousness, clarifying the fortune and misfortune. Naturally, warlords who specialize in extortion were abandoned by their followers and collapsed without a fight. The serious situation in the Southwest, where the mountains were about to collapse and the wind filled the building, melted away like ice and snow in less than two months. Peace prevailed. This was the government's established national policy, and it was also the consistent hope of the people. Removing a source of disaster means preserving some vitality for the country. This is the first hope of our people.</p>
<p>With the departure of the Chen faction, Li and Bai remained. Although Guangdong had already submitted to the central government, Guangxi Province was still unable to unify. The central government spared no effort to compromise and sent senior officials to negotiate cooperation, and declared that it would never deal with them by force, but would use political means to persuade them. Li and Bai's contribution lay in the Republic of China, governing one province, and the righteousness was obvious, not to be refuted. Naturally, in a peaceful atmosphere, the situation of estrangement and obstruction that had existed for years was completely eliminated. In this way, not only did the country achieve the effect of peaceful unification, but it also gained the help of its limbs. This is the second hope of our people.</p>
<p>With the country unified, we can talk about diplomacy. Yue came to Beijing to discuss the overall situation. The name of the incident was the Chengdu Incident, but in reality, it sought to adjust the entire diplomacy. The entire negotiation and the entire adjustment were certainly welcome. Before we understand what kind of method and what kind of conditions will be used for the adjustment, it is not appropriate to judge it. However, we know that the visit of Ambassador Chuan Yue this time had a great mission and was not comparable to ordinary envoys. It is said that the Japanese authorities regarded the Chengdu Incident as a serious matter, so before Ambassador Chuan Yue came to China, the Japanese foreign, land, and naval ministers held emergency meetings many times to discuss countermeasures. Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita also met with the Emperor several times to report on the progress and countermeasures in handling this matter. The importance they attach to this matter is evident.</p>
<p>In fact, the Chengdu mass riot incident was not very serious. The details of this matter remain to be thoroughly investigated. The truth has not yet been clarified. In short, this incident was nothing more than a manifestation of the unstable situation in the Chengdu area, and unfortunately, a Japanese journalist was brutally killed during this period. Therefore, I believe that if the Japanese authorities truly want to achieve amity, they should not make a mountain out of a molehill, and should uphold the principle of turning big things into small things and small things into nothing, and discuss them peacefully and calmly in public. Perhaps this can achieve the true effect of friendship. Otherwise, the situation will become more rigid, and our country's endurance of compromise will probably have reached its limit. This is the third hope of our people.</p>
<h3>Tragedy in the Villa</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>Because it was already late when we left that small inn, we were overtaken by the hot sun when the car drove to Kaiyuan Temple. It was as if thousands of large furnaces were placed around us. "If we have to walk like this for a day, we'll turn into dried shrimp!" The old driver kept wiping his sweat and shouting. But there was something even more interesting happening: the old driver even took off his pants. He pointed to the white flesh below his stomach, which was out of sync with the rest of his body, and said, "...Hey, sir, look, even a young girl's flesh probably isn't as tender as mine!" After he said that, we all burst out laughing, and the laughter was immediately swallowed by the silence of the wilderness.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid of running into someone?"</p>
<p>"People? ...Hmph, don't worry, sir,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>You won't run into any women. What kind of woman would dare to walk in this boundless wilderness! If they run into young lads! Hahahaha... that account won't be settled... Giddy up! Whoa! ...Don't you think so! ...If we run into men, what's so rare about that? Wouldn't a laugh settle everything? ...If you can't stand the heat, you should take off your pants too. Let me tell you, sir! Politeness isn't worth anything in the countryside—if you wear a long gown and mandarin jacket, or some Western suit and tie, you might get heatstroke and go back to your grandma's!"</p>
<p>The horse was panting, and slowly walked forward.</p>
<p>It seemed that the vast land was like a round millstone. Although we were moving forward, we always seemed to be standing still in the center of the millstone. It wasn't us moving, but the land that was spinning.</p>
<p>"Hey! That hillside over there is Qilibao! The only villa I was talking about is on the left of the fort," the old driver said to me, gazing ahead and turning his head halfway.</p>
<p>"Weren't you going to tell me about the fort? I've been holding back the punchline." "Well then, you can tell it now, okay?"</p>
<p>"What's so bad about that?..." So he coughed twice, whipped the horse twice, and the story began like this:</p>
<p>"Ahem! ...Rich people always have a lot of things to deal with. They're full, they've had enough to drink, they have nothing to do, and boring things follow!</p>
<p>The owner of that villa was in his fifties. I've even met him. He was very strong. He had never been an official. He lived a very comfortable life thanks to his ancestors' estate. He always went on a trip once a year, and that would take a month or two.</p>
<p>His wife was said to be very young, only in her twenties. Some people say she was his concubine, but I don't know! In short, their relationship wasn't very good, tch! There was always something going on! ...Hahaha...!</p>
<p>It was probably, ...uh, that's right, it was in the autumn seven years ago. The gentleman had just returned from Qingdao, where he had gone to escape the summer heat, and that's when the tragic events gradually unfolded.</p>
<p>The reason was that the gentleman had brought back from Qingdao...</p>
<p>...What? ...Haha, the nature of that relationship doesn't need me to explain! The old gentleman spent every day with that girl and had long thrown his wife to the four winds! ...Hmph! The wife didn't like the old man, but the old man treated that girl so well, which aroused her jealousy and resentment. Isn't that right? For about the first month, they argued several times every day. The old gentleman always protected that girl and found many reasons to make things difficult for his wife. Several times, the old gentleman even hit his wife.</p>
<p>The rift between them deepened day by day.</p>
<p>One night, suddenly the old gentleman's beloved girl died, her whole body turning blackish-purple and covered with spots, and blood flowed from her mouth, nostrils, and other places. The old gentleman was desperate. He knew who had caused her death. By the time he picked up his gun and rushed to his wife's room, she had already disappeared. His mind lost control, and he fired his gun aimlessly, killing two servants and a maid. So... he then went... somewhere. Sometimes he would laugh... sometimes he would wail... sometimes he would say things that no one else could understand, running through every house in Qilibao looking for something! ...Alas! ...</p>
<p>After making such a fuss for less than a month, the poor old gentleman also disappeared, but he was found less than a week later. He was found dead in a mud puddle less than two miles from Qilibao! ...".</p>
<p>"Hey! ...Look!" The old driver raised his voice and pointed to a small white house hidden behind a belt of pine trees. "...That's the villa! ...Do you see it, sir! ..."</p>
<p>My heart was being bitten by something. I nodded!</p>
<p>"It's said that it's haunted at night! ...No one dares to pass by there at night! ..." The old driver said with some bluster.</p>
<p>"Is the fort lively?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Um! ...It's still a second-class small town. There are shops and everything. We can have lunch there... Oh! ..." He stopped the horse and burst out laughing! I asked him why he stopped the car, and he said, smiling, "I almost made a mistake. If I had entered the fort with my bare ass, I would have been beaten to a pulp! ..."</p>
<p>So he put on his pants.</p>
<h3>Old Russian Street</h3>
<p>— Luo Peng</p>
<p>In the early morning, pushing open the window, a gust of cool wind came, making me shiver involuntarily. Only then did I realize that autumn had arrived in the human world. The sky was gloomy. The leaves of the several mulberry trees outside the window, which had been a dense, yellowish green just a few days ago, were curled up, and one by one they began to fall from their branches, drifting and rolling in the sky and on the ground, like windmills.</p>
<p>I leaned on the window sill, lit a cigarette, and gazed at the empty square outside the window, filled with fine stones and broken tiles: A few days ago, there were crooked huts here, but they were forcibly demolished yesterday. In the distance, there were also a few equally dilapidated huts, scattered next to several high-rise buildings. Thinking about their future fate, I felt a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>I don't know when, a fine drizzle started to fall outside the window, as fine as spiderwebs. Although it didn't have the grandeur of a downpour, its power was not small: In a moment, the square was covered in mud, and puddles formed in the low-lying areas. Some dogs were listlessly squatting by the wall, their heads lowered to the ground, motionless, their large, sorrowful eyes wide open, rain dripping slowly from their heads, as if they were weeping. In a corner of the square, there were even a few puppies mournfully whimpering, intermittently, like Buddhist monks and Taoist priests blowing summoning horns in the dead of night.</p>
<p>The streetlights were bright, the drizzle fell even denser, and my stomach felt a little hungry. I didn't know how I had gotten through this day. Suddenly, I remembered Old Russian Street; every day when I went to the restaurant, I had to pass by there. I wondered how those White Russians who had been exiled to a foreign land were doing. Some might be hiding under other people's eaves, or perhaps they had drunk their fill of cheap liquor, numbly collapsed in the soggy mud, or were wandering the streets like stray dogs.</p>
<p>Crossing the square outside the window, I reached Old Russian Street. In fact, it was a dark and narrow alley where groups of White Russian men and women gathered; the patrol officers didn't often come here. Therefore, the waiters and shop assistants in those shops called this alley Old Russian Street.</p>
<p>I didn't carry an umbrella or wear a raincoat, and hurriedly ran there. I stood at the entrance of Old Russian Street. Under the street light stood a White Russian woman, the dim light shining on her pale face. Her thin, elongated body was enveloped in a loose, tattered overcoat. I recognized her. This woman asked me for a cigarette every night.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>"Hello!" She walked closer to me again: "Cigarettes," she said, moving her index finger. I quickly gave her a cigarette. She lit the cigarette and went back to her original spot.</p>
<p>Every night, after I gave her a cigarette, I would walk away, my body trembling. I didn't dare look at her too much. Tonight, I mustered up the courage to stand there.</p>
<p>Look! She threw the cigarette butt on the ground, and then hurriedly ran towards me, stepping wildly in the mud, splashing mud on my face; I panicked, wishing I could turn around and run. But unexpectedly, the woman passed by me, picked up a puppy squatting by the wall at the entrance of the street, tucked it into her arms, and walked towards the other end of Old Russian Street.</p>
<p>After taking only a few steps, she turned her head and glanced at me, closing her eyes and smiling, a lascivious smile! I ignored her and continued to stand there. She probably felt disappointed and sat down next to a group of White Russian men and women in the corner of the wall near her. They took turns smoking cigarettes, all silent, unable to say a word, letting the rain soak their bodies.</p>
<p>My stomach rumbled loudly with hunger, and the rain flowed down from my head, the cool breeze brushing my face, making it a little unbearable. But I didn't know if I felt sadness or anger? Standing there, I couldn't speak for a long time.</p>
<h3>Old Foreigner</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>From the second-class carriage of the 10:30 train from Davao, the old foreigner Chen Jinsui, carrying a suitcase, hurriedly squeezed out onto the platform. He was as fat and plump as a boar, and he panted as he walked. After leaving the platform, he put down the suitcase in his hand, took out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his face, and waved his hand far away like he was hailing a carriage. The coachman cleverly raised the long whip in his hand and shouted, urging the horse to come over.</p>
<p>"74 Pasig Road," the old foreigner jumped in and shouted angrily.</p>
<p>The coachman nodded meekly, whistling softly. The whip swirled in the air and then silently fell on the thin back of the horse, and the carriage began to move slowly. He looked around with disgust and then sank back into his uneasy thoughts. Three days ago, in Davao, he received a letter from a friend in Manila, talking about his daughter studying in Manila, so he rushed over. Now he felt very depressed and kept muttering to himself:</p>
<p>"No wonder she kept saying she was busy preparing for her studies and didn't come back to Davao for three holidays." After thinking for a while, he continued, "Then how should I tell her? I should tell her everything I know, and then angrily question her: Do you think you can hide it from me? Do you have anything else to say about this disgraceful matter? Why did I send you to Manila to go to university? You know it was for the honor of the overseas Chinese community, the honor of the Chen family. Now you have humiliated the Chen family and the entire overseas Chinese community. Do you have anything to say? No? Good, come back to Davao with me..."</p>
<p>He smiled, feeling very satisfied with his arrangement. During the day and night journey, he had been thinking about these words. He believed in his success.</p>
<p>"What will she do then?" he thought. "Surely, she will run in front of me, her eyes filled with tears, sobbing softly: — I... I was young and didn't know what I was doing, Dad, please forgive me! ... And me? I will sigh, gasping for breath: — I will forgive you, forgive you, child..."</p>
<p>The carriage jolted quickly, turned down a street, and then continued smoothly. The sun was listlessly shining on the hot asphalt road. The sound of horseshoes hitting the road was crisp and clear, vibrating in the silent street, and then disappearing into the hot, stuffy sky!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp thought pierced into his mind! "What if she resists?" He was very surprised, as if a prisoner had suddenly discovered that he was about to be executed: "Then, I will exercise the rights given to me by the law. I will appeal to the Supreme Court and sue the young man who is studying at the university and chasing after her. I will use justice to convince her: Think about it, a noble Chinese woman marrying this barbaric, uncivilized native, wouldn't that humiliate the entire overseas Chinese community? Wouldn't that humiliate the glory of our Chen family? For the sake of our glory and for the sake of your future, give him up, abandon him. There are plenty of well-off and wealthy Chinese men... Wouldn't her heart be moved by this? Yes, she will change her mind..."</p>
<p>The carriage was traveling along a quiet street. The coachman kept looking at the conspicuous house numbers on both sides with his two black, golden eyes, constantly muttering, "Twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight..."</p>
<p>Finally, he pulled the reins tightly, and the horse raised its head in fright, stomping its front hooves. After a moment, it stopped, drooping its sweaty head in frustration. The coachman then turned back to him and smiled slightly, "Sir, number 74 has arrived!"</p>
<p>The old foreigner leaned out and looked around. In front of him stood a row of neat little Western-style houses, the number 74 sign in blue and white smiling conspicuously at him. He paid the fare, jumped out, and strode in. In the parlor, a man dressed as a servant greeted him. He told him the surname of the person he was looking for and was led upstairs.</p>
<p>In a room with a certain surname written on it, he gently reached out and knocked. A Eurasian woman came out and opened the door for him. Then, a clear sound of the piano floated towards him. He stepped inside, feeling slightly displeased. This was a fairly well-decorated room. The flowered wallpaper on the walls and the curtains hanging in front of the windows made him a little dizzy. A woman in a nightgown was sitting in front of a piano, playing a choral piece. Not far from her, a dark-skinned young gentleman was sitting on a sofa chair, with a plump child of about one year old sitting on his lap, babbling and waving two small hands.</p>
<p>The old foreigner was a little surprised. He stopped abruptly, thinking that he had entered the wrong room. However, he quickly dismissed this suspicion. The woman who was playing the piano had already stood up and was facing him, revealing a timid and uneasy expression, and said to him in a low voice in English: "Dad..."</p>
<p>The gentleman sitting on the sofa also stood up abruptly with the child in his arms. He was a little flustered, but still wore a restrained smile on his face.</p>
<p>Before she had time to introduce them, he understood everything. He felt neither resentment nor despair. What was in front of him was an irreversible fact. What else could he say? He could only quietly...</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>"You've both done well, don't worry, child, I came here specifically to see you..."</p>
<p>His tears welled up and fell.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Trivialities</h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>My beloved Xian Boqing lost his job. — That was because the rubber factory went bankrupt.</p>
<p>The witch and matchmaker Xu Erguniang prayed to the Western Marquis King Bodhisattva for him.</p>
<p>"The Western Marquis King is efficacious. Half of my life has been blessed by the King. Didn't Gao Lao Chen Dehui's eldest son and crippled Tan get a job about a week or so after they prayed... Xu Erguniang's... like this... to Xian..."</p>
<p>And the result was very interesting: The unemployed rubber shoe factory worker frowned even tighter; Xu Erguniang was happy as if she had won several rounds of "Five Hundred."</p>
<p>On a drizzly autumn night, my beloved finally went back to his hometown with his family, frowning...</p>
<p>About three weeks after they left, the owner of the room that the worker lived in changed to a young couple. But, according to them, they had not yet been married.</p>
<p>The man was an elementary school teacher, with a small harmonium. In the quiet dusk, the harmonium's sob often accompanied an aged and melancholy low voice —</p>
<p>"Do you know how long life is!</p>
<p>You are still young,</p>
<p>Why hang your face like an old weeping willow!</p>
<p>Let me see: your</p>
<p>Eyes are not full of the vitality of life!</p>
<p>Just like that, live on." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On the Performance of the Chinese Translation of "The Fatherland"</h3>
<p>Today, Mr. Tang Huaiqiu leads the China Traveling Theatre Troupe in the premiere of the five-act historical drama "The Fatherland" (Patrie), originally written by Victorien Sardou, at the Carlton Theater. The play was successfully previewed last Monday, as noted in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Although we ourselves cannot fully appreciate the beauty and goodness of Mr. Chen Mian's translation, everything leads us to believe that his translation is very good, because Mr. Chen Mian is not only a national doctorate in our country (this degree is already a valuable guarantee, worthy of our respect), but also a literary scholar and practitioner. He has translated "Le Cid," and scholars who are fluent in both Chinese and French have praised it. If he can overcome the difficulty of translating such poetic and literary works, then translating this prose "The Fatherland" will be much easier for him.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Mian's hard work is not only satisfied with providing the translation of French dramas to their literary scholars, but also strives to realize these dramas on the Chinese stage. He cleverly writes to hope that the characters in the play will move on stage in front of the public, whether with joy or sorrow.</p>
<p>He found a proud collaborator in Mr. Tang Huaiqiu. The two complement each other, Mr. Chen Mian chose the play and translated it, and Mr. Tang Huaiqiu performed it.</p>
<p>Choosing a script is a difficult and delicate task. A tragedy or comedy cannot be welcomed by Chinese audiences simply because it is a masterpiece in its own country. There is a gap between Chinese drama and French or European drama.</p>
<p>When Mr. Chen Mian translated "Andromaque," he knew that he could not hope for the performance of this translation. The distance between Chinese flesh and ancient European history is too far, so it is difficult to be interested in plays with this theme, although Racine has renewed the ancient text. Furthermore, in this play, Racine's subtle descriptions of psychology require a lot of effort to be truly appreciated by Far Easterners, and this effort can only be done by people of special classes. (To be continued)</p>
