<p>時評</p>
<h3>法參謀總長訪波的意義</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>一九三四年一月德波互不侵犯條約締成後波蘭在對外政策上就同德國沆瀣一氣成了侵略陣綫中的外圍勢力而其同先前同盟者法國的關係則漸漸疏遠起來尤其對於法國與蘇聯訂立互助公約最表不滿因為波蘭的政權一向握在右翼的軍人手中而這些軍人却是極端痛恨社會主義的蘇聯的</p>
<p>但是正當德波二國打得火熟的時候法國的陸軍參謀總長甘茂林却於本月十二日往訪華沙勾留四日之久受波蘭軍政要人的熱烈歡迎這在法波未來關係的演變上實是最可注意的事情法國陸軍最高領袖的訪問華沙從一九二三年法國故福煦上將往訪波蘭以後這還是第一遭甘茂林在波京曾同波蘭的最高權力者陸軍總監資米格里『推心致腹從長討論二國互有關係之各項問題』又同國務總理斯克拉哥斯某將軍軍政部長喀斯浦爾齊基外長柏克上校等舉行談話莫錫基總統並贈甘茂林以波蘭復國大綬勳章反政府的人十也發表意見以為波政府應乘這個機會决定親德或親法的政策從這些情形觀察就可知甘茂林這次訪問波京的重要意義了</p>
<p>波蘭的外交政策是否將因甘茂林這次的訪問而有所變動呢換句話說波蘭是否將放棄親德的政策而重溫法波同盟的舊夢呢就我們現在所得的資料說對於這個問題實還不能作確切的論斷不過法波同盟條約現仍繼續存在而執掌波蘭政權的資米里格一批軍人之採取親法政策也是我們所熟知的在過去波蘭之所以同德國沆瀣一氣主要的原因是由於希特勒暫時對波放棄收回失地（如波蘭走廊與但澤自由市）的主張及國社黨的反蘇聯政策之適合波蘭右翼軍人的口味同時德蘇的反臉與「賴蒲羅」（Rappolo）精神的消滅也正是華沙政府所求之不得的其次的原因是由於法國對德政策的軟弱使波蘭威覺法國恐不能帮助它防止敵人的進攻不過這種親德的外交政策波蘭的當局與人民不論派別的左右也都感到含有很大的危險性因為他們深知德國是絕不會永久放棄其已失的土地的同時已故畢爾蘇斯基將軍領導下的軍人對於法國向來抱有好威而波蘭的被壓迫大衆對於蘇聯也絕沒有什麽不好的印象所以波蘭的當局與人民如果一旦都發覺國社黨並不够做一個永久的「友邦」時那末他現在的外交政策也許就會立刻改變了</p>
<p>沙羅維基克（G.Soloveytchik）在八月號雙週評論中寫了一篇「波蘭的難題」文末論外交政策的前途時大意說「在未來大戰中波與德聯盟如果戰而敗波蘭當然倒霉但是卽使戰而勝波蘭也毫無好處因為德國必將乘機收復失地擴充第三帝國的版圖」要是波蘭當局與人民都能够深切體味這幾句話中所含的至理那未此後波蘭外交的何去何從也就很容易决定了。</p>

<p>粵新任黨政軍長官、十七日晨舉行宣誓就職典禮、蔣委員長代表　中央親臨監誓、並致訓詞、原詞如下、各位同志、今天我們廣東黨務政治　軍事各委員同志、在中山紀念堂聯合宣誓就職、中正奉中央之命、親至監誓、得以參加這個盛大的典禮、和許多闊別十年的　各位同志見面、想到十年以前的種種正像遊子重歸家庭、有說不出的感慨、各位都知道今天這一個盛會、是革命策源地、重新回復到本黨眞正領導的一個紀念、是余總司令　率領陸空海軍各位將士和各位同志、從千辛萬苦中　撥亂反正奮鬥出來的結果、也就是我們以後努力　開創統一中國的起點、實在是非常難得的一個盛會、中正趁這個機會、要將自己的感想、和我們黨政軍各方面以後的希望、以及怎麽努力途徑、向大家說一說、首先我可以說　廣東不僅是中國的廣東、實在是中國國民黨的廣東、廣束與中國國民革命、有不可分的關係、我們總理畢生革命四十年、始終以廣東為惟一根據地、在民國成立以前、和滿淸政府奮鬥、民元以後、和叛逆和割據軍閥苦鬥、其間不知經過多少艱難危險和痛苦、不幸在十三年本黨　改組以後、到民國十四年、總理就棄我們而長逝了、在總理臨逝世以前的幾年間、廣東的現狀是割據　分裂到不成樣子、無數的軍閥、把持了財政和省政、各省軍隊拿廣東　當一個恣意割據的地盤、簡直弄到民不聊生、廣東的民衆、簡直辨不出　這是革命呢還是軍閥呢、這些叛逆和軍閥、完全不聽總理的命令、只向總理要餉要械、多方要挾、甚至無理取鬧、圖謀不軌、總理始終以寬大為懷、苦心的維持這個革命根據地、但是內心的痛苦日深、不久便去世了、中正常時認定「廣東的局面不統一、革命便將無法進展、如果廣東統一了、中國的統一便不成問題、」自從十四年奉本黨之命、便與一般同志尤其率領武裝同志、用兩年的苦工、始將盤據廣東的叛逆與軍閥肅淸、把四分五裂的廣東統一起來、以廣東的利益還給廣東民衆、以整個革命　策源地交給了本黨的中央、而後革命有了基礎、纔一意進行北伐、自從離開廣東、忽忽不覺十年、因為中正常時忽忽出師北伐、沒有把軍事和黨務根木整理好、沒有把革命基礎奠立穩固、也沒有將革命的　光明大道和基本精神、完全灌輸給後繼者、亦沒有將實行主義的方法、傳授於留守同志、使他能够照着革命精神做到底、以至十年之間、紛亂迭起、全國的革命進展雖益遠、而革命策源地的痛苦亦於是加深、黨務糾紛、政治苛虐、不但民衆痛苦、黨員痛苦、尤其使得許多　僑胞受盡了種種痛苦、在這十年中間、我們眞正革命黨員、連來到廣東都不可能，革命成績幾乎是全隳了、整個的革命基礎、幾乎是傾覆了、這固然由於後繼者的不知自處、連續走向錯誤的道路、但中正反躬自問、總由自己道義與信用不够、實在是塊對總理、塊對　袍澤、尤其對不起贊助革命犧牲　最大的廣東的民衆、現在幸得余總司令及各位將士、深明大義、撥亂反正、共同一致的把　革命策源地恢復了過來、把廣東在歷史上的光榮地位、恢復過來、回想過去十年的苦痛、到今天我們革命的　將士和同志、得能大家團聚一堂、將眞革命者、假革命者分淸楚了、自己撫今思昔、眞是悲痛慚愧、不可以言語形容、各位同志、要知道這一次撥亂　反正的事業、是不容易的、是余總司令及陸海　空軍各位將士、尤其是空軍同志、在極惡劣的環境之中、重持革命的信心、認識國家民族的立塲、擁護正義、分別公私、千辛萬苦中奮鬥出來、這種大仁大勇、至公至忠的精神、把十年來的障翳、一筆掃淸、大家須知道　這是十分艱難的事、唯有袛知有國、不知有己、袛知有革命，不知有　權利的人、纔能做得到、尤其是余總司令以决各位將士、都能公忠體國、犧牲地位、實在可做革命軍人的表率、這一次我們能够將廣東　這一個革命根據地、恢複過來、統一於中央命令之下、固然由于很多同志　與將領的决心奮鬥、而余總司令對黨國忠誠的精神、尤其是値得我們戚慰、卽如這一次他在南京　沒有回廣東之先、中正曾經開誠的問他、「中央完全知道你是革命的、為使你能澈底負起整理廣東的責任、要將軍事政治完全交給你、使你能放手負責辦事、希望你把軍民兩政、整個的擔任起來、遵照中央的命令和紀律去做、造成一個模範省區、」余總司令當時就說、」軍事我可以全力擔負、和各位同胞共同努力、政治的事情、實在才力不勝、必須由中央另簡賢能、擔任省府的職務、」他這種虛心克已、光明正大的精神、實在不愧為現代革命軍人的模範、於此更可以知道　我門廣東官兵、這一次反正、完全是出於革命的立塲、余總司令他是澈底的要求統一、希望中央能將　廣東這一個重要革命根據地、根本改造起來、鞏固起來、以完成復興民族的大業、有他這種精神、更加之以廣東所有的革命將士、能够自動拋棄軍長　師長旅長的地位、開民國以來革命軍人以前未有的新紀元、這種偉大而値得　紀念的事蹟、實在為國家增加了無限的希望和力量、我更希望輔助　余總司令的文武同志、大家都體念他這個光明磊落、犬公無我的懷抱、助成其美德、貫澈其事業、吾人如眞正革命、總要以主義成敗與民族禍福為前提、而不可以個人利害與得失為中心、不要只顧目前的利害、而要為國家立定　千秋萬世不拔之基礎、務使狹隘自私、或是分別門戶畛域的舊時落伍觀念、完全絕跡於統一後的新廣東、我們黨政軍各方面的同志、要知道這時候全國　同胞是怎樣的注意廣東　今後的設施與發展、廣東同胞又是怎樣期待　我們的實行主義與新政治的出現、我們在這個千載一時的機會、要安慰全國同胞、和廣東同胞的期望、最緊要的、必須黨政軍完全一致、同心協力的來努力、不好再像從前一樣、現在必須黨部政府與軍隊各盡權責、共同推動、為社會民衆造福、纔不愧為革命的策源人、軍隊黨部與政府、皆須如此、三者之間、要有整個密切的聯繫、向一個目標進行、而且必須與社會實際利害　和民衆發生密切關係、大家必須在這個時候、合力打定一個很堅實完好的基礎、造成了實現三民主義的　模範省區、安慰痛苦的民衆、刷新廣東的政治、挽回過去的頺風、完成偉大的事業、（未完）</p>

<h3>日本人在北平</h3>
<p>（北平特信）</p>
<p>日本在華北之僑民、現已達一萬九千餘人、（連朝鮮人在內）其中居於北平者、大槪必在三數千左右、再加上使館人員及其眷屬、駐屯軍隊·娼妓·以及來去無根可查　之浪人等類、大槪經常在北平之日本人、必達五六千左右、此輩日本人、因面色興吾國人無異、而有時着西服或羞中國長衫之故、往往難與吾國人區別、不過在通常情形下、其兩腿似較吾國人稍短、至於少數例外者、則不待其開口絕不知其為日本人、然亦有操吾國國語極流利者、所有在北平之日本人中、最引人注意者、厥為駐屯軍、此輩駐軍、常常三五成羣、甚或整隊而出、全付武裝、在市塲及王府井大街一帶、來往梭巡、一律紅箍帽、黃制服、面紅潤、而肩背寬闊、興吾國軍隊之灰制服、瘦弱不堪者、完全不同、但若以之與歐美各國使館　之駐軍相較、則不獨身段雄偉不如、卽其制服亦覺縐紋累累、挺直不及、日軍於遊行、沿路高聲喧嚷、旁若無人、去歲寒假、在東安市塲、曾公然於稠人廣衆中、調戲婦女、一時惹起吾國人士甚大之反感、上月坦克車在平市遊行示威時、又毆擊美國新聞記者、並毀其攝影機、其後道歉賠償了事、其驕橫可見一斑、</p>
<p>其次最引人側目者、為浪人之屬、此輩日韓浪人、除經營種種不法事業外、雖時常結黨成羣、赴公園·電影院·市塲等公共塲所、來往閒蹓、口中非笑則唱、衣冠亦極不整齊、有上衣為極講究之西服、而下穿短小骯髒之麻布褲者、亦有上穿中國長衫、下穿木展、騎脚踏車在街頭兜圈子者、奇形怪狀、不一而足、有時則在娼寮裏興風作浪、鬧得滿城風雨、大都亦此輩浪人、記者曾目擊有浪人四五口、在公園裏、圍擊一中國小孩之頭頂、該孩痛哭不已、而浪人等則反呵呵大笑、擊不稍休、資以為樂、</p>
<p>浪人經營之不法事業、的有下列幾種，（一）販運白銀、（二）販運銅元、（三）販運走私貨物、（四）開白面房子、（五）開賭窟、（六）開跳舞塲、在去年吾國未施行幣制改革以前、此輩浪人、曾公然用皮箱柳包之類、成捆成堆、强運白銀出關、吾國憲警、視之亦無可如何、彼時北平市面、銀元一元、可換紙幣一元二角、金融之不安可知、自吾國幣制改革、白銀國有以後、此輩浪人、乃改業運販銅元、一時市面銅元、大感缺乏、銅元票之票面價額、與實際之銅元兌換價格、出入甚大、因而日用物品價格、漲落無定、中小市民、大受影響、今年走私貨物賺錢較多、此輩浪人、乃又轉而經營走私貨物、平津道上、以及平通道上、僕僕來往、以致北平私貨山積、皆此輩浪人為之、在公安街束交民巷西口之瑞金大樓內、並設有辦事處、門外有斗大之字六個、日「國際運輸公司」、現在走私貨物又成强弩之末、無利可獲矣、彼輩不知將又出何種新花樣也、除上述三種外、尚有三種為彼輩經常經營之事業、第一為白面房子、此地自烈性毒品治罪暫行條例頒佈以來、卽嚴刑峻法、以懲販毒·製毒·及吸毒者、至巨前為止、中國人開設之白面房子、可說已全告肅淸、如非日韓浪人公然販賣、則雖欲吸毒、亦將無從購買、毒氛自可稍殺、無奈彼輩公然開設白面房子、中國軍警、除少數可予查抄外、大半無可如何、此外卽係開設賭窟、賭窟之中、烟·賭·娼妓、伴件俱全、如前門外煤市街之北京大旅社、卽其最著者、自今年春天以來、彼輩又發現一可以大賺其錢之事、斯卽開設跳舞塲是也、除公安街之金扇舞蹈塲外、六月間、又於東長安街以資本十萬元之鉅、開一白宮跳舞塲、其中日韓俄以及中國之舞女俱全、共的數十名、經理為韓國醫生金桐谷博士、此舞塲在此地為規模最大者、最近又有浪人從事綁票者矣、如朱紹陽夫人之被綁、幸而破案迅速、使之膽寒、不然、隱患興不堪設想、</p>
<p>浪人之中、尤以朝鮮人最凶蠻無理、但彼輩一遇日本人則又俯首貼耳、殊為馴服、韓國人在此掛牌行醫者頗多、但大多門可羅雀、故所謂行醫、亦不過幌子而已、其另外均別有副業、此輩韓人、因其不講理之故、在市上租房頗難、房東畏之如虎、避之唯恐不及、於是彼輩乃異想天開、與中國漢奸之流勾結、使之打聽何處有空閒待租之房屋時、則卽强佔居住、不付房錢、故近數月以來、房租糾紛之事、無時無之、現當局對與之勾結佔房之中國人、已决用極刑懲處、</p>
<p>日韓娼妓、大都集中東城范子平板船巷等地、其中涉足者、多係西洋軍警水手之類、中國人不常光顧、此輩娼妓、除有時塗脂抹粉招搖過市外、並不像日韓浪人之趾高氣揚、到處亂闖、蓋亦日人中之可憐虫也、</p>
<p>前中日關係緊張時、浪人之屬、曾大肆紛擾、一比較有名之中國人住宅中、常有此輩光臨訪問、或以對中日關係之觀戚見問、或以最近之出處相詢、令人不堪其擾、各圖書館中、彼輩亦常常出入、身帶××特務機關、或××軍部徽章、亦不辨其眞僞、有時欲携走雜誌報章、有時又欲收買善本圖書、種種無理取鬧、不一而足、</p>
<p>除日使館人員外、其他文化工作人員、以及有敎養之日本人士、與軍人浪人等類、究竟大不相同、此等日人、除外表略露驕熊外、其餘尚無令人難與相處之處、卽以開設日文補習學校之日人、以及在各大學旁聽之日本學生而論、大率都能保持相當禮貌、較之種色不同習慣不同之歐美人士、反覺易於相處、北京大學之日本旁聽生某君、去歲曾因某教授於國際公法課堂上、大斥日本違反國際公法事、而提出責問、但經某敎授略加解釋後、該生亦卽折服、不再爭持、此到底較軍人浪人之蠻不講理、高出多多矣、</p>

<p>兩浙鹽務稅警局長張中立氏昨日因公來滬、中央社記者、昨特往訪詢問暴動之原故及其事實之經過、　張氏答稱如下、</p>
<p>鹽斤歸堆　有利無害</p>
<p>鹽盡歸　、乃實行新鹽法之初步、亦正所以便利漁民與鹽民、兩浙區內如南鹽長林淸泉定海等塲、早已先後舉辦、岱山鹽民製鹽、向皆自行入岙兜銷、無倉堆儲、故管理不便、就塲征稅之辦法、無從實施、在鹽民方面、遇鹽產滯銷時、每有價格慘跌之苦、若產量不濟、漁民有魚無鹽、亦復受高抬鹽價之弊、歸堆之制、係分漁鹽食鹽兩種設施、漁鹽堆之建築、必擇漁船集中之區、修築碼頭、使納稅配鹽、隨做隨放、時間經濟、手續敏捷、若遇產量短絀、公家即預為計畫、設法借配、就塲征稅並可免查騐手續、及其他一切麻煩、至於食鹽歸堆後、鹽斤由公家負責、代為保管、免去失漏之虞、興築塲內道路、以利運輸、劃一鹽價、不得競銷、遇滯銷時由公家借欵調劑、其鹽斤如何收放、時間如何規定、均統籌適當辦法、所謂鹽務辦公時間以外、鹽民不能送鹽歸堆、漁民不能到堆購鹽、皆屬挑撥之詞、實際並非如此、故鹽斤歸堆、實為達到科學管理之惟一辦法、亦卽實行新鹽法之初步、為鹽民漁民之正當業務計、有利無害、除不便於其買私賣私外、絕無反對之理由、</p>
<p>漁鹽變色　防止充銷</p>
<p>漁鹽變色、　在防止充銷食鹽、部令久經頒布、各區一體實行、非自岱山始、岱山為兩浙第二大塲、亦全國首要漁區、當然不能例外、况所變色寳、迭經財寶兩部愼重考慮、選派專家試騐後、乃謀實行、决無發霉與易腐之弊、其所以多方反對者、無非因一經變色、不易充銷、換個之、卽不能以三角稅之漁變、充銷七元一角稅之食鹽而巴、查岱山一地、可為統計者、每年漁鹽充銷蘇五屬七元一角之食鹽、約四十萬担、損害國稅的三百萬元、國家獎勵漁業、特設輕稅、乃反為蝕課營私之資、公家以漁鹽變色、為防制計、實出事理之平、且溫台兩屬、自去年卽已實行、並無窒碍、本年推行於定岱兩區、其無損於漁民正當之利益、可斷言也、</p>
<p>漁鹽羣衆　暴動經過</p>
<p>此次岱山漁鹽民之暴動、在七月十三日事前有主動組織之人、蓋平素利用漁鹽民為生計者、先於七月十日、在資福寺鹽業信用合作社、召集開會、以激烈言動反對歸堆、七月十一日、相率罷晒、七月十二日、有鹽民黃葆仁、因仍晒鹽、致鹽板被毀、並將勸解理說之李仁富拖往東嶽宮吊打、經耶長黃恭　報由公安局援救出險、至七月十三日、復在東獄宮、召集漁首、引合鹽民、據大開會、人數旣衆、遂生暴行、先將工程處之測量夫劉鳳生捉去、懸樑毒打、其妻得悉、奔至秤放局求救、經派胡隊長　警數名、會同公安局官警、前往營救、途中卽遇羣衆、將測量夫捆綁而來、胡隊長恐起誤會、命警停進、只帶警士長徐勵一名、上前勸解、乃羣衆蜂擁而進、搶奪徐勵所佩之木壳槍、正爭持間、復有暴徒連續開槍、將徐勵擊倒、暴行遂由此擴大、是役暴衆數千人、鹽務人員被害者九、重傷者三、且多被剖腹挖心、沉之海中、殘酷之狀、駭人聽聞、且在暴衆包圍局隊時、發槍甚密、迄今斷牆殘壁間、彈痕累累、為之諒者、猶謂其手無武器、至當時胡隊長愼重應付、嚴禁警士實彈平射、故在其大暴動中、漁鹽民死者僅有一人、</p>
<p>處理善後　力持寬和</p>

<p>（三）影片之營業方法</p>
<p>（二）該華公司—該公司係大中華，百合，民新，上海，等公司合併而成，初時資本四十萬元，由何東爵士羅文幹等為董事，羅明佑為總經理，十九年十月正式成立。過去向採分廠制，前後共設七廠。第一·二·四·六·四廠　於上海，第三廠設於香港，第五廠設於北平，第七廠設於四川。其後　廠因淞滬之戰被毀，五廠以『九一八』停辦，七廠以川亂停辦。於是一面增加資本為一百萬元，一面變更廠制以準際為單位，上海之一·二·六·三廠改為一，二，三，三廠，香港之第三廠改為香港製片廠，原為四廠之上海公司，脫離聯華，獨立改組為上海有聲影片公司，及羅氏遊美歸來，該公司復改為集廠制，於二十四年一月一日頒布集中計劃，四月一日上海之廠均集中徐家滙，原第一廠址，擴充基地，整頓內部。該公司出品，取材上乘，能迎合一般靑年心理，但以流動資金不足，故出品緩慢，現有職演員二百餘人，每月開支需一萬五千元左右，茲將該公司歷年出品數量列表於后：</p>
<p>該公司以前所攝，除『野草閒花』，『銀漢雙星』，　　盤配音外，其他均伊默玲，現已購置有聲機，已攝成聲片「浪淘沙」「慈母曲」等兩部。</p>
<p>（三）天一公司—係邵醉翁兄弟所共司經營，初為合夥，現改公司組織，成立於民上　年，在南洋設有分公司，經理本公司及其他公司出品，公司地址設甘世東路，二三二號，其出品頗為迅速，二十年購置慕維通有聲機，攝製有聲片，除自行製片外，並代小公司拍攝，如古代公司之「四郎探母」，南方公司之「白金龍」等皆是，過去數年無聲片出品達八十餘部，聲片達三十餘部，為滬上各公司出品最多者，該公司在香港向設有分廠，去年起以滬上不易立足，乃注全力發展港廠，攝製迎合南洋僑胞心理之粵語聲片，滬總廠範圍已較前縮小，最近新時代公司停辦，演「王先生」之全　演員，復入天一，聞現正從事攝製「王先生」續集云，該公司現有職工共一百餘人，每月開支的一萬元左右。（未完）</p>

<h3>訪問家庭主婦</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>家庭以主婦為主體，國貨之大主顧為家庭，而購用之權，實操於主婦。主婦而愛用國貨，國貨之推行，如火始然，如水就下，極為順利也。故推廣國貨，提倡國貨，當自家庭始。允非從主婦方面下手不可。</p>
<p>吾人嘗就中等以上之家庭，訪問其主婦，探詢其對於服用國貨之意見，大都樂於購用國貨，以為中國人應用中國貨，是天經地義無容遲疑之事。惟服用以後，輒覺國貨尚有如下之缺點，希望設法改進：（一）出品欠標準化，往往同一物品，上次形式如此，下次已見走樣，乃至色澤，質地，效用，時有出入。（二）裝璜尚欠講究，包紮裝箱等，均乏研究工夫。（三）價値未能力求低廉，大率在成本一時不易减輕之故。（四）往往用戶需用某種貨品時，不能供應，隨便以他種或副牌品搪塞，（五）專喜摩倣他人，未能保存中國固有之美質。此對於工廠方面而言。尚有對於國貨商店或公司等之意見：（一）店員缺乏服務精神，購貨時往往拖延時問，不勝厭煩。（二）對於國貨未能置備齊全，價格亦至不一律。（三）未能詳細指導顧客，說出某種貨品之性質效用，與外貨作比較之說明。此為服用國貨上未盡滿意之點，而由一百餘主婦口中所說出，大可供製造者與販賣者之參考。今上海市國貨運動聯合會，有派員訪問各家庭主婦勸導服用國貨之舉，此種極有意義極有價値之工作，確為推進國貨之根本方策。深願其早日實現，因述所見，以促其成。</p>
<h3>國貨捲菸紙小言</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>現在辦國貨事業，最抱憾的，是工廠出品固然純粹國貨，而業璜物料　非國貨的，或惠有原料成分中，含着舶來品的，這：在於主持國貨工廠的當局，應切實負起責任來，深思焦慮的換用國貨，毅力改革的，萬一無國貨可代，則當研究貢獻國人仿製，今嘉興民豐造紙廠，能利用這一點，製造國貨捲菸紙，招待滬新聞界參觀，該捲菸紙並已由南洋兄弟烟草公司，首先採用，不可謂非我國國貨事業的逐漸在進步—好消息傳來，同深雀躍！蓋捲烟在我國的消耗量，着實可驚！例以每人日吸十枝論，上海一埠，姑以吸者百萬人計，卽需千萬枝，平均每枝以國幣一分計，需耗費十萬元一天！合全國統計起來，豈不可驚？而菸「紙」所占之百分比，化之於灰燼的金錢，當亦不在少數，漏巵之鉅，寗不痛心！故民豐廠之國貨捲菸紙，殊為可貴！深廳各國貨捲烟公司，一致採用之，因國貨捲菸紙，聯想到大漏巵的新聞捲筒紙，希望最近的將來，也給我一個「有國產品」的喜訊！</p>
<h3>非常時期的國貨運動</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>國人自覺悟到外貨的充斥市場，足使中國經濟命脈為之斷絕，而開始作提倡國貨運動以來，倏忽已有幾個年頭之久。然而我們如果把往事檢討一下，細審幾年來國貨運動的成績如何，那麽說來會使你覺得失望呢，不信，我們袛要看到近年來入超的數宇，依然不見低落，便可反正提倡國貨，所得的效果原是微乎其微呢！事實上在此非常時期，國人對於提倡國貨運動，可再不能敷衍了事，有名無實而加重國家的危難了。所以每一個國民，特別是在非常時期應得都明白到提倡國貨的重要，而加緊國貨運動的工作。</p>
<p>提倡國貨的有效辦法，决不是空口說白話所能奏效的，目前最重要的一點，就在各人能够以身作則。各地的當局，首先實行服用國貨，才能使下面的公務員也服用國貨；學校敎師首先服用國貨，才能使學生不用洋貨：一家之主，他自己能够服用國貨，子弟們才會厭用洋貨。口頭在說提倡國貨，家裏吃的，用的，還是洋貨居多；小學敎師向學生講述提倡國貨運動的重要，但他自己身上穿着一身西裝；這樣的提倡國貨，可以說效果等於零，所以提倡國貨須得必以身作則呢！</p>
<p>同時，工廠方面，在此非常時期，對於國貨出品，也再不能組製濫造了，因為貨品的低劣，在市塲上面，决不會能和洋貨對敵的。我們有了良好的國貨用品，才能使國人採用國貨而把洋貨慢慢的擠出各地市場；因此，每一個工廠，應得對於自己的出品，要特別注意，悉心研究，精　求精，使貨品的質地精良之後，才能敵得過洋貨。所以國貨工廠再不能忽略自己的資任，而應得把出品的質地提高，製法改進，才能應付這個非常時期。</p>
<p>就是工人，在這個非常時期，除了應當使他所製的物品，改進之外，還要盡各人的力量，使生產率增加，因為生產率的加多，可使國貨物品成本因以低减，成本一低，在市的上和洋貨競爭起來，自然比較可以獲得使利。所以在此非常時期，每一個工人，應當明白他所負使命的重大，各盡其力，以謀出品的進步和加多，為社會國家而努力生產，當然是工人應付此非常時期時莫大的大職。</p>
<p>目前華北走私問題，是這樣的嚴重，這個問題，直接間接，當然都可使國貨工業致於死命，而加緊我們非常時期的經濟危機。其實我們袛要仔細一想，所謂走私問題，事實上也未始沒有對付的方法。那麼用什麽方法來對付呢？袛要大家一心一德，不用洋貨，走私的貨物，為了愉稅，售價可以便宜，但我們無論他怎樣便宜，不去買他們，那麽就有洋貨走私，於我也無所損。所以决心不用洋貨，是對付走私問題的一個有效辦法，所在國人能實行拒用洋貨耳。</p>
<h3>行將湮沒的江陰土布</h3>
<p>— 金人同</p>
<p>在高呼抵制外貨提倡國貨的時候。有一種眞正國貨行將沒落這是一件多麽値得注意的事</p>
<p>曉得江陰這地方的，都認為是國防重鎭。不知江陰還有個土布的特產是一種農家副業，江陰土布，是用純粹國貨紗線織成的。大別有杜布與廠布兩種：杜布較厚，適於冷天做襯衫褲。廠布較薄，可做春夏的裏衣，也可做外袍長衫。都有着經久耐用的優點，以前閉關自守的時候，牠除能解决江陰全縣人的衣的問題外；還能行銷各地，來輔助經濟上的流通。自被洋貨衝入市塲，因用戶的喜美觀念的滋長。與廠家的舉守舊法，不事改進。不特外埠的銷路銳减，土布在本縣地位亦漸動搖。更因廠家受外貨原料，價廉的誘惑。使市上流行的土布，也將只存其名了。</p>
<p>抵制外貨，是救濟本國工商業的原則。而提倡國貨，却又是抵制外貨的先决條件。國貨應當提倡，豈能再任其湮沒。那麼這純粹國貨，以致名不副實的江陰土布，我希望有幾個專家來研究改進牠。更希望一般愛國同胞，來提倡服用牠。因為牠還有經久耐用的優點哪。</p>
<h3>國貨界的難關</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>目前國貨界戚到最嚴重的一個問題，莫過於華北走私問題的惹人注意了。據大美晚報記者的調查，自從華北走私問題發生以後，工商界已受到嚴重的影響的，約有下列數項：</p>
<p>一·昔日上海一埠，本為絲襪輸入之總樞，但今日情形大變，一般來往滬港等地之輪船僕役，紛紛私帶大批絲襪，來滬銷售，獲利之厚，超過其薪金之收入，蓋因上海絲襪之進口稅，須百分之百，此輩船役，至滬下船之時，將絲襪藏於衣服之內，登陸時無人能發覺也。</p>
<p>二·某紙商談：目下在華北方面，已毫無交易，本埠市塲之所以尚未受到影響者，實因大批紙張，過於笨重，私運不易，但亦不過時間上之問題，早晚總有受影響之一日</p>
<p>三·某雜貨商經理稱：敝處營業，所受之影響，的有兩種：第一卽為天津分行，以前天津各雜貨商店，卽由滬採辦貨物，自私運開始以後，所有營業，已完全無有。第二，卽為敝處所經售的某數種貨物，實際上皆有私貨運至各地，營業前途，殊屬不堪設想。</p>
<p>四·……</p>
<p>根據上述，我們可知自從走私問題發生後，我工商界已受到嚴重的影響。在此提倡國貨運動稍具成效之際。不幸而發生此華北走私問題，這不但是華北工商樂界所應急切注意的一個問題，以整個的國貨運動而論，實在也是一個不容忽視的重大難關。</p>
<p>中華工業總聯合會在它呈實業部請求制止華北走私的呈文中說：「華北走私，舉國工商，莫不惶駭！危害我國生產事業，至深且鉅，際茲百業凋敝，欲圖維持，尚屬匪易，更何堪受此重大打擊？……不特國貨市塲，被其擯奪無遺，抑且影饗我國之關稅收入，為害伊於胡底？…」這幾句話，正是我們欲說而未說的。政府為保護方在萌芽的國貨事業起見，對于這個重大的華北走私問題，實非用迅雷不及掩耳的制止之法不為功，要知道這是國貨界的一個難關，實業界與政府當局，如不通力合作，以謀華北走私的問題的總解决，國貨前途，實在是不能樂觀的。</p>

<h3>證劵　掉期取捨不同　公債漲跌　巿况已在醖釀待變之中</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市况趨於盤旋、有醞釀待變之狀、各帮多數尚在觀望、賣出者仍為四號十號及十六號等居多、趨勢忽高忽低、前途恐有轉變、昨日交易、多數為掉期、市價波動甚微、頭盤初堅後疲、略小五分一角至三角、次盤卽見混沌、因掉期取捨之不同、市價仍升沉於五分至一二角之間、午後開盤、六號稍有吸收、趨勢略形轉堅、一致趨高一角至三角半、收盤前列仍堅、續好一角左右、甲乙兩　反小去一二角、形勢已覺不振、甲種市價過高、適在抽籤舉行之後、檯面頗有現貨流出、且以甲種向極堅强、故做多者咸彙集於此、故難免尚欲軋多、市價結果、繼續好起五分一角至三角、惟丁種近期為七十二號現貨流出壓小五分、甲種為浮多出脫小二角、成交總數、共計六百五十八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　粉價易漲難跌　海外報漲關係…昨父提三四分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈逐步暴升之　、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、均回漲五六角左右、故開價後、各月份市面、一致活躍、較之前日收價均提漲二三四分不等、一時買氣激昂、似出意料之外、因洋麥報價、漲跌不常、實不能過分利用、但業內外心思、鑒於國際間之物價不平衡、未免側重、所以不顧銷塲如何、不顧有關民食、依然以做多為鵠的、市面之易漲難跌、莫非此故也、以後各盤、本月份因補空較暢、仍然穩挺、餘則已轉盤旋、觀察後步、如無調劑方法、市氣尚難平服云、</p>
<h3>到存俱稀　期麥又創新高價　現麥已開至五元一</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份市面、均呈騰貴之態、因洋麥報價、回漲九六角不等、而市塲人心、則以小麥到存較稀、內地行市、復較申地為高、有此情形、人心遂逐步穩固、至各月份之漲度、雖不巨大、但以市値已達高峰、如八月份已衝至五元零七分、此種行情、又為三四年來之創見、遠期各月份，亦因人心良好、開價卽提好三五分、以後則交易茲暢、價趨盤旋、現麥市面、因廠　尚佳、客戶扳價、特高貨又提五分、如臨淮關五河麥已開至五元一角之大關、次為零五分、洋河沙河集張八嶺麥五元零一分、烏衣麥五元、淮安麥五元零五分、次五元、蚌埠麥五元零四分、次零一分、又次四元九角半、漢口麥四元九角六分、次八角八分、次八角三分、由阜覽去五千包、　新去四千包、申大去一千包云、</p>
<h3>新糙湧到立小二三角</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、頗有活潑、然行情則跌漲互見、並不因交易活潑而一致飛升也、大概陳貨各秈與機白各米因本街活潑、客化亦貪、價乃立漲一二角、但糙米因新貨湧到、各路到頭均活、目產地貨主亦主張隨市脫手、每多來電求脫、經手行家爭先代售、市價乃立小二三角矣、惟糙米甩價後、去化尚佳、計開出沙市糙五千包、機米則有贛米一千七百七十包、湘米三千一百六十包、溫台米八百四十包、由本街內地厦門汕頭北洋寗波等分去、</p>
<h3>調查　中央銀行經濟研究處發表　本年四月兩月生產指數</h3>
<p>今年一二三月份重要工業生產量、以季節關係、稍見减縮、四月則較春季大有進步、約增百分之十左右、五月稍跌、亦以季節影響之故、茲將中央銀行最近發表之生產指數、列於下表、此項指數、去年開始編製、今年又將方法修改、其計算法具載於中央銀行月報第五卷第六號、及中央銀行英文季刊第二卷第二期、讀者可覆按也、中國生產指數（二十二年—二十四年每月平均數—一〇〇）</p>
<h3>豆餅汕頭銷塲大活　洋莊新芝蔴擴持　新黃豆趨平定</h3>
<p>洋莊新芝蔴、近兩日賣買擯持、前日洋行雖有十二元七八角電報發出、但國外至昨尚無回音、故未成交、市塲中拋出者亦寥寥無幾、因年成若何、一時尚少把握、祇有一般專營戶應市、所以喊價日俏、有扳售十三元口氣、以致雙方乏交、新黃豆除城門荳、有小磨一帮走動外、且到積兩厚、巿價續跌五六分外、餘轉平定、銷塲亦懈淡、統巿計開各豆三四千包、前途亦未可樂觀、豆餅汕頭帮績見活動、行情漲一二分成交各廠四牌餅一萬七八千片云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新蜜棗到貨仍少</h3>
<p>蜜棗出新以來、因今年產區收成歉薄、棗坯成本較昂、故近日嘉興蘭谿等處來貨仍少、市勢漸趨平定、查往年蘭　出品本在嘉興貨之上、但現來貨較遜、昨市　　禿　開三十五元、與嘉興貨同價、上上檔照例加退、市　暫定、如後批多到、或有轉鬆之望、</p>
<h3>油巿　白桐油一瀉千里　漢電洋荘跌至五十四元</h3>
<p>白桐油市面、近因有桂省大批運至湘省銷售、致價一落千丈、距今半月前、澳市洋莊尚在每擔七十五元左右、乃旬日間竟跌至六十元、情形依然一厥不振、無如昨晚本埠突接漢電、謂父跌至五十四元、一瀉千里、至於斯極、惟跌去太速、　動亦易、如稍有轉機可能、則其轉變、亦必迅速也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （葉仲勳）</p>
<p>忍耐與動奮像忠誠一樣，有移山倒海的可能，事情還有希望時，切不要放棄可是也不要在情理之外去希望，這表示你的野心越出了範圍之外了」盤納吿訴我們的事情在可能範圍內，希望乃是力的伴侶，成功的母親，因為有堅决希望的人，不抱什麽意外之慾望的，希望的背後跟隨着的是勇氣，是以加德蓮說：「我求你提起了勇氣罷，這勇敢氣魄，是可以消弭一切災難的」，納寶爾說：「性情上的精力是眞實的希望之基礎，一顆堅强的心常存着希望，……卽是一切都喪失了的時光，它仍能保持自己！它自己的完善與値價希望喚起了勇氣，而絕望是萬惡中的最後的一個，這是福利的放棄！從人生的戰塲上的總退却，」祗要我們的希望沒有滅跡的時候，勇氣是永遠陪伴着我們的，因為希望是以勇氣做後盾的。</p>
<h3>吃瓜者與種瓜者</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>西瓜這東西，又淸香，又鮮甜，據醫學家說，對於人身，還具有着相當的滋養價値，所以這些年來，雖然汽水，冰其林，鮮橘水，刨冰等等冷飲品，在夏季的冷飲中，佔據着很大的地位，但是西瓜却還是暢銷無阻。每一個家庭中，還是在壁角中，堆置着西瓜，街頭也激盪着一片的西瓜呌賣聲。眞够得上說一句西瓜萬歲。</p>
<p>都市中人，因着瓜價的昂貴，時常的會豔羨着種西瓜的鄕下人。還有入會時常在說話之間，流露着「鄕下人，眞開心，要吃西瓜，到田裏去摘一個，多麼受用？」但是，「四海無閒田，農夫猶餓死，」這話，正也可以移來形容種西瓜者。作者生長農村間，對於農民的生活，略知一二。種西瓜，自秧種至收穫之間的距離，雖然比了種穀子的簡短，但是若是瓜價貴，那麼，吃掉一個瓜，便不啻是吃掉了一個瓜的進益。若是瓜價賤，那麽，農夫花了資本，花了人工，出售着，還田租，還不够，正愁得涙盈於睫，食不甘味，寢不安席，那裏還有甚麽心緒吃西瓜？所以在農村間，儘有田中，瓜熟離離，而種瓜者，却兀是在喝着田溝水，以解渴的</p>
<p>瓜由中的大敵，是猪貍，狗獾，刺蝟之類。這些畜類，常在深夜中，潛入瓜田，偷瓜吃。所以種瓜者，大率均在瓜田旁，支帳守備。一見此類畜類出現，便招集着守望相助者，加以驅除或逮捕。同時，竊瓜賊，也是非常活躍的。這麼的小心翼翼地，守得瓜熟了，才摘下來，售給瓜販，而取償着種瓜時所費的資本與勞力的代價。若瓜熟太早，天還沒熱得赤日如火，那麽，這一季的辛勞，是只得付之一嘆了。因為天凉，便難得善價。若是瓜熟時，恰逢大暑，去胃暢達，那麼，種瓜才會在比了醬瓜皮更黑的臉上，浮上一絲二絲的笑意。但是白天種瓜時，受的是暑氣，晚上守備時，受的是寒氣，待到夏去秋來，吃瓜者，都已把西瓜吃得膩煩了，種西瓜的，便在閭門下塘，幷且只有三數家。除羅盤外，尚有日晷也是他們的獨、行生意。日晷的銷路，以湖南為最佳。</p>
<p>吃瓜者，果然是幸運，種瓜者，果然是可憐，中但是吃瓜者，若可憐着種瓜者，而不吃西瓜，那可又是糟糕，那不啻是切斷了種瓜者的生命錢。因此，每年當西瓜上市時，「吃瓜乎？種瓜人太可憐了。」「不吃瓜乎？種瓜人將何以為生？」在我的腦海中，總是不住地盤旋着，這麽二個矛盾，而不能不承認為相當合理的二個見解。</p>
<h3>天然的冷藏箱</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在科學不甚發達的時候，六月裏吃泳，眞欲呌人視為驚天動地萬不可能的事。可是現在呢，合乎衛生的有機器冰；用於冷凍的有寒冬保存着的天然冰；因冰而連帶產生的，有「冰洪淋」「刨冰」等類。在暑天凉爽心脾，冰倒是都市裏各家缺不掉的一件東西。</p>
<p>在從前沒有機器冰，也不知道保管天然冰的方法，人家把井水是當做冷藏箱一般。因為井水深在地底，比一般水溫度是低下。你吃剩的菜肴飯食，恐怕隔宿變味，往往懸在井裏，還有燒了凉粉，要它趕快凍結，也用井水浸着。此外瓜果等類，要它凉爽，也都浸在井水中，你們看幷水在暑天，豈不是和現今的冷藏箱一般功用嗎！而且當時各家沒有自來水，倘使離河道較遠，差不多家鑿一井，用做洗衣濯菜，所以這天然的冷藏箱，倒也很普遍的。在我幼小的時候，暑天要冷食，倒全靠這井水咧！</p>
<p>江浙地窪多水，鑿井並不是一，件難事，在地面控下二三丈深，便有淸湛的井水出來了。從前鑿井的也有專門工人，俗呌做「鈎餌匠」，現在上海恐怕沒有這項行業了。鑿井時任在熱天，工匠一到地底也須喝飽了白酒，穿了一件破棉襖，於此可見井底的溫度了，普通井的形式，是上小下廣；從井底直到地面，用瓦砌住，以防泥士倒坍；上用井欄，是石頭鑿成，圓形方形六角形都有，汲水用一木桶，上繫棕繩，汲時也有一些小手法，汲慣的桶放至水面，手持繩稍稍一抖，卽得一桶淸湛的幷水，不會汲的，撲通！撲通！拚命用勁，水旣混濁，不滿桶。在上海現今是難得見着這種井水，不過你到內地去看看，倒也不少咧。</p>
<h3>讀蕙風簃畫</h3>
<p>— 嚴載如</p>
<p>臨桂况君又韓維琦，蕙風詞人哲嗣，克承家學，工詞翰兼好繪事，執贄何詩孫姜穎生之門，昕夕揮灑不輟。顧所作山水，蕭疎蒼勁，一掃粗擴霸悍之習。晚近習畫，大率畏難趨易，塗得粗枝大葉，便自詡得八大石濤法乳，蓋可與論古法者鮮矣。君於繪事，賴於天性，復從名師，方能悟此中三昧，遂縱觀王息存康更甡二家所藏昔賢名迹。借臨殆遍，故能脫略凡格，不專一家。余去歲乞繪山水摺筆，淸勁鬆秀，頗入潘蓮巢神髓，另面儷以劉君公魯行書，二君皆名父之子，見者咸謂旗鼓相當云。邇來又韓益復致力丹靑，較前愈見精進，爰徇朋好之請，將於本月二十二日假大東旅社，將近作小品山水，並扇面百件，陳列數天，以供衆覽。我知海上不乏同嗜，行見爭相購致，且以歆動雞林行賈云。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　錦喜字重來畫題翠葉　嫁衣驚乍試淚濕絞綃</p>
<p>飯後，夢蘭好像有什麽急事似的，忽忽忙忙就跑上樓去。把房門關了，又坐在燈下出神，他似乎得着一個問題的解决，立刻站起來，把箱子打開，將國器所寫着詩的那封信，從新取出來看了一看，這就有了意思了。接着把自己在學校裏作圖畫功課的畫具，一齊擺在桌上，在書箱裏挑出一張極好的雙料宣紙，裁了一張尺多長的鋪在桌上，然後就在椅子上坐淸，對了這張白紙，長長的注意了一番。彷彿燈下有個人坐着，在向他商量着什麼。所以他微笑了一笑之後，便用筆在顏料碟子裏醮得酣飽了，就一口氣筆不停揮的，在紙上畫了四五撇綠色的長短蘭草葉子，然後再用淡些的綠色，勾了一莖蘭花。其中有兩朵開得老練些的花，却添了淺淺的紫色。在花莖的下面，用粉塗着，細細的用脂紅勾住，便是這幾筆花卉，眞是丰致嫣然。他並不以為這筆畫太少了，立刻放下了筆，站在桌子外兩三尺路的地方，將兩隻手環抱在懷裏，向裏注視着。忽然微微的　起了眉頭，似乎又感到了一種苦悶了。很久的，才自言自語的道：我是怎樣的落欵呢？他說完了，把桌上的畫具，完全搬開，然後把那張畫用畫釘子釘在壁上，自己在椅子上，將身子斜坐了，對了這畫出神，同時抬起一隻手微扶了自己左偏的臉認。由他沉思過了半小時以後，到底是把題欵的方法想出來了。這種題欵的方法，就是到了國器手上，國器也覺得是很恰當的。這畫到國器手上的時候，已經是到了。本來在國器發信之後，心裏似乎又拴上了一個疙疸，這信上的話，寫許人家一怒惱之下，把信送到家長面前去出首。家長看到，隱忍着也就算了。若不隱忍，這禍惹得不小。仔細想來，總是自己的不對，不應　只管把文字去挑動人家閨秀。自今以後，無論自己怎樣的顚倒，再也不寫一個字給他了。尊重人家，也就是尊重自己。中國人的男女之間，達到公開交際的程度，至少還三十年，自己拿着歐西的風俗來作比例，那未免太早了。這樣一想，除了把追求江小姐的心事，完全淡漠下來以外，而且心裏頭還承担着一分恐懼，只覺是有一團微火，老是在心房裏燃燒着。（六三）</p>
<h3>歇浦之春</h3>
<p>— 薑公</p>
<p>曩居錢塘，日夕流連湖上殊未審西湖山水之佳；旋游燕京，棲息旣久，亦了不知故都風物之勝，今乃稍稍念之，頗恨好景當前，等閒孤負，恐不免生吞江瑤柱之誚，良增慙悔也。此如坐對玉人，竟忘眉嫵之美，洎乎搏沙一散，顏色相思，始覺儀態萬方，袖角裙邊都好，而咫尺蓬山，佳人已難再得矣！昔人謂最繫戀者過去，最悠忽者現在，然哉然哉！雖然，十里夷塲，風月無邊，究有何足為他日擊戀者在？吾人正欲不悠忽而在可得耳！「靑山也　揚州俗，多少峯巒不過江，」此間物質文明，自非綠楊城郭所能夢想，而景色之俗惡可憎，疑且倍蓰於彼，此詩宜可借詠焉。</p>
<p>江南舊稱銷魂之地，鄙諺復以天堂喻蘇杭，晚近迺由上海取而代之。在昔黃歇春申，蕞爾下邑，疥處海隅，非風景之區，溫柔之鄕也。海禁旣開，夷舶雲集，於是百廢俱興，五方雜處，儼然東方之唯一大商埠矣。曩讀英人所撰小說，率於美人挪揄備至：譏其傖俗嗜利，身無雅骨；繪寫暴富貴貧兒，鄙陋不文，刻薄寡恩之狀，阿堵傳神，婉毒刻骨。爾時眞欲持是移贈海上　臭之夫！非惟其人然，其地亦何獨不爾？此間無山水之幽，竹石之美，降至園林池沼之勝，亦罕觀無殊鳳毛。春去春來，所謂「良辰美景奈何天，賞心樂事誰家院」者，乃如春風不度玉門關，懵焉　所昭示於吾人，第一任流年暗中偷換耳。余嘗慨謂：一久居海上，絕似放處沙漠中，人烟璦絕，足音亦希，遺世獨立，生意都盡。微獨洛陽名園，河陽佳卉，難得或踰天上碧桃，日邊紅杏，卽野草之花，倦飛之烏，殆亦終歲耳無聞目無見焉。甚至白楊衰草，楓葉蘆花，乃亦珍異同於姹紫嫣紅，肥環瘦燕。九十韶光，匆匆已逝，春終不到人間。所可得而胡亂猜詳，仔細領略者，一般情懷，異樣滋味，似猶拜賜於簾外潺潺，小樓春雨，尊前冉冉，昨夜東風雨。嗟乎！此蘇子卿臥冰　雪之塞外生活也！萬種閒愁，寂寞誰語，其苦悶可想。昔拿翁謂字典中無難字，余意上海人之字典中乃無春字!</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>從貧民窟歸來</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>暑天是一個疫鬼橫行，病魔猖獗的可怕季節；日常飲食起居，只要一不小心，就會致病的。所以在這個時候，要保康健而减少危險者，首先應該注意淸潔衛生，不論吃的，用的，穿的，以及起臥動定，都要隨時小心，則方能减少疼病侵入的機會。</p>
<p>尤其是一般在生活綫上掙扎的貧民，他們的生活旣沒有規定，動定又有乖常例，衛生常識更其缺乏；所在每年一個夏天的過去，根據報紙的紀載，及衛生當局的就計，死喪的數目要算貧民最多。因此，我常常想，並且常常希望，衛生運動應該急不容緩地深人到貧民層裏去才好。</p>
<p>自己在都巿裏度着極繁華的生活，對於那些被摒在都巿圈外的貧民生活情形，可以說是十分隔膜的；而且，如果將我們的生活，和他們的生活對比起來，那末，我會疑心自己和他們是在兩個世界裏存在着。</p>
<p>「怎樣能够使他們的生活也和我們一樣呢」？昨天，我從貧民窟裏巡視歸來後，忽然發生了這樣的感想。但最後，我自己也承認了我這種意識是錯誤的；因為這是根本不可能的事情啊！</p>
<p>這些地方，莫說呌我去生活，卽使在平時要請我去逗遛一兩個鐘頭也是辦不到的；可是昨日我為了職務關係，終於在那兒視察了是足有兩小時之久，並且對於每一個齷齪的角落裏，我都曾經去仔細地分析了一番。</p>
<p>那裏，沒有巍峨的洋樓，沒有光滑的柏油馬路，更沒有流綫型的摩托卡；這裏祗有一羣被大都會裏的人們遺忘了的貧民。—一條淺狹的小河流，環繞着一個陰濕的荒灘，荒灘上參差地擠着七八十間短茅蓬子，一些女人和孩子就在門前曠地上，或茅蓬簷下悠閒地工作着，玩要着。至於這些茅蓬子的構造是非常的滑稽而且簡陋的，許多人家丟棄在垃圾堆裏的破缸爿，破鉛皮，都可作他們建築的原料，也有把一條破艒船拖到岸上，就算了一間屋子。而且一般茅蓬子大都是又矮又小的；說它是房屋實在不像，說它是鷄房狗舍倒有點兒彷彿，旣沒有窗洞，也沒有後門，如果不幸而發生起火災來，我眞要代他担心呢？</p>
<p>小河流裏，　剩了一些汚濁不堪的底水一種臭穢之氣常常會從河底裏騰起來，隨着風在空氣裏散怖着，周遭的曠地上，也蒸發着一陣大小便的氣息，使我聞到子幾决的打惡心要想嘔出來。許多蛟虫和紅頭蒼蠅，彷彿似軍營裏的兵士般的，毫沒有秩序地在那兒操演。　他們吃的水，就是在那小河流的最深的一段裏汲起來的，淘米洗東西也就在那裏。孩子們都裸露着身體，女人們也有穿一件馬甲，也有穿一件破而髒的短衫，也有袒裡着上身而祗帶一個肚兜的。但都齷齪得像一個泥菩薩一樣了。</p>
<p>然而，我去問問他們，很使我驚奇的；他們不但安於這種生活，而且對於這種環境也並未有不滿的表示，於是，我纔明白一個人只要能安於自己的現實生活，那末隨便什麼惡劣的環境都能够滿足的，反之，則縱使到天堂裏去也會感到不滿。</p>
<p>不過，我對他們這種不衛生的習慣，覺得非要改善不可……</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<h3>我們應及早治療性障碍症</h3>
<p>由手淫所惹成的種種惡果，眞是指不勝屈了。神經衰弱症與性的障碍症，同樣為犯有手淫癖的靑年所最易罹患的病症。不過本症的發生，缺乏性的知識的人們，是最容易妄斷的。現在我們就對於這種重要事項，叙述一二，貢獻給現代靑年們！未嘗不是切合需要的一件事。</p>
<p>結婚是人生的大事，結婚與性的生活，更有不可分離的關係。所以婚前如有頑固不愈的的淋症，和因手淫而致衰弱發育不全的顯示，或因遺精而致早洩者，要趕快治療，假若仍然不顧即進入結婚生活，這確屬是非常危險的。因為可使喚你的性障碍症程度加深，夫婦間不能達到完全的結合，不能經營圓滿的家庭。因此感覺苦悶，以至於離異，妻為因此得有歇斯退里病症，無論怎樣，夫婦中間，總有不可融和的原素存在。明瞭這一層，就可以曉得圓滿的家庭，和諧的夫婦，完全建築在雙方健康而具有完全性生活的能力上。</p>
<p>性慾的機能。係受複雜的精神作用所支配，如稍有任何精神的煩悶，馬上卽表現為性機能的障碍，所以主要的藥物治療之外，尚且要注意精神的療法，換句話講：就是對於不重要的細故，不要多用心思。</p>
<p>本症的促成，旣為少年時代的手淫與淋症及遺精過久而致性能薄弱者，那末如在婚前即有發現這種病態，應該速服以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」治之，因為手淫的結果，能使喚生殖腺素的泉源枯竭，所以會惹起性的障碍症。如因淋病過久之後，則本症的爆發，亦屬難免。主要的對策，必須再以黃色素和伐克辛合製劑的治淋效藥「安敵淋」服之。同時再以「希米脫氏固精片」鞏固精關，挽救遺精，這最根本最澈底的療法。如萬一在婚後爆發本症，無須隱瞞妻子，可以向妻子坦白說明，除服以上述的有效良藥之外，應該戒絕性慾，因為矯正的方法，若獲得夫婦一致協力，效果更見確實。</p>

<h3>特效良法</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>患者張姓夫婦，彼倆咸有阿芙蓉癖，每日須耗煙量五錢，因之骨瘦如柴，面無血色，且精神萎頓，食量銳减。於前年春，曾戒煙一次，然因染毒過深，戒時病痛百出，不得不中途停止，今年三月，由彼戚介紹，用培補戒煙法，服以男用及女用「生殖素」之後，始得完全戒除，起先祇覺吸量漸减，其後約服三盒之後，見煙自厭，竟至斷癮，據云：戒時絕無痛苦。與上次戒時，誠有霄壤之別云。</p>

<h3>白濁的對症療法</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>患者二十一歲，常州人，姓俞住在北西藏路安宜邨九十號，業洗衣公司，於今春四月間同一汪姓朋友挾妓在法租界貝勒路華東公庽一度冶遊之後，兩人卽同罹白濁，先後診療服藥，迄未見效，因誤服劣藥，急性化慢，小便中時滲有淋絲，白液糊滿尿道，如白晝操作稍勞之後，夜間尚欲遺精，同時白濁淋量亦極度增多，兩人鑒此情形，始大驚恐，後由朋友介紹來余處診治，余除糾正其一切不正當之操作並授以攝生法之外，並指導其一最妥穩之自療根治方法，每日服以治淋特效藥「安敵淋」三次，分晨，午，夜，用多量之白開水冲服，每次两片，因「安敵淋」用黃色素和伐克辛配合製成，為現代最進步的治淋良藥，不但能透膜殺菌，且有增加抵抗淋菌的能力。同時因有遺精，故再以「希米脫氏固精片」服之，如是兩月，白濁遺精完全斷根矣。</p>

<h3>預防衰老的認識與實踐</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師譯自德國醫學雜誌</p>
<p>…身體的衰老與精神的衰老必須兩方兼顧　…身心過與生殖腺的衰頹都為衰老之由于　…我們必須根據科學與醫學的原理來預防</p>
<p>為預防老衰，不要只注意身體的老衰，精神的老衰，乃為老衰的基礎，但其身體雖屬老衰，而其精神，猶如靑年者世間决非屬康健，而且精神極呈老衰者，亦非罕見，今由此點，在某種程度上，離開生理的老衰，單預防精神的老衰，我認為不甚確當，蓋必須兩方兼能達到，纔是眞正的成功者。</p>
<p>衰老的原因，與吾人身體細胞的活動，有極大的關係，而對於長壽，心的功能延老衰最重要的原因，身心及一切的器官，如使其過勞，能極度增早老衰，在老衰之現象中，最為重要者，為生殖腺的作用</p>
<p>生殖腺與吾人的衰老，的確有密切的關係，所以如能使生殖腺內分泌永久旺盛，這方能預防衰老，因為內分泌旺盛之後，直接使男子的睪丸壯盛，女子的卵巢障碍盡除，此時正如奧國生理學家司丹那氏所說：取動物的睪丸或卵巢，實行移植，卽可返童，故攝取强壯動物的生殖腺素，以預防衰老，更為有效，所以他高唱返老還童的方法，被學者一致讚許的。</p>
<p>生殖腺內分泌旺盛之後，可使身體的各部器官，皆有適當充分的發育，並能排出體內外銷量有毒的代謝產物，帮助中樞神經系統與感覺器官等消滅疲勞，血液循環得當，可减低身心疲勞的壓迫。根據這幾點有力的學理，奧國生理學家司丹那氏乃發明生殖腺素製生殖素劑，「生殖素」，它的功效，能將藥力由生殖腺轉輾傳達到血液，使全身發生一種滋補抗毒的作用，以掃淸腸壁中從食物內所吸收的毒素，因此即能使吾人保持健康，而延長生命。並且製成分男用與女用兩種。吾人不求長壽則已，如欲達到此期望，必須依照眞正的科學原理及醫學原則，從事此最有意義奇效的「生殖素」之補救，打破『人生七十古來稀』的　言所以我們不要以長壽只為文字上的遊戲</p>

<h3>對靑年遺精者的忠吿</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>因手淫引起遺精，因遺精而惹起有害的結果，已是盡人皆知的事實。不過在實際上，其弊害的程度，則依各人病態的深淺而有着顯著的差異。總而言之，妨碍身體的健康是不能逃避的，所以應該戒除你的手淫惡癖，以减少你的遺精機會，這樣就可以保障你生命的安全。</p>
<p>遺精旣頻繁不息，那末弊害表現的程度究竟有幾呢？我的回答是有下列的三種主要病態。（一）神經衰弱症，（二）生殖器發育不全，（三）全身的障碍。</p>
<p>神經衰弱症，差不多為遺精繁密後必發的症狀。例如頭腦不明晰，而陷於頭重，頭痛，記憶力不良，以至其他的感傷及容易感覺疲勞，倦怠，槪括而成為缺乏勇氣。如在剛發育時而遺精或竟滑精，則生殖器的發育有被中止的可能，同時，屬器卽睪丸攝護腺等，也有很多地因以被制止了其發育的進行。此外，在招致全身的障碍之較甚者，會漸次地導來身體的贏瘦，血色漸形顯著的不良，所以遺精的治療，實在不可再貽誤了，現在醫學進步，一切要講根本的治療，用鞏固精關的方法最為有效解救法，此時的患者，應服以「希米脫氏固精片」，這是我們根據多年的實騐而公認的有效良藥，如同時再服「生殖素」，則已被遺精所促成的上述三種病症，就可很快的治好。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>治愈兩種骨痛者的經過</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師實錄</p>
<p>是同病者的良好借鏡…可為他山之石　促成骨痛的原因多端…擇藥必須愼重</p>
<p>患者張競名，昔為一壯健的靑年，因在廿二歲時一度感染花柳病之後，雖早於五年前治療痊愈，但血份及膝節骨骱之間，時感劇烈的酸楚，有時睡眠不足，或工作稍勞或步行過久，竟至腰背酸痛，而且可由左邊漸漸痛及右邊，或由上半身延及下半身，異常痛苦，張君雖曾服藥調理，或節制操勞以緩病痛，然因藥不對症，故迄今未能根治痊愈，時輕時重，精神大苦，且恐愈陷愈深，不勝憂慮。旋由其戚介紹服以『强斯登氏骨痛片』之後，病狀轉佳，起先兩肩膀及膝節骨骱等處之酸痛漸漸减輕，至服三盒之後，酸痛竟不復生，雖工作稍勞或步行過久，亦不感覺如先前之疼痛矣。</p>
<p>再有一患者呂根生，年已五十有二，因年老力衰時，有骨痛之症，惟彼每届交節時，必大發而特發，平時祇略為感覺全身酸痛而已，發時手足如負重傷，竟至不能動作，上年春彼由同病者之介紹，亦以『强斯登氏骨痛片』服之，約服四盒，中止治療，至今憶有一年餘，從未一發云。</p>

<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）陰萎與子嗣的關係</p>
<p>患者年三十二歲，浙之五店人，姓徐，來滬業商已十三年矣。住在本埠新垃圾橋北堍阿拉白司脫路永康里。（主訴）—肛門部附近有壓重不快之感，已經多年。二十八歲結婚後愈見惡化，且排尿後見粘稠性物質，勃起力極弱，性感亦甚薄，結婚已歷五年，尚乏子嗣。婚後雖未手淫，但遺精症不能避免。（醫時症狀，）—攝護腺兩側腫賬如鴿卵大，有壓痛感覺。尿中含攝護腺液，且併發高度神經衰弱症。（治療方法）—攝護腺冷却，施行有效按摩，服以『生殖素』每日三次，每次兩片，以根治其神經衰弱症，同時服以『希米脫氏固精片』並注射『育維賜保命』每週二次。此外早晚施以電氣療法，治療二星期後，諸症狀頓時良好，經過優良，約一個月後，攝護腺縮小如普通大小，諸症狀及神經衰弱症與遺精完全除去，恢復通常健康大小，共計祇服『希米脫氏固精片』與「生殖素」約三五盒，注射『育維賜保命』半打最近徐君來所談及，云其夫人已懷孕三個月云。</p>
<p>（二）生殖器發育不全</p>
<p>患者襲忠民，現年二十一歲，住本埠開封路同興里四號，職業不明。（主訴）—生殖器短小且有包莖，彼曾用眞空治療器治療半載，毫無效益。（現在症狀）—陰莖大如小指，睪丸攝護腺亦異常微小，且有第三度包莖。於上年冬始由彼戚查君伴來診治。（治療方法）—施以包莖手術由詹醫師主割，祇十五分鐘異事，毫無痛苦，內服「生殖素」，注射『育維賜保命』，復施氣療法，攝護腺部施以特殊有效的按摩，約半個月，逐漸發育，猶未至令人滿意之程度，後來約服『生殖素』五盒左右，發育完成，一切令人非常滿意，特別最顯著者，性器官與原型增大一培有餘，而陰毛亦叢生頓密矣。</p>
<p>名藥實驗</p>
<p>醉心健美</p>
<p>余因民國廿一年冬，大病三月之後，元氣大傷。其時余適在發育之期，病後肌肉削瘦，形成枯血萎頓狀况，且頭髪脫落，月經不調，食量銳减，體重祇及八十磅，胸圍細小，乳峯萎癟，全無健美形態。補藥雜投，收效甚鮮。至上年冬轉服女服「生殖素」之後，經過漸佳，起先食慾亢進，精神振作，服過兩盒之後，面龐發胖，肌肉亦漸壯實，而最顯著為體重之增加八磅。余乃認為「生殖素」最為有效之製劑，安心常服，至今已歷十月，精神始終充足，乳峯發育豐腴，完全具有女性健美的典型矣。（沈健貞）</p>
<p>白帶煙癮</p>
<p>先生：余自丈夫棄世之後，焦慮過度，心緒不寗，乃染上煙癮，旋用「療帶靈」之後，卽吿根治，惟烟癮惡習，殊難戒除，請問用何藥除癮最為迅速而無痛苦？（陳鳳美問）</p>
<p>（答）可服女用「生殖素」戒除煙癮，同時再「育維賜保命」注射，約可縮短戒煙期三之一。担保戒時絕無痛苦。</p>
<p>胃臟衰痛</p>
<p>鄙人結婚以來，身體從未壯健，反較婚前削瘦多多，特別在胃臟之疼痛時作，且消化力不良，故每飯至多一碗半，有時疼痛發作時，竟不進餐。至今春服「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」之後，竟將余之胃痛治愈，而食量亦頓增，故身體壯健，面色異常紅潤矣。（嚴華强）</p>

<h3>防勞集團檢查的再進一步</h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>本市虹橋療養院，經市衛生局及防癆恊會恊助，於本月十一日起，舉行愛克司光防癆集團檢查。要檢查有無患肺結核症者，只須化洋一元，購劵一張，卽可前往檢查。要取回檢查照片，價目亦特別低廉。普通醫院用愛克司光檢查一次，非十元以上不辦，最高價目，要數十元。此次集團檢查，只須化費一元，可算低價極了。這眞是對於市民的一種福音。</p>
<p>可是，我們還有一點意見。假使檢查後證明確有肺結核菌，進一步的治療辦法，怎麼處置呢？在生活寬裕者，固不成問題，他們儘有辦法來靜心療養，可是在一般一天不工作生活卽成問題的人們，就是使他知道了有肺病，又怎樣去醫治呢？我們知道，息肺病者，不一定是生活寬裕者，相反，越是生活不寬裕者，越易患肺病。這頻人，他們平日由經騐已知道自己或有患肺病的嫌疑，可是因為沒有錢，沒時間去醫，結果只好「聽天由命」，病儘管一天一天加重，工作仍不能不做呀。類此之人，就使現在有十分低價的肺病檢查機會，可是明白淸楚知道了自己有肺病，又將如之何？故我們以為單是廉價給一般市民有隨時檢查肺病的機會，還是十分不够，並不能就使患肺癢病者由此可以得救。相反，只使人知道了，使他們平添上無限憂愁。事實上是可能的。</p>
<p>我並非對此次肺病集團檢查盛舉有懷疑意見，相反，對於此次盛舉，可算為一般市民謀福利，我們絕對的贊同。可是，我又以為除低價為市民檢查外，最好，還要更進一步，籌設低價的肺病療養院，或甚至有免費的規定，使窮寒者雖患肺病，亦有得救機會。必須如此，則此次集團檢查，才是最有意義的舉動。</p>
<p>對於市衛生局等此次共同舉辦防癆集團檢查，我們給以最大的贊美態度，同時，我們更希望在檢查以後，有更進一步為市民謀福利的更有意義的盛舉。</p>
<h3>瓜的故事</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>這幾天下雨，據說是颶風的「風翼」過滬，因此我們倒吃了不少便宜的西瓜。昨天賣瓜的經過弄堂時還是二角小洋一只，昨晚一塲風，把瓜的價錢跌到一角小洋了，相信如果天氣不轉熱，怕還要跌下去呢。提到了這，我又想起了幾年前的一個瓜的故事。</p>
<p>那時運住在鄕下。隔壁一個瓜園是同房叔父的。他是一個慈祥的老人，他對我們很好，一天到晚地關照我們：你們不要偷瓜吃啊，過幾天瓜熟了，每人分你一大片。但，頑皮的我們都沒有去聽他的話，當月色朦朧的晚上，我們便悄悄地去到瓜棚底下摘一個。因為我們還是不懂事的頑皮小孩，對於瓜性還不大熟識，一時失手便摘了一個還沒有熟的。回來吃，帶點酸味，心裏一氣倒把瓜掉到小河裏去，還在呢呢喃喃埋怨叔父，老昏了，種瓜種得不甜。</p>
<p>第二天，我們聽到叔父的吵罵聲了。他很氣憤地說：</p>
<p>「沒有良心的偷瓜賊，連老子還沒有熟的瓜也偷起來了，×你媽個爛臭貨！」</p>
<p>我們像給刺傷了似的，心裏儘在慚愧，但仍不敢脫出；這是我們做的。這件事到現在，我還覺得有點疚心的。</p>
<p>最難過是那老傢伙不但絲毫不嫌疑我們，還在傍晚，在跟我們講故事完了的時候，很一木正經地對我們說：</p>
<p>「你們長大了時，可不要像這固偷瓜賊。一樣沒有良心啊！摘了去，又不好吃，却壞了別人家樹種，這不是兩不好嗎？」</p>
<p>聽到這上了年紀的人的這種音調，雖然什麽不懂得的我們，也差不多哭了起來了。尤其是我心裏難過得想把這件事和盤托出來。但是到底我們都沒有對着這可憐的老人剖白，這一件事便這樣地埋葬在我們的小心房裏了。</p>
<p>時候很快便過去了。瓜棚下的瓜都慢慢地長大了。我們眼看着叔父呌了三個同房弟兄來帮忙，把一些不十分豐滿的疲弱的瓜摘了下來，一担一担的挑到圩里賣掉了。這是賣給那些常常走省城賣「西瓜酸」的人醃酸了來賣的，那天晚上，月色很好，我們又關着在榕樹下乘凉。叔父的打滿了縐紋的臉上露着柔滑的，我們從來沒看見過的光彩哩。</p>
<p>一會兒，他敲去了烟稈的烟灰，慢吞吞地又對我們說了，（他心里無論有什麽話，都是跟我們說一個痛快的）。</p>
<p>「今年運氣可好哩。你們說：西瓜酸也可賣得這高價錢，瓜布還担憂嗎」</p>
<p>他仰起了頭來噔着那沒有雨雲，滿是星星的月夜的天空微笑了。</p>
<p>「現在便八成熟了。只要過得五天，——不：最好多過幾天，瓜長得肥肥大大時才股，這半年也不用愁了，什末債咧，稅咧，捐咧，都不妨事了」。</p>
<p>我們那時不大懂他的話，但是他的快樂我們是很知道的。</p>
<p>於是，我們有時也走到瓜棚下面來，光着眼睛瞧着那瓜一天一天地肥大了。後來，瓜長得太重了，瓜棚給墜得很象便要塌了下來似的，叔父是很費精神地去把那摘剩下來的「長瓜」，用竹籠縛了瓜棚，好讓那可憐的瓜棚少負擔點重量。</p>
<p>瓜是全熟了。法常替他擔上圩趕賣的老王這幾天都對叔父說，瓜該是上市的時候了，不要太熟了反賣不脫手。固執的叔父沒有聽他的話，憑他的經騐，如果再過上天把兩天，這瓜一定更甜和更飽滿的，這個，在他上了年紀的人，是認為從來沒錯誤過的。</p>
<p>然而，這一次是出乎他意料之外了</p>
<p>過一天，天色變了。晚上便捲來了暴風，雨跟着便橫吹直打地下個不停。這雨聞吵得我也睡不着，心裏滿煩燥地在家裏度過一天一的無聊的日子。</p>
<p>終於，雨在第五天的早晨住了。大淸早的我便走了出來，經過叔父的瓜棚時，倒着實吃了一驚。怎末那瓜棚全塌了哩，肥大的瓜給壓得破了。於是，我走進了瓜園了。忽地，脚下像踏着什麽東西似的，駭了一驚。待我看見了那是一個突着眼睛的人，雨淋淋地躺在那裏時，我驚呌了一聲便走出來了。</p>
<p>出來以後，從來小膽的我便沒跟人談及這末一伴事。</p>
<p>後來，村上喧傳着！叔父療了。</p>

<h3>催生針</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>各式各樣的藥瓶無秩序的陳列在桌子上，一柄小剪，一支箝，都特別使我發生敏感，不知妻仰躺在舖上有吾瞧見？她常常對我提起這些發亮光的鐵質器械，甚至顫慄地說；難產要用刀的時候便怎辨呢？一向我是用着慰藉的話來打消她的畏懼的。這時候但願她閉着眼睛。要求女醫生不把刀箝鐵鈎拿出來，那簡直毫無理由，除非不請她們來。</p>
<p>狹隘的房間在暑天等於蒸籠，凝滯的空氣中充溢着礦質藥水的氣息，和妻的斷斷續續的呻吟。妻的母親把毛衫，抱裙，溫水，苦草湯……甚麽都預備好了，坐在鋪旁邊，嘴裏不時喃喃地禱吿；「巴望女兒快生快養……孩子快快出來穿新衣裳……」聲音是被限制得那樣低微，她知道我的脾氣不信神佛。兩個年輕女醫生靠窗坐着，邊揮扇，邊儘講着，與我妻生產無關的閒話。</p>
<p>「現在痛得緊嗎，像不像要大解？……」有時那個資格比較老些的女醫生亦掉過頭去詢問妻一二聲，而妻却老是微微搖頭。</p>
<p>這才使我焦急了，好幾次　出時錶來，醫生來了已經兩個鐘頭模樣。從醫院章程上知道四個鐘頭為限，每過一個鐘頭須加兩塊錢。生產拖延整天整夜亦常有的，那怎樣負擔得起呢？」心裏越想越急，醫生常然仍悠閒地攀談着，有時看看我房間裏的傢具和壁上的幾張照相鏡架。我這時唯一的希望是妻的大聲呌痛，因為痛得緊急才是臨產的前趨，這是從醫生嘴裏得來的經驗。其實我又何忍見妻受劇烈的痛苦呢！妻的一聲呻吟亦幾乎從我心坎中迸出。……然而，為了經濟的窘迫……不得不有這種矛盾的希望。於是，我又看了一次時錶。</p>
<p>女醫生不待我開口，先對我下警吿似的說：「恐怕要變難產了？」</p>
<p>「難產！」妻斜過苦惱的臉來：「要：要…要動刀嗎……我…我…受不了的……」她瞪着驚疑的眼望着我。女醫生却笑起來了，對我解釋：</p>
<p>「這是她的痛神經薄弱……，應該注射催生針，每針四塊錢！」</p>
<p>她說的大多是一種生理和藥劑上的專門名詞，能聽淸楚的祇這三句。每針四元，這額外的化費不又要超過我們的預算了嗎，眼前雖不致於付不出這筆注射費，產後的化費正不斷的滾滾湧來，妻生產後想找工作的夢是完全被打破了。自從妻懷孕以來，能够帮助我們的親友都盡了他們的力。以後全得靠自己一些微弱的汗與力來維持這添了人丁的家……想着，我發表意見：</p>
<p>「再等半個鐘頭吧，沒有動靜的話，就請你們打催生針…不過費可能减輕點嗎？接生已付了五元。」</p>
<p>「那不成，我們的定章如此，生孩子還疼惜錢嗎！」她們在妻身投了一個憐惜中含有渺視性的眼光。我把時錶揑在手裏，似乎捏着自己的心。妻每分鐘都受着痛的磨折，她皺眉，她呻吟，她終於對她媽說，要我關照女醫生打針，再痛下去是掙扎不住了。我的心也在劇烈地痛楚着，咬一咬嘴唇：「好，給她打催生針吧。」女醫生很高興的準備一切。為着要减少妻的磨難，我不得不忍受住一點精神的痛苦。許是，這精神的痛苦，有使我永久忍受下去的必要，為了以後的生活，以後的日子……</p>
<h3>期待</h3>
<p>— 已而</p>
<p>幾天來，他們在期待着一個不可知的希望的降臨。這希望彷彿像飢餓者之求得食，又橡絕望者之祈神助，是那末的渺茫。然而生活在困苦中的他們，有了這個希望，也就很够安慰於一時了。他們天天總在做夢：「要是有個消息，說是錄取了，不曉得將感到怎樣的快悅呢」！</p>
<p>可是事情往往就不能如意，越是期待得熱切，越是要呌人失望。郵差每天來了好幾趟，自己的信一封都沒有。但他們却並不因此而放掉了心里所懷着的希望。甚至於在每一回失望之後，希望更像便要實現似地，在心上打旋。因為日子過得快，離所期待的希望，也就愈近。</p>
<p>「急什末呢？只過了三天，人家恐怕考卷連瞧也未曾瞧呢」。起初他們總是這般自己安慰着。他們並且很自信地預料，對之至少須費一星期的工夫，才能把成績批閱淸楚。而且批閱之後，又須再作一次取捨的决定。近來各方用人很愼重，當不會隨便從事的。及至四天，五天，六天，他們就各懷妄想：「或許明天有掛號信了」？然而仍是消息杳然。好幾個「明天」，便無聲無響地被挨過去了。</p>
<p>這時他們不着急也要着急了！「你的答案究竟有幾分把握沒有呢」，「那很難說。作文大概是還不差的，寫了兩千多字，自己讀起來總算滿意。不過史地就難一點，二十幾個題目，僅答出三分之二，說不定當中也有錯的。英文呢，還簡單，過得去。在一篇翻譯中，有三幾個生字是忘記了，這想是不關碍的」。「不過應試者這末多，七八十個，只取兩位，及格恐怕也……」「那自然的。五十塊錢一個月，這工作誰不競爭呢？聽說當日赴考的，還是經過一番選擇的，徵信一共有六百餘封之多」。</p>
<p>想到了五十塊錢的報酬，他們眞恨不得立刻就把位置搶到手。因為他是失業得太久了，故渴望工作的心，也便比別人更為急切。然而他們不能這樣做，唯一的方法，只有聽運命去安排。僥倖而被錄取，生活暫時就有了救濟，不至於餓死。不幸而落選，可就要呌苦了！以後的日子。委實無法應付，幾個月來，他們便在窮困的生活中過日。不過在許許多多「冬天」過了之後，他們很慷慨地：「算了吧。橫豎自己失敗了，就讓他人去做。失業的痛苦，彼此都是一樣的。我們要工作，別人當然也要工作」</p>

<p>世間何物易動心。惟有黃金與美人。黃金可奪匹夫志。美人言語如綸音。你看那，多少靑年遭顚沛。亦為黃金與美人。曾記得，楚霸王英雄烏江刎。他是，依依不捨虞美人。你看那，貪官汚吏爭權位。他是念念不休是黃金。有的是，為黃金弟兄起爭執。有的是，為黃余謀財害性命。有的是，為黃金親愛變仇敵。有的是，為黃金夫妻兩地分。有的是，為黃金頃刻良心變有的是，為黃金失節又失身，黃金呀，想你是，無上威嚴惡作祟。不知害了幾許人。我看你，顚倒黑白權力大。所以是，黃金可買美人心。試看那，自古美人多魔力。不但傾國又傾城。會記得，三笑緣中唐解元。脈脈含情為美人。雙珠鳳中文必正。賣身投靠天官府。一樣秀才不去做。願作低三下四人。休見笑。莫看輕。何非好色愛美人。美人呵，可恨你，仗勢欺人權力人。可恨你，只重衣衫不重人。為了你，同胞手足生意見。為了你，父子居然起糾紛。我想，世間若無君家在。盜賊不至起橫行。世間若無君家在。不但强國可强身。世間若無君家在。奪什麽遺產害什麽命。世間若無君家在。好好家庭不至起革命。都為他，燦爛黃金眩人目。都為你，扮作美人起貪心。試看那，男子十九貪色慾。女子從來愛金銀。故而是，相騙相愛金與銀。多少英雄為誰死。恒河沙數為爾生。作威作福戲弄人。</p>

<h3>陳嘉震昨日大殮</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>沒有女性哭聲的喪禮　十分悽慘　將商討入土安葬問題　費用不敷</p>
<p>陳嘉震死了！</p>
<p>他在生前的攝影技巧是為朋輩所稱道的，然而他却沒有用得其所，他在電影界中是曾活躍過一時的，各電影雜誌的封面及浴裝照片，差不多大半都是由他供給，並且還編過八大明星集，然而他的才能却沒有對中國電影界有什麼好處，有之，那祇是更把影迷對女明星發生迷戀，祗是把畸形的明星制度更畸形的發展下去。</p>
<p>不過，他的做人，他的對待朋友，却是以忠厚老實著稱的；見了人總是那麽誠懇的掛着笑臉，重重的和你握握手，說起話來，也一些兒不油滑，從他那帶着紹興口音的談吐中，係立刻可以感到他的誠懇。</p>
<p>正因為他的忠厚老實，他遭受了二個女明星的騙，（我們並不封建的說袁貂一定得愛嘉公，然而利用他，以假愛來欺騙他，使自己的地位高起來，這總是鐵一樣的事實。）也因為這樣，使他的肺病增劇而祗活了二十四年，便遽而便死了。</p>
<p>他死後，情形很悽慘，「身後蕭條」這四個字，正是最貼切的形容。至於情形及經過，各報已有了記載，這兒從略，現在我單想吿訴你一些他大殮時的情形。</p>
<p>靈堂上很寂靜，到的朋友也很少，除了新四界幾個朋友之外，簡直可以說是沒有，在這不滿二十個的朋友中，這沒有女性哭聲的喪禮，便靜靜地祇讓時間滑過去。</p>
<p>十一點半大殮了，不滿二十個朋友們環繞了靈柩一週，瞻仰了他最後一面，便蓋了棺。接着便行了一個很簡單樸素的祭禮，由伍聯德主祭，三上香，三獻爵之後，便卽出殯，靈柩現在暫厝於永錫堂。（紹興會館）</p>
<p>奠儀方面，伍聯德，胡蝶，潘有聲合送了一個白蓮花籃；三和出版社送了一個花圈；送現金的；良友公司一百元，胡蝶和潘有聲念元，袁樹德十元，袁美雲十元，（這是出袁樹德帶來的，封套上却寫着（袁美雲娘具」）。其他還有好幾個十元，及高季琳，崔萬秋，唐納，唐瑜等各二元。</p>
<p>陳嘉震生前曾經替她們拍過很多照的女明星們，一個都沒有來，也不見有什麼「奠儀」這很使人想起人在人情在；「人情薄如紙」的老話來。有位朋友說，要是陳嘉震帶了鏡箱的她們到什麽地方去拍照，那是一定會遵的而去的。但可惜嘉震已死了。</p>
<p>附帶報吿一個消息：袁美雲昨晚（十七日）在嚴府堂會中登台演「賀后罵殿」。至於貂公斑華，則據說在蘇州，同時連她的床上都沒坐過的前「每日電影」「影評人」克尼「兒」也在蘇州云。</p>
<p>最後接到陳嘉震治喪處送來消息，現已推馬國亮，林澤蒼，崔萬秋，蔣東藾，鐘辛如，五人為治喪委員，以後將開會一二次商討人土安葬問題，又費用方面，不敷尚鉅，設通訊處於南京路一三八號二樓，友好如有賻賜，卽可逕寄該處，索取收據，一切賬目亦將陸續公佈云。</p>

<p>Cai Tingkai Establishes the 19th Route Army Headquarters in Wuchow</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Cai Tingkai decided to establish the 19th Route Army headquarters in Wuchow. The Wuyasha Mountain and Lion Mountain Forts downstream from Wuchow suddenly fired over twenty cannons, interspersed with rifle fire. Martial law was declared throughout Wuchow, and order fell into chaos. This was because two British warships came to Wuchow and used searchlights, which the fort soldiers mistook for Kwangtung warships, hence the firing. They stopped firing upon discovering they were British warships. (18th Dispatch)</p>

We cannot allow this to happen based on our conscience, so we resolutely flew to Kwangtung to return to the central government. We hope you will change your course, make decisive decisions, preserve your reputation, and achieve peace. Otherwise, there will be many who follow our example, leading to widespread desertion and remorse." Lin and others also issued a statement to the Gui military and air force, urging them to return to the central government and preserve their strength against external threats. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Smuggling on the Tianjin-Pukou and Peiping-Hankow Railways Eliminated; Li Tonghua Returns to Nanking from Hankow; Mei Lehe Arrives in Qinhuangdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanking) Li Tonghua, Deputy Director of the General Inspection Office for Preventing Smuggling on Railways, returned to Nanking from Hankow on the morning of the 18th and reported to Director-General Ansier on the anti-smuggling efforts on the Tianjin-Pukou and Peiping-Hankow Railways. Ansier has now changed his original plan and will not go north for the time being. It is reported that before the establishment of the office, smuggled goods in North China were rampant on the Tianjin-Pukou and Peiping-Hankow Railways and had penetrated deep into the Jiangnan region. Subsequently, the office sent personnel to block the sales routes of smuggled goods south of Jinan, thus cutting off Jinan as the final destination for smuggled goods transported south. Recently, the joint efforts of customs, the railway, and the military and political authorities of Hebei and Shandong provinces have further promoted the effectiveness of the crackdown. The large-scale smuggling along the Tianjin-Pukou and Peiping-Hankow Railways south of Tianjin has been eliminated. Now, further steps are being taken to thoroughly curb smuggling in North China. In addition to establishing a branch office for anti-smuggling at Tianjin East Station, the Inspector-General of Customs, Mei Lehe, is also traveling north by ship to inspect the situation, so as to restore the anti-smuggling powers of the Qinhuangdao and Tianjin Customs. At Shanhaiguan and various passes of the Great Wall and coastal ports, they will block the fundamental sources of smuggled goods in North China. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) As the smuggling situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has declined, Koreans and Japanese have no skills to use. They have mostly switched to drug trafficking, secretly transporting drugs into Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces for sale. Recently, several cases have been cracked at the Xuzhou and Zhengzhou stations. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Smuggling in North China affects customs revenue. After the central government formulated punitive laws and strengthened anti-smuggling efforts, a land anti-smuggling office was established, assisted by the railway bureau. Since its implementation three months ago, the results have gradually improved. When smuggling in North China first occurred, it was rampant. The goods were transported using Shanghai-Peiping and Tianjin-Pukou trains, with entire trainloads heading south and being unloaded and transferred inland along the way. When the Ministry of Finance established the land anti-smuggling office in early May and set up branch offices along the Tianjin-Pukou and Peiping-Hankow Railways, with the railway bureau dispatching railway police to assist in strict enforcement, it became impossible to transport goods undetected south of Jinan, and the trend gradually subsided. In mid-June, smugglers changed their tactics and hired people to carry goods as passengers, but due to strict inspections, it was difficult to operate south of Jinan. At the same time, Tianjin West Station also strictly inspected trains heading south from Peiping-Liaoning. At the end of July, train number 305, coming from the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, was fully loaded with concealed smuggled goods and arrived at the East Station, intending to be attached to a train heading south. This was discovered by anti-smuggling personnel. When it arrived at the main station, the southbound train had already departed. Railway police and anti-smuggling personnel then sent the smuggled goods from the train to Tianjin Customs. Since this large batch was seized, the trend of smuggling has gradually disappeared, but sporadic smuggling is still unavoidable. The smuggling situation on the Peiping-Hankow Railway has been cleared up due to effective anti-smuggling efforts. The illegal organizations involved in smuggling in North China are gradually collapsing. Inspector-General of Customs Mei Lehe has gone to North China to inspect the situation and is engaged in rectifying tax collection. Deputy Director of the Anti-Smuggling Office Li Tonghua has arrived in Hankow and will go to Jiangxi before returning to Nanking. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Inspector-General of Customs Mei Lehe is expected to arrive in Qinhuangdao on the 18th and plans to visit Shanhaiguan, Beidaihe, and other places. It is reported that Mei's trip north is for summering and that his arrival in Tianjin is undecided. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-Smuggling Branch Posts to be Established in Tianjin's Suburbs</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Anti-smuggling branch posts will be established in Tianjin's suburbs, named the Customs Inspection Offices. The Ministry of Finance issued an order to Tianjin on the 18th, instructing the Customs to work with military and police agencies to make proper arrangements immediately. The Customs has decided to set up three pilot posts at Nanximen, Xiyingmen, and Shengfang Wharf. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Swiss Reporter Reported Missing in Inner Mongolia is Safe; Residing in a Farmhouse Northwest of Duolun</h3>
<p>(Peiping) It was previously reported that Mr. Bao Shihe, a Swiss news reporter representing the German Ullstein Newspaper stationed in China, went to Mongolia on vacation two months ago and subsequently went missing. Now, Bao's whereabouts have been discovered, and this once sensational mystery can come to an end. According to a foreigner who recently returned to Peiping from Mongolia, Bao is currently residing in Mr. Laisheng's farmhouse a few miles northwest of Duolun and has not experienced any difficulties. The foreigner also stated that there are no Japanese troops in northern Suiyuan, and the area is currently very peaceful. However, bandits attacked twice, but they were repelled by the troops under Fu Zuoyi and suffered heavy losses. Li Shouxin, the commander of the "Manchukuo" army stationed in Chahar, is still in Shangdu, and the areas that had been converted are now peaceful. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Situation in Eastern Suiyuan is Precarious; Most Japanese Troops Concentrated in Duolun; Traitors Secretly Planning to Hold an Anti-Communist Conference; Bandit Troops in Zhangbei Plan to Flee to the Four Banners of Western Chahar</h3>
<p>(Peiping) There are about 200 Japanese residents in Zhangjiakou. Most of the Japanese troops are in the Chahar border area and Duolun. The bandits who intruded into eastern Suiyuan are a motley crew. The previous invasion was repelled with three to four hundred casualties. The situation in eastern Suiyuan is still peaceful. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to related sources, the bandit troops suffered three to four hundred casualties in their last invasion of eastern Suiyuan. They are now reorganizing in the Shangdu area and plan to harass again in the near future. Eastern Suiyuan's defenses are very solid, and they will definitely not succeed. Most of the Japanese troops are now concentrated in Duolun, with unclear intentions. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A large number of bandit troops of unknown designation are currently gathered in the area of Hangyi, southwest of Zhangbei, attempting to flee to the four banners of western Chahar in order to harass eastern Suiyuan. The situation in the four banners and the five counties of eastern Suiyuan is tense, and all communication has been cut off. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhangjiakou reports that the pseudo-troops are massing in Shangdu and Baochang counties, and the grain stored by merchants in northern Chahar has been requisitioned. Strong young men are also being forced to form anti-communist self-defense corps, commanded by a Japanese named Nakazawa, to go to the Suiyuan-Chahar border to carry out large-scale activities. Currently, the situation in the eastern Suiyuan area has not changed drastically, but there are many traitors. They are being used by a certain party to infiltrate the counties of Taolin and Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan for secret activities, which has been going on for some time.

<h3>Total Amount of Domestic Government Bonds Exceeds 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanking) According to a report, a certain financial expert in the Legislative Yuan estimated that the total amount of domestic government bonds currently outstanding is slightly less than 840 million yuan. According to a senior official of the Yuan speaking to reporters, no member of the Yuan's Finance Committee has ever made such a calculation. The total amount of domestic government bonds currently outstanding, based on the two unification and reconstruction bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China passed by the Yuan this year alone, has already reached 1.8 billion yuan. Adding in other bonds issued by various central ministries and commissions and provinces and cities, the minimum amount should be over 2 billion yuan. The previous estimate is not in line with the facts, and the Finance Committee experts of this Yuan would never make such a bizarre mistake. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Significance of the French Chief of Staff's Visit to Poland</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>After the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in January 1934, Poland, in its foreign policy, colluded with Germany and became a peripheral force in the aggressive front. Its relationship with its previous ally, France, gradually became estranged, especially regarding France's mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union, which it was most dissatisfied with. This is because the Polish regime has always been in the hands of right-wing military men, who are extremely hateful of the socialist Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, just when Germany and Poland were getting along very well, the French Army Chief of Staff, Gamelin, visited Warsaw on the 12th of this month for four days and was warmly welcomed by Polish military and political figures. This is a matter of the utmost importance in the evolution of future French-Polish relations. This is the first visit to Warsaw by the highest leader of the French army since the visit of the late French General Foch to Poland in 1923. Gamelin in Warsaw had a "heart-to-heart and in-depth discussion with Marshal Smigly-Rydz, the Supreme Commander of the Polish Army, on various issues of mutual concern between the two countries." He also held talks with Prime Minister General Sławoj Składkowski, Minister of Military Affairs Kasprzycki, and Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. President Mościcki presented Gamelin with the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. The opposition also expressed their views, believing that the Polish government should take this opportunity to decide on a pro-German or pro-French policy. From these circumstances, it can be seen that Gamelin's visit to Warsaw is of great significance.</p>
<p>Will Poland's foreign policy change as a result of Gamelin's visit? In other words, will Poland abandon its pro-German policy and rekindle the old dream of a French-Polish alliance? Based on the information we have now, we cannot make a definite judgment on this question. However, the French-Polish alliance treaty still exists, and it is also well known that the group of military men in charge of the Polish regime, led by Smigly-Rydz, have adopted a pro-French policy. In the past, the main reason why Poland colluded with Germany was because Hitler temporarily abandoned the claim to recover lost territories (such as the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig) and because the National Socialist Party's anti-Soviet policy suited the tastes of the Polish right-wing military. At the same time, the falling out between Germany and the Soviet Union and the demise of the "Rappolo spirit" were exactly what the Warsaw government had been seeking. Secondly, the weakness of France's policy towards Germany made Poland feel that France might not be able to help it prevent enemy attacks. However, both the Polish authorities and the Polish people, regardless of left or right factions, felt that this pro-German foreign policy contained great dangers because they knew that Germany would never permanently abandon its lost territories. At the same time, the military men under the leadership of the late General Pilsudski had always had a good impression of France, and the oppressed masses of Poland had no bad impression of the Soviet Union. Therefore, if the Polish authorities and the Polish people once discover that the National Socialist Party is not enough to be a permanent "friendly nation," then its current foreign policy may change immediately.</p>
<p>G. Soloveytchik wrote an article in the August issue of the Fortnightly Review called "Poland's Dilemma," in which he discussed the future of foreign policy, saying, "In a future war, if Poland allies with Germany and loses, Poland will naturally be unlucky. But even if it wins, Poland will not benefit because Germany will certainly take the opportunity to recover its lost territories and expand the territory of the Third Reich." If the Polish authorities and the Polish people can deeply appreciate the profound truth contained in these words, then the future direction of Poland's diplomacy will be easily decided.</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy Toward China Gradually Returning to Normal; Formal Negotiations to Begin in September; Coordination Achieved Through Repeated Meetings of the Three Ministers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Ambassador Kawagoe arrived in North China, the atmosphere in Tokyo regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations also became noticeably stronger. Although the Japanese policy toward China has been coordinated through meetings of the Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministers in recent weeks, the activities of Japanese diplomatic and military representatives stationed in various parts of China are still not consistent and often exceed the intentions of the Tokyo government. This policy is still far from the goal of unifying diplomacy. The Tokyo authorities deeply feel that the serious misunderstandings on the Chinese side are partly due to this. Unless this obstacle is removed, there will be no hope of clarifying the future of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Taking advantage of Kawagoe's trip to North China, the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy also dispatched Kagesa, Nakamura, and Ota to Manchuria and Tianjin-Peiping, respectively. Their main task is to convey the policy determined by the three ministers, so that domestic and foreign officials, as well as military and diplomatic representatives stationed in China, can take consistent steps. If this work is successful, the path of Sino-Japanese diplomacy can more easily return to normalcy. The opinion of officials and the press here is that Japan's policy toward China will gradually shift toward following the path of diplomacy and negotiating with the central government in the near future, in order to obtain the right to reduce customs tariffs and develop the economy of Hebei, and then proceed to resolve various outstanding issues. It is expected that if no complications arise, Sino-Japanese negotiations will begin in September. It is also worth noting that some Japanese newspapers with a negative attitude toward China have been more cautious in reporting Chinese news recently.

At the same time, fierce fighting is taking place on Mallorca, the largest island in the Balearic Islands. The rebel army is eager to seize Palma, the richest port on the island. Due to conflicting accounts from both sides, the true situation on the island is difficult to ascertain. According to the rebel army's radio station in Seville, the government army suffered more than 200 deaths and 600 injuries before retreating. However, officials in Madrid claim that the government army infantry, led by Captain Ballaud, known for his bravery in combat, is making steady progress and will soon subdue the entire island. All British nationals on the island are reportedly safe. The British cruiser "Galatea" is currently stationed there to protect British interests. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Seville: The revolutionary army now claims to have control of the northwestern provinces of the country, but the government troops in Malaga and Antequera in the south are still resisting. The capital city of Madrid is now trapped in the core and is likely to fall soon. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Burgos, Spain: Moroccan troops arrived here today and marched through the streets, proving that the northern and southern rebel armies have completely joined forces. General Franco, the commander of the southern rebel army, General Mola, the commander of the northern rebel army, and Cabanellas, the chairman of the military government, discussed adopting new tactics today. General Mola declared that the revolutionary army would soon achieve complete victory. Although the date cannot be determined, the enemy is helpless, and the successive victories of our army are clear evidence of victory. General Franco and the troops under my command have now completely joined forces. (Kuomin Daily dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Irun: The rebel army's army in the northwest launched a general offensive today, covered by naval artillery fire, advancing along the Piedras River toward the coast. After reaching Irun, the infantry dug trenches to besiege the city. (Kuomin Daily dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Moroccan Reinforcements Continuously Cross the Sea; General Mola Personally Inspects</h3>
<p>Burgos: A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that the National Military Government and the headquarters of the Northern Army established here by the revolutionary army are about to move to Valladolid (south of Burgos). Troops of Moroccan origin in Spanish Morocco recently crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and arrived in southern Spain. They immediately boarded trains and traveled via Merida to Valladolid. Yesterday afternoon, General Mola, the commander of the Northern Army, personally went there to inspect them. General Mola then gave a speech to the crowd, saying that these troops will soon be sent to the front lines of the Northern Army to assist in the battle. Several more regiments will arrive in the next few days. He concluded that the victory of the revolutionary army is not far away. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the North; Rebel Army Fails to Capture Irun; Several Rebel Ships Heavily Bombard</h3>
<p>Hendaye, France: The Spanish rebel army in the north has repeatedly attacked the city of Irun, but has failed to capture it. The government army militia has taken the opportunity to prepare everything, destroying a section of the road from Pamplona to Irun, and burying landmines in the remaining section to prevent the rebel army from attacking again. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, Southern France: According to news received from the border between France and Spain, the Spanish government troops and the revolutionary army are still engaged in fierce fighting today in the area of San Sebastian and Irun in the north. The artillery fire from both sides is extremely fierce. On the revolutionary army's side, the cruiser "España" and the destroyer "Velasco" are heavily bombarding the cities of Irun, San Sebastian, Fuenterrabia, and Pasajes. The artillery of the government army is firing from the Guadalupe Fortress (near Fuenterrabia) at the revolutionary army positions near Villa del Prado. It is reported that the revolutionary army troops have approached the city of Irun, but the government troops in the city are still preparing to resist. As of the time of dispatch, the city has not fallen. Several French aircraft are currently flying over the border between the two countries to monitor the border and prevent it from being violated by the warring countries in Spain. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, Southern France: The rebel army in the province of Asturias in northwestern Spain is now using the port of Oviedo as its last base. The government army once attacked but failed to recapture it. It has now decided to launch another offensive to eliminate it. According to our correspondent in Guipúzcoa Province, the rebel army warships "España" and "Almirante Cervera" bombed several cities in the north of the province yesterday, namely Irun, San Sebastian, Fuenterrabia, and Pasajes, firing no less than 120 shells. However, none of the shells hit the government army's San Marcos and Guadalupe fortresses. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The rebel army in northern Spain is determined to seize San Sebastian. Until recently, rebel warships have been heavily bombarding the city, and the Guadalupe Fortress is returning fire. The fighting has continued all night. It is said that there are more than 1,200 political prisoners held in the government army's fortress. To the east of this, the rebel army is advancing towards Irun on the French-Spanish border. The town of Hendaye in France is located north of Irun. Yesterday, residents of Fuenterrabia flocked to the area to take refuge. Some refugees crossed the river when the water was shallow, while others crossed by boat, carrying various items. The government army claims to have occupied the Chijon area of Oviedo. Yesterday, two rebel army leaders, General Fanjul and Colonel Quintana, were executed by firing squad. Fanjul even held a wedding ceremony with his fiancée, Ms. Agueda, before the execution. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Hendaye: The Spanish rebel army warships, unwilling to heed the warning from the government army leader that they would kill all 2,000 prisoners, began to bombard the forts protecting Irun, San Sebastian, and Bilbao today. The "España," sister ship of the "Jaime I," bombed the Guadalupe Fortress. Three other rebel ships fired on other key points. In the evening, the "Cervera" bombarded the city of San Sebastian, firing every ten minutes. The "España" then sailed west. The Guadalupe Fortress is full of landmines, and if it is hit, it will explode, and hundreds of political prisoners held there will be killed. It is said that the Spanish King's advisor, Count Romanones, is also among them. Today, 300 refugees, mostly women and children, crossed the Bidasoa River in small boats or by swimming to escape into French territory. The French authorities have begun an investigation and will protest the Spanish government army's bombing of the border area of Piria d'Arch. The mayor of San Sebastian said that the situation there is dangerous, due to foreign interference and a lack of military supplies. He also denied that the government army had suffered heavy losses, saying that according to his estimate, the government army had suffered 200 deaths and 500 injuries. (Kuomin She dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Comparison of Forces: 500,000 Militiamen Fight the Rebel Army</h3>
<p>Madrid: According to general estimates, about 80% of Spain's total military force, totaling more than 235,000 men, have rebelled, and are fighting against more than 500,000 militiamen hastily recruited by the government. With a few exceptions, the newly recruited soldiers are fighting on the front lines so that they can be trained at any time. It is said that as a result of the rebel army's victory in Badajoz, they are now able to communicate directly with the rebel-occupied areas from the French border. The route passes through Pamplona, Burgos, Medina del Campo, Merida, Seville, and Cadiz. However, this route is very time-consuming and dangerous, as it is feared that supporters of the government have blown up many of the bridges along the way. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Revolutionary Army Releases War Report</p>
<p>Burgos: The Revolutionary Army Headquarters released a war bulletin at 10:00 PM last night: (1) In the area of Somosierra and the Guadarrama Mountains (north of Madrid), the government army has been bombarding our army's positions with artillery fire for days, trying to prevent our army from advancing, but the results have been ineffective. (2) In the area of Guipúzcoa and Navarre in the north, after a fierce battle with the government army, our army occupied the city of Andoain and seized countless military supplies. (3) In the province of Asturias, a team of our army is currently besieged in the port of Oviedo. Eight divisions of troops have been sent there to relieve the siege. (4) In the province of Aragon, the government army attacked, but was repelled by our army. (5) In the southern provinces of Córdoba, Granada, and Málaga, the remnants of the government army have been eliminated by our army, and our position has been greatly consolidated. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>An Observer's Remarks: The Perilous Situation in the Capital; Inferior Weapons Held by Militias</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: Today, an experienced observer from Madrid arrived here. According to him, "There are indeed many brave individuals in the Spanish government's militias, the likes of whom I have never seen. However, because the weapons wielded by the militiamen are extremely crude and inferior, they are in a very difficult position. Many militiamen only possess flintlock rifles, and some militiamen even have guns that belong in museum displays, many of which have not been fired for over a century. I personally witnessed a militia unit, composed of both men and women, carrying long-barreled Moorish rifles and advancing to the front lines. We have seen this type of rifle in films about the Foreign Legion. From my observation, the rebels are currently in a position to place Madrid under their control. They are entrenched in the Guadarrama mountains, with ample supplies of munitions and sharpshooters. As for the militias, they are using their ancient, large-caliber short guns to launch continuous attacks, but they have failed to dislodge the rebels. The rebels are merely waiting for reinforcements to arrive, and Madrid could be captured at any time." The observer added that the Spanish government has made various preparations to evacuate three large aircraft currently stationed at the Barajas airfield, seven miles from Madrid. Recently, a rebel aircraft flew over Madrid and dropped a small sandbag on the Puerta del Sol area, with a note attached that read, "This is just a sandbag; it shows how easy it is to drop bombs." Currently, only one train travels eastward from Madrid each day, bringing food into the city. The destination of this train is usually Valencia, but it seems to have recently been changed to Alicante. Judging from the situation, the rebellion in Valencia seems to be more serious than the government admits. The city of Madrid originally planned to cut off electricity supply every night at 11 p.m. to prevent rebel air raids, but this measure has now been canceled because, in the darkness, there have been many incidents of throat-slitting violence every night. The worker's recreation area of Casa de Campo, outside Madrid, has been closed and access prohibited because the bodies of those murdered by terror tactics are largely decomposing, posing a great risk to hygiene. At present, the Red Cross emblem is being freely abused, even to the point where women in nurses' uniforms are carrying rifles, and every Red Cross vehicle is filled with armed soldiers. The militias now completely control Madrid. Most women in the city, including foreign women, dare not wear hats on the street, fearing that they will be falsely accused of being members of the propertied class. Anarchists and communists have threatened that after the rebels occupy the capital, anyone wearing a necktie will be shot on sight. The mansions of Spanish nobles have been widely plundered and confiscated, and most treasures have disappeared. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Rebel War Strategy: Offensive in Northwest, Defensive in Northeast</h3>
<p>(Paris) A military observer here has compiled today's Spanish war news and summarized it, saying that the rebel forces are currently on the offensive in the western province of Extremadura (north of Badajoz) and the northern province of Guipúzcoa (where San Sebastian and Irun are located), while taking a defensive posture in the northeastern city of Saragossa and the Mediterranean island of Majorca. As for the government forces, they are concentrating a large army in the southern region of Andalusia (which includes Córdoba and Granada) in an attempt to attack. In the Guadarrama mountains north of the capital, there was only artillery fire yesterday. Government forces fired tear gas, causing the rebel forces to retreat slightly. Apart from that, the news from that area is quite quiet. According to a message from our correspondent with the rebel forces in Burgos (the seat of the rebel National Government), the government forces in Barcelona attempted to cut off the transportation between the rebel-held cities of Huesca and Saragossa, but they failed. The government forces operating south of Saragossa also failed. After the rebel capture of Badajoz, over two thousand members of the Popular Front have been killed. There are no leftist remnants in the city. Madrid is currently still peaceful. There are rumors that the Cartagena naval base on the Mediterranean coast has joined the rebel forces, but this has not been confirmed. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Virgin Mary Dons White Robes Again</h3>
<p>A Touching Tale Amidst the Drums of War</p>
<p>Burgos/Saragossa: In the Saragossa Cathedral, there is a statue of the Virgin Mary, which used to wear a long white silk robe, resembling the uniform of an ancient Spanish army general, with gold-edged green stripes and brocade ribbons on the shoulders. After the late dictator General Rivera came here, this robe was taken off and has remained so for eight years. Now that Saragossa is in the hands of the rebel forces, who are devout Catholics, this famous statue of the Virgin Mary has been re-robed, restoring its former majesty. It is a touching tale amidst the drums of war. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>If the Spanish Revolution Succeeds, the Form of Government Will Be Decided by a Public Referendum</h3>
<p>Lisbon: Spanish rebel leader General Mola met with guests here today, stating, "I am not a prophet, so I cannot determine whether Madrid will succumb to starvation or surrender under duress. I only hope that the resistance will not last long to avoid unnecessary sacrifices." The General also stated that he supports General Franco's military policy of encirclement, and that the form of government in Spain will be decided by the good people of Spain through a public referendum. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>The People are Holding Fast to Defend Freedom; Ultimate Victory is Assured</h3>
<p>Observations of the General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor</p>
<p>Le Bourget Airport, France: The General Secretary of the Unified General Confederation of Labor, Mr. Stonehouse, recently flew to Spain with a secretary to discuss matters with the leaders of various parties in the Popular Front. Having completed his mission, he returned here by plane at 6:30 p.m. today. After disembarking, he declared, "The Spanish people are now holding weapons to defend their freedom and rights. Their strength is unparalleled, and victory is assured. Although it may take time, the ultimate victory will surely belong to the people." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Nominee for New Spanish Ambassador to Germany; Dr. Rubió to Succeed</h3>
<p>Barcelona: The Spanish Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Cotiho, resigned on the 30th of last month, and his vacancy has now been internally decided to be filled by Dr. Rubió. Dr. Rubió is a renowned archaeologist from the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, who previously studied in Germany and is currently the President of the University of Barcelona. Once the German government expresses its consent, the official announcement can be made. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Paris Echo, the military attaché of the Spanish Embassy in France, Major Barroso, resigned from his position last month because of his sympathy for the rebels in his country. He has remained here and has been active since his resignation. The French government has ordered him to leave the country to avoid complications. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Hidden Gold Discovered in Monastery</h3>
<p>Completely Confiscated by the Government</p>
<p>Madrid: The local newspapers have prominently featured and sarcastically criticized the discovery by the militias of a vault in a certain monastery, containing 100 million pesetas (Spanish currency), half in cash and the rest in bonds and a large number of gold coins. It is said that the vault was held at a bank in the name of the Poor Clares. The money has now been confiscated. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Two US Warships Sail to Spanish Waters</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department announced that the destroyers USS Kane and USS Hatfield were ordered to depart from New York Harbor this afternoon to be stationed in Spanish territorial waters. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Another Proof of Italian Aid to Spanish Rebels</h3>
<p>Tangier: Today, diplomatic circles here learned that the Italian cruiser Savoia landed 100 soldiers in Malaga on Thursday to protect the Italian consul there and the son of the rebel General Tranno, who boarded the ship and sailed here to land. It is claimed that the Italian consul had previously helped Tranno escape to Texth, Morocco. Because the government forces in Malaga were dissatisfied with the Italian consul and threatened to harm him, the Italian government took this action. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Uruguayan Government Proposes Mediation of the Spanish Conflict; Washington's Attitude is Lukewarm</h3>
<p>Capital of Argentina: The Uruguayan Foreign Minister, Mr. Espalter, sent a telegram yesterday to the authorities of various American countries, advocating that all American countries should immediately step in to mediate the Spanish civil war so that the war could be ended as soon as possible. After receiving the telegram, the Argentine Foreign Minister, Mr. Saavedra Lamas, declared to the press that the Uruguayan Foreign Minister's initiative was admirable, but he believed that mediation efforts could not be effective until the Spanish rebels were recognized as belligerents. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Spanish civil war, after the Uruguayan Foreign Minister, Mr. Espalter, suggested yesterday that all American countries should immediately step in to mediate, the State Department here felt quite indifferent. Although the Undersecretary of State, Mr. Phillips, told the Uruguayan Minister, Mr. Richling, that the US government would give careful study to his country's note, semi-official sources believe that the United States does not intend to interfere in the Spanish affairs or any European events. This is because the US presidential election is to be held in November of this year, and it would be dangerous to interfere in the affairs of other countries before the election. The government is naturally unwilling to do so. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>The New Anglo-Egyptian Treaty to be Formally Signed at the End of the Month; Egyptian Prime Minister and Delegation to London</h3>
<p>Alexandria, Egypt: The negotiations between Britain and Egypt on the new treaty have been concluded. The various provisions have been initialed one after another, and it has been decided to formally sign the treaty in London at the end of this month. Prime Minister Nahas led a delegation from Cairo to here today, boarding the ship Nile to Marseilles, France, and then to London to participate in the signing. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Egyptian Prime Minister and a portion of the delegation are scheduled to embark this morning from Alexandria. The entire delegation is expected to arrive in London on Sunday. The delegates will be guests of the British government, and the arrangements for their reception are currently being discussed. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Cairo) Regarding the matter of the new Anglo-Egyptian treaty in Cairo, the negotiations between the two sides have been going on for a long time, and the various provisions have been initialed one after another. Among them, concerning the abolition of consular jurisdiction, since the two sides reached a compromise, there has been deep concern that the government may also begin to levy taxes on foreign residents in Egypt based on this new treaty. Rumors have started on the stock market as a result, and the market prices of various stocks have fallen. To reassure the public, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Makram, delivered a speech at the stock exchange yesterday, saying that when the Anglo-Egyptian treaty is formally signed and the government has the right to levy taxes on foreigners, it will certainly proceed with the utmost caution. "The great benefits of foreigners investing and establishing businesses in Egypt and cooperating closely with us are something we have always valued. This was true in the past, and it will continue to be true in the future. In short, we will not tolerate the slightest discrimination against foreigners, either in principle or in fact. Outsiders are unaware of this and have expressed some concern about the government's future tax policy, but in fact, based on the new Anglo-Egyptian treaty, there is no reason to have such worries, either in terms of its results or our intentions," he said.

<h3>Non-Intervention Agreement on Spain; Germany Expresses Conditional Approval; Italy's Demand is Universal Neutrality; Diplomatic Negotiations in Rome are Underway</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's acceptance of the French proposal to maintain neutrality on Spanish affairs is subject to the following three conditions: (1) The Spanish authorities must release the German aircraft detained in Madrid. (2) Countries and industries that manufacture war materials and aircraft must not import aircraft or munitions into Spain, including supplies from private sources. (3) The governments concerned must prevent their citizens from volunteering to assist either side in Spain. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the French draft non-intervention agreement, the government submitted a reply yesterday expressing its approval, with rumors that it also put forward two reservations: (1) The German aircraft confiscated by the Spanish authorities should be returned immediately. (2) All countries that manufacture and sell munitions should sign the non-intervention agreement, so that even private individuals in those countries would be prohibited from transporting munitions to Spain. This statement was confirmed by an official communiqué from the German news agency, which also said that it was essential for the governments concerned to immediately take measures to prohibit their citizens from enlisting in the warring factions in Spain and assisting them in their operations. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The general expectation is that Germany's attachment of certain reservations to non-intervention in Spanish affairs will coincide with Italy's views and be welcomed by the Roman authorities, namely that non-intervention must be complete in order to be effective. Developments in this matter are expected today. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, received the French Ambassador, Mr. de Chambrun, and the British Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Engram, this afternoon. It is understood that the Italian government has not yet submitted a definite response to the French draft non-intervention agreement on the Spanish civil war. Diplomatic negotiations are still underway. However, political figures predict that the reply is expected soon, and responsible figures say that the Italian government has no intention of deliberately delaying matters. On the contrary, its aim is to quickly establish a universal and complete neutrality agreement. (Neutrality here means recognizing both the Spanish government and the rebels as equal belligerent groups.) Furthermore, Prime Minister Mussolini, who was taking a short break in Rimini, returned to the capital to attend to his duties this afternoon. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the French draft non-intervention agreement, the German government has approved it in principle but has put forward several reservations. Newspapers say that Germany's response is still satisfactory, but they are eager to know the scope of the reservations before commenting. They are also looking forward to Italy's swift response. Regarding this matter, Le Petit Parisien reported that the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ciano, will submit his country's definite response to the French Ambassador, Mr. de Chambrun, today or tomorrow. The right-wing newspapers, commenting on Italy's attitude, believe that the French masses are currently putting increasing pressure on the Blum government, which may suddenly make a rash decision and not be restrained. This is what Italy is deeply worried about. Le Jour mentioned the trip to Spain by the General Secretary of the Unified General Confederation of Labor, Mr. Stonehouse, saying, "We can understand why Italy and Portugal put forward reservations on the non-intervention agreement by looking at Stonehouse's trip." The left-wing newspapers expressed impatience with the hesitation and delay of the democratic countries, and their tireless waiting for other countries to respond. Many said that Germany's reservations would allow it to continue to interfere in the Spanish civil war. Among them, the Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, stated, "Would our ministers not carefully read the records of the atrocities of burning and killing after the fall of the city of Badajoz in Spain? It must be known that the Spanish rebels are currently being supplied with weapons by fascist countries, while our country does not allow the Spanish Republican government to possess defensive weapons, which is why the city of Badajoz was lost. Does the authorities want this kind of thing to happen again? If our French Republic is willing to be slaughtered and allow peace to suffer a fatal blow, then so be it. Otherwise, we must rise up and break this blockade." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the French draft non-intervention agreement, the German government submitted a reply yesterday, agreeing to participate, but with several reservations. As for the Italian government, it has not yet made any statement. The Conservative newspapers here are silent and refrain from criticism, while the Liberal newspapers express impatience with Italy's delays. Among them, The News Chronicle stated, "The British and French governments must jointly set a date as the deadline for Italy and Germany to submit satisfactory replies, and they should announce that if they do not reply by the deadline, Britain and France may assist the Spanish government without any restrictions." The Manchester Guardian stated, "The Spanish police recently seized a large number of German documents, all of which were correspondence between the local branches of the German National Socialist Party in Spain and secret orders issued by the Berlin headquarters to the Party's General Office in Barcelona, Spain. These documents prove that the political conspiracies and smuggling activities carried out by the National Socialist Party members in Spain have indeed received the assistance of German officials, especially personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Government Strongly Supports France; Agreement to be Reached Soon</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden will return to the Foreign Office tomorrow afternoon to resume his duties after a short break in Yorkshire. In the meantime, Sir Halifax is acting as Foreign Secretary. Sir Halifax has been in close contact with Eden on the Spanish situation. The important steps taken by the British government on Saturday were discussed with Eden in advance. These steps by the British government aim to establish a non-intervention agreement on the Spanish civil war as soon as possible. Although the governments of Italy and Germany have both expressed their approval in principle of France's non-intervention proposal, the full text of the agreement has not yet been agreed upon. The British government's attitude towards the agreement was clarified in a statement issued on Saturday. The statement announced that the British and French governments had fully agreed with the full text of France's proposal to ban the shipment of munitions to Spain, which would take effect as soon as notes of approval were received from the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia. The Russian and Portuguese governments have already sent letters of approval, but the Portuguese government has attached reservations. The British government is also exerting efforts in Rome and Berlin to support France's proposal so that the agreement can be established soon. The statement on Saturday also stated that since the outbreak of the Spanish rebellion, the British authorities have never issued licenses allowing the shipment of munitions to Spain. After consulting with various countries, they will also find ways to prohibit civilian aircraft from flying to Spain. The British government's admonition to the British public not to assist either side in the Spanish civil war was welcomed by all newspapers. The news that civilian aircraft flew from Britain to Spain to support both sides of the conflict last week caused great unease, but the government had no way to prevent it. According to today's announcement, the relevant administrative departments are now seeking to ensure that the spirit of Saturday's warning statement is implemented to curb actions that contradict the government's desired goals. The Times said that Britain's actions were indeed clarifying the atmosphere in Europe and making the issue of intervention and non-intervention clearer. It also said that any country that delays the negotiation of a non-intervention agreement, or any country whose actions jeopardize the non-intervention proposal, risks dividing Europe into two opposing camps.

<h3>British Undersecretary of State Visits French Diplomatic Authorities</h3>
<p>Informing of the Results of the Talks in Berlin</p>
<p>(Paris) Sir Vansittart, the British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, visited the Olympic Games in Berlin and took the opportunity to hold talks with the German leader Hitler and other authorities. He left Berlin for France yesterday, intending to rest in the province of Brittany in the west for a few days. He stopped here briefly and was received by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Delbos, with the British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk, also in attendance. During the meeting, Sir Vansittart informed Mr. Delbos of the results of the talks in Berlin and also discussed the situation of concluding a non-intervention agreement. According to official sources, the Spanish government has released all the German pilots who were previously detained, and part of Germany's demands has been met, so the non-intervention issue should be resolved quickly. (Germany's document has already been sent, see separate telegram.) Furthermore, Mr. Delbos also received the Spanish Ambassador, Mr. Albornoz, this afternoon to discuss the Spanish situation.

<h3>Hurricane Damage in the Philippines; More Severe Damage in the North</h3>
<p>(Manila) At the end of last week, a hurricane struck northern Luzon Island, with no fewer than eleven fatalities. The extent of the damage has not yet been determined. In addition to blowing down many houses, the hurricane also damaged crops, so residents in the affected areas are at risk of hunger. At the height of the storm, the American survey ship Fathomer was blown aground. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Pacific Institute Discusses the Issue of Safeguarding the Security of the Philippines; Japan Still Holds to the Principle of Maximum Common Naval Limits; British Representative Hopes for the Realization of an Anglo-American Alliance</h3>
<p>Yosemite, California, USA: The Pacific Institute discussed the Philippine issue this morning. The Japanese representative declared that Japan had never paid attention to the Philippines and was surprised that there was suddenly a discussion of whether the Filipinos could defend themselves. However, the discussion proceeded as usual. The representatives agreed that the only effective way to protect the Philippines was to sign an international treaty guaranteeing the Philippines' permanent neutrality, but the Philippines itself should also strictly adhere to neutrality. The representatives also believed that naval shipbuilding competition was inevitable, but a naval war between the major powers was definitely impossible. From a specialized military strategy perspective, a Pacific war was definitely impossible, as the US naval power can only reach Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands, the British naval power is limited to Singapore, and Japan is limited to the area around its home base. The British representative, Mr. Smith, declared to the conference this afternoon that the American recovery policy was disappointing, and that the American isolation policy was temporary or permanent. If it was temporary, then the United States should still actively participate in the international economic recovery movement in the future. The only reason the British hoped for an Anglo-American alliance was that the United States could use its full strength to maintain world peace and jointly restore world prosperity. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<p>The Yosemite Pacific Conference held a round table conference from the 17th to discuss the international repercussions of the American recovery movement. Representatives from Britain, the United States, and Japan heatedly discussed issues from safeguarding the security of the Philippines to naval issues. Regarding safeguarding the security of the Philippines, Japan was not very concerned. However, on the naval issue, Japan insisted on the so-called principle of maximum common limits and did not make any concessions. (Allied, 17th)</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Policy - Consistently Maintaining the Franco-Polish Alliance - Chief of Staff of the French Army Returns Home</h3>
<p>Warsaw - The Chief of Staff of the French Army, General Gamelin, was escorted by the Chief of Staff of the Polish Army, General Stachiewicz, to Krakow last night. This morning, they paid their respects at the tomb of the late Marshal Piłsudski, laying a wreath to express their admiration. Subsequently, General Stachiewicz hosted a luncheon. At 9:25 PM, they departed from the city by car, heading to Vienna and then back to Paris. Before departing, he told people that he was very satisfied to have met with the leaders of the Polish Army and discussed various matters. It is reported that General Gamelin met with Inspector-General of the Army, General Rydz-Śmigły, several times during his visit. It is said that the discussions covered more than one topic, including the impact of Germany's advance into the Rhineland on March 7th on the Franco-Polish defensive alliance. Military sources claim that General Rydz-Śmigły is eager to strengthen Poland's national defense and discussed concrete methods for doing so with General Gamelin at length. Furthermore, it is widely rumored that the Chief of Staff of the Romanian Army, General Sasonovici, will also visit soon. In general opinion, Poland's foreign policy is consistently based on alliances separately established with France and Romania. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Recently, all large and small shipyards in Japan have been very busy due to the prosperous state of the shipbuilding industry. The total tonnage of ships under construction and nearing completion in various shipyards is approximately 700,000 tons or more.

This demonstrates the astonishing achievements of Japan's shipbuilding industry in a short period of time. The ships built in the past four years can be categorized by ship type as follows: 14 small ships under 4,000 tons, 22 medium-sized ships between 4,000 and 7,000 tons, 21 large ships between 7,000 and 10,000 tons, and 14 ships over 10,000 tons.

<h3>Oath-Taking Ceremony for Guangdong Officials - Original Speech of Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Guangdong party, government, and military officials held an oath-taking ceremony on the morning of the 17th. Chairman Chiang, representing the Central Committee, personally supervised the oath-taking and delivered a speech. The original speech is as follows: "Comrades, today we, the Guangdong party affairs, political, and military committee comrades, are jointly taking the oath of office at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. I, Zhongzheng, under the command of the Central Committee, am personally here to supervise the oath-taking and participate in this grand ceremony. To meet with so many comrades who have been apart for ten years reminds me of the various things from ten years ago, like a traveler returning home, with indescribable emotions. As you all know, today's grand gathering is a memorial to the revolutionary base regaining the true leadership of our party. It is the result of Commander Yu leading the army, navy, and air force soldiers and comrades through all kinds of hardships to correct the chaos and reverse the wrong. It is also the starting point for our future efforts to create a unified China. It is truly a very rare grand gathering. I, Zhongzheng, would like to take this opportunity to share my thoughts, our hopes for the party, government, and military in the future, and how we should strive to achieve them. First of all, I can say that Guangdong is not only Guangdong of China but also Guangdong of the Chinese Kuomintang. Guangdong has an inseparable relationship with the Chinese National Revolution. Our late Premier spent his entire revolutionary life of forty years basing himself solely in Guangdong. Before the establishment of the Republic of China, he fought against the Manchurian Qing government. After the founding of the Republic, he fought bitterly against rebels and separatist warlords. During that time, he endured countless hardships, dangers, and pain. Unfortunately, after the reorganization of our party in the thirteenth year of the Republic, in the fourteenth year, the Premier departed us and passed away. In the years before the Premier's death, Guangdong was in a state of disarray due to separatism and division. Countless warlords controlled the finances and provincial government. Armies from various provinces treated Guangdong as a territory to be arbitrarily divided, reducing the people to abject poverty. The people of Guangdong could not distinguish whether this was a revolution or warlordism. These rebels and warlords completely disregarded the Premier's orders, only asking the Premier for funds and weapons, making various demands, even making unreasonable demands and plotting wrongdoings. The Premier always maintained a forgiving attitude and painstakingly maintained this revolutionary base, but his inner pain deepened day by day, and he soon passed away. I, Zhongzheng, always believed that 'if the situation in Guangdong is not unified, the revolution will be unable to progress. If Guangdong is unified, the unification of China will not be a problem.' Since the fourteenth year, under the command of our party, I and other comrades, especially leading armed comrades, spent two years of hard work to eliminate the rebels and warlords entrenched in Guangdong, unifying the divided Guangdong, returning the interests of Guangdong to the people of Guangdong, and handing over the entire revolutionary base to the central government of our party. Only then did the revolution have a foundation, and we could wholeheartedly proceed with the Northern Expedition. Since leaving Guangdong, ten years have passed in a flash. Because I, Zhongzheng, was focused on launching the Northern Expedition, I did not properly organize the military and party affairs, did not firmly establish the revolutionary foundation, did not fully instill the bright path of revolution and the fundamental spirit into successors, nor did I pass on the methods of implementing the Three Principles of the People to the comrades left behind, so that they could carry them out to the end in accordance with the revolutionary spirit. As a result, in the past ten years, chaos has occurred repeatedly. Although the revolutionary progress of the whole country has gone further, the suffering of the revolutionary base has also deepened. Party affairs disputes, political oppression, not only have the people suffered, the party members have suffered, especially making many overseas Chinese suffer all kinds of pain. During these ten years, it was impossible for our true revolutionaries to even come to Guangdong. The revolutionary achievements were almost completely destroyed. The entire revolutionary foundation was almost overturned. This is certainly due to the successors not knowing how to conduct themselves and continuously going down the wrong path. But I, Zhongzheng, in self-reflection, believe that it is always due to my lack of morality and credibility. I am truly sorry to the Premier, sorry to my comrades-in-arms, and especially sorry to the people of Guangdong who have supported the revolution and made the greatest sacrifices. Now, fortunately, Commander Yu and the officers and soldiers have deeply understood the righteousness, corrected the chaos, and reversed the wrong, uniting to restore the revolutionary base, restoring Guangdong's glorious position in history. Looking back on the suffering of the past ten years, today our revolutionary officers, soldiers, and comrades can all gather together, distinguishing the true revolutionaries from the fake revolutionaries. Looking back on the past, I am truly filled with grief and shame, beyond words. Comrades, you must know that this undertaking of correcting the chaos and reversing the wrong is not easy. It is due to Commander Yu and the army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers, especially the air force comrades, in extremely difficult circumstances, holding firm to their revolutionary faith, recognizing the position of the nation and the people, upholding justice, distinguishing public and private, and struggling through hardships. This spirit of great benevolence, great courage, utmost impartiality, and utmost loyalty has swept away the obstacles of the past ten years in one stroke. Everyone must know that this is a very difficult thing. Only those who know only the country, not themselves, who know only the revolution, not rights, can do it. In particular, Commander Yu and the officers and soldiers have demonstrated public-mindedness, loyalty, and patriotism, sacrificing their positions, and can truly serve as a model for revolutionary soldiers. This time, we were able to recover Guangdong, this revolutionary base, and unify it under the command of the Central Committee. This is certainly due to the determination and struggle of many comrades and generals, but Commander Yu's spirit of loyalty to the party and the country is especially worthy of our admiration. Even this time, before he returned to Guangdong from Nanjing, I, Zhongzheng, sincerely asked him, "The Central Committee fully knows that you are a revolutionary. In order for you to thoroughly assume the responsibility of reorganizing Guangdong, I want to completely hand over the military and political affairs to you, so that you can take charge and be responsible. I hope you will take charge of the military and civil administration as a whole, and follow the orders and discipline of the Central Committee to create a model province." Commander Yu then said, "I can fully assume the military affairs and work together with my fellow countrymen. However, I am truly not capable of political affairs and must ask the Central Committee to appoint capable and virtuous people to take up the positions in the provincial government." This humble, selfless, and upright spirit is truly worthy of being a model for modern revolutionary soldiers. From this, it can be further known that our Guangdong officers and soldiers reversed the wrong this time entirely out of a revolutionary standpoint. Commander Yu thoroughly demands unification, hoping that the Central Committee can fundamentally transform and consolidate Guangdong, this important revolutionary base, in order to complete the great cause of national revival. With this spirit of his, coupled with the fact that all the revolutionary officers and soldiers in Guangdong can automatically abandon the positions of army commander, division commander, and brigade commander, opening a new epoch unprecedented for revolutionary soldiers since the founding of the Republic of China, this great and memorable event has truly added infinite hope and strength to the country. I further hope that the civil and military comrades who assist Commander Yu will all understand his open-minded, selfless, and public-spiritedness, assist him in achieving his virtues, and implement his cause. If we are truly revolutionary, we must always take the success or failure of the ideology and the misfortunes of the nation as the premise, and not take personal interests and gains as the center. Do not only consider the immediate interests, but establish a solid and unshakeable foundation for the country for all future generations. We must ensure that the old and backward ideas of narrow-mindedness, selfishness, or separation of factions and boundaries are completely eradicated in the new Guangdong after unification. Our comrades in the party, government, and military must know how the compatriots across the country are paying attention to Guangdong's future facilities and development, and how the people of Guangdong are expecting the implementation of our Three Principles of the People and the emergence of a new politics. In this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to comfort the compatriots across the country and the expectations of the people of Guangdong, the most important thing is that the party, government, and military must be completely united, working together with one heart to make efforts. It is not good to be like before. Now, the party headquarters, government, and army must all fulfill their responsibilities and jointly promote the progress, creating benefits for the society and the people, so that they can be worthy of being the source of the revolution. The army, party headquarters, and government must all be like this. There must be a close connection between the three, proceeding towards one goal, and must have a close relationship with the actual interests of society and the people. Everyone must take this opportunity to work together to lay a very solid and complete foundation, creating a model province for realizing the Three Principles of the People, comforting the suffering people, refreshing the politics of Guangdong, reversing the declining customs of the past, and completing the great cause.

<h3>Amidst Mediation of Guangxi Affairs, Guangxi Province is Filled with Wartime Atmosphere, Waterway Traffic on the Upper Guijiang River is Cut Off</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Regarding the Guangxi issue, according to returning guests from Guangxi, the attitude of the generals of Guangxi towards peace and war still shifts with the attitude of Li Bai. The elite troops of the Guangxi army are distributed in the northeast of Guangxi, with new recruits defending the rest. As for the defense situation, the entire province is divided into four war zones. The area around Yongzhou and Liuzhou is the base, with the three divisions of Liao Lei's troops deployed separately. The area around northern Guangxi, from Guilin and Quanzhou to Hexian County, is defended by the three divisions of Wang Zanbin's troops. Wuzhou up to Pingnan and Tengxian County is garrisoned by the 19th Division of Zhou Zuhuang's division and artillery. New recruits have been arriving continuously in recent days, numbering no less than 8,000. It is reported that the first division of the Guangxi Provincial Defense Self-Defense Army, led by Xu Qiming, and the second division, led by Lin Cixi, have been dispatched from Hengxian County to Nanxiang, spying on the Qinzhou and Lianzhou areas on the border of Guangdong. It is rumored that the vanguard arrived in Lianzhou City on the 9th of this month. The third division of the Guangxi Provincial Defense Army, led by Zhang Jian, with approximately 5,000 men, advanced to Nachenxu on the 8th, appearing as if to enter Qinzhou. At present, the entire Guangxi is filled with a wartime atmosphere. The waterways above Wuzhou have been closed, and major rivers are filled with mines. The troops travel back and forth on temporary pontoon bridges, which will be demolished immediately if necessary. A garrison command has been established in Yulin to command the militia. In the event of an outbreak of war, a scorched-earth policy will be implemented. The people are being trained daily to evacuate and practice air defense drills. The Wuzhou Hospital is stepping up the organization of four temporary ambulance teams and one stretcher team. The Wuzhou Hospital has now been converted into the rear hospital of the Fourth Army Group. It is also reported that due to the concentration of large troops in eastern Guangxi, traffic on the upper river has been cut off since the 4th of this month. The people of Guangxi are moving away one after another, and the scene is as if a great war is about to break out at any moment. (August 15th)</p>
<h3>Xiamen: Japanese Consulate Arbitrarily Arrests Chinese, Detaining and Torturing for Ten Days</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Ji Maolin, an inspector of the former Xiamen Kerosene Tax Bureau and Sugar Tax Bureau, was arrested by three Japanese policemen from the Xiamen branch of the Japanese Police at 10:00 AM on August 4th on the second floor of the Lu Kun Restaurant on Siming South Road. He was immediately taken to the Japanese Consulate on Gulangyu Island and detained until 4:00 PM on the 14th before being released. Ji is from Houshe Village, Tong'an. The Japanese Consulate insisted that he was a Taiwanese man nicknamed "Dwarf Lin from Taiwan." According to a complaint made by Taiwanese people to the Japanese Consulate, "Dwarf Lin" had allegedly beaten Taiwanese people, hence the arrest. Ji told people after his release that his arrest was actually due to his seizure of smuggled white sugar during his previous tenure as an inspector, which led to enemies reporting him to the Japanese Consulate. On the day he was taken to the Japanese Consulate, Japanese policemen presented torture instruments such as lead hammers, chisels, and wooden implements, forcing him to admit he was Taiwanese. Despite enduring physical torture, Ji firmly refused to admit it and provided proof of his origins from Houshe Village, Tong'an, including his parents and family. After the interrogation, he was detained in the consulate's prison for investigation. Later, after it was confirmed that he was indeed not from Taiwan, they harshly questioned him about the beating of Taiwanese people. Ji strongly denied it and was finally released on the 14th. Ji believes that the Japanese Consulate exceeded its authority by arbitrarily detaining and torturing him and has submitted a petition to the Municipal Government to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate. According to the Japanese Police Station's branch in Xiamen (the main station is in the Consulate on Gulangyu), before the September 18th Incident, they resided in Xiamen in the manner of Japanese Consulate staff living at home. Nowadays, when arresting Chinese citizens, the Japanese Consulate would send consulate staff to request our officials to make the arrest and then extradite them. After the September 18th Incident, its branch began to independently exercise its police powers in Xiamen, directly arresting its citizens within our territory without consulting or notifying our officials. This case of Ji Maolin is the first instance of arresting our citizens within our territory and detaining them in the consulate's prison for torture for as long as ten days in Xiamen.

<h3>Over a Hundred Guangdong Business Groups Appeal for the Abolition of Harsh Taxes and Levies; Over Forty Shantou Business Guilds Reiterate Their Appeal; Over Sixty Guangzhou Merchant Guilds Prepare to Petition</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's harsh taxes and levies are the most severe in the country. In recent years, whenever Guangdong Province introduces a new policy, the expenses are always covered by new taxes and levies. Moreover, the number of troops is particularly large, and military expenditures are enormous, resulting in a situation where miscellaneous taxes are piled upon each other, making it impossible to abolish them. Recently, the central government issued a clear order to abolish Guangdong's harsh taxes, giving the people of Guangdong hope like rain after a long drought. The Department of Finance is currently reviewing and implementing this policy. To ensure that the Department of Finance can abolish the harsh taxes as soon as possible, the silk and cloth industry, fertilizer industry, cotton yarn industry, match industry, dye industry, rice industry,  industry, remittance industry, Chinese medicine industry, silver industry, theater industry, travel industry, vegetable industry, restaurant industry, firewood and charcoal industry, shoe industry, oil pressing industry, domestically produced kerosene industry, prepared medicine industry, Western medicine industry, oil industry, brown sugar industry, ceramics industry, fresh fish industry, and fruit industry, among more than forty guilds in Shantou, have again sent telegrams requesting the swift abolition of harsh taxes and levies, stating roughly that the guilds, etc., have been under oppressive and exorbitant taxation, with all the burdens of harsh taxes and levies being heavily exploited, causing deep pain, with some items being taxed twice or being levies not authorized by central government policies. Now that political affairs are clear, they humbly request that the harsh taxes and levies that various guilds in Shantou telegraphed to be abolished some days ago be abolished by clear order, so that they can enjoy benevolent governance and its benefits. Furthermore, in Guangzhou, the most prominent and obvious harsh and miscellaneous taxes include the advertisement tax, the surcharge for maintaining paper currency, the business tax on the film industry, theater taxes, the leather tax on the leather shoe material industry, the national defense surcharge, the fees for operating public buses, license fees, permit fees, various raw material taxes on the match industry, the medicinal herb and seafood taxes on the north-south brokerage industry, the surcharges and verification fees on the metal industry, the agricultural tax, foreign paper special tax, joss paper tax, incense and candle tax on the paper industry, the sesame and bean tax on the miscellaneous grain industry, the special tax on goods imported from other provinces, the surcharge for Zhongda University, the foreign rice tax on the rice industry, and the liquor license tax on lower-class restaurants, as well as the sugar monopoly tax, which resembles a monopoly. These numerous items cause great harassment to merchants, leading to the increasing decline of commerce. Yesterday, the match industry, metal mining industry, rice industry, miscellaneous grain industry, firewood and charcoal industry, public bus industry, film theater industry, leather shoe material industry, tobacco industry, north-south brokerage industry, paper industry, salted fish industry, Chinese and foreign sundry goods industry, machine-woven shirt and sock industry, native cloth industry, rubber industry, biscuit industry, steamer miscellaneous industry, hotel industry, pigsty industry, cigarette industry and other sixty-odd groups, each sent representatives to hold a joint meeting on the 10th to discuss requesting the abolition of the above-mentioned harsh taxes and levies, listing the painful situation of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies suffered in Guangzhou, and separately submitted them to the competent authorities, requesting the abolition of the harsh taxes by a set date, and jointly elected representatives to petition on a large scale at a fixed time.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Robbery Case in Punan</p>
<p>Wu Jinzhang's family, a farmer in Nantang Village, Caojing Township, Eighth District of the county, had some savings, which were coveted by bandits. As expected, at 2:00 AM on the 15th, eight bandits speaking mixed dialects, each holding box guns and wooden clubs, broke into the house through the back door and searched and looted separately. After half an hour, they fled with the stolen goods. The victim has already checked the lost items, prepared a list of losses, and reported it to the responsible police station for investigation. Furthermore, Hu Tu, the first squad leader of the first team of the first district of the Water Police of the province, captured Zhu Zhangfu, also known as Xiao Lao Zhu, a suspected robber from the robbery of Fahua Bridge Town, in Sanbao Liujia Wuhu Village, Mijīng Town, the other day, who is highly suspected of involvement in a major case. He was immediately escorted to the team headquarters and transferred to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. It was then found that the crime scene was in Fengxian County, and court police Zhou Qiaosheng and Lü Qingchang were immediately dispatched to escort the suspect by car at 11:00 AM to Fengxian for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Robbery and Assault in the Second District</p>
<p>Lu Yousheng's family, a farmer in Gaoqiao Township, Second District, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits on the evening of the 15th.

When Yousheng cried for help, he was stabbed in the head with a sharp knife, causing him to bleed and faint. They then robbed forty pieces of homespun cloth, thirty quilts, as well as gold jewelry and clothing, causing very heavy losses. It is reported that the robbery lasted for two hours before they fled west with the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Petition Against Police Reduction Causes Great Disturbance</p>
<p>Zhang Da, the new director of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, was ordered to come to Wuxi to implement the police district system and was transferred 184 police officers from the province, who were assigned to serve in various sub-bureaus in the urban area. In addition, from the original police officers in the six sub-bureaus in the urban area, he separately examined and selected 184 officers with excellent performance to send to the province for training. Unexpectedly, most of the police officers were unwilling to go to the province for training and appealed to all parties, requesting that they be paid and dismissed to return to their hometowns. At around 9:00 PM the night before, the police officers of the Third Sub-bureau in Nanmen first united with the others and disarmed, entered the West City Gate, and petitioned the County Party Headquarters. At that time, Director Zhang was patrolling on a bicycle when he met the petitioning police officers and was invited to the County Party Headquarters. The police officers appointed Yang Yaowu and five others as representatives to state their petition to Director Zhang: (1) The police officers had already received training and were unwilling to go to the province for training again; (2) They voluntarily resigned en masse and requested that they be paid three months' grace pay, following the Kunshan precedent, so that they could return to their hometowns and be good citizens. Director Zhang earnestly persuaded the petitioning police officers and said, "If I let you down, I will be shot to death by bandits in the future." While he was explaining, more than 100 newly graduated police officers sent by the province suddenly arrived running in formation, causing a tense situation. The petitioning police officers were terrified and fled in all directions. Director Zhang also took refuge in the Party Headquarters. The residents on both sides were also frightened and did not know what to do. At this point, Director Zhang suffered extreme mental stimulation and suddenly fainted. He was revived by the bureau's doctor, Xu Fenghua, and immediately said, "I am sorry to the people of Wuxi for this petition event of the old police officers. I am determined to telegraph Director Yu to request resignation and ask County Chief Long to punish me." County Chief Long had already learned of the above situation and immediately dispatched the entire defense corps to maintain order. At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, the police officers returned to the County Government to await instructions from County Chief Long and raised three points in their petition: (1) The police officers' salaries would be paid up to the 18th, and there would be no rations after the 18th; (2) The old dormitories were already occupied by the new police officers, and the police officers had nowhere to live; (3) They requested that three months' grace pay be given so that they could return to their hometowns and make a living. County Chief Long, after discussing with Duan Qishan, the former chief of the Sixth Sub-bureau, ordered the police officers to temporarily reside in Xifu Temple. As for the rations and grace pay, the method would be determined after reporting to the province. At this point, the police officers dispersed to Xifu Temple to stay temporarily. At 11:00 AM, the County Government had already received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs that the police officers who had already been trained did not need to go to the province again, and the dismissed police officers could be assigned to various counties for placement. However, the police officers were still unable to agree, so they continued to petition various agencies such as the Chamber of Commerce in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Quarrel Over Firewood Leads to Murder</p>
<p>Yin Faxiang, a farmer from Jiaoxi Town, Fifth District of Wuyi, was poor. His grandmother was in charge of guarding a temple on Shun Mountain. Recently, the firewood and grass on the mountain were lush, so his grandmother ordered Faxiang to go up the mountain to collect firewood for fuel. On the 13th of this month, Faxiang went to the mountain. Just as he was collecting firewood, Wu Caigen, a villager, came out to stop him, which led to a fight between the two. Caigen was accidentally pushed by Faxiang and his head hit a mountain rock, causing a hole. They each returned home. However, Caigen was unwilling to submit and often gathered a group of twenty or so young men to Faxiang's residence, dragged him out, and beat him severely before leading the crowd back. Faxiang was seriously injured and died at around 3:00 AM on the 17th after ineffective treatment. Yin Faxiang's mother, Lü, who depended on him for her livelihood, was heartbroken and immediately prepared Baozhang Lu Haoquan to report the case to the District Court. On the 18th, Prosecutor Lü was dispatched to the village to conduct an autopsy and further arrest the murderer for investigation.</p>

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Four Families Robbed in Chenyuzui</p>
<p>In Chenyuzui, this county, at about 8:00 PM on the 14th, a bandit ship suddenly arrived with fourteen or fifteen bandits, three of whom had box guns. After landing, they first went to Chen Ruisen's house and looted it clean. Still not satisfied, they hung Chen's wife up and beat her severely, and burned her armpits and legs with kerosene, causing extremely severe injuries. They then went to the homes of Chen Ruiyi, Chen Yishu, and Chen Bikun, and looted them extensively. All the families' cash, totaling about 300 yuan, as well as clothing, jewelry, rice, and grain, were robbed clean, and a large boat was robbed to load the stolen goods. They left after an hour. The total losses of the four families were over a thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Old Monk Hangs Himself</p>
<p>Wuming, the abbot of Changsheng Convent in the Yuecheng Guandi Temple in the north gate of this city, was 56 years old and from Huaicheng. Recently, he was afraid of being sued for something and suddenly had a short-sighted idea and hanged himself in his upstairs room at about 1:00 AM on the 14th. At about 9:00 AM on the morning of the 15th, his disciple, Miancheng, discovered that he had been dead for a long time, so he reported to the Buddhist Association and reported to the county government. At about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, the county government sent Yu Yunhu, the director of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, to conduct an autopsy with the coroner, which confirmed the death. He was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Farmers Destroy Township Office</p>
<p>Hu Xingzhao, a farmer from the Third Bao of Jielu Township, Sixth District of Ganyu County, and his nephew Hu Weiyi, Xiang Yanyue and Lin Yuyan, farmers from the Second Bao, Wang Weiru, a farmer from the First Bao, and Chen Wanxiang, a farmer from the Fourth Bao, suddenly went to the Township Office at 6:00 PM yesterday when Township Head Hu was out, opened the door lock, broke into the room, tore up all the official documents and account books, threw them on the ground, and took away an ink box, a stamp, a private seal, and smashed a teapot. After Township Head Hu Jinzhang returned to the office and witnessed the destruction, he filed a report to the county government. After the county government submitted the report, it immediately dispatched a police team to arrest Hu Zhaoxing and others for legal action.</p>
<h3>Dinghai</h3>
<p>Huge Quantity of Opium Seized</p>
<p>The First Battalion of the Dinghai Water Police sent personnel to inspect the Daxing Wheel when it arrived in Dinghai from Shanghai the other day. They found three pieces of "Daxian Fruit" in the second hold. They instructed the sailors to open them and ordered the police to search. A large package of opium, totaling seventy-four small packages, weighing six catties and nine taels, was found in one of the baskets. When the inspection was being carried out, the owner, Wang Yueqing, looked flustered. After the discovery, he denied that the item belonged to him. The ship's purser, Zhuo Shiting, and the first mate, Xu Baosheng, came forward to testify, and Wang finally confessed. During the inquiry, four large packages of red-lined paper fell from the three Taige onto the sea surface. The inspecting police knew that something was wrong and ordered the sampan to retrieve and dismantle them. They were also opium, weighing up to twenty catties. Due to the large number of passengers, they did not investigate deeply. They then took Wang Yueqing and a suspected sailor to the team for interrogation. Considering the seriousness of the case, the witnesses were also sent to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Japanese in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping)</p>
<p>The number of Japanese residents in North China has now reached more than 19,000 (including Koreans). Among them, those residing in Beiping must be around several thousand. In addition, there are embassy staff and their families, garrison troops, prostitutes, and vagrants whose origins cannot be traced. In general, the number of Japanese in Beiping must reach five or six thousand. These Japanese people are no different from our people in appearance, and sometimes they wear Western clothes or are ashamed to wear Chinese gowns, so it is often difficult to distinguish them from our people. However, under normal circumstances, their legs seem to be slightly shorter than those of our people. As for the few exceptions, one would never know they were Japanese until they opened their mouths. However, there are also those who speak our national language very fluently. Among all the Japanese in Beiping, the most noticeable are the garrison troops. These garrison troops often go out in groups of three or five, or even in entire teams, fully armed, patrolling back and forth in the market and Wangfujing Street. They all wear red armbands and yellow uniforms, and their faces are ruddy and their shoulders are broad, completely different from our country's troops, who wear gray uniforms and are thin and weak. However, compared with the garrison troops of the embassies of European and American countries, they are not only not as majestic in stature, but also their uniforms feel wrinkled and not as straight. When the Japanese army marches, they shout loudly along the way, as if there is no one else around. During the winter vacation last year, they openly teased women in the crowd in the Dong'an Market, which aroused great resentment among our people for a time. When the tanks paraded in the city of Ping last month, they also beat American journalists and destroyed their cameras. Later, they apologized and compensated for the matter. Their arrogance can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The next most noticeable are the vagrants. In addition to running various illegal businesses, these Japanese and Korean vagrants often form gangs and go to public places such as parks, movie theaters, and markets, loitering around, laughing or singing. Their clothes are also extremely untidy. Some wear very elaborate Western-style tops but short, dirty linen pants, while others wear Chinese gowns but wooden clogs and ride bicycles around the streets. The strange shapes are endless. Sometimes they cause trouble in brothels, causing an uproar throughout the city. Most of them are vagrants. A reporter once witnessed four or five vagrants surrounding and hitting the head of a Chinese child in a park. The child cried in pain, while the vagrants laughed loudly and continued to hit him without stopping, taking pleasure in it.</p>
<p>The illegal businesses run by vagrants include the following: (1) trafficking in silver, (2) trafficking in copper coins, (3) trafficking in smuggled goods, (4) running opium dens, (5) running gambling dens, (6) running dance halls. Before our country implemented currency reform last year, these vagrants openly used suitcases and willow bags to forcibly transport silver out of the pass in bundles and piles. Our police and constabulary could do nothing about it. At that time, one silver dollar in Beiping could be exchanged for one dollar and two cents in paper money, which shows the instability of the financial situation. Since our country's currency reform and the nationalization of silver, these vagrants have changed their business to transporting copper coins. For a time, copper coins were in great shortage in the market, and the face value of copper coin notes was very different from the actual exchange price of copper coins, so the prices of daily necessities fluctuated greatly, and small and medium-sized citizens were greatly affected. This year, smuggled goods are more profitable, so these vagrants have turned to running smuggled goods, traveling back and forth on the Pingjin Road and the Pingtong Road, causing smuggled goods to pile up in Beiping. All of this is done by these vagrants. They have an office in the Ruijin Building at the west entrance of Gong'an Street, east of Jiaomin Lane. There are six large characters outside the door: "International Transportation Company." Now the business of smuggling goods is coming to an end, and there is no profit to be made. I don't know what new tricks they will come up with. In addition to the above three types, there are three types of businesses that they run regularly. The first is opium dens. Since the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes Involving Severe Drugs, strict laws have been enacted to punish drug traffickers, drug manufacturers, and drug users. Up until recently, the opium dens opened by Chinese people can be said to have been completely eradicated. If it were not for Japanese and Korean vagrants openly selling drugs, even if one wanted to use drugs, there would be no way to buy them, and the drug atmosphere could be reduced slightly. Unfortunately, they openly opened opium dens, and the Chinese military and police could do nothing about it except for a few that could be searched and confiscated. In addition, there are the gambling dens. In the gambling dens, opium, gambling, and prostitutes are all available. The Beijing Hotel on Meishi Street outside Qianmen is the most prominent of these. Since the spring of this year, they have discovered another thing that can make them a lot of money, and that is opening dance halls. In addition to the Jinshan Dance Hall on Gong'an Street, in June, they opened a White House Dance Hall on Dongchang'an Street with a capital of 100,000 yuan. It has dozens of dancers from Japan, Korea, Russia, and China. The manager is Dr. Kim Tong-guk, a Korean doctor. This dance hall is the largest in this area. Recently, some vagrants have also been engaged in kidnapping. Fortunately, the kidnapping of Madam Zhu Shaoyang was solved quickly, which made them shudder. Otherwise, the hidden dangers would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Among the vagrants, the Koreans are the most fierce and unreasonable, but they are docile and obedient when they meet Japanese people. There are many Koreans who practice medicine here, but most of them have few patients. Therefore, so-called practicing medicine is just a facade. They all have side businesses. Because these Koreans are unreasonable, it is difficult for them to rent houses in the market. Landlords fear them like tigers and avoid them for fear of getting close. So they had a strange idea and colluded with Chinese traitors to find out where there were vacant houses for rent, and then they forcibly occupied them without paying rent. Therefore, in recent months, there have been endless rent disputes. The authorities have now decided to punish the Chinese who collude with them to occupy houses with extreme punishment.</p>
<p>Japanese and Korean prostitutes are mostly concentrated in Fanzi Flatboat Alley and other places in the East City. Most of those who frequent these places are Western military police and sailors. Chinese people do not often patronize them. These prostitutes, in addition to sometimes putting on makeup and swaggering through the streets, are not as arrogant as the Japanese and Korean vagrants who rush around everywhere. They are also pitiful insects among the Japanese.</p>
<p>When Sino-Japanese relations were tense, the vagrants caused a lot of trouble. They often visited the residences of relatively well-known Chinese people and asked about their views on Sino-Japanese relations or inquired about their recent whereabouts, which was unbearable. They also often entered and exited various libraries, wearing the badges of the ×× special service organization or the ×× army, regardless of whether they were real or fake. Sometimes they wanted to take away magazines and newspapers, and sometimes they wanted to buy rare books. There were all kinds of unreasonable disturbances.</p>
<p>Apart from the staff of the Japanese Embassy, the other cultural workers and educated Japanese people are very different from the soldiers and vagrants. These Japanese people, in addition to showing a slight arrogance in appearance, are not difficult to get along with. Even the Japanese who run Japanese language tutoring schools and the Japanese students who audit classes at various universities can generally maintain considerable politeness and are easier to get along with than Europeans and Americans with different skin colors and habits. A certain Japanese auditing student at Peking University once questioned a professor for criticizing Japan's violation of international law in an international law class last year, but after the professor explained briefly, the student was convinced and did not argue any further. This is much better than the unreasonableness of the soldiers and vagrants.</p>

<h3>National Election Office Notice: Group Staff Members Must Take Supplementary Oath; University Faculty and People from Four Provinces Took Oath Yesterday; Citizen Registration Forms Collected Today</h3>

<p>Four Province People Oath</p>

Five to six hundred people attended in accordance with the regulations. Shi Bingyan served as chairman, and Chen Junyi, a member of the city party headquarters, supervised the oath.</p>
<p>City Resident Registration</p>
<p>Yesterday, citizen registration forms for citizens in various districts were first distributed, instructing people to fill them out and return them with the deliverer, or to leave them to be collected by the original distributors today. After these registration forms are collected, oath-taking procedures will be arranged separately at a later date. The time and location will be announced separately. All residents of this city are urged to register enthusiastically in order to obtain citizen certificates and the right to vote in the future. Moreover, citizen registration only needs to be completed once per person. Therefore, those who have already registered and taken oaths in their service units or organizations do not need to fill out the form again to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>Supplementary Oath Notice</p>
<p>The National Election Office yesterday issued Notice No. 10 regarding supplementary oaths for staff members of various professional organizations and freelance professional groups. The notice stated that the city's professional organizations and freelance professional groups had previously held citizen oath registration on a regular basis. However, some staff members of various organizations have not yet participated and should take supplementary oaths to avoid omissions. The following regulations are hereby stipulated for supplementary oath registration: (1) Date: August 20, all day; (2) All directors and councilors of farmers' associations and fishermen's associations, as well as directors and supervisors of guilds who have not registered and taken oaths, will attend the ceremony at the Shanghai General Labor Union, located at Meijialong, Qiaojia Bang, Nanshi; (3) All executive committee members of various trade associations will attend the ceremony at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, located at Tianhou Palace Bridge; (4) The accountants' association, journalists' association, medical and pharmaceutical associations, and educational association will attend the ceremony at the Shanghai Public Stadium, Nanshi City Educational Association. For fear of inadequate notification, this announcement is hereby published in the newspaper. Supervisor: Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>Seamen's Union Oath</p>
<p>Members of the Chinese Seamen's Union, including firemen, sailors, stewards, cargo handlers, and middle cabin staff, held citizen registration and citizen oath ceremonies at the Chinese Seamen's Union Special Commissioner's Office starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Yang Xiaotian, the special commissioner of the union, was appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Representative Election Office of the National Assembly to supervise the oath. Secretary Wang Ji presided over the ceremony, and Peng Zhenqiu and Li Jianbai were appointed as clerks. Due to the large number of union members, the ceremonies were held in several sessions. It is reported that a large number of members in Shanghai attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>City Fishermen's Association Requests Explanation</p>
<p>The City Fishermen's Association of this city has many doubts regarding the mixed election of fishermen's and farmers' associations when recommending national election representatives. Therefore, it telegraphed the National Assembly Election Headquarters yesterday to request an explanation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Jiang Junjian, Director of the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters in Nanjing: Upon investigation of Schedule 3 of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, the number of representatives from local farmers' associations and fishermen's associations is four in total, and in principle, there is no distinction. However, the intent of the law is to value both agriculture and fisheries equally, and in coastal areas, fisheries are even more important than agriculture. The hub where fishery products gather and disperse is even more important than agriculture. Under these special circumstances, does the local election office have the authority to consider the advantages and disadvantages and make appropriate divisions to conform to reality? This is the first point requiring explanation. Furthermore, Article 20 of the Election Law stipulates that candidates from each professional organization shall be selected by the executive body of each professional organization. Since each of the farmers' and fishermen's associations is a group with independent status, when recommending candidates, the two associations will inevitably recommend separately, rather than jointly recommend. This seems extremely clear. However, such regulations are inconsistent with the principle stipulated in Schedule 3 of the aforementioned Election Law. When the two associations produce representative candidates, will they be recommended separately, or will they be jointly recommended in name only, while actually designating quotas and setting up separate ballot boxes for separate recommendations? This is a point that requires explanation. The above two points are crucial to electoral policy, and the time is pressing. Please submit them to the Legislative Interpretation Committee for prompt interpretation and telegraph the reply for public convenience. Shanghai Fishermen's Association respectfully.</p>

There is no way to keep him, and it has been approved. The successor has also been internally determined and has been agreed to by the Soviet Union. It can be officially announced within ten days. Yan has served in the diplomatic community for many years and has made outstanding achievements. After his resignation, he will choose a place in the country to recuperate. Yan himself is now in Tianjin and will go south in a few days.</p>
<p>Envoy He Will Return to the Country in the Middle of Next Month</p>
<p>He Yaozu, the envoy to Turkey, has asked for leave to return to the country. He left Turkey on the 17th of last month and arrived in the United States. He will stay in the United States for a while. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a telegram about when he will return to the east. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the middle of next month. It is not true that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will abolish the embassy in Turkey because Turkey has not yet established an embassy in China. According to the information I have learned, the embassy in Turkey will not be abolished, and the internal organization will be reduced to save money. However, it must be discussed and decided after He returns to the country.</p>
<p>Negotiating Sino-Russian Friendship and Trade Treaty</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of concluding a friendship and trade treaty between China and Russia, Chen said that since China and Russia resumed diplomatic relations, many years have passed, and the relations between the two countries have become increasingly friendly. Commerce has also increased year by year. In order to seek trade convenience, both sides have decided to negotiate a friendship and trade treaty in the near future. Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov has negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs several times. So far, the opinions of the two sides have not been completely consistent and need to be continued to be discussed.</p>
<p>Our Country Will Set Up Commissioners in Various League of Nations Groups</p>
<p>Chen continued to say that the League of Nations has set the end of September to hold a general assembly to discuss the issue of revising the League of Nations rules. The League of Nations has sought opinions from our government. The office established by our country's delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva only has a few staff members stationed when it is not in session. When the meeting is approaching, secretaries from the embassies in Europe are transferred to assist. They are unfamiliar with the place and the staff, so naturally, there are many inconveniences in handling affairs. Therefore, it has been decided to add one or two commissioners from our country to the military, diplomatic, political, and other groups of the League of Nations. They will be stationed in Geneva and can investigate the international situation at any time and represent us at the meetings of various subcommittees.</p>
<p>Vice President Kong Will Not Leave Lushan for the Time Being</p>
<p>Chen finally told reporters that the Executive Yuan's regular meeting was changed to Lushan due to the hot weather in the capital. From the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Zhang, Xu Jielong, and Chen himself went to attend the meeting in turn. Since President Chiang went to Guangdong, the Executive Yuan was temporarily presided over by Vice President Kong, so Kong could not leave Lushan for a while. Minister Zhang also arrived in Lushan on the 15th and is scheduled to return to Beijing at the end of this month. Chen also learned that he could not leave Beijing for a long time due to affairs and will return to Beijing on the night of the 20th.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Ministry of Transportation and Others, Please Open South Seas Route: Near Expensive and Distant Cheap, Foreign Ships Manipulate Arbitrarily, Overcoming All Difficulties Should Take into Account National Economy and People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing yesterday: Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Industry, on the 17th of this month, according to a letter from Nanqiao Bank, since the currency reform in our country, the export of domestic products has increased compared to before. Even flour, a commodity, has not been heard of being transported to the South Seas since the 20th year. Now it is also decided to export it. If so, the expectations for domestic goods to travel abroad are even more likely to take advantage of the opportunity to develop. However, the export of goods depends on the reduction of various expenses and low costs to facilitate sales. Among the various expenses, the freight cost is the most critical. In the past, the freight cost for loading and transporting export goods with Singapore or Penang as the destination was 10 yuan per ton of national currency, discounted by 90% or 80%. Recently, it has been unreasonably increased to 14 or 15 yuan per ton of national currency, which makes the cost suddenly increase and the export of domestic products is greatly hindered. It is found that the freight cost charged by various shipping companies for goods transported from Shanghai to Columbus is only 9 yuan per ton of national currency. It is also found that the freight cost for goods transported from Dalian to Singapore or Penang is only 8 yuan. In terms of water distance, Shanghai is closer to Singapore and Penang than Columbus. Even from Dalian to Singapore or Penang, the water distance is farther than from Shanghai. There is no reason for the near to be expensive and the far to be cheap. This kind of non-standard and unfair regulation clearly shows that their intention is to invisibly restrict the export of our country's products. The reason for this is that our country does not have ships sailing abroad, and all export goods rely solely on foreign ships for transportation, allowing them to manipulate the market. If we do not take urgent measures to rescue the situation, the future of domestic products will have no chance to be sold abroad. The council is the hub of merchants and the guide for the promotion of domestic products. Seeing this situation, it should also feel the urgency and seek ways to remedy it. Therefore, we earnestly request your council to negotiate with various shipping companies based on the current method of governance, reduce the freight charges, and make accurate regulations to avoid the near being more expensive than the far, so as to facilitate the export of domestic products. Furthermore, we request the state-run China Merchants Bureau to open the South Seas route in the shortest possible time to recover the benefits and facilitate transportation, so that the future of domestic products will have a chance to be sold abroad. After investigating, the two strategies of short-term and long-term treatment presented by the bank, from a fair point of view, the short-term treatment method is in the hands of the people. In the past, foreign ships sailing in the country increased freight charges, and there was still an opportunity to negotiate and reduce them. The reason is that there are already domestic ships participating in the route, and foreign ships cannot manipulate the market alone. Therefore, negotiations are still easy to comply with. The recent change in the calculation standard of the transport price on the Yangtze River route is an example. As for foreign routes, which are exclusively dominated by foreign ships, there is no place to restrain them slightly, so it is not easy to achieve the effect of negotiation and transformation. Moreover, from the perspective of foreign merchants' national policies, since the implementation of the legal currency policy, the export prices of goods have been reduced, and countries that have a vested interest in us are secretly jealous of us. Their plan to increase freight charges is a hidden attempt to obstruct us, and the situation is even more obvious. Rather than begging them for mercy, which is only met with contempt, it is better to overcome all difficulties and seek solutions within ourselves. Moreover, opening the South Seas route has been a consistent request of overseas Chinese for years. The China Merchants Bureau is state-run, and if the government's strength is slightly supported, even if the initial operation is not without deficits, the overall medical plan will still benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. Otherwise, year after year, the Yellow River will be difficult to wait for. Not only will the overseas Chinese be discouraged, but the international transportation network will be controlled by others for a long time, and foreign trade will have no hope of prosperity. This matter should be planned with all the power of the government. If the China Merchants Bureau is ordered to recognize the restoration, it will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce's request in the previous session, delaying the years and making it difficult to achieve success. Therefore, the sincerity of Shanghai sincerely appeals to the capital to take charge of planning and implementation, so that it can be realized, which is for public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Unified Taxation Investigates and Detains People and Goods; Liang Shao Alcohol Business Suspends Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives Dispatched to Petition the Authorities, Who Agreed to Release Detainees; Bail Procedures Completed, Resumption of Operations Expected Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liang Shao Alcohol Industry Guild reports that Unified Taxation Bureau investigators from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region, alleging that the industry was substituting alcohol for shao alcohol, detained and punished individuals and goods. As a result, wholesale transactions were suspended starting yesterday, while retail operations continued as usual. Representatives were dispatched to petition the authorities. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspension of Wholesale Operations: A total of forty-two Liang Shao alcohol businesses, including Tongxinchang, Tongchangfu, Wanyuanshun, Laohengxing, and Tongheyong, convened a meeting of guild members due to the Unified Taxation Bureau investigators from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi region detaining and punishing people and goods, alleging that they were substituting alcohol for shao alcohol. A decision was made to temporarily suspend operations. As of yesterday, all businesses ceased wholesale transactions and stopped deliveries, as any goods found by Unified Taxation Bureau investigators would be detained. Even orders already placed by customers awaiting delivery were reluctantly suspended. However, retail operations continued as usual. Regarding the individuals and goods detained by the Unified Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, apart from Lai Afang and Zai Ancai of Tongchangfu Alcohol Business, and Shi Agou of Tongheyong Alcohol Business, along with their boats and goods, the rest were bailed out from the Unified Taxation Bureau by their respective businesses.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: The Liang Shao Alcohol Industry Guild held an emergency meeting of its members yesterday at 2:00 PM at its meeting place located at No. 265 Maojia Lane in the Nanshi district. Representatives from forty-two businesses, including Tongxinchang, Tongheyong, and Wanyuangong, attended. He Xiangsheng, the chairman, reported on the incident in which Unified Taxation Bureau investigators from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region detained and punished members' delivered goods, alleging the substitution of alcohol for shao alcohol. Following this, discussions commenced regarding dispatching representatives to petition the authorities. It was decided on the spot to appoint He Xiangsheng, Jin Depei, Huang Huade, Xu Shilong, Wang Wenbin, and Li Guoqing as representatives to petition the Unified Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, requesting sanctions against the investigators who were forcibly accusing them of substituting alcohol, the release of the detained delivery personnel and goods from the alcohol businesses, and guarantees that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Petition to Stop Abuses: At 3:30 PM yesterday, the Liang Shao Alcohol Industry Guild dispatched representatives He Xiangsheng, Jin Depei, Huang Huade, Xu Shilong, Wang Wenbin, and Ji Guoqing to the Unified Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui on Dagu Road to petition. Department head Jiang Jinkai received them. He Xiangsheng first recounted the details of the alcohol businesses' goods being detained for allegedly substituting alcohol. Department head Jiang, in addition to urging the resumption of wholesale transactions, promised to immediately instruct the Investigation Division to promptly report the details of the penalties for alcohol substitution for verification. He also agreed to release the detained personnel and instructed them to submit a formal written petition. The representatives left around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tax Bureau Statement: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency spoke with Department head Jin of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Taxation Bureau yesterday. He stated that the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued orders prohibiting alcohol substitution and has stipulated penalty measures. Therefore, investigators will detain and punish those found to be substituting alcohol. If there is any doubt about the detained goods, they will be sent to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry for inspection. The bureau has not yet received reports from its subordinate districts regarding the alcohol substitution goods detained by investigators this time. It has now instructed them to report promptly for verification. As for the suspension of wholesale transactions by the Liang Shao alcohol industry, they have been urged to resume operations, he said.</p>
<p>Release and Resumption of Operations: A reporter from the Xin Zheng News Agency met with He Xiangsheng, chairman of the Liang Shao Alcohol Industry Guild, last night. According to him, the Unified Taxation Bureau required the filling out of a penalty acknowledgment form when bailing out the delivery personnel of the detained alcohol businesses. Therefore, after bailing them out, it was considered an admission of alcohol substitution. It was resolved to suspend wholesale transactions. As a result of the petition, the Unified Taxation Bureau has agreed to release the detained personnel, goods, and boats on bail and waive the penalty acknowledgment form. The industry has decided to resume transactions as soon as the personnel and goods are released. Furthermore, it was originally planned to cease the loading of shao alcohol boats heading to Shanghai from Jiangbei and anchoring at the Xinqiao docks, starting on the 19th. If the bail procedures are completed today, this measure can be avoided.</p>
<h3>The Daishan Tragedy</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government Responds to Telegrams from Two Fellow-Provincial Associations; Zhang Zhongli Discusses the Handling of the Case</p>
<p>Due to the forced collection of salt taxes by the fishery and salt tax police in Daishan, Zhejiang Province, a tragic incident occurred. The Ningbo and Dinghai Fellow-Provincial Associations in Shanghai, as well as Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, and others, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting proper handling of the matter. A reply telegram was received yesterday, stating: To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai and Mr. Liu Hongsheng of the Dinghai Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai: Your telegrams of the "Zhen" and "Zheng" series have been received. Upon investigation, the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, the Zhejiang Public Assembly, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association in Beijing, and Zhuang Songfu, a citizen of Fenghua, have all submitted letters and telegrams to the government. The matter has been referred to the Ministry of Finance and the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner for review and response, and Commissioner Zhao has been ordered to supervise the Daishan County Magistrate in handling the aftermath properly. In addition to forwarding the "Zheng" telegram to the Salt Transport Commissioner for filing and review, we are sending this telegraph in advance. Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, with two official seals.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongli, Director of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau, came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him to inquire about the cause of the riot and the details of the incident. Zhang's response was as follows:</p>
<p>Centralized Salt Storage is Beneficial and Harmless</p>
<p>Centralized salt storage is the initial step in implementing the new salt law and is intended to benefit both fishermen and salt producers. Within the Liangzhe region, areas such as Nan Salt, Changlin, Qingquan, and Dinghai have already implemented this system. In the past, salt producers in Daishan transported and sold their salt themselves without warehousing, making management difficult and hindering the implementation of on-site tax collection. For salt producers, price drops were common during periods of slow sales. Conversely, when production was insufficient, fishermen often faced high salt prices. The centralized storage system is divided into facilities for both fishery salt and table salt. Fishery salt storage facilities are built in areas where fishing boats congregate, with wharves constructed for tax payment and salt distribution, ensuring timeliness and efficiency. In the event of production shortages, the government plans to provide loans for distribution. On-site tax collection eliminates inspection procedures and other inconveniences. For table salt, the government is responsible for storage, eliminating the risk of loss. The construction of roads within the storage areas facilitates transportation, and salt prices are standardized to prevent competition. In the event of slow sales, the government provides loans for adjustment. The methods for collecting and distributing salt and the timing of these activities are all coordinated appropriately. Claims that salt producers cannot deliver salt to the storage facilities or fishermen cannot purchase salt outside of salt office hours are deliberately provocative and untrue. Therefore, centralized salt storage is the only way to achieve scientific management and is the initial step in implementing the new salt law. It benefits the legitimate business of salt producers and fishermen and is only detrimental to private buying and selling. There is no reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>Fishery Salt Coloring Prevents Illegal Sales</p>
<p>Fishery salt coloring is intended to prevent the illegal sale of table salt. Ministry orders have been issued for some time, and all regions are implementing this measure. Daishan is not the first. As the second-largest salt-producing area in Liangzhe and a major fishing region nationwide, Daishan is no exception. Furthermore, the coloring agent has been carefully considered and tested by experts from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry before implementation. It will not cause mold or spoilage. The reason for the widespread opposition is that once the salt is colored, it becomes difficult to sell illegally. In other words, it is no longer possible to sell fishery salt taxed at three cents as table salt taxed at seven yuan and ten cents. Investigations have revealed that Daishan alone illegally sells approximately 400,000 dan of fishery salt taxed at three cents as table salt taxed at seven yuan and ten cents in the five prefectures of Suzhou each year, causing a loss of three million yuan in national tax revenue. The state encourages the fishing industry by providing lower taxes, but this is being exploited for private gain. The government's implementation of fishery salt coloring as a preventive measure is entirely justified. Moreover, the Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures have been implementing this measure since last year without any obstacles. Its implementation in the Dinghai and Daishan regions this year will not harm the legitimate interests of fishermen, it can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>The Course of the Fishery and Salt Riot</p>
<p>The Daishan fishery and salt riot on July 13 was organized in advance. Individuals who have traditionally exploited the fishery and salt industry first convened a meeting at the Zifusi Salt Industry Credit Cooperative on July 10, using inflammatory language to oppose centralized storage. On July 11, they collectively stopped salt production. On July 12, a salt producer named Huang Bao-ren continued to produce salt, resulting in the destruction of his salt slabs. Li Ren-fu, who attempted to reason with them, was dragged to the Dongyue Temple and beaten. Village head Huang Gong reported the incident, and the Public Security Bureau rescued him from danger. On July 13, they convened another large meeting of fishermen and salt producers at the Dongyue Temple. As the crowd grew larger, violence erupted. First, they captured Liu Feng-sheng, a surveyor from the engineering office, and severely beat him. His wife, upon hearing this, rushed to the weighing and distribution station to seek help. A team led by Captain Hu, along with several police officers from the Public Security Bureau, went to rescue him. On the way, they encountered the crowd, who were bringing the surveyor bound. Captain Hu, fearing misunderstandings, ordered the police to stop and only took Sergeant Xu Li forward to reason with them. The crowd swarmed forward and seized Xu Li's wooden-cased gun. While they were struggling, rioters opened fire, knocking Xu Li down. The violence escalated from there. In this incident, several thousand rioters killed nine salt affairs personnel and seriously injured three others. Many were disemboweled, had their hearts removed, and were thrown into the sea. The cruelty was horrifying. During the rioters' siege of the bureau team, they fired frequently. The walls are still riddled with bullet holes. Even those who understand the situation say that they were unarmed. At the time, Captain Hu responded cautiously and strictly prohibited the police from firing live rounds. Therefore, only one fisherman and salt producer died during the major riot.</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath with Leniency and Harmony</p>
<p>Since the riot, the salt affairs authorities have consistently advocated for leniency and harmony. I arrived in Ningbo on July 19 and met with Commissioner Zhao to discuss the handling of the aftermath. He expressed sympathy for my views. He agreed that the ringleaders should be severely punished, but that those who were coerced should not be implicated. Together with Magistrate Shen of Dinghai, we developed several measures to stabilize the situation and notified the public. Daishan's market resumed on July 15, and salt producers resumed salt production on July 18. By July 22, everything was back to normal. There was no mass exodus or starvation. Some fishermen and salt producers who participated in the killings and arson are afraid to return, but the salt affairs authorities cannot be held responsible for this. As for adjusting the police force, the order was issued beforehand and was unavoidable. After the incident on July 13, we telegraphed the headquarters, requesting that the Jian'an patrol ship and two companies from Cui's battalion of the Tax Police Regiment come to Daishan for reinforcement. Because the ship transportation took time, we transferred the Guerrilla Brigade stationed in Ningbo to Daishan as a temporary measure on July 17. On July 21, at the request of Commissioner Zhao, we withdrew the Guerrilla Brigade back to its original defense area, leaving only one company stationed in Daqu and Liangshan. Later, due to rumors among the fishermen and salt producers in Daishan about a second riot, we received an order from the sub-bureau to transfer the withdrawn two companies back to Daishan. In early August, the two companies of Cui's battalion arrived in Zhejiang, so we dispatched one company to be stationed in Daqu and Liangshan, and transferred the entire Guerrilla Brigade back to Ningbo. The current number of troops in Daishan is two-thirds less than before. The outside world's belief that we increased the number of troops is a misunderstanding. Regarding the arrest of criminals, apart from the arrest of Abbot Xinliang, who was involved in instigating the riot, which I discussed with Magistrate Shen, no one else has been arrested in Daishan. However, more than twenty fugitives were arrested in Xiangshan Port due to the discovery of stolen goods, weapons, and evidence of the riot during the investigation of illegal salt sales. All were handed over to the judicial authorities for impartial handling, which is different from indiscriminate arrest and implication.</p>
<p>The Current Key Objectives: Reorganizing Salt Administration</p>
<p>In summary, the matters concerning centralized salt storage and fishery salt coloring were originally ordered by the Ministry of Finance and are part of the salt administration, not the responsibility of the tax police. However, due to unforeseen changes, responsibilities are intertwined. Recently, I have read in the newspapers that criticism has been directed at the tax police. I do not wish to argue further. Fortunately, the tax police in Liangzhe are diligent in their duties, and tax revenue has now increased to more than two million. Local bandits have been suppressed in four provinces. The facts are clear. Some believe that we must sympathize with the suffering of the fishermen and salt producers, which is certainly a compassionate sentiment. However, the suffering stems from the fact that everything is not yet on the right track. Now, as we implement the salt law and reorganize salt administration, continuing to protect temporary and improper interests and disregarding national laws is not a fundamental solution. Furthermore, with the national crisis and dwindling financial resources, customs duties are currently affected by smuggling, and salt taxes in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Huai, and Fujian are the only reliable sources. According to population and tax rates, Liangzhe should collect 15 million yuan in salt tax each year, but in recent years, the revenue has not reached ten million, due to the loss of hundreds of thousands of yuan from fishery salt sales in the five prefectures of Suzhou. The total loss to the national treasury is significant, while the improper interests of the fishermen and salt producers are limited. There must be other ways in which they are being exploited. The national treasury suffers significant losses, but the poverty of the fishermen and salt producers remains unchanged. The reason for this deserves deep thought. If centralized salt storage and fishery salt coloring can be fully implemented, not only will the salt tax be thoroughly reorganized, but the fishermen and salt producers will also benefit greatly. It is beneficial for both the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Sun Kaigen Returns to Shanghai from Gansu, Discusses the Progress of the Tao Hui Canal Project</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports that the National Economic Commission, in order to revitalize water conservancy in Gansu Province, allocated 500,000 yuan for water conservancy projects in the province in the summer of 1934, to be constructed in phases. The Lintao Hui Canal was included in the first phase of water conservancy projects, with an allocation of 55,000 yuan. A canal design and survey team was dispatched to Gansu to work on the project. Sun Kaigen, a member of the team, returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency interviewed Sun Kaigen to discuss the progress of the project. His account is as follows:</p>
<p>Project Overview</p>
<p>According to Sun, the canal's water intake is located near the Da Hu Li family in the southern countryside of Lin County, diverting water from the Tao River, a tributary of the Yellow River. The main canal is 28 kilometers long, running from Baita in the south to Shengouyan in the north, irrigating approximately 36,000 mu of land in the north and south areas of Lintao. The canal line mostly runs along hillsides and foothills, requiring numerous flood discharge tunnels. The valleys and gullies crossed by the canal are all mountain watercourses, with widths reaching over 140 meters and depths reaching 15-16 meters. During the dry season, the flow in the gullies is minimal, sometimes even drying up completely. However, during sudden heavy rains in the summer, the flood flow can reach 600-700 cubic meters per second. The soil in the irrigation area consists of a loess layer at the top, a gravel layer in the middle, and a red soil layer at the bottom. For construction projects, stone is used below the flood level, and wood is used above the flood level, as local stone is scarce and expensive, while wood is abundant and inexpensive. The canal project includes a main canal, water intake, intake gate, spillway dam, reduction gate, tunnels, dredging channels, culverts, bridges, weirs, and branch gates.</p>
<p>Progress Overview</p>
<p>I was ordered to go to Gansu in September last year to assist in the supervision of the Tao Hui Canal project. I arrived at the Lintao construction site in October and immediately began to replace missing stakes, prepare for excavation, supervise the transportation of materials, and attempt to attract merchants to contract various construction projects. However, due to the tense situation of the bandit suppression campaign at that time, the requisition of laborers for repairing the airfield, building bunkers, and repairing the automobile road was affected to some extent. As of now, the first phase of earthwork has been completed. According to the first section of the main canal, due to the terrain, the canal body has been excavated to a depth of more than 10 meters, and the stone canal section at the canal mouth is expected to be quite labor-intensive. As for construction projects, materials are currently being transported, and contracts for the gully, Dongyu gully, and Yang gully aqueducts are being negotiated with outside contractors. It is currently planned that small projects will be constructed by local craftsmen, while larger projects will be contracted by outside contractors.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Donate Funds to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association Expands the National Aviation Salvation Movement; Shanghai Municipality Collects Funds to Purchase Aircraft to Present to the Government as a Birthday Commemoration for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The committee has been soliciting donations for several months, with excellent results. Donations from all sectors have been pouring in. Details of the solicitation have been published in various newspapers. According to inquiries, the following donations were received recently: Qiu Han-jun, 100 yuan; China Kiln Company, 20 yuan; Zhuan Zuo-heng, 100 yuan; Lu Gan-chen of the Youth Association, 355.4 yuan collected; Jiang Ting, 50 yuan; Wu Yun-chu, 100 yuan collected from the Tianyuan Factory and 10 yuan collected from the Tianli Factory; Shanghai City Bank, 111 yuan collected on behalf of the Huanqiu Iron Factory; Nan Jia Primary School, 8.54 yuan; and the Yuegong Dance Hall, which will donate all proceeds from three days of business for the birthday aircraft purchase, totaling 252.1 yuan. The Nightclub Dance Hall held its event last night, and the Penglai Grand Theater will donate all proceeds from its business on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company's New Ning Shipwrecked</h3>
<p>Hurricane Strikes, Passengers and Crew Safe</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's New Ning sustained the most damage of all commercial vessels struck by the hurricane in Hong Kong. The ship was departing from Guangdong with cargo and passengers for Hong Kong. It encountered the hurricane near Mount Ni-Te and attempted to reach Shachuan Bay for shelter, but it was too late. It dropped both anchors off Mount Ni-Te, but the wind was too strong, and the waves were too high. The ship was driven by the wind, and both anchors broke. The hull of the New Ning was struck by the hurricane and crashed into the foot of Mount Ni-Te, causing the hull to be breached by the rocks. Seawater flooded in. It did not strike a reef. Fortunately, the Hong Kong marine and land police dispatched barges at great risk to rescue all the passengers who had boarded the ship in Guangdong. The wind gradually shifted toward Guangxi Province around 5:00 PM on the 17th. Therefore, all the passengers were rescued. The crew was also safe. Taikoo Company's Hong Kong branch is assisting in the rescue efforts. However, the hull of the New Ning has been shattered and may sink at the location. It is uncertain whether the cargo can be salvaged. Efforts are underway to salvage the mail and other items. This ship was an excellent vessel in Taikoo's South China fleet, with a deadweight of 2,550 tons. Its hull was excellent, and it was a regular liner on the Shanghai-Shantou-Hong Kong route. The company will dispatch another ship to replace it.</p>
<p>The British Company's British India Mail ship Talma was also struck by the storm and drifted 12 nautical miles. Fortunately, it drifted into a harbor and did not sustain major damage. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haizhen was fortunate. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Guangdong stating that the Haizhen was safe and unharmed.</p>

It was also learned that Yuya Chaichi, the Japanese director of the Japan-China Trade Association, had come to Shanghai to inspect the association's affairs and has already returned to Japan after completing his work.</p>
<h3>Family Property Dispute Entangles Coffins Stored at Cemetery</h3>
<p>Siming Public Cemetery Groundlessly Accused</p>
<p>Shen Dong, the wife of the owner of Shen He-tai Fruit Shop at No. 296-298 Fada Road, is 76 years old and has three sons. The shop is managed jointly by the three sons. However, the eldest son, Shen Jin-you, and the second son, Shen Jin-cai, are illiterate and only handle external sales. The third son, Jin-fu, attended school and is responsible for the shop's accounts and finances. Unfortunately, Jin-fu fell ill and passed away in July of last year, leaving behind a young widow, Lin, and a biological daughter, Yin-zhu. The Shen family started in the fruit business in Shanghai and accumulated considerable wealth, which has not yet been divided. Jin-fu's widow, Shen Lin, unable to bear the bullying and abuse of her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law, took her daughter, Yin-zhu, and returned to her mother's home in Ningbo on May 1 of this year, seeking a new life. After Lin and her daughter left, Shen Dong and her sons Jin-you and Jin-cai hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, accusing Shen Lin of seizing their property. Shen Lin, acting as the legal guardian of her daughter, Yin-zhu, also hired lawyer Xu Wu-fang and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against her mother-in-law and brothers-in-law, seeking a division of the property. The parties have been suing each other, and the cases have not yet concluded. Recently, Shen Lin learned that her mother-in-law had reported the loss of the coffin storage ticket at Siming Public Cemetery, where her husband's coffin was stored, and prevented her from retrieving it. Shen Lin approached the cemetery to no avail and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against the manager of Siming Public Cemetery, seeking the return of the coffin containing the remains of Shen Jin-fu, coffin number 15766, which had been entrusted to the cemetery. The court accepted the case and held a hearing yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, presided over by Judge Wu Xiao-ke, summoning both parties for mediation. The plaintiff requested the court to order the return of the coffin. The defendant stated that because of the plaintiff's family dispute, the coffin storage ticket had been reported lost, and the cemetery could not release the coffin to either party. It was necessary to wait for the court to rule on which party was entitled to retrieve the coffin. The cemetery was not obstructing the process. After verifying the statements, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful and adjourned.</p>

<h3>Insurance Society Attention: Cultivating Insurance Talent</h3>
<p>The China Insurance Society, an organization initiated by domestic insurance experts and leaders in the insurance industry, has been established for a year. Its affairs have been quite developed. Recently, in view of the lack of domestic insurance talent, the Society has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Education and sent letters to Tsinghua University's China-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee, requesting that they consider allocating insurance study quotas when dispatching or sending students abroad, in order to cultivate national insurance talent.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Industry Consults: Opinions on Extra Tips</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association is soliciting opinions from its members regarding the New Life Movement's ban on extra tips. A notice was issued yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed members, regarding the New Life Movement's ban on extra tips, we have received a notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This association has sent representatives to attend discussions with relevant industry members and police authorities to discuss implementation measures. The first meeting was attended by Standing Committee Member Cheng Kefan at the Municipal Party Headquarters' New Life Movement meeting, requesting the New Life Movement to collect well-implemented measures from other provinces and cities for deliberation. On August 14th, Standing Committee Member Li Mancun from the Cantonese group and Standing Committee Member Hu Yuantang from the Anhui group attended the discussion, and the New Life Movement revised the draft measures. The principles in Article 3 of the implementation measures announced by the New Life Movement Headquarters seem to have discrepancies. On August 16th, the Standing Committee discussed and expressed support for banning extra tips. After examining Articles 4 and 5 of the implementation measures announced by the New Life Movement Headquarters, there seem to be doubts. Extortion should be sanctioned, but the point of whether lawful gratuities should be penalized needs to be studied. Furthermore, there is no consistency in the salaries of different industry groups, and the selection of personnel is determined by both labor and management. Extortion of extra tips from customers should be banned, and the fault lies with the individual, without implicating the member businesses. We have hypothetically made several points, as follows: (1) Upon implementation of the ban on extra tips, customers' voluntary and lawful gratuities should not be restricted. (2) If a waiter or employee is found to have extorted extra tips from customers, they will be penalized, without implicating the establishment. (3) The handling of gratuities should be determined by each business based on their existing good practices. Regarding the salaries of employees and workers, employers and employees should agree on their own. Extra demands from customers are absolutely prohibited, otherwise, they are solely responsible. (4) Regarding the implementation steps for the New Life Movement Promotion Headquarters' announced measures to ban extra tips, each industry must formulate its own detailed rules, as each industry has its own customs and different situations. However, our member businesses do not have the custom of security deposits, and should not be compared with other industries. Regarding the above four points, please participate with your opinions and submit further suggestions from the industry, combine them, handle them, and announce the implementation. Attached is a copy of the New Life Movement Headquarters' announced measures. Please submit them in writing within three days to the association for review."</p>

<h3>Eastern Yuhang Road: Counterfeit Currency Operation Busted, Printing Equipment Seized, Three Arrested and Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Huishan Patrol Room's Chinese Detective Zhou Guisen, Detectives Sun Aizhong, Li Peijin, Shen Binkui, and Wu Dekui, at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, busted a counterfeit Central Bank ten-yuan legal tender operation at 932 Heng'er Lane, Eastern Yuhang Road. Three suspects were arrested: Zhang Ruigen (the second landlord of the house), Cai Lianghuai, and He Chunjuan from Shaoxing. They confiscated two machines, eight copper plates, five plaster plates, five ink rollers, twenty-two picture plates, five steel-nib pens, four cans of ink, one bottle each of oil essence and hydrochloric acid, four cups of color, one sheet of multi-layered paper, several pounds of red powder, rosin powder, talcum powder, and white powder, seven packages of counterfeit currency white paper, one genuine Central Bank ten-yuan note numbered SX400503II, and one printed counterfeit note, along with fourteen unprinted notes. They were taken to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 195 of the Criminal Law regarding counterfeiting currency, stating that the principal offender, Zhang A'da, was still at large and requested an extension. According to the report from the Chinese and Western detectives, the case was solved after a tip-off to the patrol room from an informant, according to Lin Shiliang, the representative of the Central Bank. Upon questioning, Tong Ruigen confessed that Zhang A'da had rented the rear building from him for two weeks, denying being a shareholder in the operation. The others gave evasive answers. Cai Lianghuai confessed that on the 31st of last month, he was invited by his friend Zhang A'da to print the counterfeit notes, and was initially paid 20 yuan. Later, because the printing was not good, he invited He Chunjuan to print a genuine Central Bank ten-yuan note, which Zhang A'da brought as a sample to copy. After printing, it was handed over to Zhang Ruigen for safekeeping. He Chunjuan confessed that on the 2nd of this month, Cai Lianghuai introduced him to the operation, and he started working there on the 4th. He was only initially paid 5 yuan. Zhang A'da came every day to inspect the work and was out when the arrest was made. The others gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered them to be remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>House Collapses: Workers Injured</h3>
<p>Several newly built houses in Longmen Village, Shangwen Gate, Nanshi, were contracted for construction by the Daxing Construction Factory of Xiamen Road. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, while over ten laborers were driving piles, the adjacent dilapidated houses collapsed due to the vibrations, injuring eight pile-driving workers on the spot. They were Lu Shicheng, 35 years old, from Hunan, injured arm; Wang Minyi, 30 years old, from Hubei, injured right eye; Wang Zhenkun, 44 years old, from Wuxian, injured left arm; Li Zhengpin, 27 years old, injured thigh; Xu Zhongnian, 36 years old, local, injured back and waist; Qiu Mingxing, 28 years old, from Hunan, injured both legs; Yuan Dayang, 31 years old, injured right leg; Zhou Jinfen, 26 years old, injured left leg. The injured laborers fell to the ground, groaning incessantly. They were later sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by the foreman.</p>
<h3>Pauper's Asylum: Live Chickens Stolen, Over 400 Stolen, Losses Over 300 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the pauper's asylum at the intersection of Liuying Road and Song Park Road, Zhabei, Shao Xin'da, who is over 60 years old and from Kunshan, stayed at the asylum because he had no relatives. He and Wang Bingnian jointly raised hundreds of chickens to make a living. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, seven or eight robbers, four of whom were armed with pistols, warned them not to make a sound. They first searched Shao and the others but found nothing of value. Then, they stole over 400 of the largest chickens. According to Shao and the others, the losses were estimated at over 300 yuan. These chickens had just grown up, and half a year of hard work had been lost.</p>
<h3>Fish Market: Buying and Selling Salted Goods</h3>
<p>Two Fish Firms Request Concessions: Board of Directors to Discuss</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry began selling salted and dried fish goods on August 1st, business has been good. However, the Yan Kang and Gong Shun fish firms, which specialize in salted fish transactions, have not yet moved into the market. Previously, Director Tang Chengzong and others were sent to persuade them, and they have gradually become more amenable. However, the two fish firms have requested to join as brokers and also suggest that the business method be changed, with salted fish sales taking place at the original location in the Sixteenth Settlement, and the fish market sending someone to copy the accounts and collect commissions. The reason given is that the fish market is relatively small, and there is no fixed time for salted fish transactions, as they occur throughout the day, so it is more convenient at the original location. It is reported that the fish market will hold a board of directors meeting within days to discuss this matter. It seems that the request to add one seat for brokers may be accepted, but the request to change the business method will not be considered because it violates the business regulations.</p>
<h3>Chen Case Support Association and Family Petition the City Government: Received by Section Chief Yu, Further Negotiations to Follow, Support Association Plans to Hire High-Level Advisors</h3>
<p>The Chen Huizhang case support association for the American sailor's brutal murder of Chen Huizhang, yesterday sent representatives, along with the victim's family, to petition the city government. They were received by Section Chief Yu, and further serious negotiations were held. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Situation: Because the victim's family, birth father Chen Xizhu and wife Chen Zangshi, repeatedly requested that justice be sought for Chen Huizhang, the support association sent representatives Bao Zhenhuang, Xu Yitong, Tang Mengru, Chen Zhongjue, Liu Xin, Wei Yunqing, and six others to the city center to petition the city government at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, along with the victim's family. Since Mayor Wu was away on official business, Section Chief Yu Hede of the city government received them. In addition to submitting a written petition (details of the petition below), the association representatives described the circumstances of the Chen case in detail and requested that the city government promptly lodge a serious protest with the British Consulate to achieve the goal of punishing the murderer. Section Chief Yu expressed acceptance and replied that the city government had already lodged a protest with the British Consulate and would take further action after receiving a reply. Then, the victim's family, Chen Xizhu and Chen Zangshi, knelt down and begged for justice, their voices filled with tears, which was heart-wrenching. Section Chief Yu earnestly comforted them. The representatives were satisfied and returned. It is also learned that the association will soon hire Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaojie, Du Yuesheng, Huang Yirong, Xue Dubi, Zhang Shizhao, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Zuomin, Jiang Yiping, Cheng Jingliu, Tian Shuquan, Zhu Shaowen, Yu Zhaolin, and other prominent figures as high-level advisors.</p>
<p>Petition to the City Government: The association submitted a written document to the city government yesterday, stating, "Requesting that the case be filed and requesting a prompt approval and delivery to ensure credibility and facilitate progress. Our association, the Chen Huizhang case support association for the brutal murder of Chen Huizhang by British sailors, was convened and organized by Zhang Shiying and others from the Jianghuai Fellow Association on July 16th. We have already reported to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and requested your government to lodge a protest with the British Consulate. Now, because this matter concerns international and national issues, our association needs to expand its organization. On the 10th of this month, we convened an enlarged meeting at No. 692, 3rd Floor, Nos. 33-34 Niuzhuang Road. Wei Weiqing and others, as well as representatives from various parks, numbering over 40 people, attended. Wei Weiqing presided over the meeting and elected Ji Longtu and 18 others as executive committee members, Tao Han and 12 others as supervisory committee members, and elected eight alternate executive and supervisory committee members. At the same time, the executive and supervisory committee meeting was held, and standing committee members were elected. To improve work efficiency, responsible persons for each group were selected and temporarily located at Nos. 33-34, 1st Floor, No. 692 Niuzhuang Road as the association's address, and a rectangular seal was engraved, with the words 'Chen Huizhang Case Support Association Seal for Brutal Murder by British Sailors'. It will be used from today. After the Chen case is concluded, we will promptly request its removal at any time. Apart from submitting to each party, we are filing a document together with the list of executive and supervisory committee members and responsible persons of each group and submit to Your Honor for approval. Please approve the filing and deliver it to ensure credibility and facilitate progress. Furthermore, at the general meeting held by our association on August 1st to entertain people from all walks of life, a representative of the rickshaw pullers, Cang Gongwen and others, submitted an original request to our association to uphold justice and fight for reason. The details are as follows (the original request can be found in the newspapers on the 3rd of this month). Furthermore, according to the victim's family, they were previously coerced by Xu and others from the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association, induced by benefits, falsely claiming that they would take them to a certain foreign charitable organization to receive aid to support widows and orphans, etc. Wan Zei and others were bribed by the head of the association, Mai Xi, and attempted to benefit the criminals and avoid punishment. Xu and others dared to be unconscionable and acted as accomplices, treating the lives of compatriots like grass and ignoring the international status. Apart from the family filing a complaint with the court to severely punish them according to the law and submitting a detailed report to Your Honor for review, we combine them to submit and clarify the matter. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government, attached with a paper containing the list of staff members of the Chen Huizhang Case Support Association for Brutal Murder by British Sailors."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces: Successful Bidders for Central Wharf Lighterage</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company solicited bids for the lighterage of the Central Wharf. The bidding was opened on the 15th of this month. It is reported that the company reviewed the bids and, in addition to the principle of the lowest bid price, also paid close attention to the bidders' experience. Therefore, the result of the review was that the bid price for the first bid was 73%, and the bid price for the second bid was 74%. The difference between the two bids was only 1%, but because the bidder for the second bid, Zhang Xiaobao, had experience in contracting for lighterage and had more experience, Zhang Xiaobao was selected as the successful bidder, and Huang Bingming was the alternate successful bidder. The other bids were deemed to have excessively high bid prices and were not qualified. It is also reported that this Thursday (i.e., the 20th) is the bidding date for the South Wharf (i.e., Jin Liyuan). It is understood that the South Wharf is the company's own wharf. According to the person in charge of the company, the payment of the lighterage fee for the wharf will be prioritized when the company receives the customer's payment, to assist the contractor in turnover and achieve the purpose of mutual assistance.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Sends Letter to Public Security Bureau: Requesting Punishment of Bad Police</h3>
<p>Harassing Women and Beating Them Up: Neighbors Witnessed Their Atrocities</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai sent a letter to Cai Jingjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday, requesting punishment for police officers of the Public Security Bureau who harassed women and arbitrarily beat, insulted, and detained them. The original text reads: "To the esteemed Director, according to a joint letter from our fellow villagers Wai Xian Gua Street's Yingyuhao, Zhongxingji, Zhao Longmao Xiehe Coal, Youyizhai, Wantong, Jiang Yongsheng, Shi Longxing, Xianghe, Qingxiang, Tongxing, Yunyu Shufang, Yongtaichang, and Wang Ying, fellow villager Yan, wife, resides upstairs in the cake shop at Xingren Jiekou, Wai Xian Gua Street. Originally from Zhenhai, her husband died of illness last year, leaving behind two young sons. She usually relies on washing clothes for a living. She is in a difficult situation and has maintained her integrity. At midnight on the 10th of this month, she was enjoying the cool air. Her young son was hungry, and she wanted to go out to buy something. Unexpectedly, a policeman came face to face, and seeing that the woman was somewhat attractive, he intended to harass her. He first patted the woman's chest and pointed out that she was a 'floating white', and the woman was subjected to such unsavory words and reasoned with him. Who knew that the police officer would become angry out of shame and anger? Yan ran away, and the police officer, under the pretext of investigating household registration, broke into the residence. After she refused, the police officer went out, took off his uniform, and came back to drag her out. Two more police officers came in the middle of the way and carried out the beating. Passers-by felt indignant and urged them to go to the bureau for justice. When they reached Xintai Lane near the Dawang Temple, Wai Xian Gua Street, which was a deserted area, the police officer dared to beat her with a leather belt, and another police officer beat her severely with his fist, almost breaking her. The woman was seriously injured. At that time, the woman fell to the ground in pain and was dragged to the First District Office in Maojia Lane. The interrogation was conducted by the office itself, and private torture was carried out. In the early morning, the woman was dragged out of the bureau gate. The woman could only hire a car home because she could not make herself heard. Since this case occurred, residents in the Xian Gua Street area have been uneasy. They all said that under the broad daylight, there are such illegal public officials, which is deeply hated. We earnestly request you to send someone to conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible, and fight for justice according to reason, and give voice to the grievances of our weak female villagers, in order to punish the police officer, and to ensure peace of mind, and look forward to your reply," etc. After our association sent Shao Xiangqing to investigate the scene of the incident and the victim, one question was asked to the neighbors, who accused the police officers of relying on their power to bully the weak, and the victim was also seriously injured, claiming the same as before, and learned that the shoulder badge of one of the police officers who committed the crime was No. 4406 (the name of the police officer who committed the crime is Shang Zhenhua). In addition to the victim filing a lawsuit according to law, we hereby send a letter to your bureau director for review and promptly send the three police officers who abused the people to the court for punishment, and please order and warn your subordinates not to have such illegal acts in the future. I am deeply grateful and look forward to your reply.</p>
<h3>Xue Jiasheng Kidnapping Case: Chauffeur Arrested, Rescheduled to the 30th for Combined Trial, One Account Says Wu Was Xue's Chauffeur</h3>
<p>The case of kidnapping Xue Jiasheng, the third son of the late paint merchant Xue Baorun, was solved by the French Concession Police Department on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. Chen Jintang, Bu Mingqing, Sun Yanan, Pu Yaozhang, Zhang Ruifa, and Chen Dongsheng, the owner of the Youning Car Company, and six others were arrested inside No. 72 Julai Road. The hostage was safely rescued inside the institution at No. 222 Bushi Road. Two Mauser pistols and Browning pistols were seized successively in the two institutions, as well as opium smoking equipment for the hostage to smoke. They were escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention for investigation, which was rescheduled to the 30th for further interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the detectives handling the case have learned that the chauffeur of the car driven by the kidnappers when Xue Jiasheng was kidnapped was Wu Genyou from Ningbo (39 years old, residing at No. 83 Maiqi Lane, Maiqi Road), who was hiding at No. 86, Alley 1812, Lafayette Road. At 11:30 AM on the 17th, his friend, surnamed Xu, was arrested at the address and taken back to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court and interrogated by Judge Chen Shuoying. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the Police Department, explained the case and requested that the case be rescheduled to August 30 and incorporated into the case of kidnapper Chen Jintang and others for investigation and prosecution. The court verified the report, briefly questioned Wu about his age and origin, and instructed the defendant to be remanded in custody. The rescheduling to August 30 for a combined trial with Chen Jintang and others was approved. It is said that Wu was the chauffeur hired by the hostage, and Chen Huanzhang, the young owner of the Youning Car Company, borrowed the car from his owner to help kidnap his master. Is the evidence credible?</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Requests Correction: Detectives Deceiving Hawkers</h3>
<p>Advocating to the Public Works Department on Their Behalf</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Ningbo Fellow Association requested the Public Works Department Police Department to correct the detectives of the Public Works Department who arbitrarily drove away hawkers and forced them to suspend business. The original text reads: "To the esteemed Director, according to Yu Meilin, a fellow villager who is a representative of the hawkers in the old street of Jing'an Temple Road, it has been claimed that the stalls selling vegetables, fish, and meat in the old street of Jing'an Temple Road have been set up for more than ten years to supply residents with purchases, and the hawkers have been able to earn a living in peace. On the 13th of this month, the Waterworks Company sent workers to repair the water pipes next to Dongyu Road, and there was a dispute between two stalls selling fruits and vegetables and the workers of the Waterworks Company due to a misunderstanding. Suddenly, Chinese and Western police officers arrived, and without asking questions, they drove away all the hawkers in the old street. If they were a little slow, they would arbitrarily throw the fish, meat, fruits, and vegetables in the stalls. Among them, hawker Wang Enlong suffered losses and affected his livelihood. He explained to the Western police officer and asked him not to throw them away in order to protect the hawkers' blood and sweat, and asked that he be allowed to set up stalls in places farther away from the repair of the water pipes and in areas where the repair work was not affected, so as to make a living. The Western police officer left angrily, and after a while, more than ten detectives came and pointed to Wang Enlong. The hawkers were indignant when they heard the news, because Enlong's request was not illegal, and the hawkers paid for licenses to operate. How could they be arbitrarily destroyed? Now Wang Enlong is suffering because he stood up for justice, and the hawkers are willing to go to the police station for interrogation. The police chief saw that it was difficult to violate the public's anger and did not make an arrest, but did not allow the hawkers to operate. Later, the shops and residents in the area jointly petitioned to restore normal operations, but Wang Enlong was not allowed to set up a stall and detectives were sent to summon him, causing Wang Enlong to be unable to live and work in peace. It is now learned that what Wang Enlong requested from the Western police chief that day was said to be obstructing official business, which is truly what is called wanting to add a crime, there is no shortage of excuses. Meilin could not bear to see his fellow villagers suffer innocently and asked for redress. The deception of civilians by the rental world police personnel has been heard repeatedly, especially the peddlers. If they justify themselves a little, they will be accused of obstructing official business and arrested. The section mentioned by the fellow villager is just one of those who have been bullied. Our association does not understand why the police personnel do not allow civilians to speak. According to the aforementioned situation, we hereby send a special letter to the General Inspector, asking you to investigate and correct the situation as soon as possible, and still allow the hawker Wang Enlong to operate as usual. I am deeply grateful and look forward to your reply.</p>
<h3>National Goods Maintenance Association Investigates: Actual Situation of National Oil Testing</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association telegraphed Lu, Director of the Construction Department of Sichuan Province, yesterday, saying, "Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Chongqing Jian: According to Comrade Yu Shunxiang's claim to the association, when he was investigating national coal in various provinces, he discovered salt and waste oil in Sichuan Province. According to the chemical test results, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil were refined (currently stored in the Sichuan Construction Department), all of which are essential raw materials for today's industry, and are particularly important for national defense. We intend to promote them so that we can raise funds to start operations. Now, at the 25th session of the 15th Executive Committee meeting of the association, it was decided to telegraph Director Lu of the Sichuan Construction Department to inform him of the process of Yu Shunqing's discovery of domestic oil, and to send the four types of oil that have been tested so that we can take steps to promote them according to the record. We check and promote domestic goods, which is the duty of the association, and it is also your long-cherished wish. Therefore, we follow the advice and telegraph to ask your honor to review and reply to us in order to benefit the public. Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, bowed to the bar."</p>

<p>In order to develop transportation and reduce the burden on the people, the Ministry of Communications has specially reduced the provincial thunder fee and intra-city report fee. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has recently received a formal order from the Ministry of Communications, which will be implemented on the first of next month. The Huadong News Agency reporter specially investigated and recorded the following yesterday morning:</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications' domestic telegraph prices, business telegraphs, Chinese clear code 10 cents, secret code 20 cents, foreign clear code 20 cents, secret code 40 cents, regardless of provincial boundaries. Now, in order to develop transportation, the provincial telegraph fee will be charged at a 30% discount on the original price, clear code Chinese 7 cents, secret code 14 cents, and so on.</p>
<p>Name and Address: Charging Method</p>
<p>The original name and address of the recipient, if it is within 15 characters, is charged according to 5 characters. Now it has been changed to calculate one character for every two characters, but it is only limited to this province.</p>
<p>Intra-City Telegrams: 50% Discount</p>
<p>As for intra-city telegrams (that is, sending from this city to this city), the original price was 5 cents per character, but now it has been reduced to 2.5 cents per character. In addition, the original price of Muben Province news telegrams was 2.5 cents per character, but now it has been reduced to 2 cents, all of which are scheduled to be implemented at the same time.</p>
<h3>Special Zone Fresh Meat Industry: Requesting Prohibition of Using Old Scales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Works Department Was Petitioned: Because the Public Concession fresh meat industry is used by various restaurants and ordinary citizens using old scales, failing to comply with the weights and measures instruments stipulated by the government, the industry has suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the industry specially sent representatives Sun Hongyang, Wang Qixun, Yang Hengbo, Fan Deyu, and Wang Liangbao to the Public Works Department Health Department to petition at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Wei Yi, the section chief of the Food and Beverage Inspection Section, received them and immediately made three requests: (1) Please the Public Works Department to send police to prohibit those who use balance scales, (2) Please the police to ban the use of balance scales by various restaurants, and (3) Please send detectives to assist in investigating and confiscating the balance scales privately stored in various restaurants. The Health Department accepted it and immediately informed the Police Department to send police to cooperate with the Health Department to strictly investigate and ban it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Tobacco Exchange Industry: Representative Meeting Held Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Municipal Tobacco Exchange Industry Guild held a representative meeting yesterday afternoon.  Eight committee members including Chen Kunxian and Qian Xuanqing, and over sixty member representatives including Yang Keqin and Yu Chengchu, attended. Chen Kunxian chaired the meeting, and Zhang Songji recorded the proceedings. The following proposals were discussed: (A)  Recently, the market has been sluggish, deeply impacting business.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain operations. Regarding the tobacco and alcohol license tax, should we send representatives to the tax authorities to request a reduction in the tax burden as a gesture of consideration?  Decision: Approved. (B) Unfair competition and price-cutting within the industry are disrupting the guild's charter and regulations, hindering the overall business.  Should the guild impose sanctions and penalties? Decision:  Council member Chen was publicly nominated to conduct a preliminary investigation and persuade fellow businesses to comply. Otherwise, draft sanctioning and penalty rules will be submitted to the relevant government authorities for execution. (C) Since the currency reform, the exchange business has declined dramatically. Should the authorities be urged to provide assistance and relief quickly?  Decision: Approved. (D)  The "Gu Ben" soap produced by Da Cheng Company has been offering price reductions and gifts since the first of this month, giving away five boxes for every hundred boxes purchased. This promotion was announced on the 15th, and gifts were distributed to wholesale outlets and stores. However, the benefits have not been universally applied. Decision: Send letters to Da Cheng Company and other tobacco companies offering gifts, including Fuxin, Changfeng, Hexing, Ruilun, and Jiangzhe, requesting that they provide the same benefits. Also, notify all members to report their actual inventory to the office within three days for registration, which will be used to create a list to be submitted to the companies for verification and supplementary compensation, to ensure fairness and demonstrate consideration.</p>
<h3>Yinhsiang District: Establishment of the Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Within the Yinhsiang District of this city, there was originally no self-defense organization.  Due to frequent robberies and unrest in the area, in May of this year, more than ten people, including Lu Jingtan, Xu Yaonan, and Yang Xinshi, initiated the formal establishment of an independent squadron of the Yinhsiang District Self-Defense Corps.  Approval was obtained from the Municipal Self-Defense Committee to set up a preparatory office inside Yinbei Elementary School in Yangjiabang Town.  They began recruiting and actively training corps members.  The Municipal Self-Defense Committee appointed Wu Chuiying, Sun Xia, and Lu Jingtan as supervisors of the Yinhsiang District Self-Defense Corps Independent Squadron, and Xu Yaonan and Yang Xinshi as commander and deputy commander, respectively.</p>
<h3>Death of Hu Meian's Mother</h3>
<p>Madam Han, the mother of Mr. Hu Meian, Deputy Director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, passed away at 2:50 PM yesterday at her residence on Route Ratard, at the age of 82.

<h3>Nantong Natives in Shanghai Host Banquet for Ma Junshuo Last Night</h3>
<p>Lawyer and Doctor Junshuo was appointed by the Judicial Yuan in January last year to visit countries in Europe, America, and Japan to investigate judicial matters. He visited Japan, the United States, England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Brazil, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries and was welcomed by the judicial circles of various countries. He also attended meetings of commercial courts throughout France. He actively promoted the progress of judicial matters in our country, hoping to recover consular jurisdiction in the future. During his visit, he also wrote a comparative legal paper, which was praised by jurists in Europe and America. Since Mr. Ma returned to China at the end of last month, he has been busy compiling reports and submitting them to the Judicial Yuan for joint review by the judicial community. Therefore, he rarely attended social events. Recently, Ge Futian, Shen Tinggui, and other Nantong natives in Shanghai hosted a public banquet for Mr. Ma at 7:00 PM last night at the Zhimeilou Restaurant on the Fourth Malu Road, because of the hard work Mr. Ma put in during this overseas visit.  It had also been a long time since they had seen each other. Zhang Zhenxi, Yang Guanbei, Xu Yihe, and Sun Shaoqing were invited to accompany them. During the dinner, Mr. Ma reported on the situation in various European and American countries. The guests and host enjoyed themselves, and the party ended around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Electrical Industry Guild Asks Why Specific Foreign Goods Are Designated</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai National Products Promotion Federation received a letter from the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Guild regarding the Audit Department and the Railway Corps Police Headquarters specifying the use of foreign electrical appliances, and requested a letter of inquiry. The original letter is as follows: "Promoting national products is one of the seven major movements. The National Economic Construction Movement Committee has also included promoting national products in its work outline. On May 22nd of this year, the Executive Yuan specially approved our guild's request and instructed all government agencies across the country that electrical appliances that are already available from domestic manufacturers should not be purchased from foreign manufacturers. It is the duty of outstanding nations in the world for their citizens to use domestic goods, and it is also the only way to maintain the domestic economy. However, recently, colleagues in the capital have reported that the Audit Department has specified the use of certain foreign-brand light bulbs, and the Railway Corps Police Headquarters has specified the use of certain foreign-brand electric fans. Upon investigation, there are excellent domestic light bulbs and electric fans available. If the rumors are true, these departments and bureaus, occupying a leading position in government agencies, are not only failing to promote national products but are actually engaging in exclusionary behavior, which is truly shocking. If the agencies located in the capital cannot follow the rules, it is even more difficult to expect those in remote areas to comply. Wouldn't this undermine the credibility of the government and invite contempt from foreigners? Therefore, this letter is to request your federation to send letters to the above-mentioned two agencies to inquire about the truth and to seek a response."</p>
<h3>Numerous Idle Vehicles: Rickshaw Industry in Decline</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Council Vehicle Committee, the rickshaw industry in this city has been repeatedly suppressed, and business has plummeted. After the Vehicle Committee restricted the number of rickshaw pullers who could register, there are now more rickshaws than pullers. On the one hand, unregistered pullers have no rickshaws to pull; on the other hand, registered pullers have left Shanghai or returned to their hometowns to farm, resulting in many idle rickshaws. The situation has become more serious since the beginning of summer. Currently, the average number of rickshaws operating each day is less than half. Even the mutual aid fee, which should be paid by the pullers, has become an additional burden due to idle rickshaws. Rickshaw owners are losing a significant amount of money every day. Most smaller operations are unable to sustain themselves. Every time taxes are due, they borrow from all sides and pawn everything they own. If this continues, the future of the rickshaw industry is unimaginable. At the same time, the Vehicle Committee has recently been rigorously inspecting and punishing rickshaws. Rickshaws are often ordered to suspend operations for a month or half a month, and rickshaw owners can only bear the pain and accept it. It is also reported that recently, more than a thousand unregistered unemployed pullers have been arrested and fined by the police in the past half-month. These pullers are experiencing extreme hardship due to unemployment. Once arrested and fined, their cries of sorrow are truly heartbreaking. In this city, 300,000 people depend on rickshaws for their livelihood. This situation has serious implications for the future of society.</p>

It is expected that many people will attend, creating a scene of great mourning and honor.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Incident: Borrowing Usurious Loans to Sell Ginkgo for a Living, Thugs Demand Protection Money and Push a Child to Death</h3>
<p>Xu Ada, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 7, Lane 349, Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, was destitute. He borrowed five yuan at usurious interest to buy ginkgo nuts to sell hot ginkgo, hoping to earn a meager profit to support his wife and children. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, at 8:00 PM, he went out with his burden. A local thug named Xiao Sanzi demanded protection money from him. Xu pleaded bitterly, saying that the capital was borrowed at usurious interest, and begged for exemption. Xiao Sanzi then snatched Xu Ada's ginkgo bag. Xu's eleven-year-old son, Ji Fa, who was nearby, saw someone bullying his father and stepped forward to grab it back. Xiao Sanzi pushed him forcefully, causing him to fall to the ground and suffer serious injuries. Xu immediately ordered his wife, Xu Chen, to take him home. His son's face was pale, and his breath was faint. They rushed him to the New General Charity Hall, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 3:00 PM the next afternoon. They immediately reported the incident to the police station in charge, and Xiao Sanzi was arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Yesterday, they ordered the local security officer, Police Officer Yang, to report to the local court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Two Robbers Apprehended in Lujiazui, Pudong</h3>
<p>One Handgun Confiscated</p>
<p>In the areas of Yangjiazhai and Haixing Road in Lujiazui, Pudong, five or six robbery cases have occurred in the past few months. The perpetrators have not yet been apprehended. Zhang Haigen, the leader of the second team of the Yangjing District Self-Defense Corps, was instructing his subordinates to rigorously pursue the matter. On the evening before last, at around 6:00 PM, he received a tip that a group of bandits was meeting in the Sanwanchang area. He immediately dispatched squad leader Zhu Paixiang and section chief Yang Zhongfu to lead officers to investigate. Two robbers, Zhen Mei from Ningbo and Xu A'gen from Haizhou, were arrested on the spot. A fake handgun was found on Xu. The witnesses were taken into custody. After questioning by Zhang, the two confessed that the ringleader was named Wang Axiang, a Ningbo native. They and Wang Axiang, along with the fugitives A'miao, A'fa, and Sanmei, committed several robberies in Pudong. The first time was on April 1st of this year, when they robbed Lu A'da's house in Chunhui Lane, Tieban Bridge, and stole over 90 yuan. The second time was on April 13th, when they robbed the Dafeng Cigarette and Paper Store on Lujiazui Road and stole over 90 yuan. The third time was on May 10th, when they robbed Chen Guihua's house at No. 55, Haixing Road, and stole over 70 yuan. The fourth time was on the 24th of last month, when they robbed the Yin family's house at No. 9, Peideli, Land Temple Road, Yangjiazhai, and stole an amount they had forgotten. Tonight, Wang Axiang called the two of them to meet in front of the Wanguo Cinema in Hongkou to rob a cigarette and paper store next to a laundry shop on Gongping Road, but they were caught instead. They also said that Wang Axiang lived next to the Yangjia Bridge in Yangjiazhai. The squad leader then ordered Zhu Paixiang and others to continue to capture Wang Axiang. One bullet and several pawn tickets were found on Wang. Wang confessed that he had been sentenced to five years in prison for committing a crime in the Public Concession. In addition to the fake handgun, he also had a real handgun, which he borrowed from Laipi and which was later borrowed by A'mao Baobao, who committed a crime in the French Concession and was imprisoned. The squad leader verified the confession and summoned the victims to identify the three men without error. He ordered that the three men, the fake handgun, and the bullet be sent to the Pudong branch office for interrogation yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Suicide Pact in Wu Gong Hotel</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM, the tea server at room 429 of the Wu Gong Hotel at No. 151 Fujian Road discovered that a guest named Wang Tiansheng, an Anhui native, 27 years old, and a woman had taken poison. They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but the treatment was ineffective, and they both died. This has already been reported. Upon investigation by the Laozha Public Security Bureau, only a suicide note was found, addressed to the hotel. It stated that they had been staying at the hotel for four days, had not missed any room fees, and that they were a married couple who had been running a store in Hangzhou. Business had been poor recently, and they were experiencing extreme financial difficulties, making life unbearable, so they resorted to this. An empty opium box and two bodies were found. The police transported them to the Filial Piety Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday, Prosecutor Tang was dispatched by the First Special Court to examine the bodies and confirm that the bodies were indeed the deceased Wang Tiansheng, male, and a female surnamed Wang.  They had died from opium poisoning.  There were no family members of the deceased, so the bodies were handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection.</p>

<p>Zhang Junhong, a Sanbei native, 42 years old, residing at No. 79, Tongle Lane, Huasheng Road, Pudong, had a pregnant wife, Ms. Mu, who was suffering from diarrhea. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, the couple was riding in a rickshaw pulled by Wang Fuchang, intending to seek treatment from a doctor on Nanjing Road and Shilu Road. As they were traveling east on Dongxi Huade Road near Huaji Road, a cargo truck No. 16611 suddenly sped up from behind. The truck driver attempted to overtake Zhang's rickshaw, and the rear wheels hit the rickshaw, causing it to overturn. Zhang Junhong suffered severe head injuries, while Zhang's wife and rickshaw puller Wang Fuchang suffered minor injuries to their hands and feet.

The Huishan Police Station conducted an investigation and transported the body to the Filial Piety Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang was dispatched by the First Special District Court to examine the body. The police reported the previous situation and stated that they had ordered the truck driver to be present this morning for questioning, but he had not arrived.

<h3>Hua Dafan and Gu Xuelin's Marriage Dispute in Court</h3>
<p>Hua Dafan (also known as Da Wei), the owner of the Yuchengfeng Fruit Factory on Yongji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, was previously sued by Gu Xuelin, a 33-year-old woman from Suzhou, in the First Special District Court for seduction and abandonment. The grounds for the lawsuit stated that Gu was originally married to a man named Chen and lived in Suzhou. In August of the previous year, she met Hua Dafan through an introduction at a dinner party. She was seduced into an affair and divorced her husband. She then began living with Hua. On January 18th of the previous year, a contract was signed at the law office of Zhang Shijie, stating that the wedding would be held within one year, or Hua would have to pay 50,000 yuan in damages.

<h3>Shanghai's Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit</p>
<p>(A General Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, Part 34)</p>
<p>(3) Business Methods of Film Companies</p>
<p>(2) The United China Film Company - This company was formed by the merger of companies such as Grand China, Lily, Minxin, and Shanghai. It initially had a capital of 400,000 yuan, with Sir Robert Ho Tung and Lo Weng-kan as directors, and Lo Ming-yau as general manager. It was officially established in October 1930. In the past, it adopted a branch factory system, with a total of seven factories set up one after another. Factories 1, 2, 4, and 6 were located in Shanghai, Factory 3 was located in Hong Kong, Factory 5 was located in Beiping, and Factory 7 was located in Sichuan. Later, Factory 4 was destroyed in the Songhu Battle, Factory 5 was closed due to the September 18th Incident, and Factory 7 was closed due to the Sichuan Rebellion. As a result, on the one hand, the capital was increased to 1 million yuan, and on the other hand, the factory system was changed to a unit system based on standards. Shanghai Factories 1, 2, 6, and 3 were changed to factories 1, 2, and 3, and Hong Kong Factory 3 was changed to the Hong Kong Film Studio. The Shanghai Company, originally Factory 4, separated from Lianhua and was independently reorganized into the Shanghai Sound Film Company. After Luo returned from studying in the United States, the company was reorganized into a collective factory system. On January 1, 1935, a centralized plan was announced, and on April 1, all factories in Shanghai were concentrated in Xujiahui. The original site of Factory 1 was expanded, and the internal organization was rectified. The company's products were of excellent subject matter, able to cater to the psychology of the general youth, but due to insufficient working capital, production was slow. There are currently more than 200 employees and actors, with monthly expenses of about 15,000 yuan. A list of the company's output over the years is listed below:</p>
<p>The company's previous films, except for "Wild Grass and Flowers" and "Milky Way Double Stars," were dubbed by Yi Moling. Now that it has purchased sound recording equipment, it has already made two sound films, "Waves Wash the Sand" and "Song of a Loving Mother."</p>
<p>(3) Tianyi Film Company - This company is jointly operated by the Shao Zuiweng brothers. It was initially a partnership, but now it has been reorganized into a company. It was established in 1920 in the Republic era. It has a branch office in Nanyang, managing the company's and other companies' products. The company's address is located at 232 Ganshidong Road. Its output is quite rapid. In 1931, it purchased Movietone sound recording equipment and produced sound films. In addition to producing its own films, it also shoots films for small companies, such as the Ancient Company's "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and the Southern Company's "Platinum Dragon." In the past few years, it has produced more than 80 silent films and more than 30 sound films, making it the company with the most output in Shanghai. The company has a branch factory in Hong Kong. Since last year, due to the difficulty of establishing a foothold in Shanghai, it has focused its efforts on developing the Hong Kong factory, producing Cantonese sound films that cater to the psychology of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. The scope of the Shanghai general factory has been reduced compared to before. Recently, the New Era Company was closed down, and all the actors who played "Mr. Wang" have rejoined Tianyi. It is rumored that they are currently engaged in the production of a sequel to "Mr. Wang." The company currently has more than 100 employees, with monthly expenses of about 10,000 yuan.

<h3>Interview with Housewives</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The family is centered on the housewife, and the biggest customers of national goods are families, and the power to purchase them lies in the hands of the housewife. If housewives love to use national goods, the promotion of national goods will be as smooth as fire starting to burn or water flowing downhill. Therefore, promoting and advocating national goods should start with the family. It is absolutely necessary to start from the housewife's perspective.</p>
<p>We have interviewed housewives from middle-class and upper-class families to inquire about their opinions on using national goods. Most of them are happy to purchase national goods, believing that Chinese people should use Chinese goods, which is a matter of course and without hesitation. However, after using them, they often feel that national goods still have the following shortcomings, and they hope to find ways to improve them: (1) The products lack standardization. Often, the same item has one form the last time, and the next time it has already changed its appearance, and even the color, texture, and effectiveness vary from time to time. (2) The decoration is still not elaborate enough. The packaging and boxing lack research. (3) The value has not been able to strive for low prices, mostly because the cost is not easy to reduce at one time. (4) Often, when users need a certain product, it cannot be supplied, and other types or secondary brands are used to muddle through. (5) They only like to imitate others and fail to preserve the inherent beauty of China. This is in regard to the factory side. There are also opinions on national goods stores or companies: (1) The clerks lack a spirit of service. Purchasing goods often takes a long time, which is annoying. (2) National goods are not fully stocked, and prices are inconsistent. (3) They fail to guide customers in detail, explaining the nature and effectiveness of certain goods and comparing them with foreign goods. These are the unsatisfactory points in using national goods, which were said by more than one hundred housewives and can be used as a reference for manufacturers and sellers. Now the Shanghai National Goods Movement United Association has sent people to interview housewives to persuade them to use national goods. This kind of very meaningful and valuable work is indeed a fundamental strategy for promoting national goods. I sincerely hope that it will be realized as soon as possible. Therefore, I state what I have seen in order to promote its success.</p>
<h3>A Few Words on National Cigarette Paper</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>What is most regrettable about the current national goods business is that although the products of factories are purely national goods, the raw materials are not national goods, or the raw materials contain imported goods. In this regard, the authorities in charge of national goods factories should earnestly take responsibility, think deeply and anxiously about replacing them with national goods, and resolutely reform. In case there are no national goods to replace them, they should study and contribute to the reproduction of them by Chinese people. Now, the Jiaxing Minfeng Paper Mill can utilize this point to manufacture national cigarette paper and invite the Shanghai press to visit. The cigarette paper has already been used by the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company as the first adopter. It cannot be said that our country's national goods business is gradually progressing - good news has arrived, and we are all deeply delighted! The consumption of cigarettes in our country is really alarming! Taking the example of ten cigarettes per person per day, and taking Shanghai as an example, with one million smokers, it requires ten million cigarettes, averaging one cent of national currency per cigarette, costing 100,000 yuan a day! If we combine the national statistics, isn't it alarming? And the percentage of money spent on "paper," turned into ashes, should not be small. The huge leakage is heartbreaking! Therefore, the Minfeng factory's national cigarette paper is especially valuable! I sincerely hope that all national cigarette companies will adopt it unanimously. Because of the national cigarette paper, I think of the newsprint for large leaks, and I hope that in the near future, I will also get a happy news that there is a "national product"!</p>
<h3>The National Goods Movement in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>It has been several years since the Chinese people realized that the influx of foreign goods into the market would cut off China's economic lifeline, and began to launch the national goods movement. However, if we review the past and carefully examine the achievements of the national goods movement in recent years, then what I say will make you feel disappointed. If you don't believe me, we only need to see that the number of excess imports in recent years has still not fallen, and we can conclude that the effect of advocating national goods is minimal! In fact, in this extraordinary period, the Chinese people can no longer perfunctorily deal with the national goods movement, making it only in name and increasing the country's difficulties. Therefore, every citizen, especially in extraordinary times, should understand the importance of advocating national goods and intensify the work of the national goods movement.</p>
<p>The effective way to promote national goods is definitely not to achieve results by talking empty words. The most important point at present is that everyone can lead by example. Local authorities should first implement the use of national goods, so that the civil servants below will also use national goods; school teachers should first use national goods, so that students will not use foreign goods: the head of a family, if he can use national goods himself, the children will dislike using foreign goods. The words say to promote national goods, but the food and utensils at home are mostly foreign goods; elementary school teachers tell students the importance of the national goods movement, but he himself wears a suit; this kind of promotion of national goods, it can be said that the effect is equal to zero, so the promotion of national goods must be based on leading by example!</p>
<p>At the same time, in this extraordinary period, factories can no longer produce shoddy goods, because the low quality of goods in the market will definitely not be able to compete with foreign goods. We have good national goods, so that the Chinese people can use national goods and slowly squeeze foreign goods out of the markets everywhere; therefore, every factory should pay special attention to its own products, carefully study them, and strive for excellence, so that the quality of the goods is excellent, and then can compete with foreign goods. Therefore, national goods factories can no longer ignore their responsibilities, and should improve the quality of their products and improve the manufacturing methods in order to cope with this extraordinary period.</p>
<p>That is, workers, in this extraordinary period, in addition to improving the items they produce, should also do their best to increase the rate of production, because the increase in the rate of production can reduce the cost of national goods, and the cost is lower. Competing with foreign goods, it is naturally easier to obtain profits. Therefore, in this extraordinary period, every worker should understand the importance of the mission he bears, do his best to promote the progress and increase of production, and strive to produce for the society and the country. Of course, it is the greatest duty of workers to cope with this extraordinary period.</p>
<p>The current smuggling problem in North China is so serious that this problem, directly and indirectly, can cause the national goods industry to die and intensify our economic crisis in extraordinary times. In fact, we only need to think carefully, and the so-called smuggling problem is not without a way to deal with it. So what method should be used to deal with it? As long as everyone is of one mind and one virtue and does not use foreign goods, the smuggled goods, in order to evade taxes, can be cheaper in price, but no matter how cheap they are, we will not buy them, then even if there is smuggling of foreign goods, it will not hurt me. Therefore, the determination not to use foreign goods is an effective way to deal with the smuggling problem, where the people of the country can implement the refusal to use foreign goods.</p>
<h3>The Impending Disappearance of Jiangyin Native Cloth</h3>
<p>— Jin Rentong</p>
<p>At a time when we are calling for resisting foreign goods and promoting national goods, there is a kind of genuine national goods that is about to fall into decline. This is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>Those who know the place of Jiangyin all think it is an important national defense town. I don't know that Jiangyin also has a special product of native cloth, which is a kind of farmer's sideline. Jiangyin native cloth is woven from pure national goods yarn. There are roughly two kinds: Du cloth is thicker and suitable for making shirts and pants in cold weather. Factory cloth is thinner and can be used as underclothes in spring and summer, or as outer robes and long shirts. They all have the advantage of being durable. In the past, when the country was closed off, in addition to solving the clothing problem of the people in Jiangyin County; it could also be sold to various places to assist economic circulation. Since foreign goods rushed into the market, due to the growth of users' aesthetic concepts. And the factory's adherence to old methods and failure to make improvements. Not only has the sales volume in foreign ports sharply decreased, but the position of native cloth in the county has gradually shaken. Moreover, the factory is tempted by the low prices of foreign raw materials. Make the native cloth popular in the market, and it will only exist in name.</p>
<p>Resisting foreign goods is the principle of saving the national industry and commerce. And promoting national goods is a prerequisite for resisting foreign goods. National goods should be promoted, how can we allow them to disappear? Then this pure national goods, so that the Jiangyin native cloth that is not worthy of the name, I hope that some experts will study and improve it. I also hope that the general patriotic compatriots will promote and use it. Because it still has the advantage of being durable.</p>
<h3>The Difficulties of the National Goods Industry</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>At present, the most serious problem that the national goods industry feels is the alarming North China smuggling problem. According to a survey by the Greater Shanghai Evening Post reporter, since the North China smuggling problem occurred, the industrial and commercial circles have been seriously affected by the following items:</p>
<p>1. In the past, Shanghai was the hub for the import of silk stockings, but the situation has changed drastically today. The servants of the ships traveling to and from Shanghai and Hong Kong are smuggling large quantities of silk stockings to Shanghai for sale. The profits are higher than their salaries, because the import tax on Shanghai silk stockings is 100%. When these ship servants disembark in Shanghai, they hide the silk stockings in their clothes, and no one can find them when they land.</p>
<p>2. A certain paper merchant talked: At present, there is no trade in North China. The reason why the Shanghai market has not been affected is that a large number of papers are too heavy to be smuggled easily, but it is only a matter of time. Sooner or later, it will be affected.</p>
<p>3. A certain general merchandise manager said: The impact on our business has two types: The first is the Tianjin branch. In the past, the general merchandise stores in Tianjin purchased goods from Shanghai. Since the start of smuggling, all business has been completely gone. Second, some of the goods sold by us have actually been smuggled to various places, and the business future is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>4. …</p>
<p>According to the above, we can know that since the occurrence of the smuggling problem, our industrial and commercial circles have been seriously affected. At a time when the national goods movement has achieved some success. Unfortunately, the North China smuggling problem occurred. This is not only a problem that the North China industrial and commercial circles should urgently pay attention to, but also a major difficulty that cannot be ignored in the entire national goods movement.</p>
<p>The China General Federation of Industry and Commerce said in its report to the Ministry of Industry requesting to stop smuggling in North China: "Smuggling in North China is alarming to the entire country's industry and commerce! The harm to our country's production industry is so deep and great that it is difficult to maintain it now that all industries are depressed. How can we bear this major blow? … Not only the national goods market, but also the influence of our country's tariff revenue, is harmful to the extreme?…" These few words are what we want to say but have not said. In order to protect the nascent national goods industry, the government must use lightning speed to stop the major North China smuggling problem. We must know that this is a difficulty for the national goods industry. If the industrial and commercial circles and the government authorities do not cooperate to solve the North China smuggling problem, the future of national goods is really not optimistic.</p>

The results of this Games show Hungary, Italy, Finland, Sweden, and other countries to be the most prominent. The "Berlin Evening News" stated that many athletes participating in the World Games have broken their own records. This fact cannot but be attributed to the encouragement of general enthusiasm and lofty ideals. When the World Games began, all athletes had already lined up in formation.

They repeatedly made mistakes at critical moments, and thus lost the first set with a score of three to six. In the second set, the American side took the first three games, but they were not easily won. He Jialiu bravely and persistently fought, using short volleys and long shots, and won back two games. After five to two, He Jialiu again served to win a sliding game, making it three to five. In the end, it was difficult to recover due to the mismatch between strength and will.

<h3>Record of the First Day - Joint Annual Meeting of Seven Scientific Societies - Jiang Menglin Explains Two Methods of Scientific Research - Chinese Science Society Elects Ren Hongji and Others as Directors - Bing Zhi Talks About Animal Competition and Survival, Detailing Darwin's Theory</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The 21st Annual Meeting of the Chinese Science Society, the 2nd Annual Meeting of the Mathematical Society, the 5th Annual Meeting of the Physical Society, the 4th Annual Meeting of the Chemical Society, the 3rd Annual Meeting of the Zoological Society, the 4th Annual Meeting of the Botanical Society, and the 3rd Annual Meeting of the Geographical Society have all been under preparation for a long time. These seven scientific societies held a joint annual meeting today (the 17th) at Tsinghua University in the western suburbs of Beiping. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, and the Chinese Science Society held a board meeting and public lectures in the afternoon. Tsinghua University also opened an academic exhibition. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Members of the seven societies from various places arrived in Beiping separately yesterday. This morning (the 17th) from 8:00 to 10:00 AM, registration continued, with a total of over 400 members arriving. At 10:00 AM, the opening ceremony was held in the auditorium of Tsinghua University. In addition to all the members, guests Wang Lengzhai, Yuan Tongli, Zha Liangzhao, etc., totaling over 600 people, were also present. The chairman of the conference, Jiang Menglin, gave the opening speech, stating that today is the opening day of the joint annual meeting of the seven academic societies. Many members of the societies from other places have come to participate. He would like to briefly express his welcome on behalf of the academic circles of Beiping. There are two ways to research academics: one is for individuals to bury themselves in research in libraries or laboratories, and the other is to gather many people together to discuss together. Thus, the organization of academic societies began. Today is the day for members of the societies to begin gathering. He hopes that they can make considerable contributions to the country, society, and culture. In China, whether in social sciences or natural sciences, there have been organizations of academic societies in recent years, separately and collectively discussing a problem, and there have been significant achievements. The beginning of science is due to questions. Of course, the questions in the universe are not just the falling of an apple. Many unresolved or undiscovered problems await our resolution. It is expected that from this moment of budding, great fruits will be born. At this moment, he would like to take this opportunity to bless the health and eternal progress of the seven scientific societies and all colleagues. Then, Mei Yiqi gave a welcoming speech on behalf of the academic circles of Ping City, followed by a speech by Wang Lengzhai on behalf of the mayor of Beiping. He stated that it is an honor to attend the opening of the joint annual meeting of the seven academic societies today. Mayor Qin originally planned to come in person, but due to temporary matters, he was afraid that he would not be able to arrive on time, so he specifically asked him to represent him. At the same time, Mayor Qin also represented the 1.5 million citizens of Beiping to welcome everyone and expressed a few hopes: (1) Science should be applied to society and should be expanded nationwide. Although the seven societies now have members in various places, it is still hoped that they will continue to expand and become national organizations. (2) Foreigners often study a certain subject from their youth to their old age. This spirit of persistence should be our model, so that our research work can also be long-term and continuous. (3) Because science is not developed in our country, many great raw materials must be sold to foreigners for manufacturing and then shipped back to China, absorbing capital. Those of you who study various sciences should have the same feeling. He hopes that they will work tirelessly and strive for progress. Then, member representative Ren Hongjun gave a reply speech. At 12:00 noon, the photo session was dismissed.</p>
<p>Parties Hosted by Various Parties</p>
<p>After the meeting, Tsinghua University hosted a lunch for all members and guests in the first dining hall. The seats were prepared by Jiei Ying Western food. Over 600 people used their knives and forks and toasted each other. Although there was no scene of glittering lights and wine, this grand occasion was also rare in the academic world. During the meal, the host Mei Yiqi also gave a modest speech, saying that he was ashamed that the school's hospitality was not adequate for those who had come from afar. Before lunch was over, Chairman Song expressed his regret for not being able to attend due to official business. He has now scheduled to prepare a small feast at Huai Ren Tang in Zhongnanhai at 6:00 PM the day after tomorrow, hoping that everyone will honor him with their presence. Qin Dechun also expressed at the same time that in order to save time for everyone's official business, the arrangement for him to host at Zhongshan Hall is planned to be changed to the same time as Chairman Song's banquet, so as to enhance the joy. At 2:00 PM, everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Chinese Science Society Board Meeting</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the Chinese Science Society held a board meeting in the Tongfang Department of Tsinghua. Ren Hongjun chaired the meeting and said that he was very pleased that members from various places had gathered together for today's meeting. The existence of the Science Society today is due to everyone's efforts. Yang Xiaoshu's report stated that the progress of the society's affairs in the past two years is as follows: (1) Promoting advanced research: The Nanjing Biological Research Institute is working hard on research. (2) Popularizing scientific knowledge: Expanding science libraries in Nanjing and Shanghai. (3) Publishing two regular publications: Science Monthly, with monthly sales of 3,000 copies, and Science Pictorial (bi-monthly), with monthly sales of 15,000 copies. The society is carrying out its work according to the above two principles. The society has a total of 11 staff members in Shanghai and 31 in Nanjing. The number of members has increased significantly this year, with 99 new members, bringing the total to 2,500. The Alumni Association has long been established in ten places: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Wuzhou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Qingdao. This year, Alumni Associations have been newly established in Chengdu and Tianjin. In terms of donations, Jin Shuchu donated shellfish books worth 50,000 yuan and another US$300. Ye Shanding donated 2,000 medical books. Chen Zongnan donated 50 yuan for Science Pictorial. Two scientific experts were invited: the physiologist Karlsen and the mathematician Hadamard. Xiang Bingzhi reported on the situation of the Biological Research Institute. There is considerable exchange of academic research with the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Russia in international relations. The Accounting Editor reported one after another. Finally, the staff was elected, and the results are as follows: (1) Seven directors were re-elected: Ren Hongjun, Hu Xianqi, Zhou Ren, Li Siguang, Wang Jin, Sun Hongfen, and Yan Jici were elected. (2) Two auditors were elected: He Dekui and Chen Qinghua. (3) Three election committee members were elected: Wu Xianwen, Dong Shijin, and Yuan Hanqing. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Question of Animal Competition and Survival</p>
<p>At 4:10 PM in the afternoon, a public lecture was held in the Biology Museum. Animal expert Bing Zhi gave a lecture on the survival of animals. In addition to members of the Zoological Society, there were Tsinghua biology teachers and students and guests, totaling over 400 people. First, President Hu Jingfu gave an introduction. Then, Bing took the stage to give a lecture, stating that there are nearly one million species of animals, which is more than the number of species of plants. The results of zoologists' research have found over 900,000 species so far. Insects account for more than two-thirds. There are more insects than stars. Because of the suitability and unsuitability of animals to the environment, a distinction between breeding and elimination has evolved. Because animal reproduction and breeding are geometric progressions, the result of competition and conflict is harm and extinction, which can be seen anywhere. The issue of animal competition and survival can be divided into two parts: (1) Animals' resistance to the environment: (1) Resistance to climate. During the Ice Age, it was suddenly extremely cold. Animals could not resist this extremely cold climate and froze to death. Glyptodon, which was originally a Tank Armediils elephant, Mastodon, and Grart Slotk were all large animals and froze to death because they could not resist the climate. Other animals with thick fur, such as camels and rhinoceroses, can resist the climate and do not freeze to death. (2) The relationship with food. Reptiles and dinosaurs eat many plants. Once the plants change, herbivores, reptiles, and large salamanders all starve to death, while ordinary reptiles and toothed animals survive. Because small animals have less food intake, they can survive. (3) The impact of disease. Large animals have small parasitic animals on their bodies. If small animals are sick, large animals also die from the disease. When I was a student, I saw Eurosta (flies) with parasites on their bodies called Eurotonea in the first year. In the second year, I didn't see these flies anymore, which shows the impact of disease. (2) Animals' own or conspecific or heterospecific killings: (1) Food. Food is limited in an area. Animals compete with each other, and conspecifics or heterospecifics kill each other. The weak starve to death or are killed. The fact that cats eat mice is the easiest to see. According to zoologists, ruminants such as cattle and horses store food in their stomachs because they compete with other animals for food. After the other animals leave, they ruminate and spit it out before eating it again. This is the origin of ancient ruminants. (2) Space. Animals compete for territory. The strong kill the weak, or the weak escape. England originally had many black rats. Later, Norwegian gray rats invaded England. A few years later, the black rats became extinct, and England was occupied by Norwegian rats. This is the result of competing for territory. (3) Mates. When a male sparrow courts a female sparrow, two male sparrows must fight. As a result, the weak fail and die, and the strong snatch the female sparrow. This result of competing for mates is enough to cause one side to become extinct. He hopes that the young people present will not kill each other because of this issue. (The whole place roared with laughter.) American Horndacc specializes in sexual fighting. The weak have no wives and will never have offspring, resulting in many extinctions. Humans are also animals. Because they can prevent natural and man-made disasters, they can resist the environment. Cultural aggression and military aggression between countries are also related to the survival competition. Darwin's theory of evolution is at least partially reliable. Human brains are developed, so they can conquer everything. The lecture ended at 5:40, and the whole audience applauded and dispersed.</p>
<p>Tsinghua Academic Exhibition</p>
<p>Tsinghua University held an academic exhibition today (the 17th) to welcome the seven scientific societies. All the exhibitions were presented in the Biology Museum. 1. Agricultural Products Exhibition: Over a thousand kinds of agricultural products are displayed, including those with research results: (1) Mole crickets are most harmful to sorghum and corn. The department has invented white mail stone, which can cure mole cricket nodules. (2) Milk is concentrated on the tree and can cure aphids. (3) Grape golden bugs are treated with Paris green. (4) Maize earworms are easily known to have earworms, and 80% are affected. They are being treated with cold temperature methods and are currently under research. 2. Animal life wave, the following tests listed by Zhao Yibing Wang Zhi: (1) Bottom temperature stimulates meat, electrical current stimulates muscles, measurement of free radicals concentration. 3. Wood Exhibition: Biology students collected over 50 kinds of wood, including new records: red paper birch, white paper birch. 4. Fish Pond is divided into two parts: (1) Goldfish genetics. Department Head Chen Sunxi has carefully studied and discovered many hereditary properties. (2) Studying animal sociology, animal psychology, animal social organization, animal cooperation, solving the principles of human society, using ants as test products, because ants have cooperation like human society (Jin)</p>

<h3>Junior High School Geography Textbook Map: Tan Lian's Latest Masterpiece</h3>
<p>In recent years, maps published in the market have been improving with each passing day, showing considerable progress. However, finding one that complements the textbook and is suitable for the curriculum is rare. The Junior High School Geography Textbook Map, recently published by the Zhonghua Cartographic Society and compiled by Tan Lian, has changed various previous publishing habits. Not only are the place names adopted based on the junior high school geography textbooks published by various publishers, but the name of each map is also distributed according to the latest revised geography curriculum standards, such as the central region, southern region, and other local maps; the national defense map for national defense; the Zhongshan Railway Plan map for the Zhongshan Plan; and the Zhongshan Improved Harbor and River Management Plan map. These are all indispensable maps for junior high school geography. Instead of using the same old descriptions after the map, the latest statistical tables of various industries and transportation are used for reference, which can supplement the shortcomings of textbooks and is a special feature. Moreover, the county names in the map are selectively drawn, and the place names not adopted in the textbooks are omitted except for those that are particularly important. As a result, the characters are sparse and particularly clear, and the colors are bright and very eye-catching. The railway, highway, aviation, and other lines are drawn according to the latest traffic routes. It can be called the best educational map without shame, and the price is also cheap. The current special price is seven jiao, distributed by Qinfen Bookstore at 277 Sima Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: New Yao Cotton Arrives in Shanghai, Cotton Prices Plummet, Distant Months Drop More Than Six Jiao Each, Only Yao Cotton Remains Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market has plummeted, and the situation is extremely volatile. Because the weather has cleared, the hurricane has changed direction, the cotton seedlings are neat everywhere, and the new cotton is developing vigorously. New Yao cotton from Ningbo has arrived in Shanghai, and the quality and color are bright and clear. Therefore, people's hearts are shaken, and the market price cannot be supported.</p>
<p>Changhe Sells in Large Quantities: The pre-market opening of the spot cotton market showed that American cotton was firm and active, rising six to eleven points. Indian cotton rose 0.75 to 2.25 rupees. Osaka's three cotton varieties were flat. The market sentiment was weak because the weather was clear, the hurricane had changed direction, and new cotton was gradually entering the market at low prices. Gengfeng and Changhe sold huge quantities, and the counter was particularly loose. However, Shenji and Dachang's offsetting was also considerable, but it was still difficult to reverse the downward trend. As a result, each month fell three jiao to three jiao and a half compared to the closing price of the previous day, and August fell one jiao. The afternoon opening showed that the momentum was still depressed. The market spread that the cotton production situation in all parties was satisfactory and that it would soon be available in large quantities. Changhe and Fukang sold off even more fiercely, so the selling atmosphere was strong, and the price fell step by step. As a result, each month fell another two and a half to three and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. This month's price remained unchanged. It was found that Changhe issued 13,900 dan, Fukang 7,400 dan, Tonghe 4,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dan, Xingchang 1,200 dan, Tongji 2,600 dan, Gengfeng 7,200 dan, Fengtai 2,300 dan, Changfeng 2,400 dan, and Xinxing 1,400 dan. The buying included Mingde 3,100 dan, Hexing 2,500 dan, Shenchang 1,100 dan, Shenji 6,700 dan, Taichang 2,400 dan, Yichang 5,700 dan, and Dafeng 2,600 dan, Zhenda 4,500 dan. The highest and lowest market prices during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>New Factories Need Continuously: Spot cotton consumption is ordinary, but new cotton factories need it continuously, but there is no source, it is said. New Zhangde 53.50 Rihua Factory purchased 500 pieces New Yao Cotton for factory delivery in October and November 43.75 Gengfeng Factory purchased 3,000 bales Also Also</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Falls, Yarn Market Feels More Unsupported, Bulls Close Out, Shorts Add to Positions, Near and Distant Months Fall About Two Yuan, Another Thousand Bales of New Yarn Unloaded</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and its decline is even more serious. Because raw cotton has fallen sharply, the yarn market is more difficult to stabilize. At the same time, the actual demand is not as smooth as the previous day. When people's hearts are tired, speculators take the opportunity to move, and the market declines step by step. Approximately more than a thousand bales of new yarn have been unloaded this month.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sellers Cut Losses One After Another: The pre-market opening of the spot yarn market showed that the current month's spot price rose due to the rise in American cotton and the extreme tightness of the spot yarn base. People's hearts were good, and the market tended to rise. However, when shooting to the linked period, the situation changed from month to month, and the selling atmosphere was stronger and frustrated. After the second session, the decline resumed because raw cotton fell, the Osaka three yarn market was weak, people's hearts were weaker, and the market price fell step by step. Changheng Chang closed out long positions, and Dachang added short positions. However, Xincheng Dafu also made considerable offsetting. As a result, each month fell five jiao to one yuan and one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening continued to decline. It was heard that yarn sales were not as strong as the previous day, and most speculators cut their losses. The market atmosphere became more depressed. As a result, each month fell another eight or nine jiao to one yuan and twelve jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dachang sold 1,700 bales,  1,300 bales, Ren 1,800 bales, Chang 3,300 giant bales, Xie 800 bales,  1,100 bales, Shenji 1,200 bales, Taichang 900 bales, Dafu purchased 2,150 bales, Tongji 2,100 bales, Mingde 800 bales, Hexing 2,650 bales, Dachangcheng 1,050 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, Dachang 900 bales, and Xincheng 1,500 bales. The highest and lowest prices during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Have More Than a Thousand Bales: Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,181 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell five jiao to one yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Xiamen Dou 10, Same Industry 60, Guangdong 365, Henan 306, Changsha 200</p>
<p>Wuhu 5, Inland 155, Yunnan 30, Xuzhou 10, Shantou 35</p>
<p>Fujian 15</p>
<h3>American Cotton in the West Still Too Dry, Wall Street Buys and Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened sluggishly. The price rose eight to ten points each month due to good news from Liverpool, continued dryness and heat in the western cotton region, and slight buying by the industry and foreign merchants. It then retreated due to selling by local gangs and New Orleans, and slight hedging. At the closing, it was reported that there were storms near the Texas Gulf Coast, and drought continued in Oklahoma and North Dakota. Wall Street bought, and the market rose again. Spot demand is calm, and the spot price in Texas is soft. As a result, the spot price rose seven points, and the futures price rose nine to fourteen points. British cotton spot rose eleven points, and futures rose eight points. Indian cotton rose due to poor harvest and buying by a few in the industry. The cotton field report was irrelevant. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose 0.75 rupees, Omlara rose 1.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast on the 18th for the July-August Bairoxi was 223.5 rupees, and the April-May Bairoxi was 213.5 rupees, both up 0.25 rupees. The December-January Irmlara was 194.5 rupees, up 1.5 rupees.</p>

<p>-- Surveyed on August 15th --</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Autumn Sales of Piece Goods Start, Shipping and Ordering Are Extremely Busy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of cotton cloth turned firm. Because various factories threw out fancy goods and white goods, and various customer gangs were urging delivery due to the start of autumn sales, the spot goods were in short supply. In recent days, the spot yarn and cotton have been unusually brisk, and the dyeing plants are slightly tired because customer gangs have not extensively purchased dyed embryos, eastern goods, fine cloth, and fine twill. If the current sales show a turnaround, there is hope for a rebound. Most of the loan sales counters are as before, and people's hearts are also very stable. The customer gangs' appetite is still the strongest in Sichuan and Hunan. In addition to the ordered goods, new purchases of straight-line drill, serge, twill flannel, bleached flannel, sesame flannel, printed flannel, fine cloth, fine twill, and other goods have been very busy for shipment in recent days. The sales of white goods in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Taizhou in Zhejiang Road have been very weak in the past two months, but they have gradually become active yesterday. More than one hundred pieces of light-pound coarse cloth from Yihua Shenxin and other factories have been purchased, mostly to meet the needs of flower bags. Seventy or eighty pieces of printed flannel, double-sided flannel, white flannel, plain direct-buy serge, and other goods have been purchased. The demand from the northern gangs in Tianjin and Tianjin continues to be good. In the past two days, more than one hundred bales of Yihua Factory's sixteen-pound Five Blessings coarse cloth have been purchased, and two hundred more pieces of other Shenxin Dasheng Qingfeng and other factory products have also been purchased. Among the fancy goods, the demand for deep-ground printed satin, plain straight tribute serge, and variegated crepe, new patterned crepe is the strongest, showing a good sign. However, the areas of Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi have gradually become quiet. At present, the sales of printed flannel are the most popular, which has led to a large shortage of flannel embryos on the market.</p>
<h3>Woolen Market Also Sees Progress</h3>
<p>The golden wind sends coolness, and the new autumn has arrived. The woolen trade is gradually starting, and the market is also expanding accordingly. Customer routes such as Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other gangs have strong appetites, and the cheap autumn goods are also being absorbed by various parties in this street. The spot goods of foreign firms have gradually been replaced. The market situation of domestic goods and goods imported from the East and West is good, and the market is also firm. If the rotten paste wool, Melton, plain thick wool, yellow wool, low-end straight tribute wool, medium-thick serge, Chongsi Poak, and other items are more developed in sales. Many in the industry have been ordering goods from foreign firms in recent days, and the number of original boxes declared and transported to other places by the transportation company for export and postal parcels is also very large.</p>
<h3>Finance: Pure Gold Rises... Many Floating Profits Close, Spot Gold Has No Honor or Disgrace</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was more stable because pure gold rebounded. Although it was still prosperous midway, there was no shortage of people taking profits at high prices, and buyers gradually became satisfied. As a result, it was flat. In the early morning, it was said that the overseas silver market was flat in both England and the United States. The large-scale speculators said that there was a lack of buyers after the market closed, and the market was flat and tired. The Montedori forward silver price was unchanged and rose five hao. The exchange rate fell slightly, and London raw gold rose one penny. The Central Bank's listing was announced, and England and the United States were both flat. The customs gold unit rose two li, and the standard spot gold price listing rose to 1125.6 yuan. The over-the-counter preparatory transactions rose to 28.67 yuan due to Dadecheng, Dingkang, Shendayong, and Natiao. The morning opened high, and then slightly tired. However, due to the purchase of spot firms, there was a rumor that the central government would open the spot at par, and it gradually rebounded. The HSBC Bank's listing of the British and American exchange rates did not change, and the silver balance tax announcement was also flat. There was not much impact in the middle. However, the price dropped slightly because someone took profits at high prices, but there was more struggle. Later, the price fell slightly at noon because the guest users were satisfied, there was a lack of maintenance in the market, and many floating profits were closed. The swap period has retreated to 1.9 yuan yesterday. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>

After the opening, the banks were slightly congested and turned flat. HSBC Bank's listing was announced, and the British and American prices were flat, and the silver balance tax was also flat. It was extremely peaceful in the middle. After entering, the banks did swaps, and the general trend showed a wandering state. It lasted until noon, and it was still the same as the number of swaps at the beginning. There were still many swap transactions in the later market. Chinese merchants and others were still optimistic. The first report of Indian silver was small Anna, and the second report did not move, and there was no impact. At the closing, the recent selling price was British pound 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375 and 40625 paired, and the US exchange rate was 30.125 yuan, which was flat for the British and American exchanges compared to the previous closing.

<h3>Securities: Different Choices for Swaps, Public Bonds Rise and Fall, Market Situation is Brewing for Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange tended to be in a spin, and there was a sign of brewing change. Most of the gangs are still waiting and watching. Sellers are still mostly numbers 4, 10, and 16. The trend is high and low, and the future may change. Yesterday's transactions were mostly swaps, and the market price fluctuated slightly. The first session was initially firm and then tired, slightly less than five fen, one jiao to three jiao. The second session was chaotic because of the different choices of swaps. The market price still rose and fell between five fen and one or two jiao. The market opened in the afternoon, and number 6 absorbed slightly, and the trend was slightly firmer, and it rose consistently from one jiao to three jiao and a half. The list before closing was still firm, and it continued to be better by about one jiao. The two categories A and B went down by one or two jiao, and the situation was not good. The market price of category A was too high. It was just after the lottery was held, and there was a lot of spot goods flowing out of the counter. Moreover, category A has always been very strong, so those who do more gather here, so it is inevitable that they want to squeeze more. As a result, the market price continued to rise by five fen, one jiao to three jiao. Only category D was lowered by five fen due to the flow of spot goods from number 72 in the near future. Category A was lowered by two jiao due to the exit of floating profits. The total number of transactions was 6,585,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed below. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Price is Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall, Overseas Reports Rise and Fall... Yesterday's Increase Was Three or Four Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, presented a situation of gradual and violent rise in each month. The overseas wheat quotation in Chicago and Canada rose about five or six jiao, so after opening, the market situation in each month was consistently active, and it was raised by two, three, or four fen compared to the closing price of the previous day. For a time, the buying atmosphere was激昂, seemingly beyond expectations. Because overseas wheat quotations fluctuate frequently, it is impossible to make excessive use of them. However, people inside and outside the industry focus on the imbalance of international prices, so regardless of how the sales market is, and regardless of the people's food, they still take doing more as their goal. The market's easy rise and difficult fall is probably the reason for this. In the later sessions, the spot month was stable because the filling of shorts was smoother, and the rest had turned to a spin, observing the subsequent steps. If there is no method of adjustment, the market atmosphere will still be difficult to calm down.</p>
<h3>Supplies Nearly Exhausted, Wheat Futures Hit New Highs, Spot Wheat Opens at $5.10</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed an upward trend across all months during the morning session. This was due to foreign wheat quotations rebounding by 96 cents and the market's perception that wheat stocks were low, with prices in the interior higher than in Shanghai. This situation gradually solidified market sentiment. Although the price increases in each month were not significant, the market value had already reached its peak, with August futures reaching $5.07. This price level was unprecedented in the past three or four years. Distant-month futures also saw good sentiment, with opening prices rising by 3 to 5 cents. Afterward, trading became brisk, and prices hovered. The spot wheat market was favorable due to decent milling demand, and customers were raising prices. High-quality wheat was up another 5 cents, with Linhuai Guan and Wuhe wheat reaching a high of $5.10, followed by $5.05. Yanghe, Shaheji, and Zhangbaling wheat were at $5.01, Wu Yi wheat at $5.00, Huai'an wheat at $5.05, then $5.00, Bengbu wheat at $5.04, then $5.01, and then $4.95. Hankou wheat was at $4.96, then $4.88, then $4.83. Five thousand bags were shipped by Fu Lan, four thousand by Xin, and one thousand by Shen Da, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Unpolished Rice Floods In, Prices Drop Two to Three Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer rice market was quite active, but prices fluctuated, not uniformly soaring despite the active trading. Generally, old stocks of various customer rices and machine-polished rice saw price increases of one to two cents due to lively trading on the local street and customer demand. However, unpolished rice prices dropped by two to three cents due to the influx of new goods and active arrivals from all routes. Producers in producing areas also advocated selling off goods at market prices, with many telegrams requesting sales. Brokers competed to sell on their behalf, causing market prices to fall. However, after the price drop, unpolished rice sales were still good. It is estimated that 5,000 bags of Shashi unpolished rice were opened, while machine-polished rice included 1,770 bags of Gan rice, 3,160 bags of Xiang rice, and 840 bags of Wen Tai rice. These were distributed from the local street to the interior, Xiamen, Shantou, Beiyang, Ningbo, and other places.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Economic Research Department of the Central Bank Releases Production Index for April</h3>
<p>Due to seasonal factors, the production volume of major industries in January, February, and March of this year showed a slight decrease, but April saw significant improvement compared to the spring, increasing by about 10%. May saw a slight decline, also due to seasonal influences. The Central Bank's recently released production index is listed in the table below. This index began compilation last year, and the methodology was revised this year. The calculation method is detailed in the Central Bank Monthly, Volume 5, Number 6, and the Central Bank English Quarterly, Volume 2, Number 2. Readers can review these. China Production Index (Monthly Average for 1933-1935 = 100)</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Sales in Shantou Market Very Active, Foreign Firms Expand Sesame Seed Holdings, New Soybeans Trend Flat</h3>
<p>Foreign firms have been holding sesame seeds for the past two days. Although foreign firms sent telegrams at $12.78 the day before yesterday, there has been no response from abroad as of yesterday, so no transactions have been made. Few people in the market are selling because there is still little certainty about the harvest this year. Only general dealers are active in the market, so asking prices are rising daily, with some considering selling at $13, leading to a lack of transactions between the two sides. Except for soybeans from Chengmen, which see some activity from small-scale millers, and the fact that stocks are accumulating, causing prices to continue to fall by 5 to 6 cents, the rest are trending flat. Sales are also sluggish. It is estimated that 3 to 4 thousand bags of various beans were opened, and the future is not optimistic. Soybean cake sales in Shantou are increasingly active, with prices rising by 1 to 2 cents, and 17 to 18 thousand pieces of various factory brands were sold.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: New Honey Dates Still Arriving in Small Quantities</h3>
<p>Since the new honey dates came on the market, the harvest in the producing areas has been poor this year, and the cost of raw dates is relatively high, so the quantity of goods arriving from Jiaxing, Lanxi, and other places has been small in recent days. The market is gradually trending flat. In previous years, Lanxi products were superior to Jiaxing goods, but the current goods are inferior. Yesterday's market price for bald dates was $35, the same price as Jiaxing goods. Top-grade dates are priced higher as usual. The market is temporarily stable. If more goods arrive in later batches, there may be hope for a loosening.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tung Oil Plummets, Hankow Telegram Reports Foreign Firms Dropping to 54 Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the large quantities of tung oil being transported from Guangxi Province to Hunan Province for sale, the price of tung oil has plummeted recently. Half a month ago, foreign firms in the Macau market were still at around 75 yuan per picul, but in just ten days, it has fallen to 60 yuan. The situation remains depressed. Unexpectedly, last night, this port received a telegram from Hankow stating that the price has plummeted to 54 yuan, a catastrophic decline. However, because the fall has been so rapid, any movement is sensitive. If there is a slight turnaround, the change will also be rapid.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Ye Zhongxun)</p>
<p>Patience and motivation, like loyalty, have the power to move mountains and overturn seas. When there is still hope for a matter, do not give up, but also do not hope beyond reason. This indicates that your ambition has exceeded the bounds." Pana tells us that within the realm of possibility, hope is the companion of strength, the mother of success. Because those who have resolute hope do not harbor any desires for unexpected things. Behind hope follows courage, so Catherine said: "I beg you to summon courage, this brave spirit can eliminate all disasters." Napoleon said: "Energy of character is the foundation of true hope, a strong heart always holds hope… even when all is lost, it can still maintain itself! Its own perfection and value hope awakens courage, and despair is the last of all evils, it is the abandonment of welfare! A complete retreat from the battlefield of life." As long as our hope has not been extinguished, courage will always accompany us, because hope is backed by courage.</p>
<h3>Melon Eaters and Melon Growers</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Watermelon, with its refreshing fragrance and sweetness, is said by medical experts to have considerable nutritional value for the human body. Therefore, in recent years, although soda, ice cream, fresh orange juice, shaved ice, and other cold drinks have occupied a large position among summer cold drinks, watermelon is still selling well without obstruction. In every household, watermelons are still piled up in corners, and the streets are filled with the shouts of watermelon vendors. It is truly worthy to say "Long live watermelon."</p>
<p>Urban dwellers, because of the high price of melons, often envy the rural people who grow watermelons. And some people often reveal in their conversations, "Rural people are really happy, they can pick a watermelon from the field to eat, how enjoyable!" However, "Though fields stretch to the four seas, the farmer still starves," these words can also be used to describe watermelon growers. The author grew up in a rural village and knows a thing or two about the lives of farmers. Although the distance from planting seedlings to harvesting watermelons is shorter than growing grains, if the price of melons is high, then eating one melon is like eating the profit of one melon. If the price of melons is low, then the farmer spends capital and labor, and the proceeds from selling are not even enough to pay rent, causing them to worry to the point of tears in their eyes, unable to eat with relish, unable to sleep soundly, so where would they have the mood to eat watermelon? Therefore, in rural villages, there are often fields full of ripe melons, but the watermelon growers are still drinking water from the ditches to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>The biggest enemies of watermelons in the fields are badgers, foxes, hedgehogs and the like. These animals often sneak into the melon fields at night to steal melons. Therefore, watermelon growers usually set up tents next to the melon fields to guard them. Once they see such animals appear, they gather neighbors to help watch and drive them away or arrest them. At the same time, watermelon thieves are also very active. After guarding so carefully and cautiously until the melons are ripe, they pick them and sell them to melon vendors to recover the capital and labor costs spent on growing the melons. If the melons ripen too early, before the weather has become scorching hot, then this season's hard work is only left to a sigh. Because when the weather is cool, it is difficult to get a good price. If the melons ripen during the height of summer, clearing the stomach and making one feel refreshed, then the watermelon grower will have a slight smile on their face, which is even darker than the skin of pickled ginger. But during the day, when planting watermelons, they suffer from the summer heat, and at night, when guarding, they suffer from the cold. By the time summer passes and autumn arrives, the melon eaters have already grown tired of eating watermelons, and the watermelon growers are found at the entrance of the village. In addition to compasses, sundials are also their unique business. Sundials sell best in Hunan.</p>
<p>Melon eaters are indeed lucky, and melon growers are indeed pitiable. However, if melon eaters pity the watermelon growers and do not eat watermelons, then that would be terrible, as it would be cutting off the watermelon growers' source of livelihood. Therefore, every year when watermelons come on the market, "Should I eat watermelons? The watermelon growers are too pitiable." "Should I not eat watermelons? How will the watermelon growers live?" These two contradictory but reasonably valid viewpoints are always circling in my mind.</p>
<h3>Natural Refrigerator</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In times when science was not very developed, eating popsicles in June would really be considered an earth-shattering and impossible thing. But now, we have sanitary machine-made ice; we have natural ice stored for freezing in winter; and we have "ice cream" and "shaved ice" produced in connection with ice. In the hot summer, ice is an indispensable thing for every household in the city to cool their hearts and minds.</p>
<p>In the past, when there was no machine-made ice and no way to preserve natural ice, people used well water as a refrigerator. Because well water is deep underground, its temperature is lower than general water. If you have leftover food, you are afraid that it will spoil overnight, so you often hang it in the well. Also, if you cook cold jelly and want it to freeze quickly, you also soak it in well water. In addition, melons and fruits are also soaked in well water to keep them cool. Don't you see that well water in summer is like a refrigerator today? Moreover, at that time, most families did not have tap water. If they lived far from a river, they would almost all dig a well for washing clothes and vegetables, so this natural refrigerator was quite common. When I was young, I relied entirely on this well water for cold food in the summer!</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang are low-lying and watery, so digging a well is not a difficult task. Digging two or three feet deep into the ground will produce clear and deep well water. In the past, there were also specialized workers who dug wells, commonly called "hook and bait craftsmen." I am afraid that this industry no longer exists in Shanghai. Well digging took place in hot weather, and the craftsmen had to drink enough white wine and wear a broken cotton-padded jacket when they reached the bottom of the well, which shows the temperature at the bottom of the well. The form of an ordinary well is small at the top and wide at the bottom; from the bottom of the well to the ground, it is built with tiles to prevent the mud from collapsing; the top is a well railing, which is chiseled from stone, in circular, square, and hexagonal shapes. Water is drawn with a wooden bucket, tied with a palm rope. There are also some small techniques for drawing water. Those who are used to it will put the bucket on the surface of the water and shake the rope slightly, and they will get a bucket of clear and deep well water. Those who are not used to it will thump! Thump! Using all their strength, the water is both turbid and the bucket is not full. It is now rare to see such well water in Shanghai, but if you go to the interior, there are quite a few.</p>
<h3>Reading Paintings from the Huifeng Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Yan Zairu</p>
<p>Kuang Junyou of Lingui, also known as Han Weiqi, is the wise son of the poet of the Huifeng Pavilion. He has inherited the family's scholarship, is skilled in poetry and calligraphy, and also likes painting. He held a gift to enter the gate of He Shisun and Jiang Yingsheng, and tirelessly practiced painting day and night. The landscapes he creates are simple, sparse and vigorous, sweeping away the habits of coarse expansion and overbearing. In recent times, those who learn to paint mostly fear difficulties and seek ease, painting with rough branches and large leaves, and then boast that they have obtained the Dharma milk of Bada Shanren and Shitao. There are few who can discuss ancient methods. Mr. Kuang relies on his natural talent and also learns from famous teachers, so he can understand the essence of this art. He has extensively viewed the famous works of past masters collected by Wang Xicun and Kang Gengsheng. He has virtually copied all of them, so he can break away from the mundane styles and not specialize in one school. Last year, I requested a landscape folding fan painting from him, which was simple, vigorous, and elegant, quite embodying the spirit of Pan Lianchao. On the other side, it was paired with Liu Jungonglu's running script. Both gentlemen are sons of famous fathers, and those who saw it all said that they were evenly matched. Recently, Han Yifu has also devoted himself to painting, and his progress is even more remarkable than before. Therefore, in response to the request of friends, he will, on the twenty-second of this month, hold an exhibition at the Great Eastern Hotel, displaying nearly a hundred small landscape paintings and fan paintings for several days for the public to view. I know that there are many enthusiasts in Shanghai, and I foresee that they will compete to purchase them, and will also inspire Korean merchants.</p>
<h3>A New Home for the Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Good Fortune Repeatedly Depicted on Green Leaves, Bridal Dress Startlingly Tried On, Tears Wetting the Gauze</p>
<p>After dinner, Menglan seemed to have something urgent to do, and hurriedly ran upstairs. She closed the door, and sat under the lamp in a daze. It seemed that she had found a solution to a problem. She immediately stood up, opened the box, and took out the letter with the poem written by Guoqi to read it again. This gave her an idea. Then, she placed all the drawing tools she used for school drawing assignments on the table. From the book box, she picked out a very good double-ply Xuan paper, cut a piece more than a foot long, and laid it on the table. Then, she sat upright in the chair, facing the blank paper, paying close attention to it for a long time. It was as if someone was sitting under the lamp, discussing something with her. So, after she smiled slightly, she dipped her brush into the paint palette with plenty of color, and in one breath, without stopping, she drew four or five green, long and short orchid leaves on the paper. Then, she used a lighter green to outline a stalk of orchid. Among them, there were two more mature flowers, to which she added a light purple. Below the flower stalk, she applied powder and carefully outlined it with carmine. These few strokes of flowers and plants were truly graceful and charming. She did not think that the painting had too few strokes, and immediately put down the brush. She stood outside the table two or three feet away, held her hands in her arms, and stared at the painting. Suddenly, she frowned slightly, as if she felt a kind of melancholy again. After a long time, she muttered to herself: How should I sign it? After she finished speaking, she completely removed the drawing tools from the table, and then pinned the painting on the wall with drawing tacks. She sat on the chair, leaning sideways, staring at the painting in a daze, while raising one hand to gently support her left cheek. After she had pondered for half an hour, she finally figured out how to sign it. This method of signing, even when it reached Guoqi's hands, Guoqi felt it was very appropriate. This painting reached Guoqi's hands when it was already. Originally, after Guoqi sent the letter, he seemed to have tied a knot in his heart again. The words in the letter might cause someone to become angry and submit the letter to their parents. If the parents saw it, they could tolerate it and let it go. If they did not tolerate it, the trouble would be no small matter. Thinking carefully, it was always his own fault. He should not have used words to provoke a young lady. From now on, no matter how confused he was, he would never write a single word to her again. Respecting others is also respecting oneself. It would be at least thirty years before Chinese men and women reached the level of open communication. It would be too early to use Western customs as a comparison. With this thought, in addition to completely fading the desire to pursue Miss Jiang, he also bore a sense of fear in his heart, feeling that there was a faint fire constantly burning in his heart.

<h3>Spring in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jiang Gong</p>
<p>When I lived in Qiantang, I wandered around the lake every day and night, but I never really appreciated the beauty of the West Lake's mountains and waters. Then I traveled to Beijing, and after living there for a long time, I still did not know the beauty of the old capital. Now, I think about it a little, and I quite hate that I wasted the beautiful scenery in front of me. I am afraid that I will inevitably be ridiculed for swallowing scallops whole, and I feel even more ashamed and regretful. This is like sitting opposite a beautiful woman, and completely forgetting the beauty of her eyebrows. After the illusion is shattered and dispersed, there is longing for the beauty. Only then do I realize that her demeanor is perfect, and every detail of her sleeves and skirt is beautiful, but the paradise is so close, and the beauty is hard to obtain again! The ancients said that what we cherish most is the past, and what we neglect the most is the present. How true, how true! Although, in the ten miles of foreign concessions, the scenery is boundless, what is there worth cherishing in the future? We should seize the present and not be negligent! "The green hills are still the customs of Yangzhou, and how many peaks cannot cross the river," here the material civilization is something that the green willow city walls cannot even dream of, but the vulgar and hateful scenery is suspected to be more than doubled than there. This poem can be borrowed to sing about it.</p>
<p>Jiangnan has long been known as a soul-stirring place, and the vulgar saying also uses paradise to describe Suzhou and Hangzhou, but in recent times, Shanghai has taken its place. In the past, Huang Xie and Lord Chunshen were small towns located in remote coastal areas, not scenic areas or places of gentle beauty. After the sea ban was lifted, foreign ships gathered like clouds. As a result, all kinds of undertakings flourished, people from all directions gathered, and it became the only major commercial port in the East. I once read a novel written by an Englishman, which was full of ridicule for the beauties: criticizing them for being vulgar, greedy, and lacking elegant bones; depicting the nouveau riche and the poor snobs, being vulgar, uncultured, mean, and ungrateful. The description was so vivid and the satire so sharp. At that time, I really wanted to give this description to the Shanghai men! Not only is it true of the people, but is it not also true of the place? There is no mountain or water, or beauty of bamboo and stone, not to mention the beautiful gardens and ponds here. What is rare to see is like phoenix feathers. Spring comes and spring goes, the so-called "good times and beautiful scenery, what a waste, whose house is the enjoyment" is like the spring breeze not passing through the Jade Gate Pass. What is revealed to us is only the silent passage of time. I once lamented: living in Shanghai for a long time is like being placed in the desert. There is no human habitation, and even the sound of footsteps is rare. Being isolated from the world, the vitality is exhausted. Not only are the famous gardens of Luoyang and the beautiful flowers of Heyang hard to come by, even more so than the heavenly peaches and the red apricots by the sun, even the wildflowers and the tired flying birds are hardly seen or heard all year round. Even white poplar withered grass, maple leaves and reed catkins are treasured as much as colorful flowers and plump beauties. Ninety years of youthful time have passed quickly, and spring never comes to the world. What can be gained and randomly guessed, and carefully experienced, is a common feeling, a different taste, as if still receiving the gift of the gurgling sound outside the curtains, the spring rain in the small building, and the east wind rain last night. Alas! This is Su Wu's life of lying on ice and snow in the northern border! Ten thousand kinds of worries, loneliness, who to tell, the pain can be imagined. The former Napoleon said that there are no difficult words in the dictionary, and I think there is no spring in the dictionary of Shanghai people!</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Returning from the Slums</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Summer is a terrible season when plague ghosts run rampant and diseases are rampant. As long as you are not careful in your daily diet and daily life, you will get sick. Therefore, at this time, those who want to maintain health and reduce danger should first pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene. Whether it is what you eat, use, wear, or how you move and rest, you must be careful at all times to reduce the chance of pain and disease entering.</p>
<p>Especially the poor who are struggling on the poverty line, their lives have no rules, their actions are often abnormal, and they lack hygiene knowledge even more. Therefore, according to newspaper records and statistics from health authorities, the number of deaths each summer is the highest among the poor. Therefore, I often think and hope that hygiene campaigns should be brought to the poor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Living a very prosperous life in the city, I can be said to be completely ignorant of the lives of those poor people who are excluded from the urban circle. Moreover, if we compare our lives with theirs, then I would suspect that I and they exist in two different worlds.</p>
<p>"How can we make their lives the same as ours?" Yesterday, after returning from an inspection of the slums, I suddenly had such a thought. But in the end, I myself admitted that my consciousness was wrong, because this is fundamentally impossible!</p>
<p>In these places, not to mention living, even if you ask me to stay for an hour or two, it is impossible. But yesterday, for the sake of my duties, I finally inspected there for as long as two hours, and I carefully analyzed every dirty corner.</p>
<p>There, there are no towering foreign buildings, no smooth asphalt roads, and no streamlined motorcycles. Here, there is only a group of poor people who have been forgotten by the people of the metropolis. — A shallow, narrow river surrounds a damp wasteland. Seventy or eighty short thatched cottages are squeezed unevenly on the wasteland. Some women and children are working leisurely or playing in the open space in front of the door or under the eaves of the thatched cottages. As for the structure of these thatched cottages, it is very ridiculous and simple. Many broken pottery jars and broken lead sheets discarded in the garbage heap can be used as their building materials. Some people even drag a broken sampan to the shore and consider it a house. Moreover, most of the thatched cottages are short and small. It really doesn't look like a house, but it looks a bit like a chicken coop or doghouse. There are no windows or back doors. If a fire breaks out, I really have to worry about them.</p>
<p>In the small river, there is only some filthy bottom water left. A foul odor often rises from the bottom of the river and spreads through the air with the wind. The surrounding open space also evaporates the smell of urine and feces, making me feel nauseous and want to vomit. Many mosquitoes and red-headed flies are practicing there without order, as if they were soldiers in a military camp. The water they drink is drawn from the deepest section of the small river, and they wash rice and other things there. The children are all naked, and the women either wear a vest, or a broken and dirty short shirt, or expose their upper body and only wear a bellyband. But they are all as dirty as a mud bodhisattva.</p>
<p>However, when I asked them, I was very surprised. Not only are they content with this kind of life, but they also have not expressed any dissatisfaction with this environment. Therefore, I realized that as long as a person can be content with their own real life, then they can be satisfied with any bad environment. On the contrary, even if they go to paradise, they will feel dissatisfied.</p>
<p>However, I feel that their unhygienic habits must be improved...</p>

<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>
<p>— Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of University of Pennsylvania, America</p>
<h3>We Should Treat Sexual Disorders Early</h3>
<p>The various evils caused by masturbation are truly countless. Neurasthenia and sexual disorders are the diseases most easily suffered by young people who have a habit of masturbation. However, people who lack sexual knowledge are most likely to make false judgments about the occurrence of this disease. Now we will describe some of these important matters and contribute them to modern young people! This is not to say that it is a matter that meets the needs.</p>
<p>Marriage is a major event in life, and marriage and sexual life are inseparable. Therefore, if you have stubborn and incurable gonorrhea before marriage, and you have signs of weakness and incomplete development due to masturbation, or premature ejaculation due to nocturnal emission, you should seek treatment quickly. If you still ignore it and enter married life, this is indeed very dangerous. Because it can deepen the degree of your sexual disorder, and the couple cannot achieve a complete union and cannot manage a satisfactory family. As a result, you feel depressed, leading to divorce. The wife suffers from hysteria as a result. In any case, there will always be irreconcilable elements between the couple. Understanding this level, you can know that a satisfactory family and a harmonious couple are completely built on the ability of both parties to be healthy and have a complete sexual life.</p>
<p>The function of sexual desire is controlled by complex mental actions. If there is any mental distress, it will immediately manifest as an obstacle to sexual function. Therefore, in addition to the main drug treatment, you should also pay attention to mental therapy. In other words, do not put too much thought into unimportant details.</p>
<p>Since the promotion of this disease is due to masturbation and gonorrhea in youth, and those who have been weak due to nocturnal emission for too long, then if this condition is discovered before marriage, you should quickly take "Reproductive Hormone" made of gonadal hormones to treat it, because the result of masturbation can deplete the source of gonadal hormones, so it will cause sexual disorders. If it is due to gonorrhea for too long, then the outbreak of this disease is also inevitable. The main countermeasure must be to take "Anti-Gonorrhea," a drug for treating gonorrhea made of yellow pigment and vaccine. At the same time, take "Mr. Smith's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to consolidate the semen and save nocturnal emission. This is the most fundamental and thorough treatment. If this disease breaks out after marriage, there is no need to hide it from your wife. You can frankly explain it to your wife. In addition to taking the above-mentioned effective and good medicines, you should abstain from sexual desire, because if the correction method is obtained with the joint cooperation of the couple, the effect will be more effective.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking for Men and Women</p>
<h3>Special Effective Method</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The patients are a Mr. and Mrs. Zhang. They both had an opium habit and had to consume five mace of opium every day. As a result, they were as thin as firewood, had no blood on their faces, and were mentally sluggish and had a sharp decline in appetite. In the spring of the year before last, they tried to quit smoking once, but because they were too deeply addicted, they experienced all kinds of illnesses when quitting and had to stop halfway. In March of this year, they were introduced by their relatives to use the cultivation and supplement smoking cessation method. After taking "Reproductive Hormone" for men and women, they were able to quit completely. At first, they only felt that the amount of smoking gradually decreased. After taking about three boxes, they saw the smoke and hated it, and eventually broke the addiction. According to them, there was absolutely no pain when quitting. It was truly a world apart from the last time they quit.</p>

<h3>Symptomatic Treatment of Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>The patient is 21 years old, from Changzhou, named Yu, lives at No. 90 Anyi Village, North Tibet Road, and works at a laundry company. In April of this year, he and a friend named Wang went whoring in the French Concession Beiler Road East China Public House. After that, the two of them suffered from leukorrhea at the same time. They received diagnoses and took medicine one after another, but they have not seen any effect. Due to taking inferior medicine by mistake, the acute became chronic. Gonorrheal threads sometimes seeped out of the urine, and the urethral opening was covered with white liquid, such that after a little labor during the day, he wanted to have nocturnal emission at night. At the same time, the amount of leukorrhea also increased extremely. Seeing this situation, the two of them were greatly frightened. Later, they were introduced by a friend to come to my clinic for treatment. In addition to correcting all of his improper behavior and teaching him methods of preserving life, I also guided him in a most stable self-treatment and root-cause cure method. He takes "Anti-Gonorrhea," a special drug for treating gonorrhea, three times a day, morning, noon, and night, using a large amount of boiled water to wash it down. Two tablets each time, because "Anti-Gonorrhea" is made with a combination of yellow pigment and vaccine, and is the most advanced drug for treating gonorrhea in modern times. Not only can it penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, but it also has the ability to increase resistance to gonococci. At the same time, because there was nocturnal emission, he was also given "Mr. Smith's Semen-Consolidating Pills." In this way, for two months, the leukorrhea and nocturnal emission were completely cured.</p>

<h3>Understanding and Practicing Aging Prevention</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dr. Yu Bofu from a German medical journal</p>
<p>...Both physical and mental aging must be considered... The decline of both body and mind, as well as the deterioration of the reproductive glands, are causes of aging... We must prevent aging based on scientific and medical principles.</p>
<p>To prevent aging, do not only pay attention to physical aging; mental aging is the foundation of aging. However, even if the body is aging, but the mind is still like that of a young person, it cannot be considered true health. Moreover, it is not uncommon for the mind to show extreme signs of aging. From this point of view, it is not appropriate to only focus on preventing mental aging, deviating from physiological aging. Truly successful people must be able to achieve both.</p>
<p>The cause of aging is greatly related to the activity of our body's cells. For longevity, the function of the heart and delaying aging are the most important factors. Overworking the body, mind, and all organs can greatly accelerate aging. Among the phenomena of aging, the most important is the function of the reproductive glands.</p>
<p>The reproductive glands are indeed closely related to our aging. Therefore, if we can keep the endocrine secretions of the reproductive glands permanently vigorous, then we can prevent aging. Because after the endocrine secretions are vigorous, they directly strengthen the testicles in men and eliminate obstacles in the ovaries of women. At this time, as Austrian physiologist Steinach said: taking the testicles or ovaries of animals and performing transplantation can rejuvenate. Therefore, taking reproductive gland extracts from strong animals to prevent aging is even more effective. Therefore, his method of advocating rejuvenation has been unanimously praised by scholars.</p>
<p>After the endocrine secretions of the reproductive glands are vigorous, they can allow all parts of the body to develop appropriately and fully, and can excrete toxic metabolic products from the body, helping the central nervous system and sensory organs eliminate fatigue. Proper blood circulation can reduce the pressure of physical and mental fatigue. Based on these strong scientific principles, Austrian physiologist Steinach invented the reproductive gland extract "Rejuvenation." Its efficacy can transfer the medicinal power from the reproductive glands to the blood, causing a tonic and antitoxic effect throughout the body, clearing the toxins absorbed from food in the intestinal wall. Therefore, it can keep us healthy and prolong life. It is also made into two types for men and women. We do not seek longevity unless we want to achieve this expectation. We must follow true scientific principles and medical principles to engage in this most meaningful and effective "Rejuvenation" remedy, breaking the saying "Seventy years is a rare age." Therefore, we should not treat longevity as merely a verbal game.</p>

<h3>Sincere Advice to Young Men with Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that nocturnal emission is caused by masturbation, and that nocturnal emission leads to harmful consequences. However, in reality, the degree of harm varies significantly depending on the severity of each individual's condition. In general, it is impossible to escape harming one's health, so you should give up your bad habit of masturbation to reduce your chances of nocturnal emission, so that you can protect the safety of your life.</p>
<p>If nocturnal emission is frequent and continuous, then what are the degrees of harm manifested? My answer is that there are the following three main conditions: (1) neurasthenia, (2) incomplete development of reproductive organs, and (3) systemic disorders.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is almost an inevitable symptom after frequent nocturnal emissions. For example, the mind is unclear, leading to heaviness of the head, headache, poor memory, and other emotional disturbances and easy fatigue, weariness, and lack of courage in general. If nocturnal emission or even spermatorrhea occurs during the development stage, the development of the reproductive organs may be stopped. At the same time, many organs, such as the testicles and prostate, are also prevented from developing. In addition, the more severe of those who cause systemic disorders will gradually lead to the body becoming thin, and the complexion will gradually become significantly poor. Therefore, the treatment of nocturnal emission really cannot be delayed any longer. Now that medicine is advanced, everything should be based on fundamental treatment, and the method of strengthening the seminal vesicle is the most effective solution. At this time, the patient should take "Hemetol Sperm Consolidation Pills," which is an effective and recognized good medicine based on our many years of experimentation. If "Rejuvenation" is taken at the same time, the above three conditions caused by nocturnal emission can be quickly cured.</p>
<p>Common Sense on Bone Pain</p>
<h3>The Course of Curing Two Types of Bone Pain Sufferers</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>A good mirror for those with the same disease... Can be a reference for others... There are many reasons for bone pain... Choosing medicine must be careful.</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Jingming was once a strong and healthy young man. After contracting venereal disease once at the age of 22, although he was cured five years ago, he still felt severe soreness between his blood and knee joints. Sometimes when he did not get enough sleep, or worked a little too hard, or walked for too long, he would have lower back pain, and the pain would gradually spread from the left side to the right side, or from the upper body to the lower body, which was extremely painful. Although Mr. Zhang had taken medicine to recuperate or control his workload to alleviate the pain, because the medicine was not suitable for his condition, he had not been completely cured until now. The condition was sometimes mild and sometimes severe, causing great mental distress, and he was worried that it would get worse and worse. Later, after being introduced by his relative to take "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills," his condition improved. At first, the soreness in his shoulders and knee joints gradually lessened. After taking three boxes, the soreness disappeared completely. Even if he worked a little too hard or walked for too long, he did not feel the pain as he had before.</p>
<p>Another patient, Lu Gengsheng, was 52 years old. Because of his old age and weakness, he suffered from bone pain. However, his condition would worsen significantly every time the seasons changed. Usually, he only felt slight soreness throughout his body. When the condition worsened, his hands and feet felt like they were carrying heavy objects, and he could not move. Last spring, after being introduced by a fellow sufferer, he also took "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills." He stopped treatment after taking about four boxes. Now, it has been more than a year, and he has never had another episode.</p>

<p>(1) The Relationship between Impotence and Offspring</p>
<p>The patient, surnamed Xu, is 32 years old and from Wudian, Zhejiang Province. He has been doing business in Shanghai for 13 years. He lives in Yongkang Lane, Alabaster Road, north of the New Rubbish Bridge in this port. (Chief Complaint) — He has had a feeling of heaviness and discomfort near the anus for many years. It has worsened since he got married at the age of 28, and there is a sticky substance after urination. His erectile strength is extremely weak, and his libido is very low. He has been married for five years and still has no offspring. Although he has not masturbated since marriage, nocturnal emission is unavoidable. (Symptoms at the time of treatment) — Both sides of the prostate are swollen like pigeon eggs, and there is a feeling of tenderness to the touch. The urine contains prostatic fluid, and there is also a high degree of neurasthenia. (Treatment Method) — Cooling the prostate, performing effective massage, and taking "Rejuvenation" three times a day, two tablets each time, to fundamentally cure his neurasthenia. At the same time, taking "Hemetol Sperm Consolidation Pills" and injecting "Yuwei Cibaoming" twice a week. In addition, electrical therapy was administered in the morning and evening. After two weeks of treatment, all symptoms improved immediately. After an excellent course, the prostate shrunk to normal size in about a month. All symptoms, neurasthenia, and nocturnal emission were completely eliminated, and normal health was restored. He only took about three or five boxes of "Hemetol Sperm Consolidation Pills" and "Rejuvenation" in total, and half a dozen injections of "Yuwei Cibaoming." Recently, Mr. Xu came to the clinic and said that his wife was already three months pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) Incomplete Development of Reproductive Organs</p>
<p>The patient, Xi Zhongmin, is 21 years old and lives at No. 4 Tongxing Lane, Kaifeng Road, in this port. His occupation is unknown. (Chief Complaint) — The reproductive organs are short and small, and he has phimosis. He had used a vacuum therapy device for half a year, but to no avail. (Current Symptoms) — The penis is as big as a little finger, and the testicles and prostate are also abnormally small, and he has third-degree phimosis. He was accompanied by his relative Mr. Zha for diagnosis and treatment in the winter of last year. (Treatment Method) — Dr. Zhan performed phimosis surgery, which took only 15 minutes, and there was no pain. He took "Rejuvenation" internally, injected "Yuwei Cibaoming," and applied gas therapy. A special and effective massage was applied to the prostate area. After about half a month, the development gradually progressed, but it was not yet satisfactory. Later, after taking about five boxes of "Rejuvenation," the development was completed, and everything was very satisfactory. The most obvious thing was that the sexual organs were enlarged more than twice their original size, and the pubic hair also grew densely and rapidly.</p>
<p>Famous Medicine Experiment</p>
<p>Intoxicated with Fitness</p>
<p>In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China, I suffered a serious illness for three months and was greatly injured. At that time, I was in the developmental stage. After the illness, my muscles became thin and emaciated, forming a state of withered blood and weakness. My hair fell out, my menstruation was irregular, my appetite was greatly reduced, and my weight was only 80 pounds. My chest circumference was small, and my breasts were atrophied, without any beautiful shape. I tried various tonics, but they were of little use. It was not until last winter that I started taking "Rejuvenation" for women, and my condition gradually improved. At first, my appetite increased, and I became more energetic. After taking two boxes, my face became fuller, and my muscles gradually became stronger. The most significant thing was that my weight increased by eight pounds. I believe that "Rejuvenation" is the most effective preparation, so I take it regularly with peace of mind. Now, it has been ten months, and I have always been full of energy. My breasts have developed plumply, and I have completely achieved the typical feminine beauty. (Shen Jianzhen)</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Nicotine Addiction</p>
<p>Sir: Since my husband passed away, I have been overly anxious and restless, so I became addicted to nicotine. After using "Leukorrhea Cure," I was completely cured. However, the bad habit of nicotine addiction is very difficult to quit. May I ask what medicine is most effective for quitting nicotine quickly and without pain? (Asked by Chen Fengmei)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can take "Rejuvenation" for women to quit nicotine addiction. At the same time, injecting "Yuwei Cibaoming" can shorten the smoking cessation period by about one-third. We guarantee that there will be no pain during quitting.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain and Weakness</p>
<p>Since I got married, my body has never been strong and healthy. On the contrary, I have become much thinner than before marriage. Especially, I often have stomach pain, and my digestion is poor. Therefore, I can only eat up to one and a half bowls of rice per meal. Sometimes when the pain occurs, I do not even eat. After taking "Stomach Pain Cure" and "Stomachic" this spring, my stomach pain was cured, and my appetite also increased greatly. Therefore, my body is strong and healthy, and my complexion is unusually rosy. (Yan Huaqiang)</p>

<h3>A Further Step in Mass Tuberculosis Screening</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city, with the assistance of the Municipal Health Bureau and the Tuberculosis Prevention Association, will hold a mass X-ray tuberculosis screening starting on the 11th of this month. To check whether you have tuberculosis, you only need to spend one dollar to purchase a ticket and go for the examination. The price of retrieving the examination photo is also particularly low. An X-ray examination in an ordinary hospital costs no less than ten dollars, and the highest price is several tens of dollars. This mass examination only costs one dollar, which is extremely low. This is truly a blessing for the citizens.</p>
<p>However, we still have one opinion. If the examination proves that there is indeed tuberculosis, what should be done for further treatment? This is not a problem for those with ample means. They have every way to quietly recuperate. But for the general public, whose lives depend on daily work, even if they know they have tuberculosis, how can they treat it? We know that people with lung disease are not necessarily those with ample means. On the contrary, those who are less well-off are more likely to suffer from lung disease. These poor people have already known from experience that they may have suspected lung disease, but because they have no money or time to treat it, they have to "leave it to fate." The disease gets worse day by day, but they still have to work. For people like this, even if there is a very low-cost opportunity for lung disease examination now, what will they do if they know they have lung disease? Therefore, we believe that it is not enough to just provide the general public with the opportunity to check for lung disease at any time at a low price. It does not mean that those suffering from lung disease can be saved. On the contrary, it only makes people know, adding infinite sorrow to them. This is indeed possible.</p>
<p>I do not have any doubts about this grand mass lung disease screening. On the contrary, we absolutely agree that this grand event is for the benefit of the general public. However, I also believe that in addition to providing low-cost examinations for citizens, it is best to take a further step and establish low-cost tuberculosis sanatoriums, or even free ones, so that the poor and needy can have a chance to be saved even if they suffer from lung disease. Only in this way can this mass screening be the most meaningful move.</p>
<p>We give the greatest praise to the Municipal Health Bureau and others for jointly organizing this mass tuberculosis screening. At the same time, we hope that after the screening, there will be even more meaningful events to further benefit the citizens.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Melon</h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>These past few days of rain, it is said that the "wind wings" of the hurricane have passed through Shanghai, so we have eaten a lot of cheap watermelons. Yesterday, when the melon seller passed through the alley, it was still two small foreign coins each. Last night's wind dropped the price of melons to one small foreign coin each. I believe that if the weather does not turn hot, it will probably drop further. Speaking of this, I remembered a melon story from a few years ago.</p>
<p>At that time, I was living in the countryside. The melon garden next door belonged to my uncle from the same clan. He was a kind old man, and he treated us very well, taking care of us all day long: Don't steal melons, everyone will get a big slice when the melons are ripe in a few days. But we naughty children didn't listen to him. On a hazy moonlit night, we quietly went to the melon shed and picked one. Because we were still ignorant and naughty children, we were not very familiar with the nature of the melons. We accidentally picked one that was not yet ripe. When we ate it, it tasted a little sour. In a fit of anger, we threw the melon into the small river, and we mumbled and complained about our uncle, who was old and muddled and didn't grow sweet melons.</p>
<p>The next day, we heard our uncle scolding. He said angrily:</p>
<p>"You unconscionable melon thieves, you even steal the melons that I haven't even ripened yet, × your mother's rotten stuff!"</p>
<p>We felt as if we had been stung, and our hearts were filled with shame, but we still didn't dare to admit that we had done it. I still feel a little guilty about this matter.</p>
<p>The worst thing was that the old man not only didn't suspect us at all, but also told us very seriously when he finished telling us stories in the evening:</p>
<p>"When you grow up, don't be like this melon thief. You have no conscience! You pick it and it's not tasty, but you ruin other people's seeds. Isn't that bad for both sides?"</p>
<p>Hearing this kind of tone from this old man, even though we didn't understand anything, we almost cried. Especially, my heart was so sad that I wanted to tell the whole story. But in the end, we didn't confess to this poor old man, and this matter was buried in our little hearts.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. The melons under the melon shed grew slowly. We watched our uncle call three brothers from the same clan to help him pick off some of the not very full and weak melons and carry them to the market in yokes to sell them to those who often went to the provincial city to sell "watermelon pickles." That night, the moonlight was very good, and we were sitting under the banyan tree enjoying the cool. The wrinkled face of our uncle was glowing with a soft light that we had never seen before.</p>
<p>After a while, he knocked off the ashes from his pipe and slowly said to us again (whatever he had in his heart, he would tell us a complete story).</p>
<p>"We're in luck this year. You say: watermelon pickles can also be sold at such a high price, so why worry about the melon cloth?"</p>
<p>He raised his head and smiled at the star-filled moonlit sky that had no rain clouds.</p>
<p>"Now they are eight-ripe. Just pass five days, - no: it's best to pass a few more days, so the melon will grow fat and big, and then we won't have to worry for half a year. What debt, tax, donation, nothing matters."</p>
<p>We didn't understand his words very much at that time, but we knew his happiness very well.</p>
<p>So, we sometimes went to the melon shed and stared at the melon with our eyes wide open, watching it grow fatter day by day. Later, the melons grew too heavy, and the melon shed seemed to be about to collapse. Our uncle put a lot of effort into tying the remaining "long melons" with bamboo cages to the melon shed, so that the poor melon shed would bear less weight.</p>
<p>The melons were all ripe. Old Wang, who often carried the melons to the market to sell them, told our uncle these days that it was time for the melons to be on the market, and that they shouldn't be too ripe or they wouldn't be sold. The stubborn uncle didn't listen to him. According to his experience, if he waited another day or two, the melons would definitely be sweeter and fuller. He, an old man, believed that this was never wrong.</p>
<p>However, this time it was beyond his expectations.</p>
<p>One day, the weather changed. In the evening, a storm swept in, and the rain followed, blowing and hitting the ground non-stop. The rain was so noisy that I couldn't sleep, and I spent a bored day at home with annoyance.</p>
<p>Finally, the rain stopped on the morning of the fifth day. I walked out early in the morning, and I was really surprised when I passed my uncle's melon shed. How come the melon shed had completely collapsed and the fat melons were crushed? So, I walked into the melon garden. Suddenly, it was as if I had stepped on something, and I was startled. When I saw that it was a person with protruding eyes lying there drenched in the rain, I screamed and walked out.</p>
<p>After coming out, I, who had always been timid, never talked to anyone about this matter.</p>
<p>Later, the village spread the word! My uncle had passed away.</p>
<p>Chen Junyang, named Yi Tong, is a famous modern seal carver, the younger brother of Ju Lai, and also a student of Mr. Zhao Shuru of Siming. He is assiduous in his studies, loves antiquity, and also engages in seal carving. He follows the Qin and Han dynasties, and his style is vigorous, lofty, and profound, in harmony with ancient meaning. Compared to those who imitate dilapidated styles and think of themselves as lofty and ancient, his style is very different. We reveal his recent works to show them to those who appreciate them.

<h3>Labor-Inducing Injection</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>All kinds of medicine bottles were disorderly arranged on the table. A pair of small scissors and a clamp were especially sensitive to me. I wonder if my wife was lying on her back on the bed and saw me? She often mentioned these shiny iron instruments to me, and even said with a shudder: What if I have a difficult labor and have to use a knife? I always used comforting words to dispel her fears. At this time, I only hoped that she had her eyes closed. It was simply unreasonable to ask the female doctor not to take out the knife, clamp, and iron hook, unless we didn't ask them to come.</p>
<p>The narrow room was like a steamer in the summer. The stagnant air was filled with the smell of mineral medicines and my wife's intermittent moans. My wife's mother had prepared sweaters, skirts, warm water, bitter herb soup... everything, and was sitting next to the bed, murmuring prayers from time to time: "I hope my daughter will have a quick and easy birth... The child will come out quickly and wear new clothes..." The voice was restricted so low because she knew that I did not believe in gods and Buddhas. Two young female doctors were sitting by the window, fanning themselves and talking about idle things that had nothing to do with my wife's childbirth.</p>
<p>"Is it very painful now? Does it feel like you need to defecate?..." Sometimes, the older female doctor would turn her head and ask my wife once or twice, but my wife always shook her head slightly.</p>
<p>This made me anxious. I took out my watch several times. The doctor had been here for about two hours. I knew from the hospital regulations that the limit was four hours, and two dollars had to be added for each hour after that. It was common for childbirth to be delayed all day and all night, so how could we afford it? The more I thought about it, the more anxious I became. The doctor was still chatting leisurely, sometimes looking at the furniture in my room and the photo frames on the wall. At this time, my only hope was that my wife would shout loudly in pain, because urgent pain was the precursor to labor. I had learned this experience from the doctor. But how could I bear to see my wife suffer such severe pain! My wife's moan almost burst out from my heart... However, because of economic hardship... I had to have this contradictory hope. So, I looked at my watch again.</p>
<p>The female doctor, without waiting for me to speak, warned me as if to give me a warning: "I'm afraid it's going to be a difficult birth?"</p>
<p>"Difficult birth!" My wife turned her distressed face over: "Do... do... do I have to have surgery... I... I... can't stand it..." She stared at me with frightened and suspicious eyes. The female doctor laughed and explained to me:</p>
<p>"Her pain nerves are weak... She should be injected with a labor-inducing injection, four dollars per injection!"</p>
<p>Most of what she said were specialized terms in physiology and medicine. The only three sentences I could hear clearly were these. Four dollars per injection, wouldn't this extra expense exceed our budget again? Although we wouldn't be unable to pay this injection fee right now, the expenses after childbirth were constantly pouring in. My wife's dream of finding a job after childbirth had been completely shattered. Since my wife became pregnant, the relatives and friends who could help us had done their best. From now on, we would have to rely on our own weak sweat and strength to support this family that had added a member... Thinking about it, I expressed my opinion:</p>
<p>"Let's wait another half an hour. If there's no movement, then please give her the labor-inducing injection... But can the fee be reduced a little? I've already paid five dollars for the delivery."</p>
<p>"That's impossible. Our regulations are like this. Do you still cherish money when giving birth to a child!" They cast a pitying but somewhat disdainful glance at my wife. I squeezed my watch in my hand, as if I was squeezing my own heart. My wife was suffering from the torment of pain every minute. She frowned, she groaned, and she finally told her mother to ask the female doctor to give her the injection. She couldn't stand the pain any longer. My heart was also throbbing with pain. I bit my lip: "Okay, give her the labor-inducing injection." The female doctor happily prepared everything. In order to reduce my wife's suffering, I had to endure a little mental pain. Perhaps, it was necessary for me to endure this mental pain permanently, for the sake of future life, for the sake of future days...</p>
<h3>Anticipation</h3>
<p>— Already</p>
<p>For days, they had been anticipating the arrival of an unknowable hope. This hope was as if a hungry person sought food, or a desperate person prayed for divine help, it was so faint. However, living in hardship, they were sufficiently comforted for the moment by this hope. Every day, they dreamed, "If there were news saying I was accepted, how happy would I feel!"</p>
<p>But things often don't go as desired. The more eagerly they anticipated, the more disappointed they became. The postman came several times each day, but there was not a single letter for them. Yet, they did not abandon the hope they harbored in their hearts. Even after each disappointment, hope seemed even closer to realization, swirling in their minds. Because time passed quickly, they were getting closer to the hoped-for outcome.</p>
<p>"Why rush? It's only been three days; they probably haven't even looked at the exam papers yet." Initially, they always comforted themselves this way. They confidently predicted that it would take at least a week to mark the papers clearly. And after marking, they would need to make another decision on who to select. Recently, employers have been very cautious, and wouldn't act rashly. By the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, they each indulged in fantasies: "Maybe there will be a registered letter tomorrow?" But still, there was no news. Several "tomorrows" passed silently and without a sound.</p>
<p>At this point, they had to become anxious, even if they didn't want to! "How confident are you about your answers?" "That's hard to say. The composition is probably not bad; I wrote over two thousand words, and I was satisfied with it when I read it. But history and geography are a bit difficult; I only answered two-thirds of the twenty-odd questions, and some of them might be wrong. English was simple enough, passable. I forgot three or four words in one translation, but I don't think it will matter." "But there are so many applicants, seventy or eighty, and they're only taking two, passing might be difficult..." "That's for sure. Fifty dollars a month, who wouldn't compete for this job? I heard that those who took the exam that day had already been selected from a large pool; they received over six hundred letters of inquiry."</p>
<p>Thinking of the fifty-dollar reward, they really wished they could snatch the position immediately. Because they had been unemployed for so long, their desire for work was more urgent than others. But they couldn't do that; the only way was to leave it to fate. If they were lucky enough to be accepted, they would have temporary relief and wouldn't starve. If they were unlucky and failed, they would cry out in misery! The days ahead would be truly unmanageable; they had been living in poverty for months. However, after enduring many "winters," they said generously, "Forget it. If I fail, let others do it. The pain of unemployment is the same for everyone. We want to work, and of course, others want to work too."</p>

<p>Opening: "Gold and Beauty"</p>
<p>What in this world easily moves the heart? Only gold and beauty. Gold can seize the ambition of a common man. The words of a beauty are like an imperial edict. Look, how many young people suffer hardship, all for gold and beauty. Remember, the hero Xiang Yu committed suicide at the Wujiang River. He was, reluctantly parting with his beauty, Yu Ji. Look, how corrupt officials fight for power and position. They are constantly thinking of gold. Some, for gold, brothers quarrel. Some, for wealth, murder and commit evil deeds. Some, for gold, loved ones become enemies. Some, for gold, husbands and wives are separated. Some, for gold, instantly lose their conscience. Some, for gold, lose their honor and body. Gold, I think you are, the supreme authority wreaking havoc. I don't know how many people you have harmed. I see you, overturning right and wrong with great power. Therefore, gold can buy a beauty's heart. Look, from ancient times, beauties have had great power, not only captivating the country but also the city. Remember, in the "Three Smiles" story, Tang Jieyuan yearns for a beauty with tender affection. Shuangzhufeng's Wen Bizheng sells himself to the high official's family. Doing the same, scholars don't want to study, willing to be lowly people. Don't laugh, don't look down on them. Why not be fond of beauty? Beauty, hateful you, bullying people with power and influence. Hateful you, only valuing clothes and not people. For you, compatriots and brothers have different opinions. For you, fathers and sons actually argue. I think, if there were no such thing as you in the world, bandits would not run rampant. If there were no such thing as you in the world, not only could the country be strengthened, but also the body. If there were no such thing as you in the world, what inheritance would be fought over, what lives would be harmed? If there were no such thing as you in the world, good families would not have revolutions. All because of him, the dazzling gold blinds people's eyes. All because of you, playing as a beauty, arousing greed. Look, nine out of ten men are greedy for lust. Women have always loved gold and silver. Therefore, deceiving and loving each other, gold and silver. How many heroes die for whom? Countless live for you. Making trouble and teasing people.</p>

<h3>Chen Jiazhen's Grand Funeral Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Zhier</p>
<p>A funeral without female weeping Extremely miserable Will discuss burial issues Insufficient funds</p>
<p>Chen Jiazhen is dead!</p>
<p>His photography skills during his lifetime were praised by his peers, but he did not use them properly. He was once active in the film industry, and almost all of the covers and bathing suit photos of various film magazines were provided by him. He also compiled the Eight Great Stars collection, but his talent did not benefit the Chinese film industry in any way. If anything, it only made fans more infatuated with female stars, and further developed the distorted star system in a more distorted way.</p>
<p>However, his character and his treatment of friends were known for their honesty and sincerity. He always greeted people with a sincere smile, shaking hands firmly, and speaking without any slickness. From his Shaoxing-accented speech, one could immediately feel his sincerity.</p>
<p>Precisely because of his honesty and sincerity, he was deceived by two female stars (we are not feudal in saying that Yuan Diao must love Jia Gong, but using him, deceiving him with false love to elevate one's own position, this is always an ironclad fact). Because of this, his lung disease worsened, and he died suddenly at the age of only twenty-four.</p>
<p>After his death, the situation was very miserable. The words "desolate after death" are the most accurate description. As for the situation and the process, the newspapers have already recorded it, so I will omit it here. Now I just want to tell you some details of his grand funeral.</p>
<p>The mourning hall was very quiet, and very few friends arrived. Apart from a few friends from the New Fourth Circle, it could be said that there was almost no one. Among these fewer than twenty friends, this funeral without female weeping quietly let time slip by.</p>
<p>At 11:30, the grand funeral began. The fewer than twenty friends circled the coffin once, paying their last respects to him before the coffin was closed. Then, a very simple and unadorned memorial ceremony was held, presided over by Wu Liande, who offered three incense sticks and three libations. Then, the funeral procession immediately set off, and the coffin is now temporarily placed in Yongxi Hall (Shaoxing Guild Hall).</p>
<p>In terms of funeral gifts, Wu Liande, Hu Die, and Pan Yousheng jointly sent a white lotus flower basket; the Sanhe Publishing House sent a wreath; cash gifts included: Liangyou Company one hundred yuan, Hu Die and Pan Yousheng read out the yuan, Yuan Shude ten yuan, Yuan Meiyun ten yuan (this was brought by Yuan Shude, but the envelope was written with "Yuan Meiyun's mother"). There were also several other ten yuan gifts, and Gao Jilin, Cui Wanqiu, Tang Na, Tang Yu, etc., each gave two yuan.</p>
<p>The female stars whose photos Chen Jiazhen had taken a lot of during his lifetime, none of them came, nor were there any "funeral gifts." This made people think of the old saying that people matter when they are alive, and human relationships are as thin as paper. A friend said that if Chen Jiazhen had taken them somewhere with his camera equipment to take pictures, they would definitely have followed. But unfortunately, Jiazhen is dead.</p>
<p>Attached is a message: Yuan Meiyun performed "Empress He Scolds the Court" on stage at Yan Mansion's private performance last night (the 17th). As for Diao Gong Ban Hua, she is said to be in Suzhou. At the same time, Ke Ni "er," the former "Daily Film" "film critic" who had never even sat on her bed, is also said to be in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Finally, a message was received from Chen Jiazhen's funeral committee that Ma Guoliang, Lin Zecang, Cui Wanqiu, Jiang Donglai, and Zhong Xinru have been appointed as funeral committee members. They will hold one or two meetings to discuss burial issues. Furthermore, the funds are still greatly insufficient. The mailing address is on the second floor of No. 138 Nanjing Road. If friends have any donations, they can send them directly to that address to obtain a receipt. All accounts will also be published successively.</p>
