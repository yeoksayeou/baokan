<h3 id="c5">論法國強化國防 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>法國是要用强化國防作為手段來貫澈它的和平志願的。這就是法國國防部長達拉第日前在卜賽、納省急進社會黨大會那一番演說的本意。他說。「我們必須使別國人民大家知道我們法國已經决定用一切方法使我國受到別人的尊重。……現在鄰邦已經實行工業動員了。如果有人還以為法國不應有組織國防的權利。甚且不應有組織的義務。這種人一定不是誠實的人。」這番話該可以博得國際公平人士的同情罷。因為法國强化國防是有着充分的理由的。第一·現世界的侵略集團已經旗幟鮮明了。法國是和平集團的主要國家。它把軍備强化起來。卽使不能壓抑侵略國家的氣燄。至少也可以延緩大戰的危機。第二·法國今日最所恐懼的是德國的報復式的侵略。德國重整軍備以後。單在陸軍方面。就已有常備軍三十五師。後備軍五十師了。現在法國的陸軍軍額是五十三萬人。只有德國陸軍軍額的三分之二。法國政府要使全國人民感到國境的安全。非把軍備充實到足以單獨抵禦德國侵略的程度不可。第三·歐洲的小國雖然都要維護國際的安全與和平。但是當國際侵略主義勢力抬頭的時候。却也有許多很容易給侵略集團裏脅了去。法國如果不從增强國力着想。恐怕連原有那些關係密切的與國。如小恊約國等。也要維繋不住了。</p>
<p>我們深信法國的和平志願是出於眞誠的。法國在上次大戰時期。有全國八分之一人口所居住的國土做了戰塲。它所遭受的物質的生命的損失是難以估計的。它從最後的勝利所得到的結果是什麽呢。無非是較戰前更多的煩惱和憂慮罷了。這樣深刻的敎訓難道還不够使法國厭惡戰爭麽。現在法國把軍備擴張起來。顯然是出於不得已的。我們不能不承認它那强化國防的政策為的是和平。不是戰爭。</p>
<p>我們中國人同法國人一樣。愛好着和平。我們中國也同法國一樣。受着侵略主義者的威脅。法國為國際的和平與本身的安全。所作的一切打算無論如何是値得我們參照的。達拉第在他的演詞中。最後有一句警語道。「我們應有的職責。就是使法國成為自由公民之祖國。而不至於成為奴隸之祖國。」我們對於自己的祖國不也應有同樣的信念麽。我們知道法國戰後的領土還未受過實際的侵略。而且它受侵略威脅的程度也遠不及我們這樣的深烈。法國入為要應付不測的禍變。尙且那麽興奮地作着未雨綢繆的準備。那麽我們應當怎樣的淬厲奮發才好啊。</p>

<p>…北平各校聯合舉行…　（北平特信）</p>
<p>北平當局、鑑於成都、北海兩事伴之先後勃發、對於「九·一八」之戒備辦法、早已下有明令、且北平地位特殊、外僑麕集、一遇機會、由對方趁機造成類似上述兩事件之糾紛、以便達到某種特殊目的、亦未嘗不可能、是以對於「九·一八」五週年紀念日、此間各當局、尤具慄慄危懼之感、是日除出動大批軍警、分住各校、嚴禁出外遊行外、並於全巿各通衢、配置軍警、以防不測、而最堪玩味者、凡遇「友邦」人士卜居之處、附近均駐有軍警多人、武裝整齊、如臨大敵、保護週密、防備恭嚴、此中滋味之是苦是辣、凡屬我國同胞、似均有回味之必要、記者於早晨六時出外巡視、晚八時始回、雖觸目驚心之象、比比皆是、但全市各處、均皆平安渡過、毫無糾紛、各學校學生、亦均於重壓悽愴　之空氣下、作其沉痛之回憶、並無其他行動、除少數學校、各別在校內舉行紀念會外、是日下午三時許、全巿各大·中·小·學校、並於端王府夾道某學院、聯合舉行紀念會、此為平市是日唯一可記之、紀念會矣、茲略誌其前後情形於次、</p>
<p>（一）會前　一入端王府　夾道附近區域、立覺嚴重之氛圍、壓人欲遁、而細一尋覓、始知此係軍警密集、偵探來往如穿梭、以及刺刀映日晶晶然等等　現象使然、會址所在之某學院門前、情形尤覺嚴重、但記者目覩各校代表、以及自動參加之男女學生、絡釋不絕、由四面八方、源源而來、尤值注目者、厥為彼等之態度、旣非萎靡不振、眉頭深鎖、亦非激昻衝動、興奮而前、其一種揚揚如平常、而又彷彿認定本身之使命、勇敢前進之態度、眞令人威動不置、</p>
<p>至三時左右、到各校代表及自動參加學生、共的六百餘人、而預定敦請講演之敎授陶希聖　臨時因故未能到塲、到者為張東蓀及吳覺先二人、並有新近由東三省　義勇軍中剛到北平之某君、趕來參加、允為令人注目、在會前半小時內、軍警方面、因見參加者頗為踴躍、恐開會時別生枝節、欲阻止開會、幸該院某院長、向軍警竭力擔保、據聞軍警方面、曾以「萬一生出意外、何人負責」等語向某院長責詰、某院長則以「由我一人負責」相答、是以紀念會之能得開成者、某院長同情援助之功、亦不可沒、以與隣近某師範學校校長、於十七日晚、卽嚴閉校門、並請來大批軍警、排立鐵柵欄門內、日夜持槍向外作待機狀者、其賢與不肯、相去眞不可以道里計也、</p>

<p>開會前數分鐘、有某平民學校男生一人及女生二人、自動於衆目睽睽下、於人叢中、高唱「打回老家去」「救亡進行曲」等歌、而音調蒼老、氣概雄壯、記者初聽下、尙以為出諸多數成年者之口、而細一觀看、始知不過為衣服襤褸、營養不足、十二三歲左右之男童一人　及女童二人而已、為之驚訝敬服不置、</p>
<p>紀念會之程序、異常簡單、主席報告後、卽請新由東北義勇軍中來　平之某君登台報吿、此君容顏顦顇、惟精神異常抖搜、一望而知係作　艱苦奮鬥之愛國志士、彼於熟烈之鼓掌聲中登台、對東北義勇軍折况報吿頗詳、有許多為外間不易得知者、爰記其大意於次、</p>

<p>議案通過之後、已屆六時左右、乃宣佈散會、此間當局、為策萬全計、於十九日繼續戒備一日、此亦可謂為「九一八」之餘波、</p>

<h3 id="c79">保險業　呈立法院　籲請免徵所得稅　援照歐美先例　提出理由三點 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>申時社云、本巿保險業同業公會、以所得稅暫行條例施行在卽、而以該條例中對於保　險費與保險金未經明白規定、准予免納所得稅、前日特陳明理由、呈請立法　院請予修正、規定人壽保　險及各種保險之保險費　與保險金免徵所得稅、以示獎掖、茲探錄其籲請理由如下、</p>
<p>理由三點</p>
<p>（一）査暫行條例第二條第一項、不以營利為目的之法人所得、免納所得稅、按投保人壽保險者、非以營利為目的、受益者縱是個人、而於一切重要問題、如貧窮·衰老·依賴·疾病·失業·失學·慈善·等、莫不仰賴人壽保險為之解决、是則人壽保險所得與　不以營利為目的之法人所得、論其性質、在社會所盡之功能、實無異致、此人壽保險應予免徵所得稅之理由一也、（一）査暫行　條例同條第二項、第二類所得、（卯）凡殘廢勞工、及無力生活者之撫恤金·養老金·及膽養金·免納所得稅、而人壽保險對（卯）種所列各事、實包括無遺、何以一般之撫恤金·養老金·及贍養金、可以免稅、乃對於用以為　撫恤養老贍養之保險金、及預備為撫恤養老贍養之保險費、獨不以明文　規定之於免稅之列乎、此人壽保險應予免徵所得稅之理由二也、（三）査暫行條例同條第三項、第三類所得、（丑）公務員及勞工之法定儲蓄金、免納所得稅、此種規定、推其用意、無非欲獎勵節儉、使其實行儲蓄、以備不虞而已、公務員之法定儲蓄、旣予獎勵、得享免稅待遇、而一般國民用以儲備不虞之保險費、則不酌予免稅、以資獎勵、同是國民、何厚於彼而薄於此乎、此人壽保險應予免徵所得稅之理由三也、</p>
<p>歐美先例</p>
<p>歐美各國、對人壽保險及各種保險、俱有免徵所得稅之先例、或免徵保險費、或免徵保險金或全部豁免、或酌予限制、要皆斟酌國情、而定免徵之範圍、如（一）美國、依照美國現　行所得稅法第二一三段乙第一二·六欽之規定、下列各項得免徵所得稅、甲、因死亡而受領之入壽保險金、乙、因保險滿期而　受領之儲蓄保險金或年金、但其所得超過總共所付保險費時、則就超過額徵收所得稅、丙、因傷害而受領之勞工賠償金、或意外及健康保險金、（二）英國、依照英國所得稅法、下列各項、得免徵所得稅、甲、凡納稅人每年所得在千鎊以下、所付之保險費、不超過稅額百分之十五者、乙、凡終身保險所付之保險費、不超過保　險金額百份之七者、丙、凡納稅人或其妻之延期年金保險費、不超過英金百鎊者、丁、凡保險費總額　不超過所得六份之一者、（三）日本、依照日本現　行所得稅出第十六條第三項六、有「以自己或家族　或繼承人為保險金受益　人締結人壽保險契的時、其保險費之繳納以年額二百元為限、依本人之聲請、得由所得內扣除之、不徵所得稅」之規定、（四）德國、依照德國現行所得稅法、各種保險之保險費、皆免徵所得稅、但以八千馬克為限、（五）法國、法國曾於一九二五年之預算表內、規定徵收極微之保險費稅、每千法郞徵收·〇一生丁、今則人壽保　險費得免徵所得稅矣、</p>

<p>上海防止霍　亂臨時事務所公吿第三號、錄誌如下、想為關心全國民衆衛生者、所樂聞也、</p>
<p>（一）自上次公吿發表後、已二月有餘、在此時間內、對於各醫院所收容之患腸胃病人、曾予嚴密注意、但本埠及其他各港、均無眞性霍亂發生、本年似不致有流行、</p>
<p>（二）有許多衛生專家推測本年為霍亂年、迄今幸未發生、因此或可謂四年來無霍亂、（除二十三年曾有散發性數例）能有如是良好結果、實因民衆對於衛生、巳知注意、自來水供給較為普遍、各市政當局及衛生機關宣傳防範得力、各鄰近區域病症减少、及施行普遍抗霍亂注射、</p>
<p>（三）此外尙有兩點、吾人須為述及、（甲）各方合作及衛生宣傳之重要、（乙）上海為霍亂病區　觀念之捐除、</p>
<p>（四）由化騐窒之檢査、可明人類帶菌者、對於霍亂傳播、幷不佔重要、反之、於傷寒一症、健康帶菌者、最為危險、</p>
<p>（五）民國二十四年與二十五年之夏季、溫度甚高、（最高至華氏一〇〇·八度）濕度亦甚高、至於二十三年之夏季、溫度竟高至一〇四·四度、而濕度則比較為低、據印度之經騐而言、二十五年之氣象、實適宜於霍亂之發生、但所幸者、此種傳染病、竟完全未見於中國、</p>
<p>（六）上海及其他港口、雖無霍亂發見、而痢疾　傷寒、則甚盛行、其中以傷寨尤為猖獗、該病之死亡率、在上海汕頭厦門及廣州等處、均甚高、茲將上海二十四年與二十五年之病例列後、最高之數、見於七八兩月、</p>
<p>傷寒　痢疾</p>
<p>病例　死亡</p>
<p>二十四年　四二四</p>
<p>二十五年　六六四</p>
<p>病例　死亡</p>
<p>三〇二　四〇六　七五</p>
<p>三一六　四四九　七八</p>
<p>中國軍隊、均受强迫之抗傷寒注射、患此病者甚少、實足證明該項注射之價値也、</p>
<p>（七）茲將上海各衛牛機關所供給之抗霍亂注射數目列後、去年注射總數七六七七二五</p>
<p>（八）此為本年末决之公吿、防止霍亂臨時事務所、對於各市政衛生機關及其他團體之努力協助深為感幸、蓋非有合作、則本所工作無由進行、抗霍亂運動、旣有如此成功、則擴展此項工作、至其他腸病、如傷寒痢疾及各種腸胃炎等、似亦可施行、蓋此類傳染病之原因及預防方法、甚多相似之處、於霍亂所收之效果、亦能得之於其他腸病、本年內曾擬討論改設一防止夏季時疫事務所、以代現在之防止霍亂臨時事務所、使中國及世界有一健康之上海、實一當今之要圖也、</p>

<p>「提倡國貨」這個口號，三歲的孩子也許能喊得很響了。事實上，驚人的海關進口統計，時常可以在報紙上發現，又是無可諱飾的。所以目前國貨運動的工作，不能專喊口號，應常更實際，更深入，脚踏實地的做到，使人人都有「非服用國貨不可」的好觀念。</p>
<p>我們　被選為担負這個實際工作中的前哨。怎能不使我們慚愧而又榮幸呢！我們的工作已開始一星期了。</p>
<p>在這短短的一澗間，訪問過近二十個本埠著名的國貨工廠。雖因時間的匆促，不能有更多的硏討機會，可是，在國貨運動諸先進的提挈與熱誠的各國貨工廠領袖諸君，詳細指示之下，加以實地觀摩所得。令人不得不深信，我們的國貨已日益精進，無論在質地與形式上，都可以代替外貨而有餘的。</p>
<p>一·原料與機器，有國貨可採用者，無不用國貨，且時有發明與倣造。（如亞浦耳電器廠的　絲，天廚味精廠的濾缸，亞光電木廠的機器，新亞藥品飛機牌鉛筆原料，大華鐵廠的鋼皮等。）</p>
<p>二·製造手續，極合經濟衛生原則。（如中法藥房以中國方法倣製外藥的成功，五洲藥房台理化的管理。）</p>
<p>三·日常用品皆　觀，經濟，耐用（如　新織造廠的布疋，章華織造廠的呢絨，美亞織綢廠的綢緞，三友實業社的棉織品，中國化學工業社的時代霜，家庭工業社的前鬥牌牙粉，華生電器廠的各式風扇等。）</p>
<p>四·銷路倡旺且及國外，（中國國貨公司營業頗為可觀。五和棉毛衫，暢銷俄，印。康元製罐廠，天廚　精，十分之五六銷英美。美亞，　興，中華琺瑯廠出品，大都銷南洋，新加坡等。）</p>
<p>這些，都是實際的例證。任誰會巧辯，怎能否認事實呢？看了這些事實，我們還能有什麽更充分的理由，來否認國貨的優點，而忍心在有意無意中去做外貨的推銷員！</p>
<p>幾天以來的工廠訪問，給予我們以豐富的知識，增强了我們對於國貨的熱愛。我們將更堅决地誓為國貨服用人。</p>
<p>幾天之後，我們就要把我們的對於國貨的信心與熱愛，深入巷口街頭，以取得一般家庭主婦的信心，引起他們服用國貨的熱忱。</p>
<p>我們的學識很淺，經騐不夠，幾乎是自不量力的　試着這個工作，但是我們相信，我們將不避艱苦，耐心地工作，使家庭的主婦變作我們親切的朋友，我們之間，將會從家庭瑣事，談到國貨與外貨的比較，愛用國貨是國民的天職。以達我們為家庭忠實服務的目的，完成所負的重大使命。</p>
<p>最後，對於輿論界給予的鼓勵，國貨領袖的熱心指導，以及社會人士的督責，我們有說不出的感謝。只好讓我們把自身工作上的努力，作為敬禮罷！</p>

<h3 id="c155">國貨菜 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>某次，林康侯先生黃任之先生等與國貨界諸君聚餐，林先生致慨於宴會酒席之靡費，以値此國難時期，厲行新生活時代，應矯正此種風氣，為國人革新之創，因主張今後吾人宴會，應倡行一種國貨菜，推行國內，示之凖繩。黃先生首先贊同，一時齊聲贊美均表同情。國貨菜者，一名五湖四海菜，四海五湖為四碟五碗，五碗為四肴一湯。旣簡單，又實際，以質料决第其價値，高者五元，中者三元，低者一二元，總以每人所費不出五角為度。而所用食料飲料，均為國產，參翅不與焉。一席之需旣不傷費，而所耗之時間，二三十分鐘可以畢事，此眞大可提倡，而亦値得推行。尤其應自國貨界為之先驅，以普遍於公司商號以及工廠之中，此其效力，捷於影響。吾願舉國念之而實行之！國人乎，當知今日為何時乎？國難嚴重如此，國勢凌夷如此，非厲行節的，不足以與人周旋，非减少消費，不足以倖存於今日。吾人目前自處，只有努力生產，節制享受，生產多一分好一分，享受少一些好一些。非大量生產，不足以自給自足，非小心享受，不足以立命安身。盧作孚先生在民生公司懸一標語曰：「大膽生產，小心享受」。語重心長，此眞有心人之言也。吾人之主張國貨菜，亦小心享受以挽救國難之一耳。吾愛國之國人，其亦知所奮起哉。</p>
<h3 id="c156">「秋」與國貨 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>穎芬林文沈文仙　執筆者胥松子　「九一八」後三日</p>
<p>時間像飛一般地過去，市民國貨年的秋季，很快地又已呈現在我們的面前，颯颯的秋風，已經吹動了各家公司，商塲，高懸着「秋季大廉價」的旗幟。眩人的廣吿，更已在施展他的威力，觸入我們的眼簾。好像很淸晰地吿訴我們——「秋天來了。」</p>
<p>根據過去的經騐，事實又吿訴我們，「秋」是一年中氣候上一大轉變的時期，人們的生活也因此而急需購置一切秋令用品的季節，同樣洋貨的傾銷，這也正是一個最可活躍的機會，在這時候，舶來品的充斥在我們巿塲上，又要鬥新爭異，來爭取他們的顧客了，何况，中秋節又就在我們面前，眼見那一批批的「洋貨推銷員」，又要大買其舶來的烟酒，糖菓餅乾，罐頭食物呵！來做他送人的禮物，點綴這大好的季節，在這裏，我要大聲疾呼着，希望國人再不要犯那過去的錯誤，再不要在渾渾噩噩中，就做了巨大入超製造者。</p>
<p>並且，在眼前，經濟的國難，是已嚴重到恁般地步，外貨的傾銷，已經到吞滅我全民族生機的階段，我們是再不能有「物質享受」的迷夢了。這次，第五屆的九廠國貨商塲，就在這九一八的五週年紀念日開幕，以提倡國貨來表示不忘國難，這是有他很大的意義的，我希望每一個愛國的同胞，都來加以提倡和愛護。</p>
<p>最後，我又要說，當這巿民國貨年，又降臨了秋季，時代的輸子，已快輾去了他四分之三的日子，我們總得自己檢討一下，關於今年過去八個月中的成績，比較去年是怎樣？那末，國貨的產銷，在最近無疑地是都已有了很顯著的進步，特別對於深入內地，努力推銷上，有很大的成功，雖然，阻撓我們而需要今後更加努力的，還待交通建設的發展，和走私問題的解决等，總之，國貨的前途，是光明的，有希望的，只要我們大家一致的努力，一定會發展到一個更高的更新的階段去。</p>

<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉續挫、缺七至十四磅音、印棉亦跌二雜比七五、大阪三品花跌三四角、市塲人心平庸、且金業某商猛烈拋賣　萬五千担外、檯面開盤被其壓迫、均跌二三角、但同業中鑒於地頭售價高貴、一律吸進、迨至收盤回好、查大孚·大豐·長和·福康等則躉批賣出、但瑞大·森康·大昌成·益和·永大·信誠·同和等一致購進、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一角至二角半、午後開盤、市况驟緊、浮戶抵補尤湧、加之　市　　　　　高翔　結果各月比　　收盤價漲三四角、查賣出大孚六千四百担、大豐三千六百担、義成二千七百担、福康四千九百担、長和二萬二千担、吉豐一千七百担、裕大一千五百担、錦昌三千四百担、合興三千一百擔、同興二千八百担、潤康二千五百擔、買進長餘二千五百擔、協成一千八百擔、愼昌一千四百擔、瑞大二千五百擔、森康三千五百担、仁豐一千二百擔、大昌成四千擔、永大三千二百擔、信成二千八百担、源興昌二千七百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>最近兩旬以來之紗花狀况、多室兩方競爭劇烈、從前一般之多方、鑒於國內棉產豐稔有一千六百萬擔之譜、比上年增加一倍以上、於是將多額紛紛斬結、由多　空、以前吸收籌碼最夥之通記·大孚·裕大等三戶、業巳一變拋空、額子巳佔最巨、至於同業、視今庚年成豐收、農民經濟當可實舒、預料紗銷更可樂觀、兩粵時局敉平、近日客方採辦甚殷、廠方現紗大都售罄、紗布倉庫存紗、由三萬七千包、陸續减至二萬六千包、目布疋交易繁榮、紗市愈形鞏固、紗花市塲乃呈徘徊之勢、實則在此新棉登塲之際、原料可望低賤、棉紗成本較輕、有利可圖、且停頓各紗廠、茲以新花上市、多數恢復工作、生產漸漸增加、兼以外商在市競售尤烈、且秋銷時令過去、欲沽善價恐亦難得、故在遠期套賣者頗不乏人也棉花廠方陳棉存枯薄、急爭搶新、需要尤切、但對於遠期棉絕無嘗試之念、但各路產區市價高過滬埠，所以來滬尙凋敝、目前天氣順遂、業外拋賣濃郁、至於棉紗銷路尙稱不惡、售價日漲、廠方購辦原棉不絕耳、茲將最近兩旬之紗花市價列下、</p>

<p>— （巴玲）</p>
<p>據說：生活在上海的人，為了種種關係，因而投浦自盡，或用其他方法自殺的，每天必有數人之多。在這話如果確實的話，那末，這個自殺問題，實在是社會上的一個嚴重問題，絕對不容我們予以絲毫的忽視的。</p>
<p>說到自殺的原因，分析言之，大概不外「戀愛」「生活」兩大要素，的確，食與色，是人生的兩大需求，有的人，為了生活問題的不能解決而自殺，有的人為了色情問題發生了變故而自殺，這兩種原因，在表面上看來，似乎前者是來得嚴重些，然而，就我看來，無論怎樣，自殺總不是正當的辦法。一部人生史，澈底的講來，便是一部奮鬥史，我們生活一天，就要奮鬥一天，食色問題解決了的人，固然應該奮鬥；而生活問題不能解決了的人，却尤其應該努力奮鬥，社會上唯有奮鬥的人，才有生存之餘地。須知麵包不會平空落下來的，明白了這點，那末，自殺是如何的不合理的手段呀。</p>
<p>陶知行先生說：「人生為一大事來，應該做一大事去。」這話說得很對。每個人都有人生的使命，我們既然做了一個圓　方趾的人類，那末，總得要替自己，社會，做些利人利已的事。稍微遇到了一些挫折，便以自殺為「一了百了」的舉動，實在是不應該的事。</p>
<p>朋友：我們應該牢牢的記着：「人生是為大事不，應該做了一些事業而去」的名言。</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>談起馬兒，古今來向為人們所重視的。「愛妾換馬」，播諸樂府，傳為佳話。此其一。又，古今來號稱名將之輩，誰不有一頭愛馬相依為命，與共安樂患難？此其二。因此，馬種的選擇，夙為人們所注意，自是當然之事。按吾國馬種，向不如人，在昔如大宛國等俱產名馬，見諸於各家筆記中，不勝述；近則世界馬種，端推阿拉伯產，吾國蒙古產猶膛乎其後。阿拉伯馬長處，為足健，身高。足健，能和汽車比快；身高，能從人頭一躍而過。而且性靈敏，一經訓練，無不惟主人之命是聽。其難能可貴如此。是以阿拉伯人把他所畜的馬，視同第二生命，大有「不重生兒童生馬」之概。每頭的價值，自五六千金至萬金不等；而公馬尤為名貴，因能與異種交配傳種故。</p>
<p>異種馬欲與阿拉伯公馬交配一次，代價亦至可觀，聞每次阿拉伯馬主可得五六百金之巨。然非僅一次，即可得名種：須經地六七次，然後始能和純粹阿拉伯馬無異。譬如有頭母馬，係豪古產，與阿拉伯公馬交配之後，所產適為母駒。迨其長大，再擇阿拉伯公馬與之交配，而所生又適為母駒。必如是經過六七次後，那頭馬－論公約或母的－可與真正阿拉伯馬的性質和體格無二了。</p>
<p>純粹阿拉伯馬，聞吾國某機關中亦僅蓄有十餘頭，專供交配之用。每頭馬，一天的飼養費達二金以上，足供中人八口之家一日費用，真使人們聞之昨舌，而起「人不如馬」之歎哩。</p>

<p>— 英子</p>
<p>胖胖的，富有布亞喬爾風度的大塊頭，在蓬萊路一帶的居戶，祇要提起大塊頭時，幾乎沒有一個不知他的。尤其是那附近梅溪，西成，愛羣以及尙文小學的小學生們，和他更加熟悉。所以在這附近，大塊頭的名，真可說是聲振遐邇，婦女咸知呢。</p>
<p>不論是天晴，下雨，刮風，落雪。大塊頭一年四季，總是擺着他的攤子，很勤奮的幹他這收入很微的職業，沒有一點倦容，也沒有一絲怨態，整天笑盈的。</p>
<p>他的攤子上，齊備着糖果玩具，以及麵包點心。在冬天有烘魷魚，氽年糕。在夏季裏，更是冰淇淋，酸梅湯。所以雖然是個小小的攤子，也夠說得上是應有盡有。</p>
<p>小學生是他唯一的大主顧，散課時候，也就是他營業的主要時間，在這時間內，他很忙碌的應付這班小主顧們。</p>
<p>大塊頭，雖然操着這種細微職業，可是整年的那樣勞苦着，現在已經積蓄些錢，走進了另一階段，開着鋪子做老闆了。他所以達到今日這樣的地步，是全憑了他堅忍不拔的意志，和刻苦耐勞的精神！</p>

<p>在我們的故鄉——泰縣，——幸而組織了世界紅卍字會分會，無告的貧黎　　不致流離失所，遇有天災時也　有了求濟機關。</p>
<p>辦理地方慈善　事業，全在得人，所謂得人，辦事能力尙在其次，第一，主持者要確有悲天憫人的犧牲精神，心目中只有地方，沒有自己，方能不背慈善的本旨。泰縣的紅卍字分會長，是曹夢魚的尊人德良先生，同時還在任着商會主席，而且已連任十年，推辭不掉。原因　為了在地方上除主持紅卍分會辦理　慈善事業外，還藉重他主持公道，排難解紛，全體商民不讓他擺脫。德良先生屢想擺脫商會，專致力於慈善事業，而竟不可能。</p>
<p>泰縣紅卍字分會，因會址狹小，決定建築大樓二十餘間，約需一萬五千元；各方捐助的也已有了萬餘元；却因救災墊出放振，不敷更巨。直到現在，　被會員找到完成的機會，原來今秋　德良先生六十雙壽，特公議為之祝嘏，而將筵資移充建築費，然而德良先生是否同意，尙在不可知之數。我們現雖旅外，但為故鄉社會計，是頗希望能夠實現的！</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>自從下一次世界運動會決定在日本東京之後，日本人都十分興奮。因為適值日本開國二千六百年紀念，機會十分難得。一方面日本人知道世界運動會在東京舉行之後，收入一定可觀的，所以他們認為世界運動會是發財的唯一機會。他們計算着洛桑大會時，得一億五千萬圓，今次柏林可得一億圓。東京雖然離歐美較遠，因為外大對日本的觀光熱，以及日本銀元的低廉，很足以吸收觀客。這次柏林大會中外籍觀眾約三十萬，在日本因為紀念博覽會的關係，至少有十萬人，大約要耗費一億圓在東京。此外選手在洛桑時只有三千人，此次柏林參加五十三國，達六千人。在東京以三千人計算，每人平均耗費二千圓，那末需要六百萬圓。日本人也是一窩風的，故各地來參觀的將不在白萬之下。每人平均五十圓，合　千萬圓。所以照着他們預算，世界運動會可以使二億五千六百萬元的的鉅大金額，送在東京人的手裏。</p>
<p>報紙雜誌上，也時常介紹在世界運動會時發財的機會。日本人是小本經營的專家，到那個時候，飲食店，香烟店，旅館，遊所，玩具店等，一定大做其投機生意了。</p>
<p>日本因連年擴張軍備之故，近年來對建設事業，遠不及大震災之後的幾年。各省眼看着軍部的經費膨脹得毫無限度，莫不想乘着機會，也痛快的擴大　次。四年後二千六百年開國紀念，再加着世界運動會，雙喜臨門，各種建設便可革新起來，軍部只好敢怒而不敢言。現在預算大會場一千四十萬圓，東京車站改造費六百八十萬圓，道路建築千萬圓，亞令匹克村百萬圓，市政府　千萬圓，其他有民族博物館，博覽會場，建國紀念館等，各種工程至少在六千萬圓左右。</p>
<p>任何事情到了日本之後；便可以成為生意經。世界運動會在日本舉行，那是全東京人做着一筆大生意，故名之曰「福神」。約計為了世界運動會，東京的建設以及耗費，將達三億數千萬圓，東京市民六百萬人，平均每人可得五十圓。唯利是圖的日本人，聽得這樣鉅額金錢，將光降東京，當然不勝觀迎呢。</p>

<p>— 我</p>
<p>二十日日內瓦電，歐洲政治活動之中心點，將於明日移至日內瓦，蓋國聯大會，將於是日在極威脅之環境中開幕，舉行重要會議也云云，我意此種會議，决不會發生多大效力，蓋歐洲杌隉不安的狀態，其原動力全在德意諸國，德已退出國聯，而意亦無形退出，此種政治的活動，僅僅是所謂主張民治主義者片面之活動而巳。</p>
<p>故以歐洲的全貌言之？歐洲現分兩大派別，一派是民治主義派，一派是法西斯派，這兩大對壘的旗幟，任何一方不能撤銷，或是打倒，則歐洲的局勢，决無寗靜的日子，若拆穿西洋鏡言之，第一派是主張保守殖民地，第二派是主張重行分配殖民地，總而言之，不過是殖民地問題而已。在現在這種情勢之下，任何一方，斷不肯輕易讓步，其結果祗有飛機和砲火中解决，日內瓦的紙老虎，拆穿已久，卽使重來修補修補，也必是又袋改搭膀，一袋不如一袋。</p>
<p>我再退一步，從國聯的內幕言之，國聯現在所應當急急解決的，便是西班牙的內戰，紐倫堡與莫斯科之戰談，全世界重整軍備的狂熱，巴力斯坦緊張的局勢，均將為大會此决討論中之不祥背景，但此數嚴重問題，似無一提出，予以直接討論，則此决國聯大會重行開幕，竟可說徒費金錢，徒費時間，徒費精神，其結果必定和我國體育選手出席世運一樣，亦不過吃了幾個湯糰而散，這我認為徒勞無功者一。</p>
<p>其次，阿國出席問題該會所指派之代表資格審査委員會，審査各國代表所奉之任命狀，其中以阿比西尼亞國代表所奉之任命狀，最是困難，二十一日日內瓦又訊，阿比西尼亞要求出席國聯大會，國聯數大會員國，預存成見，國書委員會，應藉故拒絕阿國此項要求，致各代表皆不願任國書委員會委員，更就這一問題，可見國聯的本身，已喪失其存在的資格，當意國侵阿時，國聯曾决議意國為侵略國，當意國攻破阿京而意王兼領阿國皇帝的徽號時，國聯亦並不加以承認，則阿國在國聯會員國的資格，明明依舊存在，未曾加以撤銷，則國聯此决開會，焉能接阿國於國聯會員國之外，現在國聯開會，而阿國代表，將被拒出席，眞不知理由何在？</p>
<p>但是意首相墨索里尼喉舌，名記者蓋趣，頃在意大利日報發表一文，略謂，阿比西尼亞代表團，在日內瓦一日，意大利卽一日不滲加國聯會工作，意大利對於阿國之主權，雖不求人承認，但有一羣亡命之徒，出而代表此項政權，則意國自不能予以承認云云，卽此兩事言之，國聯還有重行開會的價値？國聯開會還能收實際的效果麽？所以我意不開亦罷。</p>

<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）她們的年齡都已老邁，最高的大約有六七十歲，最低的也有四十歲以上了。我從佛堂右側的那一邊門里走出去，看見有一個二十多歲的節婦正在煮菜，傍邊有兩個老婦人，一個在摺錫箔，一個在洗衣。於是我向一個洗</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>衣的婦人打了一個招呼，想打聽這局里的幹事先生在那里。她倒是一個出身大家而且非常健談的女人，她很大方的掇了一隻竹椅請我坐了，然後向我介紹那個煮菜的少婦和摺錠的老婦，原來她們是姑媳倆，因為媳婦死了丈夫願意到這里來守節，所以她的姑也跟了來一起住的</p>
<p>首先她對我說，這里的林先生因事到廣福去了；接着她便告訴了局里的大略情形，因為她在這里已經三十多年了，知道的事情很多。她說到局里的頹敗情形和現在的經費支絀，表示着一種不勝今昔之感</p>
<p>一壁告訴着我，一壁並請我去參觀她們的的屋子，她說這里的屋子本來是很大的，但是許多地方都在坍陷了。</p>
<p>我們正在參觀那些空着的坍屋時，林先生却已從廣福回來，於是，由他來把我招待到接待室里之後，便對我述說了一番局里的過去和目前。－該局原來沒有一定的基本經費，即是各方的捐助，在從前還有點，－目前已經完全斷絕，就是本邑的十張捐票，也每月只能收三百文一張。所有局中的經常開支，除了在局產五百畝田上收來的租米外，還有聖巖山下的一個靈巖殯舍可以收一點寄柩費，此外便沒有什麼別的生產。</p>
<p>田租近年來很難收，即三四年之租也尙有未收起者，故局中經費便發生了困難。因為這樣，局中不得不緊縮開支，將原有的四個辦事員，减　了一個，而局里附設的靈巖小學也已停止，節婦們的兒女便都到了縣立小學里去讀書，所有書籍等費則歸節婦自理，並且節婦們的日常蔬菜也减得十分可憐！</p>
<p>現在局里尙有節婦三十多名，共計大小口子有四十多口，全是本邑人，而據說從前到過最多的時候，這里曾經到過七八十人。節婦之欲入局者，　　　商保荐，並填明調查表，經局調查其身家確實清白，而為無依靠之孀婦，即可入局，而凡有幼孩老姑等亦准帶去，不過進局時須付兩元多的進局費，以便整理屋子用的。進局後，由局供給屋子一間，除飯食外，其他一切費用局中概不負担。在從前，節婦老死疾病等，局中還負責，可是現在完全廢免了。節婦們自己做工所得的錢歸自取，老死後須由本人親族來殮收，或由地方募殮。其有自己兒女長大了，欲成家立業而出局者聽便，但出局也須付兩元多的出局費，以作收拾屋子用的。</p>
<p>平時節婦除上街購物外，不能隨便外出，如需探視親戚或路遠必須住宿者，要向幹事聲請，得到許可後方准，但有限制，每月只能一次，而且不能超過所規定的日期。凡節婦中有犯　者，便得訓令出局。</p>
<p>據說，以前保節局里的規則原很嚴厲的，但如今也不如往昔了，而最近要求進局的孤孀也幾乎沒有了。</p>

<p>早上。</p>
<p>賬房先生一跨進門，就把假紅木的梳妝台拍得應天價響：「房錢！房錢！你說今天付，今天付幾個月啊」。</p>
<p>正用一塊破爛的布在抹着衣櫥上的那面不大不平整的鏡子的李老闆。橙子燙了他的屁股似的跳起來，哀求的地：「賬房先生，不瞞你說，我們這碗木器飯比從前難吃多了，現在的年青人，都講究摩……摩登，他們看不上眼我這些假紅木……」。</p>
<p>「別嚕囌，房錢怎麼樣」賬房先生的神氣好像是老子責問兒子那麼的。</p>
<p>「先生，實在沒有辦法，沒有辦法，請你先生原諒……」</p>
<p>「什麼話，四個月房錢……原諒……放……放屁」</p>
<p>「……沒有辦法……原……原諒」。李老闆急得滿頭大汗，拿着一塊抹布，祇是想不出什麼哀求的話來。一顆汗珠落進眼框里，有拿起些痛，他就拿起抹布去揩眼睛，眼皮上留下好幾條黑缐。</p>
<p>站在賬房先生背後的二個挾着房票的管門人，看見這情形險些沒有笑出聲。賬房先生却連一絲笑意都沒有，臉孔鐵青的：「放屁！放屁！限你吃中飯的時候送三個月房錢到賬房間去，要不照明天就來封門」－說着，把鉛筆放到耳朶上走了。</p>
<p>三個月房錢，三三得九三六十八一百零八元，樓上箱子里有阿菊留着作陪嫁用的四十三元，還有……還有肚綳里的阿象司務的上月份工錢八元，一共是五十一元。怎麼夠呢？李老闆想到這里，心同麻似的。</p>
<p>他雖然轉念到店堂里這些木器了。可是……</p>
<p>隔壁裕昌當「停賞木器」。</p>
<p>李老闆沒有吃中飯，落魂似的呆坐在櫈子上。他腦海里想海不止，一樣東西……有人在門口掉失一個錢包，……航空獎劵……</p>
<p>「呌你吃中飯時候拿去為什麼不拿去」？</p>
<p>以為是賬房先生，李老闆又像櫈子燙了他的屁股似的跳起來。他定睛一看，不是賬房先生，是管門人阿王。</p>
<p>「阿王哥，你是知道窮人的苦處的，你替我向賬房先生說個情，請他寬我幾天」。</p>
<p>「這怎麼可以呢？老實說，這個連賬房先生都作不得主，上面外國人催得很緊。你還是想辦法……」。</p>
<p>「有什麼辦法可想呢？可以借錢的都借過了」。</p>
<p>「阿王的態度像節頭向李老闆要酒錢時那樣和氣：「我們大家都是赤腳人……辦法不是沒有……」　咬耳朶的　咭噥噥的說幾句：「你的木器不止值這些錢，而且告起來，封門什麼的，於面子也並不好看……」。</p>
<p>李老闆在箱子里從四十三元陪嫁費里拿了三十三元給了阿王，阿王，阿菊跟娘倆個站在一旁淌眼淚。李老闆待要問阿王要房票。阿王說：「房票已拿到新衙門去了，你要，就得到那里走一趟」。</p>
<p>在阿王走後，李老闆吩咐上下等整理整理東西。</p>
<p>第二天上午，李老闆已經把所有的東西——假紅木本器都安頓在母舅家的天井里。他不時的在那里嘆着氣。</p>
<p>沒有吃中飯。他對阿菊娘說到外面有找找店基，出去了。</p>
<p>找了大半天，沒有一處談妥的。熱鬧的地方房錢太貴，便宜的又不是些好地方。</p>
<p>回家時，打自己的鋪子門前走過。有不少在那里指手劃腳的說：「……市面不景氣……這家木器店，昨天還是好好兒開着，現在已搬得什麼也沒有……」。</p>
<p>李老闆所聽得這些話心里凄楚得幾乎掉下淚來。他瞧瞧鋪子門開着，賬房先生正對一個人說話，他擠上去聽賬房先生在說些什麼？</p>
<p>「……最少的價錢，四個月空房錢二層擱到三層擱搭得很好，新的做做至少七八元，現在我們要你三十元，十元是開門錢，要頂，至少……」</p>
<p>立在賬房先生對面的人搖搖頭：「我祇打算出一百元……」</p>
<p>李老闆含着一肚子冤屈跑開了。他明白了昨天阿王勸他當夜搬走的善意了。</p>
<h3 id="c223">閩南的童養媳 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 麗天</p>
<p>像別的地方一樣，女人在我們閩南是被賤視的。「在厝從　，　　　　　，「嫁雞　難飛，嫁狗隨狗走」這些對建社會遺留下對女人所加的枷鎖——美德，還是在一般人的心目中牢固不破。尤其是　為女人不會生產，養大了總得出嫁這些念頭，就是城裏的富裕人家，除了頭次孕的，多半都在女兒出生的三天內，就將之「嫁」出去。在那時候，做爺娘的只要花點錢，為之置辦幾套衣裳，和買些胭脂，鉛　，芋頭，香蕉，梨子，橘子，蓮昭花，棉花，貌美花，糖圓，生豬肉，豬骨頭及豆糕等俗例的隨嫁品，將之放在紅籃裏，連同女兒給媒婆抱到任何一家人家——親家裏，就算完了做爺娘的責任。他們對於自家的女兒，也像做生意一樣，就是養大了可得到幾百塊錢的聘金，也認為不合算的。</p>
<p>抱養童養媳的，除了城市裏的小市民，農村裏的每一個角落，差不多家家都有，一個或兩三個不等。就是地主富農人家，也是這樣；尤其是在沒有兒子的，更是需要。因為他們可滿望由童養媳，做將來招進個賢郎來傳後嗣。斷絕後嗣的人，通常是要被人不齒的：就是他今生沒做過什麼惡蹟，人家也要加上他「前世」必定是個罪孽深重之徒。何况抱養童養媳的，也並不是要怎樣用心用神去看顧：一天裏只要花點時間，去哺乳或喂飯就夠了。此外，就任那一無所知的小娃娃，在搖籃多簍裏，去啼哭，去浸屎浸尿。她們對於這樣疑待小媳婦，並沒有感到有何種罪過，因為她們自身也是這樣被養大的。她們也知道自家的女兒，在別人家裏也同被這樣欵待，但她們是不去管的。所謂「在厝祈楠香，出厝火巷柴」，就是說，女兒在厝可以像祈楠香一樣保貴，可給嫁出去了，就得像誰也不願燒火的火巷柴一般，任意遺棄。假使不幸童養媳中途夭折了，養者方面，固然要歸之命運，就是做爺娘的，最多也只嘆息一下：說自家女兒命歹，沒福氣而已。就為了童養媳可任意虐待，她們的死亡律是高到夠駭人呢！據一般人的估計，她們給養大到能成婚或招郎的，十人中最多只三四人而已。</p>
<p>但養童養媳的，並不是要等她成人才减輕擔負。一到童養媳五六歲時，做公婆的就儘可不給一文一錢，鞭責她去打掃房屋，拾落樹葉和看顧小丈夫，小叔子或小叔媳等事情。再過一兩年，就什麼也都來了。洗浟，燒飯，挑柴米，抱小孩，喂牲畜……樣樣都有：食的穿的於她却沒有福份。但做童養媳的，還有多種多樣被疑待呢！就在娘家，假使她被生產的那年是屬「虎」年，或是被　卜的瞎子判定她的「命」是沖着什麼或是歹的，她當然要不容於娘家，而早點被摔出去。一到婆家，她不特要受特別輕視，而且萬一有死亡情事發生，她就更糟了；她不僅要被認做是她所「冲」死，而被虐待，且往往就因不受看顧而凍死瘦斃。可是這可憐的小娃娃，她懂的什麼呢？</p>
<p>說到她們的成婚，也是很悽凉的。她們的成婚，往往在十四五歲時就開始；有時在這些年紀，就已有小囝在抱她們十九都沒有行過什麼結婚儀式，有的也都在生育過後，才馬虎舉行一下。那些當公婆的，都懷着抱孫心切的念頭。因為一有了孫子，在他們死的時候，就可在白燈上，寫着「三代大父」或「三代大母」了。假使再抱個孫媳婦養養，就更可寫下「四代大父大母」了。就是窮得沒錢買棺材，人家也會稱他或她好「福氣」，而他們也像可以死得瞑目了。所以他們對於未婚前兒媳的行為，是不去擔心的。做童養媳的，除了很不例外，也都以為已做了人家的媳婦，而且已被指定做公婆某個兒子的妻子，所以也就只得任那未婚去擺佈了。就在發育未</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>全以前，也很難倖免，因為那些做未婚夫，多半是超過自身五六歲或十幾歲。做公婆的，假使自己沒有兒子，他們也都滿望早點招進個賢郞！一則可减少拖磨，二則有孫子抱，三則可免使小媳婦發生亂子。就這樣，做小媳婦的，常常在正當發育時，就得和一個素不相識的男人，過着性生活。她們是一點也沒有選擇的自由，感到的悲痛，也只得忍在肚子裏。假使男人不高興，那她就得像「賣墓樹」一般，輾轉被出賣。她們的生活是黑暗的。</p>

<p>開篇「關　峯夜探虎穴」</p>
<p>世事如棋一局枰。風雲變幻歎浮塵。自古多少痴情種。閱盡滄桑感古今。想我是，一片俠腸身傲骨。江湖浪跡十年春。自嗟身世蜉蝣客。慣在風塵鳴不平。家樹是，公子多情戀鳳喜。十分恩愛十分情。臨行付託情關重。囑　常留一點心。那知鳳喜是，花蕊一株風雨妬。有誰來作護花鈴。只悔他，誤投虎窟紅顏駐。春鎖重門不見人。一任那，淚滴鵑啼憐夜月。繡緯寂寂泣黃昏。好憑他，暗中阿母傳消息。頓觸英雄側耳驚。所以是，冒險捨身探虎穴。有垣屬耳隔墻　。竊看那，將軍不改狂奴態。有時間，婢膝奴顏乞　人。並且是珠串奇玩多耀目。雅琴受託作調停。萬不料，女兒戀愛黃金物。祗重黃金不重情。自古情塲多總態。黃金好貿美人心。早知道，鏡花水月空成影。悔不該，疑雨疑雲假作眞。但是我，目覩情形常歡息。一時難遏怒潮平。恨不得，為君斬斷此情種。莫負常年付託深。可歎那，公子鍾悄如夢裏。慘成後果變前因。所以是，一封書信郵傳寄。頓使他，辭別高堂促超程，正不妨，寄語情塲失意人。</p>

<p>麟記（一二二〇）下午九時零五分至十時</p>
<p>開篇「風流解」</p>
<p>一分才調一分情。誰是無情誰有情。佳人無不憐才子。才子亦然愛佳人。但有一端堪恨處。情長情短不均勻。也有，平日有情難見而。也有。素來無意却相親。也有，始而亂之終而棄。也有，先成吳越後成婚。不是人心分厚薄。祗緣才淺與才深。豈是變端今日起。從前不少過來人。可敬的，宋弘不放糟糠婦。可愛的，樂昌抱鏡未重婚，可忌的，李益無情忘舊好。可惡的，王魁有意背前盟。麥到柳邊皆可親。詩題葉上也成婚。可笑世人迷不悟。竊玉偷香當正經。露水夫妻認了眞。爭風啜醋成何用。陡惹風波不太平。可笑，不解風流兩個字。自誇才子與佳人。豈非反被風流誤。陽台不是風流亭。便作風流豈在眞。然而，多情不是風流事。縱使風流淡幾分。奉勸風流才子輩。絕無才調絕無情。風流强作多情解。便是風流罪過人。得陶情處且陶情。</p>

<p>開篇「中秋月」（咪咪集剏刋號）</p>
<p>佳節中秋月魄藏。月光如水境淸凉。月圓可作妝台鏡。月色天然似雅淡裝。月華當空呈異彩。月移花影上高牆。那同來玩月人多少。大家是賞月觀花興倍長。莫說那月下看花應滅燭。須知道花前賞月合飛觴。那尋常一樣窗前月。不及今宵月</p>

<p>景良。有的是買醉高　　月玩。有的是扁舟載月一　航。有的是徐行郊外觀明月。有的是弄月吟風入醉鄉。還有那一年一度中秋月。逢着那美景良辰玩月忙。看那月白花香真快意。和那美人玩月更樂心腸。最妙的是到廣寒宮內遊明月。和月裏嫦娥話一場。一曲霓裳歌月內。羽衣舞出月宮房。區區寒月偷新曲。可惜難登明月堂。所以每逢賞月想霓裳。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Retreat of Weng’s Troops from Beihai, Chinese and Japanese Investigators Land; 9th Fleet Marines Land in Hong Kong; 4th Route Army's Wu Jianhong Division Arrives to Take Over Defense; Foreign Minister Arita Reports to the Emperor Yesterday; Atmosphere in Tokyo Gradually Becoming Milder <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a wireless dispatch received here from the Japanese warship Saga, the Chinese and Japanese personnel dispatched to Beihai to investigate the case of the murder of Japanese resident Nakano on September 3 have landed there today. The investigators landed under the protection of a unit of Japanese marines. Beihai is now completely garrisoned by Cantonese troops. After the rear guard of Weng Zhaoyuan's troops withdrew, the Cantonese troops entered the city yesterday afternoon. The Chinese authorities in Guangzhou have telegraphed the Chinese investigators to do their utmost to avoid any unforeseen incidents. Currently, there are nine Japanese warships and two Chinese warships stationed in the port of Beihai. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The troops of Weng and Qiu will completely withdraw from Beihai and Hepu back to Guangxi on the 22nd. A battalion of Wu’s division from Guangdong will arrive in Beihai on the 23rd. Yu Hanmou has ordered the division to earnestly protect foreign nationals. Ling Shifen will land to investigate the Nakano case after Wu’s division arrives. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Weng Zhaoyuan's troops began to withdraw successively on the 21st. Wu Jianhong's division took over the defense of Beihai at noon on the 22nd. The Guangdong-Guangxi Diplomatic Commissioner's Office telegraphed Ling Shifen at 4:00 PM on the 22nd to land. It is expected that Ling will be able to land and investigate the Nakano case before dusk that day. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Domei News Agency: The three Japanese warships ××, etc., waiting in Haikou received an urgent message at × a.m. on the 22nd that the Japanese investigation team had landed in Beihai and begun investigating the Nakano incident. They immediately set sail urgently and entered Beihai. On the way, they met the three warships ××, etc., which had set out earlier at × o'clock yesterday. They will arrive in Beihai at × o'clock this morning. (22nd)</p>
<p>Domei News Agency: The ×× warship, which departed from Haikou at × o'clock, met the warship ×× at Weizhou Island at × a.m. At × o'clock, it arrived in Beihai. Then, the captain of the ×× warship came aboard. After important negotiations, the captain, along with military attaches Suga and Matsuura, and Mr. Katsumada, returned to the ×× warship. Next, they contacted the Fu'an and Tongji warships, which were carrying Chinese investigators. The Japanese investigation team and marines landed at the same time as the ×× warship and the Chinese side, and began to inspect the situation. (22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangzhou Municipal Government issued a good neighborliness proclamation on the 22nd. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Yingrui warship came to Hong Kong from Haikou on the 21st and arrived on the 22nd. Captain Chen Yongqin said that on the way, he saw seven Japanese warships, Yubari, Kuma, Ōdachi, Asagao, Fuyou, Karukaya, and Wakatake, heading towards Beihai. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Nakamura visited Diao Zuqian again on the 22nd and talked for an hour. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the news that Weng Zhaoyuan's troops had withdrawn from the Beihai area came today, the tense atmosphere here regarding the serious Sino-Japanese situation has eased slightly. However, it is implied that if other unexpected incidents occur, it will inevitably cause an extremely serious reaction. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The gunboat carrying Japanese investigators of the Nakano incident in Beihai entered the port of Beihai at 1:00 a.m. this morning. Immediately, it landed with the marines and, together with the Chinese investigators, began the investigation. Although the situation there has eased due to the withdrawal of Weng Zhaoyuan's troops, the Japanese side is still deliberately making a show of force, overthinking things. There are currently three Japanese warships stationed in the port, all making temporary preparations and maintaining strict vigilance. (China United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With a peaceful investigation of the Beihai incident now possible, the tense atmosphere of the past forty-eight hours has eased somewhat today. Although the opinions of the hardliners are still evident, important public opinion is leaning towards continuing the established course of action. The crucial points of the current problem are: (1) Whether it is possible to effectively prevent the recurrence of unfortunate incidents; (2) Whether the negotiations being held in Nanjing show any signs of resolving all issues. Foreign Minister Arita visited Prime Minister Hirota this morning to discuss the China issue. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Arita entered the palace at 1:00 PM to report everything to the Emperor. The news about North China that was reported yesterday has not yet been confirmed. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita and Finance Minister Baba, in view of the importance of the China issue, met with Prime Minister Hirota at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, before the cabinet meeting. First, the three ministers held important consultations. Then, Finance Minister Baba reported on the content of the tax system reorganization plan and the revenue plan, requesting the Prime Minister's understanding. (Domei News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to the complete withdrawal of Weng Zhaoyuan's troops in the Beihai incident and the takeover by the Tan Division of the 4th Route Army, the atmosphere in Beihai has eased since the 22nd. Chinese and Japanese investigators are scheduled to land on the 23rd to begin the investigation. Japanese warships anchored outside the port have not yet entered. As for the former troops of Weng Zhaoyuan, in addition to a part being disbanded, the rest are ordered to be reorganized. Cai Tingkai and Qu Shounian have a passive attitude and are considering going abroad. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Domei News Agency: A part of the Japanese Southern Fleet, led by the flagship ××, departed from Haikou at dawn this morning. All ships extinguished their lights. Under the stars and moon, the ships followed one another and began heading south. It will arrive in Beihai at × a.m. this morning. It seems that the Cantonese army has entered Beihai city. Division Commander Tan was the division commander at the time of the Wusong bombardment, and Weng Zhaoyuan was the brigade commander at that time. (22nd)</p>

The Japanese side did not send personnel on the afternoon of the 22nd. It is reported that the Municipal Government has notified the Japanese side again, requesting them to schedule another time to jointly interrogate them. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to the Daogunshe News Agency, Japanese policeman Yoshioka was shot and killed at 11:30 AM on the 19th at the Nisshin Wharf on Taisho Street. However, the Japanese side claims that it was near the Mei Foo Wharf. However, the reporter has been in Hankou for many years. According to what the reporter knows, in August of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], our side set up guard posts in the Taikoo Godown and Yizi Street area. The head of the Japanese Ogawa Police Station personally went to the branch bureau in charge and claimed that the area was within the Japanese concession and forced us to withdraw. After several negotiations, during the time of Mayor Liu Wendao in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], it was reported by the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Huang Zhenxing, that public security management in the area was unclear and that bandits and communists could easily hide there. It was requested that negotiations be made with the Japanese consul to jointly survey and demarcate the police boundary line. At that time, the Japanese consul replied that the boundary line was a straight line from the side of the Sanxing Foreign Firm to the side of the Taikoo Godown (including the Taikoo Godown), and there was no need for surveying. It is investigated that the location of the Yoshioka incident, even if it is the Mei Foo Wharf, is within the Japanese concession, more than 300 meters away from the area under the jurisdiction of our 13th Branch of the Public Security Bureau.

<h3 id="e5">On France's Strengthening of National Defense <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>France intends to use the strengthening of national defense as a means to implement its aspiration for peace. This is the essence of the speech made by French Minister of National Defense Daladier at the Radical Socialist Party Congress in Puteaux, Naune the other day. He said, "We must make the people of other countries understand that we, France, have decided to use all means to ensure that our country is respected by others… Now neighboring countries have already implemented industrial mobilization. If there are still people who think that France should not have the right to organize national defense, and even should not have the obligation to organize national defense, then such people must not be honest." This statement should be able to win the sympathy of international fair people. Because France's strengthening of national defense is fully justified. First, the aggressive groups in the current world have already shown their colors clearly. France is a major country in the peace group. Its strengthening of armaments, even if it cannot suppress the arrogance of the aggressive countries, can at least delay the crisis of a major war. Second, what France fears most today is Germany's retaliatory aggression. After Germany rearmed, it already has 35 regular divisions and 50 reserve divisions in the army alone. Today, France's army strength is 530,000, only two-thirds of Germany's army strength. The French government must make the people of the whole country feel safe about the border. The only way is to strengthen the armaments to the extent that they can independently resist German aggression. Third, although the small countries in Europe all want to maintain international security and peace, when the forces of international aggressionism rise, many of them can easily be coerced into the aggressive group. If France does not think about increasing its national strength, I am afraid that even those close countries, such as the Little Entente countries, will not be able to maintain their ties.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that France's aspiration for peace is sincere. During the last World War, one-eighth of the country's population lived in the country that became a battlefield. The material and life losses it suffered are difficult to estimate. What is the result it got from the final victory? It is nothing more than more troubles and worries than before the war. Is this profound lesson not enough to make France abhor war? Now France is expanding its armaments, obviously out of necessity. We cannot but recognize that its policy of strengthening national defense is for peace, not war.</p>
<p>We Chinese people, like the French people, love peace. We Chinese are also being threatened by aggressionists, just like France. France's plans for international peace and its own security are worthy of our reference, no matter what. In his speech, Daladier ended with a warning, "Our duty is to make France the motherland of free citizens, and not the motherland of slaves." Shouldn't we have the same belief in our own motherland? We know that France's territory after the war has not been subjected to actual aggression, and the degree of threat it faces is far less severe than ours. France is so excited to prepare for a rainy day in order to cope with unexpected disasters. How should we strive hard?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) President of the Judicial Yuan Ju Zheng, Chief of Staff Cheng Qian, and Standing Committee Member Chen Lifu went to Guangdong to complete the unification and flew north on a Douglas plane at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. They had lunch in Nanchang and arrived at the Ming Palace Airport at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Minister of Justice Gan Yongbin, Secretary-General Xie Guansheng, President of the Supreme Court Jiao Yitang, and senior personnel from the Central Party Headquarters and General Staff Headquarters went to welcome them. More than ten people, including Luo Yiqun and Deng Gang, came with them. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, and Chen Lifu went south a month ago to mediate peace and have now completed their mission. At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, they returned to Nanjing from Guangdong with Luo Yiqun and others, a total of more than ten people, on a giant Douglas plane. They arrived in Nanchang at around 11:00 AM for a rest of about one hour and continued to fly east, arriving in Nanjing at 2:20 PM. They landed at the Ming Palace Airport. Because the heads of various agencies in Nanjing had received a report in advance that the plane would land at the airport outside Guanghua Gate, many went to that airport to welcome them. Therefore, there were few who rushed to the Ming Palace Airport to greet them. After Ju, Cheng, and Chen arrived, they returned to their residences to rest. Officials from various agencies went to pay their respects. When a reporter visited Cheng at his residence, he said that all matters concerning the military, government, and finance in Guangxi had been agreed upon after Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu went to Guangdong to meet with Chairman Chiang. The Guangxi army was originally scheduled to be organized into three armies, with two divisions per army, four regiments per division, for a total of 24 regiments. After recent discussions, it was agreed to organize 16 infantry regiments, three regiments per division, and change it to two armies. Bai Jiansheng will come to meet with Chairman Chiang after he has completed the demobilization of the troops, which will take about a month before he can leave Guangxi. Chairman Chiang is now in Guangdong guiding all improvements in the two provinces. It is rumored that he will return to Nanjing before the Double Ten Festival. Bai once had the intention of going abroad for investigation, which may now be cancelled. The Weng's troops stationed in Beihai have withdrawn and are now replaced by the Fourth Route Army. The Nakano case can be investigated. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Cheng Qian and Ju Zheng met with Chairman Chiang on the night of the 21st and talked. They flew to Nanjing with Chen Lifu at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, and Chen Lifu flew to Nanjing at 8:53 AM on the 22nd from the Baiyun Airport in Guangdong on a giant Douglas plane of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters. Luo Yiqun, Ye Baohe, Chen Congzhi, Deng Gang, and Ju's and Cheng's entourage, a total of 14 people, accompanied them. More than one hundred people from Yu Hanmou, Xu Jingtang, Chen Bulei, Chen Qingyun, Chen Ce, Liu Weizhang, Li Xuhuan, Liu Weichi, Xiao Jishan, Liu Jiwen, Deng Qingyang, and various government, political, and military agencies went to the airport to see them off. The First Air Force Command specially dispatched two planes to cheer them on in the air. The Douglas plane was very fast and could arrive in Nanjing before about 2:00 PM in the afternoon. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Ju arrived in Nanjing on the 22nd, the reporter went to his private residence to pay his respects. According to him, he went to Guangxi with Chief of Staff Cheng Qian and Director of the General Office of the Military Commission Zhu Peide in response to Chairman Chiang's call to mediate peace. Fortunately, the country is now unified and the whole world is rejoicing, which is really commendable. As for his personal feelings on resolving the situation in Guangxi, he believes that all our citizens have a heart of patriotism. At this time of serious national crisis, based on this kind of mentality, there is no dispute that cannot be resolved. Therefore, the situation in Guangxi will eventually be resolved peacefully. As for Chairman Chiang, as Guangdong and Guangxi have just been stabilized, follow-up matters need to be dealt with urgently, so he may not be able to return to Nanjing within the next few days. He met with Committee Member Xiao Focheng in Hong Kong. Mr. Xiao promised to come to Nanjing to work and assist the central government after his illness is cured. Regarding the judiciary in Guangdong Province, since Shi Yangan was transferred to be the president of the Guangdong High Court, he is in the process of rectifying it. He will return to Nanjing to handle the affairs of the Judicial Yuan, and then he will have to go south to attend the state funeral of former Chairman Hu. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Chairman Chiang attended the Huangpu Public Welcoming Rally on the 22nd and delivered a speech entitled "The Huangpu Public Should Strive to Implement the Three Principles of the People." The original speech is as follows: Respected elders and brothers of Huangpu, Zhongzheng has been separated from you for ten years. Gathering here today, especially seeing the young brothers, most of whom I had not seen ten years ago, have now grown up. Everyone meeting here, my heart is truly extraordinarily happy. Although I am not a Huangpu native, my spirit has a permanent relationship with Huangpu. Therefore, Huangpu is just like my hometown. Now I am returning to Huangpu, it is like returning home. Today, in addition to thanking the elders and brothers of Huangpu for welcoming me, I am truly extremely happy. Today, Zhongzheng meets with everyone and has no more words to offer, but only hopes that all of us elders and brothers of Huangpu will love each other, work together to create a truly Three Principles of the People's Huangpu, a revolutionary Huangpu, to ensure that the elderly are cared for, the strong are employed, and the young are nurtured. Regardless of men, women, old or young, everyone can understand etiquette, know shame, abide by discipline, and love the country. In particular, young students and disciples should know how to respect their parents, respect their teachers, love their classmates, be diligent and thrifty, and become true revolutionary youths and modern citizens. In the future, after leaving school, they can, like the students of the Huangpu Military Academy ten years ago, be loyal to the country, benefit the people, and work hard to save the country and save the people. This is the most important spirit of the Three Principles of the People of the General, and also the key to the General's teaching us to succeed. I hope that all elders will use this to teach their children, and that all the children will use this to respect their parents, so that the revolutionary Huangpu will always have glory.

<h3 id="e16">Li Qingxuan Goes to Peiping to Investigate; Existing Smuggled Goods Will Be Cleared Up; White Rechter Arrives in Tianjin to Visit the Customs Commissioner <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Qingxuan met with Song Zheyuan and Chen Juesheng again at 11:00 AM on the 22nd to discuss anti-smuggling and matters concerning the Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate. He went to Peiping at 4:00 PM to investigate and will return south next week to report. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) White Rechter, the anti-smuggling commissioner of the Shanghai General Customs Office, visited Li Qingxuan at 9:00 AM on the 22nd to exchange opinions. He attended a banquet hosted by Sun Weidong at noon. He visited Customs Commissioner Xu Liya at 2:00 PM to discuss thorough anti-smuggling measures. He will visit Song in the coming days to discuss matters. Tianjin sources say that White Rechter's visit to the north mainly concerns the arrangements for anti-smuggling and to investigate the current situation of smuggling, which is unrelated to Li Qingxuan's mission. The handling of matters concerning the Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate is being handled by Li and Sun Weidong, without the involvement of the Customs. The Ministry of Finance will provide further instructions to the Customs in the future. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Weidong said that Li Qingxuan's discussions with him in Tianjin on anti-smuggling measures are intended to delineate the scope of authority with the Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate. They have already reached some initial understandings. White Rechter, the anti-smuggling commissioner of the Shanghai General Customs Office, came to Tianjin to take responsibility for the investigation, as anti-smuggling requires a great deal of assistance from local authorities. Therefore, he came specifically to negotiate. The Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate is an agency for suppressing bandits and military arms. It naturally exists. It has not stipulated tax rates for smuggled goods, nor is it prepared to collect fees and release them. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly established Chief Inspectorate for the Collection of Consumption Taxes on Smuggled Goods in North China has received an order from Song Zheyuan to temporarily suspend its activities pending the outcome of negotiations between Li Qingxuan, a counselor of the Ministry of Finance, and the Hebei-Chahar authorities. It is said that the purpose of these negotiations is to discuss a win-win solution: while taxes must be levied on smuggled goods entering the country, it must not impinge on the integrity of the national customs administration. The previous proposal by the Hebei-Chahar authorities to levy a tax equivalent to only one-eighth of the regular duty, and to exempt all penalties after tax payment, has been rejected by Nanjing. However, supporters of this tax say, "One-eighth is a small amount, but it is better than nothing." At the same time, although the customs authorities have made efforts to investigate and suppress the transportation of smuggled goods from Tianjin to various places, the quantity has not decreased. Smugglers, due to tight surveillance on the railway, have switched to using various highways for transportation. Large numbers of trucks, sometimes as many as three or four, fully loaded with white sugar and other smuggled goods, are seen departing from Tianjin and heading to various villages in the interior. Currently, the Hebei-East region only levies a small amount of tax on smuggled goods entering the country, so many smugglers are flocking to transport goods into the country via this route. This allows them to avoid paying customs duties and evade customs seizures and confiscations. It is said that the amount of smuggled goods entering Tianjin is currently enormous, far exceeding the amount of goods transported from Tianjin to various inland areas. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 22nd, more than a thousand bags of sugar and over three hundred pieces of rayon smuggled from Hebei-East were transported into a certain concession by automobiles from a certain country. Recently, the number of smuggled goods entering Tianjin via Qikou and transported north through Cangzhou has been increasing daily. The amount stored in a certain concession in Tianjin is excessive, and prices have fallen sharply. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Qingxuan, a counselor of the Ministry of Finance, who went to Peiping to discuss and resolve anti-smuggling measures with the Hebei-Chahar authorities, telegraphed that he will return to Nanjing to report in the coming days. As for the General Office for Anti-Smuggling on Land Routes of the Customs, there was a proposal to move it to Tianjin, but it is currently temporarily located in the capital.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters stipulates that the ballots used in the election will use the unnamed single-choice method according to the sixth article of the election law, and will not use writing, but will use circles, which is different from the situation during the election of senators.

<h3 id="e23">Shanghai Press Submits a Petition Requesting Remediation of Difficulties in Election Facts; Qu Shao Yi and Others Submit Two Points to the Central Government; Hoping That Both Law and Facts Are Taken Into Account <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) For the National Assembly election, journalist associations in various places have successively elected candidates according to law. However, the organization of journalist associations and the number of members in various provinces and cities are clearly different. Therefore, journalist circles in places such as the capital Xijing and Hankou have already felt the practical difficulties and have successively requested remediation from the central government. Qu Shao Yi, Jiang Jianhou, Sun Menghua, Qian Hua, Xu Chihen, Jin Huating, Wu Zhongyi, Chen Wanli, Ma Chonggan, Guan Jiu'an, Sun Daosheng, Li Zutang, and other members of the executive and supervisory committees of the Shanghai Journalists Association have also jointly submitted a petition to the Central National Government and the General Election Office in their individual capacities, stating that the organization of journalist associations does not have fixed regulations like other free professional groups, and the acquisition of membership qualifications is not strictly limited. The proportion of associations and the difference in the number of members in various provinces and cities vary greatly. The exercise of the right to vote loses its balance, and the promotion of the election administration is difficult to be universal. Shanghai's press has the longest history of development and the widest scope of expansion, but the association only has more than 200 members. It has already elected candidates some days ago and should quietly wait for the central government to circle the candidates. However, it is deeply concerned that it will inevitably be unable to be elected due to the small number of members during the final election. Shanghai's press inherently represents the nature of the entire country, but according to natural trends, all candidates will inevitably be defeated, which cannot but be considered a regret. Moreover, other areas with relatively developed press are also feeling the same obstacles as Shanghai and have made more urgent appeals than Shanghai. This is the first request for remediation. Although the election of journalist representatives is not subject to regional control, according to the principles of election, all outstanding members of the national press who hold the center of gravity of the press must be given the opportunity to participate in order to live up to the expectations of the central government. Today, in important cities and culturally developed areas, many reporters are unable to exercise their right to vote because associations have not been established, and it has been difficult to count. Moreover, the capital is the political center, and the press has developed rapidly in recent years. It has also failed to establish an association and has not been able to elect candidates, which is even more insufficient to show fairness. This is the second request for remediation. As for how to remedy the situation, the central government naturally has the right to weigh the situation, but it hopes that both legal and factual circumstances will be taken into account, both to promote the success of the election administration and to comfort the expectations of the country. We respectfully offer our humble suggestions for consideration. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e28">League of Nations Assembly in a Dilemma; Issue of Abyssinia's Attendance; Submitted to the World Court for Adjudication; Fierce Debate in the "Executioner" Committee; This Decision Controlled by Small Countries; Italian Delegation Hesitates After Hearing the News <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting this afternoon, electing Argentine representative Lamas as Chairman. The Abyssinian representative is temporarily attending as usual. The Credentials Committee announced that the issue of the credentials of the representatives of various countries has been postponed until next Tuesday for a decision. The Italian delegation is still absent. The delay in resolving the issue of credentials is due to the fact that the majority of small countries do not want to create a bad precedent on this issue, and it is possible that it will be rejected in the Assembly. Some have indicated that the committee may submit this issue to the Hague International Court of Justice for arbitration. In order to maintain its seat in the Assembly, the Abyssinian delegation submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations today, stating that 36 provinces in Abyssinia are still under the jurisdiction of the government established in the western Gohr region. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It has been reliably learned that the Credentials Committee of the League of Nations Assembly discussed the Abyssinian issue today. The representatives debated fiercely. Finally, it was decided to submit the issue to the World Court. The committee met for a short time today. After a war of words, it was decided to appoint a subcommittee to study the matter and draft a report while waiting for the Hague Court's ruling. Before this, the Abyssinian representative Dr. Mardin had requested the Chairman of the committee, Peruvian representative Tudela, to allow him to attend and state his reasons.</p>
<p>Abyssinian Emperor Arrives in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) The uncrowned Abyssinian Emperor arrived here at 5:35 PM yesterday, flying from Croydon Airport in London, intending to work with his delegation to fight for the right to attend the Assembly. The Abyssinian Emperor was warmly welcomed by the crowd upon disembarking, including hundreds of reporters and photographers, as well as 50 police officers who were there to provide protection. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to a press release issued by the Abyssinian Embassy in the UK, two-thirds of Abyssinian territory is still not controlled by Italian military force. Most of the 36 provinces of Abyssinia remain independent, have representatives, maintain contact with the central government in the west, and have all declared their allegiance to the Abyssinian Emperor. As for the Abyssinian army, it is now under the control of Grand Marshal Imru, who is stationed in the western city of Gohr, which is also the seat of the central government.

<p>(Geneva) Regarding the matter of the Abyssinian delegation attending the League of Nations General Assembly, a final decision has yet to be made. The Abyssinian Emperor has arrived from England and landed at the Cointrin Airport here at 5:35 PM today. The Abyssinian Chief Representative and Minister to the United Kingdom, Dr. Martin, welcomed him at the airport. A large crowd welcomed the Abyssinian Emperor. When the Abyssinian Emperor arrived in Geneva, the League of Nations General Assembly was in session electing a chairman. Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas was elected chairman with 44 votes to 1. The dissenting vote was cast by Australian representative Bruce. There were also 4 abstentions.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Greek representative Politis, in the name of the Credentials Committee, submitted a report to the assembly, stating that out of the 52 member states attending the assembly, the credentials of 44 delegations had been reviewed and approved. The credentials of the other seven countries, as well as the Abyssinian delegation, still needed to be re-examined. Therefore, the assembly, based on Politis's recommendation, approved the credentials of the 44 delegations. As for the credentials of the Abyssinian representatives, a final decision would be made after the Credentials Committee submitted a second report. Until a final decision is made, the Abyssinian delegation may continue to attend the League of Nations General Assembly as usual. Therefore, the Italian delegation's attendance at the assembly will be delayed as a result. Italian officials are quite impatient. The Credentials Committee is now scheduled to reconvene tomorrow at 5 PM to discuss and make a decision as soon as possible. It has been confirmed that if the Abyssinian delegation is barred from the League of Nations General Assembly, the country has decided to file a lawsuit with the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague.</p>
<p>At 5:55 PM, Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas took office as Chairman of the Assembly and, as is customary, delivered a speech. Saavedra Lamas first stated that the countries of South America have been working hard for world peace and have achieved remarkable results, as can be seen in the peaceful resolution of the Chaco War. He asserted that the League of Nations should address the issue of amending the Covenant with a calm and cautious attitude. As for the major countries that have not yet joined the League of Nations, efforts must be made to persuade them to cooperate with the League of Nations. This is undeniable, as the absence of these major countries from the League of Nations reduces its universality and weakens collective security. In conclusion, he stated that the League of Nations should be open-minded and accept criticism from all sides. He also stated that when the League of Nations was founded, all countries pledged to provide spiritual assistance to promote the common welfare and unity of all nations, even at the cost of some sacrifice. He now hopes that member states will uphold this spirit and cooperate to promote the development of the League's cause. After the Chairman's speech, the assembly was adjourned to reconvene at 10 AM tomorrow, and all delegations were asked to re-elect the Vice-Presidents and committee members of the assembly tomorrow morning.

<p>(London) According to a Times of London Paris correspondent, French Premier Blum and British Foreign Secretary Eden discussed important issues yesterday, including the reopening of disarmament negotiations. It is now believed that the British government is gradually proceeding with this matter in accordance with French suggestions. This is because: (1) Even the major countries engaged in the arms race are indeed showing signs of a willingness to rest due to the psychological and economic pressure caused by the competition; (2) Blum's recent success in easing communist attacks and resolving the dangerous labor unrest of textile workers has led to stability within France. French cabinet members now hope that a general European solution and the limitation of armaments will eventually lead to a reduction in armaments by addressing the matter from an economic rather than a political standpoint. The basic idea of Blum's new draft negotiations remains that, regardless of whether Germany joins or not, Germany's legitimate demands must be closely attended to. The intention is that once the agreement is completed, it should be submitted to Berlin with a condition that if Germany refuses to accept it, it would be tantamount to explicitly refusing to cooperate with other countries in Europe.

<p>Budapest, Hungary. German Foreign Minister von Neurath was entertained by Regent Horthy at his summer residence in Gödöllő both at noon and in the evening yesterday. They also went hunting in the afternoon. Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya departed for Geneva at 3 PM yesterday to attend the League of Nations General Assembly. The semi-official Hungarian Lloyd newspaper recently published an article on von Neurath's visit to Hungary, stating that it did not signify any changes in the diplomatic policies of the two countries. "Germany and Hungary have always enjoyed amicable relations and have acted together to maintain European peace and order. The German Foreign Minister's visit only serves to demonstrate the good relations between the two countries. Although von Neurath's visit is of a private nature, given the strong friendship between the two countries, it is only natural for him to interact with Hungarian diplomatic leaders. It would be a great mistake to conclude that Germany and Hungary will have large-scale new plans as a result. We can now confidently assert that neither Germany nor Hungary will abandon their usual correct path and disrupt the European situation with reckless actions, including the future Vienna conference. The Vienna conference is an event that should take place according to the Italo-Austrian-Hungarian Protocol. Although there are many rumors from the outside world, the Italo-Austrian-Hungarian three countries are committed to peace, which is universally known. This Vienna conference will simply be held as usual." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Athens. German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Joseph Goebbels, accompanied by German Chargé d'Affaires Dr. Kurt, visited the Athens Royal Palace today, followed by a lengthy meeting with Prime Minister Metaxas. The Greek Prime Minister told Greek journalists that his talks with Dr. Goebbels were of a friendly nature, and that Goebbels expressed a deep understanding and interest in Greek culture. Goebbels then visited the Greek Director of News and Information, Nicolidis. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>Brussels. The Belgian government, in response to Germany's extension of military service, intends to find ways to extend the Belgian military service period to counter it. A joint meeting of the military committees of both houses of parliament was convened to study the matter. It is now reported that parliament may convene an extraordinary session on October 15 to pass a bill to increase the military service period. The Minister of the Army is expected to follow the recommendation of the joint meeting of the military committees of both houses and propose increasing the infantry service period by 18 months and the service period for other branches by 12 months.

(Reuters, 22nd) It was stated that the Italian troops now occupy only a small part of Abyssinian territory, and that a legitimate government still exists in the western Abyssinian city of Gore at this time. The representative has various documents to prove this. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Evening Standard, Abyssinia's temporary exemption from appearing before the League of Nations and continued recognition as a member state of the League of Nations was due to pressure from small countries. If British Foreign Secretary Cranborne and French Foreign Minister Delbos cannot find nine representatives to serve on the Credentials Committee, the Committee has been dubbed "the executioner" in the League of Nations lounge. The Abyssinian delegation is still attending the League of Nations General Assembly, and the matter may have to be settled by the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The League of Nations' postponement of the discussion of the Abyssinian delegation's attendance at the assembly has angered Italy. Well-informed sources believe that Italy may take strong action. At the same time, the Italian delegation's departure for Geneva has been delayed. According to official statements, the Italian delegation plans to depart by train as soon as it receives news of the Abyssinian delegation's exclusion. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The authorities here view the League of Nations Credentials Committee's decision to refer the matter of Abyssinia's attendance at the assembly to the International Court of Justice as a deliberate obstruction of attempts to restore harmony between Italy and the League of Nations. It is felt that this decision strikes a blow to hopes for stability in the overall European situation. The Italian delegation has now decided not to proceed to Geneva. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The general public here believes that the international situation will become more difficult as a result. It is said that the Italian government is indifferent to the final decision of the League of Nations General Assembly.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Credentials Committee held a closed-door meeting this morning and discussed the issue of Abyssinia's representative attending the General Assembly for two hours. It finally decided to propose to the General Assembly that a special procedure be adopted: since Italy has conquered Abyssinia and declared the establishment of the Italian Empire, it should seek the opinion of the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague on whether the credentials of the Abyssinian representative are still valid, in order to be cautious. The Committee also appointed a subcommittee of legal experts to study two issues this afternoon: (1) How to present this precise question to the Hague Court; (2) What impact this procedure will have in all respects, especially whether the Abyssinian representative should temporarily suspend their right to attend the General Assembly before the International Court of Justice makes a ruling.</p>
<p>The Credentials Committee's decision will naturally be submitted for discussion when the League of Nations General Assembly holds a public meeting tomorrow. League of Nations officials believe that whether the request for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is made by the General Assembly or the Administrative Council, the Court may not be able to render a decision before the end of this session, no matter how quickly it handles the matter. In short, the only consequence of the Credentials Committee's decision is that the Italian representatives will not attend the General Assembly before the International Court of Justice expresses its opinion, and it is even possible that they will not attend until the end of this session.

<p>(London) Naval Minister Sir Samuel Hoare, who recently toured the Mediterranean, returned to London today and issued the following statement: "Britain has no intention of abandoning its position in the Mediterranean and intends to find ways to deal with the various difficult problems that have recently arisen, and to make Britain's position even more secure in the future. This action by Britain is not intended to threaten anyone. It should be noted that we currently have no newly established Mediterranean policy. We will continue to maintain our original policy and maintain friendly relations with other countries to make the Mediterranean more stable and prevent our transportation from being affected. Although the air problem has changed the situation, it still cannot change our policy, but it will be slightly modified to suit the current situation." Hoare also mentioned the future of Cyprus, saying that the island should have a good harbor for development. The area of Troodos on the island has the best summer resort, about 6,000 feet above sea level. The recent Italo-Abyssinian war has prompted the British to focus their attention on the situation in the Mediterranean and find ways to remedy its shortcomings. Hoare also explained the significance of this tour of the Mediterranean as follows: (1) To meet with the officers and sailors of the British fleet stationed there, because he did not want to learn about their work only from reports, but had to see it for himself; (2) To understand whether the lessons he had learned in the Mediterranean in the past twelve months were consistent with the facts. When Hoare was in Gibraltar and Malta, he had detailed discussions on the issue of dock protection. Hoare's above statement was issued to reporters by the Admiralty. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) It is heard that Turkish Prime Minister İsmet İnönü will come to London in October to negotiate an East Mediterranean Agreement with the British government. Political figures attach great importance to this move. King Edward VIII of England visited the Balkan countries and met with Turkish President Atatürk in Istanbul on the 5th of this month. The two heads of state discussed the conclusion of an East Mediterranean Agreement between Britain and Turkey. Turkish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ruşen Eşref Ünaydın, also participated in the talks. After returning home, King Edward VIII informed Foreign Secretary Eden of the results of the talks between the British and Turkish heads of state at Buckingham Palace. Turkish Prime Minister İsmet İnönü has now decided to visit Britain next month in return, and will bring with him military, political, economic, and financial experts to negotiate the East Mediterranean Agreement between the two countries with the British government. British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Percy Loraine, will also come together. One theory is that Turkish President Atatürk may come to London in person, which is also possible. Therefore, preparations for the Anglo-Turkish meeting are now underway. Once Turkish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ruşen Eşref Ünaydın, arrives in London this week, negotiations on the meeting agenda and all preparations can begin. Those in charge are very pleased that this negotiation can be realized soon, and believe that Egypt can also participate in the East Mediterranean Agreement if necessary, so that Britain, Turkey, and Egypt can cooperate to resist Italian expansion to the East. Diplomatic figures believe that Turkey has a wide influence among Islamic countries and will be willing to assist Britain in peacefully resolving the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.

<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce announced today that the approval of United Airlines to operate Pacific passenger aviation has been approved, and the first passenger aircraft is scheduled to depart on October 21. The Department also issued a letter from Conney, the Director of Commercial Aviation, to United Airlines, temporarily approving passenger flight pending the issuance of the final certificate. Department of Commerce officials said that the publication of this letter is equivalent to final approval. The letter also approved Alameda, California, Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and Manila, Philippines, as air and passenger stations that can be used for boarding and alighting, but Hong Kong as the final destination was not specified. The Bureau of Commercial Aviation will also closely monitor the company's flight operations. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Manila) According to officials of the Department of Commerce here, Pacific Aviation is sufficient to restore the commerce of the three American territories of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam. At present, the trade relationship between the Philippines and Hawaii and Guam is not significant. Last year, the Philippines exported a total of US$251,786 to Hawaii and imported a total of US$288,086, and exported US$229,810 to Guam and imported US$48,268. After Pacific Aviation handles passenger and mail transportation at the same time, the trade relationship between the three places will surely develop greatly. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

Many special police officers have been dispatched to Hokkaido and other northern cities to serve. Anyone traveling to these areas during the manoeuvres will be subject to frequent police questioning. It is heard that during the ten days from mid to late October, the police will also give the same advice to foreigners planning to travel to eastern Japan, such as Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, because the Emperor will participate in naval manoeuvres near Kobe.

<p>Madrid. Special dispatch from our correspondent: Since the Nationalist forces advanced towards Madrid from the north and south, all newspapers have been reading that this city will become the "Verdun of Spain." The forces of both the government army and the Nationalist army are now concentrated on the central front line. The Nationalist forces are planning to follow the western route taken by Napoleon during his conquest of Spain in 1808, namely along the Tagus River valley, straight to the capital city of Madrid. Recently, the Nationalist forces have intensified their advance in the areas of Toledo and Talavera, precisely for this reason. However, although the Nationalist forces are advancing with all their strength in order to complete the encirclement of Madrid, the troops on the Talavera side are still in Santa Olalla, which is still 100 kilometers away from the railway hub of Aranjuez. As for the area north of the capital, especially the Guadarrama mountain front line, there has been no major change in the war situation for two months. In addition, most of the battlefront there is on the peaks of mountains, with elevations averaging between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level. The Navacerrada mountain pass, for example, is as high as 1,900 meters. Snow is about to fall, and the temperature will be 15 to 20 degrees below freezing. Therefore, the war in that area will definitely become increasingly difficult in the future. In addition, the government forces are constantly transferring fresh troops from Barcelona to reinforce the various positions. It is ultimately difficult to predict who will win.

<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the announcement today that the Japanese cabinet had approved the new tax plan of the Ministry of Finance, the market price of listed bonds on the stock exchange has fallen by one yen to six yen. According to this new tax plan, revenue for the next fiscal year will increase by 200,000,000 yen, and revenue for the following year will increase by 300,000,000 yen. The source of the aforementioned increase in revenue will be due to increased taxes on income, property, business profits, inheritance, domestic products, textiles, sugar, housing, stock exchanges, and other taxes. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minister of Finance, Baba Eiichi, stated the following in the form of a statement to thoroughly streamline the tax system:</p>
<p>This reform of the tax system, in terms of its significance and scale, will be a landmark event in the Japanese tax system. It will correct the imbalance in the national burden, directly and indirectly contribute to the stability of national life, and obtain a considerable degree of increase to strengthen finances and facilitate the implementation of several important national policies. The elasticity of the tax system has been deeply considered. In view of the current internal and external situation, this seems to be of great significance. Therefore, the national economy, which is the foundation of the tax system, will undergo rapid changes, and its purpose is of course not to hinder its development. The modern national expenditure must be the responsibility borne by all the modern citizens based on their ability, and it is hoped that it can contribute to the advancement of Japan's national destiny. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Finance, the newly established tax items are five types, including house tax (transferred from local tax), property tax, sales tax, excise tax, and securities transfer tax. Among them, the tax items to be implemented from the 12th year are the sales tax, securities transfer tax, excise tax, and corporate tax in the property tax. As for the house tax and the individual tax in the property tax, the investigation of rent revision, property evaluation, etc. will take about one year, so it is scheduled to be implemented in the 13th year. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The net revenue of the national treasury for this tax system streamlining plan is 200 million yen in the first year and 300 million yen in each subsequent year. Compared with the original plan of the Tax Bureau, it has been considerably reduced. However, the national treasury taxation is thus obviously eased. According to the unreleased revenue from the reform of the customs tax system, there will be an increase of about 30 million yen. In addition, the reduction of the local tax burden in the national treasury increase is about 220 million yen in the first year. Therefore, if the national tax increase from this tax system reform is comprehensively considered, it will nominally be about 450 million yen in the first year and about 500 million yen in ordinary years.

<h3 id="e59">Gao Bandit Gang Splitting Up and Fleeing; Traces of Bandits in Four Counties: Huanggang, Huangpi, Huang'an, and Macheng. Garrison Troops and Security Regiments Begin Joint Suppression. <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The bandits under Gao Junting in eastern Hubei are repeatedly disturbing various counties, and the people are suffering greatly. Although the central government has dispatched a large army to jointly suppress them with the security forces of various counties, they have been unable to completely eliminate them as they are suppressed in one place and then flee to another. Recently, Pacification Director He Chengjun and Provincial Chairman Yang Yongtai convened a border area suppression meeting to determine strategies. Chairman Chiang also telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang, who was in the Wei area, stating that before he returns to his defense area, Director He should supervise the suppression of the remnants of this bandit gang. Recently, it has been reported that the remnants of the bandits have split up and fled in the four counties of Huanggang, Huangpi, Huang'an, and Macheng in eastern Hubei. One group of more than 600 people fled from Shangcheng to the Yantian River and Xiongjia Ao areas of Macheng County. Another group of more than 300 people fled from Daqishan in Huanggang County to the Gunzi River and Baifusi areas northeast of Tuanfeng County. Another group of more than 400 people passed through the borders of Huangpi and Huang'an counties and fled to the Sandian Street area of Huanggang County. Another group of more than 200 people fled from Fujianchang River to Chengmagang and Yangliutang in Macheng County. Another group of more than 100 people fled from Lingyun Temple in Fuzhou to the Qiliping and Tiantai Mountain areas in Huang'an County. Another group of more than 700 people occupied the Daxiaojiulong Mountain, Wuyue Mountain, and Daxiaowushan areas of Liluo County. Recently, the bandits spreading in Huanggang County have become quite rampant. According to information from Dongsan, Xinzhou, Cangbu, Liji, Yangluo, Weijiazui, and Zhujiaji have either become bandit dens or are frightened several times a night. Yesterday, people from Wuhan gathered to discuss the situation. In addition to petitioning the military authorities to dispatch more capable troops for suppression, they also plan to establish a Rural Clearing Committee to assist in the operation. It is reported that the units of Wei Lihuang and Liang Guanying, as well as the security regiment of Ding Bingquan, have now begun joint suppression, and it is expected that the area can be cleared soon.

<h3 id="e60">Zhang Jia'ao Arrives in Guangzhou to Finalize Plans for Building a Huangpu Branch Line; Route to Run from Xicun via Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Yuzhu; Total Cost Including Port Development Fee Is 10 Million Yuan <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The situation in the Southwest has recently been peacefully resolved, and the central authorities are taking the opportunity to develop transportation and promote economic construction. Of these economic construction projects, nothing is more important than the development of Huangpu Port and the construction of a branch line of the Yuehan Railway. Premier Chiang telephoned Railway Minister Zhang Jia'ao at the beginning of the month, summoning him to Guangzhou to discuss various ongoing projects. Zhang arrived in Guangzhou on the morning of the 10th of the month on the Yuehan Railway train. Those who came with him included Deng Yiguang, Director of the Chengyu Railway Bureau, Hou Jiayuan, Director of the Xiangmo Railway Bureau, Ling Hongxun, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, Xie Fencheng, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Railways, and a total of 15 secretaries and specialists. Zhang went to Huangpu on the same day to meet with Premier Chiang, reporting on the general situation of his inspection of railway affairs along the way. On the 12th, Premier Chiang summoned Minister Zhang, the directors of various railway bureaus, and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu at the Huangpu Executive Office. In addition to Minister Zhang, those who attended that day included Ling Hongxun, Li Luchao, Wang Renkang, Li Xiangen, and the directors of various railway bureaus. During the meeting, Premier Chiang inquired about the recent situation of various railways in the country. He then thoroughly discussed the construction of the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway and the development of Huangpu Commercial Port. Subsequently, Zeng Yangfu presented the plans for the development of Huangpu Port, and Ling Hongxun presented the engineering plan for the Huangpu branch line to Premier Chiang for review. A plan was immediately agreed upon, and it was decided to start construction in the near future. Funds would also be allocated by the central government. The meeting ended at 2:00 PM that day. On the same day, Minister Zhang, accompanied by Ling Hongxun, Wang Renkang, Li Luchao, Hou Jiayuan, Xie Fencheng, and others, went to Huangpu to survey the area and measure the construction of the branch line from the Yuehan Railway to Huangpu. On the 13th, Zhang also sent personnel to inspect railway affairs on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. On the 14th, he inspected the road administration on the Chinese section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway with Li Luchao. Zeng Yangfu was appointed by the Ministry of Railways in conjunction with the Guangdong Provincial Government as the supervisor of the Huangpu Port development. The appointment was then proposed by Chairman Huang and passed at the ninth meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Government on the 15th. After all matters were completed, Minister Zhang left Guangzhou at about 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to Hong Kong to await a ship to return north. According to Minister Zhang, concrete plans have been drawn up for the development of Huangpu Port and the construction of a branch line of the Yuehan Railway. The project is scheduled to be completed in the winter of next year. The cost of building the road and constructing the wharf and warehouse is estimated at 10 million yuan. Furthermore, an investigation has revealed that the Huangpu branch line has a significant relationship with commerce in South China. According to information from the Railway Bureau, the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway starts at the Xicun Station in Guangzhou, passes through the suburbs of Guangzhou, and intersects with the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway in Dongshan. It then follows the Zhongshan Highway directly to the Yuzhu Market in Huangpu as its terminus. The branch line is a total of 40 Chinese miles long. The allocation of construction costs is as follows: 2 million yuan for the construction of the tracks, 1.5 million yuan for the construction of the stopping stations and the filling of the wharves, and 5 million yuan for the port development project, which will start with the construction of wharves and roads, followed by the construction of warehouses in the second phase. The total cost will reach 10 million yuan. The funds will be allocated by the National Economic Commission. If there are no obstacles, construction can begin around October of this month.</p>

<p>The notorious soil smuggler Guo Ruzhao (also known as Guo Chunqing) was previously wanted by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters for a case involving smuggling private soil. Earlier this month, Guo was arrested by police officers from the Second and Third Precincts of the Public Security Bureau near the Yuanmiao Temple, Niujiao Hong. After being interrogated by the County Government following the Public Security Bureau's transfer, it was deemed that the case involved a fugitive wanted by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters. Therefore, yesterday morning (the 22nd), detectives from the Public Security Bureau's Investigation Team were ordered to escort the suspect to the province for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Tragic Death by Self-Inflicted Axe Wound <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Liu Linhe, a 22-year-old butcher's apprentice from Wuxi working at the Shunji Meat Shop outside the Changmen West Jin Bridge, suddenly grabbed a large meat cleaver and chopped his neck at around 4 PM the day before yesterday (the 21st), severing his trachea. He bled profusely on the spot, immediately collapsing and dying. The scene was extremely gruesome. Yesterday (the 22nd) afternoon, a member of the District Court was dispatched to examine the body. As for the reason for his suicide, one theory is that the shop owner, Zou Hubao, falsely accused him of theft. However, according to the shop owner's statement, the deceased suffered from a mental illness. It is unknown which of the two accounts is accurate.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Wuxi Coppersmith Beats Rickshaw Puller to Death <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Zong Xiaosizi, a 26-year-old from Yancheng residing at No. 8, Jia 11, Bao 4, Lihua Town, outside the North Gate of this county, worked as a rickshaw puller and was unmarried. He had five brothers, and his father was deceased. His mother, Madam Li, is 58 years old and still alive. Around 7 PM the night before last, Xiaosizi was pulling a fashionable young woman towards Zhoushanbang from the Jixiang Bridge area. Unexpectedly, while passing the entrance of Mengyuan Alley on the road, he happened upon Lian Lingen, a coppersmith from the Dongyou Temple Bridge Craft Machinery Iron Factory, and several others, who had just finished a celebratory banquet at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant (for the wedding of Chen Zifan, the factory's pattern-making director). They were lingering on the road, and the rickshaw puller accidentally bumped into Lingen with the rickshaw's shaft. Lingen became enraged and slapped Xiaosizi several times in the face. He then repeatedly punched him and struck his vital points, and finally delivered a fierce kick, causing him to immediately fall to the ground, his face turning pale, and losing consciousness. After police officers Chen Feilong and Shi Xuesheng from the Third and Fourth Precincts heard the news and arrived, they arrested the assailant Lian Lingen and took him to the station. They also sent the injured Zong Xiaosizi to the Puren Hospital branch clinic for treatment, but due to severe internal injuries to his stomach, intestines, and heart, he could not be saved and died immediately. Yesterday (the 22nd) at 9 AM, Xi Zhongliang, the head of Tian San Tu, reported the incident to the District Court and requested an inquest. At 2 PM in the afternoon, Prosecutor Shen and Coroner Wang went to conduct the inquest. They found a fatal punch wound on the deceased's chest and his testicles were also crushed by the kick. He also had minor injuries on his hands and feet. It was determined that the death was due to the injuries. They then instructed the deceased's mother to prepare the body for burial, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The section of North Main Street in this county is a hub of commerce, but unfortunately, the narrow street impedes traffic and inconveniences pedestrians, greatly affecting business. The Construction Bureau planned to widen it this year, but due to a lack of funds, it could not be implemented. However, local merchants, recognizing the critical relationship between transportation and commerce, proposed voluntarily donating funds to request the widening. More than thirty businesses, including the Jiusheng Silk Shop inside the North Gate, submitted a petition to the Construction Bureau requesting that the section from the North Gate to the Shuyuan Alley be widened first, without demolishing the North Gate Yuecheng. After Director Zhang submitted the petition, in addition to subtly inquiring about the opinions of various parties, he also reported the information to the County Government for verification. The County Government will now convene a County Construction Committee meeting to discuss and decide. Considering this, the widening of the North Gate Street should not be far off.</p>

<p>Mao Yijun, the former director of the Third Precinct of the Public Security Bureau in this county, and Sun Zhongjie, a member of the bureau, were involved in a case of embezzlement of fines, leading to mutual accusations. Initially, the court detained Sun, and Mao was released on a written guarantee of two thousand yuan pending judgment. Li Zhigang, a small owner from Yongmao Ti Zhuang, was responsible for guaranteeing Mao's release. Subsequently, the court sentenced Mao to a fine of three hundred yuan and one year of imprisonment. Mao refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the original judgment. Afterwards, the court in this county repeatedly summoned Mao to appear in court for execution of the sentence. However, Mao, having already been dismissed from his position, went into hiding. The court then summoned and detained the guarantor, Li Zhigang, before releasing him on a written guarantee of ten thousand yuan last month, ordering him to deliver Mao for execution. Li then learned that Mao was hiding in Yangzhou and went there to search for him. He finally found Mao on the 19th of this month, turned him over to the Jiangdu District Court for detention. Li then returned to Wuxi yesterday to report to the Wuxi court. After being interrogated by Prosecutor Ren, he was ordered to return and await the dispatch of police to escort Mao from Yangzhou for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>The Wuyi autumn cocoon market has been open for three or four days, but due to the relatively low prices, it has not been very active. In the past two days, cocoon businesses in various townships have increased prices, resulting in an increase in supply. The Jiang Henghe and Jiu Hua businesses in Hutang Bridge in the southern countryside are receiving more than thirty loads of cocoons per day, with prices ranging from thirty-four to thirty-five yuan. The Tailong, Fuchang, and Xie Tongyi businesses in Qishuyan are receiving more than twenty bundles or ten ancestral units of cocoons per day, with prices ranging from thirty-two to thirty-three yuan, slightly lower than the prices in the southern countryside, resulting in fewer cocoons received.</p>

On the 20th, he accompanied Zhao Xuenan from Suzhou to Changzhou to visit Mr. Qian Mingshan. Qian hosted them at the Luyang Restaurant. Before the meal was finished, Mr. Yan suddenly complained of dizziness and began to stagger. He was quickly supported, but he was already unable to speak. A telegram was immediately sent to the Wujin Hospital requesting that someone be sent to pick him up. He was given acupuncture treatment, but he succumbed to a stroke and passed away. A telegram was sent to his family, and a coffin was brought to Changzhou on the 21st for the viewing.</p>

<p>The Dalu Pharmacy on Temple Street was completely destroyed by fire in the early morning of the 21st, and an apprentice from Shaoxing who was studying there was burned to death. The shop telegraphed his family in Shanghai, who came to Changshu to arrange the funeral. Unexpectedly, that evening, a fire also broke out at the Yonglong Pawnshop on South Main Street, also killing a 65-year-old shop clerk, a situation even more tragic. It is customary for pawnshops here not to light lamps at night, but to go to sleep after dark to avoid accidents. The Yonglong Pawnshop had a cook named Xu Er, 65 years old, who had been employed for more than ten years. Last night (the 21st), Xu followed his usual routine of feeling his way to the upper floor after dinner to go to bed. However, he always had to smoke several pipes of dry tobacco before sleeping. At around 8 PM, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor. Those who heard the alarm rushed to the rescue. Fortunately, it was still early, and the fire was extinguished after a short time, destroying one building upstairs and downstairs. However, Xu Er was suddenly discovered to be missing. While searching for him, the body of Xu Er was found by the Zhendong Fire Brigade in the rubble, his head and face charred beyond recognition, a truly tragic sight. According to the shop's employees, Xu Er was old, deaf, and blind. When the fire broke out, he was unable to escape and was burned to death.</p>

<p>It has recently been discovered that cholera is rampant in the eastern countryside of Xiangshan, especially in the townships of Wujing, Xihan, and Linguan. It is spreading rapidly, and those who contract it die quickly. In the villages of Ma'ao and Shengjia alone, the death toll has already reached thirty or forty people. Furthermore, Eastern Xiangshan is located in a remote rural area and has no hospitals, so when an acute epidemic occurs, patients have no choice but to await death. The residents of the area are now eagerly hoping that the authorities will find ways to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Solemn and Tragic "September 18th" Memorial Meeting <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>...Jointly Held by Various Schools in Beiping... (Special Dispatch from Beiping)</p>
<p>In view of the successive outbreaks of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, the Beiping authorities had already issued clear orders regarding the precautions for "September 18th." Moreover, Beiping has a special status and a large concentration of foreigners. If given the opportunity, the other side could take advantage of it to create disputes similar to the above two incidents in order to achieve certain special purposes. Therefore, the various authorities here were particularly apprehensive and fearful on the fifth anniversary of "September 18th." On that day, in addition to dispatching a large number of soldiers and police to be stationed at various schools and strictly prohibiting outdoor marches, soldiers and police were also deployed at all main thoroughfares in the city to prevent unforeseen events. Most noteworthy was the fact that heavily armed soldiers and police were stationed near the residences of people from "friendly nations," as if facing a formidable enemy, providing meticulous protection and strict security. All of our compatriots seem to need to reflect on the bitter and spicy flavors in this. The reporter went out to patrol at six o'clock in the morning and did not return until eight o'clock in the evening. Although shocking scenes were everywhere, the whole city passed through safely without any disputes. Students from various schools also conducted their solemn memories under heavy and tragic atmosphere, with no other action. In addition to a few schools holding memorial meetings on campus, around 3 PM in the afternoon, all major, middle, and primary schools in the city, in a joint effort with a certain college in Jiaodao, Duanwangfu, held a memorial meeting. This was the only memorial meeting in Beiping that day worth recording. The following is a brief account of the situation before and after.</p>
<p>(1) Before the Meeting Upon entering the area near Jiaodao, Duanwangfu, one immediately felt a serious atmosphere, making one want to flee. Upon closer inspection, it was found that this was due to the dense presence of soldiers and police, detectives moving back and forth like shuttles, and the glittering bayonets reflecting the sun. The situation was particularly serious in front of the gate of a certain college, where the meeting was held. However, the reporter observed that representatives from various schools, as well as male and female students who voluntarily participated, came in an endless stream from all directions. Worthy of particular note was their attitude, which was neither dejected and dispirited, with furrowed brows, nor agitated and impulsive, excitedly moving forward, but rather a kind of air of normality, yet also as if they recognized their own mission and bravely advanced. Their attitude was truly awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Around 3 PM, the total number of representatives from various schools and students who volunteered to participate was more than 600. Professor Tao Xisheng, who was scheduled to deliver a speech, was unable to attend due to a temporary reason. Those who did attend were Zhang Dongsun and Wu Juexian, as well as a certain gentleman who had recently arrived in Beiping from the Northeast Volunteer Army, who had come to participate, attracting attention. In the half hour before the meeting, military and police personnel, seeing that the participants were quite enthusiastic, feared that unexpected incidents might occur during the meeting and attempted to prevent it from taking place. Fortunately, a certain president of the college did his utmost to vouch for the meeting to the military and police personnel. It was heard that the military and police personnel questioned the president, saying, "If any accidents happen, who will be responsible?" The president replied, "I will be solely responsible." Therefore, the fact that the memorial meeting was able to take place was also due to the sympathy and assistance of the president. Compared to the president of a certain normal school in the neighborhood, who tightly closed the school gate on the evening of the 17th and invited a large number of soldiers and police to stand guard with guns inside the iron fence gate, prepared to act at any moment, their virtue and wickedness cannot be measured by miles.</p>
<p>(2) At the Meeting The meeting was held in the auditorium of a certain college. At the entrance, there was a white cloth banner with the nine characters "Fifth Anniversary of the September 18th Memorial Meeting." Upon entering the meeting place, the first thing that caught the eye were five large charcoal drawings hanging on the wall, all depicting the actual situation related to the "September 18th" Incident. The names of the five paintings were as follows: (1) After "September 18th," Northeast compatriots crowded and fled into the customs. When will we "fight back to our old home"? (2) Japanese cavalry entered Shenyang city as if entering an unpopulated area. (3) On "September 18th" of the 20th year, the Japanese in Shenyang city shattered the Chinese people's dreams. (The reporter noted that the various phenomena depicted in this painting were extremely thought-provoking, such as "Overnight, Japanese residents have all turned into soldiers," etc., all of which were extremely alarming.) (4) Among the people who fled back from the Northeast, children asked their mothers, "When will we go home?" (5) The Volunteer Army struggling to resist. All of the paintings were extremely vivid and powerful, and the brushstrokes were very mature, presumably produced by someone with a very deep cultivation of this situation.</p>
<p>A few minutes before the meeting, a male student and two female students from a certain civilian school voluntarily sang songs such as "Fight Back to Our Old Home" and "National Salvation March" in the crowd under the gaze of the public. The tones were mature and the aura was majestic. At first, the reporter thought that it came from the mouths of many adults, but upon closer inspection, it was found that it was just a young boy and two girls, around twelve or thirteen years old, with ragged clothes and insufficient nutrition. The reporter was astonished and admired them immensely.</p>
<p>The procedure of the memorial meeting was extremely simple. After the chairman's report, a certain gentleman who had just arrived in Beiping from the Northeast Volunteer Army was invited to the stage to report. This gentleman's face was haggard, but his spirit was exceptionally high-spirited. It was evident that he was a patriotic person engaged in arduous struggle. He took the stage amidst warm applause and reported in detail on the current situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army. Many things were not easily known to outsiders. The reporter recorded the main points as follows:</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army is currently located everywhere in the four northeastern provinces (Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol). It is now divided into fifteen armies and fourteen guerrilla teams. Among the fifteen armies, eight are called the "Northeast People's Revolutionary Army," led by Wang Degong, Zhao Shangzhi, and others. Seven armies are called the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army." In terms of region, they are divided into five military districts: (1) Liaoning District, (2) Jilin District, (3) Harbin District, (4) Heilongjiang District, and (5) Jehol District. Since this year, the five districts have totaled more than 100 battles with the Japanese-Manchu side in May, with the Volunteer Army numbering more than 11,000 people. In June, there were a total of 270 battles, with the number of people exceeding 12,000. In July, there were 250 battles, with a total of more than 17,000 people. In August, there were 230 battles, with a total of more than 16,000 people. In terms of organization, although there are titles such as commander, everything is elected by everyone. There is only responsibility and no rights. If there is dereliction of duty, everyone jointly decides. The current Northeast Volunteer Army has merged with the people, helping the people to harvest or cultivate, and the people also help them fight against the Japanese-Manchu army. Since Japan implemented the confiscation of civilian firearms, the merging of villages, and the strict implementation of entry and exit permits, the people's resentment towards them has deepened. Now there are two major opposing camps, one being the Japanese-Manchu army and the other being the entire population of the Northeast (that is, the Volunteer Army). Under this situation, the people of the Northeast can only choose between joining the Volunteer Army and being trampled to death by the Japanese-Manchu. The two paths of living in peace and fleeing into the customs are now completely impossible. The Volunteer Army fights the Japanese-Manchu army entirely by guerrilla warfare, which reduces the power of many new Japanese weapons. This is also why the Volunteer Army has been able to struggle to this day. The troops of the puppet "Manchukuo" have extremely poor living conditions, so they often express sympathy for the Volunteer Army, firing blank shots into the sky during battles, called "friend shots." The Volunteer Army also uses the slogan "Chinese people do not fight Chinese people" as a standard and does not attack them, and often obtains supplies of weapons and ammunition from them. The Volunteer Army is currently in an extremely difficult situation, but it is struggling hard and will not be eliminated for the time being. At present, the Volunteer Army has two major hopes: (1) Compatriots across the country within the customs will unite and participate in the war with the Japanese-Manchu and provide the Volunteer Army with material and spiritual assistance; (2) It is hoped that the whole country will unite and urge the government to start a war in the shortest possible time. Then not only will the Volunteer Army be an invincible force, but also most of the troops of the puppet "Manchukuo" will inevitably revolt and return to the right path. After this gentleman finished his report, warm applause shook the roof tiles and lasted for a long time. Amid this continuous applause, Professor Zhang Dongsun took the stage to speak, followed by Professor Wu Juexian. The two said nothing more than to encourage the students, but Zhang, in his speech, had the sentence "We must have a long-term detailed plan," which caused a stir among the audience, and some stood up and shouted "Wrong." This point shows that everyone is tired of hearing the terms "long-term" and "detailed "plan." Zhang simply touched on it unintentionally. Wu's speech was quite enthusiastic and won a lot of applause, but it was just the usual popular saying, with no great special features. After the speeches, an item that was originally "free speeches" was temporarily canceled by the presidium on the grounds that "the time was too late." After this, the representative of the Beiping Student National Salvation Federation reported on the future trends of the Beiping student movement. First, it was said that the Student Federation had decided that there are three core tasks in the future: (1) To protect more than 100,000 young people studying in North China; (2) To protect the safety of the cultural and educational circles in North China; (3) To retain the loyal and brave Twenty-Ninth Army in North China. Furthermore, the Student Federation organization in the future should abide by four principles: (1) To be built on the two points of "saving the country without forgetting to study" and "studying without forgetting to save the country"; (2) It should strive to cooperate with teachers and leaders from all walks of life in the school and society during its creation; (3) All activities should be carried out in an extremely democratic and open manner; (4) The representatives of each school attending the Student Federation should be directly responsible to the students of their respective schools, directly elected by the students, and directly impeached, and no longer be selected and dispatched by the student union. After the report, four resolutions were passed: (1) In the name of the meeting, a telegram should be sent to the whole country, asking the government to publicly negotiate with Japan on the Chengdu and Beihai cases; (2) In the name of the meeting, a telegram should be sent to the whole country, asking the government to strictly abide by the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee and defend Suidong and North China; (3) In the name of the meeting, the Student Federation should be advised to organize a support association for the Northeast Volunteer Army; (4) In the name of the meeting, a telegram should be sent to the Northeast Army to go north and resist ×.</p>
<p>After the resolutions were passed, it was around six o'clock, and the meeting was adjourned. The authorities here, in order to ensure safety, continued to be on alert for one day on the 19th, which can also be said to be the aftermath of "September 18th."</p>

<h3 id="e78">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Receives Approval from the Ministry of Finance; Income Tax Determined to Be Levied as Scheduled; Bankers Association Hosted Liang for Discussion Yesterday; Money Trade Association Forms Special Committee to Study; Agreement Reached on Collection Methods by the Three Banks and Postal Remittance Bureau <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, due to the issue of private inspection, previously convened a joint meeting of chambers of commerce from Hubei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Henan, and other seven provinces and fourteen counties and cities. The joint meeting resolved to petition the government to eliminate disguised likin (internal transit taxes) within a set period, and to levy income tax on foreigners once the procedures were completed before commencing the tax collection. After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, two replies were received yesterday: (1) Received the report. The Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementing Rules have been explicitly promulgated by the National Government and are scheduled to take effect on October 1, 25th year. The matter concerns the legal system and should not be altered. The requested points should not be considered. Please acknowledge. (2) Received the telegram. The Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementing Rules have been explicitly promulgated by the National Government and are scheduled to take effect on October 1, 25th year. Income from salaries and remuneration of public officials under Article 2, Category 2, and income from securities and deposit interest under Article 3 will also be levied starting October 1st. All other income will be levied from January 1, 26th year. The request to postpone implementation should not be considered. Please acknowledge.</p>
<p>Bankers Association Hosted Liang Yesterday</p>
<p>In addition to dispatching Wang Zhixin and Zhang Peishen to Nanjing to present opinions to the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office regarding the income tax on securities and deposits, the Shanghai Banking Association also hosted Mr. Liang Hejun at a banquet at the Bankers Club at 12:00 noon yesterday. Those present included Pan Jiufen, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China; Zhang Peishen, Manager of the Business Department of the Bank of Communications; Xu Xinliu, General Manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank; Li Fusun, General Manager of the Zhejiang Commercial Bank; Yang J眉imei, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Shanghai Bank; Hu Xixian, Manager of the Siming Bank; Qu Jigang, Manager of the Guohua Bank; Wang Zhixin, Manager of the Xinhua Bank; Wu Yunzhai, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Jin Cheng Bank; Zhu Boquan, Manager of the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee; and Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association.</p>
<p>Opinions Expressed in Hopes of Adoption</p>
<p>During the banquet, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, and others first presented their opinions on the income tax on securities and deposit interest, hoping that the government would adopt them: (1) Banks close their accounts at the end of June and the end of December. If the tax is levied from October 1st, it would be necessary to close the accounts again at the end of September. Due to the tight schedule, practical preparations may be insufficient. It is proposed to postpone it to January 1st of next year and levy it simultaneously with other income taxes. (2) Regarding the issue of levying income tax on foreign nationals and foreign banks, if the issue of foreign nationals is not resolved, deposits from foreigners at banks such as the Bank of Communications will inevitably be evaded. If the issue of foreign banks is not resolved, deposits from Chinese may also be evaded. It is hoped that the government will find a way to resolve it. (3) In terms of procedures for levying income tax on deposit interest, efforts should be made to improve the procedures and avoid double taxation, such as deposits between banks, etc.</p>
<p>Liang Accepted and Promised to Forward to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Liang Hejun then replied that income taxes on public officials' salaries and income from securities and deposit interest are scheduled to be levied on October 1st and the order has already been issued to implement it as scheduled. The request to postpone it to January 1st of next year for simultaneous implementation with other income taxes seems difficult to grant. Regarding the collection of income tax from foreign nationals and foreign banks, formal notes have already been sent to various countries. The collection of income tax is handled equally for both Chinese and foreigners, and efforts will be made to improve the procedures. He promised to forward the points raised by the banks to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. At the same time, he hoped that they would understand the government's collection of income tax and assist in its implementation. The banks expressed their unanimous support for the income tax. The meeting adjourned at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Money Trade Association Forms Committee for Study</p>
<p>In response to the issue of levying income tax on securities and deposit interest, the Shanghai Money Trade Association, in addition to distributing the matter to its members for research and seeking opinions, also resolved at the autumn managers' meeting to organize an Income Tax Research Committee. The committee will compile and study the opinions of various firms. It has now been decided to hold an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM on September 25th and a members' representatives' general meeting at 2:00 PM on October 2nd. Each will nominate three members to the committee, together with the three members including Pei Yunqing already nominated by the managers' meeting, to conduct joint research.</p>
<p>Three Banks and Postal Remittance Bureau to Collect on Behalf</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing, Liang Hejun (Jingchun), Deputy Director of the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office, immediately contacted the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to discuss the collection of income tax on securities and deposit interest. An agreement has been reached for each collecting agency to open an account and, following the methods for collecting other national taxes, sign collection contracts with the three banks and the Postal Remittance Bureau. The three banks and the Postal Remittance Bureau have now notified their branches and offices nationwide to comply with the procedures. The collection method adopts a reporting system, whereby each bank will voluntarily report its income from securities and deposit interest, and the government will then conduct random audits of each bank's books based on the reported figures.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Insurance Industry Presents to the Legislative Yuan, Appealing for Exemption from Income Tax, Citing European and American Precedents, Three Reasons Given <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, with the Provisional Income Tax Regulations about to take effect, and because the regulations do not clearly specify whether insurance premiums and insurance payouts should be exempt from income tax, the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association recently presented its reasons to the Legislative Yuan, requesting amendments to stipulate that insurance premiums and insurance payouts for life insurance and various other types of insurance should be exempt from income tax, in order to encourage insurance. Excerpts of their appeal are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Reasons</p>
<p>(1) Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations states that income of legal entities not for profit is exempt from income tax. Those who purchase life insurance do not do so for profit. Even if the beneficiary is an individual, life insurance is relied upon to solve all important problems such as poverty, old age, dependence, illness, unemployment, lack of education, and charity. Therefore, the nature of income from life insurance and the function it serves in society are no different from the income of legal entities not for profit. This is the first reason why life insurance should be exempt from income tax. (2) Article 2, Paragraph 2, Category 2 of the Provisional Regulations states that pensions, retirement funds, and alimony for disabled workers and those unable to support themselves are exempt from income tax. Life insurance covers all matters listed in (卯). Why should general pensions, retirement funds, and alimony be exempt from tax, while insurance payouts used for pensions, retirement, and alimony, and insurance premiums set aside for pensions, retirement, and alimony, not be explicitly listed as tax-exempt? This is the second reason why life insurance should be exempt from income tax. (3) Article 2, Paragraph 3, Category 3 of the Provisional Regulations states that statutory savings of public servants and workers are exempt from income tax. The intent of this provision is to encourage thrift and make them practice saving to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. The statutory savings of public servants are encouraged and enjoy tax-exempt treatment, while insurance premiums used by ordinary citizens to prepare for unforeseen circumstances are not considered for tax exemption as an incentive. Why is it that some citizens are treated favorably while others are treated less favorably? This is the third reason why life insurance should be exempt from income tax.</p>
<p>European and American Precedents</p>
<p>Various European and American countries have precedents for exempting life insurance and various other types of insurance from income tax, either exempting insurance premiums, exempting insurance payouts, exempting entirely, or imposing certain restrictions. All of these are based on consideration of national conditions and determination of the scope of exemption. For example: (1) United States: According to Section 213(b)(1)(2)(6) of the current U.S. Income Tax Law, the following items are exempt from income tax: A. Life insurance payouts received due to death; B. Savings insurance payouts or annuities received upon maturity of the insurance, but if the income exceeds the total insurance premiums paid, income tax is levied on the excess; C. Workers' compensation or accident and health insurance payouts received due to injury. (2) United Kingdom: According to the U.K. Income Tax Act, the following items are exempt from income tax: A. Insurance premiums paid by taxpayers with an annual income of less than £1,000, not exceeding 15% of the taxable amount; B. Insurance premiums paid for life insurance, not exceeding 7% of the insurance amount; C. Deferred annuity insurance premiums paid by the taxpayer or their spouse, not exceeding £100; D. The total amount of insurance premiums not exceeding one-sixth of the income. (3) Japan: According to Article 16, Paragraph 3(6) of the current Japanese Income Tax Law, "When an insurance contract is concluded with the policyholder himself, his family, or his heir as the beneficiary of the insurance payout, the payment of insurance premiums is limited to an annual amount of 200 yen, and upon application by the policyholder, it may be deducted from the income and is not subject to income tax." (4) Germany: According to the current German Income Tax Law, insurance premiums for various types of insurance are exempt from income tax, but limited to 8,000 marks. (5) France: France had previously stipulated in its 1925 budget a very small tax on insurance premiums, collecting 0.01 centimes per 1,000 francs. However, life insurance premiums are now exempt from income tax.</p>
<h3 id="e80">True Cholera Spared This Year; Dysentery and Typhoid Fever Are Quite Rampant; Expanded Prevention of Summer Epidemics <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Temporary Office for Cholera Prevention Public Notice No. 3, recorded as follows, should be good news for those who care about national public health.</p>
<p>(1) More than two months have passed since the last public notice was issued. During this time, close attention has been paid to patients with gastrointestinal illnesses admitted to various hospitals. However, no true cholera has occurred in this port or other ports. It seems unlikely that there will be an epidemic this year.</p>
<p>(2) Many health experts speculated that this year would be a cholera year, but fortunately it has not occurred. Therefore, it can be said that there has been no cholera for four years (except for a few sporadic cases in the 23rd year). The good results are due to increased public awareness of hygiene, more widespread water supply, effective publicity by municipal authorities and health agencies, a reduction in diseases in neighboring areas, and the implementation of widespread anti-cholera vaccinations.</p>
<p>(3) In addition, there are two points that we must mention: (A) The importance of cooperation and health promotion; (B) The elimination of the concept that Shanghai is a cholera-stricken area.</p>
<p>(4) From the examinations of the chemical testing chamber, it is clear that human carriers do not play an important role in the spread of cholera. On the contrary, healthy carriers are most dangerous in the case of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(5) The summers of the 24th and 25th years of the Republic were very hot (reaching a maximum of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and the humidity was also very high. As for the summer of the 23rd year, the temperature was as high as 104.4 degrees, but the humidity was relatively low. According to Indian experience, the climate of the 25th year was indeed suitable for the occurrence of cholera. But fortunately, this infectious disease was not seen in China at all.</p>
<p>(6) Although no cholera has been found in Shanghai and other ports, dysentery and typhoid fever are very prevalent, especially typhoid fever. The mortality rate of this disease is very high in Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other places. The following are the cases in Shanghai in the 24th and 25th years:</p>
<p>Typhoid Fever Dysentery</p>
<p>Cases Deaths Cases Deaths</p>
<p>24th Year 424 302 406 75</p>
<p>25th Year 664 316 449 78</p>
<p>Chinese troops have been forced to receive anti-typhoid vaccinations, and very few have contracted the disease, which proves the value of the vaccination.</p>
<p>(7) The following is a list of the number of anti-cholera vaccinations provided by various health agencies in Shanghai. The total number of vaccinations last year was 767,725.</p>
<p>(8) This is the final public notice of this year. The Temporary Office for Cholera Prevention is deeply grateful for the efforts and assistance of various municipal health agencies and other organizations. Without cooperation, the work of this office could not have progressed. Since the anti-cholera movement has been so successful, it seems that expanding this work to other intestinal diseases, such as typhoid fever, dysentery, and various gastroenteritis, is also feasible. The causes and prevention methods of these infectious diseases are very similar. The results achieved in cholera can also be obtained in other intestinal diseases. This year, it is proposed to discuss the establishment of a Summer Epidemic Prevention Office to replace the current Temporary Office for Cholera Prevention, so that China and the world can have a healthy Shanghai. This is an important plan for today.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Tao Baichuan Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Representatives from All Walks of Life Welcomed Him at the Port, Tao Gave a Speech on the Ship <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Tao Baichuan, Executive Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, traveled abroad last year for inspection, visiting various countries in Europe and America. Upon receiving a telegram from the Municipal Party Headquarters inviting him to return, he left Europe last month and took the French postal ship "Da Daneng". It was originally scheduled to arrive at the port at 6:00 AM yesterday, but due to the heavy fog in the morning, the ship stopped at the Songkou port. The fog cleared at around 8:00 AM, and the ship entered the port and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's central warehouse pier at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Welcome from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Representatives from various agencies and organizations in the city arrived at the port around 7:00 AM to welcome him. They included Wu Kaixian from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lu Jingshi from the Garrison Headquarters, Wang Xiaolai from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lin Kanghou from the Bankers Association, Wang Keyong and Ding Shoutang from the Municipal Education Bureau, Zhu Xuefan from the General Labor Union, and Tao's relatives and friends Tao Guangchuan, Zhang Zixiao, Wu Zhengjue, Liu Xianzhu, Zhang Xiaotong, Hu Xingyao, Wang Manyun, and Chen Jicheng, as well as Sun Yucai, Yuan Dingchang, and Liu Meiyi, representatives from the Jingye Middle School Alumni Association, and more than 200 other people. After the ship docked, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, including Wu Kaixian, Lu Jingshi, and Zhu Xuefan, first boarded the ship to talk with Tao about their separation. They then disembarked together, shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one, and expressed their gratitude before leaving the port and getting into a car to return to his private residence on Mei Baige Road.</p>
<p>Tao's Speech</p>
<p>Tao told reporters on the ship that the political reforms and active war preparations in various European and American countries show their ambition to dominate the world. He went on to say that when he was in Berlin, he attended the World Games and hoped that the country should actively promote sports even more.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Various Industries to Settle Accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival; Money Trade and Banking Industries Increasingly Busy with Collections; Preparations Underway to Securely Pass the End of October <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The settlement period for Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors at the end of September (Mid-Autumn Festival) is approaching rapidly. Factories, companies, and shops are distributing bills to all customers and sending people to collect payments. The funds collected are being deposited into banks and money shops. Therefore, the money trade and banking industries are becoming increasingly busy with collections. Because various industries are aware of the sluggish market, most transactions are in cash. Loans are only given to those with good credit. Therefore, the amount of bad debts is less than in previous years. It is expected that no unfortunate events will occur during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival. At the same time, the money trade and banking industries are being particularly cautious about various credit loans. Therefore, it is certain that the end of autumn will be safely passed without incident. All member banks and money shops of the Bankers Association and the Money Trade Association will be closed for one day on September 3rd. Furthermore, the long-term loan period for the end of October for the money trade is also approaching. Money shops have begun to contact various factories, shops, and companies that have borrowed money to discuss extensions and repayments. As for new loans, they will be negotiated after the end of September. Since various industries are fully prepared, it is said that no problems will occur when the period arrives.</p>

<h3 id="e84">National Products Maintenance Association Sends Telegram to Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Requesting Negotiations to Cancel Oppressive Taxation by Vietnam <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Products Maintenance Association sent a message to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, "Regarding Vietnam's oppressive taxation of Chinese goods entering the country, requesting negotiations with France to promptly reduce the tax and safeguard our national relations: We, the Association, have recently received a letter from Huang Jianzhong, the representative of the Vietnamese Chinese National Products Company's Shanghai office (original letter omitted), etc. Based on this, the Sino-French Vietnamese trade treaty was supposed to regulate the import of Chinese goods into Vietnam after its promulgation and implementation, promoting trade smoothly. However, only one year after the treaty was signed, Vietnam has imposed on Chinese goods tax rates that are higher than those paid by its own citizens or those of any other country. This violates the Sino-French Vietnamese customs treaty and disregards Chinese sovereignty, which is extremely evident. Moreover, our consul in Saigon has remained silent, ignoring the suffering of Chinese merchants. What is his duty? In order to maintain the export of national products, the Association deems it appropriate to respectfully submit this matter. We humbly request that Your Excellency promptly engage in serious negotiations with France and order our consul in Saigon to protest vigorously to the Vietnamese government based on reason, to achieve the goal of canceling the oppressive tax in accordance with the treaty, thereby strengthening the relations between the two countries. We await your instructions with great urgency and for the sake of the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Zhang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs."</p>

<p>Since the Japanese Navy's attitude towards the Chengdu, Beihai, and Hankou incidents suddenly became strong, Japanese officials stationed in Shanghai have been very busy. A reporter from the Dagon News Agency learned from the Japanese Embassy that Sato, the naval attaché who accompanied Ambassador Kawagoe to Nanjing, and Assistant Officer Okino suddenly returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 21st at around 6:00 PM on a China National Aviation Corporation plane due to the tense situation in Shanghai. That evening, they met with Commander of the Third Fleet Okawa to discuss the actions that the navy should take, and the meeting did not end until late at night. Sato is now returning to Nanjing to report to Kawagoe, so he returned to Nanjing last night. Taji, the first secretary of the Japanese Embassy, entered Nanjing on the evening of the 21st to consult with Kawagoe, and returned to Shanghai last night to discuss everything with Consul General Wakasugi. Nammoto, the head of the special service, entered Nanjing last night to meet with Army Attaché Kita Seiichi and Assistant Officer Momiyama to discuss matters.</p>

You expressed optimism about China's future.</p>

They do not have a group organization and are often bullied, which is pitiful. Our association has repeatedly discussed ways to protect them, but since they are far away in Japan, we feel that we are unable to reach them. Although we have publicly recommended Mr. Gu Ruibao to serve as a representative of our association to pay attention to comforting them at any time, we are deeply afraid that there may be omissions. Therefore, we ask the ambassador to examine the situation and order the consuls in various places in Japan to provide practical protection whenever there are matters involving negotiations. We would be deeply grateful. Respectfully to Xu, the Ambassador of the Republic of China to Japan, Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Association of Shanghai, humbly."</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministries of Transportation and Finance, stating: According to the Ministry of Military Affairs' report No. 310 on September 15, 1936, which was based on a report from Gu Zheng Lun of the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and a report from Zheng Zhi, Captain of the Gendarmerie Escorting Ships in the Wu River, Report No. 196 on August 13 of this year, it was stated that since the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, efforts have been made to ensure passenger safety, with designated entry and exit routes for passengers boarding and disembarking each ship, which aligns with Article 1 of the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 843 on February 8, which prohibits boarding ships without tickets, and with the New Life Movement. However, during my recent duty tour to various ports, the gendarmerie stationed at each port and escorting ships reported that customs and postal employees have not changed their old habits. They often do not follow designated routes when entering and exiting ports, walking arbitrarily, often colliding with passengers and obstructing traffic. The gendarmerie, as part of their duty, has politely dissuaded them, but they not only did not listen but became angry and unreasonable, with a strong and uncooperative attitude. It is difficult for the gendarmerie to serve due to the arrogant attitude of customs and postal employees and their refusal to heed advice. It is requested that you report to the Executive Yuan and instruct the customs and postal agencies in various ports to strictly require their employees to maintain order in port terminals to ensure passenger safety and facilitate the gendarmerie's duties, which is appropriate. Based on this, it has been found that customs personnel walking on and off ships in ports and failing to maintain order, leading to disputes with the gendarmerie providing guidance, has occurred more than once. Previously, it was reported that on July 21 of this year, when the Jianghua ship, traveling from Shanghai and stationed in Hankou, arrived in Nanjing, customs officers led five search team members and one patrol officer to investigate over ten pieces of smuggled goods. After the inspection was completed, they disembarked from the entrance, and the gendarmerie, seeing that it violated the regulations of the China Merchants Bureau and the New Life Movement, advised them to use the designated entry and exit routes, but the customs officers, relying on their power, refused to listen, leading to a dispute. On July 21 of the same year, when the Jiangshun ship sailed down to Shanghai, customs personnel did not follow the "left up, right down" route and boarded where passengers were disembarking. The gendarmerie stepped forward to dissuade them, but the customs officers refused to comply, leading to another dispute. Although it is legitimate for customs officers to perform their duties for convenience, all levels of public officials should earnestly implement regulations, especially when the China Merchants Bureau has just been reformed and the New Life Movement is being actively promoted. The captain's request is appropriate. It is appropriate to report to your office and request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministries of Transportation and Finance to instruct the postal and customs employees in various ports to comply with the order of port terminals to maintain the New Life Movement. Based on this, it has been found that the commander's request is a factual situation and should be reported to your office for review and implementation. Based on this, it should be approved. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order requires your ministry to instruct the post offices (customs) in various ports to strictly enforce the regulations and instruct all employees to comply. This order.</p>

<p>The Datongxing Shipping Company's Hesun ship, after sailing to Tianjin, the company received a telegram from the ship yesterday, stating that upon arriving in the port of Tianjin at Xiaosunzhuang, it encountered the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Northern China passenger ship Fusheng, which was departing from Tianjin. As the water surface was narrow, the Hesun ship, fearing a dangerous situation, urgently maneuvered outward to avoid it. The Fusheng ship passed safely, but two wooden boats used for engineering by the Tianjin River and Sea Engineering Bureau were moored there. During the Hesun ship's avoidance maneuver, the two boats were mistakenly damaged. Details will be provided in a separate report by the captain.</p>

<p>The Dagon Society reports that the Zhejiang Local Bank, in order to regulate local finance, plans to issue 8 million yuan in subsidiary currency. Zhu Kongyang was sent to Shanghai to visit Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to request approval, citing the precedent of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Minister Kong expressed approval in principle for the issuance of subsidiary currency. However, given the relationship of this matter to overall financial policy, the amount of issuance, and the concrete measures for preparation, the Ministry of Finance must give careful consideration before approval. The bank's requested amount is excessive. To accommodate the needs of the financial market and avoid impacting the legal tender policy, the total amount of future issuance must be reduced. Zhu has returned to report to the bank, so the realization of this matter is still pending.</p>

At the same time, efforts are being made to balance provincial government revenue and expenditure by abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. All matters are being actively promoted.</p>

<p>Since Hong Fumei took over as manager of the Zhengtai Xinyi Rubber Factory on Dalian Wan Road, the internal organization has been greatly rectified, showing a vigorous atmosphere. Business is also growing daily. In addition to striving for production, the factory has also established a labor children's school, a sports department, and a factory doctor, so labor and management are very harmonious. Its famous product, the Warrior brand Wanli shoes, has been registered and patented with the Trademark Bureau. The product is of good quality and low price, and it is popular throughout the country. Schools and military training organizations in both local and foreign areas purchase from the factory. Recently, an industrial rubber factory, seeing that the Warrior brand Wanli shoes are selling widely, has been infringing on the factory's trademark to deceive customers. Upon learning of this, the factory, in addition to sending a letter through lawyer Xu Yannian to the industrial rubber factory, demanding that it be discontinued, has also published a public notice in the newspaper to customers in various ports to purchase genuine Warrior brand Wanli shoes.</p>

<p>Yunnan is adjacent to the capital city of Yangon, the summer government moves to Maymyo (on a high mountain, 3,340 feet above sea level, with a very cool climate). Our country has consulates, chambers of commerce, schools, guild halls, etc. in Yangon. The total population of Myanmar is 14,647,493, of which 193,594 are overseas Chinese (of the overseas Chinese in Yangon, there are 30,622). (The capital of Myanmar is Mandalay, the last of its capital cities, because the Burmese king's territory was captured by the British on November 28, 1885, and he was exiled to the coast of Mumbai, and the country perished. The most numerous overseas Chinese are Yunnanese and Fujianese, followed by Cantonese. The Yunnanese mostly deal in Sichuan yellow and white silk, jade, and other businesses, while the Fujianese mostly deal in mountain goods, grains, and so on. It is said that many Fujianese have</p>
<p>settled in Myanmar, opening shops in various mountain areas (i.e., villages), marrying U Tao women (i.e., Burmese women) as wives, and often lending funds to local farmers during spring plowing, to be repaid in cash or discounted grain at harvest time, at extremely high interest rates. The Taishan Cantonese mostly run taverns and pawnshops (pawnshops operate in the same way as taverns). In addition, overseas Chinese in Yangon often open shops, using small profits to absorb local indigenous funds to establish businesses and run pawnshops in the interior. Many wealthy overseas Chinese in Myanmar have also opened rice mills and machine factories. Furthermore, in my general observations in India, there is no shortage of wealthy merchants, with some individuals owning two or three large-scale hemp factories and packaging plants, or also possessing porcelain factories, light bulb factories, etc. Normally,</p>
<p>they store millions of goods and raw materials without relying on bank loans. The young people are also very active, and industry is gradually developing. In addition, there is a group of people in India, the Madrasis from the south, indigenous people called Jining, who specialize in labor, and another group called Meng Hua, who control the reins of commerce throughout India, and another group of Qizhi people, who specialize in lending money at high interest rates, like the Shanghai custom of having usurious loans. Currently, the national goods that our country ships to Southeast Asia are mostly daily necessities needed by overseas Chinese, occasionally shipped from Hong Kong, but they are mostly national goods produced by machine in Fujian and Guangdong. Recently, there has been some activity, such as cotton fabrics, undershirts, or leather bags. As for Tibet, which borders India, each person must have</p>
<p>a delicate porcelain rice bowl, which must be a Chinese product. These goods are now shipped by overseas Chinese to Kolkata, and Tibetans come to Kolkata to purchase them. Currently, for the various kinds of porcelain needed by our country, the porcelain manufacturers in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, are shortsighted and do not know how to cater to other people's psychology, improve their products, and accept orders. Taking a set of teacups as an example, they sell very well in Southeast Asia, but if their style is slightly changed, no one will accept them. In my opinion, the Ministry of Industry of our country should work with the Construction Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Government to find ways to improve the goods. Recently, I heard that Du Chongyuan has been released from prison and is continuing to run the Guangda Porcelain Company. In this case, the above-mentioned things can certainly be handled by the company. I have now given a rambling report,</p>
<p>which has taken up a lot of time. In short, there is great hope for the promotion of national goods overseas, especially in Southeast Asia. Not only are overseas Chinese welcoming national goods, but the local indigenous people are also very welcoming. However, I hope that national goods manufacturers will constantly study the customs, climate, and habits of various parts of Southeast Asia to improve their products. For example, silk fabrics in Southeast Asia need to be especially soft and thin, because they are located in the tropics, and this is necessary. I also have some unfulfilled intentions, believing that in addition to promoting national goods abroad, we should also enable the products produced by our overseas Chinese with capital and labor to be shipped back to our country for sale, so that the economy can be revitalized. To do this, we must immediately organize an agency for import and export trade, which should be of the greatest concern to people at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday issued a reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the issue of stamp use, stating: I have read the song code and checked the workbooks issued by factories to workers for recording, the work reports copied by workers to factories at the end of the month, and the daily absenteeism and overtime registration forms used by factories. All are used to assess worker performance and have the same purpose as setting up sign-in, leave, and attendance books. Naturally, there is no need to use stamps. However, if there is a record of wages in the absenteeism and overtime registration form and it is compiled into a book using loose-leaf pages, it should still be handled according to the book rules.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified all industry associations in the city, stating: Greetings. According to the letter from the General Bureau for the Production and Sale of Party and National Flags, the Shanghai Municipal Party and National Flag Promotion Committee has stipulated measures for the promotion of Party and National Flags in Shanghai. Since the promotion in the urban area, fortunately, the shops and residents in the city have been able to deeply understand the righteousness and enthusiastically purchase and prepare the flags. Now the urban area has been largely popularized and has temporarily come to an end. However, the division of regions in the concession special zone makes the promotion work particularly difficult. We believe that residents of the concession also belong to the Republic of China, and the use of Party and National Flags should be uniform to show national dignity and enhance international visibility, which is of great and far-reaching significance to our national spirit. On July 9 of this year, the anniversary of the revolutionary army's oath to launch the Northern Expedition, wherever the boundary between the Chinese and concession areas belonged to municipal jurisdiction, every household hung flags to celebrate, while the concession area was completely lacking. The same Chinese people have this畸形phenomenon, which not only makes foreigners laugh but also exposes weaknesses, which is very regrettable. The National Day and President Chiang's 50th birthday are coming soon. All our citizens should purchase and hang uniform Party and National Flags to show consistency and express respect for the Party-state's love for the leader. Our bureau is ordered to produce and sell flags, and we should work hard to promote them to fulfill our responsibilities. However, with limited power and ability, we rely on multi-faceted assistance to be successful. We hereby ask your association to provide assistance in the promotion of Party and National Flags within the special zone, persuade merchants and people to purchase and hang them uniformly to comply with regulations, and also notify the industry associations to stipulate effective measures to assist in the promotion, so that it is easier to popularize.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Autumn Cocoon Cocoonage Too High: All Industries Dare Not Buy, Especially Zhejiang Road Is Inferior: Request Change of Standards <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After the National Economic Commission stipulated the standard price of autumn cocoons, the silk control agencies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces followed the order. Silk manufacturers requested a change, but were not accepted. After the cocoon firms opened the weighing scale, they did not dare to buy in large quantities due to the excessive cocoonage. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Change: Cocoon Price Is Not Accurate</p>
<p>The Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission stipulated the cocoon price standard for autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. According to the New York and Yokohama futures converted into national currency, the average price of silk was set at 670 yuan per dan, and cocoonage work was set at 80 yuan per dan, and cocoon purchasing and drying expenses were 26 yuan. Drying loss was 290 catties, and the cocoon price was calculated according to the size of the cocoonage. For example, if the cocoonage is 460 catties, then each city dan of fresh cocoons is 29 yuan. If the cocoonage is 500 catties, then each city dan of fresh cocoons is 26 yuan. The silk manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in view of the current export price of Chinese silk being 600 yuan and the domestic sales being 620 yuan, which is 60 to 70 yuan different from the 670 yuan set by the Economic Commission, requested a change in history, but were rejected.</p>
<p>Poor Autumn Cocoon Harvest: Reduced Collection Amount</p>
<p>After the autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were put on the market, all silk factories and surplus cocoon merchants approved and registered by the silk control agencies of the two provinces borrowed from banks and money shops to issue purchases. Autumn cocoons in Zhejiang, Hai Ning, Shuang Lin, Tongxiang, Jiaxing, and other places have had poor harvests due to withered mulberry leaves and weather conditions, and the cocoons are of poor quality. Its cocoonage is more than 900 catties. If purchased according to the standard cocoon price, it will inevitably be costly, so each cocoon firm does not dare to buy in large quantities. At the same time, some silk manufacturers would rather use up the cocoon purchasing expenses than open the scale to buy.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the sea surface from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Haizhou is full of shoals and hidden reefs, the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, in order to facilitate the navigation industry, carried out sounding this year. The sounding project is divided into two parts: hydrographic and coastal. Most of the coastline survey has been completed, and the hydrographic sounding will begin soon. However, because the coastline is hundreds of miles long and sparsely populated, the work is very inconvenient. The bureau plans to complete all the work within next year, and will soon send a survey ship to carry out the initial sounding. After the initial sounding is completed, it will be re-measured, and then a hydrographic blueprint will be drawn up based on the sounding results for reference by the navigation industry. The section of the waterway has no accurate nautical chart, so the navigation industry regards it as a daunting task, which greatly affects the development of all industries along the coast.</p>

<p>Qiu Mingzhu from Xinghua used to live in the countryside, cultivating the fields. Qiu has a younger sister named Longnu, who is 21 years old this year. In the past, she was betrothed to a local man named Wei through a matchmaker. Unexpectedly, Longnu suddenly disappeared, and it has been six years since then, with no trace after searching everywhere. Because the Wei family is urging her to marry, Qiu led his younger brother Minghua to Shanghai, renting a residence at No. 52 Xiangcun Lane, Qu Zhenren Road, Nanshi (pulling a cart in the city during the day to make a living, but still paying attention to finding his sister in his spare time. For several months, there has been no news. Until the evening of the day before yesterday, Chen Guangfa (29 years old) from Yancheng came to Qiu's house to visit. Qiu, who was not acquainted with him, became suspicious. When Qiu extended an invitation to talk with each other, he learned that Chen Guangfa had married Longnu, and Chen was also looking for his suddenly disappeared wife for many days, but there was no trace. He then learned that Longnu had two brothers pulling carts in Shanghai and came to inquire about the whereabouts of his runaway wife. Qiu said that his sister had disappeared in the village six years ago, and he had sent out scouts everywhere, but there was no clue. Now, a brother-in-law suddenly came here, and the situation was even more suspicious. After negotiating with him, Chen also suspected that his wife was hidden by Qiu, and the two sides had a big conflict. After persuasion, they avoided the dispute. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the day before yesterday, Chen suddenly reported to the local police, who took Qiu Mingzhu and his sister Longnu, as well as the related Wang A'er, Chen Xu's, Xu Desheng, Wen Daoming, and other men and women, six people in total, along with Chen Guangfa, to the station road police station under the jurisdiction, and transferred them to the Ximen Branch. Qiu then accused Chen of abducting his sister, and Chen accused Qiu of hiding his wife. The bureau once interrogated them, and because the statements of both parties were different and the case was disjointed, they ordered a written statement to be submitted to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Wu Zhuxian, a local resident of No. 79 Xinling Village, Caishi Road, Xujiahui Road intersection, French Concession, aged 31, engaged a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Court, accusing Liu Zhongxian, a local resident of No. 9 Senlin Lane, Hele Li, Jupolai Road, currently employed at the Shanghai Municipal Council’s testing department, of fraud. The complaint stated that the plaintiff and defendant were originally classmates. On April 21st of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the plaintiff needed to exchange a land title deed. At that time, the defendant claimed to have a good friend named Yao Shengcai who worked at the Land Bureau and could arrange the exchange for a fee of 500 yuan. The plaintiff believed him and handed over 500 silver dollars to the defendant to handle the matter. However, two years have passed without any response. Despite repeated urgings, the defendant avoided meeting him, leaving the plaintiff with no choice but to file a lawsuit. After receiving the complaint, the court repeatedly scheduled hearings, but the defendant failed to appear, hindering the progress of the trial. The court ordered a temporary suspension of the trial, pending the arrest and interrogation of the defendant Liu Zhongxian. Last Saturday, the plaintiff unexpectedly encountered Liu on the street and immediately brought him to the Second Special District Court, requesting his detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huan-ying presided over the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff recounted the previous events. The defendant Liu Zhongxian stated that the 500 yuan had been handed over to Yao Shengcai, who was no longer in Shanghai, and that he himself had not appropriated the money. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered the defendant to provide a guarantor with 1,000 yuan security or 500 yuan in cash as bail, and postponed the hearing to the 29th to locate Yao Shengcai for further questioning.</p>

Recently, Wang Xu Shi filed a lawsuit in the local court seeking a divorce from her husband, Wang Fufu, claiming that her husband did not engage in honest work, was addicted to gambling, and had pawned all their possessions. Furthermore, he subjected her to physical abuse. On one occasion, she suffered contusions, leading to a reprimand from the police. Upon returning home, he locked the door and beat her with a wooden stick. Because she screamed, he inhumanely shoved a handful of salt into her lower body, causing serious injury, for which he was prosecuted by the prosecutor's office. Unable to endure living together, she requested a divorce, as well as 1,000 yuan for living expenses and 200 yuan for medical expenses. Yesterday, Judge Wang Ke-yi held a court hearing. The defendant claimed that his wife was lacking in womanly virtues and had made false accusations, and that he did not wish to divorce and requested to live together. The court declared the debate in this case concluded and set the pronouncement of judgment for the 28th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Buddhist Association Fails Twice to Take Over Longhua Temple <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: Since the Shanghai Buddhist Association removed the former abbot Yuanzhao from Longhua Temple due to an incident two years ago, and appointed the monk Xingkong as the new abbot to take over, it was later discovered that Yuanzhao had embezzled and sold temple property. The new abbot Xingkong then filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court. Once the lawsuit began, disputes arose repeatedly. Following the court's investigation, it was determined that Yuanzhao's embezzlement and sale of temple property was indeed true, and he was sentenced to imprisonment. From then on, the dispute subsided somewhat.</p>
<p>Two changes of abbot: In March of this year, the new abbot Xingkong resigned. The temple then independently elected the monk Yuanming as his successor. Now, the Shanghai Buddhist Association believes that Yuanming's succession as abbot of the temple was not the result of the Association's election and is therefore legally non-compliant. Therefore, the Association specially requested the director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Baojing, to serve as the abbot of the temple. The Association sent personnel to take over the temple on the morning of the day before yesterday. However, the temple refused to hand over the temple, and after holding the matter until 4 p.m., they returned together without results.</p>
<p>Takeover fails: At 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Association sent personnel to take over the temple again. In order to make it easier for the temple to comply, the chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Yuanying, directors Dabei, Yuanchen, Huikai, Zhenkong, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Zhen, Guan Jiongzhi, Qu Wenliu, etc., escorted Baojing to the temple. At around 4 p.m., they arrived at the temple. Because no responsible monks were present at the temple, it was still impossible to complete the handover by 6 p.m. It was decided to return to the association first and then determine a method for taking over the temple.</p>

<p>The Customs Lianxing patrol ship was patrolling the waters 300 li outside Yushan Port in Wusongkou at around 5 p.m. on the 20th when it discovered the Jinshunxing, a Ningbo fishing boat, sailing into port at high speed.

The group planned to transport the goods to Yushan and then transfer them to Shanghai for sale. The ship escorted the entire ship, cargo, and six people, including the captain Wang Apin, to port. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The customs authorities consider this the first time a large amount of smuggled goods has been intercepted since the smuggling problem arose, and they are taking it very seriously. They have ordered the seized rayon and sugar to be confiscated and handed over to the government. The fishing boat used to transport smuggled goods should be detained pending disposal. The six crew members have been handed over to the Water Police for strict interrogation.</p>

<p>Yu Zhaolin, a local resident, 24 years old, residing at No. 76 Wufu Road, Pudong, had been unemployed for a long time and asked relatives and friends for help finding a job, but to no avail. A man named Lin Renhe from Gaoyou, over 70 years old, who ran a small teahouse near Yu's residence, learned of Yu's plight. He falsely claimed to Yu's wife that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession had a watchman's job available and that he could introduce him, but it required a "sports fee" of 100 yuan. Yu's wife told her husband, who believed it to be true, and scraped together 86 yuan in three installments last month and gave it to Lin to handle the matter. However, more than a month has passed without any news. Yu became anxious and realized he had been deceived. Yesterday, he brought Lin to the Second Team of the Yangjing District Security Corps to investigate. Team leader Zhang Haigen immediately confronted the two parties. Lin suddenly claimed that the money was borrowed from Yu. Team leader Zhang determined that the matter involved allegations of fraud and obtaining property, and ordered him to be sent to the Pudong Sub-bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Xia Danianzi, a native of Funing, Jiangbei, 29 years old, earned a living pulling a rickshaw. He lived with his parents, wife, and two children in a thatched shed at No. 85 East Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, living a life of poverty. Xia's wife, unable to endure the hardship, ran away with her lover. Xia suffered this family misfortune, and his father, seeing the miserable state of his son, died suddenly from anger. Xia Danianzi, suffering this succession of misfortunes, became dazed all day. Seeing his elderly mother and young children above and below, his heart was stimulated and broken, and he fell seriously ill. He also deliberately reduced his food intake, and died yesterday. Because no one claimed his body, the police station ordered the community security officer Li Shunlin to report the death to the Local Court for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Hunan Steamboat, En Route from Tianjin to Shanghai, Female Passenger Wang Xiuchuan Jumps into the Sea, Shipowner Reports Letter, Photo, and Luggage to British Consulate, Transmitting to Municipal Government <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The British Taikoo Yanghang Hunan steamboat had a Chinese female passenger jump into the sea at 0:56 a.m. on September 2nd, en route from Tianjin to Shanghai. The ship immediately turned around and searched the vicinity for a long time, but her body could not be found. After investigation, it was determined that the passenger's name was Wang Xiuchuan, from Tianjin to Shanghai, approximately 30 years old, married, but her husband's name and address were unknown. A photo was found in her luggage, which is believed to be an image of the deceased herself, as well as a letter addressed to Dou Xiafei, with the words "Mr. Dou, please open" written on the envelope. The original text of the suicide note reads: "Beiping is also where I (original text as "brother") used to live. The bitterness of not being able to go is difficult to express in one or two words. I am neither happy to return north, nor willing to stay south. Thinking of the past, there was more suffering than happiness. The future is dim, with thousands of sorrows and myriad anxieties. I am disheartened and pessimistic with everything in life. My heart is broken. I am grateful for your love and affection, your warm sincerity. I can only regret meeting you too late and hope to repay you in the next life. I hope you will understand and not take it to heart. Please take care of yourself and be optimistic. I pray for this. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Xiafei for his perusal, Xiuchuan" (sealed below with a seal bearing the inscription "Jingxiu"). From this, it can be inferred that the deceased's suicide by jumping into the sea was a deliberate act born of deep sorrow. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the shipowner immediately sent the deceased's suicide note, photo, net basket, and two boxes to the British Consulate, reporting everything. British Consul Biyuehan, after receiving the report, immediately sent the above items to the Municipal Government of this city to report the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Speculation on Reason for Suicide of Ringleader of Poison Trafficking Ring, Police Do Not Believe Coercion, Suspect Suicide Pact <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Damei Evening News reports: The internal organs of the French citizen Shi Taishi, the leader of the poison trafficking ring who committed suicide out of fear of punishment, were examined today (22nd) by the testing laboratory of the French Municipal Council. The results of the examination have not yet been released as of this afternoon. The Criminal Court of the French Consulate had originally scheduled to examine Shi's body this morning, but it has been postponed because the testing laboratory has not yet submitted its report. The French police are still investigating Shi's whereabouts after his escape. According to police officials, even if they could find his hiding place, they would probably not be able to find any important clues in this case, because Shi must have destroyed all documents before committing suicide. The police also do not believe the theory that Shi's death was caused by someone forcing him to take poison in order to silence him. Shi's remains are still at the Guangci Hospital, and no relatives have come forward to claim them. The date of the funeral has not yet been determined. It is suspected that Shi's suicide was in accordance with the internal code of the poison trafficking ring, to die rather than face a public trial if discovered. It is noted that the ringleader of the group, Brandestette, also hanged himself on a ship after the case was exposed.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Robbery of Public Bus in Southern Shanghai, Six Bandits Arrested <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 8 p.m. on the 7th of this month, a public bus in Southern Shanghai was driving near Luban Road and Kangqu Road when it was suddenly boarded by bandits disguised as passengers. All passengers, drivers, ticket sellers, etc., suffered losses. Since the incident occurred, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered all departments to conduct strict investigations in order to apprehend and bring the perpetrators to justice. After extensive inquiries and investigations, Liu Guangjun, the captain of the Ximen Detective Division, learned that the bandits were hiding in Room 48 of the Ningxing Hotel on Ningxing Street near the Dashijie in the French Concession. After reporting to his superiors, he immediately led his team and, in cooperation with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Police Department, rushed to the scene at 6 a.m. yesterday, where they arrested six bandits: Sun Zhiliang, Jin Miaoxing, Hu Yifei (alias Ding Hongcai), Qi Yucai, Cai Yongsheng, and Song Quanqing. They were taken to the police station for temporary detention, pending their transfer to the Second Special District Court by the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Another reporting investigator reported that the Detective Division of the West Dou Public Security Sub-bureau received a confidential tip at 6 a.m. yesterday that bandits were hiding in Rooms 48 and 49 of the Ningxing Hotel at No. 479, Min Tini Yin Road, Aiduya Road, French Concession. The team dispatched detectives and requested assistance from the special unit of the French Police Department, sending Chinese and foreign detectives to Room 48 of the Ningxing Hotel, where they arrested Jin Miaoxing (36 years old), a local resident, and Ding Hongfan, also known as Wu Yifei (25 years old, a ticket collector at the Xinguang Theater). They arrested Qi Yuelin (22 years old), a Shandong native, and Wang Longdi (22 years old), a prostitute from Huzhou, in Room 49. However, no handguns or weapons were found during a search of the two rooms. They were taken back to the police station. It was discovered that Jin Miao had previously been sentenced to six years' imprisonment by the First Special District Court for a theft case and was temporarily detained. They were then transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the hearing. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the police department, explained the case and requested a postponement. The investigator of the Ximen Public Security Sub-bureau reported that the defendants were related to a robbery case on Luban Road and that the transfer documents could not be processed in time, requesting a postponement. He also stated that three more people had been apprehended since the defendants were arrested and were currently at the police station. After reviewing the report, the court questioned the defendants. It was determined that the fourth defendant, Wang Longdi, was a prostitute who had met Qi Yuelin in the Dashijie the night before and shared a room with him, and was not significantly related to the case. Wang Longdi was ordered to provide a suitable guarantor, and those without guarantors were detained. The remaining defendants were remanded in custody and the hearing was postponed to the afternoon of the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Taxpayers Association Letters Shanghai Municipal Council, Requests Compassionate Aid for Shen Ruting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Taxpayers Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: To whom it may concern, we have received a letter from the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, stating that member Shen Ruting reported in his letter that he entered the Fourth Ma Road Fire Brigade at the age of 28, Western name Shen Ating, also known as Tu Kang, number 59, and was later transferred to the Yangshupu Fire Brigade, where he has served until the age of 51. He has continued his firefighting work for over 20 years. Whenever there is a fire, he bravely goes forward without any mistakes. On January 20th of this year, the electric light factory on Yangshupu Road, Lan Road, suddenly reported a fire. Ruting, as his duty demanded, immediately went to extinguish it. Unexpectedly, the current overflowed, and he was severely injured. Although he received treatment and managed to survive, his limbs are bent, and his face is scorched. He has become disabled. The Westerners at the association, considering him a disabled employee who cannot continue to work, have only agreed to subsidize his original salary for one and a half years before terminating his employment. Thinking of the long days ahead, and a family of old and young to feed, how can he survive on such a small subsidy? He earnestly requests the authorities to provide compassionate aid and allow him to receive his original salary for five years, along with all his savings over the years, paid in one lump sum, to support him for the rest of his years. He would be immensely grateful. Upon investigation, Shen Ruting was disabled in the line of duty, a truly pitiful situation. The requested five years of salary is not excessive. Attached is a copy of the letter for your reference. Accordingly, we request the council to uphold justice and appeal on his behalf. It is hoped that you will investigate, etc. It has come to our attention that Shen Ruting is so brave, loyal to his duties, and disabled in the line of duty. The aid he receives is only one and a half years of his original salary. Compared to recent retirees, who have served for fewer years than Shen, the benefits they receive are many times greater in proportion. The disparity is obvious. We request that the council grant him the satisfaction he desires, as an encouragement, and advise that from now on, the council should treat its employees equally, regardless of nationality. Although there may be differences in salaries, such as pensions, savings, etc., the methods should be uniform. Do not let disparities permanently exist, in order to show the permanence of justice and the elimination of bias. Based on the above, we are sending this letter, hoping that you will investigate, and in addition to providing Shen Ruting with compassionate aid, readjust the retirement procedures for council members, for your attention. Addressed to Secretary-General of Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>

<p>On the night of the 18th of this month, the house of Ye Rongsheng, a resident of the third district of Chuansha County in Pudong, was suddenly invaded by a gang of armed robbers. They looted valuables, fired shots as a show of force, and injured the victim, Ye Rongsheng, before fleeing with the stolen goods. Upon receiving the report, the local Public Security Bureau ordered the detective team to investigate and pursue the criminals. They arrested four suspects, one of whom, Cao Mingshan, was found to be carrying a handgun. When questioned, he confessed that the gun was given to him by his father, Zhou Jigen, a native of Changzhou, who runs the Mingle Garden teahouse near Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai. The day before yesterday, the detective team leader brought Zhou, the suspect, to Shanghai and requested assistance from the Putuo Road Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the address, but they found no one there. Later, according to Cao, Zhou often went to the Zhongxing Teahouse at 1221 Robison Road for tea. Chinese and foreign detectives then went to Zhongxing and finally arrested Zhou. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Chuan Lin conducted the preliminary hearing. First, Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, explained the circumstances of the police station's assistance in arresting Zhou. Then, the detective team leader of the Chuansha Public Security Bureau presented an official letter requesting permission to extradite Zhou for trial and punishment. When questioned, Zhou Jigen's testimony was evasive. After the interrogation, Judge Fu ordered Zhou to be handed over to the detective team leader to be taken away for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Depraved Youth Turns Thief: Li Zhiting Sentenced to Eight Months <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhiting, a 24-year-old youth from Shaoxing, recently became unemployed and associated with thieves. He stayed in small inns, was naturally violent, and often got into fights, which was despised by relatives and friends, resulting in his clothes being pawned and looking like a beggar. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at 2:30 PM, he sneaked to the vicinity of Guangxin Road in Yangshupu and saw that the infant held by a local woman, He Qiu, had a gold bell worth eight yuan on its wrist. He went forward and used a blade to cut the bell off and ran away. The woman shouted "Robber!" and Detective Liu Changgen heard the call and arrived, helping to chase and capture him, finding the stolen goods on him. He was taken to the Yangshupu Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexun continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that no other cases were found during the adjournment and that he had been involved in fights with others before. Judge Xiao sentenced Li Zhiting to eight months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Minfeng Company: Domestic Cigarette Paper Production and Sales Statistics After Creating Cigarette Paper <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, cigarettes are one of the most consumed items in our country. For years, the paper used to manufacture cigarettes has relied on imports, resulting in significant leakage of funds. Since Zhu Meixian and Jin Runxiang of Minfeng Paper Company started creating this cigarette paper, they have purchased machinery and received exclusive manufacturing rights from the Ministry of Industry. They started shipping products several months ago, and their quality is comparable to imported goods, with sales becoming popular domestically. It is said that Minfeng originally ordered two sets of cigarette paper machines. However, since this machine was a new invention in the country, for the sake of caution, only one set was shipped first. Each machine can produce 1,250 rolls per day, totaling 420,000 rolls per year. The two machines can produce a total of 840,000 rolls per year. Compared with the domestic demand at the time, the supply and demand were corresponding. However, in recent years, the market has been depressed, and various places have vigorously promoted the New Life Movement, causing people to quit smoking cigarettes, resulting in a step-by-step reduction in cigarette sales. According to the statistics of the Cigarette Tax Bureau, in the first half of this year, the actual number of cigarettes manufactured by various cigarette factories in the country was 354,178 boxes for foreign-owned factories and 199,558 boxes for Chinese-owned factories. Each box uses one roll of cigarette paper. Based on this calculation, excluding foreign-owned cigarette factories, only 199,558 rolls of paper are used, and only 399,116 rolls of cigarette paper are needed for the whole year. Among them, a part is still inevitably using foreign goods. Therefore, Minfeng's current production capacity of one machine has an excess of supply over demand. Therefore, Minfeng is hesitant about whether the other set of machines that has been ordered but not yet arrived should still be shipped to China. In fact, cigarettes are a consumable, and it is a very good phenomenon that Chinese people can gradually reduce smoking. It cannot be said that it is not an achievement of the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Tongyi Trust Company: Lawsuits Consolidated for Trial; Where are the 180,000 Savings Deposits? The Court Believes a Thorough Investigation is Necessary <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since Tongyi Trust Company went bankrupt on June 15th and the director and general manager, Huang Suchu, quietly left Shanghai, depositors have filed lawsuits against the company's entire board of directors and supervisors in the First Special District Local Court. Some have already had preliminary trials and judgments, some are still in trial, and some are just beginning to file lawsuits. Yesterday afternoon, the court continued to hear the case jointly filed by Lu Tangcha, Ying Shugui, and Wang Meiqing against the company's directors and supervisors for violating the Company Law. Since depositors Zhang Peiyan and Xu Xiangsun also sued the company's directors and supervisors for violating the Company Law, Judge Ye Shengchao announced after the hearing that the cases would be consolidated for trial to save time. He then ordered the plaintiffs to present evidence of their deposits for review. Among them, Lu, Ying, and Wang had deposited public debt certificates, requesting a judgment ordering repayment of more than 176,000 yuan. Zhang Peiyan's was a current deposit, plus interest, totaling more than 36,500 yuan. Xu Xiangsun was representing the organization he led and deposited more than 2,700 yuan of savings funds into the company's savings department. The lawyers representing the plaintiffs often argued that since the defendants were the directors and supervisors executing the company's business, they should be responsible for the company's actions. For example, when the company applied for registration, it stated that the capital was 2.5 million, but now it is found that the actual amount received was only 1.36 million. There was no profit in the business, but the depositors' money was transferred to distribute dividends to shareholders. All of these are violations of the Company Law. When operating savings, they should first register according to the law. The company had never complied with the Savings Bank Law to apply for registration, and requested an investigation. However, only Xu Jixun, Zhou Shouliang, Guo Yushang, and Fu Zhuyin, along with defense lawyer Xu Shihao, appeared in court. The rest, Huang Suchu, Liu Fangyuan, Liu Rensan, Neng Muzhai, and Wu Jingwen, were all in hiding and did not appear. Jiang Liuzhi still claimed illness, and a lawyer represented him in court. Judge Ye reviewed the company's balance sheet for 1935 and found that more than 180,000 yuan of savings deposits had been deposited in other banks and businesses. He questioned Xu, Zhou, Guo, and Fu about the numbers of other banks and businesses. Xu and others all said that they were not the directors who executed the business, and they never inquired about the internal affairs of the company. Although it was recorded in the table, they had never seen the detailed accounts, so they did not know. Judge Ye believed that it was necessary to thoroughly investigate the whereabouts of more than 180,000 yuan of deposits, so he adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 25th of this month for further questioning.</p>

<p>According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", on Monday night, six Japanese sailors were patrolling North Sichuan Road when several pear cores suddenly fell from a window above the entrance of a dance hall at No. 512. One of them hit a sailor's neck. The soldiers immediately surrounded the dance hall and reported it to the police station. Soon after, officers from the Japanese Marine Corps, the Dixwell Road Police Station, and the Public Security Bureau arrived one after another and went inside to inspect. The manager of the dance hall, Mr. Hu, was taken to the North Sichuan Road Public Security Bureau branch and released after a stern warning. When the military and police personnel gathered at the dance hall, a large crowd gathered outside, and the situation was very tense. Reporters and photographers from Japanese newspapers took many photos inside and outside the dance hall. After much commotion, things finally calmed down. Chinese and Japanese authorities are still investigating today (the 22nd) to determine whether the pear core that landed on the sailor's neck was accidental or intentional.</p>

<p>Edward Carow (transliteration), a Westerner, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against Gu Xinyi, the manager of the Yongda Flour Mill, a giant merchant on the sea, and the chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, for neglecting a debt of 1,000 taels. It is said that the defendant borrowed 1,000 taels of silver from the plaintiff on September 22nd, 1931, due to temporary financial difficulties. Several years have passed, and he has repeatedly urged him to no avail. He requested a judgment ordering the defendant to repay the principal and interest. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, on the morning of yesterday, summoned the case to the Seventh Civil Court by Judge Li Liang. The defendant's lawyer appeared on his behalf. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the facts of the lawsuit and requested a judgment on the subject matter, submitting the promissory note as evidence. The defendant's lawyer admitted that the defendant had borrowed 1,000 taels from the plaintiff and issued a promissory note. However, the defendant had previously ordered 8,000 dan of Saigon rice from the plaintiff, and the plaintiff later regretted it, causing the defendant to suffer a loss of 120,000 yuan, which had not yet been negotiated. He filed a lawsuit on the loan first. The court found that the defendant admitted to the debt, and the facts were clear. After ordering the lawyers of both parties to debate, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and set the judgment for the 26th.</p>

<p>Detectives from the French Concession Police Department arrested bandits Zhang Hemao, Sun Zijia, and Wang Huisheng in Caishi Street on the first month and 20th day. They confiscated a handgun and brought them to the police station, where they were sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution in accordance with the law. During the interrogation, Zhang Amao confessed that the handgun was provided by Tan Genggen (43 years old, residing at No. 10 Dayang Bridge, Zhabei, currently a local official), the father of Tan, who is currently a secretary in a certain society in Nanjing. The French Concession Police Department then dispatched detectives along with the Zhabei Public Security Bureau to arrest Tan at the address. The First Special District Court prepared a document to extradite him for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. According to Tan Genggen's confession, when he was a local official, Zhang Amao was a local hooligan. He had a grudge against Zhang for extortion, so Zhang fabricated the accusation and did not provide Zhang with a handgun to commit robbery. The court reviewed the confession and ordered Tan to provide a security deposit of 5,000 yuan and adjourned the trial to the 24th to be tried together with Zhang Amao.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Kuang Zhongmou and Wife's Debt Lawsuit: Huge Amount of Rent Seized; Totaling More Than 19,000 Yuan; Approved by the Court for Execution <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market and a wealthy merchant from Liangxi, and his elderly wife, Kuang Zeng, are both over fifty years old. Kuang Zeng once used hundreds of yuan accumulated from her hard work to invest in Kuang's business when he was still poor. Later, he became wealthy, and they settled as 20,000 yuan, and Kuang issued a passbook to his wife. To date, the principal and interest have reached more than 30,000 yuan. After the couple fell out, Kuang Zeng filed a lawsuit in the Local Court. After three trials, the final judgment was that Kuang should return the money. Not long ago, Kuang hired lawyer Zhang Shijian and others to request a retrial, which also failed. The case is now under execution. However, Kuang has never paid. The lawyer representing Kuang Zeng found that the 34 stores in the Penglai Market had originally paid a monthly rent of 20 yuan per room. Later, Kuang increased the rent by 5 yuan, which was met with dissatisfaction from the public. The tenants organized a tenant union and deposited the monthly rent in the Shanghai Bank, totaling more than 28 months, amounting to 680 yuan in national currency per month, totaling more than 22,000 yuan including interest. They requested the court to withdraw the money from the bank for execution. The court has approved it. However, the tenants only agreed to pay the original amount of 19,040 yuan. The interest should still belong to the tenants. Now that Kuang Zhongmou's money has been withdrawn, he is shouting.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Chen Jingchu and He Chengfu: Dispute Over Daughter Continues; Neither Will Relinquish Temporary Adoption; The Case Awaits Transfer to the Local Court <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jingchu, a native of Yancheng who is now an inspector at the Shanghai Education Bureau, had his wife, Wu, die of illness on July 8th last year. She left behind three children, two boys and one girl. He adopted his four-year-old daughter, Xiaofeng, to his friend He Chengfu, the dean of studies at Minli Women's High School and a professor at Qingxin Women's School, and his wife, He Qiu. Recently, Chen suddenly wanted to take back the girl. Negotiations were ineffective. Chen then filed a complaint with the French Concession Police Department, accusing the He couple of luring the child. After the police department sent investigator Zhou Bingcheng to summon the He couple for questioning, the police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court in accordance with Article 241 of the Criminal Law. Under the trial of Judge Zhang Chaozuo, he advised both parties to reconcile. However, both parties refused to give in, especially on the matter of compensation. Chen firmly refused, resulting in the breakdown of the reconciliation. Both parties wanted to take the child. The court ruled that the jurisdiction of the case was wrong and ordered the transfer to the Shanghai Local Court for handling. The girl was sent to a daycare center, and both parties were ordered to pay 50 yuan to the case. When the Shanghai Local Court determined who would take back the child, the report stated that whoever would take them back would. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang of the Second Special Court issued summonses to Chen Jingchu and He Chengfu to appear in court. He opened a special criminal court and informed both parties that the girl, Xiaofeng, was originally ordered by the court to be sent to a daycare center for care. Because the center's regulations stipulated that there were day and night classes, children in the daytime were aged two to four, and children at night were aged six months and above. Xiaofeng was already four years old and could not be kept in accordance with the regulations. So today they summoned both of you to see if you could compromise and let one party temporarily adopt the child, because the Guangci Hospital is a charitable institution and cannot keep the child in the hospital for a long time. Chen Jingchu said that he requested permission to seek security and that the child should be temporarily adopted by a third party, the child's maternal grandmother. He Chengfu said that the child had been with his family for fourteen months and was now suffering in the hospital. Moreover, the third party, the maternal grandmother, mentioned by Chen lived with Chen and was supported by Chen, so he could not let her take her away. He requested that the child still be taken back and raised by the people. The court reviewed the statements and found that both parties still refused to give in, so it ordered that the child be temporarily kept in Guangci Hospital and that the case be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for handling.</p>

<p>Han Liansheng (also known as Han Lisheng), a native of Zhenjiang, being in dire straits, rented a spare room at No. 1102, Avenue Edward VII, last month. He put up a sign for the "Gangxing Film Company" and advertised, claiming the company needed staff and trainee actors with certain monthly salaries. This attracted many unemployed people to register. Han seized the opportunity to extort money, setting the amount of the guarantee deposit based on the applicant's situation, ranging from five to thirty yuan. Within a month, the amount of money swindled was considerable. Recently, victims Sun Zhibei, Sun Lin, Qiu Xijin, Wang Pingji, Sun Zhiying, Hua Rongrong, Wu Xianqing, etc., discovered the scam and reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The police dispatched officers and arrested Han the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhan Liang conducted a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian charged Han with fraud, requesting severe punishment according to the law. Each victim was brought to court to testify about their experience of being deceived and the amount of money lost. When questioned, Han confessed to setting up a fictitious film company to fraudulently obtain guarantee deposits. Judge Zhan, after a clear investigation, ordered the defendant to be detained pending sentencing next week.</p>

<h3 id="e154">National Goods Movement: Echoes from Interviewers <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Quite by chance, we were given the opportunity to be selected as national goods movement interviewers. However, in terms of using and promoting national goods, this did not just start today.</p>
<p>From today onwards, we will take this iron burden completely onto our own shoulders, and unflinchingly embark on this arduous journey; the responsibility is significant, yet what we feel in our hearts is lightness and joy.</p>
<p>The slogan "Promote National Goods" is perhaps shouted loudly even by three-year-olds. In fact, alarming customs import statistics can often be found in newspapers, and are undeniable. Therefore, the current work of the national goods movement cannot focus solely on shouting slogans; it should be more practical, more in-depth, and grounded in reality, so that everyone has the good concept of "must use national goods."</p>
<p>We have been selected to be the outposts bearing this practical work. How could we not feel both ashamed and honored! Our work has already begun for a week.</p>
<p>In this short week, we have visited nearly twenty well-known national goods factories in this city. Although due to the urgency of time, there have not been more opportunities for discussion, under the guidance of national goods movement pioneers and the detailed instructions of enthusiastic leaders of various national goods factories, coupled with what we have gained from on-site observation, one cannot help but deeply believe that our national goods are increasingly refined. Whether in terms of quality or form, they can more than replace foreign goods.</p>
<p>1.  Raw materials and machinery: If there are national goods available, they are invariably used, and there are frequent inventions and imitations (such as the silk of the Yabu Er Electrical Factory, the filter tanks of the Tianchu MSG Factory, the machinery of the Yaguang Bakelite Factory, the raw materials for the Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Airplane Brand Pencils, and the steel skin of the Dahua Iron Factory, etc.).</p>
<p>2.  Manufacturing procedures are highly economical and hygienic (such as the success of the Zhongfa Pharmacy in imitating foreign medicines using Chinese methods, and the rationalized management of the Wuzhou Pharmacy).</p>
<p>3.  Daily necessities are all beautiful, economical, and durable (such as the fabrics of the Xin Xin Weaving Factory, the woolens of the Zhanghua Weaving Factory, the silks of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, the cotton textiles of the Sanyou Industrial Society, the Shidai Shuang Cream of the China Chemical Industrial Society, the Qiandou Brand Tooth Powder of the Family Industrial Society, and various fans of the Huasheng Electrical Factory, etc.).</p>
<p>4.  Sales are flourishing and reaching foreign countries (the business of the China National Goods Company is quite considerable. Wuhe cotton毛衫sweaters are selling well in Russia and India. The Kangyuan Canning Factory and Tianchu MSG sell 50-60% to the UK and the US. The products of Meiya, Yongxing, and the China Enamel Factory are mostly sold to Southeast Asia, Singapore, etc.).</p>
<p>These are all practical examples. No matter how eloquent one may be, how can one deny the facts? Having seen these facts, what more sufficient reasons can we have to deny the advantages of national goods, and to bear to be promoters of foreign goods, intentionally or unintentionally!</p>
<p>The factory visits of the past few days have given us rich knowledge and enhanced our love for national goods. We will more resolutely vow to be users of national goods.</p>
<p>In a few days, we will take our confidence in and love for national goods deep into the streets and alleys, to gain the confidence of general housewives and arouse their enthusiasm for using national goods.</p>
<p>Our knowledge is shallow, our experience is insufficient, and it is almost an overestimation of our abilities to attempt this work, but we believe that we will not shy away from difficulties, and we will work patiently to make the housewives our close friends. Between us, we will talk about everything from household matters to the comparison between national goods and foreign goods, as loving and using national goods is a citizen's natural duty. To achieve our goal of faithfully serving families and completing the important mission we have been entrusted with.</p>
<p>Finally, we have inexpressible gratitude for the encouragement given by the media, the enthusiastic guidance of national goods leaders, and the supervision of people from all walks of life. We can only offer our efforts in our work as a salute!</p>

<h3 id="e155">National Goods Cuisine <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>On one occasion, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Huang Renzhi, and other gentlemen gathered for dinner with gentlemen from the national goods community. Mr. Lin lamented the extravagance of banquets, believing that in this time of national crisis and the era of promoting a new lifestyle, this kind of practice should be corrected to create a new innovation for the people. Therefore, he advocated that in the future, our banquets should promote a kind of national goods cuisine to be promoted domestically as a standard. Mr. Huang was the first to agree, and everyone unanimously praised and expressed their sympathy. National goods cuisine is also called Five Lakes Four Seas cuisine, with four dishes and five bowls. The five bowls consist of four main dishes and one soup. It is both simple and practical, with the price determined by the quality of the materials. The high-end costs five yuan, the mid-range three yuan, and the low-end one or two yuan, with the total cost per person not exceeding five jiao. All the ingredients and drinks used are domestically produced, without shark fin or abalone. The needs of a feast are not costly, and the time spent can be completed in twenty or thirty minutes. This is truly worth promoting and is also worthy of being implemented. In particular, the national goods community should take the lead to popularize it in companies, shops, and factories. The effect will be swift and influential. I hope that the whole country will consider it and put it into practice! Chinese people, should know what time it is today! The national crisis is so serious, and the national situation is so degraded that it is not enough to be frugal to deal with others, and it is not enough to survive today without reducing consumption. At present, our own situation can only be to work hard to produce and restrain enjoyment. It's good to produce one point more, and it's good to enjoy a little less. Without mass production, it is not enough to be self-sufficient, and without careful enjoyment, it is not enough to establish a life and live in peace. Mr. Lu Zuofu hung a slogan in the Minsheng Company: "Produce boldly, enjoy carefully." The words are sincere and meaningful and are the words of a man of good conscience. Our advocacy of national goods cuisine is also a means of carefully enjoying in order to save the country from its plight. My patriotic compatriots, may they also know how to rise up!</p>

<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Yingfen, Lin Wen, Shen Wenxian Writer: Xu Songzi "September 18th" Three Days Later</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and the autumn season of the Municipal National Goods Year is quickly presenting itself before us again. The rustling autumn wind has already moved the various companies and commercial venues, with high-hanging banners proclaiming "Autumn Great Sale." Dazzling advertisements are already exerting their power, touching our eyes. It seems to be telling us very clearly – "Autumn has arrived."</p>
<p>Based on past experience, facts also tell us that "autumn" is a major period of climatic change in the year, and people's lives therefore urgently need to purchase all kinds of autumn supplies. Similarly, the dumping of foreign goods is precisely the most active opportunity. At this time, the influx of imported goods into our markets will again compete for novelty and difference to win their customers. What's more, the Mid-Autumn Festival is just around the corner. We can already see those batches of "foreign goods promoters" about to buy large quantities of imported cigarettes, alcohol, candies, biscuits, and canned foods! To use as gifts and embellish this great season. Here, I want to cry out loudly, hoping that Chinese people will no longer make the mistakes of the past, and no longer make the mistake of being a manufacturer of huge trade deficits in a confused state.</p>
<p>Moreover, at present, the economic crisis of the nation is already serious to this point. The dumping of foreign goods has already reached the stage of swallowing up the vitality of our entire nation, and we can no longer have illusions about "material enjoyment." This time, the Fifth National Goods Commercial Venue of Nine Factories is opening on the fifth anniversary of September 18th, using the promotion of national goods to express not forgetting the national crisis. This has great significance. I hope that every patriotic compatriot will promote and cherish it.</p>
<p>Finally, I also want to say that when the autumn season has come again in the City National Goods Year, the shuttle of time has quickly rolled away three-quarters of its days. We must always examine ourselves, regarding the achievements of the past eight months of this year, how does it compare to last year? Then, the production and sales of national goods have undoubtedly made very significant progress in recent times, especially in penetrating the interior and making great efforts to promote sales, there has been great success. Although what hinders us and requires greater efforts in the future still remains the development of transportation construction and the solution of the smuggling problem, etc. In short, the future of national goods is bright and promising, as long as we all work together, we will definitely develop to a higher and newer stage.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Our World Games Soccer Team's Performance in London: Performance Praised for Excellence <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>London Reuters News: The Chinese football team's match against the Corinthians team featured seven international amateur players. The Chinese team's performance was clear and beautiful. After the two teams stood against each other, the national anthems of both countries were played simultaneously. Before the music had even finished, the Chinese team had already opened the scoring. The Chinese team's victory in this goal, in terms of cooperation, had surprising ingenuity, thus reminding people of why the English and Chinese teams in Berlin were so unusually close and tense.</p>
<p>The first goal was scored in the twentieth minute, the center forward scoring with admirable composure. Its beauty had not been seen in years. The Chinese players shoot very well, and the technique of passing the ball is also very wonderful.</p>
<p>Corinthians won 3-2 but had exhausted their efforts. Huang Jiliang's goalkeeping was also unexpectedly good. The Chinese team scorers were Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang.</p>
<p>The Chinese team adopted the British style of attack, with the center back far behind, and the center forward advancing straight ahead. In the middle of the second half, the situation declined slightly. Before the end of the war, they launched a strong counterattack, which was a pity to be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Cai Wenli was the best fullback on the field. The Chinese team's goalkeeping performance has not been surpassed in the Haibolay this season.</p>

The second group was also won by an American athlete. Although the three Japanese athletes failed to be among the top, they were all selected.

<p>(2) Wen Diwei (USA) 1 minute 8.6 seconds</p>

However, world record holder Mastenbroek was defeated by the rising star Sun Fu, which was unexpected. However, the result did not break the old record, which was a pity. The six selected athletes were all within one arm's length of each other, and the competition was fierce. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sun Fu (Netherlands) 1 minute 18.9 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Mastenbroek (Netherlands) 1 minute 19.2 seconds</p>

<p>— Special Report by This Newspaper: Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Six, Children's Training</p>
<p>Ten minutes before class every morning, all teachers and children line up in the sports field. First, raise the national flag to the sound of the national anthem, and then perform a remote worship ceremony to the Japanese Emperor facing south. At this time, the principal and the teacher on duty may give speeches on occasional matters and other moral education matters. On Army and Navy Memorial Day, National Foundation Day, or other memorial days, staff members also give speeches or invite celebrities to give speeches. For the respected figures in Japanese history, such as General Nogi, Marshal Togo, and the Forty-Seven Loyal Retainers, lectures are also given at the prescribed times.</p>
<p>Teachers must carefully observe the children's personality, academic performance, physical condition, and the children's strengths and weaknesses, and must record them in the school register for reference in rewards or corrections. Children with excellent character and learning or those who study diligently are also commended. If a child does something particularly good or virtuous, the principal will convene all the children to the auditorium to announce the matter to the public for instruction. Admonishment and punishment will also be used when necessary.</p>
<p>Teachers also pay attention to children's service and labor training. Students in the sixth grade and above can elect representatives to assist the teacher on duty in handling the work of maintaining school discipline and hygiene. From the second grade, each grade is set up with one head and one deputy grade leader to assist in the implementation of autonomous training. The planting of the school garden and the maintenance of poultry are undertaken by students. The cleaning and tidying of the classroom are carried out by the on-duty students in rotation. In addition, the school often rewards students for diligence and thrift; and holds a thrift week to make children consciously aware of the meaning and methods of diligence and thrift and savings.</p>
<p>There are many drills for emergency gathering training in the school, and punctuality training is also encouraged. Children often go to participate in various shrines, festival days, and festival ceremonies. If a classmate dies or a classmate's parent dies, all the children in the grade will hold a memorial service to express their farewell. For the death or departure of a teacher, all students in the school will hold a memorial service or go to the wharf to see them off, expressing their respect. In the practical training of etiquette, attention is paid to the correctness of posture and the avoidance of rude language and actions. Usually, children's clothing and etiquette are carefully guided.</p>
<p>Seven, Children's Nurturing</p>
<p>Regarding the policy of nurturing children, the Japanese school authorities believe that attention should be paid to the individual physical constitution of children, so that children are consciously aware of the value of health care, and can further seek help in growth and development, and improve the path to health, in order to cultivate strong bodies and minds. Japanese schools are very concerned about the physical and mental health and hygiene of children, and believe that the improvement of children's physical and mental health is a major goal of their school. The work they carry out in nurturing is now described in two aspects, positive and negative.</p>
<p>On the positive side, there are school-wide exercises every morning and after lunch, implementing national gymnastics. The normal daily gymnastics are implemented according to the revised outline of the Ministry of Education. Extracurricular sports are held once or twice a week, and children participate freely. Sports meets are held once every semester to cultivate the spirit of sports and advancement in children. School excursions are held regularly; small excursions are held once a month, and large excursions are held once every semester, with the aim of training children's bodies.</p>
<p>A health week is held once every autumn; various health activities are actively implemented with the sports association as the center. In summer, the school grounds are also open, and children can still come to school to exercise. Students who are willing to participate in swimming can practice swimming in the summer after a physical examination. There are also martial arts clubs at ordinary times, held once every semester, to cultivate children's wrestling and judo skills. A martial arts tournament is held at the end of each semester to train children's physique and develop children's fortitude, decisiveness, endurance, courage, and progressive virtues. In severe cold or hot weather, there is often a week of kendo practice to cultivate children's perseverance.</p>
<p>On the negative side, each school holds a regular physical examination once every spring, and the results of the examination are recorded in detail on the physical examination form. Regarding oral hygiene, such as: tooth decay, tonsils, etc., there is a separate examination form to notify the children's parents, and introduce appropriate and responsible doctors, so that parents can take their children to seek treatment. In May and January of each year, when necessary, the school may hold temporary physical examinations. After examining the body, appropriate arrangements are made for changing the children's seats and changing the seats.</p>
<p>Usually, a cleaning inspection is held once a week, and attention is paid to the cleanliness of the students' desks, chairs, and clothing in each grade. The cleaning work of each classroom every day is the responsibility of the on-duty students; a major cleaning is held once at the beginning and end of each semester. Every year before the rainy season, before the summer vacation, and during the epidemic of infectious diseases, school doctors and specialized doctors are specially invited to the school to give lectures to students on hygiene matters. The third week of each month is designated as hygiene week, paying special attention to whether students have taken a bath; the cleanliness of their hair, neck, and fingernails, and whether they have developed the habit of not spitting everywhere.</p>

Compared to the previous close, both English and American currencies softened slightly. After opening, banks squeezed too much, but mostly did it against each other, so although the potential was loose, the process was fixed. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing revealed that the English and American currencies were also flat. Later, because the silver balance tax revealed a decrease of half a cent, banks still sold, and the trend gradually became difficult to recover. The same was true at noon. Although the Japanese Bank bought Eastern currency in the afternoon market, there was no change. After entering the market, banks continued to squeeze, but foreign firms were willing to settle. The prices of silver ingots did not change twice. Finally, the general trend revolved.

<p>Yesterday, the bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was shocked by the changes in the political situation. The situation in Hankou caused a surge of spot goods onto the market. Although there were no major storms in the market, the overall trend was downward throughout the day, a rare level of activity in recent weeks. Large investors were selling near-term bonds, indicating they possessed spot goods, suggesting a continued small decline is likely. Yesterday's trading saw heavy selling of the 10th and 54th issues during the morning opening, while the 4th and 38th issues saw some buying, rebounding slightly by 1.5 to 3.5 cents. In the second session, retail investors, recognizing the difficulty of the market to fall repeatedly, immediately engaged in short covering, stabilizing the market slightly. Type E remained unchanged, Type C was slightly better by 5 cents, while other issues such as the 11th and 14th continued to be sold off, falling by 5 cents to 1 or 2 cents. The afternoon opening saw selling of the 5th, 10th, and 35th issues, mostly of the current month, widely understood as spot goods flowing out. The downward trend was irreversible, and the closing price fell again by 5 cents to 1 or 2.5 cents, showing a weakened state and a possible continued decline. With only two days left in the month, selling pressure increased, and a short squeeze may be unavoidable. The final market prices saw Type B fall the most, by 80 cents, and Type E fall the least, by 40 cents. 96 also fell by 2-3 cents. The total trading volume was 8,595,000 yuan. A comparative list of the gains and losses is shown on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning but rose in the afternoon, with a trend towards strengthening, due to active yarn sales and enthusiastic purchases from various merchants. At the same time, customers were particularly active in withdrawing yarn from the exchange's warehouses, boosting confidence and pushing the price back above 200 yuan this month.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Weak in the Morning, Up in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened weak in the morning due to continued declines in American cotton. With the current month's yarn delivery approaching, sentiment was loose, and near-term contracts fell 6-7 cents. In the second session, the current month's momentum was quite weak, almost breaking the 9 yuan mark. Subsequently, spot yarn merchants, noting that the price was about 2 yuan lower than spot yarn, withdrew 1,000 bales of warehouse receipts for White Flying Fish, Globe, Heavenly Official, and Awake Lion yarns, raising prices. Far-term contracts were pulled upward, but large firms like Changfeng, Dachang, and Tongji came to sell, creating heavy pressure. However, the general industry collectively absorbed the supply, with Mao Xing, Hexing, Yuda, Dafeng, Shenji, and Renfeng buying to cover short positions. The closing prices for all months of marked yarn were down 1 to 4 cents compared to the previous day. Sales included 1,450 bales from Tongji, 1,400 bales from Mingde, 4,600 bales from Changfeng, 1,300 bales from Runkang, 1,550 bales from Dachang, 1,600 bales from Dafu, 1,700 bales from Yuda, and 1,300 bales from Yichang.

<p>The cotton market initially declined due to the weakness of foreign cotton and the dumping of 10,000 dan by a certain merchant from the Gold Trade Association, compounded by good weather. In the afternoon, improved yarn sales drove manufacturers to eagerly purchase raw materials. Prices in the production areas were higher than in Shanghai, fueling enthusiastic buying.</p>
<p>Changhe Alone Dumps 20,000 Dan</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened weak due to continued declines in American cotton, down 7 to 14 points, and Indian cotton, down 2.75 roubles. Osaka's Three Products cotton fell 3-4 cents. Market sentiment was mediocre, and the dumping of 15,000 dan by a certain merchant from the Gold Trade Association put pressure on the opening prices, pushing them down by 2-3 cents. However, industry players, recognizing the high prices in the production areas, absorbed the supply. By the close, prices had rebounded. Dafu, Dafeng, Changhe, and Fukang sold in bulk, while Ruid, Senkang, Dachangcheng, Yihe, Yongda, Xincheng, and Tonghe purchased in unison. The closing prices for all months were down 1 to 2.5 cents compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e185">New Cotton Enters the Market, Yarn and Cotton Instead Feel Firm and Expensive: A Look at the Situation Over the Past Two Weeks <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The yarn and cotton situation over the past two weeks has been characterized by intense competition between the bulls and bears. Many of the former bulls, recognizing that domestic cotton production is abundant, estimated at 16 million dan, more than double last year, have liquidated their long positions and turned bearish. Tongji, Dafu, and Yuda, who previously absorbed the most volume, have now become short sellers, with the largest short positions. The industry believes that this year's harvest will be plentiful, farmers' finances will improve, and yarn sales will be optimistic. With the pacification of the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, customer purchases have been very active recently, and factories have mostly sold out of spot yarn. Yarn inventories in yarn and cloth warehouses have gradually decreased from 37,000 bales to 26,000 bales. With the flourishing trade in fabrics, the yarn market is becoming increasingly solid. The yarn and cotton market is therefore hovering. In fact, with the entry of new cotton into the market, raw materials are expected to be cheaper, cotton yarn costs are lower, and profits are possible. Furthermore, many of the yarn factories that had suspended operations have resumed work with the availability of new cotton, gradually increasing production. In addition, foreign merchants are fiercely competing for sales in the market, and with the passing of the autumn sales season, it may be difficult to sell at good prices, so there are quite a few people selling forward contracts. Cotton factories report that their inventories of Chen cotton are thin, so they are eagerly competing for new cotton, with a strong need. However, they have no intention of trying long-term cotton. However, market prices in various production areas are higher than in Shanghai, so shipments to Shanghai are still scarce. Currently, the weather is favorable, and off-market selling is strong. Yarn sales are still good, and prices are rising daily, so factories continue to purchase raw cotton. The recent yarn and cotton market prices for the past two weeks are listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened weak, with prices ranging from up 1 point to down 4 points. Trading activity was light in the morning because the delivery notice for Friday would be released soon. Long positions in October were closed and moved to further months. At the same time, cotton farmers were selling forward contracts, and brokers were closing long positions. Cooperative brokers were selling in large quantities, causing prices to fall.

<p>Yesterday, spot cotton cloth sales saw slight weakness in East Asian fine cloth in the morning, but the market for native white cloth and Chinese and foreign patterned cloth remained stable. In the afternoon, marked yarn and cotton rose strongly, strengthening the market further. Due to extremely low inventory levels, various merchants were dispatching goods from factories daily, immediately reporting and packaging the goods received. New orders continued to come in, and market sentiment was strong. Factories' confidence was greatly boosted, and they were focused on delivering existing orders for straight tribute, broadcloth, line wool, printed flannel, velvet, and other goods. Only white cloth had some futures orders. The Changzhou Xinhua Factory released 200 bales of Blue Sky women's fine twill for this month and next month, priced at 6.45 yuan, which were absorbed by Guangdong merchants.</p>

The first session saw unusually strong buying, with prices for various months rising by 3 to 7 cents. However, with delivery approaching for the current month, the market briefly rose, and floating longs exited, taking the opportunity to liquidate. Those returning to sell short followed suit, so the afternoon situation gradually calmed down.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various merchants totaled about 25 or 26, with a total of more than 5,000 stones. However, spot sales remain sluggish, and Zhihou's early break of the market makes it difficult to revive. Except for those with high prices, the rest of the market goods are depreciated by jiao zu. Although Bao Wei continued to have Qingdao and Dalian merchants take 500 or 600 bales from the thin breaking market, the result was still a flood of new goods, and the market's confidence was weak, falling by 2 jiao. Baige has already been put on the market, and the quality is quite good. Customer merchants tried to handle 10 bales, but the uptake was particularly small. 50 bales of new japonica were also handled, but due to the flood of goods and thick sales, the price plummeted by 3 or 4 jiao, and the Dongxin factory was unable to sell it. The new Lu Jian was also mirrored and cut by 2 or 3 chi. The new Yang Jian relied on the arrival of rare goods to bring a little softness. Bian Yuan lacked goods and there was no market. The new Yin Yuan was put on the market for the first time, and the situation was quite beautiful, but it was only a temporary scenery.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 34 or 35 boats came from various merchants in He Xia. The market goods were broken japonica rice, indica rice, Bian Yuan, old Yang Jian, and new Ke Jian, and the transaction was flat. Xin Jing Dongxin Jing, Xin Yang Bu Jian, and short prices moved slightly. The market price of broken japonica rice and other goods was a few cents less, and the medium price was nearly a corner less. Xin Yang Jian and Bu Jian prices were reduced by one or two jiao, and Xin Jing was about a corner less. Thin indica rice and new Ke Jian were flat. Bian Yuan stood upright. Jia Shan Baige saw about ten stones of new rice, priced at ten yuan, and Dongxin Jing was one jiao less.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Customer Xian decreased slightly, but the existing inventory was sufficient, and the goods in transit were continuously arriving at the port, and the market often presented a situation of oversupply. If this customer does not continue to sell smoothly, the market will be difficult to maintain for a long time. Although the Customer Xian yesterday saw a lively transaction, merchants from Guangdong, Quanzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, the mainland, North China, and this street all inquired, but the number of sales was not strong, and the market was still trending down. Guangdong merchants only sold three dry bags of brown rice, but North China's appetite was fragrant, counting more than 1,000 bags of machine jing machine early, and the others were only embellished with one or two hundred bags to three or five hundred bags. A total of 1,253 bags of Hunan rice, 171 bags of Beijing Xian, 2,500 bags of Shashi brown rice, and 2,065 bags of Jiangxi rice were opened for sale throughout the day, and the price was a small number of cents to Jiao Xu less than the previous day.</p>

It was also heard that other teas were currently sending telegrams to foreign buyers to discuss market prices.</p>
<p>According to another report, the tea market yesterday remained deserted. European firms have not received any replies to the telegrams sent last week regarding green teas from various regions, because the Jewish tea merchants with the highest authority there are still on holiday for the New Year. (It is said that the Jews celebrate the New Year in September.) As a result, there was not much silk and tea trading, only Gongxi had a few transactions. Persian firms had some sales, and the market price did not fluctuate much. As for Qimen black tea, it is heard that the Anhui Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee quite agreed with the overall sales strategy proposed by the Shanghai General Transportation and Sales Office, and will wait to discuss it with customers.</p>

For the remaining places such as Lanxi, Tunxi, and Ningguo, the products are better, and customer sales are not declining, so the price can still maintain its original position. The current market price for high-grade slices is 180 yuan, unified Zhuang is 140-150 yuan, and the next grade is 130-140 yuan. Furthermore, the merchants still hope to raise prices, and the current market is releasing goods because of economic problems.</p>

<p>— (Ba Ling)</p>
<p>It is said that in Shanghai, due to various reasons, several people commit suicide by drowning in the Huangpu River or by other means every day. If this is true, then the issue of suicide is indeed a serious social problem that we absolutely cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Speaking of the reasons for suicide, if analyzed, they are roughly nothing more than the two major elements of "love" and "life." Indeed, food and sex are the two major needs of life. Some people commit suicide because they cannot solve their livelihood problems, while others commit suicide because of changes in their love lives. On the surface, these two reasons seem to make the former more serious. However, in my opinion, no matter what, suicide is never the right way. A history of life, thoroughly speaking, is a history of struggle. We must struggle every day we live. Those who have solved the problems of food and sex should, of course, struggle. But those who have not solved their livelihood problems should especially strive. Only those who struggle have a place to live in society. You must know that bread will not fall from the sky. Once you understand this, then you will see how unreasonable suicide is.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi said: "Life comes for a great cause and should leave after completing a great cause." This is very true. Everyone has a mission in life. Since we are humans with round heads and square toes, then we must do something beneficial to ourselves and society. It is really wrong to take suicide as a "one and done" action after encountering some setbacks.</p>
<p>Friends: We should firmly remember the famous saying: "Life is for great causes, and we should leave after accomplishing some achievements."</p>
<h3 id="e212">Talking About Horses <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Speaking of horses, they have always been valued by people throughout history. "Trading a beloved concubine for a horse" is sung in the Music Bureau poems and is a popular story. This is one. Also, throughout history, which famous general has not had a beloved horse to depend on for life, sharing happiness and hardship together? This is two. Therefore, the selection of horse breeds has always been a matter of concern for people, which is of course. According to our country, horse breeds have always been inferior to others. In the past, countries such as Dayuan produced famous horses, as seen in various notes. Recently, the world's best horse breeds are undoubtedly those from Arabia, with those from Mongolia still trailing behind. The advantages of Arabian horses are their strong feet and tall height. Strong feet mean they can race with cars; tall height means they can leap over a person's head. Moreover, they are intelligent and sensitive. Once trained, they obey their masters' orders. They are so rare and valuable that the Arabs treat their horses as their second lives, with the idea of "not valuing children but valuing horses." Each horse is worth between five or six thousand gold to ten thousand gold. Male horses are especially valuable because they can crossbreed and spread the breed.</p>
<p>The price for a foreign horse to mate with an Arabian male horse is also considerable. It is said that the Arabian horse owner can get as much as five or six hundred gold for each time. However, a famous breed cannot be obtained from just one mating. It must go through six or seven times before it can be no different from a pure Arabian horse. For example, if there is a mare from the Hao Ancient breed, after mating with an Arabian male horse, the offspring happens to be a filly. When it grows up, another Arabian male horse is selected to mate with it, and the offspring is again a filly. Only after going through this six or seven times can that horse—whether male or female—have the same qualities and physique as a true Arabian horse.</p>
<p>It is said that our country's certain institutions only have a dozen or so pure Arabian horses, which are used exclusively for mating. The feeding cost of each horse per day is more than two gold, which is enough for the daily expenses of an eight-member family. It really makes people's tongues wag and sigh, "Humans are not as good as horses!"</p>

<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>The residents around Penglai Road, when mentioning the chubby, buoyant-looking Big Guy, almost everyone knows him. Especially the students of Meixi, Xicheng, Aiqun, and Shangwen elementary schools nearby are even more familiar with him. Therefore, in this vicinity, the name of Big Guy can truly be said to be famous far and wide, known to all women.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is sunny, raining, windy, or snowing, Big Guy always sets up his stall all year round, diligently doing his very low-income job, without a hint of weariness or a trace of complaint, always smiling.</p>
<p>His stall is fully stocked with candies, toys, and bread snacks. In winter, there are baked squid and boiled rice cakes. In summer, there are even more ice cream and sour plum soup. Therefore, although it is a small stall, it can be said to have everything.</p>
<p>Elementary school students are his only major customers. Dismissal time is also the main time for his business. During this time, he is very busy dealing with these small customers.</p>
<p>Big Guy, although engaged in this petty occupation, has been working hard all year round. Now he has accumulated some money and has entered another stage, opening a shop and becoming a boss. The reason he has reached this point today is entirely due to his perseverance and hard-working spirit!</p>
<h3 id="e214">Hometown Red Swastika Society <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Sisu</p>
<p>Fortunately, in our hometown—Taixian County—a branch of the World Red Swastika Society has been organized. Helpless poor people will not be displaced, and there is a relief organization in the event of natural disasters.</p>
<p>Managing local charitable undertakings depends entirely on getting the right people. So-called getting the right people, business ability is secondary. First, the person in charge must have a truly compassionate and self-sacrificing spirit, with only the locality in their eyes, not themselves, in order to not betray the original intention of charity. The president of the Taixian Red Swastika Society branch is Mr. De Liang, the esteemed father of Cao Mengyu. He is also the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and has been re-elected for ten years, unable to refuse. The reason is that, in addition to presiding over the Red Swastika Society to carry out charitable undertakings, he is also relied upon to uphold justice and resolve disputes, and all the merchants and people do not allow him to get away with it. Mr. De Liang has repeatedly wanted to get rid of the Chamber of Commerce and devote himself to charitable undertakings, but it is impossible.</p>
<p>The Taixian Red Swastika Society branch, due to the small size of the meeting place, has decided to build a large building with more than 20 rooms, which requires about 15,000 yuan. More than 10,000 yuan have already been donated by various parties, but because disaster relief has been advanced and released, it is not enough. Until now, members have found an opportunity to complete it. It turns out that this autumn is Mr. De Liang's sixtieth birthday, and it has been publicly agreed to celebrate his birthday and use the banquet funds to pay for construction costs. However, whether Mr. De Liang agrees is still unknown. Although we are traveling abroad now, for the sake of our hometown society, we very much hope that it can be realized!</p>

<p>Youmei laughed again, shook her head twice, and said: Because you are still very traditional, I can't just say anything. Menglan had a very righteous face and nodded to him twice, saying: What you said to me is all from the heart, and I am very grateful. However, I have my own private opinion. First, no matter what I do, I want to take care of my personality. Second, although I myself cannot make meaningless sacrifices, I also do not want to sacrifice others to fulfill my private plans. Hearing him say this, Youmei supported the table with her left hand, supported her cheek, and touched a pencil on the table with her right hand, knocking it on the table with the back of the pencil. She stared at a copy of Jiangnan Magazine spread out on the table, lost in thought. Menglan, because her eyes were focused, did not understand what it meant, so he said: This is the latest publication, do you have it? Youmei said: I am not like you who is obsessed with magazines. I buy one to read when I have time. If I miss the issue and don't buy it, then so be it. But why are you so enthusiastic? Menglan said: It's not that I'm particularly enthusiastic about magazines, it's just that I'm sitting at home all day, very bored, and I only borrow these few magazines to relieve the boredom in my chest. Youmei said: Do you like to read the novels in this magazine? Or do you like old essays? Menglan said: Of course, I like to read novels. Youmei said: Which writer in the magazine do you admire the most now? Menglan said: I read magazines just to browse, and after reading them, I throw them aside. I don't care who is good and who is bad. Youmei laughed: Relatively speaking, who has a deeper impression on you? Menglan said, why do you keep asking about this, I find it a bit strange. After he finished saying this, his face was not so natural, which was a mistake on his part, but Youmei was a little suspicious. (Seven Eight)</p>
<h3 id="e216">Formidable Enemy of the Pawnshop Industry <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoxia</p>
<p>I met a friend, Mr. Mou, who is in the pawnshop industry. He lamented that the pawnshop industry has been declining in recent years, and that the golden age of the pawnshop industry has passed. Because more items are pawned than redeemed, and the outlet for pawned goods is also sluggish. I asked about the situation of redeeming pawns for customers in the past two years and the impact on the pawnshop industry. According to him, the method of redeeming pawns for customers was first planned and implemented by Lu Shui, the owner of Lu Tianbao in Dapuqiao. Although it was only advertised in small advertisements in newspapers, there were many people in the society who held pawn tickets. Therefore, in recent years, gold, diamonds, jewelry, and jade that have not been redeemed when the term expired have been as rare as phoenix feathers. Pawnshops hope that the owner will redeem the items pawned in order to earn interest. However, gold, diamonds, jewelry, and jade are expected to be pawned out when the term expires because of the low cost and high profit. Now, this benefit has been taken away by the gold store and returned to the owner of the item, which is like a formidable enemy of the pawnshop industry.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Two Famous Products of Guangdong <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was invited by Mr. Zhao Zemin to drink at his new residence. The dishes were very rich. One dish was olive-braised dace, which tasted very delicious. I had never tasted this dish in my life, so I asked the host. According to him: Olives are very cheap to make in Guangdong because they are produced there, and this thing is widely used. The olive kernels required for Crown Garden mooncakes are purchased in bulk from there. Because olive production is quite rich and the demand is quite large, the dish used today is locally called "oil-extracted olive corner". My friends from Guangdong brought it here. Hongkou in Shanghai also sells it. When it is first made, the green olives are cut in half at the waist, and the kernels in the pits are used to make mooncakes. It is said that each load is about 80 taels of gold this year. In previous years, when the harvest was small, it was as expensive as 130 to 140. The so-called "oil-extracted olive corner" is made by first paying salt-preserved and dried the olive meat, reading the date, and drying it extremely. Then, it is soaked in "oil-extracted oil" (that is, the top-quality soy sauce here, also known as white oil). Soak it for two days, and then dry it again. Do this twice and it is done. Not only will it not change for a long time, but it is also very delicious to use it to cook dishes. When used with porridge, you only need to add soy sauce, sugar, and a little raw oil to mix it. The fragrance is refreshing, and olives are cool in nature, so eating them for a long time is good for the body. I am happy to record it.</p>
<p>Also, He Chumei, the head of the wholesale department of Crown Garden, has lived in the south for generations. His ancestors were doctors, especially proficient in ophthalmology, so there is the "Bird Gold Eye Medicine" that has been sold at home and abroad for 150 years. The other day, my wife had an eye disease, and she was given several bottles of this product. After applying it for a week, the redness in her eyes completely subsided. Mr. He said: "It is still popular far from Nanyang, Europe, and the United States, and close to China and South China. Old and young people in Guangdong especially know that He Tongren's 'Bird Gold Eye Medicine' is a famous and valuable medicine." Now the four major companies in Shanghai also sell it on consignment, and it is also selling well in Beijing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi. According to Mr. He: Eye diseases are the most difficult to treat, because the eyes belong to the kidneys. If the kidney water is insufficient, the eyes will be confused. This bird gold can still be cured when it is about to go blind, and it is especially effective for red eyes and insufficient eyesight after a sleepless night, as well as for the weakening eyesight of the elderly. It can be completely cured and can also be applied to external symptoms to achieve results.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Japan's Scheduled World Games <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>Ever since the next World Games were decided to be held in Tokyo, Japan, the Japanese have been very excited. Because it coincides with the 2,600th anniversary of Japan's founding, the opportunity is very rare. On the one hand, the Japanese know that after the World Games are held in Tokyo, the income will be considerable, so they believe that the World Games are the only opportunity to make a fortune. They calculated that the Lausanne Games had an income of 150 million yen, and this time Berlin can get 100 million yen. Although Tokyo is farther from Europe and the United States, the enthusiasm of foreigners for sightseeing in Japan and the low price of Japanese silver dollars are enough to attract visitors. In this Berlin Games, there were about 300,000 foreign spectators. In Japan, because of the Commemorative Exposition, there will be at least 100,000 people, which will cost about 100 million yen in Tokyo. In addition, there were only 3,000 athletes in Lausanne. This time, 53 countries participated, reaching 6,000 people. In Tokyo, with 3,000 people calculated, the average cost per person is 2,000 yen, then 6 million yen is needed. The Japanese are also flocking to see the Games, so there will be no less than one million visitors from various places. The average cost per person is 50 yen, totaling 50 million yen. Therefore, according to their budget, the World Games can send a huge amount of 256 million yen into the hands of Tokyo people.</p>
<p>Newspapers and magazines also often introduce the opportunities to make a fortune during the World Games. The Japanese are experts in small-scale business. At that time, restaurants, cigarette shops, hotels, amusement parks, toy stores, etc. will definitely make their speculative business a big deal.</p>
<p>Due to years of expanding its military, Japan's construction projects in recent years have not been as good as in the years after the Great Earthquake. The provinces, seeing the military's expenses expand without limit, all want to take the opportunity to expand once. Four years later, the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the country and the World Games will bring double happiness. Various construction projects can be renovated, and the military will have to dare to be angry but dare not speak out. The current budget is 10.4 million yen for the venue, 6.8 million yen for the renovation of Tokyo Station, 10 million yen for road construction, 1 million yen for the Olympic Village, 10 million yen for the City Hall, and other projects such as the National Museum, the Exposition venue, and the Founding Memorial Hall. Various projects cost at least about 60 million yen.</p>
<p>Anything can become a business in Japan. Holding the World Games in Japan is a big business for all Tokyo people, so it is called the "God of Fortune." It is estimated that for the World Games, Tokyo's construction and expenses will reach 300 million yen. The 6 million citizens of Tokyo will get an average of 50 yen per person. The profit-seeking Japanese, hearing that such a huge amount of money will come to Tokyo, are of course overjoyed.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Chicken Feather Shops in Beiping <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Sheli</p>
<p>In the northern country, the cold is as sharp as a knife.</p>
<p>Well-off people put on heavy fur coats. The whole family, big and small, surround the stove and drink two cups, creating a "Nine Nine Cold Dissipation Picture". How comfortable! What if you're bored in the house? Take a chartered car to the cinema. There are radiators there.</p>
<p>As for the poor men and women who have become beggars, they don't have the blessing to surround the stove to dissipate the cold. The cinema won't allow them in. During the day, they huddle up in the cold wind, begging lords, ladies, young masters, and young misses for a penny. At night, they rush to the chicken feather shop.</p>
<p>Chicken feather shops are a specialty of Beiping and a blessing for beggars!</p>
<p>They are mostly located outside Tianqiao Hademen. You can't find their traces in the bustling urban areas. The rent is too expensive there! Beggars come here to sleep for a night. In the past, it was only three big [coins] (a big coin is two small copper coins), but now? It's up! One big coin! (That is, one copper coin worth paying Ganwen), if it doesn't rise, it will lose its capital.</p>
<p>Here, there are no eyes like Naoma Xila, no steam from radiators, and no rich wine fragrance. It's just a simple house filled with chicken feathers and chicken shit stench. There are no berths. People come and lie on the ground at will, covering their heads and bodies with chicken feathers. The unbearable cold!</p>
<p>Singers, fortune tellers, lotus drummers, people with broken legs, people with missing hands, blind people without eyes, patients with dropsy... They have all become brothers sleeping together.</p>
<p>When it gets cold, the chicken feather shop opens its doors, and every night, the customers are always squeezed in.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Center of European Political Activity Moves to Geneva <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th - The center of European political activity will move to Geneva tomorrow, as the League of Nations General Assembly will open in a highly threatening environment to hold important meetings. I think this kind of meeting will not have much effect, because the driving force behind Europe's precarious state lies entirely in Germany and Italy. Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, and Italy has also withdrawn in an invisible way. This kind of political activity is only a one-sided activity of those who advocate democracy.</p>
<p>So, in terms of the overall picture of Europe? Europe is now divided into two major factions, one is the democratic faction, and the other is the fascist faction. If neither of these two opposing flags can be withdrawn or overthrown, then there will be no peace in Europe. To put it bluntly, the first faction advocates preserving colonies, and the second faction advocates redistributing colonies. In short, it is just a colonial problem. Under the current circumstances, neither side is willing to give in easily. The result can only be resolved with airplanes and artillery fire. The paper tiger of Geneva has long been exposed. Even if it is repaired, it must be repaired in a way that one bag is replaced with another, and one bag is worse than the other.</p>
<p>I take a step back and talk about the inside story of the League of Nations. What the League of Nations should urgently solve now is the Spanish Civil War, the war between Nuremberg and Moscow, the global frenzy of rearmament, and the tense situation in Palestine. All of these will be ominous backgrounds in the discussion of this decision by the General Assembly. However, if none of these serious issues are raised for direct discussion, then the reopening of this decision by the League of Nations General Assembly can be said to be a waste of money, time, and effort. The result will definitely be the same as when our country's athletes attended the World Games, eating a few dumplings and dispersing. I think this is a futile effort.</p>
<p>Secondly, the issue of the representative of Abyssinia attending The Credentials Committee appointed by the General Assembly to review the credentials of representatives of various countries. Among them, the credentials of the representative of Abyssinia are the most difficult. Geneva reported again on the 21st that Abyssinia requested to attend the League of Nations General Assembly. Several major member states of the League of Nations have preconceived notions. The Credentials Committee should refuse Abyssinia's request under the pretext, so that all representatives are unwilling to serve as members of the Credentials Committee. From this issue alone, it can be seen that the League of Nations itself has lost its qualification to exist. When Italy invaded Abyssinia, the League of Nations resolved that Italy was an aggressor country. When Italy captured the Abyssinian capital and the Italian king concurrently held the title of Emperor of Abyssinia, the League of Nations did not recognize it. Then Abyssinia's qualification as a member state of the League of Nations clearly still exists and has not been revoked. Then how can the League of Nations refuse to accept Abyssinia as a member state of the League of Nations when it decides to hold a meeting? Now that the League of Nations is meeting, and the representative of Abyssinia is being refused attendance, I really don't know what the reason is?</p>
<p>However, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the famous reporter Gaige, recently published an article in the Italian Daily, which roughly said that as long as the Abyssinian delegation is in Geneva, Italy will not participate in the work of the League of Nations. Although Italy does not seek recognition of its sovereignty over Abyssinia, Italy cannot recognize a group of exiles who come out to represent this regime. From these two things alone, does the League of Nations still have value in holding meetings? Can the League of Nations still achieve practical results in holding meetings? Therefore, I think it's better not to hold them.</p>
<h3 id="e221">A Visit to the Mudu Chastity Preservation Bureau (Part 2) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Feature from This Newspaper) Their ages are all advanced, the oldest being around sixty or seventy, and the youngest over forty. I walked out from the door on the right side of the Buddhist hall and saw a virtuous widow in her twenties cooking. Beside her were two elderly women, one folding tin foil, and the other doing laundry. So I greeted the woman doing laundry, hoping to inquire about the bureau's clerk. She turned out to be a woman from a respectable family and very talkative. She generously pulled up a bamboo chair for me to sit on, and then introduced me to the young woman cooking and the old woman folding tin foil. It turned out they were mother and daughter-in-law. Because the daughter-in-law's husband had died and she wished to remain chaste here, her mother-in-law had also come to live with her.</p>
<p>First, she told me that Mr. Lin from here had gone to Guangfu on business. Then, she told me about the general situation of the bureau, as she had been here for over thirty years and knew a lot. She spoke of the bureau's decline and current financial difficulties, expressing a sense of deep emotion for the past.</p>
<p>While telling me, she also invited me to see their rooms, saying that the rooms here were originally very large, but many places were collapsing.</p>
<p>As we were looking at those empty, collapsing houses, Mr. Lin returned from Guangfu. So, after he invited me to the reception room, he told me about the bureau's past and present situation. The bureau originally had no fixed basic funding, only donations from various parties. There used to be some, but now they have completely stopped. Even the ten donation tickets from this county can only collect three hundred cash per ticket each month. All the bureau's regular expenses, in addition to the rent rice collected from the five hundred mu of bureau-owned land, and some coffin storage fees from the Lingyan Funeral Home at the foot of Mount Shengyan, there is nothing else produced.</p>
<p>In recent years, land rent has been very difficult to collect. Even rents from three or four years ago have not yet been collected, so the bureau's finances have become difficult. Because of this, the bureau had to tighten its expenses, reducing one of the original four clerks. The Lingyan Elementary School attached to the bureau has also been closed, and the widows' children have all gone to the county elementary school to study. All the costs of books and other expenses are borne by the widows themselves, and the widows' daily vegetables have also been reduced to a pitiful amount!</p>
<p>There are currently more than thirty widows in the bureau, with a total of more than forty people, all from this county. It is said that in the past, when there were the most, there were seventy or eighty people here. Widows who wish to enter the bureau must have a guarantor recommend them and fill out an investigation form. After the bureau investigates and confirms that their family background is truly clean and that they are helpless widows, they can enter the bureau. Those with young children or elderly aunts are also allowed to bring them, but they must pay an entrance fee of more than two yuan when entering the bureau for the purpose of tidying the house. After entering the bureau, the bureau provides a room. Apart from food, the bureau does not bear any other expenses. In the past, the bureau was responsible for the widows' old age, death, and illness, but now it has been completely abolished. The money the widows earn from their own work is theirs to keep. After death, their relatives must come to collect the body for burial, or a collection will be taken up locally. Those whose own children have grown up and wish to start a family and leave the bureau are allowed to do so, but they must also pay an exit fee of more than two yuan to pay for tidying up the house.</p>
<p>Normally, widows cannot go out casually except to go shopping. If they need to visit relatives or travel far and must stay overnight, they must apply to the clerk and obtain permission before being allowed, but there are restrictions, only once a month, and they cannot exceed the prescribed date. Any widow who violates the rules will be ordered to leave the bureau.</p>
<p>It is said that the rules of the Chastity Preservation Bureau were originally very strict, but now they are not as strict as they used to be, and recently there have been almost no lonely widows requesting to enter the bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Closing Down <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ni</p>
<p>Morning.</p>
<p>The accountant strode in and slammed the fake mahogany dresser so hard it echoed: "Rent! Rent! You said you'd pay today, how many months are you paying?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li, who was wiping the uneven mirror on the wardrobe with a tattered cloth, jumped up as if an orange had burned his butt, pleadingly: "Accountant, to tell you the truth, this woodworking trade of ours is much harder than before. Young people nowadays, they all want mo... modern things, they don't like my fake mahogany..."</p>
<p>"Stop rambling, how about the rent?" The accountant's air was like a father scolding his son.</p>
<p>"Sir, there's really no way, no way, please forgive me..."</p>
<p>"What nonsense, four months' rent... forgive... bullshit!"</p>
<p>"...no way... for... forgive." Mr. Li was sweating profusely, holding a rag, unable to think of any pleading words. A bead of sweat fell into his eye, causing a sharp pain, so he picked up the rag to wipe his eyes, leaving several black lines on his eyelid.</p>
<p>The two gatekeepers standing behind the accountant, holding rent tickets, almost burst out laughing at the scene. But the accountant didn't even have a hint of a smile, his face ashen: "Bullshit! Bullshit! I give you until lunchtime to send three months' rent to the accounting office, or I'll come and seal the door tomorrow!" - Saying that, he put the pencil on his ear and left.</p>
<p>Three months' rent, three times three is nine, three times six is eighteen, one hundred and eight yuan. Upstairs in the chest, there are forty-three yuan that A-Ju kept for her dowry, and... and the eight yuan of wages for A-Xiang the cook in my waistband for last month, a total of fifty-one yuan. How is that enough? Thinking of this, Mr. Li's heart felt like hemp.</p>
<p>Although he thought of the wooden furniture in the shop... But...</p>
<p>Next door, Yu Chang Pawnshop "stopped accepting wooden furniture."</p>
<p>Mr. Li didn't eat lunch, sitting on the stool in a daze like a lost soul. His mind was thinking of many things... someone losing a wallet at the door... an aviation lottery ticket...</p>
<p>"Why didn't you take it when I told you to take it at lunchtime?"</p>
<p>Thinking it was the accountant, Mr. Li jumped up again as if the stool had burned his butt. He looked closely, it wasn't the accountant, it was the gatekeeper A-Wang.</p>
<p>"Brother A-Wang, you know the suffering of poor people, please say a word for me to the accountant, and ask him to give me a few days' grace."</p>
<p>"How can that be? To be honest, even the accountant can't make the decision, the foreigners above are urging us very hard. You still have to think of a way..."</p>
<p>"What way is there to think of? I've borrowed from everyone I can borrow from."</p>
<p>A-Wang's attitude was as amiable as Jie Tou asking Mr. Li for wine money: "We're all barefoot people... it's not like there's no way..." Whispering in his ear, mumbling a few words: "Your wooden furniture is worth more than this, and if you sue, sealing the door and stuff, it won't look good on their faces..."</p>
<p>Mr. Li took thirty-three yuan from the forty-three yuan dowry money in the chest and gave it to A-Wang. A-Wang, A-Ju, and her mother stood aside, shedding tears. Mr. Li wanted to ask A-Wang for the rent ticket. A-Wang said: "The rent ticket has been taken to the new government office, if you want it, you have to take a trip there."</p>
<p>After A-Wang left, Mr. Li instructed the staff to tidy up their things.</p>
<p>The next morning, Mr. Li had already settled all his things—the fake mahogany furniture—in his maternal uncle's courtyard. He sighed there from time to time.</p>
<p>He didn't eat lunch. He told A-Ju's mother that he was going outside to look for a shop location and went out.</p>
<p>He searched for most of the day, but couldn't agree on a single place. Rent was too expensive in busy areas, and cheaper places weren't good.</p>
<p>On the way home, he passed by the front of his shop. Many people were there, pointing and gesturing, saying: "...the market is depressed... this furniture shop, it was doing well yesterday, but now it's moved away, there's nothing left..."</p>
<p>The words Mr. Li heard filled him with sadness, almost bringing him to tears. He saw that the shop door was open, and the accountant was talking to someone. He squeezed in to hear what the accountant was saying?</p>
<p>"...the lowest price, four months' rent, two floors put on top of three floors, very well built, at least seven or eight yuan if you make new ones, now we're asking you for thirty yuan, ten yuan is the opening fee, if you want to take over, at least..."</p>
<p>The person standing opposite the accountant shook his head: "I only plan to offer one hundred yuan..."</p>
<p>Mr. Li ran away filled with grievances. He understood A-Wang's kindness in advising him to move out that night.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Child Brides in Southern Fujian <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tian</p>
<p>Like elsewhere, women are looked down upon in our Southern Fujian. "Obedient at home, obedient to her husband after marriage, and obedient to her son in old age," "If you marry a chicken, you follow the chicken, if you marry a dog, you follow the dog." These shackles—so-called virtues—imposed on women by feudal society still hold firm in the minds of the general public. Especially the notion that daughters can't produce wealth and will eventually marry out, even wealthy families in the city, except for the first pregnancy, mostly "marry out" their daughters within three days of birth. At that time, the parents only need to spend a little money to prepare some clothes for her, and buy some rouge, lead powder, taro, bananas, pears, oranges, lotus candles, cotton, "beautiful face" flowers, sugar balls, raw pork, pork bones, and bean cakes as customary dowry items, put them in a red basket, and together with the daughter, give the midwife a baby to any family—the in-laws—and consider their responsibility as parents complete. They treat their own daughters like doing business, thinking that even if they are raised, getting a few hundred dollars of betrothal money is not worth it.</p>
<p>Besides small citizens in the city, almost every corner of the countryside has people adopting child brides, one or two or three at a time. Even landlords and wealthy farmers do this; especially those without sons need them even more. Because they can hope that the child bride will bring in a capable man in the future to carry on the family line. People who sever their descendants are usually despised: even if they have not committed any evil deeds in this life, people will add that their "previous life" must have been a deeply sinful person. Moreover, adopting a child bride does not require much care: it only takes a little time each day to breastfeed or feed. In addition, they leave the ignorant little baby in the cradle to cry, to soak in shit and urine. They don't feel any guilt for treating the little daughter-in-law like this, because they themselves were raised like this. They also know that their own daughters are treated the same in other people's homes, but they don't care. The so-called "at home, praying for sandalwood, out of home, firewood in the fire alley," means that daughters can be as precious as sandalwood at home, but once married out, they are like firewood in the fire alley that no one wants to burn, arbitrarily abandoned. If unfortunately the child bride dies halfway, the adopter will of course attribute it to fate, and even the parents will only sigh: saying that their own daughter has a bad life, no luck. Because child brides can be arbitrarily abused, their death rate is shockingly high! According to general estimates, among those who are raised to adulthood and can marry or bring in a man, at most only three or four out of ten.</p>
<p>But raising a child bride is not just to reduce the burden when she is an adult. When the child bride reaches the age of five or six, the in-laws can not give her a penny and whip her to clean the house, pick up fallen leaves, and take care of the little husband, little brothers-in-law, or little sisters-in-law, etc. After another year or two, everything comes. Washing diapers, cooking, carrying firewood and rice, holding children, feeding livestock... everything is done: but she has no luck with food and clothing. But child brides are treated in many different ways! Even in her mother's house, if she was born in the year of the "Tiger," or if the fortune-telling blind man determined that her "fate" was clashing with something or bad, she will of course not be tolerated by her mother's family and will be thrown out earlier. Once she arrives at her husband's house, she will not only be particularly despised, but if a death occurs, she will be even worse off; she will not only be considered the one who "clashed" with them and be abused, but will often freeze to death or starve to death because she is not taken care of. But what does this poor little baby understand?</p>
<p>Speaking of their marriage, it is also very miserable. Their marriage often starts at the age of fourteen or fifteen; sometimes at these ages, they already have a child in their arms. Most of them have not gone through any marriage ceremony, and some only hold a perfunctory ceremony after giving birth. Those who are in-laws are all filled with eager thoughts of holding a grandson. Because once there is a grandson, when they die, they can write "Great-Grandfather of Three Generations" or "Great-Grandmother of Three Generations" on the white lantern. If they adopt another granddaughter-in-law to raise, they can even write "Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother of Four Generations." Even if they are too poor to buy a coffin, people will still call him or her "lucky," and they also seem to be able to die in peace. Therefore, they are not worried about the behavior of their daughter-in-law before marriage. Child brides, with very few exceptions, also think that they have already become someone's daughter-in-law, and have been designated as the wife of a certain son of their in-laws, so they have no choice but to let that unmarried man dispose of her. Even before development is complete, it is difficult to escape, because those who are future husbands are mostly five or six years or more than ten years older than themselves. If the in-laws don't have a son themselves, they are also filled with hope of bringing in a capable man as soon as possible! First, to reduce suffering, second, to have a grandson to hold, and third, to avoid making the little daughter-in-law cause trouble. In this way, little daughters-in-law often have to live a sexual life with a stranger when they are just developing. They have no freedom to choose at all, and the sadness they feel can only be endured in their hearts. If the man is not happy, then she will have to be sold around like a "tomb tree." Their lives are dark.</p>

<p>The affairs of the world are like a game of chess. The vicissitudes of fortune sigh at floating dust. Since ancient times, how many infatuated lovers. Having read the vicissitudes of life, I feel the ancient and the present. I think I am, a chivalrous heart and proud bones. Wandering the rivers and lakes for ten springtimes. I sigh at my humble life as a mayfly. I am used to speaking out injustices in the world. Jia Shu is, a romantic young master in love with Fengxi. Utter affection, utter love. Before leaving, he entrusted her with a heavy emotional burden. Tell her to always keep a bit of his heart. Who knew that Fengxi was, a flower bud envied by the wind and rain. Who will come to be a guardian bell for the flower? He only regrets, mistakenly entering the tiger's den, her beauty trapped. Spring locked heavy doors, no one seen. Letting her tears drip like cuckoos crying at the night moon. Embroidered curtains silent, weeping at dusk. Fortunately, his secret mother transmitted news. Suddenly touching the heroic ear with a start. Therefore, he risked his life to explore the tiger's den. There are walls with ears, secrets heard from over the wall. Secretly watching that, the general does not change his crazy slave-like state. Sometimes, he begs others with a humble and flattering look. And the pearl-stringed curios are dazzling. Ya Qin is entrusted to mediate. Unexpectedly, the daughter loves golden objects. She only values gold, not affection. Since ancient times, the battlefield of love has many strange states. Gold is good for buying beautiful women's hearts. If I had known, mirror flowers and water moons are empty shadows. I would not have, doubted and suspected, falsely acting as true. But I, seeing the situation, am always filled with grief. It is difficult to suppress the raging tide for a time. I can't wait to cut off this love seed for you. Don't betray the long-term trust. Alas, the young master Zhong quietly like in a dream. Tragically turning the consequences into previous causes. Therefore, a letter is sent by post.

<p>Xing Ruiting's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Lin Ji (1220) 9:05 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "The Explanation of Romanticism"</p>
<p>One point of talent, one point of affection. Who is heartless, who is affectionate. Beauties cannot help but love talented men. Talented men also love beauties. But there is one thing that is hateful. Affection is long or short, not uniform. There are also, those who are difficult to see when they are usually affectionate. There are also. Those who are unintentionally intimate. There are also, those who start by messing around and end by abandoning. There are also, those who first become Wu and Yue and then become married. It's not that people's hearts are thick or thin. It's just because talent is shallow or deep. How can this change start today? There were many who came before. Admirable is, Song Hong not abandoning his old wife. Lovely is, Lechang holding a mirror not remarrying, Detestable is, Li Yi heartlessly forgetting old favors. Disgusting is, Wang Kui intentionally betraying his previous oath. Wheat can be intimate with willows. Poems inscribed on leaves also become marriages. It's ridiculous that the world is confused and doesn't wake up. Secretly stealing jade and fragrance is considered normal. Dewy couples recognize it as true. What's the use of fighting for love and jealousy. Suddenly causing turmoil is not peaceful. It's ridiculous, not understanding the two words of romanticism. Boasting of being talented men and beauties. Isn't it the opposite of being misled by romanticism? Yangtai is not a romantic pavilion. Making romanticism a matter of truth. However, affection is not romanticism. Even if romanticism is a few points lighter. I advise all talented men of romanticism. There is no talent, no affection. Forcing romanticism to explain affection. It is a sin of romanticism. Where you can find pleasure, find pleasure.</p>

<p>Good scenery. Some are getting drunk and playing with the moon. Some are carrying the moon in a small boat. Some are strolling in the suburbs to watch the bright moon. Some are playing with the moon and reciting the wind into a drunken land. There is also that once-a-year Mid-Autumn Moon. Meeting that beautiful scenery and good time, busy playing with the moon. Seeing that the moon is white and the flowers are fragrant, it is really happy. It is even more happy to play with beauties. The most wonderful thing is to visit the Moon Palace within the Guanghan Palace. Talking with Chang'e in the moon. A song of neon clothes sings in the moon. Feather clothes dance out of the Moon Palace room. A humble cold moon steals new tunes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to climb the Mingyue Hall. Therefore, every time I enjoy the moon, I think of neon clothes.</p>

<p>The Star Film Company's great production of the year "Women's Rights" premieres tonight at 9:15 PM at the Jincheng Grand Theater. "Women's Rights" is directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Ms. Hu Die, who has been away from the screen for a long time. Zhao Dan, Yan Yuexian, Gong Jianong, Ye Qiuxin, Mei Xi, Shu Xiwen, Wang Xianzhai, Yuan Shaomei, Wang Zhengxin, and Lu Luming co-star. Hong Shen wrote the screenplay, depicting a woman who has received a university education who is unaccustomed to the powdered air of a young mistress and leaps into society, from a bank clerk, a female teacher, to a female worker, suffering all kinds of setbacks. Although she returns to her pink dreams, she finally feels the emptiness of women's status and walks away in the night wind. The description is moving, and the performance is tonight. After the screening, it will continue to be screened tomorrow. The new autumn is a good time for watching movies, and "Women's Rights" is currently the best film, and people from all walks of life should be happy to watch it.</p>
