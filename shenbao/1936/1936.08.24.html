<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本的文化使節</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>威爾斯在「人類的工作財富與幸福」一書。有一節講到現代外交使節說是各國駐外外交官吏因過去傳統的關係。大都出身於高貴的家庭。只知道禮節與詭謀。因此甚至有人說。這些在歐洲各國首都外交官吏差不多是各處中年有勢力婦人的寵兒。他們是代表國家的「浪子。」除開外交官吏之外。各國又有海陸軍武官和商務參贊的派遣。接着威爾斯以現代各國外交部尙未注意派遣文化使節考察所在國的科學工作。哲學藝術及社會進步。深致惋惜。不料這位現代大思想家對現代政治不滿的事。我們的東鄰文相。却起來首先倡導。這種創舉。將來這位英國多才多藝的歷史家。假使再寫一本類似「世界史綱。」的著作時。也許要大書特書的吧。</p>
<p>日本文部省的提出文化外交使節。常川駐剳於華盛頓倫敦柏林等處。其所負使命加何。其目的何在。又其能否成為事實。電訊傳來。語焉不詳我們不能妄加推測。然而文化使節之設。果成事實。其意義不同尋常。自可斷言。我們今年已經聽到那位日本靑年外交象現駐美大使濟藤博宜吿世界。日本有安定東亞落後區域的責任。與默美同。則日本之自視為文明國家。可與歐美較一日之長。早已無疑問。而中國及其他亞洲國家之為落後區。域經過數年來日本的「王道」宣揚。和這位外交家的詔示。似乎也早已成為定讞。那末日本如何能見重於歐美人眼中。如何能使歐美人士認識日本的文明。在日本看來自有設法進行的必要。由於這大前提。日本對世界的政策。也必分野。對歐美文明國家。芷如蘇聯代表這次在太平洋會議中所說。「不願採用武力。」因為歐美非落後區域。與日本一樣的原故。而對於東亞。「日本不惜採用武力。」因為是落後區域。而日本負有開發落後區域責任的原故。於是對西歐。我們見到日本文部省有文化使節派遣的提議。不但此也。我們還見到「日本文化協會」預備於一九四〇年。在東京召集一東西文化綜合會議。聘請威爾斯太戈爾基德呼柴爾等世界名人。出席參加討論。這也是一個空前盛舉。這會議能否成事實。那自然又是一問題。不過我相信凍西文化不會由這幾個名人的討論。而就有什麽成果。如果世界經濟的本質沒有變更。而世界仍然是分裂成為侵略者與被侵略者這兩個陣營。我相信東方與西方。仍將如英帝國詩人吉卜齡所歌詠的一樣。「東方是東方。」而「西方是西方。」其中也許有一點。日本可以達到他的目的。那就是召來這些名人。可以認識日本為東方文明國家。和王道主義的首創者。可是其中如基德與威爾斯。並不是怎樣落後的人。也許對日本這樣偉大的使命。有些望而却步吧。</p>
<p>其對中國。那末自然要盡其所謂開拓落後區域的責任。經濟開發華北。是其重要使命之一。而文化政策的相輔而行。又必為其必要步驟之一。我們會聽到在天津濟南。有設立產業研究所之舉。我們也聽到在北平擬在國立各大學設立日本語與文化講座的企圖。我們也聽到在上海有設立圖書館之企圖。最近消息。日本對華文化事業。因日本國內各方面的要求。方針已稍有改變。那就是直接對於民衆經濟上增加福利。而以文化的福利與之相輔而行。以經濟開發為前提。而以文化灌輸隨之。惜乎我們這「落後區域」的人民。對於「先進國」這一番「好意。」還不能不有所顧慮呢。</p>

<p>此次據瑪德里消息、東路德魯埃爾城附近之叛軍、昨被官軍擊敗、薩拉哥薩與德魯埃爾兩城間之鐵路因而切斷、陸軍部幷宣稱、官軍在西路埃斯脫拉瑪杜爾省大見進展、京北瓜達拉瑪山之陣地亦已更形鞏固、（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法屬摩洛哥拉巴港　關於西班牙南部戈爾杜巴城一帶戰况、該國官方與叛軍方面所發消息顯然矛盾、據瑪德里來訊、謂政府軍經十二小時劇戰之後、當經佔領山頭一座村鎭一處、其地可以控制戈爾杜巴城云、但據塞維爾城叛軍無綫電台發出消息、則謂紅軍（指官軍）進攻戈爾杜巴城、早在預料之中、革命軍準備禦戰業已多日、迨至本日紅軍果來相犯、當由我方空軍將其逐退、我方陸軍亦卽出城反攻、幷與城外開來之援軍相會合、致將官軍擊敗、敵方受創甚重、棄尸二十五具而潰退云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>叛軍戰艦猛轟桑城</h3>
<p>桑塞巴斯蒂城　本日有叛軍所屬萬噸巡洋艦「加拿里」號、（此艦尙係新近落成者）自費洛兩港開來、向該砲轟兩次、上午轟擊時僅有四彈落於城中、下午則於三時三十分轟擊、其勢較猛、致肇重大損失、惟死傷人命若干、現尙未悉、該城本日雖受砲轟、但城內人心初未感覺恐慌、反之、守軍敵愾之心固益形奮發、卽若干居民之於官軍叛軍兩方、本不作左右袒者、今亦多同情於官軍方面矣、此外、據西班牙蒲爾哥城消息、叛軍所屬巡洋艦「塞佛拉上將、號本日在海上遇見巨大貨船一艘滿載子彈、係顯接濟官軍者、然卽加以奪佔、並卽將輪駛往基雄港乏、叛軍當局限制居戶用水、每戶每隔五日僅能分得五公分云、（二十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>意大利勞工概况</h3>
<p>— 朱學範</p>
<p>意大利自一九二二年十月二十八日法西斯黨進軍羅馬，墨來里尼執政以後，墨氏卽運用共大刀闊斧之手腕，施有獨裁制度。舉凡一切黨政，經濟之改弦更張，社曾建設之積極推行，迄茲十有四年，其成續之斐然，已為世所公認。至其勞工政策，於法西斯統治之下，頗多發展。茲特於旅意期間，對於勞工情况，就調查所得，略述一二，以供國人從事工人運動者有所參考。</p>
<p>（一）勞工政策　意大利在一九二二年之前，工廠生產，頗不發達。工人時受共產黨之煽惑為共產黨所利用，每作罷工示威運動，以實行其破壞手段。以是造成工人失業之增加，工人生計之艱屯，而影響所及，有害於國家社會之治安者，實至深鉅。自墨索里尼執政後，卽頒佈勞働大戀章，在勞資台作互助原則之下，共同努力於生產事業之發展。廠方不得以關廠為對付工人之手段，工人亦不得以罷工為要挾行為。同時訂立勞資契約，規定最低工資及及工作時間，休息時間，各項假期等等。勞資雙方均須絕對遵守，如有一方觸犯勞働大憲章時，則政府卽加以處罰。因此勞資糾紛事件，驟形减少，不僅工人生計得有保障，卽工廠生產亦普遍增加。</p>
<p>（二）工人組織　現時意大利有組織之工人共二，二〇四，二七五人，分二十二業，統屬於工業全國總聯合會之下。各省分省聯合會，各縣分縣聯合會。全國總聯合會設主席一人，領導全國工運，現任主席名Tullio　Cianetli，並兼任大評議會委員之一。省會設省主席，縣會設縣主席，均由上級委任之。每一工廠則有代表一人，乃由工人所選舉者。全國總聯合會為唯一領導工人之機關，舉凡代表工人解决勞許糾紛也，訂立契約也，創辦工人福利事業也，皆為其主要之工作。但該會須受行政機關之『行業合作部』Ministry　Gi　Co-operation之指導。同時在行業合作部之下而須受指導者，復有工業僱主總聯合會。故勞資之間實具有聯繫之關係。</p>
<p>（三）工人生活　工人生活現時比較安定，每週工作四十八小時，每星期休息一天。夜工工資較日工為髙。工餘時問大都在俱樂部從事娛樂。俱樂部為黨部所領導而與工廠所合辦者，內部設有各種球類運動，音樂，擊劍，旅行，游泳，賽船，並有補習外國語言之課程等等。故余以為外國工人生活與我國工人生活，過不相若。外國工人注重運動及戶外旅行，而我國工人工餘時間，大都　居屋內，或遊藝塲所。以是外國工人身體康健，精神朗爽，反是，而我則非僅工人如是，常人亦然，殊可憂也。</p>
<p>（四）勞働法庭　勞資如遇糾粉，先由工業工人總聯合會出任調查，如無結果，則提請勞働法庭裁决。勞慟法庭係由僱主，工人專家各一人，法官一人，陪審法官二人所組織。對於所提案件，採取公正應度，根　勞働大憲章之原則，予以裁决。裁决後，雙方卽須絕對遵守。故凡勞資糾紛一旦發生，解决均甚敏捷，其效之宏，於此可見。在一九三五年度意大利勞資糾粉事件祇一百二十件，足知共勞資合作之一般矣。</p>
<p>（五）失業介紹　全國設有一失業介紹所，各省設有分所，由行業合作部領導。工人失業者，可將其年齡，技能，經騐以及家庭狀况等逕向當地介紹所登記。僱主如遇添招工人時，須向介紹所僱用，不得自行招寡。此種辦法，已為法律所規定，故僱主如不遵行，則將處以五十利耳以上至三千利耳以下之罰金，（一利耳合我國法幣五分之一）據羅馬失業介紹分所之統計，一九三六年四月份失業人數，男一〇，九五七人，女五九九人，共計一一，五五六人。經由該所介紹工作者，男六，七五三人，女五二三人，共計七，一七六人。</p>
<p>（六）勞工保險　一九二二年前，因勞工保險不甚發達之故，工人脫遇失業，疾病，殘廢等事故發生，卽感痛苦萬狀。自墨索里尼秉政後，積極提倡勞工保險制度，降至最近，其效益彰，現有國營保險局及私人經辦之保險局，專辦勞工保險。私人經營之保險局須受行業合作部及財政部之指導。至關於勞工保險之種類，計有失業保險，肺病保險，年老及殘廢保險，擴充生育保險（女工），意外保險。除意外保險費由廠主完全担負外，其餘各類保險均由勞資雙方各半担負。以失業保險而論，據一九三四年統計，收入保險費為一二〇，二二二，〇〇〇利耳，支出補助金為一〇一，三八四，〇〇〇利耳。至於肺病保險局，其設備佈置，均甚週密。現有大規模之醫院共十二所，病牀二萬二千隻。是故意大利人平素如投保各類保險，對於身前身後，均可無須牽慮矣</p>
<p>以上所述，就現時意大利勞工情况槪括言之，不足盡其詳也。至關於勞工訓練問題，則屬於整個意大利靑年訓練範圍以內，容另為文述之。二十五，七，十五，記於德國之旅邸</p>
<h3>政治謀殺圖攫政權　俄反革命犯罪在不赦　檢查官請全數判死　加米尼懺悔語動人　托姆斯基已畏罪自殺</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）關於齊諾維夫·加米尼夫·及其他反革命黨員十四人之驚人案件、今日已趨尖銳化、因各被吿皆反應檢察長判處死刑之要求、而自稱彼等皆應槍决云云、各犯只要求法庭、允彼等向工人等訣別、各被吿之態度皆相類似、茲舉一例、卽可想像其他、前紅軍司令拉卓維斯基於供認之後、卽請法庭判以死罪、以為叛變勞工階級者戒、語畢卽頹然坐下、哭泣甚哀、後由法警扶之出庭、檢察長於要求判處死刑之時、對於各犯皆加痛斥、並高聲而言曰、「此種政治謀殺犯之秘密結合、實與野獸無異、彼等必須以其頭顱、償付其背叛祖國之莫大罪惡」云云、同時又有公吿發表、謂蘇俄資格極老之工團領袖托姆斯基、因與特羅資基及齊諾維夫等恐怖主義者之反革命運動有關、無以自解、故已自殺云、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）因從事反革命活動而被控、現與其他十五人同受審訊之加米尼夫氏今日向庭上作最後致詞時、謂蘇聯今仍當取極度之防範、因特羅資基氏長此逍遙國外、渠仍將遣派秘密人員深入國境、從事恐怖行動、加氏以最後遺囑吿其三子、而願由彼等轉達全國靑年、其一子現於紅軍中任航空員、加氏囑吿三子、當愛護史丹林、而稱史氏為全世界最偉大之勞工領袖、並謂渠因破壞布爾希維克紀律、而遭殺身之禍、願全國靑年永勿蹈其獲轍、其結語曰、余不畏死、余生時旣不能為革命宣勞、今擬於臨終時稍盡厥責云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）檢察官維興斯基對特齊案演說、謂被吿之反對我社會主義祖國、其目的及罪惡實可懼可驚、此等罪人及殺人犯舉手反對共黨諸領袖、反對史丹林·伏洛希羅夫·茲達諾夫·卡昂諾維赤·奧爾卓尼斯基·庫西爾·及貝斯蒂希夫、其罪過實亦可懼可驚、此等匪徙罪大惡極、彼等已殺勞動階級英士、卽令人不忘之基洛夫是」、</p>
<p>維氏引史丹林語、「蘇聯國力之增長、將同時加強沒洛階級最後餘孽之抵抗」、指出此次審詢、又已一度證明敵人對於社會主義巨大成功之仇恨如何巨大、維氏叙述蘇聯社會主義建設之主要成功、竭力頌揚勞動大衆環繞史丹林、環繞共黨中央執行委員會及蘇維埃政府之堅固及不可破壞之團結、蘇聯人民對於卑鄙暗殺者之巨大憤怒浪潮、現正吞沒全國各地成為此種團結之「明證」、</p>
<p>維氏述及被吿犯罪性質、否認彼等企圖乃為「純正政治家之行動」、並謂「此種企圖僅為彼等政治空虛及缺乏任何理想之假面具而已、彼等非政治家、乃為暗殺犯罪及竊盜之匪徒彼等企圖刦掠國有財產—此卽彼等所為、此等紳士承認彼等並無任何計劃、但彼等實亦有其國內政策及外交政策、其國內政策可以一言說明之、卽為「殺」、而奪取政權僅為督促彼等鬥爭之一理想、過去彼等以怠工及困難、以對蘇維埃政府及黨鬥爭、現今彼等已舉其面具、承認我國社會主義勝利、此種勝利促使彼等反抗蘇維埃政府、彼等山於四顧無援、山於完全孤立、由於毫無希望採用其他手段以爭取政權、乃竟至於恐怖及暗殺、恐怖為其全部活動、亦為特齊聯合之基礎、此因一部份人並不與其秘密工作發生聯繫、而得完全證明、彼等全部憤怒及憎恨、集中於共黨及政治部諸領袖·共黨中央委員·史丹林·及共光榮武裝同志、蓋因卽在彼等領導之下、卽在史丹林領導之下、迫令特羅資基主義者之反革命趨於失敗也、特羅資基致書若干外國黨徒及暗殺者、命其殺害史丹林、彼召募黨徒組織恐怖主義行動、企圖謀殺我黨國諸領袖、特羅資基之恐怖命令、確為聯合中心各種活動展開之基碮、已可視為定論矣、特羅資基組織聯合中心及採用恐怖手段之思想、被秘密工作之特羅資基主義者所接受、齊諾維夫亦同意此種思想、接受特羅資基命令、作為聯合中心及秘密工作者之行動基礎、此次審詢中之最重要點、卽為彼等實現其反革命思想於採用恐怖主義手段之反革命事件中、彼等不僅談及槍擊、且已實行槍殺、而基洛夫卽為彼等槍殺下之犧牲」、</p>
<p>維氏說明被吿外交政策、卽為坦白希望戰敗、根據彼等口供、特羅資基曾為彼等設一目標、卽在戰爭之際、利用任何失敗以攫爭領導權、聯合並武裝不滿不眾、組織反對蘇維埃政府之叛亂、數年前特羅資基宣佈、「克萊蒙梭舉說」謂當敵人僅離莫斯科八十公里時、卽應武裝反坑蘇維埃政府、此卽彼等之「外交政策」</p>
<p>維氏稱被吿所用方法、為彼等犯罪生活中最可恥之一頁、「彼等廣泛採用騎牆政策、作為彼等對付黨及政府之主要方法、齊諾維夫會吿其黨徒謂、「當受調查之際、否認對此團體之任何聯繫、且須辯白謂恐怖與布爾塞維克主義及馬克思主義之觀點不相符合、」特羅資基亦作同樣表示、一九三三年夏、當聯合中心準備對史丹林作恐怖行動之際、齊諾維夫致函其黨中央委員會、函中彼承認過去種種錯誤、並假意宣蕃忠於社會主義及共產黨、一九三三年六月十六日齊諾維夫在眞理報發表論文、文中淋各種方法、以表示彼對黨之忠誠、痛篤機會主義、並歌頌黨所得之勝利、同年夏、彼命令見加耶夫開始實行恐怖基洛夫（卽為齊諾維夫所殺）死後、齊諾維夫在眞理報著文哀悼、謂（此萬衆愛戴之我同道之喪失、使萬衆均感失」親近及無限親愛之人）卑汚之暗殺者竟向其犧牲洒淚、維氏嘆謂、「無論何時何地、寗有何物與此相似者乎、吾復何言、吾用何字以窮究此褻凟、奸詐、騎牆主義者之全部可鄙及可憎乎、一九三三年加米尼夫在眞理報中痛責自己之錯誤、並努力證明彼已絕其舊友、同時則在召集大會討論對黨政諸領袖實施恐怖行動問題、奸詐、假態、卽為彼等犯罪行為之基本方法、」</p>
<p>維氏述及聯合中心之實際行動、及各被吿之犯罪性質、謂一九三三年秋特齊反革命團體之聯合、實以共同承認恐怖乃為爭取政權之唯一有效方法為其基礎、此種鬥爭、為當時特齊主義之之主要目標、基洛夫暗殺案之調查、並未證明加米尼夫、齊諾維夫、伊夫道其莫夫及貝加耶夫之直接參預此次暗殺雖彼時自其全部政策、業已證明彼等用假設語氣鼓動暗殺、並為之創造理由、因此一九三五年一月、對加米尼夫及齊諾維夫宣佈寬大判决、彼等竭力掩飾此次犯罪事件中之眞正組織者及同謀者、</p>
<p>維氏引用並比較齊諾維夫、加米尼夫、伊夫道基莫夫及貝加耶夫在一五三五年審訊中、及此次審訊中之詳細口供、曝露彼等如何企圖逃避創造恐怖主義中心及其全部活動之責仟、表示齊諾維夫及加米尼夫如何因共不可否認口供之碰壁、被迫脫其面具、承認彼等對於恐怖主義行動之資任、及彼等在基洛夫暗殺中與準備暗殺其他黨政領袖中之罪過、</p>
<p>維氏謂、「恐怖主義中心確曾存在、而尤重要者、乃為彼奉特羅資基可至齊諾維夫及加米尼夫之直接命令而組織、關於恐怖行動且受特羅資基直接指導、並在極端叛孽條件之下進行、利用彼等與德國法西主義者及德國「蓋斯太普」之杜卡萊夫斯基、希姆勒等個人間之關係」</p>
<p>維氏述及被吿斯米爾諸夫、謂期米爾諾夫與齊諾維夫及加米尼夫同、負責恐怖主義中心之余部活動、為全體特羅資華王義反革命團髁之建立義者及指導者、接受並傳達特羅資基關於恐怖主命令、而彼在法庭否認此等事實之種種企圖、僅為希望逃避其犯罪之責汗而已、</p>
<p>台爾梵剛揚亦為特齊中心之一員、積極參加該中心之組織、組織恐怖團體、因此對於恐怖主義各種準備工作、及基洛夫之暗殺應負責任、萊茵各爾特、畢克爾、及特萊采爾在莫斯科組織所調突擊恐怖主義中心、並謀害史丹林及伏洛希羅夫、</p>
<p>維氏繼述特羅資基所盡仟務、謂「特氏不僅為秘密結黨及準備犯罪集團之靈魂及創始者、且為特齊中心之鼓勵者·創始者及組織者、同時特羅資基親自派其若干黨徒來蘇、此等黨徒均為彼所熟識因此西道夫（特氏羅資基之子）之友奧爾堡得「蓋斯太普」之助、用一鬨都拉斯共和國公民護照、來蘇準備殺害史丹林、特氏深知　人必將失敗、故又召見爾曼優林、勸導之鼓勵之、將彼送入蘇聯、貝爾曼優林及弗列茲達維特俱為特羅資基之代理人、曾受特羅資基之試騐及訊問、此已證明、特羅資基使彼等為其代理人及恐怖主義者、由此可知特氏托付彼等之使命如何重大、先前及法庭調查中所得材料、完全絕對證明那然羅拉（德國法西主義者威茲所創恐怖團體之領袖）莫賽羅拉及其他被吿之罪狀、」</p>
<p>維氏以為陰謀黨徒之計劃任命貝卡耶夫為「OGPU」主席、以謀毀滅彼等犯罪痕跡、及齊諾維夫秘書鮑格登之自殺、乃出恐怖主義者之强迫、此等供辭亦已完全據明、</p>
<p>維氏宋謂、末日已近、吾人行將淸算彼等反對我偉大國家之巨大罪孽、彼等曾厠身吾單行伍、但永不堅决忠於社會主義道路、一悲慘及可恥之結局已在等待彼等、余等目前有危害我人民、我領導人物·鬥爭·及危害蘇聯與全世界勞動大衆領袖之罪惡·危險·頑强·野蠻·惡毒黨徒、對此奸詐敵人、余等不應憐憫、全體人民現塲怒憤憤膺、對此蘇聯人民、及全世界勞動者數千百萬慣激呼號、余應以國家檢察廳代表之資格同　附和、和以國家檢察官之厭惡憤激呼聲、余要求此等瘋犬、毫無例外、全予搶决」、（全部聽衆和以長時間之鼓掌）、（二十二日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>防治螟蟲蚜蟲和蝗蟲的有郊方法（上）</h3>
<p>— 浙江大學農學院院長吳福楨</p>
<p>農業上的害蟲種類很多，其中分佈最廣為害最大的，要算螟虫，蚜蟲和蝗蟲三種了。據中央農業實騐所的調查。。民國二十二年全國農作物所受螟患的損失，値銀一千四百七十萬元；二十三年全國棉花，因蚜蟲為害所受的損失，値銀一萬萬元；二十四年江蘇一省水稻所受螟災的損失，値銀一萬一千萬元。現在我國正力求糧食和棉花的自給，所以對於以上三種害蟲不可不盡力防治。現在就把防治牠們的有效方法，大略講一講；</p>
<p>（甲）螟蟲</p>
<p>螟蟲是水稻的害蟲。牠的名稱，各地很不統一，有的地方呌牠漂蟲，有的地方呌牠白秀蟲，有的地方呌牠鑽心蟲……各的看法不同，名稱也就互異了。</p>
<p>螟蟲有二化螟，三化螟，和大螟的區別。「「化螟」年普通發生二代，所以呌牠二化螟，三化螟一年普通發生三代，所以呌牠三化螟；大螟雖然一年發生三代，但因牠是這三種螟蟲中身體最大的一種，所以呌牠大螟。牠們的種類雖然不同，但是牠們的生活習性，和為害狀况，却大都相似，所以防治的方法，也差不多是一樣的。現在因為節省時間起見，且把三種之中為害最大的三化螟蟲作代表，來講述一下</p>
<p>（一）螟蟲的一生</p>
<p>螟蟲是完全變態的昆蟲。牠的一生，有卯，幼蟲，蛹和成蟲四個時期。卵產在殃葉和稻葉的上面，每三四十粒到百餘粒重疊排列而成一塊，上蓋棕黃色的鱗毛，外表好像半粒大豆。由卵蛹化出來的幼蟲，經過、一個多月，脫皮五次，就變成蛹，再過五六日，就變為成蟲—就是螟蛾。如此循環生長，一年中可以完成三代。牠的第三代幼蟲，等到稻都老熟了，天氣也漸漸冷了，就潛伏在稻根裏過冬。再等到來年五月上中旬，天氣漸漸熱了，秧亦長大了，再化蛹變蛾，飛到秧田裏在秧葉上產卵。卵孵化出來的幼蟲，就鑽入秧莖，秧苗因此就變黃而枯死；這就是第一化。到了七月中句，第二化幼蟲發生，這時稻田裏被害的枯心稻，往往成為一個一個的圓集團，其大小好像農人載的笠帽，所以農民稱牠為笠帽瘟。到了八月中旬，第三化幼蟲發生，這時稻正當抽穗，被牠蛀食後的稻，就成白穗、因此有螟蟲和沒有螟蟲的稻田，是非常容易分辨的。螟蟲的繁殖力很強，這也就是牠為害厲害的緣故。我們假定每一個螟蛾產一百粒卵為標準，雌雄各半計算，到了第三化，就可繁殖到二十五萬條螟蟲。所以春季秧田中假使殘留了幾個螟蛾，到了秋天，普遍的稻田，就只看見白穗了。</p>
<p>（二）螟蟲的有效防治方法</p>
<p>防治螟蟲的方法很多，現在且把有效的並且容易實行的講幾種：</p>
<p>（一）除卵　除卵，就是把螟蛾產在秧葉或稻葉上的卵塊連葉折下燒毀的意思。除卵可分三期舉行：第一期是秧田採卵。不過秧田採卵，傳江南一帶舊式秧田裏沒有人行道，是很難實行的。所以要秧田採卵，必須先厲行合式秧田。合式秧田的做法，就是把稻種播成四尺闊的長條，每兩佃長條中間空一尺闊的路，以便採卵時行走。等到五月上旬，秧苗長到三四寸高的時候，就要到秧田裏巡視，如發現卵槐，隨時就採去。採卵的人，必須隨帶一根棒和一個布袋，在向陽光的一面，用棒輕輕撥動秧葉，仔鈿觀看，慢慢前進，見有卵塊，就採入布袋。等到採完，就聚而燒掉。秧田採卵，每隔三日至少須舉行一次。採卯這工作，非常簡單，只要目力好的並能在水田裏行走的，差不多都能勝任。不過兒童的體軀適度，眼睛鋎利，作這工作，格外來得適宜，做家長的應當好好利用的。秧田採卵難免遺漏，所以到了七月中旬第二化卵塊發生，和八月上旬第三化卵塊發生的時候，更應該舉行本田採卵，這就是第二第三期的採卵，本田採卵的方法和秧田採卵一樣，不過面積大了，工作比較費時些，並且每日都要採一次。</p>
<p>（二）除幼蟲　螟蟲的幼蟲在稻根中過冬，上面已經講過，所以除幼蟲的方法，最好實行冬季掘稻根，把稻根全部掘出毀掉，其中潛伏的幼蟲，就可弄死了。掘稻根沒有特別的方法，就是在稻割掉後還沒有種下作前，用鋤頭或鍫掘起，再選擺下列各法加以處理，。</p>
<p>（一）把稻根與河泥層層相疊成堆，四週再用河泥封蓋，等到稻根腐敗以後，便作肥料。</p>
<p>（二）掘一深坑，把稻根埋入坑中，腐敗後亦作肥料用。</p>
<p>（一）與乾稻草相混，堆積田中，點火燒掉。</p>
<p>（四）把稻根晒乾充燃料</p>
<p>除掉掘稻根殺幼蟲方法之外，還有一種灌水浸殺法。就是不種下作的稻田，水利又很便利的地方，灌水入田，使潛伏在稻根裏的幼蟲，窒息而死。灌水深淺，以淹沒稻根為適度。灌水時期，要在二個月以上。</p>
<p>（三）除蛾　除蛾的方法，最好在秧田時期舉行。一方面用捕蟲綱捕殺，一方面利用螟蛾的慕光習性，在秧田旁點燈誘殺，這燈呌做誘蛾燈，裝置很簡單，普通可在田梗上設三脚架，懸一强光的美孚燈，燈下放一直抓的三尺的圓盆，盆內注水半滿，並滴火油數點，燈與盆的距離約七八寸，與地面的距離的力六尺。每日晚間七時到十二時，把燈點着，螟蛾看見燈光，就會飛集燈下，落水沾油而死。普通每畝田點燈一盞，如螟蛾發生太多的時候，應該酌量增加數盞，以增效果。</p>
<p>以上所述的治螟方法，如果能按步實行，則螟患一定可以消除，不過還應該往意三點：</p>

<p>本市旅業同業公會、為討論額外小帳問題、昨日下午三時、假座市商會常會室召開臨時會員大會、到市黨部代表王龍章·市商會代表袁鴻鈞·及中央·南京·東方·爵祿·神州·等旅館代表二百餘人、主席團陳聞達·孫秋屛·嚴蓉卿、鄭重討論、認為取締額外小帳、除客人自願賞賜外、原亦不准職工額外取索、惟實施辦法中、規定不得收取保證金及客人賞給小帳、轉交作航空捐等萬難接受、同時職工亦聯名呼籲、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席陳聞達致開會詞云、今日召開臨時大會、蒙上級代表及各同業踴躍出席、不勝榮幸、此次召集臨時大會、是要討論有關於同業生存的一個重要問題、就是現在喧傳社會、由新運促進會所倡議的取消各業額外小帳問題、並且已通過實施辦法草案、吾人對於取締額外小帳、在原則上自不能加以誹議、可是就事實上加以審察、則此取締額外小帳問題、是社會多種原因所構成、極為錯綜複雜、必須對於事實上之困難、兼籌並顧、予以補救、否則非徒無裨實際、恐將引起勞資間重大糾紛、我國工商業之不振、從事商店營業之困難、職工生計之艱苦、以及因商店淸理倒閉、增加職工失業之恐慌、這都是無可諱言的事實、為什麽要有額外小帳、因為無固定工資、或者工資甚為微薄、不得不恃客人所賞賜的小帳、以資挹注、何以無固定工資、難道資方從中剝削以自肥嗎、不、絕對不是、就現在同業情形而論、可以保百分之九十以上、是要虧本的、自肥什麽呢、反觀職工的生活、尚甚安定、此有事實可證、故資方的生存、尤較勞方為迫切、要取締額外小帳、當然職工要足以維持最低生活之工資、資方卽要增加鉅大的開支、而鉅大的開支、勢不得不取償於增加賣價上、可是社會消費能力、日趨低落的現在、只看見忍痛拍賣大减價來吸引顧客、要增加賣價、那不啻與社會背道而馳的開倒車、增加賣價、旣是不可能、試問資方有什麽方法來維支這鉅額負擔呢、資方不能維持而至歇業、職工又怎麽生活呢、所以必須要在共存共榮的原則上、妥商一個兼籌並顧的方法、事實上對於額外小帳、同業向來自動取締、其因茶房侍候殷勤、得顧客歡心而賞賜的、則同業亦無從干涉、因額外小帳、本無規定、如果茶役有絲毫勒索行為、則得罪於客人、店方營業、亦受影響、當然要嚴予糾正、至於店方僱用茶房、其待遇條件、及保證金等、本係僱用間一種契約、經雙方同意而訂立的、凡經雙方合意的行為、就是合乎法律的行為、吾人深恐積習固當改革、對於新生活運動、亦當盡力推行、但必須要共存共榮、及减少糾紛為出發點、祗要店方能勉强維持生存之最低限度、無不樂於接受、並不希望盈餘、請大家貢陳高見、共商妥善辦法為幸、</p>
<p>决議經過</p>
<p>主席報吿畢、復由上級代表分別致詞、旋卽依照開會秩序、開始討論、為鄭重起見、由主席將新運促進會取締額外小帳、通過實施辦法　項、逐條宣讀、復由到會會員、逐一加以硏究、最後　納意見、為我旅業對職工除顧客自願賞給之小帳、充作航空捐、事關業務存在及職工生計、萬難接受、乃决議　由執委會將大會意見及旅業痛苦情形、分別呈請市黨部市政府社會局鑒核、　推張志　·孫秋屛·嚴容　·姚頌平·陳聞達·丁馨·李文才·孫文照·周伯堯·等為出席新運會代表、陳述旅業痛苦情况、</p>

<p>世運會給獎儀式</p>
<h3>世運田徑裁判及設備之片斷</h3>
<p>— 江良規寄自柏林</p>
<p>十一屆世運會在柏林郊外的國家運動中、勝肅熱烈地的開幕了、記者從二萬四千里外的故國、繞了地球的半佃圈子、從亞洲經過菲洲、趕到歐洲乘躬了興盛典、這是一件多麽欣幸的事情、</p>
<p>整個的亞林匹克全規模的偉大、辦事的週到、眞是出乎我們意料之外的、不論是那方面、在任何時緊張局面下、我們從沒有過到什麽手脚失措、慌張混亂的情形、職員人數極少、可是他們却都盡量的利用他們的工作效力、而達到人盡其才的條件了、在辦事方面、都覺得有報告的價値、以供故國體育同人之參考、可是這是决不可能的、現在先就第一日內在田徑塲上所見到的世運會的側面、從體育界的立塲、照與國內同人討論幾個小問題、</p>
<p>跳高</p>
<p>躍過後從橫木下穿過、不作犯規、這是一件人家所不注意的事情，可是記者發現後、却覺得非常的快慰、過去在國內服務時、就為了這件事、所發生的糾紛很多很多、有許多的體育界同人、執行田徑賽裁判時、總有這來一條說「跳高及撑竿跳高之運動員、於躍過橫竿後、而再從橫竿下穿過跑回者作為失敗論、」其實這一條條文、在規則裏、並無登載、可是大家以訛傳訛地幾乎一體遵行了、所以這次世運會裏、就特別注意這一點、好在第一次就是跳高、結果、我發現了多數運動員、於躍過橫木後、幾乎皆從橫木下跑回、裁判員孰視之如無規、當然我們可以信任、這次不是裁判員之疏忽、而為規則上並無這一條條文了、我數年所常常懷疑的、得了滿意的答覆，同時，在國內與記者有同感的也不在少數、此後對於這條例外　規則、可以有一個同一的辦法了、</p>
<p>跳高之丈量</p>
<p>（一）每次增加之高度這也是一件槍不統一的事情、每次在國內的運動會、從沒有聽到　跳高高度的增加規定、各行其素而漫無定例、當然、每次高度增加的不一例、對於運動員是决沒有利益的、此次世運會、正式比賽的起跳度為一公尺八十五、每次增加·〇三公尺（三生的米突）、我覺得這是一件很適當的高度、在現模較小的運動會裏、起跳的高度、不妨稍减底、增加的高度却可以一例、（二）高度的丈量　高度的丈量、是一件很麻煩而很不易準確的事情、此次大會裏所採用的方法、是比較的準確而簡便、同時也很經濟、很可以模仿、（國內也有用此法的、但並不普過）法用三角木一、長約二公尺三十、下設木座、木質極堅、上刻高度、以　為單位、每次量高度時、僅需將高度木置於橫水上從平行綫視出高度、</p>
<p>標槍</p>
<p>（一）失誤的傳達、標槍的投擲、距離較遠、同時使綫裁判及距離裁判、必須彼此互通聲氣、每一運動員投擲後、使綫者必須告知使距離者知悉、若無適當訊號、而用揚聲筒傳達時、裁判員旣易於感到疲乏、同時塲上聲音煩雜、易使觀衆精神不快、比賽時可用紅白旗各一、運動員投擲後、如不越綫、舉白旗以示信、丈量者卽可丈量、如越綫可舉紅旗、此法不但使裁判員不易誤會、而且可以使全塲觀衆一目了然、</p>
<p>（二）擲槍者本人取回標槍擲出下地後、運動員向前趨勢已定、乃由本人跑去取回、（此項辦法之利益在减少塲上人數、避免危險、同時使其知悉自巳之距離、其法雖屬可取、然在規模較小、運動會日期短促、人數衆多、時間經濟的情形下、不宜使用、</p>
<p>裁判員</p>
<p>（一）各項運動員山各該項裁判員負資帶出塲外、這是一件最使我滿意的地方、國內每次舉行運動會時、我們最感覺困難的是塲上秩序的不容易維持、每次舉行運動會時、不是有許多褂名的職員、閒步塲中、東張西望、便是許多退伍的運動員、（項目已結速成羣結隊往來不絕、運動會之進行旣然影響、觀衆視綫也為之阻碍、此次大會之辦法極佳、各項運動員於規定時間在點名處點名、由担任各該項裁判員列隊領入塲內、該項比賽全部結束、再由該項裁判員列隊鎖出塲外、所以塲中决無空閒的職員參觀比賽、也無退伍的運動員東奔西跑、秩序井然、</p>
<p>（二）發會員的服裝、發會員對於成績最有影響、此次世這會照發會員之服裝、與一般裁判員不同、着白色大衣、如醫生般、極顯明、運動員、觀衆裁判員、均能一目了然、</p>
<p>（三）終點裁判台、該台與國內見者不同、國內所見者，大半多有二公尺闊、每級能坐三人、此地則不同、台極狹、每級僅能坐二人、此法較為進步、因一級上同時坐三人、則僅有一人取得最準確視綫、其他二人多少總有些不同、每級僅坐」人、則每人均在最優異之地位、</p>
<p>距離標記</p>
<p>用六面形木塊而不用小旗、因鉛皮旗僅能使兩方觀衆看見、六面形方木則四方觀眾皆能看見、</p>
<p>成績報吿</p>
<p>（一）比賽進行時、田賽項目之在進行中者、每次投擲均行立刻報告、其法於塲之四角各設報告牌兩塊於地面上、一為運動員之號碼牌、一為成績牌、每角有兩人使其事、各角皆有電話機、每次運動員投擲時、號碼先行報告、成績亦隨卽標出、進行極快、全塲覜衆均可知曉各該連動員每次投攬之確實距離、</p>
<p>（二）徑賽之成績於每次結束後、在總報告牌上報告、錄取各人之成績均行標出、</p>
<p>照相</p>
<p>此次徑賽項目、於每次賽完五分鐘內、終點照相卽行洗出、辦事極速、故照槍設備不能不力求完備、然又須不妨碍觀衆、辦法頗佳、在終點附碍、及田賽塲左右挖掘地窟、近出地面一尺、照相機置地窟內、地位旣佳又不妨碍觀衆視綫、</p>

<h3>正風中學　訓管新計劃</h3>

<p>今校創立之初、正常學風囂張士氣隳疲之秋、而本校立校宗旨、亦卽欲於此舉世滔滔之萬惡潮流中、發抒其獨特之精神、實現其獨特之理想、正風二字之所以被采為本校校名者、蓋以此故、顧自創校十年以來、社會之病熊依然、辦學之效力未顯、雖本校辦學同志以及闈校學生、能於共同研討共同砥礪之生活環境中、頻作其風雨之鷄鳴、然而道高一尺、魔高一丈、個人之努力、終不敵社會之推移、本校精神之所以未能引起社會注意者、此亦一大原因、一年以　、本校畏對此問題、會加以深刻之研究、並會邀請本校各級教師、以及各地教育專家、提供意見、央同檢时、綜合公衆意見、僉謂社會之勢力固大、而學校陶冶學生之未臻至善、亦仍為原因中之一種、在學校立塲言、仍須於此痛下功夫、本校是建其言、爰經决定自下學期起，於學校行政系統中、設置一學生生活指導委員會、與訓育處並行、共負學校訓育之全責、大約訓育處所負使命、屬於消極一方面、生活指導委員會所負使命、屬於積極一方面、換言之、卽由訓宵處與生活指導委員會兩機關、對學生生活之全部、實施一種硬性之統制方法而已，此種生活統制之科學根據、卽在依據生理學及心理學之研究結果、將學生平時生活、作成合理之編配、如讀書時間之長短、睡眠休息之多少、以友游戲作業之成分等等、均作有規律之劃分、準此方法、則學生在校這時、對於本身生活、已能遵守鋼紀規律、將來出校以後、或能以其索習、矯正社會、本校立校精神、庶幾得以發揚光大、丁此實行之初、深望各界人士予以嚴正之批評及合理之指導云云、</p>

<p>粤省幣制，向極複離，近軍因習用二角毫幣及毫洋券為交易之媒介，允增金融上無窮糾紛、蓋豪洋在外匯上未取得地位，其價格常常發生動搖，市面一切宗買賣，胥以香港紙幣為授受之標準，以故港幣之信用愈固，而毫幣之基礎益弱，其價格之變動，動輒影響工商百業，甚至牽及農村經濟，凡熟悉粤省情形者，莫不知港幣實把握全省經濟之命脈，此在平時而論，粤省固已有亟改大洋制之必要。自去歲中央施行法幣政策以來，粤省當局卽乘機澀發紙幣，初於去年十一月間以財政廰名義，發佈集中白銀命令，規定以白銀毫洋一元調換毫券一元二角，大洋一元調換亳劵一元四角四分，欲藉此法以大量吸收白銀，並以彌補府庫空虛，囊時財廳積欠經費？均用紙幣淸發，兩廣異動以後，軍費支出膨脹，紙幣濫發之數目，更不易估計，幣價陡跌，市面恐慌，所有現銀除準備保管委員會所保存者外，非藏匿民間，卽逃避港市，幾於造成不可收拾之紊亂，此又粤省紙幣因目前迫切需要而不能不亟改大洋制者也。</p>
<p>（二）改制問題</p>
<p>查此次中央改革粤省幣制，以維護粤省人民法益及避免政府過重負擔為主要原則。故事先必須統籌兼顧，採取慚進步騾，以期於一定時斯中達到穩定金融，統一幣制之目的，而於草擬計劃時，允當注意以下之　點：</p>
<p>（一）發行新法幣數額問題：</p>
<p>（二）新法幣與毫洋劵折合比率問題；</p>
<p>（三）債權者與債務者間之·係問題。</p>
<p>（三）改制計劃</p>
<p>查粤省發行紙幣數額及其白銀存量，尚無確實公告。據軍載發行總額為二萬五干萬元，現金準備的合毫洋一萬零七百萬元。保證準備進有省發庫券九千二百餘萬元，但該項庫券，目前旣無市價，亦無信用，自難認為確實。故改制計劃，第一步須切實檢杳準備性質及發行額數，以為規定新幣發行額之準則。惟參閱各方紀載，粤省發行紙幣數額，與上述數目相去不遠，今姑假定此數以為擬訂改革計劃之標準。</p>
<p>（甲）第一步計劃</p>
<p>（一）設立中央銀行廣東分行發行大法幣一萬二千萬元也。粤省現存白銀，的共値毫洋一萬〇七白萬元，以加二折合大洋計算，（粤省毫幣，品類複雜，成色不一，若以其所含純銀量與大洋折算，諸感困難，故擬仿照上海小洋十二角折合大洋一元之市價比算）約値八千九白一十餘萬元，今擬第一步發行法幣一萬二千萬元，是現銀準備，已達百分之七十以上，其餘百分之三十之保證準備，可以中央公債撥充，如此則基礎可稱鞏固，信用自必日增。</p>
<p>（二）規定以大洋法幣一元折合毫劵一元六角之比率，逐漸收回毫券一萬九千二百萬元也。查粤省發行毫券總額的為二萬二五千萬元，現銀準備約為一萬〇七百萬元，是亳券一元僅値原來銀角四角三分左右，若以加二比率折算，僅合大洋一角六分，今以一元六角之比率折合大洋法幣，是毫券一元等於大洋六角三分，已比原來佔定價格增高百分之七十五。</p>
<p>然說者或以為加六乏比率未免太高，粤省人民損失過重。不知粤省自財廳頒佈收買白銀法令以後，毫券價値已低落至原來十二分之，卽等於亳洋八角二分左右，再以加二比牽折算，僅合大洋六角九分四僜四毫，今擬定毫券改換大洋法幣之比率為十六比十，卽亳券一元等於大洋六角二分五蘆，是改制以後毫券之實際價格適等於未改制時百分之九十，</p>
<p>果，仍無少異。以粵省紙幣之紊亂，而改革以後，竟得有如此結果，粵民卽使損失百分之十，一經政府明白斛釋，已屬喜出望外，尚何敢有所皆議战。</p>
<p>或謂粤省毫洋與大洋匯率，常為加三左右，此次改制，其折合率亦應定為加二，方得公允。不知粤省毫洋與大洋匯牽，年來常在加三五（卽百分之三十五）至加四之間，卽在粤省此次異動以前，亦常出入於加二八至加四一之間，今姑假定為加三八，與新幣制加六相比，其價格亦不過比原來低落百分乏十三·七五，其計算式如左：</p>
<p>反之，若定亳劵與大洋之比率為上三比十，是改制以後，亳券價格反比原來較高，不特於理未合，目適足予投機者以操縱之機，而中央政府反負担　重，謂為得計，其誰信之。</p>
<p>總視以上所迦，如照加六之比率，以逐海收回毫券，則粤民之損失並不過重，而中央政府亦得以措置裕如，實為兩全之道也。</p>
<p>（三）規定法幣償還債務辦法也。查粤省在未施行法幣以前，毫洋與毫劵同樣流通，迨地方當局假法幣之名，以行膨脹之實，規定毫洋一元値法幣亳券一元二角，於是亳洋與亳券間價格，乃發生差異。政府一方利用此法以吸收白銀，一方又規定債務者得以法幣照面額償還債務，其辦法實根本矛盾。不過其時政府亟欲收集白銀，不能不用升水辦法，一方又因法幣與銀幣自來價格相等，若强令債務者加二償付，造成額外損失，必然發生糾紛。反之，當債權者以欵出貸時，除少數例外者外，均係以毫劵授受，此來彼往，固兩無虧累。惟中央此次改革粤省幣制，財其情勢巳逈異　時。蓋因近數月來亳券濫發愈甚，其價格購買能力）與去歲十一月以前大相懸殊，將來新法幣發行後，毫券之與毫洋，同為貨幣以外之一種貨物，自不能不分定價格，以別等差。同理：則對於去歲十一月三日以前所發生之債樺債務，自不能與該日以後所發生者相比，故新幣制在粤施行後，以法幣償還債務，至少應規定以下辦法四項：</p>
<p>（一）自信幣制施行之日起，所有一切公司交易，存放，發欵，納稅及償還債務等項，均應以大洋法幣授受。</p>
<p>（二）凡在民國二十四年十月月三日以前所發生之一切公私債務，其契的或章則內，載明應以銀毫（卽毫洋）償付者：以大洋法幣償付時，其折合傘應定位大洋法幣一元，折合毫洋一元四角西分。</p>
<p>（三）由民國二十四年十一月三日起所發生之一切公私債務，其契的或章則內，載明應以毫洋法幣償付或幷無規定者，以大洋法幣償付時，其折合比率，應定為大洋法幣一元元折合毫洋法幣一元六角。</p>
<p>（四）凡依租賃，委任，或雇傭等關係而發生之一切公私債務，除雙方別有訂定者外，不問其債務是否繼續，應以其訂立契的之日，為其債務發生之日。</p>
<p>（乙）第二步計劃</p>
<p>（一）發行整理廣東金融庫券四千萬元盡量吸收亳券也。查粤省發行亳洋紙幣的為二萬五千萬元，除以大洋法幣調換一萬九千二百萬元外，尚餘五千八百萬元，此項毫券。擬發行整理廣東金融庫券大洋四千萬元，伊照加六之比率，逐步收回，預計除手續費及折扣等外，的可吸收毫劵六千萬元。至是毫劵全部消滅，幣制　歸統一。</p>
<p>（二）繼續發行大洋幣一千萬元收買民間白銀也。新幣制施行後，的經六個月，如基礎已臻穩固，卽可繼續囊行法幣三千萬元，以收買民間白銀。查粤省農村及各大都市存銀估計，的尚有數千萬元，如繼續發行法幣，必可盡量吸收，共比率可規定法幣一元合毫銀一元二角。白銀集中後，卽以全數撥充法幣準備金，則法幣信用當愈形鞏固矣。</p>
<p>（四）新幣制對於各方面之　影響</p>
<p>（一）對於外匯之影響新幣制施行以後，全國幣制統一，法幣政策之效用，得以同時在粤省表現，粤省對外匯兌，自必日趨平穩，非若囊時之閃爍不定。而香港紙幣之勢力，亦必逐漸削减，可無疑義。查中央自施行法幣政策以來，法幣對港幣之匯率，常為九一·五左右，而粤省近數年來毫幣對港幣之比率，除變態者外，亦常動盪於加一五至加五之間，其間蓋出入甚大，工商業者所負擔之危險實深。改制以後，則粤省商人因外匯之穩定，不特可免危險負擔，且可直接購買外匯，免除外國商行之剝削，减少匯換上種種虧損，實有白利而無一　也。</p>
<p>（二）對於物價之影響　新幣制施行以後，外滙旣　平穩，洋貨價格，自必日漸安定，而土貨價格則因南北之交通前便利，幣制復腣統一，流通較易，價格自半。至於物價之起跌，在改制前後一兩個月，雖小免竣半變動，惟經過一定期間，亦必漸復常態。今試設一例以明之。例如：上海出產甲項貨物，廣州出產乙項貨一物，甲乙兩項貨物，在上海價格局為大洋一元一，在廣州價格同為毫洋一元四角；粤省改制以後，廣州兩項物價，均漲至大洋一元，合毫券一元六角，驟觀之，物價似已上漲，實則此爾項貨物之交換比率，仍為一與一之比，粤滬商人，兩無虧累。惟一般消費者（實際上係毫劵持有人）當其以毫券一元六角，調換大洋法幣一元時，不免損失百分之十，卽此種損失，實際上亦終必歸諸於毫券持有人，而與消費者無關。一般恃薪俸報酬等收入以為生活者，其收入之數額雖顯異於前時，惟其生活之程度，則仍無變史，此又不待　而自明者也。</p>
<p>（三）對於工商業及財政之影響新幣制施行以後，粤省物價日漸安定，外滙亦趨平穩，打開前此紊亂不可收拾之局面，免除對外貿易之危險，則投者者自必踴躍，金融活動，信用發展，行見工商日趨　達，稅源日趨豐裕，稅及自必　而增加。且粤省財用　竭，幣制複雜，實為其主因之一。此次改制以後。幣制旣經統一，則可减少匯換上種械虧耗收支上種種周折，不時收入不至减少，計政上允得無窮便利也。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>總上而倫，粤省此次改革幣制，所以安定物價，平衡外滙，統一幣制，調劑金融，實為目前迫切需要。至其改革辦法，自當以維護人民法益，及减輕政府負擔為不二原則。一方宜發行相當數量，法幣，以適麻當前需要，逐步廢除亳洋；一方宜規定適當亳洋折台法幣比率，以便利工商交易，並解除債券糾紛；最後更宜盡量集中白銀，徹底消滅毫劵，以完成完國統一的法幣政策。斯不過改革計劃中之犖犖大端，至於精確數目及詳密辦法，則須經相當時間之調查研究，而後始能言之　　也。</p>

<h3>整理粵幣之關鍵</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>經濟日益進展，商業日益頻繁，則對於穩定貨幣（StableMoney）之需要日亟。良以貨幣為價値之尺度，而商業交易，僅為價値之轉移而已。雖然，所謂貨幣穩定之觀念，隨時代之進　而日新月異，往昔自由金本位之時，僉認保持貨幣金屬之重量與與成色之不緩為貨幣穩定。歐戰前後，各國濫發紙幣，漫無限制，故有倡準備金穩定說者。斯時外滙率見起　落，若干學者乃文將外匯率之穩定與貨幣穩定混為一談。最前進之貨幣穩定說者，當推美之費休（LrringFisher）氏，氏倡言貨幣穩定應以物價安定位基準，齊此刻影響於國民經濟至鉅且大也。至貨幣金屬重量及成色之固定與乎準備金之穩定，在管理的不兌換紙幣本位下，已外滙意義：有之，則僅為心理上之因牽而已。外滙GustarCassel）氏之貨幣購買力平價說匪謬，則滙價云者，兩國或多國間物價之反映而已。故捨物價穩定而求匯價穩定，是緣木求魚必不可得也。反之，若各經濟單位間之物價均吿穩定擇其間櫃率之穩定，不求可得天。</p>
<p>吾人研究整理粤省幣制問題時，亦必須從此點出發。否則差以毫厘，謬以千里，問題終難獲得正確解决。夫統一發行，設立中央銀行廣州分行，集中準備諸項，均為技術的問題，行之匪艱。今日最大之難題，厥為粵幣折合國幣之比率問題，蓋此有待乎理論之探討與乎實靑之脗合也。用將近日諸家意見加以研討，並略抒管見，俾資當軸者參考焉。</p>
<p>（一）滙兌傾銷說　於此請先就黃元彬氏之說加以研究，蓋黃氏係以「貨幣穩定」標榜者也。黃氏極力非難貨幣重景及成色之穩定，以及準備金之穩定，其眼光似直射於匯價上。關於粵幣與國幣比率，氏主張一最好以施行前一兩星期之平均比率為比率，定位加五與加六間之一點。」此種論調，不無可庇議之處。蓋短期間之變動，袛可視為非常態之變動。如去年粵幣與　幣間，會一度昇至九成與平換，而最近跌至加五與加六，均係一種投機活動現象。黃氏之寗取加五與加六而不取九成與平換，據謂係着眼於粵民經濟福利所致。氏並具體指出：「由生產，貿易，僑欵，農工商言之，所定比率宜低。」此其為言，殊嫌籠統。蓋細考之，吾國成產事業，有待於外國機器與原料之輸入極殷，比率低則生產成本亦高，未必可於舶來品競爭。貿易方面，則壓低値獎勵輸出抵制輸人，亦未必有利，苟非極端的國家經濟主義者不能否認之。其也者項亦可類推，茲不贊。目不佞以為黃敎授理侖最大錯誤為：（一）將粤幣低抑與國幣低抑昆為一談：（二）忽視粤省與其他諸省之物價平衝關係。黃氏因有第一項錯誤，故認粤幣貶價卽為國幣貶價，因而可收貶幣傾銷之利。黃氏理論之核心卽在乎此，故筆者擬之為匯兌銷銷說。然吾人必須明瞭，粤幣眨價，未必卽可獲得貶價之效，反先蒙受貶値之害。何以言之？粤幣貶値之實施係對國內而言，迨經貶値後，卽加入「國幣集團（Chinese紹DollarBloc）。斯時粤省經濟能否收貶値之效，須視國幣之動向而定。如國幣仍然維持今日之比率，則粤省仍無何種利益可言。反之，如粤幣定於加而·三之間或甚至半換，則於加入「國幣果國」伐，如國幣行低貶之策（如惟持於一先令之間），則粤省亦可獲得由低幣値之和，如他省然。就其流幣方面而言，如比率决定於加六（卽粤幣元六角折合國幣一元），較諸常熊時期之加二，每出加四。若實行此種政策，則粤省財產及人民所得，卽損失四分之一，政府稅收亦作同樣之低降。未獲其利，先受其害，其斯之謂歟！黃氏文中雖會指出歐戰後各國貨幣貶値之趨勢，而不知此僅係各國匯兌戰爭之一種手段。今我粤亳之比率問題，係對國內而言，豈黃氏尚　國內滙價杌隍程度之不深刻化而侶國內各省之　兌戰耶？抑有進者，歐戰後執世界金融牛耳之英國·亦行Revaluation之政策，恢復　價於昔日之水準，專致力謀國內物價之安定。同時低貶半價五分之一之法國，今日猶談虎色變·品車可鑒。且如今日低抑粤幣，他日再行低抑國幣，則粤民受雙重損失，怨聲史深。黃氏之另錯誤，為忽視國內各省之物價小衡關係。試就滬粤一曰地而言，廣州之　售物價指數二　　年為一〇四，上海為〇二。二十四年十一月（新貨幣政策實施之月廣州物價指數降至九二·三，而上海物價指數指數昇至九八·二七，三月又昇至九九·四一。縣是觀之，廣州物價指數，已漸與滬市平衡。一旦將粵幣再行抵押二五％，如黃氏所主張，則粵省物價廉可向他日傾銷，而失却國內經濟之均衡矣。黃氏中匯兌傾銷說之毒而不能自拔，有若此者。</p>
<p>（二）準備穩定說　此中國經濟學社廣州分社及其社長李宗泰初氏之意見也，此派着眼之點，為改制後之準備金及債券之妥實問題，較諸匯兌傾銷說又似落後。李氏等論調之人意謂：現粵省流通紙幣額為二四九，二一二，〇六二，五〇元，白銀則有一萬零七百四十五萬元（內大洋一九，五五〇，〇〇〇元，毫洋八三，九九〇，〇〇〇元），共實得純銀六千七百萬盎斯。此項白銀，如在紐約以每盎斯五角至六角之價格出售，可換取美金一千萬元，卽國幣一萬二千萬元。以此項白銀，再發行公債千萬元，卽可發行國幣劵萬萬元，適合銀柳債四之規定。以二萬萬元國幣加三計算（此係李氏之主張，）收回舊幣二萬萬五千萬元，為數相差無幾。李氏並指出，發行八千萬元公債事屬易舉，担保及承受方面均不成問題。然據吾人館之，則卽使按李氏之法，以加三比率計寡，現命準備仍不足四百萬元左右，須由當軸者設法張羅，此其一。發行公債，筆者內無對反理。然鄙見以為卽使担保與承受方面均布成問題，則付息還本方面，必須十分注意。公債而用於生產事業，還本付息之担負者，卽為該種企業。公債而用於整理金融，則負担者為人民，無異增重人民租稅。且今日政府旣發公債甚多，卽須　萬萬公債作抵押亦可獲得，毋庸再　，此其二也。以上係純就技術方面而言更從理論方面言之。吾國自去年事業月新債幣政策實施之後，實際上已採行管理通貨本位制度。發行鈔劵，並無須嚴格運從「通貨主義」之理論。所謂通貨主義者，認一社會之通貨流通額須加以限制，並主張嚴格的以一定準備金為基礎者也。一八四四年之英國PeelsAct之頒佈，實為此說勝利之先聲。厥後各國皆起而傚法，庸俗之貨幣學者奉為主皋。然貨幣學理論演進至今日，已否認此種理論為天經地義，管理通貨說已取其地位而代之矣。管理通貨之者，統制貨幣之數量及流通速度，使其與商業交易量維持平衡，因而穩定物價之謂也。今持國旣已行管理通貨制度，自母庸斷斷然講求準備之確實，僅須注意物價之穩定卽可。據廣東省調查統計局之估佔計，在過去六十年間，白銀流入粤省者約三萬萬元，廣東自實行收買白銀政策以來，僅收買小洋八千餘萬，大洋一千九百餘萬，尚有萬萬餘元，窖藏於民間。今吾政府仍度施白銀國有政策，如能收買一億八千萬元，則可繼續發行二億元鈔券。苟政府採行此種政策，則廣東紙幣驟增至另領％以上，是可慮耳。在他方面言乏，巷民間藏銀不易張羅，現存庫銀又為抵償　超而流出，從而影響於通貨之收縮，是又可慮者耳。意者發鈔準備，不過為一種心理上之因素，有如各銀行之WinowDrescing品作用，可臨時設法應付，母庸過度重視之。若仍一秉往昔之觀念，發鈔以準備多寡為基準，則行之不宣，反貽通貨　搖之禍，如上所述，此則非準備穩定者之初衷矣。</p>
<p>（三）抬高平價說　此為廣州市各行業公會所提倡，員說表面上雖主張半換，而老其　則以提高粤幣為目的。其理由略謂：「去年雖佈告加一收買白銀，其實全省商民無論存放欵項或交收欵項，均係照原有毫銀數目得回若干法幣。此種數量，較諸政府收售，何止超過數倍？可見般商民，並非各得有加二換取法幣之利益，今若以亳銀平換得來之法幣，須加高價始能換得人洋，豈非增重人民損失？」——八月—、日廣州民國日報所載市商會宣言。於此可將比率問題分為二談，其一為國幣與粤鈔之折合比率，共一為粤法幣與粤亳洋折合比率。本文所注重者原為粤幣折合國幣比率問題，蓋粤法幣與粤　洋應行平換，理由至顯，已見上述。至如有主張國幣與粤法幣及粤亳洋立不同比率者，（如李蔭南氏，見銀行週報二十卷二十期），則徒得其表，未知其實耳。然廣州市商會之說用以解釋粤法幣與粤毫洋應平換則可，用以作為粵法幣與國幣應行耳換則不可。何則？蓋粵幣與國幣之比價，就其常態而言，原盤旋于加二之間，而平換說則主張廢除此加二之數，是無異將粤幣提高二成也。其說之利弊，滴與滙兌傾銷說相反。粤民之名目所得雖因之而增加，國家稅收亦有利，然工商業必受幣値昂貴之害。更露骨言之，此種抬高幣値之論者，蓋未慮及粵省經濟之崩潰之危險也。</p>
<p>以上三說，均不免有所偏頗，而非從管理通貨穩定通貨方面着眼者。彼輩徒注重比率題，然此問題若一任個人主觀判斷，則不易定。如廣州中山大學經濟學主任黃元彬氏，亦一再變更其比牽主張；時而主張加四，時而主張力五。更有主張以粤省以前收買大洋銀乏比率加四·四為標準者，自詡以事實為根據，在事理上則殊屬毫無根據。李泰初氏之加三比率，雖與穩定貨幣論者之主張相近，然其出發點卽已錯誤。平換之說，亦具有相當理由，然將毫銀與粤鈔平換及夸鈔與國幣半換混為一談，良堪嘆惜！更有主張以昔日整理四出紙幣之法整理粤省幣制者，此亦為不明瞭粤省金融狀况所致。當時川省發行制度未趨統一，故中央政府將中央紙幣推行川省，使其自成比價，遂漸收回川省舊幣，免一一考慮各種雜鈔比價之煩。粤省情形則異乎是，保管準備委員會旣已成立，發鈔大權均在廣東省銀行之手，佔二四〇，七二二，〇六五·五〇元，市銀行僅佔八，五〇〇，〇〇〇元而已。據筆者管見，壓低粵幣或抬高粤幣，均非粤省人民之利，吾人應走之途徑，厥為穩定粵省貨幣，試述其說若次。</p>
<p>（四）穩定貨幣說　此說於財政部整理粵省幣制三原則中可得之，其言曰：（一）使最大多數人民不受整理時之損失，（二）不使稅收過分减少，（三）使粵幣融洽法幣準備金。次為粵省法幣發行準備保管專門委員會之意見書中所列舉四項：（一）安置白銀以堅民信仰；（二）（三）穩定大小比價，應從大多數人民經濟利益着想：（四）按社會需要伸縮鈔券。不佞為穩定貨幣之信徒，故亦贊同是說。鄙意以為大洋與小洋之比率，以穩定於加一·五為適宜。其理由的會下列諸端：</p>
<p>甲，適合商業習慣獎勵生產事業過去數年間粤省小洋與滬幣之比價，多盤旋於加二乏閒，夫滬幣實為國幣之代表也。今此加二·五之比率，旣可適台商業習慣，而較賭昔日常熊稍高，所以獎勵生產事業也。</p>
<p>乙，政府稅收不受影響二十年來，廣東省稅收與大洋折合比率，其先以加二，機而加二·五，加二計算。今日將比率定為二·五，無甚更改，政府稅收無莤損失，此其二。</p>
<p>丙，鈔券與準備金融洽就準備方面而言，準李泰初氏之說，參以加二·五之計算方法，無準備之發鈔額僅數百萬元而已。現存民間白銀尙有　萬萬元之鉅，籌足白銀準備殊匪難事。員滬上各發行銀行之發鈔白銀準備，恒在七〇％以上。，茍粤省　銀一時不易收買，暫由滬方接濟，亦易辦到。然吾人應注意者，白銀準備充其景祗有心理上之作用而已，雖不能完全忽視，亦母庸鰓鰓過慮。</p>
<p>丁，杜絕大洋與小洋間之投機大洋與小洋比率固定於加二·五後，與滬上及各地小洋兌價均甚接近，如是可杜絕小洋之投機活動。否則在新制推行伊始之際，舊輔幣仍可通行，其價格必將有異常之變動，是可預言者也。</p>
<p>戊，粤幣以加二·五之比率穩定之後，粤民內部經濟完全不受影響，如他日政府欲行一全國的貶値政策，亦不致惹起粵民之反感。</p>
<p>己，最後從手續方面而觀大洋小洋比率，决定於一〇二，五與一〇〇，亦頗脗合。</p>
<p>平價云者，兩種不同貨幣所含金屬之比率也。苟此次改革幣制，採行加二·五之比率，與平價甚為接近，則用出毫洋者絲毫無損失，故樂於使用大洋（卽將持有亳洋換成大洋票），其有助於大洋券之推行顯而易見。如比率定在加五加六之間，則持有亳洋者自不願以低價換成法幣，窖歲之風必起。</p>
<p>以上之分類，係筆者站在貨幣學上為研究之便利而劃分者。而最後之穩定貨幣說，能兼顧各方面，旣合於理論，又與實情脗合，故筆者認該說為較正確。然穩定貨幣論者，最注重物價之安定。在比率問題解决之後，自應致力於物價安定。上述之專門委員會，為廣州編製物價指數之機關，仍應繼續編製。如他日新制推行後物價有非常態之變動，或匯價亦有非常態之變　，可隨時伸縮發鈔額，使之獲得調整。因貨幣學在今日仍甚幼穉，僅能尊立一政策之原則，實施時之繁枝細節，仍須借助於統計數字也。　—八月十六日於香港—掉期交易多</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>現在的時代，正是一個歷史的交叉點，許多人徘捆在沒落的和前進的十字路口，一條是沈醉的，頽廢的，誘入墜入黑暗的深湖去，而那另一倏，却正是昭示人們前進，積極的鬥爭的光明大道</p>
<p>我們要從最艱苦的生活中，去找尋自己的前途，不要為了現實的苦痛，就沮喪了我們的志氣，渙散了我們的精神，跑到消極的，麻醉自己的路上去。</p>
<p>只有在集體的生活中，我們纔可克服許多的困難和障礙，把個人轉移到鬥爭的途上去，我們决不能害怕社會羣衆，使自己更陷入無聊的頹廢的，——永久　在個人生活的圈子裏。</p>
<p>我們要認淸世界，認淸民族，認淸社會，然後來决定我們當前應走的途徑！</p>
<h3>摺扇考始</h3>
<p>— 倪高風</p>
<p>崔豹古今注：「舜作五明扇」，此為扇之創始，但其形狀與製法，巳不可玫。漢以後通用團扇，以紈素為之，故又名紈扇。當時歌詠團扇之作頗多，最著者班婕妤怨歌行，有「新製齊紈素，團圓似明月」之句。江淹詩：有「紈扇如團月，出自機中素」之句，則其形狀與質料，與今之　勗同，而絕無言摺扇者。摺扇可名聚瑣扇，又名摺疊扇，始於何時，共說不一。按南齊書：「褚淵以腰扇障日。」胡三省注：「腰扇佩之於腰，今謂之摺疊扇。」此摺扇二字之最早見者。趙彥衛雲麓漫草「摺疊扇以蒸竹為骨，夾以綾羅，貴家或以象牙為首，飾以金銀，蓋出於高麗。」陸深春風堂隨筆：「南宋以來，詩詞詠聚瑣扇者頗多。東坡謂高麗白松扇，展之廣尺餘，合之止兩指許正今摺扇，蓋自北宋已有之。」又云：「倭人製為泥金面，烏竹骨充貢。」據趙，陸二氏之說，則宋代巳有摺扇，惟一言出高麗，一言倭人充貢，微有不同。然秋圍雜佩稱：「元時高麗以摺疊扇充貢，明永樂間，始盛行於中國，宣德弘治之際，李昭，馬動，皆以製扇著名。」天錄瞰餘亦云：「摺壘扇古名聚瑣扇，僕隸所執，取其便於袖藏，以避尊貴者之目。元時高麗始以充貢，明永樂間稍效為之，今則流行寖廣，團扇廢矣。」據此二說，則摺扇在元代始由高麗流入，與上二家之說互異。大抵宋時東夷高麗，問以摺扇入貢，在中國猶未盛行，至元代則彼二邦以之入貢者，始稍稍繁，於是國內流行　亦稍稍廣。至明代，則國人且自行仿製，此摺扇之略史也。有謂聚瑣扇與摺疊扇不同者，援鶉堂華記云：「摺疊扇亦是團扇，曲之可卷舒，與今日所謂聚瑣扇者異。」此蓋因南齊時尙無聚瑣扇，而胡三省著齊書，謂腰扇卽今之摺疊扇，故疑而謂摺疊扇與聚瑣扇不同耳。然團扇之可卷舒者，不惟今無其制，在載籍中亦未有玫，故終嫌其說之無徵。至於胡氏生於元代，其注通鑑，今謂之摺疊塌云云，是以今釋古，固自來訓詁家之通例。顏師古注漢書，如此類者甚多，正不必因此而拘泥也。</p>

<h3>半升堂</h3>
<p>— 光緝</p>
<p>半升堂，是我們那個鎭上的一個闊家的堂名。至於怎樣呌做半升堂的來由，那倒是很值得一說的。</p>
<p>這闊家的公公，是一個有名的富商，可是，傳到他的爸爸手裏，因為平臼嬌生慣養，一旦大權在握，便狂嫖闊賭，紙醉金迷，有限的金錢，究不能供無窮的揮霍，在短短的幾年中間，就弄得家產蕩然！到了「典質殆盡」，「饘粥不機」之後，他這位公公，就一病謝世了！遺下來的僅僅祗有還沒吃完的半升米，輪到闊家接手，雖然如此「家境蕭條」，但他並不灰心懶意，反而刻苦自厲，把米到街上去換了些糖果，拿到鄉下去兜售，再從鄉下販了些土貨，拿到街上去變賣，轉來轉去，轉點蠅頭之利。這樣，這了一兩年，也就積蓄了幾十百把塊錢，恰巧，這時候江災淹過，堤邊的隙地，讓人耕種，他就把錢儘量的買了殼種，散播在隙地裏，碰了這年豐收，於是，就穫了大量的稻子。後來還做些殼米生意，也是一帆風順，因此，就創了這許多產集，而恐怕後人祇知享福，不曉得先人創業的艱辛，所以把堂名取做半升堂，以資紀念，而示來茲。</p>
<p>我以為這是對的，因為他現在的子孫，將來都能够守成的。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　　喜字重來書題羣葉　嫁衣鸞乍試淚濕絞綃</p>
<p>所以他雖極力的鎮定着，照常的作事，可是身上軟綿綿的，就帶了什麽病似的，自己也不知道要怎樣的才能把身體安頓了。十分的無辦法中，只有睡在床上，比較的舒適些。因之晚上有兩晚沒看夜書，次日早上，也起來得很晚。這一日早上，劉媽在門外呌道：有一封掛號信，請先生起來蓋戳子罷。國器以為是上海書局裏，把稿費寄來了，趕快披衣下床。開門蓋戳將信接着，却是厚厚的一個大信封，寄信人地址，寫着是城北丹鳳街吳斯仁。自己何嘗有這麽一個朋友。及至把信拆開。却是張白宣紙，夾了一張八行在內。這倒是一椿奇怪的事，來不及去看那張八行，先把宣紙透開來看。原來是張綠色蘭花，顧的上欵是唳天先生粲存。下欵寫的是民國二年暮春，佩蘭室主謹繪。在這上面有一絕詩，乃是：幽谷誰會見，春來空自春，描成三五葉，寄與素心人。國器看過之後，好像買彩票的人中了頭彩，喜歡得要跳起來。脫口而出的自言自語道：他答應了。於是放下了畫，立刻把那張八行拿起來看。那上面稀稀的幾行書，格外的秀媚。那文字是：</p>
<p>唳天先生雅鑒：復接大札，不覺汗不涔涔。惶恐慚愧，蓋相交集。前以家範尊嚴相吿，語出至誠，瓜李之嫌，猶小言之。不期長夕短詠，雙管齊下，死灰橋木如蘭者受之，不僅啼笑皆非而巳。先生人物英俊，文彩藻麗，方將結交海內，名重士林，何必拳拳致意於不自長進之弱女子。備繪蘭葉一幅，藉補齊壁。非云投桃之報，聊別絕交之書。有此紀念，當巳不負垂靑。伏乞珍重前途，勿復以書見惠矣。知罪知罪。</p>
<p>偑蘭室主再拜</p>
<p>這眞出於意料，畫的這幅蘭花，不是訂交的，倒是絕交的。先生是將這封信，一口氣的看完了，這時把信看完，一研究信裏的意味。不願再有信去，那是眞的。但是自己寫去的信，他也並不認為是冒犯了他的。由各方面看來，他是一位極有新智識而又富於舊道德的女子，若是就原諒他一方面說：倒是不再寫價給他為得體了。自己拿了這封信，站在屋子中間，只管出神。劉媽送了茶水進房，他也不會看見，右手拿了那疊信紙，只是在左手心裏撫摩着。及至劉媽呌了他兩遍，他才醒悟過來了。他看到桌上放了一壺茶，就拿了杯子斟上一杯。端起杯子來，本待喝下去，轉覺得口裏有些枯燥，這還是沒有洗臉嗽口的緣故。於是去洗臉（六四）</p>

<h3>往「午夜觀日」之國　王景岐談中瑞挪關係</h3>
<p>— 無私</p>
<p>八月十八日下午五時，赤日當空，天　熱得發悶，上海新關碼頭上，擠滿了中外各色人士，輪渡上陳列着幾十隻鮮豔的花曁。新任駐瑞典挪威公使王景岐博士，穿了一身白嗶嘰西裝，鼻架眼鏡，先同碼頭上送行的人，一一握手行體。他跨登海關特放小輪「利平」號，汽笛一聲，在送行者揮精揚巾中，王公使立在船頭舉手行告別禮，搭德國郵　蘭新諾號，於十九日上午八時，放洋履新去了。</p>
<p>瑞典挪威赴北歐的兩個王國，地處斯干的那維亞半島，在北冰洋南，波羅的海北，因離中國路程迢遠，中國人士對於道兩國的風俗政情，比較隔膜，記者在渡輪上特舉以詢問，承王公使發表下列的書面談話：</p>
<p>典和挪威兩國，在從前，本來都是丹麥的屬國。十六世紀初，瑞典觀離丹麥獨立，奠定王國基礎。一八一四年，挪威和丹麥分離，也宣吿獨立，但是仍奉瑞典的君王為君王，是一種半獨立式的國家。直至一化〇五年，才宣布對瑞典脫離，完成獨立瑞挪兩國分治以來，才有三十年以上的歷史。</p>
<p>「瑞典是一個農業的國家，全國人口六百十九萬餘，大半都是田間農民。物產以鐵為較豐富，國內多森林，木材及紙業，也很發達，火柴貿易，為全世界冠，中瑞兩國通商，從一八四七年開始，輸入中國的舶來品，以紙料，銅鐵，火柴為大宗。中國運至瑞典商品，為桐油，疋頭，古玩。據民國二十四年海關統計，瑞典進口貨共値八百五十八萬七千二百八十四元。對瑞輸出貨値一千四百一十萬零九百五十四元。</p>
<p>挪威是一個新興的工業化國家。全國人口二百八十一萬人。氣候酷寒，可耕的田土，不過百分之四，可居住的，也只佔全面積百分之七五，物產以魚類為大宗，歐戰前農產及林業尙發達，戰後工商業大形衰頹。對中國輸人品，除紙類外，以魚肝油，餅乾，牛乳膏，罐頭，魚類。中國輸至挪威商品，為絲緒，繭衣，雜糧，桐油，茶油，鴨毛豬腸等，國一十四年海關報吿，挪威對華進口貨值四百八十五萬八千五百十八元。對挪威出口六十萬四千八百〇一元。</p>
<p>至於中國對於瑞挪兩國的國際關係，除了上述的通商貿易狀况以外，中瑞兩國在學術文化上也有合作的事業。近年中瑞科學家曾合組西北科學考察團，與瑞人斯文赫定博士合作，搜集關於地質學，氣象，天文，人類，考古，民俗各種資料標本甚多，對於科學定有听貢獻。挪威雖尙未有此種合作，但是挪威幾個著名文學家如史特林堡，易卜生，般生等的作品，都有了中文的譯本，對於中國新文化運動，曾發生過相當的影響」。</p>
<p>最後王公使對記者說：『我國人士因比較的不很明瞭瑞典挪威兩邦的情形，所以每次聽到北歐午夜觀日奇景，常引為海外奇談。這次本人到瑞挪兩國，只知秉承政府意旨，敦陸邦交，促進商務及文化事業。本人决不敢貪戀北歐佳麗的山川，只知服務國家，更願意將中國文化向北歐兩邦介紹，務使東西兩大民族間的情誼得互相增進，五相深切地了解』。</p>

<h3>兩個女人</h3>
<p>— （楊變理）</p>
<p>德國文豪巴爾札克在他的婚姻的生理一書上說：「男人心中常常有兩個女人：一個是他所要的，可是不能到手；別一個是他到了手，而不是他所要的。」換句話說，就是他所要的一日到了手也不是他所要的了，唉！那水如何有滿足的一天呢？這稱心理，可謂自私巳極？</p>
<h3>畫機與脚鐲</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>摩登女子，到了夏天，都流行着袒胸露臂，裸腿赤脚，充分地者現出肉來。可是伊們的腿，不是黃瘦不堪，便是疤斑累累。於是把從前擦在臂上的某一種粉，現在也居然加在腿上來了。</p>
<p>在今年，伊們又增了兩件新頴的妝飾品，—畫襪和脚鐲。所謂畫機，就是畫於腿上的假襪，其腿固完全赤裸者，所以與肉色絲襪般。這種假襪的畫法十分精巧，它的絲紋纖毫畢肖，眞僞莫辨，祇可惜不能洗滌。因為一經着水，那鉛華就此去，回復本來面目。</p>
<p>女子的裸腿赤足，已流行了好多年了。這在襪廠，果然有失利權。但是商人畢竟是有智謀的，除了供給蔻丹之類來裝點伊們的足趾外，今年又發明了一種金色的脚鐲來做伊他們小腿的妝飾品，面脚鐲上，還置着幾個小鈴，走起路來丁令丁令會響的</p>
<h3>意識顚倒</h3>
<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>某君纔從大學畢業，緊接着要出國留學，便在登輪的前夜，一個公餞的筵席上，提出一本美麗小冊子，請求在座諸君各寫一些臨別贈言。</p>
<p>小冊子輾轉遞到一位「盛氣年少」的朋友手中，他正要舉筆留題，忽然一眼見了那册上所有許多字句之問的一橫行，不禁衝口喊道：「咦！豈有此理？為什麽要駡人家「倦不學好」呢？」</p>
<p>但在須臾之間，他也和在衆人的鬨笑中笑了，因為他自己也立刻覺悟到，他竟被「中文西寫」的習慣搆成誤會。那原是十分美意的一個成語：「好學不倦」哪！</p>
<h3>三種人吃　的瓜皮</h3>

<h3>如何解决十分執拗之淋病</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國大學醫科陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>患淋病而久不得愈者　依此療法，卽得澈底解决</p>
<p>淋毒是一種最難肅淸之花柳病，牠的執拗性，遠勝於梅毒下疳等，譬如梅毒有六〇六的特效藥可以注射，下疳好了之後就不再發，獨是這淋毒，到時慢性時，往往表面上似乎並無十分可怕症狀，但一遇到有刺戟的塲所，這狡猾的淋菌，就竊發了。這種情形，在淋病中的副尿道炎，攝護腺炎等，最為常見，你看看排出來的小便，幾乎是很淸的。因此病人就不十分注意牠，所以飲酒房事，勞動等，都恣意妄為，這實是刺戟淋菌竊發的絕好機會，如此往復的再發，往往變成心臟內膜炎，敗血性等致命的危險。</p>
<p>此等執拗性的淋病，一般不知者，以為服了透膜殺菌藥就可治好了。其實病理並不這樣簡單，我們不須用面面顧到的療法，其次一位徐姓病家，他患病已經是六七年了。他本來是患攝護腺炎，因屢次復發，每發輒用透膜殺菌的藥去敷衍了事，不想症狀愈演愈凶，已由攝護腺變成全身傳染的關節炎了。再不敢用這等藥來遺害自己乞余醫治，經用嚴密檢査之下，覺非用抗淋殺菌的藥劑不可，遂囑其向各藥房購服「克淋儂」連服五星期，即吿根治，其夫人的白帶也由我指示內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除淋帶。同居迄今不但未發，且得一子。「克淋儂」之有此功效者，以其有使體內起抗淋殺菌作用。且此作用直接在病灶上發生，不損健全組織，此為任何抗淋殺菌藥所不及之特點。購服者必須認淸。</p>
<h3>婦女的白帶病妨害生育</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>女子如有白帶，不僅不能表現健美之典型，實亦百病叢生之根苗，故吾人必須殲除之。考此病之成因，有從內發者，有從外來者，何謂從內發生，即許多身體發育不全，月經紊亂，先由子宮病及子宮附近器官病而來者，皆可歸於此類，凡丈夫素患淋病，以致細菌乘房事之際，得沾染之。於是遂亦成為淋毒性白帶。更因自凟關係，將粘膜擦破，使細菌得以乘之，而發生種種危險。此亦吾人於臨床上，屢見不鮮之事也。</p>
<p>患者不分晝夜，黃白色之惡液，涓涓從陰道中流出，致局部益因浸潤而糜爛，甚至化膿成潰，將整個生殖機能毀滅，此尤為可畏之後果也。他如月經本甚調整者，亦因白帶病而紊亂，復因月經紊亂而不能受孕。關於此症之適當而有效之處置，余指示病家向各藥房購用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，恒可在短期間，獲得滌除之效。此種療法甚為簡便，凡患此病者，可將此片在家自己秘密應用，毫無副作用。（每次於臨睡前用一片放入陰道為坐藥次晨洗去即得。）惟如身體虛弱而來者，除用此片外，須內服「補女容」，以調經補血，而促白帶之治愈。若係淋毒性白帶，則又非兼服「克淋儂」不可。因「克淋儂」有在體內發生抗殺淋菌之功。可助「卡氏陰道片」發揮滅菌之效力。故能縮短治療時期，且又可免再發也。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖楊道南醫師生殖系疾患講座</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角。　診時：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>靑年人之危險期　可怕的自凟</p>
<p>自凟是靑年人之最普遍之惡習，患者一旦犯此，即難戒絕，於是身體各部之發育，遂猝遭打擊，夫以正在發育之靑年，何堪旦旦摧殘，宜乎百病之叢集矣。故凡已發育者，因機能不健全而退化。未發育者，更無繼續發育之可能，下部矮小如兒童，即僥倖而稍獲發育，亦是畸形的，結果等於不能發育，由此更繼不能發育而來之症狀，有遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅，精神散慢，興趣索然，記憶力異常薄弱，以致讀書愚拙，考試皆在落後，故益增苦悶，他如耳鳴眼花，頭痛失眠，時求性的刺戟，致神經益陷衰弱，所有症狀，益形深化，人生希望，盡歸消滅。</p>
<p>關於此症之療法，據吾等之治療，以荷爾製劑中之男用「補體康」一藥，為最有效之處置。同時輔以電氣療法，如遺精者，又輔以「耐而斯遺精片」，以處置遺精。按「補體康」係為德人倫氏所發明。其原料係採取勇壯動物之荷爾蒙所製成，凡患手淫惡癖而來之發育不全及遺精病等，服後均可於數星期中充分發行其靑春腺，使性機能有充分之發育，同時由手淫而來之一切症狀，均可治愈。此為吾等年來共同實騐之事。服「補體康」而愈者，為數已不知凡幾矣，此藥久已風行歐美諸國，我國各大藥房，均有「補體康」經售。</p>
<h3>淋病療法之比觀</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動醫科大學醫學博士楊道南醫師</p>
<p>殺菌動輒全身帶危險！　除了昂進自然療能，　還有何種捷徑可循？</p>
<p>淋病之治療，過急則傷害健康，過緩則無當于事。行局部之透膜殺菌，則藥力未達，而淋菌已繁殖蔓衍及於後尿道與全身，一杯之水，焉能挽救車薪？若一味以霸藥撲滅全身淋菌，則未受其益，先蒙其害矣；由是各種變症，紛至沓來：如關節炎之使人　廢，心內膜炎之致人暴死，皆其顯例。</p>
<p>然則淋病治療將以何法為最可靠？有之：則惟以喚起人身固有之「自然療能」為最！能昂進「自然療能」者，獨淋病聖藥「克淋儂」始克副之。何以言之；蓋人體本來即有一種抗菌力，此種抗菌力，存在於每一細胞與血球之機能上。是即所謂「自然療能」。吾人倘被淋菌沾染，則細胞與血球均起抗毒作用。淋菌若繁殖日速，抗毒力即日漸衰减，終至淋病由急化慢，以至蠢起各病。此時若再不服「克淋儂」即進細胞與血球之「自然療能」，則病勢將岌岌可危矣。</p>
<p>夫「克淋儂」之配製，乃德國權威淋病學家彼得Bledel博士，根據其學理上所創獲，及臨床實騐結果，採取蛋白體類脂汁並侶合純凈無疵之色素所製成。其對於男女一切急慢性淋病或白帶，男子慢性之攝護·睪丸·關節炎等，最有特效！余在國內外，迭經治癒多人。惟於婦女患淋毒性白帶，則除用此藥內服外，並用外治「卡而雪地片」為坐藥，因藥性皆王道，不僅毫無流弊，且能於四五星期至七八星期左右，全部根治不發云。</p>
<h3>久咳治癒一例</h3>
<p>— 滬南平民醫院院長鄭源和醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽之延久不愈者，要皆為慢性氣管炎。慢性氣管炎之形成，則多由傷風忽視所致。秋凉矣！傷風咳嗽，與日俱來，居民烏可不愼！有患者姜少白君，年廿二，于本年初夏，納凉夜深，致染咳嗽。咳嗆頓頻，咯痰不爽，喉間乾燥，往往夜間咳嗽甚劇，不能平臥。痰質稠厚而多。遍服各藥，均未見效。延久不愈，身體衰弱，蓋已寖成久咳內傷也。經其由余診愈肺病之友人陶夢龍君介紹，來余處求治，余斷為慢性氣管炎，非普通製劑所能愈，乃囑服「補肺拿爾」以治久咳，而防癆傷，同時令服「補體康」以補衰弱，服四星期，痰淸咳止，精神大增，容光煥發，即吿痊治。余按「補肺拿爾」又能療小兒百日咳，老年哮喘等呼吸器痰咳之疾，尤其對於除痰，雅有特效！</p>
<h3>肺病筆談</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學敎授鄭源和醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時　說明：肺病有無特效藥？</p>
<p>余對於硏究肺病，已成為一種癖好。此無他，良以余在醫校時之所肄習，獨喜專志于心肺科。行醫時，所接觸患者，又大都為肺癆病人。抑且余在醫科大學執敎鞭時，所講授者又為心肺病學數事。各級同學，以余寢饋於斯道，輒喜以肺病有無特效藥一語相訽。夫肺病果無特效藥乎？何療肺之藥，層出不窮？若謂其早已有之，則肺病緣何治療如此其不易？余固夙亦以此為難題，而倉卒不能置答也。乃臨床上，肺病人亦復以此語相詰，余深苦之。凡身為肺病醫師者，必均有過此種受窘之經騐。</p>
<p>今日者，科學盛昌，醫學之進步尤速，往昔肺病之治療，於茲大事改進。如肺病外科之人工氣胸術，胸廓形成術等。內科之增補肺中結締織，減除酸素之藥物治療等皆是。除外科有其一定之適應症外，此種最新發明之藥物療法，余最為賞用。其藥名卽「補肺拿爾」，為徒梅博士所發明。余用此藥治肺癆咳嗽，咯出球形痰，胸部隱痛，食減，咯血，身體困瘦等，均奏良效，至于肺病兼有腦弱失眠，心悸等症，除服「補肺拿爾」外，宜兼服男用「補體康」（此藥兼治陰萎·腰疼·早洩·如有遺精可服「遺精片」）以治之。婦女則須服女用「補女容」（此藥兼能調經治帶，並治胎前產後各病）以治之，則轉弱為强，精神煥發，體重日增，癆患澈底淸除！以上各藥永安，先施，新新三公司西藥部及各大藥房有售。</p>
<h3>手淫所致之惡果——遺精</h3>
<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路通和銀行對過</p>
<p>挽救遺精首先要注意的兩個根本方法</p>
<p>手淫為靑年之大病，男子十人中，幾無一能守身如玉者，夫手淫乃機械的刺激神經，故神經首先即蒙其害，而陷入衰弱狀態中。一方則或為腦神經衰弱，而有神思恍惚，精神萎靡等現象。情緒紊亂，易於悲傷怨憤，無端自苦，常興自殺之念。其思想亦不能集中，判斷力與記憶力均形减弱，自信力亦失，於是作事無恒心，終日昏懵，頭痛耳鳴，失眠心悸，莫不循虛而至。</p>
<p>另一方面，則成為性神經衰弱，夢遺，滑精，用力或大小便後，則精液捐漏。因此生殖機能萎弱不堪，而構成早洩，陰萎，腰痛，勃起無力，甚至發育不全等。依據在國外硏究所得，以及各國著名醫師之實騐報吿，均以絕對進服德國「耐而斯」「遺精片」為主，而以內分秘製劑「補體康」為之輔導。「耐而斯遺精片」為專遺精之聖藥不論每日遺精或一日遺精數次等，服後立可收效。又能增强意志，减除神經之刺激，故犯有手淫惡癖者，雖積習難除，而服「耐而斯遺精片」後，即自然戒止。「補體康」為挽救遺精病人，前述衰弱各症特效劑，以此二藥同時進服，約三四星期可全愈。倘能連服二月，雖任何劇烈腎虧，及發育不全，均能獲最美滿之效。「遺精片」永安及中西大藥房有售。</p>
<h3>治淋小統計</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學士武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>（以上均係服「克服儂」半打至一打左右而痊愈者，並經騐血證明斷根。）</p>
<h3>二個急性淋　短期治愈</h3>
<p>— 南通醫大武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>“失戀後之痛苦”小便艱窘</p>
<p>患者何忠海君，年廿三歲，因初戀失敗，憤而投足花叢，每日躑躅靑樓，不知自返。詎未三星期，尿道卽灼熱，膿血粘液擁於尿道，致小便艱窘異常，龜頭紅腫，包皮翻轉，痛楚不堪，日夜呼號，何君因失戀之後，精神本極沈鬰苦悶，更遭此意外之淋病，頓萌厭世之念，幸山知友周君勸慰，並介紹其至余處治療，余為之行消毒洗滌法後，即投服「克淋儂」，以抗淋殺菌，鎮痛退腫，僅三星期，即將全部淋菌肅淸，一切痛苦皆於無形中除去。</p>
<p>淋病中之遺精</p>
<p>患者劉大岳君，年念五歲，於宿娼後之第三日，即患淋病，兼有遺精之苦，淋系如絮，尿道刺痛有如針攢，少腹亦疝痛，先服透膜殺菌等藥而無效，局部之痛苦旣能影響全身，而又因每夜的遺精，故有失眠頭痛，精神極度煩躁不安。改來余處醫治，乃急性精囊炎也。即以「克淋儂」以撲減病灶上之淋菌，而促炎症之消失。並以「耐而斯遺精片」治其遺精，先後治療計三星期零四日，所患全治，並用血淸檢查，亦無淋毒反應。於是劉君之淋病，始得到根治之證明。而遺精亦獲全瘳。身體壯碩異常。</p>
<h3>癡肥變俏瘦甲狀腺萎縮之救療</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>前余與同事江少椿君，因事赴南洋，仰光等處考察，見一年約四十左右之婦人留住於當地醫院治療，此婦人症象頗為特異，營養不良其皮膚有如獸皮，呈浮腫，癡肥狀，面貌呆笨而毫無活潑，體重增多（如甲圖），感覺遲鈍，記憶力減退，行動不靈，脈搏徐緩，血管運動性亦有變化，血壓約在一二五耗水銀柱，體溫下降，月經困難，經診察結果，該婦人實為甲狀腺萎縮，甲狀腺之機能減退，致成粘液水種Myxoedem遂行內分泌療治，投以梅倫氏所發明之女用荷爾蒙製劑「補女容」，連服至六星期之後，甲狀腺機能亢進，形體漸見消瘦活潑，肌肉充實營養佳良，恢復原來俏麗面目（如乙圖），月經調整，再調養三星期始行出院。初該婦由醫院中金醫師治療時，余適又往他處考察，比返時距該病婦出院僅二天也。蒙金醫師將此病之經過如此。亦見「補女容」功效之卓特矣。此藥不僅治甲狀腺病，凡發育不全，臀部瘦削，乳房癟小，月經不調，久婚失孕，及失眠神經衰弱，白帶下等，悉有特效。且可自己購服，毫無流弊。國內外各大藥房均有此藥出售。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>白崇禧</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>現在政府擺在實前而應怠速解决的，是兩佃問題，一個是對外的華北問題一個是對內的西南問題，這兩個問題，似乎沒有什聲連帶的關係，但是設法解抉這爾個問題，共關保殊為密切，所謂絧山西窮，洛鐘東應，便是此意。</p>
<p>華北方面，日駐屯軍前日召開慕傪會後，冀察綏晋魯各武官，均前往參加，對於華北各問題，有所協議，一方面團於中日調整交涉，俟川越到京，卽行關始，而交涉的方針，仍根攘廣田三原則為張本，所謂幕僚會議，所謂調整交涉，共內幕一時雖未能明瞭，而關於華北之嚴重性，固已不問可知。</p>
<p>西南方面，自陳濟棠下野以後，粵省方面，早已不成問題，而連日得到廣西方面消息，則李白欲負　自固，不肯接受中央命令，眞是令人浩歎，李白當北伐時，其功原屬不細，卽近日對於治桂方針，亦頗著相當之成績，倘李白能一旦幡然覺悟，以其治桂的精神，移而治浙，以其對內之手段，轉而對外，則李白今後之功勞，决不在北伐功勞之下，今乃執迷不悟，作困獸之鬥，我不知其是何居心。</p>
<p>中央之對於李白，所以一時未肯用激烈手段對付者，其原因卽在於此，所以不惜委曲求全，從長商討，希望李白能顧全大局，俾桂事得和平解抉，中央能容忍桂省之程度，其寬大亦祇於如此，今李白崛强多時，未肯轉意，去電忠告，亦置岡聞，近且有組織政府，分佈戰略之惡耗，禍機一發，玉石俱焚，李白雖不為身家性命計，獨不為廣西全省一般人民計乎，此種態度，實所未解。</p>
<p>李白對於北伐一役，與理治廣西之功，雖不可沒，而此次違抗中央命令，不肯就軾北來，共罪可得而數者，李白亦抉無可辭，一破壤國家統一之罪，二破壞國內和平之罪，三破壞民族精神團結之罪，四破壞外交陣綫，發生阻碍之罪，李白縱不為桂省一省計，獨不為中華民族存亡計乎。</p>
<p>而李白曰，我一切多不暇計，我情願做七匪，情願投共黨，任何犧性，在所不計，任何破壞，多不屑顧，是非愚則在也，不願為中華民國之功人，而甘為中華民國之罪人，其故究安在耶，我不禁為李白惜，而更為我國悲。</p>
<h3>豆腐阿文</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>竹筐裏的豆腐渣，壓在木架上，滴着奶水似的豆漿。</p>
<p>屋裏通黑，蒸發着豆汁的酸臭味磨盤底下還滴答滴答的流白漿糊，水桶快滿了。</p>
<p>一隻大耗子像兒的毛驢喘噓着，在濕地上拖了磨轉圈子，磚池子左邊，靠山灶的碗架裏，點着小美孚燈，晃晃地小燈苗兒，跟灶筒裏的烟混合着，顯得屋子烏沉沉的像條煤洞。</p>
<p>「晤——吁」阿文嫂弓着腰在灶頭上煮飯，驢子停住拉糞，她轉過身來叱喊。</p>
<p>窗外的天快黑了，冷風還不住氣兒的刮的樹葉在打着滾的笑華華地。</p>
<p>阿文擔着豆腐挑子，空空兒地從大街上走進胡回來。</p>
<p>「豆腐完了吧」？燒餅舖的王胖子笑的睞縫着眼和阿文打招呼。</p>
<p>「完啦，王掌櫃吃了飯沒有」？</p>
<p>「吃過了，阿文哥整天也怪辛苦呢」</p>
<p>「唉，過窮日子不吃苦怎麽着」，阿文說了慢慢走出巷子去。</p>
<p>「阿交這個相兒怎麽娶那麽個俏老婆」？林二提着空洋磁盆子在理髮館門口站着。</p>
<p>外號壞雜碎的縫鞋匠，抬起腦瓜來笑：</p>
<p>「賴漢娶花技麽，——嘿林二你可知道阿文的老婆有人想上啦」。</p>
<p>「白想，摸不着，頂屁的事」荷　，林二拉開風門子走了進去。</p>
<p>王掌櫃的摸着腮上的肥肉，裂的嘴像棉花桃兒：「人家是正經娘們，胡扯個什麽勁兒」！</p>
<p>「不信，這官的表弟胡印生哪天早上不喝豆漿去？」</p>
<p>「人家是作買賣！」</p>
<p>「賣肉窩窩不是買賣」？</p>
<p>「狗嘴里吐不出象牙來」！</p>
<p>凉颼颼的夜里、三更天的梆子在胡同日囊裏的敲，高大的白楊樹，滑沙滑</p>
<p>飛着枯葉子，風聲里吹來的大呌有點凄凉。</p>
<p>阿文兩口子睡得正香甜，小毛驉在棚子里吃草，屋　關得緊緊的。</p>
<p>「彭……彭彭……」</p>
<p>「阿文嫂先嚇醒了，心里突突的跳</p>
<p>「醒醒，你聽，有人打門呢」。</p>
<p>阿文揉着眼一翻身把棉袍披上，氣虎虎的問：</p>
<p>「誰，半夜三更的」！</p>
<p>「我我，聽出來了吧，我是胡先生，公安局的……」</p>
<p>門開了，一陣冷風爬過阿文脊梁上，他心里覺着古怪，胡老爺一晃身子撞了進來，屁股倒項着門板，拳頭像錘子似的提着：</p>
<p>「阿文，不準喊，我跟你商量件事」</p>
<p>阿文胸脯上像打皮球，腦瓜門發起燒來，看看胡老爺手里的小洋槍只</p>
<p>「胡老爺我們苦人沒有錢……」</p>
<p>「放屁，我能要你的錢，你出去，找個地方去睡覺」，</p>
<p>胡老爺瞪着牛蛋眼珠，抽了口氣，從口袋里掏出塊錢來「拿了去，天亮再回來。不比賣豆腐好？</p>
<p>阿文胸脯只向外漲，像小石頭似的股悶氣直攻心窩子，眼立楞着，黑臉垂了下來，左胳膊往上一擋，小洋槍飛到豆腐桶旁邊。</p>
<p>「放你媽的屁，滾」阿文彭的聲把門閂上。</p>
<p>胡老爺揉着腰，打房產底下爬起來，摸着被踢了一脚的傷處，痛得一按一蹶的走回家去。</p>
<p>太陽在東山冐嘴的當兒，灰白的天上飛着小黑老鴉，風兒冷淸淸的，野狗跑出胡同去，燒餅舖里噴着烟，公鷄早呌過三遍了。</p>
<p>幾個凍得怪精神的警察，顚顚的跑着，阿文夾在他們羣里，倒剪着胳膊綁得挺緊。</p>
<p>「我犯了什麽法啦？老總們」！</p>
<p>「少噜囌！」</p>
<p>「還裝沒事人啦」！</p>
<p>「膽小麽就安分點，私藏軍火」！</p>
<p>阿文呆呆的低着頭，讓他們架着擁出胡同去，油鹽店的夥訐抹着眼屎在下木門板，斜抑起頭來看了一陣說：</p>
<p>「賣豆腐的阿文吃官司啦！」</p>
<p>一個挑菜擔子的走過去應着：</p>
<p>「聽說是漢奸呢，有槍，勾結××人，不知是眞假」？</p>
<h3>筏房</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>夏夜，明月斜掛天空，河港裏恬靜着。水聲有規則地流潺。塘堤上的人跡，在那時比較稀疏下去。蚊蟲呢，却變得張狂了，烏合在叢草裏，不斷地攪擾着，破壞着沉靜的空氣。</p>
<p>水面是安寗呢。左岸排列着一　木筏。像條長蛇一樣懶在那裏。守望人的筏房，就像龍子似的搭捆在木筏上，也蹲伏着，伴隨着悄靜的夜。</p>
<p>那些樹木，水草……給月光反照在碧淸的水波裏捲曲地蕩漾……</p>
<p>分辯不出是那一所筏房裏發出來這樣動人的歌聲：——</p>
<p>「……二更裏，月正東，</p>
<p>月兒彎彎像把弓，</p>
<p>照在窮郎的筏房中。</p>
<p>窮郎命運苦！</p>
<p>窮郎的命運鎖在牢龍中。</p>
<p>為了三餐飯，替人作工。</p>
<p>終年流着汗和血，</p>
<p>生活一點不能鬆……</p>
<p>幾時我們才可脫樊籠，脫樊籠！……」</p>
<p>那個唱歌的筏夫，拉長了嗓子在白夜的河港裏豪放：似乎有意借着明月的光輝，在吁嘆自己的命運。</p>
<p>歌聲一會兒靜下去，空氣又沉寂着。連那些爬蟲們的噪呌，也像乎低沉呢。河心，仍舊散放着透明的白霧……</p>
<p>「孫林！……奶奶的，猴頭！學什麽娘們調兒，……簡直是……像鬼哭！……哈哈……簡直是……」那另一隻沙爽的喉口從一座鐵皮蓋頂的筏房裏滾出來，在河港上尖銳地震盪着……</p>
<p>被稱做猴頭的筏夫孫林，坐靠在小窗口，呆望着天空，對於那個醉鬼兒的粗暴的巨聲，彷彿沒有聽見。</p>
<p>天空依然流着白得發亮的浮雲，跟遠處的塘堤，叢林聯接成一片，像一伸手就捉摸得着似的。</p>
<p>筏房裏，充溢着黃酒的味兒，中年筏夫呵庚，獨自翻着唇皮在呑嚥。這回，他帶着七分醉意，走近孫林身邊，就在他肩頭沉重地拍一下：</p>
<p>「幹什麽悲傷？……眞像猴頭會做作呢！……好了！我們落得放放懷啦！一天的工作，奶奶的！……比如牛馬一樣……你瞧，咱到了夜晚，就歡喜這杯中的一點玩意兒……來！你我同飲一杯。……」</p>
<p>他隨手捉住孫林的胳膊，很命的牽纏着。那股難受的酒腥味，激厲地從闊大的那張嘴巴裏冲出来。</p>
<p>「老庚！讓你一人享樂吧！貪嘴的傢伙……別扭……」</p>
<p>孫林怒着臉。憎恨地對他貶了一眼，掙脫了老庚的抓擇，把眼珠沉下去，望着河水裏幌動的影子，看牠起着無角度的捲曲，濺散……</p>
<p>「猴頭！……」</p>
<p>阿庚把眼皮翻了一下，重重地咒罵了：接着，搶步上來，準備很很地責備他一價：</p>
<p>「嗨！小子！別裝作了啦，我們……要說命運，……我們常筏夫的命運，……生來就這輩子苦。……那一個是幸運？……」</p>
<p>孫林有點苦悶。他抑氣着想不到用什麽話來辯證，他望着水影，又轉眼看着天空，終於還把臉子沉下去……</p>
<p>這一下——阿庚咕魯完了，似乎酒意也淸醒了些，腦筋跟平時一樣底復了原狀，同情着，和孫林一起望着天空，紅腫的眼皮緊閉呢。</p>
<p>「呃！我們撑筏人出賣勞力，說什麽幸運！……我的老同伴！……」</p>
<p>再沒有接上來的聲音，筏房裏一片沉靜。</p>
<p>夏夜，明月憑空掛着，浮雲在天上推動着，河港裏依然沒靜着……</p>

<p>開篇「掃秦」</p>
<p>休笑俺瘋痴垢面形。地藏王有意落凡塵。借身打坐靈隱寺。壁上題詩為掃泰。拈香來了當朝相。三炷淸香手內擎。低頭默默暗通神。但願風調和雨順。惟求夫婦得長春。保佑岳家賢父子。往昇仙界早超生。抬頭猛見留詩句。奸雄戰檁頓然驚。此詩乃與夫人作。畫發春窗烈火焚。立時怒問喚瘋儈。那曉他，口吐禪機多變化。呼風喚雨盡皆能。手執火筒通外國。還拿棕帚掃好臣。風波只為專權起。含冤屈死冷泉亭。歸家夫婦同商議。削髮皈依却利名。聽信了讒言長舌婦。受盡了酆都地獄刑。到如今，渾身鐵籌岳王墳。</p>

<p>話。想必是，半為慚羞半為痴。今朝休被東風落。何事東風頻鞭笞。梨花呀，鳥因惜羽迎風啄。你因甚，瓣被風吹映墨池。雁足難逢書莫寄。墨池辦影慰想思。梨花呀，憔悴容顏誰見惜。惟儂惜愛情於斯。掃瓣拾納琴囊裏。憐我寸心莫嫌遝。哭花至此淚有未。花豈有情果知之。沒奈何，閉窗靜聽風竹掃蘭榫。</p>

<h3>「海棠紅」和「女權」</h3>
<p>製作了「刦後桃花」之後的張石川，接七復製作了兩部新片，一部是「海棠紅」，一部是「女權」。</p>
<p>張石川的作品，很少細膩和碎瑣的描寫，他是每每緊捉着劇的核心大刀闊斧地完成他的作品，故事敘述的簡潔淸楚，劇的高潮每每非常顯明的提示，有時也適宜地加進一些笑料，這便是他的作品之優越處。</p>
<p>「海棠紅」的演出是傴盡了悲歡離合，甜酸苦辣，故事中有着非常複雜的一羣人物；懦弱的女伶，殘酷的換子，淫糜的軍閥和他的善於逢迎，善於播弄的爪牙人物，善良而無用的商人，傷心的老人，紳士的一家人們，尋找着母親的孩子，忠厚的老僕，……有眼淚，有笑容，有憤怒，有瘋在，有嘆息，有嘲笑，有呼呌！</p>
<p>「女權」着重描寫着一個女子的故事，一個智識女性從少奶奶的脂粉氣息的生涯圈裏跳躍了出來，她閒始用她的學力向社會的圖地去掘墾，可是，「愛情」這一種東西處不放鬆的尙她圍攻着，所關「女子地位」僅僅不過是用作為花瓶的社會中問，她開始苦痛的到處彷徨，從江南到北國，她一寸也不能走進社會，全劇結束時，她還是為「愛情」而向漫漫的原野逃亡。</p>
<p>前後兩個劇本張石川都一一製作了，這兩部顯然在意義上有着很遠的分野的劇本，却同樣適宜於張石川的處理，你曾這樣覺得否？他是極善於處理一些複雜錯綜的故事，大塲面的牊寫的，那兩部就都是近於這一類的電影。</p>

The puppet army is conscripting carts from various counties, forcibly ordering each county to provide 500 laborers, and ordering residents to live together, emptying residential houses to prepare for the stationing of troops.

The more than 2,000 puppet troops of Yu Zhiqian's unit, originally stationed in the Industrial School outside the North Gate of Zhangjiakou, were ordered by the puppet government last week to go to eastern Suiyuan.

<h3>Sun Ke Returns to Nanking Talks; Central Government Prepares General Amnesty for Political Prisoners; Guangxi Affairs Hopeful for Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>Nanking - Sun Ke arrived in Nanking at 11:30 AM on the 23rd from Xunzhou aboard the "Gonghe" wheel steamer. Liang Hancao, Zhang Zhi, Wang Kunlun, Wang Zengshan, Ma Chaojun, Chen Jianru, Lu Zhaoqiang, Ma Honghuan, Ling Bing, and others were all at the pier to welcome him. After shaking hands with the welcoming party to express his thanks, Sun immediately returned to his private residence in the mausoleum to rest. Liang Hancao and Ma Chaojun followed Sun to his residence to report on matters. According to Sun's words to reporters, he stayed in Lushan for nearly a month this time. Now that the court's summer vacation recess is over, it is scheduled to resume on the 28th, so he returned to Nanking to handle court affairs. Regarding the Guangxi affairs, apart from receiving telegrams from Li and Bai last month, he is not yet aware of the recent situation in detail, but he firmly believes that the central government will be most generous and tolerant towards the Guangxi affairs. Only if Li and Bai can take a slightly broader and more farsighted view and not focus on regional concepts, a peaceful resolution can ultimately be hoped for. Later, when discussing the issue of a general amnesty for political prisoners, Sun said that Mr. Feng Huanzhang had made this suggestion, and President Jiang also mentioned it during the swearing-in ceremony of party, government, and military personnel in Guangdong. The central government still adheres to the principle of generosity and will grant a general amnesty to political prisoners who have contributed to the revolution, giving them a path to self-renewal, which can reduce the collective strength of reactionaries. Finally, when reporters asked for his opinion on reforming the Guangdong currency system, Sun said that the financial authorities' adoption of a gradual approach to reforming the Guangdong currency system is indeed a good strategy. However, studying the temporary measures announced, the value of silver fractional currency still cannot be determined. He is deeply concerned that speculators will manipulate the calculation and discount of silver fractional currency and legal tender, causing the people of Guangdong to suffer great losses between one discount and one integration. He still hopes that the financial authorities will find a way to provide relief. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The senior cadre meeting on the 24th is for the final exchange of opinions, and its nature is no longer serious. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

Zhang Zizhong is scheduled to host a banquet for Kawagoe at the Municipal Government on the 24th, and invite Chen Juesheng, Cheng Xixian, and many other prominent figures in the opposition as companions. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese government and opposition figures have high hopes for the national adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. It is generally believed that after Ambassador Kawagoe returns from the South, he will go to Nanking in mid-September to conduct formal conciliation with President Jiang and Minister Zhang. The long-standing cloudy and depressing situation of Sino-Japanese diplomacy will be able to unfold at that time. However, according to the observations of a certain country's diplomat, the future is not to be overestimated, because since Hachiro Arita took office, he has not had a fixed policy towards China, and still takes the will of the military department as the center, carrying out the so-called proactive and autonomous imperial diplomacy. Although he does not adhere to the three principles of Hirota on the surface, it is heard that what Kawagoe will negotiate with Nanking at that time will abandon abstraction and focus on practicality, which is even more excessive than the three principles of Hirota. As for the objectives of the negotiation, comprehensively observing Japan's recent movements towards China, it is nothing more than taking North China as the target principle for the ideal region of Japan. The following three points are emphasized: 1. Clarifying the politics of North China, the hopes for the Jicha government; 2. Reduction of customs duties; 3. Concrete measures for economic cooperation. All of these are the reefs that make it difficult to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and it is feared that they may not be as Japan wishes. Therefore, all parties here are paying attention to the development of the Nanking meeting in mid-next month and its results. (23rd Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - The second day of the Japanese Consul General meeting in Tianjin, formerly on the 23rd at 10:00 am, was held at the Consul General's residence, with Ambassador Kawagoe at the center, deliberating on countermeasures to deal with the situation in North China. After the meetings of army and naval officers and consuls general, the central and local opinions on Japan's policy towards China, especially the work in North China, have been completely consistent, and the authorities of the three relevant provinces have also reached a complete understanding. Therefore, in future practical work, there will be unprecedented smooth operation. (23rd Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanking - The method for electing representatives of professional organizations stipulated in the National Delegate Election Law has many obstacles and difficulties in the election of representatives of journalists.

Now, the Bengbu Journalists Association has sent a telegram to respond to the claims of journalists in Beijing and Hankou, hoping that journalists across the country will jointly request the central government and the National Election Headquarters to find ways to remedy the situation and allow the journalists' associations that have been established and reorganized before the election deadline to participate together.

<h3>Japan's Cultural Envoys</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In his book "The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind," H.G. Wells has a section discussing modern diplomatic envoys, saying that the diplomatic officials stationed abroad in various countries mostly come from noble families due to past traditions. They only know etiquette and intrigue. Therefore, some even say that these diplomatic officials in the capitals of various European countries are almost the darlings of influential middle-aged women everywhere. They are the "prodigals" representing the country. In addition to diplomatic officials, various countries also send military attaches from the army and navy and commercial counselors. Then, Wells deeply regrets that the modern foreign ministries of various countries have not yet paid attention to sending cultural envoys to investigate the scientific work, philosophy, art, and social progress of the countries where they are stationed. Unexpectedly, our eastern neighbor, the literary minister, has risen up to be the first to advocate this initiative to do what this great modern thinker finds lacking in modern politics. Perhaps this multi-talented British historian will write a large special feature in a similar book when he rewrites “A Short History of the World.”</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Education has proposed cultural diplomatic envoys, who will be stationed in Washington, London, Berlin, and other places. What is their mission? What is their purpose? And whether or not it can become a reality? The telegram came, but the wording was not clear. We cannot speculate arbitrarily. However, if the establishment of cultural envoys becomes a reality, its significance will be unusual and can be asserted. We have already heard this year that young Japanese diplomat, the current ambassador to the United States, Saito Hiroshi, told the world that Japan has the responsibility to stabilize the backward areas of East Asia, which is similar to the United States and America. Japan's self-perception as a civilized country, capable of competing with Europe and the United States, is no longer in doubt. For China and other Asian countries to be backward areas, after several years of Japan's "Kingly Way" publicity and the pronouncements of this diplomat, it seems to have become a settled case long ago. So how can Japan be taken seriously in the eyes of Europeans and Americans? How can Europeans and Americans be made to recognize Japanese civilization? In Japan's view, there is a need to find a way to proceed. Due to this major premise, Japan's policies towards the world will inevitably be divided. Towards civilized countries in Europe and America, just as the Soviet representative said at this Pacific Conference, "We are unwilling to use force," because Europe and the United States are not backward areas, for the same reason as Japan. But for East Asia, "Japan does not hesitate to use force," because it is a backward area, and Japan bears the responsibility of developing backward areas. So for Western Europe, we see the proposal of the Japanese Ministry of Education to send cultural envoys. Not only that, but we also see that the "Japan Cultural Association" is preparing to convene an East-West cultural integration conference in Tokyo in 1940, inviting world-famous figures such as Wells, Tagore, Kidd, and Childe to attend and participate in discussions. This is also an unprecedented event. Whether this conference can become a reality is, of course, another issue. However, I believe that the frozen Western culture will not have any results from the discussions of these few famous people. If the essence of the world economy has not changed, and the world is still divided into two camps, aggressors and the aggressed, I believe that the East and the West will still be as sung by the British Empire poet Kipling, “East is East,” and “West is West.” Perhaps there is one point in which Japan can achieve its goal, and that is that convening these celebrities can recognize Japan as a country of Eastern civilization and the originator of the Kingly Way. However, people like Kidd and Wells are not particularly backward, and perhaps they may be put off by Japan's great mission.</p>
<p>As for China, it is natural to fulfill its responsibility of opening up backward areas. Economic development of North China is one of its important missions, and the complementary implementation of cultural policies must also be one of its necessary steps. We have heard of the establishment of industrial research institutes in Tianjin and Jinan. We have also heard of plans to establish Japanese language and culture lectures in national universities in Peiping. We have also heard of plans to establish libraries in Shanghai. Recently, there was news that Japan's cultural undertakings in China have slightly changed their direction due to the demands of various sectors in Japan. That is, to directly increase the economic welfare of the people, and to complement it with cultural welfare. Take economic development as the premise, and then with cultural indoctrination, so people can get a taste of this "good intention." Unfortunately, we people in this "backward area" cannot but have some concerns about this "good intention" of the "advanced country."</p>
<h3>Deadline for Exchanging Legal Tender Under Consideration by Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanking) The Ministry of Finance is currently formulating methods for setting the deadline for exchanging legal tender by province and by period. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities will be the first areas to have the deadline for exchanging legal tender set. The methods will be announced and implemented as soon as they are formulated. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Rises; Dikes Were Once Strained; Water Level at Lisheng Tun Gradually Falling</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River, carrying water from Shaanxi, passed through Shandong. From the 22nd to the 23rd, Lisheng Tun rose by more than one meter, and the water level reached 58.7 meters, which was 2 decimeters higher than the highest water level when the dyke broke last year. Luokou rose by 4.6 decimeters today. However, Lisheng Tun has gradually fallen tonight, and the peak of the water has passed, so it is hoped that there will be no incident. The dikes along the river were once strained, but they have been smoothly protected and stabilized. Kong Xiangrong is scheduled to come to Jinan from Qingdao early on the 24th, and will immediately go to the lower reaches to inspect and plan dredging. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) On the 23rd, the two layers of wattle fences in the lower part of the Fan Er Fort dyke in Huaxian County, Henan's Yellow River, were cracked by scouring by a series of small ditches. The Supervisory Office has jointly urged employees with the Lower North Sub-Bureau Chief to protect and fix the situation. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Two leaks suddenly appeared in the Nantuan dike in Jishi's Fourth Dykes area on the 22nd. Due to effective protection, they were blocked on the same day.

<h3>Hubei Provincial Government; Prevent Xiang River Flooding; Decides to Build Water Barrier Dam and Reservoir</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial and Municipal New Life Movement Association Established</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong Provincial and Municipal New Life Movement Association held its inaugural meeting on the 22nd. President Chiang's representative, Chen Lifu, attended the meeting and delivered a training speech, saying, "Today, the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association is jointly established, which coincides with the beginning of the construction of new Guangdong. Everyone is eager for governance, which is also the best time for everyone to contribute to the country. The New Life Movement is the basic work of self-reliance and helping others, and it is also a major responsibility for saving oneself and teaching the country. Now, I will briefly describe its meaning and hope. The purpose, content, and methods of the New Life Movement have been detailed in the New Life Movement Outline, so I will not repeat them here. In short, the New Life Movement aims to improve the general public's knowledge and morality, so that they can get rid of the past habits of being scattered, decadent, listless, and disorganized. Individuals should have the conditions suitable for modern life, groups should become responsible and disciplined members, and the country should become a nation with self-defense capabilities, organizational capabilities, and productivity. National revival is based on this. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, we must start from the individual's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and take neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and certainty as the prerequisite standards, and finally achieve everything in line with the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. The above-mentioned standards are both plain and simple, and universal and long-lasting. Everyone can do it, and everyone can do it at all times. As long as you have this belief, pay attention at all times, pay attention to everything, and you can see immediate results. With your leadership position today, practice what you preach and then set an example to persuade and influence the general public in society. The transformation of customs will be rapid. Guangdong Province has always been the earliest in opening up the people's customs, and its activity and creativity are also the strongest. At this time of new political construction, getting rid of the old and ushering in the new is everyone's urgent hope. The speed with which they accept the new life will undoubtedly be better than that of other provinces. Social construction and political construction must advance simultaneously. Implementing new policies among people who practice the New Life Movement and improving the people's lives in the promotion of new policies will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. I deeply hope that you can be pragmatic, determine the steps for implementation, and work hard with the spirit of continuous improvement. If the people of Guangdong Province can practice the New Life Movement, then the source of the revolution will establish a new foundation, and the Chinese nation will have a new life."

<h3>Japanese-German Agreement Endangers World Peace: British, American, and French Representatives Question Japan at Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Yosemite Park, California, USA: The Pacific Institute continued its meeting today. The British representative questioned the Japanese representative, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, asking if it was true that Japan and Germany had already concluded an agreement. Yoshizawa replied that he was not speaking on behalf of the Japanese government, but he could state that there was no such agreement at present. As for what the country would do in the future, he could not predict at this time. The British and American representatives then spoke one after another, saying that if Japan and Germany reached an understanding, British and American public opinion would consider it to be of an imperialist nature and would inevitably oppose it. The French representative, the former Prime Minister of France, Sarraut, then spoke, expressing his pleasure at Yoshizawa's remarks. He said that if Japan and Germany were to reach an understanding, its nature would be neither an economic agreement nor a regional agreement. "Some people may compare the mutual assistance agreement between France and Russia with the Japanese-German agreement, but this is not the case. The various mutual assistance measures contained in the French-Russian agreement can only be applied to Europe, and Japan and Germany cannot use it as an excuse. In short, if Japan and Germany were to sign an agreement in the future, its significance would not be related to a collective security organization, and it would also create a novel situation internationally, forcing other countries to reconsider and study ways to consolidate peace, because maintaining peace is the common goal of all countries."

<h3>Anti-Russian United Front, Hungarian Regent Asks Hitler, and Will Meet with Mussolini. Germany Claims Russia is Making Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Regent Horthy recently went hunting in Tyrol, Austria. He also visited German leader Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Germany (in Bavaria). According to political figures, the Regent's trip was purely a private visit and had no other meaning.

<h3>German Ship Sets Sail in New York Harbor, Riot Suddenly Breaks Out on Board, Twelve Women Self-Tie with Iron Chains, German Newspapers Claim It Was Done by Communists</h3>

At that time, the rioters were all wearing fashionable evening dresses and boarded the ship in twos and threes. When a huge firecracker exploded on the pier, they launched the riot. The women participating in the riot all tied themselves to the railings of the ship with iron chains, so they had to be cut with an axe to be freed. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan's Next Year's Budget Estimate Exceeds 3.2 Billion Yen, Military Expenditure Swells</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) As of the 22nd, the budget estimates for the next year's budget of each province, except for the army's budget and a part of the budget of the Ministry of Finance and other provinces, have been submitted to the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The Budget Bureau is scheduled to start reviewing it at the beginning of next month. Among the estimates of each province, the Ministry of the Army has not yet decided, and some other provinces have also reserved the submission to the Budget Bureau due to various reasons, so the decided figures cannot be expressed for a while. As of today, based on the calculations that have been clarified, the total amount of new requests from each province reaches 1.35 billion yen. Adding the base budget of 1.88 billion yen for the next year, the total amount of estimated requests reaches a huge 3.23 billion yen, an increase of 430 million yen compared to the initial request amount of 2.8 billion yen for this year's budget.

<p>(Tokyo) Japan's naval air force will be based on the second supplementary plan in October, and the opening of the Kanazawa (Yokohama) and Zhenhai (Korea) naval air base will be the last. The first plan of 14 teams and the second plan of 8 teams, together with the 17 teams already established, will complete the entire array of the expected 39 teams. However, the established plan is mainly based on the international situation from the past and considers the recent international situation. However, for Japan, which is surrounded by the sea on all sides, the air defense array on the sea and in the sky cannot be said to be sufficient. Therefore, the naval authorities have established a new air force expansion plan to ensure complete security, and the initial year's expenses have been included in the next year's budget submitted to the Ministry of Finance. However, what should be noted is that the new air force expansion plan is different from the established plan. Contrary to the previous focus on the increase of air squadrons and other general facilities, the future will focus on the training of passengers and the improvement of the performance of aircraft. The increase of air squadrons will be gradually carried out, and efforts will be made to organize and strengthen the content with a small amount of funding. (23rd Allied Telegram)</p>

It should be noted that the aforementioned 10,000-ton cruiser "Canarias" has just been built recently. Until today, it has not participated in the revolutionary war. However, the actions of the ship yesterday have shown that its crew is in favor of the rebels. A telegram from Burgos also stated that Spanish rebel commander General Mola has moved his headquarters to Valladolid, which is closer to Madrid. However, the National Defense Council led by General Cabanellas is still in Burgos. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Rabat, French Morocco: Regarding the war situation in the Córdoba area of southern Spain, the news issued by the official and rebel forces in the country is obviously contradictory.

However, according to a message broadcast by the rebel radio station in Seville, the Red Army (referring to government troops) attacking Córdoba was expected, and the rebel forces had been preparing to defend against the battle for many days. When the Red Army came to attack today, our air force drove them back, and our army also launched a counterattack from the city, meeting with reinforcements coming from outside the city, defeating the government troops.

<h3>Unprecedented Bloody Battle in the Port of Gijón</h3>
<p>Bayonne, Southern France: Fierce battles occurred today in the ports of Gijón and San Sebastián in northern Spain. The war news transmitted from all sides is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Port of Gijón: Although the port is in the hands of the government troops, there are still remnants of rebel forces in the Cimadevilla district of the port, entrenched in deep trenches and high walls, which were only captured by the government troops today. The government troops were led by Congressman Peña, the leader of the labor militia, and Asturian miners holding explosives launched a fierce attack, supplemented by artillery and air force attacks from above and below, so that bombs fell like rain in the district. The places where the bombs landed caught fire in an instant, spreading throughout the district. At the same time, explosions occurred everywhere, and the sound shook the distance. Blood and flesh flew together with iron filings, which was unbearable to witness. When the government troops entered the district, a part of the rebel security team defected and joined the government troops, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the rebel remnants. The intensity of the battle can be called unprecedented, and the losses suffered were also significant. As a result, the rebel forces were defeated, and 150 people were captured alive. The rebellion in the port of Gijón was quelled. It is said that rebel officers at all levels were unwilling to fall into the hands of the government troops, so they shot themselves after the defeat, which can be said to be heroic.

<h3>Rebel Warships Bomb Sang City</h3>

The above decision is not within the bureau's authority. The bureau recently received a letter from the Director of the Madrid Postal and Telegraph Bureau, stating that all wired or wireless telegrams sent from Spain to other countries or from other countries to Spain can only be received and sent in designated telegraph offices within the country. After receiving this notice, the bureau immediately informed all signatory countries. This was done in accordance with the bureau's authority, and that is all. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

According to Sheal's explanation, the U.S. government has no authority to take other forceful measures regarding the Spanish civil war, except for morally and financially pressuring its merchants to adhere to the principle of neutrality, because the current Neutrality Act applies to international wars and not to civil wars.

<h3>Draft Non-Intervention Agreement; Hungary and Yugoslavia Agree with Reservations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Recently, the Yugoslav government also agreed to the French proposal for non-intervention in Spanish affairs, but with a reservation: that it should not set a precedent that would undermine the principle that any legitimate government may receive assistance from other countries in the event of a rebellion within its borders. It is learned from reliable sources that the non-intervention agreement will be completed by an exchange of diplomatic notes between France and other foreign governments concerned. It is reported that Britain and France have already exchanged such diplomatic notes. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Budapest - Regarding the draft agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war proposed by France, the Hungarian government has submitted a reply to the French Minister to Hungary, Maglas, stating that Hungary accepts the draft in principle but will only implement the various measures contained in the draft agreement when the negotiations currently underway between the countries concerned have achieved satisfactory results.

<h3>Soviet Union Strengthens Naval Power; Aims to Resist Japanese and German Aggression; Special Attention Paid to the Defense of Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Moscow Correspondence - After the Soviet Revolution, the expansion of land and air forces was pursued vigorously, but the strengthening of naval power lagged far behind. By 1927, when the construction of land and air forces had achieved some success, a supplementary plan was established. According to a statement by the Minister of the Navy in May 1929, "In the past two years, the Red Navy has been preparing for reorganization, disposing of six obsolete ships and building ten new ones, increasing its strength by a total of 13,000 tons." Since then, the Soviet Union has worked even harder to expand and reorganize, and today it has entered a period of construction. According to a report by Tukhachevsky, Deputy Chairman of the People's Commissariat of Defense, at the Central Executive Committee meeting earlier this year, "The Soviet Union's traditional shipbuilding policy has focused on submarines. This policy will be changed in the future to cover other types of ships. The Soviet Navy's budget has traditionally accounted for only 12% of the total defense budget, but it will be greatly increased in the future, and expansion will be carried out at the highest speed."</p>
<p>Red Fleet Deployment - The fleet is divided into five squadrons: Baltic, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Pacific, and Amur River, stationed in Leningrad, Kronstadt, Vladivostok, Posiet Bay, Sevastopol, Arkhangelsk, Khabarovsk, Nikolaevsk, and their formations are as follows: (1) The Baltic Fleet has three battleships (old-style converted) of 22,000 tons each, with twelve 30cm guns, and a speed of 22 knots; one training ship of 11,900 tons; one cruiser of 6,800 tons; two gunboats, one of 1,700 tons and one of 1,300 tons; twelve large destroyers of 1,300 tons; three small destroyers of 600 tons; seventeen torpedo boats; about fifty submarines of 1,000 tons or 800 tons; two submarine tenders of about 3,000 tons; and several other auxiliary ships. (2) The Black Sea Fleet has two battleships (old-style converted), one of 23,000 tons with twelve 30cm guns and a speed of 23 knots, and one of 11,000 tons with four 30cm guns; three cruisers, one of 7,600 tons with four 30cm guns and a speed of 33 knots, and two of 6,800 tons each with fifteen 13cm guns and a speed of 26 knots; one cruiser of 6,800 tons with fourteen 13cm guns and a speed of 23 knots; seven large destroyers of about 1,200 tons with a speed of 33 knots; twenty-two small destroyers of about 400 tons; three torpedo boats of about 400 tons; about twenty submarines of 1,000 tons or 800 tons; one submarine tender of 3,000 tons; and several other auxiliary ships. (3) The Caspian Sea Fleet has two gunboats of 600 tons and six torpedo boats of 580 tons. (4) The Far East Fleet (i.e., the Pacific Fleet) has about forty submarines of 1,000 tons or 400 tons; five destroyers of about 800 tons; dozens of high-speed submarine chasers; about fifteen auxiliary cruisers; and four icebreakers. (5) The Amur River Fleet has ten large gunboats of 1,000 tons with several 15cm or 12cm guns; seven small gunboats of 350 tons or 200 tons with two 8cm guns; and about thirty motorboats of 30 tons or 10 tons.</p>
<p>Lessons of the Russo-Japanese War - The Soviet government, mindful of the disastrous defeat of the Imperial Russian fleet in the Russo-Japanese War, is paying particular attention to the strength of the fleet in Vladivostok, which faces Japan across the sea, to control the Tsushima Strait and other areas. In addition to the fifty newly completed, state-of-the-art submarines patrolling the coast of the port, high-speed torpedo boats of 700 tons capable of traveling at 40 knots are also being built to strengthen the defense of Vladivostok in the future. The port has recently established a fully equipped weapons factory and shipyard, and work is proceeding very actively. According to investigations, the Soviet Union is currently building one aircraft carrier of 7,600 tons, two Class A cruisers of 15,200 tons, four Class B cruisers of 20,000 tons, and six submarines of 5,700 tons, totaling thirteen ships of 48,500 tons. All of this is aimed at Japan and Germany to prevent aggression. (Special Dispatch from the China United News Agency)</p>
<h3>German Economic Minister Schedules Visit to Paris; Adjust Economic Relations with France</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Governor of the Bank of France, Labeyrie, recently visited Germany to meet with the President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, Dr. Schacht. Dr. Schacht is now scheduled to visit Paris in return this week. National Socialists believe that Schacht's visit is not only an important event in terms of Franco-German economic relations but is also of great political significance, as Schacht is the first German cabinet minister to visit Paris since the National Socialists came to power. (Note: Former German Chancellor Brüning and former Foreign Minister Curtius jointly visited France in 1931 to negotiate the issue of war reparations with former Prime Minister Laval and former Foreign Minister Briand. Since then, no German cabinet minister has visited Paris.) (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Italian Labor Situation</h3>
<p>— By Zhu Xuefan</p>
<p>Since the Fascist Party's march on Rome on October 28, 1922, and Mussolini's assumption of power in Italy, Mussolini has wielded a resolute hand, implementing an autocratic system. Over the past fourteen years, sweeping changes have been made in party and government affairs, economic reforms have been introduced, and social construction has been actively promoted. The remarkable achievements have been universally recognized. As for labor policies, they have greatly developed under Fascist rule. During my stay in Italy, I made a special effort to investigate the labor situation and provide a brief overview of my findings for the reference of those in China engaged in the labor movement.</p>
<p>(1) Labor Policy Before 1922, factory production in Italy was not very developed. Workers were often incited and exploited by the Communist Party, engaging in strikes and demonstrations to carry out destructive activities. This led to an increase in worker unemployment and hardship in their livelihoods, which had a profound impact and was detrimental to the security of the nation and society. After Mussolini came to power, he promulgated the Labor Charter (勞働大戀章), under the principle of labor-management cooperation and mutual assistance, working together to develop production. Factories were prohibited from using closures as a means of dealing with workers, and workers were prohibited from using strikes as a form of coercion. At the same time, labor contracts were established, stipulating minimum wages, working hours, rest periods, various holidays, and so on. Both labor and management were required to strictly comply, and the government would punish either party that violated the Labor Charter. As a result, labor disputes were drastically reduced, not only ensuring workers' livelihoods but also generally increasing factory production.</p>
<p>(2) Labor Organizations Currently, there are 2,204,275 organized workers in Italy, divided into 22 industries, all under the jurisdiction of the National Confederation of Industrial Unions. There are provincial federations in each province and county federations in each county. The National Confederation has a chairman who leads the national labor movement. The current chairman is Tullio Cianetli, who also serves as a member of the Grand Council. Each provincial federation has a provincial chairman, and each county federation has a county chairman, all appointed by the higher levels. Each factory has a representative, elected by the workers. The National Confederation is the only organization leading the workers. Its main tasks include representing workers in resolving labor disputes, negotiating contracts, and creating worker welfare programs. However, the Confederation must be guided by the "Ministry of Corporations" (行業合作部), Ministry Gi Co-operation, which also guides the Confederation of Industrial Employers. Therefore, there is a real connection between labor and management.</p>
<p>(3) Worker Life Worker life is currently relatively stable, with a 48-hour work week and one day of rest per week. Wages for night work are higher than those for day work. Workers mostly spend their leisure time engaging in entertainment at clubs. These clubs are jointly operated by the Party and the factories and offer various sports, music, fencing, travel, swimming, rowing, and foreign language courses. Therefore, I believe that the lives of foreign workers are not that different from those of Chinese workers. Foreign workers emphasize exercise and outdoor travel, while Chinese workers mostly stay indoors or visit entertainment venues during their leisure time. As a result, foreign workers are physically fit and mentally alert. On the contrary, this is true not only of workers in our country but also of ordinary people, which is a cause for concern.</p>
<p>(4) Labor Courts If labor and management encounter disputes, the National Confederation of Industrial Workers first conducts an investigation. If no resolution is reached, the matter is submitted to the Labor Court for adjudication. The Labor Court is composed of one employer representative, one worker representative, one expert, one judge, and two jury members. The Court adopts a fair attitude towards the cases presented and adjudicates them based on the principles of the Labor Charter. After the adjudication, both parties must strictly comply. Therefore, when labor disputes arise, they are resolved very quickly, and the effectiveness is evident. In 1935, there were only 120 labor disputes in Italy, which shows the general cooperation between labor and management.</p>
<p>(5) Employment Services A national employment service is established, with branch offices in each province, under the leadership of the Ministry of Corporations. Unemployed workers can register their age, skills, experience, and family situation with the local employment service. Employers must hire workers through the employment service and are not allowed to recruit workers on their own. This method is stipulated by law, and employers who do not comply will be fined from 50 lire to 3,000 lire (one lire is equivalent to one-fifth of Chinese legal currency). According to statistics from the Rome Employment Service branch, in April 1936, there were 10,957 unemployed men and 599 unemployed women, totaling 11,556 people. The number of people placed in jobs by the service was 6,753 men and 523 women, totaling 7,176 people.</p>
<p>(6) Labor Insurance Before 1922, due to the underdeveloped state of labor insurance, workers suffered greatly when they encountered unemployment, illness, disability, and other accidents. After Mussolini came to power, he actively promoted the labor insurance system. In recent years, its effectiveness has become apparent. There are now state-run and privately run insurance bureaus specializing in labor insurance. Privately run insurance bureaus must be guided by the Ministry of Corporations and the Ministry of Finance. As for the types of labor insurance, they include unemployment insurance, tuberculosis insurance, old age and disability insurance, expanded maternity insurance (for female workers), and accident insurance. Except for accident insurance premiums, which are fully borne by the factory owners, all other types of insurance premiums are borne equally by labor and management. Taking unemployment insurance as an example, according to statistics from 1934, insurance premium income was 120,222,000 lire, and subsidy expenditure was 101,384,000 lire. As for the tuberculosis insurance bureau, its facilities and arrangements are very thorough. There are currently 12 large-scale hospitals with 22,000 beds. Therefore, Italians who regularly insure themselves with various types of insurance can be free from worries about their lives and afterlives.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the current labor situation in Italy, and it is not possible to cover all the details. As for the issue of labor training, it falls within the scope of the entire Italian youth training program, which I will discuss in a separate article. Written on the 15th day of the 7th month of the 25th year [of the Republic], at a hotel in Germany.</p>
<h3>Political Assassination Attempt to Seize Power: Russian Counter-Revolutionaries' Crimes Unforgivable; Prosecutor Asks for Death Sentence for All; Kamenev's Repentant Words Moving; Tomsky Has Committed Suicide Out of Fear</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The shocking case of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other 14 counter-revolutionary party members has reached a critical point. The defendants have all responded to the prosecutor's demand for the death penalty, claiming that they should all be shot. Each defendant only requested that the court allow them to say farewell to the workers. The attitude of each defendant was similar. One example can be used to imagine the others: the former Red Army commander Radok confessed and then asked the court to sentence him to death as a warning to those who betray the working class. After speaking, he collapsed and sat down, crying sadly. He was then helped out of the courtroom by bailiffs. When demanding the death penalty, the prosecutor severely criticized each defendant and loudly proclaimed, "This secret organization of political assassins is no different from wild beasts. They must pay with their heads for their great crime of betraying the motherland!" At the same time, an announcement was released stating that Tomsky, a veteran Soviet trade union leader, had committed suicide because he was involved in the counter-revolutionary activities of Trotsky, Zinoviev, and other terrorists and could not exonerate himself. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Kamenev, who is being tried with 15 others for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities, said to the court today in his final address that the Soviet Union must still take extreme precautions, because Trotsky, who is still at large abroad, will continue to send secret agents deep into the country to engage in terrorist activities. Kamenev delivered his last will to his three sons, wishing them to convey it to the nation's youth. One of his sons is currently serving as an aviator in the Red Army. Kamenev instructed his three sons to love Stalin, whom he called the world's greatest labor leader, and said that he had brought about his own death by violating Bolshevik discipline, and wished that the nation's youth would never repeat his mistakes. He concluded by saying, "I am not afraid of death. Since I could not serve the revolution during my life, I now intend to do my part at the moment of my death." (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Prosecutor Vyshinsky, in his speech on the Trotskyite case, said that the defendants' opposition to our socialist motherland, their purpose, and their crimes are truly frightening and shocking. These criminals and murderers raised their hands against the leaders of the Communist Party, against Stalin, Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Kaganovich, Ordzhonikidze, Kossior, and Yezhov. Their crimes are truly frightening and shocking. These bandits committed heinous crimes. They killed Kirov, a hero of the working class who will never be forgotten."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky quoted Stalin's words, "The growth of Soviet power will simultaneously strengthen the resistance of the last remnants of the overthrown classes," pointing out that this trial has once again demonstrated how great the enemy's hatred is for the enormous success of socialism. Vyshinsky described the main successes of Soviet socialist construction, vigorously praising the solid and unbreakable unity of the laboring masses around Stalin, around the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party, and around the Soviet government. The huge wave of anger of the Soviet people against the vile assassins, which is currently engulfing the whole country, is a "clear proof" of this unity.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky described the nature of the defendants' crimes, denying that their attempts were "the actions of pure politicians," and said that "this kind of attempt is only a mask for their political emptiness and lack of any ideals. They are not politicians, but bandits of assassination, crime, and theft. They attempted to plunder state property - this is what they did. These gentlemen admitted that they did not have any plans, but they did have their domestic and foreign policies. Their domestic policy can be explained in one word: 'kill.' And seizing power was only an ideal to urge them to fight. In the past, they struggled against the Soviet government and the Party by means of sabotage and difficulties. Now they have lifted their masks and admitted to the victory of socialism in our country. This victory prompted them to rebel against the Soviet government. Because they were helpless, completely isolated, and had no hope of adopting other means to seize power, they resorted to terrorism and assassination. Terrorism is the basis of their entire activities and of the Trotskyite alliance. This is fully proven because some people did not associate with their secret work. All their anger and hatred is concentrated on the leaders of the Communist Party and the Political Department, the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Stalin, and his glorious armed comrades, because it is under their leadership, under Stalin's leadership, that the counter-revolution of Trotskyism was forced to fail. Trotsky wrote to some foreign Party members and assassins, ordering them to assassinate Stalin. He recruited Party members to organize terrorist actions, attempting to assassinate the leaders of our Party and country. Trotsky's terrorist order is indeed the foundation for the development of various activities of the United Center, and can be regarded as a conclusion. The ideas of Trotsky in organizing the United Center and adopting terrorist means were accepted by the Trotskyite secret agents. Zinoviev also agreed with this idea, accepting Trotsky's order as the basis of action for the United Center and the secret agents. The most important point in this trial is that they realized their counter-revolutionary ideas in counter-revolutionary incidents by adopting terrorist means. They not only talked about shooting, but they actually carried out shootings, and Kirov was a victim of their shooting."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky explained that the defendants' foreign policy was a frank hope for defeat. According to their confessions, Trotsky had set them a goal, that is, to take advantage of any failure in the war to seize leadership. Unite and arm the dissatisfied masses, organize rebellions against the Soviet government. Years ago, Trotsky declared the "Clemenceau thesis," saying that when the enemy is only eighty kilometers away from Moscow, the Soviet government should be armed and resisted. This is their "foreign policy."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky said that the methods used by the defendants were one of the most shameful pages in their criminal lives. "They widely adopted a fence-sitting policy as their main method of dealing with the Party and the government. Zinoviev told his Party members, 'When being investigated, deny any connection to this group and argue that terrorism is inconsistent with the views of Bolshevism and Marxism.' Trotsky also made the same statement. In the summer of 1933, when the United Center was preparing to commit terrorist actions against Stalin, Zinoviev sent a letter to its Central Committee, in which he admitted to various past mistakes and feigned loyalty to socialism and the Communist Party. On June 16, 1933, Zinoviev published an article in Pravda, in which he used various methods to express his loyalty to the Party, vehemently condemned opportunism, and praised the victories achieved by the Party. In the same summer, he ordered Kaiaev to begin implementing terrorism. After the death of Kirov (who was killed by Zinoviev), Zinoviev wrote an article in Pravda mourning him, saying, 'The loss of this comrade of mine, who was loved by all, makes everyone feel the loss of a close and infinitely dear person.' The vile assassin shed tears for his victim." Vyshinsky sighed and said, "Where and when has there ever been anything like this? What else can I say? What words can I use to exhaust the despicable and hateful nature of this desecration, treachery, and fence-sitting?" In 1933, Kamenev severely criticized his own mistakes in Pravda and tried to prove that he had broken with his old friends. At the same time, he was convening meetings to discuss the issue of implementing terrorist actions against the leaders of the Party and government. Treachery and hypocrisy are the basic methods of their criminal acts."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky described the actual actions of the United Center and the nature of the crimes of each defendant, saying that the union of the Trotskyite counter-revolutionary groups in the autumn of 1933 was based on the common recognition that terrorism was the only effective way to seize power. This struggle was the main goal of Trotskyism at the time. The investigation of the Kirov assassination case did not prove the direct participation of Kamenev, Zinoviev, Yevdokimov, and Begayev in this assassination. Although at that time their entire policies had already proved that they incited assassination in a hypothetical tone and created reasons for it. Therefore, in January 1935, a lenient judgment was announced against Kamenev and Zinoviev. They tried their best to conceal the true organizers and accomplices in this criminal incident.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky quoted and compared the detailed confessions of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yevdokimov, and Begayev in the 1935 trial and in this trial, exposing how they attempted to escape the responsibility for creating the terrorist center and all its activities, showing how Zinoviev and Kamenev were forced to remove their masks and admit their responsibility for terrorist actions and their guilt in the Kirov assassination and in preparing to assassinate other Party and government leaders because of the undeniable confrontation of confessions.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky said, "The terrorist center did exist, and more importantly, it was organized by the direct orders of Trotsky to Zinoviev and Kamenev, was directly guided by Trotsky regarding terrorist actions, and was carried out under extremely rebellious conditions, using their relationship with the German fascists and the German Gestapo, such as Dukalevsky and Himmler."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky described the defendant Smirnov, saying that Smirnov, along with Zinoviev and Kamenev, was responsible for the remaining activities of the terrorist center, and was the creator and leader of the entire Trotskyite counter-revolutionary group, accepting and transmitting Trotsky's terrorist orders, and his various attempts to deny these facts in court were only to hope to escape his criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>Taerfangangyang was also a member of the Trotskyite center, actively participated in the organization of the center, organized terrorist groups, and therefore should be responsible for various preparations for terrorism and the assassination of Kirov. Rheinagelt, Bickel, and Treichel organized a so-called assault terrorist center in Moscow and plotted to assassinate Stalin and Voroshilov.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky continued to describe the responsibilities fulfilled by Trotsky, saying, "Trotsky is not only the soul and founder of secret parties and the preparation of criminal groups, but also the encourager, founder, and organizer of the Trotskyite center. At the same time, Trotsky personally sent some of his party members to the Soviet Union. These party members were all well-known to him. Therefore, Sidov (Trotsky's son)'s friend Olberg, with the help of the Gestapo, used a Honduras citizen's passport to come to the Soviet Union to prepare to assassinate Stalin. Trotsky knew that the person would fail, so he summoned Erman Yulin, persuaded him, encouraged him, and sent him to the Soviet Union. Bermann Yulin and Fritz David were both Trotsky's agents and had been tested and interrogated by Trotsky. This has proved that Trotsky made them his agents and terrorists. From this, we can see how important the mission entrusted to them by Trotsky was. The materials obtained in previous and court investigations completely and absolutely prove the crimes of Naran Rolla (the leader of the terrorist group founded by the German fascist Weitz), Moserolla, and other defendants."</p>
<p>Vyshinsky believed that the conspirators' plan to appoint Bekayev as the chairman of the "OGPU" in order to destroy their criminal traces, and the suicide of Zinoviev's secretary Bogden, was forced by terrorists. These confessions have also been fully explained.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky said in conclusion that the end is near, and we are about to settle their huge crimes against our great country. They were once in our ranks, but they never resolutely adhered to the path of socialism. A tragic and shameful ending is waiting for them. We currently have dangerous, stubborn, barbaric, and vicious party members who endanger our people, our leaders, our struggle, and the leaders of the Soviet Union and the working masses of the world. We should not have any pity for these cunning enemies. The entire people are now furious. To the millions of Soviet people and the working people of the world who are calling out with excitement, I should agree in the capacity of representative of the National Procuratorate, and echo with the abhorrent and indignant voice of the National Prosecutor. I demand that these mad dogs, without exception, be all shot." (The entire audience responded with prolonged applause.) (TASS, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Implementation of Land Tax Reform in Fujian Province; Deadline of Eight Months for Completion</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province's land tax has always lacked standards, and the resulting malpractices have not only made the government's treasury revenue uncertain, but also caused considerable suffering to the people due to inequality. Currently, the government's finances rely primarily on special business taxes, followed by slaughter taxes, livestock taxes, and broker taxes. According to the budget for the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], land tax and poll tax were budgeted at over 2,670,000 yuan, but in reality, only 80%, or 2,000,000 yuan, was collected. Given the province's 61 counties and one city, the total land tax revenue is less than that of a single large county in Jiangsu or Zhejiang provinces. According to the recent survey by the provincial government's statistics office, the province has 17,700,400 mu of land. However, the fact that the average grain levy on the people is about 2.3 yuan per mu, including surcharges, proves the inequality of the people's burden: those who pay bear too heavy a burden, while many avoid payment altogether. Moreover, the county treasury clerks and runners engage in various malpractices, such as embezzlement and overcollection, which are also substantial. The government, deeply aware of the people's hardship and aiming to increase treasury revenue, has decided to implement land tax reform. The proposal was submitted by Finance Director Si Lie at the 86th meeting of the provincial government committee this month, and was approved, to ensure that no land is omitted, that the grain has a definite owner, that the people's burden is equal, and that the government's treasury revenue is certain, in order to promote political progress. Seven key points were decided: (1) Land tax reform is the most important central task of the 25th year [1936]; (2) The deadline is eight months for completion; (3) All counties are to issue orders to district office personnel, as well as Lianbao and Baojia heads, to fully mobilize and implement the reform; (4) The Land Administration Bureau is the responsible agency, responsible for all planning and implementation guidance; (5) The Finance Department is the supporting agency, responsible for all fundraising matters; (6) All departments of the provincial government are to assist in the success of this matter with all possible means; (7) All orders and announcements are to be issued in the name of the provincial government. After these key points were decided, all efforts were to be made to implement them separately, complete them on schedule, and issue new land deeds and tax payment certificates, so that the people can directly pay taxes. It was also decided that the collection of new grain would begin in the 26th year [1937]. Based on the province's 20 million mu of land, the total tax per mu, including surcharges, would be one yuan, which would reduce the people's tax burden by slightly less than one-third, while the government's treasury revenue would increase to more than 20 million yuan. Once this is accomplished, other similar harsh and miscellaneous taxes can gradually be abolished.</p>

<h3>Gunfight Between Police and Bandits in Xiamen City</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: An unprecedented fierce gunfight between police and bandits occurred in Xiamen City on the 21st. Recently, a series of robberies have occurred in Xiamen. In addition to the detective team, the Public Security Bureau has established a special task force, with Director Shen Jinkang concurrently serving as the director, to secretly track down bandits. On the morning of the 21st, Shen received a secret report from a task force member that the bandits Zhang Sichuan and others had recently robbed the homes of Zhu Xianting on Jiaowei Road, a certain family at No. 180 Xiameng, and the overseas Chinese merchant Chen Zhitang in Caopucheng. Today, they gathered at Huacheng Teahouse at No. 139 Xianfeng Camp to rob the wealthy Chen family in Fuyou Palace. The next day, they will gather at Zhongshan Park to rob the wealthy Wu family on Siming East Road, and then flee back to Haicheng. Based on the report, Shen immediately dispatched task force member Sun Shaokang to lead six capable detectives disguised to arrest them. Sure enough, four people were sitting around a table drinking tea in front of Huacheng. One was wearing a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, one was wearing a white shirt and pants, and two were wearing white student uniforms. Sun pretended to be a cigarette buyer and entered the shop first. Special police officers Yang Shiren and Zhang Zhenwu also followed in. Once inside, Yang and Zhang unexpectedly grabbed a bandit each from behind. Unexpectedly, a bandit sitting nearby immediately drew a gun and fired. Yang was shot in the left forehead and fell to the ground. The two bandits broke free. At this time, detectives outside the shop also rushed in, and the bandits and police exchanged fire. Gunshots rang out everywhere, and bullets fell like rain. The black-clad bandit burst out the door and fled, but was shot and fell to the ground. The remaining three bandits fled to the road. Coincidentally, the Marine Corps barracks were across the street. More than ten soldiers heard the gunshots and came to assist. They encountered the three fleeing bandits and fired two volleys of shots into the air. The bandits fled, and the detectives chased after them, capturing two of the bandits. The remaining bandit escaped. Two Mauser pistols and one revolver were seized. The black-clad bandit was shot four times and died on the spot. Policeman Yang had a bullet lodged in his head, and blood flowed from his mouth and nose. He died of his injuries after being sent to the hospital for treatment. One captured bandit identified himself as Zhang Sichuan, and another identified himself as Gao Xu, also known as Ji Wenfang. They confessed that they were responsible for the robbery in Caopucheng. They were immediately detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Water Patrol Team Captures Bandits</h3>
<p>He Dayou and Sun Rongsheng, both from Shaoxing, jointly founded Heshengji Shipping Company, specializing in transporting goods from Zhangkan, Luxiang, and Zhangze to Shanghai. Yesterday at noon, the ship set off from Shanghai loaded with many packages of flour, tea, sugar and other goods, worth several hundred yuan, and sailed to Songjiang. At around 9:00 PM, it arrived at Zhangze Port to wait for the tide and temporarily stopped. At around 11:00 PM, two Jiangbei boats suddenly approached the ship. More than ten people boarded the ship, led by two people each holding a pistol, and ordered the six crew members of Heshengji, including A-Quan, to be tied up. They looted the cargo and stole seven copies of freight manifests, over thirty silver dollars, fifteen thousand copper coins, and clothes. The bandit ships sailed eastward. The shipping company immediately went to Songjiang overnight to report to the water patrol team. After receiving the report, Captain Fei Gongxia immediately supervised the police officers and personally took the Yun Jian [Cloud Room] steamboat to pursue them. At 6:00 AM this morning, they saw two Jiangbei boats parked in Minhang Zhongchao Port, which were quite suspicious. As they were searching, a bandit swam away. The police officers also went into the water and caught him. They immediately found the stolen goods on the boat. The bandits Zhang Yaoqi, Wang Pengshi, Zhang Xiaonizi, Wang Dejin, Zhang Genbao, Zhang Qianshi, Lu Chenshi, Zhang Guiying, Chen A-si, and four children, along with the bandit boats and stolen goods, were brought back for interrogation. It is said that the two main bandits happened to land seven li away, so they escaped the net.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Giant Python Discovered in Meicun</h3>
<p>There is a large abandoned tomb in the second district of the county, near Meicun Town, commonly known as Yantai Tomb. The tomb has a double-layered enclosure wall, but it is located in a remote and desolate area, rarely visited by people. Yesterday, villagers came to the city to report that a large python had been discovered on the upper part of the enclosure wall inside the tomb two days ago. It was over four zhang [approximately 13 meters] long, completely black, with a diameter of one chi [approximately 33 cm], and a head as big as a dou [approximately 10 liters], with bright, piercing eyes. At the time, a villager caught a glimpse of it and mistakenly thought it was a black wooden electric pole lying on the enclosure wall. When he returned to the tomb, he realized it was a giant python and was greatly frightened. He rushed to Meicun Town and told everyone he met. When the crowd went to see it, the snake had already disappeared. It is said that giant pythons have been discovered twice in the tomb in the past twenty or thirty years.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Riverbank Collapse and Emergency Rescue</h3>
<p>The riverbank in Tongyi [Nantong] has been collapsing more and more severely recently. The two hills of Huangni and Ma'an are about to fall into the river. The people of Yao Dong and various weirs [polders] have been automatically reinforcing the dikes to defend against the tide. The Construction Bureau is implementing an emergency project to reinforce the riverbank with stone, and the county government has allocated 17,000 yuan for this purpose.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Huaiyang Garrison Command Moves to Yangzhou. The Huaiyang Garrison Command, originally stationed in Qingjiang, was ordered by the Ministry of Military Administration to move to Yangzhou for the convenience of military service. Commander Yang obeyed the order and sent personnel to Yangzhou to survey and select a location to station. They chose Wanshou Temple. The command's soldiers have already traveled south from Qingjiang yesterday. Commander Yang Tingya also arrived in Yangzhou at around 4:00 AM on the 22nd. Upon receiving the news, the Jiangdu Military Service District Command sent a delegation to welcome him into the city at the riverbank.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Major Disturbance at Jin Sinang Bridge</h3>
<p>On the 17th, the Zhejiang Border Inspection Office found a passenger named Huang Jinlong carrying a handgun in a car on the Shanghai-Pinghu Road. He was sent to the county for interrogation. Huang confessed that his friends Lu A-Da and Lu A-Huai also had handguns and were currently in Jin Sinang Bridge Town. Therefore, the county supervisor led a detective team and brought Huang Jinlong as an informant to arrest them. They arrived at the town and found the Lu brothers gambling in a teahouse. They were immediately apprehended. As they were about to return to the city, they suddenly heard a noisy crowd approaching from afar. Before they had gone halfway, they heard shouts and were being chased by a crowd of about a hundred people. Fearing that they would be snatched away, they shot the Lu brothers. A-Huai was seriously injured and fell to the ground, and A-Da died on the spot. Huang Jinlong escaped in the chaos. The detective team, fearing for their lives, fled to the township head's office and telegraphed the county government. Upon receiving the report, County Magistrate Wang led armed police officers and telegraphed the garrison in Zhapu to rush to the scene. However, everyone had disappeared. The village head was also missing. The supervisors and others were unharmed. They then went to Lu A-Huai's house and arrested his wife, Mrs. So-and-so, and took her to the county.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Continued Joint Operation on Jiangguang Road</h3>
<p>The Jiang (shan)-Guang (feng) Highway on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border is operated by the Highway Bureau in Zhejiang Province, while the Guangfeng Automobile Company operates the Jiangxi Province section. To facilitate passengers, both parties previously negotiated and signed a contract to operate joint passenger and freight transport, with a joint transport station at Xintangbian Station. Now that the contract has expired, the Highway District Administration Office and Guangfeng Company have negotiated to renew the contract for another year, and the plan has been submitted to the Construction Department for amendment and approval for record.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Promising Cotton Harvest in the Eastern Region</h3>
<p>The sandy and fertile soil of Guali, Nanyang, Dangshan, and other places in the eastern region of Xiaoshan is suitable for growing cotton. Every year, the harvest is transported and sold to other places in large quantities. The climate this summer has been favorable. If there are no special climate changes in the next half month, it is estimated that each mu can yield more than 200 jin. In addition, the American cotton planted in the cotton trial planting experiment zone is expected to be more abundant than in previous years.</p>

<h3>Effective Methods for Preventing Rice Stem Borers, Aphids, and Locusts (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Fuzhen, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Zhejiang University</p>
<p>There are many types of agricultural pests, among which the three most widespread and damaging are rice stem borers, aphids, and locusts. According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station: In 1933, the loss of crops nationwide due to rice stem borers was valued at 14.7 million silver dollars; in 1934, the loss of cotton nationwide due to aphids was valued at 10 million silver dollars; in 1935, the loss of rice in Jiangsu Province alone due to rice stem borers was valued at 11 million silver dollars. Currently, our country is striving for self-sufficiency in food and cotton, so we must do our utmost to prevent and control the above three types of pests. Now, I will briefly discuss effective methods for preventing and controlling them:</p>
<p>(A) Rice Stem Borers</p>
<p>Rice stem borers are pests of rice. Their names vary greatly from place to place. Some places call them "floating insects," some call them "white stalk insects," and some call them "heart-drilling insects"... Different views lead to different names.</p>
<p>There are distinctions between the two-brood rice stem borer, the three-brood rice stem borer, and the large rice stem borer. The "two-brood" rice stem borer generally has two generations per year, so it is called the two-brood rice stem borer; the three-brood rice stem borer generally has three generations per year, so it is called the three-brood rice stem borer; although the large rice stem borer also has three generations per year, it is called the large rice stem borer because it is the largest of the three types of rice stem borers. Although their types are different, their life habits and damage are mostly similar, so the prevention and control methods are also roughly the same. Now, to save time, I will take the three-brood rice stem borer, which is the most damaging of the three, as a representative to explain.</p>
<p>(1) The Life Cycle of the Rice Stem Borer</p>
<p>The rice stem borer is an insect with complete metamorphosis. Its life cycle has four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The eggs are laid on the seedlings and rice leaves, in clusters of thirty or forty to over a hundred, arranged overlapping each other, covered with brownish-yellow scales, and appearing like half a soybean. The larvae that hatch from the eggs undergo more than a month, molting five times, before turning into pupae. After another five or six days, they turn into adults—the rice stem borer moths. This cycle of growth completes three generations in a year. The third generation of larvae, when the rice is mature and the weather is gradually getting colder, hides in the rice roots to overwinter. Then, in the middle and late May of the following year, when the weather gradually warms up and the seedlings grow, they pupate and turn into moths again, flying to the seedling fields and laying eggs on the seedling leaves. The larvae that hatch from the eggs bore into the seedling stems, causing the seedlings to turn yellow and die; this is the first generation. By mid-July, the second generation of larvae appears. At this time, the rice fields are often damaged by "dead heart rice," forming round clusters, the size of a farmer's bamboo hat, so farmers call it "bamboo hat blight." By mid-August, the third generation of larvae appears. At this time, the rice is in the heading stage, and the rice that is eaten by them becomes white spikes. Therefore, rice fields with and without rice stem borers are very easy to distinguish. The reproductive capacity of rice stem borers is very strong, which is why they are so damaging. Assuming that each rice stem borer moth lays one hundred eggs as a standard, and calculating half male and half female, by the third generation, it can reproduce to 250,000 rice stem borers. Therefore, if a few rice stem borer moths remain in the seedling fields in the spring, by autumn, only white spikes will be seen in the widespread rice fields.</p>
<p>(2) Effective Prevention and Control Methods for Rice Stem Borers</p>
<p>There are many methods for preventing and controlling rice stem borers. Now, I will talk about several effective and easy-to-implement methods:</p>
<p>(1) Egg Removal Egg removal means folding off and burning the egg masses laid by rice stem borer moths on seedling leaves or rice leaves. Egg removal can be carried out in three stages: The first stage is egg collection in seedling fields. However, egg collection in seedling fields is difficult to implement in the old-fashioned seedling fields of the Jiangnan area, where there are no walkways. Therefore, to collect eggs in seedling fields, it is necessary to first implement modern seedling fields. The method of modern seedling fields is to sow the rice seeds into four-foot-wide strips, with a one-foot-wide path between every two strips, so that people can walk when collecting eggs. When the seedlings grow to three or four inches high in early May, it is necessary to patrol the seedling fields, and if egg masses are found, they should be collected at any time. The egg collectors must bring a stick and a cloth bag, and on the sunny side, gently move the seedling leaves with the stick, watch carefully, and move forward slowly. When egg masses are seen, they should be collected into the cloth bag. After the collection is completed, they should be gathered and burned. Egg collection in seedling fields must be carried out at least once every three days. This work is very simple, as long as one has good eyesight and can walk in paddy fields, almost anyone can do it. However, children with moderate bodies and sharp eyes are particularly suitable for this work, and parents should make good use of them. Egg collection in seedling fields is inevitably missed, so when the second generation of egg masses occurs in mid-July and the third generation of egg masses occurs in early August, egg collection in the fields should be carried out, which is the second and third stages of egg collection. The method of egg collection in the fields is the same as that in the seedling fields, but the area is larger, the work is more time-consuming, and it must be done once a day.</p>
<p>(2) Larva Removal Rice stem borer larvae overwinter in the rice roots, as mentioned above, so the best way to remove larvae is to dig up the rice roots in winter and destroy them all. The larvae hidden in them can then be killed. There is no special method for digging up rice roots. After the rice is harvested and before the next crop is planted, use a hoe or spade to dig them up, and then choose the following methods for disposal:</p>
<p>(1) Stack the rice roots and river mud in layers, and then cover the surroundings with river mud. After the rice roots have rotted, they can be used as fertilizer.</p>
<p>(2) Dig a deep pit, bury the rice roots in the pit, and use them as fertilizer after they have rotted.</p>
<p>(3) Mix them with dry rice straw, pile them in the field, and set them on fire.</p>
<p>(4) Dry the rice roots and use them as fuel.</p>
<p>In addition to digging up rice roots to kill larvae, there is also a method of flooding and soaking. That is, in rice fields where no crops are planted and where water conservancy is very convenient, flood the fields so that the larvae hidden in the rice roots suffocate and die. The depth of the flooding should be appropriate to submerge the rice roots. The flooding period should be more than two months.</p>
<p>(3) Moth Removal The best way to remove moths is to do it during the seedling stage. On the one hand, use insect nets to catch and kill them; on the other hand, use the phototropic habits of rice stem borer moths to lure and kill them by lighting lamps next to the seedling fields. This lamp is called a moth-luring lamp. The installation is very simple. Usually, a tripod can be set up on the field ridge, with a strong kerosene lamp hanging on it. Place a round basin three feet in diameter directly below the lamp, fill the basin half full with water, and add a few drops of kerosene. The distance between the lamp and the basin should be about seven or eight inches, and the distance from the lamp to the ground should be about six feet. Turn on the lamp every night from 7:00 pm to 12:00 am. When the rice stem borer moths see the light, they will fly to the bottom of the lamp, fall into the water, and die from the oil. Usually, one lamp is lit per acre of field. If there are too many rice stem borer moths, the number of lamps should be increased appropriately to increase the effect.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned methods of treating rice stem borers can be implemented step by step, then the damage from rice stem borers can definitely be eliminated. However, three points should also be noted:</p>

After Chen, et al., exchanged pleasantries with those who came to welcome them on the ship, they disembarked and returned to their residences to rest. Because Finance Minister Kong is about to return east, they do not plan to go to Lushan and will stay in Shanghai to await his arrival.</p>
<p>Chen and Tang Talk</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Chen and Tang on the ship. According to Chen and Tang, their visit to Guangdong this time to inspect the financial situation and carry out currency reform matters has been successful. All the reorganization plans and reform measures were stated in detail in the previous declaration of Minister Kong. The Central Government is now preparing to subsidize Guangdong Province's finances with 82.2 million yuan as a first step, including 16 million in cash and the rest in public bonds, to gradually recover the silver dollars and stabilize the market price, so as to balance with the legal tender. Then, the silver dollars will be formally reorganized to complete the legal tender system. Regarding the establishment of a Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank, preparations are actively underway, and the selection of the director has not yet been decided. It can be established. As for Hong Kong, there is no need to establish a branch for the time being. Director Song (Ziliang's) financial situation has gradually improved, and the future is very optimistic. The Guangxi incident has not yet been resolved, but it does not affect Guangdong Province's finances, et cetera.</p>
<p>Wu Qiding Talks</p>
<p>According to Wu Qiding, he told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter that since 1931, the Guangdong Province's taxation system has not been able to follow the orders of the Central Government, forming a special situation. This time, he was ordered by Minister Kong to go to inspect and start a reorganization. As for the reorganization methods, they will be decided after reporting to and requesting instructions from Minister Kong. However, the general principle is that the various taxes collected must not exceed 5%, so as to reduce the burden on the people, et cetera.</p>
<p>Bei and Zhou Remain in Guangdong</p>
<p>As for Zou Lin, the Political Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, who accompanied Song Ziliang to Guangdong to inspect and convey the Central Government's intention to reduce the burden on the people of Guangdong Province on behalf of Finance Minister Kong, and Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, and Zhou Shouliang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, who accompanied Tang Shoumin to the south, Chen Xing told reporters that Zou had flown directly from Guangdong to Lushan the day before to meet with Minister Kong and report back. Bei, Zhou, and Xu Kan, the Deputy Minister, are still in Guangdong and will return north later.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Industry Asks for Revision / Inspection Measures for Artificial Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association believes that the "Inspection and Clearance Measures for Domestically Produced Piece Goods Woven with Artificial Silk" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance are difficult to implement. It has telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the association to request revisions, and each has sent representatives to Beijing to petition. It was fortunate to be granted relief and ordered the Inspector General of the Jianghai Customs to review and report. Now, it is learned that the association has not received approval after ten days. Recently, the Shanghai Post Office has allowed each household to mail one package of silk, limited to a value of 55 customs gold units (equivalent to 120 national currency), which has caused merchants from all over the country to gather in Shanghai, all hesitating and not daring to buy goods. However, there are 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of Ge Ti transported from Zhoucun, Shandong, to Shanghai every day. The association believes that the circulation of smuggled goods is like this, while the restrictions on legitimate goods are so severe. At the beginning of the autumn sales season, goods will soon become outdated. If relief is not provided, not only will losses be worrying, but also tens of millions of silk industry workers and merchants will be plunged into despair. Therefore, the association convened a special executive committee meeting yesterday and resolved to publicly recommend Chairman Luo Qinghua Fang to submit a document again to Beijing to continue waiting for instructions. It was learned that the Hangzhou Silk Industry Association also believes that the inspection measures are very difficult and has telegraphed the Hangzhou Customs Supervisor and the Customs Commissioner to request their review and transfer to seek relief, and has recorded the telegram and letter to ask the association to preside over the handling. The original text of the letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Finance, respectfully submitted: The association believes that the "Inspection and Clearance Measures for Domestically Produced Piece Goods Woven with Artificial Silk" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance are difficult to implement. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the association have sent representatives to petition in person, and the Ministry granted relief. After ten days, no approval has been received, which is deeply worrying. The Shanghai shipping industry has already been virtually suspended, and recently the post office has limited the delivery of silk goods to 55 customs gold units per household, with a price below 120 yuan in national currency. At the beginning of the autumn sales season, merchants from all over the country are gathering in Shanghai, hesitating due to transportation delays or not daring to buy goods. Goods will soon become outdated. Not only will losses be worrying, but also tens of millions of silk workers and merchants will be driven into despair. Looking ahead, we are terrified. The most painful thing is that the Ti Wan from Zhoucun, Shandong, can be sold smoothly without obstruction. According to reports, 5,000 to 6,000 pieces are transported to Shanghai every day for dumping at low prices. The circulation of smuggled goods is like this, while the restrictions on legitimate goods are so severe, which is not the original intention of the Ministry. According to the regulations of the post office, with a price limit of 120 yuan, each piece of Ti Ge produced in Shandong, which is only worth about 4 yuan in national currency, can be sent in batches of 30 pieces. As far as the flow of money is concerned, there is no more smuggling to be inspected. Under this situation, hundreds of thousands of silk merchants and machine households affiliated with the association in Hangzhou, Huzhou, Suzhou, Sheng, and other places are suffering deeply and hating the smooth sale of smuggled goods. The result of anti-smuggling has become the protection of smuggled goods and the destruction of domestic products. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel sad and angry. Therefore, we are sending Chairman Luo Qinghua Qi again to submit a petition and continue to wait for instructions, lest we be eager to await orders. Respectfully submitted to Kong, Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association.</p>
<p>Letter from the Hangzhou Association: Our association, etc., believes that the inspection and clearance measures set by the Ministry of Finance have various difficulties in implementation. On the 10th of this month, we telegraphed the Hangzhou Customs Supervisor and the Customs Commissioner to request a review and understanding. The original telegram is recorded below (omitted above). The Hangzhou Customs Bulletin No. 34 has been issued for the inspection and clearance measures for domestically produced piece goods woven with artificial silk or mixed with artificial silk, as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, and is scheduled to be implemented within a limited time. Our association, etc., believes that the measures have many difficulties in relation to the actual situation of the silk industry in this city and have raised various difficult problems. We have sent representatives to visit in person, and it was reported that the case was submitted to the Ministry of Finance. All domestically produced piece goods woven with artificial silk or mixed with artificial silk within the Hangzhou Customs area, regardless of silk merchants, silk factories, or retail machine households, must be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, etc. After detailed discussion, we have not been able to implement the following difficult situations: (1) Regarding the machine households in this city, there are about 6,000 or more retail machine households in this city, which are completely family-run handicrafts. Today, they weave a piece and must sell it in the silk market, selling as they weave and selling locally without direct transportation and sales. Moreover, the raw materials of artificial silk they need are supplied by the local artificial silk shops, which are purchased from the initial artificial silk importers in small amounts and several times. It is impossible to obtain tax bills. This is one. (2) Regarding the silk merchants, there are no less than hundreds of shops in this city that operate silk sales, which can be said to be the center of the silk industry in Hangzhou. The domestically produced piece goods they sell are entirely purchased directly or indirectly from the retail machine households in this city and the interior. When they sell to other places, they cannot obtain the machine household's tax payment certificate and exchange for a license. This is two. (3) Regarding the machine households in the interior, such as Huashe Xiafangqiao in Shaoxing, etc., the domestically produced piece goods they weave are either carried to Hangzhou for sale by the machine households themselves, or purchased by silk merchants and transported to Hangzhou for sale. When they are shipped and distributed, they also have no way to obtain a certificate to exchange for a license. This is three. (4) Regarding the silk factories, since the economic panic tide, its impact on the development of the silk factories in this city has been very profound. Currently, there are no more than a few silk factories in this city that can be called silk factories. Before the machine households and silk merchants' license exchange methods are changed, the silk produced by the silk factories and the silk produced by the machine households will inevitably be difficult to distinguish. This is four. In short, the center of the largest output of silk piece goods in this city is tied to the retail machine households, and its silk merchants are the collective organization for its transportation and sales. Between the mutual relationship between these two, there are tens of thousands of difficulties in obtaining tax bills and exchanging for transportation licenses. At the same time, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association has a linked relationship with the situation of the silk industry in this city. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has previously submitted a detailed report to the Ministry of Finance and sent representatives to Beijing to petition. The Ministry of Finance has been detailed and clear, and has allowed the Inspector General of Customs to review and provide relief measures. For the implementation date, the Ministry also ordered to consider the family situation. The difficulties of the silk industry in Hangzhou are detailed on the left and right, and we request that you review and approve them and quickly forward them to the Inspector General of Customs for review and relief measures, and request that the implementation be delayed before the relief measures are reviewed and determined, so as not to cause the entire industry to stop. We cannot help but wait eagerly for orders. Hangzhou Silk and Satin Industry Association, Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, bowed and sealed together, and should be informed, to hope that the platform will be integrated, Ho.</p>
<h3>Legitimate Goods Transportation and Sales / Please Do Not Make Things Difficult / The City Chamber of Commerce Presents a Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, "Finance Minister Jian, on the 21st of this month, the anti-smuggling committee of the association held its sixth regular meeting. The director of the inspection team, Ti Yi, reported that since the government vigorously implemented anti-smuggling, although smuggled goods on Jianghai ships and road transportation have gradually disappeared, many traitors have changed the smuggled goods to be transported to the interior for sales by private boats, small ships, barges, or long-distance buses to avoid inspection. Anti-smuggling agencies in various places have not yet paid widespread attention. At present, due to anti-smuggling relations, legitimate goods are often transported and sold to various places, and they are often made difficult by inspectors, and are detained for no reason, hindering commerce. Please seek relief." It was unanimously agreed that the Ministry should issue an order to anti-smuggling agencies in various places to pay attention to the cargo transportation of private boats, small ships, highways, and buses, strictly prevent smuggled goods, and at the same time warn inspectors to facilitate the transportation and sale of legitimate goods and not to arbitrarily make things difficult. The discussion and decision were passed. We hereby telegraph the Ministry to review and implement it, which is convenient for the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce worships and supports.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xuefan / Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning / Arrives at 7:00 am / The Labor Union Prepares to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, who attended the 25th International Labor Conference as a labor representative, has arrived in Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde on the morning of the 25th. Various labor unions are preparing to welcome him. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrives in Shanghai on the 25th: Zhu Xuefan, the labor representative who was dispatched to attend the 20th International Labor Conference, went to Geneva to attend the conference on April 24 this year, and then went to Germany, Italy, Russia, and other countries to investigate the international labor cause. On August 31, he returned to China on the Conte Verde. According to the news from the ship company in this port, the ship is scheduled to arrive and dock at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong at 7:00 am on the 25th of this month (i.e., tomorrow).</p>
<p>Preparing to Welcome Him:</p>
<p>Because Zhu is about to return to China, the city's general labor union has specially appointed members Zhou Xuexiang, Zhang Kechang, Li Mengnan, Long Peiyun, Ye Xianggao, Gong Yuting, and Lu Muqin to prepare for the welcome, and has decided (1) to notify all labor unions in the city to send two representatives to the Xinguang Wharf to welcome him, (2) to hold a banquet for the labor community after Zhu arrives in Shanghai on a scheduled date, and to invite Zhu to report on his attendance at the conference and his investigation of the labor situation in various countries.</p>
<h3>Huang Guangrui Arrives in Shanghai / More Than Ten People Come with Him</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Guangrui, the newly appointed principal of the Central Aviation School, went to Guangdong to handle the handover procedures of the Air Force Command. He has now completed his work and, together with Zhou Zhirou, the former principal of the Central Aviation School, Ding Jixu, the former commander of the Guangdong Provincial Air Force, and more than ten personnel from the Air Force Command, came north by the Japanese Empress ship of Changxing Company from Hong Kong. He arrived in Shanghai at 3:40 pm yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Broadway Road. Those who went to welcome him included Wen Huayin, the deputy commander of the Security Regiment, and many others. After Huang and others got off the ship, they went directly to the New Asia Restaurant to rest. He is scheduled to go to Hangzhou today to take up his post. According to Huang, the current situation in Guangdong Province is significantly better than before. It is difficult to predict whether the Guangxi situation can be resolved peacefully. As for the situation in Guangxi Province, I don't know the details because I stayed in Guangdong for a short time. I am scheduled to go to Hangzhou to take up my post tomorrow (the 24th). The date of my formal appointment has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Free Professional Groups / Registration Books Will Soon Be Sent to Beijing / The Election Office Is Now Compiling and Verifying</h3>

It is heard that the election office, after verifying the roster sent by the Lawyers Association with the local court, found that more than 20 members had joined after the promulgation of the Election Law. The office has notified the Lawyers Association to inform the members that they cannot participate in the election. As for those who had indeed joined the association earlier, but have not been registered by the court, they can bring their certificates to the office or apply directly to the competent authorities to transfer the corrections, so as to comply with the procedures and re-elect the government.</p>
<h3>It is the Beginning of the Autumn Flood Season / The Construction Department Surveys the Baoshan Seawall / The Dike Blocking Work at Shitangkou and Other Places Is Completed / The County Government Telegraphes the Province to Quickly Allocate Flood Prevention Funds</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, after the collapse of the bank walls at Shitangkou outside Dongmen and Laoshidong in the Fifth District of the Baoshan Seawall, the county government not only quickly sought to block the breach by requisitioning labor, but also telegraphed the provincial government to allocate funds for prevention. Now the Construction Department has sent Chen Zhitian to the seawall for a survey, and has prepared a large number of sacks of sand and stone to fill the breaches. The details are recorded as follows by a reporter from Dagong News Agency:</p>
<p>The Breach Blocking Is Completed</p>
<p>Since the tail of the first hurricane in Shanghai struck on August 5, the dikes at Shitangkou outside Dongmen and Laoshidong in the Fifth District of the Baoshan Seawall were washed away by the flood tide, causing the bottom of the bank walls to loosen and collapse by about ten feet each. After hearing the news, the county government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to requisition labor on the spot and prepared more than 1,000 sacks to mix with pebbles, sand, and mud to rush to block the danger, and drove piles on the inner dike. Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong News Agency drove to the breach of the Baoshan County seawall to inspect. The project to block the breach of the dike has just been completed last week.</p>
<p>Provincial Officials Survey</p>
<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Government received the emergency telegram from Zhang Mingjing, the county magistrate of the county, it ordered the Construction Department to handle it quickly. Now Zhao Daihua, the director of the Construction Department, has specially sent Chen Zhitian, a water conservancy engineer, to Shanghai to go to Baoshan and meet with Section Chief Qi of the Third Section of the county government. They have been surveying the situation of the seawall dikes on the main and branch dikes for days in order to report everything to the province.</p>
<p>Flood Prevention Funds</p>
<p>Now that the autumn flood season is approaching, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been rising sharply in recent days. Baoshan is the hub of the water flow of the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Yangtze River. The location is dangerous. Although the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office has built the dikes in recent years, the dikes are quite solid, but it is necessary to prevent the sea tide from erupting in advance. Therefore, the county has telegraphed the provincial government to quickly allocate funds for prevention in order to prevent future troubles. It is now learned that the funds will be allocated immediately after being approved by the provincial government meeting.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiwai Summoned to Beijing Yesterday to Present Opinions on Revising Industrial Regulations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, regarding the revision of industrial regulations, had telegraphed the Chinese General Federation of Industry to nominate one representative to the ministry to personally present opinions. The Federation's committee publicly nominated Standing Committee Member Hu Xiwai as the representative and had already reported this to the Ministry. It is now learned that Mr. Hu, having been summoned by telegram from the Ministry, took the night express train to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night to reach the ministry, in preparation for consulting the industrial sector on their opinions regarding the revision of industrial regulations.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry Requesting Exemption of Repeated Business Tax for Fujian Tea Merchants</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, in order to request an order to exempt Fujian Province tea merchants from repeated business tax, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: We recently received a letter from the Fuzhou Minhou Silk and Tea Trade Association, stating that the tea industry is crucial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and cannot withstand repeated burdens. They earnestly request a detailed investigation and submission to the central government departments, with a clear order to the Fujian Provincial Government to swiftly abolish the special business tax on tea and handle the ordinary business tax for hongs according to regulations, in order to ensure fairness and save the tea industry. The case involves Bao Chong'an and Zheng Fuduan, representatives of the Maotea Public Guild Hengyuan Hall, and Sun Xi and Yang Renqi, representatives of the Guangfu Tea Guild Gongyi Hall, who stated that their guilds had previously requested that the Fuzhou Tea Industry Business Tax Bureau, upon order to reorganize the tea tax, establish an ordinary business tax for hongs. They petitioned at various levels, requesting permission to temporarily postpone the establishment of the general business tax before the special tax on tea was abolished, in order to avoid duplication and alleviate merchants' difficulties, which was already submitted on record. Now, they have received the Ministry of Finance's directive No. 10020 of the Fu character on July 8th, stating, 'The submission has been noted. Please consult the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate and comply accordingly.' This directive shows a desire to maintain [the industry], and we are extremely grateful. We should have waited quietly for compliance, without daring to trouble you further. However, in recent days, the personnel handling the business tax have intensified their efforts, urging payment more and more severely. They even sent letters to various hongs on August 4th, stating that the amount of business tax should be based on the amount of special tax already paid, and collected pro rata as the standard for levying ordinary business tax on hongs, requiring payment within three days, which is quite inappropriate. However, the business of the hongs is in a state of economic depression, and they have no desire for personal gain. Even if they stop business, they would not regret it. They only hope that the tea industry will consider the entire future, and they have deep concerns, so they cannot help but speak out. We believe that the tea industry in Fujian Province has recently declined dramatically, and the state of the disastrous defeat is truly pitiful. Examining the reasons, although it is due to foreign products occupying sales and blocked sales channels, the excessive burden and high cost are also factors in the failure. However, it is difficult to raise the price in the sales market, and if the burden is increased, the mountain base will inevitably be lowered, and the farmers' hard-earned income will not be enough to maintain their lives. Therefore, the abandonment of tea mountains is inevitable, and the impact is extremely significant. The government should have the necessity to help this serious social condition. We respectfully present our humble views again. (Omission) In general, hongs and tea merchants are originally integrated businesses, which is clearly different from the separate businesses of other tea firms and cannot be compared. Moreover, the special tax burden is already heavy, and since the order to abolish it has not been followed, the ordinary business tax for hongs is established again, which is actually a repeated levy. At this time of the disastrous defeat of the tea industry, it is already difficult to maintain it, so how can it be repeatedly levied? In addition to again presumptuously going to various agencies in the province to appeal, requesting that the ordinary business tax for hongs be postponed before the special business tax is abolished, if the ordinary business tax is to be implemented as ordered and cannot be stopped, then the business tax levied on special goods is respectfully requested to be abolished. In addition, we have stated the above reasons and requested the General Assembly to swiftly submit [this petition] to the Shanghai National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to uphold justice and submit it to the various departments of the National Government, requesting permission to issue a clear order to stop it, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and alleviate merchants' hardships. According to this, after investigating the various points stated by the two guilds, they are indeed true, and it is reasonable to submit this presentation. We implore your esteemed association to investigate and approve this presentation to uphold justice and submit it to the Central Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to issue a clear order to the Fujian Provincial Government to order the bureau to stop the repeated tea industry business tax, in order to preserve a glimmer of hope for the tea industry. We are deeply grateful. Respectfully, The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China." On this basis, we deem it appropriate to send a telegram to your esteemed ministry to respectfully request investigation and approval, requesting permission to consult the Fujian Provincial Government to stop the repeated tea industry business tax, in order to maintain the business of tea merchants, which is most earnestly prayed for. Sincerely, The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association's Second Fundraising Drive to End at the End of the Month; Achievements Exceed 200,000 Yuan; To Be Transferred to General Association for Custody</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association's second fundraising campaign has been underway, with prominent figures from various circles appointed as captains of fundraising teams. Since its commencement over a year ago, this campaign, aimed at concentrating popular support and assisting the government in strengthening national defense, has garnered enthusiastic support from various quarters. However, due to the severe economic downturn in recent years, the original objectives have not been fully achieved. Nevertheless, the current results are commendable. It is understood that the Association's second fundraising campaign is set to conclude soon. The number of new members joining the association is estimated to exceed 15,000, with donations and membership fees totaling approximately 200,000 yuan. These funds have been transferred to a financial custody committee under the China Aviation Association's general headquarters. The fundraising teams' headquarters are in the process of finalizing the fundraising efforts.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Urges the Ministry of Railways to Maintain Creditworthiness for the Shanghai-Zhejiang Railway Loan; Reduction of Principal and Exemption of Interest Impacts the Entire Domestic Debt; Plans to Accompany Bondholders to Petition the Ministry</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai, recently telegraphed the Ministry of Railways at the request of representatives from the Shanghai-Zhejiang Railway creditors, urging the Ministry to uphold its creditworthiness and allocate sufficient funds to cover both principal and interest. The telegram to Zhang, Minister of Railways in Nanjing, reads as follows: "Esteemed Minister Zhang, according to letters from Yang Qicheng, Yan Zhonglin, Wang Huaide, and other representatives of the Shanghai-Zhejiang Railway bondholders, the Ministry and liquidation office announced a reduction in principal and exemption of interest for the overdue final bond installments of the Shanghai-Zhejiang Railway. As their hard-earned money is at stake, they are unwilling to accept this unexpected loss and firmly oppose it. I, Yu Hede, was the signatory representing the nationalization of the railway and am requested to assist in advocating for their cause. In my opinion, the government invariably repays both principal and interest for foreign debts of Chinese railways, such as the Jinpu Railway, and even prepaid the outstanding British debt for this railway multiple times. However, for this overdue final bond installment, the government is reducing the principal and exempting the interest. This disparate treatment of domestic and foreign debts is unfair and will have a significant impact on the entire domestic debt market, which the government should avoid. I, Yu Hede, was the representative for the nationalization of the Zhejiang Railway. At the time, it was stipulated in the sale agreement that a branch line would be built from Yuyao to Longshan, but this has not been implemented for over twenty years, resulting in losses of over two million yuan for personal investments in Longshan Wharf and other facilities. This is a grave breach of trust by the nation towards its people. Now, to further reduce the principal and exempt the interest for this final bond installment is deeply regrettable. The bondholders have repeatedly come to me requesting redress, and I find myself unable to cope. Therefore, I plan to accompany the bondholders to your esteemed ministry to request full repayment of principal and interest. I am sending this telegram in advance, hoping you will investigate and swiftly order the preparation of sufficient funds to be available when we arrive to claim them, thereby maintaining creditworthiness. I eagerly await your reply. Sincerely, Yu Hede." He has already sent letters to each team and dispatched several external affairs officers to liaise with them to conclude the effort. It is reported that the results and receipts of each team are due to be submitted by the end of this month to facilitate the finalization and announcement.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Loan Syndicate Reorganized as the Agricultural Capital Bureau's Working Capital Syndicate; Negotiations Completed with Thirty Participating Banks; Each Bank Underwrites Capital; Board of Directors Established to Preside</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng She, the Ministry of Industry's joint establishment of the Agricultural Capital Bureau is nearing completion and is about to open. The method of handling agricultural loans by the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate has also been agreed upon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiating Reorganization</p>
<p>The Agricultural Capital Bureau has fixed capital allocated by the government, matching capital jointly underwritten by various banks, and working capital provided by a syndicate of banks. The fixed capital and matching capital for the 25th year of the Republic, each amounting to 6 million yuan, have been allocated by the government and underwritten by the banks. As for the working capital, Assistant Director Zou Bingwen has successfully negotiated with various banks to reorganize the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate into the Agricultural Capital Bureau's Working Capital Syndicate to handle agricultural loans. The reorganization will be announced upon the opening of the Agricultural Capital Bureau.</p>
<p>Participating Banks</p>
<p>The China Agricultural Loan Syndicate was established in the spring of the 24th year of the Republic. The initial participating banks were the Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank, Zhong Nan Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, New China Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, totaling ten banks. The syndicate's handling of agricultural loans proved quite effective. After the reorganization, in addition to the above ten banks, the Bank of China, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Sze Ming Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, The National Commercial Bank, China General Edison Company, China Merchants Bank, Chung Foo Union Bank, Ken Yeh Bank, The Farmers and Workers Bank of China, The Commercial Bank of China, Chuen Kung Bank, Tung Lai Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Post Office Savings Bureau, China First Trust Company, Central Savings Society, and Central Trust Bureau, totaling thirty banks, have joined.</p>
<p>Loan Procedures</p>
<p>The syndicate has decided to establish a board of directors to oversee agricultural lending. All participating banks will be directors. In addition to establishing a general office, regional offices will be established in agricultural areas of each province. At the beginning of each year, a board meeting will be held to determine the total amount of agricultural loans for each province and the loan recipients. All loans will be handled in accordance with the previous China Agricultural Loan Syndicate's procedures. Capital will be self-subscribed by each bank, with each unit being 50,000 yuan in national currency. The loans will primarily target major agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton, focusing on production and marketing loans. In addition, there will be loans for the construction of agricultural warehouses in various provinces.</p>
<h3>After the Smuggling Craze Started, Someone Conspired to Extort Minister Kong; Yan Jiezhi Was Trapped in the Hostel and Had Wild Ideas; Minister Kong Telegraphed Chairman Zhao Requesting to Handle It According to Law</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, recently a major extortion case has been rumored in Shanxi, involving the Jin Feng Hou firm, which is managed by Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, a reporter met a gentleman who had just come from Taiyuan and talked about the process as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Kong Has No Time to Take Care of It, Manager Is Responsible</p>
<p>Minister Kong is from Taigu County, Shanxi Province. Taigu values business, and the commercial forces are all over the world. During the early years when Kong was committed to the revolution, he also engaged in business according to the local customs, and the scope was very wide. In recent years, because he has been serving in the central government, he cannot take care of it. All the firm has been responsible for managing it. The firm established by Kong in Yuci County is called Jin Feng Hou. This firm annually manages sugar, and the wholesale quantity is huge.</p>
<p>Old Stored Sugar, Fabricated Accusations</p>
<p>According to past practice, the goods are imported at the end of the year and transported to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in the spring and summer of the following year. This spring, the red bandits disturbed Shanxi Province, and the local area was unstable, so most of the sugar was old stocks, which had already been registered by the local chamber of commerce and transferred to the county government and court. Since the smuggling craze started, the customs has implemented anti-smuggling regulations. The informer can get huge bonuses for reporting smuggled goods. Therefore, the sugar stored in Jin Feng Hou has attracted the attention of the wicked, who think it is profitable. They fabricated the term smuggled goods and reported it to the Zhengtailu Police Bureau. The police sent the police to seize more than 2,000 pieces of sugar stored in the store as smuggled goods. It has now been handed over to the court for handling.</p>
<p>Wild Ideas, Letter Extorted Kong</p>
<p>After the news of the case reached the province, it happened that Yan Jieru, a fellow villager, was looking for work in the province. It had been several months since he had accumulated huge expenses for lodging and meals. He had a wild idea and sent a letter to Minister Kong, claiming that he knew a news reporter Liu Mou and learned that the Zhengtailu Bureau recently seized more than 2,000 pieces of smuggled sugar in Yuci, involving the Jin Feng Hou firm operated by Kong. The firm had been asking Minister Kong to intercede, and it was heard that the Shanxi Provincial authorities agreed to find a way to eliminate it secretly. It also said that Liu Mou intended to disclose this situation and had tried to prevent it. He asked how to deal with it. The implication was that he wanted to take this opportunity to extort Minister Kong, so as to solve his predicament in the province.</p>
<p>Kong Shixiang, Zhao Daiwen Fairly Investigate the Matter</p>
<p>It is reported that Minister Kong was shocked after receiving Yan's letter. Since he was far away in Beijing and Shanghai, he had no way of knowing the contents of the case. Even the Jin Feng Hou firm had never cleared customs, let alone intercede. He telegraphed Chairman Zhao of Shanxi Province, asking him to investigate thoroughly, and that if the firm had illegally transported goods, it should be investigated according to law. I will never defend him. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Zhao replied to Kong, saying that the case of the smuggled sugar seized in Yuci County had been handed over to the court for handling. The manager of Jin Feng Hou had not asked the provincial government to exempt him from investigation, and the provincial government had not tried to eliminate it secretly. Later, he received a telegram from Kong, saying that if it was found that there were illegal circumstances after the investigation, please handle it strictly in accordance with the law, and should not be lenient because the firm was operated by him. Now it is reported that Chairman Zhao deeply admired Minister Kong's selfless spirit and has informed the court to handle this case carefully and not to wrong or let go. It is not difficult to find out the truth. At the same time, Yan Jieru, who sent a letter to Kong to extort him, has also been summoned for handling. As for the reporter Liu mentioned by Yan, he has also been found to be non-existent. His intention to coerce and extort is more proof.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Slum Dwellers' United Association believes that the slum dwellers under its jurisdiction are all healthy citizens and should participate in citizen registration. The association sent representatives to the First Special District Citizens' United Association to negotiate participation methods.

<h3>The Four British Giant Ships Are Rumored to Be Purchased by Japanese Merchants; The Shipping Association Believes That They Are Purchased by Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Chinese merchants purchasing four giant ships from the British White Lott Company for 2 million yuan in national currency, a reporter from Xin Sheng She inquired with the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association. According to the statement, Shanghai is an important commercial port in China. All Chinese shipping companies have their headquarters in Shanghai, and those located in other ports have branch offices or agencies in Shanghai. Moreover, most Chinese shipping companies, except for the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, are members of the association. After sending personnel to investigate, it has not been confirmed that they were purchased by Chinese merchants. Moreover, the four giant ships of White Lott Company, such as Baila Kangmai, have been in the UK and have never sailed to China. At the same time, members have also been asking the association about the truth. However, the general speculation among shipping companies is that they may be purchased by Japanese merchants. Because the Japanese government encourages shipbuilding policies and tries to restrict the purchase of old ships, Japanese merchants avoid the government's attention by purchasing in the name of Chinese merchants.</p>

<h3>Amidst News of New Cotton Hitting the Market, Japanese Factories Send Personnel to the Countryside to Purchase; 44 Japanese Factories in China Have a Total of 1.9 Million Spindles</h3>
<p>A Hua Dong News Agency report states that the first estimate for this year's new cotton crop is over 16 million dan (a unit of weight), a one-third increase compared to last year's bumper harvest. As news of the new cotton crop hitting the market spreads, Japanese yarn factories in China are following the old tricks of the Japanese grain industry, sending personnel to the countryside to purchase cotton. It is reported that there are now 44 Japanese yarn factories throughout China. Due to the advantageous situation of operating continuously throughout the year, their production volume from the current 1,944,504 spindles is already comparable to that of domestic factories. Therefore, they are even more actively purchasing raw cotton.</p>
<p>Purchasing This Year's New Cotton in the Countryside</p>
<p>This year's new cotton, excluding the Yuyao cotton which has already hit the market, will have samples of the Lingbin cotton available around the seventh lunar month. In addition to the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong, which have already been forcibly annexed by Japanese yarn factories in China, the 30 Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai have also sent personnel to cotton-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to encourage local cotton merchants to purchase cotton. The prices they offer are higher than the general selling prices. It is rumored that they plan to purchase one million dan of cotton this year.</p>
<p>44 Japanese Factories Throughout China</p>
<p>Currently, there are 44 Japanese yarn factories within China. A. Within Shanghai: 1. Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd. (5 factories), 2. Nichi-Ka (China-Japan) Textile Co., Ltd. (8 factories), 3. Naigaiwata (Inland and Overseas Cotton) Co., Ltd. (9 factories), 4. Tong Hwa (East China) Textile Co., Ltd. (1 factory), 5. Toa (East Asia) Textile Co., Ltd. (2 factories), Gongda (Public and Great) (2 factories), Datong Yarn Factory, Toyota Textile Factory, and Yufeng Textile Co., Ltd., totaling 30 factories. In Qingdao: Naigaiwata Yarn Factory, Fuji Yarn Factory, Gongda No. 5 Factory, Longxing Yarn Factory, Baolai Yarn Factory, Dakang Yarn Factory, Shanghai Textile Qingdao Factory, Toa Textile Qingdao Factory, and Toyota Qingdao Factory, totaling 10 factories. Also, Wuhan Taian Textile Co., Ltd., Naigaiwata Co., Ltd., and Dalian Futian Yarn Factory, making a total of 44 factories.</p>
<p>Rapid Increase in Spindles to Compete with Us</p>
<p>The 44 Japanese yarn factories in China now have 1,944,504 spindles. They plan to add another 20,720 spindles, 340,356 thread spindles, 23,127 looms, and plan to add 1,152 looms. They have 88,828 kilowatts of electric power, 14,025 horsepower of steam power, 68,683 workers, use 3,405,408 dan of cotton, produce 546,797 bales of yarn, and 633,861,000 square yards of cloth. Due to the fact that one-fourth of our country's 2,850,745 spindles are idle, Japanese yarn is already able to compete with us.</p>
<h3>Banking and Money Industries Initiate the Organization of an Amateur Association; A General Membership Meeting Was Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Banking and Money Industries Amateur Association, organized by members of the banking and money industries in Shanghai, began preparations in July. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the first general membership meeting was held on the third floor of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. About 60-70 people from the banking and money industries attended. Banks such as the Bank of China, Shanghai Bank, Shanghai Municipal Bank, Yien Yieh (Salt Industry) Bank, Kincheng Bank, Continental Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank, among over 20 others, all had representatives in attendance. Xie Shuren, the initiator of the association, was nominated as the temporary chairman to report on the progress of the association's preparations and to discuss issues related to recruiting members. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. The association's declaration, charter, and list of names are published below.</p>
<p>Declaration: The Banking and Money Industries Amateur Association's First General Membership Declaration: Since we initiated the organization of the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Amateur Association and issued our opinion letter, we have immediately received enthusiastic support from colleagues in the banking and money industries, and they have offered numerous suggestions, encouraging the early establishment of this association. This enthusiasm has given us great assistance, and we must thank all of our fellow members. After more than a month of planning by the initiators and enthusiastic encouragement from the members, the preparatory meeting was finally held on the afternoon of July 26 at the YMCA auditorium. At that time, the draft charter was passed (see below), and 11 preparatory committee members were elected to begin preparing everything. All of the association's affairs are progressing actively. However, we realize that the strength of a few people is limited, and the advancement of all work, whether in terms of material or human resources, requires the support of everyone. Secondly, we also recognize that in the past, our contact with fellow members has been insufficient, and many people may not even know about this association, which has led to less enthusiastic participation, especially in the money industry. For this reason, the preparatory committee decided to establish a special recruiting committee and decided to immediately begin a recruiting campaign so that every colleague working in the banking and money industries would have the opportunity to participate. We believe that this recruiting campaign is of great significance. It is the assistant and supporter that will enable this association to be established quickly. Enthusiastic members, please do your best to promote this recruiting campaign! We welcome all colleagues in the banking and money industries to participate.</p>

<h3>Jieshun Fish Company Files Appeal; Ministry of Industry Dismisses It</h3>
<p>The Jieshun Fish Company of this city filed an appeal with the Ministry of Industry regarding the illegality of the Shanghai Fish Market regulations. The Ministry of Industry's appeal decision No. 226 is as follows: Main Text: The appeal is dismissed. Facts: The appellant, in May of this year, saw in various Shanghai daily newspapers the Ministry's announcement No. 416, stating that the Shanghai Fish Market established by the Ministry was operated according to the public-private joint operation method approved by the Central Political Conference and that the regulations of the Shanghai Fish Market Co., Ltd., a public-private joint venture, were submitted to the National Government for record after being discussed and decided by the Executive Yuan. Article 3 of the regulations states that after the market opens, no other business of the same or similar nature may be operated within the Shanghai municipal area. Article 2 of the market's operating regulations states that the types of fish traded in the fish market are stipulated as follows: (1) Marine fish, (2) Freshwater fish, (3) Dried fish, (4) Other aquatic products. The first transaction of the aforementioned fish entering Shanghai must be conducted in the fish market, etc. The appellant believed that the regulations and operating procedures were illegal and filed an appeal with the Ministry. Reason: Article 1 of the Appeal Law stipulates that people who have their rights or interests harmed by illegal or inappropriate actions by central or local government agencies may file an appeal. The appellant's intention in the appeal is that the fish market's regulations and operating procedures are illegal, requesting their revocation. This does not recognize that these regulations and operating procedures are a type of government plan for fisheries administration and do not impose any punishment on the appellant. Moreover, administrative orders are issued in order to benefit the majority of the people, and the people may not file an appeal against them. The circumstances of this case do not comply with the provisions of Article 1 of the Appeal Law. Therefore, the main text is decided according to law.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Ministry of Finance to Modify the Registration Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday to modify the deadline for registration and licensing. The original telegram stated: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: It has been found that your ministry promulgated the Measures for Registration and Licensing of Wholesale, Purchasing, Transfer, and Inspection of Various Imported Goods' Businesses and Factories, and Transportation Companies. The licensing date stipulates in Article 2 that within 20 days from the date of promulgation of the measures in the local area, an application must be submitted to the agency designated by the Ministry of Finance for registration and licensing. Since the Chamber of Commerce received Announcement No. 1521 from the Jianghai Customs, forwarding the measures, it has immediately notified all industries to comply. However, the registration deadline is only 20 days. Many of the industries with smaller wholesale, purchasing, and transfer scales have failed to pay attention and have been unable to rush to complete the procedures on time. Failure to modify the procedures will inevitably make it impossible to continue business. Furthermore, the types of imported foreign goods that should be inspected have recently been modified and increased. The relevant industries affected by the increased portion still need to apply for registration and licensing in accordance with the measures. Therefore, the deadline in Article 2 of the law does in fact need to be extended. Therefore, we are specially telegraphing your ministry to review and approve, and order the Shanghai Customs to allow modification of the procedures for industries that apply for registration and licensing after the deadline, in order to alleviate commercial difficulties, which would be in the public interest. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully."</p>

<h3>County Orders Reporting of Property Tax Reorganization</h3>
<p>The property tax in various districts of Shanghai County was ordered to be reorganized. After receiving the order, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to comply. The bureau completed the investigation. The shop property tax, originally levied at 1.5%, has now been reduced to 1%. The households throughout the county are also uniformly collected in accordance with the regulations. All shops that previously concealed property values have been thoroughly investigated and earnestly reorganized. This year's implementation of collection will allocate the increased tax revenue for public security purposes.

<p>In order to develop the export of Chinese tea, the Ministry of Industry, in addition to ordering the Shanghai and Wuhan Commodity Inspection Bureaus to conduct tea production area inspections and gradually raise inspection standards, has also consulted the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces to implement unified control of black tea transportation and sales. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. It is now known that the Ministry recently received a suggestion from the tea industry to establish a National Tea Unified Sales Bureau attached to the Agricultural Development Bureau in Shanghai and Wuhan to strictly implement unified control and directly handle transportation, in order to develop foreign trade. The Ministry has adopted this suggestion and has submitted it to the Commerce and Agriculture Departments for careful study. Once the results are obtained, the General Manager of the Agricultural Development Bureau, Chen Zhenguang, will be ordered to formulate measures and establish it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Xu Wenliang Kidnapping Case; A Record of the Interrogation of the Bandits; Two Injured Bandits Have Recovered; Rescheduled for Further Trial on September 2</h3>
<p>Xu Wenliang, the Cantonese manager of the Mei Foo Oil Company's kerosene department, was suddenly invaded by several armed bandits in his residence on YuYuan Road at around 3:00 AM on July 14. Xu was kidnapped and hidden in a bungalow at No. 1 Beihong Bridge Bank near Nanxiang, hoping to send a letter demanding a huge ransom. However, due to the lack of secrecy, Chief Detective Feng Baishun, Detectives Wang Yongjun, Sun Wenxi, and Wang Xichang, and Detectives Kong Guangxiao and Zhang Kuidong of the Chengdu Road Detective Bureau solved the case, arresting 11 male and female kidnappers and rescuing the hostage Xu Wenliang. It turned out that Wang Xichang's informant, Cao Chunbao, had participated in discussions about the kidnapping beforehand in order to report to the Detective Bureau afterward. Unfortunately, the bandit party learned of this, so when Xu Wenliang was kidnapped, Cao was taken along with him. After Xu Wenliang was kidnapped, Cao was severely injured in the eye by the bandit party using a gun butt. Cao had to go to the hospital for treatment, and the hospital reported it to the Detective Bureau. The detectives first arrested Cao and then, based on Cao's confession, successively arrested the kidnappers Lai Sheng, Zhang Heshang, Zhang Zefa, Zhang Xu, Yang Chunshan, Lu A'ge, Tang Heming, Shen Tingyan, Du Haisheng, and Chen Zhihong, totaling 11 people, and rescued the hostage. At the time, the criminal Shen Tingyan tried to escape across the bank and was shot and wounded by the detectives. Therefore, in addition to Shen and Cao Chunbao, who were left in the hospital, the remaining nine people were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now known that during the rescheduling of the case, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case found that there were still three major criminals, Wang Jinsheng, Shen A'gen, Chen Weirong (i.e., "Lame Leg A'mao"), and "Long Legs Pudong Junior," at large. It was also found that the car with the Xiang Sheng number 18532 was hired by the bandit leader Wang Jinsheng to escort two accomplices to the bandit den to serve as guards. It was further determined that the defendant Yang Chunshan had, on July 13 of this year, led a gang to rob the home of Shu Mingdong at No. 41, Lane 807, Dixiwei Road, stealing 239 yuan in banknotes. It was also found that the defendant Chen Zhihong had provided a pistol and eight bullets to accomplices for robbery. Yesterday morning, the two injured defendants had recovered and were sent to the First Special Court together. The Detective Bureau's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested that the case be rescheduled for special interrogation because the circumstances of the case were tortuous and the number of people involved was large. Judge Tan ordered all the defendants to be remanded in custody and to be interrogated again on the afternoon of September 2.</p>

<h3>Yichang Jewelry Store Defrauded of Large Diamond Ring, Obtained a 500 Yuan Draft, No Such Bank Exists for Cashing</h3>
<p>On the 20th of this month, around 2:00 PM, a customer dressed in luxurious clothing suddenly appeared at Yichang Jewelry Store, No. 19 Yuyuan Road in the city, wanting to purchase a large diamond ring. Zhao Rongshou (30 years old, from Suzhou), an employee of the store, immediately took out a solitaire diamond ring for the customer to choose from. The customer selected a solitaire diamond ring weighing about 2.12 carats, agreeing on a price of 500 yuan. Unexpectedly, the customer said that the money had to be collected in person at Yongxing Bank, No. 195 Xin Kaihe Road. Because Zhao was suffering from a foot ailment, the customer went upstairs and obtained a 500 yuan check from Geng Yu's bank and handed it to Zhao, but Zhao refused to accept it because he couldn't verify its authenticity. The customer said that Geng Yu was a large remittance bank, and he was the younger brother of the owner, named Zhang Qikun, and they could immediately go to Houma Road to cash the check. Zhao, seeing the large scale of the bank, took the check to cash it. However, after inquiring everywhere, no such bank existed, and he realized he had been deceived. He returned to Yongxing Bank, but Zhang had already fled. He inquired with the bank's cashier, Shen Fengyuan, who stated that there was no Zhang Qikun at the bank. Zhao then had to return to the store and report the situation to the Yemiao Police Station, requesting a strict investigation and arrest of the fraudulent bandits for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Held a General Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Extra Tips, Found It Difficult to Accept New Movement's Ban, Pushed Representatives to Express Hotel Industry's Plight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association held a temporary members' meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce meeting room at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of extra tips. Representatives from the City Party Headquarters, Wang Longzhang, the City Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongjun, and over 200 representatives from hotels such as Central, Nanjing, Oriental, Jue Lu, and Shenzhou attended. The presidium, Chen Wenda, Sun Qiuping, Yan Rongqing, and Zheng Zhong, seriously discussed the matter, believing that, apart from voluntary tips from customers, extra solicitation by employees should not be allowed in principle. However, they found it very difficult to accept the implementation measures, which stipulated that security deposits and tips given by customers could not be collected and turned over as aviation donations. At the same time, employees also jointly appealed. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Wenda said in his opening remarks, "I am very honored that today's temporary meeting has been convened and that representatives from higher authorities and fellow industry members have attended enthusiastically. The purpose of convening this temporary meeting is to discuss an important issue concerning the survival of our industry, which is the elimination of extra tips in various industries, as advocated by the New Life Movement Promotion Association and widely publicized in society. A draft implementation plan has already been passed. We cannot criticize the elimination of extra tips in principle, but upon examining the facts, this issue is composed of various social factors and is extremely complex. We must comprehensively consider the practical difficulties and provide remedies, otherwise it will not only be of no practical benefit but may also cause major labor-management disputes. The weakness of China's industry and commerce, the difficulty of engaging in store operations, the hardships of employees' livelihoods, and the panic caused by store closures and bankruptcies, which increase employee unemployment, are all undeniable facts. Why are there extra tips? Because there is no fixed wage, or the wage is very meager, and employees have no choice but to rely on tips from customers to supplement their income. Why is there no fixed wage? Is it because the capitalists are exploiting them for their own benefit? No, absolutely not. Judging from the current situation in the industry, I can guarantee that over 90% are losing money. What is there to benefit from? On the contrary, the lives of employees are quite stable. This is evidenced by the facts. Therefore, the survival of the capitalists is even more urgent than that of the laborers. To eliminate extra tips, employees must, of course, have wages sufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living, and the capitalists must increase huge expenditures. And the huge expenditures will inevitably have to be compensated for by increasing selling prices. However, in the current situation where the social consumption capacity is declining, we only see painful auctions and large price reductions to attract customers. To increase selling prices is tantamount to going against society. Since increasing selling prices is impossible, what methods do the capitalists have to maintain this huge burden? If the capitalists cannot maintain it and go out of business, how will the employees live? Therefore, we must find a comprehensive method that takes into account both sides based on the principle of coexistence and mutual prosperity. In fact, the industry has always automatically eliminated extra tips. If a waiter serves diligently and gains the customer's favor and is rewarded, then the industry has no way to interfere. Because extra tips are not regulated, if a waiter has any extortionate behavior, they will offend the customer, and the store's business will also be affected, so it must be strictly corrected. As for the conditions of employment for waiters, such as treatment conditions and security deposits, these are a kind of contract between employer and employee, agreed upon by both parties. Any behavior agreed upon by both parties is a legal behavior. We deeply fear that while old habits should be reformed, we should also do our best to promote the New Life Movement, but we must start from the point of coexistence, mutual prosperity, and reducing disputes. As long as the store can barely maintain the minimum level of survival, they are happy to accept it and do not hope for profits. Please everyone contribute your valuable opinions and discuss a proper solution."</p>
<p>Resolution Process</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, representatives from higher authorities gave speeches. Then, according to the meeting agenda, discussions began. For the sake of seriousness, the chairman read aloud each item of the New Life Movement Promotion Association's plan to eliminate extra tips that had been passed. Then, the attending members studied each item one by one. Finally, considering everyone's opinions, the hotel industry cannot accept using the tips voluntarily given by customers as aviation donations because it concerns the business's existence and the employees' livelihoods. It was then resolved that the executive committee should submit the meeting's opinions and the hotel industry's plight to the City Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau for review and approval. Zhang Zhizhong, Sun Qiuping, Yan Rongzhong, Yao Songping, Chen Wenda, Ding Xin, Li Wencai, Sun Wenzhao, and Zhou Boyao were elected as representatives to the New Life Movement to express the hotel industry's plight.</p>
<h3>Guard Wan Guosheng Abducted and Sold a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Wan Guosheng, 30 years old, from Sichuan, previously served as a guard in a certain institution in Sichuan. In Sichuan, he had a relationship with Lu Huiying (21 years old), also from his hometown. However, Lu had already been betrothed to someone two years ago. For long-term plans, Wan secretly fled to Shanghai with the girl last month. The money he brought had already been completely used up. Wan could not think of any other way, and he brought the girl to a certain hotel in western Shanghai, preparing to sell her. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by Lu, who reported it to the local police station. The police ordered Wan's arrest and took him to the station for questioning. Wan's statements were evasive. The bureau believed that the case involved abduction and the sale of human beings, so they prepared a document and sent it to the general bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Burglary on Glock Road</h3>
<p>No. 10 Xinmin Lane, Glock Road, French Concession, is the warehouse of Huamei Pharmacy, Fuzhou Road, Public Concession, where several employees and workers reside. Yesterday morning, when a certain Zhejiang worker went to No. 7 (also the pharmacy's warehouse) for breakfast, the chests and boxes in the room were broken into by thieves, who stole 50 yuan in banknotes and several pieces of clothing. When the worker finished breakfast and returned to work, he discovered the theft and reported it to the local police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>At No. 72, Si'an Lane, Hengfeng Road, Robbers Opened Fire to Resist Arrest, Resulting in the Capture of Two Robbers and One Handgun</h3>
<p>At 2:10 AM yesterday, four robbers speaking a Jiangbei dialect suddenly arrived at the home of Hong Daochang (56 years old, from Haizhou), a rickshaw puller who lived at No. 72, Si'an Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. One robber stood guard outside the door, while three robbers pried open the front door and entered the house. Two of the robbers each held a handgun, threatening and silencing the occupants. While they were rummaging through the boxes and chests upstairs, a worker downstairs who pulled rickshaws noticed and secretly ran out the back door to report to police officer Li Bingyu at post No. 2 of the Hengfeng Road Police Station, who reported it to the station. Police Chief Lu Pei immediately led patrol officers Huang and Hu, patrol leaders Gao Ziling, Zhang Fengtong, and Dai Jifu, detective Zhong Da, and others, a total of eleven people, each carrying box guns and handguns, to the scene. The robbers were about to flee when they were caught on the spot. Since the robber had no handgun, the patrol leaders were about to enter the homeowner's house when the robbers noticed and immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, as if facing a major enemy. The long-term police officers in the police station all heard the sound and carried firearms to help. Patrol leader Gao Ziling was the most courageous, rushing up the stairs, grabbing one robber, and seizing one handgun. The remaining two robbers were chased to the third floor of an empty room at No. 117 before escaping. Afterwards, the two robbers captured were taken to the station. The handgun was inspected and found to be a six-inch Browning, serial number 92213, with three live rounds remaining and six rounds already fired. The robber on guard was immediately interrogated and identified himself as Wu Dasi, 23 years old, from Yancheng, living in a grass shed at No. 75, Tamziwankou, Zhabei, mainly pulling a rickshaw. The day before yesterday, in a barbershop opened by Zhang Mazi in Tamziwankou, Xiao Guozi, Xiao Manzi, and others agreed to rob No. 70 Si'an Lane this morning (yesterday morning). I stood guard at the door. Ming Rongsheng took a handgun with ten bullets in it. Unexpectedly, the plan went wrong and about ten shots were fired. Ming Rongsheng confessed that he was 27 years old, from Yancheng, pulling a rickshaw, and living in a grass shed at the Xiaocaichang in Tamziwan. The day before, Xiao Guozi said that the rickshaw company at No. 72 Si'an Lane had over a hundred yuan in business and was a good target. They gathered at the barbershop opened by Zhang Mazi and set off from the barbershop at a little past one o'clock this morning (yesterday morning). The handgun was mine. I went upstairs with Xiao Manzi. I only robbed 6.2 yuan in banknotes and 400 copper coins. I don't know about the banknotes and clothes. On June 20th of this year, at 9:00 PM, I robbed Guisenji Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 1601 Jiaotong Road. On May 1st, at 8:30 PM, I robbed Taichang Southern Goods Store in Panjiwan. The police officer there was from post 45, officer number 1748. On May 11th, at about 9:00 PM, I robbed the grass shed at No. 126 behind the Nanyang Soap Factory on Zhongxing Road. After the confession was obtained, the owners of Guisenji Cigarette Paper Shop on Jiaotong Road, the owner of Taichang Southern Goods Store, and the owner of the grass shed on Zhongxing Road were immediately summoned to inquire and confirmed the information. The homeowner of the rickshaw company in Si'an Lane, Hong Daochang, reported that he was robbed of over 40 yuan in silver and banknotes and several pieces of clothing. Further investigation and arrest of the remaining accomplices are currently underway.</p>

On the 22nd of this month, the traditional sixth seven-day period after death, after Zhong prepared a meal for his sister, he was overcome with the thought that he had no one to rely on after his sister's death. Grief welled up within him, and after weeping for a while, he had a fleeting thought and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the poison took effect, and his sister's husband, Gu Yongxian, discovered him and called his brother, Zhong Junyu, to help send him to Renji Hospital. Because he had been poisoned deeply, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 10:20 AM yesterday. The hospital reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. They transferred the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy room to await inspection by the Second Special Court today.</p>

Zhang intervened, causing him to kick and injure Yang Chen, the pregnant wife of Yang Dasan, 29 years old, from Tongzhou, who lived at No. 49, Kunlin Lane, in the same neighborhood. The victim's family reported it to the French police station, who sent Chen to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Detective Le Sixiang arrested Zhang, and previously sent him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The Legal Affairs Office lawyer, Chen Men, presented the case, stating that the victim was being treated in the hospital and requesting a postponement of the investigation before filing for trial.

<h3>Our Country's World Games Football Team Draws 2-2 with Paris Red Star Team; Our Team Led 2-1 in the Second Half; Our Team's Performance Was Exceptionally Beautiful, Astonishing the Audience</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 22nd - The Chinese football team participating in the Olympic Games held a friendly match with the strong local team "Red Star" this afternoon in Saint-Ouen, a suburb. The audience was very crowded. In the first half, the Red Star team led 1-0. In the second half, the Chinese team scored two consecutive goals. The Red Star team then scored another goal, resulting in a draw. The Chinese team members were agile in offense and defense, with excellent technique, winning the admiration of the audience.</p>
<p>Konti Huacheng Cup Doubles Tournament: Carson and Squiers Win the Championship; Beat He Jialiu and Liu Jie 3-2 Yesterday; He Jialiu Failed Despite Winning Back Two Sets</p>
<p>The final of the Konti Open Tennis Huacheng Cup Doubles between He Jialiu and Liu Jie versus Carson and Squiers took place at the Konti Club court at 4 PM yesterday. The competition was fierce. In the end, the He-Liu team narrowly lost 2-3. The Carson-Squiers team was fortunate to win the championship. It is noted that Carson also won the Huacheng Cup Singles Championship. The battle is described below:</p>
<p>Carson and Squiers Win Two Consecutive Sets</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Carson served, and He took the lead bravely. However, due to a momentary lapse, the Carson-Squiers team surpassed them with a score of 2-1. But He and Liu immediately tied the score. Afterwards, there were two more ties at 3-3 and 4-4, but the Carson-Squiers team always took the lead. In the ninth and tenth games, after fierce fighting, victory belonged to Carson and Squiers. He and Liu lost the first set with a score of 4-6. In the second set, Squiers served and won the first game. Then Liu, Carson, and He also won by serving. At this time, the opportunities were equal. The He-Liu team was very confident with their shots. After a score of 2-3, the situation deteriorated rapidly, and the Carson-Squiers team won four consecutive games. He and Liu then lost the second set with a score of 2-6.</p>
<p>He and Liu Regain Momentum</p>
<p>After Carson and Squiers won two consecutive sets, the third set became a matter of life and death for the He-Liu team. In the first game, the He-Liu team proceeded smoothly and took the lead. Unexpectedly, Carson and Squiers surpassed them again with a score of 2-1. After 2-1, Carson and Squiers led 4-2, and the situation became extremely dangerous. He and Liu responded calmly, and they gradually improved. After winning three consecutive games, they took control of the overall situation with a score of 5-4. Unexpectedly, Carson and Squiers tied the score again at 5-5, and the situation transitioned through stormy seas again. Finally, He and Liu were successful in their efforts and won back the second set with a score of 7-5, offering a glimmer of hope. In the fourth set, He and Liu were even more fierce, winning the first two games. Carson and Squiers tried hard to catch up but were unable to surpass them. The overall situation was controlled by He and Liu. At 5-4, the tension was even greater. He and Liu intercepted at the net, and the drop points demonstrated ingenuity. They won the fourth set with a score of 6-4, saving the critical situation.</p>
<p>Final Credit for the Victory</p>
<p>After winning two sets, the situation became evenly matched. The last set was the deciding set and the focus of the competition for both sides. However, after forty games of fierce fighting, He and Liu were visibly exhausted. Although they still fought hard, Carson and Squiers took advantage of every key moment. After losing three consecutive games, they only managed to win back one set. But Carson and Squiers quickly made a sharp turn, suddenly leading 5-1. He and Liu's hopes were once again slim. But He and Liu were ultimately a strong team. At the critical moment of success or failure, they remained extremely calm. Indeed, they won two consecutive games, bringing the score back to 5-3. Unexpectedly, Carson served again in the ninth game, and the serves were as fast as bullets. Although He and Liu returned the ball over the net twice, their efforts ultimately failed to achieve success. In the end, Ai (He?) lost miserably with a score of 3-6, and Carson and Squiers narrowly won the Huacheng Cup Doubles Championship with a score of 3-2.</p>

<h3>Senior Baseball: China Loses to the Amateur Team Again Yesterday; China Led 3-0; Mai Lingyi Wins Again Yesterday, Maintaining Top Position</h3>
<p>The second round of the senior baseball league's second match was held yesterday, with a slight change to the original schedule. Team Mai Lingyi changed to face Team Mai Lingtian at the racecourse, and Team Yi won 12-3. Team China changed to face Team Amateur at the Shen Garden, losing 4-6. After the start of the match, China was on offense first. Lei Yang and Gan You both reached base due to an error by the opposing team's third baseman, Peel, scoring two points in succession. Then, Ruiqi's high ball was caught, and Gu Tingchang and Cao Ruikang were passed to base by the opposing shortstop, and then the pitcher sent to third base for a double play, resulting in an out. The amateur team's offense was continuously killed by our team. Both sides didn't score in the second inning. In the third inning, Lei Ying scored another point, taking a surprising 3-0 lead. The Chinese team's situation was extremely strong, with few errors, and it seemed possible to avenge their previous defeat. Unexpectedly, the amateur team scored four consecutive runs in this inning, taking the lead. In the fourth inning, our side didn't score, while the amateur team continued to benefit. Rui Kang was injured and left the field due to a mishandled catch. At this time, China originally had An Lesheng as the pitcher, and hastily returned Gan Zhen to the position, replacing the catcher with An Lesheng. The amateur team took advantage of this change to score as many as six points in one go. The Chinese team suffered this loss and then fell into a slump. In the fifth inning, the Chinese team was particularly regrettable. Lei Ying hit a second base hit, and then advanced to third base due to a shortstop error. At this time, two people had already been called out, and the overall responsibility was entrusted to Mei Guoguang. Unexpectedly, he was called out after three strikes, resulting in a complete failure. If Rui Kang had not been injured, at least one point could have been scored. The amateur team also didn't score in this inning. In the sixth inning, An Lesheng attacked and returned from second base, deliberately hesitating in the middle, showing intelligence. Afterwards, nothing was gained. The amateur team, already confident of victory, abandoned the ninth inning. Since the start of the league, five matches have been played. Mai Lingyi has been invincible, maintaining the top position. The final battle has been scheduled for this Wednesday (the 26th). The results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Japanese Basketball Team Defeats French Team 45-34</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 22nd - The Japanese basketball team participating in the Olympic Games recently held a friendly match with the French basketball team. In the first half, the Japanese team led 36-14. In the second half, they lost by one point with a score of 19-20. In the end, they still won 45-34. Overall, the Japanese team's skills were excellent, and their shooting was accurate. The match was like child's play, and they didn't fully demonstrate their strengths. As for the French team, they tried their best to respond, but due to the disparity in skills, they had to admit defeat.</p>

<h3>Fragments of World Games Track and Field Judging and Equipment</h3>
<p>—Jiang Lianggui from Berlin</p>
<p>The 11th World Games opened solemnly and enthusiastically at the National Sports Center in the suburbs of Berlin. The reporter traveled from his hometown 24,000 miles away, circling half the globe, passing through Africa and arriving in Europe to participate in the grand event. This is such a joyful thing.</p>
<p>The scale of the entire Olympic Games is magnificent, and the thoroughness of the handling is truly beyond our expectations. No matter which aspect, under any tense situation, we have never encountered any clumsy or chaotic situations. There are very few staff members, but they all make the most of their work efficiency and achieve the goal of making the best use of their talents. In terms of handling affairs, everything feels worthy of reporting, so that it can be used as a reference for sports colleagues in the hometown. But this is absolutely impossible. Now, first, based on what I saw on the first day in the track and field arena, from the perspective of the sports world, I will discuss a few small issues with my colleagues in the country.</p>
<p>High Jump</p>
<p>Passing under the bar after jumping over it does not constitute a foul. This is something that people don't pay attention to, but the reporter felt very happy after discovering it. In the past, when working in the country, many disputes arose over this matter. Many sports colleagues, when officiating track and field competitions, always had a rule saying, "Athletes in high jump and pole vault who pass over the bar and then run back under the bar will be considered a failure." In fact, this clause is not listed in the rules, but everyone almost followed it by misinterpretation. Therefore, I paid special attention to this point at this World Games. Fortunately, the first event was high jump. As a result, I found that most athletes ran back under the bar after jumping over it. The referees treated it as if there was no rule. Of course, we can trust that this was not a referee's oversight, but because there is no such clause in the rules. What I have often doubted for several years has received a satisfactory answer. At the same time, there are not a few people in the country who feel the same as the reporter. From then on, there can be a uniform method for this exceptional rule.</p>
<p>Measurement of High Jump</p>
<p>(1) The Height Increased Each Time This is also something that is not unified. At domestic sports meets, I have never heard of any regulations on the increase in high jump height. Everyone does what they want without any fixed rules. Of course, the uneven increase in height each time is definitely not beneficial to the athletes. At this World Games, the official competition's starting height was 1 meter 85, and each increase was 0.03 meters (three centimeters). I think this is a very appropriate height. In smaller sports meets, the starting height may be slightly reduced, but the increased height can be consistent. (2) Height Measurement Height measurement is a very troublesome and difficult task to achieve accurately. The method used at this conference is relatively accurate and simple, and it is also very economical and can be imitated. (This method is also used in China, but it is not very common.) The method uses a triangular wooden block, about two meters thirty long, with a wooden base. The wood is extremely strong, and the height is engraved on it, with centimeters as the unit. Each time the height is measured, you only need to place the height wood on the bar and view the height from a parallel line.</p>
<p>Javelin</p>
<p>(1) Communication of Errors The javelin throw is thrown from a long distance. At the same time, the line referee and the distance referee must communicate with each other. After each athlete throws, the line referee must inform the distance referee. If there is no appropriate signal and a megaphone is used to communicate, the referees are easily fatigued, and the audience is easily annoyed by the noisy sounds in the field. During the competition, red and white flags can be used. After the athlete throws, if he does not cross the line, raise the white flag to indicate credibility, and the measurer can measure. If he crosses the line, raise the red flag. This method not only makes it difficult for the referees to misunderstand, but also allows the entire audience to see it clearly.</p>
<p>(2) The Thrower Retrieves the Javelin Himself After the javelin is thrown, the athlete's forward trend is determined, so he runs to retrieve it himself. (The benefit of this approach is to reduce the number of people on the field, avoid danger, and allow them to know their distance. Although the method is desirable, it should not be used in situations where the scale is small, the sports meet is short, the number of people is large, and time is limited.</p>
<p>Referees</p>
<p>(1) The athletes of each event are led out of the field by the referees of each event. This is one of the things that makes me most satisfied. Every time we hold a sports meet in the country, we feel that the most difficult thing is to maintain order on the field. Every time we hold a sports meet, there are not many nominally appointed officials who leisurely walk around the field, looking around, or many retired athletes (the projects have been completed, forming groups and walking back and forth endlessly. The progress of the sports meet is affected, and the audience's line of sight is also obstructed. The method used at this conference is excellent. The athletes of each event report at the roll call point at the specified time, and the referees in charge of each event lead them into the field in a line. When the entire event is over, the referees of that event lead them out of the field in a line. Therefore, there are no idle officials watching the competition in the field, and no retired athletes running around. The order is orderly.</p>
<p>(2) Issuing Membership Clothing The issuer has the greatest impact on performance. At this World Games, the clothing issued to the issuers is different from that of general referees. They wear white coats, like doctors, which are very obvious. Athletes, spectators, and referees can all see it clearly at a glance.</p>
<p>(3) Finish Line Referee Platform The platform is different from what is seen in China. Most of what is seen in China are two meters wide, and each level can seat three people. Here, it is different. The platform is extremely narrow, and each level can only seat two people. This method is more advanced, because if three people sit on one level at the same time, only one person can get the most accurate line of sight, and the other two will have some differences. Only "people" sit on each level, so each person is in the most excellent position.</p>
<p>Distance Markers</p>
<p>Use hexagonal wooden blocks instead of small flags, because lead flags can only be seen by the audience on both sides, while hexagonal wooden blocks can be seen by the audience on all four sides.</p>
<p>Performance Report</p>
<p>(1) When the competition is in progress, for track and field events in progress, each throw is reported immediately. The method is to set up two reporting boards on the ground at each of the four corners of the field, one for the athlete's number plate and one for the performance plate. Each corner has two people handling the matter. Each corner has a telephone. Every time the athlete throws, the number is reported first, and the score is also marked immediately. The process is extremely fast, and the entire audience can know the exact distance of each athlete's throw.</p>
<p>(2) The results of track races are reported on the general reporting board after each race is completed. The scores of each person are marked.</p>
<p>Photography</p>
<p>For track races, the finish line photo is washed out within five minutes of each race. The speed of handling is extremely fast, so the photographic equipment must be as complete as possible. However, it must not obstruct the audience. The method is quite good. Obstacles are attached to the finish line, and pits are dug on the left and right sides of the track and field field, about a foot from the ground. The camera is placed in the pit. The position is good and does not obstruct the audience's line of sight.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Wins the Xian Fang Cup Championship; Runners-up Friendship Star Competes with Konti</h3>
<p>The Xian Fang Cup League, organized by the Shanghai Chinese Tennis Federation, has not yet been fully completed, but Lingnan has already scored 153 points and completed the championship. Friendship Star is the most promising runner-up. What is frightening is that Konti is watching with eager eyes, and there is a literary child behind them. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingnan Defeats Xiacun 12-3</p>
<p>Dadecheng Defeats Zhenru 15-0</p>
<p>Meilu Defeats Tongji 12-3</p>
<h3>Huazhong Games Anhui Province Prepares for Preliminary Selections</h3>
<p>Anqing, 22nd - The Anhui Provincial Preliminary Selection for the 6th Huazhong Games will be held in Anqing from September 20th to 22nd. The Education Department has appointed Inspector Luo Liangzhu as the director of the preparatory committee.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Rowing and Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>Qingdao, 22nd - A long-distance swimming and rowing competition was held in Qingdao on the 22nd. Many people participated enthusiastically. The swimming champion was Bian Leting, and the rowing champions were Zou Luri and Wang Baofa.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Cup Citywide Small Football Finals to Be Moved to City Center</h3>
<p>The citywide open small football competition initiated by Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city to promote children's sports, after being organized by the Shanghai Small Football Sports Association since spring, has achieved good results. It is reported that the founder of the association, She Weifan, submitted a report to the municipal government yesterday, reporting that the entire competition is about to end, and the champions and runners-up of each group will be determined separately. He was allowed to move the Mayor's Cup finals to the large sports field in the city center at the end of this month, as ordered. It is also said that Mayor Wu may return to Shanghai from Lushan at that time to attend the awards ceremony to show grand importance.</p>

<h3>New Disciplinary Plan at Zhengfeng Middle School</h3>
<p>Zhengfeng Middle School in Xujiahui in this city has been established for ten years. Since Wu Kaixian took over as chairman of the board and Hu Changzhi took over as principal last year, the school's operations have developed further. There are currently more than 400 students and more than 40 faculty and staff members. The facilities are well-equipped, and the academic atmosphere is excellent. Recently, Principal Hu of the school announced a new disciplinary plan for the coming year to various newspapers. The following is a selection of the original text:</p>
<p>When the school was first founded, it was a time when normal academic habits were rampant and morale was low. The school's purpose in establishing itself was to express its unique spirit and realize its unique ideals in the midst of this universally turbulent and evil trend. The reason why the two characters "Zhengfeng" (正風, meaning "correcting the wind") were adopted as the school's name is for this reason. However, since the school was founded ten years ago, the ills of society have remained, and the effectiveness of running the school has not been evident. Although the comrades who run the school and the students of the school can frequently sound the morning rooster in a common environment of study and mutual encouragement, but as the saying goes, "the Way is one foot high, but the demons are ten feet high." The efforts of individuals ultimately cannot withstand the changes in society. The fact that the spirit of our school has failed to attract social attention is also a major reason. For a year now, the school has faced this problem, studied it in depth, and invited teachers from all levels of the school, as well as educational experts from various places, to provide opinions and jointly review them. Combining public opinion, it is generally believed that the power of society is indeed great, but the school's failure to cultivate students to perfection is still one of the reasons. From the school's point of view, it is still necessary to put in a lot of effort in this regard. The school is built on its words, and it has been decided that from the next semester onwards, a Student Life Guidance Committee will be established in the school's administrative system, alongside the Dean of Students' Office, to jointly assume full responsibility for the school's disciplinary education. In general, the mission of the Dean of Students' Office belongs to the negative aspect, and the mission of the Student Life Guidance Committee belongs to the positive aspect. In other words, the two institutions of the Dean of Students' Office and the Student Life Guidance Committee will implement a kind of rigid control method over all aspects of student life. The scientific basis for this kind of life control lies in basing it on the research results of physiology and psychology, and making a reasonable allocation of students' daily life, such as the length of reading time, the amount of sleep and rest, and the proportion of games and homework. With this method, students can abide by discipline and regulations in their school life, and perhaps in the future, after leaving school, they can use their learning to correct society. The spirit of the school can be carried forward and developed. At the beginning of this implementation, we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will give us serious criticism and reasonable guidance.</p>

<h3>A Humble Proposal for Reforming the Currency System of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Xu Deguang</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The currency system of Guangdong Province has always been extremely complex and chaotic. Recently, due to the military's habit of using 20-cent subsidiary coins and subsidiary dollar notes as a medium of exchange, endless financial disputes have arisen. This is because the subsidiary dollar has not gained a position in foreign exchange, and its price often fluctuates. All market transactions use Hong Kong banknotes as the standard of payment, which makes the credibility of the Hong Kong dollar stronger and the foundation of the subsidiary dollar weaker. Changes in its price often affect industry, commerce, and all trades, and even involve the rural economy. Anyone familiar with the situation in Guangdong Province knows that the Hong Kong dollar actually controls the economic lifeline of the entire province. Even in normal times, Guangdong Province urgently needed to reform to a silver dollar standard. Since the central government implemented the legal tender policy last year, the Guangdong provincial authorities have taken the opportunity to issue banknotes arbitrarily. Initially, in November of last year, the Finance Department issued an order to centralize silver, stipulating that one silver subsidiary dollar would be exchanged for 1.2 subsidiary dollar notes, and one silver dollar would be exchanged for 1.44 subsidiary dollar notes, in an attempt to absorb a large amount of silver and make up for the emptiness of the treasury. At that time, the Finance Department's accumulated expenses were all paid in banknotes. After the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, military expenditures inflated, and the number of banknotes issued arbitrarily was even more difficult to estimate. The price of banknotes plummeted, and the market panicked. All silver, except for that held by the Preparatory Custody Committee, was either hidden among the people or escaped to Hong Kong, almost creating an irreparable chaos. This is another reason why the Guangdong provincial banknotes urgently need to be reformed to a silver dollar standard due to the current pressing needs.</p>
<p>(2) The Problem of Reform</p>
<p>The central government's current reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province is based on the main principles of safeguarding the legal interests of the people of Guangdong Province and avoiding excessive burdens on the government. Therefore, we must first consider all aspects, adopt a gradual approach, and strive to achieve the goals of stabilizing finances and unifying the currency system within a certain period of time. The following points should be noted when drafting the plan:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of the amount of new legal tender to be issued.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of the exchange rate between the new legal tender and the subsidiary dollar notes.</p>
<p>(3) The relationship between creditors and debtors.</p>
<p>(3) The Reform Plan</p>
<p>There is no accurate public announcement of the amount of banknotes issued in Guangdong Province and its silver reserves. According to records, the total amount issued is 250 million yuan, and the cash reserve is equivalent to 10.7 million subsidiary dollars. The guarantee reserve includes more than 92 million yuan of provincial treasury bonds, but these treasury bonds currently have no market price or credibility, so it is difficult to consider them as reliable. Therefore, the first step of the reform plan must be to thoroughly examine the nature of the reserve and the amount of issuance as the criteria for determining the amount of new currency to be issued. However, referring to various records, the amount of banknotes issued in Guangdong Province is not far from the above number. Let us assume this number as the standard for formulating the reform plan.</p>
<p>(A) First-Step Plan</p>
<p>(1) Establish a Guangdong branch of the Central Bank to issue 120 million yuan of legal tender. The existing silver in Guangdong Province is worth a total of 10.7 million subsidiary dollars. Calculated at a discount of 20% to silver dollars (subsidiary dollars in Guangdong Province are complex and of varying fineness. If we calculate their pure silver content in terms of silver dollars, it would be difficult. Therefore, we propose to follow the market price of 12 subsidiary dollars in Shanghai being equivalent to one silver dollar), it is worth approximately 8.91 million yuan. Now we propose to issue 120 million yuan of legal tender in the first step. The cash reserve has reached more than 70%. The remaining 30% of the guarantee reserve can be supplemented with central government bonds. In this way, the foundation can be considered solid, and credibility will inevitably increase day by day.</p>
<p>(2) Stipulate that one silver dollar legal tender is equivalent to 1.6 subsidiary dollar notes, and gradually withdraw 192 million yuan of subsidiary dollar notes. The total amount of subsidiary dollar notes issued in Guangdong Province is 225 million yuan, and the cash reserve is approximately 10.7 million yuan. One subsidiary dollar note is only worth about 43% of its original silver content. If calculated at a 20% discount, it is only equivalent to 16% of a silver dollar. Now, at the rate of 1.6 yuan for one silver dollar legal tender, one subsidiary dollar note is equal to 63% of a silver dollar, which is 75% higher than the original stipulated price.</p>
<p>However, some may think that the 60% rate is too high, and the people of Guangdong Province will suffer excessive losses. It is not known that since the Finance Department promulgated the decree to purchase silver, the value of subsidiary dollar notes has fallen to 12% of its original value, which is approximately equal to 82% of a subsidiary dollar. At a 20% discount, it is only equal to 69.44% of a silver dollar. The proposed exchange rate between subsidiary dollar notes and silver dollar legal tender is 16 to 10, meaning one subsidiary dollar note is equivalent to 62.5% of a silver dollar. The actual price of subsidiary dollar notes after the reform is equal to 90% of the pre-reform price.</p>
<p>In fact, there is little difference. Given the disorder of the Guangdong provincial banknotes, and after the reform, such a result can be achieved, the people of Guangdong Province will be overjoyed even if they lose 10%, and they would not dare to disagree.</p>
<p>Some say that the exchange rate between subsidiary dollars and silver dollars in Guangdong Province is often around 30%, and the exchange rate for this reform should also be set at 20% to be fair. It is not known that the exchange rate between subsidiary dollars and silver dollars in Guangdong Province has often been between 35% and 40% in recent years. Even before this change in Guangdong Province, it often fluctuated between 28% and 41%. Now, let us assume it is 38%. Compared with the new currency system's 60%, the price is only 13.75% lower than the original. The calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Conversely, if the ratio of subsidiary dollar notes to silver dollars is set at 3 to 10, the price of subsidiary dollar notes will be higher after the reform than before. This is not only unreasonable, but also enough to give speculators the opportunity to manipulate the market, and the central government would bear a heavy burden. Who would believe that this is a good plan?</p>
<p>In summary, if subsidiary dollar notes are gradually withdrawn at a rate of 60%, the losses of the people of Guangdong Province will not be excessive, and the central government will also be able to handle it with ease. This is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(3) Stipulate the method of repaying debts with legal tender. Before the implementation of legal tender in Guangdong Province, subsidiary dollars and subsidiary dollar notes circulated equally. When the local authorities used the name of legal tender to engage in expansion, they stipulated that one subsidiary dollar was worth 1.2 subsidiary dollar legal tender notes. Therefore, a difference in price arose between subsidiary dollars and subsidiary dollar notes. On the one hand, the government used this method to absorb silver, and on the other hand, it stipulated that debtors could repay debts at face value with legal tender. The method was fundamentally contradictory. However, at that time, the government was eager to collect silver and had to use the premium method. On the other hand, because the price of legal tender and silver coins has always been equal, forcing debtors to pay an additional 20% would cause additional losses and inevitably lead to disputes. Conversely, when creditors lent money, except for a few exceptions, they all received and paid out in subsidiary dollar notes. Therefore, there were no losses on either side. However, the central government's current reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province is very different from that time. In recent months, the arbitrary issuance of subsidiary dollar notes has become more severe, and their purchasing power is vastly different from that before November of last year. After the new legal tender is issued, both subsidiary dollar notes and subsidiary dollars will be a kind of goods other than currency, and the prices must be differentiated to distinguish between different grades. By the same token, debts that occurred before November 3rd of last year cannot be compared with those that occurred after that date. Therefore, after the new currency system is implemented in Guangdong Province, at least the following four methods should be stipulated for repaying debts with legal tender:</p>
<p>(1) From the date of implementation of the new currency system, all company transactions, deposits, loans, tax payments, and debt repayments should be conducted in silver dollar legal tender.</p>
<p>(2) For all public and private debts that occurred before November 3, 1935, and whose contracts or regulations specify that they should be paid in silver subsidiary coins (i.e., subsidiary dollars): when repaid in silver dollar legal tender, the exchange rate should be set at one silver dollar legal tender being equivalent to 1.44 silver subsidiary dollars.</p>
<p>(3) For all public and private debts that occurred from November 3, 1935, and whose contracts or regulations specify that they should be paid in subsidiary dollar legal tender or have no stipulation, when repaid in silver dollar legal tender, the exchange rate should be set at one silver dollar legal tender being equivalent to 1.6 subsidiary dollar legal tender.</p>
<p>(4) For all public and private debts arising from lease, mandate, or employment relationships, unless otherwise agreed by both parties, regardless of whether the debt is continuing, the date of the contract shall be the date of occurrence of the debt.</p>
<p>(B) Second-Step Plan</p>
<p>(1) Issue 40 million yuan of Guangdong financial treasury bonds to absorb as many subsidiary dollar notes as possible. The amount of subsidiary dollar banknotes issued in Guangdong Province is 250 million yuan. In addition to the 192 million yuan exchanged for silver dollar legal tender, there are still 58 million yuan left. It is proposed to issue 40 million silver dollars of Guangdong financial treasury bonds to gradually withdraw the remaining notes at a rate of 60%. It is estimated that after deducting handling fees and discounts, 60 million yuan of subsidiary dollar notes can be absorbed. At this point, all subsidiary dollar notes will be eliminated, and the currency system will return to unity.</p>
<p>(2) Continue to issue 10 million yuan of silver dollars to purchase silver from the people. Six months after the new currency system is implemented, if the foundation has been stabilized, the issuance of legal tender can be continued with 30 million yuan to purchase silver from the people. It is estimated that there are still tens of millions of yuan of silver in the rural areas and major cities of Guangdong Province. If the issuance of legal tender continues, it can be absorbed as much as possible. The exchange rate can be set at one yuan of legal tender being equivalent to 1.2 yuan of silver subsidiary coins. After the silver is centralized, it will be used entirely as a legal tender reserve, and the credibility of the legal tender will become more consolidated.</p>
<p>(4) The Impact of the New Currency System on Various Aspects</p>
<p>(1) The Impact on Foreign Exchange: After the implementation of the new currency system, the national currency system will be unified, and the effectiveness of the legal tender policy will be able to be demonstrated in Guangdong Province at the same time. The foreign exchange rate in Guangdong Province will inevitably become more stable, unlike the erratic fluctuations of the past. The influence of Hong Kong banknotes will also gradually decrease, which is beyond doubt. Since the central government implemented the legal tender policy, the exchange rate between legal tender and Hong Kong dollars has often been around 91.5. In recent years, the exchange rate between subsidiary dollar notes and Hong Kong dollars in Guangdong Province, except for abnormal cases, has also often fluctuated between 15% and 50%. There is a great difference between them, and the risks borne by industrial and commercial operators are profound. After the reform, due to the stability of foreign exchange, Guangdong merchants will not only be able to avoid dangerous burdens, but also be able to directly purchase foreign exchange, eliminate the exploitation of foreign trading companies, and reduce various losses in exchange. This is all beneficial and without any harm.</p>
<p>(2) The Impact on Prices: After the implementation of the new currency system, once the foreign exchange rate is stable, the prices of foreign goods will inevitably become more stable, and the prices of local goods will increase due to the convenience of transportation between the north and the south, and the unification of the currency system, which makes circulation easier. As for the rise and fall of prices, there will be slight changes in the month or two before and after the reform, but after a certain period of time, they will inevitably return to normal. Now let's try an example to illustrate it. For example: Item A is produced in Shanghai, and Item B is produced in Guangzhou. The price of both items in Shanghai is one silver dollar, and the price of both items in Guangzhou is 1.4 subsidiary dollars. After the reform in Guangdong Province, the prices of both items in Guangzhou will rise to one silver dollar, equivalent to 1.6 subsidiary dollar notes. At first glance, prices seem to have risen, but in fact, the exchange ratio of the two items is still one to one, and merchants in Guangdong and Shanghai will not suffer any losses. However, general consumers (actually subsidiary dollar note holders) will inevitably lose 10% when they exchange 1.6 subsidiary dollar notes for one silver dollar legal tender. In fact, this kind of loss will ultimately be borne by the subsidiary dollar note holders, and has nothing to do with consumers. For those who rely on salaries, remuneration, and other income for their livelihoods, although the amount of their income is obviously different from before, their standard of living will remain unchanged, which is self-evident.</p>
<p>(3) The Impact on Industry, Commerce, and Finance: After the implementation of the new currency system, prices in Guangdong Province will gradually stabilize, and the foreign exchange rate will also tend to be stable. It will break the previously chaotic and irrecoverable situation, eliminate the risks of foreign trade, and investors will inevitably be enthusiastic. Financial activities and credit will develop, and industry and commerce will become increasingly prosperous. Tax revenues will become more abundant, and taxes will naturally increase. Moreover, the exhaustion of financial resources in Guangdong Province and the complexity of the currency system are actually one of the main reasons. After this reform, once the currency system is unified, it can reduce various losses in exchange and various twists and turns in revenue and expenditure. Revenue will not be reduced, and the government will be able to obtain endless convenience in financial administration.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the current reform of the currency system in Guangdong Province is aimed at stabilizing prices, balancing foreign exchange, unifying the currency system, and regulating finance, which is a pressing need at present. As for the reform methods, the only principles should be to protect the legal interests of the people and reduce the government's burden. On the one hand, a reasonable amount of legal tender should be issued to meet current needs and gradually abolish subsidiary dollars. On the other hand, an appropriate exchange rate between subsidiary dollars and legal tender should be set to facilitate industrial and commercial transactions and resolve debt disputes. Finally, silver should be centralized as much as possible to completely eliminate subsidiary dollar notes and complete the unified legal tender policy of the country. These are just the broad outlines of the reform plan. As for the precise numbers and detailed methods, they can only be discussed after a considerable period of investigation and research.</p>

<h3>The Key to Reorganizing Guangdong Currency</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>As the economy develops and commerce becomes more frequent, the need for stable money becomes increasingly urgent. This is because currency serves as a measure of value, and commercial transactions are merely transfers of value. However, the concept of "currency stability" evolves with the times. In the past, during the era of the free gold standard, it was generally believed that maintaining the weight and fineness of the currency metal was the key to currency stability. Before and after the European War, various countries issued banknotes excessively and without limit, leading to the advocacy of the reserve stabilization theory. At that time, exchange rates fluctuated greatly, and some scholars confused the stability of exchange rates with currency stability. The most advanced proponent of currency stability was Mr. Irving Fisher of the United States, who advocated that currency stability should be based on price stability, which has a significant and profound impact on the national economy. As for the fixed weight and fineness of currency metals and the stability of reserves, under the managed inconvertible paper standard, they have no foreign exchange significance; if they do, it is only a matter of psychological factors. If Gustav Cassel's purchasing power parity theory of currency is not flawed, then the exchange rate is merely a reflection of prices between two or more countries. Therefore, seeking exchange rate stability without price stability is like climbing a tree to catch fish and is certainly unattainable. Conversely, if prices are stable among all economic entities, then exchange rate stability will naturally follow.</p>
<p>When we study the issue of reorganizing the Guangdong currency system, we must also start from this point. Otherwise, a difference of a hair's breadth can lead to an error of a thousand miles, and the problem will be difficult to resolve correctly. Unifying issuance, establishing a Guangzhou branch of the central bank, and centralizing reserves are all technical issues that are not difficult to implement. The biggest difficulty today is the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency, which requires theoretical exploration and practical alignment. Therefore, I will study the recent opinions of various experts and briefly express my own views for the reference of those in charge.</p>
<p>(1) Exchange Rate Dumping Theory</p>
<p>Here, I would like to first study Mr. Huang Yuanbin's theory, as Mr. Huang advocates for "currency stability." Mr. Huang strongly criticizes the stability of currency weight and fineness, as well as the stability of reserves, and his focus seems to be directly on the exchange rate. Regarding the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency, he advocates that "the best rate is the average rate of the one or two weeks before implementation, fixed at a point between plus five and plus six." This argument is not without its flaws. Short-term fluctuations should only be regarded as abnormal changes. For example, last year, the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency once rose to 90% or parity, while recently it has fallen to plus five or plus six, both of which are speculative phenomena. Mr. Huang's preference for plus five and plus six over 90% or parity is said to be due to a focus on the economic welfare of the people of Guangdong. He specifically pointed out: "From the perspective of production, trade, overseas remittances, and agriculture, industry, and commerce, the fixed rate should be low." This statement is rather vague. Upon closer examination, China's production industries rely heavily on the import of foreign machinery and raw materials, and a low exchange rate will increase production costs, which may not be competitive with imported goods. In terms of trade, suppressing the value of exports and encouraging imports may not be beneficial, and only extreme national economic theorists can deny this. The same reasoning can be applied to other aspects, which I will not elaborate on. In my opinion, Professor Huang's greatest theoretical errors are: (1) confusing the devaluation of Guangdong currency with the devaluation of national currency; (2) neglecting the price balance between Guangdong Province and other provinces. Because of the first error, Mr. Huang believes that the depreciation of Guangdong currency is equivalent to the depreciation of national currency, thus reaping the benefits of currency devaluation and dumping. This is the core of Mr. Huang's theory, which I therefore call the exchange rate dumping theory. However, we must understand that the devaluation of Guangdong currency does not necessarily achieve the effect of devaluation, but rather suffers the harm of devaluation first. Why? The implementation of the devaluation of Guangdong currency is aimed at the domestic market. After the devaluation, it will join the "National Currency Bloc (Chinese Dollar Bloc)." Whether the Guangdong economy can benefit from the devaluation depends on the direction of the national currency. If the national currency maintains its current exchange rate, then Guangdong Province will not gain any benefit. Conversely, if the Guangdong currency is fixed at plus two or three or even half, then it will join the "National Currency Group." If the national currency adopts a policy of devaluation (such as maintaining it at one shilling), then Guangdong Province can also benefit from the low currency value, like other provinces. In terms of currency flow, if the exchange rate is fixed at plus six (i.e., 60 cents of Guangdong currency equals one yuan of national currency), which is plus four compared to the normal period of plus two, then the property and income of the people of Guangdong will be reduced by one-quarter, and government tax revenue will also decrease by the same amount. Suffering harm before gaining benefit, is this not the case? Although Mr. Huang mentioned the trend of currency devaluation in various countries after the European War in his article, he does not know that this is only a means of exchange rate war between countries. Now, the issue of the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency is aimed at the domestic market. Does Mr. Huang still not understand the severity of the chaos in domestic exchange rates and want to start an exchange rate war between domestic provinces? Furthermore, even the United Kingdom, which holds the reins of global finance after the European War, implemented a revaluation policy to restore the exchange rate to its former level, focusing on stabilizing domestic prices. At the same time, France, which devalued its currency by half, is still terrified today, and this lesson can be learned. Moreover, if the Guangdong currency is devalued today, and the national currency is devalued again in the future, the people of Guangdong will suffer double losses and their resentment will deepen. Mr. Huang's other error is neglecting the price balance between domestic provinces. Taking Shanghai and Guangdong as an example, the wholesale price index in Guangzhou in 1922 was 104, while in Shanghai it was 102. In November 1924 (the month the new currency policy was implemented), the price index in Guangzhou fell to 92.3, while the price index in Shanghai rose to 98.27, and in March it rose to 99.41. From this, it can be seen that the price index in Guangzhou is gradually balancing with Shanghai. Once the Guangdong currency is devalued by another 25%, as Mr. Huang advocates, then prices in Guangdong will be so cheap that they can be dumped to other provinces, disrupting the domestic economic balance. Mr. Huang is so addicted to the poison of exchange rate dumping that he cannot extricate himself.</p>
<p>(2) Reserve Stabilization Theory</p>
<p>This is the opinion of the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Economic Society and its president, Mr. Li Zongtai. This school focuses on the solidity of reserves and bonds after the reform, which seems even more backward than the exchange rate dumping theory. Mr. Li and others argue that the current amount of paper currency in circulation in Guangdong Province is 249,212,062.50 yuan, and there is 10,745,000 yuan in silver (including 19,550,000 yuan in big dollars and 83,990,000 yuan in small dollars), totaling 67 million ounces of pure silver. If this silver is sold in New York at a price of 50 to 60 cents per ounce, it can be exchanged for 10 million US dollars, which is 12 million yuan in national currency. With this silver, another 10 million yuan in public bonds can be issued, which can issue 100 million yuan in national currency notes, meeting the regulation of four silver reserves to one note. Adding 30% to the 200 million yuan in national currency (which is Mr. Li's proposal), it can recover 250 million yuan in old currency, and the amount is not much different. Mr. Li also pointed out that issuing 80 million yuan in public bonds is easy, and there is no problem in terms of guarantee and acceptance. However, according to my observation, even if Mr. Li's method is used, calculated at a ratio of plus three, the current reserve is still insufficient by about 4 million yuan, which needs to be raised by those in charge, this is one point. I have no objection to issuing public bonds. However, in my humble opinion, even if the guarantee and acceptance aspects are not a problem, the payment of interest and principal must be carefully considered. If public bonds are used for productive enterprises, the burden of repaying principal and paying interest will fall on those enterprises. If public bonds are used for reorganizing finance, the burden will fall on the people, which is equivalent to increasing people's taxes. Moreover, since the government has already issued many public bonds, it can obtain sufficient public bonds for collateral by mortgaging those bonds, without the need to issue new bonds, this is the second point. The above is purely from a technical point of view. From a theoretical point of view, since the implementation of the new currency policy in November last year, China has actually adopted a managed currency standard. Issuing banknotes does not require strict adherence to the theory of "currency doctrine." The so-called currency doctrine believes that the amount of currency in circulation in a society must be restricted and advocates strict adherence to a fixed reserve as the basis. The promulgation of the British Peel's Act in 1844 was the first sign of victory for this theory. Later, various countries followed suit, and vulgar monetary scholars regarded it as the supreme principle. However, the evolution of monetary theory to this day has denied this theory as self-evident, and the theory of managed currency has taken its place. Proponents of managed currency advocate controlling the quantity and velocity of currency circulation so that it maintains a balance with the volume of commercial transactions, thereby stabilizing prices. Now that the country has adopted a managed currency system, there is no need to rigidly demand the certainty of reserves, but only to pay attention to the stability of prices. According to the estimates of the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, in the past sixty years, about 300 million yuan of silver has flowed into Guangdong Province. Since Guangdong implemented the policy of buying silver, it has only bought more than 80 million small dollars and more than 19 million big dollars, with more than 180 million yuan still hidden among the people. If our government implements the policy of nationalizing silver again, and can buy 180 million yuan, then it can continue to issue 200 million yuan of banknotes. If the government adopts this policy, then Guangdong paper currency will suddenly increase to more than 100%, which is a cause for concern. On the other hand, it is not easy to raise silver from the people, and the existing silver reserves are flowing out to compensate for overspending, thereby affecting the contraction of currency, which is also a cause for concern. It is believed that the note issuance reserve is only a psychological factor, like the window dressing of banks, which can be temporarily dealt with and should not be overemphasized. If we still adhere to the old concept and use the amount of reserves as the basis for note issuance, then it will not be successful and will lead to currency instability, as mentioned above, which is not the original intention of reserve stabilization.</p>
<p>(3) Raising Parity Theory</p>
<p>This is advocated by various industry associations in Guangzhou, and although the theory superficially advocates half exchange, its real purpose is to raise the value of Guangdong currency. The reason is roughly: "Although the announcement of buying silver at plus one was made last year, in fact, all merchants and people in the province, whether depositing money or transacting money, are returning to a certain amount of legal tender according to the original number of silver dollars. This amount is more than several times higher than the government's buying and selling. It can be seen that the merchants and people did not all get the benefit of exchanging legal tender at plus two. Now, if the legal tender obtained by exchanging silver dollars at parity must be exchanged for foreign dollars at a higher price, wouldn't it increase the people's losses?" -- Guangzhou Min Guor Daily, August 11, declaration by the City Chamber of Commerce. Here, the exchange rate issue can be divided into two discussions, one is the exchange rate between national currency and Guangdong banknotes, and the other is the exchange rate between Guangdong legal tender and Guangdong silver dollars. This article focuses on the issue of the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency, because Guangdong legal tender and Guangdong silver dollars should be exchanged at parity, the reason is obvious, as mentioned above. As for those who advocate different exchange rates between national currency and Guangdong legal tender and Guangdong silver dollars (such as Li Yin'nan, see Bank Weekly, Volume 20, Issue 20), they only get the appearance and do not know the reality. However, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce's theory can be used to explain that Guangdong legal tender and Guangdong silver dollars should be exchanged at parity, but not to explain that Guangdong legal tender and national currency should be exchanged at parity. Why? Because the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency, in its normal state, originally revolved around plus two, and the parity theory advocates abolishing this plus two, which is equivalent to raising the value of Guangdong currency by 20%. The advantages and disadvantages of this theory are exactly the opposite of the exchange rate dumping theory. Although the nominal income of the people of Guangdong will increase as a result, and the national tax revenue will also benefit, industry and commerce will inevitably suffer from the harm of expensive currency. To put it more bluntly, those who advocate raising the currency value have not considered the risk of the collapse of the Guangdong economy.</p>
<p>The above three theories are inevitably biased and do not focus on managing currency and stabilizing currency. They only focus on the exchange rate issue, but if this issue is left to individual subjective judgment, it will not be easy to determine. For example, Mr. Huang Yuanbin, the director of the Department of Economics at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, has repeatedly changed his exchange rate proposals, sometimes advocating plus four and sometimes advocating plus five. There are even those who advocate using the old ratio of buying big dollars in Guangdong Province, plus 4.4, as the standard, boasting that it is based on facts, but in terms of reasoning, it is completely unfounded. Mr. Li Taichu's ratio of plus three, although similar to the arguments of those who advocate currency stabilization, is based on a wrong starting point. The parity theory also has considerable reasons, but it is regrettable to confuse the exchange of silver dollars with Guangdong banknotes at parity and the exchange of silver dollars with national currency at half. There are even those who advocate reorganizing the Guangdong currency system using the old method of reorganizing Sichuan paper currency, which is also due to a lack of understanding of the financial situation in Guangdong Province. At that time, the Sichuan issuance system had not yet been unified, so the central government promoted central paper currency in Sichuan Province, allowing it to form its own exchange rate, and gradually recovered the old Sichuan currency, avoiding the trouble of considering the exchange rates of various miscellaneous banknotes one by one. The situation in Guangdong Province is different. Since the Reserve Custody Committee has been established, the power to issue banknotes is entirely in the hands of the Bank of Guangdong, accounting for 240,722,065.50 yuan, while the City Bank only accounts for 8,500,000 yuan. In my opinion, suppressing or raising the value of Guangdong currency is not in the interest of the people of Guangdong. The path we should take is to stabilize the currency of Guangdong Province. I will try to state my views as follows.</p>
<p>(4) Currency Stabilization Theory</p>
<p>This theory can be obtained from the three principles of the Ministry of Finance for reorganizing the Guangdong currency system, which state: (1) to prevent the vast majority of people from suffering losses during the reorganization; (2) not to reduce tax revenue excessively; (3) to integrate Guangdong currency with the legal tender reserve. Next are the four items listed in the opinion of the Guangdong Provincial Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Custody Special Committee: (1) to settle silver to strengthen people's faith; (2) (3) to stabilize the exchange rate between big and small dollars, and to consider the economic interests of the majority of the people; (4) to expand and contract banknotes according to social needs. As a believer in currency stabilization, I also agree with this theory. In my opinion, it is appropriate to stabilize the ratio of big dollars to small dollars at plus 1.5. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>A. It is suitable for commercial habits and encourages production enterprises. In the past few years, the exchange rate between Guangdong small dollars and Shanghai currency has mostly revolved around plus two, and Shanghai currency is actually the representative of national currency. Now, this ratio of plus 2.5 is not only suitable for commercial habits, but also slightly higher than the normal state in the past, so it encourages production enterprises.</p>
<p>B. Government tax revenue is not affected. In the past twenty years, the Guangdong provincial tax revenue and the exchange rate of big dollars have been calculated at plus two, then plus 2.5, and plus two. Today, setting the ratio at 2.5 does not change much, and the government's tax revenue will not be lost. This is the second point.</p>
<p>C. Banknotes and reserves are financially sound. In terms of reserves, according to Mr. Li Taichu's theory, combined with the calculation method of plus 2.5, the amount of banknote issuance without reserves is only several million yuan. There is still a huge amount of 180 million yuan of silver hidden among the people, and it is not difficult to raise sufficient silver reserves. The silver reserve for banknote issuance by each issuing bank in Shanghai is always above 70%. If it is not easy to buy silver in Guangdong for a while, it can be temporarily supplied by Shanghai, which is also easy to do. However, we should pay attention to the fact that silver reserves only have a psychological effect at best, and although it cannot be completely ignored, there is no need to worry too much.</p>
<p>D. To prevent speculation between big and small dollars. After the ratio of big dollars and small dollars is fixed at plus 2.5, the exchange rate with small dollars in Shanghai and other places will be very close, so as to prevent speculative activities of small dollars. Otherwise, at the beginning of the implementation of the new system, the old auxiliary currency can still be circulated, and its price will inevitably have abnormal changes, which can be predicted.</p>
<p>E. After the Guangdong currency is stabilized at a ratio of plus 2.5, the internal economy of the people of Guangdong will not be affected at all. If the government wants to implement a national devaluation policy in the future, it will not cause resentment among the people of Guangdong.</p>
<p>F. Finally, from the procedural point of view, it is also quite consistent to decide the ratio of big dollars to small dollars at 102.5 to 100.</p>
<p>Parity is the ratio of the metals contained in two different currencies. If this currency reform adopts a ratio of plus 2.5, which is very close to parity, then there will be no loss for those who use silver dollars, so they will be happy to use big dollars (i.e., exchange silver dollars for big dollar bills), which will obviously help the promotion of big dollar bills. If the ratio is fixed at plus five or plus six, then those who hold silver dollars will naturally not be willing to exchange them for legal tender at a low price, and the trend of hoarding will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>The above classification is made by me from the perspective of monetary science for the convenience of research. And the final currency stabilization theory can take into account all aspects, which is not only in line with theory, but also in line with the actual situation, so I think this theory is more correct. However, those who advocate currency stabilization pay the most attention to price stability. After the exchange rate issue is resolved, efforts should be made to stabilize prices. The above-mentioned special committee, as the agency for compiling the price index in Guangzhou, should continue to compile it. If there are abnormal changes in prices or exchange rates after the new system is implemented, the amount of banknote issuance can be expanded or contracted at any time to adjust it. Because monetary science is still very young today, it can only establish the principle of a policy, and the details of implementation still need to be based on statistical figures. —August 16 in Hong Kong— More swap transactions</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Securities: More Swap Transactions</h3>
<h3>The Bond Market Fluctuated Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, August 17th to 22nd, at the Huashang Securities Exchange, was the last week of futures trading for August. The trading resumed with two sessions each in the morning and afternoon. There were no significant changes in the situation, so the impact on the government bond market was also limited. The situation in Suiyuan and eastern Chahar fluctuated between tense and relaxed, and futures trading in government bonds has become an undeniable fact. The Guangdong currency reorganization will also issue public bonds. With too many boats in a narrow river, there is inevitably congestion. The government bond market is subject to various constraints. Large investors mostly engage in swap transactions, and they negotiate outside the market to reduce the volatility of the bond market. Therefore, the market did not experience a huge squeeze due to the proximity of delivery. Although the 96 government bond was raised to outside the ten yuan mark, it still failed to go straight up, which shows that rumors are not valuable and turned down greatly. Today is the last day of August, and it is still nothing more than a situation where swap transactions compete for gains and losses. Looking back on the past week, the environment was dull on Monday. The number 10 bond, which has always been short, suddenly went long, and the market price rose very sharply, by 45 cents to 90 cents, which was the best day of the week. The week was shrouded in swap transactions, and the market price was uneven. Category A alone fell, while the rest rose slightly. On Wednesday, due to the good situation, bulls came out, and the selling was very strong. Numbers 4 and 10 bonds all turned to selling, and fell back by half a yuan to 75 cents. On Thursday, the market was initially weak, but suddenly rose sharply at the close. There were also rumors in the market, and the market price actually rose by 12 cents to more than 70 cents. On Friday, there was suddenly a large amount of selling in the financial sector, and the market price was hit again, and the downward trend reappeared. Later, it recovered by 12 cents to 65 cents. On Saturday, short positions were covered, and swap transactions were not lively. The market price was firm, recovering by 12 cents to 56 cents. The market situation for the week fluctuated, which was controlled by swap transactions. It needs to wait until August is over before there will be greater changes. The results of the week's market price were slightly better, rising by 5 cents to 12 cents. Category B rose by 55 cents this month, which was the most. The 96 bond rose by 60 cents. The total number of transactions was 54.01 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Rainfall in the Northwest Drought Area, American and British Cotton Rise</h3>
<p>When the American cotton market opened, the news from Liverpool was good, and the news from Europe turned better. The market trend was still firm, and prices fell by 3 to 5 pence per pound. Later, bulls closed out positions, and cotton farmers hedged sales. It was reported that there was rain in the Northwest cotton area, from slight rain to one inch of rainfall. Buyers were afraid that hedging sales would increase and dared not take action. However, traders gradually entered the market around 11.5 cents, and the closing was firm. The spot price fell by 7 pence per pound, and the futures price fell by 3 to 7 pence per pound. The British cotton spot price fell by 4 points, and the futures price fell by 4 to 5 points. The Indian cotton price first fell due to bulls closing out positions, then recovered due to purchases by European exporters, then fell again due to rainfall in the Korat drought area, and then rose again due to purchases by European exporters. The prices for Pingguoer and Aomula were unchanged, and the price for Bairoxi rose by half a rupee. The original telegrams are recorded on the left. (Telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Bairoxi 32.50 Up 0.5 40.00</p>
<p>April-May Term 209.25 Flat 27.10</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 24th: the July-August term for Bairoxi was 220.5 rupees, down 1 rupee; the April-May term for Bairoxi was 208.5 rupees, down 0.75 rupees; the November-January term for Aomula was 189.5 rupees, down half a rupee.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Zinc Sheets Arrive in Quantity</h3>
<p>Because the mold season has passed, the actual sales of zinc sheets have gradually moved. Battery factories, printing factories, and fire factories have all been buying. Customers from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Jinan, and Hankou and Sichuan have also been buying a lot. Therefore, the market situation has been very active in recent days. Unfortunately, the arrival of goods has not kept up, resulting in a shortage of varieties. Since yesterday, new goods have arrived frequently at various foreign warehouses in Pudong and Puxi, and all varieties have been supplied, so there is no worry about shortages in the market. It has been found that a total of 4900 barrels have been opened in recent days. The market is stable because prices are firm and people's minds are calm, so there is no downward trend. The current market price for thin varieties is 135 yuan to 137 yuan per barrel, the price for medium varieties is 130 yuan, and the price for thick varieties is around 1223 yuan.</p>

<h3>Beginning of Studies on Folding Fans</h3>
<p>— Ni Gaofeng</p>
<p>Cui Bao's "Notes on Ancient and Modern Times" states: "Shun made five-ming fans." This is the origin of fans, but their shape and method of production are no longer attainable. After the Han Dynasty, round fans were commonly used, made of fine silk, hence also known as silk fans. At that time, many poems praised round fans, the most famous being Ban Jieyu's "Song of Complaint," which contains the line, "Newly made fine Qi silk, round like the bright moon." Jiang Yan's poem contains the line, "The silk fan is like a round moon, coming from the loom." Thus, their shape and material were the same as those in vogue today, but there is no mention of folding fans. Folding fans can also be called "clustered-small fans" or "folding fans." The time of their origin is debated. According to the "Book of Southern Qi": "Chu Yuan used a waist fan to shield the sun." Hu Sanxing's note states: "Waist fans are worn at the waist, now called folding fans." This is the earliest appearance of the term "folding fan." Zhao Yanwei's "Yünlù Man Cao" states, "Folding fans use steamed bamboo as bones, lined with silk, and wealthy families sometimes use ivory for the head, decorated with gold and silver, probably originating from Goryeo." Lu Shen's "Spring Breeze Hall Notes" states, "Since the Southern Song Dynasty, many poems and lyrics have praised clustered-small fans. Su Dongpo mentioned a white pine fan from Goryeo, which, when opened, was more than a foot wide, and when closed, was only about two fingers thick, just like today's folding fans, suggesting that they already existed in the Northern Song Dynasty." It also says, "The Japanese made them with gold-painted surfaces and black bamboo bones as tribute." According to Zhao and Lu's accounts, folding fans already existed in the Song Dynasty, but one says they came from Goryeo, and the other says they were tribute from the Japanese, a slight difference. However, "Autumn Enclosure Miscellaneous Ornaments" claims: "During the Yuan Dynasty, Goryeo presented folding fans as tribute. During the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, they began to be popular in China. During the Xuande and Hongzhi periods, Li Zhao and Ma Dong were both famous for making fans." "Tianlu Kan Yu" also says: "Folding fans were anciently called clustered-small fans, held by servants, for convenient concealment in sleeves, to avoid the eyes of the noble. In the Yuan Dynasty, Goryeo began to present them as tribute. During the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, people began to imitate them slightly. Now they are becoming increasingly popular, and round fans are discarded." According to these two accounts, folding fans entered in the Yuan Dynasty from Goryeo, which differs from the previous two accounts. Generally, in the Song Dynasty, the Eastern Yi, Goryeo, occasionally presented folding fans as tribute, but they were not yet popular in China. By the Yuan Dynasty, those two countries presented them as tribute more frequently, so their popularity gradually increased domestically. By the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese were already imitating them themselves. This is a brief history of folding fans. Some say that clustered-small fans are different from folding fans, citing "Qu Tang Hua Ji," which states: "Folding fans are also round fans, which can be rolled and stretched, different from what is called clustered-small fans today." This is probably because there were no clustered-small fans during the Southern Qi Dynasty, and Hu Sanxing, in his commentary on the "Book of Qi," said that waist fans are today's folding fans, so he suspected that folding fans and clustered-small fans were different. However, round fans that can be rolled and stretched not only do not exist today, but there is also no mention of them in historical records, so his argument is ultimately unsubstantiated. As for Hu, who lived in the Yuan Dynasty, his commentary on the "Zizhi Tongjian," now called folding this and that, is using the present to explain the past, which is a common practice among annotators. Yan Shigu's commentary on the "Book of Han" has many such examples, so there is no need to be rigid about it.</p>
<h3>The Standpoint of National Suicide</h3>

<h3>Half-Sheng Hall</h3>
<p>— Guang Ji</p>
<p>Half-Sheng Hall is the name of a rich family's hall in our town. As for how it came to be called Half-Sheng Hall, that's quite a story.</p>
<p>The father of this rich family was a famous wealthy merchant, but when it was passed down to his son, because he had been spoiled since childhood, once he had power, he indulged in reckless prostitution and gambling, a life of luxury and dissipation. Limited money could not supply endless extravagance. In a few short years, the family fortune was squandered! After "everything was pawned" and "even porridge was unavailable," his father passed away due to illness! All that was left was half a sheng of rice that hadn't been eaten. When it was the turn of the rich man to take over, even though the "family circumstances were bleak," he was not discouraged or lazy. Instead, he was self-disciplined and frugal, taking the rice to the street to exchange for some sweets, taking them to the countryside to peddle, and then selling some local products from the countryside in the street, turning it over and over, earning a small profit. In this way, after a year or two, he accumulated several hundred yuan. Coincidentally, at this time, there was flooding, and the land along the embankment was available for cultivation. He used all the money to buy seeds and sowed them in the gaps. Fortunately, there was a bumper harvest that year, and he harvested a large amount of rice. Later, he also did some rice business, which went smoothly, so he created so many properties. Fearing that future generations would only know how to enjoy themselves and not understand the hardship of the ancestors' entrepreneurship, he named the hall Half-Sheng Hall to commemorate and show it to future generations.</p>
<p>I think this is right, because his descendants will be able to maintain the family fortune in the future.</p>
<h3>Luan and Phoenix Exchanging Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Double Happiness Returns, Poems Inscribed on Leaves; Wedding Dress Tries on Luan, Tears Stain Silk Shawl</p>
<p>Therefore, although he tried his best to calm down and do his work as usual, he felt weak all over, as if he were sick, and he didn't know how to make himself comfortable. In desperation, he felt a little better only when he lay in bed. Therefore, he didn't read at night for two nights, and he also got up very late the next morning. On this morning, Liu Ma called outside the door: There's a registered letter. Please get up and stamp it. Guoqi thought it was the Shanghai Bookstore sending the royalties, so he quickly put on his clothes and got out of bed. He opened the door, stamped the letter, and took it. It was a thick envelope. The sender's address was written as Wu Siren, Danfeng Street, North of the City. He didn't have such a friend. When he opened the letter, it was a piece of white Xuan paper, with an eight-line note inside. This was a strange thing. He didn't have time to look at the eight-line note, so he held the Xuan paper up to the light. It turned out to be a green orchid, and the upper inscription was "For the Appreciation of Mr. Litian." The lower inscription was "Respectfully painted by the Master of Peilan Studio in late spring of the second year of the Republic of China." There was a quatrain on it: "Who will see you in the secluded valley? Spring comes, but you are alone. I have painted three or five leaves to send to a pure-hearted person." After Guoqi read it, he felt like a lottery winner who had won the jackpot, so happy that he wanted to jump up. He blurted out to himself: She agreed. So he put down the painting and immediately picked up the eight-line note to read. The few lines of writing on it were unusually delicate. The text was:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Litian's Esteemed Consideration: Upon receiving your second letter, I cannot help but feel anxious and ashamed. I told you before with utmost sincerity that my family rules are strict. The suspicion of melons and plums is only a small matter. Unexpectedly, long nights and short poems came one after another. Those who are like orchids in the ashes and dead wood cannot bear it, and it is more than just laughable. Sir, you are handsome and talented, and you are about to make friends with the people of the world and be famous among scholars. Why must you be so devoted to a weak woman who does not improve herself? I have painted a picture of orchid leaves to fill the blank space on your wall. This is not to repay your kindness, but to bid you farewell. With this memento, I should not fail to live up to your appreciation. I beg you to cherish your future and not send any more letters. I know my guilt, I know my guilt.</p>
<p>Respectfully, the Master of Peilan Studio, re拜 (bows twice)"</p>
<p>This was truly unexpected. The orchid painting was not a token of engagement, but a symbol of breaking off. After the gentleman finished reading the letter in one breath, he studied its meaning. She truly did not want to receive any more letters. However, she did not think that the letters he had written were offensive to her. From all aspects, she was a woman with both new knowledge and old morality. If he were to forgive her, it would be more appropriate not to write to her again. He took the letter and stood in the middle of the room, lost in thought. Liu Ma brought tea into the room, but he didn't even see it. His right hand held the stack of stationery, stroking it against the palm of his left hand. When Liu Ma called him twice, he finally woke up. He saw a pot of tea on the table and poured himself a cup. He picked up the cup, intending to drink, but felt his mouth was a little dry. This was because he hadn't washed his face or gargled yet. So he went to wash his face (page 64)</p>

<h3>To the Country of "Midnight Sun" - Wang Jingqi Talks About Relations Between China, Sweden, and Norway</h3>
<p>— Selfless</p>
<p>At 5 PM on August 18th, the red sun was high in the sky, and the weather was stiflingly hot. The Shanghai New Customs Wharf was crowded with people of all nationalities. Dozens of brightly colored flower baskets were displayed on the ferry. The newly appointed Minister to Sweden and Norway, Dr. Wang Jingqi, wearing a white serge suit and glasses, shook hands with each person who came to see him off at the wharf. He boarded the small customs ferry "Liping," and with the sound of the whistle, Minister Wang stood at the bow of the boat and waved goodbye as the senders waved their handkerchiefs and scarves. He boarded the German postal ship "Lanzino" and set sail for his new post at 8 AM on the 19th.</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway are two kingdoms in Northern Europe, located on the Scandinavian Peninsula, south of the Arctic Ocean and north of the Baltic Sea. Because the journey from China is far, Chinese people are relatively unfamiliar with the customs and political situation of these two countries. The reporter specifically inquired about this on the ferry, and Minister Wang kindly gave the following written statement:</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway were originally both vassal states of Denmark. At the beginning of the 16th century, Sweden broke away from Denmark and became independent, laying the foundation for the kingdom. In 1814, Norway separated from Denmark and also declared independence, but still recognized the Swedish monarch as its ruler, a kind of semi-independent state. It was not until 1905 that it declared its separation from Sweden and completed its independence. The division between Sweden and Norway has only been around for over thirty years.</p>
<p>"Sweden is an agricultural country, with a population of over six million, most of whom are farmers. Iron is the most abundant product. There are many forests in the country, and the timber and paper industries are also well-developed. The match trade is the world's best. Trade between China and Sweden began in 1847. The main imported goods to China are paper, copper, iron, and matches. The goods shipped from China to Sweden are tung oil, textiles, and antiques. According to customs statistics in 1935, the total value of Swedish imports was 8,587,284 yuan. The total value of exports to Sweden was 14,100,954 yuan.</p>
<p>Norway is a newly emerging industrialized country. The population is 2,810,000. The climate is extremely cold. Arable land accounts for only 4% of the total area, and habitable land accounts for only 75% of the total area. Fish is the main product. Before the European War, agriculture and forestry were relatively developed, but after the war, industry and commerce greatly declined. Imported goods from China include paper, cod liver oil, biscuits, milk powder, canned goods, and fish. Goods shipped from China to Norway include silk, silkworm cocoons, grains, tung oil, tea oil, duck feathers, and pig intestines. According to the 1935 customs report, the value of imports to China from Norway was 4,858,518 yuan. The value of exports to Norway was 604,801 yuan.</p>
<p>As for China's international relations with Sweden and Norway, in addition to the aforementioned trade situation, there is also cooperation in academic culture between China and Sweden. In recent years, Chinese and Swedish scientists have jointly formed the Northwest Scientific Expedition Team, cooperating with the Swedish Dr. Sven Hedin to collect various materials and specimens related to geology, meteorology, astronomy, humans, archaeology, and folklore, which will definitely contribute to science. Although there has not yet been such cooperation with Norway, the works of several famous Norwegian writers, such as Strindberg, Ibsen, and Bjørnson, have been translated into Chinese and have had a considerable impact on China's New Culture Movement."</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Wang told the reporter: "Because our people do not fully understand the situation in Sweden and Norway, they often regard the spectacle of the midnight sun in Northern Europe as an overseas oddity. This time, I am going to Sweden and Norway, and I will only uphold the government's intentions, strengthen friendly relations, and promote business and cultural endeavors. I would never dare to be greedy for the beautiful mountains and rivers of Northern Europe, and I only know how to serve the country. I am even more willing to introduce Chinese culture to the two countries of Northern Europe, so that the friendship between the two great nations of the East and West can be enhanced, and we can deeply understand each other."</p>
<p>Little Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Two Women</h3>
<p>— (Yang Bianli)</p>
<p>The German writer Balzac said in his book "The Physiology of Marriage": "There are often two women in a man's heart: one is the one he wants, but cannot get; the other is the one he gets, but is not the one he wants." In other words, even if the one he wants is obtained, she is no longer the one he wants. Alas! How can that desire ever be satisfied? This self-centeredness can be said to be the height of selfishness?</p>
<h3>Painted Stockings and Anklets</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Modern women, in the summer, are popularizing exposing their breasts and arms, baring their legs and feet, fully displaying their flesh. However, their legs are either yellow and thin or covered in scars. So they're now adding some kind of powder that used to be rubbed on their arms to their legs.</p>
<p>This year, they have added two new and novel ornaments—painted stockings and anklets. The so-called painted stockings are fake stockings painted on the legs, so the legs are completely bare, so that the painted ones resemble flesh-colored stockings. The painting method of this kind of fake stockings is very delicate. Its silk texture is exactly the same, and it is difficult to distinguish the real from the fake. It's just a pity that it cannot be washed. Because once it is exposed to water, the makeup will be washed away, returning to its original appearance.</p>
<p>Women's bare legs and feet have been popular for many years. This has indeed caused losses for sock factories. But businessmen are, after all, resourceful. In addition to providing nail polish to decorate their toes, this year they have invented a kind of gold anklet to decorate their calves. On the anklets, there are also several small bells that ring when they walk.</p>
<h3>Inverted Consciousness</h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>A certain gentleman had just graduated from university and was about to go abroad to study. On the night before boarding the ship, at a public farewell banquet, he presented a beautiful booklet, asking those present to write some farewell messages.</p>
<p>The booklet was passed to a "vigorous and young" friend, who was about to pick up a pen to leave a message. Suddenly, he saw a horizontal line in the middle of all the words on the booklet and couldn't help but exclaim, "What's the meaning of this? Why scold people for being 'tired of not learning'?"</p>
<p>But in a moment, he also laughed with the crowd, because he immediately realized that he had been misunderstood by the habit of "writing Chinese like Western writing." It was originally a well-intentioned idiom: "Fond of learning and never tired"!</p>

<h3>How to Solve Stubborn Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Imperial University of Japan</p>
<p>Those suffering from gonorrhea for a long time can be completely cured with this treatment.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is the most difficult venereal disease to eradicate. Its stubbornness is far greater than syphilis and chancroid. For example, syphilis has Salvarsan 606, a special medicine that can be injected, and chancroid does not recur after it is cured. Only gonorrhea, when it becomes chronic, often seems to have no very terrible symptoms on the surface, but once it encounters stimulating places, these cunning gonococci will secretly flare up. This situation is most common in paraurethritis and prostatitis in gonorrhea. When you look at the urine discharged, it is almost clear. Therefore, patients do not pay much attention to it, so they indulge in drinking, sexual activity, and labor, which is a great opportunity to stimulate the gonococci to flare up. Such repeated recurrence often leads to fatal dangers such as endocarditis and septicemia.</p>
<p>Those who do not know about this stubborn gonorrhea generally think that it can be cured by taking percutaneous bactericidal drugs. In fact, the pathology is not that simple. We don't need a comprehensive treatment. Secondly, a patient surnamed Xu had been suffering from the disease for six or seven years. He originally suffered from prostatitis, but because it recurred repeatedly, he used percutaneous bactericidal drugs every time to deal with it perfunctorily. He did not expect that the symptoms would become more and more severe, and it had changed from prostatitis to systemic infectious arthritis. He no longer dared to use such drugs to harm himself. After seeking medical treatment, after strict examination, I felt that anti-gonorrhea bactericidal drugs were indispensable, so I told him to buy and take "Kelinnong" from various pharmacies for five consecutive weeks, and it was completely cured. His wife's leukorrhea was also instructed by me to take "Kelinnong" internally and use "Carl Sheet's Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories to remove the gonorrhea. Living together until now, not only has it not recurred, but they have also had a son. The reason why "Kelinnong" has this effect is that it has the effect of producing anti-gonorrhea bactericidal action in the body. Moreover, this action occurs directly on the lesion, without damaging healthy tissue. This is a characteristic that any anti-gonorrhea bactericidal drug cannot match. Purchasers must recognize it clearly.</p>
<h3>Women's Leukorrhea Affects Fertility</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>If a woman has leukorrhea, not only can she not show the typical beauty and health, but it is also the root of all kinds of diseases, so we must eliminate it. Examining the causes of this disease, some originate from the inside, and some come from the outside. What does it mean to originate from the inside? That is, many cases of incomplete physical development, menstrual disorders, and diseases of the uterus and nearby organs can be classified into this category. If a husband has a history of gonorrhea, so that bacteria can be infected during sexual activity, he will also become gonorrhea leukorrhea. Moreover, due to masturbation, the mucous membrane is rubbed off, allowing bacteria to take advantage of it and cause various dangers. This is also something that we often see in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Patients, day and night, have a trickle of yellow and white foul liquid flowing out of the vagina, causing the local area to become eroded and even suppurate into ulcers, destroying the entire reproductive function. This is an even more terrible consequence. If the menstruation is very regular, it will also be disrupted due to leukorrhea, and because of the menstrual disorder, it will not be able to conceive. Regarding the appropriate and effective treatment of this disease, I instructed the patients to buy and use "Carl Sheet's Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories from various pharmacies, and they can always achieve the effect of removal in a short period of time. This treatment is very simple. Those who suffer from this disease can secretly use this tablet at home by themselves, without any side effects. (Use one tablet as a suppository in the vagina before going to bed each time, and wash it off the next morning.) However, if it is caused by physical weakness, in addition to using this tablet, you must take "Bunü Rong" internally to regulate menstruation and nourish blood, and promote the healing of leukorrhea. If it is gonorrhea leukorrhea, then it is necessary to also take "Kelinnong." Because "Kelinnong" has the effect of producing anti-gonorrhea bacteria in the body. It can help "Carl's Vaginal Tablets" exert their bactericidal effect. Therefore, it can shorten the treatment period and also avoid recurrence.</p>

<p>The Danger Period for Young People - Terrible Masturbation</p>
<p>Masturbation is the most common bad habit of young people. Once a patient commits this, it is difficult to quit, so the development of various parts of the body is suddenly hit. In the case of young people who are developing, how can they withstand daily destruction? It is appropriate that all kinds of diseases will gather. Therefore, those who have already developed will degenerate due to incomplete function. Those who have not developed will not be able to continue to develop. The lower part is small like a child. Even if they are lucky enough to develop a little, it is also deformed, and the result is equivalent to not being able to develop. From this, there are symptoms that follow from the inability to develop, such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, mental slowness, loss of interest, and abnormally weak memory, which leads to stupidity in reading, and the exams are all behind, so it increases depression. Other symptoms such as tinnitus, blurred vision, headache, insomnia, and sexual stimulation cause the nerves to become weaker. All symptoms are further deepened, and the hope of life is completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, according to our treatment, "Buti Kang," a drug for men in the hormone preparation, is the most effective treatment. At the same time, it is supplemented with electrotherapy. If there is nocturnal emission, it is supplemented with "Naiers Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to treat nocturnal emission. "Buti Kang" was invented by the German Mr. Luns. Its raw materials are extracted from the hormones of strong animals. Those who suffer from incomplete development and nocturnal emission caused by masturbation can fully develop their youthful glands in a few weeks after taking it, so that sexual function can be fully developed, and all the symptoms caused by masturbation can be cured. This is what we have jointly experienced over the years. The number of people who have been cured by taking "Buti Kang" is unknown. This drug has long been popular in Europe and the United States, and major pharmacies in our country have "Buti Kang" for sale.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Gonorrhea Treatments</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Medical Doctor of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Killing Bacteria Always Carries Systemic Danger! Besides Increasing Natural Healing Ability, What Other Shortcut Can Be Followed?</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea, too rapid is harmful to health, too slow is useless. Percutaneous sterilization locally, the medicinal power does not reach, and gonococci have proliferated and spread to the posterior urethra and the whole body. How can a cup of water save a cart of firewood? If you blindly use strong drugs to kill gonococci in the whole body, then you will be harmed before you benefit from it; therefore, various complications come one after another: such as arthritis that makes people disabled, and endocarditis that leads to sudden death, are obvious examples.</p>
<p>Then what is the most reliable method for treating gonorrhea? There is: only by arousing the inherent "natural healing ability" of the human body is the most! Only "Kelinnong," the holy medicine for gonorrhea, can live up to it. Why do I say that? Because the human body originally has an antibacterial force, this antibacterial force exists in the function of every cell and blood cell. This is what is called "natural healing ability." If we are infected with gonococci, the cells and blood cells will play an anti-toxic role. If the proliferation of gonococci is faster, the anti-toxic power will gradually decrease, until gonorrhea changes from acute to chronic, and then various diseases arise. At this time, if you do not take "Kelinnong" to increase the "natural healing ability" of cells and blood cells, then the condition will be in danger.</p>
<p>The preparation of "Kelinnong" was created by Dr. Peter Bledel, a German authority on gonorrhea, based on his theoretical achievements and clinical experimental results, and made from protein lipids and pure and flawless pigments. It is most effective for all acute and chronic gonorrhea or leukorrhea in men and women, and chronic prostatitis, testicular inflammation, and arthritis in men! I have repeatedly cured many people at home and abroad. However, for women suffering from gonorrhea leukorrhea, in addition to taking this drug internally, I also use the external treatment "Carl Sheet's Tablets" as a suppository, because the medicinal properties are all the right way, not only without any drawbacks, but also can completely cure all within four or five weeks to seven or eight weeks without recurrence.</p>
<h3>A Case of Cured Chronic Cough</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Yuanhe, Director of the Shanghai South People's Hospital</p>
<p>Those suffering from persistent, long-term coughs are generally afflicted with chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is often caused by neglecting common colds. Autumn is here, and with it comes the daily occurrence of colds and coughs. Residents should be extremely cautious! A patient, Mr. Jiang Shaobai, age 22, contracted a cough early this summer due to being exposed to the cool air late at night. He experienced frequent coughing fits, difficulty expectorating phlegm, dryness in the throat, and severe coughing, especially at night, making it impossible to lie flat. The phlegm was thick and abundant. He had taken various medications without success. The prolonged illness weakened his body, developing into a chronic cough with internal damage. He was introduced by his friend, Mr. Tao Menglong, whom I had previously cured of a lung ailment, and came to me for treatment. I diagnosed him with chronic bronchitis, which ordinary medications could not cure. Therefore, I prescribed "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung-Nourishing Na Er) to treat the chronic cough and prevent lung damage, while simultaneously prescribing "Bu Ti Kang" (Body-Nourishing Kang) to restore his weakened state. After four weeks of treatment, the phlegm cleared, the cough subsided, his energy significantly increased, his complexion brightened, and he was declared cured. I have also found that "Bu Fei Na Er" is effective in treating whooping cough in children, asthma in the elderly, and other respiratory ailments involving phlegm and cough, especially in removing phlegm. It has remarkable effects!</p>
<h3>Lung Disease Notes</h3>
<p>— Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, Dr. Zheng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road Clinic Hours: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM Note: Are there special drugs for Lung Disease?</p>
<p>My study of lung disease has become a sort of obsession. This is because during my time in medical school, I particularly enjoyed specializing in cardiology and pulmonology. In my medical practice, the patients I encountered were mostly tuberculosis patients. Furthermore, when I was teaching at the medical university, I lectured on cardiology and pulmonology. Students at all levels, knowing my dedication to this field, would often ask whether there was a specific drug for lung disease. Is there really no specific drug for lung disease? Why are there so many medicines for treating lung disease? If there was already one, why is lung disease so difficult to treat? I have always struggled with this question and could not answer it hastily. In clinical practice, lung patients also often asked this question, which caused me great distress. Any lung disease physician must have experienced this kind of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Today, science is flourishing, and medical advancements are especially rapid. Treatments for lung disease have undergone significant improvements. These include surgical procedures such as artificial pneumothorax and thoracoplasty, as well as medical treatments that supplement connective tissue in the lungs and reduce oxygen levels. Apart from the certain indications for surgery, I most appreciate these newly developed drug therapies. The medication is called "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung-Nourishing Na Er), invented by Dr. Tu Mei. I have used this drug to treat tuberculosis coughs, the expectoration of spherical sputum, chest pain, decreased appetite, coughing up blood, emaciation, and other symptoms with good results. For lung disease with cerebral asthenia, insomnia, palpitations, other symptoms, besides taking "Bu Fei Na Er", should also take "Bu Ti Kang" for men (this medicine also cures impotence, back pain, premature ejaculation, and if there is nocturnal emission, can take "Yi Jing Pian" (Emission Pills) to treat. For women, take "Bu Nu Rong" (Female Beauty Supplement) (this medicine can also regulate menstruation, treat vaginal discharge, and treat prenatal and postpartum illnesses) to treat it. It will turn weakness into strength, rejuvenate the spirit, increase weight, and completely eliminate the tuberculosis. All the above medicines are available in the Western medicine departments of Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun department stores and major pharmacies.</p>
<h3>The Evils Caused by Masturbation - Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>Clinic: Across from Tonghe Bank, Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Two Fundamental Methods to Focus on for Saving Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Masturbation is a significant problem for young people. Among men, few can remain chaste. Masturbation is the mechanical stimulation of nerves, so the nerves are the first to be harmed and enter a weakened state. On one hand, it can lead to neurasthenia, causing symptoms such as mental confusion and listlessness. Emotions become chaotic, easily leading to sadness, resentment, and baseless self-pity, often accompanied by suicidal thoughts. The ability to concentrate diminishes, judgment and memory weaken, and self-confidence is lost. As a result, there is no persistence in work, a constant daze, headaches, tinnitus, insomnia, and palpitations, all arising from a state of weakness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it can lead to sexual neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and sperm leakage after exertion or bowel movements. This weakens reproductive function, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, back pain, erectile dysfunction, and even incomplete development. According to research abroad and reports from renowned physicians in various countries, absolutely taking German "Nairisi" "Yi Jing Pian" (Emission Pills) is the main treatment, supplemented by the endocrine preparation "Bu Ti Kang". "Nairisi Yi Jing Pian" (Emission Pills) is a sacred medicine specifically for nocturnal emission. Whether it occurs daily or multiple times a day, it is effective after taking it. It can also enhance willpower and reduce nerve stimulation, so those with the bad habit of masturbation, even if deeply ingrained, will naturally stop after taking "Nairisi Yi Jing Pian" (Emission Pills). "Bu Ti Kang" is an effective remedy for the aforementioned weakness symptoms in patients with nocturnal emission. Taking these two medicines together for about three or four weeks can result in a full recovery. If taken continuously for two months, even severe kidney deficiency and incomplete development can achieve the most satisfactory results. "Yi Jing Pian" (Emission Pills) is available at Wing On and Chinese and Western pharmacies.</p>
<h3>Minor Statistics on Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhonglin, Bachelor of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>(The above cases were all cured after taking about half a dozen to one dozen of "Ke Lin Nong" (Overcome Nong), and the root was proven by blood tests.)</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Acute Gonorrhea Cured in a Short Time</h3>
<p>— Nantong Medical University, Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>“The Pain after Love Lost” difficult Urination</p>
<p>Patient Mr. He Zhonghai, age 23, succumbed to indulging in brothels after experiencing heartbreak. Within three weeks, he developed a burning sensation in his urethra, with pus and mucus accumulating, causing extremely difficult urination. His glans became red and swollen, and the foreskin turned outward, causing unbearable pain and constant moaning. Since Mr. He was already mentally depressed after the failed romance, this unexpected gonorrhea further fueled his desire to end his life. Fortunately, his friend, Mr. Zhou, consoled him and introduced him to me for treatment. After performing a disinfection and washing procedure, I prescribed "Ke Lin Nong" (Overcome Nong) to combat gonorrhea, kill bacteria, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. In just three weeks, all gonococci were cleared, and all pain disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission in Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Liu Dayue, age 25, contracted gonorrhea three days after visiting a prostitute, complicated by nocturnal emission. The urethral discharge was like flocs, and the urethral pain was like being pricked by needles, with pain also in the lower abdomen. He initially took drugs that penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, but they were ineffective. The local pain affected his entire body, and the nocturnal emission caused insomnia, headaches, and extreme restlessness. He came to me for treatment, and it was determined to be acute seminal vesiculitis. I prescribed "Ke Lin Nong" (Overcome Nong) to eliminate the gonococci in the lesion and promote the disappearance of inflammation, along with "Nairisi Yi Jing Pian" (Emission Pills) to treat his nocturnal emission. After a total of three weeks and four days of treatment, all his ailments were cured, and the blood serum test showed no gonococcal reaction. Thus, Mr. Liu's gonorrhea was proven to be completely cured, and his nocturnal emission was also completely resolved. His body became exceptionally strong.</p>
<h3>Curing Obesity to a Slim Figure Treatment of Thyroid Atrophy</h3>
<p>— Song Zhongyu, Army Medical University</p>
<p>Previously, my colleague, Mr. Jiang Shaochun, and I went to Nanyang, Rangoon and other places for inspection, and saw a woman, about 40 years old, staying in a local hospital for treatment. This woman's symptoms were quite peculiar, with malnutrition and skin like animal hide, edema, and obesity, a dull and lifeless appearance, increased weight (as shown in Figure A), sluggishness, memory loss, impaired mobility, slow pulse, and changes in vasomotor activity. Her blood pressure was around 125 mmHg, her body temperature was low, and she had difficult menstruation. After examination, it was determined that the woman had thyroid atrophy, and the thyroid function was reduced, resulting in Myxoedem. Endocrine therapy was performed, and the female hormone preparation "Bu Nu Rong" (Female Beauty Supplement) invented by Merlin was prescribed. After taking it for six weeks, the thyroid function was improved, the body gradually became thinner and more active, the muscles became fuller and better nourished, and the original beautiful appearance was restored (as shown in Figure B). The menstrual cycle was adjusted, and she was discharged from the hospital after three weeks of recuperation. When the woman was first treated by Dr. Jin in the hospital, I was inspecting elsewhere, and it was only two days before the patient was discharged when I returned. Dr. Jin shared the course of the disease as such. It is also seen that the efficacy of "Bu Nu Rong" (Female Beauty Supplement) is remarkable. This medicine not only treats thyroid diseases, but also has special effects on incomplete development, thin hips, small breasts, irregular menstruation, infertility, insomnia, neurasthenia, leucorrhea, etc. It can also be purchased and taken by oneself without any drawbacks. This medicine is sold in major pharmacies at home and abroad.</p>

<h3>Indigestion Bad Breath, Constipation</h3>
<p>It is essential to pay attention to the health of digestive function. Otherwise, neglect can lead to chronic diseases, and various stomach ailments will arise! Generally, the symptoms of weak stomach function include bad breath, excessive salivation upon waking, a bitter taste in the mouth, decreased appetite, and chest tightness. The symptoms of weak intestinal function include constipation or undigested food, easy diarrhea, and loose stools, with constipation being the most common! According to my clinical experience, "Qiang Wei Jing" (Stomach Strengthening Essence) is the main treatment for these conditions! After taking "Qiang Wei Jing" (Stomach Strengthening Essence), the stomach will digest very well, appetite will improve, and there will be good digestion. All stomach pain, bloating, chest tightness, acid reflux, eructation, constipation, or other conditions will be effectively treated. This medicine is also effective for treating beriberi, as it contains a large amount of Vitamin B. "Qiang Wei Jing" (Stomach Strengthening Essence) is available in all major pharmacies.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The two problems currently facing the government that must be resolved as soon as possible are the North China issue externally and the Southwest issue internally. These two issues may not seem to be directly related, but the methods for resolving them are closely intertwined. The saying "the collapse of the Jin Mountains in the north will echo in Luoyang in the east" illustrates this point.</p>
<p>Regarding North China, after the Japanese Garrison Army convened a staff meeting a few days ago, military officials from Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces attended to discuss various North China issues. On one hand, negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations will begin once Kawagoe arrives in Beijing. The negotiation direction is still based on the three principles of Hirota. Although the details of the staff meeting and negotiations are not yet clear, the seriousness of the North China situation is undeniable.</p>
<p>Regarding the Southwest, since Chen Jitang stepped down, the Guangdong province is no longer a problem. However, recent news from Guangxi indicates that Li and Bai intend to consolidate their power and refuse to accept central government orders, which is regrettable. Li and Bai made significant contributions during the Northern Expedition, and recently their governance of Guangxi has also achieved considerable success. If Li and Bai could suddenly realize their errors and apply their spirit of governing Guangxi to Zhejiang, and their internal methods to external affairs, then their future contributions would surely surpass their contributions during the Northern Expedition. However, they persist in their errors, fighting like trapped beasts. I do not understand their intentions.</p>
<p>The reason why the central government has hesitated to use drastic measures against Li and Bai is precisely this. Therefore, they are willing to compromise and discuss the matter at length, hoping that Li and Bai will consider the overall situation and allow the Guangxi issue to be resolved peacefully. The extent of the central government's tolerance towards Guangxi is only this great. Now Li and Bai have been defiant for a long time, unwilling to change their minds, and ignoring telegrams of advice. Recently, there have been alarming reports of them forming a government and deploying strategies. If disaster strikes, everything will be destroyed. Even if Li and Bai do not consider their own lives and fortunes, do they not consider the general population of Guangxi? This attitude is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>While Li and Bai's contributions during the Northern Expedition and their achievements in governing Guangxi cannot be denied, their refusal to obey central government orders and come north is a sin that can be enumerated. Li and Bai cannot deny their guilt: first, the crime of undermining national unity; second, the crime of undermining domestic peace; third, the crime of undermining national spirit and solidarity; and fourth, the crime of undermining the diplomatic front and causing obstacles. Even if Li and Bai do not consider Guangxi, do they not consider the survival of the Chinese nation?</p>
<p>But Li and Bai say: I do not have time to consider anything. I would rather be a bandit, I would rather join the Communist Party, I do not care about any sacrifice, I do not care about any destruction. Is this foolish or evil? Unwilling to be a contributor to the Republic of China, but willing to be a sinner of the Republic of China. What is the reason for this? I cannot help but feel sorry for Li and Bai, and even more for my country.</p>
<h3>Tofu Ah Wen</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>The tofu dregs in the bamboo basket are pressed on the wooden frame, dripping with milk-like soy milk.</p>
<p>It’s pitch black inside the house, with the sour smell of bean juice evaporating. White paste still drips drop by drop under the millstone, and the water bucket is almost full.</p>
<p>A big rat-like donkey pants, dragging the mill around and around on the wet ground. By the brick pool, in the bowl rack next to the mountain stove, a small Mobil lamp flickers. The small flame mixes with the smoke from the chimney, making the room dark like a coal mine.</p>
<p>"Ooh—wheeze," Ah Wen's wife arches her back at the stove to cook rice. The donkey stops to defecate, and she turns around and shouts.</p>
<p>The sky outside the window is getting dark, and the cold wind is still blowing, making the leaves laugh and roll.</p>
<p>Ah Wen carries an empty tofu peddler's pole, walking back to the alley from the street.</p>
<p>"Is the tofu all gone?" Wang the fat owner of the sesame cake shop greets Ah Wen with a smile, squinting his eyes.</p>
<p>"It's gone. Mr. Wang, have you eaten yet?"</p>
<p>"I have. Ah Wen, you're really working hard all day."</p>
<p>"Hey, how can you not suffer if you're living a poor life?" Ah Wen said and slowly walked out of the alley.</p>
<p>"How could someone like Ah Wen marry such a pretty wife?" Lin Er asks, holding an empty enamel basin, standing at the entrance of the barbershop.</p>
<p>The shoe repairman, nicknamed Bad Scraps, raises his head and laughs:</p>
<p>"A lazy man marries a beauty—Hey, Lin Er, do you know that someone wants Ah Wen's wife?"</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it, you can't touch her, what a joke!" Heh, Lin Er pushes open the wind door and walks in.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang touches the fat on his cheeks, his cracked mouth looks like a cotton peach: "They're a proper couple, what nonsense are you talking about!"</p>
<p>"Don't believe it, isn't this official's cousin Hu Yinsheng drinking soy milk there every morning?"</p>
<p>"They're doing business!"</p>
<p>"Isn't selling meat cakes business?"</p>
<p>"A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory!"</p>
<p>In the cool night, the third watch drum is beating in the alley, the tall poplar trees and the leaves are flying. The cries in the wind are a little desolate.</p>
<p>Ah Wen and his wife are sleeping soundly, the little donkey is eating grass in the shed, and the door is tightly closed.</p>
<p>"Bang...bang bang..."</p>
<p>Ah Wen's wife wakes up first, her heart beating.</p>
<p>"Wake up, listen, someone is knocking on the door."</p>
<p>Ah Wen rubs his eyes, turns over, puts on his cotton robe, and asks angrily:</p>
<p>"Who is it, in the middle of the night!"</p>
<p>"It's me, can't you hear? I'm Mr. Hu, from the Public Security Bureau..."</p>
<p>The door opens, a gust of cold wind crawls up Ah Wen's spine, he feels strange, Mr. Hu stumbles in, his butt bumping the door panel, his fist raised like a hammer:</p>
<p>"Ah Wen, don't shout, I want to discuss something with you."</p>
<p>Ah Wen feels like he's hit with a ball on his chest and his head is burning. He looks at the small foreign gun in Mr. Hu's hand.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, we poor people don't have money..."</p>
<p>"Bullshit, I want your money, you go out and find a place to sleep,"</p>
<p>Mr. Hu stares with bulging eyes, takes a breath, and takes out a silver dollar from his pocket "Take this, come back at dawn. Isn't it better than selling tofu?"</p>
<p>Ah Wen's chest only rises, like a small stone, a suffocating anger attacks his heart. His eyes glare, his dark face droops, his left arm rises to block, and the small foreign gun flies to the side of the tofu bucket.</p>
<p>"Fuck your mother, get out!" Ah Wen slams the door shut.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu massages his back, crawls up from under the house eaves, touching the injured spot that was kicked, and hobbles home in pain.</p>
<p>When the sun is peeking over the eastern mountain, small black crows are flying in the greyish white sky, the wind is cold and desolate, stray dogs run out of the alley, and the rooster has crowed three times.</p>
<p>Several policemen, wide awake from the cold, are running. Ah Wen is squeezed among them, his arms bound tightly behind his back.</p>
<p>"What law have I broken, officers!"</p>
<p>"Stop the nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Still pretending like nothing happened!"</p>
<p>"If you're timid, behave yourself, privately hoarding military firearms!"</p>
<p>Ah Wen lowers his head blankly, letting them carry him out of the alley. The shopkeeper of the oil and salt store wipes his eye boogers on the wooden door panel, and looks up for a while, saying:</p>
<p>"The tofu seller Ah Wen is in trouble!"</p>
<p>A vegetable peddler passes by and responds:</p>
<p>"I heard he's a traitor, has a gun, colluding with ×× people, don't know if it's true or false?"</p>
<h3>Raft House</h3>
<p>— Zhifu</p>
<p>Summer night, the bright moon hangs obliquely in the sky, and the river harbor is tranquil. The sound of water flows rhythmically. The footsteps on the embankment are relatively sparse at that time. The mosquitoes, however, become arrogant, gathering in the weeds, constantly stirring and destroying the calm air.</p>
<p>The water surface is peaceful. A row of wooden rafts is lined up on the left bank. Like a long snake, they lie lazily there. The raft house of the watchman, like a dragon's cub, is tied to the wooden raft, crouching and accompanying the quiet night.</p>
<p>Those trees, water plants... are reflected by the moonlight in the clear blue water, curling and rippling...</p>
<p>It is indistinguishable from which raft house this moving song comes from:—</p>
<p>"...In the second watch, the moon is east,</p>
<p>The moon is curved like a bow,</p>
<p>Shining on the poor man's raft house.</p>
<p>The poor man's fate is bitter!</p>
<p>The poor man's fate is locked in a cage.</p>
<p>For three meals a day, working for others.</p>
<p>Sweating and bleeding all year round,</p>
<p>Life cannot be relaxed at all...</p>
<p>When can we break free from the cage, break free from the cage!..."</p>
<p>The raftsman singing stretched his voice freely in the white night river harbor: seemingly intentionally sighing his own fate by the light of the bright moon.</p>
<p>The singing stopped for a while, and the air was silent again. Even the noises of those reptiles seem to be low. In the heart of the river, transparent white fog still spreads...</p>
<p>"Sun Lin!...Damn, monkey head! What are you learning from women's tunes,... it's simply... like a ghost crying!...Haha...it's simply..." Another bold voice rolled out from a raft house with a tin roof, sharply vibrating on the river harbor...</p>
<p>The raftsman Sun Lin, called the monkey head, sat leaning against the small window, staring blankly at the sky, as if he hadn't heard the drunken man's rude giant voice.</p>
<p>The sky is still flowing with bright white clouds, connected to the distant embankment and jungle, as if you can touch it with a single hand.</p>
<p>The raft house is filled with the smell of yellow wine, and the middle-aged raftsman He Geng is swallowing alone, moving his lips. This time, with seven points of drunkenness, he approached Sun Lin and slapped him heavily on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"What are you sad about?...Really like a monkey head pretending!...Okay! Let's be happy!...One day's work, damn!...Like cattle and horses...Look, when we get to the night, we like this little thing in the cup...Come! You and I drink a cup together..."</p>
<p>He grabbed Sun Lin's arm at random, entangled him fatefully. That uncomfortable smell of alcohol rushed out sharply from the wide mouth.</p>
<p>"Old Geng! Let you enjoy it alone! Greedy fellow...don't..."</p>
<p>Sun Lin frowned. He glared at him hatefully, broke free from Old Geng's grasp, lowered his eyes and looked at the swaying shadow in the river, watching it rise with an irregular curl and splashing apart...</p>
<p>"Monkey head!..."</p>
<p>A Geng flipped his eyelids and cursed heavily: Then, he rushed forward, preparing to reprimand him severely:</p>
<p>"Hey! Kid! Stop pretending, we...talking about fate,...the fate of us raftsmen,...is to suffer this lifetime...Which one is lucky?..."</p>
<p>Sun Lin was a little depressed. He suppressed his breath, unable to think of what words to argue with. He looked at the water shadow, then turned his eyes to look at the sky, and finally lowered his face again...</p>
<p>This time—Ah Geng finished muttering, and seemed to be a little sober from the alcohol, and his brain returned to its original state as usual, sympathizing, and looking at the sky with Sun Lin, his red and swollen eyelids tightly closed.</p>
<p>"Eh! We raft people sell our labor, what luck are we talking about!...My old partner!..."</p>
<p>There was no more sound to follow, and the raft house was silent.</p>
<p>Summer night, the bright moon hangs in the sky, floating clouds push in the sky, and the river harbor is still not quiet...</p>

<p>Opening "Sweeping Qin"</p>
<p>Don't laugh at my crazy, foolish, and dirty appearance. The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha intentionally descended to the mortal world. He borrowed a body to sit in meditation at Lingyin Temple. He wrote a poem on the wall to sweep away the Qin. The prime minister of the current dynasty came to offer incense. He held three sticks of incense in his hand. He lowered his head and silently communicated with the gods. He only hoped for favorable weather and prosperous harvests. He only sought that husband and wife might have long life. He blessed the Yue family's virtuous father and son. He wished for them to ascend to the immortal realm and be reborn early. He raised his head and suddenly saw the poem. The treacherous hero Zhan Lin was suddenly shocked. This poem was written with his wife. The painting reveals the fiery destruction of spring windows. He immediately angrily questioned and summoned the mad monk. Who knew he could utter Zen secrets and change endlessly? He could summon wind and call rain. He could use a fire hose to communicate with foreign countries. He also used a palm broom to sweep away good ministers. The storm arose only because of monopolized power. He died unjustly at the Cold Spring Pavilion. Upon returning home, the husband and wife discussed together. They shaved their heads and converted, abandoning fame and wealth. They listened to the slander of long-tongued women. They suffered the punishments of the hells of Fengdu. Now, they are covered in iron filings at Yue Wang's tomb.</p>

<p>Thin and bony, walking slowly. Only because of pear blossoms, my heart is foolish. Pear blossoms are, intending to report spring, buds grow. Now I, fearing the cold, have no intention of writing new words. Looking up at the mountain pass, my pen piles up. Pushing open the window, I see strands of rain. The fine rain soaks the flowers, the flowers seem drunk. The gentle breeze combs, Qing is like silk. Pear blossoms, your ice-jade skin is worthy of comparison. Keep yourself clean and forever persevere. You are because, your appearance only has three parts white left. Could it be, because you recite and sing flower-selling lyrics. Pear blossoms, how can a frown or smile be without</p>

<p>words. It must be, half shame and half foolishness. Today, don't be blown away by the east wind. Why does the east wind whip you so often? Pear blossoms, birds peck against the wind to cherish their feathers. Why are your petals blown by the wind onto the ink pond? It's hard to meet geese carrying letters. The ink pond reflects your shadow, comforting my thoughts. Pear blossoms, whose pity do you see for your haggard appearance? Only I cherish love here. Sweeping up the petals and putting them in my zither bag. Pity my heart, don't dislike my repetition. Crying over flowers, my tears have not yet stopped. Do flowers have feelings, who knows? Helpless, I close the window and quietly listen to the wind and bamboo sweeping the orchid mortise.</p>

<p>Movie</p>
<h3>Special Feature</h3>
<p>When filming the scene of You Guanren's drunkenness in "Little Sisters," You, in order to make the performance realistic, secretly drank several cups of sorghum liquor. Therefore, when filming began, he was already drunk, and the drunken scene thus achieved unexpectedly satisfactory results.</p>
<p>For the needs of the plot, "Little Sisters" inserted a scene of Ye Wenhuo emerging from a bath, which was both sensual and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3>Paris Refreshment Temporarily Suspends Screening</h3>
<p>The Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre has always been known as the leader among the theaters in western Shanghai. In order to strive for perfection, the theater has spared no expense and has undergone a major renovation, replacing it with a new type of projector and installing a truly scientific silver screen. Therefore, starting today (the 24th), it will temporarily suspend screenings for three days. After that, the Paris Theater will be as perfect as it can be, and can be used as the best recreational place for Shanghai residents. It is also heard that the theater has signed long-term contracts with major film companies in Shanghai, such as MGM, Paramount, Warner Bros., Universal, 20th Century Fox, and Columbia Pictures, to show any blockbuster movies in the second or third round, to satisfy your eyes. The opening film has been selected as Paramount's "Barbary Coast," a second-run film starring Herbert Marshall, the lead actor in "Waterloo Bridge," leading six major stars to work together on a great structure. The showtimes have also been changed to: 1:30, 5:00, 7:00, and 9:15, with prices remaining the same. The theater will meet with all Shanghai residents on the 27th of the month.</p>

<h3>"Begonia Red" and "Women's Rights"</h3>
<p>After producing "Peach Blossom After the Robbery," Zhang Shichuan successively produced two new films, one is "Begonia Red" and the other is "Women's Rights."</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's works rarely have delicate and fragmented descriptions. He always grasps the core of the play and completes his work in a bold manner. The story is narrated concisely and clearly, and the climax of the play is often very clearly presented. Sometimes he also appropriately adds some jokes. This is the superiority of his works.</p>
<p>"Begonia Red" is a performance that exhausts all joys and sorrows, sweet and bitter experiences. The story contains a very complex group of characters: a cowardly actress, a cruel child-exchanger, a licentious warlord and his sycophantic, manipulative henchmen, a kind and useless merchant, a heartbroken old man, a family of gentlemen, children searching for their mother, a loyal old servant... There are tears, there are smiles, there is anger, there is madness, there are sighs, there is ridicule, there are cries!</p>
<p>"Women's Rights" focuses on depicting the story of a woman, an intellectual woman who jumps out of the powdered and perfumed life circle of a young mistress. She begins to use her education to cultivate the barren land of society, but "love," a kind of thing, relentlessly besieges her. The so-called "women's status" is merely a vase in society. She begins to wander painfully everywhere, from the south of the Yangtze River to the northern country. She cannot enter society at all.
