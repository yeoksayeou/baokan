<h3>蔣院長元旦廣播講學　國民自救救國之要道（續）</h3>
<p>以新生活運動奠定國家道德精神之基礎以國民經濟建設運動促成物質文明進步由上所述、可知新生活運動、就是使全國國民樹立人格、以復興民族之革心的運動、所謂新生活、乃是以「禮義廉恥」的精神為凖據、以適應時代環境的需要為原則之合理的生活、我們是要從日常實際生活之中、實實在在來完成道德精神的修養、希望全國同胞、要依此目標、努力不懈、古人說、「苟日新、日日新、又日新、」意思是說在我們思想上精神上生活上、要滌除舊染的一切汚點、使能煥然一新、從而繼續不斷的求其一天一天的更新起來、以養成最高尙的精神和人格、講到這裏、我要順便吿訴各位同胞、我們所要實行的「新」生活、所謂「新」、和現在一般人所謂「摩登」或「時髦」、是絕對不同的、我們要實行新生活、絕對不是要求所吃的穿的住的用的一切物質上的享受要新奇、而是要不斷的澈底的改良我們的生活習慣行動等等、使我們的思想道德、精神和人格、「日新又新」、造成社會和全國明禮尙義守廉知恥之新的風氣、這種新的風氣、一旦養成、就可以建立新的社會、有了新的社會、自然就可以建立成新的國家、如此新的國家、才是眞正文明强盛的現代國家、管子說、「禮義廉恥、國之四維、四維不張、國乃滅亡、」我們再可以從正面的意思來講、「禮義廉恥、國之四維、四維旣張、國乃復興、」人家那怕是很小的國家、因為能够明禮義知廉恥、所以只要很短的期間、便可以由貧弱轉國富强、以至雄視於全世界、我們這樣大的國家、這樣多的同胞、更加以這樣悠久光榮的歷史、與優美偉大的文化、而且我們民族的聰明才力、比人家有過之而無不及、只要能復張四維、那裏還有不能立卽使國家臻於富强的道理、只要大家同心同德、一致實行新生活、人人做成現代的國民、使社會國家的風氣、一天新一天、一天進步一天、我們當然很容易建立起文明强盛的新國家、所以實行新生活、就是我們全體同胞自救救國的根本大道、</p>
<p>其次、除新生活運動以外、還有一件自救救國最緊要的事情、我們大家、務必從今天開始、特別努力來做的、是什麼呢、就是兄弟去年所提出來的「國民經濟建設運動」、這個運動、一定要和新生活運動、同時並進、相輔而行、新生活運動的目的、是要改良國民的生活習慣、從而增進國民的道德、發揚民族的精神、以改善國民的精神生活、而完成國家精神的建設、國民經濟建設運動的目的、是要發揮國民勞動創造的能力、增加國民生活的資料、從而改善國民的經濟生活、完成國家物質的建設、精神和物質兩種建設、是互相關連、互相影響、互相助成的、偏廢其一、則俱難成功、同時並進、則事半功倍、所以國民經濟建設運動與新生活運動、必須相轉而行、亦必然相得益彰、我們旣以新生活運動來奠定國家道德精神的基礎、同時再要以國民經濟建設運動來完成國家經濟的建設、促成物質文明的進步、才能够使國家健全發展、也才能救起國家、復興民族、因此希望全國同胞個個人要時時刻刻記着、這兩種運動、就是當前自救救國最緊要的中心工作、大家要同心恊力、自强不息的努力實行、我相信一定可以由此實現我們國父孫中山先生的三民主義、完成挽救國家復興民族的大業、</p>
<p>各位同胞要曉得、我們要救國家、就要革命、革命就是要實現三民主義、三民主義、是以「民生」為中心、民生的基礎是什麼、就是經濟、如果經濟不能發達、民生便無法改善、民生不能改善、三民主義便不能實行、所以我們要救國、要實現三民主義、一定先要努力國民經濟的建設、以改善民生、而國民經濟建設運動、就是我們全國國民努力國民經濟建設的基本途徑、希望我們全國國民一致努力、現在我再將國民經濟建設運動的實施要項和方法、和大家說一說、第一·振興農業、我們中國向來是以農立國、國民的生活、國家的生存、都是以農業為根基、所以我們要從事經濟的建設、第一件緊要的工作、就是振興農業、振興的方法、就是要採用農村合作的辦法、由合作社指導、並改進製肥選種、改良農作方法、活潑農村金融、流暢農產運銷、來努力增加農業生產、以達到糧食自給自足為初步目標、總使全國國民一切日常生活資料、不必再向外國購買、以塞漏巵、而免國計民生日趨凋敝、為達到這個目的起見、一方面要增加農業原料的生產量、以作發展民族工業的基礎、同時要提倡就地加工製造、使能廉價供給本地的需要、更可以减少運費供給各地、第二·鼓勵墾牧、土地是一切資料生產的根源、要發達生產、首須「地盡其利」、所以一切公私荒地、務必儘量開懇、對於地廣人稀的地方、更要鼓吹大規模的移民墾荒和經營畜牧、並且要實施軍區屯墾制、利用集團的勞力、大規模的開發種種的農利、此外更須恢復並增進農村的副產、例如家畜·園藝·漁利·之類、應竭力使能同時改良品質、增加產量、第三·開發礦產、總理說、「礦業為物質文明與經濟進步之極大主因」、幾十年來、我們中國物質文明和經濟建設之所以不能進步、礦業未能發達、當然是直接的最大的一個原因、過去因為政治·經濟·與社會各方面種種的阻礙、礦業可說是一事無成、以後政府必須採用積極的保護和獎勵的政策、調查礦業狀况、以及摧殘束縛礦業發展的原因、改善關於礦業的各種法規、總以减輕負担、便利開採、鼓勵礦業投資、扶助礦商之獨立經營和自由發展為主要目的、更當禁止地方政府與任何特殊勢力把持礦權、與民爭利、並且因為我們國家的資力不够、應當歡迎外國投資、共同發展中國的礦業、如此、一方面旣可容納大量的勞力、解决同胞失業的問題、同時便可以開發富源、促成物質文明的進步、第四·提倡徵工、徵工就是實行國民勞動服務以從事於國民經濟建設一個最急要的辦法、現在我們的國家貧窮、沒有充分的財力來完成各種建設事業、好在我們的同胞很多、同胞的勞力、就是國家最可寳貴的經濟動力、亦卽一切建設事業的資本、只要我們全國同胞能竭盡所能來勞動、便可以完成一切福國利民、自救救國的新建設事業、盡到國民對國家責任、古人所謂「以勞敎民富」又說「憂勞興國」、與我們所謂勞動服務、完全是一個道理、希望全國同胞、共體此意、大家贊助政府實施徵工制度、踴躍參加義務勞動、至少總要能以當地同胞的努力、首先從事當地開發交通、修治水利、培植森林、開墾荒地、這一類經濟建設的基本工作、除徵工制度以外、政府方面應同時實施兵工政策、以軍隊的勞力、補助各地徵工工務之不足、我相信各地一切建設事業、如得軍隊的帮助、一定可以得到事半功倍的效果、第五·促進工業、工業如不能發展、物質文明便不能進步、經濟生活便不能美滿、所以除極力促進農林礦業之外、最要緊的、更須極力謀工業的發達、我們中國舊式的手工業、旣已凋敝、新式的機械工業、因為受外國經濟的壓迫、也至今不能發達起來、現在要謀起衰振敝富國裕民的辦法、一方面對農村簡易的工業及農產品加工製造之簡單工業提倡、就農村或其附近、按合作系統經營、以謀農工業之密切連貫、交相發展、一面對於一般工業、由政府分別保護和獎勵、以求全國工業品之自給自足、同時並須設立勞資調節的機關、公平調處勞資雙方一切糾紛、增進雙方的利益、這種機關、一定要予以最後强制執行之權、藉以保障企業的安全和勞動者的工作、第六·調節消費、在我們這樣生產能力薄弱、一切生產事業落後的國家、各種生活資料異常缺乏、大半都要仰給於外國、因此造成農村資金集中都市、再轉流外國之經濟上的敗血症、以致農村經濟瀕於破產、一切產業、同時凋敝、國家日益貧困之最嚴重的經濟危機、補救之法、惟有標本兼治、一方面固然要在積極方面、以最大的努力、從根本上增進國民生產能力、發達全國產事業、同時更要在消極方面、以最大的努力、盡量節約消費、調劑供求、各位同胞要知道、節約消費、只在我們大家一轉念之間就可做到、比較增加生產要容易得多、但是這件事對於救國的功效、却與增加生產相等、如此輕而易舉切實有效的事、我們怎麼好不努力實行呢、總之、以後我們總要努力節約消費、調劑供求、防止內地與農村資金的耗溢、進一步達到對外貿易輸出入的平衡、第七·流暢貨運、流暢貨運的基本條件、在交通便利、所以我們要盡量發展全國各處的道路交通、改進水陸貨運的辦法、同時又要在各重要地區、設立主要農產品、如棉·麥·米·絲·茶·等的公共倉庫和運銷機關、以便屯積和轉運、第八·調整金融、金融為經濟的命脈、金融如失其正常狀態、一切產業都要蒙受惡劣的影響、所以調整金融、是國民經濟建設最基本最緊要的一項事情、講到調整金融的方法、在於鼓勵民間的儲蓄、活潑資金的融通、因應時代環境的要求、由政府執行健全的貨幣政策、全國國民要絕對信任政府、一致擁護實行、</p>
<p>以上八項、就是國民經濟建設運動的主要工作、其中有很多都是很簡明切實輕而易舉的事情、無論那一個人都能做、如果全國國民能够共同一致依照這些道理實實在在去做、我相信不僅我們各人自己的生活、可以因此趨於安定、而且整個經濟的國難、也可以迅速突破、使國家日趨於富强之域、否則國民經齊、無由建設、民生問題、無法解决、大家只有一天天的貧困、甚至多數國民弄得飢寒交迫、生活不能安定、那末、社會國家、就只有更加紛亂危險、不能得救了、所以大家要深切認識、這種運動、是當前自救救國最緊要的一件工作、從今天起、要一致奮發、努力實行、同時要擁護並督促政府竭力實做、如此、我們國家、就可以由這幾項基本的工作、立卽挽救起來、大家總要曉得、我們聰明才力、和外國人一樣健全、而我們的人口、比那一國都多、他們做五年十年的事情、我們如果同心恊力、一年就可以做成功、所以我們不怕國家怎樣貧弱、怎樣危險、只怕自己有了聰明的腦筋、和偉大的力量、而不肯用、不知道盡量發揮、只怕我們的同胞仍舊沒有國家民族的觀念、不明白自己的責任、不盡自己的義務、不守紀律、不能合羣、尤其是對於一切事情、不能實實在在來「做」、不做、當然什麼事也不會成功、能做、我想世界上就沒有什麼眞正難的事情、現在國家已經到了這樣危急存亡的地步、我們要能自救救國、惟有我們四萬萬同胞一方面推行新生活運動、使個個人成為現代的國民、以建設國家精神的基礎、一方面更要羣策羣力、來推行國民經濟建設運動、使個個人盡到勞動的義務、發揮民族生產的能力、建設國家物質的基礎、如此心物並重、體用兼備的兩種運動、就是實行三民主義最重要的方法、也就是我們全國同胞自救救國最切實的要道、希望大家從今天起、各發宏願、努力實行、尤其是知識階級的人、特別要負起領導的責任、以身作則、悉力倡導、務使全國國民、循此途徑、共同一致來做自救救國的工作、我們四萬萬同胞、都是一個祖宗一脈相傳的子孫、都是骨肉之親、應同手足之愛、大家休戚相關、禍福一致、當此國家生死存亡的關頭、惟有一心一德、自强自立、精誠團結、擁護中央、向救國的總目標努力前進、什麼外患都不怕、什麼危險都可以打破、三民主義、一定可以由我們手裏實現、中華民國一定可以挽救、中華民族一定可以復興、如此、我們個人才說得上是現代的國民、盡到了我們中華民國國民繼往開來的重大責任、才可以對得起列祖列宗、可以安慰我們國父孫中山先生在天之靈、今天兄弟和我們全國同胞所說的、就是這幾句話、希望各位同胞、一致奮勉、積極努力做到、恭祝各位健康、成功、再恭祝我們中華民國萬歲、萬歲、萬萬歲、（完）</p>

<h3>五國代表集倫敦　海會今日重開</h3>
<p>量的限制勢難妥恊</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議自上年十二月二十日休會後、茲定於本月六日復會、美日意三國代表團前在他處度歲、頃已返抵此間、復會之時一切工作、無須加以深長之準備、故各國代表大都得於今明兩日抽暇玩高爾夫球、以資消遺、各代表團均以為復會後之談判、務須積極進行、「量的限制恊定是吾有成立之可能、務須從速加以確定、苟其不能成立、則當討論質的限制問題、一般人以為如任何恊定不能實現、則海軍會議卽將迅速結束」云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍軍縮會議、依豫定於六日再開、議長將由新外相艾登就任、在休會中、並未發見何等妥恊之曙光、故恐最后决裂之速、在意想之外云、（四日電通電）</p>
<h3>美女議員反對　日本人造絲輸菲島</h3>
<p>華盛頓　共和黨衆議院羅傑斯女士今日反對日本人造絲輸往菲列賓羣島、聲稱應與紡織品有同樣之限制、羅女士已要求國務院設法控制日本人造絲在菲島之競爭、尤以自中國轉運至菲之日本人造絲及日商在華製造之人造絲為甚云、（四日國民社電）</p>
<h3>德將在菲島設駐使</h3>
<p>柏林　菲律濱業於上年十一月十五日、成立自治政府、德國聞將於最短時期之內、設立駐馬尼刺公使一缺、首任公使、大的將以前駐紐約總領事基卜升任、按上年十月間、德國派遺經濟調查團前往遠東考察、基卜卽屬團員之一、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福言論　旨在促進和平</h3>
<p>反對侵略側重意日行動修改國際條約門戶未閉</p>
<p>華盛頓　外交界及國務院方面今日咸以為羅斯福總統之咨文、實為威爾遜總統要求國會對德宣戰以來、美國總統對於外交方面最强硬之聲明、據悉羅總統之言論、係為促進中立法而作、外交界相信總統意中所指者、為意國對阿·日本對華之行動、及德國之重整軍備、並公開提議西半球國家之聯合、以謀世界和平云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間觀察者今日以為羅斯福總統已由其對於國會所提之咨文、恊助對意通過油禁之可能、並已對於不事侵略之國家予以鼓勵、政府某發言人稱、「羅總統之咨文固然為避免糾紛、惟亦明白宣示美國將以其世界上極大之權力、反對謀作新征服之國家」云、此間並以為總統並未關閉以和平方法修改條約之門戶云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　政府某發言人今日聲稱、彼完全贊同羅斯福總統之咨文、「實為要求鎭靜的理智之呼聲」云、法國報紙對於羅總統批評獨裁政治之言論、均有良好之批評、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>各國觀感不同</h3>
<p>羅馬惶慮德報譏評巴黎方面表示同情</p>
<p>巴黎　據羅馬消息、羅總統之演詞已引起意國對美國或將减少運意油量之惶慮、意國今大賴美國供給其繼續戰爭所需之油、若美國將對意之油供給减至戰前之數字、則意國將大受妨害、惟許多意人以為若美國承認汽油若干可運濟交戰國之原則、則殊難限制其額量云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　官方對於美國羅斯福總統日昨在國會所發表之演詞、並未有所聲明、惟聞此間對於此項演詞、大抵均表贊同之意、蓋羅斯福總統明言煤油一物、在戰爭時期仍將允其在平時正常輸出限度之內照常輸出、故一般人以為美國此項態度、將使全世界一致禁運煤油之舉、難於實現、此外倫敦傳來消息、謂英國政府對於加緊制裁之舉、不擬在國聯會方面率先倡導、此項消息遂使禁油不可能之希望、益為濃厚、抑猶有進者、美油輸入意國之數量、僅當意國輸入煤油總量六分之一、目下意國煤油之供給、合併有貯國內與已向他國訂購之數量而計、已極充裕、以之應付未來事變、自屬無虞、卽使遇有特殊事故、消費量超過平時、而單恃美油通常限額之輸入、實亦足敷應用矣云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間各方對於美國羅斯福總統日昨在國會發表之演說、均有批評、半官式外交政治通訊報謂、「美國不欲乘他國發生戰爭之際、坐收漁翁之利、此其政策、與德國於意阿戰事爆發以來所採取之態度、不謀而合」云、政界人士則重視該國國會復會後提出討論之新中立法案、謂此項法案、足以代表戰時中立法之一種新觀念、卽凡在交戰國不論其孰為戎首、一律待遇是也、至羅斯福總統演詞中、所謂「外國之獨夫政治者、役使人民而驅之於疆塲之上」一語、則各報對之、均不着一字之褒貶、惟國社黨機關報「攻擊」報綴以評語曰、「玩羅斯福總統之語氣、似眞正道德上之良心、惟在美國民主政治旗幟之下庶幾有之、而世間行使獨夫政治之諸國、則不過如威脅全世界之炸彈而已、抑知英美兩國、恒取蘇俄之史丹林·德國之希特勒·意國之墨索里尼·以與世界抱民治思想之人物相比儗、謂其背道而馳、不容並論、此其見解、幾於風行一時、卽此一端、足證英美兩國對於一切不落英美法窠臼之政治制度、實猶未明瞭其眞實之性質也」云云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　美國羅總統在國會發表之演詞、含有若干國家摧殘民治輿論與暴露專斷侵略精神之意、柏林外部發言人今日加以批評、謂羅總統此言、必非對德而發、因德國未有舉動可使羅總統發此言也、德國之狄克推多制與他國完全不同、想羅總統發言時其心中所感想者、定屬他國云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　羅總統致國會之演說、已引起德報之憤懣、如安格里夫報指該文殊屬可笑、足證美國對獨裁各國之眞相、所知甚屬膚淺、又謂國社黨政府巳與波蘭商獲諒解、並放棄與法國彼此一切土地上要求、及與英國商妥海軍的諒解云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　羅斯福總統致國會之演詞中、含有詆責墨索里尼狄克推多制之意、法人閱之、殊為喜悅、現多以羅總統之文將有何勢力及於日內瓦對意油禁之决議為問、時報謂制裁派將益振振有詞、辯論報謂美國中立案之實施、將使凱洛格非戰公的淪為嘲笑之具、而極有利於以戰爭為其主要實業之各國云（五日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　時報頃批論美國大總統羅斯福對於該國國會所宣讀之咨文、據云、「今後世界有事之際、匪特不能以合理之態度、預期美國出而干涉、與其他執干戈以衛護公理自由之各國、携手合作、一如歐戰時之所為、抑且依照戰時中立法之精神、凡為維護權利爭取獨立生存而從事戰爭之國家、以及志存獵取人國、以從事侵略之國家、亦均不能依恃美國供給軍火、卽繼續戰爭所必需之原料品、亦無從仰給於美國、此其局勢、足使今後一切自衛或攻擊之戰爭、大為改觀、舉世諸國、處斯情勢之下、自不得不在內國工業方面、善自策劃、俾在有事之秋、前此唯美國產品之是賴者、今後務當別闢蹊徑、此自足以鼓舞各國、勵行自給自足政策、其力量之宏、匪可言喩、此外又有一影饗、卽在戰爭之時、美國原料品之仰給旣不足恃、則其他出產原料之國家、尤其是蘇俄、自屬有利可圖矣」云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美中立新法案　較具有伸縮性</h3>
<p>賦總統以廣大權力視侵略國程度而施</p>
<p>華盛頓　衆議院外交委員會主席麥克雷諾爾、昨向衆議院提出新中立法案、擬將現行法加以修正、俾成為永遠中立法、據此間政界人士觀察、此案通過之後、羅斯福總統將如何予以解釋、並予以實施、可由總統昨日向國會所發表之演詞、窺見一斑、按麥克雷諾爾所提新中立法案、主張以「便宜行事」之廣泛權力、畀予總統、此與現行中立法之具有嚴格「命令」性者（卽指不得不採取之措置而言）迴不相同、按照新案、各種非純粹戰爭用具而可用於戰爭之物品、如煤油銅棉之類、應吾禁止運往交戰國家、得由總統便宜决定之、總統之得以運用此項權力、以擴大禁運物品淸單者、卽所以「保障美國安全、維持美國中立、並避免戰爭之擴大並延長」、蓋一旦國際間發生衝突、美國總統旣具便宜行事之權力、而於運用之際、又能屈伸自如、此其關係實極重要、關於此層、總統曾在演詞中對於「具有侵略性之獨夫政治」痛加貶斥、謂醞釀戰事危險之責任、當僅由此等國家負之、其詞氣實至嚴峻、反之、其對於「始終忠守民主主義之國家」、則謂愛護和平者卽係此等國家、細繹總統語意、實恐歐洲與遠東兩處、或將發生戰事、故將未來之「侵略國」先予以揭發也、由是觀之、一旦國際間發生戰爭之際、羅斯福總統自將分別交戰國責任之重輕、以為實施中立法範圍廣狹之標準、對於侵略國、自當嚴格行施中立法之全部條例、不稍寬假、其於被攻擊之國家、則將僅實施中立法以「命令」或所規定之措置、而不及其他也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　關於美國總統羅斯福日前在國會所發表之演說、此間接得詳細情報之後、負責方面頃對該國國會討論中之新中立法案、多加以評騭、蓋此輩所重視者為該法案本身、而非羅斯福之演說、第一以該法案足以表現美國人民切望保持中立、並以全力維護和平、其次、由該案條文而觀、美國傳統之海洋自由觀念或有修正之可能、該案如獲通過、則將以新特權賦予總統、俾得於現行中立法所規定之禁運軍火一層之外、擴大禁運物品淸單、將總統所認為足使交戰國延長戰禍之物品、一併加以禁運、職是之故、當局或有實施海軍封鎖之可能、並使封鎖效力、推及於本國之船舶、此其結果、自能使中立法案發生實效、且此舉如成事實、則對於日內瓦方面之行動或將發生重大影響、蓋以國聯會盟約第十六條之實施或亦將採用海軍封鎖之形式、以對付侵略國也、但關於此層、英國迄今猶未敢輕於一試、良以萬一美國緊持海洋自由之主張、不免因而引起兩國間之糾葛耳、但如美國新中立法一旦吿成、則此項困難自能迎刃而解、惟國令對於某一種禁運辦法或能表决展緩施行、因而美總統對交戰國雙方所擬施行之禁運辦法或將感受影響、亦未可知、以上為官塲人士對於新中立法案大體上表示之意見、其對於意阿戰爭之關係、則不願下斷語云、査美國現行中立法、係去年九月一日成立、至本年二月底滿期、僅規定對交戰國禁運軍用品、現由衆院外交委員會主席麥克雷諾爾於三日向衆院提出新法案、（內容已詳見昨電）（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國會之議程</h3>
<p>中立案將迅付討論預算收支未能平衡</p>
<p>華盛頓　參院多數黨議程委員會今日已决定趕速進行退伍軍人恩給金及中立二案、該會已授權參議員羅賓生與羅斯福總統會商、以謀對於恩給金案得一妥恊辦法、並授權參議員畢德門、於星期三以中立案提出外交委員會、（四日國民電）</p>

<h3>談紅葉（續）</h3>
<p>— 張楚</p>
<p>春季所見的紅葉多屬初生的嫩葉，常見的如槭屬（Acer）石南屬（Rhododendron）黃連木等植物，這種嫩葉變紅的目的，據多數學者的意見，以為其意義在遮蔽過强的日光，以保護幼嫩的組織。因為日光固然是植物生活上所必要的動力，但各種植物各有其一定之需光量，卽各有一定之最適度（Optimun）是·倘若光度太强超過最適度，或光度太弱不及最適度，都反有害于植物體的生活，春季樹木往往呈紅色或淡紅色的新葉的原故，卽為阻止過度强光的射入，免其葉綠素因而分解。至於秋季紅葉又作何解釋呢？解釋秋季葉變紅的道理有兩種恰相反對的學說：第一說謂紅色花靑素有二項功能（一）紅色可以遮蔽有害植物的强光，使葉內的化學變化可以順序進行，不發生障碍，這和解釋春季葉紅之理正同。（二）紅色能自光綫中的赤色光綫多多吸收熟量，增高葉內的溫度，促進化學的變化，換句話說，就是使葉裏面的重要化合物質得完全分解，輸送到莖裏去，貯藏起來，免隨着秋冬落葉而損失掉。但另外一說則全然不同，此說謂紅色的葉子，不過是植物體因季候變化所起的一種生理反應而已，對于植物體的本身並無絲毫的利益，為什麽要這樣，實在並沒有多大的意義，其所以在凋落之前，放出美麗的色彩的原因，猶如日落西山前的迴光反照而己，和花之顯示美色為了引誘昆虫的目的，實全然不同。二說孰是孰非，可以說還沒有一種定論。</p>
<p>通常人們每把紅葉和楓葉相混，幾乎以為凡紅葉皆是楓葉，實則葉紅的並不止楓葉，黃連木，三角楓，掌葉槭，鷄爪槭，茶條，烏柏，石楠，櫻花，南天竹，奴柘，山槐，樺，等也都常見的秋季紅葉的樹種，我們現在特提出幾種，簡單的圖示它們葉子的形狀，免得以後再見到紅葉便以為是楓葉了。</p>
<p>（一）楓</p>
<p>楓樹一名楓香，又稱路路通，屬金縷梅科，這是眞正的楓樹，常長成很大的喬木，葉互生，果子是一個個下垂的刺狀球果。</p>
<p>（二）三角楓</p>
<p>別稱楓檀屬槭樹科，農家多植成藩籬用，少大樹，它和（一）最易相混，不過三角楓的葉是對生的果是翅果，都和楓大不相同的。</p>
<p>（三）烏柏</p>
<p>烏柏在江浙頗多，葉心臟形，很容易辨別，它的果實裂開來看見三粒白色蠟質包圍的種子，種觀。子榨油可以製燭，製肥皂，燃燈等用，葉也可以作黑絲染料。</p>
<p>（四）石楠</p>
<p>石楠在墳墓上栽植的很多，樹形渾圓，很美觀，葉厚，邊緣有細刺，秋冬一部變紅，極鮮艷。</p>
<p>（五）黃連木</p>
<p>這是一種複葉，小葉的基部歪斜不對稱，春日開葉色紅艷如黃鸝之頭，嫩葉有芳香可以代茶，有鹽醃製成黃連茶出售者，山東稱楷樹，傳曲阜孔廟孔子像卽用此種木材製成。</p>
<p>（六）最後再介紹一種最美麗的紅葉，卽鷄爪槭是。也屬于槭樹科，翅果，葉七裂，新葉和秋葉變紅，壓展在書裏鑲入鏡框，絕美。另有一種葉五裂的，也頗美觀。</p>

<h3>日本財政恐慌</h3>
<p>國債與地方債逐年加增跛行財政促致跛行經濟</p>
<p>華聯社特稿　一國財政的安整或恐慌、就是一國經濟現象良惡的反映、這裏可以從日本財政恐慌的情形、看出日本經濟的危機、</p>
<p>自從一九三一年九一八事件以來、日本無理的膨大財政的結果、財政狀况疲憊到萬分、眼看着這新吞併了的滿洲、苦於無資可投、據說要恢復秩序、四年來用下的特別費、却更增加日本國財政上的不安、</p>
<p>說到國債、則由一九三一年九月的五十萬萬五千萬元、變為去年八月的九十七萬萬六千四百萬元、若再加上財部證券五千萬元、米穀證券五萬萬二千八百萬元、那末、四年以來、祗就中央政府方面的公債說、已經就由六十一萬萬八千七百萬元、增加到一百三萬萬四千二百萬元、有了四十一萬萬五千五百萬元的增加、</p>
<p>再看地方債、則在一九三一年是十六萬萬八千五百萬元　到去年六月增加到二十四萬萬四千七百萬元、卽有了七六·二％的增加、卽是說、日本財政上的公債、總額已經增加到五十多萬萬元了、這五十多萬萬元的公債、是强行分配於銀行、再轉駕御到日本勞苦大衆已不能支持着了的担子上面、一九三一年末、銀行金庫所存尙不過為十八萬萬一千一百萬元的國債額、但在去歲七月、驟加到四十一萬萬四千六百萬元、再須加上四萬萬四千三百萬元的地方債及保險公司在國債所投入的巨額資本等、數目更是可觀、</p>
<p>看看日本存欵部的存欵、近數年來實在是增加了、但那新舊存欵的增加、却都是任由國庫挪用於國債的增加、連政府的各種企業債券、也都被納入於存欵部金庫之中、存欵總額約三十二萬萬元、却被投作政府有價證券的資本金、數額是三十五萬萬元、連凖備金也都被挪用了去、總而言之、在日本金融團體的金庫中、聚集着的公債竟約在一百二十八萬萬圓左右、至於日本各銀行資金的大部分、也是被吸收在其他的有價證券裏面、去年七月投入日本民間銀行公司的股票及債票的投資、是二十四萬萬四百萬元、信用公司五萬萬九千六百萬元、保險公司八萬萬元、約計日本全金融資本的三分之二、是在各種有價券中凝結着、有價證券這種汜濫的情形、就是日本財政緊迫的說明、而且一般的狀况、債券的價値、則表示着繼績的低降、還有日本鈔票通貨的膨脹、舉一個例子、在一九二一年九月、白銀的鈔票發行額、是十萬萬五千四百萬元、到了去年七月、則增加到十二萬萬二百萬元、鮮銀發行額從一萬萬元增到一萬四千七百萬元、台銀發行額從四千四百萬元增加到四千五百萬元、這種增加不等的情形、更是日本財銀家自身間利益衝突的焦點、</p>
<p>本年日本財政預算案編成前、高橋藏相緊持着不再加公債了、取「兵財兩全主義」、但結果一般會計預算歲出總額二十二億七千八百萬元中、陸海軍事費竟佔十億五千九百萬元、卽成為歲出總額的四成六分五厘、卽本年度的軍事費、比較去年更增加了三千八百萬元、另一方面、頻於破產恐慌念需補救的農林省費、則在昭和九年度為一億二千三百萬元、至去年（昭和十年）减為九千三百萬元、而本年度更减為九千萬元、</p>
<p>這樣、日本跛行的財政、乃就更促成跛行經濟的澈化、止有一部份的軍需產業、得到了一點小潤澤、大部份的農村經濟與中小工商業者、勞苦大衆、乃更陷入於困苦的泥沼之中、日本財政的恐慌、已經充分指出日本經濟的危機、說明日本內部的實力、實在是空虛到極點了、</p>

<h3>福州商業危機</h3>
<p>三行借欵範圍尙小東南復業恐難實現一等綢店突吿倒閉</p>
<p>福州通訊、本市商界、前因年關結賬、銀根吃緊、請求設立商業公庫、發行流通券、財政部以與禁止發行私幣法令抵觸、不准所請、令由福州中央·中國·交通·三銀行、撥欵一百萬元、救濟商塲金融、省府主席陳儀回閩後、對於此事、特召集中中交三行長到府、商洽救濟辦法、决定由省政府·縣商會·三銀行·各推舉三人、組織金融維持委員會、辦理借欵事宜、凡商家需要欵項者、可提出不動產、請求該委員會評定價格、向銀行押借欵項、但名義雖為產價十成、借欵五成、實際不動產照最低時價僅能評至八成借額最高僅能押至四成左右、故若全恃押產借欵周轉、仍不能濟事、僅能作為一部分之輔助、商家因需欵孔急、極盼該委員會早日成立、現聞委員人選、省府有擬徐桴·陳體誠·林知淵、商會有擬羅勉侯·陳培錕·洪發綏、銀行卽由三行行長充任之說、但該委員會成立後、尙須另組評價委員會、專門辦理評估房屋價格事宜、故最快亦須至廢曆十二月望後、方能開辦、</p>

<p>商塲情形、因結賬期間愈迫、活動亦愈感困難、其中尤以綢布蘇廣兩帮、最為枯竭、因該兩帮商店、以市景蕭條、於夏秋之間、賒入大批貨物、舉行大廉價、藉以維持門面、現屆年關、無欵還賬、皆搖搖欲動、昨台江汎永華細布莊、已首先倒閉、負債二萬餘元、査台江汎為本市綢布蘇廣商店集中之區、平日表面極為繁華、內中空虛已極、永華為當地一等商店、僅差二萬元、竟吿倒閉、則別家受其影饗、難免牽動、故在此二十餘日中、實為福州商業重大危機之時也、</p>

<h3>國語科講演　怎樣寫作（續）</h3>
<p>— 開明書店編輯　葉紹鈞</p>
<p>從前人學作文章都注重在誦經，往往說只要把幾十篇文章讀得爛熟，自然而然能够下筆成文了。這個話好像含有神秘性，說穿了道理也很平常，原來就是鍜鍊語言習慣的意思。文言不同於口頭語言，非但所用的詞兒不同，一部分的語句組織也大有不同。要學寫不同于口頭語言的文言，除了學習這種特殊的語言習慣以外，沒有別的方法，而誦讀就是學習這種特殊的語言習慣的一種鍜鍊，所以，丟開了旁的方面不講，單講從前人從誦讀學作文章的方法，那是不錯的，諸位現在要學作文言，我想也應該從熟讀文言入手。不過我以為諸位實在沒有寫作文言的必要，說語體淺文言深，先習語體復習文言，正是由淺入深，這種說法實在毫沒有道理。文章的淺深該從內容和技術來决定，不在乎文體的是語體還是文言，內容好，表達的技術也好，雖然語體也是深的，內容壞，表達的技術也壞，雖然文言也是淺的。况且我們旣是現代的人，要表達我們的思想情感，在口頭當然用現代的語言，在筆下當然用按照口頭語言寫下來的語體。能寫語體，我們已經有了最便利的工具，為什麽還要去學習一種不切實用的文言？若說在升學考試或其他考試的時候，所出國文題目之下往往有加上一個括弧，拒弧裏面寫着「限用文言」四個字的，所以不得不事前預備。這實在由於主持考試的人太不明白，我們希望他們漸漸通達起來，在最近的將來再不要作這種故意同人家為難而毫沒有實際意義的事。而在這種事實還沒有絕跡以前，諸位為升學計，為通過其他考試計，就只得分出一部分工夫來，勉力去學寫文言。</p>
<p>以上說了許多的話，無非說明要寫通順文章，最要緊的是鍜鍊我們的語言習慣。因為我們認定文章就是語言的紀錄，二者本是同一的東西，可是還得進一步，我們寫文章，又不能不知道文章和語言兩樣的地方。前面已經說過，開口說話的時候，有面部的表情和身體的姿勢作為帮助，但是文章沒有這種帮助，　就是兩樣的地方。知道有道一層，我們寫起文章來就得特別留意，怎樣適當地寫，才可以不靠這種帮助而同樣可以使人家明白。兩樣的地方又豈止這一層呢？以下我們再來說一些，譬如兩個人閒談，往往從南天談到北地，結尾和開頭竟可以毫不相關。就是正當討論一個問題，商量一件事情，在中間也有時加入一段挿話，像藤蔓一樣爬開去，爬得完全離開了本題，直到一個人省悟了，說：「我們還是談正經話吧，」這才一刀截斷，重又回到本題上去，作文章就不能這樣。文章大部分是預備給人家看的，小部分是留給自己將來查考的，每一篇都有一個中心，沒有中心就沒有寫作的必要，所以寫作時候，只該把有關中心的話寫進去，而且要配到得非常周妥，使中心完全顯露出來，至於那些漫無限制的隨意話，像藤蔓一樣爬開去的枝節話，都該剔除得乾乾凈凈，不讓他浪費我們的筆墨。又如用語言講述一件事情，往往嚕嚕囌囌，細大不捐，如果傳述一場對話，更要一是一二是二地照樣述說，甲說什麽，乙說什麽，甲又說什麽，乙又說什麽，作文章就不能這樣，文章為求寫作和閱讀雙方的省事，最要講究經濟，把緊要的話都漏掉，一篇文章沒有顯露出什麽中心來，這算不經濟，必須把緊要的都寫了進去，此外再沒有一句嚕囌的話，正像善於用錢一樣，不該省錢的地方决不妄省，不該費錢的地方也决不妄費一個錢，這才彀得上稱為經濟。在這個條件之下，叙述一件事情就得注意詳略的方法，對於事情的經過不作同等分量的叙述，必須敎人家詳細明白的部分不惜費許多的筆墨，不必敎人家詳細明白的部分就一筆帶過。如果記載人家的對話就得注意選擇的工夫，對於人家的語言不作照單全收的記載，足以顯示其人的思想，識見性情等等的才讓他入選，否則就無妨丟開，又如我們口頭說話，往往用本土的方言以及本土語言的特殊調子。作文章就不這樣。文章得看讀者的籍貫，如果一篇文章，預備給各地的人看，就該把各地通行的語彙和語調用進去，僅僅通行於本土的語彙和語調必須完全淘汰，才可以不發生隔閡的弊病。以上說的都是文章和語言兩樣的地方。知道了這幾層，也就知道了作文技術的大槪。由知識漸漸成為習慣，於是作起文來有記錄語言的便利而沒有死板地記錄語言的缺點了。</p>
<p>現在來一個結束。怎樣寫作呢？最要的是鍛鍊我們的語言習慣。語言習慣良好，所寫文章就通順了，其次要辨明白文章和語言兩樣的地方，辨得明白，能知能行，所寫文章就不但通順，而且是完整而無可指摘的了。（完）</p>

<h3>縣公安局　敬吿自新烟民</h3>
<p>上海縣公安局、以本年二月一日起、為禁</p>
<p>烟總檢舉之期、欲使烟民明瞭意義起見、</p>
<p>特發表敬吿自新烟民書、以期及早覺悟、</p>
<p>茲探錄原文如下、諸位總應該知道了、我</p>
<p>們中國現在的地位、已到最危急最困難</p>
<p>的時期了、實在造成這種結果的最大原</p>
<p>因、是鴉片流毒、所以政府下此毅然决然</p>
<p>的决心、限期禁絕烟毒、絕對不再事姑</p>
<p>息、所定的禁烟法令、非常的嚴厲、非常</p>
<p>的利害、對於無照私吸和戒後重吸的烟</p>
<p>犯、要處很嚴重的刑罰、說不定要有遭死</p>
<p>刑的可能、本來一個人吸食了鴉片毒物、</p>
<p>就要戕生短命、傾家蕩產、弄得三分像人</p>
<p>七分像鬼、述很好的親戚朋友、都看不起</p>
<p>了、很密切的父母妻子、都不理會了、卽</p>
<p>使政府不禁、吸烟究竟有何趣味、况在如</p>
<p>是法網密布的狀况之下、何苦還要自作</p>
<p>孽呢、本省是從去年實行有效的禁烟以</p>
<p>來、現在戒烟執照已發到第三期了、中間</p>
<p>不少有志氣的烟民、已經完全戒絕、脫離</p>
<p>了黑籍痛苦、恢復淸白的良民、這果然是</p>
<p>一種很良好現象、但是還有許多烟民、因</p>
<p>為在總登記時候有種種的綠故、沒有向</p>
<p>政府登記、領照戒烟、政府方面、亦很明</p>
<p>白、茲為體恤這一般很可憐的沒有登記</p>
<p>的烟民起見、規定二十五年一月一日起、</p>
<p>至月底為止、為自新烟民登記的期間、在</p>
<p>這個期間內、能够立志戒絕、當然是最好</p>
<p>的機會、如果因為疾病、或是年老一時不</p>
<p>能戒絕的話、向政府繳納了第三期照費、</p>
<p>卽可不受無照私吸之刑罰、如果還要執</p>
<p>迷不悟、限期一滿、自二月一日起、就要</p>
<p>實行總檢舉了、我們公安機關為要盡泰</p>
<p>行法令的責任、老實不客氣的、實行拘捕</p>
<p>、絕對不能寬縱的、希望沒有領照戒烟的</p>
<p>烟民、趕快注意、趁這自新登記的機會、</p>
<p>回頭是岸吧、</p>

<p>（一）四川　四川在過去二十餘年中、政治黑暗、已逹極點、自去年省府改組後川省一切情形、在中央指導之下、已漸上軌道、惟因連年兵燹社會經濟、完全破產、故各級敎育經費、旣甚拮据、設備又極簡陋、茲分述之、（甲）四川大學、過去辦理不佳、無庸諱言、自任鴻雋奉令長校後、即銳意改進、如對專任敎授之延聘課程之充實、圖書之添購、尤為努力、現中央為、使該校成為西南最高學府、培養人才起見、特撥經費二百六十萬元從事建築校舍及各種科學研究之設備、故川大前途極可樂觀、其次如私立華西大學辦理尚好、而尤以牙科最著名、該校所附設之博物館、搜羅亦富、至重慶大學、自胡庶華接辦后、亦漸有進步、（乙）四川中學校、現有二百七十餘校、數字雖多、但經費不定、設備甚簡、且有因辦理中學致將初等敎育經費移挪者、故有數縣設立之中學、竟比完全小學為多、此種畸形發展、余已與敎廳擬定標準、設法改進、（丙）四川小學敎育辦理甚壞、因過去地方治安不佳、經費缺乏所致、欲圖進步非謁力設法整理不可、至於短期小學現已呈報設立者、僅有九十餘縣、尚有五十餘縣、仍付缺如、蓋因中央此次所發補助費雖有十四萬元、而省庫則分文未籌、地方則僅以廢局改科所剩餘之一點行政費、廢辦短期小學、而此數又微且不確實也余曾與該省當局會商、請即設法籌措、督促各縣迅速設立短期小學、以符中央功令、</p>
<p>（二）貴州　貴州地瘠民貧、兼之　去統治者、極端搜刮、社會經濟、凋敝不堪設想、自去年省府改組、一切事業、始有頭緒、現敎廳對於全省敎育設施、已有計劃、至其各級敎育情形可分述如下、（甲）黔省現無高等敎育之可言至於中等敎育、學校設備極壞、各中等學校（均少有學生寄宿舍、其他可想而知、兼之人才缺乏、敎員竟有在數校兼課、鐘點每週多至三十六點以上者、現省立中學、只有在省會的、共經費由敎廳支給、至外縣省立中學、名雖號稱省立、但經費則由數縣合籌、現余與敎廳商量結果、對於各中學學生宿舍務須分期建築、充實設備對於兼課敎員、則須從嚴取締、對於各縣省立中學經費、應設法由省庫負担、所餘經費則分還各縣辦理初級敎育、（乙）貴州小學尤不發逹、敎員待遇甚低、至於短期小學經中央補助十六萬元、省府亦自籌十四萬七千元、（苗民敎育經費在內）該省即以此項經費辦理短期小學六百一十五所、每校規定二百五十元另辦一個義敎實騐區、因為短期小學敎育待遇、較普通小學為高、且有的欵、故短期小學辦理尚好、（丙）貴州漢苗雜處、苗民人數、約合全省人口之三分之一以上自蔣委員長在黔提倡苗民敎育以來、現敎廳亦已擬定計劃、除短期小學兼收苗民兒童外、並擇該省苗民居住最多之處、如荔波·丹江·水城等地、共設省立小學六所、專收苗民、另設鄉村師範一所、專為訓練辦理苗民敎育之師資、在此校內并附有初中部以為苗民子弟有志升學之塲所、現均積極進行、此種敎育目的、首在打破漢苗之隔閡、使其能與漢人同受敎育、俾得潛移默化、收效於無形惟苗族學生之生活情况、習慣語言、均與漢人逈異、故對於課程及敎材、應如何斟酌損益實有待吾人之研究也、</p>

<h3>中西慈善足球賽　中華昨二比三受挫　上半時二比零佔先西聯連中三隻　俞鴻鈞代巿長開球觀眾盛極一時</h3>
<p>一年一度之中西慈善足球賽、昨日下午三時在申園交鋒、由巿長吳鐵城氏代表俞秘書長鴻鈞行開球禮、兩隊球員、均集全巿精華、吸引力强盛、午鐘方過、即有不少觀眾、絡繹向申園進發、三時將屆、南北兩看臺上早已座元隙地、約計之不下四五千人、盛况空前、角逐結果、中華隊不幸以三對二慘敗、致連續保持兩年之銀盃、竟爾易主、賽畢由西人足球會長格林曉及俞鴻鈞兩氏、以中英語致詞、並由格氏將盃授與西聯隊長柯拉沙接受保存、最後並由格氏將球拍賣、由中國綱球會主辦人譚敬氏以百元購去、</p>
<p>佳機屢失　慘敗先兆</p>
<p>銀角一聲、俞秘書長鴻鈞將球撥動、西聯五鋒齊進、兩度盤旋於中華陣地、終以宿冰初解、濘滑異常、兩隊犯規甚多、時光飛駛、五分鐘瞬已過去、空氣沉悶異常、鍾勇森得許竟成高傅、挑送中央、孫錦順盤過三關、距門不足五碼、一脚送去、竟斜掠門柱而過、四座譁然、勇森文奎兩度進逼、又一再失機、幼良在邊綫傅中、落點極佳、文奎又失諸脚頭太軟、鍾勇森獨闖三關、西聯後防均在前綫、門首僅存史梅頓一人、詎鍾操之過急、致被史斜裏送出、大好良機、均一一錯過、實為昨日慘敗之先兆、</p>
<p>榮才救險　鐵腿開花</p>
<p>西聯隊大舉反攻、柯拉沙拉弓發矢、被李寗迫成角球、幼良單騎進逼、亦被馬山兒迫成角球、雙方各無建樹、其時球又盤旋西聯門下、勇森在十碼處射門、把握未準、不幸中史懐、鮑塞利在中綫得球、沿邊進襲、中華門下、鐵騎紛飛、張榮才臥地撲出、康培爾右綫遙攻、又被榮才揮出、賈幼良乘機進迫、一度扣門、恰到好處、惜被史梅頓臥地撲出、中華門前、又兩呈險境、均賴張榮才勞苦功高、得以化險為夷、時光迅速、三十分鐘內各無進展、中華旣屢脫險境、大軍聯騎進逼、錦順主射、被馬山兒迫成角球、幼良主開、落點極佳、錦順候個正着、略一撥動、球從右柱彈入門內、中華首開紀錄、</p>
<p>黑炭功高　梅開二度</p>
<p>中綫開球後、西聯大舉進逼、兩度在華疆盤旋、榮才開球越出門綫、被罰任意球、中華門前又成紛亂、柯拉沙忙裏偷巧、用手偷擊入綱、法官傑倫眼快、執法如山、宣佈失效、勇森獲得高球、盤過馬逹、馬山兒兩衛、力搗球門、史梅頓撥出未遠、陳鎭和趕上一脚恰中門角、中華隊再開紀錄、以二對零赫赫佔先、開球後中華攻勢極盛、不久小華特沿邊侵襲、底綫勾中、馮運佑踢來未遠、鮑塞利頭攻、開墨爾遙攻、均被榮才救出險境、小黑炭再得良機、惜以錦順越位失去、麥克勞犯規、錦順主踢被接、小華特同志度反攻、與鮑塞利聯騎進逼、銀笛大鳴、上半時結束、二對零中華隊佔優、</p>
<p>西聯反攻　被奪一隻</p>
<p>檸檬過後、再戰開始、球一度在西境盤旋後、又至中華境內、小華特單騎直闖、幸越高飛去、柯拉沙再度攻門、榮才又化險為夷、鎭和撥球進攻、直逹底綫、惜操之過急、斜掠而去、幼良在右角遙攻、惟數度環攻、均無進展、開墨爾鮑塞利聯騎攻門、均被榮才救出險地、馬山兒受傷離場、西聯以十人應戰、鮑塞利攻門、運佑失脚、卡倫一脚碰去、榮才又營救出險、錦順反攻未遂、反被西軍大舉進逼、鮑塞利煞是利害、一脚射去、榮才撲救不及、西聯扳回一球、成二對一、而中華隊從此門戶洞開、</p>
<p>再失兩城　遂告慘敗</p>
<p>其時球尚在中華疆界、鎭和救出險境、直衝西陣、被麥克勞擋住、賈幼良趕上傅中、黑炭加上一脚、竟被史隻手托出、鮑塞利再度扣關、急而且銳、幸擦橫木而過、中華五鋒齊進、兩次被却、西軍環攻、開墨爾開角球、幾入者屢、幸未遭陷、鎭和勇森三進攻均未得利、柯拉沙鮑塞利再去中華門下、均切柱而過、中華賈鍾孫陳諸將、一再失機、小華特沿邊進襲、直搗華門、榮才撲救失效、中華再度被陷、被迫成二對二平手、詎一波未平、一波又起、鮑塞利再攻門、榮才拍出未遠、柯拉沙加上一脚、以中鵠的、三對二西聯反勝一球、詎第二球尚不滿三分鐘也、此後中華雖思努力反攻、無如駒光易逝、將士疲憊、加以地滑異常、不易把住、錦順方至西人陣地、而銀笛已鳴、結果中華反以　對二失敗、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>兒童敎育小說</p>
<h3>小男兒　（一）（四）（三）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>摩複述他遭了損失的故事，裴先生聽着，臉色逐漸嚴重起來，因為孩子們以前雖然有許多小過失，可是他們還沒有作偽過。</p>
<p>「你們坐下」，他說道：等到大家坐了以後，他的眼光從一個臉一上移到另一個臉上，一種慘淡的神情，使人看見比一頓痛罵還要難受，同時徐徐說道：</p>
<p>「孩子們，現在我要向各個人發一個簡單的問句，我只要求一個誠實的答復，我不願以恐嚇，騙術，或巧取的手段來找出這件事的眞相；你們每個人都有良心的。那個得罪了韜摩的人，現在正是他的機會來謀補救，并且在我們大家面前來改過。為一時的利欲所誘，我以為有時還是情有可原，可是欺騙却不同了。所以不要於偷竊以外再加」瞞謊，還是明白承認那末我們可以勉力帮助你使我們忘了那件事」。</p>
<p>他停了一響，房間裏寂然無聲；然後他慢慢將這問句鄭重問過了各個人，雖然各人請氣有些不同，全體却作同樣的答語。每個臉兒都漲得通紅，顯出興奮，因此裴先生不能取臉色作為標記，幾個小童子慌張得那麽利害，連委簡單的幾個字也訥訥不能出諸口，仿佛心虛犯罪模樣，然而分明他們是不會的，當他問到乃德，他特別把他的聲音放柔和些，因為那可憐的孩子看去那麽苦楚，裴先生對他也自表同情。他相信他是個犯罪的人，極望那孩子不敢再來一次謊瞞，所以拿友誼的情態使他能無畏地把眞相說出來。</p>

<h3>論雪</h3>
<p>— （惟經）</p>
<p>雪這東西，是再也可怪不過的。在冬季裏下的，是六辦的，十分整齊，各片都是一式，而且飄下地來，似乎是乾的，雖然飄在身上，只須用手輕輕地一撲，便都撲掉了。可是在春季裏下的，可就大不相同了。每一顆雪花，都是不整形的，花瓣殘缺的也有，分不淸的也有。飄下地來，極易融化。飄在衣上，很快的就化成一滴水。雖然是今天申時交春的，在未時下的雪，還是冬雪的形態與性質，若是戌時或是亥時下的，便是別一副嘴臉完全是春雪的樣兒了。何以冬雪與春雪，分得那麽淸，在科學書上，也宋見論及，但據我想來，或許是因為換季之後的氣候不同之所致。</p>
<p>據我們鄉間的常識，冬雪是有助於農產物的，理由是雪的寒冷，可直透重泥，把一切在秋間，蟄伏在泥中的害虫，或是害虫所下的卵塊凍死，所以冬雪下得愈多，農夫愈是歡喜，說的是雪飛六出，預兆年豐。至於春雪，那是農人的大敵，因為春雪是有使稚嫩的麥根，腐爛之害的。因此，我希望老天今冬多下幾塲雪。預備明春下的，趕着今冬都下完了罷。</p>
<h3>雪的古諺解</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>天寒地凍，少不得的要下雪，而本欄主者，自然也少不得的得出一期「雪的專號」，應個景兒，於是把就在手頭的二個雪的古諺，附以新解；敷衍成文，以充補白。</p>
<p>雪獅子向火　雪獅子向火，意思是支持不住，這正合了現在一般男女的戀愛過程。小姑居處無郞，正在需求着性的慰藉。在這當兒，只須有一位善於獻媚之術的男性，加以誘惑，便如雪獅子向火似的不能自持而不免於幹出不可吿人的苟且之事來了。同時，未與任何女性發生過性的關係的處男，一旦投身於脂粉巿塲中，只須一經久慣風月的女性的勾引，便也無不像獅子向火那麼的癱軟了半截，只得任人擺佈，而無法自拔了。</p>
<p>在國際間，也可附會阿國以蕞爾菲洲一小邦，居然敢與强意論兵，其勢，也分明是以雪獅子向火。但是如今國聯是以集團之力，對意制裁了。意以國之力，與全世界抗衡，依勢而論，自然也有些兒像雪獅子向火。</p>
<p>雪中送炭　在古代甚麼都說厚道，但尙不免於少有雪中送炭者。這年頭兒，世道淪亡，炎凉日甚，任誰都只具着勢利眼，儘有的是錦上添花，一百個中，也找不出一個二個雪中送炭者來了。有財有勢者，自身的三十初度，老太爺八十冥慶，只須一有舉動，便有不少的趨炎附勢者來孝敬奉承。失勢者呢，破產跳海，大家都對之冷笑一聲，肯說一句半句同情話的，已是十分厚道的了。誰若肯雪中送炭，加以援助，便會給人笑為天字第一號大傻子。瞧吧，嗷嗷待哺的災鴻，現在還大半在冰天雪地中等死呢。從這，也就可見雪中送炭者的少有了。</p>
<p>至於國際間，也何嘗不是如此。自己沒有力量的，便休想有人肯仗義執言。强有力者，最多也不過自掃門前雪而已，誰肯來雪中送炭？</p>
<h3>大雪下的朝陽</h3>
<h3>雪的漫話</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>下了雪，最快活的是狗，狗老是愛在雪地上跑。雪地上經狗一踏，便深深地留下了梅花脚印。同時呢，麻雀們，却活該倒霉，地上的糧食，都給白雪蓋住了，啾啾啁啁的閙一個不休。所以俗諺有「雪下狗歡喜，麻將一肚氣」之語。（或許麻雀也在謳歌着雪，憎世無鳥舌人，無由證明。）</p>
<p>小孩子對於雪，也是十分歡迎的，擲雪球，堆雪人，雪獅子，够樂。我小時候，也很愛玩雪，因此常受父母的呵斥。到年長了些，才知成人們也愛雪的。踏雪訪梅，對雪咏詩等玩意兒，還算是挺風雅的呢。在詩韻合璧裏，雪的典故是那麽多。自古以來，咏雪的詩，讀着三天三晚，還讀不盡。由此，可知成人們的愛雪，也不亞於小孩子。</p>
<p>石頭記裏的檻外人妙玉女士，在冬天，從梅瓣上收下雪花來，密封了藏在地下，用以冲煮雨前茶，說的還不許俗人　　一嘗，那是一派的空門氣味，自然可說是別具一格的。但在我的故鄉的老太婆之輩，却也有在藏着臘雪水，而居為奇貨的據說可治目疾，可愈喉痛，還可以療傷寒症。雖然這倒也是廢物利用，但這究竟不是華陀醫師的獄卒太太所燒剩的一頁醫書上說的，所以我總覺得有些不可為訓。</p>
<p>以上所說的，自然都是些非二十世紀的話。但是皚皚白雪，却是跟着時代的，到了現在，依然是那麽吃香。瞧哪，專做「的呢麼呀」的新體詩的二十世紀新詩人，却還是在那裏吟咏着雪。機械化的攝影家，一到下雪天，也紛紛的活動着開末拉。羅馬，巴黎回來的美術家，也儘愛把雪景，搬上畫面。</p>
<p>還有，雪，似乎不只給紳士們歡迎，說得意識歪曲些，大姐姨娘，湖絲阿姐等等，都把遜雪三分白的雪花膏，當作第二生命呢。若是你對女性贊一聲「膚白如雪」哈哈，伊準會從心坎子裏樂出來，承認你是一位識貨朋友。</p>
<h3>雪晨</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>昨午天空彤雲密佈，寒暑表上驟然降低了劃度。晚飯以後，撒下了鵝翎般的大雪，各店都比平時提早上門板。我和伊並小孩子躱在房裏，圍爐取煖，爐火熊熊，也不覺得十分寒冷。　　第二天睡在床上，天還沒破曉，身體上雖然蓋了絲綿被，寒氣是使勁的逼人！被窩內是熱烘烘的，戀着不捨起身。可是陽光已打從玻璃窗上透射進來，隨陽光望去，窗外屋上的雪是格外映得潔白可喜！就打從床上坐起，盥洗已畢，用過早點，正捧了一份報紙在讀。寒梅投來一張請柬，相的十時賞雪，並備火鍋煖酒，這眞妙極了，天氣又這樣晴和。</p>
<p>在席上，共計十人。寒梅主人這樣的提議：『我出一個上聯給你們，如果對不出下聯，各罰舊棉衣一件。我們想到災區的同胞，啼飢號寒，十分可憐，殘酷的嚴冬，點水滴凍，又下了這樣大雪，我們酒酣耳熱的時候，應當替災區同胞設身處地想想！不去救濟他們，他們豈不要活活凍死嗎？』說罷，伊把『雪落板橋鷄犬過，踏成竹葉梅花形。』做上了聯，座上王君就提議；『算我們學問淺吧！各出棉衣一伴。』其他的人都附和了，議决把這衣服交民敎館轉遞災區。</p>
<p>這樣大冷的雪天，有錢的人們應當捐錢助賑，沒錢出助幾件衣服也好的，希望踴躍輸將吧！</p>
<h3>雪的故事</h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>天氣是冷了！那雪花也在開始着飄揚了！於是引起我寫這篇文字的動機：</p>
<p>「霜前冷，雪後寒。」這是中國的兩句俗諺。但是我們不要輕視這兩句俗諺，它是非常的合於科學化，我們知道：在下過雪以後，天氣一定會有進一步的寒冷，所以一般窮人們，遇着下雪，總要大喊其乖乖不得了！不過另一方面，雪却是一件有益於人的東西。根據着「瑞雪」的名詞，和「雪兆豐年」的成語，可知道雪却是一件為東西，假使冬季裏面不落一塲雪，那才是乖乖不得了呢！</p>
<p>提起雪來，我倒想起一件故事來了！這事是前年的一伴事實，據說：某地有一販酒的人家，這一年因為販不起酒，於是家裏面堆積了不少的空罎子，在冬天的時候。恰巧下了幾决大雪，這販酒的老板，因為冷的難過，就用個勺子把那乾緊的雪挖到空罎子裏，像這樣挖了幾决，居然挖到一百罎以上了！在他不過是一時的遊戲，並且藉此來抵抗冷的侵襲罷了！那知事情有出乎意料之外的，在第二年的春夏之交，該地突然遇到空前的旱災，一般富户們，拿着大洋錢（那時，還沒有改革幣制）都沒有地方買水。正在非常恐慌的時候，這販酒的老板，想起了罎中儲藏的雪來，急忙揭開一望，已經變成很淸的水了。於是透了一個風聲，每罎售洋之元，各富户因為這是雪水，很不容易得到，都爭先恐後的派人去賣，沒有兩天，都賣完了！他—這販酒的人—也發了一個小財，作他的資本。這就是因雪發財的故事，不過這是可遇而不可求的事情呀！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>賈多才今天被這女英雄包圍了，使出生平硬打軟騙的法子，也不奈他們何，這一腔怒氣，恨不得把腦袋砍下來，才透得出去。現在看到王北海站在一邊，也用話來譏諷着，這就忍不住那一陣肝火了，於是瞪了眼向他問道：你是什麽人？敢用言語來冒犯我。我吿訴你，我不是好欺侮的。北海似乎是預備了一種步驟來說話的，扯扯自己的衣襟，依然是笑着，因用很和緩的音調答道：賈先生，我認得你，我知道你是銀行界的人。我决不和你門口。我也許是好意，用話來提醒你。你若是耍到我頭上來找是非，那我就讓了你，你說我怕你，也未嘗不可。我希望你拿出這種大無畏精神去對付那班太太們罷。說着，一陣呵呵大笑把右手抬着一揚，把身子一縮，就退到後院去了。賈多才站在遇廳裏，倒不免呆了一呆。不過他回想到北海來晚了的那句話，忽然明白過來，莫不是那位寃家走了。立刻跑到屋子裏去張望時那裏有人。坐在椅子上想了一想，就連連拍了桌子呌茶房。茶房見月英走上樓去了，正覺得這事有些扎手。現在聽了賈多才這樣亂呌，就臉紅着走了進來。賈多才手按了桌子，直跳起來，問道：我的太太呢？只這一聲，却聽到窗子外面，哄然一片笑聲。他就兩手又了腰，瞪了兩雙大眼，向茶房望着。茶房低聲道：你太太到樓上藍專員夫人那裏去了。他答復着還是很小心，直垂了兩手，微低了頭。賈多才道：你到樓上去，把他呌了回來。你吿訴他，這裏是是非之地，我要搬開這裏了。茶房却不肯走開；低聲答道：怕是請不動吧。聽藍夫人說，就是怕賈先生要他回來，所以把他留着。（三八七）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （子明）</p>
<p>白銀也似的雪花紛紛地飛舞，頓將我們的大地點綴得怪可愛的。天氣是冷刺入骨，各地學生救亡運動的熱血，正成反比的湧洶澎湃。某校的學生，當然不能例外；可是，他們的運動，是毫沒有自由，處處被人監視禁阻着。而內心的憤怨，却更加强地燃燒着。</p>
<p>有幾十位學生，在空塲上手忙脚亂地，將地上的積雪，堆成許多雪人。這個雪人是某某叛逆，那個雪人是某某漢奸，都標上姓名；而所做的面孔，與所標的人，的確維妙維肖。學生頓時武裝起來了拿木槍或大刀，將雪人的頭斬下來，掛在校門口，以為各奸賊都被梟示衆了</p>
<p>這種傻幹，未免近於阿Ｑ；但，也可見學生愛國的熱忱和憤懣的程度了。</p>

<p>醫學講座</p>
<h3>淋病概論</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>淋菌侵入人體後，在男性則潛伏於尿道粘膜皺襞間，在女子則潛伏於頸管腺腔中，此種淋菌之播殖作用，可以綿延到畢其生而後已，所以與患有此症者交接，其結果必致被其傳染，鮮少幸免，淋菌初决侵入男子生殖器，通常為急性前尿道炎，淋菌侵入女子的生殖器時，則器搆造之複雜，有時鄰接之臟器，亦俱蒙其影響，本症允貴早治，愈早愈佳，否男而染女，女而染男，相互傳染，循環無已，惟擇醫宜愼，庶幾設施恰當，嚴守攝生，不致妨碍病體，療治須得當而合理，如短波透熱之電機療法，混合淋苗之免疫療法，「滅殺淋」之內服及「淋毒舒樂耳」之注入，數者兼具，可謂絕對治療，如此治淋，靡有不愈焉。</p>
<h3>體力與戒煙</h3>
<p>— 佘雷醫師</p>
<p>有煙癡者因長時期受鴉片毒素之侵擾，其身體各部分每不健全，體力遜於常人，故施戒之初，首先須注意其體力，即營養方面，亦必注意採擇，然後體力得以增進，戒煙進行之途，得以平坦，吾則，不審就戒者之體力，則施戒之後，痛苦立現，必無良果，可以斷言，姑無論採用何種戒煙方法，營養物如牛乳，鷄卵，童鷄汁，牛肉汁，新鮮菜蔬及水菓等，均為適宜之品，欲增進就戒者之體力所施用之藥劑如卵黃燐脂，各種維他命，賜保命，鹿茸精，各種內分泌液，砒鐵碘劑等等，均有相當採用之價値，他如神經及胃腸之調理，允屬不可或忽而最緊要者也，此蓋有煙癮者之體力衰弱最明</p>
<p>在逐漸除癡之際，一方面在逐漸增進其體力，則就戒者毫無些微鴉片麻醉力之反感，有之亦不過心理上之心念而已，戒煙而如是，未有不經過安然者矣。</p>
<h3>遺精特效藥「安爾神」</h3>
<p>— 蔣國藩醫師</p>
<p>男子到了春情發動期，即屆發育時期之謂也，通常以年齡計算，的十六歲，然以地域，環境及氣候等等之故，遲早殊不一，在春情發動期間，兩睪丸增大，精細胞開始分裂以形成精蟲，攝護腺，精囊，陰莖等亦俱發育，一切性的微象，一一美具，了解性慾，對異性有羞恥追求之念，或於夜臥，慾念內生，不知利害之徒，乃惟以手淫博一時之愉快，積時累日，遂成習慣，終至身體日就衰弱，精關不固，而致患遺精症者，遺精雖有非病理的，但每週一二次甚或每夜必遺者，胥皆病也，其更甚者，即白畫間亦有精漏者，如大便時，劇烈運動步行後，淫靡之接觸，衣衾之摩擦等，均見有精液漏出者，於是乎覺疲勞頭痛，耳鳴眼花，心悸亢進，精神萎蘼，四肢酸倦，怠於作事，卒至元陽耗損太甚，百病雜侵，成為重篤之神經衰弱症，一般靑年，允不明手淫之害，而以為遺精原於體虛，殊不知體虛正由於手淫之故耳，近世醫學，一日千里，若「安爾神」者Arolsen，可謂治本症之對症速效良藥，余臨床施用，每收良效。</p>
<h3>治淋特效藥二種</h3>
<p>— 孫志耀醫生</p>
<p>淋病傳染易而根治難，此蓋淋菌恒潛在人體尿道粘膜內層，普通藥力，不易深入，即足以透過膜層，直接施殺菌之偉力，復以菌體搆造，乃有胞衣之球菌，比普通無胞衣之菌族，為難撲滅也，通常治療淋病之藥物，胥為內服和外用二者，低劣之內服藥如含有强力之收歛成分者，見效一時而醫治反較不易，他如科拜巴及白檀油等之治淋藥，不說應效不宏，其刺激腎臟，有碍胃腸，恒設法避之而不用，我人臨症上，欲求一合理的治淋內服藥，須無副作用而奏效確實者，其惟「滅殺淋」乎Mesaltropin，此藥之優良，可以國內外各醫師所樂用以證實之，該藥完全根據最新學理，用特殊化學方法製成，其透膜殺菌力之强大，無與以匹，不問菌體包膜以及深藏於粘膜皺襞中者，其藥力無不透過膜層，直接作用於菌體而撲殺之，至於外用藥，通常恒以蛋白銀，　猛養等作為治淋外用洗滌料，殊不知此等之殺菌透膜力不準確，近今所為醫界樂用者，如「淋毒舒樂耳」Gono-Serol，此藥乃淋病血淸所製成，用之能收自動免疫之效，在尿道病變時，允見特效，上述二藥，余屢經試用，或介紹病家，靡有不達全治之境者。</p>
<h3>皮膚名藥愈我面皰</h3>
<p>— 劉問梅</p>
<p>皮膚病名藥「滅絕菌」Misulzine，向以善治瘡疥癬患稱於世，內子頑强頸癬，賴以獲愈，友朋親戚之患各項皮膚疾患者，余輒以是藥介紹，靡有不愈者，最近據友人云，彼之面皰，得「滅絕菌」而治愈，余息面皰近年，以其無影響身體之大碍，任意置之久矣，或謂血液關係，或謂靑年時期所應有，但終無奇藥治之，今聞友人語，即如法泡製而治之，僅旬日，頰上鼻間額際眉端之纍纍顆粒，已消滅無形，如斯良藥，理合稱揚，我知息是病者衆，綠書以為社會人士告。</p>
<h3>多年胃疾獲愈記</h3>
<p>— 倪穆天</p>
<p>余患胃疾决矣，大概由於不愼生冷刺激性飲食品及酗酒而來，荏苒經年，迄未治愈，就醫數度，亦鮮卓效，據醫者云，此乃慢性胃炎，會購服市上治胃病之成藥，先後不下五六種，承多收效一時，愈而再發，苦未得根治，因循至今，食慾不振消化力薄弱，營養失當，身體衰弱，精神蒙其影響無復昔日神情，更有有難堪者，發作時噁心嘔吐，胃部脹滿，不思飲食，腹痛極劇，不可名狀，惡疾聲，無復生趣，前承本刋蔣國藩董醫師之介紹，謂「胃寳」可以根治疑難胃病，即向南洋藥房購得，依法服用，的二週餘，不但夙疾從未發現，胃口亦復旺盛，精神能力逮勝於前，用草斯文，以為良藥之謝。</p>

<p>當人們正在興高采烈地慶祝元旦的時候，從東非却傳來了一個駭人的慘耗，報吿着瑞典的紅十字會救護隊被意國飛機炸燬。據除夕那天，哈瓦斯阿國京城電云：「本社訪員奧柴納特訊，意國飛機數架，頃往南路沃加丹前綫多羅城一帶，投彈轟炸，當將該處瑞典紅十字會服務團房屋，全部炸燬。該團人員，除團長希蘭特博士外，共餘均遭慘死。其中看護一名，助手一名，雖未殞命，但均受傷甚重。……」這慘耗一傳出，舉世輿論，大為譁然，瑞典陸軍軍醫總監宣稱：「意軍在歐洲大戰時，並未如此作惡。」甚至有些主敎也說：「全世界榮譽，恐將為此種慘劇所玷。」瑞典京城的報紙均出號外，「街衢中民衆擁擠，立卽，舉行示威行動，對意國表示反對之意，並有羣衆數百人，　集意國公使館前，憤激之餘，亦有揎拳捋臂作揮擊狀者。」阿國國皇也於一日照會國聯，對意飛機這决慘無人道的暴行提出抗議。</p>
<p>意帝國主義的侵阿戰爭，口口聲聲是替白種人「宣揚文化」，這「宣揚文化」的結果，是使阿國民衆和束非的原野受到白種人的「文明」的砲火所摧殘，阿國的黑人照印度的榜樣受到意帝國主義的蹂躪。舉世觸目着這决慘酷的半殖民地對帝國主義底侵略的抗爭，並且同情於阿國，這種不屈不撓的反抗的情緒。而瑞典以及各國的紅十字會救護隊之前往束非救護阿國的傷兵，正是這偉大的同情的明顯的表現。這决意國的飛機，竟不顧了一般與論的責難，世界人精的反感，除了「宣揚」阿國的民衆而外，並且還轟炸到無辜的瑞典救護隊底身上來，這種殘暴行為，是很明白地暴露了意帝國主義者所謂「宣揚文化」的實質的。</p>
<p>那管意大利法西斯蒂怎樣强辯，說這是「意軍飛機」對阿人的「懲戒」，「並無危害瑞典紅十字會之意」，但是事實是勝於雄辯的，意大利法西斯蒂底猙獰面目，在這决暴行之中，已被揭露無遺了。</p>
<h3>二四年中國的話劇</h3>
<p>— 克銘</p>
<p>「從此話劇便要消滅了！」</p>
<p>說這話的人是因為有聲電影不僅已經具備了話劇的聲白的這些優點，而且還能突破了話劇所受到的時間與空問的限制。自然，這話不是沒有理由的，但是，如果眞正理解藝術的人是不會說這樣的話的。</p>
<p>在藝術的領域裏，話劇之與電影，正和詩歌之與小說，繪畫之與照相一樣，各有其本質之差異與特殊的優越性。並不因為小說之被產生而詩歌就此消滅，也並不因為照相之被發明而檢畫就此絕跡，正因為新的產生而兩者就會逐漸揚棄了各自的優劣而相得益彰地進至更高的藝術階段。</p>
<p>二十四年的話劇運動並不因中國有聲電影的產生而低落以至消滅下去，相反地，這一年來的話劇運動的蓬勃的現象是可以使人詫異的。不僅在氣象的蓬勃上，而且，由新的內容導源來的新的技巧的建立，更鞏固了話劇在藝術領域裏存在的價値。</p>
<p>二十四年度的戲劇運動的蓬勃，上海舞臺協會的「回春之曲」與「水銀燈下」在歲首的演出是該有相當的功勳的。不僅是在劇本本身的Melo與趣味上適合了一般小巿民的口胃，而且卄多餘個大小電影明星的「親自登臺」是的確足以造成話劇的賣座紀錄的。後來幾個劇社公演時租借戲院的便利與營業的稍見起色，得力於前者是不可謂少的。</p>
<p>「回春之曲」的劇本雖然適合了小巿民觀衆，但是過分的浪漫蒂克不僅是把反帝的熱情冲為淡淡的一筆，浮光掠影的叙述與趣味的過分被注重，在演出的效果上是沒有得到更深人的收穫的。趙丹的演技的認眞博得了很多贊嘆，袁牧之的化裝與小動作也為一般人所稱頌，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>只可惜是搶了人家的戲。</p>
<p>可是在「水銀燈下」裏，袁牧之的沉着與洗鍊的演技，不僅是沒有了上述的缺點，而且，使整個劇本得到相當成就的，他的功蹟是該居共半。</p>
<p>這裏，除了承襲了「回春之曲」裏的過分的浪漫蒂克的氣息之外，叙述過去歷史的冗長的台詞是破壞了全劇的空氣的。</p>
<p>導演的技巧大體上講起來可以說是過得去的，雖然還存留着一些小疵，例如在「回春之曲」第二幕裏塲面的散亂等</p>
<p>瑪麗特萊漱，里昻巴里摩亞主演的影片「情絲萬丈」就是根據了曁南劇社公演的舞台劇「油漆未乾」改編的。</p>
<p>「油漆未乾」雖然導演的努力與劇本的輕鬆，但是因為生活環境的關係，不能十分抓住中國觀衆的情緒，二三個演員台詞的生硬和動作的瑣碎，更損傷了全劇的效果。舒湮相當嫻熟，飾相當於瑪麗特萊漱的角色的王瑩在動作上，化妝上，都未能表現出老女僕所應有的神態。</p>
<p>靑鐘劇社的「阿萊城姑娘」同樣因為生活環境關係不能為一般觀衆所十分瞭解，對白的不通俗也是個致命傷。幸賴有顧而已的船長，朱銘仙的母親，才稍稍使全劇生動一些。</p>
<p>演話劇一個先决條件是對白的自然與高低音的分得淸楚，可是淸心女中所演出的「仲夏夜之夢」却並未具備了這一個條件。服裝的華麗也並未補救了全劇的生疎。</p>
<p>約翰劇社的「白姑娘」，在劇本上因為具備了恐怖，挿科打諢，低級趣味，在演出的效果上是很容易地贏得了一些成就。「自由」雖然很深刻地描劃了四個不同的個性，可惜演員的生疎與沒有深切地去體會，演出的效果是决於「白姑娘」的，被人所熟悉的「小偷」得了燈光與佈景的帮助，還能抓住了觀衆的情感</p>
<p>培明女中上演的「揚子江暴風雨」「三姊妹」，沒有達到較高的成就，「壓迫」因為劇本輕鬆與演員如沈如琛等的努力，是獲得相當的贊美的。雖然在意義上遠不及前者。繼南京而在上海出演的「娜拉」，第一决是在光華附中，全劇的效果得到了有限度的成功。導演沒有有條理地處理全劇，康彰雖很努力，但還沒有十分體會到劇中人的個性。</p>
<p>復旦劇社的「委曲求全」，在劇本本身和演出的技巧上，是達到了完整。在小動作和大地位上顯出了導演的努力，演員如鳳子，顧得剛等都很稱職。雖然也是齣諷刺喜劇，因為生活的接近，在操縱觀衆的情緖上，較之，『油漆未乾」，勝任得多了。</p>
<p>「患難朋友」，「貞操」，「臨別」是媽蟻劇社第二次公演的三個劇本，在劇本的選取上，演出的效果上，沒有如預期那麼成功。</p>
<p>上海劇院公演的「摩登夫人」，在形式上，和最近中公演的一般舞台劇是有無出入的，導演可惜戚染了一點中國初期「話劇」的作風，雖然演員如洪瑛等都很努力。全劇的大意是勸摩登化的婦女回家庭去，作者的苦心，是在改善人心。</p>
<p>業餘劇人雖然第一次就公演了已演過好幾遍的熟劇本「娜拉」，但是，在不要婦女踏進社會去的現狀下，這個劇本是値得一演再演的。</p>
<p>導演與演員的用心與努力，使全劇的演出獲得了高度的成功。藍蘋，趙丹，金山在這裏的演技也得到廣冶的贊美</p>
<p>「英雄與美人」雖是個很好的諷刺劇，可惜曁中劇社不努力，地位的凌亂，動作的生硬，對白的牽强，把整個劇本葬送了。</p>
<p>想使生意好一些而把「蠢貨」易名為「風流寡婦」而上演的嘩嘩劇社，賣座的成績却是意外的凄慘，在形式上，幾乎完全京劇化。</p>
<p>在形式上，幾乎完全京劇化的，還有上海劇院二次公演的「西施」。</p>
<p>在形式上，幾乎完全承襲了上海劇院第一决演出的手法的，是明星公司公演的「月兒彎彎」。</p>
<p>實騐劇團公演的「慳吝人」與「壓迫」，也沒有什麽良好的成績。</p>
<p>約翰劇社又公演了「南歸」，」患難朋友」，「隧道」，似均未謹愼地注意到舞台上的技巧。</p>
<p>二十四年度公演的諷刺喜劇中，在意義的積極上是最値得稱道的，特別是音饗效果的帮助與最後的燈光的突變，更為全劇生色不少。除了整個調子還欠明快以外，全劇是自始至終，惹人發笑，顧而已的縣長，藍蘋的木匠妻，葉露茜的女兒均很純熟，金山似未能盡合劇中人個性，王瑩雖很努力，可惜還保持了在「油漆未乾」裏的作風。</p>
<p>復旦劇社所公演的四幕悲劇「雷雨」也有了相當的建樹。劇作者用一種深沉的悲愴的事調暴露了大家庭的醜惡，導演對於小動作也頗費心機，演員如胡念忠，鳳子都很盡職。</p>
<p>洽中女中公演了「東北女宿舍之一夜」，在目前的中國局勢下，這個劇本是最値得推薦的。它指出了學生們今後的出路，同時很尖刻地嘲諷了學生生活。演出的成績還差强人意。</p>
<p>很籠統地，很概略地紀錄了一下二十四年度的話劇運動，錯誤和遺漏，是在所難免的，在二十四年話劇的熱鬧和蓬勃是可賀可喜的雖有些非驢非馬的東西混雜在裹面，那是在發展的路途上必不可避免的，新的內容的創造，和由於新內容而產生的新技巧的建立，已經迅速地把落後的中國話劇推進到了另一個較高的階段，在這民族危機一天加深一天，愛國救亡運動一天擴張一天的現在，認識了你在自己領域裏所應盡的天職，加緊努力吧，從事話劇的朋友！</p>
<h3>歌女</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>當街燈開始耀眼的時候，熱鬧的前門外，便有一羣打扮得花枝招展的年靑姑娘們出現了。</p>
<p>他們是專作歌唱的買賣的。太陽一下山，她們便脫下襤樓的短衫，換上一身簇新的衣裳，黃瘦的臉上施着雪白的香粉，蓬亂的頭髮塗上香滑的油膏，枯槁的雙唇沾了鮮麗的胭脂，嬝嬝娜娜地走上街頭，在八大胡同的妓院裏進出，逗客人們買唱，受客人們的狎戲與恥笑，受姑娘們的白眼與辱駡，受……直到夜闌更深，才邁着疲乏的脚步走回家裏來。過着這看來是粉紅色的，實際是灰白色的生活的小姑娘們，她們是串百家門子的歌女。</p>
<p>四喜子幹這買賣已經兩年多了。十四歲起就跟她爺作這營生，不論是冬天還是夏天，不論是降雪還是淋雨，每一天從天黑起就出門，一直是夜深，父女倆才像兩個幽靈一般，在黑漆漆的胡同里走着趕回家里來。</p>
<p>「四喜兒，快點裝點呀，你想時候還早不是？」是她的母親的聲音了，說話的時侯帶着斥責的神氣。</p>
<p>「媽讓我停一夜不好嗎？咱作活計亦是抵得上的。」四兒子把手里的活計扔在綫筐裏，挺起身來這樣說。</p>
<p>「四喜兒，你亦不小啦，亦該代媽分些心才是。」她媽的聲音轉得柔和些了。「媽吿你，不要惹你爸生氣吧，好好兒聽話，就去吧。時候不早了。」</p>
<p>四喜兒沒說話，檢上活計來，低着頭作下去。</p>
<p>「你爺這末老了，還不是一樣，他偸過一天閒空沒有，你，還是去吧！」她媽似乎是在懇求了。「過些時，再呌你妹妹帮你的腔，等她學會了，你就不用再出去了。」</p>
<p>「過些時，老是過些時，要等到什麽時候呢？」四喜子眼坑里翻了翻白，釘着着她媽一眼。「我不去，我死亦不去，餓死亦認啦，咱再也不受這份活罪了！」</p>
<p>她媽楞了楞，一句話亦說不出。她曉得幹這營生是艱苦的，女兒亦大了，受客人們的狎戲她自家心里亦疼得難受，但是有什麼辦法呢？自從她爸閒了下來，一家吃的，穿的，用的又不是靠四喜兒這張嘴麽？停了停，她又規勸着說，</p>
<p>「好孩子聽媽的話！有什麼苦頭忍過亦就算了。你不去呌你爸同媽活活餓死不成？別讓你爸聽見了又得吵鬧。」</p>
<p>「忍！忍，你曉得那種味道嗎？人家動手動脚的，拿人家幾角錢就得讓他們隨意擺佈麽？他們高興動你這邊就動你這邊，高興摸你那邊就摸你那邊，咱跟。「下處」（是北平一種妓院的名稱，最低級的）的姑娘們有什麼兩樣？而且現在這市面，「下處」里聽的人不多「茶室」里雖說多點兒，可是扒門的又要點門錢（一種看門人的外快）一個子兒亦不凖少。就讓你生意好，串上十幾二十家，喊得嗓子啞，又不是只剩下塊把錢。班子里的姑娘們又慣會討客人手裏的好，老是說賞錢給得太多，又要從中尅扣而且……」四喜兒說到這里，眼淚撲撲簌簌地掉了下來，胸口亦抽搐得利害。接着地一邊用手使勁揉着胸脯，一面斷斷續續地說下去：</p>
<p>「還有那些不得好死的總爺們…給他們瞧見了…右邊一巴掌，…左邊一脚尖，擰着你的頭髮……給你鞭子吃……吃，…你瞧，」她指着臂上那塊紫黑帶藍的傷痕，「又不是咋晚給他們擰的：媽……媽呀……我死亦不出去，我……我…在家里作活計…」四喜子再亦說不下去了，掀起衫裾揩着眼淚，一面又乾嗽着，喘不過氣來。</p>
<p>「喜兒，別說了，媽疼你的，」作母親的聲音亦有點嘶啞了。</p>
<p>就在這時候，她爸連嗽帶喘的跑出來了。</p>
<p>「喜兒，我吿你，天下什麽事不是一個樣？從前我端戲班里人家的飯碗，吃的苦頭比你還來得多！這就是說，他們是有個的人，曉得麽？那個有錢的人不使勢，不尋開心？要不，他們到窰子裏幹什麽？凡事總得忍些兒，你不去，咱們明天就得勒着肚皮！咳，只怨我骨頭硬了，現在又是荒年，要不，我讓我自家的女孩子給人玩弄，在我面前給人們玩弄，你說……」</p>
<p>「得了吧！你們一句是忍，二句是忍，忍到那個年頭才不再忍呢？人不是一樣長的嗎？為什麼咱就得給他們玩弄，咱幹別的營生難道就餓死不成？你說，你們吃過那些苦頭沒有來？」</p>
<p>「好！」四喜子扔掉手里的活計，不再哭了高聲嚷着說。「好，咱，今晚再走一趟，有誰動手動脚的我就給他們巴掌，鬧得生意作不成，你們別埋怨我。」</p>
<p>「作這事情的就不是人，嘿：…」四喜子把外衫脫下來狠狠地走進房裏去。</p>
<p>當街頭開始耀眼的時候，在熱鬧的前門外，一羣打扮得花枝招展的年靑小姑娘出現了。在其中，有一個就是四喜子。</p>
<h3>帶來了一個喜訊</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—還鄉苦雪之三—</p>
<p>寂寞，在孤獨者的身上，或者是相宜的，不，對於一個幽閑的情趣者，那倒也很能調劑脾胃，被火燃燒了心弦的流浪的人，被一切的苦痛與憂鬱交攻下的游子，寂寞，那是不需要的，在萬籟俱靜的寂寞里，能把無窮的煩惱，哀思，統統地搬進腦府，團轉，團轉，像一面走馬燈一樣，同時，無情的利箭就會不客氣的直穿進了胸膛。</p>
<p>你不是不願意寂寞麽？這想念是做不到的，每天，一睜眼，老天總像有莫大的悲愁，拉下了苦臉，只有一面窗子的小房間里，整日的被凄凉的雲霧攏罩着，各個人的臉上，沒有笑。早晨，竄出了被窩，隨便的抹一把臉，挾了企望的心情，忽忙的各自走去。</p>
<p>我呢？這就難了，不是主事的人，說不定還會被主事的人祗當作一個毛頭小子來看待，一切，自然都要受命於他人的。想出去換一卞沉悶的空氣，路途不熟，雪又那樣大，牠會埋沒了你的脚面。雖說毛頭小子不致於迷失路途，然而，主事人的臉孔畢竟不是好看的。</p>
<p>接洽，疏通，整天的在這出面忙碌着，企望的心情，帶回來的時候，却是一團懊喪。當油燈擺在我們的臉前，差不多總要有一陣牢騷的。</p>
<p>－今天你去看×司令，怎麽樣？</p>
<p>－很難，一片官話，什麽都沒有表示。</p>
<p>－那，老魏說：我們就停在這里不走了麽？</p>
<p>－走？誰有這種辦法，早就知道，這决的啟行是冒險的。</p>
<p>一團濃烟把每個人都劃開，濃烟里，大家都沉靜下去！</p>
<p>炭火熊熊地燃着，院子里已結成的冰面，隨着過路人的脚步咯吱咯吱的響。</p>
<p>－我眞不相信會有這一個，會蹲在不着邊際的鄭州。</p>
<p>老兄，不必談，現在總該使你相信了，一切的事，絕不能在理想中肯定的。</p>
<p>－她媽的，我還說趕在二十八九，回到天津過年呢！</p>
<p>老劉瞧了一下小魏的臉，淡淡地：「算了吧，在年前，大嫂子是沒有福氣能得到你的溫馨了。</p>
<p>笑，由一個人傳遍了大够，小魏的面皮究竟不厚，禁不住的紅了。</p>
<p>小魏，是一個充滿着熱情的靑年，結了婚，剛三四個月，為了生浩，鞭子趕着他到這暮靄的古城，如果在不經意的時候，相互的提到了自己的女人，那他，就會滔滔不絕的叙述着她的美點，心兒癢癢地，臉子就跟着紅起來。</p>
<p>－明天，眞的，我去找×××請他想個辦法，小魏說，如果不成的話，仍舊回去，不必在這里等了。要開銷，要應酬，錢沒有了，等死！</p>
<p>當然，這種提議，我們是樂於接受的，為了說話上便利起見，祗好請小魏勞神一趟了。</p>
<p>第二天，火紅的大太陽照一上了東方，天空是一面淸澄的鏡子，積雪，不敢像往常樣的頑抗，體質溶解了，滴答滴答的，街上的泥土路是濘滑的。</p>
<p>也許今天能給我們好的消息吧？天，在帶來了煇煌的象徵呢。心里想。</p>
<p>房間里的空氣和從前一樣，孤獨的，我守着燈火翻看於天的新聞，讓時問在每一個小字和每一段廣告上溜過去。後來，他們回來了，一進門，就帶來了不平常的喜氣。</p>
<p>——呵，費了多少的解說，總算有確定的日子了，二十五日動身，到家過年的日子不會躭誤喲！他狂喊着，笑了，熱情的眼睛眞有點媚人。</p>
<p>呌了一桌子的菜，喜訊，蕩漾着每個人的心苗，不知是那個人的提議又喊了兩個花姑娘斟酒。熱烈·狂歡·什麽都在在歡里忘去了。</p>
<p>全部的希藉，緊拴在車輛的奔馳上，算一下，該還有一個星期的逗留吶！</p>
<p>播音節目</p>
<h3>歌曲介紹</h3>
<p>生之哀歌</p>
<p>我們努力過，我們掙扎過，為着取得智識的果實，我們一刻也不曾懶惰，可是我們和廣大失業的兄弟一樣，得的是痛苦和飢餓。我們渴望着雨水，像大旱中的枯禾。</p>
<p>我們努力過，我們掙扎過，我們像那小鳥兒一樣，想築成了座安樂窩。但是饑寒會逼得你四出奔波，疾病會逼得你無可奈何；我那可憐的孩子，就是這犧牲者的一個孩子呵，你閉着眼兒，媽媽　有甜美的催眠曲？祗有一只生的哀歌！</p>
<p>我們努力過？我們掙扎過，們不能等着餓死，我們不能等着　死，我們必　　　活戰綫內　！肉搏！我們必　向生活戰綫肉搏！肉搏！把戰歌代替哀歌。前進，前進，兄弟們！改革我們舊的生活。前進，前進，創造我們新的生活，創造我們新的</p>

<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇『瀟湘問病』</p>
<p>蒼茫暮色漸黃昏。颯颯微風細雨涔。暗淡瀟湘聲寂寂。凄凉瘦竹影沉沉。怡紅公子多情種。想起了多愁多病人。　笠簑衣穿帶好。持燈急急走園林。行來已到瀟湘館。姑娘是，作罷詩章纔擱筆。丫環忽報二爺臨。只見他，今朝打扮非往昔。寳哥哥，何事效學漁翁形。公子聞言忙相同。妹妹身體可安寗。藥可吃。飯可增。近日不可把詩吟。我是終朝心難放。故而冒雨探分明。妹妹若愛此裝束。緩日即當送一身。　卿回言何需此。漁婆形像實無名。話出口。暗思忖。漁翁漁婆不該云。桃花面泛羞難掩。默默低頭不作聲。一個是，無意言語偏說錯，一個是，未聞情實豈知情。紅樓一夢多變幻。聊表那，問病　湘一段姻。恨月老不牽情絲綫。故使醫藥總無靈。徒負雙雙一片心。</p>

<p>是，不染織塵無俗氣。名花解語玉生香。遇人不淑常悲怨，可恨夫君沒主張。撇下，五歲孩兒將蕩婦戀。去年出走狠心腸。時將一載無消息。衣飾完全當質光。幸喜嬌兒多活潑。明珠掌上愛無雙。她就到，公司投考心懷懼。過幾天，錄取前茅見報章。朝朝來往勤營業。同事們，二字花瓶送美娘，那經理貪兼好色。佳人在側似顚狂。萬惡黃金來誘惑。襄王神女會高唐。有一天，二人正在情濃處。電話傳來報禍殃。花瓶的，家內忽然遭火燬。嬌兒一命赴無常。她心如刀割肝腸斷。無限悽悲淚滿眶。撫屍哭罷飄然出。不管人家論短長。聽說她，已經削髮入菴堂。</p>

As for the cases that have already been judged, if they are not final, an appeal can be filed, and if they are final, if it is only a procedural violation, it is not practically beneficial to revoke the procedure, and there is no need for relief. If the content is also illegal, it should be combined with extraordinary appeals for relief. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Wuhu: The Wuhu Public Security Bureau's illegal and excessive fines in the tobacco case have caused widespread resentment among the people. All sectors held a joint meeting at the county chamber of commerce again on the afternoon of the 5th, with more than 500 people attending. They were extremely angry and decided to send another telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Tobacco Prohibition Headquarters, demanding that the Anhui Provincial Government immediately order the dismissal and investigation of Zhang Zongfen, the director of the Wuhu Public Security Bureau, vowing not to stop until this is done.

<h3>President Chiang's New Year's Day Radio Address: The Essentials of National Self-Salvation and Saving the Nation (Continued)</h3>
<p>To establish the foundation of national morality and spirit through the New Life Movement, and to promote the progress of material civilization through the National Economic Construction Movement. From the above, it can be seen that the New Life Movement is a revolutionary movement to enable the people of the whole country to establish personality and revive the nation. The so-called New Life is a rational life based on the spirit of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and the principle of adapting to the needs of the times. We must earnestly complete the cultivation of morality and spirit from our daily lives. I hope that all compatriots across the country will strive unremittingly toward this goal. The ancients said, "If you can renovate yourself for one day, then do so day after day, and again day after day." This means that in our thoughts, spirit, and life, we must wash away all the stains of the old, so that we can be completely renewed, and then continue to seek renewal day by day, so as to cultivate the highest spirit and personality. Speaking of this, I would like to tell you, compatriots, that the "new" life we are going to implement, the so-called "new," is absolutely different from what is generally called "modern" or "fashionable." To implement the New Life Movement, we absolutely do not demand that all material enjoyments of what we eat, wear, live in, and use be novel, but that we constantly and thoroughly improve our living habits, actions, etc., so that our thoughts, morality, spirit, and personality are "new day after day," creating a new atmosphere of society and the whole country honoring propriety, valuing righteousness, abiding by integrity, and knowing shame. Once this new atmosphere is formed, a new society can be established. With a new society, a new country can naturally be established. Such a new country is a truly civilized, strong, and modern country. Guanzi said, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a country; if the four pillars are not upheld, the country will perish." We can also say from a positive perspective, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a country; if the four pillars are upheld, the country will be revived." Even a very small country can transform from poverty and weakness to wealth and strength in a short period and even dominate the world because it can understand propriety and righteousness and know integrity and shame. Our country is so large, with so many compatriots, and even more so with such a long and glorious history and a beautiful and great culture, and the intelligence and talent of our nation are no less than others. As long as we can restore the four pillars, there is no reason why we cannot immediately make the country rich and strong. As long as everyone works together with one heart and one mind and implements the New Life Movement consistently, and everyone becomes a modern citizen, making the atmosphere of society and the country new day by day and progressing day by day, we will certainly easily build a civilized and strong new country. Therefore, implementing the New Life Movement is the fundamental way for all our compatriots to save themselves and save the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to the New Life Movement, there is another most important thing for self-salvation and saving the country that we must all start from today and work especially hard to do. What is it? It is the "National Economic Construction Movement" that I proposed last year. This movement must be carried out simultaneously with the New Life Movement and complement each other. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to improve the people's living habits, thereby enhancing the people's morality and promoting the spirit of the nation, so as to improve the people's spiritual life and complete the spiritual construction of the country. The purpose of the National Economic Construction Movement is to develop the people's ability to work and create, increase the people's living materials, thereby improving the people's economic life, and complete the material construction of the country. Spiritual and material construction are interrelated, mutually influential, and mutually supportive. Neglecting one will make it difficult to succeed in both. Simultaneous progress will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, the National Economic Construction Movement and the New Life Movement must be carried out in tandem and will inevitably complement each other. We have already laid the foundation of national morality and spirit with the New Life Movement, and at the same time, we must complete the economic construction of the country with the National Economic Construction Movement and promote the progress of material civilization, so that the country can develop healthily, and so that we can save the country and revive the nation. Therefore, I hope that all compatriots across the country will remember at all times that these two movements are the most important central tasks for self-salvation and saving the country at present. Everyone must work together with one heart and one mind, strive for self-improvement, and unremittingly implement them. I believe that we can surely realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and complete the great cause of saving the country and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>Compatriots, you must understand that to save the country, we must have revolution, and revolution is to realize the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People takes "people's livelihood" as the center. What is the basis of people's livelihood? It is the economy. If the economy cannot develop, the people's livelihood cannot be improved. If the people's livelihood cannot be improved, the Three Principles of the People cannot be implemented. Therefore, to save the country and realize the Three Principles of the People, we must first strive for national economic construction to improve the people's livelihood, and the National Economic Construction Movement is the basic way for all our people to strive for national economic construction. I hope that our people across the country will work together. Now I will tell you about the implementation points and methods of the National Economic Construction Movement. First, revitalize agriculture. China has always been established on agriculture, and the people's livelihood and the country's survival are based on agriculture. Therefore, to engage in economic construction, the first important task is to revitalize agriculture. The method of revitalization is to adopt the method of rural cooperation, guided by cooperatives, and improve fertilizer production and seed selection, improve farming methods, invigorate rural finance, and streamline agricultural product marketing, to strive to increase agricultural production, with the initial goal of achieving self-sufficiency in food. In general, all daily necessities of the people across the country need no longer be purchased from foreign countries, in order to stop the drain and avoid the increasingly depleted national economy and people's livelihood. In order to achieve this goal, on the one hand, we must increase the production of agricultural raw materials to serve as the foundation for the development of national industries. At the same time, we must promote on-site processing and manufacturing, so that we can supply local needs at low prices, and further reduce transportation costs to supply various places. Second, encourage land reclamation and animal husbandry. Land is the source of all material production. To develop production, we must first "make the best use of the land." Therefore, all public and private wasteland must be reclaimed as much as possible. In areas with vast land and sparse population, we must encourage large-scale immigration, land reclamation, and livestock farming, and implement a military district land reclamation system, using collective labor to develop various agricultural benefits on a large scale. In addition, we must restore and increase rural by-products, such as livestock, horticulture, and fisheries. We should do our best to improve quality and increase production at the same time. Third, develop mineral resources. The Premier said, "The mining industry is the greatest cause of material civilization and economic progress." For decades, the reason why our material civilization and economic construction have not progressed is that the mining industry has not been developed, which is certainly the most direct and greatest reason. In the past, due to various obstacles in politics, economy, and society, the mining industry can be said to have achieved nothing. In the future, the government must adopt active protection and incentive policies, investigate the state of the mining industry, as well as the reasons that destroy and restrict the development of the mining industry, and improve various regulations concerning the mining industry, with the main purpose of reducing the burden, facilitating mining, encouraging mining investment, and supporting the independent operation and free development of mine owners. It is even more necessary to prohibit local governments and any special forces from controlling mining rights and competing with the people for profits. Moreover, because our country's financial resources are insufficient, we should welcome foreign investment to jointly develop China's mining industry. In this way, on the one hand, we can accommodate a large amount of labor and solve the problem of unemployment among compatriots, and at the same time, we can develop resources and promote the progress of material civilization. Fourth, promote compulsory labor. Compulsory labor is the most urgent way to implement national labor service to engage in national economic construction. Now our country is poor and does not have sufficient financial resources to complete various construction projects. Fortunately, we have many compatriots, and the labor of our compatriots is the most valuable economic driving force of the country, and the capital of all construction projects. As long as our people across the country can do their best to work, they can complete all the new construction projects that benefit the country and the people, save themselves and save the country, and fulfill their responsibilities to the country. The ancients said, "Educating the people with labor enriches them" and "Worry and labor invigorate the country," which is exactly the same as what we call labor service. I hope that compatriots across the country will understand this meaning together, support the government in implementing the compulsory labor system, and actively participate in voluntary labor. At least, we must first engage in basic work of local economic construction such as local development of transportation, water conservancy, forestry, and land reclamation with the efforts of local compatriots. In addition to the compulsory labor system, the government should simultaneously implement a military labor policy, using the labor of the army to supplement the shortcomings of the compulsory labor in various places. I believe that all construction projects in various places, if they receive the help of the army, will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Fifth, promote industry. If industry cannot develop, material civilization cannot progress and economic life cannot be satisfactory. Therefore, in addition to vigorously promoting agriculture, forestry, and mining, the most important thing is to strive for the development of industry. Our old-fashioned handicraft industry has already declined, and the new-style mechanical industry has not yet developed due to the oppression of foreign economies. Now, to seek ways to revitalize the declining industry, enrich the country, and enrich the people, on the one hand, we should promote simple rural industries and simple industries for processing and manufacturing agricultural products, and operate them in the countryside or its vicinity according to the cooperative system, in order to seek close connection and mutual development between agriculture and industry. On the one hand, the government should protect and reward general industries separately, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in national industrial products. At the same time, it is necessary to establish labor-capital adjustment agencies to fairly mediate all disputes between labor and capital and increase the interests of both parties. Such agencies must be given the power of final mandatory execution, in order to protect the safety of enterprises and the work of laborers. Sixth, adjust consumption. In our country, where production capacity is weak and all production industries are backward, various living materials are extremely scarce, and most of them must rely on foreign countries. Therefore, it creates economic septicemia in which rural funds are concentrated in cities and then transferred to foreign countries, so that the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, all industries are declining at the same time, and the most serious economic crisis is that the country is becoming increasingly poor. The only way to remedy this is to treat both the symptoms and the root cause. On the one hand, we must make the greatest efforts in the positive aspect to fundamentally increase the national production capacity and develop the national production industry. At the same time, we must make the greatest efforts in the negative aspect to save consumption as much as possible and adjust supply and demand. Compatriots, you must know that saving consumption can be done with just a change of mind, which is much easier than increasing production. However, this matter has the same effect on saving the country as increasing production. With such an easy, practical, and effective thing, how can we not strive to implement it? In short, in the future, we must strive to save consumption, adjust supply and demand, and prevent the outflow of funds from the mainland and rural areas, and further achieve the balance of foreign trade imports and exports. Seventh, streamline freight transportation. The basic condition for streamlined freight transportation is convenient transportation. Therefore, we must develop road transportation throughout the country as much as possible, improve the methods of water and land freight transportation, and at the same time, establish public warehouses and marketing agencies for major agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, rice, silk, and tea in various important areas, in order to store and transfer them. Eighth, adjust finance. Finance is the lifeline of the economy. If finance loses its normal state, all industries will suffer adverse effects. Therefore, adjusting finance is the most basic and most important task of national economic construction. When it comes to adjusting financial methods, it lies in encouraging private savings, invigorating the flow of funds, and responding to the requirements of the times. The government must implement a sound monetary policy, and the people across the country must absolutely trust the government and unanimously support its implementation.</p>
<p>The above eight items are the main tasks of the National Economic Construction Movement. Many of them are very simple, practical, and easy to do, and anyone can do them. If the people across the country can consistently follow these principles and do them practically, I believe that not only can our own lives become stable as a result, but also the entire economic national crisis can be quickly broken through, and the country will gradually move towards the realm of wealth and strength. Otherwise, the national economy will have no way to be built, the people's livelihood problem will not be solved, and everyone will only become poorer day by day, and even the majority of the people will suffer from hunger and cold, and their lives will not be stable. Then, society and the country will only become more chaotic and dangerous, and cannot be saved. Therefore, everyone must deeply recognize that this movement is the most important task for self-salvation and saving the country at present. From today onwards, we must work together to strive for advancement and earnestly implement it. At the same time, we must support and urge the government to do its best to implement it. In this way, our country can be immediately saved by these basic tasks. Everyone must understand that our intelligence and talent are as sound as foreigners, and our population is larger than any other country. Things that they do in five or ten years can be accomplished in one year if we work together with one heart and one mind. Therefore, we are not afraid of how poor or weak the country is, or how dangerous it is, but only that we have intelligent brains and great strength, but we are unwilling to use them and do not know how to develop them to the fullest. We are only afraid that our compatriots still do not have the concept of the country and the nation, do not understand their responsibilities, do not fulfill their obligations, do not abide by discipline, and cannot unite as a group. Especially for everything, we cannot do it practically. If we do not do it, of course nothing will succeed. If we can do it, I think there is nothing truly difficult in the world. Now that the country has reached such a critical point of survival, to be able to save ourselves and save the country, the only way is for our 400 million compatriots to promote the New Life Movement on the one hand, so that everyone becomes a modern citizen, in order to build the foundation of the national spirit. On the other hand, we must work together to promote the National Economic Construction Movement, so that everyone can fulfill the obligation of labor and develop the nation's production capacity, building the foundation of the country's material. Thus, these two movements, which emphasize both mind and matter, and combine substance and function, are the most important methods for implementing the Three Principles of the People, and the most practical way for all our compatriots to save themselves and save the country. I hope that everyone will make great vows from today onwards and strive to implement them. In particular, people of the intellectual class must take on the responsibility of leadership, lead by example, and advocate with all their strength, so that the people across the country will follow this path and work together to do the work of self-salvation and saving the country. Our 400 million compatriots are all descendants of the same ancestor, all of the same flesh and blood, and should have the love of brothers and sisters. Everyone's interests are closely related, and we share the same fate. At this critical moment of the country's life and death, the only way is to be of one heart and one mind, to be self-reliant and self-strengthening, to unite sincerely, to support the central government, and to strive forward towards the overall goal of saving the country. We are not afraid of any foreign aggression, and we can break through any danger. The Three Principles of the People will surely be realized by our hands, the Republic of China will surely be saved, and the Chinese nation will surely be revived. In this way, we individuals can be said to be modern citizens, fulfilling the important responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future for the citizens of the Republic of China, and we can be worthy of our ancestors and comfort the spirit of our Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in heaven. What I have said to our compatriots across the country today is these few words. I hope that all of you will strive together and actively work hard to achieve them. I wish you all health and success, and I wish our Republic of China long live, long live, long live! (End)</p>

<h3>Broadcasting and China's Unification</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>On New Year's Day this year, Chairman Lin Zichao of the National Government and Premier Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan broadcast their New Year's speeches to 400 million people across China and to various ethnic groups in Asia via the Central Broadcasting Radio Station. On that day, dozens of radio broadcasting stations across China simultaneously broadcast these speeches. Wherever Chinese people are found, whether in border areas or in Southeast Asia, they can use this new scientific tool to receive the sound transmitted from Nanjing in the air, as if gathering in the same room with China's political leaders. This phenomenon, its benefit to national unity and the effectiveness of national unification, can be said to be immeasurable.</p>
<p>The unification of a country depends on the people having a unified consciousness, a unified understanding, and a unified determination. The most effective tools for building this kind of unified psychology are news media and broadcasting. After the war, emerging countries spared no effort in promoting nationalism through these two tools, making full use of them for effective control. However, news media are not as powerful as radio in mobilizing national sentiment, because seeing people through writing is not as good as communicating with people through language. Moreover, there are not many literate people in China, and transportation is inconvenient. Disseminating an opinion or order throughout China cannot be done immediately through newspapers. Radio is not limited by time and space. Once a word is spoken, the whole country can hear it. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness can all be aroused by the speaker's effect, resulting in the direct reaction of the listeners. China has a vast territory, and people's thoughts and opinions vary. To make the people aware of the country and the government, and to make the people aware of the ways to work for the country, radio broadcasting should be used more actively in the future, so that Nanjing's largest broadcasting station in Asia can fully play its function in building a unified national psychology and a strong national consciousness.</p>
<p>Looking broadly at the efforts and successes of various countries in broadcasting in recent years, after the Soviet revolution, radio was used as a tool to build a new civilization and promote a new political and economic system. Moscow has a broadcasting station ten times larger than Nanjing's. Observers say that Hitler's victory in Germany was thanks to the radio broadcasting industry. Even in the democratic United States, the president makes active use of radio broadcasting at all times. Whenever Roosevelt has political opinions to express, he instructs hundreds of radio stations across the United States to simultaneously broadcast his speeches to the people. China's Nanjing radio station has considerable power, but having a large radio station without a sufficient number of radios, or having radios without valuable programs, is still of no avail. To achieve psychological unification in China, improving and expanding the radio broadcasting industry is a pressing task at present.</p>
<h3>Five-Nation Representatives Gather in London: Naval Conference Reopens Today</h3>
<p>Quantitative Restrictions Difficult to Compromise</p>
<p>London - The Naval Conference in London, which adjourned on December 20 last year, is scheduled to reconvene on the 6th of this month. The delegations from the United States, Japan, and Italy previously spent the New Year elsewhere and have now returned here. As no extensive preparations are required for the resumption of the conference, most of the representatives will be able to take time off in the next two days to play golf and relax. All the delegations believe that the negotiations after the resumption of the conference must be conducted actively. "The quantitative restriction agreement is likely to be established, and must be determined as soon as possible. If it cannot be established, then the issue of qualitative restrictions should be discussed. It is generally believed that if no agreement can be reached, the Naval Conference will end quickly," it is said. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>London - The Naval Disarmament Conference is scheduled to reopen on the 6th as planned. The chair will be taken by the new Foreign Secretary Eden. During the adjournment, no sign of compromise was found, so there is fear that the final breakup will be faster than expected. (Domei dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Beauty Legislator Opposes Japanese Rayon Entering the Philippines</h3>
<p>Washington - Republican Congresswoman Rogers opposed the import of Japanese rayon into the Philippine Islands today, claiming that it should be subject to the same restrictions as textiles. Mrs. Rogers has requested the State Department to find ways to control the competition of Japanese rayon in the Philippines, especially Japanese rayon transshipped from China to the Philippines and rayon manufactured by Japanese merchants in China. (Kokumin dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Germany to Establish Embassy in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Berlin - The Philippines established an autonomous government on November 15 of last year. It is heard that Germany will establish a legation in Manila in the shortest possible time. The first minister to be appointed will be Knipp, the former consul-general in New York. According to reports, in October of last year, Germany dispatched an economic survey mission to the Far East, and Knipp was a member of the mission. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Remarks Aimed at Promoting Peace</h3>
<p>Opposing Aggression, Emphasizing the Actions of Italy and Japan, Revising International Treaties, Door Not Closed</p>
<p>Washington - Diplomatic circles and the State Department today generally believe that President Roosevelt's message is the strongest statement on foreign affairs by an American president since President Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany. It is reported that President Roosevelt's remarks were made to promote neutrality legislation. Diplomatic circles believe that what the President meant was the actions of Italy against Abyssinia, Japan against China, and Germany's rearmament, and publicly proposed the union of Western Hemisphere countries to seek world peace. (Kokumin dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>London - Observers here today believe that President Roosevelt, through his message to Congress, has facilitated the possibility of passing an oil embargo against Italy, and has encouraged countries that do not engage in aggression. A government spokesman said, "President Roosevelt's message, while avoiding disputes, also clearly declares that the United States will use its enormous power in the world to oppose countries seeking new conquests." It is also believed here that the President has not closed the door to revising treaties by peaceful means. (Kokumin dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Paris - A government spokesman declared today that he fully agreed with President Roosevelt's message, calling it "a call for calm reason." French newspapers have given good reviews to President Roosevelt's criticism of dictatorial politics. (Kokumin dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Differing Perspectives from Various Nations</h3>
<p>Rome Anxious, German Press Critical, Paris Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>Paris - According to sources in Rome, the Italian government fears that President Roosevelt's speech signals a potential reduction in US oil supplies to Italy. Italy relies heavily on US oil to continue its war efforts. A reduction to pre-war levels would significantly hinder Italy. However, many Italians believe that if the US acknowledges the principle of supplying warring nations with a certain amount of gasoline, it will be difficult to limit that quantity. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome - Official circles have made no statement regarding President Roosevelt's address to Congress. However, the general sentiment here is one of agreement. President Roosevelt clearly stated that kerosene would continue to be exported within normal peacetime limits, making a global oil embargo difficult to achieve. Furthermore, news from London indicates that the British government does not intend to be the first to advocate for stricter sanctions at the League of Nations. This news strengthens hopes that an oil embargo will not materialize. Moreover, US oil imports account for only one-sixth of Italy's total kerosene imports. Currently, Italy's kerosene supply, combining domestic reserves and existing orders, is ample enough to cope with future events. Even if consumption exceeds normal levels due to unforeseen circumstances, normal US imports would suffice. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Various circles here have criticized President Roosevelt's address to Congress. The semi-official Diplomatic and Political Correspondence stated, "The US desire not to profit from other nations' wars aligns with Germany's stance since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War." Political figures emphasized the new Neutrality Act to be discussed after Congress reconvenes, calling it a new concept of wartime neutrality, treating all belligerents equally. Regarding President Roosevelt's statement about "dictators of foreign lands, who enslave their people and drive them onto the battlefield," newspapers refrained from praise or criticism. However, the Nazi Party organ, "Angriff," commented, "President Roosevelt's tone suggests genuine moral conscience, perhaps possible under the American democratic banner. However, dictatorial nations are merely bombs threatening the world. England and America consistently compare Stalin of Soviet Russia, Hitler of Germany, and Mussolini of Italy to those who champion democratic ideals, claiming they are diametrically opposed. This view is widespread, proving that England and America still do not understand the true nature of political systems outside their own framework." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London - A spokesman for the Berlin Foreign Office criticized President Roosevelt's address to Congress, which implied that some nations are destroying democratic public opinion and displaying dictatorial aggression. He stated that Roosevelt's remarks were not directed at Germany, as Germany had done nothing to warrant such comments. He further stated that Germany's dictatorship is completely different from others, implying that Roosevelt was thinking of other nations when he made his statement. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin - President Roosevelt's address to Congress has angered the German press. The Angriff newspaper called the speech ridiculous, demonstrating the US's superficial understanding of dictatorial nations. It also claimed that the Nazi government had reached an understanding with Poland, relinquishing all territorial claims against France, and had reached a naval understanding with Britain. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris - The French are delighted by President Roosevelt's criticism of Mussolini's dictatorship in his address to Congress. They are now questioning the influence of Roosevelt's statement on Geneva's decision regarding an oil embargo against Italy. The newspaper "Le Temps" believes the pro-sanctions faction will become more assertive. "Journal des Débats" suggests the implementation of the American Neutrality Act will turn the Kellogg-Briand Pact into a laughingstock, greatly benefiting nations whose primary industry is war. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris - The newspaper "Le Temps" recently commented on President Roosevelt's message to Congress, stating, "In future global conflicts, one cannot reasonably expect the US to intervene and cooperate with other nations defending justice and freedom, as it did during the European War. Furthermore, in accordance with the spirit of wartime neutrality, nations fighting to protect their rights and independent existence, as well as those seeking to conquer others and engage in aggression, cannot rely on the US to supply munitions or essential raw materials. This situation will greatly alter all future wars of defense or aggression. Under these circumstances, all nations must plan carefully in terms of domestic industry, so that in times of crisis, those previously reliant on US products must find alternative solutions. This will encourage nations to pursue self-sufficiency. Moreover, with US raw material supplies unreliable during wartime, raw material-producing countries, especially Soviet Russia, stand to benefit." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>New US Neutrality Act More Flexible</h3>
<p>Grants President Broad Powers to Act Based on Aggressor's Actions</p>
<p>Washington - Representative McReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, yesterday introduced a new Neutrality Act to the House of Representatives, proposing amendments to the current law to make it a permanent neutrality law. According to political observers here, President Roosevelt's interpretation and implementation of this law can be gleaned from his address to Congress yesterday. The new Neutrality Act proposed by McReynolds grants the President broad "discretionary" powers, unlike the strict "mandatory" nature of the current law (referring to measures that must be taken). According to the new law, items not purely for war but usable in war, such as kerosene, copper, and cotton, should be prohibited from being transported to belligerent nations, to be decided by the President's discretion. The President's ability to use this power to expand the list of embargoed items is intended to "ensure American security, maintain American neutrality, and prevent the expansion and prolongation of war." Once international conflicts occur, the US President will have the power to act at his discretion and the flexibility to adjust his actions, which is of utmost importance. In his address, the President harshly criticized "aggressive dictatorships," stating that these nations alone bear the responsibility for brewing war. Conversely, he stated that nations that "consistently uphold democracy" are those who cherish peace. Upon careful examination of the President's words, it is feared that war may break out in both Europe and the Far East, thus revealing the future "aggressor nations" in advance. From this perspective, once an international war occurs, President Roosevelt will distinguish between the severity of the belligerents' responsibilities as the standard for the scope of the Neutrality Act's implementation. For aggressor nations, all provisions of the Neutrality Act will be strictly enforced without leniency. For attacked nations, only the "mandatory" or prescribed measures of the Neutrality Act will be implemented, and not others. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris - After receiving detailed information about President Roosevelt's address to Congress, responsible parties here have commented extensively on the new Neutrality Act under discussion in the US Congress. These individuals value the law itself, rather than Roosevelt's speech. Firstly, the law demonstrates the American people's strong desire to maintain neutrality and protect peace with all their might. Secondly, viewing the provisions of the law, the traditional American concept of freedom of the seas may be revised. If the law is passed, it will grant the President new privileges, allowing him to expand the list of embargoed items beyond the current ban on munitions, including items the President deems prolonging war for belligerent nations. Therefore, the authorities may implement a naval blockade, extending the effectiveness of the blockade to their own ships. This result would make the Neutrality Act effective. And if this becomes a reality, it may have a significant impact on actions in Geneva, as the implementation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant may also adopt a naval blockade to deal with aggressor nations. However, regarding this matter, Britain has not yet dared to attempt it lightly, lest upholding the American argument for freedom of the seas lead to disputes between the two countries. But if the new American Neutrality Act is completed, this difficulty can be resolved. However, if the League decides to postpone the implementation of certain embargo measures, the American President's planned embargo measures against both belligerent parties may be affected. The above is a general expression of opinion from official circles regarding the new Neutrality Act, refraining from commenting on its relationship to the Italo-Abyssinian War. The current US Neutrality Act, established on September 1st last year, will expire at the end of February this year, stipulating only the embargo of war materials to belligerent nations. Representative McReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced the new bill to the House on the 3rd (details already seen in yesterday's telegram). (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Congressional Agenda</h3>
<p>Neutrality Act to be Discussed Quickly, Budget Imbalance Persists</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate Majority Party Agenda Committee today decided to expedite the consideration of the Veterans' Bonus and Neutrality Acts. The committee has authorized Senator Robinson to consult with President Roosevelt to find a compromise on the Bonus Act, and authorized Senator Pittman to submit the Neutrality Act to the Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - Congress will adjourn until Monday, when it will receive President Roosevelt's budget message. The message will likely indicate progress in the budget, but the imbalance between revenue and expenditure will persist. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned today that opposing factions of the Pittman Bonus Act have temporarily agreed to support Mr. Vincent's plan and fight together in the House of Representatives. After its passage, the method of payment will be discussed. Mr. Vincent's plan does not specify the method of payment, but only requests the payment of the bonus. The 21-member Pittman Bonus Act Committee will meet on Monday to decide whether to abandon or persist with inflation, or postpone this dispute until after the Bonus Act is passed. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to influential sources close to President Roosevelt, the President has decided to temporarily refrain from proposing social reform legislation, as he will be engaging in political campaigning in the coming months. The President is prepared to use his past achievements as the standard for his re-election. It is understood that the President intends to remain silent until the summer campaign begins, then present his new proposals to the voters, allowing them to freely choose whether to re-elect Roosevelt to continue reforms or elect his political opponents to overthrow his "New Deal."

<h3>US Private Company Profits, Supplies Military Aircraft to Bolivia</h3>
<p>Indicted Last Summer for Violations, Neutrality Act a Litmus Test</p>
<p>Washington - The US-based Stanba Aircraft Company previously disregarded the prohibition and sold four bomber aircraft to Bolivia (when the Chaco War had not yet ceased, the US government explicitly prohibited the transport of all military supplies to both Bolivia and Paraguay). Ostensibly, they were intended for use on the New Orleans-Mexico air route. After the aircraft were shipped out, the company ceased operations to evade responsibility. At the time, the State Department was caught off guard and unable to intercept them. Later, after obtaining the consent of the Peruvian government, it was agreed to detain the aircraft when they passed through that country. This happened last summer. Subsequently, the judicial authorities conducted an investigation into the case, learning that Stanba Company was a subsidiary of the well-known Curtiss Aircraft Factory. According to the State Department, the Bolivian consul in New York had participated in the sale. The Curtiss factory authorities were then prosecuted. The factory authorities refused to answer some important questions, and the State Department and the Department of Justice wanted to ask the Bolivian consul to testify, but were refused, resulting in a deadlock in the lawsuit. According to the US-Bolivian treaty, the US government cannot compel Bolivian civil servants to appear in court to testify. State Department officials now hope that the Bolivian government will assist, so that the truth of the case can be revealed. The State Department believes that the nature of this case is important, and is related to various countries in South America and Europe, and can be a litmus test for the new Neutrality Act. Generally, it is believed that if American companies violate the Neutrality Act and the American government cannot obtain the testimony of foreign civil servants residing in the United States, it will be difficult for the implementation of the Neutrality Act to be effective.

<h3>Abyssinia Requests League of Nations to Conduct Impartial Investigation of Italian Military's Brutal Tactics</h3>
<p>Repeated Violations of Wartime Laws, Over 200,000 Italian Troops in East Africa</p>
<p>Geneva - The Abyssinian government has submitted a note to the League of Nations, requesting an impartial investigation into the methods of warfare used by the Italian and Abyssinian armies. It is alleged that Italian troops have repeatedly violated wartime laws, and the Abyssinian government has repeatedly reported them to the League of Nations. The Tenth Committee of the Administrative Council, having been entrusted by the Administrative Council to monitor the entire Italo-Abyssinian dispute, should conduct an investigation to determine right and wrong. It also stated, "The Italian government has issued a statement through its newspapers, stating that it will continue the war without leniency until it has annihilated the Abyssinian army. The Abyssinian government urgently implores the League of Nations to prevent the brutal acts of the Italian army, as if these brutal acts are allowed to occur without intervention, the restoration of peace in East Africa will face the most serious difficulties, and the adverse effects on the entire African continent will be unpredictable." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Our reporter, Auchinate, reports that Italian aircraft on the northern front carried out bombings near the city of Maigale on December 31st of last year, dropping a total of 3,000 bombs. At the time, only eight Abyssinian soldiers, two civilians, were killed and 15 were injured. It is generally believed that the Abyssinian army on the northern front began attacking the Italian army on December 5th, but the result is currently unknown. Italian aircraft heavily bombed the line of defense near the city of Maigale in order to prevent its advance and prevent the city from being besieged. In fact, most of the bombs dropped were grenades. Our casualties were definitely not so small. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to reliable sources from the "Berliner Tageblatt" correspondent in Rome, General Badoglio wants to increase the number of troops, is taking the offensive in the front, as a number of defensive positions urgently require an appropriate force to defend. There are 250,000 Italian troops in East Africa, but according to the Suez Canal Company's estimation, 35,000 wounded or sick troops have been transported back to their home country. In addition, the total number of deaths and those being treated in hospitals is more than 50,000. Therefore, outsiders predict that the Italian government will increase the number of troops in East Africa by 100,000 or 150,000. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Five Italian Aircraft Continue to Attack Red Cross</h3>
<p>Egyptian Rescue Team Bombed</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Our reporter, Auchinate, reports that five Italian aircraft bombed the city of Dagabur in the province of Wogaden in the south at 8:30 this morning, and attacked the rescue team near the city.

<p>Addis Ababa - Our reporter, Auchinate, reports that at 8:30 yesterday morning, Italian aircraft bombed a Red Cross rescue team near the city of Dagabur in the south. It was previously reported that the bombed rescue team was an American rescue team. It is now known that it was the Egyptian Red Cross rescue team, which suffered significant losses. Regarding this matter, the government issued a public statement saying, "Italian aircraft continue to wage war against the Red Cross," and that the Egyptian Red Cross rescue team's location in the city of Dagabur is far from the military camp, and there is no possibility of misunderstanding. After the Italian aircraft bombed, they also used machine guns to strafe, causing significant losses to the rescue team. The team includes two Egyptian doctors and two British staff members.

<h3>Sweden Receives Report of Rescue Team Being Bombed</h3>
<p>Government Discusses Response Measures</p>
<p>Sweden - On December 30th of last year, Italian aircraft bombed the Swedish Red Cross rescue team in the southern city of Doro in Abyssinia. Regarding this matter, British Minister to Abyssinia, Sir Barton, has submitted a first report to the Swedish government based on a telegram issued by General Destay, commander of the southern Abyssinian army (Sweden originally had no diplomatic representatives stationed in the capital of Abyssinia, and requested the British Minister to investigate the incident). It is said that the Swedish rescue team all have Red Cross flags, and Italian aircraft have repeatedly flown over them without attacking them. Until the morning of December 30th, twelve Italian aircraft flew in formation, about 300 meters above the ground, and suddenly dropped gas bombs and shrapnel bombs on the rescue team, and used machine guns to strafe. After learning of this report, the Swedish Foreign Ministry issued a public statement saying that the Swedish Consul in the capital of Abyssinia will inquire with the members of the rescue team and submit a supplementary report to the government. Once this report arrives, a response plan will be decided. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Sweden - The Swedish people are increasingly indignant that the deputy medical officer of the Swedish Red Cross rescue team, Mr. Lunts Tröm, who was injured in an Italian aircraft attack, died yesterday due to serious injuries. One newspaper advocated that Britain, France and the United States may take action on this, which may be the last nail in the coffin of Mussolini's imperial dream. Another newspaper said that the collapse of the fascist government and the end of the Italian war policy are also within expectations. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italian-French Diplomatic Contact</h3>
<p>Public Opinion in Rome Becomes More Moderate</p>
<p>Paris - According to news received by the "Le Journal" correspondent in Rome, the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerutti, who is currently on vacation in his home country, met with the French Ambassador to Italy, Chambrun. The two sides were very cordial. However, it is expected that this meeting will not have any new developments in the current situation. Chambrun has now set off to return home. The correspondent also said that most Italian public opinion is now more moderate. For example, the "Fascist Regime" newspaper stated that if the League of Nations can put forward new peace proposals at this time, it is the best way to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.

<h3>Talking About Red Leaves (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chu</p>
<p>The red leaves seen in spring are mostly newly grown, tender leaves. Common examples include plants of the Acer, Rhododendron, and Pistacia genera. According to most scholars, the purpose of these tender leaves turning red is to shield them from excessively strong sunlight, thereby protecting the delicate tissues. This is because while sunlight is a necessary driving force for plant life, each plant has its own specific light requirement, that is, a certain optimum. If the light is too strong and exceeds the optimum, or if the light is too weak and falls short of the optimum, it can be harmful to the plant. The reason why trees in the spring often have red or light red new leaves is to prevent the penetration of excessively strong light, so as to avoid the decomposition of chlorophyll. What about the red leaves in autumn? There are two exactly opposite theories to explain why leaves turn red in the fall: the first theory states that the red anthocyanins have two functions: (1) the red color can shield the plant from harmful, strong light, allowing chemical changes within the leaf to proceed smoothly without obstruction, which is the same as the explanation for red leaves in spring. (2) The red color can absorb a lot of heat from the red rays of light, increasing the temperature inside the leaf and promoting chemical changes. In other words, it allows the important chemical compounds inside the leaf to be completely broken down and transported to the stem for storage, so as to avoid being lost with the fallen leaves in autumn and winter. However, another theory is completely different. This theory states that red leaves are merely a physiological response of the plant to seasonal changes, and do not bring any benefit to the plant itself. There is really no great significance as to why it is like this. The reason why they release beautiful colors before withering is like the afterglow of the setting sun, which is completely different from the purpose of flowers displaying beautiful colors to attract insects. It can be said that there is no definitive conclusion as to which of the two theories is right or wrong.</p>
<p>People often confuse red leaves with maple leaves, and almost assume that all red leaves are maple leaves. In fact, the leaves of many plants turn red, not just maple leaves. Pistacia chinensis, Acer buergerianum, Acer palmatum, Acer japonicum, Rhaphiolepis indica, Sapium sebiferum, Nandina domestica, Celtis sinensis, Ulmus parvifolia, Betula, and others are also common tree species with red leaves in the autumn. We will now present several species and simply illustrate the shapes of their leaves, so that you will not think of them as maple leaves when you see red leaves in the future.</p>
<p>(1) Maple</p>
<p>The maple tree, also known as fragrant maple or Liquidambar formosana, belongs to the Hamamelidaceae family. This is the true maple tree. It often grows into a large tree with alternate leaves. The fruit is a drooping, spiky ball.</p>
<p>(2) Trident Maple</p>
<p>Also known as Acer buergerianum, it belongs to the Aceraceae family. Farmers often plant it as a hedge. It rarely grows into a large tree. It is most easily confused with (1), but the leaves of the trident maple are opposite and the fruit is a winged fruit, which are very different from maple.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese Tallow Tree</p>
<p>Sapium sebiferum is quite common in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The leaves are heart-shaped and easily recognizable. When its fruit splits open, you can see three white, waxy-coated seeds. The oil extracted from the seeds can be used to make candles, soap, and for lighting lamps. The leaves can also be used as a black silk dye.</p>
<p>(4) Indian Hawthorn</p>
<p>Indian Hawthorn is often planted in cemeteries. The tree shape is rounded and beautiful. The leaves are thick and have fine thorns on the edges. In autumn and winter, some of the leaves turn red, which is extremely bright.</p>
<p>(5) Chinese Pistache</p>
<p>This is a compound leaf. The base of the leaflets is skewed and asymmetrical. In spring, the newly emerged leaves are as red and bright as the head of an oriole. The tender leaves are fragrant and can be used as a substitute for tea. Some people pickle them with salt and sell them as Chinese Pistache tea. In Shandong, it is called the "kai" tree. It is said that the statue of Confucius in the Confucius Temple in Qufu is made of this wood.</p>
<p>(6) Finally, let me introduce the most beautiful red leaf, which is the Acer palmatum. It also belongs to the Aceraceae family. It has winged fruits and seven-lobed leaves. The new leaves and autumn leaves turn red. Pressed and displayed in books or framed, they are absolutely beautiful. There is also a type with five-lobed leaves, which is also quite beautiful.</p>

<h3>Mediterranean Region: Past and Present of British Policy</h3>
<p>Italy Decides to Move Forward with Current Policy</p>
<p>Rome - Senate President Volpi, in a speech at the International Political Science Society in Milan today, stated that in the past, Britain, in view of the development of French and Russian forces in the Mediterranean, had sought to unite with Italy to jointly resist France and Russia. Since the European War, the combined French and Russian forces in the Mediterranean have declined, and British policy has also changed accordingly. This situation has become increasingly apparent, especially after the success of the Fascist revolution and the further consolidation of Italy's position due to the Franco-Italian understanding. Volpi further stated that Italy is determined to complete its current policy, and is not concerned about British opposition. He also said, "The new Italy is a political entity in the Mediterranean that cannot be suppressed. Italy is a country with 44 million people and must move forward. Who can force it to give up its progress? It should be known that Italy's aspirations for Africa do not harm British interests. This has been repeatedly and clearly expressed by the leaders of the Italian government. Italy does not want to weaken Britain's position, because this kind of attempt would affect the situation in Europe and would be harmful to Italy." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Fiscal Panic</h3>
<p>National and Local Debts Increase Annually, Lame Finances Lead to Lame Economy</p>
<p>Hwa-Lien News Agency Special Article - The stability or panic of a country's finances is a reflection of the good or bad economic situation of that country. From Japan's fiscal panic, we can see the crisis in the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>Since the September 18 Incident in 1931, as a result of Japan's unreasonable expansion of its finances, the financial situation has been exhausted to the extreme. Looking at the newly annexed Manchuria, it is suffering from a lack of investment. It is said that in order to restore order, the special expenses used in the past four years have further increased the financial instability of the Japanese state.</p>
<p>Speaking of national debt, it has changed from 5.055 billion yen in September 1931 to 9.7644 billion yen in August last year. If we add the 50 million yen in treasury securities and the 528 million yen in rice securities, then, in the past four years, just in terms of the central government's public debt, it has increased from 6.187 billion yen to 10.342 billion yen, an increase of 4.155 billion yen.</p>
<p>Looking at local debt, it was 1.6885 billion yen in 1931, and it increased to 2.4447 billion yen in June last year, that is, an increase of 76.2%. That is to say, the total amount of public debt in Japan's finances has increased to more than 5 billion yen. This more than 5 billion yen of public debt is forcibly distributed to banks and then transferred to the already unsustainable burden of the Japanese toiling masses. At the end of 1931, the national debt amount stored in the bank's treasury was only 1.811 billion yen, but in July of last year, it suddenly increased to 4.146 billion yen. Adding the 443 million yen in local debt and the huge amount of capital invested in national debt by insurance companies, the number is even more considerable.</p>
<p>Looking at the deposits in Japan's deposit department, they have indeed increased in recent years. However, the increase in both new and old deposits has been used by the national treasury to increase national debt. Even the government's various corporate bonds have been included in the treasury of the deposit department. The total deposit amount is about 3.2 billion yen, but the capital used for government securities is 3.5 billion yen. Even the reserves have been misappropriated. In short, the public debt accumulated in the treasuries of Japanese financial groups is about 12.8 billion yen. As for the majority of the funds of Japanese banks, they are also absorbed into other securities. In July last year, the investment in stocks and bonds of Japanese private bank companies was 2.404 billion yen, credit companies 596 million yen, and insurance companies 800 million yen. It is estimated that two-thirds of Japan's entire financial capital is solidified in various securities. The excessive amount of securities illustrates the urgency of Japan's finances. Moreover, in general, the value of bonds indicates a continuous decline. There is also the expansion of Japanese banknotes and currency. To give an example, in September 1921, the amount of silver banknotes issued was 1.054 billion yen. By July last year, it had increased to 1.202 billion yen. The amount of banknotes issued by the Fresh Silver Bank increased from 100 million yen to 147 million yen. The amount issued by the Taiwan Bank increased from 44 million yen to 45 million yen. This uneven increase is the focus of the conflict of interest among Japanese financial giants themselves.</p>
<p>Before the compilation of the Japanese fiscal budget for this year, Finance Minister Takahashi insisted on no longer increasing public debt and adopted the "dualism of military and financial resources." However, as a result, out of the total expenditure of 2.278 billion yen in the general accounting budget, the army and navy military expenses accounted for 1.059 billion yen, that is, 46.5% of the total expenditure. That is, the military expenditure for this year has increased by 38 million yen compared to last year. On the other hand, the expenses of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which are frequently in bankruptcy panic and need to be rescued, were 123 million yen in Showa 9 (1934), but decreased to 93 million yen last year (Showa 10), and further decreased to 90 million yen this year.</p>
<p>In this way, Japan's lame finances are further promoting the transformation of a lame economy. Only a small part of the military demand industry has received a little bit of profit. The majority of the rural economy, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators, and the toiling masses are further trapped in a quagmire of hardship. Japan's fiscal panic has fully pointed out the crisis in the Japanese economy, explaining that Japan's internal strength is really empty to the extreme.</p>
<h3>Xu Fu Arrives in the Fujian Capital from Xiamen</h3>

Regarding the request of the Xixi Chengpu Tai Chamber of Commerce's rice industry to abolish the rice tax in Zhangzhou, he only agreed that the tax rate could be reduced from 50 cents per bag to 40 cents, because it was to compensate for the abolition of the exorbitant miscellaneous regimental expenses and could not be abolished.

It is reported that the method of setting up warehouses in groups to preside over grain storage will be completed by June. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>New Year's Day Reception: Kuling British Concession</h3>
<p>The Lushan Administration Director and the British Consul in Hankou Jointly Signed 14 Articles of Agreement for Return</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - Lushan is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, only 45 li from Jiujiang. You can take a car from Jiujiang directly to Lianhua Cave and then take a sedan chair to climb the mountain. Transportation is convenient. The mountain has nine layers, and the peaks are inserted into the sky. It is vast and majestic, almost unparalleled in the southeast. Kuling is located in the northwest of Lushan. The scenery is quiet and is considered a giant. Since Chinese and foreign people gathered to escape the summer heat, various constructions have been modernized. Western-style houses stand all over the mountains. As for the process of leasing it to foreigners, it can be traced back to the eleventh year of Guangxu (1885 AD). An English missionary, Lide Li, happened to travel here and was extremely envious of its beautiful scenery. He then tried to purchase land in the Changheng area of ​​Kuling from the Chinese to build houses and roads. When the local gentry learned about it, the interference was ineffective. It was not until the twenty-first year of Guangxu that the lease was officially established. The British then focused on operations, using the excuse of escaping the summer heat to expand it. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, they re-signed the expanded lease. As a result, the British also established the Kuling Company to exercise political power. By this time, the British had formed a mature lease in Kuling.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Army recovered the Yangtze River area and recovered part of the police power. In the twenty-second year, the Lushan Administration was reorganized, and all matters progressed rapidly. The British expressed their intention to return the leased summer resort. At the beginning of August in the twenty-third year, the director of the Lushan Administration, Chiang Chih-cheng, and the British Consul General in Hankou, He Lide, began discussing the return method. Later, He Lide was transferred back to his country, so the current Consul General in Hankou, Moose, continued the negotiations. After several twists and turns, the draft agreement was signed in September of the twenty-fourth year and approved by the Chinese and British governments. On December 30, Director Chiang and the British Consul Moose signed the original agreement, with a total of 14 articles. The content is extremely fair, and the interests of Chinese and foreign residents have been taken into consideration. It is completely managed by our country. The handover procedures were completed on New Year's Day. The Lushan Administration will also move to the original site of the Kuling Company. It is also heard that the Central Government has decided to allocate 100,000 yuan each year for the Lushan business, planning to actively build it. (January 2)</p>
<h3>Minister of Railways Chang Chia-ao Arrives in Peiping</h3>
<p>Railway Department Consultant Shen Chang and Others Accompanied to Inspect the Peiping-Suiyuan, Peiping-Liaoning, and Tientsin-Pukou Railways</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence - Minister of Railways Chang Chia-ao arrived in Peiping at 8:00 am on the 3rd, passing through Tianjin from Beijing. Secretary Yang Yi-zhi, Railway Department Consultant Shen Chang, Director of the Peiping-Hankou Railway Bureau Chen Yan-jiong, and others accompanied him. The Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, Song Zheyuan, the Mayor of Peiping, Qin Dechun, the Mayor of Tianjin, Xiao Zhenying, the Director of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway Bureau, Zhang Weifan, the Diplomatic Commissioner, Cheng Xi-geng, and important figures from the banking industry, as well as important officials from various railway bureaus, a total of more than 100 people, went to the station to greet him. There was also a military band from the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters playing music at the station to welcome him. After Chang got off the car, Shen Chang introduced him to shake hands with Song Zheyuan and meet him, and shook hands with other welcomers to greet them. Then Chang and Song and Shen took a car to the Beijing Hotel together. Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying also followed. After arriving at the hotel, Chang met with Song, Qin, and Xiao for about half an hour. After Song and others left, Chang met with Cheng Xi-geng, Guan Geng-lin, and others. At 12:00 noon, Xiao Zhenying hosted a banquet at his private residence in Beibingmashi to welcome Chang.</p>
<p>After Chang arrived in Peiping, he made the following remarks: "I am new to the department and do not know much about the situation of the various railways. I believe that on-site inspections will make it easier to understand the actual situation of the railway affairs in various places. The purpose of this inspection of the various railways is the same. Also, because railway affairs are often related to the local situation, Chairman Song has always been enthusiastic about railway affairs. Recently, I received a telegram invitation and took the opportunity of the New Year holiday to go north to inspect the various railways and to meet with Chairman Song and the various members. I am very happy privately. I will first inspect the Peiping-Suiyuan and Peiping-Liaoning Railways. If time permits, I will visit the Longhai and Jiaoji Railways." According to Chang's secretary, Yang Yi-zhi, "Chang set off north from Beijing at 11:00 pm on New Year's Day. After arriving in Peiping, he will stay for two or three days and then go to inspect the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway. After finishing, he will leave Peiping for Tianjin to inspect the Peiping-Liaoning and Tientsin-Pukou Railways. When passing through Jinan, Chairman Han Fuju of Shandong invited Chang to inspect the Jiaoji Railway, so Chang decided to go to Qingdao. After finishing the inspection in Qingdao, if time permits, he will visit the Longhai and Peiping-Hankou Railways, or he will transfer to Hankou from Xuzhou. The time is tentatively set for two weeks. If there is not enough time, the Longhai and Peiping-Hankou Railways will be left for future inspection. Chang has just taken office and is not very familiar with the situation of the various railways, so he decided to go to the various railways to conduct on-site inspections. The Railway Department's work plan for this year is to quickly complete the Yuehan and Rongyu Railways within the shortest possible time. However, there are many mountains on the Rongyu Line, and it is quite difficult to build railways. The government had this plan in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. At that time, it was surveyed once, but this matter has not been realized. Now, all aspects of the situation have changed. If you want to build a railway, you still need to re-survey. After the survey is completed, construction can begin." (3rd)</p>

<p>Peiping News - At about 4:00 pm on the 1st of this month, the daughter of the deposed Qing "Prince Su" (commonly known as the twenty-first master), along with Wu Zhemin and someone of unknown nationality, a total of eight people, went to Yang Zhichuan's house at No. 23 Qianwachang Street, Old Drum Tower Street, claiming to be there to take over the property and to discuss important matters with Yang Zhichuan in person. Yang's servant said that the master had left Peiping for Tianjin due to some matter and that no one was responsible for handling matters in the house. They went to the Fifth District Office to visit the Director, Wu Kaicheng, to report the situation that had occurred, saying that the house where Yang Zhichuan currently lives, the Qianwachang house, is the property of Prince Su, and that she, the daughter of Prince Su, should inherit this property. As for how the house came into Yang Zhichuan's hands, she did not know, because she had gone to Japan in her childhood and has only now returned. She also said that she had formal evidence for the house at No. 23 Qianwachang Street, which could prove that the property belongs to her. Wu Kaicheng then went to Yang's house with the clerk Huang Guiyin and them, but there was no official person in charge at Yang's house, and there was still no result. He then instructed four of the people who came with him to occupy the house. Yang's house was originally equipped with a telephone, and one person was also sent to guard it. Yang Zhichuan did not come out to negotiate that night. On the 2nd, two wooden signs were suddenly hung at the entrance of Yang's house, both with black characters on a white background, one reading "Nikko" and the other reading "Niyuu." In the afternoon of the same day, at around 2:00 pm, Yang Zhichuan specially appointed representatives Chen Zhuming and lawyer Chen Tianxi to go to Yang's house at No. 23 Qianwachang Street to negotiate with the daughter of Prince Su. There was still no result until after 4:00 pm. When Chen Zhuming and others resigned, the daughter of Prince Su insisted on keeping Chen and others to continue negotiations. Chen and others felt that the matter was of great importance and dared not be responsible for replying, and resolutely resigned. As of 12:00 pm, the four people sent by the daughter of Prince Su to guard the house were still in Yang's house. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Yuehan Railway: Engineering of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Section</h3>
<p>Track-laying South of Hengyang Extends to Chenzhou Border; Roadbed in Chenping, Chenzhou, Already Taking Shape</p>
<p>All projects of the Hengyang Communication and Yuehan Railway Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section were rushed day and night in the year of the twenty-fourth, and the work was very tense. Sixteen difficult mountain tunnels on the entire line have been completed one after another. At the provincial border between Hunan and Guangdong, there are five huge steel-concrete arch bridges. Due to the inconvenience of transporting materials, progress has been difficult. Later, with the intensified efforts of the engineers stationed in the section, day and night, all have now been built above the water surface, and it will take only about a month to complete. However, the three major bridge projects in the northern section, including the Lu, Mi, and Lei Rivers, except for the Mi River, which has been completed in the season, continuous rain has caused the Xiang River to rise from time to time, resulting in several bridge piers being built deeper in the riverbed being repeatedly suspended and often obstructed. The two bridges will be opened to traffic in the next month and a half, without waiting for all the steel beams to be erected, so that the rail connection of the entire line can be realized ahead of schedule. As for the track-laying work, the northern section has already arrived at Hengshan from Zhuzhou and is continuing to extend southward. It is estimated that it will be laid to Hengyang in about two months. South of Hengyang, it is already possible to reach Loufengdu in the county of Chenzhou. It will soon reach Chenzhou Station. The remaining 60-kilometer section of solid rock roadbed in the Hepu line from Chenzhou to Pingshi in Guangdong has taken shape, and the mountain tunnels have also been completed. From now on, it will not be affected by weather or human affairs, so the connection between the north and south ends should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Commercial Crisis</h3>
<p>The Scope of Loans from the Three Banks is Still Small; Recovery of Southeast Business is Feared to be Difficult; A First-Class Silk Store Suddenly Declares Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The business community in this city previously requested the establishment of a commercial public treasury and the issuance of circulating notes due to tight money during the year-end settlement period. The Ministry of Finance rejected the request because it conflicted with the decree prohibiting the issuance of private currency and ordered the Fuzhou Central, China, and Transportation Banks to allocate one million yuan to rescue the financial market. After Provincial Chairman Chen Yi returned to Fujian, he specifically summoned the heads of the Central, China, and Transportation Banks to the government to discuss rescue measures and decided that the provincial government, county chamber of commerce, and the three banks would each elect three people to form a financial maintenance committee to handle loan matters. Any merchant in need of funds can submit real estate and request the committee to assess the price and borrow funds from the bank. However, although the nominal value is 100% of the property value, only 50% can be borrowed. In reality, real estate can only be assessed at 80% of the lowest market price, and the maximum loan amount can only be pledged at about 40%. Therefore, if they rely entirely on mortgaging property to borrow money for turnover, it will still not solve the problem, and it can only be used as a partial aid. Merchants are extremely eager for the committee to be established as soon as possible because they are in urgent need of funds. It is now reported that the provincial government intends to appoint Xu Fu, Chen Ticheng, and Lin Zhiyuan, the chamber of commerce intends to appoint Luo Mianhou, Chen Peikun, and Hong Fasui, and the bank will be represented by the heads of the three banks. However, after the committee is established, another evaluation committee must be formed to specialize in assessing house prices, so it will not be possible to start operating until after the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month at the earliest.</p>
<p>After the Southeast Bank suspended business, the provincial government organized a reorganization committee to liquidate creditors and debtors. The original plan was to resume business or reorganize, but more than a month has passed, but only more than 300,000 yuan of debts owed by people have been recovered, and most of the debts owed were embezzled by the bank's directors, managers, and important staff to operate other private businesses, which cannot be recovered. Calculating the currently received funds and the funds transferred from real estate mortgages, it is only enough to pay 50% of the amount of the issued banknotes. As for the original plan to resume business or reorganize, it is feared that it will be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>The situation in the commercial market is becoming more and more difficult as the settlement period approaches. Among them, the silk and cloth gangs of Jiangsu and Guangdong are the most exhausted. Because the shops of these two gangs, due to the depression of the market, purchased large quantities of goods on credit between summer and autumn and held large-scale sales to maintain their appearance. Now that the end of the year has arrived, they have no money to pay their debts and are all on the verge of collapse. Yesterday, Fan Yonghua Fine Cloth Store in Taijiang declared bankruptcy first, owing more than 20,000 yuan. It is found that Taijiang Fan is the concentrated area of silk and cloth stores in Jiangsu and Guangdong in this city. It is extremely prosperous on the surface on weekdays, but extremely empty inside. Yonghua is a first-class store in the area, only owing 20,000 yuan, and it has declared bankruptcy. Then other companies will inevitably be affected by it. Therefore, in these 20 or so days, it is a time of major commercial crisis in Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Double Year-End Approaches; Jiangxi Obtains Loans from Three Banks</h3>
<p>All Counties and Towns Unanimously Request Relief; Small and Medium-Sized Merchants Request Permission to Mortgage Furniture</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi's economy this year is depleted, and the market is depressed, which is unprecedented. At this time of the new and old year-end, everything is felt to be more difficult and tense. Finance Commissioner Wu Riqian went to Beijing and Shanghai a few days ago to contact Finance Minister Kong for this reason, requesting that the Central, China, and Transportation Banks lend two million yuan to the Jiangxi Provincial Yumin Bank to handle loan procedures to curb bankruptcy. The general method is: the types of loans are divided into two parts: (A) Goods mortgage: the borrower shall mortgage the Yumin Bank according to the normal goods mortgage procedures, and then the Yumin Bank shall re-mortgage the three banks. This item of goods is limited to those that can be actually transferred and occupied. (B) If the goods cannot be transferred and occupied temporarily, the borrower shall submit real estate as a second guarantee and specify the type, quantity, and value of the goods, issue notes, and mortgage them to the Yumin Bank, and then the Yumin Bank shall re-discount them to the three banks. The former loan, A accounts for 70%, and B accounts for 30%. Yumin's re-mortgage and re-discount to the three banks must be approved by the three banks first. The loan period is limited to four months. If the loan cannot be repaid on schedule, the provincial government is requested to give special flexible regulations for the borrower and guarantor and allow administrative sanctions. As for the loan review committee, it has been established and started lending on the 24th. However, after the news that the Finance Department borrowed two million yuan spread, all 83 county and town chambers of commerce petitioned to universally lend money for relief. The Finance Department rejected the petitions, saying that it could only provide relief to the market and had no power to universalize it. It is reported that the porcelain industry in Jingdezhen will be allocated another 200,000 yuan by the provincial government and the National Economic Commission to provide relief to this world-famous special product. However, in this city, only those with property can get loans, and small and medium-sized merchants cannot avoid being excluded. Therefore, rescue associations were organized by various industries to request loans with shop bottoms, docks, and furniture, and repeatedly petitioned Commissioner Wu. Wu said that the three banks could not agree to this type of mortgage. The commercial rescue association believed that small and medium-sized merchants would have no way to go. Furthermore, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank absorbed two or three million yuan of small deposits from the lower classes in Jiangxi, which should be released in Jiangxi and should not be transferred to Shanghai. It also petitioned the Finance Department to forward it to the Shanghai Bank to handle loans for small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises. Therefore, Cheng Shunyuan, the manager of the Jiangxi branch of the bank, has gone to Shanghai to ask the head office for instructions.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Prevent Rent Riots by Farmers in Various Townships</p>
<p>Due to the drought this year, the rice fields in various townships of Wu County have had a poor autumn harvest, so the rental collection of various field and estate owners is short. Since the opening of the granary, the number of collections has been less than 40%. Therefore, the Wu County government is strictly urging tenants to pay rent, while farmers in townships such as Weiting, Xie, Shentang, and Dianqiao have successively had major disputes after failing to achieve their goals of demanding rent reductions, and even destroyed the district office, sub-security station, town office, and the residences of collectors. After the security team sent teams to the townships to suppress them, the unrest calmed down, and five tenants, including Wang Changyi, who were the leaders in the trouble and resistance, were escorted to the county government on the 5th to be detained for punishment. The owners of each store, led by Pan Shengnian, also submitted a petition to the provincial government, requesting strict suppression of rebellious tenants in order to respect rental affairs. The security team headquarters dispatched teams to various townships on the 5th to patrol and prevent rent riots at any time. The Wu County magistrate will go to the province to ask for instructions on how to deal with it in the next few days.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Strange Knife Injury Case at Dasong Tomb</p>
<p>At 6:00 a.m. on the 5th, a vegetable seller in the thirteenth ward of the county, Dasong Tomb outside the South Gate, glimpsed a man with knife wounds in the tomb who died. Later, the ward chief Ye Xingquan reported it to the local court. Prosecutor Shen took the Wang coroner and others to examine the body. It was found that the man was about 30 years old, wearing a short black cloth jacket, looking like a coolie. There were two knife wounds on his throat, about four inches and two points wide. There were two knife wounds on the back of his neck, and the trachea and esophagus had been severed. It was confirmed that he died of knife wounds before his death. It was also found that the man had the words "Lin Jinsheng" and an anchor tattooed on his left hand. After the examination was completed, because there were no family members, the ward chief prepared a coffin to collect the body and waited for the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Criminal Investigation Team Arrests Extortionist</p>
<p>Zhang Tongyuan in Houyu Town, Wu Yi Second District, is quite wealthy and owns more than 1,000 mu of fertile land. On the first day of the twelfth lunar month, he suddenly received a letter of intimidation demanding 500 yuan and placing it next to the urinal for collection. After receiving the letter, Zhang made a paper package and placed it next to the urinal. Someone went to pick it up, but Zhang Tongshu still kept the secret and did not report it for investigation. The matter was learned by Zhang Baoliang, the mayor of the town, who reported it to County Magistrate Hou. The county magistrate sent two investigators, Mei Xiaomo and others, to investigate. Mei and others went to the countryside and remained silent for four days and nights before finally capturing the criminal Wu Zixiang. He was ordered to write a pair of letters, and the handwriting was similar to the letter of intimidation. The criminal was escorted to the city and interrogated in the county yesterday. The criminal confessed that he was 19 years old, from Tongzhou, and was a surveyor in the clearing team. This letter of intimidation was purely a game. The county government ordered him to be detained for verification.</p>
<p>Changshu: Water Police Officer Commits Suicide Due to Illness and Despair</p>
<p>Wang Yunsheng, a soldier of the Second Detachment of the Fourth Water Police Team stationed in Hupu, had enlisted for many years. He was usually healthy, but unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered from lung disease in the past two months, coughing non-stop and unable to sleep at night. Because he was trapped in economic difficulties, he could not afford medical treatment and had a motive for despair. Fortunately, he was persuaded by his friends and did not succeed. Unexpectedly, his illness became more and more severe recently. On the night before, taking advantage of the unpreparedness of others, he loaded a Mauser rifle with live ammunition, tied a thin rope to the trigger, and moved his foot to pull it. With a bang, the bullet entered his heart and exited from his back. When his colleagues heard the sound and got up to look, they saw Wang Yunsheng lying in a pool of blood and unable to be saved. The county was notified immediately, and an official was sent to the countryside on the 4th to examine the body. Wang was 29 years old and from Cixi, Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Jiuxing Bridge Collapses for Dozens of Feet</p>
<p>The Jiuxing Bridge (Jiangbei) pier of the Puji Ferry collapsed at about 3:00 a.m. on the 4th, with a length of more than ten feet and a width of six or seven feet collapsing on the river bank. Residents were all in a dream, only hearing a strange sound. They only realized it at dawn. Fortunately, no one was injured. The ferries that opened from Siyuan Canal that morning all went straight to Zhenjiang and returned to Guazhou to disembark passengers. The Jiangbei passengers under Jiuxing Bridge disembarked at Guazhou and changed to short shifts to Yangzhou.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Mastermind of Robbery and Kidnapping Escorted to Hangzhou</p>
<p>Huang Xikun, a Chinese bank clerk in Hangzhou, was escorting remittances to No. 46 Shangcangqiao Zhijie on April 27th of this year when he was murdered by bandits and robbed of more than 6,000 yuan in cash. The case occurred eight months ago. After a thorough investigation by the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, a clue was obtained. On December 18th, Jiang Mingxia was captured at the Meichi station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He confessed that he had committed the robbery together with Xie Qifeng, Lu Xingxuan, and others. Later, detectives were sent to Changxing to capture Lu Xingxuan. He also confessed that he and Xie committed the crime of kidnapping the four-year-old young son of Sun Xiyun, the owner of the Jianggan Qianzhi Sugar Store, demanding a ransom of seven years, tearing up the ticket, and shooting the driver when raising the ticket. Moreover, Xie was the mastermind in both cases. Xie fled to Shaanxi immediately after the incident. The Xi'an Public Security Bureau was notified by telegram to arrest him in the Shandong apartment and send someone to escort him. He arrived in Hangzhou last night and was sent to the Public Security Bureau. Xie tried to commit suicide repeatedly on the way, so he was taken care of properly. The bandits were all college students. Jiang was a student at the Shanghai Business and Political College, Xie was a student at the Southeast Medical College, and Xie was a student at the Tongji Medical College. The three were all close relatives. Lu's father had served as the magistrate of Haining County and the director of the Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Tongyixing Rice Store Robbed</p>
<p>Tongyixing Rice Store, outside the West Gate of Zhapu, has been open for many years and has a lot of savings. At midnight at the end of last month, seven bandits suddenly broke in through the back door with box guns and sharp blades, scaring the store owner Jiang Wenbin and his son into silence. They robbed a lot of cash, jewelry, clothes, and bedding. The bandits were still not satisfied. They took off the shoes and socks of Xiao Dongjiang Zirong and burned his toes with Western candle fire. Zirong shouted in pain, and the bandits, fearing it would be unfavorable, fired two shots and left. The store had been robbed not long ago. Having suffered two losses, they were unwilling to accept it. They opened a loss list and submitted it to the Second Public Security Bureau, begging for investigation.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: Meat Shops in the Urban Area Go on Strike</p>
<p>Due to the county government's increase of two cents of education surcharge per pig, all the fresh meat shop operators in the urban area opposed it. While they were holding a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on the 31st, the county government sent police to summon the operators to the county. Since it could not be resolved, the two directors, Chen and Fu, were detained, causing all 15 meat shops in the urban area to go on strike from New Year's Day. As of noon on the 3rd, the county government had not released the directors, so the fresh meat shops in the urban area had not opened. On the afternoon of the 3rd, all the meat shop operators, in addition to sending telegrams to the provincial government's finance and education departments, also petitioned the Party Headquarters, saying that the county magistrate abused his power, detained the directors, and forced the closure of the market, and asked for relief.</p>
<p>Education Broadcasting Special Issue</p>
<h3>National Language Course Lecture: How to Write (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ye Shaojun, Editor of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>In the past, people who learned to write articles paid attention to reciting scriptures, often saying that as long as they read dozens of articles thoroughly, they would naturally be able to write. This sounds mysterious, but the principle is very common. It turns out that it means cultivating language habits. Literary Chinese is different from spoken language. Not only are the words used different, but also a part of the sentence structure is very different. To learn to write literary Chinese that is different from spoken language, there is no other way than to learn this special language habit, and recitation is a cultivation to learn this special language habit. Therefore, putting aside other aspects and only talking about the method of learning to write articles from recitation in the past, that is correct. If you want to learn to write literary Chinese now, I think you should also start with reciting literary Chinese. However, I don't think you really need to write literary Chinese. Saying that the vernacular is shallow and the literary Chinese is deep, and that learning the vernacular first and then the literary Chinese is a gradual process from shallow to deep, this statement is really unreasonable. The shallowness and depth of an article should be determined by the content and technology, not by whether the style is vernacular or literary Chinese. If the content is good and the expression technology is also good, even if it is the vernacular, it is also deep. If the content is bad and the expression technology is also bad, even if it is the literary Chinese, it is also shallow. Moreover, since we are modern people, to express our thoughts and feelings, we naturally use modern language in speech, and naturally use the vernacular written according to the spoken language in writing. Being able to write the vernacular, we already have the most convenient tool, so why should we go to learn a kind of impractical literary Chinese? If it is said that in college entrance examinations or other examinations, there is often a bracket added under the Chinese language topic, and the four words "limited to literary Chinese" are written in the bracket, so you have to prepare in advance. This is really because the people in charge of the examination are too ignorant. We hope that they will gradually become enlightened and no longer do this kind of deliberately making things difficult for people without any practical significance in the near future. But before this fact has completely disappeared, you have to spare some time to learn to write literary Chinese for the sake of entering school and passing other examinations.</p>
<p>The above said a lot of words, nothing more than to explain that the most important thing to write fluent articles is to cultivate our language habits. Because we believe that articles are records of language, and the two are originally the same thing, but we have to go further. When we write articles, we cannot fail to know the differences between articles and language. As mentioned earlier, when speaking, there are facial expressions and body postures as help, but articles do not have this help, which is the difference. Knowing that there is this layer, we have to pay special attention when writing articles, how to write appropriately, so that we can make people understand without relying on this help. Are there only this layer of differences? Below, we will say some more. For example, when two people chat, they often talk from the south to the north, and the ending can be completely unrelated to the beginning. Even when discussing a problem or discussing a matter, sometimes a digression is added in the middle, like vines crawling away, crawling completely away from the topic, until one person realizes it and says, "Let's talk about serious business," then it is cut off with a knife and returns to the topic again. Articles cannot be like this. Most articles are prepared for people to read, and a small part is left for themselves to check in the future. Every article has a center. Without a center, there is no need to write, so when writing, only words related to the center should be written in, and they should be arranged very properly so that the center is completely revealed. As for those unconstrained random words, like vines crawling away, should be eliminated completely, so that they do not waste our writing. For example, when narrating a thing in language, it is often verbose and does not omit small things. If you convey a conversation, you have to narrate it as it is, one is one, two is two, what A said, what B said, what A said again, what B said again. Articles cannot be like this. Articles strive for convenience for both writing and reading, so they should pay attention to economy. If you leave out all the important words, an article does not reveal any center, which is not economical. You must write all the important things in. In addition, there is no verbose word. It is just like being good at using money. You should never save money where you should not save money, and you should never spend a penny where you should not spend money. This is enough to be called economy. Under this condition, narrating a thing has to pay attention to the method of detail and brevity. The narrative of the process of the thing is not of the same amount. You must teach people to understand the detailed parts and do not hesitate to spend a lot of writing. The parts that do not need to be taught to people in detail can be passed over in one stroke. If you record people's conversations, you have to pay attention to the effort of selection. You do not make a complete record of people's language. Only those that can show their thoughts, insights, temperament, etc. are allowed to be selected, otherwise, it is okay to leave them out. For example, when we speak, we often use local dialects and the special tones of the local language. Articles are not like this. Articles have to look at the reader's origin. If an article is prepared for people from all over the world to read, it should use the vocabulary and tones that are common in various places. The vocabulary and tones that are only common in the local area must be completely eliminated, so that the disadvantages of barriers can be avoided. The above are all the differences between articles and language. Knowing these layers also knows the outline of writing technology. Knowledge gradually becomes a habit, so writing has the convenience of recording language without the disadvantage of rigidly recording language.</p>
<p>Now come to an end. How to write? The most important thing is to cultivate our language habits. If the language habits are good, the articles written will be fluent. Secondly, it is important to distinguish the differences between articles and language. If you understand the distinction, you can know and do, and the articles you write will not only be fluent, but also complete and beyond reproach. (End)</p>

<h3>County Public Security Bureau - Respectfully Informing Newly Reformed Opium Smokers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, starting from February 1st of this year, has designated this as the period for the overall inspection against opium smoking. To ensure opium smokers understand the significance of this, they have specifically issued a respectful announcement to newly reformed opium smokers, hoping they will awaken as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Now, we present the original text below, so everyone should know: Our China is now in the most critical and difficult period. The biggest cause of this situation is the scourge of opium. Therefore, the government has made a resolute decision to ban opium and will absolutely no longer be lenient. The formulated anti-opium laws are very strict and impactful. Opium smokers who privately smoke without a license or relapse after quitting will face severe penalties, possibly even the death penalty. Originally, a person who smokes opium will harm their health, shorten their lifespan, and lose their wealth, becoming more ghost than human. Good relatives and friends will look down on them, and close parents and spouses will ignore them. Even if the government did not ban it, what pleasure is there in smoking opium? Moreover, under such a tightly woven net of laws, why bother to bring trouble upon oneself? Since this province effectively implemented the opium ban last year, opium cessation licenses have now been issued for the third term. Many determined opium smokers have completely quit, escaped the suffering of being blacklisted, and returned to being honest citizens. This is indeed a good phenomenon. However, there are still many opium smokers who, for various reasons during the general registration, did not register with the government to obtain a license to quit opium. The government is also well aware of this. Now, out of consideration for these unfortunate unregistered opium smokers, it is stipulated that from January 1st to the end of the month of the 25th year of the Republic, there will be a registration period for newly reformed opium smokers. During this period, being able to resolve to quit is the best opportunity. If, due to illness or old age, one cannot quit temporarily, paying the third-term license fee to the government will exempt one from the penalty for unlicensed private smoking. If one insists on remaining unenlightened, once the deadline expires, the overall inspection will be implemented starting from February 1st. Our public security organs, in order to fulfill the responsibility of strictly enforcing the law, will honestly and without being polite, implement arrests and will absolutely not be lenient. We hope that opium smokers who have not obtained a license to quit smoking will pay attention quickly and take advantage of this opportunity for newly reformed registration to turn back to the right path!</p>

<h3>Shanghai County - Yesterday's Rice Stem Borer Eradication Meeting - Resolved to Guide Farmers to Dig Up and Burn Rice Roots</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Rice Stem Borer Eradication Committee held its second meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday in the county government conference room. Committee members Zhang Yi, Fu Dianying, Zhang Jingye, Huang Meixian, Jin Zuobin, Ding Hongzhang, Xu Yuyin, Ye Zhendong, etc. were present. The meeting was chaired by Ye Zhendong and recorded by Li Tongrui. After the meeting began as scheduled, the chairman first reported that the Construction Bureau had instructed that the county should still guide farmers to collect and burn rice roots exposed above the soil. The case was handled accordingly and continued to discuss how to handle it. It was resolved that the county government should order the Public Security Bureau and various district offices to, together with the people's education halls, beat gongs to advise farmers to dig up and burn all rice roots exposed above the soil within half a month of receiving the notice.

<h3>Japan and Germany Order Chinese Cotton - National Cotton Exports Increase Sharply - Japanese Merchants Purchase 160,000 Dan in Nantong, German Merchants Purchase 5,000 Dan, Still in Initial Stages</h3>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that after the National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Association actively improved cotton production in various parts of China, the quality has been improving day by day. The cotton produced in the two major cotton-producing areas, such as Nantong in Jiangsu and Shaanxi, is of excellent quality and is very popular among foreign merchants. Since October of last year, cotton exports have been huge, with the largest amount being exported to Japan. In three months, Japanese merchants have ordered 160,000 dan of Chinese cotton, a rare surge in recent years. According to sources in the cotton industry, Germany has also recently ordered 5,000 dan of cotton from Nantong, China. In the past, Germany purchased all the cotton it needed from the United States. Purchasing from China is still in its initial stages. This year, due to curbing the large-scale import of American cotton and the impact of the Italian-Abyssinian War, Indian cotton exports to Germany have sharply decreased, so it has had to purchase from China. In the future, it is expected that exports of domestic cotton to Germany will continue to increase.</p>
<h3>New US Consul General in Shanghai - Mr. Gauss Arriving Next Month</h3>

<h3>Issuance Reserve Management Committee - Inspecting the Legal Tender Reserves of the Three Banks - Reporting to the Ministry of Finance for Record and Announcing Monthly</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the Ministry of Finance stipulated on November 4th of last year that the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be legal tender, it also established an Issuance Reserve Management Committee to inspect the issuance amounts and reserves of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Kenye Bank, Siming Bank, and Commercial, Agricultural, and Industrial Banks. The inspection rules have now been promulgated by the Ministry, and the Issuance Reserve Management Committee has followed the rules to ensure that the issuance of legal tender is fully backed by reserves in accordance with the issuance amount. Cash reserves account for 60%, consisting of gold, silver, or foreign exchange. Security reserves account for 40%, consisting of valuable securities issued or guaranteed by the National Government and other assets or short-term commercial paper deemed reliable by the Ministry of Finance. Committee members such as Ye Zhuotang are dispatched monthly to inspect the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications once to demonstrate trustworthiness. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance, it is also announced publicly.

<h3>Machine Factory Joint Association Notifies Factories - Automatic Inspection of Fire Hazards</h3>
<p>Printed Automatic Inspection Method for Factory Safety Equipment</p>
<p>Distributed to Each Factory for Preparation to Eliminate Disasters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Joint Association believes that the occurrence of fire hazards has a significant impact on life and property. Moreover, factories have vast areas, strong capital, and many workers. The concern for life and property is more than dozens or hundreds of times greater. Therefore, to eliminate disasters, continuous inspection is essential. Therefore, it has specifically printed the Automatic Inspection Method for Factory Safety Equipment and notified each factory for reference and implementation. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Notice to Each Factory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Joint Association notifies each factory: Greetings. In the past, Confucius saw a golden statue in the Zhou Temple with its mouth sealed three times and inscribed on its back: "The ancient person who was careful with words." The saying goes, "One word can build a nation, and one word can destroy a nation." It can be seen that disaster comes from the mouth, and its impact is so great. For example, if a fire occurs now, life and property will be reduced to ashes. Those who have fire insurance can, after cleaning up the ashes, rely on the insurance company's compensation to reorganize. However, if the cause of the fire, after investigation, is proven to contradict the clauses attached to the issued policy, the insurance company may refuse its responsibility, pay only a part, or even not pay at all. Then, the factory that has the fire suffers greatly. Therefore, employees should not talk nonsense or speculate about the cause of the fire and should know to be cautious. It should also be known that the occurrence of unfortunate events is not limited to fire. Any event should imitate the golden statue's three seals on its mouth. Now, because the attached Automatic Inspection Method for Factory Safety Equipment is included, it is specially sent to you. We hope you pay attention to it. Sincerely, we wish you public peace.</p>
<p>Automatic Inspection</p>
<p>Automatic Inspection Method for Factory Safety Equipment</p>
<p>In factories, it is often necessary to accumulate fuel and store raw materials, which often causes fire. The most likely sources of fire in factories are:</p>
<p>Boilers, fuel rooms, steam pipes, machine friction</p>
<p>Air engines, generators, electrical transformers, electricity</p>
<p>Gas pipes, gas stoves, etc.</p>
<p>Kerosene, gasoline</p>
<p>Candles, lighters, and chemical drugs</p>
<p>Coal piles</p>
<p>Alcohol, wood, paper, etc.</p>
<p>Marsh gas in ditches, naturally ignited objects. Because there are flammable items, and even naturally flammable items, the spread of the fire can quickly turn into a prairie fire. If there are raw materials to help it burn, once a fire starts, it is beyond remedy. If each factory does not have sufficient fire prevention equipment and training on a daily basis, it is inevitable that a tragedy will occur, and even lives will be affected. The intensity of the harm is unimaginable. We hope that those who are in factories do not take it lightly. The effective methods of defense are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Architectural Equipment and Inspection</p>
<p>Factories are best built with steel-reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>Material and fuel storage areas should be built with cavity walls or fire-resistant bricks.</p>
<p>If wood is used in places with a slight possibility of ignition, the wood should be treated with a chemical solution to make it difficult to ignite. Fire-resistant solutions can be purchased from the Pingan Industrial Factory.</p>
<p>Important offices should not be close to boiler rooms or fuel rooms.</p>
<p>Factories should adopt low-rise buildings and should not be too high.</p>
<p>The roof should not be made of flammable materials.</p>
<p>Install more emergency exits and fire escape ladders (are there piles of objects at the entrance and ladder side?)</p>
<p>Install fire hydrants (B) Non-Architectural Equipment and Inspection</p>
<p>Automatic fire extinguishing devices (installed?)</p>
<p>Fire alarm (installed?)</p>
<p>Fire extinguishers (purchased?)</p>
<p>Fire buckets and sand buckets (installed?)</p>
<p>Ladders, iron hooks, etc. (installed?)</p>
<p>Other rescue equipment</p>
<p>(C) Management Equipment and Inspection</p>
<p>Organize a fire brigade. The number of team members depends on the size of the factory. Set up a fire chief to lead them. If the fire brigade is large, several team leaders can be established, led by the general captain. (For factory fire drills, please refer to my book "Fire Prevention Method" (General Sales by Life Bookstore)</p>
<p>Training of fire brigade members</p>
<p>Training of general workers</p>
<p>Establish close contact with the police authorities</p>
<p>Workers are not allowed to smoke while working, and when smoking during breaks, they must do so in the smoking room or in an open area. (Strictly punish those who throw cigarette butts and sparks)</p>
<p>The general captain should always observe the workers' laziness and caution. Those who contribute to the fire brigade should be rewarded, and those who are negligent should be punished.</p>
<p>A separate annual fire prevention expense should be set up in the accounting book.</p>
<p>The above are just general situations. Factories can choose to adopt them according to their different environments. We hope that industrialists can pay attention to this, and unfortunate events can be reduced, and the investment of capitalists and the lives of workers can be further protected.</p>
<h3>General Employees and Passengers - Prohibited from Embarking and Disembarking at Wusong Port</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs Imposes Prohibition - Shipping Industry Unanimously Opposes</p>
<p>Shanghai's pilotage is divided into two types: one is for ocean-going ships, which are guided to Shanghai from the Tongsha sea area. The pilotage rights have long been controlled by foreigners. Although Chinese have striven for it in recent years, and with the establishment of the Jiang Gong Association, most of the pilots for river vessels are Chinese. Since last year, after the Jianghai Customs acquired the pilotage rights for this route, the Yangtze River pilotage must also be controlled by the Customs. Chinese who hold this position must pass the Customs examination and be deemed qualified before being appointed. The power of selection rests with foreign advisors. The situation is inverted, which hinders national prestige. After the Customs acquired the Yangtze River pilotage rights, it notified each shipping company that the hiring of pilots for Chinese ships must be requested from the Customs, and they are not allowed to hire on their own as they did in the past. Also, fearing that each shipping company would resist or hire privately, the Customs authorities, in order to achieve the goal of unified assignment by the Customs, imposed a prohibition: all Chinese merchant ships passing through Wusong Port are prohibited from freely embarking and disembarking, regardless of whether they are passengers or crew members. Since the promulgation of this prohibition, passengers on river vessels directly traveling to and from the river are no longer allowed to disembark at Wusong. They can only go to Shanghai and then to Wusong, and the loss and pain are still minor. Those who take ships from other ports directly to the Yangtze River can, as usual, land. If crew members take the opportunity to return to Shanghai or passengers take the opportunity to visit Shanghai, now because of the Customs prohibition, all are prohibited from embarking and disembarking. In recent days, crew members and passengers on Chinese merchant ships have been unduly prohibited, and the number of those who cannot go to Shanghai is more than several hundred. This is not a national prohibition. Since its implementation, Wusong Port has been greatly affected, and Chinese merchant ships no longer dock. Only some foreign merchant ships remain. In recent days, the unexpected losses suffered by each Chinese merchant ship due to this semi-blockade have aroused the anger of all shipping companies. The crew members and passengers on each ship are even more heartbroken after being prohibited from embarking and disembarking at Wusong Port by the Customs. Now, they have jointly named and telegraphed the central government, expressing unanimous protest. The crew member organizations have also submitted reports to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications, demanding the revocation of this informal Customs prohibition that hinders land and sea transportation, and the anti-protest telegrams have all been sent.</p>

<h3>End of Student Domestic Products Year: Statistics on Educational Imports</h3>
<p>Total Value Exceeds 16 Million National Currency Units; Scientific Instruments Account for the Largest Share of Imports</p>
<p>The Student Domestic Products Year has come to an end. The import figures for educational supplies during the past year should be of concern to all sectors. A New News Agency reporter has made a special inquiry to the Statistics Office of the International Trade Bureau and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Total Import Value</p>
<p>Last year was the Student Domestic Products Year. During this year, the total import value of educational supplies was 7,194,000+ gold units, equivalent to 16,070,000+ national currency units. This is a slight decrease compared to the 7,753,426 gold units of the same period last year, but the decrease is minimal, only about 7%. This shows that the efforts of the academic community in promoting domestic products seem to be not yet thorough. It is hoped that all sectors of education will continue to work hard in the future.</p>
<p>Scientific Instruments</p>
<p>The largest import value of educational supplies is for scientific instruments, valued at 2,897,000+ gold units. Next are books and sheet music, valued at 2,766,000+ units. Followed by printing ink and ink, etc., valued at 858,000+ units. Sports and other games equipment are valued at 635,000+ gold units. Maps and drawings are also valued at 36,000+ gold units. Except for gasoline ink and drawings, the import values this year have decreased compared to the same period last year. The largest decrease is in books and sheet music, which decreased by about 16%. Although other commodities have declined, the decrease is very small.</p>
<p>Country of Origin</p>
<p>As for the source of imports and educational supplies, according to the survey by the Statistics Office of the International Trade Bureau, three-fifths of the imported scientific instruments are of German origin, followed by the United States. Japanese and British goods also have a considerable share. As for books and sheet music, more are imported from the United States than from Europe. Printing ink and ink mostly come from the United Kingdom. In addition, many are also shipped from Japan and Germany.</p>

<p>The directorate of the two railways, the Thailand Railway Ministry, instructed: "According to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau's report, the special rate for the four-way joint transport of coarse paper, which the railway has agreed on with Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Jinpu, was previously approved to be implemented on a trial basis for six months from July 1, 1935. From July 1 of this year to the end of November, a total of more than 2,190 tons were exported during the special rate period. Although the quantity is not large, it is sufficient to prove that the special rate method still has absorption capacity compared to the previous rare exports. It is also found that the export period of the coarse paper is in the Qingming and Winter Solstice seasons, and the Winter Solstice season is especially high. It is proposed to approve the extension of the handling period for one year to attract customers. In addition, there are now a considerable number of these coarse papers transported to Jiaoji, Beining, and Longhai roads and lines. In order to fully develop road transportation, the three roads have been consulted and agreed to join this special rate for the joint transportation of coarse paper. The freight of each road part, except for the Longhai Road, which is still calculated according to the ordinary freight rate, the freight of the Jiaoji and Beining roads is calculated in accordance with the Jinpu and Jinghu-Huhangyong road methods, regardless of whether the vehicle is full or not, uniformly reduced by 10% according to the price listed in the current freight rate table, in order to absorb, etc." According to this, it is found that the special rate method for the joint transportation of coarse paper is said to be excellent during the trial period and should be approved to continue to extend the period for one year from January 1, 1936, in order to attract customers. In addition, the special rate has been agreed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road to join Beining, Jiaoji, and Longhai Road, and it is approved to handle it accordingly. In addition to the separate order, it should be followed. This order has been transferred to the Transportation Department for compliance.</p>
<h3>Due to the Wu Case, Discussing the Xuchang Tobacco Company, the Xuchang Court Ruled that the Lawsuit Would Not Be Prosecuted</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Mr. Wu Tingsheng, the former chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association, was assassinated in Xuchang on the 30th of last month. All parties believe that there is a considerable relationship with the Xuchang Tobacco Company. A reporter met with the person in charge of the Cigarette Industry Association yesterday. According to the conversation, the outside world has been spreading that Mr. Wu's Xuchang Tobacco Company is an illegal organization, which is not true. Therefore, a copy of the non-prosecution decision issued by the Xuchang Local Court Inspection Office of Henan Province was produced to prove it. The original book is recorded as follows: Non-Prosecution Decision of the Xuchang Local Court Inspection Office of Henan Province. Defendant: Wu Tingsheng and other nine persons. Accuser: Jiang Zihe and other three persons. The right-listed defendants, etc., due to a case of financial fraud and embezzlement, was investigated and concluded by this office on No. 94 of the criminal investigation of the Republic of China, and it is considered that no prosecution should be initiated. The reasons in fact and law are as follows: Reasons in fact: Defendant Ren Boyan, in the early years of the Republic of China, purchased more than 90 mu of land from the Hu family and others outside the Xiguan of Xuchang in the name of Yongan Hall to build a factory to collect tobacco. He then leased it to the British-American Tobacco Company for a period of 30 years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that the contract was extremely harsh and violated Chinese sovereignty, and requested the Henan Provincial Government to instruct the Xuchang County Government to order Ren Boyan to amend the lease. Later, due to the outbreak of the war, the army was stationed for a long time and was not careful with fire, and all the houses were burned to the ground. The British-American Tobacco Company and Ren Boyan terminated the contract. However, the people of Xuchang still suspected that there were British and American foreign merchants as the background, and filed complaints with various central and local agencies for many years. After deliberation, the three departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Industry convened a meeting, believing that since it had broken away from the British and Americans, the diplomatic issue could be declared over. In March of this summer, Ren Boyan again entrusted Shen Kunshan as an agent to sell the land to Xuchang Tobacco Leaf Co., Ltd., and there were new and old land deeds. Xuchang Company also registered No. 347 in the Ministry of Industry. The head office is located in Shanghai, and the Xuchang office has also been instructed by the Henan Provincial Government to supplement the branch registration. The company had long been legally established without foreign capital. Although there are preparations for the Yu-Su Baked Tobacco Factory recently, the nuclear volume has not been realized, and Jiang Zihe, etc., happened to file complaints twice at this time. Legal reasons: After verifying the repeated statements and county records of the accused Jiang Zihe, etc., it is considered that no prosecution should be initiated. The procedural and substantive laws are explained separately: Procedures are illegal. The regulations of the Criminal Procedure Law are clear from the accusation and report, and even ordinary people can understand. Since the accusers are not the victims themselves, how can they directly sue the court? Moreover, those who have already sued cannot report again, and it is also clearly stipulated in the same law. The accusers' statements that they stole and sold the national land, etc., have been reviewed, and there are no provisions in the criminal law. Assuming that it is one of the foreign troubles, it should be reported directly to the High Court, and this office can hardly accept it, and it can be directly rejected. However, the substantive law is not investigated, and it is not enough to convince and finalize the conviction. The substantive law is not unanimous. After reviewing the original copy, the accused Wu Tingsheng presented a volume of the new and old land deeds of the Xuchang Tobacco Leaf Company, Xiguan, outside Xuzhou City, Henan Province, in court on December 10 of this year. The procedures were complete and there were no flaws. The accusers are all making empty attacks, and the statements have no concrete evidence. It is difficult to think that there is a fact of buying and selling land on behalf of foreigners, and it is even more difficult to determine that the defendants are guilty. As for the middlemen Wang Yintang and Yang Ziming, they denied in court that they had signed, but after reviewing a letter sent by the defendant Xu Liwu from Kaifeng on November 28 of this year, it stated that in early February of this summer, Wu Tingsheng hosted a dinner at the company in Canghutong. Shen Kunshan, Chen Bo, Wang Yintang, Zhu Youlian, Zhou Jintang, Yang Ziming, and the speaker, as well as two people in the company, were at the same table. Wu Tingsheng said at the table that the land had been sold to Xuchang Company by Shen Kunshan on behalf of the company. All the gentlemen are here to witness, etc., which proves that the defendants Wang Yintang and Yang Ziming were also present and cannot deny it. After comparing the handwriting of Yang Ziming's letter to Wu Tingsheng and Wu Shenpeng with the six characters of Wang Yintang and Yang Ziming signed on the original contract, there is no difference, and the testimony of the defendant Yang Ziming is obviously flawed and difficult to believe. Furthermore, the witnesses are one of the essential elements of a private contract, and they are also to witness the dispute between the two parties. If both parties acknowledge it, it does not have any relationship with the third party, and it is unreasonable for the accusers to use this as an attack target. Based on the above conclusion, the conduct of the accused Wu Tingsheng, etc., does not constitute a crime, and no prosecution should be initiated in accordance with Article 231, Section 8 of the Criminal Law. A special disposition is made as follows: Prosecutor Jing Huimin, Clerk Li Xiaozeng.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association Urges Members to Pay Tobacco and Alcohol License Fees and Encourages Them to Comply with Agreed-Upon Price Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association's South Shanghai Office specially issued notices to its members yesterday to urge them to pay the tobacco and alcohol license fees and to encourage them to comply with the agreed-upon price regulations. The notice regarding urging payment of fees stated, "Inquiry: The winter season for tobacco and alcohol license tax is coming to an end, and the spring season is about to begin. According to the regulations, it must be collected from January 1 to 10. If the deadline is exceeded, a fine will be imposed. There are not many days left before the deadline for renewal. It is hereby notified to all that the tobacco shops should send the old license along with the tax to this office (No. 427 Fumin Road, Dananmenkou) before January 10 (i.e., December 16 of the lunar calendar) as usual for compilation and agency collection, and then forward and collect. Please do not exceed the deadline to avoid losses. Be sure to inform each other." The notice regarding price compliance stated, "Inquiry: Approved by the General Assembly on the 26th of this month, we invited leaders of the industry from all over the country and convened an office meeting yesterday. It was unanimously agreed that with the recent currency system reform, the exchange rates of goods have been stabilized. All of us in the industry should abide by the law and never compete with each other again. The suspended price is disordered and hinders the industry regulations. The temporary price of the door sale is agreed upon jointly, and the list is as follows. It is hereby issued and notified, hoping that it will be posted on the front of each number and sold accordingly to show uniformity. If there is a breach, or if there is a violation, once it is found and reported, it will be immediately submitted to the competent authority for sanctions and penalties. The whole body passed the proposal and issued this urgent notice, hoping everyone knows and does not ignore it, which may lead to sanctions and penalties. Be sure to inform each other."</p>

<h3>Shareholders of Yichang and Yikang Money Shops, etc., Yan Ruling Petitions for Reconciliation, The Court Specially Convened a Meeting of Creditors to Decide on the Creditor Program</h3>
<p>After the collapse of Yichang and Yikang Money Shops and Yifengchang Silk Shop in this city last year, Yan Ruling, the shareholder of the shops, filed a petition with the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to apply for reconciliation. The court accepted the case and appointed accountant Li Ding and lawyer Zhang Shirang as supervisors and assistants. At 3 pm the day before yesterday, a meeting of creditors was convened at the office of accountant Li at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Attending: Yu Lüde, a judge of the First Special Court, attended; supervisors and assistants Li Ding and Zhang Shirang attended; debtor Yan Ruling attended; and creditors Wu Zitai of the Youth Company, representing a debt of 28,000 yuan, Yan Xiyu of the Continental Bank, representing a debt of 20,000 yuan, and Zhou Bingrong, the liquidator of Yifengchang, representing a debt of 462,637.45 yuan, and Xu Boxiong, representing the creditor of Yichang Zhuang, representing a debt of 600,716.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: Judge Yu, Li Ding, and Zhang Shirang served as the presidium. Judge Yu first reported the purpose of convening the creditors' meeting, followed by accountant Li Ding reporting the number of debt declarations and registrations, and the number of creditors attending today and the amount of debt represented. Finally, the declaration of the reconciliation plan applied for by debtor Yan Ruling was read out. The creditors attending believed that there was still a need to study the reconciliation plan, so Judge Yu announced that the creditors should first study the plan, and then the court would convene a meeting of creditors to vote for or against the decision.</p>
<p>Reconciliation Plan: The reconciliation plan proposed by debtor Yan Ruling is recorded as follows: Inquiry: The estimated cash assets of Yan Ruling are about 962,695.8 yuan, and the estimated recoverable amount is only 346,695.8 yuan. When the actual price is realized, there will be differences between the estimated recoverable amount and the estimated amount. As for the current liabilities, the total is 1,700,719.95 yuan, of which 596,000 yuan of secured priority debts can be disposed of the collateral to obtain compensation, and the unsecured ordinary debts are 1,091,194.93 yuan. The estimated recoverable amount of 346,695.8 yuan is not enough to offset the shortfall of 744,499.13 yuan. The shortfall is so large that Yan Ruling has no other assets to clear the debt, and he has no choice but to distribute the estimated recoverable amount of 346,695.8 yuan of assets on average to the unsecured ordinary debts of 1,091,194.93 yuan, and each debt of 100 yuan can be assigned 31.77 yuan. If the recoverable amount of the estimated price is more, the number of percentages distributed on average can be slightly increased. If the price is less, the number of percentages assigned can only be slightly reduced. There is no alternative, and there is no good plan. Therefore, the method of averaging the price of assets is used as a reconciliation plan. I beg your court to review and approve it and send it to the creditors for the creditors' meeting to decide whether to approve it or not. Petitioner: Yan Ruling, Accountant: Xu Yongzuo.</p>

<h3>Shooting Battle During Robbery Arrest at the Intersection of Rue Baille: One Robber Wounded and Captured</h3>
<p>At around 0:45 AM this morning, a pedestrian was passing behind the cow slaughtering company at the South Zhujiaqiao in the French Concession when four thugs suddenly emerged from the darkness, brandishing pistols, and blocked his path. They threatened him with their guns and stripped off his fur coat, then fled. The pedestrian, unwilling to accept this, tracked them. Two of the robbers, one wearing a Western-style short overcoat and the other in blue cloth shirt and pants, fled towards Avenue Piquet, entering the intersection of Rue Baille. The victim shouted "Robbers!" from behind. A patrol officer in the area heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and the patrol officer also drew his gun and returned fire. More than ten shots were fired, like a string of pearls. As a result, one of the robbers in blue cloth shirt and pants was shot in the lower body and collapsed. He was arrested by the patrol officer and taken to the Songshan Road Police Station together with the victim for further investigation. The remaining robbers managed to escape without a trace.</p>

<p>Ordinary Trains: (1) Ordinary trains, via the old ferry. (A) One-way ticket, for example, Shanghai to Beiping. The ordinary ticket price from Shanghai to Nanjing should be added to the ordinary ticket price from the capital to Tianjin, and then the ordinary ticket price from Tianjin to Beiping. For example, if it is first class, it is 9 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, plus 45 yuan, 6 jiao, plus 6 yuan, 3 jiao, totaling 61 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen. (B) Round-trip sightseeing ticket, for example, Shanghai to Beiping round-trip. The ordinary round-trip ticket price between Shanghai and Nanjing should be added to the ordinary round-trip ticket price between the capital and Tianjin, and then the ordinary round-trip ticket price between Tianjin and Beiping. For example, if it is first class, it is 14 yuan, 2 jiao between Shanghai and Nanjing, plus 68 yuan, 4 jiao between the capital and Tianjin, plus 9 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen between Tianjin and Beiping, totaling 92 yuan, 0 jiao, 5 fen.</p>
<p>Special Express Trains: (2) Special express trains, via railway ferry. (A) One-way ticket, for example, Shanghai to Beiping first class. The ticket price should be calculated according to item (1) A, which is 61 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen, plus the difference between the old and new ferries of 4 jiao, 5 fen, plus the first-class special express train surcharge of 9 yuan for the through mileage of 1462 kilometers between Shanghai and Beiping, totaling 70 yuan, 8 jiao. (B) Round-trip sightseeing ticket, for example, Shanghai to Beiping round-trip first class. The round-trip ticket price from Shanghai to Nanjing of 14 yuan, 2 jiao should be added to the round-trip ticket price from Nanjing to Tianjin of 14 yuan, 2 jiao, the round-trip ticket price from Nanjing to Tianjin of 68 yuan, 2 jiao, the round-trip ticket price from Tianjin to Beiping of 9 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, plus the special express train surcharge for the round-trip through mileage of 18 yuan, and the round-trip ferry fee of 1 yuan, 2 jiao, totaling 111 yuan, 0 jiao, 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Light Snowfall in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

The farmers in the suburbs were delighted by this auspicious snow, and a bountiful harvest in the spring is expected. However, the climate in this city is mild and extremely dry, so pests have reappeared in the fields, and there are quite a few residents suffering from throat ailments. Farmers in the near suburbs were hoping for an early snowfall to eradicate the pests and cure those with throat ailments. Although the heavens sent light snow at around 11 AM yesterday, it stopped after only a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Kidnapper Abducts Child for Ransom</h3>
<p>Cheng Huasi, a 50-year-old Anhui native residing at No. 236 Xuzhen Road, Xujiahui, pulls a rickshaw for a living. He has a son named Xiaozhengzi, who is nine years old and whom he loves dearly. The child suddenly went missing the day before yesterday. Cheng searched everywhere without success. Just as he was at a loss, Wei Jiubing, a 33-year-old Yangzhou native residing at No. 5 Yaojiazhai, Hongqiao, volunteered to help Cheng, saying that he could find the lost child, but first he needed a reward of 20 yuan. Cheng, realizing that Wei Jiubing was acting like a kidnapper demanding ransom, reported the information to the Roberts Road Sub-precinct. Inspector Gu Wentao dispatched Chief Officer Zheng Bangcai and others to Wei's brother's house at No. 216 Meifang Lane, where they found the abducted child, Xiaozhengzi, hidden. They immediately took Wei Jiafa and his wife, Wei Songshi, to the precinct and transferred them to the Caojiadu Public Security Sub-bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Hengxin Lane, Wanyu Street</h3>
<p>At around 7 AM yesterday morning, five robbers broke into the home of Wu Jinyu at No. 5 Hengxin Lane, Wanyu Street, in the South City.

The robbers, still not satisfied, then entered the home of the second landlord, Fan Yan, in the same building, and ransacked it, stealing two gold bracelets. After looting both homes, the robbers gave a signal and fled with their loot. The chief of the Dongjiadu Police Station, Yi, upon hearing the report, immediately dispatched several police officers to surround the area. However, because the time was slightly delayed, the robbers had already fled far away, and they were not apprehended.</p>
<h3>Man Found Dead on Xixinqiao Street</h3>

According to the man, his name was Chen Deyi, 30 years old, from Pudong. He was unable to answer any other questions. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital, but he died from his illness on the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police station. Because it was impossible to trace the identity of the deceased, the body was taken to the autopsy site of the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall, pending a report to the Second Special Court today for officials to inspect the body. The deceased was wearing an old, dark-colored silk-lined camel hair robe, an unlined sesame wool long gown, a white short shirt, a taupe-colored wool shirt, dark-colored wool Western-style pants, and black leather shoes, resembling a middle-class merchant.</p>

<p>Gu Xiangzhou, also known as Shengzu, a 30-year-old man from Zhoupu Town, Nanhui, was from a well-to-do family. His parents were healthy. He married the daughter of the owner of Jiahelong Rice Store outside Xiaonanmen in this city. Gu used to work in the exchange but had recently been unemployed. For some unknown reason, he suddenly had a moment of short-sightedness. On the evening of December 30th of last year, he went to the Renhe Inn at No. 114 Dongzilaihuo Street in the French Concession and rented Room 28. That night, he committed suicide by poisoning himself. He had notified his family in advance. The next day at noon, the porter, Li Dangtian, knocked on the door to urge him to get up and discovered that he had been poisoned and was unconscious. He immediately reported it to the police station. Wei sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died that day. The police station sent the body to the autopsy site. Because it was the New Year, the court was on vacation. When his elderly father, Gu Liankui, received the news and rushed to Shanghai to visit, Gu had already died. On the morning of the 4th, the police station reported it to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who, along with the medical officer and clerk, went to the site to confirm the cause of death. The father claimed the body and coffin and transported them back to his hometown for burial.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Caught Robbing Meat Stall</h3>
<p>Mei Songshi, a woman from Shandong, recently opened a fresh meat stall at Xiaozhuchang, Taopeng Road, Yangshupu, with Shen Asi, a local man, as a partner. Their business was thriving. Zhao Wenfut and Zu Bingyan, gangsters from Anhui in the vicinity, coveted their business. One morning, they went to Shen Asi to buy meat for two yuan, but they insisted on buying on credit. Taking advantage of an opportunity, they snatched silver and copper coins worth six yuan and fled without a trace. Ms. Mei reported the situation to the Yangshuqing Police Station, which dispatched detective Ji Xiucheng to arrest Zhao and Zu at Zhoujiapai Road. They were taken to the police station for detention and were handed over to the Criminal Third Court of the First Special District Court yesterday. The victims, Mei Songshi and her partner Shen Asi, testified about the incident. When questioned, Zhao and Zu claimed that they were instigated by a fugitive named Xiao Ma and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>1936 China Insurance Yearbook Begins Pre-Order</h3>
<p>The China Insurance Yearbook Society, recognizing the backwardness of the insurance industry in China and believing that the crux of the problem lies in the lack of insurance statistics, has collaborated with the China Life Insurance Advancement Society to hire experts to compile an insurance yearbook to provide reference for those engaged in insurance and those studying insurance in China. The 1935 Insurance Yearbook was published in April of last year. Due to its abundant materials and accurate statistics, it has been widely praised by readers. People in the insurance industry, finance industry, libraries, business students, and those interested in the insurance industry have all eagerly purchased it. Sales have reached thousands of copies, which can be said to be a positive development in the midst of the economic downturn. Now, the 1936 China Insurance Yearbook is being compiled again. The content is divided into two parts: the main compilation and the appendix. The main compilation has ten chapters, including: The recent year's development of the insurance industry in China; A general overview of insurance companies nationwide; Surveys of the insurance industry in various regions; Insurance organizations; Insurance laws and regulations; Insurance statistics; Definitions of insurance terms; A directory of people in insurance companies; Insurance diaries; An index of insurance treatises. The appendix has four chapters, including: A general overview of the insurance industry in various countries; Business surveys of foreign companies in China; Developments of foreign companies in the past year; Foreign insurance associations. It is said that the compilation is being conducted very carefully, and the selection of materials is particularly precise, so the content is rich and can meet the needs of the general public. It can be predicted that the society has separated and become independent from the China Life Insurance Advancement Society, which contains foreign company components, to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. The society's address is No. 7 Tongchun Lane, Baker Road, and its official name is China Insurance Yearbook Society. However, the society is now carrying out this arduous task with the efforts of a few people, and their enthusiasm is commendable. Therefore, all sectors are providing assistance to reward them for their hard work in serving the Chinese insurance industry. The pre-order started on the 1st and was originally scheduled to end on the 15th. The price is four yuan, and the pre-order price is two yuan. To avoid disappointment for distant readers, it has been decided to extend the deadline by half a month. Therefore, it is expected that it will cause a sensation at that time, with people rushing to pre-order.</p>

<h3>Strange Incident Amidst Anti-Smoking Campaign: Photograph Published Claiming Addiction Recovery; Hospital Advertisement Uses Any Means to Promote It; Non-Smoker Falsely Accused of Recovering from Addiction – Chen Huihong Sues Sun Jianmin for Defamation –</h3>
<p>Sun Jianmin, a man from Shaoxing in his thirties, established Renhe Hospital at No. 191 Avenue Petain at the intersection of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession (opposite the Franco-Chinese School), serving as its director. He has recently been sued for defamation by Chen Huihong, a fellow doctor (29 years old, from Guangdong, and the chief physician at Ren Ci Hospital at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat), who, along with lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special District Court, seeking investigation and requesting compensation of two thousand yuan. The complaint alleges that the Renhe Hospital, established by the defendant, published an advertisement promoting smoking cessation on a certain newspaper on December 4th, which included several half-body photographs of people who had supposedly quit opium. The defendant placed the plaintiff's photograph as the eighth person in the bottom row, with the caption "Photo for Testimony, Real Name Omitted." The content further stated that "the above gentlemen all quit in October and received certificates from the rehabilitation center. Their photos will be published monthly for identification by fellow smokers." The plaintiff was astonished and outraged. He leads a clean and self-respecting life without any addictions. The defendant, formerly known as Sun Huilin, worked as a staff member in the Daxue Pharmacy established by the plaintiff's father and knows him well. The defendant is fully aware of the plaintiff's family background and appearance. Now, the defendant unscrupulously sacrifices the reputation of others as a tool to expand his publicity and achieve the goal of deceiving the public. The plaintiff feels deeply pained and has been reprimanded by his elders and advised by friends, as if the accusation were true, causing the plaintiff immense shame and significant damage to his reputation and mental well-being. The Special District Court Judge Sun Peng conducted a hearing, during which the defendant, Sun Jianmin, argued that the photograph was mistakenly sent to the newspaper for publication by the clerk, Shen Zixiang, due to temporary oversight, and that he has filed a separate lawsuit against Shen Zixiang for negligence. He also hired a lawyer for his defense. The court ordered the defendant to post bail and entrusted his lawyer to secure his release, pending a rescheduled hearing. The Special District Court has already concluded the trial of Sun Jianmin's suit against the clerk Shen Zixiang, acquitting Shen Zixiang. The court has scheduled a continued hearing for today morning in Chen Huihong's lawsuit against Sun Jianmin for defamation. It is rumored that relatives and friends of both parties have intervened, and Sun Jianmin has published an apology to the plaintiff in the newspaper, leading to a settlement and the plaintiff's withdrawal of the lawsuit.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>The Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company on Baker Road in this city has launched a new drug, a spleen-lung hormone preparation called "Pisu," opening a new era in Western medicine. Our reporter made a special visit and was personally greeted by Manager Zhu Duanfu. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he led the reporter to the manufacturing plant's office. Although the office was small, the arrangement was quite neat and clean. Through Mr. Zhu's introduction, the reporter also met the factory director, Mr. Hu Zhenhan, and the deputy factory director, Mr. Wang Shirong. Together, they took the reporter to tour the factory. The factory is divided into two parts: one is for manufacturing various finished products, located on the lower lip, and the other is for specialized manufacturing of injectable medicines, located on the second floor. The reporter first went to the finished product manufacturing area and saw various machines in operation. The sound of the machines was deafening. Under the guidance of Factory Directors Hu and Wang, the reporter learned the purpose of each machine, such as the Sharples ultra-high-speed centrifuge used to manufacture "Bulido," the mixer for extracting "Jiufu Gadger," and the vacuum distillation machine. According to Mr. Hu, the raw material for extracting "Gadger" is cod liver oil, from which about 1.5 to 2.0% of "Gadger" can be extracted, which is then used to mix with "Bulido" to enhance its nourishing function. Therefore, the effectiveness of "Bulido" can be imagined. In addition, there are also alkalizing machines, vacuum extraction machines, steam boilers, stone mills, and cod liver oil mixing machines, all used for manufacturing various finished products. A ultraviolet light room is also set aside in the corner of the field to manufacture Vitamin D. It is said that this is the initial work of manufacturing "Purple Light Malt Cod Liver Oil." Going further inside, the reporter saw an even larger area with more machines, including machines for manufacturing "Bailing Ji," "Milky White Cod Liver Oil," and "Sheng Dan," including a grinder, a powder mixer, a granule mixer, a sand grain manufacturing machine, a powder separator, a tray-type vacuum dryer, a tablet sorter, and eighteen tablet-making machines, occupying one-third of the entire area. There are also powder combination machines for making pills, pill-kneading machines, pill-making machines, coating machines, polishing machines, milky white cod liver oil mixing machines, oil-refining machines, and the latest type of Colin's oil combination machines. Outside the factory is the boiler room where the steam boilers are located. Then, the reporter exited the factory, climbed the stairs, and visited the injection manufacturing department. Upon reaching the second floor, the words "Clinic" were displayed horizontally in front of the reporter. The reporter inquired about the clinic's recent situation, and Manager Zhu invited the reporter into the room and showed X-ray images and temperature charts of patients with various stages of lung disease cured by "Pisu," and informed the reporter of "Pisu's" antipyretic effect on tuberculosis, as well as its cough-suppressing and weight-gain effects. At this time, poor and sick patients waiting for consultation outside the room were already standing by. The reporter then went straight to visit the rooms for manufacturing "Pisu." The rooms were all adjacent to the road, with sufficient light. From the storage of animal spleens to the manufacture of Pisu, a total of nine rooms are used. A rectangular porcelain sign is hung on the door, with the name of the department on it. The first is the raw material cold storage room, which is dedicated to storing animal spleens, using scientific refrigeration equipment to prevent spleen corruption. The second is the autopsy and organ component separation room. The initial work of "Pisu" is to dissect the spleen, extract and separate the active ingredients, and then go to the third room to dry them. After drying, the crude products are first manufactured in the fourth room, and then the crude products are placed in the centrifuge in the fifth room so that all the impurities in the spleen are separated by centrifugal force, and then sent to the sixth room for refining. After refining, the finished "Pisu" is then sent to the seventh room to be placed in ampoules, and then to the eighth room for disinfection. Once the disinfection is completed, the manufacturing process is completed. However, in order to determine the titer, a ninth room is specially set up for determining the titer and research. After inspection, it can be packaged and sold. The reporter was limited by time and did not have time to visit the packaging animal two rooms, so he bid farewell and returned. The factory has sophisticated machinery and a meticulous organization. What can be seen in the above can be seen. It is said that all the major doctors in Shanghai will be invited to visit to seek help from other mountains.</p>

<h3>Chen Lijang Discusses Impressions of Inspecting Education in the Southwest (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Lijang was previously hired by the Ministry of Education to inspect education in the southwestern provinces. He departed from the capital for Sichuan in October of last year, inspected Sichuan for a month, then flew from Chongqing to Guizhou. After completing his duties in Guizhou, he continued by plane to Yunnan for inspection, spending a total of three months. It is learned that Mr. Chen returned to the capital yesterday. Since the founding of the Republic, the Ministry of Education has not sent personnel to inspect the education of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, except for Sichuan. This time, Mr. Chen braved the long journey to conduct a detailed inspection. Now that he has returned safely, it is believed that Mr. Chen will have concrete suggestions for the future improvement of education in the Southwest to contribute to the central government. Therefore, our reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Chen at his residence. He appeared energetic despite his recent travels. After shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries, the reporter immediately inquired about the situation of education in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Mr. Chen's statements are as follows: "I was ordered by the Ministry of Education to inspect education in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan for three months. I will submit a separate report to the Ministry regarding the detailed current situation of education at all levels in the three provinces and the points that should be improved. Now, I will briefly describe the education situation in the three provinces as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sichuan: Sichuan's politics have been extremely dark in the past twenty years. Since the reorganization of the provincial government last year, everything in Sichuan has gradually been on track under the guidance of the central government. However, due to years of war and social economy, it is completely bankrupt. Therefore, the educational funding at all levels is very stretched, and the equipment is extremely simple. The specific details are as follows: (A) Sichuan University: It is undeniable that the past management was not good. Since Ren Hongjun was ordered to be the president, he has been determined to improve it, such as the employment of full-time professors, the enrichment of courses, and the purchase of books. Now, in order to make the school the highest institution of higher learning in the Southwest and cultivate talents, the central government has allocated 2.6 million yuan for the construction of school buildings and various scientific research equipment. Therefore, the future of Sichuan University is very optimistic. Secondly, the private West China University is well-managed, especially its dentistry department, which is the most famous. The museum attached to the school has a rich collection. As for Chongqing University, it has gradually improved since Hu Shuhua took over. (B) Sichuan Middle Schools: There are currently more than 270 schools. Although the number is large, the funding is uncertain and the equipment is very simple. Moreover, some counties have diverted funds from primary education to run middle schools. Therefore, in several counties, there are more middle schools than complete primary schools. This kind of畸形development has been discussed with the Education Department to formulate standards and find ways to improve it. (C) Sichuan primary school education is very bad due to poor local security and lack of funding in the past. If you want to make progress, you must try to rectify it. As for the short-term primary schools that have been reported for establishment, there are only more than 90 counties, and more than 50 counties are still missing. This is because although the central government issued a subsidy of 140,000 yuan this time, the provincial treasury did not raise a single point, and the local government only used the remaining administrative fees from the abolished bureaus to abolish the short-term primary schools, and this number is also very small and uncertain. I have consulted with the provincial authorities and asked them to find ways to raise funds and urge the counties to quickly establish short-term primary schools to comply with the central government's decree.</p>
<p>(2) Guizhou: Guizhou is poor and its people are poor. In addition, the past rulers were extremely plundering. The social economy is in an unthinkable state of depression. Since the reorganization of the provincial government last year, all undertakings have begun to have clues. Now the Education Department has plans for the province's educational facilities. The situation of education at all levels can be described as follows: (A) There is no higher education to speak of in Guizhou. As for secondary education, the school equipment is extremely poor. Each secondary school (rarely has student dormitories, and other things can be imagined). In addition, there is a lack of talent. Some teachers teach concurrently in several schools, and the number of teaching hours per week is as high as more than 36 hours. Currently, provincial middle schools are only in the provincial capital, and the funding is provided by the Education Department. As for the provincial middle schools in other counties, although they are called provincial schools, the funding is jointly raised by several counties. Now, after consultation with the Education Department, it is decided that student dormitories in each middle school must be built in stages, and the equipment must be enriched. Teachers who teach concurrently must be strictly investigated. The funding for provincial middle schools in each county should be borne by the provincial treasury, and the remaining funds should be returned to each county to run primary education. (B) Primary schools in Guizhou are even less developed, and the teachers' salaries are very low. As for the short-term primary schools, the central government subsidized 160,000 yuan, and the provincial government also raised 147,000 yuan (including Miao education funds). The province used this fund to run 615 short-term primary schools. Each school stipulates 250 yuan and runs a compulsory education experimental area. Because the education treatment of short-term primary schools is higher than that of ordinary primary schools, and there is money, the short-term primary schools are well-managed. (C) The Han and Miao people live together in Guizhou. The number of Miao people accounts for more than one-third of the province's population. Since Chairman Chiang advocated Miao education in Guizhou, the Education Department has also formulated a plan. In addition to short-term primary schools that also accept Miao children, six provincial primary schools have been established in the areas where the most Miao people live in the province, such as Libo, Danjiang, and Shuicheng, to specifically recruit Miao people. Another rural normal school has been established to train teachers for Miao education. A junior high school is attached to the school as a place for Miao children who are interested in further education. All are being actively carried out. The purpose of this education is to break down the barriers between the Han and Miao people and enable them to receive education with the Han people, so that they can be subtly influenced and effective invisibly. However, the living conditions, habits, and languages of Miao students are very different from those of Han people. Therefore, how to consider the gains and losses of the curriculum and teaching materials still needs our research.</p>

The required teachers are selected from normal students or registered and qualified primary school teachers. The mobile teachers are paid 150 yuan per year, and travel expenses are paid separately. When departing, they carry a mobile library for work. Each teacher is required to teach in three villages in rotation, and stay in each village for at least one week, teaching ten students. The Baojia chiefs are responsible for raising classrooms and teacher accommodation locally.

<h3>Sino-Western Charity Football Match Chinese Team Lost 2-3 Yesterday Led 2-0 in First Half Western Union Scored Three Consecutive Goals Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun Kicked Off Audience Was Huge</h3>
<p>The annual Sino-Western charity football match took place at Shenyuan at 3 pm yesterday. Mayor Wu Tiecheng's representative, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, performed the kickoff ceremony. The players of both teams were the elites of the whole city, and the attraction was strong. As soon as the midday bell rang, many spectators flocked to Shenyuan. As 3 pm approached, both the north and south stands were already full, with no space left. It is estimated that there were no less than four or five thousand people, a grand occasion unprecedented. As a result of the competition, the Chinese team unfortunately lost 3-2, causing the silver cup, which had been continuously maintained for two years, to change hands. After the game, Mr. Greenhow, the president of the Western Football Club, and Mr. Yu Hongjun gave speeches in Chinese and English. Then Mr. Greenhow presented the cup to Mr. Collasa, the captain of the Western Union team, for preservation. Finally, Mr. Greenhow auctioned off the ball, which was bought by Mr. Tan Jing, the organizer of the Chinese Tennis Club, for 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Frequent Missed Opportunities Prelude to a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>With the sound of the silver horn, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun moved the ball. The Western Union five forwards advanced together, circling twice in the Chinese territory. Finally, due to the initial thawing of the ice, it was unusually muddy and slippery, and both teams committed many fouls. Time flew by, and five minutes passed in an instant. The atmosphere was extremely dull. Zhong Yongsheng got Xu Jingcheng Gao Fu, and passed it to the center. Sun Jinshun dribbled past three levels, less than five yards from the goal, and sent a kick, but it obliquely swept past the goalpost. The audience was in an uproar. Yongsheng and Wenkui approached twice, but missed the opportunity again and again. Youliang passed in from the side line, and the landing point was excellent, but Wenkui's foot was too soft. Zhong Yongsheng broke through three levels alone. The Western Union defenses were all in the front line. Only Smelton was left in front of the goal. Zhong was too anxious and was sent out by Shi obliquely. All the good opportunities were missed one by one, which was a prelude to yesterday's miserable defeat.</p>
<p>Rongcai Saves Danger Iron Legs Bloom</p>
<p>The Western Union team launched a large-scale counterattack. Collasa pulled his bow and fired an arrow, which was forced into a corner kick by Li Ning. Youliang advanced alone and was also forced into a corner kick by Mashan'er. Neither side made any achievements. At that time, the ball circled under the Western Union's goal again. Yongsheng shot at the ten-yard mark, but he did not grasp it accurately and unfortunately hit Shi Huai. Bowserly got the ball in the middle line and attacked along the side. Under the Chinese goal, iron cavalry flew. Zhang Rongcai lay down and pounced out. Kampbell attacked remotely on the right line and was also waved out by Rongcai. Jia Youliang took the opportunity to force his way in, once knocking on the door, just right, but was caught by Smelton lying down and pouncing out. Two dangerous situations appeared in front of the Chinese goal again, all thanks to Zhang Rongcai's hard work, which was able to turn the danger into safety. Time was fast, and there was no progress in 30 minutes. Since China had escaped danger many times, the army advanced together, and Jinshun shot the main kick, which was forced into a corner kick by Mashan'er. Youliang opened the main kick, and the landing point was excellent. Jinshun waited for the right hit, and after a slight flick, the ball bounced into the goal from the right post, and China opened the record first.</p>
<p>Black Coal Has Great Merit Scores Twice</p>
<p>After the kickoff in the middle line, Western Union advanced in a big way, circling twice in the Chinese territory. Rongcai kicked the ball out of the goal line and was penalized for a free kick. Chaos formed in front of the Chinese goal again. Collasa stole the ball skillfully in a hurry and hit the net with his hand. The judge Jielun was quick-eyed and enforced the law like a mountain, announcing that it was invalid. Yongsheng got a high ball and dribbled past Mada and Mashan'er. He hammered the goal vigorously. Smelton blocked it out not far away. Chen Zhenhe rushed up and hit the corner of the goal, and the Chinese team opened the record again, taking a prominent lead with two to zero. After the kickoff, the Chinese offensive was extremely strong. Before long, Xiao Huater attacked along the side, hooked the center line, and Feng Yunyou kicked it not far away. Bowserly's head attack and Kai Mo'er's remote attack were all rescued by Rongcai from dangerous situations. Xiao Heitan got another good opportunity, but unfortunately he lost it because Jinshun was offside. McLaughlan fouled, and Jinshun's main kick was caught. Xiao Huater and his comrades launched a counterattack, and Bowserly and his colleagues advanced together. The silver whistle rang loudly, and the first half ended with the Chinese team taking the lead with two to zero.</p>
<p>Western Union Counterattack One Goal Was Taken</p>
<p>After the lemon, the battle began again. After the ball circled in the western territory for a while, it went to the Chinese territory again. Xiao Huater broke through alone, but fortunately went too high. Collasa attacked again, and Rongcai turned the danger into safety again. Zhenhe passed the ball to attack, reaching the bottom line, but he was too hasty and swept away obliquely. Youliang attacked remotely on the right corner, but after several rounds of attacks, there was no progress. Kai Mo'er and Bowserly advanced together, but they were all rescued by Rongcai from danger. Mashan'er was injured and left the field, and Western Union fought with ten people. Bowserly attacked the goal, Yunyou lost his footing, and Karen kicked it away. Rongcai rescued the danger again. Jinshun's counterattack failed and was counterattacked by the Western army. Bowserly was very powerful. He shot and Rongcai failed to save it. Western Union pulled back a goal, making it 2-1, and the Chinese team's gateway was opened from then on.</p>
<p>Two More Cities Were Lost Leading to a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>At that time, the ball was still in the Chinese territory. Zhenhe rescued the danger and rushed straight to the Western territory, but was blocked by McLaughlan. Jia Youliang caught up and passed in the middle. Black Coal added a kick, but was held out by Shi's hand. Bowserly attacked the gate again, urgently and sharply, but fortunately it rubbed the crossbar and passed. The Chinese five forwards advanced together and were rejected twice. The Western army circled and attacked. Kai Mo'er opened a corner kick, and there were several who almost entered, but fortunately they were not trapped. Zhenhe and Yongsheng made three attacks, but none of them were successful. Collasa and Bowserly went to the Chinese goal again, and they all cut through the post. The Chinese generals Jia Zhongsun and Chen lost their opportunities again and again. Xiao Huater attacked along the side and attacked the Chinese gate. Rongcai's rescue failed, and the Chinese were trapped again, forced to a 2-2 tie. However, before one wave subsided, another wave rose again. Bowserly attacked the goal again, and Rongcai slapped it out not far away. Collasa added a kick, and hit the target. Western Union won a goal by 3 to 2, but the second goal was less than three minutes away. Since then, although China wanted to work hard to counterattack, but time was passing quickly, the soldiers were tired, and the ground was unusually slippery and difficult to hold. As soon as Jinshun arrived in the Western territory, the silver whistle had already sounded. As a result, China failed by to . The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1) (4) (3)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Moore repeated the story of his loss. Mr. Bae listened, his face gradually becoming serious, because although the children had many minor faults before, they had not been fake.</p>
<p>"You sit down," he said, after everyone was seated, his gaze shifted from one face to another, a look of misery that was more uncomfortable to see than a scolding, while slowly saying:</p>
<p>"Children, now I want to ask each person a simple question, I only ask for an honest answer, I do not want to use intimidation, tricks, or cunning means to find out the truth of this matter; each of you has a conscience. The person who offended Tao Moore now has his chance to seek remedy and to repent before us all. I think it is sometimes excusable to be tempted by temporary desire, but cheating is different. So do not add lying to stealing, or confess clearly so we can try to help you make us forget about it."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, and the room was silent; then he slowly and solemnly asked this question of each person, although each person's please was a little different, the whole made the same answer. Each face was flushed, showing excitement, so Mr. Bae could not take the color as a sign. Several children were so flustered that they could not utter the simple words, as if they were guilty of a crime, but it was clear that they would not. When he asked Ned, he especially softened his voice, because the poor child looked so bitter, and Mr. Bae felt sympathy for him. He believed that he was a criminal, and hoped that the child would not dare to lie again, so he used an attitude of friendship to enable him to fearlessly tell the truth.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market at the Year-End and Beginning</h3>
<p>Initially Sold Off Heavily by Financial Institutions, but Ultimately Recovered Due to Short Covering by Retail Investors</p>
<p>Last week was the end of the 24th year of the Republic and the beginning of the 25th year, and the transition showed a different trend of volatility. At the year-end and beginning, there was a proposal for Japanese merchants to use Japanese currency in China, which was subsequently halted due to disagreement from the Japanese consulate, and market prices were once again shaken. This led to a strong rebound in the market. The situation in North China is becoming increasingly complex, and the overall adjustment is said to be underway. The public bond market has experienced many storms, and market sentiment is accustomed to it. If an event is not of significant severity, market prices are not affected by it, which shows the stability of market sentiment. The larger fluctuations in market prices occur during the anticipation of an event, and once it becomes clear, market prices stabilize. Take the currency reform as an example, the trends before and after the event were completely different. It is not that the event has changed, but rather that the balance of power in terms of capital has shifted to one side, and any excess or deficiency is enough to shake the market. Currently, the market is characterized by long positions held by retail investors and short positions held by large institutions. The environment is unlikely to undergo any major changes that would significantly affect the market, but infighting is inevitable due to the large volume of transactions and the short time frame. Last week only had three trading days. On Monday, financial institutions and gold merchants sold off, and the selling pressure from a large institution surnamed Sheng was also strong. This was compounded by the proposal for Japanese merchants to use Japanese currency, which was enough to shake the unification of China's currency. Market prices fell by several jiao to about one yuan, and then immediately rebounded. As a result, prices recovered by 1-2 jiao to 6-7 jiao. Wednesday to Friday were New Year's holidays and trading was suspended. On Saturday, the market opened strong and sentiment was excellent. The No. 43 representative bought on behalf of various groups, and retail investors also rushed to cover their short positions, resulting in a very positive trend and strong upward momentum, with prices soaring by several jiao to over two yuan. However, it was felt that the upward momentum was too sharp and difficult to sustain. As a result, prices rose by 2-3 jiao to 2.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was 63.53 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Cotton Market Reverses and Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened quietly, and all transactions were of a liquidation nature. The High Court's ruling will be announced on Monday, so both sides were engaged in reselling and repurchasing, with a relatively solid actual position. Prices rose due to buying by peers, but selling in the South caused the market to soften later as long positions were liquidated and New Orleans sold off. Increased textile sales indicate demand for goods from buyers, and factories also need cotton. The market closed weak, with spot prices unchanged and futures prices falling by 2-8 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 9 points, and futures prices fell by 4-5 points. Indian cotton fell due to large-scale selling by operators and scattered selling by European exporters. Prices subsequently weakened due to long liquidation and negative news from Liverpool. Pingor fell by 2 rupees, Oomra fell by 3-3.25 rupees, and White Rose fell by 3.25 rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left (4th day telegram).</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>On Snow</h3>
<p>— (Wei Jing)</p>
<p>The phenomenon of snow is truly peculiar. Snow that falls in winter is hexagonal, perfectly symmetrical, with each flake being identical. As it falls, it appears dry, and if it lands on you, a gentle brush of the hand easily removes it. However, snow that falls in spring is vastly different. Each snowflake is irregular, with some petals missing and others indistinct. As it falls, it melts easily. If it lands on clothing, it quickly turns into a drop of water. Although spring officially begins at Shen Shi (3-5 PM) today, snow falling before Wei Shi (1-3 PM) still exhibits the form and characteristics of winter snow. Snow falling at Xu Shi (7-9 PM) or Hai Shi (9-11 PM) takes on a completely different appearance, entirely characteristic of spring snow. Why is there such a clear distinction between winter and spring snow? I haven't found it discussed in science books, but I believe it's likely due to the different climate after the change of seasons.</p>
<p>According to common knowledge in our village, winter snow benefits agricultural products. The reason is that the cold of the snow can penetrate the dense soil, freezing to death any harmful insects or their egg masses that have burrowed into the soil in the autumn. Therefore, the more winter snow falls, the happier the farmers are, saying that "six-petaled snowflakes flying presage a bountiful year." As for spring snow, it is the farmer's great enemy because it can cause the tender wheat roots to rot. Therefore, I hope that Heaven sends down more snow this winter. Let the snow that is meant to fall next spring be finished off this winter.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Ancient Proverbs About Snow</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>When the weather is cold and the ground freezes, it is inevitable that snow will fall, and the editor of this column will naturally have to produce a "Snow Special Edition" to fit the occasion. So, I have taken two ancient proverbs about snow that were at hand, added new interpretations, and expanded them into an article to fill the blank space.</p>
<p>Snow Lion Facing Fire: "Snow lion facing fire" means unable to withstand. This is exactly like the current dating process of ordinary men and women. Unmarried women in their boudoirs are seeking sexual gratification. At this moment, as long as there is a man who is good at flattery and enticement, they will be unable to restrain themselves like a snow lion facing fire and will inevitably engage in unmentionable improprieties. At the same time, a virgin who has never had sexual relations with any woman, once he enters the world of feminine wiles, will be seduced by a woman who is used to romance, and he will become as limp as a lion facing the fire, at the mercy of others and unable to extricate himself.</p>
<p>In international affairs, we can also associate it with a small African country that actually dares to discuss war with a powerful nation. Its situation is clearly like a snow lion facing fire. But now the League of Nations is using collective force to sanction Italy. Italy, with its national strength, is confronting the whole world, and judging by the situation, it naturally seems a bit like a snow lion facing fire.</p>
<p>Sending Charcoal in the Snow: In ancient times, everything was said to be kind, but even then, there were few who sent charcoal in the snow. In these times, the world is falling apart, and the contrast between warmth and coldness is becoming increasingly sharp. Everyone is only looking out for their own interests. There are plenty who add flowers to brocade, but you can't find one or two who send charcoal in the snow out of a hundred. Those with wealth and power, with their thirtieth birthday, the old man's eightieth birthday, as soon as there is an action, there are many who follow the trend and flatter them. What about those who have lost power? When they go bankrupt and jump into the sea, everyone just laughs coldly at them. Someone who is willing to say a word or two of sympathy is already very kind. Anyone who is willing to send charcoal in the snow and provide assistance will be laughed at as the number one fool in the world. Look, most of the starving disaster victims are still waiting to die in the frozen world. From this, we can see how few people send charcoal in the snow.</p>
<p>As for international affairs, isn't it the same? If you don't have the strength yourself, don't even think about anyone being willing to speak up for justice. The powerful, at most, only sweep the snow in front of their own doors, who is willing to send charcoal in the snow?</p>
<h3>A Sunny Morning After the Snow</h3>
<h3>Snow Musings</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>After it snows, the happiest creatures are dogs, who love to run around on the snow. Each step leaves deep, plum-blossom-shaped footprints on the snow. At the same time, sparrows are unfortunately out of luck, as the ground's food is covered in white snow, causing them to chirp and squawk incessantly. Hence, the proverb "Snow makes dogs happy, sparrows angry" (perhaps the sparrows are also singing the praises of snow, but alas, the tongue of man knows not bird-speech, so we cannot prove it).</p>
<p>Children also welcome snow very much, throwing snowballs, building snowmen and snow lions, which is all good fun. When I was young, I also loved to play in the snow, and was often scolded by my parents for it. When I grew a little older, I realized that adults also love snow. Visiting plum blossoms in the snow, and composing poems about the snow are considered to be quite refined activities. In the "Rhyme Dictionary," there are so many references to snow. Since ancient times, there have been so many poems about snow that one could read them for three days and three nights without finishing. From this, one can know that adults' love of snow is no less than that of children.</p>
<p>In "The Story of the Stone," the eccentric Miss Miaoyu, residing outside the fold, collects snowflakes from plum blossoms in the winter, seals them, and stores them underground to brew pre-rain tea, and doesn't allow commoners to taste it, which is naturally a unique practice of the Buddhist sect. But in my hometown, old women would store winter snow water, treating it as a precious commodity, claiming that it could cure eye diseases, relieve throat pain, and even heal typhoid fever. Although this is a form of waste utilization, it is not mentioned in the medical book that Hua Tuo the doctor's wife burned, so I feel it's not something to be emulated.</p>
<p>Of course, all of the above is from before the 20th century. But the white snow, following the times, is still very popular today. Look, the 20th-century new poets, specializing in new-style poems, are still chanting about the snow. Mechanical photographers also get their cameras out and get to work when it snows. Artists who have returned from Rome and Paris also love to put snow scenes on canvas.</p>
<p>Also, it seems that snow is not only welcomed by gentlemen, but to put it in a distorted way, "elder sisters" and "aunties," and "silk factory girls," treat "snow-white" skin creams as their second life. If you praise a woman by saying "her skin is as white as snow," she will be happy from the bottom of her heart, and acknowledge you as someone who knows a good thing when they see it.</p>
<h3>Snow Morning</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the temperature on the thermometer suddenly dropped. After dinner, large, goose-feather-like snowflakes fell, and the shops closed their doors earlier than usual. My wife, the child and I huddled in the room, warming ourselves by the stove, and did not feel too cold. The next day, I was still in bed and dawn had not yet broken. Although I was covered with a silk quilt, the cold was pressing in fiercely! The bed was warm, and I was reluctant to get up. But the sunlight was already shining through the glass window, and looking out with the sunlight, the snow on the roof was exceptionally white and pleasing! I sat up in bed, washed and dressed, and after breakfast, I was reading a newspaper. Hanmei sent me an invitation card, inviting me to a snow viewing party at ten o'clock, with hot pot and warm wine. This was wonderful, especially since the weather was so clear.</p>
<p>There were a total of ten people at the party. Hanmei, the host, made the following suggestion: "I will give you a first line, and if you can't come up with a second line, each of you will be fined an old cotton coat. We think of the compatriots in the disaster area, crying from hunger and cold. It is so pitiful, with the cruel winter, the dripping water freezes, and there is such a heavy snow. When we are drinking and warm, we should put ourselves in the position of our compatriots in the disaster area! If we don't help them, won't they freeze to death?" Having said that, he gave us the first line, "Snow falls on the plank bridge, chickens and dogs pass, forming the shape of bamboo leaves and plum blossoms." Wang Jun proposed: "Let's assume our learning is shallow and each of us contribute a cotton coat." The others agreed, and it was decided to hand over the clothes to the People's Education Center to be delivered to the disaster area.</p>
<p>In such cold snowy weather, people with money should donate money to help, and those without money should donate a few clothes as well. It is hoped that people will actively contribute!</p>
<h3>A Snow Story</h3>
<p>— Shou Qiu</p>
<p>The weather is cold! The snowflakes have started to flutter! This has motivated me to write this article:</p>
<p>"Cold before frost, cold after snow." These are two Chinese proverbs. But let us not underestimate these two proverbs, they are very scientific. We know that after it snows, the weather will definitely get colder, so the poor people often shout that it is terrible! But on the other hand, snow is something that is beneficial to people. According to the term "auspicious snow" and the idiom "snow foretells a good year," we can know that snow is a good thing. If there is no snowfall in winter, that is terrible!</p>
<p>Speaking of snow, I am reminded of a story! This happened a couple of years ago. It is said that there was a family who sold wine in a certain place. This year, they could not afford to sell wine, so they had a lot of empty jars piled up at home, during the winter. It happened to snow heavily, and the wine seller, because he was so cold, used a spoon to scoop the hard snow into the empty jars. He scooped like this a few times, and he managed to fill more than a hundred jars! He was just playing around temporarily, and using this to resist the cold. Who knew that things would turn out unexpectedly. In the late spring and early summer of the following year, the area suddenly encountered an unprecedented drought. The rich people were holding silver dollars (at that time, the currency had not yet been reformed) and had nowhere to buy water. Just when they were very panic-stricken, the wine seller remembered the snow stored in the jars. He hurriedly opened one and looked, and it had turned into very clear water. So he leaked the news that he was selling each jar for one silver dollar. The rich people knew that it was snow water, and it was not easy to get, so they all rushed to send people to buy it. In less than two days, he had sold them all! He—the wine seller—also made a small fortune, which became his capital. This is the story of making a fortune from snow, but it is something that can only be met and not sought!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 23: Engaging in Lofty Discussions in the Room, Rising Up to Sue; Pouring Wine, Renewing Old Friendships, Forgetting Grievances for Profit</p>
<p>Today, Jia Duocai was surrounded by these female heroes. He used every trick he knew, both tough and soft, but nothing worked against them. His anger was so great he wished he could cut off his head to vent it. Now, seeing Wang Beihai standing aside, also mocking him with words, he couldn't contain his rage. He glared at him and asked, "Who are you? How dare you offend me with your words? Let me tell you, I'm not someone to be bullied."</p>
<p>Beihai seemed to have prepared a speech. He tugged at his collar, still smiling, and replied in a very gentle tone, "Mr. Jia, I recognize you. I know you're from the banking world. I won't argue with you. Perhaps I'm being kind, reminding you with my words. If you're trying to pick a fight with me, I'll let you win. You can say I'm afraid of you, and it wouldn't be wrong. I hope you can show that same fearless spirit when dealing with those ladies."</p>
<p>Saying that, he chuckled loudly, raised his right hand, shrunk his body, and retreated to the backyard. Jia Duocai stood in the reception hall, somewhat stunned. However, recalling Beihai's late arrival, he suddenly understood, thinking, "Could it be that troublesome guest has left?" He immediately ran to the room to look around, but no one was there. Sitting in a chair, he thought for a moment and then repeatedly slapped the table, calling for the tea boy.</p>
<p>The tea boy, seeing Yueying go upstairs, was already feeling uneasy about the situation. Now, hearing Jia Duocai calling out in such a chaotic manner, he blushed and entered. Jia Duocai pressed his hand on the table, jumped up, and asked, "Where's my wife?"</p>
<p>Just then, a burst of laughter came from outside the window. He put his hands on his hips, glared with wide eyes, and looked at the tea boy. The tea boy said in a low voice, "Your wife went upstairs to Commissioner Lan's wife's place." He answered very cautiously, keeping his hands at his sides and his head slightly lowered.</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said, "Go upstairs and call her back. Tell her this is a place of trouble, and I want to leave." The tea boy refused to leave, answering in a low voice, "I'm afraid I can't persuade her. Mrs. Lan said she was afraid Mr. Jia would want her back, so she's keeping her here." (387)</p>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>— (Ziming)</p>
<p>Snowflakes, like silver, fluttered and danced, adorning our land with a peculiar charm. The weather was piercingly cold, but the patriotic fervor of students in various regions was surging in inverse proportion. Students at a certain school were, of course, no exception; however, their movement was without freedom, constantly monitored and restricted. Their inner resentment burned even more strongly.</p>
<p>Dozens of students, in a flurry of activity, piled the snow on the ground into many snowmen. This snowman was a certain traitor, that snowman was a certain collaborator, all labeled with names; and the faces they made were indeed strikingly similar to the people they labeled. The students then armed themselves, taking wooden guns or broadswords, and chopped off the heads of the snowmen, hanging them at the school gate, as if to show all the traitors to the public.</p>
<p>This kind of foolish action may be close to being like Ah Q; but it also reveals the students' patriotic enthusiasm and degree of resentment.</p>

<p>Medical Lecture</p>
<h3>An Introduction to Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Doctor Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>After gonococci invade the human body, in males, they lurk in the folds of the urethral mucosa, and in females, they lurk in the glands of the cervical canal. This kind of gonococcal proliferation can continue throughout one's life. Therefore, intercourse with someone who has this disease will inevitably lead to transmission, with very few exceptions. When gonococci first invade the male genitalia, it is usually acute anterior urethritis. When gonococci invade the female genitalia, due to the complexity of the organ structure, sometimes adjacent organs are also affected.</p>
<p>This disease should be treated early, the earlier the better, otherwise, men infect women, and women infect men, creating an endless cycle of infection. However, one should be careful in choosing a doctor, so that the treatment is appropriate, strictly adhering to hygiene, so as not to hinder the healing process. Treatment must be proper and reasonable, such as shortwave diathermy, mixed gonococcal vaccine immunotherapy, "gonococcicide" oral medication, and "Gono-Serol" injection. Combining these methods can be said to be absolute treatment. With such treatment, there is no reason for gonorrhea not to be cured.</p>
<h3>Physical Strength and Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Physician She Lei</p>
<p>Those addicted to opium often have impaired physical health due to long-term exposure to opium toxins. Their physical strength is inferior to that of ordinary people. Therefore, at the beginning of withdrawal, one must first pay attention to their physical strength, that is, nutrition, and be careful in selecting nutritious foods. Then, physical strength can be improved, and the path to quitting smoking can be smooth.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if one does not consider the physical strength of the person quitting, pain will appear immediately after withdrawal, and there will be no good results. This can be stated with certainty. Regardless of the method used to quit smoking, nutritious foods such as milk, eggs, young chicken broth, beef broth, fresh vegetables, and fruits are all suitable. Medications used to increase the physical strength of those quitting smoking, such as egg yolk lecithin, various vitamins, Cerebro-Spinal Tonic, deer antler essence, various endocrine fluids, arsenic-iron iodide preparations, etc., all have considerable value. Other aspects, such as the conditioning of the nerves and gastrointestinal tract, are essential and cannot be ignored. This is because the physical weakness of those addicted to opium is very obvious.</p>
<p>While gradually eliminating the addiction, one should also gradually increase their physical strength. Then, those quitting will have no adverse reactions to the lack of opium's anesthetic effect. Any discomfort will only be mental. Quitting smoking in this way will be a peaceful experience.</p>
<h3>"An Er Shen": A Special Medicine for Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guofan</p>
<p>When a man reaches the age of puberty, which is the developmental stage, usually calculated by age as around sixteen, but varies due to region, environment, climate, etc., during puberty, the testicles enlarge, and sperm cells begin to divide to form sperm. The prostate gland, seminal vesicles, penis, etc., also develop, and all the characteristics of sex gradually appear. One understands sexual desire and feels shy and attracted to the opposite sex. Or, at night, sexual thoughts arise. Those who do not understand the dangers only seek momentary pleasure through masturbation. Over time, it becomes a habit, and eventually, the body weakens, the seminal gate is not secure, and one suffers from nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>Although some nocturnal emissions are not pathological, those that occur once or twice a week, or even every night, are all pathological. Even worse, there are those who experience seminal leakage during the day, such as during bowel movements, strenuous exercise, walking, sexual contact, or friction from clothing. As a result, one feels fatigue, headache, tinnitus, blurred vision, palpitations, mental depression, and weakness in the limbs, and becomes reluctant to work. Eventually, one's original yang is depleted too much, and all kinds of diseases invade, leading to severe neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Generally, young people do not understand the harm of masturbation and think that nocturnal emission is due to physical weakness. They do not realize that physical weakness is precisely due to masturbation. Modern medicine advances rapidly. A medicine like "An Er Shen" (Arolsen) can be said to be a symptomatic and effective medicine for treating this condition. I have used it in clinical practice and have often achieved good results.</p>
<h3>Two Special Medicines for Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is easily transmitted but difficult to cure. This is because gonococci are constantly lurking in the inner layer of the urethral mucosa. Ordinary medications cannot easily penetrate deep enough. Even if they can penetrate the membrane layer, directly killing bacteria is difficult, because the structure of the bacteria includes a capsule, making them more difficult to eradicate than ordinary bacteria without capsules.</p>
<p>The medications usually used to treat gonorrhea are either oral or topical. Inferior oral medications, such as those containing strong astringent ingredients, show temporary effects but make treatment more difficult. Other medications for gonorrhea, such as Copaiba and sandalwood oil, are not only ineffective but also irritate the kidneys and harm the gastrointestinal tract, so one should try to avoid using them.</p>
<p>In my clinical practice, I want to find a reasonable oral medication for treating gonorrhea that has no side effects and is truly effective. Is "Mesaltropin" the answer? The excellence of this medicine can be confirmed by the fact that it is favored by doctors at home and abroad. The medicine is completely based on the latest scientific principles and made with special chemical methods. Its ability to penetrate membranes and kill bacteria is unmatched. Regardless of whether the bacteria are encapsulated or hidden deep in the folds of the mucosa, the medicine can penetrate the membrane layer and directly act on the bacteria to kill them.</p>
<p>As for topical medications, silver proteinate and potassium permanganate are usually used as topical washes for treating gonorrhea. However, the bactericidal and membrane-penetrating abilities of these medications are not accurate. What is favored by the medical community nowadays is "Gono-Serol." This medicine is made from gonorrheal serum and can achieve automatic immunity. It is effective for urethral lesions. I have repeatedly tested the above two medicines, or recommended them to patients, and none have failed to achieve complete cure.</p>
<h3>A Famous Skin Medicine Cured My Acne</h3>
<p>— Liu Wenmei</p>
<p>The famous skin medicine "Misulzine" has always been known for its ability to treat scabies and ringworm. My wife's stubborn neck ringworm was cured by it. I have recommended this medicine to friends and relatives suffering from various skin diseases, and all have been cured. Recently, I heard from a friend that his acne was cured by "Misulzine." I have had acne for years, and because it did not have a significant impact on my health, I ignored it for a long time. Some said it was related to blood, others said it was something one should expect during youth, but there was no miracle cure. Now that I heard my friend's words, I immediately tried the method and treated it. In just ten days, the clusters of bumps on my cheeks, nose, forehead, and eyebrows had disappeared without a trace. Such a good medicine deserves praise. I know that many people suffer from this disease, so I write this to inform the public.</p>
<h3>A Record of Recovery from Years of Stomach Trouble</h3>
<p>— Ni Mutian</p>
<p>I have been suffering from stomach trouble for a long time, probably due to carelessly eating cold, raw, spicy food and drinking alcohol. Years have passed without a cure. I have seen doctors several times, but with little effect. According to the doctors, it is chronic gastritis. I have bought and taken five or six kinds of over-the-counter stomach medicines, but they only provide temporary relief, and the problem recurs. I have not been able to find a radical cure.</p>
<p>Due to this ongoing problem, my appetite is poor, my digestive power is weak, my nutrition is inadequate, my body is weak, and my spirits are affected, losing their former vitality. Even more unbearable, during attacks I experience nausea, vomiting, stomach bloating, loss of appetite, and excruciating abdominal pain that is indescribable. The illness makes me feel hopeless.</p>
<p>Previously, I was introduced by Dr. Jiang Guofan of this publication, who said that "Wei Bao" (Stomach Treasure) can cure difficult stomach ailments. I immediately bought it from the Nanyang Pharmacy and took it according to instructions. For more than two weeks, not only have my old symptoms not reappeared, but my appetite has also recovered, and my spirits and energy are even better than before. I write this article to thank this good medicine.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>

<p>Reduced Gonorrheal Discharge (Asked by Mr. Hu Shaochu) I unfortunately contracted gonorrhea. I immediately bought "Mesaltropin" pills from a Chinese and Western pharmacy and took them orally. In the past three days, the pain has been relieved and the gonorrheal discharge has decreased. However, I need to leave Shanghai urgently. Please recommend a topical gonorrhea medicine so that I can use it in combination to recover quickly.</p>
<p>Answer: "Mesaltropin" is a sacred product among oral medicines for gonorrhea, and it is appropriate to use it to treat gonorrhea. Among the good topical medicines for gonorrhea, the urethral injection of "Gono-Serol" for immune therapy of gonorrhea is quite effective.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>The Brutality of Italian Aircraft</h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>Just as people were celebrating the New Year with great excitement, a shocking tragedy came from East Africa, reporting that the Swedish Red Cross rescue team had been bombed by Italian aircraft. According to a dispatch from the capital of Abyssinia on New Year's Eve, "Our reporter, Ochanert, reports that several Italian aircraft flew to the Dora area on the southern Wolga Den front line and dropped bombs, destroying all the buildings of the Swedish Red Cross service team there. All the members of the team, except for the leader, Dr. Hilante, were killed. One nurse and one assistant were not killed, but were seriously injured. ..."</p>
<p>As soon as this tragedy spread, public opinion around the world was in uproar. The Surgeon General of the Swedish Army declared: "The Italian army did not do such evil during the European War." Some bishops even said, "The honor of the whole world is feared to be tarnished by this tragedy." Newspapers in the Swedish capital issued extra editions, "Crowds of people thronged the streets, immediately held demonstrations, expressed opposition to Italy, and hundreds of people gathered in front of the Italian embassy, and in a fit of anger, some people punched and waved their arms." The King of Abyssinia also notified the League of Nations one day, protesting the inhumane violence of Italian aircraft.</p>
<p>The Italian imperialist war of aggression against Abyssinia is vociferously "promoting culture" for the white race. The result of this "promotion of culture" is that the Abyssinian people and the wilderness of East Africa are devastated by the "civilized" artillery fire of the white race, and the black people of Abyssinia are trampled upon by Italian imperialism in the same way as India. The world is watching this cruel resistance of a semi-colony against imperialist aggression and sympathizing with Abyssinia for this indomitable anti-resistance sentiment. And the Swedish and other countries' Red Cross rescue teams' going to East Africa to rescue the wounded soldiers of Abyssinia is precisely a clear manifestation of this great sympathy. These Italian aircraft, ignoring the criticism of general opinion and the aversion of the world's people, in addition to "promoting" the people of Abyssinia, also bombed the innocent Swedish rescue team, which clearly exposed the essence of the so-called "promotion of culture" by Italian imperialists.</p>
<p>No matter how the Italian fascists try to argue that this was a "punishment" of the Abyssinians by "Italian military aircraft" and that "there was no intention to harm the Swedish Red Cross," facts speak louder than words, and the hideous face of the Italian fascists has been revealed in this brutality.</p>
<h3>The Spoken Drama in China in the Year 24</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>"From now on, spoken drama will be eliminated!"</p>
<p>The person who said this felt that sound movies not only possessed the advantages of spoken drama, such as voice and dialogue, but could also overcome the limitations of time and space imposed on spoken drama. Naturally, this statement is not without reason, but anyone who truly understands art would not say such a thing.</p>
<p>In the realm of art, the relationship between spoken drama and film is like that between poetry and novels, painting and photography—each has its own inherent differences and unique advantages. The emergence of novels does not lead to the demise of poetry, nor does the invention of photography lead to the extinction of painting. Rather, because of the new emergence, both will gradually abandon their respective strengths and weaknesses, complementing each other and advancing to higher stages of art.</p>
<p>The spoken drama movement of the year 24 did not decline and disappear due to the emergence of Chinese sound movies. On the contrary, the booming phenomenon of the spoken drama movement this year is astonishing. Not only in its vigorous atmosphere, but also in the establishment of new techniques derived from new content, further consolidating the value of spoken drama in the realm of art.</p>
<p>The flourishing of the theatrical movement in the year 24 owes considerable credit to the Shanghai Stage Association's performances of "Song of Rejuvenation" and "Under the Mercury Light" at the beginning of the year. Not only were the Melo and entertainment aspects of the plays themselves tailored to the tastes of ordinary small town residents, but the "personal appearances" of more than twenty movie stars, large and small, were indeed enough to create box office records for spoken drama. The convenience of renting theaters for subsequent public performances by several theater groups, and the slight improvement in business, owe no small debt to the former.</p>
<p>Although the script of "Song of Rejuvenation" suited the tastes of the petty bourgeois audience, excessive romanticism not only diluted the anti-imperialist fervor into a faint brushstroke, but the superficial narration and excessive emphasis on entertainment did not achieve a deeper harvest in terms of performance effect. Zhao Dan's earnest acting earned much praise, and Yuan Muzhi's makeup and small gestures were also praised by the general public.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>It's a pity that he stole the show from others.</p>
<p>However, in "Under the Mercury Light," Yuan Muzhi's calm and refined acting not only lacked the aforementioned shortcomings, but also made a significant contribution to the overall success of the play. His contribution should be considered half of it.</p>
<p>Here, in addition to inheriting the excessive romanticism of "Song of Rejuvenation," the lengthy dialogue describing past history destroyed the atmosphere of the entire play.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the directing skills can be said to be passable, although some minor flaws remain, such as the disorganization of the scene in the second act of "Song of Rejuvenation."</p>
<p>The film "Smilin' Through," starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, was adapted from the stage play "Fresh Paint," which was publicly performed by the Jinan Drama Society.</p>
<p>Although "Fresh Paint" had the efforts of the director and a lighthearted script, it failed to fully grasp the emotions of the Chinese audience due to differences in living environment. The stiffness of the lines and the triviality of the actions of two or three actors further damaged the overall effect of the play. Shu Yan was quite skilled, but Wang Ying, who played the role equivalent to Norma Shearer, failed to express the demeanor that an old maid should have in her movements and makeup.</p>
<p>The play "L'Arlésienne" by the Qingzhong Drama Society also failed to be fully understood by the general audience due to differences in living environment. The lack of colloquialism in the dialogue was also a fatal flaw. Fortunately, Gu Er'yi's captain and Zhu Mingxian's mother slightly enlivened the whole play.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for acting in spoken drama is the naturalness of the dialogue and the clear distinction between high and low tones, but the "Midsummer Night's Dream" performed by Qingxin Girls' High School did not possess this condition. The gorgeous costumes did not compensate for the unfamiliarity of the whole play.</p>
<p>John Drama Society's "The White Haired Girl" easily won some success in performance due to the terror, comic relief, and low-grade趣味 inherent in the script. Although "Freedom" deeply portrayed four different personalities, the unfamiliarity of the actors and their lack of deep understanding of the characters meant that the effect of the performance depended on "The White Haired Girl." The familiar "Thief," with the help of lighting and scenery, was still able to capture the emotions of the audience.</p>
<p>The "Storm on the Yangtze" and "Three Sisters" performed by Peiming Girls' High School did not achieve higher success. "Oppression" received considerable praise due to the lighthearted script and the efforts of actors such as Shen Ruchen, although it was far inferior to the former in meaning. "A Doll's House (Nora)," which was performed in Nanjing and then in Shanghai, was first performed at the Guanghua Affiliated High School, and the overall effect of the play achieved limited success. The director did not handle the whole play in an orderly manner, and although Kang Zhang worked hard, she did not fully understand the personalities of the characters.</p>
<p>Fudan Drama Society's "Compromise" achieved completeness in both the script itself and the performance techniques. The director's efforts were evident in the small gestures and the grand settings, and actors such as Feng Zi and Gu De'gang were very competent. Although it was also a satirical comedy, it was much better at manipulating the audience's emotions than "Fresh Paint" because of its proximity to life.</p>
<p>"Friends in Trouble," "Chastity," and "Farewell" were the three plays performed by the Ma Yi Drama Society in its second public performance. The selection of the scripts and the effect of the performances were not as successful as expected.</p>
<p>The "Modern Lady" performed at the Shanghai Theater was not significantly different in form from the general stage plays recently performed in China. Unfortunately, the director was contaminated with a bit of the style of early Chinese "spoken drama," although actors such as Hong Ying worked hard. The main idea of the whole play was to persuade modernized women to return to the family. The author's painstaking effort was to improve people's hearts.</p>
<p>Although amateur actors performed the familiar play "A Doll's House (Nora)" for the first time, this play is worth performing again and again in the current situation where women are not allowed to enter society.</p>
<p>The dedication and effort of the director and actors made the performance of the whole play a great success. The acting skills of Lan Ping, Zhao Dan, and Jin Shan here also received widespread praise.</p>
<p>Although "Hero and Beauty" is a very good satirical play, the Jizhong Drama Society did not make enough effort. The messy settings, stiff movements, and forced dialogue ruined the entire play.</p>
<p>The Hua Hua Drama Society, which wanted to improve business by renaming "Dunce" as "The Merry Widow" and performing it, had unexpectedly dismal box office results. In terms of form, it was almost completely Peking Opera-ized.</p>
<p>The "Xi Shi" performed by the Shanghai Theater for the second time was also almost completely Peking Opera-ized in form.</p>
<p>The "Moon Bends" performed by the Star Film Company almost completely inherited the techniques used in the first performance of the Shanghai Theater.</p>
<p>The Experimental Drama Troupe's performances of "The Miser" and "Oppression" did not achieve anything good either.</p>
<p>John Drama Society also performed "Returning South," "Friends in Trouble," and "Tunnel," but it seems that they did not pay careful attention to stage techniques.</p>
<p>Among the satirical comedies publicly performed in the year 24, "Untitled" was the most commendable in terms of its positive significance. In particular, the help of the sound effects and the sudden change of lighting at the end added a lot of color to the whole play. Except that the overall tone was not bright enough, the whole play was hilarious from beginning to end. Gu Er'yi's magistrate, Lan Ping's carpenter's wife, and Ye Luxi's daughter were all very skilled. Jin Shan seemed unable to fully fit the personality of the character in the play, and although Wang Ying worked hard, she still maintained the style she had in "Fresh Paint."</p>
<p>Fudan Drama Society's four-act tragedy "Thunderstorm" also made considerable achievements. The playwright used a deep and tragic tone to expose the ugliness of a large family. The director also put a lot of effort into the small gestures, and actors such as Hu Nianzhong and Feng Zi were very dedicated.</p>
<p>Qiazhong Girls' High School performed "One Night in a Northeastern Girls' Dormitory." In the current Chinese situation, this play is the most worthy of recommendation. It pointed out the future path for the students, and at the same time sharply satirized student life. The performance was still barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>This is a very general and rough record of the spoken drama movement in the year 24. Errors and omissions are inevitable. The liveliness and vigor of spoken drama in the year 24 are commendable and gratifying. Although some nondescript things are mixed in, that is unavoidable on the road of development. The creation of new content and the establishment of new techniques resulting from new content have rapidly advanced the backward Chinese spoken drama to another higher stage. Now that the national crisis is deepening day by day and the patriotic and saving movement is expanding day by day, recognize the duty you should fulfill in your own field and redouble your efforts, friends who are engaged in spoken drama!</p>
<h3>Singing Girl</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>When the street lights begin to shine brightly, a group of young girls dressed in gaudy clothes appear outside the bustling Qianmen gate.</p>
<p>They are engaged in the business of singing. As soon as the sun sets, they take off their tattered short shirts and change into a set of brand new clothes, apply snow-white fragrant powder on their yellow and thin faces, smear fragrant and smooth pomade on their disheveled hair, and dab bright rouge on their withered lips. They stroll gracefully onto the streets, going in and out of the brothels in the Eight Great Hutongs, enticing guests to buy their songs, subjected to the guests' lewd teasing and ridicule, the girls' contemptuous glances and insults... until late at night, they drag their weary steps back home. These little girls, living what appears to be a rosy life but is actually gray and white, are the singing girls who visit hundreds of doors.</p>
<p>Sixi Zi has been doing this business for more than two years. She started following her grandfather in this business at the age of fourteen. Whether it was winter or summer, whether it was snowing or raining, she went out every day from dark and did not return home until late at night, when the father and daughter walked back home like two ghosts in the dark alley.</p>
<p>"Sixi'er, hurry up and dress up, you think it's still early, don't you?" It was her mother's voice, speaking with a reproachful air.</p>
<p>"Mom, wouldn't it be nice if you let me rest for one night? We earn enough money to make a living," Sixi'er threw the work in her hand into the sewing basket and stood up to say this.</p>
<p>"Sixi'er, you're not young anymore, and you should share some of Mom's worries," her mother's voice softened a little. "Mom is telling you, don't make your dad angry, be good, and go. It's getting late."</p>
<p>Sixi'er didn't speak, picked up the work, and lowered her head to continue.</p>
<p>"Your grandfather is so old, but he's still the same. Has he ever taken a day off? You, you should still go!" Her mother seemed to be pleading. "In a while, I'll ask your sister to help you out. When she learns, you won't have to go out anymore."</p>
<p>"In a while, it's always in a while, when will it be?" Sixi'zi rolled her eyes, glaring at her mother. "I won't go, I'd rather die than go, I'd rather starve to death. We'll never suffer this hardship again!"</p>
<p>Her mother was stunned and couldn't say a word. She knew that doing this business was hard, and her daughter was growing up. She felt distressed in her heart when she was subjected to the guests' lewd teasing, but what could she do? Since her dad has been idle, doesn't the family's food, clothing, and supplies depend on Sixi'er's mouth? After a pause, she persuaded again,</p>
<p>"Good child, listen to Mom! Any hardship is worth enduring. If you don't go, won't you let your dad and Mom starve to death? Don't let your dad hear you, or he'll start arguing again."</p>
<p>"Endure! Endure, do you know what it's like? People touch you and touch you, and you have to let them do whatever they want for a few cents? What's the difference between us and the girls in the 'lower places' (a name for the lowest-grade brothels in Beiping)? And now this market, there aren't many people listening in the 'lower places.' Although there are more in the 'tea houses,' the gatekeepers want a tip for opening the door (a kind of extra money for the doorman), not even a penny less. Even if your business is good, you go to ten or twenty places, and you shout until your voice is hoarse, but you don't end up with much money. The girls in the group are good at getting good things from the guests' hands, and they always say that the rewards are too much, and they have to deduct from it. And..." Sixi'er said here, tears fell down her face, and her chest convulsed violently. Then, she rubbed her chest hard with her hands, while saying intermittently:</p>
<p>"And those bastards... When they see you... A slap on the right side,... a kick on the left,... twisting your hair... giving you a whip... to eat,... look," she pointed to the purplish-black bruise on her arm, "it wasn't just from them twisting me last night: Mom... Mom, I'd rather die than go out, I... I... work at home..." Sixi'zi couldn't say anymore, lifted her skirt to wipe her tears, and coughed dryly, unable to breathe.</p>
<p>"Xi'er, don't say it, Mom loves you," the mother's voice was also a little hoarse.</p>
<p>Just then, her dad ran out, coughing and panting.</p>
<p>"Xi'er, I'm telling you, isn't everything in the world the same? When I used to work for the opera troupe, I suffered even more than you! That is to say, they are people who have something, do you know? Which rich person doesn't use their power, doesn't look for fun? Otherwise, what are they doing in the brothels? You always have to endure some things. If you don't go, we'll have to tighten our belts tomorrow! Alas, I only blame my bones for being hard. Now it's a famine year. Otherwise, I wouldn't let my own daughter be played with by others, played with in front of me, you say..."</p>
<p>"Enough! You always say endure, endure, endure. When will we stop enduring? Aren't people all made the same way? Why do we have to be played with by them? Can't we just starve to death if we do other businesses? Tell me, have you ever suffered those hardships?"</p>
<p>"Okay!" Sixi'zi threw away the work in her hand and stopped crying, shouting loudly. "Okay, we'll take one more trip tonight. If anyone touches me, I'll slap them in the face. If I ruin the business, don't blame me."</p>
<p>"Doing this kind of thing isn't human, hey:..." Sixi'zi took off her outer shirt and walked into the room angrily.</p>
<p>When the street lights began to shine brightly, a group of young girls dressed in gaudy clothes appeared outside the bustling Qianmen gate. Among them, there was Sixi'zi.</p>
<h3>Brought Good News</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>—Nostalgia for a Bitter Snow, Part 3—</p>
<p>Loneliness, on the solitary, may be appropriate, no, for one of leisurely taste, it can indeed regulate the spleen and stomach, for a wandering person whose heartstrings have been burned by fire, for a wanderer overwhelmed by all the suffering and melancholy, loneliness, that is not needed, in the silence where all sounds are quiet, it can bring endless troubles, sorrows, all into the brain, revolving, revolving, like a zoetrope, at the same time, a merciless arrow will unceremoniously pierce straight into the chest.</p>
<p>Don't you not want to be lonely? This thought cannot be done, every day, opening your eyes, the sky always seems to have immense sorrow, pulling down a bitter face, in a small room with only one window, shrouded all day in dreary clouds, there is no smile on each person's face. In the morning, scrambling out of the covers, casually wiping a face, clutching a hopeful mood, hurriedly going their separate ways.</p>
<p>What about me? This is difficult, not being the person in charge, one might even be treated as a greenhorn by the person in charge, everything, naturally, must be subject to the orders of others. Wanting to go out to change the stuffy air, unfamiliar with the route, and the snow is so heavy, it will bury your feet. Although a greenhorn would not get lost, the face of the person in charge is not good to look at after all.</p>
<p>Contacting, unblocking, busy coming forward all day, the hopeful mood, when brought back, is a lump of frustration. When the oil lamp is placed in front of our faces, there is almost always a burst of complaints.</p>
<p>-How was it when you went to see Commander × today?</p>
<p>-Difficult, all official language, nothing was indicated.</p>
<p>-Then, Lao Wei said: are we just going to stop here and not leave?</p>
<p>-Leave? Who has this way, we already knew, this departure was an adventure.</p>
<p>A cloud of thick smoke separated everyone, in the thick smoke, everyone quieted down!</p>
<p>The charcoal fire was burning brightly, the ice surface already formed in the courtyard, groaning and creaking with the footsteps of passers-by.</p>
<p>-I really don't believe there will be one, who would squat in the no man's land of Zhengzhou.</p>
<p>Brother, don't talk, now you should believe it, everything, can never be affirmed in ideals.</p>
<p>-Damn it, I was still saying that I would rush back to Tianjin to celebrate the New Year on the 28th or 29th!</p>
<p>Lao Liu glanced at Xiao Wei's face and said faintly: "Forget it, before the New Year, the sister-in-law doesn't have the good fortune to get your warmth.</p>
<p>Laughter spread from one person to the whole group, Xiao Wei's face was not thick after all, and he couldn't help but blush.</p>
<p>Xiao Wei is a young man full of enthusiasm, married for just three or four months, for the sake of life, the whip drove him to this twilight ancient city, if in an unintentional moment, one mentioned their own woman to each other, then he, would滔滔不絕narrate her merits, his heart itching, and his face would follow and turn red.</p>
<p>-Tomorrow, really, I'll go to ××× and ask him to think of a way, Xiao Wei said, if it doesn't work, we'll still go back, don't wait here anymore. You have to spend money, you have to socialize, if there's no money, we'll just wait to die!</p>
<p>Of course, we are happy to accept this proposal, for the sake of convenience in speaking, we had to ask Xiao Wei to bother.</p>
<p>The next day, the fiery red sun shone on the east, the sky was a clear mirror, the accumulated snow, daring not to resist as usual, the texture melted, dripping and dripping, the dirt road on the street was muddy and slippery.</p>
<p>Maybe today can bring us good news? The sky, in bringing a symbol of glory. I thought in my heart.</p>
<p>The air in the room was the same as before, lonely, I guarded the lamplight and looked through the news of the day, letting the time slip by on every small character and every paragraph of advertisement. Later, they came back, and as soon as they entered the door, they brought unusual joy.</p>
<p>——Oh, how much explanation it took, we finally have a definite date, we're setting off on the 25th, the day to go home for the New Year won't be delayed哟! He shouted wildly, laughed, and his passionate eyes were a little charming.</p>
<p>A table of dishes was ordered, the good news, rippling in everyone's heart. I don't know who suggested it, but two more flower girls were called to pour wine. Passion, revelry, everything was forgotten in the revelry.</p>
<p>All the hopes, tightly fastened to the galloping of the vehicles, counting down, there should still be a week of stay!</p>

<p>Opening: "Xiang Ling Asks After Illness"</p>
<p>Vast twilight gradually descends. The rustling breeze and fine rain drizzle. Dim and silent is Xiang Ling's abode. Desolate and lingering are the shadows of slender bamboos. The carefree master of Yi Hong is a man of passion. He thinks of the melancholic, sickly woman. Wearing his bamboo hat and raincoat, he hurriedly carries a lantern through the garden. Arriving at the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, the lady has just put down her brush, ceasing her poetry. A maid suddenly announces the arrival of the Second Master. He appears, dressed in a manner different from usual. "Brother Bao, why do you imitate the attire of a fisherman?" The master, hearing this, quickly inquires, "Is Sister's health peaceful? Has your medicine been taken? Has your appetite improved? You mustn't write poetry these days. My heart is constantly burdened, hence I brave the rain to inquire." "If Sister likes this attire, I shall send her a set on a pleasant day." Qing replies, "Why would I need such a thing? The image of a fisherwoman is meaningless." As the words leave her lips, she ponders. "Fisherman and fisherwoman should not be mentioned." Her peach blossom face flushes with uncontainable shame. Silently, she lowers her head, not uttering a sound. One unintentionally misspoke. The other has not heard the truth, how would she know the feelings? The Dream of the Red Chamber is full of changes and illusions. Briefly depicting that, Xiang Ling inquired after illness, a marital fate. I hate that the old man in the moon does not draw a thread of love. Hence, medicine is always ineffective. In vain do they bear a mutual affection.</p>

Young and beautiful, with delicate features and red makeup, these women diligently serve, arriving early and leaving late. There is a newly established department store. Its scale is grand and extraordinary. The recruitment conditions for female office workers require beauty, youth, and elegant demeanor. That beautiful woman is untouched by worldly dust, without vulgarity. A fragrant, eloquent flower, a jade that exudes fragrance. Meeting an unkind person is a common lament. How hateful is her husband's lack of resolve. He abandoned his five-year-old child for a flirtatious woman. He left last year, with a cruel heart. Almost a year has passed without news. Her clothes and jewelry have all been pawned. Fortunately, the child is lively. A pearl in her palm, loved beyond compare. She apprehensively applies to the company. After a few days, her name appears at the top of the list in the newspaper. She diligently works, arriving every day. Her colleagues send the beauty "flower vase" comments, and the manager, greedy and lustful, is like a madman with the beauty by his side. Evil gold tempts her. Xiang Wang and the Goddess of Mount Wu meet in Gao Tang. One day, as the two are deep in passion, a phone call brings news of disaster. The "flower vase's" house is suddenly destroyed by fire. Her child dies. Her heart is cut like a knife, her liver and intestines break. Boundless grief fills her eyes with tears. After weeping over the body, she drifts away, regardless of people's gossip. It is said that she has shaved her head and entered a nunnery.</p>
