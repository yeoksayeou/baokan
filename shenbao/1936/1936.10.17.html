<h3>遠東日英美三角關係（下）</h3>
<p>— 宜譯</p>
<p>同樣地，太平洋的時勢顯示着日本的侵略非但沒有减削「中國革命」的危險性，實際上反而使這危險性加深了。般的國際局勢顯得英國不能跟遠東的衝突隔絕，要防止世界戰爭，英國非採取對抗日本的步驟不可。然而英國的動員範圍却已有了限度。在尖銳的歐洲局勢中間，手脚都縛住了，它再也不能用武力來作要脅的手段。而且日本在華北的比較的，成功已經使日本要在有限度的擴張範圍上跟英國講條件的念頭减小了。不但如此，美國因了自國的政策的轉移，再也不能當作日本的對等勢力來「看待」。因此英國不得不首先打定主意來保護自國在遠東的利益。</p>
<p>美國呢，重復着眼於東方來「利用」英國了。羅斯福政府產生以後，美國採取了新的策略。新政府實施着史汀生主義，可是對於日本一步步的進展，再也沒有響亮的抗議投送給日本了。在另一方面，「經濟」上的企圖停止了，巨大的海陸軍的建設計劃則開了頭。每逢英國的憂慮增加起來，美國就抱着這麽一個態度：英國在遠東有着比美國損失得更大的危險。它的投資和它的帝國在那裏更來得大。因此英國較之美國更應站在對日本的前綫上。退出斐律賓的政策雖然發動於國內的經濟利益，可是那些想望着從新加坡和印度的大門，撤除美國的保護勢力，從而膏迫英國行動的人們却也是贊助這個政策的。</p>
<p>美國於是站在接受者的方面了。它從日本接受了雙方不侵犯公約和兩國合作的獻議。這兩項，它知道只會落到縛住了美國的手，倒讓日本可以任意繼續進犯中國這一個結果的，它便默默地拒絕了。它從英國接受了友善合作的獻議，這雖然含糊，倒是懇摯的。英國正在找求着行動和同盟者。由於歐洲的局勢，它不能採取怕要釀成戰爭的行動，然而它却是可以設法鞏固中國的——這才有了李滋羅斯的調査團局勢的演變可又造成日英美各自的孤立。接近着戰爭背景的日本、一意地繼續着進展。不能單獨行使軍事手段的英國和美國，感覺到片面的道德的壓力沒有效力，却找不到合作者。兩國分明地都是站在反日的地位，然而不能採取這地位所需要的行動。</p>
<p>現在有幾種徵象顯示着；這樣的行動是會探取的。因為軍事的努力在兩强都不可能的綠故，他們必須設法使多方面的道德的或是經濟的行動發生着效力。有可能性的合作者是英國美國中國和蘇聯、這四國在受着日本的威脅的期問，都反對着日本。美國已經承認蘇聯了。蘇聯提出了多方面不侵犯公約的建議，這密切地符合着蘇聯的集體安全的槪念以及李維諾夫所下的侵略國的定義。英國呢，看明了蘇聯的和平不可分割」說的道理，威到了它那「和平政策」後面的重量，也就對蘇聯採取了更合作的態度。英國現在又復想，為它的政策，在南京尋求工具了。它希望用了在財政上鞏固南京的手段，竪起防禦日本的壁來。美國則早就對於同南京合作的可能性感到幻滅了。它所給與南京的有限的助力，雖然不能說是可以被它的銀政策所抵銷。然而美國終究担心着南京的當局由於環境的壓迫，會給在中國最强橫最活躍的那一個外國屈服的。</p>
<p>在日本侵略的威脅之下，英美對於遠東的地位和利益，是否會防禦得成功，這就全視乎對日的國際陣綫怎樣的形成。而這一層又全視乎英國和美國是否能够充分地克服了他們相互的矛盾，為遠東的合作尋出一個基礎來。這一層甚而又全視乎他們是否預備着來扶助中國的民族解放運動。沒有這一種預備，原狀是不能回復的了。因為單方面的軍事行動在英國或是美國不可能，因為單方面的「道德壓力」已經證明了沒有效力，所以遠東的情勢就憑藉着英美對於國際合作運動要進行或是要反對的决斷。否定的答案不但給與日本在中國和遠東全部任意放肆的機運。實際上，這還有着英美退出遠東的意義。這使殖民地革命的威脅性增進起來，因為革命勢力的膨脹是要成為殖民地和半殖民地國家抵抗侵略的唯一手段的。最後這就促成世界大戰的爆發了。小小的日本伸足到蘇聯的邊境，或是其他强國的任何殖民地的邊境，這是不能避免的。肯定的答案才是東方的和平與安定的唯一可能的希望（完）</p>

<h3>文化城中文化界之呼聲</h3>
<p>豐台本年「九八」事件解决後，北平由國防　前綫之地位，變而有陷人敵人陣後之虞，華南華中局勢緊張後，交涉中心，移往南京，而某方目標之所在，則依然　華北，自南京方面中日交涉入於欲斷欲續狀態以來，某方在華北之工作，乃愈益加緊，以致人心皇皇，謠言蜂起，華北人民處此情勢下，一般觀察，早料華北民衆必將有所表示，果也向為民衆先鋒之文化界，於本月十二日，有一宣言發出矣，此次宜言之由偶議，起草以至發表，其中醞釀甚久，簽名其上者，達八十三人之多，簽名時雖各人以個別名義加入，而一考彼等之所隸屬，則所有在北平之各文化機關，有大半包括在內，斯已不營北平文化界之全體，凡彼等之所表示，實亦全市民衆所欲表示而未果者，由目前情勢推測，彼等此次表示，在實際上正以極快之速度，向全市人民機續傳佈，以待事實之相常答覆，故來勢甚覺蓬勃，爰將採訪所得，記之於後。</p>
<p>（一）經過事之醞釀，在月餘以前，首先倡議者，為燕京大　方面之中國敎職員會，此秒組織，原為該校敎職員同人之聯歡組織，而且會員又大多係埋首研究之學者，過去北平各界對於時局之表示與主張，甚少見該會會員參加在內，而此次發動者之顧頡剛容庚梁士純陳其田田洪都謝玉銘謝景升雷潔環夏雲等八人，在平素尤為專門從事硏究工作，不問外事之人，此次由彼等首先發動，而又於最短期間，獲得衆多人之同情，殊值得注目，從發動至宜言之發出，其中曾開會三次，會址悉在燕京大學，彼此交換意見，獲同　之結果後，乃推張蔭麟起草宣言，幷推徐炳昶顧頡剛馮友蘭錢穆崔敬伯等加以修改，宜言前後曾修改三次，最後宣言，於本月十二日晚正式發出。</p>
<p>（二）發起人此决宜言之最大意義，不在於宣言之內容，而在於發起人所網羅之廣闊，因而足徵其代表一般民意之程度，該宣言簽名之發起人＼，截至十二日止，已有八十三人，其隸屬之文化機關，共有十二個之多，計北大方面，有陶希聖，錢穆，葉公超，張佛泉，容肇祖，朱光潛，孟森，姚從吾，唐蘭，饒毓泰，張景鉞，孫雲鑄，譚錫瑞，沈嘉瑞，崔之蘭等十五人，燕京方面，有顧頡剛，梅貽寳，洪業，陳其田，容庚，梁士純，陸侃如，蔡一諤，郭紹虞，于永滋，雷　　，田洪都，侯樹彤，謝玉銘，趙承　，夏雲，劉節，于式玉，馮家昇，謝景升，李安宅等二十一人，清華方面，有馮友蘭，張奚若，張子高，張陰麟黃子鄉，金岳霖，未自淸，薩本鐵，曾遠榮，李繼侗，楊武之，周先庚，熊迪之，陳楨等十四人，北平硏究院方面，有徐炳昶，崔敬伯，吳世昌，林志鈞等四人，回敎敎育界方面，有馬壽齡，薛文波，趙斌，艾宜栽，常松椿，王夢揚等六人，師大方面，有綫玄同，梁錦熙，齊思和，楊堃等四人，天津法商學院方面，有盧柳文，連士升，楊秀峯等三人，中國營造學社方面，有梁思成，劉敦楨等二人，平大女子文理學院方面，有嚴旣澄，董人驥，汪奠基，徐輔德，李季谷，熊樂忱等六人，天津女子師範方面，有馮沅君一人，通俗讀物編刋社方面，有黎琴南，王日蔚，李一非等三人，河北省立高級中學方面，焦實齊一人，此外屬於普通文藝界者，有楊振聲，林徽音，沈從文等三人</p>
<p>此八十三人中，如以其所硏究者分之，文科方面佔大多數，理科者亦不少，政法者毗有三數人，與通常之以政治興趣濃厚，硏究政法者佔多數之情形，適為相反，此其一，回敎徒與漢人合作者，在北平不常見，此次參加宣言簽名之回敎六人，均為北平加教中之重要人物，此其一，向來北平教育界文化界之對外作集團表示時，其中無不以負有敎育行政責任者為主幹，而此次則一反向例，此其三，上述三點，皆此决宣言發起人方面之特色。</p>
<p>（三）反響宜言發表後，此間一般人士，均取熱烈之贊助態度，現發起人等正在繼續徵求簽名，參加者頗為踴躍，聞俟簽滿相當數目時，（五千或五萬人未定，卽用合法手續，遞呈中央，以　示　　之公意。</p>

<h3>王彬彥刑訴　盧興原案訊結　定廿三日宣判</h3>

<p>事實封查　一面並委任盧興原律師代表向新報登載啟事、詳述該項押欸糾葛之經過、王閱後認其啟事中之措詞、有破壞彼之信譽之處、且使政府迄不將彼所墊之欸　十　萬八千六百餘元給還、因延律師向第一特區地方法院對廣東銀行經理張榮溥及律師盧興原、提起妨害信譽之刑事　訴、並附帶民訴、請求</p>
<p>賠償墊款　二千萬八千六百餘元外、並賠償彼個人損失每年五千元計十年、共五萬元、業已一度傳審、被告祗盧興原到案、對王提起反訴、請治以誣告之罪、諭候傳王　張到庭再訊各情、已誌前報、昨日下午、由戴榮鐸推事繼續開庭傳審、原被兩造均各投案、張榮溥亦對王彬彥提起誣告之反訴、庭上先向王彬彥訊據供稱、抵押房產被廣東銀行聲請法院執行時、我</p>
<p>並未抵抗　乃發封三日之後、盧興原　代表該行登報、指欸項並非維持地方之用、謂別有作用、係屬影射、致使我信用大受損失、凡能幫我之忙者、現在對我都不甚信任、被告既謂係屬影射、應請命其提出證據、啟事雖由廣東銀行署名、張榮溥乃該行經理、自應負責云云、質之被告張榮溥供稱、廣東銀行、以去年九月四日繼香港總行停業、我以是月十一日退職、此後該行一切由英國</p>
<p>駐滬法院　委任瑞納管理、故登載啟事、我初不知、至王當年之押欸、則係與我接洽、但未問起用途、現自八月十五日起、該行一切資產、仍委由我保管、並着手籌備復業等語、盧興原供稱、該項借欸、成於十三年、而王棟代表保衛團與江蘇軍事善後督辦韓國鈞所訂立善後墊欸契約則為十四年之事、況王向銀行借欸時、係用其</p>
<p>個人名義　更未題及欸屬公用、故最高法院判決書未承認借欸係用於維持地方者、乃執行之際、竟有團體出面干涉、是以該行西人端納授意我擬稿登報、故登報之動機、在希望外界不妨碍法院之執行與該行之債權而已、啟事措詞</p>
<p>甚為空泛　並未肯定原告影射、文義至為明顯·不了原告頭腦不清、而其代理人之頭腦亦復不清、廣東銀行所以倒閉、皆因欠債者不還、詎原告反要求賠償損失、論理彼應賠償該行損失云云、原告繼復將其歷次戰事在閘北維持之苦心、陳述一過、後由原告之律師與被告次第辯論之下、戴推事諭候本月二十三日下午宣判、</p>

<h3>疋頭　廠布一再狂漲　大有邁無止境之槪</h3>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼俏、旋又回鬆之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥回小一角零、坎拿大小四角左右、故開價時、人心曾稍平靜、較之前日收價、回跌一分半左右、惟自二盤以下、因業外仍有吸進、市氣又俏、各月份喊價、又逐步升提、較初盤逐回漲一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、因麥市之漲風甚劇、人心會又引起、較上午續好一分左右、旋則大戶多頭脫手、一部分浮多亦隨之出籠、人心比較鬆軟、較初開時回落一二分、據業中人之推測、欲求市面平穩、一方須尋求原料之供給、一方必須嚴禁輸出、人心始能逐漸和緩云、</p>

<h3>和平的革命</h3>
<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>我國具有二千餘年歷史的專制政治，終於在二十五前給推翻了。但是和專制政治，同樣地有悠久歷史的婦女被壓迫吏，到幾時，才能終止呢？</p>
<p>據一般的說來，我國的婦女，似乎已和淸李與民國初期，不可同日而語了。例如業已爭得了繼承權，敎育也得到了平等權，選舉權與被選舉權，也有了，女子的婚姻權，也爭得了自主了，在職業界中，女子也可以服務了。這些，自然不能不說是女子已掙脫了牢鎖，已像二十五年前先烈們推翻淸室的統治，而抬頭了。但是，我以為，這還不過是解放其名，在實際上，婦女們還需要來一次解放運動的大革命，爭取眞正的自由，與平等的地位。</p>
<p>「不為奴隸」，這是婦女解放運動的口號。現在在形式上，被解放了的婦女，更須充實不為奴隸的精神。要不為奴隸的幾個先决條件，是該在這裏，先行一提的。——（一）須多讀書，以廣學識。（二）須習得一種職業技能，俾得自食其力。（三）不塗附抹粉，以减少外界的誘力。（四）不貪小便宜，以避免卑劣的引誘。</p>
<p>上述四項，是割斷着男性以女性為玩物為目的的導火綫。而同時，對於以掠奪餛女的肉體與精神的男子，處於敵對地位的婦女羣衆，還該造起一個進可以取，退可以守的堅强堡壘來，以資自衛。這個堅强的堡壘，是該由婦女們自己起來構築的。——是一個大規模的婦女組織，以職業與經濟為中心，而以其他一切有關於婦女的問題為附。茲試略舉其應努力的工作若干條如下。（一）提倡正當的婦女職業。（二）介紹職業。（三）　婦女們在職業界中，闢新生路。（四）提倡，鼓勵，或强迫儲蓄。（五）救濟失業婦女。（六）為婦女謀法律的保障。（七）為婚姻問題的顧問。（八）改進職業婦女的生活。（九）保障職業婦女的健康。（十）提倡職業婦女在業餘為社會服務。（十一）監視職業婦女的意志薄弱的行為，並加以正，當的指導。</p>
<p>若是我國的婦女界眞能有着　麼一個健全的組織，那麼我國職業婦女的地位，準能因之而提高不少。現在一般的桃色案件的發生，大致總不外下述的幾點。（一）因失業恐慌或經濟困難，而被利誘。（二）因年輕，或意志薄弱，少經世故而被誘。（三）因缺乏對於男性的認識，或不諳戀愛的經騐，而演成多角戀愛。（四）因業餘無正當娛樂，或消遺法，而誤人岐途。——這幾個問題，若是一般的婦女，在一個健全的婦女組織的保障之下，再加着不為奴隸的四。先决條件的自省，雖然一般的男性們，處處為婦女設下着陷阱，在幹着玩弄女性，或以女性為俘虜的工作，女性是能到處履險如夷，而高視闊步地前進，向前途爭得眞正的自由與平等。</p>
<p>這是不用流血的革命的一法，正如辛亥革命的不流血一樣。不過這種和平的革命，不能少的是：（一）堅強的意志。鎮靜的態度。（三）嚴密的組織。（四）強固而繼續不衰的毅力。（五）光明的手段。（六）萬眾一心的精神。辛亥革命的成功，是具有着這些，婦女要從形勢的解放，而更爭得完全的解放，也是該這樣努力的。</p>
<h3>西班牙婦女　戰地服務精神的奮勇</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>西班牙在內戰聲中，最値得我們注意的一件事情，便是婦女界在戰地的服務精神，我們在若干小說之中，讀到古時歐洲各國女軍人的驚人事蹟，而這種事件，今日在西班牙這個邦國之中，又再度實現了。在西班牙，這一次加入人民陣線的婦女，反抗法西斯叛軍，在戰地上面已有驚人的成績，伊們都全身武裝手裏拿了來福槍，盒子砲跋涉長途，經過不少崎嶇的山道，到達瑪德里，為首都扭任防衛的工作，抵抗叛軍的進攻，兇猛得和雌老虎一樣。凡是效忠政府的城市，街道之中，到處有女軍人的巡邏，縱持地方秩序，救護前綫傷兵，工作的緊張，得未曾有。西班牙婦女的如此勇敢，頓使我們追懷到古書上一班中幗英雄的偉蹟。</p>
<p>在西班牙的參戰婦女之中，最値得我們注意的一個是拉拍希尼亞。伊在瑪德里地一向參加軍部的工作，在西班牙的工人看來，伊好像是個工人的基督，而遠在十年之前，伊早已從事於政治工作了。這一次自戰事發生以後，伊率領了大批勞工婦女出發到前綫去，親自發槍射擊，而伊所率領的軍人，至少可抵政府軍全力的十分之一。伊的眞名字呌桃樂珊伊伯利，老早就參加革命工作為共產黨的代表，在民衆方面更為了伊的面貌美麗，搜長演說和熱情之故，有人替伊題過一個「熱情之花」的雅號。</p>
<p>伊今年四十一歲，看去好像是個法蘭西的女革命家，面孔很憔悴、就是混在伊的敵人之中，也很可看出伊是一個西班牙的美婦人。最初伊蓄意要研究敎育，預備日後常女敎師，但那時伊除了功課之外，更分出一部分時間去硏究馬克斯，恩格爾，列寗等諸家的的說。後來伊非常貧困，曾在一個煤礦區中的小鎮市做過衣婦人，結果伊在這礦區中，就參加過各種活動。在西班牙，首相里佛拉獨裁時，伊和伊的丈夫都曾被捕而人獄，一九三四年二月，社會主義革命的一回，伊們在奧斯德里的住宅完全被燬，結果就到蘇聯去小住。去年冬季，第三國際舉行第七次大會時，伊被選為執行委員之一，所以更是聞名於世界了。伊的勇敢為任何人所知道的，西班牙在去年二月，革命的時候，伊曾越過一次獄，那時保衛團和衛隊依舊還服從前政府，對於罪犯，不准其家屬或親友在鐵柵外探望。為了有人要打開牢獄的鐵門，守監獄的人舉起了槍恐嚇罪犯，誰想出去，就要送命。為了得不到當地長官的合作，拉拍希尼亞便突然爬到鐵柵上面，阻止守監人的發槍，一面招呼全個監獄的罪犯逃出去。在法蘭西邊境的一班觀察家，包括西班牙的難民都知道伊對於共產主義不是十分深信，伊祗知道為政府軍效勞，攻打法西斯叛軍。假如西班牙內戰結果，政府軍獲得最後勝利的話，那麼新內閣之中，恐怕少不了這個中幗英雄的。</p>
<h3>軍隊和婦女</h3>
<p>— 一髪</p>
<p>英雄美人自古以來便造成了許多可歌可泣的故事，幾疑兩者是不能分離的配偶。軍隊中好像不應該有女子存在着的，但是事實上軍隊中是很需要女子的。我國古時有以為女子參加戰爭是不吉利的，認為是帶着邪術詭計的色彩，而古代有名女將却較歐美為多　國民軍北伐時女同志們也不過担任政治工作為多，握着槍桿正式參戰的較少。俄國的工業政策實行之後，證明婦女的勞働實力，並不輸於男子。這决西班牙內亂結果，又可以證明女子　參戰的戰鬥力，又不弱於男子。因為这次有許多女子毫無訓練的，也可以衝上前綫，學着人家作戰。因此許多軍事家都覺得國內女子有同樣的受軍事訓練的必要。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞軍隊後面也有女子的，她們只要聽得了槍砲聲，和目睹着炸彈爆發的慘狀。她們便不顧自己的子女，以及丈夫的財產，向山林裏亂逃，和西班牙的女子，眞有天壤之別了。這是敎育程度，以及平日所受訓練不同的結果。我國的女子，旣未受過怎樣的訓練，又無阿國女子强健體格。若閉目默想，假定戰禍爆發，我國的女子，不但不能處理後方的事情，還要依賴着男子保護避難，决不會能和阿國女子一樣的自動逃避着。常有因了一個女子偵得了秘密，或是洩露了軍情，而使整千整萬的軍隊落入陷阱，數百方里的國土，因此喪失，這是常有的事情。因此女子常活躍在軍隊的裏面，作重要的閒諜。就是並不正式深入軍隊之中，退居後方，也很能為前綫軍隊臂助的。傷兵的看護，工商業的維持，那是已成為後方婦女們應盡的責任。歐戰時候，識字的女子，常替着老婦幼子代寫着家信，給前綫的征人，報吿家中情形，使安心作戰。兵士身上的女子照片，那是不知有多少。人類在最殘酷的戰爭中，還是忘不了兒女之情的。因此女子能使男子奮勇殺敵成為烈士，也能使男子成為奴顏婢膝的亡國奴。</p>
<p>日本的女子，絕對不會嫌惡她們的軍隊，雖然也知道戰爭是不人道的。但是為了盡女子責任起見，時常作慰勞軍隊等工作，以鼓勵前綫的兵士，一方面努力學習後方一切凖備。裝載滿輪的烟草慰問袋等，和軍火一樣的開向滿洲和華北來了。我國婦女界在此種國難情形之下，决非少塗些胭脂，多買些國貨就算完事，應當更進一步，作積極的訓練和準備才是。</p>
<h3>婦女與化妝品</h3>
<p>— 白夏</p>
<p>專門在服裝上弄花樣的婦女，我們是感到厭惡的；不過，我們也並不是呌婦女們全要蓬首垢面。不，我們不反對婦女們研究服裝應該怎樣裁剪才適體，才合衛生；因為有研究，然後服裝才有進步。人是永遠在進步的途上的，只要不把時間與精力浪費掉，只要能够好好兒利用時間與精力，沒有什麼事不好做，也沒有什麼已做了的事是不帮助進步的。</p>
<p>在化裝上也是一樣。俗語說得好：「三分人才，七分打扮。」人如果不留意儀容上的美整，不但人會厭惡你，而你自己在心理等各方面也沒有什麼益處。比如說：堆積在我們皮膚上的塵垢，我們需要除去它嗎？當然，這是需要的！所以，常我們除去這些塵垢之後，不但面容美麗，而且對體內排洩出來的汗液也給它留下一個出路。除塵垢用的是肥皂，其外的香水雪花膏牙粉牙膏等，大部分也是人人必需之品。不過，話還應該說轉來：如果用的不得當，就是說過於浪費時，這也是不對的：並且，我們要用也應該用國貨，國貨正不缺少好的香水雪花膏牙粉牙膏。但是，而今一般崇尙摩登的婦女們，却以為洋貨好，國貨不好，於是這也用的洋貨，那也用的洋貨。這不是空口說白話，這是有憑有據的。試看本月五日上海各報，就有這樣的一個大標題：</p>
<p>「脂粉香水化裝品進口有增無减一。</p>
<p>一脂粉香水……進口驚人！」</p>
<p>這新聞的內容吿訴我們說：「茲據國際貿易局統計處調査報吿，今年八個月全國脂粉香水輸入，計値國幣四十四萬二千四百〇三元，牙粉牙膏輸入，値二十六萬四千六百二十七元，雪花粉膏輸入，値十八萬三千六百〇八元，總計三項化裝品進口總數，達國幣九十餘萬元，允以脂粉香水一項，較去年同期增加三萬餘元。」</p>
<p>好，把新聞抄完之後，我也不想多說了，只請賢明的婦女們想一想，我們是不是犯得着在化裝品上流出這九十餘萬元的白銀？</p>
<h3>皖南婦女</h3>
<p>— 舍利</p>
<p>在一些城市及鄉村裏，都流行着這樣的歌曲：日頭起山一點黃，養個阿囡揀個郞；只顧銀兩多多接，不顧白髮老新郞！　　因為風氣閉塞的緣故，新思想在皖南是打了敗仗了，皖南還是盛行着舊婚姻制。自由戀愛，是要被人瞧做怪誕和敗壞風化的，「父母之命，媒妁之言」，還是姑娘們的「終身大事」的主宰者。做爹媽的，總喜歡把女兒嫁「塡房」。人老點。懂得艱難，尤其懂得怎樣巴結丈人丈母，不比年靑人浮蕩，愛風流，立不住脚跟，保不牢家業的，這是一般父母要把女兒嫁做「塡房」的原因。</p>
<p>當然還有別的原因：女兒太小了，平時又是嬌生慣養的，不懂事，為了怕嫁過去要受公婆的委屈，倒不如嫁個年老的，沒有公婆，一老一少兩口兒安安逸逸過日子，做爸媽的也算對得住女兒。</p>
<p>雖然女婿的年齡是適宜於做女兒的伯伯的，女兒願意不願意？這是女兒的事，和丈人丈母不相干。</p>
<p>這些做「塡房」的婦女們，大都是一過門就當家，除了服侍老丈夫，和驅使奴婢（你知道！頭在皖南的中等家庭中還是常見的）之外，其餘的功課，就是繡繡花，做雙把鞋送入情：有綫的也時常义個八圈，或者呌了鄰舍來挖花。</p>
<p>生活固是悠閒，但有時瞧見白了頭髮的丈夫，眉梢忍不住挑起了幽愁，縱然性的渴望使得人苦惱，然而丈夫不幸死了，也還只有守節一條路！因為貞操還是皖南婦女的瓌寳呢！</p>
<h3>一個女學警的自白</h3>
<p>— 石瓊</p>
<p>自從我認識了書本上的故事，我便羨慕「木蘭從軍。」然而中國，却只有男子的軍隊，沒有婦女的軍隊。各處的軍官學校，只收男子，不收女子。我欲從軍，苦於無門可入；又加家庭的反對，更使我得不到獨行其志的機會。</p>
<p>中學畢了業，生活逼著我走上小學敎師之路。兩年多的白粉筆，紅墨水，看厭了我的眼睛，嘶破了我的喉嚨；向來自許為中幗丈夫的一段心事，屈抑得無可伸訴。我終於拋棄了敎鞭，不請於父母，不謀於姊妹，投上了招考女子學警之門。</p>
<p>「警」，雖不是軍」，但在非常時期，也是「執干戈以衛社稷」的一分子。料想可無背於我的始願。</p>
<p>現在，我是一個「學警」了；脫去了累贅的旗袍，穿上了輕快的武裝；抽去了光鮮的絲襪，裏上了緊縛的幫帶；剪短了油膩的烏絲，戴上了平頂的軍帽；拋去了針錢，提起了槍桿；雄糾糾，氣昻昻，誰能看出我們是個女子呢？有時好奇的男女們圍集到我們的操塲上看，「啊！誰說是女學警呀，這不是和男子們一樣麼？」這些驚訝的談論，時時從我們耳邊吹過。</p>
<p>天還沒有大亮，聽到一聲軍號，我們便起來操練。白天的時間，一半上講堂，一半上操塲。我們的生活，是完全軍隊化的；飲食起居，都是規律的，刻苦的，一些沒有假借。黃浦江起伏的波浪，</p>
<p>象徵着我們的心絃；西砲台砰砰拍拍打槍把的聲音，加强了我們的膽氣。不久的將來，我們便是維護治安的警察的一份子，也就是守衛國土的軍人的一份子啊！有些姊妹們根本看不起當個女警察，我呢，抱定宗旨，只要自身經濟能够獨立，不做社會上的寄生蟲；能有一點點效用於國家民族，比沉醉在歌樓酒榭的妖姬如何？比花枝招展，出賣靈魂的舞女如何？比供富豪貴人玩弄的妾媵如何？</p>
<p>啊！東海裏的怪鯨魚，昻首翻騰，要一口吞下大陸上訓善的羔羊：鮮美的草地上，盤踞着橫行無忌的毒蟒。這個世界，還容得我們婦女界搔首弄姿，誇奇鬥豔，享受閨中淸福嗎？</p>
<p>我敬以至誠請願於覺醒的女同胞們！拭去你口上的脂，洗去你臉上的粉，顯出你强健活潑的天眞而目。</p>
<p>時髦的女同胞們！脫去你的臂圈，勒下你的金鑽，改換你的奇裝豔服。省下你們奢侈的消耗，為民族多備一粒子彈；騰出你們遊樂的時間，替我們多縫件短衫</p>
<p>倘不願男為人臣，女為人妾，就從這時候起，二萬萬女同胞，一齊向著這民族自救的大路出發。</p>
<h3>嬰兒病的處置方法</h3>
<p>— 佩佩女士</p>
<p>初生的嬰兒，因內部的抵抗力弱，所以很容易患病。到那時，做父母的要是一無醫學的知識，那便要手足無措，胡亂處置了。所以嬰兒病的處置方法，做父母的實在是不可不知的常識。</p>
<p>一臍炎臍帶在生後的五天到七天的光景，便要脫落，不久自愈，留下一個臍窩。假使在結瘢之前，不小心縛了不潔的布，或受到別的汚穢的東西，那臍部就會發赤腫脹，及至後來也會釀膿，身體發熟。這時候，應卽刻川淸潔的布漬了冷硼酸水　在上面，使他安靜地平臥，每日換布一次，這樣經過三四天，便能痊愈。（未完）</p>

<p>— 賢影</p>

<p>很感謝那被訪問的五位小姐，承她們化費幾個鐘頭，忍心地答覆我所請問，在此地表示無限欣慰。（完）</p>
<h3>下意識者（上）</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>世界上的一切事情，往往總是很矛盾的，一個頭腦極清楚，識見極遠到，日曾受過高等教育的人，有時候也會干出幾件很討麻煩的事情來；甚至在幹的過程中自己還是很明白，知道這件事是幹不得的，於人於己都是有害而無益的，但結果依舊又幹了下去，祇能無狡辯地領受人們的咀咒：「下意識者」！</p>
<p>人是有向上性的，意識往下沉，簡直是開倒車，看來好像是不會有的事；但在實際上，却是常有的事，最近且又臨到了平素常以剛毅見稱的青年雕刻家劉一帆的頭上。</p>
<p>一帆是一個以藝術為生命的青年，他在國內學了幾年西洋畫之後，便到意大利去足足消磨了四年工夫，專心研習雕刻方面的藝術；他對於雕刻以外的一切，簡直忽略到了不可再忽略的地步，譬如穿衣服，他在意大利四年，從不曾添一件新的，襯衫破得成了鏤空的條紋，他也會照舊套上去，吃飯呢，一天不吃是不希罕的，一吃五次，六次，也是往往有的。這些都還不稀罕，因為有許多藝術家，儘有特地如此表演着的，而且他們都有一的主張，就是「藝術不忘戀愛，戀愛不忘藝術」；所以藝術家和異性間的周旋，往往總比普通人忙一些。然而劉一帆却並不如此，曾經有人問過他，那位和他住在一起的怪美麗的中國女學生究竟是那一省的人，他也回答不出來，因為他的整個的心靈已給「曲綫」「石膏」「模型」等…所佔據盡了，再沒有席餘地可以容留其他的東西了。</p>
<p>回國之後，許多跟他與着同樣或相類的功課的人總免不掉要在學堂裏兼些課，先打出一　地位來，或是來一次個人作品展覽會，先鬧些空名氣出來；但一帆却不願如此，他覺得這樣是不容易再使自己的藝術有什麼進步的，同時也虧他老子有綫，就讓也獨自組織了一所小規模的雕塑工程公司」，一面自己繼續研究，一面稍稍承攬一些銅像或浮雕一類的工程。</p>
<p>他回國後的第三年，有許多戚友都在紛紛地議論着，為什么大家全不會瞧見過劉一帆，大概是雕塑公司的生意太好了，所以忙得人影也不見；但有及格根他父親常來往的人就會給他代替否認，說他生活非常苦，全靠老子接濟，所以到了二十九歲還不曾　過女人的念頭咧。</p>

<p>第五十號，蓬萊路一一十七號李遼敬君問：敝人兩年十八歲，因意志不强，在一月餘前，被鄰居蕩婦所誘，失身於彼。不料一二日後，小便刺痛，繼則流出黃色膿汁。當時痛苦，悔悵萬分。在數日後請醫診治。經注射血淸（？）四針，及尿道沖洗數次，數日後膿汁遂漸减少，漸至沒有。但當時服醫所開藥外，同時敝人又服『山得』爾彌地」二瓶。請問（一）在當時首先幾次冲洗尿道後，回家時小便痛極不出，坐息若干時後方能小便，是何原因？（二）現在晨起時尿道口並無封口，小便亦無痛，惟陰莖舉時，內覺隱痛，包皮左略腫。（三）有時陰毛根部有些痛。（四）有時會陰處覺有些痛。</p>
<p>答：（一）用强烈藥品沖洗常有此症狀，同時須注意有無『尿道狹窄』。（二）為病未全愈之現像。（三）『淋病』此症狀，但須注意有無此部皮膚病。（四）有『前列腺炎』，『精囊炎』之疑。</p>
<p>是否梅毒</p>
<p>第五十一號，法租界賴格納路　福里二十二號×××君問：十四五年前一因房事不愼而同精。初無所苦，决年一三月覺頭痛，胸前發出類似粉屑之物一，覺癢。中醫生檢查，兩手關節炎竟各有一核；云是梅毒，打六〇六一針即愈。惟兩手關節之核仍未散，次年再山他醫師打白色針一打，核仍未散。至今已有十餘年，尚無所苦。前年春間因覺頭暈，無力，驗血無毒。去年亦然，騐血無毒。本年秋後，又覺頭暈無力，飯食亦减。鄙人因確未與他女交垢，不知其為何病也。茲敬問（一）回精有毒否？（二）是否梅毒？（三）兩手之核現在可能消散否？（四）用藥抑打針？（五）梅毒隔十餘年復發吾？（六）第二三期梅毒症狀如何？</p>
<p>答：（一）無此說。（二）有「梅毒」嫌疑，有無他病不能定，騐血呈陰性不足為無毒之徵，一百人之『梅毒』患者有二三人血中不能騐出。（三）如係『梅毒』，可以消散。（四）診後再定。（五）能。（六）薔薇疹，丘疹，橡皮腫，骨痛，其他症狀尙多，不及一一記之。且以上症狀亦非必發症狀，或有此而缺彼，或有彼而缺此。此所以『梅毒』不易診也。</p>
<p>關於血壓</p>
<p>第五十二號北平宜外爛縵胡同九閒房八號諸雪　君間：舍第於日前投考某處，檢查體格時，據云『血壓過高』。當時因受檢查者人數頗多，故未便向該醫師詢問治療之法。茲不揣冒昧，作下列數問，敬請先生賜答，並予指示為感：（一）血壓過高有何種危險？（一）該症之起因？（三）應如何使血壓减低，有自療之法否？（四）平日宜忌何種食物？（舍弟素無煙酒之嗜好（五）血壓過高時對身體各部會起變化吾？頭暈，喉痛，以及嘴唇破裂是否因血壓過高而起之變化？（六）舍弟現年尚輕，設目前不治，則血壓會繼續增高否？將來是否會成難治之痛？</p>
<p>答：（一）在一四〇種以下無危險（平常人一二〇左右），高至一四〇以上者能起頭痛，暈眩，知覺異常，麻痺，側盲，弱視，腦溢血等，頗危險。（二）有自發性，續發性之別，自　性者因肉食，用腦過度，遺傳而來；續發性由鉛中毒，疝痛，梅毒，脾臟病，動脈硬化，萎縮腎而來。總之，這是一個症狀不是一個病，原因，症狀，預後都有種種，一能持一而論。（三）先診其起因，施原因療法。不能得其原因者，則服『安度沃碘』（Endojodin），注射『砂利脈』（Silimon）。食物中少喫肉，號，多喫蔬菜，水果，並喫常瀉藥。（四）見（三）。（五）見（一），頭暈即因此而起，但喉痛，嘴唇破裂則另有其原因，與此病無關。（六）年齡越大，血壓越高，將來本症狀的本病雖不能成為不治之症，但由此引起之病，則治之頗難。</p>
<p>肺臓梅毒</p>
<p>第五十三號，兆豐路二八八號，周盛相君問：有一人患三梅毒至重，然又不便就醫，心想專心服藥自療，未知服何藥始克漸漸戰勝病魔。因其人昔曾患『腦梅毒』，注肘Jodisan約四十針而愈。時隔五六載，忽患咯血，氣喘，如『肺結核』；但症狀終不若結核之勵害也。後乃知係梅毒作崇！因經濟困難，仰祈大醫師詳開數藥，以作自療，務殺微菌！（下略）</p>
<p>答：『肺梅毒』頗危險，不治生命可慮。內服藥雖有『碘化鉀』（Potasb　lodide），但其效不着；服之不當，危險孔多。故為貴友計，不宜視生命如兒戲，而咎惜一二十元之注射費。注射『阿斯凡納命』（六〇六），五六針可以漸愈，每針不過三元。忠吿如此，他所不敢聞命。至於經濟困難，此乃社會舉範圍，不在醫學範圍之內。</p>
<p>關於淋病</p>
<p>第五十四號福建路新昌一六二號李文輝君問：我於一週前和一妓女性交，四五天後就發生急性淋病。今請問；（一）急性淋病有否斷根希望？要多少天！（二）僅用注射及內服藥而不用電療能根治否？（三）流白濁宜制止否？（四）淋病固宜休息，但因生活關係又不可能，則至少須多少天始能出外工作？（五）又包皮上有一破損小塊，是否下疳？若非下疳能吾打關於下疳的針預防之？此破塊宜用何藥粉外敷？（六）發生淋病後第四日起，那陰莖和陰囊的連接處有一根筋頗覺痛疼，就好像當陽具勃起時用手重力壓下一般，以坐着為最，立着亦略感到，而臥下則全不覺得。此現象是否睪丸發炎？或其他變化——『神經痛』抑疲勞現象？</p>
<p>答：（一）能治愈，加緊治療三星期至二月可愈。（二）注射藥最重要，內服藥次之，十日後須洗滌。電療在學理上本　　大　據。（三））當然宜制止。（四）最少安臥二十日，至痛疼，發熱之現象全消失為止。（五）『下疳』發硬，但有破損不能卽據以斷為下疳。『硬性下疳』注射『尅爾梅星』（Carbisin）可以預防，軟性不能預防破塊可用『碘仿』（lodoform）乾撤。（六）頗有『睪丸炎』之可能，但隔二日猶不見睪丸發腫則不是。『淋梅性前尿道炎』亦有此症狀。</p>
<p>淋病愈否</p>
<p>第五十五號，（發信人姓名住址保守秘密）問：本年一月間因劣友誘往宿娟，致染白濁，由龜頭流出。越四日即注射『果能克淋』（Gonacrindin）二盒，及服『山得兄彌地』二瓶，同時並施行洗滌（非電療）。十天以後，似已稍愈，紙晨起時略有少許。而尿中之溷濁頗多。自知病未　斷，乃續服雙料『樂的能』三盒，『半地丸』二盒，繼續洗滌亦有二三僩月之久，但現在尿中之濁絮仍有。（一）依上叙，是否病未絕根，抑是病後之應有現象？（二）如須繼續治療應用何　？（三）能房事否？（四）生殖器若舉起時，若經人接觸，（不是房事）即有精液排出，是否早洩？對身體有危險吾（五）如醫此病應用何法？</p>
<p>答：（一）尿中溷濁不一定是病未絕根，應先送尿檢查，視其溷濁成份為何物，是蛋白，是尿酸鹽，是上皮細胞，是脂脂，抑是膿及雙球菌。（二）如檢查結果為膿及雙球菌，是為『慢性淋病』，可不必再注射，但內服『果能尅淋片』（Tab－Sinoacrindin）並用『蛋白銀』加『佛卡因』Argent　Protein　1%　and　Procain溫至三十七度，每日洗射二次卽可。（三）檢查尿中無膿及雙球菌可行房事。（四）不是早洩，是尿道漏！一種淋病的後遺症—無害，其中無精蟲，只有少許上皮，陰莖仍能勃起。（五）本病無害，不治療亦無關，强治之，反能惹起他病。一定要治，可用『硝酸銀液』點滴。</p>
<p>注射（Poligon）（百淋恐）五萬細菌一針而後檢尿，格外可靠。</p>
<p>頭痛</p>
<p>第五十六號，高昌廟柯田君問：（一）敝人頭痛時痛時止，在勞動後加甚，是否有可靠療法。（二）痛在一側是是何緣故？</p>
<p>答：（一）服『痛必靈』（lonbelin）每决兩片，痛時服，在服藥前須診斷是否有其他疾病。（二）此名『偏頭痛』，是精神病之一種。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>女與男</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>據報載，匃牙利首都有一位蘭瓊小姐，數月前經某名醫施行手術，已由溫柔窈窕之淑女，一變而為雄糾糾的丈夫。那位小姐之所以要「施行手術」者，則是「以為搖身一變而為男子，卽可享受男子之權利與幸福」。</p>
<p>要「搖身一變而為男子」，當然是因為羡慕「男子之權利與幸福」的緣故。但所謂「男子之權利與幸福」究竟有什麼可羨慕的呢？曰：「以為此後可以就職業，（選就男子之職業），擁嬌妻，享受男性之一切權利也」。</p>
<p>僅僅以「可以選就男子之職業」，以及擁嬌妻」來作答案，那自然還嫌太抽象了些，但就此我們也可以想見「男子之職業」的「幸福」，以及作「嬌妻」的苦楚，要不然，我想那位蘭瓊小姐卽使不彷徨無路「如喪家之犬」，也不會化數月的工夫來「施行手術」的。</p>
<p>匈牙利的國情我不大淸楚，以意度之，他們那邊的女子職業當不致如我國女子除按麼，嚮導，舞女之外便很少女子職業吧？但卽使發達了，和男子比起來，大概還相差一大段，所以蘭瓊小姐便不惜「施行手術」的想「由女性轉為男性」，以「享受男子之權利與幸福」。</p>
<p>除了從事職業之外，女性的另一條條路便祗有做「男性」的「嬌妻」。做「男性」的「嬌妻」，據希特勒先生說起來雖然這是「女子最好的職業」，而我們的少奶奶們，也的確有甚多在「養兒子」之外過着吃喝玩樂的生活，「安份守己」的度着她們「最好的職業」的，但那些祗是少許寄生蟲的生活，「舊約」的「創世記」上也明明白白的吿訴我們說：「神又對女人設，……你丈夫必管轄你」，可見「嬌妻」也並不怎樣好做，第一便得受丈夫的「管轄」。</p>
<p>蘭瓊小姐大概也是不願做「養育機器」的「嬌妻」的一個，但「嬌妻」旣不願做，女子職業又沒有像「男子之職業」那般「幸福」，（至於「失業」，原是男女一律，或者可說是女甚於男的。）於是「搖身一變而為男子」，「享受男性之一切權利」，原是人情之常，而化上幾個月的工夫來「施行手術」，自然也在所不計了。</p>
<p>但想不到的却是「變」了之後的到處碰壁，他的「對手」均謂「女有女之生活，應滿足現狀，且同時各工廠互相密約，不雇傭由女變男之人」，於是使她「益如喪家之犬，無處棲身」到最後不得不「微露悔意」，以為「何必多此一舉」。</p>
<p>那位蘭瓊小姐的懊悔「多此一舉」，大概是由於變性之後「仍不以男子待我」。這倒的確是「何必多此一舉」。倍倍爾在他的醫著「婦人與社會」第一章中就說：「婦人和工人的地位，有許多類似的地方，但婦人有一件事，却先於工人？就是他們是最先做隸的人類！「奴隸」這種人未曾存在之前，婦人已經是奴隸了」。又說：「一切社會的從屬和壓迫，是起因於被壓迫者對壓迫者的經濟的從屬。婦人已久處這種經濟從屬的地位。這是人類社會進化的歷史給我門的教訓。」。</p>
<p>所以，蘭瓊小姐郎使於性的方面由女變了男，而且，順利地「享受男性之一切權利」，但要是「經濟的從屬」問題沒解决，他的努力還是白費。</p>
<p>因為：「被壓迫是婦人和工人共同的運命」。</p>

<h3>在新加坡植物園</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>因為搬房子，翻讀五年前的日記。覺得一驚：多麼可笑的少年人的「天真」呢？現在正逢失業，煩悶是和五年前一樣；可是世界教給我另一種看法了。抄出來警誡自己，免得再墮於「虛無」，並且以第三人的態度，展示出來算做苦悶的知識份子之一型。解剖自己和解剖社會，想來對於掙扎着的今天，都有好處吧？</p>
<p>是星期日了，天氣陰沉得很，成天的天空全被灰色的雲所籠罩，都市沉鬱着了，心情像墮入黑暗的無底的深淵。懷念着故國的深秋，那落葉應該鋪滿地上吧？像東奔西散的少年伴侶一樣。</p>
<p>偶然想到植物園去，便懶懶地踱出中街，走過海濱。海被灰色的雲所蓋罩，那面止上的　紋活像老人的面孔，既無聲息，也没有吼聲，像暮氣沉沉的垂死老人一樣。從新加坡河出口突出海的崅上，我坐上了公共汽車，便向郊外進發去了。</p>
<p>車駛過了島上的　　地帶，柏油道蜿蜒交叉。車子是冷落了，别墅式的洋房錯落地擺在小　　上面。熱帶的紅花滿佈在道旁，别墅周圍的花草在陰沈沈的天氣下都覺萎靡地無生氣，全失了赤道植物原有的活氣景象。太陽光掩没了，新加坡不應該也掩没了。牠的　　的鬧聲吧？</p>
<p>在植物園的門口停了車子，從寂寥的車廂裏爬下來，一個人寂寞地鑽入了那植物園的大門。一道小柏油路在我的眼前展開，前面是四面紛歧的小小草徑。棕梠樹披開了它的傘狀的樹葉，許多針葉形的植物突起了高高的瘦幹。大榕樹在地面佔領着廣大的面積，它的垂垂的灰黑色　子深埋在地下：棷　卻聳起它的崛强的樹梢，預備高攀天空。弱小的植物在地下軟弱地蔓生，或在玻璃房子裏伸長着它的長長而低垂的草葉狀葉子。檳榔樹從它的黄白色的花球裏噴出了香氣，透過鳥聲，那香氣有點像故鄉的桂花香味。</p>
<p>星期日下午的植物園從來没有這麼地冷寂，看那紛歧的花徑寂無行人。天氣是陰沉得令人想起故國深秋的日子，廣大的樹　被微風吹動，發出悽悽的冷氣。</p>
<p>從那備遊人飲食的茶棚子外面穿過，寂寞的桌椅披上白中，發出冷光。棚子裏空無隻影，想起今天遊園的人物是多麼稀少。裏着一套涼透的白色衣服，我孤独地從樹　間穿到一個頗為荒涼的池邊。面着池子的靠背椅上坐下，一隻小鳥被嚇着飛走了，掠着水面從水生植物的葉面上飛過，然後穿過草　，消失於遠方。草　被微風吹得　　作響。</p>
<p>自己沈入幻想裏面。心中空洞得很是茫然，卻也紛亂得茫無頭緒。讓回憶在心中咬嚙，少年人的故事在腦筋中滾轉。每個每個的思想都把握不信：才在腦中飛過，又條地飛開了。</p>
<p>「啊，祖國！啊，家庭！啊，朋友！……生命的奔波，身心的流轉。……啊，什麼時候自己有個甜靜的境界？」</p>
<p>「眼前的混沌，經常的摸索。啊，讓灰色的雲堆吹雲了過去的陰影；啊，讓赤道的烈陽照澈了心底虛無。」</p>
<p>於是，化石般是是自己的身軀：麻痹的是自己的熱血。讓陰沉的時間從靠背椅上飛過，讓多年的碰壁和靈魂的陰影從植物園中消逝。</p>
<p>然後暮藹來臨，灰色的雲又蓋上黑塊了。一日的時間又成過去，植物園的陰影消磨了我半天的光陰。</p>
<p>「什麼是明天呢？什麼是明天呢？」自己喃喃地道。懶懶的站起身，踱出園門，趁車歸去了。</p>
<h3>遷居</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>——山城之什——</p>
<p>在公館裏只住了兩天，早晨，當起身以後，見了進出於這個門洞裏的人，總不免要「招乎番」，人，不算很少，雖然分不清那一位對這裏的輩分以及交誼究竟到了怎樣的程度，雖然也分不清那一位的尊姓大名應該如何雲稱呼，但，一見面談上四五句話，保持着禮尚的「酬應」，就能使你吃不消，更不要說暢談了。</p>
<p>當天夜裏，在計議以後，我和老鐵兩個人搬出公館住客棧去了。</p>
<p>客棧，就在距離公館不遠的斜對面，也是座樓房，所謂樓，是不能和上海相比的。進門的地方，有一面在的櫃台，招乎着進出的客商，旁邊，是寬敞的通道，穿過通道，是大的天井，沿了兩旁的小走道再進去，才是我們借寓的樓房。</p>
<p>才去的時候，我們很奇怪，為什麼這裏看不見同住的客商？這什麼樓下的客堂裏不看見一點陳設？為什麼火油和布匹之類的容易發生危險的東西會讓牠靠入在屋角？還有，為什麼櫃台上的小夥計以及老板都向我們扮着鬼臉？……這些，我們知道不是陌生的人可以立即體會的，管牠，住下去再說！</p>
<p>屋子確實不能算小，有裏外兩大間，單以面積來論，在上海就得三塊多一天，要提到裏面的布置，簡陋的程度也是可以的，除了兩張木板床，一張老式的三鬥桌，桌子的下面，還裝着彫花的脚板，其餘，還有小圓凳兩方，茶幾一只，以外，什麼都没有了。好在是熱天，不不然，破碎的窗屝，外面又緊靠着一條窄狹的幽暗的小弄，從人家的屋脊上吹過來的那一陣寒風，真受不了。地板還平，不過，那彈簧的軟性，我們的心都放不下，說不定說話或者是睡熟以後，會莫明其妙的把我們陷了下去。</p>
<p>在這裏，雖没有什麼旅客須知的條文，然而，每種事情你都得多加小心，走路的時候和洗臉的時候，要像作賊一樣，輕輕地，頂好不要有聲，倘使你的脚步重一點或者臉水濺在盆子的外邊，樓下就能哇哇大呌——　　——樓上的水滴到碗裏嘍！灰都迷了眼睛嘍！</p>
<p>傍晚時分，被汗臭浸透了的身體，如果想痛快的洗一個澡　暢一下，那簡直是作梦，事實上不容許你有這樣的自由，除非在夜靜更深店人都入睡以後。其次，要算大小便總理，在這地方，是不與什麼馬桶的，整個的客棧只有一個池子，容積了每個人所排泄的不同的貨色，而且，這池子又在最後面的小跨院裏，白天，還不覺得怎樣，要是在夜裏，没有路燈，自己得拿了火把走上黑越越地院落，恐怖，圧在心頭，那情形也的確有點怕人。一想到「坐客」，又有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>說起來是不應該怪怨客棧的簡陋的，在建設上，文明的洗禮還没有　進這遼遠的山國，渾樸的氣息，擁塞了每個人的心坎，生活，是相當低落的，住客棧，這地方並不是消遣的所在，每天三餐，連房錢在內，只有大洋五毛。</p>
<p>可是，山國是貧瘠的，五毛錢一天的代價，是拉不住過往的客商喲！</p>
<h3>逃犯（續）</h3>
<p>— 梅平</p>
<p>但是一個急逼的槍志在天空中響了起來，仿佛打中了他的身體一樣，他馬上藏身在草堆裏，不敢動，不敢呼吸，血在血管裏激流着，幾乎要爆炸的樣子。他仰起頭來望望巡望樓上，已經點起了明亮的燈光，人聲也沸騰着，接着城牆上都是往來的人影子，這顯然他們已經發發現了逃犯所走的途徑。於是一種生的勇氣鼓着他在草堆裏奔走，他不敢探起頭來，讓那些無情的荊棘刺着他的眼睛。</p>
<p>北關的城門開了，一隊巡望兵執着火把從城裏沖出來，槍尖上了刺刀，每個人都像獵犬那樣在草堆裏嗅尋他們的目的物。黎明時的秋風拂動着草的波浪，常常引起他們粗魯的喊聲：「出來！開槍了！」但是草堆裏什麼動靜也没有，於是，真的砰的一聲向前射去……</p>
<p>槍聲，人聲，火把，在北關外面直鬧到天色發白。</p>
<p>那個囚犯逃了了野草堆，逃出了搜捕者的槍刺，現在他坐在離碼頭幾丈遠的一所坍毁的屋子下，他撫摩着受創的每一處皮膚，血漬流了幹潔，幹潔了又流，他想着這個模樣在碼頭上出現時，他馬上有被捕的危險。頭班輪船吹着汽笛，或許碼頭上已經沸議着昨晚的軍警搜捕逃犯的新聞，或許上了刺刀的軍警已經在碼頭上檢查每一個上船的旅客，或許那些巡望兵又開出北關的門，從草堆中一路搜尋過來，或許…想到這裏時，他覺得冒了這樣大的危險逃獄出來，實</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>在　　　的舉動，　犯的是搶竊罪，判了三個月徒刑，三個月在他的生活中是最最短的一個時間，而且監獄中的生活不是比每天在街頭流浪强的侈嗎？每天聽着鈴聲吃一餐飯，二餐粥，在他的過去難得有這樣舒服的日子好過，那末，為什麼不安靜地過九十天時光呢？這樣問着自己，他馬上想去自首，祗要法官不判他死刑，多少長的監禁時問，他都願意接受的。</p>
<p>像逃獄時候一樣，他很快地站了起來，但是沒有開步，他又跌在地上，他的腿上，脚底，）都受了荆棘的創傷，剛才因為要逃命，什麼苦痛都忍受着，現在才覺得兩條腿已經再不能移動一步路了。</p>
<p>頭班輪船又放了二次汽笛，他望着烟囪里吐著濃厚的黑烟向自由的河流中駛出了碼頭。太陽從東方升起來，强烈的光芒正刺着他的眼睛，使他的眼睛痛得不能張開來，好像分別了幾天的太陽已經不見從前坐在城墻脚下捫蝨子時的那個了。肚子里更餓得難受，耳朶邊彷彿嚮着一陣音樂一樣的聲音，是監獄里早餐的鈴聲，於是他從屋子下爬出來，坐在明亮的太陽底下，他希望碼頭上有一個人馬上看見，或者草堆里的巡望兵已經躱在他的背後了。他願意接受法律的裁判，法律正是為他們一般人而設施的，他要吃飯，他肚子餓了……</p>
<h3>兄妹</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>哥哥是九歲吧，名字呌振通。他的妹妹大概是六歲不知是七歲，我不曉得她的名字。她的天眞的小臉兒，正跟她的哥哥的一樣可愛。她的哥哥是在我們的小學裏念書，我一見到她，我就對她說：「喂！小妹妹！來，來我們這裏讀書，」她的小臉兒上立刻現出一層快樂的笑來，在她向我點一點頭的當兒，她臉上的甜笑一下子就沒了，六七歲的小孩子竟然也會向我這末說的：「先生！我們沒錢。」我記起來了，她的哥哥是我們學校里的「免費生。」我對着她發呆了會兒，顯然我的喉音是悽顫的，我和她說：「你來讀，我們不要你的學費。」快樂的笑臉兒父顯現出我的眼前了，可是一下子，她轉身走跑了，我聽到她一句話兒：「我去對媽說。」</p>
<p>這一對天眞的兄妹的爸爸是個賣水菓的，媽媽我也曾見過，是個臉兒黃黃的有病中年女人。我記得很淸楚：當開學的一天，他們的爸爸手裏揑着一張一元的鈔票，琵琵瑟瑟的走進辦公室來，用着求懇的聲調向我們的校長先生說：「先生：這一塊錢算作我的一點小意思吧！」我們的校長先生總是說：「算了！算了！我們不要你的錢。」這才他放心了似地，躬着腰，嘴裏道謝着，一直退、出到校門口。</p>
<p>可是第二天，振通的妹妹並沒有來，非但她沒有來，就是她的哥哥也不曾來。我驚怪了：因為振通是沒有一天不到校裏來讀書的。到了下半天，由小朋友們的報吿，我才曉得：振通的爸爸為了要付三個月的房租，去攔路搶人的帽子，被抓去吃官司了。當時我非常出於意料之外的一驚，同時，我正為那一對天眞的無邪的兄妹的前途担憂。</p>
<p>有兩個月了，振通沒有來念書，他的妹妹的天眞我也忘了。偶然在弄堂里看見，她也很快地逃掉，好像她也怕羞她的爸爸做了一伴盜刦的事件吧？我輕微地歎了一口氣，我也不自覺地很快走過她：我變得也怕見她了。</p>
<p>一天早上，媽吿訴我那個天眞的小囝，振通的媽媽死啦！「什麼？」我驚住了。媽媽說：「生癆病，乾血癆死的！」我並不替那個有病的黃臉中年女人可憐，在我的心葉上，我永不能忘掉那一對兒妹的。</p>
<p>一點鐘左右，我有　出　云，正　遇到那個中年女人的棺材被抬走。振通和他的妹妹哀傷地跟在棺材後后走著。是那麼冷悽悽的，沒人注目地，那個中年女人被抬走了。</p>
<p>平地人間世是又多添了一齣悲劇了我的淚差點兒沒滾了出來。這天，我是沉默·深思·過了的。我不能不為那兩個天眞的無邪的兄妹的前途担憂。唉！他們是會變成流浪的野孩子的！一想起橋頭的小呌化子，我眞要為那兩個兄妹的命運失聲痛哭了。</p>
<p>後來經我的媽媽吿訴我，說：那兩個孩子已由他們的叔叔領去了。他們的叔叔是也住在我們這弄堂里的。我的心兒寬慰不少了。我祝福他們的乖舛的命運好起來。</p>
<p>這並不是宿命論者的說法：「命裏是注定苦的了」。多少不幸的人們，是都可以在這個不合理的社會裏找出他們不幸的根源來的。一禮拜後，我又從我的媽媽那兒聽來消息，說：「他們的叔叔也因攔刦路入被捕了。」</p>
<p>現在，這兩個孩子：一個是九歲的男孩子，一個是六七歲的女孩子，讓他們去跟上海這個環境奮鬥吧。我除了希望他們不會被環境壓碎外，我是再也不能用悲傷來表示我這無用的「人道主義」了。可不是嗎，這世界正不知有着多少的孩子在那種所謂乖舛的命運裏過着生活哩？</p>

The Japanese army only has one regiment stationed there, and it is expected that there will be no major actions within a few days.

Matters for discussion: (1) The Sino-Soviet Postal Parcel Exchange Agreement was resolved and passed according to the results of the Foreign Affairs Committee's review. (2) The International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Adult Women was resolved and re-submitted for review. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the Sino-Soviet Postal Parcel Exchange Agreement, Lou Tongsun reported on the review process, saying that the agreement was generally the same in spirit as the International Postal Parcel Agreement, and was established on the principle of mutual benefit. The content was generally appropriate, and China has already signed a postal parcel agreement with Malaya, which is the same. It is proposed to pass the case. Although China pays more to the Soviet Union in terms of freight, it is because the Soviet Union's necessary expenses for transporting parcels are higher than ours, and the freight for this agreement with other countries is also stipulated in this way, so it is not appropriate to be different to us. After Lou finished reporting, there was no dissent and the case was passed. The full text of the agreement, consisting of twenty-two articles, will be officially promulgated and implemented by the National Government. Subsequently, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Adult Women was reviewed. The results of the review by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Criminal Law Committee of the Yuan were that Article 10, Paragraph 1 of the Convention stipulated that the contracting states, when signing, ratifying, or acceding to the Convention, could declare that the acceptance of the Convention did not entail the obligations defined in the Convention for colonies, protectorates, overseas territories, etc., and the sale of women was most prevalent in these areas. Even if the Convention were ratified, its effect would be limited. Moreover, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, Siam, and other countries have not yet ratified it, so we should also postpone the ratification of this Convention. Luo Yunyan and others said that the Convention should have been ratified because it maintained justice and humanity, but because of Article 10, Paragraph 1, a special stipulation, it was necessary to conduct a detailed investigation. They advocated re-submitting the case for review during the investigation period. Zhao Maohua and others advocated that it should be ratified immediately in order to improve the treatment of women. Wu Shangying and others advocated maintaining the results of the review by the two committees. Members spoke successively, more than twenty times in total, and the debate was extremely fierce. After the chairman announced the vote, Luo's motion was passed by a majority, and as a result, the case was still submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Criminal Law Committee for review.

<h3>The Triangular Relationship Between Great Britain, Japan, and the United States in the Far East (Part II)</h3>
<p>— Translation by Yiyi</p>
<p>Similarly, the situation in the Pacific shows that Japan's aggression has not only not reduced the danger of the "Chinese Revolution," but has actually deepened it. The general international situation shows that Britain cannot isolate itself from the conflict in the Far East. To prevent a world war, Britain must take steps to confront Japan. However, the scope of Britain's mobilization has been limited. In the midst of a tense European situation, its hands and feet are tied, and it can no longer use force as a means of coercion. Moreover, Japan's relative success in North China has reduced Japan's desire to negotiate with Britain within a limited scope of expansion. Not only that, but the United States, due to the shift in its own policies, can no longer be "regarded" as an equal force to Japan. Therefore, Britain must first make up its mind to protect its own interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>The United States, on the other hand, repeatedly looks to the East to "use" Britain. Since the Roosevelt administration came to power, the United States has adopted a new strategy. The new government is implementing the Stimson Doctrine, but has no longer issued resounding protests to Japan regarding Japan's gradual progress. On the other hand, "economic" attempts have ceased, and massive naval and land construction plans have begun. Whenever Britain's concerns increase, the United States adopts such an attitude: Britain has a greater danger in the Far East than the United States. Its investments and its empire are greater there. Therefore, Britain should stand on the front line against Japan more than the United States. Although the policy of withdrawing from the Philippines was initiated due to domestic economic interests, those who hoped to remove the United States' protection from the gates of Singapore and India, thereby compelling Britain to act, also supported this policy.</p>
<p>The United States thus stands on the receiving end. It accepted from Japan the offer of a non-aggression pact and cooperation between the two countries. It knew that these two items would only result in binding the hands of the United States, allowing Japan to continue its aggression against China at will, so it silently rejected them. It accepted the offer of friendly cooperation from Britain, which, although vague, was sincere. Britain is looking for action and allies. Due to the situation in Europe, it cannot take actions that might lead to war, but it can try to consolidate China – this is how the evolution of the situation of the Lytton Commission came about, but it also created the isolation of Japan, Britain, and the United States. Japan, approaching the background of war, single-mindedly continues to advance. Britain and the United States, unable to exercise military means alone, feel that the unilateral moral pressure is ineffective, but cannot find collaborators. The two countries are clearly standing in an anti-Japanese position, but cannot take the actions required by this position.</p>
<p>Now there are several signs showing that such actions will be taken. Because military efforts are impossible for both powers, they must find ways to make multilateral moral or economic actions effective. Possible collaborators are Great Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. During the period when they are threatened by Japan, they all oppose Japan. The United States has already recognized the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union proposed a multi-faceted non-aggression pact, which closely conforms to the Soviet concept of collective security and Litvinov's definition of an aggressor state. Britain, for its part, understood the principle of the Soviet Union's "indivisible peace," felt the weight behind its "peace policy," and adopted a more cooperative attitude toward the Soviet Union. Britain is now thinking again about seeking tools in Nanjing for its policies. It hopes to build a wall to defend against Japan by financially consolidating Nanjing. The United States, on the other hand, has long been disillusioned with the possibility of cooperating with Nanjing. Although the limited assistance it has given to Nanjing cannot be said to be offset by its silver policy. However, the United States is ultimately worried that the Nanjing authorities will succumb to the foreign country that is the strongest and most active in China due to environmental pressure.</p>
<p>Under the threat of Japanese aggression, whether Britain and the United States will successfully defend their positions and interests in the Far East depends entirely on how the international front against Japan is formed. This, in turn, depends entirely on whether Britain and the United States can fully overcome their mutual contradictions and find a basis for cooperation in the Far East. This even depends entirely on whether they are prepared to support China's national liberation movement. Without this preparation, the status quo cannot be restored. Because unilateral military action is impossible for Britain or the United States, and because unilateral "moral pressure" has proven ineffective, the situation in the Far East depends on the decision of Britain and the United States to conduct or oppose the international cooperation movement. A negative answer not only gives Japan the opportunity to act arbitrarily in China and the entire Far East. In fact, this also has the significance of Britain and the United States withdrawing from the Far East. This increases the threat of colonial revolution, because the expansion of revolutionary forces is becoming the only means for colonial and semi-colonial countries to resist aggression. Finally, this will lead to the outbreak of a world war. It is inevitable that small Japan will extend its reach to the borders of the Soviet Union, or to the borders of any other great power's colonies. An affirmative answer is the only possible hope for peace and stability in the East (End).</p>

<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping</p>
<h3>The Voices of the Cultural Circles in the City of Culture</h3>
<p>After the "September 8th" incident in Fengtai this year was resolved, Beiping changed from a position on the front line of national defense to a position in danger of falling into the enemy's rear. After the situation in South China and Central China became tense, the center of negotiations shifted to Nanjing, while the target of a certain party remained in North China. Since the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Nanjing have been in a state of interruption, a certain party's work in North China has become increasingly intensified, resulting in panic and rumors. The people of North China are in this situation. General observation has long expected that the people of North China will express something. Sure enough, the cultural circles, which have always been the vanguard of the people, issued a declaration on the 12th of this month. The discussion, drafting, and publication of this declaration have been brewing for a long time. As many as eighty-three people signed it. Although each person joined in an individual capacity when signing, when examining the affiliation of these persons, most of the cultural institutions in Beiping are included. This already represents the entirety of the cultural circles in Beiping. All that they express is what all the citizens want to express but have not been able to do. Judging from the current situation, this expression is being disseminated to the people of the city at an extremely fast rate, waiting for the appropriate response of the facts. Therefore, the momentum is very vigorous. Therefore, I will record what I have learned from the interviews below.</p>
<p>(1) The brewing of the incident. More than a month ago, the first initiator was the Chinese Faculty and Staff Association of Yenching University. This organization was originally a fellowship organization for faculty and staff of the university, and most of its members were scholars who buried themselves in research. In the past, the expressions and claims of various circles in Beiping regarding the current situation rarely saw the participation of members of this association. However, the initiators Gu Jiegang, Rong Geng, Liang Shichun, Chen Qitian, Tian Hongdu, Xie Yuming, Xie Jingsheng, Lei Jiehuan, Xia Yun and other eight people were usually dedicated to research work and did not ask about foreign affairs. This time, they first initiated it, and in the shortest time, they gained the sympathy of many people, which is worth noting. From the initiation to the issuance of the Declaration, there were three meetings, and the meeting place was always at Yenching University. After exchanging opinions and obtaining the same results, Zhang Yinlin was recommended to draft the declaration, and Xu Bingchang, Gu Jiegang, Feng Youlan, Qian Mu, Cui Jingbo and others were recommended to revise it. The declaration was revised three times before and after, and the final declaration was officially issued on the evening of the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>(2) The greatest significance of the initiators' decision to publicize is not in the content of the Declaration, but in the breadth of the initiators' coverage, which is sufficient to show the extent to which it represents general public opinion. The initiators who signed the Declaration, as of the 12th, already numbered eighty-three, and their affiliated cultural institutions totaled as many as twelve. There were fifteen people from the Peking University side, including Tao Xisheng, Qian Mu, Ye Gongchao, Zhang Foquan, Rong Zhaozu, Zhu Guangqian, Meng Sen, Yao Congwu, Tang Lan, Rao Yutai, Zhang Jingyue, Sun Yunzhu, Tan Xirui, Shen Jiarui, and Cui Zhilan. On the Yenching side, there were twenty-one people, including Gu Jiegang, Mei Yibao, Hong Ye, Chen Qitian, Rong Geng, Liang Shichun, Lu Kanru, Cai Yie, Guo Shaoyu, Yu Yongzi, Lei Huan, Tian Hongdu, Hou Shutong, Xie Yuming, Zhao Cheng, Xia Yun, Liu Jie, Yu Shiyu, Feng Jiasheng, Xie Jingsheng, and Li Anzhai. On the Tsinghua side, there were fourteen people, including Feng Youlan, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Zigao, Zhang Yinlin Huang Zixiang, Jin Yuelin, Wei Ziqing, Sa Bentie, Zeng Yuanrong, Li Jidong, Yang Wuzhi, Zhou Xiangeng, Xiong Dizhi, and Chen Zhen. On the Beiping Research Institute side, there were four people, including Xu Bingchang, Cui Jingbo, Wu Shichang, and Lin Zhijun. On the Islamic Education circles side, there were six people, including Ma Shuling, Xue Wenbo, Zhao Bin, Ai Yizai, Chang Songchun, and Wang Mengyang. On the Normal University side, there were four people, including Xian Xuantong, Liang Jinxi, Qi Sihe, and Yang Kun. On the Tianjin French Business School side, there were three people, including Lu Liuwen, Lian Shisheng, and Yang Xiufeng. On the China Construction Society side, there were two people, including Liang Sicheng and Liu Dunzhen. On the side of the Women's Liberal Arts College of Peking University, there were six people, including Yan Jicheng, Dong Renji, Wang Dianji, Xu Fude, Li Jigu, and Xiong Lechen. On the side of Tianjin Women's Normal School, there was one person, Feng Yuanjun. On the side of the Popular Reading Material Publishing Society, there were three people, including Li Qinnan, Wang Riwei, and Li Yifei. On the side of the Hebei Provincial Senior High School, there was one person, Jiao Shiqi. In addition, there were three people belonging to the general literary and art circles, including Yang Zhensheng, Lin Huiyin, and Shen Congwen.</p>
<p>Among these eighty-three people, the majority are in the humanities, but there are also many in the sciences, and there are three or four in politics and law, which is the opposite of the usual situation where there are more people with a strong political interest and who study politics and law. This is one. Cooperation between Muslims and Han people is not common in Beiping. The six Muslims who participated in signing the declaration this time are all important figures in the Beiping Jia Church. This is one. In the past, when Beiping educational and cultural circles made collective expressions to the outside world, those with educational administrative responsibilities were always the backbone, but this time the opposite was true. This is the third. The above three points are the characteristics of the initiators of this decision to publicize.</p>
<p>(3) Echo After the declaration was published, people here generally took a warm attitude of support. Now the initiators are continuing to solicit signatures, and participants are quite enthusiastic. It is said that when a considerable number of signatures have been collected (5,000 or 50,000 has not been determined), they will be submitted to the central government through legal procedures to show the public opinion.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of the Newspaper Industry Regarding International Peace</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The relationship between countries is either peace or war, either amity or animosity. The key to peace and war, the impetus for amity and animosity, lies half with government authorities and half with public opinion organs. Rational decisions are few, while emotional impulses are many. Since the rise of the modern newspaper industry, eight or nine out of ten international wars have been instigated by irresponsible newspapers. The Spanish-American War was entirely created by the New York Journal and the New York World. The First World War would not have erupted without the incitement of newspapers in Austria, Germany, Russia, and Serbia. Historian Fay has stated that the newspapers of various countries fan the flames of nationalism, sow the seeds of war, and bewitch the people to abandon peace and resort to slaughter, making it impossible for diplomatic authorities to conduct peace negotiations, and causing both countries' governments and peoples to lose their clear minds and act on emotion. This is truly a stain on the modern newspaper industry and urgently needs reform. The crisis of peace in the Far East is now at its peak, yet the public opinion organs representing the two major powers in the Far East have not fully realized the significance of their mission and the seriousness of their responsibility. This is truly an unfortunate phenomenon. Since the beginning of this month, the Beijing and Shanghai newspaper industries, recognizing the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, declared that the newspaper industry can no longer evade the responsibility for peace, and earnestly requested neighboring countries' newspapers to work together, to refrain from making propaganda that hinders the friendship between the two countries in a passive way, and to foster the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people in an active way, in order to save the peace between the two countries in the nick of time. However, for half a month, the newspaper industry of that country has turned a blind eye. Recently, Japanese person Ishibashi Tanzan wrote an article bitterly criticizing the Japanese newspaper industry for "specializing in destroying the relations between Japan and foreign countries, and having absolutely no intention of maintaining international relations, embracing extreme patriotism, and almost becoming a diplomatic organ of bureaucratic politics," and stated that "newspapers should guide national diplomacy and enhance the people's international understanding as a basis for mutual friendship. If newspapers of the two countries establish contact, it can promote the improvement of relations between the two countries." Ishibashi's words can be said to have truly captured my heart. A voice in an empty valley, though faint, is extremely precious.</p>
<p>We believe that the formation of a war atmosphere is mostly due to misunderstandings, and irresponsible newspapers then embellish and amplify them, avoiding talking about the good deeds of neighboring countries and competing to highlight the flaws of neighboring countries, fostering in peacetime the "hostility towards neighboring countries, the contempt for neighboring countries, the fear of neighboring countries, and the inferior concepts of neighboring countries" in the minds of the people. Once there are slightly unfortunate events in national relations, they further describe how brutal and how contemptible the neighboring country is, further criticizing its diplomatic authorities for being so weak and so misguided, and further inciting its people to think how superior and how patriotic they are, and how they should be xenophobic and how they should invade. Once the emotion of war is aroused, the people lack the power of reason, like a tide surging and a waterfall falling, and the rupture of national relations becomes irreparable.</p>
<p>Now that the sun has set in the east, the evening glow is not yet abundant. If the newspaper industry of our neighboring country realizes the importance of its own responsibility, feels the futility of stirring up emotions, rises up courageously, and urgently changes its policy to use the power of creating hatred to create goodwill, and to promote the idea of coexistence and co-prosperity instead of advocating narrow-minded patriotism, then the government authorities of that country who have the sincerity to adjust Sino-Japanese relations can calmly engage in it, and those who harbor the intention of exhausting their troops and engaging in endless wars will also know that public opinion is unwilling to wage war and will have some scruples and rein in at the cliff's edge. The power lies with the responsible figures in the newspaper industry. We welcome Mr. Ishibashi's suggestion, and we hope that those in the newspaper industry of that country will understand the responsibility they should bear for international peace and make efforts.</p>
<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Silver Purchase Agreement Still Valid, Unaffected by Sino-British Loan Negotiations, U.S. Continues to Buy Silver from Abroad</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau officially stated today that the silver agreement signed by the United States is still in effect. The Sino-British loan negotiations and the Anglo-American-French monetary stabilization agreement have no direct impact on it. Even if the Sino-British negotiations involve the United States, the United States will continue to purchase silver from China without interruption. Regarding this matter, there will be no new negotiations with China in the future. Morgenthau continued to say that the United States is now purchasing silver from Canada, Mexico, and London as usual, and Cuba is minting silver coins, which proves that the monetary stabilization agreement has not affected silver and China. The Treasury Secretary finally stated that all agreements and negotiations have been made public. (15th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebels Launch Large-Scale Offensive, Front Thirty Miles Long, Two Towns West of Capital Fall in Succession</h3>
<p>Seville According to the radio station here today, the Nationalist army has launched a large-scale offensive towards Madrid along a thirty-mile front, and has occupied important locations. Those advancing from San Martin have occupied Chapineria Town, twenty-five miles from the capital on the direct road to the capital. The army column led by Colonel Yagüe has advanced several miles, and the troops of Colonel Castejón have also occupied Navas del Rey Town. The column of Colonel Gaita is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the government army. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>

General Mola, the commander of the Nationalist army's forward troops in the vicinity of the capital, plans to launch a general attack on Madrid after Navalcarnero (thirteen kilometers from the capital) is captured. Regarding this matter, General Del Llano, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Route, recently issued a broadcast message stating that the town has already fallen. In addition, after the Nationalist army captured Sigüenza, northeast of the capital, the four hundred militiamen trapped in the cathedral in the city surrendered without a fight yesterday, along with many hostages.

<h3>Soviet Union Sympathizes with Anti-Fascist War, Labor Masses Declare: Effective Neutrality Cannot Be Achieved, Only Military Aid to the Spanish Government</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today's conference of laboring masses issued a declaration stating that if Soviet Russia cannot achieve "effective neutrality," it should provide military aid to the Spanish government. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party recently sent a telegram of thanks and greetings. Stalin replied to Comrade Diaz, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, saying, "The Soviet laborers are doing their best to assist the revolutionary masses of Spain, but they are only fulfilling their responsibility. They believe that the liberation of Spain from the oppression of fascist reactionaries is not a private matter of the Spanish people, but a common cause of all progressive and advanced people. Greetings of friendship." (16th TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3>Russia Asks for Coast Blockade, Portugal Remains Calm, Britain and France Unwilling to Interfere, Expected All Along</h3>

As for Portugal, it has already fulfilled the non-intervention agreement, but due to various incidents, it has suspicions about the Adjustment Committee, and there is a reason for this.

<h3>Albanian King Resides in France, Very Close to Geneva, Half an Hour by Car</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that the Albanian King has purchased a residence in the French free zone near Geneva. The residence is about fifteen miles from the Swiss border and less than half an hour's drive from the League of Nations office. It is expected that the Albanian King will ask the French government to allow him to reside there. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Lion Mane Cloak Prized by Albanian King, Falls into the Hands of the Blackshirt Prime Minister</h3>
<p>A recent article in the Allied Press reported on the rare cloak worn by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which was decorated with lion manes, making him look even more self-important. However, this cloak cost a huge amount of money and countless lives. The value of this cloak is probably the highest in the world, as it is a souvenir obtained by the Blackshirt Prime Minister when he conquered Abyssinia. The Emperor of Abyssinia made this cloak five years ago and prized it greatly, not wearing it often. Since Italy launched a large-scale conquest of Abyssinia, the Emperor appointed Chief Ras Gugsa to guard an important location, possessing a large number of troops. However, he was at odds with the Emperor and had long harbored disloyal intentions. The Emperor summoned him to the capital, treating him with great favor. Ras Gugsa also swore loyalty to the country, willing to serve. The Emperor believed him and bestowed upon him the lion mane cloak, which he considered precious, to show special favor, hoping that he would work harder. Unexpectedly, the first person to raise the flag of rebellion was this very loyal council member, Ras Gugsa. After surrendering to Italy, he personally wrote a letter to Prime Minister Mussolini, along with the lion mane cloak. The letter stated, "The people of Abyssinia, bathed in Your Excellency's vast virtue, wish to enjoy peace and prosperity under the Italian flag. I am attaching the cloak to express my gratitude." Currently, Gugsa serves as the governor of the Kleve province, wielding power and influence, while the Emperor is exiled in London, spending his sorrowful days.</p>

However, Ms. Batten was not moved and said, "If I am lost at sea, do not send anyone to look for me. I am doing this of my own free will and I believe I will succeed.

<h3>Domestic and International Situation Urgent, French Foreign Policy Set to Change Course, Will Ask Belgium to Explain Neutrality Concept, Anglo-French Consultation on Proper Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to confirmed information, the French government intends to re-examine its foreign policy to cope with the emerging domestic and international issues. The urgent problems to be dealt with are as follows: (1) It is reported that German leader Hitler will soon declare the Rhineland a military zone. (2) After the Italian-German compromise, they will unite the authoritarian political countries and organize the Central European Fascist Group. (3) The final victory of the Spanish revolution will belong to the right wing. (4) Domestic newspapers are sparing no effort in attacking the government. Recently, King Leopold III of Belgium announced the restoration of his country's policy of neutrality, making the change of French foreign policy even more urgent. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum, Foreign Minister Delbos, and National Defense Minister Daladier held a long meeting this morning, during which they discussed in detail the declaration issued by the Belgian King and its consequences in terms of diplomatic and military affairs. In addition, Foreign Ministry personnel are carefully studying the Belgian King's declaration, as this declaration has already created a new international situation. France must carefully review the stance it will take in response to this new situation before it can be determined. It is expected that France will ask Belgium what attitude it will take towards the obligations it bears in the Locarno Treaty. The Locarno Treaty, signed in 1925, was renewed by Britain, France, and Belgium in London on March 19 this year after Germany abrogated the treaty and stationed troops in the Rhineland. Its validity has not been eliminated to this day. In addition, France will also inquire about Belgium's attitude towards the Western European Air Treaty. Both Britain and France are guarantors of the Locarno Treaty and the territorial integrity of Belgium, so France will also consult with Britain. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Because the Belgian King announced his advocacy for Belgium to restore its pre-war neutrality policy, the French government will send a note to the Belgian government. It is reported that the note will ask Belgium to explain its concept of neutrality, and will raise several questions regarding Belgium's obligations in other matters. It will also inquire about what new impact Belgium's new policy will have on the harmonious work of the French and Belgian army staffs, and what attitude Belgium now holds towards the League of Nations. It is reported that the French government intends to consult with the British government to determine the most appropriate countermeasures. The French government believes that the obligations of France and Britain to Belgium and the Locarno Treaty are mutual, as evidenced by the British government's note of April 1. This is one of the main reasons why France intends to consult with Britain. It is believed that talks with Belgium will begin soon regarding Belgium's attitude towards the new Western European treaty. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Belgium Has No Intention of Withdrawing from the League of Nations, Still Willing to Abide by International Obligations</h3>
<p>(London) The Belgian Ambassador to Britain visited Foreign Secretary Eden today. It is reported that he explained that the Belgian King's announcement of the new policy does not mean that Belgium will no longer assume any obligations. Belgium will also remain a loyal member of the League of Nations. It is believed that the new policy announced by the Belgian King is most relevant to future negotiations among the powers of the Locarno Treaty. Belgium hopes to be a guarantor in the treaty, rather than a guarantor. If this new policy is successful, then Belgium and France can negotiate amendments to the 1920 Franco-Belgian defensive military agreement. It is reported that Belgium will never deny the Locarno Treaty under any circumstances. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Strengthening Border Defenses to Protect Territory, Still Intends to Cooperate Technically with France</h3>
<p>(Brussels) Official circles have not made any criticism of the Belgian King's statements on the policy of neutrality, but according to well-informed sources, Belgium will not deny all international treaties as a result, so Belgium has not indicated that it intends to withdraw from the League of Nations. The current problem for the Belgian government is to determine to what extent Belgium will exceed its obligations already agreed upon with the League of Nations if it signs the currently planned Western European Convention. According to the Belgian diplomatic community, if Belgium does not sign the convention, it will still be bound by its obligations to the League of Nations, so Belgium has not considered denying the principle of collective security. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Brussels) After King Leopold III issued a declaration the other day, political figures here have explained that the documents exchanged between the French and Belgian staffs in March of this year regarding technical cooperation will continue to be valid. Belgium has no intention of denying the obligations it has undertaken with the League of Nations, and will also participate in the decisions that the League of Nations may take in the future to implement the mutual assistance system. The King's intention is to get rid of other obligations that Belgium is unwilling to accept, and not to place them before other countries as a fait accompli. Although the Council of Ministers has taken various measures militarily the other day, it has not sent additional troops to the area near the French border, but has strengthened defenses in the northeastern border area near Germany and the Netherlands, in order to see that Belgium is striving to deal with the only crisis, in other words, to deal with Germany's powerful military force. Moreover, the Belgian government previously intended to extend the technical cooperation between the French and Belgian staffs to Britain and the Netherlands, but not to cooperate with Germany. This is another clear proof. In short, the leaders of the Flemish nation originally opposed this technical cooperation method. Since the King issued a declaration the other day, the leaders of those nations know that this cooperation method is only aimed at protecting Belgian territory and does not include other obligations, and will naturally be happy to accept it. In addition, one of the purposes of the King's declaration is to persuade the Flemish nation to support the government's national defense strengthening plan, because that nation once thought that Belgium's participation in various international agreements, especially the Locarno Treaty, would require sending troops abroad to fulfill its obligations. This nation is opposed to fighting abroad, and it is even more uneasy about the mutual assistance agreement signed between France and Soviet Russia. Moreover, the fascist Rex Party has recently been engaged in propaganda to explain the dangers of Belgium concluding alliance treaties with other countries, which the government feels uneasy about, because the government is planning to make efforts militarily (referring to the national defense strengthening plan). It is not easy to unite the entire country to support the government unless all the people are aware that this effort is only to protect the interests of their own country. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Franco-Belgian Diplomatic Contacts</h3>
<p>(London) According to foreign newspapers, the announcement by Belgium of the restoration of its neutral status was discussed and decided by Britain and Belgium beforehand. This statement has now been denied by responsible parties. Responsible figures also stated that Britain did not know beforehand that Belgium would announce the restoration of its neutrality, which is regrettable. In addition, Foreign Office Undersecretary Vansittart met with the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, and the Belgian Ambassador to Britain, Cartier de Marchienne, this afternoon. In addition, diplomatic contacts will continue to be made so that experts in the Foreign Office can obtain sufficient information to study the impact of Belgium's new policy on various existing international agreements.

<h3>Italy and Germany Express Goodwill Toward Belgium's Restoration of Pre-War Neutrality, France Feels Extremely Uneasy</h3>
<p>Rome</p>
<p>(Rome) Belgium's new neutrality policy, announced by the Belgian King in a full cabinet meeting, has been well received in Rome. According to well-informed sources, Belgium's new attitude shows that it is willing to implement a more practical foreign policy, and is gradually approaching Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's political direction. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "German General Gazette" commented on the declaration issued by the Belgian King, saying that the Belgian Fascist Party's Rex Party and the Flemish Nationalist Party recently concluded an agreement in which the two parties will act jointly to oppose communism. This move is very important, because since the establishment of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, the power of the Belgian Rex Party has greatly increased. At the same time, people in this country's military circles also obviously want to change their previous military concepts. This is the reason why Belgium decided to restore its pre-war neutral status. Moreover, after this country's attitude changes, the impact on the upcoming negotiations on the Western European Security Convention will be extremely large. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Spiritual and Material Damage</h3>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>(Paris) After King Leopold announced his neutrality declaration yesterday, the Socialist Party's newspaper, "Le Populaire," commented, "This declaration is somewhat ambiguous. We hope the Belgian side will provide an explanation so we can make an objective assessment. This policy evolution in Belgium has been long in the making, but it was only recently, due to strong pressure from the fascist Rex Party and the uncompromising attitude of the Flemish Nationalist Party, that a decision was made." Other newspapers have distinguished between the material and spiritual impacts that this policy could cause, stating that the tense European situation, cited by the King as a justification, is due to the repeated violations of treaties in recent years and the repeated submission of major European powers. The "Echo de Paris" published an article by the renowned journalist Bertin, which stated, "If France and England can take some action, the material damage caused by King Leopold's declaration can be mitigated." Retired General Niessel published an article in "L'Ere Nouvelle," saying, "Geographically, Belgium's maintaining neutrality, while not as beneficial to France as an alliance between Belgium and France, is not far off. If Germany violates neutrality, the resistance from Belgium's modern army will make their passage through Belgian territory longer than in 1914. This means that France, not being obliged to respond to Belgium due to the absence of an alliance, can calmly arrange its defenses." Spiritually, all newspapers said that this attitude of Belgium has already caused significant damage. "Le Petit Parisien" reported, "Although Berlin, Rome, and The Hague have all expressed satisfaction with King Leopold's declaration, Paris, London, Moscow, and the capitals of the Little Entente, in other words, the capitals of countries that support collective security and the League of Nations, were all surprised and disappointed upon hearing King Leopold's words, and felt uneasy." The "Echo de Paris" reported, "Since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty on March 7 this year, and the major powers failed to respond appropriately, people have been worried that one of the Little Entente countries would retreat midway, or even that the Entente would collapse. Since Germany and Poland signed a non-aggression pact on January 26, 1934, Poland's attitude has changed (fortunately, not drastically, and it eventually renewed its friendship with France). Now, the one retreating midway is our neighbor Belgium. This is something we did not expect. What we should worry about in the future is the impact of Belgium's actions on Poland and Romania, and the urgent need for action. Time is of the essence, so we must be cautious." The Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" reported, "When fascism engaged in aggression in East Africa, the major powers sat idly by and failed to remedy the failure of the League of Nations' peace process. That day was the day that small and weak nations abandoned the alliance, and France was isolated... The situation is urgent and allows no further hesitation. Organizing peace means gathering and organizing the peaceful will of all of Europe and the world, not wasting weeks inquiring about Hitler's opinions." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Two Paths for Neutral Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) The semi-official "Le Temps" commented on King Leopold's declaration yesterday, stating, "Belgium is adopting a 'completely Belgian policy,' which Belgium has the right to weigh. However, a faithful neutral status must be strongly guaranteed. Otherwise, it will not only endanger Belgium but also its neighbors. In short, there are two paths for a neutral policy. One is the policy adopted by the Netherlands and Switzerland. The other is to conclude an agreement guaranteeing mutual security and stipulating mutual obligations. Which of these two paths is better can only be judged by future events." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Foundation of Collective Security Shaken</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania King Leopold's declaration has deeply impressed political figures here. Romania's foreign policy has always been based on the collective security system, and Belgium's new policy inevitably affects the collective security system, which Romania cannot but pay attention to. According to political figures, Belgium's move is enough to shake all diplomatic actions based on the League of Nations and plunge Europe into a new situation. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Prague Regarding the declaration made by the King of Belgium yesterday, most people here do not comment on it, but some criticize it. The Social Nationalist Party's newspaper, "Československá Republika," stated, "If Belgium is unwilling to help other countries, how can it expect other countries to help it?" The semi-official newspaper "Lidové Noviny" stated that England and France should therefore become closer. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>A Bomb Thrown at European Security</h3>
<p>(New York) The "New York Evening Post" recently commented on King Leopold's declaration, stating, "This decision is extremely important. Its inner meaning must be that Germany has abandoned the plan devised by General Schlieffen before the European War, which was to attack France through Belgium. "It is hoped that Germany has learned a lesson from the European War. Otherwise, what the King of Belgium has done is very dangerous." The European collective defense system was already dying, and King Leopold has now administered the final blow. "If the King has made a big mistake, all of Europe will be affected. The weaker France becomes, the sooner Germany will attack Soviet Russia." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Rosenberg Anti-Russian Remarks Incompatible with Communism</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Rosenberg, director of the National Socialist Party's foreign affairs department, gave a speech at a reception for the diplomatic corps and foreign journalists yesterday, again fiercely attacking the Soviet Union, saying, "The current problem is not a conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, nor a conflict between Bolshevism, Italianism, and fascism, but a conflict between worldwide Bolshevism and Europe, which are incompatible. That is, the alliance between the Bolshevism of barren areas and international Judaism is attempting to destroy the order of Europe." The idea of collective and total peace is the starting point of Bolshevism. "We have good reason to be shocked by the speech given by French Communist Party Secretary-General Thorez in Strasbourg the other day, attacking our country. What Thorez is doing is trying to prevent sincere cooperation between France and Germany. How can we forget that the wish of communism is to destroy all countries that have not yet succumbed? We must fight it in a free and open manner." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>British Naval and Air Forces Increase Strength in the Far East Two Air Force Squadrons Permanently Stationed in Hong Kong for Training Naval Commander Leach Visits Hong Kong for Inspection</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Communication, the serious situation in the Far East is gradually unfolding. British Air Force Commander Smith came to Hong Kong in mid-September by airship to inspect the newly built Kam Tin Airfield. Smith identified Hong Kong as the base of the British naval and air forces in the Far East. After returning to Singapore via Manila by airship last month, it was heard that it was decided to increase two air force squadrons to be permanently stationed in Hong Kong for training. They can fly to Kowloon one after another this month. It is verified that there are two major airfields in Kowloon. The Kam Tin Airfield in Fanling is purely for military use and can accommodate the takeoff and landing of 1,000 aircraft. Underground warehouses, oil storage depots, repair shops, and air force personnel dormitories are all in the New Territories surrounding the airfield, covering an area of five square miles of mountains and plains. Villages, residential areas, and fields near the airfield that have been included in the air force area have all been purchased by the government at a fair price for public use. Tunnels have been dug in all the mountains, and workers are rushing to build new-style fortifications day and night. The underground works are expected to be completed by the end of this year. The above-ground buildings will be surveyed and mapped starting in October. The newly arrived air force can be concentrated in Kam Tin. Another airfield, called Kai Tak Airport, is located in Kowloon City. It is built against the mountain and by the sea, covering an area of about two square miles. This airport is now designated as the place for international commercial civil aviation aircraft to take off and land. International airlines will make great progress starting next spring. The eastern terminal of the Trans-Pacific airline from the United States and the international connecting airline of the China National Aviation Corporation are both determined to take off and land at Kai Tak Airport. Hong Kong's importance in international transportation has increased, and the strength of the British Navy stationed in the Far East has also increased accordingly. The British Far East Fleet, which is permanently stationed in Hong Kong, has one aircraft carrier, HMS Hermes, eight cruisers of various classes, and six destroyers, which take turns patrolling the Chinese coast and the Yangtze River area. The twenty-four shallow-water gunboats were transferred to the Mediterranean and Australian areas due to the tense situation in the Mediterranean this year, and another part was transferred to Weihaiwei for summer vacation. Several ships were transferred from Singapore to Hong Kong and patrolled the Chinese coast. The two British ships "Thracian" and "Daffodil" have sailed back to Hong Kong from Weihaiwei and are berthed in the Whampoa Dock in Wan Chai to re-equip everything and increase their own combat power. The British transport ship Lancashire also sailed back to Hong Kong from the Mediterranean on the 9th, carrying a large number of senior officers of the army, navy, and air force. The ship is scheduled to transport the Hong Kong garrison back to England on the 20th of this month for new-style mechanized training. The battleships that were transferred to the Mediterranean this spring have been refitted in England and equipped with the latest large-caliber cannons. The range of the gun muzzles is much greater than before. British naval commander-in-chief in China, Rear-Admiral Leach, took the "Cornflower" ship, which had been completely refitted, to Hong Kong via Singapore. After arriving in Hong Kong on the 12th, he replaced the HMS Gannet with the Cornflower. It is said that the ship is extremely spectacular after the refit. There are aircraft hangars on both sides of the smokestack, which can carry three seaplanes. One is a high-speed reconnaissance aircraft, with a flight range of two to three hundred miles per hour, one is a bombing aircraft, and one can clamp a five-ton torpedo to fly and drop it into the water. In addition, four new rapid-firing anti-aircraft guns were added to the bow and stern of the ship, bringing the total to eight. The ship has iron mesh plywood to prevent airborne bombing. The sides of the ship have been re-clad with eight-inch-thick steel plates, which are not afraid of submarine torpedo attacks. The ship's combat performance can be imagined. After the British warships have been refitted to increase their strength, the original ships in the Far East will be re-equipped and rotated. There were originally 3,000 Chinese workers in the Hong Kong Whampoa Dock. Due to the tense naval work and the inconvenience of hiring more workers, since October, the workers in various important departments have been working overtime at night. All workers must carry a license with their own photo in order to enter and exit, to prevent spies from sneaking in to spy on secrets. At noon on the 3rd, a citizen of a certain country sneaked into Whampoa to photograph the contents of the dock and a certain ship that was being refitted. He was captured by the dock workers and sent to the police station for questioning. Several photographic negatives were confiscated, and the matter was considered settled. This alone shows the general situation of the British navy increasing its strength in the Far East, with the army and air force cooperating to defend Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Li Sihao Conducts Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation After Taking Office Song Zheyuan Expresses Principles of Cooperation Li Sihao Talks About Working Guidelines</h3>
<p>Beijing Communication, since Xiao Zhenying resigned as chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee and Wang Kemin has not yet taken office, the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has been somewhat stalled due to the lack of a person in charge. The Japanese side is very eager to realize this. Previously, when Song Zheyuan went to Tianjin, Japanese Garrison Commander Tada Hayao met with Song several times and conducted repeated research on the issue of economic cooperation. In this special situation, Song expressed that everything could be carried out under the principles of "equality, mutual benefit, coexistence, and co-prosperity." Tada also agreed with this statement. However, the scope of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation that he paid the most attention to was the layout of the transportation network, the development of mines, and the planting of cotton. Song agreed to all of these, but it remained to be discussed and decided whether to proceed through investment or a joint venture method.</p>
<p>The issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has gradually begun, and the Economic Committee cannot be without a person in charge. Song then sent a letter to Li Sihao and sent someone to Shanghai to meet with Li, hoping that he would come to the north to take the position of chairman of the Economic Committee. Due to his special request, Li flew to Beijing on a China National Aviation Corporation flight on the 10th of this month and stayed at the Beijing Hotel. For the past five days, he has met with Song four or five times. In addition to the letter of appointment as chairman of the Economic Committee, which was sent by the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee on the 12th, Zhu also relayed the eight-character principle of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation to Mr. Li, leaving the detailed methods to be discussed later, and urged Mr. Li to take office as soon as possible. Mr. Li went to the meeting at 10 am on the 15th to take office. No ceremony was held. After Mr. Li arrived at the meeting, he discussed the meeting affairs with the deputy chairman of the committee, Niu Chuanshan. He then met with committee members Zhang Zhenlu, Ye Biliang, and Zou Quansun, and convened the staff to give a brief speech. It was heard that the organization of the committee will be expanded, and it is preparing to set up a council hall. The position of chief senator will be held by Shen Nengyi, who has come to Beijing to make contact. Mr. Li met with reporters at the Economic Committee on the 15th and made a statement, saying, "Sihao has come to the north this time, and many of you have visited the Beijing Hotel first. I was out on official business and was unable to meet you. I am very sorry. Sihao has been out of politics for many years and has been living in Shanghai. Chairman Song contacted me by letter because I had handled financial affairs in North China, and sent a representative to Shanghai to discuss matters, hoping that I would come to the north to help with everything. Therefore, I have made this trip to answer Song's kind intentions. However, the current North China has a special status, and the economic situation is very different from the past. It is difficult to predict whether I can achieve results. After arriving in Beijing, I have met with Chairman Song four or five times. Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Mr. Song had previously discussed it with Commander Tada and decided to proceed under the principle of "equality, mutual benefit, coexistence, and co-prosperity." Sihao has already heard about it and will proceed according to this principle in the future. The working guidelines are roughly divided into two items: (1) Projects that are beneficial to North China; (2) Projects that do not harm national land and sovereignty. This is the principle regarding economic cooperation. The detailed content and the order in which projects are carried out are still under study. Generally speaking, the easy ones will be carried out first. The construction of the Cangshi Road and the development of the Longyan Iron Mine have been in contact before and should continue to be carried out. The cotton planting issue is a common matter and a beneficial project, so it should be promoted. Whether this matter is invested by the Japanese side or jointly operated by China and Japan is acceptable. Commander Tada and Consul General Horiuchi are all familiar with me in Shanghai. When I go to Tianjin, I will visit them for greetings after taking office. Moreover, I originally had the responsibility of handling economic affairs in North China, so there will inevitably be more contact in the future. Regarding the progress of economic cooperation, in addition to contacting Chairman Song and Commander Tada, I also need to conduct joint research with my colleagues in this committee," etc. As for the restoration of mining at the Longyan Iron Mine, the machines of the mining company are badly damaged, and it will take five to eight months to repair them. The start-up cost is estimated to be 3 million yuan, and more funds will be raised in the future. (15th)</p>
<h3>The Tan Yang Case: Full Text of the Appeal Judgment (Continued) - First Instance Judgment Reversed</h3>
<p>(3) Regarding Qin Zhongru's case of negligent homicide and Xu Yi's case of forging documents: Upon investigation, when appellant Tan Zhuohong was handling the case of Qin Zhengru's negligent homicide, Qi Yougen went to Qin Zhengru on my behalf and paid money because he could not meet with him. Qin Zhengru then entrusted Wu Zhihuan to convey the message. Zhou confessed according to Wu Zhihuan's previous statements, but after questioning by this court, Wu Zhihuan said at the time that he pointed to Qi Yougen, saying that he was sent by someone named Gong, or whether he was sent by the prosecutor, or whether he came to speak on his own without anyone's request. In response, he said that he wanted to entrust him, and he entrusted someone named Gong, who then entrusted the prosecutor to have Qin Zhengru declared innocent in this case. He feared that I would not believe his words and told me that he could host a dinner party, inviting someone named Gong to come with the prosecutor. However, it would have to be a dinner on two tables, and he also said that he only needed several hundred dollars. When further questioned whether the money was given to him by the prosecutor, or whether he was asked to take it by someone named Gong, or whether he wanted to take it himself, or if someone asked him to do so, he replied that he only said to give him the money, and he could have someone named Gong forward it to the prosecutor to have Qin Zhengru declared innocent. According to this confession, Qi Yougen ordered the spending of money, which was not Tan Zhuohong's intention. It is clear that even if Wu Zhihuan also said that Qi Yougen told me to pay money, I could not often stay at home and waited for the ship owner to come. I told the ship owner, but the ship owner said not to bother with him. The company also said not to bother with him. But after a few days, someone named Qi said that Qin Zhengru would be sentenced to three years in prison, and when the verdict came out, it was indeed three years in prison. However, since Qi Yougen had to entrust someone with the surname of Xi to connect with Tan Zhuohong, and the money he requested was handed over to Qi Yougen, before Zhengru agreed to pay the money, Qi Yougen hardly persuaded Tan Zhuohong through the surname of Xi. Therefore, before the verdict was announced in the case, Qi Yougen's claim that he would be sentenced to three years in prison was clearly an occasional remark when extorting money from Qin Zhengru, and could not be used as evidence that Tan Zhuohong demanded a bribe. The original trial's judgment on this part, which convicted Tan Zhuohong of leaking secrets and demanding bribes, was not appropriate. As for Xu Yi's case of forging documents, the original plaintiff, Cheng Li Tianzhi, initially appointed lawyer Li Shirui as the incidental civil litigation agent. Later, because lawyer Li fell ill, Yang Shaopeng was appointed as the agent. Cheng Li Tianzhi and Hu Zhetin all confirmed this. The four thousand yuan that Cheng Li Tianzhi gave to Yang Shaopeng was a public fee, which corresponds to the amount of public fees stated in the original engagement contract. Although the engagement contract stated that two thousand yuan should be paid before the trial, and the remaining two thousand yuan should be paid after a satisfactory judgment, how to establish an engagement contract is one matter, and demanding bribes is another matter. The word "satisfactory" in the contract cannot be used as evidence of demanding a bribe. Moreover, the word "satisfactory" was crossed out when the contract was signed, and it was stamped with the seal of the deceased Li Shirui (the guarantor on the contract). All four thousand yuan in public fees were paid in full before the verdict, as evidenced by the receipt issued by Yang Shaopeng. Apart from these four thousand yuan, Cheng Li Tianzhi did not confess that the appellant had made any other requests for bribes. Therefore, there is no evidence to confirm the appellants' crimes in this part. The original trial's reliance on Yang Shaopeng's claim that the "satisfactory judgment" was the target of the contract and the newspaper reports at the time that Xu Yi was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, and that the victim was our agent, and they believed that I was related to Judge Tan, and the news at the time was very loud, scaring me so much that I dared not come to the local court. Xu Yi's confession that Judge Tan was very interested in money, and the famous Guangdong Tongyi Association letter which stated that Tan Zhuohong initially solicited bribes, that Xu Yi's case was entrusted by Yang (referring to Yang Shaopeng) to lawyer Li to extort eight thousand yuan from someone named Chen, which was given to Tan Zhuohong for expenses, was used as evidence of the appellant's crime in this part. It is not known that the word "satisfactory" on the engagement contract cannot prove that the appellant demanded a bribe, as mentioned above. Yang Shaopeng and Xu Yi's confession cannot prove that the appellant demanded a bribe in this case. The letter signed by the Guangdong Tongyi Association was investigated by the prosecutor, and it was reported that no such association was established in Shanghai. Cheng Li Tianzhi also did not admit that she had paid eight thousand yuan in addition to the lawyer's fees. Therefore, the exploration of evidence in this part of the original judgment was clearly inappropriate. Furthermore, the original judgment adopted the statement in the letter from the Guangdong Tongyi Association that eight thousand yuan was extorted, which contradicted the crime of demanding a bribe. The appellants' criticism of this part of the original judgment cannot be considered unreasonable. In summary, apart from the above-mentioned item 3 and the part about soliciting bribes in item 1, which cannot be considered a crime, in the cases of Wang Bingnan and Song Dacheng, the appellants clearly used the lack of fairness in the trial as a condition for soliciting bribes, either by saying that the defendant could be handled with a considerable price or that a satisfactory outcome could be achieved with a little money. That is, they all demanded bribes for acts that went against their duties. Moreover, their continuous solicitation of bribes was based on a general intention to commit the same crime through a series of continuous acts, which should be considered as one crime. Although appellant Yang Shaopeng does not have the status of a public official, since he committed a crime jointly with a public official, he is still an accomplice according to the law. The crime of abuse of power and detention and the crime of demanding bribes committed by appellant Tan Zhuohong are not successive and should be punished concurrently. Considering the results of the appellants' crimes, a lighter criminal penalty should be imposed on each, but given the nature of their crimes, it is necessary to deprive them of their civil rights. Therefore, their civil rights should be deprived. Based on the above discussion, it is hereby concluded that in accordance with Article 361, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 31, Paragraph 1, Article 28, Article 122, Paragraph 1, Article 56, Article 37, Paragraph 2, Article 125, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 51, Item 5 of the Criminal Law, the judgment shall be as stated in the main text. This case was conducted in court by Wu Qihua, the prosecutor of this court, performing the duties of the prosecutor. October 2, 25th year of the Republic of China. The First Criminal Tribunal of the Jiangsu High Court. Presiding Judge Fang Wen. Judge Si Wen. (End)</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Frequent Reports of Robberies in Various Villages</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, on the Wu Song River, more than ten miles away from the town of Jiaozhi, a incense-burning boat carrying more than twenty women, who were burning incense for the theater, came from Kunshan. As it passed through the area, it was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat with more than ten bandits who blocked the way and robbed the boat. None of the women on board were spared. The bandits then fled. The loss in this incident was more than one hundred yuan. Also, at around 7:00 AM on the 16th, the home of Zhou Yiming, a farmer on the lakeside in Hengjing Township, was robbed by five or six armed bandits, resulting in a loss of several tens of yuan. Moreover, the home of Chen Zhiheng in Chenjiaqiao, Jinfeng Township, Dongzhu Town, Guangfu, was robbed the night before, along with the homes of three other families including Chen Chuanqing. The bandits also tied up the victim, Chen Qian, and poured cold water into her nose. The loss for the three families exceeded five hundred yuan. The Public Security Bureau has set a ten-day deadline to solve the case. The County Opium Prohibition Committee, on the 15th...</p>

<h3>Changzhou: Autopsy After Yu Shaofang's Death</h3>
<p>Yu Shaofang, the director of the Wu Yi Relief Institute and a local gentleman, passed away due to illness at 4:00 AM on the 15th, at the age of 62. He had three sons and four daughters. Yu had previously served as the magistrate of Yuqian, Tongxiang, Shaoxing and other counties in Zhejiang Province, as well as the Director of the Ouhai Circuit and the Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau. In August of this year, he returned to Changzhou from Zhejiang, and immediately fell ill. His illness progressed from malaria to dysentery. After recovering, he suddenly became unable to eat. After diagnosis by a group of doctors, no consensus could be reached. Yu knew that he would not recover, and wanting to know the truth about his illness, he made a will stating that after his death, doctors should be invited to dissect him for research purposes. His family followed his instructions and invited doctors Jiang Qiaozhong, Zong Daxing, Xu Yuanmo, Xu Chongen, and Chen Shunming. Coincidentally, Zhao Lemen, the American director of the Suzhou Bo Xi Hospital, came to Changzhou and was also invited to his residence. So at around 6:00 PM that evening, surgery was performed to open his abdomen and examine it in detail. After about three hours, it was discovered that there was a hard scar at the pylorus (the opening of the stomach into the intestine), and the gallbladder was swollen, twice the size of a normal person. Small sections of the pancreas, gallbladder, and stomach were cut from the diseased areas and taken back by the doctors of Wujin Hospital for detailed examination based on the pathological specimens, and a report was to be made later. According to the doctors' discussions, the swollen gallbladder was not the cause of death, and the cause of death was probably due to the hardening of the pancreas.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: The Swastika Society Organizes a Relief Team</h3>
<p>The local Red Swastika branch received a letter from the head office stating that due to the current situation, a relief team should be organized, named the Third Sub-Team, tentatively consisting of ten members. A meeting of all members was convened on the 14th to discuss the matter. The members immediately identified over 1,200 yuan in funding and sought members to join the relief team, which is scheduled to be established soon.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Restrictions on Food Exports to be Imposed</h3>
<p>Recently, food prices in various parts of Jiangsu Province have soared, causing concern for the people's food supply. In general, unscrupulous merchants only know how to seek profit, regardless of social peace, and continue to hoard, speculate, and smuggle exports. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce had previously resolved to telegraph the government to take measures to stop this in order to maintain the people's food supply. According to relevant sources, this year's autumn harvest was abundant, but the soaring food prices are beyond normal. The reasons for this are nothing more than hoarding and exports. However, the situation varies from place to place. Some counties are exporting, while others are requesting permission to export, even in areas of production. Moreover, the express order allowing wheat exports has not been restricted in Jiangsu Province. However, allowing unscrupulous merchants to smuggle exports and supply enemies is not in the interests of the nation and the people. Currently, Jiangsu Province plans to formulate a method to restrict food hoarding and exports in order to achieve control. It is reported that this will be submitted to the provincial government for discussion soon.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Malignant Malaria Runs Rampant</h3>
<p>In Tongyi County, malignant malaria has become increasingly prevalent in recent days, with an increasing number of deaths. The provincial government sent a telegram ordering the expansion of the prevention and control team's organization and making efforts to prevent and control the disease. The commissioner's office also stated that participation in epidemic prevention was not enthusiastic, and unscrupulous merchants were taking the opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, four regulations were issued to the Nantong County Magistrate for implementation: (1) Village and township chiefs and village heads in the epidemic area must do their best to participate in epidemic prevention work. Military police in the area and neighboring areas must also assist. (2) In the epidemic area, the epidemic prevention team has the right to hire boats, vehicles, and ships in advance, and may requisition them if necessary. (3) The county government should immediately issue a notice prohibiting the increase of prices for medicines, coffins, shrouds, etc. Violators will be punished. (4) Crack down on quack doctors and superstitious witchcraft. In the section of the Hangshan Highway being built by the Jiayu Sandian area, due to the limited time for completion, the project construction could not be completed in time. Therefore, Zhang Yucheng, the supervisor of the section, forced local laborers to join the work, offering three corners per worker. The laborers were unwilling, so the village heads were beaten. The laborers were forced to work, but disputes arose when they went to collect their wages. After a joint meeting of the village heads, the village heads, including Huang Runde, jointly filed a complaint to the county. The supervisor learned about the matter and planned to take Huang Runde away and set fire to the public houses. The villagers and road workers in the area had a fight, and several villagers were seriously injured. On the 15th, the Public Security Bureau had sent Patrol Officer Yang and other police officers to suppress the situation and arrest the road workers who caused the trouble.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Expanding the Promotion of Purebred Rice</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government believes that the promotion of purebred rice seeds this year has achieved great results, and this autumn has been a bumper harvest. In order to continue to promote it next spring, a meeting of district chiefs in the urban area was convened at 9:00 AM on the 16th to discuss the promotion methods. As a result, the area was expanded from 1,200 mu to 2,500 mu. The locations are in the Hushu and West Lake districts. The funds will be provided by the municipal government at 1,500 yuan to establish an agricultural promotion area. Wu Qiu, the director of the Social Affairs Section, will also serve as the director of the area and be responsible for everything.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Regulating the Exchange Rate of Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>In Ci County, businesses often arbitrarily change the exchange rate of silver and copper subsidiary coins. In some cases, one yuan of legal tender is only exchanged for 280 copper coins, and silver dimes are exchanged for 47 copper coins. Such violations of orders for profit not only disrupt the financial system but also affect the market. In order to unify the exchange rate in accordance with the law, the county government specially instructed the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday to separately instruct the exchange shops and strictly prohibit such behavior in order to strengthen the law.</p>
<h3>Six Die in Fire at Tao Gong Mountain</h3>
<p>Lu Xinquan, a resident of the Lu family in Taogong Mountain, Yindong, inherited a considerable fortune from his father. Xinquan's wife is deceased, leaving behind a son named Zhaocai, who is only eight years old. However, at around 1:00 AM on the 14th, for some unknown reason, his house suddenly caught fire. Xinquan was exhausted from militia training and was fast asleep. He did not wake up until the stairs were burned. He quickly searched for his stepmother (64 years old) and his son Zhaocai, but could not find them. The fire was already imminent. He had no choice but to jump down from the flames to escape, which severely injured his feet. His stepmother and son were both buried in the fire. By the time the nearby fire brigade arrived, all eight rooms of the building had been reduced to ashes, with losses exceeding 10,000 gold.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Red Pills Seized on the Water</h3>
<p>When the Yaobei ship, which operates between Yong and Ding, arrived in the town from Yong on the 13th, the police officers of the Water Public Security Bureau immediately boarded the ship for inspection. 2,800 red pills were found on a passenger named Zhang Axiang. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation. The suspect firmly denied it, saying that he was asked to keep it by a passenger whose name he did not know. The bureau temporarily detained him for investigation based on his confession.</p>

<h3>Meeting of Banks Such as the Bank of Communications to Handle Hunan Rice Transportation to Guangdong Mortgage and Exchange; Total Loan Amount Set at 10 Million Yuan; Entrusted to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to Handle</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that Yu Jiechuan, Director of the Construction Department of Hunan Province, in view of the bumper harvest of Hunan rice this year, requested the assistance of Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, to promote sales in Guangdong Province. Tang sent Deputy General Manager Li Zhongchu to accompany Director Yu to Guangdong for investigation. They agreed that transporting Hunan rice to Guangdong was the only way to sell it, and returned to Changsha together to negotiate everything. The bank will handle the Hunan rice transportation to Guangdong mortgage and exchange. However, because the amount of the mortgage and exchange is too large, it is necessary to jointly handle it with other banks. After Deputy General Manager Li returned to Shanghai, he contacted various banks.</p>
<p>Meeting Method of Banks Such as the Bank of Communications</p>
<p>Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, convened a meeting at the Bank of China at 2:00 PM on the 13th, inviting banks such as Shanghai, Guomin, Jincheng, Guohua, China Farmers Bank, and the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau to discuss matters related to the Hunan rice transportation to Guangdong mortgage and exchange. Zhu Runsheng, Qu Jigang, Zou Bingwen, Li Zhongchu, and others attended. It was decided to set the total amount of mortgage and exchange at 10 million yuan, which will be recognized by various banks. If necessary, it can be increased by 15 million yuan. In order to save expenses, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are entrusted to handle it, and a banking syndicate will not be organized separately. As for the articles of association, etc., they will be drafted by the Bank of Communications.</p>
<p>Entrusted to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to Handle</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the banking community about the mortgage and exchange method. When the seller transports the goods to the designated location, they will submit the bill of lading, insurance policy, invoice, etc. to the bank that is doing the mortgage and exchange to obtain the funds. After the goods arrive at the destination, the buyer will return the funds to the bank and obtain the bill of lading to pick up the goods. As for the handling of Hunan rice transportation to Guangdong mortgage and exchange by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the interest rate is said to be eight li. The second meeting of various banks will decide this. However, the amount recognized by each bank, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications being the most, is still under negotiation. It is decided to entrust the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to handle it and not form a separate banking syndicate.</p>

<h3>Twenty American Warships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Planned to Stay for Two Weeks and Then Sail to the Philippines; There Are Now Forty-Two Foreign Warships in the Huangpu River; Setting the Highest Record in History</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 AM yesterday morning, twenty American warships sailed from Qingdao and arrived here one after another, mooring in the Huangpu River. Together with the foreign warships that had previously arrived in Shanghai, the total number reached as many as forty-one, setting the highest record for foreign warships mooring in the Huangpu River. Among them, there were 27 American warships. The American warships that arrived in Shanghai yesterday plan to stay in Shanghai for two weeks and then sail to the Philippines. This joint voyage to Shanghai has nothing to do with the current situation. It is because the United States Far East Fleet is required to come to Shanghai once every spring and autumn. The names of the twenty American warships that arrived yesterday are listed below. It is also reported that all the ships of the United States Asiatic Fleet arrived in Shanghai almost entirely yesterday afternoon, totaling seventeen large and small warships, carrying thousands of sailors. Led by the Black Hawk, followed by destroyers and submarines, all came from North China. The submarines will sail to the Philippines within two weeks, and the remaining ships will stay in Shanghai until early November, while the flagship of the fleet, the沃格斯太 (Wokesitai), will go to Manila and then go to the Australian waters for winter cruising. Today, in addition to the 24 American warships in the port, there are also 15 warships from other countries, so the total number reaches as many as 39. Among the warships of other countries, three belong to France, three to the United States, eight to Japan, and one to Italy, which can be described as the most prosperous time.</p>

<h3>Dismissal Trend Occurs in Taikoo’s New Peking Steamer Tea Room, Out of 161 Tea Room Staff, the Shipping Company Only Agrees to Retain 65</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the British Taikoo Company’s New Peking Steamer has always sailed on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. At the end of last year, the company authorities, considering the age of the ship's hull, stopped the route for the sake of passenger safety. In February of this year, the route was opened and the steamer, formerly named Tongzhou, was renamed New Peking to take over the route. Now, a dismissal trend has suddenly occurred in the tea room of the steamer. A reporter from Datong News Agency recorded the situation in detail:</p>
<p>Reduction in Quota</p>
<p>The New Peking Steamer has 161 tea room staff (the company's quota is only 100), all under the command of Zheng Renye, the ship's purser. Since February of this year, when the steamer was renamed New Peking from Tongzhou and took over the route, because the Tongzhou steamer's hull was smaller than the New Peking steamer, the company authorities ordered the original quota of 100 tea room staff to be reduced to 65. At that time, all the tea room staff, upon hearing the news, felt that the lives of many would be in dire straits, and appealed to the Seamen's Union. After the union negotiated with Zheng Renye, the ship's purser, the reduction was postponed.</p>
<p>Occurence of Turmoil</p>
<p>Recently, the steamer brought up the matter of reducing the number of tea room staff again. Although the Seamen's Union repeatedly negotiated, the shipping company's attitude was firm and two solutions were proposed: (1) The number of tea room staff would be reduced to 65, and those to be retained would be determined by lottery; (2) The dismissed tea room staff would be given severance pay. However, the tea room staff did not agree to the above solutions and organized an office on the third floor of the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, and elected Chu Chunrong, Wan Sanxi, Wang Qingxiang, Song Baoru, Zhang Shide, etc. as representatives to negotiate with the shipping company and continue to appeal to the Seamen's Union.</p>

<h3>Movements of Japanese Troops Yesterday and the Day Before Yesterday, Field Exercises in Yangshupu the Day Before Yesterday, Increased Posts on North Sichuan Road Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at around 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, about 500 to 600 armed Japanese soldiers, divided into more than ten military vehicles, went to the Yangshupu area to conduct field exercises. They returned to the barracks after about two hours. Yesterday morning, the situation in the North Sichuan Road area was very quiet. Only occasional Japanese patrols patrolled the streets. The number of patrols entering the city area had decreased compared to yesterday. However, in the afternoon, from Lao Baizi Road along North Sichuan Road to Shigaota Road, the number of Japanese troops stationed suddenly increased, almost one post every ten steps. Residents felt quite uneasy. Sailors from various Japanese warships landed unarmed at 2:00 PM and toured the North Sichuan Road area. Japanese soldiers were also seen in the Toyota Spinning Factory on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, but the situation was still peaceful.</p>

<h3>Council of Directors of the China Tea Association to Review Qualifications of New Members, Decided to Continue the Congress Starting Next Monday, Pass Resolutions That Have Been Reviewed and Approved</h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the China Tea Association's annual meeting, which was suspended due to disputes over the issue of new members, has been resolved through mediation by party and government agencies. After the board of directors reviews the qualifications of the new members, the congress will reconvene. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, Director-General Zhu Zhenhuan of the board of directors reviewed the qualifications of the new members at the Yangzhuang Tea Trade Association in Gujialong. Because the new members are all shareholders or managers of tea shops and tea firms, their qualifications were not a problem and were all approved. However, those whose membership procedures were not complete were ordered to complete them. It was decided that after all the new members complete the procedures, the congress will continue. The date of the congress has been set for next Monday. The location and time will be notified temporarily by the presidium later. It is a good phenomenon for the tea industry that new and old members will connect, research, and jointly seek the development of the tea industry. In addition, Ye Shichang, chairman of the Yangzhuang Tea Trade Association, told reporters from New Voice News Agency yesterday that the members of this association are part of the association members, and have always taken the opinions of the majority of members as their opinions. Therefore, they have never wanted to arbitrarily express their views to the outside world. However, yesterday's newspaper reported that I, as part of the presidium meeting, requested to supplement the review of the qualifications of new members, and that this association should estimate how many directors there should be, etc., are not facts. The review of new members was transferred by the presidium to the board of directors for supplementation, not a personal request. Also, this association's desire to fight for an additional director, the director is produced by the members. There are still problems with the current members, how can we talk about directors? I am sincerely afraid that misunderstandings will occur to the outside world, so I specially correct this.</p>

<h3>Zhuanqiao Prepares for the 8th Plowing Cattle Competition, Improving Cattle Breeds and Increasing Efficiency, Cracking Down on Slaughtering Cattle and Forcing Cattle to Mate</h3>
<p>The Zhuanqiao area in West Shanghai holds a plowing cattle competition every year to improve plowing cattle and increase work efficiency. Since its inception, it has been held seven times. Many provinces and counties have imitated it. According to Zhang Ji, the person in charge of the plowing cattle competition, the third plowing cattle competition is currently being prepared. This year, cattle in various parts of suburban Shanghai have developed diseases (similar to foot-and-mouth disease), so holding the plowing cattle competition is even more necessary. In the future, the inspection of cattle physique will be carried out by the Animal Husbandry Improvement Promotion Association, while the affairs of the competition will be undertaken by the Zhuanqiao Township Improvement Association, the Shanghai Suburban Improvement Association, and the Tongqiao Improvement Association. The Zhuanqiao area is connected to Shanghai. Every late autumn, Shanghai cattle merchants flock to the interior to buy strong plowing cattle for slaughter, resulting in a decline in cattle breeds. It has already been submitted to the municipal and county governments for strict crackdown. On the one hand, we are raising funds to purchase excellent bulls and establish mating stations to force mating. The Ministry of Industry is paying close attention to this, and this measure is not difficult to succeed. Zhang also said that the rural sideline industry in the Zhuanqiao area is mainly weaving and raising chickens. In the future, we plan to advocate raising dairy cows and open up sources of profit, while Shen Wancheng runs the Shengsheng Pasture, and the results are very good. Farmers' interest in raising dairy cows has also arisen.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Yuan Zhengdao Determines that Blood Transfusion is an Improper Act, Drawing Blood is More Serious Than Oral Sex</h3>
<p>A crucial question of whether blood transfusion is illegal or not, Lawyer Yuan Zhengdao had previously requested the local bar association to forward the explanation, which was already handed over to the executive committee of the bar association for review, which has already been reported in the previous newspaper. Here is an excerpt from the additional reasons for the application submitted by Lawyer Yuan, which legal scholars should also study: According to Article 22 of the Criminal Law, lawful acts in the course of business are not punishable. The so-called lawful act, in terms of the medical profession, is the implementation of a lawful surgery when necessary for the patient's own benefit. For example, surgery for acute appendicitis is not punishable, but if the disease is not appendicitis, and attention is not paid, resulting in death, then the person is still liable for negligent homicide. Blood transfusion is to save one person on the one hand, but harms another person on the other hand. It is known that drawing blood will certainly result in harm, and blood transfusion may not immediately have the benefit of saving a life. If it is said that this kind of behavior belongs to what is proper, then comparing drawing blood with oral sex, which is lighter and which is heavier? In fact, there is no shortage of cases where the condition is critical and doctors advocate sucking the semen of others to save a life. If a newspaper advertisement is immediately posted, offering money to solicit volunteers to sell their semen to be sucked by patients, it is illegal and unreasonable, and cannot be regarded as a proper act. Moreover, drawing blood is even more serious than oral sex. Harming one person's health is a small matter, but causing harm to the entire race is of utmost importance. The defender said that the loss of the person whose blood is drawn is limited, and can be restored with a little rest. However, in fact, it has been determined that blood transfusion can indeed maintain the health of the patient. Conversely, the health of the person whose blood is drawn is of course seriously harmed. Moreover, the criminal law determines the degree of crime based on the result at the time of implementation. As for whether it can be restored afterwards, it is not a question of law. Some people may take this as a charitable act. Alas, using the blood of the poor as a tonic for the rich, soliciting with money, and making a big profit in the process, can this be considered charitable? (omitted below)</p>

It shall be calculated from the date of ticket sale. Passengers may take the train on any day within the validity period, but must still complete the journey before 24:00 on the last day of the validity period. However, if the passenger is unable to take the train on the date of ticket sale, they must present the ticket to the departure station for a new date of travel to be stamped when boarding"; (3) Attachment (3), Article 4 adds paragraph 3: "The validity period of a sightseeing round-trip ticket shall be calculated from the date of ticket sale. Passengers may take the train on any day within the validity period, but must still complete the journey before 24:00 on the last day of the validity period. However, if the passenger is unable to take the train on the date of ticket sale, they must present the ticket to the departure station for a new date of travel to be stamped when boarding"; (4) Attachment (4), Article 4 is amended to read: "The validity period of a domestic travel ticket shall be limited to two months, calculated from the date of ticket sale. Passengers may take the train on any day within the validity period, but must still complete the journey before 24:00 on the last day of the validity period.

<h3>Shanghai Fisheries Syndicate Prepares to Start Lending, Xinhua and Other Three Banks Jointly Pledge 120,000 Yuan, Continues to Seek Participation from Other Banks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to alleviate the fisheries and support production, has decided to organize a fisheries syndicate. The Executive Yuan has approved the organization outline, stipulating that the capital be 1 million yuan, of which 200,000 yuan is allocated by the Ministry of Industry, and the banking community is invited to participate. The Ministry has appointed Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Huang Yanfang to be responsible for the preparation. It has been a long time since then. According to reporters from New News Agency, the syndicate has been delayed until now due to the large amount of capital stipulated, which is difficult to raise for a while. However, fish merchants and fishermen are in urgent need of funds for turnover. The Fish Market Council has allocated funds to circulate, while Qian, Wang, and Huang are still actively preparing. Now, in order to implement the alleviation of the fisheries as soon as possible, it is proposed to change the method. Xinhua Bank, Four Banks Savings Association, and Zhonghui Bank will each contribute 40,000 yuan, totaling 120,000 yuan, and proceed with the actual operation. The remaining insufficient amount will continue to be sought from other banks to participate in the organization. The plan has been submitted to Minister Wu Dingchang for instructions, and it is planned to start the lending in the near future. The term, interest, and all borrowing procedures have been drafted by the three and submitted to the Ministry for adoption. Once the Ministry approves, it will be implemented.</p>

<h3>Murder Case Occurs in the Dormitory of the Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau, Zhang Ruifang Beaten to Death Because the Noodle Soup Was Not Hot</h3>
<p>Zhang Ruifang, a worker at the Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau, 22 years old, from Shaoxing, was assigned to serve in the staff dormitory (the dormitory is located behind the East Market in Beiqiao Town). At 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, Sun Yannian, an official of the bureau, 23 years old, from Anhui, and his brother Sun Yonghua, 20 years old, who were living in the dormitory, ordered Zhang to reheat the noodle soup because they felt it was not hot.

<h3>Using a Fake Diploma to Practice Medicine: Wang Jingbo Convicted, Similar to the Chen Bingwei Case, Fined 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wang Jingbo, a 42-year-old man from Anhui, studied medicine in Japan in the past. Due to economic difficulties, he returned to China before graduating. He entrusted his friend Zhang Zhenru to fraudulently obtain a diploma from Tokyo Medical College in Japan and set up clinics at No. 1568 Avenue Edward VII and No. 7 Mao Yi Lane, Shanhai Road, to treat patients. In May of this year, Wang presented the diploma to the Executive Yuan’s Department of Health to obtain a license, but it was verified with Tokyo Medical College in Japan that the diploma was forged. The Department of Health sent a letter to the Special Court for investigation. The Special Court and the Xinzha Police Station dispatched detectives to arrest Wang Jingbo and detain him in the Special Court. These events have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Police Station Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted Wang for continuous fraud under Article 329, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, stating that the defendant's crime was similar to the previous case of doctor Chen Bingwei being sued for continuous fraud. Chen Bingwei also claimed to be a Doctor of Medicine and practiced medicine in Shanghai for ten years, but was later found by the police station to have no medical qualifications and was reported. The preliminary trial declared him innocent, but after the police station appealed, the court ruled on December 18 of last year that Chen was guilty of continuous fraud against patients and fined him 200 yuan. The situation in this case is similar, and the same judgment should be requested, he said. The defendant, Wang Jingbo, admitted that the certificate was fraudulently obtained by a friend and hired two lawyers to handle the case. Judge Fu then sentenced Wang Jingbo to using a forged certificate, sufficient to harm the public, and fined him 200 yuan. If he chooses to perform labor in lieu of the fine, it will be calculated at 3 yuan per day. The forged certificate was confiscated. During the appeal period, bail was set for his release, and he was allowed to suspend detention. Before the bail bond was submitted, the defense lawyers were allowed to bail him out.</p>
<h3>Wang Binyan's Criminal Complaint: Lu Xingyuan Case Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the 23rd</h3>
<p>In September of last year, the Guangdong Bank, a British merchant bank that had ceased operations, filed a lawsuit because Wang Dong (alias Binyan), a Shanghai gentleman, had mortgaged real estate in 1924, during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, for a loan of 10,000 taels of silver, which was overdue. After three trials, Wang was ordered to repay the principal and interest. However, Wang claimed that the loan was used to maintain local order at the time and should be repaid by the government, so he did not comply with the final judgment. In March of this year, the bank submitted a request to the court to seal up the mortgaged property. At the same time, they appointed lawyer Lu Xingyuan to publish a notice in the Xinbao newspaper, detailing the history of the mortgage dispute. After reading the notice, Wang believed that the wording in the notice damaged his reputation and prevented the government from repaying the more than 186,000 yuan he had advanced. He hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint of defamation against Zhang Rongpu, manager of the Guangdong Bank, and lawyer Lu Xingyuan, in the First Special District Court, along with a civil lawsuit seeking compensation for the advanced funds of more than 20,860,000 yuan, and compensation for his personal losses of 5,000 yuan per year for ten years, totaling 50,000 yuan. A hearing had already been held, with only Lu Xingyuan appearing in court. Lu Xingyuan filed a counterclaim against Wang, requesting that he be punished for false accusation. The court ordered Wang and Zhang to be summoned for further questioning, as reported in previous issues. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo continued the hearing. Both plaintiffs and defendants appeared in court. Zhang Rongpu also filed a counterclaim against Wang Binyan for false accusation. In court, Wang Binyan testified that when the Guangdong Bank applied to the court to execute the mortgage on the property, he did not resist. However, three days after the sealing, Lu Xingyuan, representing the bank, published a notice stating that the loan was not used for maintaining local order, but had other purposes, which was insinuating and caused great damage to my reputation. Those who could help me now do not trust me very much. Since the defendant claims it was insinuating, he should be ordered to present evidence. Although the notice was signed by the Guangdong Bank, Zhang Rongpu is the manager of the bank and should be responsible, he said. Defendant Zhang Rongpu testified that the Guangdong Bank suspended operations on September 4 of last year, following the Hong Kong headquarters, and he resigned on the 11th of that month. Since then, all matters of the bank have been managed by Reiner, appointed by the British Court in Shanghai. Therefore, he did not know about the publication of the notice. However, Wang’s mortgage loan was negotiated with him back then, but he did not ask about the purpose. Now, since August 15, all assets of the bank have been entrusted to him for safekeeping, and he is preparing to resume operations, he said. Lu Xingyuan testified that the loan was made in 1924, while the contract for advance funds between Wang Dong, representing the defense corps, and Han Guojun, the Jiangsu Military Rehabilitation Supervisor, was made in 1925. Moreover, when Wang borrowed money from the bank, he used his individual name and did not mention that the funds were for public use. Therefore, the Supreme Court's judgment did not recognize that the loan was used to maintain local order. However, during the execution, a group came forward to interfere, so the bank's Westerner, Tanna, instructed me to draft a notice for publication. Therefore, the motive for publishing the notice was to hope that outsiders would not interfere with the court's execution and the bank's creditor's rights. The wording of the notice was very vague and did not affirm any insinuation by the plaintiff. The meaning of the text is very clear. Perhaps the plaintiff's mind is not clear, and the mind of his agent is also not clear. The reason why the Guangdong Bank went bankrupt was because debtors did not repay their debts. How could the plaintiff demand compensation for losses? In theory, he should compensate the bank for its losses, he said. The plaintiff then recounted his hard work in maintaining order in Zhabei during previous wars. After further arguments between the plaintiff's lawyer and the defendant, Judge Dai announced that the judgment would be delivered on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month.</p>

<h3>Korean Attempts to Smuggle Silk into China to Evade Taxes: Russian Scams a Large Sum: Result: Taxes Paid According to Regulations: Russian Arrested by Detectives</h3>
<p>Russian Pyotr B. Knesh, residing at No. 45 Beihai Ning Road, learned between April 25 and June 9 of this year that Korean Hae Kou (Chinese name Shuang Jiong-bai) would transport a large quantity of rayon to China. He impersonated a customs secretary, claiming that he could arrange to avoid customs duties, but required 10,000 yuan. A contract was signed at the time. However, when Hae Kou transported the silk to China, it was seized by customs, and taxes were paid according to regulations. Later, Hae Kou sued Pyotr to the police station for fraud. The other day, Deputy Detective Babe Ning of the Police Station arrested Pyotr at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Police Station Lawyer Qian Xun-jiu requested a postponement because the case had not yet been clarified. After a brief interrogation by Judge Pan Zhen-yang, he ordered a postponement for further questioning. It is heard that Pyotr, on the one hand, discussed tax evasion with Hae, and on the other hand, reported it to the customs to receive a huge reward.</p>

<h3>Extortion Against Yuan Ludeng and Le Zhenbao: Six Gangsters Arrested in the Jingsheng Hotel: Gang Members Gambling and Playing Mahjong Caught Red-Handed: Handgun, Bullets, and Extortion Letter Confiscated</h3>
<p>Lao Zha Police Station Chief Detective You A-gen, Detectives Feng Xiu-shan, Bao Detective Wu Shou-shan, Liu Shao-tian, and others learned that a gang of bandits was hiding in Room 25 of the Jingsheng Hotel, No. 5, Lane 267, Beihai Road. At 4 PM the other day, they rushed to arrest them fully armed. At that time, there were four people in the room: Liu Zhongliang (also known as Xiao Huang'e) from Ningbo, Tang Haigen, Ye Jinsheng (also known as A-Si), and Guo Yunyu (also known as Xiao Suzhou) from Shanghai, gambling and playing mahjong. They were all arrested. A handgun and six bullets were confiscated from Liu's side, and the bullets were already chambered. An extortion letter was also found in the room. The letter was addressed to Le Zhenbao, owner of the Taichang Furniture Company on Nanjing Road, under the name of the "Radical Plainclothes Group." The letter demanded 20,000 yuan. There was also a few cottons and two bullets in a Buy cigarette case. These bullets were intended to be sent to Le with the letter. They were all taken to the police station, and detectives were ordered to stay at the hotel. Soon, Qiu A-fu (also known as Xiao Er) from Haidou and Zhou Caiqing from Pudong came and were also arrested. It was found that in addition to planning to send a letter to Le Zhenbao to extort money, they had also sent a letter to Yuan Ludeng, trying to extort 10,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, they were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Presiding Judge Qian Hongye interrogated them. Police Station Lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated the case and said that all six suspects had previously been convicted of crimes. Qiu A-fu was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Second Special Court in July 1933 for a theft case, and his term has not yet expired. The court should investigate why he has been released from prison. Because the case still needs to be investigated, he asked that they be detained for a week. When questioned, Guo Yunyu confessed that a tall man with a high nose had come to my house with Qiu A-fu and Zhou Caiqing to ask if I knew of any wealthy families to rob. At that time, Qiu took out two handguns, which I refused. Yesterday, they came again to invite me to Jingsheng and forced me with a handgun to write an extortion letter, one to Le Zhenbao and one to Yuan Ludeng, which was sent by the tall man. Because Le's company did not accept it, it was returned. When questioned, the other suspects were evasive. After Judge Qian verified the confession, he ordered the defendants to be detained for another week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Mingshin Company Ceases Operations: Li Junying Sues Russian: Disregarding Losses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Film Department of Mingshin Company was jointly opened by Li Junying, who advanced 15,000 yuan, and Soviet Russian G. Sayaoiantz, specializing in Soviet Russian films. Due to the unpopularity of Soviet Russian films, business was poor, leading to the cessation of operations. Mr. G. Sayaoiantz ignored the loss, so Li Junying hired lawyer Cai Liu-cheng to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court of Shanghai. The defendant, G. Sayaoiantz, appeared in court yesterday, represented by lawyer Jiang Guo-fang. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the company's operating loss totaled 13,761.36 yuan. According to the contract, the defendant should share 8,944.88 yuan and should be ordered to compensate the plaintiff, he said. The defendant's lawyer requested a postponement, which was granted by the judge, and the continuation of the trial was scheduled for the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Teacher-Student Romance Fails to Last: Lawsuit for Seduction and Abandonment: Wu Yu Sues Ye Qinghua: Ye's Wife and Concubines Assault Wu</h3>
<p>Ye Qinghua, a Minnan native, the current Shanghai Xiamen Commercial Bank (now bankrupt and in liquidation) manager, aged 38, currently resides in a Western-style apartment at No. 115 Avenue du Père Robert in the French Concession. He is the younger brother of Ye Qinghe, the international drug trafficker and morphine king, who is wanted by the First Special District Court and is in hiding in Nanyang. He was a teacher at Jimei Middle School in Xiamen and had a teacher-student relationship with Wu Yu (aged 30), a woman from the same hometown. They began living together and had two daughters, the eldest named Ah Hua, aged six, and the youngest named Yu Hua, aged two, who was born on October 6 of last year at Guangren Hospital. The eldest daughter, Ah Hua, was taken by Ye and sent to a friend to raise. Recently, Ye abandoned Wu, so Wu Yu hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution against Ye Qinghua in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District for seduction and abandonment, and attached a civil lawsuit seeking living expenses, consolation money, and child support expenses totaling 30,000 yuan. According to the indictment, the plaintiff graduated from Jimei Middle School and came to Shanghai to study obstetrics at the Zhongde Hospital. The defendant, in his capacity as a teacher, often seduced her. In August 1932, the two married at the Great Shanghai Hotel on Ningbo Road and had a daughter, who was taken by the defendant and sent to a friend to raise. Last November, the defendant sent the plaintiff to Guangren Hospital to give birth to the daughter Yu Hua. After the marriage, the defendant accompanied the plaintiff to Xiamen to meet his elder brother Qinghe and formally greet him. After coming to Shanghai to live together, they often quarreled. The defendant burned the marriage certificate and committed various abuses. On May 17 of last year, he sent a letter to his elder brother Qinghe. Because Qinghe fled due to drug trafficking and his residence was secret, the plaintiff learned of his residence, which caused inconvenience. Therefore, he rebuked the defendant and ordered him to break away from the plaintiff. From then on, the defendant abandoned the plaintiff and her daughters, committing crimes under Articles 129, 293, and 294 of the Criminal Code, and requested an investigation. According to the complaint, for the sake of caution, Judge Zhang Chao-zuo first summoned the plaintiff Wu Yu to the court for investigation, and then issued a summons on the 13th of this month, sending a bailiff with the plaintiff to summon the defendant, scheduling a court hearing for yesterday (the 16th). When the bailiff delivered the summons to the defendant's place, the defendant was out, so it was not received. At 2 PM that afternoon, the plaintiff Wu Yu went to visit her friend Xu Wang-shan-yu at the Dacheng Apartment, No. 33 Bubbling Well Road. Ye Qinghua's wife, Yang Zhu-xia, and a woman named Chen Rong rushed to Dacheng Apartment and assaulted Wu Yu. Wu took the opportunity to escape and hired a car to report to the police station. When she arrived at the intersection of Rue de la Pompe and Avenue Joffre, she was caught up and assaulted again. The patrolmen saw this and escorted the two women, Yang and Chen, into the Avenue Joffre Police Station. After questioning by the chief patrolman, the two women, Yang and Chen, were each fined one yuan and released with a reprimand. Wu Yu was injured and pregnant and admitted herself to the hospital set up by the Jiangwan Hai Health Bureau for treatment. She then filed another complaint with the Second Special District Court, criminally prosecuting Ye Qinghua for inciting his wife and concubines, Yang Zhuxia and Chen Rong, to commit assault, requesting that personnel be sent to the hospital to verify the injuries and handle the matter according to law. The next day (the 14th), Ye made the excuse of surrendering himself to the bailiff's office of the Second Special District Court in Nanjing and received the summons.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the court hearing on Wu Yu's self-accusation against Ye Qinghua for offenses against morality and abandonment, Judge Xin presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Wu Yu, was unable to appear in court due to her serious injuries and ongoing treatment. Her agent, lawyer Mao Feng-wu, attended on her behalf and stated the intention of the self-accusation. The defendant, Ye Qinghua, attended court with his defense lawyer and admitted that he had a relationship with the plaintiff and had broken off the relationship. He denied that he had children with the plaintiff or sent them to others to raise. The court also summoned bailiff No. 31 to question him about the events of the 13th, when he accompanied the plaintiff to summon the defendant. The defendant stated that he was going to Nanjing and returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 13th. He learned that his wife had been assaulted by the plaintiff and that he had not instigated his wife to call someone to commit the assault. After verifying the confession, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning because the plaintiff had not arrived.</p>

<h3>Bao Cheng Exchange Shop: Three Robbers Arrested: Exchanging Stolen Silver Coins for Legal Tender: Reported to the Central Bank for Arrest</h3>
<p>The Bao Cheng Exchange Shop at No. 584 Sichuan Road was suddenly invaded by a number of robbers at 1:40 PM on the 11th of this month, who robbed banknotes, auxiliary coins, and miscellaneous silver coins, totaling 3,350 yuan. The case was reported to the police station for investigation. The police station notified all banks that if anyone came to exchange miscellaneous silver coins for cash, they should notify them immediately. At 10:15 AM on the morning of the other day, Wang Zheng-ji from Hangzhou, Huang A-ying from Ningbo, and Fang Quan-gui brought 3,657 miscellaneous silver coins to the Central Bank at No. 15 The Bund to exchange for legal tender. The bank notified the General Police Station, which immediately ordered Chinese Detective Yang Pei-sheng, Detective Song Yuan-shan, and Bao Detective Mao Yun-long to rush to the scene and arrest the three suspects, Wang, Huang, and Fang. Zhao Hong-sheng, manager of the Bao Cheng Exchange Shop, and partners Sun Bing-chen and Xia Dong-zhou came to identify them. Zhao and others pointed out that Wang and others were indeed the robbers. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police Station Lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated that the three suspects had been identified by the plaintiff and had previously been sentenced to prison for theft cases by the court for seven, eight, and five years, respectively. Therefore, he requested that they be detained for further investigation of the remaining gang members. When questioned, Wang and Huang confessed to the robbery of the Bao Cheng Exchange Shop without hesitation, while Fang denied it. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered them to be detained for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Liuyang Firecrackers Increase in Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Firecracker Industry Association has raised the selling price since yesterday due to the drying up of the Yangtze River and the scarcity of goods. The notice sent to each sales outlet says: "We are writing to inform you that the price of Liuyang firecrackers from our industry has recently risen sharply in the producing areas. In addition, since the autumn, the Yangtze River has dried up, and freight costs have increased. The cost of transshipment to Shanghai has increased. Therefore, in order to maintain the cost, colleagues have had no choice but to slightly increase the original selling price. It has been jointly decided that from October 15 of the Gregorian calendar, the wholesale prices will be sold at a 30% discount from the original marked price. In addition to printing and distributing separate notices, we are afraid that we have not informed everyone, so we have published a notice in the newspaper as above. We hope that all sales outlets will check and take note."</p>
<h3>Hart Road: A Jew Murdered – Valuables Untouched, Seeming a Revenge Killing</h3>
<p>Number 57, Lane 667, Hart Road, was rented by a Mr. Yao. On September 1st of this year, a Jew named David Hessler arrived and rented the premises, claiming he sold sweets and candies. Mr. Yao, finding the house vacant, rented it out to him. They lived peacefully for over a month. Unexpectedly, around 6 a.m. yesterday morning, when Mrs. Fang, Mr. Yao's wife, got up to wash and was sweeping the lane, she suddenly saw the door of Room 57 wide open and found David lying on the ground, already dead, blood staining the area around his body. Extremely frightened, she rushed to Gordon Road Police Station to report the incident. Police detectives were dispatched to investigate and discovered that the deceased had six or seven stab wounds on his chest and abdomen, all in vital areas, leading to his death. A murder weapon was left near the body. Two suitcases and 500 silver dollars were found in the deceased's room, untouched. Therefore, the case was deemed not a robbery. Detectives conducted an on-site inspection and took the items back to the police station. An investigation was initiated to determine if the deceased was related to Mr. Tazell Hessler, a Jewish manager at the New Consolidated Cotton Mills. After inquiries, Mr. Tazell stated that he did not know the deceased. With no leads, the police are working hard to investigate and rigorously pursue the perpetrator. The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that around 7 a.m. this morning (the 16th), a Chinese coolie passing Hart Road noticed the door of a house ajar and no one around. Looking inside, he saw a corpse lying on the ground and reported it to the nearby patrol officer. The officer entered the house, investigated briefly, and reported to Gordon Road Police Station. A Western officer was dispatched for a detailed investigation. The house was Number 57. The corpse was lying in a pool of blood. Everything inside was in order, with no signs of a struggle. The corpse had knife wounds on the head and arms, inflicted by a cleaver. The skull was smashed with a hammer. The weapons were next to the corpse. The blood had congealed, indicating the crime occurred last night. The deceased was an Iraqi Jew, about 50 years old. He did not have a formal British passport, so his nationality and jurisdiction were uncertain. The British Consulate's coroner will temporarily examine the body. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>A Suicide by Drowning: Letter Requesting Corpse Retrieval – Many Suspicious Points in the Letter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tongren Fuyuan Hall is a charitable organization that manages the collection and burial of unclaimed corpses found on the streets and in the water. Previously, its branch halls had received several letters claiming suicides by drowning, which were forwarded to the Life Saving Bureau but no bodies were ever recovered. Yesterday, the hall received a letter delivered by the post office, purportedly from a Zhou Xiaobao in this city, claiming suicide by drowning and requesting the retrieval and burial of his body. The letter stated, "To the esteemed gentlemen in charge, this month's twentieth night is the last day for me, Zhou Xiaobao, and the anniversary of my joining the waves. The location of my suicide will be approximately in the Huangpu River near the Bund Park. I request that you order some workers to wait at the aforementioned location and kindly retrieve my body for a hasty burial. I resort to this desperate measure due to incautious friendships and self-disrespect. After receiving my letter, I would be grateful if you could publish it widely in newspapers, so that those who know the name Zhou Xiaobao may have some reflections. This is my lifelong request. Wishing you peace. Written by Zhou Xiaobao." The writing was sophisticated and elegant, but the date of the supposed drowning mentioned in the letter was four days prior to the date the hall received the letter, seeming as though he had premeditated the date of suicide. It is either a novel approach to suicide by drowning, or something else is happening. The hall forwarded the letter to the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau, instructing the life saving boat to pay attention. However, the letter did not describe the appearance or clothing of the suicide victim, which is another point of suspicion.</p>
<h3>City Government Commends Enthusiastic Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The *Shen Shi Bao* reports that Mr. Lu Guanshou, owner of the Shanghai China Glass Factory, and Mr. Cui Dechen, owner of the Beiyang Glass Factory, successively donated funds to purchase fire engines and donate them to the Zhabei Section Four Fire Brigade, benefiting the local area. The fire brigade submitted a request to the Public Safety Bureau to have the municipal government issue plaques of commendation to encourage them. It is now known that the municipal government has issued plaques to Lu Guanshou with the inscription "Ren Ze Pu Zhan" (Benevolence Widely Bestowed) and to Cui Dechen with the inscription "Hui Ze Yuan Yang" (Grace Far Reaching), and ordered the Public Safety Bureau to deliver them separately.</p>

<h3>The Perpetrator Who Killed Two and Injured One: Yang Chunyi Sentenced to Life Imprisonment – Yang Kai Knelt and Begged After the Verdict – Judge Said He Had Already Been Lenient</h3>
<p>Zhang Longhai, a letter carrier at the city center post office, was shot to death on the evening of July 15th of this year, at approximately 8 p.m., at his residence at No. 131 Jiangwan Riverbank West Road, when Yang Chunyi, a police officer in this city, broke in through the front door and shot Zhang with a handgun. At the same time, he shot and killed Zhang's lover, Shen Cuie. Shen Cuie's sister, Shen Sifang, was also shot and injured, but did not die. Yang Chunyi fled after the murders and was apprehended near Bengbu. The incident occurred because Yang was previously involved with Shen Cuie and later became involved with Zhang Longhai, including the sister. Yang Chunyi, jealous and angered, committed the murders. After escaping, he could not forget Shen Sifang and sent her letters of comfort, which led to his arrest. After being brought to Shanghai, he was sent to the local court. Prosecutor Deng filed a public prosecution. After a trial in the Criminal Court, the defendant confessed without denying anything and requested leniency. Therefore, the case was quickly clarified. The judge indicated that the debate was concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court in the Criminal Division Five to announce the verdict. He ordered the bailiff to bring Yang Chunyi to the case. He stated that the defendant was 32 years old, from Nansuzhou, Anhui, and previously served as a police officer in the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau. At this point, the judge read out the main text of the verdict: Yang Chunyi is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and permanently deprived of his civil rights. Yang knelt on the ground and begged for mercy. The judge stated that since you killed two people, today's verdict is already a lenient one. If you are not satisfied, you can appeal. He then ordered him to be taken back into custody.</p>

<h3>"Dianjing" Lamps Imitate "Baoan" Lamps – Infringing Patent Rights – Zhu Jianlin et al. Sue Gao Yushan – For Copying Technical Methods and Counterfeiting</h3>
<p>Zhu Jianlin from Nanhui, together with Liu Ziyi from Shandong, spent over three years of effort researching and inventing a type of "Yaoshui" battery-powered "Baoan" safety lamp. In November of last year, they applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for patent registration according to law. After the Industrial Awards Technology Committee reviewed and approved it, they were granted a five-year patent, which was publicly announced. Zhu and others then established the Huayi Industrial Society in Yongping Lane, Maignan Road, in the Public Concession, planning factory foundations, procuring machinery, and actively proceeding. Unexpectedly, the "Dianjing" lamps of the Guangming "Dianjing" Lamp Factory appeared. Zhu Jianlin discovered that the Guangming "Dianjing" lamps were counterfeiting the "Baoan" lamps. He then cited human and physical evidence of various illegal combinations by Guangming's manager Gao Yushan and initiator Wu Zhile, and of using the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's public announcement to steal technical methods. He hired lawyer Zou Shengzu to represent him in filing a criminal self-accusation in the Second Special District Court against Gao Yushan and Wu Zhile for copying technical methods, counterfeiting and issuing goods, and infringing patent rights. He requested the court to prosecute them and seal up the factory, confiscate unissued counterfeit goods, etc. Based on the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, had Judge Zhang Minsheng come to Criminal Division Two to subpoena and question them. First, the plaintiff Zhu Jianlin recounted the previous events and stated that the methods invented by the merchants were announced by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the second defendant, Wu Zhile, copied the recipe and joined the first defendant, Gao Yushan, in a partnership. Wu was the supervisor and Gao was the manager, implementing the counterfeiting, etc. The defendant Wu Zhile did not appear. Gao Yushan testified that he was 51 years old and lived at No. 1 Faxing Lane, Liyuan Road. He stated that the merchants invented the "Dianjing" lamp because, in 1934, a Japanese friend brought a "Dianjing" lamp from Japan and asked him to promote it. Therefore, the merchants were able to research the structure of the lamp and only succeeded in 1935. In May of this year, he entrusted a friend, Zhu Youbing, to promote it in the interior. He was asked if he would register it with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and replied, "No." He was asked, "Do you know if they (referring to the plaintiffs) have already registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce?" He replied, "I don't know." He was asked if his "Dianjing" lamp was the same as the lamp invented by the plaintiff, and he replied, "I don't know." The rest of his words were contradictory. After examining the testimony in court, the judge adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 20th for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Opium Smokers Obtain Travel Permits – Purchase and Smoke Government-Sold Opium Anywhere</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued instructions to the county governments of Shanghai and other counties yesterday, stating, "This province implemented opium prohibition relatively early. When registering opium smokers in 1934, other provinces and cities had not yet begun the process. Therefore, the former Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee issued Instruction No. 376, according to which opium smokers with permits traveling to other provinces and cities would not be issued travel permits. However, since 1935, all other provinces and cities, except for Nanjing City, the capital, have complied with the prohibition orders issued by the National Government Military Commission and implemented opium prohibition. All opium smokers who have registered and obtained permits have the freedom to travel for business. It is common for opium smokers from Province A to travel to Province B. If opium smokers from neighboring provinces are unable to obtain travel permits and are unable to purchase and smoke government-sold opium, they will inevitably purchase private opium for replenishment, which is not a prudent approach to opium prohibition. This outdated regulation should be abolished. Hereafter, opium smokers registered in this province traveling to other provinces and cities should obtain travel permits in accordance with Article 40 of the Opium and Drug Prohibition Implementation Regulations in order to legally purchase and smoke from local shops. Opium smokers from other provinces and cities traveling to this province, if they hold their own smoking cessation licenses and travel permits, should also be allowed to purchase and smoke legally from shops in their place of residence. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the county magistrates for compliance, and to be forwarded for compliance and public announcement. This order."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin and Chen Linchang – Neither Are Good People – Both Handed Over to Court for Questioning</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaolin from Haimen, at approximately 8 p.m. on the afternoon of the 14th of this month, along with his lover Li Wangshi, was walking near the intersection of Touba Road and Tiantong Road when they were surrounded by more than ten bandits who accused him of hiding drugs such as heroin and morphine. Unable to escape, he had a felt hat worth 12 yuan and 4 yuan in cash snatched away before the group fled. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Wang Debiao, Detective Wang Chonghao, and Chinese Constable No. 2027 arrived after hearing the alarm and apprehended a suspect named Chen Linchang from Ningbo. They took him to the Hongkou Police Station and searched him, but no stolen goods or money were found. He claimed that Zhang Xiaolin was selling drugs and had previously, in July of this year, organized a gang to rob residents on Hardoon Road, acting as a robber. Detective Wang then cooperated with a Western detective and rushed to search Qu's house at No. 5, Lane 144, Tongen Road. They found two letters sent to him by his mother-in-law from Zhenjiang, detailing that Xiao Mei and Bing Fang, two members of the robbery gang in a certain robbery case, had been detained, one for seven years and one for five years. Wei Muhai had escaped, and he was warned to be careful. There was indeed a relationship. Zhang was arrested and, together with the two letters and Chen, was sent to the Criminal Division Three of the First Special District Court yesterday morning on charges of robbery and highway robbery. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department explained the case, stating that Zhang Xiaolin had committed many robberies in the past and was released last June 14. Both defendants did not admit to the charges at the police station and requested an extension of the investigation. The letters were presented for inspection. Li Wangshi, Zhang's lover, pointed out that Chen Linchang had gathered more than ten people at the time and used the excuse of wanting to consume morphine to rob Zhang Xiaolin of 4 yuan in cash and a felt hat. She was also at the scene. After Judge Zhong Qing questioned the two defendants, their statements were evasive. They were ordered to be remanded in custody, and the hearing was rescheduled for clarification.</p>

<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>Wah Tat Double Coil Bulb's Special Features: Upon examination of the filament of electric light bulbs, initially manufactured in a long filament form, this type of filament was durable but consumed a lot of electricity. Later, it was modified into a circular coil filament, i.e., a single-layer spring filament bulb, which proved more effective than the long filament. As a result, long filament bulbs gradually disappeared from the market, almost entirely replaced by circular filament bulbs. Now, the renowned Wah Tat Bulb Factory, recognizing the effectiveness of circular filaments but aware of the risk of filament breakage upon vibration, has applied its scientific ingenuity to create a double-layer spring filament bulb, known as the double coil bulb. Since its introduction, it has been selling in large quantities. Its combined benefits include brightness, energy saving, durability, and resistance to damage from vibration. With so many advantages, it's no wonder that users welcome and enjoy it. This is truly a new contribution to domestically produced light bulbs.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Thread Prices Soar; Futures Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>The yarn market has experienced a setback due to profit-taking after the previous day's surge, leading to a sluggish market. However, actual yarn sales remain robust, with strong demand from Tianjin, inland areas, and Guangdong. The prices of 32s and 42s yarn from Qingdao have risen by around thirteen yuan. Consequently, Shanghai cotton prices have also jumped by ten yuan. Considering the current state of actual yarn, the future of the yarn market is unlikely to ease.</p>
<p>Profit-Taking by Bulls</p>
<p>In the forward yarn market, near-month contracts opened with strong momentum. Although floating accounts took profits, Yu Da single-handedly continued to buy, maintaining strong buying pressure, pushing prices up by five, six, or seven jiao. The third session was slightly weaker, but near-month contracts remained firm at the close. Distant-month contracts rose by several jiao. Market sentiment was unusually enthusiastic, with speculation that soaring thread prices in Qingdao (rising by over yuan) would inevitably lead to a corresponding increase in yarn prices. Da Feng, Guang Feng, Chang Feng, Run Kang, and others sold large quantities, while Heng Yi, Ju Xing, Yu Da, and Feng Tai also made significant purchases. As a result, prices for all months fell by three, four, or five jiao compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon session, near-month contracts were very firm, rising by six jiao. Distant-month contracts also rose by three to five jiao. In the second and third sessions, bulls took profits, causing a sudden drop of eight, nine jiao to one yuan three or four jiao. By the close, reports of strong actual yarn conditions and a continued rise in selling prices (up by two yuan) allowed near-month contracts to remain unchanged, while distant-month contracts rebounded by eight, nine jiao to one yuan. Ultimately, prices for all months fell by seven, eight jiao to one yuan one or two jiao compared to the morning close. Geng Feng sold 5,300 bales, Tong Ji 1,200 bales, He Xing 5,150 bales, Xing Chang 2,000 bales, Shen Ji 1,190 bales, Chang Feng 2,800 bales, Run Kang 4,900 bales, Sen Kang 2,000 bales, and Da Chang Cheng 4,000 bales.

The daily high and low prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Thread Prices Jump by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Actual yarn sales remain strong. Total purchases by various gangs for the day are estimated at 2,165 bales. Selling prices rose by two yuan, and thread prices rose by ten yuan. Purchase amounts by various gangs are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Suddenly Trends Downward; Recent US Cotton Performance Weak; Heavy Selling Pressure from Major Players</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weakening with a strong downward trend. The decline in English cotton October futures by 22 pounds sterling caused significant softness, and a major player exerted pressure with massive sell-offs. Run Kang, Yi Chang, and Tai Chang, all bullish, rushed to exit, intensifying the downward momentum. However, actual cotton conditions remain firm, with prices in various producing areas also remaining strong.</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Market Opens Lower and Continues to Decline</p>
<p>In the forward cotton market, the opening session saw prices rise due to the firm yarn market, as raw cotton naturally followed suit. Near-month contracts showed strong upward pressure, while distant-month contracts remained flat. Concerns arose due to the 22-pound decline in US cotton near-month futures. According to market reports, a certain cotton company and a certain cotton firm have sold short tens of thousands of dan, creating heavy pressure and a sluggish market. The second session saw a sudden decline of two, three, or four jiao. As yarn prices stabilized, there was a slight rebound. Geng Feng, Tai Chang, Yi Chang, Run Kang, Xin Cheng, Yuan Xing Chang, and others sold off large quantities, while Yu Da, De Da, Chang Yu, Shen Ji, Yuan Yi, Chang Feng, Yi Kang, Chang He, Fu Kang, and Da Chang made purchases. As a result, prices for all months fell by five fen to one jiao and a half compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session opened with a flat and sluggish market. Due to the large volumes offered by major players in the morning, the trading environment was loose and disorganized. After the second session, market prices opened lower and continued to decline. Most traders were pessimistic, and the decline was exacerbated by sell-offs from major players. Ultimately, prices for all months fell by another three jiao and a half to four jiao compared to the morning close. Heng Yi sold 6,300 dan, Geng Feng 14,600 dan, Tai Chang 14,500 dan, Yi Chang 4,600 dan, Run Kang 17,000 dan, Xin Cheng 12,400 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 3,100 dan, Fu Kang 3,200 dan.

The daily high and low prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Hedging of US Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with gains of four to seven points for all months. Today, a major firm engaged in large-scale hedging, and the public also engaged in selling. October contracts were particularly weak as the trading period ends tomorrow, prompting bulls to exit. Today's weather forecast predicts mostly cloudy conditions in the eastern US, with possible rain. In the central region, Arkansas will have good weather, while other regions will be mostly cloudy, with possible rain tonight.

<h3>Qingdao Yarn Market Highly Active</h3>
<p>Futures Soar, Temporarily Suspending Margin Calls (From Allied News Agency, Qingdao, 16th): At the Qingdao Exchange, the cotton yarn market saw the October futures contract open at 273 yuan, with a low of 272 yuan and a high of 274 yuan. Trading was suspended 15 minutes into the session. After the suspension, trading continued, with prices rising to 278 yuan by 10:00 AM. The soaring prices were attributed to concerns about the current situation, leading to increased short covering, coupled with scarce spot inventories and a bullish trend in the Shanghai market for several consecutive days, further strengthening the buying sentiment. After margin calls were imposed in the afternoon session, trading briefly resumed, with the October contract at 276 yuan and the November contract at 266 yuan, continuing the bullish trend.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Continues to Soar; Seems to Have No End in Sight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw extremely favorable conditions due to the scarcity and high prices of yarn and thread, boosting confidence in the cloth industry. However, the rapid increase in cloth prices in recent days has not been matched by a similar increase in sales in various regions, causing agents in Shanghai to hesitate in making purchases due to price limits. However, any hesitation leads to further price increases, causing significant delays. Consequently, most agents from the Yangtze River and Fujian regions are urging customers to come to Shanghai in person to purchase goods. Customers from various regions are flocking to Shanghai, causing a surge in demand. Even distant customers, unable to secure goods through agents, are instructing them to search and purchase at market prices. As a result, market prices are repeatedly soaring, with no end in sight. The heaviest gains are seen in heavy-weight coarse cloth from factories, with small quantities of spot goods rising by another 1.2 jiao (per piece) yesterday. Light-weight coarse cloth also rose by 1 jiao, and fine twill rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Fine cloth of various brands is out of stock. Yesterday, a small amount was released, with prices jumping by over 2 jiao (per piece) compared to the previous week. Spot goods such as line ne direct words, serge, yuan yu silk, blue cloth, white flannel, and printed flannel also rose by around 1.5 jiao (per piece). Eastern goods such as fine cloth, fine twill, and gray cloth all saw consistent gains of 5 fen to 1 jiao (per piece). 84 gray cloth rose by as much as 1.5 jiao, and Four Gentlemen serge rose by 1.5 jiao (per piece). Stocks of coarse cloth from various Shanghai factory distributors are sold out. Japanese trading houses are also actively selling futures, offering over a thousand pieces of goods such as white cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, gray cloth, undyed satin, and serge, mostly for delivery in November and December.</p>
<h3>Grains: Non-industry Players Aggressively Buy Wheat; January Contracts Rise by 1.3 Jiao; Others Also Rise by 7-8 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw prices initially decline after opening in the morning, followed by a sharp rebound. Imported wheat prices fell by 1 to 4 jiao, causing near-month prices to drop by 2 to 3 fen compared to the previous day. However, contracts from December onwards saw a surge in demand from the yarn and cotton industry and the financial industry, causing anxiety in the market. Prices for all months rose by 6 to 7 fen. It was reported that multiple parties bought as many as 80 to 90 truckloads in several morning sessions. In the afternoon session, near-month contracts remained stable, but contracts from December onwards continued to see bullish activity, pushing prices to unprecedented highs. The January contract rose to 6.1 yuan, an increase of 1.3 jiao compared to the previous day, while others rose by 7 to 8 fen. Given the continued speculation, the future of the people's food supply is highly concerning if the authorities do not impose restrictions. In the spot wheat market, the highest quality goods also rose by 5 to 6 fen, with Shandong wheat reaching 5.8 yuan. Prices for other goods remained similar to yesterday. Factories made only slight concessions due to high prices, resulting in a total of only 2,000 bales traded in the market.</p>
<h3>Large Volumes Surface; Flour Market Turns Soft; Fundamental Solution Lies in Raw Material Issue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw prices initially level off after opening in the morning, followed by a brief uptick, and then a return to softness. Imported wheat prices saw a slight rebound in Chicago by 1 jiao and a slight rebound in Canada by about 4 jiao, bringing some calm to the market at the opening. Opening prices fell by around 1.5 fen compared to the previous day's closing prices. However, starting from the second session, the market saw another boost due to continued demand from non-industry players. Bids for all months gradually increased, recovering 1 to 2 fen compared to the opening session. In the afternoon session, the bullish trend in the wheat market reignited concerns, causing the market to improve by about 1 fen compared to the morning. However, large-scale bulls sold off, and some floating bulls followed suit, softening the market. Prices fell by 1 to 2 fen compared to the opening. Industry insiders speculate that market stability requires both securing the supply of raw materials and strictly prohibiting exports to gradually calm the market.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Autumn Harvest of Orchid Seeds Enters the Market</h3>
<p>New orchid seeds of the Autumn Harvest variety have recently entered the market. With the refreshing air of Chrysanthemum Day, the goods are extremely yellow, bright, and fragrant. A small quantity arrived in Shanghai yesterday and was immediately offered at a price of 3 to 4 yuan higher than ordinary goods. However, mid- and lower-grade goods remained flat.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<h3>Gold Market Opens for December: Speculation Rises in Reaction; Market Flat Early, Then Surges to Cover Shorts</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a rise in pure gold prices, leading to a slightly stable opening. The morning market was relatively flat, but the afternoon saw a surge as short-sellers moved to cover their positions, triggering a reactive rise in prices. Buying interest followed. Early morning checks on overseas silver markets showed flat prices in both England and the United States. The Montevideo forward silver price remained unchanged or declined by up to 2%. Exchange rates were slightly higher. London spot gold rose by one penny. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates showed no change for England and the United States.

While Fuxing Yong was selling, Yuan Mao and Yong were buying. The morning opened strong and remained stable. Large short-sellers continued to increase their positions, soon leading to a downturn. Big players took advantage of the low prices to buy, making it easier to drive prices up. The HSBC announced exchange rate showed a rise of .0625 for the pound, while the U.S. dollar was flat. There were many sellers. Afterward, there was a slight pullback. The announced silver equalization tax was unchanged, having little impact. Soon, buyers were active again. The trend stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, big players, after remaining quiet, started actively buying. Large short-sellers seized the opportunity to cover, leading to a sudden surge in buying interest. As the rally began, remaining shorts rushed to cover, causing a gradual rebound in prices. The day ended strong. A record of the day's market conditions follows:</p>

Commercial banks squeezed the pound and bought the U.S. dollar. HSBC announced that the pound rose by .0625, while the U.S. dollar was flat and fluctuated. Later, although Mobil Oil bought near- and far-term U.S. dollars, banks sold quite a bit. The announced silver equalization tax was unchanged, and the process was dull. At noon, the market fluctuated due to banks both squeezing and selling. In the afternoon, the Japanese central bank squeezed to close out forward Donghui, while foreign banks squeezed near-term U.S. dollars. The overall trend fluctuated. By the close, the near-term selling prices were 1 shilling 2 pence .4375 and a halfpenny matching offer for the pound, and 29.5 yuan for the U.S. dollar.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Decline Throughout the Day; Total Decline Ranges From Small .4 to .75 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese merchant securities market, while lacking major waves, trended lower throughout the day. Although trading was not heavy, buyers were few and far between. The market, after a period of consolidation, transformed into a state of lethargy. Although rumors circulated, they were not worth listening to. In general, there was excessive crowding on the long side. Short sellers, knowing the difficulty, retreated and gradually decreased their positions. As a result, market prices failed to rally. The overall trend lacked positive signs. Underlying risks remained unresolved. The outlook did not suggest a sharp decline. Yesterday's trading was weak throughout the day. The amount of decline per trade was roughly equal, mostly ranging from a small .05 to .2 yuan. Although the decline was not drastic, the trend remained weak. Number 35 bonds were consistently offered for sale. Others, such as numbers 5, 32, 43, 47, and 53, also gradually emerged for sale. Buyers were scarce, indicating the potential for a storm on the horizon. It is undeniable that the situation is brewing for a change. The outlook remains quite risky. As a result, market prices uniformly declined by .4 to .75 yuan. The total transaction volume was 6,681,000 yuan. A comparative table of the resulting price changes is provided below (unit: yuan; one unit represents 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Daily US Silk Prices Decline Slightly; Local Silk Market Feels Even More Desolate</h3>
<p>Recently, overseas silk markets have been rising daily. Up until the previous two days, they felt even more firm. As a result, silk trading in Shanghai gradually turned more robust. Sales in America and France also showed eagerness. Looking at the silk industry's prosperity, it seemed as if it could be expected shortly. However, yesterday, daily US prices declined significantly (Quan Bin spot prices fell 1-2 yuan, futures fell 6 yuan, New York December prices fell 3 cents, and far-month May prices fell 2 cents). Shanghai's export silk will inevitably be hindered. Silk telegrams sent the previous day received little response yesterday morning, so trading also declined. Sales to user businesses still have not become smooth. Local trading became even more desolate. Yesterday, a total of 135 bales of domestic and foreign silk were sold. On average, transaction prices were about 20 yuan higher than last week.</p>
<h3>A Slight Turnaround for Fine Mei Green Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw a slight turnaround for the Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang varieties of Fine Mei green tea. British merchants such as Xie He, Bao Long, Du De, and Tong Fu began purchasing. The total city trading volume was over 300 boxes. Lu Zhuang core-extracted goods were priced at 84 yuan. Tunxi Fine Mei was priced at 56 yuan. Tu Zhuang was priced at 35 yuan. The average cargo price was 3-4 yuan lower than the previous market. There were also scattered sales of Needle Mei and Xiu Mei varieties.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Slight Decline in Re-exported East White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trended flat. The association's standard price for #24 coarse granulated white sugar was 21.8 yuan; re-exported sugar was 6.33 yuan. East White spot prices did not change much. #4 was 21.7 yuan, #8 was 21.4 yuan, and Maru was 21.2 yuan. Re-exported sugar fell by a small .05 yuan. #4 was 6.45 yuan, and #5 was 6.25 yuan. The Zhen Ji Brand #1 cotton white sugar from the local factory was 20.5 yuan. Prices for numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were refunded. Scattered trading occurred at these prices, and there were no price changes.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third tender period for the jointly formed company this week. The fixed quota for Guangdong sugar was 8,108 bags. The tender prices were as before. The company sold 1,030 bags of Wuyang coarse white sugar from the Shunde factory at 21.5 yuan; and another 100 bags from the Qu Xi factory at 20.9 yuan, and 50 bags of medium granulated white sugar at 19.4 yuan. The rest were unsold.</p>
<h3>Rice Market: Kiln Rice Sales to the North Remain Smooth</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, a total of over 40 sources arrived, carrying a total of over 8,000 shi of goods. Urban and rural shops continued to show weakness, causing the price of new japonica rice to fall by .05 to .1 yuan. Fortunately, kiln rice and Bai Ge, Qing Yan, and Wei Lian brands continued to purchase 1,400-1,500 bags, plus over 100 bags of thin broken rice, allowing the market to be maintained in a stable state. New Yang Jian followed the decline in japonica rice, falling by nearly a chi. Lu Jian, due to larger sources, was depreciated by a jiao or more. Thick and thin broken japonica rice were slightly softer. New Yin Yuan goods lacked aroma and remained firmly expensive.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from the river. The market somewhat favored inexpensive goods. However, new and old kiln rice and Bian Yuan rice were still good. Market prices for new japonica rice were down slightly by a jiao or so. Broken japonica rice was weaker by more than a jiao. New and old Bian Yuan prices increased by more than .2 yuan. Kiln rice was scarce and prices were firm. Yang Du Bu showed some weakness, and guest rice was standing tall. [Prices from] the Hsia Shih rice market on the 16th [are listed below]:</p>

<h3>Revised Implementation Outline for Middle School Physical Education in Jiangsu Province (II) Announced by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for the 25th Year</h3>
<p>Morning Exercises and Compulsory Running</p>
<p>(1) The time for morning exercises in each school shall, in principle, begin at 6:30 AM. During the cold winter months (standardized as indoor temperature falls to 35 degrees Celsius or below), the Physical Education Committee may decide to change to inter-class exercises. (2) The morning exercise curriculum will be reviewed, approved, and published by the Department. All schools must uniformly adopt it. However, physical education instructors may determine the number of movements in each section. This curriculum, consisting of 20 sequences, should be changed every two weeks and printed and distributed to all students in advance so that they understand the name and method of each movement, for the purpose of self-study and teaching others in the future. (3) Class instructors shall be responsible for supervising and managing morning exercises, and verifying the number of absentees, which shall be announced once a week. (4) If compulsory running is held continuously after morning exercises, the amount of morning exercise curriculum should be appropriately reduced to prevent students from becoming too tired. (5) Students should pay the same attention to agility when attending morning exercises as they do during emergency assemblies. Those who have not joined the ranks after the exercises have already begun shall be considered absent. (6) Students attending morning exercises shall uniformly wear the prescribed uniform or sportswear. Violators will be considered absent without cause.</p>
<p>Extracurricular Activities</p>
<p>(1) From this year forward, each school should immediately pilot mandatory extracurricular sports, so that each student has at least 40 minutes of outdoor activities each day. (2) To implement mandatory extracurricular sports, each school's curriculum should be designed to ensure that there are no classes scheduled after 4:00 PM each day. (3) Schools implementing mandatory extracurricular sports may choose one of the following four methods for implementation: 1. If there are no classes after 4:00 PM and the school has sufficient facilities, all students may go to the playground for sports simultaneously. Students should choose one item beforehand, and the Physical Education Committee will assign them appropriately and conduct each sport on time. 2. If there are no classes after 4:00 PM, but the facilities are insufficient to accommodate all students simultaneously, all students should be divided into two or three groups, and each group should take turns going to the playground. While one group is exercising, the other groups should be assigned other extracurricular assignments by the school, such as self-study, music, gardening, or labor, to avoid wasting time. 3. If the school has sufficient facilities but must schedule other classes after 4:00 PM, classes that have no classes at that time should form a group and implement the methods described in item (1).

<h3>Hong Kong Plane Donation Soccer Match: China United Ties World Games Team, Each Scoring One Goal with No Winner</h3>
<p>Hong Kong News: The Hong Kong Chinese Physical Culture Advancement Association, led by the South China, China, Kowloon, and Oriental Associations, held a soccer match yesterday (11th) to celebrate President Chiang Kai-shek's birthday and raise funds for a plane donation. Li Huitang and Bao Jiaping, members of China's soccer team attending the World Games, and others appeared in uniform. They faced a team composed of members from the four Chinese associations. Hong Kong fans, seeing the match as a chance to raise funds for a plane donation and serve the country and the nation, were especially eager to attend. By noon, spectators were already arriving one after another. The hills near Caroline Hill were also packed with people. The total proceeds for the day amounted to approximately 1,500 yuan. The match ended in a 1-1 tie. The match was very grand. In addition to Dr. Law Yuk-ho, a representative of the Chinese community, hosting the kickoff ceremony, the Chung Sing Charitable Society music team was invited to the stadium to add to the atmosphere. Among the dignitaries present were Yan Chengkun, Chairman of the Association; Huang Maolin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce; Guo Xianhong, Chairman of the Chinese Association; Liu Jingqing, Chairman of the Dongguan Merchants Association; Chen Lanfang; and Chen Qiyou, Representative of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stationed in Hong Kong, totaling over a thousand people. It was an unprecedented event since the beginning of this year's soccer season.</p>
<p>Law Yuk-ho Kicks Off</p>
<p>At 4:30, the World Games team and the China United team entered the stadium one after another. Only Li Tiansheng of the Guangdong four knights on the World Games team came to Hong Kong to help out. The others were unable to attend due to other engagements. Due to the lack of players, Li Zhaorong and Li Shuyou were added to the team. The China United team also replaced Yang Guohua with a new member. After the two teams entered the field, they circled the field in a procession led by the Chung Sing music team and played the national anthem. The entire audience stood at attention. After that, the athletes from the two teams lined up in two rows in the middle of the field. Dr. Law Yuk-ho shook hands with each of them to express his appreciation. The athletes then separated into two formations, and Dr. Law stepped out into the field to briefly kick the soccer ball. The two teams then began the match.</p>
<p>World Games Scores First Goal</p>
<p>The match began at 5:00 PM, with Law Yuk-ho officiating the kickoff ceremony. The World Games team immediately launched an attack. The forwards pierced through the left and right sides, and the China United team found it difficult to cope. The World Games team attacked for about five minutes. Cao Duwei had a good opportunity to cross the ball, and Li Zhaorong turned and charged into the penalty area, but was unsuccessful. Huang Meishun rushed forward to meet the ball and shot from outside the 20-yard area, scoring a goal. The World Games team opened the scoring. After the restart, China United attacked fiercely in response to the unfortunate first goal. Li Tiansheng had the air of a hero holding the pass, and it's hard for ten thousands of men to beat him. Rong Zhao seized the ball and passed it to the forward. Cao Guicheng led the way, going straight in, passing the ball with beauty, but no one met it in the middle. Hua Ji was able to calmly save the ball. Before long, Guicheng came back, Shi Jin passed the ball to the left, and Shuyou crossed the ball again, revealing the old general Xian Zan's prowess. He and De Pu fought against the strong force, and the World Games team were unsuccessful again. De Hui led the counterattack, Guangsen instigated on the edge, and Zhang Manrong responded on the left. The World Games team's goal was in a state of high alert. Bao Jiaping struggled to cope. De Hui got a chance to shoot, but Tiansheng rescued in time. Zhang Manrong rushed from the left and kicked at the goal, but it missed by a hair's breadth. The crisis was not over, and another dangerous situation came. China United invaded in five directions, besieging the enemy's goal. Bao abandoned the door to rescue, and an empty city was enacted. Without preventing the China United forward unexpectedly firing a cold arrow, Tiansheng laid in ambush in front of the goal, heading the ball out. Ben Han took advantage of the situation to knock the door, but unfortunately it was unsuccessful. After the World Games team suffered this blow, they hurriedly sought to stabilize their position and drive the counterattack. Hui Tang supplied the two wings, but the opponent's defense was tight. Zhaorong was slow and missed the opportunity, and Shuyou's good passes were in vain. Bao Jiaping became the target of everyone's attacks, repeatedly turning the tide. Huang Meishun's two long-range shots were blocked. Liang Rongzhao resisted the enemy's front line. In the first half, the World Games team took the lead 1-0.</p>
<p>China United Ties</p>
<p>Changing sides again, the World Games team gradually showed signs of fatigue. Li Huitang led the forwards to attack, Zhaorong and Shi Jin advanced with short passes, Cao Guicheng and Shuyou's crosses were well-timed, but no one met them in the middle. A great opportunity was lost. Before long, Huang Meishun advanced, but was unsuccessful. Liang Rongzhao, Li Guowei, and Mai Shaohan worked together to encircle the rear, and then launched a counterattack. Cao Guicheng showed his great power, breaking through and cutting generals, showing his old skills. When he saw that he was approaching, he passed the ball to the middle. Li Zhaorong was rushing over from a horse, and was only three yards away from the goal, he made a pointless shot. A victory chance was lost, and the whole audience sighed. After being besieged for a moment, China United launched a counterattack. Zhang Manrong passed diagonally, and Ben Han knocked the ball in, but the referee saw it clearly and ruled it offside. The fans were happy for nothing. A little while after, Manrong suddenly ambushed, forced himself to shoot, and Bao Jiaping held A Dou in his arms, saving in a beautiful posture. Guangsen charged back again, and after crossing, Song Lingsheng topped the ball with his head. Chen Dehui charged in on a single horse, Tiansheng shielded him with an iron bell, and Ben Han took the opportunity to charge over. Bao Jiaping abandoned the goal and snatched the ball from Ben Han's feet, turning the tide at the brink of collapse. At that time, Li Tiansheng bravely fought to the point where he was injured in the foot and left the field. The World Games team fought with a smaller number and in front of the goal. Bao Jiaping used his fists to save the danger several times. Meishun touched the ball with his hand in the chaotic army and was penalized a twelve-yard shot. Ben Han kicked the ball in, and the result was a 1-1 tie. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>World Games Team</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Li Shuyou, Zhuo Shijin, Li Huitang, Li Zhaorong, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>China United Team</p>
<p>Huang Huaji, Huang Xibing, Liang Xianzhan, Yang Guohua, Lin Depu, He Zuoxian, Zhang Manrong, Yang Benhan, Chen Dehui, Song Lingsheng, Deng Guangsen</p>

<h3>YMCA Plans Air Raid and Anti-Poisoning Testing and Promotes Sports Equipment; Plans to Establish a Happy Home for Poor Children</h3>
<p>The recent work plan of the YMCA in this city includes planning air raid and anti-poisoning first aid knowledge testing, expanding sports equipment, and establishing a Happy Home for Poor Children, etc. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Air Raid Knowledge Testing In view of the extraordinary period and the extremely important task of imparting air raid, anti-poisoning, and first aid knowledge to the public, the Association held an air raid, anti-poisoning, and first aid exhibition this summer, which was very effective. The Association is now planning to hold this regular test to deeply imprint all the key points in the public's mind and is actively preparing.</p>
<p>Expanding Sports Equipment The gymnasium of the Association's new hall has not been completed due to the impact of the January 28th Incident. Efforts are being made to raise construction funds of approximately 200,000 yuan. In addition, the Association's gym is too small to accommodate a large number of people to exercise, so it is planned to open a square in the city center as a public sports field, which is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>Establish a Happy Home for Poor Children The Association believes that there are many poor children in this city who are wandering the streets, and society has paid little attention to them. Therefore, in the past two years, the Association held a Happy Gathering for Poor Children on Christmas, which was quite successful. However, it is only held once a year, and the poor children have limited gains. Therefore, it is planned to select an area with the most poor children to hold a Happy Home, to prepare for long-term work and raise approximately 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Girls' High School Raises Funds to Purchase Aircraft; Faculty and Staff Hold Musical Performance</h3>
<p>The faculty and staff of Sino-Western Girls' High School, in view of the urgent national crisis and the importance of national defense, decided to hold a musical performance at the school's new auditorium at 8:30 PM on the 29th of this month to raise funds to purchase aircraft to present to the government to help consolidate national defense. The musical work to be performed, the Gip'y Suite, is a set of connected songs depicting the wandering life of Gypsies, divided into three acts, with both singing and dancing. The program is very exciting. Tickets are priced at one yuan and two yuan, both with assigned seating, and donations will not be solicited inside the venue. Reservations can be made at the school from now on or by calling 20800. People from all walks of life are encouraged to purchase tickets and participate in this grand event.</p>

<h3>Revolution of Peace</h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>Our country's autocratic politics, with a history spanning over two thousand years, was finally overthrown twenty-five years ago. However, when will the oppression of women, which has an equally long history as autocratic politics, come to an end?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chinese women today seem to be quite different from those in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. For example, they have already won inheritance rights, equal rights in education, the right to vote and be elected, and women's marital rights have also gained autonomy. Women can also serve in various professional fields. Naturally, it cannot be denied that women have broken free from their shackles, and like the martyrs who overthrew the Qing Dynasty twenty-five years ago, they have raised their heads. However, I believe that this is only liberation in name. In reality, women still need a major revolution of liberation to strive for true freedom and equal status.</p>
<p>"Refuse to be slaves" is the slogan of the women's liberation movement. Now, women who have been liberated in form must enrich their spirit of not being slaves. The prerequisites for not being slaves should be mentioned here first: (1) Read more books to broaden your knowledge. (2) Acquire a professional skill to be self-reliant. (3) Reduce external temptations by refraining from applying makeup and powder. (4) Avoid petty gains to avoid base inducements.</p>
<p>The above four points cut off the fuse that leads men to treat women as objects of entertainment. At the same time, for women who are hostile to men who plunder women's bodies and spirits, a strong fortress should be built, which can be used for both offense and defense, to protect themselves. This strong fortress should be built by women themselves—a large-scale women's organization centered on occupation and economy, with all other issues related to women as attachments. Now, let us briefly list some of the work that should be done. (1) Promote legitimate women's occupations. (2) Introduce occupations. (3) Open up new paths for women in the professional field. (4) Promote, encourage, or force savings. (5) Relieve unemployed women. (6) Seek legal protection for women. (7) Provide counseling on marriage issues. (8) Improve the lives of working women. (9) Protect the health of working women. (10) Encourage working women to serve society in their spare time. (11) Monitor the weak-willed behavior of working women and provide appropriate guidance.</p>
<p>If the women's circles in our country truly have such a sound organization, then the status of working women in our country will surely be greatly improved as a result. At present, the occurrence of general scandals is roughly based on the following points. (1) Being lured due to fear of unemployment or economic difficulties. (2) Being seduced due to youth, weak will, and lack of experience. (3) Developing multiple relationships due to a lack of understanding of men or unfamiliarity with love experiences. (4) Going astray due to a lack of proper entertainment or ways to pass the time in spare time. Under the protection of a sound women's organization, and with the self-reflection of the four prerequisites for not being slaves, even if men everywhere set traps for women, engaging in the work of playing with women or taking women as prisoners, women can move forward safely and confidently everywhere, striving for true freedom and equality in the future.</p>
<p>This is a method of revolution without bloodshed, just like the Xinhai Revolution without bloodshed. However, what is indispensable for this kind of peaceful revolution is: (1) A strong will. (2) A calm attitude. (3) A tight organization. (4) A strong and continuous perseverance. (5) Honest means. (6) A spirit of unity. The success of the Xinhai Revolution had these qualities. Women must also work hard in this way to move from formal liberation to complete liberation.</p>
<h3>The Courageous Spirit of Spanish Women Serving on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>In the civil war in Spain, the most noteworthy thing for us is the spirit of service of women on the battlefield. We have read about the amazing deeds of female soldiers in various European countries in ancient times in several novels, and such events are now being realized again in this country of Spain. In Spain, this time, the women who joined the People's Front to resist the fascist rebels have achieved amazing results on the battlefield. They are fully armed, holding rifles and box cannons, trekking long distances, passing through many rugged mountain roads, arriving in Madrid, and taking on the defense work of the capital, resisting the rebel offensive, as fierce as tigresses. In all cities loyal to the government, there are female soldiers patrolling the streets everywhere, maintaining local order and rescuing wounded soldiers on the front lines. The intensity of their work is unprecedented. The bravery of Spanish women in this way reminds us of the great deeds of female heroes in ancient books.</p>
<p>Among the participating women in Spain, one of the most noteworthy is La Pasionaria. She has always participated in the work of the military in Madrid. In the eyes of Spanish workers, she is like a worker's Christ, and she has been engaged in political work as early as ten years ago. Since the outbreak of the war, she has led a large number of working women to the front lines, personally firing guns. The soldiers she leads account for at least one-tenth of the government's total military force. Her real name is Dolores Ibárruri. She has long been involved in revolutionary work as a representative of the Communist Party. Among the people, she is even more famous for her beautiful appearance, eloquent speeches, and passion. Someone gave her the elegant nickname "Flower of Passion."</p>
<p>She is forty-one years old this year and looks like a French female revolutionary. Her face is very haggard. Even mixed in with her enemies, one can tell that she is a beautiful Spanish woman. Initially, she intended to study education and prepare to become a female teacher in the future, but at that time, in addition to her studies, she devoted part of her time to studying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and others. Later, she became very poor and worked as a seamstress in a small town in a coal mining area. As a result, she participated in various activities in this mining area. During the dictatorship of Prime Minister Rivera in Spain, she and her husband were arrested and imprisoned. In February 1934, during a socialist revolution, their residence in Austurias was completely destroyed, and as a result, they went to live in the Soviet Union for a short time. Last winter, at the Seventh Congress of the Third International, she was elected as a member of the Executive Committee, so she is even more famous in the world. Her bravery is known to everyone. During the revolution in Spain last February, she escaped from prison once. At that time, the defense regiment and the guards still obeyed the former government. Family members or relatives were not allowed to visit prisoners outside the iron fence. In order to get someone to open the iron gate of the prison, the guards raised their guns to intimidate the prisoners, saying that anyone who wanted to go out would be killed. Unable to obtain the cooperation of the local officials, La Pasionaria suddenly climbed onto the iron fence, preventing the guards from firing, while calling on all the prisoners in the prison to escape. Observers on the French border, including Spanish refugees, all know that she is not very deeply convinced of communism. She only knows how to serve the government army and attack the fascist rebels. If the Spanish civil war results in the final victory of the government army, then the new cabinet will probably not be without this female hero.</p>
<h3>The Military and Women</h3>
<p>— Yifa</p>
<p>Heroes and beauties have created many touching stories since ancient times, almost as if the two are inseparable spouses. It seems that women should not exist in the military, but in fact, the military needs women very much. In ancient China, it was believed that women's participation in war was unlucky, and it was considered to carry the colors of witchcraft and trickery. However, there were more famous female generals in ancient times than in Europe and the United States. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, female comrades mostly took on political work, and few actually participated in combat with guns. After the implementation of Russia's industrial policy, it proved that women's labor strength is not inferior to that of men. The results of the Spanish civil unrest can also prove that women's combat power in participating in war is not weaker than that of men. Because this time, many women without any training can also rush to the front lines and learn how to fight. Therefore, many military experts feel that it is necessary for women in the country to receive the same military training.</p>
<p>There are also women behind the Abyssinian army. As long as they hear the sound of guns and artillery, and witness the tragic state of exploding bombs, they ignore their children and their husband's property, and flee randomly into the mountains. This is truly a world of difference from Spanish women. This is the result of different levels of education and daily training. Chinese women have not received much training, and they do not have the strong physique of women in Abyssinia. If we close our eyes and imagine, if war breaks out, Chinese women will not only be unable to handle things in the rear, but will also have to rely on men to protect them and take refuge. They will never be able to automatically escape like women in Abyssinia. It often happens that one woman detects a secret or leaks military information, causing thousands upon thousands of troops to fall into a trap, and hundreds of square miles of territory are lost as a result. Therefore, women often play an active role in the military, acting as important spies. Even if they do not formally enter the military and retreat to the rear, they can also assist the front-line troops. Nursing the wounded and maintaining industry and commerce have become the responsibilities of women in the rear. During the European War, literate women often wrote letters home for the elderly women and young children to the front-line soldiers, reporting on the situation at home so that they could fight with peace of mind. There are countless photos of women on soldiers' bodies. In the most brutal war, humanity still cannot forget the love of children. Therefore, women can make men bravely kill the enemy and become martyrs, and they can also make men become slaves and traitors.</p>
<p>Japanese women will never dislike their army, although they also know that war is inhumane. However, in order to fulfill their responsibilities as women, they often do work such as comforting the army to encourage the soldiers on the front lines, and at the same time, they strive to learn all preparations in the rear. Loads of tobacco comfort bags, etc., are shipped to Manchuria and North China like military supplies. Under this kind of national crisis, it is not enough for women in our country to simply apply less rouge and buy more domestic goods. We should go a step further and make active training and preparations.</p>
<h3>Women and Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Baixia</p>
<p>We are disgusted by women who specialize in making a fuss about clothing; however, we are not asking women to be unkempt. No, we do not object to women studying how clothing should be tailored to fit and be hygienic; because with research, clothing can then progress. People are always on the path of progress, as long as they do not waste time and energy, as long as they can make good use of time and energy, there is nothing that cannot be done, and there is nothing that has already been done that does not help progress.</p>
<p>It is the same with makeup. As the saying goes, "Three parts talent, seven parts dress." If people do not pay attention to the beauty and neatness of their appearance, not only will people be disgusted with you, but you yourself will not benefit in any way psychologically. For example, do we need to remove the dirt that accumulates on our skin? Of course, this is necessary! Therefore, when we remove this dirt, not only will our faces be beautiful, but we will also leave an outlet for the sweat excreted from the body. Soap is used to remove dirt, and most of the other perfumes, cold creams, tooth powders, and toothpastes are also necessities for everyone. However, the words should also be turned around: if they are used improperly, that is to say, if they are too wasteful, this is also wrong; and we should also use domestic products, and domestic products are not lacking in good perfumes, cold creams, tooth powders, and toothpastes. However, nowadays, fashionable women think that foreign goods are good and domestic goods are not good, so they use foreign goods for this and foreign goods for that. This is not empty talk, this is based on evidence. Just look at the newspapers in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, there is such a big headline:</p>
<p>"Imports of Lipsticks, Perfumes, and Cosmetics Increase Without Decrease 1.</p>
<p>1 Lipsticks and Perfumes... Amazing Imports!"</p>
<p>The content of this news tells us that: "According to the investigation report of the Statistics Department of the International Trade Bureau, the total value of imported lipsticks and perfumes in the country for eight months this year is 442,403 yuan in national currency, the value of imported tooth powders and toothpastes is 264,627 yuan, and the value of imported snow powders and creams is 183,608 yuan. The total number of imported cosmetics in these three items reaches more than 900,000 yuan in national currency, which is more than 30,000 yuan higher than the same period last year in the item of lipsticks and perfumes."</p>
<p>Okay, after copying the news, I don't want to say more, I just ask the wise women to think about it, is it worth it for us to spend more than 900,000 yuan of silver on cosmetics?</p>
<h3>Women of Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>— Sheli</p>
<p>In some cities and villages, such songs are popular: The sun rises on the mountain, a little yellow, raising a daughter to choose a husband; only care about a lot of money, not caring about the white-haired old groom! Because of the closed atmosphere, new ideas have been defeated in southern Anhui, and the old marriage system is still prevalent in southern Anhui. Free love is seen as bizarre and corrupting morals, and "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers" are still the masters of the "lifelong affairs" of girls. Parents always like to marry their daughters to "fill the room" [become a widow's second wife]. The old man knows the difficulties, especially knows how to please the father-in-law and mother-in-law, not like young people floating around, love romance, can not stand the foothold, can not protect the family property, this is the reason why parents want to marry their daughters to "fill the room".</p>
<p>Of course, there are other reasons: the daughter is too young, usually pampered, does not understand things, in order to avoid suffering from the in-laws, it is better to marry an old man, without in-laws, an old and a young couple live a comfortable life, parents also feel sorry for their daughters.</p>
<p>Although the age of the son-in-law is suitable for being the daughter's uncle, is the daughter willing or not? This is the daughter's business, and has nothing to do with the father-in-law and mother-in-law.</p>
<p>These women who "fill the room" are mostly in charge as soon as they pass the door. In addition to serving the old husband and driving the slaves (you know! It is still common in middle-class families in southern Anhui), the rest of the homework is to embroider flowers and make double shoes to send into love: there are lined ones that often add eight circles, or call the neighbors to dig flowers.</p>
<p>Life is leisurely, but sometimes seeing the husband with white hair, the eyebrows can not help but pick up melancholy, even if the desire for sex makes people distressed, but if the husband dies unfortunately, there is only one way to keep the festival! Because chastity is still the precious treasure of women in southern Anhui!</p>
<h3>Confessions of a Female Police Trainee</h3>
<p>— Shiqiong</p>
<p>Since I learned the stories in the book, I have envied "Mulan joining the army." However, China only has men's armies, not women's armies. Military academies everywhere only accept men, not women. I wanted to join the army, but I had no way to enter; plus the opposition of my family, which made me even less likely to achieve my ambition alone.</p>
<p>After graduating from middle school, life forced me to take the path of an elementary school teacher. More than two years of white chalk, red ink, made my eyes tired, and tore my throat; a heart that has always been regarded as a female husband has been suppressed beyond appeal. I finally abandoned the teaching whip, without asking my parents, without consulting my sisters, and entered the door of recruiting female police trainees.</p>
<p>"Police", although not "military", is also a member of "holding a weapon to defend the country" in extraordinary times. I thought it would not go against my original wish.</p>
<p>Now, I am a "police trainee"; I have taken off my cumbersome cheongsam, put on light armed clothes; I have taken off my shiny silk stockings and put on tight bandages; I have cut short my oily black hair and put on a flat-topped military hat; I have abandoned the needle and thread and picked up the gun; majestic and energetic, who can tell that we are women? Sometimes curious men and women gather to our training ground to watch, "Ah! Who says they are female police trainees? Aren't they the same as men?" These surprised discussions often blow past our ears.</p>
<p>Before dawn, we hear a bugle, and we get up to drill. In the daytime, half the time is in the lecture hall, and half the time is on the training ground. Our life is completely militarized; our diet and living are regular, hard, and there is no pretense. The undulating waves of the Huangpu River symbolize our heartstrings; the sound of banging the gun handle at the Xipao Platform strengthens our courage. In the near future, we will be a part of the police who maintain law and order, and also a part of the soldiers who guard the territory! Some sisters simply look down on being a female police officer. As for me, I am determined to make my own economic independence as long as I can, not to be a parasite in society; is it more effective for the country and the nation than being drunk in the song and dance halls? How about a coquettish, soul-selling dancer? What about the concubine who is played by the rich and noble?</p>
<p>Ah! The strange whale in the East China Sea, raising its head and tumbling, wants to swallow the tame lambs on the mainland in one gulp: the beautiful grass is occupied by poisonous pythons running amok. Does this world still allow our women's circles to pose, flaunt their strangeness and compete for beauty, and enjoy the clear blessings in the boudoir?</p>
<p>I sincerely ask the awakened female compatriots! Wipe off the lipstick on your mouth, wash off the powder on your face, and show your strong, lively, innocent eyes.</p>
<p>Fashionable female compatriots! Take off your armbands, put down your gold diamonds, and change your strange costumes. Save your extravagant consumption and prepare one more bullet for the nation; free up your time for recreation and sew one more short shirt for us</p>
<p>If you don't want men to be subjects and women to be concubines, then from this moment on, 200 million female compatriots will set off together towards the road of national self-salvation.</p>
<h3>How to Deal with Infant Diseases</h3>
<p>— Ms. Peipei</p>
<p>Newborn babies are prone to illness due to their weak internal resistance. At that time, if the parents do not have any medical knowledge, they will be at a loss and deal with it randomly. Therefore, the methods of dealing with infant diseases are really common sense that parents must know.</p>
<p>1 Umbilical Cord Inflammation The umbilical cord will fall off after five to seven days of life, and it will heal itself soon, leaving an umbilical fossa. If, before the scar is formed, you accidentally tie an unclean cloth, or receive other dirty things, the navel will become red and swollen, and eventually it will fester and the body will become cooked. At this time, you should immediately soak a clean cloth in cold boric acid water and place it on top, make it lie flat quietly, and change the cloth once a day. After three or four days, it will be able to heal. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Income from Interviews with Professional Women (4) Thoughts and Life of Female Staff at New Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>— Xianying</p>
<p>(4) The question is: If a man's characteristics can be divided into the following seven items, what is the order in which you think your husband or lover should dare to have the characteristics in your mind? Now list their answers as follows:</p>
<p>(5) They have unknown aspirations for this motherland that is facing national crisis. The reporter first asked them how to save the country, and the result was no answer: then asked them if war broke out, what would you do? The answer is that four go to be nurses and one goes to be a spy, and then asks if your husband or lover wants to go to war, would you dissuade or encourage him? The answer is one dissuades and four encourage.</p>
<p>(6) Then the reporter explained that personal outlook on life is very important and asked (A) whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about their real lives? The answer is one optimistic and one pessimistic. (B) Do you agree or disagree with the idea of committing suicide to get rid of all the pain in life? The answer is four against and one no answer.</p>
<p>(7) Finally, I gave them a self-criticism and asked them to say their strengths and weaknesses. Now I will list them below:</p>
<p>Note: There are twelve strengths and twelve weaknesses. Each person chooses four strengths and four weaknesses that are most suitable for their personality.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the five ladies who were interviewed. Thank you for spending a few hours patiently answering my questions. I would like to express my infinite joy here. (End)</p>
<h3>The Subconscious (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Everything in the world is often very contradictory. A person with an extremely clear mind, far-reaching vision, and who has received higher education, will sometimes do things that are very troublesome; even in the process of doing them, they are very aware, knowing that this thing should not be done, that it is harmful and useless to both others and themselves, but in the end, they still do it, and can only accept people's curses without argument: "A victim of their subconscious"!</p>
<p>Humans have an upward drive; consciousness sinking downward is simply like reversing a car, something that seems unlikely to happen. But in reality, it is a common occurrence, and recently, it has befallen Liu Yifan, a young sculptor who is usually known for his fortitude.</p>
<p>Yifan is a young man who lives for art. After studying Western painting in China for several years, he went to Italy and spent a full four years there, concentrating on studying the art of sculpture. He simply ignored everything outside of sculpture to an extreme degree. For example, when it came to clothing, he never added a new item in his four years in Italy. Even if his shirt was so torn that it had openwork stripes, he would still wear it. As for eating, it was not uncommon for him to skip a day, or to eat five or six times a day. These things were not uncommon, because there are many artists who deliberately put on such performances, and they all have a main idea, which is "art does not forget love, love does not forget art"; therefore, artists are often busier than ordinary people when it comes to interacting with the opposite sex. However, Liu Yifan was not like this. Someone once asked him which province that strangely beautiful Chinese female student who lived with him was from, and he couldn't answer, because his entire mind was occupied by "curves," "plaster," "models," etc., and there was no room left for anything else.</p>
<p>After returning to China, many people who were doing the same or similar work as him inevitably had to take on some classes in schools to first establish a position, or to hold a personal exhibition to create some empty fame; but Yifan was unwilling to do so. He felt that it would not be easy to make any further progress in his art by doing so, and at the same time, thanks to his father's connections, he was allowed to independently organize a small-scale sculpture engineering company, where he continued his research while also taking on some bronze statue or relief-type projects.</p>
<p>In the third year after his return to China, many relatives and friends were discussing why everyone had never seen Liu Yifan. They thought that the sculpture company's business was probably too good, so he was too busy to be seen. But those who often interacted with his father would deny this for him, saying that his life was very difficult and that he relied entirely on his father's support, so at the age of twenty-nine, he had never even thought about women.</p>

<p>Has the Gonorrhea Healed?</p>
<p>No. 50, Mr. Li Liaojing, 117 Penglai Road, asks: I am eighteen years old. Due to a lack of willpower, I was seduced by a neighbor, a loose woman, over a month ago, and lost my virginity to her. Unexpectedly, one or two days later, urination became painful, followed by the discharge of yellow pus. At the time, I was in great pain and full of regret. After a few days, I sought medical treatment. After four injections of serum (?) and several urethral irrigations, the pus gradually decreased after a few days, eventually disappearing. However, in addition to taking the medicine prescribed by the doctor, I also took two bottles of "Sandal Mindi." I would like to ask: (1) Why was urination extremely painful and impossible when I returned home after the first few urethral irrigations, and I could only urinate after sitting and resting for some time? (2) Currently, there is no sealant on the urethral opening in the morning, and urination is not painful, but I feel a dull pain inside the penis when it is erect, and the foreskin is slightly swollen on the left. (3) Sometimes the roots of the pubic hair are somewhat painful. (4) Sometimes I feel some pain in the perineum.</p>
<p>Answer: (1) This symptom is common when using strong medications for irrigation. At the same time, pay attention to whether there is "urethral stricture." (2) This is a sign that the illness has not completely healed. (3) This is a symptom of "gonorrhea," but pay attention to whether there is skin disease in this area. (4) There is suspicion of "prostatitis" and "seminal vesiculitis."</p>
<p>Is it Syphilis?</p>
<p>No. 51, Mr. ×××, No. 22 Fori, Lainer Road, French Concession, asks: Fourteen or fifteen years ago, I had intercourse without caution and had sperm leakage. Initially, I had no complaints. Last March, I felt a headache, and a powder-like substance appeared on my chest, causing itching. A traditional Chinese medicine doctor examined me and found a nodule on each wrist joint; he said it was syphilis, and one injection of 606 would cure it. However, the nodules on my wrist joints have not yet dissipated. The following year, another doctor gave me a white injection, but the nodules still did not dissipate. It has been more than ten years now, and I still have no complaints. In the spring of the year before last, I felt dizzy and weak, and the blood test showed no poison. The same was true last year. After the autumn of this year, I felt dizzy and weak again, and my appetite decreased. Because I am certain that I have not had intercourse with other women, I do not know what illness I have. I respectfully ask: (1) Is sperm leakage poisonous? (2) Is it syphilis? (3) Can the nodules on my wrists be dissipated now? (4) Should I use medication or injections? (5) Can syphilis recur after more than ten years? (6) What are the symptoms of secondary and tertiary syphilis?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) There is no such thing as sperm leakage being poisonous. (2) There is suspicion of "syphilis." Whether there are other illnesses cannot be determined. A negative blood test is not sufficient evidence that there is no poison. In a hundred "syphilis" patients, two or three people's blood cannot be tested. (3) If it is "syphilis," it can be dissipated. (4) It will be determined after diagnosis. (5) It can. (6) Roseola, papules, gummas, bone pain, and many other symptoms are not listed one by one. Moreover, the above symptoms are not necessarily present; some may have this but lack that, or have that but lack this. This is why "syphilis" is not easy to diagnose.</p>
<p>Regarding Blood Pressure</p>
<p>No. 52, Ms. Zhu Xue, No. 8 Jiujianfang, Rotten Man Hutong, Yiwai, Beijing, asks: My younger brother recently took an exam at a certain place. During the physical examination, he was told that his "blood pressure was too high." At the time, because there were many people being examined, it was inconvenient to ask the doctor about treatment methods. I am now taking the liberty of asking the following questions, and I would be grateful if you could answer them and provide guidance: (1) What are the dangers of high blood pressure? (2) What is the cause of this condition? (3) How should blood pressure be lowered? Is there a self-treatment method? (4) What foods should be avoided and what foods should be eaten on a regular basis? (My younger brother has no smoking or drinking habits.) (5) Will high blood pressure cause changes in various parts of the body? Are dizziness, sore throat, and cracked lips changes caused by high blood pressure? (6) My younger brother is still young. If he is not treated now, will his blood pressure continue to increase? Will it become a difficult-to-treat pain in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) There is no danger below 140 (normal people are around 120). Those with blood pressure above 140 can experience headaches, dizziness, abnormal sensation, paralysis, lateral blindness, and weak vision. Cerebral hemorrhage, etc., are quite dangerous. (2) There are spontaneous and secondary types. Spontaneous types are caused by excessive meat consumption, excessive use of the brain, and heredity; secondary types are caused by lead poisoning, colic, syphilis, spleen disease, arteriosclerosis, and atrophic kidney. In short, this is a symptom, not a disease. There are many causes, symptoms, and prognoses, and one cannot be treated in isolation. (3) First diagnose the cause and apply cause therapy. If the cause cannot be determined, take "Endojodin" or inject "Silimon." Eat less meat and salt, more vegetables and fruits, and take regular laxatives. (4) See (3). (5) See (1). Dizziness is caused by this, but sore throat and cracked lips have other causes and are not related to this disease. (6) The older the age, the higher the blood pressure. Although the underlying disease of this symptom will not become incurable in the future, the diseases caused by it will be quite difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Pulmonary Syphilis</p>
<p>No. 53, Mr. Zhou Shengxiang, 288 Zhaofeng Road, asks: A person suffers from severe tertiary syphilis, but it is inconvenient to seek medical treatment. He intends to focus on taking medication for self-treatment. He does not know what medicine he must take to gradually defeat the disease. Because this person previously suffered from "neurosyphilis," he was injected with about 40 needles of Jodisan and recovered. After five or six years, he suddenly suffered from hemoptysis and asthma, like "pulmonary tuberculosis"; however, the symptoms are ultimately not as severe as tuberculosis. Later, he learned that it was syphilis acting up! Due to financial difficulties, I implore a great doctor to prescribe several medications in detail for self-treatment, so as to kill the germs! (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>Answer: "Pulmonary syphilis" is quite dangerous. If left untreated, life is a concern. Although there is oral medication "Potasb Iodide", its effect is not obvious; if taken improperly, there are many dangers. Therefore, for the sake of your friend, it is not advisable to treat life as a child's play and begrudge an injection fee of ten or twenty yuan. Injections of "Arsphenamine" (606), five or six needles can gradually heal, each needle is only three yuan. Such is my sincere advice, that others may not dare to listen to. As for financial difficulties, this is a matter of the wider society and not within the scope of medicine.</p>
<p>Regarding Gonorrhea</p>
<p>No. 54, Mr. Li Wenhui, 162 Xinchang, Fujian Road, asks: I had intercourse with a prostitute a week ago, and developed acute gonorrhea four or five days later. Now I ask; (1) Is there hope for completely curing acute gonorrhea? How many days will it take! (2) Can it be cured with only injections and oral medication without electrotherapy? (3) Should leukorrhea be stopped? (4) It is appropriate to rest for gonorrhea, but it is not possible due to livelihood reasons. How many days at least must one rest before one can go out to work? (5) There is a small broken piece on the foreskin, is it a chancre? If it is not a chancre, can I get an injection to prevent chancres? What kind of powder should I apply to this broken piece? (6) From the fourth day after the onset of gonorrhea, a tendon connecting the penis and scrotum feels quite painful, as if pressing down hard with your hand when the penis is erect. It is most painful when sitting, and slightly felt when standing, but not at all when lying down. Is this phenomenon inflammation of the testicles? Or other changes—"neuralgia" or fatigue?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) It can be cured. Intensive treatment for three weeks to two months can cure it. (2) Injected drugs are the most important, followed by oral drugs. It must be washed after ten days. Electrotherapy is fundamentally without much basis in theory. (3) Of course it should be stopped. (4) Rest in bed for at least twenty days, until the phenomena of pain and fever have completely disappeared. (5) "Chancre" is hard, but the presence of breakage cannot be immediately determined as chancre. "Hard chancre" can be prevented by injecting "Carbisin", but soft ones cannot be prevented. "lodoform" dry powder can be used for broken pieces. (6) There is a high possibility of "orchitis", but if swelling of the testicles is not seen after two days, then it is not. "Gonorrheal anterior urethritis" also has this symptom.</p>
<p>Has the Gonorrhea Healed?</p>
<p>No. 55, (Sender's name and address kept secret) asks: In January of this year, I was seduced by bad friends to stay overnight with a prostitute, which resulted in leukorrhea flowing out of the glans. Four days later, I injected two boxes of "Gonacrindin" and took two bottles of "Sandal Mindi", and also performed washing (not electrotherapy). After ten days, it seemed to have improved slightly, with a small amount in the morning. There was quite a lot of turbidity in the urine. Knowing that the disease was not completely cured, I continued to take three boxes of double-dose "Lodinon" and two boxes of "Banti Pills", and continued washing for two or three months, but there are still turbid flocs in the urine now. (1) According to the above description, is the disease not completely eradicated, or is it an expected phenomenon after the disease? (2) What should be used if continued treatment is required? (3) Can I have sexual intercourse? (4) If the genitals are touched when erected (not sexual intercourse), semen is discharged, is this premature ejaculation? Is there any danger to the body? (5) What method should be used to treat this disease?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Turbidity in the urine is not necessarily a sign that the disease has not been completely eradicated. The urine should first be sent for examination to see what the turbid component is, whether it is protein, urate, epithelial cells, lipid, or pus and diplococci. (2) If the examination results show pus and diplococci, it is "chronic gonorrhea", and injections are not necessary, but oral "Tab-Sinoacrindin" and "Argent Protein 1% and Procain" can be used, warmed to thirty-seven degrees, and injected for washing twice a day. (3) Sexual intercourse can be performed if there is no pus or diplococci in the urine examination. (4) It is not premature ejaculation, it is urethral leakage! A sequela of gonorrhea—harmless, there is no sperm in it, only a small amount of epithelium, and the penis can still be erected. (5) This disease is harmless, it does not matter if it is not treated, and forcibly treating it can cause other diseases. If you must treat it, "Silver Nitrate Solution" can be dripped.</p>
<p>It is especially reliable to inject 50,000 bacteria of (Poligon) (Bailinkong) and then test the urine.</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>No. 56, Mr. Ke Tian, Gaochang Temple, asks: (1) My headache stops and starts, and it gets worse after labor. Is there a reliable treatment? (2) What is the reason for the pain on one side?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Take "lonbelin", two tablets each time, take it when it hurts. You must diagnose whether there are other diseases before taking the medicine. (2) This is called "migraine", it is a type of mental illness.</p>

<h3>Woman and Man</h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>According to reports, Miss Lanqiong, the capital of Hungary, underwent surgery a few months ago by a famous doctor and has transformed from a gentle and graceful lady into a heroic husband. The reason why that lady wanted to "undergo surgery" was "because she thought that transforming into a man would allow her to enjoy the rights and happiness of a man."</p>
<p>Of course, wanting to "transform into a man" is because she envies "the rights and happiness of a man." But what is so enviable about the so-called "rights and happiness of a man"? It is said: "Thinking that she can then take up a profession, (choose a man's profession), have a charming wife, and enjoy all the rights of a man."</p>
<p>It is naturally too abstract to answer with only "can choose a man's profession" and "have a charming wife," but from this we can also imagine the "happiness" of "a man's profession" and the suffering of being "a charming wife." Otherwise, I think that Miss Lanqiong, even if she was not wandering around "like a homeless dog," would not have spent several months "undergoing surgery."</p>
<p>I am not very clear about the national conditions of Hungary, but judging from it, the female occupations there should not be like ours, where women have few occupations other than masseuses, guides, and dancers, right? But even if it is developed, it is probably still a big difference compared to men, so Miss Lanqiong did not hesitate to "undergo surgery" to think about "changing from female to male" in order to "enjoy the rights and happiness of a man."</p>
<p>In addition to engaging in a profession, the only other path for women is to be "a charming wife" of "a man." According to Mr. Hitler, this is "the best occupation for a woman," and indeed many of our young mistresses live a life of eating, drinking, and playing outside of "raising sons," and live out their "best occupation" by "keeping to their place," but those are only the lives of a few parasites. The "Old Testament" also clearly tells us in "Genesis" that: "God also said to the woman,...your husband will rule over you," so it can be seen that being "a charming wife" is not so easy, the first thing is to be "ruled" by her husband.</p>
<p>Miss Lanqiong is probably also one who is unwilling to be "a charming wife" who is "a breeding machine," but since "a charming wife" is unwilling to be, and women's occupations are not as "happy" as "a man's profession," (as for "unemployment," it is originally the same for men and women, or it can be said that it is worse for women.) So "transforming into a man" and "enjoying all the rights of a man" is only human nature, and spending a few months "undergoing surgery" is naturally not counted.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, after "changing," she encountered obstacles everywhere. Her "opponents" all said that "women have women's lives and should be satisfied with the status quo, and at the same time, various factories have secretly agreed not to hire people who have changed from female to male," which made her "even more like a homeless dog, with nowhere to live," and finally had to "slightly reveal regret," thinking that "why bother with this extra effort."</p>
<p>Miss Lanqiong's regret about "doing this extra effort" is probably because after the gender change, "I am still not treated as a man." This is indeed "why bother with this extra effort." Bebel said in the first chapter of his medical book "Women and Society": "The status of women and workers has many similar places, but women have one thing that precedes workers? That is, they are the first humans to be enslaved! Before this kind of person as a 'slave' existed, women were already slaves." He also said: "All social subordination and oppression originate from the economic subordination of the oppressed to the oppressor. Women have long been in this position of economic subordination. This is the lesson that the history of the evolution of human society gives us."</p>
<p>Therefore, even if Miss Lanqiong has changed from female to male in terms of sex, and has smoothly "enjoyed all the rights of a man," if the problem of "economic subordination" is not resolved, her efforts will still be in vain.</p>
<p>Because: "Oppression is the common destiny of women and workers."</p>

<h3>In the Singapore Botanic Gardens</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Because I'm moving houses, I was reading my diary from five years ago. I was shocked: How ridiculous the "innocence" of young people is! Now, I am unemployed, and the depression is the same as it was five years ago; but the world has taught me another way of looking at things. I copied it out to warn myself, so as not to fall into "nihilism" again, and to show it from a third-person perspective as a type of struggling intellectual. Dissecting myself and dissecting society, I think it will be good for struggling today, right?</p>
<p>It was Sunday, and the weather was very gloomy. The whole day's sky was covered by gray clouds, and the city was depressed. My mood was like falling into a dark, bottomless abyss. I missed the deep autumn in my home country, the fallen leaves should be covering the ground, right? Like young companions scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>I happened to think of going to the Botanic Gardens, so I lazily strolled out of Middle Street and walked along the seashore. The sea was covered by gray clouds, and the lines on the surface were like the face of an old man, without sound or roar, like a dying old man full of twilight. I got on the bus at the headland protruding into the sea from the mouth of the Singapore River and set off for the suburbs.</p>
<p>The car drove through the island's suburban area, and the asphalt roads wound and intersected. The car was deserted, and villa-style Western houses were scattered on the small hills. Tropical red flowers were all over the roadside, and the flowers and plants around the villas all felt wilted and lifeless in the gloomy weather, completely losing the original vitality of equatorial plants. The sunlight was obscured, and Singapore shouldn't be obscured either. The bustling noise of the suburbs, right?</p>
<p>The car stopped at the entrance of the Botanic Gardens. I climbed out of the lonely carriage and entered the gate of the Botanic Gardens alone. A small asphalt road unfolded before my eyes, and in front of me were small grass paths that diverged in all directions. Palm trees unfurled their umbrella-shaped leaves, and many needle-shaped plants rose with tall, thin trunks. The big banyan tree occupied a large area on the ground, and its drooping gray-black roots were deeply buried underground: The coconut trees, however, raised their sturdy treetops, preparing to climb high into the sky. Weak plants crept weakly underground, or stretched out their long, drooping grass-like leaves in glass houses. Betel nut trees spewed fragrance from their yellow-white flower balls. Through the birdsong, the fragrance was a bit like the fragrance of osmanthus in my hometown.</p>
<p>The Botanic Gardens on a Sunday afternoon had never been so desolate. Looking at the diverging flower paths, there were no pedestrians. The weather was gloomy enough to remind me of the deep autumn days in my home country, and the vast trees were blown by the breeze, emitting a sad and cold air.</p>
<p>Passing by the outside of the tea shed where tourists ate and drank, the lonely tables and chairs were covered in white, emitting a cold light. There was no one in the shed, reminding me how few people were visiting the garden today. Wearing a cool, see-through white outfit, I walked alone through the trees to the edge of a rather desolate pond. Sitting on the backrest chair facing the pond, a small bird was startled and flew away, skimming the water surface from the leaves of the aquatic plants, and then passed through the grass and disappeared into the distance. The grass rustled in the breeze.</p>
<p>I sank into fantasy. My heart was empty and very dazed, but it was also chaotic and clueless. Letting memories gnaw in my heart, stories of young people rolled around in my mind. Every single thought was untrustworthy: just as it flew across my mind, it flew away again.</p>
<p>"Ah, motherland! Ah, family! Ah, friends!...The rush of life, the flow of body and mind...Ah, when will I have a sweet and quiet realm?"</p>
<p>"The chaos before my eyes, the constant groping. Ah, let the gray clouds blow away the shadows of the past; ah, let the scorching sun of the equator illuminate the nothingness at the bottom of my heart."</p>
<p>So, petrified was my body: numb was my hot blood. Letting the gloomy time fly by on the backrest chair, letting the years of setbacks and the shadows of the soul disappear from the Botanic Gardens.</p>
<p>Then dusk came, and gray clouds covered black patches again. Another day's time has passed, and the shadow of the Botanic Gardens has consumed half a day of my time.</p>
<p>"What is tomorrow? What is tomorrow?" I muttered to myself. I lazily stood up, strolled out of the park gate, and took a car back home.</p>
<h3>Relocation</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>——Mountain City Miscellany——</p>
<p>I only stayed in the public building for two days. In the morning, after getting up, seeing the people entering and exiting this doorway, I couldn't help but have to "greet the foreigners." The number of people wasn't small. Although I couldn't distinguish their seniority or the extent of their friendship, and although I couldn't figure out how to address their honorable names, just a brief conversation of four or five sentences, maintaining the "reciprocity" of etiquette, was exhausting. Not to mention having a long conversation.</p>
<p>That night, after discussion, Lao Tie and I moved out of the public building and went to stay at an inn.</p>
<p>The inn was located diagonally across from the public building, not far away. It was also a two-story building, but the term "two-story" cannot be compared to Shanghai. At the entrance, there was a counter where people greeted the merchants coming and going. Beside it was a wide passage. Passing through the passage, there was a large courtyard. Further inside, along the small paths on both sides, was the two-story building where we were lodging.</p>
<p>When we first arrived, we were very curious: why couldn't we see any other merchants staying here? Why was there no furniture in the guest hall downstairs? Why were flammable and dangerous items like kerosene and cloth allowed to lean against the corner of the room? And why were the counter clerk and the owner making faces at us?… We knew that strangers couldn't immediately understand these things. Never mind, let's stay and see!</p>
<p>The room was indeed not small, with two large rooms, inner and outer. Judging by area alone, it would cost more than three silver dollars a day in Shanghai. As for the interior furnishings, the level of simplicity was also noteworthy. Apart from two wooden plank beds, an old-fashioned three-drawer desk with carved foot panels underneath, and two small round stools and a tea table, there was nothing else. Fortunately, it was summer. Otherwise, with the broken window panels and the narrow, dark alley just outside, the cold wind blowing from the rooftops of other people's houses would be unbearable. The floor was level, but the softness of the springs made us uneasy. Who knew if we might sink into them inexplicably while talking or sleeping.</p>
<p>Here, although there were no written rules for guests, you had to be careful in everything you did. When walking and washing your face, you had to be as quiet as a thief, preferably without making a sound. If your footsteps were a little heavy or water splashed outside the basin, there would be a loud outcry from downstairs – "Water is dripping into the bowl upstairs! Ashes are getting in my eyes!"</p>
<p>In the evening, if you wanted to take a refreshing bath to wash away the sweat-soaked body, it was simply a dream. In reality, you were not allowed such freedom, unless it was after everyone in the shop had fallen asleep in the quiet of the night. Secondly, there was the matter of relieving oneself. In this place, there were no chamber pots. The entire inn had only one pool, filled with the different substances excreted by everyone. Moreover, this pool was in the small back courtyard. During the day, it didn't seem so bad, but at night, without streetlights, you had to take a torch and walk through the dark courtyard. The terror pressing on your heart made the situation truly frightening. Considering the "staying conditions," what could you do?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it shouldn't be a complaint about the simplicity of the inn. In terms of development, the baptism of civilization had not yet entered this remote mountain country. The rustic atmosphere filled everyone's heart. Life was quite poor. Staying at the inn, this place was not a place for leisure. Each day, including the room rate, only cost five dimes in silver dollars.</p>
<p>However, the mountain country was barren. The price of five dimes a day couldn't attract many passing merchants!</p>
<h3>Fugitive (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mei Ping</p>
<p>But a sudden, urgent gunshot rang out in the sky, as if hitting his body, and he immediately hid in the haystack, afraid to move, afraid to breathe. The blood rushed in his veins, almost exploding. He looked up at the watchtower, where bright lights had already been lit and voices were rising. Furthermore, silhouettes of people were moving to and fro along the city walls. Clearly, they had discovered the route the fugitive had taken. Therefore, a spirit of survival encouraged him to run through the haystack. He dared not raise his head, letting the merciless thorns prick at his eyes.</p>
<p>The north gate of the city opened, and a team of watchmen with torches rushed out of the city, bayonets fixed to their rifles. Everyone sniffed through the haystacks like hunting dogs, searching for their quarry. The autumn wind at dawn stirred the waves of grass, often eliciting their crude shouts: "Come out! We'll shoot!" But there was no movement in the haystacks, so they really fired a shot forward with a "bang"…</p>
<p>Gunshots, voices, torches, raged outside the north gate until dawn broke.</p>
<p>The prisoner escaped the haystacks, escaped the bayonets of his pursuers. Now he sat under a collapsed house a few yards from the pier, stroking the wounds on his skin. The bloodstains dried, then flowed again. He thought about the danger of being arrested if he appeared at the pier in this condition. The first ship was blowing its whistle. Perhaps the pier was already abuzz with news of last night's search for the fugitive by the military police. Perhaps military police with fixed bayonets were already inspecting every passenger boarding the ship. Perhaps the watchmen had already left the north gate and were searching their way through the haystacks. Perhaps… Thinking of this, he felt that it had really been a</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>foolish act to risk so much to escape from prison. He was convicted of robbery and sentenced to three months in prison. Three months was the shortest period of time in his life, and wasn't life in prison better than wandering the streets every day? He could hear the bell and eat a meal of rice and two meals of congee every day. He had rarely had such comfortable days in the past. So why couldn't he quietly spend ninety days? Asking himself this, he immediately wanted to surrender. As long as the judge didn't sentence him to death, he was willing to accept any length of imprisonment.</p>
<p>As quickly as when he had escaped, he stood up, but before he could take a step, he fell to the ground again. His legs and feet were wounded by thorns. He had endured all the pain earlier because he had to escape, but now he felt that his legs could not move another step.</p>
<p>The first ship blew its whistle again, and he watched the thick black smoke pouring out of the smokestack as it sailed out of the harbor into the river of freedom. The sun rose in the east, its intense rays stinging his eyes, making it impossible for him to open them. It was as if the sun, after being separated for a few days, was no longer the same sun he used to sit under at the foot of the city wall, picking lice. His stomach was even more painfully hungry. He thought he heard a sound like music, the sound of the breakfast bell in the prison. So he crawled out from under the house and sat in the bright sunlight, hoping someone at the pier would see him immediately, or that the watchmen in the haystacks were already hiding behind him. He was willing to accept the judgment of the law, which was precisely designed for people like him. He wanted to eat, he was hungry…</p>
<h3>Siblings</h3>
<p>— Ma Jia</p>
<p>The older brother was about nine years old, named Zhen Tong. His younger sister was probably six or seven years old. I didn't know her name. Her innocent little face was just as lovely as her brother's. Her brother studied at our elementary school. As soon as I saw her, I said to her, "Hey! Little sister! Come, come and study here with us!" A happy smile immediately appeared on her little face. As she nodded at me, the sweet smile on her face vanished in an instant. A six- or seven-year-old child actually said to me like this: "Teacher! We have no money." I remembered that her brother was a "free student" at our school. I stared at her for a while, and my voice was clearly trembling. I said to her, "Come and study, we won't charge you tuition." A happy smile appeared before my eyes again, but suddenly, she turned and ran away. I heard her say, "I'll go tell Mom."</p>
<p>The father of this innocent pair of siblings was a fruit vendor. I had also seen their mother, a middle-aged woman with a sallow, sickly face. I remember very clearly: on the first day of school, their father walked into the office with a one-dollar bill in his hand, nervously and hesitantly, and said to our principal in a pleading tone: "Teacher: let this one dollar be considered a small token of my appreciation!" Our principal always said, "Forget it! Forget it! We don't want your money." Only then did he seem relieved, bowing, thanking us, and backing out to the school gate.</p>
<p>But the next day, Zhen Tong's younger sister did not come. Not only did she not come, but her brother did not come either. I was surprised: because Zhen Tong had never missed a day of school. By the afternoon, I learned from the other children that Zhen Tong's father had tried to rob someone on the road to pay three months' rent and had been arrested. At the time, I was very surprised. At the same time, I was worried about the future of that innocent pair of siblings.</p>
<p>For two months, Zhen Tong did not come to school, and I had forgotten about the innocence of his younger sister. Occasionally, I saw her in the alley, and she would quickly run away, as if she were ashamed of her father's robbery. I sighed softly, and I also unconsciously walked past her quickly: I had become afraid to see her too.</p>
<p>One morning, Mom told me that innocent little child, Zhen Tong's mother, had died! "What?" I was shocked. Mom said, "She died of tuberculosis, dry blood tuberculosis!" I didn't pity the sick, sallow-faced middle-aged woman. On my heart, I can never forget that pair of sisters.</p>
<p>At around one o'clock, I had an outing. I encountered the coffin of that middle-aged woman being carried away. Zhen Tong and his younger sister followed sadly behind the coffin. It was so cold and desolate, unnoticed, that the middle-aged woman was carried away.</p>
<p>Another tragedy had been added to the world. My tears almost rolled down. That day, I was silent and thoughtful. I couldn't help but worry about the future of those two innocent siblings. Alas! They would become wandering street children! At the thought of the little beggars at the bridgehead, I really wanted to cry out loud for the fate of those two siblings.</p>
<p>Later, my mother told me that the two children had been taken away by their uncle, who also lived in our alley. My heart was much relieved. I blessed their unfortunate fate to improve.</p>
<p>This is not a fatalistic saying: "Their lives are destined to be bitter." The roots of the misfortune of so many unfortunate people can be found in this irrational society. A week later, I heard from my mother again, saying: "Their uncle was also arrested for robbing people on the road."</p>
<p>Now, these two children: a nine-year-old boy and a six- or seven-year-old girl, let them struggle with this environment in Shanghai. I can only hope that they will not be crushed by the environment. I can no longer express my useless "humanitarianism" with sadness. Isn't that so? This world is full of countless children living in that so-called unfortunate fate?</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Simple Prodigy"</p>
<p>A gust of west wind blows across the east. At the foot of the small bridge, I met an old fisherman. Three meals a day are always provided. I am, exerting every effort to study. Suddenly, I heard three knocks on the wattle gate. I saw torches and lanterns densely packed. The servants and maids all scattered. Alone, only the young lady remained. Could it be, that close friends had come to tease? Could it be, that demons from the mountains had appeared? The young lady is, calling her husband. Not truly from illicit affairs. I am not an unknown woman. My father is called Ma Rong in the court. Coveting wealth, they want to offer me, offer me to Liang Ji as his fourth concubine. I am unwilling to follow a traitor. Therefore, I, wrote a poem on the wall. Cleverly seen by my father. Great thunder broke in his brain. He sent the steward to arrest me. Clearly to offer me to the prime minister. Jian Sheng listened, his face red. Thinking of the thousand gold, why must you enter the tongue prison? Thinking of the young lady, living in a high house at home, it is difficult to face a house with collapsed walls and leaking roof. The young lady is served by maids and servants at home, but it is difficult to live in a room with only a lonely lamp.
