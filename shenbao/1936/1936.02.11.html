<p>拉氏指明一月二十九日上午九時滿軍侵入蘇境、而衝突發生乃在滿軍直向伏洛希羅夫城進發三十小時以後、「由是觀之、所謂在蘇聯境內追趕滿軍之說、完全無稽、故與一八三七年事伴亦無相同之點、南大將已承認侵入蘇聯邊境、而世界輿論對於何人破壞遠東和平、何人正在弄火生事一點、已得淸楚答覆」云、（八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>農村經濟業談</h3>
<p>— 俞慶棠主編</p>
<h3>久違了的故鄉宜興　（續）</h3>
<p>— 企之</p>
<p>細細的分拆，覺得貧窮的原因至少有這幾個：　工業品（許多是洋貨）流入農村。對於一般農民，布·火柴·火油·膠鞋·洋襪等等，現在已成必需向市塲購買的日用品，自己絕對不自給了。而時鐘，無綫電收音機，（已很普及於宜興各鄉了P村就有七八架。）熱水瓶·皮鞋·綢緞呢絨·毛絨綫·牙膏·保安剃刀·自來水筆·打氣爐·味精·餅干·電筒·呢帽·草帽·等等不下百數十種，農民雖未見識過，但也成了地主們的日用必需品。這些，都是直接簡接由農民用穀子換來的。農民耕的還是那塊地而沒有其他收入，穀價又因爲洋米洋麥的傾銷價格日落。工業品的流入的種類和數量又一天天增多，這樣鄉問安得不窮？　機器代替了人工，而人工勞力又賣不出去。機器戽水和輾米在這幾年中已由無錫常州流行到宜興各鄉來了。P村就有兩組戽水機（該機在冬季卽改爲輾米機）。附近稻田都灌溉，大都由這兩個機戶（一個是木作主，一個是地主同時是商人）承包，平均每畝田出錢二元，稻田從揷秧以後到收穫爲止，機戶負責不使稻田缺水。輾起米來，每機每小時可輾十餘石，每石收費不到一角。這都比入工省錢省事在一倍以上。種田的業主固然因爲用了機器卽可以少用人工也就是節少費用，但對勞動的農人講，他的工作被機器占去了，也就是他收入的一部份被機器奪去了。如果他們因爲不戽水而可以穫得其他工作得到報酬，對他每年的收入不生影響。無奈在都市中的民族工業，被帝國主義商品壓迫得奄奄一息，只有减工沒有擴充的現狀之下，只有失業工人回鄉沒有失業農民在城市立足的可能。所以農民的收入白白的被機器奪去而得不到補償。而造機器所用的鋼鐵和機器消耗的柴油等都是外國貨，所以農民被機器奪去的金錢，大部也簡接的流入外國了。這樣農村安得不窮？　農民繳納租稅於政府，但政府幷不把稅收用之於農民。農民繳納租稅最多的是地稅（田賦）。在我們家鄉，田每畝每年納田賦共計一元五角左右，要占到每畝總收益的百分之十五至二十。這是農村的一個鉅大支出。（不管這田賦是由地主或其他什麼人的手中支出，最後負担還是在勞動的農民）。省和縣政府拿了這筆錢，不管作生產建設費購買外國機器工具也好，辦敎育也要，作爲行政費也好，能仍舊流回農村的只是政府機關人員用以購買米糧蔬菜這一小部份。其他的直接或簡接流到外國去了，卽使機關人員有些是從農村中來，但他們絕不再用他們積蓄再投資於農村，幷且也無處可投。大都存欵於銀行或錢莊。這些錢不流入農村的再生流過程中去了。這樣有出無進，結果農村安得不窮？有這三種原因，在這個整個農村收支上講，旣無源可開，而流又非但不能節反有日見擴大的趨勢。近三年來絲價慘跌，農民蠶業的失敗，做了鄉村經濟崩潰的誘發原因。結果農村一天天的貧乏，自然金融差不多完全枯竭了，農村愈窮，再生產的資本愈少（P村上就有不少農戶種田而無力購買肥料的）收穫也愈少，農村因之愈貧。農村金融愈緊，高利貸愈盛行，農村的支出愈大。（P村近來帮的勢力大盛。因該帮主代理無錫某高利貸者在春荒時放米。放時米一石作價十元，要比市價貴一二元，到秋收還稻，稻價只作三元，比時價低數角，再加利息，結果借一石米半年後要還四石稻。農民因借貸無門，都迫得拜他做老頭子，這樣方才借得到米）如是愈演愈烈，農村也愈演愈窮了。</p>
<p>近年來政府及財界諸公努力提倡合作社，農村放欵等，卽使都能做得盡善盡美，（事實上可批評之處甚多）也只能對於高利貸和商人的掠奪减少了一些，而對於上述構成農村經濟崩潰三個原因，並未動共分毫，所以對於完成救濟農村這個任務，能盡了多大一點力呢？</p>
<p>四，</p>
<p>最後還有些零碎的感想。在鄉間，在二十歲以下的女子都已天足，所以使她們有同男子一樣操作的條件。有些靑年女子已做着挑擔耕作這一類的工作，是以前P村沒有的。這使她們得到用以獲得和男子經濟平等的立足點。已有些妻子在督促她嬾惰的丈夫的了。這也不能不說是中國婦女解放運動中的一個成績。</p>
<p>去年宜興受螟災頗烈，有些地方受害比一九三四年的旱災還厲害，農民只知道做會演劇酬神，不知道用燈火或掘根等科學方法消滅它（這種方法要大規模做才有效，卽使農民知道了也無力做到）。在我從鄉間出來的一天經過蜀山鈸時，看見牆壁有許多印得很講究，寫着「要增加稻的生產，必須消滅螟虫」，「要滅螟虫，必須把稻根掘出焚掉」等一類標語，才知道一個除瞑運動才過了。</p>
<p>一位在P村行醫的醫師告訴我許多她行醫的經騐，這對於注意鄉村衛生的人很有趣味：她說鄉下人（指成人）的病大都是些厲害的傳染病，如肺病（眞正農民很少）夏秋的瘧疾，痢疾，霍亂，腸熟病，角膜炎，等等。感冒，神精衰弱，消化不良等都市最時髦的病却不大有。花柳病現在逐年增加了。鄉下人對西醫不一定就是反對而迷信着神巫和中醫。第一個問題錢的問題，許多鄉下都因爲沒有錢，卽使有病如果不到十二分嚴重，（允其是女孩子）也不請敎醫生，卽使求醫也往便宜的地方走。西醫的診費和藥都是很貴的。她在那裏不收診費，藥費也看人而收，所以生意很好（只是賺不到錢）。第二確有些醫術很高明的專科中醫，西醫眞是手段高强的，比同樣易得人信仰。</p>
<p>許多我從前初等小學裏的同學都已長大，或已兒女成行了。各照着各的家境，有的做了鄉鎭長，或者所謂「先生」，有的成爲生產過程中的中堅。在我離開家鄉的前一天，由於被孩童時代的美麗的回憶尋花玩水等所喚起，想再去遊一遊十年前山中　蘭，林間玩溪水的那些地方。到了山上，遇到一個以前同座的小同學。他在那裹樵柴，相見之下也還的略認得。時間的更迭和大家生活的改變，使以前的伙伴互相生疏似乎中間隔了一層厚大的玻璃牆壁，招呼之後便沒有什麼話可想出，不得不相顧一笑而別。從他而部表情上似乎因爲沒有力量中學大學畢業，在外面弄得一官半職，仍舊把鋤操鐮而慚愧。當時使我覺得很雖以爲情。他那種壯健，樸質，誠懇的態度和表情，印象很深且將永遠在我的心中。（完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（七）（三）</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>想到另一個爸爸，昨晚離開了他的孩子們，而且永不再回來了，使得裴先生緊緊抱住他自己的孩子，埋藏他的臉在羅勃鬆曲的頭髮裏，的有不少的時間。愛彌俯頭在他的臂上，拂朗放他的頭在他伯伯的肩上，他那童子式的臉也竟因同情與憂鬱而轉蒼白，別的人也只坐着，嘿不作聲，一時室中惟有靜寂，所以鬥外落葉到地之聲亦竟淸晰可聽。</p>
<p>羅勃不明瞭究竟是什麼一回事，可是他看見爸爸不快樂，所以他抬起了低落的頭，用他小鳥一般的聲昔，夾雜了德國的方言說道：</p>
<p>「不要哭；麥恩父！我們都很好，你不在，我們也做了功課，拂划做老帥」。（註）</p>
<p>裴先生於是仰起頭來，勉作徵笑，幷以感激的聲情說道：『我眞謝謝你們，我的孩子們。這們這麼帮助我，安慰我，眞是一件美妙的事。我對你們說，我是决不會忘記的。」孩子們聽了，覺得他們自己竟如聖人一般。</p>
<p>乃德說道：『拂朗發起的，他幷是個一等的敎師呢』。別人聽了，也點首道是，這使那個小先生聽了，是十分意滿的。</p>

<p>申報醫藥專刊亟應提倡農村護士（上）  殷金泉　　　我國自古以來，以農立國，全國人民中有百分之八十五以上的農民，所以我國農村問題，就是整個國家問題。此一般人的視綫，皆移轉到復興農村問題上來，我國有好多政治家，敎育家，以及研究農村問題的各種專家，曾經硏究過，認爲我國農民有四個最大的疾病，就是「貧」「愚」「私」「弱」，所以河北定縣平民敎育促進會，欲挽救這四大疾病，曾擬定四大敎育方針，以生產敎育治「貧」，以平民敎育治「愚」，以公民敎育治「私」，以公共衛生治「弱」，然欲復與農村，雖賴各方俱進，而其中允爲重耍的，實爲衛生問題，我國農村衛生不良，實爲我國貧弱的主因，所以促進農村衛生之工作，爲我國當前急務，乃是不可否認的事實，爲欲辦理農村衛生，又不能不將眼光轉向農民生活狀况，及農村社會的情形，茲將作者親目所見之事實，述其四點於后：　　　農民智諳是淺陋到極黑，對於新近的學諳，毫無認諳，因此什麽新醫咧，衛生咧，都不是他們期望享受的，所謂飮食衛生，他們根本不明白，生水是他們臨時解渴的飮料，食品雖隔着十頭八天將要腐敗，他們也不忍傾去，否則恐得罪於天，因此疾病容易向他們光臨，遭遇了病後，憑着平素勞苦練得來的銅筋鐵骨去支持，與病魔作戰，得不到正當的醫療，病症輕的，多受些痛苦自然可愈，病症重的，惟有滿腔悲憤靜候着死神來光臨，或張惶失措，東去求神問卜，西訪仙丹神方，化了許多瞎頭錢，直至命卒也不明白，以爲壽命如此，這種寃死是多麼的可憐。　　　最勤努的是農民，最痛苦的也就是農民，這數年來，天災人禍，以致民不聊生，生活難顧，那裏還顧及到衛生呢？不工作便不能持生，所以帶病工作的很多，你若跨進農村的境域，隨處可以見到面黃飢瘦的人們，仍如牛馬式似的在整天工作着，工作效能當然不能增多，生產自然减少，生活日漸窘乏，這是當然的事，有了病那裏能享受現代貴族式的醫院治療呢？　　　我國有四萬萬人民，所需醫師當然很多，可是據最近衛生署統計，合格醫師尚不滿四千人，且這數目很少的醫師當中，多集於都市，農村幾無可見，這是我國醫界畸形的發展，農村中醫院，更加罕見了，所以農村雖有認識新醫的，去請求新醫亦不可得，所以遭遇着疾病，便得不到新醫的保障，若赴都市就診，又因交通不便，但擔任不了貴昂的醫藥費，更談不到請醫師至家診察了，所以得了病，勢非請求玄醫，或求神問卜不可了。　　　農民旣不懂得衛生，又沒有衛生保障的設施，遭遇着傳染的病症，又不知道隔離的方法，勢必廣汎的傳佈開來，造成全村農民之恐佈慘劇，使多數人民蒙其毒害，發生一决虎疫，就可死亡許多生產的農民，流行一决天花，就可傷害無數寳貴的小農，談虎變色，這是很顯明的例子，其死亡於無智識接生婆手中的，更不知其數了。　　農村衛生情形及農民生活的痛苦，旣如上述，我人豈忍再緩辦理農村衛生呀！以種種方面看來，辦理農村衛生，爲復興農村最切迫的問題，舉國當前之急務，再無可諱言了。色盲的話  郭柏霖　　　色盲的異常　　當我們欲視某種色彩的時候則必要有某種程度的光綫。原因是光綫若不充分，色調便會發生變化。譬如在薄暮時紅色最不容易辨認，他如明亮處紅色比靑色光亮，但黑暗處紅色却反黯淡了。　　這樣，普通人之中，雖然也有生理的地出現的患者，但是如果光錢是充分，然猶不能作紅色與綠色或與灰色的區別，因此認靑葉爲紅葉，或認紅葉爲靑葉，或者視未熟的果實爲已熟，視已熟爲未熟，乃至靑色與黃色不能分辨的時候，顯然是色覺已有異常的瞪據。　　若爲先天性的色盲，則因無其他眼疾症狀，且無妨碍日常生活，故大多數都在他覺的底狀態下受過檢查之後始而判明的。　　色覺異常的種類　　色覺異常之中，有色盲與色弱。又色盲之中，有——　　一·不能區別紅色與綠色與灰色者　　二·不能辨認靑色與黃色者　　三·全然分不出色彩者　　等；並且這中間，尚有先天性與後天性的二種類之分。　　先天性色盲　　所謂先天性色盲，卽係受諸雙親的遺傳。其中有；　　　根據雙親的血族結婚而全色盲者所謂全色盲，乃係觀看外界的時候，好像吾人視照相一樣，只能感到明暗與濃淡，例如靑色明朗，紅色黯淡，視力亦弱，不能觀望遠方。在光亮的地方有羞明，非細眼視物不可。又有眼球震盪。　　　雙親的一方，或者兩方均患有色盲，或擁有潛伏性色盲因子的時候，其子女則必出現色盲。　　這時節的色盲之中，紅綠色盲最爲多頻，且其出現方法又有五種。　　（一）色盲的父親與健康的母親之間所出的兒童，無論是男或女，均都不會出現色盲，惟女子則無一能倖免色盲因子的潛伏。　　（二）潛伏有色盲遺傳質的母親與健康的父親之間所出的兒童，其男兒的半數有色盲的出現，女兒雖全部沒有異狀，可是其半數却擁有遺傳質的潛伏性色盲。　　（三）潛伏有色盲遺傳質的母親，與患有色盲的父親之問所生的兒童，男兒的半數有色盲，女兒的表面雖無色盲，可是却潛伏着。　　（四）色盲的母親，與健康的父親之間所出的兒童，男兒全數有色盲，女見表面上雖完全健康，但却完全潛伏有色盲因子。　　（五）色盲的母親，與色盲的父親之間所出的兒童，無論是男是女，都完全色盲。　　色盲的罹患數　　如上面所示的一樣，女子的色盲頗少，不及男子的十分之一。而男子之中，的有百分之四·五，卽二十二三人中有一人色盲。至於女子之所以比男子色盲少數的原因，並不是色盲的遺傳能力對於女子薄弱，只是一邊出現在外部，一邊則潛伏在內部而已。　　後天性色盲（色弱）　　有非先天性遺傳，而根摟某種原因，辨別色彩極感困難的塲合，此卽所謂後天性色盲，亦稱色弱。症狀雖無先天性色盲那樣厲害，但是無論如何對於色彩的區別頗爲遲鈍。　　眼球之中司色覺的部份，卽是眼球後壁的網膜。而此網膜之中，其中央部對於色彩最爲銳敏。所以如果有侵犯網膜，特別是其中央部的疾病，或者患有其他如視神經疾患的時候，色視野便因此而告减退或消失，結果對於色彩的區別感到困難，甚至不能辨認了。　　種類原因及療法　　　不能作紅色與綠色的區別之中，有視神經的疾患：例如脚氣，視神經炎，鬱血乳頭，視神經萎縮症等。　　　不能辨認靑色與黃色的疾病，是基因於網膜脈胳膜的疾患。例如網膜脈胳膜炎或網膜胳膜萎縮等。　　後天性色弱，卽是專心作誘起其疾患的原病的治療爲要緊，可是根據遺傳的所謂先天性色盲的療法，却迄今尚未被發現。　　色盲患者，對於色彩，譬如紅色，綠色，或者黃色等，雖一律只視爲灰色，可是實際上尚能辨認濃薄與明淡，所以若根據非色盲之人的此係紅色，彼爲綠色等之指導，或者根據其濃淡而區別其爲某種色彩等，這樣練習起來，至某種程度的識別是可能的。總之，色盲如前面的所述，男子每二十二三人中有一人，而女子則每二百二三十人中有一人，並且此種疾患又非單限於遺傳，他如所謂後天性，根據脚氣，網膜炎等疾病而惹起色盲的塲合也有，故若患有色盲的患者，則必先探究其係出於某種原因，然後從速施行適切而有效的治療。白帶之新療法  瞿紹衡　　　德國名興大學產婦科敎室R．Koelsch．氏於一百五十名之婦科病人中七十四人發見Trichomonas而卽以是爲白帶之原因雖其確爲固有病原與吾尚有異論紛爭。然因Trichomonas之存在而陰道壁Glykogem消失之結果。以致正常陰道菌叢之生存條發生惡影響且其組織之抵抗力亦被同時滅殺而爲病原二决感染。大開方便之門。則已爲不可掩飾之事實　　Trichomonas之證明法以於暗視野行之最爲適宜。其法用白金耳由陰道壁採取少量分泌物。以之混和於豫加一滴食鹽水之普通載物玻璃上。而依普通檢查法檢查之。則見Trichomonas以鞭毛自由運動。狀若梨子。其大小較白血球稍大或則各自運動於上皮塊間。或則集合而成一塊。　　Trichomonas陰道炎之特徵。爲此項陰道炎非用特異療法。决不全治。卽通常所用藥物洗滌療法。銀浴，白陶土乾燥療法，全身强壯療法，刺戟療法，無論論單用併用。絕不能使Trichomonas陰道炎全治者也。至多不過有三四日之輕快。而陰道炎依然復發矣。　　Gelhorn氏曾以「　　　　　」之吹入療法。瞪得奇效。Koelsch氏則用</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （朱瘦桐）　　在家靠父母；出外靠朋友」。這兩句話，雖然極平常的口頭語，他細想來，竟是十足表現着依賴的惡劣心理。我們旣經自認爲男子漢，應當憑着自己的學識，增進那生活的技能，把勞力換來的酬報，來侍奉父母，來帮助朋友，自捫良心，方才可以不覺得慚愧。　　我願一般受不了環境壓迫，欲圖自殺的朋友們，趕快振作精神，把那最後的勇氣，來打開當前的困難，脚踏實地的努力邁進，總有達到勝利的一天，何必要逃避實現呢。　　我們不要單是批評人家，責備人家，我們先要設身處地的代人家想一想，然後再下斷語，方能恰當，公平。俗語說：「看人挑擔弗吃力，自上肩頭活壓殺」，便是對着那些徒逞意氣的人們的忠告。　　人人忠於自己的責任，安心服務，不做那社會上的寄生蟲，已是盡了做人的一部分的義務了。性喜揮霍的孩子  霞飛　　　日前報載：已故前淸李鴻章之曾孫李道紃，現在祇有十五歲，而每年揮霍須達二三萬元，在上海一般銷金之窟，消魂之塲，時常有他的蹤跡出入。所以他雖肄業於某中學之初中部，可是爲了性躭遊戲，怠於學業，故毫無成績。最近他的家屬鑒於他這樣下去，不免日趨墮落；因此便將他送到漕河涇上海遊民習勤所里去，以冀改造共身心，而可學習技能。　　這件事在社會上我想會給一般人認爲奇怪的，因爲以一堂堂相國後裔而竟送入遊民習勤所去，與一些遊民乞丐爲伍，那委實是一件新聞，其實依我看來，並不覺得什麼稀罕，一個靑年不習上，理應讓他去受點敎訓。　　不過話得拉回來說的，他這樣小小年紀竟會年耗二三萬元，倒底是誰造成他的？家庭？社會？—嚴格的說一句，還不是這家庭的不良環境所使之的。如果他出生窮苦人家，卽使要想揮霍亦無從了，况且這麼年紀也决不會有巨額的金錢任他支取的啊！有人說，做官的只要把良心移開，那末包可妻財子祿，一世吃穿不窮；觀乎此，怪不得古今的中國人大家都想做官了。　　但是，李氏家屬雖然錯誤在前，然而此舉却還不失爲有見地。齷齪財神  淸癯　　　財神，大家都知道，不過應時的一句好口采，所以說出財神兩個字來，到了現在，還沒有人肯打破咧！因爲這樣，我就想到小東門的一位「齷齪財神，」把他的歷史，寫在下面，給閱者們看看。責任重大　　這位財神，並不是泥塑，也不見廟貌魏峨的形式，他的圖形，盡在一垜牆壁上，喂！往往到了廢歷元旦一天，和初五一天，香烟繚繞，喃喃膜拜於其飾的，眞不知有多少？而且牆壁上，還懸掛着許多匾額，什麼「有求必應」等等字樣，那末：這位財神，到底有怎樣的靈感，要受人信仰的如此呢？　　我曾經聽得老於滬上的朋友說過，大的方纔開埠的時候，有粵人某姓，經商以後，居然積資鉅萬，而他的性情，允歡喜揮霍，故終年出入花叢中，凡是北里著名的歌妓，都不惜千金一擲，不料後來生意不佳，虧損無補，到了某年的歲底，竟背入畢命於黃海江邊，隨波臣而長逝了。　　從此靑樓姊妹，思念恫切，一到元旦和財神誕日，遂麕集於小東門傍，設位以祭之，但不肯說某之姓氏，大家尊之爲財神，後來因爲地處卑汚，行人又都以便溺相加，竟名爲「齷齪財神；」共實眼前希望儻來，而爭先接財神的人們，他的心理，也未必十分潔凈吧！小西天  張恨水著　　　第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴　傾壼聯舊好利可忘嫌　　他才笑道：兩位王先生都是正人君子，我這不過是受人之託，出來作這一件事，又不是地皮販子。當然買地皮的人，要另用一副眼光來接洽。若是像金子强先生那樣相待，當然是……哈哈！他是我的朋友，我也不便說什麼。不過二位王先生請放心，我决不欺騙人。火車通到西安，大概還要十個月左右，通到咸陽，那就難說了。不過火車通到了西安以後，說是商業立刻發達起來，那也不見得。商業雖是午頭萬緒的事情，總不外乎兩個原則。其一是把外面的貨物，運到陝西來推銷，其二是把陝西的物產，向外面運出去。陝西的情形，你二位比我明白一萬倍，人民是連飢寒兩個字，都免除不了，那裏有錢買外來的東西。至於本省的物產，陝北和漢中的東西，都沒有法子運到關中來。關中出的物產，也不過是棉花大麥吧？似乎也經不得火車幾天搬運。至於烟土，倒是一種大宗出品，你想能用火車裝運嗎？所以在進出口兩方面，都沒有振興商業的理由。旣是商業不容易振興，說是在這裏開公司，能够大發其財，那似乎也是一句揣想的話。他口裏這樣說着，眼睛是不住的看二王的顏色。見他們都有些動容，心裏就很是高興，便呌店伙來商量了幾樣菜，吩咐快快做工。實誠笑道：統共三個人，賈先生把菜要得太多了，五個菜一個湯，我們怕吃不了。北海聽他這，一番話，覺得他也不是不能講理的人。而况他又十分的客氣，也就不能只記看他的壞處，順便就和他說了幾句應酬話。賈多才更是笑容收不住，只誇他是個有為的靑年。一會子功夫，店伙送上酒菜來，他就先把北海面前的杯子取過來，斟了一杯酒，起身　着腰送了過去，笑道：今天不恭得很，只有隨便的幾樣菜。不過彼此早已認識，總沒有交談，却是憾事。現在我們成了朋友，我是十分的痛快，別的不用說，我們先痛飲三杯。王北海見他這樣恭敬，實在不忍太給人家臉子來看，便笑道：我不過是代表同族的人出來接洽一種買賣。要不然，一個當窮學生的人，對於你這樣的資本家，我是攀交不上。賈多才笑道：我們旣然是成了好朋友，誰不該用話來俏皮誰。你這應該罰酒三杯，來！說着，把面前斟滿了、的一杯酒，高高的舉了起來。（四〇一）本刋特寫庇寒所一瞥  影呆　　是一個大冷天的午后，冷風吹到面上，好像要把肉割下來的樣子，南火車站的附近，哪條舖着單軌電車路的石子路上，立滿了蓬首垢面的男女老小，衣服不是破碎，要用麻袋來替代。因爲這馬路的旁邊是潮州會節，裏面設有庇寒所，這些人守在鐵門外面，是爲了庇寒所收容不下而被擯在門外的。　　馬路上也立滿了看聞的人，連得一個賣餛飩的也把擔子放下來停着閒看。「走吧！你不要以爲餛飩是生的，他們不會搶，早上一個賣花生米的，一個賣線粉油豆腐的，不是統被他們搶光嗎？生的餛飩他們也要搶的。」另一個看閒的人放出一種老氣橫秋的態度而說，賣餛飩的果然被他這幾句話嚇走，挑了擔子來不及的跑開。　　從這一羣飢餓朋友的裏面軋進了鐵門，在潮州會館之中，到處是收容着的苦人，流浪者，他們已收容在庇寒所裏了。面部的表情，雖然同樣是蓬首垢面，却不像問口那羣人的失望，比較是安樂，因為在這麽冷的天氣，有了吃和住，便沒有其他的問題了。　　這裏除了兩進屋子以外，前面還臨時搭成了幾間產席棚，到處已住滿了收容進來的人；的確，再不能多收容了。稻草舖成了床，他們有的在談天，有的在晒太陽，雖然成人比較多，但十三四歲的孩子也有不少。看他們的情狀，就是平常在馬路上的面求乞的人，幾個職員，都拿着竹竿在指揮，人是太多了，秩序的確不大好維持。我立了一刻，一種特殊的氣味，頓時向鼻子裏直　。　　據說這裏已有一千多人，每天要吃不少米，向來是一粥一飯，可是這年頭爲了不景氣的緣故，做好事的人也大打折扣，經費感到缺乏，所以改了三頓粥。往年這庇寒所要辦到淸明才遣散，可是而今爲了經費關係，說不定天暖些就要停辦的。等到停辦之後，這羣苦人當然又要散在街頭上面，過他們的流浪生活了。我在裏面和職員們談了一會，便走了出來，這些飢餓羣的動亂狀態，直到現在，似乎還深印在我腦幕之中。拉雜話吳門榷藝記  叔範　　書家兼小學家蕭蛻公（退圖）先生，年來躭悅禈理，謝客吳門。其及門鄧鐵，李健，王南亭輩違薰灼者，亦十閱塞暑。去秋，先生周花甲，門弟子將謀所以爲壽，先生聞之不悅，曰：吾豈夫差山下，開門成市，斤斤期酒食饌哉？若曹但思賈劉之于韓門可爾！且吾日就衰颓，念一且奄忽，藝事無傳；即今雖飫旨酒，亦何所樂？鄧鐵等知先生將耳提而面命之也，遂遄程往；，從之者，余與　蕉僧若瓢。　　先生卜居大石頭巷，蕭巷深掩，數剝啄，始親出寬扉；見余等，癯容盎然，喜色可掬。入內，秋花一徑，着老人　影，如黃葉林中，穿過野鶴。茗頃，先生喟然曰：數載不作詩，自謂已脫文字障矣，乃今秋病間，百哀復結句相犯，遣之無術，抽之益甚，垂老襟抱，何能堪此？術者謂余殘冬必不祿。其信然歟？死，吾不懼，欠與二三子一了因緣耳。鐵！爾善書善刻，付汝印，興爾字；石爲古泥所作，若亦爾師也，善藏之。健！爾愛詩，吾授爾句。凡有所疑，無乎隱，不知明年今日，老人猶在吾耶？時鄧鐵等，皆湛湛孕淚不能聲。先生鐵其意，亂之曰：老人詩境，輸與爾曹，然亦有一二堪資諷誦者乎？于是始稍讀其集。如偶書：『付與兒曹供嗤默，須知不學是英雄。』詠史：』豕立皆當王者貴，云亡其政法爲徒。』在亭林晚村之間，因知先生原有心人也。共哀黃興兒（所畜犬名）一章，結韵：『念動悲涕，爾我皆天民。』允凄厲沉鬱。齋壁則懸有六十自壽聯：『醉裏一陶然，老我相羊頻中聖儒冠徒餓死！生兒不象始稱賢。」謂爲此老恬淡，直小視之耳。　　午，應定光寺儈靜安招，往就伊蒲。先生持飮戒有年，是日，亦量尊暢飮。旣歡，專闡藝事，答對舟雙楫一始艮終乾」之說，則曰；東北屬左爲艮，喩執筆時，須自距離左肩一二寸處起，蓄力右轉；西北屬右爲乾，迨旣開展，將全力運注右臂，由肘而腕而指，以完成一筆；適成一大回環也。其解疏密之說云：六朝字，內密外疎，唐以後，內疎外密，如曰字，魏碑多作曰，唐宋多作日，此其顯例。其說鐘鼎云：亦可假定爲南北派周器，法謹而嚴，別之爲北；荆楚出土，以樸野勝，列之爲南。席間舉凡自鍾王下迄石齋鴻寳，溯源析脈，觀縷勿遺。對於近人作品，亦多所論列，于寐叟則曰：矜冶多姿，溺之亦弊。允以評康南海，最爲語妙：長素字，如洋葱炒牛肉，雖驟可口，終非正味。又曰：藝之爲道，其歸尚操，絕勿可發生對象，舍己悅人。古來卓然名家者，斷無有中雜前人五六分面貌者。又曰：治藝雖尚氣韵，要須無背于理，倉碩畫桃，有大近斗者，共題曰三千歲一實，是尚無碍。有效之者，乃竟作盈盂之枇杷，不典好奇，便成話柄。其告鄧鐵曰：吾奚能師汝，亦猶古泥作印，中年未迨汝六七也；然爾固當撇老朽而上追至人也。終席，所闡者類如此。是晚，擬赴桃花塢準提庵佾的，而先生止之曰：吾意殊未盡也。復導游張國，及戒幢寺放生池；斜日澄潭，人影疎落，惟聞語鵲梄鴉，遙相酬答，此意蕭寥，彌堪追味。旋驅飛輪，于霜柳繁燈問，尙彷彿見此老欵段以歸也。　　啟事　投稿諸君鑒：一月份春秋及兒童週刋，承惠大作，易勝感紉，稿費茲已結算淸楚，請卽具條蓋章，十六日起至廿日北，每日下午二時至四時，向本館會計處領取為菏　　白華，夭影，小俊，錢小山，方正，金年，楊作舟，王志欽，葛賢寗，逸梅，雪鴣，振華，林儷琴，汝，天厓，其中，（見童週刋）錢春綺，愚生，巴娜，張惠明，秋郎，王無懷，特，龔振民，季芝，鼓浪，糜文煥，諸君鑒，請卽補寄圖章，並親筆來信以便核對爲荷。　　申報春秋編輯部啟</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言說同類相殘  夢若　　　日本六十年來的大風雪，影響到北陸一帶的飛禽界，發生一個變異。因地面上的食物，全被白雪所蔽，致敦賀天空，有千萬鳶雀等，同類相殘，以療飢餓，爭鬥很烈，結果有無數死鳥，從空墮下。　　敦賀天空，因大風雪而演出這一塲飛禽同類相食的爭鬥，這種變異，看來似很希奇，其實却也無甚可怪。蓋千萬飛烏，迫於飢不得食的絕境，爲求本身的生存，只好互相殘殺。這便是生物界生存競爭的現象。　　不但是鳥類，就是號稱爲萬物之靈的人類，也免不了有這種行爲。芸芸衆生，無時不你爭我奪，這是爲生存而競爭。近世以來，世界紛紛攘攘，也無非是這種行爲的表現。且人類的同類相殘，也較動物界爲烈。一决戰爭，便要犧牲無量數的生靈。二十年前發生的歐洲大戰，卽是一個最明顯的例子。　　不過這里要分別淸楚，飛禽的同相類食，這種蠢動，純爲一時的飢餓所激起，並不含有什麼惡意，旣算不得是殘忍，更談不到道德。若人類的爭鬥，意義就完全兩樣。像列强的互相殘殺，它們並不眞實不能維持生存，才迫而出此。它們都是抱有不正當的野心，要藉競爭來滿足各人的慾望。且人類是有智慧的，又具有一種道德意識，曉得戰爭是殘忍，是無人道。但當其從事於相爭相奪，便就顧不了一切，彼此拚一個你死我活。這便是世界所以不能和平，時常要掀起風波的原因。　　說到强者的征服弱者，這簡直不是同類相殘，只好說是弱肉强食。因相殘是對等的，不但你殺我，我也殺你。例如敦賀天空飛鳥的爭鬥，定是互相啄食，鳶要食雀，雀也要食鳶。若人類中强者的逞蠻，其兇暴之狀，眞如獅子撲羊，一口吞下去。這才是野蠻之至。不過它們的侵略，不但不承認為野蠻，還要藉一些動聽的名目，來掩蔽其醜惡。現在歐洲就有一個强國，正在東菲宣揚文化。東亞方面，也有一個友邦，正在我國實行親善提携。這便是人類巧詐異於動物的地方。　　生存競爭的結果，是適者生存，不適者淘汰。目前是一個生存競爭很劇烈的時候，一班弱小民族，若不急起奮鬥，以與强者爭勝負，則滅亡實可立而待。野孩子們  小綺　　　隨着天慕越低暗下來，雨也越落越起勁，兩旁街店的屋簷下都站滿了躱閃的人們，偌大的一條路只讓給雜亂的車蓬來往奔竄着。汽車尖利的喇叭音在雨聲中呌嘈。爲了淋不停的昏雨，未到傍晚，天很快便黑透了。人們看看雨一下子並不會收歇，都冒雨散去，趕回溫暖的家室。現在祇賸下赤着足，穿着用舊蔴袋綴成的襤褸破衣衫的幾個小伙子，噓着氣，瑟縮地圍攏在一塊。有的半坐着，抹着鼻涕，有的站到簷溜下邊，伸着脚，踏窟窿里的污水。都那麼悠閒似的。　　—媽媽的，天要塌了不成，雨這樣拚命倒着。　　雖然是帶着幾乎相同於咒怨的口氣，但對於雨，他們這批小伙子是並不感到厭惡，反而會激起一陣興奮與一種意外的收獲浮上幼小的心頭。於是他們的眼睛不禁充滿了强烈的慾望的光芒，耽耽地注視着自前面而來的黃包車子。這里是十字路頭的交點，而一直打前邊突起來的是一座士敏士的造橋，橋的體積是很高的，這一邊望，不見另一邊稍遠些的五層樓洋房的屋尖，人力車子過橋的時候着實吃力，若有一半個人帮帮拉，或推一推，是省力得多。這批小伙子就是幹的那樣一套活兒。常他們認定</p>

<p>一輛一輛的車子是要過橋去的，便搶先跑到橋邊守候着，車子來到跟前的時兒，卽一攢勁以隻手把住一旁的車桿，彎下腰，糾糾地冲上去，等到過了橋　才放手。　　於是會從坐在車上的人掉下個銅子，算是出了幾秒鐘氣力的報酬。可是每一决不一定都這樣，每個坐車的人未必都不呌人不失望。有時候車子是過了橋　了，伸着手預備接銅子，也許不是人吝嗇個半個銅板，而是懶得往衣袋里掏，或者適巧身上沒銅子，這批「短工」的小勞働者就祗好眼巴巴瞧着一刹那飛亦似的滾下去的車子的背影，嘆一口氣，裝個鬼臉。更許會對於那車上的人加以一塲毒駡，以爲他們惋惜一個銅子。一面又急忙忙逃到橋邊不大爲人看得見的地方，因爲紅頭阿三那沉重的釘鐵的馬蹄似的皮鞋聲已經噠噠的從後頭擦嚮着，經騐告訴他們，要是遲疑一下，便有得耳括子和皮鞋尖踢屁股的賞賜的。而牠們是有的兎子樣敏捷的腿子，狼樣機智的眼睛，阿三大搖大擺走上來的時候，連鬼影子都不見了。　　他們說不定還藏在遠處暗笑阿三是大傻瓜。到了落着太猖獗的雨，阿三顯然是不願意淋濕自己的衣服去跟這些小伙子纏鬧的。於是他們可以暫時放放心，擺出一付安定的神色。幹他們的。　　在晴天，除了在深夜，他們却不大獃在這里的。儘有雙粗健腿，一股蠻勁，也儘有給他們溜躂的塲所。大地是他們的母親，隨處可以躺下去，夏天有拂着海風的碼頭，冬日有街店的門檻………都是溫柔而現成的家。一夥子怪輕鬆的，只有一隻生銹的銅盂，隨身帶着，此外沒別的，也同時沒有人世間的憂愁，掛慮，悲哀。雖則都小小的個子，輕的年紀，可是却有了不小的胆量，勇敢，和各樣複雜的經騐。而他們畢竟是從阿三的毛拳頭，木棍子，皮鞭底敎訓底下長成起來的，他們小個兒，便養成了不怕一切的硬性子。　　有一天，給我看到一輛有鐵絲窗子的黑色囚車停在一個弄堂門口，巡捕在弄堂內抓出一大批隱匿的小伙子來，裝進車上。他們全說：　　——我沒犯法，爲什麽要到行里去。　　——不准開口。　　（他們都似乎不顧意離開這個好歹還是自由的世界。）　　能够抓得乾凈麼？在一路上我是不由地這樣懷疑着。山野的呼号  沈塢　　　畢竟是春天了，過了舊曆的新年，天氣就漸漸有點溫暖起來，山野間的積雪也慢慢的在陽光下融解了，凝結着泳塊的小溪這時又淙淙地湧泡着；太陽光在山背里映着銀白的雪景，點綴着一簇靑蒼的松林，格外顯得美麗。浴着在陽光之下底山野間的寥落的村莊，似乎也漸漸顯得有點活潑的景象，田野間的行人，忙忙碌碌的帶來了着耕的消息。…　　淸晨，我們在田畦道上散着步，舒舒幾乎困了一個月來的鬱悶。老宋好象顯得十分熟練的樣子，走在前頭，我跟踪着他的尾后；沒有風，一片廣延無邊的天野陷在靜默的空氣里。我們慢慢的繞着曲折的小徑，走上了半山來。在一株高大的古松下，我們坐下了。　　老宋往身上搜索着一些什麽，一面朝着我們笑：「小莊，你們身邊帶了銅鈿沒有？」接着就拍的一聲，從身上丟了一副紙牌出來。他慢慢地把一張舊油布攤在地上，上面覆蓋了一張舊新聞紙。大家好象都沒有意料到老宋拉我們出來作這一手玩意，用着一種驚詫的眼色朝他望着，然後又潛意識地人身上把銅板搜了出來。於是，幾個人就圍了攏來，把身體互相倚偎着。　　太陽從樹叢中透射着一度白光進來，不時有些松子和松針落在我們的頭上，落在我們的肩背上，有時也會從頒子里落到頸項中去，弄得皮膚有點發癢；然而太家都聚精會神，集中在賭博上，於是就沒人理會到它了。老宋一面賭一面吹着口哨，助長着這時賭博者之間底緊張的情赭。……大家好象忘記了這幾乎一個月來的抑鬱，也忘記這一年來的艱苦和危難，當這一瞬之問，神經隨着興奮的情緒之起伏，漸漸有點兒痳痺了　　偶爾有一陣帶着溫意的和風從山野間吹來，紙牌和舊新聞紙都被吹動了，老宋立刻就丟下了手上的牌子，用石子把舊新闻紙壓住，口里咭哩咕囉的駡着，這樣地给山風搗鬼着已經不止一次了。弄得大家帶着又氣又焦急的心情，若斷若續，而又不安寗地賭博下去。…　　漸漸地我們又賭非常哄熱了。老宋用着猴子似的眼睛瞧我們望，象隱着什麼了不得的秘密似的，把最后一張牌子死命地按在油布上，提防着別人從旁洩了光…。　　正在這哄熱的空氣之問，突然却來了一聲緊急的呼號。這呼號立刻捉住了每一個人的心，大家丟了手上的牌子，謊張地朝四週張望。小狗子立刻就往山脚下面走去，大家也無意識地跟着走。　　呼號的聲音延續地拖長下去，象是人聲，也象是野獸的呼號。…終於，我們在山麓間發現了這呼聲的來源了。—那是一個深坑，里面正掉着一個女人，她的下體是光裏着。一大堆汚泥和石子壓在她的半身上，在泥土之間滲着，流着一些鮮紅的血。…地面周圍有一些糢糊的脚印。　　我們把這女人從泥士中救了出來，一把染着血漬的刀也泥土中發現了。在山野里，地拼命地呼喊着，好象要喊震了整个山谷似的。我們把油布遮着她的下體，慢慢以抬到村邊的亭子里來。　　她已經不能說話了。光是喊，聲音也就漸漸微弱下去。終於漸漸在血的滾流中，拼出了她最后的呼喊，全身的脈膊也就靜止了，呌聲也靜止了。山野間依舊岑寂着。　　我們正打算往鄉公所去請鄉長出來騐屍，和報告这件慘案，那知村間早已流傳着殺淫婦底閒言了。這好象是公開的秘密似的，兇手也就依然優遊地給他逃逸了去。鄉公所騐過了屍，把她收殮了。不知是誰在人叢中埋怨着我們的多事，說是不該使這個爛女人也有棺木過殮的。—然而我們始終緘默着，呆望若這山野的雪景。女神  江　作　　正在顓頊歡呼的當兒，忽然雷火四起，山體破裂，飛沙走石，天地震搖，顓頻之徒先後倒死於山麓。（二十一）法律與大蟲  蕭雯　　　孔丘懷着周遊天下的雄望，帶着一羣子弟，自己坐在車子裏，走着無盡的路。那一天到了齊國境界，靠着巍峨的泰山脚轆轆地走。　　荒野的風吹來，他吸了一口鮮氣，隱隱地有一個娘見們噎格的哭聲，統探出頭，靠着車子的橫木，拉長了耳朶，過一會說：　　「這是含着多麼憂傷氣味的哀哭喲」！　　回頭看見後面站若氣昻昂的子路。　　「呵仲喲！前面去問問那家娘哭，得如此傷心」？　　「是啦：先生」。子路老是那樣粗聲氣地。　　子路找了一會，在亂石堆的莽草裏，看到了墳頭，也看到那娘兒：一臉淚水，』一臉憂傷，伏在墳頭噎格噎格的哭。子路少見女人的哭，也呆住了，想到自己的目的，前上一步問道：　　「娘子！借一句話，為什麽好端端哭得傷心喲」？　　那女人們也少見生客，有點膽小不好意思，看子路的神氣却像個讀書人，便整一整衣角，隨手拉出一條手帕，擦乾了眼淚。當一個人傷心的時候得到同情，像見了親人，便格格的回答。　　「先生：你是外鄉人吧，也不瞞你說，這地近山有大蟲；我公公便是被大蟲吞掉的，我丈夫也被大蟲害的，現在我的見子又給大蟲啣去了。我好命苦的人喲！」話還不曾說完，鼻涕，眼淚已掛在鼻樑上。　　「那末爲什麽你們不搬家呢」？子路的急性子跳着脚，心裏橫着疑問。　　「先生！祇是這裏的法律好喲」；那女人還是哭。　　子路心裏想「大蟲」，「法律」，娘兒們面前也不敢放蠻，說一聲：　　「娘子，多謝，讓我回報先生去」。子路趕上路去追着了孔丘一羣人。一五一十把娘兒的話告訴了他們。　　孔丘在車上立了起來，眼睛呆住的。　　「小子們聽着：有時候刻毒的法律比大蟲更厲害的喲！」　　弟子們每個人心裏轉着先生的話。　　孔丘周遊天下的雙輪車轆轆地在風塵裏走遠了。　　——仿「禮記檀弓」與「孔子家語」意啟事　　江敉君因偶患微恙，以致「女神」停利多日，有勞讀者函電垂詢，現續稿已送來，從今日起仍間日刋登，請讀者注意。　　增刋編輯室啟播音誘惑劇人播音會無綫電劇本（五）  劉亞偉編劇　　大哥：他們如果不負責任，我們應每個人負點責任，難道只有等死了嗎？我們邊境上的堤岸—我們應該大家注意呀！　　小魯：好！我們自己動手哇！這是我們自己的事呀！是不是，老五？　　老五：是啊！大哥：你是邨長，你得提倡提倡，別人拿我們開玩笑，難道說是還尋自己的開心嗎？　　大哥：當然！我們集合起來。自己用自己的力氣，來救自己，天快黑了，阿巧，把東西收拾進去，我們到里頭去坐坐吧！（他答應了一句）　　小魯：大哥，我們應該派一個人到縣的邊境上去打聽消息呀，風聲不好的話，我們可以就動手了！　　老五：我去，我走！　　大哥：你回來，我早派老張去了，他叫完了你們吃飯就動身了！　　小魯：有多少里路哇？　　大哥：不到十里。　　阿巧：這麼近呢？我收拾東西去了，風聲不好的話好逃走哇！　　小魯：什麽逃走？你能够逃走，別人也能够逃走嗎？人家的八十歲老娘也能够和你十幾歲的小娘兒們一樣跑得快嗎？　　老五：阿巧，別多說話了，我們是靑年，應該除去了自己給自己使用的能力以外，還應該帮助別人的！允其是不如我們的人。　　小魯：你已經把你所以愛我這個窮小子的勇氣都消滅了嗎？　　阿巧：（不高興的）那里，要是消滅了的話，我早就想回娘家了！　　大哥：不要吵了，大家的事還沒幹成呢，又告個人爭鬥起來了！老五，你也可以回家去看看了，你能動手，別人也許不能的，你快點回去看看安置安置呀！聽鑼一響馬上就到土地廟前頭會齊。　　老五：好了，我先去一趟！（走門，風聲大作）　　阿巧：已經颶風了，（害怕）　　大哥：小魯，把衣裳多帶兩件，鋤頭預備在手底下，（小魯應聲，鐵聲，）阿巧，我們走了之後，你帶兩個包先到老五的家裏去等我們！聽見了沒有，（阿巧應聲）（風聲很大，遠處有女人小孩啼聲）特別節目　　歐亞航空公司播音　　大東（五八〇）下午八時三十五分夜　（期陶婁土作曲）安眠歌　（斯陶婁士作曲）頭上黑髮　（期陶婁士作曲）歌唱　　　　明梅團　　華美（一〇六〇）下午五時一刻至六時紙窗夜雨　（雨焚）靑春姑娘　（純美）新小放牛　（張素貞）良辰美景　（雨焚）告別南洋　（純美）從軍別愛　（張素貞）　　玫瑰團　　東方（一○二〇）下午六時十分至七時龍翔鳳舞　（前奏）嫁給勇士　（曼傑）楊柳絲絲　（玲玲）人間仙子　（曼傑）一封快信　(曼麗）鐮刀舞歌　（全體）戀愛明星　（玲玲）銀漢雙星　（傑麗）　　上海歌劇社　　華與（一二六〇）下午七時至七時三刻秋風落葉　（徐健）別　巴黎　（姚敏）漁光曲　（周　）小鸚歌　（徐健）滿江紅　（姚敏）春宵曲　（周璇）牆裹牆外（周璇）（徐健）　　大上海社　　華美（一〇六〇）下午九時至十時燕燕歌　（飛亞）嫁給勇士吧　（飛虹）薔薇花底　（文仙）告別南洋　（飛亞）鴛鴦怨　（飛虹）丁香山　（文仙）月下女郞　（飛亞）休息五分鐘　（飛虹）彈詞　　　　徐文壁開篇　　市音（一三四〇）上午十時至十一時　　「開篇」何麗娜自嘆　　多情却是總痴情。情到深時恨亦深。名勝幽雅環翠園。麗娜獨居嘆聲頻。一縷情絲繫伊人。玉容慘淡愁默默。梨花經雨不勝春。心切切。意况沉。終朝含愁把翠眉顰。自思量本是聰明女。到如今。反被聰明誤此生。想舞塲初見樊家子。一點芳心便默然驚。陶家屢次來相遇。得知他。書香門第大學生。倜儻風流貌超羣。數月相識成密友。家樹是至誠老實少年人。老父堂上亦讚聲聲。轉託伯和爲媒灼。鴛鴦譜上早留名。此段姻緣穩穩成。那日邂逅衷談曲。樊郞一席話兒說分明。方知李代桃僵別有人。欲要揮慧劍斬恩情。怎奈一憶伊人一斷魂。諒月老未把紅絲繫。三生石上未種因。吾只得。拋却紅塵殘生隱。黃卷靑燈了此生。此生未卜他生。　　程方舟李速蓀毛家書　　華美（一〇六〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「瞎夫妻」　　瞎新郞與瞎新娘。交拜成雙入洞房。紅綠綢牽遵古禮。坐牀撤帳作鴛鴦。一個兒是。雖然有目如無目。看不出新娘短與長。一個兒是。有眼無珠全不見。只知道。身旁坐的是新郞。兩人一對天緣凑。賽過。盲目魚兒作並行。待到在深人靜後。大家暗暗脫衣裳。上牀須照周公禮。就是。</p>

If the country's actions are forced upon it by others and do not seek resistance, then the spirit of establishing the country will be lost. Even if great benefits are gained, what is the use? In the past, someone said that a commoner cannot be deprived of his ambition, and a scholar also has ambition, and a country also has ambition." Today, our country's ambition is as indicated by the Premier's will, to seek China's freedom and equality. As such, we must seek the thorough completion of the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood internally, and seek the realization of the Principle of Nationalism externally. Today, our country's international position is extremely difficult. To save the nation and seek survival, the Chinese nation should rise up in unison and must not be complacent for a moment. To achieve this important goal, we must first understand the situation of various European and American countries, as well as the status of neighboring countries. If our country wants to protect the country from danger, we must not be afraid of the strong and make the greatest determination, as the resolution states: , Thoroughly seek political reform, awaken the spirit of the entire nation, and unite together to struggle; , Thoroughly review the trend of diplomacy and determine the direction so that friendly countries can provide powerful public opinion; , Thoroughly revitalize national strength as the foundation for saving the nation. Now that the central government has studied this, the people of our country have always been known for their patriotism, and our party was originally revolutionary. It was like this in the past, so how can it be any different now? I think that although China is in danger now, if we can follow this to seek, then developing the people's wisdom and restoring national rights may not be unexpected. It is incumbent upon the comrades of this party to not be opportunistic in the face of adversity, to restore the revolutionary spirit, and for the compatriots of the country to not lose the normal state of being masters."

<p>Nanjing: The National Government held a memorial week at 10 a.m. on the 10th, attended by Zhang Ji, Jing Hengyi, Deng Jiayan, Wang Boqun, Chen Shaokuan, Cheng Qian, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials of the National Government's various departments and councils, totaling more than 500 people. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he delivered an on-the-spot report entitled "Elucidation of the Meaning of People's Livelihood," and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Lin reported on the elucidation of the meaning of people's livelihood at the memorial week of the National Government on the morning of the 10th, first stating that there is a saying in the Premier's Outline of National Reconstruction, "The first priority of construction lies in people's livelihood," which shows that the construction of people's livelihood is the premise of all national construction. The meaning of the two words "people's livelihood" is, as the Premier's last words say, that people's livelihood is the life of the people, the survival of society, the livelihood of the nation, and the life of the masses. Based on the Premier's definition, the meaning of the two words "people's livelihood" is explained in great detail, stating that from the individual's standpoint, it is the life of the people; from the society's standpoint, it is the survival of society; from the nation's standpoint, it is the livelihood of the nation; and from the perspective of the entire body, it is the life of the masses. Furthermore, it is determined that the Premier said, "People's livelihood is the center of historical evolution." Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, social chaos has always occurred because people's livelihood has been obstructed, or because the lives of the people and the livelihoods of the nation have been threatened, or because the survival of society and the lives of the masses have lost their guarantee. When a nation is oppressed by foreign races and cannot maintain its survival, the problem of people's livelihood is manifested as a national problem. In a country where the majority of the people are politically oppressed, causing panic in their lives, the problem of people's livelihood is manifested as a political problem. When the domestic economy is monopolized by a small number of people, so that the majority of people cannot maintain their survival, the problem of people's livelihood is manifested as an economic problem. It can be seen that although there are many problems throughout history, the essence is only one: people's livelihood. The Premier said, "People's livelihood is the center of social evolution, and social evolution is the center of history. The conclusion is that the center of history is people's livelihood, not material things." Since people's livelihood is the center of social evolution, and the problem of people's livelihood is the driving force of social evolution, the only fundamental function of the Three Principles of the People is to solve the problem of people's livelihood, eliminate the obstacles to people's livelihood, guarantee the safety of people's livelihood, enrich the content of people's livelihood, and promote the upward trend of people's livelihood. This is the only fundamental function of the Three Principles of the People. This is why the Principle of People's Livelihood is the center of the Three Principles of the People. Finally, he stated, "I hope that everyone will take the promotion of the Three Principles of the People as their duty, and conduct constant research and make continuous efforts, so that social stability of people's livelihood can be achieved, and the country can naturally rise to the realm of stability, strength, and prosperity."

<h3>Southwest Executive Department Routine Meeting Discusses Reorganizing Party Affairs</h3>

<h3>Chiang, Director-General, Issues Order to Strictly Handle Registration of Opium Smokers; Those Who Are Negligent or Omit Information Will Be Disciplined Accordingly</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Director-General Chiang issued a special telegram to the provincial and municipal governments on the 10th, instructing them to conscientiously handle the registration of opium smokers. Those who are negligent or omit information will be held accountable for dereliction of duty and disciplined accordingly. The original telegram stated: "To investigate the registration of opium smokers in various provinces and cities, the original deadline was the end of the 24th year [1935]. Orders have been repeatedly issued to comply with this and to submit a list of the total number of registrations. Subsequently, provinces such as Ningxia, Sichuan, and Hunan submitted reports stating that due to the activities of the communists, the situation was special and could not be completed as scheduled. It was proposed to extend the deadline. As the laws and regulations on opium prohibition are clearly defined, and the original intention was to implement the six-year eradication plan, it is not appropriate to change it suddenly due to the special circumstances of a small number of provinces. However, after investigating the registration process in various provinces, Jiangsu has achieved better results. Although the total number of opium smokers registered in Jiangsu is nearly 200,000, the accuracy remains to be checked. The number of opium smokers registered in other provinces and cities is very small, and omissions are feared to be even more difficult to avoid. In the future, the quantity of opium produced in the border provinces should be determined based on this national standard for the total number of registered opium smokers. If the number of registrations reported by various provinces and cities does not match the actual number, the entire opium prohibition plan will be affected. In order to ensure the universality and accuracy of registration, this director-general convened the first regular meeting of the Anti-Opium Committee to discuss concrete plans and formulated fourteen articles on methods for reporting opium smokers for implementation. All should comply with this and conscientiously handle the matter. There must be no more excuses for extending the deadline. If there are still any negligences or omissions after this report, it will be held accountable for dereliction of duty and disciplined accordingly. In addition to appointing commissioners to handle the matter together with the provincial and municipal governments and issuing separate orders on the reporting of opium smokers registration methods, it is necessary to first telegraph to comply with this and vigorously urge supplementary registration." (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

(10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: More than 60,000 opium smokers have registered themselves for rehabilitation in the province, with Jiangdu, Changshu, Songjiang, and Datong having the most. Since the deadline is approaching, the Department of Civil Affairs has ordered all counties to intensify their work and strictly enforce the regulations for wealthy households and gentry, and not allow them to evade them.

<h3>After the Ice Melts Outside Dagukou, a Sudden Easterly Wind Causes Freezing Again: Ships Are Still Blocked at Sea, and a Cold Wave Also Enters Tanggu</h3>
<p>Tianjin: An easterly wind suddenly rose on the evening of the 10th, and the ice outside Dagukou froze again. The ships that have not entered the port are still blocked at sea, and a cold wave has also entered Tanggu. If the wind does not change on the 11th, the port will remain blocked. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The weather was warmer on the 10th, and the ice in the section of the Haihe River between Tanggu and Tianjin completely melted. The ice outside Dagukou also melted for the most part. The ships that ran into trouble between Heigukou successively escaped their predicament and entered the port. The sea route between Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Dalian has been cut off for two weeks, and foreign wheat has not arrived, causing the price of flour in Tianjin to soar. Imported goods have also increased significantly in price. Today, because the sea route has been opened, the special price has dropped slightly. The icebreaker of the Haihe Engineering Bureau and the Tianjin Customs Port Affairs Office departed from Xidagu and headed overseas to break the ice, so that the sea route would be opened without obstruction. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The severe ice blockage outside Tanggu Port, which was a fatal blow to Tianjin Port, began to melt as the weather gradually warmed up since the beginning of spring. According to an aerial survey on the 9th, most of the ice floes were gradually moving towards each other. The ships that were stranded outside the port were fighting against the ice floes and beginning to navigate. Therefore, the shipping companies began to smile again, and Tianjin Port showed vitality again. The Dalian Steamboat Company's Tianjin Maru, departing from Dalian on the 11th, was the first to revive the regular Dalian-Tianjin route. Other routes can be restored to their original state within two or three days. (10th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

You embraced the Three Principles of the People, which were deeply ingrained in you. You traveled to the border areas and assisted the central government, sharing the dangers and difficulties, and you made great contributions. You were diligent and dedicated, and your virtues were widely promoted. You were the protector of the country, pacifying and harmonizing the territories. You were as reliable as the mountains and rivers. Why did the flock of flies attack you with their poisonous stingers? You had a different heart and could bear to betray your ruler. Alas, it has always been a sorrow that virtuous and good people are ill-fated. Especially in the case of comrades, you had a close relationship since the past. Why were you not mourned, and why did you lose our talent? Looking from afar, we gather the souls. May you return, and may you enjoy this sacrifice." (10th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Observations on the Japanese General Election</h3>
<p>Since the dissolution of the Japanese Diet, the entire nation has focused its attention on the general election. The voting date is set for the 20th of this month. In recent days, the government and various political parties have been actively engaged in propaganda and advocacy. Japan has had an electoral system for over forty years, during which time there have been eighteen Diet re-elections. However, none have been as significant or unique as this one. Since the Manchurian Incident, the military has held power, and the position of political parties has steadily declined. Constitutional politics exists in name only. This election is to gauge the attitude of the Japanese people towards military rule, their feelings towards political parties, and their choice between democracy and fascism. If the government wins, not only will domestic fascism intensify, but foreign aggression and isolationism will become unstoppable. The military's arrogance will increase, and the world's war will become more imminent. Not only will the fate of Japan be decided, but China and the world will face an unprecedentedly grave test.</p>
<p>The slogans of the Okada Cabinet to appeal to the masses are "National Unity" and "Clean Elections." The Japanese election situation is extremely corrupt. In each election, political parties use money to buy votes, offering ten cents or half a yen per vote. The Japanese people are not interested in the democratic system and are often unwilling to participate without financial incentives. The Okada Cabinet aims to eradicate this deep-rooted problem. The enthusiasm of its campaign is unprecedented in Japanese constitutional history. It is said that slogans to eliminate election corruption were written on kites and flown by children. Furthermore, the Okada Cabinet proclaims itself as a cabinet that transcends political parties to address the national crisis. Therefore, "National Unity" is also the central theme of the government's propaganda. They exaggerate the "1936 Crisis" to instill fear in the people and make them continue to obey the leadership of the military and become the backers of aggression. As for the Minseitō party, which is attached to the military government, it recently announced ten major platforms advocating for reforming political parties, building an economic national defense, seeking international cooperation and coexistence, avoiding arms races, revising tariffs, and relieving rural areas. Its slogans are "National Interests First, Party Interests Second" and "Seek National Unity and Oppose One-Party Control." These proposals are touching, but they are empty and merely serve as decoration for military rule.</p>
<p>In this election, the contestants include the Minseitō, Seiyūkai, Kokumin Dōmei, and Shōwa parties. The Seiyūkai is in an anti-government position. Its主張 is to abolish the disguised all-party cabinet and eliminate fascist tendencies, replacing false unity with real unity, bureaucratic politics with party politics, instability with stability, and policies that promote national defense and industry simultaneously instead of prioritizing national defense at the expense of industry. The Kokumin Dōmei takes a wait-and-see attitude, wavering between the two major parties, seeking to profit from their conflict. The Shōwa party is composed of Seiyūkai members who joined the Okada Cabinet. Its support for the Okada Cabinet is no less than that of the Minseitō, with Finance Minister Takahashi's financial policies as its banner. According to observers familiar with Japanese domestic politics, the Seiyūkai may win 210 seats in the Lower House in this election, the Minseitō may win 200 seats, the Shōwa party may win over 20 seats, and the Kokumin Dōmei also claims that the government, backed by the Minseitō and Shōwa parties, can still maintain a majority in the Diet. However, the margin is limited, and the foundation is not solid. It is said that after the general election, the Okada Cabinet will resign, and the Emperor will appoint a new all-party cabinet, with each party participating in governance according to its proportion of seats in the Diet.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has been in a state of national frenzy. Internally, assassinations occur one after another, and externally, it engages in reckless aggression and arrogance. The withdrawal from the League of Nations, the withdrawal from the naval treaties, the seizure of Manchuria, and the division of North China and Inner Mongolia are all examples of its frenzied actions. If this continues, it will inevitably plunge the world's 1.6 billion people into war. The great catastrophe of civilization is not limited to the Far East. International pacifists deeply hope that the Japanese people will realize the dangers of military rule. The result of a mad policy will inevitably be self-destruction. They should awaken, end abnormal politics, restore a sober political state and a normal social order. The general election on February 20th is the best opportunity to express this public opinion. Although the Japanese people lack training in democracy, their political interest is not strong, and familial relations have a strong influence. It is difficult for this election to not boost the morale of the military faction. It is feared that it is impossible in practice for it to promote democracy and restrain the military.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Bandit Liu Guitang Flee North Along the Jinpu Railway; Various Armies Closely Pursue in Separate Directions; Liu Disguised Himself and Fled Towards Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Over a hundred remnants of Liu Guitang's bandit gang fled north along the Jinpu Railway. They fled from Guangzong to the vicinity of Kaihe Ganlang Village in Nangong, looting along the way, abducting men and women as hostages, tying them behind horses, and letting the horses gallop and drag them, which was cruel and inhumane. The 63rd Army's armored vehicles rushed to Dayingzhen West to pursue them. On the morning of the 9th, the bandits fled to Yao Village, passing through Caizhou, intending to harass Wuyi. The cavalry of the 32nd Army stationed in Shenxian received the report and intercepted them. The bandits had a tendency to flee back south. The Hebei Provincial Government dispatched the 217th Regiment of Feng Zhian's division to Daming Nangong on the 9th to assist in the search, and ordered the militia of Nangong, Jixian, Wuyi, and Wuqiang counties to mobilize together to intercept them. Another small group of Liu's bandits fled to Wang Huaizhuang in Jingxian on the 9th.

In the Sangyuan area, several dozen more bandits were killed. According to the captured prisoners, Liu Guitang's bandits knew they were in dire straits due to the army's pursuit, so they abandoned their horses, disguised themselves, and fled towards Tianjin. The 32nd Army has now contacted the Shandong Army to jointly encircle and suppress them. The bandit troops appear to be fleeing towards the war zone. The Shandong Army is currently in a fierce battle with over twenty remnants of the bandits in Sangyuan. The 32nd Army has notified Chairmen Song and Han to arrest Liu Guitang. The bandit disaster will soon be quelled. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<h3>British Government Drafts a Three-Year National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Requiring an Expenditure of 300 Million Pounds to Prepare for the Ambitions of Japan and Germany</p>
<p>London, Today it was learned that the government is drafting a three-year plan to revitalize the military, requiring an expenditure of 300 million pounds. National defense bonds will soon be issued to raise these military funds. The motivation behind this plan has not yet been disclosed in detail. It is hoped that it will be fully explained when the next parliament convenes. It is said that the government believes that the empire is at risk of being attacked by ambitious countries, so it has decided to take preventive measures. According to reliable sources, the government wants to obtain a strong voice and therefore wants to quickly cooperate with countries that trust in collective security. The biggest problem for Britain at present is to explore Germany's future policies, especially to understand Germany's Eastern European policy. Some predict that Germany will cooperate with Poland to attack and occupy Ukraine. In addition, the British government is particularly concerned about the situation in the Far East and Japan's cunning schemes, because Japanese soldiers have repeatedly advocated that Britain is an old empire and can no longer protect Hong Kong and Singapore.

<h3>Soviet Minister of Transport Inspects Far Eastern Defenses</h3>
<p>Inspiring the People to Defend the Homeland with All Their Might; The Siberian Railway Becomes Militarized</p>
<p>Boli, Kaganovich, the People's Commissar of Transport of the Soviet Union, recently inspected the Far East under secret orders from the Moscow government. After passing through Vladivostok and Borosilaf, and visiting important naval and military bases, he arrived in Boli on the 8th.

<h3>Foreign Minister Hirota Eagerly Seeks to Adjust Relations with Russia</h3>
<p>Negotiations to Begin Soon to Prevent the Situation from Deteriorating</p>
<p>Tokyo, Based on the resolutions of the trilateral meeting of the Foreign Ministry, Army and Navy on the 6th and 7th, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the deterioration of relations between Japan and Russia is a fundamental obstacle to Japan's Far Eastern policy. He is determined to adjust the border area between Japan and Manchukuo to prevent the situation from deteriorating to the last step. Starting with the issue of demarcating the border, he will gradually enter the solution of pending issues between Japan and Russia in order to resolve the situation. It is scheduled to invite the Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the next few days to begin negotiations on adjusting the border. The Foreign Minister will present demands when he meets with the Russian ambassador in order to prompt the Russian government to reflect.</p>
<p>He will personally deliver the Japanese government's formal reply to the Soviet government's protest regarding the Jinchan Gou incident, denying that Japanese and Manchukuo troops crossed the border to build fortifications. Based on the on-site investigation report, he will notify that the cause of the incident lies in the illegal behavior of the Russian side, and call the Russian side's attention. The cause of the recent Jinchan Gou incident and many other border incidents is mostly the unclear border line. The actions of Japanese and Russian people on this unclear border line immediately provoke clashes between the border guards of the two countries, which increases concerns about the future of Japan-Russia relations. The Soviet government should consider the Japanese government's proposal to establish a committee to demarcate the Russian-Manchukuo border as soon as possible, and express its opposition or agreement. Negotiations on the revision of the fisheries treaty, an important pending issue between Japan and Russia, have been underway in Moscow since June last year. However, the Russian side has not shown a sincere attitude towards the Japanese proposal. This issue is a major issue for the Japanese people, and it is hoped that the Russian side will actively show sincerity and promote negotiations. (Alliance Telegram of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Radek Comments: Japan Intentionally Provoking</h3>
<p>Moscow, The well-known Soviet political commentator Radek wrote an article in the Izvestia newspaper, saying, "Only the Japanese warlords want to see conflicts on the Soviet border. They not only want to create conflicts, so that the Japanese people do not pay attention to the Manchurian incident, but also want to fully launch anti-Soviet agitation. General Nan, the commander of the Kwantung Army, no longer denies the attack on Soviet territory, and he even uses the British troops' entry into Canada during the Canadian rebellion in 1838 as an example to prove that his actions are legal." Radek detailed the facts of 1838, pointing out that the events of 1837 to 1838 and the events of 1936 are completely different. "There is no organization of expeditions to invade Manchuria within Soviet territory. On the contrary, we must assemble the national army on the Manchurian border to prevent Japanese tourists from dragging their machine guns to tour the Soviet Union. In the past, every time the Manchurian army crossed the border, they were disarmed in accordance with international law. The facts of a hundred years ago can never be a precedent for today's actions of invading other people's territory, because international law absolutely does not allow foreign troops to pursue a certain party or invade the territory of another peaceful country. Since international law does not stipulate the right of foreign troops to invade the territory of other countries, armed border crossings are a violation of international law, and in the current situation, it is undoubtedly an attack on the territory of other countries."</p>
<p>Radek pointed out that the Manchurian army invaded the Soviet border at 9:00 a.m. on January 29, and the conflict occurred thirty hours after the Manchurian army marched directly towards Voroshilovgrad. "From this point of view, the so-called pursuit of the Manchurian army within Soviet territory is completely unfounded, so there is no similarity with the events of 1837. General Nan has admitted to invading the Soviet border, and world public opinion has a clear answer to who is undermining peace in the Far East and who is stirring up trouble."

<p>Paris, The United Republican Socialist Party recently held a conference in Bécier.

<h3>The Collective Security System is Severely Criticized by the Germans</h3>
<p>What is its True Value? It Can Even Lead to Anxiety</p>
<p>Berlin, Recently, diplomatic authorities of various countries have repeatedly held talks in London and Paris, and the theory of collective security has become increasingly popular. Generally, it advocates the conclusion of various mutual assistance treaties to form a collective security system. The German political circles are now criticizing this plan, believing that Britain has always been known for being well-rounded, but now it is showing its sharp edge, which is enough to cause criticism. As for the fact that the countries are now trying their best to make the number of mutual assistance treaties increase, this is also the target of criticism here, believing that such collusion is only enough to arouse a sense of unease in Europe, which will make the general public mistakenly believe that danger is imminent and the world is threatened. A semi-official spokesperson recently made a statement, saying, "What is the true value of this kind of treaty? Once something happens, what opportunity will the League of Nations have to take action based on each of these treaties? This should be studied and estimated by other countries, and it is not for our Germany to do it for them. Therefore, countries that sincerely want to protect themselves and be safe should not always boast about the value of these treaties." (Havas Telegram of the 9th)</p>

<h3>Cabinet Expected to Reorganize After Japanese General Election</h3>
<p>Rumors of Hirota's Resignation are Inaccurate</p>
<p>The political situation after the general election is that the Seiyukai will be the largest party in the parliament, which is generally certain. However, because the Minseito and Showakai, which are in opposition to the party, have taken away a considerable number of seats, it is difficult to obtain an absolute majority. It is expected that the government will use the joint forces of the Minseito and Showakai to pressure the Seiyukai and seek a majority in the parliament. The Minseito has long been clamoring for this, and some advocate the realization of a powerful, unified cabinet centered on the political-civilian alliance or the two major parties of the political-civilian parties. The first advocate is the new Minister of Education Kawasaki. On the other hand, Minister of Railways Uchida advocates maintaining the status quo, and the current cabinet is supported by the Minseito and Showa factions. Therefore, regarding the future of the current cabinet, the opinions of Minister Kawasaki and Minister Uchida have diverged. However, Minister Kawasaki, who has the Minseito as his background, has a strong argument. In addition, Prime Minister Okada also hopes that if he can embrace the two major political parties, he can realize a powerful national unity cabinet, so he also hopes for a political-civilian alliance. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the cabinet can maintain the status quo after the general election. In particular, the military is also favorably inclined towards the reorganization of the cabinet in the sense of a new cabinet atmosphere. Generally, many also advocate that the two major parties of the political-civilian parties should cooperate to realize a powerful national unity cabinet. Therefore, the cabinet reorganization after the general election will proceed smoothly, centered on Minister Kawasaki in the cabinet and some influential people in the two major political-civilian parties outside the cabinet.

<p>Tokyo, Foreign Minister Hirota, who has been striving for harmony with all nations in his diplomacy with Europe, America, and China since taking office, has recently been in poor health and plans to transfer the East Road and restore diplomatic relations with China to normalcy. He intends to resign at an appropriate time and recommends Ambassador Matsudaira to the UK to succeed him. If there is a dispute due to changes in the political situation or cabinet reorganization after the general election, he will take this opportunity to submit his resignation. Therefore, Ambassador Matsudaira, who is currently returning home, will have to postpone his return until after the general election is completed and the political situation is stable.

<h3>New British Emperor to be Crowned Next May</h3>
<p>And to Tour Overseas Autonomous Territories</p>
<p>London, Reuters learned from sources close to Buckingham Palace that King Edward VIII of England will likely hold his coronation ceremony in May 1937. Because at that time, all the politicians of the empire will come to Beijing to attend the ceremony, which will be a grand occasion. Therefore, the date will be announced early to prepare. The Imperial Conference, which has been postponed to 1937, will be convened around the coronation to avoid the authorities of the autonomous territories from having to make multiple trips. The coronation date will be decided after consultation with the autonomous territories. It is expected that after the coronation ceremony, the Emperor will tour Edinburgh, Belfast, and Canal Wang. Around October 1937, the Emperor will go to India to hold the Indian Emperor's coronation ceremony in Delhi. It is estimated that the Emperor will also visit various autonomous territories, but this matter is still under consideration. (Reuters Telegram of the 10th)</p>

<h3>London Silver Market Clarification: Forward Prices Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>London: Recently, the United States has not been purchasing silver in the London market, and silver forward prices have gradually trended upwards, approaching the current market price. Gold and silver brokers explained that this is evidence of the silver market trending towards clarification. A certain silver company here recently published a document discussing the silver situation. According to the document, from the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act in the United States until the end of last year, a total of 700,000,000 ounces of silver were purchased. The worldwide silver production in 1935 was approximately 206,000,000 ounces. The amount of silver shipped out from China, Japan, and Hong Kong is estimated at 350,000,000 ounces. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: Economist Chamayou recently published an article in the weekly "Capital" titled "Silver Policy and Its Dangers," also discussing the impact of silver price declines on China's currency reform. It stated, "The American government has not given up on raising the price of silver, and it continues to maintain the domestic price of silver. However, judging from various situations, the attempt to raise the price of silver will likely end in failure. Although the United States is now striving to establish bilateral treaties with other countries (such as Mexico) to revive bimetallism, the result is unlikely to be successful." Mr. Chamayou briefly mentioned the perilous state of the international situation and continued, "After the price of silver falls, silver will no longer be smuggled out of China; on the contrary, it will be smuggled into China. The commodity value of Chinese silver dollars will also be lower than their currency value. As a result, the value of the silver reserves accumulated by the Chinese government will likely decline. If that happens, the currency reform that the Chinese government has diligently implemented may encounter problems, inevitably leading to turmoil. India and French Vietnam, neighboring China, will inevitably be the first to suffer adverse effects. As far as Vietnam is concerned, once the price of Chinese currency falls, silver exports will decrease compared to before, which will reduce the amount of Vietnamese rice that the country can purchase."

<h3>Negotiations Between Hebei and Chahar Move Towards a Resolution</h3>
<p>Situation Becomes More Harmonious After Backchannel Activities - Hada and the Jin Army Plan to Establish a Naval Base</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The negotiations between Hebei and eastern Chahar had been intended, since the assembly of important Chinese and Japanese figures in Tianjin before the Spring Festival, to be conducted with sincerity in pursuit of a satisfactory resolution. In reality, twists and turns arose, and difficulties frequently occurred, causing repeated negotiations and interruptions. Although the Japanese diplomat in charge was ostensibly a certain important figure from Shenyang, his prominence attracted jealousy, and his proposals often failed to represent the entire side. The Hebei-Chahar authorities initially believed that parties other than the Shenyang figure were not qualified to negotiate. Later, discovering that the impediment lay elsewhere, they had no choice but to change their approach, starting by removing obstacles and eliminating difficulties. Chen Zhongfu, diplomatic committee member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and Chen Juesheng, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, undertook backchannel activities separately. Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying contacted Doihara independently. Only after Song Zheyuan returned to Leling to sweep ancestral tombs and met with Han Fuqu before returning to Tianjin did the diplomatic situation gradually improve. At the same time, the situation in eastern Chahar and northern Suiyuan became less tense than before. In order to thoroughly eliminate diplomatic difficulties and establish a foundation for the overall situation in North China, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council instructed standing committee member Wang Yitang, along with committee members Li Tingyu and Da Jiadeyao, to jointly draft contingency measures for the current situation. The so-called contingency measures involve pursuing resource development and economic cooperation in a peaceful manner. They also intend to formulate management measures for customs, salt, postal, telegraph, and railway matters in North China as a policy of sincerity to address Hebei-Chahar issues for those who come later. Due to these activities and factual demonstrations, rumors of a more harmonious situation have spread recently. Song Zheyuan returned to Ping accompanied by Chen Zhongfu and others at 3:55 PM on the 8th. Doihara had already arrived in Ping that morning by train to await them. The Hebei-Chahar negotiations are about to formally commence in Ping. The scope of the negotiations will still follow the outline discussed in Tianjin a month ago. A concrete solution to the Hebei-Chahar issue may be reached within ten days. However, opinions on the proposal of the puppet government in eastern Hebei are still divided, with one faction unwilling to immediately abolish it, enticed by the prestige and influence of the Hebei-Chahar authorities and enabling them to unify the entire situation in Hebei and Chahar. Those who advocate this view belong to the North China Army and military officers in Ping. The other faction advocates abolishing it but requires substantial bargaining chips that can satisfy the desires of a certain party. It would be even better if genuine autonomy could be achieved in several provinces, allowing us to demonstrate a firm break with the South. Therefore, the prospects for the negotiations are still uncertain. In the past week, many important Japanese figures have come to North China to investigate. Among them, the expansion of the North China garrison and the adoption of liaison between the army and navy are undoubtedly the most important matters. Those responsible for these matters are Colonel Shimizu and Major General Hada. Shimizu, the current chief of the First Section of the Japanese General Staff, arrived in Tianjin on the 3rd, carrying orders from his military department, to meet with Tada, commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, and Chief of Staff Nagami. They convened a meeting on the 4th to finalize the budget after the North China garrison is expanded, based on the intentions of the army central headquarters. According to the plan drafted by the North China Army, an additional 3 million yuan is required beyond the existing portion. The military department felt that this was excessive, so Shimizu brought opinions to discuss the reduction. After the decision, he departed on the 6th to contact General Minami Jiro, commander of the Kwantung Army, before returning to his country. It is expected that the proposal can be approved by mid-March, and the additional personnel for the North China garrison can come to China in May. Major General Hada Hideho, the current commander of the Lushun Naval Port, arrived in Tianjin by plane around 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, accompanied by senior staff officer Onishi Keiichi and adjutant Koseki Akira. Along the way, passing through Dagu, they conducted low-altitude reconnaissance, gaining a clear view of the harbor situation. After arriving in Tianjin, in addition to visiting various Chinese and Japanese parties and ordinary social activities, he specifically met with Commander Tada, Chief of Staff Nagami, Director of the Doihara Agency, Director Kubota of the Lushun Naval Port Tianjin Office, and Naval Attaché Kuwabara stationed in Ping at Commander's Residence in Zhang Garden to discuss liaison matters between the Japanese garrison in North China and the Navy. They decided to deepen a section of the Hai River in Dagu and Tanggu so that large warships could enter the port in case of emergency. The resolution was taken back by Hada to report to the military department and will be approved and implemented simultaneously with the North China garrison expansion plan. On the morning of the 7th, Hada and his staff went to Ping to visit various parties. On the 9th, he departed for his post. According to his statement to foreign reporters before leaving Tianjin, the mission of this visit was to examine the current situation in Ping and Tianjin after the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, as there were certain aspects that needed to be investigated. It was decided that the Japanese garrison in North China and the navy stationed in Lushun had little contact, and it was planned to stipulate cooperative measures. At the same time, there is no Japanese naval establishment in North China, and a department will be created in the future, with the Lushun Naval Port planning nearby to assist in its realization.</p>
<p>Also, a dispatch from Beiping states that the negotiations between Hebei-Chahar and Japan, after repeated informal mediation by Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Tada, Doihara, etc., seem to have made progress in the past week. Song returned to Ping on a special train on the afternoon of the 7th. Political Council members Wang Yitang, Gao Lingju, Li Tingyu, and administrative chief Pan Yugui came on the same train. Hada Hideho, commander of the Lushun fortress, accompanied by staff officer Onishi, adjutant Koseki, and military officer Kubota, arrived in Ping from Tianjin at 11:38 AM on the 7th. After getting off the train, Hada and others went directly to the city government to visit Mayor Qin Decun, then went to the Summer Palace to attend a banquet hosted by Qin Decun and visited the Dragon King Temple and Jiequ Garden before returning to the city at 6:00 PM and staying at the Beijing Hotel. Hada went to Tongxian on the 8th to inspect and met with Yin Rugeng. Doihara also arrived in Ping on the 8th. With most of the important Japanese figures having come to Ping, it is heard that the Chinese and Japanese sides will soon negotiate various Hebei-Chahar issues in Ping.</p>
<p>After Song Zheyuan returned to Ping on the 7th, he issued a statement saying that he decided to take advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to take a short rest in Tianjin and went to his ancestral grave in Leling on the 31st of last month. The journey from Tianjin to Leling took eight hours. After arriving, he first called Chairman Han (Fuqu), and the next morning, Chairman Han came from Ji'nan to meet him. They discussed the stabilization of the overall situation in North China from an objective perspective. Although no decisions were made regarding the future course of action, it must be based on the premise of the nation and the people. Anything that is detrimental to the nation and the people will not be done. Chairman Han returned to Ji'nan on the morning of the 2nd, and he stayed in Leling for two days before returning to Tianjin. Regarding the future of Chinese-Japanese diplomacy, he believes that the prerequisite is that both sides must be on an equal footing. If one side is the oppressor and the other is the oppressed, it will be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. He believes that both sides should trust each other. If they suspect each other, it will be fundamentally difficult to talk about amity. In East Asia, China and Japan must cooperate to jointly maintain peace. Therefore, sincere negotiations are needed at this moment. As for the issue of the negotiators between China and Japan, it should also be determined in advance. Currently, both sides are considering and researching the negotiations on the issues of eastern Hebei and northern Chahar. When to conduct concrete negotiations and begin to resolve them does not seem to be something that can be hastily mentioned in a day or two. The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, considering that Hebei-Chahar is a bit far from Beijing, has decided to establish an education committee to reorganize education in the two provinces in the near future. The peace in the Ping-Tianjin area during the Spring Festival was due to the gradual stabilization of the overall situation. If stability can continue for another year, the local prosperity is promising.</p>
<p>Doihara, director of the Kwantung Army Special Affairs Agency stationed in Shenyang, also issued a statement upon arriving in Ping, saying that he plans to stay in Ping for at least a month. He said that the issue of whether he will serve as an advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has not yet been decided. However, the committee does need Japanese people to serve as advisors. The progress of Chinese-Japanese negotiations that is being reported is just rumors. Although there were meetings in Tianjin, nothing has been decided. The situation in northern Chahar is very peaceful, not as tense as the rumors suggest. The issue of eastern Hebei needs to be considered before negotiations can begin. The two provinces of Hebei and Chahar in your country are not separated from the Nanjing government. However, China and Japan must stand on the basis of coexistence and co-prosperity to seek collaboration between the two countries. He cannot talk about peace. Chinese-Japanese amity is the way to East Asian peace. The elimination of misunderstandings between the two countries must start from the path of amity.</p>
<p>The Chinese-Japanese diplomatic negotiations have attracted the attention of ambassadors, ministers, and chargés d'affaires of various countries stationed in China. Some have sent personnel to stay in Ping specifically to gather information. Since the 9th, there has been a large amount of telegram traffic between Dongjiaominxiang and European foreign language telegrams. Regarding the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue, representatives from the Chinese and Japanese sides have repeatedly exchanged views in Tianjin. After Doihara arrived in Ping, it was decided that he would continue discussions with us. Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee's Diplomatic Committee, is scheduled to visit Doihara on the 10th to exchange views on diplomatic issues privately as a first step. Formal negotiations will be held after a satisfactory situation is achieved. As for the scope of negotiations, the issue of eastern Hebei will be discussed first. After the issue of eastern Hebei is resolved, negotiations on the northern Chahar incident will continue. Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying originally planned to return to Ping with Song Zheyuan, but it did not work out due to unforeseen circumstances. Xiao has changed his plans to come to Ping from Tianjin on the 10th or 11th. According to Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Diplomatic Committee, China and Japan have agreed to continue negotiations on Hebei-Chahar diplomatic matters in Ping. The focus of negotiations on the eastern Hebei issue is that we advocate abolishing the name of the war zone, but the Japanese side has not yet made a concrete statement on this, and it seems that they are trying to delay it. But if we proceed actively, a result can be expected in the short term. As for northern Hebei, although there are many rumors, they are not credible. Regarding the incident of Zhuo Shihai's troops invading the five counties of eastern Suiyuan, the official has not received any information about it. Currently, there are no Japanese troops north of Zhangjiakou, and the local area is safe. Doihara came to Ping as the representative of the Japanese side. The saying that he will serve as an advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee has not yet been fully decided. (9th)</p>

<h3>Third Fleet Commander of Japan, Oikawa, Travels South to Hong Kong and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Delivers Speech in Hong Kong on Outward Expansion, Arrives in Guangzhou for Diplomatic Courtesies</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Vice Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet in the Far East, recently arrived in Southern China aboard the Japanese warship Izumo. He arrived in Hong Kong on the 1st of the month, where he was welcomed by a gathering of Japanese residents. Oikawa delivered a brief speech at the welcoming ceremony, stating, "In the past five years, Japanese interests in Southern China and Southeast Asia have made significant progress, all thanks to the efforts of our countrymen. Japan's lifeline lies in outward expansion, and I hope that our countrymen (self-proclaimed Japanese) will strive to this end." It is said that Oikawa's decision to come south is not only for the purpose of assessing the situation in the Far East and inspecting overseas affairs, but also carries a major mission. Mr. Oikawa stayed in Hong Kong for four days, during which he paid a visit to the British naval authorities in Hong Kong.

On the morning of the 4th at 8:00 AM, Oikawa departed from Hong Kong for Guangzhou aboard the Japanese shallow-water gunboat Saga, accompanied by officers of the Japanese Third Fleet. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Saga sailed into the Pearl River. Foreign warships outside Shamian fired salutes in tribute, and the Saga returned the salute. It then anchored at White Swan Pool. Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, Tatsuo Kawasame, military attachés Nakahara and Usuda, all boarded the ship to welcome him. Oikawa then disembarked at Shamian and went to the Japanese Consulate to rest. A banquet was held at the Japanese Consulate in the evening.

Zhang and Li received Oikawa in the reception hall of the fleet headquarters on the South Embankment. The guests engaged in lively conversation, followed by champagne. After the conversation, Oikawa bid farewell and then, accompanied by the Japanese Consul and others, went directly to the Champagne Wine House to call on Mayor Liu Jiwen. Liu received him in the city hall auditorium. After exchanging pleasantries for a while, Oikawa departed and returned to the Japanese Consulate in Shamian to rest. At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Liu went to the Japanese warship to return Oikawa's visit. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Liu hosted another banquet at the city hall for Commander Oikawa. The Japanese Consul and Japanese military attachés stationed in Guangdong all attended, and dozens of Guangdong military and political officials were also in attendance. The gathering ended in good spirits until after 4:00 PM. On the morning of the 6th at 8:30 AM, Commander Oikawa went to the Japanese cemetery in Nantou, Henan, to pay respects to the deceased Japanese residents.

<h3>Suzhou Temporary Resolution of Telephone Fee Dispute</h3>
<p>The Wu County Trade Association unanimously opposed the Wu County Telephone Bureau's revised regulations, which increased monthly fees for telephones in business associations and suspended the association's telephone service due to the association's refusal to pay telephone fees. A special meeting was held on the 9th at the Wu County Chamber of Commerce to decide to strive for resolution with the Ministry of Communications. A declaration was issued, containing all circles, explaining the reason why the Bureau should not stop the chamber of commerce's calls. The Wu County Lawyers Association also held a council meeting, resolving to take the same steps as the business community. Fearing that the situation would escalate, Niu Yinchu, the director of the telephone bureau, sent Engineer Wang to the Wu County Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the 10th to visit Chairman Cheng Ganqing, expressing that the telephone suspension problem would be allowed to resume as usual. The issue of requesting a reduction in telephone fees has been raised with the Ministry of Communications by various industry merchants, and can only await the review and approval of the Ministry of Transportation. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, the county chamber of commerce telephone was connected. Telephone Bureau Engineer Wang from the First Phone Company called the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Organizing the Xingye Silk Manufacturing Company</h3>
<p>Fifteen silk merchants in the county, including Xue Shou Xuan, Qian Fenghao, Wang Huanan, Cheng Bingruo, Zheng Haiquan, Xue Runpei, Zhang Jifang, and Zheng Bingquan, recently decided to concentrate economic talents, improve the quality of raw materials, enhance silk manufacturing technology, unite in spirit, manage manufacturing, reduce costs, and strive to promote sales, in order to improve the glorious position of Chinese silk in the international market. Hopefully, from silkworms to cocoons to silk, there will be a consistent system, so that the future of the silk industry will gradually become stable. They immediately initiated the organization of the Xingye Silk Manufacturing Joint Stock Company, with a total registered capital of one million yuan, with each share worth one hundred yuan. The promoters subscribed for 150,000 yuan, and the remaining amount will be raised separately by March 15th, with share payments due by April 15th. The business objectives of the company are to purchase cocoon raw materials, manufacture and sell various types of raw silk and by-products, rent and establish silk factories within the county, and temporarily set up a preparatory office within the Silk Manufacturers' Guild. Once the new listing is released, the company can be formally established. The share subscription and collection points are the five banks in Shanghai and Wuxi: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jiangsu Provincial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin Three Opium Offenders Paraded Through the Streets</h3>
<p>Since being ordered to conduct registration of opium addicts for self-renewal and to handle reports of drug offenders, County Magistrate Dong Zhe has been working for more than a month. In addition to personally going to various districts to supervise, he also dispatched a large number of personnel to assist township and baojia leaders in conducting spot checks. To date, a total of seven to eight hundred people have been registered. On the 8th, he convened a meeting of more than one hundred district chiefs and township heads from various districts to discuss the way forward. At the same time, Yin Shaoming, Wang Bu Xue, and Cheng Guoji, three opium offenders captured by the Public Security First Branch Bureau, and Yan Bucheng, an opium addict who relapsed after quitting, were each forced to wear a conical paper hat and paraded through the four city gates as a warning to the public. Finally, Yin Shaoming and the other three were ordered to reform, released on bail for quitting. Yan Bucheng, the relapse addict, was convicted according to the law and sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Nantong Jurisdiction Issue of Shengsi Islands</h3>
<p>The Shengsi Islands, located in the mouth of the Yangtze River, consist of more than fifty islands of various sizes. They originally belonged to Chongming County. Every year, there are four major fishing seasons for yellow croaker, beltfish, jellyfish, and squid. There are no permanent residents; fishermen gather during the fishing season, mostly from eastern Zhejiang. Recently, Zhejiang Province requested that the Shengsi Islands be transferred to the administration of Zhejiang Province, which aroused opposition from Jiangsu gentry. The Ministry of Interior will conduct a joint survey with commissioners from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces sometime this month. The Nantong Special Commissioner's Office will convene a meeting of relevant parties within days to solicit opinions.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Notorious Trafficker of Opium Captured</h3>
<p>Yu Zhihe, a well-known opium trafficker in the Jiangbei region, is from Tangtou Town, Yiling East Township, Jiandu County, which borders Taixian County. Although he was ordered to be arrested by the government, he always escaped. County Magistrate Zhang of Taixian believed that Yu was engaged in the sale of drugs, cunning and secretive, and his freedom was related to the anti-drug policy. Therefore, early in the morning of the previous day, he secretly dispatched more than a dozen security team members to rush to the town and capture Yu. He also seized four large wooden boxes of opium and red pills, along with seventeen family members and associates. After a brief interrogation in the county, he immediately escorted them to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office in Zhenjiang for legal proceedings.</p>

Because they had no money for travel, they walked along the railway. When passing through the area in front of Xiaochenghuang Temple, a Jiaxing-Hangzhou train drove from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, and they did not avoid it in time. Yuan Shenshi and Fan Caixian were both seriously injured and died immediately. Fan Yuanshi was also seriously injured and has been sent to the Hangzhou Railway Hospital for treatment. The deceased were examined and coffins were prepared.</p>

<h3>Rural Economic Industry Talks</h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtang</p>
<h3>Long-Awaited Hometown Yixing (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhi</p>
<p>Breaking it down carefully, I feel that there are at least these few reasons for poverty: Industrial products (many of which are foreign goods) flow into the countryside. For the average farmer, cloth, matches, kerosene, rubber shoes, foreign socks, etc., have now become daily necessities that must be purchased from the market, and they are absolutely not self-sufficient. And clocks, radios (already very popular in various towns in Yixing, P Village has seven or eight of them.), thermoses, leather shoes, silk and wool fabrics, wool yarn, toothpaste, safety razors, fountain pens, blowtorches, MSG, biscuits, flashlights, felt hats, straw hats, and so on, there are no fewer than a hundred. Although farmers have not seen them, they have also become daily necessities for landlords. These are all directly and indirectly exchanged by farmers for grain. Farmers are still cultivating that piece of land and have no other income, and the price of grain is falling daily due to the dumping of foreign rice and wheat. The types and quantities of industrial products flowing in are increasing day by day, so how can the countryside not be poor? Machines have replaced manpower, and manual labor cannot be sold. Water pumping and rice milling machines have become popular in various towns in Yixing in the past few years, spreading from Wuxi and Changzhou. P Village has two sets of water pumping machines (which are converted into rice milling machines in winter). The nearby paddy fields are irrigated, mostly contracted by these two machine households (one is a carpenter, and the other is a landlord and businessman at the same time). On average, each mu of paddy field costs two yuan, and the machine households are responsible for ensuring that the paddy fields do not lack water from transplanting to harvesting. When milling rice, each machine can mill more than ten dan per hour, and the cost is less than one jiao per dan. This is more economical and easier than manpower by more than double. The landowners who plant the fields can use machines to reduce the use of manpower, which is to save costs. However, for the laboring farmers, their work is taken away by the machines, which means that a portion of their income is taken away by the machines. If they can obtain other work and receive compensation because they don't pump water, it will not affect their annual income. Unfortunately, under the current situation where the national industry in the cities is dying under the pressure of imperialist commodities and only reducing work without expanding, there is only the possibility of unemployed workers returning to the countryside, not the possibility of unemployed farmers gaining a foothold in the cities. Therefore, the income of farmers is taken away by machines for nothing and they do not receive compensation. The steel used to make machines and the diesel consumed by the machines are all foreign goods, so most of the money taken away from farmers by machines indirectly flows to foreign countries. So how can the countryside not be poor? Farmers pay taxes to the government, but the government does not use the tax revenue for the benefit of the farmers. The largest amount of taxes paid by farmers is the land tax (field tax). In our hometown, the land tax paid per mu per year is about one yuan and five jiao, which accounts for 15% to 20% of the total income per mu. This is a huge expense for the countryside. (Regardless of whether this land tax is paid by the landlord or someone else, the ultimate burden is still on the laboring farmers). The provincial and county governments take this money, and whether they use it for production and construction expenses to purchase foreign machinery and tools, or to run education, or as administrative expenses, only a small portion can still flow back to the countryside, which is the portion used by government officials to purchase rice, grains and vegetables. The rest flows directly or indirectly to foreign countries. Even if some of the government officials come from the countryside, they will never use their savings to reinvest in the countryside, and there is nowhere to invest. Most of them deposit the money in banks or money houses. This money does not flow into the recycling process of the countryside. With such a lack of inflow and outflow, how can the countryside not be poor? With these three reasons, in terms of the overall rural income and expenditure, there is no source to open up, and the outflow is not only not reduced, but also has a tendency to expand day by day. In the past three years, the price of silk has plummeted, and the failure of farmers' silkworm industry has been the trigger for the collapse of the rural economy. As a result, the countryside is becoming poorer day by day, and naturally finance is almost completely exhausted. The poorer the countryside, the less the capital for reproduction (in P Village, there are many farmers who are unable to buy fertilizer), and the less the harvest, and the countryside is becoming poorer as a result. The tighter the rural finance, the more prevalent the usury, and the greater the rural expenditure. (The gang forces have become very strong in P Village recently. Because the gang leader is an agent for a usurer in Wuxi who lends rice during the spring famine. When lending, one dan of rice is priced at ten yuan, which is one or two yuan more expensive than the market price. When returning rice in the autumn harvest, the price of rice is only three yuan, which is several jiao lower than the market price. With the addition of interest, borrowing one dan of rice requires returning four dan of rice after half a year. Because farmers have no access to loans, they are forced to worship him as their boss, so that they can borrow rice). As it intensifies, the countryside becomes poorer and poorer.</p>
<p>In recent years, the government and financial figures have been vigorously promoting cooperatives and rural lending. Even if they can do their best (in fact, there is much room for criticism), they can only reduce the exploitation of usury and merchants. For the three reasons mentioned above that constitute the collapse of the rural economy, it has not moved a single point, so how much effort can it make to complete the task of rescuing the countryside?</p>
<p>Four,</p>
<p>Finally, here are some fragmented thoughts. In the countryside, women under the age of twenty have all unbound feet, which gives them the same operating conditions as men. Some young women are already doing work such as carrying burdens and cultivating, which was not available in P Village before. This gives them a foothold to gain economic equality with men. Some wives are already urging their lazy husbands. This cannot but be said to be an achievement in the Chinese women's liberation movement.</p>
<p>Last year, Yixing suffered a severe rice stem borer disaster. Some areas were more severely damaged than the drought in 1934. Farmers only know how to perform dramas and offer sacrifices to the gods, and do not know how to use scientific methods such as lights or digging up the roots to eliminate it (this method is only effective when done on a large scale, and even if farmers know it, they are unable to do it). On the day I came out of the countryside, when I passed through Shushan Wharf, I saw many well-printed posters on the walls, writing "To increase rice production, we must eliminate the rice stem borer," "To eliminate the rice stem borer, we must dig out the rice roots and burn them," etc. Only then did I realize that a rice stem borer elimination movement had just passed.</p>
<p>A doctor practicing medicine in P Village told me many of her medical experiences, which are very interesting for people who pay attention to rural hygiene. She said that the diseases of rural people (referring to adults) are mostly severe infectious diseases, such as lung disease (rare among real farmers), summer and autumn malaria, dysentery, cholera, intestinal obstruction, keratitis, etc. Colds, neurasthenia, indigestion and other urban fashionable diseases are not very common. Venereal diseases are now increasing year by year. Rural people are not necessarily opposed to Western medicine and superstitious about shamans and Chinese medicine. The first problem is the problem of money. Many rural people do not have money, so even if they are sick, if it is not very serious (especially girls), they do not consult a doctor, and even if they seek medical treatment, they go to cheap places. The consultation fee and medicine of Western medicine are very expensive. She does not charge a consultation fee there, and the medicine fee is also charged according to the person, so the business is very good (but she does not make money). Secondly, there are indeed some highly skilled specialist Chinese medicine practitioners, and Western medicine is really highly skilled, and it is easier to gain people's faith.</p>
<p>Many of my former elementary school classmates have grown up, or have children. Each one follows their own family circumstances. Some have become township chiefs, or so-called "teachers", and some have become the backbone of the production process. On the day before I left my hometown, I was awakened by the beautiful childhood memories of searching for flowers and playing in the water, and wanted to visit those places in the mountains ten years ago, where there were orchids and streams in the woods. When I arrived at the mountain, I met a former classmate who sat next to me. He was gathering firewood there, and he could still vaguely recognize me when we met. The passage of time and the changes in everyone's life made the former partners seem unfamiliar to each other, as if there was a thick glass wall between them. After greeting each other, there was nothing to think of to say, and we had to smile at each other and part ways. From his expression, he seemed ashamed that he did not have the strength to graduate from middle school and university, and get a post outside, but still wielded the hoe and sickle. At that time, I felt very sorry for him. His kind of strong, simple, sincere attitude and expression left a deep impression and will always be in my heart. (The End)</p>

The Ministry of Communications has high expectations for these three gentlemen, Cai, Tan, and Lao, who are now the new General and Deputy Managers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The term of office for the General Manager is five years, and the term of office for the Deputy Managers is five years and two years, respectively, which is different from the previous three-year term for the General Manager. It is hoped that the new appointees will focus on managing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and not engage in other businesses, so as to concentrate their efforts on developing the business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. A very good result is expected in the future. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was recovered and became state-owned, a Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee have been established. In the beginning, a lot of effort was spent on recovering the shares. Fortunately, through the meticulous planning of the Directors and Supervisors and the former General Manager Liu, the business has gradually improved. However, the old debts from the past are too large, making it difficult to clear them up in a short period of time. During this time of global economic panic and shipping decline, it is not easy to maintain for several years. However, the Directors and Supervisors and the former General Manager Liu insisted on resigning because the matter was of great importance. After repeated attempts to persuade them to stay failed, their resignations were reluctantly approved. However, we are very grateful for their efforts in maintaining the company for several years. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously established a reorganization committee, which was initially under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, then under the National Government, and later returned to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. During the reorganization period, the number of employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was not specified, resulting in many people being nominally employed but not reporting for duty or performing their duties. Now, the organizational charter has been revised, specifying the number of personnel and allowing only two secretaries, who will be selected through examinations, and must be practical and realistic. The new General and Deputy Managers should not bring in personal staff and should implement the reorganization plan approved by the Executive Yuan one by one. However, it is hoped that local leaders will assist in reforming the old malpractices, developing the business, and completing the state-run shipping industry, which would be a great blessing for the country."</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Speech: General Manager Cai's speech briefly stated: "I have been ordered to take over the position of General Manager of this bureau. I am deeply grateful for Minister Yu's personal instructions and the guidance of all the distinguished guests. Regarding the administrative aspects of this bureau, Minister Yu has already given instructions, so I will not elaborate further. This bureau has a long history in the shipping industry in our country, and its past circumstances are well known to the colleagues of this bureau. However, the transportation industry is interdependent with the national industry. Our country's industry is lagging behind, and we are facing a national crisis. If we do not strive to develop transportation, we cannot talk about economic recovery, let alone survival. In national transportation, railways are on land, and shipping is on the waterways. In recent years, our country's railways have made considerable progress. This bureau should catch up quickly in order to go hand in hand and jointly save the dying industry. Fortunately, the former Supervisors, Directors, and General Manager Liu have carefully planned and reorganized the business of this bureau in recent years. I am determined to take over the bureau's affairs, abide by the Minister's orders and the government's newly promulgated policies, and be responsible for handling them. After taking over, I will carefully study the reorganization plan to ensure that business revenue is maximized, all expenses are rationalized, and personnel are employed in accordance with economic principles. We will rectify the transportation of goods and passengers to reduce unexpected and unreasonable losses for customers. As for all outstanding debts, we will also be responsible for reorganizing them as soon as possible. All measures will be taken with the country as the priority, the individual as the secondary, the national interest as the priority, and individual rights as the secondary. We will be honest and law-abiding, and each will do their best to make the organization and finances of this bureau rationalized and fully serve the country and society. I am willing to encourage my colleagues in this bureau to achieve this goal. Furthermore, the business of this bureau is complex, and the responsibility is heavy. My personal knowledge and abilities are limited. Under the modern principle of division of labor, cooperation should be the prerequisite. The colleagues of this bureau must work together to overcome difficulties and strive for success. I also hope that the former Supervisors, Directors, and General Manager Liu will not hesitate to provide guidance, and I hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and supervision at any time. This bureau will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate."</p>
<p>Additional Deputy Manager: The new organizational charter of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stipulates that there should be one General Manager and two Deputy Managers. In addition to General Manager Cai Zengji and Deputy Manager Tan Boying, who have been officially appointed, the Ministry of Communications yesterday also appointed Lao Mian as the Deputy Manager of the bureau. He assumed office at the bureau yesterday at the same time as Cai and Tan. Mr. Lao has previously held important positions such as bank manager and railway bureau director, and his experience and knowledge are very rich.</p>
<p>Handover Completed: The handover procedures for the bureau's Board of Directors, Supervisory Committee, and General Manager's Office were completed yesterday morning by former General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Secretary Yu Zhiyi, and newly appointed General Manager Cai Zengji, Secretary Ma Shaohuai, under the supervision of Lu Rongguang, the representative of the Ministry of Communications. The handover of various departments was received separately by Deputy Managers Tan and Lao. A telegram will be sent to the Ministry of Communications to report this. The former directors and deputy directors of various departments and secretaries who have resigned will be issued severance pay in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Three Gentlemen: Cai Zengji is a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong. He graduated from the Department of Economics and Diplomacy at Columbia University in the United States. He has served as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, a diplomatic commissioner of the Two Guangxi Governor's Headquarters, the Director of the Guangzhou Land Bureau, the manager of the Hong Kong Port Commercial Bank, the Director of the Finance Bureau of the National Government's Ministry of Finance, the Director of the Management Department of the Ministry of Railways, the Director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, a specialist of the Construction Committee, and the Mayor of Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He also served as the Director of the Shanghai Finance Bureau and the Land Bureau. Tan Boying graduated from the Department of Engineering at Peking University in 1918. He then served as the director of academic affairs and a full-time professor at specialized schools. In 1920, he went to Europe and the United States to study industries and land and water transportation. He returned to China in 1921 and handled the light rail railway between Shanghai and Nanhui, which was very successful. Later, he went to Germany to specialize in the mechanical engineering of land and water transportation equipment. He stayed in Germany for seven years, graduated from the Department of Engineering at the University of Berlin with a degree in engineering from the national examination, and served as an engineer at the Berlin Train Factory. He returned to China in 1927, and when the municipal government was established, Tan was invited as an engineering expert to work in the Public Works Bureau. In 1929, he acted as the Director of the Public Works Bureau. During his time at the Public Works Bureau, Tan managed the municipal ferry, which was very successful. He has always advocated that public utilities must be commercialized in order to develop. In 1933, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company was established, and the municipal government transferred the entire municipal ferry business to the company for management, so that it could have long-term progress under commercialization. The company then hired Tan as its manager. In 1934, he also served as the general manager. Tan has always had special expertise in technology and is said to have great talent and魄力 in business management. Therefore, he presided over the municipal ferry for nine years, focusing his energy and never being careless. His management was scientific. Tan is a generous and kind-hearted person who shares weal and woe with his employees. He is fair and impartial, with strict rewards and punishments. The municipal ferry has hundreds of employees, all of whom are happy to be服. Even though they work until 11 p.m. every day, they never complain. Therefore, all the equipment of the municipal ferry is modern, and the business is still profitable every year, which is very commendable. When the municipal ferry was transferred from the Ditches Bureau, its assets were only a few thousand yuan, but now the assets of the municipal ferry have reached more than 1.6 million yuan. He created this great enterprise bare-handed over nine years, which is admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Lao Mian, courtesy name Shaomian, is a native of Nanhai, Guangdong. He graduated from Meiji University in Japan. He has served as the Director of the Guangdong Guangsan Railway Bureau and the Deputy Director of the North Railway Administration before resigning.</p>
<p>Appointment of Staff: The most important departments in the bureau are the Business Department, the Shipping Department, and the General Affairs Department, and the Treasury. The Director of the Business Department is concurrently held by Tan Boying, and the Deputy Director has been appointed Zhou Fengtu, the Director of the Joint Transportation Division. The Director of the Shipping Department has not yet been announced, and the Deputy Director Zhou Houkun, who is still in office, is temporarily acting as the director of department affairs. Cai Zhongming has been appointed as the Director of the Treasury. Wang Xiangchen is the Director of the General Affairs Department, and Chen Bingchi is the Deputy Director. Ma Shaohuai and Chen Guoquan are the secretaries. The monthly salary for directors of the departments has been 400 yuan, and the public expense is 200 yuan. The monthly salary for deputy directors is 300 yuan, and the public expense is 100 yuan. Due to cost reductions, the public expenses for both the directors and deputy directors will be cancelled. However, the Chief of the Ship, Shen Jiyun, has resigned, and no new person has been appointed to fill the position.</p>
<p>Examination for Bureau Employees: According to those who reported to the bureau yesterday, there are a total of 191 employees in the bureau. However, according to Minister Yu, the newly established regulations of the bureau stipulate that the total number of employees in various departments should be limited to 82. This means that two-thirds of the original number of employees must be eliminated. The elimination method will be based on an examination system, with the superiority or inferiority of experience and knowledge as the standard for the retention of employees. Cai Zengji has requested the Ministry of Communications to send personnel to preside over the examination, and he said that the examination methods can be announced in two or three days. This is the first step in rectifying the internal affairs of the bureau.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Expresses Opinions on the Telephone Rate Increase Controversy Yesterday Morning.</h3>
<p>Believes That It Cannot Be Solved by Theory and Should Use Facts to Prompt the Company to Reflect. The Telephone Committee Scheduled to Negotiate with the French Municipal Council Again.</p>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the issue of the disguised telephone rate increase in the Special District has attracted attention from all sectors. The Telephone Issue Committee has learned that the French Municipal Council is scheduled to hold another meeting on the 15th of this month to discuss the issue, so it decided to send representatives to negotiate on a scheduled basis. The committee received a letter from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, expressing their opinions on the telephone issue. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Taxpayers' Association Expresses Its Position: The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association wrote a letter to the Special District Telephone Issue Committee yesterday, stating: "In reply to your letter of February 6, regarding the disguised telephone rate increase by the Shanghai Telephone Company, we have received it. The method of inviting telephone experts to study the issue was originally a suggestion made by the Taxpayers' Association. The scope of research granted by the Public Works Bureau to these experts is extremely narrow. Our association has sent a letter to the bureau requesting that it expand the scope, but the bureau refused to adopt it. The Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding the decline in Shanghai's economy and the financial difficulties of users, insisted that the Public Works Bureau fulfill the contract. Therefore, this case cannot be solved by theory. Only the trend of facts can prompt the company to reflect. We have sent the letter to you for your reference. Respectfully, to the Special District Telephone Issue Committee."</p>
<p>Scheduled to Go to the French Municipal Council for Negotiation: The Special District Telephone Issue Committee has learned that the French Municipal Council will make a final discussion on the telephone rate increase issue on the 15th of this month. In order to urge the French Municipal Council to pay attention to public opinion, the committee has appointed Li Aokui, Qu Zhenhua, Gu Wensheng, Mao Yun, Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, and others to go to the Municipal Council again on the 14th of this month to negotiate, demanding that the public opinion of taxpayers be accepted and that the company's disguised rate increase be rejected, so as to avoid causing serious disputes.</p>
<p>Sub-District Associations Discuss Methods: The fifth, seventh, twelfth, twenty-seventh, thirtieth, and thirty-seventh sub-district associations of the First Special District Citizens' Federation held meetings in their respective association halls yesterday afternoon and invited telephone users in the district to attend. After discussion, in addition to determining the final effective method, personnel have been assigned to investigate the number of users in the district and fill out the survey forms, so that they can make a strong statement when necessary. It is also learned that the First and Second Special District Citizens' Federations have scheduled to convene representative conferences on the 15th of this month to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Citizens' Federation Gathered to Discuss Countermeasures: The First Special District Citizens' Federation held its thirteenth Executive Committee meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures against the telephone rate increase. After reporting on the incoming letters from various parties, they discussed the following resolution: "The Special District telephone disguised rate increase will be implemented soon. How should we express our opposition?" The resolution was: (A) Send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to immediately convene a taxpayers' conference. (B) Send a letter to the Telephone Issue Committee to convene a joint meeting of various groups as soon as possible to determine a method. (C) Schedule a meeting of representatives from various sub-district associations on the afternoon of the 15th of this month to discuss whether to also convene a representative conference in each district, in order to unify steps. (D) Notify the various sub-district associations to inform telephone users to prepare for resistance.

The fares and postage fees will be determined after the test flight. The Peiping-Guangdong line will also be restored in the short term. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparations Completed: After the Ministry of Communications ordered Eurasia Aviation Corporation to open the Beijing-Yunnan air route last year, it immediately began planning. The entire route is approximately 2,000 kilometers long, passing through Nanchang, Changsha, Guiyang, and Kunming, with a total of five stops. The preparations have been completed. In addition to the existing stations in Nanjing, Nanchang, and Changsha, the establishment of airports and branch stations in Guiyang and Kunming has been actively deployed and will be completed within this week.</p>

<p>Peiping-Guangdong Air Route: The Eurasia air route from Peiping to Guangzhou was suspended after the airport in Hankou and Changsha were destroyed by the floods last autumn. The Ministry of Communications has ordered Eurasia Company to make efforts to restore it. The airports in both places have now been repaired and are more solid than before. According to the reporter's inquiry to the company, it has been decided that the Peiping-Guangdong line will be restored after the opening of the Beijing-Yunnan line.</p>
<h3>Li Jingcong Denies Eurasia Aviation Price Reduction</h3>
<p>Newspaper Reports are Pure Misinformation; Prices on All Routes Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>It was reported that Eurasia Aviation Corporation, in order to promote air travel convenience for the public, announced that from February 1st to April 30th, the prices for all Shanghai-Pingliang, Lanzhou-Baotou, and Pingliang-Guangdong flights, including cargo transportation, would be discounted to 75% of the original price. However, the reporter from the "Daily News" recently interviewed Mr. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company. Mr. Li solemnly denied this, stating that the rumors circulating outside are completely untrue. The company has not issued any such announcement recently. Furthermore, the company's price adjustments must be in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Transportation. Currently, all routes, whether for passengers or cargo, are operating at the original prices without any changes.</p>
<h3>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross Will Still Proceed to South China</h3>
<p>Will Return to Shanghai Afterwards; Destination Undecided; Rumors of Returning Home to Visit Japan and Cancelling the Trip South are Untrue</p>
<p>A dispatch from Japan reported that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British economic advisor specially sent to China, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for his home country in early next month, and will make a detour via Japan to meet with Japanese authorities. However, according to absolutely reliable news obtained by the "New Sound News" reporter, the various reports from Japan are merely a form of disinformation and are not to be trusted. As for the remarks made by Sir Frederick's assistant, Mr. Baji Jun, as reported in the newspapers, that Sir Frederick would cancel his trip to South China because his official duties in Shanghai were not yet completed and he needed to return home urgently, when the "New Sound News" reporter met with Mr. Baji Jun yesterday morning, Mr. Baji Jun completely denied this and stated that he had not made such remarks to anyone. Currently, Sir Frederick is still maintaining his original plan and has decided to continue to Hong Kong and then Guangzhou to conduct investigations in various parts of South China. However, the date of his departure is still undetermined. After completing his investigations in South China, he will need to return to Shanghai. This is the established plan and there is no change. As for his itinerary after returning to Shanghai from South China, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>After the Collision of the Tongshun Steamer, the Shipowner Sends a Telegram to Shanghai for Help</h3>
<p>Crew Members Leave the Ship and Land at Haikou; Insurance Company Cables Hong Kong to Find Ways to Rescue the Ship</p>
<p>The Tongshun steamer, belonging to the Datongxing Steamer Company, ran aground near Mafu Cape on Hainan Island on the morning of February 8th. The shipowner telegraphed for assistance, and the insurance company is currently seeking ways to rescue the ship. Some of the crew members have left the ship and landed at Haikou. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dispatching a Ship for Rescue: After the Tongshun steamer ran aground at Mafu Cape, the ship struck a large rock and the front cabin was flooded. The shipowner telegraphed Shanghai, requesting that a tugboat with a water pump be dispatched quickly to tow and rescue the ship. After Mr. Zhou Zian, the manager of the Shanghai company, consulted with the China Ship Insurance Federation, which provided the Ping An insurance, they requested that Mitsui dispatch a ship for rescue. Because the accident site was at Mafu Cape, Mitsui replied by telegram that it was unable to dispatch a ship. Therefore, it immediately telegraphed the Hong Kong Dockyard to dispatch a ship to rush to the rescue.</p>
<p>Shipowner's Plea for Help: The Datongxing Shanghai Company also received a telegram yesterday from Pu Li, the shipowner of the Tongshun, stating that the ship was flooding and in great danger. Except for the shipowner, the chief mate, second mate, chief engineer, and second engineer, who remained on board to watch over the ship, the compradore and sailors had all left the ship and landed at Haikou. If no ship was dispatched for rescue, they would decide to abandon the ship and disembark. It is predicted that the ship cannot be rescued.</p>
<p>Further News: The break in the front cabin of the Tongshun is very large. Initially, the water ingress was five feet. Until yesterday's telegram, it was said that both the front and rear cabins had been breached and were flooding. Currently, the water in the front cabin has reached ten feet, causing the bow to sink. Although the stern is also flooded, it is raised high, making the situation extremely dangerous. It may be difficult to safely rescue the ship immediately. The rescue ship from the Whampoa Dockyard will arrive at the Mafu Strait. We will wait for further news. The Tongshun steamer is insured with the Shanghai Ship Insurance Federation for hull and machinery Ping An insurance of 95,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hoover Encounters Fog; New American Consul General Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>

At that time, Mr. Zhou Jue, the Director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Office in Shanghai, as well as personnel from the American Consulate General, will be at the port to welcome him. Mr. Gauss has been transferred from his position as Consul General in Paris. He has been to Shanghai multiple times. It is also known that the Chinese-American film star Ms. Anna May Wong is also returning home on the same ship.</p>

<h3>Party and Government Agencies Summon Pig Industry Groups to Discuss Hair Cutting Method Yesterday</h3>
<p>Import of Pigs with Bristles Banned from March 1st; Subsequent Live Hair Plucking Will Be Considered Animal Cruelty</p>
<p>According to "New Sound News," the municipal Party and government authorities, in order to discuss the elimination of live hair plucking, specially summoned relevant trade associations at 2:00 PM yesterday to solicit opinions and discuss and decide on methods as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Wang Gang, Yu Zhenhui from the Social Affairs Bureau; Li Weixiong from the Municipal Party Headquarters; Nong Qiangfu from the Public Security Bureau; Gu Tingxuan from the Health Bureau; Shi Yizheng from the Fresh Pork Vendor Trade Association; Xu Jianzhang from the Fresh Pork Slaughtering Trade Association; Gu Baoxiang from the Fresh Pork Industry Trade Association; Zhang Ping from the Fresh Pork Industry Trade Union; Chairman Wang Gang; Recorder Jiang Shifu</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: First, Chairman Wang Gang reported that live hair plucking is not only animal cruelty but also detrimental to hygiene. Although the government has repeatedly issued orders prohibiting live plucking, this type of dispute still occurs frequently. On April 23rd and 31st, the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security and Health Bureaus, successively summoned representatives from the Fresh Pork Vendor Trade Association, the Fresh Pork Industry Trade Union, and slaughtering representatives from the entire city to inquire and solicit effective measures to eliminate live hair plucking. Both labor and management in the pig industry advocated cutting off the bristles as a fundamental solution. After experimental results, it was deemed that this method of cutting the bristles before slaughtering has no impact on slaughtering, butcher shops, or hygiene. Therefore, the Social Affairs, Health, and Public Security Bureaus met again at the Health Bureau and decided to adopt it, and decided to summon representatives from the pig industry trade association and trade union today to inquire about opinions on the implementation method of hair cutting experiments. Before the hair cutting method is officially announced, better methods can also be proposed for reference.</p>
<p>Key Resolutions: The Municipal Social Affairs, Health, and Public Security Bureaus discussed the issue of eliminating live hair plucking and made two key resolutions. From February 20th of this year, when pigs are imported, they must first have their bristles cut off before they are allowed to be imported in order to prevent the cruel act of live plucking for profit. In the future, any live hair plucking will be considered animal cruelty and will be punished promptly in accordance with Article 7 of the Municipal Livestock Slaughter Inspection Regulations. The Public Security Bureau will issue an order to its subordinates to comply with and strictly enforce it. At yesterday's meeting, after first soliciting opinions from representatives of relevant trade associations, the agencies discussed and decided on various proposals. A. Regarding Article 1 of the original resolution, due to the urgency of time, the original date of February 20th of this year was changed to March 1st of this year. When pig boats reach the Wusongkou, the Health and Public Security Bureaus will send personnel to jointly inspect. If pigs with bristles are found, the Public Security Bureau will prohibit them from entering. They will only be allowed to enter after the bristles have been cut off by themselves. If pig vendors and merchants transport pigs with bristles to Shanghai before the government order is clarified, resulting in them not being able to enter, the Pig Vendor Trade Association may assist the merchants in cutting off the bristles. However, this assistance in hair cutting is limited to the end of March of this year. When handling the above-mentioned assistance in hair cutting, the Pig Vendor Trade Association should request the local public security agency to send police to protect it at any time. B. Regarding Article 2 of the original resolution, if live hair plucking is discovered, the person in charge of the location where the live hair plucking occurred should be responsible for identifying the perpetrator. Otherwise, the person in charge of the location where the live hair plucking occurred must guarantee the fine.</p>
<h3>Specialist for Assessing the Collection from the Palace Museum Discusses the Assessment of Furs</h3>
<p>Total of 39 Boxes, Mostly Sable Skins; Newspaper Reports of Value Exceeding 10 Million Yuan are Inaccurate</p>
<p>In December, Mr. Chen Daode and Mr. Wang Guifang were hired as specialists to undertake the assessment work. The reporter from the Industrial News visited Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang yesterday, and they provided a general overview of the process. We (Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang) were entrusted by the Palace Museum to assess the furs stored in Shanghai. We scheduled a time to work in the warehouse according to the museum's rental procedures. We assessed the name of each item, categorized the grades, estimated the value, and recorded them in a booklet, and signed the assembly sheet to indicate responsibility and show solemnity. The furs were packed in a total of 39 boxes, mostly whole sable skins, as well as fox, muskrat, and other categories. Although there were some rare items, the total estimated value is far from the reported 10 million yuan or more. Furthermore, the prices of furs have been very low in recent years. This estimate is based on market prices, and no matter how rare the items are, they would not be worth such a large sum. The newspaper reports are not accurate.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts Dinner for Famous Collectors</h3>
<p>To Solicit Exhibits for the Municipal Museum</p>
<p>After the new building for the Municipal Museum was completed last winter, a preparatory office was established within the China Arts and Science Society. Over the past few months, progress has been made gradually. Previously, collectors from both within and outside the city were solicited for exhibits. More than 10,000 pieces of ancient artifacts, such as bronze and stone artifacts, ceramics, oracle bone inscriptions, and rubbings, have been received. In order to enrich the content, Mayor Wu hosted a dinner last night at his private residence on Haig Road to entertain famous collectors and academic elders. Those who came from afar, such as Nanjing and Suzhou, made the journey to Shanghai, including Cai Yuanpei, Ding Fubao, Wang Yiting, Yan Ganyuan, Li Bake, Huang Binhong, Zhang Shuqi, Zhang Congyu, Zhang Shanzi, Wen Susong, Zhou Zijing, Wei Juxian, Pan Boshan, Ye Yuhu, Cheng Yansheng, Guan Fuchu, and others. They were all present. The Mayor and the Head of the First Section, Li Dachao, and his staff, provided hospitality. During the dinner, the Mayor reported on the plans and construction of the museum, expressed his gratitude for the assistance of all sectors, and hoped that collectors across the country would donate or deposit exhibits as much as possible. Following this, Section Chief Li reported on the progress of the preparations and the donations and deposits from various sectors. Xu Jiyu and Ye Yuhu have already sent hundreds of ancient mirrors, bronze and stone artifacts, calligraphy, paintings, ceramics, oracle bones, and Tang Dynasty sutras. Ding Fubao, He Xufu, Wu Shenfan, Gan Hansen, Gu Dingmei, Di Pingzi, and Yang Cangbai have agreed to send more than 10,000 pieces of ancient coins, bronze and stone artifacts, ceramics, calligraphy, paintings, and rubbings. Chairman Ye gave a speech on the importance of the Shanghai Municipal Museum for China's international standing, the significance of museums for cultural education, and that museums are for public research, not just for private appreciation. As long as something is valuable and meaningful, even a scrap of paper is worth collecting. He hoped that everyone present would support and participate in this grand event. After the speech, Cheng Yansheng donated Babylonian cuneiform clay bricks, Wei Juxian donated stone tools unearthed from Wanquan, Teng Gu donated ancient artifacts unearthed from the Northwest, and Xuan Guyu donated utensils, calligraphy, and paintings. The rest agreed to donate or deposit various items. The guests and hosts parted happily at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Association to Hold Annual Meeting in the Northern District Today</h3>
<p>Public Memorial for Deceased Director Fu Songnian; Enrollment of Various Firms Completed; Market Resumes Afternoon Trading</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association will hold its annual meeting at the Money Trade Hall in the Northern District at 11:00 AM today. The market will resume afternoon foreign exchange trading from the 15th. The enrollment of various firms has been completed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Annual Meeting and Memorial for Director: The Money Trade Association, in addition to holding its annual meeting on February 5th (the 13th day of the first lunar month) at the Inner Garden in the Southern District to report on association affairs and discuss new business guidelines, will also hold its annual meeting on February 11th (the 19th day of the first lunar month) at the Money Trade Hall in the Northern District to publicly memorialize deceased directors. At the same time, the deceased executive committee member of the association, Fu Songnian, will be enshrined. Managers and assistant managers of various firms will attend the luncheon.</p>
<p>Resumption of Afternoon Trading: The money trade market publishes the foreign exchange rate daily, dividing it into the morning session at 9:00 AM and the afternoon session at 12:00 PM. However, since the end of the year and the initial opening of the market, only the morning session at 9:00 AM has been open. The Market Committee announced yesterday, "From February 15th, the afternoon session will resume. This announcement is hereby made." The foreign exchange rate at 9:00 AM yesterday was 7 fen per 1,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>Enrollment Completed: Forty-nine remittance and money exchange firms are listed on the market, including Fuyuan. Except for Binchang, which has voluntarily closed down, only eighteen firms remain. After being listed, account information was sent to each client. As of today, the 18th day of the first lunar month, the forms have been completed. However, this year's enrollment restricts the number of overdrafts and requires reliable guarantees.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Negotiation to Cancel Cattle and Sheep Tax in French Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association of this city, requesting negotiations to abolish the cattle and sheep transit tax levied by the French Concession and to abolish the regulations requiring forced pre-purchase of limited-time tickets. The association submitted a report to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating (above omitted): Upon investigation, the name of this transit tax is extremely unfair. Cattle and sheep passing through the concession from outside the concession are, in terms of territory, within the scope of Shanghai and are not transported from Country A to Country C, requiring passage through Country B. How can a goods tax be forcibly collected? In the past, when the likin tax was not abolished, goods transported from place A to place B were subject to a transit tax, which was inconvenient for both Chinese and foreign merchants. How can China have abolished the likin tax, while the French Concession has created a similar transit tax to obstruct the passage of goods? By analogy, wouldn't it be possible to collect transit taxes on French merchant goods passing through the Chinese area to reach the French Concession? According to the previous letter, we reasonably request that you review and approve this matter and immediately negotiate with the French Consul to abolish the tax, as it is in the public interest.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Bar Association Convention, The 7th Convention's Preparations Near Completion</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony to be Held on the 16th of this Month; Venue: China Arts and Science Society in the French Concession</p>
<p>The Chinese Bar Association Convention is a convention of delegates elected by various provincial bar associations, convened annually in provinces and cities with convenient transportation to make decisions. This year, it is Shanghai's turn to host. The Shanghai Bar Association is responsible for the preparations and has organized the "Preparatory Committee for the 7th Chinese Bar Association Convention." After repeated preparatory meetings, it was decided that the opening ceremony will be held at 9:00 AM on the 16th of this month at the China Arts and Science Society on Jin Shenfu Road, Avenue Emmanuel. The preliminary meeting will be held at 2:00 PM. When the delegates arrive in Shanghai, they are scheduled to gather at 572 Belle Road, the Shanghai Bar Association, on the 15th. The preparatory committee members will accompany the delegates to visit various agencies in the city. It is also scheduled that on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week, the delegates will separately visit the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the Third Branch, the Shanghai District Court, the First Special District District Court, the Second Special District District Court, the Jiangsu Second Prison, the Huade Road Prison, the Xue Huali Road Second Special District Prison, the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Zhenru Forensic Institute of the Ministry of Justice, municipal center construction, the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus, and the Aili Garden. Yesterday, the Preparatory Committee for the 7th Chinese Bar Association Convention, together with the Shanghai Bar Association, sent letters to various agencies to confirm the dates for the visits. It is also reported that the Preparatory Committee has set up a registration office for delegates at the Shanghai Bar Association, scheduled to open on the 12th of this month, requesting all delegates to register upon arrival.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Bar Association elected Shen Junru, Zhang Shizhao, Yan Yinwu, and Liu Zuwang as delegates to the 7th Convention, it notified all members to submit any proposed recommendations for the convention to the association before the 12th of this month for submission to the convention for discussion.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Sent a Letter Yesterday Requesting the Flood Relief Association to Allocate Funds to Relieve the Flood Victims</h3>
<p>The Flood Relief Association Agreed to Allocate 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng sent a letter to the All-China Flood Relief Association yesterday, stating, "Allow me to inform you that Director Liu of the Chinese Women's Abstinence Association sent a letter stating that more than 100 flood refugees who have been displaced in the concessions and begging for a living have come to the Shanghai Women's and Children's Education Center, which is affiliated with the association, due to the cold weather and the difficulty of being caught by the police. However, the center is already full, and it is not easy to raise donations, so it is difficult to expand for the time being. Therefore, although they are temporarily settled, if they cannot get outside assistance within four or five days, they will inevitably be disbanded. If that happens, they will resume begging in the city, which will not only tarnish the international image but also hinder humanity and public order. As the mayor is the highest official in the city and is also in charge of important matters of the Flood Relief Association, I implore you to find a way to resettle them. Therefore, I specially sent Ms. Wu Wenqing, the director of the service department of our association, to come and ask for instructions on how to proceed." Upon receiving this, it is appropriate to forward it and hope that you will review it, consider the flood victims, and allocate one or two thousand yuan from the donation funds to be handed over to the center for resettlement and relief. The association approved the allocation of 1,000 yuan by Vice President Xu Shiying after receiving the letter.</p>
<h3>Headquarters Office of the Aviation Association Fundraising Team Holds 46th Office Meeting</h3>
<p>Aviation Exhibition Closes in Northern Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The headquarters office of the Fundraising Team of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Chinese Aviation Association held its 46th office meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss the progress and direction of fundraising. Attendees included Director-General Li Dachao, staff members Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Gu Shangrui, Zhang Xiamin, Liu Songtao, Chen Shuo, Zhu Shengyang, Li Huiran, Bao Lengxue, Song Zhenglu, Zhang Yan, Wei Jianxin, and Huang Jun. Director-General Li chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo served as the recorder. The chairman reported briefly that since the fundraising work of various fundraising teams began, thanks to the efforts and support of compatriots from all walks of life, the results have been excellent. The closing date was previously notified, but some fundraising teams are still actively promoting, so the date must be extended. It is now stipulated that the school team leaders will end at the end of February, and the team leaders from other sectors will end at the end of March. Field staff should carefully assess the situation and work diligently. The China Flying Society is holding a sightseeing flight using new training aircraft to promote social atmosphere, promote interest in flying, and familiarize people with aerial maneuvers. It will begin soon. The wine and restaurant industry is collecting aviation salvation funds. The Chinese and Western wine and restaurant industries in the city enthusiastically love the country and voluntarily suggested that the association convene various wine and restaurant associations to discuss and decide to collect one percent of their business income, starting from the first of this month. This matter is purely voluntary from the Chinese people, so the results have been excellent in less than ten days. The boiled water industry also sent a letter requesting that the Aviation Salvation Fund be established. However, boiled water is a daily necessity for the people. In order to promote fundraising, the association has hired Li Shengxian, the chairman of the industry association, as the team leader and deputy team leader to carry out the plan, and has sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and various bureaus to investigate the business conditions. The association has been gradually replying to them. Today, the association has convened the industry to discuss the direction of the plan, and the date of commencement of fundraising will be decided after the meeting. The Shanghai North District Aviation Salvation Simple Mobile Exhibition was opened on the 20th of last month, and "visitors were very enthusiastic." It officially closed on the 10th and will continue at the Great World on Avenue Edward in the Special District, starting on the 20th. Fundraising in other industries is progressing smoothly and the results are excellent. After the field staff reported on the progress of liaison and inspection, several fundraising proposals were discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Another Development in the Gu Zhuxuan Case; It is Still Unknown Whether the Sentence Can Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage and a native of Yancheng, and Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, were involved in the murder of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, and were suspected of instigating murder. The Police Bureau arrested Wang and Gu one after another and handed them over to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. After the trial, the court determined that the two defendants had indeed committed the crime and sentenced Wang to life imprisonment, depriving him of civil rights for life, and Gu to 15 years of imprisonment, depriving him of civil rights for 10 years. Because Wang and Gu did not accept the verdict, they separately appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court conducted a rigorous investigation of the two cases and opened a collegial panel on the 4th of this month to hear the cases and announced the end of the debate. The sentences were scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM today (the 11th). This has been detailed in this newspaper. It is now heard that another development has occurred in the Gu case, and the case is very complicated. The Third Branch of the High Court discovered this and conducted a rigorous investigation by Judge Sun on Saturday and Sunday. The secret investigation is still underway. As a result, it is still difficult to predict whether the Gu case can be announced as scheduled this afternoon. It is also heard that three guards have escaped from the prison and the court has issued arrest warrants.</p>
<h3>Fire on Rue Lokawei (Louxiangyuan Road) Claims the Lives of a Mother and Daughter</h3>
<p>In the city, at number 21, inside Yan Hai Lane, on Rue Lokawei (Louxiangyuan Road) in the Jiu Mu Di district, a tenant living above the Chen Tai Western Cigarette and Paper Store, a fire suddenly broke out at 8:50 AM yesterday. Due to the wind fanning the flames, the fire quickly spread through the roof and to number 23. The Second District Fire Brigade, upon learning of the incident, rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out at 10:10 AM. During the fire's peak, a woman named Jin Yu, 41 years old, from Anhui province, and her daughter Zhao Di, 8 years old, who lived upstairs, were informed too late.

<h3>Selling Old Weights and Measures Results in Fine and Probation</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new weights and measures system in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has also issued an order to comply with the system. However, the Health Department of the Municipal Council recently discovered that someone was selling old weights and measures that did not conform to the regulations in the Xiaoshadu Road Market. It dispatched a clerk named Shen to investigate the market. At 9:25 AM the day before yesterday, Zhang Sangen from Haimen was found selling a scale at the market. Shen purchased the scale from Zhang for 20 cents. After inspecting it, it was confirmed to be an old scale that violated the regulations. Shen then instructed Chinese Constable No. 942 to bring Zhang and 11 old scales to the Putuo Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted Zhang under Article 207 of the criminal law. After questioning by Judge Yang Qianchang, Zhang was sentenced to a fine of 30 yuan and two years of probation. This case is the first of its kind since the implementation of the weights and measures system in the International Settlement.</p>
<h3>Issuing Bad Checks Leads to Fine</h3>

The Great Shanghai and other companies hired lawyer Tong Yuwen to file a lawsuit against Yu and Chen in the First Special District Court on charges of fraud. Judge Zhan Liangce opened a trial. Yu never appeared, but Chen surrendered and responded to the lawsuit. The case has now concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan of the Fifth Criminal Court announced the verdict, sentencing Chen Qingyu to a fine of 400 yuan for issuing bad checks. The trial against Yu Chunlin was suspended.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Bus Route of the Zhabei Public Bus Returns to Baoshan Road Intersection as Its Starting Point</h3>
<p>The fourth and fifth bus routes of the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company used to start from the Baoshan Road intersection. The company, seeing that the two routes were largely the same, changed the starting point of the fifth bus route to the New Qiujiang Road intersection last winter to regulate traffic. However, after the change, the passengers along the route experienced inconvenience because the Qiujiang Road intersection may not have been suitable for traffic. Now, the company, adapting to the needs of passengers, has decided to return the fifth bus route to the Baoshan Road intersection as its starting point on the 12th of this month. The departure schedule will remain as originally planned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, at the request of the Jiaxing County Party Department and the County National Products Promotion Committee, nominated Chairman Lu Xingzhuang and Executive Committee member Xu Wenbin, among others, to visit He for site selection in preparation for holding a spring national products exhibition. It is learned that Lu and Xu traveled together on the 9th. After arriving in He, Huang Tongsheng, Zhu Zhenfan, Cao Tingrong, and others accompanied them to inspect the former site of the National Products Company at the Wang Wu Bridge. Because it is a four-story building with a small footprint, the manufacturers cannot gather in one place and must display their products on different floors, which seems inconvenient. Therefore, it is planned to still use the Mingyangmen Confucian Temple as the venue. The two gentlemen have now returned to Shanghai and plan to convene a meeting to ask the manufacturers to make a public decision.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshadu Road: Xu Xuedao's Home Burglarized</h3>

The robbers stole 60 yuan in legal tender, 12,000 copper coins, 2 long black cloth gowns, 1 woolen undershirt, and 1 pair of gold earrings before fleeing north towards Zhongshan Road without a trace. The victim reported the incident to the local Public Security Bureau, which is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Westerner's Houseboy Steals Master's Gun to Supply Robbers</h3>
<p>French police inspector Jiang Futian and detective Wang Rusong, along with detectives Liu Jinrong, Yang Zhongfang, and Shen Jinshu, inspected pedestrians on the morning of the 9th between Pisani Road and Route Crouck. They discovered three suspicious pedestrians: Zhang Fuxing (28 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 30, Lane Deyun, Xiexu Road), Wang Shaoshan (46 years old, from Anhui, residing in a hostel), and Wang Baoxing (22 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 36, Mei Baek Road).

It was found that the handgun belonged to Nantai (transliteration), a British employee of the North China Daily News residing at No. 32, Henry Road, who had a gun license number 372 issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. Wang Baoxing confessed that the gun belonged to the British man Nantai and was stolen by his houseboy, Qiang Linfa (21 years old, from Wuxi), to be used for robbery. Zhang and the two Wangs also admitted that they robbed the home of Dai Zihua at No. 37, Lane Tongfeng, No. 372, Xujiahui Road, on January 10th, obtaining over 300 yuan in loot. They were planning to rob the home of a Lou family at No. 11, Lane Sanyi, Baer Road, today when they were apprehended. The detectives arrested the houseboy Qiang Linfa. Yesterday morning, all were brought to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Wang Gangxu presided over the court. Yuan Jiahuan, a lawyer from the police department, presented the case and requested a two-week adjournment to conduct a detailed investigation before filing a suit for trial. The investigating detective reported the process of arresting the defendants and presented the handgun as evidence. The court examined the evidence and briefly questioned the defendants before adjourning the hearing to 9:00 AM on the 20th. The defendants were remanded into custody.</p>

After the crime was committed, the Hongkou Police Station's Chinese detective Wang Runhe arrested and brought Li to the First Special District Court, where he was detained pending trial. During the investigation, it was discovered that Li had also robbed clothing and silver dollars worth 137 yuan from Wei Youheng, a resident of No. 249, Xian Road, at 6:15 PM on January 25. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court.

<h3>Huiji Road: Crackdown on a Morphine Injection Den</h3>
<p>Huishan Police Station detective Ma Anxiang learned that someone was privately injecting morphine and profiting from opium addiction at No. 9, Lane 250, Huiji Road. At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, he secretly coordinated with Chinese and Western officers and went to the address to make an arrest. The ringleader, Chen Deng, escaped upon hearing the news. The accomplice, Qian Bing from Tongzhou, was arrested, along with drug users Zhang Jiuru, Liu Wensheng, Xu Zifa, Zhu Longbiao, Hu Hu, and a woman named Xu Zhu, as well as six syringes and 18 small packages of morphine. All were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First District Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu from the Shanghai Municipal Council explained the case and requested a trial. Detective Ma then reported the details of the arrest and presented the evidence for inspection. The defendants gave evasive testimony. Their arms and legs were covered in injection marks. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that they remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xiangsheng Addicted to Opium, Extorted by Female Servant and Accomplices: Accomplice Feng Ahui Recently Arrested, Rumor Has It That Zhu Xiangsheng Was Murdered Last Year</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiangsheng from Shaoxing, barely twenty years old, orphaned at a young age, inherited a considerable fortune from his late father. He lived a life of luxury and had an addiction to opium. He resided at No. 19, Lane 666, Tiantong Road, Hongkou. In October of the previous year, Zhu's female servant, Wen Fu, saw that her master was weak and easily bullied. She secretly colluded with five accomplices. On October 20 of that year, at 10:30 AM, they broke into the house, used threatening language to extort 2,000 yuan, and threatened to report him to the police for opium use if he refused. Zhu, under duress and unable to resist, issued a postdated check for 2,000 yuan from the Dingkang Qianzhuang on Tianjin Road. In addition to being monitored by the five robbers, Wen Fu went to the Dingkang Qianzhuang to cash the check. The money was divided among them. Afterwards, Zhu reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station. Detective Shang Wu arrested the suspect Xu Gang, who was sent to the First Special Court. Xu was found guilty and sentenced to three years of imprisonment. Xu confessed everything in court, stating that he and five accomplices, including Feng Ahui, each received 300 yuan, while Wen Fu alone received 500 yuan. The court issued arrest warrants for the remaining accomplices. It was discovered that Feng Ahui, originally from Huzhou, had been working as a bookkeeper at the Dehe Restaurant on Wuma Road. After the incident, he secretly returned to his hometown to avoid detection. Seeing that things had calmed down, he returned to Shanghai and began working as an inspector at the Grand Theatre on Jiujiang Road in March of this year. He thought he could escape justice, but Chief Inspector Wang Chengying discovered his background. He went to the Grand Theatre with a Western officer on the night of the 8th of this month,</p>
<p>arrested Feng Ahui, and took him to the Huishan Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law. Zhang stated that the defendant Feng Ahui had been identified by the convicted Xu Gang. He requested a postponement so that the police could bring Xu Gang from the Western Prison for questioning and confrontation. Moreover, the victim Zhu Xiangsheng was rumored to have been</p>
<p>assassinated outside a Yangjingbang Bund on June 12th of last year. This was confirmed and the police are investigating. Feng Ahui testified, "I knew Xu Gang when I was working as a bookkeeper at Dehe Restaurant. One day, I was walking along Beijing Road and met Xu and Li A'gen and five or six others. I asked them where they were going, and Li replied that they were going to Hongkou. I had since dispersed. I then went to a teahouse on Erma Road for a cup of tea. The next day, I met Li A'gen at the same teahouse. I then borrowed 30 yuan from Li. However, after Xu Gang was arrested, he falsely accused me in court</p>
<p>after reading the newspaper</p>
<p>of being an accomplice and receiving 300 yuan. That's when I knew that they had gone to Hongkou that day to do something dishonest. Because I was suspected of borrowing 30 yuan from Li A'gen, I had to return to my hometown to avoid detection. Actually, I knew nothing about this case at all." Judge Liu Yugui examined the testimony and ordered the defendant to remain in custody pending a further hearing this Friday.</p>

This year, 248 free tickets were issued to students, with 23,617 student visits. Notable events in the parks this year include the opening of Jiaozhou Park, which greatly benefited residents in the western district, as evidenced by the enthusiastic number of visitors. Also, a new area was added in the eastern district, located between Poyang, Guiyang, Tengyue, and Haizhou Roads, and is currently under construction, with a portion expected to open in 1936. Other notable park events are described below. (Zhaofeng Park) This year, Mrs. Aici Laifu donated a marble pavilion to the park. During the summer, the Municipal Council orchestra performed in the pavilion on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings. A thatched cottage was also added in the northern part of the park, and a rural-style kiosk was built in the music stage area. The park's appearance has been enhanced by the replanting of trees and flowers, making it more beautiful than before. The attached zoo was extremely crowded, with a large number of new birds and animals added and displayed this year. (Jiaozhou Park) The park officially opened on March 12, with the British military band performing, making it a grand occasion. Before the park opened, British children within the concession used the park to celebrate the 50th anniversary of King George V's ascension to the throne. In the six months since the park opened, the total number of visitors has reached over 55,500. The most popular area is the children's playground. Two grandstands have been added to the eastern part of the football field, accommodating a thousand people. This year, 54 football matches were held, with over 1,200 players participating. There were 39 baseball games, with over 700 participants. (Hongkou Park) The lake in the far north of the park, which was filled in last year, has been covered with grass this year, and shade trees have been planted around it, making it very comfortable for visitors. The main entrance has been renovated, and the side entrances have been enlarged to facilitate the exit of spectators after baseball and football games. Sports are very popular in this park. There are 80 grass tennis courts and 6 hard-surface tennis courts, all of which are crowded and insufficient. The golf, hockey, and baseball fields are also overcrowded.

In terms of sports, there are lawn bowling and tennis, with over 5,400 participants in lawn bowling and 2,700 in tennis this year. (Bund Garden) This place is always crowded with visitors in the spring, summer, and autumn, and this year is no different. The only improvement this year was the replacement of the grass kiosk near the entrance of the Baidu Bridge with a small garden scene, which is quite beautiful. (Other Parks) Zhoushan Park remains very popular, with nearly 130,000 visitors this year. Kunshan Garden and the children's playground, located in a densely populated area, are constantly visited. The children's playground on Nanyang Road, where children are led by adults, is also open year-round and is very popular with nearby residents.</p>

<h3>Pudong Farmer Chen Hongfu Was Murdered; Trial Opened Yesterday; Corpse's Wife Chen Huangshi and Others Strongly Suspected of Murder; Young Daughter Unintentionally Revealed the Case; Truth About to Come to Light</h3>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Yanjiujiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered on the night of November 21 last year and his body was abandoned on the Pudong beach. The next day, the head of the neighborhood reported it to the Procuratorate of the District Court. Prosecutor Li Fen arrived at the scene for examination and found that the corpse's wife, Chen Huangshi, showed no signs of grief. The police station took Chen Huangshi into custody and arrested Lu Ziliang, who was suspected of involvement. These events have been reported in previous newspapers. It has been learned that after Prosecutor Li Fen's thorough investigation, she has filed a public prosecution according to law.</p>
<p>The prosecution stated that Chen Huangshi was Chen Hongfu's wife, and Lu Ziliang was her maternal uncle. Chen Huangshi had a lover, and her husband's presence was inconvenient. Lu Ziliang had accumulated resentment because Chen Hongfu had sued him for robbery of rice in October last year (as documented in the case files). They conspired to commit murder. Late at night on November 21 last year, Lu Ziliang brought three unknown individuals to Chen Hongfu's house. Lu Ziliang held Chen Hongfu's</p>
<p>neck down</p>
<p>to prevent him from making noise. Chen Huangshi held down his feet, and the other three individuals repeatedly struck his chest with a bench, causing his ribs to break, leading to his death. Then, they jointly carried the body to the Yanjia Port beach, about half a mile from the house. The next day, the body was discovered and reported by the neighborhood chief. (Evidence and the applicable laws) The examination of Chen Hongfu's body revealed a wooden instrument injury near the right side of his chest, measuring one inch and four fen diagonally and six fen wide, purple-red in color, with blood clots. Pressing on the right rib revealed that the third rib was broken. There was a wooden instrument injury near the lower part of the left breast, measuring one inch and two fen diagonally and six fen wide, date-red in color, with blood clots. Pressing on the left rib revealed that the sixth rib was broken. There was an abrasion on the right rib, and</p>
<p>a rope mark on the throat,</p>
<p>only red, without damaging the skin. The back of the neck showed no marks. It was determined that he died due to the injuries sustained before death, and then the body was moved to the beach. An examination report is attached to the file. Although Chen Huangshi claimed that at 10:00 PM that night (November 21 last year), Chen Hongfu took his bedding to sleep on the boat to watch the rice, and she did not know how he was killed, the police investigation reported that neighbors in the vicinity, Zhang Qinglang and Yang the Blind, both said that one day Chen Hongfu's young daughter told Yang the Blind that her uncle (referring to Chen Hongfu's maternal uncle, Chen Ziliang)</p>
<p>brought three people</p>
<p>to hold down her father's throat, and her mother (Chen Huangshi) held his feet, and the other three people helped to beat him to death. Although Yang the Blind (Yang Furong) was unwilling to directly confess the situation, Zhang Qinglang testified that on the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month, Yang the Blind said to him that Chen Hongfu's third daughter, Xuezhen, came to Yang the Blind's house, and Yang the Blind asked her how her father died. Xuezhen said that her uncle brought three people, and her uncle held down her father's throat, and</p>
<p>my mother held down</p>
<p>my father's feet, and the other three people used a bench to beat my father's chest to death. Neighborhood chief Gao Linquan gave the same testimony, which is consistent with the injuries found in the examination. This testimony is credible. Zhang Qinglang also testified that Chen Huangshi did have a lover, who was a carpenter from Chongming, whose name he did not know. Also, after Chen Hongfu died, Chen Huangshi was not seen crying in grief, her eyes were not red or swollen, and she prevented the neighborhood chief from reporting the examination to the court, as testified by Gao Linquan. Based on the above evidence, it can be concluded that Chen Huangshi and Lu Ziliang are strongly suspected of</p>
<p>jointly murdering</p>
<p>Chen Hongfu and are guilty of the crime specified in Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the Thirteenth Tribunal to interrogate the second defendant, Lu Ziliang, and appointed lawyer Zhu Wenming to appear in court to defend him. After the judge took the stand, he ordered Chen Huangshi and Lu Ziliang, who were in custody, to be brought to the case. First, Chen Huangshi testified that she was 37 years old, from Chongming, living at No. 34 Yanjiujiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong. Her first husband worked on a sand boat,</p>
<p>and after her first husband died,</p>
<p>she remarried Chen Hongfu, and had six children, but two died prematurely. She now has four surviving children, three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, Genxiang, is eleven years old, the second son, Jinxiang, is eight years old, the daughter, Xuezhen, is six years old, and the fourth son, Xuexiang, is three years old. Her husband, Chen Hongfu, died on the 26th day of the tenth lunar month last year. When asked when he died, she replied in the first half of the night. The judge said, how do you know it was in the first half of the night? She replied that her husband borrowed a boat to carry rice home. After washing his feet, he took the quilt and went out again to</p>
<p>sleep on the boat.</p>
<p>That's why I said in the first half of the night. When asked when she found out, she replied that the next morning, someone came to ask for the borrowed boat. She went out and called, but did not see her husband. She then ordered her eldest son, Genxiang, to look for him, and only saw her husband's shoes and quilt left on the boat, but he was nowhere to be found. Then, someone at the ferry said that a body was found on the Pudong beach. She rushed to see it and it was indeed her husband. So she went to Zhoujiadu to report to her husband's brother, Chen Qiufu. When asked how far her house was from where the boat was moored, she replied, less than a mile. The judge said, the prosecutor</p>
<p>personally surveyed</p>
<p>and said it was only 20 zhang. She replied, it's more than half a mile. When asked if she said in the police station that her husband had nothing to do because he was stealing rice and was beaten to death, she replied, in the police station, they asked her what her husband had left beside him, and she said there was a bag of rice weighing more than 20 catties. When asked why she stopped the neighborhood chief from reporting the examination to the court, she replied that she did not say that. The judge said, the prosecutor accused you of murdering your husband, what do you say? She replied that this was not the case. When asked if she had a lover who was a carpenter, she replied, if</p>
<p>I had a lover,</p>
<p>why wouldn't I run away, why would I kill my husband? When asked if her children called Lu Ziliang uncle, she replied yes. When asked if her husband had enemies, she replied that he had many enemies. He had previously filed a lawsuit here. The judge ordered her to step down. Then Lu Ziliang was brought to the case and testified that he was 58 years old, from Chongming, living at No. 3 Yaojiazhai, Huasheng Road, Huade Road. He used to work at the power company. When asked why he had a lawsuit with Chen Hongfu, he replied that Chen Hongfu was his nephew. He owed him 13 dan of rice rent, and his wife asked for it, but he falsely accused his wife of robbing rice</p>
<p>and went to court.</p>
<p>The result was dismissed. When asked how Chen Hongfu died, he replied that he did not know and was unjustly accused. Then Gao Lian'gen, the son of the neighborhood chief Gao Linquan, testified that after the incident, Chen Huangshi did not want to report it. His father thought the case involved human life, and as the neighborhood chief, he had a responsibility, so he came to the court to report it. At that time, the police station sent detectives to investigate, but Chen Huangshi hid in Yang the Blind's house. Later, his mother called her out. Then the corpse's brother Chen Qiufu testified that his sister-in-law</p>
<p>was always well-behaved,</p>
<p>and he did not know who murdered his brother. Then the corpse's son Chen Genxiang testified that he was eleven years old. When asked how his father died, he replied that he did not know. When asked if it was in the first half of the night or the second half of the night, he replied in the first half of the night. When asked where he died, he replied by the Huangpu beach. When asked how he knew it was in the first half of the night, he replied that someone he did not know told him. When asked if it was his uncle who murdered him, he replied no. Chen Jinxiang testified that he was eight years old. When asked how his father died, he replied that he did not know. When asked if he died in the first half of the night or the second half of the night, he replied in the first half of the night. When asked how he knew it was in the first half of the night,</p>
<p>he hesitated.</p>
<p>When asked if his uncle came, he replied no. When asked if his father was murdered by his mother and uncle, he replied nonsense. When asked who taught him to say that, he replied he was not taught. Finally, the witnesses Zhang Qinglang and Yang the Blind testified. The judge said that the case still required further investigation of evidence and would be adjourned for further trial. He also ordered Chen Qiufu to bring the six-year-old daughter of the corpse, Chen Xuezhen, to court for questioning at the next hearing. Chen Huangshi and Lu Ziliang were returned to custody. By the time the court adjourned, it was already dusk.</p>

<h3>Selection of Famous Ancient and Modern Poems Published</h3>
<p>Poetry is flourishing in our country, and there is a wealth of writings. However, selectors have traditionally held narrow views, resulting in the fault of being too narrow. Those who boast of extensive collection result in the fault of being too indiscriminate. The recently published Selection of Famous Ancient and Modern Poems is able to correct these two faults. All works that have been widely circulated are included, starting from the Han and Wei dynasties to the late Qing and early Republic, totaling one thousand eight hundred poems. It explores the evolution of poetry and collects its essence, avoiding being too indiscriminate or too narrow. It is the most precise and insightful selection. The book was compiled and edited by Qu Kezhi from Changsha, Liu Linsheng from Lujiang, and Cai Zhenghua from Wuxing over three years. It was then reviewed by Xia Ying'an and others, and the Shanghai Commercial Press published it in four volumes. It includes annotations, making it most convenient for beginners. It is available for separate sale or as a set, either way is acceptable.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Claiming Award with Forged Lottery Ticket; Sun Baoxiang Found It by Accident; Suddenly Discovered During Prize Claim</h3>
<p>Sun Baoxiang, 24 years old, from Ningbo, works as a shop assistant at Liji Fish Shop, No. 33 Tongxing Lane, Xiaocaichang Road, Simalu. On the evening of the 7th of this month, he accidentally found three Phase 19 Aviation Lottery tickets on the street. The next day, he examined the lottery tickets in detail and found that the number of one of the tickets, "217056," matched the fourth prize number drawn on the "7th" of the following day. He did not check its authenticity and was overjoyed. On the morning of the "9th" two days prior, Sun took the ticket to Wang Quanchang Tobacco and Paper Store, No. 235, opposite the Old North Gate on the Minguo Road in the French Concession, to check and exchange for the prize money. The shop assistant carefully examined the lottery ticket and found that the last character was "Seven," and the "Six" was cut and pasted from another ticket. Suspecting Sun of forgery, the shop assistant detained Sun and notified the police, who brought Sun and the lottery ticket to the French Police Station. Yesterday at noon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court. Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the interrogation.

<p>Shanghai Basketball Association: Mailing Barely Defeats Datong</p>
<p>The Pirates Meet Mailing Tonight</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Basketball Association's A Division, Datong faced Mailing. Both teams have been victorious in every battle since their debut. This was a decisive meeting, and whoever won would secure the right to the final. Therefore, the athletes on both sides were energetic and cautious in this important moment. The overall atmosphere was tense, and the score was tied five times. Because Mailing's players were tall and had long arms, they ultimately won with a score of 47 to 38. At the beginning of the match, Datong went all out, and Wang Weixi and Chen Wen'e scored one after another, leading with a score of 4 to 0. Then, Mailing's Luther and Cliffen scored three consecutive goals, taking the lead. In a short while, Wang, Cheng, and Xu each contributed, taking the lead again with a score of 10 to 6. However, Mailing came from behind again, taking the lead with a score of 12 to 10. Wang Weixi made one shot and one free throw, exceeding the score for the third time with 13 to 12, marking Datong's golden age. After that, Mailing took the lead, and Datong's victory was like a fleeting moment. At halftime, Mailing had 23 points, and Datong had 18.</p>
<p>In the second half, Mailing's momentum remained strong, while Datong's performance was also excellent. They once closed the gap to 33 to 35, only one point behind. Later in the competition, both sides became more intense, and the scores increased. When time ran out, Mailing barely won with a score of 47 to 38. The results of the two teams are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results:</p>
<p>Mailing Defeats Datong: 47 to 38</p>

<p>The Location of the 19th North China Games:</p>
<p>Shaanxi and Qingdao Authorities Are Unwilling to Host</p>
<p>The Beijing Stadium Has Not Yet Begun Construction</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Since the Beiping Municipal Government declined to host the 19th North China Games, preparations have been underway for half a year, but there is still no venue. When the North China Sports Association held the 6th National Games in Shanghai last year, the standing committee members from various provinces in North China gathered to discuss the matter and decided to hold the games in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, so that athletes in the interior could understand the situation in the Northwest. If that was not possible, the games would be postponed to Qingdao. Subsequently, Dong Shouyi, a standing committee member of the North China Sports Association, contacted the Shaanxi authorities in a private capacity. However, Shaanxi Province, due to years of natural disasters and man-made calamities, poverty and financial exhaustion, was unable to host. Qingdao was also unwilling to host. As the situation in North China changed and the situation became uncertain, the North China Sports Association had no time to take care of the matter. The reporter specially inquired with Dong Shouyi, a standing committee member of the North China Sports Federation, who said that the issue of the location for the 19th North China Games has not been discussed recently. However, when both Shaanxi and Qingdao are unable to host, the games will be postponed to other provinces and cities. As for which provinces and cities will be considered, the decision will be made at the meeting. It is still uncertain whether the games can be held this year (i.e., the 25th year). It was previously rumored that the 19th North China Games would be held in Beiping after the completion of the public stadium. However, although the drawings for the public stadium have been completed, the Sports Commission had previously decided to purchase materials at the end of the 24th year and start construction this spring. However, this was only a proposal and has not been implemented. According to Li Zhou, a sports supervisor at the Social Affairs Bureau, a meeting of key sports personnel is still needed to review the drawings, purchase materials, and begin construction. It is too early to talk about it, so the construction of the public stadium remains unresolved, and the North China Games in Beiping are absolutely hopeless.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Medical Journal: The Urgent Need to Promote Rural Nurses (Part 1) by Yin Jinquan</p>
<p>Since ancient times, China has been an agricultural country. More than 85% of the population are farmers, so the rural problem in China is the problem of the entire country. The attention of the general public has shifted to the issue of rural revitalization. Many politicians, educators, and various experts studying rural problems in China have researched and believe that Chinese farmers have four major diseases: "poverty," "ignorance," "selfishness," and "weakness." Therefore, the Hebei Dingxian Civilian Education Promotion Association, in order to save these four major diseases, has formulated four major education guidelines: production education to cure "poverty," civilian education to cure "ignorance," civic education to cure "selfishness," and public health to cure "weakness." However, in order to restore the countryside, although it depends on the progress of all parties, the most important thing is the issue of health. Poor rural health in China is the main reason for China's poverty and weakness, so promoting rural health is an urgent task for China, which is an undeniable fact. In order to manage rural health, we must turn our attention to the living conditions of farmers and the situation of rural society. The author will describe the facts seen with his own eyes in the following four points:</p>
<p>The knowledge of farmers is extremely shallow. They have no knowledge of recent learning. Therefore, they do not expect to enjoy any new medicine or hygiene. They do not understand the so-called dietary hygiene at all. Raw water is their temporary drink to quench their thirst. Although food is about to rot after ten or eight days, they cannot bear to throw it away, otherwise they may offend God. Therefore, diseases easily come to them. After encountering the disease, they rely on the copper tendons and iron bones they have cultivated through hard work to support themselves and fight against the disease. Without proper medical treatment, minor illnesses can be cured naturally after suffering some pain. Serious illnesses can only be endured with full of grief and indignation, waiting for the arrival of death. Or they panic and seek gods and ask for divination in the east, and visit immortal pills and magical remedies in the west, spending a lot of money until they die without understanding, thinking that life is like this. How pitiful is this kind of injustice.</p>
<p>The most diligent are the farmers, and the most painful are also the farmers. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made calamities have led to people's inability to make a living. It is difficult to take care of life, let alone hygiene. If you do not work, you cannot survive, so many people work while sick. If you step into the realm of the countryside, you can see people with yellow faces and thin bodies everywhere, still working like cattle and horses all day long. The efficiency of work cannot be increased, production will naturally decrease, and life will gradually become difficult. This is a matter of course. How can they enjoy modern aristocratic hospital treatment when they are sick?</p>
<p>China has 400 million people, and the number of doctors needed is naturally very large. However, according to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Health, there are less than 4,000 qualified doctors. Moreover, most of these few doctors are concentrated in cities, and they are rarely seen in rural areas. This is a畸形 development of the medical community in China. Hospitals in rural areas are even rarer. Therefore, even if there are people in rural areas who know about new medicine, they cannot get it. Therefore, when encountering diseases, they cannot get the protection of new medicine. If they go to the city for treatment, it is inconvenient to travel, but they cannot afford the expensive medical expenses, let alone ask a doctor to come to their home for examination. Therefore, when they get sick, they have no choice but to ask for mysterious doctors or seek gods and ask for divination.</p>
<p>Farmers do not understand hygiene and do not have hygiene guarantee facilities. When encountering infectious diseases, they do not know the method of isolation. They will inevitably spread widely, causing a terrible tragedy for the farmers in the whole village, poisoning the majority of the people. If a case of tiger plague occurs, many productive farmers will die. If a case of smallpox occurs, countless precious small farmers will be injured. The fear of tigers is a very obvious example. The number of deaths in the hands of ignorant midwives is even more unknown.</p>
<p>The rural health situation and the suffering of farmers' lives are as described above. How can we bear to delay the management of rural health? From various aspects, managing rural health is the most urgent issue for rural revitalization, and it is an urgent task for the country. There is no denying it.</p>
<p>The Words of Color Blindness by Guo Bolin</p>
<p>The Abnormalities of Color Blindness</p>
<p>When we want to see a certain color, we must have a certain degree of light. The reason is that if the light is not sufficient, the hue will change. For example, red is the most difficult to recognize at dusk. In bright places, red is brighter than blue, but in dark places, red is darker.</p>
<p>In this way, among ordinary people, there are also physiological patients, but if the light is sufficient, but they still cannot distinguish red from green or gray, so they recognize green leaves as red leaves, or recognize red leaves as green leaves, or see unripe fruits as ripe, see ripe fruits as unripe, and even cannot distinguish blue from yellow, it is obvious that there is an abnormality in color vision.</p>
<p>If it is congenital color blindness, because there are no other eye symptoms and does not hinder daily life, most of them are determined only after being examined in a state of other awareness.</p>
<p>Types of Color Vision Abnormalities</p>
<p>Among the color vision abnormalities, there are color blindness and color weakness. Among color blindness, there are—</p>
<p>1. Those who cannot distinguish red from green and gray</p>
<p>2. Those who cannot recognize blue and yellow</p>
<p>3. Those who cannot distinguish colors at all</p>
<p>etc.; and in the middle, there are congenital and acquired types.</p>
<p>Congenital Color Blindness</p>
<p>The so-called congenital color blindness is inherited from parents. Among them, there are;</p>
<p>Those who are completely color blind due to consanguineous marriage of parents. The so-called complete color blindness means that when looking at the outside world, it is like we are looking at a photograph, and we can only feel light and dark and shades. For example, blue is bright, red is dim, and vision is also weak, and we cannot see far away. There is photophobia in bright places, and we must squint to see things. There is also nystagmus.</p>
<p>When one or both parents have color blindness, or have latent color blindness factors, their children will definitely have color blindness.</p>
<p>Among the color blindness at this time, red-green color blindness is the most frequent, and there are five ways to appear.</p>
<p>(1) Children born to a color-blind father and a healthy mother, whether male or female, will not have color blindness, but all daughters will not be spared the latent color blindness factor.</p>
<p>(2) Children born to a mother with latent color blindness inheritance and a healthy father, half of the sons will have color blindness, and although all daughters have no abnormalities, half of them have latent hereditary color blindness.</p>
<p>(3) Children born to a mother with latent color blindness inheritance and a father with color blindness, half of the sons have color blindness, and the daughters have no color blindness on the surface, but they are latent.</p>
<p>(4) Children born to a color-blind mother and a healthy father, all sons have color blindness, and the daughters are completely healthy on the surface, but they are completely latent with color blindness factors.</p>
<p>(5) Children born to a color-blind mother and a color-blind father are completely color blind, whether male or female.</p>
<p>The Number of Color Blind Patients</p>
<p>As shown above, there are relatively few women with color blindness, less than one-tenth of that of men. Among men, 4.5% have color blindness, that is, one in every 22 or 23 people. The reason why there are fewer women with color blindness than men is not that the hereditary ability of color blindness is weak for women, but that it appears on the outside on one side and is latent on the inside on the other side.</p>
<p>Acquired Color Blindness (Color Weakness)</p>
<p>There are cases where it is not congenital heredity, but it is extremely difficult to distinguish colors due to certain reasons. This is the so-called acquired color blindness, also known as color weakness. Although the symptoms are not as severe as congenital color blindness, it is always quite slow to distinguish colors.</p>
<p>The part in the eyeball that controls color vision is the retina on the back wall of the eyeball. Among this retina, the central part is the most sensitive to color. Therefore, if there is a disease that invades the retina, especially the central part, or if you have other diseases such as optic nerve disease, the color field of vision will be reduced or disappear, resulting in difficulty in distinguishing colors, or even inability to recognize them.</p>
<p>Types, Causes and Treatment</p>
<p>Among those who cannot distinguish red from green, there are optic nerve diseases: such as beriberi, optic neuritis, congested papilla, optic nerve atrophy, etc.</p>
<p>Diseases that cannot recognize blue and yellow are caused by diseases of the retina choroid. For example, retinitis choroiditis or retinal choroid atrophy, etc.</p>
<p>Acquired color weakness is to concentrate on treating the original disease that induces the disease is the most important thing, but the so-called congenital color blindness treatment based on heredity has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>For color blind patients, for colors, such as red, green, or yellow, although they are all regarded as gray, they can actually recognize light and dark and shades, so if according to the guidance of non-color blind people that this is red and that is green, or according to its shade to distinguish it as a certain color, it is possible to recognize it to a certain extent after practicing in this way. In short, as mentioned earlier, one in every 22 or 23 men has color blindness, and one in every 220 or 230 women has color blindness, and this disease is not limited to heredity. There are also cases of acquired color blindness caused by diseases such as beriberi and retinitis, so if a patient has color blindness, they must first explore the cause and then quickly implement appropriate and effective treatment.</p>
<p>New Treatment for Leucorrhea by Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>R. Koelsch of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Famous University of Heidelberg in Germany found Trichomonas in 74 of 150 gynecological patients and used it as the cause of leucorrhea, although there are still disputes about whether it is a unique pathogen. However, as a result of the disappearance of Glykogem in the vaginal wall due to the existence of Trichomonas, the survival of the normal vaginal flora is adversely affected, and the resistance of the tissue is also destroyed at the same time, which makes it easy for pathogens to infect. Opening the door to convenience has become an indisputable fact.</p>
<p>The most suitable method for proving Trichomonas is to carry it out in the dark field. In this method, use a platinum loop to take a small amount of secretions from the vaginal wall. Mix it with a drop of saline solution on an ordinary object glass. And check it according to the ordinary inspection method. Trichomonas can be seen moving freely with flagella. Shaped like a pear. Its size is slightly larger than white blood cells or moves individually between epithelial blocks. Or gather into a piece.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Trichomonas vaginitis. Is that this vaginitis cannot be completely cured without specific treatment. That is, the usual washing therapy with drugs. Silver bath, white pottery drying therapy, whole body strengthening therapy, stimulation therapy, whether used alone or in combination. Those who are absolutely unable to completely cure Trichomonas vaginitis. At most, there are only three or four days of relief. The vaginitis will still recur.</p>
<p>Gelhorn used the blowing method of 「 」 to get amazing results. Koelsch used</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>The new leucorrhea treatment drug Devegan has achieved good results. Because the effective component 4 in its active ingredient Okin 3 Acethnyl Amynophenilorgenic acid is a primitive toxin that can kill Trichomonas. And it helps the vaginal wall to eliminate Glykagen. Therefore, after inserting three Devegan tablets each time, Trichomonas in severe leucorrhea cannot be found again and white blood cells have almost completely disappeared. The vaginal flora is also tending to be in good condition. After five or six treatments. Generally, only epithelial cells and bacilli can be seen.</p>
<p>After using Devegan. Very clean, there is absolutely no unpleasant drawback of forming lumps after using other drying therapies.</p>
<p>The use of Devegan. In the first three or four days. Insert three or four tablets every day. There is no need to wash the local area or wipe it with cotton before inserting.</p>
<p>And in the dark field. When Trichomonas is no longer present. Then patients can be allowed to treat themselves. Each time insert one or two Devegan tablets deep into the vagina. There is absolutely no need to wash. Even the patient himself feels that washing is unnecessary. Because the vaginal secretions have disappeared.</p>
<p>Patients cured in this way are generally no longer prone to vaginitis. However, it is necessary to re-examine after menstruation because Trichamso often has a tendency to recur at this time.</p>
<p>Common Sense Questions and Answers About Diseases by Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(78) Edema and Hunger Edema</p>
<p>Q: What is edema?</p>
<p>A: Edema is the swelling caused by the accumulation of water under the skin of the whole body. It is mostly a symptom of kidney disease; therefore, if you encounter edema, you must first check the urine.</p>
<p>Q: Why do people with kidney disease always develop edema?</p>
<p>A: The formation of edema is nothing more than: water retention in the body, changes in the walls of blood vessels, and disorders of salt metabolism. When there is kidney disease, these three functions are abnormal, so edema occurs.</p>
<p>Q: How does water get retained in the body?</p>
<p>A: The excretion of water in the normal body is mainly managed by the kidneys. If the kidney's ability to excrete water is reduced, water will accumulate under the skin, and then edema will occur. At this time, the amount of urine is extremely reduced, or even no urine.</p>
<p>Q: How do blood vessel walls change?</p>
<p>A: Because the blood vessel walls are damaged, their ability to permeate water suddenly increases. As a result, plasma in the blood seeps out into the tissues outside the blood vessels and remains there.</p>
<p>Q: How does salt metabolism disorder cause water to stay?</p>
<p>A: With kidney disease, the excretion of salt is very difficult. As a result, salt stays in the tissues, and salt has the property of attracting water, so it can cause water to stay.</p>
<p>Q: What are the clinical characteristics of edema in kidney disease?</p>
<p>A: Clinically, edema in kidney disease is manifested as: skin edema, starting with edema on the face, especially around the eyes and cheeks, and pale skin; then edema on the lower limbs, upper limbs, and finally the whole body. Accumulation of water in the body cavity, that is, ascites and pleural effusion. Mucosal edema, such as edema of the conjunctiva, palate, and glottis. Visceral edema. This is the most dangerous time.</p>
<p>Q: How to treat it?</p>
<p>A: It is advisable to treat kidney disease first.</p>
<p>Q: What is hunger edema?</p>
<p>A: This is edema caused by poor nutrition and insufficient food in the body for a while. During the World War, soldiers developed this disease.</p>
<p>Q: Which types of people are prone to this hunger edema?</p>
<p>A: Prisoners in prisons, laborers in big cities, and farmers in famine years all have the experience of developing this disease.</p>
<p>Q: What is the cause of this disease?</p>
<p>A: The cause of this disease is mainly malnutrition, especially lack of fat and protein, excessive intake of water and salt; vitamin deficiency. The key is that the calcium content in the body is reduced and the endocrine function is reduced, resulting in an imbalance in water excretion.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>A: Edema suddenly occurs in the limbs and trunk, the pulse is slow, and the blood pressure drops. But there is no change in the urine, no protein, and the urine volume increases, which is completely different from the edema in kidney disease.</p>
<p>Q: How to treat hunger?</p>
<p>A: Give foods rich in vitamins, improve diet, and the edema will be removed quickly. (End)</p>

<p>(77) The Relationship Between Syphilis and Eye Diseases</p>
<p>Syphilis is one of the three major venereal diseases. It is also a contagious disease that is generally recognized as the most rapidly spreading and dangerous in society. The more civilized the country. The more prosperous the city. The more opportunities it has to spread. Just look at Shanghai. You can see the general situation. The danger of syphilis. Not only is it limited to individuals. Moreover, it can affect wives and children. Affect society. Therefore, syphilis has a great impact on the hygiene of individuals, families, and society. Its virus. In addition to the initial hard nodules that occur locally. It can also spread throughout the body and limbs. Therefore, there are special clinical manifestations of skin syphilis, hair and nail syphilis, mucous membrane syphilis, airway syphilis, visceral syphilis, urinary syphilis, genital syphilis, periosteal and bone syphilis, joint syphilis, fascia and muscle syphilis, nervous system syphilis, and visual and auditory syphilis, etc. Mild cases are painful and unbearable. Severe cases can cause damage, disability. Even lose your life. As for the detailed condition. There are already expert works. I will not go into details. Now I will briefly describe the eye diseases caused by syphilis.</p>
<p>Eye diseases can occur from the initial stage of syphilis to the third stage of syphilis. It can also occur in congenital syphilis (see table below). Generally, the age of onset is mostly between 20 and 40 years old. The symptoms of eye diseases caused by syphilis are mostly severe. And there are more dangers. Patients feel photophobia, tearing, pain, vision impairment, and conjunctival congestion. The cornea develops peripheral congestion, turbidity, and neovascularization. In severe cases, it can cause fundus changes. At this time, vision impairment often increases. Many people also become blind because of this. Its statistics. The rate of blindness due to syphilis is about 15%. In addition, there are headaches, fatigue, and aches and pains in the limbs. It can also cause fever and chills.</p>
<p>The sites where syphilitic eye diseases are prone to occur. The cornea and iris are the most common. Followed by the uvea and optic nerve.</p>
<p>The prevention method for syphilitic eye diseases. Is to prevent the invasion of syphilis. If you have syphilis. Or it is congenital syphilis. Then you should immediately undergo anti-syphilis treatment. If there is suspicion of causing syphilitic eye disease. At the same time, eye diseases should be treated.</p>
<p>(Attached) Eye diseases caused by various stages of syphilis. The list is on the right.</p>
<p>Congenital Syphilis: Interstitial keratitis, retinochoroiditis, and optic nerve atrophy.</p>
<p>Primary Syphilis: Hard chancre of the eyelids or conjunctiva.</p>
<p>Secondary Syphilis: Iritis, chorioretinitis, vitreous opacity, and optic nerve recurrence.</p>

<p>Dental Knowledge Questions and Answers (19) by Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Chapter 5 The Relationship Between Dental Diseases and Health</p>
<p>(Note) The following two questions that were missing in the previous issue are now added:</p>
<p>(Question 96) Can most dental diseases cause tooth loss?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. As mentioned in Chapter 4 above, common dental diseases are nothing more than two types: tooth decay and pyorrhea. If tooth decay is not treated early and allowed to progress, it often leads to periodontitis and loss of teeth. Even if it is not lost, it will eventually be so decayed that it is incomplete, and most of the crown part will be eroded and will no longer be a tooth. Speaking of pyorrhea, if it is not cured, it can cause the loss of all the teeth in the mouth.</p>
<p>(Question 97) What are the effects of incomplete teeth in the mouth? The biggest disadvantage is that it reduces the chewing function and hinders food digestion. In Chapter 1 above, the function of teeth, the importance of oral digestion, and the benefits of fine chewing have already been explained. If all the teeth are missing, or they are decayed and incomplete, no matter how much you chew, you will not be able to chew finely, let alone that many people are unwilling to chew more? As a result, digestion is insufficient, the stomach and intestines will definitely be burdened, digestion will definitely be inferior, and nutrition will definitely be poor. Nutrition is the basis of health, so how can a person with poor nutrition be healthy?</p>
<p>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (81) by Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 6 Specialized Stimulus Treatment - Tuberculin</p>
<p>Hemoptysis: Hemoptysis is one of the important symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, and it occurs in many patients. For patients with this symptom, the first thing to do is to try to comfort them and not panic too much. It must be known that hemoptysis is not necessarily the most dangerous symptom of this disease, and the number of patients who are directly endangered by life because of this is not very large; conversely, patients with this disease who have not had hemoptysis are not necessarily optimistic; doctors should explain this truth clearly to the patient without being annoyed. Secondly, the patient must be absolutely quiet, with an ice pack placed on the chest, and hot food is prohibited; if hemoptysis has stopped, the patient must lie down for at least eight days before leaving the bed. Finally, symptomatic drug treatment is given. Because relying solely on drugs and neglecting the patient's rest is difficult to be effective. The most common method in terms of drugs to be used is the oral salt soup method, which is an old folk prescription, but it is very in line with the treatment principle. Intravenous injection of salt solution is faster than oral administration. In addition, calcium preparations, camphor preparations, donkey-hide gelatin, and all other old and new blood-clotting preparations can be used. These various things can probably be done both orally and by injection; as for the effectiveness aspect, of course injection is faster than oral administration; therefore, doctors use it relatively more.</p>
<p>Poor appetite: This is very common among patients with this disease; some people even completely judge the prognosis of the disease based on the patient's appetite. This point of view is of course not very correct, but it can also be seen how important this symptom is! Regarding the symptomatic drugs here, such as the calcium preparations and wood creosote preparations mentioned above, are very suitable: patients mostly have their appetite increased because of this. Other various stimulus treatments are also helpful. In addition, gastric juice, dilute hydrochloric acid, and various stomachics can also be used as much as possible; when there is too much gastric acid, alkaline preparations and aluminum preparations are appropriate.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education to Restrict Enrollment Fees Charged by Schools at All Levels</h3>
<p>Domestic schools at all levels charge enrollment fees when recruiting new students. Except for Hubei Province, which stipulates that middle schools can charge a maximum of 5 jiao, which is considered good and worth referencing, most middle schools charge 1 yuan, with some charging as much as 1.5 yuan. (Nanjing) universities charge even more, with some charging as much as 3 yuan. In (Beiping), slightly renowned schools hold several recruitment examinations each time they enroll new students. The statistics for new student applications range from a minimum of over 1,000 to a maximum of several thousand. The income from these fees is usually around 1,000 yuan, with some earning as much as 8,000 to 9,000 yuan (Beiping). The expenses, besides using it to treat teachers with ice cream and watermelon (since most recruitment is during the summer), include giving each student two pieces of bread, or sometimes not even bread. This is not the way of education. Recently, the Educational Research Association of a certain Party department in Zhejiang, aware of the malpractices of schools charging new student enrollment fees, specifically requested the Ministry of Education to promulgate measures to restrict them. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education has stipulated restrictive measures regarding the charging of enrollment fees by schools at all levels and will issue a notice to schools nationwide to comply with them.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Boy (1)(7)(3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Thinking of another father who left his children last night and will never return, Mr. Pei tightly hugged his own children, burying his face in Robert's curly hair for quite some time. Emily rested her head on his arm, and Franz rested his head on his uncle's shoulder. His childlike face even turned pale with sympathy and melancholy. The others just sat there, silently. For a moment, there was only silence in the room, so the sound of leaves falling outside could be clearly heard.</p>
<p>Robert didn't understand what was going on, but he saw that his father was unhappy, so he raised his lowered head and said in his small bird-like voice, mixed with German dialect:</p>
<p>"Don't cry; Mein Vater! We are all good, even if you are not there, we did our homework, and Franz is the old teacher." (Note)</p>
<p>Mr. Pei then looked up, forced a smile, and said with grateful emotion, "I really thank you, my children. It is wonderful that you help me and comfort me so much. I tell you, I will never forget it." Hearing this, the children felt like they were saints.</p>
<p>Nade said, "Franz started it, and he is a first-rate teacher." Others nodded in agreement, which made the little teacher feel very pleased.</p>
<p>(Note) Mein Vater: German for "My Father."</p>

<h3>World Games Football Preliminary Round to Be Held in Hong Kong; Candidate Number Set at Thirty</h3>
<p>There are five selection committee members participating in the World Games football preliminary round. Besides Hao Gengsheng in Beijing and Yan Chengkun in Guangdong, the remaining three members, Shen Siliang, Ma Yuehan, and Rong Qizhao, met and discussed once last month and decided to nominate thirty candidate players. Preliminary selection competitions are scheduled to be held in Hong Kong in early April to eliminate eight players. According to a recent statement by Shen Siliang to reporters, this plan has not yet been formally decided, as it is still seeking the opinions of Hao Gengsheng and Yan ZhaoKun. Once Hao and Yan agree, the plan can be implemented accordingly. Otherwise, a more appropriate plan will be discussed separately.</p>
