<h3 id="c80">中國地理之統一 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 中國大學敎授　張其昀</p>
<p>民國成立以來，中國地理學已經有顯著的進步，與許多新奇可喜的成績。各方面的貢獻却有一共同歸束之點，就是都可證明我們祖國是位於完整的大陸而保持統一的形勢。現在我們要擁護國家主權，反對領土分裂，不僅是民族意識的偉大情感，也是學理研究當然的結論。現在試就人文地理。生物地理與地文學三方面，各舉主要事實以資說明。</p>
<p>在人文地理方面來看，中國的語言是統一的，中國雖有種種方言存在，但各方言的文法，在句子的結構上，差不多是全國一樣，像官話和吳語「你到那裹去」？跟福建廣東語「你去那裹」？這種小小的差別巳經是例外的了。趙元任先生說：「講中國方言的文法，差不多就是講語助詞」。（註一）中國方言用語助詞來表示口氣的輕重及信疑的態度等，各處用法不同，甚為複雜。而中國的文言則有全國一致的性質，共語助詞在歷史上很少變遷。三千多年以來，國文實在是中國民族的天然團結力，不但古人的情操留傳於後人，且藉以維繫全中國的人心。這裹所謂國文，當然指文言和文學的國語二者而言。</p>
<p>中國民族以漢族為基本，漢族是一個文化的名辭，即包括有史以來已經同化的大民族。現在邊疆各省區尙有少數非漢族，他們講的是非漢語，他們文化較低，沒有學過國文。但無論漢語或非漢語，都屬於同一語言系統。以中國本部為中心，南至馬來半島。西包西藏緬甸，東渡海而達台灣，北越沙漢至西伯利亞葉尼塞河上游，此區域內人民所操的語言皆屬於單節語族（Monosyllable）。其中大致分為漢語，暹台語·西藏語·緬甸語四系，若再合併一下，漢語與暹暹有關，西藏與緬甸為近，語言學家稱為漢台藏緬語系（Thai-Chinese，Tibeto-Burmese），或簡稱為漢藏系。例如猓猓（即玀玀）語為藏緬語之一支，據丁文江先生研究，採祼文字根本與漢文同源，如吾定詞為Ma，部落為部Pu，漢猓二文至今相同（註二）漢藏語系，又稱震且語系，就是中國語系，它有下列三個特點：　一字一音，即所謂單節語；　無語尾變化，所謂孤立語；　有平上去入等各聲之別，此三特點皆為中國語系所有。日本語則屬於添加語（Agglutinative），字與字中間須添加許多語助詞，方能構成全體之意義，與中國語不同。</p>
<p>安陽的殷墟發掘為近年中國學術上之一大事，所得地下史料極可寳貴。據李濟先生報吿，商朝末年的銅器所含之錫多在百分之十以上，已經到了靑銅時代。銅錫原料大抵靠賴南方供給，甲骨文不但有麥字，叉有米字，掘出來的獸骨有水牛遺骸，稻米與水牛都是南方的成分。當時又用海產貝類作為貨幣。李先生說，殷民族能採南國之金，捕東海之鯨，遊獵於大河南北，而從事於征伐文字禮樂等事，全東亞沒有最與抗衡的，不是一件偶然的事。（註三）足見中國之所以能偉大，在於自始耶能綜合南北之所長。叉王國維先生研究股墟下辭中的地名，其結論謂今河北省淶易之間，尙為商代邦畿之地，而其制度文物全與商同。觀於周初箕子之封，成王肅愼之命，知商之聲靈固遠及東北。（註四）東亞的三大半島，山東半島遼東半島和朝鮮牛島，在三千年前早已合為一家，紙上的舊史料和地下的新史料，都可以確實證明無疑的。</p>
<p>中國的植物和中國民族一樣，內容異常豐富，即由於許多植物區域的種類匯合而成。在中國北部有西伯利亞的分子，在西部有喜馬拉雅的分子，在南部有馬來半島的分子。中國原是一塊茫茫大陸，中間並無大海使其隔離，故各植物區的分子多能互相雜糅，北方的種類往往分布於南方各省，南方的種類有時亦能分布於較高的緯度。（註五）因為植物種類的繁多，而土壤氣候叉極佳良，故經濟植物異常繁盛，穀菽果品工業用植物與花卉等，多發源於中國，歐洲庭園觀賞植物取材於中國者極多。我國植物不僅科學上饒有興趣，在經濟上允有特殊之價値。試舉大豆為例，現在世界市塲上的大豆幾完全為中國之東三省輸出，關內各省種植大豆可認為專供自用，而關外農民則以出口為其主要目的。大豆即黃豆，西文名為Soybean，Soy即菽豆之菽，廣雅云：「大豆，菽也」。蓋菽字本為大豆的轉注，今己成為世界的通稱。我國栽培大豆甚早，左傳記菽麥之辨，劉安有豆腐之製，斑斑可考。豆腐曾有人稱為國菜，此外如豆乳，豆芽，豆油，豆餅，豆醬，醬油等，代有發明，均為黃豆之改製品。假使我們要指出一宗國產，來代表中國的天富，第一要能普遍於全國，若長城以北之寒，嶺南一帶之熱，都能見到的；第二要能流傳於民間，即三家村之孤陋，亦可有每飯不忘的價値；第三又要有世界的意義或國際的聲譽，那末名聞世界的東三省大豆，便是中國地理統一性最好的象徵。</p>
<p>近年地文學方面有一重大發明，就是翁文灝先生發明的燕山期造山運動。地殼上的山脈各有其生成的時代及歷史，從歐洲地質研究的結果，通常所認為造山時代者，計有數期，允以中生代中期之克利多寗（Caledonian），古生代末期之海西寗（Hercynian），第三紀中期之阿耳賓（Alplne）三期，最為重要。歐洲學者以為世界山脈之生成，大抵不外乎此，如亞洲之喜馬拉引（Himalayan）期即相常於阿耳賓期。民國成立以來中國地質學界之努力，於中國山脈詳加研究，始恍然而知中國地質自有特殊規模，不必與人盡同。中生代下半期實為中國大部分造山所及火成岩活動最烈之時代，謂之海西寗已太遲，謂之喜馬拉引尙太早。此主要造山期之分布及其證明，首山翁先生綜括歷年調查結果，詳為推斷，創一新名，稱之為燕山期造山作用。蓋此造山期在亞歐火陸上向未注意，而最初發現的證據，實多得之於河北省的燕山山脈。然繼續研究之結果，始知北至吉黑，南至雲貴，實均受其影響。民國十七年太平洋科學會議在日本東京開會，翁先生宣讀此項論文，科學雜誌地質　報均有其論文發表（註六）這一點幾經研究已達確定之域。於是所謂燕山期者不但成為亞洲東部最重要的造山期，而中國大陸為一整個構造，亦巳為世界學者所公認。自燕山運動以後，中國北部有一大沈降地帶出現，名為渤海火內斜（Geasyncline）這就是現在渤海的前身。在遠古的時候，渤海比現在大得多，只因為大自然的作用，彷彿是『愚公移山，精衛塡海』，居然在渤海周圍造成偉大的冲積平原，這些平原在地質上都應歸入大內斜的範圍。渤海大內斜包括三部分，即　遼河半原，　渤海本身，　華北平原。現在所謂關內與關外，不但在經濟上有極密切的關係，在地文上本來也是一個單位。又遼柬和山東二大半島，當初本是相連，登州海峽乃是後起的。到新生代的後半期，東面的遼魯大陸，發生斷層作用，登州海峽因此出現，海水侵入遂成渤海。東北二大半島，雖被登州海峽隔開了，但共地質構造和岩石性質都很相似。總之，渤海完全是中國的內海，渤海周圍的土地天然是中國的版圖，凡是矯揉造作的疆界，都是違反自然形勢，抹殺民族歷史，凡我國民怎能安心怎能忘情呢！（註一）見趙元任現代吳語的研究，民國十七年淸華研究院出版。（註二）見丁文江　文叢刋自序，載於地理學報第二卷第四期，二十四年十二月，中國地理學會出版。（註三）見李濟安陽最近發掘報吿及六次工作之總佔計，載於安陽發掘報吿第叫期，二十二年巾央研究院出版。（註四）見王國維遺著古史新證，二十四年北平來　閣影印。（註五）見英國哈第（Marcel　Hardy）著胡先　譯訂世界植物地理，二十二年商務印書館出版。（註六）見翁文灝中國東部中生代造山運動，載於錐指集，民國十九年地質調查所發行。</p>

<p>中日如期實現</p>
<p>中日通話事、現仍在試騐中、每逢星期一、四、各試通一次、成績尙見美滿、決可如期通話、至於將來通話費用、已定每三分鐘為最少通話時間、計日金十五元、以後每加一分鐘日金五元、以日金作標準者、蓋因國際間向以金法郎為標準、惟折合中日幣頗見麻煩、為便利計、故以日金為單位、</p>

<p>本年北洋嚴寒、白河封凍、甚至大沽口外、海面亦結冰至一百數十里、航道阻斷、交通梗塞、為民元以來所未遇之奇冷、滬上航輪受其妨害、因而遇險者更不一而足、今華商船已完全停航矣、亟將詳情查誌如下、</p>
<p>白河冰斷</p>
<p>天津白河港、為塘沽到紫竹林之唯一水道、亦為北洋船之出入津沽孔道、本年白河冰東、較往年為甚、行輪受阻、本月上旬津海關、因白河內港冰厚一英尺以上、水道交通阻梗、輪行尤為危險、當由津關發布通吿、知照全國各輪公司、聲明白河冰斷、船舶進口、雖用碎冰輪前導、亦無效力、故一般北洋班船、祇可駛抵塘沽口為止、此為本月十日以前之狀况也、</p>
<p>海面封凍</p>
<p>大沽口以外之海面、罕受嚴寒冰凍之影響、本月十五日以後、津沽氣候激變、寒度大增、白河凍後、大沽口外之海面、亦隨之結冰、積歷已多、在十六十七日、海面冰層、自大沽起伸展到海內、而達十三海里之長、至十八日以後冰原日廣、冰層日厚、綿延一片、凝為冰陸、封凍之海面有四十五海里（合一百四十餘華里）冰厚一尺以上、不特人可行走、卽車馬亦可馳騁、一望之餘、幾疑身歷北極圈內、此空前罕有冰海、為民元以來所僅見、</p>
<p>商輪遇險</p>
<p>今回空前冰凍、津海航輪界發生絕大危險、在十七日以前、衝冰冒險駛進大沽口之商輪、均被冰原重重包圍、進退失據、首先受冰之新順天輪、雖有碎冰之特種設備、鋼非常堅厚、猶因衝冰而觸破鐵板、招商局之泰順輪、日淸之崑山丸、在冰圍內歷盡百苦千辛、時用頭衝、時以尾掃、進寸退尺、經過種種危險、始突圍而出、結果泰順船體亦受冰傷、同時其他商輪之遭險者、已不勝枚述、</p>
<p>日船上攤</p>
<p>日輪益進丸、係大連汽船會社滬津連班之運貨輪、載量亦在三千餘噸、今次到津、為堅冰所固、船身阻擱大沽口之南邊灘、因冰厚難救、無法出險、十八日後、該日輪為層冰所擁、未及三日、已將該輪托送到淺灘上、高拱海岸、望之儼然海灘所建之層樓也、據云須俟春暖解凍、始可營救、最早當在兩個月以後耳、</p>
<p>遇順受損</p>
<p>招商局遇順輪、今回赴津、未到塘沽、憶遭冰困、前駛不能、後退無法、船主李雲衢經數天之奮鬥、而致煤缺水乏、曾電滬求、至二十三日始得勉强進港、但前船艙已被冰損破、滲漏進水、津海關檢驗後、已禁止其航行、必令先行補修破漏、再守候時機、隨他輪後跟航出此冰圍、而可返滬修理云、</p>
<p>華輪停航</p>
<p>本埠北洋班內之華商輪、原有裝運雜糧及煤炭之野旂物理學二十餘艘、今因海道已成冰原、航綫亦遭梗塞、刻已完全停赴天津、改行龍口烟台等處矣、卽招商局北洋正班之新豐輪、亦改赴烟台運鹽、新銘則調航福州、須俟解凍後再行復航、惟太古怡和等船、尙在行駛中、因其有碎冰之設備、但船期亦不能一定矣、</p>

<p>年齒雖稚性躭揮霍</p>

<p>造其身心起見、日前將其送入漕河涇上海游民習勤所、俾斯愎改、大通社記者昨驅車至該所探詢、得晤該所所長吳君、即以李道紃送所習勤事、並不否認、據謂依該所規程、凡入所習勤者、不論其家局富有或赤貧、均須作工習勤、惟李自入所後、現仍未肯工作、故尙須經過相當訓導時間、再給與工作、又照所章規定、入所後、必習勤三年、始許出外、故該所對李、自亦須照章辦理、未便例外、</p>

<p>氣盛不衰</p>
<p>陳述時大有怒髪衝冠之槪、據其被吿及其子女、皆由彼負責敎育、被吿留學美國、所費尤多、歸後每年仍給資數千、乃其竟謚其母故後、圖謀將彼綁票、去歲、又對彼起訴、天下那有子綁父票·子控生父·之理、彼實忍無可忍、始提起撤銷繼承權之訴云云、彭推事乃勸以此皆以往之事、不必追溯、而父子對簿、究乖禮俗、如願罷訟、當命被吿具</p>

<p>以後克盡子職、不得猶有不老行為、容鵬聞語、即表示願遵庭上善意、當庭向乃父負荊請罪、詎容尙謙仍怒形於色、拍胸搖首、謂其子從前吿狀、俱係胡說、其母死後、僅遺財產一萬、被吿初則謙稱有遺產四十萬、今更言有二百萬、官、訊以汝今究有財產若干、原吿答稱、前後當、四十年、故略有財產數萬、近歲則做買賣、盈數無定、且亦有欠人者、官遂諭之曰、今汝旣</p>
<p>不欲和解</p>
<p>且必須剝奪被吿繼承權、則應提出證據、陳明理由、若憑汝之空言、被吿亦將不服、於是原吿即詳述其在淸末民初服官之歷史、以證明被吿言其服官未久之不實、庭上繼訊以次子容鴻之現狀及平素相待之情形、原吿乃稱鴻能盡禮、官續詰之曰、汝有兩子、將來汝之所遺當由兩子平均繼承、今汝請求撤銷長子之繼承權、則此一份將屬誰耶、原吿突然曰、將留以</p>

<p>— 中國徵信社主編　（上海工商業概况之十一）　（一）新藥業之今昔</p>
<p>新藥普通又稱西藥，以其初由歐美各國，隨西醫之後而輸入我國故也。其興衰轉變，雖無劃時代之明確依據，然準之大勢，似可分為三個時期。自最初輸至光緒三十年（一九零四年），為初興時期；由光緒三十一年至民國十八年為競爭時期；自民國十九年至目前為轉變時期。今將各期情形分述於後。</p>
<p>初興時期——自一八四二年（道光二十二年），外人根據南京條約，闢上海為商埠後，新藥即於是時開始輸入，初時除各國橋民外，國人頗鮮服用，經營是業者，亦都彼邦人士，如大英醫院（雖名為醫院，實係藥號性質），老德記藥房，屈臣氏羣勇等，所僱中下級職員，俱係華人。其後國人以新藥見效神速，服用簡易，對之漸具信用。大英醫院華籍職員顧松泉，於光緒三十年，首先集資創中西藥房於福州路（開明書局現址），是為華人經營新藥業之濫觴，當時因藥房不多，而華商經營者，又僅該藥房一家，故獲利頗豐。於是其他外商藥房之華籍職員，亦紛紛糾資創設，華英，中央，華美，中德，中法，華洋，南洋（非現在二馬路之華洋及南京路之南洋）等藥房，皆接踵而起。該時期中，雖新創者年有增加，然原有藥房，並不感受影響，每年俱有鉅利可獲，考其原因，約有下列四端，　購用者與年俱增，增出數額，逮過於每年前新創藥房之營業額；　營業種類，較目下為廣，如牙科器具，化妝品，及照相材料等，皆屬於藥房營業範圍之內，　內地藥房寥寥無幾，用戶直接向滬地購買，　外人為批廣銷路計，允許華商之條件較優，而各藥房所加於貨價之利潤，亦較現在為高。</p>
<p>競爭進期——白光緒三十一年（一九零五年）以後，集成，大陸五洲等藥房，相繼創立，小規模藥房如華德，利濟等更如雨後春笋難以屈計，以同業過多，營業逐漸退减待歐戰爆發，始吿復蘇，因戰時雖有美日等國藥品，繼續輸入，而歐西各國出品，來源斷絕，價格暴升，如石炭酸，每磅原售七角五分，曾漲至十四元，非拿昔丁每磅原售三元，漲至六十元，如廿油，每磅由五角漲至一元五角。獅牌六零六，因缺貨之故，最高售價，曾貴至一百二十元一支（原售每支四元）有存貨者，均獲利倍蓰，但戰後又復减色，各家盡採薄利主義，以求多售，一部份且分其注意力於本牌出品。當時本牌出品，較為著名者為人造自來血（五洲藥房出品），六零六藥膏藥水（太和藥房出品），人丹（中法藥房出品），鷄牌骨痛露（濟華堂藥房出品），久咳丸（唐拾義藥廠出品），百靈機（九福公司出品）等六種。</p>
<p>轉變時期——民國十九年以後，銷數未見大量增加，而營業之範圍日蹙，照相材料，已為專營是業者全部奪去，化妝品，亦被廣生行，家庭工業社等化妝品商佔去大半，而牙科器具，則更有齒科商會專事販賣，向藥房採購者，為數極微。而同業之競爭益烈，競以著名藥品，貶價出售，以為招徠之計，如紅色補丸，帕勒托，阿司匹靈，克利西佛，司各脫乳白魚肝油，淸導丸，兜安氏藥膏等，均照本出售，或竟不及成本。嗣由本市新藥業同業公會勸阻，始取消貶價售貨廣吿，但暗中競銷，仍屬唯免，致獲利益艱。故新藥一業，業外人雖未知其詳，業中人則早巳視同鷄肋，迨前年集成藥房擱淺於前（二十三年二十月二十八日停業，二十四年一月二十八日復業），去年華英藥房停業於後，中乾之象，始吿外見，蓋兩藥房在同業中，素以實力雄厚見稱也，年來該業，似有傾向，信製之途，如新亞藥廠，素製售孔雀牙膏等化妝品，自「九一八」後專意製造各種針藥。信誼藥廠，原係德商信誼藥房所創，十九年起，改由華商接辦，其出品之維他賜保命，頗能受人歡迎。五洲藥房更能以大部資金用之於製藥力面。中西藥房，亦有籌組民誼藥廠之舉，其他如海波，康樂等藥廠，皆致力於仿製一途，似巳感覺徒恃販賣，終非得計也。（未完）</p>

<p>馬約翰談選拔標凖</p>
<p>馬約翰氏談、此次參加世運預選、由全國體育恊進會主持、將來代表選出後、是否集中訓練、須視經浪情形而定、此次出席世運、奪標自屬無望、惟為觀光琢磨、使吾國選手有他山攻錯之益、故選拔票準除或績外、對於代表之體格道德、及體育修養、均須兼顧、庶將來世運後回國、仍能繼續努力、創造優越紀錄、使我國體育得能猛進、庶不負此次參加世運之本意、本人（馬自稱）與宋董二氏、定出月一日率隊北返、惟袁禮登氏則定明日（二十九日）光行返津云、</p>
<p>董守義談藍球人材</p>
<p>又據董守義宋君復氏談此次藍球選拔、覺得我國對於鋒中衛三類人才、甚為平均、實力尙佳、至於正式代表、須待與本埠西人勁旅交戰數次後、方能决定、此次選拔完全以人才為標凖、決不以獲勝團體為基本、蓋某一團無論如何堅强、必難免無弱點、反言之、失販團體中、未始無優秀人才、故此次先於各隊中選拔優秀球員、然後加以相當訓練、以冀增加全作工夫、則實力當設以獲勝隊為基本為住、將來於世運中或不致一販塗地、</p>
<p>李惠堂談足球選拔</p>
<p>據李惠堂氏談、參加世運足球人選意見、為節省旅費及以免路途跋涉、鄙意預選實母須舉行、蓋此次選拔純以人才為標凖、據本人推測、各個技術於全運會時早為體育當局所認識、代表額定二十名、大約香港廣東可佔大半、南洋僑胞不乏好手、亦可得三四人、其餘當由華東華北選出、全部代表產生後、本人意見最好集合香港訓練、以增合作工夫、於出國時再來滬上比賽數場、然後沿途再約勁旅比賽、以資切磋、將來世運會時、倘初賽不即遇勁敵、或能多得幾次出場機會、本人屆時倘無特別事故、當能成行云、</p>

<p>「也許是他拿的」，內達叫道，他因那次被浸入水中，不免含恨在心，旣然是和一般童子沒甚區別，也願借此回報一下。</p>
<p>「啊唐恩！」乃德喊道，合住了他的兩手，他那時還拿着一塊塗了半油的麵包咧。</p>
<p>「這是一件苦痛的事體，可是我必得把這次的事情理個清楚，因為我不能要你們相互監視如偵探一般，使全校那麼不安。今天早晨倉庫裏那塊洋鈿是你放進去嗎！」裴先生問道。</p>
<p>唐恩直視他的臉，一點不游移地回答道，「是的，是我放進去的。」</p>
<p>於是竊私語之聲起於四座，韜摩的水瓶竟失手墮　然粉碎；小梅喊道，「我本知道不是乃德拿的；」南恩開始哭了，蜀夫人離開了那房間，看去那麼失望，悵惘而羞愧，唐恩實在覺得難受，他以兩手掩蓋他的臉兒，一會兒又將　子一挺，兩肩一聳，好像一整那上面的負荷，於是以他初來時一種執坳的臉容好一半堅定一半無忌憚的聲情說道：</p>
<p>「是我做的；現在由你們喜歡怎麼辦我，我對這事不願再說一句話。」</p>

<p>標紗長豐盡量吐出</p>
<p>前市開盤、以標金開出無力下落、公債頭盤雖上漲、美棉三品與休假前均無上下、人心不好、多頭遂吿失、長豐多額盡量吐出、以致檯面籌碼充盈、市盤乃步步下落、結果各月比一月十八日收盤價均跌一元二·四·五·六角、午後開盤、仍屬不振、有一部分議論謂存貨增加、長豐多頭續來賣出、市塲形勢平淡、惟裕大空頭抵補、然市况依舊無神、但現紗客方需求甚殷、結果各月比上午收盤價跌四角至七八角、查賣出梅記一千包記五百五十包、合興七百包、賡豐九百五十包、泰昌五百包、長豐四千七百包、新華三百包、裕康一各二百包、明華五百包、買進源大三百五十包、大豐三百五十包、錦昌一千三百包、大昌成四百包、益昶一千九百五十包、潤康四百包、永大四百五十包、同和三千四百五十包、信誠五百包、裕大一千一百五十包、泰昌四百五十包、一日問最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>偶閱舊雜誌，見丹徒李吟白有讀汪水雲集感詠十二首，詩中語句，頗多述及水雲生平，如「側身天地老琴師，惆悵三宮北徒時；萬水千山行不得，斷腸人詠斷腸詩。」案汪水雲名元量，宋末琴工，其詩愴側多故國之思，宋亡後，隨王室北去，後為道士南歸。</p>
<p>南北朝宋臨川王劉義慶的世說，原為八卷，梁劉孝標注釋補其闕，擴為十卷，今通行本僅有三卷，據謂由宋人晏殊刪成如此，余頗疑晏殊何以將它割愛這大半數，想來此書於宋以前，也許早亡佚好多了。</p>
<p>幼時先嚴嘗以康熙制錢背面文字不同者二十種，謂余曰：此二十字適湊成五六言詩一首，每字按地方一處，其文字如下：「同福臨東江，宣源蘇薊昌，寗河南廣浙，台陝貴雲章。」今搜索道篋，所集錢已零落不全，而當此山河破碎，國土不能完整之際，重憶舊事，與此制錢有同感矣！（琴聲）</p>

<p>儷琴少讀宋史，至丹陽太學生陳東上書被誅，嘗為掩卷歔欷，竊歎古者帝王專政，言路壅塞，忠言殺身，竟至斯極！乙亥孟夏，余自婁東解席言旋，家居養晦，日以書卷自遺，以消永畫，及邑乘，得陳公三疏，展卷端誦，又為掩卷吁喟，頗訝陳公當僉壬飛揚跋扈之時，極言時政，力斥權奸，筆伐墨誅，恣意議彈，蕭霜夏日，望而懔然，宜其身膏斧銊，終為佞人所構；而陳公忠綆蹇　，心在家國，雖鼎　在前，毅然以一吐為快，廉頑立懦，洵足為晉邑建樹風標，使後世想歎風節，仰止匆已，與賈長沙先後媲美矣。共和以來，外强侵侮，鯨吞蠶食，日以俱深，往歲國人寒心，每興荊棘銅駝之歎，而莘莘學子，尤切亡國滅族之憂，嘗數見結衆呼號，請願樞府。靖康中，宋室不競，余人入寇，天下危如髪絲，而宰執大臣，陰與外寇相通，力執割地請成之議，朝廷有一二許身社稷之人，則擠陷之使不能安於位，俾勿沮其奸謀。於是陳公以布衣之士，率太學同舍生千百人，伏闕上書，抗疏請命，一時聞者風從，至十數萬人之衆。當時叩　闕下，猶不期而合者，非若今人之預謀會合，結羣以行也。然激於忠義，志切救國，上下古今，同出一轍耳。故余嘗竊擬陳公靖康伏闕之舉，實開我中國民衆請願運動之先河，伸張民權，亙古罕見，陳公其殆為之倡始乎？攷邑乘，陳公有文集十卷，列入四庫，恨未見也。尋聞鄉前輩眭子美元生言，乃知陳公故居邑之越塘，距吾家僅六七里，意其後裔必有藏本，嘗欲訪求借讀，又苦未得其由。會與畏友沈君習公，話及此事，迺承慨然以曹邱自任，乞借於其友陳君石淦處，歸而讀之，得以快覩。余於沈君，拜嘉無旣。又聞石淦君曰：吾族陳氏，昔奉少陽公建炎第三書稿為傳家寳，洪楊後，恨失所在，手澤僅存，唯此而已。然則此集流布當必不廣，因益珍之，亟挽劉君致中任抄胥，匝月始竟其功。又邑乘所載，有集中未列者，為一一補錄，異日他籍中倘有獲見，當更為摭存，翼於廣收博採，重為編次，而謀剞　焉。校閱旣畢，謹識數語以誌之。</p>

<p>— 汝</p>
<p>海寧是觀潮名地，在塘畔，又有「鎮海塔」及「鎮海鐵牛」的名勝，來遊海寧的人，少不得要在它旁邊瞻仰和撫摩一番；可是，於這座有歷史意義的「三烈士塔，」却往往忽略了</p>
<p>三烈士塔位於海塘畔，是紀念光復時商圈團長龐景賢烈士和團員朱錫周，俞錫麟烈士而建築的。當時，因清庭的政治腐敗，浙之沿海一帶海盜　起，商船就時常被其掠奪。人民生計，幾被中斷。而清兵疏懶成性，不想征剿，因此激動了龐團長的義憤，領導數百新經訓練的商團，前赴應敵。結果，海盜是平靖了，而麗團長和朱俞二團員以及許多老百姓，也因此而犧牲了性命。</p>
<p>此塔在民國十七年十月間由商人集資建立，雖然簡單異常，但遠遠望去，十分雄壯。</p>

<p>— 一震</p>
<p>陳時，在故鄉亭林，留居過一個偉大的文學家，野王顧希馮先生，顧氏幼時，即聰明好學，九歲能文，嘗制日賦，十二歲時，隨了他父親到建安，在那里他得讀到許多經史精記，所以對於天文地理耆鮑占候虫篆奇字，無所不通，顧氏不但博學，並且又長丹青，所以在建安顧氏的才名很盛。</p>
<p>後來，侯景作亂，野王丁父憂歸兆募鄉黨，隨義軍救援京都。顧氏本來很瘦弱，又遭了父喪，更現得清　，可是他保國之心驅使他披起盔甲，執着長戈，作投筆從戎的壯舉。他當時向所率者陳說君臣之義，逆順之理，義氣甚激昂，聽者莫不壯之，雖然結果不能挽救，可是他的忠勇很值得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>顧氏晚年便留居在亭林，修　地志，他每日著作之處的「讀書堆」，至今還留存在故鄉。　氏卒年六十二，據華亭縣志云墓在亭林西南，可是今已無從查考了。</p>
<p>顧氏著作極豐，有王篇三十卷，國史紀傳二百卷，顧氏　傳，建安地記二卷，通史要略，符珊圖自一卷，符瑞圖目十卷，續洞冥記一卷，顧野王集二卷。</p>

<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴　傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>他把二人這樣大背了一陣子歷史，方才落座。賈多才看那王先生時，穿一件藍布夾袍，頭上禿了一個光頭顱，長圓的黃臉兒，蓄了許多短椿鬍子。雖是衣衫很樸素的，可是他兩隻眼睛，英光燦燦，還不失為一位練達人情的人。金子强說他是一位忠厚長者，這可有些不解了。於是向他點了一點頭道：王先生在這西安城裏，地皮很多嗎？王寶成向金子强先看了一看，才笑着答道：我有什麼地皮，不過是族人公有的，我是這裏面的一人。族下人因為我到過一次下江，就以為我和東方人說得來，推我來和金先生接洽。買多才道：但不知是什麽地方一塊地？金子强道：就在北門外，這是大家都知道的，那個地方，不久要成火車站。我們那塊地方很大，據內行估價，那裏要值兩萬塊錢。金子强就搶着打了一個哈哈道：那裏值許多錢，也許那是十年以後的話了。王先生，你不要聽別人的閑話，那無非是騙你的。我這個人你總知道，是非常爽直的人。說着，將桌上的茶，遞了一杯到他手上。因笑道：你先喝杯茶潤潤喉嚨。說着，又到床頭邊去，在網篮子裏取出一個紙匣子，放到桌上，笑道：這是上海帶來的鷄蛋糕，雖然乾一點，却還是可以吃，請嚐一點。說着，兩個指頭，箝了一塊鷄蛋糕，送到王實誠手上，笑道：我們這樣好的朋友，你還客氣什麽？以後我們共事的日子，就多着啦。賈多才在一邊看到這情形，心裏就十分了然，於是向金子强淡淡的問了一聲道：金兄已經出了一定的地價了嗎？王實誠是剛剛的咬了一口鷄蛋糕：立刻答道：連咸陽那一塊地皮，金先生只出到一萬塊錢。金子强就笑着搖了一搖頭道：這樣一個大數目，王先生你以為還是很少嗎？（三九六）</p>

<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>本載於去年十二月二十八日載各省所選定的歷代鄉賢表，覺得有一些可疑之處，特提出來和讀者談談。</p>
<p>據表上載，有三個顏眞卿，一個是陝西，一個是山東，一個是浙江。但是我們在歷史上，祗曉得唐代有一個顏眞卿，是浙江人，是否他的籍貫有錯誤，或者陝西山東另有顏眞卿其人，這就不大明瞭了。不過僻源載云：「唐臨沂人，字清臣，玄宗時為平原太子，安祿山反，獨倡義討之，亂平，遷刑部尙書，封魯國公。德宗時，慰諭李希烈，持節不屈，為所縊殺，謚文忠。善正草書，筆力遒勁秀拔。」據此擇顏眞卿確為浙江的臨沂縣人，何以陝西山東各有一人，這是可疑之一。</p>
<p>三國時候的曹操，數千年來打架都認他是奸雄；英雄固足崇拜，然而在雄字之上，冠以奸字，總未便選為鄉賢，現在安徽也居然列入，似乎有些不當，這是可疑之二。</p>
<p>上列兩點，尙祈高明正之！</p>
<h3 id="c181">龍砂山紀事 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 天厓</p>
<p>前幾天有事到江陰去，經過縣屬東鄉華墅鎮，承友人的招留，在那裏住了一夜，遊覽了幾處地方。在宋末元初時代，華墅本是沿長江的巨鎮，也是江北南通海門等處販售棉花的大市塲，所以　名「花市」。後來長江南岸砂土漸漲，華墅和長江的距離也漸遠，現在已相去有三十里了。</p>
<p>靠近街市的北面，有一座龍砂山，還有一個忠義祠。從形式上說來，龍砂山是高不滿十丈的小山，忠義祠也一樣的荒涼平凡，不值一遊的，但因為這兩個去處和我們民族光榮史都有些關係，倒也不可不記。</p>
<p>在龍砂山半腰，有一片五六丈平方的草地，那便是明末時節，我們的民族英雄閻應元將軍奉養老母的地方，現在房子自然沒有了，但四周石築的宅基，還很平正的顯露在地面上。閻將軍的家鄉，本在河北通縣，他帶了老母到江陰來，不過做一個典史小官，（和現在的縣公安局長差不多）居然負起抗禦外患，挽救殆局的重任，結果自然免不了一死，而全城百姓，因被他的忠義所感動，也沒有一個不死難的，這更是一件悲壯沉痛的事。所以他死後的英風偉烈，和在揚州血戰殉國的史閣部（可法），在嘉定抗敵死難的黃尙書（淳耀）等人物，一樣是光耀史冊，彪炳千秋呢！</p>
<p>山麓松樹甚多，朔風掠過，樹梢透着蕭瑟的聲響，那是閻將軍在替我們這般奄奄一息的民族太息吧？</p>
<p>再望南數百步，便是奉祀閻將軍的忠義祠，因為祠裏已辦了一個小學校，所以全祠房屋還不十分破舊，那天假起期，師生都不在校，將軍的泥像，靜靜地端坐在正廳壁龕中，戴的烏紗帽，穿着紅袍，一副嚴正的面目，使人不敢迫視，但這祠和像，已是在清代乾隆時造的了，泥像和他的本來面目，或許也有些不同的地方，然而我很相信是不會十分相差的，因為凡是熱血的男兒，他的作為，他的結果，大都相同，正如戲台上一樣，綠面紅鬚的大都是强盜，白面的大都是奸賊，這種象徵的表示，倒也不妨可以存在，使人們得着一點深切的印象。</p>
<p>應前天井中種着一株番橙樹，枝葉茂盛，肥大的香橙，閃着金色的光芒，「秋老霜皮敷蜜臘」這正和閻將軍操勵風霜的大節相輝映。</p>
<p>友人說：「每年逢到將軍的　　（二月十六）和忌辰（八月廿一）兩天，在以前是全鎮人都要到祠祭拜的，現在也就是冷落了，逢到道天，不過點些香燭，幾個道人唸一天經就算了。」我想閻將軍的偉大，原無須得香燭道人來頌揚的，我們紀念民族英雄，是極正當的舉動，但須注意方法和意義的適當才是。好比我走到龍砂山，如果沒有友人指點，誰還認得出那一片革地就是民族英雄的故居呢？</p>
<p>當我離開龍砂山和忠義祠的時候，薄暮的斜陽，祠剩着一縷最　的光輝，松風冷冷地吹過，心靈益發感到無限的淒涼寂寞。</p>
<h3 id="c182">海東 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>海東十萬　　間，齊攏罡風止國門，不盡荒陵軒后淚，無多落日　州痕；中原禮讓過三舍，今日存亡決兩言，休薄當年韓伌冑，也曾江上出征　。</p>
<p>大雪飛輪五夜開，春婆　擾夢初回；蘊愁肺腑將生角，流涕河山欲化灰！家祭難忘詩北奠，國荒未必鳳西來？勞他太學上書急，草野無錢餞一杯。</p>
<h3 id="c183">孔雀開屏 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 其中</p>
<p>我久聞人言孔雀之好勝，說是見了花枝般的姑娘，必須開屏與之賽美。這話我一直相信不疑。我在公園中見到的孔雀已不少，但從未見過一次孔雀開屏，我每以為我近旁的人，在孔雀眼中還不夠美的緣故。三年前在北平，見到中央公園的孔雀，也老是不開屏，我終以為我近旁的人在孔雀眼中不夠美。可是，有一天，我同了幾個女友到中央公園去，而且女友中海油一位某大學的皇后，打扮得十分美麗，差不多無論誰對伊都要行一下注目禮的。皇后跳舞了，幾個女友歌唱了，孔雀在棚中除踱着方步外，僅把翅尾稍稍動了一下，然而還是不開屏。又一次，我一個人走進中央公園，恰好孔雀走在棚的外邊，我突然走到它前面，把披着大衣展開了，手中的手杖舞着，孔雀急急踱了進去，此刻竟開屏了。我不相信我的灰色大衣在孔雀眼中認為美麗的，我同時看着孔雀開屏後的翅尾，每根毛顫抖，因想孔雀的開屏，不見得是賽美，或者是恐懼。</p>
<p>今年上半年，從家裏到公司中去或是從公司中回家，一天至少要走過虹口狄思威路的東洋弄二次。東洋弄中空着的洋房很多，有一宅不住人，院中養有一頭火鷄，想係鄰屋主人養着的。火鷄與孔雀，除了毛羽以外，我看來也差不到那裏。這頭火鷄，我時見有許多孩子在鐵門旁用石子擲它，火鷄一面張尾展翅，每根毛顫動着「啯啯」地呌着。但有時不見有孩子在旁邊，它並不如是，可見火鷄之開屏，完全在受了恐懼，那麼，孔雀開屏，不是賽美而是受驚，似乎此說也有成立的價值了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c184">石殷「通」而不「緝」 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>石友三曾經受過中央通緝，殷汝耕也曾經受過中央通緝。然而他們二人，現在不但「通」而不「緝」，且都有大官好做。一個將任北平保安司令，一個將任天津巿長。這倒是全國高唱「打倒漢奸」聲中一椿很滑稽的事！</p>
<p>石為我國舊軍閥之一，從前掌握軍符時，曾經顯赫過一塲。後來却終於失敗了。但他雖下台，在北方還有相當的潛勢力，故近來頗見活動。或傳其組織什麼軍，或說其運動自治。惟間也有一些人，謂他卸棄軍權後，卽深居簡出，不問外事。石本人近亦向人聲辯，一向只知守已安分，但常給人在外假借名義，作非法的行動，致不諒於國人。其實石之為人，其對國家的功罪，自有事實作證明，明識者早能見之。然而他現在被宋哲元很看重，將「東山再起」，充任北平保安司令了。聞石曾要求任冀察政委會委員，當局因石長於「韜略」，故電中央，請撤消其通緝令，委以保安司令之職。不知石就職後，將如何運用其「韜略」？我們一班小百姓，不妨從旁加以監視吧！</p>
<p>殷呢？近來也很露頭角，因為據說他是一個「日本通」的人物，故當局委以薊密區專員之職。他的才識怎樣，我們不大明白。惟知道他自任專員以後，在外交上的折衝，頗得「友邦」的信任。不過他這回野心却勃勃了，雖專員之職，也不高興幹，竟大着膽子，在通州樹起叛旗，倚靠其背景，一舉而掠取戰區二十二縣於掌握中，做其偽自治政府的傀儡首領！惜現在的中國百姓，不甚好惹，一見殷的通電發出，登時「討逆」之聲，響遍全國。就連他的兄弟，也憤懣非常，主張非予以懲戒不成。可見他的「出賣祖國」的行為，是無可恕的了。然而他現在却變為「第一號」的要人，和某方往來很密切，有「飛黃騰達」之勢。這决冀東問題的磋商，聽說辦法為殷取消偽組織，由宋哲元電請中央免予通緝，並恢復其舊職，或任為天津市長。這事果能實現，那末股雖未得如願以償，但反叛之後，仍然有官好做，也頗過的去了！</p>
<p>在這個年頭，什麼綱紀，什麼威信，原是不能過於認眞的。像石友三和殷汝耕這二人，為國家的罪人，給全國民所唾棄。但他們畢竟來頭不小，當局不但奈何不得，還要請他們出任要職，替黨國效勞。不過此例一開，將來一班「活動分子，」大可以橫行無忌了。成則為王，敗也還有出處，那個不願冒一下險呢？怪不得我國近來漢奸，竟會這樣「層出不窮」。</p>
<p>中國人作事，永是猜不透的！</p>
<h3 id="c185">舊夢 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 阿仁</p>
<p>我睜開惺忪的眼睛，四圍是一團漆黑，淑的手輕輕拍着我的肩膀，黑暗中，只看見一件小東西筷上我的耳朶，像　虫似的，嗡嗡地對我說：「阿仁，快醒醒，不好了！」</p>
<p>「什麼？」我打了個哈欠，側過身子，可以看見躺在我身邊的淑的輪廓了。</p>
<p>淑早就害怕得直發抖，看見我側過身來，就把頭一骨碌地鑽入我的懷襄，不　話。</p>
<p>情形是有點異樣，在我因為委實支持不下而閉上眼睛入睡之前，全艙裹有三隻媒油燈照得挺亮挺亮的，現在連一隻燈都熄掉了，我仔細一靜聽，除了船老大在別個船艙裹呌「快吹熄燈，快吹熄燈，」之外，淑的母親和好幾個老太婆縮在艙的壁角裹，在低低地急念：「阿彌陀佛，阿彌陀佛。」</p>
<p>淑抬起瞪着的大眼睛，在黑暗裹閃着光，對我說：「我剛剛閉上眼睛入睡的時候，船身突然一震，左右幌了幾幌，就此不動了，我們正在詫異的當兒，船老大從船梢跑過來，聽我們快把燈熄掉，而且還可囑我們千萬不要吵，其餘的艙裹他也同樣這樣可囑着，你看，誰都瑟縮地等待着一個不測的大禍臨頭」。淑說完，二隻手緊捏着我的手，頭又埋入了我的懷裹。</p>
<p>眞的，引擎的響聲也沒有了，船身好像入睡了似的，就懶懶地躺在那兒，二旁的江水衝擊，就像它的沉重的鼾聲，在恐怖的黑暗裹一下一下的響着，直壓着每個人的呼吸。</p>
<p>我這時完全淸醒了，老太婆們的那種急促的「阿彌陀佛」的喘息，實在使我發笑，可是一種意外的恐怖的突擊，在漆黑的寂靜的夜裏，是異樣的刺擊着我的神經。</p>
<p>突然，遠處傳來了一兩聲砲聲，在死寂的長空裹淸晰地戰抖着，我分不淸這是我國的，還是敵人的，但是我知道，我們已經停留在戰錢裏了。</p>
<p>我和淑坐起身來拉開了小圓窗上的簾，從遼闊的閃着銀色鱗片的江面望過去，那東邊灰暗的角落裏，劃時代的暴風雨就在那兒降着，那雷聲，那閃光，那紅色的火，那火裏隱現着的慷慨，憤怒的臉，那為我們犧牲了的破碎的肢體，和熱氣飄升的赤血，剛才襲上我神經來的恐怖，這時慢慢地消失了。</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛，阿陀彌佛」的急喘逐漸移近我的身邊，回過頭去，趁着月光，我看見了淑的母親的那種急慌的僉，乾枯的手裹顫顫地拿着一件長袍。</p>
<p>「徐先生，你快把你身上的洋裝脫掉，換上這件長袍，回頭　　兵來了，才不會疑心你是個學生而把你抓去呢。</p>
<p>我把那件長袍從她手裹接了過來，望望淑的臉，淑的振動的嘴和眼睛，同樣在希求我快把身上的服裝換掉，看看那種可憐而又可羞的懦怯的樣子，我禁不住笑出聲來了。</p>
<p>「假使我眞被　　兵抓了去給殺掉了，淑，你預備怎麼樣？」我帶着笑，問淑。</p>
<p>「我一輩子不嫁人！」聲音多少帶一點莊重。</p>
<p>「一輩子不嫁人？」一種封建的陳舊的思想是這樣深深地纏住了淑。為什麼不立刻想到聯合起羣衆來為我報仇呢？我開始惆悵了。</p>
<p>四年來，這惆悵，像輕烟一樣，永遠，永遠，繚繞在我的心頭。</p>

<p>——夜里要經心點，不要爛睡不醒呵！</p>
<p>睡覺的時候，張伕頭又拐回來這樣的交代着，紫褐色的臉堂，罩上了一層肅殺。</p>
<p>油燈，糢糊的看得出每個人面部的輪廓，窗外，大自然的澗流像埋藏了千軍萬馬，遠處，偶然的有一兩聲回響，彷彿荒野鬼嗥，使每個人的汗毛都會不由的竪起來，大家有着一個共同的心：「這恐怖的觀音橋之夜」呵！</p>
<p>同路的人，圍攏着，舉行會議了。空氣，在緊張里包涵了熱烈的希冀吶！</p>
<p>——我們要分班睡覺，看守着這整個的全夜！這是最後的决定。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>頭一班派定了阿黃·小劉·祥森三個，一班是三個鐘頭。</p>
<p>照情形說，自然是可以高枕大臥了，然而，恐怖的氣息刺激着心弦，誰又能睡得着呢？聽着，聽着，院子里，有他們三個人的雜亂的脚步，走過來，又踱回去，誰都不說什麼，夜，靜穆得像死去了的洪荒時代。</p>
<p>正在下弦的日子，月亮是看不見的，院子里，漆一樣的黑。有的時候，他們三個被不熟悉的路徑絆一下，或者碰那滑杆，以及什麼零碎的東西所發出來的聲音，就會驚動了躺在床上的人，下意識的想到豪客的到來，或者也許會如此的。</p>
<p>廊簷底下，送進來一陣鼻鼾聲，伕子們的「自身以外，別無他戀」，的神情到底是可愛的，他們不思慮自我以外的一切，塞在胸膛里的，有一個明日生活的解决。</p>
<p>那隻小台鐘淸楚的敲了十二下。阿黃·他們三個交班了。第二决該派充中，是我，老鐵，還有一個是闊嘴楊。</p>
<p>——怎麼樣，沒有什麼風色吧？</p>
<p>——有了風色那還了得。就這樣，聽到了任何的小響動，都會擊碎了全部的心胆呢！</p>
<p>不容推諉的，把任務背到肩上，自忖着，上半夜的時問還此較好過，下半夜呢？難說。豪客大半會在子夜以後出現的，不是嗎？他們都帶有一幅殺氣的面容，假使，眞的出現的話，那……不必想這可怕的慘象吧！</p>
<p>——等我們的班值完以後，天快亮了，還怎麼能爬山呢？</p>
<p>這的確是一個値得提出的問題，山路，那樣的崎嶇坑坎，又恰在熱天，重量扛在伕子們的肩頭，紫紅的血絲時常的會黏在竹杆的兩端，這荒野的流放的地域里，他們在股切的企望着旅客門能給予些同情，自己也爬點高昻的山路。</p>
<p>——値班的人，上路在兜里睡。阿黃說，把原有的重量减輕，分散到旁的担子上。</p>
<p>後跨院，老鐵和我都無聊的各據着一隅，閑步着。這里的蚊子眞够利害，一羣飛過來，嘴里哼着悅耳的小調，一會，皮膚癢得難熬，用毛巾槎一回，又熱得發燒一樣。</p>
<p>忽然，街那頭有了脚步聲，雜夾的遂有些聽不淸的話語。立刻，我們三個聚集在一起，躱在前面櫃台的旁邊。慢慢地近了，更近了，從聲音聽去，總在五個人以上。</p>
<p>——這里，是這里，還沒有來過！一個口音怪粗暴的。對其他的人說。</p>
<p>我們三個，開始的抖顫了，怎樣去對付呢？軟是沒有用的，硬，他們的人多，自己的武器這樣少，又如何能够抵禦呢？怕？退縮？完全的陷落在徬偟的圈子里。</p>
<p>才一轉眼，幾個人已進了店堂，用電筒四下里照射着，腰際那垂下來的東西，不是逞雄一時的盒子砲麼？在電筒的彼此映照里，我發覺來的人沒有戴頭巾，也沒有穿什麼緊身的馬甲，由領口的符號，意識到他們是這里的團丁，負荷着保安的使命。</p>
<p>——這些轎子，東西，是什麼人的？有一個問了。</p>
<p>——我們的。老鐵跳出去吿訴他，還說了些從那里來，預備往何處去的俗套子。</p>
<p>對於老鐵的話，他似乎不大相信，在他的意念里，或許認為那突然是不可能的。隨後，他把插在包簍上的旂子看了肴，點着頭，連說着客氣的話，走了。</p>
<p>脚步的聲音，消失在那一頭，長街，還像前時一樣的死寂。</p>
<p>輕悄的又跨進了後院，蚊子照常的奏着小曲，草虫，拉開了嗓子在狂鳴，幾片游雲蕩過來，往西方浮去。天色，在踏上了黎明的階段了。</p>

<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>傍晚，南國的村鎭輕輕地披着疲乏的蘊藏着無限的凉意的太陽光。那一雙一個的很多的進市的鄉人們已零零星星地帶着他們的貨品回家去了，市塲和狹小的街道上已淸靜的，我們一團年輕的人們再不能够逗留在這一個小小的市鎭上，就準備着向開平的地方去。</p>
<p>跨出了白沙的市塲就是一條長長的通過田洞的小道，那黃金色的平野和竹林間漸漸地顯得陰暗起來，一陣一陣的寒風掠過了我們的心胸，廣漠地看不到一個鄉人了，這快要滾進了黑夜的鄉野里，我們這一羣陌生的人門不禁地起了一陣担憂的心情來：</p>
<p>「到峴崗還要三個鐘頭的汽車哩！快天黑啦！」領導的人說着。</p>
<p>我們跑到了汽車站的時候，還有一輛汽車停在那里，那司機和廠里的人們好像不高典我們似的皺着眉頭，瞪着我們嚕囌着：</p>
<p>「車不開了，你們不早點來，天快黑啦。」</p>
<p>「為什麼不開呢？你們不帮帮救國宣傳隊的忙嗎？我們一定要趕到峴崗去呀！」關君打着他們本地話說了，又安慰我們：「不要管這些奸商吧！我們坐在車廂里，非等到開車不可，勝利是我們的。」</p>
<p>嚕囌間，三個客人上車了，我們透了一口氣的也擠進車廂里，那司機無可奈何地開車了，但是，車行得很慢，那凹凸不平的公路把汽車連帶着我們拋盪着，一上一下的，我們的飢餓的肚子里跟着也兜着跟斗了，那時，從車廂的窗子望出去，只是一片朦迷的夜色已緊緊地把山野包圍着，天色越着陰黑，我們的精神越是緊張了起來。</p>
<p>到了一個三叉路口，汽車突然的停了下來，這倒使我們心里吃驚不少，跟着，那三個客人因為到了他們的目的地就下車，揚長的走了。那瘦瘦的車夫也狡猾地透了一口氣的：</p>
<p>「車不可以再行了，我們的車只到這里，前面的一段路是別一家公司的。我們的公司是沒有權行駛的。等一會見就有車來了。」</p>
<p>我們看見這樣的情形，心里不禁地憤怒了起來，關君喝着：</p>
<p>「那里的話？你要騙我們嗎？我們自己開車吧！」</p>
<p>可是，沒有一個人會開汽車的，况且這黑夜里，完全看不到什麼的山野中，我們怎麼趕程呢？於是，由於憤怒而吼了起來：</p>
<p>「我們打破了這輛車吧；我們可以跑路去，這兒到峴岡還有二十里路。」跟着，我們就要動手壓迫那車夫：「你要做亡國奴嗎？你不知道東北的喪失，上海的打仗嗎？愧你是廣東人呵！」</p>
<p>喝吆着；我們一　靑年人的火　起燒了起來了。</p>
<p>這時，我們看　　什麼，遠遠的山野的黑團團　　地展開着，哨哨的風聲　，兩旁的野草只是畏縮似的　　　，還有遠遠的山村里透出來幾聲輕輕的犬的吠着。我們的心里起了一陣一陣的怖恐，就好像担憂着已蹈進了强盜的窠里去似的。從黑夜里看望着每個人的緊張的滿着憤怒而怖恐的神情，有些還在抖顫着呢。</p>
<p>車依然向着黑漆山野里奔駛着，一上一下的跳蕩着心腸，我們還不曾感輕了一點兒的怖恐地縮在車廂里相望着。</p>
<p>像得到了光明似的，我們到了峴崗的時候，那冷靜的車站里，在淡黃的燈光底下，我們看到了一羣小孩子們和兩個敎師在那里等等我們了。而且，他們在歡呌着：</p>
<p>「歡迎　　救國宣傳團！」</p>
<p>我們的心里跟着又燒起了愉快的熱情來了。</p>

<p>鎭日尋春不見春。來原是幻無形。寒梅喜報春先至。春到江南景物新。我說道，大地陽春眞有脚。獨留春帝住春城。但是那，春風村峭春寒重。春雨　綿春恨深。我正是，春畫欲眠春意懶。好敎那，春陰曲護海棠心。只恐怕，夜來風雨春花泣。春在枝頭怕聽駑。到今朝，春日載陽春氣動。無邊春極滿園林。剪蔬雨後添春筍。聯佐春盤列非辛。恰好是，新劈襄頭春釀熟。春官桃李宴門庭。有時節，出門尋訪遊春伴。雨　春郊碧草生。祗為春泥防咱滑。看見是，踏靑春屐印芳　。遙望那，錄波春水篙添漲。淺黛春山滿郭靑。又見那，一角春旗沽酒處。查花春暖賣錫聲。只為是，春闌三月鶯花夢。春訊頻傳島囀音。春　暮雲空悵惘。依依春柳短長亭。獨奈何，狂蜂浪蝶春無賴。花落殘春不繫情。只怪那，到死春蠶絲縛。春衣欲濕　沾襟。我　那，春歸春易催人老。辜負春光感不禁。滿地落花春去後。春暉歡駐歲華驚。到那時，花開花謝春無主。只覺得，春燕歸來何處尋。自古傷春悲杜牧。春愁黯黯最銷魂。試問他，一場春夢屬何人。</p>

<p>「花燭之夜」是藝華公司一九三六年度最名貴出品，是岳楓繼「逃亡」後最精心最偉大傑作。</p>
<p>「藥燭之夜」提示了兩個靑年男女最切身的問題，可是被壓迫在專制勢力下的買賣婚姻，另一則是被建築在拜金主義上的自由戀愛。</p>
<p>「那一個年靑的姑娘不懷春？」「花燭之夜」便是抓住了這一點，解剖了靑春期少女的心理狀態，並由此所誘起的愛慾行動，所以「花燭之夜」等于一部靑春讀本，又等於一部戀愛經。</p>
<p>「花燭之夜」又好像是一壺蜜餞，一瓶陳醋，一盤胡椒，一碟　汁，又甜又酸，又苦又辣。</p>
<p>「不自由母寧死」！袁美云在「花燭之夜」中為着愛這樣和惡環境掙扎着，然而她到底還是一頭無力抵抗的小綿羊啦！</p>
<p>「花燭之夜」有着極複什的愛的葛藤，如袁美云與王引，王引與林玲，林玲與張白黎，再袁美云與關宏達，關宏達與周璇，周璇與劉犂等，隨着劇情的開展，這些愛的渦漩，如風似浪，波瀾重壘，變化萬千。</p>
<p>「花燭之夜」是人人應看的一部有着極好意的影片，年靑的小姐，　愛的情侶，看了如同吃了一杯冰淇淋，週身舒適，心花怒放，至于年老的太太看了，如同吃了一只檀香橄欖，愈嚼愈有味兒，愈嚼有甘味。</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Executive Yuan is deeply concerned that student patriotic movements in various schools have affected order and discipline. On the 28th, it instructed the Ministry of Education to forward instructions to various schools, halls, and bureaus to strictly rectify the situation. The Ministry of Education has forwarded the instructions for compliance. The original order is as follows: "The Executive Yuan instructs that hardship strengthens the nation, as the ancients have said. In this time of serious national crisis, people in the education sector should guide young people to abide by discipline, take responsibility, be of one heart and one mind, follow a unified course, and make orderly efforts to gather national strength and save the country from hardship. When recently meeting with principals and student representatives from various schools, the President of the Executive Yuan solemnly stated this purpose and earnestly explained the government's policy. The student movements in various places were originally driven by patriotic enthusiasm, but soon they inevitably overstepped the boundaries of propriety. Discipline has completely collapsed in some schools, and teaching has been suspended. Strict measures should be taken to correct this. Now that the winter vacation is coming to an end, public and private schools in various provinces and cities should resume classes on schedule and return to normal. School principals and teachers should be jointly responsible for guiding students and putting them back on the right track. In the future, any student who does not attend classes and examinations in accordance with regulations will not be given academic credit by the schools. Students who hinder the studies of the school in any way shall be strictly ordered to leave the school immediately. No groups inside or outside the school shall be allowed to incite strikes, interfere in school administration, or disrupt social order. Local military and political organs shall investigate and sanction groups found to be engaged in such incitement. These instructions are intended to protect the life of education and to increase the strength of the nation. The Ministry of Education should urge and supervise the various education halls, bureaus, and school principals and teachers. The provincial and municipal governments should urge and supervise the military and political organs under their jurisdiction to strictly implement these instructions in accordance with their respective responsibilities, without any hesitation. In order to meet the needs of the national crisis period, the education plan should be revised appropriately. The Ministry of Education should handle this matter quickly and carefully. In addition to distributing the instructions, the Executive Yuan hereby orders compliance and instructs subordinate organs to comply with these instructions as well. This order." Accordingly, the school hall and bureau are hereby ordered to comply with these instructions and to forward them to subordinate public and private schools for compliance with this order.

<h3 id="e10">Japanese Military Tribunal Tries the Nagata Assassination Case; Defendant Aizawa Testifies About the Showa Restoration; Hates Nagata's Oppression of Young Officers <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Army Military Tribunal opened the trial on the morning of the 28th (28th Allied Dispatch) at the First Division Command Headquarters in Aoyama of Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa Saburo, who assassinated Army Military Affairs Bureau Chief Nagata on August 12 last year in the Ministry of the Army, as the defendant in the crimes of assaulting a superior, murder, and injury.</p>
<p>Tokyo: The military tribunal for the trial of Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa had 25 ordinary spectators, and 100 special spectators including Supervising Director Oguri, Colonel Mutaguchi of the Staff Headquarters, etc. Behind the judges' seats, Commander of the First Division Hori, Vice Minister of the Army Okabe, Commander of the Tokyo Garrison Ka, and Investigation Department Chief Yamashita sat in the audience. After Chief Judge Sato asked about the defendant's identity, Prosecutor Shimada was about to read the indictment when special lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Mitsui suddenly spoke, saying that the preliminary trial of the defendant's case was unclear. The judicial authorities did not examine the social facts that caused the incident, that is, the fact that the army's control was disrupted by financial groups, elders, senior ministers, and bureaucrats. Also, the time of Lieutenant General Nagata's death was unclear. He hoped that the authorities would stop the public trial and investigate the truth of the above three items first. However, the chief judge rejected this proposal, and Prosecutor Shimada immediately read the indictment. Next, Judicial Officer Sugihara questioned the defendant about his beliefs and hobbies. Defendant Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa stated that the Emperor is the agent of the God who created heaven and earth, and the origin of the great universe is the Emperor's entity. There is an infinite separation between God and humanity, and there is an absolute distinction between the ruler and the people. At 11:40, the chief judge announced a recess. (28th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>The session resumed at 2:07 p.m. Judge Sugihara asked, "The defendant said he wanted to make a statement about national reform." Before he finished speaking, Aizawa interrupted him. Aizawa said that national reform was a mistake. Japan is a country that develops infinitely according to the Emperor's will, not reform. It is the Showa Restoration. The word reform is not my intention. He resolutely questioned the motive for his determination to reform the country and answered as follows: Aizawa said that he decided to dedicate himself to the Showa Restoration in Showa 45 when he was serving as an assigned officer at the Japan Gymnastics School. He deeply felt that all affairs in the country were troubling the sacred thoughts, which the subjects could not bear. Also, Judge Sugihara asked about his friendly relations regarding the Showa Restoration and the goals of its execution. Aizawa said that the purpose of life lies in eternal truth, so he does not produce concrete rights and wrongs. Those who hinder national restoration and despise the country are harmed by foreign ideas. The chief judge asked about the fundamental ideas of his determination to restore the country. Aizawa replied that there were many fears that he could not speak out, so he could not say. What made me most indignant was the appearance of professional soldiers.</p>
<p>The session recessed again at 2:55 p.m. The session resumed at 3:15 p.m. After Aizawa supplemented his explanation of the Showa Restoration, the chief judge urged Aizawa to state his observations on the situation in his department after he took office as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Aizawa replied that shortly after Nagata took office as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, he suppressed the comrade officers in Tokyo. Our belief in the execution of the restoration was prevented. I believe that this action is a premise for contacting Generals Ugaki and Minami and catering to the political ambitions of elders, senior ministers, new bureaucrats, political parties, and financial groups. I thought that the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau should guide young officers, but he suppressed them. As a result of the pain and anger, I paid attention to the movements of the leadership. I realized that Nagata was colluding with impure forces from outside to suppress the efforts of the restoration. The defendant answered this, very sad and angry. He continued to answer that Nagata framed his comrades with certain incidents, demoted Director-General Masaki, and criticized the actions of young officers at the time with certain incidents as the center. At the same time, he also stated his opinions on the handling of the central department. The judge resolutely asked about the source of the information about the cause of the crime, saying that, in short, the defendant mainly listened to the words of Okura and Nishida in Tokyo and decided on his state of mind towards Director Nagata based on various experiences he had gained himself? Aizawa admitted it and said that the previous central department was closely related to us. It is truly regrettable after the fact.</p>
<p>Then the chief judge announced the suspension of the interrogation and decided that the public trial would continue on the morning of the 30th. The court adjourned at 3:48 p.m. (28th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>

After negotiations between the Hebei-Chahar authorities, Chen Juesheng, Chen Zhongfu, and the Japanese side, and contact with the Eastern Hebei side, the matter has been completely resolved. In addition to continuing the previous agreement to provide the Eastern Hebei government with 250,000 yuan in salt tax per month, the salt produced in the two salt marshes will be transported as usual. The Tanggu-Tianjin section of the Beining Railway has been very busy transporting salt in recent days. (Special dispatch dated the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Crisis and Unity <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu Hanmin returned from Europe, the entire nation welcomed him. The crisis is so severe now that the party members and the people of the country have high expectations for Mr. Hu. Therefore, their welcome was very sincere. According to recent news, Mr. Hu has agreed to arrive in Nanjing from Hong Kong at the beginning of next month to assume the position of Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee. At this time, public opinion is abuzz with discussions, and the political situation north of the Yellow River is completely different. The possibility of a major international war is greater than at any time since 1919. Mr. Hu resolutely comes north to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the central government and lead the people to seek a way out. This is truly a good sign of unity and saving the nation.</p>
<p>Looking at various nations in times of crisis and survival, there are always two or three leaders who bravely step forward to guide the people and prevent the destruction of a race or a country. The unification of Italy, breaking away from the oppression of Austria and creating the glory of a new Rome, was due to the efforts of the three heroes: Cavour, Garibaldi, and Mazzini. The independence of the United States, breaking away from the rule of England and laying the foundation for the United States of America, was due to the efforts of Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton. The success of the Russian Revolution and the progress of nation-building were due to the three leaders: Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin. And France was able to overcome its difficulties during the European War mainly due to the efforts of Clemenceau, Poincaré, and Briand. These nation-building leaders mostly had different ideas and beliefs. Garibaldi was a military man, Cavour was a politician, and the two were often incompatible and indulged in their own opinions. However, Garibaldi eventually abandoned his prejudices and handed over southern Italy to the unified Italian government. Jefferson and Hamilton were one a proponent of decentralization and the other a proponent of centralization, and they attacked each other and could not compromise. Thanks to Washington's proper coordination, one was in charge of foreign affairs and the other in charge of finance, each working hard for the new country. As for Trotsky and Stalin in Soviet Russia, their political differences were too great to allow them to cooperate. During the European War, the three major French politicians were also at odds with each other, but they all made significant contributions to their country.</p>
<p>The leadership of the new Chinese politics lies with the Chinese Nationalist Party, and since the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, and Wang Jingwei have been publicly recognized as the most prestigious and capable leaders in the party. In the past, the three leaders have also been unable to get along due to differences in opinions, with someone leaving and someone else taking over in rotation. This has happened many times, and each change has made us realize the necessity of unity and cooperation among the leaders. The success of party rule depends on the proper guidance of the leaders, and Chiang, Wang, and Hu each have their strengths in military affairs, party affairs, and politics, and none can be neglected. The difference in their political views is not comparable to that between Jefferson and Hamilton, and the difference in their personalities is even less like that between Cavour and Garibaldi. Moreover, they all shared hardships with Mr. Sun, and their past work was aimed at fulfilling Mr. Sun's legacy. At this time, the national crisis has entered its most urgent stage, and no one can avoid the feeling that it is difficult to support a collapsing building with a single beam. Now that Mr. Hu has decided to go to Nanjing to take office, and it is said that Mr. Wang will also go to the capital to serve as soon as his injuries are slightly better, if the three can sincerely cooperate and jointly seek to save the current crisis, then this will not only be a sign of the great unity of the Nationalist Party, but also a glimmer of hope for the future of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e44">US House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes New Neutrality Bill; Original Bill Slightly Amended <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Washington The House Foreign Affairs Committee today passed the government's neutrality bill and submitted it to the House. The bill stipulates a mandatory ban on the export of munitions and allows the president to decide whether to ban the export of wartime materials beyond the normal needs of the importing country. The bill also contains a provision prohibiting loans or credit to belligerent countries. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington The House Foreign Affairs Committee today passed the neutrality bill but deleted the clause giving the president the power to prohibit the export of goods that he deems would prolong the war if not prohibited. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee stated that the bill will be submitted to the House in the middle of this week or early next week. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is still unable to reconcile its opinions on the bill, because Senators Borah and Johnson are vigorously advocating for more powerful guarantees of freedom of the seas. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington The House Foreign Affairs Committee has completed a report on the new neutrality bill proposed by Committee Chairman McReynolds, and has slightly amended the original bill. The main points of the report are: The provisions of the new neutrality bill should not be applied to Central and South American countries when wars occur between them and countries outside the Americas. The export of medicines and food to belligerent countries should be prohibited, as determined by the president. Americans who violate the new neutrality law and lend short-term or long-term loans to belligerent countries will be imprisoned or fined $50,000. If the content of treaties signed between the United States and other countries conflicts with the new neutrality law, the president should negotiate with the countries concerned before changing the treaties. If these negotiations fail, the president may declare the treaty abolished. The new neutrality law should be implemented as soon as the treaty expires. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Chicago The United States, from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast, is almost entirely covered in ice. The Arctic cold has been felt for a week. Since Wednesday, 235 people have frozen to death. Ohio has the highest number of deaths, with 47 people. Waterways in Ohio are all frozen, and transportation is completely blocked, which has not happened since 1918. The famous Niagara Falls has been frozen for three days now, which is unprecedented. The cold weather in the Midwestern states has broken all 20th-century records. The cold wave is now in its second week and is expected to continue for three more days. Only Florida and the Pacific coast have slightly warmer climates. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>New York Temperatures east of the Rocky Mountains have been below zero degrees for six days. There have been numerous deaths in the affected areas, and efforts are being made to alleviate the suffering of the people. An Associated Press reporter learned today that the cold wave has severely affected the Southeast, with at least 230 people frozen to death. Furthermore, there are concerns about coal shortages in Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois, which is exacerbating the disaster. Coal sales have increased sharply due to the continued severe cold, and all coal stocks have been sold out, resulting in coal production failing to meet demand. The number of deaths in each state is as follows: Ohio 48, Pennsylvania 29, Illinois 28, New York 19, Michigan 16, Wisconsin 12, Minnesota 11, Iowa 7, Kentucky 7, Massachusetts 7, Indiana 26, West Virginia 5, Alabama, Connecticut, Nebraska, Texas, and Kansas, one each, Missouri 3, Maine 2.

<h3 id="e46">Ten Thousand Spectators Line the Streets of London; Former King George Laid to Rest; Cannons and Church Bells Resound Together; Procession Takes One Hour to Pass <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>London Starting from 9 p.m. last night, all the main streets in London that the hearse would pass through were already occupied. Some people spread newspapers on the sidewalks and lay down to wait for dawn, while others gathered under the eaves. Some even brought cots to the street corners. Fortunately, the rain had stopped, and the weather was still mild at night. Pedestrians kept coming and going all night, but it was extremely quiet and orderly. By 5 a.m. this morning, the streets were packed with people. The windows and doors of various residences in the Oxford and Cambridge areas were removed and bleachers were built. All organizations were decorated with black and purple, black to express mourning and purple because the royal color is purple.</p>
<p>The crowds lining the streets along the route of the hearse were silent. Men took off their hats with sad expressions, and women mostly wore mourning clothes, standing with their heads bowed. Compared with the scene last year when celebrating the 25th anniversary of the king's accession to the throne, when every household hung flags and everyone cheered, the contrast between joy and sorrow is truly stark. The flagpoles used to hang flags in the streets during last year's celebration were erected again today, but they were all hung with mourning flags trimmed with black ropes.</p>
<p>Those crowding the windows, balconies, and specially built bleachers were all dressed in black. In Hyde Park, 600 British soldiers holding sixty flags and soldiers from other countries gave the final salute as the hearse passed. Soldiers were lined up on both sides of the streets. Behind the hearse, in addition to eight carriages carrying British and foreign royal ladies, the pallbearers all walked on foot. The Queen Mother sat in the first carriage.</p>
<p>As the hearse approached Marble Arch, the crowds became too dense and broke through the police line. With the help of auxiliary police, the police were still unable to make the crowd retreat. After the cavalry drove them away, the police line was restored. The commotion lasted for several minutes, and at least dozens of men and women were injured and sent to the hospital. When the hearse arrived, the police quickly used loudspeakers to ask the people behind not to push forward anymore. This move was very effective, and order was restored. As the procession passed Marble Arch, a sudden rain shower fell, but it cleared up quickly.</p>
<p>The hearse traveled safely all the way to Paddington Station. According to Reuters reporters, since this morning, there has been no space on the streets and sidewalks. The police ordered women carrying young children to stand in the front row. The order of the crowds everywhere was good, except for Marble Arch, where the overcrowding caused many people to faint. According to statistics, 800 people were treated at nearby first aid stations.</p>
<p>At 9:20 a.m., King Edward of England and his three brothers entered Westminster Abbey. At 9:30 a.m., cannons boomed, mixed with the sounds of church bells. The procession then set off in succession at 9:49 a.m. At this time, the sun broke through the clouds, and the coffin was covered with the royal flag. The procession paused twice as it approached the corner of Hyde Park.</p>
<p>London's commerce was temporarily suspended at this time, and almost all Londoners gathered at the locations along the procession route. It was as if the city was empty. Except for a slight setback at Marble Arch, everything proceeded in order. After one hour and eight minutes, the entire procession had passed. Prime Minister Baldwin did not serve as a pallbearer and follow along. He had already gone to Windsor with several cabinet members and foreign representatives. As the special train carrying the coffin passed over the Thames River Bridge, the Tower of London began to ring its bell, once per minute, for a total of 101 times. According to custom, the bell of this tower is only rung when the monarch is laid to rest. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Windsor The mourning decorations here today are the same as in London. Soldiers were densely deployed on both sides of the station and on the main road leading to St. George's Chapel. Spectators were packed like a wall, all standing quietly behind the soldiers. In the early morning, important people such as cabinet members arrived in Windsor. The special train carrying the coffin did not arrive until 1:08 p.m., 33 minutes later than scheduled. It was said that the procession was slightly delayed due to the crowds of spectators, which caused the train to be unable to depart on time. After the special train arrived, the coffin was immediately carried down and moved onto a gun carriage, leaving the station at 1:01 p.m. King Edward of England walked behind with his head bowed. Mountains of wreaths were piled up in St. George's Chapel. After the coffin was carried into the church, King Edward stood in front of the coffin, the Queen Mother to his right, and the royal family behind them. Then, a hymn was sung, and the coffin was carried into the tomb and slowly lowered into the grave. King Edward stepped forward and sprinkled soil from the grave onto the coffin. Then, there was a silent pause of two minutes. The time was 2:10 p.m., 40 minutes later than scheduled. After the silence, the national anthem was sung, and a prayer of blessing was performed. After the ceremony, King Edward and the Queen Mother slowly walked out of the church, took a car to the train station, and returned to London. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Glimpse of the Funeral Procession: Escorted by Six Kings and Twenty-Seven Princes, Thirty-Three Envoys <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The funeral ceremony of the late King George V of London was held this morning, a spectacle rarely seen in Britain. The coffin departed from Westminster Hall and proceeded to Paddington Station for transport to Windsor for burial. Besides the full military honors, six kings (including King Edward VIII), twenty-seven princes, thirty-three ambassadors or ministers, and fifty detachments of troops from various countries accompanied the procession. Crowds in mourning attire stood solemnly along the streets the procession was scheduled to pass from early morning, awaiting its arrival. When the royal guards carried the late King's coffin from Westminster Hall, the crowds on both sides of the road stood silently and motionless. King Edward VIII and his three brothers arrived at the church around 9:45 AM. The honor guard, composed of soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, saluted the King. Subsequently, artillerymen placed the late King's coffin on a gun carriage. The King was dressed in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet, his brothers the Duke of York in the uniform of an Air Force officer of the Royal Air Force, the Duke of Gloucester in the uniform of a Colonel of the Hussars, and the Duke of Kent in the uniform of a naval officer. The coffin was draped with a gold and red royal standard, adorned with red and white roses offered by Queen Mary. At that moment, Hyde Park began firing salutes, which lasted for seventy minutes. As soon as the salutes began, the funeral procession formed into line according to the predetermined order. When the hearse set off, the radio station immediately broadcast the signal, which was relayed by the police, and the entire procession began to move. The weather this morning was originally gloomy, but at this moment it suddenly cleared up, and the sun shone brightly. As for the order of the procession, it was led by a staff officer, followed by dozens of British troops and thirty-one detachments of foreign troops. Next came a staff officer, naval officers, and a band. The Duke of Norfolk, the Minister in charge of funeral arrangements, led the royal officials and courtiers following the band. Then came the hearse, drawn by 142 naval sailors, followed by a court attendant carrying the royal standard. King Edward walked behind, with a sorrowful expression, followed by his brothers and royal relatives, including King Haakon III of Norway (the late King's brother-in-law), Crown Prince Olav of Norway, and Count Helhuth (the late King's son-in-law). Next came President Lebrun of France, King Christian of Denmark, and King Carol of Romania, the three heads of state walking abreast. Further back were other princes, such as Crown Prince Umberto of Italy, Crown Prince Charles of Sweden, Crown Prince Paul of Greece, Austrian Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg, and Regent Paul of Yugoslavia, all following the heads of state. Queen Mary, Queen Maud of Norway (the late King's sister), the Duchess of York (the late King's daughter-in-law), and Princess Helhuth rode in black carriages drawn by brown horses. Behind them were diplomatic envoys from various countries and representatives of the autonomous territories, as well as seven royal carriages carrying the former Queen of Spain, the Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess of Kent, and Princess Connaught (the daughter of the late King's eldest sister). Finally came the delegations from various countries and a detachment of the Royal Guards. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The late King George V of London was buried today, and the Chinese government specially sent its ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, to represent the country in escorting the coffin. The Japanese government sent its ambassador to France, Saito, to participate. Both Chinese and Japanese ambassadors walked with the heads of government of various countries following the coffin.

<p>The funeral ceremony of the former King George V of London will be held today with the honor befitting an Admiral of the Navy. At 9:45 AM this morning, the hearse will depart from Westminster Abbey. At that time, the entire city will be in complete silence. The only sounds to break the silence will be the salutes from Hyde Park and the Tower of London, and the sound of tens of thousands of people escorting the coffin. The gold coffin will be placed on a gun carriage, drawn by the navy, and will travel approximately four miles through the streets of London to Paddington Station. Then, the gold coffin will be transferred to a special train to Windsor. Following the gun carriage on foot will be the new King Edward, followed by the British royal family and foreign royal family members. The Queen Mother will follow in a carriage. The foreign monarchs walking and escorting the coffin will include the monarchs of Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, and Romania. Preceding the gun carriage will be army and navy troops, stretching for a mile. The troops will march with their rifles reversed. Following the troops will be high-ranking officials from various departments, as well as military bands and flute bands. When the hearse departs from Westminster Abbey, Hyde Park and the Tower of London will fire salutes, one every minute, until the hearse reaches Paddington Station. It is estimated that the journey will take two hours. After the special train arrives at Windsor Station, the gold coffin will be transferred to another gun carriage and taken to St. George's Chapel for burial. Whenever the gold coffin is moved, the flute band will play music. When the burial ceremony is completed, the entire nation will observe two minutes of silence. There will be many spectators along the route taken by the hearse. The authorities have made arrangements in advance, and all streets along the route will be closed to traffic from 8:00 AM. The cinemas will open at 6:00 PM, and it is expected that major cinemas will screen new films of today's funeral ceremony. Last night, Windsor Palace received approximately 1,500 wreaths from all over the world, from monarchs to ordinary people. Among them were those sent by our country's emperors, such as the Japanese Emperor, the Italian King, the Afghan King, and the deposed German Emperor, which were exquisitely crafted and showed the utmost skill of the florists. Last night, the Queen Mother also visited Westminster Abbey and stood beside the coffin for several minutes, accompanied by members of the British royal family and foreign royal relatives. While the Queen Mother and others were in the abbey, public viewing was temporarily suspended. The monarchs of Denmark and Belgium, the President of France, and the three or four princes of Sweden, Italy, and Greece all arrived in England yesterday, and were welcomed by British officials. On the last day of public viewing, mourners continued to arrive in an endless stream. Despite the rain all day, the crowds did not diminish. At one point, those standing along the route waiting to enter the abbey reached three miles in length, so the abbey doors did not close until 4:00 AM this morning. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

After the meal, the British Emperor changed into the uniform of the Guards and visited Westminster Abbey at midnight. His three younger brothers accompanied him, standing guard around the gold coffin for half an hour before leaving. At that time, the public was allowed to enter the room to pay their respects, walking around the coffin, but they did not know that the guards were the British Emperor and his three brothers. The British Emperor and others were all wearing the uniform of the Guards, so the public thought they were the honor guard. The viewing was closed at 4:00 AM this morning, and it was estimated that a total of 809,182 people had paid their respects. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Greek Elections Revealed: No Party Obtains an Absolute Majority <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Athens: The Ministry of the Interior has recently announced the results of the House of Representatives elections. The distribution of seats among the various parties is as follows:</p>
<p>* The Liberal Party, led by former Prime Minister Sophoulis (formerly led by former Prime Minister Venizelos), 34 seats.</p>
<p>* The People's Party, led by former Prime Minister Tsaldaris, 65 seats.</p>
<p>* The Coalition Party, led by General Gondylis (who defected from the People's Party) and former Minister of Agriculture Diadokos, 60 seats.</p>
<p>* A faction of the Liberal Party, led by former Ambassador to Italy Metaxas, 7 seats.</p>
<p>* The Republican Party, led by Papanastasiou, 12 seats.</p>
<p>* The Communist Party, 16 seats.</p>
<p>* The right-wing Royalist Party, led by Gotzamanis, 4 seats.</p>
<p>In addition, 12 seats have not yet been announced. None of the above parties has obtained an absolute majority. It is generally believed that a national coalition cabinet is likely to be formed. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Athens: The final results of yesterday's general election for the House of Representatives will not be announced until Wednesday of this week. The leader of the Liberal Party, former Prime Minister Sophoulis (the assistant of former Prime Minister Venizelos), told this agency's reporter that the party has won 132 seats out of the new House of Representatives' 300 seats. He expressed great satisfaction with this result. The Liberal Party will occupy the most seats in the new House of Representatives, so it is expected that King George II will order him to form a new cabinet. However, he hopes that the leaders of the People's Party, such as former Prime Minister Tsaldaris, will provide assistance because "a strong government must be established to deal with the current problems." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Athens: Prime Minister Demetzis told reporters that the number of seats held by the Royalist and Republican parties is almost equal, so the election results make it difficult for the new government to have a majority. Although important political leaders, such as Venizelos, Tsaldaris, and Metaxas, are willing to jointly form a new government, it is not known whether this kind of cooperation can agree on the normal procedures, because it has now become an open secret that even the two Royalist leaders sometimes have different opinions. Therefore, the current government's Royalist Party itself must also unify its opinions. Regarding the criticism of this situation, Prime Minister Demetzis said that even if one of the parties occupies the majority of the seats, the organization of a national coalition cabinet is inevitable, because only this kind of coalition cabinet can solve problems such as amending the constitution, uniting military forces, etc. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Paris: The French newspaper "L'Avant-Garde" claimed today that Germany has secretly laid out a "Hindenburg Line in the Air" in the demilitarized zone of the Rhine River bank, preparing for a "second invasion of France." The newspaper detailed that the newest airfields in that area all have bomb-proof underground hangars, each hangar capable of holding hundreds of aircraft. This line stretches from the North Sea to the Swiss border, and there is a second line, also of similar airfields, whose location is suitable for providing strategic retreat for the first line. Every week, the cities along the Rhine River have a certain time when the entire city is blacked out so that residents can conduct air defense drills. And the German army, disregarding the prohibition of the Treaty of Versailles, often parades in the cities. The largest air force concentration is near Stuttgart, which shows that "the second invasion will pass through Lorraine and northern Switzerland." (National News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Ethiopian Capital: According to official sources from this agency's special correspondent, Audrina Panzani, after repeatedly losing various positions in the Danbian area between the 20th and 23rd of this month, the Italian army in the north is still trying to recapture the lost territory. The Ethiopian army, on the other hand, is constantly harassing the Italian defense line, with the main purpose of cutting off the transportation line between the cities of Magale and Adwa in the hopes of forcing the Italian army to withdraw from Magale, but it has not yet succeeded. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Mogadishu: According to news reporters arriving here today from the southern front, Italian Somali commander General Graziani can dispatch troops to encircle the Ethiopian capital within ten days, but whether Graziani is able to hold his position and prevent the Ethiopian army from destroying his transportation line is quite questionable. However, the terrain is advantageous for the Italian army's offensive. A battle report released today claimed that General Graziani's troops have now occupied Udalara, southeast of the Ethiopian capital. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">U.S. Silver Purchase Policy Fails; Britain Eager to Promote the Weakening of Silver's Position <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The leader of the silver faction in the House of Representatives stated today that they have abandoned the hope of passing any bills in this congressional session that would enhance the status of silver. Democratic Congressman Martin said that silver faction members may soon hold a meeting to discuss this matter, but he fears that there will be no practical results. Martin believes that the failure of the Treasury Department's silver purchase policy is due to the cool attitude of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. If the Secretary does not allow Britain to deceive him, the status of silver will not be as it is today. If he could have declared to Britain that the Treasury Department would purchase silver as much as possible, then Britain's anti-silver propaganda would not have materialized. China and India have both been incited by Britain. Britain has been opposing silver for 120 years. Therefore, after the United States implemented the silver purchase policy, Britain has tried every possible means to weaken the status of silver and reduce the exchange rate of the gold pound against Asian currencies in order to establish a connection between the gold pound and Far Eastern currencies. At the same time, it uses a balancing fund to secure its domestic currency price. A few days after the United States stopped purchasing silver, the silver purchase policy was irreversible.

<p>Washington: Alfred Smith, who competed with Roosevelt in 1928 for the Democratic presidential nomination but failed, has become the leader of the Democratic Party's right wing today because of the fierce criticism of the current government's policies in his speech to the American Liberty League on Saturday. Political circles here are speculating today that Smith may compete with President Roosevelt for the presidential nomination before or during the party election, or may create a movement against Roosevelt and Garner at the party convention. Moreover, in recent times, there have indeed been various signs of anti-Roosevelt sentiment in the Democratic Party's right wing. However, based on today's situation, it is still unknown whether the elements that severely criticize President Roosevelt's performance will follow Smith to unite and oppose Roosevelt. But the environment in which the Democratic Party finds itself today is indeed the same as the Democratic Party in 1896, that is, there is a force within it that firmly wants to raise the silver price to a ratio of 1 to 16, while another faction opposes it. President Bryan leaned toward the silver faction, calling for free silver coinage, which resulted in an unprecedented defeat. And Roosevelt's current situation is very similar to this, so the magnitude of the crisis is self-evident. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: Alfred Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential candidate, strongly criticized the current government, saying that the Roosevelt government has now become socialist rather than democratic. This has aroused a response from Interior Secretary Ickes today. Ickes delivered an informal public speech, advocating the creation of a long-term public works program to save unemployment and refuting Smith's claim. Ickes said that Smith himself was once labeled a socialist by his political opponent, Hoover. Hoover claimed during the 1928 election that Smith and his Democratic platform advocated socialism. This kind of attack is completely unfounded. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Washington: The U.S. Senate today overturned the President's veto of the veterans' bonus bill by a vote of 76 to 19. The bill will immediately become law, and the 15-year struggle of European War veterans to immediately pay their bonus bonds in cash has also succeeded. The majority in the Senate overriding the President's veto was not much different from the 79 votes that passed the original bill, which is the biggest decision failure since the President took office in 1933. A similar bill was also passed in the last Congress. After the President's veto, the Senate had passed a resolution in favor of the President's veto. Today, the situation has completely reversed, which shows not only that the pressure of propaganda for this bill this year is significant, but also that the point of contention over currency inflation is imminent. It is reported that the Treasury Department has begun preparing to print bonds to pay the bonus, with a face value of $50 per bond, but they will not be issued until June 16th. These bonds are scheduled to mature in 1945, but can be redeemed at any time. If all the bonds are completely redeemed, the government must prepare 2,237 million yuan in cash. It is not yet certain how this huge sum will be raised today. It is likely that it will be raised by increasing national debt, implementing new taxes, or inflating the currency. The original bill proposed by Harrison did not specify a fundraising method. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">The French Sarraut Cabinet Is Bound to Win Parliamentary Confidence and Will Announce Its Policies on Thursday <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Paris: It is generally believed that when the Sarraut Cabinet first attends the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday, it will be able to gain confidence, and the number of votes it receives will be much more than expected. There is no question that the Radical Socialist Party and the parties in the center will vote in favor. As for the hundred or so right-wing parliamentarians, they will inevitably vote against it. Although the parliamentarians of the Republican Democratic Union, led by former Minister without Portfolio Marran, decided this afternoon to decide on their position after Sarraut announced his policy guidelines, it seems that there is no name for them to oppose the cabinet. As for the Socialist Party's attitude, it is divided into two factions, one faction is preparing to assist the Sarraut Cabinet to celebrate the overthrow of the Laval Cabinet, and the other faction is hesitant due to local political views. This is because some of the cabinet members who belong to the moderate faction are political enemies that they attacked in the electoral district. According to speculation in the Chamber of Deputies' lounge, the Sarraut Cabinet should be able to obtain 350 votes in favor, and at most 250 votes against. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to today's newspapers, the new cabinet will announce the following policies in the Senate and the House of Representatives on Thursday: 1. Uphold peace, maintain France, and protect the Republic. 2. Plan economic recovery and relieve unemployment. Political circles believe that Premier Sarraut's so-called "uphold peace" means France's loyalty to the League of Nations and its love for the group security policy. This policy also includes the main work of the cabinet, which is to ensure that the future election is not affected by any riots.</p>
<p>The "Paris" newspaper claimed that Finance Minister Regnier wants to borrow 2 million francs from London before the election to enrich the treasury. The newspaper also said that Finance Minister Regnier believes that if no special accidents occur, the French treasury can still be maintained for several months without borrowing foreign debts. "L'Observateur" and "Le Parisien" both claimed that the cabinet decided at yesterday's meeting that if the government fails in Congress on Thursday, it will immediately dissolve Congress.

<p>Washington – According to what our reporter has learned, the U.S. Department of Commerce is currently planning to build two super mail ships to navigate the Atlantic Ocean, aiming to surpass France's "Normandie" and Britain's "Queen Mary."

Details about the characteristics of these mail ships are still difficult to ascertain. However, judging from the published draft plans, the new ship's design will emphasize streamlining. This plan was jointly developed by experts in automobile, aircraft, and shipbuilding. Although the construction method is very innovative, there is one aspect that may be disliked by those who travel the Atlantic: although there are devices to regulate the airflow and temperature within the ship, all cabins are completely sealed on all sides, and there are no decks along the ship's sides. As for the dining halls and public living spaces, although they have windows, they do not open, so there is no concern about sea breezes entering. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Shandong, in ancient times, was the land of Qi and Lu, the home of sages and worthies, with many famous scenic spots and historical sites. The most prominent of these, such as the Confucius Cemetery in Qufu, Mount Tai in Tai'an, and the Three Wonders of Jinan, are all located along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. The Confucius Cemetery is located three li north of Qufu city, with ancient cypress trees lining the road, captivating visitors. Confucius' tomb is fifteen feet high and forty steps in circumference, with towering cypresses and a solemn atmosphere. There is a stele that reads "Tomb of the Perfectly Accomplished Sage, King Wenxuan." Within the city is also the Confucius Temple, with majestic and magnificent halls adorned with brilliant colors. The stone pillars in the Dacheng Hall are carved with dragons, baring their teeth and brandishing their claws, protruding five or six inches, their postures seemingly about to move. The three cypress trees that Confucius personally planted, one of which is in the southeast corner of the Apricot Altar, are known as the Reborn Cypress. Records state that it withered in the third year of Yongning during the Jin Dynasty and revived in the first year of Yining during the Sui Dynasty. It withered and flourished several times thereafter. During the fifteenth year of Hongzhi in the Ming Dynasty, it was again destroyed by fire, leaving only the trunk. New branches grew in the tenth year of Yongzheng during the Qing Dynasty and still exist today. The reporter once visited this place and saw that the new branches were replanted. The remaining trunk, damaged by fire, is covered with a glass罩 to prevent it from decaying. Mount Tai is one of the Five Sacred Mountains, with pine trees, clouds, springs, rocks, perilous cliffs, and secluded ravines, each possessing its own unique characteristics, inspiring admiration. The highest peak is called the Peak of Viewing the Sun. At dawn, one can witness the sunrise. As the sun emerges, the rosy glow is magnificent. The earlier one sees the sun, the more extraordinary the view. Therefore, those who climb Mount Tai must witness the sunrise to their heart's content. Currently, some disaster victims reside in the temples at the foot of the mountain, numbering 4,000 from the entire county. They are all allocated from disaster areas such as Juancheng County. Food rations are distributed based on acreage, with six liang levied per mu per month, accumulating over time to a considerable amount. Women are sometimes abducted and flee, and men also request to become monks or Daoists. The shelter strictly prohibits them from entering and leaving freely, and they sing storytelling ballads to pass the time. According to investigations, there are a total of eighty-eight cities and counties in Shandong Province that have established shelters for disaster victims, accommodating over 340,000 people. However, there are still 1.8 million people registered and awaiting relief who are without clothing or food. As the ancients said, "A people's hunger is like one's own hunger, and a people's drowning is like one's own drowning." As human beings with round heads and strong feet, we have a natural duty to help and assist each other. Wealthy people who live in comfort and luxury should not isolate themselves and abandon their rightful duty. The Three Wonders of Jinan—Daming Lake, Thousand Buddha Mountain, and Baotu Spring—I had visited several times in the past. This time, upon alighting from the train, I visited them again. Daming Lake is located in the northwest corner of the city, covering dozens of acres. The lake water does not freeze in winter (the Yellow River freezes thick in winter, allowing passage for vehicles, because of its long course and cold nature). It is as clear as a mirror. In summer, lotus leaves dance in the wind, and lotus flowers bloom in the sun, presenting a scene of boundless green connecting to the sky and thousands of reds emerging from the water. The temples and pavilions include the Lixia Pavilion, Beiji Pavilion, Huiquan Temple, Baihua Causeway, and the ancestral halls of Zhang, Tie, Zeng, and Li. Currently, many disaster victims also reside in the ancestral halls, suffering from cold and hunger. From the west city gate, one can reach the Beiji Pavilion by walking on the city wall road (commonly known as the Ring City Road, accessible by cars), passing through the northwest castle, where there is a pavilion with no plaques or couplets. However, one feels a hidden radiance of blood, said to commemorate the achievements of defending the city during the May Third Incident, symbolizing the intention to deeply engrave it in one's heart. Thousand Buddha Mountain is located two or three li south of the city, with lush pines and cypresses, and a serene and secluded landscape. Ascending hundreds of stone steps, one reaches the mountain temple. The disaster victims who lived in the temple have just been moved elsewhere. If one climbs higher, the view expands, offering an unobstructed view of the Yellow River and the cityscape. Baotu Spring is, like Daming Lake, a scenic spot in the city. In "Travels of Lao Can," Jinan is described as "every household with spring water, every door with willows," captivating readers with the beauty of the city's forests and springs. There are countless springs in Jinan, but only seventy-two are famous, with Baotu Spring being the foremost. Baotu Spring has two or three large springs (previously only three large springs) gushing out of the ground, overturning the pond water, reaching a foot or so high, with jade-like splashes and jumping pearls, resembling glittering stars and precious pagodas. Currently, the spring is being converted into tap water, using the original large spring in the West Pond and drilling three small springs in the East Pond to provide viewing for tourists. However, the scenery and layout have changed, and the original South Pond, Pearl Spring, resembling hanging grapes or broken strands of pearls, each rolling and floating on the water, was truly beautiful. Unfortunately, this time when I visited, it had been buried by the tap water reservoir. The north and south of the spring are marketplaces, lined with shops selling various goods. Although there are many tourists, there are very few customers. Many of the male disaster victims mingle among them, some with their hands tied behind their backs, wandering aimlessly, others staring at the market stalls, standing for a long time without leaving, with sunken eyes and a dull gaze, their clothes not warm enough, although there are no white cloth strips marking them, one can tell what kind of people they are. Some of the disaster victims live in the provincial government, originally allocated from the chairman's office building, receiving relatively comprehensive relief. They are regularly given the opportunity to watch a play once a week, which is greatly envied by the local poor. However, the disaster victims themselves do not sincerely wish to live as dependents, and their daily lives from the fields are contented with adhering to old ways. As the saying goes, "A golden nest, a silver nest, can't compare to one's own poor nest." Now that the breach has not been closed, there is no prospect of returning home, and their inner anxiety and suffering are truly unimaginable by others.</p>
<p>6.  The Yellow River Breach and Closing the Breach</p>
<p>The upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River rush through mountain valleys, carrying mud and sand. In the lower reaches, they are deposited everywhere. Shandong is located in the lowermost reaches of the Yellow River. As the river flows lower, it becomes more winding and prone to siltation, making the river channel from the border of Hebei to the sea, over 800 li long, almost impossible to defend step by step. It is generally considered a dangerous engineering site. This is truly another great threat facing Shandong, and a serious problem awaiting fundamental remediation. Last July, due to heavy rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the water level rose, the river channel was shallow, and the levees were not strong. For various reasons, six breaches occurred in the southern levee at Dongzhuang in Juancheng, The water flowed from west to east. The first to fourth breaches were quickly silted up, with a total width of 430 meters. The fifth and sixth breaches merged into one, with a width exceeding 1,800 meters. The amount of water flowing out of the breach was initially 60% of the total river flow, then increased to 80%, and recently increased to 99%. Because the terrain outside the dike is lower than the riverbed, the water flows downwards without any obstruction. Therefore, the main river channel below the breach is becoming increasingly shallow.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the breach, the total river flow reached 14,000 cubic meters per second. By winter, it had dropped to only 1,000 cubic meters per second. The amount flowing down the main river channel was less than 10 cubic meters per second, with a depth of only one meter (equivalent to just over one chi) and a width of twenty meters. If left to its natural course, there is a risk of it drying up completely. The water overflowing from the breach flooded seventeen counties in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. If the breach-closing project is delayed, the disaster area may expand further. The loss, calculated solely based on regular and miscellaneous tax revenue in western Shandong, has already sharply decreased by 7.4 million yuan. The total value of other public and private property that has been submerged is more than ten or a hundred times that amount. Regarding the breach-closing project, first, the Jiangsu dam was extended into the river to shift the flow northward. Also, dredging and guiding water work was done at the silted corner inside the main river channel, using the backflow force of the dam head to scour the bay and recover some of the floodwater. Then, another diversion canal was dug along the main river channel, and the new dike of the Jiangsu dam was extended to the riverbank. Waiting for the ice flood period to arrive, the force of the ice water rise will be used to pick up the flow and introduce it into the main river channel, reducing the breach floodwater. Before the flood season, arrangements will be made to close the eastern and western dams. Currently, more than 3,000 disaster victims are engaged in this work, which shows the immensity of the project. Therefore, on the other hand, based on the many bends in the main river channel, the high riverbed, the small flow rate, and the vastness of the breach-closing project, public opinion deeply regrets that Li Yizhi's plan to dig a diversion canal in the lower reaches was not adopted. However, in fact, it is too late to regret it. It is better to continue with the breach-closing plan, without looking back, and actively complete it. Then, a comprehensive plan can be made, the root cause can be addressed, and a complete water conservancy project can be implemented to achieve the goal of long-term peace and stability. I recall that after the great flood of the twentieth year, it was followed by the outbreak of the September 18th Incident. Last autumn, the whole country suffered another great flood, and a serious problem arose in North China. This is somewhat similar to the story of the State of Yue rising up and annexing the State of Wu during a year of severe famine in the Warring States period. We cannot ignore a major cause simply because the problem is not that simple. I believe that the government's stated goal of internal pacification, truly for the practical benefit of the nation, should prioritize actively building water conservancy and passively eradicating corruption over other tasks. Although this may seem like commonplace talk, it is still a thought-provoking argument in terms of practical needs.</p>
<p>7.  From Jinan to Beiping, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is 1,069 kilometers long. From Pukou to Jinan, 657 kilometers have already been traveled. Only 412 kilometers remain to Tianjin, and it will be reached the morning after leaving in the evening. The train departs from Jinan and quickly passes the Yellow River Railway Bridge, which is 1,300 meters long (about three Chinese li), the greatest structure on the line. If the upper reaches of the Yellow River had not breached, looking down at the turbulent waves would have broadened the traveler's mind. Now, the excessive overflow from the breach means that the flow is less than one or two percent of the original flow. The flow is slow and steady and has long since frozen over, covered with yellow dust, no different from the open fields. If traveling for the first time after the breach, without someone pointing it out, one would only see the steel beams of the railway bridge passing by through the car windows, without hearing the sound of the Yellow River rushing eastward. Few would believe that it is the famous Yellow River, and some might even feel that the railway bridge is a waste of talent and resources. There are three mountains nearby. One is Mount Que, a giant mountain with craggy rocks, lined up on the north bank of the Yellow River. From a distance, it resembles a magpie standing sideways. One is Mount Biao, located five li south of the bridge, standing tall like a landmark. One is Mount Hua, located eight or nine li east of the bridge, facing Mount Que, resembling a flower dream. Li Bai climbed and toured it and wrote the line, "How towering this mountain is, its green like a lotus flower." After passing this, one goes straight to the capital of Yan, with vast plains and an unobstructed view. Therefore, although the three mountains are not very high, they are quite eye-catching. De County (formerly Dezhou) controls the intersection of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Grand Canal. It is an important location bordering Shandong and Hebei. It has the convenience of vehicles and boats, and its commerce is thriving, serving as a major distribution center for soybeans and cotton. When the train entered the station, a military officer saw his family off on the train. According to what he said, when the rumors of North China's autonomy began to spread, this place feared that it would be taken advantage of by villains. He had paid extra attention to the issue of public safety. At the Lao Jun Tang in Sangyuan Town, north of the county, there are four ancient pine trees, with old trunks reaching the sky and green shade covering the ground, with a large iron bell hanging on one. It has a very ancient origin, said to have been carried by the Yellow River flood and suspended on the tree from afar. As the river channel has constantly shifted, such as during the reigns of King Ding of Zhou and Emperor Renzong of Song, it twice reached Tianjin to enter the sea north of the present-day Grand Canal. The Sangyuan area would be the first to bear the brunt, and the disaster of being submerged may have been even worse than the current disaster area of the breach. Therefore, the ancients implied the hanging of the bell, hoping that later generations would put their hearts into controlling the water and preventing disasters. It should not be dismissed as mere provincial chatter. After the train passes Sangyuan, it enters the border of Hebei in Cang County (Cangzhou, Changlu, all former names). The vicinity is the main production area of Hebei straw hats and whips, and the salt production is abundant, which is the Changlu salt that the world refers to. Then arriving in Tianjin, I got off the train to visit friends, and lingered for a while. Then I went to Beiping. Along the way, the plains are full of fertile wheat fields, the trees along the ridges are withering, but the sparse branches are everywhere. In the evening, as I was about to reach the old capital, I suddenly saw a fire in a residential building in the eastern suburbs, with the light shining on the city tower, fearfully burning. A gentleman in the same car, a military man from Shandong, was summoned by a fellow villager to come to Beiping to take up a job. Seeing the fire, he exclaimed with surprise, calling it a good omen for the future, and everyone around him chuckled. The markets in Beiping and Tianjin both seemed to have some anticipation due to the potential support from all sides. Therefore, after a period of turbulence, they have temporarily recovered and are in a state of harmony. However, it is impossible to predict whether this kind of superficial stability can last.</p>
<h3 id="e70">A Glimpse of Wuhu's Commercial Situation: Various Industries Turned Active Last Year, with Higher Overall Profits After Year-End Closing <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Since the completion of the Jiangnan Railway and the Jingwu Highway, both water and land transportation have become more convenient. However, the commercial market still relies on the prosperity of the rice market. Since the great flood of the twentieth year, the rice market has plummeted, and various industries have been extremely exhausted. As a result, the social economy and people's lives have all fallen into a state of difficulty. Since last summer, through the efforts of officials and civilians to prevent floods, we have passed through dangerous passes. The autumn harvest was abundant, and the rice market has slightly recovered. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the commercial market has shown signs of vitality. When the Italo-Ethiopian War broke out, the prices of foreign goods rose. The more inventory one had, the more profit one gained. At the end of the year, many had profits, and few had losses. This is a rare phenomenon in recent years. The following is an investigation into the general situation of important businesses last year.</p>
<p>Banks: There are seven banks in Wuhu: Central, China, Communications, Industrial, Shanghai, Farmers, and Anhui Local Bank. Since the elimination of money shops, the banking industry has controlled the financial hub and has been thriving. In addition, most of the transactions they engage in are collateralized loans, without the worry of bad debts, so they all have profits. The China and Communications banks can be regarded as the largest. As for money shops, only seven large and small ones remain. Their business volume is less than one or two-tenths of what it used to be. Yuankang has earned more profits by dealing in grain. Houfeng and others are just mediocre. Chengyu, which has enjoyed a long-standing reputation, has been greatly affected because a runner named Zhang embezzled millions of gold. It has not yet been decided whether it will continue to operate this year.</p>
<p>Rice Industry: The Wuhu rice market is the largest in Anhui. It is divided into the four major factions of Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo, specializing in procurement and transportation. In addition, there are more than 200 rice mills, flour mills, and rice shops. Last year, the Chaozhou faction had the most business. Ruifa, Tongxin, Changfa, Tai Lee, and other firms all earned considerable profits. The Guangdong faction did not deal in any rice. Yuanchangxing, Yongchangli, and others only dealt in soybean transactions, making slight profits. Fuhua, Yuansheng, Dongfengsheng, and other firms in the Yantai faction also made slight profits. Business was sparse for the Ningbo faction. It is rumored that Yongfenggong will close this spring.</p>
<p>Cloth Industry: There are more than 40 firms in the cloth industry that have joined the guild. In recent years, threatened by economic recession, coupled with the loosening of goods prices, they have suffered uncompensated losses. After autumn, due to the abundant harvest in rural areas, business has become slightly more active. They compete with each other, offering discounts and prizes to attract customers. Also, with the prices of goods soaring, they have gained considerable profits. Dacheng can be regarded as the leader in the retail market. Firms like Qiru, Qixing, Guangda, Changrenji, and Hongzhang have also had profits. Wholesale transactions are larger than retail transactions, so Junyixiang has made a profit of more than 50,000 gold. Huxiangfa also has more than 20,000 yuan. Others, such as Changshun and Tianxiang, although they have reduced their scale, have also earned 2,000 to 3,000 gold. Guangxiang will close or reorganize this spring due to differences among shareholders.</p>
<p>Sundries: There are more than 100 sundries shops. In recent years, those engaged in wholesale have been cautious in extending credit, so on average, they are considered stable. Business was poor in the first half of the year, and inventory could not profit. In the second half of the year, there was a sudden turnaround, and the prices of oil and sugar soared again. Tung oil rose from 32 or 33 yuan to 60 or 70 yuan, and the thickness of the profits can be imagined. Hongda, Sheng, Tongsheng, Zaishengji, Yeyueji, and others have made the most profit. However, Shan Ruifeng, a firm with decades of history, has suddenly become immobile due to excessive losses over the years and has been stranded in invisible ways, with debts of more than 120,000 yuan. Although Shan Xingwu, a shareholder of the firm, has abundant assets, it is estimated that the distribution of debts will not exceed 20%.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Cotton yarn transactions require huge capital, so statistics show that there are only a dozen cotton yarn shops in Wuhu. However, they are very united. They all gather at the guild every evening to discuss business policies, so the market price is consistent and there is never a case of indiscriminate sales. Over the years, they have all had profits and no losses for this reason. Last year, Tongchun, Baoyu, Cuishi, and Heng made the most profit. As for the only Yuzhong Textile Factory, it has suspended operations and is in liquidation due to debts of several million. The dispute over the dismissal of workers has recently been settled.

<h3 id="e71">Jiangxi Province: Commercial Situation of the Past Year – Various Industries Are in Decline and Contraction <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi's commerce last year, on the whole, was in a state of depression and contraction that had not been seen since the fifteenth year of the Republic. The economic panic and the difficulties faced by both the upper and lower classes were unprecedented. As a result, all industries had losses and no profits, and the future is quite bleak. The following is an investigation into the situation of various industries.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's commerce, in terms of exports, has plummeted in recent years. Even considering the six major special products, porcelain, ramie cloth, tea, paper, bamboo and wood, and rice, all are decreasing day by day. Eggs are a rural byproduct, and exporters of these were also losing money. Nanchang's commerce, affected by banditry, has seen a sharp fall because residents have no purchasing power. Silk fabrics, Beijing pastries, cloth, food, and other major industries, regardless of the size of the store, see few customers. The once-burgeoning travel agencies, restaurants, and military supply businesses have all been unable to sustain themselves after the departure of the large army suppressing the bandits. The money industry, the foremost of all industries, is facing the image of closure because depositors are wary, bad debts are increasing, and there is no profit to be made after the currency system reform. In the future, it is feared that only those with larger capital can make unexpected profits from lending, and the rest will be eliminated. The banking industry will dominate. Wholesale outside the county, due to the aftermath of banditry, has not recovered its vitality. Farmers are unable to make a living, and grain prices are lower than everything else. In the past, large wholesale goods in Nanchang, such as homespun cloth, white sugar, and handicrafts, are now not in demand. Either the outside counties have not recovered, or the floods are too deep, or the low grain prices hurt the farmers, and there is no commerce to speak of. From the above, Jiangxi's commerce is on the verge of total collapse. The only ones who have made a slight profit are a small number of rice, flour, and noodles.</p>
<p>In the past year, no less than hundreds of shops, large and small, have gone bankrupt. It is said that after the Lantern Festival, many will still be unable to open their doors. Because stores have always been outwardly strong but inwardly weak, a common problem. Medium-sized and large stores spend 300 to 1,000 yuan per month. Under the current low social purchasing power, daily sales, even if they do not require capital, are not enough to cope. Therefore, major stores are showing signs of financial strain, and downsizing, austerity, and rent reduction have become the consistent demands of all stores. Seeking cash and not offering credit or loans has also become a consistent and unwavering principle. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Han Fuju Appoints Cao Fulin to Suppress Liu's Bandits; Cao Immediately Leads Heavy Troops to Western Shandong; Liu's Bandits Have Already Reached Henan <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang, the well-known and fierce bandit of southern Shandong, has recently gathered one to two thousand bandits in Hebei Province, intending to disturb Shandong. He has entered Henan from Hebei and has the potential to cross the Yellow River southward. Han Fuju, upon receiving the report, had previously issued orders to the troops and militias stationed in the areas of northern and western Shandong to take strict precautions. According to reports, Liu's bandits have reached the area of Wuzhi in Henan and are being jointly suppressed by the troops stationed in Hebei and Henan provinces. Therefore, Han convened the Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, Liu Shuxiang, the Commander of the 29th Division, Cao Fulin, the Commander of the 74th Division, Li Hanzhang, and others at the provincial government at 3:00 PM on the 26th to discuss measures to prevent and suppress Liu's bandits. It was decided to appoint Cao Fulin, Commander of the 29th Division, as the general commander in charge of preventing and suppressing Liu's bandits, leading his subordinate units, the 86th Brigade commanded by Chen Dexin, and the 87th Brigade commanded by Rong Guangxing, to the area of western Shandong to prevent and suppress the bandits. In addition to those originally stationed in western Shandong, all of Cao's units stationed in Jinan have departed. Cao himself has also prepared to leave Jinan on the 28th, first going to the border of western Shandong and opportunistically intercepting them outside the province in order to resolve the issue of Liu's bandits as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e73">Songjiang: A Review of the Commercial Market Amidst the Slump <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The commercial situation in this county last year was far inferior to what it used to be, and the root cause lies in the lack of economic resources and the difficulty of circulation. Therefore, the most successful year-end collections only reached 70%, and some were less than 40%. If there had not been ample reserves in the past, it would have been difficult to maintain operations. A gloomy atmosphere enveloped the entire county. On the day that is traditionally held to welcome the God of Wealth, the Sen Tai Coal Shop in Zherunqiao closed down with a loss of more than 100,000 yuan, and more than 130 creditors became bankrupt. There were some dealings with various financial institutions, and the most substantial deposit belonged to Wang Zidong, an employee of the Chamber of Commerce, amounting to nearly 10,000. It is now estimated that the actual amount collected, considering the inventory, accounts receivable, and other factors, is unlikely to reach 10,000 yuan. Both parties are currently mediating. Zhengda Silk Shop has merged with Yida Silk Shop due to reduced business. Silk and other items are mostly luxury goods. The rice industry has seen declining rice prices, which has led to no profits for the industry. There are also some who are unwilling to continue and prefer to close down, probably several shops. However, this is still being remedied, so it has not been announced. The financial industry, including Xinyu Money Shop, pawnshops, banks, livestock money shops, and Chengda Money Shop, has seen profits due to stable operations, ranging from more than 40,000 to 10,000 gold. Zhang Yida Fan Shop, a century-old store, and Maxiechang Sundries Shop in the city have both decided to close.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Wuxi: The Truth About the Profits and Losses of the Rice and Money Industries <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>In the past few years, the money shop industry in my county has been affected by the slump in the silk industry, and has suffered huge losses from lending or pledging silk cocoons. Therefore, many have gone bankrupt. In recent years, with various banks engaged in lending, the scope of money shop operations has shrunk. Last year, Ruichangrun, Fuchangsheng, Defeng, Yuanfeng, Yonghengfeng, Fuyu, Zengda, Fuyuan, Shenyu, and other nine firms all adopted prudent policies and were able to make profits. Yonghengfeng was the best, with profits of more than 10,000 yuan. Defeng, Yuanfeng, and Shenyu each had profits of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. However, Fuchangsheng, due to the impact of bad debts from lending in previous years, the shareholders Wang Yaochen, Wang Yuqing, Xue Shentian, Yang Hanxi, and others, had no intention of operating, and decided to close down at the end of the old calendar year to collect debts. Ruichangjian Silver Shop and Fuyuan Zhuang also had no intention of operating and decided to collect debts and liquidate. Baofeng, Jufeng, and Shenghe, three rice shops in Fengtang, also announced their closure and liquidation due to losses in last year's rice market. Yuansheng, Fuxin in Sanliqiao, and Yongshun rice shops in Beizhakou are also reorganizing internally and temporarily suspending operations. Zou Chengtai, Yixin, and Fuxin, three rice mills in Jiangjianshang, are not doing well internally and will temporarily shut down their machines during the first month of the old calendar year. They are currently trying to improve and will open their machines and operate as usual in February.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Three Native Banks Announce Closure <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The native banking industry in Wuxi has always been the hub of various businesses, with as many as eighteen banks in the entire county. Since the January 28th Incident (1932), it has been affected by the decline of the rural economy and the pressure from the modern banking industry. Furthermore, the failure of silk factories has caused significant losses for the banks. Consequently, larger banks such as Bao Kang Run, Yong Ji Run, and Rui Yu have successively closed down. By last year, only eight banks including Rui Chang Run remained. After the autumn, one more bank, Zeng Da, was opened, but all banks were operating with tightened scopes and increased caution. In this year's major closure, most banks were still able to make a slight profit, with Yong Heng Feng being the best, estimating a net profit of over ten thousand yuan. However, Fu Chang Sheng, Fu Yuan, and Rui Chang Run Bank, due to too many bad debts, have no intention of continuing business and have decided to collect debts and liquidate. Yesterday, the banks that opened for business were Yong Heng Feng, Shen Yu, Fu Yu, De Feng, Yuan Feng, and Zeng Da.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Changzhou Sends Telegram Requesting Copper Coins to be Minted with Central Holes <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Wuyi Industrial Association believes that the purpose of currency is to facilitate the people, enabling swift transportation and easy inspection. After researching ancient texts, they found that coins used to have holes, hence the term "hole money" and "a string of a thousand coins." The hole in the coin was for the convenience of the people. Since the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, silver and copper coins have been minted without holes. Comparing the two, silver coins without holes, because of their higher value and smaller quantity, can be wrapped and inspected without causing inconvenience to the public. However, copper coins without holes, despite being cheap and numerous, still need to be wrapped in paper. Inspecting private coins and accurately counting them inevitably requires unwrapping and re-wrapping, which wastes paper and time, causing great inconvenience. Recently, the association read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Finance is starting to mint new decimal subsidiary coins. Therefore, the executive committee resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the newly minted one-cent and half-cent copper coins be minted with central holes. Yesterday, the telegram was sent to various departments for review and compliance.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinghu, a resident of Zhongxiao Street in the city, forged receipts at the county government's grain depot a few days ago, embezzling over eight thousand yuan of grain funds from rural villagers. Later, a villager presented the receipt to the depot to exchange for cash, and the forgery was discovered. It was immediately traced back to Zhang. Subsequently, County Magistrate Shan Ma ordered the police to arrest Zhang at the home of a prostitute named Yidianhong at No. 8 Shewei Lane in the Dizang Temple in the city. Zhang was placed in shackles and paraded through the streets. Yesterday, the county government sent police to arrest the prostitute Yidianhong, and she was interrogated by Shen Youchen, the director of land taxes. As a result, it was determined that during the current period of prostitution ban, the prostitute should not have allowed guests to stay overnight. Moreover, Zhang admitted that he had spent over forty yuan of the embezzled grain funds at the prostitute's house. Therefore, it was deemed necessary to punish the prostitute, and she was immediately detained and sent to the court along with Zhang Jinghu for handling.</p>

<p>The Xinchang-Haoba bus operated by the Haoxin Commercial Bus Company departed from Xinchang at 9:15 AM on the 27th. While traveling on a hillside about two miles from the Epu Station, the bus ran out of engine oil and could not continue uphill. The driver, Wang Deren, reversed the bus, but unfortunately, it fell into a field from a hillside over ten feet high. The bus was completely destroyed. Among the twenty-five or twenty-six passengers, two elderly women died on the spot, and over ten were seriously injured, with the rest suffering minor injuries. It was not until noon that a Westerner's car passed by and, upon seeing the situation, the occupants helped rescue the injured. They sent Zhang Pengnian, the third section chief of the Zhejiang Education Department, who suffered minor injuries, to the Sanjie Station to report the incident and dispatched another car to send the remaining injured to Zhixiang Hospital in Sheng County for treatment. Mr. Zhang arrived in Hangzhou last night for medical attention.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Unification of Chinese Geography <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Professor Zhang Qiyun, China University</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, Chinese geography has made significant progress, with many novel and gratifying achievements. The contributions from various aspects share a common theme: they all prove that our motherland is located on a complete continent and maintains a unified form. Today, our support for national sovereignty and opposition to territorial division is not only a great emotion of national consciousness but also a natural conclusion of academic research. Now, let's take a look at the main facts in human geography, biogeography, and geomorphology to illustrate this point.</p>
<p>From the perspective of human geography, the Chinese language is unified. Although various dialects exist in China, the grammar of each dialect, in terms of sentence structure, is almost the same throughout the country. For example, in Mandarin and Wu dialects, "Where are you going?" is "你到那裹去"? (Nǐ dào nà lǐ qù?). In Fujian and Guangdong dialects, it's "你去那裹"? (Nǐ qù nà lǐ?). Such small differences are already exceptions. Mr. Zhao Yuanren said, "Talking about the grammar of Chinese dialects is almost like talking about auxiliary particles." (Note 1) Chinese dialects use auxiliary particles to express the tone and attitude of certainty or doubt, and the usage varies from place to place, which is very complex. However, classical Chinese has a nationally consistent nature, and the auxiliary particles have changed very little historically. For more than three thousand years, the national language has been a natural force for uniting the Chinese nation. Not only have the sentiments of the ancients been passed down to future generations, but it also serves to maintain the hearts of the Chinese people throughout the country. The national language referred to here, of course, refers to both classical Chinese and the literary form of the national language.</p>
<p>The Han ethnic group is the foundation of the Chinese nation. The Han ethnic group is a cultural term, encompassing the large ethnic groups that have been assimilated since the beginning of history. Currently, there are still some non-Han ethnic groups in the border provinces, who speak non-Chinese languages, have lower cultures, and have not learned the national language. However, whether Chinese or non-Chinese languages, they all belong to the same language system. Centered on mainland China, extending south to the Malay Peninsula, west including Tibet and Myanmar, crossing the sea east to Taiwan, and north across the Shaan area to the upper reaches of the Yenisei River in Siberia, the languages spoken by the people in this region all belong to the monosyllable language family. Among them, they are roughly divided into four systems: Chinese, Siamese-Thai, Tibetan, and Burmese. If further combined, Chinese is related to Siamese-Thai, and Tibetan is close to Burmese. Linguists call it the Sino-Tibetan language family (Thai-Chinese, Tibeto-Burmese), or simply the Sino-Tibetan family. For example, the Yi (also known as Lolo) language is a branch of the Tibetan-Burmese language. According to Mr. Ding Wenjiang's research, the Yi script has the same origin as Chinese characters. For example, the first-person pronoun is Ma, and the word for tribe is Pu, which are the same in both Chinese and Yi languages to this day (Note 2). The Sino-Tibetan language family, also known as the Zhen-Qie language family, is the Chinese language family, and it has the following three characteristics: one character, one sound, that is, the so-called monosyllable; no word ending changes, the so-called isolating language; and the distinction between the four tones (level, rising, departing, and entering). These three characteristics are all possessed by the Chinese language family. The Japanese language, on the other hand, belongs to the agglutinative language family. Many auxiliary particles must be added between words to form the meaning of the whole, which is different from the Chinese language.</p>
<p>The excavation of the Yin Ruins in Anyang has been a major event in Chinese academia in recent years, and the underground historical materials obtained are extremely valuable. According to Mr. Li Ji's report, the tin content in the bronzes of the late Shang Dynasty was mostly above 10%, which had already reached the Bronze Age. The raw materials for copper and tin mostly relied on supply from the south. Oracle bone inscriptions not only contain the character for wheat but also the character for rice. The excavated animal bones contain the remains of water buffalo, and rice and water buffalo are both southern components. At that time, marine shellfish were also used as currency. Mr. Li said that the Yin people were able to mine gold from the southern country, capture whales in the East Sea, hunt in the north and south of the great river, and engage in conquests, writing, rites, and music. There was no one in East Asia who could compete with them, which was not a coincidence (Note 3). It can be seen that the reason why China is great lies in its ability to integrate the strengths of the north and the south from the beginning. Furthermore, Mr. Wang Guowei's research on the place names in the oracle bone inscriptions concluded that the area between Laiyi and present-day Hebei Province was still the territory of the Shang Dynasty, and its system and culture were completely the same as those of the Shang Dynasty. Observing the fiefdom of Jizi in the early Zhou Dynasty and the mandate of King Cheng to Sushen, it is known that the reputation of the Shang Dynasty extended far to the northeast (Note 4). The three major peninsulas of East Asia, the Shandong Peninsula, the Liaodong Peninsula, and the Korean Peninsula, were already one family three thousand years ago. Both old historical materials on paper and new historical materials underground can prove this undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Chinese plants, like the Chinese nation, are exceptionally rich in content, resulting from the convergence of species from many plant regions. There are Siberian elements in northern China, Himalayan elements in western China, and Malay Peninsula elements in southern China. China was originally a vast continent, without an ocean to separate it, so the elements of each plant region could be mixed with each other. Northern species are often distributed in the southern provinces, and southern species can sometimes be distributed in higher latitudes (Note 5). Because of the large number of plant species and the excellent soil and climate, economic plants are exceptionally prosperous. Grains, fruits, industrial plants, and flowers mostly originated in China. Many of the ornamental plants in European gardens are derived from China. Our country's plants are not only of scientific interest but also of special economic value. Take soybeans as an example. Currently, the soybeans on the world market are almost entirely exported from the three northeastern provinces of China. Soybean cultivation in the inland provinces can be considered for self-sufficiency, while farmers outside the customs (关外) mainly aim for export. Soybeans are also known as yellow beans, and the Western name is Soybean. Soy is the "菽" (shū) in "菽豆" (shúdòu, soybeans). The Guangya says: "大豆，菽也" (Dàdòu, shū yě - Soybean is shū). The character "菽" (shū) was originally used as a variant of "大豆" (dàdòu, soybeans), but now it has become a common term in the world. Our country has cultivated soybeans very early. The Zuozhuan records the distinction between soybeans and wheat, and Liu An invented tofu, all of which are well-documented. Tofu has been called the national dish by some. In addition, soy milk, bean sprouts, soy oil, bean cakes, soy sauce, and other products have been invented over the generations and are all modified products of soybeans. If we want to point out a domestic product to represent China's natural wealth, it must first be prevalent throughout the country, so that it can be seen in the cold north of the Great Wall and the heat of the Lingnan area. Second, it must be circulated among the people, so that even the isolated and ignorant in the Three Family Village (三家村) can have the value of not forgetting it with every meal. Third, it must have world significance or international reputation. Then, the world-famous soybeans of the three northeastern provinces are the best symbol of the geographical unity of China.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a major discovery in the field of geomorphology, which is the Yanshanian orogeny discovered by Mr. Weng Wenhao. The mountain ranges on the earth's crust each have their own generation, era and history. From the results of geological research in Europe, the orogenic eras usually recognized are several, with the Caledonian in the middle of the Mesozoic Era, the Hercynian at the end of the Paleozoic Era, and the Alpine in the middle of the Tertiary Period being the most important. European scholars believe that the formation of world mountain ranges is mostly limited to these three. For example, the Himalayan period in Asia is comparable to the Alpine period. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the Chinese geological community has made efforts to study the Chinese mountain ranges in detail, and only then did it realize that Chinese geology has its own special scale and does not need to be the same as others. The second half of the Mesozoic Era was the era when most of the orogeny and igneous rock activity in China were the most intense. It is too late to call it Hercynian, and it is too early to call it Himalayan. Mr. Weng summarized the results of years of investigation, inferred in detail, and created a new name for this major orogenic period, calling it the Yanshanian orogeny. This orogenic period had not been noticed on the Eurasian continent, and the initial evidence was mostly obtained from the Yanshan Mountains in Hebei Province. However, continuing research revealed that it affected areas from Jilin and Heilongjiang in the north to Yunnan and Guizhou in the south. In 1928, Mr. Weng read this paper at the Pacific Science Conference held in Tokyo, Japan. The papers were published in Science Magazine and the Geological Journal (Note 6). This point has reached a definite realm after repeated research. Thus, the so-called Yanshanian period has not only become the most important orogenic period in East Asia, but the Chinese continent as a whole structure has also been recognized by scholars around the world. After the Yanshanian movement, a large subsidence zone appeared in northern China, called the Bohai Inner Geosyncline. This is the predecessor of the current Bohai Sea. In ancient times, the Bohai Sea was much larger than it is now. It was only through the actions of nature, as if "Yugong Moved the Mountains" and "Jingwei Filled the Sea," that great alluvial plains were created around the Bohai Sea. These plains should all be included in the scope of the large inner geosyncline geologically. The Bohai Inner Geosyncline includes three parts: the Liao River Plain, the Bohai Sea itself, and the North China Plain. The so-called inside and outside the customs (关内关外) are not only closely related economically, but also a unit in terms of geomorphology. Also, the two major peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong were originally connected, and the Dengzhou Strait was formed later. In the second half of the Cenozoic Era, faulting occurred on the Liaolu continent in the east, and the Dengzhou Strait appeared as a result. The intrusion of seawater formed the Bohai Sea. Although the two northeastern peninsulas are separated by the Dengzhou Strait, their geological structure and rock properties are very similar. In short, the Bohai Sea is entirely China's inland sea, and the land around the Bohai Sea is naturally China's territory. Any artificial boundaries violate natural form and obliterate national history. How can our people rest easy and how can we forget!

<p>The American China Famine Relief Fund is an organization jointly established by religious and charitable people from across the United States, dedicated to rescuing famine in China. Their efforts in publicity and fundraising have been very successful. Over the years, they have donated over ten million yuan in relief funds. Recently, in light of the severe disaster situation in Northern Jiangsu, they have donated 40,000 yuan in national currency to the Shanghai Office of the China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road in this city, to be used by the Yangtze River Basin Advisory Committee under its jurisdiction to support industrial relief. Specifically, 35,000 yuan is designated for the construction of the Weishan Lake dike, and 5,000 yuan for the repair of the Xuzhou highway. It is reported that the relief commission has publicly appointed Treasurer Baker and Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang Jichun to invite engineers from the Jiangsu Construction Department to inspect the sites. Construction is expected to begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e93">International Telecommunications Bureau Strives for International Calls; China-Japan Line Officially Implemented on February 15th; China-UK and China-India Lines Also Undergoing Testing <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was taken over by Acting Director Bao Keyong, it has continued to actively test the China-Japan call project that was actively pursued by the previous Director Wen Yuqing, with the aim of officially launching the service as scheduled on February 15th. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Tang Tiandong, the acting section chief of the Business Section of the Bureau, who stated:</p>
<p>China-Japan Line to Be Implemented as Scheduled</p>
<p>The China-Japan call project is currently still under testing. Tests are conducted every Monday and Thursday, and the results are satisfactory. The service can be launched as scheduled. As for the future call charges, the minimum call time is set at three minutes, costing 15 Japanese yen. Each additional minute will cost 5 Japanese yen. The reason for using Japanese yen as the standard is that international standards use gold francs, but converting to Chinese and Japanese currencies is troublesome. For convenience, Japanese yen is used as the unit.</p>
<p>China-UK Line Undergoing Testing</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau has previously tested call services with Italy, the Philippines, the United States, and Germany, with good results. However, due to insufficient radio station equipment, the services have not yet been officially launched. It is currently conducting call tests with the UK, also twice a week, but official launch is still pending.</p>
<p>China-India Line Revived</p>
<p>Due to the large amount of business between China and India, the Bureau previously proposed to India to establish direct calls between Shanghai and Mumbai to avoid the current hassle of relaying through Java. At the time, India did not agree. Recently, the other party suddenly brought up the matter again. It is currently planning to test the service, and it is hoped that it can be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Yang Zhuo'an, Returning from Studying in Europe and America, Left for Nanjing Yesterday; Reportedly Obtained a Great Deal of Material During This Trip <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ri Ri News Agency, Mr. Yang Zhuo'an, Economic Commissioner and Director of Statistics and Industry of Guangxi Province, was dispatched to Europe and America last year to study industry. He spent eight months traveling to the Philippines, Java, Malaya, Turkey, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan before returning to China. When Mr. Yang arrived in Shanghai last week, he accepted an invitation from the Fujian Provincial Government and took a China Airlines flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou to Fuzhou. After completing his business, he returned to Shanghai by plane yesterday. A reporter from the Ri Ri News Agency interviewed Mr. Yang during his travels. According to him, the results of this study are that he obtained a great deal of material. He has been studying the Soviet Union issue for many years, and he was not very clear about many aspects of theory and practice. Therefore, he stayed in the Soviet Union for three weeks, specializing in verification. In other European countries, he studied whether China's future economic construction should maintain the spirit of establishing the country on agriculture or whether it should be transformed into an agricultural and industrialized country, striving for self-sufficiency. In the United States, he spent three weeks studying the production and sales of tung oil. The reporter then asked about the recent situation of Fujian's administration. According to him, the government's organizational spirit and the security of various places have improved compared to the past. The construction undertaking is most successful with highways, and the newly established science museum and statistics office in recent years are sufficient to prove that Fujian's politics has moved forward to a new era. Mr. Yang took the night express train to Nanjing last night to report, and he is scheduled to return to Shanghai within a few days. It is reported that Mr. Yang has resigned from all his concurrent positions in the Guangxi Provincial Government in order to concentrate on compiling reports. (Ri Ri News Agency)</p>

<p>According to the Zhong Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent personnel abroad last year to investigate overseas Chinese affairs in Southeast Asia and Africa and to inspect local consulates. After returning to China, Commissioner Liang Yu and others learned that overseas Chinese in various places felt extremely disconnected from all the news about the political construction of their motherland in recent years. The love of the overseas Chinese for their motherland's National Day is unusually deep. They wanted to receive news from their motherland by radio, but China's Central Broadcasting Radio Station uses longwave broadcasting, making it difficult to reach places that are too far away. However, National Day propaganda is very important, not only in relation to the connection between the government and the overseas Chinese but also in terms of international impact. The Chinese government has no equivalent written propaganda in South Africa, and the Western newspapers there rarely publish news about China. As a result, patriotic overseas Chinese who care deeply about their motherland often feel depressed. Therefore, Liang drafted a memorandum, submitted it to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and forwarded it to the central government, requesting the establishment of a shortwave radio station to benefit overseas Chinese. It is reported that after receiving a letter from the Central Secretariat, the Central Broadcasting Radio Station Management Office has begun preparations and has submitted a draft plan. Once approved by the National Government, it will gradually establish shortwave radio stations in various places in Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce's Request Regarding the Purity of Silver Used by Silversmiths <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Silversmiths' Guild, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, concerning the use of silver in the manufacture of silver ornaments and utensils by silversmiths. The guild requested that the old standards of silver content be maintained. The Chamber of Commerce submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on November 25th of last year, and yesterday received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, document number 843 in the Finance Department, stating, "We have received your submission. The 'Regulations for the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products' promulgated by this Ministry were originally intended to preserve our country's silver reserves and maintain economic stability. Therefore, the regulations stipulate that chemical silver should be used as the raw material for silver products. If pure silver must be added, the amount of pure silver should not exceed 30% to show restriction. Moreover, the manufacture of silver utensils and ornaments is inherently extravagant. Currently, various European and American countries are switching to chemical silver as a substitute and plating it with gold and silver, which is inexpensive and of good quality. This practice can be imitated. We hereby extract the following compositions for your reference: 1. Nickel 10, Copper 45, Zinc 45; 2. Nickel 10, Copper 65, Zinc 25; 3. Nickel 12, Copper 62, Zinc 26; 4. Nickel 15, Copper 40, Zinc 45; 5. Nickel 15, Copper 50, Zinc 35; 6. Nickel 15, Copper 64, Zinc 21; 7. Nickel 18, Copper 58, Zinc 24; 8. Nickel 18, Copper 65, Zinc 17; 9. Nickel 20, Copper 55, Zinc 25; 10. Nickel 20, Copper 60, Zinc 20; 11. Nickel 20, Copper 75, Zinc 5; 12. Nickel 24, Copper 41, Zinc 35; 13. Nickel 25, Copper 50, Nickel 25; 14. Nickel 25, Copper 55, Nickel 20; 15. Nickel 30, Copper 47, Copper 23. Chemical silver, also known as nickel silver, is an alloy of nickel, copper, and zinc (sometimes with added tin, aluminum, lead, and iron). There are currently over 150 types sold in markets around the world. Our country's silver product industry is clinging to old ways and is already lagging behind. We should promote this type of alloy industry in order to save costs and benefit competition. The artistic effect is the same. If silver must be added, this Ministry has ordered the Central Mint to comply with Article 2 of the 'Regulations for the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products' and research alloy materials with a silver content of no more than 30%, combining silver, copper, nickel, zinc, and other substances. The Mint has prepared six types of such alloy materials, whose compositions are as follows: 1. Silver 30, Copper 50, Nickel 10, Zinc; 2. Silver 30, Copper 50, Nickel 6, Zinc 14; 3. Silver 25, Copper 50, Nickel 15, Zinc 10; 4. Silver 20, Copper 50, Nickel 20, Zinc 10; 5. Silver 30, Copper 60, Nickel 3, Zinc 7; 6. Silver 30, Copper 60, Nickel 5, Zinc 5. The above six types of alloy materials are white in color. Although the texture is slightly hard, it will not be difficult to process if heated and hammered, and they can be used to manufacture silver utensils and ornaments. In addition to this Ministry ordering the Central Mint to prepare and supply the above alloy materials, you must also comply with this Ministry's previous order that silver utensils and ornaments still be made using chemical silver as the raw material. If silver must be added, the above alloy materials should be used immediately, and the regulations should not be changed. As for your request to report the pure silver content of existing silver utensils and ornaments and the pure silver content of existing silver materials separately as two categories, silver utensils and ornaments and silver materials, this is feasible. In addition to distributing this notice, you must comply accordingly."</p>

<p>In recent years, Fujian Province has been plagued by both banditry and foreign aggression, and its future is far from optimistic. Fujianese people in Beijing and Shanghai deeply feel the imminent danger of their homeland. In order to quickly find ways to save the province and survive, their hometown will be devastated. Qin Wangshan and Huang Kesheng, political leaders from southern Fujian, have been traveling to Beijing and Shanghai to gather many comrades to form the Fujian Association. It will unite Fujianese people inside and outside the province, to shoulder this major responsibility, jointly safeguard national sovereignty, and seek economic suggestions, and promote local autonomy. On the 26th of this month, at 1:00 PM, the first meeting was held at the Delin Apartments to discuss specific measures. Attendees included Qin Wangshan, Li Ruixian, Huang Kesheng, Xie Jieying, Xiao Baishi, He Ziyang, Qiu Hanping, Li Wenbin, Hu Guigeng, Zhang Yuguang, Chen Kan, He Shiren, Zhang Gushan, Wang Xinming, Chen Jizhi, Wu Zezhong, Tang Jingsong, Su Jishi, Liu Chengqing, Xie Nanguang, and others.

<h3 id="e101">Strange Tale of Ice Blocking Navigation Off Dagu Port; Sea Ice Extends 150 Li, A Rare Occurrence Since the Early Republic; Chinese Merchant Ships Have All Suspended Service <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>This year, North China has experienced severe cold, with the Baihe River freezing over. Even off Dagu Port, the sea surface has frozen for more than 100 li, blocking waterways and obstructing traffic. This is a rare cold snap not encountered since the early years of the Republic. Shanghai-based shipping lines have been affected, resulting in numerous accidents. Now, Chinese merchant ships have completely suspended service. Detailed information is provided below:</p>
<p>Baihe River Ice Blockage</p>
<p>The Baihe River in Tianjin is the only waterway from Tanggu to Zizhulin, and it is also the passage for North China ships entering and leaving Tianjin. This year, the Baihe River has frozen more severely than in previous years, impeding navigation. Earlier this month, the Tianjin Customs announced that the inner harbor of the Baihe River was covered with ice more than one foot thick, obstructing waterway traffic and making navigation dangerous. The Tianjin Customs issued a notice to all shipping companies nationwide, declaring that the Baihe River was icebound and that even icebreakers could not effectively lead ships in. Therefore, ordinary North China liners could only sail to Tanggu Port. This was the situation before the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Sea Surface Freeze</p>
<p>The sea surface off Dagu Port is rarely affected by severe cold and freezing. After the 15th of this month, the climate in Tianjin underwent drastic changes, and the cold intensified. After the Baihe River froze, the sea surface off Dagu Port also began to freeze. After accumulating for many days, on the 16th and 17th, the ice layer extended from Dagu into the sea, reaching a length of 13 nautical miles. After the 18th, the ice field expanded daily and the ice layer thickened daily, stretching out in a continuous expanse, solidifying into an ice land. The frozen sea surface reached 45 nautical miles (over 140 li), with an ice thickness of over one foot. Not only could people walk on it, but also carriages and horses could gallop on it. Looking out, one could almost believe they were in the Arctic Circle. This unprecedented ice sea is the only one seen since the early years of the Republic.</p>
<p>Merchant Ships in Distress</p>
<p>This unprecedented freezing has created a great danger for the shipping industry in Tianjin. Before the 17th, merchant ships that braved the ice to enter Dagu Port were surrounded by heavy ice fields, unable to advance or retreat. The Xinshuntian, the first ship to be affected by the ice, had special icebreaking equipment and very thick steel, but it still broke its iron plates due to the impact of the ice. The Taishun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Kunshan Maru of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha endured countless hardships within the ice enclosure, sometimes ramming head-on, sometimes sweeping with the stern, advancing an inch and retreating a foot, and finally breaking through the encirclement after all kinds of dangers. As a result, the Taishun's hull was also damaged by the ice. At the same time, the number of other merchant ships that encountered danger is too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Aground</p>
<p>The Ekishin Maru, a cargo ship of the Dalian Kisen Kaisha's Shanghai-Tianjin liner service, has a cargo capacity of over 3,000 tons. This time, it was stranded by the solid ice, and its hull was grounded on the south shoal of Dagu Port. Because the ice is thick and difficult to move, it cannot be rescued. After the 18th, the Japanese ship was pushed onto the shoal by the ice floes. In less than three days, the ship was elevated so high that it resembled a multi-story building built on the beach. It is said that it will have to wait until the spring thaw before it can be rescued, at the earliest in two months.</p>
<p>Yushun Damaged</p>
<p>The Yushun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was heading to Tianjin this time, but it encountered ice before reaching Tanggu. It could not move forward or backward. The shipowner, Li Yunqu, struggled for several days, resulting in a shortage of coal and water. He telegraphed Shanghai for help, and finally managed to enter the port on the 23rd, but the front cargo hold had been damaged and was leaking water. After inspection by the Tianjin Customs, it was forbidden to sail. It must first be repaired and wait for an opportunity to follow another ship out of this ice enclosure before returning to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Suspend Service</p>
<p>The Chinese merchant ships on the North China route in this port, which originally numbered over 20 and transported miscellaneous grains and coal, have now completely suspended service to Tianjin due to the ice field on the waterway and the obstruction of the route. They have switched to Longkou, Yantai, and other places. The Xinfeng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's regular North China line has also been diverted to Yantai to transport salt, and the Xinming has been transferred to Fuzhou. Regular service will be resumed after the thaw. Only Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships are still operating because they have icebreaking equipment, but their schedules cannot be guaranteed.</p>

According to news from the Polish Embassy, the Puzewicz couple recently arrived in Hanoi, Annam. They have relied entirely on their motorized bicycle for transportation along the way, so they have experienced many hardships. The journey of over ten months has covered more than 16,000 miles. In the future, they plan to pass through the Guangxi-Guangdong border and detour to Shanghai by road. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai in two months. Shanghai is the last stop on their journey. After staying in Shanghai for a short time, they will return to their country.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Nippo, the malignant influenza that is rampant in Japan has been quite severe since it began spreading last winter. In Tokyo and Osaka, about 80 people are dying from the disease every day. Recently, it has spread to Shanghai, with about a dozen new cases reported daily. The symptoms of the disease, such as fever, can easily turn into bronchitis or pneumonia if not treated carefully, especially for children. There have also been cases of acute pneumonia. It is hoped that families will be especially vigilant and avoid going out at night unless necessary.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Great-Grandson of Li Hongzhang Enters Vagrant Work Training Center; Li Daoqiang, Only 15 Years Old, Already Spends Money Like Water; Family Hopes He Will Reform and Forces Him to Learn Diligence for Three Years <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, Li Daoqiang, the great-grandson of Li Hongzhang, the former Qing Dynasty grand secretary, is only 15 years old. Because he spends as much as 20,000 to 30,000 yuan every year, his family can no longer bear it and has sent him to the Caoxi Road Shanghai Vagrant Work Training Center to learn skills in order to reform his mind and body. A Datong News Agency reporter, upon receiving this news, drove to the center yesterday to inquire. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Young Age, But Addicted to Extravagance</p>
<p>Li's family fears that he will become addicted to extravagance and be unable to continue the family's legacy. Although Li Hongzhang's ancestral home was Hefei, Anhui, most of his descendants now reside in Shanghai. His great-grandson, Li Daoqiang, is only 15 years old. He studied at home with a tutor in his youth and recently transferred to the junior high school department of a certain middle school in Xujiahui. Although he is young, he is immersed in the extravagance of Shanghai, spending money like water and frequenting various gambling dens. It is estimated that he wastes as much as 20,000 to 30,000 yuan every year.</p>
<p>Sent to Work Training Center Hoping for Reform</p>
<p>In order to reform his mind and body, he was recently sent to the Caoxi Road Shanghai Vagrant Work Training Center, hoping he would repent. A Datong News Agency reporter drove to the center yesterday to inquire and met with the center's director, Mr. Wu, who did not deny the matter of Li Daoqiang being sent to the center for work training. According to him, according to the center's regulations, all those who enter the center for work training, regardless of whether their family is rich or poor, must work and learn diligence. However, since Li entered the center, he has still refused to work, so he must undergo a considerable period of guidance before being given work. Also, according to the center's regulations, those who enter the center must work diligently for three years before being allowed to leave. Therefore, the center will also handle Li according to the regulations and will not make an exception.</p>
<p>Family Asks to Refuse Visitors</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reporter then asked Mr. Wu to introduce him to Li, but Mr. Wu politely refused, saying that he had been instructed by his family not to allow anyone to meet him, regardless of who they were. Subsequently, under Mr. Wu's guidance, the reporter was taken to visit various parts of the center. The internal facilities were completely modeled after a prison. There are currently over 800 vagrants, some working diligently and others attending classes. The discipline is extremely strict.

<p>Brief History and Current Situation of the Work Training Center</p>
<p>The Caoxi Road Shanghai Vagrant Work Training Center was jointly established in 1926 by Li Pingshu (deceased), the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and various public organizations. It began accepting vagrants in August 1929. The source of funding is an annual subsidy of 12,000 yuan from the Shanghai Chenghuang Miao Board of Directors, and the remainder is allocated by the Shanghai Charity Association. The entire center occupies 94 mu of land and is divided into adult and children's sections, each with dormitories, workshops, lecture halls, classrooms, dining halls, and hospitals. The sources of vagrants are: ① sent by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau; ② recommended by organizations or individuals who donate more than 500 yuan annually; ③ recommended by the center's directors; ④ requested by the vagrant's family, but the cost of food and clothing must be borne by themselves, with a monthly fee of six yuan, which must be prepaid for three years upon entry. The vagrants in the center are paid for their work, with a minimum monthly income of two to three yuan and a maximum monthly income of six to seven yuan.</p>

<p>Rong Shangqian, a seventy-year-old man from Guangdong who has retired to a villa in Jing'an, is in a bitter feud with his eldest son, Rong Peng. Rong Peng previously filed a lawsuit against Rong Shangqian in the name of his children's legal representative, seeking division of property. The third instance concluded, and Rong Peng appealed. Shangqian then hired a lawyer to invoke Article 1145 of the Civil Code and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, requesting the revocation of Rong Peng's inheritance rights. A trial has already been opened, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shiye continued the hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court. The plaintiff's second son, Rong Hong, also attended the hearing. Although the plaintiff is over seventy years old, his</p>
<p>Vigor Unabated</p>
<p>During his statement, he seemed to be furious. According to him, the defendant and his children were all educated by him. The defendant spent a lot of money studying in the United States. After returning, he still provided thousands of yuan annually. However, after his mother died, he plotted to kidnap him. Last year, he sued him. How can a son kidnap his father, or a son sue his father? He really couldn't bear it and filed a lawsuit to revoke his inheritance rights. Judge Peng then advised that these were all past events and did not need to be traced back, and that a father and son going to court was contrary to etiquette. If he wished to withdraw the lawsuit, the defendant should be ordered to provide a</p>
<p>Letter of Repentance</p>
<p>And be a dutiful son in the future, without any unfilial behavior. Upon hearing this, Rong Peng immediately expressed his willingness to comply with the court's good intentions and pleaded guilty to his father in court with a rod. However, Rong Shangqian still showed anger, patted his chest, and shook his head, saying that his son's previous accusations were all nonsense. After his mother died, she only left 10,000 yuan of property. The defendant initially claimed that there were 400,000 yuan of inheritance, and now he claims there are 2 million yuan. The judge asked him how much property he had now. The plaintiff replied that he had served in the government for forty years, so he had some property, several tens of thousands of yuan. In recent years, he has been doing business, and the profits are uncertain. He also owes people money. The judge then instructed him that since you</p>
<p>Do Not Want to Reconcile</p>
<p>And must deprive the defendant of his inheritance rights, then you should provide evidence and state the reasons. If you rely on your empty words, the defendant will also not be convinced. Thereupon, the plaintiff detailed his history of serving in the government during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic to prove that the defendant's claim that he had not served in the government for long was untrue. The court then inquired about the current situation of the second son, Rong Hong, and the usual relationship between them. The plaintiff said that Hong was dutiful. The court continued to ask, "You have two sons. In the future, your estate should be inherited equally by both sons. Now you are requesting the revocation of your eldest son's inheritance rights. To whom will this share belong?" The plaintiff suddenly said, "It will be kept for</p>
<p>Food and Clothing</p>
<p>Expenses." The judge said, "Eating and clothing do not require that much. What do you mean?" The plaintiff shook his head and said nothing. The judge said, "If you want to file a lawsuit, according to the law, to lose inheritance rights, there must be two elements: insult and abuse. You don't need to be angry. You can speak calmly and in detail, and provide evidence for verification." The plaintiff was silent. The judge then ordered the lawyers of both parties to debate. The plaintiff's lawyer spoke first, saying that three or four years ago, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the defendant presented pastries to his father. The plaintiff tasted a little, and the rest was given to the family. The abdomens of those who ate it later all swelled. This can certainly be called abuse, but now there is no evidence to prove it. However, the</p>
<p>Insult Aspect</p>
<p>Is a certain fact. Before the defendant and the plaintiff were involved in the lawsuit, the mediation statement submitted by the defendant was like a false accusation. It was an act of disrespecting elders. The statements in the document were mostly fabricated. Therefore, the plaintiff is requesting the revocation of the defendant's inheritance rights in accordance with the law. The defendant's lawyer then argued that the mediation statement in the previous case was written by lawyer Liu Shifang on behalf of the defendant. Because the letter the defendant sent to lawyer Liu at the time contained slanderous remarks, lawyer Liu was inevitably emotionally agitated, so he inadvertently revealed this in the mediation statement. This was not the defendant's own fault. Since the country allows people to file lawsuits, filing a lawsuit cannot be considered an insult. The judge then concluded and scheduled the judgment to be pronounced on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Begging for Money from a Thief, Shocked to See a Pistol; Reported to the Police and Tracked Him Down; High School Janitor Rewarded for Reporting; Rickshaw Puller Injured by Stray Bullet and Sent to Hospital <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Gao Xiaoguanzi, a man from Jiangbei, is 28 years old. He used to be a detective, but recently he has fallen into poverty and become a beggar. At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Gao was alone, waiting for pedestrians to pass by at the intersection of Longmen Road and Racecourse Road in the Public Concession, begging for copper coins. At that time, a pedestrian was walking west along Racecourse Road, turning into Longmen Road and walking south. Gao went forward to beg from him, but the man, seeing that a beggar was begging from him, became angry, pulled out a pistol, and threatened Gao, forbidding him to make a sound. Gao was shocked and stepped back a few steps, watching the man with the gun turn into SiDuYa Road and walk east. Gao knew that he must be a bandit robbing people, but he was frightened and unwilling to submit. So he followed him stealthily, intending to report to the police. However, there were no police officers in that area. He followed him to the front of the Great World Entertainment Center on the corner of MinTiNi Road, and saw the man turn south along MinTiNi Road. Gao saw Chinese Constable No. 408 of the French Police Station standing guard in front of the Great World. He went forward and reported to the constable, who tracked down and arrested the suspect. When they reached the entrance of the LaiCai Market Street (NingXing Street), the thief with the gun discovered that he was being chased by the police. He pulled out his pistol, fired backward to resist arrest, and turned into LaiCai Market Street, fleeing east. Along the way, he fired to resist, and a stray bullet grazed the left calf of Zheng XueLi, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei who was resting by the roadside. Constable No. 408 immediately fired three shots in return and blew his whistle to summon police officers from nearby posts. The thief then turned into the west side of Xin Qiao Street and headed south. The beggar Gao XiaoGuanZi also helped to chase him. The patrol constables of the Fa Da Ma Road station, Chinese Constable No. 135 and Vietnamese Constable No. 341, heard the whistle and gunfire and rushed to the west side of Xin Qiao Street on Fa Da Ma Road to intercept the thief. Chinese Constable No. 135 also fired one shot to stop the thief from advancing. He captured the thief, seized a Brownling pistol, and found four live bullets in the gun. He then took the thief, the beggar Gao XiaoGuanZi who reported the incident, and the injured rickshaw puller Zheng XueLi to the police station. Under interrogation, the thief gave his name as Peng GaoSheng, 27 years old, from Pudong. He said that he had been a boatman but was now unemployed and had resorted to theft. The detectives searched him and found over ten yuan in banknotes and some silver coins. He was immediately sent to the Lu Jia Wan General Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, he ordered that the informant, Gao XiaoGuanZi, be rewarded with three yuan in legal tender and sent away. The rickshaw puller was rewarded with one yuan and sent to the hospital for treatment. The thief, Peng, was detained for investigation and sent to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Bai Yushuang, a female performer of "bengbeng" opera at the Empire Theatre on Avenue Joffre and Rue McGao Bao Lu, originally named Li Guiqin, is twenty-four years old this year and resides at No. 7, Samsung Lane, at the end of Rue Pellerin in the French Concession. Bai Ling originally performed in Tianjin and Beijing. Since coming to Shanghai, she has been highly praised by Shanghai opera enthusiasts for her exceptional talent. On the evening of the day before yesterday (the 27th) around 8 pm, Bai was dressing in her residence, intending to go to the Empire Theatre to perform the full-length night opera "Licentious Mirror." Unexpectedly, as soon as she stepped out of the gate of Samsung Lane and hailed a rickshaw, a strange young man suddenly jumped out, holding an oil paper package. He crept behind Bai Ling, untied the pre-prepared excrement in the package, and violently covered Bai Ling's head with it, causing the golden excrement to drench Bai's head and face, as well as the newly made gray-back overcoat worth 400 gold, completely staining it with filth. Bai, suffering from this prank, cried out for help. The man and woman fled southward. Bai's mother and neighbors heard the noise and chased after them, reaching Xujiahui Road, where they alerted the police. With the assistance of Officer Yue from No. 476, the man was apprehended and taken to the Louzawei Central Police Station. The man confessed his name as Zhao Yuqing, 25 years old, from Hebei, residing at No. 15, Xingren Lane, Dapu Road, in the Chinese area. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives Liu Jinrong and Lu Zhenduo to investigate. After confirming the facts, he ordered Zhao to be detained for further investigation. Bai Ling also returned to her residence to change clothes and wash up, and then went to the theatre to perform. Yesterday, the police station escorted Zhao to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Peng interrogated him. Attorney Yuan Jiahuang from the Police Department explained the case, requesting an extension to apprehend the instigator, thoroughly investigate the case, and then file a lawsuit. The plaintiff, Bai Yushuang, also known as Li Guiqin, represented by her mother, brought the soiled leather overcoat to the court to testify and hired lawyer Wu Zhengxun to represent her, filing an incidental private lawsuit to recover 400 yuan for the value of the soiled coat and losses. The court verified the report, briefly questioned the defendant Zhao Yuqing about his name, and then adjourned the hearing to February 5th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Norwegian merchant ship "Yafu," which was sunk by the Chinese merchant ship "Tongde" in the waters off Lujiazui, Pudong, at 9:00 am on December 17th of the year before last, has been salvaged by the Russian Far East Salvage Company after repeatedly dispatching experts to oversee the work and spending over 100,000 yuan. Because the ship's hull was heavy, it suffered several setbacks. The Jianghai Customs Authority, considering the sunken ship an obstacle to navigation, had considered bombing it. However, the company did not show weakness and, in September of last year, added water pumps and floating cranes to continue the work. First, the masts and funnels were dismantled to facilitate the operation. After three months of work, the water in all the cabins was completely pumped out. Suddenly, at high tide on the day before yesterday evening, it automatically floated to the surface. The entire body was covered in mud, and the iron plates were completely rusted. It will then be towed into the dock for major repairs. As for the municipal ferries operating to the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong and the Beijing Road Wharf in Puxi, which had previously changed to the South Customs Wharf in Pudong due to the salvage of the sunken ship, they will now return to the Chunjiang Wharf due to the floating of the sunken ship.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Deputy Manager of China United Trust Company: Yan Futang Sues for Divorce: Accuses His Wife of Passive Abuse and Frequently Returning to Ningbo Under Pretexts <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yan Futang, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 168, Yili, Rue Petain in the French Concession, is 55 years old this year and currently serves as the deputy manager of China United Trust Company (formerly known as Central, now renamed by the Ministry of Finance) on Beijing Road. After his first wife passed away, lacking a hostess for the household, he married Wang Xianxia (31 years old this year), a fellow villager, as his second wife through a matchmaker in April of the 23rd year. Their relationship was quite affectionate after the marriage. Recently, Wang often returned to Ningbo, her mother's home in Shaoxing, under various pretexts and did not return for a long time. Even after returning home, she was indifferent and refused to do housework, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Yan, considering Wang's passive abuse unbearable for a lifelong marriage, filed a petition with the Second Special District Court for mediation in November of last year. Failing to obtain a divorce, he hired lawyer Shi Zhuoren to file a formal lawsuit. Based on the complaint, the court, through Judge Li Liang, summoned them for trial in the Seventh Civil Court yesterday. The plaintiff claimed illness and was represented by his lawyer, who stated the facts of the lawsuit. He also stated that the defendant frequently returned to Ningbo without reason. The last time she left home, she sent a letter through lawyer Yan Zhi, requesting a divorce. Now, the plaintiff, unable to bear the defendant's passive treatment, requests a judgment granting the divorce. The defendant, Wang Xianxia, arrived in court with her representing lawyer, Wang Shizong, claiming that she did not want a divorce under any circumstances. After marrying on the 19th day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the 23rd year, she stayed at her mother's home for two months each during the first two visits and three months during the third visit. She did housework at home and never neglected her husband. He was the one who ignored me. I poured tea and offered it, but he refused to drink it, etc. Then, her representing lawyer Wang Shizong stated that the defendant is a woman from an old-fashioned family. There are no specific rules in law regarding a woman's return to her parents' home, so how can it be restricted? Moreover, the defendant performed household duties at home, and the plaintiff has not provided evidence for his claims. As for the defendant's request for divorce, it was because the plaintiff used to smoke opium and needed the defendant to serve him day and night. Because the defendant could not bear the mental suffering, she requested a divorce. Now that the plaintiff has quit opium, the defendant is very willing to reconcile and live together. The plaintiff's request for divorce is without reason and should be rejected. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested a postponement to bring the plaintiff and witnesses to court next time to prove the defendant's usual behavior. At this point, the court believed that the facts were clear and did not need to be postponed. It ordered the lawyers of both parties to argue and then adjourned the case, scheduling the judgment for 2:00 pm on the 31st.</p>

<p>The Louzawei Police recently received a tip that someone was using a car to transport drugs every night between Guangxi Road and Jiujiang Road. The police chief ordered detectives Xu Dezhong (Western Police No. 139, Chinese Police No. 2950) to station themselves there and inspect passing cars. At 10:45 pm the night before last, a car suddenly sped by at full speed. The detectives, suspecting its behavior, stepped forward to stop and search it. They found a package of heroin inside the car and took the driver, Li Kuiyuan, a native of Qingjiang, to the police station. According to Li's statement, the source of the heroin was his landlord, Wang Yongqing, who lives at No. 9, Wu Jia Lane, Huanlong Road. Wang Yongqing had ten taels of heroin hidden there and asked him to find a way to sell it. Because he knew a car driver, Zhou A'gen, Wang gave me this package of heroin as a sample, but he couldn't find Zhou, so he was arrested. The detectives immediately joined forces with detectives from the French Concession Police Station to arrest Wang Yongqing, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation, filing a lawsuit in accordance with Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and stated that No. 9, Wu Jia Lane, where the defendant lived, had been rented by the Japanese last year to manufacture drugs and was busted by the French Concession Police Station. Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court questioned Li Kuiyuan, and Li's statement was the same as the one he gave to the police station. After verifying the confession, Judge Qian ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for a further hearing.</p>

<p>According to the Riri News Agency, after the Shanghai County Government was ordered to earnestly handle the registration of opium smokers for self-renewal, County Magistrate Ye Zhendong gathered the village chiefs and bao chiefs in the Third District at 2:00 pm the day before yesterday to instruct them on the registration of opium smokers for self-renewal. He will conduct a door-to-door inspection in conjunction with armed units and guide the bao chiefs on various methods for the general re-census of the entire county's population. At 3:00 pm, he went to the First District Office to gather the chief of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Tingshan, and the bao chiefs of Minhang, secretly ordering the chiefs of various sections to make a list of unlicensed opium smokers and immediately dispatch armed police to the various bao to arrest unlicensed opium smokers and order them to register. Yesterday, he led the Chief of the County Public Security Bureau, Xu Yuyin, to the Fourth District of Pudong to investigate opium smokers.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Gu Zhuxuan's Appeal Case: Investigation Hearing Held Yesterday: Lawyer Zhu Dianqing Summoned to Testify, Gu Zhuxuan Not Questioned Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage and a native of Yancheng, was reported by Zhao Guangfu, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, for inciting the crime. He was arrested at his residence in Yonghe Lane, North Xizang Road, on September 10th of last year by Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police Station. He was escorted to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. After the trial, he was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Gu, dissatisfied with the original judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. This case was once heard by a collegiate panel of the High Court, but because evidence needed to be investigated, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. It is now learned that the Third Branch of the High Court originally scheduled a continuation of the hearing after midnight yesterday. Because the summoned witnesses did not arrive completely, Judge Wang Cheng temporarily went to the Third Criminal Court at 2:30 pm to hold an investigation hearing. Only lawyer Zhu Dianqing reported to the court. The official told Zhu that he was being summoned today in Gu Zhuxuan's murder case to testify and should tell the truth. After administering an oath, the official asked Zhao Guangfu in the Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao cases why he hadn't reported the crime earlier and only did so now. According to Zhao's confession, when he was detained in the detention center, Xue Zhenyi told him not to accuse Gu and asked lawyer Zhu Dianqing to appeal for you. Is there any truth to this? Zhu replied that there was no such thing. The court also showed Gu and Wang the case file, in which Zhao Guangfu's interrogation statement at the police station was given to Zhu for review. After reviewing it, Zhu claimed that there was no such thing at all. He asked, "Do you know Xue Zhenyi?" Zhu replied, "Xue was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in the 23rd year for a murder case and appealed to your court, and I was his defense attorney." He asked, "Do you know Gu Zhuxuan?" Zhu replied, "Gu is a fellow villager from Jianghuai. I know him, but we don't have any contact." He asked, "Has Gu ever asked you to do anything?" The answer was no. At this point, Zhu was ordered to sign and leave. Then, Zhao Guangfu was brought in for questioning, and the official questioned Zhao in detail about the indictment, letter, and note. Zhao's testimony was the same as in the previous few court hearings, with some evasions and ambiguous language. Finally, the official ordered Zhao to write numbers in pencil to compare handwriting and announced the suspension of the investigation, pending a decision on when to question him again. Because an investigation hearing was held in this case, the appellant, Gu Zhuxuan, was not brought to court. Also, witness Chen A'lin, the owner of the Jin Yongxing hardware store, was represented by legal advisor Jin Liang, who brought a subpoena to the court and stated that Chen A'lin had returned to Suzhou for the Lunar New Year holiday and would be able to appear in court next time. He requested a postponement to send a letter to notify him. Judge Wang approved the postponement to Friday (tomorrow) afternoon, ordering Chen to appear in court for questioning. Another witness, Shen Ciliang, could not be served with a subpoena, so he did not appear in court.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Residents of Shengsi Island Oppose Division of Governance: Joint Petition to the Executive Yuan to Stop the Division Movement and Appeal to All Jiangsu Elders for Assistance <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association petitioned the Executive Yuan to include the Shengsi Islands in Zhejiang Province's governance, various Jiangsu Province aquatic product agencies and fishery groups have repeatedly telegraphed their opposition. The Chongming County legal groups opposed it even more strongly and sent representatives to Beijing to petition. Yesterday, Xu Jinshan and Yang Youcai, the chiefs of various townships, towns, baojia, and more than 200 people on Shengsi Island, jointly petitioned the President of the Executive Yuan to stop the Zhejiang Province's division of governance movement to quell disputes. They also published a notice in the newspaper appealing to all Jiangsu elders and brothers for assistance. The original petition and notice are recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Executive Yuan Petition</p>
<p>The Shengsi Islands belong to Jiangsu territory and have always been governed by Jiangsu. For hundreds of years, there has been peace and tranquility. However, recently, because Jiangsu Province is working hard to rectify things, a few Zhejiang natives, who do not want to act in private, have had fantastic ideas and incited local gentry to blindly petition for division. The news has spread, and they are deeply indignant. The Shengsi Islands are located north of Jinshanwei and are independent islands that do not overlap with the Zhoushan Islands of Zhejiang Province. During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, they were once sold to the British by unscrupulous elements and subsequently occupied. After Jiangsu gentry Zhang Shen memorialized and requested the Qing court to negotiate the recovery, from the point of view of geography and history, it should undoubtedly be governed by Jiangsu. The various statements made by the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association are actually being incited by others to blindly petition with embellished words. The small number of unscrupulous people who insist on dividing the governance to Zhejiang are for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.  "Restore Cuttlefish Cage Fishing": Fishermen in Shengquan Island use nets to catch cuttlefish. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, fishermen from Wen and Tai in Zhejiang Province manufactured and drove cages to invade the fishing grounds. At that time, cage fishing was harmful to the breeding of cuttlefish and hindered the livelihoods of the islanders. Fishermen and fishery groups from our various islands filed petitions to the Jiangsu Province to ban it. Fishermen in Zhejiang Province, unable to implement cage fishing in our Shengsi Islands, repeatedly thought about dividing the governance to Zhejiang Province, thinking it was a radical solution. Thus, there was the riot and fighting in the 21st year, the boundary delimitation meeting of the Ministry of Industry, and this renewed request. Their purpose of restoring cuttlefish cage fishing is clear.</p>
<p>2.  "Open Gambling to Deceive Fishermen": The Shengsi Islands are an important fishing area in Jiangsu Province. Every fishing season, fishermen gather here. Most of the people from Zhejiang Province on the various islands are kind, but there are also many stubborn ones. Every time the fishing season begins, when the fishermen's pockets are full, they open gambling dens to deceive the fishermen, causing the fishermen's hard-earned money to be swept away, and some have no way to make a living and become thieves. How painful is this! Fortunately, Chongming County has set up districts to strictly prohibit this trend. Otherwise, the fishermen's livelihoods and local security will be unimaginable. However, these unscrupulous people rely on this for a living. Now that it is banned, it is tantamount to killing them, so they urgently seek to divide the governance to Zhejiang Province to act in private. In summary, the reasons why the Shengsi Islands cannot be divided into Zhejiang are so strong, and the motives for requesting division into Zhejiang are like this. If it unfortunately becomes a reality, the future is dangerous and unbearable to imagine. Jinshan and others either grew up here or have lived here for many years. The benefits and harms are the same, and the pain is deeply felt. We dare to jointly request your approval to quickly stop this division of governance movement to conform to popular sentiment and quell disputes. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Original draft of the announcement:</p>
<p>To all Jiangsu elders and brothers: The Shengsi Islands have always been governed by Jiangsu. Administrative facilities are progressing, and it is appropriate to ban cuttlefish cage fishing and strictly prohibit unscrupulous people from gambling to protect the livelihoods of fishermen, which is particularly appreciated by our islanders. However, there are unscrupulous people who are inconvenient to act in private, blindly petitioning the authorities to divide the governance to Zhejiang. Losing their minds and acting like lunatics, it is particularly hateful. Our residents of Shengsi vow to oppose it. In addition to petitioning the Executive Yuan to quickly stop this division of governance movement to quell disputes, we ask all Jiangsu elders and brothers to uphold justice and provide assistance. It is hoped.</p>

<p>In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, on April 1st, Sun Chen Desheng (i.e. Madam Sun Chen), a woman from Haimen, filed a complaint with the Jiangsu High Court accusing Ni Yueqiu, the head of the Fifth District of Haimen County, of killing her husband Sun Yuanfu, assisting County Magistrate Xia Wujiao in demanding bribes, etc. The High Court ordered the Shanghai District Court to accept the case. After the trial, Ni Yueqiu was sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment. Ni refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. He was sent to Jiangsu, and the court opened several times</p>
<p>The trial has not concluded</p>
<p>Recently, Yuan Zaixing, Yuan Sanlang, Yuan Shenshi, Yu Jianglang, Ge Zhaoqing, and others jointly accused Ni Yueqiu of murder, etc., and filed a complaint with the Ministry of Justice Administration, which ordered the Shanghai District Court to investigate the case together. The prosecutor Ouyang Shu took Ni Yueqiu's case and, after several clear investigations, initiated a public prosecution, stating that the defendant Ni Yueqiu served as the head of the Fifth District and the head of the defense regiment in Haimen in the 19th year of the Republic of China. Because</p>
<p>Communist bandits were causing trouble</p>
<p>spreading more and more, on July 20th of that year, Ni personally led the regiment members, etc., to arrest Yuan Erlang, Yuan Guilang, Yu Jincai, Ge Linggou, etc., who were suspected of being robbers, and tied them to the wilderness on the east side of Qilin Town in the district and shot them all. At that time, he intended to quell the chaos from power and did not report to the county government. However, when questioned, Ni Yueqiu insisted that he only killed four people and couldn't remember which four people they were. The provincial police team said they were robbers and directly sent the Public Security Bureau to arrest them and kill them in the east market of Qilin Town. However, according to Yuan Sanlang's statement, his brother Yuan Guilang</p>
<p>Elder brother Yuan Erlang</p>
<p>In June of the 19th year, he was shot and killed by Ni Yueqiu at the same time as Yu Jincai and Ge Linggou. They were all related to the gun case at the Hou Diren (i.e. Shi Diancheng) home, and Yuan Shenshi (i.e. Yuan Erlang's wife), Ge Zhaoqing (i.e. Ge Linggou's mother), and Yu Jianglang (i.e. Yu Jincai's father) said it again. According to witness Li Degang's statement, the bandits were very powerful at that time. It is said that there were still four Communist bandits (referring to Yuan Erlang, Yuan Guilang, Yu Jincai, and Ge Linggou), who were said to be bandits and were killed by Ni Yueqiu and his men. Zhang Haoran said, "The district office</p>
<p>Killed four people"</p>
<p>He Jian said that Ni Yueqiu killed many bandits and did not report the case at that time. Based on the above facts, it is sufficient to determine that Ni Yueqiu committed murder and is suspected of committing a crime under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. In conclusion, the defendant Ni Yueqiu is suspected of committing a serious crime. In addition to the cases of Sun Yuanfu's murder, etc., which have already been prosecuted, the cases of murder, arson, looting, and rape sued by Shen Jiping and others should be waited for the case file of Sun Yuanfu's murder (on appeal) to be returned for reference.</p>
<p>Re-disposal</p>
<p>In addition, the prosecution is initiated in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law and sent for trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Peiming presided over the trial in the Twelfth Court. He sent police to Jiangsu in advance to bring Ni Yueqiu back. Ni Yueqiu hired lawyer Chen Xiangru to appear in court to defend him. According to Ni Yueqiu's statement, he is 30 years old, a native of Haimen, and has been working in the education field. He graduated from Nantong Normal School and is currently the</p>
<p>Normal school principal</p>
<p>and the head of the Fifth District, and the head of the defense regiment. He was asked, "Do you know Yuan Guilang, Yuan Erlang, Yu Jincai, Ge Linggou, etc.?" He replied, "I don't know them." He was asked, "Their families accused you of killing them without mining?" He replied, "There is no such thing." He was asked, "At that time, you said that the four of them were suspected of being robbers, so you shot them?" He replied, "I heard that the provincial police team killed them." He was asked, "According to the prosecutor's investigation, Li Degang said that you killed them." He replied, "Our district office is located in Qilin Town and is connected to the provincial police team, so there may be a misunderstanding." After the questioning, the official said, "Today, the plaintiffs and witnesses have not reported, so we will schedule another hearing." Ni Yueqiu was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Yuanyuan Farm Still Directly Distributes Milk: The fresh milk produced by Yuanyuan Farm on Daxilu is of pure quality, rich in ingredients, and has long been praised by all walks of life. The number of drinkers has almost surpassed the entire Shanghai. However, due to some original reason, distribution was once suspended. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous people used the farm's milk, mixed with other milk qualities, and took the opportunity to sell it at a high profit, causing the majority of drinkers to question it by letter and telegram. In order to maintain its original reputation and repay all drinkers, the farm resumed self-disinfection and direct distribution by personnel from the 26th of this month, in order to avoid malpractices and prevent counterfeiting.

<p>— Edited by China Credit Information Service (Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, No. 11) (1) The Past and Present of the New Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>New medicines, commonly known as Western medicines, were introduced to China from Europe and the United States along with Western medicine. Although there is no clear timeline for its rise and fall, it can be roughly divided into three periods. The initial period from the initial import to 1904; the competitive period from 1905 to 1929; and the transition period from 1930 to the present. The situation of each period will be described below.</p>
<p>Initial Period - After foreigners opened Shanghai as a commercial port in 1842 according to the Treaty of Nanjing, new medicines began to be imported at this time. Initially, only foreigners and foreign bridge residents used them, and the people who operated this business were all foreigners, such as the British Hospital (although named as a hospital, it was actually a pharmacy), Lao Deji Pharmacy, Watson's Yong, etc. The lower-level employees were all Chinese. Later, the Chinese gradually gained trust in new medicines because of their rapid and simple effects. Gu Songquan, a Chinese employee of the British Hospital, first raised funds to establish a Chinese and Western pharmacy on Fuzhou Road (the current site of Kaiming Bookstore) in 1904. This was the beginning of Chinese people operating the new pharmaceutical industry. At that time, because there were not many pharmacies, and only this pharmacy was operated by Chinese businessmen, the profit was very high. Therefore, Chinese employees of other foreign pharmacies also raised funds to establish pharmacies, such as Huaying, Central, Huamei, Zhongde, Zhongfa, Huayang, and Nanyang (not the current Huayang on Second Horse Road and Nanyang on Nanjing Road). During this period, although the number of new creations increased year by year, the original pharmacies were not affected, and they all had huge profits every year. The reasons were roughly the following four points: the number of purchasers increased year by year, and the increase exceeded the turnover of the new pharmacies created each year; the types of business were wider than they are now, such as dental equipment, cosmetics, and photographic materials, which all belonged to the scope of pharmacy business; there were very few pharmacies in the mainland, and users purchased directly from Shanghai; and foreigners allowed more favorable conditions for Chinese businessmen in order to broadly sell their products, and the profit added to the price of goods by each pharmacy was also higher than it is now.</p>
<p>Competitive Period - After 1905, pharmacies such as Jicheng and Dalu Wuzhou were established one after another, and small-scale pharmacies such as Huade and Liji grew like mushrooms after rain. Due to too many businesses, the turnover gradually decreased until the outbreak of the European War, when it began to recover. Because during the war, medicines from countries such as the United States and Japan continued to be imported, while the source of products from European and Western countries was cut off, and prices rose sharply. For example, carbolic acid, which originally sold for 75 cents per pound, rose to 14 yuan; phenacetin, which originally sold for 3 yuan per pound, rose to 60 yuan; and 20 oil, which rose from 50 cents to 1.5 yuan per pound. Lion Brand 606, due to lack of goods, the highest selling price was as high as 120 yuan per branch (originally sold for 4 yuan per branch). Those who had inventory all made multiple profits, but after the war, the color faded again, and each family adopted a small profit policy in order to sell more, and some even divided their attention to their own brand products. At that time, the more famous products of this brand were artificial blood (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy), 606 ointment medicine (produced by Taihe Pharmacy), Rendan (produced by Zhongfa Pharmacy), Chicken Brand Bone Pain Dew (produced by Jihuatang Pharmacy), Jiukewan (produced by Tang Shiyi Pharmaceutical Factory), Bailingji (produced by Jiufu Company), and other six kinds.</p>
<p>Transition Period - After 1930, the sales volume did not increase significantly, and the scope of business shrank day by day. Photographic materials have been completely taken away by those who specialize in this business, and most of the cosmetics have been occupied by Guang Sheng Hang, Family Industrial Society, and other cosmetics merchants, while dental equipment is sold exclusively by the Dental Business Association, and very few people purchase from pharmacies. The competition among the industry is even more intense, and they compete to sell famous medicines at reduced prices as a means of attracting customers. For example, red tonic pills, Pareto, aspirin, creosote, Scott's cod liver oil, Qingdaowan, Douan's ointment, etc., are all sold at cost or even below cost. Later, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association dissuaded them and canceled the reduced price sales advertisements, but secret competition is still inevitable, making it difficult to obtain profits. Therefore, the new pharmaceutical industry, although people outside the industry do not know the details, people in the industry have long regarded it as a chicken rib. Until Jicheng Pharmacy stranded in front (closed on October 28, 1934 and reopened on January 28, 1935) and Huaying Pharmacy closed behind, the image of decline began to be seen. Both pharmacies were known for their strong strength in the industry. In recent years, the industry seems to have a tendency to believe in manufacturing. For example, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, which used to manufacture and sell Peacock toothpaste and other cosmetics, has been specializing in the manufacture of various injections since the "September 18th Incident." Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory was originally founded by the German merchant Xinyi Pharmacy. Since 1930, it has been taken over by Chinese merchants, and its Vitamin C Baoming is quite popular. Wuzhou Pharmacy can use a large part of its funds for drug manufacturing. Zhongxi Pharmacy also has plans to organize the Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory. Other pharmaceutical factories such as Haibo and Kangle are all committed to imitation, and it seems that they have realized that relying solely on sales is not a long-term solution.

<h3 id="e139">Experts Talk About Attending the World Games <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of various sports candidates for the World Games, the board of directors of the China National Sports Advancement Association has made a resolution. The reporter interviewed various experts to solicit opinions. They are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>Ma John Talks About Selection Criteria</p>
<p>Ma John said that the World Games preliminary selection is presided over by the National Sports Advancement Association. Whether centralized training will be conducted after the representatives are selected depends on the economic situation. Attending the World Games this time is hopeless to win the championship, but it is for sightseeing and polishing, so that Chinese athletes can benefit from the experience of others. Therefore, in addition to achievements, the selection criteria must also take into account the representatives' physical fitness, morality, and sports cultivation, so that they can continue to work hard and create superior records after returning home after the World Games, so that Chinese sports can make rapid progress, and it will not be in vain to attend the World Games this time. I (Ma himself) and Song Dong will lead the team back north on the first day of the month, while Yuan Lideng is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow (29th).</p>
<p>Dong Shouyi Talks About Basketball Talents</p>
<p>According to Dong Shouyi and Song Junfu, the basketball selection feels that China is very balanced in terms of front, center, and guard talents, and the strength is good. As for the official representatives, it must be decided after several battles with the strong Westerners in the city. This selection is completely based on talent as the standard, and will not be based on the winning group. No matter how strong a certain group is, it is inevitable that there will be weaknesses. On the contrary, there may be outstanding talents in the losing group. Therefore, this time we will select outstanding players from each team first, and then add appropriate training to increase the overall effort. If the strength is set to be based on the winning team, it will be more resident. In the future World Games, it may not be a smear.</p>
<p>Li Huitang Talks About Football Selection</p>
<p>According to Li Huitang, the opinion on the selection of football candidates to participate in the World Games is that in order to save travel expenses and avoid long journeys, the preliminary election is not necessary. Because this selection is purely based on talent as the standard, according to my speculation, the sports authorities have long recognized the individual skills at the National Games. The quota of 20 representatives is set, and about half of them can be occupied by Hong Kong and Guangdong. There are many good players among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and three or four people can also be obtained. The rest should be selected from East China and North China. After all the representatives are produced, my opinion is to gather in Hong Kong for training to increase cooperation. Before going abroad, come to Shanghai to compete for several games, and then compete with strong teams along the way to learn from each other. If we don't encounter strong enemies in the first game of the World Games in the future, we may be able to get more opportunities to play. If there are no special accidents at that time, I will be able to make the trip.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"He has never borrowed a penny from me in his life," Moore exclaimed, looking quite alarmed, because he had thought of what was going to be said next, and generally speaking, he would rather someone was using witchcraft, because he greatly admired Don.</p>
<p>"Maybe he took it," said Ned, who couldn't help but hold a grudge after being immersed in water, and since he was no different from the average boy, he was willing to repay him.</p>
<p>"Oh, Don!" cried Ned, clasping his hands together, still holding a half-buttered piece of bread.</p>
<p>"This is a painful matter, but I have to clear it up, because I can't have you spying on each other like detectives, making the whole school so uneasy. Did you put that foreign coin in the warehouse this morning!" Mr. Pei asked.</p>
<p>Don looked straight at his face and replied without hesitation, "Yes, I put it in."</p>
<p>Then the sound of whispering arose from all around, Tomo's water bottle accidentally fell and shattered; little May cried, "I knew it wasn't Ned who took it;" Nan began to cry, and Mrs. Shu left the room, looking so disappointed, melancholy, and ashamed, that Don really felt uncomfortable. He covered his face with both hands, and then straightened up, shrugged his shoulders, as if to take up the burden, and then said with a stubborn face, half firm and half reckless, the same expression he had when he first came:</p>
<p>"I did it; now you can do whatever you want with me, I don't want to say another word about it."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Securities. Last Day of This Month's Term. Bond Prices Experience Extreme Fluctuations. Initial Surge Due to Retailers' Compensatory Purchases, Followed by a Sharp Decline Due to Negative News. Zheng Liu (Product Six) Near-Term Intentionally Suspended Due to Price Drop. <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange resumed trading as usual after a week-long closure. The initial market price movement was almost entirely focused on the issue of interest rate cuts. At the same time, a decision was made to issue 120 million yuan of railway bonds. Moreover, as yesterday was the last day of January futures, the initial market price surged due to competition between long and short positions and because the news felt dull. Subsequently, the news turned negative, and the price fell. The good start of the market only lasted for one session, and it was not consistently strong. Therefore, as soon as the news changed slightly, the market collapsed. The issue of interest rate cuts has already become a widespread rumor. With the market at this final stage of fact or fiction, extreme price fluctuations are naturally to be expected. Today, only the February futures contract is being traded, and the trend is difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday, a total of three sessions were conducted. At the opening, retailers were very enthusiastic about buying. Major players only bought a lot of No. 11. Although selling pressure surged, the market price still rose sharply. The surge of 1.6 yuan for the Bian Yi (Product Change) was particularly high. This was truly a good omen for the New Year. The second session opened after 2 PM. Rumors spread that interest rate cuts were imminent, and market sentiment suddenly became weak. The selling of Nos. 16 and 21 was extremely strong. However, Nos. 32 and 79 were also quite actively bought. Therefore, initially, there was an indication that Bian Yi would recover after weakening. Since the market sentiment shifted to selling due to the troop reduction, the opening price was more than one yuan lower, and the downward trend became unstoppable. The gains from the first session were more than offset by the losses. The Zheng Liu (Product Six) fell sharply by 2.15 yuan. The closing session opened at almost 8 PM. Initially, trading was relatively stable. However, after No. 78 switched from buying to selling, market sentiment turned weak, and the downward trend gradually intensified. The January Zheng Liu (Product Six) was even suspended due to a price drop of over four yuan. Because the January futures contract was the last session, there were still many long and short positions that could not be settled due to the suspension. Disputes suddenly arose, delaying the closing for an hour. Since discussions were unsuccessful, the distant Zheng Liu (Product Six) and Jiu Liu (Product Nine) were not traded, and the market closed immediately. There should be more disputes today. As a result of the market price, most shares fell by several jiao to four yuan. Bian Yi, Tong Yi (Unified Tax), and Tong Shui (Unified Water) were slightly better, rising by 0.12 to 0.7 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 50 million yuan. The resulting price drops are listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e163">New York Stocks See Many New Highs <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 27th), the New York stock market initially rose and then weakened due to the final profit-taking by bulls. As a result, the market was mixed. Initially, speculators aggressively bought public utility stocks, pushing their prices to their highest levels since 1933. Subsequently, they switched to buying airline stocks and then concentrated on railroad stocks, pushing the railroad stock index to its highest level since 1934. Near the close, news of the passage of the soldiers' gratuity bill triggered a surge in commodity stocks. In the foreign exchange market, the US dollar opened strong but then fell sharply before recovering, apparently due to the manipulation of the stabilization fund. Trading in the small exchange was brisk, resulting in a slight increase. In the bond market, corporate bonds were active and slightly up, while government bonds fell. The total daily trading volume was 3.09 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>The yarn market reopened yesterday after a closure, but the trend is towards the downside. During this closure, the overseas cotton industry situation was mediocre, and the specie price was weak, leading to increasing apathy. Bull positions in the gold industry are exiting, and the market's chips are slightly looser. However, securities firms continue to add to their positions. Sales of existing yarn are said to be active.</p>
<p>Specie Yarn Changfeng Pours Out as Much as Possible.</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session, the specie price opened weakly and declined. Although public bonds rose in the first session, American cotton No. 3 remained the same as before the holiday. With negative sentiment, the bull positions were declared lost. Changfeng poured out as much as possible, resulting in a plentiful supply of chips on the table, and the market gradually declined. As a result, each month's closing price was 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 yuan lower than the closing price on January 18. The afternoon session opened and remained weak. Some argued that inventories had increased, and Changfeng continued to sell its bull positions. The market situation was flat. However, the short positions of Yuda made compensatory purchases. Nevertheless, the market remained lackluster. However, demand from existing yarn merchants was strong. As a result, each month's closing price was 0.4 to 0.8 yuan lower than the morning closing price. According to investigations, Mei Ji sold 1,000 bales, Ji 550 bales, He Xing 700 bales, Gengfeng 950 bales, Taichang 500 bales, Changfeng 4,700 bales, Xinhua 300 bales, Yukang 1 to 200 bales each, and Minghua 500 bales.

<p>The cotton market is depressed. During the seven-day closure, the situation for American cotton was stable, the trend for Indian cotton was weakening, and the yarn market was falling, leading to a weak market sentiment. Bull positions in the gold industry are exiting one after another, and the market situation is becoming weak. Each month has fallen by 0.45 to 0.7 jiao.</p>
<p>Specie Cotton Bull Positions Cut and Closed.</p>
<p>The specie cotton market opened at a lower price in each month in the morning session. Due to the poor yarn market, although American cotton was calm, Indian cotton was weak, and the yarn market was declining, cotton, which is closely related to yarn, was dragged into a depressed state. Changhe's bull positions were largely closed, and the market price became increasingly difficult to support. As a result, each month fell by 0.35 jiao compared to the closing price on January 18. The afternoon session opened and remained flat and weak. Overseas cotton South news continued to be bearish. Dachangcheng came to buy in large quantities again. As a result, each month fell by 0.15 to 0.2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. According to investigations, Gengfeng sold 1,900 dan, Runkang 4,100 dan, Shengyuan 1,100 dan, Changhe 7,800 dan, Changfeng 1,400, and Yikang 1,100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market situation was stagnant and weak, with each month falling by 1 to 7 pounds sterling. Traders were waiting for Washington's plans for the management of new cotton. Subsequently, news from Liverpool was unfavorable, and bull positions were closed. New Orleans and the South sold, and demand was sluggish. The market price softened. Fortunately, traders bought at limited prices in a sluggish situation, slightly improving the market. The textile market situation was volatile, and the closing price was flat and weak. Spot prices fell by 5 pounds sterling, and futures fell by 3 to 11 pounds sterling. Spot British cotton rose by 3 points, and futures rose by 3 to 6 points. Indian cotton, Euro-Xiang exporters sold off, and futures traders sold, and the market price was weak, with Pingguoer falling by 0.25 rupees, Aomula falling by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi remaining unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 27th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the predicted opening price for Bailuoxi cotton on the 28th was 202 rupees, a decrease of 0.75 rupees compared to the closing price on the previous day.</p>

<p>The flour market opened as usual in the morning and afternoon sessions. After opening prices, foreign wheat was quoted at a total of 234 jiao for several days, and Liverpool was about 1 1/2 pence. Market sentiment was based on the difficulty of matching foreign wheat and the lack of domestic chips. Both local and foreign cities were hoping for higher prices, so opening prices were all at 2-3 points. Later, this month's deliveries were active, and the month-end settlement was approaching. Buying interest was strong, and the market continued to improve. Forward trading was very active. However, many profitable bull positions were reversed, leading to a steady trend. June initially rose by 3-4 points, but then returned to flat. When the afternoon session opened, inland trades continued to buy, and the factories did not hedge, resulting in a uniform improvement in near- and long-term contracts, 1-2 points higher than in the morning. This month alone rose by 6 points, and long-term contracts improved by 1-2-3 points.</p>
<p>The wheat market initially rose and then weakened. Initially, foreign wheat was quoted slightly higher, and inventories were low, so buying interest was strong. Prices for each month were 2-3 points higher than before the closure. Later, profitable bull positions were gradually reversed, falling back by 1-2 points. When the afternoon session opened, trading became clear, but due to the morning's soft flour prices, sentiment continued to fall. Old bull positions continued to exit, and long-term contracts fell by 4-6 points. This month's contracts are nearing settlement, so there should be special changes. Long-term contracts have limited reserves, and small-scale volumes should also be limited. Existing wheat sales are still active. Because the factory's appetite for high-quality goods is still good, prices are rising by 5 points. Medium-quality goods are stable. It is said that Shandong Mingguang, Guandian, Yaowan, Luohe, and Shaheji are at 5.05 yuan, Danyang wheat is at 5.02 yuan, Zhumadian wheat is at 4.98 yuan, and Hankou wheat is at 4.85 yuan. Fuxin handled 2,000 packages, and Shenda handled 1,000 packages.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat: Large Canadian wheat reserves are an obstacle to price increases. The weekly supply reduction was 867,000 bushels, and the Canadian wheat reduction was 2,721,000 bushels.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Customer Xian Trading Still Quite Lively - The Opening of Local Rice is Expected to Be Around the First of the Month - <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Due to the poor situation in western Shanghai, the rice shops in Zhabei have generally ended their history. Few have a surplus, and most are just maintaining expenses. Due to the chaos and inconsistencies in the trade rules in the past year, the rules are being reorganized. The opening date has been greatly delayed to February 1. According to a survey of inventory by the same industry, the total inventory of white rice in each warehouse is about 280,000-290,000 packages, the inventory of thick, white, and pointed rice in each factory is about 20,000 stones, the inventory of customer-pointed rice at the station is about 100 cars, and the inventory of new arrivals from the river is rare this spring, only about 40-50. The boatmen on each road can be expected to gradually arrive tomorrow and the day after.</p>
<p>The customer Xian market is quite lively. In addition to the smooth handling of rice on this street, there is also communication with inland and rural areas. Moreover, there are not many receptions from the Shantou and Xiamen gangs yesterday, but the later appetite will remain, and the people's hearts are therefore hoping for a good situation. Judging from the current sufficient inventory and continuous supply, the market does not seem to have good signs. Now, with the launch of Shantou and Xiamen, and inland receptions, the market is particularly in need of prosperity. Even yesterday, the market rose by about 1 jiao because of the customer activity. 1,500 packages of Gan rice were opened for the whole day, 1,328 packages of Hankou Shashi, 400 packages of Jiangbei, and 2,519 packages of Wentaiyong. Except for 1,500 packages of Shantou rice bran and rice bran, most were handled by a few. The inland rural Xiamen are only decorative.</p>

<p>The leather market's red market is seeing rising momentum. Local and inland gangs, due to the red market, opened 20,000-30,000 packages throughout the day. It is reported that the sale price of Fuxin was 3.25 yuan for a net disk, and the sale price of loose cards was 3.2 jiao, and the Yangzhuang was not included. Most of them were eaten by customers on this street.</p>
<p>Recently, the foreign sesame market has been inactive, and the people's hearts are tired. Customers with existing goods are thinking about hedging. Therefore, the standard asking price is gradually softening. Inland and local customers have been trading smoothly, and the transaction is also strong. It is said that this month has fallen by 1 jiao 8 points compared with before the holiday, February has fallen by 2 jiao 2 points, and the later steps are like those of the foreign village, and there is still a tendency to continue falling.</p>

<p>According to old customs, the miscellaneous grains market opened the God of Wealth market yesterday, and the unified market transaction was quite lively. Except for yellow beans, which rose by 2 to 3 jiao compared with the closing market at the end of the big closing, the market prices of other miscellaneous grains all rose slightly by 3-4 points. There are thin stocks of yellow beans inland, and the source is temporarily unavailable, so the people's hearts are good. Local oil presses all have an appetite, it is reported that 5,000 bags of Luohe beans were opened, please refer to the market price to block the market price, 1,500 bags of Guide beans, 4,000 bags of Zhumadian beans, 8 cars of Zhengyangguan beans, 2 cars of Xinyangzhou beans, 300 bags of Dangshan beans, 1,000 bags of Luohe green beans, and other Zha beans were taken away by the local Wentai gang to take 2,000 bags, Du Dousha Huang, the local Nanyang division, and there is little grasp of the overall situation at the moment due to the red market transaction.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw tight customs duties, and it was the first transaction, so the trend of crude sand and white sugar was still good. However, red sugar was slightly softer due to the relationship with domestic sugar. The association divided the market into 24 coarse sand and white spot goods, which were sold at 22.65 yuan, up 2 jiao, and the transshipment goods were called up to 3 jiao, which was 7.6 yuan, which did not happen.

<p>I recently read an old magazine and saw twelve poems by Li Yinbai of Dantu, inspired by reading Wang Shuiyun's collection. Many of the phrases in the poems describe Shuiyun's life, such as "A qin master grows old in the world, sad when the palace moved north; unable to travel ten thousand rivers and mountains, a heartbroken person sings a heartbroken poem." It is recorded that Wang Shuiyun's name was Yuanliang, a qin artisan at the end of the Song Dynasty. His poems are filled with sorrow and thoughts of the lost nation. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he went north with the royal family and later returned south as a Daoist priest.</p>
<p>Liu Yiqing, Prince of Linchuan of the Southern and Northern Dynasties' Song Dynasty, wrote the "Shi Shuo Xin Yu," originally in eight volumes. Liu Xiaobiao of the Liang Dynasty annotated and supplemented it, expanding it to ten volumes. The current popular version has only three volumes. It is said that it was reduced to this size by Yan Shu of the Song Dynasty. I rather doubt why Yan Shu would discard such a large portion of it. I suspect that this book might have been mostly lost long before the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>When I was young, my late father used to show me twenty types of Kangxi coins with different characters on the back, saying to me: "These twenty characters appropriately form a five- or six-character poem, with each character representing a place." The characters are as follows: "Tongfu Lindongjiang, Xuanyuan Sujichang, Ninghenan Guangzhe, Taishan Guiyunzhang." Now, searching through my collection, the collected coins are scattered and incomplete. At this time of fragmented mountains and rivers, when the country cannot be whole, I recall old events, and I feel the same as these coins! (Qin sound)</p>
<h3 id="e176">Recording the Matter of Chen Shaoyang, a Student of the Song Dynasty <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>Liqin, in her youth, read the history of the Song Dynasty and, when she came to the part about Chen Dong, a student from Danyang, who was executed for writing a memorial to the emperor, she would often close the book and sigh, lamenting how, in ancient times, emperors were autocratic, channels of communication were blocked, loyal advice led to death, reaching such extremes! In the early summer of Yihai, I retired from teaching in Loudong and returned home to nurture myself, spending my days with books to pass the long days. When I came across the local chronicles and read Chen Gong's three memorials, I once again closed the book and sighed, greatly surprised that Chen Gong, at a time when treacherous officials were rampant, spoke frankly about current affairs, vehemently denounced powerful and treacherous officials, attacking them with his pen and words, fearlessly criticizing and impeaching them. His behavior inspired both awe and dread. It was fitting that he met his end by axe and execution, ultimately framed by wicked men. However, Chen Gong's loyalty was unwavering, his heart was with the country, and even with the cauldron of boiling water before him, he resolutely chose to speak his mind, encouraging the weak and establishing integrity. He was truly worthy of establishing a model of behavior for the Jin region, so that later generations would admire his integrity and look up to him, worthy to be compared with Jia Yi of Changsha. Since the Republic, foreign powers have invaded and humiliated us, devouring and encroaching upon us like whales and silkworms, growing deeper with each passing day. In past years, the people of the country felt chilled and often lamented the thorny copper camels. The many students, in particular, were deeply concerned about the destruction of the country and the extermination of the people. They have often gathered crowds to shout and petition the government. During the Jingkang period, the Song Dynasty was weak, and the Jurchens invaded, and the empire was as fragile as a thread. Yet the ministers and officials were secretly communicating with the foreign invaders, firmly clinging to the proposal of ceding territory and seeking peace. If the court had one or two people willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the country, they would be pushed aside and prevented from holding office, so as not to obstruct their treacherous schemes. Therefore, Chen Gong, as a commoner, led hundreds of fellow students from the Imperial Academy, prostrating themselves before the palace gates and submitting memorials, resolutely pleading for the fate of the nation. At that time, those who heard of it followed suit, reaching a crowd of tens of thousands of people. At that time, those who knocked and kowtowed beneath the palace gates, were spontaneously united, not like the premeditated gatherings of today's people, forming groups to act. However, driven by loyalty and a determination to save the country, both past and present, the motivation is the same. Therefore, I have often thought that Chen Gong's act of prostrating himself before the palace gates during the Jingkang period truly opened the prelude to the petition movement of the Chinese people, advocating for civil rights, unprecedented in history. Was Chen Gong perhaps the initiator of this? According to local chronicles, Chen Gong had a collection of writings in ten volumes, listed in the Siku Quanshu, but it is a pity that I have not seen it. I later heard from a local elder, Mr. Sui Zimeiyuan, that Chen Gong's former residence was in Yuetang in the county, only six or seven li from my home. I assumed that his descendants must have a copy of the collection. I often wanted to visit and borrow it to read, but I have not yet found a way. I happened to discuss this matter with my friend, Mr. Shen Xigong, who readily offered to help and borrowed it from his friend, Mr. Chen Shigang, to return and read it, so that I could enjoy viewing it. I am endlessly grateful to Mr. Shen. I also heard Mr. Shigang say: "Our Chen family, in the past, regarded Shao Yang Gong's third draft memorial from the Jianyan period as a family treasure. After the Taiping Rebellion, we regretfully lost its location. Only the handwriting remains, nothing more." In that case, the circulation of this collection must not be widespread, so I treasure it even more. I quickly asked Mr. Liu Zhizhong to serve as a copyist, and it took a month to complete the task. In addition, those not listed in the collection, as recorded in the local chronicles, were supplemented one by one. In the future, if others are found in other books, they should be further collected, hoping to collect them extensively and compile them anew, and plan to publish them. After the review is complete, I respectfully record a few words to mark it.</p>

<p>— Ru</p>
<p>Haining is a famous place for viewing the tide. Beside the embankment, there are also scenic spots such as the "Zhenhai Pagoda" and the "Zhenhai Iron Ox." People who come to Haining to travel inevitably admire and stroke them. However, the historically significant "Three Martyrs Pagoda" is often overlooked.</p>
<p>The Three Martyrs Pagoda is located beside the sea embankment, built to commemorate the martyr Pang Jingxian, head of the merchant corps during the recovery, and the martyrs Zhu Xizhou and Yu Xilin, members of the corps. At that time, due to the corruption of the Qing court's politics, pirates rose up along the coast of Zhejiang, and merchant ships were often looted by them. The livelihoods of the people were almost interrupted. And the Qing soldiers were lazy by nature and did not want to carry out the conquest, thus arousing the indignation of the head of the Pang corps, leading hundreds of newly trained merchant corps to the front to respond to the enemy. As a result, the pirates were pacified, and the head of the corps and the two members of Zhu and Yu, as well as many ordinary people, also sacrificed their lives for this reason.</p>
<p>This pagoda was built by merchants raising funds in October of the 17th year of the Republic of China. Although it is extraordinarily simple, it is very majestic when viewed from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Remembering Gu Yewang <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhen</p>
<p>During the Chen Dynasty, a great writer, Mr. Gu Xifeng, styled Yewang, stayed in his hometown of Tinglin. Gu was intelligent and studious from an early age, able to write at the age of nine, and once composed a daily rhapsody. At the age of twelve, he followed his father to Jian'an, where he was able to read many classics and historical records, so he was proficient in astronomy, geography, divination, and strange characters. Gu was not only erudite but also skilled in painting, so Gu's talent was very famous in Jian'an.</p>
<p>Later, when Hou Jing rebelled, Yewang observed mourning for his father and returned to Zhao to recruit villagers and follow the righteous army to rescue the capital. Gu was originally very thin and weak, and he also suffered the loss of his father, making him look even more gaunt. However, his heart for defending the country drove him to put on armor, hold a long spear, and perform the heroic act of giving up his pen to join the army. At that time, he explained the righteousness between ruler and subject and the principles of obedience and disobedience to those he led. His righteous indignation was very passionate, and everyone who heard it praised him. Although the result could not be saved, his loyalty and courage are worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>In his later years, Gu stayed in Tinglin, compiling local chronicles. The "Reading Pile" where he wrote every day still remains in his hometown. Gu died at the age of sixty-two. According to the Huating County Chronicle, his tomb is located southwest of Tinglin, but it is now impossible to find.</p>
<p>Gu's writings are extremely abundant, including the Wang Pian in thirty volumes, the National History Biographies in two hundred volumes, the Biography of Gu, the Jian'an Topography in two volumes, the Outline of General History, the Fushan Picture Preface in one volume, the Catalogue of Auspicious Images in ten volumes, the Sequel to the Dongmingji in one volume, and the Collected Works of Gu Yewang in two volumes.</p>

<p>He took them so far back into history before finally taking a seat. When Jia Duocai looked at Mr. Wang, he was wearing a blue cloth lined robe, with a bald head, a long, round, yellow face, and a lot of short, bristly whiskers. Although his clothes were very simple, his eyes were bright and shining, and he was still a worldly-wise man. Jin Ziqiang said that he was a loyal and honest elder, which was a little puzzling. So he nodded to him and said: "Mr. Wang, do you have a lot of land in this city of Xi'an?" Wang Baocheng looked at Jin Ziqiang first before smiling and answering: "What land do I have? It's just common land owned by the clan. The clansmen think that I can talk to the Easterners because I've been to Jiangnan once, so they pushed me to contact Mr. Jin." Jia Duocai said: "But I don't know what place this piece of land is?" Jin Ziqiang said: "It's just outside the North Gate, everyone knows that. That place will soon become a railway station. Our piece of land is very large, and according to insiders, it should be worth twenty thousand yuan there." Jin Ziqiang snatched a laugh and said: "Worth so much money there? Maybe that's ten years from now. Mr. Wang, don't listen to other people's gossip, it's just trying to cheat you. You know I'm a very straightforward person." As he spoke, he passed a cup of tea on the table to him. Then he smiled and said: "Have a cup of tea to moisten your throat first." As he spoke, he went to the bedside, took out a paper box from the net basket, put it on the table, and smiled: "This is chicken cake from Shanghai, although it's a little dry, it's still edible, please try some." As he spoke, he took a piece of chicken cake with two fingers, sent it to Wang Baozheng's hand, and smiled: "We're such good friends, why are you being so polite? We'll have many days of working together in the future." Jia Duocai saw this situation on the side, and his heart was very clear, so he asked Jin Ziqiang in a faint voice: "Brother Jin has already given a fixed price for the land?" Wang Shicheng had just taken a bite of the chicken cake: and immediately replied: "Including that piece of land in Xianyang, Mr. Jin only offered ten thousand yuan." Jin Ziqiang smiled and shook his head and said: "Such a large amount of money, Mr. Wang, do you think it's still very little?" (396)</p>
<h3 id="e180">Doubts from Worthies of Various Provinces <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jiaoxin</p>
<p>This article, published on December 28th of last year, listing the worthies of various provinces throughout history, makes me feel that there are some questionable points, which I would like to discuss with readers.</p>
<p>According to the list, there are three Yan Zhenqing, one from Shaanxi, one from Shandong, and one from Zhejiang. But in history, we only know that there was one Yan Zhenqing in the Tang Dynasty, who was from Zhejiang. Whether his place of origin is mistaken, or whether there are other Yan Zhenqing in Shaanxi and Shandong, is not very clear. However, Piyuanzai states: "Yan Zhenqing of Linyi, Tang Dynasty, styled Qingchen, was the Prince of Pingyuan during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. When An Lushan rebelled, he alone advocated righteousness to fight against him. After the rebellion was quelled, he was promoted to Minister of Justice and was enfeoffed as Duke of Lu. During the reign of Emperor Dezong, he comforted Li Xilie, held the imperial staff and refused to submit, and was strangled to death, with the posthumous title of Wenzhong. He was good at regular and cursive calligraphy, and his brushstrokes were strong, vigorous, elegant, and outstanding." According to this, Yan Zhenqing was indeed from Linyi County, Zhejiang. Why would there be one each in Shaanxi and Shandong? This is the first point of doubt.</p>
<p>Cao Cao of the Three Kingdoms has been regarded as a treacherous hero for thousands of years; heroes are certainly worthy of worship, but it is not appropriate to choose him as a local worthy when the word "treacherous" is added to the word "hero." Now Anhui has actually listed him, which seems somewhat inappropriate. This is the second point of doubt.</p>
<p>I hope that high-minded people will correct the above two points!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Chronicle of Dragon Sand Mountain <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Tianya</p>
<p>A few days ago, I had something to do in Jiangyin. Passing through Huashu Town in the eastern part of the county, I was invited by a friend to stay there for a night and visit several places. During the late Song and early Yuan dynasties, Huashu was a large town along the Yangtze River and a major market for cotton traded from places such as Nantong and Haimen in northern Jiangsu, so it was known as the "Flower Market." Later, sand and soil gradually rose on the south bank of the Yangtze River, and the distance between Huashu and the Yangtze River gradually increased. Now, it is thirty miles away.</p>
<p>Near the north side of the street, there is Dragon Sand Mountain and a Temple of Loyalty. Formally speaking, Dragon Sand Mountain is a small mountain less than ten zhang high, and the Temple of Loyalty is equally desolate and ordinary, not worth visiting, but because these two places are somewhat related to the glorious history of our nation, they should be recorded.</p>
<p>Halfway up Dragon Sand Mountain, there is a patch of grassland about five or six zhang square. This is where our national hero General Yan Yingyuan supported his elderly mother at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Now, the house is naturally gone, but the stone foundation around it is still clearly visible on the ground. General Yan's hometown was originally in Tongxian County, Hebei. He brought his elderly mother to Jiangyin, only to serve as a minor official (similar to the current head of the county public security bureau). He actually took on the heavy responsibility of resisting foreign invasions and saving the country. The result was naturally inevitable death, and all the people of the city, moved by his loyalty and righteousness, also died in defense of it. This is an even more tragic and painful event. Therefore, his heroic spirit and great achievements after his death, like Shi Kefa, who fought to the death in Yangzhou, and Huang Chunyao, who resisted the enemy in Jiading, shine brightly in history and will be remembered forever!</p>
<p>There are many pine trees on the mountain slopes. When the north wind sweeps through, the treetops make a desolate sound. Is that General Yan sighing for our dying nation?</p>
<p>Looking south for hundreds of steps, there is the Temple of Loyalty, where General Yan is enshrined. Because a small school has been established in the temple, the buildings of the entire temple are not very dilapidated. That day was a holiday, and the teachers and students were not in school. The clay statue of the general quietly sat in the alcove in the main hall, wearing a black gauze hat and a red robe, with a solemn face that made people dare not look directly at it. But this temple and statue were built in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. The clay statue may be somewhat different from his original appearance, but I believe it will not be very different, because the actions and outcomes of all passionate men are mostly the same, just like on the stage, those with green faces and red beards are mostly bandits, and those with white faces are mostly traitors. This symbolic representation may as well exist, giving people a deep impression.</p>
<p>In front of the courtyard there is a guava tree, with lush branches and leaves, and large, fragrant guavas shining with golden light. "The frost-covered skin of the old autumn is covered with honey and wax," which perfectly reflects General Yan's unwavering integrity.</p>
<p>My friend said: "Every year on the general's birthday (February 16th) and death anniversary (August 21st), in the past, all the people in the town would go to the temple to worship. Now, it is desolate. On those days, only some incense and candles are lit, and a few Taoist priests recite scriptures for a day." I think General Yan's greatness does not need incense, candles, and Taoist priests to praise him. It is perfectly appropriate for us to commemorate national heroes, but we must pay attention to the appropriateness of the methods and meanings. For example, if I walked to Dragon Sand Mountain without my friend's guidance, who would recognize that piece of leather was the former residence of a national hero?</p>
<p>When I left Dragon Sand Mountain and the Temple of Loyalty, the setting sun of dusk shone with a wisp of the most bleak light, and the pine wind blew coldly, making my heart feel infinitely desolate and lonely.</p>
<h3 id="e182">East Sea <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Shufan</p>
<p>Ten thousand rooms face the eastern sea, Gathering the fierce wind to protect the national gate. Endless are the tears of the Yellow Emperor over ruined tombs, Few are the traces of Kuazhou in the setting sun. The Central Plains yields with ceremony for three homes, Today, survival hangs on two words. Don't look down on Han Bai's armor from that year, He once led expeditions on the river.</p>
<p>Heavy snow flies, the wheels turning for five nights, Spring awakens from a disturbed dream. My chest and lungs, filled with sorrow, will grow horns, Tears flow, the rivers and mountains want to turn to ashes! Family sacrifices must not forget poems to the north, The country is desolate, but the phoenix may not come from the west? The students rush to write memorials, I have no money for a cup of wine.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Peacock Spreading Its Tail Feathers <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Qizhong</p>
<p>I have long heard people say that peacocks are competitive, saying that when they see a flower-like girl, they must spread their tail feathers to compete with her in beauty. I have always believed this without a doubt. I have seen many peacocks in the park, but I have never seen a peacock spread its tail feathers. I always thought that the people near me were not beautiful enough in the eyes of the peacocks. Three years ago, in Beiping, I saw the peacocks in Central Park, but they never spread their tail feathers, and I always thought that the people near me were not beautiful enough in the eyes of the peacocks. However, one day, I went to Central Park with several girlfriends, and one of my girlfriends was a "queen" from a certain university, dressed very beautifully, almost everyone had to give her a second look. The queen danced, several girlfriends sang, and the peacocks in the shed only paced back and forth and moved their wings and tail feathers slightly, but they still did not spread their tail feathers. Another time, I walked into Central Park alone, and the peacock happened to be walking outside the shed. I suddenly walked in front of it, spread out my coat, and waved the cane in my hand. The peacock hurriedly walked in, and at that moment it spread its tail feathers. I don't believe that my gray coat was considered beautiful in the eyes of the peacocks. At the same time, I looked at the wings and tail feathers of the peacocks after they spread their tail feathers, and every feather was trembling. I thought that the peacock spreading its tail feathers was not necessarily to compete in beauty, but perhaps it was fear.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, I had to walk through Dongyang Lane on Dixiwei Road in Hongkou twice a day, either going from home to the company or from the company back home. There are many empty foreign houses in Dongyang Lane. One house is uninhabited, and there is a turkey in the yard, which I think is raised by the owner of the neighboring house. Except for the feathers, I don't see much difference between turkeys and peacocks. I often saw many children throwing stones at this turkey by the iron gate. The turkey spread its tail, spread its wings, and quacked, with every feather trembling. But sometimes when there were no children nearby, it didn't do that. It can be seen that the turkey spreading its tail feathers was entirely due to fear. So, the peacock spreading its tail feathers, not to compete in beauty but to be frightened, seems to have some value in its establishment.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Shi Yousan "Wanted" But Not "Arrested" <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>Shi Yousan had been wanted by the Central Government, and Yin Rugeng had also been wanted by the Central Government. However, not only are these two men now "wanted" but not "arrested," but they also both have good official positions to assume. One is to be appointed Commander of the Beiping Security Force, and the other is to be appointed Mayor of Tianjin. This is a very comical thing amidst the national chorus of "Down with the traitors!"</p>
<p>Shi is one of China's old warlords. In the past, when he held military power, he was once very prominent. However, he finally failed. But even though he stepped down, he still has considerable latent influence in the north, so he has been quite active recently. Some rumors say that he is organizing some kind of army, or that he is promoting autonomy. However, some people also say that after he relinquished his military power, he has been living in seclusion and does not ask about external affairs. Shi himself has also recently defended himself to others, saying that he has always known only to be content with his lot, but he is often impersonated by others outside, taking illegal actions, causing him to be misunderstood by the people of the country. In fact, Shi's character, his merits and demerits to the country, have their own facts to prove, and enlightened people can see them early on. However, he is now highly valued by Song Zheyuan and will "make a comeback" as Commander of the Beiping Security Force. It is said that Shi once requested to be appointed a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. The authorities believed that Shi was skilled in "tactics," so they telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that his wanted order be revoked and that he be appointed to the post of Security Commander. I wonder how Shi will use his "tactics" after taking office? We ordinary people may as well monitor him from the sidelines!</p>
<p>What about Yin? He has also been showing off recently because he is said to be a "Japan expert," so the authorities appointed him as the Commissioner of the Ji-Mi District. We don't know much about his talent and knowledge. We only know that since he took office as Commissioner, he has gained the trust of "friendly nations" in diplomatic negotiations. However, this time his ambition is growing. He is not happy with the position of Commissioner, and he boldly raised the banner of rebellion in Tongzhou, relying on his background to seize the 22 counties of the war zone in one fell swoop and become the puppet leader of his pseudo-autonomous government! Unfortunately, the Chinese people today are not very easy to provoke. As soon as Yin's telegram was issued, the cry of "Punish the traitor" resounded throughout the country. Even his brothers were very indignant and advocated that he must be punished. It can be seen that his behavior of "selling out the motherland" is unforgivable. However, he has now become a "number one" important person, interacting very closely with a certain party, and has the potential to "rise rapidly." In the negotiations on the Jidong issue, it is said that the solution is for Yin to abolish the pseudo-organization, and for Song Zheyuan to telegraph the Central Government to request that he be exempted from the wanted order and that he be restored to his former position, or be appointed as Mayor of Tianjin. If this matter can be realized, then although the stock has not been able to get its wish, it is still good to have an official position after the rebellion.</p>
<p>In this day and age, what discipline, what prestige, are not to be taken too seriously. People like Shi Yousan and Yin Rugeng are sinners to the country and despised by the people of the whole country. But they have a great background after all. The authorities can not only do nothing about them, but also have to invite them to take important positions and serve the party and the country. However, once this precedent is set, a group of "active elements" can act recklessly in the future. If they succeed, they will be kings; if they fail, they will still have a place to go. Who would not want to take a risk? No wonder there are so many traitors in our country recently.</p>
<p>Chinese people's actions are always unpredictable!</p>
<h3 id="e185">Old Dream <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— A Ren</p>
<p>I opened my drowsy eyes, surrounded by pitch black. Shu's hand gently patted my shoulder. In the darkness, I could only see a small thing clinging to my ear like a bug, buzzing and saying to me, "A Ren, wake up! Something's wrong!"</p>
<p>"What?" I yawned, turning over. I could make out Shu's silhouette lying beside me.</p>
<p>Shu was already trembling with fear. Seeing me turn over, she buried her head in my arms without a word.</p>
<p>The situation was indeed strange. Before I closed my eyes and fell asleep, as I couldn't stay awake any longer, the entire cabin was brightly lit by three kerosene lamps. Now, even one lamp was extinguished. I listened carefully. Besides the boatman yelling "Quick, blow out the lights! Quick, blow out the lights!" in another cabin, Shu's mother and several old women were huddled in a corner of the cabin, chanting anxiously in low voices, "Amitabha, Amitabha."</p>
<p>Shu raised her wide eyes, shining in the darkness, and said to me, "Just as I closed my eyes to sleep, the boat suddenly shook, swaying back and forth a few times, and then stopped. We were just wondering what was happening when the boatman ran over from the stern, telling us to quickly blow out the lights and ordering us not to make any noise. He gave the same orders in the other cabins. See, everyone is shrinking back, waiting for an unforeseen disaster to befall us." After Shu finished speaking, she tightly gripped my hands and buried her head in my arms again.</p>
<p>Indeed, the sound of the engine was gone. The boat seemed to be asleep, lazily lying there. The rushing of the river water against the sides was like its heavy snoring, echoing in the terrifying darkness, pressing down on everyone's breath.</p>
<p>I was now fully awake. The old women's hurried, panting "Amitabha"s were truly laughable, but a sudden, unexpected terror, in the pitch-black, silent night, was strangely stabbing at my nerves.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one or two cannon shots rang out in the distance, shaking clearly in the deathly silent sky. I couldn't tell if they were from our country or the enemy, but I knew that we were already stopped in the war zone.</p>
<p>Shu and I sat up and pulled back the curtain on the small round window. Looking out over the vast, silver-scaled river surface, in that dark gray corner to the east, a storm of epochal significance was descending. That thunder, that lightning, that red fire, the generosity and anger vaguely visible in the fire, the broken limbs sacrificed for us, and the red blood rising with heat... the terror that had just assailed my nerves slowly disappeared at this moment.</p>
<p>The hurried panting of "Amitabha, Amitabha" gradually moved closer to me. Turning around, in the moonlight, I saw Shu's mother's anxious expression, her dry hands trembling as they held out a long robe.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, quickly take off your Western clothes and put on this robe. When the soldiers come later, they won't suspect you're a student and take you away."</p>
<p>I took the robe from her hand and looked at Shu's face. Shu's trembling mouth and eyes also pleaded for me to quickly change my clothes. Seeing that pitiful and shameful cowardly appearance, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"If I really am captured and killed by the soldiers, Shu, what are you going to do?" I asked Shu with a smile.</p>
<p>"I will never marry for the rest of my life!" Her voice carried a touch of solemnity.</p>
<p>"Never marry for the rest of your life?" Such an outdated, feudal idea was so deeply entwined in Shu. Why not immediately think of uniting the masses to avenge me? I began to feel melancholic.</p>
<p>For four years, this melancholy, like light smoke, has always, always lingered in my heart.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Night at Guanyin Bridge <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Qi</p>
<p>——Be careful at night; don't fall into a dead sleep, eh!</p>
<p>When it was time to sleep, Zhang, the head porter, came back to give this instruction again, his purplish-brown face covered with a layer of sternness.</p>
<p>The oil lamp dimly illuminated the contours of everyone's faces. Outside the window, the mountain stream sounded like an army of thousands hidden away. In the distance, an occasional echo, like the howl of a wild ghost, made everyone's hair stand on end. Everyone shared a common thought: "This terrifying night at Guanyin Bridge!"</p>
<p>The people traveling together gathered to hold a meeting. The air was filled with intense hope contained within the tension!</p>
<p>——We must divide into shifts to sleep and watch over the entire night! This is the final decision.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The first shift was assigned to A Huang, Xiao Liu, and Xiang Sen—three hours per shift.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, we should naturally be able to sleep soundly, but the air of terror stimulated our heartstrings. Who could possibly fall asleep? Listening, listening, we heard the three men's disordered footsteps in the courtyard, pacing back and forth. No one said anything. The night was as silent as the dead primordial era.</p>
<p>It was the time of the waning moon; the moon was invisible. The courtyard was as black as pitch. Sometimes, when the three of them stumbled on an unfamiliar path or bumped into the carrying pole or some other miscellaneous object, the sound would startle those lying in bed, subconsciously making them think of the arrival of bandits, or perhaps it would really be that way.</p>
<p>From under the eaves came a burst of snoring. The porters' expressions of "nothing else matters except myself" were actually quite endearing. They didn't think about anything beyond themselves. What filled their hearts was the resolution to find a way to live tomorrow.</p>
<p>The little desk clock clearly struck twelve. A Huang and the others handed over the shift. The second shift was supposed to be Chong, Lao Tie, and me, along with Broad-Mouthed Yang.</p>
<p>——How was it? No trouble, right?</p>
<p>——If there was trouble, that would be terrible. Just listening to any small sound would shatter our courage!</p>
<p>Without allowing any excuses, I shouldered the task. I thought to myself that the first half of the night would be easier to get through; the second half, though? That was hard to say. Bandits would mostly appear after midnight, wouldn't they? They would all have murderous faces. If they really appeared, then... I shouldn't think about that terrible scene!</p>
<p>——After our shift is over, it will be almost dawn. How will we be able to climb the mountain then?</p>
<p>This was indeed a question worth raising. The mountain road was so rugged and uneven, and it was the hot season. The weight on the porters' shoulders would often cause the purple-red blood streaks to stick to both ends of the bamboo pole. In this desolate, exiled region, they earnestly hoped that the travelers could show them some sympathy and climb some of the steep mountain roads themselves.</p>
<p>——Those on duty can sleep while walking on the road, A Huang said, suggesting that the original weight be reduced and distributed among the other burdens.</p>
<p>In the back courtyard, Lao Tie and I were bored, each occupying a corner and pacing around. The mosquitoes here were truly fierce. A swarm would fly over, humming a pleasant little tune in their mouths. Soon, our skin would be unbearably itchy. After rubbing it with a towel, we would feel as if we were burning up with heat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were footsteps on the street, mixed with some indistinguishable voices. Immediately, the three of us gathered together and hid beside the front counter. Slowly, they got closer and closer. Judging from the sound, there were more than five people.</p>
<p>——It's here, it's here. We haven't been here before! said someone with a strangely rough accent to the others.</p>
<p>The three of us started to tremble. How should we deal with them? Being soft wouldn't work; being hard—they had more people, and we had so few weapons. How could we resist them? Fear? Retreat? We were completely trapped in a circle of bewilderment.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, several people had already entered the shop, shining flashlights all around. The things hanging down from their waists—weren't those Mauser pistols for showing off? In the mutual illumination of the flashlights, I noticed that the people were not wearing headscarves or any tight-fitting jackets. From the symbols on their collars, I realized that they were local militiamen, charged with maintaining security.</p>
<p>——Whose sedan chairs and belongings are these? someone asked.</p>
<p>——Ours, Lao Tie jumped out to tell him, also saying some of the usual things about where we came from and where we were going.</p>
<p>He didn't seem to believe Lao Tie's words very much. In his mind, he probably thought that the sudden appearance was impossible. Afterward, he looked at the flag stuck on the carrying basket, nodded, said some polite words, and left.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps disappeared in the distance. The long street was still as silent as before.</p>
<p>We quietly stepped back into the backyard. The mosquitoes were still playing their little tunes, the grasshoppers were singing loudly, and a few drifting clouds floated westward. The sky was entering the stage of dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Rushing the Journey <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>In the evening, the villages and towns of the South lightly wear the weary sunlight, which contains boundless coolness. The villagers, in pairs and in groups, who had entered the market have already taken their goods home sparsely. The markets and narrow streets have become quiet. We, a group of young people, could no longer linger in this small town, and were preparing to go to the area of Kaiping.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the Baisha market is a long path through fields and caves. The golden plains and bamboo forests gradually became dark. Gusts of cold wind swept across our hearts. In this countryside, which was quickly rolling into darkness, our group of strangers couldn't help but feel anxious:</p>
<p>"It's still a three-hour bus ride to Xiangang! It's getting dark!" the leader said.</p>
<p>When we ran to the bus station, there was still a bus parked there. The driver and the people in the factory seemed to dislike us, frowning and muttering at us:</p>
<p>"The bus isn't running. You didn't come earlier. It's getting dark."</p>
<p>"Why isn't it running? Aren't you helping the National Salvation Propaganda Team? We must get to Xiangang!" Guan Jun said in their local dialect, and then comforted us, "Don't worry about these profiteers! We'll sit in the carriage and won't leave until the bus leaves. Victory is ours."</p>
<p>Amidst the muttering, three passengers boarded the bus. We breathed a sigh of relief and squeezed into the carriage. The driver reluctantly started the bus, but it drove very slowly. The uneven road threw the bus, along with us, up and down. Our hungry stomachs were also turning somersaults. At that time, looking out of the carriage window, all we saw was a hazy night that had tightly enveloped the mountains and fields. The sky became darker and darker, and our spirits became more and more tense.</p>
<p>At a fork in the road, the bus suddenly stopped, which startled us a lot. Then, the three passengers got off because they had reached their destination and left triumphantly. The skinny driver also breathed a sigh of relief cunningly:</p>
<p>"The bus can't go any further. Our bus only goes this far. The next section of the road belongs to another company. Our company has no right to drive on it. There will be a bus coming in a while."</p>
<p>When we saw this situation, we couldn't help but feel angry. Guan Jun shouted:</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Are you trying to deceive us? Let's drive the bus ourselves!"</p>
<p>However, no one knew how to drive a bus, and in this dark night, in the wilderness where we couldn't see anything at all, how could we rush the journey? So, we roared with anger:</p>
<p>"Let's smash this bus! We can run there. It's only twenty li from here to Xiangang." Then, we were about to take action and pressure the driver: "Do you want to be a slave of a fallen country? Don't you know about the loss of the Northeast and the fighting in Shanghai? You're ashamed to be a Guangdong person!"</p>
<p>Shouting; the fire of us young people started to burn.</p>
<p>At this time, we looked . . . what did we see? The black masses of the distant mountains and fields . . . unfolded in darkness. The whistling wind . . . The weeds on both sides were just shrinking back . . . There were also a few light barks of dogs coming from the distant mountain villages. A wave of terror rose in our hearts, as if we were worrying about having stepped into a den of robbers. Looking at everyone's tense faces, full of anger and terror, in the darkness, some were still trembling.</p>
<p>The bus still sped towards the black, paint-like mountains and fields, jumping up and down, tossing our hearts. We were still shrinking back in the carriage, looking at each other, not having felt any relief from the terror.</p>
<p>As if we had found light, when we arrived at Xiangang, in the quiet station, under the dim yellow light, we saw a group of children and two teachers waiting for us. Moreover, they were shouting:</p>
<p>"Welcome the National Salvation Propaganda Team!"</p>
<p>The pleasant enthusiasm in our hearts started to burn again.</p>

<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening Piece</p>
<p>City Sound (1340) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM Opening Piece "New Year Song"</p>
<p>Light soup and spring breeze harmonize, ten thousand families set off firecrackers and ten thousand families beat gongs. The New Year's fourth day follows the fifth day. The Five Roads Wealth Gods are greeted aplenty. Fortune, prosperity, and longevity are all there. Chicken, fish, and pork fill the plates. Pine needles, cypress branches, and evergreen leaves—it is essential to bid farewell to the old year and welcome the gods. Ten thousand households and thousands of doors all respect and value them. The Roadhead Bodhisattva has no skill. Poor families may not personally arrive, but Lucky Profit and Wealth Summoning substitute them. With candles and incense, they often arrive. Without tea or wine, they are cold and aloof. The True Yi Xuan Tan is ultimately afraid to come. Gold, comfort, and satisfaction do not covet the picture. My family is receiving the Wealth Gods today. I do not care about the Dragon Boat Festival on the fifth day. I heard that Zhong Kui is marrying off his younger sister. The Roadhead Bodhisattva asks for a wife in verse. From this, it is known that Doctor Zhong's closest kin are brother-in-law and brother-in-law both call each other. Wife's brother, younger sister's husband, naturally there are matters to discuss and help with. Surely they will call their brother-in-law on their birthday, arranging a public share to play songs and music. The Ministry of Wealth and Silver also has a share. Everyone definitely does not look down on me. A great source of wealth comes quickly like a shuttle.</p>

<p>Hua Mei (1060) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM Opening Piece "New Year"</p>
<p>Yesterday the Roadhead was received a lot, and today everyone is drinking Tusu wine. Fathers are kind, sons are filial, families are blessed. People are safe, things are rich, and interest is abundant. Young masters and grandsons ride dappled horses. Fair ladies and women worship Amitabha. Zhuangyuan picture, promotion picture, Lantern Festival running horse show, ten-course gongs. Congratulations are sent with name cards. Etiquette is diligent, how dare one be negligent. Everyone says that the Jiangzhe province is the norm, and the reputation of literature and relics allows the three Wu. Wealth and poverty are determined by heaven, what does it matter. Countless illuminated boats pass through Shantang. There is singing and music everywhere in the streets. The sound of the song slowly floats and sings in the wind, singing out the most wonderful feelings of longing. Sixteen thousand is easy to pass. Life is only suitable for living in Suzhou. Until now, beautiful sentences praise Dongpo.</p>

<p>Sino-Western (1040) Midnight 12:15 AM to 1:00 AM Opening Piece "Playful Spring Words"</p>
<p>All day long, I search for spring but cannot find it. It turns out it is illusory and shapeless. Cold plums happily announce the arrival of spring first. Spring arrives, and the scenery of Jiangnan is new. I say, the great earth's spring truly has feet. It leaves the spring emperor to live in the spring city alone. But that, the spring breeze in the village is chilly, and the spring cold is heavy. Spring rain is continuous, and spring hatred is deep. I am exactly, the spring painting is sleepy, and the spring mood is lazy. It is good to let that, the spring shade secretly protect the crabapple heart. I am only afraid that, the wind and rain will come at night, and the spring flowers will weep. Spring is on the branches, afraid to hear the crossbow. Until this morning, the spring sun brings warmth, and the spring atmosphere moves. Boundless spring fills the garden. Cut vegetables after the rain add spring bamboo shoots. Link the spring plate with non-pungent spices. It is just right, the newly split Xiangtou spring brew is ripe. The spring officials' peach and plum feast is at the door. At times, go out to seek traveling spring companions. Rain washes the spring suburbs, and green grass grows. I only fear the muddy spring will prevent us from slipping. I see, the green spring clogs imprint fragrant moss. Gazing far, the spring water of the green waves rises with the help of poles. The light black spring mountains fill the city. I also see, at the corner of the spring flag where wine is sold. Investigate flowers, spring is warm, sell tin sounds. Only because, the spring is late in March, the oriole dreams. Spring news is frequently transmitted by island warbling sounds. Spring clouds are empty and sad. The willows rely on each other, short and long pavilions. What can be done, the mad bees and butterflies are spring and mischievous. Flowers fall in the late spring, unattached feelings. I only blame that, until death, spring silkworms are bound by silk. Spring clothes want to be wet and touched by dust. I worry that, spring returns, spring easily urges people to age. I fail to live up to the spring light, and I feel sad. After the fallen flowers cover the ground, spring is gone. Spring sunshine is happily staying, and the years are startling. At that time, flowers bloom and fade, spring is masterless. I only feel, when spring swallows return, where to seek. Since ancient times, grieving over spring, Du Mu. Spring sorrows are obscure and most soul-destroying. Try to ask him, whose dream of spring belongs to.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Anecdotes of "Wedding Night" <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>"Wedding Night" is the most valuable production of Yihua Company in 1936. It is Yue Feng's most elaborate and greatest masterpiece after "Escape."</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" suggests the most personal problems of two young men and women, but one is a forced marriage oppressed by autocratic forces, and the other is a free love built on materialism.</p>
<p>"Which young girl does not cherish spring?" "Wedding Night" grasps this point, dissects the psychological state of a young girl in puberty, and the actions of love and desire induced by it, so "Wedding Night" is equal to a youth reader, and also equal to a love scripture.</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" is also like a pot of candied fruit, a bottle of aged vinegar, a plate of pepper, and a dish of mustard sauce, both sweet and sour, both bitter and spicy.</p>
<p>"I'd rather die than be unfree!" Yuan Meiyun struggles in "Wedding Night" for the sake of love and the evil environment, but in the end, she is still a lamb unable to resist!</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" has extremely complicated love tangles, such as Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin, Wang Yin and Lin Ling, Lin Ling and Zhang Boli, then Yuan Meiyun and Guan Hongda, Guan Hongda and Zhou Xuan, Zhou Xuan and Liu Li, etc. As the plot unfolds, these vortexes of love are like wind and waves, with layers of waves and infinite changes.</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" is a film that everyone should watch, with extremely good intentions. Young ladies and loving couples will feel as comfortable as eating a cup of ice cream after watching it, and their hearts will bloom. As for older ladies, after watching it, it is like eating a piece of sandalwood olive, the more you chew, the more flavorful it is, and the more you chew, the sweeter it is.</p>

<p>The story of "Peach Blossoms After the Calamity" takes place in Qingdao. It writes about the vicissitudes of this fairyland-like idyllic resort, from Qingdao's German lease period, through Japanese jurisdiction, to China's reception and reunification. The film has changed three different national emblems. --Here, we see the joys and sorrows of people, and we also see the cicadas' cicadas' state affairs, and we see the old dreams of the rise and fall of this embroidered country.</p>

She not only possesses a talent for singing and dancing but also has all the necessary qualities of a film actor. In the past, she has appeared on the silver screen, although she was not able to fully showcase her talents. However, people generally hold a kind of hope for her. She has been chosen for an important role in Sun Yu's "Back to Nature." We believe: past events have proven that under the direction of Sun Yu, a new actor often achieves great success.</p>
