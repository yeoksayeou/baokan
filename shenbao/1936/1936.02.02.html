<p>— 華</p>
<p>近數日來。因為英國故皇喬治奉安新皇愛德華登基。歐洲各國要人。衆集倫敦。其中最重要者。除了歐洲幾個君主國的元首之外。有法外長佛蘭亭、德外長·牛賴斯。蘇聯外長李維諾夫。奧國執政者斯泰侖堡親王。以至匈牙利·南斯拉夫·捷克·及羅馬尼亞的外長等等。這許多外交要人。不約而同的蒞臨倫敦。在表面上。他們的目的是半為弔唁。半為道賀。但在普通的酬酢之外。他們的會晤將發生重大的外交上的意義。</p>
<p>過去一年中歐洲政局的動盪。已產生一個重大的影響。卽歐洲政治的重心。漸由巴黎轉移到倫敦。特別是德國重整軍備以後。英國在德法兩大集團之間。獲得了舉足重輕的地位。同時它就利用這種地位以左右歐洲的局勢。增強其本身的力量。然而這種巧妙的帝國主義外交的法。結果也召致了相當的危機。德國空軍的秘密擴張。威脅到萊茵河以西。是危機的一種。意國的稱兵東非。威脅到地中海紅海上的航路。是危機的又一種。意阿戰爭的延不解決。和希脫勒備戰氣燄的逐漸囂張。使英國統治者感覺到要利用歐洲的均勢搖動以自肥。也並非易事。於是在不久以前的英法協定中。英國表示了外交上的一些讓步。但這種讓步也就是以退為進的表示。目前英國最感到迫切需要的。是緩和意阿戰爭所引起的危機。日來在倫敦的外交酬酢中的主要意義。就是英國企圖調整整個歐洲國際間的均勢。以加強其解决意阿問題的立塲。</p>
<p>現在英國的外交活動。正從兩方面進行着。第一。緩和德法間因萊茵河地帶武裝問題而引起的危機。英國要法國和它共同對意。根本條件就是它要能和法國共同對德但是最近英法協定成立後。德方立刻發生強烈的反響。表示要恢復萊茵河地帶的武裝。這不但是法國所深懼。也是英國所不願的。日萊艾登與牛賴斯的會晤。主要當在打消德國的這種威脅。第二。安定中歐的局勢。緩和奧匈與小恊約各國間的衝突。這方面的外交活動也許將產生一個重要的副作用。卽奧國的從親意轉到親英。英國在地中海上已經受到了意國的威脅。現在它將從意國的背後還給它一個威脅。</p>
<p>在上述的外交活動之外。李維諾夫的進見英皇。和蘇聯陸軍次長杜卡乞夫斯基的暫時留駐英倫。則又另有重要的外交上的意義。李維諾夫和艾登會晤。特別提到德國凖備恢復萊茵河地帶的武裝的危險。這是呌英國留心着。口口聲聲喊着反蘇聯的國家。對於帝國主義世界本身也是同樣的危險物。不要上了當。在歐洲的集體安全運動中。蘇聯是一個重要的支柱。在對意制裁中。蘇聯對於英國幫了不少的忙。現在它也要測騐一下英國在對付其他戰爭挑釁者的時候。是有多少的誠意了。這測騐的重要性不僅限於歐洲一處。在東亞也是大有作用的。</p>

<p>維也納　本社訪員訊、德國國社黨秉政第四年度、適已開始、但就奧國之內政外交而言、則希特勒夙所標榜之德奧合併政策、已顯見失敗、以內政而言、各種職業團體之組織、已使故總理陶爾斐斯所創行之立法制度、漸臻鞏固、近且在常軌之上、進行無阻、例如統一工會、已有會員三十萬人、卽當全國工人百分之四十、前此社會民主黨、業已網羅全國工人百分之八十左右、今則已有一部份加入統一工會之內、此外愛國陣錢亦復順利推行、其中包有鬥士二百萬名、換言之、全國成丁百分之四十五、卽在此團體之內、至於總理休樞尼格與副總理斯帶倫堡親王所主持之內閣、現亦安如磐石、不獨閣員之中、無有意見衝突之處、卽全國軍隊、亦復一致擁護、絕無間言、此項軍隊之中、受過軍事訓練者、現有十萬人之多、從前在陶爾斐斯故總理之時、則僅民團三萬人耳、似此奧國國社黨、苟無德國軍人爲之援助、已如强弩之末、而無能爲力、若輩僅於掩旗息鼓之中、從事宣傳耳、惟由最近該黨所發生之一事伴而觀、則知該黨黨徒、在奧國境內、猶有一種恐怖性質之組織也、决以外交而言、則該國對於實施制裁辦法婉詞反對、一面雖力保對意友誼、然一面頗知獲取英國與小協商諸國之同情、例如奧國銀行、遭遇困難、英國已允與奧國開始談判、以保障該銀行前途之安全、此外、全國愛國情緒、重見昂揚、忠君之觀念、亦因是而激發、目前上自當道、下及庶民之一大部份、均主張哈布斯堡舊皇室重登大寳、此在南斯拉夫、捷克、羅馬尼亞三國、與德國元首希特勒、則均在所反對、其中希特勒反對允力、南斯拉夫亦不容變通、今者保皇黨正擬與南斯拉夫、捷克、羅馬尼亞三國、設法進行磋商、擬覓一妥善辦法、捷克與羅馬尼亞兩國態度、已稍見和緩、惟希特勒之態度、未必有何變遷、因而今後欲覘知奧國復辟運動之前途如何、當先揣知、德國元首希特勒對此舉所採之政策如何、以爲斷也云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>南菲總理贊成國聯行動　足以保障小國</h3>
<p>南菲開浦城　南菲聯邦總理赫査格將軍、昨日在國會發表演說云、「國聯會處理意阿爭端所採行動、乃在維護弱小國家之獨立、此在本國政府視之、實乃集體行動上最偉大之企圖、意國憑其强大之兵力、以侵犯阿國、茲若任其所爲、則影響所及、凡人口過剩之國、均必起而效允、羣謀染指於世界土地遼闊之國、南菲洲聯邦、亦卽土地遼闊之國、屆時亦難倖免矣云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞京城　此間今日得悉、意國曾以外幣購買煤油、自去年十一月中、國聯對意制裁起、卽陸續輸入、至於日內瓦消息謂意國所購煤油、足敷本年全年之用、而其來源則爲羅馬尼亞云云、則此間不甚置信、因意國缺乏適當之儲油設備、且如國聯通過煤油禁令、羅國亦未必能繼續供給云、（卅一日國民電）</p>

<h3>競爭白熱化的日本『選舉肅正』（二）</h3>
<p>— 衡之</p>
<p>——作爲「非常時」中戰爭準備的過——</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>解散會議的行動及今天正競爭着的選舉，都應作爲戰爭準備的一種過程來看。</p>
<p>現內閣反對黨的政友會多半是關心三井財閥這一系統之利益的。現內閣與黨的民政黨則多關心三菱財閥那一系。政友會現有選舉競爭費百五十萬元左右。民政黨也差不多。在初選時，政友會被選出二百四十餘名。民政黨的相差三四十名。所謂「大的」，是因選舉有弊，所以未便確定。此二大黨都在爭取多數。其他如國民同盟，昭和會，社大黨（左右翼）只各占十來名。議員總數現定四百六十六名。</p>
<p>看一看各黨派的競選政綱吧。看此競選政綱，同時也就明白前議會解散的內幕，及各派間的矛盾。</p>
<p>據日本東京朝日新聞一月二十三日發表的各派競選政綱如下：</p>
<p>政友會：</p>
<p>打破官僚中心的假裝的「全國一致」，確立政黨的責任政治，安定動搖的政局，照應內外非常時而實現足以進行一貫政策的强力內閣。</p>
<p>排擊現內閣的，以國防爲中心而閑置產業關係的跛脚財政政策，當使國防產業兩全。在此意味上推翻那籍口於健全財政的，取法於消極主義的公債漸减方針；當依據公債財源，在國策遂行上，急行根本的財政改革。</p>
<p>同時，政友會駡民政黨是官僚的爪牙。現內閣對於倡天皇機關說的美濃博土自由主義者們的査辦不澈底，政友會認爲「國體『本義』自肇國以來便是萬古不渝的」，所以「國體明徵」曾成爲政友會攻擊現內閣的武器。現在又成爲競選題目之一。</p>
<p>綜合政友會的競選口號是：</p>
<p>（一）官僚乎？政黨乎？</p>
<p>（二）假裝之舉國一致乎？眞正之舉國一致乎？</p>
<p>（三）安定乎？不安定乎？</p>
<p>（四）跛行乎？兩全乎？</p>
<p>（五）積極乎？消極乎？</p>
<p>（六）景氣乎？不景氣乎？政友會政策：</p>
<p>（一）積極自主外交之貫澈，經濟外交之充實。</p>
<p>（二）制度改革——矯正玩弄身分保障，流於怠慢驕傲的官僚風氣</p>
<p>（三）爲救濟地方財政當確立地方財政調整制度。</p>
<p>（四）作爲產業對策，應圖消費的合理化，動力運費之低下，試騐研究機關之整備。務期治山，治水等之澈底。同時提倡以下諸政策：</p>
<p>（甲）根據前議會以來的方針，解决米，繭，肥料問題；（乙）實行以地方自治之經濟强化爲基礎的農村更生；（丙）設置相當大規模的商工中央金庫；（丁）爲適應下述原則；增進產業統制及公共利益，使產業健全發達，創設長期的中央統制委員會。</p>
<p>（五）財政政策，卽兵農兩全主義。此外，反對在選舉中政府以「官」權及「全」權壓迫他們。</p>
<p>民政黨是支持現內閣的；在要打開「非常時局」一點上，也高呌舉國一致主義。其十大政策爲：</p>
<p>（一）排擊法西斯，確立憲法政治：</p>
<p>（甲）絕滅法西斯風潮，（乙）革新並强化政黨，（丙）肅正選舉，求民意暢達之澈底。</p>
<p>（二）通商之自由，資源之開發，人口分布之合理化及確立以東亞安定爲根幹的自主的外交政策：</p>
<p>A鼓吹國際的共存共榮，</p>
<p>B東亞安定之確保，</p>
<p>（三）樹立以東亞安定爲目標的經濟的而且是自主的國防計畫：（甲）科學的兵備强化，（乙）防空航空施設之充實，（丙）各種艦艇的自主的整備，（丁）造艦競爭之防止。</p>
<p>（四）產業，國防，財政之三全强化；（甲（預算分配之合理化，（乙）國防之地方工業化，（丙）民間航空事業之獎勵，（丁）公債政策之確立，（戊）綜合的產業政策之樹立。</p>
<p>（五）進取的貿易政策之確立及綜合的科學研究所之設置：（甲）輸出組合之普及澈底化，（乙）輸出補償之地域及補償條件之擴充並强化……海外資源之確保，優秀船之獎勵助長……</p>
<p>（六）農村更生對策之澈底；（甲）負債整理之普及澈底，（乙）負擔之均衡，（丙）收入之安定，（丁）治山治水事業之遂行。</p>
<p>（七）地方財政調整交付金制度之確立。</p>
<p>（八）佃田制度之改善及自耕農之擴大並强化。</p>
<p>（九）中小商工業之組織化及低利放欵之貫澈。</p>
<p>（十）中小商工業及產業組合之調整：（甲）爲打開中小商工業者之窮狀而創設商工中央金庫，由此金庫給與金融互助之便，（乙）農村經濟更新當以產業組合爲中心，（丙）整理各種產業組合之指導監督機關。</p>
<p>其口號是：</p>
<p>一、兵產財三全强化。</p>
<p>二、大衆層生活安定。</p>
<p>三、農商工共榮依存。</p>
<p>民政黨對於政友會的反擊；</p>
<p>一、舉國一致乎？政權爭奪乎？</p>
<p>二、國本本位乎？「黨略」本位乎？</p>
<p>三、建設乎？破壊乎？</p>
<p>此外，國民同盟則高唱「日本主義」，主張「國防外交一元化「，提出五項：</p>
<p>（一）國防，外交及「國論」之一元化——要使作爲東亞安定勢力的日本行動有効，軍事行動及外交行動就不可不一致。</p>
<p>（二）對於激增的人口之職業分配——市塲確保，原料獲得，動力費遞减，工業之農村分佈等各種政策是必須實行的。</p>
<p>（三）爲保持民族優秀性的衛生國策之遂行——主張設置保健省（卽保健部）。</p>
<p>（四）荼毒國民精神的腐敗行爲之排擊——近年來官吏公吏及政黨員之犯罪已顯著增加，爲防止這些，立法的整備，行政的監督及政治家之出處進退，也是有重大關係的。</p>
<p>（五）國民負擔之均衡——明治以來的重工商主義，終於使國富集中到都市來，最簡單的證明是，對於國稅的地方稅負擔之比，照目前的負擔比例，爲日本中堅層的地方中產階級就有衰亡的情勢。</p>
<p>昭和會是主張舉國一致，擁護高橋財政的。昭和會的政綱大體與現內閣當初組閣時發表過的十大政綱相同——綱紀肅正，民心振作，</p>
<p>國際親善，國防安全，財政確立，生活安定，綜合的產業政策，敎育刷新，行政改善，共存共營的對滿方針。</p>
<p>無產陣營的社大黨是特別要排擊法西的。他們以加入會議爲一種排擊的戰術。在會議裏，他們可以說出平常時不敢公開說出的話。在會議裏，旣成的政黨如政友會及民政黨，他們對於戰爭問題及軍費問題，只敢使用兵農兩全這類糢糊言語，他們對於那些問題是迥避批判的。但他們（政友，民政）是主張擁護議會政治的，所以，運用他們這一點，强化反法西的運動也很有必要。爲此，能爲批判的無產陣營就更敢地走入獨自的議會鬥爭了。在無產陣綫裏，也有左右兩翼及中間派之別，這雖然能在行動上有厚薄的差異，但在今日努力着的「戰綫統一」之下，比散漫着的時期似要强有力些。這也就是此决總選中最有興味的一點。</p>

<p>在冀察政委會未正式登台表演之前夕、第三者自欺欺人、在「民衆自動」烟幕下、積極的策動各色之劇團、計有所謂「華北自治促進會」·「華北農村救濟會」·「中華人民自治聯席會」·「河北各縣代表聯席會」·「保障東亞和平大同盟」·河北新自治政府」·「中國防共聯合會」·以及「冀東防共自治委員會」等等、名目雖甚繁多、實皆一邱之貉、各劇台上、雖各有相當活動、如雇抽大烟·吸白面·打嗎啡·之貧民乞丐、每人每决、給洋四角、分乘汽車、結隊遊行、假意向官方請願自治、藉以淆亂世人觀聽、驟視其外表之形形色色、亦像煞有介事之熱鬧、究共內幕實情、彼輩傀儡醜角、無一而非「××特務機關」、與趁火打刦之頭等漢奸、在後台提動其綫索、然此尙不能謂為巳盡導演之能事、已畢劇情之大觀焉、蓋醜劇導演渚之目的、表情之要點、在乎如上述「中國防共聯合會」者、為防共請日本出兵、曾秘密上書云、「（上略）今共匪已由新甘蒙陜東進、束亞防共戰綫不穩、華北反共兵力薄弱、日若坐視、華披靡矣、赤禍何堪設想、必須貴國出兵聯勦、乃有協力肅淸之望、迫切陳詞、敬乞鑒察」云云、詞意荒謬絕倫、莫此為甚、又如股逆犯天下之大不韙、所組偽「冀東防共自治委員會」、甫逾一月、又更改偽名為「冀東防共自治政府」、認賊作父、截留國地各稅、（每年地方稅二百八十餘萬元、省稅二百餘萬元、中央稅五百餘萬元、合計年達千萬餘元）、不僅割據國土、破壞財政經濟、倘與關係方面交涉取消問題、且反提出改組冀察政委會、而為「冀察防共會」之條件、第三者手段之毒辣、用心之陰險、可謂達於極點矣、</p>
<p>要之、日本對中國之外交手段、雖花樣百出、正奇互用、而政策之始終一貫、初不因人因地而異、惟目前伸向華北之魔掌、綜觀决定恢復靑濟駐軍、增加平律駐軍、添設綏遠·太原·特務機關、强化冀東·察北·交涉間題等等、顯係假借防共反蘇之盾牌、進謀武力控制我華北、亦卽各別分化我國政治單位、以完成逐步統制全國之一貫政策、獨撑華北半壁之當局、對於「鄰之所厚、卽我所薄」、「敵欲割裂、我利統一」之理勢、當不至或欠圓到之認識也、</p>
<p>尤有進者、近頃發生「塘沽」及「朝陽門」事件其簡要情形一係塘沽奸商販運私貨、被警察緝獲、某關係洋行、欲作無理之袒護、竟毁旗栽贓、强誣為侮日行為、一係北平朝陽門、入夜關門後、突有日兵數人、執令開城而入、守兵因手續關係、開城稍緩、對方不滿、旋發槍示威、守兵雖亦迎天還擊、然皆無傷、對方意在尋釁、故亦列為交涉問題、兩事是非曲直、昭然若揭、顧日本駐平在鄕軍人會、猶發表宣言、認先此為抗日反「滿」之事態民、斷難默視、而某方更認為「如宋軍因日方寬厚態度、而長其驕矜、致重演侮日行為、則除出於積極的手段、而斷予排擊之外、別無他法」、此種「趙孟能貴之亦能賤之」之神氣、咄咄逼人、甫誕生月餘之政委會當之、諒不能無感於中也、</p>

<h3>科學叢談　中國科學社主編　植樹防空談（上）</h3>
<p>— 李寅恭</p>
<p>比來國際風雲變幻莫測，預言家每每為思患預防之計。卽酷嗜和平之我國，亦濡染時尙，一度從事航空演習。所以示有戒心，亟求自衛，良非獲已。不過處戎旤紛學迫於眉睫之頃，以我國之科學落伍，無領空設備，如高射砲防毒氣面具等，矧云如彼東西各國一般民衆率嫻於工業製造，一旦有事，立將境內千百公私機廠，轉為軍用，水陸戰備有素，防空亦不成問題。摭以對比，寗足與之相競，禦侮圖存之不容坐視，殆無可諱言已。</p>
<p>就防空論，吾國現時飛機有限，大抵只合偵察與驅逐方面之遣用。都會無地道電車，建築少十數級浮圖，城寨所在，未免空虛。槍械之儲，太嫌簡陋，此人人所共稔也。邇年侈談建築，以代建設，新衙署之巍然高聳，望若宮殿者何限，遠近且猶在爭傚，一事之舉辦，動輙用國幣數十以至百萬而未已。其實並少需要，或付之完全不生產之途，非饜少數入養尊處優之慾嗜，卽為誇耀當時逞快人意　耳。至此始憬悟於一朝被炸，有立成灰燼之可能，然已悔之晚矣</p>
<p>請言防空之重要。世界曩日人羣視綫之所集，為物質享用。如法德以藝術馳名，羅馬以建築冠世，錦繡河山，炫赫在人耳目，令人生無涯欽羨心，今則不然。自新戰器之航空學演進，所謂堅甲利兵，且有時陷於不及陳陣，而可以遽吿瓦解，大勢隨去者。在至短時期中，卽不免城郭邱墟，人民塗炭之歎。故輓近科學之促人深省，並驅一般學者頭腦為邃密研討者，率在軍事上之防空術耳。顧可不注意哉。</p>
<p>進就植樹何以能防空述之。　隱蔽建築物，喬林枝葉，高出地表，由數丈可達十餘丈。陰蔭籠罩，卽少數大樹之樹冠，掩護亦能及遠。　蒙混軍事設備，如要塞之砲壘戰壕及共他工事，每為敵機目標，多樹則飛航路錢，或因偵查不易，無形中阻遏其前進。　埋伏行軍，彼不易覺察我之屯軍，我得以抄其捷徑，運用高射砲迎擊之。　隔除延燒。當敵機擲彈森炸之際，彈必先觸樹頂，旣减少其破壞力，復因多數樹種具有防火功能，卽或彈炸燃燒，亦可隔離火路，免其蔓延。　森林中濕度較大，更因落葉枯枝之堆積，其所組成之地被物與夫樹葉樹皮，均有吸收毒氣功用，可使敵機發放之毒氣，早行消滅。此外涉於防禦工事上特點，更僕難終。</p>
<p>吾國古時軍事用林頗多，可以追紀者，如桃林塞（左傳晋侯使詹嘉處瑕以守桃林之塞在長安東四百里）松柏塞（荀子據松柏之塞）楡林塞（漢書韓安國傳樹楡為塞）。他如三國時曹操與馬超戰，若非森林掩蔽，曹操必被擒獲。降至近世，寇匪為患，國軍往剿，每每兩軍對峙，猶有時憑藉山林以抗敵，為太不鮮見。以近代世界史觀之。一九一四年，歐戰開始後，德軍所以未能長驅直壓於法境者，分明為林樹蔽天烽烟為阻之大因也。我國曩者游東西洋之研習海陸軍學者，條陳邊陲設置要塞，惜鮮齒及防軍駐地與夫鄰近區域之造林。洎乎海疆變亂，則砲台一帶地點，輒易為敵船探遠燈所發見，失策曷勝。試觀靑島匯泉山及太平山等之砲壘舊址，前為德人所慘淡經營者，環境何莫非藉刺槐松等樹種廣袤栽植，蔚起絕好林相，蜿蜓曲直，使人茫然失要害之所在。歐戰中日本人圍攻經月而不敢登陸者，其故固顯然昭示來茲矣。</p>
<p>然則為欲達到防空之目的應當如何植樹。請申論之。（一）多選常綠或能避火者為最有效。各地樹種繁夥，匆促間不能一一指數，第如公孫樹，栓皮櫟，苦儲，冬靑，女貞，交讓木，珊瑚樹，水靑岡，柯，槲，櫟，抱，柞，山茶，…等，皆為適當之選。共他凡幹部高聳之闊葉樹類及枝葉內含水分多者亦佳。惟對於枝葉富油脂質及着火易者少用。如係單株獨樹之生長，則不必太苛求。（二）栽植距離不妨略為從密，取共易於鬱閉，且在環境緊逼中，高長量允加發達，亦屬植物生理上自然之趨勢。（三）疏處宜急栽下木，往往遇快長性者，不數年且將追及於上層樹，而樹冠猶且過之。彼枝幹柔軟帶有彈性之樹種，允所需要。因由飛機下擲之彈，觸之或不易爆發，而致轟炸傷人。竹類亦佳，毛竹尤宜。</p>
<p>東西各國政府視林為政費來源之大宗，社會視林為公共事業投資最穩常之所。人民視林為精神寄託所不可須臾離之物。故不論市區鄉野，除露石之地不適營林外，卽磽确土層略帶地被物者，且不忍任共棄置。所以凛地失其利之誡，何嘗專為防空掩護計，不過在遭逢軍事之時，其受森林之賜彌多。如飛機製造木材之取給，橋樑戰壕用木之供應，以至行軍張搭棚厦之一切臨時用途，悉有取之不竭用之不盡之蓄積。樹木之裨益，又豈吾人所能罄述耶。</p>

<p>最先上場者、爲沈聿恭尹貴仁（鋒）、劉寳成（中）、王士選蔡演雄（衛）、雙方打來、均不順手、各有罰球、均無建樹、相持有四五分鐘、海賊蘭英憑身高手長、在籃下拋進一球、接後沈聿恭遠射妙中、劉寳成續獲二分、沈劉叉共得三分、以七比二佔先、海賊投射失去標的、格格不入頗有侷促不安之態、長脚蘭英又在籃下中第二球、沈聿恭繼之罰中一分、成八比四、海賊由白乃特上場調史密斯、中華全批調動、</p>
<p>是節中華全體、根本陷於崩潰、各自爲政、沈聿恭之遠射、手法甚佳、尹貴仁碌碌如常、劉寳成呆木遲鈍、僅一平凡之中鋒、王士選殺辣勇武、蔡演雄活潑可取、兩後衛堪稱滿意、</p>
<h3>第二回十四比十二　中華雖勝形勢甚僵</h3>
<p>十分鐘後、中華人馬全批調動、由王鴻斌、徐兆熊（鋒）、徐亨（中）、孫寳慶、李鶴鼎（衛）、五人接替、徐亨之中鋒、膽量太小、與劉寳成無分軒輊、徐劉之材、陳祥龍實有過之無不及、王徐之表演甚佳、但少建樹、全隊絕無聯絡可言、作戰藝術、一無可取、小徐與沈聿恭之戰法、除手法靈巧之外、並無特殊優點、孫寶慶優於李鶴鼎甚多、是節中海賊聲勢漸壯、白乃特史規亞最爲活動、卡遜巳能盡其職守、努力防衛、中華僅由徐兆熊中兩球、王鴻斌中一球、結果成八比六、總爲十四比十二、上半時結束、中華勝二分、總計上半時、海賊九次罰球、一無所中、</p>
<h3>第三回廿一比廿七　海賊超出作戰劇烈</h3>
<p>下半時起、中華又全批調人、由馮念華、牟作雲（鋒）、徐亨（中）、趙志華、尹煥文（衛）作戰、馮牟二鋒、衝刺甚佳、聯絡可觀、惜徐亨不能盡其中鋒之職、運球傳遞每嫌遲滯、趙志華尹煥文表演尙佳、開始後、小馮兩决在人間腋下、以敏捷之躱避、竄前連中兩球、海賊亦極力攻守、別塞爾史規亞到處活動、與卡遜成爲海賊之中堅分子、史密斯反見碌碌、俄爾二十比十八、海賊超出、馮念華續獲三分、史密斯與卡遜造成一十七比二十一、超前六分、斯時觀衆高呼王玉增出場、情形如同災區難民之呼籲、</p>
<h3>第四回卅一比四七　中華依然不振而敗</h3>
<p>最後十分鐘、由王鴻斌牟作雲二理想中之前鋒上場、仍以劉寳成爲中鋒、劉雲章與王南珍爲後衛、因海賊之猖在、形勢格外激烈、但劉與二鋒不能呼應合拍、王南珍敏銳善戰、忽攻忽守、實爲目前中國第一名後衛、無疵可摘、劉雲章平平無奇、此人之能入選候選之列、誠嘆中國無能人矣、後易以李紹唐、局勢巳成在瀾、收復失地、實無能爲力、兩鋒因中鋒之生硬、殊少建樹、海賊從此得心應手、靑雲直上、以四七比三十一獲勝</p>
<h3>籃球試賽結束後　李震中應否入選</h3>
<p>出席世運會籃球預選、業已結束、經過三次的預賽和三决的試賽、各人的技術如何，選拔委員諸君、諒必已很愼密的胸有成竹了、在最近各報上所看見的批評或擬的陣綫、或對於以後的訓練等等、都言之切當、不可漠視、允其是二十八日某報上發表的陣綫（十四人）據說就是選拔委員某君的授意、我們也很表同情、但我們現在所要說的是國術體專南征籃球隊球員的應吾有入選資格的問題、</p>
<p>國體隊南征的計劃、早發表在全國籃球預選之前、後來要他們中止南征、而參加全國預選、則在他們的學校方面、當然有許多困難、爲這困難而國體不能中止南征、便剝奪他們補選的資格、似乎也不很合法、固然一個球隊、不能影響到整個集團、但因爲整個集團中還不能盡善盡美、國體的球員有可、以來補充而致完璧的人村、這種人材我們是絕對不能仟意放棄的、</p>
<p>現在的候選隊中、最欠缺的是中鋒、老實說劉寳成徐亨資格都還不够、李震中是全國最好的中鋒、能守能攻、他的技術不在王玉增之下、二人同時入選、隊伍一定格外整齊張景實若能嚴格指導督促避免犯規的行爲、實是一員後衛虎將、唐寳堃雖已失去黃金前時代、途無復希望、但以他現在的技術、也不妨充一預備員、當然最要緊的還是李震中、</p>
<p>在這决二十名候選人中、有多人實是免强之至如劉雲章于敬孝、在任何甲等球隊中、不難找出此種人材、以整個的觀察來講、吾國的籃球、並沒有進步、我們希望正式人選决定以後、再的海賊比賽兩塲、然後再合宿訓練、</p>
<p>「代表中國出席柏林世運會、乃爲中華任何靑年所應認爲無上之榮譽、有眞實球藝者、方可入選而無憾、如應入選者而被擯斥、此不但爲對球員之不公平、更爲對整個中華隊之不公平、懐有眞實球藝者、始有穿著中國隊球衣之權利、以參加十一屆世運會也、」這是出席世運會選擇任何隊伍都應注意到的、</p>
<h3>臨去秋波　高麗昨勝中華　二比一勝</h3>
<p>隊之球藝、確屬不差、脚頭之堅硬、奔跑之迅速、傳遞搶奪勇敢善鬥之精神、無可訾議、其敗於華北也、尤爲不幸、昨日下午三時、與上海中華隊友誼賽於申園、果然大顯顏色、自始至終、均優勢、絲毫不懈、允以金成玕之銜刺有勁、奔搶敏捷、鄭龍洙之抵禦有方、克盡職守、爲最出色、上海隊素以技巧勝、但對延禧隊之勇猛、竟無法應付、李義臣仍然行動遲慢、孫錦順失機太多、陳鎭和亦不如昔日之雄猛、下半時調任左翼、更無發展機會、李寗表演較前遜色、惟江善敬頗賣力、救出險球不少、餘子均屬平平、下半時會力圖反攻、但錯誤迭見、致大好機會、均予錯過、設非錦順之十二碼罰進、則昨賽竟吃鴨蛋矣、觀衆的二千餘人、僑滬韓人亦多到場助威、裁判員沈回春、</p>

<h3>十二碼免吃鴨蛋</h3>
<p>再戰後、上海隊志圖雪恥、陣綫大變、賈幼良初露色相、李義臣退守後防、高麗隊不擺在心上、仍然猖獗、未三分鐘、柳熺春沿邊偷進一脚、傳中恰到好處、李寗頭頂未着、惡運遂臨、金成玕如餓虎撲鷹、漁翁得利、砉然一脚、應聲入網、高麗隊以二比零佔先、孫錦順統領諸將、浩浩蕩蕩、引兵深入、誓復失地、鄭龍洙一馬當先、攔阻去路、孫錦順改變方針、遙傳幼良、鄭龍洙恃其驍勇、又來搶奪、不幸手吻皮球、判罰十二碼、孫鐵腿牙關一咬、球低而急、金忠炫不及挽救、球鑽入網、上海隊扳回一城、士氣大振、勇氣倍增、賈幼良帶球直關、轉遞中央、孫錦順腿上無力、斜出界外、顧尙勸捲土重來、與陳鎭和互相呼應、又逼進高麗腹地、洪聖恩阻成角球、此時上海隊進攻極爲激烈、無奈命運不濟、球多過門不入、高麗隊險象旣過、乘機再攻、韓甲錫主罰角球、落點甚佳、張榮才躍起一擊、球出不遠、金成玕故技重施、球未落地、即舉脚猛射、張榮才不及趕回、李義臣暫代其職、一脚踢出、未遭毒手、其勢極險、馮運佑再輸糧草、鐘勇森悔不該客氣讓人、江善敬如飛將軍下降、連忙救駕、賈幼良邊境謀反、運傳中央、孫錦順被李裕瀅監視太嚴、無用武之地、丁海敦不顧利害、以手代脚、許竟成踢罰任意、球正落門前、孫錦順從人叢中奔出一踢、球急而有力、不料金忠炫早有準備、兩手抱住、功虧　簣、此後彼來我往、均無建樹、時間吿終、二比一高麗隊高唱凱歌、</p>

<h3>兒童敎育小說　小男兒（一六四）</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄譯　Louisa　M．Alcott原著</p>
<p>有一天他經過白楊林的時候，他看見幾個童子，正在爬上樹去，利用細長椏枝的彈力，再蕩下來，以爲笑樂。唐恩停留一下看看他們的游戲，却並未參加進去，當他立着時已輪到了解客。不幸解客揀的一株過於粗大；因爲當他蕩開去的時候，這抹樹只梢梢彎下一些、使得他高高懸空掛着，殊屬危險。</p>
<p>「回過去罷；你是辦不到的」！內罷從下面喊着。</p>
<p>解客也試回去，然而那些椏枝從他手裏滑去，他沒法用他的腿去纏住那樹幹。他踢着，他拖着，他試抓着，然而終於不濟事，最後他已絕望，祇是懸掛在空中，連氣也喘不過來，可憐地喊道：</p>
<p>「接住我！救救我！我只有跌下來了！」</p>
<p>「那是你要跌死的」，內達嚇得魂不附體。</p>
<p>「莫放手」唐恩喊道；他於是跑上樹去，好容易從樹葉叢裏打出一條路，直到他幾乎到了解客的身旁，解客的臉儘向他看，充滿了怕懼和希望。</p>
<p>「你們兩人都要下來了，」內達在底下的斜坡子上跳着，興奮得很，乃應伸出他的兩臂，好像是要去接住他們的模樣。</p>
<p>「這正是我們所要的，底下的人快避開」，唐恩鎭靜地說着，當他說的時候，他所增加的重量，使這樹更加垂下，近地數尺。</p>

<h3>紗花　美棉發現破綻　紗花頹勢難挽　金雞與三品各跌二元許　標花亦有八九角之跌面</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風劇烈、良以海外棉業一致慘落、人心大受打擊、賣風略熾、同時現紗需要亦無生氣、市象愈見衰弱、惟達記扒補尤鉅、然仍難遏制疲頹之勢也、</p>
<p>標紗斬多與加空並起</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因海外棉市不振、各月一致開拍低盤、局勢益覺軟化、大阪三品紗猛跌二元外、同時現紗銷路依然寂寞、浮多了結、市價愈見鬆解、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元至一元二·三·四角、午後開盤、市况仍屬暗淡無神、因海外消息不佳、長豐多頭大批斬結、裕大空頭加碼、惟達記抵補甚多、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二·五·六·九角、査賣出合興一千六百五十包、大豐五百五十包、元一六百包、潤康一千六百五十包、信誠一千零五十包、裕大一千五百五十包、益昶九百五十包、長豐二千零五十包、買進大孚八百五十包、同和四百包、通記五百五十包、達記二千一百五十包、錦昌一千零五十包、義成八百包、長豐七百五十包、大昶一千七百五十包、合興六百包、愼記一千五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>現紗銷路仍淸、査全日各幫賣去、統計五百十五包、行情跌五角至一元、各幫買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市因美棉政府對於三月期大量囤積之計畫、未有决定之表示、市價發現破綻而跌、印棉趨勢不佳、且跌風愈銳、於是人心驚惶賣風濃密、金業幫多頭紛紛出籠、市價乃步步下瀉矣、</p>
<p>標花金業幫多頭斬結</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉跌五至二十九磅音、印棉跌〇二五至二羅比半、四·五·月期白洛區重復打破二百羅比關口、前途情形仍屬看跌、大阪三品棉花跌七·八角至一元、於是市場人心振震、賣風大熾、各月直綫下瀉、惟達記大量購進、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二角半至三·四·五角、午後開盤、因標金在低價收盤、金業幫多頭大批斬結、以致檯面愈形鬆濫、市盤更難支持、結果各月比上午收盤價又跌三角半至四角、査賣出吉豐一千五百担、裕大五千一百担、廣豐七千三百担、同豐二千四百担、長豐一千七百担、潤康五千四百担、益康一千八百担、通記一千担、合興二千七百担、長和八千八百担、買進愼記二千四百担、源大一千一百担、達記一萬一千七百担、合興三千担、森康三千一百担、元一四千七百担、長和二千一百担、明德一千七百担、昶記二千担、大昶二千七百担、源興昌二千五百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、市况不定、各月漲跌五磅音、同業恐一角二分借欵之棉出籠、售出陳棉、買進新棉、惟此項計劃尚未確定、場中多頭了結、新買缺乏、至趨勢不振、旋以人心恐政府拋售之額、超越七月期所能吸收、紛紛拋售、市價銳落、最後一部份空戶抵補、略見回風、海斯德氏估計本週廠用為三三〇、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底為三八九、〇〇〇包、計現貨跌二十五磅音、期貨跌五至二十九磅音、英棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌二點、印棉期貨商賣出及大批多頭了結、但為歐洲出口商及日商買進所吸收、計平果爾漲跌〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣跌一·七五至二羅比、白羅溪跌二·五羅比、原電錄左、（三十一日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、一日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為一百九十六較比、較上日收盤跌一·七五羅比、</p>

<p>本埠白包花驟减　一月三十一日调査惟洋架子增加</p>
<h3>紗交增收本月花特證　七月期棉花交割等級未有更動</h3>
<p>本市紗布交易所茲於一月十八日召集棉花鑑定會議、以供二十五年七月期交割之用、審査結果、全部與六月期等級相同、絕無更改、棉紗自本年起改訂兩個月一檢査、七月期標紗無審査等級、在六月期中一倂鑑定訂好云、</p>
<p>二月份標花自一號起對於新買賣一律增收特別證金每担三元、兩存賬收取一方云、</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉廠商略有套出　各月形勢步步見鬆</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤、各月份大致轉鬆疲之態、洋麥報價、芝加哥好八分至一角零、坎拿大好二角左右、市塲人心、因前日回升太驟、未免觀望、且謠傳有洋麥成交、致人心甚平、各月份開價均小去一二分左右、迨至下午開盤、以業外多頭步有脫手、廠方亦微有套出、故形勢步步見鬆、不過存底終覺不豐、後步如無特殊變動、仍看平定之象、至七月份新粉、亦已循例開拍、初價二元九角半、收盤為二元九角六分七厘半、計好一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期現麥交易兩寂</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤、各月份交易未見暢旺、市面因外行不動、亦轉停寂、各月份小分一二分、迨至下午開盤、交易仍然不暢、惟粉市轉軟、價又略鬆、七月份標凖新麥、開價四元三角半、交易尚暢、價少出入、此後因距新收尚遠、變化當甚巨耳、現麥市面、價見穩定、存底不豐、交易甚少、祗開山東　灣麥五百包、價五元一角半、由福阜兩家辦去云、</p>
<h3>米市紅盤銷路尚稱健旺　到貨雖湧各漲一二三四角不等</h3>
<p>（滬南）滬南米源、自客歲休市迄今、共到一百六十餘號、（貨共三萬二千餘石、）昨紅盤銷場、零躉胃口、均稱健旺、計本街方面共去七八千石、津威靑烟等幫採取厚粳三千餘包、薄稻八千餘包、故結果紅盤開出能較去年見升、計厚早粳價高二三角、薄稻三四角、而杜洋尖及陰變元悉有二三尺之秀色、</p>
<p>（滬北）前昨兩日內地各路來源、及河積頗厚、共約二百號左右、市上各貨銷路雖皆應酬交易、而去化尚稱不惡、致市價較去歲收盤白粳加起一二角、早稻加起二三角、薄稻津胃動辦零消亦可、價加緊三角、白元定勢、陰元緊扣近角、羊埠尖挺立、客尖緊起一二角、其餘各貨亦加昂近角、</p>
<h3>秈米續有客囤貪辦　各地均有途貨可到</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭漸有長江各埠裝到、江西湘漢沙市以及浙江各屬均有裝出在途、因滬市報漲、各方都聞讀運出、滬上存底本充、到頭一旺、人心不免轉軟、然以本客囤胃均貪、市氣依然挺立、昨日本街最活、囤戶亦有贛米問津、廈門幫則有贛江米廣東紅秞等三百六十包裝出、天津去暹羅米彔六百包、本街與囤戶去贛米　萬包、溫台三千一百十包、湘米五百三十七包、安慶杭州等三百多包、行情大部與前市相似、但中關貨為本客歡迎者略形微俏云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤、如二四粗砂白以及東赤白等、市價均乏上落、號貨有建幫開出什路白一批、較高者為十九元二角、以次自十五元八角至五六角、赤糖十二元半、共計成交四百餘包、比前白糖無甚上落、惟赤糖降去四五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金針菜漲風大熾</h3>
<p>金針菜、自紅盤開後、以存底單薄、漲風大熾、粵閩兩幫以及溫台等處、銷胃亦動、連日共計辦去四百餘包、價自二十六元至二十四元、均屬賤、昨號盤頂裝開至三十元、以次略减、比漲六七元、徐州菜客貨、竟叫三十三元、鎭幫均觀望、不肯多售、故僅成交百數包、同時鎭江產區長途電話云、亦升五六元、以二十八元開售百餘包、後未肯續兌、據同業人目中、有看四十元之說、即或一時難達、但三十五六元、恐不久當可實現云、黑瓜子存底亦薄、前後雖已提漲、但仍在續漲中、昨提莊子以十九元半開出一百包、明光子開十六元、成交二百二十四包、前後均升一元、又叢記徐魁子開至十九元、後市至少尚須升一二元、人心極為穩固、</p>
<h3>絲茶　抽芯珍眉銷路略動</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市，自總結束以來、停滯已閱多日、近日摩洛哥春銷略見發動、各洋行對於去年購進之貨、頗多裝運出口、其中抽芯珍眉綠茶、恊和永興等行亦多乘賤補進、昨由洪源永公升永永興隆等茶棧、售出屯溪歙縣等路抽芯貨三百餘箱、惟售價縮至八十四五元、較去年又跌五六元至八元不等云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　駱駝絨市價無甚變化</h3>
<p>毛貨呢羢、紅盤交易多已開出、惟因銀根不鬆、故交易較往年為稀、而貿易反較往年順利、此蓋業中人皆知到本昂貴故也、老貨開價較舊臘略貴二三角、套頭貨因漲價太多、故猶未動、寬緊條子、素色美術各種駱駝羢、新歲紅盤開價、依然不變、緯綸老虎圖仍售二元一角、天翔仙鶴圖一元九角半、維一雙鹿圖一元四角半、大得鳳凰圖一元三角、光華銀象圖九角半、呢羢綢緞洋貨門市部俱有成交、趨勢甚形繁盛云、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條實銷不起</h3>
<p>四十尺長竹節鋼條、近來交易、又呈冷落、蓋紅盤提加十餘元、每噸需一百三十元、故建築幫胃口頓呆、而客幫生意、又以銀錢業放欵緊縮、故多觀望不辦、是以市象十分閑散、雖業此者竭力設法推銷、但環境惡劣、終覺不易、査前昨以來、市場中祗開出七八十噸、其行情為一百二十四五元、比紅盤便宜四五元光景、聞大批買賣、則行情尚可低廉也、</p>
<h3>紫銅開出二百担</h3>
<p>花旗紫銅、昨日由銅皮廠購去二百担、價每担五十元、比紅盤小二元、査此貨交易、自兵工廠停辦以後、市情久寂、而客幫走銷亦寡、是以市勢頗為蕭條、今銅皮廠已見採辦、來市或有轉機之望也、</p>
<h3>雜訊　海口樹膠紅盤漲四分</h3>
<p>海口樹膠（即橡皮套鞋之原料）邇來以到貨稀少、時見緊俏、査前日僅到二十五件、昨紅盤已如數開通、價為每市磅五角一分、比升四分、據貨客函訊、後貨須四五月底方可再裝、其貨底之薄、於此可見、新加坡貨品質較佳而色白、高貨須五角六分、普通五角三分、亦因軋缺頗俏、後防再升、</p>

<h3>我將來做怎樣的人</h3>
<p>— 武昌第十一小學六年生連文湘</p>
<p>人們的志趣，須隨環境而定，不能順應環境的人，必爲社會所屛棄，這是我輩靑年學生所宜注意的。那麼我將來做個怎樣的人呢？</p>
<p>在這國難嚴重時期，荷槍實彈，拚一死以衛國，「凱旋作國士，戰死爲國殤。」做個爲國犧牲的烈士好嗎？我認爲這種捍衛國家的責任，自有愛國的男子負擔，用不着我們女子越俎的</p>
<p>當强鄰壓境，抗戰劇烈的時候，男子馳騁疆塲，女子料理家事，做那防守後方的工作好嗎？我覺得這些事件，稍有知識的人都會做，我可不願意做了。</p>
<p>我的志願，是要做戰塲上的天使——奈丁格爾。現在的中國，正如螳螂失勢，被困於羣蟻，而唯一的出路，就只有抗戰，一旦戰爭開始，我愛國志士，受砲彈的轟炸，斷手斷足，呻吟血泊中，求生不得，求死不能，該是多麼慘痛！雖有後方醫院，亦恐緩不濟急；措置稍有遲緩，損失不可數計。我將集合多數同志，專任前方看護。用我們的撫慰，解除他們的苦悶；用我們的同情，减輕他們的創痛。使傷者得以早痊，軍心得着安慰，不是一舉兩得嗎？</p>
<p>效呂四娘之殺敵，我非無心，所苦無人敎我鍊劍，效花木蘭之平寇，我實有意，所苦政府不徵女兵。至於不出繡樓的閨秀，擅長詩文的才女，則非環境所宜，亦非現時所需，究非我所願做的了。我所願做的，只是順應環境的，有裨國家的，而且是力所能及的戰塲上的天使。</p>
<h3>作者近影</h3>
<h3>一個成功的人</h3>
<p>— 許瘦鶴</p>
<p>小朋友們：在歷史上許多著名的發明家當中，如愛迪生之發明電燈，瓦特的發明蒸汽機……大的你們都是很知道的了。現在，我們再來談一個對於我們也是很有帮助的發明家。</p>
<p>這人名呌谷騰堡，他是一個德國人，起先他是做磨寶石製眼鏡的手藝的，開了一個眼鏡舖子，後來因爲生意折本，就將舖子收歇，開了一座印書店，就像我們，現在呌做印刷所的差不多。</p>
<p>有一决，他替人家印一部書，耍刻上許許多多的版子，因爲那時候活字版還沒有發明，印一張書，就得要刻上一塊木版，印一本一百多頁的書，就要刻上一百多塊版，並且，祇印這種書可用，如印別種樣子的書，又非得再另刻一種版子不可。他想：這樣多够麻煩，而且，也太不經濟；便用他的腦筋，仔細思索，結果，給他發明了一種東西，印　書來，眞是又快又便利，這是茶麼呢？原來，就是我們現在所呌做的活字版。</p>
<p>造這活字版的方法，是先用銅或其他東西做成字的模子，然後把火熔化了的鉛，灌到模子裏去，等到冷了，再把鉛倒出來，就成了一個個的鉛字。用這方法，可以造出好些不同樣的字來，然後照着稿子，依着决序，排到版上，便可以印書了。印完之後，魷把鉛字一個個的拆下來收着，如若再印別種書，又可以重新排好去印。這樣一來，就省掉每决刻版的功夫，並且，如將排好的版子，裝在機器上面，那麼，幾萬字的書報，祇要幾個鐘頭，便都可以印出來了。</p>
<p>後來大家都照他的樣子仿效，眞是便利萬分，所以到他死了之後，他們本鄉的人，還替他立了一塊碑，紀念他哩。</p>
<h3>國旗</h3>
<p>— 劉永淸</p>
<p>何等光榮而雄壯的國旗啊！受了微風的吹拂，向空飛舞，我看了它，頓然熱血沸騰，精神奮發。</p>
<p>『可敬可愛的國旗啊！你是國家魂魄的寄託，你是國民精神的代表。你對於我們，負着重大的責任，顫巍巍地矗立在我們中國。你替我們宣言於世界道：「這裘是中國的土地，有誰破壞和平，侵犯主權的，我就和他拚命！」』</p>
<p>中華的國民啊！我們要怎樣的圖自强，纔對得起它的熱心。</p>
<h3>太陽</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在天氣嚴冷的時侯，大家都喜歡這隻經濟的火爐－太陽，在敏兒的家裹，不因沒錢而不生火爐，實爲火爐於我們只有害處有沒有益處，而陽光却於我們有莫大的利益，所以敏兒家裹對於陽光是最歡迎的了。</p>
<p>一天，敏兒和聰兒在陽光中取暖，敏兒的身上都晒得在發熱，便覺得這隻大火爐是很奇怪的，便開口問他的哥哥：</p>
<p>『哥哥，太陽裏面到底是什麼東西。去我們地球有多少遠？」</p>
<p>『在十九世紀以前（一千八百多年）人類無從知道太陽的成分。後來經了好多的天文學家苦心研究，才發明了一種景析學（是由各氣體所發的光，可以推知其爲何種物質。）用了這種方法，去檢查太陽所發出來的光，便知道它和地球的成分一半是相同，什麼輕氣哪，氧哪一，碳，錫，銀，銅，鐵，鉛等都有，不過氮，氣，磷，太陽是沒有的。要知道太陽去地球多少遠，只要看月球去地球多少遠。月球離開我們地球總算是很近的了，那知它相去竟有二十四萬英里之遠，人類還沒有法子到它上面去探險。太陽去地球更遠了，說出來你要一嚇，恐怕這個數目，你也寫不出，有多少呢？有九千二百九十萬英里，比月球和地球的距離大三百四十五倍。再來舉一個有趣的譬喻，更可驚了。假使有一個長跑家在每秒鐘中能跑十碼，脚一直不停的跑，那麼他一年能跑地球七圈。假使他要跑到太陽裏去，便要五百年才可跑到，再從太陽回到地球，又要五百年，一共要一千年，可驚不可驚？這不過是理想罷了。那裹有這長壽的人類？』</p>
<p>『旣是這樣的遠，那麼太陽裹的熱傳到地球上，不是要冷了嗎？爲什麼我們都覺得是熱的？』</p>
<p>『太陽的溫度極高，幾乎不能測量，它表面的溫度巳經是在攝氏寒暑表上六千度到七千度之間。它裏面的溫度就不可設想了。最近人類所能造的溫度，不過是在攝氏寒暑表上三千八百度，只及太陽表面溫度的一半，地球比太陽小一百萬倍，所以太陽對於地球不過是空中的一點灰塵，它旣有這樣高的溫度，傳到地球上怎會冷呢？』</p>
<p>敏兒聽了這許多話，便覺得天空的偉大了。</p>
<h3>簡便的毽子</h3>
<p>— 怡廬</p>
<p>嚴寒的冬天！毽子是很時髦的玩物，本來，毽子對於小朋友們，是極有益處的，也可以說是小朋友們的高尙娛樂。在冷的時候，踢着毽子跑跑跳跳的，不但立時可以暖和，而且對於身體，也有很大的利益。</p>
<p>毽子的製法是用一寸長的鵝毛管子，和一個銅錢，把鵝毛管子的一端剪岔了，連着銅錢，用布包裹起來，再拿針綫縫好，另外找幾根雄鷄尾巴上的彩色錦鷄毛，挿在鵝毛管裹，就成爲一個毽子了！不過雄鷄的鷄毛，和鵝毛管都不很容易找，所以性急的小朋友們，最好來做個紙毽子，紙毽子的製法，非常的簡便，魷是先用一張長方形的白紙，——當然紅紙；綠紙；以及彩色紙；那是更好了。把它順長折疊起來，再用剪子把折的兩邊，剪成一條條的細絲，上面留着七八分不剪。剪好以後，再放開來橫折，折成四方的，在中間放一個銅元，就用紙將銅元包好，外面用綫紮上幾道，這紙毽子就成功了！小朋友們，何妨試試看。</p>
<p>毽子的踢法，是很多的。有正踢；有反踢；有兩脚互換着踢；有踢到背上的；有踢到的臉上的；更有踢到鼻子上的；那名目有歪頭；有頂頭；有脚頭；有抱過河；眞是五花八門，會踢的不但能够接連踢上幾百幾千；而且踢的花樣也特別的多，眞是非常有趣。不過這也是天天練習的，在初踢的時候，是踢不多，踢不好的，所以才學踢毽子的小朋友們，不要性急，慢慢的自然能够踢得多；踢得好了！</p>
<h3>一九三五年</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>——小遊戲之一——</p>
<p>一九三五年剛剛過去，一九三六年接着就來了。小朋友，對於過去道一年，大家總還有點依依不捨罷。</p>
<p>不捨儘管不捨，時光老人到底把它帶走了。</p>
<p>現在，爲紀念道一個年份起見，我們來舉行一次算術遊戲罷。</p>
<p>小朋友，上面不是有九個阿拉伯字母麼？從O到S爲止。下面不是有一個加法算式麼？它的答數是1935。我們要把上面九個阿拉伯數目字，一個一個地放在那九條虛綫上，要使它們加起來，答數恰巧是1935</p>
<p>小朋友，大家請來試一試罷，這是一個有趣的遊戲呢。</p>
<p>萬一試不出，或者答數不對，那末請看下一期的本刊，那上面有正確的答案。</p>
<h3>「哈哈哈哈哈……」</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>——小遊戲之二——</p>
<p>小朋友，有許多小事情，我們一定以爲辦得到的，可是試試看，却無論如何辦不到，這不是很奇怪麼？</p>
<p>今天，我把一張紙頭，像上圖那樣撕開，叫我的小弟弟用兩手分握着兩邊，問他道：</p>
<p>『我要你把兩邊都撕下來，辦得到麼？」</p>
<p>小弟弟毫不思想，便回答道：「這有什麼！你瞧。」他一面說，一面兩手用力向兩邊撕，——只聽見「嘶……」一聲，却只有右手那一邊的紙條撕下來了，（如下圖），左手那一邊的一點也沒有撕碎。</p>
<p>『咦！咦……』小弟弟禁不住奇怪起來了。</p>
<p>這一件有趣的小遊戲，引動了許多人來觀看了：外婆，舅母，大弟弟，表姊，都嘻着嘴看着。他們都要求我給他們試試，我照上圖的樣式撕了許多紙頭，讓他們一個個試過來。</p>
<p>他們在未試以前，每個人的臉上都現出「我一定用力撕，兩邊都撕下來」的神氣，可是結果呢，這個人是半斤，那個人是八兩——誰都只能撕下一邊。於是，試的人笑了，看的人也笑了：</p>
<p>『哈哈哈哈哈……』</p>
<p>讀報的小朋友，看了我這篇東西，何妨也去試試，而且叫你的外婆，舅母……試試，使屋裹充滿了笑聲呢。</p>

<h3>招待貧苦兒童的提議</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>各國的基督敎裏，每年到了耶穌誕日，若干敎會，總是舉行一個對於貧苦兒童的集會。這些敎會，在二三果期之前，已着手向各敎友集欵。捐助得多的，果然是好，就是捐助一角，或幾分，也是好的。甚而至於有把玩具糖果等，捐贈的。到了耶誕日，各敎會便把收得的捐欵和物品彙集着，招待一切貧苦的兒童。在這招待會中，有音樂，有電影，有演講，有戲劇，有一切貧苦兒童，平日所沒有機會參與的高尙的娛樂。同時，還有可口的茶點。若是捐欵充分的話，還可每人得到一餐豐盛的晚餐。待到散會時，每人還可得一袋玩具或糖果。</p>
<p>這些年來，上海各敎會，也有此舉，雖然他們所舉辦的，未免多少是含有宗敎氣味的，但是我以爲基督的「博愛」「自由」「平等」「互助」等精神，我輩小朋友們，也是不可少的。因此，我現在特向小朋友們提議，集各個小朋友的財力，也來自動的舉行一下。自然，這麼的偶然舉行一决，是絕對無補於貧苦兒童的實際生活的，但是在他們的貧苦生活中，給與他們這麼一天的娛樂，總比了沒有的强。因爲這種集會，一方面有指示他們正當娛樂方法之功，一方還可引誘他們努力工作，以謀生活改進的希望。若干世界上有名的偉大人物，都是出身貧賤的，所以貧苦兒童，只須知道努力上進，便不難成爲將來的好國民的。而同時呢，在這種招待會上，小朋友們和貧苦兒童，有着密接的接觸，也可以領悟着不少貧苦兒童的貧苦生活的內面。</p>
<p>因此我現在想請各小朋友們，立卽各提出儲蓄的一部分來，集成巨欵，招待近旁的貧苦兒童們，盡情地樂一天。那日子，不一定是要耶誕日，或是星期日也行。在集會時，自然大家得毫無拘束地吃着，喝着，笑着，玩着。各人，自然還得帶幾件玩具到會，以便散會時，分贈給貧苦兒童。最好，我想小朋友們，不妨各帶幾伴舊棉襖，棉袴，帽子，手套等等，分膾給貧苦兒童，那是在實際上，很有意義的。</p>

<h3>義狗傳（五）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>柏德希雖是一頭狗，却也知道感激。柏德希若有所思的躺在那裹，張着它那壯嚴溫柔的棕色眼睛，瞧着它兩位好友的一切行動。</p>
<p>可是老達土畢竟太老了，他不能做甚麼繁重的事情以維持他的生活，只能蹣跚地推着一輛小木車，天天給養牛的鄰人們運送牛乳到盎凡爾村中去。</p>
<p>鄰人們雇用他做這小小的工作一小半也是可憐見他，而一大半是爲他勤懇忠實，送牛乳是再配沒有了，到得他送罷了牛乳回來時，又託他看顧花園，田塲和他們的牛羣，雞隻。但是這些工作，在老達士也覺得是很勞苦的了。因爲他老人家年已八十三歲，而盎凡爾也遠在三四英里以外。</p>
<p>柏德希第一天復原時，在頭頸裹套着一個小菊花的花圈安閒地躺在和暖的陽光之下，眼瞧着那些運來運去的牛乳罐子。</p>
<p>第二天早上，老達士還沒有動他的小車兒，柏德希却先就起身走過去，將它的身子放在兩個車柄的中間，表示它自願工作，以報答他們的恩惠。老達士非常的不願意，他以爲硬要狗類做它們不配做的工作，是一件恥辱的事。</p>
<p>但是柏德希不肯接受他老人家的好意；當下見他們並不將它駕在車上，它就想用牙齒拖着車兒向前跑。</p>
<p>末後老達士便屈服了，他被柏德希的一片至誠所戚動。他把那車兒的兩個柄改裝了一下，好使柏德希不用力的在中間帶着跑，從此以後每天的早上，它就很高興的做這工作。</p>
<p>到得冬季來時，老達士很感謝自己的幸運，得以在那羅凡地方的溝渠中撞見這一頭病狗，搭救了回來；因爲他是很老了，身體一年一年的衰弱下來，倘沒有柏德希天天給他拖着那許多牛乳罐兒在雪地泥地中奔跑，他正不知道怎麼對付得了呢。</p>

<h3>各國的石炭軋司林工業</h3>
<p>— 德培</p>
<p>隨着戰爭危機的日益發展，世界各國的軍需工業和公共事業所需的原料也在日益增加。因此，世界各國對於原料的計劃特別注意，如最近德國的人造樹膠工塲建設計劃之逐漸具體化，便是顯明的例證。不過，在這中間，最使人注目的是石炭液化油工業之發展；由此便出現了德英等國的努力於軋司林（Gasoline）的自給自足的現象。</p>
<p>所謂軋司林者，乃是由石炭液化的揮發油之一種，是用於發動機的重耍燃料。現在採取軋司林的最新方法是二十年前德國伯爾古斯博士發明的。目前德國伊格染料公司的工塲，卽用此新法製造了年產十萬噸的液化軋司林，以供給汽車的燃料。前年十月德國又以資本一億馬克設立「褐炭軋司林公司」，每年可生產二十五萬噸的液化軋司林。</p>
<p>本來美國每年要生產百六七十億加倫的軋司林，但其三分之一都是由普通的克拉克法（“Krack　Process”）製造成的。用這個普通製法，只可從原油採取百分之五十的純軋司林。反之，用伯爾古斯法卽可從原油取出百分之百的軋司林。因此，從一九三○年以來，美國漸决廢除克拉克法而採用伯爾古斯新法以製造軋司林了。</p>
<p>石油資源之豐富可以和美國相比的，只有英國，但是，英國的開始從石炭生產液化原料，乃是在一九二九年的時候；而其將此事作爲一種新興工業來發展，引起了世界的注意的，更是去年四月以來的事情。在去年四月，英國最大的帝國化學工業公司在比林加姆（Billingham）建設了液化油製造大工塲，其結果將給與石油業界以一個重大的革命。至於這個比林加姆工塲的製造法，則是以伯爾古斯博士的方法爲基礎，並依據英國石炭的特質，經過多年的實騐，而將其加了若干修正的。</p>
<p>英國的帝國化學工業公司在此林加姆新設的液化法工塲，至少要三百萬鎊的建設費。這個工塲的作業分兩部份：其一是從石炭直接製造軋司林；另一則是因帝國化學工業公司與「低溫炭化公司」訂立協定，由其供給多量的Grooste油和柏油，再於其中取出軋司林。由此直接間接兩方面液化軋司林，比林加姆工塲每年要消費的五十萬噸的石炭。爲了這個石炭的產出，每年需要一千九百五十名鑛工，其液化工塲也有一千名勞動者，合計共有將近三千的人數。這個工塲所生產的液化軋司林，都是經過英美石油公司，英吉利石油公司和Shcll　mex公司等在市塲上出賣的。</p>
<p>此林加姆工塲每年可生產四千五百萬加倫的軋司林，除此之外，原來英國的國產軋司林公司和各種工業作爲副產物所製造出來的軋司林，也有四千五百萬乃至五千萬加倫之多，所以英國在實際上每年要產出九千萬乃至一億加倫的軋司林。</p>
<p>英國的液化軋司林的生產費究竟是多少，很難得到正確的數目字。據一般的傳說和推測，其最低的生產費大概是每加倫七便土。若果如此，則英國國產液化油的販賣價值便是每加倫值一先令　下。與此相較，英國各地的軋司林商店的外油價值現在是每加倫值一先令半。在這樣的競爭情形之下，英國企圖製造液化軋司林者將有繼續出現的可能，已有的如比林加姆工塲等當然也有可能發展，於是英國的國產軋司林之能供給其全需要之大部分也許是要成爲現實的。但這也只是「也許」而已，並不就是必然的事情。因爲耍製造軋司林，如不建設大規校的工塲，與其生產費必不能低廉，而大規模的工塲之建設又必須要有很大的資本，但在目前英國的情况下，要用很大的資本來建設製造軋司林的大工塲，却很困難。同時，軋司林的生產費和石油市價有着很大的關係，但將來世界的石油市價是難於預料的。</p>
<p>當比林加姆工塲完成時，英國軍部從戰略的見地對於牠期望甚深。他們是想萬一有事的時侯，就可不靠輸入軋司林而可從豐富的國產石炭得到必要的燃料。現在英國空軍所使用的軋司林每年是六百五十萬加倫，去年又决定空軍大擴張計劃，想來其今後所需要的軋司林還要大量的增加。這樣，在擴張軍備，準備戰爭的需要下，今後的英國軋司林工業的發展前途當然還是有的；不過牠是否能實現自給自足的理想却還是一個問題。</p>
<p>上面巳經說過，德國是石炭液化油工業的先驅者。在百年以前，德國已經由幼稚的技術，由低溫炭化法有效地處理了使用價值很少的褐炭。其後又繼續研究，更在二十年前出現了成爲現在各國所行的石炭液化法的基礎的伯爾古斯博士的新法。但是，德國的石炭液化工業之進展却是較遲的。原因是：德國所依靠的原料主要的是褐炭，其液化工業的生產費也很高</p>
<p>據調查，近年來英德日三國的石油輸入價額如下：</p>
<p>在這個統計中，我們可以看出德國每年需要巨額的石油。國產石油這樣的缺乏，在國防上當然是最不利的。德國政府雖會以巨額的補助金獎勵開採石油，但貧弱的國內油田終　沒有石油自主獨立的希望。所以目前德國的唯一道路只有努力於石炭液化。</p>
<p>前年十月德國政府會以資本一億馬克設立褐炭軋司林公司，進行大規模地從豐富的國產褐炭採取石油的計劃。最近該公司正擬建設一個大工爲，這個事業完成後，便可從褐炭中取出年產二十萬噸的汽車用的軋司林。同時，已有的工廠也都正在擴張，舉國都熱中於石油自給自足中。</p>
<p>啟事　證誼·守和·程·濮漁·石·曉天·旭晴·達·似若·諸君公鑒，一月份承惠賜大作，曷勝感紉！稿費業巳結算淸楚，請於每月六日至十日，十六日至二十日（星期日除外），每日下午二時至四時，具條蓋章，向本館會計處領取爲荷。（申報業餘周刋編輯部啟）</p>
<p>還有，德國的雷那工塲，現在每年雖只可生產十萬噸的液化軋司林，但牠正在計劃每年能生產三十五萬噸。褐炭軋司林公司的出資者也在計劃每年能增產至百二十五萬噸。如果這個成爲現實，那德國的石油自給自足也魷不會是夢幻了。但現在的生產費還是很高，將來如能從石炭液化，則因其副產物之高價賣出，也許這個生產費還有便宜的可能呢。</p>
<p>此外，如比利時，法國，西班牙等國最近也很努力於石炭液化工業，向　都有顯著的成績。自然，嚴格說來，有炭液化油工業日前還未脫離幼稚的？　，但由於各國的傾全力的注意，　最近的將來必然要顯出驚人的進步的：　是在軍事的需要上，各國政府必要　　計劃發展石炭液化工業。這樣，我們　不難想到，所謂石油資源的　　戰，激烈的石油液化競爭，卽要普　地人大開展。如最近英意乃至美國之爭奪阿比西尼亞的石油資源戰，便是一個現實的明證。</p>

<h3>綠星飛舞中萬人參觀世界語展覽會</h3>
<p>— 艾菲葉女士</p>
<p>在新年裏，眼前的事物都起了劇烈的變動，連自己的心理狀態也彷彿發生了特殊的變化；自己明明是又老了一年，可是，不知怎的，在這幾天裹精神却反比平日更來得興奮些，好像覺得自己比以前更年靑了：頭髮燙得波紋似的，臉上還搽上雪花膏和胭脂，人，像走馬燈般地只是亂轉。瓜子殼，橋子皮，紙烟灰，散滿了一室。太太小姐，花花公子，此往彼來。酒色肉香，牌九麻將，都各各擺起迷魂陣來，把自己團團的圍住，給自己以一種最强烈的麻醉。倒霉的却是書桌上的一排世界語書籍，牠們這幾天是暫時宣吿賦閒了，都歪歪斜斜的躱在屋角裏打瞌睡，也許是正在夢着柴門霍夫呢！</p>
<p>說是「興奮」，其實還不是自己精神上的一種無意識的反動？還不是「頹廢」的一個代名詞？不錯，自己的心明明和玻璃一樣的淸，國家事總逃不出我的眼底，天下事我或許比別人認識得更淸楚點，可是，有的時候，不知從什麼地方吹來了一陣罡風，居然也會把我的心蒙上了一片雲翳，一層塵埃。只有世界語，牠却常時會悄消地爬入我的心坎，高擎着實用主義的旗幟，將這雲翳和塵埃一古腦兒拂去了。</p>
<p>自己已經是一個三十歲以外的女人了，是一個失去了靑春，缺乏奮鬥的勇氣的女人了，是一個寂寞之國裏最最寂寞的女人了。人們漸漸的離棄了我，許多生氣勃勃的靑年忘掉了我，全世界關起門來拒絕我，眼前幾乎沒有一個親熱的人，背後彷彿盡是敵人。只有世界語，牠還不時的熱烈地吻着我，鼓舞我；當失望的黑影從我面前掠過時，牠却從綠色的星羣中撒下了無數美麗的花朶，從現實天國中給我帶來了一些　人的消息。只有世界語，纔是永遠值得人們留戀的「大情人」，也只有在接觸世界語，實用世界語中，你纔能認識眞的眞理，你纔能在這中間找到千百萬活生生的上帝而使你與他們同在。</p>
<p>於是，就在新年的第四日，我終於帶着叉似「興奮」又似「頹廢」的精神，懷着又似「百忙」又似「無聊」的心情，往卡德路永平坊中國世界語書店去瞻仰世界語的全般的面貌了。</p>
<p>這一次－第三决－世界語展覽會的會塲計有兩處，各佔一室，第一會塲在該書店的樓下，第二會塲則在二樓。當我進去時，兩會塲都擠滿了人，據說兩日來參觀的人不下四五千之多。塲中滿佈着巨幅的標語：有用中文書寫的，也有用世界語的，而中文的又可分爲漢字的和新文字的兩種。茲將該項標語分別摘錄一二條如下，俾讀者得略見其一斑（其用世界語及新文字書寫的，作者爲使本文便於排印起見，概把牠們譯成漢字）：</p>
<p>用世界語書寫的——一用世界語來解放中國」</p>
<p>用新文字書寫的——「世界語是使得中國人能够參加國際文化的工具」</p>
<p>用漢字書寫的——「爲千萬人而說話，應該用普遍的言語「世界語」，我的著作被譯成世界語，才成爲完整的東西－巴比塞」一保守派的意見堅特世界語是烏託邦的嘗試，但是循了法則逐漸進展着的現實，總是更堅决地否定了這些保守派的見解－高爾基」</p>
<p>舉行展覽會的目的在於展覽，標語和口號並不是牠的主要內容，所以現在我們應該掉過頭來看一看牠所陳列的究竟是些什麼東西：</p>
<p>世界語書籍——全世界世界語書籍總計在三萬種以上（不著名的無從統計），以五十年簡短的歷史來講，那是一　驚人的數目了。在內容方面，以敎學用書，文藝作品居多，社會科學次之，自然科學較少。這一决所陳列的，據說祗以書店方面備售的，圖書館方面購置的，及私人方面彙集的爲限，總數的穴七百種。其中比較著名的，有「柴門霍夫原作集」，有柴門霍夫所譯的「欽差大臣」，「諺語集」，「安徙生童話集」，莎士比亞的「漢姆雷德」等名著，有雷馬克「西綫無戰事」「戰後」的世譯本，有用各種不同文字說明的「世界語之鑰」。中國名著之被譯成世界語者也有多種，如區聲白譯的「三民主義」，鐘憲民譯的魯迅「阿Q正傳」，以及「論語」，「大學」，「孝經」之類也都有譯本。此外如日本野原休一譯的「佛說阿彌陀經」，據說在世界語書籍中，這類書要算是最別致內。至於字典方面，這裏訴中要算Edward　A．Millidge所編的“The　Esperanto－EnglisbDictionary”這一種，合成語最爲豐富。若論單字數量之多，則當首推日本石黑修的「日本世和字典」了。此外如「現代中文世界語辭典」，「世界語漢文模範字典正續編」這幾種，也都可稱善本。</p>
<p>世界語雜誌——世界語雜誌在全世界至少有五百種以上經常出版着，雖然在「質」一方面缺少厚大的世界語雜誌，但在「量」一方面却超過大多數國家用本國文出版的雜誌了。這裏所陳列的，據說是祇限於交換範圍以內。國外的的有二百種左右。共中最有價值的有「文學世界」，「我們的雜誌」，「科學雜誌」，「普羅文學」，「在前哨上」，「實用世界語」，「Pirate」這幾種。共內容或形式特別一點的，則有捷克盲人世界語協會機關誌「曙光」，以及關於天主敎生活，日本大本敎的刋物。他如專供兒童和我們姑女閱贖的也有。至於國內的世界語雜誌，也有五六十種之多，如上海，山西，雲南，一成都，南寗，蘇州，靑島，廣州，香港，溫州，北平，漢口等處都有世界語雜誌的刊行，不必說，上海出版的「世界月刋」要算是其中的「大阿哥」了。還有兩年前出版的申報業餘周刋世界語研究專號也陳列在那裹，計共出三期，的五萬言。</p>
<p>各國的世界語通信－與中國世界語者通信的國家，計有荷蘭，比利時，保加利亞，瑞典，瑞士，德，法，英，美，蘇聯，西班牙等國，其通信村料大都另用打字機印出，而日此項村料並不僅限於文字，還有國外世界語者寄來的澳洲植物標本，還有用世界語交換得來的畫片，照片以及印刷精美的標語，廣吿盡，郵票，郵片之類。此項畫片和照片，其性質的可分爲兩種：一種是描寫世界各地的風土人情，如「中世紀羅馬天主敎敎堂」，「瑞典十二世紀所建的屋子」，……這幾張，都值得一看；一種是關於蘇聯的新建設，如「工業大學」，「淘土工廠」，「列寗湖上的汽船」，「Dnjepro」的新式起重機」等都是。標語則以奧國的幾條反對吃烟的標語最令人觸目驚心，其中有一條，若把牠譯成中文，就是「烟草給你預備了一條到結核病的路」。記者手裏那時剛燃上了一支烟，見了這條嚇死人的廣吿，一時之際倒頗費了我一番躊躇，可是，轉瞬間，那支烟終於送到我嘴裹去了！至於郵票，記者因非郵票大王，對於此道向來外行，所以不想在這裹多談，但內中有一張「滿洲國登極紀念」郵票，却確是第一决見到，總算我今年又多了一番見識。</p>
<p>其他——其他如關於旅行方面的，有世界各著名城市的「世界語旅行指南」，中國，歐洲和荷蘭Groningen的世界語地圖，上海世界語者協會會員旅行松江，吳淞，蘇州及江灣葉園時所攝的各種照片。關於國內外世界語團體的，有第一决世界語展覺會的照片，以及上海世界語者協會第一，二，四决大會和其他國內外世界語團體的照片多種。關於世界語臨時傳授的，則有展覽會世界語簡易課，附設於會場內，敎法採用直接法，凡來會參觀而欲學習世界語者都可個別的授敎。此外，還有世界語日歷，世界語文法表解之類，因爲篇幅關係，這裹也不再一一細述了。</p>
<p>帶着展覽會贈閱的幾木世界語小冊子從會埸裹出來，路上遇見了某大學的校花羅女士。</p>
<p>「密斯會，你剛纔到什麼地方去了？我找了你半天都找不到，打電話到你府上，也說你不在。」</p>
<p>「我在卡德路參觀世界語展覽會呢。」</p>
<p>「世界語有什麼可看，我們看電影去罷！克勞黛考爾白的「鳳還巢」你看過嗎？據說很不錯，我來請客。」</p>
<p>「好了！」</p>
<p>近來不知怎的，我的舌頭被用壞到這樣的程度，不要說是慷慨激昂的言辭，就連一個吾定的詞兒也再吐不出來了！我想說：「不」，但我的舌頭却說：「好的」；我想走上正義的講臺，但我的舌頭却老是趦趄不前。我的心是和水晶一樣的淸，但我的　筋却和通過電流一樣的麻木。我周身感到了癱痰無力：我的手打不開黑暗的窗戶，我的　老是　不　，掙扎不起來，我聽不見塞外的砲聲，我看不淸千里外熊熊的火光，我嗅不到一絲一毫羣衆的氣息。眞的，一個三十歲以外的女人是已經不中用的了！　然綠色的星星在我懷裏閃着光，雖然我　身帶的有一個眞理，一件民族解放的武器——世界語，但這對於我又有什麼用處呢？</p>
<p>「……那怕　滾重如山，自由大路快築完，……」臘女士一　走，一壁帶着遊戲的態度在低聲地嚀着「大路歌」。</p>
<p>「我趕不上時代，我快要沒落了！」我的心這樣的嘆息着，眼淚從臉上掛了下來。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>中國文化建設的途徑</h3>
<p>— 林祝吾</p>
<p>中國今日的文化正在起急速的變化，這是誰也承認的事。我們的文化是東方式的，勢力的伸張已有悠久的歷史；一旦西方文化侵入，古派的厭惡牠，新派的使之變形。厭惡有程度深淺：深者視西洋文化爲毒蛇猛獸，如與接近，國家卽吿危亡；淺者說西洋文化無足爲奇，我們古紙堆中早已有過。變形也有程度深淺不同：深者唯洋是聽，不加抉擇，衣非洋裝，敎非基督，而恨不得搖身一變而爲碧眼黃髮；淺者便是所謂中西合璧，長衫加西裝袴，文明結婚而叩頭見禮。兩個深者因太頑固盲從，我們不予討論。兩個淺者則有討論的價值，牠們充滿於全中國，是吾正確，是吾有益，都待商酌。如正確與有益，可作爲建設之途徑；如不正確與不有益，應當加以指正並使之有益，這也是建設之途徑。我們討論時所具的觀點是「此時此地的需要」七字。</p>
<p>此時此地的需要是什麼？一言以蔽之曰：「科學」。現世紀，現世界，科學握霸權，一個國家若沒有科學，牠是不能生存的。中國處在二十世紀科學世界，唯有迅速發達科學。科學沒有國界，不能因其成功於西方而說我們是東方民族，西方科學不要牠。科學是世界的，說「洋」說「西」說「外」，眞是學究氣味太重。間題起來了：我們古書中沒有科學嗎？有的，而且很多，那你爲什麼不用「國貨」科學？關尹子言：「石擊石生光，雷電綠氣以生，可以爲之」。這是電學。墨子言：「化，徵易。若鼇爲鶉」。這是化學。周禮：「一易，再易，三易，草人稻人所掌」。這是農學。中庸：「山之廣大，終以寶藏興焉」。這是礦學。甚而至於左傳：「士傳言，庶人謗，商旅市，工獻藝」。所以要報館。大學：「生財大　　爲之者疾」。所以要　　路，　河　　及之　　　呼大　，南美洲之碑勒自華人。中國人眞偉大，除阿Q精神外，大都中了歷史酒精的毒。不是歐洲科學家哲學家極景仰希臘文化嗎？他們可如是反駁。我的回答是：景仰是景仰，却不會中毒失性而忘了創造；古代的科學見解只有送進博物館去的資格，不能拿出來應用。科學成功在西方，我們以墨子的片言斷語，漫無系統的見解爲化學呢？還是以西洋的整部大著，有系統有根據的學理爲依歸？關尹子與法拉第（Farady）的電學孰好？孰可拿出來應用？你當然明白的，那末，應該停止「古書裹有科學」的胡說。</p>
<p>至於中西合璧，我們的批評是這樣的。科學旣是此時此地的需要，我們應該要中西合璧。不看見中國的地質介紹在地質學書裏，等於白讀；農學書不說改造中國農業，應該是浪費紙張。但是科學以外的束西要不要中西合璧呢？我以爲要的，不過要擇其世界的，有益的，便利的。鋼筆寫中國字是便利，梵華鈴來替代並改良中國音樂是有益，拉丁字來拼中國語該是世界化。這幾種，我們應努力使之發展。獨立的文化模式應該保存，牠如果妨碍民族的生存與進步，也可以更改。我們認爲這種變形非常有益。</p>
<p>除此以外，我們要有選擇的眼光。西方而是壞的，我們要加以拒絕，因爲壞的西方文化能使民族退化。巴黎的裸體跳舞，舊俄的酗酒，都應在拒絕之列</p>
<p>還有一種西方文化，並不使民族退化，而且也有人歡迎，我們可使之自由。穿洋裝，吃西菜，我們不必禁北，也不必鼓勵，各隨所愛行了；何况時代的進展會顯出牠們的結果與命運的。</p>
<p>這樣，在變遷中的中國文化，共建設途徑可有下面四條：　科學絕對採取西方。　科學以外的東西如世界的，有益的，便利的？可採取或合璧。　西方而是壞的，禁止。　可以自由的，自由。</p>
<p>搖頭攏尾讀「子日」，與滿口：I　love　you，darning。不知什麼的，都是中國文化途上的障碍物，唯有一掃而光。</p>

<h3>丑角與正生</h3>
<p>— 明如</p>
<p>幼年時看戲的機會很多，久之便成爲了一種嗜好：如果兩天不進戲園，雖不像烟癮來了那麼打呵欠，流鼻涕，但心里總是怪癢癢的。可是我又非道地的「戲迷」，因爲對於戲的性質並不是無條件的喜好；如像「臣盡忠來子當盡孝」的那類高台敎化的正路戲，我總覺得很討厭。反之倒希望來一幕「打魚殺家」，或「李逵大鬧江州」，這並非是我天性好亂，實在由於前者太單調，後者比較緊張罷了。</p>
<p>然而我最高與看的還是要算丑角和花旦合演的浪蕩戲，因爲代們的形態和動作是那麼奇特古怪，挿科打諢又那麼談諧有趣，很能逗我發笑，很能滿足我的口味，所以我便歡迎牠。但我也不願自己被派爲丑角，倒想做一個正生，因爲我直覺的意識到正生都是高尙人物，丑角乃是下流之輩。不過究竟不明白丑角與正生的嚴格的分別：要怎樣的人物纔稱爲正生？怎樣的人物纔被派爲丑角？雖然我的長輩曾經向我解釋過：正生的行爲端正，心地光明，如關大聖，岳武穆這類人物，後人就尊他爲正生，而丑角，則行爲卑鄙，心腸惡劣，如秦檜之流便被派爲丑角。這話我起先倒也有點相信，可是後來轉而一想，也不盡然。假如丑角眞是代表「宵小」的話，那麼「孟津河」下釣魚爲生的張義，「小放牛」中的男女。都是各安本分的過着正當的生活，而且他們還沒有失掉天眞爛漫的孩子氣，說不上什麼卑鄙，奸險，幹嗎也變成爲丑角？又譬如「捉奸」中的武大郎，原是一個樸實的小販，他之當「王八」並非本意，他的老婆也不是天生的蕩婦，而是被人强佔，我看這齣戲的時候很覺得武大郎太可憐，一個職業低微的人兒連討一個漂亮的老婆都要被土豪惡棍垂涎和强奪，這多麼令人氣憤！而戲台上偏把他弄得醜頭醜腦，笑話百出，供人開心，惹人發笑，這是什麼用意？所以我對於「行爲卑鄙，心腸惡劣」代表丑角的話，生了很大的懷疑了。同時我又注意一看，劇台上的人物，所謂正生的完全是王公大人，富貴公子，而販夫牧豎，衙役皂隸，差不多每個人的臉上都塗有粉　，都派爲丑角，難道這些人的行爲和心腸都是卑鄙險惡嗎？反之如劉邦陳平輩，原是市井的土劣，無賴子，雖然後來立了一點「功業」，然而這種功業全是個人主義的而且還用了許多奸詐換來，照理他們的臉上應該塗點粉墨，派爲丑角，可是偏把他們遵爲正生。所以當時我已明白，戲台上的正生並不一定「行爲端正，心地光明」，不過因爲個人的勢力雄厚，被人尊敬和捧塲罷了。而所謂丑角也不是眞的「行爲卑鄙，心腸惡劣」，乃是由於職業卑微，受人輕視而已！</p>
<p>及到年齡漸長，知識漸開，我纔慢慢兒發覺到舊戲的初期原是宮庭中的娛樂品，所謂王公大人，飽食暖衣後，沒有正當工作打發悠久的時日，需要多想出一些玩意兒，以供自已的消遣，各種玩意看膩了，便命令文人偏製一些故事派人串演，故事要醜，劇中的人物也要醜，纔能刺戟他們那麻痺的腦筋，但醜事不能直接採取於自己的宮庭，府第，粉墨也不可點染在自己的臉上，於是民間的悲慘的故事便給文人改編爲淫蕩怪誕的戲劇，而悲慘故事中的善良的男女們便被他們强化爲刁鑽古怪的丑角了。因此戲台上的正生卽是王公大人自己，丑角便是老百姓！所謂丑角代表「宵小」的話全是扯幌子，雖然也有一二例外。</p>

<h3>人類與山嶽</h3>
<p>— 梅平</p>
<p>人類不僅生活於社會中，而且還生活在自然中，所以，河流，沙漠，山嶽，等自然存在的東西與人類都有非常密節的關係。在人類還沒有認識因而征服自然界的許多現象的能力之時，對於渺芒不可知的沙漠，一望無涯的汪洋大海，偉大壯麗的高山峻嶺，除了驚異，以極神秘的眼光去看待外，當然是不敢隨意去探究它的。事實上，在過去的神話時代中，無論中外，所有的人類，對於名山巨川都認爲是神靈棲息之所，並把牠們當作神靈來崇拜的。如過去有些皇帝貴族和風雅之士，往往愛到什麼海濱或什麼大山去求神仙，學神仙；叉如過去許多神話和神怪小說所表現的神仙妖怪棲息之所，大多是在山巓海濱的地方：這類事實，都足以充分表明過去人類與山嶽河流等的關係，表明那時人類對於山嶽河流等的認識。但是，在近代社會中，隨着產業和自然科學的發展，人類不僅知道了山嶽河流等並沒有什麼神秘性，而且還能探究它們，征服它們。不過，通常爲人所知道的，只是人類如何利用輪船去征服汪洋大海，如何利用飛機去征所珍邊的天空這類的事情；對於人類探察高山奇峯的經歷，對於人類征服山嶽一類的事，似乎還很少有人說過，而這些就是我們現在在這裹所要談到的。</p>
<p>在過去的中國，因爲閉關自守，所以一般人根本就不知道中國之外的世界，當然更不知道在中國之外的大山。「孔子登東山而小魯，登泰山而小天下」：這就足以表明過去中國人眼睛中所見的最大的山爲何如了。但在世界的意義上說來，泰山並不足以稱大山，就是中國的五嶽也都不足以言高大，它們都是很容易登上去的，根本用不着去探險，去征服。現在我們所要說的人類不斷努力去探察的山嶽，是高至一兩萬甚至兩三萬英尺的世界的高山，並不是我們可以輕易登上去的普通所稱的什麼「大山」。</p>
<p>先從歐洲說起。在歐洲最早登山的對象不消說是阿爾卑士山了。當十七八世紀的時候，就有許多詩人，文學家，科學者如達文西，盧梭，特尼生等去冒險探察這個歐洲最大的山，因之人們稱這時爲登阿爾卑斯山的黎明期。但在歐洲所謂劃期的登山，乃是十八世紀中葉的門布蘭高峯的征服。</p>
<p>門布蘭高峯是歐洲的最高峯，高一五，七八二英尺。對於這個高峯的征服，因爲道路的險阻，氣候的威力，起先很不容易成功；一直到一七八六年纔有伯加爾其人與引導者巴爾馬登到了峯頂。在這個壯烈的成功之後，接着更有許多登高山探奇峯者出現，不久幾乎把所有阿爾卑士山的高峯都征服了。於是在一八五七年英國山嶽會就首先宜吿成立，接着在一八六二年至一八七四年間，奧國，瑞士，意大利，德國，法蘭西，等的山嶽會也决第創立了起來。因之，十九世紀便被稱爲了阿爾卑士登山的黃金時代。</p>
<p>在阿爾卑士登山流行的時代中，登山家最輝煌的歷史記載是征服馬茲塔倫峯。這個高峯相傳是妖怪棲息之所，因之附近的居民對它都很恐怖，不敢前去探險。及至阿爾卑士登山的黃金時代到來時，才有一個以旅行寫生爲目的的靑年來到阿爾卑士地方，抱着征服馬茲塔倫的雄圖。這位靑年名叫維巴，他在一八六一到一八六五年間，對馬茲塔倫前後試行了八决的攻擊，纔將它征服了。但這個成功是頗不容易的，而且結果還演了悲劇。</p>
<p>本來在維巴開始征服馬茲塔綸時，即在他的所謂處汝征朋時，並沒有人來和他競爭。低後來意人加勒爾却不願別國人奪去了這個功勞，幾度與之爭功。而且，在最後，加勒爾更與意大利山嶽會的登山隊同行，想在維巴不知道的時候去實行登頂。維巴知道此事後當然馬上跑去競爭，從東面開始登山，這便演出了意大利人和英國人的登山競技。結果呢？英國靑年維巴勝利了，他達到了最高峯；但在下山的途中，因了同行者的過失，有四個人墜落了下來。道結果只是使得他感到數小時前的勝利而悄然下山了。</p>
<p>其次，世界著名登山的事蹟是在南美出現的。大家知道，南美的安達斯山是世界最長的山服。這個山脈北自巴拿馬地峽，南至合恩角，長達八〇〇〇〇〇〇米突，是被認爲縱貫南美大陸的怪山脈的。它有二萬個山岳，十數座高峯，一切情勢都不亞於阿爾卑士山。</p>
<p>安達斯山首先被征服的是金波拉左峯。這峯高達二〇，四九八英尺，征服它的也是征服馬茲塔倫的維巴。它是在赤道直下，但氣候却很寒冷，長年都在大雪中，而維巴們在當時又沒有冰鞋等物，所以進行起來極爲因難；同時，又因爲是在世界最高的活火山哥多波西的頂上，所以在那樣寒冷的空氣中，地下的熱氣却非常濃重，甚至可以熔解地下的樹膠；這樣的奇怪現象，當然就是曾經探過高山的維巴也未曾經騐過的。但由於他的艱苦奮鬥，從一八七九年的十二月起到第二年的一月，他終於把這金波拉左峯征服了。</p>
<p>但南美的最高峯乃是阿公加瓜（高二二，八三四英尺），這是在一八九六年由著名的英國登山家格拉爾特的遠征隊征服了的。據說他們在征服這個高峯中，會數决登上高至二萬英尺左右的地方，皆因風雪和寒氣等的阻止而又折回來了，最後雖然獲得了成功，但只有阿爾卑斯山的引導人扎布列庚和地質學者胡因斯達到了頂上，格拉爾特本人還未上去。單就這點看來，也可見到征服阿公加瓜峯確是頗不容易的。</p>
<p>同時，即是在十九世紀末和二十世紀初的時期內，菲洲大陸的最高峯乞力馬扎羅山（高一九，七一七英尺），第二峯怯尼亞山（高一七，二〇〇英尺），第三峯魯文左里山，也都巳先後被征服了。現在，剩下的便只有喜馬拉雅山了。</p>

<p>Osaka: Arita Hachiro, the newly appointed ambassador to China, gave a speech at a welcome party held at the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the 31st, stating that recently, the calls for economic cooperation between China and Japan have been growing stronger.

<h3>Independence of North China Postal Authority Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Huang Jiade, director of the Hebei Postal Administration under Chinese authority, stated in Tianjin that the rumors that the North China postal authority is independent and will be separated from the central government and directly under the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee have not been heard by the bureau as of today. The postal administration in this postal district is as it was before, and the bureau has not received any orders from any party regarding this matter or any investigation from any party. Although there is this kind of atmosphere, it is unlikely to be achieved in reality, because the postal service is not only related to the whole country, but also needs to be in contact with the world. It is difficult to break free and be independent in a hurry. The matter of the discovery of communists in Daming and Shunde in southern Hebei has not been heard. The bureau's mail is sent as usual. If there is such a situation, the local exchange must be stopped. Recently, the collection and exchange are as usual. Remittances from Guanwai have improved since last year, and the amount remitted from Guanwai is more than 20,000 yuan per month. There is not much remittance out of Guanwai. The business of the remittance transfer bureau can be maintained without loss. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>The Significance of Diplomatic Socializing in London</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In recent days, due to the funeral of the late British King George and the enthronement of the new King Edward, dignitaries from various European countries have gathered in London. Among the most important, in addition to the heads of several European monarchies, are French Foreign Minister Flandin, German Foreign Minister Neurath, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Austrian Chancellor Prince Starhemberg, and the foreign ministers of Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. These many diplomatic dignitaries have come to London by coincidence. On the surface, their purpose is half to offer condolences and half to congratulate. However, in addition to ordinary socializing, their meetings will have significant diplomatic implications.</p>
<p>The turbulence in the European political situation over the past year has had a major impact. That is, the center of European politics has gradually shifted from Paris to London. Especially after Germany's rearmament, Britain has gained a pivotal position between the two major groups of Germany and France. At the same time, it has used this position to influence the European situation and enhance its own strength. However, this ingenious method of imperialist diplomacy has also led to considerable crises. The secret expansion of the German Air Force, which threatens the west of the Rhine, is one such crisis. Italy's military buildup in East Africa, which threatens sea routes in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, is another. The unresolved Italian-Ethiopian War and the gradual increase in Hitler's preparations for war have made British rulers feel that it is not easy to use the European balance of power to enrich themselves. Therefore, in the recent Anglo-French agreement, Britain has shown some diplomatic concessions. But this concession is also a sign of retreating in order to advance. Currently, what Britain feels most urgently needed is to ease the crisis caused by the Italian-Ethiopian War. The main significance of the recent diplomatic socializing in London is that Britain is trying to adjust the balance of power among the entire European countries to strengthen its position in resolving the Italian-Ethiopian issue.</p>
<p>Currently, Britain's diplomatic activities are proceeding in two ways. First, to ease the crisis between Germany and France caused by the armed issue in the Rhine region. Britain wants France to jointly confront Italy with it. The fundamental condition is that it must be able to jointly confront Germany with France. However, after the recent Anglo-French agreement was reached, the German side immediately reacted strongly, indicating that it would restore the armament of the Rhine region. This is not only deeply feared by France, but also unwanted by Britain. The main point of Aiden's meeting with Neurath the other day was to dispel this threat from Germany. Second, to stabilize the situation in Central Europe and ease the conflicts between Austria, Hungary, and the countries of the Little Entente. Diplomatic activities in this area may have an important side effect. That is, Austria's shift from pro-Italian to pro-British. Britain has already been threatened by Italy in the Mediterranean. Now it will give Italy a threat from behind.</p>
<p>In addition to the above diplomatic activities, Litvinov's audience with the British Emperor and the temporary stay of Soviet Deputy Minister of the Army Tukhachevsky in London have other important diplomatic implications. Litvinov's meeting with Aiden specifically mentioned the danger of Germany's preparation to restore the armament of the Rhine region. This is calling Britain to be careful. The country that shouts slogans against the Soviet Union is also a dangerous thing for the imperialist world itself. Don't be fooled. In the European collective security movement, the Soviet Union is an important pillar. In the sanctions against Italy, the Soviet Union has helped Britain a lot. Now it also wants to test how sincere Britain is in dealing with other war provocateurs. The importance of this test is not limited to Europe alone. It also has a big role to play in East Asia.</p>

<h3>Four-Nation Naval Conference Passes Draft for Exchange of Shipbuilding Information; Mutual Notification Before May Each Year; Freedom to Consult on Disagreements</h3>
<p>London: The General Committee of the Naval Conference has passed a draft agreement on shipbuilding procedures, advance notification, and information exchange methods. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>The signatory nations' shipbuilding programs should be notified to other signatory nations between January 1st and May 1st each year.</p>
<p>Information must be exchanged regarding the characteristics of various warships, including tonnage, speed, gun caliber and quantity, anti-aircraft gun caliber and quantity, torpedo launchers, aircraft take-off and landing decks, aircraft launch devices, and the number of aircraft carried (the last three items apply specifically to aircraft carriers).</p>
<p>Construction of warships can only begin after the notification period has expired. In other words, if the notification deadline is April 30th, construction can begin no earlier than September 1st. Furthermore, each warship's keel laying and completion must be announced separately.</p>
<p>If, within four months after a signatory nation announces its shipbuilding program, there are changes to the program, or if any signatory nation raises objections to another nation's shipbuilding program, the signatory nations may consult with each other through diplomatic channels. However, whether or not to consult is at each nation's discretion and is not mandatory.</p>
<p>If a signatory nation purchases a new warship, regardless of whether it is wholly or partially completed, it must also provide information about the warship to other signatory nations. This clause is specifically designed for key naval powers, as it also allows them to join the agreement among the four nations of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States.</p>
<p>If signatory nations build warships on behalf of non-signatory nations, they must also declare this to other nations. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>French New Cabinet Gains Confidence of Chamber of Deputies; Receives a Majority of 196 Votes</p>
<p>After the questioning of the Premier by various parties in the Chamber of Deputies concluded today, Premier Sarraut delivered another speech at 3 PM, responding to the questions. At that time, the atmosphere in the chamber was tense and noisy. Sarraut said, "France is the repository of my lifelong faith. Tranquility and peace are what our country urgently needs, so that all industries can be revived, financial recovery can be achieved, and security can be maintained. If there is internal disintegration, danger will arrive. Those who seek opportunities to exploit and steal, to achieve their goals, will be delighted. Therefore, once I perceive mutual animosity among my compatriots, I am willing to gather various political factions and work together to bring them together under the same flag." Many deputies on the right criticized the new cabinet's complex organization. Premier Sarraut responded, "Although there are different factions among the cabinet members, they must all fulfill their responsibilities. There will be no difficulty in working together harmoniously. This is what I firmly believe." As for foreign policy, Sarraut's statement was entirely consistent with the speech delivered yesterday by Herriot, the former leader of the Radical Socialist Party. He said that France's continued pursuit of a policy of peace was not just empty words but came from the heart. Regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the government is constantly thinking of ways to help resolve it. In conclusion, he said, "We protect domestic peace to repel all violent mobs and outlaws. I firmly believe that protecting the republican system is protecting the motherland." After Sarraut finished speaking, Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party, rose to speak, explaining his party's attitude toward the Sarraut cabinet. He said that his party believed that the current cabinet had one merit: it replaced the previous Laval cabinet. If the current cabinet unfortunately collapses, the policies implemented by Laval will rise up, making a comeback. Léon Blum asked Premier Sarraut what attitude the current government would take toward curbing armed political groups and whether the current government would remain neutral during the next general election campaign. He said, "During the election campaign, there are often instances of bribery, intimidation, and abuse of power, such as promising honors and medals to voters. We have witnessed such acts and are deeply indignant. Do you have the determination to eradicate such behavior completely?" The whole chamber applauded in unison. The next speaker after Léon Blum was the Communist deputy, Berli, who said that his party would abstain from voting. "Our party will not vote against a middle-class cabinet, which is a first, because the current cabinet is better than the previous Laval cabinet." Subsequently, the deputy from the right wing, Taumont, said that according to the report of the Chamber of Deputies' Stavisky affair investigation committee, former Premier Chautemps was also involved in the case and is now serving in the new cabinet as Minister of Public Works, which is highly reprehensible. Finally, Premier Sarraut rose again to respond to Léon Blum's question, saying, "I dare to say that I will ensure that all laws for maintaining public order are implemented one by one. We are not taking this responsibility lightly. These laws are all in my control. I hope that you will trust me to implement them. I also hope that all deputies will always work together harmoniously to uphold electoral morality." It was already 6:30 PM, so a recess was announced to allow the parties to decide their attitude. At 7:00 PM, the meeting resumed, and a vote was held. As a result, the Sarraut cabinet won with 361 votes against 165. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hirota Pursues Amity Diplomacy with Britain and the United States; Hirota's Views Conveyed to the U.S. Government; Matsudaira Authorized to Negotiate with Eden</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota had requested the establishment of a trilateral Japan-Britain-U.S. regional peace-keeping mechanism to replace the League of Nations as a new peace organization. Now that the London Naval Disarmament Conference has broken down, Foreign Minister Hirota is determined to pursue the realization of his cherished policy. His statement in his diplomatic policy speech at the resumption of the 68th Diet, "establishing genuine world peace," is an expression of this policy. Its content is to ensure Japan's absolute dominance in East Asia, while in Europe and the Americas, Britain and the United States would be responsible for maintaining peace, with Japan, Britain, and the United States as the linchpin, maintaining world peace. Regarding this matter, Foreign Minister Hirota, upon the return of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew last year, asked him to convey this policy to the U.S. government. Secretary of State Hull, upon receiving the U.S. Ambassador's report, expressed broad agreement with the Hirota plan. The reason why U.S. public opinion was relatively calm when Japan withdrew from the London Disarmament Conference was because there was already an understanding of the Hirota plan. Similarly, Britain also fully understood Japan's position in the disarmament conference based on Japan's explanation. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota plans to authorize Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira, who is returning to his post in Geneva, to conduct concrete discussions with British Foreign Secretary Eden. At the same time, he will telegraph Ambassador to the U.S. Saito to begin negotiations with the United States. If the understanding of Britain and the United States can be obtained, then taking advantage of the opportunity of many influential U.S. politicians attending the coronation ceremony of His Majesty Edward VIII, what kind of agreement can be held among Japan, Britain, and the United States regarding this policy? Some also say that this move is sufficient to promote the conclusion of a separate disarmament agreement, which is extremely important. (Dentsu, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Reports Content of Soviet Protest; Hirota Seeks Direct Negotiations with Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to a telegram from Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ota to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomoniakov requested to visit Ambassador Ota late on the 30th, and lodged a protest regarding the Soviet-Manchukuo border conflict, as follows:</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM on the 30th, in the vicinity of Krotekov, near the eastern Soviet-Manchukuo border, in the vicinity of Mexijijielegexiya, Japanese-Manchukuo soldiers and four people in civilian clothes, carrying six dogs, crossed the border into Soviet territory and opened fire on Soviet border guards, killing and injuring several people. This area is located three miles from the border line within Soviet territory, so the responsibility lies with Japan and Manchukuo. The Soviet government reserves all rights regarding this matter. Ambassador Ota replied that he had not yet received a report on the details of the incident, but the cause of the incident was due to the ambiguity of the border line, so it cannot be determined that the incident was the crossing of the border by Japanese-Manchukuo soldiers. He will reply after investigation. Japan also reserves all rights, he said. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Hirota has transferred this protest to Manchukuo, requesting a report on the truth. However, the Foreign Minister believes that this matter should be negotiated directly between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo. (Dentsu, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Kwantung Army Announces Details of Manchukuo Army Mutiny; Conflict Occurred Near Mishan</h3>
<p>Changchun: The Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters today issued a statement stating that the recent mutiny of the Mishan "Manchukuo" border patrol was instigated by Soviet personnel. According to reports, on January 30th, a Russian soldier's body and several Russian-made gas masks were found among the bodies of the mutinous soldiers who were killed. After receiving news of the "Manchukuo" army's mutiny, the Japanese-Manchukuo army immediately sealed off the area north of Suifenhe on January 29th and patrolled it. The next afternoon, they engaged the mutinous soldiers, and the Manchukuo mutinous army fled into Russian territory. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Kwantung Army Headquarters today issued a statement in Changchun stating that on Thursday of last week, when the Japanese-Manchukuo army clashed with the mutinous army near Mishan, 10 Japanese soldiers were killed and 2 "Manchukuo" soldiers were killed.

<h3>Soviet Far East Defense: 800-Kilometer Highway Completed</h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet defense against Japan and the industrial system in the Far East have greatly improved today with the completion of the Khabarovsk-Vladivostok highway. The road is 800 kilometers long, and it now takes only 18 hours for passenger cars and only 30 hours for freight trucks to travel from the Far East Army Headquarters to Vladivostok. At the same time, it is reported that the laying of a double track on the Siberian Railway will also be completed within a few months. The Khabarovsk-Vladivostok highway project was arduous, taking 18 months from start to finish. Military experts predict that if Japan and Russia go to war, Japan will make Vladivostok its first target of attack. Now that there is this highway, Russia can easily transport troops.

<p>Moscow: Because the Buryat-Mongolians have successfully completed their animal husbandry plan, and have also achieved many successes in economic and cultural construction, the Soviet Central Executive Committee has awarded the Order of Lenin, the Red Banner of Labor, the Order of the Red Star, and certificates of honor to 60 leaders of the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, including male and female collective farmers, male and female workers from state-run farms, representatives of the labor intelligentsia, party and government workers, and commanders of cavalry regiments.

<h3>Japanese Persuading Everywhere; Saito Lectures in America; Maeda Courts Italy</h3>
<p>New York: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito gave a speech here today, saying that Japan's responsibility to stabilize the world's "backward areas" is similar to the influence that Britain and the United States previously exercised. Wherever Japanese go, they can improve the environment and benefit the local people. As for the Sino-Japanese cooperation that Japan is seeking, it is indeed motivated by sincerity. Saito also said that the ambitions of dictators in various countries are not just personal ambition, and there are no longer any short-sighted tyrants in the modern world who are dedicated to conquering others, because all countries have realized that the ambition of imperialism will ultimately lead to disaster. Japan's demand for naval equality with Britain and the United States is for security reasons, so that it will not be dominated by Western aggression by China and other countries near Japan. (National, 31st)</p>
<p>Rome: Maeda, a Japanese literature lecturer at the University of Rome, who served as a military reporter for the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun in the East African war zone, recently gave an interview to the Piccolo newspaper, saying that he admired the Italian expeditionary force's well-organized and bold actions. "Italy's claims regarding Abyssinia are legitimate and have moral value, which Japan understands very well. Japan and Italy need the same interests and aspirations, and their positions on the general political situation are also the same. They should reach a compromise and cooperate with each other, which is what Japan hopes for." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Commander-in-Chief of the Training Fleet was officially announced today as Vice Admiral Zen-go Yoshida. The Training Fleet consists of Iwate and Yakumo, carrying future admirals.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador to France Denies Japan-Germany Alliance</h3>
<p>Paris: According to a foreign affairs reporter for a business newspaper, Germany and Japan have signed a treaty of friendship, which also contains elements of a military defense agreement.

<h3>Japanese Minister of Education Konda Supervises Death of Matsuda; Kawasaki to Succeed to Vacancy</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Minister of Education Genji Matsuda passed away due to a heart attack at 2:20 PM today, at the age of 62.</p>
<p>Minister Matsuda went to a relative's funeral at 10:00 AM one day, and returned home via the Imperial University. He returned home at noon and intended to visit the Imperial Family in the afternoon. He went upstairs to change clothes and suddenly felt unwell and collapsed on the ground. His family urgently summoned a doctor for treatment, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Minister Matsuda passed away suddenly due to a serious illness today. It has been confirmed that the successor to Minister of Education is Takukichi Kawasaki (Secretary-General of the Minseito Party). (Dentsu, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Minister Matsuda was an important figure in the Minseito Party. Due to his noble character and flexible political skills, he was invited to join the current cabinet. Losing such talent while the general election is in progress has a major impact on the government and the Minseito Party. (Domei, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It was decided that Minister of Commerce Machida, following Prime Minister Okada's intentions, would negotiate with Takukichi Kawasaki, who will assume the position of Minister of Education. His statement is as follows: "When I went to Kanagawa Prefecture on the 31st to support Mr. Noda's speech, I met Minister Matsuda and said that he was suffering from coughing and was very distressed. Now that I have received the news of his sudden death, it is like a dream. When Mr. Tokonami passed away, the Minseito Party also actively campaigned for the successor issue. This decision will be left to Prime Minister Okada and President Machida." (Dentsu, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The current Minister of Education, Genji Matsuda, who suddenly passed away today, was from Oita Prefecture and was born in Meiji 8. He was the eldest son of Ginbei Matsuda. After graduating from Nihon University, he passed the Higher Civil Service Examination and the Judge and Prosecutor Appointment Examination, and served as a judicial official. He then changed his career to become a lawyer. Since Meiji 41, he has been elected by his hometown as a member of the House of Representatives, and has continued to be elected as a powerful fighter of the Minseito Party. When the Okada cabinet was established, he became Minister of Education. After taking office, he worked hard to reform education, especially on the issue of clarifying the national essence, he demonstrated his skills, and resolutely reorganized the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, injecting a strong stimulant into the corrupt art world, which caused a sensation in public opinion. He had excellent rhetorical skills and was a key figure in the Okada cabinet along with Minister of Railways Uchida. (Dentsu, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Takukichi Kawasaki, a native of Hiroshima Prefecture, was born in January of Meiji 4. In Meiji 36, he graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University, passed the Higher Civil Service Examination, and studied local administration at the Graduate School. From Meiji 37, he served as the police chief of Fukui and Nagasaki Prefectures, the director of the internal affairs of Ishikawa Prefecture, the police chief of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the governor of Fukushima Prefecture, the police chief of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, and the director of the Internal Affairs Bureau. In Taisho 11, he was appointed as the mayor of Nagoya. In Taisho 13, he served as the director of the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In Taisho 14, he was promoted to the internal affairs officer. In Taisho 15, he was appointed as a member of the House of Peers.

In November of the same year, he was appointed as an attaché to the plenipotentiary of the London Naval Conference. In April of Showa 6, he was appointed as the chief cabinet secretary and resigned in December. (Domei, 1st)</p>
<h3>Litvinov and French Foreign Minister Discuss International Situation; Focusing on Collective Action</h3>
<p>Paris: Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov met with Foreign Minister Flandin this morning. According to inquiries made by our reporter, the two discussed not only the general international situation, but also the following issues: (1) the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, which has not yet been ratified by the French parliament since it was signed in early May last year; the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to put it up for discussion on the 11th of this month; (2) the loan issue; the Franco-Soviet agreement was announced on the 6th of last month, but no agreement has yet been reached on the issue of Soviet purchases of goods from French industry, which should be discussed further; (3) the issue of organizing a European collective security system. Although Litvinov and Flandin refused to issue any statement on the details of today's talks, negotiations on collective security issues have been ongoing for some time. Litvinov took advantage of his trip to England to attend the funeral of George V yesterday to discuss with British King Edward VIII and Foreign Secretary Eden. French Foreign Minister Flandin also met with British authorities several times. When French Premier Sarraut gave his cabinet's policy statement in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, he also said that France's foreign policy, which has been adopted for 20 years, should continue to be adhered to. In other words, it should abide by the obligations stipulated in international treaties and announce a collective security system in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations. All of this is clearly related to the issue of European collective security. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Reportedly, Britain, France, and Italy Will Sign Mediterranean Pact; Other Countries Will Also Join</h3>
<p>According to our reporter, following the recent meeting between French Foreign Minister Flandin and British Foreign Secretary Eden, Britain, France, and Italy will soon hold negotiations to sign a Mediterranean pact. According to the current proposed plan, countries along the Mediterranean coast will pledge that if one of the signatory nations is invaded, the other signatory nations will have an obligation to help each other. The pact will first be signed by Britain, France, and Italy, and then extended to Spain, Greece, Turkey, and other countries. According to semi-official observers, the above proposal may be welcomed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This is because when Mussolini recently met with British Ambassador Sir Drummond, he said that although Italy's withdrawal of troops stationed in Libya in Africa, or Britain's withdrawal of warships from the Mediterranean Sea, would be sufficient to ease the situation in the Mediterranean, in his view, it would be better to resolve the Mediterranean issue on a broad scale. It is generally believed that once the Mediterranean pact is established, it may make Italy's attitude towards resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute more moderate. However, although semi-official figures still express doubts about whether this will open the door to Italo-Ethiopian peace talks, they do not oppose the discovery of this new path in the face of desperation. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Issues Order to All Soldiers and Civilians; Prepare for Future Crisis</h3>

<p>All wool sheared nationwide next time will be used by the army.</p>
<p>The number of army areas nationwide will be increased from five to eight.</p>
<p>People seeking employment must obtain a license from the government. The license must state the applicant's physical fitness and military training level.</p>
<p>Increase the single tax.</p>
<p>Allocate 7 million lire to provide relief to the families of fallen and wounded party soldiers. (National, 31st)</p>
<p>Rome: The government newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia recently published an article entitled "To the Students of Europe," strongly urging young people to unite to prevent a major war that could be caused by sanctions against Italy. This article appears to have been authorized by Prime Minister Mussolini. It said, "The ban on oil can lead to a naval blockade. Once a naval blockade is implemented, war will follow. People generally believe that a coalition of many countries against Italy will easily win, but this is a big mistake. It must be known that Italy is fully prepared to deal with national disasters and will definitely defend the country with all its strength." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome: The Fascist Party's Supreme Council meeting tonight at 10:00 PM is considered very important here. Prime Minister Mussolini will chair the meeting, so the atmosphere has been unusually tense in the past day. The Supreme Council will discuss the current situation and decide on Italy's future policy on the oil ban. (National, 1st)</p>
<h3>No Fighting in East Africa</h3>
<p>Rome: A report from the commander of the Italian forces in East Africa was received here today, stating that there was nothing to report. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London: The headquarters of the Ethiopian forces in Tassai issued a communique today stating that the Italian forces were defeated in the recent fierce fighting in the Danbian area. The Italian forces launched an offensive, attacking the positions held by the Ethiopian forces. After a brief engagement, the Italian forces collapsed. The Ethiopian forces captured a total of 33 field guns, 725 machine guns, 2,654 rifles, and 18 tanks. More than 3,000 Italian soldiers' bodies were left on the battlefield, and 5,000 were wounded. The Ethiopian side had fewer than 1,200 killed or wounded. The Ethiopian communique continued, saying that the Ethiopian army's victory in the Danbian area proves that the Ethiopian army can defeat the enemy in field battles or other strategies. In this major battle, the Ethiopian army initially abandoned field battle methods and used dense formations to counter the real offensive of the Italian army, and dispelled the Italian army's hope of victory. The communique continued, saying that the two sides' movements indicated that there were initially some small contacts in the mountains of Abbi Addi, etc., and then the main forces of the two sides clashed in a series of battles for ten days. The Italian side used tanks, artillery, and aircraft to support its infantry, but these weapons were ineffective against the Ethiopian army, which fought desperately. The Ethiopian army always engaged in close combat and fought to the death whenever possible. On January 28, the Italian side deployed the famous Blackshirts to help in the battle, which was their last resort, but they still failed to stop the Ethiopian army's advance. The Italian army finally failed, but was still able to retreat in an orderly manner. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Asmara: Our special correspondent, Barcell, reported that the observation team from the countries that did not participate in the sanctions, namely Austria, Hungary, Albania, and Japan, consisting of military officers from the four countries, has arrived here and will be received by personnel from the Propaganda Department, and then go to the headquarters of the Italian forces on the northern front. This observation team was invited by the Italian government. One of the members of the team is General Pommer, a senior official in the Austrian Ministry of Defense, who served in the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the European War.

<h3>Political Disputes Arise Again Among Greek Parties; Military Opposes Venizelos</h3>
<p>Athens: A Greek newspaper recently issued an extra edition, publishing a message stating that military leaders have decided to apply to the cabinet today, to be forwarded to the king, that the mandate to form a cabinet should not be given to the Liberal Party led by former Prime Minister Venizelos, believing that after the party forms a cabinet, it will inevitably make major changes to military personnel, and the result will endanger the current army system. The newspaper also said that the military leaders, considering that no political party in the newly elected House of Representatives has obtained an absolute majority and will not be able to support any government in the future, deliberately want to demand a new election. Prime Minister Demertzis and Army Minister General Papagos recently denied this news from the newspaper. The Army Minister also decided to close the newspaper office. It is reported that King George II will personally resolve military issues and will no longer rely on political leaders. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek government's troops are on high alert today because of rumors that General Kondylis was poisoned by the Venizelos faction, so there are fears that Kondylis' subordinates may riot in the capital. All members of the Venizelos faction across the country heard the news of Kondylis' death and rejoiced and danced. The authorities are also afraid that someone will resent their celebration and a riot will occur. The "Patris" newspaper published the news of Kondylis' death with the headline "The Dictator is Dead, Long Live Freedom". (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>Athens: All military officers who were executed for participating in the March Revolution last year have recently been said to be reinstated after King George II issued an amnesty decree last winter. This matter is opposed by military personnel. According to various newspapers, the military authorities conducted major activities yesterday, and staff officers held several meetings and decided to express their disagreement with the reinstatement of these officers. It is reported that Prime Minister Demertzis firmly believes that this issue must be resolved by the cabinet before the House of Representatives meets on March 12, but the military authorities have denied the claim that staff officers have taken action. The Army Ministry even advocated that newspapers that published this news should be punished. Newspaper reporters went to the barracks for inspection and did not see any unusual movements.

<h3>Austrian Restoration; Little Entente Resolves to Oppose; The Whereabouts of Starhemberg</h3>
<p>London: Austrian Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg came here to attend the consecration ceremony and took the opportunity to meet with representatives of the Little Entente countries to explore their opinions on the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. As a result, the Little Entente countries all held a strong opposition attitude. Therefore, when Prince Starhemberg returns to his country, he is hesitant about whether to visit Archduke Otto, the successor of the former Habsburg royal family, along the way. It is rumored that when Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu met with Prince Starhemberg, he stated that if the restoration is realized, the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia will immediately send troops to Austria, and Romania will also send troops to help. At that time, Germany will take advantage of the situation of unrest in Central Europe to overthrow the Schuschnigg cabinet to realize the German-Austrian merger plan, which will instead create opportunities for Germany. Therefore, for Austria's sake, it is not advisable. It is better to approach the Little Entente countries, which will be more beneficial. British Foreign Secretary Eden also reportedly used this to persuade Starhemberg. (Havas Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Vienna: According to our reporter, the fourth year of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany has just begun, but in terms of Austria's internal and foreign affairs, Hitler's long-advocated policy of German-Austrian merger has clearly failed. In terms of internal affairs, the organization of various vocational groups has gradually consolidated the legislative system created by the late Prime Minister Dollfuss and is now progressing smoothly. For example, the unified trade union has 300,000 members, accounting for 40% of the country's workers. Previously, the Social Democratic Party had recruited about 80% of the country's workers, but now some of them have joined the unified trade union. In addition, the Patriotic Front is also progressing smoothly, including 2 million fighters, in other words, 45% of the country's adults are in this group. As for the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg, it is now as stable as a rock. Not only is there no conflict of opinions among the cabinet members, but the entire army also unanimously supports it and there is no objection. Among this army, there are now 100,000 people who have received military training. In the time of the late Prime Minister Dollfuss, there were only 30,000 militiamen. As such, if the Austrian National Socialist Party does not have the assistance of German soldiers, it is already at the end of its strength and cannot do anything. These people are only engaged in propaganda in secret. However, from an incident that occurred in the party recently, we can see that the party members still have a kind of terroristic organization in Austria. In terms of diplomacy, the country politely opposes the implementation of sanctions. On the one hand, it strives to maintain friendship with Italy, but on the other hand, it knows how to obtain the sympathy of Britain and the Little Entente countries. For example, when the Austrian bank encountered difficulties, Britain has agreed to start negotiations with Austria to ensure the security of the bank's future. In addition, the national patriotic sentiment has been revitalized, and the concept of loyalty to the monarch has also been stimulated. At present, a large part of the people, from the authorities to the common people, advocate that the former Habsburg royal family should ascend the throne again. This is opposed by Yugoslavia, the Czech Republic, Romania, and German leader Hitler. Among them, Hitler's opposition is very strong, and Yugoslavia does not allow changes. Now the royalists are planning to negotiate with Yugoslavia, the Czech Republic, and Romania to find a proper solution. The attitudes of the Czech Republic and Romania have become slightly more moderate, but Hitler's attitude may not change. Therefore, in the future, if you want to know the future of the Austrian restoration movement, you must first understand what policy the German leader Hitler will adopt on this matter.

<h3>King Edward VIII Becomes Marshal of the Army and Navy; Prayers in Churches Slightly Revised</h3>
<p>London: The London Gazette announced today that King Edward has assumed the position of Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: The London Gazette announced today that the prayers in churches will be slightly revised in the future, adding prayers for King Edward, Queen Mary, and the Duke and Duchess of York. From now on, King Edward's mother will be known as Queen Mary. The reason for adding the Duke and Duchess of York to the prayers is that King Edward is a bachelor, and according to the law, his younger brother, the Duke of York, is the heir to the throne, and his position is equal to that of the crown prince.

<h3>South African Prime Minister Agrees with League of Nations Action; Sufficient to Protect Small Countries</h3>
<p>Cape Town, South Africa: South African Prime Minister General Hertzog said in a speech to Parliament yesterday, "The actions taken by the League of Nations in handling the Italo-Abyssinian dispute are to safeguard the independence of small countries. In the view of our government, this is the greatest attempt at collective action. Italy is invading Abyssinia with its powerful military force. If it is allowed to do what it wants, the impact will be that all countries with overpopulation will rise up and follow suit, conspiring to covet the vast lands of the world. The South African Federation is also a country with vast lands, and it will be difficult to escape at that time." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London: Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, recently expressed his opinion on the issue of sanctions against Italy, saying, "The embargo on petroleum is an urgent matter and should have been implemented long ago. Some people are afraid that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will consider it an act of war, so they advocate that Britain should not implement an oil embargo. I don't know that the current sanctions are ineffective, and forcing them will only reduce the meaning of the sanctions." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: It was learned here today that Italy has been purchasing petroleum with foreign currency and importing it continuously since the League of Nations sanctions against Italy began in mid-November last year. As for the news from Geneva that Italy's petroleum purchases are sufficient for the entire year, and that the source is Romania, this is not very credible here, because Italy lacks proper oil storage facilities, and if the League of Nations passes a petroleum embargo, Romania may not be able to continue to supply it.

<h3>Twenty African Americans Burned to Death in a Vehicle in the United States; Two Others Critically Injured</h3>
<p>Scottsboro, USA: Twenty black criminals died tragically here today. These twenty black people were detained in a vehicle with wire mesh on all sides.

<h3>The Intensifying Competition of Japan's "Election Purification" (2)</h3>
<p>— Heng Zhi</p>
<p>——As an Overture to War Preparations During "Extraordinary Times"——</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Both the dissolution of the Diet and the currently intensely competitive election should be viewed as part of the war preparations process.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai, the opposition party to the current cabinet, is largely concerned with the interests of the Mitsui zaibatsu system. The Minseito, the current cabinet's party, is more concerned with the Mitsubishi zaibatsu system. The Seiyukai currently has around 1.5 million yuan in election campaign funds. The Minseito has about the same. In the primaries, the Seiyukai had over 240 candidates elected. The Minseito was short by thirty to forty. The claim to be "large" is uncertain due to election irregularities. Both major parties are vying for a majority. Other parties, such as the Kokumin Domei, Showakai, and Shakai Ta衆to (both left and right wings), each hold only about ten seats. The total number of Diet members is currently set at 466.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the campaign platforms of each party. By examining these platforms, we can also understand the inside story of the previous Diet dissolution and the conflicts between the factions.</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun's January 23rd publication, the campaign platforms of each faction are as follows:</p>
<p>Seiyukai:</p>
<p>Shatter the bureaucratic-centric, pretense of "national unity," establish responsible politics for political parties, stabilize the wavering political situation, and, in response to the extraordinary times at home and abroad, realize a powerful cabinet capable of implementing consistent policies.</p>
<p>Reject the current cabinet's lame financial policies, centered on national defense but neglecting industrial relations, and ensure that both national defense and industry thrive. To this end, overturn the gradual reduction of public debt, justified by sound finance and based on passivity; rely on public debt financing to expedite fundamental fiscal reforms in the pursuit of national policies.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Seiyukai denounces the Minseito as a tool of the bureaucracy. The current cabinet's investigation of the Minobe Tatsukichi's, advocates of the Emperor as an organ of the state, liberals is not thorough. The Seiyukai believes that "the 'essence' of the national polity has been immutable since the founding of the nation," so "clarifying the national polity" has become a weapon for the Seiyukai to attack the current cabinet. It is now also one of the election topics.</p>
<p>In summary, the Seiyukai's campaign slogans are:</p>
<p>(1) Bureaucracy or political party?</p>
<p>(2) Pretense of national unity or genuine national unity?</p>
<p>(3) Stability or instability?</p>
<p>(4) Lame or thriving in both ways?</p>
<p>(5) Active or passive?</p>
<p>(6) Prosperity or recession?</p>
<p>Seiyukai policies:</p>
<p>(1) Implementation of proactive, independent diplomacy and enrichment of economic diplomacy.</p>
<p>(2) System reform—correct the bureaucratic tendency of playing with job security, leading to laziness and arrogance.</p>
<p>(3) Establish a local finance adjustment system to alleviate local financial difficulties.</p>
<p>(4) As an industrial countermeasure, rationalize consumption, lower power and transportation costs, and improve experimental research institutions. Thoroughly manage mountains and rivers. Simultaneously promote the following policies:</p>
<p>(A) Resolve the rice, silk cocoon, and fertilizer problems according to the policies since the previous Diet; (B) Implement rural revitalization based on strengthening local autonomy's economy; (C) Establish a commercial and industrial central bank of considerable scale; (D) In order to adapt to the principles outlined below, promote industrial control and public interest, promote the healthy development of industry, and establish a long-term central control committee.</p>
<p>(5) Fiscal policy, namely, the principle of balancing military strength and agricultural productivity. In addition, oppose the government's oppression of them in the election using "official" and "full" authority.</p>
<p>The Minseito supports the current cabinet; it also loudly advocates national unity in order to overcome the "extraordinary situation." Its ten major policies are:</p>
<p>(1) Reject fascism and establish constitutional politics:</p>
<p>(A) Eradicate the fascist trend, (B) Reform and strengthen political parties, (C) Thoroughly purify elections and seek the free expression of public opinion.</p>
<p>(2) Freedom of trade, development of resources, rationalization of population distribution, and establishment of an independent foreign policy based on East Asian stability:</p>
<p>A Promote international coexistence and co-prosperity,</p>
<p>B Ensure East Asian stability,</p>
<p>(3) Establish an economic and independent national defense plan with the goal of East Asian stability: (A) Scientific strengthening of military equipment, (B) Enrichment of air defense and aviation facilities, (C) Independent maintenance of various warships, (D) Prevention of naval arms race.</p>
<p>(4) Comprehensive strengthening of industry, national defense, and finance; (A) Rationalization of budget allocation, (B) Localization of national defense industry, (C) Promotion of private aviation business, (D) Establishment of public debt policy, (E) Establishment of comprehensive industrial policy.</p>
<p>(5) Establishment of a progressive trade policy and establishment of a comprehensive scientific research institute: (A) Thorough dissemination of export associations, (B) Expansion and strengthening of regional export compensation and compensation conditions... securing overseas resources, promoting and encouraging outstanding ships...</p>
<p>(6) Thorough measures for rural revitalization; (A) Thorough dissemination of debt reorganization, (B) Balancing burdens, (C) Stabilizing income, (D) Implementing mountain and river management projects.</p>
<p>(7) Establishment of a system of local finance adjustment grants.</p>
<p>(8) Improvement of the tenant farming system and expansion and strengthening of owner-farmers.</p>
<p>(9) Organization of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists and thorough implementation of low-interest loans.</p>
<p>(10) Adjustment of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists and industrial associations: (A) To alleviate the plight of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, establish a commercial and industrial central bank to provide financial mutual aid, (B) Rural economic revitalization should be centered on industrial associations, (C) Consolidate the guidance and supervision agencies of various industrial associations.</p>
<p>Its slogans are:</p>
<p>1. Comprehensive strengthening of military, industry, and finance.</p>
<p>2. Stabilizing the lives of the masses.</p>
<p>3. Co-prosperity and interdependence of agriculture, commerce, and industry.</p>
<p>The Minseito's counterattack against the Seiyukai:</p>
<p>1. National unity or struggle for political power?</p>
<p>2. National essence or "party strategy"?</p>
<p>3. Construction or destruction?</p>
<p>In addition, the Kokumin Domei advocates "Japanism," advocating "unification of national defense and diplomacy," and proposes five items:</p>
<p>(1) Unification of national defense, diplomacy, and "national consensus"—in order for Japan, as a force for East Asian stability, to act effectively, military and diplomatic actions must be consistent.</p>
<p>(2) Job allocation for the rapidly increasing population—various policies such as securing markets, obtaining raw materials, reducing power costs, and distributing industry to rural areas must be implemented.</p>
<p>(3) Implementing a national health policy to maintain the excellence of the nation—advocating the establishment of a Ministry of Health (i.e., a Department of Health).</p>
<p>(4) Rejecting corrupt behavior that poisons the national spirit—in recent years, crimes by government officials, public officials, and party members have increased significantly. In order to prevent these, legislative improvement, administrative supervision, and the advancement and retreat of politicians are also of great importance.</p>
<p>(5) Balancing the burden on the people—the heavy emphasis on industry and commerce since the Meiji era has ultimately concentrated the wealth of the country in the cities. The simplest proof is that, according to the current ratio of national tax to local tax burden, the local middle class, which is the backbone of Japan, is in a state of decline.</p>
<p>The Showakai advocates national unity and supports the Takahashi finance policy. The Showakai's platform is roughly the same as the ten major platforms announced by the current cabinet when it was first formed—strict discipline, inspiring public morale,</p>
<p>International goodwill, national defense security, financial stability, stable livelihood, comprehensive industrial policy, educational reform, administrative improvement, and co-existence and co-prosperity policy towards Manchuria.</p>
<p>The Shakai Ta衆to, of the proletariat camp, especially wants to reject fascism. They use joining the Diet as a tactic of rejection. In the Diet, they can say things that they would not dare to say publicly in ordinary times. In the Diet, established parties such as the Seiyukai and Minseito only dare to use vague language such as balancing military strength and agricultural productivity when it comes to war and military expenditure issues, and they avoid criticizing those issues. However, they (Seiyu, Minsei) advocate upholding parliamentary politics, so it is also necessary to strengthen the anti-fascist movement by leveraging this point. For this reason, the proletarian camp, which can criticize, is even more daring to engage in independent parliamentary struggle. Within the proletarian front, there are also distinctions between the left and right wings and centrists. Although this may result in differences in the intensity of action, it seems to be more powerful than during the period of disunity under today's efforts for "frontline unity." This is the most interesting point of this general election.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Going North</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>8 Establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council</p>
<p>Since the conclusion of the truce agreement between China and Japan in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], and the demarcation of the East Hebei War Zone, the gate to the north of China has been opened to invite bandits, and lurking traitors have been given an opportunity to steal. Now that Yin Rugeng has indeed established a puppet organization in East Hebei, the fate of North China feels even more precarious. Furthermore, since the Hebei-Chahar Incident occurred, up to Song Zheyuan sitting firmly in Beiping and Tianjin, Sino-Japanese negotiations have been conducted by people such as Xiao Zhenying and Chen Juesheng (Chen is not an old subordinate of Song, but was recommended by Doihara Kenji) secretly seeking understanding from Doihara, thus resulting in the appearance of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council. After the establishment of the council, a Foreign Affairs Committee was immediately established, handling so-called "local incidents" on its own, thereby the council seemingly possesses special foreign affairs powers. However, Sino-Japanese diplomacy is fundamentally in a state of opposition. Before a complete and genuine adjustment can be achieved, any negotiations (including those related to the so-called local incidents devised by the other party to avoid attention) are bound to fail easily and succeed with difficulty. Even if the situation is sometimes eased and one-sidedly self-proclaimed as successful from a certain perspective, it is merely holding onto an empty reputation. This does not need future inevitable facts to prove. Observe the purpose of the final act of the so-called public self-government petition directed by a third party, and the actors who are too eager have already made blatant expressions. If you don't believe me, please look at a brief description of the script.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council officially taking the stage to perform, a third party deceived themselves and others. Under the smoke screen of "public spontaneity," they actively orchestrated various troupes, including the so-called "North China Self-Government Promotion Association," "North China Rural Relief Association," "Chinese People's Self-Government Joint Council," "Hebei County Representative Joint Council," "East Asia Peace and Great Unity Alliance," "Hebei New Autonomous Government," "China Anti-Communist United Association," and "East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee," etc. Although the names are numerous, they are all from the same mold. On each stage, there are considerable activities, such as hiring poor people and beggars who smoke opium, inject morphine, each person is given four cents per decision, riding in cars in groups, pretending to petition the government for self-government, in order to confuse the public. At first glance, the appearance of various forms is like a lively event, but in reality, these puppet clowns are all "×× special service agencies" and first-class traitors who take advantage of the fire, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. However, this cannot be said to be the director's full ability, nor has the full view of the plot been completed. The purpose of the director of the ugly drama, the key point of expression, lies in the fact that, like the aforementioned "China Anti-Communist United Association," which petitioned Japan to send troops to fight communism, secretly wrote a letter stating, "(Omission) Now that the communists have advanced from Xinjiang, Gansu, Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Eastern Asia, the anti-communist front in East Asia is unstable, and the anti-communist forces in North China are weak. If Japan sits idly by, China will be defeated. The red disaster is unimaginable. Your country must send troops to jointly suppress the communists in order to have hope of cooperating in clearing them away. Earnestly presenting our words, we respectfully request your examination," etc. The words and meanings are absurd and unparalleled. Furthermore, the rebel committed the great crime against the world and formed the pseudo "East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee." After just over a month, they changed the pseudo name to "East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government," recognizing the thief as the father, intercepting national land taxes (more than 2.8 million yuan in local taxes each year, more than 2 million yuan in provincial taxes, and more than 5 million yuan in central taxes, totaling more than 10 million yuan per year). Not only did they secede national territory and destroy finance and economy, but if negotiations with the relevant parties to cancel the issue, they would even propose the condition of reorganizing the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council into the "Hebei-Chahar Anti-Communist Council." The third party's ruthlessness and sinister intentions can be said to have reached the extreme.</p>
<p>In short, although Japan's diplomatic tactics towards China have a variety of tricks, using both orthodox and unorthodox methods, the consistent policy has not changed due to people or places. Only the magic hand currently extending to North China, comprehensively deciding to restore the Qingdao garrison, increase the Beiping-Tianjin garrison, add special service agencies in Suiyuan and Taiyuan, and strengthen East Hebei and North Chahar's negotiation issues, etc., is clearly using the shield of anti-communism and anti-Soviet Union to plot to control our North China by force, and to divide our country's political units separately to complete the consistent policy of gradually controlling the entire country. The authorities who alone support half of North China should not lack a complete understanding of the principle that "what the neighbor values is what I devalue," and "the enemy wants to divide, I benefit from unity."</p>
<p>What's more, recently, the "Tanggu" and "Chaoyangmen" incidents occurred. The brief situation is as follows: In the Tanggu incident, a treacherous merchant transported smuggled goods and was arrested by the police. A certain related foreign firm wanted to provide unreasonable protection and destroyed the flag to frame them, falsely accusing them of insulting Japan. In the Chaoyangmen incident in Beiping, after the gate was closed at night, a few Japanese soldiers suddenly entered the city with orders. The guards delayed opening the gate slightly due to procedural reasons. The other party was dissatisfied and fired a gun to demonstrate. Although the guards also fired back into the sky, none were injured. The other party intended to provoke a quarrel, so it was also listed as a negotiation issue. The rights and wrongs of the two incidents are clear. However, the Japanese Veterans Association in Beiping still issued a declaration, believing that this was an anti-Japanese and anti-"Manchukuo" situation, and it was difficult to remain silent. Furthermore, one party believes that "if Song's army, because of the Japanese side's lenient attitude, grows in arrogance, causing the re-enactment of insulting Japan behavior, then there is no other way but to resort to active means and decisively repel them." This kind of arrogance, which can both value and devalue, is pressing. The Political Affairs Council, which has only been born for a month, must feel deeply about this.</p>
<h3>Changping National Team Conflict Resolved The Japanese Side Has Not Abandoned the Claim of Autonomy for Hebei and Chahar Li Shou-hsin Established a Pseudo Temporary Government in Zhangbei</h3>
<p>Beiping Newsletter: The Changping County dispute has been resolved. The cause of the incident was a misunderstanding between the local security team led by Feng Shoupeng and the local militia, which once deteriorated. Later, it was mediated by gentry and subsided. The escape of Changping County Magistrate Zhang Jingfan is unknown. The rumor that he has arrived in Tongzhou is not true. Currently, the militia is temporarily maintaining order in Changping City. Feng's security team is stationed at Longshan, eight miles from the east gate. All stores in the city and suburbs have now resumed business.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent rumors that Zhangjiakou and the Ping Sui Railway have been occupied by Japanese and puppet troops, but according to Japanese official reports, Japanese and puppet troops have not recently invaded Chahar Province. Although Song Zheyuan's troops and the Mongolian army have agreed on a method for changing some defensive positions within Chahar Province, Zhangjiakou and the Ping Sui Railway are still maintaining security by Song's troops, and there are no changes in other places.</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issues have been resolved after negotiations between China and Japan regarding the Chaoyangmen Incident and the Dagu Incident. The Hebei-East Chahar issues are still under discussion due to the more complex situation. However, the reason why the issues cannot be resolved quickly is that the Japanese side has not abandoned its claim to autonomy, so progress is difficult. There is still no solution to the East Hebei issue. Our side advocates canceling Yin Rugeng's puppet organization, but the Doihara faction on the Japanese side has not agreed, so there is still no result. In the East Chahar region, after Li Shou-hsin's puppet troops advanced to occupy six counties, they established a pseudo-temporary military government in Zhangbei and changed the county magistrates of Zhangbei, Guyuan, Kangbao, and Shangdu. The National Government recently issued a clear order to establish the Suiyuan Border Mongolian Political Council. Prince De discussed it with his subordinates on the 27th. Recently, foreigners have been coming and going frequently in Zhangbei. Song Zheyuan's return to Beiping has not been confirmed. The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council's regular meeting on the 31st was canceled because many committee members were not in Beiping. After the appointment of Ye Biliang as the deputy director of the Secretariat of the Council was announced, Ye expressed his refusal to take office and has now been re-hired as a consultant to the Council. As for the vacancy of deputy director of the Secretariat, Wang Xizhi has been appointed to fill it. According to news from diplomatic circles, Doihara is still in Tianjin. The rumor that he has flown from Tianjin to Taiyuan is a misunderstanding of another Japanese person arriving in Bing. (31st)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Discusses Rescuing the Rural Economy Rice and Wheat, Tea, and General Groups Formulated Plans The Total Rural Loans in the Province Totaled 1.01 Million</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province borders the Yangtze River and the Huai River, and the land is fertile, which is really a suitable area for agriculture. Therefore, judging from the quantity of agricultural products, it is indeed more than other provinces. Rice can produce several million piculs per year, wheat can produce several million piculs, and the tea alone produced in Qimen is worth 3 to 4 million yuan per year. Cotton, such as the Tan cotton in Dongliu and the Wei cotton in Wujiang, is famous. It is now being gradually promoted. In addition, in recent years, water conservancy construction, highway construction, and the suppression of remnants of bandits have made transportation safer and more convenient. However, in rural areas, there is still a lack of a sufficient adjustment policy for production and sales, and the invasion of foreign rice and foreign flour has greatly reduced the value of agricultural products, and the rural economy has reached the brink of collapse. Anhui Province already has a natural and fertile land and low-cost labor. If the rural economy can be adjusted, it will not be difficult to restore rural production capacity. The provincial government is now preparing to establish provincial local banks and agricultural warehouses to take on the responsibility of agricultural product storage and agency transportation and sales. Since agricultural product storage is only beneficial to farmers after the agricultural harvest, on the one hand, farmers cannot obtain the funds they need for production before the harvest, so Qingmiao loans are handled in kind, that is, seeds or soybean cakes are used as cash loans. If this can be promoted as much as possible, it will undoubtedly benefit rural finance. However, to establish universal facilities and build the entire rural economy, it still depends on overall planning to avoid deformed development. This requires technical, organizational, and financial conditions to reach this goal. The Anhui Provincial Government now deeply understands that the province's commercial city finance is based on agriculture, so it decided to invite experts from Shanghai and Wuhan and leaders from the banking industry to hold a rural economic discussion in Wuhu in order to obtain overall program instructions, experience guidance, and huge financial assistance. The meeting opened at 2:00 p.m. on January 30 at the Wuhu Provincial Local Bank. Provincial Chairman Liu Zhenhua was unable to attend due to his inspection tour of western Anhui. Civil Affairs Director Ma Lingfu, Construction Department Director Liu Yiyan, and Finance Department Director Yang Mianzhong (Secretary Zhang Yu attended on his behalf) attended with important officials and technical personnel from various departments. More than 30 leaders from the banking industry and agricultural cooperation experts from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuhan attended the meeting. After the meeting opened, Chairman Ma Lingfu gave an opening speech on behalf of Liu Zhenhua. The directors of various departments reported in detail on the political, financial, and construction of Anhui Province, as well as the production and economic conditions of rural areas in recent years, so that the experts could listen. The results of the discussion on the first day were divided into three groups: rice and wheat, tea, and general. Attendees were selected to formulate specific plans to be implemented. After the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m., each group resumed meetings at the Southeast Hotel and ended late at night. On the morning of the 31st, the meetings continued. In the afternoon, they may be completed and closed. The assigned personnel are estimated as follows: Rice and Wheat Group: Shen Zonghan, Wu Jingfu, Duan Tianjue, Zhao Lianfang, Wu Xiaoyuan, Gao Wenbo, Zou Bingwen, Hou Houpei, Zhang Xinyi. Wang Zhixin, Li Zhongchu, Hu Changling, Fang Junqiang, Zhang Yuanshan, conveners Shen Zonghan and Zhao Shufang; Tea Group: Xu Shilian, Yang Yinpu, Qian Tianhe, Wu Linbai, Shou Yicheng, Liu Yiyan, conveners Xu Shilian and Liu Yiyan; General Group: Ma Lingfu, Gong Yiquan, Hou Zhea, Mei Shengmao, Zeng Jikuan, Chen Juemin, Xu Jingyu, Cheng Zhuxin, Shou Miancheng, Hu Shiqi, Chen Zhongming, Feng Zigang, Wang Shiying, Xu Yuanru, Zeng Yu, Zhang Ziyu, conveners Zeng Jikuan. Wang Shiying,</p>
<p>Yang Xingcun, the chief inspector of the Rural Cooperation Committee, reported to the discussion on the general situation of the cooperative business in Anhui Province, saying, "The cooperative business in Anhui Province began with the agricultural loans entrusted to the China Foreign Relief Association after the great flood in the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931]. In April of the 24th year, the Rural Cooperation Committee was established, and cooperatives were established in 53 counties. Only a few counties remain unmanaged out of the 60 counties in the province, and it is expected that all will be established before March of this year. Statistics show that there are currently 2,032 societies being managed, with 160,101 members, 288,894 yuan in share capital, 87,326 yuan in funds, and 1,010,000 yuan in loans. The cooperative personnel in Anhui Province have the following five hopes for the conference: Develop the cooperative business, introduce bank funds to lend to rural areas to avoid farmers from being exploited, welcome guidance to increase agricultural production and improve technology, expand cooperative business, and use the cooperative organization to develop local production."

<h3>Ezhou Government Reorganizes Agricultural Products Marketing - Establishes Reorganization Office in Hankou -</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Ezhou Province is rich in agricultural products, with rice, wheat, cotton, hemp, miscellaneous grains, beans, tung oil, and tea being the main items. Except for rice, which is a staple food, cotton, wheat, and beans are raw materials needed by various yarn mills, flour mills, and oil mills in Wuhan. Hemp, tea, tung oil, and miscellaneous grains are also major export commodities. The natural quality is inherently excellent, but due to the lack of a complete marketing organization and the absence of fixed quality standards, coupled with unscrupulous boatmen who adulterate and mix in water, numerous malpractices have arisen, leading to a decline in reputation and an inability to meet market demands. Furthermore, inconvenient transportation and the lack of warehouse facilities allow foreign rice, wheat, and cotton to take advantage of the situation and invade our markets, causing domestic goods to be discarded and farmers to suffer. The only way to remedy this is to reorganize agricultural products, improve quality, streamline freight, and regulate supply and demand to seek cooperation between production and marketing. The provincial government authorities, following the principles of the National Economic Construction Movement proposed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, have decided to establish the "Hubei Province Agricultural Products Reorganization and Marketing Office" in Hankou. The outline of the plan and the organizational regulations have been approved by the provincial government meeting on the 31st and will be formally established in February. The main points of the plan outline are:</p>
<p>Goals: 1. Revitalize agriculture by reorganizing agricultural products with scientific methods, establishing standards, implementing grading, improving packaging, preventing adulteration, making them suitable for market needs, and promoting increased agricultural production. 2. Promote industry by seeking a connection between agriculture and industry through production and marketing cooperation, improving the quality of agricultural products to meet industrial standards, eliminating intermediate exploitation, and reducing manufacturing costs to promote industrial development. 3. Regulate consumption by seeking to regulate the supply and demand of agricultural products through production and marketing cooperation, prevent the depletion of rural funds, and promote the balance of foreign trade. 4. Streamline freight by adopting modern transportation tools, shortening transportation time, establishing security guarantees, setting up new-style warehouses, improving the organization, and facilitating marketing to streamline freight and invigorate finance.</p>
<p>Organization: 1. Establish an Agricultural Products Reorganization and Marketing Office under the Construction Department of the Hubei Provincial Government to seek cooperation between production and marketing and regulate supply and demand through administrative power. 2. The Agricultural Products Reorganization and Marketing Office may establish a design committee to seek cooperation from all parties in production and marketing. The committee will consist of nine members, with the Director of the Construction Department serving concurrently as the Chairman. The members will include the President of the Provincial Bank, the Director-General or Chief Inspector of the Rural Cooperative Association, the Deputy Director of the Cotton Adulteration Crackdown Office, the Director of the Inland River Navigation Administration, and relevant factory and business representatives.</p>
<p>Business: 1. Reorganization and grading of agricultural products, and improvement of packaging and warehousing. 2. Accepting the entrustment of various cooperative societies to act as agents for the transportation and marketing of agricultural products and agricultural supplies. 3. Accepting the entrustment of various manufacturers to act as agents for the procurement, transportation, and marketing of agricultural raw materials and products.</p>
<p>Methods: In promoting business, the principle of division of labor and cooperation will be adopted in cooperation with all parties. 1. Establishment of warehouses and handling of warehouse pledge loans and transportation remittances. 2. Crackdown on adulteration of agricultural products and formulation of grading standards. 3. Transportation of agricultural products and joint transportation with inland river navigation. 4. Insurance for the transportation and marketing of agricultural products. 5. Manufacturers entrust agents to purchase agricultural raw materials and accept products from various cooperative societies, and the office and various factories will formulate preferential measures. 6. Cooperative societies entrust agents to transport and market agricultural products, and the office and the Rural Cooperative Association will formulate measures. 7. The office will set up agricultural product reorganization sites in the location of the warehouses to supervise the reorganization, grading, and packaging of agricultural products.</p>
<p>Business Plan: In the first year, focus efforts on the Xiang River Basin. Shallow-draft steamboats will be used for transportation, and a responsible system will be adopted for transportation methods. The Provincial Bank will temporarily set up one warehouse each in Laohekou, Fancheng, and Shayang, and will handle warehouse pledge loans and transportation remittances. It is estimated that the amount of agricultural products transported from northern Hubei to Hankou each year is more than 500,000 dan of cotton, and more than 2 million dan of wheat, beans, and miscellaneous grains. The office's first-year operating budget is to transport and market 100,000 dan of cotton, 300,000 dan of wheat, beans, and miscellaneous grains, and 120,000 dan of other agricultural supplies and products, accounting for slightly less than one-quarter of the total transportation and marketing volume. Such facilities are indeed necessary at a time when agriculture, industry, and commerce are in distress. (31st)</p>
<h3>General Situation of Industry and Commerce in Anqing - No Prosperity Seen in Market Reorganization -</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anqing is located at a strategic point on the Yangtze River, but port affairs and municipal administration are undeveloped, and the nearby produce is not abundant. In recent years, it has suffered repeated floods and droughts, the market is depressed, finance is stagnant, and industry and commerce are declining day by day, so the market has not seen prosperity. The more prosperous streets are only Guohuo Street, Daobashi, Zitongge, and Science Street. The rest, such as outside the West Gate, outside the East Gate, outside the South Gate, and outside the North Gate, have been damaged. Each year, imports and exports include more than 100,000 shi of wheat on the export side, which is transshipped from nearby counties, more than 50,000 dan of cotton, more than 30,000 dan of rice, more than 100,000 baskets of eggs, as well as wood charcoal, bamboo mats, fish, Poria cocos, tea, etc. On the import side, there are cotton yarn, indigo, refined salt, Huai salt, flour, sugar, groceries, silk, summer cloth, dyes, ironware, coal, wood, medicinal materials, cigarettes, tobacco, paper, Guang goods, hardware, electrical materials, etc., with a total amount of no less than 10 million yuan. As for financial institutions, there are the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Farmers Bank, the Shanghai Bank, the Industrial Bank, and the newly organized Anhui Local Bank. However, the Shanghai Bank specializes in deposits, loans, remittances, and other businesses. The remaining Central Bank, Bank of China, Farmers Bank, and Industrial Bank all issue banknotes that circulate in the market. However, the money shop industry has been greatly affected by the economic downturn in recent years, and most of them have closed down and have never recovered. Other businesses have closed down due to poor business conditions, one after another. Now, during the Lunar New Year, there are countless people who cannot open the market, and those who勉forcefully support it account for eighty or ninety percent. In terms of industry, most of them are still old-fashioned handicrafts. Only the Provincial Electric Light Factory, the Anqing Advanced Industrial Vocational Affiliated Mechanical Factory, and a few rice mills and ginneries in rudimentary form use machinery. Handicrafts include factories attached to the official printing bureau, the First Prison, the Reformatory, and the Provincial Homeless Rehabilitation Center. The scale is small and the productivity is self-evident. Among folk handicrafts, the most important is the native cloth industry. Most of the workers in this industry are registered in Hefei. The machine shops are located in Guanyin Lane, Banjing Lane, Daxinqiao, and Xiaoxinqiao outside the West Gate. There are two types of weaving machines: wooden machines and iron machines. According to past statistics, there are more than 600 wooden machines and only more than 200 iron machines. The woven cloth is sold in cities and villages and nearby counties. There are more than 170 machine shops, more than 700 male workers, more than 70 female workers, and more than 500 child workers. In recent years, news of business failures has been heard from time to time. Others, such as paint, fireworks, waste cattle slaughtering, machine sewing, bamboo, stone, wood, tile, saw, noodle, electrical, colored tie, white iron, round wooden barrel, clothing, and barber industries, their prosperity and I are all transferred with the degree of market consumption. The tragic defeat phenomenon in recent years is also a universal fact. (January 30)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Another Robbery Case in Huan'an Township</h3>
<p>After the Wu Yunsheng family robbery case in Huan'an Township, Seventh District of Punan, remained unsolved, unexpectedly, six or seven robbers armed with rifles and carrying ladders came to the home of Wu Rongda, a farmer in the third Jia, seventh household of the first Bao, the night before. They entered the house through the upstairs window and robbed the family, forcing the victims to not make a sound and ransacking the house. The wife of the victim was beaten. Before leaving, they robbed silver dollars, clothes, rice, and other items and escaped. The police station in charge immediately sent detectives to investigate and arrest the criminals, and reported to the county government to instruct the security team soldiers to strictly arrest the criminals and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Dozens of Robbers Rob a Farmhouse</h3>
<p>Wu Tongda, a farmer in Dongzhujing Village, Waikuatang, had a well-off family. On the night of the 31st, at 11 p.m., his wife and children went to a wedding feast at the Qi family and did not return. Suddenly, more than 20 robbers came and tied Wu and his old mother, Zhu, upside down on the beams and tortured them to reveal where the silver was hidden. Then, they dug with iron rakes and robbed 1,500 silver dollars, 800 legal tender, four gold rings, three silver bracelets, and two silver chains (divided into two packages) hidden underground. The ransacking lasted for five hours. Before leaving, they fired two shots, got on a boat, and left.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Preparing to Establish Xingye Silk Company</h3>
<p>Our country's silk industry has always been a major agricultural byproduct and a major export for foreign trade. In recent years, affected by the global recession and the oppressive dumping of Japanese silk and rayon, the market has plummeted. Our country's silk sales have almost been abandoned in the world market, which is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Although we were fortunate to have a turning point last year, speculative elements have again resorted to shoddy manufacturing, only seeking temporary luck and disregarding overseas credit, resulting in dim prospects for silk sales. If we do not strive for unity and fundamentally improve, Chinese silk will never have a foothold in overseas markets. Silk industry leaders Qian Fenghao, Xue Shouhuan, Xue Runpei, and others have gathered the backbone of the silk industry to organize the Xingye Silk Co., Ltd., with a pre-determined capital of one million yuan, and will first recruit half the number of fifty yuan in order to improve the quality of raw materials, enhance silk manufacturing technology, and have hired Hua Shaochun as the preparation director, responsible for handling all ongoing matters.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Monitoring Grain Depot Staff for Malpractice</h3>
<p>All the old grain depot staff in this county committed malpractice. County Magistrate Jiang thoroughly investigated the old series and found that the shortage amounted to more than 400,000 yuan. He made a list by year and submitted it to the provincial government for review and instructions, and was ordered to strictly pursue the matter. Last night, County Magistrate Jiang specially hosted a banquet and invited all the old and new staff of the grain depot to the government office for dinner. After the meal, he summoned all the new accountants to the back hall to inquire about the details of the malpractice, and then instructed the police to monitor the staff. At the same time, he ordered the police to also guard the old staff in the grain depot, pending disposition. It is said that they must pay a sum of 100,000 yuan to regain their freedom.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Labor Service Begins Work</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Party, government, military, and academic personnel's labor service, after the Jiangsu Provincial Government handed it over to the Construction Department to draft a plan, the town and county, after receiving the order, immediately invited responsible representatives from various agencies to coordinate and decide on the implementation method. The 795th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee was approved and implemented from March 1st. The number of people working is estimated to be nearly 5,000. The work location has now been selected to dredge the moat in front of the Medical and Political College as a rowing venue. Regarding students, female students may be exempted from participation, while civil servants, including female staff, must all participate. The work date is three days for party and government personnel, excavated by groups from various agencies. It is said that military police students will work for ten days, but their continuous working date is three days, and the other seven days will be arranged by the principals of each school in their spare time under the principle of not hindering their studies. Currently, there are statistically 1,000 personnel from the provincial party and government agencies, and they are currently preparing for allocation and grouping. The remaining agencies are also successively collecting statistics.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Strict Search for Opium Offenders in All Counties of Nantong</h3>
<p>In all counties and cities of the Nantong district, a large-scale search and arrest of opium offenders was carried out simultaneously in urban and rural areas, regardless of wealth or class, and all were arrested. The number of men and women is nearly a thousand, and most of them are registered and licensed. The special commissioner believes that the prisons and detention centers in the counties are overcrowded with opium offenders, and has specially expanded the Xiaohai Town Opium People's Factory to accommodate as many convicted opium cases as possible from the counties to learn skills.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Anfu Money Shop Announces Closure</h3>
<p>Hangzhou's Jiaoren Road Anfu Money Shop has been open for more than 20 years, and its credit has been very good on weekdays. Its capital is 60,000 yuan, and its annual business reaches 1 million yuan. It has had a surplus every year. Recently, the Lunar New Year's Eve has passed, and the market is about to open. Manager Chen Gongqing is old and has no intention of operating, and because of the impact of the economic downturn, it is difficult to be sure of business. Therefore, it was decided to announce the closure. The accounts were officially closed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Apprehended the Qianliang Director Who Embezzled Funds</h3>
<p>Fan Weichen, the former director of the Qianliang Collection Office of the Yin County Government, embezzled a large amount of public funds during his tenure. His father, Fan Chun, guaranteed the debt, but failed to clear it. The county government then summoned Fan Chun to court and pressed him to pay. Later, Wu Ziying and others provided bail for him to go out and set a deadline for raising the money. Now, the county government believes that Fan Chun has been out on bail for more than a year, and the arrears have still not been raised, and has specially urged the guarantors to send Fan to court so that he can be forced to pay. Wu and others had no choice but to search for the whereabouts of Fan and his son. They soon found out that Fan Weichen was pretending to be ill and hiding in the hospital room of the central hospital on County Xue Street in this port. The county government sent personnel to arrest Fan Weichen, interrogated him, and sent him to the Yin County District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Science Miscellany Edited by the Science Society of China A Discussion on Planting Trees for Air Defense (Part 1)</h3>
<p>By Li Yingong</p>
<p>Recently, the international situation has become unpredictable, and prophets often make plans for preventing future disasters. Even our country, which loves peace so much, has been influenced by the times and has once engaged in air defense exercises. This is to show vigilance and seek self-defense, which is really unavoidable. However, in the face of imminent disasters, our country's science is backward and lacks airspace facilities, such as anti-aircraft guns and anti-gas masks. Moreover, unlike the people of various Western and Eastern countries who are proficient in industrial manufacturing, once something happens, they will immediately turn thousands of public and private factories in their territory to military use, and they are well-prepared for land and sea warfare, and air defense is not a problem. In contrast, it is not enough to compete with them. It is undeniable that we cannot sit idly by in defending against insults and seeking survival.</p>
<p>In terms of air defense, our country currently has a limited number of aircraft, which are generally only suitable for reconnaissance and expulsion. There are no underground tunnels or trams in the cities, and there are few pagodas with more than a dozen levels. The cities and fortresses are inevitably empty. The storage of firearms is too simple, which is well known to everyone. In recent years, there has been much talk about construction instead of construction, and there is no limit to the towering new yamen that look like palaces, and they are still competing to imitate them. The cost of doing one thing is often tens or even millions of national currency. In fact, there is little need, or it is completely unproductive, not to satisfy the desires of a few people to live in luxury, but to boast at the time and please people for a moment. Only then do we realize that if we are bombed one day, there is a possibility of becoming ashes, but it is too late to regret it.</p>
<p>Please allow me to speak of the importance of air defense. In the past, the world's attention was focused on material enjoyment. For example, France and Germany were famous for their art, Rome was known for its architecture, and their beautiful rivers and mountains dazzled people's eyes, making people feel endless admiration. But this is no longer the case. Since the evolution of new weapons and aviation, the so-called strong armor and sharp weapons can sometimes be disintegrated before they are even deployed, and the general trend is gone. In the shortest period of time, we will inevitably lament the ruins of cities and the suffering of the people. Therefore, the reason why modern science urges people to reflect deeply and drives the minds of general scholars to conduct in-depth research is all about military air defense. How can we not pay attention?</p>
<p>Let me further explain why planting trees can defend against air raids. Conceal buildings. The branches and leaves of tall trees rise high above the ground, reaching ten or more feet. The shadows cover a wide area, and even the crowns of a few large trees can provide protection over a long distance. Blend in with military equipment. Fortresses, trenches, and other fortifications are often targets for enemy aircraft. Planting more trees can make it difficult for enemy aircraft to scout or detect their locations, thus invisibly impeding their advance. Ambush troops. The enemy cannot easily detect our troops, and we can take shortcuts to launch an anti-aircraft artillery attack. Prevent the spread of fire. When enemy aircraft drop bombs, the bombs will first hit the tops of the trees, reducing their destructive power. In addition, many tree species have fire-resistant properties, so even if the bombs explode and ignite, the fire can be isolated and prevented from spreading. The humidity in forests is higher, and the accumulation of fallen leaves and dead branches, which form the ground cover, and the leaves and bark all have the function of absorbing poisonous gases, which can make the poisonous gases released by enemy aircraft disappear early. In addition, there are many other features related to defensive fortifications.</p>
<p>In ancient times, our country had many forests for military use that can be traced back to historical records, such as Taolin Fortress (Zuo Zhuan: Marquis Jin sent Zhan Jia to guard Xia with the Taolin Fortress, which was 400 li east of Chang'an), Songbai Fortress (Xunzi: according to the Songbai Fortress), and Yulin Fortress (Han Shu: Biography of Han Anguo: planting elms as fortresses). For example, during the Three Kingdoms period, if Cao Cao had not been hidden by the forest during the battle with Ma Chao, Cao Cao would have been captured. In modern times, when bandits were a scourge, the national army went to suppress them, and the two armies often confronted each other, and they still relied on mountains and forests to resist the enemy, which was not uncommon. From the perspective of modern world history, in 1914, after the outbreak of the European War, the reason why the German army failed to drive straight into France was clearly due to the fact that the forests blocked the sky and the smoke of war was an important reason. Our country's scholars who traveled to the East and West to study the navy and army submitted a memorial to set up fortresses on the border, but they rarely mentioned the afforestation of the troop garrison and the surrounding areas. When the sea border was in turmoil, the location of the fortresses was easily discovered by the enemy ships' long-range lights. How can the misjudgment be overcome? Looking at the old site of the artillery emplacements on Qingdao's Huiquan Mountain and Taiping Mountain, which were painstakingly managed by the Germans in the past, the environment was mostly planted with locusts, pines, and other tree species to form excellent forests that meandered and twisted, making people at a loss as to where the important points were. The fact that the Japanese did not dare to land for months during the siege in the European War clearly shows this.</p>
<p>So, in order to achieve the purpose of air defense, how should we plant trees? Please elaborate on it. (1) Choosing evergreen or fire-resistant trees is the most effective. There are many tree species in various places, and it is impossible to list them one by one in a hurry, but trees such as ginkgo, cork oak, bitter camphor, winter holly, privet, Camellia japonica, coral tree, evergreen oak, oak, and mountain tea are all appropriate choices. Other broad-leaved trees with tall trunks and branches and leaves with high water content are also good. However, use less of those with branches and leaves rich in oil and easily flammable. If it is a single, unique tree, then there is no need to be too demanding. (2) The planting distance may as well be slightly denser, which is easier to close, and in a tight environment, the height growth will be more developed, which is also a natural trend in plant physiology. (3) In sparse places, rush to plant undergrowth. Often, if you encounter fast-growing species, they will catch up with the upper-layer trees in a few years, and the crowns will still surpass them. Tree species with soft branches and elasticity are needed. Because the bombs dropped from the plane are difficult to explode when they touch it, causing bombing injuries. Bamboo is also good, especially Mao bamboo.</p>
<p>The governments of Eastern and Western countries regard forests as a major source of government revenue, and society regards forests as the most stable place for public undertaking investment. The people regard forests as a spiritual sustenance that cannot be separated for a moment. Therefore, regardless of whether it is urban or rural, except for bare rocky land that is unsuitable for forestry, they cannot bear to abandon even the barren soil layer with a little ground cover. Therefore, the warning of losing the benefit of land is not only for air defense and cover, but its benefits are greater in times of military affairs. For example, the procurement of wood for aircraft manufacturing, the supply of wood for bridges and trenches, and even all temporary uses for erecting tents and sheds for marching all have inexhaustible reserves. How can we fully describe the benefits of trees?</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Unified and Reconstruction Bonds: Unified Bonds Total 146 Million Yuan, to Redeem Public Bonds, Treasury Bills, and Certificates Issued Over the Years</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, due to rampant rumors in the public bond market, convened financial and commercial leaders, along with representatives from bondholder associations Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Song Ziliang, Chen Guangfu, and others, at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon for discussions. Minister Kong stated that since the implementation of the new currency policy, the market has been relatively stable, and last month's customs revenue surpassed the 60-year record, resulting in a trade surplus. However, revenue shortfalls are making public finances increasingly difficult, which will also affect various bond funds. To revive the economy, regulate finance, and maintain bond credit, it is essential to deliberate on appropriate measures for relief. The attendees jointly studied and supported the government's overall economic recovery policy and the consolidation of bond credit through the reconstruction bonds. One purpose is to exchange old bonds, and the other is to strengthen financial organization and support production and construction. The bondholder association also issued a declaration of support. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>As of the end of January this year, the government's outstanding domestic public bonds, treasury bills, and certificates issued over the years totaled over 146 million yuan. The monthly payment of principal and interest funds amounts to more than 15 million yuan. In recent years, the national crisis has been severe, no less than in the past. Furthermore, frequent natural disasters and banditry internally, coupled with the fluctuations of the global economic panic externally, and the impact of rising silver prices, have led to the desolation of rural areas, stagnation of industry and commerce, and the decline of all sectors, plunging the national finance into a state of collapse. The government's various tax revenues have declined significantly. Customs duties, which serve as the principal and interest fund for bonds, have experienced substantial shortfalls due to the loss of overall purchasing power in society. According to reliable investigations, customs duties have consistently fallen short of revenue targets each month since July of last year. After allocating funds for foreign debts and indemnities, the average monthly shortfall in domestic debt principal and interest funds is 4 million yuan, which the government has temporarily advanced in full each month to ensure timely repayment of principal and interest, maintaining the credit of national debt. The government's dedication to upholding this commitment amidst extreme financial difficulties is truly commendable, and bondholders have greatly benefited from the focus on maintaining bond credit. Last year, the government implemented the legal tender policy to achieve economic recovery through self-reliance. If, following Minister Kong's declaration of November 4th of last year, the government can proceed with the completion of legal tender implementation, the strengthening of financial organization, the support of production and construction, and the balancing of national treasury revenues and expenditures, then we shall see the overall and balanced development of the social economy. The benefits that society will receive in the future will be countless. As citizens, mindful of our responsibility, we should work together with one heart and one mind to support the success of legal tender, stabilize finance, invigorate the market, and assist the government in balancing revenue and expenditure, so that it has the resources to engage in major construction plans to preserve our nation's survival, restore idle capital to productive enterprises, reduce trade deficits, and resolve the suffering of the entire population, achieving the goal of benefiting the country and its people. Moreover, given the severity of the national crisis, the people should strive to support the government. The more strength the government has, the less burden the people will bear, and the more efficient the national survival will be. The principle is clear, and we should all be keenly aware of this.</p>
<p>Now, the bondholder association and the government have jointly studied that the amount of customs revenue is sufficient to cover the funds that should be allocated for this case, so that bondholders can maintain stable long-term benefits, and the government's overall economic recovery policy can be completed. The detailed measures are as follows:</p>
<p>As of the end of January this year, the government's outstanding domestic public bonds, treasury bills, and certificates issued over the years totaled over 146 million yuan, with more than 30 different types, with varying maturities. The principal and interest on treasury bills and certificates are collected monthly, with odd amounts, which is not only difficult to calculate but also inconvenient for bondholders in remote provinces to collect. Unified bonds should be issued, and each bond should be exchanged for a unified bond of the same amount based on the actual debt amount of the old bonds to settle the debt. However, the Post-War Short-Term Public Bonds will mature at the end of March this year, with not much remaining. The 17th Year Long-Term Financial Public Bonds originally had a low interest rate and a long maturity. The Haihe Public Bonds have designated surtaxes as a fund. These three types of public bonds should be handled according to the original plan.</p>
<p>The total amount of unified bonds is 146 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and the repayment period is divided into five categories: Type A bonds are repaid within 12 years, Type B bonds are repaid within 15 years, Type C bonds are repaid within 18 years, Type D bonds are repaid within 21 years, and Type E bonds are repaid within 24 years. The above five types of bonds will each be drawn by lot every six months for principal and interest repayment.</p>
<p>Various old bonds will be divided into five categories according to their original maturity, and unified bonds will be exchanged as follows: A. The 22nd Patriotic Treasury Bills, Short-Term Treasury Certificates, 18th Year Customs Treasury Bills, 22nd Year North China War Zone Public Bonds, Security Bonds, 19th Year Customs Treasury Bills, and other bonds will be exchanged for Type A bonds.</p>
<p>B. The 19th Year Post-War Treasury Bills, 24th Year Treasury Bills, 24th Year Restructuring Sichuan Financial Treasury Bills, 23rd Year Customs Treasury Bills, 20th Year Cigarette Tax Treasury Bills, and other bonds will be exchanged for Type B bonds.</p>
<p>C. The 18th Year Disbandment Treasury Bills, 20th Year Consolidated Tax Treasury Bills, 30th Year Financial Short-Term Public Bonds, 20th Year Salt Tax Treasury Bills, 20th Year Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds, 18th Year Disaster Relief Public Bonds, Military Supplies Public Bonds, 18th Year Troop Reduction Public Bonds, 20th Year Customs Treasury Bills, and other bonds will be exchanged for Type C bonds.</p>
<p>D. The 19th Year Customs Public Bonds, 7-Year 6% Public Bonds, 20th Year Disaster Relief Public Bonds, Italian Boxer Indemnity Certificates, 24th Year Financial Public Bonds, 23rd Year Customs Public Bonds, Russian Indemnity Certificates, Consolidated Tax Certificates, and other bonds will be exchanged for Type D bonds.</p>
<p>E. The 22nd Year Customs Treasury Bills, 24th Year Yongzai Reconstruction Public Bonds, Restructuring 7% Public Bonds, Restructuring 6% Public Bonds, 15th Year Spring Festival Treasury Bills, and other bonds will be exchanged for Type E bonds.</p>
<p>The unified bonds will be issued on February 1st of this year, and the exchange of new and old bonds should be completed within four months.</p>
<p>In order to complete the legal tender policy, strengthen financial organization, support production and construction, balance national treasury revenues and expenditures, and allocate funds for stabilizing the bond market, reconstruction bonds totaling 340 million yuan will be issued on February 1st of this year, with an annual interest rate of 6% and a term of 24 years. Principal and interest will be drawn by lot every six months for repayment.</p>
<p>The principal and interest repayment funds for the unified bonds and reconstruction bonds will continue to be allocated from customs duties as stipulated in the original plan for the old bonds. After deducting foreign debts and indemnities, the remaining tax revenues and the originally mortgaged portion of refunded indemnities will be used for payment. The Ministry of Finance will order the Inspector General of Customs to allocate an average monthly amount to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for storage and payment.</p>
<p>The above measures are very sound, fulfilling the national duty of patriotism and ensuring long-term stability of personal interests. What is called benefiting the country and its people lies entirely herein. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>Due to many practical difficulties in the Ministry's order for cash delivery, the brokers' association is discussing remedies but has not yet made a decision, according to the New Sound News Agency. Since the Ministry of Finance dispatched Xu Zhizhu and others to supervise the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange in handling the securities settlement for January and limited trading in February, requiring all sellers to provide the actual securities in full, the brokers' association convened a meeting to discuss remedies. Securities trading was suspended yesterday as a result. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Securities Trading Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to many practical difficulties in the Ministry's order for cash delivery, the brokers' association is discussing remedies but has not yet made a decision.</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance dispatched Xu Zhizhu and others to supervise the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange in handling the securities settlement for January and limited trading in February, requiring all sellers to provide the actual securities in full, the brokers' association convened a meeting to discuss remedies. Securities trading was suspended yesterday as a result. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Trading Suspended Yesterday: The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange suspended trading on January 30th and 31st. After the Ministry of Finance prohibited brokers from settling transactions privately and dispatched officials to supervise the settlement of transactions for January, the process has been completed. Trading was originally scheduled to resume as usual yesterday. In accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order, regardless of new or old transactions, all sellers were required to provide the actual securities in full, to be inspected and sealed by exchange supervisors, the board of directors, the brokers' association, and the Central Trust Bureau, and then deposited with the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping. However, due to practical problems in providing the actual securities, trading could not resume yesterday. Today, as it is Sunday, trading is suspended as usual.</p>
<p>Meeting to Discuss Remedies: The brokers' association of the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange held a meeting of brokers yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, chaired by He Peiyuan, to discuss the Ministry of Finance's order requiring all sellers to provide the actual securities in full. After a lengthy discussion, no decision was reached. Another meeting was held at 8 PM. However, regarding the cash delivery issue, it was recognized that there were many practical difficulties, and it was proposed to request the Ministry of Finance to understand the difficulties and withdraw the order. It is said that securities trading may resume as usual on Monday.</p>
<p>Check Clearing: The bank clearing house increased the number of check clearings to four on the day before yesterday due to securities trading. The total amount of cleared checks reached a substantial 184.94 million yuan. As for yesterday's total clearing amount, it was 40.068 million yuan, 32 yuan and 3 jiao, of which 3.686718 million yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen was collected on behalf of money shops, and 1.929325 million yuan and 1 jiao and 1 fen for others. There was also an increase compared to usual.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Stock Exchange to Postpone Opening</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday ordered the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange: "Upon investigation of the recent trading situation at the exchange, the types and quantities of transactions by each broker, and whether there is any speculation or manipulation, the ministry is currently dispatching officials to conduct a thorough investigation. Before the investigation is fully completed, the exchange should immediately postpone opening. You are hereby ordered to comply and notify all brokers to comply accordingly." This order was also sent to the supervisor of the Shanghai Stock Exchange: "Upon investigation of the recent trading situation at the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, the types and quantities of transactions by each broker, and whether there is any speculation or manipulation, the official is currently conducting a thorough investigation together with officials dispatched by the ministry. Before the investigation is fully completed, the exchange should immediately postpone opening. In addition to instructing the exchange to comply, you are hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Sincerely Promote Domestic Goods, Correcting Customer Psychology with Perseverance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all industries yesterday to promote domestic goods: "We are writing to inform you that on the 31st of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Year Movement stating that the past National Goods Year, Women's National Goods Year, and Students' National Goods Year have not achieved much success. This year's Citizens' National Goods Year is a comprehensive movement for the citizens of Shanghai. Learning from past mistakes, it is believed that most citizens blindly follow and are passive. If shops can promote more domestic goods and have more opportunities to connect with citizens, then citizens will readily purchase domestic goods. This is a fundamental way to promote domestic goods. We hereby request your association to forward this letter to all trade associations, urging members to promote domestic goods across the board to show their support and encouragement. The citizens will be fortunate, and the domestic goods will be fortunate." The association believes that sellers are the intermediary between consumers, but in other words, they can be said to be the linchpin of consumers. If sellers can change their perspective and regard promoting domestic goods as their duty, consumers themselves may not be able to directly purchase from foreign merchants, and will switch to using domestic goods because imported goods are not easy to find. Over time, this will become a habit. Therefore, the responsibility of sellers today should not be to speculate on customer psychology with a superficial eye, but to correct customer psychology with perseverance. If our business community ignores this responsibility, it is tantamount to abandoning their national duty, and it is disloyal to the country. We hereby send another letter of earnest persuasion, hoping that your association will forward a letter to all affiliated trade associations, urging them to act with sincerity and handle the matter conscientiously."</p>
<h3>Telegrams from All Sectors Welcome Hu, Mr. Hu Responds to Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>In addition to appointing Qian Longzhang, Gong Shisong, Liu Renfu, and others to participate in the welcoming Hu conference, the Chinese Western Medicine Association also sent a welcoming telegram yesterday: "Guangzhou, Chairman Hu Zhantang: The country is in danger, and strong neighbors are pressing in. Reviving the country depends on the wise. We eagerly await your arrival in the capital to share the burden. We look forward to your arrival with great anticipation. We hereby send this telegram to welcome you. Sincerely, the Chinese Western Medicine Association and the Western Medicine Associations of Nanjing, Fuyang, Zhenjiang, Jiaxing, Hangxian, Wenzhou, Jiangdu, Chongming, Changzhou, Shaoxian, Lianshui, Sudong, Chao'an, Shantou, Suzhou, Jurong, Haimen, Taixing, Huangyan, Jinhua, Changshu, Shashi, Yancheng, Tianjin, Huaiyin, Shanghai, and other twenty-six locations."</p>
<p>Chairman Hu telegraphed back to the preparatory committee yesterday as follows: "To the preparatory committee of all sectors in Shanghai welcoming Chairman Hu to take office in Beijing: Having received both telegrams, I am deeply grateful for your attention. Since arriving in Guangzhou, Hanmin has been feeling slightly unwell due to a cold and needs to rest for a while. The date of my trip north will be announced later. First, I respond and thank you for your kindness. Hu Hanmin."</p>

<h3>Xu Chongzhi Returns North, Arriving Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Xu Chongzhi, Vice President of the Control Yuan, went south to welcome Chairman Hu. After staying in Shanghai for a short time, he originally intended to travel north with Mr. Hu on the same ship this morning. However, as Mr. Hu is feeling slightly unwell in Guangdong, the departure date has been postponed. Therefore, Mr. Xu took the Dollar Company's President Jackson ship and departed from Hong Kong to return north. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 3rd. Mr. Hu will also leave Guangdong for Hong Kong within days and travel north by mail ship. However, the exact date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Construction of Central Machine and Other Three Factories Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>The construction of the Central Machine, Steelmaking, and Ironmaking factories built by the Ministry of Industries in Beixinjing, Zhenbei Road, in this city, which has been undertaken by the Tailai Construction Company for the past two years, has been progressing rapidly. Currently, the steel frames of each factory have been erected, and the walls and windows of the machine factory have also been completed. However, the corrugated iron roofing ordered by the Ministry of Industries from the United Kingdom has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. Once it arrives, the roofing can be completed in three weeks. Two-thirds of all the machinery for each factory has been transported to the factory site and will be installed after the factory buildings are completed. As for the pipe factory, bids were opened during Chen Gongbo's tenure as Minister of Industries. However, because the bids from various construction companies vary in whether they include iron or not, the bid values could not be immediately determined. Therefore, it has not yet been decided which company will undertake the construction. The area of the pipe factory is more than three times the size of the machine, steelmaking, and ironmaking factories, with a construction cost of approximately 300,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Land Bureau's Newly Revised Regulations Compilation</h3>
<p>Since Director Cai took office at the Municipal Land Bureau, he has been earnestly rectifying land affairs. The accumulated cases from the past have been cleared by extending office hours until 9 PM. Furthermore, various regulations have been issued and improved upon in order to streamline procedures while simultaneously promoting financial flow and easing the burden of payment for the city's residents. These matters have been reported in previous issues. Now, it is reported that the bureau believes that its revised regulations are highly relevant to the property rights of the people, and it fears that the various businesses in the city may not be fully aware of them. Therefore, it is issuing another compilation of announcements. Regarding making real estate utilization flexible, promoting financial flow, and revitalizing the market, the following measures are being taken: (1) A draft of temporary regulations for land certificate mortgages has been submitted to the Municipal Government, which in turn forwarded it to the Executive Yuan. Regarding the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 493, which stipulates that foreclosures must be based on a final court judgment, a request has been made for a reinterpretation. (2) A request has been submitted to the Ministry, asking them to instruct the Shanghai money houses and banks to treat land certificate mortgages as having the same validity as perpetual leases. The Municipal Government has been informed that the Ministry of Finance has approved this request. (3) A request has been submitted to the Ministry, asking them to instruct the Shanghai Bankers Association to amend the cash collateral method to include real estate outside the concessions as collateral, and to avoid any discrimination in implementation. The Municipal Government has issued an order instructing the Ministry of Finance to handle the matter accordingly. (4) A request has been submitted to the Ministry to add land certificates or deeds as collateral when exchanging for legal tender, in order to increase the credibility of the legal tender. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has unanimously supported this proposal, and a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for adoption, which has been favorably responded to. The compilation of announcements is also included below so that the people of this city who own real estate have something to follow.</p>
<p>Announcement</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Announcement (No. 20): It is announced that the existing regulations of this bureau have been reviewed and revised to address areas needing improvement or rectification. These revisions have been submitted and announced individually. However, due to the importance of these regulations to property owners and the reduction of fees, as well as the time-sensitive nature of some regulations, it is feared that property owners may not be fully aware of them. Therefore, these regulations are being announced together to ensure that every household is informed and that implementation is facilitated. All are expected to comply. This announcement is hereby made on February 1, 1936, by Cai Zengji, Acting Director.</p>
<p>Regulations</p>
<p>Details are as follows: (1) Establishment of an Inquiry Office: To facilitate public understanding of the bureau's various operations, an inquiry office has been established (at the bureau's entrance). Nine rules have been drafted, and bureau staff will be assigned to answer public inquiries. (2) Return of Original Deeds When Exchanging Certificates: When exchanging certificates, if people need to retrieve their original deeds, they can submit a film copy. People exchanging certificates who submit their original deeds or other important evidence and do not wish to leave them at the bureau can have their deeds photographed at the bureau's deed photography section. After the bureau verifies the conformity, the documents will be numbered, stamped, and returned. When claiming the certificate in the future, the original documents must be returned for cancellation. (3) Procedure for Submitting Grain Certificates for Ordinary Certificate Exchange: When exchanging certificates, it is necessary to submit grain certificates for the most recent three years. However, many property owners often lose their grain certificates from previous years, hindering the certificate exchange process. Therefore, for ordinary certificate exchange cases, the requirement is changed to the most recent year. However, if it is a replacement for a lost certificate, the three-year requirement still applies. (4) For Important Cases Involving Property Rights and Disputes, a Guarantor's Seal and a Signature Must Be Included in the Petition: In important cases involving claims to property rights and resolution of disputes, the names of the petitioners, a cross mark, or a signature often do not match, which may cause confusion. Therefore, on December 14, 1935, an announcement was made that for the aforementioned requests, a guarantor's seal and the petitioner's signature must be included in the first petition. Future submissions or claim of documents at the conclusion of the case must be based on this. (5) Handling of Accumulated Cases and Extension of Office Hours: The bureau has found approximately 10,000 pending cases regarding tax assessments, land requisitions, perpetual lease lands, boundary disputes, and deed review registration. These cases urgently need to be cleared. Therefore, from December 16, 1935, the bureau has been handling accumulated cases from 6 PM to 9 PM daily. The certificate issuance and fee collection sections will extend their hours from 6 PM to 8 PM. From 8 PM to 9 PM will be the time for closing accounts. On Saturdays, the extension is until 5 PM. On Sundays, it is from 1 PM to 9 PM. It is currently planned to clear all accumulated cases within three months. (6) Tax Reduction for Supplemental Payment of Old Deed Taxes: For sales of old single-deed plots, deed tax should be paid within three months from the date of the deed. A late fee will be charged for overdue payments. To reduce the burden on the people, late fees will be waived for overdue deeds, and the original tax amount will be reduced accordingly. A method was announced on December 14, 1935, temporarily limited to three months. Overdue payments will still be taxed in full according to regulations. (7) Deadline for Claiming Land Certificates; Storage Fee for Overdue Certificates: The bureau has been issuing an increasing number of certificates and maps. Some property owners have long approved the maps and had their certificates prepared, but have not claimed them for years. There are over 10,000 accumulated certificates. An announcement was made on December 31, 1935, and notifications were published in newspapers from January 7 to 9, 1936, dividing the city into districts and households, setting a deadline of the end of February 1936 to claim the certificates. A storage fee will be charged for overdue certificates, ranging from 50 cents to 2 yuan, which will be collected when the certificates are claimed in the future. (8) Old Deed Mortgages: Deadline for Certificate Exchange at the Bureau: If disputes arise from old deed mortgages, requests to the bureau to stop transfers are generally not accepted. To encourage certificate exchange and registration, the bureau announced on December 30, 1935, that within three months, regardless of whether the map has been issued, if there are old deed mortgages, both parties should come to the bureau to exchange certificates or request a survey and exchange certificates, and simultaneously apply for land certificate mortgage registration. After the deadline, the bureau will not accept any disputes or requests to stop certificate issuance and transfers. Those who have previously submitted requests to stop certificate issuance to the bureau should pay the registration fee according to the mortgage registration fee amount. (9) Measures for Clearing Excess Land and Upgrading Grades: Methods for Paying for Cases Already Handled but Not Closed: Since the land survey, many cases of excess land have been discovered in this city. For all cases of excess land and special grade upgrades for lands along Binjiang Road with Departmental approval, after the bureau's notification, those who have not come to the bureau to pay and exchange certificates total more than 1,300 cases. The bureau has drafted measures for clearing excess land and upgrading grades for cases already handled but not closed, and measures for clearing cases of land along Binjiang Road with Departmental approval that have been handled but not paid for, and announced them on December 30, 1935. For all cases where property owners have excess land or special grade upgrades for lands along Binjiang Road with Departmental approval, and the bureau has notified them before October 18, 1935, those who pay the upgrade fees in full within three months from the date of the announcement will be given a discount based on the original amount due. Those who are truly unable to pay can pay in installments over several years. (10) Improving the Regulations and Procedures for Excess Land and Grade Upgrades: The standards for handling excess land in this city were previously drafted by the bureau and approved for announcement. However, because the standards included a provision that those who have excess land or occupied land of less than one-third of a mu and are unable to pay may be temporarily allowed to use it, all property owners have requested to follow this precedent, and only a few are able to pay the fees. As a result, the city treasury's income has decreased, and property owners' property rights have not been fully established, which is not appropriate. Therefore, the bureau has drafted thirteen articles of the regulations for excess land and grade upgrades, as well as various upgrade procedures, and announced them on January 15, 1936. From now on, excess land and grade upgrades will be handled according to these regulations, and the previously established standards for handling excess land should be abolished immediately. (11) Reducing Transfer Tax: The previous transfer tax collection amount was 6 yuan per 100 yuan of the deed price for sale deeds, plus a 2 yuan special construction donation. For pawn deeds, the amount was halved. The public often finds this unbearable. After the sale is completed, they often hide and do not pay the tax, and overdue fees are even more burdensome. The bureau has already reduced the old deed tax amount, and will also reduce the current transfer tax amount to be more equitable. An announcement was made on January 15. This reduction in tax amount is limited to transfers and deeds established after the announcement, and a temporary trial period of one year is set to observe the results.</p>

<h3>Western-Clad Youth Zhao Junming Stabs Young Woman to Death: Bloodbath in Anshang Hotel; Sleeping Together Silently; Victim Suffers a Total of Nine Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>Anshang Hotel, located at 35-7 Baliqiao Road, French Concession, also known as West New Bridge Street, is solely owned by Sun Baofa (33 years old, from Wuxi). It is a mid-range establishment with decent business. Yesterday at 1 AM, a young man in Western attire and a young woman of similar age checked into the hotel. The receptionist led them to room 45 on the third floor. The young man registered under the name Zhao Junming, 28 years old, businessman. The young woman only gave the surname Zhu, with no further details about age or origin. Both of them spoke in local dialects. After settling into the room and paying the room fee, the tea boy delivered tea and water. The man and woman then closed the door and went to sleep. Yesterday at 1 PM, the man got up and asked the tea boy to buy snacks, which were delivered to the room. At 4 PM, the man left the hotel alone, paying the tea boy one dollar in advance for the room, saying that he would keep the room for another night. He then strode away. At that time, tea boy Chen Jinyu (30 years old, from Yangzhou) entered room 45 to tidy up. He found that the bedding was covered in fresh blood, and the young woman was lying motionless in the bed. The curtain was lifted, and a pungent smell of blood filled the air. He was greatly alarmed and immediately went downstairs to inform the accounting room. He gathered the tea boys and went back to the room to check. The young woman had been stabbed to death. Upon inspecting her body under the blanket, she was found naked. A sharp dagger was left on the bed. He immediately reported the incident to the Mailan Police Station. Inspector Zhang Ziying immediately dispatched patrolmen and Western detectives to investigate. The deceased was nearly 30 years old, with short hair and unbound feet. She wore a gold ring on each of her fingers. There were a total of nine stab wounds on her body: one each on the throat and below, three on the left neck and shoulder, one below the left cheek, one on the right neck, one on the right front of the forehead, and one near the sternum below the right breast. The wounds were of varying depths, about two fen in length. The bedding was stained with blood. The green plaid Indian soft satin-lined qipao, the red foreign plaid cotton-padded qipao, and the short jacket and trousers she had worn were piled to one side. The detectives inquired with the guests in the rooms on either side, who all claimed that the deceased and the man who had fled made no noise in the room. They did not know when the deceased was stabbed to death. The French Police Department ordered the photography team to rush to the scene and take photographs using flash. They then notified the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to send workers to transport the body to the morgue. The murder weapon, the deceased's belongings, clothing, and gold rings were taken back to the police station. The case will be reported to the Special No. 2 Court tomorrow, and personnel will be dispatched for inspection. The police station has issued a warrant for the arrest of the fleeing suspect Zhao Junming and will investigate the case once he is apprehended.</p>

<h3>A Large-Scale Fire Brigade to Be Built in Zhabei: Temporary Station to Be Built First; Construction to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>Since the municipal government approved the construction of a fire brigade in the city center, the Zhabei District Fire Brigade Federation has been responsible for raising funds since January 1 of this year. The total cost is 140,000 yuan, and it has been decided to build a temporary station first. The architectural plan for the entire fire station is extremely grand. The fire station will have a large auditorium, a fire engine room (each row can accommodate seven fire engines), a fire lookout tower, a repair workshop, a training ground, an office, and other facilities. It is also planned to purchase two of the largest fire pumper trucks (with a water output of 300 to 500 gallons), one fire ladder truck, one hose truck, and one ambulance. The architectural styles of both the entire fire station and the temporary station will be palace-style. Once the entire fire station is completed, it will be the largest fire department in this city. However, the construction will inevitably be delayed due to the difficulty in raising funds in a short period of time. The association is currently actively preparing to build the temporary station, which is scheduled to begin construction in March or April and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Purchasing firefighting equipment is also not easy to prepare in a short time, so it has been decided to purchase one fire pumper truck first.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice Instructs All Courts to Clear Pending Cases by a Deadline: Reduce the Burden of Litigation on the People</h3>
<p>The courts in this city received an instruction yesterday from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which reads: "It is imperative that courts handle litigation cases expeditiously and efficiently. Although there may be legal reasons or other special circumstances that cause civil cases to be delayed by more than three months and criminal cases to exceed the prescribed trial period, cases should not be arbitrarily accumulated, causing a burden on the people. Recently, a review of the case receipt and closure reports for October 1935 from various courts revealed that while many courts had a balance between receipts and closures or even closed more cases than they received, the number of accumulated pending cases remained very high. If this continues, there will be a risk of not being able to clear the backlog. In the future, courts with no pending cases must balance receipts and closures each month. If there are pending cases, the number of cases closed each month must exceed the number received. The methods prescribed in Instruction No. 5791 of November 16, 1935, must still be followed to clear all pending cases within six months. The personnel handling the cases should each work hard and be truly responsible. The supervising officials should also carefully review and strictly supervise the judicial organs under their jurisdiction. The Ministry will use the monthly case receipt and closure reports and the timely clearance of pending cases as a basis for evaluation and performance assessment. This order is issued for compliance and for transmission to all subordinate units for compliance."</p>

They each pulled out guns and threatened the family into silence. The thieves robbed them of more than 500 yuan in cash, three large silver ingots, five small silver ingots, one gold ruby ring, one teal jade ring, and one fox fur coat. After obtaining the stolen goods, the thieves fled to the northwest. The victim reported the incident to the Wenmiao Road Police Station and requested an investigation.

<h3>Suddenly Meeting Someone Who Seems Familiar: It Turns Out to Be a Robber; Robbery Case Cracked in Qinglian Street; Man in Western Attire Flees Over Rooftops</h3>
<p>Zhou Yuxin, a doctor residing at No. 11, Hengyu Lane, Qinglian Street, in the city, had his home broken into by five thieves on January 27. The thieves robbed him of several hundred yuan in banknotes, eight gold buttons, and one gold ring inlaid with pearls. He had filed a report with the police station in charge of the area requesting an investigation. At 5 PM the day before yesterday, Dr. Zhou happened to be meeting a friend at the Yuxin Teahouse at No. 19, Jiumu Di when he suddenly saw a man in Western attire who seemed familiar. As he was focusing on trying to remember the man's name, the man noticed and went downstairs. Zhou immediately followed him to No. 234, Dajing Road. The man went inside, and Zhou then remembered that he was one of the robbers from the previous robbery. He immediately reported the incident to the Xiaobeimen Police Station. Inspector Wen Shui led a team of detectives and accompanied Zhou to the house to arrest the man. However, the thief had already sensed something and fled over the rooftops. Only the thief's accomplices Zhang Fuyuan, his mistress Wu Zhao, and her aunt Wu Chen were apprehended and taken to the Laobeimen Police Station. As the search for the remaining thieves continues, no further information will be released at this time. Later that evening, two more thieves, Chen Fuchang (the one who was carrying the gun as a lookout) and Zhou Yunfa, were apprehended. After a detailed interrogation by Director Shen, but since the stolen goods have not yet been recovered, it was decided to send the five thieves, male and female, to the police station for handling.</p>
<h3>The Beifu Ship Rescued by a British Warship</h3>
<p>The Northern Company's Beifu ship, which was transporting coal from Tianjin to the Yangtze River, ran aground for the first time near Anqing on January 13. After being rescued, it ran aground again on January 19, upstream of Nanjing. Repeated attempts to tow it were unsuccessful. Later, a barge was sent from Shanghai to completely unload the coal from the ship. Then, towing was attempted again. Only yesterday did the ship report by telegram that it had been rescued by the British gunboat Ladybird, which was passing by on the Yangtze River. The ship was towed out during high tide yesterday and is now moored in Jiujiang. However, the ship's anchor has been lost.</p>
<h3>Two Companies Win Bids to Contract for Loading and Unloading Crushed Stone on Two Railway Lines; Tianjin Lida and Nanji Second Bureau Win Bids; Contract Signing Currently Underway</h3>
<p>A Shishi News Agency report states that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus require a large quantity of ballast stone for the construction of the Nanjing Yaohuamen to Honghuadi connection line and the Sujia Road. A portion of this stone has already been ordered from Qixia Mountain in Nanjing. However, the railway bureau must transport these stone chips themselves. Therefore, a public notice was issued to solicit bids for the loading and unloading of these stone chips. After the bidding process, Tianjin Lida and Nanji Second Bureau submitted the lowest bids. The engineering and materials departments jointly submitted a request to the railway bureau, which was approved and awarded to these companies. The formalities for signing the contract are currently being processed.</p>
<h3>Man Who Threatened Feng Ya Er Nu Found Guilty; Xue Qiyuan Sentenced to Nine Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xue Qiyuan, Chai Yiqing, and Zha Yiyuan, all from Ningbo, previously used threats to extort fifteen dollars and a gold watch worth one hundred and fourteen dollars from Zheng Daozhi, also from Ningbo, due to a dispute over their friend Wang Yaoxiang's relationship with Feng Ya Er Nu, a prostitute from a brothel. Zheng reported the incident to the Lao Zha gate police station, who instructed detective Song Wenqing to arrest Xue and his accomplices. The case was then transferred to the First Special Court for investigation and detention, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Feng of the First Special Court, presiding over the First Criminal Division, sentenced Xue to nine months imprisonment. Chai and Zha were found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Feng Yulin Indicted for Seducing a Young Girl; Investigation Clear, Public Prosecution According to Law</h3>
<p>Feng Yulin (23 years old, from Yancheng), residing at No. 876 Changan Road, Zhabei, worked with Lu Chen's daughter, Miaocui (16 years old), in the Yong'an Third Cotton Mill. They became acquainted, and on July 16th of the previous year, they went to a hotel room for a three-night rendezvous. Feng further planned to take Miaocui to a rented house on Rue Robert, intending to live together. However, Lu Miaocui seized an opportunity to escape and return home. Undeterred, Feng Yulin, infatuated, repeatedly sent threatening letters (stating that if she did not comply, he would resort to murder). On the night of January 6th of this year, he went to Lu Chen's home, knocked on the door, and attempted to commit indecent acts. Lu Chen and her daughter, in a state of panic and fearing for their safety, called the police, who arrested Feng Yulin and transferred him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and detention. Prosecutor Li Fen's investigation revealed clear evidence that the defendant had violated Article 241, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated according to the law, and a public trial is expected soon.</p>
<h3>Chen Fuchu; Handgun Found Concealed in Trousers</h3>
<p>Inspector Jiang Futian and detective Lu Zhulin of the French Concession police station received a tip-off on the afternoon of the 31st of last month, stating that bandits were hiding at No. 185 Route LaFayette. At 5:15 PM, they led detectives Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshu, and others to the address. They arrested Chen Fuchu (22 years old, local) in the back room of the second floor. A Browning handgun and five bullets were found concealed in his trousers. Chen also confessed to having an accomplice, Zhou Xingsheng (23 years old, local, practicing traditional Chinese medicine), residing at No. 69 Nanyang Lane, Seymour Road in the International Settlement. The detectives then took Chen back to the police station for detention and, in conjunction with the Jing'an Temple police station, dispatched detectives to arrest Zhou Xingsheng. Yesterday, they were brought before Judge Li Changnian of the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for preliminary interrogation. The police department's lawyer requested an extension for further investigation and requested a trial. The detectives then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the two defendants and presented the gun and bullets as evidence. Chen Fuchu confessed that the handgun was given to him by Zhou Xingsheng's elder brother, Zhou Baosheng, for the purpose of robbing a wealthy household. Zhou Xingsheng stated that Zhou Baosheng was not his elder brother but a classmate and denied any knowledge of the handgun. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered a postponement of the trial for seven days and remanded the defendants in custody.</p>

<h3>Public Bus; Suit Filed in Death of Patrolman in Traffic Accident</h3>
<p>Hua Bu Fan Lianfu of the French Concession Songshan Road Police Station, after finishing his shift at around 4:00 PM on the 20th of last month, was riding his bicycle home. While passing the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Haig, a Route 9 public bus, number 1511, driven by Bai Jinquan, sped towards him, attempting to overtake Fan's bicycle.

<p>Shen Zengyao (45 years old, from Shaoxing) has been working at the Yuda Transport Company on Dongting Mountain Street in the Nanshi district. Five years ago, Shen Zengyao accompanied guests to the brothels in the Beili district, where he met a prostitute named Xu (27 years old, from Taicang). They fell in love at first sight. Soon, Shen bought Xu's freedom and took her as his concubine, building a "golden house" for her at No. 17 Shachang Street. Their affection was unwavering, and they had a son and a daughter in consecutive years. The daughter is four years old, and the son is only three. Two years ago, they opened a fruit store at No. 17 to increase their income, with Xu managing everything. Their life was considered to be quite good. Unexpectedly, Xu's behavior recently changed, and she often expressed dissatisfaction, indicating that she wanted to divorce Shen Zengyao. Shen did not take it seriously. However, at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Shen Xu secretly swallowed opium. Soon after, she groaned in bed. Shen discovered this and immediately sent her to the Nanyang Hospital in Xiaodongmen for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 11:00 PM that night. Yesterday afternoon, Shen Zengyao and Lu Yongde, the local headman of the 16th pier, went to the District Court Prosecutor's Office to request an autopsy.</p>

According to her, "I am from Binjiang County, Jilin. I lost my mother at birth and lived with my father and brothers. I studied at home for three years. Unfortunately, misfortune began to befall me. My father died during the Sino-Russian War, and my brother died in battle during the September 18th Incident. At that time, I was about to enroll in Kun Guang Girls' High School in Liaoning. While processing the admission procedures, the September 18th Incident occurred. I fled to Beiping, and for the past few years, I have been making a living by babysitting. I have been drifting around ever since, lonely and helpless, suffering both physically and mentally. I have no food during the day and no place to sleep at night. I remember that I have a cousin, Xu Wenxiu, whose husband, Li Jianwen, used to live on Avenue Joffre in Shanghai. Her husband used to work at the Jilin Customs. I pawned my clothes and came to Shanghai with great difficulty. After arriving in Shanghai, I am unfamiliar with the place and have no relatives. I have no news of my cousin. It has been over ten days now, and my financial situation has reached its limit. Looking back, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I have even considered suicide, but I feel that suicide is a sign of weakness. Today, I am truly desperate and came here to seek relief." Kind-hearted people who know the address of Xu Wenxiu and Li Jianwen mentioned above are requested to report to the Chinese Women's Temperance Association at No. 206 Yuanyuan Road.</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo to Hold National Homing Pigeon Exhibition on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Homing Pigeon Research Association of the Municipal Zoo will hold a National Homing Pigeon Exhibition on the 8th and 9th of this month.

<h3>Central Agricultural Farm Establishes Seedling Department</h3>
<p>The Central Agricultural Farm on Fuli Road, occupying two mu of land, is one of the largest agricultural farms in the country. It has been actively promoting agriculture and forestry and researching planting techniques. Recently, concerned about the decline of the domestic horticultural industry, it has invested heavily in importing famous breeds and applying scientific methods to actively improve them. Over the past few years, it has achieved remarkable results. Recently, a seedling department has been established, and skilled technicians have been specially hired to graft and cultivate all the rare and high-quality varieties into seedlings, which are widely distributed to promote their adoption. The prices are extremely low, making it a boon for the horticultural industry. It is reported that the farm has published a large book called "Central Agricultural Farm Special," which contains detailed information on all aspects of fruit tree horticulture based on practical experience, along with a catalog of the farm's products. Those who wish to obtain it only need to attach a one-cent postage stamp.

<h3>Dyeing and Refining Industries; Suggesting Using the Metric System for Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association and the Refining Industry Association, recently recognized that the lengths of dyed and refined silk piece goods are excessively long, resulting in significant losses when priced per piece. Additionally, the prices of various raw materials such as "pigments" and "coal" required by the dyeing industry have been soaring, making costs high and work difficult. It is impossible to sustain the industry without cooperation and rectification between the two industries. The Refining Industry Association suggested that the pricing of refined silk should abolish the piece system and adopt the metric system, calculating prices per meter, and that accounts should be settled monthly. They requested the Dyeing Industry Association to cooperate. The Dyeing Industry Association acknowledged the possibility of adopting the same approach and convened a meeting to discuss the matter. The issue of monthly settlement is also being carefully considered. It is generally agreed that adopting the metric system is feasible. The Dyeing Industry Association is working intensely on the rectification plan. All members have demonstrated their determination to fully comply with the association's resolutions on business matters and voluntarily agreed to be fully liable for any losses incurred in violating the resolutions and orders. The attitude is firm. If the industry adopts the metric system, all original price lists will be abolished, and new prices will be set, and a new dyeing price list will be compiled. A special committee will be formed in the future to properly draft and compile the new price list to ensure that dyeing prices are suitable for current trends and the socio-economic environment. It is reported that the Dyeing Industry Association will convene a general meeting today to make a decision.</p>

<h3>New Invention; Plant Oil Lamp Practical and Useful</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a new invention on the market that is extremely practical. Although the item is small, it is essential for both cities and villages. This is the wall lamp produced by the China Oil Lamp Factory. It can be hung on the wall in any household, large or small, eliminating the risk of tipping over or breaking. It provides bright illumination and convenient mobility, making it truly useful. The general public is happy to use it. However, the oil lamp factory is constantly improving the product to achieve perfection. Even the wick is being modified to use two sizes: one-third of an inch wide and one-fifth of an inch wide, to ensure that customers can choose the appropriate size. If a one-third-inch wick is used, it can save 40% of oil compared to the current one-fifth-inch wick, yet its brightness is almost the same to the naked eye. Currently, the wall lamps are made partly by hand, which makes the cost high, so the selling price has not yet become widespread. The factory is actively improving the manufacturing process, hoping to reduce costs and lower prices, so that it can be adopted by the general public. There are already six types of lamps being manufactured, including two types of iron table lamps, which will be sold for 40 or 50 cents each, and one type made of glass, priced the same. The small iron wall lamps will sell for only about 20 cents each. The general manager's office is located at the Yifeng Enamel Company's distribution department at No. 224 Avenue Edward VII. The company's operations are well-managed, so its business is growing day by day, which is also good news for the national products industry.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Announces New Pricing Rates</h3>
<p>Effective March 1st, the new pricing rates of the Shanghai Telephone Company, which have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council, were announced yesterday. The method of charging by the number of calls will be implemented from March 1st. According to the company's calculations, the charging method based on the number of calls is as follows: for business wall-mounted telephones, the monthly fee is 10 yuan, which allows for 150 calls per month. If this number is exceeded, each additional call will be charged at 3 cents. For desk telephones, the monthly fee is 10 yuan and 50 cents, with the same number of calls as wall-mounted telephones. For residential wall-mounted telephones, the monthly fee is 6 yuan and 50 cents, which allows for 100 calls per month. If this number is exceeded, each additional call will also be charged at 3 cents. For desk telephones, the monthly fee is 7 yuan, with the same number of calls. For auxiliary lines, the monthly fee is 5 yuan per line for wall-mounted telephones and 5 yuan and 50 cents for desk telephones. For extensions, regardless of whether they are connected to the main line or auxiliary line, business or residential, the monthly fee per telephone is 1 yuan for wall-mounted telephones and 1 yuan and 50 cents for desk telephones. For example, if a company has two telephone lines, the old price would be 13 yuan and 28 cents per line per month, totaling 26 yuan and 56 cents for both lines. Under the new pricing rates, with one main line and one auxiliary line, the total cost would be only 15 yuan. According to this calculation, installing two business telephone lines would allow for 150 local calls per month, which is a saving of 11 yuan and 56 cents compared to the old price. Furthermore, at 3 cents per call, an additional 385 calls can be made. In other words, for the same price, 535 calls can be made, averaging 17 calls per day, which is not much more expensive than before. Moreover, if fewer than 17 calls are made per day, the cost will be even lower. For residential users, the current monthly fee is 10 yuan and 4 cents for desk telephones and 8 yuan and 41 cents for wall-mounted telephones. From March 1st, desk telephone users can save 3 yuan and 4 cents, which, at 3 cents per call, allows for 101 additional calls, totaling 201 calls per month. Wall-mounted telephone users can save 1 yuan and 90 cents, which, at 3 cents per call, allows for 63 additional calls, totaling 163 calls per month, or 5 to 6 calls per day. If residential users do not make many calls, they can further reduce their costs. According to company employees, the new pricing rates, which calculate charges based on the number of calls, are particularly beneficial for those who make fewer calls. Therefore, calculating by the number of calls is indeed the only way to reward local users who make fewer calls. The number of calls made is recorded by machines, which is very accurate. Each user's line has a meter connected to it, and the recording on this meter only occurs after the caller's line is connected to the receiver's line and a dial tone is received. Furthermore, incoming calls do not incur any charges for the receiver. If the number dialed is busy or there is no dial tone, the call is not recorded. Calls to the company's departments (94090), the directory assistance (09), the repair department (01), or emergency calls (00) are free of charge. Details regarding the implementation of the new pricing rates and other miscellaneous fees will be announced separately. New price lists and general regulations for all users will be printed soon and displayed in the business department of the main office on Jiangxi Road for users to refer to and review. Users in the northern and western suburbs of Shanghai will also be charged according to the new method. However, calls to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Chinese Territory will be charged according to the original method.</p>

As it entered the port yesterday morning and was heading towards the Ling Hua Wharf on the Pudong side of the South City, a fleet of sailboats suddenly emerged from the Pudong side and crossed the Hua Sheng's path. The Hua Sheng steamer urgently tried to avoid them. However, due to the strong winds and shallow waters in the Huangpu River, the bow of the steamer collided with the Ling Hua Wharf on its left side. The pressure from the tidal waves made it impossible to stop.</p>
<p>Both the ship and wharf were damaged. The collision caused considerable damage to the Ling Hua Wharf. The Hua Sheng steamer also suffered heavy damage due to the force of the impact. The ship's bow was bent and folded to one side. A large hole, measuring several tens of feet square, was made in the forward hold on the port side. After the incident, the ship's owner and the wharf authorities inspected the damage and reported it to their respective companies for handling.</p>
<p>Inspection and coal discharge. Upon receiving the report, Yitai Hing immediately reported it to the Joint Association of Marine Underwriters. The Hua Sheng steamer was towed to the Longhua Cement Plant Wharf in the afternoon, where it began discharging its coal cargo. The Joint Association of Marine Underwriters will then send a marine surveyor to inspect the ship and arrange for repairs. It is understood that the ship's major overhaul is due, and it has been decided to take this opportunity to enter the dock for a major repair.</p>
<h3>The Xin Jiang Tian Steamer Arrived Late in Shanghai Yesterday; Xin Ming Replaces it on the Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>The Xin Jiang Tian steamer is a regular ship on the Ningbo route operated by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sailing on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. On January 30th, when the ship arrived in Shanghai and was docking at the Jin Li Yuan Wharf, it was customary for the ship to turn around. However, while turning outside the Ning Shao Wharf breakwater, the ship's port propeller wing collided with the riverbed. The screws came loose, but the captain did not report this to the head office at the time.</p>
<p>Propeller Wing Fell Off. On the afternoon of January 31st, after loading cargo and passengers in Ningbo, the ship set sail for Shanghai from Ningbo. It temporarily stopped at Zhenhai to load cargo. At 6:00 PM, when leaving the Zhenhai Wharf, while reversing, the screws of the port engine wing came loose, and the wing fell into the sea. The captain immediately unloaded the cargo that had been loaded in Zhenhai in order to reduce the draft. Fortunately, the ship had two propellers and two engines, so it could still勉强 (mianqiang: barely manage) reach Shanghai.</p>
<p>Late Arrival in Port. The ship's engine is a Triple type, so even with one engine wing missing, it was still possible to shut down one engine and use the starboard single-wing engine to sail to Shanghai. However, sailing with a single starboard propeller caused severe vibrations and was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, the chief engineer Zhang Gaohua and the second engineer were experienced and were able to bravely cross the sea and return to Shanghai. However, the ship arrived late in Shanghai yesterday, only reaching the wharf at noon. Passengers celebrated, and the crew felt relieved. Yesterday afternoon, in addition to the captain reporting the loss of the engine wing to the Bureau, the chief shipowner Shen Jiyun summoned the ship's crew and the pilot He Hongyao to the Bureau to inquire about the incident. The ship cannot sail and has been ordered to suspend its schedule. A report has been sent to the Joint Association of Marine Underwriters to send personnel to survey the damage. Today, the ship will enter the Yeesong Shipyard to repair and install a new wing.</p>
<p>Xin Ming Replaces the Ship on the Route. The Xin Jiang Tian was built in 1921, with a tonnage of 3,644 tons, a full-load draft of 11 feet 6 inches, a total length of 300 feet, a width of 28 feet 2 inches, and a horsepower of 2,000. It has two large boilers using a steam pressure of 180 and can travel at 12 nautical miles per hour. It has been suspended from service since last night, and the Bureau has reassigned the Xin Ming, a regular ship on the Northern routes, to replace it on the Ningbo route.</p>

<h3>Nanyang Wireless School Employs the Latest Equipment</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Wireless Telegraph Training School on Rue Bellesmée in Shanghai has been established for many years and was the first to promote wireless telegraphy vocational education. It has a strong reputation for excellent management, and its graduates serve in telecommunications agencies throughout the country. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation stipulated an extension of the study period for all telecommunications training schools and an increase in the level of Morse code reception and transmission. Radio stations are now using automatic machines to test telegraph operators. In light of this, the school raised a large sum of money to purchase a complete set of automatic high-speed telegraphy and puncher equipment and laid out a headset wiring network in the classroom following the training methods of European and American telecommunications schools. It is reported that the latest equipment has been completed and will be used for automatic training in the future, making it convenient for students to take exams and serve in radio stations after graduation. Other practical instruments will also be added. An exhibition is scheduled to open in early February. Based on past teaching experience, the school has found that students with slightly poorer aptitudes in wireless telegraphy theory and technology often find it difficult to understand and master the subject. Therefore, starting from the next term, tutoring and guidance sessions will be offered in addition to the regular courses to improve teaching efficiency. It is reported that enrollment has already begun.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Final Trial: China Team Loses to Pirates Due to Full Rotation Tactics for Final Selection; Result: 47 to 31, Game Lacked Excitement</h3>
<p>The national basketball pre-selection for the World Games held its final trial yesterday against the Pirates. It took place at Shen Garden at 7 PM. Of the 20 Chinese candidates, 17 participated, excluding Wang Yuzeng, Yu Jingxiao, and Bao Wenpei. They were divided into four groups and rotated on court to observe each player's skills and make the final selection. However, this rotation caused the team to lose its center of gravity, resulting in a lackluster performance that allowed the Pirates to seize the opportunity and win with a score of 47 to 31, a difference of 16 points. Although China treated it as a pre-selection and didn't prioritize winning, the Pirates considered it a victory over the Chinese team, avenging their loss the previous night. Towards the end, the audience chanted for Wang Yuzeng to play, but the selection committee stuck to their opinions, disregarding public sentiment. After the game, a few disgruntled spectators surrounded Dong Shouyi, Shu Hong, and others, intending to harass them. While we condemn the audience's unruly behavior, we also cannot defend the selection committee's decisions.</p>
<h3>First Quarter: 8 to 4, China Leads, Game Situation Lacks Spark</h3>
<p>The starting lineup for China consisted of Shen Yukong and Yin Guiren (forwards), Liu Baocheng (center), Wang Shixuan and Cai Yanxiong (guards). Both sides struggled to find their rhythm initially. Each team received free throws, but neither capitalized. After four or five minutes of stalemate, the Pirates' Lan Ying, with his height and reach, tossed the ball into the basket. Shen Yukong followed with a beautiful long-range shot, and Liu Baocheng added two more points. Shen and Liu combined for three points, giving China a 7 to 2 lead. The Pirates' shots missed their mark, showing signs of anxiety. The tall Lan Ying scored a second basket under the basket. Shen Yukong then made a free throw, making it 8 to 4. The Pirates replaced Smith with Bai Naite. China made a complete lineup change.</p>
<p>In this quarter, the entire Chinese team fell apart, with each player acting independently. Shen Yukong's long-range shots were excellent. Yin Guiren was mediocre as usual. Liu Baocheng was dull and slow, just an ordinary center. Wang Shixuan was aggressive and brave, while Cai Yanxiong was lively and commendable. The two guards were satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Second Quarter: 14 to 12, China Wins but Situation Remains Stiff</h3>
<p>After ten minutes, China made a complete lineup change, replacing the previous five with Wang Hongbin, Xu Zhaoxiong (forwards), Xu Heng (center), Sun Baoqing, and Li Heding (guards). Xu Heng, as a center, lacked courage and was no different from Liu Baocheng. Chen Xianglong was actually better than Xu and Liu. Wang and Xu performed well, but lacked contribution. The team had no communication and the tactical play was uninspired. Little Xu's strategy was only slightly better than Shen Yukong's beyond having some skillful manuevering. Sun Baoqing was far better than Li Heding. In this quarter, the Pirates gained momentum, with Bai Naite and Sguia being the most active. Carson was able to fulfill his duties, focusing on defense. China only scored two baskets through Xu Zhaoxiong and one through Wang Hongbin, resulting in a score of 8 to 6. The overall score was 14 to 12. China led by two points at the end of the first half. In total, the Pirates missed all nine free throws in the first half.</p>
<h3>Third Quarter: 21 to 27, Pirates Overtake, Intense Game</h3>
<p>The second half started with another complete lineup change for China. Feng Nianhua, Mou Zuoyun (forwards), Xu Heng (center), Zhao Zhihua, and Yin Huanwen (guards) took to the court. Feng and Mou were excellent at rushing forward and showed good coordination. Unfortunately, Xu Heng failed to fulfill his role as a center, with his dribbling and passing being slow. Zhao Zhihua and Yin Huanwen performed decently. At the beginning, Little Feng twice evaded defenders' arms with his agility, scoring two consecutive baskets. The Pirates also defended and attacked vigorously. Bessel and Sguia were active everywhere, becoming the backbone of the Pirates, while Smith seemed mediocre. The score then became 20 to 18, with the Pirates taking the lead. Feng Nianhua scored another three points, and Smith and Carson made it 17 to 21, giving the Pirates a six-point lead. At that moment, the audience chanted for Wang Yuzeng to play, like refugees pleading for help in a disaster area.</p>
<h3>Fourth Quarter: 31 to 47, China Remains Lackluster and Loses</h3>
<p>In the last ten minutes, Wang Hongbin and Mou Zuoyun, two ideal forwards, played, with Liu Baocheng still as the center, and Liu Yunzhang and Wang Nanzhen as guards. The game was particularly intense due to the Pirates' aggression. However, Liu and the two forwards couldn't coordinate well. Wang Nanzhen was sharp and skilled, excelling in both offense and defense, and was undoubtedly the best guard in China at the moment, without any flaws. Liu Yunzhang was ordinary. It was truly lamentable that such a player could be selected as a candidate, indicating the lack of talent in China. Li Shaotang was later substituted, but the situation was already out of control, making it impossible to recover lost ground. The two forwards contributed little due to the center's clumsiness. From then on, the Pirates played with ease, soaring to victory with a score of 47 to 31.</p>
<h3>After the Basketball Trial: Should Li Zhenzhong be Selected?</h3>
<p>The World Games basketball pre-selection has now concluded. After three preliminary rounds and three trial matches, the selection committee members should have a thorough understanding of each player's skills and have a clear plan in mind. The criticisms and proposed lineups seen in recent newspapers, as well as the suggestions for future training, are all relevant and should not be ignored. In particular, the lineup (14 players) published in a certain newspaper on the 28th is said to be based on the instructions of a member of the selection committee, and we sympathize with that. However, what we want to discuss now is the issue of whether the players from the National Guoshu Institute's basketball team, which was on a southern expedition, should be eligible for selection.</p>
<p>The National Guoshu Institute team's southern expedition plan was announced before the national basketball pre-selection. Later, they were asked to suspend their southern expedition and participate in the national pre-selection, which naturally caused many difficulties for their school. To deprive them of the opportunity to be selected because of these difficulties and because the National Guoshu Institute could not suspend their southern expedition does not seem very legitimate. While one team cannot affect the entire group, if the entire group is not yet perfect, and the National Guoshu Institute's players can supplement it to achieve perfection, we absolutely cannot arbitrarily abandon such talent.</p>
<p>The current candidate team lacks a center. To be honest, Liu Baocheng and Xu Heng are not qualified enough. Li Zhenzhong is the best center in the country, capable of both defense and offense. His skills are no less than Wang Yuzeng's. If the two are selected together, the team will definitely be more organized. If Zhang Jing can strictly guide and supervise him to avoid committing fouls, he would be a tiger general as a guard. Although Tang Baokun has lost his golden era, and there is no hope for a comeback, with his current skills, he might as well be a reserve player. Of course, the most important is still Li Zhenzhong.</p>
<p>Among the current twenty candidates, many are勉强, such as Liu Yunzhang and Yu Jingxiao. It would not be difficult to find such talents in any first-class team. From an overall perspective, our country's basketball has not made progress. We hope that after the official team is decided, they will play two more games against the Pirates, and then train together in the dormitories.</p>
<p>"Representing China at the Berlin World Games is an unparalleled honor for any Chinese youth. Only those with true basketball skills should be selected without regret. If someone who should be selected is rejected, it is not only unfair to the player but also unfair to the entire Chinese team. Only those with true basketball skills have the right to wear the Chinese team jersey to participate in the 11th World Games." This is what should be paid attention to when selecting any team to attend the World Games.</p>
<h3>A Parting Glance: Korea Defeats China Yesterday, 2-1 Victory</h3>
<p>The team's skills are indeed not bad. Their solid footwork, quick running, and courageous and tenacious spirit of passing and stealing are beyond reproach. It was particularly unfortunate that they lost to North China. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, they played a friendly match against the Shanghai China team at Shen Garden and showed their true colors. From beginning to end, they held the upper hand without any slackening. In particular, Kim Sung-gan's incisive thrusts and quick movements and Zheng Long-soo's solid defense and dedication to duty were the most outstanding. The Shanghai team is known for its skills, but they were unable to cope with Yeonhee's ferocity. Li Yichen still moved slowly, Sun Jinshun missed too many opportunities, and Chen Zhenhe was not as fierce as in the past. He had no chance to develop in the second half after being reassigned to the left wing. Li Ning's performance was worse than before, while Jiang Shanjing worked hard and saved many dangerous balls. The rest were mediocre. They tried to counterattack in the second half, but mistakes were repeated, and great opportunities were missed. If it were not for Jinshun's penalty kick from the twelve-yard spot, Shanghai would have ended the game without scoring. Over two thousand spectators watched, with many Korean residents in Shanghai coming to cheer them on. The referee was Shen Huichun.</p>
<h3>Wei Huide Opens the Scoring</h3>
<p>At 3 PM sharp, the Shanghai team kicked off against the wind. The Korean team intercepted the ball, and the five forwards advanced together with great momentum. Kim Sung-gan and Wei Huide led the way, with Kim In-seok following up, and Han Gap-seok and Kim Kyung-han flanking on either side. They quickly approached the Shanghai goal. Li Ning, experienced and shrewd, waited in ambush. The Korean five forwards retreated in frustration. Feng Yunyou passed the ball through the center, and Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun, a pair of old partners, advanced. Zheng Long-soo, infuriated, moved like the wind, and the ball was lost. Li Yuying dribbled deep into the field, full of ambition, and took a long-range shot from twenty yards out, but the ball went over the post. The Korean team did not lose heart and continued to work hard. Li Bong-ho took advantage of Han Gap-seok and Kim Sung-gan's exploits in front of the goal, but the ball rebounded off the goalpost. Kim Kyung-han was offside, invalidating the play. The Korean team's attack intensified. Jiang Shanjing unfortunately committed a foul. Zheng Long-soo took the free kick, and the ball landed in front of the goal. Kim Kyung-han violated the rules again. The Shanghai team took the opportunity to counterattack, and Gu Shangkui rose up in the middle, with Little Black Coal being brave and commanding the army. Li Yichen swept the ball out of bounds while lying on the ground. Sun Jinshun's footwork was uninspired, and the ball flew behind the net. Kim Sung-gan launched another attack. Gu Shangkui was careless in front of the goal and lost the ball, but Zhang Rongcai was too late to save it and swept it out of danger while lying on the ground. After thirty minutes, Kim Sung-gan broke through alone and dribbled to the byline. Li Ning was unable to stop him, and Kim Sung-gan crossed the ball in. Wei Huide was waiting and volleyed the ball into the net from the right corner, opening the scoring. The Shanghai team was defeated and filled with anger, and the three armies were ordered to fight. The five forwards advanced together, but Zheng Long-soo and Hong Sung-eun remained calm and rescued the situation from the chaotic army, declaring it safe. With a whistle, the first half ended.</p>
<h3>Penalty Kick Saves Them From a Shutout</h3>
<p>In the second half, the Shanghai team was determined to wipe out the shame, and the lineup changed greatly. Jia Youliang showed his talent for the first time, and Li Yichen retreated to the defense. The Korean team did not care and continued to be rampant. Within three minutes, Liu Xichun sneaked in along the wing and crossed the ball perfectly. Li Ning's header missed, and bad luck befell them. Kim Sung-gan pounced like a hungry tiger catching an eagle, benefiting like a fisherman and kicking the ball into the net, giving the Korean team a 2-0 lead. Sun Jinshun led the generals, marching in a mighty manner, leading the troops deep into the field, vowing to recover the lost ground. Zheng Long-soo took the lead, blocking the way. Sun Jinshun changed his strategy, passing the ball to Youliang from afar. Zheng Long-soo relied on his bravery and came to steal the ball again, unfortunately touching the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Sun Iron Leg gritted his teeth, and the ball was low and fast. Kim Chung-hyun was unable to save it, and the ball drilled into the net, with the Shanghai team scoring a goal. Morale was boosted, and courage increased. Jia Youliang dribbled straight to the gate, passing the ball to the center. Sun Jinshun's legs were weak, and the ball went out of bounds. Gu Shangkui made a comeback, echoing each other with Chen Zhenhe, and forced his way into the Korean heartland again. Hong Sung-eun blocked it into a corner kick. At this time, the Shanghai team's attack was extremely fierce, but unfortunately, fate was unkind, and the ball often went over the goal without entering. The Korean team survived the dangerous situation and took the opportunity to attack again. Han Gap-seok took the corner kick, and the landing point was very good. Zhang Rongcai jumped up and hit the ball, but the ball did not go far. Kim Sung-gan used the same trick again, kicking the ball without landing, and Zhang Rongcai could not rush back in time. Li Yichen temporarily took his place and kicked the ball out, avoiding disaster. The situation was extremely dangerous. Feng Yunyou transferred the supplies again, and Zhong Yongsen regretted being polite and letting him go. Jiang Shanjing descended like a flying general, hurriedly saving the situation. Jia Youliang rebelled on the border, transporting and passing to the center. Sun Jinshun was monitored too strictly by Li Yuying, and there was no room for him to use his strength. Ding Haidun disregarded the pros and cons, using his hand instead of his foot. Xu Jingcheng kicked the free kick arbitrarily, and the ball landed right in front of the goal. Sun Jinshun ran out of the crowd and kicked it, the ball was fast and powerful, but Kim Chung-hyun was prepared and caught it with both hands, ruining the effort. After that, they came and went back and forth, but nothing was accomplished, and time was up. The Korean team sang a triumphant song with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Youyou Eliminates St. Francis, Wins the Right to the Junior Cup Final: 3-0, a One-Sided Situation</p>
<p>The teams that qualified for the Western League Junior Cup were Youyou, Military Medical, Innes, and St. Francis. Among them, Youyou was the most likely to win the championship. In terms of strength, they were also the best of the bunch. Because Youyou was tragically eliminated by the Western Police in the first game of the Scotta Cup, they were determined to win the cup and went all out.

<h3>Children's Education Novel: Little Men (164)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiaocang, Original Work by Louisa M. Alcott</p>
<p>One day, as he passed through the poplar grove, he saw some boys climbing trees and using the elasticity of the slender branches to swing down, thinking it was fun. Don remained for a moment to watch their game, but did not join in. While he stood there, it was Jack's turn. Unfortunately, Jack chose a tree that was too thick, because when he swung out, the tree only bent slightly, leaving him hanging high in the air, which was quite dangerous.</p>
<p>"Come back; you can't do it!" Ned shouted from below.</p>
<p>Jack also tried to go back, but the branches slipped from his hands, and he couldn't wrap his legs around the tree trunk. He kicked, he dragged, he tried to grab, but in the end, it was no use. Finally, he was desperate, just hanging in the air, unable to breathe, pitifully shouting:</p>
<p>"Catch me! Save me! I'm going to fall!"</p>
<p>"You're going to fall to your death," Ned said, terrified.</p>
<p>"Don't let go!" Don shouted; he then ran up the tree, making his way through the leaves until he was almost beside Jack, whose face was looking at him, filled with fear and hope.</p>
<p>"You two are going to come down," Ned said, jumping on the slope below, very excited, and extending his arms as if to catch them.</p>
<p>"That's exactly what we want. People below, move away," Don said calmly. As he spoke, the added weight caused the tree to droop even further, a few feet from the ground.</p>

The HSBC's posted rate was announced, with both the US and UK remaining flat. Chinese merchants sold off US dollars, and the banks continued to buy, and the situation remained unchanged.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Were Not Auctioned Yesterday, Brokers Were Busy with Meetings and Rosters, Market Trading Was Ineffectively Suspended All Day, Underground Market Reportedly Rose by $2-3 the Day Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, February 1st, after the delivery of the January futures, the market was originally scheduled to open as usual and add the auction of March futures trading. Because the Ministry of Finance ordered the submission of actual goods and sealed all the bonds stored in the three banks of China, Zhongnan, and Jiaotong, it caused special difficulties in the January delivery the day before. Although it was gradually resolved after 9:30, it was still necessary to thoroughly investigate whether the brokers had any government personnel buying and selling speculation. Although there was no intentional disruption, it was still necessary to conduct a thorough investigation and report in detail the quantity of January delivery bonds bought and sold by each broker on behalf of customers, the real names of both buyers and sellers, and the accurate principals for all February futures trading. As a result, the brokers were busy compiling and reporting until 5 p.m., and they had not yet completed all the reports, so the exchange was also unable to open, and was suspended for the entire day. The brokers also held a meeting of colleagues at 8 p.m., partly for the sake of their own business reputation, and partly for the matter of submitting the existing goods for old transactions, which was discussed at length. The meeting lasted a very long time, resulting in the ineffective suspension of trading on the exchange. There are still questions as to whether trading will be able to open on time next Monday. It was rumored that the underground market had risen by $2-3 on the 31st, and sellers added $2 yesterday, but were unable to close.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported (31st) that the New York stock market rose sharply, and most stocks rose to their highest peaks since 1931. The rise in industrial stocks was due to the bright prospects for industry and many optimistic rumors of profits, such as the rumor that Chrysler Corporation's profits in 1935 were equivalent to $7.5 per share. The rise in public utilities stocks was due to increased electricity production, and it was hoped that the Supreme Court would rule the Tennessee Valley Authority power plant case illegal next Monday. Railroad stocks rose due to increased freight traffic. The bond market was mixed and firm, and small exchange stocks rose briskly. The total transaction volume for the day was 3.3 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: U.S. Cotton Discovers Flaws, Yarn and Cotton's Declining Trend is Difficult to Reverse, Golden Rooster and Sanpin Each Fall by About $2, Spot Cotton Also Has a Decline of 8 or 9 Corners</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is drastic, because overseas cotton industries have all suffered severe losses, which has greatly affected investor sentiment and slightly increased selling pressure. At the same time, the demand for spot yarn is also lifeless, and the market outlook is becoming weaker. However, Da Kee is buying to cover, but it is still difficult to curb the declining trend.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Cuts Longs and Adds Shorts Simultaneously</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with a lower opening for each month due to the weakness of the overseas cotton market, and the situation became softer. Osaka Sanpin yarn fell sharply by more than $2. At the same time, spot yarn sales remained sluggish, and floating longs closed out, resulting in a looser market price. As a result, each month fell by $1 to $1.234 compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still bleak and lifeless. Because of the poor overseas news, Changfeng large longs cut positions in large quantities, and Yuda shorts added positions. However, Da Kee made a lot of coverage. As a result, each month fell by .2569 corners compared to the morning closing price. The sales were Heshing 1650 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Yuanyi 600 bales, Runkang 1650 bales, Xincheng 1050 bales, Yuda 1550 bales, Yichang 950 bales, Changfeng 2050 bales. The purchases were Dafu 850 bales, Tonghe 400 bales, Tongji 550 bales, Da Kee 2150 bales, Jinchang 1050 bales, Yicheng 800 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, Dachang 1750 bales, Heshing 600 bales, Shenji 1550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Falls by 5 Corners to $1</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still low. Statistics show that 515 bales were sold by various groups throughout the day. The market price fell by 5 corners to $1. The purchases by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market fell because the US cotton government did not express its decision on the plan to stockpile large quantities in March, and a flaw was discovered in the market price. The Indian cotton trend was not good, and the decline became sharper. As a result, investor sentiment was panicked, and selling pressure was strong. The gold industry longs came out one after another, and the market price fell step by step.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Gold Industry Longs Cut Positions</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened, because US cotton fell by 5 to 29 points, and Indian cotton fell by .025 to 2 rupees and a half. The white block for April and May repeatedly broke the 200 rupee mark. The future situation is still bearish. Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by .78 corners to $1. As a result, market sentiment shook, and selling pressure was strong. Each month fell in a straight line. However, Da Kee bought in large quantities. As a result, each month fell by .25 to .345 corners compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was because the gold bar closed at a low price, and the gold industry longs cut their positions in large quantities, making the trading floor even looser and more chaotic, and the market price became even more difficult to support. As a result, each month fell by another .35 to .4 corners compared to the morning closing price. The sales were Jifeng 1500 dan, Yuda 5100 dan, Guangfeng 7300 dan, Tongfeng 2400 dan, Changfeng 1700 dan, Runkang 5400 dan, Yikang 1800 dan, Tongji 1000 dan, Heshing 2700 dan, Changhe 8800 dan. The purchases were Shenji 2400 dan, Yuanda 1100 dan, Da Kee 11700 dan, Heshing 3000 dan, Senkang 3100 dan, Yuanyi 4700 dan, Changhe 2100 dan, Mingde 1700 dan, Changji 2000 dan, Dachang 2700 dan, Yuanxingchang 2500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton, Both Chinese and Foreign Factories are Buying</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still quite good. Both Chinese and foreign factories are buying. The source is Yao cotton, 38.</p>
<h3>Cotton Borrowed at 1.2 Corners May Be Released, U.S. Cotton Falls Sharply by Over 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened, and the market situation was uncertain. Each month rose and fell by 5 points. Traders feared that cotton borrowed at 1.2 corners would be released, sold off old cotton, and bought new cotton. However, this plan has not yet been determined. Longs in the market closed out, and new buying was lacking, leading to a downward trend. Because investor sentiment feared that the amount of government selling would exceed what the July term could absorb, they sold off one after another, and the market price fell sharply. Finally, a small number of shorts covered, and there was a slight recovery. Hester estimated that factory use this week was 330,000 bales, and Liverpool's reserves were 389,000 bales. Spot goods fell by 25 points, and futures fell by 5 to 29 points. British cotton spot goods fell by 3 points, and futures fell by 2 points. Indian cotton futures traders sold off and a large number of longs closed out, but were absorbed by European exporters and Japanese traders. The Pingle rose or fell by .25 rupees, Aumra fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees, and Bairochi fell by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 31st).</p>
<p>Also according to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bai Luoxi cotton on the 1st was 196 bis, down 1.75 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Both Fall</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram of the 1st. The Sanpin market only traded for half a day. Term yarn fell by $2.10 to $2.60. The near month was $193.20, and the far month was $192.30. Term cotton fell by 85 cents to $1.20. The near month was $61.20, and the far month was $59.20.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Statistics Last Week (Units: Thousands of Bales)</h3>
<p>Weekend Inventory</p>
<h3>Spot White Bales in This Port Suddenly Decrease, January 31st Survey Only Shows an Increase in Foreign Shelves</h3>
<p>The Yarn and Cloth Exchange in this city convened a cotton appraisal meeting on January 18 for the purpose of delivery in July 25. The results of the review showed that all were the same as the June grade, with no changes at all. Cotton yarn has been revised to be inspected every two months starting this year. Spot yarn in July has no grading for review, and is inspected and graded in June.</p>
<p>Starting from the 1st, spot cotton in February will be subject to an additional special margin of 3 yuan per dan for all new transactions, and will be collected in both accounts.</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Manufacturers Slightly Hedging, The Trend for Each Month is Gradually Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and the state of each month was generally loosening and weakening. The quoted price of foreign wheat was Chicago better by 8 tenths to 1 corner, and Canadian better by about 2 corners. Market sentiment was watching because the rebound the day before was too sudden, and there were rumors of foreign wheat transactions, which made investor sentiment very flat. The opening prices for each month were slightly lower by 1 or 2 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, off-industry longs stepped up their disposals, and factories also slightly hedged, so the trend gradually loosened. However, the reserves were still not abundant, and if there were no special changes in the later trend, the outlook would still be flat. The new flour in July has also been opened for auction as usual. The initial price was $2.95, and the closing price was $2.9675, better by 1 cent and 7 tenths.</p>
<h3>Term and Spot Wheat Trading Both Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the term wheat market opened in the morning, and transactions for each month were not prosperous. The market was stagnant because off-industry players were not moving. Each month was down by 1 or 2 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were still not smooth, but the flour market turned soft, and prices loosened slightly again. The opening price for new standard wheat in July was $4.35, and transactions were smooth, with slight price changes. Since the new harvest is still far away, changes will be significant. In the spot wheat market, prices were stable, reserves were not abundant, and transactions were very few. Only 500 bags of Shandong Bay wheat were offered, priced at $5.15, and were handled by Fufu.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market Opened Red and Sales are Still Robust, Although Goods Arrive in Droves, Each Rose by 1, 2, 3, and 4 Corners Respectively</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Since the market closed last year, a total of more than 160 shipments have arrived at the South Shanghai rice source (a total of more than 32,000 stones of goods). Yesterday, the red market sales were smooth, and both retail and wholesale appetites were healthy. It is estimated that 7-8 thousand stones were sold in this street area. Tianjin, Weihai, Qingdao, and other groups took more than 3000 packages of thick japonica rice and more than 8000 packages of thin paddy rice. Therefore, the result was that the red market opening was able to rise compared to last year. The price of thick early japonica rice was higher by 2-3 corners, the price of thin paddy rice was higher by 3-4 corners, and Duyang sharp and Yinbianyuan all had the beauty of 2-3 feet.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) In the past two days, the sources from various inland roads and river accumulation were quite thick, totaling about 200 shipments. Although the sales of various goods on the market were all social transactions, the sales were still not bad, resulting in the market price being higher by 1-2 corners for white japonica rice compared to last year's closing, early rice was higher by 2-3 corners, thin paddy Tianjin appetite was also manageable for zero consumption, and the price was tighter by 3 corners, white yuan was stable, and Yin yuan was closely linked to the near corner, Yangbu sharp was upright, guest sharp was tighter by 1-2 corners, and the remaining various goods were also more expensive near the corner.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Continues to Be Stockpiled by Guests, and Goods Can Arrive from Various Places</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of guest indica rice gradually began to arrive from various ports along the Yangtze River. Jiangxi, Xianghan, Shashi, and various prefectures of Zhejiang all had shipments on the way. Because the Shanghai market was reporting higher prices, all parties heard about shipping out. The Shanghai reserves were originally abundant, and the arrival of a peak inevitably caused investor sentiment to turn soft. However, because both domestic and guest stockpiles were greedy, the market sentiment remained upright. Yesterday, this street was the most active, and the stockholders also inquired about Gan rice. The Xiamen gang had 360 packages of Ganjiang rice and Guangdong red oil rice shipped out. Tianjin sent 600 packages of Siamese rice, this street and stockholders sent 10,000 packages of Gan rice, 3110 packages of Wentai, 537 packages of Xiang rice, and more than 300 packages of Anqing and Hangzhou. The market situation was mostly similar to the previous market, but Zhongguan goods were slightly more popular among domestic customers.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Miscellaneous Sugar Opened at Over 400 Packages Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market association divided the disk, such as 24 coarse sand white and Dong Chi Bai, etc. Market prices all lacked ups and downs. The number goods had Jianbang opened a batch of miscellaneous white, the higher one was 19 yuan and 2 corners, followed by 15 yuan and 8 corners to 5-6 corners, and red sugar was 12 yuan and a half. A total of more than 400 packages were traded, with little ups and downs compared to previous white sugar, but red sugar fell by 4-5 corners.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, Dried Lily Flower Price Surge</h3>
<p>Since the market reopened, dried lily flowers have seen a significant price surge due to low inventory. Buyers from Guangdong, Fujian, and Wenzhou-Taizhou areas have also been active, collectively purchasing over 400 packages in recent days. Prices ranged from 26 to 24 yuan, considered cheap. Yesterday, the top-grade product opened at 30 yuan, with slightly lower prices for lower grades, representing a rise of six to seven yuan. Sellers from Xuzhou were even asking 33 yuan. Local merchants in the town are observing the market and unwilling to sell much, resulting in only about a hundred packages being sold. Simultaneously, a long-distance phone call from Zhenjiang production area reported a rise of five to six yuan, with about a hundred packages offered at 28 yuan, but sellers were later unwilling to continue selling. According to industry insiders, some anticipate prices to reach 40 yuan. Even if that level is difficult to achieve immediately, they believe 35 to 36 yuan is likely achievable soon. Black melon seed inventory is also low, and prices have been raised repeatedly, with continued increases. Yesterday, a seller offered a hundred packages of Zhuangzi brand at 19.5 yuan, and 224 packages of Mingguangzi brand at 16 yuan, both up by one yuan. Furthermore, Cong Ji Xu Kuizi was offered at 19 yuan, with expectations of at least another one or two yuan increase in the future, and market sentiment is very stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Some Movement in Drawn Core Zhen Mei Tea Sales</h3>
<p>The local foreign firm tea market has been stagnant for many days since the end of the general settlement. Recently, spring sales to Morocco have shown some activity, with various foreign firms shipping out a considerable amount of last year's purchased goods. Among them, companies like Xiehe and Yongxing have been actively replenishing their stocks of Drawn Core Zhen Mei green tea at low prices. Yesterday, tea warehouses like Hongyuan, Yonggong, Shengyong, and Yongxinglong sold over 300 boxes of Drawn Core tea from Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas. However, the selling price has dropped to 84-85 yuan, a decrease of five to six to eight yuan compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Little Change in Camel Wool Market Prices</h3>
<p>The red plate trading of wool fabrics and woolen cloth has mostly commenced, but due to tight credit, transactions are less frequent than in previous years. However, trade is smoother than in previous years, as those in the industry are aware of the high costs. Prices for old goods are slightly higher than before the Lunar New Year, by about twenty to thirty cents. Sets of goods have not moved yet due to excessive price increases. The opening prices for various camel wool items, including wide and narrow stripes, plain colors, and artistic designs, remain unchanged for the New Year's red plate trading. Weft Lun Tiger design still sells for 2.10 yuan, Tianxiang Crane design for 1.95 yuan, Wei Yi Two Deer design for 1.45 yuan, Dade Phoenix design for 1.30 yuan, and Guanghua Silver Elephant design for 0.95 yuan. Sales are brisk in the woolen cloth, silk satin, and foreign goods retail departments.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Bamboo Joint Steel Bars Are Hard to Sell</h3>
<p>Transactions of 40-foot long bamboo joint steel bars have become sluggish recently. The red plate increase of over ten yuan, requiring 130 yuan per ton, has dampened the appetite of construction firms. Furthermore, business from other merchants is limited due to tight lending by silver firms, leading many to observe the market without making purchases. As a result, the market is very quiet. Although those in the trade are making efforts to promote sales, the unfavorable environment makes it difficult. It is reported that only seventy to eighty tons have been transacted in the market since the day before yesterday, with prices ranging from 124 to 125 yuan, cheaper than the red plate by about four to five yuan. It is said that larger deals could potentially command lower prices.</p>
<h3>200 Bundles of Copper Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 200 bundles of Flag Brand copper were purchased by copper sheet factories at 50 yuan per bundle, slightly lower than the red plate price by two yuan. Transactions of this commodity have been quiet since the military factory ceased operations, and sales by outside merchants have been scarce, leading to a rather depressed market. The copper sheet factories' purchases offer hope for a market turnaround.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News, Haikou Rubber Red Plate Up Four Cents</h3>
<p>Haikou rubber (i.e., the raw material for rubber overshoes) has been in tight supply lately due to infrequent arrivals, and the market is tight. Only 25 pieces arrived the day before yesterday, and yesterday's red plate trading has opened up entirely. The price is 0.51 yuan per market pound, a rise of four cents. According to merchants' correspondence, the next shipment is not expected until late April or early May, highlighting the low inventory. Singaporean goods are of better quality and whiter color, with high-grade goods priced at 0.56 yuan and ordinary goods at 0.53 yuan. They are also selling quickly due to scarcity, with expectations of further price increases.</p>

<h3>What Kind of Person I Will Become in the Future</h3>
<p>— Lian Wenxiang, Sixth Grade, Wuchang No. 11 Elementary School</p>
<p>People's aspirations must be determined by the environment. Those who cannot adapt to the environment will inevitably be rejected by society. This is something that we young students should pay attention to. So, what kind of person will I become in the future?</p>
<p>In this critical time of national crisis, should I carry a gun, fight to the death to defend the country, "return in triumph as a national hero, die in battle as a national martyr"? Is it good to be a martyr who sacrifices for the country? I believe that the responsibility of defending the country should be borne by patriotic men, and we women do not need to overstep our bounds.</p>
<p>When a strong neighbor is pressing the border and the war of resistance is fierce, should men fight on the battlefield and women manage household affairs, doing the work of defending the rear? I feel that these things can be done by anyone with a little knowledge, and I am unwilling to do them.</p>
<p>My aspiration is to be an angel on the battlefield—Florence Nightingale. Today's China is like a mantis that has lost its power, trapped by a group of ants. The only way out is to resist the war. Once the war begins, my patriotic men will be bombarded by artillery shells, with broken arms and legs, groaning in pools of blood, unable to live or die. How tragic that would be! Even if there are rear hospitals, I am afraid that they will not be able to provide timely help. If the measures are slightly delayed, the losses will be uncountable. I will gather a large number of comrades to be responsible for front-line nursing. We will use our comfort to relieve their depression; we will use our sympathy to reduce their pain. This will allow the wounded to recover early and give comfort to the military. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>It is not that I do not want to emulate Lü Siniang in killing the enemy, but I have no one to teach me swordsmanship. It is not that I do not want to emulate Hua Mulan in quelling the bandits, but I regret that the government does not conscript female soldiers. As for the ladies who do not leave their boudoirs and the talented women who excel in poetry and prose, they are not suitable for the environment, nor are they needed at this time, and they are not what I want to do. What I want to do is to be an angel on the battlefield that adapts to the environment, benefits the country, and is within my power.</p>

<h3>A Successful Person</h3>
<p>— Xu Shouhe</p>
<p>Dear children: Among the many famous inventors in history, such as Edison's invention of the electric light and Watt's invention of the steam engine... you all know a lot about the big ones. Now, let's talk about an inventor who is also very helpful to us.</p>
<p>This person is called Gutenberg. He was a German who first made a living by grinding gemstones and making glasses. He opened an eyeglasses shop, but later closed it due to business losses. He then opened a printing shop, which is similar to what we now call a printing house.</p>
<p>Once, he printed a book for someone, and he had to engrave many, many plates. Because movable type had not been invented at that time, to print a book, he had to engrave a wooden plate. To print a book of more than a hundred pages, he had to engrave more than a hundred plates. Moreover, it could only be used to print this kind of book. If he wanted to print a different kind of book, he had to engrave another kind of plate. He thought: This is so troublesome and uneconomical. He used his brain and thought carefully, and as a result, he invented something that made printing books really fast and convenient. What is it? It turns out that it is what we now call movable type.</p>
<p>The method of making this movable type is to first make a mold of the character out of copper or other materials, and then pour molten lead into the mold. When it cools, pour out the lead, and it becomes individual lead characters. Using this method, you can make many different kinds of characters. Then, according to the manuscript, arrange them in order on the plate, and you can print the book. After printing, you can take the lead characters apart one by one and put them away. If you want to print another kind of book, you can rearrange them and print them again. In this way, you can save the effort of engraving plates every time, and if you put the arranged plates on a machine, you can print tens of thousands of words of books and newspapers in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Later, everyone imitated his example, which was really very convenient. So after he died, the people in his hometown even erected a monument to him to commemorate him.</p>
<h3>National Flag</h3>
<p>— Liu Yongqing</p>
<p>What a glorious and majestic national flag! Swaying in the breeze, flying in the sky, I saw it and my blood suddenly boiled and my spirits soared.</p>
<p>'Respected and beloved national flag! You are the sustenance of the soul of the country, you are the representative of the spirit of the nation. You bear a great responsibility to us, standing tremblingly in our China. You declare to the world for us: "This is Chinese territory. Whoever destroys peace and infringes on sovereignty, I will fight him to the death!"'</p>
<p>Chinese people! How can we strive for self-improvement in a way that is worthy of its enthusiasm?</p>
<h3>Sun</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>When the weather is severely cold, everyone likes this economical furnace - the sun. In Min'er's home, they don't light a stove because they don't have money. In fact, stoves are only harmful to us and not beneficial, while sunlight is of great benefit to us, so Min'er's family welcomes sunlight the most.</p>
<p>One day, Min'er and Cong'er were warming themselves in the sun. Min'er's body was getting hot from the sun, and she felt that this big furnace was very strange, so she opened her mouth and asked her brother:</p>
<p>"Brother, what exactly is inside the sun? How far away is it from our earth?"</p>
<p>"Before the 19th century (more than 1800 years), humans had no way of knowing the composition of the sun. Later, after a lot of hard work by astronomers, they invented a kind of spectroscopic analysis (which can infer what kind of substance it is from the light emitted by each gas). Using this method to check the light emitted by the sun, they knew that its composition is half the same as that of the earth, such as light gas, oxygen, carbon, tin, silver, copper, iron, lead, etc. However, nitrogen, gas, and phosphorus are not found in the sun. To know how far the sun is from the earth, you only need to see how far the moon is from the earth. The moon is considered to be very close to our earth, but it is actually 240,000 miles away. Humans have not yet been able to explore it. The sun is even further away from the earth. Saying it will scare you. I'm afraid you can't even write this number. How much is it? It's 92.9 million miles, 345 times greater than the distance between the moon and the earth. Let me give you another interesting analogy that will be even more surprising. Suppose a long-distance runner can run ten yards per second, and runs continuously, then he can run around the earth seven times a year. If he wants to run to the sun, it will take him 500 years to reach it, and then another 500 years to return to earth from the sun, for a total of 1,000 years. Isn't that surprising? This is just an ideal. Where is there such a long-lived human being?"</p>
<p>"Since it's so far away, wouldn't the heat from the sun cool down when it reaches the earth? Why do we all feel hot?"</p>
<p>"The temperature of the sun is extremely high, almost impossible to measure. The temperature on its surface is already between 6,000 and 7,000 degrees on the Celsius thermometer. The temperature inside it is unimaginable. The highest temperature that humans can create recently is only 3,800 degrees on the Celsius thermometer, which is only half the temperature of the sun's surface. The earth is one million times smaller than the sun, so the sun is just a speck of dust in the sky for the earth. Since it has such a high temperature, how can it be cold when it reaches the earth?"</p>
<p>After hearing these many words, Min'er felt the greatness of the sky.</p>
<h3>Simple Shuttlecock</h3>
<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>Cold winter! Shuttlecock is a very fashionable toy. Originally, shuttlecock is very beneficial for children, and it can also be said to be a noble entertainment for children. When it's cold, kicking the shuttlecock and running and jumping can not only warm you up immediately, but also has great benefits for your body.</p>
<p>The method of making a shuttlecock is to use a one-inch long goose feather tube and a copper coin, cut the end of the goose feather tube into prongs, connect it to the copper coin, wrap it with cloth, and then sew it with needle and thread. Then find a few colorful pheasant feathers from the tail of a rooster, insert them into the goose feather tube, and you have a shuttlecock! However, rooster feathers and goose feather tubes are not easy to find, so impatient children should make a paper shuttlecock. The method of making a paper shuttlecock is very simple. You just need to use a rectangular piece of white paper - of course, red paper, green paper, and colored paper are even better. Fold it lengthwise, and then use scissors to cut the two sides of the fold into thin strips, leaving seven or eight points uncut at the top. After cutting, unfold it and fold it horizontally, folding it into a square. Put a copper coin in the middle, wrap the copper coin with paper, and tie a few threads on the outside. This paper shuttlecock is ready! Children, why not give it a try?</p>
<p>There are many ways to kick a shuttlecock. There is front kicking, back kicking, kicking with both feet alternately, kicking to the back, kicking to the face, and even kicking to the nose. The names are crooked head, head top, foot top, and carrying across the river. There are really all kinds of tricks. Those who can kick not only can kick hundreds or thousands of times in a row, but also kick in a variety of ways, which is very interesting. However, this also requires daily practice. When you first kick, you can't kick many times and you can't kick well. So, children who are learning to kick shuttlecock should not be impatient. Slowly, you will naturally be able to kick more and kick better!</p>
<h3>1935</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>——Small Game One——</p>
<p>1935 has just passed, and 1936 is coming next. Children, everyone must still be a little reluctant to part with the past year.</p>
<p>Reluctant as you may be, Father Time has taken it away after all.</p>
<p>Now, in order to commemorate that year, let's hold an arithmetic game.</p>
<p>Children, aren't there nine Arabic numerals above? From O to S. Isn't there an addition equation below? Its answer is 1935. We have to put the nine Arabic numerals above, one by one, on those nine dotted lines, so that when they are added up, the answer is exactly 1935.</p>
<p>Children, please try it out. This is an interesting game.</p>
<p>If you can't figure it out, or the answer is wrong, then please look at the next issue of this publication, which has the correct answer.</p>
<h3>"Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha..."</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>——Small Game Two——</p>
<p>Children, there are many small things that we definitely think we can do, but when we try it, we can't do it no matter what. Isn't that very strange?</p>
<p>Today, I tore a piece of paper like the picture above, and asked my little brother to hold both sides with his hands, and asked him:</p>
<p>"I want you to tear down both sides. Can you do it?"</p>
<p>Without thinking, my little brother replied, "What's so difficult about that! You watch." As he said, he used force with both hands to tear towards both sides - only to hear a "hiss..." sound, but only the strip of paper on the right hand side was torn down (as shown in the picture below), and not a bit of the one on the left hand side was torn.</p>
<p>"Eh! Eh..." My little brother couldn't help but be surprised.</p>
<p>This interesting little game attracted many people to watch: Grandma, aunt, younger brother, cousin, all looked on with grinning mouths. They all asked me to let them try it. I tore up many pieces of paper in the style of the picture above and let them try them one by one.</p>
<p>Before trying, everyone's face showed a look of "I will definitely use force to tear them down, and tear down both sides", but what was the result? This person was half a catty, that person was eight ounces - no one could only tear down one side. So, the people who tried laughed, and the people who watched laughed too:</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha ha ha..."</p>
<p>Children who read the newspaper, after reading my article, why not try it too, and also ask your grandmother, aunt... to try it, to fill the house with laughter.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Entertain Poor Children</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>In the Christianity of various countries, every year on Jesus' birthday, several churches always hold a gathering for poor children. These churches start collecting donations from various church members two or three weeks in advance. It is of course good to donate a lot, but it is also good to donate ten cents or a few cents. There are even those who donate toys and candy. On Christmas Day, the churches gather the donations and items and entertain all the poor children. In this gathering, there is music, movies, lectures, dramas, and all kinds of noble entertainment that poor children usually do not have the opportunity to participate in. At the same time, there are also delicious refreshments. If the donations are sufficient, each person can also get a hearty dinner. When the meeting is over, each person can also get a bag of toys or candy.</p>
<p>In recent years, the churches in Shanghai have also done this. Although what they have done is inevitably somewhat religious, I think that the spirit of "universal love," "freedom," "equality," and "mutual assistance" of Christ is also indispensable for us children. Therefore, I am now making a special proposal to the children to gather the financial resources of all the children and take the initiative to hold it. Of course, holding it so occasionally is absolutely no help to the actual lives of poor children, but giving them such a day of entertainment in their poor lives is better than nothing. Because this kind of gathering, on the one hand, has the function of instructing them on proper entertainment methods, and on the other hand, it can also induce them to work hard to seek hope for improving their lives. Several world-famous great figures were born in poverty, so poor children only need to know how to work hard to improve themselves, and it will not be difficult to become good citizens in the future. At the same time, at this kind of gathering, the children and the poor children have close contact, and they can also understand the inside of the poor lives of many poor children.</p>
<p>Therefore, I now want to ask all the children to immediately take out a part of their savings, gather a huge amount of money, and entertain the poor children nearby, so that they can have a good day. The day does not necessarily have to be Christmas Day, or Sunday is also fine. During the gathering, everyone must eat, drink, laugh, and play without any restraint. Everyone, of course, must also bring a few toys to the meeting so that they can be distributed to poor children when the meeting is over. Best of all, I think the children may wish to each bring a few old cotton-padded jackets, cotton-padded trousers, hats, gloves, etc., and share them with the poor children, which is very meaningful in practice.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Righteous Dog (5)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Although Patrasche was a dog, he knew how to be grateful. Patrasche lay there thoughtfully, its solemn and gentle brown eyes watching the every move of its two friends.</p>
<p>But old Daas was too old after all. He couldn't do anything heavy to maintain his life, he could only trudge along pushing a small wooden cart, delivering milk to the cattle-raising neighbors in the village of Antwerp every day.</p>
<p>The neighbors hired him to do this small job partly out of pity for him, and largely because he was diligent and faithful. There was no one more suited to deliver milk. When he came back after delivering the milk, they asked him to look after the gardens, fields, and their cattle and chickens. But these jobs were also very laborious for old Daas. Because he was already eighty-three years old, and Antwerp was far away, three or four miles away.</p>
<p>On Patrasche's first day of recovery, it lay peacefully in the warm sunshine with a small wreath of chrysanthemums around its neck, watching the milk cans being carried back and forth.</p>
<p>The next morning, before old Daas moved his little cart, Patrasche got up first and walked over, placing its body between the two cart handles, indicating that it was willing to work to repay their kindness. Old Daas was very unwilling. He thought it was a disgrace to force dogs to do work that they were not fit for.</p>
<p>But Patrasche refused to accept his kindness. When it saw that they were not harnessing it to the cart, it tried to drag the cart forward with its teeth.</p>
<p>In the end, old Daas gave in. He was moved by Patrasche's sincerity. He modified the two handles of the cart so that Patrasche could pull in the middle without much effort. From then on, every morning it happily did this work.</p>
<p>When winter came, old Daas was very grateful for his good fortune in running into this sick dog in the ditch in the Luofan area and rescuing it; because he was very old, and his body was weakening year by year. If he hadn't had Patrasche pulling so many milk cans for him every day, running in the snow and mud, he didn't know how he would have coped.</p>

<h3>The Coal Gasoline Industry in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Depei</p>
<p>As the war crisis intensifies daily, the demand for raw materials for military and public works industries around the world is also increasing. Therefore, countries around the world are paying special attention to raw material planning, as evidenced by the gradual concretization of Germany's artificial rubber factory construction plan. However, among these, the development of the coal liquefaction oil industry is most noteworthy; this has led to the phenomenon of countries like Germany and England striving for self-sufficiency in gasoline.</p>
<p>Gasoline is a type of volatile oil derived from coal liquefaction, and it is an important fuel for engines. The latest method for extracting gasoline was invented twenty years ago by Dr. Bergius of Germany. Currently, the factory of Germany's IG Farben uses this new method to produce 100,000 tons of liquefied gasoline annually to supply fuel for automobiles. In October of the year before last, Germany also established the "Brown Coal Gasoline Company" with a capital of 100 million marks, which can produce 250,000 tons of liquefied gasoline annually.</p>
<p>Originally, the United States produced 16.7 billion gallons of gasoline annually, but one-third of it was manufactured using the ordinary Krack Process. With this ordinary method, only 50% of pure gasoline can be extracted from crude oil. Conversely, using the Bergius method, 100% of the gasoline can be extracted from crude oil. Therefore, since 1930, the United States has gradually decided to abandon the Krack Process and adopt the new Bergius method to manufacture gasoline.</p>
<p>The only country whose petroleum resources can be compared to the United States is England. However, England only began producing liquefied raw materials from coal in 1929; and it was only since April of last year that the development of this matter as a new industry attracted the world's attention. In April of last year, England's largest Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) built a large liquefied oil manufacturing plant in Billingham, the result of which will bring a major revolution to the petroleum industry. As for the manufacturing method of this Billingham plant, it is based on Dr. Bergius' method, and after many years of experiments, it has been modified according to the characteristics of British coal.</p>
<p>The newly established liquefaction plant of Imperial Chemical Industries in Billingham requires at least 3 million pounds in construction costs. The operation of this plant is divided into two parts: one is to directly manufacture gasoline from coal; the other is due to ICI's agreement with the "Low Temperature Carbonization Company," which supplies a large amount of Grooste oil and bitumen, from which gasoline is then extracted. From these direct and indirect liquefaction of gasoline, the Billingham plant consumes 500,000 tons of coal annually. For the production of this coal, 1,950 miners are needed each year, and the liquefaction plant also has 1,000 workers, totaling nearly 3,000 people. The liquefied gasoline produced by this plant is sold on the market through Anglo-American Oil Company, British Petroleum Company, and Shell Mex Company.</p>
<p>This Billingham plant can produce 45 million gallons of gasoline annually. In addition, the gasoline originally manufactured by the British National Gasoline Company and various industries as by-products amounts to 45 million to 50 million gallons, so England actually produces 90 million to 100 million gallons of gasoline annually.</p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain accurate figures for the production cost of England's liquefied gasoline. According to general rumors and speculations, the lowest production cost is approximately seven pence per gallon. If this is the case, then the selling value of domestically produced liquefied oil in England is one shilling and half pence per gallon. In comparison, the price of foreign oil in gasoline stores throughout England is currently one shilling and half pence per gallon. Under such competitive conditions, it is possible that more attempts to manufacture liquefied gasoline will continue to emerge in England, and existing plants such as the Billingham plant may certainly develop. Thus, it is perhaps becoming a reality that England's domestically produced gasoline can supply most of its total needs. But this is only "perhaps," and it is not necessarily inevitable. Because to manufacture gasoline, without constructing large-scale factories, the production cost will certainly not be low, and the construction of large-scale factories requires a large amount of capital. However, under the current circumstances in England, it is very difficult to use a large amount of capital to construct large factories for manufacturing gasoline. At the same time, the production cost of gasoline is greatly related to the market price of oil, but the future world oil market price is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>When the Billingham plant was completed, the British military had high expectations for it from a strategic point of view. They thought that in the event of an emergency, they could obtain the necessary fuel from abundant domestically produced coal without relying on imported gasoline. The British Air Force currently uses 6.5 million gallons of gasoline annually, and last year it was decided to greatly expand the Air Force plan, so it is expected that the amount of gasoline needed in the future will increase substantially. In this way, under the need to expand military equipment and prepare for war, the future development prospects of the British gasoline industry are certainly present; however, whether it can achieve the ideal of self-sufficiency is still a question.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Germany is the pioneer of the coal liquefaction oil industry. A hundred years ago, Germany had already effectively treated brown coal, which had little use value, through immature technology and low-temperature carbonization methods. Afterwards, research continued, and twenty years ago, Dr. Bergius' new method, which became the basis of the current coal liquefaction methods used by various countries, emerged. However, the progress of Germany's coal liquefaction industry has been relatively slow. The reason is that the raw material that Germany relies on is mainly brown coal, and the production cost of its liquefaction industry is also very high.</p>
<p>According to investigations, the petroleum import values of England, Germany, and Japan in recent years are as follows:</p>
<p>From this statistic, we can see that Germany needs a huge amount of petroleum every year. Such a lack of domestically produced petroleum is of course most unfavorable to national defense. Although the German government has encouraged oil exploration with huge subsidies, the weak domestic oil fields ultimately have no hope of achieving independent petroleum autonomy. Therefore, the only path for Germany at present is to strive for coal liquefaction.</p>
<p>In October of the year before last, the German government established the Brown Coal Gasoline Company with a capital of 100 million marks to carry out a large-scale plan to extract petroleum from abundant domestically produced brown coal. Recently, the company is planning to build a large factory. After this project is completed, it will be able to extract 200,000 tons of automobile gasoline annually from brown coal. At the same time, existing factories are also being expanded, and the entire country is enthusiastic about petroleum self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Notice: To Messrs. Zheng Yi, Shou He, Cheng, Pu Yu, Shi, Xiao Tian, Xu Qing, Da, Si Ruo: We are deeply grateful for your generous contributions in January! The manuscript fees have been settled clearly. Please bring your receipt with the seal to the accounting department of this newspaper from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day from the 6th to the 10th, and from the 16th to the 20th of each month (except Sundays) to receive payment. (The Editorial Department of Shen Bao Amateur Weekly)</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Germany's Leuna plant can currently only produce 100,000 tons of liquefied gasoline annually, it is planning to be able to produce 350,000 tons annually. The investors of the Brown Coal Gasoline Company are also planning to increase production to 1.25 million tons annually. If this becomes a reality, then Germany's petroleum self-sufficiency will not be a dream. However, the current production cost is still very high. If it can be liquefied from coal in the future, perhaps this production cost can still be reduced due to the high-priced sale of its by-products.</p>
<p>In addition, countries such as Belgium, France, and Spain have also recently been working hard on the coal liquefaction industry, and all have achieved significant results. Naturally, strictly speaking, the coal liquefaction oil industry has not yet emerged from its infancy, but due to the full attention of various countries, astonishing progress is bound to appear in the near future: It is because of military needs that governments of all countries must plan to develop the coal liquefaction industry. In this way, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the so-called war for petroleum resources and the fierce competition for petroleum liquefaction are about to spread extensively. As evidenced by the recent war between England and Italy, and even the United States, for the petroleum resources of Abyssinia, this is a realistic proof.</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand People Visit the Esperanto Exhibition Amidst the Flying Green Stars</h3>
<p>— Ms. Aifeiye</p>
<p>In the New Year, everything before my eyes has undergone drastic changes, and even my mental state seems to have undergone a special transformation; I am clearly a year older, but for some reason, my spirits have been more excited these past few days than usual, as if I feel younger than before: my hair is permed into waves, and my face is covered with snow cream and rouge, and I am just spinning around like a revolving lantern. Melon seed shells, bridge tile skins, and cigarette ash are scattered all over the room. Ladies and gentlemen, dandies, come and go. Wine, sex, meat, fragrance, mahjong, all set up their mesmerizing arrays, surrounding themselves tightly, giving themselves the strongest kind of anesthesia. The unlucky ones are the row of Esperanto books on the desk, which have temporarily declared themselves unemployed these few days, hiding crookedly in the corner of the room, dozing off, perhaps dreaming of Zamenhof!</p>
<p>Saying "excitement" is it not actually an unconscious reaction in my spirit? Isn't it a synonym for "decadence"? True, my heart is as clear as glass, national affairs never escape my notice, and I may know world affairs more clearly than others, but sometimes, a gust of wind blows from somewhere, and it actually covers my heart with a cloud, a layer of dust. Only Esperanto, it often quietly climbs into my heart, holding high the banner of pragmatism, sweeping away this cloud and dust all at once.</p>
<p>I am already a woman over thirty years old, a woman who has lost her youth and lacks the courage to struggle, the loneliest woman in a lonely country. People are gradually abandoning me, many energetic young people have forgotten me, the whole world is shutting its doors to reject me, there is almost no one kind in front of me, and it seems that there are only enemies behind me. Only Esperanto, it still kisses me passionately from time to time, encouraging me; when the black shadow of disappointment sweeps past me, it scatters countless beautiful flowers from the green constellations, bringing me some news of the blessed from the heavenly kingdom of reality. Only Esperanto is the "great lover" that people will always cherish, and only in contacting Esperanto, using Esperanto, can you recognize the true truth, and only in this can you find millions of living Gods and be with them.</p>
<p>So, on the fourth day of the New Year, I finally went to the Chinese Esperanto Bookstore on Carter Road with a spirit that was both "excited" and "decadent," with a mood that was both "busy" and "bored," to admire the entire face of Esperanto.</p>
<p>The venue of this third Esperanto exhibition has two locations, each occupying one room. The first venue is downstairs in the bookstore, and the second venue is on the second floor. When I went in, both venues were crowded with people. It is said that no less than four or five thousand people have visited in the past two days. The venue is full of huge slogans: some written in Chinese, and some in Esperanto, and the Chinese can be divided into two types: Chinese characters and new writing. Here are a few excerpts of the slogans respectively, so that readers can get a glimpse of them (the author has translated those written in Esperanto and new writing into Chinese characters for the convenience of typesetting):</p>
<p>Written in Esperanto - "Use Esperanto to liberate China"</p>
<p>Written in new writing - "Esperanto is a tool that enables Chinese people to participate in international culture"</p>
<p>Written in Chinese characters - "To speak for tens of millions of people, one should use the universal language 'Esperanto.' My works are only complete when they are translated into Esperanto - Barbusse." "Conservatives insist that Esperanto is a utopian attempt, but the reality that progresses gradually according to the laws always more firmly negates these conservative views - Gorky"</p>
<p>The purpose of holding an exhibition is to exhibit, and slogans are not its main content, so now we should turn our heads and take a look at what it is displaying:</p>
<p>Esperanto books - There are more than 30,000 Esperanto books in the world (countless unknown ones), which is an astonishing number for a brief history of fifty years. In terms of content, teaching materials and literary works are the most numerous, followed by social sciences, and natural sciences are fewer. It is said that what is displayed this time is limited to those sold by the bookstore, purchased by the library, and collected by private individuals, totaling about seven hundred kinds. Among them, the more famous ones include "The Original Works of Zamenhof," "The Inspector General," "The Collection of Proverbs," "Andersen's Fairy Tales," Shakespeare's "Hamlet," and other famous works translated by Zamenhof, the world-translated versions of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "The Road Back," and "The Key to Esperanto" explained in various different languages. There are also many Chinese masterpieces that have been translated into Esperanto, such as Qu Shengbai's translation of the "Three Principles of the People," Zhong Xianmin's translation of Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," and translations of the "Analects," "Great Learning," and "Classic of Filial Piety." In addition, there is "The Buddhist Amitabha Sutra" translated by Japanese Nohara Kyuichi, which is said to be the most unique in Esperanto books of this kind. As for dictionaries, the one that should be mentioned here is "The Esperanto-English Dictionary" compiled by Edward A. Millidge, which is the richest in compound words. If we talk about the large number of single words, then the first to be recommended is Japanese Ishiguro Osamu's "Japanese-World Dictionary." In addition, "Modern Chinese Esperanto Dictionary" and "Model Dictionary of Esperanto Chinese Characters, Regular and Supplementary Volumes" are also good editions.</p>
<p>Esperanto magazines - At least 500 Esperanto magazines are regularly published around the world. Although on the "quality" side, there is a lack of large-scale Esperanto magazines, on the "quantity" side, it exceeds the magazines published in their own languages by most countries. It is said that what is displayed here is limited to the scope of exchange. There are about two hundred kinds from foreign countries. The most valuable ones include "Literary World," "Our Magazine," "Scientific Magazine," "Proletarian Literature," "On the Outpost," "Practical Esperanto," and "Pirate." Those with particularly unique content or form include the organ of the Czech Blind Esperanto Association, "Dawn," as well as publications on Catholic life and the Japanese Omoto-kyo. There are also magazines specifically for children and our girls. As for domestic Esperanto magazines, there are also fifty or sixty kinds. For example, Shanghai, Shanxi, Yunnan, Chengdu, Nanning, Suzhou, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Wenzhou, Beiping, Hankou and other places have the publication of Esperanto magazines. Needless to say, the "World Monthly" published in Shanghai is considered the "eldest son" among them. There is also the Shen Bao Amateur Weekly Esperanto Research Special Issue published two years ago, which is also on display there, with a total of three issues, totaling 50,000 words.</p>
<p>Esperanto correspondence from various countries - The countries that communicate with Chinese Esperantists include the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, England, the United States, the Soviet Union, Spain, etc. The correspondence materials are mostly printed out on a typewriter, and these materials are not limited to text. There are also Australian plant specimens sent by foreign Esperantists, and postcards, photos, and beautifully printed slogans, advertisements, stamps, postcards, etc. exchanged in Esperanto. The nature of these postcards and photos can be divided into two types: one is to describe the customs and culture of various parts of the world, such as "Medieval Roman Catholic Church," "House built in Sweden in the 12th century,"... these are all worth seeing; one is about the new construction of the Soviet Union, such as "Industrial University," "Soil Washing Factory," "Steamboat on Lake Lenin," "Dnjepro's new crane," etc. As for slogans, the Austrian slogans against smoking are the most shocking. One of them, if translated into Chinese, would be "Tobacco prepares you for a path to tuberculosis." The reporter had just lit a cigarette at that time, and when I saw this terrifying advertisement, I hesitated for a while, but in an instant, that cigarette was finally sent to my mouth! As for stamps, the reporter is not a stamp king, and has always been an amateur in this field, so I don't want to talk about it too much here, but there is a "Manchukuo Enthronement Commemorative" stamp, which is indeed the first time I have seen it, and I have gained some knowledge this year.</p>
<p>Others - Others include "Esperanto Travel Guides" of famous cities around the world, Esperanto maps of China, Europe, and Groningen in the Netherlands, and various photos taken by members of the Shanghai Esperanto Association when traveling to Songjiang, Wusong, Suzhou, and Ye Garden in Jiangwan. Regarding domestic and foreign Esperanto organizations, there are photos of the first Esperanto Exhibition, as well as photos of the first, second, and fourth congresses of the Shanghai Esperanto Association and many other domestic and foreign Esperanto organizations. Regarding the temporary teaching of Esperanto, there is an Esperanto Simplified Course at the exhibition, which is attached to the venue, and the teaching method adopts the direct method. Anyone who comes to visit and wants to learn Esperanto can be taught individually. In addition, there are Esperanto calendars, Esperanto grammar charts, etc., and because of space limitations, they will not be described in detail here.</p>
<p>I came out of the venue with a few Esperanto booklets given away by the exhibition, and met Miss Luo, the campus belle of a certain university, on the road.</p>
<p>"Miss Hui, where did you go just now? I've been looking for you for a long time, and when I called your house, they said you weren't there."</p>
<p>"I went to the Esperanto exhibition on Carter Road."</p>
<p>"What is there to see in Esperanto? Let's go see a movie! Have you seen Claudette Colbert's "The Gilded Lily"? It's said to be very good, I'll treat."</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>Recently, for some reason, my tongue has been so worn out that I can no longer utter even a firm word, let alone impassioned words! I wanted to say "no," but my tongue said "okay"; I wanted to step onto the podium of justice, but my tongue was always hesitant. My heart is as clear as crystal, but my muscles are as numb as if they have passed through an electric current. I felt paralysis all over: my hand could not open the dark window, my eyes were always confused, unable to struggle, I could not hear the sound of artillery in the borderlands, I could not see the raging fire thousands of miles away, and I could not smell a trace of the atmosphere of the masses. Really, a woman over thirty is already useless! Although the green star is shining in my arms, and although I carry a truth, a weapon for national liberation - Esperanto, but what use is this to me?</p>
<p>"...Even if the burden is as heavy as a mountain, the road to freedom will soon be completed..." Miss Luo walked along, humming "The Road Song" in a low voice with a playful attitude.</p>
<p>"I can't keep up with the times, I'm about to decline!" My heart sighed like this, and tears hung down my face.</p>
<p>Special Discussion</p>
<h3>The Path to Chinese Cultural Construction</h3>
<p>— Lin Zhuwu</p>
<p>China's culture is currently undergoing rapid change, a fact that everyone acknowledges. Our culture is Eastern in style, with a long history of influence. However, with the intrusion of Western culture, the old school despises it, while the new school distorts it. This aversion varies in intensity: those with a deep aversion view Western culture as venomous snakes and fierce beasts, believing that contact with it will lead to national peril; those with a superficial aversion say that Western culture is nothing extraordinary, as our ancient texts already contain similar ideas. Distortion also varies in intensity: those with a deep distortion blindly follow everything Western, making no distinctions, wearing only Western clothes, teaching only Christianity, and wishing they could magically transform into blue-eyed, blonde-haired beings; those with a superficial distortion advocate a so-called blending of Chinese and Western elements, wearing long gowns with Western trousers, having civilized weddings with traditional kowtowing. We will not discuss the two extremes due to their stubbornness and blind adherence. However, the two more moderate approaches are worth discussing, as they permeate all of China. Whether they are correct or beneficial remains to be considered. If correct and beneficial, they can serve as paths to construction; if incorrect and not beneficial, they should be corrected and made beneficial, which is also a path to construction. Our perspective in this discussion is based on the seven words: "The needs of this time and place."</p>
<p>What are the needs of this time and place? In a word: "Science." In this century, in this world, science holds the power. A country without science cannot survive. China is situated in the 20th-century world of science, and it must rapidly develop science. Science has no national boundaries. We cannot say that because it succeeded in the West, we, as an Eastern nation, do not need Western science. Science is universal. Speaking of "foreign," "Western," or "external" reveals an excessively academic mindset. The question arises: Are there no scientific ideas in our ancient books? Yes, there are, and many. Then why not use "domestic" science? Guan Yinzi said: "Stone striking stone produces light, thunder and lightning are born of green energy, and this can be used." This is electricity. Mozi said: "Transformation, evidence of change. Like turtles turning into quails." This is chemistry. Zhou Li (The Rites of Zhou): "First exchange, second exchange, third exchange, managed by those who handle grass people and rice people." This is agronomy. Zhong Yong (The Doctrine of the Mean): "The greatness of mountains leads to prosperity through their treasures." This is mining. Furthermore, Zuo Zhuan (Zuo Commentary): "Scholars pass on words, commoners gossip, merchants trade, artisans present their skills." Thus, there is a need for newspapers. Da Xue (The Great Learning): "Producing wealth is a great undertaking, those who do it quickly succeed." Thus, there is a need for roads, rivers... [text unclear]... calling out loudly, the monument of South America was erected by the Chinese. The Chinese are truly great, but besides the Ah Q spirit, most are poisoned by the alcohol of history. Don't European scientists and philosophers greatly admire Greek culture? They might retort in this way. My answer is: admiration is admiration, but it should not lead to intoxication and loss of self, forgetting the need for creation. Ancient scientific insights only deserve a place in museums; they cannot be applied. Since science has succeeded in the West, should we rely on Mozi's fragmented statements and unsystematic ideas as chemistry, or should we rely on entire Western treatises with systematic and well-founded academic principles? Are Guan Yinzi's electrical theories better than Faraday's? Which is more applicable? You certainly understand. Therefore, the nonsense about "ancient books containing science" should cease.</p>
<p>As for the blending of Chinese and Western elements, our critique is as follows. Since science is a need of this time and place, we should embrace it without Chinese and Western blending. Reading a geology book that doesn't mention China's geology is like reading it in vain; an agronomy book that doesn't discuss transforming Chinese agriculture is a waste of paper. But should we blend Chinese and Western elements in things other than science? I believe we should, but we should choose what is universal, beneficial, and convenient. Using a fountain pen to write Chinese characters is convenient, using a phonograph to replace and improve Chinese music is beneficial, and using the Latin alphabet to spell Chinese should be a step towards globalization. We should strive to develop these things. Independent cultural patterns should be preserved, but if they hinder the survival and progress of the nation, they can be changed. We believe that such transformations are very beneficial.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we must have discerning eyes. Western things that are bad should be rejected, because bad Western culture can lead to national degeneration. The nude dances of Paris and the alcoholism of old Russia should be rejected.</p>
<p>There is another type of Western culture that does not lead to national degeneration and is welcomed by some. We can allow it to be free. Wearing Western clothes and eating Western food should not be prohibited nor encouraged. Let each follow their own preferences. Moreover, the progress of the times will reveal their consequences and destinies.</p>
<p>In this way, the path to constructing Chinese culture in a time of change can have the following four aspects:</p>
<p>Science should absolutely adopt from the West.</p>
<p>For things other than science, if they are universal, beneficial, and convenient, they can be adopted or blended.</p>
<p>Western things that are bad should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Things that can be free, should be free.</p>
<p>Shaking one's head and chanting "Confucius said," or constantly saying "I love you, darling," are all obstacles on the path of Chinese culture and must be swept away completely.</p>
<p>Art Scene</p>
<h3>### Comedians and Leading Men</h3>
<p>— Mingru</p>
<p>As a child, I had many opportunities to watch plays, and over time, it became a habit. If I didn't go to the theater for two days, although I wouldn't yawn or have a runny nose like a smoker craving a cigarette, I would feel strangely itchy inside. However, I wasn't a true "theater fan" because I didn't have an unconditional love for all types of plays. For example, I always found "plays of righteousness" that preached filial piety and loyalty to the emperor quite annoying. On the other hand, I wished for a scene from "Killing the Fish Family" or "Li Kui's Riot in Jiangzhou." This wasn't because I was naturally chaotic, but because the former was too monotonous, while the latter was more exciting.</p>
<p>However, what I enjoyed watching the most were the ribald plays performed by comedians and courtesans, because their forms and movements were so peculiar and strange, and their witty remarks were so humorous and amusing, that they could easily make me laugh and satisfy my tastes, so I welcomed them. But I didn't want to be assigned as a comedian myself, I wanted to be a leading man, because I instinctively realized that leading men were noble figures, while comedians were lowlifes. However, I didn't quite understand the strict difference between comedians and leading men: what kind of person is considered a leading man? What kind of person is assigned as a comedian? Although my elders had explained to me that leading men are upright in their behavior and have a bright heart, like Guan Yu, Yue Fei, and others, later generations respect them as leading men, while comedians are despicable in their behavior and have evil hearts, like Qin Hui, who are assigned as comedians. At first, I somewhat believed this, but later, upon reflection, it wasn't entirely true. If comedians truly represent "villains," then Zhang Yi, who makes a living fishing in the "Mengjin River," and the boys and girls in "Little Shepherd," all live honest lives fulfilling their duties, and they haven't lost their innocent childlike spirits. How can they be called despicable and treacherous, and why are they made into comedians? Also, for example, Wu Dalang in "Catching the Adulterer" was originally a simple vendor. He became a "cuckold" against his will, and his wife wasn't a natural adulteress, but was forcibly taken. When I watched this play, I felt very sorry for Wu Dalang. A person with a humble profession, even wanting to marry a beautiful wife, is coveted and seized by local bullies and villains. How infuriating! And yet on stage, he is made to look ugly and foolish, full of jokes, to amuse people and make them laugh. What is the purpose of this? Therefore, I have great doubts about the idea that "despicable behavior and evil hearts" represent comedians. At the same time, I noticed that on the stage, the so-called leading men are all kings, lords, and wealthy gentlemen, while peddlers, herdsmen, constables, and jailers almost all have painted faces and are assigned as comedians. Are the behaviors and hearts of these people all despicable and treacherous? On the contrary, people like Liu Bang and Chen Ping were originally local bullies and rascals in the marketplace. Although they later established some "achievements," these achievements were all individualistic and achieved through deceit. Logically, their faces should be painted and they should be assigned as comedians, but instead, they are revered as leading men. Therefore, I understood at the time that the leading men on the stage are not necessarily "upright in behavior and bright in heart," but are simply respected and praised because of their powerful influence. And the so-called comedians are not truly "despicable in behavior and evil in heart," but are simply despised because of their humble professions!</p>
<p>As I grew older and gained more knowledge, I slowly realized that the early stages of traditional opera were originally entertainment for the palace. The so-called kings, lords, and wealthy gentlemen, after being well-fed and warmly clothed, had no legitimate work to pass the long days and needed to come up with more ways to amuse themselves. After becoming bored with various amusements, they ordered scholars to fabricate stories and assign people to perform them. The stories had to be ugly, and the characters in the plays had to be ugly, in order to stimulate their numb brains. But the ugliness couldn't be directly drawn from their own palaces and mansions, and the makeup couldn't be applied to their own faces. Thus, the tragic stories of the common people were adapted by scholars into lewd and grotesque dramas, and the kind men and women in the tragic stories were transformed into cunning and eccentric comedians. Therefore, the leading men on the stage are the kings and lords themselves, and the comedians are the common people! The claim that comedians represent "villains" is all a facade, although there may be one or two exceptions.</p>

<h3>Humanity and Mountains</h3>
<p>— Mei Ping</p>
<p>Humanity not only lives in society, but also in nature. Therefore, natural phenomena such as rivers, deserts, and mountains have a very close relationship with humanity. When humanity did not yet have the ability to understand and thus conquer many phenomena of the natural world, they naturally dared not to explore the vast and unknowable deserts, the boundless oceans, and the great and magnificent high mountains and lofty peaks, and viewed them with amazement and a highly mystical perspective. In fact, in the mythological age of the past, all of humanity, both Chinese and foreign, considered famous mountains and great rivers to be the dwelling places of deities and worshiped them as deities. For example, in the past, some emperors, nobles, and refined gentlemen often loved to go to some seaside or some great mountain to seek immortals and learn from immortals; also, many myths and mythological novels depicted the dwelling places of gods and monsters mostly in mountainous peaks and by the sea: these kinds of facts are sufficient to fully demonstrate the relationship between humanity and mountains, rivers, etc. in the past, and to demonstrate humanity's understanding of mountains, rivers, etc. at that time. However, in modern society, with the development of industry and natural science, humanity not only knows that mountains, rivers, etc. have no mystical nature, but can also explore and conquer them. However, what is usually known is only things like how humanity uses ships to conquer the vast oceans, and how humanity uses airplanes to conquer the endless skies; it seems that very few people have talked about the experience of humanity exploring high mountains and strange peaks, and about the conquest of humanity of mountains, and these are what we are going to talk about here now.</p>
<p>In past China, because it was closed off to the outside world, most people simply didn't know about the world outside of China, and of course, they didn't know about the great mountains outside of China. "Confucius climbed Mount Dong and thought Lu was small, climbed Mount Tai and thought the world was small": this is sufficient to show what the largest mountain that the Chinese people saw in the past was like. But in the global sense, Mount Tai is not enough to be called a great mountain, and even China's Five Great Mountains are not enough to be called high and large; they are all very easy to climb, and there is simply no need to explore or conquer them. The mountains that we are talking about now that humanity has continuously striven to explore are the high mountains of the world, up to one or two, or even two or three, thousand feet, and are not the ordinary so-called "great mountains" that we can easily climb.</p>
<p>Let's start with Europe. In Europe, the earliest object of mountaineering was, needless to say, the Alps. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many poets, writers, and scientists such as Da Vinci, Rousseau, and Tennyson went to venture and explore this largest mountain in Europe, so people called this time the dawn of climbing the Alps. But in Europe, the so-called epoch-making mountaineering was the conquest of the Mont Blanc peak in the mid-18th century.</p>
<p>Mont Blanc is the highest peak in Europe, with a height of fifteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-two feet. The conquest of this peak was very difficult to succeed at first because of the dangerous roads and the power of the climate; it was not until 1786 that a man named Paccard and his guide Balmat reached the summit. After this magnificent success, many more climbers and explorers appeared, and soon almost all the high peaks of the Alps were conquered. So in 1857, the British Alpine Club first announced its establishment, and then between 1862 and 1874, the Alpine Clubs of Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, France, etc. were also established one after another. Therefore, the 19th century was called the Golden Age of Alpine mountaineering.</p>
<p>In the era when Alpine mountaineering was popular, the most brilliant historical record of mountaineers was the conquest of the Matterhorn. According to legend, this peak was the dwelling place of monsters, so the nearby residents were very afraid of it and dared not go to explore it. It was not until the arrival of the Golden Age of Alpine mountaineering that a young man came to the Alps for the purpose of travel sketching, harboring the ambition to conquer the Matterhorn. This young man, named Whymper, made eight resolute attacks on the Matterhorn between 1861 and 1865 before finally conquering it. But this success was quite difficult, and the result was a tragedy.</p>
<p>Originally, when Whymper began to conquer the Matterhorn, that is, in his so-called virginal conquest, no one came to compete with him. Later, however, the Italian Carrel was unwilling to let people from other countries take away this achievement, and repeatedly competed with him for credit. Moreover, in the end, Carrel went along with the mountaineering team of the Italian Alpine Club, wanting to carry out the ascent without Whymper's knowledge. When Whymper found out about this, he of course immediately ran to compete, starting to climb from the east, which led to a mountaineering competition between the Italians and the British. The result? The British youth Whymper won, and he reached the highest peak; but on the way down the mountain, due to the fault of a fellow traveler, four people fell down. The result only made him feel the victory of a few hours ago and quietly descend the mountain.</p>
<p>Secondly, a world-famous mountaineering feat occurred in South America. As everyone knows, the Andes Mountains of South America are the longest mountain range in the world. This mountain range stretches from the Isthmus of Panama in the north to Cape Horn in the south, with a length of eight million meters, and is recognized as a strange mountain range that runs through the South American continent. It has twenty thousand mountains and dozens of high peaks, and all the conditions are no less than those of the Alps.</p>
<p>The first peak to be conquered in the Andes was Chimborazo. This peak is as high as twenty thousand four hundred and ninety-eight feet, and the person who conquered it was also Whymper, who conquered the Matterhorn. It is directly under the equator, but the climate is very cold, and it is covered in heavy snow all year round, and Whymper and his team did not have ice skates at the time, so it was extremely difficult to proceed; at the same time, because it is on the top of Cotopaxi, the highest active volcano in the world, the heat underground is very strong in such cold air, and it can even melt the tree gum underground; such a strange phenomenon was of course something that even Whymper, who had explored high mountains, had never experienced before. But due to his arduous struggle, from December 1879 to January of the following year, he finally conquered this Chimborazo peak.</p>
<p>But the highest peak in South America is Aconcagua (twenty-two thousand eight hundred and thirty-four feet high), which was conquered in 1896 by the expedition team of the famous British mountaineer Fitzgerald. It is said that in conquering this peak, they repeatedly climbed to places as high as about twenty thousand feet, but were turned back by the obstruction of wind, snow, and cold air; although they finally achieved success, only the Alpine guide Zurbriggen and the geologist Vines reached the top, and Fitzgerald himself did not go up. Just from this point of view, it can be seen that conquering Aconcagua Peak was indeed quite difficult.</p>
<p>At the same time, that is, in the period from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, the highest peak on the African continent, Mount Kilimanjaro (nineteen thousand seven hundred and seventeen feet high), the second peak, Mount Kenya (seventeen thousand two hundred feet high), and the third peak, Mount Ruwenzori, have all been conquered one after another. Now, the only thing left is the Himalayas.</p>
