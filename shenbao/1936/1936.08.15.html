<p>時評</p>
<h3>有田外相的外交報吿</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>日本有田外相十一日在閣議席上。把當前的外交政策詳細說明了一番。他那美妙的外交辭令。分析起來。不外下列幾點。（一）竭力要和緩對英國和對蘇聯的直接衝突。（二）以中國為第一目標的大陸政策必須積極推進。而在華北設立「理想區域」的計晝尤其必須實現。（三）竭力要防止中蘇關係的親密。（四）以武力為外交的後盾。</p>
<p>我們從這里一些也看不出日本對華政策的新變化來。可是這一篇演辭郤充分地反映着日英衝突的尖銳化。日本對蘇聯的戒心。以及國際軍備競爭在日本國內所造成的危機。</p>
<p>日本從九一八以後。一向抱着虛驕的心理。它為要獨占東亞。不情拋棄了先前的好友英國。為要討取國際帝國主義者的歡心。不惜虛張聲勢。以進攻蘇聯的急先鋒自任。可是到了現在。英日在遠束的利害衝突已經尖銳到無可調和。而英國對華的經濟援助。和對蘇聯的携手。尤其使日本深感到自身的孤立。至於蘇聯。則已經把遠東軍備擴張到驚人的程度。這也使日本在軍備競爭上。應付不了。因此日本重新感覺到改善對英蘇兩國關係的重要。外交當局也就不得不在這方面來努力一下。</p>
<p>然而日本外交當局這一種努力。在傳統的對華政策繼續着的期間。恐怕也是徒然的罷。因為日英和日蘇的邦交所以惡化的根本原因。顯然就在那一套傳統的政策。</p>
<p>從有田外相的演辭看來。日本是不會放棄它那傳統的對華政策的。他提示着要實現在華北設立「理想區域」的計畫。這計晝是怎樣的呢。我們從最近蒙偽軍李守信部兩次進攻綏東陶林縣境的事實。也許可以得到些具體的認識。</p>
<p>李守信部是日本軍官所編練的。這支偽軍備有新式的坦克大砲。也是日軍所供給的。雖然兩次進犯了綏東。都經傅作義的部隊擊退了。然而察北日軍還在趕築着汽車路和飛機塲。冀束和熱河的偽軍也正向察北一帶開去。綏東的危機只有一天天的加緊起來。</p>
<p>日本顯然利用了蒙匪和偽軍要在地廣人稀的內蒙建立起又一傀儡組織「蒙古國」來。這可不是有田外相所謂華北理想區域的計劃的一部分麽。</p>
<p>我們從全民族的利害着想。是决不能容認這一種計畫。以及日本大陸政策的全部的。我們當今最急要的任務就是用全力來防止一切的華北分離運動。至於外交方面無論日本怎樣仗着武力的後盾。來妨礙我們對其他列强的友誼。我們當然也是非堅守着自己的立塲。拉住必要的友人不可的。</p>

<h3>英國對法愛莫能助</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於締結不于涉西班牙內亂協定之交涉、目前德意葡三國均提有保留條件、（按德國所提保留條件、係該國飛機被扣事件、應由西班牙政府予以滿意答復、意國保留條件、係禁止以金錢接濟西國兩交戰團體、並禁止人民志願投效、協助西國兩交戰團體作戰、葡國保留條件包括三項、卽（一）西國兩交戰團體、應尊重丹吉爾港中立地位、（二）蘇俄應與各國同時接受不干涉協定、（三）英法兩國應保障葡國領土完整）此間政界人士、頃以為各該國現方儘其所能、援助西國叛軍、無不懸望叛軍迅卽獲得最後勝利、以致對於締結不干涉協定之談判、多方留難、以期延宕時日、現在法國與論對於外國援助西國叛軍之所為、莫不憤慨異常、以致該國政府所處立塲大形困難、而時局形勢遂亦趨於嚴重、此在英國政府為法國所提出之交涉作聲援、旣已出其全力而未獲結果、自亦愛莫能助、而不復能左右德意雨國之態度矣、目前此間左派人士對於現行局勢、頗形焦慮、至於右派顯然袒護西國叛軍、並阻擬政府之行動、此政府所由僅以妥協為事？而無從採取其他措置也、（十三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>收到茶禮</p>

<p>己故顏料鉅商江陰人薛寳潤之子薛佳生、於本月一日下午五時二十五分、在法租界霞飛路一四一二弄五號被綁、事後家屬曾投報捕房請緝、各情已誌本報、迄已經旬、音信杏然、不意在昨日下午六時五分、薛忽得自匪窟中逃出、茲將詳情分誌如下</p>
<p>薛佳生之現况</p>
<p>薛佳生年三十四歲、為薛寳潤之第三子、故人稱薛老三、長兄桃生已故、决兄炎生、四弟淦生、佳生娶旅滬蘇州鉅商周渭石之女為妻、並有妾二、分居靜安寺路廟弄、及霞飛路一四一二弄五號、卽此次被綁處、佳生年來因爭產一再涉訟、家境已非昔比、前年寓馬斯南路時、曾一度被綁、故此次再度被綁、誠非意料所及、</p>
<p>二次被绑登車</p>
<p>佳生平日置有租界照會二〇五一號汽車一輛、並雇俄籍保鑣一名、每天在第二妾處晚膳、被綁之日、佳生於下午五時許、駕汽車至第二妾處、正登榻假睡、突來身穿短衫操本地及北方口音之匪徒五六名、託稱訪佳生之翠師丁貽堂、騙開前門、一擁而入、由三匪手執盒子砲登樓、將佳生架登預停弄內之假照會六九七四號黑牌汽車內、向善鐘路疾駛而去、事後家屬惶急萬狀、束手無策、乃投報該管捕房、請求嚴緝、</p>
<p>昨午跣足脫險</p>
<p>佳生自八月一日下午被綁後、先後計十三日、其家屬方面、始終未接匪方訊息、故焦念異常、詎昨日下午六時零五分鐘、公共租界成都路捕房第一千〇四十四號華捕、在成都路福煦路口站崗時、見有一人衣衫汚穢、跣足在路上行走、形色倉皇、自法租界貝禘塵路向一福煦路成都路口而逃、該捕見其形色可疑、遂喝令止步、向其盤問、據彼稱、卽為被綁之肉票薛佳生、方自匪窟脫險逃出、要求速為帶入捕房、以保安全、</p>
<p>華捕截車載送</p>
<p>華捕旣知係脫險肉票、事關重大、時適有租界照會第八七七七號陳公館之自備空汽車、駛經該處、華捕乃卽行截住、令薛佳生乘坐、載至成都路捕房、經略加安慰、俾使神智稍定後、始由探長馮百順探目王希昌向之詢問、據記憶所得、匪窟地點、的在法租界蒲石路、門牌巳不能記憶、平日匪黨防備嚴密、終日有四名武裝匪徒輪流看守、至昨下午始得乘機逃出脫險、當時成都路捕房、以本案發生地點、係在法租界、遂用電話通知法租界盧家灣捕房、囑卽移提歸案</p>
<p>探捕往搜匪窟</p>
<p>盧家灣捕房據報、遂派全班武裝中西探員四十餘人、分乘車五輛、至成都路捕房、將肉票薛佳生帶回法捕房、詳加訊問一過、並由薛將匪徒形貌略述一遍後、卽命薛帮同前往領捉、不謂匪窟係在蒲石路二百廿二號、當探捕等在蒲石路二百十號門首下車、擬作包圍形勢、兜捕時、已早被在沿街窗口把風之匪瞥見、悉被從露台上逸去、僅在屋中搜獲毛瑟槍兩枝、彈夾兩只、子彈三十粒、帶回捕房存案、薛佳生亦旋由捕房派探護送回寓、</p>

<h3>世運代表團隨征記　第七信中央社特派員馮有眞寄</h3>
<p>（三六）專車過奧赴德</p>
<p>二十二日淸長、選手們睡夢初醒、進用早餐後、就忽忽的走到火車站去、德國政府頂備了三輛專車、到威尼斯來迎接、已經停在站裏兩天了、專車都是二等、每輛八間、每間六座、適够分配、歐洲的二等車設備上、决不次於國內的頭等車、面對面的兩排絲絨長椅、隔成六個座位、把靠手扳上去的時候、又可當作臥舖、選手們按着隊別、分配座次、一時有說有笑、然閙異常、</p>
<p>七時一刻、專車離了威尼斯車站、疾馳而進、鐵路兩岸的半原、隔不多遠就有一個小小的村落、房屋整潔、雖我國的都市、亦不能及、每個村落裏、總有一二座教堂、尖頂高矗、氣象嚴滿、可見宗教之在歐洲、還是佔着極濃厚的勢力、所有可以耕種的土地、都種了各種農產品、一片綠野、絕無荒無之區、放在田裏的灌水機、用不到人去管理、不時的噴射着水珠、同雨點一樣的陣陣落下來、歐洲的農村、與我國相較、不能不令人起隔世之感、</p>
<p>車行不久、就進走阿爾卑士山派ALPS、鐵路兩岸的崇山峻嶺、直是高矗雲霄、削壁千仭、形勢極為險峻、遠望阿爾卑士的最高峯、積雪未消、雲霧密佈、山泉滙流而成的一條寬闊的溪澗、沿着山麓奔流、水勢異常湍急、與鐵路並行的一條柏油鋪成的公路、時有汽車往來、我們於欣賞雄偉綺麗的景色之餘、更驚嘆其物質建設之發達、但是山上的樹上、都很矮小、一望而知其為墨索里尼執政後才開始種植的、大的老的義大利帝國、也與我國是一樣的腐朽、可是法西斯的義大利、却一切都向淸前進的路上開展了、</p>
<p>火車向着阿爾卑士高原前進、穿過機十個大大小小的山洞、氣候幾如我國的深秋、頗帶寒意、下午一時許、抵不利那Brennero已是義國的邊境、照例出軍警檢查護照、車抵奧國邊境普斯不羅各城Innsonqk、又由奧軍檢查護照、手續均極簡單、</p>
<p>義奧兩國、祇有一山之隔、但是景象則逈不相同、奧國不產煤、而電氣事業則十分發達、所以機米用電力發動、旣無煤灰飛揚、速度又極迅捷、山上森林成蔭、作烏黑色，地下襯以碧綠色的牧草、景色秀麗、遠非義境所反、疎落的農村、佈置得整齊淸潔、簡直同花園一樣、據同車的陳梅君（前北大教授現在歐考察農林）說、德奧兩國對森林事業、極為注意、德國的森林佔全境四分之一、培植已數十年、現在一部分已經採伐、另植新苗、奧國一切事業、都追隨模仿德國、培植森林、亦巳二十餘年、尚未採伐、所以風景特為秀麗、德奧兩國對森林的保護、均訂有專法、每年規定一定的時期、狩獵採伐、違犯森林法者、處罰極為嚴厲、然而兩國人民自幼就受了良好的教育、對於森林均知愛護、從來沒有加以摧殘的、尤其是德國、他們在公路兩旁所種的、都是果木、不但花紅葉綠、使沿綫景色、益為秀美、且為國家增加一筆大宗牧人、可是每年果實成菊的時候、就是在路人走得口渴的人、也决不去採擴一顆、人民對公共　德　練到這樣程度、無怪經過大戰的創傷、能於短短的十餘年中、恢復了日耳曼民族的地位、</p>
<p>（三七）抵慕尼克</p>
<p>專車在花園似的奧國、走了六小時、已入德境、下午七時半抵國社黨發源地南德第一大城慕尼克Mnnchen、德國宣傳部代表、慕尼克市政府代表、及我國駐德大使館代表邱長康、國民黨駐德支部代表錢品松、慕尼克中國同學會會長張君、聲學生三十餘人、在站歡迎、下車整隊後、舉行一个簡單的歡迎會、先由在慕尼克留學的李立聰李淑家兩女士獻花、次由各代表致簡短的歡迎詞、選手團由沈嗣良答詞、並領導為兩國三呼萬歲、空氣極為煞烈緊張、禮畢、由慕尼克市政府代表招待我們到一處餐館晚宴、當我們在　道上排列着整齊的隊伍、魚貫前進的時候、人均駐足而觀、並揮手歡迎、使我們極感興奮、</p>
<p>九時許宴畢、德國宣傳部代表及市政府代表相繼致詞、慕尼克不但是國社黨革命的策源地、德國藝術的中心、且以產啤酒著聞於世、市政府代表致詞的結語說、這次因為時間忽促、未能盡量招待、希望將來回國時、能在慕尼克多留幾天、痛飲幾杯啤酒、語調詼諧幽默、全塲為之哄然大笑、沈嗣良答詞後、餐館裏的樂隊、在全體起立中為奏我國國歌、奏畢、復奏德國國歌、這個時候、所有在塲的德人、連站在外面看熱鬧的人、都平舉右手行禮致敬、態度極為嚴肅、可見愛國思想、已是很普遍的深印在每個人的腦筋裏了、最後由許民輝領導全體為兩國三呼萬歲、我們便在親密的空氣中、走出餐館、由市政府代表引導去瞻謁國社黨革命紀念館和公墓</p>
<p>希特勒組織國社黨、開始革命的時餱、是以慕尼克為根據地的、一九二三年一月九日、他的秘密機關被軍警發覺、前往被捕、經一度抗拒後、黨員十六人遇難、希特勒本人亦受傷、此後國社黨的聲勢、一天一天的發展、終於統握了全國的政權、國社黨就把這個秘密機關原址、改為革命紀念館、視為革命史中最重要的一頁、紀念館前面廣塲上、堅立了兩面十多丈高的黨國旗、台階上安置了十大個花圈、紀念迅十六個死難的黨員、我們於夜色蒼茫中、來膽謁這國社黨革命勝蹟、亦不禁肅然起敬、</p>
<p>死難黨員公墓、離紀念館不遠、在一個一千多公尺寬闊的廣塲中間、建造了兩座亭子、每座分兩排、安置八個鐵棺、廣塲四週、建了幾座偉大的紀念館、氣象極為莊嚴肅穆、我們沿着公墓憑吊一週、回到車站十一時三刻、又登車向柏林進發、</p>

<p>申報婦女專刊為女國民造新福之一種心理建設在「合理之勤工」  （荷蘭通信）螬食　　在前世紀之人，墨守舊社會之生活，無論東西南北，其除家務而外任職與勤工，幾乎全屬男子之事，而彼時有裨人帬幸福之一切設備，遠不能如今日之精進與高明，甚且年老者之衰廢與死亡，昔人亦視今人為早，今則婦女得與男子同起服勞，國無論其强弱，莫不可望潛增一大部分之工作能力，是以各界婦女之於選擇職事，隨處可以涉及衛生問題，當代婦人病專家DR，DORA　BRUCKE　TELEKY　泰來基女博士，近論「選擇職事對於女性健康之關係」略云：「凡過用力之事，其需較高深之學識，或待經年累月造就而方有成之一切事業，皆特利於女性。此外為女性計，所宜深切注意者，略如下述：一曰未及年者之上工，宜有嚴格之限制，女性之當身體發育未完滿時，如為多病貧血與夫神經易受刺激之人，尤不宜輕使工作。二則一般不甚健實之女子，不宜担任長日悶坐於不良空氣中之一切職司，又不宜為用力過大需時過多之女護士，宜使改擇按常規而不費大力，又能安心靜理之事，俾因作事有興趣而精神愉快，免至如長日無事者之有暇叔想自身，反而引起不可思議之憂慮與煩惱。三為旣婚婦人，如屬內顧家務而外兼一定之職司，則其一生之負荷，倍大於常人，此實經濟困難之家庭所萬不能免者，惟如操勞過甚之女性，却萬不可使足食足睡之兩要端，偶缺其一，若至休假出外，尤須有至滿足之調息與嬉遊。惟在嬉遊調息之中，不宜於柔軟操外，輕試專使大力之體操，不宜誤作更令人疲之運動競賽或練習。其四懷孕之婦人，不僅在用力者，亟宜减輕工作，卽如用心之事，亦屬切忌多勞。五曰年老退職期限之宜量予加寬，而如用心不用力之各種職業，年老者仍屬相宜，尤不必有任何之限制，若有人抱財政减縮主義，誤使年事不過高者，坐領養老之女性而仍繼續勤工者，每視無工，閑坐之輩為健快也。至若新時代有當預防之「職業病，」則男女所患，無不相同，可不必專為女性，另定任何辦法。惟女性體質，往往不如男性，對於女性之拂護，終當視對男性更為矜愼」云云。按我國成見，每贊有閑之福，而以多忙者為苦人，殊不知同此一忙，尚應加以科學之分析，其不得法之忙，固未嘗不可發生病苦，然終無人想及閑中所苦之絕對有害於衛生也。今日者，時艱正迫，世運翻新，男女國民，同負至大之責任，我二萬萬女同胞，若盡知盡快中有福，自屬無人不思任職與勤工，予因略興趣泰來基女博士有關婦工及婦人病經騐之談，以備留心海外婦運者之參考。日本職業婦人的酬報  一髪　　東京寳塚歌舞團把徵求女招待和掃除婦的廣吿發表之後，預料應徵者當在三千人左右，那知竟達萬人，殊可驚人，於此可見日本女子求職心切了。但是日本職業婦人的報酬，究何多少，很可為我國作比較的。　　裁縫師　裁縫師為女子的摩登職業之一，需要創作的才能。最重要是所設計的衣服樣式，要新奇而惹人喜歡。專門的衣服店及大公店的裁縫師，約自三十元至四十五元。主任技師可得六七十元。優秀的專門家亦可得百元左右。　　美容師　美容學校畢業的資格，從事於美容院勤働的。供給住宿飲食，每月十元，否則可得三十元。最近有了東三省最新出路，便可達七八十元。暢通服務時間較長，每月可得增加三五元，至五六十元為止。　　女秘書　實業家律師所雇用的女秘書，為數甚少。必須美貌年靑而有相當機智。住宿的約五十元，否則自七五十元至百五十元不等。　　圖書館職員　中等學校畢業而身體康健的可入上野圖書館員養成所訓練，最初四十元，成績優良，可增至百三十元，每年得賞金二次。　　女店員　百貨店採用女店員，遠在明治三十五年。到現在大公司中的男女職員，已成三七之比，男子大有淘汰之勢。女店員工作自晨八時起至晚六時止。每月逢八休息一日，日薪約七八角。高等女學出身的，一年後可增至一元。大約平均月薪為三十元左右。　　事務員　女子職業中最普通的，便是管理金錢出入的事務員。如鐵道郵政保險局等，自晨八時至晚五時，月薪二十四五元至三十五元。高等小學畢業的，每日半元至七角，不等。　　女記者　現東京雜誌報紙的女記者約有二百人。收入多少不等，最初大約可得五十元。編輯長太田菊子有七百元的收入，是不易多見的。普通均不滿二百元。　　電梯娘　是由近代建築而產生的新職業。每小時自地下室至七八層高的屋頂，往復三十餘回。收入可比女店員較大，小學畢業的每日八角，高等女學畢業的，約一元左右。　　電話娘　東京約有四千人，見習時期每日六角，高等女學畢業七角。職員自八角至一元，候補主事月薪四十六元，候補書記六十五元，通訊書記自八十元可至百二十元。　　摩特兒　以肉體美為資本的摩特兒，自六月至秋季美術展為止，需用最盛，每日約需三百人。時間分上午九時至正午，午後一時至四時，夜六時至九時三種。裸體的一元二角，着衣的八角，普通以一星期為期。故每月收入可得七八十元。　　舞女　舞塲開始時間自午後三時至五時半不等，至夜十一時止，伴舞一次，晝間六分，夜間八分。但一回僅三四分鐘，故晝夜勞働五小時，伴舞五十回，亦可得六元收入。普通每月可得六七十元至百元的報酬。歌謠中的婦女問題  巴玲　　『念歲姊，嫁個七歲郎日裏穿衣穿鞋送書房，夜裏脫衣脫襪抱上床；咽在頭邊沒音量，咽在脚後又恐老鼠抱過牆；長長竹竿晒衣裳，短短竹竿做文章，不怪爺來不怪娘，也不管那小郎君，只怪我自己命不祥，只得瞞了人家暗泣到天光！』　　上面這一首歌謠，是浙東關谿一帶所流行的。我把這首歌謠的內容，細細的研究一下，覺得這眞是一個値得注意的婦女問題。　　的確，誰都不能否認男女們的婚姻問題，是人生的一件大事，做父母的人，萬萬不能夠馬虎下去。尤其是早婚之害，是人所共知的。男女雙方的年齡，在不達到發育完全的時候，斷斷不能就馬上結婚，以免貽誤自己。同時，對於國家民族的前途，也有着很大的影響呢？　　然而，理論固然是如此；可是，在事實上的表現，却是怎樣呢？談到這一點，不由得不使我們感到十二分的痛心了！在目前農村之中，尤其窮鄉僻壤，風氣閉　的農村中，一般人對於子女的婚姻大事，大都以實行早婚為了却父母心頭的一件大事。所以，在農村之中，十五歲的男孩，和十三四歲的女孩結婚，是一樁並不希奇的事。可是，民族根苗的摧殘，未來小國民身體的孱弱，這種現象，是如何的令人可怕呀。而况，就男女本身方面說，為了早婚而斷送性命的，也是不可勝計。造成男獨女孤的慘劇，又是多魔的痛心，所以，早婚這一件事。我們在上面這一首歌謠裏，可以看出婦女們吃了早婚的虧，是如何的深刻和痛苦。這一個嚴重的婦女問題，眞是不容社會人士以及婦女界的先進們所忽視的。某小姐的備忘錄  綺鳳　　伊是一個健美的女性，伶俐而活潑像小鳥也姑娘。今年恰巧是二九年華了。伊姓甚，名誰？這裏可以不必寫，因為伊是我的同學，所以筆者就來賣一下「姑隱其姓名」的關子。現在，我稱伊為某小姐吧。　　當百花發散着惱人的芳香的時候，某小姐在宿舍裏徘徊着，伊那紅潤而丯艷的臉龐，一對烏黑的大眸子，一張會說會笑的櫻桃嘴，從這三種上瞧：我們可以窺見到某小姐有些煩悶了。伊那對烏黑的大眸子時時閃動着想方法；一張會說會笑的紅嘴唇，這時候儘用牙齒咬着下唇在發楞；整個的臉龐上籠罩着一種難以解决的神氣。　　「我不該那樣傻，……我要聰慧些呀！」伊的櫻唇上這魔喃喃自語着，接着是滿臉露着嬌笑，不能解决的事，總算從這兩句話　解决了。　　於是，伊坐在寫字臺房旁，從抽屜內拿出了一册精美的備忘錄來，提起筆來沙沙的寫。　　伊在記些什麽呢？現在讓我把它供諸同好吧：　　人名——年齡——容貌——體力——財力　　陳××——三八——六〇——一〇〇——一五〇　　王××——一六——一〇〇——六〇——三〇　　魏××——三五——七〇——九〇——九〇　　沈××——五〇——二〇——七〇——一〇〇　　林××——二二——九〇——四〇——五〇　　（一〇〇分為滿分，六〇分為及格）　　這就是某小姐備忘錄上所錄下來的一張表，據某小姐說，伊有好幾個用意，現在讓我再寫在下面：　　　當伊要愛玩男子的時候，就寫一封快信給王　　，結果伊從這美少年身上享受的快樂是無限的。　　　當伊要錢的時候：寫信給沈　　，這個老頭兒的錢袋總是飽飽的。自然會很願意送給伊。　　　當伊要散步的時候，就寫信給林　　，必能勝任愉快的。　　　需要體力的時候：就寫給運動員陳　　……　　　……？（這點伊沒有吿訴我，不能妄斷。）　　看了伊上面的方法，確是一個聰明伶俐的小姐。　　我和伊離開快一年了，聽朋友說：結果伊脫不了金錢的引誘而和沈　　結婚去了。　　現在，伊在度着姨太太的生活。本報特寫女小說家　劉小蕙女士會見記  寄萍　　臨行吐口寃氣　赴日內瓦攻小說及語言學　生平愛好小說曾譯著多種　談起了北平發生無限感慨　但願國人苦幹　　無論那個人，能有八種福：　有廣大的墳墓，安葬祖先，　有賢慧的良妻；　長壽；　多子孫；　五榖豐收；　有學問；　有錢財；　有許多愛他的人。但有些人在這幾種福中，一種也沒有，那種人就呌「八去福」。這是劉小蕙女士的處女譯作「朝鮮民間故事」第一篇開首的幾句話，眞說得頗有道理。小蕙女士的芳名，南方人也許不很熟，但華北她已有相當的聲譽，尤其平津方面喜歡看小說的人，莫不知道她是一位聰明好學的女作家，那樣年靑而肯不斷的努力，前途的確有希望。　　兩年前在北平病逝的語言學者劉復（半　）敎授，便是她的父親，她從小受良好的家庭敎育，所以七八歲進修，法文程度已很高，十五歲便開始翻譯小說。因為父親早死了，她想繼續遺志，力求深造，七月卅日到了上海，準備放洋手續，八月八日乘法郵Aramis　號赴日內瓦進Fribourg大學研究小說及語言學，預定兩年後轉入巴黎大學，至少四年，繼能回國。　　年靑的姑娘，怕匈生容，北方的習氣，總不比上海來得開通。我這次和早女士會面，幸得蔡孑民夫人的介紹，　能一見如故，而且談了很久的話。她衣服穿得很樸素，看起來似乎嚴格壯健，但她自己說，心臟衰弱，不能多勞動，惟其如此，在學業的進程上，受了不少的打擊！　　她說：「我從小生長上海，三歲隨父游法，九歲才回國，居於北平，入孔德中學，畢業後升中法大學，因體弱中途輟學，在家自修，得父親的訓導，三年之中，得益不淺，比在校實惠得多呢。別種學科，我都不喜歡。惟一愛好的，便是小說。國文雖在國外時從母親學了一點，可要算回國之後才正式學起的。白話文究竟比文言文容易得多，學了不過三四年，就能翻譯了些簡短的東西，十五歲那年，譯成了一朝鮮民間故事」、譯了還要出版，現在想想。眞是好矣。我父親於述作和翻譯，一向不主張過度的愼重，他說：「隨便亂寫，把我頭塌油了，弄得不可收拾，固然不是道理，若過於矜重，一下筆就想到了藏之名山，傳之後世，從而毛髮悚然，把筆畢收拾了再談，其結果恐怕終身寫不成一個字，憑你有多大的天才與學問，其可以藏之名山傳之後世者，　是本人的一副白骨而已。」我所以本此宗旨，不自量力，先後出版了幾部小說；　朝鮮民間故事，　蘇來曼東游記；　法國中古短笑劇；現正着手譯的，有　神曲，是意大利作家旦丁所著，　方西納，是法國作家所著的，大約二年之內，可以完成。此番是歐之後，想把身體調養好。再多著幾部小說，以償夙願。　　「女士平日最喜歡那一派小說？」我帶關測騐的口氣問她。「我還是喜歡法國雨果，莫泊桑，左拉幾個人的小說。因為他們的抒情描寫，和我比較迫近，他們著的原本或是譯本，都看得不少。國人所著的小說，除了謝冰心，巴金，綠漪幾人外，很少瀏覽。此去想一面求學，一面寫作，希望跟幾位小說名家，多學點做小說的技巧，本來還想學點中國古體詩，不過一到海外，機會便少，只好改學法國詩了。」　　「女士久居故都，所得的印象如何？」談到北平，大家難免感慨萬千，我便請她發表些意見。果然她聽了我的問話，頓時愁容滿面，悽切的說：「北平實在太可愛了！我一下子住了八九年，簡直不忍離開這可愛的北平，然而現在不容你留戀了　！那種黑暗的陰霾恐怖的局面。在在使人傷心，悲憤！中國人的北平，而入於强暴的勢力圈內，凡在血氣的人，無不怒髮衝冠！如今不但我中國人成覺苦病，便是歐美人士，無形中受了壓迫！他們一樣愛好北平，想要久居的，也不容你自由，只得也南遷了。自稱東方文明國的軍人，不知多麽野蠻，講不到禮貌，什麽事都幹得出，尤其婦女們，一到晚上，幾乎不能出門，想不到文明國的人，是這樣自由行動的！先前報上還見到種種不法的新聞，現在都不許登載了！北平

<p>時代醫藥刊自療常識手淫斵喪後之補救  性病專科詹念曾醫師　　手淫之害，有二喩可　，即比之為放血與絕食也，夫精成之於血，凡稍明生理者類能知之，精之貴重，實千百倍於血，申言之，手淫一次，等于放血半磅也，人見放血則駭悸失色，獨對于手淫嗜酖如飴，寗不大謬，至于精之為用，不僅子嗣所繫國，卽腦髓血液，肌肉臟骸之營養，亦全賴乎精之昇華，故犯手淫者，往往面黃肌瘦，虧損百端，蓋全身失去其昇華之營養，與絕食又有何異，故此二喩，非僅貼切，抑亦警惕也。　　手淫之補救，首在補精，補精特效，以「生殖素」為最，蓋「生殖素」功能大補精血腦髓，實為手淫斵喪後惟一救星，如已罹有遺精者，則切記須同時並服遺精名藥「希米脫氏固精片」為要。青年得救  任國祥醫師　　患者陸君：浙江雙林人，年二十四歲，生而穎悟，貌亦秀美，在求學時代，為劣友所誘，亦犯手淫，暗室戕伐，異常劇烈，循至精薄腦弱，肌瘦血枯，失眠健忘，學業銳退，顏蒼肌皺，失去美姿，已面突現遺精，病勢愈趨愈烈，甚至白日恍惚亦遺，衰頹可知，非不醫也，無如藥不對症，功效渺茫，今春來診，余選用精遺名藥「希米脫氏固精片」治其遺精，而以「生殖素」救其衰弱，補其虧損，陸君前後向太和華美藥房購服和四五盒，不惟遺精早痊，且血旺精足，肌壯腦健，充分表現其原有之智力與美姿云。戒煙心得戒煙有八法推「培補戒法」  香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超　　為最安全可靠　　欲求戒煙斷癮，務先去體內之煙毒，否則煙毒不去，煙癮無從驅除也，惟癮與毒，因果相乘，癮愈重則毒愈深，毒愈深則癮愈重，相煎相迫，非至舉一身一家之精華，盡斷送于雲霧中不止也，是故戒煙方法，當注重癮毒並除焉明矣，惟是戒煙有安眠，發泡，抗毒，代替，血淸，變質，抽血及培補等八法，其中大半有手術之苦，住院之煩，或者疾患湧現，或則萎靡不安，惟培補戒法，最為安全，自由內服，不勞手術，秘密自戒，無庸住院，治病挽弱，疾患不作，培補精神，安全愉快，故為著名醫師所賞用，而培補成劑之選擇，又莫不推「生殖素」為箇中翹楚，唯一權威，如前月余曾用以戒除倪徐二君之遠年煙癮，戒期均極縮短，戒時又極安全，洵禁毒戒煙聲中之福音也。骨痛痛感之來由及其治法  王士英醫師　　骨痛一症，病狀不一，若肌痠產，筋痙，肢麻，體癱，皆其變症也，考其所以致痛致痠之由，蓋患者體中血份不潔，尿酸過多，形成結晶，裝如玻屑，作崇流竄，百感雜起，如不加相當之治療，則血管漸漸硬化，而肢麻體癱繼起，終至溢血猝倒中風暴斃，　　骨痛之來由旣明，則其活法亦自瞭然，尿酸之當解，血毒之當淸，初不僅袪風云濕而已也，名藥「强斯登氏骨痛片」，配製精到，兼具上述種種功效，故對于骨痛及由骨痛而轉變之各症，克收藥到病除之效，而藥性之適合華人體質，尤為普通製劑所不及云。　　患者查君：年四十二歲，晟舍人，業商，罹骨痛多年，因病源複雜，故迭服各藥，均難奏功，自介紹向太和藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」後，骨節舒適，筋絡鬆暢，痛苦盡云，因同時並服「生殖素」，故迅復壯健，出于意料云。急淋成慢濁重發得根治  劉志民醫師　　患者成君：住武昌路，染濁年許，先急後慢，誤服劣藥，收毒入內，一再復發，困苦難言，自向中西藥房購服「安敵淋」後，淋止濁凈，尿利溺淸，連服四盒有半，克吿根治，從不再發云。性病講座  詹念曾醫師姚爾昌博士合編　　（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。遺精失眠衰病叢身　　患者嚴君：春末來訴有遺精夢洩，精薄腦弱，失眠健忘，耳鳴目眩，腰　背疼等症，余診得其神經衰弱已瀕極度，詰悉係緣在少年時代，犯劇烈之手淫所致，基結構陷於鬆弛，生殖腺亦衰頹不堪，往日雖服補劑多種，均以藥不對症，難奏特效，余除施行電療外，當囑向永安公司購服遺精名藥「希米脫氏固精片」以固其精關，治其遺洩，而以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」補其精髓，起其衰弱，連服五盒，所患霍然盡去，重登袵席，如慶更生云。賢痿早洩生趣索然　　患者　君：蘇州人，年三十六歲，商界，前月由曾在余處以「安敵淋」根治其遠年白濁之馮君介紹來診，據訴前亦罹花柳惡症，治未斷根，以致摧殘性能，形成萎頹，罹有早洩綦烈，夫婦有名無實，子嗣難期，生趣索然，余當為之施行最新電波療法，而以「六〇六」要治其梅毒，用「安敵淋」要治其白濁，並囑向太和藥房購服「生殖素」以挽回其生機，恢復其性能，期祗月許，即沉疴霍然，現在虎虎有力，宛若兩人云。白帶乳萎健康喪失　　患者陳吳氏：年在三十左右，寗波人，三月中旬來診，據訴經來輒不調準，時則提早，時則落後，且或多或少，亦不一定，行經前先感腰　，行經中常現腹痛，余訴得陳夫人宮炎作痛，罹有白帶，生殖腺素缺乏，故行經不準，乳峰不發達，骼格雖美，但肌肉瘦削，無從顯現其健美矣，當介紹向五洲藥房購內服「女用生殖素」，外用「療帶靈」，內外兼施，肌肉壯茁，胸部發育，經調帶凈，重　其新婚時代之健美云。淋濁炎症危害生命　　患者任君，前年為劣友所誘，作樂妓寮，染來淋病，因名譽及職位有關，故隱忍不宣，暗中力求醫藥，不意惡運臨頭，復為庸醫劣藥所誤，將毒入骨內，看似輕釋，實極險惡，先現睪丸炎，繼發膀胱炎，腫脹刺痛，精血淋漓，困苦難堪，生不如死，病狀暴露，隱秘無從，幸由至友蔡君介紹來診，即施行電療，投服淋病聖藥「安敵淋」，炎症統消，淋濁根治，並服「生殖素」起其生機，期祗四旬，頓返壯健云。通俗醫藥淋濁性關節炎疼之澈底根治法  兪伯符醫師　　淋病失治，變症最多，如睪丸炎，膀胱炎，精系炎，關節炎其最著者，而其中以關節炎為最習見，患者每視同風濕骨痛，而以普通骨痛藥治之，輒難奏效，蓋係由本症淋菌入骨，血毒不潔而起，治法自以殺菌淸血為要，對症發藥，殺菌滅淋，當服「安敵淋」，淸毒治痛，當服「强斯登氏骨痛片」，則雙方並顧，可以澈底根治，例如：　　春末有患者方君：年卅一歲，所罹骨痛，百藥罔效，經余診得其病源在于淋病潛伏，毒菌入骨所致，即囑向太和藥房購服敵淋名藥「安敵淋」殺菌滅淋，而以「强斯登氏骨痛片」淸毒治痛，連服四五盒，沉疴霍然而起，脫離苦海，如重登彼岸云。衰弱　腦神經衰弱性神經衰弱  賈治中醫師　　……病源……　　神經系統，密佈全體，支配動作，發生感覺，如神經繁榮者，則身壯體健，精强力足，如神經衰弱者，則身虧體憊，精疲力乏，治療之先，當先明其所以致衰弱之由，蓋神經之繁榮，全持生殖腺素之營養，如生殖腺衰頹或生殖腺素缺乏者，則神經失去繁榮，陷入衰弱，腦病性病紛起雜呈，對症用藥，自以投服『生殖素』為最宜，如患者鮑君所罹頭暈，健忘，失眠，多夢等症，咸為腦神經衰弱症，患者丁君之性弱，賢萎，精薄，衰頹等症，咸為性神經衰弱症，自向安公司購服『生殖素』後，均期未一月，各吿痊愈，回復壯健而去云，名藥實驗　　市上同類藥品甚多，購時務要堅决指明索購，勿被慫恿誤購他藥為要　　（遠年白濁）　　患者錢君：年卅三歲，浦東人，業商，所患白濁，遍服各藥，均難奏效，遷延失治，化為慢性，後由德醫介紹服「安敵淋」，當向華美藥房指明購服，病勢逐漸輕痙，四盒甫完，淋菌已吿絕跡，因求迅速恢復其生機起見，同時並服「生殖素」奏效如神云。　　（手淫遺精）　　患者史君：年十九歲，海門人，學界，五年前誤犯手淫，迄難戒絕，以致身體虧損，釀成遺精，初常每月數次，嗣竟每旬多次，憊頹難堪，自向五洲藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」以治遺精，並服「生殖素」以補虧損後，遺精根治，重未再發，身體壯茁，重獲發育，精神煥發，如同再造云。　　（胃痛救治）　　　　患者李君：胃痛頻作，痛緊時欲昏欲睡厥，迭服各藥，祗能麻醉一時，未能根治，以致胃病身弱，康健無望，自向中西藥房購服「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」後，胃痛根治，胃臟壯健，食慾旺盛，體重大增云。　　（白帶小產）　　患者陶氏：年三十左右，罹白帶有年，身體虧弱，迭次小產，去年又孕，由美醫介紹內服「女用生殖素」安胎保產，外用「療帶靈」，凈　治帶後，今春欣舉一雄，母兒均健，闔家欣然云，夫婦智識  美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌判明「久婚乏嗣」之責任誰屬？！　　男子患性病，女子罹隱病——均為不孕之原因　應洞察病理，須採求療法——則求孕方合學理　因來函詢問者越多，故在此作一總答復　　「有健全之身體，而後有健全之子女」，然久婚乏嗣者，不敢有此非分之妄想，求一柔弱之子女，且不可得，有比登天之難，於是或者求醫服藥，或者求神拜佛，遲延歲月，功效幾何，馬齒徒增，自嘆莫及矣，納妾藏嬌，家庭幸福破產，立嗣承繼，暗中血統潛移，要知求嗣之道，原非難事，病理療法，有不可不研究者。　　屬於男子方面的　　乏嗣原因，屬於男性的最多，如梅毒，白濁，遺精，早洩，賢痿，罹者甚眾，而治之失當及治未斷根者亦不尠，除梅毒白濁病源在病菌作崇外，其餘均係生殖腺衷頹所致，治法梅毒可用「六〇六」，白濁可服「安敵淋」，遺精須服「希米脫氏固精片」，而早洩賢痿及遺精患者培補衰弱均須服「生殖素」則所患根治，性能恢復，生機重萌，夫婦之感情如同新婚，一索得男，有何難哉。　　屬於女子方面的　　不育原因，屬于女性的亦不少，如月經不調，白帶纏綿，其不妊症之最習見者，但婦女處境異于男子，拘束殊多，身抱隱病，不願吿述，藥不對症，康健難期，自療常識，擇藥智識，應宜灌輸，「女用生殖素」為婦科百病要藥，功能調經健宮，安胎保產，治病强身，回春美顏，至於發育乳峰，猶其餘事，外用「療帶靈」以凈應去炎，根治白帶，則土腴田肥，禾生雙穗，直意中事耳。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言吃湯糰  我　　本地人早上如不吃飯泡粥，則大餅油條之外，每喜歡吃湯糰，而學校之中，喜吃湯糰之風更甚，平日對於學課，毫不注意，專事閒游浪蕩看影戲，習跳舞的學生，沒有不喜歡吃湯糰的，尤其是學校所持為事柱子的幾位體育家，除體育之外，其他功課，差不多多有吃湯糰的資格，現在世界蓮動，我國體育家，亦前往參加，人數不下百人，費時的有兩月，一切公私費用，總計亦不下百萬元，結果買了一個外國大湯糰回來，眞是不幸得很。　　據說我國參加世運，本來希望甚少，如跳高，跳遠，挪標槍，擲鐵球，以及遊泳等等藝術，各國程度怎樣，我國程度怎樣，不必比賽，早可預次，此次參加，不過欲我國幾位體育家，廣廣眼界，並且在世界體育界，亦佔一席地，故此次參加世運，醉翁之意，原不在酒，故其希望，不在於現在，而乃在於將來，這也不說他們的不對。　　不過此次參加世運，希望原不甚奢，但是總有一些希望方敢前去，如符保盧之跳高，籃球足球的藝術，均有僥倖之可能，但是一到外國。事事落後，非但曾經慘敗於我國的各國，今日反為所敗。卽在國內比賽的成績，亦竟不能保持，此眞失望之外令人失望者也。　　當我國甄拔世運選手時，卽大鬧其選舉不公，選舉舞弊，已經令人浩歎，因為甄援選手，不僅為個人爭入格，亦為國家爭體面，取短舍長，威情用事，早為輿論界所齒冷，而世運成續，又若是慘敗，此種過失。誰實負之，其次由於我國之人，勇於私門，法於公敵，此次參加世運諸將，平日在國內，耀武揚威，頗有不可一世之概，今見各國健兒，摩拳擦掌，英氣勃勃，以致望風而靡，連平日成績，多不可靠，更其次，由於我國人「捧塲」太足，如許承基之網球，美人魚之游泳，若比較各國，本有小巫見大巫之別，而舉國若狂，風靡於一世，諸體育家，亦志高意滿自命不凡，以上種種，卽此次吃湯糰之一大原因　　史稱漢光武見小敵怯，見大敵勇，其實打仗，本應如此，不足為奇，而史家獨稱之者，因為我國之人勇於小敵，怯於大敵，已成習慣，而漢光武獨能見小敵怯，見大敵勇，所以史家大古而特書之，欲為後世法也。</p>

<p>南行散記  艾荼　　熱　　離開上海的時候長先生帶着她來送我的船，坐在船蓬下，迎面飄過來一陣一陣淸凉的海風，六月的黃浦江還是寒的呵！可是，維姊却很聰明，很有經騐的吿訴我們！「船過了厦門，到了汕頭就熱得要命哩！」船在噪雜的海岸綫上載飛出了吳淞，黃昏又帶來了黑色的夜，一片一片的銀濤在海空飄蕩，胸懷上蓋着大棉被，在昏迷的盪動裏睡去了。　　船像一隻懶惰的蜈蚣，慢慢地在碧色的海面爬向南方去，又像一個發瘋的獅子，咆哮地迸出了白色的泡沫來，泡沫跟着兩邊的水波展開，在無涯的海面迅速地消散了。　　「熱哪！」人們都像投進了火爐裏似的嚕囌起來，當船經過厦門的海面的時候，那高高在坐在蔚藍色的天空上的太陽就熱愛地張開牠的眼睛了，船蓬底下就變了火爐，我的頭腦在熱裏打着圈子，又像一個囚徒似的難過起來。　　「我們已飄到靠熱帶的海了。」　　可是，跟着熱的想像來了的：　　「我的家鄕又來了哪！那可愛的妹妹又將迷着眼珠子的迎接我了」。　　汕頭中山公園　　傳說厦門公園是南中國第一個美麗的地方，可惜，我在海上流浪了兩三年，還沒有機會去玩過，如今，我却到了跟厦門公園有同樣的名勝的汕頭公園來了。眞是一個不錯的地方呢！當我悄悄地跨過了那白色的士敏土的橋，那一座蔭林和叢翠的小山，隱隱現現地在我的眼睛裏幻變着了。從遠遠的海面飄過來南方的風，淸凉得很，只要很那白熱的馬路上跑進這兒來，就像溜進了天堂一樣的。在那環繞着廣大的園林的小河邊慢步着，可以看見汕頭的第一個特色，不錯，汕頭的婦女有點兒聰明，她們都會利用天然，像孩子似地蹲在河岸的石級上，她們都擠得緊緊的，赤着健美的腿兒在水面洗衣裳，年靑的還不時地唱着歌，太陽熱烈地撫慰着她們的臉，背，淡黃的河水反映着她們的影子，這樣地展開着一個大眾的園地，這是北方所看不到的。　　公園裏的假山，穿雲洞有點兒好像神仙故事裏的煉丹臺，高高在矗立在叢綠的葉子上只要一進去，就可以避開了那熱的氣燄了。　　「南國是溫柔可愛的呵！」我坐在那兒眞有點兒留戀呢。　　無票的搭客　　在船上，熱和悶的空氣把我把的腦海搗得昏了，我正在無力地望着白茫的海的時候，就聽到穿白制服的收票員，像狼似地咆哮着，吆喝着：　　「這麽大膽，不買票了。」　　等我回轉過頭去看的時候，那兩個沒有證明書的退伍兵士，跟三個飢黃的落泊的靑年，受了侮辱的地閉着嘴巴，瞪着這十把個威武的海員，不作一嚮的。　　「給我滾蛋，不要給飯他們吃呵！」　　吵着，罵着，三個靑年落泊者望也不一望的垂下頭了。　　拍的一聲，一個耳光打在一個盛氣的年靑人的臉上，馬上現出了紫紅色的痕來：　　「把他們都帶到賬房去，連同行李都拿去！」　　這樣就像犯人一樣的送走了，我透斷了兩節手指  沈家千　　幹好公事回辦公室，我幾乎像從游泳池起來一樣，全身淋着水珠了。窓外的大雨還是猛烈地下着，本來已過了寫字間時間，但是回家比不得幹公事那樣重要，我索性脫去了可以絞出來水來的外衣，躺在寫字椅里休息，一直等到八點鐘才穿上那襲還滴着水漬的雨衣回家。　　當天晚上就生起病來，一病就是三天，打電話到公司請假的時候，我聽見耳機旁的主任先生對接電話的茶房說：　　—什麽？人又不是報紙糊的，淋一點雨就要生病！　　我掛上了耳機，兩條腿發抖料着，幾乎跌下地去。　　躺到床上，百感交集，一個終年牛馬一樣在風霜雨雪之中為生活奔走的可憐虫誰能保證他不生病呢？主任先生坐在汽車的角落里，抽着上等的烟捲，卽是車窓外面下着雨，雪，但在他的目光中或許是一幅很美麗的雨景，而坐汽車賞雪更是另有一番風味的。　　我幾乎壓制不住我的憤怒，想趕到辦公室去辭職。　　下午一個朋友來看我，我們是同學，但已許久不見面了。　　他一進門，就坐到我的床前來，像一個母親那樣慈愛的向我：「生了病嗎」？　　「怎知道的？我們已經許久不見面了。」我回答。　　他沒有立刻回答我，他向窓外望着，窓外還是下着雨，將近一個星期了，還是沒有放晴的樣子。　　「為了廠里要配另件」，他還是注視着窓外，說話的聲音更柔和了，恐怕驚動什麽似的，「訂電話到你們公司里，帶便問起你，知道你病了，三天沒有到寫字間！」　　「是的」。我接着說：「下大雨的那天我到楊樹浦去收賬，電車下來呌不着車子，帶走帶跑在雨里淋了二十分鐘，回家就病倒了」。　　他點點頭，彷彿他已經完全知道了。「安心地養幾天吧。我有事，過天再來望你」。他才回過頭來，伸頭手掌撫摩我的額角。　　「什麽？」當他的手掌伸過來的時候，我看淸楚他的食指和中指斷了，用紗布包着，外面有黃的藥和紅的血漬，我不由地心驚呌起來。　　他笑了笑，那樣隨便，責備我似的說：　　「有什麽大驚小怪呢？在工廠裏做事斷了兩節手指直是太平常了；一個强壯的人在九秒鐘裏結束了他的生命的也不過得到五十塊錢撫　費…」　　我還呆視着他，彷彿他和我的距離太遠了，我幾乎不能看淸楚他是在笑還是哭。他馬上又向窗外看去，還是那樣輕聲低柔的說：　　「機器的軸頭裏走了油，我剛用棉紗去揩拭的時候，管理機器的工人沒有看見我，他按照時間開動了，我來不到退讓，截去了兩節手指…　　（他輕輕地撫摸着用紗布包着的手指）　　「眞是運氣，如果再慢幾秒鐘，我們沒有見面的時候了。」　　彷彿講着一件新聞似的，他說完後站起身來和我握手道別了。　　我望着他走出我的房間，又扶身起來走到窗前，看他冒着雨向弄堂外走去的時候，我想起卓別麟的摩登時代來了，一個工人不是在午飯時候被捲進機器裏嗎，他祇能仰着頭接受卓別麟授給他的麺包和鷄腿。但是那是戲劇，一個人被機器捲進去之後，决不是僅僅犧牲了一頓午餐，那末，截去兩節手指眞是好運氣了。這樣想着時，我該向我的朋友道賀，但是他已經走遠了，或許他已到了工廠，在截去了他兩節手指的機器旁工作着。　　我慢慢地在室內喥着圈子，似乎我的病已經完全好了，我再也不想一點什麽事情：祇是偶或抬起頭來向窗外望去，希望雨已經停止了，明天就是一個大晴天。播音特別節目　　月光藝社　　元昌（一一二〇）上午九時半至十時一刻　　恭賀新禧（扈象餘）（馬廷龍）（黃麟）摩登戀愛（秋虹）從軍別愛（秋霞）努力（秋雯）春情飄蕩（蓓琳）人生的疲倦（馬德梅）蝴蝶姑娘（秋虹）（秋葉）春之花（秋雯）春雨初晴（蓓琳）小妹妹（馬德梅）睡的贊美（秋螼）飄泊者（扈胤）甜蜜的夢（黃麟）小桃紅（葉滌豐）聲調之光（秋霞）　　元昌（一一二〇）上午十一時　　國樂組　霓裳曲　皆大允喜　薰風曲　世外桃源　　雛聲歌唱社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時半至五時一刻　　窮富姻緣（蘋影）休息五分鐘（蘋影）休息五分鐘（莉影）偉大的愛（蕊英）（許動）悲秋（秋霞）國花（符斌）民族之光（潺潺）挑夫曲（瑋莤）救國進行曲（馬太）瑪琍若是你願意（秋冰）永別了我的弟弟（范英）關外高歌（蕊英）回來吧！（蘋影）（莉影）　　中華口琴會　　福音（八四〇）下午五時至五時半　　天堂與地獄（王慶隆）（吳鎭宇）我們的太陽（王慶隆）（曾凱超）進行曲（故鄕的憧憬）（短音階，長音階并用）月夜情歌（王慶隆）（吳鎭宇）　　當電劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　領導：陳突　　吳翻譯官　邱詠海　葛潤生　賀斌　聽差甲　陳逸　聽差乙　徐士鑫　鳴時（幼時）　徐倩　李新元　顧顔　余大人　馬翎　吳繼祖　林蜚　李某　周守　林士訓　黄河　華淑貞　程樸　楊毓芬　徐顰　吳鳴時　何劍飛漢奸的子孫　　全國的走私　中，私貨的暢銷，我國的工商業是遭到到了巨大的打擊，簡直給工商業一個致命傷，使牠踏上了破產的死亡路綫。　　漢奸們只要有利可圖，他們是失去了天性的瘋狂着運送私貨到內地去，為了他自己可以賺錢，再也沒有　　　　　　　。　　自己祖傳下來都是為洋人服務謀利益的，可是自己的親生的兒子却会参加缉私救國會來反對那種準亡國奴的漢奸行動，在父親覺得兒子這種行動是大大的不舒服，在兒子覺得幾代傳下來尤其是父親那種失去了天性的漢奸行動，自己是需要給一種有力的淸算。　　漢奸們的毒計，反而完成了學生的實踐。　　自强歌詠社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時一刻　　（一）打磚　（二）民族魂（三）疾風捲悲愁（四）母親（五）救亡進行曲（六）美哉中華（七）滿江紅（八）旗正飄飄（九）打長江（十）誰説我們年紀小　　英雄社　　交通（一三○○）下午五時三刻至六時半　　恭賀新禧（曼英）浪淘沙（曼雄）從軍別愛（曼琰）勇士凱歌（經濟）城市之光（曼豪）銀漢雙星（曼麗）打長江（何勳）天倫歌（曼英）人員桃花（曼豪）舟中曲（曼　）　　電霞社平劇　　交通（一三〇〇）下午十時一刻　　棒打（蔣拱宸）法門寺（汪緋祖）丁山打雁（朱煥文）（王錦堂）劈山救母（宋守義）（顧德隆）天霸間樵（王坪石）坐宮盜令（陸兆元）（焦小姐）歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　華東（一三六〇）下午四時至五時　　　甜蜜的夢　紅顏軍士　夜半的私語　Ha　Cha　Clia　洋化靑年　凱旋歌　牢吟曲　追回春來　　（十六日）　夜花園裏　I　Nerer　had　A．C　hance　紅淚悲歌　從軍別愛　扁冊情侶　國色天香　迷途的羔羊　水東流　　華興（一二六〇）下午六時半至七時一刻　　　心上裂痕　　返故鄕　寳貴的幼年　狂歡曲　茉莉思鄕　鮮花新婚　鶯鳳和鳴　醉花興酒　　（十六日）　春江花月夜　arrv　Wldow　心兒跳　我的妹妹　桃源春夢　夢中遠別　西湖春曉　紅玫瑰　　華興（一二六〇）下午七時一刻至八時　　　One　Night　of　love　　商何處尋　竹林相會　璇宮艷史　我　　忘了你　月圓花好　羣星亂飛　春農　舞曲　　（十六日）　春情飄蕩　離別了姑娘　心底變遷　相愛相親　芭蕉的心　春之花　Cocdails　fc　　　桃李爭艷</p>

<h3>The Situation in Guangxi Remains Unclear; Hope for Peaceful Mediation Not Extinguished; Huang Xuchu and Li Pinxian Flying to Guangzhou Today; Zhang Renmin Meets Huang Shaoxiong in Mancang; Three Guangxi Warplanes Fly to Guangzhou to Join the Central Government; Foreign News Reports Li Bai Determined to Resist and Form an Independent Military Government</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After being persuaded by various parties via telegram, Li Bai has the intention to step down, but the selection of a successor is still under discussion. Huang Xuchu and Li Pinxian are scheduled to take special plane No. 1001 sent by Chiang to Guangzhou on the 15th to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and discuss matters in detail with Huang Shaoxiong. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Regarding the Guangxi situation, the Central Government still adheres to its original intention of peace and is working hard to persuade Li Bai to go north and assume his new post. Since President Chiang's arrival in Guangdong, this atmosphere has become even stronger. However, both Chinese and foreign individuals here are doubtful about the outcome of the peaceful efforts. Yesterday, Cheng and Ju jointly went to Guangxi to make a final attempt at peaceful mediation. (Hualian News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zheng Zixiang, the third squadron leader of the Guangxi Air Force, along with his deputy, Li Yifei, squad leader Liang Weiru, and airman Luo Shimin, flew three warplanes from Guangxi to Guangzhou at 5:00 PM on the 14th to pledge their allegiance. They arrived at Tianhe Airport at 7:00 PM and landed. Zheng and others immediately went to pay respects to Yu Hanmou and Chen Cheng, saying that their defection was to oppose the civil war.

In addition to Li Bai, the members of the new government also include Cai Tingkai and Jiang Guangnai. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chairman Chiang and various important generals have been holding significant meetings every day to discuss the Guangxi situation. According to opinions from several sources, even if negotiations with the Guangxi warlords fail, the Central Government will not immediately resort to force. President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, may be dispatched to Guangxi to make a final effort for a peaceful resolution. At the same time, according to Chinese sources in Wuzhou, Guangxi troops are advancing south, and clashes have occurred near the Bei River. All Chinese newspapers here claim that Li and Bai have resolved to resist and have established an independent military government on August 15th. Currently, there are still 16 foreigners staying in Wuzhou, eight of whom are British. All foreign women and children residing in the area have now been evacuated to Hong Kong. The British gunboat "Aircraft," the American gunboat "Panay," and the French gunboat "D'Iberville" are all currently stationed in Wuzhou. All foreigners in the inland areas of Guangxi have now been evacuated to coastal areas. Since Chairman Chiang arrived here, the New Life Movement has been vigorously promoted in Guangzhou, with regulations to improve sanitation, revise traffic management, prohibit cruelty to animals, strictly prohibit bizarre clothing, ban gambling, and initiate a quiet movement, even limiting church bells to no more than 15 rings each time. In addition, it is forbidden to eat, spit, or throw dirty objects into the ditches on the streets. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

Huang expressed that he had no attachment to the position of Pacification Commissioner of Guangxi and only hoped for a peaceful resolution to avoid war. Huang is scheduled to take a train to the province on the 15th to meet with Chiang. Hope for a peaceful resolution to the Guangxi situation has not been extinguished.

<p>(Jiujiang) Guling telephone report: A Central News Agency reporter visited Minister Kong and Song Zi'liang at 10:00 AM on the 14th. Minister Kong was convening a meeting with Song Zi'liang, Xu Kan, and Chen Jie to continue discussing financial issues and had no time to meet. According to Secretary Chen Liting, although the financial and monetary issues of Guangdong Province have been discussed several times, the specific measures are still under study, and the detailed content has not yet reached the stage of publication. It is rumored that in addition to Kong, Song, Xu, and Chen, those who participated in the meeting at Kong's residence on the morning of the 14th also included Gu Yiqun, Guo Bingwen, Wu Qiding, Bei Songsun, Chen Liting, and Xu Jianping.

(Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Xu Kan and Others Will Fly to Guangdong Today</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) Guling telephone report: A Central News Agency reporter visited Vice Minister Xu Kan at his hotel on the evening of the 14th. According to him, Minister Kong originally intended to personally go to Guangdong to instruct on the reorganization of Guangdong's financial and monetary issues, but because the Executive Yuan still had government affairs to deal with and had to preside over a Yuan meeting, he could not spare the time at this time. Therefore, it was decided to send Director Song and himself first. Those traveling together also include Chen Hang, Chen Guangfu, Gu Yiqun, and Dai Mingli. The reform plan for Guangdong's currency system must be determined after everything is verified in Guangdong and instructions are sought from the two Yuan presidents, Chiang and Kong. The demarcation of Guangdong's taxes and national taxes will be determined and handled in accordance with the principles of national and local division. There are particularly numerous categories of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies in the province. The Ministry of Finance has previously instructed the Guangdong Finance Department that all taxes that harm the people should be abolished. Director Song has carried out abolishment in accordance with the Central Government's intention to relieve the suffering of the people of Guangdong, and many types have already been abolished, and the list will be reported later. Regarding the reorganization of salt affairs administration, Special Commissioner Song has a plan to reorganize anti-smuggling, which will be announced soon. Regarding the detailed rules for the implementation of income tax, the Yuan meeting on the 27th will be attended by the relevant ministers for review, and the content will not be disclosed before it is passed. Furthermore, the reporter learned that Xu Kan, Song Ziliang, Chen Guangfu, Chen Hang, Gu Yiqun, Dai Mingli, and others are scheduled to leave Guling for Xun on the morning of the 15th and fly to Guangdong from Xun. They are expected to arrive in Guangzhou around 2:00 PM that afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Meeting; Gambling Ban Case Handed Over to the Civil and Financial Departments; Draft Regulations to Be Approved and Implemented</h3>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Anti-Smoking Association is scheduled to be established on the 25th. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to various Chinese newspapers here, all contracts previously signed by the Guangdong Provincial Government with foreign commercial firms have been invalidated and new contracts will be signed to replace them. In the past, all contracts in Guangdong concerning construction and industry were handled by the Construction Department, but later Lin Yunkai was responsible in the name of the provincial chairman. Now, the new Construction Department Director, Liu Weizhi, is engaged in reviewing contracts previously signed with foreign merchants. There are currently more than 15 foreign engineers employed in factories in Guangdong, and whether to continue employing them after their contracts expire is currently under consideration. The new Chairman Huang Musong, while acknowledging that the annual revenue of Guangdong Province will decrease by 20 million yuan after the abolition of opium and gambling taxes, believes that the province's annual expenditures can also be reduced by 40 to 50 million yuan. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Flies Back to Hankou; Says the Situation in Sichuan is Currently Very Peaceful; Liu Xiang Absolutely Supports the Central Government</h3>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun completed his mission in Sichuan and returned to Hankou by plane on the 14th from Wanxian, accompanied by Yang Cheng, a senator of the Military Council. He told reporters that this trip to Sichuan was to present the flag of the Tenth Army Corps on behalf of Chiang. He visited Chongqing, Wanxian, and Fuling, but did not go to Chengdu. The situation in Sichuan is very peaceful, and Liu Xiang absolutely supports the Central Government. He is currently ill in Chengdu. Rumors about Sichuan are malicious and intended by villains and are not credible. Xu Yuanquan is stationed in Chongqing, went to Wanxian with him, and has now returned to Chongqing. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After presenting the flag in Wanxian, He Chengjun originally planned to fly to Chengdu on the 13th, but due to a recurrence of hemorrhoids, he flew to Hankou on the morning of the 14th. The trip to Chengdu is said to have been canceled. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Prince De Returns to Pangjiang; Japanese Troops in Chengde Deployed to Northern Chahar; More Than 20 Japanese Aircraft Conduct Exercises in Dolon; Rumors of Gathering Bandit Troops on the Chahar-Suiyuan Border Still Rampant</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign news: Prince De returned to Pangjiang a few days ago, and there seem to have been important meetings in recent days. Representatives of the puppet regime and a certain country are frequently coming and going. Prince De is currently sending personnel to recruit young Mongol soldiers in eastern Mongolia and is actively training them with officers from a certain country. The current strength of the Mongol army is said to be eight divisions, including the First Army under Li Shouxin with three divisions, the Second Army under Bao Guiheng with two divisions, and another independent division and two independent brigades. Prince De and Bao Yueqing are commanders of the 66th and 2nd Divisions. Most of the firearms are supplied by a certain country without compensation, but the number of soldiers in each division is not up to full strength. Regarding the recent situation in eastern Suiyuan, rumors are still rampant. Li Shouxin and Fu's army are still in confrontation. It is rumored that nearly all of the 2,000 Japanese troops in Chengde have been deployed to northern Chahar, and more than 20 Japanese aircraft in Dolon suddenly conducted exercises, inspecting the Chahar-Suiyuan border from time to time. It is also rumored that after the interruption of the Japanese Xin-Zhang route, a small number of Russian troops were suddenly discovered in the area of Olon Khuduk, about 200 li northwest of Bailingmiao, carrying tank cars. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The total number of bandits and puppet troops gathered on the Chahar-Suiyuan border is approximately 7,000 to 8,000, calling themselves the Mongolian Border Defense Autonomous Army, with the most gathered in the area of Shikouzi in Shangdu. Li Shouxin himself is now in Shangdu, recruiting bandits who were previously defeated by our army, attempting to rise again. Since the bandit army launched its attacks, the local areas of the counties in northern Chahar have become even more dilapidated. Kidnapping, extortion, and requisitioning of grain and grass occur almost every day. Many local residents, unable to bear the ravages, have fled. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Imai, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, said that the Mongolian bandit problem in eastern Suiyuan was caused by Fu Zuoyi sending troops to suppress bandits. The rumor that the Japanese side assisted the Mongolian bandits is not true. Kawayoe left Shanghai for the north on the 13th, and will stop and inspect in Jinan and Qingdao, and meet with local officials. He is expected to arrive in Beiping around the 17th to meet with embassy staff and visit the authorities in various locations, and will return to Tianjin after staying for a day or two. The major reshuffle of the Japanese army will be implemented in August. Staff Officer Nagami of the Tianjin Japanese Army has been recalled to his country, and his successor, Staff Officer Hashimoto, is expected to arrive in Tianjin on the 17th. Nagami will return to his country on the 23rd. Matsumuro's previous visit to Jinan to meet with Han Fuju was a routine inspection and there were no special contacts. He did not know the details of North China economic cooperation and the Cangshi Railway construction. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Major Imai, the Japanese military attache, met with reporters here today and said that the rumors about the war in eastern Suiyuan were greatly exaggerated. The incident that occurred was merely a local bandit disturbance. Imai denied that the Li Shouxin troops, who seized six counties in northern Chahar last year, had assisted the bandits, and said that there was no basis for the Chinese report that two Japanese army regiments had arrived in Zhangbei. There are currently no Japanese troops in Chahar. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Disappearance of a German Reporter in Inner Mongolia is Unclear</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the German journalist Paul Shih disappeared in Mongolia, German reporters stationed in Beiping telegraphed Prince De to inquire about the truth, but had not received a reply as of the afternoon of the 14th. The German reporter Miller-Berlin went to Mongolia on the 13th to investigate the truth, but no telegram has arrived in Beiping, so the truth about the disappearance is unclear. Reuters reporter Oliver also went to Mongolia on the afternoon of the 14th to investigate. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the General Situation in South China</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian today carried an editorial criticizing the general situation in South China, saying that Chiang's unification of all of China not yet touched by Japan will eventually achieve a great victory, and Chiang has been engaged in this undertaking for ten years. Whether his policies can create a new China is another matter, but if it does not overstep the boundaries, it is also a very great achievement. Now, if China can be allowed to be at peace and the frequent pressure exerted by Japan can be removed, then Chiang will be able to bring his revival policy to fruition, but this hope is hardly imaginable.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Arita's Diplomatic Report</h3>
<p>— Suitable</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Arita provided a detailed explanation of current foreign policy on the 11th at a cabinet meeting. Analyzed, his beautiful diplomatic rhetoric boils down to the following points: (1) To strive to ease direct conflicts with Britain and the Soviet Union. (2) The continental policy, with China as the primary target, must be actively promoted, and the plan to establish an "ideal zone" in North China must especially be realized. (3) To strive to prevent close relations between China and the Soviet Union. (4) To use military force as a backing for diplomacy.</p>
<p>We do not see any new changes in Japan's policy toward China here. However, this speech fully reflects the sharpening of the Anglo-Japanese conflict, Japan's vigilance toward the Soviet Union, and the crisis caused by the international arms race within Japan.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has maintained a psychology of arrogance and conceit. In order to monopolize East Asia, it reluctantly abandoned its former friend, Britain. In order to please the international imperialists, it did not hesitate to make a show of force, taking on the role of a vanguard in attacking the Soviet Union. But now, the conflict of interests between Britain and Japan in the Far East has become so acute that it is irreconcilable. Moreover, Britain's economic assistance to China and its cooperation with the Soviet Union have made Japan deeply feel its own isolation. As for the Soviet Union, it has already expanded its military strength in the Far East to an alarming extent, which has also made it impossible for Japan to cope with the arms race. Therefore, Japan has once again felt the importance of improving relations with Britain and the Soviet Union, and the diplomatic authorities have had to make some efforts in this regard.</p>
<p>However, such efforts by the Japanese diplomatic authorities will probably be in vain as long as the traditional policy toward China continues. Because the fundamental reason for the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Japan and Britain and Japan and the Soviet Union is obviously that set of traditional policies.</p>
<p>Judging from Foreign Minister Arita's speech, Japan will not abandon its traditional policy toward China. He suggested the realization of the plan to establish an "ideal zone" in North China. What is this plan like? Perhaps we can gain some concrete understanding from the recent facts of the two attacks by the Meng puppet army under Li Shouxin on the territory of Taolin County in Suiyuan East.</p>
<p>Li Shouxin's troops are trained by Japanese officers. This puppet army is equipped with new-style tanks and artillery, which are also supplied by the Japanese army. Although they have invaded Suiyuan East twice, they have been repelled by Fu Zuoyi's troops. However, the Japanese army in Chahar North is still rushing to build roads and airfields. The puppet troops in Hebei East and Jehol are also heading towards the Chahar North area. The crisis in Suiyuan East is only intensifying day by day.</p>
<p>Japan is obviously using the Mongol bandits and puppet troops to establish another puppet organization, the "Mongol State," in the sparsely populated Inner Mongolia. Isn't this part of the plan for the ideal zone in North China that Foreign Minister Arita mentioned?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the interests of the entire nation, we will never tolerate this kind of plan and the entire continental policy of Japan. Our most urgent task today is to use all our strength to prevent all separatist movements in North China. As for diplomacy, no matter how Japan relies on the backing of military force to hinder our friendship with other powers, we must of course adhere to our own position and hold on to necessary friends.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks to Revise the Inspection Law for Artificial Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from weaving smuggled artificial silk into bolts and selling them domestically as local products, the Ministry of Finance stipulated measures for investigating and clearing artificial silk woven into local product bolts. After the order was issued to the Inspector General of Customs, the Jianghai Customs was scheduled to implement it on the 14th. However, according to a telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, domestic artificial silk fabrics sold in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are purchased in small quantities from local machine households and transferred to various provinces after being sorted out. The machine households purchase silk in small quantities from local firms. The artificial silk has been transferred several times from the original artificial silk importers, and it is difficult to obtain tax bills to exchange for licenses. It is requested that the measures be revised. Before the revision, the Jianghai Customs should be ordered to postpone implementation. Some silk and satin merchants advocate authorizing trade associations to handle inspection and registration and issue certificates to replace the customs inspection and clearing. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance believes that the points raised by all parties are not unreasonable, and on the 14th telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs to review and propose relief measures. As for the request that the Jianghai Customs postpone implementation, the Inspector General of Customs was also ordered to investigate the situation and consider it. As for authorizing trade associations to inspect and clear, whether there are any malpractices and whether it can be applied to the whole country remains to be studied in detail.

<h3>British-Japanese Cooperation Issue Japanese Power Expands in China British Suspicions Are Difficult to Dissipate</h3>
<p>(London) Although the issue of promoting diplomatic relations between Britain and Japan has received serious attention from all sectors of British society, it is generally believed that a basis for British-Japanese cooperation has not yet been found. Political and press circles are clearly silent when discussing any practical plans. However, it does not seem that the idea of international loans to China will be seriously advocated again. The proposal advocated by diplomatic circles to assist China in undertaking water conservancy projects to reduce floods and improve police administration to quell banditry is also seen as likely to cause significant difficulties. The power of Japanese extremist elements continues to expand, and the British are increasingly suspicious of them. To dispel these suspicions, it is necessary to present facts, and empty words alone will not be effective. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Continuous Japanese Aggression Against China World War Opportunity Lurks - Observations of Dr. Hu Shi - Pan-Pacific Society to Open Soon - French Political Views of the League of Nations Representative</h3>

Japan has deliberately obstructed China's unification. Over the past three years, Japanese policy has focused on weakening the power of the Chinese central government. The North China Autonomous Movement, the Eastern Hebei Independence Movement, the puppet army's invasion of Chahar, the rumors of Inner Mongolian independence, and the current smuggling in North China are all manifestations of this policy. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>San Francisco The Pan-Pacific Society will open this week at Yosemite National Park in the United States. Mr. Lennox, the League of Nations inspector who arrived here today, discussed French politics, saying that France has not become a communist party. Communists have now been Frenchified. This is the truth of the French Popular Front government. The Popular Front government does not advocate revolution domestically and does not advocate war externally. Its policies are similar to the British New Deal, not like socialism. French Prime Minister Blum is also striving to emulate President Roosevelt, not Soviet leaders. Therefore, Blum is not the Kerensky of Russia, but the Roosevelt of the United States. It is noted that Lennox is French and has served as the director of the League of Nations office in Paris for ten years. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>

<h3>Southern Rebel Army in Spain Advances Towards Malaga Western Route Besieges the Important Town of Badajoz Official Army Defends the City and is Difficult to Hold for Long</h3>
<p>Port of Rabat, French Africa Our correspondent's special dispatch The majority of the southern route army of General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebel army, is composed of foreign legion troops. They recently defeated the official army in Marbella, 40 kilometers south of the port of Malaga, and seized many cannons and a large number of munitions. They immediately continued their advance towards the port of Malaga. Several columns of the western route rebel army advanced to the outskirts of the city of Badajoz (the capital of the province of Badajoz) last night and have already besieged it. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Seville Rebel leader General Franco has begun his advance from the south on Madrid today, ordering his subordinates to divide into three teams and advance north, intending to take Malaga first and then head straight for the capital. Troops from nearby cities are also joining along the way. Rebel leader General Lano in the area predicts that the rebels can win within two weeks. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Seville The several columns of revolutionary troops attacking the city of Badajoz have already arrived under the city, and have cut off the electricity. Therefore, the entire city was pitch black last night. The rebels sent three planes to bomb the city. The official army is now defending the city, and it is difficult to hold for long. Residents fleeing the city to take refuge were shot and killed by communist militiamen when they reached the Portuguese border. Now, except for the city of Badajoz, which is still holding on, the entire province is under the control of the revolutionary army. General Franco, commander-in-chief of the southern route, can also directly contact General Mullah on the northern route. According to a report in the Lisbon Daily News from Huelva City, the governor of Badajoz Province has fled to the Portuguese border, which shows that the rebels in the province have indeed succeeded. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Lisbon The local radio broadcasting company recently issued a message saying that according to reliable sources, the Spanish government has now requested a certain foreign government to mediate between the government army and the rebels. It also said that the city of Badajoz has been besieged by the revolutionary army for a long time, and it has almost fallen by this morning. It is heard that several armored vehicles have entered the city. The leader of the Socialist Party in the city, Vasquez, has been arrested by the revolutionary army. The city of Merida to its east and west was captured by the revolutionary army a few days ago. Recently, three planes belonging to the government army went to drop bombs, but no one was killed. As for the port of Algeciras, it is heard that another 2,000 rebels have crossed the sea from Moroccan Africa and landed there. In addition, the revolutionary army in Seville, which is advancing towards the province of Malaga, has indeed occupied the city of Antequera in the province and is now advancing towards the city of Malaga.

<h3>Northern and Southern Fronts: Government Troops Fight with All Their Strength; "Jaime I" Battleship Sunk</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: Regarding the situation of the Spanish war, although the rebel side claims to have won victories today, the government troops are putting up a strong resistance. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict the final outcome. According to reports from the rebel-held radio stations in Seville, Tetouan, and Ceuta, the government's cruiser "Jaime I" was recently sunk by rebel aircraft near the port of Malaga. (Note: "Jaime I" previously led other ships to bombard and severely damage the port of Algeciras, west of Gibraltar.) Regarding this battle, a special correspondent from our newspaper stationed in Malaga witnessed rebel aircraft dropping bombs that directly hit the deck of the ship and fell into the bow. It killed one sailor and injured five others. At that time, all warships docked in the port opened fire on the aircraft with anti-aircraft guns, and the plane quickly escaped. It is found that the coastal area of ​​Malaga Province is adjacent to the four provinces of Cadiz, Seville, Cordoba, and Granada, which are occupied by the rebels on its northwest, east, and three sides. Although the government troops are now holding their ground, they are surrounded by the rebels as if trapped in the heart of the enemy. It is learned that the government troops in the province are now planning to attack the city of Granada in the northeast with all their strength, in order to eliminate the rebels in the entire province of Granada and open a way out. However, according to rebel radio reports, the rebels also intend to attack Malaga Province. Therefore, a major battle is imminent there. In addition, on the northern front in Gipuzkoa Province, the rebels are fiercely bombarding the city of San Sebastian, killing many government troops. According to rumors, the rebel warship "Admiral Cervera" has arrived outside the port of San Sebastian. The captain of the ship issued a final ultimatum to the government troops in the city, giving them until midnight today to surrender the city, otherwise they will open fire and bombard the city. However, this statement has not been confirmed. As for the area around Irun, several rebel aircraft flew to bomb, but no one was hit. Regarding the battle news there, the government troops claimed to have occupied the city of Fontarabia near Irun, while the rebels said that the government troops stationed in the port of Bilbao are already in a desperate situation. The news from both sides is contradictory. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Seville: The matter of the government cruiser "Jaime I" being destroyed by rebel aircraft near the port of Malaga was confirmed by a radio broadcast from here this morning. It was also stated that the troops under General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, won victories along the way in their attack on the port of Malaga, and that the militia defending the port had been completely defeated. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Tolosa: After the rebels occupied this place, they launched a fierce attack on San Sebastian today with elite troops, hoping to cut off the government's line of communication and relieve the siege of Oviedo. They have now advanced to a location 11 miles south of San Sebastian. Another column advanced to a location 11 miles southeast of San Sebastian. The rebel leaders predict that they will be able to capture the city within this week. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the South: Three Rebel Columns Converge on Malaga; General Franco Commands Personally</h3>
<p>Madrid: Although there is no temporary victory or defeat on either side of the Guadarrama front north of the capital, the fighting in the south is still intense. After the rebels carried out an air raid on Badajoz yesterday, they are now approaching the town. According to news from Lisbon, several armored vehicles have penetrated into the heart of the town. Although the labor militia is still fighting hard to resist, the town is in danger of being captured by the rebels at any time. The civil governor of Badajoz has now crossed into Portugal, exhausted and almost unable to support himself. Suffering from heart disease, he will be hospitalized for treatment. It is claimed that the governor is not a Communist and has long wanted to escape, but the party members threatened him and planned to put him to death if he tried to escape. Therefore, he dared not do so for a long time. He took the opportunity of yesterday's air raid and the confusion of the crowd to escape from Badajoz. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Seville: A rebel column today was personally commanded by General Franco, the commander-in-chief, to attack Malaga. The first column of 1,000 men headed straight for the destination from Gibraltar. The second and third columns advanced towards Antequera and Ronda. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: Government troops and rebels engaged in fierce fighting today at the mouth of the Guadalhorce River near Malaga. About 300 people died on both sides. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Guadarrama Mountains: Government Air Force Drops Bombs</h3>
<p>Madrid: Special dispatch from our correspondent accompanying the army on the Guadarrama mountain front north of the capital. Yesterday, the artillery and aircraft of the government army carried out bombing on the rebels in the area. Apart from this, there is nothing else to report. The government troops are now worried that the rebels may attack the city of El Escorial, and have sent a column led by Colonel Sabio to the town of San Rafael to stop the rebels' advance. Currently, the rebel side lacks bombs. This can be seen from the fact that the rebel aircraft are throwing artillery shells instead of bombs. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Both Sides Purchase Aircraft from Abroad</h3>
<p>(London) Two Dutch transport planes and four British transport planes departed from Croydon Airport for Spain. According to the Standard Evening News, the two Dutch planes are Fokker three-engine giant planes, each capable of carrying 16 passengers. Their destination is Burgos, the location of the Spanish rebel "National Defense Government." Among the four British planes, two are "Swift" type, and their recipients are also the Spanish rebels. The other two are "Dragon" type, which were purchased by the Madrid government. The newspaper also stated that both the Spanish government and the rebels have sent personnel to Britain and have been staying here for several days. They have already purchased aircraft from various aircraft manufacturers at high prices. Pilots who are willing to serve in Spain will be paid 125 pounds each. Officials are now declaring about this matter that the British government has no right to prohibit the export of commercial aircraft, and according to British law, the Ministry of Commerce has no right to prohibit the export of any goods. However, after a general non-intervention agreement is concluded, appropriate measures will be taken to ban them. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>General Mola Arrives in Seville</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: According to a broadcast from the rebel radio station in Seville, General Mola, the commander of the rebel army in northern Spain, has arrived in Seville to discuss offensive matters with General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>The Rebel Flag is Red and Yellow: Representing Blood and Gold</h3>
<p>Madrid: According to War Bulletin No. 16 issued by General Mola, the commander of the rebel army in northern Spain, in the city of Burgos, several columns of the rebel army have set out from the Vilella area and arrived in the town of Guadalajala north of the capital, heading towards the city of Madrid. In addition, all cities occupied by the rebels will hang the red and yellow flag tomorrow to celebrate the victory. The red and yellow colors represent blood and gold, and are designated by the rebel authorities as the official flag. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italian Air Force Conducts Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Tyrrhenian Sea</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Air Force is currently conducting large-scale maneuvers in the Tyrrhenian Sea (southwest of the peninsula, between Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the mainland). Yesterday, 200 military aircraft, led by General Feffenesgori, went to participate. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Take Concrete Action to Ban Civilian Aircraft from Being Transported to Spain</h3>
<p>(London) The British government has begun an investigation today in order to prevent British civilian aircraft from being transported to Spain. It is currently considering taking concrete action to stop it, without waiting for other countries to take the same steps. According to current laws, it is difficult to implement a ban. However, it may be possible to impose a ban by expanding the list of goods that require a license to be exported abroad through a cabinet meeting, or by applying indirect pressure to exporters. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Behind the Spanish Civil War: A Struggle Between Democracy and Fascism; Closely Related to France's Interests; Solid Evidence of Italian and German Aid to the Rebels</h3>
<p>Toulouse, France: Spanish President Azaña recently gave a speech to a special correspondent from the Czech newspaper stationed in the capital, saying, "France's interests are closely related to Spain, more so than ever before. If the Spanish rebels win, what will become of our country's people? What position will our country take among the great powers? In fact, I am afraid that it will be reduced to a subordinate of other countries. I believe that the French border is no longer the towering Pyrenees, but the Guadarrama Mountains near Madrid, where Republicans and Fascists are fighting a decisive battle. If the Fascists win, the southern border of France will be difficult to rest easy in the future. Not only that, but the Balearic Islands and the Spanish port of Ceuta in Morocco can become strong naval bases. Once other countries occupy them, what changes will occur in the Mediterranean situation, and what impact will it have on the communication lines between mainland France and its African territories? I hope that the French people, regardless of party affiliation, will carefully consider the pros and cons before making a judgment." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Seville: Associated Press correspondent Hall reported today that there is considerable evidence that Italy and Germany are providing strong assistance to the Spanish rebels. After arriving here, he confirmed that there are indeed many new-style Italian and German aircraft, piloted by Italian and German officers, under the command of General Franco. However, because he could not get close to the airfield, he did not know the exact number of aircraft. It is rumored here that there are at least more than 100 aircraft. German officers wear white uniforms, while Italian officers wear the uniforms of Spanish troops stationed abroad. When they pass through the streets, the residents cheer them and give Fascist salutes. In addition, there are Fascist youth groups parading through the city on horseback, killing anyone suspected of being a Communist. Even music and songs are only allowed to use Fascist tunes. On Friday, the imperial era flag will be raised here. General Franco will also attend the flag-raising ceremony at that time. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Germany Intentionally Delay the Non-Intervention Agreement; The Matter of German Aircraft Being Detained is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler is now very concerned about the events in Spain. He is reluctant to take any rash steps regarding the neutrality issue. The diplomatic circles here also share this impression. The latest news from Spain is sent to Hitler several times a day. It is believed that Hitler must have decided not to take any action for the time being because the news is constantly changing. According to well-informed German sources, Germany is now extremely eager to declare that it is maintaining neutrality, but because it is increasingly doubtful as to whether Spain still has a legitimate government, it has been slow to make this announcement. In addition, Germany still regards the case of the seven German nationals who died in the Spanish civil strife as not yet satisfactorily resolved. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the draft agreement on non-interference in the Spanish civil strife proposed by France, it was recently claimed by semi-official sources here that the German government's reply has not yet been sent. Regarding the matter of German aircraft being detained by the Spanish government, negotiations are still underway between here and the Madrid government. Although five aircraft belonging to Lufthansa Airlines have been returned (note: these five aircraft fly between Madrid and Alicante and specialize in transporting German nationals out of the country, and were requisitioned by the Spanish government), one Junkers three-engine bomber was forced to land in Achaga, Badajoz Province, Spain, due to running out of fuel, and is still being detained by the Spanish authorities near the city of Madrid and has not been returned. This is one of the reasons why Germany has not been satisfied regarding the aircraft incident. In addition, political figures claimed that Germany's attitude towards the non-intervention issue will depend on the progress of the Spanish civil strife and whether the Spanish government can control anarchists and communists. This is the second reason why Germany has been slow to submit its reply. Furthermore, the case of four National Socialist Youth Party members who were killed outside the village of San Martín in Barcelona, ​​Spain, has recently been discussed together with the aircraft incident, and the government has requested the Spanish government to satisfy it. This is also an obstacle to the non-intervention agreement. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italian Reservation; Content of the French Reply; British and French Negotiations Reach a Compromise</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to semi-official sources, the content of France's reply to Italy's reservation is as follows: (1) Italy's first reservation advocates prohibiting financial assistance to any warring parties in Spain, and that all kinds of donations should be banned. Regarding this, France replied that purely private donations aimed at helping the wounded cannot be prohibited by law. (2) Italy's second reservation advocates prohibiting people from all countries from enlisting in any warring parties in Spain to help them fight. Regarding this, France replied that people who voluntarily enlist should be allowed. (Note: Foreign Minister Delbos also explained this view at yesterday's cabinet meeting.) In addition, regarding the matter of the Spanish government detaining German bomber aircraft (in Achaga, Badajoz Province), the German government requested the Spanish authorities to return the aircraft, and made this a prerequisite for accepting the non-intervention agreement draft proposed by France. According to semi-official news, the French government has given friendly advice to the Madrid government, urging it to accept Germany's request. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is generally known that Italy's second answer will be submitted at the earliest at the end of next week. (Note: August 15 is the Catholic Feast of the Assumption of Mary, and August 16 is Sunday, both of which are holidays.) (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, representatives from Britain and France conducted overnight negotiations yesterday. According to semi-official news, these negotiations have been completed. The two governments will exchange letters tonight or tomorrow, at which time a formal agreement between the two countries can be established. The content of the agreement roughly maintains the draft non-intervention agreement proposed by France (advocating that the signatory countries shall not sell various military armaments, military and civilian aircraft, and various warships to Spain or Spanish Morocco), and is supplemented by a reservation proposed by the United Kingdom, that is, when this agreement is implemented in the United Kingdom, it shall not conflict with existing British laws. British and French political figures hope that after the two countries adopt a common position, Germany and Italy will be influenced and accept this agreement, so that a method of implementation of a similar nature can be drafted. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain Can Do Nothing to Help France</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations on concluding an agreement on non-interference in the Spanish civil war, Germany, Italy, and Portugal have all put forward reservations. (Note: The reservation put forward by Germany is that the aircraft detention incident should be given a satisfactory reply by the Spanish government. The Italian reservations are to prohibit financial support to the two warring parties in Spain and to prohibit people from voluntarily enlisting to help the two warring parties in Spain fight. The Portuguese reservations include three items: (1) The two warring parties in Spain should respect the neutral status of the port of Tangier, (2) Soviet Russia should accept the non-intervention agreement at the same time as other countries, and (3) Britain and France should guarantee the territorial integrity of Portugal.) Political figures here believe that each of these countries is now doing its best to help the Spanish rebels, hoping that the rebels will quickly win the final victory, so they are doing everything possible to delay the negotiations on concluding a non-intervention agreement in order to delay the time. Now the French public opinion is extremely angry about the actions of foreign countries in helping the Spanish rebels, which makes the position of the French government very difficult, and the situation is becoming more serious. In the British government, the assistance that has been given to France in making representations has already been exhausted and has not achieved results, so it can do nothing to help and can no longer influence the attitudes of Germany and Italy. Currently, left-wing people here are quite anxious about the current situation, while the right-wing clearly favors the Spanish rebels and obstructs the government's actions. Is this why the government only compromises and cannot take other measures? (Havas Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Content of the Portuguese Reply is Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Lisbon: After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here received a letter from France proposing the establishment of an agreement not to interfere in the Spanish civil strife, it has recently issued a reply and sent it to the French Minister Amelro. According to well-informed sources, this reply is quite satisfactory. (Havas Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: The French government previously sent a note to our government, advocating the conclusion of an agreement on non-interference in the Spanish civil war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently declared that the Danish government will not issue export licenses for any military armaments transported to Spain. It also said that Denmark is very willing to participate in the non-intervention agreement, but only if this agreement can be unanimously accepted by all countries and has a general nature. (Havas Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>French and Polish Military Leaders Hold a Meeting in Warsaw</h3>
<p>Warsaw: After French Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin arrived here last night, he held the first formal meeting with General Riz-Smigly, Chief Inspector of the Army, at 4:30 this afternoon. Minister of Military Affairs General Kasprzycki and Army Chief of Staff General Stachiewicz (yesterday's dispatch mistakenly wrote General Gonsegroski) were also present. First, General Gamelin and General Riz-Smigly expressed their opinions. The generals present also spoke one after another, and the meeting did not end until 7:00 in the evening. It is generally believed that since the late French General Foch (Allied Commander-in-Chief during the European War) came here in 1923, General Gamelin is the first military leader from that country to visit here, so today's meeting is extremely important. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Mamoru Shigemitsu Will Succeed Ota as Japanese Ambassador to Russia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Ota to Russia returned to the country on the 13th. Foreign Minister Arita, because Ambassador Ota has always expressed his intention to resign, decided to take this opportunity to replace the ambassador to Russia. Regarding the issue of his successor, the Foreign Minister formally solicited Ambassador Ota's opinion, but already had a policy of appointing Mamoru Shigemitsu. When Prime Minister Hirota concurrently served as Foreign Minister, he originally planned to appoint Ouya Bureau Chief Togo as the ambassador to Russia, and also internally decided to appoint Shigemitsu as the ambassador to China. However, due to opposition from a certain aspect to Shigemitsu's appointment as the ambassador to China, this matter was abandoned. Since then, Shigemitsu resigned from the position of Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs until today. Foreign Minister Arita considered this situation and expressed sympathy for Shigemitsu, so he decided to appoint Shigemitsu as the ambassador to Russia. According to Shigemitsu, he is the most knowledgeable person in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Chinese affairs. After the Manchurian Incident, he served as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and went through diplomatic difficulties. Japanese diplomacy with Russia and its China policy have a subtle relationship, so Shigemitsu is the most suitable person to be the ambassador to Russia. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italian Mechanized Army Loses its Effectiveness in Heavy Rain; Arsi People Guerrilla Warfare; Italian Army Weary</h3>
<p>(London) Abyssinian Minister to Britain Dr. Martin said today that he learned from reliable sources in Djibouti that the Italian army in Abyssinia is facing increasing difficulties due to heavy rain and frequent attacks by Abyssinian small-team soldiers. Italian aircraft and mechanized armies cannot be used due to the rain. The people of the Abyssinian capital are now relying entirely on the French Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway to supply food.

<h3>Britain Recruits New Soldiers: Quota of 17,000 to Begin Next Month; Actively Cultivating Air Force Pilots</h3>
<p>(London) Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper previously decided to recruit new soldiers by official proclamation to replenish the reserve army of infantry and form elite troops to strengthen national defense. It is learned that the recruitment of these new soldiers will begin on September 1 at the Ulverston Barracks. The quota is initially set at 17,000. The age of applicants is from 17 to 25 years old. The term of service is set at six years. In the first year, the service is 26 weeks. In the next five years, the service is two weeks each year. Duff Cooper also announced that the government will compile pre-commissioned air force pilots. These pilots will first receive training for a period of one year, and those who pass the examination will be assigned to the active air force with the temporary title of pilot for a period of one year. After the expiration of the term, they will be assigned to the reserve team. Within five years, they will continue to receive training for a certain period of time to improve their skills and achieve proficiency. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

Both princesses will go to various residences this week, and the King of England will also visit the place. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Southwestern Fujian: Communist Bandits Being Cleared Out; Zhang Changshui Flees to Sanping; Wu Ming’s Gang Flees to the Borders of Xianyou; Lu Zhenshan’s Gang to be Enlisted</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Communist bandits in western Fujian and the Zhangzhou region, along with local bandits in the Quanzhou region of southern Fujian, have been rampaging fiercely in the past month, especially in late July. The Pacification Headquarters has begun a planned suppression. In the Quanzhou region, after the 75th Division's Water Regiment and the 9th Security Regiment entered Anxi and recovered Hutou, the Security Department approved the enlistment of Lu Zhenshan's group, the largest gang in Anxi, as a mobile brigade, limited to 300 men. The remaining firearms are to be handed over to the Security Department for storage. After enlistment, they will be stationed in Anxi, responsible for maintaining security in the border areas of the four counties of Hua'an, Zhangping, Changtai, and [another illegible character] County. Lu's force will be immediately concentrated in Changkeng. Anxi County Magistrate Cheng Zaoling, Security Department Adjutant Lin Qian, and Xie Baoming, the 3rd Battalion Commander of the 5th Security Regiment, went to Changkeng on the 7th to inspect the troops and weapons, numbering over 400, and are awaiting instructions from the Security Department. Lu's force is one of the largest local bandit groups in the Quanzhou region. With Lu's enlistment, not only will the bandit problem in Anxi be resolved, but the bandit scourge in the Quanzhou region can also be considered to have come to an end. Over one hundred bandits under Peng Ming and Wu Wu, who captured the towns of Tanbian and Putou in Nan'an County, were besieged on the 10th in Badu by the 1st Battalion of the 75th Division's Water Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the Shao Regiment, divided into three routes. By noon on the 11th, Wu's bandits had fled to the border of Xianyou County, and the troops are still in pursuit. Only small groups of local bandits remain in the Quanzhou region, which should not be difficult to pacify. As for the Communist bandits in western Fujian and the Zhangzhou region, the entire 75th Division began encircling them on the 9th and 10th. Zhang Changshui's bandit gang, operating between Nan'jing and Zhangpu in the Zhangzhou region along the Longzhao Road, was repeatedly engaged and defeated. They have retreated to their old nests in the Daping, Sanping, and Wuzhai areas. Shuimo, Qingguolin, and other places have been successively recovered. Wu Jin's water bandit gang in Wushanping, Yunxiao County, numbering over 300, is based in various areas of the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th districts. They have also retreated into the deep mountains of the 2nd and 5th districts after being encircled by troops. Qiu Jinsheng's fake 8th Regiment in Longyan, western Fujian, numbering over one hundred, attacked Xiage Township in Longyan on the 9th, entering the town to loot. They were driven back after a local militia rushed to assist, resulting in the death of four bandits. Also on the 9th, over one hundred bandits ambushed a tram near Shishe, Shizhong, on the Zhanglong Road. The 57th Brigade's escort team engaged them, but due to overwhelming numbers, retreated into a bunker, resulting in the death of a platoon leader. The bandits in western Fujian are under the direct command of Zhang Dingcheng and are causing disturbances between Longyan and Yongding. The 9th Division under Li Yannian is currently responsible for suppressing them. Currently, the Communist bandits in western Fujian include five gangs: Qiu Jinsheng's fake 8th Regiment, Xiao Zhenzhong's Independent Battalion of the fake 8th Regiment, Wei Xingshui's fake 9th Regiment, Xie Kunxiu's Guerrilla Detachment of the fake Yanyongjing Regiment, and Xie Shaodeng and Xie Chenghui's fake Allied Army. They are active in the areas of Yanyong County and near Shizhong on the Zhanglong Road. Except for Qiu Jinsheng's gang, which is larger with approximately several hundred men, the rest have less than one hundred men each, totaling less than one thousand. In the Zhangzhou region, there are Zhang Changshui and Li Tianhui's gangs in Nan'zhan, Wu Jin's gang in Yunxiao, and Yu Qitou's gang in Zhao'an. The highest leadership organization for these bandit-Communist gangs is the fake Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee, headed by Zhang Dingcheng. (August 13th)</p>
<h3>Statistics on Shenyang's Industry Under Japanese Control: Forcibly Buying Out Major Foreign Factories; Small Factories Left to Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Currently, Shenyang's industrial power is entirely in the hands of the Japanese. Most of the larger factories are established by the Japanese. If there are factories established by Chinese or Westerners, the Japanese try every possible means to acquire them with less capital. Otherwise, they sabotage them in various ways, making it impossible for them to survive. As for factories with extremely small capital, the Japanese, in addition to implementing controls, do not want to buy them out and implement trusts, leaving them to rise and fall on their own. This is an old trick of the Japanese to bestow small favors. According to a detailed investigation, the types of factories and the statistics of workers in Shenyang City are as follows:</p>
<p>The above totals include 55 types of factories, 378 factories, 22,596 male workers, 702 Japanese male workers, 258 female workers, and 42 Japanese female workers.</p>
<h3>Hubei Launches General Land Survey, Using the Baojia System to Complete it Within Three Months; Aiming for a Clear Link Between Fields, Households, and Grain; Purpose is to Restore Land and Rectify Tax Amounts</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Hubei Province's land tax has never been systematically organized. Considering the province's total area, which is over 270 million mu (Chinese acres), after deducting mountains, forests, lakes, and rivers, the taxable land should at least reach over 50 million mu. However, the amount of land accounted for by the counties based on grain is only enough to reach 30 million mu. The tax revenue is also difficult to collect in full. The highest amount ever collected was 1.7 million yuan, while the lowest was only 1.2 million yuan. There are countless problems, such as fields without grain, grain without fields, more fields with less grain, fewer fields with more grain, tax evasion by large households, overpayment by small households, and manipulation of records to collect excessive amounts. This has resulted in an uneven burden on the people and a decrease in government revenue, causing losses to both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Successive governments have always relied on likin (internal transit tax) and salt tax surcharges as the main sources of provincial revenue and adopted a laissez-faire approach to land tax. When likin was abolished and salt tax surcharges were transferred to the central government for direct collection, the provincial treasury's annual revenue decreased by 16 to 17 million yuan. It still relied on the central government's special tax subsidy of 500,000 yuan per month and the Ministry of Finance's subsidy of 250,000 yuan to make up for the shortfall. It is by no means certain whether these subsidies can be received for the long term. Once the subsidies are stopped, all government affairs are likely to come to a standstill. Provincial Chairman Yang Yongtai, in order to restore land and rectify tax amounts, is actively reorganizing the system. It has been stipulated that the period from July of this year to June of next year will be the "Land Tax Year." The first step is to survey the land, the second is to improve collection methods, and the third is to establish standards for mu conversion. Currently, the first step of implementing a general land survey is being undertaken. However, land surveys are nothing more than land measurement and land reporting, neither of which can be accomplished in a short period of time. Therefore, after careful consideration, the "Implementation Outline for County Land Surveys" was formulated, submitted to the Provincial Government Council for approval, and ordered to be implemented. The main points are that the county magistrate, together with the district chiefs and lianbao (joint guarantee) chiefs, should divide the baojia (group of ten households) and conduct household surveys to ascertain the true households, true fields, and true grain. At the same time, the household registration should be thoroughly checked according to the established baojia household numbers, so as to achieve the beneficial effect of mutual corroboration between household registration and land registration. On the active side, the county magistrate, district chiefs, lianbao chiefs, and baojia heads will be fully mobilized and work together, focusing on the distribution of tasks, the adjustment of organizations, and the connection of personnel, designating it as the sole central task. On the passive side, obstacles to the progress of the survey should be eliminated, all passive resistance from the people should be suppressed, and rewards and punishments for personnel below the lianbao level should be strictly enforced. Regarding the survey deadline: (1) The jia heads must investigate thoroughly, and the bao heads must re-investigate, and the filled-out reports must be submitted within ten days from the date of receipt of the survey forms. (2) The county magistrate, together with the district chiefs and lianbao chiefs, must separately inquire, review, re-examine, randomly measure, and correct the forms within 48 days. (3) A public announcement will be made for ten days, and the final decision will be made upon expiration. The districts must compile and submit the information to the county within ten days. (4) The compilation of a complete register of household population and land for the entire county, combining mu and determining tax amounts, must be completed within one month. (5) The entire county will be divided into districts and carried out simultaneously, to be completed uniformly within three months. The funding is set at 4,500 yuan for first-class counties, 4,000 yuan for second-class counties, and 3,500 yuan for third-class counties. Those at all levels who work hard and complete the tasks within the deadline will be rewarded with commendations, merits, and promotions. Those who are incompetent, derelict in their duties, or make mistakes will be punished with reprimands, demerits, and dismissals. According to Chairman Yang, this general land survey will use the current baojia area as the basis for the survey, the current baojia personnel as the main force for the survey, and the baojia household registers as the basis for the survey. The fields will be asked about based on the households, and the grain will be asked about based on the fields, so that the fields do not leave the households, the households do not leave the grain, and there is a clear connection between the households, the fields, and the grain. The rich will supplement the poor, so that those with fields pay taxes, those without fields are exempted from taxes, those with more fields but less grain and those with fewer fields but more grain will all be taxed fairly. Large households will have no way to evade taxes, and small households will have their burdens lightened. This is a matter of life and death for Hubei's finances, and it is also an opportunity for the people to bear the burden equally. Therefore, it is determined to promote it with all efforts.

<h3>Songjiang: Automobile Overturns</h3>
<p>The Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company's No. 10 bus, en route from Songjiang to Shanghai's Minnanzha (Southern Shanghai area), carrying more than ten passengers, veered off course near Xindongmen yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM. Due to the driver's carelessness, it plunged into a small ditch on the right side, causing the entire vehicle to overturn. Passengers were covered in mud and sustained minor injuries. The driver, to avoid hitting a village child (named Zhang A'gen, fourteen years old) standing by the road, made a sharp turn, causing the accident. The child was handed over to the company, which then sent him to the Second Public Security Precinct for detention. A team was dispatched to recover and repair the vehicle. Today, the child's father came to Songjiang to try to secure his release.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Bicycle Touring Group Returns to the County</h3>
<p>For the purpose of investigating industry, commerce, and education, Wang Xuanchun, Cao Liwen, Yin Ke, Lu Yunfei, and others from the education sector organized a summer bicycle touring group. They departed on July 5th, travelling through Wuxi and Yixing, and then to Guangde and Xuancheng in Anhui, touring Huangshan. They entered Jiangxi, and made detailed investigations into the Yuele Coal Mining Company in Leping and the resources in Jingdezhen. Then, they went to the southern part of Jiangxi to admire the birthplace of the New Life Movement. Finally, they returned to the county on the 14th via Hangzhou and Shanghai. Many people from all walks of life welcomed them. They took many films of famous scenic spots and industries along the way, which will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau Chief Accused of Soliciting Bribes</h3>
<p>The Kuntai Jia (Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading) Three-County Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Detailed Collection Bureau is located in Nanxiang Town in this county. The newly appointed Bureau Chief, Xia Molin, after taking office on August 1st, summoned the collection directors of the three counties, Huang Songsheng, Shao Zugeng, and Huang Shoumei, and announced the quota for the three counties for the 25th year of the Republic. In addition to the prescribed 58,000 yuan, an additional quota of 15,000 yuan must be paid first before the collection can continue. Huang and others complied with the full quota, but considered the additional quota to be a bribe and refused to pay. Xia continued to demand it and threatened to revoke their appointments. He also said that the additional quota was the income that the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Chief was entitled to, which was known throughout the province. On the 3rd and 11th, Huang and others telegraphed the Ministry of Finance twice, reporting that he was openly soliciting bribes and requesting that an investigator be dispatched.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Recovered Stolen Coal Reported to the Ministry for Instructions</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Wuxian General Labor Union has been actively inspecting for smuggled goods through its anti-smuggling patrol team. The other day, it worked with police officers from the Second Branch of the Third Public Security Bureau to seize over one hundred tons of Liujiang stolen coal at the Naisongji Coal Company's warehouse outside Jinmen. They immediately marked it with white powder and waited for a ruling. However, the coal company denied that it was stolen coal, claiming that it was domestic white coal dust. They reported this to the Coal Industry Association, which in turn reported it to the County Chamber of Commerce on the 14th, requesting that personnel be sent to identify it and return it. The General Labor Union determined that it was indeed stolen coal. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance and requesting instructions, it also dispatched personnel on the 14th to conduct an investigation at the coal company along with Inspector Cui from the police district. The director of the company, Ni Songyun, also surrendered himself to the police district on the same day to explain everything. It was initially planned to detain him, but because it was not yet certain whether the coal was stolen, he was ordered to return home and await the ruling of the competent authorities.</p>
<h3>Rushing to Complete Citizen Oath</h3>
<p>The county government received an order to conduct citizen oath registration. Because the deadline was approaching, all districts were ordered to speed up the process. The oath registration of civil servants and baojia heads of various townships has been completed at Zhongshan Hall on the 13th and 14th. Ordinary citizens must take the oath at their respective township offices before 6:00 PM on the 15th, or they will lose their citizenship. Therefore, the work of the township offices on the 14th was very intense.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Managers of Two Native Product Companies Detained</h3>
<p>The two native product companies in this county, Tongsheng and Xiecheng, privately raised soil prices last year for as long as eighteen months. After an investigation by the provincial authorities, they were each fined over 27,000 yuan for illegally profiting. After the verdict, the companies repeatedly requested a reduction because they had no money to pay, but this was not approved. The provincial government now ordered the money to be paid within three days, or they would be severely punished. However, even if the two companies compensated with all their assets, it would still be insufficient. Therefore, the two managers went to the county to request relief, hoping to get a reduction. However, the County Narcotics Suppression Section was executing the provincial order and had no authority to object. Currently, the two managers, Liao Ruting and Shen Yunxi, have been temporarily detained, and another report has been submitted to the province for instructions.</p>
<h3>Electricity Rates Further Reduced by Provincial Order</h3>
<p>The electricity plant here has been expanding significantly, extending west to Yangjian and east to Shaxi Town in Taicang. The electricity rates were 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for lighting. Users have been demanding reductions due to the high cost, and have repeatedly complained to the Provincial Construction Committee. The power plant, because it had a slight surplus last year, received approval from the provincial capital to reduce the rate by one cent per kilowatt-hour starting in July of this year, effectively charging 24 cents. However, the rate for electricity used by factories remained at 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, without reduction, causing opposition from factories and electricity users, who filed another complaint. After a detailed review of the power plant's business regulations by the Provincial Construction Committee, it was deemed necessary to reduce the rate further. An order has now been received by the county to reduce the electricity rate for lighting to 23 cents per kilowatt-hour and for electricity (1-100 kilowatt-hours) to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, to be implemented from the first day of next year. This should resolve the long-standing dispute between users and the power plant.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Salt Warehouse Accounts Unsealed</h3>
<p>Chu Longyin, an investigator from the Jiangsu Provincial Salt Inspectorate, came to Wuxi on the 9th of this month to secretly investigate a complaint. He first went to the Xichengjia Salt Public Warehouse to investigate and review the accounts. He was refused by the warehouse staff. The investigator Chu, together with county police officers, sealed the accounting room. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. After this incident, the Deputy Manager of the warehouse, Lu Xuan, immediately went to Shanghai to report to the head warehouse. The head warehouse then sent Dai Yiqun to Wuxi, who contacted the County Chamber of Commerce and then went to the County Government to see County Magistrate Long. County Magistrate Long ordered two political police officers to go to the warehouse and, together with Investigator Chu, unsealed the accounting room and inspected the accounts, a total of nine books. The flow accounts are the most important. They are still being inspected. It is reported that the content of the case is that Ling Xichao, the district chief of the Sixth District of the Five-County Salt Police in Wuxi and Suzhou, was recently accused of colluding with the Salt Public Warehouse to sell smuggled salt. Therefore, the Salt Inspectorate sent Investigator Chu to Wuxi to investigate thoroughly. The truth should come to light soon. Yesterday (14th) at [illegible time], Investigator Chu received a long-distance call from the Director of the Inspectorate, instructing Chu to return to the Inspectorate immediately to report and for other important business. Investigator Chu obeyed the order and returned to the province by car at around 3:00 PM. However, the case has not yet ended, so he will return to Wuxi in a day or two to investigate further for review.</p>
<h3>Yonglong Silk Factory Strike</h3>
<p>At the Yonglong Silk Factory in Huangbudun, outside the North Gate, there are a total of 320 silk reeling machines and about 500 workers. After the meal break the other day, the factory followed the usual practice of sounding the siren to call the female workers back to work. While some female workers returned to the factory as usual, the rest of the workers gathered outside the factory, unwilling to return to work, staging a strike. The small factory owner, Gao Yuanjun, and others tried to persuade the female workers to resume work. Unexpectedly, dozens of thugs shouted and threw bricks and stones outside the factory. Some of the factory's glass windows were broken, and the female workers inside were frightened and fled, causing great chaos. The thugs shouted to the female workers in the factory to stop working and gather outside. This was stopped by the factory staff, who apprehended two individuals, Wang A'er, a leather worker, and Xia Ruyi, a woman from Yancheng, and handed them over to the Fourth Public Security Bureau for investigation. However, Wang and Xia both denied inciting the strike. Yesterday morning (14th), all the female workers at the factory had returned to work and resumed their normal duties.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Murder Case: Coffin Opened for Examination</h3>
<p>Sun Xiaolong, a resident of Qiuxiang Lane Village, Shiqiao Town, in the Third District of Wu County, owns about seven or eight mu of land and also works as a leather worker. His mother, Madam Sun, and his wife, Madam Zhu, both work outside to make a living, so his family can be considered well-off in the village. On the 10th of this month, Madam Zhu suddenly received a report from a villager that Xiaolong had died suddenly from acute illness. She immediately rushed back, but the body had already been dressed for burial, and the coffin had been purchased by Luo Ruiyuan and others from the same village. Madam Zhu, overcome with grief, noticed that her husband's face was bruised after death, which aroused her suspicion. Soon after, she hastily completed the burial. The next day, after inquiring from her neighbors, she learned that Luo Husheng, Luo Ruiyuan, and Luo Yinsheng from the village went to Xiaolong to collect a monthly payment, but Xiaolong refused. They first argued and then beat him severely, causing his death. Upon hearing this, Madam Zhu reported to the Third Branch of the Xiahe Town Public Security Bureau on the 13th. Patrol Officer Deng Yuan, realizing that the case involved a murder, immediately reported it to the local court for investigation. The Prosecutor's Office dispatched personnel to the village on the 14th to open the coffin for examination. The murderer, Luo Husheng, has been arrested by the police from the Third Branch and will be handed over for processing after the examination of the body.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Five Bandits Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>At the end of last month, a large gang of bandits suddenly landed in Shanlian Town, which belongs to this county, and looted the entire town. Afterwards, the Wuxing District Security Headquarters, the 14th Security Battalion, and the Detective Brigade launched a search and arrested Chen Shenghong, Ruan Haiqing, Gu Jiacheng, Cao Jinbo, and Li Desheng. After repeated interrogations, they confessed to the robbery and were sentenced to death. It is reported that the five criminals were transported to the South Gate drill ground this morning (13th) and executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Two Organizations Held a Grand Tea Party Yesterday to Bid Farewell to Wang Jingqi, Envoy to Sweden and Norway, and to Welcome Those Returning from the United States and Siam; Each Presented Thought-Provoking Reports and Speeches</h3>
<p>The International Problems Research Society and the Catholic Advancement Association held a tea party at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 5 p.m. yesterday to bid farewell to Wang Jingqi, the newly appointed envoy to Sweden and Norway, and to welcome Chen Guangfu, Guo Chengwen, Gu Yiqun, representatives who had just returned from the United States after negotiating the Sino-American silver agreement, and Lin Kanghou and Wang Zhixin, members of the delegation to Siam. Chen, Guo, and Gu were summoned to Lushan by Finance Minister Kong and did not attend. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>The attendees of the tea party were all well-known figures. In addition to Wang Jingqi, Lin Kanghou, and Wang Zhixin, there were more than 50 people including Du Yuesheng, Zhao Jinqing, Zhou Jue, Li Zhaohuan, Liu Zhanen, Cheng Haifeng, Zhao Tiezhang, Zhao Shutong, Tang Wenkai, Xu Xinliu, Xu Xueyu, Xu Peihuang, Dong Xian Guang, and others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>First, Chairman Li Zhaoshi gave a speech, saying, "Today, the International Problems Research Society and the Catholic Advancement Association are here to bid farewell to Dr. Wang Jingqi, who is going to serve as the envoy to Sweden and Norway, and to welcome Mr. Chen Guangfu, Guo Bingwen, Gu Yiqun, Ling Bing, Lin Kanghou, and Wang Zhixin. Except for Mr. Chen, Guo, and Gu, who have not returned from Lushan, and Mr. Ling, who is in Beijing on official business and cannot attend, we hope that Dr. Wang and Mr. Lin and Wang, who are present today, will give us more guidance for discussion."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Speech</p>
<p>Then Mr. Wang stood up and gave a speech, saying, "Personally, I think diplomatic skills are like a roulette wheel. Although the small wheel advances, the big wheel does not move, making it difficult to achieve great results. Therefore, after I go abroad, I sincerely hope that my friends at home will give me guidance from time to time so that I can follow it." Mr. Wang also had a written speech entitled "Understanding Sweden and Norway." The summary first described the geographical situation of Sweden and Norway, the historical process of the two countries' separation and unity, and the economic and industrial situation, including a detailed description of Sweden's agriculture, industry, commerce, and forestry. In the final remarks on trade between China and Sweden, he said that trade between China and Sweden began in 1847. Swedish imports are divided into three categories: the first category includes paper, printing paper, parchment paper, glassine paper, parchment paper, oil-proof paper, imitation paper, gauze paper, writing paper, glazed paper, drawing paper, banknote paper, newsprint, cigarette paper, cardboard, kraft paperboard, wood pulp, glue, and matches, etc.; the second category includes lamps, lamp fixtures, enameled ironware, etc.; and the third category includes steel, screws, rivets, gas appliances, and alcohol-burning appliances and their accessories, electric motors and their accessories, insulated cables, engines and their accessories. China exports very few goods to Sweden, including carpets, antiques, tung oil, piece goods, pure antimony tungsten ore sand, and raw antimony, etc. He then described Norway's industry, commerce, agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing. Regarding trade between China and Norway, he said that trade between China and Norway began at the same time as trade between China and Sweden, i.e., 1847, which is almost a century ago. Norway's imports are mostly paper, including printing paper, parchment paper, glassine paper, (Slascine) parchment paper, oil-proof paper, imitation paper, gauze paper, writing paper, glazed paper, drawing paper, banknote paper, newsprint, cardboard, etc., as well as cod liver oil, biscuits, milk cream, and canned fish. China's exports to Norway include silk embroidery, floral items, blue clothing, miscellaneous grains, whole bamboo, seeds, white peas, tung oil, tea oil, duck feathers, and pig intestines. He also mentioned the treaty relations between Sweden, Norway, and China, saying that China has two treaty relations with the two countries, starting in the 27th year of the Qing Daoguang reign, when the "Thirty-Three Articles of the Sino-Swedish-Norwegian Five-Port Trade Regulations" were signed. At that time, Sweden and Norway were still in a federal era. Finally, he concluded as follows: "In general, if we examine the history of Sweden and Norway, observe their national power, and study their relationship with our country, the position of the two countries will be self-evident. However, in order to further enhance the friendly relations between China and Sweden and between China and Norway, we still have two things to do in the future: (1) Request Sweden and Norway to fulfill their promise to abolish consular jurisdiction in China as soon as possible in order to remove the stain on the international community and allow our country to achieve equal status; (2) Strive to promote commerce and achieve a balance of exports. For Sweden, we should strictly follow the provisions of Article 4 of the Sino-Swedish Commercial Treaty of 1909, 'Chinese people are allowed to travel to all parts of Sweden to transport goods and trade, and engage in industry and commerce in accordance with the current laws and regulations and the preferential treatment given to the people of the most favored nations.' We also hope to introduce our culture to the two Nordic countries as much as possible within the possible scope so that the friendship between the two major ethnic groups in China and the West can be further enhanced and the understanding can be further deepened."</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Then Lin Kanghou gave a speech, saying, "The delegation to Siam has been back in the country for a month. The situation of the inspection has been published in the newspapers. The purpose of the inspection to Siam can be summarized in eight words: to connect diplomatic relations and to comfort overseas Chinese. The inspection work is divided into two major parts: connecting diplomatic relations, which is of a diplomatic nature, is the responsibility of the head of the delegation, Ling (Bing). Because it involves diplomacy, it cannot be published before reporting to the government. The work of comforting overseas Chinese is the responsibility of my humble self, which is further divided into improving the education of overseas Chinese, investigating the economy, and promoting the sale of domestic goods. The economic investigation work is the responsibility of Mr. Wang Zhixin, including the status of the Siamese rice industry, the trends of the overseas Chinese agricultural and commercial economy, and economic matters. In terms of education, before the delegation went, many overseas Chinese schools were forced to teach Siamese and replace principals due to the Siamese government's promulgation of education regulations. Later, due to the opposition of the overseas Chinese, the government made some compromises. Therefore, after the delegation arrived, the number of overseas Chinese schools that have been restored as a result of frank talks with the Siamese Ministry of Education is not small. Promoting the sale of domestic goods is quite difficult due to the cheap dumping of Japanese goods. As a result, we generally hope that overseas Chinese can choose domestic goods that are beneficial to the country and promote them first. The population of Siam is more than 11 million, of which more than 3 million are overseas Chinese, and only more than 3 million are purely Siamese (i.e., natives). The rest are mixed Sino-Siamese blood. Therefore, the Siamese government also finds it difficult to solve this problem. Therefore, according to its national laws, all those born in Siam are Siamese. The delegation's itinerary went through the British, American, and French territories, and there were many feelings about the policies of the various countries' colonies. Remembering the difficulties of overseas Chinese in establishing themselves overseas, we hope that the country can help overseas Chinese survive. The prosperity of overseas Chinese will benefit the country a lot. I hope the whole country will no longer neglect them."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhixin's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Zhixin then gave a speech, saying, "Mr. Lin has described the process of the inspection to Siam in detail, so there is no need to repeat it. What I want to tell you is three points about the past, present, and future of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia for research. I have been to Southeast Asia four times, and this trip to Siam is my second time. According to my experience, the economic situation of overseas Chinese is getting worse and worse. When I first went to Southeast Asia, it was fifteen years ago, and the wealthy overseas Chinese merchants in various parts of Southeast Asia at that time have now mostly lost their businesses, and some are even destitute. According to the international situation and the cycle of the world economy, in another fifteen years, I am afraid that the situation of overseas Chinese overseas will be even worse than today. Therefore, it is very beneficial to the country to maintain the status of overseas Chinese and enable them to obtain their inherent economic power overseas. Otherwise, the loss of power of overseas Chinese overseas will have a great impact on the country. This is what I sincerely hope that the government and the people will not neglect."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Announces Amendments to Four Labor Regulations; Criminal Cases Should Be Sent to the Court for Handling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs: "In the case of the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 4656, it was found that the Municipal Government had previously reported that workers who are actually employed in factories on a continuous basis are often called temporary workers and are arbitrarily dismissed. Now, the Bureau of Social Affairs has drafted two measures to restrict this, and has attached the General Rules on Workers' Treatment in Shanghai and requested that they be reviewed and filed for record. After being submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and reply, it is now replied that the case of restricting factories from employing workers of a continuous nature as temporary workers in an attempt to be clever was previously reported by the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union, which stated that the Shanghai Shenxin No. 1 Textile Factory has recently employed workers and issued them with temporary work booklets. Even if they have worked in the factory for more than three months, they are still regarded as temporary workers and are arbitrarily dismissed, causing repeated disputes. Please explain whether the provisions of Articles 27 and 29 of the Factory Law can be applied. After being explained by the Ministry, it was found that the temporary work booklets issued by the factory did not specify a period of time. If the workers continue to work in the factory for more than three months, they can be handled in accordance with the Interpretation No. 1155 of the Judicial Yuan, such as oral contracts without a specified period of time, which should naturally be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 of the Factory Law. The notification was issued and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs was ordered to comply. Regarding the General Rules on Workers' Treatment in Shanghai, it was found that they are applicable to factories and stores outside the scope of the Factory Law. Even if there are some inconsistencies with the Factory Law, they can be tolerated as long as they are suitable for the local conditions. However, some of the articles in the General Rules are within the scope of criminal law. It is proposed to add a provision to refer them to the court for handling, and those whose meaning is unclear are proposed to be deleted. A list of the articles in the General Rules that are proposed to be deleted or amended is attached for review and approval. According to this, the review and approval are appropriate and should be handled accordingly. In addition to notifying the Ministry, a copy of the original attached list will be issued to the Municipal Government for compliance and amendment. This order, etc., includes a copy of the list. Having received this, in addition to amending and reissuing the four types of regulations, including the General Rules on Workers' Treatment in this city, in accordance with the instructions, a copy of the attachment will be issued to the Bureau for immediate compliance. This order, a total of one copy of the attachments is issued: (1) Article 8, Section 2 of the General Rules on Workers' Treatment in Shanghai, 'Those who deliberately frame others with evidence' is unclear in meaning and may be deleted; (2) Article 17, Section 4 of the General Rules on Workers' Service in Shanghai, involves criminal law and it is proposed to add 'and refer it to the court for handling' at the end of the text; Article 18, Sections 5, 6, 9, and 10 all involve criminal law and it is proposed to add a new item, 'In addition to dismissal, the above-mentioned Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 shall be referred to the court for handling;' (3) Article 12, Section 2 of the General Rules on the Treatment of Industrial and Commercial Shop Employees in Shanghai, 'Those who deliberately frame others with evidence' is unclear in meaning and may be deleted; (4) Article 13, Section 3 of the General Rules on the Service of Industrial and Commercial Shop Employees in Shanghai, involves criminal law and it is proposed to add 'and refer it to the court for handling' at the end of the text; Article 14, except for Sections 1, 5, 6, 9, and 10, all other sections involve criminal law and it is proposed to add a new item, 'In addition to dismissal, the above-mentioned Sections 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 shall be referred to the court for handling.'"</p>

<h3>Chen Bofan Discusses Nationwide Match Control: The Head Office and Three Branches Have Been Established; Total Capital Temporarily Set at 5 Million Yuan in Legal Tender; Operations Scheduled to Commence One Month Later</h3>
<p>Recently, China's match industry has implemented control measures, with investments from both Japan and the United States in cooperation. The outside world is unclear about the truth. A reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Chen Bofan, a prominent overseas Chinese merchant who initiated the control measures, at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club yesterday. According to Mr. Chen, matches are a necessity for human consumption, and their status is as important as public utilities such as transportation and electricity. The import of matches into China began during the Tongguang period of the late Qing Dynasty, while domestic manufacturing started around the fifteenth year of Guangxu. Looking back at the history of the match industry in China, it can be roughly divided into three periods. The first period, before the twenty-second year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, was the era of European match monopoly. The second period, from the twenty-second year of Guangxu to the seventh year of the Republic of China, was the era of Japanese match dumping. The third period, from the seventh year of the Republic of China to the twentieth year of the Republic of China, was a period when domestic matches were barely able to meet domestic demand. According to customs statistics, in the years before the twentieth year of the Republic of China, match imports exceeded exports by three million to nine million bales. From the twenty-first year onwards, due to the state's protection of domestic industries and increased tariffs, exports temporarily exceeded imports, which can be said to be the only prosperous period for China's match industry. Subsequently, due to the government's revision of unified taxes, the establishment of new factories in various places, and the lack of coordination among the same industry, overproduction occurred, and prices fell accordingly. The situation of decline was almost impossible to survive. However, in order to maintain operations, it was necessary to unite with each other to reverse the decline. Therefore, on the one hand, we requested government guidance, and on the other hand, the same industry tried to implement control measures and agree on production and sales. This started around February of last year, when Mr. Liu Hongsheng and I humbly sought the leaders of the national match industry to jointly initiate the establishment of a National Match Production and Sales Joint Venture to implement control measures in order to balance supply and demand and stabilize market prices. Since the preparation, it has taken one year and six months to date. Recently, the central government approved a total capital of 5 million yuan in national currency. More than 80 manufacturers have participated, and their distribution areas are the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, Hebei, Anhui, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hubei. Foreigners who have established factories in China to manufacture matches include Japan and the United States. At present, Japan has fully joined, and the United States is still in negotiations, which should be resolved soon. As for the method of capital contribution of the company, it is recognized according to the ratio of production volume. Domestic manufacturers account for 75% of the shares, and foreign manufacturers account for 25%. The directors and supervisors have also been selected, and senior executives have begun to serve. Three branches have been established in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao, and other provinces and cities plan to establish dozens of branches, which are currently being planned. Since August 1st, the head office has convened representatives from all parties to negotiate for days, which has not yet ended. Because the control business is still a pioneering initiative in China, various rules and operating methods must be carefully studied in the future to ensure excellent products, minimize profits as much as possible, and aim at the interests of the public. It is expected that official operations can begin in one month. Finally, Mr. Chen also mentioned that there are many other industries in China whose situation is the same as that of the match industry. Therefore, he hopes that all industries can implement their own control measures, and then the entire control can be achieved. It is also necessary for the same industry to cooperate, align steps, unite with each other, and work hard to move forward, and then they can deal with others. In order to seek the development of national capital, there is no other good policy besides control.</p>
<h3>Nanyang and North China Markets: Chinese Flour on the Rise, Low Cost Overwhelms Japanese Flour</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reported that in the past two months, Shanghai tin flour has sold well in Nanyang and North China, and the business has grown rapidly, creating a record since the European War. According to flour industry sources, the Nanyang Chinese flour market has been defeated by Japanese flour since the European War. The North China market has also been defeated by the Shanghai tin flour industry due to the special forces of the Japanese side since the September 18th Incident. In mid-last month, the wheat-producing areas of the United States and Australia suffered from drought, and wheat production was greatly affected. The price of foreign wheat soared. At this time, it was the time when China's new wheat was on the market, and the value of Chinese wheat was at the lowest position in the world. Comparing the price of foreign wheat markets with the value of Chinese wheat at the price of the 10th of this month, the price of Chinese wheat was 4.8 yuan per market dan, while the price of foreign wheat markets was (1) Liverpool wheat price was 7 shillings and 8 pence per 100 pounds, equivalent to 6.65 yuan in Chinese currency, and about 7 yuan per market dan in Chinese currency, (2) Chicago wheat price was 1.12 US dollars per bushel (weighing 60 pounds, 54 catties), equivalent to 3.26 yuan in Chinese currency, equivalent to 6.2 yuan in Chinese currency per market dan, (3) Canadian wheat is the same as Chicago wheat, (4) Japanese wheat market, 9.9 Japanese yen per 10 sima dan, equivalent to 9.7 yuan in Chinese currency, and the price of foreign wheat on the 10th of this month has been jumping around 2 yuan since the 5th, so the price of foreign wheat and Chinese wheat is quite different. Because the raw material price of Chinese flour is low and the cost is greatly reduced, the Japanese flour industry has been overwhelmed by us. Japan is a country that does not produce wheat, but it is a country that produces flour. Previously, it purchased wheat from Australia, Canada, Chicago, and other places to Japan, and after making flour, it dumped it to Nanyang and North China. After the price of foreign wheat was high, the cost of raw materials for Japanese flour increased sharply. The original price of shipping Liverpool wheat to Japan was 7 yuan per dan, plus 1 yuan for freight and 2.5 yuan for Japanese import tax, the price should be above 10 yuan. Therefore, the Japanese flour industry has suffered a miserable decline in the past two months. At the same time, the Chinese flour industry has risen. The Nanyang flour market occupied by Japan has been replaced by us, and the area where Japanese flour is dumped in North China has also been recovered by us. Therefore, our flour industry is eager for the government to prohibit the export of Chinese wheat to Japan, so that the price of domestic wheat can be increased, so that the flour industry and the rural areas can benefit from both, and the Japanese flour industry can be put in a desperate situation.</p>
<h3>Kapok is Mistakenly Prohibited from Exporting, Resolution After Petition</h3>
<p>The Kapok Industry Association of this city stated that the customs ordered the prohibition of the export of waste cotton, resulting in the same rejection of kapok, which has had an unprecedented impact on the industry. Representatives Xie Zhongle and Bao Guoliang were specially sent to Beijing to petition the central government. After arriving in Beijing, because all the dignitaries were in Lushan, they could not get any information. The representatives believed that the matter was serious and difficult to delay, so they immediately went to Guling to visit the authorities and presented the details in person. As a result, they were received by Minister Kong, who inquired about the facts and examined the samples of kapok and waste cotton, and then understood and promised to order the Customs Administration to order the customs to correct the error. Therefore, the mistaken prohibition of kapok from export will be resolved soon, and the representative Bao Guoti has already taken a plane back to Shanghai yesterday to report to the industry.</p>
<h3>Special Zone Citizen Training: Registration Today, Public Training Committee Issues Notice to Citizens</h3>
<p>The special zone citizen training organized by the Citizens' Federation of the First Special Zone of this city has been carried out since the establishment of the Public Training Committee. It is now known that registration will be held separately in the Tinhau Temple Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the branch offices in various districts from today (time: 9:00 am to 4:00 pm every day). The Public Training Committee also issued a notice to the citizens of the special zone to arouse the attention of all sectors of society. The notice to the citizens is recorded as follows: Fellow compatriots of our special zone, we are a weak country and a weak people, oppressed by the invading countries. Our territory is shrinking day by day, our sovereignty is being eroded day by day, and our international status is falling day by day. This is a sign of a weak country. According to the critique of anthropologists, the physical strength of the Chinese nation is declining due to the incompleteness of medical and health equipment and the difficulties of people's lives. In view of the complete failure of our country in this World Games, this is another sign of a weak people. There are three elements of a country's founding: first, sovereignty; second, territory; and third, people, especially people. Sovereignty and territory still depend on the maintenance of patriotic people, otherwise the people will be weak and the country will be weak, and sovereignty and territory will not be guaranteed in the end. Therefore, if we want to talk about saving the country and surviving today, we should first strengthen the people. What are the conditions for strengthening the people? That is, every citizen of a country must have a strong physique, a sense of patriotism, and a habit of observing discipline and obeying the group. The implementation of citizen training is aimed at achieving these conditions for strengthening the people. With strong people, we can expect a strong country. Under the pressure of strong neighbors, if our compatriots throughout the country still have a breath, they still have the ambition to strengthen themselves and the country, then actively participating in public training is the only way. In urban areas, the living habits are not as simple and simple as in rural areas, and the physique cannot be compared with that of rural compatriots. The living habits are even more casual and indulgent. Therefore, citizen training is especially urgent in urban areas. This association is a citizen group in the First Special Zone. In view of this, we have specially organized a Citizen Training Committee so that our compatriots in the Special Zone can have the opportunity to strengthen their physique and increase their public knowledge, so as to develop their personal careers and benefit the society and the country. After preparation, registration will start today. I hope that the compatriots in the Special Zone will actively participate and not delay.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Elects the Executive Yuan to Withdraw Tax Police Stationed in Daishan</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, saying: Jiang Junjian, President of the Executive Yuan, the Daishan tragedy is in urgent need of handling. Our association has telegraphed to report to you for verification and preside over the case. Recently, I heard that the salt affairs authorities are transferring warships and sending troops, and far away transferred the tax police from Huaibei to the south, and they are all over Daishan. The little people have been poisoned by this. As a result, the people dare not return to their businesses, and the fishermen dare not go to the ocean. The representatives of the salt and fishermen came to the association to state their cases, and Chen Zhonggao, the executive member of our association, also sent a letter to the same effect. He urgently telegraphed to your seat for verification and prompt approval of the tax police authorities, and must not take the opportunity to retaliate. The tax police team stationed in Daishan was withdrawn, and the issue of aftermath was sold to the Yinxian District Administrative Inspector Commissioner for careful handling, in order to appease the people and eliminate hidden dangers. I can't help but look forward to it.</p>

After investigation, the merchants in various counties purchase goods from Shanghai and other places for sale. If the original goods are returned for exchange due to inconsistent quality, it is a constant thing. In order to facilitate the investigation and facilitate the lotus transportation, the regulations are as follows: (1) When a merchant encounters a situation where it returns the goods to the place of original purchase for exchange, it should report to the industry association or the chamber of commerce to check the distribution license originally obtained by the merchant. If it is consistent, the association will issue a certificate. If the original distribution license has been submitted to the customs by the association, the association will check whether it is consistent with the original registration when the goods arrived and issue a certificate for shipment. (2) When the distributed goods are returned, the merchant should issue a letter to the industry association or the chamber of commerce at the distribution location requesting the issuance of a certificate. (3) The aforementioned certificate should be returned to the original issuing place at any time after it is used up. In addition to the distribution, we should also consult and request your examination and distribution for compliance, etc. As a result, we should order the bureau to immediately comply, etc. By order of the association, we should record the order for notification. We hope that your association will check and comply.</p>

<h3>A Huge Noise on Huanlong Road, Two Men Injured by Explosion, One Said It Was Caused by Chemical Experiment, One Said It Was a Poison-Making Agency</h3>
<p>At about 6:10 pm yesterday, a huge explosion suddenly occurred on the second floor of No. 505 Huanlong Road. The police officers who heard the explosion at the time ran up to the building to investigate. They saw smoke filling the room and a pungent smell of medicine. They immediately reported to the police station and sent detectives to investigate. They found two men injured in the room. They immediately notified the fire department and sent ambulances to take the injured to the hospital for treatment. One of the men died soon after due to serious injuries. He was said to be surnamed Jin, and the other was Zhang Asheng, who is still in the hospital. As for the cause of the explosion, it is said that it was caused by a chemical experiment. Another source said that it was a poison-making agency. When it was rented two weeks ago, two people who looked like students went to rent it. The investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>A Huge Robbery of Cigarettes, Captured Bandits Interrogated, Fugitive Bandits Strictly Pursued</h3>
<p>On June 27th of this year, Yongtaihe Tobacco Company dispatched a barge to transport more than 20 boxes of cigarettes, which were robbed by a gang of bandits holding guns on the river surface. The water police station's detective Cheng Yongnian and others arrested the bandits Sheng Dalang, Wang Genlang, and the receivers Shen Jialu, Da Zhangcai Lin, and Wu Jiasheng, and confiscated most of the stolen goods. After interrogation, it was found that the fugitive bandits included Bu Dailang, Xu Gu, Jin Hua, Wang Jinsheng, and others, as well as the fugitive receivers Zhang Mulin, Gu Chunzhong, Wang Douming, Pan Xukui, and others. In addition to the wanted list for the fugitive criminals, the arrested criminals were transferred to the local court, and prosecutor Xiao investigated and prosecuted them for robbery of stolen goods. Yesterday, judge Shan Wu opened the court for trial. The defendants all gave vague statements, shirking responsibility and refusing to admit it. The police station's detective Cheng Yongnian arrived to prove that all the defendants arrested in this case were the principal offenders. The Yongtaihe Company's secretary Cheng Renjie filed a case stating that a total of 32 boxes of cigarettes were robbed, worth 1,811 yuan. There were also seven large and small boxes of Huacheng and Zhonghe, so the total value was 6,059 yuan in national currency. In addition to recovering 4,154.59 yuan, there are still 2,429.18 yuan missing and lost. He requested a judgment to recover the money. At this point, the judge ruled that it was necessary to investigate the case, ordered the defendants to be detained after the trial.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Approaching, Now Coming from Hong Kong, Forecast for Heavy Thunderstorms</h3>
<p>Foreign News Agency: The recently occurred hurricane is still at latitude 21 degrees and longitude 114 degrees, blowing wildly to the northwest. If it continues in this direction, it will soon attack the Gulf of Guangzhou and blow into the southern coast of China from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Speaking of this city, the weather suddenly turned mild yesterday, which is also indirectly affected by this hurricane. The southeast wind that came yesterday was actually moistened by the humidity at the northern end of the hurricane.</p>
<p>According to the observation of Xujiahui Observatory, this humidity can cause heavy thunderstorms in Shanghai and its surrounding areas.</p>
<h3>Ban on Extra Tips, Scheduled to Take Effect on September 15</h3>
<p>The ban on extra tips in this city has been discussed and decided by the New Life Movement Promotion Association, which convened relevant agencies and groups. The second meeting was held at the Municipal Party Headquarters conference room at 10 am yesterday. Zhou Guoping from the Municipal Government, Jiang Hao from the New Life Movement, Feng Erying from the Public Security Bureau, Yuan Hongjun from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xie Renyue from the Social Affairs Bureau, Li Mancun and Hu Yuantang from the Wine and Restaurant Industry Association, Zhu Tiwu from the Travel Industry Union, and others attended. Chairman Jiang Hao and recorder Zhu Jiarang began the discussion after performing the formalities. The draft implementation plan was passed, and it was decided that the association would print and distribute the draft plan to various trade unions and labor unions for research and limit the submission of research results within a week. After reporting to the association, the association will revise it after synthesizing the opinions of all parties and convene another meeting to pass the implementation. The draft implementation plan is recorded as follows: (1) The ban on extra tips will take effect on September 15. (2) All workers in various industries should determine their wages. The standards will be discussed by the association and then agreed upon by both labor and management in each industry and reported to the municipal government for record before the end of August. If they are not reported on time, the municipal government will set them on their behalf before September 5. (3) All extra tips belong to the workers. (4) Huge amounts of security deposits should not be charged and should be replaced with shop security. All previous receipts should be exchanged or deposited in a reliable bank to pay interest according to the regulations. (5) In the future, workers are absolutely not allowed to solicit tips from customers. If found, customers or onlookers can report to the police and military authorities or the New Life Movement for appropriate punishment. (6) In the future, customers must not tip, and all civil servants in the city should absolutely abide by it. If anyone is found to be violating the regulations, their service agencies should impose appropriate fines or other punishments. (7) In the future, if customers still voluntarily tip after the workers politely refuse, the workers should hand over the money to the accounting room for transfer to aviation donations. If the capital side or employees embezzle the money, they will be severely punished once discovered. (8) This method will be implemented by the municipal government. (9) The special zone will be implemented by the municipal government in consultation with the Bureau of Works, and the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be requested to assist in the process. (10) After the implementation of this method, the capital side must not raise prices.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Continues to Recruit Female Police Officers, Registration Today, Examination on the 24th</h3>
<p>The municipal public security authorities, in order to rectify police affairs and facilitate work, entrusted the police training institute to publish an advertisement to recruit 40 female police officers. The examination has been announced, and 25 candidates who passed the examination, such as Wang Fuci and Song Qimei, will first enter the institute for training on the 18th. It is now known that the physical condition of the previous candidates was too poor, so the quota has not been filled, so 15 female police officers will be recruited. Registration will begin today and will end on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Physical examinations will be conducted on the morning of the 22nd, and written and oral examinations will be held on the morning of the 24th. The registration and examination location is still at the Police Training Institute on Longhua Road, Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Impersonating for Medicine Sales: Fraud Case Concluded, Sentencing Set for the 18th</h3>
<p>A rogue from Yuyao, Hu Hengxiang, on the 2nd of this month, impersonated Wang Xiaolai, former chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. He carried twenty boxes (eight hundred bottles in total) of Jizhong Duoming water from the Guizhou Pharmacy to No. 26, Lane 799, Haig Road in the French Concession, the residence of Liu Wendao, our country's ambassador to Italy, attempting to sell them for twenty yuan. Prior to this, he had falsely called Liu's residence under Wang's name to notify them. Liu's residence reported this to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Hu and bring him to the Second Special Court. The police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution against him for fraud. After initial hearings, the case was adjourned for further investigation and questioning, as reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huan of the Eighth Criminal Court continued the trial. The defendant, Hu Hengxiang, maintained that he met a familiar but unnamed person while sipping tea at the First Spring Tea House on Avenue Edward VII, who entrusted him to deliver the "sha" medicine water to Liu's residence, hoping to earn a dollar or two for the delivery and that he did not dare to commit fraud himself. Subsequently, Detective Yang Wende, who was handling the case, reported that during the adjournment, he investigated with the Guizhou Pharmacy and confirmed that the "sha" medicine water was genuine, with a wholesale price of fifty cents per box. The defendant was indeed found to have engaged in fraudulent sales by impersonation. The court verified the testimonies, declared the debate concluded, and scheduled sentencing for the 18th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Bund Park Visitor Numbers Last Month Break All Previous Records</h3>
<p>The parks group of the Public Works Department (工部局), through Bian Qian, reported that the total number of visitors to all parks in the past month (July) reached over 700,000. The Bund Park alone saw 323,792 visitors in a single month, exceeding the same month two years ago by over 15,000. The July of two years ago was previously the record for total visitor numbers in any past July; that record has now been broken. Regarding the climate, the highest temperature last month was 97.7 degrees, the lowest was 69 degrees, the average high temperature was 88.1 degrees, the average low temperature was 76.7 degrees, and the rainfall was 6.89 (units not specified). Furthermore, the sports fields in the parks were very popular, with Hongkou Park being the most active, hosting over 7,500 participants in various sports. Additionally, the Japanese baseball team came to Shanghai last month and competed at Hongkou Park, attracting large crowds. On July 26th alone, the audience reached as many as 3,700 people.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between British and Japanese Nationals: Police Defend Their Respective Citizens, as Reported by Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>The "Gai Ron Sha" (外論社) news agency reports: On the evening of the 12th, in front of a Japanese store at the corner of Wenlu and Zha Pu roads, a group of Japanese were listening to a wireless broadcast of the Olympic swimming competition when someone in Room 404 of the nearby Biers Apartments suddenly threw down dirty objects such as bread crumbs from the window. A Japanese police officer among the Japanese immediately entered the apartment building and rang the doorbell for five minutes. However, the lights in the room were already off, and no one came out. The Japanese police officer believed that, from the standpoint of maintaining order, he could not ignore the situation. However, a certain British officer said, "Since they are already asleep, there is no need to bother them" and did not investigate further. It is reported that Room 404 is apparently occupied by a detective chief inspector of the Public Works Department. The Japanese side claims that if the Public Works Department does not take appropriate action on this matter, the issue may escalate.</p>
<p>Another report: At 9:30 PM on the 13th, a sailor from the Japanese Special Naval Landing Force was resting on a bridge in the Zha Pu Road Children's Park when a British person suddenly approached and made insulting remarks to the Japanese sailor, thus causing a dispute. The Hongkou station of the Public Works Department police arrested the British person and interrogated him. The person admitted the aforementioned remarks. The Zha Pu Road branch of the Naval Landing Force immediately reported this matter to its headquarters, according to the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun (上海每日新聞).</p>
<h3>Triangular Love Affair: Difficult Choice Leads Dance Hostess to Attempt Suicide, Discovered and Hospitalized</h3>
<p>Shen Xuemei, a 23-year-old woman from Nanxun, residing at No. 19, Lane 799, Daqing Lane, Lloyd Road, Nanjing Road, worked as a dance hostess at the Yangtze Dance Hall and the Vienna Garden. She had an inseparable relationship with Jiang Pinghua, a native of Wuxi and the young owner of the Gui Xiang Zhai sesame oil shop at No. 300 Jiujiang Road, what is commonly called a "trailing car" (拖車, meaning sugar daddy). However, in addition to Jiang, Shen also had a young man named Tang, with whom she was deeply in love. Recently, Shen and Jiang's secret was discovered by Tang, who became extremely jealous. In a moment of desperation, Tang urged Shen to marry him. But Shen was attached to Jiang's wealth and reluctant to let go, leaving her in a difficult position. As Tang continued to press her, Shen, unable to cope, ingested poison in an attempt to end her life. Fortunately, Jiang happened to be nearby and rushed her to the hospital, where she was revived. How this love triangle drama will end is yet unknown.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise from Cohabitation with a Prostitute: Finally Meet in Court, Prostitute Returns Home and Never Returns: Han Yichen Sues Prostitute's Father for Extortion</h3>
<p>Han Yichen, a local resident, currently 28 years old, works as a surveyor in a certain bureau. With a fondness for dalliances, he met Yang Meizhen, a prostitute from the Mei Fang brothel in Xinhui Le Lane on Sima Road, in June of the previous year. Yang, only sixteen, was from Ningbo. She fell in love with Han at first sight, and their feelings grew stronger each day, eventually leading to intimacy and pregnancy. Han felt it was not a long-term solution for Yang to remain in a brothel, so he discussed the matter with Yang Afu, the woman's father, wanting to marry her and bring her home. Afu had no objections. On March 25th of the previous year, Han paid a bride price of 800 yuan, for which Yang Afu provided a receipt, stating:</p>
<p>Received Tea Money</p>
<p>800 yuan. On the same day, he personally escorted his daughter Meizhen to Han's home. Afu was responsible for all of Meizhen's redemption procedures at the Mei Fang brothel. Han Yichen and Yang Meizhen then began cohabitating at No. 37, Lane 100, Baker Road, while Yang Afu lived at No. 25 in the same lane. Unexpectedly, on May 27th of this year, Yang Afu suddenly invited Yang Fusheng (i.e., Yang Baohong), a Qingpu native residing at No. 25, Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, to demand hundreds of French francs from Han Yichen. After negotiations, Han agreed to give 300 yuan as</p>
<p>Eternal Severance</p>
<p>fee, stipulating that Yang Afu would no longer have any disputes with Han. He paid 150 yuan upfront, with the remaining half to be paid in installments, and a written agreement was made. Han, in order to avoid further disputes, moved with Yang Meizhen to Pudong. However, on the 15th of last month, a man named San Guan came to Pudong and told Han that Yang's mother was seriously ill and needed her daughter to return home to care for her. Han, not knowing the truth, allowed Meizhen to go with the man. For over twenty days since then, Meizhen has not returned. On the previous day, Han</p>
<p>Crossed the River to Shanghai</p>
<p>to inquire about Meizhen's whereabouts at the Yang family's residence. Not only did Yang Afu refuse to hand over his daughter, but he conspired with Yang Fusheng to demand 4,000 yuan from Han. Han reported this to the Xinzha police station, which dispatched Detective Ma Derong to arrest both Yangs and detain them at the station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where the police department's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, charged them with attempted extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the criminal code. He also presented the case. Han Yichen then testified to everything, while Yang Meizhen claimed, "I met Han at the brothel, and</p>
<p>After Becoming Intimate</p>
<p>we began cohabitating. He kept delaying the wedding ceremony. Recently, Han wanted to take me to another city, so I returned to my mother's home. I did not try to defraud him of any money." When questioned, the two defendants denied demanding 4,000 yuan. Their lawyer stated in court that Yang Meizhen was seduced by Han, who falsely claimed to have no wife and even signed an agreement stating that they must get married; otherwise, he would pay a compensation of 10,000 yuan. Han's claims were all fraudulent, not only has he not</p>
<p>Held a Wedding</p>
<p>but he already has a wife at home. Furthermore, the 100 yuan living expense check he gave bounced. Han cannot even take care of himself, so how could he be defrauded of 4,000 yuan?" They then presented various pieces of evidence. Judge Huang Risheng, after reviewing the testimonies, acquitted Yang Afu and Yang Fusheng. They were released on bail to their defense lawyer pending appeal, with the obligation to appear when summoned.</p>
<h3>Petroleum Industry Meeting Opposes Forcible Donation for Petroleum Licenses: New Donation Category by the French Municipal Council, Decision to Request Negotiation by the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Petroleum Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, attended by managers from (Mobil), (Asiatic Petroleum), (Texaco), (Guanghua Petroleum), and 16 other companies including Baochang, Yuxing, Meikang, and Xiexingxiang. Chairman Chai Linsheng presided over the meeting. (1) The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, which was due to letters from clients like Shenghetai in the French Concession, stating that the French Municipal Council had recently sent personnel to forcibly collect donations for petroleum licenses and to demand a 10-yuan investigation fee. Yang Keqin, a representative from Shenghetai, presented the details of the forced donation and examined the French Municipal Council's gazette and tax schedule, finding no petroleum donation listed. There was only a "liquid fuel warehouse permit fee." If this donation is identified as such, and our industry shops are all considered warehouses, then it is clear that the French Municipal Council is mistaken. Because the sale of petroleum is closely related to the interests of your association, and now we are suffering unreasonable oppression from the French authorities, we request that your association, standing on the same ground, make reasoned arguments. The chairman confirmed that everything the representative said was true and, after consulting the tax regulations published in the French Municipal Council's gazette, found no provision for collecting petroleum donations. Our association should provide assistance. The proposed resolution was: Send a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce requesting that it forward a letter to the French Municipal Council demanding the immediate cancellation of the petroleum donation to relieve the merchants' plight. The meeting adjourned after the resolution was passed.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Bank Prepares to Resume Business: Yesterday's Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders Elects Yuan Duanfu and Others as Directors</h3>
<p>Since preparations for the resumption of business began at Ningbo Industrial Bank, everything is now ready. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders was convened on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road. 170 shareholders attended the meeting, including Yuan Duanfu, Cao Shuliu, Zou Shengsan, Wu Zhihao, and Chen Jian, representing 2,732 shares. Chairman Wu Zhihao reported on the progress of the preparations for the resumption of business, followed by accountant Xu Yongzuo's report on the income and expenditure accounts of both the liquidation office and the resumption committee during the suspension period. (Omitted) Subsequently, the meeting discussed matters such as the date of resumption. Finally, directors and supervisors were re-elected. The election was completed at around 4:00 PM, followed by refreshments, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Zhihao reported on the progress of the preparations for resuming business, saying: Since the bank was established, it encountered the January 28th Incident, and its business failed to achieve its expected development. I (Zhihao) have been managing it with the kind support of the shareholders, and I have been exhausted for three years, hoping that the market would improve and turn danger into safety, living up to the trust of the shareholders. Unexpectedly, the global recession spread, and Shanghai was affected, resulting in unprecedented changes in the financial industry. Bankruptcies of money houses and banks were frequently heard. With the bank's weak capital, how could it withstand the impact of this crisis? Unable to reverse the situation, the board of directors had no choice but to decide to temporarily suspend withdrawals on June 4th, 1935. This is something that I regret, and I should express my apologies to the shareholders. After the bank temporarily suspended withdrawals, the Ningbo compatriots in Shanghai felt that the reputation of Ningbo people was being damaged and advocated for the resumption of business. The bank's depositors also understood the bank's difficulties and expressed their support, formulating a plan for resumption. Chairman Chiang also sent three telegrams, promising to find a way to complete the resumption. A Resumption Movement Association of the bank was established at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, and a debt and creditor committee was signed in order to create a settlement. In accordance with the resumption plan, 50% of the deposits was converted into shares and 30% was converted into a two-year fixed deposit. 20% was repaid in cash. On the one hand, a liquidation office was established to reorganize the deposit and withdrawal accounts. Since the implementation, it has been smooth. Afterwards, the Resumption Movement Association was changed to the Resumption Preparatory Office to make further efforts. On November 5th, 1935, the office began to verify and issue deposits to depositors in accordance with the resumption plan, with officials from the Ministry of Finance supervising. However, due to the large number of depositors and the complicated procedures, it took a longer time. By the end of July of this year, the net amount of external debt for the savings department was 733,497.27 yuan, of which 701,688.15 yuan had been repaid, mortgaged, or transferred, leaving a balance of 31,809.12 yuan. The net amount for the commercial department was 344,072.83 yuan (excluding Ningbo Shenjiamen). Currently, the outstanding amount for repayment is 68,492.50 yuan. As for the outstanding amounts for savings and commercial departments, it is now stipulated that the outstanding amount will be deposited into the Dalai Bank at a ratio of 20% to avoid any future ambiguity. From this point of view, the bank's deposits can be said to be completely cleared, which is gratifying. However, the timing of the resumption of business and the operating policy after the resumption remain to be decided by the shareholders. On the occasion of this extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, I hereby report the progress of the preparations for the resumption as above.</p>
<p>Resolutions: The following resolutions were passed at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting of shareholders: (A) Regarding the determination of the date of resumption of business of the bank, it was resolved to entrust the board of directors to handle it. (B) Regarding the amendment of the articles of association, it was resolved to amend them as proposed. (C) Regarding the determination of the operating policy, it was resolved to save expenses and specialize in the fishing industry.</p>
<p>Re-election of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>After the ballot count, the elected directors were Yuan Duanfu, Chen Cuifu, Wu Zhihao, Chen Jian, Cao Shuliu, Zhuang Songfu, and Xie Shichang. The elected supervisors were Zou Shengsan and Wang Xiangqing.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Xujiahui Road: Thief Wounded and Apprehended</h3>
<p>At the residence of Gu Jiaxing at No. 21, Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, at 3:30 AM yesterday, four robbers wearing short clothes and speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly arrived. They were armed with two pistols. One robber stood guard outside the door, while the other three rushed inside, barging directly into the bedroom. At that time, the homeowner and his family were sound asleep. Upon realizing that robbers had entered the house, they threatened them with guns, and everyone was afraid to make a sound, allowing the robbers to ransack the cabinets and steal clothing and other items worth 120 yuan. The robbers fled the scene with the loot, scattering in different directions. One robber fled to Avenue Petain, where he was spotted by Chinese Constable Shun Xian, No. 376 of the French Police. The constable found the man's behavior suspicious and ordered him to stop for a search. The robber not only refused to comply but also opened fire on the constable. The constable returned fire, and the two sides exchanged five or six shots. As a result, the robber was hit by two bullets, one in the leg and one in the buttocks, and collapsed in front of No. 137, Avenue Petain. The constable immediately apprehended him and confiscated a loaded pistol from his person. He was taken to the police chief for interrogation. The robber confessed his name as Zhang Xiaoerzi, a native of Jiangbei. The police chief ordered him to be sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. Simultaneously, he ordered all detectives on duty to investigate and arrest the remaining robbers and bring them to justice. He also dispatched Detective Zuo Qihong to investigate the robbery at the homeowner's residence and sent the arrest report to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, requesting a postponement of the trial until the robber recovered from his injuries and the investigation was completed.</p>
<h3>Factory Association and Others Jointly Organize Autumn National Products Exhibition: Site Selected West of Penglai Market, Grand Opening Scheduled for September 1st</h3>

<p>Discussion of Organization</p>
<p>The Manufacturers' Association has repeatedly planned to hold a national products exhibition to promote the development of the national products industry in Shanghai. However, due to the lack of a suitable location, it has been delayed. Now, with the support of the Shanghai South City National Products Promotion Society, the Penglai Market has been deemed the most suitable venue for the exhibition. Representatives have been repeatedly sent to contact Mr. Kuang Zhongmou of the market. However, because houses are about to be built on the vacant land, Mr. Kuang was unable to agree. Later, with the enthusiasm for promoting national products from Ms. Xu Xiujin, a sincere request was made and Mr. Kuang finally agreed. In addition to submitting the application to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping, the association is soliciting participation from manufacturers to join in the event.</p>
<p>Grand Opening on September 1st</p>
<p>The association's notice soliciting participation from manufacturers was mailed yesterday and will hire market committee members to be responsible for all matters. Construction of the exhibition venue will begin soon, with site allocation on the 25th. The grand opening is scheduled for September 1st. The association also plans to add an amusement park, offering complimentary tickets to enhance the interest of visitors. The weather will be cool in late summer and early autumn. Once the opening occurs, it will surely stimulate public engagement.</p>

<h3>222 Route Ghisi  Xue Jiasheng, Kidnapped for Thirteen Days, Escapes on His Own Last Night  Appearing Distraught, Walks Barefoot on the Road  Chinese Police Find Him and Stop a Car to Escort Him  Chengdu Road Police Station Notifies the French Police Station  —Treatment in the Bandit's Den Considered Favorable—</h3>
<p>Xue Jiasheng, son of the late Jiangyin paint magnate Xue Baorun, was kidnapped on the afternoon of the 1st of this month at 5:25 PM at No. 5, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Afterwards, his family reported the incident to the police station, requesting an investigation. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. A full ten days have passed with no news, but unexpectedly, Xue suddenly escaped from the bandit's den at 6:05 PM yesterday. The detailed circumstances are reported below:</p>
<p>Current Situation of Xue Jiasheng</p>
<p>Xue Jiasheng is 34 years old, the third son of Xue Baorun, hence known as Xue Lao San. His eldest brother, Taosheng, is deceased. His other brothers are Yansheng and Gansheng. Jiasheng is married to the daughter of Zhou Weishi, a wealthy Suzhou merchant residing in Shanghai, and has two concubines. They reside separately in the temple lane of Jing'an Temple Road and No. 5, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre, the location of the recent kidnapping. In recent years, Jiasheng has been involved in repeated lawsuits over property disputes, and his family fortune is no longer what it once was. He was previously kidnapped while residing on Route Massenet two years ago, so this second kidnapping was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Second Kidnapping and Car Ride</p>
<p>Jiasheng usually kept a car with Concession license plate No. 2051 and employed a Russian bodyguard. He had dinner at his second concubine's residence every day. On the day of the kidnapping, Jiasheng drove his car to his second concubine's residence around 5 PM. Just as he was lying down for a nap, five or six bandits, dressed in short shirts and speaking local and northern accents, claimed to be visiting Ding Yitang, Jiasheng's embroiderer, and tricked their way into the front door. Three bandits then rushed upstairs with box cannons, forced Jiasheng into a black-plated car with a fake license plate No. 6974, which was waiting in the lane, and sped off towards Rue Say Zoong. Afterwards, his family was extremely anxious and helpless, so they reported to the relevant police station, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Escaping Barefoot Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>After Jiasheng was kidnapped on the afternoon of August 1st, a total of thirteen days passed. His family never received any information from the bandits, so they were extremely worried. Unexpectedly, at 6:05 PM yesterday afternoon, a Chinese police officer No. 1044 from the Chengdu Road Police Station in the Public Concession was on duty at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Avenue Foch. He saw a person with dirty clothes walking barefoot on the road, appearing distraught, fleeing from Rue Bédou in the French Concession towards the intersection of Avenue Foch and Chengdu Road. The officer found his appearance suspicious and ordered him to stop and questioned him. The person claimed to be Xue Jiasheng, the kidnapped victim, who had just escaped from the bandit's den and requested to be taken to the police station immediately for his safety.</p>
<p>Chinese Police Stop a Car for Transport</p>
<p>Knowing that he was the escaped victim, and realizing the importance of the matter, the Chinese police officer saw a private empty car with Concession license plate No. 8777 belonging to the Chen residence pass by. The officer immediately stopped the car, had Xue Jiasheng get in, and transported him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After some comforting to calm him down, detectives Feng Baishun and Wang Xichang questioned him. According to his memory, the bandit's den was located on Route Ghisi in the French Concession, but he could not remember the house number. The bandits were heavily guarded every day, with four armed bandits taking turns on watch. It was only yesterday afternoon that he managed to seize an opportunity to escape. The Chengdu Road Police Station, considering that the incident occurred in the French Concession, notified the French Concession's Rue Louvain Police Station by telephone, instructing them to take him into custody.</p>
<p>Detectives Search the Bandit's Den</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the Rue Louvain Police Station dispatched more than forty armed Chinese and Western detectives in five cars to the Chengdu Road Police Station. They took the victim, Xue Jiasheng, back to the French Police Station, questioned him in detail, and had Xue briefly describe the appearance of the bandits. They then ordered Xue to assist in leading the arrest. Unexpectedly, the bandit's den was located at 222 Route Ghisi. When the detectives got out of the cars in front of No. 210 Route Ghisi, intending to surround the house and make an arrest, they were spotted by the bandits on lookout at the windows along the street, and they all escaped from the balcony. Only two Mauser pistols, two cartridge clips, and thirty bullets were found in the house and taken back to the police station for storage. Xue Jiasheng was also escorted back to his residence by detectives dispatched by the police station.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Jointly Operate a Phosphate Fertilizer Factory  Drafting an Outline, Opening Next Year</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government's self-operated mixed fertilizer factory, represented by the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, has appointed Manager Lü Zhigang. The factory is located at the Mei'an Company warehouse at the Land Road Pier in Yangshupu. The mixing process is overseen by personnel dispatched by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction. Production began at the beginning of last month, and sales have started, but the volume is small. Next year, machinery will be purchased to replace manual mixing, which will speed up production. As for the phosphate fertilizer factory jointly operated by Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Departments of Construction and the investing China Agricultural and Industrial Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank are in contact separately. A draft organizational outline has been prepared, but no concrete decisions have been made for formal implementation. It will have to wait until next year. The factory site is planned to be located in Ningbo. Phosphate fertilizer raw materials are produced in Haizhou, northern Jiangsu, but whether the reserves are sufficient remains to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Bottle Industry's Self-Supervision Anti-Smuggling Measures  Resolution Passed and Implemented Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hot Water Bottle Industry Association, in view of the rampant smuggling in North China, hot water bottles being a major product of a certain country, with past sales to China amounting to a substantial sum of over a million dollars annually, and with Chinese manufacturers recently starting operations, recovering a significant portion of the market share, is concerned that smuggling may take advantage of the situation to evade taxes and dump products. Therefore, a general membership meeting was specially convened, deciding to proactively initiate self-supervision, organize an anti-smuggling committee, and elect Gan Dounan, Xu Wenfu, Zhang Qingfa, Chen Ji, and four others as committee members, responsible for reporting smuggled goods, and formulate a method for transporting and selling domestic hot water bottles to prevent smuggled goods from being mixed in and counterfeited. Before any hot water bottles are shipped, the trademarks and types of the goods must be reported to the association for verification and certification before shipment. Otherwise, they will be inspected and detained until cleared. The measures have been resolved and passed, and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Convenience of Sending Social Telegrams in This City</h3>

<h3>New Traffic Regulations in the Public Concession  Implementation Difficult to Postpone  Shanghai Municipal Council Responds to the Automobile Association  Restrictions on Vehicle Parking to Be Implemented as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's amendment to the traffic regulations, restricting roadside parking to alleviate street congestion, the Chinese Automobile Association, concerned about the increased restrictions on car parking thereafter, submitted a protest to the Municipal Council. Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Mr. P. F. Félipe, responded to the association yesterday, stating the reasons why the implementation of the amended traffic regulations could not be delayed. He stated that the amendment to the traffic regulations initially arose from a suggestion by the Municipal Council's Traffic Committee in mid-March last year. The amended regulations were disclosed in Chinese and foreign newspapers after being passed by the Board of Directors and were to be implemented at any time after nine months, with a sixty-day notice. After the disclosure of these new regulations, the impression was positive, and no one proposed opposition. In May of this year, the Commissioner of Police, based on the experience gained from investigations abroad during his long vacation, submitted a second report, stating that the amendment of the traffic regulations could not be delayed any longer. At that time, the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Police Committee, adopted the Commissioner of Police's opinion and issued a notice in mid-June, stipulating that the amended traffic regulations should be implemented three months later. On September 5th of this year, the new regulations will take effect. It can be seen that before and after the publication of the new traffic regulations, the municipal authorities carefully considered the interests of all parties and gave a very long period of deliberation. Therefore, although the Chinese Automobile Association raised objections in mid-July, the authorities carefully considered the results and there was no sufficient reason to allow the Municipal Council to delay the implementation of the new regulations that had already been announced. As for the association's claim that some cars will lose their parking places after the implementation of the new regulations, although the number estimated by the association slightly differs from that investigated by the police authorities, according to the on-site inspection of the police authorities, there are sufficient parking spaces in the central area to accommodate these vehicles with room to spare. Furthermore, the Municipal Council's administrative policy is that after a new problem arises, whether from experience, observation, or implementation effectiveness, there is always the possibility of re-examining it at any time. Therefore, after the implementation of these new regulations for a certain period of time, any amendments can be made from the lessons learned from experience. The two notices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice 1</p>
<p>Notice No. 4714 (Regarding the Amendment of Traffic Rules): It is hereby notified that Articles 1, 28, 47, and 48 of the Traffic Rules have been approved for amendment. The amendment to Article 1 is to delete the definitions of "straight parking vehicles" and "horizontal parking vehicles" and replace them with the following two definitions: Long-term parking: parking a vehicle on the street for a considerable period of time. Short-term parking: parking a vehicle on the street outside of designated parking areas, with a time limit. Article 28 is amended as follows: Article 28: Drivers shall not temporarily park vehicles or remain in any location on the street (except when complying with signals given by on-duty police officers) (A) Where "No Parking" signs are erected, or the roadside stone is painted red, or paved with black and white tiles (B) Parallel to tram stops (C) Within 30 feet of the corner of any major thoroughfare intersection (D) Between the traffic island and the roadside stone. Article 47 is amended as follows: Article 47: Vehicles shall not be "long-term parked" on the street except in designated areas, but "short-term parking" is permitted within a reasonable range and for a reasonable period of time. Areas designated for "long-term parking" of vehicles are divided into two categories: (1) in the middle of the street and (2) on the side of the street. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Areas Designated for (Long-Term) Parking of Cars (1) In the Middle of the Street</p>
<h3>Directors of Hua An Bank Charged with Embezzlement Case Concluded  Xie Yunbo Testifies on the Truth of Purchasing Treasury Bonds  Final Arguments Concluded Yesterday, Verdict to Be Announced on Wednesday</h3>
<p>The case of Fang Su'an, a shareholder and director of Hua An Bank at No. 73 Ningbo Road, and Ye Jingliang, the manager, being accused of embezzlement and breach of trust, has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Special Court One Judge Feng Shide continued the trial in Criminal Court One. Fang and Ye jointly retained lawyers Wu Linkun, Jiang Baoli, and Li Zuyu for defense. Lawyer Wang Yaotang, representing the police, stated, "The ¥7,000 loss on the twelve-year customs duty treasury bonds, as stated by the lawyer last time, was discovered to be an error after investigation. In June of last year, the market price of those treasury bonds did not fall to ¥14 or ¥15 per ¥100 bond. Therefore, the ¥7,000 figure is clearly incorrect. The ¥500 loss mentioned by the defendant Ye Jingliang is more likely to be accurate and should be corrected. Furthermore, Xie Yunbo, who handled the purchase and sale of the treasury bonds, has also arrived in court today and should be summoned to testify." The court then questioned Ye Jingliang about the course of events. According to Ye, on June 10th of last year, Fang Su'an instructed bank employee Xie Yunbo to purchase ¥50,000 of twenty-two-year customs duty treasury bonds. Xie purchased them from the Zhongyi Trust Company at a market price of ¥54.45. However, Fang suddenly claimed that Xie did not follow his price limit and denied the transaction, leading to a dispute. However, for the sake of the bank's reputation, Ye signed the transaction order on Fang's behalf. Afterwards, Fang firmly refused to acknowledge the transaction. Because of the internal credit relationship and because these treasury bonds had a better interest rate, they could only be returned to the bank. At the same time, ¥50,000 of unified tax treasury bonds with a slightly lower interest rate were sold off and used to cover the inventory. Therefore, the bank did not suffer any losses. Later, when the shareholders raised questions, they insisted that Ye negotiate compensation from Fang. Ye was unable to ask Fang, so after the shareholders meeting in April of this year, Ye cleared the debts and considered the matter settled. Therefore, this time there was no involvement with the bank. Fang Su'an stated that when he instructed Xie to purchase the bonds, he set a limit of ¥54.23, but Xie actually bought them at ¥54.45. Although the difference was only ¥0.15 per ¥100, he refused to acknowledge the transaction. Therefore, it was transferred into the bank's account, but there was no loss. Xie Yunbo then testified that a dispute did occur over the price limit at that time. The defendant's lawyers Wu Linkun and others then presented the fact that Ye Jingliang had sold all of the bank's public bonds last year, making a profit of more than ¥100,000, and asked Fang if this was true. The court then asked Fang, who confirmed that it was true. After the court questioned the two defendants in detail, it ordered the commencement of arguments. After arguments between police lawyer Wang and the defendant's lawyers, Judge Feng declared the proceedings concluded and scheduled the verdict for next Wednesday.</p>

All dance halls in the city have scheduled one day to hold a talent competition, and the proceeds will be donated to purchase aircraft for birthday greetings. The dance halls have enthusiastically supported this. Details have been reported in various newspapers. The Yuegong Dance Hall held a consecutive three-day event on the 11th, 14th, and 15th, with the first two nights being extremely crowded.

<h3>Thirty-Six Gangs Extort Funeral Processions  You Amao and Others Are Detestable</h3>
<p>Shi Dafu, a 23-year-old resident of Nanshiang, living at No. 4, Qinxu Lane, Mai Shan Road, recently had his grandfather pass away in the hospital. The body was moved to the Xiyin Public Place in Liufen Lane, Jiumu Field, in the city for encoffining. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the funeral procession was scheduled to begin, and all kinds of ceremonial guards were prepared. Unexpectedly, You Amao (28 years old, from Suzhou) leading many people, forcibly demanded to be hired to carry the bier and high lanterns. Otherwise, they would cause trouble and obstruct the procession. Due to time constraints, Shi reluctantly gave them a few dollars in hopes of resolving the matter. However, You Amao and others took advantage of their strength to coerce and extort, insisting on carrying the spirit pavilion and high lanterns. Fearing delays, Shi called the police, and Yan Anguo arrested them and took them to the Old North Gate Police Station. After interrogation by Inspector Hu, it was determined that the case involved an attempt to extort money and was akin to coercion and extortion. Considering their ignorance, a light sentence of detention was imposed as punishment.</p>
<h3>Qidong Robbers Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Detective Xu Guodong of the Municipal Public Security Bureau previously received a report from Detective Xu Hongfu of Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, stating that many robbers from that area had fled to Shanghai and were hiding at No. 695 Huasheng Road and No. 128 Jining Road in the Public Concession. Therefore, at 5 PM the day before yesterday, he reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, requesting assistance with the arrest. The head of the station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Huang Yousan, Chen Laoquan, Qian Jinzhang, and Yuan Yuchang, all from Haimen, along with a special-style knife with a sheath, and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to Criminal Court Three of the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the situation and stated that the ringleader of the robbery was Dai Akang, who lived at No. 695 Huasheng Road. He escaped while being arrested, and only the suspect Yuan Yuchang was arrested. He requested a personal escort because the representative from Qidong County had not arrived. Judge Zhong Qing briefly questioned Huang Yousan and the other three and ordered that they remain in detention for a review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Small Fire at Lan Ni Du</h3>
<p>In the home of Ji Alin, a resident of Tongzhou, in the small alley west of the Huayuan Stone Bridge on Lan Ni Du Road in Pudong, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen at 3:10 AM yesterday morning. The family woke up in a panic from their sleep and ran outside to call for help. The Pudong District Fire Brigade rushed to the scene upon receiving the report and quickly applied water to prevent the fire from spreading, and used four fire extinguishers to extinguish the flames. Only one bungalow was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Daxin Dance Hall Set to Open Soon</h3>
<p>The Daxin Dance Hall, which has been rumored for a long time, has not yet announced its opening date due to the very extensive decoration work that has been ongoing for more than two months. Yesterday, the reporter visited the hall and saw that all the projects had been completed. The hall is located on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company and has a very large area. Except for the Chinese and Western kitchen occupying the northeast corner, the entire area is used as a dance hall. The four sides of the hall are surrounded by reinforced concrete walls to isolate the sound. The side facing south is the music stage, designed by the famous Persian engineer Forster, adopting the latest and most luxurious style of European and American dance halls. The remaining three sides are seating for the guests, made of spring-padded leather, resembling first-class trains, very comfortable. They were designed by Mao Lianqing, the owner of Mao Quantai Woodworking Company. After Mao abandoned the woodworking industry, he devoted himself to the study of interior decoration. This time, he provided the designs for the Daxin Dance Hall and undertook the construction of the wood and water projects, earning the praise of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Building Department. The art part of the hall is handled by an American decoration expert, and the red neon lights are packaged by the Datong Neon Electric Company. All projects are progressing rapidly due to the division of labor and cooperation. It is expected that the opening will be around the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Continued Transactions by Japanese Merchants. New Sesame Soars Again. Soybean Outlets Increase Sharply. Market Prices Remain Firm.</h3>
<p>Foreign firms have few new sesame sales, but the outlets remain very active. The night before last, Japanese merchants concluded deals for 200 tons, with prices opening at $12.20, for delivery in October and November. The goods were not differentiated by yellow or white sesame. Yesterday, the market price continued to rise, quoted at $12.50, but no transactions occurred. The overall trend is temporarily downward. Apart from Chengmen soybeans, which rely solely on local small sesame shops and a few vermicelli merchants for sales, causing the market price to decline, other soybeans remain quietly firm. However, the number of transactions has increased significantly. Manufacturers purchased over 4,500 bags of Poyang, Sanyang, and Duchang soybeans, and over 1,000 bags of Yangqing soybeans. Local Fuzhou merchants purchased 1,200-1,300 bags of Chengmen and Jiangqiao soybeans, and 400 bags of Changzhou buffalo hide yellow soybeans.</p>

A table is provided below (unit: metric quintals).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total amount of black and white sesame transported to various countries from January to July this year is as follows:</p>
<p>Kexian Rice Transactions Still Quite Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, both the arrival and sales of Kexian rice were brisk. Early and late rice from Jiangxi, Hunan, Shashi, Hankou, Wenzhou, and other regions arrived in whole batches yesterday. The market was initially weak, but the local Kexian rice was selling exceptionally well, with inquiries from Ningbo and Beiyang. Consequently, late rice from Jiangxi and other regions saw a slight rebound of several fen to nearly a jiao. Total transactions included 6,658 bags of Jiangxi rice, 4,184 bags of Hunan rice, 1,380 bags of Shashi and Hankou brown rice, 1,400 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 805 bags of Zhouzhou rice. River Rice Sales are Smoother Than Before.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Rice sources from various gangs arrived on the 16th and 17th, totaling 1,300 to 1,400 shi. Local sales have slightly livened up. Both the North and South gangs purchased over 500 bags, so the market situation has tightened slightly.

<p>Cotton Yarn Market</p>
<p>The Trend of Marked Yarn is Becoming More Solid. Actual Sales are Progressively Developing. Qingdao Yarn Market Experiences a Supply Squeeze and Soaring Prices. Market Sentiment is Boosted Accordingly.</p>
<p>The yarn market started calmly and then rose, but the trend is exceptionally strong. This is because there are positive sales reports from various regions. In fact, it seems that various parties are starting to move after a period of quiet. Therefore, market sentiment has turned bullish. In addition, the yarn inventory of various factories is gradually decreasing, and there is hope for yarn to be shipped out of warehouses. According to industry insiders, 32-count yarn in Qingdao is experiencing a supply squeeze and soaring prices. Market sentiment is increasingly upbeat, with prices rebounding after a fall. The yarn price has surged by $1.40 this month.</p>
<p>In the initial trading of marked yarn, prices for all months were sluggish, with uncertain price differences of two to three jiao. Most traders had a bearish outlook, and the pressure was significant. In the initial trading, the price for the current month suddenly fell by six jiao. As trading progressed to distant months, the momentum slightly strengthened. By the time of the Sanmu trading session, the situation changed rapidly. Buyers in the market were active, with yarn sales developing well. The Qingdao yarn market saw a significant rise, and market sentiment suddenly became heated. The current month jumped by $1.40, and distant months rose by six to seven jiao to one yuan. Run Kang and Changfeng continued to purchase, tightening the market further. As a result, prices for all months rose by six to seven jiao to $1.14 compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 850 bales, Tongji 2,000 bales, Juxing 1,000 bales, Yuda 1,450 bales, Dafeng 1,050 bales, Mingde 2,300 bales, Xingchang 1,150 bales, Fengtai 2,250 bales, Yichang 650 bales, and Dachang 1,250 bales. Jinchang purchased 2,100 bales, Dachangcheng 1,800 bales, Changfeng 2,000 bales, Run Kang 4,100 bales, Tonghe 1,600 bales, and Shengyuan 750 bales.

<p>Actual yarn sales are particularly active. Shenxin Factory sold over 4,000 bales of 20-count and 17-count futures yarn, for delivery from October to December. Fellow traders purchased 2,150 bales, and the Tianjin gang purchased 1,000 bales. The remaining yarn was purchased by gangs from Henan, the interior, Xuzhou, and other regions.

<p>Changsha 20, Henan 63.</p>
<h3>The Rising Trend of American Cotton Has Subsided. Cotton Prices Lack Momentum for Further Increase.</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly stable. This is because American cotton has rebounded slightly after a large increase, while Indian cotton is steadily rising, giving market sentiment a boost. However, most cotton merchants believe that the weather is favorable and the new cotton production will be abundant, so they have a bearish outlook on new cotton, and the pressure is significant. Only gold merchants and flour merchants are consistently inclined to purchase, so the competition between bullish and bearish parties is fierce.</p>
<h3>Marked Cotton Starts Weak and Ends Strong.</h3>
<p>In the initial trading of marked cotton, the bearish party was very active due to the subsided rising trend of American cotton and the favorable weather for new cotton production. However, buyers were still bravely moving forward. Nevertheless, cotton merchants were eager to sell, and the pressure increased. Prices for all months fell by two to three jiao. Unexpectedly, in the second trading session, Run Kang, Changfeng, and Juxing continued to absorb, and the market price was effectively supported, returning to a favorable state. By the time of the third closing session, the yarn market had stabilized, American cotton had rebounded slightly after a large increase, and the buying momentum remained strong, causing prices to rise. As a result, prices for all months rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,900 dan, Dafu 2,400 dan, Dafeng 2,200 dan, Fengtai 3,700 dan, Shenji 1,600 dan, Yichang 1,100 dan, Changfeng 1,600 dan, Tonghe 2,000 dan, Changhe 2,700 dan, and Shenchang 1,300 dan. Hengyi purchased 1,000 dan, Juxing 4,900 dan, Fengji 1,000 dan, Hexing 1,200 dan, Dafengcheng 3,200 dan, Run Kang 5,000 dan, Hengchang 1,200 dan, and Chong'an 1,500 dan. The highest and lowest market prices for the half-day session are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>There is No Source of Spot Cotton.</h3>
<p>Spot cotton sales are ordinary. Factories are mostly observing and not moving forward. There is no source of supply.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Surges and American Cotton Remains Calm.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with rising prices due to continued dry weather and hindered cotton harvesting in the west. Brokers and foreign firms purchased, and prices for all months rose by 8 to 11 points. There were not many sellers, and hedging was calm. Spot demand was quiet. Subsequently, the market situation did not fluctuate much. Before closing, the market trend softened, showing signs of decline. As a result, spot prices fell by 1 point, and futures prices fell by 2 points to a rise of 1 point. English cotton spot and futures prices both rose by 6 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by European exporters, short covering, speculator purchases, and unfavorable weather in India. Pingguo rose by 3.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 4.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 4.5 to 4.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 13th).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 14th was: Bairoxi for July-August delivery at 224 rupees, down 1.75 rupees; Bairoxi for April-May delivery at 214.5 rupees, down 1.25 rupees; Aomula for December-January delivery at 195 rupees, down 2.25 rupees.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Tianjin and Shanxi Merchants are Taking Action.</p>
<p>—Preventing Smuggling Seems to be Gradually Effective—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a continuous rise in marked yarn and cotton. The spot goods of piece goods are very scarce. Sales for autumn are stirring in various regions. It is said that because various places are stepping up efforts to prevent smuggling, the demand for domestic products has improved. The market sentiment is strong. Therefore, Donghua fine cloth and fine twill have continued to rise by 0.025 yuan per piece. The Tianjin gang, due to the cessation of smuggled goods, has gradually increased its purchases. They continued to purchase 300 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill from this factory and the British Jardine Matheson factory, as well as new corduroy, feathers, and white velvet from this factory. It is reported that the local goods inventory in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong is low. However, because the sales prices are quite harsh, the purchase interest is low. Business in the future will definitely improve. The sales of the Yangtze River gang are still quite good, and the momentum of Zhejiang and Fujian is gradually becoming strong. Yesterday, over 200 pieces of goods were purchased, mainly consisting of broadcloth, Zhigong feathers, crepe de chine, yuan twill, and blue cloth. Shanxi and Henan purchased over 100 boxes of Zhigong broadcloth, yuan twill, blue cloth, and printed Zhigong broadcloth. Local shops and dyeing factories are particularly active, purchasing a large quantity of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, bleached cloth, striped plain Fu silk, various printed cloths, plain feathers, and various velvet goods.</p>
<p>Dalong Broadcloth is in Demand in Sichuan</p>
<p>The domestic Yangcheng brand Dalong broadcloth, yuan constant gray plain color, is selling very well in the market. Merchants from Changsha, Chongqing, and Chengdu have recently been taking action. Yesterday, Huaxin handled over 20 boxes, with a net price of 2.75 yuan. Other products such as Shanghai broadcloth and Zhanghua 918 plain broadcloth are also continuing to see transactions. However, the outlets are not as strong as Dalong goods. Yesterday, Zhanghua 918 sold for 2.85 yuan, and Shanghai single-width broadcloth sold for 1.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>The Silk Market Seems to Have Stabilized</p>
<p>Yesterday, the white New York silk market was slightly firm. Japanese and Chinese silk prices remained unchanged. Spot prices rose by 0.035 yuan, and futures prices rose by 0.01 yuan. Yokohama silk prices rose by 5 yuan for spot goods and 1 yuan for futures. The decline in silk prices has been sufficiently reversed, and it seems to have stabilized. Silk transactions in Shanghai are still only sporadic. Yesterday, only Pilao and other firms slightly increased their purchases. White factory silk prices did not change much. Hand-reeled silk is relatively firm and smooth, and only merchants from Shandong and Henan inquired about it.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Although Pure Gold Fell, Standard Gold Remains in Excess Demand</p>
<p>The gold market initially fell yesterday due to the decline in pure gold in London. Later, because the central government still had the intention to open current prices, it was soon pulled up again. Therefore, the overall trend was very stable.

After the opening, large buyers joined together to purchase gold bars, and the central bank opened current prices again, causing buying sentiment to turn strong. Therefore, the exchange rates of HSBC, England, and America, as well as the silver balance tax, remained unchanged. However, domestic demand still exceeded supply, and prices gradually rose. Sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing a slight pullback. However, there were still spot buyers taking advantage of the low prices, so prices were held up again. Therefore, the trend was stable at noon. Today marks the start of the September-October swap. The bullish party paid 1 to 2.5 yuan for the forecast. Here is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day:</p>

Futai, Yongqia, Lanfu, Taiheng, Yongde, Shengyuan, Yongda, and Decheng continued to purchase. The central bank opened current prices from time to time, and the rumor of a price of 27 yuan sparked buying interest. Therefore, although the exchange rates of HSBC, England, and America, as well as the silver balance tax, did not move, they still rose to 7 yuan. Yicheng, Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng took advantage of the high prices to supply, lowering the price to 6.5 yuan. Futai, Yongfu, and Taiheng still paid. The closing price at noon was 1,126.8 yuan, slightly lower after the closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was 1,124.9 yuan for the central bank's standard gold price, a decrease. In terms of the closing price, the increase was less than 2 yuan. The registration price for this month was 1,124 yuan, and for September it was 1,127 yuan. The morning make-up price was 1,124 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were quoted at an additional 15 yuan. The selling price for smelting gold was 16.5 yuan, and the buying price was 13 yuan, but no transactions occurred. The central government supplied current prices, and the overall trend was bullish. For the August-September swap, Jingfu paid Shengyuan Yong 7 yuan, 1.8 yuan. For this swap, the bearish party paid over 2 yuan for the forecast.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. In summary, Futai Heng, Yitai, Yongqing, Fasheng, Shengyuan, Yongqia, Feng, Yongfu, Yuanyuan, Maomao, and Yong, etc., were on the buying side.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bond Market Trends Towards Bullish</p>

<h3>Record of the World Games Delegation's Accompanying Expedition, Letter 7, Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>(36) Special Train Through Austria to Germany</p>
<p>On the 22nd, after a brief morning, the athletes, still half-asleep, had breakfast and hurriedly went to the train station. The German government had prepared three special trains to welcome them in Venice, which had been parked at the station for two days. The special trains were all second class, with eight compartments each, each compartment with six seats, just enough for everyone. The facilities of European second-class trains were no less than those of first-class trains in China. Two rows of velvet benches faced each other, divided into six seats. When the armrests were lifted, they could also be used as berths. The athletes were assigned seats according to their teams, and for a while, there was much talking and laughter, making it very lively.</p>
<p>At 7:15, the special train left Venice station and sped forward. On both sides of the railway, there were semi-plains, with small villages not far apart. The houses were clean and tidy, even better than the cities in China. In each village, there were always one or two churches, with towering spires and a solemn atmosphere, showing that religion in Europe still occupied a very strong position. All the cultivable land was planted with various agricultural products, a green field with no barren areas. The irrigation machines placed in the fields did not require human management, and constantly sprayed water droplets, falling like showers of rain. Compared with China's rural areas, European rural areas cannot help but give people a sense of another world.</p>
<p>After the train had travelled for a while, it entered the Alps. The towering mountains on both sides of the railway rose straight into the clouds, with sheer cliffs and extremely dangerous terrain. Looking into the distance, the highest peaks of the Alps were covered with snow and dense clouds. A wide stream formed by mountain springs flowed along the foot of the mountains, its current extremely rapid. A paved asphalt road ran parallel to the railway, with cars coming and going from time to time. While admiring the magnificent and beautiful scenery, we were even more amazed by the development of its material construction. However, the trees on the mountains were very short, and it could be seen at a glance that they had only been planted after Mussolini came to power. The great old Italian Empire was as decadent as China, but Fascist Italy was developing everything on the road to progress.</p>
<p>The train moved towards the Alps plateau, passing through dozens of large and small tunnels. The climate was almost like late autumn in China, with a bit of chill. At about 1 p.m., it arrived at Brennero, already the border of Italy. As usual, military police checked passports. When the train arrived at Innsbruck, Austria, the Austrian army checked passports again. The procedures were very simple.</p>
<p>Although Italy and Austria were separated by only one mountain, the scenery was very different. Austria does not produce coal, but its electric power industry is very developed, so the machines are powered by electricity. There is no coal ash flying around, and the speed is extremely fast. The mountains are covered with forests, which are black, and the ground is lined with green pastures. The scenery is beautiful, far from what can be found in Italy. The sparse rural areas are arranged neatly and cleanly, almost like gardens. According to Chen Meijun (former professor at Peking University, now in Europe researching agriculture and forestry), who was on the same train, Germany and Austria pay great attention to forestry. Forests occupy a quarter of Germany's entire territory, and have been cultivated for decades. Now, some parts have been felled and new seedlings planted. Austria follows and imitates Germany in everything. Forest cultivation has also been going on for more than twenty years and has not yet been felled, so the scenery is particularly beautiful. Both Germany and Austria have special laws for the protection of forests, stipulating a certain period each year for hunting and felling. Those who violate the forest law are severely punished. However, the people of both countries have received good education from an early age and know how to protect forests, and have never destroyed them. Especially in Germany, the trees planted on both sides of the roads are fruit trees, which not only have red flowers and green leaves, making the scenery along the line more beautiful, but also increase a large amount of revenue for the country. However, every year when the fruits ripen, even passers-by who are thirsty will never pick one. The people's training in public morality has reached such a degree that it is no wonder that after the trauma of the Great War, the German nation was able to restore its position in just over a decade.</p>
<p>(37) Arrival in Munich</p>
<p>The special train travelled through garden-like Austria for six hours and entered German territory. At 7:30 p.m., it arrived in Munich, the birthplace of the National Socialist Party and the largest city in southern Germany. Representatives from the German Propaganda Department, representatives from the Munich Municipal Government, Qiu Changkang from the Chinese Embassy in Germany, Qian Pinsong from the Kuomintang branch in Germany, Zhang Jun, the president of the Chinese Students Association in Munich, and more than thirty students welcomed us at the station. After getting off the train and forming a line, a simple welcome meeting was held. First, Ms. Li Licong and Li Shujia, who were studying in Munich, presented flowers. Then, each representative gave a short welcome speech. The delegation was addressed by Shen Siliang, who led everyone in shouting "Long live" for both countries. The atmosphere was extremely solemn and tense. After the ceremony, representatives from the Munich Municipal Government invited us to a restaurant for dinner. As we lined up in neat rows on the road and walked forward in an orderly manner, everyone stopped to watch and waved to welcome us, which made us feel extremely excited.</p>
<p>After 9 p.m., the dinner ended. Representatives from the German Propaganda Department and the Municipal Government gave speeches one after another. Munich is not only the birthplace of the National Socialist Party revolution and the center of German art, but also famous for its beer production. The representative of the Municipal Government said in the conclusion of his speech that because of the suddenness of the occasion, they were unable to provide as much hospitality as they would have liked, and hoped that when we returned home in the future, we could stay in Munich for a few more days and drink a few cups of beer. The tone was humorous and witty, and the whole audience burst into laughter. After Shen Siliang's response, the band in the restaurant played the Chinese national anthem while everyone stood up. After the anthem, the German national anthem was played again. At this time, all the Germans in the audience, even those standing outside watching the excitement, raised their right hands and saluted, their attitude extremely serious. It can be seen that patriotism is very common and deeply imprinted in everyone's minds. Finally, Xu Minhui led everyone in shouting "Long live" for both countries. We then left the restaurant in a friendly atmosphere and were led by representatives of the Municipal Government to visit the National Socialist Party Revolution Memorial Hall and Cemetery.</p>
<p>When Hitler organized the National Socialist Party and began the revolution, Munich was his base. On January 9, 1923, his secret agency was discovered by the military police, who went to arrest him. After some resistance, sixteen party members were killed and Hitler himself was injured. From then on, the power of the National Socialist Party grew day by day, and it finally took control of the entire country's political power. The National Socialist Party converted the original site of this secret agency into a revolution memorial hall, regarding it as the most important page in the history of the revolution. In front of the memorial hall's plaza, two party flags more than ten feet high were erected. Ten large wreaths were placed on the steps to commemorate the sixteen party members who died. In the dim light of the night, we came to visit this National Socialist Party revolutionary victory site, and could not help but feel awe.</p>
<p>The cemetery of the party members who died was not far from the memorial hall. In the middle of a square more than a thousand meters wide, two pavilions were built, each divided into two rows, housing eight iron coffins. Several great memorial halls were built around the square, creating an extremely solemn and respectful atmosphere. We strolled around the cemetery for a week, returned to the station at 11:45 p.m., and boarded the train again to head towards Berlin.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Implement Educational Measures for Out-of-School Citizens; Order Issued to Various Departments and Bureaus to Follow and Submit for Approval</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th dispatch from the Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education believes that although there are no precise surveys of out-of-school citizens in China, the estimated number of out-of-school people aged 16 to 45 is 200 million. In addition, there are more than 30 million school-age children who are out of school. In recent years, due to the rigorous implementation of compulsory education, all school-age children are expected to receive primary school education in three or four years. For the larger number of older out-of-school citizens, it is also urgent to find ways to enable them to receive supplementary education, so that national consciousness and modern life common sense can be gradually popularized among the general public, which will greatly increase the strength for national construction and survival. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, there are more than 37,000 civil schools in the country, with a total of more than 1.3 million students, and an annual budget of more than 1.9 million yuan. Moreover, provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing have already implemented compulsory literacy education as appropriate. More than two provinces and cities have also held civic training, which also has the meaning of civic education. However, the teaching objectives and training methods vary, and the number of people receiving education accounts for a very small proportion of the number of out-of-school people. Even in places where civic education is held, the system and work should be improved. The Ministry of Education, after understanding the actual situation of various provinces and cities, deeply feels that in the future promotion of civic education, there should be considerable unity in the training objectives, and in the implementation methods, various provinces and cities should have certain plans and submit them for approval and implementation year by year. The ministry has drafted an outline of measures for implementing supplementary education for out-of-school citizens and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. On the 14th, an order was issued to various education departments and bureaus, requesting that a six-year implementation plan outline be drafted, as well as a detailed implementation plan for the 25th year and the number of textbooks required for civil schools, and submitted to the ministry for approval by September 15 at the latest.</p>

<h3>Grain: Current Wheat Nears Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, was generally stable. The quoted price of foreign wheat rebounded by between four and seven cents, so the opening prices for each month were three to five cents better than the previous day. The current month once opened as high as 4.98 yuan due to the continued brisk demand for current wheat. September also reached 5.13 yuan, October reached 2.24 yuan, November reached 2.34 yuan, December reached 2.38 yuan, and January reached 2.46 yuan. Afterwards, because the flour market eased, the bulls retreated, and the prices fell by three to four cents from the highest. As a result of the closing, except for January, which was down by a small one cent, the rest were still two to three cents better. The future situation is difficult to ease quickly due to the tight spot market. The current wheat market is still tight. Shandong wheat opened at five yuan, Zhangbaling Wuhe wheat at 4.98 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 4.09 yuan, and 4.08 yuan for secondary wheat. Huai'an wheat opened at 4.08 yuan, and 4.073 yuan for secondary wheat. Qingjiang wheat opened at 4.093 yuan, and 4.083 yuan for secondary wheat. Yangzhou wheat opened at 4.072 yuan, and 4.07 yuan for the final bid. Liuhe wheat opened at 4.081 yuan, Chuzhou wheat opened at 4.091 yuan, Hankou wheat opened at 4.066 yuan, and 4.06 yuan for secondary wheat. Daorenqiao wheat opened at 4.08 yuan, and 4.075 yuan for secondary wheat. Gaoyou wheat opened at 4.075 yuan, and 4.073 yuan for secondary wheat. Fuxin went to 13,000 bags, and Fufeng went to 7,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Increased Flour Tax in Yingkou</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market remained stable. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago continued to improve by four to five cents, and Canada rose by five to seven cents. When the market opened, due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat prices and the fact that there was no clear solution to the export of wheat in China, the minds of those inside and outside the industry were naturally fixed. The opening price for the current month reached a high of 2.195 yuan, and September to December also showed an improvement of one to two cents. Until after the second session, due to rumors that there was an increase in flour tax in Yingkou and other places, the factory slightly sold off, so the market atmosphere for each month was slightly weak, down by one cent or so compared to the initial opening, but still one cent or so better than the previous day for the near term, and one cent or so worse for the distant term. In the future, if there are no special circumstances, it may remain stable in the near term and weak in the long term.</p>
