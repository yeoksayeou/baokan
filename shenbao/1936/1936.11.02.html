<h3>最近中國財政之分析（中）</h3>
<p>— 孫懷仁</p>
<p>中國財政上歷來收支的不能平衡，差不多與各國的情形髣髴，是由於軍債兩費過度膨脹所造成，但最近二三年來的不足額，却還更包藏了一個新的因素，就是稅收的减少—這裏當然以關稅的减少爲最顯著。</p>
<p>最近三年來預算中的租稅收入，二十三年度爲七萬三千一百萬元，二十四年度爲六萬九千六百萬元，較上年度已减少三千五百萬元，到最近的二十五年度，租稅收入共計爲六萬八千萬元，較上年度又减少了一千六百萬元，較前年度已减少了五千一百萬元。這個數字，還是冠冕堂皇的預算假定，在實際上也許比這個更减少得利害。舉一個例來說，譬如二十二年度的租稅預决算數字，其相差就如决表：（單位千元）</p>
<p>在這裏，除鹽統二稅以外，全部都比預算爲數减少。在中國的財政收入上，向來以關稅爲最重要，但這幾年來却在一直綫的降下，據二十四年的海關年刋的統計，最近五年來的關稅收入，年年都在减少，二十四年度僅收三萬一千五百萬元，比較民國二十年時的數字，已减少了七千萬元。這種關稅的减少，一方面固然由於年來進口貨减少之故，另一方面却是由於走私漸趨旺盛之故。據本月初新聞的報道，從去年八月以來，單僅華北一地因走私所受關稅之損失，卽達九千萬元之譜。至於鹽稅一項，年來因努力增高稅率與改換衡制（改司馬秤爲市秤約差二〇％）的結果，反在逐年增加之中，民國二十四年全年鹽稅收入爲一萬八千四百萬元，比較五年前的民國二十年數字，已增一千四百萬元。至於統稅一項，也因稅率的加增與貨物種類的加多，也在增加之中。計民國二十四年的收數爲一萬一千六百萬元，比較民國二十年已增三千六百萬元。因此，最近五年來關鹽統三大稅收的變化，是得不償失，鹽統兩稅合計不過增加了五千萬元，而關稅一項却已减少了七千萬元。</p>
<p>時至今日，外來的壓迫，愈益嚴重，關稅恐怕還要更加减少收入，至於鹽稅大致也不會再增、年來南北鹽民之暴動以及搶鹽風潮之澎湃，都是表明着鹽稅負担已至極大限）。而且過去鹽稅增加的還有一個原因，並不是人民實際眞正　費那麼多的鹽，而是鹽塲催促盡量把鹽運出去，同時便就運出去的鹽徵稅的結果．因此過去的鹽稅增加，一部分是含有寅吃卯糧的性質的。只有統稅一項，比較還有前途，中央政府的統一愈趨完成，當然統稅也愈趨增加，但要以增加的統稅，來彌補關稅的减少，這在事實上是絕對不可能的！前面我們所舉出來的那個二十二年度的稅收例子中，大部分租稅的實收數，雖然都比預算數來得少，但幸而因爲鹽統兩稅有一個大量的增加，因此，實際稅收的合計額，總算還超過了預算合計數，但如今的情形不同了，最近的二十五年度中，關稅無論如何都還要减少（在走私無法杜絕的情形下，關稅的减少當不成問題，卽令走私勢戢，恐怕稅率的减低也已是不可避免，這樣，當然也將使關稅减少收入吧）；鹽稅則已入停頓狀態，再也不能像二十二年度那樣，會增加於預算數字以上；其他統稅以外的各種稅收其减少更是意料中事，在這裏，只有統稅與所得稅兩項，比較尚不至與預算大差，然而兩者合計，年收也不過祇有一萬三千七百八十萬元而已。</p>
<p>這種租稅收入的漸减傾向，當局並不是不知道的，因　，二十五年度稅收的預算已比前兩年度要减少了數千萬元。但二十五年度稅收預算雖然减少，無如二十五年度的支出，却是一個空前的大額，因此，爲求收支預算表面上的適合起見，纔故意的政策的把租稅外的收入虛列一下，（見前列表）。譬如國有營業純益一項大部分就是中央銀行的盈餘及各項官股的利益血已，像去年度那樣，中央銀行雖因白銀國有而得着了龐大的利益，但這個倒底是臨時性質的。在沒有繼續新創國營事業的前提卜，要年年的國有營業純益都有去年那樣的數字，絕對是困難的。本來在二十五年度預算草案中，這項純益已較前年度少列二千八百餘萬元，然而，爲求收支的表面適合，依然列着四千一百三十九萬餘元。</p>
<p>由上所述，我們對於最近二十五年度預算的歲入方面看，已發見了牠的三大缺陷，第一是租稅收入的减少，第二是其他收入的虛列；第三是債欵收入的加大。單就這三點看，已很足以說明最近、財政是有些不很容易平衡了，尤其像債欵收入的增多，更不僅是表示最近財政不能平衡，而且還暗示着本來也有些難以平衡。因爲目前債欵的加多，就是暗示着未來債務費支出的加大。又何况近年中國發債條件非常苛刻，譬如內債的發行，從民十六到二十二年，共發行十一萬三千萬元，而政府實收只有六萬五千萬元左右，約爲五折七扣。這樣一種不當的發行，不僅使大部分國民受不當的損失，而且是作繭自縛一的使財政永遠不易平衡。過去發行了十餘萬萬元的公債，而到本年二月以前，中央財政每月尚須不敷二千四百萬至二千七百萬元之譜。這正是說明公債政策的調整財政不平衡，是一件如何「不揣共本而齊共末」的措置了。</p>
<p>中央在這樣財政極度困難之中。開始了一個新的平衡策略，這就是本年二月的强制掉換公債，把過去發行的三十一種公債，掉換成了五種統一公債，合計十四萬六千萬元平均延長十年的償還期間，這樣使每年支出的債務費减少一些，同時，騰出一部分基金來發新公債，這主要的新公債就是三萬四千萬元的復興公債。而二十五年度預算中債欵收入之所以比前兩年度爲增加者，也就是因爲發債基金比較有着落之故。本年所發的復興公債，原說是用於生產事業及完成法幣政策的，但據新聞的報道說：「此項公債不在市面流通，亦不在證券市塲公開出售，其大部分存於中央中國交通三行，作爲保證，準備發行鈔票。中央過去六個月，已向銀行透支一萬五千萬元，最近六個月至少仍需欵一萬五千萬元，合計三萬萬元。但復興公債照票面九八折發行，計共約三萬一千萬元，償還銀行透支後，僅足半年之用。」三月十六日北平晨報）這樣可知以公債來平衡收支的政策，政府還不想放棄。</p>
<p>本年二月公債整理以後，每年公債本利的償付，在最初一二年中，可以比較整理前的數字，約减四〇％左右，這减少的四〇％的基金，充其量不過尚有六七萬萬元公債可發，如今復興公債已發了　三萬萬元以上，加上二十五年度預算中借欵收入的一萬五千萬元（實際上一定不止此數），到了明年，恐怕公債又難以再發了吧。那末，公債政策又將如何去運用呢？</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀二十三年度財政報告書</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>我國中央財政。自民國十八年度以還。財部按年有財政報吿之發表。昭示國人以　支之實情。爲鑒往策來之張本。用意良善也。今茲二十三年度及該期以後之情形。業於本日公布。洋洋數萬言。條分縷析。詳述些二年來困苦顚沛之財政。與其擘劃改革之經過。吾人展誦再三。深佩當局能以最大之努力。鼓其最大之勇氣。斬荆披棘。克服一切之難關。而使財政漸趨安定。且報吿結論中又謂「政府在財政上所渴望者。不僅收支相抵而已。且冀財政日臻健全。俾有餘力以開發國內經濟資源。並改進人民之生活。」寥寥數語。尤中肯綮。然而吾人就報吿中之度支情形而論。深覺欲達此理想之境地。中途尙不無阻碍。而猶有待於當局之克服者。請爲陳之。</p>
<p>由來論理財之道者。多主「量出爲入。」此一財政之原則。在國家平時興盛之際。自爲絕對之眞理。而無可懷疑者。然當國步維艱。經濟衰頹之秋。强欲依此原則而進行。不獨困難滋多。且或轉致財政於混亂也。最近我國支出。年有膨脹。而收入之增加不逮。以致財政收支。虧短纍纍。據財政報吿之數字。則二十三年度之此種情形。尤爲顯著。虧短之數。計達總支出凈數之二〇·八%。唯其中有一部分之虧短。乃爲政府投資之所費。故純粹之短絀僅爲一三。％左右。較之二十二年度之比率。實已减低。此種現象。在今日百孔千瘡之情形下。雖未始非一可喜之事實。然而距收支平衡之理想。尙隔一問。深望當局於此。能爲百尺竿頭之努力。則中國財政之癥結庶有豸乎。</p>
<p>夫如何而可以使收支平衡乎。此在財政報吿中已昭示吾人以數原則。其在財政本身方面者有下列三點。一曰。凡屬不需要或不生產之開支。應一律撙節。餘欵以供生產及建設上之用途。二曰。甄別及訓練稅收人員。藉資增加行政效率。三。曰整理現行稅收。開徵良好新稅。以達增加稅收而不增加入民負担之目的。凡此三項原則。若能假以時日。按步實現。則稅收增加之結果。自不難使收支歸於平衡。然終非一蹴而可以就也。雖然。目前當局整理財政之意志。固不僅以收支之平衡爲已足。但吾人竊以爲對今日顛沛困苦之財政。求收支之平衡。實爲唯一之要圖。收支而能平衡。然後再徐圖其他之改善。急其急。緩其緩。庶事半而功可以倍也。</p>
<p>顱今日收支之不能平衡。誠如財政報吿中所謂由於稅入之銳减。而稅收之所以銳减者。半由於外來之壓迫。如走私等事之猖獗。半由於國內經濟之不景氣。此種內外交攻所釀成之收入减少。自非以財政政策。於短期間中可使其復原者。第在消極方面。亦可藉財政政策之運用。减低其對於財政之壓迫。其法卽收支之「量入爲出」也。量入爲出。雖非財政上之正則。然在目前內外交困之情形下。要亦不失爲勵精刻苦以渡難關之手段。故前述第一原則中之上半部。吾人當抱絕對之同意。唯其下半部之所謂「餘欵以供生產及建設上之用途。」吾人則以爲應有限度。卽此種生產與建設爲一時之不可緩者。若可以緩。則亦不必因有餘欵而與辦。藉以節省財政之支出。而以减少後日財政之短虧。再者欲達量入爲出收支平衡之目的。則財政之預算。尤不能不有嚴格之遵守。卽財政報吿中所謂「須設立一更有效之預算制度。以資控制各項用途。」此亦實爲今日之要圖。若預算而不能有效。則收支安能望其平衡乎。卽如二十三年度之收支。各爲一億三百十萬元。趨出於是年度之預算者。計　一千一百三十萬元之鉅也。</p>

<h3>奸商運糧出境中　冀省民食大起恐慌　麺粉糧米行情飛漲甚速　某方大擧購米以充軍食</h3>
<p>保定通訊、冀境各縣、本年均幸豐收、民間方慶食料充足、糧價必落、乃事有出人意料者、所有麺粉米糧竟飛漲不已、民食問題、遂發生絕大恐慌、究其原因、略如下述、</p>
<p>民食恐慌</p>
<p>查冀省民食來源、除麵粉向賴滬商輸銷外、其他米糧、多賴各縣供給、乃邇來源幾形斷絕、遇有出售、其市價昻於昔日約半倍、麵粉一項、本省乾義公司出品之綠牌、昔日僅售三元五角、今竟漲至四元五角、其他紅牌·藍牌·黃牌、亦均較前增漲七八角不等、至於滬粉、則昻至五元而竟無貨、大米每包價達十六元、本地伏地米亦十四元五角、至高中西貢米每包漲達十九元許、卽最次之高中敏黨亦非十四元不能購到、其他高粱、綠豆·麥子等、每計均漲二三角、一般平民、無不憂形於色、引爲絕大恐慌、最近氣侯、已入嚴寒、其影響於社會治安、極關重要、四鄉農戶、雖自身秋收甚豐、但多被米麵商早以低價購定、至今只有坐失厚利、且本身尚須以高價購回、往返蒙損、徒喚奈何、</p>
<p>漲價原因</p>
<p>本省原爲農事最發達之地、本年又告豐收、其所以反患食糧恐慌者、（一）大農戶因見時局不寗、多購米麵儲藏、至自身所產之糧、絕不出售、（三）小農戶純賴每年糧產，易購衣物用品、所收糧穀、必先出售泰半、以致自身反覺食慌、（三）各麵粉公司及各大糧商、於秋收前、卽以低價將農產收買大半、（四）一般奸商、趁機操縱行情、（五）某方曾派人分在各地購定大批糧米、以充軍食、（六）奸商大規模之運糧出境、凡此種種、足使本省民食、發生絕大恐慌、中下級社會人民、尤感覺不安也、（十月三十一日）</p>

<p>民衆教育</p>
<p>掃除一個文盲，便是增厚一分民族自新的力量，也便是加强對敵人侵略的打擊，我們全上海的士女們！你喜歡增厚民挨自新的力量麼？也願意加强敵人侵略的打擊麼？只要照你的力量一年中節省幾個二元六角五分的法幣，就可以掃除一個——二個——三個——數百個的文盲了，何以見得？蓋依照我們上海女靑年會歷年創辦婦女民衆學校的經騐，（一九二三年始我們會內卽在全滬各區開辦平民敎育班數十區）只要有一間敎室（至少一間，最好二三間）一個或二個熱心敎育，有國家思想的敎員，每學期籌備若干經費，（一百元或數百元）卽可收錄數十人或數百個目不識了，年長失學的婦女學生，開班授課，（以前招生十分困難，自有成績以後，只嫌室小人多，現在竟愈來愈擁了）經四五月或一年的認眞敎授和訓練，（每日不過授課二小時，）學生們就都能書寫，加算，也能看簡單的報紙，發表簡單的演講，實行淸潔的衛生，也能改變她們守舊的思想，知道女人也是一個人，——一個重要的人，知這目己的家庭環境，社會狀况，國家地位，外敵侵略，又能改變她們的生活，知道團體生活的重要，互助互力的關係種種爲人應有的普通常識，可以說應有盡有了。照我們的統計，栽培這樣的一個極簡單極普通的公民，所耗去的財力至多要二元六角五分法幣，一比較貴族敎育，公子少爺，千金小姐們的求學費，每學期至少數百元，或近千元者，眞有天壤之別了，這不是極容易辦的事工麼？可惜注意的人太少了。</p>
<p>我們全滬的士女們，請大家起來共同担任救國基本的工作，希望上海的文盲，都因你們的惠澤，豁然開朗，走入光明之途，你們的功德眞是無量了。</p>
<p>我們本學期的婦女民衆學校有四區，分晨夜二班，學生春季四四四人，秋季七八八人，共計一千二百三十二人，我們的力量只有這些，請你們大家來帮忙罷！</p>

<p>俗話說「活到老學到老」，又說「一息尚存，不容稍懈，」這就是指示人們，世界的學問無窮，不要因成年而就恥學止學，所以上海女靑年會的成人敎育部，專爲成年會員們，和成年非會員們，實施種種敎育事業，使年長的婦女，仍得隨潮流前進，又可有機會和社會接觸，而免自然淘汰的危險，並藉本機關的團結，可以發展她們的天才，實行愛國的素志。茲將成人敎育的大概，略述如下。</p>
<p>（一）補習班：我們知道成年的婦女們，必有家庭資任，或有其他原因，不能全日在外受課，乃特開辦各柿補習班，如中文·英文·法文·德文·日文·中外烹飪·手工·縫紉·救護術·保姆班·打字縮寫·鋼琴·提琴·交際舞·踢躂舞等，每科每日一小時，或每週二三小時，使她們不致以學問，而荒家事也，不致以家事而忘學業，且求學之機會，可以增進新智識，認識新朋友，以去生活的單調，和枯燥的痛苦。</p>
<p>（二）體育塲：寸金地的上海婦女們，除操勞家事，和操勞公事的動作外，鮮有健身的運動，本會鑒於婦女體育的重要，特在靜安寺路會所之後，闢宏大之體育塲，內分網球·排球·籃球等，又有游泳（商借海軍靑年會游泳池）爲各界婦女業餘之暇，家事之後，操練身體之所。</p>
<p>（三）研究討論演講會：專組織團體，分研究時事，討論家事，演講國際大勢，宗敎眞理等等重要集團，爲改進恊助家庭社會國家之基礎。</p>
<p>（四）參觀旅行交誼會音樂會：我們要闡發她們戶外生活的興趣，養成她們正當娛樂的習慣，指示她們普通常識的途徑，聯絡她們互助團結的力量，乃有參觀名廠，旅行勝地，和交誼會音樂會等的發起。</p>
<p>（五）閱書室：本會預備少數的書籍，和各種報紙雜誌，以供本會會員們的瀏覽。</p>

<h3>滬市開工絲廠　僅有四十餘家　原料缺乏所致</h3>
<p>滬市各絲廠、因原料缺乏相繼停車、目下開工者、計滬南區寳泰·日新·兩家、特區同裕·怡和·裕源·等三家、滬北區積餘·美豐·久餘·大成·復昶·振祥·鼎昶·義成·勤益·宏昶·公大·裕泰·元興·元記·紹興·志成·泰綸··義昌永·鴻泰·協興·成豐·大豐·永興·義興·裕豐·預豐·興綸·久豐·恒蒼·等二十九家、虹口區計福綸·雲成·等十家、總計僅四十餘家、所有存繭、僅能維持至本年年終云、</p>
<h3>小麥來源稀少　粉廠原料缺乏</h3>
<p>新新社云、本市麵粉廠、邇來因小麥來源稀少、原料大感缺乏、欲購洋麥、又以價格太高、乃不得不相率减工、而各地需要甚殷、致市價日漲、記者探誌各情如决、</p>
<p>來源銳減</p>
<p>本市各麵粉廠之原料、除洋麥外、均仰給江北各縣高郵·泰州·鹽城·各地所產小麥、每年、運銷上海者、統計約有一百七八十萬包、今歲運滬數量、已達十分五六、邇來麵粉因粵津及南洋各地銷路暢達、需要甚殷、以致各地到滬小麥、不敷各廠消耗、而江北各地之存麥、受水淺運輸困難、及農村須待善價、故來源頓起稀少、每日到貨、僅七八萬包而已、</p>
<p>相率減國</p>
<p>各麵粉廠、以小麥來源有限、原料大感缺乏、且各糧食行、亦無現貨囤積、搜羅甚爲困難、雖粉銷暢旺、市價高翔、卒以原料稀少、不能盡量出廠應市、乃不得不忍痛相率减少工作、如福新·阜豐·裕興·等廠、莫不在减工或時作時輟之狀態、</p>
<p>未購洋麥</p>
<p>每年各麵粉廠所需之原料、除國產小麥、採用洋麥達十分之四五、據糧食業中稱、今歲因美國麥產年歲不住、報價甚高、澳洲麥雖傳說有輸出可能、但尚無確實消息、故各麵粉廠以洋麥售價、與國麥相差過多、太不合算、迄今尚未與各洋商訂購、</p>
<h3>時人行蹤錄</h3>
<p>新任駐美大使王正廷博士、昨日下午乘特快車出京、昨晚十時五十分抵滬日本駐華大使館陸軍武官喜多、海軍武官佐藤、及情報部長平岡熊川等四人、昨乘夜特快車晋京</p>

<h3>慕爾堂　救濟失業團</h3>

<h3>李鴻壽會計師講演　所得稅與會計改進</h3>
<p>本市立信會計師事務所李鴻壽會計師講演所得稅之實行、與會計改進之關係、茲錄之於後、</p>
<p>今之經營企業者、皆知競爭壟斷縱橫捭闔之策、僅可獲利於一時、而非長久之良法、於是乃感覺長久之有效方策、除以會計上已往之數字、分析比較、作未來之借鏡外、別無他塗、因此會計遂爲營業南針矣、會計之發展、可分爲三時期、第一、爲求簿記記載之完備、與時間　節省、此目的雖經達到、而結出决算表上之項目、是否正確、尚屬問題、故第二爲求估價之正確、然估價雖正確、决算表上所載之數字、雖屬確實、但不加比較分析、尚不能明白顯示、資產負債之狀况、及營業之情形、更不能知較往年情形爲進步或退步、以便從事改善、故第三爲决算表之比較與分析、會計先進國家、率已如是、至於吾國會計學之工史、尚屬幼雅、對於第一步歷作、尚未能盡臻完善、雖經多數會計學者之極力提倡、編著叢書、創辦學校、而其影響尚微、除小部份企業已注意估價問題、多數經濟企業者、仍以盈餘多寡爲資產估價之標準、我國工商機關、關於資產之估價、向無一定之標準、有年終結帳時、先將資產負債帳目、約略結估、得出盈虧約數、與其所需或希望之盈虧數相比、再確定估價之標準、如遇盈餘優厚之年則將存貨低估、多提折舊及壞帳準備、反之、則將存貨高佔、少提折舊及壞帳準備、甚至分文不提、以减少其虧損、或增加其盈餘、第二步之成績如是、第三步更可想而知、邇者、政府頒佈所得稅暫行條例、規定第一類爲營利事業所得、按照所得額、課稅、設使會計不正確、則所得額亦隨之不正確、過高則納稅多、而受意外之損失、過低則納稅少、而有逃稅之嫌、今後經營企業者、必不能冉以凑足盈餘卽爲完事矣、此所得稅之施行、有促成會計正確之趨勢、蓋有正確之會計、始有公平之課稅也、因此余不禁爲吾國會計前途之發達慶、而尤希望工商界領袖、早爲慮及、先行改進、以免對於應納之稅欵、有多納與逃稅之嫌、惟上述數項會計問題、各有其估價方法、亦各有其理由、爲中外會計學者所未解决之問題、而國家立法、又有立法之原則、故施行細則中必有詳細之規定、若含混不淸、商人擇一可少納稅欵之方法、政府將何辭以詰之耶、而所得稅暫行條例施行細則之四十九條中、僅於第十五條訂「計算第一類所得時、應就其所得總額內、减除營業期間實際開支、壞帳折舊盤存消耗公課及依法令所規定之公積金、以其餘額爲純益額、依照暫行條例第三條規定之稅率課稅、」至對於上述各項、均未有詳細之規定、如是恐　　今後經營企業者與收稅機關之糾紛必多、竊以爲有條改補訂之必要、請言其理由、</p>

<h3>法幣一週年</h3>
<p>— 馮柳塘</p>
<p>法幣施外，於今一週年矣。此一年中，成效如何，雖幣制改革，不能於短時期內估量其價値，但事實之可得見者，亦足以窺測其一斑，茲從各方面以論法幣一週年之成績。</p>
<p>（一）貿易固然見好轉</p>
<p>原夫法幣之推行，所以統一紙幣之發行，集中銀行之準備，而以保存現銀，不使外流，穩定外滙，不使變動，增加國內資金之流動，調整國際間之貿易。溯自去年十一月四日施用法幣以還，雖其間英美匯價曾有些須變動，但所影響於貿易者甚微。茲將一年間貿易情况，爲表於後。（本文所謂一年間，起自二十四年十月至二十五年九月爲止，因本年十月分之各項數宇，十一月初大都尚未結算齊全。上年同期比較，亦指二十三年十月至二十四年九月而言也。數字以法幣千元爲單位），</p>
<p>以本年立一年間與上年之同期比較，則進口約當年同期白分之九二·五，减百分之七·五。出口約當去年同期百分之一二九，增百分之二九。入超約當上年同期百分之四六·五，减少百分之五三·五。去年之十二月，與本年之一月，又一轉而寫出超，此雖爲歐美時局關係，而與幣制改革，常亦不無影響。若以今年一月至九月之進出口價値，與上年同期比較，計進口價値約當上年同期白分之九五·八，比减四·二。出口貨價約當去年同期百分之一二八，比增二八。入超約當去年百分之五四·六，約减四五·四。然如以關金換算稍有不同。（單位千關金）</p>
<p>則進口比去年同期减一〇二，七五五千關金，出口增三，〇八九千關金，入超减一〇五，八四四千關金。</p>
<p>至便値增减之由來，進口貨中，棉布除本色布外，花色布疋减少甚鉅，因之本市今年各染織廠如有白坯布疋可染，進口旣少，布價又漲，獲利有望。人造絲，砂糖，油蠟類進口之大量减少，諒受冀東方面走私之影響。惟化學製品及染料圖書紙張各項進口之增加若皆用之於工業文化事事業，則不失爲一種好氣象。至出口方面，今年皮革輸出大量擴張，比去年同期增加三分之二，因之皮毛價格大貴，市售幾漲達一倍。此外則大豆及穀類之輸出，亦比往年爲鉅。（穀類進口，去年同期値一二九，二四八，九四六元，本年九個月祇四五，六二六，二九四元，）棉花則自去年同期之五千一百九十一萬八千元，增至今年同期之六千九百八十四萬八千元。桐油等輸出增加三千三百餘萬元，共爲七千四百餘萬元。礦物輸出亦增加七百餘萬元，計爲二千七白十七萬七千元，此外出口諸品，除動物及其製品大爲减少外，無不有相當之增加，惟走私雖經防止，但以流行過廣，歷時太久，今年進口貨價之不如上年，此亦一大原因，而連帶又及於關稅之收人者也。</p>
<p>（二）金銀進出口之估計及海外存金之推測</p>
<p>金銀進出口在此一年間，比之去年同期活動不少，不過去年官商皆可輸送，（黃金亦所不許）本年則非官方不辦矣。計此一年間金銀進出口之狀况如下，（單位法幣千元）</p>
<p>甲　黃金</p>
<p>乙　白銀</p>
<p>查本年黃余輸出，大抵運往英國，白銀則幾全數運往美國，而進口之白銀，則又以來自香港爲多。總之，此兩年間（卽廿三年十月至廿五年九月）黃金出口凈値三千四百十一萬一千元，白銀出口凈値三億五千二百五十萬一千元，爲數不爲不鉅。茲再將去年法幣施行後上海一埠存銀數列左，藉便對照。（兩·元·之單位爲千，條銀之單位爲條）</p>
<p>又據關冊，本年鈔票之移動數量，進口鈔票票面合中國銀元八、四五六、九五〇元，出口亦有四、五八五、四〇〇元，俱不在上述進出口數之內。茲再將此一年間上海存銀之總數於後</p>
<p>據本年十月七日本埠上海日日新聞報載，八月底，上海存銀一億四千萬元，又云九月以來至十月初爲止，運往紐約之銀値五千二百九十萬元，香港銀九千五百零六萬元。合計爲一億四千七百九十六萬元。同時由各地輸人上海者則有厦門十五萬元，九江一百萬元，洛陽五百二十萬元，溫州七萬元，合計六百六十二萬元。並謂上海除日商銀行存有九百萬元外，餘僅存二百二十餘萬元云。其實現在銀準備只要百分之二五，卽在六億一千萬元之現金準備中，僅需二億五千萬元，並當從全國統籌計算，故上海一埠存銀之增减，不足認爲重要。</p>
<p>中國以往金銀進出口情形，記者曾在去年四月中，統計四十六年來金銀進出口數，撰有「中國金銀尚有幾何」一文，載諸第一百三十期本刋。茲將其中各表轉載於後，則於中國金銀，進出數量，更可瞭然矣。</p>
<p>表一　自光緒十五年（銀自十六年）至民國十七年止金銀進出口額凈數表（單位海關兩）</p>
<p>金出超　二〇〇、七六一、九二〇　銀出超　一九四、九三一、六一二</p>
<p>金入超　一〇四、〇〇一、七〇三　銀入超　八一三、一〇九、〇三九</p>
<p>凈出超　九六、七六〇、一二七　凈入超　六　七、一七七、四二七</p>
<p>若以一·五合銀幣，則金之凈出超共値一四五、一四〇、三二五元，銀之凈入超爲九三〇、七六六、一四〇元、兩抵尚爲入超　八五、六二五、八一五元。</p>
<p>表二　自民國十八年起之五年中至二十二年止金銀進出口額凈數表（單位爲國幣）</p>
<p>金出超　二七、五　六、七六〇　銀出超　一九、九五二、二七五</p>
<p>金入超　無　銀入超　三四六、一九二、八二七</p>
<p>凈出超　凈入超　三二六、二　一、五六二</p>
<p>表三　民國二十三年（一九三四年）余銀進出口額凈數表（金以關余計，銀以國幣計算）</p>
<p>金進口　五、八五六　銀進口　四、五七一、五四三</p>
<p>金出口　二六、一二二、二九九　銀出口　二三三、三四五、六八四</p>
<p>出超　二六、二一六、五四三　出超　二二八、七七四、一四一</p>
<p>至我國海外存金有多少，自非吾人所得知。但發鈔銀準備旣减至百分之二五，餘者百分之三五，得以金銀及外滙充之，則六憶一千萬元中之三億五六千萬元，皆不妨移作海外存金。又據本年十月二十日路透社紐約電：謂「美國聯邦儲備銀行撥出値美金　百九十七萬五千元之黃金，劃入外國帳內，衆信此必爲中國出售白銀之結果」，是亦足爲海外存欵之一證也。</p>
<p>（三）銀幣鑄額十九億五千萬元</p>
<p>自上年十　月四日停用硬幣，限民間持有銀幣者掉換法幣，以三個月爲限。嗣又展期三月。期滿仍以邊遠省分恐未掉齊，酌爲延長，至認爲相當時期再行停止。西墨銀圓之流入中國，約在明淸之間，至道允時始盛行，光緒時張之洞在粵督任內，首光設廠鑄造龍紋銀圓，是爲中國有銀圓之始，其後各省仿造，圓政遂敝，民三開鑄袁頭銀幣漸歸劃一。至民國二十二年中央造幣廠開鑄新銀幣，並鑄甲乙兩種廠條，其後僅鑄乙種廠條，每條値銀圓千枚。至去年十一月四日而全廢，惟廠條仍在繼續鼓鑄。本年五月中，中美成立白銀恊定。財長發維護法幣宣言中有鑄五角一元銀幣之說，惟至今尚未開鑄也。</p>
<p>中國自龍紋銀圓至今，自鑄者究有多少，此亦人人所欲知也。根據官書所載加以統計，約如下列之數。</p>
<p>據上表銀元銀條（每條値千元）兩合共爲十九億九千三百五十八萬六千七百三十七元、此可作爲中國自有自鑄銀圓以來之銀幣總數量觀。</p>
<p>（四）法幣施行前後之發鈔狀況</p>
<p>自上年十一月四日財部公告，以「中央，中國，交通三銀行所發之鈔票，定爲法幣，　集中其發行，其他各銀行所發鈔票，仍准流通，但應逐漸收回，而代以中央銀行鈔票，以後各行不得續發新鈔票，所有已印未發之鈔票，應交存中央銀行。」於是中國各銀行發鈔始得集中。在法幣施行前，卽就上海一處除中，中，交三行外，尚有浙江興業等七家，發行鈔票。茲將法幣施行前各銀行發鈔之狀况列表於左（單位千元）</p>
<p>所有各銀行鈔票發行總數，爲四億一千九百五十八萬元，至是均歸發備管理委員會接收。然中國農民銀行仍得中央特許，另行發鈔一億元。再將法幣推行後各銀行鈔票發行額列後：（單位千元）</p>
<p>總計本年十月份三行法幣之發行額爲九億六千一百五十二萬八千元，如以上年同期三行發鈔額作爲百分，則本年十月所得之比率，應爲百分之二二九，五，卽增加一倍又百分之二九，五。若以三行去年十一月之發鈔額與今年十月發行額作爲比較，則其結果如下：（％）</p>
<p>中央　二〇二·六　中國　一六五·四　交通　一七〇·五</p>
<p>以中央鈔票所增爲獨多，有一倍以上，中交增加之速度相近似。農民銀行如以本年九月份發鈔額與去年十月份比較，竟加起百分之三六二，九。據聞其超過限額之數，云謂輔幣劵之發行額，不在一億元限額之內也。</p>
<p>至三行發行準備，就本年十月份言之，均超過法定準備百分之六十以上。</p>
<p>本年五月十七日財政部孔部長又發表維護法幣宣言，其辦法爲</p>
<p>（一）政府爲充分維持法幣信用起見，其現金準備部分，仍以金銀及外匯允之，內白銀準備最低限度應佔發行總額百分之二十五。</p>
<p>（二）政府爲便利商民起見，即鑄造半元一元銀幣，以完成硬幣之種類。</p>
<p>（三）政府爲增進法幣地位之鞏固起見，其現金準備，業已籌得巨欵，將金及外匯充分增加。</p>
<p>可見發鈔現金準備之成分，爲應事實上之需要，已略爲變更矣。</p>
<p>法幣推行，初難統一，蓋兩廣仍用毫洋。及本年八月間廣東統一成功，遂亦改用法幣。廣西有於十一月一日實行之說。</p>
<p>（五）新輔幣應運而生</p>
<p>法幣旣經施行，輔幣亦隨之而改革。由財部規定銀角以十二角銅元以三百枚合法幣一元。每大洋一角作三百文。市上大洋兌價，每元可兌銀角十角四百七八十乃至三百六七十文，每角兌二百四五十文。新輔幣或輔幣券每元兌九角九分，其一分爲兌換商之手續費。在新輔幣未發行前，市上流通有中·中·交·農民·及浙江地方各銀行之一角二角輔幣券，至是仍舊流通，並於本年二月十二日發行半分一分之銅輔幣及五分十分二十分之鎳輔幣。惟以我國幅員廣大，小額輔幣，需要甚鉅。茲就中央銀行一行而言，本年十月分發鈔三萬零五百八十三萬元中，輔幣券佔有三千五百七十五萬元，其他中交農浙諸行尚未計入。但各省政府，常以維持內地物價爲藉口，請發行輔幣券者時有所見，額在二三百萬元間，近聞財部對於印券手續，擬皆由中央統一辦理，以防僞造而資稽考。至新輔幣自本年二月發行以來，至九月止，中央造幣廠之鑄數有如下表（單位萬枚）</p>
<p>如照上列鑄數折合法幣：（單位元）</p>
<p>廿分幣　七，一三〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>十分幣　五，〇五〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>五分幣　二，九二八，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一分幣　一，九八二，四〇〇</p>
<p>半分幣　二一三，二〇〇</p>
<p>合計　一七，三〇三，六〇〇</p>
<p>但仍不够分配，故財部有恢復武昌，西安，安慶三造幣廠鑄造輔幣之擬議。天津方面，曾一度開鑄輔幣，終歸停止。上海市商會請加鑄二厘半銅幣，以便零找，迄未邀准。</p>
<p>輔幣法價之維持，在舊輔幣（銀角銅元）尚未完全收回之前，其如何調節，似應加以深切之注意。惟自規定舊輔幣之兌價以來，上海一埠，　堪維持，然最近之銀角暗盤爲十一角零七分（兌一元），銅圓暗盤爲三百零一千五百文（兌一百元），已有出人矣。浙省又患銅元充斥，頗有無法維持法價之虞，該省商聯會會電請財部救濟。要之均爲新輔幣不够行使，舊輔幣遂難收回，而各銀行之調節似欠努力，以致發生此種現象。故應由各地中·中·交三行隨時照部定平準兌價原案辦理，俾盡推行之實，而利民用也。</p>
<p>（六）幣價更動與物價上升</p>
<p>幣價之更動，其影響之可見者爲物價之升降·溯自法幣施行以來，物價卽見上漲·茲迻載上海躉售物價，輸出入物價，以及華北廣州各批發物價指數於後，以見一斑。</p>
<p>以上各指數均以民國十五年作爲百分　從全國南北中三部之物價指數觀之，自施行法幣之後，物價卽有顯著之增加，如上海躉售物價指數，廿四年十一月分物價，卽比十月分高起九·三，輸出入均各高起九·〇，廣州批發物賈指數高起一〇·三七，華北高起六·六八。嗣遂遂月見增，但趨勢尚平穩，是足見幣價安定之力也。就上海言，輸出物價，除七月分外，猶未及民國十五年之平均價。輸出物品均爲土貨，而其中物價上漲最烈者，厥爲原料品中之農產動物產兩目，生產品與消費品所漲尚微。輸入物價，則以外匯改昂之影響，升漲甚鉅。蓋法幣一枚之新匯價，對英爲一先令二辦士半·而國幣銀圓一枚，重量爲二六·六九七一公分，成色爲八八〇，合純銀爲二三·四九三四四八公分，照當時（法幣施行時）倫敦銀價每盎斯二十九辦士四三七五計算，値二十三辦士四九三七五，今法幣一元祗値十四辦士五，减去九辦士零，貶値約百分之六十五，因之輸入物價指數，卽受影響，自廿四年十月分之一二三·七，急遽高至一四二·七，所漲爲百分之一九，但其後仍上下於一四〇之間，則又見匯價穩定之功。因之英國最近設置對華出口信用貸欵部，以發展對華貿易，在我亦可稍事挹注，不必亟亟於輸送現金也。日本從而傚之，亦將有出口信用貸欵之設置，期與英商角短長，而以我爲推銷商品之市塲則一·惟我建設方殷，所需外資接濟之處亦正多，如所輸入者多爲我建設之材料，用以生利，則亦吾人歡迎之不暇也。</p>
<p>（七）物價升漲與生產增加</p>
<p>物價上漲，可以發展工商業，促進生產之數量。然我國情形特殊，不但爲洋貨銷納之尾閭，且自甲午中日條約之後，洋商將在通商口岸開設工廠，挾其特殊之勢力，地位更優越於華商，四十年來，已成喧賓奪主之勢。故此次法幣施行，我國工業，固受有相當之刺戟，然洋商工廠所受之惠澤尤多。又如本年十月中下旬紗花飛漲，日廠紗綫一包，獲利百元，紗一包獲利四十餘元，且華北紡織業幾爲其囊括以去，猶思加以擴張，瞻念我國工業前途果誠不勝其杞憂也。茲將中央銀行所編中國生產指數列左，以見產業界所受到之福利如何？</p>
<p>（八）急激上漲中之生活費</p>
<p>物價上漲，亦可以增加一般生活上之負担。今年一般生活上之必需品，如豆腐，豆油，猪肉，魚腥，甚至於蔬菜，無一不漲，且所漲幾達一倍。此外粉麥米糧以及布疋呢絨衫襪綫毯煤球白煤橡膠糖果食物一切日用品，俱在陸續上漲中。此固無足奇，躉售物價旣漲，零售物價自亦隨之而漲，故未來之生活問題，茲値得嚴重注意也。茲將（甲）上海生活費指數及（乙）上海工人生活費指數列表於左。</p>
<p>時期　（甲）指數　（乙）指數</p>
<p>廿四年十月　一〇三·九　九七·五四</p>
<p>十一月　一〇九·二　一〇一·四九</p>
<p>十二月　一〇九·三　一〇〇·四六</p>
<p>廿五年</p>
<p>一月　一一一·〇　一〇三·六四</p>
<p>二月　一一二·〇　一〇四·九六</p>
<p>三月　一一四·一　一〇七·一〇</p>
<p>四月　一一一·七　一〇三·九〇</p>
<p>五月　一一一·一　一〇二·六八</p>
<p>六月　一一一·八　一〇二·七四</p>
<p>七月　一一二·二　一〇五·四四</p>
<p>八月　一一五·五　一〇六·七六</p>
<p>九月　一一三·五　一〇四·八二</p>
<p>以上所述，僅及一般，未加論述，已覺其長，不爲本刊篇幅所許。惟法幣旣有此成績，深望更進一步，達到國家預算收支適合之目的，完成生產建設之計劃也。</p>

<p>前於第四屆中央執行委員會第六次全會及第五屆中央執行委員會第二次全會開會時，祥熙曾將截至民國二十四年十一月一日及二十五年七月十日止之政府財政狀况，先後提出報告。茲再將二十三年全會計年度中（自二十三年七月至二十四年六月三十日止）及自該時期以後有關財政之情形，編具一總報告，敬請公察。</p>
<p>查本期中財政上之最堪注目者，厥爲幣制改革。憶自銀價增高，白銀繼續外流，本部爲保存通貨準備，制止匯價提高，及通貨緊縮起見，乃於二十三年十月十四日實行徵收銀出口稅。所有經過情形，祥熙已於上年度財政報告內詳細述及。然此項辦法，雖可恊助完成上列之目的，究非根本解决之善策。蓋匯價雖不若銀價增漲之猛，但仍繼續增高，而國內通貨緊縮之象，亦日甚一日。物價指數在二十四年六月至九月間跌至九〇！九二之量低度。復因匯兌上落不定，商業大受影響，政府至是乃不得不採取幣制上根本之改革。</p>
<p>二十四年十一月三日，政府公布施行法幣命令，規定以中央中國交通三銀行所發行之鈔票作爲法幣。凡執有現銀者，應卽兌換法幣。而爲使法幣對外匯價按照當時價格穩定起見，規定由三行無限制買賣外匯。該計劃內，並包含改組中央銀行爲中央準備銀行，及關於銀行其他之改革，並國家預算收支適合等辦法。</p>
<p>幣制改革目前可謂已達成功期望，國內外輿論亦咸表贊許。上海物價指數在二十四年七月爲九〇·五，至二十五年六月增高至一〇六·一，俱見通貨緊縮之象已被制止，而匯價之穩定更爲從前所未有，國家經濟及普通商業均受益匪淺。自幣制改革以來，法幣在國外之準備，因售銀與美政府，大見增加。而在國內之準備，自二十四年十一月三日起，因發行準備委員會收進二二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元之現銀，亦益增充實。最近西南政局轉好，幣制改革當能推及該地，財政統一至是又進一步矣。</p>
<p>關於造幣，同時亦採取重要改革。新鑄輔幣，鎳質者分二角一角五分三種銅質者分一分半分兩種，均已於本年二月流通使用。中央造幣廠近更加工鑄造上述各種輔幣，以期將原有各種或紙或銅之輔幣早日收回。此外尚擬開鑄一元及五角銀幣，一俟籌備完竣，卽可鑄造發行。</p>
<p>今後革改幣制之需要步驟，爲籌設中央準備銀行，成立後將爲發行法幣之獨一機關，並爲國家唯一之準備庫，俾得對於金融及放欵加以統制，並調劑全國銀行之業務，穩定國幣對外之價値。</p>
<p>本期中預算收支仍感不敷。攷其原因，不外經濟恐慌，幣價不穩，以及國外情形不定，國際貿易銳减，致關稅收入因之短少。東北四省之關鹽各稅，又不能供攤還外債之用。加以華北之走私漏稅，自二十四年秋季始，益形嚴重。雖經繩以嚴律，但在北方之關務官吏，對於享受領事裁判權外國人民之非法行爲，則仍不能執行法令，以致走私更加猖獗。漏稅損失，甚至每週有二百萬元之多。且私貨傾銷，爲害國家經濟及中外正當商人之營業者，更匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>爲抵補上項收入之損失起見，對於稅務行政，遂不得不從事改善，收稅機關，或行改組，或予合併，以期節省開支，改良行政。施行以來，頗著成效，財務行政費業已較前减少。與稅收比較，其比率在二十年爲百分之十一，在二十一及二十二年爲百分之九·九，在二十三及二十四年則爲百分之九。二。</p>
<p>此外若施行合宜之新稅，亦均在研究之中，藉可增加國家收入，及平衡預算收支。所得稅法規，業已擬就，不久卽可頒布施行。遺產稅亦在計畫中。政府施行新稅，其意旨仍以不加重人民擔負及不阻撓農工商業之發展爲標準。</p>
<p>本期支出浩大，實緣振濟水災，復興災區，救濟銀行及工商事業，並資助各省及地方政府以及剿匪等用途。然在此財政困難之時，政府仍勉力增加敎育及建設各經費，並資助各省施行農村復興之政策。至全國經濟委員會之經費，仍繼續撥發，俾興建設，並負治理全國水利之責。政府對各省財政上之改革，亦竭力資助，其顯著者爲四川省。該省財政紊亂不可諱言，乃由政府主持改革幣制，整理債務，廢除各種苛稅，穩定財政。據預計，其二十五至二十六年預算內之收支數額當可相抵。</p>
<p>按上述情形，二十三年度之歲計虧短，自難避免。截至二十四年六月三十日止，其虧短總數約在一萬九千六百萬元。除因救濟銀行認繳股欵七千三百五十萬元外，實短一萬二千二百五十萬元。茲據臨時訐算，二十四年度歲計虧短之數不幸將較上年爲尤鉅。</p>
<p>二十五年正月，政府與公債持券人會協議整理內債，商定辦法，發行統一公債，計分五種，總値十四萬六千萬元，分別換償從前發行之三十三種公債。其修改要點，爲延長償還期限。按此辦法，每年債務費可减少八千五百萬元。同時又發行復興公債三萬四千萬元，以爲鞏固國家財政及彌補歲虧之用。</p>
<p>在本時期內，對於各種積欠債務之整理，尤爲積極。二十五年二月，對於由鐵路及關稅收入擔保之一九〇八年——十年津浦鐵路借欵宣告整理。此外尚有其他鐵路借欵，亦在整理之列。政府希望能繼續整理其他債務。更鑒於國有鐵路之整理，與財政之建設及國家信用之恢復，關係恭切，復經財政部會同鐵道部，辦理關於復興鐵路及整理舊債各事件。於二十四年春，聘請富於鐵路行政經騐之外國工稈師，來華研究我國鐵路情形。其所具意見，頗多可採，對於我國鐵路之改進，貢獻殊多。</p>
<p>以上爲關於金融財政之一般情形。茲再就財部主管各事務，分別報告於後。</p>
<h3>中央政府收支</h3>
<p>下列收支表係依據財政部會計司在二十三年會計年度所收得之各方報告編列而成。該年度卽截至二十四年六月底爲止，有若干欵項，其收支雖在該年度七月一日以前，但其報告係在七月一日以後收到者，均已列入表內。至在該年度六月三十日以前之收支欵項，而其報告在該時期以後尚未收到者，則未列入表中。</p>
<h3>二十三年度中央收支報告</h3>
<p>（收入之部）</p>
<h3>二十三年度中央收支報告表</h3>
<p>（支出之部）</p>
<h3>關務</h3>
<p>修訂海關進口稅則，係於二十三年七月起開始施行。此新稅則一而减輕類疋頭及若干項他種貨物之稅，一面增高五金機器及化學等品之稅。上項物品，稅率雖增，但以其銷塲不受嚴重影響爲原則。蓋修正稅率之目的，原爲增加稅收及保障國內之生產與製造業也。出口稅率，於二十三年六月，亦曾一度修正，各貨稅率大都减輕。但因國庫支絀，及其他財政困難，在二十四年至二十五年之期中，政府卒不得實施其所預定之减輕出口稅及裁撤轉口稅之計劃。在上年度報告中，曾言自二十二年四月六日起，對各式白銀之出口，徵收百分之二·二五之從價稅，惟銀圓及廠條之出口，則並不徵稅。自二十三年十月起對於銀圓及廠條，亦徵收百分之七·七五之出口稅，並施行百分之十之其他出口銀稅，外加出口平衡稅，以補足倫敦銀價及官定匯價之差額。以上各種自衛辦法，係防止自國白銀因外國市塲銀價高漲而流出。現白銀走私已告停止，緣外國銀價近已低落也。</p>
<p>關於進出口貨之附加稅（其稅率各爲進出口稅之百分之五），在本時期內，賑災部份照舊征收，其補助財政部份，自二十五年七月起，更展期一年。海關緝私本年重加整頓。緝私巡艦大小有七十五艘，頗足防制普通沿海及邊境之走私。但自二十四年秋季起，因海關巡艦在河北省東部受武力之抵抗，並被繳械，大受挫　．北方走私之貨雲集，無法制止。一星期間稅收之損失約在二百萬圓左右。現在惟有在鐵路沿綫設緝私站，以防私貨侵入。</p>
<p>茲將自民國元年起至二十四年止海關收入總數按年列表如左：</p>
<p>年份　稅收總數（連船鈔在內）</p>
<p>民國元年　六六，七四三，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國二年　七三，〇六九，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國三年　六五，九一四，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國四年　六三，一四九，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國五年　六四，六七四，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國六年　六五，三八一，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國七年　六二，八一七，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國八年　七八，六八四，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國九年　八四，四五一，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十年　九一，八九九，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十一年　九八，〇七九，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十二年　一〇五，九三五，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十三年　一一五，〇五二，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十四年　一一六，二二四，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十五年　一二八，七三三，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十六年　一一二，九八五，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十七年　一三三，九四〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十八年　二四五，二二六，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國十九年　二九一，六九七，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國二十年　三八六，九一二，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國廿一年　二八七，八八八，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國廿二年　三一一，二六〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國廿三年　三〇六，一八六，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>民國廿四年　二八八，四二五，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>至在最近三年中各項關稅之總收入，包括上表未列之賑災及其他附加稅在內，則有如下表：</p>
<p>在觀察以上稅收數額之情形時，不得不注意以下各點：</p>
<p>（一）民國二十年常關停辦。</p>
<p>（二）民國二十年一月，釐金，復進口稅，及內地子口稅撤消。</p>
<p>（三）民國二十一年中，東三省及大連之海關被佔據。</p>
<p>二十四年之進口稅收，比較二十三年增加四百八十八萬關金。惟因是年銀價之高，致銀元實收减少一千零五萬元。自二十四年十一月改革幣制以來，關金兌價增高，故銀元實收亦因而增加。二十四年關金收入之高，係因二十三年新進口稅則一部分稅率增高之故，蓋是年進口貨尚較前减少百分之十也。在另一方面，出口稅收，雖以稅率之低降而减少，但出口貨則較二十三年增多百分之七·六。根據目前情形，及國幣匯兌率之低落，本年出口貨似更有增加之希望。</p>
<h3>鹽務</h3>
<p>在本報告所及之期中，鹽務行政循序進步，收入增加。其改良各點，尤以緝私與鹽塲管理爲重要。惟土鹽之生產滋長，影響官銷甚鉅。數年前祗有六縣產生士鹽，嗣據調查竟有一百五十八縣之多。若任使土鹽暢銷，則鹽稅收入將大受影饗。河北河南山東各省，每年稅收勢將减少數百萬之鉅。爲使官銷能與土私競爭起見，已將鹽稅逐漸减低，同時進行灌溉工作，改良土壤，俾產生土鹽區域得以恢復種植。在河北省則徵收整理費，專充此項工作之用，在河南省則自二十三年七月起，每月撥欵三萬元。同時並舉，截至二十三年底止，在河北一省用各種取締方法，十鹽鍋池之被剷除者約有三十萬座。在河南省內則多濬河道，俾利種植。已開之河渠，已達三百四十四公里。是項工作仍在繼續進行。</p>
<p>鹽塲管理工作亦繼續發展，除建築鹽倉外，鹽塲管理制度日見進步。如長蘆淮北及山東各地，皆有圍塲公路稅警所及電話等之設備，以利緝私。</p>
<p>統一鹽務行政，在本年內益見進展。四川之鹽務行政及緝私機關，均於二十四年四月收歸鹽務稽核所管理。硝磺自二十二年由鹽務機關經營以來，銷路亦日見起色。</p>
<p>外債攤額，除東北三省外，全國所屬各鹽務稽核所均按期匯解。四川各鹽務機關，自二十四年五月起，亦復繼續匯解。是故以鹽稅爲擔保之借欵本息，均能如期撥付，信用日益穩固。一九〇八年英法借欵之積欠，於二十三年十月付淸。一九一二年克利斯浦借欵本金積欠之一部份，亦在開始償付。</p>
<p>關於鹽稅收入，在過去一年內，雖銀根奇緊，各區感受水災，而二十四年之收入，比較二十三年竟增加八百二十五萬九千元。茲將鹽務稽核總所自民國二年起至二十四年止之歲入，列表如左：</p>
<p>（關如東北鹽稅被扣留後之影響參觀二十一及二十二年度財政報告第十頁）</p>
<p>年份　總收入</p>
<p>二年　一九，〇四四，二〇〇元</p>

<h3>稅務</h3>
<p>徵收統稅之物品，現有捲菸棉紗麥粉火柴水泥薰菸啤酒鑛產火酒等九種。火酒前歸普通酒類徵稅。自二十四年一月一日起，改辦統稅，並妥訂稅率，期使火酒事業發展，俾稅收得以增加。至於汽水之徵稅，現亦正在計畫改辦統稅。自薰菸葉改辦統稅以來，稅收激增。惜因產菸區域，管理尚未嚴密，私運私銷，所在多有，以致各該地手工私製捲菸盛行，難於查緝，妨害正當商人營業，影響國家稅收甚鉅。爲謀根本整理起見，已擬具菸葉統制辦法，使政府統制菸葉之分配，呈經行政院令准照辦，正在着手籌備進行。至原有各稅之整理，亦在繼續進行，如年來外洋私製冒牌漏稅進口火柴，充斥市面，爲杜絕走私計，發於二十五年度內改行火柴按包貼花，以期便利查緝。至川湘兩省鑛稅，經與兩省政府商洽，已收回由財政部直接徵收。</p>
<p>又土酒產銷，零星散漫，各省稅率不一，雖迭經整頓，仍未能澈底改革。茲擬先就產多銷廣之江蘇燒酒，浙江紹酒，山西汾酒，尅期取銷現行複雜稅率，改辦一道徵收，以期統一，同時對於其他已經着手改良之計畫，再加奮勉，逐漸推進，以求盡善。</p>
<p>稅務行政，向對各種稅收，分設機關專管，難收澈底整理之效。現自二十五年度起，已决定將同一區域內所在統稅鑛稅及烟酒稅各機關，分別裁併改組。將全國各省市，劃分爲若干區，各設一區稅務局，爲督征機關。其下分設稅務管理所稅務分所，專司稽征事務。但爲逐漸實施起見，自二十五年十月一日起，先於豫贛湘鄂川五省，先行試辦。其餘未行改組各省，則仍由稅務署　令切實整理，並派遣督察稽查，至改良辦法，自當體察情形，隨時推行，以期統一。</p>
<h3>地方財政</h3>
<p>憶自二十三年五月間召集第二次全國財政會議，决議整理地方財政方案；對於廢除苛捐雜稅，减輕田賦附加，舉辦士地陳報，確定地方預算諸項，兩年以來，已逐漸獲有成效，頗堪欣慰。此不獨由於本部之努力督促，亦由於各省市當局之誠意合作也。</p>
<p>最近各省財政狀况，均有顯著之進步，尤以蘇皖湘鄂贛豫魯陝川爲最。中央視其力之所及，對於各省財政之整理，預算之平衡，歷經實施恊濟。同時對於各省農村之建設，更予以儘量之輔助。各省整理財政，其成效最著者，當推川省。當中央進軍剿除共匪時，川省財政混亂非常。嗣後政局漸臻平定，財政改革卽隨而進行。本部對於該省幣制之統一，舊債之整理，不遺餘力。乃相繼發行川省金融整理庫券三千萬元，及善後公債七千萬元。至川省二十五年度預算業經中央核准，可求收支平衡矣。</p>
<p>各省市已將二十四年度槪算送部者計有十七省四市（註一）。其已將二十五年度槪算送部者計九省一市（註二）。縣政府已將二十四年度槪算送部者不下一千零五十九縣（註三）。</p>
<p>截至本報告編造之日爲止，各省市裁撤苛捐雜稅及减輕田賦附加總數已達五千一百萬元。至於整頓田賦各區，業已舉辦土地陳報者，爲數頗多，此後當益有進步之可能。</p>
<p>（註一）安徽察哈爾浙江靑海福建河南河北湖南湖北甘肅江西江蘇貴州山東陝西南京北平靑島寗夏威海衛綏陽。</p>
<p>（註二）安徽察哈爾福建河南湖南湖北甘肅江蘇寗夏威海衛。</p>
<p>（註三）安徽六一，察哈爾一五，浙江七五，福建六二，河南一一一，湖南五七，湖北七〇，甘肅六七，江西八三，江蘇六〇，廣西八四，貴州五四，寗夏一〇，山東一〇八，陝西九二，雲南五〇。</p>
<h3>債務</h3>
<p>自二十三年七月一日以後，除於二十五年初發行之統一公債及復興公債外，其由財政部發行之公債有下列數種：</p>
<p>發行日期　名稱　數額</p>
<p>二十四年四月一日　金融公債　一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十四年六月三十日　關稅公債　一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十四年七月一日　四川善後公債　七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十四年八月一日　整理四川金融庫券　三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十四年十一月一日　水災工賑公債　二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十五年四月一日　四川善後公債　一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>總共三三五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>此外尚有鐵路建設公債一萬二千萬元，由鐵道財政兩部會同發行，用備興築連接湘黔川桂各省之鐵道，並展長平綏正太兩路路錢之用。該公債本年五月先發總額三分之一。其本息墓金，除以新築及展長各路之收入及國有其他各鐵路償還原有債務之餘欵撥充外，另由財部補助之。</p>
<p>在本期內，對於公債最著之改革，厥爲內債之統一。其辦法經政府與持券人會雙方商定，於本年二月一日實行。此項辦法，不僅變更公債之組織，並使其種類亦化爲簡單。卽以五種統一公債，總値十四萬六千萬元，換償以前發行之三十三種公債。利息雖仍舊以六厘計算，惟償還期限則延長爲自十二年至二十四年。以前發行各種公債，償還期限大都較近，其中約有百分之七十，應於六年之內償淸。故此統一之辦法，較之從前之規定，每年債務費上約可减少八千五百萬元，對於平衡預算收支，獲益匪鮮。</p>
<p>統一辦法，包括所有前發之內國公債，庫券，及國民政府所發行之各券證，惟下開各種除外；</p>
<p>（一）短期善後公債。該債係於二十五年三月滿期。（二）十七年金融長期公債。該債年息二厘半，至民國四十二年滿期。（三）海河公債。（四）二十四年四川善後公債。第（三）及（四）兩種公債，雖由中央發行，但共基金，均以地方收入爲担保，性屬地方借欵。上開四種公債之數額，僅居統一公償總額百分之八。</p>
<p>至舊有之公債，則依其償還期限，別爲五類，以便分換各種統一公債。其調換券據手續，已於本年六月三十日完結。</p>
<p>發行六厘復興公債三萬四千萬元，亦爲統一辦法中之一部。藉可鞏固財政地位，以資建設之需要而補預算之虧短，此項公債，擬在一年或兩年內陸續發行。</p>
<p>二十年及二十二年物品借欵之展期償還　本年五月二十八日政府徵得美當局之同意，簽訂合同，將一九三一年水災救濟借欵與一九三三年棉麥借欵，合併爲一項借欵，計美金一六，六〇八，三二九，九九元，並延長其償還期限。水災借欵，計有美麥及麪粉共四十五萬噸，原値美金九，二一二，八二六，五</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>六元，以供救济民国二十年长江水災及災區建設之用，其三分之二，即美金六，一四一，八八四，三六元，業已還濟。所馀美金三，〇七〇，九四二，二〇元，應於本年十二月三十一日歸還。至棉麥借欵計美金一七，〇八六，二八二，四八元，其中美金三，五四八，八九四，六九元，已於本年五月二十八日前付還。全部用於一切建設復興等事宜。此項借欵，原定於三年內償淸，惟在一九三三年簽訂合同時，雙方曾有展延二年之建議。上列兩項借欵之還本，依照原訂合同，應於二十五年度歸還美金八，六三〇，〇〇〇元，二十六年度歸還美金八，四二一，〇〇〇元，政府以改革幣制正在施行，希將外償之負担暫予减輕，故商請展長償還期限，幸獲美當局之贊助重訂還本表如：</p>
<p>二十五年　（一九三六年）　美金　一，三五一，〇〇七元</p>
<p>二十六年　（一九三七年）　美金　二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十七年　（一九三八年）　美金　二，五〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十八年　（一九三九年）　美金　二，八〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十九年　（一九四〇年）　美金　二，八〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>三十年　（一九四一年）　美金　二，八〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>三十一年　（一九四二年）　美金　二，八〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>共計　美金一七，〇五一，〇〇七元</p>
<p>政府依本年五月二十八日所簽訂之合同，得於近年中减輕還本數額，在財政上獲益殊非淺鮮。</p>
<p>整理舊欠一九〇八年至一九一〇年間，所簽訂津浦鐵路借欵之舊欠懸案，經長期之磋商，得於本年二月二十五日宣告解央。該項借欵合同內雖以津浦鐵收入爲第一擔保，但更載有得以關稅爲擔保之規定，故政府在此次整理時，亦以關稅收入爲該借欵利息之擔保，以昭信譽。</p>
<p>同時其他鐵路借欵之舊欠，業經整理者爲數亦不少。其最著者有平漢路，南潯路，及豫省鐵路等借欵。</p>
<p>政府對此綜錯複雜之舊欠問題，仍繼續注意，深冀能於最短期內，將其他舊欠亦一併整理完竣。</p>
<p>最近政府主要外債之價格，在國外市塲上，日見高漲，反映政府整理國債信用之政策，已收實效，良可欣慰也。</p>
<h3>中央銀行</h3>
<p>在本期中，中央銀行之發展，日新月異，但觀下表所列，卽可知之。</p>
<p>中央銀行在本時期內除繼續對政府供給國內外種種所需之便利外，更能積極執行中央銀行之職務。會金融界風潮迭起，社會經濟，元臬不安，該行得中交二行之密切合作，倡導救急辦法，對商業銀行力加援助。又自二十三年十月現銀出口實行取締以來，該行對於穩定外匯行市，始終努力進行，成效甚著。</p>
<p>自二十四年十一月三日施行法幣政策，政府對於全國法幣流通數額，以及國內銀行放欵事業，亟應加以統制，以求新貨幣制度之安定。蓋當銀本位時代，現銀之輸出或輸入，恒有調劑市面之效用，使吾國對內對外之經濟狀况，臻於平衡。但今茲情異勢遷，欲求金融調劑得宜，非由負責施行貨幣政策之當局，隨時嚴密注意與籌維不爲功。</p>
<p>二十四年十一月三日宣佈新貨幣政策原文有云；「現爲國有之中央銀行，將來應行改組爲中央準備銀行，其主要資本，應由各銀行及公衆供給，俾成爲超然機關，而克以全力保持全國貨幣之穩定。中央準備銀行應保管各銀行之準備金，經理國庫，並收存一切公共資金，且供給各銀行以再貼現之便利。中央準備銀行並不經營普通商業銀行之業務，惟於二年後享有發行專權。」</p>
<p>本年二月祥熙曾向行政院建議，擬將中央銀行官股讓出百分之六十爲商股，以應社會需要，而示與民共有。同時並組織一專門委員會，專司計畫改組該行爲中央準備銀行。該會業經透切研究，呈具報告，現正由政府當局詳加考慮。該新銀行之早觀厥成，實祥熙所切望者也。</p>
<h3>中央銀行</h3>
<h3>錢幣</h3>
<p>揆衡近代國家需要，適應我國特殊之經濟狀况，以實現統一健全之幣制，人爲政府貨幣政策之鵠的，十七年中央銀行之剏設，十八年中央造幣廠之開辦，二十二年之廢兩改元與改革錢幣之籌措，與夫去年十一月二日新幣制之實施，皆完成貨幣政策之步驟也。</p>
<p>二十三年十月實施征收白銀出口棁，藉以制此白銀外流，及防此外匯隨國外銀價而升降，已於上屆報告詳述矣。苟非如是，則賴以維持幣制之存銀，恐早有罄盡之虞。物價慘落，將不堪設想。鑒諸香港，以到白銀出口初無限制，以致躉售物價指數，在二十四年八月跌至六九·四，而同月上海躉售物價指數，僅降至九三·二，（俱以十一年平均數為一〇〇）益見征收銀出口稅關係之重要。惟此種舉措，雖能奏效於一時，究非根本安定金融之策。誠以施行以來，輸送白銀之風未戢，外匯續見上騰，通貨益加緊縮，國內銀價仍受國外銀市之波動。如以近三年每月平均英匯美匯行市與按倫敦銀價計算之平價相較，而計算市價與平價之差額，則有如下表：</p>
<p>（註一）二十四年十一月三日以前各數係根據遠期市價以後係採用近期市價</p>
<p>征收白銀出口稅辦法公佈後，匯價略縮，惟不久卽復回漲。至二十四年春，續漲至一元合美金四角二分·英金二〇·五辨士。而在二十三年十月上半月之最高價，則爲美金三角八分與英金一八·五辨士。匯率續漲之原因，的有數端。我國外匯受國外銀價之波動，由來已久，非短期間可能脫離連繫。白銀終是白銀，國外銀價上漲，勢必隨之而漲，非禁止輸出所能抑止。通貨續見緊縮，上海躉售物價指數，在二十四年二月爲九九·九，至同年七月，已降至九〇·五，况國外銀價較國內銀價高百分之十五至百分之六十五不等，私運之利奇厚，以我國邊境之遼闊，再加治外法權與租界之障礙，故防範甚不易收效。隨白銀外流而生之徵象，爲金融之極端枯緊。其影饗更足以提高外匯，抑低物價。二十四年二月間廢歷新年結算後，銀拆雖略見低落，顧不足以爲銀根寬裕之證，實由當時市面枯竭無欵可貸也。其延滯建設之進行與妨礙政府財政之籌措至深且鉅。</p>
<p>當時吾國經濟危殆之徵象，日見顯着，債票價格慘落，地產下跌，中外商號資力之薄弱者先後倒閉，共勉强維持者，實力亦大見消弱，以致倒閉與失業日趨嚴重與蔓延。此種狀况，在二十四年春秋兩季間爲最嚴重。在此期中，政府得中央中國交通之合作，措籌救濟辦法，復撥庫券二千五百萬元貸與各業，以濟眉睫之急，國家經濟破產之患，得以倖免。</p>
<p>政府舉措之最重要者，莫如改組中交兩行，增加政府資本，俾於救濟工商改革幣制之設施上，得與中央銀行通力合作，藉收事半功倍之效，查中國銀行經增加官股爲一千五百萬元後，資本總額爲四千萬元，百分之五十爲官股。交通銀行經增加官股一千萬元後，資本總額爲二千萬元，百分之六十爲官股。</p>
<p>在二十四年之初期，政府深知澈底改革幣制，爲穩定金融之唯一途徑。防通貨之緊縮，拯吾國於經濟恐慌之漩渦，唯此是賴，故卽准行規劃改革方案。迨乎十月間，情勢益趨險惡，政府乃於十一月三日，毅然實施新幣制政策，公佈施行法幣辦法。規定：（一）穩定外匯，約以當時外匯市價爲標準；（二）中央中國交通三銀行發行之鈔票，定爲法幣，並集中發行；（三）白銀國有；（四）改組中央銀行爲中央準備銀行，俾成超然機關；（五）健全商業銀行制度，設法增加其活動能力；（六）整理財政，使國家預算再歷十八閱月能收支適合。（實施新貨幣政策之宣言及通告附錄於後）</p>
<p>新幣制法案公佈之翌日，英國大使通令該國僑華商民一體遵守，並禁止使用現銀淸償債務，違者視爲犯罪行爲。</p>
<p>政府復以我國舊有輔幣至爲複雜，乃公佈輔幣條例，並飭中央造幣廠鼓鑄二十分十分五分一分半分之輔幣，於本年二月十日發行。又爲便利商民起見，將鑄造半元一元銀幣，以完成硬幣之種類，茲將本年上半年中央造幣廠鑄造輔幣數目列表如下：</p>
<p>種類　枚數　面值</p>
<p>二十分鎳幣　一一，六一八，五四四　二，三二三，七〇八·八〇元</p>
<p>十分鎳幣　一八，一八三，六六八　一，八一八，三六六·八〇元</p>
<p>五分鎳幣　五〇，七三七，二〇二　二，五三六，八六〇·一〇元</p>
<p>一分銅幣　一一九，九八〇，〇〇〇　一，一九九，八〇〇·〇〇元（註）</p>
<p>半分銅幣　四一，一六〇，〇〇〇　二〇五，八〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>共計　二四一，六七九，四一一　八，〇八四，五三五·七〇元</p>
<p>（註）包括二十四年十二月鑄造之三，一〇〇，〇〇〇枝（值三一，〇〇〇元）在內</p>
<p>顧我國內，雜幣流通各地，勢須逐漸收回，所需新輔幣之數量自必甚鉅，欲新舊全部替換，恐非數年小可也。</p>
<p>政府改革金融之措施，已奏良效，現在努力推行，以竟全功。自法幣案公布之後，本部設立發行準備管理委員會於上海，並核准於天津·漢口·廣州·西安·濟南·長沙·靑島等處，設立分會，專任保管法幣發行準備金，同時負責辦理法幣之發行收換事宜。關於法幣兌換事項，復經本部制定兌換法幣辦法及銀製品用銀管理規則，進行尚稱順利。又爲防止不正當之投機及逾分之物價上漲，於各處設立安定物價委員會以取締之。</p>
<p>新幣制之施行，已秦膚功。上海市　售物價指數，二十四年七月為九〇·五，在十月爲九四·一，在十月爲一一〇三·三，在二十五年六月爲一〇六·一，本年廢歷年關，各業安然渡過，市上並無任何之騷擾。本年上半年出口貿易，較去年同期的增四分之一。關稅收入，初呈增加之現象，迨受華北走私猖獗之影響，始略見减少。</p>
<p>自新幣制法施行以來，全國資力更見集中。外匯極稱穩定。截至本年六月底止，發行準備管理委員，除保管中央中國交通三行原有白銀外，計收集白銀二萬二千五百萬元。二十四年十一月間，我國政府與美政府訂的售白銀五千萬盎斯，每盎斯價爲美金六角五分，於去年十二月間運美。今歲五月間，又有第二批白銀售與美國。此項舉措，乃爲調節外匯，穩定匯價。以固世人對新幣制之信仰。美國對我國新幣制之贊助，豈獨利吾國人，其裨益外人之與我共貿易者亦良多也。</p>
<p>本年五月爲謀增厚法幣保障計，復由本部規定法幣現金準備，仍以金銀及外匯充之，內白銀準備量低限度，佔發行總額百分之二十五·同時本部公布撤銷銀製品用銀限制。（宣言及部令附錄於後）自新幣制施行以來，中中交三行發行總額，由四二七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元增加至八五六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元（本年六月二十七日核計數）計增發四二九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。內用以兌回以前其他發行銀行之鈔票者，計一三九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，其餘二九〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇無，則以兌回之白銀一七二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，及金與外匯暨由市塲收回之債票爲準備。茲將截至本年六月底止，吾國之發行總額列表如下：</p>
<p>中·中·交三銀行發行總額八五六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>其他各行　一六五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>（農民銀行　七一，九一二，〇〇〇元）</p>
<p>（以前銀行未況回者九三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元）</p>
<p>合計　一，〇二一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>中央對各省幣政之整理，不遣馀力，如川省原有雜幣，流通至爲紛亂，經整理後，皆以中·中·交三行鈔票收回。西南亦籌改大洋制，全國幣制統一，</p>
<p>綜觀我國在過去年度中對於安定金融之措施，已有顯著之進展，基礎旣固，苟無國際風雲變化之阻撓，國民經濟，當可日趨繁榮焉。</p>
<p>預算</p>
<p>二十四年度現甫終了，决算尚須時日，茲姑就十九年度以來，五年度收支槪况，根據本部會計司之報告列表如左，以資比較（註一）：</p>
<p>二十三年度虧知之數爲一九六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。內有七三，五〇〇，〇〇〇元係撥充銀行官股，以救濟該年度內金融機關之恐慌。故歲計虧短實數爲一二二，五〇〇，〇〇〇元（註二）</p>
<p>註一：本表所列數字與本部以前之財政報告所列者略有差別，因會計司現已改照主計處計算辦法，以本部主管各稅徵收費作爲撥與本部支出，而不由稅欵收人內坐撥。</p>
<p>註二：虧短凈數之計算</p>
<p>支出總數　九四〇，九二八，四五六·一一</p>
<p>收入總數　七四四，九二二，〇四二·二〇</p>
<p>虧短總數　一九六，〇〇六，四一三·九一</p>
<p>投資總數　七三，五〇〇，〇〇〇·〇〇</p>
<p>虧短凈數　一二二，五〇六，四一三·九一</p>
<p>上列各年度虧短數目大部份可與償還債務支出相抵。茲將歷年償還債務支出，與各年度歲計虧短，列於下表（以百萬元爲單位）：</p>
<p>會計年度　償還債務數　虧短之數</p>
<p>十九年度　一五〇　二一七</p>
<p>二十年度　一六〇　一三〇</p>
<p>廿一年度　一〇〇　八六</p>
<p>廿二年度　一一五　一四七</p>
<p>廿三年度　一二五　一九六</p>
<p>共計　六五〇　七七六</p>
<p>每年償還庚欵之欵，除擔保債務費外，槪未列入上表。歷年政府借貨，大半用於償還舊債。惟所發之新債券，因係照票面貶價發行，實際上利息奇重，而國家稅收之經指定爲新債之擔保者，亦日見加多。</p>
<p>二十四年歲計虧短，較前年度爲允鉅。其增加原因的有數端：（一）在過去一年間，華北大規模之走私，國際間糾紛之頻仍，人民購買力之削弱，均足以减削進口之數量，以致關稅收入銳减；（二）江河泛濫，災情嚴重，修堵救濟，支出激增；（三）經濟不景氣愈益深刻，救濟銀錢業及工商各界所費亦鉅；（四）補助各省與地方政府所費仍鉅；（五）共匪侵擾西北與西南，勦滅不容稍緩；國防建設乃存亡所繫，允不能不盡力措置也。</p>
<p>歷年歲出以軍務費與債務費爲大宗，於左表可槪見之：</p>
<p>註四此數一部份係前一年度內支付之數，計二十年度支四九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，廿一年度支五九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，廿二年度支四六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，廿三年度支五八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>敎育費及建設費數年來國庫財力雖以應付種種意外事件以及共他用途而日形枯竭，但本部關懷敎育及建設等事業之進展仍未稍减，蓋本部深信欲求稅收之增加，非先提高入民生產力，改進共日常生活不可。幸經本部努力籌維，近年內敎育及建設欵項之支出，包括公路鐵路水利公共衛生農村救濟等費用，反見增加，此亦足堪欣慰者也。</p>
<p>上表所列數字，係包括救災費在內。由擔付各省之補助費則並一未計人。按各省補助費，其大部份係充補助各地敎育之發展，經濟建設之實施，及廢除苛捐雜稅等事宜。其數目亦頗可觀，計廿二年度爲國幣三二，〇〇一，三三二·八一元，廿三年度爲五五，四八八，〇七二·四二元，而廿四年度該兩項敎育及建設費益見增加。</p>
<p>廿五年度國家預算業經頒布，茲將廿四廿五兩年度歲入歲出預算數目分列如左，以資比較：</p>
<p>在過去之七八年間，政府對於闢養稅源不遺餘力，如關稅稅則之修訂，鹽務之整理改進，統稅制度之創辦，皆著成效。各項稅收之進展，可見下表：</p>
<p>歷年稅欵增收，一部份雖由於各地之國稅漸歸本部直接徵收，然所需徵收經費，因以隨增。且民十八年以來，內亂屢起，共禍蔓延，勦撫之費甚鉅。益以連年災患，防堵救濟在在需欵。民二十年長江水災賑費逾七千萬元，財產損失估計二十萬萬元，其影響國家稅收者至大‘自東北淪喪，稅收隨之而失，致以該四省關鹽担保各外債之協欵，未能解撥。且東北與內地各省商業尚稱暢旺，至此亦因之阻滯，使政府稅收與工商業受絕大打擊。近兩三年來，因種種不景氣影響，不獨稅收未能加增，而臨時支出救濟等費，反因之而激增矣。</p>
<h3>結論</h3>
<p>溯自民國二十二年以來，我國在財政上所遭貧困之境遇，於近代史中得未曾有。蓋以天災頻仍，共禍猖獗，而救災剿匪，動需鉅欵。兼以世界經濟不景氣之襲擊，使我國倍受摧殘。復因歷年之舊欠，致財政較前更形困難。然本部雖處於如此萬難中，猶能增撥的欵，促進建設，其最著者如敎育·公路·鐵道·水利·公共衛生·農村救濟，以及其他生產等事業。此外又能盡力整理舊欠，以維國債之信用。至全國金融組織，幸經政府採用最適當之步驟，從容應變，復得人民一致協助，始能免於崩潰，而轉臻穩固矣。且　業金融，現已漸呈蓬勃之象，一俟完全恢復，其前途當未可限量也。</p>
<p>政府在財政上之改革，經濟上之建設，現已决第實施，設無外患之牽制，當可有更顯著之進展。况西南問題，近日亦已全部解决，故財政統一，更無問題矣。</p>
<p>政府爲求更進一步之進展起見？在財政上，須以下列原則爲張本。</p>
<p>（一）凡屬不需要或不生產之開支，應一律撙節，餘欵以供生產及建設上之用途。</p>
<p>（二）甄別及訓練稅收人員，藉資增加行政效率。</p>
<p>（三）整理現行稅收，開征良好新稅，以達增加稅收而不增加人民負担之目的。</p>
<p>（四）改革地方稅收，使其與國家稅收相符。</p>
<p>（五）改良銀行制度，並促進農村信用制度，俾農村經濟易於恢復。</p>
<p>（六）完成幣制之統一，維持國幣匯價之穩定，藉以穩定金融情勢。</p>
<p>（七）淸理舊欠，以維國債信用。</p>
<p>近數年中，政府迫於環境，注全力以應急需。但此後則將傾向於經濟建設一途。惟欲達此目的，須設立一更有效之預算制度，以資控制各項用途。然政府在財政上所渴望者，不僅收支相抵而已，且冀財政日冀健全，傳有餘力以開發國內經濟資源，並改進人民之生活也。</p>
<p>所有民國二十三年會計年度及該期以後之財政狀况，臚陳如右　敬祈</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （閻重樓）</p>
<p>如果我們想到世界上有一種最眞實而又最虛空的東西，那就是靈魂。</p>
<p>靈魂不能用手觸，也不能用目視，然而它却是那樣凝固的，潛伏在每一個人的體中。</p>
<p>人若失去了靈魂，無疑的，那就成爲一種行尸走肉，痛苦加於它而不覺！侮辱加於它而不怒！那也便失去了生存的意義。</p>
<p>靈魂和容貌一樣，有美醜的分別，也有善惡的分別；美善的靈魂就像那快樂的種子，常常能給人世一種幸福。醜惡的靈魂就像那蓄意的禍根，常常能給人世一種破壞。可惜在現在，美善的靈魂實在太少了！</p>
<p>靈魂因爲是人自己的東西，所以人可以隨意支配它，有些人竟不顧靈魂是自己唯一的僅有的東西，而忍心地把它出賣！這稱行爲更是太不幸，—太可憐了。</p>
<p>在今日，我們不能失去了我們的靈魂，做一種無知覺的行尸走肉。我們也不能出賣我們的靈魂，造成那可憐的行徑。我們應該堅抗那醜惡的靈魂，培養我們美善的靈魂。</p>
<h3>閘北的八字橋</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>閘北的八字橋，在一二八以前，除了鄰近的居戶知道以外，恐怕連熟悉途徑的人力車夫也找不到。實在這裏荒僻得可以，沒有熱鬧的店舖，沒有殷實的居戶，有誰來注意到呢？一二八戰事一起，十九路軍沿着橋西佈防：日軍從橋東進攻，兩方戰爭之劇烈，不亞於江灣及火車站，屢失屢得，爲此彈丸之地，不知犧牲了幾多生命，因此這八字橋三字，滿載於報紙，喧騰於衆口了。所以眞實地說一聲：「八字橋的得名，是以鮮紅的熱血換來的。」</p>
<p>這小小的八字橋，爲甚麽兩軍拚死的爭奪呢？因爲照地勢上講。這實是閘北沿東的咽喉。因爲閘北有一條很長的沙涇港，北起江灣，東迄黃浦，在閘北的區域內，兩軍便隔着這河而對峙着。那八字橋的南端，便是橫浜路，日軍的進攻，便沿着這路開始。倘使這橋一衝過，那末北火車站和江灣的連絡綫，頓時截斷；而閘北的熱鬧區域，也立刻有被佔據之可能。因此攻方旣注意於此；而守的也不敢懈怠，於是便造成屢决的劇烈和恐怖的攻守戰了。</p>
<p>不過你日常在這橋端望望，眞不信這橋畔會發生過戰爭；而且又是這麽的激烈。闊約丈許，長的二丈的橋面，東西平臥在污濁的沙涇港上。那河水黑得像墨水一般；中間且帶着呌人作嘔的奇臭；河中有時泊着幾艘艉艉船。橋的東端是水電路，路口豎着一株百年的銀杏，崢嶸的露着頭角。西端有着幾所矮小的民房，開着幾爿小店，那端可以直通柳營路。南北便是橫浜路，也是冷落異常，高大的洋房，大半燬於砲火，未復舊觀；私人的別墅和花園，也都荒蕪傾圯，在這點上便可以證明八字橋的得名，眞非偶然的了。</p>
<h3>殺人小姐</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>殺人小姐，這裏所說的，並不是猶在杭州獄中的陶姑娘，是別一位殺人不用兇器的小姐。</p>
<p>本文所說的殺人小姐是一位舍親。伊是自幼兒訂婚的，在八歲時，父母雙亡了，便在未婚的夫家住着。靑梅竹馬，兩小無猜，和未婚夫的感情，勝於兄妹，稍長，由伊的夫家，給伊念書，由小學而中學，居然的成了某中學的一位高材生。伊的未婚夫，滿想待伊中學卒業之後成婚，不料就在伊舉行畢業禮的前一月，伊突然的請了律師，向伊未婚夫要求取消在未成年時，父母給代訂的婚約。伊的未婚夫，那時正害着些兒輕微的病症，受了這一氣，病勢轉重了，不待訟事結束，便一瞑不視了。</p>
<p>未婚夫死後，伊的解除婚約，便很順利地解决了。於是便和伊的情人，正式結婚。伊的丈夫，本來是已娶有妻子的，爲了伊，把髮妻硬離掉的。他的髮妻，是一位想不開的女子，離婚之後，越想越窄，便背人吞着生雅片烟自盡了。但是伊和丈夫，快樂地同居了僅僅一年，伊發現了丈夫的不少劣點。而最使伊不能容忍的，是愛好宿娼，於是便毅然的要求離婚。涉訟了三個多月，離婚成功了，但是伊的丈夫，這個刺激，委實受得太深了，覺得太對不住前妻，日思夜想的，神經發生了變態，終於在一個晚上，從五層樓的屋頂上，跳下來，自了了殘生。</p>
<p>正是伊的前夫自殺的那一晚，伊在某大飯店中，和一位銀行家，舉行着婚禮。這位銀行家，娶得了這麼位如花似玉的交際家，樂不可支了，在經濟方面，莫說是有求必應，有時，並無所求，他也得設法的供奉。伊自從厠身於交際塲中之後，是沒曾遇到道如此爽快的男子的，所以也正是極度的深自慶幸嫁得如此好丈夫。但是伊的這位好丈夫，本來也是外强中乾的。同居了一年，已拉了不少的虧空。爲求彌補起見，於是私移着公欵，去作投機買賣。不料每戰必北，虧空得無法彌縫了，於是把心一橫，假旅館而自盡。</p>
<p>在這位殺人小姐手中，在短短的三年裏，已殺死了四人。在目前，伊是又在找尋着伊的對手了。但不知這個世界上，怎一位不幸者，將為伊的第五位犧牲者？我正爲伊的未來丈夫，捏着兩手心的汗。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　杯水盟心表燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>李友梅這回的探試，究竟不算白費，他已經在章國器家裏，看到了許多的痕跡了。回到家裏，說江小姐巳經來過一决了，他就微笑着點了兩點頭。在這日已是下午，不能出去了。到了次日早上，自己換了一套那時極時髦的藍鴛鴦格子短褂，白地紅梅點紗裙子，梳着光油油的頭，向江家來一。夢蘭正因爲學校停課三天，要舉行期考，這就在樓窗下桌面上攤書看。友梅站在房門口，伸了頭向裏面看着，然後站在門外，將手敲着門框，笑道：我可以進來嗎，夢蘭同頭看到，就起身相迎，笑道：你今天爲什麼這樣的客氣，友梅笑道，那我有我的原因。我在外而看到你在桌上寫字，我想着，或者不應當冒昧進來，夢蘭握了他的手讓他在書桌邊的椅子上坐着，笑道：你這話，我有點不可解。難道我作的功課，還怕你抄去去嗎？友梅笑道：我不是指着功課而言。說時，對了夢蘭微笑。夢蘭却很大方的坐在籘椅上，對他的言語，不怎麼理會。却是個他這全身的花衣服，倒打量了一番。友梅笑道：幸而你不是一位男子。你要是一位男子，我真不好意思。我每次來了，你總是週身上下，把我看一個夠。夢蘭笑道：那也不怪我看你。你這週身上下，花花點點的，倒活像一尊活觀音。友梅對自己身上的衣服，低頭看了一看，笑道：你是覺得花樣時髦一點吧？但是我有我的想法。在我們這樣靑春年少的時候，能穿花衣服不穿。到了將來年紀老的時候，看到別人穿花衣服，自已倒是後悔，那就遲了。夢蘭搖搖頭道：我的思想，與你不相同。我現在不想穿得太時髦，我一輩子也不會因沒時髦過就後悔的。友梅在自己心裏，已是把說話的章法，連連打了好幾個稿子，這就笑道：自然，人的善好，不但和各人的性情有關，而且與各人的身世也有關。早兩年，你是個天眞爛漫而又聰明的小姑娘，你也愛個熱鬧，你也愛個時髦。（九二）</p>

<h3>我母之死</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>母之愛是偉大的，是無條件的，不建筑在物質上的，可是沒福的我，突然把這愛於最近期間喪失了，那是一件多麼痛心的事啊！</p>
<p>我母生我兄弟二人，先嚴故世，我祗四歲，弟纔二歲，家徒四壁，無担石之儲，我母以十指之勞，茹苦鞠育。旣而我出辭外家，我母也來相依，自外祖父母死，我母乃擕弟離居，但仍不時前來撫視，二三十年來如一日，母恩如此，眞是昊天罔極哩。</p>
<p>近年來，我和弟等住居西門，我賃廡大南門，相距不遠，每隔數日，必前往探省。我雖强仕之年，而我母視我猶如孺子，見我至，輙出盎中糖果糕餌以餉。天寒雨雪，見我穿着西裝，總說單薄如此，不太冷嗎？不如改穿駝絨袍較爲溫暖。我日間雖任着職務，可是薪金不豐，不得不於晚上埋頭燈下，寫稿博潤資，藉以挹注，我母知道了，又時常勸我：「不要過用腦力，晚上早些休息，榮瘁了足以致病，不可不注意啊！」我處境拂逆，往往抱消極觀念。我母更曲警善喩，以解我愁，若我意未轉，那麼我母着急的了不得，致出涕謂：「我兒千切不可如此，日後娘老邁了，尙須靠你過活哩。一這時我兩眶熱淚，不覺滂沱而下。我母也淚訾相對，此情此景，回憶尙在目前，但是從今以後，再也沒有人關懷我，體貼我。因爲這關懷我，體貼我的母親，已拋我而去世了。</p>
<p>我母平日身體很健，早起助弟婦及傭僕操作，不辭疲勞。奈自年來忽患胃氣病，時發時愈，身體方面，大爲虧損。加之去冬姪兒家榮，以愛國運動，憤而自殺，家榮是我母最鍾愛的長孫，我母惋惜的了不得。從此鬱鬱不樂，直至今秋患着痢疾，同時又患着外症。疊請中西名醫診治，都說痢疾尙可爲，但這外症厥名爲「癌」，是很棘手的。可是後來創口漸小，我們都喜形於色，以謂我母死裏逃生，痊可有望的了。正預備俟我母身體復原後，好好的作一回家慶，豈料這家慶成爲幻夢，那死神伸着巨靈之掌，竟把我母一把抓了去啊！</p>
<p>我母病後，我每於斜日昏黃時，自戈登路校中歸來，必先至西門松雪街，在我母榻前慰問一下，或握着我母的手，探伊有沒有寒熱。却是總迷信着醫藥是萬能的，尤其是西醫的技術，那知醫藥在現時代尙幼穉得可憐，我痛我母的死，不禁要詛咒那一般所謂名醫了。</p>
<p>這天我因校中有事，回來較遲一些，這時已在旁晚六時許。不料一踏進門，我母已在彌留時候，我母一見我到，立刻撇手西逝。原來在四時許，我母巳呻吟欲絕的了。但家人在急忙中，找不到我的電話號數，祗得向我母說：「不要去啊！際雲尙沒有還來哩。」際雲就是我的字，我母常呌我際雲的。我母經此一提，有如服了興奮劑，把雙目張大了，向着門外望着，直望到我踏進房門，作此最後一面，才瞑目氣絕，這種慘痛的印像，在我腦幕中，真是深刻到萬分，此生此世，不會磨減的了。從此無論在什麼花香鳥語之候，山明水秀之區，燈紅酒緣之場，歡天喜地之際，祇要驀地想到這一幕慘痛的印像，頓時會得目瞪口呆，淚珠潛然而下，歸震川先妣事略所說的：「世乃有無每之人，天乎痛哉！」我真抱着同感呢。</p>

<h3>逃難與救國</h3>
<p>— （怡怡館主）</p>
<p>「逃難」！「逃難」！要知道，在這國難日亟期間，到處都有逢到「逃難」的可能。要是不快努力，消除國難，這「難」終有逃不過的一天！</p>
<p>友有從江灣逃到了租界，因為進出比較的便利，便天天晚上，不是逛跳舞塲，便是上電影院。我對他笑着說：「逃難不志娛樂」，他聽了一本正經地說：「娛樂不忘救國」！</p>
<h3>捻土</h3>

<p>太宗低頭，將御指一拾鏖土，彈入酒中。三藏不解其意。太宗笑道：「御弟呵！這一去，到西天，幾時可回？」三藏道：「只在三年，徑回上國。」太宗道：「日久年深，山遙路遠，御弟可進此酒；寗戀本鄕一捻土，莫愛　鄉萬兩金。」這是唐朝貞覩十三年的故事。</p>
<p>現在不是盛唐時代了，四萬萬太宗都拾了一撮鏖土，放入酒中，且飲且說：「這件事，幾時可了？莫管他，且進此酒；誓保祖國一捻土，不怕他人萬把槍！」</p>

<p>凡是到過廣西的，誰都終得要瞻仰一下金銀洞。</p>
<p>金銀洞是在思恩府城的南面，其地兩峯壁立，有一高崖，崖上書有：「金七里，銀七里，祗在七七里。」大字十一個。字寫得異常的遒勁，不知是何年所鐫鑿。崖下有一土地廟，爲附近土人所建造，會有堪輿家說該地有金銀氣，因之當地土人，曾多方搜求，但結果仍一無所得。後知崖的旁峯，尙有一洞，其中所見到累累的白銀，於是土人互相架木而登，入內拾之，竟不能帶出，或拾而向外拋擲，亦着地卽失。有人曾牽狗入，想將銀繫在狗身，牽之外出，但是牽時，狗必在吠，迨出，狗身的銀子亦沒了，故土人皆說洞中有靈，以後都相戒不敢入，據說至今仍如此。</p>

<h3>夫婦生活研究　性神經衰弱症　使妻不滿足的醫藥補救</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<p>……本症能影響婚後的幸福能使妻子發生煩惱愛情有破裂可能　……手淫惡癖是促成本症的重要原因故未婚時的青年應速戒除　……局部治療是不適當的由於本症的患處是中樞神經全部蒙害</p>
<p>性神經衰弱症影響婚後的幸福，這是盡人所知的事實。也無需我來詳細講述不過本文作者的宗旨，是要將一種有效的方法，掃除夫婦間的陰霾，使夫婦的愛情永長，歡樂一生。在未能說明其健康法之前，逐一將本症的發生原因，先作具體的叙述。</p>
<p>關於促成本症的原因雖有多種。可是，其中最令人恐懼的，還是在未婚時代青年人手淫過度的一事。因爲犯手淫方法非常簡單，而且非常自由，隨時隨地皆可行之，只憑眼耳等五官刺戟，或單憑想像，很易惹起性的興奮，所以易犯手淫過度症，尤其在手淫時無論身體上，精神上，都要消費過度精力，所以手淫過度後所誘起的陰萎，早洩，生殖器細小症，而特別眾多。</p>
<p>性的機能，在夫婦生活上很佔重要，它能將兩性的愛情很巧妙地連絡維繫着；男子的性機能健全，妻子的精神方面非常愉快。但有的丈夫會什麼喪失這種機能而使妻子煩惱呢？基於醫學的立塲言之，此完全爲青春腺（即生殖腺）的不健全之故。故必須服以真正的生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」即有顯著的效果。該藥爲奧國生理學大師斯丹那氏向雄壯動物提取其生殖腺素的精華製成，在未成功之時，曾作數十種的動物實騐，將軟性動物如鼠類，施用手術爲之補充生殖腺內分泌之後此鼠的生殖器即十分壯健；精神亦意外充足斯氏費三十餘年的心血始得成此舉世無匹的性神經衰弱病的對症良藥。原因由於本症的患處，乃中樞神經全部，而且性器官本身，不過僅有的末梢的神經吧了。即謂局部全然未生障碍也無不可。所以局部治療對於本症是不適當的，故必須利用此製劑作根本治療。</p>
<p>「生殖素」發明人奧國斯丹氏那用此製劑作鼠類試騐的情形。足證該藥成功儘合科學。</p>

<h3>必須從合理途徑以根治衰弱者的骨痛</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>……有四大原因可爆發本症　……治療得當至衰老亦不發</p>
<p>要想避免本症的侵襲，必須努力設法除去一切惹起骨痛的原因。促成骨痛的重要事項，便是氣候，過勞，縱慾，及煙酒等的漫無節制。此四者實爲本症爆發的重要因原。</p>
<p>氣候，很明顯地對於本症有密切關係。如在寒天而受寒，或在天雨時受雨水淋漓，及睡眠貪涼等等。均能使風濕內蘊，結果爆發本症。</p>
<p>其次，過勞能使骨節酸痛一事，亦是顯而易見的。每有操勞過度的人，時感腰背酸痛之苦。此外之縱慾好色，染有血毒，均能致青春腺早衰，全身抵抗力薄弱，因此之故，未到老年，即感全身骨痛之苦。</p>
<p>再，煙酒能刺激腸胃，若飲用過度，馬上便起倦怠感覺。同時能使瘋濕與血毒增加積累機會。故飲酒若成習慣，便是本症的唯一罹患者。</p>
<p>關於本症的治療，當腰背酸痛之時。一面服以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以增加抵抗力。同時須以祛瘋，除濕，清血毒，預防動脈硬化數種能力的「强斯登氏骨痛片」治之。不僅能使已患者迅速復元。而能使未患者體力增强。精神充足。雖至老年龍鍾時，可保證絕無骨痛發作。可享一生的健康。</p>
<h3>戒烟方法的選擇　衰弱戒烟者的合理有效法</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>首先，先把人們所以成癮的原因叙述一下，然後再講述衰弱者的安全戒烟法，纔能使讀者格外明白。</p>
<p>鴉片的成癮原因，完全由於烟毒的一入人體，很易把全身的細胞麻醉。故久吸之後即能成癮。一方面各細胞染毒之後即起呆滯作用，必須藉烟力的刺激方能營新陳代謝的功能。因此之故，吸者如減少烟量，即覺精神不支，假使完全斷絕。則全身各細胞陷入奄奄狀態。就能影響全身的康健，一切弊病隨之顯示，如精神萎頓，四肢酸軟，頭昏腦脹，坐臥不安。失眠，盜汗，心悸，健忘，接踵而起，使戒者固有之微弱的抵抗力，不足以消滅此種痛苦，平時體質孱弱者，愈形狼狽。甚至有發生生命危險。因此之故，被捕之烟犯，多有死亡者。</p>
<p>衰弱吸者的戒烟困難，也無需作者浪費筆墨，再來講述，此幾爲人盡所知了。根據醫學的理論加以分析，衰弱的所以形成，完全由烟毒侵入生命源泉的生殖腺以致生殖腺萎頓，結果喪失其固有的新陳代謝能力，故凡屬癮君子者，大都罹有陰萎早洩。必須吸烟之後方能行房事，故衰弱戒烟者欲求安然斷癮，則必須利用培補戒烟服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』方可，因它具有强大的滋補力，足以撲滅烟毒而有餘，故戒者能於不知不覺間見烟自厭，保證無絲毫痛苦感覺。</p>

<h3>手淫遺精療法的新貢獻</h3>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>……掃蕩一切陳腐遲緩的舊醫藥以滿足患者的理想　……確立新穎簡易的有效治法爲現代醫壇大放光明</p>
<p>遺精爲青年常有的疾病，健康的人，十天半月，精滿而溢，尚無妨礙，若次數稍多，精液損失過甚，身體神經均感衰弱。高度患者，甚至晝寢亦遺，閱讀淫猥之書報即遺，見女色亦遺。患者的精關既如此寬弛，對於射精，自己毫無控制能力，婚後當然要發生早洩而妨礙畢生的幸福了。</p>
<p>爲了健康，爲了幸福，多量的年青人嗷嗷待哺似的乞治於醫者，然而醫生對於這些可憐的病人有何幫助呢？適宜的療法向感缺乏，醫生惟有盡他的能力，用許多無關痛癢或難於實行的方法，使他的病人們去胡亂嘗試。</p>
<p>他們對病人說：你們一定要熟眠，多夢易醒，務須避免。可是怎樣去獲得熟眠呢？醫士們就束手了，併且許多於熟睡中也能遺洩的。患者，對於此種療法，實在得不到半點好處。此外呢，又有些什麼讓龜頭少受些摩擦；刺戟龜頭，使其不致感覺過敏；以及以安慰勸告之法，使之勿生遺精恐佈心，鎮靜其神經等等，皆屬敷衍之道。至於賜保命的注射，其功效不過使人精盛力足，對於精關的控制，毫無功效可言，用以治療遺精，未免有風馬牛不相及之感想。</p>
<p>最新的醫學研究早已否定了上述各法的效騐，而眾口一詞地稱讚德國希米脫博士的新療法。原來一種佳良之療法約有三種優點，一爲功效之確實無弊；一是簡單易行，不感痛苦；一是奏效迅速。而希氏的方法適都有包括這幾種優點而略無缺懲。</p>
<p>他採最精純的藥料，最細心的配製方法，製成『希米脫氏固精片』，有固精確效，並備具上述之優點。當發明時博士在實騐室中足足研究廿五年之久，認爲確具實效，始流行世界，治愈者何止百萬。全球醫界治療實例及研究報告，散佈於歐美醫藥刊物中者，皆於此藥，交口讚美。不過，遺精治愈之後，已往所損失的康健，宜服『生殖素』以補其虛虧，『生殖素』係斯丹那博士所發明，與『希米脫氏固精片』互相補助，實係珠聯璧合。一時瑜亮。二藥同服，有事半功倍的名實相符之效益，余藉此二藥臨診治愈者，亦難數計。</p>

<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>治骨痛的心得</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>—必須對症下藥方可永逸—</p>
<p>一種流行的疾病，散佈極廣，而始終無絕對有效的療法，患者既感痛苦難脫，醫生也因束手無策，只有仰首嘆息的份兒，在這種醫藥無靈之際，醫界不免覺得那是自己的羞恥。</p>
<p>骨痛正是這樣一種的病，因了操勞過度，荒淫不節，花柳餘毒，風寒內蘊，血液中產生多量的尿强酸，酸素結晶後鑽入骨髓，使之作痛，血管中酸素太多時，更能引起動脈硬化中風等病，中年以上的男女差不多十之七八，有此通病。</p>
<p>如何去撲滅這病魔呢？醫藥界爲了這問題，已徬徨多時，一向只能以麻醉性藥劑止痛於大發作的時候，對於病的本身，簡直無法可想。</p>
<p>現在可以美國强斯登博士所發明的「强斯登氏骨痛片」治之，靈效無比，雖病至半身不遂，亦能在短期治好。</p>
<p>患者吳明輝，浙江紹興人，年已五十一歲，身體素弱，早年時感腰背痠痛之苦，因忽於治療，遂變惡化，釀成半身不遂症，服藥十餘種均無效騐，後由余用『强斯登氏骨痛片』治之，衹服四盒，頓覺骨節輕鬆，舉動靈活，痛苦完全解脫。</p>
<h3>女性的美容與生育　健美及姙娠的成功之路</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>女子如在成熟時不能獲得美滿的發育，則乳房一定萎癟不能高聳，同時臀部的曲線也不能顯露，這種人當然沒有健美可言。與不能生育的女子同樣悲慘煩惱。不過不姙的原因不如上述的簡短。實在有幾種，特別最重要者爲月經不調，子宮障碍，白帶及淋病等。此外性器畸形，也能不姙。體質素弱者，易以流產，或雖產出亦不能長大。故亦列入不姙之例。</p>
<p>如欲補救以上之缺點，則生殖腺素製劑之『生殖素』能使發育轉佳，服後乳峯能驟然高聳，臀部也異乎丯腴，同時月經調整，子宮障碍盡除，故若無淋病及白帶者，衹須服『生殖素』保證很快姙娠，而且健美可期，所產出的小孩，決不會先天不足而夭逝。不過如罹有淋病，則非服黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』不爲功。其他合製劑均非所宜，因合製劑除黃色素與伐克辛之外，餘均有損腸胃，副作用甚大，故受害者不如凡幾。此外白帶應以『療帶靈』止之，上述之法，經過無數醫師實騐所證明，爲求生育與健美的合理要圖。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>縱火</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>上海灘九教三流，五花十門，常常有出乎人之常情的別開生面的新聞發生的。以縱火營生，不過是許許多多中之一。</p>
<p>照理，人是「惻隱」的，「慈悲」的動物，無論對什麼事都朝好的方面着想的，斷沒有自己打斷百己的生機的道理。所謂「置之死地而後生」，也不外是「破釜沉舟」的意思，而决不是先毁滅了自己再來講話。不過，這只是死道理，聰明如人的，却會「活」用的。我們知道，保險事業的由來，是因為人都想安全，保火險以防火災，是希冀期納少許保險金；可以省去不斷的提心吊膽，抱了燒了有保險的心理，所以寗願吃點眼前虧。本來這是人的缺點，但火險事業却建築在這缺點上生存着。不过，「强中自有强中手」，雖然火險事業是利用了人類苟安的心理上的缺點，但有些人却反而利用這缺點的缺點，而給苦它吃的。所以，從這看來，縱火營生也嘸啥希奇。</p>
<p>日前本埠新聞載：破獰縱火機關。略謂：有俄人在滬密製縱火機器專以代人放火，向保險公司索償賠欵為業。近已破獲，帶案一人，繼又續獲三人。當日晚報續載；據被獲七犯供是先由一人以毛皮等物委託拍賣行拍賣，故抬高價，并由同夥州六千元拍得。便用此憑單購買火險六千元，混入堆棧後，才設法縱火圖賠。由此，我們可知這二縱火營生」的組綴已不如我們所想那麽簡單，不但有組織，而且有計劃地去做的。同時，我們更不應該忽略的便是，他們甚至不惜製造放火機器，來遂行這種陰謀。可見此事幷不尋常了。</p>
<p>現在，旣被破獲，愛好刺戟的上海人當然又一新眼月。罪淤的結果及判刑不在題內，我們不去管。在這裏設們只想對這種犯罪的因果，寫點感想。</p>
<p>犯罪而至有組織，這是近代文明，以及所謂科學管理所促成的結果。同時，翻轉來說，如果我們光是消極的去事前防備，或者事後的嚴厲處刑；那幷不會使犯罪案件减少，相反地只有使犯罪者一天，一天地嚴密地驚人起來。這是歸究到這問題是否因判刑便解决了這上面去。比方，縱火這一件事，從前雖間有之，那不外是「窮則通，通則變」的演化，倒不會像現時這件這麽地有組織有方法。縱火而要製造機器，這事情的嚴重可想而知。但，他們對於一件犯罪為什麽要這樣「絞盡腦汁」呢？為什麼把這樣的精神浪費在計劃犯罪上面呢？回答很簡單，那不外是：「他們要活，就要吃飯；而這社會沒飯給他吃，他便只有「鋌而走險」。因為這「縱火」到底是可以「營生」，到底還「有利可圖」，為了生活，他們不得不如此了。那麽，如果我們能如此了解，那更嘸啥希奇了。</p>
<h3>偷青賊</h3>
<p>— 石驊</p>
<p>幽綠的天邊，星兒閃着乳白色的光，在天邊飛無着。雲的後面有一道光透出，幽綠的天邊顯出紫羅蘭；後來又添上金色和玫瑰色，天空變成溫和的薄紫色。</p>
<p>那個約摸有八九分圓的月兒，散着乳白的光茫，野亮的，河面怪幽靜的，水波也分外地平静。月兒倒印在水面上，還是圓圓的一個。</p>
<p>「怪不得今晚月亮這麽好，原來還祇十八呢」。約摸祇有十五六歲的小夥子，身子倒怪結實的，就是個子矮了一些，臉是渾圓的，笑起來像隻貓，還有那副闊嘴巴，見了真呌人笑呢。</p>
<p>「倒看不出你，充起假斯文來了。快睡吧，小心今晚有人偷青呢」。這個，個子比較的長一些，可是身子却沒有他結賓，就是兩只臂膊拿來比一此，也差得遠呢。這時他躺在席子上，破棉絮蓋了半個把身子，把身畔的坐着的那個同伴死勁地用力拉，意思是要他舉下來。</p>
<p>「放心，今晚這麽好的月亮，還怕那些「毛賊」來愉青」？</p>
<p>［挑根，不是俺阿龍生今天賣老，說不定今晚要發大霧呢。讓人家偷去了，可要倒霉呢」。</p>
<p>桃根半價半不信的，但也沒奈何，祗得躺下。</p>
<p>夜已經很淡了，漠野裏，靜靜的，死像去了一般。</p>
<p>果真發霧了！月亮像罩上了一層濃濃的紗罩也似的，光芒就因此而淡下去了。地面上也像頓時罩上了一層黑紗。河面塞滿了那濃郁的濕氣。沿河的幾顆樹，像攀上了厚厚的蛛蜘網似的，沉沉的，風也透不過來。</p>
<p>霧真深了，大地黑到不能再黑的地步了，黑漆漆的，連狗都怕得不敢再呌了。風吹在西稻田裏，只聽得呼呼的聲音，不能看見那搖動着的東西。假如這時有人在趕路的話，準會跨到河裏去的。</p>
<p>「聽，有人呢」。聲音是小到快要聽</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>不出的程度。</p>
<p>「晤——」抹抹眼，桃根以為自己沒有張開呢，却不知這是霧的昏黑。</p>
<p>「哦！」一頓好揍。桃根把拳頭在空中揚了一揚，但，沒有看見。</p>
<p>「跟我來」。兩個人，悄悄地，提着脚尖走。</p>
<p>那邊仍舊是「此此」的割刈聲，怪紆緩的，像是個不熟練的生手似的。</p>
<p>他倆輕輕地走到離那割刈聲不遠的地方，那個愉靑賊似乎還沒有知道，還在割。這時阿龍生抖了一抖身子，抽出那把小刀，呌聲「來吧」，就着就向那裏撲過去，桃根也輕快的跟了上去。</p>
<p>那個偷靑賊怪沒力氣的，阿龍生輕輕的一把，就掀他在地上了。四個拳頭落在那個怪瘦的身子上，像劈柴似的。</p>
<p>那個偷靑賊一聲不響地任他們打，不還手，也不討饒。就好像死去了一般的。</p>
<p>「哦，怎麽不聲響呢？阿龍生，你點根火，照照看，不要讓他裝死，哼，這個刁賊」。說着又是一拳。</p>
<p>「啊！罪過」。剩餘的半根把洋火，往地上一丟，熄了。阿龍生漠然地坐了下來。</p>
<p>「幹什麽啦」？桃根還以為是他中了暗器。</p>
<p>「是你爺呢」！</p>
<p>「什麼」？</p>
<p>「是你爺」！</p>
<p>「我的爺」？</p>
<p>兩個子把地上的那個賊扶起來，那個老頭子，滿臉是污泥跟血，氣是喘得比什麽都利害的，眞是桃根的爺。</p>
<p>這時，似乎覺得舒服丁些，沒力的把兩片眼皮張了一張，隨着又合上了。只聽得他微微在說。</p>
<p>「桃兒，你太忠心了」。</p>
<h3>瘋子</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>清晨。天剛泛着白色。</p>
<p>這水村里唯一的，那老財主家里養的公鷄在喔喔的呌着。聲音很宏亮，把人都從睡夢里呌醒過來了。</p>
<p>船屋（註）里鑽出蓬鬆着頭髮的婆娘伸兩下懶腰，打一個阿欠，又在開始他們這一天的工作，有些是到對過羅村里去帮工，做岸上人的生活；有些，家里男人趕漁汛去了，便散伙兒騎點小船，到楊家港那邊去網幾罟魚，好趕明兒龍頭圩，換點子米飯錢。這樣，他們便開始忙碌着了。張網的張網，拿着了槳的，便到海邊去推船，大家都把全副精神對付在工作里了，口里微微地哼着幾句鹹水歌，調和着空氣。</p>
<p>太陽從水里洗了一個澡，翻起身了，光瞪着眼珠子像已有點認不得這隔了一夜的大地了似的。陽光還不至於燙入，溫和而且慈愛，撫摩着人的赤棗色的面膚，像是鼓勵着他們；放點勇氣吧！人活了是為了鬥爭的！</p>
<p>福嫂子和三大嬸這趟兒合伙兒趕一朝晨網了。因為現在這末個秋天，月初的潮水是在淸晨漲進的。朝水頭下面兜截一網，少說也得二三十斤，好賣一市，飽幾天了。不是嗎？人誰又不是向上爬的，有一天過一天，過得一天又望過第二天的了。</p>
<p>「阿福哥還沒有起來嗎？人一歇下來便懶的了。今天是大汛，如果他能趕早來帮點忙，怕不更好市嗎？福嫂子你便喊一喊他吧，我家阿牛年紀又小，不是……」三大嬸屈着指頭計算日子，像記起了什末似的，衝着福嫂子說。</p>
<p>「是啊，我且去喊喊他吧！」福嫂子漫應着，但沒有立刻便回去喊他的丈夫，她在躊躇着。失了業幾個月的阿福哥的脾氣，她是很淸楚的。愛吵鬧，也愛駡人，半夜三更還趕往離村幾里遠的地方推牌九，飲雙蒸酒，大伙兒散了，才哼呀哼的一搖三擺地回來拍門，累入家在家里獃祖心。昨天，他也還是四更一點，靠天亮才回來，現在去擾他，怕不正吃一個巴掌嗎？因此，福嫂子在那里遲疑着。</p>
<p>潑辣的三大嬸沒原諒她，喝着問：「要去就去羅！太陽上了山便要遲了咧！」</p>
<p>「去！去！……唔，三嬸你可曉得他近來的脾氣眞不好惹，怕討不到好，還要吃他的拳頭！」</p>
<p>「自家兒老公便怕死露了風，他又不是歇得懶蛇一樣嗎？而且是為的大家兒吃飯……」</p>
<p>福嫂子一氣，便沒等潑辣的三大嬸說完，登登登地便朝家裏那破船屋跑去了。</p>
<p>這時，這水村的一切都給太陽照得生氣了。雖然太長久的飢餓纏繞着它，使它像條垂死的黃狗在伸着舌頭滴着口水歇氣，但有時也頗顯得煞是威風的。哪靠河的一排水松樹，很整齊的衛護着這飢饉的荒村。這時，給風撼動得更為好看了。</p>
<p>福嫂子鑽進了破船屋，低聲地喊着：「喂！喂！起來呵！今早赶大汛，三大嬸說要你帮忙嘞！喂喂！</p>
<p>「唔……」這個嬾嬾地轉了一個側，又熟睡去了｛</p>
<p>等福嫂子不耐煩地嘮叨了幾决的時候，却撈起了我們阿福哥的睡不醒的憤怒了。帶着惺忪的眼睛，昏沈沈的腦袋還記得昨夜在德興館那裏大伙子的說話，猛地便從床上跳了起來，衝着倒霉的福嫂子便猛撲，口嘩啦嘩啦地便呌喊着了——</p>
<p>「你媽個×，吵醒了老子幹嗎？死絕種，十八代媽媽個爛臭×，都是你這個掃帚星，入門赶鬼，媽的爛臭貨，我打死你這老舉精……」</p>
<p>福嫂子沒頭沒臉地便給赶了出來。那個像個關公樣拖了把掃帚跟着在後頭追赶。以慈和出名的阿福哥，也打起老婆來了。村里憂愁着末日似的流佈着這消息，留着的人都從船屋里鑽出來看把戲了。三大嬸，這個惹禍的傢伙，舌頭一伸，把船拖向海邊里去。待福嫂子赶到，她已扳起了漿預備駛向楊家港去了</p>
<p>阿福哥突着眼睛，呆瞧着福嫂子哭着喊着赶上了漁船撐出了時，他的臭罵聲漸漸地低下來了。</p>
<p>「你媽個爛臭×，老舉養的，要我……」</p>
<p>罵不下去了。人是低下了頭，像畏羞地，把兩手拱成一團，狼狽地走着。不懂事的小孩子，跟在他的後面擲着小石子，和臭駡着。</p>
<p>「看喲，看喲，烏龜打老婆！」</p>
<p>「別看我年紀靑，大來好過鳥　情！」</p>
<p>孩子們編着的歌謠，他抵受不住了。牙齒一緊，紅筋綳上了額角，握着拳頭便想揍一頓爽快。</p>
<p>砰—一顆石子敲着他的眉心，連心里都隱隱作痛了。於是，邁開大步，睜得圓圓大大的眼睛像冒着火，手伸開芭蕉樣大，向着這班頑皮傢伙追來了。</p>
<p>孩子駭得躲在媽的懷裏，媽把門關上了，教訓着孩于：不要跟那不長進的瘋子玩。</p>
<p>（附註）水上人上岸住，除了茅棚之外，大多數還是搬了破船上岸，這就呌做船屋。</p>
<h3>旅</h3>
<p>— 陸嘉</p>
<p>火車蜿蜓的行列在七月的原野上劃一條墨黑的蠕動的綫。</p>
<p>黃河北岸的荒原恰似塞北的漠野，一沾一株綠草和碧樹。黃土展延到地平綫上，彌接着淡黃的沙土蒙蔽的天。，茅屋頂的炊烟生勁地挿到佈滿晚霞的穹空裏。黃昏的天際的雲彩是多變的；一道橙黃，一道絳紫，變幻着羊羣和駱隊。又圓又大的太陽一團火似地落進長河。撲滿黃沙的旅客背着笨重的行囊，疲倦地在彎曲的小道上蹣跚，一股長風就會曳去似地。</p>
<p>車廂裏有着過高的溫度與過高的乘客的密度，可是列車却沒有高的速度，斜倚着窗口的單身的旅客眺望着夜墮到野地裏，覺着有點不耐煩和煢獨。</p>
<p>單調的輪聲配着腕上單調的小手錶，時間慢慢地踱着，在殘弱的慘紅的燈光下，一堆庸俗的臉龐，忠厚而樸質的臉上有兩顆怯生的疲倦的眼睛。那打呵欠的恣態和歪在椅背上的睡眠的粗蠢的鼾聲，在長途旅行者簡直不是慰藉而是要引起嘔吐的惡感了。厭惡地把眼睛移開，留在匆匆退過的電桿上和素樸單調的傍晚的漠野上。</p>
<p>大地以落日為圓軸，鋼軌為圓周。火車就沿着圓周的弧錢而奔馳。一方方扇形的田轉過去，周而復始似地永世也轉不完。在旅行的人計算時間和計算旅程是最愚蠢的事；聰明的是怎麽消磨這樣長的時問，或者怎麽在不知覺中讓自己的目的地送到。</p>

<p>可是這在一個單身客却是太難，太難。</p>
<p>一個人坐在車廂陰暗的一角，手撐着下巴，用陰森的冷犀的眼波探測荒原的闊度。野景漸漸自動縮小，縮不到壓到窗口上的時候，神秘的應進行的速度是更遲緩了。暮野是更單調，更寂寞。除了濃的影子，淡的影子，卽使要辨別景物也是困難的。</p>
<p>野地的凉風只有把首面把臂灣伸到窗外去才會感覺到。車廂粵凝住的濃厚的空氣與外面沒有對流，夾雜着鄉下人的汗臭與土臭。一個個鵝蠢的北方人的軀投一個搖曳的影子在地上，沉着的呼吸把空氣弄得更污濁些。單身的旅客依舊是對着小窗外的一方濃厚的夜，皺着眉尖，焦燥的眼波劃出去，把夜幕刺破似地。</p>
<p>度過一座野站，野站上浮盪着幾盞搖曳的燈影與搖曳的入影。車像閉了氣一樣地喘息着。有幾個人下去，有幾個人上來。燈籠把野站映出一個朦朧的輪廓，人就在光與暗的交織中游來游去。縱然只是一兩分鐘的逗留，在旅行的人却覺得是一個了不起的長時間，而有點焦燥不安了。</p>
<p>不安地在座位上扭動着身軀，等火車粗壯的汽聲喊起，便又咄咄地衝着黑暗奔向深邃的夜。獨身者凝着山羊的眼，了無感觸似地呆對着壓在窗口上的夜的顏面。</p>
<p>漫無止休的旅程，漫無止休的時間，伴着獨身旅客的心腔的跳動是小手錶單調的聲息與單調的機聲。</p>

<h3>上海將映「馬戲團」</h3>
<p>人類是平等的，沒有人種和種族的歧視。無論紅種，黃種，黑種，都有平等的樣利。這是「馬戲團」的主題。但這樣一個偉大的主題，也豫「血花二樣，它用輕鬆的調子展開來的，卽使最持偏見的人，也難說它有宣傳意味，這不能不歸功於技巧。蘇聯的導演現在是廣泛地利用着「形式輔助內容」來補充「內容决定形式一，如果這句話是對的話。</p>
<p>「馬戲團」敘說一個美國女藝，因與黑人生養一個黑小孩，為「文明人」所不齒，被驅逐出境，她逃判蘇聯，因技藝的高超，她在這民族平等的國家裏得到了羣衆的愛戴，雖然她的領班的當衆宣佈她的「秘密」（與黑人戀愛），但蘇聯觀衆反抱起了黑小孩唱催眠歌。</p>

<h3>Preparing for the Seventh Meeting: The Japanese Side Makes Final Agreements; Suma Invites Two Military Attaches for Talks; Discussing Countermeasures with Kawagoe and Others; Japanese Authorities Monitor Chiang's Actions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe continues to listen to Suma's reports and, together with Kita, Wakasugi, and others, engages in discussions. The date for the seventh meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang is imminent, but the exact time will be decided in two days. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the return of Consul-General Suma to Nanjing, the seventh meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe is expected to begin on the afternoon of the 2nd. Local newspapers all believe this to be the final stage of the current Sino-Japanese negotiations. Chiang Kai-shek's recent trip to Xi'an and Luoyang, his meetings with important military leaders in North China, Chiang's recent speeches, especially his interview with the Ta Kung Pao reporter, the signs of a national patriotic movement climax, and the unprecedented enthusiastic celebration of Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday, have all made a very significant and profound impression on Tokyo. Although the newspapers here have published the above-mentioned situations in prominent positions, and used eye-catching headlines to indicate their importance and the government's close attention, they are commenting with particular caution. Only the Asahi Shimbun today pointed out the importance of increasing cooperation and unity within China. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Consul-General Suma of Nanjing, at 9:00 AM on the 1st, invited Army Attache Amemiya and Navy Attache Nakahara to his residence to convey the general situation in Japan and explain the unified final policy of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries. They then held various discussions on future countermeasures. In the afternoon, with Ambassador Kawagoe as the center, local leaders such as Wakasugi, Suma, Yoshioka, and Matsumura were mobilized to hold a final consultation based on the new instructions, and made a complete and concrete plan with an extremely cautious attitude.

<h3>The Siege of Jingyuan City Has Been Completely Lifted; The National Army Has Chased to the Banks of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou) Military news: A certain division of the National Army advanced north from Guocheng, Jingyuan to suppress the bandits. Fierce battles took place on the 29th and 30th, and another great victory was won. The troops of the division are now in Jingyuan, and the siege of the city has been completely lifted. The details are as follows: It was found that the pseudo-31st Army and the independent division of the pseudo-4th Army, which were defeated by the National Army in the Yiyuantou Baihu area in the southern district of Jingyuan, fled north under the cover of night. The National Army divided into left and right wings and pursued them at full speed. At dawn on the 29th, they encountered the bandits on the high ground west of Xizhai, Lishu'er, and Wangjia. The bandits stubbornly resisted from the dangerous terrain, and the National Army took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack, and has advanced to the Hongbaozi area 40 miles north of Guocheng. The corpses of bandits were scattered everywhere, and the number of casualties was no less than a thousand, especially many middle and lower-level pseudo-military officers. More than 300 people were captured, more than 200 long and short guns, more than 100 horses, and a lot of baggage were seized. The remnants of the bandits fled west to the mountains west of Hongbaozi and north to the Tongjingyuan Avenue. Near Daleizi at noon, the bandits reunited with some of the pseudo-4th and 5th Armies that had fled from both sides, and invaded the position in an attempt to resist stubbornly. The National Army arrived at the location and launched a fierce attack on the bandits, and the bandits were defeated soon. More than 100 people were captured, more than 30 horses were seized, and 50 short guns were seized. The bandits died and were injured countlessly. The remnants fled east, and the National Army divided into two groups and followed them day and night. At Shenshi on the 30th, they chased to the banks of the Yellow River near Heibaokou and Hongzuizi. It happened that some of the bandits were crossing the river, and were killed by the National Army, and those who were drowned in the river were countless, and 6 empty boats were destroyed. The two ferries and the upper and lower Baizhuzi and other places east of Qingyuan have all been recovered. The siege of Jingyuan City has been completely lifted, and the National Army is still continuing to search and suppress the bandits and advance. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) Zhu Mao Xu He's remnant bandits searched for civilian leather rafts and wooden boards in various areas of Jingyuan, transported them to the river bank, and crossed the river one after another. The National Army waited until the remnants on the east bank were cleared, and then crossed the river to pursue them, annihilating them all in one fell swoop, so as to prevent them from penetrating into the counties west of the river. According to people from the front, since the bandits fled to Gansu, they have been running east and west, and have been unable to gain a foothold anywhere. They lack bullets, clothing, and food, and cannot get a full meal for several days. At this time, they are still wearing single-layer clothes. The area west of the river is barren and sparsely populated. Even if the bandits fled in, they will freeze and starve to death without being chased. In recent days, the National Army's suppression has been like destroying dead trees and rotten wood. The day when they will be completely wiped out is at hand. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fuzhou Business Circles Request Relief from Financial Panic; Hope Four Banks Will Accept Real Estate as Collateral, Otherwise Business Guilds Will Organize a Relief Association Themselves</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The various business guilds in this city have recently observed that the decline of business in Fujian Province and the stagnation of all industries are due to the concentration of finance in the banks, which has prevented circulation in the market. Furthermore, banks do not accept credit loans or real estate mortgages, resulting in a sudden financial panic throughout the city, which has affected various counties. Before the reform of the currency system in the province, there were more than 40 money shops in the provincial capital, each issuing credit notes with an average value of more than 300,000 yuan based on their original capital and deposits. It is estimated that the total amount circulating in the market and lent to merchants was more than 12 to 13 million yuan, directly circulating in the provincial capital and indirectly flowing into various counties. Therefore, production activities and annual exports amounted to no less than 40 million yuan. As a result, although there were several political changes, they only caused temporary stagnation and were quickly restored, which was due to the activity of finance. Today, all industries are declining and production is decreasing, which is the opposite of the previous scene of killing each other in imports and exports. Although the Ministry of Finance allocated one million yuan last year to relieve the financial situation, only more than 400,000 yuan was lent out. It is really distressing that the conditions are too strict, such as a monthly interest rate of 9%, a term of 6 months, a real estate appraisal discount of half the value, and a business limited to 5,000 yuan. In addition, fire insurance and property rights registration are required, which are heavy burdens. With the short term, the interest rate must be 1.45% when combined. Large businesses cannot borrow enough with 5,000 yuan, and small businesses do not have 10,000 yuan worth of assets. The government has spent a lot of effort, but the contractors are perfunctory and the adjustments are not thorough, making it difficult to see real benefits. A meeting was specially held the other day to discuss relief measures, and it was resolved to request the government to be mindful of the fact that Fujian's commerce is on the verge of bankruptcy, and to order the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers in Fuzhou to allocate 5 million yuan specifically for the mortgage of real estate for various businesses, in order to promote commercial activities and encourage production. The interest rate is temporarily set at 4.5%, and the mortgage period is extended. If there is no overdue interest, it will be allowed to rotate for two years. The four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers will each be responsible for their respective share. The four banks will each send one person to work together with the responsible person appointed by each business guild to handle the matter. The organization will be temporarily located at the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, so that business information will not be hindered and relief will be substantial. The name of the organization and the articles of association will be drafted jointly by the responsible persons and submitted for approval after the loan is approved. If the general offices of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers believe that this method does not comply with the regulations and cannot be accepted, then the various business guilds will have difficulty in turning around and will have to take self-rescue measures. It is proposed to allow the various business guilds to organize the Fujian Provincial Capital Financial Relief Association themselves, which will still be located at the County Chamber of Commerce, with the real estate collected by each business as a guarantee for the fund to issue Fujian Provincial Capital Commercial Mutual Aid Coupons (for example, 1 million yuan of real estate will issue 1 million yuan of mutual aid coupons, and so on, but not exceeding 3 million yuan). The association will be managed by responsible persons elected by the various business guilds who are respected, fair, and substantial. The provincial government will be requested to send personnel to supervise and audit receipts and expenditures at any time. The scope of use of the coupons will be limited to this city, and the circulation period will be set at three years, after which it will be completely terminated, so that commercial difficulties can be slightly relieved and the crisis can be resolved. The resolution has now been made into a memorandum and sent to the Chamber of Commerce for submission to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Fujian Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Fujian Provincial Government, requesting approval of the request and ordering the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers in Fuzhou to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of Recent Chinese Finances (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Sun Huai Ren</p>
<p>The historical inability of Chinese finance to balance revenue and expenditure, which is almost identical to the situation in other countries, is caused by the excessive expansion of military and debt expenditures. However, the deficits of the recent two or three years also contain a new factor, namely the reduction of tax revenue—here, the reduction of tariffs is obviously the most significant.</p>
<p>In the budgets of the last three years, the tax revenue for the 23rd year was 73.1 million yuan, and for the 24th year, it was 69.6 million yuan, a decrease of 3.5 million yuan compared to the previous year. In the most recent 25th year, the total tax revenue was 68 million yuan, a decrease of 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous year, and a decrease of 5.1 million yuan compared to the year before. This figure is still a grand and dignified budgetary assumption, and in reality, it may be even more drastically reduced. For example, the difference between the budgeted and finalized figures for tax revenue in the 22nd year is as shown in the final table: (Unit: Thousands of Yuan)</p>
<p>Here, except for the salt and consolidated taxes, all were less than the budgeted amount. In Chinese fiscal revenue, customs duties have always been the most important, but in recent years they have been declining in a straight line. According to the statistics of the 24th year's customs yearbook, customs revenue has been decreasing year by year in the last five years. In the 24th year, only 31.5 million yuan was collected, a decrease of 70 million yuan compared to the figure in the 20th year of the Republic of China. This reduction in customs duties is partly due to the reduction in imported goods in recent years, and partly due to the increasing prevalence of smuggling. According to news reports earlier this month, the loss of customs duties due to smuggling in North China alone since August of last year has reached 90 million yuan. As for the salt tax, as a result of efforts to increase the tax rate and change the weighing system (changing the Sima scale to the market scale, which is about 20% different) in recent years, it has been increasing year by year. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the total salt tax revenue was 184 million yuan, an increase of 14 million yuan compared to the figure in the 20th year of the Republic of China five years ago. As for the consolidated tax, it is also increasing due to the increase in the tax rate and the increase in the types of goods. The revenue in the 24th year of the Republic of China was 116 million yuan, an increase of 36 million yuan compared to the 20th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, the changes in the revenue of the three major taxes, customs, salt, and consolidated tax, in the last five years are not worth the loss. The total increase in salt and consolidated taxes is only 50 million yuan, while the customs duty has decreased by 70 million yuan.</p>
<p>Today, the external pressure is becoming more and more serious, and customs duties may be even more reduced. As for the salt tax, it will probably not increase any more (the riots of salt farmers in the north and south and the surge of salt grabbing are all indicating that the salt tax burden has reached its maximum limit). Moreover, there is another reason why the salt tax has increased in the past, which is not that people actually consume so much salt, but that the salt farms urged to transport the salt out as much as possible, and at the same time, the tax was levied on the transported salt. Therefore, the increase in the salt tax in the past partly contained the nature of spending money in advance. Only the consolidated tax has more prospects. The central government's unification is becoming more and more complete, and of course the consolidated tax is also becoming more and more increased. But it is absolutely impossible in fact to make up for the reduction of customs duties with the increased consolidated tax! In the tax revenue example of the 22nd year that we mentioned earlier, although the actual revenue of most of the taxes was less than the budgeted amount, fortunately, because there was a large increase in the salt and consolidated taxes, the total amount of actual tax revenue still exceeded the total budgeted amount. But the situation is different now. In the most recent 25th year, customs duties will decrease no matter what (in the case where smuggling cannot be stopped, the decrease in customs duties should not be a problem. Even if the smuggling is suppressed, I am afraid that the reduction of the tax rate is already inevitable, so of course it will also reduce customs revenue); the salt tax has entered a standstill state, and it can no longer be like the 22nd year, which will increase above the budgeted figure; and the reduction of various taxes other than the consolidated tax is even more expected. Here, only the consolidated tax and the income tax are relatively close to the budget, but the total annual revenue of the two is only 13.78 million yuan.</p>
<p>The authorities are not unaware of this gradual downward trend in tax revenue. Therefore, the budget for tax revenue in the 25th year has been reduced by several million yuan compared to the previous two years. But although the budget for tax revenue in the 25th year has been reduced, the expenditure in the 25th year is an unprecedentedly large amount. Therefore, in order to seek the suitability of the revenue and expenditure budget on the surface, the revenue other than taxes is deliberately inflated as a matter of policy (see the previous list). For example, the net profit of state-owned businesses is mostly the surplus of the Central Bank and the interests of various official shares. Like last year, although the Central Bank obtained huge profits due to the nationalization of silver, this is temporary in the end. Without the premise of continuing to create new state-owned enterprises, it is absolutely difficult for the net profit of state-owned businesses to have such a figure every year as last year. Originally, in the draft budget for the 25th year, this net profit had been listed as 28 million yuan less than the previous year, but in order to seek the surface suitability of revenue and expenditure, it was still listed as more than 41.39 million yuan.</p>
<p>From the above, looking at the revenue side of the budget for the most recent 25th year, we have already discovered its three major defects. The first is the reduction of tax revenue, the second is the inflation of other revenue, and the third is the increase in debt revenue. Judging from these three points alone, it is enough to explain that recent finances are somewhat difficult to balance. Especially the increase in debt revenue not only indicates that recent finances cannot be balanced, but also implies that they are somewhat difficult to balance. Because the current increase in debt is implying that the future expenditure on debt service will be greater. Moreover, the conditions for issuing bonds in China in recent years have been very harsh. For example, from the 16th to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, a total of 113 million yuan of domestic debt was issued, but the government actually received only about 65 million yuan, which is about 57% of the face value. Such an improper issuance not only causes undue losses to most of the people, but also makes it difficult for finances to be balanced forever. In the past, more than 100 million yuan of public debt was issued, but before February of this year, the central finance still had a shortfall of 24 million to 27 million yuan per month. This is precisely to illustrate how much of a "putting the cart before the horse" measure is the public debt policy to adjust the financial imbalance.</p>
<p>In such extreme financial difficulties, the central government has begun a new balancing strategy, which is the forced exchange of public debt in February of this year, exchanging the 31 types of public debt issued in the past for five types of unified public debt, totaling 146 million yuan, extending the repayment period by an average of ten years. This reduces the annual expenditure on debt service and frees up some funds to issue new public debt. The main new public debt is the 340 million yuan of the Reconstruction Public Debt. The reason why the debt revenue in the budget for the 25th year is more than the previous two years is because the bond issuance fund is more settled. The Reconstruction Public Debt issued this year was originally said to be used for production undertakings and the completion of the legal tender policy, but according to news reports: "This public debt is not circulated in the market, nor is it sold publicly in the securities market. Most of it is deposited in the Central, China, and Communications banks as a guarantee to prepare for the issuance of banknotes. The central government has already overdrawn 150 million yuan from the banks in the past six months, and will need at least 150 million yuan in the next six months, totaling 300 million yuan. However, the Reconstruction Public Debt is issued at a discount of 98% of the face value, totaling about 310 million yuan, which is only enough for half a year after repaying the bank overdraft." (March 16, Beiping Morning Post) Thus it can be seen that the government does not want to give up the policy of balancing revenue and expenditure with public debt.</p>
<p>After the public debt consolidation in February of this year, the annual repayment of principal and interest on public debt can be reduced by about 40% compared to the figures before the consolidation in the first one or two years. The 40% fund that is reduced can at most issue another 67 million yuan of public debt. Now the Reconstruction Public Debt has been issued for more than 300 million yuan, plus the 15 million yuan of loan revenue in the budget for the 25th year (in reality, it must be more than this number). By next year, I am afraid that public debt will be difficult to issue again. Then, how will the public debt policy be used?</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Reading the 23rd Fiscal Year Financial Report</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Our nation's central finances, since the 18th year of the Republic, have been the subject of annual financial reports published by the Ministry of Finance. These reports aim to inform the people of the actual state of income and expenditure, serving as a basis for learning from the past and planning for the future. This intention is commendable. The situation for the 23rd year and subsequent periods has been released today, encompassing tens of thousands of words, meticulously categorized and analyzed. It details the difficult and turbulent financial situation of the past two years, along with the process of planning and reform. After reading it repeatedly, we deeply admire the authorities' ability to exert their utmost effort, summon their greatest courage, and overcome all difficulties, leading the finances towards gradual stability. Furthermore, the report's conclusion states, "What the government desires in terms of finance is not merely balancing income and expenditure, but also to make finance increasingly sound, enabling surplus resources to develop domestic economic resources and improve the people's lives." These few words are particularly pertinent. However, based on our review of the income and expenditure situation in the report, we believe that achieving this ideal state still faces obstacles and requires further efforts from the authorities. Please allow us to elaborate.</p>
<p>Traditionally, discussions on financial management emphasize "adjusting expenditure to match income." This principle of finance is undoubtedly true during times of peace and prosperity. However, when the nation faces difficulties and the economy declines, rigidly adhering to this principle can lead to numerous difficulties and even financial chaos. Recently, our nation's expenditures have been increasing annually, while income has not kept pace, resulting in persistent financial deficits. According to the financial report's figures, this situation was particularly pronounced in the 23rd year, with deficits reaching 20.8% of total net expenditures. However, a portion of this deficit was due to government investments, so the net shortfall was only around 13%, a decrease compared to the 22nd year. This phenomenon, in the current situation riddled with problems, may be a welcome sign. However, the ideal of balanced income and expenditure is still distant. We sincerely hope that the authorities can make further efforts in this regard, which would address the crux of China's financial problems.</p>
<p>How can we achieve balanced income and expenditure? The financial report outlines several principles for us, with the following three points related to finance itself: First, all unnecessary or unproductive expenditures should be reduced, with savings allocated to production and construction purposes. Second, tax officials should be selected and trained to increase administrative efficiency. Third, existing taxes should be reorganized and sound new taxes should be introduced to increase revenue without increasing the burden on the people. If these three principles can be implemented gradually over time, the resulting increase in tax revenue should make it easier to balance income and expenditure. However, this cannot be achieved overnight. While the current authorities' determination to reorganize finances is not limited to just balancing income and expenditure, we believe that seeking a balance between income and expenditure is the only essential goal for today's turbulent financial situation. Only by balancing income and expenditure can we then gradually implement other improvements, addressing urgent matters first and delaying less pressing ones, thus achieving twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The current imbalance between income and expenditure is indeed, as the financial report states, due to a sharp decline in tax revenue. This decline is partly due to external pressures, such as rampant smuggling, and partly due to the domestic economic downturn. This decrease in income, caused by both internal and external factors, cannot be reversed through financial policies in the short term. However, in a passive sense, the pressure on finances can be reduced by using financial policies, namely by "adjusting expenditure to match income." While adjusting expenditure to match income is not the ideal financial practice, it is a means of working diligently to overcome difficulties in the current situation of internal and external challenges. Therefore, we absolutely agree with the first half of the aforementioned first principle. However, we believe that the latter half, which states, "savings should be allocated to production and construction purposes," should be limited. Only those production and construction projects that cannot be delayed should be undertaken. If they can be delayed, they should not be pursued simply because there are surplus funds, thus saving financial expenditures and reducing future financial deficits. Furthermore, to achieve the goal of adjusting expenditure to match income and balancing income and expenditure, strict adherence to the financial budget is essential. As the financial report states, "A more effective budget system must be established to control various expenditures." This is also crucial today. If the budget is not effective, how can we hope to balance income and expenditure? For example, the income and expenditure for the 23rd year each exceeded the budget for that year by 103.1 million yuan and 11.3 million yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>In summary, we deeply believe that the authorities can achieve their ideal of finance through their utmost efforts. However, based on our limited understanding, achieving this ideal must begin with adjusting expenditure to match income, controlling income and expenditure, and achieving balance. Then, over time, gradual reforms can be implemented to restore finance to the correct path.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Facilitate Military Transport, Connecting Transportation Between Korea and Manchuria, All Korean Railways to be Managed by the South Manchuria Railway, Iron Bridges to be Built on the Tumen and Yalu Rivers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A landmark policy of removing the economic "border" between Korea and Manchuria and realizing a unified Korea-Manchuria has been decided in principle after the meeting between the Governor-General of South Korea and Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army on the Tumen River. Taking this opportunity, the issue of unifying the Korea-Manchuria Railway after entrusting the management of all national railways in Korea to the South Manchuria Railway is proceeding formally. Establishing the unification of the Korea-Manchuria transportation system is not only an important issue in economic terms but also in military terms. Therefore, from the sixth to the fourteenth year of Taisho, the South Manchuria Railway was entrusted with the construction and management of all national railways in Korea for this reason. During the Manchurian Incident, the South Manchuria Railway promised to manage 328.5 kilometers of Korean railways north of Chongjin and the two ports of Chongjin and Unggi, first realizing the unification of transportation between North Korea and "Manchukuo." Currently, Korea and Manchuria are responding to each other, and after the railways are fully connected, the "Manchukuo" government's so-called five-year plan for industrial construction, in addition to the three iron bridges currently connecting Manchuria and Korea on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, has decided to add several more lines, making Korea-Manchuria transportation even closer. At this time, following the precedent of past years, entrusting the management of all national railways in Korea to the South Manchuria Railway and realizing the unified management of the Korea-Manchuria Railway is becoming increasingly supported by the Kwantung Army and the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, it seems that the Korea-Manchuria authorities will begin concrete research in the future. (Alliance News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese and puppet authorities, seeing that the righteous army is active and emerges without warning on the Manchuria-Korea border, making "suppression" extremely difficult, have decided to implement Korea-Manchuria transportation connections. They will build a new iron bridge on the Yalu River between Andong and Shinuiju in Korea to facilitate transportation. The South Manchuria Railway Construction Bureau has been commissioned to survey the site, and construction is scheduled to begin in November of this year. The construction cost is 4 million yuan, and the project is expected to be completed within three years. Furthermore, the Korea-Manchuria border river bridge construction agreement stipulates that each party is responsible for 3 million yuan in construction funds, to be completed within seven years. The formal signing date for this agreement is reportedly scheduled for December 10 in Changchun. (China United News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Another New Japanese Destroyer Completed</h3>
<p>Osaka: The new Japanese Navy's cutting-edge first-class destroyer "Kawakaze" (1368 tons) held its launching ceremony at the Fujinaga Shipyard in Osaka at 8:30 AM on the 1st, with Governor Fujita of the Kure Naval District attending. This ship is the same type as the "Shiratsuyu" and "Shigure." Since construction began on February 1, 1934, its design has been changed several times due to the Tomozuru incident, etc. The destroyer's construction took two years and nine months, setting a new record. The ship has now been completed. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>National Assembly Opening Nears, Cabinet Faces Difficulties, Parliamentary System Reform Issue, Seeking to Ease Political Party Tensions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The government has resolved the difficult national electricity management proposal, the tax system reform proposal, and has also decided on a handling policy for administrative structure reform issues. Currently, only the budget formation problem remains unresolved. However, what the government has been most troubled by recently is the approaching opening of the next session of the National Assembly, which is expected to be fraught with issues, and the deteriorating relations with political parties. The government's greatest concern is the emergence of emotional opposition surrounding the issue of parliamentary system reform. The reform of the parliamentary system is a profound and significant issue with an ideological foundation. Depending on future developments, complex and subtle progress is inevitable. The government is very concerned about this. The government naturally adheres to the principle of respecting the parliamentary system and ensuring the free flow of public opinion, and will conduct reviews accordingly. There is absolutely no intention to reduce the powers of the National Assembly or deny the legalization of a cabinet based on political parties, as suggested by some within the Army Department. If the Army Department concretely expresses its opinions in the future, regardless of the government's intentions, it will inevitably further worsen the atmosphere among political parties, intensify their opposition, and ultimately affect other government proposals. Therefore, the government is very concerned about this point. In the future, it plans to use cabinet members from political parties or other methods to thoroughly convey the government's true intentions regarding parliamentary system reform in order to ease the emotions of the political parties.

<h3>Hartford Group Prays for Roosevelt's Defeat</h3>
<p>A group in Hartford, USA, calling itself the "Hartford Prayer Group," will begin an all-night prayer service starting at 10:00 PM on November 2nd, praying for President Roosevelt's failure to be elected and for divine assistance to "eternally stop the heresy of the New Deal." (National News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>US Election Campaign Ends, Differences and Similarities in the Platforms of the Two Major Parties, Roosevelt Delivers Final Speech</h3>
<p>(Washington) As the election campaign draws to a close, the platforms put forward by the Democratic and Republican parties differ not in their goals but in their means. Regarding issues such as providing relief for the unemployed, improving society, implementing public works, curbing trusts, controlling industry and commerce, and protecting individual freedoms and rights, either one party advocates for them, or the other party supports them to a considerable extent. They are not entirely incompatible.</p>
<p>Republican presidential candidate Landon's criticisms of the Roosevelt administration are particularly focused on the following five points: (1) unbalanced budget; (2) after the government established commercial agreements with fourteen countries, the domestic market has been occupied by foreign goods; (3) waste of national funds due to relief for the unemployed; (4) since the implementation of the government's current agricultural policy, it has been necessary to import foreign agricultural products to meet domestic needs; (5) the New Deal, especially the National Industrial Recovery Act, violates the Constitution.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt replied that (A) although the amount of national debt has increased, the situation has improved and is easier to bear than in 1932, before the Democratic Party came to power; (B) since the government established commercial agreements with various countries, the total value of exported goods has increased by $680,000,000 compared to 1932; (C) relief for the unemployed is urgent, and accurate statistics are not yet available, so it is inappropriate to criticize arbitrarily; (D) the reason why the United States imports foreign agricultural products is due to the devastation of fields and crops by droughts in the past two years, but the situation of farmers has indeed improved; (E) the current Constitution should correspond to actual needs. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt delivered his final election campaign speech at Madison Square Park today, strongly criticizing powerful figures in the country who are now trying to restore the best doctrine of a government that is fond of quietude and inaction. He said that this kind of force united to resist a presidential candidate is unprecedented in American history. These people are determined to make things difficult for him, and he particularly welcomes their dislike. He wants to hear people say that the selfish and power-hungry people in his first government have met their match, and he also wants to hear that in his second government, these people have surpassed their masters.</p>
<p>When delivering his speech today, President Roosevelt did not specify whether he would restore the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, but he broadly answered Republican candidate Landon's questions about the purposes of the New Deal measures, saying that its purposes were to reduce working hours, increase wages, end child labor, support collective bargaining, and promote mutually beneficial trade between countries. President Roosevelt continued, "We must continue to strive to achieve these goals because we have only just begun to build the nation." President Roosevelt also said that it is now time to continue to seek welfare for farmers. The government intends to do its best to stop the accumulation of huge surpluses in order to prevent the sharp decline in agricultural product prices. The government will also encourage farmer cooperation plans, crop insurance, and stable food supply. President Roosevelt concluded by saying, "There is war and much talk of war in the world today. We do not want to be involved in either. While protecting our own coasts, we will continue to eliminate the roots of domestic unrest and hostility, because these accidents easily make the people victims of those who seek private gain through foreign wars. All those who profit from war are not on our side in this election campaign."</p>
<p>The people who support President Roosevelt are mostly laborers and middle-class citizens, which seems to be inversely proportional to the fashionable Republicans who support Landon. When Roosevelt stood up and began his speech, the crowd cheered deafeningly. Roosevelt was very excited when he spoke, and the emotions of the audience were stirred. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>St. Louis: Republican presidential candidate Landon delivered his final campaign speech here today, saying that the absurd actions of the New Deal are sufficient to prevent a true recovery. The government wants to evade responsibility and has repeatedly broken its promises, resulting in a great loss of national confidence. Landon also summarized the current problems, saying that the New Deal completely avoids answering these questions. (National News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Election Predictions, Roosevelt Likely to Win, Both Parties Spend Vast Amounts on Campaigns</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Wall Street is betting two to one on President Roosevelt's victory. Republicans say that if the Pacific Coast shipping strike continues to spread, their candidate Landon may be able to win in the final hour. Observers now believe that if a temporary change occurs, as in 1934, President Roosevelt may lose the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. According to General Johnson, the former head of the National Recovery Administration, he has seen a confidential Republican report that predicts that President Roosevelt may win a small majority in Landon's own state of Kansas.</p>
<p>According to the official report received by the House of Representatives, the expenses for this presidential election will reach approximately 17 million yuan. The expenses used by the candidates and local party organizations have not yet been included. As of October 28, the funds spent by various groups campaigning for President Roosevelt had reached 4.14 million yuan, while the funds spent by various parties opposing Roosevelt had reached approximately 7.5 million yuan. It is expected that the opposing parties will spend another 5 million yuan before the vote on Tuesday next week. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Fleet Cruises the North Sea, Exercises Secret Navigation, Returns to Weymouth Port</h3>
<p>(London) The British Home Fleet, which has been conducting its annual cruise in the North Sea, has recently completed its mission and will return to Weymouth Port tonight. When passing through the Strait of Dover and the English Channel, all warships will turn off their lights to practice secret navigation. At the same time, the British Air Force will conduct reconnaissance along the coast to detect the traces of this "secret" fleet. The fleet was discovered when it reached the waters off Cape Gris-Nez (near Calais, France). (Havas News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>US Maritime Strike Spreads, Pacific Coast Shipping Paralyzed, Government Authorities Quickly Seek Solutions</h3>
<p>(New York) The International Seamen's Union convened a meeting today and resolved to support the strikers on the Pacific Coast by immediately announcing a strike. Therefore, there is a considerable risk that the US shipping industry will be completely paralyzed. Currently, as a result of the strike by more than 57,000 dockworkers on the Pacific Coast, shipping in that area has been completely paralyzed. No fewer than 150 ships have been suspended. New York, Baltimore, Providence, Boston, and other ports along the Atlantic coast have also expressed their intention to hold sympathy strikes. However, as of now, no strikes have been formally announced. Secretary of Labor Perkins has departed from Washington to New York in an attempt to stop the strike from spreading to the East Coast. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) Mayor Rossi of San Francisco, seeing that the number of ships canceling sailing dates has reached more than 200, announced martial law in the city today. At the same time, many ships parked elsewhere are also unable to sail. Fifty-seven ships in San Pedro, twenty-two in Seattle, twenty-four in Portland, thirty in San Diego, two in Honolulu, and cities in the Hawaiian Islands, Alaska, and the west coast of the United States will therefore experience a severe shortage of food. Today, another 1,400 people in Seattle began striking and conducting pickets, but no incidents occurred. The West Coast Timber Workers' Union announced that if the coastal strike is not resolved, all 20,000 timber workers from Bellingham to Coos Bay will also rise up in response within a few days. Today, 1,500 people in Portland are conducting peaceful pickets, while special police patrol the coast to maintain order. The National Farmers' Association Grain Association announced that the strike has spread inland, and almost all flour mills in Washington State have stopped operating. However, Pegler, the general manager of the New York branch of the International Seamen's Union, said that the union does not advocate sympathy strikes. San Diego also has more than 200 pickets today, patrolling various shipyards. Although the International Seamen's Union prohibits sympathy strikes, many workers in various places are resisting orders. (National News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) In the past twenty-four hours, the strike movement has spread across the country, so all federal government agencies here are making every effort to find a solution. The Postal Department is first considering borrowing ships from Canada and Japan to ensure that mail to the Far East can pass unhindered. Secretary of Labor Perkins is investigating the truth of the strike movement, and the Director of the Budget has been asked to approve funds to establish government-controlled seamen's referral agencies. The Federal Maritime Commission has also ordered Admiral Henley, commander of the coastal patrol, to continue investigating the underlying causes of the strike. (National News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) It is reported that housewives here, anticipating a shortage of food due to a strike by Pacific Coast seamen, purchased a lot of food last week. Generally speaking, there should be no shortage within a week. However, grocers said that if the food warehouse workers cannot resume work soon, the stores' inventory will be sold out.

<h3>Iraqi Parliament Dissolved, General Elections Scheduled, Former Prime Minister Expelled</h3>
<p>Reports indicate that the Iraqi government has issued an order dissolving parliament and scheduling general elections. The order was signed by the King, stating that the government and parliament should cooperate to allow the cabinet to implement its planned reforms. The cabinet believes that the current parliament is difficult to cooperate with, so the House of Representatives should be dissolved immediately and general elections scheduled. The Iraqi parliament is bicameral, with the Senate composed of twenty appointed elders and the House of Representatives composed of eighty-eight elected representatives. It was rumored yesterday that General Jafar, the former Minister of Defense who was shot, sometimes opposed Britain and sometimes supported it. At the beginning of the European War, he led Arabs to fight against Britain alongside the Turks. The former German Emperor therefore awarded him the Iron Cross. In 1916, he was captured by the British army and imprisoned in a fortress in Cairo. He escaped shortly thereafter. It was then heard that Turkey had killed many of his friends, prominent Arab nationalists. He joined the British army and led troops to land in the Gulf of Aqaba. Together with Faisal, the first King of Iraq and father of the current King, he convened Arab sympathizers to join forces with British commander Viscount Allenby to defend against the Turkish army, which was ultimately defeated. The British Emperor awarded him the Order of St. Michael and St. George for his merits. General Jafar subsequently held a powerful position in Iraqi politics. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Since the coup in Iraq, Baghdad has issued an order expelling former Prime Minister Yassin, former Foreign Minister Nuri, and former Interior Minister Rist from the country. It is said that for the sake of public security, the government could not but adopt this expulsion policy. It is heard that the three have fled to Syria. It is also heard that General Jafar, the Minister of Defense, was shot by political enemies yesterday. Jafar was a key figure in the previous cabinet and was supported by the pro-British faction. (National News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the coup in Iraq, many newspapers in Paris said that this may be due to German propaganda. Le Temps reported, "Britain, in order to stop expanding its armaments, is sparing no effort to lean towards Germany and Italy. This Iraqi incident is very detrimental to Britain and is not accidental. The serious incidents that have recently occurred between Britain and Japan are no different." Le Petit Parisien's correspondent in London claimed, "There is no doubt that there is a link between the incident in Palestine and the subsequent coup in Baghdad. The Arab nation has long resented Britain's policy of siding with the Jews, and Nazi Germany has been able to exploit this. Whether the coup in Iraq was due to German manipulation is a question that the general public is also asking." (Havas)</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Speech: Open Rejection of Four Matters; Acknowledging Peace Is Not Entirely Indivisible; Letting the League of Nations Tend Towards Demise</h3>
<p>Milan, Italy – Prime Minister Mussolini recently delivered an important speech at the Piazza del Duomo, stating roughly that the existing four matters are all illusory talk, and he rejects them all: (1) disarmament; (2) collective security; (3) the theory that peace is entirely indivisible, in other words, that war is indivisible; (4) the League of Nations. Since this organization has no hope of revival, from Italy's standpoint, it is better to let it die a natural death. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

Yesterday evening at 8:45 and 9:25, five or six more aircraft came again but did not drop bombs, only throwing down several packages of Nationalist Army newspapers. Last night, the moonlight was bright and the night was clear, which was conducive to air raids. The government army then began to resist and was very successful. Machine guns and anti-aircraft guns fired at the approaching aircraft, while sirens sounded to warn the public. All the lights in the city were extinguished within minutes, and most residents took refuge in cellars and other safe places. However, some busybodies still roamed the streets, and the police ordered them to walk in the dark. By 10:00 p.m., the enemy planes had flown away, and the city returned to normal. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Madrid – It has just been learned that at least 125 people died and 300 were injured during yesterday's Nationalist Revolutionary Army's air raid on the capital.

<h3>Non-Intervention Issue: Soviet Reply; Refuting Item by Item the Accusations of Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>(London) – Regarding the accusations by Italy and Germany that the Soviet government has violated the Spanish Civil War non-intervention agreement, the Soviet government sent out two notes on October 27 to refute them. The two notes were distributed to representatives of the countries attending the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Arrangement Adjustment Conference this week for study. When the Adjustment Committee meets next Wednesday, discussing these notes from the Soviet government will be its primary task. It is now learned that the Soviet government's first note refutes the accusations made by Italy. Italy accused the Soviet Union of violating the non-intervention agreement by supplying arms to the Madrid government, which was first raised by the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, at the Adjustment Committee meeting on October 9. Among them, it was said that 30 Soviet aircraft arrived in Barcelona, Spain, in mid-September. The Soviet note now refutes this, saying that Italy has not indicated the name of the ship carrying the aircraft, which shows that there is no factual basis. Moreover, no Soviet ships arrived in Barcelona in mid-September, which proves that Italy's accusations are slanderous. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Meets with the Ambassadors of Italy, Germany, and Belgium; Inquiring about Their Stance on the Locarno Conference; Much Deliberation on the Wording of the Italian Letter</h3>
<p>(Paris) – Foreign Minister Delbos held important talks with the German Ambassador to France, Count Welczek, the Belgian Ambassador to France, Count Kerchove de Denterghem, and the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, at the Foreign Ministry this afternoon. It is heard that what the Foreign Minister discussed with the ambassadors of Germany, Belgium, and Italy was mostly about the future of the Locarno Five-Power Conference. Earlier last month, King Leopold of Belgium issued a declaration advocating the restoration of a neutral status. Subsequently, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano visited Germany and held important talks with Führer Hitler. Afterward, Germany, Belgium, and Italy have decided on a new stance regarding the Locarno Conference. Therefore, Delbos specially invited the ambassadors of the three countries to inquire about it. In addition, the Spanish issue was also mentioned. Delbos also discussed the drafting of the letter of credence of the newly appointed French Ambassador to Italy, Saint-Quentin, with Italian Ambassador Cerruti. Italy requires that when the newly appointed French ambassador goes to Rome to take office, the letter of credence should state "His Majesty, King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia, Emmanuel." France believes that this title inevitably implies recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. Therefore, this issue is still under discussion. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Portuguese Prime Minister Explains Foreign Policy: Aiming at Self-Defense, Not Concerned with Other Matters; Maintaining Friendship with All Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal – The government sent more than 50,000 members of the National Union Party to hold a demonstration. Prime Minister Salazar then delivered a speech, stating roughly: "Our party's recently implemented foreign policy plan has achieved victory. On the one hand, we have maintained the original friendship with all allied nations, and on the other hand, we have gained the sympathy and respect of all countries. We are not unmoved by the suffering felt by Spain. We are guilty of our recent diplomatic actions (referring to the severance of diplomatic relations), but the situation has reached a final juncture. Cautious hesitation is cowardly and shameless. Greater tolerance is harmful to our national dignity. Fortunately, all countries except the Soviet Union agree with what we have done. We have never hindered the interests of our country, nor have we ever hindered the interests of our allied nations and human civilization. Those who want to accuse us often say that the Iberian Peninsula must maintain democracy. We dare not believe it deeply. We must continue to defend ourselves, and we are not concerned with other matters." At this point, Prime Minister Salazar asked the audience, "Can you support the government's implementation of this policy with loyalty and even sacrifice your lives?" The audience responded with enthusiastic cheers, shouting "Yes, yes" three times. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Lindbergh's Transatlantic Flight; Tenth Anniversary Next Year; French Aviation Department Decides to Hold; New York-Paris Air Race</h3>
<p>(Paris) – The famous American aviator Major Lindbergh flew solo across the Atlantic Ocean from America to Paris in 1927. Next year marks the tenth anniversary of this event. The French Aviation Department has decided to hold a New York-to-Paris air race to commemorate Major Lindbergh's great achievement. Aviation Minister Guito recently made a statement to a reporter from the Hardliner News on this matter, saying, "In order to encourage domestic and foreign individuals to participate in this competition, the government has decided to establish four prizes: a first prize of 1.5 million francs, a second prize of 1 million francs, a third prize of 500,000 francs, and a fourth prize of 300,000 francs. France plans to form at least three teams to participate in the competition. The first team will be composed of the famous aviators Rossi and Codos (who departed from New York on August 7, 1933, flew across the Atlantic Ocean and traversed the European continent, reaching Rayak, Syria, covering 9,104.7 kilometers, setting a world record for direct-distance flight). The second team plans to have General Poumège fly a plane on behalf of the French Air Force to participate in the competition. As for the third team, the French airline will select the best pilot, mechanic, and radio operator to form it. Generally speaking, the famous aviator Mermoz (who has made multiple flights on the Paris-South American Brazil route) will be chosen as the pilot. As for the preparation of the competition and the matching of aircraft engines, the task should be entrusted to experts in long-distance flight, such as the famous aviator Costes (Costes once flew directly from Paris to Qiqihar and also flew across the Atlantic Ocean from east to west)."

<h3>Situation in North China Suddenly Turns Tense; Kwantung and North China Army Headquarters Have New Decisions; Will Stir Up Trouble Using the Taiyuan and Zhong Company Incident</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent – The situation in North China has suddenly shifted from calm to tense after a staff officer, Kazuchi, from the Tianjin-based Japanese Garrison Army Headquarters went to Changchun on the 28th of this month to meet with the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Itagaki, to exchange opinions. On the Suiyuan front, more than 500 troops from the puppet army of Li Shouxin were discovered on the 28th attacking the vicinity of Doufuyiaozi in Qingyi Township, northeast of Xinghe County. After a fierce battle of half a day, our army reinforcements repelled the puppet troops. However, the two bandit gangs of Wang Ying and Jin Jiasan are still lurking near Shangdu. The situation is not optimistic. Zhao Chengshou, seeing the urgency of the border situation, rushed back to Jining from Datong on the evening of the 29th and went to the forward defense on the 30th for inspection. Although it is difficult to predict when the bandit army will attack, the outbreak of war is imminent.</p>
<p>The defense of Suiyuan is mainly managed by Fu Zuoyi, which is quite promising. A certain party is also slightly wary and has recently been devising a strategy. They feel that they should cut off the connection between Jin and Sui and contain the Jin army from reinforcing the north. Therefore, they are considering taking action in Taiyuan, so that the Jin authorities have no time to look north and allow them to do as they please in eastern Suiyuan. This plan has now been obtained, namely, the sudden outbreak of the Taiyuan Japanese and Zhong Company incident on the 26th of this month. The Japanese Army Headquarters declared that it would engage in self-defense and resolutely punish. The cause of the incident is that a Japanese resident, Tanaka Yoshitaro, and a Japanese without a passport, Takeda Sueo, established a smuggling trading company and engaged in drug trafficking called the Hezhong Company at No. 1 Shandong Alley, Taiyuanfang, Taiyuan City. The Public Security Bureau's crackdown was ineffective. In late September, the Xieshan Hospital, next door to the company, relocated. The hospital director, Wang Junde, without the landlord's permission, transferred the site to Tanaka for the expansion of the company. The landlord did not agree and filed a lawsuit with the Shanxi District Court. The lawsuit was won and the landlord took back the house. However, Tanaka refused to leave and filed a complaint with the head of the Taiyuan Special Service Agency, Kawano, and the secretary of the consular branch, Nishi, and the chief of the police branch, Uetsuma. Kawano then protested to the Jin Sui Office. As of October 26, the matter had not been resolved. The citizens were indignant when they learned of this and were about to express their displeasure. The Taiyuan Public Security Bureau, fearing accidents, allocated more than ten soldiers to guard the Hezhong Company and the vacant Xieshan houses and sent Tanaka's accomplice Takeda to Zhengzhou. Kawano said that this was anti-Japanese and insulted overseas Chinese, and reported it to Tianjin. The Japanese Army Headquarters held a special meeting on the evening of the 28th. On the afternoon of the 29th, Kazuchi visited Consul General Horiuchi stationed in Tianjin to discuss opinions. Horiuchi was trying to expand the police power in North China and wanted to set up a deputy consulate and a police station in Taiyuan, but had repeatedly negotiated with the Jin authorities without results. He took this opportunity to discuss with Kazuchi. In addition to the Japanese Army Headquarters sending a telegram to Kawano to file a serious protest with the Jin Sui Office, the consulate sent four patrolmen on the 30th, led by Section Chief Sekikawa and Police Inspector Ura, and several police branch officers and officials, planning to expand the police station in the name of protecting overseas Chinese after arriving in Taiyuan. The Japanese Army Headquarters, in order to achieve its goals, deliberately released the air that the lives of overseas Chinese in Taiyuan were in danger, and was a latent threat for expanding the scope. In fact, there are a total of thirty-four Japanese and Korean people in Taiyuan. They all moved to Takahashi's residence on the 28th. The Jin authorities are doing their best to protect them, and the public has no anti-Japanese facts. Life and property are as safe as ever, which is not as bad as the Japanese side is spreading. Their intentions are far-reaching and have other purposes. Although our protection is thorough, it is difficult to prevent the expansion of the issue itself. (30th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Japanese Military Exercise; Regiment Against Regiment War; Taking Beiping as a Hypothetical Target of Attack; Encounter Battle and Night Battle on the 30th; Gunfire Raged and Emotions Were Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondent - The autumn exercises of the Japanese garrison in North China, which have been underway since the 26th, were completed on the 28th after individual regimental exercises. There was a one-day rest on the 29th. On the 30th, three days of regimental-against-regimental exercises continued, with the 1st Regiment stationed in Ping and the 2nd Regiment stationed in Tianjin and Tong as the main force. More than 400 soldiers, artillery, and others from the infantry of the 1st Regiment stationed in Ping carried 7 large and small tanks, 20 heavy trucks loaded with military supplies, and 4 motorcycles, departing from the Japanese barracks in Dongjiaominxiang at 5:30 a.m. on the 30th, passing through Qianmen, out of Yongdingmen, crossing the southern suburbs, and heading towards Anding. Another 400 or more infantry soldiers and 30 or more cavalry soldiers from the Japanese army stationed in Ping also left the barracks on foot at the same time, carrying more than ten large carts loaded with food, passing through You'anmen, crossing the southern suburbs, and also going to Anding. Together with more than 800 Japanese soldiers from the 1st Regiment stationed in Fengtai, there were about 1,700 people, gathering near Sihezhuang and Zhangzhuangchang. At the same time, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers from the 2nd Regiment stationed in Tianjin and Tongxian also departed from Langfang and Tongxian around 6:00 a.m. on the 30th and arrived at Longjiafang and Hejiafen on the Tongxian border to gather. At 9:00 a.m., the two regiments mobilized at the same time for counter-exercises. At about 10:00 a.m., they encountered each other in the Dahungcun and Majuqiao area, fighting an encounter battle. For a time, gunfire raged and emotions were extremely tense, taking Beiping as a hypothetical target of attack. The two sides tried their best to attack and resist, and stalemate until 5:00 p.m. The Japanese troops from Tianjin and Tongxian finally retreated eastward, and the Japanese troops from Pingfeng also followed them forward, and then ended, camping and having dinner in Mazhuang and Saoziying. Starting at 9:00 p.m., they continued the night battle until 12:00 p.m. On the morning of the 31st, they continued counter-exercises in the northeastern area of Saoziying and camped overnight in Xiaogaozhuang and Sujiafen. On November 1st, they continued counter-exercises in the same place. During these three days, the counter-exercises of the Japanese 1st and 2nd Regiments were led by Regiment Commanders Mutaguchi and Kayashima, and conducted under the command of Brigade Commander Kawabe. The regimental counter-exercises ended on the evening of the 1st, and Beiping was assumed to have been occupied by the attacking army. On the 2nd, they all gathered in Tongxian. At that time, Japanese Commander-in-Chief Tashiro went to Tongxian from Tianjin to inspect and direct the Japanese army to conduct exercises from Tongxian to Beiping. Early on the morning of the 3rd, it was planned to have 600 Japanese soldiers enter Chaoyangmen, pass through Ping City, exit Fuchengmen, and go straight to the western suburbs for exercises. This action also meant that Beiping had been occupied by the attacking army. Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army Headquarters Qiaoben Qun arrived in Ping from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 30th and went to Tongxian to arrange everything. On the 3rd, there was a large-scale exercise in the western suburbs all day long, with the division headquarters participating, involving about 7,000 people. On the morning of the 4th, it was inspected by Tashiro at Babaoshan and related personnel were invited to visit. When the Japanese army held large-scale exercises in the western suburbs, our army stationed in Xiyuan will also organize a team to visit. During the period of large-scale exercises by the Japanese army, the people showed a lot of anxiety. Those who are nervous have already purchased grain and stored rice to prepare for unexpected events. (30th)</p>
<h3>Illegal Merchants Transporting Grain Out of the Province; Hebei Province Citizens Fear a Food Shortage; Flour and Rice Prices Soaring Rapidly; Certain Factions Extensively Purchasing Rice to Supply Military Provisions</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Each county in Hebei Province fortunately had a bumper harvest this year. The people were celebrating the ample food supply, and expecting grain prices to fall. However, contrary to expectations, the prices of flour and rice have soared relentlessly. The public food supply issue has triggered immense panic. The reasons for this are summarized below:</p>
<p>Public Food Supply Panic</p>
<p>An investigation into the food supply in Hebei Province reveals that, apart from flour, which has traditionally relied on shipments from Shanghai merchants, other grains are mostly supplied by the various counties. However, the source of these grains has almost been cut off in recent times. When available for sale, market prices are about one and a half times higher than in the past. Green-label flour from the Qianyi Company in this province, which used to sell for only three yuan and five jiao, has now risen to four yuan and five jiao. Other red, blue, and yellow-label flours have also increased by seven or eight jiao each. As for Shanghai flour, it has risen to five yuan and is still unavailable. Rice costs sixteen yuan per bag, while locally-produced Fuji rice is also fourteen yuan and five jiao. The highest-grade Saigon rice has surged to around nineteen yuan per bag. Even the lowest grade of high-grade Min Dang rice cannot be purchased for less than fourteen yuan. Other grains such as sorghum, mung beans, and wheat have each risen by two or three jiao. The general populace is filled with worry, leading to widespread panic. The weather has turned severely cold recently, which has a critical impact on social order. Although farmers in the countryside have had a bountiful autumn harvest themselves, much of their produce was bought up by rice and flour merchants at low prices early on. Now they can only watch as they lose out on substantial profits. Moreover, they still have to buy back grain at higher prices, suffering losses and lamenting their helplessness.</p>
<p>Reasons for Price Increases</p>
<p>This province was originally the most developed agricultural area. This year's bumper harvest should have prevented a food supply panic, however: (1) Major farmers, seeing the instability of the times, are buying and storing rice and flour, and refusing to sell their own grain. (2) Small farmers rely solely on their annual grain production to purchase clothing and supplies. They sell off most of their harvested grain, causing them to feel the pinch of food shortage. (3) Flour companies and major grain merchants bought up most of the agricultural produce at low prices before the autumn harvest. (4) Unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate market prices. (5) Certain factions have sent people to various places to purchase large quantities of grain and rice to supply military provisions. (6) Illegal merchants are transporting grain out of the province on a large scale. All of these factors have caused a great panic over the food supply in this province. The lower and middle classes, in particular, are feeling insecure. (October 31)</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of the Yellow River's Calm Waters in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces; Kong Xiangrong Leads River Workers in Sacrificing to Yu the Great; A Three-Province River Defense Conference Continues After the Celebration</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River flows through nine provinces and has historically been a source of disasters. Breaches and overflows have occurred frequently, causing particularly severe damage. Since Kong Xiangrong, the Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, has been in charge of affairs, he has successfully closed breaches three times at Fenglou, Guantai, and Dongzhuang. This year, the Yellow River's water level rose, with a flow rate exceeding 17,000 cubic meters per second, a record-breaking volume. Through Kong's efforts, together with all the personnel of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the chairmen of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, and the heads of the river affairs bureaus, as well as tireless round-the-clock efforts by the workers, the situation was turned from danger to safety, averting breaches. This is truly a great fortune for the country and its people. To commemorate the Yellow River's calm waters and encourage future efforts, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the authorities of the three provinces jointly initiated the Grand Celebration of the Yellow River's Calm Waters in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces, held in Jinan. At the same time, a three-province river construction and defense conference was convened to determine Yellow River construction and defense measures, with the aim of preparing in advance and ensuring lasting calm. Due to the significant importance of the conference, representatives from various regions arrived in Jinan to participate and offer congratulations. The commemorative gifts sent were dazzling. At 8:00 AM, Kong Xiangrong and Wang Kairu, the Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, along with personnel from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the River Affairs Bureau, went to the Great King Temple on the banks of the Luokou River to offer sacrifices to Yu the Great and past sages who had governed the river. At 12:00 noon, the Calm Waters Celebration was held at the Jinde Assembly Hall. Participants included Han Fuqu, the Chairman of Shandong Provincial Government; Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Commission; Jiang Kanghu, a Doctor of Sociology; Zheng Zhaojing, the representative of the Economic Commission; Qin Fen, the Secretary-General representing Tang Qiyu; Du Yuliu, the representative of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and the Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau; Wang Liren, the representative of the Henan Provincial Government and the Director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau; Zhu Guangcai, the Secretary-General's representative; Liu Xiaoying, the representative of the National Economic Commission's Water Conservancy Association; Liang Chaoyu, the representative of the North China Water Conservancy Commission; Wang Kairu, the Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau; as well as various Shandong division commanders, regiment commanders, provincial party committee members, heads of various agencies, representatives of various organizations, representatives of people from various counties, and personnel from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, totaling no less than a thousand people. Hundreds of plaques, couplets, silver shields, and silver tripods were displayed. After the meeting, photos were taken, meals were shared, and theatrical performances were held. Each attendee was given a commemorative medal. At 6:00 PM, Han Fuqu and Kong Xiangrong hosted a banquet for the representatives at the Jinde Assembly Hall, with enthusiastic atmosphere and a grand occasion. It is said that next year's Calm Waters Celebration will be held in Hebei, and the year after that in Henan. Today (31st), after the Calm Waters Celebration concludes, the three-province river defense conference will continue tomorrow (2nd).</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Plan to Establish a Branch in Baoding; Police Officer Men Guan Sent to Baoding to Survey Locations; Future Plans Also Include Establishing One in Cangzhou</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Baoding is the most important town south of Beiping on the Pinghan Railway Line. After the Hebei Provincial Government moved from Tianjin last year, the political center of Hebei Province also moved here. Moreover, North China diplomacy is currently unfolding in stages. The Japanese side is paying increasing attention to Hebei Province's military and political facilities. Therefore, since Baoding was changed to the provincial capital, many Japanese have come to Baoding to engage in various activities, especially inspection groups from various industrial and commercial enterprises, who invariably visit Baoding first before proceeding to other counties. In order to foster friendly relations, the Provincial Government is responsible for properly taking care of all Japanese entering the province for activities, and has instructed the county governments to provide effective protection whenever Japanese arrive in the county. In the past year, although there have been occasional incidents of illegal elements such as Korean vagrants attempting to traffic drugs and establish gambling dens in various counties, the local governments have used peaceful means to try to suppress and prevent them. Fortunately, no disputes have occurred. The Provincial Government has also hired two Japanese advisors specifically to handle local minor issues. However, since the Japanese garrison in North China held autumn military exercises, the scale of which was large, the region wide, the number of people numerous, and using the simulated occupation of Beiping as a standard, local residents have felt apprehensive. Although Baoding is not within the scope of the exercises, due to its close proximity, people are also extremely alarmed. Unexpectedly, yesterday a Japanese military aircraft flew from the Northeast, flew low over the city of Baoding several times, and reconnoitered for more than ten minutes, further increasing people's unease. Following this, today the Beiping Japanese Police Department sent police officer Men Guan from Beiping to Baoding, with the aim of establishing a police branch in Baoding. It is said that the Japanese side is using the pretext of protecting Japanese residents and preventing illegal activities by Japanese and Korean vagrants to establish a police branch in Baoding. After arriving in Baoding, Men Guan immediately investigated the market conditions and surveyed locations for the future establishment of the branch, in order to report back to Beiping. Regarding the matter of Japanese police establishing a branch in Baoding, it is said that the Japanese Police Department has formally notified the Hebei-Chahar authorities and the Hebei Provincial Government. It is also said that the Japanese side plans to establish police branches not only in Baoding, but also in Tongzhou and Cangzhou. The Tongzhou branch was established long ago. After Baoding is established, plans for Cangzhou will be considered. However, although Baoding is the capital of Hebei Province, there are very few Japanese merchants who come here. This move by the Japanese side is unnecessary, and only adds to the already heavy anxiety of the local residents. (October 31)</p>
<h3>Anhui Local Bank Establishes a Southeast Financial Network; Direct Remittances with Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Fujian; Exchange and Circulation of Subsidiary Coinage</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The construction and development of resources in the southeastern transportation provinces have progressed rapidly in recent years. Villages on the brink of collapse due to emptiness are gradually reviving. Business in various towns and cities is also becoming more prosperous. However, many construction plans still need to be continued. Therefore, the need for economic support is also very urgent. In view of this, Anhui Provincial Local Bank, in order to mutually promote economic ties with neighboring provinces and promote economic construction, has initiated the establishment of a financial network for the southeastern provinces. Starting with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Anhui provinces. Once the initial stage has been successful, the scope will be expanded. Anhui Provincial Local Bank has separately agreed with the local banks of the above four provinces on financial liaison measures to implement mutual remittances and the exchange and circulation of subsidiary coinage in each province. The procedures are not only simple, but the remittance fees are also low. All banks are committed to serving local interests and mutually promoting the full economic development of each province. Today, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces are the first to start remittances. Anhui includes the Wuhu Head Office, Anqing, Bengbu, Tunxi Branch Offices, and 34 county offices. The remittance locations in Zhejiang Province include (Head Office) Hangzhou, (Branch Offices) Shanghai, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Haimen, Lanxi, Wenzhou, (Offices) Haining, Yuhang, Xiaoshan, Jiashan, Pinghu, Tongxiang, Changxing, Nanxun, Shuanglin, Xinshi, Sian, Fenghua, Zhenhai, Shengxian, Shangyu, Huangyan, Cixi, Yuyao, Jinhua, Ninghai, Linhai, Quzhou, Longyou, Ruian, Lishui, Zhuji, Jiande, Chongde, Shipu, Wenling, Aojiang, and other places. Remittances with Jiangsu, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces will be implemented as soon as agreements are signed. In addition, economic relations will be established with Guangdong Province to facilitate the transportation and sale of products. Because the provincial government is planning to mutually exchange Anhui rice and Guangdong sugar in order to consume domestic products. If the banks of the two provinces are successfully connected, the exchange method may be realized as soon as possible. In addition, the 120+ provincial and county agricultural warehouses established by the provincial government for the storage, pledging, transportation, and sale of rice and grain are under vigorous construction, and nearly 40% are now complete. In addition to Quanjiao and Langxi counties, which have already loaned out more than 60,000 yuan, the agricultural warehouses in Wuhu, Xuancheng, Dangtu, and Chaoxian counties, which have the largest capacity, will soon be lent out separately, and will handle the storage, pledging, transportation, and sale of rice and grain.

<h3>Near Qingdao, the Yisheng Steamer Collides with a Sailboat; Total Losses Estimated at Around 6,000 Yuan; Negotiations for Compensation are Currently Underway</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Zhang Tingqin, a resident of Huangdao, runs a shipping business. He owns a sailboat, thirteen feet in length, and employs Liu Zengli from Xuejiadao as a sailor. They travel back and forth between Qingdao and Haixi. On the morning of the 30th, at around 9:00 AM, they were carrying twelve passengers and their luggage when they sailed from Huangdao to this port. Due to the excessive waves at sea, the sailboat's rudder malfunctioned. They originally sailed from Huangdao to Xiaogang, but were blocked by the wind. The boat changed direction and sailed straight towards the west side of the wireless radio station on Tuandao. At that time, the Yisheng steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which had come from Shanghai to Qingdao, had rounded Tuandao and was sailing along the sea route to the Dagang Wharf. Because the steamer was traveling very fast, it met the sailboat on the west side of the radio station. Unable to avoid a collision in time, the two boats collided, and the sailboat was completely destroyed. The cabin immediately filled with water, and the fourteen passengers and sailors fell into the sea. Cries for help were heard everywhere. Seeing that an accident had occurred, the crew of the Yisheng steamer immediately lowered a lifeboat and rescued the passengers to safety. The destroyed sailboat was towed to Dagang and docked at the first wharf. However, all the goods and money and luggage carried by the passengers had been washed away by the water. The total loss is estimated at more than 6,000 yuan. The passengers and the owner of the boat, together with the person in charge of the Yisheng steamer (an Englishman), went to the maritime affairs section of the port authority to request handling of the matter. Li Shiyi and others, who were elected as representatives by the passengers, are responsible for negotiating with the Yisheng steamer for compensation for the losses.</p>
<h3>Songjiang; Four Suspects Apprehended in Sijing</h3>
<p>Patrol officers from the Fifth Police Substation in Sijing apprehended four suspects of a certain kind, named Shi Guoyuan, Fa Jing, Xu Wenjing, and Hong Jingshui, on the night of the 31st. They were jointly escorted to the county bureau on the 1st for interrogation and further investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan; Banning the Production of Bamboo Chip Tokens</h3>
<p>Shops in remote towns in this county often have capital shortages and poor turnover, so they privately produce bamboo chip tokens for circulation among the people, disrupting the financial order. The county government has obtained approval to issue a ban. It has been learned that the Xintai Fish Shop in Jinjiazhuang in the Fifth District is also producing bamboo chip tokens, divided into 500-wen and 1,000-wen denominations. After being discovered by the county government, the Public Security Bureau has been ordered to investigate and deal with the matter, and to recover and destroy the tokens within a specified period.</p>
<h3>Wuxi; Organizing a Waterborne Baojia System</h3>
<p>Zhang Da, the Director of the Public Security Bureau in this county, in addition to actively handling the establishment of police administrative districts, has also taken note of the fact that there are numerous rivers and streams in this county, and waterborne theft cases occur from time to time. The original water patrol team has limited police force, and patrols and arrests are often inadequate. Therefore, he has ordered the various branch bureaus to transfer 20 police cadets to the control of Song Tao Wei, the captain of the water patrol team, who is responsible for organizing a waterborne baojia system. In addition, four police stations will be established in important ports, and detective squads will be added to specifically investigate and arrest waterborne thieves in order to maintain security.</p>
<h3>Standardizing Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Since the new weights and measures system in this county has been promoted by the county government, Qin Hemen, the inspector, has been conducting inspections of various industries and shops in the urban area. This has now been completed. Merchants and the people can faithfully implement the new system. However, the situation in the rural areas is not consistent, so it is necessary to actively promote and earnestly inspect. Qin has decided to proceed to the various districts and towns from November 16th to continue the work, so that business practices will not be inconsistent, and the new system can be standardized. The county government has separately ordered the various districts and public security bureaus to assist in the implementation in advance. In addition, all old instruments used in the rice, bean, and miscellaneous grain industries will be abolished and replaced with the new system.</p>
<h3>Changshu; Murder of a Child in Zhenmen Temple</h3>
<p>A child murder case occurred yesterday at the Zhenmen Temple in Meili in the Second District. The murderous mother has been arrested and sent to the county government for investigation and handling. Xue Er, a resident of Xuejiajiao in that area, was a laborer in a cloth factory. Last year, he became unemployed and unable to make a living, so he resorted to theft. His mother, Ms. Xu, repeatedly taught him, but to no avail. The day before yesterday, Xue went to the home of Tang Pei, a tax collector, to steal, but was caught. Tang hated him and sent him to his mother, instructing her to kill him. Ms. Xu was temporarily deceived by Tang and tied up her son with a rope and beat him to death on the spot with a wooden hammer. His head was broken, his brains burst, and the scene was extremely tragic. The matter was reported to the township head, who reported it to the county for investigation. An official was dispatched on the 31st to verify that the incident was true and arrested the murderous mother, Ms. Xu, to await trial in the county.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou; Epidemics are Prevalent in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>The weather in Jiangbei this year, from spring to autumn, has been abnormal, resulting in particularly numerous epidemics, such as black fever, malignant malaria, and diphtheria. In addition, since entering autumn, it has not rained for two months, so winter wheat and barley cannot be planted. People feel very uneasy. Coupled with frequent fires and a lack of drinking water, the autumn sun has been very strong for days. It is rumored that locusts are very active in the Huaibei area. It is rare to see locusts in late autumn like this. The future is really worrying.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou; More Than Ten Passenger Boats Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>More than ten passenger boats moored in the river east of Hanliuzhuang in the Donghui Town of the Second District of this county were coveted by bandits. Before dawn on the 29th, more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived, armed with guns, and searched and robbed the boats separately. Fortunately, the residents of the village and farmers from nearby villages learned of the bandit alarm and fired guns to demonstrate, and the bandits, fearing trouble, hurriedly fled with the loot. The losses were not great.</p>
<h3>Rice Mills are Purchasing Rice from Other Ports</h3>
<p>The price of rice in this county is more than five yuan per shih. In view of the minimal profits, rice merchants are going to Wuhu, Changzhou, and other places to purchase rice. It is said that it is several jiao cheaper per shih than in this county. Although the shipping costs are higher, the profits are also substantial.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou; Silkworm Cocoon Loan of 600,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silkworm Silk Control Committee, in order to improve the silkworm cocoon baking equipment of cocooneries in various counties, has conducted a loan of 600,000 yuan for cocoon baking to the China Farmer's Bank and the Zhejiang Local Bank. After several discussions, the two banks have agreed, and a draft contract has also been drawn up. The two banks will each bear 300,000 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 9%, to be repaid within the year from 1937. The collateral is the operating income and all property of the cocooneries receiving the loans, and the Silkworm Silk Control Committee will provide a second guarantee. The formal contract will be signed with the banks before the cocooneries bake the silkworm cocoons, and interest will accrue from that day.</p>
<h3>Huzhou; Police Arrest a Opium Offender</h3>
<p>The Nanjie Police Station of the city's Public Security Bureau received a report at 3:00 PM on the 30th that Yu Maotou, at No. 41 Xiaohetou, was smoking opium. Upon receiving the report, police chief Qiu Zitian dispatched police officers who found the opium paraphernalia and arrested Yu Maotou and transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo; Ming Dynasty Cannon Unearthed for Coastal Defense</h3>
<p>Xinpu Yan, in Yuyao, is located on the coast and was the site where General Qi Jiguang of the Ming Dynasty stationed troops to suppress Japanese pirates. It is rumored that there was a cannon submerged in the river there (now the north end of the Xinpu Temple). Gu Yian, the captain of the Xinpu Yan Guard Team, believing that the river was dry at this time and excavation would be easier than usual, ordered all the team members to dig in the river on the 28th. After a while, the cannon was indeed found. The surrounding people came to watch. The cannon's bore was more than one foot in diameter, and although it had been submerged for a long time, it was still awe-inspiring. It has now been transported to the team headquarters and will be cleaned and mounted in a nearby strategic location for observation.</p>
<h3>Haizhou; Appealing for Postponement of House Tax</h3>
<p>The First Branch of the Guanyun County Public Security Bureau recently obeyed orders to investigate the shops and residential houses of merchants and residents in order to provide a basis for future collection of house tax. The merchants and residents of shops and residential houses throughout the city are worried about increased burdens and have collectively appealed to the County Chamber of Commerce, various township offices, and various industry associations to request a postponement of the tax. The chamber and associations believe that the coastal areas suffered from floods last year, and agricultural land was submerged. The planting season was missed, and the wheat harvest this year was meager. Moreover, the dredging of the river lasted for half a year, and the people's strength was exhausted. The people's livelihoods in the entire county are on the verge of bankruptcy. It goes without saying that the urban residents are especially reliant on the salt industry for their livelihood. This year, not only was the spring salt harvest lost, but transportation and sales have also stagnated, making life difficult. House prices have fallen. On the surface, the residents' houses look magnificent, but in reality they cannot afford to eat or wear clothes. If the house tax is implemented again, where will the people be placed? Under these special circumstances, we can only ask the government to give the people a chance to recuperate and wait for the social situation to improve before implementing the house tax. This seems to be considerate of both the situation and the law. Therefore, the County Chamber of Commerce, the various township offices, and the various industry associations have jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance and the county government and other relevant agencies, requesting approval to temporarily postpone the collection of taxes in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Cherry Tree Blossoms in Autumn</h3>
<p>Cherry trees bloom in March and April. Now it is autumn, and the leaves have fallen, and the branches have withered. However, a cherry tree planted in the backyard of the First District Office in Guanyun County recently sprouted leaves first, and then bloomed flowers, which are as brilliant as in spring.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football League Group A: Tung Wah Defeats Portugal; Result 6-0, Portuguese Team's Strength Ordinary</h3>
<p>This week in the Western Union Football League, due to the simultaneous start of the Scott Cup and Junior Cup, only three Group A matches were played. French Commercial, Lux, and Soquel were all idle. Therefore, the overall situation, apart from Tung Wah's leading position remaining unshaken, the second position of French Commercial has been surpassed by Lancashire by one point, and Portugal's position has also been taken by the Western Police team. St. Francis and Western Commercial have sequentially fallen behind. Soquel and Jinan, due to no matches, naturally remained unchanged. Among the matches, St. Francis's 1-4 loss to the Western Police team, although victory or defeat was expected, the difference of three goals was probably unexpected by St. Francis. Since its appearance, the Western Police team has been mediocre, but the old saying that the Western Police team gets stronger every year may be starting here. As for Lancashire's farewell memorial, only winning 4-0 against Western Commercial, it seems they have not yet exerted their full strength. Yesterday, Tung Wah defeated Portugal 6-0 at home. The Portuguese team's key players, Collaco and Costa, did not play, and their strength was ordinary. In the Scott Cup preliminary round, only two matches were played this week. French Commercial and Lux have both advanced to the second week, while Soquel and Jewish have been eliminated.</p>

<p>Lancashire Wins Lux (Reserves) 6-1</p>
<p>The match between Tung Wah and Portugal was held yesterday at Recreation Ground, with hundreds of spectators. As a result, Tung Wah won 6-0, with three goals in each half, surpassing the 4-1 victory in the previous friendly match. Referee He Chunhui was unable to attend due to circumstances, and the league temporarily found a replacement. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Cheung Wing Choi</p>
<p>Li Ning Li Yee Chen</p>
<p>Koo Sheung Yeung Fung Yau Chan Chun Wo</p>
<p>Wan Cheung Wah Suen Shun Tai Lun King Hui Man Kwai Ka Yau Leung</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>Collins</p>
<p>Gonsalves Weekes</p>
<p>Roliz Sheffield Soares</p>
<p>Andrade J. Rocha L. H. Soares L. Rocha L. Lopes</p>
<p>First Half: Yesterday morning, there was light rain. Recreation Ground was still able to proceed as usual due to the better field conditions. However, when the two teams lined up, drizzle was still falling. As a result of the coin toss, Tung Wah attacked first. After a few rounds, the Portuguese team launched a large-scale attack, but fortunately, the defense was extremely solid, and there was no need to worry about crossing the line. Although Tung Wah had several good opportunities, they ultimately failed due to the lack of coordination in the front line. Iron-legged Suen Kam Shun was also unable to display his strengths, while the Rocha brothers and Andrade of the Portuguese side frequently appeared in Tung Wah's territory, causing waves of shock in the defense. The intensity of the Portuguese attack and the frequent missed opportunities by Tung Wah made the audience feel dim. After about thirty minutes of stalemate, both sides still maintained their virgin status. Until Fung Wan Yau obtained the ball from the center line and made a high pass to the enemy's territory, Wan Cheung Wah passed to the center line, Ka Yau Leung hooked backwards, and Hui Man Kwai broke through, finally breaking the stalemate. Once the record was opened, luck also followed. One minute later, Suen Kam Shun dribbled into the area, and the Portuguese defender, in desperation, pulled him down, resulting in a penalty. Koo Sheung Yeung executed it and scored successfully (2-0). Shortly after, Cheung Wah launched another attack from the periphery, forcing a corner kick. Suen Kam Shun took the kick, which landed right in front of the goal. Collins jumped to catch it but missed, and Ka, Hui, and Tai rushed in, with Yau Leung tapping it in. The first half ended with a score of 3-0.</p>
<p>Second Half: The second half began, and Tung Wah's attack became more intense. They missed two good opportunities. Five minutes into the half, Ka Yau Leung pointed with his whip, and Tai Lun King headed the ball in, opening the record again. Not long after, Ka had another excellent opportunity, sprinting to the baseline and hooking the ball in, but unfortunately, there was no one to receive it, and Collins caught it, which was a great pity. After several rounds, Tung Wah's army directly approached the enemy's territory again. Hui and Tai broke through the crowd and drove straight in. At the penalty line, Tai Lun King rushed out and shot, hitting the target with precision. After this, the Portuguese attack became strong again, with Rocha and Lopes shooting twice, both of which were extremely dangerous. On Tung Wah's side, Suen Kam Shun hit the post and the ball bounced out, Tai Lun King's fierce shot was forced into a corner kick, and Ka Yau Leung was also trapped by the Portuguese defenders. Good opportunities were missed again and again. Both sides attacked and defended, holding each other for about twenty minutes. In front of the Portuguese goal, it became Tung Wah's artillery position, with concentrated firepower and accurate range. Collins managed to catch them one by one, saving them from danger. After a short pause, Tung Wah's penalty area also became chaotic, but they did not fall. Time flew by quickly, with only one minute left before the end of the match. Suen Kam Shun, who had been feeling frustrated for a long time, got a ball, rushed out alone, and shot from twenty yards, flying straight into the net. Collins was caught off guard and helpless. Before the center line kick, the whistle had already sounded for a long time. Tung Wah won 6-0 against Portugal.</p>

<h3>French Commercial Hard Court Tennis: Lee and Shen Advance to the Third Week; Zhou Champion Unfortunate to be Defeated by Collaco; Afternoon Stopped Due to Rain, No Games Today</h3>
<p>The French Commercial Association's hard court tennis tournament was held for the second day yesterday. Men's, women's, and mixed doubles matches began successively. Twenty matches were originally scheduled, and the competition began in the morning. Although there was light rain in the early morning, the matches continued despite the rain. In the afternoon, the venue was saturated with water and extremely slippery, so it was temporarily stopped. Those who completed the schedule included four groups of the second week of the men's singles. Lee Kwok Fan and Shen Mei Zhen both won. However, Zhou Champion was unfortunately defeated by Collaco. Now, among the two major branches of the men's singles, only Ma On Quan can compete with Collaco on Collaco's side. The rest will be unable to withstand Collaco's attacks, so Collaco's entry into the finals week is extremely stable. On the other hand, there are many competitors. Among the Chinese players, there are Lee Pei Zu, Lee Kwok Fan, Shen Mei Zhen, and Suen Ki Fong. Among the Westerners, Sciuira is the only brave general. Predicting the situation on this side, the two Lees will meet in the quarter-finals, and the victory or defeat of this internal conflict will greatly affect everyone's future. However, it is also expected that Sciuira will be eliminated by the two Lees in the quarter-finals. Yesterday, Zhou Champion's loss to Collaco by two sets of 6-3 was most unfortunate. Lee Kwok Fan's victory over Ran Slim Ge was incredibly crisp. Shen Mei Zhen's victory over Mastra was full of surprises and tension, which also shows Shen's recent progress in tennis skills. As for the matches that were stopped yesterday, the date of resumption will be decided by the association committee on Wednesday. The schedule for next week will also be arranged at that time. There are no matches from tomorrow onwards and will resume on the 7th (Saturday). The results of each match yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Singles: Lee Kwok Fan defeated Ran Slim Ge 6-2, 6-3; Shen Mei Zhen defeated Mastra 5-7, 6-1, 6-4; Collaco defeated Zhou Champion 6-3, 6-3; Canafanlo defeated Turner 6-4, 6-2.</p>
<p>Men's Doubles: Pantuloff Indic Bull defeated Taxipi Cer 6-2, 6-3; Messi Maso Law defeated Cenascher Favre 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>Women's Singles: Mrs. Klein Nov defeated Mrs. Gilol 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>Women's Doubles: Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Malay defeated Mrs. Kate and Miss Andre (late forfeit).</p>

<p>Yesterday's competition has entered the final stage. The outcome will be determined this time. Among them, the most exciting was the match between Jin De B and Kai Wen B at the Strive level. Both sides were extremely strong, and their attacks and defenses reached a high level. Unfortunately, two or three strong players from Kai Wen were unable to attend the match due to circumstances and were replaced by substitutes, which caused them to be trapped by Jin De and defeated 4-0. However, Kai Wen's defender Wang Guoquan was extremely brave, supporting the critical situation and blocking many dangerous balls. Otherwise, Kai Wen's loss would not have been limited to this number. Here are the teams that have won the championship as a result of yesterday's matches:</p>

Yesterday afternoon, in the final between Yongliang and Ant, Ant had six players on the field, and they were defeated by Yongliang. Several spectators close to the Ant side did not understand the situation and blamed the referee, even shouting to beat him, which was enough to damage the team's reputation.</p>
<p>The association's matches on the afternoon of the 7th of this month will be held ten minutes earlier.</p>

<h3>British Style Small Ball to be Demonstration Game: Now Being Compiled</h3>
<p>In order to promote small ball sports, the Chinese National Small Ball Association, which is actively preparing for its establishment, will launch a league using British-style small balls.

It is learned that the association, in view of the necessity of publicity and demonstration, has hired experts to compile a special book based on the British-style small ball regulations.

Players who are injured and leave the field can be replaced by substitutes, but only two are allowed. (3) Court layout: The court is a rectangular plane, suitable for grass or hard ground. The maximum dimensions are 100 yards long, the goalposts are 6 to 7 yards wide, the height is 7 feet, and the width of the crossbar and two posts shall not exceed 5 inches. (4) Ball and shoes: The ball is round (about half the size of a small football), with a rubber bladder placed in a yellow leather shell, filled with air to make it expand. The weight of a light ball is at least 6 ounces, and the weight of a heavy ball is at most 8 ounces. The circumference of the ball is 20 to 22 inches. The shoes are required to be cloth shoes or rubber shoes. Players wearing football shoes are not allowed to participate. (5) Game time: "Adult Group" is 70 minutes, "Youth Group" is 60 minutes, and "Children Group" is 50 minutes, with a 10-minute break in the middle.

<h3>Statistics of School-Age Children in Chahar Province: Totaling 142,820, with 66,697 Enrolled</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Quick Dispatch: Chahar Province has a narrow area, with only sixteen counties and three administrative bureaus in the entire province. Since last year when bandit troops invaded northern Chahar, six counties including Zhangbei and Dolun, and the three administrative bureaus of Shangyi, Huade, and Chongli, have formed a special region. They have not yet returned to normal, coupled with the barren land and poor people, and insufficient financial resources, resulting in the lack of significant results in administrative areas such as construction and education. Regarding education, although the Chahar provincial authorities are in this situation, they are still proceeding step by step according to the established plan, especially actively promoting compulsory education, sparing no effort. As for the province's school-age children, as well as those who have enrolled and those who have not, there are currently no detailed statistics because the 25th year of the Republic has not yet begun. The report from the 24th year of the Republic recently submitted by the Education Department is considered accurate. According to the survey of children in the province in the 23rd year of the Republic, there were 47,966 school-age children in the nine counties and bureaus of northern Chahar, with 8,726 enrolled and 39,240 not enrolled.

<h3>Wusong Merchant Marine College Commemorates the 7th Anniversary of its Revival</h3>
<p>The Wusong Merchant Marine College, directly under the Ministry of Communications, was founded in the late Qing Dynasty. It was suspended for a period of time and revived in the 18th year of the Republic, and it has been seven years since then. Graduates from previous years have all been assigned to senior crew positions and have been praised by the maritime industry. The current principal, Mr. Liu Yonggao, is a famous naval veteran. Since taking office, he has been following the instructions of Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications and has been working hard to reorganize the school affairs. More than 30 graduates from the navigation and machinery departments this year were introduced by Principal Liu to various maritime administrative agencies and shipping companies after graduating this summer, and they have all been employed. It can also be seen that the school's cultivation of maritime talents has been highly trusted by various sectors of maritime administration and shipping. The anniversary of the school's revival was celebrated on the same day. Because it was a time of national crisis, no extravagant activities were held. At 10:00 am, Principal Liu led all staff and students to hold a memorial ceremony in the auditorium. Director Wu of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, representing the Ministry of Communications, attended the school. After the ceremony was held as scheduled, Principal Liu reported on the school's founding and revival. Then, Director Wu spoke on behalf of the Ministry of Communications, detailing the relationship between the school and maritime rights and shipping, and encouraging students to study hard. The Ministry has great hopes for them. Subsequently, guests including President Weng of Tongji University and Mr. Tao Yishan, representative of the Shanghai Military Training Association, gave speeches one after another, with many enlightening words. In the afternoon, sports meetings were held in the rain. The various programs were also quite special and wonderful. The meeting ended in the fading twilight.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Shanghai YWCA (Manuscript from the YWCA)</h3>
<p>People's Education</p>
<p>Eliminating one illiterate is increasing the strength of national self-renewal by one point, and it is also strengthening the blow against the enemy's aggression. Ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai! Do you like to increase the strength of national self-renewal? Are you also willing to strengthen the blow against the enemy's aggression? As long as you save a few 2.65 yuan in legal tender in a year according to your strength, you can eliminate one - two - three - hundreds of illiterates. Why? According to the experience of our Shanghai YWCA in establishing women's people's schools over the years (since 1923, we have opened dozens of civil education classes in various districts of Shanghai), as long as there is a classroom (at least one, preferably two or three), and one or two enthusiastic teachers with national ideas, and prepare some funds each semester (100 yuan or several hundred yuan), you can enroll dozens or hundreds of illiterate women students, open classes to teach them (it was very difficult to enroll students before, but after having results, we only dislike the small rooms and too many people, and now it is becoming more and more crowded). After four or five months or a year of serious teaching and training (only two hours of classes per day), students will be able to write, calculate, read simple newspapers, make simple speeches, practice clean hygiene, and also change their old-fashioned ideas, knowing that women are also people - important people, knowing their own family environment, social conditions, national status, foreign enemy aggression, and also changing their lives, knowing the importance of group life, the relationship of mutual assistance and mutual force, and all the common sense that a person should have, it can be said that everything is there. According to our statistics, the cost of cultivating such a very simple and very ordinary citizen is at most 2.65 yuan in legal tender. Compared with the schooling fees of aristocratic education, young masters and young ladies, at least several hundred yuan or nearly a thousand yuan per semester, there is a real difference between heaven and earth. Isn't this a very easy thing to do? It is a pity that too few people pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai, please rise up and jointly undertake the basic work of saving the country. We hope that the illiterates in Shanghai will be enlightened by your grace and walk into the path of light. Your merits are truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>Our women's people's school this semester has four districts, divided into morning and evening classes. There are 444 students in the spring and 788 students in the autumn, totaling 1,232 people. Our strength is only these. Please help us!</p>
<p>Adult Education</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Live and learn," and "While there is still breath, there is no room for relaxation." This is to instruct people that the world's knowledge is infinite, and do not be ashamed to stop learning because you are an adult. Therefore, the adult education department of the Shanghai YWCA specializes in implementing various educational undertakings for adult members and adult non-members, so that older women can still keep up with the trend and have the opportunity to contact society, so as to avoid the danger of natural elimination, and with the unity of this organization, they can develop their talents and implement their long-cherished aspirations to love the country. The general outline of adult education is briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) Remedial Classes: We know that adult women must have family responsibilities, or other reasons, and cannot be outside all day for classes, so we specially open various remedial classes, such as Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Chinese and foreign cooking, handicraft, sewing, first aid, nanny class, typing and shorthand, piano, violin, social dance, tap dance, etc. Each subject is one hour a day, or two or three hours a week, so that they will not neglect family affairs because of learning, and will not forget their studies because of family affairs, and the opportunity to study can increase new knowledge, meet new friends, to get rid of the monotony of life, and the pain of boredom.</p>
<p>(2) Gymnasium: Women in Shanghai, where land is at a premium, rarely have fitness exercises other than laboring in household affairs and working in public affairs. In view of the importance of women's sports, the Association has specially opened a large gymnasium behind the Association on Jing'an Temple Road, which is divided into tennis, volleyball, basketball, etc., and also has swimming (borrowing the swimming pool of the Navy Youth Association) as a place for women from all walks of life to exercise their bodies in their spare time and after household affairs.</p>
<p>(3) Research Discussion and Lecture Meeting: Organize groups to study current affairs, discuss family affairs, lecture on international trends, religious truths, and other important groups, as the basis for improving and assisting the family, society, and country.</p>
<p>(4) Visits, Travel, and Social Music Concerts: We want to develop their interest in outdoor life, cultivate their proper entertainment habits, point out the way to common sense, and connect their mutual assistance and unity, so there are visits to famous factories, travel to scenic spots, and the initiation of social music concerts.</p>

<p>Now, Zhejiang Local Bank and Jiangxi Yumin Bank have first drafted a contract for mutual remittance and exchange of auxiliary currency notes between the two provinces. After the banks of the two provinces submit it to the business meeting of the head office for approval, they will sign it and implement it on New Year's Day.

<h3>Local Association Cables to Request Relaxation of Rice and Grain Ban in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association believes that the express ban on the export of rice and grain from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has greatly affected the social economy. On October 31, it telegraphed the chairmen of the two provinces, requesting the ban to be relaxed. The text reads: "To Chairman Chen and Chairman Huang of the Provincial Government of Zhenjiang and Hangzhou, this year, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have all celebrated a bumper harvest, and transportation is convenient, which can promote the circulation of rice and grain and enrich rural finance. Now, it is heard that the provincial government is carefully accumulating grain and expressly prohibits it from being exported from the province, which may lead to overproduction and a sharp drop in rice prices. Areas that need rice may worry about not being able to supply it. Shanghai needs rice and grain from other provinces. Hearing this ban, merchants have become panicked. It is believed that exports to foreign countries must be prohibited, but domestic circulation should still be allowed. The members of our association all have this idea. Therefore, we specifically telegraphed to request you to consider the relationship between farmers and merchants and the social economy, and withdraw the express ban on the export of rice and grain from the province. On the other hand, strictly prohibit exports to foreign countries. Respectfully await your decision and reply." Shanghai Local Association, Du Yong, Qian Yongming, Wang Xiaolai, et al.</p>

<h3>Gu Xin-yi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing; the Rice Seizure in Zhejiang Province Has Been Ordered Stopped by the Executive Yuan; the Ministry of Industries Expressed Acceptance of Shanghai Merchants' Requests</h3>
<p>Gu Xin-yi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain Merchants' Association, regarding the matter of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments prohibiting rice exports from their provinces, went to Nanjing on the 30th, along with a petition from the association, to request that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industries order the Jiangsu and Zhejiang authorities to rescind the ban. Mr. Gu having completed his business in Nanjing, left the city yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. A reporter from the Central News Agency paid him a special visit to inquire about the situation regarding his petition to the Yuan and Ministry in Nanjing. According to Mr. Gu, in addition to representing the grain industry in participating in the airplane donation ceremony, he also petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industries regarding the Jiangsu and Zhejiang authorities' prohibition of rice exports. He arrived in Nanjing the day before yesterday (the 31st), and after participating in the airplane donation ceremony, first went to the Executive Yuan to petition. Secretary-General Weng Wenhao received him, and in addition to personally presenting the association's petition, he also described the situation of the people's food supply in Shanghai, and how the prohibition of rice exports by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang authorities would likely cause panic in Shanghai's food supply. The Secretary-General agreed that prohibiting rice exports was indeed contrary to the central government's original intention of relieving rural areas and regulating food supplies. However, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang authorities had not yet reported the matter of prohibiting rice exports to Nanjing, but since the association had submitted a report stating that rice seizures had occurred in Zhejiang, the Executive Yuan would first issue an order to stop them. As for the association's proposed method of exporting rice, there were still some inappropriate aspects, and a central government review should be conducted before any regulations were made. He then went to the Ministry of Industries, where Director Xu Tinghu of the Agricultural Affairs Department and Director Zhang Yi'ou of the Commercial Affairs Department received him and expressed acceptance of the requests of the Shanghai merchants. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance happened to be convening a meeting of relevant ministries and commissions at 3 p.m. that afternoon to discuss the unified control of food, so the two directors took the petition of the Shanghai merchants to the meeting for reference. It is understood that the result of the discussion was that everyone agreed that prohibiting exports was inappropriate, but that in the future there should be accurate statistics on transportation and sales, so that the unified control of food could be gradually implemented in the future. As for the detailed measures, they still needed to be carefully planned.</p>

<h3>All Catholic Churches in the City Prayed for Premier Chiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>For Premier Chiang's 50th birthday celebration, the Catholic Church, in addition to Archbishop Cai representing all Catholics sending a telegram of congratulations and promoting the donation of ambulances, Bishop Haou of Shanghai notified all priests and Catholics under his jurisdiction a decade ago to offer public prayers for China and its leader on the Sunday before and after Chiang's birthday. Subsequently, because last Sunday coincided with the national funeral period for the late Chairman Hu, and the whole country was in mourning, it was not appropriate to hold extravagant celebrations, so everything was uniformly changed to November 1st for a fervent celebration. Yesterday morning, more than 20 Catholic churches in the city rang their bells loudly and in unison, as if it were a great holiday. Although it was raining, Catholics flocked to the nearest Catholic churches to participate in the Mass and prayers with great enthusiasm. The churches were decorated with red velvet banners, fresh flowers, and candles, and the displays were extremely luxurious. From 5 a.m. to noon, priests took turns holding Mass, preaching the principles of loving and saving the country and supporting the government, and encouraging believers to pray for the country's difficulties and the leader, asking God to bless Premier Chiang with health, longevity, and peace, and to grant China national prosperity, peace, and abundant harvests. The Catholic churches in Xinbeimen, Rue Lupan, Xujiahui, Dongjiadu, and Nanxun Road all had musical performances, and the streets were crowded with people and carriages, making for a grand scene.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Suburban Rural Improvement Area, in order to review the past and encourage the future, specially convened an achievement exhibition yesterday (the 1st) at 9 a.m. at Zhaojiatang, north of Zhuanqiao on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, braving the rain, and held a grand ceremony, with an unprecedented grand occasion. The following is a compilation of the various situations:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Starting at 1:30 p.m., the opening meeting was held in the plaza. Zhang Fengshan was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the rituals, Chairman Zhang first gave a report, saying in brief, "Respected officials, respected guests, respected comrades, today the Shanghai Suburban Rural Improvement Area is holding a village activity, and especially the national defense exhibition is even more meaningful. I am very honored and very grateful that you have taken the time to participate in the rain. China is a country based on agriculture. Of course, everything in the countryside has a major relationship with the country. Just think, China's land is so large, why is it not enough? And why are the people so weak? If we want to make the country productive and revitalized, we must first implement the Baojia system. But it needs the promotion of education. The Shanghai Suburban Rural Improvement Area is to ensure that every adult, child, and woman has the right to receive compulsory education. Although there have been no achievements in the two years since this area was implemented, the reduction of illiteracy is still fulfilling our responsibility. We hope that the officials and guests who are present will provide practical guidance to jointly promote the construction of a new countryside."</p>
<p>General Secretary's Report</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, General Secretary Yao Huiquan reported on the work of the area in the past year, saying in brief that the Zhaojiatang Office was established in July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and the Jinjiatang, Zhangjiatang, and Maojiawan offices and the Wangjiaqiao and Nijiaqiao seven branches were established in July of the 24th year. The business area of this area is between the second and third districts of Shanghai County, covering approximately 50 square li. According to the latest statistics, there are a total of 1,047 households and 4,481 people in the entire area, accounting for 3.6% of the total population of the county. The experimental period is temporarily set for three years, and it has been two years since its establishment. In these short two years, we have devoted ourselves to the four issues of "economy," "education," "autonomy," and "hygiene" as the central goals of improving the countryside. Then, the inspectors Jiang Wenyu and Wang Gongyu led more than 50 people from the seventh Bao of Zhong'an Township, the sixth Bao of Beiqiao Town, and the third Bao of Jingtu Township in a review. Finally, there was a rescue performance, the Hongying Elementary School student association sang a march, and Wang Gongyu, the administrative commissioner of the third district, and others gave speeches. The meeting ended happily at about 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Only About 40 Silk Factories in Shanghai are Operating; Due to a Shortage of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Due to a shortage of raw materials, various silk factories in Shanghai have successively suspended operations.

In total, only about 40 factories are operating. All the remaining cocoons can only last until the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Scarce Wheat Sources; Flour Mills Lack Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that flour mills in Shanghai have recently experienced a scarcity of wheat sources, resulting in a significant shortage of raw materials. They want to purchase foreign wheat, but the prices are too high, so they have no choice but to reduce production. However, demand from various regions is very strong, causing market prices to rise daily. The reporter has investigated and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Sources</p>
<p>The raw materials for flour mills in Shanghai, in addition to foreign wheat, mostly depend on wheat produced in Gaoyou, Taizhou, and Yancheng counties in northern Jiangsu. The annual amount transported to Shanghai is estimated at about 1.7 to 1.8 million bags. This year, the amount transported to Shanghai has reached only 50% to 60% of that amount. Recently, the sales of flour to Guangdong, Tianjin, and Southeast Asia have been brisk, and demand is very strong, resulting in the wheat arriving in Shanghai being insufficient for the consumption of various mills. Moreover, the wheat stored in various places in northern Jiangsu is affected by shallow water, difficult transportation, and the fact that farmers must wait for good prices, so the sources have suddenly become scarce, with only 70,000 to 80,000 bags arriving daily.</p>
<p>Factories Reduce Production</p>
<p>Various flour mills, due to the limited wheat sources and the significant shortage of raw materials, and the fact that various grain firms also have no inventory to hoard, making sourcing very difficult, although flour sales are brisk and market prices are high, they are ultimately unable to produce at full capacity to meet the market due to the scarcity of raw materials, so they have no choice but to reluctantly reduce production. Factories such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Yuxing are all in a state of reduced production or intermittent operation.</p>
<p>Did Not Purchase Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Each year, the raw materials needed by various flour mills, in addition to domestic wheat, include foreign wheat, which accounts for 40% to 50%. According to sources in the grain industry, this year, due to the poor harvests of American wheat, the quoted prices are very high. Although there are rumors that Australian wheat may be exported, there is no definite news yet. Therefore, various flour mills have not yet placed orders with foreign merchants because the selling price of foreign wheat is too different from that of domestic wheat, making it too uneconomical.</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts Log</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, left Beijing by express train yesterday afternoon. The military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, Kita; the naval attaché, Sato; and the information director, Hirataka Kumagawa, and three others, traveled to Beijing by overnight express train yesterday.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Ship Radio Stations Officially Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Regulations on Ship Radio Stations have been formulated and officially promulgated. It is understood that these regulations have been officially implemented starting yesterday and have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance.</p>
<h3>Moore Memorial Church Unemployment Relief Group</h3>
<p>The Moore Memorial Church on Sima Road is sparing no effort in providing relief to unemployed people. Previously, the original "Disciple Unemployment Relief Group" was disorganized, so it was reorganized into the "Moore Memorial Church Unemployment Relief Group." There are currently more than a dozen members, not limited to Christians. The pastor of the church, the American missionary Anderson, serves concurrently as the group leader, and the pastor Fang Chunhao serves concurrently as the secretary. They are given appropriate training every day. The income from the members' shoe-shining work is deposited in the group, and three jiao is issued daily for living expenses. At the end of the month, the surplus is settled and distributed to the members separately, and the amount received is quite substantial. Therefore, the members have recently been working even harder.</p>

<h3>Bank of China and Bank of Communications Prepare to Handle National Rice Transportation and Discounting; Detailed Measures Have Been Drafted by the Two Banks; Negotiations Will Be Held Within Days, Starting with Hunan Rice</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, in order to assist the government in regulating the people's food supply, have jointly established a consortium with the Bank of Shanghai, Continental Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Salt Industry Bank, National Products Bank, Guohua Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to handle national rice transportation and discounting loans. After a consultation, it was decided to underwrite the three major principles of discounting. The total loan amount is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. In order to save expenses, it is not intended to establish a formal banking syndicate, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are publicly elected as representatives to be responsible for handling the matter. All detailed measures have been drafted by the two banks, and after a second consultation, they will be implemented. It is understood that the loan measures have long been drafted. However, Director Yang of the Second Division of the Bank of China, who is in charge of the matter, returned to his hometown for personal reasons, so a second meeting could not be convened. Mr. Yang has now returned to Shanghai, and it is planned to invite the participating banks to a meeting within days to make a decision. It is heard that the loan procedures are quite simple. All domestic rice and grain that has been inspected and approved by the Ministry of Industry, and rice merchants who have a good reputation, can apply to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications' branches in various places. If, after review, the regulations are met, the applicant will submit the bill of lading, insurance policy, invoice, etc., and the syndicate will first provide 80% of the discounting price. After the rice is transported to the destination, the purchaser will repay the loan. The syndicate will only collect 7% interest as a commission. However, it has been decided that the first step will be to handle the discounting of Hunan rice transported to Guangdong, and then gradually expand it in the future.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Insurance Companies to Fairly Assess and Compensate</h3>
<p>Bao Feng Ginseng Shop, a member of the Shanghai Marine Products &amp; Edible Bird's Nest Guild, suffered a significant loss in June of this year when the Yong Yu Tai Ginseng Shop next door was careless and caught fire. Although Bao Feng Ginseng Shop was not affected by the fire itself, water was poured into and accumulated in its storage rooms during the firefighting. The insurance company did not assess and compensate for the loss, so the guild sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the insurance companies. The text of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter to Gong Yu &amp; Sun Insurance Company, etc., is as follows:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs,</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Marine Products &amp; Edible Bird's Nest Guild's letter of the 28th of this month, its member Bao Feng Ginseng Shop stated in its letter that at 6:10 p.m. on June 7th of this year, the Yong Yu Tai Ginseng Shop next door was careless and caught fire. Thanks to the fire department's quick rescue, the fire did not spread. Bao Feng Ginseng Shop's fire insurance of 200,000 yuan, was not enough to cover the water damage to its goods, which was valued at more than 20,000 yuan. The San Yi Public Notary Office sent personnel to investigate, but its assessment seemed to show favoritism, arguing that there was less water accumulation on the third floor and more on the second floor. The fire department's priority was to suppress the fire, so the water pressure focused on one side. Bao Feng Ginseng Shop's roof is a concrete platform, with a gas shed next to it. Due to this sudden attack, the water entered from the gas shed and leaked along the west side of the gas shed. The wooden floors of the three floors below were not heavily damaged, because the damage came from water seeping down. The two cement rooms on the second floor accumulated about two or three inches of water, because one side of the gas cylinder in that layer was not separated by wooden boards, and only had wooden fences for cover, making it very easy for water to enter Bao Feng Ginseng Shop's storage room, which was located there. As for the lower room, there were also three or four inches of water accumulation, which came from the gas cylinder. The power of the water that poured in can be imagined. So far, several months have passed without a resolution. It is unclear what facts the San Yi Public Notary Office based its opinion on, and the office stubbornly insisted on its bias. Bao Feng Ginseng Shop provided documents and evidence to the best of its ability, but the office arbitrarily refused to acknowledge the proper reasons why the insurance company was not compensating for the losses, causing great loss to the business. This is not only contrary to legal principles, but also contrary to human sentiment. Bao Feng Ginseng Shop took out fire insurance policies with six companies - Kung Yih, Sun, North Manchu, Anglo-American, Paoting, Hope-Lai, and Peir - based on their reputation for creditworthiness, but when the unfortunate incident occurred, each of these insurance companies refused to fulfill its obligation to compensate for the loss based on a biased opinion. They do not care about the affected business owner, and they undermine the credibility of the insurance business. In addition to the damage Bao Feng Ginseng Shop suffered being witnessed by countless people at the time, several businesses, such as Tong Yu, Zhen Yuan, and Bao Da, were willing to testify to the facts of the incident out of a sense of injustice. These letters of testimony, which had already been submitted to San Yi Public Notary Office to forward to the insurance companies, clearly show the truth. Bao Feng Ginseng Shop, whose capital and reputation are at stake, should report the facts and request your inspection and proper referral to the Chamber of Commerce for negotiation in order to maintain its losses. After investigation, it was found that the member has been operating on Lizhi Xianhua Street for more than ten years, with a good reputation. After further investigation of the true situation at the time, it was confirmed that it suffered a large loss. The insurance companies should be liable for compensating the insured amount without any doubt. As for the San Wan Public Notary Office, which said that there was less water on the third floor and more water on the second floor, it disregarded the facts and adhered to its own bias, which was inappropriate. One must know that at that time, the fire was raging, and firefighters had to use water pressure to aim upwards from below, which is an inevitable principle. Moreover, the nature of water is to flow downwards. How could it not seek the lowest point and flow downwards? This is enough to show that the notary office adhered to its own view and did not care about the pain of the victim. If this case is resolved without any reason, the credibility of foreign insurance businesses will suffer a great blow. Therefore, we have sent this letter based on the foregoing, requesting your examination and immediate notification to the Shanghai Foreign Merchants Insurance Association, and sending separate letters to Gong Yu, Sun, North Manchu, Anglo-American, Paoting, Hope-Lai, and Peir insurance companies, requesting them to compensate immediately in order to maintain their credibility. We also request that you send another letter to San Yi Public Notary Office, requesting it to adhere to the facts, recognize its notary position, and speak fairly.</p>
<p>Based on this, after checking the situation, it was found that Bao Feng Ginseng Shop was implicated by the negligence of its neighbor and suffered losses when the fire department's water poured down on the storage room on the second floor, which is an undeniable fact. Fair assessment and compensation should be provided. Accordingly, this letter is sent based on the situation, hoping that your company will investigate and immediately provide an assessment and compensation in order to maintain its credibility. We are deeply grateful. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby send this to Gong Yu, Sun, Paoting, North American, Hope-Lai, Anglo-American, Peir Insurance Company, and San Yi Public Notary Office.</p>

<h3>City Federation Appeals to the Public Works Department on Behalf of Distressed Shantytown Residents; Requests Permission for Rebuilding Pending Construction of Public Housing to Uphold Humanitarian Principles</h3>
<p>The shantytown residents in the Linqing Road area of Shanghai's Pudong district suffered a devastating fire a few days ago. The number of victims reached over four hundred, leaving them homeless and in a dire situation. They have been appealing to all parties for days, requesting permission to rebuild their shelters for accommodation. The First Special District Citizen's Federation yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department stating that it had recently received a joint report from Wang Naide and others, representatives of the shantytown residents who lost their homes on Linqing Road, Pudong District. The report stated that the most painful experience for humans is to be without food, clothing, and shelter. Now, being able to temporarily erect a thatched hut to provide minimal protection from the elements is already a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune. However, good fortune never comes in pairs, and bad luck always comes in droves. At 3:30 PM on October 25th, the thatched shacks in which we resided were struck by the disaster of fire and completely destroyed. Initially, it was just a small spark, and if the fire trucks had been allowed to extinguish it, there would have been no risk of it spreading. However, the Western constables of the police station prevented the extinguishing of the fire, causing the wind to fan the flames, which quickly spread throughout the area. All forty-eight households in the district were completely burned down, and the number of victims reached over four hundred and thirty. People of all ages cried out in despair. Fortunately, the Chinese Life Saving Society provided assistance to each household, which was enough to relieve their hunger. However, after this disaster, what could be done to recover? Not only did they have no home to return to, but they also lacked the means to cook. Now, they were all sleeping amidst the ashes and were being harassed by detectives, making the oppression of the disaster unbearable. Therefore, they specifically requested the Public Works Department to speak out for them, negotiate with the Public Works Department to punish the Western constables who prevented the extinguishing of the fire, and allow them to rebuild their shelters so that the victims would not be forced to roam the streets and disrupt public order. Humans have compassion, and there is a virtue of cherishing life. They humbly requested approval, etc. The report was submitted to the Federation. The Federation previously suggested to the Public Works Department to construct public housing in stages to accommodate the shantytown residents and gradually phase out shantytowns. Before this policy is implemented, the Public Works Department should grant permission for the burned shantytown residents to rebuild their shelters to uphold humanitarian principles and avoid triggering incidents. This is our sincere hope.</p>

<h3>Various Industries Have Been Raising Prices</h3>
<p>Since the sharp increase in the price of cotton yarn, the prices of raw materials such as cotton and yarn have been increasing one after another. Starting yesterday, November 1st, the line blanket industry, tape industry, and electrical appliance industry also implemented price increases. The notices issued by these industries regarding price increases are excerpted below: (1) Shanghai Line Blanket Industry's Notice of Price Increase: The prices of line blankets produced by our industry have been soaring recently, and the prices of all affiliated supplies have also been increasing. The current selling price is far from covering the cost. Therefore, we have gathered the industry to discuss and decided to appropriately increase the selling price starting from November 1st of this year in order to maintain our capital. For those with the original price of 27 yuan or less, add 2 yuan per dozen, and for those above that, add 3 yuan. The discount is uniformly 20%. This is hereby announced. We hope all businesses will understand. (2) Jingda, Deyi, Zhengda, Zhengxing, Yaohua, Zhenfeng, Wang Yongchang, and other seven flashlight factories also increased the price by 2 jiao per dozen starting yesterday (the 1st) in order to maintain costs, and jointly notified customers to understand. (3) The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Factory Industry Association had already increased the price by 1 jiao per yard due to the soaring price of raw materials, but the capital was still difficult to maintain. It has now been discussed again, and another 1 jiao has been added to each yard. Other factories such as the Hongfa Woolen Fabric Spinning Factory also increased the price again yesterday, adding 1 jiao per yard. In addition, machine-made briquette and sauce factories have also been raising prices to maintain their capital.</p>

<h3>Li Sihao Visited Kong to Inquire About the Date and Will Visit Xu Kan, Zou Lin, Chen Xing, etc.; Denies the Resurrection of the China Remittance and Banking Corporation</h3>
<p>Li Sihao, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Economic Committee, returned to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 31st. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week and will take a China National Aviation Corporation plane back to Beiping via Nanjing without stopping. Li's family will take a train north. Li visited Sato, the naval attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, at Diswei Road at 3 PM on the 31st for about an hour and a half. Then, he went to Wuding Road to visit Kita, the army attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, and did not leave until about 6 PM. Li's visit to the Japanese naval attaché this time was not only a matter of courtesy, but also to exchange views. While in Shanghai, Li visited Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, for instructions. However, Kong was ill and did not see guests. Therefore, Li sent a letter to Kong's son on the 31st, asking him to arrange an appointment. Li also planned to visit Xu Kan, Zou Lin, and Chen Xing, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, today to exchange views. According to Li, the general situation in North China is good. The rumor that he came to Shanghai to proceed with the resumption of the China Remittance and Banking Corporation is a misunderstanding. The China Remittance and Banking Corporation has no intention of resuming operations at present. Even if it does resume operations in the future, the negotiation location will be in Tianjin and Tokyo. The China Remittance and Banking Corporation currently has an office in Tianjin, which is headed by Director Harada. The Japanese shareholders of the bank are the Bank of Chosen, the Bank of Taiwan, and the Industrial Bank of Japan.</p>

<h3>Gu Ge Shang Killed Someone; The Deceased's Wife Sought Justice for Her Husband; The Case of Tao A'er's Murder</h3>
<p>Tao A'er (30 years old) from Suzhou, who lived at No. 38 Beihai Road, British Concession, had worshiped Gu the Monk (also known as Da Heshang) from Zhoupu as his elder. On the 19th of this month, there was a festival in Tanzhi Bridge Town, Nanhui County. Tao and his friend Gu Peifeng went to a gambling stall in the Lu Alian and Fan Awu teahouse in the town.

The other disciples of Gu also started beating him and then dispersed. Because Gu and Tao had a deep grudge, Tao said to Gu, "There is no point in staying here. We will charter a boat back to Shanghai tomorrow." When the steamer arrived, they boarded the ship immediately. Unexpectedly, Gu Da Heshang led more than ten disciples to force Tao and Gu ashore. They then went to the Lu teahouse. Gu shouted loudly, "If anyone is unwilling, they can come to Shen Village to talk." Gu saw that the situation was not good, so he knelt down and begged. Later, he and Gu went together. Tao walked in front. Unexpectedly, when they reached Chuanjiazhai, Tao A'er was suddenly shot in the back. He was hit and immediately fell to the ground, dying.

<h3>Various Sectors Participate Independently; Paris Exposition to be Held Next July: Modern Arts and Technology</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Chinese government has not yet expressed its intention to participate in the International Exposition of Modern Arts and Technology to be held in Paris next July. Chinese and French individuals greatly hope that China will exhibit. Various sectors of culture and industry also deeply feel the necessity of participation. The Chinese Association for World Cultural Cooperation in the Yamamoto Concession initiated an invitation to leaders from various sectors and held multiple consultations. It was decided to organize the Chinese Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition of Modern Arts and Technology, establishing a preparatory office at 1856 Xiafei Road within the Cultural Association. A delegation was appointed to prepare to go, and all expenses will be raised by the participating parties themselves. It was also decided that prominent figures from various sectors, including Wu Zhihui, Cai Jiemin, Zhang Jingjiang, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Qian Xinzhi, Chu Minyi, Li Shizeng, Liu Jinzhen, Li Runzhang, Chen Mengzhao, Zhao Zhiyou, Zhuang Wenya, and many others, would jointly send letters to various parties, seeking members. As for the delegates of the delegation, it is reported that Chu Minyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Liu Fucheng, Liu Xichang, and Xie Zengfa have been hired to serve, with Chu Minyi as the chief representative. Now, the association's membership solicitation announcement is recorded below. Respected Sir/Madam, it is hereby notified that France intends to hold the International Exposition of Modern Arts and Technology in Paris in July of the 26th year. Previously, the authorities of that country sent a letter to our government, inviting participation. At the same time, the French Association for World Cultural Cooperation also sent a letter to our association, requesting cultural participation in the exhibition. Subsequently, due to various reasons, our government planned not to participate, which was regretted by Chinese and French individuals. However, various sectors in France deeply hope that various sectors in our country will prepare independently in the social sphere to go to the exhibition. Letters and telegrams have been frequent, with earnest words. They have also had sincere consultations with colleagues at home and abroad. We also deeply feel that the communication of Chinese and Western culture and the exchange of ideas and materials depend on the promotion of exhibitions and observations. Therefore, after repeated meetings, it is planned to organize the Chinese Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition of Modern Arts and Technology in the name of social groups, and a delegation will be appointed to prepare to go. However, because this matter is significant and of utmost importance, and all participation expenses must be raised independently, it is urgently necessary to obtain generous assistance from talents at home and abroad to jointly accomplish this endeavor. It has been decided to solicit the following three types of members: (1) Founding members (naturally the chairman of the council's presidium) who pay a membership fee of 100 national currency; (2) Sponsoring members (naturally directors of the council) who pay a membership fee of 150 national currency; (3) Participating members (i.e., ordinary members) who pay a membership fee of 50 national currency. Furthermore, we are sending out letters inviting members to seek the benefit of collective wisdom and to pool membership fees so that small contributions can make a great impact. We have long admired your enthusiasm for public welfare and willingness to assist others. In this grand undertaking to promote national glory, we hope you will be happy to sponsor it. Therefore, we respectfully request you to serve as a member. If we are fortunate enough to receive your approval, it would be a great honor. An application form is attached, and we respectfully request that you sign and send it back. Furthermore, all matters regarding the collection of membership fees have been entrusted to Mr. Li Yunqing of Shanghai Trust Company for handling. Respectfully, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition of Modern Arts and Technology, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yin, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Renjie, She Yong, Lin Kanghou, Li Yuying, Liu Fucheng, Chu Minyi, Qian Xinzhi, Li Shuhua, Zhuang Wenya, Chen Hexian, and others.</p>

<h3>German University Professor Conquers Humanity's Greatest Enemy: Tiny Gonococci Have Spread All Over the World! Their Destructive Power is Immense; Humanity Fears Being Conquered!</h3>
<p>German</p>
<p>University Professor Dr. J. Andernack stated before the European War that gonococci had spread all over the world and that humanity would be conquered by their destructive power. Therefore, he diligently researched drugs to treat gonorrhea. After multiple animal experiments, he invented a membrane-penetrating bactericide called "Mathexin." Its medicinal power can penetrate the urethral mucosa, directly attacking the nest of gonococci, completely eradicating both new and old gonorrhea, and permanently eliminating future troubles.</p>
<p>German</p>
<p>"Mathexin" has been popular worldwide for over ten years. After clinical trials by famous doctors in various countries, it has been proven to be the only effective medicine for gonorrhea. Regardless of new or old gonorrhea, or severe complications of gonorrhea that have not been cured by various treatments, the administration of "German Mathexin" will soon result in recovery. After the disease is cured, microscopic examination of the patient's urine will show that gonococci have disappeared, completely eradicating the root. Repeated tests have been effective. From then on, the evil gonococci have been conquered by Dr. J. Andernack, and human life has been protected by him.</p>
<p>German</p>
<p>"Mathexin" has been selling well in China for a long time and has a great reputation in the medical community. Those with even a little knowledge know that it is the most authoritative medicine for treating gonorrhea. Its membrane-penetrating bactericidal power cannot be compared to any other gonorrhea medicine. Gonorrhea patients can purchase it from pharmacies nearby and take it themselves for a quick cure. The "Special Mathexin" has even stronger penetrating power, and its bactericidal, diuretic, and anti-inflammatory effects are even greater, so sales are even stronger.</p>
<h3>Woman Abuses Her Child; Judge's Reprimand is Effective; Teaching Children Should Emulate "San Niang Teaches Her Son"; Know That When You Hit Your Child, Your Heart Aches</h3>
<p>Zhu Shide from Ningbo used to work as an accountant at the Lide Oil Factory in Zhabei. His family lived at 4423 Roberts Road in Western Shanghai. Zhu's wife, Fang, is 33 years old and has six children. Her third son, Jinli, is now eight years old. After the child was born, Zhu and his wife had a fortune teller calculate his destiny. According to the fortune teller, the child's fate was extremely bad and even unfavorable to his parents. Fang actually believed this nonsense and from then on treated Jinli without any affection. Jinli has been extremely naughty since he was a toddler. Even after severe beatings, he did not repent. A few days ago, he angered his mother again due to a mistake. In addition to being beaten, Fang burned both of his cheeks with cigarette butts. The child fled in pain, wandering around and afraid to go home. He was found by Chinese Constable No. 2582, who questioned him and learned the reason. He was taken to the Putuo Road Police Station, and Detective Yang Chengjie was assigned to send him to the hospital for treatment and arrest Zhu's wife, Fang. The day before yesterday, she was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, filed a lawsuit against her under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. After being questioned by Judge Chuan Lin, she was reprimanded for using excessively cruel methods. He said, "You must have seen the play 'San Niang Teaches Her Son'. As a mother, when teaching your children, you should emulate San Niang in the play. If a child makes a mistake and needs to be beaten, you should only lightly slap the palm of their hand a couple of times. You must know that when you hit your child, your heart aches. Moreover, your child is your own flesh and blood, so you cannot bear to abuse them. Looking at this child, he has a large face and ears, and his appearance is not hateful. If you burn his face and disfigure him, it will inevitably have various effects on his future. Moreover, all capable people are mostly naughty when they are young. As long as parents teach them properly and guide them onto the right path, they will not go astray." The judge's reprimand was both solemn and humorous, and even the ignorant and foolish woman was moved. She lowered her head and admitted her guilt. Judge Chuan then sentenced her to 20 days of detention for abusing her underage biological son, with a two-year suspended sentence. During the probation period, she must bring Jinli to the police station in her jurisdiction every month for inspection so that the police station can protect and supervise the child.</p>
<h3>Rose Garden Clerk Commits Suicide After Theft of Funds: Two Hundred Yuan for Gas Reimbursement Stolen After Pickpocket Slashed His Pocket</h3>
<p>Liu Xinzai from Wuxi, 43 years old, worked as a clerk in the Rose Garden New Village in Caohejing. On the 14th of last month, he went to the West Gate Post Office to remit 10 yuan to his family in his hometown. At that time, he was also carrying 200 national currency for gas reimbursement for the New Village. A pickpocket noticed and managed to slash the pocket where he kept the money, stealing it all and escaping without a trace. By the time Liu discovered it, it was already too late, and he was so frustrated that he suddenly had the idea of ending his life. The next morning around 2 a.m., he went to the Yadong Inn at 15 Lane 6 of Guangdong Road, using the pseudonym Li Lushi, and opened room 81, secretly swallowing sleeping pills to commit suicide. Later, the inn's tea server discovered that he was unconscious and lying on the bed. He reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective He Renrui to investigate. It was indeed found that Liu's inner pocket had been slashed with a knife. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died of exhaustion the day before yesterday. His body was taken to the Féi Lún Road morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, visited the morgue to examine the body. After hearing reports from the detective and the deceased's family about the situation, Tang ruled that the deceased Liu Xinzai, male, had died from poisoning caused by an overdose of sleeping pills. The body was handed over to Liu Jie, the deceased's daughter, to claim and bury.</p>

Furthermore, the owner of our residence, Mr. Pan Ziyi, was neither defrauded nor is he a compradore of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and has absolutely no relationship with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. This letter is to inform you and request that you make a correction to avoid misunderstandings and to ensure verification. Sincerely, the Accountant of the Pan Residence. November 1st.</p>
<h3>Ni Jintang Dies from Circumcision, Xuan Xishou Rashly Performs the Surgery and Kills Him with Anesthesia</h3>
<p>Ni Jintang, a 25-year-old from Shaoxing, was an employee at the Tianhe Dye House at No. 38 North Zhejiang Road. Recently, Ni believed that his foreskin was too long, so he sought advice from his friend Ri Qihong, who worked as a male nurse at the Baolong. Ri then introduced Ni to Xuan Xishou, who had also worked as a nurse at Baolong Hospital and is now an accountant at the Caihua Laundry and Dyeing Shop at No. 533 Baike Road. After Ni explained his intentions, Xuan readily agreed and performed the surgery in the shop at around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, also injecting an analgesic. Unexpectedly, Xuan rashly performed the surgery and used a strong anesthetic. By the time the surgery was completed, it was already 10:00 PM, and Ni Jintang had already died. Xuan Xishou was panicked and immediately called Baolong Hospital, falsely claiming that someone had taken poison and was in critical condition, requesting them to send a car to pick them up quickly. The hospital received the news and, without suspecting anything, immediately went to pick them up. When they attempted to save him, they discovered that the person had already died. However, after carefully examining the deceased's condition, it did not appear to be poisoning. They then examined the body and discovered the cause of death. They immediately reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. They then inquired at the Caihua Laundry and Dyeing Shop and learned the truth. They immediately arrested Tian Qihong and others and will submit them to the court for interrogation this morning. At the same time, they reported to the court, requesting an examination of the body.</p>
<h3>Accountant Li Hongshou's Lecture: Income Tax and Accounting Improvement</h3>
<p>Accountant Li Hongshou of the Lixin Accounting Firm gave a lecture on the implementation of income tax and its relationship to accounting improvement. The following is a record of the lecture:</p>
<p>Today's business operators all know that strategies of competition, monopoly, and mergers and acquisitions can only generate profits temporarily and are not long-term solutions. Therefore, they feel that the only effective long-term solution is to analyze and compare past figures from accounting to serve as a reference for the future. Therefore, accounting has become a business compass. The development of accounting can be divided into three stages. First, to ensure the completeness of bookkeeping records and to save time. Although this goal has been achieved, whether the items on the resulting balance sheet are accurate is still a question. Therefore, the second is to ensure the accuracy of valuation. However, even if the valuation is accurate and the figures on the balance sheet are indeed accurate, they cannot be clearly displayed without comparison and analysis. The state of assets and liabilities and the business situation cannot be known, nor can it be known whether the situation is improving or deteriorating compared to previous years, in order to make improvements. Therefore, the third is the comparison and analysis of the balance sheet. Advanced accounting countries have already done this. As for the history of accounting in our country, it is still in its infancy. For the first step, we have not yet been able to achieve perfection. Although most accounting scholars have vigorously promoted it, compiled series of books, and established schools, its impact is still small. Except for a small number of enterprises that have paid attention to the issue of valuation, most economic enterprises still use the amount of profit as the standard for asset valuation. In our country's industrial and commercial organizations, there is no fixed standard for the valuation of assets. When closing accounts at the end of the year, the asset and liability accounts are first roughly estimated to obtain an approximate amount of profit and loss, which is compared with the required or desired amount of profit and loss, and then the valuation standard is determined. If there is a year with generous profits, the inventory will be undervalued, more depreciation and bad debt reserves will be provided. Conversely, the inventory will be overvalued, less depreciation and bad debt reserves will be provided, or even nothing will be provided, to reduce losses or increase profits. The results of the second step are like this, and the third step can be imagined. Recently, the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, stipulating that the first category is income from profit-making enterprises, and taxes are levied according to the amount of income. If the accounting is not accurate, the amount of income will also be inaccurate. If it is too high, more taxes will be paid, resulting in unexpected losses. If it is too low, less taxes will be paid, creating the suspicion of tax evasion. In the future, business operators will not be able to simply make up enough profit and be done with it. The implementation of this income tax has a tendency to promote accurate accounting, because with accurate accounting, there will be fair taxation. Therefore, I cannot help but celebrate the development of accounting in our country's future, and I especially hope that leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors will consider this early and make improvements in advance to avoid the suspicion of overpaying or evading taxes on the taxes that should be paid. However, each of the above accounting issues has its own valuation method and its own reasons, which are problems that have not been resolved by Chinese and foreign accounting scholars. Moreover, national legislation has the principle of legislation, so there must be detailed regulations in the implementation rules. If it is ambiguous, and merchants choose a method that can pay less tax, what can the government say to question it? In Article 49 of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, only Article 15 stipulates that "When calculating the first category of income, the actual expenses, bad debts, depreciation, inventory consumption, public levies, and public reserve funds stipulated by laws and regulations shall be deducted from the total income, and the remaining balance shall be the net profit, which shall be taxed according to the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations." There are no detailed regulations for the above items. If this is the case, I am afraid that there will be many disputes between business operators and tax collection agencies in the future. I believe that there is a need to amend and supplement the articles. Please state the reasons:</p>
<p>1. Inventory Valuation: There are three methods for inventory valuation: original cost, current market price, and the lower of original cost and current market price. Each of these three methods has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the implementation rules should either specify which method should be adopted, or not specify it, but stipulate that those who used method A last year must still use method A this year and cannot change it. If there is a change, it must be approved in advance. It must also be stipulated that the inventory should have detailed records. If there are no records, an actual inventory must be taken to serve as a basis. When filing the return, the quantity, unit price, amount, valuation standard, and inventory situation of the inventory should also be filled in in detail. Also, the quantity, unit price, and amount of the opening inventory of the current period should be the same as the closing inventory of the previous period. If this is the case, although the valuation for this year is low and less tax can be paid, when it is sold next year and the profit is high, it will still need to be supplemented.</p>
<p>2. Regulations on Depreciation Rate: The depreciation rate of fixed assets depends on the nature of the assets and the length of the usage period. Therefore, there are various depreciation rates, and there are many calculation methods. If there are no regulations, what should be followed? If detailed regulations are made, it would be difficult. If there is a depreciation rate that has been set in the commercial sector, it would be more convenient. The United States has established depreciation rates, which occupy more than 50 pages in the accounting compendium. At a minimum, it should be stipulated that when filing the return, the type, quality, purchase date, original cost, usable period, used period, accumulated depreciation reserves, and depreciation rate for the current period of the asset should be filled in in detail. The depreciation rate for each year should also be the same. If there is a change, it must be approved in advance.</p>
<p>3. Amortization of Bad Debt Reserves: From the perspective of accounting principles, there are various methods for amortizing bad debt reserves. Although it is inconvenient to specify which method should be adopted in the implementation rules of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, it can be stipulated that when filing the return, the sales amount, the balance of accounts receivable, the balance of accounts written off this year, the amount not recovered, and the names and amounts of each difficult-to-recover account should be filled in in detail. It must also be stipulated that the amortization method for each year should be the same. If there is a change, it must be approved in advance.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the division of capital expenditures and revenue expenditures should also be specified. For example, in the case of start-up expenses, should it be an asset or an expense? Article 88 of the implementation rules of the income tax in the United States stipulates that expenses at the time of the company's establishment, such as registration fees, lawyer fees, accountant fees, and all other start-up expenses, are capital expenditures and cannot be deducted from the total income of the current year. In short, the above points should be specified in detail in the implementation rules of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, so as to avoid disputes between merchants and the government, and to ensure that taxation is fair. At the beginning of legislation, the government naturally cannot take care of everything in detail. Furthermore, when the people are not yet accustomed to this new tax, if the regulations are too dense, it may cause a backlash. This is also the difficulty of the legislators. However, in order to avoid disputes between the government and merchants in the future and to ensure fair taxation, it will be necessary to amend it. It is best to supplement the implementation rules with the above points, because the regulations are still provisional regulations and can be amended at any time. According to the Japanese Income Tax Law, from the Meiji 20th year to the present, about 50 years, there have been two major revisions, and there have been more than 20 minor revisions. In the 17 years from 1918 to 1935 in the United States, it was also amended eight times. I also hope that the government's legislative officials will take this as a reference.</p>

<h3>One Year of the Legal Tender</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>It has been one year since the implementation of the legal tender. Over this year, the effectiveness, although currency system reforms cannot be measured for their value in the short term, the visible facts are sufficient to glean some understanding. I will now discuss the achievements of the legal tender over the past year from various perspectives.</p>
<p>(1) Trade Has Indeed Seen Improvement</p>
<p>The original purpose of promoting the legal tender was to unify the issuance of banknotes, centralize bank reserves, preserve silver and prevent its outflow, stabilize foreign exchange rates and prevent fluctuations, increase the flow of domestic capital, and adjust international trade. Since the implementation of the legal tender on November 4th last year, although there have been some minor fluctuations in exchange rates with the British pound and the US dollar, their impact on trade has been minimal. Here is a table showing the trade situation for the past year. (The "past year" referred to in this article runs from October 24 to September 25 because most of the figures for October of this year have not yet been fully settled by early November. The comparison with the same period last year also refers to October 23 to September 24. Figures are in units of 1,000 legal tender dollars.)</p>
<p>Comparing the current year with the same period last year, imports accounted for approximately 92.5% of the same period last year, a decrease of 7.5%. Exports accounted for approximately 129% of the same period last year, an increase of 29%. The trade deficit accounted for approximately 46.5% of the same period last year, a decrease of 53.5%. In December of last year and January of this year, there was a turnaround to a trade surplus. Although this was due to the European and American situation, currency reform also had an impact. If we compare the import and export values from January to September of this year with the same period last year, the import value accounted for approximately 95.8% of the same period last year, a decrease of 4.2%. The export value accounted for approximately 128% of the same period last year, an increase of 28%. The trade deficit accounted for approximately 54.6% of last year, a decrease of approximately 45.4%. However, there is a slight difference when converted into customs gold units. (Unit: 1,000 Customs Gold Units)</p>
<p>Imports decreased by 102,755 thousand Customs Gold Units compared to the same period last year, exports increased by 3,089 thousand Customs Gold Units, and the trade deficit decreased by 105,844 thousand Customs Gold Units.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the increase or decrease in value, among the imports, colored cotton fabrics, other than unbleached fabrics, decreased significantly. As a result, local dyeing and weaving factories in the city that had white greige fabrics available for dyeing have seen reduced imports, rising fabric prices, and hopeful profits. The large decrease in imports of rayon, sugar, and waxes is likely due to the impact of smuggling in the Eastern Hebei region. However, the increase in imports of chemical products, dyes, books, and paper, if all used in industrial and cultural undertakings, is a good sign. As for exports, the export of leather expanded greatly this year, increasing by two-thirds compared to the same period last year. As a result, the price of fur has become very expensive, with retail prices rising by nearly one time. In addition, the export of soybeans and grains was also greater than in previous years. (Grain imports were valued at 129,248,946 yuan in the same period last year, but only 45,626,294 yuan in the nine months of this year.) Cotton increased from 51,918,000 yuan in the same period last year to 69,848,000 yuan in the same period this year. Exports of tung oil and other products increased by more than 33 million yuan, totaling more than 74 million yuan. Mineral exports also increased by more than 7 million yuan, totaling 27.1777 million yuan. In addition to these, all export products, except for animals and their products, have seen considerable increases. However, although smuggling has been prevented, it has been too widespread and has lasted too long. The lower value of imported goods this year compared to last year is also a major reason, which in turn affects customs revenue.</p>
<p>(2) Estimation of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports and Speculation on Overseas Gold Reserves</p>
<p>The activity of gold and silver imports and exports during this year was greater than in the same period last year. However, last year both government and private businesses could transport gold and silver (gold was also not prohibited), while this year only the government can handle it. The situation of gold and silver imports and exports during this year is as follows (unit: 1,000 legal tender dollars):</p>
<p>A Gold</p>
<p>B Silver</p>
<p>It is found that the gold exports this year mostly went to the United Kingdom, while almost all silver went to the United States, and most of the silver imports came from Hong Kong. In short, during these two years (i.e., October 23 to September 25), the net value of gold exports was 34,111,100 yuan, and the net value of silver exports was 352,501,100 yuan, which is a considerable amount. Here are the silver reserves in Shanghai after the implementation of the legal tender last year for comparison. (Units: liang/yuan are in thousands, silver bars are in bars)</p>
<p>According to customs records, the amount of banknote movement this year was 8,456,950 Chinese silver dollars for imported banknotes and 4,585,400 yuan for exported banknotes, which are not included in the above import and export figures. Here is the total amount of silver reserves in Shanghai during this year:</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Daily News of this port on October 7th of this year, Shanghai's silver reserves at the end of August were 140 million yuan. It was also said that since September to the beginning of October, silver worth 52.9 million yuan was shipped to New York and 95.06 million yuan to Hong Kong. The total is 147.96 million yuan. At the same time, 150,000 yuan from Xiamen, 1 million yuan from Jiujiang, 5.2 million yuan from Luoyang, and 70,000 yuan from Wenzhou, totaling 6.62 million yuan, were transported to Shanghai from various places. It was also said that except for the 9 million yuan held by the Japanese Bank, only 2.2 million yuan remained. In fact, the current silver reserve only needs to be 25%, that is, only 250 million yuan is needed in the 610 million yuan of cash reserves, and it should be calculated from a national perspective, so the increase or decrease in silver reserves in Shanghai is not considered important.</p>
<p>Regarding the import and export situation of gold and silver in China in the past, the reporter once compiled the import and export figures of gold and silver for 46 years in mid-April last year and wrote an article entitled "How Much Gold and Silver Does China Still Have?", which was published in the 130th issue of this journal. The following tables are reprinted from it, which will make the quantity of gold and silver in and out of China clearer.</p>
<p>Table 1: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports from the 15th Year of Guangxu (Silver from the 16th Year) to the 17th Year of the Republic of China (Unit: Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Gold Surplus 200,761,920 Silver Surplus 194,931,612</p>
<p>Gold Deficit 104,001,703 Silver Deficit 813,109,039</p>
<p>Net Surplus 96,760,127 Net Deficit 618,177,427</p>
<p>If 1.5 is equivalent to silver coins, then the net gold surplus is worth 145,140,325 yuan, and the net silver deficit is 930,766,140 yuan, with a remaining net deficit of 85,625,815 yuan.</p>
<p>Table 2: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports from the 18th to the 22nd Year of the Republic of China (Unit: National Currency)</p>
<p>Gold Surplus 27,506,760 Silver Surplus 19,952,275</p>
<p>Gold Deficit None Silver Deficit 346,192,827</p>
<p>Net Surplus Net Deficit 326,241,562</p>
<p>Table 3: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China (1934) (Gold is calculated in Customs Taels, Silver is calculated in National Currency)</p>
<p>Gold Imports 5,856 Silver Imports 4,571,543</p>
<p>Gold Exports 26,122,299 Silver Exports 233,345,684</p>
<p>Surplus 26,216,543 Surplus 228,774,141</p>
<p>As for how much gold our country has overseas, it is not something we can know. However, since the banknote silver reserve has been reduced to 25%, and the remaining 35% can be filled with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, all 356 million yuan of the 610 million yuan can be transferred to overseas gold reserves. According to a Reuters New York dispatch on October 20th of this year, "The US Federal Reserve Bank has allocated gold worth 1,975,000 US dollars to foreign accounts, and it is believed that this must be the result of China's sale of silver," which is also evidence of overseas deposits.</p>
<p>(3) Silver Coin Minting Volume of 1.95 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>Since October 4th of last year, the use of hard currency has been stopped, and individuals holding silver coins are limited to exchanging them for legal tender for a period of three months. Subsequently, the period was extended for another three months. After the expiration, the remote provinces were still afraid of not having exchanged them completely, so the extension was appropriately extended, and it was stopped again when it was considered an appropriate time. The influx of Western Mexican silver dollars into China was around the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and it became popular during the Daoguang period. During the Guangxu period, Zhang Zhidong, in his capacity as Governor of Guangdong, first established a factory to mint dragon-patterned silver dollars, which was the beginning of China's silver dollars. Later, various provinces imitated it, and the silver dollar policy became corrupted. In the third year of the Republic of China, the minting of Yuan Shikai head silver coins gradually became unified. Until the Central Mint started minting new silver coins in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and minted both A and B type factory bars, after that only B type factory bars were minted, each bar was worth 1,000 silver dollars. It was completely abolished on November 4th last year, but the factory bars are still being minted. In mid-May of this year, the Sino-American silver agreement was established. In the declaration of maintaining the legal tender issued by the Minister of Finance, there was a statement about minting 50-cent and one-yuan silver coins, but it has not yet started to be minted.</p>
<p>How much has China minted since the dragon-patterned silver dollars? This is also what everyone wants to know. According to official records and statistics, the number is approximately as follows:</p>
<p>According to the above table, the total amount of silver dollars and silver bars (each bar is worth 1,000 yuan) is 1,993,586,737 yuan. This can be regarded as the total amount of silver coins since China has minted its own silver dollars.</p>
<p>(4) Banknote Issuance Before and After the Implementation of Legal Tender</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced on November 4th of last year that "the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender, and their issuance is centralized. Banknotes issued by other banks are still allowed to circulate, but should be gradually withdrawn and replaced with Central Bank banknotes. Hereafter, each bank shall not continue to issue new banknotes, and all printed but unissued banknotes shall be deposited with the Central Bank." As a result, the issuance of banknotes by various banks in China began to be centralized. Before the implementation of legal tender, in Shanghai alone, in addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, there were seven other banks, such as the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, that issued banknotes. The situation of banknote issuance by various banks before the implementation of legal tender is listed in the table on the left (unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>
<p>The total number of banknotes issued by all banks was 419.58 million yuan, and all of them were taken over by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. However, the Farmers Bank of China was specially authorized by the Central Government to issue another 100 million yuan. The issuance amount of banknotes by various banks after the implementation of legal tender is listed below: (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>The total amount of legal tender issued by the three banks in October of this year was 961,528,000 yuan. If the banknote issuance amount of the three banks in the same period last year is used as 100%, then the ratio obtained in October of this year should be 229.5%, which is an increase of one time and 29.5%. If the banknote issuance amount of the three banks in November last year is compared with the issuance amount in October this year, the results are as follows: (%)</p>
<p>Central 202.6 China 165.4 Communications 170.5</p>
<p>The increase in Central Bank banknotes is the most, with more than one time, and the rate of increase of China and Communications is similar. If the Farmers Bank of China compares its banknote issuance amount in September of this year with that of October last year, it has increased by 362.9%. It is said that the amount exceeding the limit is said to be that the issuance amount of supplementary currency coupons is not within the limit of 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>As for the issuance reserves of the three banks, as of October of this year, they all exceed the statutory reserve of more than 60%.</p>
<p>On May 17th of this year, Minister of Finance Kong also issued a declaration to maintain the legal tender. The measures are:</p>
<p>(1) In order to fully maintain the credit of the legal tender, the government's cash reserve part is still filled with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and the minimum silver reserve should account for 25% of the total issuance amount.</p>
<p>(2) In order to facilitate merchants and people, the government will mint half-yuan and one-yuan silver coins to complete the types of hard currency.</p>
<p>(3) In order to enhance the consolidation of the legal tender's position, the government's cash reserves have already raised huge sums, and gold and foreign exchange will be fully increased.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the composition of the cash reserve for banknote issuance has been slightly changed to meet the actual needs.</p>
<p>It was difficult to unify the promotion of the legal tender at the beginning, because Guangdong and Guangxi still used hao yang (small silver coins). However, in August of this year, Guangdong succeeded in unification and also switched to using legal tender. There is a saying that Guangxi will implement it on November 1st.</p>
<p>(5) New Subsidiary Currency Emerges</p>
<p>Since the legal tender has been implemented, the subsidiary currency has also been reformed. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that 12 silver cents or 300 copper coins are legally equivalent to one legal tender yuan. Each large ocean (silver dollar) is equivalent to 300 wen. The exchange rate of large oceans on the market is that each yuan can be exchanged for 10 silver cents, 470-480 or even 360-370 wen, and each cent is exchanged for 240-250 wen. Before the new subsidiary currency was issued, one-cent and two-cent subsidiary currency coupons from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and Zhejiang local banks were still in circulation. On February 12th of this year, half-cent and one-cent copper subsidiary currency and five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent nickel subsidiary currency were issued. However, because our country is vast, the demand for small-denomination subsidiary currency is very large. Taking the Central Bank as an example, subsidiary currency coupons accounted for 35.75 million yuan of the 305.83 million yuan issued in October of this year. Other banks such as the China, Communications, Farmers, and Zhejiang banks have not yet been included. However, provincial governments often use the excuse of maintaining domestic prices to request the issuance of subsidiary currency coupons, ranging from 2 to 3 million yuan. Recently, it has been heard that the Ministry of Finance intends to uniformly handle the printing procedures of coupons by the central government to prevent counterfeiting and to facilitate investigation. Since the new subsidiary currency was issued in February of this year, the number of coins minted by the Central Mint as of September is shown in the following table (unit: 10,000 coins):</p>
<p>Converted into legal tender according to the above minting numbers: (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>20-cent coins 7,130,000</p>
<p>10-cent coins 5,050,000</p>
<p>5-cent coins 2,928,000</p>
<p>1-cent coins 1,982,400</p>
<p>Half-cent coins 213,200</p>
<p>Total 17,303,600</p>
<p>However, it is still not enough to distribute, so the Ministry of Finance has proposed to restore the three mints in Wuchang, Xi'an, and Anqing to mint subsidiary currency. In Tianjin, the minting of subsidiary currency was once started but eventually stopped. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requested that 2.5-cent copper coins be added to facilitate small change, but it has not been approved.</p>
<p>The maintenance of the legal price of subsidiary currency, before the old subsidiary currency (silver cents and copper coins) is completely recovered, how to adjust it should be carefully considered. However, since the exchange price of old subsidiary currency has been stipulated, Shanghai has been able to maintain it. However, the recent black market price of silver cents is 11 cents and 7 cents (per yuan), and the black market price of copper coins is 301.5 wen (per 100 yuan), which has already deviated. Zhejiang Province is also worried about the flooding of copper coins, and there is a danger that the legal price cannot be maintained. The Provincial Federation of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for relief. In short, it is all because the new subsidiary currency is not enough to circulate, so the old subsidiary currency is difficult to recover, and the adjustment of various banks seems to be lacking, resulting in this phenomenon. Therefore, the three banks in various places, China, Communications, and Central, should follow the original plan of the Ministry to handle the exchange price at any time, so as to promote the actual implementation and benefit the people.</p>
<p>(6) Currency Price Changes and Price Increases</p>
<p>The visible impact of currency price changes is the rise and fall of prices. Since the implementation of legal tender, prices have risen. Here are the wholesale prices in Shanghai, the prices of imports and exports, and the wholesale price indices in North China and Guangzhou to get a glimpse.</p>
<p>The above indices all take the 15th year of the Republic of China as 100%. From the price indices of the three parts of the country, North, South, and Central, it can be seen that after the implementation of the legal tender, prices have increased significantly. For example, the Shanghai wholesale price index in November 24 was 9.3 higher than in October, and both imports and exports were 9.0 higher. The Guangzhou wholesale price index was 10.37 higher, and North China was 6.68 higher. Later, it increased month by month, but the trend was still stable, which shows the stabilizing power of currency prices. As far as Shanghai is concerned, the export price, except for July, has not yet reached the average price of the 15th year of the Republic of China. Exported goods are all native goods, and the most sharply increased prices are raw materials, agricultural products, and animal products. The increase in production and consumer goods is still slight. Imported prices have risen sharply due to the impact of rising foreign exchange rates. The new exchange rate of one legal tender against the British pound is one shilling and two and a half pence, while one silver dollar of national currency weighs 26.6971 grams and has a fineness of 880, which is equivalent to 23.493448 grams of pure silver. According to the London silver price at that time (when the legal tender was implemented) of 29 pence and 4375 per ounce, it was worth 23 pence and 49375, but now one legal tender yuan is only worth 14 pence and 5, a decrease of 9 pence, a devaluation of about 65%. As a result, the import price index was affected, and it rose sharply from 123.7 in October 24 to 142.7, an increase of 19%. However, it has since fluctuated around 140, which shows the stability of the exchange rate. Therefore, the United Kingdom has recently established an export credit loan department to China to develop trade with China. We can also make some contributions and do not have to urgently transport cash. Japan has followed suit and will also set up an export credit loan to compete with British merchants, and we are a market for promoting goods. However, our construction is in full swing, and there are many places where foreign capital is needed. If the imported goods are mostly materials for our construction and used to generate profits, we will welcome them.</p>
<p>(7) Price Increases and Production Increases</p>
<p>Price increases can develop industry and commerce and promote the quantity of production. However, our country's situation is special. It is not only the tail end of foreign goods sales, but also after the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Shimonoseki, foreign merchants opened factories in treaty ports, holding their special power and position, which is more superior to Chinese merchants. For 40 years, it has become a situation of guests bullying the host. Therefore, this time, the implementation of the legal tender, our country's industry, has received a considerable stimulus, but foreign merchants' factories have received even more benefits. For example, in mid-to-late October of this year, yarn and flowers soared. A Japanese factory earned 100 yuan in profit per package of yarn and more than 40 yuan in profit per package of yarn, and the textile industry in North China was almost completely taken over by them. They still want to expand it. I am really worried about the future of my country's industry. Here is the China Production Index compiled by the Central Bank to see what benefits the industry has received.</p>
<p>(8) Cost of Living in Rapidly Rising</p>
<p>Price increases can also increase the burden on general life. This year, necessities in general life, such as tofu, soybean oil, pork, fish, and even vegetables, have all risen, and the increase is almost one time. In addition, flour, wheat, rice, fabrics, wool, shirts, socks, thread, blankets, coal balls, white coal, rubber, candy, food, and all daily necessities are all rising one after another. This is not surprising. Wholesale prices have risen, and retail prices will naturally follow. Therefore, the future livelihood problem is worthy of serious attention. Here is a table of (A) the Shanghai cost of living index and (B) the Shanghai workers' cost of living index.</p>
<p>Time (A) Index (B) Index</p>
<p>October 24 103.9 97.54</p>

<p>The above is only general and has not been discussed in detail, and it is already long, which is not allowed by the length of this publication. However, since the legal tender has this achievement, I deeply hope that it will go further to achieve the goal of matching the national budget revenue and expenditure and complete the production and construction plan.</p>

<h3>Securities Last Week's Government Bonds Did Not Have Major Transactions December Has Been On the Market But Is Not Very Lively</h3>
<p>From October 26th to 31st last week, the market conditions of the Chinese Securities Exchange only had slight fluctuations due to the approaching delivery relationship. The rest was in a state of circling and sluggishness. Although the December futures have been newly listed on the market, they are not very lively. Most people are watching. Since the reform of unified government bonds, trading has greatly declined, and most of the financial community has no transactions. Most of the big speculators have left. The scope of market trading is shrinking day by day, so without major changes in the environment, it is not easy to shake the market. At present, the situation is chaotic and repeatedly brewing, and the bond market is also tending to be flat. If you want the bond market to restore its former prosperity, I am afraid it is not something that can be expected in the current financial situation. Last week's experience: Monday was the last day of futures trading in October. Due to mutual infighting, there was a slight squeeze. The forward price was relatively high. The market price rose by 1 to 6 cents. On Tuesday, only November futures were traded for one month, and the trading volume decreased greatly. The market was also very stable. On Wednesday, December futures were added. Although all of them were opened, the trading was still very ordinary. The trading situation was flat, and the price was slightly higher by 1 or 2 cents. Thursday was the delivery of October futures, and the market was closed for one day. On Friday, the trading still did not improve, and the market was still circling, mostly slightly tired by 5 cents to 3 corners. On Saturday, the trading was surprisingly quiet, people's hearts were scattered, and it continued to be tired by 1 or 2 corners. At present, the large-scale military exercises by the Japanese army in North China are enough to cause misunderstandings. There are many thorns in the future. As a result of the market price for one week, most of them rose slightly by 1 to 3 corners, but Type A alone rose by 5 or 6 corners. The total number of transactions: the current futures totaled 22,127,000 yuan. Here is a table of the results of its rise and fall for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Food Dumplings Are Difficult to Sell New Thin Rice Slumped 3-4 Corners The Source Is Rushing... Remaining Goods Are Accumulating</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Er) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs saw more rushing, with a total of 767 numbers, with a total of 15,3400 stones. People's hearts are tired, and the market situation is even more difficult to improve. The market price is stepping down. The new thin rice Qingdao Yantai and other gangs continued to handle more than 5,000 packages, but the source is very strong, and the remaining goods are accumulating, which makes the decline of the market even more intense. As a result, it continued to fall by 3, 4, and 5 corners. Although the arrival of thick new japonica rice is not much, the price fell by another 5 cents due to the lack of sales. Although Du Yangjian's rural land is strong, it is inevitably affected by the sharp drop in thin rice. Now it is a high, fixed, medium, and tired situation, and Yinyuan is even more difficult to stand, and it has fallen by nearly a foot. (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, more than 40 numbers arrived from various roads under the river. The market has a poor appetite for various goods. The price of new japonica rice is tired by a few cents. In addition to the short corners in the price of Yinyuan, the price of early rice is a small 1 corner 6.7 points. The price of thin rice package stomach stop handling, and the street also stays down by a small 2.3 corners. The prices of Yang Du Bu Kejian, etc. have not risen or fallen.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Fluctuations in Overseas Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with varying prices, falling four points to rising one point in each month's contract. Trading was sluggish, mostly for liquidation purposes. Later, near-month contracts strengthened due to buying by peers. Spot demand was relatively loose, and the cloth market was also slow. If the shipping strike extends to the Atlantic coast, the cotton market may be somewhat affected. At closing, peer limit-price buying provided slight stability. Spot prices rose two points, futures rose two points to falling six points. English cotton spot prices rose three points, futures fell three points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to exporter buying but weakened later due to long position liquidation. At closing, short covering occurred, resulting in no change for Fine Gor, Omra fell half a rupee, and White Western fell 0.25 rupee. Original Telegraph Left (Dated 31st)</p>

<h3>Report on the Fiscal Situation for the 23rd Year of the Republic and Thereafter</h3>
<p>Previously, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee and the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Xiangxi presented reports on the government's fiscal situation up to November 1, 1935, and July 10, 1936, respectively. Now, a comprehensive report is prepared on the financial situation during the 23rd fiscal year (from July 1934 to June 30, 1935) and thereafter for your public review.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspect of the fiscal situation during this period was the currency reform. Recalling that since the increase in the price of silver, silver continued to flow out. To preserve currency reserves, prevent the appreciation of exchange rates, and counter deflation, the Ministry implemented a silver export tax on October 14, 1934. Xiangxi has already described the details of this process in last year's financial report. However, while this measure could help achieve the above objectives, it was not a fundamental solution. Although the exchange rate did not increase as sharply as the price of silver, it continued to rise, and the phenomenon of domestic deflation intensified daily. The price index fell to a low of 90-92 between June and September 1935. Furthermore, because of unstable exchange rates, commerce was greatly affected. The government was thus compelled to adopt fundamental currency reform.</p>
<p>On November 3, 1935, the government announced the implementation of the legal tender (fapi) decree, stipulating that banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender. Anyone holding silver was required to exchange it for fapi immediately. To stabilize the exchange rate of fapi at the prevailing level, the three banks were required to buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. The plan also included reorganizing the Central Bank of China into the Central Reserve Bank and other banking reforms, as well as aligning national budget revenues and expenditures.</p>
<p>The currency reform can be said to have met expectations, and domestic and foreign public opinion has generally praised it. The Shanghai price index increased from 90.5 in July 1935 to 106.1 in June 1936, indicating that deflation had been curbed. The stability of the exchange rate was unprecedented, benefiting the national economy and general commerce significantly. Since the currency reform, the foreign exchange reserves of fapi have greatly increased due to the sale of silver to the US government. Domestically, since November 3, 1935, the reserves have been further strengthened by the Currency Reserve Committee's receipt of 225,000,000 yuan in silver. Recently, the political situation in the Southwest has improved, and currency reform should be extended to that region, further advancing financial unification.</p>
<p>Regarding coinage, important reforms were also adopted. The newly minted subsidiary coins, nickel coins in denominations of twenty cents, ten cents, and five cents, and copper coins in denominations of one cent and half a cent, were put into circulation in February of this year. The Central Mint has recently increased its efforts to mint the aforementioned subsidiary coins, with the aim of withdrawing the existing various subsidiary currencies, whether paper or copper, as soon as possible. In addition, it is planned to mint one-yuan and fifty-cent silver coins, which will be minted and issued as soon as preparations are complete.</p>
<p>The necessary next step in reforming the currency system is to establish the Central Reserve Bank. Once established, it will be the sole agency for issuing legal tender and the nation's only reserve depository, enabling it to control finance and lending, regulate the operations of banks nationwide, and stabilize the international value of the national currency.</p>
<p>During this period, budget revenues and expenditures continued to be insufficient. The reasons for this were nothing more than the economic panic, unstable currency, uncertain overseas situation, and sharp decline in international trade, resulting in a shortfall in customs revenue. The customs and salt taxes of the four northeastern provinces could not be used to repay foreign debts. Furthermore, smuggling and tax evasion in North China have become increasingly serious since the autumn of 1935. Although strict laws have been enforced, customs officials in the north are still unable to enforce the law against the illegal activities of foreigners enjoying consular jurisdiction, leading to even more rampant smuggling. The loss in tax revenue is as high as 2,000,000 yuan per week. Moreover, the dumping of smuggled goods has significantly harmed the national economy and the businesses of legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants.</p>
<p>To offset the loss of revenue, it has been necessary to improve tax administration, reorganize or merge tax collection agencies to reduce expenses and improve administration. Since implementation, this has been quite effective, and financial administration expenses have been reduced compared to the past. Compared to tax revenue, the ratio was 11% in 1931, 9.9% in 1932 and 1933, and 9.2% in 1934 and 1935.</p>
<p>In addition, the implementation of appropriate new taxes is also under study, which could increase national revenue and balance budget revenues and expenditures. Income tax regulations have already been drafted and will be promulgated and implemented soon. Inheritance tax is also being planned. The government's intention in implementing new taxes remains to avoid increasing the burden on the people and hindering the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce.</p>
<p>Expenditures were substantial during this period, primarily due to disaster relief for floods, the restoration of disaster areas, the bailout of banks and industrial and commercial enterprises, and subsidies to provincial and local governments, as well as bandit suppression. However, even during this difficult financial time, the government endeavored to increase funding for education and construction and to subsidize provincial governments in implementing rural reconstruction policies. Funding for the National Economic Council continued to be allocated for construction and for managing the nation's water conservancy. The government also made great efforts to assist provincial financial reforms, most notably in Sichuan Province. The province's financial chaos cannot be denied, but the government took the lead in reforming the currency system, reorganizing debt, abolishing various harsh taxes, and stabilizing finances. It is estimated that the revenue and expenditure amounts in its 1936-1937 budget should be offset.</p>
<p>Given the aforementioned circumstances, a budget deficit in 1934 was unavoidable. As of June 30, 1935, the total deficit was approximately 196,000,000 yuan. Excluding the 73,500,000 yuan subscribed for the bailout of banks, the actual shortfall was 122,500,000 yuan. According to preliminary estimates, the budget deficit for 1935 will unfortunately be even greater than in the previous year.</p>
<p>In January 1936, the government agreed with bondholders to reorganize domestic debt, agreeing on a plan to issue unified government bonds, divided into five types, with a total value of 146,000,000 yuan, to exchange for 33 types of previously issued government bonds. The main points of the amendment were to extend the repayment period. According to this plan, annual debt service costs can be reduced by 85,000,000 yuan. At the same time, a reconstruction bond of 34,000,000 yuan was issued to consolidate national finances and make up for budget deficits.</p>
<p>During this period, efforts to reorganize various accumulated debts were particularly active. In February 1936, the 1908-1910 Tianjin-Pukou Railway loan, guaranteed by railway and customs revenues, was announced for reorganization. In addition, other railway loans were also being reorganized. The government hopes to continue reorganizing other debts. Recognizing that the reorganization of state-owned railways is closely related to financial construction and the restoration of national credit, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways jointly handled matters related to railway reconstruction and the reorganization of old debts. In the spring of 1935, a foreign engineer with extensive experience in railway administration was hired to come to China to study the conditions of our railways. His opinions were highly valuable and contributed greatly to the improvement of our railways.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the financial situation. Now, I will report separately on the affairs under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Central Government Revenue and Expenditure</h3>
<p>The following revenue and expenditure table is compiled based on reports received by the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance in the 23rd fiscal year. The fiscal year ended in June 1935. Items for which revenue and expenditure occurred before July 1, but reports were received after July 1, are included in the table. Revenue and expenditure items before June 30 for which reports had not been received by that time are not included in the table.</p>

<h3>Customs</h3>
<p>The revised customs import tariff began to be implemented in July 1934. This new tariff reduced taxes on plain cloth and certain other goods while increasing taxes on metals, machinery, and chemicals. Although the tax rates on the latter items were increased, the principle was that their sales markets would not be severely affected. The purpose of revising the tariff was to increase tax revenue and protect domestic production and manufacturing industries. Export tax rates were also revised once in June 1934, with most goods' tax rates being reduced. However, due to the treasury deficit and other financial difficulties, the government was ultimately unable to implement its planned reduction of export taxes and abolition of transit taxes during the period from 1935 to 1936. The previous year's report stated that since April 6, 1933, a 2.25% ad valorem tax had been levied on exports of various types of silver, but exports of silver dollars and ingots were not taxed. Since October 1934, a 7.75% export tax was also levied on silver dollars and ingots, along with a 10% tax on other exported silver, plus an export equalization tax to compensate for the difference between the London silver price and the official exchange rate. These various protective measures were to prevent the outflow of domestic silver due to high silver prices in foreign markets. Silver smuggling has now stopped, as foreign silver prices have recently fallen.</p>
<p>Regarding the surtax on imports and exports (with tax rates of 5% of the import and export taxes, respectively), the portion for disaster relief continued to be collected during this period, and the portion for subsidizing finances was extended for another year from July 1936. Customs anti-smuggling efforts were strengthened this year. There are seventy-five large and small anti-smuggling patrol vessels, which are sufficient to prevent common coastal and border smuggling. However, since the autumn of 1935, customs patrol vessels in eastern Hebei Province have faced armed resistance and been disarmed, suffering a major setback. Smuggled goods have converged in the north and cannot be stopped. The loss in tax revenue is approximately 2,000,000 yuan per week. Now, the only option is to set up anti-smuggling stations along the railway lines to prevent smuggled goods from entering.</p>
<p>The total customs revenue from the first year of the Republic to 1935 is listed by year below:</p>
<p>Year | Total Tax Revenue (Including Tonnage Dues)</p>
<p>---|---</p>
<p>Republic Year 1 | 66,743,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 2 | 73,069,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 3 | 65,914,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 4 | 63,149,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 5 | 64,674,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 6 | 65,381,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 7 | 62,817,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 8 | 78,684,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 9 | 84,451,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 10 | 91,899,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 11 | 98,079,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 12 | 105,935,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 13 | 115,052,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 14 | 116,224,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 15 | 128,733,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 16 | 112,985,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 17 | 133,940,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 18 | 245,226,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 19 | 291,697,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 20 | 386,912,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 21 | 287,888,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 22 | 311,260,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 23 | 306,186,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic Year 24 | 288,425,000 yuan</p>
<p>The total revenue from various customs duties in the most recent three years, including disaster relief and other surtaxes not listed in the above table, is as follows:</p>
<p>When observing the above tax revenue figures, the following points must be noted:</p>
<p>(1) The normal customs office ceased operations in 1931.</p>
<p>(2) In January 1931, likin, restored import duties, and inland transit duties were abolished.</p>
<p>(3) In 1932, the customs offices in the three northeastern provinces and Dalian were occupied.</p>
<p>Import tax revenue in 1935 increased by 4,880,000 customs gold units compared to 1934. However, due to the high price of silver that year, the actual silver dollar revenue decreased by 10,050,000 yuan. Since the currency reform in November 1935, the exchange rate of customs gold units has increased, so the actual silver dollar revenue has also increased accordingly. The high customs gold unit revenue in 1935 was due to the increase in some tariff rates in the new import tariff of 1934, as imports were still 10% lower than before. On the other hand, although export tax revenue decreased due to lower tax rates, exports increased by 7.6% compared to 1934. Based on the current situation and the low exchange rate of the national currency, there seems to be even more hope for increased exports this year.</p>
<h3>Salt Administration</h3>
<p>During the period covered by this report, the salt administration progressed steadily, and revenue increased. The improvements were particularly important in anti-smuggling and salt field management. However, the growth of native salt production has greatly impacted official sales. A few years ago, only six counties produced native salt, but according to surveys, as many as 158 counties now produce it. If native salt sales are allowed to flourish, salt tax revenue will be greatly affected. The annual tax revenue in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces is expected to decrease by millions of yuan. To enable official sales to compete with native and private sales, salt taxes have been gradually reduced, and irrigation projects have been undertaken to improve the soil, so that areas producing native salt can resume cultivation. In Hebei Province, a reorganization fee is collected specifically for this work, and in Henan Province, 30,000 yuan is allocated monthly from July 1934. At the same time, various suppression methods have been used, and approximately 300,000 native salt cooking pools have been destroyed in Hebei Province by the end of 1934. In Henan Province, more river channels have been dredged to facilitate cultivation. The opened canals have reached 344 kilometers. This work is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Salt field management work has also continued to develop. In addition to building salt warehouses, the salt field management system has been improved daily. Areas such as Changlu, Huaibei, and Shandong all have enclosure walls, highways, tax police stations, and telephone equipment to facilitate anti-smuggling.</p>
<p>The unification of salt administration has made further progress this year. The salt administration and anti-smuggling agencies in Sichuan were brought under the management of the Salt Revenue Inspection Office in April 1935. Sales of saltpeter and sulfur, which have been managed by salt administration agencies since 1933, have also been improving.</p>
<p>The foreign debt quotas, excluding the three northeastern provinces, have been remitted on schedule by all salt revenue inspection offices nationwide. The salt administration agencies in Sichuan have also resumed remitting quotas since May 1935. Therefore, the principal and interest of loans guaranteed by salt tax have been paid on schedule, and credit has become increasingly stable. The arrears of the 1908 Anglo-French loan were paid off in October 1934. The repayment of a portion of the principal arrears of the 1912 Crisp Loan has also begun.</p>
<p>Regarding salt tax revenue, although silver was extremely tight and various regions experienced floods in the past year, the revenue in 1935 actually increased by 8,259,000 yuan compared to 1934. The annual revenue of the General Salt Revenue Inspection Office from the second year of the Republic to 1935 is listed below:</p>

<h3>Tax Affairs</h3>
<p>The items subject to consolidated tax collection currently include nine types: cigarettes, cotton yarn, wheat flour, matches, cement, cured tobacco, beer, minerals, and spirits. Spirits were previously taxed under ordinary alcoholic beverages. Since January 1, 1936, consolidated taxes have been implemented, and appropriate tax rates have been established to promote the development of the spirits industry and increase tax revenue. The consolidated taxation of aerated water is also being planned. Since the implementation of consolidated taxes on cured tobacco leaves, tax revenue has increased sharply. Unfortunately, due to the lack of strict management in tobacco-producing areas, private transportation and sales are widespread, leading to the prevalence of handmade cigarettes by private individuals in these areas, which are difficult to investigate and suppress, hindering the business of legitimate merchants and significantly affecting national tax revenue. To fundamentally reorganize this situation, a method for the consolidated control of tobacco leaves has been drafted, allowing the government to control the distribution of tobacco leaves. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and is currently being prepared for implementation. The reorganization of the existing taxes is also continuing. For example, in recent years, smuggled, counterfeit, and tax-evading imported matches made privately overseas have flooded the market. To curb smuggling, the method of affixing flower stickers to match packages will be implemented in 1936 to facilitate investigation and suppression. The mineral taxes in Sichuan and Hunan provinces have been recovered and are now directly collected by the Ministry of Finance after consultation with the provincial governments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the production and sale of native wine are scattered and disorganized, and tax rates vary from province to province. Although repeated reorganizations have been carried out, a thorough reform has not been achieved. It is now planned to first abolish the current complex tax rates on Jiangsu shaojiu, Zhejiang shaojiu, and Shanxi fenjiu, which are produced and sold in large quantities, and implement a single tax collection method to achieve unification. At the same time, efforts will be redoubled on other plans that have already been initiated to gradually advance them to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Tax administration has traditionally established separate agencies to manage various tax revenues, making it difficult to achieve thorough reorganization. From 1936 onward, it has been decided to reorganize and merge the various consolidated tax, mineral tax, and tobacco and alcohol tax agencies within the same region. The provinces and cities nationwide will be divided into several districts, each with a district tax bureau as the supervisory agency. Underneath it will be tax management offices and tax branch offices responsible for investigation and collection. However, for gradual implementation, a trial will be conducted first in the five provinces of Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan from October 1, 1936. The provinces that have not yet been reorganized will continue to be reorganized by the Taxation Administration, and supervisors and inspectors will be dispatched to improve the situation as needed and promote unification.</p>
<h3>Local Finances</h3>
<p>Recalling that the Second National Financial Conference was convened in May 1934, and a plan for reorganizing local finances was resolved. The abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, the reduction of surcharges on land taxes, the holding of land registration, and the determination of local budgets have all gradually achieved results over the past two years, which is quite gratifying. This is not only due to the efforts of the Ministry of Finance in urging and supervising, but also to the sincere cooperation of the provincial and municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Recently, the financial situation in the provinces has improved significantly, especially in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. The central government, to the best of its ability, has been assisting the provinces in reorganizing their finances and balancing their budgets. At the same time, it has provided as much assistance as possible to rural construction in the provinces. The most effective province in reorganizing its finances is Sichuan. When the central government advanced to suppress the communist bandits, the financial situation in Sichuan was extremely chaotic. Afterwards, as the political situation gradually stabilized, financial reform followed. The Ministry of Finance made every effort to unify the currency system and reorganize the old debts in the province. Consequently, three thousand yuan of Sichuan Financial Reorganization Treasury Bonds and seventy million yuan of Post-Disaster Rehabilitation Bonds were issued one after another. The 1936 Sichuan budget has been approved by the central government and can be balanced.</p>
<p>Seventeen provinces and four cities (Note 1) have submitted their 1935 preliminary budgets to the Ministry of Finance. Nine provinces and one city (Note 2) have submitted their 1936 preliminary budgets to the Ministry of Finance. No less than one thousand and fifty-nine counties (Note 3) have submitted their 1935 preliminary budgets to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>As of the date of this report, the total amount of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies abolished and surcharges on land taxes reduced by the provinces and cities has reached 51,000,000 yuan. As for the reorganization of land tax districts, land registration has been conducted in many areas, and further progress is expected.</p>

<h3>Debt</h3>
<p>Since July 1, 1934, in addition to the Unified Bonds and Reconstruction Bonds issued in early 1936, the following types of public bonds were issued by the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>Date of Issue　Name　Amount</p>
<p>April 1, 1935　Financial Bonds　100,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>June 30, 1935　Customs Bonds　100,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>July 1, 1935　Sichuan Rehabilitation Bonds　70,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>August 1, 1935　Consolidation of Sichuan Financial Treasury Notes　30,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>November 1, 1935　Flood Relief and Work Relief Bonds　20,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>April 1, 1936　Sichuan Rehabilitation Bonds　15,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total 335,000,000</p>
<p>In addition, there were Railway Construction Bonds of 120,000,000 yuan, jointly issued by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance, used to construct railways connecting Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi provinces, and to extend the Ping-Sui and Zheng-Tai Railways. One-third of the total amount of the bond was issued in May of this year. The principal and interest fund will be allocated from the income of the newly built and extended railways, and the surplus funds from other state-owned railways used to repay existing debts, with additional subsidies from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>During this period, the most significant reform regarding public bonds was the unification of domestic debt. The method was agreed upon by both the government and bondholders and implemented on February 1st of this year. This method not only changed the organization of public bonds but also simplified their types. The method used five types of Unified Bonds, with a total value of 1,460,000,000 yuan, to redeem the 33 types of public bonds previously issued. Although the interest rate remained at 6%, the repayment period was extended from 12 to 24 years. The repayment periods for various public bonds previously issued were mostly shorter, with approximately 70% due within six years. Therefore, the unified method could reduce annual debt expenses by approximately 85,000,000 yuan compared to the previous regulations, greatly benefiting the balancing of the budget.</p>
<p>The unification method included all previously issued domestic public bonds, treasury notes, and various certificates issued by the National Government, with the following exceptions:</p>
<p>(1) Short-term Rehabilitation Bonds. These bonds matured in March 1936. (2) 1928 Financial Long-Term Bonds. These bonds had an annual interest rate of 2.5% and matured in 1953. (3) Haihe Bonds. (4) 1935 Sichuan Rehabilitation Bonds. Although the third and fourth types of public bonds were issued by the central government, their funds were secured by local revenue and were considered local loans. The amount of the above four types of public bonds accounted for only 8% of the total unified debt.</p>
<p>The old public bonds were divided into five categories based on their repayment periods to facilitate the exchange of various unified public bonds. The procedures for exchanging bonds were completed on June 30th of this year.</p>
<p>The issuance of 6% Reconstruction Bonds of 340,000,000 yuan was also part of the unification method. This was intended to strengthen the financial position, meet the needs of construction, and cover budget deficits. These bonds were planned to be issued gradually over one or two years.</p>
<p>Postponement of Repayment of Commodity Loans from 1931 and 1933. On May 28th of this year, the government, with the agreement of the US authorities, signed a contract to combine the 1931 Flood Relief Loan and the 1933 Cotton and Wheat Loan into one loan, totaling US$16,608,329.99, and extended its repayment period. The Flood Relief Loan, consisting of 450,000 tons of American wheat and flour, was originally valued at US$9,212,826.56, for the relief of the 1931 Yangtze River flood and reconstruction in the disaster areas. Two-thirds, or US$6,141,884.36, had already been repaid. The remaining US$3,070,942.20 was due on December 31st of this year. The Cotton and Wheat Loan totaled US$17,086,282.48, of which US$3,548,894.69 had been repaid before May 28th of this year. The entire loan was used for construction, reconstruction, and other purposes. The loan was originally scheduled to be repaid within three years, but when the contract was signed in 1933, both parties suggested a two-year extension. According to the original contract, the principal repayment for the above two loans was to be US$8,630,000 in 1936 and US$8,421,000 in 1937. The government, due to the ongoing currency reform, hoped to temporarily reduce the burden of foreign debt, and therefore requested an extension of the repayment period, which was fortunately supported by the US authorities. The revised repayment schedule is as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>1936 US$ 1,351,007</p>
<p>1937 US$ 2,000,000</p>
<p>1938 US$ 2,500,000</p>
<p>1939 US$ 2,800,000</p>
<p>1940 US$ 2,800,000</p>
<p>1941 US$ 2,800,000</p>
<p>1942 US$ 2,800,000</p>
<p>Total US$ 17,051,007</p>
<p>According to the contract signed on May 28th of this year, the government was able to reduce the amount of principal repayment in recent years, which greatly benefited public finances.</p>
<p>Settlement of Old Debts The long-standing issue of old debts from the Jinpu Railway loan signed between 1908 and 1910 was resolved on February 25th of this year after lengthy negotiations. Although the loan contract designated Jinpu Railway revenue as the primary guarantee, it also stipulated that customs revenue could be used as collateral. Therefore, the government also used customs revenue as a guarantee for the interest on the loan during this settlement to maintain its reputation.</p>
<p>At the same time, a considerable number of old railway loans were also settled. The most notable examples include loans for the Pinghan Railway, the Nanxun Railway, and the Henan Railway.</p>
<p>The government continues to pay attention to this complex issue of old debts, and deeply hopes to settle all other old debts in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of the government's major foreign debts have been rising in overseas markets, reflecting the government's policy of consolidating national debt credit, which has achieved tangible results and is gratifying.</p>
<h3>Central Bank</h3>
<p>During this period, the development of the Central Bank has been rapidly changing. This can be seen from the table below.</p>
<p>During this period, in addition to continuing to provide the government with various domestic and foreign conveniences, the Central Bank was able to actively perform the duties of a central bank. When financial turmoil occurred frequently and the social economy was unstable, the bank, in close cooperation with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, advocated emergency measures to provide strong assistance to commercial banks. Since the implementation of restrictions on the export of silver in October 1934, the bank has consistently worked hard to stabilize foreign exchange rates, with significant results.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender policy on November 3, 1935, the government has been urged to control the total amount of legal tender in circulation nationwide and the lending activities of domestic banks in order to stabilize the new monetary system. During the silver standard era, the export or import of silver always had the effect of regulating the market, balancing China's internal and external economic conditions. However, now that circumstances have changed, achieving proper financial regulation requires the authorities responsible for implementing monetary policy to pay close attention and plan carefully at all times.</p>
<p>The original text of the new monetary policy announced on November 3, 1935, stated: "The Central Bank, currently state-owned, should be reorganized into a Central Reserve Bank in the future. Its main capital should be provided by various banks and the public, so that it becomes a detached institution capable of maintaining the stability of the national currency with all its might. The Central Reserve Bank should keep the reserve funds of various banks, manage the national treasury, and store all public funds, and provide rediscounting facilities to various banks. The Central Reserve Bank does not engage in ordinary commercial banking business, but will enjoy the exclusive right of issuance after two years."</p>
<p>In February of this year, Xiang Xi suggested to the Executive Yuan that 60% of the Central Bank's government shares be transferred to commercial shares to meet social needs and demonstrate joint ownership with the people. At the same time, a special committee was organized to plan the reorganization of the bank into a Central Reserve Bank. The committee has conducted thorough research and submitted a report, which is currently being carefully considered by the government authorities. Xiang Xi sincerely hopes to see the early realization of the new bank.</p>
<h3>Central Bank</h3>
<h3>Currency</h3>
<p>Weighing the needs of modern countries and adapting to China's unique economic situation, the government's monetary policy aims to achieve a unified and sound currency system. The establishment of the Central Bank in 1928, the opening of the Central Mint in 1929, the abolition of the tael and the introduction of the yuan in 1933, the preparations for currency reform, and the implementation of the new currency system on November 2, 1935, are all steps to complete the monetary policy.</p>
<p>The implementation of the silver export tax in October 1934, to control the outflow of silver and prevent foreign exchange from fluctuating with foreign silver prices, was described in detail in the previous report. Without such measures, the silver reserves used to maintain the currency system would have been exhausted long ago. The catastrophic fall in prices would have been unimaginable. Considering Hong Kong, where there were no restrictions on the export of silver, the wholesale price index fell to 69.4 in August 1935, while the Shanghai wholesale price index only fell to 93.2 in the same month (both using the 1922 average as 100). This further illustrates the importance of collecting silver export tax. However, although this measure can be effective for a time, it is not a fundamental solution for stabilizing finance. Since its implementation, the smuggling of silver has not stopped, foreign exchange has continued to rise, currency has become tighter, and domestic silver prices are still affected by fluctuations in foreign silver markets. If we compare the monthly average exchange rates of British and US dollars with the parity calculated based on London silver prices in the past three years, and calculate the difference between the market price and the parity, we have the following table:</p>
<p>(Note 1) The figures before November 3, 1935, are based on forward prices, and the figures after are based on recent prices.</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the silver export tax, the exchange rate decreased slightly, but soon returned to its rise. By the spring of 1935, it continued to rise to US$0.42 or GB£0.205 per yuan. The highest prices in the first half of October 1934 were US$0.38 and GB£0.185. There are several reasons why the exchange rate continued to rise. China's foreign exchange has long been affected by fluctuations in foreign silver prices, and it is impossible to break this connection in a short period of time. Silver is still silver, and foreign silver prices will inevitably rise along with it, which cannot be suppressed by banning exports. Currency continued to tighten, and the Shanghai wholesale price index was 99.9 in February 1935, but fell to 90.5 in July of the same year. Moreover, foreign silver prices were 15% to 65% higher than domestic silver prices, and the profit from smuggling was very high. Given the vastness of China's borders, coupled with the obstacles of extraterritoriality and concessions, prevention was very difficult. The sign of silver outflow was extreme financial tightness. The impact was enough to raise foreign exchange and lower prices. Although silver interest rates fell slightly after the Lunar New Year settlement in February 1935, this was not evidence of ample funds, but rather due to the exhaustion of funds in the market at that time. The delay in construction and the obstruction of government financial arrangements were profound and significant.</p>
<p>At that time, the signs of economic crisis in China became increasingly evident. Bond prices plummeted, real estate prices fell, and the weaker Chinese and foreign firms went bankrupt one after another. Those who勉强勉强maintained were also greatly weakened, leading to an increasing and spreading of bankruptcies and unemployment. This situation was most severe in the spring and autumn of 1935. During this period, the government, with the cooperation of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, raised relief measures and allocated 25,000,000 yuan in treasury notes to lend to various industries to solve the urgent need, and the danger of national economic bankruptcy was fortunately avoided.</p>
<p>The most important measure taken by the government was to reorganize the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, increase government capital, and enable them to cooperate with the Central Bank in providing relief to industry and commerce and reforming the currency system, thereby achieving twice the result with half the effort. After the government shares in the Bank of China were increased to 15,000,000 yuan, the total capital was 40,000,000 yuan, 50% of which was government shares. After the government shares in the Bank of Communications were increased by 10,000,000 yuan, the total capital was 20,000,000 yuan, 60% of which was government shares.</p>
<p>In early 1935, the government was well aware that thorough currency reform was the only way to stabilize finance. To prevent currency tightening and save China from the whirlpool of economic panic, this was the only option. Therefore, the reform plan was approved. By October, the situation had become even more dangerous, so on November 3, the government resolutely implemented the new currency system policy and promulgated the legal tender measures, stipulating: (1) Stabilizing foreign exchange, approximately based on the foreign exchange market price at that time; (2) The banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender and issued centrally; (3) Silver is nationalized; (4) The Central Bank is reorganized into a Central Reserve Bank to become a detached institution; (5) Improve the commercial banking system and find ways to increase its activity; (6) Consolidate public finances so that the national budget can balance revenue and expenditure again after eighteen months. (The declaration and notice of the implementation of the new currency policy are appended below.)</p>
<p>The day after the new currency system bill was announced, the British Ambassador issued an order requiring all British merchants and residents in China to comply and prohibiting the use of silver to pay debts, with violators being considered criminals.</p>
<p>The government also found that China's old subsidiary coins were extremely complex, so it promulgated the subsidiary coin regulations and ordered the Central Mint to mint subsidiary coins of 20 fen, 10 fen, 5 fen, 1 fen, and 1/2 fen, which were issued on February 10th of this year. In order to facilitate merchants and residents, silver coins of 1/2 yuan and 1 yuan will be minted to complete the types of coins. The number of subsidiary coins minted by the Central Mint in the first half of this year is listed below:</p>
<p>Type Number Face Value</p>
<p>20 Fen Nickel Coins 11,618,544 2,323,708.80 yuan</p>
<p>10 Fen Nickel Coins 18,183,668 1,818,366.80 yuan</p>
<p>5 Fen Nickel Coins 50,737,202 2,536,860.10 yuan</p>
<p>1 Fen Copper Coins 119,980,000 1,199,800.00 yuan (Note)</p>
<p>1/2 Fen Copper Coins 41,160,000 205,800.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total 241,679,411 8,084,535.70 yuan</p>
<p>(Note) Includes 3,100,000 pieces (worth 31,000 yuan) minted in December 1935.</p>
<p>However, various currencies are circulating in China, and they must be gradually withdrawn. The number of new subsidiary coins required will naturally be very large. It may take several years to completely replace the old ones.</p>
<p>The government's measures to reform finance have achieved good results and are now being vigorously promoted to achieve complete success. Since the announcement of the legal tender bill, the Ministry of Finance has established a Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Management Committee in Shanghai, and approved the establishment of branches in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Jinan, Changsha, Qingdao, and other places, responsible for the custody of the legal tender issuance reserve fund, and at the same time responsible for the issuance and exchange of legal tender. Regarding the exchange of legal tender, the Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for the exchange of legal tender and regulations for the management of silver used in silver products, which are progressing smoothly. In order to prevent improper speculation and excessive price increases, price stabilization committees have been established in various places to crack down on them.</p>
<p>The implementation of the new currency system has been initially successful. The Shanghai wholesale price index was 90.5 in July 1935, 94.1 in October, 103.3 in October, and 106.1 in June 1936. The Lunar New Year customs closure was passed safely, and there was no disturbance in the market. Export trade in the first half of this year increased by a quarter compared with the same period last year. Customs revenue initially showed an increase, but began to decrease slightly due to the impact of rampant smuggling in North China.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency system, national capital has become more concentrated. Foreign exchange is extremely stable. As of the end of June of this year, the Issuance Reserve Management Committee has collected 225,000,000 yuan of silver, in addition to the original silver held by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. In November 1935, the Chinese government signed a contract with the US government to sell 50,000,000 ounces of silver at a price of US$0.65 per ounce, which was shipped to the US in December of last year. In May of this year, a second batch of silver was sold to the United States. This measure was taken to regulate foreign exchange and stabilize exchange rates, in order to strengthen people's faith in the new currency system. The United States' support for China's new currency system not only benefits the Chinese people, but also greatly benefits foreigners who trade with us.</p>
<p>In May of this year, in order to increase the security of legal tender, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the cash reserve for legal tender should still consist of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, with the minimum amount of silver reserve accounting for 25% of the total issuance. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance announced the abolition of restrictions on the use of silver in silver products. (The declaration and ministerial order are appended below.) Since the implementation of the new currency system, the total issuance of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications has increased from 427,000,000 yuan to 856,000,000 yuan (calculated on June 27th of this year), an increase of 429,000,000 yuan. Of this amount, 139,000,000 yuan was used to redeem banknotes issued by other banks in the past, and the remaining 290,000,000 yuan was prepared with 172,000,000 yuan of redeemed silver, gold and foreign exchange, and bonds recovered from the market. The total issuance in China as of the end of June of this year is listed below:</p>
<p>Total issuance of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications 856,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Other banks 165,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Farmers Bank 71,912,000 yuan)</p>
<p>(Previous banks that have not been redeemed 93,000,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Total 1,021,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>The central government has spared no effort to consolidate the currency policy of various provinces. For example, after the reorganization of the various currencies originally circulating in Sichuan Province, they were all redeemed with banknotes from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The Southwest is also planning to change to the silver dollar system, unifying the national currency system.</p>
<p>Overall, China has made significant progress in stabilizing finance in the past year. With a solid foundation, if there is no obstruction from changes in the international situation, the national economy can be expected to prosper day by day.</p>
<p>Budget</p>
<p>The year 1935 has just ended, and the final accounts will take some time. Here, we will briefly list the general situation of revenue and expenditure for the five years since 1930, based on the report of the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance, for comparison (Note 1):</p>
<p>The amount of the deficit in 1934 was 196,000,000 yuan. Of this amount, 73,500,000 yuan was allocated to government shares in banks to relieve the financial panic in that year. Therefore, the actual fiscal deficit was 122,500,000 yuan (Note 2).</p>
<p>Note 1: The figures listed in this table are slightly different from those listed in previous financial reports of the Ministry of Finance, because the Accounting Department has now changed its calculation method in accordance with the methods of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, using the collection fees of various taxes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance as appropriations for the expenditures of the Ministry of Finance, instead of deducting them from the tax revenue.</p>
<p>Note 2: Calculation of the net deficit</p>
<p>Total expenditure 940,928,456.11</p>
<p>Total revenue 744,922,042.20</p>
<p>Total deficit 196,006,413.91</p>
<p>Total investment 73,500,000.00</p>
<p>Net deficit 122,506,413.91</p>
<p>Most of the deficits in the above years can be offset by expenditures on debt repayment. The expenditures on debt repayment and the fiscal deficits for each year are listed in the table below (in millions of yuan):</p>
<p>Fiscal Year Debt Repayment Amount Deficit Amount</p>
<p>1930 150 217</p>
<p>1931 160 130</p>
<p>1932 100 86</p>
<p>1933 115 147</p>
<p>1934 125 196</p>
<p>Total 650 776</p>
<p>The annual repayment of the Boxer Indemnity, except for the expenses of secured debts, is generally not included in the above table. Most of the government's borrowing over the years has been used to repay old debts. However, the new bonds issued were issued at a discount, resulting in extremely high interest rates in practice, and the national tax revenues designated as security for the new debts have also been increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit in 1935 was much larger than in the previous year. There are several reasons for the increase: (1) The large-scale smuggling in North China in the past year, the frequent international disputes, and the weakening of people's purchasing power have all reduced the amount of imports, resulting in a sharp decline in customs revenue; (2) Severe floods in rivers, serious disasters, repair dams and relief, and increased expenditures; (3) The economic downturn is becoming more and more profound, and the cost of rescuing the silver industry and the industrial and commercial sectors is also huge; (4) The cost of subsidizing various provinces and local governments is still huge; (5) The suppression of communist bandits in the Northwest and Southwest cannot be delayed; National defense construction is a matter of survival and cannot but be done to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>Military expenditures and debt expenditures have been the main items of annual expenditures, as can be seen in the table on the left:</p>
<p>Note 4: A portion of this amount was paid in the previous year, including 49,000,000 yuan spent in 1931, 59,000,000 yuan spent in 1932, 46,000,000 yuan spent in 1933, and 58,000,000 yuan spent in 1934.</p>
<p>Education and construction expenditures Although the national treasury's financial resources have been depleted in recent years due to coping with various unexpected events and other uses, the Ministry of Finance's concern for the progress of education and construction has not diminished. The Ministry of Finance firmly believes that in order to increase tax revenue, it is necessary to first improve the people's productivity and improve their daily lives. Fortunately, through the Ministry of Finance's efforts, expenditures on education and construction in recent years, including highways, railways, water conservancy, public health, and rural relief, have increased, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>The figures listed in the table above include disaster relief expenses. The subsidies paid to the provinces are not included. Most of the subsidies to the provinces are used to support the development of local education, the implementation of economic construction, and the abolition of exorbitant taxes. The amount is also quite considerable, with 32,001,332.81 yuan in 1933 and 55,488,072.42 yuan in 1934, and the education and construction expenditures for these two items increased even more in 1935.</p>
<p>The national budget for 1936 has been promulgated. The budgeted amounts for revenue and expenditure for 1935 and 1936 are listed separately below for comparison:</p>
<p>In the past seven or eight years, the government has spared no effort to develop and nurture tax sources, such as the revision of customs tariffs, the consolidation and improvement of salt administration, and the creation of a unified tax system, all of which have been effective. The progress of various tax revenues can be seen in the table below:</p>
<p>Although a portion of the increase in tax revenue over the years is due to the gradual direct collection of national taxes in various places by the Ministry of Finance, the required collection expenses have also increased accordingly. Moreover, since 1929, internal rebellions have occurred frequently, and the communist disaster has spread, resulting in huge costs for suppression. In addition, continuous disasters and flood control and relief require money everywhere. The cost of the Yangtze River flood relief in 1931 exceeded 70,000,000 yuan, and the estimated property loss was 200,000,000 yuan, which greatly affected national tax revenue. Since the loss of the Northeast, tax revenue has been lost accordingly, resulting in the failure to allocate funds for the joint agreement for foreign debts secured by customs and salt from these four provinces. Moreover, commerce between the Northeast and the inland provinces has been relatively smooth, but it has been hindered by this, causing great damage to the government's tax revenue and industry and commerce. In the past two or three years, due to the impact of various economic downturns, not only has tax revenue failed to increase, but temporary expenditures on relief and other costs have increased sharply.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Since 1933, the financial hardships our country has faced are unprecedented in modern history. This is due to frequent natural disasters, rampant communist banditry, and the need for substantial funds for disaster relief and bandit suppression. Coupled with the impact of the global economic recession, our country has suffered even more. Furthermore, accumulated debts from previous years have made the financial situation even more difficult than before. However, even amidst such immense difficulties, the Ministry of Finance has still been able to allocate additional funds to promote construction, most notably in areas such as education, highways, railways, water conservancy, public health, rural relief, and other productive enterprises. In addition, efforts have been made to consolidate old debts to maintain the credibility of national bonds. Fortunately, the government adopted the most appropriate measures regarding the national financial organization, responding calmly to changes, and with the united assistance of the people, was able to avoid collapse and move towards stability. Moreover, the financial industry is now gradually showing signs of vigorous growth. Once it fully recovers, its future will be unlimited.</p>
<p>The government's financial reforms and economic construction have now been decisively implemented. If there are no external troubles, more significant progress can be made. Furthermore, the Southwest problem has recently been completely resolved, so there is no further issue of financial unification.</p>
<p>To achieve further progress, the government must base its financial policy on the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) All unnecessary or unproductive expenditures should be curtailed to provide funds for productive and construction purposes.</p>
<p>(2) Identify and train tax collection personnel to improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) Consolidate existing taxes and levy sound new taxes to increase revenue without increasing the burden on the people.</p>
<p>(4) Reform local taxes to align them with national taxes.</p>
<p>(5) Improve the banking system and promote rural credit systems to facilitate the recovery of the rural economy.</p>
<p>(6) Complete the unification of the currency system and maintain the stability of the national currency exchange rate to stabilize the financial situation.</p>
<p>(7) Settle old debts to maintain the credibility of national bonds.</p>
<p>In recent years, the government was forced by circumstances to focus all its efforts on meeting urgent needs. However, in the future, it will shift its focus towards economic construction. To achieve this goal, a more effective budgeting system must be established to control various uses of funds. However, the government's aspiration in finance is not merely to balance revenue and expenditure, but also to make finance healthier day by day, leaving surplus resources to develop domestic economic resources and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>The financial situation for the fiscal year of 1934 and thereafter is presented as follows. Respectfully submitted to:</p>
<p>The Central Political Committee and the public. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance. August 1, 1936.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Chonglou)</p>
<p>If we think about the most real and yet most empty thing in the world, it is the soul.</p>
<p>The soul cannot be touched by hand, nor can it be seen with the eye, yet it is so solid, lurking within each person's body.</p>
<p>If a person loses their soul, undoubtedly, they become a walking corpse, feeling no pain when inflicted! Feeling no anger when insulted! Then the meaning of life is lost.</p>
<p>Like appearances, souls have distinctions of beauty and ugliness, and also of good and evil; beautiful and good souls are like happy seeds, often bringing happiness to the world. Ugly and evil souls are like deliberately planted seeds of disaster, often bringing destruction to the world. It is a pity that in the present day, beautiful and good souls are too few!</p>
<p>Because the soul is one's own, one can dispose of it at will. Some people, disregarding the fact that the soul is their only and unique possession, heartlessly sell it! This behavior is most unfortunate—most pitiable.</p>
<p>Today, we must not lose our souls, becoming insensible walking corpses. Nor can we sell our souls, committing that pitiable act. We should resist ugly souls and cultivate our beautiful and good souls.</p>
<h3>The Eight-Character Bridge in Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, the Eight-Character Bridge in Zhabei, apart from the residents living nearby, probably even rickshaw pullers familiar with the routes couldn't find it. It was truly remote and desolate here, with no bustling shops, no well-to-do residents. Who would pay attention to it? When the January 28th war broke out, the 19th Route Army deployed along the west of the bridge, and the Japanese army attacked from the east of the bridge. The intensity of the fighting was no less than in Jiangwan and the railway station, with repeated losses and gains. For this small piece of land, countless lives were sacrificed. Therefore, the three words "Eight-Character Bridge" were widely reported in newspapers and circulated among the public. So, it is true to say, "The name of the Eight-Character Bridge was bought with fresh, red blood."</p>
<p>Why did the two armies fight so desperately for this small Eight-Character Bridge? Because in terms of terrain, it was indeed the throat of Zhabei along the east. Because there is a very long Sha Jing Port in Zhabei, starting from Jiangwan in the north and ending at the Huangpu River in the east. Within the Zhabei area, the two armies faced each other across this river. The southern end of the Eight-Character Bridge is Yokohama Road, and the Japanese army's attack began along this road. If this bridge were crossed, then the communication line between the North Railway Station and Jiangwan would be cut off immediately, and the bustling area of Zhabei would immediately be liable to be occupied. Therefore, the attacking side paid attention to this, and the defending side did not dare to slacken, thus creating repeated fierce and terrifying offensive and defensive battles.</p>
<p>However, if you look at the end of this bridge daily, you would hardly believe that war had happened near this bridge, and that it was so fierce. The bridge surface, about ten feet wide and twenty feet long, lies flatly on the dirty Sha Jing Port. The river water is as black as ink; in the middle, there is an awful stench; sometimes a few awning boats are parked in the river. At the east end of the bridge is Shuidaidian Road, and at the intersection stands a hundred-year-old ginkgo tree, showing its majestic angularity. At the west end, there are a few small houses, opening a few small shops, that end leads directly to Liuying Road. The north and south are Yokohama Road, which is also unusually deserted. Most of the tall Western-style houses were destroyed by artillery fire and have not been restored; private villas and gardens are also desolate and dilapidated. In this point, it can be proved that the name of the Eight-Character Bridge is truly not accidental.</p>
<h3>Miss Killer</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Miss Killer, the one mentioned here is not Miss Tao, who is still in Hangzhou prison, but another lady who kills without using weapons.</p>
<p>The Miss Killer mentioned in this article is a relative by marriage. She was betrothed in childhood, and when she was eight years old, her parents died, so she lived in her fiancé's family. Childhood sweethearts, innocent and carefree, her feelings with her fiancé were better than brother and sister. Later, her fiancé's family sent her to school, from elementary school to middle school, and she actually became a high-achieving student in a certain middle school. Her fiancé fully intended to marry her after she graduated from middle school, but one month before her graduation ceremony, she suddenly hired a lawyer and asked her fiancé to cancel the marriage contract that her parents had arranged for her when she was a minor. Her fiancé was suffering from some minor illnesses at the time. After receiving this blow, his illness worsened, and he died before the lawsuit was over.</p>
<p>After her fiancé's death, her termination of the marriage contract was easily resolved. Then she formally married her lover. Her husband was already married, but for her sake, he forced his legal wife to divorce. His legal wife was a woman who couldn't think things through. After the divorce, the more she thought about it, the narrower her perspective became, so she secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. But she and her husband lived happily together for only a year, and she discovered many shortcomings in her husband. The most unbearable thing for her was his fondness for prostitution, so she resolutely demanded a divorce. After more than three months of litigation, the divorce was successful, but her husband received this stimulus too deeply. He felt too sorry for his ex-wife, and his mind became perverted from thinking about it day and night. Finally, one night, he jumped down from the roof of a five-story building and ended his life.</p>
<p>It was on the very night that her ex-husband committed suicide that she was holding a wedding with a banker in a large hotel. This banker, who had married such a beautiful socialite, was overjoyed. In terms of money, not only was every request granted, but sometimes, even without a request, he would find ways to provide for her. After entering the social scene, she had never met such a straightforward man, so she was extremely fortunate to have married such a good husband. However, her good husband was originally strong on the outside but weak on the inside. After living together for a year, he had already accumulated a lot of deficits. In order to make up for them, he secretly embezzled public funds to engage in speculative transactions. Unexpectedly, every battle was lost, and the deficits could not be made up, so he hardened his heart and committed suicide in a hotel.</p>
<p>In the hands of this Miss Killer, four people have been killed in just three years. Currently, she is looking for her next partner. But I don't know, in this world, which unfortunate person will become her fifth victim? I am sweating for her future husband.</p>

<h3>Swapping the Nest for the Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Drinking Water to Swear Heartfelt Words, Lamps Illuminate Withered Faces, Crooking Fingers in Agreement, Red Beans Report Yearning</p>
<p>Li Youmei's probing this time was not entirely in vain. He had already seen many traces in Zhang Guoqi's house. When he returned home and said that Miss Jiang had already come once to make a decision, he smiled and nodded twice. It was already afternoon that day, so he couldn't go out. The next morning, he changed into a then extremely fashionable blue mandarin duck patterned short jacket, a white ground with red plum blossom dotted gauze skirt, and combed his hair sleekly, and came to Jiang's house. Menglan was just because school was suspended for three days to hold term exams, so she was spreading books on the table under the upstairs window to read. Youmei stood at the doorway, poking her head inside, then stood outside the door, tapping on the door frame, and said with a smile: May I come in, Menglan looked up and saw her, and got up to greet her, saying with a smile: Why are you so polite today, Youmei said with a smile, I have my reasons. When I was outside, I saw you writing at the table, and I thought, perhaps I shouldn't intrude rashly, Menglan took his hand and let him sit on the chair next to the desk, and said with a smile: What you said is a little incomprehensible to me. Could it be that the homework I am doing is afraid that you will copy it, Youmei said with a smile: I am not referring to the homework. As she spoke, she smiled at Menglan. Menglan, however, sat very generously on the rattan chair, not paying much attention to his words. Instead, she looked over his flowery clothes all over his body. Youmei said with a smile: Fortunately, you are not a man. If you were a man, I would really be embarrassed. Every time I come, you always look at me up and down, enough. Menglan said with a smile: That doesn't mean I blame you for looking at you. Your body up and down, flowery dots, is just like a living Guanyin. Youmei looked down at the clothes on her body, and said with a smile: Do you think the pattern is a little fashionable? But I have my own ideas. When we are so young, we can wear flowery clothes. When we get old in the future, seeing others wearing flowery clothes, we regret it, then it's too late. Menglan shook her head and said: My thoughts are different from yours. I don't want to dress too fashionably now, I will never regret not being fashionable in my life. Youmei had already drafted several drafts of the conversation in her heart, so she said with a smile: Naturally, people's preferences are not only related to each person's temperament, but also to each person's life experience. Two years ago, you were an innocent and clever little girl, you also loved the lively, you also loved the fashionable. (92)</p>

<h3>My Mother's Death</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>A mother's love is great, it is unconditional, not built on material things, but unlucky me, suddenly lost this love recently, what a painful thing that is!</p>
<p>My mother gave birth to my two brothers. My father passed away when I was only four years old, and my younger brother was only two years old. Our family was poor, without any savings. My mother worked hard with her own hands, enduring hardship to raise us. Later, I went to live with my maternal grandparents, and my mother also came to depend on them. Since the death of my maternal grandparents, my mother lived separately with my younger brother, but still came to visit and care for us from time to time. For twenty or thirty years, she has been like this. My mother's kindness is so great, it is truly limitless.</p>
<p>In recent years, my brother and I lived in Ximen, and I rented a house in Dananmen, not far away. Every few days, I would definitely go to visit her. Although I am at the age of ambition, my mother still sees me as a child. When she sees me arrive, she always takes out candy and pastries from the jar to treat me. When the weather is cold and snowy, seeing me wearing a Western suit, she always says it is so thin, isn't it too cold? It's better to wear a camel hair robe, it's warmer. Although I am working during the day, my salary is not high, so I have to bury myself under the lamp at night, writing articles to earn money, to supplement my income. When my mother found out, she often advised me: "Don't use your brain power too much, rest earlier at night, exhaustion can cause illness, you must pay attention!" My situation is frustrating, and I often have negative thoughts. My mother used gentle persuasion to ease my worries. If my thoughts did not change, my mother was so anxious that she cried and said: "My son, please don't be like this, later when mother is old, I still need to rely on you to live. "At this time, tears involuntarily flowed from my eyes. My mother also shed tears in return. This scene is still vivid in my memory, but from now on, no one will care for me, no one will be considerate of me. Because this mother who cared for me and was considerate of me has left me and passed away.</p>
<p>My mother was usually very healthy. She got up early to help my brother's wife and the servants with housework, never shying away from fatigue. But since last year, she suddenly suffered from stomach trouble, sometimes it would get better, sometimes it would get worse, her body suffered greatly. In addition, last winter, my nephew Jia Rong, out of patriotism, committed suicide in anger. Jia Rong was my mother's most beloved eldest grandson, and my mother felt extremely sorry. From then on, she was depressed, until this autumn when she suffered from dysentery and also suffered from external symptoms. She repeatedly sought treatment from famous Chinese and Western doctors, who all said that dysentery was still treatable, but this external symptom called "cancer" was very tricky. But later the wound gradually became smaller, and we were all overjoyed, thinking that my mother had escaped death and there was hope for recovery. We were just preparing to wait for my mother's body to recover, and have a good family celebration, but who knew that this family celebration became a dream, that death god stretched out his giant spirit hand and grabbed my mother away!</p>
<p>After my mother got sick, every time the setting sun was dim, I would return from Gordon Road School, and I would first go to Songxue Street in Ximen to comfort her in front of her bed, or hold my mother's hand to see if she had a fever or chills. But I always believed that medicine was omnipotent, especially the technology of Western medicine, who knew that medicine in the current era is still pitifully young. I am pained by my mother's death, and can't help but curse those so-called famous doctors.</p>
<p>That day, I was late because of something at school, it was already after six o'clock in the evening. Unexpectedly, as soon as I stepped into the door, my mother was already dying. As soon as my mother saw me arrive, she immediately waved her hand and passed away. It turned out that around four o'clock, my mother had been moaning and nearly dying. But in a hurry, the family couldn't find my telephone number, so they had to say to my mother: "Don't go! Ji Yun hasn't returned yet. "Ji Yun is my alias, my mother often called me Ji Yun. After being mentioned this, my mother seemed to have taken a stimulant, opened her eyes wide, and looked out the door, looking straight until I stepped into the room, made this last farewell, and then closed her eyes and passed away. This tragic impression is truly deeply imprinted in my mind, and will not be diminished in this life. From now on, no matter in any time of fragrant flowers and singing birds, any scenic area, any scene of bright lights and fine wine, any moment of joy, as long as I suddenly think of this tragic impression, I will suddenly be stunned and teary. Gui Zhenchuan's biography of his deceased mother said: "There are people who have no every year, Heaven, how painful!" I truly embrace the same feeling.</p>

<h3>Fleeing and Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>— (Yiyi Pavilion Master)</p>
<p>"Fleeing"! "Fleeing"! You must know that during this time of urgent national crisis, there is a possibility of "fleeing" everywhere. If you don't work hard to eliminate the national crisis, there will eventually be a day when you can't escape this "disaster"!</p>
<p>A friend of mine fled from Jiangwan to the concession. Because it was relatively convenient to enter and exit, he went to dance halls or movie theaters every night. I smiled at him and said, "Fleeing is not about entertainment." He listened and said solemnly, "Entertainment doesn't forget saving the nation"!</p>
<h3>A Pinch of Soil</h3>
<p>— Dai Zhongxin</p>
<p>Emperor Taizong lowered his head, picked up a pinch of soil with his imperial finger, and flicked it into the wine. Sanzang did not understand his intention. Emperor Taizong smiled and said, "Imperial brother! This time, you go to the Western Paradise, when can you return?" Sanzang said, "Only in three years, I will return directly to the upper kingdom." Emperor Taizong said, "It's been a long time, the mountains are far away, Imperial Brother, you can drink this wine; I would rather love a pinch of soil from my homeland than love ten thousand taels of gold from a foreign land." This is a story from the thirteenth year of the Zhenguan era of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>Now is not the prosperous Tang Dynasty. Four hundred million Taizongs picked up a pinch of soil, put it in wine, and said while drinking, "When can this matter be over? Never mind, let's drink this wine; I swear to protect a pinch of soil from my motherland, not afraid of others' ten thousand guns!"</p>
<h3>Keep it in Mind</h3>
<p>— Maode</p>
<p>Our common disease is seen through to the extreme by neighboring countries. The other day, on my way home from vacation, when I passed Ximen, I caught a glimpse of a policeman interfering with a rickshaw puller. Suddenly, a young man wearing a Zhongshan suit stepped in to stop him. He took out a badge and said to the policeman, "I am an employee of the ×× Bureau. It's okay, can you not listen to me?"</p>
<p>"Using personal connections to override the law, our love of face can be seen." On the way back, I thought so.</p>
<h3>The Gold and Silver Cave of Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianci</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Guangxi must admire the Gold and Silver Cave.</p>
<p>The Gold and Silver Cave is located south of the city of Si'en Prefecture. There, two peaks stand facing each other, with a high cliff. On the cliff are inscribed the eleven large characters: "Gold seven li, silver seven li, only in seventy-seven li." The characters are written with extraordinary strength, and it is unknown when they were carved. Below the cliff is a land temple, built by the local people. There was a geomancer who said that there was gold and silver energy in the land, so the local people searched in many ways, but the result was still nothing. Later, it was known that there was another cave on the side peak, in which the accumulated silver was seen. So the local people built wooden frames to climb up, went inside to pick it up, but could not carry it out, or picked it up and threw it out, and it disappeared as soon as it hit the ground. Someone once led a dog in, wanting to tie the silver to the dog's body and lead it out, but when leading it, the dog had to bark, and when it came out, the silver on the dog's body was also gone, so the local people all said that there was a spirit in the cave, and later they all warned each other not to enter. It is said that it is still like this today.</p>

<h3>Research on Married Life: Sexual Neurasthenia - Medical Remedies to Satisfy Wives</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Junshi, Medical Doctor from Germany</p>
<p>…This disease can affect marital happiness, cause wives to become upset, and lead to the breakdown of love… the bad habit of masturbation is an important cause of this disease, so young unmarried people should quickly quit… local treatment is inappropriate because the affected area of this disease is the entire central nervous system</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that sexual neurasthenia affects marital happiness. There is no need for me to elaborate in detail, but the purpose of this article is to present an effective method to clear the gloom between husband and wife, so that the love of husband and wife will last forever and be happy for life. Before I can explain the method for good health, I will first give a concrete account of the causes of this disease.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for promoting this disease. However, the most frightening of these is the matter of excessive masturbation by young people in their unmarried years. Because the method of masturbation is very simple, and very free, it can be done anytime, anywhere, relying only on the stimulation of the five senses such as the eyes and ears, or simply by imagination, it is very easy to arouse sexual excitement, so it is easy to commit excessive masturbation, especially during masturbation, whether physically or mentally, excessive energy is consumed, so impotence, premature ejaculation, and small genitals induced by excessive masturbation are particularly numerous.</p>
<p>Sexual function occupies an important place in married life. It can ingeniously connect and maintain the love between two sexes. If a man's sexual function is healthy, his wife's mental state is very pleasant. But why do some husbands lose this function and make their wives upset? From a medical point of view, this is entirely due to the unsoundness of the puberty glands (i.e., reproductive glands). Therefore, it is necessary to take the genuine reproductive gland element preparation "Germen", which has a significant effect. This drug was made by Austrian physiology master Stanna from the essence of the reproductive gland element extracted from strong animals. Before it was successful, dozens of animal experiments were done. After surgical supplementation of the endocrine of the reproductive glands to soft animals such as mice, the genitals of these mice became very strong; the spirit was also unexpectedly sufficient. Stanna spent more than thirty years to achieve this unparalleled specific medicine for sexual neurasthenia. The reason is that the affected area of this disease is the entire central nervous system, and the sexual organs themselves are only terminal nerves. It is not impossible to say that there are no obstacles in the part at all. Therefore, local treatment is not appropriate for this disease, so this preparation must be used for fundamental treatment.</p>
<p>The situation of Austrian Stanna, the inventor of "Germen", using this preparation for mice experiments proves that the success of the drug is completely in line with science.</p>

<h3>Must Take the Rational Path to Radically Cure Bone Pain in the Weak</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>…There are four main reasons that can trigger this disease… with proper treatment, it will not occur even in old age</p>
<p>To avoid the attack of this disease, you must try to remove all the causes that cause bone pain. The important factors that promote bone pain are climate, overwork, indulgence in lust, and unrestrained smoking and drinking. These four are the important causes of the outbreak of this disease.</p>
<p>Climate obviously has a close relationship with this disease. For example, being cold in cold weather, or getting drenched in rainwater when it rains, and sleeping in the cold, etc. All can make wind-dampness accumulate internally, resulting in the outbreak of this disease.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is also obvious that overwork can cause joint pain. People who work too hard often feel soreness in their waist and back. In addition, indulgence in lust and being infected with blood toxins can lead to premature aging of the puberty glands and weaken the body's resistance. Therefore, before reaching old age, they feel the pain of bone pain all over the body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, smoking and drinking can stimulate the stomach and intestines. If you drink too much, you will immediately feel tired. At the same time, it can increase the accumulation of wind-dampness and blood toxins. Therefore, if drinking becomes a habit, it is the only sufferer of this disease.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, when the waist and back are sore. One side should take the reproductive gland element preparation "Germen" to increase resistance. At the same time, it must be treated with "Strong Stanna Bone Pain Tablets", which have several abilities to dispel wind, remove dampness, clear blood toxins, and prevent arteriosclerosis. Not only can it quickly restore those who are already ill. It can also enhance the physical strength of those who are not ill. The spirit is sufficient. Even when you are old and decrepit, you can guarantee that there will be no bone pain attacks. You can enjoy a lifetime of health.</p>
<h3>The Choice of Smoking Cessation Methods - A Reasonable and Effective Method for Weak Smokers</h3>
<p>— Doctor Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>First, let me describe the reasons why people become addicted, and then talk about the safe smoking cessation method for the weak, so that readers can understand it particularly well.</p>
<p>The reason for opium addiction is entirely because once the toxins enter the human body, they easily anesthetize the body's cells. Therefore, long-term smoking can lead to addiction. On the one hand, after the cells are poisoned, they become sluggish and must rely on the stimulation of tobacco to carry out metabolic functions. Therefore, if smokers reduce the amount of tobacco, they will feel weak. If they quit completely, all the cells in the body will fall into a dying state. This can affect the overall health, and all kinds of problems will follow, such as mental fatigue, weak limbs, dizziness, restlessness, insomnia, night sweats, palpitations, and forgetfulness. This makes the smoker's inherent weak resistance insufficient to eliminate this kind of pain. Those with weak constitutions are even more embarrassed, and there is even a risk of death. Therefore, many arrested smokers die.</p>
<p>There is no need for the author to waste words describing the difficulty of quitting smoking for weak smokers. This is almost universally known. According to medical theory, weakness is entirely caused by tobacco toxins invading the reproductive glands, the source of life, leading to atrophy of the reproductive glands, resulting in the loss of their inherent metabolic capacity. Therefore, most addicts suffer from impotence and premature ejaculation, and must smoke before they can have sexual intercourse. Therefore, weak smokers who want to quit smoking safely must use "Reproductive Prime," a reproductive gland hormone preparation for nourishing and supplementing smoking cessation, because it has a powerful nourishing force that is sufficient to eliminate tobacco toxins. Therefore, the smoker can unconsciously become disgusted with tobacco, guaranteeing no pain.</p>

<h3>A New Contribution to the Treatment of Masturbation and Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Doctor Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>...Sweep away all the outdated and slow old medicines to satisfy the patient's ideals... Establish a novel and simple effective treatment method to shine brightly in the modern medical field</p>
<p>Seminal emission is a common disease among young people. Healthy people, after ten days or half a month, when sperm is full, it overflows, which is not harmful. If the frequency is slightly higher, and too much sperm is lost, both the body and nerves will feel weak. Severe patients may even have seminal emission during daytime naps, when reading obscene books and newspapers, or when seeing women. Since the patient's spermatic duct is so relaxed, they have no control over ejaculation. After marriage, premature ejaculation will inevitably occur, hindering lifelong happiness.</p>
<p>For health and happiness, many young people are crying out for treatment from doctors like starving children. However, what help can doctors offer these poor patients? Suitable treatments have always been lacking. Doctors can only do their best to use many irrelevant or difficult-to-implement methods to make their patients try them randomly.</p>
<p>They say to the patients: You must sleep soundly, and you must avoid being prone to dreams and waking up easily. But how to get a sound sleep? The doctors are helpless, and many people can still have seminal emission even during deep sleep. Patients really do not get any benefit from this kind of treatment. In addition, there are some ways to reduce friction on the glans; stimulate the glans to prevent it from becoming too sensitive; and use comfort and persuasion methods to prevent the fear of seminal emission and calm the nerves. These are all perfunctory methods. As for the life-saving injections, their effect is only to make people have abundant sperm and strength. They have no effect on the control of the spermatic duct. Using them to treat seminal emission is like the unrelated analogy of a horse's head and a cow's mouth.</p>
<p>The latest medical research has long denied the effectiveness of the above methods, and unanimously praised the new treatment method of German Dr. Himi Tuo. Originally, a good treatment method has three advantages: first, the effect is definitely harmless; second, it is simple and easy to implement without pain; and third, it is effective quickly. Dr. Himi Tuo's method happens to include these advantages and has no shortcomings.</p>
<p>He uses the purest medicinal materials and the most careful preparation methods to make "Himi Tuo's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets," which have a definite sperm-strengthening effect and have the above advantages. When invented, the doctor spent a full 25 years in the laboratory researching it, and believed that it was indeed effective before it became popular around the world, curing more than a million people. Medical treatment examples and research reports from the global medical community, scattered in European and American medical journals, all praised this medicine. However, after seminal emission is cured, health that has been lost in the past should be supplemented by taking "Reproductive Prime" to compensate for its deficiency. "Reproductive Prime" was invented by Dr. Stanah and complements "Himi Tuo's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets." They are a perfect match. Taking the two medicines together has a real and corresponding benefit of achieving twice the result with half the effort. I have used these two medicines in clinical practice to cure countless people.</p>

<p>Patient: Gu Hongzhi, 26 years old, from Kaifeng, Henan. Chief complaint: weak physique, impotence, premature ejaculation, premature aging, and other symptoms. Medical history: weak physique in childhood, congenital deficiency, so the trunk is short, physical strength is weak. Married at the age of 21, after marriage, excessive sexual activity gradually became unsustainable, leading to impotence and premature ejaculation. The body became thinner and thinner, the face became old, the skin was dry, like a person in his forties, and he also had dizziness, confusion, decreased vision, forgetfulness, insomnia, and often felt depressed, so he came for treatment. Treatment method: The root cause of Gu Jun's disease lies in the waste of resources. With a weak body and limited energy, he indulged in endless desires, which led to his exhaustion. The treatment method is to replenish his original energy and make the deficient body return to fullness, so that he can sweep away the old age and restore the vitality of youth. Therefore, he was immediately given a large amount of reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Prime" and injected with "Yuwei Cibaoming." After a month, it had a significant effect. He felt quite healthy. After three months, his sexual function returned to its original state, his whole body was strong, his face was rosy, his brainpower was improved, and all symptoms were cured. His spirit was especially abundant, and he had returned to being a handsome young man.</p>
<p>(2) Seminal Emission Often Starts with Masturbation</p>
<p>Patient: Han Ziping, 21 years old, from Tianjin, Hebei. Chief complaint: He masturbated very frequently during development, resulting in seminal emission, frequent times, academic decline, and worry about marital happiness in the future. Medical history: He knew about masturbation since he was eleven or twelve years old. During development, his sexual desire was strong, and he was seduced by the discussions of bad friends and obscene books, so he enjoyed it even more. He reduced it slightly when he was seventeen or eighteen years old, and then had seminal emission. Recently, the frequency has become more frequent, sometimes with dreams, sometimes without dreams, dizziness, inability to concentrate, and a great decline in grades. His parents have scheduled him to get married next spring. Han Jun is worried about his worsening hidden illness, fearing that it will affect his happiness in the future, and is very depressed. Treatment method: First, use "Himi Tuo's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to strengthen his spermatic duct and stop his seminal emission, so as not to lose the precious source of life. Then, use the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Prime" prepared by Dr. Stanah to restore his reproductive glands to health and promote endocrine function. After two months, the seminal emission has stopped and the body is also strong. He can work hard at his studies and wait to be a happy groom. ("Himi Tuo's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" and "Reproductive Prime" are both packed in iron boxes. Those packed in paper boxes or bottles are counterfeit and should not be purchased by mistake, causing harm to life. "Reproductive Prime" is divided into male and female types. Purchasers must recognize the gender and should not use it indiscriminately.)</p>
<h3>Unpleasant Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>Sir: I am forty years old this year and have been troubled by leukorrhea for five years. I have given birth many times, and my body is weak. The leukorrhea is even worse, and I am very distressed. I wonder if there is a simple and effective self-treatment method?</p>

<h3>Good Medicine for Stomach Problems</h3>
<p>Editor: My child is only sixteen or seventeen years old. Because he likes to eat snacks, his stomach is injured. Recently, his appetite has been greatly reduced and his stomach hurts. I have consulted a Chinese medicine practitioner for several prescriptions, but they have not been cured. I am afraid that it will become a chronic disease. Please advise on a miraculous medicine.</p>
<p>"Stomach Pain Relief" should be taken for stomach pain, which will heal it naturally. After the pain stops, take "Stomach Invigorator," and the appetite will be improved.</p>

<p>Common Knowledge About Bone Pain</p>
<h3>Insights on Treating Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Doctor Yu Bofu</p>
<p>—Must prescribe the right medicine to cure it forever—</p>
<p>A popular disease that is widespread, and there is still no absolutely effective treatment method. Patients feel painful and unable to escape, and doctors also sigh helplessly because they are helpless. In this time of ineffective medicine, the medical community cannot help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Bone pain is such a disease. Due to overwork, unbridled debauchery, syphilis sequelae, internal cold, and the production of a large amount of uric acid in the blood, after the oxygen crystallizes, it penetrates into the bone marrow, causing pain. Too much oxygen in the blood vessels can also cause diseases such as arteriosclerosis and stroke. Almost 70-80% of middle-aged men and women have this common disease.</p>
<p>How to eliminate this disease? The medical community has been wandering for a long time for this problem. In the past, it could only use anesthetic drugs to relieve pain during major attacks, and there was simply no way to think about the disease itself.</p>
<p>Now, "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" invented by American Dr. Johnston can be used to treat it, which is incredibly effective. Even if the disease has progressed to hemiplegia, it can be cured in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Patient Wu Minghui, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, is 51 years old. He was weak and felt back pain in his early years. Because he ignored treatment, it deteriorated and turned into hemiplegia. He took more than a dozen kinds of medicine without any effect. Later, I used "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat him. After taking only four boxes, he immediately felt his joints relaxed, his movements were flexible, and the pain was completely relieved.</p>
<h3>Female Beauty and Fertility - The Road to Beauty and Successful Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>If a woman cannot achieve satisfactory development when she matures, her breasts will definitely be shriveled and unable to stand tall, and at the same time, the curves of her buttocks cannot be revealed. Such people are of course not beautiful. They are as miserable and troubled as women who cannot bear children. However, the reasons for infertility are not as brief as the above. There are really several types, especially the most important ones are irregular menstruation, uterine disorders, leukorrhea, and gonorrhea. In addition, genital deformities can also cause infertility. Those with weak constitutions are prone to miscarriage, or even if they give birth, they cannot grow up. Therefore, they are also included in the examples of infertility.</p>
<p>If you want to remedy the above shortcomings, the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Prime" can improve development. After taking it, the breasts can suddenly stand tall and the buttocks are also unusually plump. At the same time, menstruation is adjusted and uterine disorders are eliminated. Therefore, if there is no gonorrhea or leukorrhea, you only need to take "Reproductive Prime" to guarantee a quick pregnancy, and beauty can be expected, and the children born will definitely not be congenitally deficient and die prematurely. However, if you suffer from gonorrhea, you must take "Anti-Gonorrhea," a combination preparation of Flavochrome and Phagycine. Other combination preparations are not suitable, because in addition to Flavochrome and Phagycine, the rest of the combination preparations are harmful to the stomach and intestines and have great side effects, so the victims are not a few. In addition, leukorrhea should be stopped with "Cure Leukorrhea." The above method has been proven by countless doctors' experiments to be a reasonable and important way to seek fertility and beauty.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Arson</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bund has nine schools of thought and three classes of people, with all kinds of news happening that is beyond the ordinary. Making a living by arson is just one of many.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, people are "compassionate" and "merciful" animals. They think about everything in a good way, and there is no reason to cut off their own chances of survival. The so-called "life after death" is nothing more than the meaning of "burning the boat," and it is definitely not destroying yourself first and then talking. However, this is just a dead principle, and people as smart as humans will "live" and use it. We know that the origin of the insurance business is because people want safety. Fire insurance is to prevent fires, hoping to pay a small amount of insurance premiums; you can save yourself from constantly worrying and holding the mentality that if it burns, you have insurance, so you are willing to eat a little immediate loss. Originally, this is a shortcoming of people, but the fire insurance business survives on this shortcoming. However, "there is always someone better," although the fire insurance business uses the psychological shortcoming of human complacency, some people instead use the shortcoming of this shortcoming to give it a hard time. Therefore, from this point of view, making a living by arson is nothing strange.</p>
<p>The local news in this city recently reported: Cracking down on the arson machine. It roughly said: A Russian in Shanghai secretly manufactured arson machines specifically to set fires for others, seeking compensation from insurance companies. It has recently been cracked, and one person was arrested with the case, followed by three more people. The evening newspaper continued to report that, according to the confession of the seven arrested criminals, one person first entrusted the auction house with the auction of fur and other items, deliberately raising the price, and a partner bid for 6,000 yuan. He then used this voucher to purchase 6,000 yuan of fire insurance, mixed it into the warehouse, and then tried to set a fire to seek compensation. From this, we can know that the organization of this "arson business" is not as simple as we thought. It is not only organized, but also planned. At the same time, what we should not ignore is that they even spare no effort to manufacture arson machines to carry out this conspiracy. It can be seen that this matter is not unusual.</p>
<p>Now that it has been cracked, the excitement-loving Shanghai people have of course gained a new perspective. The results of the crime and the sentencing are not within the scope of this topic, and we will not care about it. Here, we just want to write some thoughts on the cause and effect of this crime.</p>
<p>Crime has become organized, which is the result of modern civilization and so-called scientific management. At the same time, turning it around, if we only passively prevent it beforehand, or severely punish it afterwards; that will not reduce the number of criminal cases. On the contrary, it will only make criminals more and more careful and alarming day by day. This is because the question of whether this problem is solved by sentencing is raised. For example, arson, although it occasionally happened in the past, was nothing more than the evolution of "when poor, one seeks change, and when change, one achieves success." It will not be as organized and methodical as this case is now. It is conceivable how serious it is to manufacture machines for arson. But, why do they have to "rack their brains" for a crime? Why waste such energy on planning crimes? The answer is very simple, it is nothing more than: "They want to live, they have to eat; and this society does not give them food, so they have to "take risks"." Because this "arson" can "make a living" after all, and it is still "profitable," they have to do so for life. Then, if we can understand this, there is nothing strange.</p>
<h3>Stealing Crops Thief</h3>
<p>— Shihua</p>
<p>On the dark green horizon, stars twinkled with milky white light, flying aimlessly in the sky. Behind the clouds, a light shone through, and the dark green horizon showed violet; later, it added gold and rose, and the sky became a gentle pale purple.</p>
<p>The moon, which was about eight or nine points round, scattered milky white light. The wild and bright river surface was strangely quiet, and the waves were extraordinarily calm. The moon was reflected on the water surface, still a round one.</p>
<p>"No wonder the moon is so good tonight, it turns out it's only the eighteenth." The young man, who was about fifteen or sixteen years old, was quite strong, but he was a little short. His face was round, and he smiled like a cat. His wide mouth really made people laugh.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you're pretending to be gentle. Go to sleep quickly, be careful someone will steal crops tonight." This one was taller, but his body was not as strong as the other one. Even if you compared their arms, the difference was far. At this time, he was lying on the mat, with half of his body covered with broken cotton, and he was pulling the sitting companion next to him with all his strength, meaning for him to lie down.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, with such a good moon tonight, are you still afraid that those "petty thieves" will come to steal crops?"</p>
<p>"Taogen, it's not that I, Alongsheng, am getting old today. Maybe there will be a big fog tonight. If someone steals it, you'll be unlucky."</p>
<p>Taogen was half-believing and half-unbelieving, but he had no choice but to lie down.</p>
<p>The night was already very light. In the wilderness, it was quiet, like death.</p>
<p>It really was foggy! The moon seemed to be covered with a thick veil, and the light faded as a result. The ground also seemed to be covered with a layer of black yarn. The river surface was filled with thick moisture. The few trees along the river, as if they had climbed onto a thick spider web, were heavy, and the wind could not penetrate.</p>
<p>The fog was really deep, and the earth was so dark that it could not be darker. It was pitch black, and even the dogs were afraid to bark. The wind was blowing in the west rice field, and you could only hear the whistling sound, but you could not see the shaking thing. If someone was on the road at this time, they would definitely step into the river.</p>
<p>"Listen, there's someone." The sound was so small that it was almost inaudible.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>inaudible.</p>
<p>"Um—" Wiping his eyes, Taogen thought he hadn't opened them, but he didn't know it was the dimness of the fog.</p>
<p>"Oh!" A good beating. Taogen raised his fist in the air, but he didn't see it.</p>
<p>"Follow me." The two of them quietly walked on tiptoes.</p>
<p>Over there, there was still the "crick crick" sound of harvesting, which was strangely slow, like an unskilled novice.</p>
<p>The two of them quietly walked to a place not far from the harvesting sound. The crop-stealing thief didn't seem to know yet, and was still harvesting. At this time, Alongsheng shook his body, took out the small knife, and shouted "Come on," and rushed over there. Taogen also followed quickly.</p>
<p>The crop-stealing thief was strangely weak. Alongsheng gently grabbed him and threw him to the ground. Four fists fell on the strangely thin body, like chopping wood.</p>
<p>The crop-stealing thief silently let them beat him, without fighting back or begging for mercy. He was as if he was dead.</p>
<p>"Oh, why don't you make a sound? Alongsheng, light a fire and take a look, don't let him play dead, hum, this cunning thief." Saying that, he threw another punch.</p>
<p>"Ah! Sin." The remaining half of the match was thrown on the ground and extinguished. Alongsheng sat down indifferently.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Taogen thought he had been hit by a hidden weapon.</p>
<p>"It's your grandpa!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"It's your grandpa!"</p>
<p>"My grandpa?"</p>
<p>The two children helped the thief on the ground up. The old man's face was covered with mud and blood, and he was panting more fiercely than anything else. It was really Taogen's grandpa.</p>
<p>At this time, he seemed to feel a little more comfortable, and weakly opened his eyelids a little, and then closed them again. Only heard him saying softly.</p>
<p>"Tao'er, you are too loyal."</p>
<h3>The Madman</h3>
<p>— Yun Hai</p>
<p>Early morning. The sky was just beginning to turn white.</p>
<p>The only rooster in this waterside village, the one raised by the old rich man, was crowing loudly. Its voice was so resonant that it woke everyone from their dreams.</p>
<p>From the boathouses (Note), women with disheveled hair emerged, stretching and yawning, to begin their day's work. Some went to the opposite Luo Village to help out with chores, living the life of those on land; others, whose husbands had gone to sea for the fishing season, scattered in small boats to Yangjia Port to cast nets, hoping to catch some fish to sell at the Longtou market the next day for rice money. Thus, they began their busy day. Some were spreading nets, others were grabbing oars and heading to the seaside to push their boats. Everyone focused all their energy on their work, humming a few salty sea shanties to harmonize with the air.</p>
<p>The sun emerged from the water after taking a bath, straightening up, its eyes staring as if it barely recognized the land after a night's separation. The sunlight was not yet scorching, it was gentle and loving, caressing the reddish-brown skin of the people, as if encouraging them: Take courage! Living is about struggle!</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Fu and Third Aunt were teaming up for an early morning netting session. Because it was the end of autumn, the early morning tide in the first part of the month was rushing in. Catching a netful under the tide's head would yield at least twenty or thirty catties, enough to sell for a good price and eat well for a few days. Isn't that right? Everyone wants to climb higher, one day at a time, hoping for the next day to be better than the last.</p>
<p>"Isn't Brother Afu up yet? People get lazy when they rest. Today is a big tide, it would be better to catch more if he could come and help. My Aniu is young and not..." Third Aunt said to Sister-in-law Fu, counting the days on her fingers as if remembering something.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll go and call him!" Sister-in-law Fu replied casually, but she didn't immediately go back to call her husband. She was hesitating. She knew very well what kind of temper Brother Afu, who had been unemployed for several months, had. He loved to argue and scold, and in the middle of the night, he would go to play mahjong and drink shuangzheng liquor miles away from the village. When the game broke up, he would stagger back, humming and swaying, arriving home just in time to get on everyone's nerves. Yesterday, he didn't come back until one or two in the morning, just before dawn. If she disturbed him now, wouldn't she be asking for a slap? Therefore, Sister-in-law Fu hesitated.</p>
<p>The headstrong Third Aunt didn't forgive her, and shouted, "Go if you're going! It'll be too late when the sun is over the hill!"</p>
<p>"Go! Go!... Um, Third Aunt, you know his temper hasn't been good lately. I'm afraid I won't get anything good, and might even get punched!"</p>
<p>"Afraid of your own husband revealing your secrets, isn't he as lazy as a snake in hibernation? And this is for everyone's meal..."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Fu got angry, and without waiting for the headstrong Third Aunt to finish speaking, she hurried back to their broken boathouse.</p>
<p>At this moment, the whole waterside village was alive with sunlight. Although prolonged hunger plagued it, making it look like a dying yellow dog, panting and drooling, it sometimes appeared quite imposing. The row of pine trees along the river neatly guarded this famine-stricken village. At this moment, they looked even more beautiful as the wind swayed them.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Fu squeezed into the broken boathouse and whispered, "Hey! Hey! Wake up! It's a big tide this morning, Third Aunt said she needs your help! Hey, hey!"</p>
<p>"Ugh..." He lazily turned to his side and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>After Sister-in-law Fu had impatiently nagged for a few moments, she finally stirred up our Brother Afu's sleepy anger. With sleepy eyes and a drowsy head, he remembered what the group had said at Dexing Restaurant last night, and suddenly jumped out of bed, lunging at the unlucky Sister-in-law Fu, shouting and yelling—</p>
<p>"You motherfucker, why did you wake me up? May your line die out, eighteen generations of your mother's rotten cunt, you're all a jinx, bringing bad luck into the house, damn rotten thing, I'll beat you to death, you old whore..."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Fu was driven out without rhyme or reason. He followed behind like Guan Gong, dragging a broom. Even Brother Afu, known for his kindness, was beating his wife. The news spread through the village like a doomsday announcement, and those who remained came out of their boathouses to watch the show. Third Aunt, the troublemaker, stuck out her tongue and dragged her boat towards the sea. By the time Sister-in-law Fu arrived, she had already grabbed the oars and was preparing to sail to Yangjia Port.</p>
<p>Brother Afu's eyes bulged as he stared blankly as Sister-in-law Fu cried and shouted as the fishing boat set out. His cursing gradually subsided.</p>
<p>"You damn rotten cunt, raised by a whore, wanting me..."</p>
<p>He couldn't curse anymore. He lowered his head, as if ashamed, and walked away awkwardly with his hands clasped together. Unknowing children followed behind him, throwing small stones and cursing.</p>
<p>"Look, look, a turtle beating his wife!"</p>
<p>"Don't look at me as if I'm young, you are worse than animals when I grow up!"</p>
<p>He couldn't stand the rhymes the children were making up. He clenched his teeth, red veins popped up on his forehead, and he clenched his fists, wanting to beat them up for a moment of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Bang—a stone hit his brow, and even his heart ached faintly. So, he took a big step, his big round eyes blazing with fire, his hands outstretched like banana leaves, chasing after the mischievous kids.</p>
<p>The children were so frightened that they hid in their mother's arms, and the mothers closed the doors, scolding their children: "Don't play with that good-for-nothing madman."</p>
<p>(Note) When people who live on water come ashore, in addition to thatched huts, most move their broken boats ashore, which is called a boathouse.</p>
<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>— Lu Jia</p>
<p>A meandering line of trains cut through the July plains like a streak of ink.</p>
<p>The barren plains on the north bank of the Yellow River resemble the wilderness of the north, devoid of a single blade of green grass or verdant tree. Yellow earth stretches to the horizon, blending with the hazy, yellowish-sand-covered sky. The smoke from the thatched roofs rises vigorously into the evening sky, filled with sunset clouds. The colors of the twilight sky are ever-changing: streaks of orange-yellow and crimson-purple transform into flocks of sheep and camel caravans. The round, large sun sinks like a ball of fire into the long river. Travelers covered in yellow sand carry heavy luggage, trudging wearily along winding paths, as if a gust of wind could sweep them away.</p>
<p>The train car has an excessively high temperature and an excessive density of passengers, yet the train lacks high speed. A lone traveler, leaning against the window, gazes at the night falling over the fields, feeling a bit impatient and lonely.</p>
<p>The monotonous sound of the wheels accompanies the monotonous ticking of the watch on their wrist. Time passes slowly, and in the dim, weak red light, a group of vulgar faces, honest and simple faces, have two timid, tired eyes. The yawns and the coarse snores of those sleeping slumped against the backs of their seats are not a comfort but rather a repulsive sensation that makes long-distance travelers feel like vomiting. Disgusted, they avert their eyes, focusing on the quickly passing telephone poles and the simple, monotonous wilderness of the evening.</p>
<p>The earth revolves with the setting sun as its center and the steel rails as its circumference. The train runs along the arc of the circumference. Fan-shaped fields rotate, endlessly, seemingly never-ending. For travelers, calculating time and distance is the most foolish thing to do; the clever thing is how to pass the long hours, or how to let their destination arrive without them realizing it.</p>

<p>All Shanghai branch offices can handle registered express airmail and exchange savings and other services.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>But for a lone traveler, this is too difficult, too difficult.</p>
<p>A person sits in a dark corner of the train car, their chin propped on their hand, probing the width of the desolate plains with gloomy, cold, sharp eyes. The wild scenery gradually shrinks automatically, and when it shrinks until it presses against the window, the speed seems even slower. The twilight wilderness is even more monotonous, even more lonely. Besides the thick shadows and faint shadows, it is difficult to distinguish objects even if one wants to.</p>
<p>One can only feel the cool breeze from the fields by stretching one's head, face, and arms out the window. The thick air stagnating in the train car does not mix with the outside, mixed with the sweat and earth smells of the villagers. The clumsy bodies of the northerners cast swaying shadows on the ground, and their heavy breathing makes the air even more turbid. The lone traveler continues to stare at the thick night outside the small window, frowning, their anxious gaze piercing the night as if to tear it apart.</p>
<p>Passing through a wild station, flickering lights and swaying figures float on the station. The train pants as if holding its breath. Some people get off, some people get on. The lanterns outline a hazy silhouette of the wild station, and people swim in and out of the interplay of light and dark. Even though the stop is only for a minute or two, travelers feel it is a remarkably long time, and they become a little anxious.</p>
<p>Restlessly shifting in their seat, waiting for the train to roar, they rush headlong into the dark depths of the night. The solitary person stares with goat-like eyes, seemingly without feeling, facing the face of the night pressed against the window.</p>
<p>The endless journey, the endless time, is accompanied by the beating of the lone traveler's heart, the monotonous sound of the watch, and the monotonous sound of the engine.</p>

<p>Opening "Three Smiles Meeting Beauty"</p>
<p>Wu Hui talent Tang Huenyuan. Does not seek fame and does not become an official. My wonderful hand is unique in painting. My reputation is well-known in all directions. My family has eight beautiful women like flowers. There are two hundred wide peach branches in the garden. The day before yesterday, I drank happily under the wooden flower tree. I made a bet with my wife to laugh and talk. Today, I sincerely visit the beauty's door and go out. I dress up as a merchant and hide the boy. Going out of the Jin Pavilion and going around the pond all the way. I look carefully at the seven miles of Oriole flowers. Walking to the mountain road of Huqiu. I see a large official ship parked on the river. It turns out that it is the wife of Duke Longting. There are four maidservants holding incense candles. Looking carefully at her style is elegant and quiet. Among them, the young maid is the most beautiful. I heard that her name is Fangqiu Xiangzi. Her beauty can indeed be used as a meal. I have arrived at Lingshan and must pay respects to the Buddha. I lost Meng Jia's hat for no reason. Winning a smile from a beauty. A sincere guest sees a heartless smile, and a thread of love is secretly passed on. Closely following the foot of the mountain. I see a crowd of people all on the boat. How can. Yitian Gong is happy and people are Fangqiu. Blows the sails and turns the boat. Blows the beauty into my home.</p>

<p>The tears are about to run out. My lover. Hasn't come back yet. We have been looking from spring to autumn. From autumn to summer. Looking until the sea is dry and the stones are rotten. My lover. Hasn't come back yet. We are for him. The tears are about to run out. We are for him. Our hearts are about to break. Layer by layer locking the white clouds on Mount Jiuyi. Gently rippling flowing water in Dongting Lake. Do you know him? Do you know where he is? The white clouds on Mount Jiuyi gather and clear. The flowing water in Dongting Tide has ebb and flow. The clouds of sorrow in our hearts. Ah. The tears in our eyes. Ah. Will never disappear. Will always be the tide. The sun shines on the waves of Dongting. Our souls tremble and dare not sing. Waiting for the sun to set in the west. Look at the tears in the bamboo grove last night. Already blooming flowers. Ah my lover. The tear flowers are about to wither. Won't you come back?</p>

<p>Remnants of Sound</p>
<p>Ding Wane's Shanghai Opera, which is broadcast on New Sound Radio (1380) from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM every afternoon, has recently organized a class of children's Shanghai Opera, all of whom are children over ten years old, and it is said that yesterday they had already joined the Dayunlou Singing Team, and the audience was very welcome.</p>
<p>After moving to McDougall Road, China Radio Station (1080) will broadcast a special program in conjunction with Lao Jiefu Silk and Satin Bureau on the tenth of this month. I think the wonderful programs held by the United Huade Pharmacy will definitely be a grand event.</p>
<p>The Social English in Books taught by Shanghai English School is very popular among people in the society. Therefore, in addition to teaching a class at Li Shude Hall (1940) from 5:00 PM to 5:50 PM, English experts will broadcast from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM. Those who want to purchase the book can go directly to the school at 671 Edward Road or purchase it from the painting department of this newspaper. Now readers want to purchase all the machinery of the four-level exhibition broadcast platform of Watt and above. If there is anyone who wants to transfer it, please provide the price and machinery description. This editorial office will collect it and arrange a meeting if it is suitable.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>"Guangling Tide" Interlude "Reviving the Nation"</h3>
<p>"Guangling Tide" is a famous novel, and Yihua Company has now selected Chen Kengran to write and direct it. It has been in production for half a year and cost 80,000 yuan. The interlude in the film, "Reviving the Nation," is majestic and passionate. According to this song, it was composed by Yan Gefan and the lyrics were written by Huang Jiping.</p>
<p>(1) Compatriots! Compatriots! My dearest compatriots! Awaken the masses, work for the country, if you don't get up again, the country will not be protected, the enemy is encroaching step by step, who allows you to be happy and carefree, everyone work together to eliminate the enemy, saving the country is today!</p>
<p>(2) Liberation! Liberation! The Chinese nation wants liberation! For nearly a hundred years, national affairs have been chaotic, iron shackles and chains have been heavy and difficult to bear, imperialism is ferocious and cruel, like tigers, leopards, and wolves, everyone work together to break free from the shackles and sing hand in hand!</p>
<p>(3) Freedom! Freedom! Strive for national freedom! People all over the country, take neat steps, aim at the goal and share the enemy's hatred, unite the world's small nations, stand up and work hard. Everyone work together, our hot blood flows, return our freedom.</p>

<h3>Shanghai will screen "Circus"</h3>
<p>Human beings are equal, there is no discrimination based on race or ethnicity. Whether red, yellow, or black, all have equal rights. This is the theme of "Circus." But such a great theme is like a flower of blood, it unfolds in a relaxed tone, and even the most prejudiced person can hardly say it has propaganda implications, which cannot but be attributed to skill. Soviet directors are now widely using "form to assist content" to supplement "content determines form." If this sentence is correct.</p>
<p>"Circus" tells the story of an American female artist who is ostracized by "civilized people" and deported for having a black child with a black man. She fled to the Soviet Union, and because of her superb skills, she was loved by the masses in this country of national equality. Although her leader publicly announced her "secret" (relationship with a black man), the Soviet audience instead picked up the black child and sang a lullaby.</p>
<p>The greatness of the musical number is due to the fact that it is state-run, and even the United States pales in comparison.</p>
<p>After this film passes inspection, it will be screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>"Drama Joint Society" Organizes Staff Entertainment Programs</h3>
<p>The "Drama Club" has been renamed "Drama Friendship Society" by a resolution of the executive committee. The reading room will be officially opened today for public viewing. At the same time, it will organize staff entertainment programs and prepare to set up "Drama Art Teaching Classes." The first week's entertainment programs are: Monday night at 8:00 PM Ouyang Yuqian will lecture on "The Private Lives of Foreign Dramatists"; Friday night at 7:00 PM Lu will organize a world-famous music concert; Sunday night at 8:00 PM Tang Na Lan Ping will organize a chocolate tea party, welcoming staff to participate freely, but the chocolate tea party requires a fee of one dime.</p>
