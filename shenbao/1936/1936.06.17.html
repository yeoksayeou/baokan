<p>華北情勢始終不是沉靜的尤其是當國內發生變故的當兒華北的危機更以加强的速度進展著謀我者正在充分利用我國人民目光移轉的機會作它進取的掩護加緊遂行其一貫的擴展政策諸凡軍事的政治的以及經濟的無一不在積極的佈置最近大批大批的異國軍隊都開到平津一帶來了而在平漢平綏北寗三綫交叉點的豐台還更圈地建築飛機塲和兵營同時殷逆汝耕又在通州設立兵工廠這些都是他們在軍事上作進一步控制的明證至於政治上的刦奪也是非常明顯冀察政委會所遭受的壓迫已達到最後關頭了此外如走私的愈形猖獗「新關稅制度」的行將成立以及開發富源的活躍等等都是華北經濟上離心的演進</p>
<p>而且實際還不止此這些還只是平津一帶部分的寫實目前內蒙晋魯方面的危機也正不下於平津而尤以內蒙所表現的較為明顯據華聯社七日電「內蒙日人最近激增至六千餘人此等日人名義上經商設學校實際上聯絡蒙民鼓動『自治』德王府日籍顧問三十餘人朝夕不離德王」云云可見情勢嚴重一的斑又如最近傳作義訪閻商討綏遠重要問題雖其談話結果如何尙未明悉但多少反映着綏省局面之未可樂觀誠有如密勒氏評論報所說不但是平津就是察哈爾和綏遠也已够可慮了</p>
<p>日本新任大使川越茂氏已携帶「訓令」來華據說其所携帶的訓令將不變更所謂「廣田三原則」倫敦政界曾預料日本今夏對華將重採軍事行動而日本駐華軍部要人速日正在津舉行幹部會議從這種種的聯繫上可知未來的局勢正難設想在國家遭逢這樣危殆關頭的時候我們內部的芥蒂有何不可消釋我們自己的意氣又有何不可隱忍呢</p>

不齊。在昔每打可制十副，今則尺碼減少，祇能制七八副，此一進一出間，腸廠暗耗頗钜也。　　牛羊豬腸衣之製造，大同小異。製造工人，須具熱練之技巧，從市上購進之鮮腸，經過去肉（此項工作頗難，用力輕，衣上之內難期盡淨，過重，則衣洞穿又成廢物。）以後，稱為光腸。再以腸園秤之大小，分為七級，計二十一分為一路，二十八分為二路，三十分　三路，三十二分為四路，卅四分為五路，三十六分為六路，三十六分以上為七路。分路後將三條臻成一副，　副長度為十二碼半，然後再等拌監（以食監拌之去其水份，）打把（兩付合成一把狀如拳大），裝桶（二千五百副為一桶）三種手續。至此製造工作，作部方竣。豬腸園經愈佳，羊腸適得其反，其尺度自十六分起至二十六分止，二十分以下稱一路，以上統稱二路。牛腸分大小兩種，大者尺度自四十至六十分，小者自三十至四十分。　　上海每日宰豬約用二千五百頭，其腸僅供一桶之需，現今上海腸廠可日出十桶，由是以觀，上海腸衣來源，十分之必皆仰賴外埠也。　　三·出口及捐稅　腸衣之用途，為制造臘腸，國內銷路式微，令廣邦幫略有去路，但歐美各國銷路極廣，無論貧富，均喜食之，故腸衣在出口貿易上亦占重要地位。對外輸出以德國為最，法荷美等次之。歐戰時期，出口暢旺，旋複頗形清淡。民十五年，傳聞美國因華腸欠缺衛生，將實行禁止進口，同時其他各國商人亦恐政府禁止，　起采購囤積，以便居奇，故是年銷路頗旺。旋美國實施禁令，我國輸出逐減。其後上生活費特別市政府設立上海牲腸出口檢驗所，開始檢驗，民十八年七月移歸上海商品檢驗所辦理。其檢驗要點如下：一·斷定腸衣之來源，二·檢查腸廠及其工作人員，三·裝桶時之檢驗。檢驗合格，方准出口，自此以後，美國取消禁令，各國亦認為滿意，銷路逐得以恢復。近年銷數之突增，與世界擴充軍備，不無關係。下表為二十四年度輸出概況，其中豬腸由上海輸出者占多數，羊腸則以天津權　較钜（數量單位公擔，價值單位元）：申報國貨專刊貢獻話南通之觀感  仰葊　　南通，為中國工業之策源地。紡織事業，尤為南通為鼻祖。南通人之於國貨，實有極大貢獻。吾行南通，市上外貨不易見，而到處販賣國貨服用國貨，酒樓旅館之飲食用品，亦以國貨為主要點。通人衣料，自產自給，尤為可法，而值得敬佩。　　大生紗廠，年有一千六百萬元之營業額。南通一帶產花衣，年有一百五十萬擔。其農村收入之額亦可觀，此皆實藏也，宜如保發揮而光大之。　秉文君言：「中國人手持金飯碗，而向人乞食。」願持金飯碗者，珍重及此。　　土布市場，為南通新興事業，驗市之認真，尤為可法。此為提倡國貨之根本辦法，希望現進一步，設立產銷公司，規定標凖，庶大量土布，可以發展於外地，此則觀感之余，尤願與通人一商榷之。推行國貨前途的障礙物  筱石　　矯正社會錯誤心理　激勵人人愛用國貨　　自走私之風盛行以來，國貨的推銷，愈形呆滯，劣貨的勢力，益見活動，愛國志士，日夜焦思，正謀所以挽救之策。而吾近來各方接觸，所見所聞，有不忍言，更不得不言，以期矯正社會差誤心理，激勵人人愛用國貨。　　某甲某乙，因年來專門販賣某貨，大發其財，本一貧窮子，今已擁有數萬，或數十萬矣，社會人們，淺見者多，見到此舉平地青雲，無不嘖嘖稱羨，鹹思步其後塵，以國發財。鳴呼！影響所及，尚堪問耶？此輩只願個人私利，怎還願到國家前途的興亡？更怎還相到亡國的痛苦？我們既不能用法律裁制他，惟有用淘逍　來製裁他，至秒限度，要加上他一個奸商的頭銜，藉以警惕其覺悟！　　學生不是現代最高貴的份子嗎？沒有不知愛國者。然而還不免有一部分學生，他們購買東西時，只貪色美樣時，價錢便宜，店員之有良心者，明白的告訴他，冀以提醒他，然而他到　買了非國貨而去，遭是愛國商人告訴吾的　　。吾想—青年愛美的心理，人人皆同，不過若只知愛美，不知愛國，一旦國破家亡。親愛的學生們呀！有則改之，無則回勉。　　外人經商的手段，真是　　，有某國人，在大都市中，設立機關，蘇人定貨後，即可加上某公司某商號牌子，陳列店中，雖還也說他不是國貨？還有一般本國的憐一般真愛的同胞，受其騙　莫明其妙，自走私風　以後，道套　法，更見活動，結束，真國貨，終被假國貨　倒。　　物必自腐，而後蠢生，我們不改怪外貨侵入的厲害，只怪國人自己的不爭氣；荀國人大家肯爭一口氣，認定國貨是我們的國寶，服用國貨，是國的天職，就是外貨堆積如山，也不能來奪我國貨的銷路。所以吾最後的希望，要大家認　吾是中華民國的一個國民，吾不來提倡國貨，服用國貨，試問：凡是不願做奴隸的人們，都有熱心來盡過責任的。能這樣，國貨前途的障礙物，也自會完全消滅了。經濟電燈發明人訪問記  孟　　在這農村經濟崩潰！商業是感受到的極度的衰落！夥員被裁，失業問題嚴重！開源既無望？而緊縮節流，以極經濟的節省支出方法，是為一般人所重視了！　　吾主張名人的訪問，應轉變筆鋒，訪問國貨的發明人，較為實際！　　余舊友錢味青先生哲嗣公偉君於去年春季，從事研究經濟電燈，孜孜不倦，經半載之奮鬥！終告厥成！某日，余往訪問，愛誌之如次：　　錢公偉君，吳興人，一二十余歲之好學青年也，活潑精幹！見余握手話舊，並出示發明經濟電燈獲前實業部長陳公博氏批准特許專利等情，當經發交獎勵工業技術審查委員會審查，茲據該會報告審查之該項經濟電燈，應准專利五年，俟公告六個月期滿，如無利害關係人提起異議，即准照章繳費，具領證書雲，錢君告我公告期已於二月十二日期滿，當照章具領證書，言下極快慰，並雲，已糾集股本數萬元他設製造工廠於無錫，購置最新式機器，顧用精細女工，俾出品迅速，以供社會之迫切需要，該項電燈，經濟極點，因電流經過方棚式之構造機件後，電光能更發明亮！而電之銷耗反經濟，理由是增加安倍，使電壓力減低，一反安倍少而電毫六絲，一個月統計，僅費銀八分六厘四毫，日每合算祇費銅元兩枚光景，較之燃火油燈尤省數倍！　　吾想旅館和家庭方面，如果改用經濟電燈，雖通宵燃點，所費甚微，確可減省旅館開支，家庭負後果，深信必可得到大家歡迎的，臨行承錢君惠我一盞，試點果甚滿意！我在這裏介紹給國貨界和讀者，並敬祝線君事業的光大！嚴密同業組織與肅清私貨  孟昭　　諺云「籬笆紮得緊，野狗鑽勿進」吾國淪於次殖民地，六戶洞開，野狗亂鑽！走私的嚴重，已成公開的猖獗！肅清私貨運動，各方雖積極進行，惟「見利忘義」為商人通病！他們「飲酖止渴」罔知毀　生命！故商人團體，　應嚴密同業組織，互相監視，互相規勉！以販賣私貨，為可恥！一經舉發，處罰不容稍寬，獎勵告密，格外從優！務使奸商　知販賣私貨之不容於天地，懼身之不容於天地，懼身陷縲絏，而相互悚戒！如是步步為營，私貨終有絕遺跡的一天！具天良的同胞商人，其勉乎哉！不買走私貨  奇中　　關稅走私，不僅是國貨的致命傷，實在也是洋貨的致命傷，所以這個問題，不令我國人要急謀解決，就是歐美人也是要急謀解決的；人也是要急謀解決的；不然，不久的將來，我們的國貨工廠要完全倒閉，就是歐美商人，也只好束裝回國，　　問題的重大　還在我們自身，歐美人最多不做生意，我國人勢必亡國。所以，這個問題我們不必希望歐美人來代我解決，我們要自己來解決才好。　　我們來一個「不買走私貨」運動吧！同胞們，為自己的國貨，為自己國家的命脈，這「不買走私貨運動」，是等重要的啊！我們不是鬧著「什麼年」什麼年嗎？我們現在來定今年的下半年為「不買走私貨年」我想熱心的同胞，當然高興而贊成的吧！國貨界又一新貢獻  倚　　范鳳源發明自制防彈玻璃　　在外國發明已久之防彈玻璃，其於現代之用途甚廣。此種舶來品進口之代價，異常昂貴。我國最近有化學工程師范鳳源君，自行創制防彈玻璃。是項發明，不特在國貨玻璃工業上又一新發展，且每年亦可節省不少之外漏也。茲將范君發明之經過與其略曆分述於後：　　范君在國內化學工程界，素有相當聲望，年來尤致力化學工程之研究，自設有「鳳源化學研究室」，最近鑒於玻璃工業之重要，即著手是項研究，目下除已發明玻璃之染色外，並發明此防彈玻璃，其成效符合世界標准。茲將其原料及化合物，錄之如下：……以上各種原料，須用高熱度燒至攝氏一八〇〇度，　能融成。其用途頗廣；除保障人民居住車輛之安全外，兵　，飛機以及坦克車上，均需用之。盡在鋼鐵防衛之下，仍膛可少此種透明之保障物也。　　至范君發明成功玻璃之面積，以二〇英寸為標準，即舶來品亦然。若將重二百克之鋼球，自二米突半自然落下，玻璃絲毫無損。又二百度高溫棄，五分鐘加熱，急激把投入二〇度之水水中，雖相差一百八十度熱度，亦不致爆裂。又以十密厘厚之此種玻璃，在二〇·五米突距離間，用手槍射擊，不能破裂貫穿。以上數種效用之試驗，均為近世防彈玻璃之最高標準也。　　范君略歷：范鳳源君，年三十一歲，江蘇吳縣人，交通大學理學士。民十九自資東度留學，回國後歷任建委會電機廠工程師，上海市理化實驗室主任，益利玻璃廠工程師，交通大學講師……等職。著有乾電池造法，乾電池講座，死光，毒瓦斯，無線電講議等書。先後發明者：計有橡皮套鞋漆，幹電池造法，橘子汁（能保存長入），油漆製造，光學有色玻璃及防彈玻璃等。前四種工業品，以前均系舶來品去配吾國市場，自范君發明創制後，由是國貨工廠風起雲湧，舶來品營養業一落千丈。范君對於其發明品，無不公開於世，從未成為奇貨，其精神尤難能可貴！　　國貨巨枝蚊香　蚊香，可以說是夏令的一種必需品，我最到一個訊息，就是今年市上有種巨枝的蚊香出世，這種巨枝蚊香，可以說是國貨的創制品，　的特點就是香枝巨大，（每盤可以抵細枝兩盤以上），嘖煙很濃厚，（使得蚊子一觸就死），燃點的時間也比較常，並且用一種改良的立形香架，使得蚊香絕對沒有燃到中間而熄滅了的弊病。　　這種巨枝蚊香是五洲第三廠專心研制的，過去該廠也有蚊香出品，不過現在更能切實的改善，所以我樂意的寫出來為國人介紹。（華飛）來函　　逕啟者查十日　書報國貨專刋登載陸仲文案良發明「旋轉式三用電燈泡」一文署名者呆敝會覽育之餘　其中與事實不符且有不顧實際過事宜傳之處（中略）殊與　貴報提倡國貨之旨大相背證查年來國貨電泡如亞浦耳華德新光華等牌早為全國所贊許出品之精用電之省均經精密測騐確能合乎標準證以本市華界各機關法租界之路燈所用電泡均由亞浦耳供給可資確據敝會為電器製造業集團見聞較切審核較說對於此種稿件足損害敝會全體電泡廠之營業敬請　貴報即日更正為荷　此致　　主筆先生　上海市電器製造業同業公會啟</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （闌刪）　　人們的　點，是只顧其前，真顧其後的。小中見大，就拿下雨天來說，我們撑傘子，只會得保護前面，那把傘也只是偏向前面，儘讓自己的背部和後肩，給雨淋得一塌糊塗，也似乎不甚介意。原因是：前面給淋濕了，自己看得見，不得不極力照顧：但後面濕了，沒有後顧的眼睛，便作爲看不見，於是也不擺在心上了。——那把傘永是向前偏！　　當我們吃花生米和瓜子之類時，大家總先揀取那些肥大的吃着，等到吃畢之前，所残餘的都是一些幹　而不中吃的了：但却捨不得白丢了去，還是向嘴裏送，往往在還時候吃到些臭花生，急拿茶水漱口不迭。這也是顧前不顧後之過。如果肯將幾粒肥大的留在末尾吃，而將不中看的先吃了，到吃若臭花生時，還有肥大的可以過口。防微杜漸，其此之謂乎？黃浦灘頭  花鈴　　海市蜃樓那麼也似的鐵甲巡洋艦，掛超着國籍不同的旗幟，一條一條的駐泊在有時靜靜地躺着，有時怒吼着一二聲的黄浦江流中，雄糾糾，氣昂昂，鎭攝着遠東的一個龐大的次殖民地。　　在岸土，整齊地排列着的，一是各種形式的摩天樓，一孕含着無數的經濟機關，握着全上海的經濟的樞鈕，間接地握着全中國的經濟的樞鈕。這些兒摩天樓中，孕含着繁榮上海的活力，同時，也孕含着榨取中國的吸血者。　　草坪，靜靜地躺在寬廣的街道，舆浦濱的貨車道之間，一頭站着的，一是維持世界和平的和平之神，二頭站着的，是助中國削平反亂的西方人英雄。英雄與和平，老是那麼的遙遙相對着，給與我人以無限的回味。　　電車，汽車，像穿梭也似的，在摩天樓前的街道上交織着。每天的上午，載運着大批的麵包追逐者，去追逐麵包，下午，更載運着大批的麵包追逐者，回家去休息。人行道上的行人，也忙忙碌碌地來來去去，追逐麵包。雖然大部分，都装成了紳士的模樣，在實際上，可遊不是大批兒的在飢餓綫上打着轉麼？　　汽油船，碼頭船，舢舨船，不住地靠着碼頭，更從碼頭旁驶開去。人老是那麼不絕的擁上碼頭，擁上各種不同的船艘去。在浦濱，在海關碼頭上，老是有閒適的人們，在徘徊着。徘徊着，可眞是閒適麼？唔，這些，或許就是擠不進職業圈去的一羣，徘徊着，聊以忘憂而已。　　在黄昏中，黄浦灘頭，是充滿着愉快的空氣的，穿着大脚袴的水兵們，都懷着一顆跳躍的心，分往朱葆二路，霞飛路，百老匯路，北四川路等神秘所在去。但是在另一角裏所傳出的却是慘然的運貨工人的「耶許」之聾。南滙的賣鹽生活  朱庭筠　　南匯本來是地近海濱，農產豐富的區域，可是近幾年來在農村破產的高潮下，使得一班入無田叫耕。因此，因了向都市裏狂奔以外，其餘的一部份，便不得不冒險去幹這賣私鹽的生活了。　　這一班人的體格，都是身強力壯的。他們在天還沒亮清以前，便挑着兩隻空籃，向着海濱產鹽的區域裏批了來，偷偷的向各處鄉村裏販賣，每天走上百把里路是不算一回事，因爲這一種鹽沒有納過稅，所以利益是很厚的，大概每擔鹽有一元到二元可賺，可是當局緝捕得很是嚴厲，一旦被捕，非但把鹽完全充公，而且皮肉上也得受極大的痛苦，所以現在男子們都不敢再幹，而由强健的婦女去賣，不過伊們的這稀生活，也是够悽慘的。鄉前輩黄季昆氏有一首古詩道。宵征天未凉，衣濕露中草，一程又一程，程程險蜀道，小姑年還小，翁姑年已老，縱曰有男丁，男丁忙植稻，途中憂風波，家中憂襁褓，呱呱一塊肉，愛之如珍寶，出門再叮嚀；乳乞憐家嫂，嗟嗟肩上物，脫售但求早，或說東行便，或謂西行好，究竟熟爲穩，不遑細參考，同伴蹈危機，聞風心如擣，阿儂幸而免，默默一慘笑，麥飯充飢腸，形容半枯稿，足力苦不勝，前程猶浩浩，偶聞喚買聞，喑喑謝蒼昊，秤重價亦廉，召氣莫懊惱，譬如遇險時，生命且不保。聽雨兩記  季芝　　清早就下着雨，寂寞地一個人祇得聽雨。我一件曾聽過兩回好雨，富詩意，饒雅趣，直不可不記。　　一回是在浩渺的陽澄湖中，僅能踡臥不容直立的一葉扁舟上，時間在春夜，最初是明月皓潔，星斗滿天，但倏忽地烏雲疾至，急雨隨來，湖水如沸。急促的雨點打在小舟的艙上，如撾鼓。聽舟外暴風暴雨，像千軍萬馬的奔騰！織成了一派偉大雄壯的音樂。　　一回是在蘇州桃花塢旅邸，時間在秋夜，那時窗外荷葉未殘，修竹正茂，夜半朦朧間似聞細聲低語，如碎璧玉，如搖瓊珮，瀟瀟灑灑，清脆可聽—　成了一派清脆幽雅的音樂。　　我愛聽雄壯的音樂，我也愛聽清幽的音樂。　　但不知道此生還有清福得重聽雄壯或清幽的音樂否？蠶豆  方正　　溫和的季節風，吹大了桑葉，又吹熱了蠶豆！是初夏了。夏雖是個令人厭惡的季節，然而隨夏而產生的蠶豆却也值得我們歌頌吧！　　說起蠶豆，我似乎是其中老手，這話不是言過其實，因爲我故鄉既有出產，而到了上海後，又在鄉間服務了五六年，因此蠶豆給我一個深刻的印象！　　蠶豆雖是夏季裏一種優美的食品，然而烹煮不得法，亦如嚼臘般無味，所以最好要略諳烹煮法，但是方法太多，例如炒的，湯的，油吞的，硬的，眞有些名目繁多，不勝枚舉，呌人去學那一種好呢？我意首推第一種了。現在把炒法略述如下：是先放在清水裏漂十分鐘，然後取出，放在預備的油鍋裏炒就是了，不過火須小，也不可急，再放些一嫩竹筍，白糖，略加清水，這便成功了．那末吃起來，既甜而又清香，真別有一種風味！然而這種美味祇有鄉間才嘗得到，因爲市上所售的，大都採下幾天，其味當然要略遜了。　　可是人們祇知味美，却不知種的人，費了幾許精神和血汗，的確可拿朱伯廬先生的「一粥一飯，當知來處不易」來形容的。因爲蠶豆這東西，是不易種大的，既怕熱，又怕旱，而且當它結實的時候，又要人時常去巡邏，以防牛吃和人偷，甚至晚上都不敢安然睡眠！而所得到的代價，說來却很驚人，原來普通祇售八個銅元一斤，而小菜塲上挑着呌賣的，每斤祇六個銅元哩，還得不到賣主的同情！　　我以爲蠶豆還缺乏利用，假使如能似梅子可製陳皮梅，又如柿子可製柿餅的利用，那末也不能不說是農村一條小出路！三夫人廟人迎曲  陳翠娜　　髑　　哭百草　，地下占釵斷龍尾，嬋媛訴天雲　重，鬱鬱芳　聞上帝，陰風吹　　　地，古月避愁入波底，蛇籘壞綠縛松骨，門外銅駝淚如洗。（其一）　　天門雷動開風雲，巫陽　髮呼眞神，深　密菁迷不歸，濕苔萬里空無人，翠華搖搖拂若木，宮女攀天抱龍哭，翠弓射日墜如雨，妖鳥呀呀作人語。（其二）　　碧雲日暮吹參差，與君期兮南山陲，天倾地坼不得語，懷芳抱潔無所歸，鳳凰失伍羞羣雞，眾女謠諑輕蛾眉，風雲縹緲吾將行，遺天地兮外死生，龍駕車兮虎鼓瑟，樂千載兮　且寗。（其三）古典面孔  淑　　今夕摩登姑娘，面孔上的修飾務一不在復古，於何證之，請檢古書！　　細眉——白居易「上陽白髮人」云：「青黛點眉眉細長，」溫庭筠南歌子云：連絹細掃眉，」　　朱唇—清異綠載，唐代都中倡家競尚妝脣，有「萬金紅」「石榴嬌」「大紅春」諸名目，　　黄頰—歐陽修「使　錄云」「胡婦以黄物塗面妆，謂之物妝　　　誌謝　第八期「康健世界」日刊、爲夏令衛生特大號、已於今日出版、所有文字、俱係防疫運動夏令衛生之必需常識、全書九十餘回、書報亦較平常加倍、圖文精萃、零售每冊一角、如向上海同孚路二一四弄一四號康健世界社預定、全年十二冊連郵只國幣五角、承贈特謝、换巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第三回　雨細風斜還　留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書　　大概他走五分鐘的時候，必定橫起右手臂來，看一看手表。天下事果然是無獨有偶的，對面來了一個人，也是在看手表，及至彼此抬起頭來，倒　有吃　的樣子。因爲那個來的，便是江小姐。國器早就預備好了的，假使人家這次向自己發了淺笑，自己就得更進一步，向人家深深的一笑。人家若是深深的一笑呢？那就得和人家點上一個頭。可是到了這時，全吃了一驚，女的來不及微笑，男的也來不及深笑與點頭。而且女的是有點含羞的樣子，臉也紅了。國器這就不敢正眼兒的看着，自低着頭走開了去。回别家裏，坐在窗戶下椅子上，回想到剛才的事，心裏頭好生不快。心想着，若是照了上午所計畫的，先和他微笑，再和他點頭行禮，再和他就可以交談成爲朋友了。章老太因兒子回家以後，就到書房裏去坐着，不免有點奇怪，　就走到書房門口問道；國器，你又在想文章嗎？國器立刻迎到堂屋裏來，笑道：我不是想做文稿，我不是一歲兩歲小孩子了，倒處處要你老當心。章老太向他週身上下，都打量了一　，問道：那麼，你是想什麽呢？國器要實告母親，無　膽量。不告訴母親，又不願撒謊，便只好微微一笑。章老太道：你不要騙我，你　是想做文章。你果然是孝順親，你就是不願我掛心，你也應當說了出來。一個人要想做番事業，第一要緊，是把放得端正。第二是那不能告訴人的事，好也罷，歹也罷，總能够做。國器聽了道話，由心房裏連連跳了一陣，心念，難道這兩天所做的事，母親經知道了？一向是　人稱着，自已是個忠實少年，怎樣會做出　私自追逐人家閩秀的情來？如此一想，臉上是着一分尷尬。站在母親面前，半垂了頭，却留着天井裏的樹子發呆。章老太笑道：一起你來，你倒有些不好意思了。我没有別的意思，我是看到看書要用心，到學堂裏去書也用心，現在索性坐着没事也用心，將來會把心事都挖空。國器勉强答應了一旬道那也不至於呵！可是他這樣淡淡的表示着，章老太也就不追了。當晚，他想了一晚上最後决定了，自己雖然年輕，究竞還是一個教員。豈有教員的人，天天舍正路不，在別一倏路上，去等候人家姑娘路過的？（三六）遊踪所至齊雲仙境  沈軼劉　　自屯景路之休祁段，乘公路長途汽車入白岳，爲境頗秘，白岳土名齊雲山弧峙皖西南，遙控黃山，相距百餘里，休祁名勝也，嚮者交通梗塞，人跡罕至，其名兼爲黃山掩襲，竟至不入遠方探幽人士之笈；然一入深秋，香火綦盛，皖東北，浙西南，以迄贛之德興，浮梁諸處，　石舉國若狂，朝山進香，沿爲大典，蓋自有其歷史之價值在也。予既飽覽黄嶽，下湯口，轉車南行，凡百五十里至屯溪，就站換登西行車，以通車未久，人多車少，不敷分配，莫能行。宿逆旅中，凌晨入站，則見旅客如蟻，後至略無微隙，購票不獲，出站索專車，直放巖脚站，三十里過体甯城，再西三十里，覩萬山雲起，平疇漸稀，迎面，山，遙峯如黛，嵯峨麗天，有異羣岫，方擬就詢御者，而車戛然止，蓋已抵岩脚，下車望前峯，則固白岳也。循站南行，有村集可容茗盥，小憩四望，原野盡爲衆山屏蔽，數十里間，莫見人烟。度溪橋前進，危樟七八，古杉雜之，蔚乎深秀，稍轉，巳近荒落，山氣颯然，撲襟作高爽；五里入白岳境，長松夾道，山程數轉，豐碑兀立，顏曰「齊雲仙境」、字跡秀偉，光大山靈．徐進七八里，一峯兀峙，中虛若門，曰「天門」皚旋而上，及門坎，古碑無數，刻前仟紀游詩，清聖祖之卿碑亦在焉。越門下，豁然是異觀，天宇空曠，奇峯環蔽，其下廣潭澄浸，盤旋向下，岩隙有．真仙洞」，膚淺陋俗，不甚可駐足，對岩有巨摩崖四字曰：天開神秀」字大逾丈，高標半空，雄渾蒼秀，殆無能喻，舉所見各地摩崖，胥無足與之方鴐。導游之羽士，謂有人曾以百金，索土民架拓，人莫敢應，蓋削壁百丈，猿烏却視，猱升乏術，特不知何代異人，乃作狡猶如是。右望香鑪峯，小亭聳其端，白岳道觀，隱約可見，齊雲之勝，蓋極於此。再上，肓山衢，屋舍鱗比，分房標號，爲普客膳宿處；內衢踞山巔，風景尤絕，兩衢之交，道觀在焉，形勢壯偉，道場廣大，象魏崇閎，烟雲磅礴，左右前後，開展一如共度，天造地設之山塲也；而布置惡俗，迥不若僧寮之幽趣。山中羽士，多火居宗，　姓汪，籍婺源，無雜派。訊其由來，調明嘉靖時，朝命婺源汪　，來山求嗣，先期令該山羽士，設八字醮，羽士茫無以應，聞汪氏將到，羣匿不見面，洼氏入山，閱無一人，下令大索，獲廚役某於髓突中，訊之，氏籍皆同，詰其故，役以實對，汪氏乃教以八字，爲「神知我意我知神靈」，即命代庖，奏以該役世襲山中香火云，飯于詹姓房，登山，上有方臘墓，不辨眞贗，忽忽一巡，無奇勝處，蓋巳至一天門而盡矣。賦白岳詩：「黃海西來嶺又嚴，天開神秀燦雲簾，一天門外天如鏡，倒揷香鱸掛屋簷」。香鑪峰四臨絶壑，有鐵鍊可援而升，巓有亭，憑陵四望，風來欲墮，遠近諸山，變幻奔凑，又一大觀。下山，天晚，有匪警，候車不得，僱山興行，新月如鈎，山風簌簌生微寒，頗不耐，瞑目微吟曰：「携筑過白岳，日暮鳥相呼，蠟屐雲中下，征車去有無；人烟望城郭，風鶴驚萑苻，不覺籃興急，聞刁月在途。」三小時後，抵休甯城，越宿返屯溪，乃誌勝概，以揭其秘。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言好一個莊嚴的投降禮  行安　　路透社十日羅馬電：阿比西尼亞之酋長與顯貴五十人，今日衣阿國通行之大袍，在阿京參加莊嚴之投降禮，此禮乃阿比西尼亞意代理總督格拉齊亞尼上將，下令舉行者，諸人皆行法西斯敬禮，宣誓時述及意王及墨索里尼之名，由阿將布那代表諸人，宣讀投降文，內稱彼等除意大利王阿比西尼亞帝外，不承認其他權威，格拉齊亞尼上將答詞中，謂意當局擬尊重阿人之宗敎信仰。　　强者眞會欺弄弱者！意大利把阿比西尼亞用武力呑併不算，還要下令舉行一個投降禮，命五十個阿國酋長與顯貴，當塲獻醜，以鳴得意。推阿國意代理總督格拉齊亞尼上將下此命令，用意不外要向世人表示阿國人心的歸順，及使一班阿國的無恥之徒，宣誓效忠主子。然而這侮辱在我們看來，是極度難堪的。亡國的慘痛，敎人如何的傷心警怵！　　但是這怪不得意大利，可恨的倒是阿比西尼亞這五十個酋長與顯貴。這輩奸人只知求一己之榮，不惜喪盡祖國的體面，衣本國通行的大袍，在敵人的面前，行法西斯敬禮，並呼意王及墨索里尼之名，宣讀投降文，表示效忠意國，眞是十足奴隸性的表現，喪心病在，一至於此，可謂世間無恥之尤者！　　不過阿比西尼亞的醜類多得很。在意阿戰事期中，一班賣國賊，紛紛背叛祖國，向敵人投降。底格勒省會長葛夫柴，卽是第一號的阿奸。他曾率領一萬三千名阿兵，歸降意軍。墨索里尼有一個時候，計劃在阿國境內，另立新國，就是要利用這個現成的傀儡。可惜這事後來沒有實現，他不免大失所望！　　我國的情形，也是一樣的。隨外侮的使迫，漢奸層出不窮。溥儀鄭孝胥之徒，甘心作敵人的奴隸，其罪大惡極，早爲國人所唾棄，溥逆有一次親自赴某國謝聖恩，正是效忠的表示。正是效忠的表示。近來南北各地，許多無恥奸人，更形活躍。他們所作所為，盡以危害國家為能事，唯恐我國之不早亡。我國日後果不幸而蹈阿比西尼亞的慘禍，我們相信，願意參加投降禮的，當不只五十人！希望  秦淮　　搬到華北公寓不久，我說就有了一批新的朋友，所謂那批新的朋友，都談不到交情，那不過在寂寞的時候，大家凑在一起談天解悶兒，在生活上以及其他方面誰也不曾侵犯誰，這類的朋友在我們流浪人是到處都有，很多很多的。　　最初和我接言的是樓下十八號房客老范，他是個極輕的神經病患者，喜歡唱京調，幾乎每晚上他都唱幾段黃天霸的戲。舉動很惹人討厭，但因為他是省政府的科員，就沒有人敢鬥他。全公寓裏的入恐怕祗有我和他還談得來，他不論怎樣吹牛，發狂，我總是讚美他，於是他逢人便說，「樓上那位秦先生了不得，人有學問又能幹。」確乎他的話對我發生很好的收穫，帳房茶房對我特出例外的恭敬客氣，就是一般房客也都向我表示親近。　　由老范的介紹我認了一位姓劉的房客，這人如其說他老實，不如說他是混人。他住在二樓，同住的是他父親，（那老傢伙成天价抽鴉片，據說在謀一個縣長的位置。）可是他除了睡覺之外，很少留在屋子裏，他捫父子不接言，似乎結下什麼怨仇？全寓人差不多他全熟識，誰的屋他都進去，他一切時間都消磨在跟人談天上。白天他跟茶房很親密，抽簽贏來的瓜子什麼的總是和茶房一塊吃，因此那茶房可以告訴他許多近於秘密的事：那一號房裏的客人是幹什麼的，男的有沒有女朋友？那一號房裏的客人是花會跑風的，一句話，全寓裏的人的底細他都打聽得明明白白。以此他便對甲去說乙的事，對丙去說丁的事，這樣所的房客彼此都曉得誰是幹什麼的了。　　一次他來吿訴我他找到了事情，是他父親的朋友替他在省政府民政廳找的書記職。第三天他就寫履歷片，他吩咐茶房給他買了三張履歷片，回來全寫壞了，於是又買，他寫得滿頭是汗，直寫到五十八張履歷片，到底還沒有寫成功，最後簡直那茶房也膩了，已經跑了十八九趟紙店了。他再也揮不動　那枝筆了，於是他央我替他寫。次日午後他父親就帶他到民政廳去見廳長。回來他對我說：「秦先生，就是討飯吃我也不去當那書記。媽的，我到那裏廳長考問了我老半天，末了呌我寫一篇正楷小字，天哪！跟他說話時，我已經渾身是汗，那裏還能寫小字，我提起筆手直移　，好在他沒難爲我，就讓我回來了。」結果他的書記沒有做成，以後他就另打主意。　　他父親是不肯給他較多的錢花費的，但那種花錢的隨便却一定得一筆好數目的欵子！不得已他就設法驅錢用了。一天下午他拿着一套信封信紙，耍我替他寫封信。信是寄給他北平的一個表叔，偽言他父親病重，醫治用錢很急，求表叔見信之後立刻寄五十塊錢來。究竟這事成功沒有我不知道，但是他花錢還是和以前一樣的隨便。　　從此他對生活出路抱著絕望的態度，他承認自己是完兒完了，一輩子不會有出息，所以非把生活過得浪漫一點不可。不久他一位表兄從關東來到天津，他就精神煥發，每天跟着他表兄出入於×租界，中華茶樓「新旅社」，「北洋飯店」到處都有他的踪跡。但他在百忙中仍要抽空跟我談談，什麼妓女呀，白面呀，花會里怎樣容易發財呀，說起來，就沒有完。　　在他表兄回長春之後，他吿訴我，將來他有很大的希望，他表兄已經活動上了一個小學校長，而且將來有做××縣政府的財政局長的希望。等到下月他表兄來信也就可以到關外去。甚至他問我想去不想去？當然我是很婉轉的拒絕了他。我是沒有他那種「希望」的。　　老范隨着省政府搬到保定去後，我也就回北平去了。　　冬天我回天津時，恰巧碰上流氓們佔據東馬路宜講所。在那些人羣中我見到了那個姓劉的，我悄悄的避開了他。不知他的希望達到目的沒有？散工童養媳  車筠　　—鵲雀子尾巴長娶了媳婦忘了娘　　大辮子，胖胖的臉，兩隻眼睛整日一霎一霎的瞅人，嘴唇很厚，也很紅，毛藍洋標的褂子下面，是一條靑竹布大脚管褲，大板頭脚上穿一雙粉色的洋襪，兩隻靑鞋。年紀有十五歲，她名呌金環子，是二表兄老黑化了四十元錢的聘。禮「拉來的」童養媳婦。這小女人的爸爸早先在鎭上開油房，生意作得很興隆，一年賺一三百隻洋，後來不知怎麼染上了扎嗎啡的毛病，家產浪蕩光了，便要他女人到鎭上那招待來往客商的大店里，去「倍客」，這在田野上長大的農家女人有份骨氣，不甘心幹那耘下流事，就在一個黑夜里投井自殺了。老婆死後，嗎啡鬼便把念頭轉到女兒身上，因爲名聲不好，誰也不愛娶個賊坯子的閨女，女人本身也不是個上等貨色，那耘「蟲屎眠」、一霎霎並不惹人愛，二表兄老黑三月間在廟會的寶局上贏了七十多塊錢，舅母看兒子有那麼多錢，她就巴巴結結的說出那份心事來：　　「黑子我跟你商量件事，」　　「什麼事？」　　「你到年底是整三十（歲）呵，你哥哥一輩子沒娶上媳婦，跑瞎道兒長大瘡長死了。你聽娘的話娶個媳婦兒，這陣子有錢，化幾十塊拉一個，將來生個男養個女的，百年之後也好替我跟你爹上墳掛紙。」　　二表兄老黑為跟馬寡婦打姘頭挨過頓痛打，這是他這類「跑海的哥們」頂丟臉的事，便早存心弄個女人，經舅母這一提，就裂開嘴笑了笑，像有什麼東西纔着他似的，巴唧了下嘴說：　　「媽你託人辦吧，我看看頭臉不像猪八戒，咱們就化幾十，喂豬推磨的替替你。」　　挺簡便嗎啡鬼領着他女兒金環子到鎭上來趕集，在媒人家老黑瞅見這個胖達達老不愛抬腦袋的小女人，就嘬嘬嘴笑着講好了價錢，第二天女婿跟丈人直接交代，把錢數淸了嗎啡鬼先到藥針房里扎了個足上加足，便帶着女兒來婆家，午飯舅母包了二斤麵的韮菜猪肉餃子，兩親家跟沒拜堂的兩口子吃着，作婆母的看看媳婦覺得挺壯實，心里有些高興，守了二十年寡，把孩子帶大了，居然也成了婆婆。　　剛進門一個多月，小女人作事很殷勤，早上起來掃凈了扎，就到隔山灶上煮粥，吃過飯洗洗衣裳，要不就提着筐子挖猪菜去。老黑常趕外縣的廟會去擺「賓棚子，」十天半月的不來家，每回來背搭褳里銅板票子燒餅酥魚的帶一大堆，有時帶幾尺花布，作媽媽的明白是給他小媳婦的，拿着布就嚷：　　「丫頭呵，來給你裁個褂子。」　　老黑漲紅着臉，不好意思的說。　　「不給她，不給她，媽你留着。」　　老婆婆在這時候就笑著看兒子那份妞妮筋，過一歇，拉過剛走進來的媳婦，把布披到她身上說：　　「好，好，我裁了你自己學着作。」　　老黑常在這當口發了急，莽壯的喊着：　　「我給媽買的，她憑麼穿！」同時作媽的就微笑着道：　　「我五十多歲了穿花的？你打算我是個老妖精呢！」　　小女人霎着眼瞟她丈夫，突起那厚嘴唇來。　　這樣的日子老婆婆是幸福的，她慶幸着兒子的孝順。　　麥秋過後，小兩口兒常偸偸摸摸的「親熱，」小女人嘔吐了幾天，常喜歡吃個靑杏子之類的東西，婆婆知道等不得十六歲媳婦的肚子就裝上孩子了。便在六月間擇了個吉日，呌他家兩口子拜了拜祖宗，當夜就算「圓了房」（童養媳入洞房的專名詞）　　自從那天後，在賓局里有名要錢不要命的蠻漢子老黑，就伏伏貼貼的聽從小女人的話，她飯不燒了，衣服也不愛洗，整日喊有病，老黑打鎭上回來，買了各樣甜點心總是悄聲躡脚的避着媽媽，給那小女人偸偸的吃，老婆婆成天哼唉的操作着，她很想學學自己的婆母那種狠毒，可是只小聲的罵幾句，小女人等漢子一進門就哭着呌着逼他休了她，老黑每在這時候就翻起大白眼珠子來呌　：　　「要我娶，娶了來又想法拆麼，是付麼意思！」　　在這時候，老婆婆只有傷心的自己流淚，她想起「鵲雀子尾巴長……」那個兒歌來。播音節目特別節目　　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時半至六時半　　新婚燕爾（陳萍）關外高歌（沈瑛）太平花（劍虹）長記得（柴瑟）舟中曲（水卿）賣報歌（瑛瑛）薄情的女郎（陳萍）採蓮歌（沈瑛）叮叮噹太太（劍虹）（氷卿）　　怒吼歌詠團　　交通（一三〇〇）下午六時半至七時　　　挿秧歌　伏爾加　挑夫曲　扮禾歌　天倫　揚子江歌唱　　爵士歌劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　春宵曲　（露茜）　　父母子女　（曼娜）　　窮富姻緣　（金儀）　　和平歌　（張俊）　　相見訴想思　（露茜）　　努力　（曼娜）　　紅燒丈夫　（金儀）　　城市之光　（張俊）　　窮快活　（曼娜）（張俊）　　玫瑰團　　東方（一〇二〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　　Ｌady　spain　　　月圓時節　　　醉臥沙場　　　山中美人　　　可噹太太　　　新花生米　　　市上山歌　　亞東（七六〇）下午九時一刻至十時　　　Cheek　to　Cheek　　　女軍人　　　安慰　　　微微風　　　定情歌　　　節儉歌　　　拒絕　　都會歌劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　　浮雲掩月　　　鐵蹄下的歌女　　　老鳳陽歌　　　薔薇花底　　　花開爲着你　　　小蝴蝶慢飛　　蔓蘿歌劇社　　麟記（一二二〇）下午九時三刻至十時半　　王女士的鷄　（曼娜）　　鐵馬金戈　（露茜）　　勇十凱歌　（玲玲）　　安眠　（葉勵）　　愛向何處尋　（曼娜）　　紫羅闌　（露茜）　　鴛鴦怨　（玲玲）　　大都會社　　麟記（一二二〇）下十時半至十一時一刻　　夜花園裏　（綠茵）　　鐵馬金戈曲　（黛萊）　　送別　（葉英）　　漁村之歌　（綠茵）　　花生米　（黛萊）彈詞　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　徐文璧開篇　　同樂（七二〇）午夜一時至一時三刻　　開篇「紅娘寄書」　　一色杏花十里紅。鶯鶯小姐在閨中。只為西廂張君瑞。懶去窗前做女工。又因，堂前老母偏執法。一綫相思不得通。前日，紅娘來到西廂去。他說道，張相公有病在床中。奴奴欲自親身望。只為娘親家法兇。奴只得，寫一封書達張君瑞。叫他莫把，奴奴掛心胸。文房四寶忙取過。尖尖玉手把墨磨濃。輕輕落筆書成就。岡書花押疊重重。鬢邊取下靑絲髮。外面還札紅綠綫。卽忙便把紅娘喚。你代奴，送於西廂張相公。紅娘是，領了千金命。急匆匆，走出廻廊又轉東。走進竹籬門兩扇。但只見，園中花草色鮮紅。白芍藥海棠沿堦種。薔薇花巧靠竹屛風。又見　，十二闌干外。碧桃開放向牆東。玉蘭已綠　無日。老梅椿生得甚玲瓏。紅娘是，金蓮理動重行走。急忙忙走過小橋虹。又只見，橋邊一帶垂楊柳。橋上闌干硃漆紅。鴛鴦宿在荷池內。流水潺潺響可咚。他是，觀不盡園中景。要緊前去送書一封。行過禪林穿曲徑。見前頭，小小客堂造朝東。內邊擺設靈玉翠。精工雕刻實玲瓏。琴棋書畫兩榜掛。四色文章藏在書閣中。一付對聯分左右。後邊落欵，筆法允如王右軍。上聯是，風吹楊柳千條綫。下聯是，雨滴桃花遍地紅。中間掛一幅名人畫。畫的是，流水高山筆墨工。紫枟椅桌水摩滑。球燈兩傍錦屛風。父見那，張相公，氣呼呼眠在沉香榻。他是，輕言細語叫相公。相公呀我奉閨中千金命。特地前來送書一封。相公聽。咲溶溶。銀箋接去就開封。上寫着，崔氏鶯鶯女。百拜西廂君

<p>申報本埠附　汽車周刊汽車中裝置收音機者日衆  虞　　汽車中裝置無綫電收音機。在目下看起來已不成為一件希罕的事了。尤其在大都市裏。汽車車主常喜在車廂裹安置一架收音機。等到身子坐定。把機紐一撥。那空氣中的音樂歌曲。名人演講。以及商情及新聞報吿等。都一一的在耳際活躍着。當然，車主們裝置這種傳音機的本旨。無非在娛樂消遣。不過在另一方面。也有作為一種重要工具的。像大都市裹警務用的汽車。尤其是有武裝配備的。都裝有無錢電話收音機。隨時與總署交通消息。盜竊等案因而破獲的。為數很多。這種裝置就和普通客車中所裝的，在意義上却大不相同了。　　講到汽車上裝用無綫電收音機。在美國已經有十多年的歷史了。在一千九百二十二年的時候。一個住在伊利諾州奎恩舍地方的威廉利亞。他曾造過一具汽車上用的無錢電話收音機。賣給一個從卡華格地方來的醫生。那醫生駕了這　一輛裝有收音機的汽車。開到樂士安極立斯去。又從那里回返原地。可是他在這個長途行程中。雖曾撥動那盤鍵。結果是一無所得。後來纔發覺那機栓的地位弄錯了。在汽車公司中製造的收音機　。直到一九二七年方始上市。那時候落地式的大型收音機。在美國差不多已經家有一具了。這時汽車上用的收音機由一家小公司製造。每一天所造的數量很少。不過數十具而已。　　經過了三年的時期。汽車上裝用無錢電收音機的風氣漸漸地發達了。所以到了一九三〇年。無錢電收音機的銷數。一躍而到三四·〇〇〇具。翌年為一九三一年銷路格外廣大。比了一九三〇年增加至三倍。再兩年之後。銷數已達七二四·〇〇〇具之多了。因爲出品一多。售價便漸行减低。而大家向來看作為奢侈品的。到這時候也漸把那觀念打破了。越到後來。無綫電收音機的售價越發低跌。一九三五年時那銷路經高漲到近百萬具。所謂薄利多賣。貨多價跌那是一些也不錯的。　　因為汽車中裝置無綫電收音機的風氣。已經風起雲湧。成為一種極普遍的現象。於是各汽車製造公司。也就專門注意到這件事。尤其是幾家大廠。像通用公司等。格外的投客所好。從事大量製造。最近又收買了格羅斯萊無錢電公司的汽車無綫電部。那廠設在印第亞那州的古古木地方。並宣稱以後所有的通用汽車。祇要購車人略加零費。便把無綫電收音機視作必要零件的把它裝久每一輛出售的汽車中。因之汽車中裝用收音機。在最近的將來。顯然更將普遍了。通用汽車公司的從事於無綫電業。資格上也已有相當的歷史。在數年前。曾經造過家庭中用的無綫電收音機。不過在一九三三年時。那廠便閉歇了。　　目下無綫電收音機的裝置。在汽車製造業中。確已佔着相等的勢力。預計一九三六年中。這無綫電收音機的裝置於汽車中的。其數目將達二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇具。至於家庭中裝用的無錢電收音機。為數約在四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇具左右。今年的汽車產量。據可靠估計約為四·五〇〇·〇〇〇輛。因之每兩輛汽車中間。便將有一輛汽車裝置收音機。那情形又和裝置備胎一般的相去不遠哩。談新式之家庭拖車  雲　　喜珍奇。厭陳舊。殆為人之常情。但祗知享受新奇。而不能創造以適應新需要者。是亦不足以言進步者也。歐美人好動惡靜。追求無倦。往往推陳出新。其一種堅强之毅力。廻非徒作享受現成者所得而夢想。汽車之日新月異。機力式樣。精益求精。固無論已。卽拖曳汽車。現亦年有新製。各大廠不惜耗巨資作專門研究。車身製作。內部佈置。無不力求上乘。一經陳列。購者如秋塘鳧趨。轉瞬吿罄。迨其新貨續出。大衆又望眼欲穿。延頸以待之矣。家庭拖車之所以能得暢銷者。其最大原因。不外好奇好動心。譬如美國本為汽車出產之淵藪。舉目街市。鼓四輪而風馳電挈者汽車也。流綫滑潤。絢爛奪目。排比街角者又汽車也。一般人對於汽車之興味。宜由習見而入平淡矣。但事實上則不然。新型乍出。街巷已空。舊車棄如蔽帚。新車奉若上客。此好奇使然也。至其好動。則尤習性所關。浮槎載宅。陸地行舟。以汽車作遠遊者。不僅夏令為然。卽嚴冬風雪載途。亦有胃寒踏冰作千里游者。是則家庭拖曳汽車尙矣。今日美國人以汽車作住宅者。已非僅見。推其興發之由。一，輾轉自如。無遠弗屆也。美國公路如珠網。四通八達。路之所至。車卽因之。二，以車為家。無需屋租也。汽車之捐有執照者。來去自如。停宿整眠。一無干係。旣省納租之煩。又得週轉之樂。三，設備完美。經濟安全也。各車廠對於家庭拖曳車之製造。精究有加。令駕乘者有如歸樂。無他鄉愁。大至榻床箱籠。小至燈具碟架。應有盡有。使用便利。外觀整飭。無拖泥帶水之麻煩。有直截了當之痛快。以少勝多。以簡壓繁。是得經濟之眞旨者也。至安全一節。則製造廠方面。更能爲車主設身處地。所無不用其極。堅固之車架。夾層之金屬板。水力吸震。石棉避火。以及安全玻璃。彈簧鎖門等。雖處荒野。無異城居。風雨不侵。宵小難逞。其冬暖夏凉。疾馳如矢。猶其餘事也。四，售價日廉。普及較易也。物稀則貴。夥則賤。此常理耳。昔之拖曳車。以售價昂。非有特殊用途者不敢問津。今則中上之家。力能置汽車者，均可染指矣。故其普遍也易。而為用亦廣。綜此四點。家庭拖曳車之在美國。自得欣欣向榮。最近如的克之史勃力公司。出有新型之家庭式拖曳車兩種。雖名以伯仲為別。而使用則無分軒輊。如上圖所示。卽共外形。輕盈靜好。宜家宜室。秀外惠中。亦嗔亦喜。每車以滑門隔作兩室。能居二人至四人。絕無擁擠之虞。前室合起居，餐食，及睡臥各室爲一。後房的庖廚。有鍋爐水盆及冰箱等。除冰箱外。爐盆於不使用時。可覆以板。若桌然。一物二用。此祇其一端耳。與庖屋相毘連者爲化裝室。內有洗盥具及淋浴裝置。拖曳車與駕馳車之間。有電話為傳遞消息之工具。故雖處兩車。無異一室也。內部裝置各有不同。一視顧客之需要而定造。購車者亦多匠心獨運。標異之新者。惟其切實用，節糜費。則可謂如出一轍也。論其售價。如圖示者。大約為美金一千一百元左右。以措大聞之。或仍嫌其過昂耳。司蒂倍克獨有特色「山抓」之功用　　祗須用左足踏緊接合器蹬等於塞車儘可以右足踏加速蹬前進無慮倒車頃據各國司蒂倍克汽車經售商報吿。一般車主　對於一九三六年式新司蒂倍克之獨有特色自動「山抓」Hill-Holder。以共功用宏偉。確大有裨於駕駛操縱。故無不同聲讚美。極表滿意。按此項新裝置。惟司蒂倍克車上有之。斯蓋如其餘種種機械裝置然。司蒂倍克首先發明以後。整個汽車業。不久卽皆仿而行之焉。　　本埠司蒂倍克經售商。大夏汽車公司。樣子間設於麥特赫司脫路二七一號。其經理徐君。近除對於此種新特色自動山抓。作詳盡之解釋外。並曾當塲表演。以證明其功用。據徐君云。自動山抓。為汽車業從未有過。亦卽汽車界人士從未應用之一種新裝置。自發明以後。向所認為無法解决之難題。因而得以圓滿解决。而汽車界人士。一經應用此種裝置。亦遂熱烈需要。而公認為不可或缺焉。按當汽車停於高坡之上。而欲復行上駛之際。吾人曾作除原有兩足外願更有一足以供應用之幻想者。蓋已不知若干决矣。良以停車之時。須以右足踏車制。而左足則踏接合器上。故於放鬆接合器與車制時。兩足並用。不遑他顧。此吾人所以殷願另有一足。以便加諸加速器上也。蓋斯時舉動一不留意。車卽向後滑溜而下。或者竟與後車互撞而肇禍。如保險槓及擋泥板損壤以及傷人等情事。狀此種種。非所語於新司蒂克汽車也。司蒂倍克新車所裝配之山抓。自動工作。效用彌宏。如君於上山時。右足踏下車制以使車停。左足踏接合器蹬。則此種自動山抓。遂卽發揮其功用。蓋當左足踏緊接合器蹬不放。君車卽可始終屹立不移。卽右足離開制動蹬以後。車身亦無向後滑溜之危險。於是右足儘可自由加諸加速器上。以便復行駕車上駛焉。　　按駛登高坡。原非易事。故雖男駕駛員。亦皆謹愼從事。母敢怠忽。若女駕駛員。自史無論矣。今司蒂倍克之自動山抓。功用若斯之敏妙而可靠。且係出於自動。宜其尤爲女界所歡迎也。徐君並稱滬市各處罹　。尤為交通危險區域。汽車行經斯處。其駕駛操縱。實有絕對得心應手之必要。方可保萬無一失。今則司蒂倍克新車。獨有自動山抓之裝置。此其所以尤為安全可靠也。煞車所經歷的時間  何之　　當我們行駛汽車。突然發現前面有危險或障碍時。心內早能明白要立刻煞車。制止汽車前進。但事實上往往不能如願。甚至手足一時不能措置。這種困難。稍習駕駛汽車的。總可以感覺到。單就人們生理上來說。由眼睛看到危險景像。視覺神經傳遞到腦神經中樞。腦神經因得到報吿而起反應。於是傳令於手足。使足尖離開增速率踏板。而踏上制動器踏板。去制止汽車行進。故由看到危險而煞車。其間須經過許多手續。雖腦神經傳達意見很迅速。但一運串的事情。依决序地傳遞着。不是不需要刹那間的時間咧。故美國蜜立沙泰市公用局着手做試騐。求出由視到危險而煞車所經歷的最少時間。　　該局聘用皮第勞氏駕駛汽車。皮氏是駕駛汽車的名手。他曾得到一九三五年美國汽車賽駛首獎。各種駕駛動作。當屬嫻熟。但據試騐的結果。由皮氏看到危險。而後把足尖移上制動器踏板時。其間也需經過半秒以上。這個試騐的方法。　科皮第　　　汽車　某　　　路上兜圈子。若看到紅　燈上公路。汽車便須停駛。車內除皮氏外。還有兩個人。坐在旁邊。一個看前面若發現紅布時。立刻向窗外放槍。另外一個人。則等皮氏的足尖踏上制動器踏根。立刻也放一彈。結果。去量兩彈的距離。據皮氏汽車行駛速度有每小時三十六英里。突然看到紅布拋上道路而煞車。則兩彈距離有二十五英呎之處。由汽車那時候行進速度上。便可算出。其間所經歷的時問。在半秒鐘以上。由此可證明遇險而煞車。必需經過相當的時間。一週間汽車肇禍記  三原　　本週間之汽車肇禍。共有七起。內因重傷身死者。計男子一人。男孩一名。重傷者。計　　　　　屬傷者。　男子七人云。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the Guangdong army retreated and gathered in Chenzhou, the tense situation at the front gradually eased. At the same time, the Guangxi army also halted its advance in Yongqi. There are not many Guangdong troops on the Fujian border, and the Guangdong troops sent to the Jiangxi border have not been active. The Central Committee members in Nanjing have been telegraphing the Central Committee members in Guangdong and Guangxi for days, urging them to thoroughly understand the situation, withdraw their troops, and return to their original defenses to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing to discuss everything. Most of the Central Committee members in Guangdong and Guangxi do not approve of unilateral military action and are working hard to eliminate the movement. The social and financial situation in Guangdong and Guangxi is extremely chaotic. Even if strict measures are taken to deal with speculation, it cannot be stopped. Rice and commodity prices have soared more than doubled. Liu Luyin, a Central Committee member staying in Guangdong, is scheduled to leave for the north this week, accompanied by Cheng Tiangu and others. Li Wenfan is still staying in Nanjing, working hard for the situation. The number of committee members from Guangdong and Guangxi attending the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee who are coming north has not yet been fully determined.

Your generosity and passion deeply inspire us. All of our countrymen share your feelings. I, Shan, am deeply pained by the remaining years of the anti-Japanese war and admire you especially. However, the people of the country are saddened by the civil war. Planning for the country must be based on complete certainty, and national salvation must be achieved with the unity of the whole country. It is absolutely impermissible to engage in a tragic slaughter and fall into the enemy's conspiracy of division and slaughter. Please rein in your horse at the precipice and do not hasten your own demise. The nation has reached this point of crisis and we should all cry together." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Islamic Youth Association telegraphed Bai Chongxi, saying that he is a follower of the Prophet Muhammad and a pioneer in the religion, and should uphold the spirit of republicanism and peace, preserve his past honor, turn hostility into friendship, rein in his horse at the precipice, preserve a glimmer of vitality for the country, sacrifice prejudices, unite in spirit, and quickly withdraw the troops stationed in Hunan to stop the internal strife.

It is reported that the participants in these negotiations include Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi, and He Jian, Pacification Commissioner of Hunan. It is reported that the price the Guangxi representatives are demanding for peace seems to be an obstacle to compromise, but efforts are being made to bring them to compliance. It is reported that He Jian will issue a proclamation to appease the people. Although the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have withdrawn from Yongzhou to the border, there are still several Guangxi divisions digging trenches for defense between Yongzhou and Qiyang. As the outcome of the negotiations in Hengzhou is uncertain, the overall situation still seems unclear. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the newspapers today did not have any criticism of the overall situation in China, they are still paying attention to all news about the current crisis in China. The start of negotiations between Ning and Gui has created a good impression among people here. The newspapers had previously predicted that China would not have a civil war. The price of Chinese bonds had a turnaround yesterday and is stabilizing again today, with signs of rising. The Chinese community in London has never despaired of the overall situation in China. At the same time, the newspapers are also paying attention to the situation of smuggling in eastern Hebei. There is much speculation about the results of the visit to Japan by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the economic advisor to the British government. Japan is now clearly preparing to discuss the overall situation in China with the Sir, which is very different from his first visit to Japan when he was rebuffed, so everyone is hopeful about this. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable Chinese sources, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi's representative, Pan Yizhi, has secretly arrived here.

<h3 id="e12">A New Development in the North China Crisis <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The situation in North China has never been calm, especially when changes occur domestically. The crisis in North China is progressing at an accelerated pace. Those who seek to harm us are fully utilizing the opportunity of the shift in the eyes of our people, using it as cover for their advance and intensifying the implementation of their consistent expansionist policy. Everything military, political, and economic is being actively arranged. Recently, large numbers of foreign troops have been deployed to the areas around Beiping and Tianjin. At the same time, Fengtai, the intersection of the Beiping-Hankou, Beiping-Suiyuan, and Beining lines, is also being enclosed for the construction of airfields and barracks. At the same time, Yin Rugeng is also setting up an arsenal in Tongzhou. These are all clear signs that they are making further military controls. The political seizures are also very obvious. The pressure on the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has reached its final stage. In addition, the increasingly rampant smuggling, the imminent establishment of a "new tariff system," and the active development of resources are all evolutions of economic centrifugality in North China.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reality is not limited to this. These are only partial depictions of the area around Beiping and Tianjin. At present, the crises in Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Shandong are no less serious than those in Beiping and Tianjin, and the situation in Inner Mongolia is particularly evident. According to a China United Press dispatch on the 7th, "The number of Japanese in Inner Mongolia has recently surged to more than 6,000. These Japanese, nominally engaged in business and running schools, are actually contacting Mongolians and instigating 'autonomy.' More than 30 Japanese advisors at Prince De's residence are inseparable from Prince De day and night." It can be seen that the situation is serious. Another example is the recent rumor that Zhang Zuoyi visited Yan Xishan to discuss important issues in Suiyuan. Although the results of their talks are not yet clear, they reflect the unfavorable situation in Suiyuan to some extent. As the "Millard's Review" said, not only Beiping and Tianjin, but also Chahar and Suiyuan are worrying enough.</p>
<p>The new Japanese ambassador, Shigeru Kawagoe, has come to China with "instructions." It is said that the instructions he carries will not change the so-called "Hirota Three Principles." London political circles had predicted that Japan would adopt military action against China again this summer, and key figures in the Japanese military in China are holding a cadre meeting in Tianjin. From these connections, it can be known that the future situation is difficult to imagine. At a time when the country is facing such a dangerous juncture, what internal disputes cannot be resolved? What personal grudges cannot be tolerated?</p>
<h3 id="e13">British Foreign Secretary Answers Question, If China and Japan Go to War, Appropriate Measures Will be Taken <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Protect the Focal Points of British Interests, Add Troops to the Shanghai Concession to Prevent Being Affected</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting today, members of parliament asked about the impact of smuggling in North China on British trade in China, the status of the Shanghai International Settlement if China and Japan go to war, and the attitude of the British government towards the "Autonomous Government" of Eastern Hebei. Labor Party MP Mr. Davis asked whether any British or Indian troops or warships from Hong Kong had been transferred to Shanghai, what kind of instructions the British government had issued, and whether the Shanghai International Settlement would refuse to allow the armies of belligerent countries to enter if China and Japan went to war, or would it continue to follow the precedent (1932) of only refusing Chinese troops. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the authorities had taken the usual plan to protect the focal points of British interests in the current turbulent areas, such as preparing a large brigade of reinforcements in Hong Kong to send to Shanghai to strengthen the British garrison there, and preparing a plan to dispatch a detachment of the British fleet stationed in China to the affected ports in an emergency. He did not want to answer based on questions about the fantasy of a Sino-Japanese war. What he could say was that the authorities intended to make every effort to keep the Shanghai International Settlement free from all wars. Conservative Party MP Mr. Molson asked about the harm to British trade in Shanghai, Hankou, and the Yangtze River basin caused by competition from smuggled goods entering North China from Eastern Hebei. Captain Wallace of the Overseas Trade Department of the Board of Trade replied that he had received a report from the British Commercial Counselor in Shanghai comparing the customs figures for the first four months of 1936 with the same period in 1935. In general, the book showed that the direct impact of smuggling on British trade so far was not significant, because most of the smuggled goods were not of the type made by Britain. However, the authorities are now closely monitoring the situation of smuggling. Conservative Party MP Mr. Morgan asked whether the British government now recognizes Eastern Hebei as an autonomous region and whether the Chinese customs are still serving in the area. The Foreign Secretary replied that Eastern Hebei is part of Chinese territory, so the British government still regards it as being under the jurisdiction of the Central Government. There has been no change in the status of customs recently. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Japanese Ambassador Comes to China to Assume His New Post, Promote Economic Policies, Build the Cangshi Road and Develop the Resources of North China, and Start Diplomatic Negotiations After Assuming Office <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Kawagoe has received instructions from Foreign Minister Arita to begin activities based on the fundamental policy of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in order to open up Sino-Japanese relations. The economic assistance currently being implemented includes economic and technical assistance for cotton cultivation and the development of mines such as coal and iron. Therefore, full effort must be put into building railways in North China in the future. Japan will provide construction materials so that the Chinese government can allocate part of its military and administrative expenses. Ambassador Kawagoe plans to begin negotiations with the Chinese authorities immediately after taking office, starting with the Cangshi Railway. The Japanese government, in view of Frederick Leith-Ross's activities, is actively implementing economic assistance to North China, which is quite noteworthy. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Kawagoe left Tokyo at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th to take office. Foreign Minister Arita specially invited Kawagoe to the Foreign Minister's official residence at 4:00 p.m. on the 15th, gave him the final instructions on the China policy, and exchanged important opinions on specific methods of economic assistance for one and a half hours. At present, the Chinese political situation is eventful, and the substantial resolution of political issues between China and Japan is truly difficult. The Foreign Minister instructed the Ambassador to temporarily observe the Chinese political situation quietly and begin political negotiations after the situation stabilizes. However, assistance with economic issues can help restore China's economy and create a foundation for Sino-Japanese political negotiations. It was decided to implement economic assistance in North China and gradually extend it to the entire territory of China. The British and Japanese joint assistance advocated by Frederick Leith-Ross is only beneficial to a part of the regime and cannot be expected to have any productive effect. Foreign Minister Arita rejected Ross's proposal because the military also recognized that Ross's proposal to invest in Central and South China was inappropriate. The Japanese Army, Navy, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs believe that North China has close ties with Japan and that economic assistance to North China can stabilize Chinese politics and create a goal of production development. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Yokohama The new Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, and his wife left Tokyo Station at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th to take up their posts, and many officials and civilians went to the station to see them off. On the train, he first said that there is a possibility of cooperation between China and Japan, and he hoped to gradually realize the construction of the foundation for friendship between the two countries. Then he issued a statement in separate articles as follows:</p>
<p>General Coordination Policy When the political stability of China has not been achieved, the fundamental principle of providing economic assistance cannot naturally be established. Therefore, the political prevention of the misfortune of the Chinese people, I intend to also be a method of realizing political stability.</p>
<p>Economic Assistance to North China In this sense, the realization of Japanese economic assistance in North China, a special zone between Japan and "Manchukuo," is the first step. The railway loans, rural cooperation and guidance, and mineral exploration and development with on-the-spot investment in North China are all prerequisite problems. We are willing to fully bear the burden of anything that is unprofitable, and we hope to enable the private sector to obtain benefits and promote Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding Smuggling in North China The Chinese government should first express its determination to drastically reduce tax rates and eliminate the internal causes of smuggling. If so, the Japanese government can also strive to stop smuggling within the possible range.</p>
<p>The relations between China, Britain, and the Soviet Union in China are quite complicated, but the relationship between China and Japan is a matter of life and death for both countries and is naturally different from the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union. This is what all countries should pay attention to. If the Japanese side does not harm Japan's interests in China and can benefit China, then the cooperation between Britain and Japan in China will definitely not be rejected.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ambassador will hold talks with the Kansai business community to encourage economic cooperation in the private sector. He is scheduled to depart from Kobe on the Asama Maru on the 20th, arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd, and present his credentials in Nanjing at the end of the month.

<p>Rumors in North China Are Groundless</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsumuro Takayoshi stated: "Recently, there have been many rumors circulating about North China, all of which are unfounded. Given the current situation in North China, I sincerely hope that the Hebei and Chahar authorities will make every effort to save the nation and its people as soon as possible. The diplomatic relations between Hebei and Chahar, which I have been handling in Beiping, have come to a standstill due to the lack of concrete results. As for the resignation of Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying, the Japanese side hopes that the Hebei and Chahar authorities will carefully select his successor. According to Hamada, an assistant at Matsumuro's office, Military Attaché Imai went to Shanghai to meet with Kita and is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow evening, staying briefly before returning to Beiping. Sugimoto, the former Vice Chief of Staff, left Beiping yesterday for Zhangjiakou and then flew to Chengde for inspection. The Japanese military barracks in Fengtai are currently under active construction, and upon completion, some troops will be transferred there to garrison." (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When interviewed by reporters from the Hua Bao today, Matsumuro Takayoshi, Advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, stated that Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying could no longer return to his post. Regarding the vacancy, the Japanese authorities have no objection to Zhang Zizhong, the current Chairman of Chahar, succeeding him. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 2,100 men of the 228th Regiment of the 38th Division of Zhang Zizhong's troops, originally stationed in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua on the Ping-Sui Railway Line in Chahar Province, as well as 700 infantrymen from a special detachment, totaling 3,000 men, have recently moved to the area between Beiping and Tianjin. From 2:00 AM on the 14th until dusk, they arrived at Yongdingmen, the south gate of Beiping, and entered the Nanyuan Barracks. This is a preliminary move by the Hebei-Chahar side, after the resignation of Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying, the focal point of the North China problem, to have Zhang Zizhong of the 29th Army's direct lineage succeed him.

<p>(Nanjing) The situation of Japanese military police in Tianjin shielding rōnin who forcibly transport smuggled goods is becoming increasingly serious. It has recently been learned that ten cars of tax-evaded white sugar were transported from Tianjin Main Station to Jinan via the East Station on the 13th. Fifteen Japanese and Korean people, carrying weapons, forcibly boarded the guard car to escort the goods. The station master dispatched personnel to notify the Japanese military police to stop them. They claimed that if the main station could guarantee that the freight cars would arrive in Jinan without being inspected or seized and provide a written guarantee, they could stop them; otherwise, it would be inconvenient to intervene. They added that if the sugar was not shipped out today and an accident happened to the Japanese and Korean, the railway would be responsible. The Japanese and Korean were extremely rude, and the customs officers at the station were unable to stop them. The station master was also forced to arrange for the shipment. Large quantities of smuggled sugar have been transported from Beining to Jinan via joint transport for several days. The Tianjin Main Station, forced by the circumstances due to the Japanese and Koreans carrying weapons and being shielded by the Japanese military police, had no choice but to arrange for the shipment. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. Furthermore, the Bengbu Freight Depot seized a total of 262 tons and 500 kilograms of smuggled sugar transported from Tianjin East Station from May 18th to 24th, which has been taken over and handled by the Jinling Customs. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e37">US Democratic Party Platform Unconditionally Supports Bimetallism; National Convention Scheduled for Next Week <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Thomas, a member of the party's platform drafting committee, told the Associated Press today that the Democratic Party's national convention, scheduled to be held in Philadelphia next week, will pass a platform that unconditionally supports bimetallism, which is completely different from the Republican Party's platform. Thomas also said that judging from the telegram sent by Republican presidential candidate Landon, Governor of Kansas, to the Republican convention, Landon did not understand the currency issue at all. He thought that the Republican platform had won the hearts of the western states. As for the platform to be submitted to the Democratic Party convention, it briefly stated: "The Democratic Party should advocate a stable currency and use both gold and silver as monetary standards. To achieve currency stability, appropriate measures must be taken, and its value must be adequate and appropriate. The current Democratic government provides the United States with this kind of currency, so the US dollar is also the most stable currency in the world." Thomas said that his only dissatisfaction with President Roosevelt's currency policy was his failure to reduce the ratio of the domestic value of the US dollar to domestic prices as much as possible, resulting in the domestic value of the US dollar being different from its foreign value. "I support maintaining the current foreign price, but the domestic price should be slightly lowered to slightly increase domestic prices." (15th Guomin Dian)</p>
<p>(Washington) Silver faction leader Pittman declared today that the Republican Party's platform showed no signs of attack or criticism on currency and silver matters, so this issue will not become a target of the election. Pittman also said that the United States is always ready to stabilize its currency, but the United Kingdom should also take action in this regard, because currency stability is also extremely needed in Britain.

<p>(London) When the International Peace Conference opened in Cardiff today, King Edward's message was read out, hoping that the conference could promote international peace. This was what the late King George valued, and he himself was very concerned about it. When Councillor MacDonald spoke, he read a letter from Foreign Secretary Eden, saying that it is now necessary to make the desire for individuals to live in peace a part of every nation's conscience, and only then can international peace be preserved.

<h3 id="e40">Abolishing Sanctions Against Italy; Britain's Attitude Has Been Decided; Three Reasons Have Been Found; The League of Nations Covenant Must Also Be Amended; The Cabinet Officially Decided Today <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is now believed that the British Cabinet has, in principle, agreed to stop sanctions against Italy. If the League of Nations resolves to lift sanctions, the British government will also follow suit. It is heard that this decision is based on three reasons:  Sanctions have failed; Continuing to implement them is useless; The European situation now requires placing relations with Italy in a new position. The final decision on this issue will be made at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. It is expected that the House of Commons will hold a foreign policy debate on that day, at which the government's foreign policy will be announced.</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Committee met last night, and all important cabinet members attended. It is heard that they considered the sanctions policy and the issue of Turkey's request to establish defenses in the Dardanelles Strait, which will be discussed at a meeting in Montreux, Switzerland on the 1st of next week. It is heard that First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Hoare will be the chief British representative attending the meeting.</p>
<p>Last night, seven or eighty members of the Conservative Party's private committee held a meeting in the House of Commons. Many speakers unanimously advocated for the abolition of sanctions as soon as possible, and said that the League of Nations Covenant should now be amended, especially the articles on sanctions, and that the League of Nations' unlimited responsibilities should be terminated.

<p>(London) The development of the issue of sanctions against Italy yesterday took a sharp turn. The House of Commons had decided to discuss foreign policy on the 18th of this month, and the Conservative Party's "backbench committee" held a meeting in the House of Commons, expressing its approval of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's previously announced proposal to lift sanctions against Italy. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee also met late at night and decided on the outline of the declaration that the Cabinet should make in the House of Commons. Political activities were so intense, which shows that British public opinion has attached great importance to the Cabinet's need to determine its position. Among the cabinet members, almost all are in favor of lifting the sanctions, and even if there are differences, they are only in the timing. As for Foreign Secretary Eden, although he is a supporter of the sanctions policy, he has also decided to support the views of other cabinet members and will not contend with resignation. It is generally expected that Prime Minister Baldwin will definitely deliver a speech at the House of Commons meeting on Thursday, declaring that the Cabinet is already prepared to relax the sanctions measures. At that time, Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, will demand that the House of Commons designate a day in the coming week to discuss the impeachment of the Cabinet. (16th Havas Dian)</p>
<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting today, Labour MP Henderson asked Foreign Secretary Eden, "Italy has openly violated the Paris Pact. What repercussions will this action have on the policies of Britain and other signatory countries?" Foreign Secretary Eden replied, "This issue is indeed one that should be handled by the signatory countries to the pact, but the pact does not explicitly stipulate what actions other signatory countries should take if one of the signatory countries violates the pact. This is what I should declare." Henderson retorted, "The preamble to the Paris Pact clearly stipulates that any signatory country that violates the obligations of this pact shall not enjoy the benefits conferred by this pact. I believe the Foreign Secretary is aware of this. If so, then action should be taken in a timely manner to maintain the dignity of the pact and not let it become a mere scrap of paper, so as to avoid causing tragedy." Foreign Secretary Eden then said that he was familiar with the content of the preamble to the Paris Pact and requested that Henderson submit the matter in writing so that the government could consider it and respond. (15th Havas Dian)</p>
<p>(London) There is no doubt that the British government is about to propose the lifting of sanctions against Italy. The newspapers are now commenting on the differences of opinion within the cabinet and the rumors of Foreign Secretary Eden's resignation. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle reported that once the current sanctions measures are lifted, the obligations that the British government should bear on the Rhine and in the Mediterranean can be determined, and the obligations that it should bear elsewhere in Europe can be abandoned. The Daily Mail reported that there was no difference of opinion within the cabinet on the issue of lifting sanctions. The British government has always supported the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and naturally bears no responsibility for the failure of the League of Nations. "For the current plan, the extent of the military obligations that the countries concerned can bear should be determined. In other words, it must be clearly specified in which areas the countries concerned are prepared to fight." (16th Havas Dian)</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper delivered a speech at a banquet, advocating for military buildup to defend the country, and fiercely criticizing the attitude of pacifists, saying, "The current situation in Europe is worse than before the outbreak of the European War in 1914. All those who know the truth of the situation acknowledge this. The remarks made by pacifists in public are enough to poison public opinion. Their danger is worse than that of suffocating gas. Some may say that we should not be alarmist and scare the people, but I believe that all those in power have the obligation to awaken the masses from their illusions. In the summer of 1914, before the outbreak of the European War, people of insight loudly warned the public, and I still remember their words vividly. The current situation is fraught with crises, even more so than at that time. Shouldn't I make this appeal?" In conclusion, he firmly advocated that Britain should have full military preparations to serve as the country's shield, saying, "In London alone, for the defense against sky raids, there must be an army of 10,000 men. It seems that even pacifists recognize that it is appropriate for the government to make various air defense preparations to protect the residents of the capital, but those people are now strongly劝青有为之士母向本部陆军防空队投效劝 dissuading promising young people from joining the Air Defense Force of the Army Headquarters.

<p>(Vienna) An official newspaper published an article stating that the Austrian people's desire for restoration is growing, all hoping that Archduke Otto will return home and ascend the throne. However, it is believed that the monarchy will be restored by decisive means, only hinting that the government may hold a referendum to resolve the issue. Political circles here were shocked after seeing this article, believing it to be the most important official declaration on the issue since the war. Although the Little Entente (Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia) recently threatened to oppose this move, judging from the current situation, the authorities are determined to proceed. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) It is now believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is secretly supporting the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria. According to well-informed sources, Mussolini recently met with Austrian Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg in Italy and told him that he was willing to act as an intermediary between the Austrian government, moderate Austrians, and the German National Socialist Party. Italy will maintain Austria's independence, but the tense situation between Vienna and Berlin must be eased quickly. It is widely believed that Mussolini's actions are part of a new Central European joint movement, hoping to eliminate Germany's threat to the Brenner Pass (the main road from Germany to Italy), so that Italy can negotiate more freely with France and England. A key figure from the orthodox faction told a reporter today that after the restoration, the Austrian government will issue a statement to the Little Entente countries stating that Austria does not intend to recover lost territories, thereby reassuring the three countries, and will seek economic and political friendship with Germany. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After Chancellor Schuschnigg ordered the dissolution of various paramilitary groups on the 14th of last month and personally took over the Patriotic Front, the members of the Home Guard have now decided to join the Patriotic Front. The Home Guard was originally led by former Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg. (Havas, 16th)</p>

The International Labor Office will consider it, but the date of the meeting is difficult to predict. Once the time is right, it will be actively pursued. In addition, it is the first time that a Soviet Russian labor representative has attended the International Labor Conference, which shows that the relationship between the International Labor Office and the Soviet Union is becoming closer.

Employers in all industries in Japan sincerely desire the happiness of workers, just like employers in European countries. Due to overpopulation in Japan, it is not easy for people to find work. In addition, countries are adopting protectionist tariff policies, and most markets are largely closed to Japanese goods. The recent aggravation of labor problems in Japan is due to this. In conclusion, he stated that employers in all industries in Japan are willing to cooperate with the International Labor Conference, but free trade is essential for Japan and must be restored. Subsequently, the Japanese government representative, Toshiitsu Kitaoka, gave a speech, stating that he shared the same view as the Director of the International Labor Office, Harold Butler, that the current tariffs in various countries must be reduced. He also stated that after Japanese goods can be sold freely, social conditions in Japan will be easier to improve. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem. Terrorists are still rampant in Palestine. Despite the government's various efforts to curb them, they have not been effective. Sniper attacks and bombings occurred throughout the country today. This morning, rioters fired shots at the civilian airfield here and set fire to a cargo plane. The wireless station in Ramallah, nine miles northwest of here, was also attacked by snipers. Near Kalkilya, someone bombed a railway, destroying tracks and telephone lines. However, the tracks were repaired immediately, and trains were not delayed. The Arab mayor and city councilors of Jaffa resigned today.

<p>(London) The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" received a report from Palestine yesterday claiming that the late Colonel Lawrence (a famous British spy who engaged in activities in Arab territories during the European War, achieving remarkable achievements, hence the title "uncrowned king of Arabia") had altered the agreement signed by the Jewish and Arab communities on January 3, 1919, to prove that the Arab chieftain Faisal (later promoted to King of Iraq, died in 1933) expressed his support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This agreement was written in English and Arabic. Faisal, not being proficient in English, added a note in Arabic to the English version, stating that the Jewish people could establish a homeland in Palestine, but only on the precondition of the establishment of an Arab empire. However, Colonel Lawrence believed that after the establishment of a Jewish homeland, the Arab empire that they desired could follow. Therefore, he reduced the meaning of this condition. Up to now, due to Jewish immigration, the Arab community has clashed with the Jewish community, and emotions are very tense. Regarding this agreement, the Arab community not only accuses the English version of not conforming to the original meaning, but also claims that the entire text was fabricated by the Jewish community.

<p>(London) Londoners were greatly disappointed after Ruttledge's attempt to conquer Kanchenjunga, the highest peak in the world, failed. The peak is "the roof of the world," rising 29,140 feet above sea level. This marks the fifth failure. The cause of the failure was due to strong seasonal winds. According to weather reports, it is impossible to proceed along the old route. This is evidenced by the fact that the advance team of the expedition recently attempted to climb to Camp IV at 21,500 feet, but was suddenly blocked by an avalanche halfway up the mountain. The previous attempts to climb this highest peak were in 1921, 1924, and 1933, but each time they failed due to exhaustion in the last 2,000 feet. The air above is thin, and every step requires five deep breaths. The heavy oxygen equipment that they carry hinders progress. One thing that the expedition paid special attention to this year was the physical strength of the team members. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>The Rumor of the Change of Tianjin Mayor Has Passed</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying Passively Involved in Diplomacy; Will Return to His Post After the Atmosphere Calms Down</p>
<p>Another Meeting at the Japanese Headquarters</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Xiao Zhenying recently felt it difficult to cope with diplomatic relations and misunderstandings among some powerful factions in the 29th Army. He suddenly had the intention to resign, took his family to Peiping for more than ten days, and lived in seclusion in the Western Hills. Except for occasionally responding to Song Zheyuan's call to meet at the Summer Palace, he still expressed his firm intention to resign to Qin Decun, Feng Zhi'an, and other representatives sent by Song. The powerful factions have recently realized their previous actions and mistakenly believed in rumors. Middlemen caused discord. They have abandoned their prejudices and are striving for internal unity to urge Xiao to return to Tianjin to take charge to avoid the proliferation of rumors and affect the overall situation. If Xiao insists on resigning, then everyone will leave Hebei and Chahar together. Song also summoned Xiao to talk and showed him this intention. Therefore, although the atmosphere of Xiao's resignation has not calmed down, the fact has almost passed. In terms of diplomacy, Xiao's personal opinions conflicted with a certain staff officer of the stationed army. This staff officer had a narrow-minded outlook, harmed the public for personal reasons, and wanted Xiao to leave his post. Only this person was quite dissatisfied with the commander of the stationed army, fearing that his political views would hinder long-term plans. He has asked the military to transfer him. On the eighth of next month, the staff officer will return to his country, fearing that he will be transferred to another position and will not return to his post. When the atmosphere is a little calmer, Xiao may return to Tianjin to take office. However, the staff officer intends to cause trouble and is vigorously creating a new political power in North China, wanting to direct it before he leaves China. If it succeeds, it will be a great achievement and he will receive a generous reward upon return. If it fails, his personal grudges will be avenged and his mood will be calm. Therefore, various organizations of various colors have sprung up in a certain concession recently and are playing their roles. Although Xiao has not returned to Tianjin, Shi Jiesheng, the secretary-general of the municipal government, went to Peiping on the 14th to ask for instructions and obtained a concrete plan. He returned to Tianjin that night and discussed with Sun Weidong, the director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, and Liu Jiaying, the commander of the security forces, to further strengthen precautions. From Hai Xia Xian Shuigou to Yangliuqing in southern Tianjin, the naval, land, army, and police officers take turns patrolling day and night to prevent unexpected events. According to the security authorities on the 15th, the pseudo-organization in a certain concession is gathering a group of rabble and will never succeed. Because the military and police are closely equipped, they have already been discouraged. In a few days, seeing that there is no opportunity to take advantage of, they will naturally disappear and die out.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, Hamada, attached to the Japanese garrison headquarters, came to Tianjin from Peiping to visit Commander Tashiro and reported the results of his visit and talks with Chairman Song Zheyuan. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Nagami, convened all the staff members of the Headquarters, all those above the rank of major, to participate in a meeting called the Young Officers' Conference. The senior staff officers Iida, Ishii, staff officers Hayashi, Nakai, Ikeda, attached member Hamada, adjutant Kawada, and more than 30 other people discussed the situation in North China in detail. It was decided that ① the current situation of the Hebei-Chahar regime and the Eastern Hebei regime will be maintained. The issue of merging and abolishing them will not be discussed for the time being, and no overall changes will be sought. ② Attention will be paid to monitoring the attitude of the Southwest. If the opportunity comes, the clarification of the North China regime will be promoted to carry out what the military believes. In addition, there were several other proposals. After the meeting at 4:00 PM, Hamada returned to Peiping to convey the message to Matsumuro. The meeting of the Japanese Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army had not been formally held because the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Itagaki, had not arrived. Itagaki must visit President Matsuoka in Dalian with the two staff officers, Hanatani and Senta. He can arrive in Tianjin on the morning of the 19th. To avoid foreign attention, the meeting of military officers will not be expanded. The main members of the staff group of the two military departments will hold consultations, and then convey the message to all the military officers. Matsumuro and the commander of the stationed brigade in Peiping, Kawabe, must come to Tianjin on the 23rd to listen to the decision. (15th)</p>
<p>Northeast Soybean Exports Surge</p>
<p>Statistics for Last Month</p>
<p>Dalian Communication: The exports of Northeast soybeans from Dalian Port last month surged due to the peak season for fertilizer application during spring plowing in Japan and Taiwan, and the establishment of a trade agreement with Germany, which led to a surge in soybean prices, showing a rare high price in recent years. The Japanese believe that this was promoted by their high level of management and are very proud of it. The total export volume reached 47,074.5 metric tons, an increase of 3,051 metric tons compared to the same month last year, an increase of 94%. Among them, Baolong and Yifa He increased compared to last year, while others decreased, especially Mitsui and Mitsubishi. The statistics of the south-bound cargo are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Reclamation and Afforestation in Xiangyang</p>
<p>Xiangyang has a vast territory and abundant resources and is a wealthy area in northern Hubei. However, it has been ravaged by bandits for several years. White bones are scattered across the wilderness, foxes and rabbits chase people, houses have been turned into ruins, and fertile fields have become overgrown with weeds. The once fertile area has become a ghost town. Therefore, the amount of barren mountains and wasteland in Xiangyang is the highest in the entire province. After the bandit troubles were quelled and order was gradually restored, the issue of recruiting farmers to reclaim wasteland became the focus of attention from all parties. Organizations such as the "Reclamation Affairs Committee," "Wasteland Management Office," "Experimental Farm," "Agricultural Experimental School," and "Agricultural Extension Area" and "Rural Construction Experimental Area" have emerged one after another. Reclamation and afforestation have been carried out in parallel, and some progress has been made in the past two years. The reporter believes that this kind of undertaking is the foundation for rural revitalization and has great research value, so he conducted on-the-spot investigations or detailed investigations. After several days of effort, he finally learned the general situation. The northern area of Xiangyang borders Henan, and the customs of the people are used to being strong. Clashes often occur among large families. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, communist bandits and local bandits rose up together. Large families colluded with bandits and slaughtered each other. At first, they wanted to satisfy their momentary intentions, but in the end, they became uncontrollable. Two-thirds of the population was killed, and one-third fled. Villages in the areas of Luyan Post Station, Li Pai Gou, Daying, Wangjiawa, Raojiawa, Yejia Dian, Qiaowa, Honglingpu, Yingli Wangjia, Xiaomajia, Jin Wangjia, Sui Li Jia, Taojiawa, Youfang Township, Xia Liujia, Shaojiachong, and Stone Mason Zhangjia, spanning dozens of miles, were deserted, and more than 300,000 mu of land were barren. Thorns became forests, and artemisia engulfed the houses. Wild rabbits came out and devoured people. In the 21st year, the bandit troubles gradually subsided. Xiangyang established an administrative inspectorate area. The commissioner, Liu Ji, first initiated the reclamation of wasteland, but it was not realized. The following winter, the successor commissioner, Li Jianai, took over the seal and inherited his ambition. He invited local military, political, county officials, and gentry to form a reclamation affairs committee, dividing 180,000 mu of land in Luyan Post Station into the first reclamation area, and Qinghedian, Xuejiaji, Shuang Gou, and Dongjinwan into the second, third, fourth, and fifth reclamation areas, totaling 370,000 or 80,000 mu of wasteland. However, reclamation requires a large amount of money for houses, farm tools, cattle, seeds, and fertilizers in addition to labor. The first reclamation area alone requires 75,000 yuan, which is difficult to open up at the same time. Therefore, it was decided to reclaim the area around Luyan Post Station first, and it was approved to issue 25,000 yuan of reclamation bonds. In addition, Chairman Jiang ordered the Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces to assist in the process. After the bank sent personnel to investigate, it was decided to jointly establish a reclamation management office with the reclamation affairs committee. The reclamation committee allocated 25,000 yuan to purchase cattle and farm tools, and the agricultural bank allocated 50,000 yuan to provide loans. From June of the 23rd year, a two-year contract was signed. The management office was first established in the city, and soon moved to Luyan Post Station. Its organization is divided into six departments: registration, guidance, agricultural affairs, lending, commerce, and general affairs, with an attached farm, lending office, commercial office, supply department, and sales department. The morning market is located in Daying, 45 miles south of the county seat and 15 miles north of Luyan Post Station, covering an area of about 3,000 mu. Farmers are employed and paid five yuan per month. In two years, 1,200 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. The fleeing people have returned after hearing the news and have also reclaimed more than 100,000 mu. Loans have reached more than 20,000 yuan, and the matter is gathered. At the beginning of the reclamation, wild rabbits ran rampant, and the wheat and bean seedlings planted were almost devoured. The reclamation office initiated a "rabbit driving campaign" and formulated "general guidelines for measures." Villages such as Xiaomajia, Honglingpu, Suilijia, Jin Wangjia, Li Pai Gou, Stone Mason Zhangjia, Shaojiachong, Yaojiawa, Xia Liujia, and Youfang Township were used as the scope of the rabbit driving campaign. After overcoming obstacles, the reclamation work was able to proceed smoothly. Last year, two floods caused a lot of damage to agricultural products. The reclamation office finally lost money, and the returning farmers could barely make a living. Luyan Post Station was a post station in the Qing Dynasty. Before the Song-Tong section of the Pinghan Railway, north-south traffic all passed through it, and commerce was quite developed. There were cars to Fancheng, but they have long been out of service. Now, only rickshaws are used for transportation. When the reporter arrived at the post station, it was desolate and unbearable to look at. Recalling the prosperity of the past, he could not help but feel emotional. A lot of wasteland has indeed been reclaimed, but none of the original houses of the reclaimed farmers have survived. They temporarily live in thatched huts, with about ten to twenty people living in each hut, which shows that their economic strength has not been slightly eased. According to the deaf farmers, due to the lack of fertilizer and cattle, the output is far less than before. The reclamation office's loan interest is one cent per month, but there are restrictions. Sometimes, they have to borrow from other sources and suffer from usurious loans of four or five cents or even more. Therefore, it is not enough to maintain their livelihoods. The tax exemption period is only limited to three years, which will expire soon, and they will have to pay land taxes and surcharges according to other cultivated land regulations. The only hope of the reclaimed farmers now is to request the bank to continue lending money. It is heard that many reclaimed farmers have not gone through the registration procedures and have reclaimed land on their own. There are also farmers from Henan who cross the border to reclaim land and leave after harvesting, only to return next spring. The problem of the extinction of households and the death of descendants is inevitable. For example, in Li Pai Gou, 200 people were kidnapped by bandits at one time, and none of them survived. The remaining 50 or 60 young children all starved to death, but only one household was reported to have gone extinct in the village. It is unknown whether such problems have been corrected. The reclamation office is located in Luyan Post Station, and there is an office in Fancheng. The contract expires on May 31, and the office is being closed. The person in charge of the office has gone elsewhere, and there is no way to inquire. The experimental farm is located in Daying, and the agricultural experimental school is also located there. The farm has been taken over by it. According to the principal, Zhang Fuchun, the school is district-run and only has one class with 30 students who have not yet graduated. It is currently planned to expand the experimental farm and economic farm. According to Li Mengyang, a standing member of the reclamation affairs committee, the expenses used by the reclamation office must be approved by the design committee. The farm and sales office have lost more than 10,000 yuan and were used under the loan items without legal procedures, which will cause disputes in the future. Whether the agricultural bank and the reclamation committee will continue to cooperate is still under negotiation. Although the establishment of the reclamation office has not achieved amazing results, it has encouraged 8,000 to 9,000 farmers to return to reclaim land. The merits of its advocacy cannot be ignored. Although it has ended, the reclaimed farmers still hope that it will continue to provide loans, otherwise, although the wasteland has been reclaimed, they will not have the strength to cultivate it, and it will still be abandoned. The efforts of several years may be wasted in one day. The agricultural extension area is a reorganization of the agricultural experimental farm. The technology director, Yu Duo, is dispatched by the construction department and is currently in charge of forestry, planting tree species with greater adaptability on a yearly basis, which has been quite effective. The mountains of Yanghu, Hutou, and Fairy Cave have been planted with Masson pine, cypress, hemp, and Ailanthus altissima, covering an area of 10,000 hectares. The forestry of Longzhong is also within the scope of the extension area. The embellishment of the landscape is particularly ingenious. Other organizations, such as the rural construction experimental area, were founded by Zhang Ziye, a former teacher of the Fifth Middle School. The location is outside the East Gate, following the established rules of Ding County. The former commissioner, Cheng Zerun, once petitioned the provincial government to change it to a district-run organization. Only one month's money was allocated under the county government's expenses. Although the name of the district-run organization was preserved afterward, Zhang continued to operate it at his own expense. The initial work has been to run a people's school and plant more than 6,000 trees, with remarkable results. The farmers have great faith in it, but the personnel of the two Baojia are deeply jealous. It is probably not without reason that the new commissioner, Yang Sixi, abolished the district-run organization, which is a great pity. In addition, the oil tung afforestation also needs to be recorded. Last winter, Commissioner Cheng decided to plant trees on a large scale in Xiangyang and petitioned the provincial government to allocate 9,000 yuan for its establishment. Before it was approved, he first ordered the principal of the agricultural experimental school, Zhang Fuchun, to select barren mountains and wastelands in Xijia Pond, Guyin Temple, Yanqing Temple, Ganquan Temple, Qianshi Temple, and Wohuo Temple in the southern suburbs of the city as afforestation sites, and purchased 50 dan of oil tung seeds from Shihua Street in Gucheng and transported them to Xiangyang. This spring, the seeds were measured out in city dou and planted and afforested. First, the 14th Security Regiment sent three companies of soldiers to plant more than 20 dan in Yanqing Temple, and the civilian workers of the four Lianbao under the jurisdiction of the First District Office planted nine dan. The agricultural extension area and the rural construction experimental area each planted three dan, and the rest were not planted. The commissioner was changed and the land was transferred to the new commissioner. Although oil tung is very profitable, it also has a high demand for land. The oil tung afforestation land of the office is all bare mountains and ridges, with phosphorus-containing stones. Whether the seeds planted can grow into forests is doubtful. Cheng's plan said that "after ten years, it can obtain a profit of more than 3 million yuan and less than 30 million yuan every year." According to general speculation, it will probably end up being a bubble. (Issued in Xiangyang on May 24)</p>
<p>Gansu Provincial Government Orders All Bureaus and Checkpoints to Protect Business Travelers and Trucks Carrying Goods from Gansu and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Inspection of Goods Must Be Facilitated; Extortion Is Not Allowed in Passing Areas.</p>
<p>Lanzhou Communication: Since Gansu and Xinjiang are adjacent and business travelers come and go frequently, the Gansu Provincial Government requires all bureaus to facilitate the inspection of goods and the collection of taxes at any time, and no extortion is allowed to achieve the state's intention to protect the border people. This has been strictly ordered and followed.</p>
<p>Time Limit for Shipping Goods</p>
<p>As for the time limit for shipping goods, along the Western Route, when merchants transport goods from Xinjiang to Anxi County, the stipulated travel time from Anxi to Suzhou is 20 days, from Suzhou to Ganzhou is 15 days, from Ganzhou to Liangzhou is 15 days, and from Liangzhou to Lanzhou is 20 days. In total, the distance from Anxi to Lanzhou is 2,610 li, and the time limit for shipping goods is set at 100 days. In addition, if merchants encounter other unexpected circumstances that prevent them from transporting goods on time, they can report to the nearest bureau checkpoint, and the reason and date of the delay will be noted on the special tax ticket, and the seal of the nearest bureau checkpoint will be affixed to facilitate the extension of the time limit.</p>
<p>Tax Ticket Price</p>
<p>The cost of each tax ticket is only 15 cents, which has been waived since May 1 of this year. After the goods have been inspected and taxed at the first tax bureau, no extortion is absolutely allowed at other bureau checkpoints. These orders have been distributed to all bureaus for compliance. According to reports, merchants from Xinjiang in Gansu recently sent a letter to their fellow villagers in Beijing, stating the difficulties in doing business in Gansu. Although it is difficult to determine the truth, in order to encourage all bureau chiefs to correct any shortcomings and work harder if there are none, the directors of all special tax bureaus on the Western Route are specifically ordered to immediately inform their subordinates. In the future, the inspection of goods must be carried out in accordance with repeated orders, and a simplified chapter of goods and tax rates must be issued and handled properly. No delays or deliberate difficulties are allowed. After this order is known, if the above situation occurs again, once it is discovered or reported, it will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. (August 12)</p>

From 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM, light and fire control were implemented. Nine rescue stations and nine refuge stations were set up. The rescue and fire brigades were dispatched in full force and were quite agile. The general public was able to understand and was not alarmed.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Tongyi Company Closes Down</p>
<p>Tongyi Trust Company, a branch of the Shanghai Tongyi General Company, was opened at No. 3 Chengde Lane, Guanqian Street, Suzhou. Since its opening, it has been two years and has absorbed about 100,000 yuan in deposits. Most of the depositors are from the academic community, and most of them are Lingxing depositors. The manager is Zhu Xunwu from Zhejiang, who lives at No. 21 Dajing Lane, Dajing. The company suddenly received a telegram from the Shanghai General Company at 2:00 AM on the 16th, ordering it to suspend business immediately. Therefore, it stopped business on the morning of the 16th, and a note was posted on the door saying, "According to the telegram from the Shanghai General Office, business is temporarily suspended." It is also heard that the Shanghai General Office has also announced its liquidation on the 16th. The reason is unknown. The depositors were immediately panicked.</p>
<p>Taicang</p>
<p>Robbers Rob and Injure People</p>
<p>Wang Gentang, a resident of Lugou, a southwest township in Jiuqu Town, is a farmer and lives a well-to-do life. At around 2:00 AM on the 14th of this month, more than a dozen robbers suddenly came, speaking in a Hakka accent, and tied up the family members with ropes. The victim, Wang Gentang, was tortured by the robbers and was covered in wounds. The injuries were extremely serious and unbearable to see. After searching for about an hour, they robbed gold and silver jewelry and banknotes worth about 3,000 yuan and fled to the southwest.</p>
<p>Tax Surcharge for Overdue Deed Tax</p>
<p>In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, the economy has collapsed, and few people have gone to the county to pay deed tax for buying and selling land and houses. The provincial departments have repeatedly ordered rectification, but the effect has been minimal. Therefore, the tax rate was reduced starting in January of this year, which has been effective. As the deadline for the tax reduction is approaching, a surcharge will be imposed after the deadline. In order to reduce the burden on the people, the county government has issued a notice, urging all those with deeds that have not been taxed to pay as soon as possible to avoid penalties.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Flour Mills Resume Work on the Dragon Boat Festival</p>
<p>Maoxin No. 1, Maoxin No. 2, Jiufeng, Tailong, and other flour mills in the county were temporarily suspended due to a shortage of raw materials and soaring wheat prices in the spring. Recently, all the mills have suspended work again for the past month. Recently, wheat in the county has been arriving one after another, but the quantity is still scarce. Yesterday, 300 dan of Changshu wheat arrived on the market, with good quality, equivalent to about 85% of the wheat. The opening price was 6 yuan and 35 cents per bag. The price of other local wheat was about 4 yuan per dan. It is estimated that a large batch of wheat will arrive around the old lunar calendar Dragon Boat Festival, so the three mills in the county, Maoxin No. 1, Maoxin No. 2, and Jiufeng, except for Tailong, which has been burned down, have been scheduled to resume work on the old lunar calendar Dragon Boat Festival (June 23).</p>
<p>Detaining Coal Stolen from Liujiang</p>
<p>The Huashang Liujiang Coal Mine in Linyu County, Hebei, has been shipping to various provinces in Southeast China, and sales have also been strong in Jinghu and Zhenjiang in this province. After the mine was forcibly occupied by a certain Guotaiji Company last spring, the Liujiang coal was transported to the Buhai Sanjing Coal Yard, renamed Hebei White Coal, and sold everywhere. With the strong support of the coal industry and barge transportation industry in Shanghai, they agreed to refuse to sell and transport it, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Department was requested to issue an order to stop the sales. However, in early January of this year, Yu Yiqin, Lin Junbao from Wujin, and Sha Wenda and Hua Weiqing from Jiangyin, were greedy for profit and disregarded everything. They secretly contacted and sold it in Shanghai. The first batch of stolen coal, totaling 3,200 tons, was loaded by Ruikang and transported from Qinhuangdao to Jiangyin on the 5th of this month. It was controlled by the Jiangyin office of Zhongfu Foreign Company. 2,000 tons were stored in the Xingchang warehouse in Jiangyin, and the rest were transported to Wujin and Wuxi counties. Just in time, the traitorous merchants Ma Echun and Zhu Changshou saw the profit and formed the Yuanda Company (the Zhongfu Office in Wuxi) by pooling funds, and set up a liaison office at the Shengchang Hotel on the road, with Ma Echun as the director. They went to Jiangyin to negotiate sales. The first batch of 500 tons was loaded and arrived in Wuxi at 1:00 PM on the 15th. The matter was discovered by the secret investigators of the Wuxi District Commissioner's Office and reported to Commissioner Zang for handling. Zang telegraphed the County Mayor of Longxian, and then ordered the Public Security Bureau to send Inspector Wang Ji to lead all the inspectors to check both the north and south roads. Eight ships of stolen coal were found near Wuqiao and immediately detained and guarded by the police. Two ships were found between the Kuatang Bridge and Qingming Bridge in Nanmen and were also detained. The tax tickets and waybills were taken to the bureau and reported to the commissioner's office for disposal. Yesterday, Commissioner Zang telegraphed the province about the discovery of the coal and requested instructions on how to deal with it. It is said that the stolen coal was sold to Yitai under Yunqiao, Shaoxiangtai on Nanchang Street, Yongchang at Badatou in Ximen, and Yuantai and other coal dealers in Beitang.</p>

The team departed from Nanjing on the morning of the 15th and arrived in Zhenjiang first. They met with Chairman Chen at the provincial government and then visited Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs to inquire about the self-government situation in Jiangsu Province. It was learned that the Baojia organization and the strong men training in Wujin and the police management area in Kunshan have special achievements. The team left Zhenjiang in the afternoon and arrived in Changzhou. The members of the team were Deputy Director Li Zonghuang, Committee Members Zhou Bomin and Huang Bomin, Secretary Yang Yifeng, and Secretary He Zisu. On the morning of the 16th, they visited the county magistrate and then inspected the strong men's teams in the convenient rural areas. They paid close attention to the organization and subjects. After the inspection, they went to Kunshan for inspection.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The Truth of the Child-Killing Case Has Been Revealed</p>
<p>In the case of Zhang Lu, a widow in Dongxingsha, Shazhou, killing her son, the woman was first arrested and sent to the bureau, and she admitted that she first broke her son Yuqing's head with yellow stone, and then beat him to death with a rolling pin due to negligence. Then, the adulterer Wang Mao and Ji Kouhou, who helped bury the body, and two local monkeys were arrested and sent to the bureau. At first, they claimed to be completely unaware of the situation, but at 12:00 PM on the 15th, the situation suddenly changed after the director of the Public Security Bureau personally interrogated them. According to the adulterer Wang Maoguan, it was he himself who beat Zhang Yuqing to death. He claimed that he had an affair with the woman, but her son Yuqing found out and threatened to set fire to my house, so I did not dare to go to Zhang's house again and broke up with the woman. Unexpectedly, on the 25th of the intercalary March, Yuqing arrived at my bamboo garden at midnight, intending to set a fire. I caught him, but Yuqing's attitude was tough, so I strangled him to death with rice chaff. In a hurry, I went to Ms. Lu's house to ask for a solution. Ms. Lu still burst into tears at first, but after I repeatedly asked for help, she reluctantly agreed to help find a way and hired Ji Kouhou and the local monkeys to help bury the body. When questioned, the two accomplices also admitted that it was Wang Maoguan who called them. At this point, the truth of the case was revealed. It has been transferred to the judiciary for trial on the 16th. It is now known that the body was buried in a remote dirt pile and has been discovered by the villagers. It was not thrown into the river. However, the body is badly decayed. After reporting to the county, the county will send an adjudicator to the countryside to examine the bones on the 17th.</p>

<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Oil Mill Recruiting Commercial Shares</p>

<p>Investigation of Male Corpse on Wheat Field: Wu Songtai and Lu Maiguang discovered a male corpse on the wheat field. The deceased appeared to be in his twenties, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, brocade blue pants, straight woolen shoes, and white socks. After the local bailiff Zhou Lansheng reported the case to the local court, a coroner was dispatched. Prosecutor Li and coroner Shen arrived at the scene and confirmed that the corpse had several knife wounds on the head, which caused fatal brain damage. The coroner filled out the death certificate and found a diary nearby. The diary contained the words "Wu Ling Village 9616 Pavilion," as well as a business card with the name "Sun Wenhe." Since the deceased had no family, the prosecutor ordered the body to be taken to the morgue pending investigation and capture of the murderer.</p>
<p>1936 Fashion Trends: Westerners Embrace Chinese Ramie Fabric. Durable... Beautiful... Affordable... Ramie fabric is a unique Chinese product, especially the ramie produced in Liuyang, Hunan, which is the most famous. However, in recent years, the price of silk has decreased, and silk fabrics are both cheap and beautiful. Therefore, Chinese people have abandoned ramie fabric in favor of silk and gauze, causing the ramie industry to decline sharply. Modern women in the cities rarely wear ramie fabric. Recently, however, foreign women have begun to favor Chinese ramie fabric because it is made of hemp, making it durable, beautiful, and affordable. Therefore, they use it to make summer clothes. In the eyes of Westerners, ramie fabric is considered the most fashionable fabric of 1936.</p>

<p>Shanghai's Casing Industry: Compiled by China Credit: Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, No. 28 1. Overview: The intestines of domestic animals are collectively referred to as animal intestines, including those of horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, and others. In the past, they were rarely used for cooking, and slaughterhouses regarded them as waste. In 1900, a German soldier stationed in Beijing washed and processed discarded sheep intestines and transported them to Europe for sale, making a substantial profit. Since then, Chinese people have followed suit, and the intestine industry has flourished in North China. Later, due to insufficient supply, it was extended to Hankou, and Shanghai became the center of trade. Jiangnan and Zhejiang produce a large number of pigs, and vendors purchase them piecemeal from slaughterhouses and transport them to Shanghai for sale. Thus, Shanghai gradually became the center of the animal intestine market. Currently, China's casing exports include three types: pig intestines, sheep intestines, and beef intestines. Among them, pig intestines have the best sales, accounting for an average of 65% to 68% of the total. The exported intestines are stripped of their meat, leaving only the casing, hence the name "casing industry."</p>
<p>The export of casings has been increasing and has become more developed in recent years. However, various countries have been quite discriminatory towards Chinese intestines, citing unsanitary conditions and constantly trying to restrict them. The United States once implemented a ban, and Germany, the largest market, also announced that it would ban imports. A company in Chicago, USA, has even invented artificial casings. In the future, if the products are of high quality, casings can be replaced by artificial products. Therefore, in terms of foreign trade, the future is not optimistic. Looking back at the domestic market, the business is controlled by foreign merchants. Most of the Chinese-owned intestine factories in Shanghai are related to foreign merchants. In recent years, many Chinese-owned intestine factories have declared bankruptcy or reorganization due to insufficient turnover, resulting in a decline in creditworthiness, which is a concern for the world.</p>
<p>2. Source and Manufacture: The manufacture of Shanghai casings is mainly pig intestines. The source relies on local meat shops and slaughterhouses, and most are purchased from Rugao, Taixing, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province; Wenzhou, Shaoxing, Hangzhou, and Lanxi in Zhejiang Province; Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, and Hefei in Anhui Province; Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province; and Chongqing in Sichuan Province. Zhenjiang and Wenzhou are especially centers for the collection and distribution of pig intestines, with many vendors gathering and transporting a large amount to Shanghai each year. The intestines that are transported must be processed to remove the meat in order to prevent decay, which is called rough intestines. The salt used in the interior is coarse and black, and sometimes contains impurities, which can cause the intestines to change color, which is a flaw. The transportation of intestines is done in wooden barrels, bamboo baskets, and reed mats, with uneven units. In the past, each dozen could make ten pairs, but now the size has been reduced and only seven or eight pairs can be made. This difference in size results in significant losses for the intestine factory.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process of cattle, sheep, and pig casings is largely the same. Manufacturing workers must have skilled techniques. The fresh intestines purchased from the market are processed to remove the meat. This step is difficult. If too little force is used, the inner membrane will not be completely removed. If too much force is used, the membrane will be punctured and become waste. After that, it is called "smooth intestine". Then the size of the intestine is weighed and divided into seven grades. 21 points is one grade, 28 points is two grades, 30 points is three grades, 32 points is four grades, 34 points is five grades, 36 points is six grades, and anything above 36 points is seven grade. After grading, three strips are combined into one pair, and each pair is 12.5 yards long. Then they are mixed with salt (table salt to remove moisture), bundled (two pairs combined into a bundle the size of a fist), and packed into barrels (2,500 pairs per barrel). This completes the manufacturing process. The smaller the pig intestine, the better, but the opposite is true for sheep intestines. Their sizes range from 16 points to 26 points, with everything below 20 points being called one grade, and everything above being called two grade. Beef intestines are divided into two sizes, large and small. The size of the large ones ranges from 40 to 60 points, and the size of the small ones ranges from 30 to 40 points.</p>
<p>Approximately 2,500 pigs are slaughtered in Shanghai every day, and their intestines are only enough for one barrel. Currently, Shanghai intestine factories can produce ten barrels a day. Therefore, it can be seen that Shanghai's casing source is entirely dependent on other cities.</p>
<p>3. Export and Taxation: The use of casings is to make sausage. Domestic sales are declining, but the Cantonese help have some outlets. However, sales in Europe and the United States are very broad. Whether rich or poor, everyone likes to eat it, so casings also occupy an important position in export trade. Germany is the largest exporter, followed by France, the Netherlands, and the United States. During the European War, exports were booming, but then they became quiet again. In 1926, it was rumored that the United States would ban imports due to the lack of hygiene of Chinese intestines. At the same time, merchants in other countries were also afraid that the government would ban it, so they began to purchase and hoard in order to make a profit. Therefore, sales in that year were very strong. After the United States implemented the ban, China's exports decreased. Later, the Shanghai Special Municipality established the Shanghai Animal Intestine Export Inspection Office and began inspection. In July 1929, it was transferred to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Office. The main points of the inspection are as follows: 1. Determine the source of the casing. 2. Inspect the casing factory and its workers. 3. Inspection during loading. Only after the inspection is qualified can it be exported. Since then, the United States has lifted the ban, and other countries are also satisfied, so sales have been restored. The recent surge in sales is related to the world's expansion of armaments. The following table is a summary of exports for 1935. Pig intestines are mostly exported from Shanghai, while sheep intestines are mostly exported from Tianjin (quantity unit: quintals, value unit: yuan): Shenbao's contribution to the national goods special issue: Impressions of Nantong. By Yang An:</p>
<p>Nantong is the cradle of Chinese industry. The textile industry, in particular, originated in Nantong. The people of Nantong have made significant contributions to domestic goods. In Nantong, foreign goods are rarely seen in the market, and domestic goods are sold and used everywhere. The food and beverages in restaurants and hotels are also mainly domestic goods. The people of Nantong are self-sufficient in clothing, which is admirable and worth respecting.</p>
<p>Dasheng Yarn Factory has an annual turnover of 16 million yuan. The Nantong area produces 1.5 million dan of cotton per year. The income of the rural areas is also considerable, which is all real wealth and should be preserved, developed and promoted.</p>
<p>Jun Bingwen said: "The Chinese are holding golden rice bowls but begging for food from others." Those who hold golden rice bowls, please cherish them.</p>
<p>The native cloth market is an emerging industry in Nantong, and its serious inspection is commendable. This is a fundamental way to promote domestic goods. It is hoped that we can go one step further, establish a production and sales company, and set standards, so that a large amount of native cloth can be developed in other places. This is what I would like to discuss with the people of Nantong after my observations.</p>
<p>Obstacles to the Promotion of Domestic Goods. By Xiao Shi.</p>
<p>Correcting Erroneous Social Mentality, Inspiring Everyone to Use Domestic Goods.</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of smuggling, the sales of domestic goods have become increasingly stagnant, and the power of inferior goods has become more active. Patriotic people are thinking day and night about how to remedy the situation. However, in my recent contacts, what I have seen and heard is unbearable, and I have to speak out in order to correct the erroneous social mentality and inspire everyone to use domestic goods.</p>
<p>Someone made a fortune by specializing in selling certain goods in recent years. He was a poor man, but now he owns tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. Many people in society are short-sighted. Seeing this rise to prominence, they all admire and envy him and want to follow in his footsteps to make a fortune by smuggling. Alas! What is the impact? These people only want personal gain, how can they care about the rise and fall of the country's future? How can they care about the pain of national subjugation? We cannot use the law to control them, but we can use Tao Xiao to control them. At least, we must add the title of traitorous merchant to him to warn him to wake up!</p>
<p>Are students not the most noble people in modern times? There is no one who does not love the country. However, there are still some students who only care about the beauty and fashion of the color and the cheap price when buying things. Conscientious shop assistants clearly tell him to remind him, but he buys non-domestic goods. This is what a patriotic businessman told me.</p>
<p>I think that the psychology of young people who love beauty is the same, but if you only know how to love beauty but don't know how to love the country, once the country is destroyed, your family will be destroyed. Dear students! Correct your mistakes if you have them, and encourage yourselves if you don't.</p>
<p>The means of doing business by foreigners are really cunning. Some foreigners set up agencies in big cities. After people order goods, they can add the brand of a certain company or store and display them in the store. Although they also say that they are not domestic goods? There are also some compatriots who are loved by the people in the country who are really deceived by them inexplicably. Since the smuggling wind, this kind of trick is even more active, so that real domestic goods are replaced by fake domestic goods.</p>
<p>Things must rot from within before worms are born. We don't blame the foreign goods for invading so fiercely, but only blame the Chinese for not fighting. If everyone in China is willing to fight for a breath, recognize that domestic goods are our national treasure, and using domestic goods is the duty of the country, even if foreign goods are piled up like mountains, they cannot take away the sales of our domestic goods. Therefore, my final hope is that everyone recognizes that I am a citizen of the Republic of China. If I don't promote domestic goods and use domestic goods, I will ask: All people who are unwilling to be slaves are enthusiastic to fulfill their responsibilities. If we can do this, the obstacles to the future of domestic goods will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>An Interview with the Inventor of the Economical Light Bulb. By Meng: In this era of rural economic collapse, commerce is experiencing extreme decline! Staff members are being laid off, and the unemployment problem is serious! With no hope of increasing revenue, tightening belts and saving money in the most economical way is being valued by the general public!</p>
<p>I advocate that interviews with celebrities should change their writing style and interview the inventors of domestic goods, which is more practical!</p>
<p>Last spring, my old friend Mr. Qian Weiqing's son, Gongwei, began researching economical light bulbs. He worked tirelessly and finally succeeded after half a year of struggle! One day, I went to visit him and would like to record it as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Gongwei is a studious young man from Wuxing in his twenties, lively and capable! He shook hands with me and greeted me, and showed me the approval from the former Minister of Industry, Mr. Chen Gongbo, for his invention of the economical light bulb and the special patent. The Industrial Technology Review Committee was in charge of reviewing the invention, and according to the committee's report, the economical light bulb should be granted a five-year patent. After the six-month announcement period, if there are no interested parties who object, he may pay the fee in accordance with the regulations and receive the certificate. Mr. Qian told me that the announcement period expired on February 12 and he will pay the fee in accordance with the regulations to receive the certificate. He said with great satisfaction that he has raised tens of thousands of yuan in capital to set up a manufacturing factory in Wuxi, purchase the latest machinery, and hire skilled female workers so that the products can be produced quickly to meet the urgent needs of society. The light bulb is extremely economical because after the current passes through the square-shaped structure, the light can be brighter, and the consumption of electricity is economical. The reason is that it increases the amperage and reduces the voltage. The statistics show that it costs only 8.64 cents per month, which is only two copper coins per day. It is several times more economical than using kerosene lamps!</p>
<p>I think that if hotels and families change to economical light bulbs, even if they are lit all night, the cost will be very low. It can definitely reduce hotel expenses and household burdens. I believe it will be welcomed by everyone. Before leaving, Mr. Qian gave me a light bulb. I tried it and was very satisfied! Here, I introduce it to the domestic goods industry and the readers, and I wish Mr. Qian's business a great success!</p>
<p>Strict Industry Organizations and Elimination of Smuggled Goods. By Meng Zhao.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "If the fence is tight, wild dogs can't get in." Our country has fallen into a semi-colonial state, and the gates are wide open, and wild dogs are running around! The seriousness of smuggling has become rampant in public! Although all parties are actively carrying out the campaign to eliminate smuggled goods, "seeing profit and forgetting righteousness" is a common problem among merchants! They are "drinking poison to quench thirst" and do not know that they are destroying their lives! Therefore, merchant groups should strictly organize the same industry, supervise each other, and encourage each other! Selling smuggled goods is shameful! Once exposed, the punishment should not be lenient, and the reward for informants should be extremely generous! The evil merchants should know that selling smuggled goods is unacceptable, and that they will be punished and scared. If we proceed step by step, smuggled goods will eventually be a thing of the past! May the fellow merchants with conscience encourage each other!</p>
<p>Don't Buy Smuggled Goods. By Qi Zhong.</p>
<p>The problem of tariffs and smuggling is not only a fatal injury to domestic goods, but also a fatal injury to foreign goods. Therefore, not only must we Chinese people urgently solve this problem, but Europeans and Americans must also urgently solve it. Otherwise, in the near future, our domestic goods factories will completely close down, and European and American merchants will have to pack up and return home.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the problem still lies with ourselves. Europeans and Americans may not do business at most, but Chinese people will be subjugated. Therefore, we don't have to hope that Europeans and Americans will solve this problem for us, we have to solve it ourselves.</p>
<p>Let's start a "Don't Buy Smuggled Goods" campaign! Compatriots, for your own domestic goods, for the lifeline of your country, this "Don't Buy Smuggled Goods" campaign is so important! Aren't we making a fuss about "What Year" and "What Year"? Let's set the second half of this year as the "Don't Buy Smuggled Goods Year"! I think enthusiastic compatriots will certainly be happy and approve!</p>
<p>Another New Contribution from the Domestic Goods Industry. By Yi</p>
<p>Fan Fengyuan Invents Self-Made Bulletproof Glass</p>
<p>The bulletproof glass that has long been invented in foreign countries has a wide range of uses in modern times. The price of importing this kind of foreign goods is extremely expensive. Recently, Mr. Fan Fengyuan, a chemical engineer in our country, has independently developed and manufactured bulletproof glass. This invention is not only a new development in the domestic glass industry, but also can save a lot of foreign leakage every year. The following is a brief description of Mr. Fan's invention and his resume:</p>
<p>Mr. Fan has a considerable reputation in the domestic chemical engineering industry. In recent years, he has devoted himself to the research of chemical engineering and has established the "Fengyuan Chemical Research Laboratory". Recently, in view of the importance of the glass industry, he began this research. At present, in addition to inventing the coloring of glass, he has also invented this bulletproof glass, and its effectiveness meets world standards. The raw materials and compounds are recorded as follows: ... The above raw materials must be burned at a high temperature of 1800 degrees Celsius before they can be melted. It has a wide range of uses. In addition to protecting the safety of people's residences and vehicles, it is also required for soldiers, airplanes, and tanks. It is still necessary to have this kind of transparent protective material under steel defense.</p>
<p>The size of the glass invented by Mr. Fan is 20 inches as the standard, which is the same as imported products. If a steel ball weighing 200 grams is dropped naturally from 2.5 meters, the glass will not be damaged at all. If it is discarded at a high temperature of 200 degrees, heated for five minutes, and then suddenly put into water with a temperature of 20 degrees, it will not burst even if the temperature difference is 180 degrees. If this kind of glass is 10 millimeters thick, it cannot be broken or penetrated by a handgun shot from a distance of 20.5 meters. The above tests of several kinds of effects are all the highest standards of bulletproof glass in modern times.</p>
<p>Brief Resume of Mr. Fan: Mr. Fan Fengyuan is 31 years old, from Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, and has a Bachelor of Science degree from Jiaotong University. In 1930, he went to Japan to study at his own expense. After returning to China, he served as an engineer in the Electrical Machinery Factory of the Construction Committee, Director of the Shanghai Physical and Chemical Laboratory, Engineer of Yili Glass Factory, and Lecturer at Jiaotong University. He has written books such as "How to Make Dry Batteries", "Dry Battery Lecture", "Death Light", "Poison Gas", and "Wireless Radio Lecture".</p>

<p>Time Medicine Column Limb Numbness, Muscle Soreness, Bone Pain, Body Paralysis Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis. If delayed and left untreated, many complications may arise. If it enters the limbs, it causes numbness. If it enters the muscles, it causes soreness. In severe cases, it leads to hemiplegia. In critical conditions, it results in total paralysis.</p>
<p>The patient's excretion function declines, leading to excessive uric acid. The blood becomes impure. This uric acid forms crystal-like glass shards, often causing a sensation of soreness and pain internally. Treatment should not only remove the rheumatism but also purify the remaining toxins.</p>
<p>The renowned medicine "John Stearns Bone Pain Tablets" possesses pure and mild medicinal properties, suitable for the physique of Chinese people. Its efficacy is remarkably potent, providing excellent results in treatment. In the past two months, I have repeatedly used it to cure Mrs. Gu's hemiplegia, Mr. Wang's numbness of hands and feet, Mr. Tan's muscle cramps, and Mr. Bing's joint pain, all with the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission has both pathological and physiological causes, but physiological emission is rare, less than one in a hundred.</p>
<p>Any emission that causes remorse, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, or a combination of these, and any emission occurring more than twice a month, is pathological and must be treated promptly.</p>
<p>Sufferers often believe that tonics can cure nocturnal emission, but they are ineffective. Consequently, they delay treatment, thinking it incurable, which leads to various symptoms of weakness. This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>The treatment for this condition is to first stabilize the essence and then use gonadal preparations to replenish the deficiency. This is far superior to using tonics that do not address the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Feng indulged in masturbation in his youth, leading to nocturnal emission. He delayed treatment, and it was never cured. This spring, he was introduced to me by Guo Zhenjun for diagnosis and treatment. I prescribed "Hemitol Essence-Stabilizing Tablets" to strengthen his essence gate and instructed him to purchase and take the gonadal preparation "Reproduction Element" from Taihe Pharmacy. Within a month, the nocturnal emission was completely eradicated, and his body regained health and strength, appearing like a different person.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea, Hidden Illness, Secret Self-Treatment Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Women's constitutions are weaker than men's, making them susceptible to illness. Seeking medical attention can be inconvenient, and they may be embarrassed to reveal hidden ailments, leading to a loss of health and beauty. This is truly pitiable.</p>
<p>Most women's diseases are due to a deficiency in gonadal hormones and impaired uterine health. For example, if the uterus becomes inflamed, it leads to the suffering of leukorrhea. Treatment should be both internal and external.</p>
<p>"Female Reproduction Element" is a gynecological panacea with the functions of strengthening the uterus, regulating menstruation, promoting conception, and ensuring a safe pregnancy. "Leukorrhea Eliminator" is a combined preparation of lactic acid bacteria, vaginal bacilli, and liver starch. It is used externally to treat leukorrhea, providing anti-inflammatory, bactericidal, disinfectant, and leukorrhea-eliminating effects. Last month, I repeatedly used it to cure menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, and vaginal diseases in Mrs. Shao, Ms. Zheng, and others, all with remarkable and satisfying results.</p>
<p>Kidney Weakness, Premature Ejaculation, Combined Treatment with Electricity and Medicine Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Patient) Mr. Lu, 39 years old, from Ningbo, businessman.</p>
<p>(Chief Complaint) - Sexual neurasthenia, kidney weakness, premature ejaculation, infertility after long marriage, loss of vitality.</p>
<p>(Treatment) - Last winter, he was introduced for diagnosis by Mr. Zhiwei Wang. I instructed him to purchase and take the gonadal preparation "Reproduction Element" internally from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company. To expedite treatment, I also administered painless electrotherapy. Within a month, his chronic illness was alleviated, and his vitality was restored as if he had been reborn. Last month, Mr. Lu came to thank me, saying that his wife was now pregnant. The renowned medicine had delivered a child, for which he was eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Case of Simultaneous Treatment for Bone Pain, Stomach Pain, and Nocturnal Emission Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>(Patient) Mr. Xing, 31 years old, from Zhejiang, worker.</p>
<p>(Chief Complaint) - Chronic stomach illness with intermittent pain, internal rheumatism, bone pain and muscle soreness, frequent nocturnal emission, weak brain, and insomnia.</p>
<p>(Treatment) - In addition to administering electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase and take "Stomach Pain Reliever" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to treat the cause of his pain, and "Stomach Strengthener" to nourish his weakened stomach. His stomach pain was thus cured. For his rheumatism and bone pain, I used "John Stearns Bone Pain Tablets." For his nocturnal emission, I used the renowned medicine "Hemitol Essence-Stabilizing Tablets." Because Mr. Xing's body was weak, I also prescribed "Reproduction Element" to nourish him. After taking the medication for half a dozen times, his body regained health and strength, resembling a vibrant dragon and tiger.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea Cured Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Nine out of ten women suffer from leukorrhea, but they often keep it secret and are ashamed to seek medical treatment and medication. Little do they know how much it deprives women of health and happiness. It is truly pitiable.</p>
<p>Mr. Ke from Dihua wrote from thousands of miles away last winter, requesting an introduction to effective medicine for self-treatment because his wife's leukorrhea was worsening, and local doctors had no effective way to cure it. I replied, advising him to take "Female Reproduction Element" internally and use "Leukorrhea Eliminator" externally for self-treatment according to instructions. Due to the long distance, postal correspondence took time. It wasn't until late spring that I received his letter of thanks, along with two photos of his wife before and after treatment. He said that Mrs. Ke's years of leukorrhea had been cured, and she was now healthy and strong, unlike her former self. Her breasts had also undergone healthy and beautiful development. Looking at the two photos, one would suspect they were two different people.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea and Kidney Weakness</p>
<p>The difficulty in treating gonorrhea lies in finding a medicine that can directly reach the source of the disease and have a transmembranous bactericidal effect. If the treatment is improper, the reproductive glands will be poisoned, leading to the suffering of kidney weakness and premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>Early this spring, I used "Anti-Gonorrhea" to cure Mr. Fang's chronic gonorrhea of many years, using only five boxes of the medicine. Because he had severe kidney weakness, I instructed him to purchase and take "Reproduction Element" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to restore his vitality. After taking several boxes, his vitality was rekindled, and he regained health and strength, leaving with joy and gratitude.</p>
<p>Bone Pain and Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>The source of bone pain is not only due to the accumulation of rheumatism but also to the uncleared toxins. Treatment should address both aspects and not neglect either. The renowned medicine "John Stearns Bone Pain Tablets" contains precious ingredients and has pure medicinal properties. It is effective in treating bone pain, with effects like medicine arriving and disease disappearing.</p>
<p>This spring, in addition to using it to cure bone pain in Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zheng, and others, I also prescribed "Reproduction Element" internally to help them quit their long-term smoking addiction. To achieve rapid results, I also simultaneously injected "Nutri-Vitality Assurance." This eliminated toxins and provided nourishment, taking only about three weeks.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and Leukorrhea</p>
<p>The pathogens of gonorrhea are caused by the gonococcus. It is mostly contracted through unclean sexual intercourse. The harm caused not only results in the loss of vitality and various complications in the affected individual but also transmits to their spouse, causing leukorrhea, and harms their children, easily leading to blindness.</p>
<p>In addition to taking "Anti-Gonorrhea," women can also use "Leukorrhea Eliminator" externally. To achieve rapid results, electrotherapy should not be neglected. Taking "Reproduction Element" internally can help restore health and strength as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Ni and Mr. Sha, along with their wives, complained of suffering from leukorrhea. I treated them using the aforementioned method, with the treatment period lasting about one month for each.</p>

In the past, lung tuberculosis, cancer, and gonorrhea were recognized worldwide as the three most difficult diseases to treat. With the advent of this product, many difficulties in the medical field can be eliminated. I have repeatedly used it to treat patients with acute and chronic gonorrhea, all with remarkable results in completely eradicating the disease.</p>

<p>(1) Infertility After Long Marriage, Happy News of Pregnancy</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhang, 35 years old, from Sichuan, businessman. Mr. Zhang was born with insufficient endowment, weak and prone to illness. Because of his suave behavior, he was quite popular with the opposite sex, leading to many extramarital affairs, which greatly depleted his energy and worsened his condition, resulting in premature ejaculation. His girlfriends gradually treated him with disdain, as if he were a stranger. Mr. Zhang suffered both mentally and physically, gradually developing neurasthenia, dizziness, blurred vision, lower back pain, and backaches. Since marriage, there had been no hope of children. He sought medical attention and took medication, but it was ineffective. In mid-February of this spring, he came to me for treatment. I found that his reproductive glands were extremely atrophied. In addition to using scientific electrotherapy, I also instructed him to purchase and take "Reproduction Element" from the Sino-British Pharmacy. After taking the medication, his physical fitness gradually improved, his reproductive glands were restored to health, his lower back became stronger, and his premature ejaculation disappeared. We met at a banquet last month, and he mentioned that his wife was several months pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) Kidney Weakness and Nocturnal Emission, Combined Treatment with Electricity and Medicine</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou, 29 years old, from Hankou, academic. Mr. Zhou was induced by bad friends to engage in masturbation ten years ago. He indulged in it every day, greatly depleting his essence and causing symptoms such as nocturnal emission and insomnia. He could no longer concentrate on his studies, leading to a sharp decline in his academic performance. After marriage, he also developed symptoms such as kidney atrophy and seminal depletion. He took tonics repeatedly, but they failed to cure the root cause. Starting last year, nocturnal emission became more frequent, occurring more than twenty times a month. His body became exhausted, and his spirit declined. It wasn't until this spring that he was introduced by his classmate Fan Jun to see me for diagnosis and treatment. I administered electrotherapy on one hand and instructed him to purchase and take Hemitol "Essence-Stabilizing Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission, and "Reproduction Element" to treat his kidney weakness, for about five weeks. His body became strong and healthy, and all symptoms disappeared. His progress in his studies exceeded that of the past.</p>

<p>Examples of Clinical Treatment in Venereal Disease and Smoking Cessation Clinic by Doctor Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>A Case of Safe Treatment for Nocturnal Emission and Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Sun, 35 years old, native of this province, occupation unclear. Mr. Sun had been smoking for at least ten years. Initially, Mr. Sun suffered from severe nocturnal emission due to indulgence in alcohol and sex. Repeated treatments were ineffective, leading to forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, and lower back pain, causing him great suffering. He accidentally tried opium at a friend's house and felt invigorated. He smoked it for a long time, becoming addicted. Opium then turned into a numbing agent. If he occasionally didn't smoke, not only would he feel uncomfortable all over, but all kinds of symptoms would immediately flare up. Only then did he realize that smoking couldn't cure the disease; it merely masked and concealed it. He tried to quit many times and tried various methods, but all failed because the symptoms didn't go away, and smoking cessation couldn't be fully achieved. Last winter, he was introduced by his colleague to see me for treatment. I prescribed "Hemitol Essence-Stabilizing Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emission and instructed him to take "Reproduction Element" to eliminate his smoking toxins, break his smoking addiction, and treat his various symptoms of weakness. Because Mr. Sun wanted to shorten the quitting period and recover his health as soon as possible, I also injected him with "Nutri-Vitality Assurance." Within a month, the entire mission was successfully completed. (Note) Both Wing On Zhongxi sell the above.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, Leukorrhea, Bone Pain in Husband and Wife</p>
<p>Patients Mr. and Mrs. Kong, both under 30 years old, from Zhejiang, merchants. They came for diagnosis last month, complaining of suffering from gonorrhea and bone pain. According to them, Mr. Kong had accidentally visited a brothel in his early years, contracting a venereal disease, which was transmitted to his wife, causing her to suffer from leukorrhea. They had tried numerous treatments, with the condition improving temporarily before recurring after a while. After years of neglect, the toxins entered their bones, causing pain that was unbearable. They saw that a neighbor who suffered from chronic gonorrhea was cured by me using "Anti-Gonorrhea," so they also came to me for treatment. I immediately instructed them to purchase and take "Anti-Gonorrhea" from Wing On Company to completely eradicate their gonorrhea. Mrs. Kong also used "Leukorrhea Eliminator" externally for secret self-treatment according to instructions. For their bone pain, I mainly used "John Stearns Bone Pain Tablets" for treatment. Because the medicine was targeted, the husband and wife were able to return to the bedroom within just one month.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<p>What a Solemn Surrender Ceremony</p>
<p>Xing An</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Reuters) - Fifty Abyssinian chieftains and dignitaries, dressed in the traditional robes of Abyssinia, participated in a solemn surrender ceremony in the Abyssinian capital today. This ceremony was ordered by General Graziani, the Italian acting governor of Abyssinia. All those present gave the Fascist salute and recited an oath invoking the names of the Italian King and Mussolini. Abyssinian General Buna represented the group in reading the surrender document, which stated that they recognized no other authority besides the Italian King, Emperor of Abyssinia. In response, General Graziani stated that the Italian authorities intended to respect the religious beliefs of the Abyssinian people.</p>
<p>The strong truly deceive the weak! Not content with annexing Abyssinia by force, Italy even ordered a surrender ceremony, commanding fifty Abyssinian chieftains and dignitaries to humiliate themselves on the spot to celebrate their victory. The intention of General Graziani, the Italian acting governor of Abyssinia, in issuing this order was none other than to demonstrate to the world the submission of the Abyssinian people and to compel a group of shameless Abyssinians to swear allegiance to their masters. However, we find this humiliation extremely unbearable. The pain of national subjugation is a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance!</p>
<p>However, Italy is not to blame; the fifty Abyssinian chieftains and dignitaries are the ones to be hated. These traitors, seeking only their own glory, disregard the honor of their country. Dressed in the traditional robes of their homeland, they gave the Fascist salute before the enemy, invoked the names of the Italian King and Mussolini, and read the surrender document, demonstrating absolute servility. Their loss of conscience is so extreme that they can be called the most shameless people in the world!</p>
<p>However, Abyssinia has no shortage of such despicable individuals. During the Italian-Abyssinian War, a group of traitors betrayed their country and surrendered to the enemy. Chief Geffcha of the Tigre Province was the foremost among these Abyssinian traitors. He led 13,000 Abyssinian soldiers in surrendering to the Italian army. Mussolini had at one point planned to establish a new state within Abyssinia, intending to use this ready-made puppet. Unfortunately, this plan did not materialize, leaving him greatly disappointed!</p>
<p>The situation in our country is similar. With the coercion of foreign powers, traitors emerge endlessly. The likes of Pu Yi and Zheng Xiaoxu willingly act as slaves of the enemy. Their heinous crimes have long been spurned by the people. Pu Yi once personally visited a certain country to express his gratitude, a clear display of his loyalty. In recent times, many shameless traitors have become even more active in the north and south. Everything they do is aimed at harming the country, fearing that our nation will not perish soon enough. If our country is unfortunate enough to suffer the same fate as Abyssinia in the future, we believe that more than fifty people will be willing to participate in the surrender ceremony!</p>
<p>Hope Qin Huai</p>
<p>Shortly after moving to the Huabei Apartment, I found that I had a new circle of friends. These "friends" were not really close. We just gathered together to chat and relieve boredom when we were lonely. No one infringed upon anyone else's life or other aspects. These kinds of friends are common among us drifters. There are many, many of them.</p>
<p>The first person who spoke to me was Old Fan, the tenant of Room 18 downstairs. He was a mild neurotic who liked to sing Peking Opera. Almost every night, he would sing a few excerpts from "Huang Tianba." His behavior was annoying, but because he was a clerk in the provincial government, no one dared to challenge him. I think I was the only person in the whole apartment who could get along with him. No matter how much he bragged or went crazy, I always praised him. As a result, he would tell everyone, "That Mr. Qin upstairs is amazing. He's learned and capable." His words did have a very good effect on me. The cashier and tea server were exceptionally respectful and polite to me, and even the other tenants were friendly towards me.</p>
<p>Through Old Fan's introduction, I met a tenant named Liu. It would be more accurate to say he was a muddler than to say he was honest. He lived on the second floor with his father (who spent all day smoking opium, supposedly scheming to get a county magistrate position). However, he rarely stayed in the room except to sleep. The father and son didn't talk to each other, as if they had some kind of feud. He knew almost everyone in the apartment. He would go into anyone's room. He spent all his time chatting with people. During the day, he was very close to the tea server. He would always share the melon seeds he won from the lotteries with the tea server. As a result, the tea server would tell him many near-secret things: what kind of work the guest in that room did, whether the man had a girlfriend. In short, he knew everything about everyone in the apartment. With this information, he would tell A about B, and C about D, so that everyone in the apartment knew what everyone else did.</p>
<p>One time, he told me he had found a job. His father's friend had found him a clerk position in the provincial government's civil affairs department. The next day, he wrote a resume. He asked the tea server to buy him three resumes. When he returned, he had ruined them all, so he bought more. He was sweating profusely as he wrote, writing a total of fifty-eight resumes, but he still hadn't succeeded. Finally, even the tea server got tired of it. He had already run to the stationery store eighteen or nineteen times. He couldn't wield the pen anymore, so he asked me to write it for him. The next afternoon, his father took him to the civil affairs department to see the director. When he came back, he said to me: "Mr. Qin, I wouldn't be a clerk even if I had to beg for food. Damn it, when I got there, the director grilled me for a long time, and at the end, he asked me to write a small regular script. Heavens! I was already sweating all over when I talked to him, how could I write small script? My hand was shaking when I picked up the pen. Luckily, he didn't make it difficult for me, and let me come back." As a result, he didn't become a clerk, and later he had other ideas.</p>
<p>His father wouldn't give him much money to spend, but he needed a good sum of money to spend freely! He had no choice but to find a way to get money. One afternoon, he took a set of envelopes and stationery and asked me to write him a letter. The letter was to his uncle in Peiping, falsely claiming that his father was seriously ill and urgently needed money for medical treatment, asking his uncle to send fifty yuan immediately upon receiving the letter. I don't know if this was successful, but he spent money as freely as before.</p>
<p>From then on, he held a desperate attitude towards his livelihood. He admitted that he was finished, that he would never amount to anything in his life, so he had to live life a little more romantically. Soon, his cousin came to Tianjin from Guandong, and he became invigorated, following his cousin in and out of the × concession every day. The Zhonghua Tea House, the New Inn, and the Beiyang Hotel all had traces of him. But he still took the time to talk to me in the midst of his busy schedule. He talked endlessly about prostitutes, white powder, and how easy it was to make money in the gambling houses.</p>
<p>After his cousin returned to Changchun, he told me that he had great hope for the future. His cousin had already arranged a principalship at a small school, and in the future, he hoped to become the director of the finance bureau of ×× County. By the time his cousin wrote back next month, he would be able to go to Guanwai. He even asked if I wanted to go? Of course, I politely refused. I didn't have that kind of "hope."</p>
<p>After Old Fan moved to Baoding with the provincial government, I went back to Peiping.</p>
<p>When I returned to Tianjin in the winter, I happened to see the hooligans occupying the Yi Jiang Suo on Dongma Road. I saw that man named Liu in the crowd. I quietly avoided him. I wonder if his hope had achieved its goal?</p>
<p>Odd-Jobber, Child Bride Che Jun</p>
<p>—The magpie's tail is long; once married, the daughter forgets her mother.</p>
<p>A large braid, a plump face, eyes that blinked at people all day long, thick and red lips, a navy-blue Western-style shirt, thick blue cloth trousers, and pink Western socks with blue shoes on her big feet. She was fifteen years old. Her name was Jin Huanzi, and she was a child bride whom her second cousin Lao Hei had "brought back" with a bride price of forty yuan. The little woman's father used to run an oil press in the town. The business was very prosperous, earning one or two hundred yuan a year. Later, he somehow got addicted to morphine, and his family property was squandered. He then wanted his wife to go to the big store in town that entertained traveling merchants to "accompany guests." The farm woman, who had grown up in the fields, had a backbone and was unwilling to do such a dirty thing, so she committed suicide by jumping into a well one dark night. After his wife died, the morphine addict turned his attention to his daughter because her reputation was bad, no one wanted to marry the daughter of a thief. The woman herself was not a top-notch product. Her "worm-shit sleepiness" and blinking eyes were not endearing. During the temple fair in March, her second cousin, Lao Hei, won more than seventy yuan at the Baoju gambling stall. When his aunt saw that her son had so much money, she eagerly expressed her thoughts:</p>
<p>"Heizi, I want to discuss something with you,"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"You'll be thirty (years old) by the end of the year, right? Your brother never married in his life. He ran around aimlessly, got sores, and died. Listen to your mother and marry a wife. You have money now. Spend a few dozen yuan to get one. In the future, she can have sons and daughters, and after a hundred years, they can go to the grave to offer incense and paper money for me and your father."</p>
<p>Her second cousin Lao Hei had been beaten for having an affair with Widow Ma, which was the most embarrassing thing for "beachcombing guys" like him. He had long intended to get a woman. When his aunt mentioned this, he grinned, as if something had touched him, and smacked his lips:</p>
<p>"Mom, you ask someone to take care of it. I'll see if her face doesn't look like Pigsy, and then we'll spend a few dozen yuan and have her feed the pigs and grind the mill for you."</p>
<p>It was that simple. The morphine addict led his daughter Jin Huanzi to the market in town. At the matchmaker's house, Lao Hei saw this plump little woman who didn't like to lift her head. He smacked his lips and agreed on a price. The next day, the son-in-law and father-in-law directly settled the account. After the morphine addict counted the money, he went to the medicine needle house to get a fix that was more than enough. Then, he took his daughter to her husband's house. For lunch, his aunt wrapped two pounds of chive and pork dumplings. The two families, along with the couple who hadn't yet been wed, ate together. The mother-in-law looked at the daughter-in-law and thought she was quite strong, and she felt a little happy in her heart. After being a widow for twenty years and raising her child, she had finally become a mother-in-law.</p>
<p>For the first month or so after entering the door, the little woman worked very diligently. In the morning, after sweeping the courtyard clean, she went to the stove to cook porridge. After eating, she washed the clothes, or she carried a basket to dig pig feed. Lao Hei often went to the temple fairs in other counties to set up a "stall". He wouldn't come home for ten or fifteen days. Every time he came back, he carried a lot of copper coins, paper money, sesame cakes, and crispy fish in his bag, and sometimes he brought a few feet of floral cloth. His mother knew that it was for his little wife. She took the cloth and shouted:</p>
<p>"Girl, come and I'll make you a shirt."</p>
<p>Lao Hei flushed and said embarrassedly.</p>
<p>"Don't give it to her, don't give it to her, Mom, you keep it."</p>
<p>At this time, the mother-in-law would smile and look at her son's silliness. After a while, she pulled over the daughter-in-law who had just walked in, draped the cloth over her, and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I'll cut it and you can learn to make it yourself."</p>
<p>Lao Hei often got impatient at this point and shouted roughly:</p>
<p>"I bought it for Mom, why is she wearing it!" At the same time, his mother would smile and say:</p>
<p>"I'm over fifty years old, should I wear floral patterns? Do you think I'm an old goblin!"</p>
<p>The little woman blinked at her husband, raising her thick lips.</p>
<p>The mother-in-law was happy during those days. She rejoiced in her son's filial piety.</p>
<p>After the wheat harvest, the young couple often secretly became "intimate". The little woman vomited for a few days and often liked to eat green apricots and other things. The mother-in-law knew that the sixteen-year-old daughter-in-law was already pregnant. So, in June, she chose an auspicious day and told the two of them to worship their ancestors. That night, they were considered to have "consummated the marriage" (a specific term for child brides entering the bridal chamber).</p>
<p>From that day on, Lao Hei, the reckless man who was famous for being money-hungry in the gambling stall, obediently listened to the little woman's words. She no longer cooked or liked to wash clothes. She always cried and said she was sick. When Lao Hei returned from the town, he bought all kinds of sweets, always tiptoeing and avoiding his mother, secretly feeding the little woman. The mother-in-law moaned and groaned all day long as she worked. She wanted to learn the ruthlessness of her own mother-in-law, but she only quietly cursed a few times. When the man entered the door, the little woman would cry and scream, forcing him to divorce her. Lao Hei would roll his eyes and shout:</p>
<p>"Want me to marry, marry and then think of breaking it up, what does that mean!"</p>
<p>At this time, the mother-in-law could only cry sadly to herself. She remembered the nursery rhyme "The magpie's tail is long..."</p>

<p>Opening "Hongniang Delivers the Letter"</p>
<p>A stretch of ten miles of apricot blossoms in the springtime. Miss Yingying is in her boudoir. Because of Zhang Junrui in the West Chamber, she is too lazy to do needlework by the window. And because, the old mother in the hall is strict, and a strand of love cannot be communicated. The other day, Hongniang came to the West Chamber. She said that Zhang Junrui was sick in bed. The slave girl wants to visit in person, but her mother is strict. The slave girl can only write a letter to Zhang Junrui, telling him not to worry about her. She quickly took the writing instruments and ground the ink with her slender hands. She gently wrote the letter and signed it with her flower name, folding it carefully. She hurriedly called Hongniang, asking her to deliver it to Zhang Junrui in the West Chamber on behalf of the slave girl. Hongniang, took the order of the young lady, and hurriedly walked out of the corridor and turned east. She walked into the bamboo fence with two doors. She only saw that the flowers and plants in the garden were bright and colorful. White peonies and begonias were planted along the steps. The roses cleverly leaned against the bamboo screen. She also saw, outside the twelve railings. Peach blossoms blooming towards the east wall. Magnolias have already turned green. The old plum blossoms are very exquisite. Hongniang, moved her golden lotus lightly and walked quickly. She hurriedly walked over the small arched bridge. She only saw, a row of weeping willows by the bridge. The railings on the bridge were vermillion red. Mandarin ducks rested in the lotus pond. The flowing water rustled. She could not finish viewing the scenery in the garden. She had to hurry to deliver the letter. She walked through the Zen forest and passed the winding path. She saw ahead, a small reception hall facing east. Inside, there were lingyu and emerald decorations. The exquisite carvings were truly exquisite. The piano, chess, calligraphy, and painting were hung in two lists. The four-colored articles were hidden in the bookcase. A pair of couplets divided left and right. The signature at the end, the handwriting was as good as Wang Youjun. The first line is, the wind blows thousands of willow branches. The second line is, raindrops of peach blossoms all over the ground red. In the middle hung a painting by a celebrity. The painting was of flowing water and high mountains with skillful brushstrokes. The purple sandalwood chair table was slippery. The ball lamps were on both sides of the brocade screen. She saw that, Zhang Junrui, was sleeping on a sandalwood bed. She, called him softly. Sir, I am here on the order of the young lady in the boudoir. I have come to deliver a letter. Sir, listen. Smilingly. He took the silver note and opened it. It wrote, Cui Yingying, humbly greets Sir Junrui in the West Chamber. The other day, the bandits revolted and Sun Feihu, with thousands of followers, besieged the temple. The mother, had made a vow in the Buddha hall. Willing to marry her fate to a husband. Saying, regardless of monks, soldiers, or bandits, whoever repels the bandits. She would marry her daughter. Because of us, three lives should not be cut off. The benefactor came, my Sir. Immediately, Huiming fought his way out of the encirclement. He sent a letter to Pukou. He brought, the white horse general with soldiers. He killed them, and they withdrew like the wind. Now, the soldiers and civilians are at peace. Unexpectedly, my mother changed her mind. She persuaded me several times. How dare I not comply. Now, I advise you, to take care of your health first. Do not let the slave girl, be in your heart. Wait until, the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, play the qin in the Dan Gui Pavilion. The slave girl will call Hongniang to invite the Sir. At that time, there will be things to say.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Japanese government is fully implementing the policy of colonial immigration in order to solve the problems of population, rural areas, and industrial raw materials. For the South Seas and China, it has decided to use the two companies of the South Seas Colonization and Taiwan Colonization as the center to actively develop the economy and obtain industrial resources in a peaceful manner to seek substantial development. As for the first phase of immigration to Manchuria, the number has been determined to be 100,000 people (2,000 families), requiring a total of 2,000,000 yuan in expenses. It can be realized immediately after the cabinet meeting on July 3. In order to implement the great policy of immigrating five million people to Manchuria (accounting for one-tenth of the entire population of Manchuria), the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has now obtained close cooperation with the Army, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and other ministries. When necessary, in addition to the Manchurian Colonization Corporation, it may allocate another 50,000,000 yuan in capital to establish an assistance corporation to ensure smooth progress.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Italian Newspapers Deliberately Maintain a Calm Attitude and Coerce with International Cooperation <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Since British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain issued his speech on lifting sanctions, the country's newspapers have expressed different opinions, with some supporting and others opposing. The semi-official organization newspaper "Italian Daily" has recently reprinted excerpts from the British newspapers' arguments and added comments, stating: "Although Britain now has a tendency to return to reason, its will is still uncertain. This can be seen from the speeches of British newspapers. As far as the international situation is concerned, although some foreign newspapers have expressed optimism, in fact, they are still in a precarious state, and unexpected accidents may still occur at any time. As long as this kind of uneasy situation exists for one day, the Italian people will not dare to have any illusions for one day, and they should calmly and suspiciously observe the changes, because the past actions in Geneva have taught Italy a lesson, and it has to be so." (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The signatory countries of the Lausanne Treaty are scheduled to hold a meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, on the 22nd of this month to discuss the re-establishment of defenses in the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits. Whether Italy will participate at that time will depend on the attitude of the League of Nations towards Italy. Responsible parties recently declared: "The League of Nations wrongly judged Italy as an aggressor country and implemented sanctions against it, which was a big mistake. If this mistake is not corrected for one day, Italy does not intend to participate in any cooperative undertakings in Europe for one day." The general interpretation of this statement is that if the Council of the League of Nations and the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations do not make any decision on lifting sanctions before the end of this month, Italy will refuse to participate in both meetings. Furthermore, according to some local declarations, the Italian government may submit a written statement to the League of Nations, stating that Italy is not an aggressor country, but there is no basis for those who make this statement.
