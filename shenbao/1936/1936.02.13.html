<p>時評</p>
<h3>如何集中意志</h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>中央宣傳部吿國人書已載昨日本報綜覽全文不特對於主旨所在之「集中意志共赴國難」一點言之剴切詳明足以示救國之正軌卽對一部分為熱情所驅使有遭人利用之危險者亦不啻予以誠懇之忠吿吾人除希望愛國之士讀此有所憬悟以外更就所見以討論此集中意志之事如何乃能實現</p>
<p>第一目前國難全由外來欲謀挽救必須全國一致以對外此理至淺顯一般人士當能理解在驚濤駭浪之中同舟之人如先自紛擾而欲舟之不覆身之倖免又豈可得明乎此則處今日危急存亡之形勢中設尙有人乘機煽惑以圖破壞國內秩序其人非昧於國族存亡之義卽對中國現階段之國難或未能認識淸楚故欲實現集中全國意志必先使此類人士祛其所惑澈悟前非以共赴於救國之正途</p>
<p>其决國人怵於禍變之亟心理既異尋常情緒允為激越現請行為乃失鎭靜持中之力易為鼓動利用之資環境所牽偶一不慎救國者或竟轉以誤國今中央明白表示一責任重大不敢稍忽誓本主義勇邁前進惟一目的為對外為吾民族求獨立平等瀏內為吾國家求自立自强」夫救國之心人之所同讀此告語應立共信共信既立則意志之集中乃實現矣</p>
<p>復决中央當局「深知非積極準備集合全國之人力物力形成整個之偉大力量决不足以救亡而圖存」除非有人能就反面立說證明救亡不須準備不集合乃可以圖存老則熱情誤用寗不可惜過去國內意志紛歧之結果致國力無形削弱國難日益增重事蹟彰彰不難覆按國人當此危局鑑於前此紛歧之害則可於集合力量準備救國之大目標下先集中其意志吾則授人以隙不知不覺中變成黨國之罪人矣</p>
<p>總之論大局則集中意志卽為集合力量之根本救國步驟萬不可亂論個人則輕舉易涉反動議牲而無益於國殊為不值明達之士苟能體認黨國當局艱忍謀國之苦心則集中意志之事今日著之言說老將來不難見諸事實也</p>

<h3>照相與繪畫</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>一位朋友毅然地斥百金買一架照相機，熱心地從事攝影。弄了一會，大失所望，把照相機棄捐笥篋中，廢然地走來向我訴說他的失敗經過。其言如下：</p>
<p>「我為一種夢想所驅而買這架照相機。我的夢想是這樣：我很熱心於寫生畫，速寫簿時時帶在身上。無論在家裏，在校裏，在路上，在舟車中，看見了畫材，倘有寫生的機會，一定把牠們記錄在速寫簿上。然而寫生的機會不能常得。因為雖日「速寫，」畢竟也費幾分時光。而我眼前的現象，往往變動無定，不能給我當幾分鐘的莫特爾。所以常常因為來不及速寫，把很好的畫材放走，甚覺可惜。這時候我沒有學過攝影，憑膚淺的想像，以為照相機的攝影只消數秒鐘，甚至半秒鐘，比繪畫的「速寫」速得多。有了這件機，一定可以多收幾種畫材。况且有許多活動狀態，像運動選手賽技的姿勢，走狗的脚的動向，蝴蝶飛舞的光景等，大都難於速寫，又不易記憶，是畫材收集上一伴難事。我想有了照相機，一瞬間的現象也可自由捉住，正可獲得許多珍貴畫材呢。</p>
<p>「為這種美滿的夢想所驅，我毅然地買了一架照相機，又請人實地指導用法。花費了好幾星期的時光，和好幾打底片，總算會照了，同時那美滿的夢想也就失敗了。為的是「事非經過不知難，」我以前以為照相機能在隨時隨地自由捉住現象，實際决沒有這麼便當，第一，要講光錢。光綫弱的地方，開半秒鐘不够，動的現象就不能照。燈下，月下，開數秒鐘也不够，人物也不能照，只能照靜物或風景，而且風吹草動的風景也不能照。第二，耍講距離。十二步以內的現象，要先用眼睛測量現象與物之間的步數，把鏡頭紳縮到該步數上，然後可照。不然，現象就糊塗。第三，還要講光圈。……還有我所沒有學完全的種種手法和技術。故我所發見的畫材，卽使光綫的條伴滿足，也耍打開鏡頭，準備開關，較正距離，酌量光圈，然後攝影。所費的時間興速寫相差有限，所費的手續實比速寫浩繁。攝過後又不像速寫地可以立刻給人鑒賞，還要拿了底片到特備暗室中去洗。顯象，定影，淸水漂洗，在幽暗的紅燈底下模索了好久，才得一張，黑白相反的底片。等侯底片乾了，再到暗室中去偷出晒象紙來，晒像，顯影，定影，到這時侯，才能在淸水盆裏看見一張像畫的束西。然而十張裏頭，總有八九張不像畫；其像畫的一兩張，也只有一兩分像畫。因此我大失所望，把照相機棄捐在筍篋中，當牠一種貴重而精巧的玩具。有興時偶然拿出來玩玩，但與我的繪畫生活毫無關係。我的夢想完全失敗了。」</p>
<p>他的向我訴述，是要求我給他說明與慰安。於是我把照相與繪畫的區別，二者的不能互相模仿，以及二老在美術上的各自的使命，一一吿訴他。使他知道怎樣修正他的夢想，怎樣處置他的照相機。其言如下：</p>
<p>繪畫與照相，是判然不同的兩種東西。二者的區別，可說繪畫是眼與手的藝術，照相是鏡頭與底片的藝術。眼與手的藝術的美，是人工的！鏡頭與底片的藝術的美是機械的。在前者中，主觀性勝於客觀性；在後者中則反之，客觀性勝於主觀性。蓋繪晝雖然也照客觀物體的形象而描寫，但其中盛用心的經營，和腕的活動，好像寫字一般，各人有各人的筆致，明顯地表出着各人的性格。故數人對同一莫特爾寫生，寫出來的作品趣味很不相同。照相雖然各人技術不同，但技術的差異只在取景採光，晒象等上，客觀物體的形象始終是客觀的。故多人共對一物攝影，其結果大同小異，相差决不會像繪畫之紛歧。洋畫初入中國時，一般淺薄的洋畫信徒拘泥於寫實，幾乎要把自己的眼睛代替了鏡頭而作人工的照相。（就是在現今，一般低級的洋畫學習老還在做這樣的死工作。）美術照相初興時，一般未練的照相家競取模糊的景色，柔美的調子，以冒充印象派繪書。這兩者，都沒有理解繪畫與照相獨得的特色，而欲以繪畫模仿照相，或以照相模仿繪畫。近來美術照相日漸進步，不復如前之冒充印象派繪畫。在雜誌上，在展覽會中，常見有許多名手的照相頗能充分發揮鏡頭的技巧。這些作品與繪畫異趣，而獨具一種美的價值。反之，在畫界中，似乎倒不不及照相的進步。以模仿照相為能事的繪畫，現今還是到處被歡迎着。像月份牌，擦筆肖像畫，香烟畫片，都是其例。</p>
<p>天地間美的現象，可分兩種。一種是天生成就美觀的，不須人工代為布置，只消設法照樣保留，便有美術的價值。另一種具有美化的可能性，但須經過人工的經營，方能成為美術品。前者宜用照相表現，後者宜用繪畫表現。例如：日光下的美麗的影，天空中的雲的紋樣，海邊的水的紋樣，以及自然界一切天生成美觀的現象，都是照相的好題材。至如傳達春訊的梅蕊，解語似的花，通人情似的鳥，天造地設的勝景，以及一切合理想的境界，需要人工加以選擇，增刪，變形，及配置，方能給人美感者，都是繪畫的好題材。用繪畫去表現照相的題材，吃力不討好。用照相去表現繪畫的題材，勢有所不能。故二者不能互相代謀。總而言之：對自然微妙微肖，是照相的能事；依人意變化改造，是繪畫的能事。卽前老是美的「再現」，後者是美的「表現」。自來論藝術的人，往往輕再現而重表現，以為前者是畫葫蘆的工作，沒有藝術的價值；後老本乎氣韻生動與感情移入，才是有生命的藝術。我以為這話在現代未可槪論。講到藝術的價值，照相自然遜於繪畫，但照相實其足美術品的資格。因為一者，如前所述，天地間實際有着宜於用照相表現的美景。在現今機械發達的時代，藝術上亦何樂而不利用機械？二者，微妙微肖，再現藝術，最合於一般通俗人的美術鑑賞眼。以此作為引渡一般人進入美的世界的寶筏，也是文化藝術上極有意義的事。所以我勸我的朋友不要希望以照相模仿繪畫，也不要把照相機當作玩具。要明白照相與繪畫的區別，而以機械時代的一種新美術看待照相。</p>

<h3>歷史科演講</h3>
<p>— 中小學本國史敎材的運用　國立編譯館專任編審　鄭鶴聲</p>
<p>諸位聽衆：今天要講的題目是「中小學本國史敎材的運用。」目標定了，對於敎材的運用，才能有一貫的綫索：我們中國爲世界上第一個文明古國，對於歷史記載的起源，也算最早，所以我國史料比較任何國家，都爲豐富，我們要加研究，自然發生困難。從前宋朝宰相文文山就有「一部十七史從何處說起」的話。現在單就正史而論，已不止十七部，何况再有其他的史書呢？梁任公先生感到生平有屢决受窘的一件事，就是他每决遇到靑年學子問他研究本國史應該讀何種書籍的一個題目，他就「沉吟久之」而終於不能對答，他的意思，以爲除了二十四史，資治通鑑，三通等書以外，再沒有別的方法可以對答，然而今日百學待治的世界，要想讀此浩瀚的古籍，是吾爲靑年男女力所許可，姑且勿論，允當問費此莫大的歲力，其所得者究能若干？我們欲知吾祖宗所作事業，是吾求之於此而已足？不但不足，就是遍讀隋唐志明史……等所著錄的十數萬卷，仍嫌不足。舊史旣然不可遍讀，就是遍讀也不能供給我們的要求，那末只有不讀。眞個如此，恐怕不及十年，而中國的史學，將完全被驅出於學問圈之外。因此緣故，他就想到本國史的改造，眞是目前最迫切的一個問題。歷史敎科書的編纂，就是要想彌補這個缺憾。</p>
<p>美國方面，當兒童自己能够讀書的時侯，就往往從口授的方法，轉到書本的講授了。美國人以爲講授歷史之最重的帮助，莫過於敎科書，實在說起來，敎科書不僅是帮助，在大部份美國學校裏面，敎科齊决定講授的事實，同敎授的方法，一個敎師請他敎小學三年級以上的無論何級學生，幾乎一定要求一本敎科書備學生之用，直到中學歷史課程完了爲止，世界各國對於敎科書的採用，大致一律，我國學校，自亦不能例外。</p>
<p>敎科書旣爲中小學生所必需，所以編纂敎科書的使命，殊爲重大，對於敎材的運用，就是一個先决的問題，允其是關於歷史上的敎材。美國史學家魯濱孫氏嘗說：說關於歷史這一科，我們沒有同算學一樣的一種明定的綱要，雖然普通歷史家編訂歷史敎科書的時候，以爲他們已經將各種最重要的事實都包括在內，好像化學家或地質學家編他們那樣自然科學敎科書一樣，但是歷史是很特別的，因爲歷史所研究的是異常複雜的東西，不像化學一樣有一定的現象。」又說：「過去的事實旣然如此的豐富，現在我們有什麼擔保可以說普通歷史家已將人類經騐中最重要的最有關係的事件，提綱絜領的叙述下來，以備敎授兒童之用？」就是這個道理。關於這層，便是如何運用敎材的問題了。茲就個人所見到的，提出二點，說明如下</p>
<p>運用敎材的中心問題　人類事實的發生，至爲繁複，我們應該想個「以簡馭繁」的方法，就是這裏所說的中心問題。在這繁複之現象當中，究竟何者足以爲歷史上的資料，首當明瞭歷史的定義，歷史的定義，不外記述人類社會賡續活動的體相校其總成績，求得其因果關係，以爲現代一般人活動的資鑑。實含有敎訓的意義，美國史家的翰生亨利說：「歷史這樣東西，恐怕自從人類有歷史的覺悟以來，就爲敎訓的一部分，」就是這種意思。不過事蹟研究的對象，也各有不同，學問家的研究歷史，和敎育家的講授歷史，其中心思想，顯有岐異之處，大抵學問家的目的，在搜羅荒僻的材料，窮究高深的學理，以求專門學術之進步；敎育家則在擷取各部分的重要事項，發揮其精義，希望於國民道德上知識上收得應用的效果，前者屬於研究高深學問的大學專科學校的資任；後者屬於普通敎育的中小學的資任。但如何能擷取其重大的事實，而發揮其精義，以爲一般國民的資鑑，這就賴先有一中心的思想，以為裁剪的標準。</p>
<p>這種中心的標凖，常隨時勢和環境的需要爲轉移。自十八世紀以來，普魯士因欲建立統一的國家，於是民族主義的史學，所謂普魯士學派者，就風靡全國，法國方面當革命以前，歷史與地理的講授，國文法及文學的講授，連以後，歷史方面特別注重革命的本身，因爲在敎育上的價値，常以其國家民族的利害爲前提。魯濱孫氏嘗說：一現在我們的利害，是繼續的變化的，所以我們希望過去來回答的問題，也不能不常常變化了。我們近來有許多歷史敎科書，瞻敢刪去了許多沿用無當的事實，而且想將他們的記載同現在的需要聯絡起來。但是我們以爲這種推陳出新的方法，還可以再進一步；我們最好的敎科書裏面，仍舊包括許多不値得兒童注意的事實，忽略了許多最値得叙述的事實。」道段議論，是很値得我們做參考的。</p>
<p>我們社會國家民族目前的事勢和環境是怎樣？我們運用本國歷史的中心思想又該怎樣？這是很値得注意的一件大事。我國現在事勢和環境，正是內憂外患交迫的時候，但如何能够達到「安內攘外」的目的呢？則在求之歷史上的敎訓，安內攘外，是一整個的事件，因爲能够安內，就可攘外，我國歷史上關於內憂外患的事蹟很多，成效得失，歷歷可數，例如衛懿公好鶴，淫樂奢侈，爲狄所減，國破身亡，衛文公以大布之衣，大帛之冠，務財訓農，通商惠工，敬敎勸學，授方任能，元年革車三十乘，季年乃三百乘，終以復國。秦孝公想修繆公的覇業，收復被侵的失地，下令求賢，商鞅聞之入秦，整頓內政，秦乃大興。又如西晉士大夫，以淸淡爲高，以致亡國，而東晉元帝任用賢才，當時負政治軍事的人物，已除去淸淡的習慣，轉爲積極的行動，祖逖累謀北伐，誓復中原，嘗擊楫渡江自稱：「逖不能淸中原，而復渡者如此江」！陶侃出鎮荆湘，平定內亂，其在廣州，朝夕運百甓，叉惜光陰，嘗取酒器蒲博之具，皆投之江，謂　蒲爲牧豬奴戲，非士大夫所宜出此。王導與名士游宴南京的新亭，謂「當共戳力王室，克復神州，何必作楚囚對泣」！我們讀歷史的人，可知志士仁人，處於艱危的時候，無有不以堅卓的精神，以復興的責任自負，東晉的所以偏安江左，大抵依赖這種精神。</p>
<p>關於我社會國家民族興亡盛褻的陳跡，不過略舉數例，已足爲目前建國救亡的敎訓，其餘事蹟，不可勝舉。我們講授本國史，應以「如何能安內攘外」一問題爲其中心的敎材。關於歷代社會國家民族的歷史，例如開創國家，（如黃帝中山先生等）中與復國，（例如越王勾踐衛文公等）開拓邊疆，（例如漢武帝唐太宗等）宣揚國威，（例如班超鄭和等）平定內亂，（例如郭子儀李光弼等）抵禦外侮，（例如戚繼允兪大猷等）奉使不屈，（例如蘇武張騫等）扶持艱危，（例如王導謝安等）殺身成仁（例如岳飛文天祥等）急公好義，（例如弦高卜式等）以及傳播民族主義，（例如顧炎武黃宗義等）發明科學製造，（例如張衡蔡倫等）諸先賢先烈的性行事蹟及其與整個社會國家民族歷史的關係和影響，以及學術思想的變遷，社會制度的蜆化，道德風俗的隆汚，國民經濟的榮枯……等等，皆宜詳加講述，盡量發揮，其餘不關這類的史實，不妨盡量的减少，使學生明白建國和救亡的責任，和在世界文化上的貢獻。</p>
<p>各級敎材的支配問題歷史講授的價値，不外道德的訓練，公民的訓練，記憶力判斷力和想像力的訓練，這種訓練，對於學生年齡的大小，知識的高下俱有極大關係，照我國現行學制而論，大抵小學和初中學生，年齡幼穉，知識簡單，無論生理上或心理上的發育，皆未能完全，較爲抽象或高深的事理，往往不易瞭解，高中學生，已俱有歷史的基本觀念，其生理上或心理上的發育亦達充分的程度，選用敎材，不妨稍爲高深繁複。歷史敎材的支配必當與學生生理心理發育之程度相適合。所以關於各級敎材的支配，也是一個很重要的問題。的翰生古了利以爲：「初步的歷史，嬰用抽象的方法表示出來的事實，就是高等的歷史，對於小學校最初發年級的學生，歷史內容應該以實例爲主，這種歷史應該以描寫同叙述爲主，不定要解剖的。要用推理的時候，亦要以能够立刻變爲實例爲主，這並不是說小學校中的歷史非完全用描寫的文章不可，亦並不是說小學校中的學生，不應該有推理同剖斷的機會，這不過說，推理的同應用的材料，應該以屬於實例方面的爲主，如此編訂的歷史，同如此講授的歷史，過了五六年之後，當然可以慢慢的將一般的事實，引到高年級裏面去，對於十歲或者十一歲的學生，還是要以實在的特別事實爲主；對於十七歲或者十八歲的學生，特別的事實還是要繼續下去，不過我們的討論，應該可以向到一般的歷史方面去」。這段議論，對於敎授中小學生歷史程度的分辨，最爲明白，很値得歷史敎師的注意。（未完）</p>

<h3>駐土公使館參事　王芃生回國　據談土國情形與我大致彷彿上下團結一致故能日趨興盛</h3>
<p>新聲社云、我國駐土耳其公使館參事王芃生、因公於上月十四日、携同夫人、自土京昂哥拉啟程、繞道保加利亞·羅馬尼亞·波蘭·經西伯利亞回國、於十日、由海參崴乘俄輪伯利號抵滬、在滬勾留三日後、業於昨晚、乘十一時夜特快車晋京、擬晋謁蔣院長·張外長·王氏行前、曾與新聲社記者、暢談士耳其政情　、及中土兩國關係、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>上下一心</p>
<p>王氏首述十六年來土耳其進步之迅速、由次殖民地一躍變而爲完全獨立之國家、推原其故、無非爲國內上下一心一德、團結奮鬥所致、在內政方面、對共產黨嚴加取締、但與蘇聯、則取得密切合作、最近自倫敦經濟會議停頓後、蘇聯曾一次借給土政府美金八百萬元、分期二十年償還、並無利息、且償還時、可以貨物作抵、而無須現金、此種辦法、無異先期付欵購貨、土國得此借欵後、完全充作建設輕工業並樹立重工業之基礎之用、以致國內工商業日趨興盛、至外人在土國境內所經營之事業、如鐵路·電話·水利·等等、均經次第收回、經濟上完全獨立、脫離外人之　絆、並實行經濟統制、使進出口貿易平衡、卽政府所聘外籍職員、所得收入、依土國法律、亦不得匯回現金、祗可購買土國貨物、代替現金、寄交其家屬、土國人士之思想、接近我國三民主義、如節制資本、大規模之企業、盡歸國營、平均地權、禁止地產投機交易、其與共產主義之不同、在與私人資本合作、私人營業、則須受政府限制、與泛繋主義之不同、在於不容納社團主義、復反對帝國主義、自己不欲造成爲帝國主義之國家、與中國不同之點、則在求國際平合作、而不採大同主義、爲絕對的民族主義國家、對於任何外國團體、尤其以屬於文化方面者、禁止在土設立分社、蓋以國家獨立未久、爲避免外國勢力之侵入也、</p>
<p>外交勝利</p>
<p>土國之外交、可分作三個階段、第一、謀求國家獨立、卽土希戰爭時期、以英國及希臘爲對象、集中本國力量、以分散敵人力量、實行各個撃破、與法國及意國取得妥協、第二、維持和平建設、卽穩定國際關係、以平等之精神、獲得合作、奠定國家基礎、第三、參加國家政治、如締結巴爾幹條約、加入國聯、及與波蘭伊拉克·阿富汗、訂立四國互不侵犯條約、現在土國之地位、非僅形成巴爾幹半島之重心、抑且可謂執中央亞細亞與西南亞細亞之牛耳、</p>
<p>中土關係</p>
<p>中土兩國邦交、歷史悠久、上起獴狁·匈收突厥·回紇、及至宋時文化關係益深、其後民族逐漸西遷、其中斷絕關係甚久、迨元始祖成吉斯汗率兵西征、當時曾攻至昂哥拉、至今昂地尙有其遺跡、至現在關係、胚胎於淸代、當我國第一任駐英欽差大臣郭嵩燾在任時、土國駐英公使、卽向郭要求訂約、嗣於光緒四年、曾紀澤使法時、土國駐法大使、又向曾要求、惜當時坐失時機、蓋其時適帝俄佔我伊犁、俄土發生戰爭、若兩國有約、則左宗棠·劉錦棠·等正有重兵駐在新疆、如合力攻俄、則亞洲情勢、當不至此、迨民國十四年、土耳其駐比大使、向我國駐比公使王景岐、又提出訂約要求、因雙方意見未能一致、致談判中止者、凡五六次、直延至二十三年春間、始經駐瑞士公使胡世澤、在土京昂哥拉、與圭政府訂立友好條約、</p>
<p>商約問題</p>
<p>王氏續謂、關於締訂中土通商條約、中央訓令駐瑞士公使胡世澤繼續進行、因有種種關係、一時尙難實現、查土國與各國所訂商約、其所本原則有三、　國家負責、（卽對方亦係統制經濟之國家）　個人負責、（個人求償）　國家負責連帶個人求償、（此係折衷辦法）以本人之意見、在我國立塲、與土國訂立商約、唯有引用其第二項原則、一三兩項、殊不通宜、至於我國駐土使館情形、一切尙佳、緣使館之任務、本有　保護、如護僑及維護本國一般物質精神利益　交涉、如受本國政府訓令、及使館本身發覺而建議者、　觀察、如觀察駐在國情形、及駐在國外交團對國際係之意見、現駐土使館、成立已歷九月、對於第三項觀察、已有相當成績、計分半年爲一期、第一期業已完成、分門報吿、呈外部編印、凡二十卷、訂作十本、旅土華僑、因受土國政府法令、限制外籍人士之小職業、而華僑之職業、凡屬於小職業者、因是多改入土國國籍、俾取得與土人同等待遇、現在華僑僅有十人、使館方面、正在設法加以補救、土國外交及新聞界、甚同情我國現況、盼我國自强云云、</p>

<p>中外邦交</p>
<p>是年七月下旬，工部局接得上海市政府公函、送達市政府敦陸中外邦交佈吿若干紙、請租界當局代爲在界內張貼、該項佈吿內開、奉國民政府令、凡中國國民、應陸守邦交、不得有仇外及挑撥國際惡感之言論行爲、更不得以此目的、組織任何國體、以至危害邦交等語、租界當局爲增進睦誼及重視禮貌起見、特申述案由、加蓋騎縫關防、在界內各處、佈吿週知、而法租界方面、亦有同樣之舉動、</p>
<p>界內緝私</p>
<p>中國政府海關緝私、法公佈於一九三四年之六月、嗣後租界當局、各國領事團、及海關方面、迭經磋商如何恊助華方、在界內取締走私事宜、最後、至一九三五年交涉完成、工部局允對於界內中國商民、及無治外法權國家之商民、還有走私隱匿商品情事時、應協助海關搜查、惟提起控訴之權、仍應歸工部局法律部辦理云、</p>
<p>華籍地委</p>
<p>工部局地產委員會之加聘華籟委員二人、發生於一九三二年納稅人年會之議决案、當時即由工部局建議於領事團、將地產章程之規定、略加修正、並以此事係屬增進華籍市民之利權、中國當局、不致有所反對、惟改訂地產章程手續方面、略見遲緩、至一九三五年、中國政府始承認工部局地產委員會添設華籍委員二人之舉、此事遂吿一圓滿之段落、</p>
<p>樂隊存廢</p>
<p>是年納稅人年會中、曾有人提議、工部局停辦現有之樂隊、改由上海歌唱會、或其他相當團體接辦、每年由工部局貼補經費、不得超過十五萬元、惟此議並未得通過、嗣後工部局音樂委員會會組織小委員會、負責調查、樂隊改組事宜、六月十二日、音樂委員會復奉董事會之命、審查現有樂隊、是吾應改組、以資節省、以及是吾應保留一與現有組織相等之樂隊、後由小組委員會建議、現有樂隊、應予停辦、另行組織更爲减省之樂隊、並提議定是年十二月三十一日、爲該樂隊解散之期、其理由約爲該隊一九三四年之費用、爲二十七萬八千五百元、而音樂會堂及辦公處房租等、尙不在其內、據該小組委員會之見解、將來新樂隊成立之後、經費不得超過二十萬元、（租費等不在其內）、是即每年可節省經費七萬八千餘元、音樂委員會根據上項小組委員會之主張、建議於黃事會、贊成現有樂隊之解散、惟解散日期、應定爲一九三六年四月三十日、或其他董事食擬定之日、嗣經董事會詳加計議、深覺樂隊之存廢問題、應聽諸納稅人之自由處置、遂决定此事、應再提出於一九三六年之納稅人年會、任其解散保留或另行組織新樂隊、惟爲便利迅速施行納稅人意旨起見、一切樂師聘仟合同、及無合同臨時聘任之樂師、一槪規定於一九三六年五月終解職、此外並决定如納稅人贊成保留一與現在樂隊人數相等之樂隊者、該項樂隊應按照音樂委員會小相委員會所擬具之大綱組織之、即該隊應有隊長一人、副隊員一人、銅器樂總敎練一人、及其他樂師四十四人是也、故工郁局樂隊之存廢問題、現尙靜待一九三六年納稅人年會之處置云、</p>
<p>烟毒取締</p>
<p>據工部局送達國際聯盟之報吿、一九三四年中、鴉片烟毒之在上海、仍屬根深蒂固、鴉片之吸用、雖見减少、而其他毒物、如嗎啡。海洛因、等之服用、幾有以暴易暴取而代之之勢、再則租界烟民、以尙無登記辦法、故爲數若干、迄無相當之統計、一九三五年度、因烟案被逮人犯的八千名、其中判罪者六千六百餘、開釋者一千三百餘人、現租界常局、對於烟禁所感之困難、即國際毒物巨販、俱非親自携帶經營之人、故極難加以拘捕、且彼等時或假借國籍、揑造護照、情形實至複雜、租界當局惟有盡力爲之而已、</p>
<p>白俄婦女</p>
<p>白俄難民中之靑年婦女、久已成為上海一社會問題、當一九三四年年終之時、工部局曾接得國聯之誚求、將本埠白俄婦女生活情形、呈報國聯、本年二月、工部局報告國聯書中、曾稱本埠白俄婦女、成年者的二千、未成年者的四百、公共租界之中、雖無官准之妓　、然的略計之、白俄婦女中之以賣浮爲業者、的一百三十人、偶然賣淫者的一百四十五人、此等偶然操淫業者、百分之八十爲各舞場舞伴、查公共租界、俄國娼寮、最早發生於一九零五年及一九二零年、俄國難民、自西伯利亞結隊而下、俄妓遂廣佈於滬埠、至一九三一年、日軍侵佔東北、俄女復自哈爾濱蠭擁而至、白俄婦女之操淫業妓、遂大見增加、及至一九三三及一九三四之間、社會經濟、益見衰落、白俄婦女情形、遂至不可收拾之地、爲今之計、惟有供給價格低廉之住所及食物、聊作治標之法、現私人設立救濟白俄婦女機關、共有六所、彼等亦有同樣之報吿、送呈國聯云、</p>
<p>市政實習</p>
<p>復有一事足紀者、即中國國民政府之派遣學員、來公共租界工部局、實習市政、此事發生於前年中國南京當局之建議、嗣後、中國學員、被派來局實習者、共六人、均派在局內各部份見習、示以管理統制之方、以及其他市政上重要之知識、此外浙江警官學校、復於本年三月、請求派員前來實習火政、四月中杭州公安局、復有派員來局、實習指紋檢騐及槍械檢騐之請求、均經工部局火政處及警務處等、與以相當實習之便利、此種合作、大致深爲中國當局所讚許、而中國當局之重視租界之行政方針、於此亦可見其一斑矣、（下略）</p>

<h3>上海桐油業槪况（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之十三）</p>
<p>二，內銷——內銷桐油，除白油外，洪油亦屬主體，秀油則微乎其微，上海銷售範圍，的分三處：　華北帮，包括烟台，天津，靑島等地，專銷大簍裝之京方油；　內地帮，包括蘇，錦，杭，嘉，湖等地，專銷洪油；　崇沙帮，包括崇明南通一帶，專銷洪油及浙油，銷油時開分春銷伏銷秋銷三期，以伏銷爲最旺，但近年各地農村破產，桐油內國銷路，終年無聲無吳。疇昔鼎盛時期，上海洪油銷數，年可十叫萬桶，但上年祗銷二萬五千桶。社會經濟凋敝，購買力薄弱，固屬主因，而客家產額减少，亦屬原因之一。據云洪江一縣，在十年以前，對外洪油營業額年達七百萬元，現竟减至二百萬元。在此銷數急遽退减中，同業貶價競爭，仍不稍懈，故其營業方針遂羣趨緊縮一途矣。</p>
<p>至桐油之運輸，在輸出國外方面，全由外輪獨攬，近年外輪新置輪船，特設油艙，故對美輸運，均改裝散艙，旣經濟又方便，毒担運費的二元八角。對歐輸運，仍沿用木桶或鐵桶，每担運費的叫元五角，國內方面·我國上游各省，自產區輾轉運至集中地，其運輸船隻亦多外輪，蓋我國現時長江輪有油艙設備者，竟無一艘。普通山萬縣運裝漢口，每擔運費連捐稅在內，的須二元一角，由漢口裝太古或招商之輪船來滬者，每擔運費的一元叫角五分。浙油出滬杭車運滬，每砠（凈油市秤一百二十四斤）運費的五角六分。</p>
<p>（三）市價之升降</p>
<p>桐油市價，視國內生產之豐歉，國外銷路之增减，金銀比價之漲跌，國內政治之安擾爲轉移。白油價在民十年間，每擔的二十八元，歷年雖有起伏，但至民二十年每擔仍在二十七八元左右。近年來變動劇烈，在前一二元之差額不能多見，而現今則輒有四五元之上落。民二十二年四月發見十八元低峯，二十四年九月出現八十五元高價。此項市價，亦受洋商操縱，藎國內尙無經營直接出口之機關，各桐油商又不能五相聯絡，共謀目衛也。上年入夏以後，油價一再高漲，但其時適値新陳不接之際，存油早已廓淸，漲價徒有其名，油商仍無實惠。洪油市面，十年來一落千丈，已無季節性可言。</p>
<p>上海桐油市價，白油以漢口杭州爲標凖，洪油以鎭江爲標凖，同業雖議公盤，但批價仍不一致。以白油論，有時上海售價反較漢口杭州爲廉，蓋以油質爲伸縮。洪油莊客，分駐洪江，常德，漢口，鎭江四處。鎭江之莊客，負推銷及開盤之貞，每常春銷之前，揭開售價，稱爲頭盤，伏銷之前，再開售盤，稱爲二盤。上海洪油售價，即以鎭江之頭二盤爲標凖，但以同業競銷關係，亦難劃一市價也。茲將歷年來桐油高低價列下（單位元）：</p>
<p>爲標凖（註三）以尖秀爲標準。</p>
<p>每逢舊歷正月初五所開之頭盤，俗稱紅盤。紅盤狃於習俗。開價必昂。本年因存底單薄。據云全市洪油已不足千件。白油亦祇七八百擔。故其紅盤開價更高，與上年底收盤相比。一致加高二三元不等，惟能吾按盤開售，實屬疑問。茲將本年紅盤價列左。</p>
<p>（四）經營桐油之行家</p>
<p>上海桐油業，頗具悠久之歷史，遜淸道光年間，莘莊胡氏即創辦胡悅來桐油號於南市外郞家橋，可稱本埠桐油業之鼻祖。嗣後該號幾經改組易名，但胡悅來桐油至今仍燴炙人口。胡悅來舊址，今且改稱悅來街。至於同業現狀，按其帮派系統而言，可分爲錫帮，寗帮兩種，錫帮勢力遠駕後者之上。沈元來，湧成元及恒祥三號其發展雖較靑帮爲遲，但今日營業額之鉅，則可執同業之牛耳。但就一般而言，該業因平時經營穩健，各行尙稱安定。本埠經營是業者，除沈元來湧成元，爲沈氏獨資經營，南源來，北源來爲胡氏獨資經營，恒祥錦爲徐氏獨資經營外，其餘均爲合夥經營，資本自一萬元至五萬元不等。（未完）</p>

<p>六、改變人生必先確立革命的人生觀</p>
<p>（中央社十二一日南京電）蔣院長二月十日在中政校、對全體學生訓話、茲錄其原詞如下、</p>
<p>各位敎職員先生官長各學生、今天是本校長今天是本核銷今年開學後每一次到學校講話、記得去年也是在春季開學的時候和本校校全體師生、以及各位高級將領講話、在這整整一年當中、國家的危險、雖然加重、同時國家的進步、也很迅速、即就本校而論、今天我看見無論是學校的規模、敎育的成績、以及大家的精神體格、比去年巳經大不相同、進步很多、由此可知我們的社會國家各方面、也一天比一天、一年比一年進步、這是自已心裏覺得很快慰的一件事、去年開學的時候、我和大家講的是「為學州事與做人的基本要道」、因為這篇講話很重要、同時還有一般新考入本校的學生、沒有親耳聽到、所以今天先要就去年所講的意思、扼要的再和大家說一說、大槪去年所講最主要的意思、是說我們做了現在這個科學時代的－個人、無論求學辦事、立功立業、要希望有遠大的成就、必須了解科學的原理、發揮科學的精神、運用科學的方法、其是我們擔軍事政治敎育各種職務的一般同志、以及將要為國家做事業的一般學生、大家所應負的責任、就是「治國平天下」的大實任、大家所應做的事業、就是一治國平天下」的大事業、所以各學生到這個學校裏來求學、决不是為一身謀溫飽、為一家謀福利、而是為國家為民族創造光明遠大的前途、就目前而論、就是要將救國救民的責任、整個的放在自己的肩上、由我們大家擔負起來、我們所負的責任、既如此重大、如果不特別注重研究科學的原理和方法、怎麼可以擔當這個艱難偉大的事業、盡到我們所負治國平天下」的責任呢、不但不能負這個治平的責任、恐怕－件事也不能做、根木就不能成一個現代的人、關於科學的原理和方法、現在中外都有很新的書籍、闡述精宏、不勝枚舉、但是各位要曉得現代所謂科學、這一個名詞、所包含的意義和知識、并不是外國人所發明、更不是只有外國人纔知道我們中國的古人、早在數千年以前就很注重、不僅在實際方面有很多偉大的發明、就是在理論方面、也有最精微最廣大的闡述、其中最基本最精要的一部書、就是大學、我常說大學這部書、可稱為「科學的大學」、就是說大學的內容、完全是講科學的原理和方法、可以說大學就是基本的科學曁法論、我們無論要做人做事、非澈底領悟大學所講的道理、並且身體力行不可、尤其是我們一般同志和學生、負「治國平天下「之重大責任、將來要敎導國民、舉化民成俗之功、要治理國事、立繼往開來之業、不可不拿「大這種基本的學問、用俗話來講、就是我們成功立業的「法寶」、我們要立志做一番大事業、如果沒有一個「法寶」在手裏、心中便沒有把握、遇事沒有主意、如此不僅不能治國、連到自己一身一家也治不了、所以我們在學校裏求學、如果不懂做人和做事的基本方法、沒有一個安心立命之學來做根據、無論各門科學和技能、學得怎麼好、都沒有用、到最後都不能成、這是我去先就科學方面說明大學之道的崇高偉大、要大家特別注重研究的一段意思、其次再就哲學方面來講、去年我也同時提示了－個大意、哲學是我們人人必有的基本知、不懂哲學的人、一定不懂人是什麼東西、亦不懂人生的目的和做人的道理、根本就不知道做人、既不知道做人、無論是怎麼博的博士、有怎麼大的學問、也不能致用所以我們政治學校的學生、務必要注重哲學的修養、古今中外講哲學的書籍、浩如烟海、我們當然不能一一研讀、但是我們旣做了一個中國人、對於中國的哲學、不可不研究明白、尤其是大學中庸兩部書、實為中國正統的倫理和政治哲學之經典、格外非精研澈悟、身體力行不可、古今中外講哲學的書籍、每每不是偏於唯心、（精神）便是偏於唯物、（物質）其實精神與物質、原屬一體之二面、同物之異象、相因而生、相需而成、在本質上既不可分離、在學理上自不容偏重、尤其是我們一切學問、是為人生而學問、如果偏於唯心、必至於鑿空蹈虛、漫無歸着、偏於唯物、必至毀情滅性、由冷酷而流於枯槁、都是違反人生的真諦、所以我們中國的哲學、特別是大學中庸、所講的倫理和政治的正統哲學、「由格物致知誠意正心」、講到治國平天下、由「率性」「修道」、講到「天地位萬物青」、實為心物並重、本末兼資、精微開展、明體達用之最高尙、最完美、最正確的哲學、或者有人以為學庸所講、偏重於精神的修養、似為唯心的理論、其實不然、大學始言「格物」、中庸重在「時中」、就是注重客觀環境與－切客觀事物的意思、不過我們要做、要成功立業、要運用萬物與合理的適應和改造環境、當然要以精神的修養為根本、所以學庸在精神這一方面特別注重、總理在軍人精神敎充第一篇、在說明精神與物質不可分離、應當並重的道理之後、叉說「我既為「人」則當發揮我之精神、亦即所以發揮為「人」之精神、故革命在乎精神、革命精神者、革命事業之所由產出也」、這一段話與學庸的宗旨、完全一致、總理在三民全義中、也曾提到大學中庸所說的格物致知、誠意正心、修身齊家、治國平天下那一段話、把一個人從內發揚到外、由一個人的內部做起、推到平天下止、像這樣精微開展的理論、外國什麼哲學家都沒有見到、都沒有說出、這就是我們政治哲學的智識中獨有的寶貝、由此可見總理基本的思想完全是淵源於中國正統的倫理與政治哲學、即大學與中庸所講－貫的道理、這個道理就是我們修已治人、革命建國所萬不可少的基本學問、所以我希望本校全體師生、無論敎師施敎生求學、必須首先注重大學中庸之道、和總理遺敎以及戴季陶先生所著孫文主義之理論的基礎中所講的民生哲學、我們務必先立定這個根本的基礎、然後其他－切學術、才能實實在在為國家為民族而應用、一切革命的事業、也才有成功的基點、現在國內外大學畢業的學生、不為不多、其中真有學問和技術的也不少、但是何以大多數不能用其所學、發生救國的實效呢、依我的觀察、根本的原因、還是因為沒有注意中國的倫理和政治哲學、以及做人立業真正的道理、我們政治學校的學生、將來都要造成為政治建設和領導的幹部人才、今後要完成革命建設新的國上、如果我們也犯着過去很多大學生所犯同樣的毛病、只學一點學術技能、只為個人謀衣食求富貴、而沒有學得做人立業的大道、和基本學問、因而所學的東西、不能為國家為民族致用、那就不配做政治學校的學生、我們既做了革命的政治學校裏－個學生、就要懂得革命的政治哲學、既進了政治大學做了大學生、就不可不精研大學之道、就不可不力行大學之道、以上已就我去年所講的意思、再加闡述除此以外、今天還有兩點要緊的意、思想和大家說的、第一本校敎育的目的、是要造就革命的幹部人才、各學生除分別授以行政法律外交財政經濟敎育地政計政和合作各種必要的社會科學之外、同時並授以軍事學術、實施巖格的軍事管理、像這樣文武並重的大學、在中國算是獨一無二因此我們學校的敎育、應當要樹立1個文武合－的敎育之模範、這是本校全體師生所應當共同認識、一致努力、同時也很容易做到的一件事、今天我就是根據這個意思、再向大家介紹一部書、就是步兵操典、特別是最前面一篇步兵操典綱領、我們如果說大學中庸是政治的典範、同是也就可以說步兵操典是軍事的大學、尤其是最前一篇鋼領、就等於大學第－章經、所以各位軍事敎官、要敎授軍事學術、首先就要將步兵操典所綱領講的精義、傳授給一般學生、各學生要研習軍事學術、也一定先要將這篇綱領澈底研究明白、如若不然、我們敎官所敎、與學生所學的－切軍事學術、完全無用、而我們一般學生、如果不能澈底領悟步乓操典綱領、正如不了解大學第一篇、無論如何、不能成一個文武兼全的革命幹部人才、大家要曉得步乓操典綱領、並不是專講軍事、而是整個的講軍事政治和社會所由推動、與一切事業所賴以完成的精神、這個精神、就是軍事政治和社會的原動力、我們一定要澈底領悟步兵操典綱領的內容、然後才可以認識軍事與政治共通的原動力之所在、然後才可以造成文武兼全的革命人才、所以我今天特別介紹這部書、要大家視此與大學中庸並重、同樣注意研究、（未完）</p>

<p>激戰之初、往來穿梭、攻攻守守、各皆佳妙、因之難開紀錄者達四分時之久、在許文奎首先投中下、韓振元繼之建樹、童遇春功不後人、鄺耀雅豈肯甘　齊驅、並駕煞是緊張在韓振元轉土重來、一罰一投、乃形造出、嗣後雙方掙扎更烈、分數此進彼中、先演九對九、旣而又造成十四對十四之兩度平手、在惠培文奎左右逢源、優游再行登先、振元雖中一隻、上半時恰巳告完、優游以十七對＋六領前、</p>
<p>十分檸檬、戰端又啟、優游調動戰將、不料真如健兒急圖反本、－鼓作氣、全軍呼成一氣、鄺中鋒四投四中、顏連進又火中加油、王南珍蔡演雄等、均有貢獻、分數乃一洩二十里至三十之數、其間僅許文奎馬粹茅獲中兩球耳、嗣後優游復將原陣綫迎戰、局勢略形起色、相衡對抗之象、無如損失過巨、垂危之勢不能挽回一聲鑼鳴、時間告畢、真如以四七對三·之比奏凱、</p>

<h3>戰來一路順風　羣毅戰勝華威</h3>
<p>羣毅對華威之戰、在初之十分時內、頗形拮抗、嗣茲以後、羣毅攻勢雖屬仍頻、而華威之防禦力量、東欄西阻、甚為努力、故損失無多、以七對十六完結、上半時、易場重戰、華威軍情鬆懈、無前之週密、彼之華盧陶三鋒、屢屢探籃相持、雖有反攻時、但總是得不償失、結果羣毅以四八對十五得勝、</p>

<h3>兒童敎育小說（一七五）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄·譯</p>
<p>「我不願見他，見了他反到使他又要不舒服了；通知唐恩我留坦第托他照料罷了。你們大一些的孩子，我相信你們今天總會自己管理自己。拂朗會吩咐你們，還有賴司務在這裏照顧一切。所以我們晚上再會罷。」</p>
<p>當裴先生正急急忙忙再要奔出去的時候，愛彌留住了他，說道：「且告訴我們一些喬恩姨丈的事。」</p>
<p>「他只病了幾個鐘頭，他臨死的時候，正如他活着的時候，很愉快，很安靜，因此我們也不敢表劇烈的哀痛，免得損壞了他最後一瞬的美景。我們到的時候，還能送着他；的兩臂懷抱着小橋和小梅，同時就長眠在梅格姨母的胸上了。再沒有了，叫我怎能忍受呢？」裝先生說後，就急急走去，傴着背，若不勝其憂思，因為於喬恩柏魯客之死，他不但失去了一個好襟兄，也是失去了一個好朋友，更沒有人可以替代他的。</p>
<p>屋子裏整天很沉靜；小童子們守在育兒室裏安靜游戲；別的人，覺得彷彿一個星期的中間倒又來了一天星期日，便要想法子去消磨它，或閒步，或坐柳蔭眺望，或與其愛寵的動物嬉游，可是大家都常常談到「喬恩伯伯、」覺得溫良，正直，而又剛強一種不可名狀之物竟脫離了他們的小世界而去，只留着一種損失的感覺，竟與每個時鐘的過去而漸益加深。到了天將昏黑，裴先生和裴夫人獨自回來了，因為小橋和小梅現在正是他們母親最好的慰藉，當然不能離開她的。可憐的蜀夫人看去已乏極了，分明需要着同樣的慰藉，因為當她走下梯階的時候她最先的一句話是：「我的小竇寶在那裏？」</p>

<h3>人人都能救中國</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>所怕者是「非不能也實不爲耳—</p>
<p>說到「救國」，的確責任是多麼之重大喲？要是沒有高深的學問，沒有眞實的才能，要想救國，談何容易？</p>
<p>但是，要知道，國猶人也。人在病危的時候，如果能彀一方面保持元氣，一方面對症下藥，未始不可轉危爲安，起死回生。救國也是這樣，只要先明乎國危的癥結之所在。然後一方面保持元氣，使元氣不再有所損耗。一方面再對症下藥，補充氣血。救國何難？</p>
<p>良以我國今日之所患，是患在「財源枯竭」。正如一個人，患了「貧血之症」一樣，以致百病叢生。內憂外患，交相煎迫。爲今之計，唯有趕快一方面保其元氣，一方面補其血液。而保氣補血之道無他，唯有大家認眞的服用「國貨」！</p>
<p>我們知道，「服用國貨」，這是絕對自由的。旣無須高深的學問，又無須眞實的才能。只要有認識，有决心，肯認眞，人人都可以服用「國貨」，人人都能彀「國貨救國一。所以我要說：「人人都能救中國。」不過，所怕者是：「非不能也，實不爲耳！」</p>
<h3>參觀植物油燈之補充話</h3>
<p>中國油燈公司創製植物油燈，得各界一致贊許，紛紛發表美評，足徵遏止漏巵，挽回利權，具有同感。茲讀上期本刋喬耘飱君參觀植物油燈記，對於油燈式樣光亮，都表示滿意，並指示各點，使知改進，以一燈之微，而願見敎，幸何如之。我國煤油進口，年逾萬萬元，萬家燈火，無不仰給。吾人托生於帝國主義之燈光下，已非一日，而吾人之精髓，已被收吸殆盡矣。今鍾靈君發明中國油燈，利用農產植物油，不啻以國人自身血汗，燃點燈光，自力更生，無逾於此。現由本公司製造發售，因各方需求，急切先出壁燈檯燈二種，其他掛燈玻璃燈正在陸續趕製中。喬君所示各點，關於售價自當力求低廉，將來自二角起至一元左右，隨用戶之經濟力而異。且有用三分燈芯之燈，更可節省油料，並備各種使用簡圖及文字說明，隨燈附發，其他各點，已通知上海經理處益豐搪瓷廠。如欲參觀新出燈樣，請至山東路二一八號中國油燈公司爲幸。（中國油燈公司）</p>
<h3>國貨通訊（一）</h3>
<p>— 抱一</p>
<p>黃任之先生，最近有西蜀之行，溯江而上，由武漢，而宜昌沙市，而萬縣，而重慶成都，沿途考察，可謂壯游。臨行全國國貨聯合運動會，特委託黃先生將旅行所至，接洽國貨推行狀况，隨時通訊，此爲黃先生在武漢接洽經過情形，作第一决之通訊：（編者）</p>
<p>炎培與江問漁先生於二月二日抵漢口，即夜湖北綏靖公署，武漢警備司令部，漢口市政府，省市兩黨部，平漢路黨部六機關，公宴中國敎育學會同人，極一時之盛。席間綏靖何主任成濬致歡迎詞，炎培代表敎育學會致答詞。主賓兩方，均道及國難之嚴重，國民經濟力不振之原因。炎培因即附帶報吿上海國貨運動聯合會之組織與趣旨，不久將推員前來武漢，共同提倡。並特別注重家庭服用國貨，希望在座賓主兩方諸士女，努力倡導，皆大鼓掌，蓋在座有不少女士也。</p>
<p>同席湖北省立女子師範學校周世萬校長，述及武漢設有湖北省服用國貨委員會，各行政機關各社會團體皆有代表加入，地點在省立民衆教育館。此外有新生活婦女勞動服務團，省主席夫人亦加入，甚注重提倡國貨。省婦女服用國貨委員會，爲婦女提倡國貨之總機關。</p>
<p>六日漢陽周恒順機器廠主人周仲宣君，宴炎培及江君於漢口靑年會，同席三十餘人，多係工商界金融界領袖。炎培及江君先後報告中華職業敎育社近况，炎培道及職業敎育與社會經濟之關係，因報吿民國二十四年對外貿易統計之大概，與國貨提倡之必要。述及上海組織國貨運動聯合會，將劃定區域，合各地共同提倡。席間諸君紛紛致詞，如裕華紗廠董事長前湖北商會聯合會主席蘇汰餘君，漢陽商會主席周文軒君，印花稅局長楊聞泉君，上海銀行經理胡慶生君，全國民營電業聯合會主席水電公司董事汪書誠君，恒順機廠工程師周蔚柏君，省立工科職業學校敎務主任周杏村君等，皆有演說。前商會會長周韵宣君，中華大學校長陳叔澄君，前商會會長陳經畬君，武昌機廠廠長盧寗生君，亦皆出席，有主張提倡國貨，須政府與人民合作者，有主張改良國貨製造，須研究各地社會需要者，有主張社會領袖身先表率，使一般民衆纔知服用國貨爲榮耀者。在座周少夫人梁女士籍隸湖南，述湘省何主席鍵自辦公機關以至家庭，一概使用國貨，爲社會倡。而發言允警闢者，如某君謂提倡國貨，政府須和蘇俄一樣，以整個國力爲後盾。社會須和日本一樣，雖在國外，非其本國貨不用，國內更不必論。時空氣大爲熱烈，在座女士多人，表示俟上海提倡服用國貨諸女士到漢，當合力鼓吹倡導。故上海婦女界，應速組婦女服用國貨團。</p>
<p>武漢提倡國貨標語，隨處可見，亦有大規模之國貨商場，希望上海國貨輸往推銷也。（自漢口發）</p>
<h3>啓事</h3>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>國貨推銷團</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>陳蝶仙先生，爲國貨界老前輩，文章經濟，海內共仰。他老人家以六十許人，還不斷的努力於國貨事業；有空時候，還替上海機聯會「機聯會刊」做文章，他的文章，不是空話，也不唱高調，完全是指導靑年牛利之途，這是我們個個人都佩服他的。最近機聯會大會，他老人家提出了一個組織國貨推銷團的議案，主張由機聯會來做工廠與推銷員的中心。陳先生說：機聯會旣專替閱者設想，以謀救濟失業的恐慌，我所主張的國貨推銷團，是販賈任何一廠的出品，繳付若干押櫃去銷，雙方都是有利無弊的。不過任何一廠，都是做慣大批發的，對於這種事情，辦事員每嫌瑣屑，置之不理，有時介紹接洽，往往無人招呼　。如果由機聯會刋來組織，一定是根發達的。陳先生復親自說明種種辦法，有聲有色，博得全塲二三百人之鼓掌，可見國貨推銷團，是應運而生，同感切要的。所以上海職業指導所於去冬也是辦了國貨推銷團，分向各廠領了國貨，到各鬧市各鄉村乃至各家庭中儘量推銷，目下團員已有十五六人，很得各方的贅同，其中推銷最努力的，每天可有十餘元乃至二十餘元之營業。二月以來已爲各工廠推銷國貨二千餘元，無形的宣傳，還不在其內。現在一天發達一天，日內正擬擴大起來，作再進一步的工作，而注意於勸導與推銷。並知沈九成先生願任開辦一組五人之籌備費用。允爲敬愛。蝶仙先生此議，是發生於十年以前，可見他根據着營業經騐與辦事心得上來。不是尋常可比。最好兩個機關—職指所與機聯會—先自會商分工合作的辦法，俾國貨推銷日見擴大，國貨事業有繼長增高之象，同時還得注意的三端：　人品的選擇，　貨物的檢查，　推銷的研究。而允要者爲調查與利用機會，果能這樣，我想此後的國貨工業，或有「吾極泰來」「起死回生」的希望乎？</p>

<h3>經濟恐慌中金融界應有之責任　（一績）</h3>
<p>— 趙棣華</p>
<p>或以爲吾國入超雖巨，而無形收入，固未始非謀國際貸借平衡之一法，所謂無形收入者即不外華僑匯欵國際投資，及各國在華旅用費用、及駐軍費用三四項。至於他國所恃爲最重要之變形收入，如企業利息保險運費等，在我國可謂絕無僅有其中主要項目，如華僑匯欵，有估計爲年達一萬五千萬元者，有估計爲年達二萬萬元者、亦有估計至四萬萬元者。（一九三一年耿愛德氏估計）次之如外人在華投資，估計年亦有一萬萬元，合計其他收入，以抵補商品貿易之入超及其他國際貸借之收支，情形或較爲良好。姑無論上項估計數字之是否正確，然華僑匯欵之逐年減少，經濟不振，固屬事實。貿易入超之抵補，亦屬毫無把握。吾人觀一九三三年國際收支中生金銀之外流，亦可想像國際貸借情形之危機，無形收入之抵補，固未足以樂觀也。</p>
<p>入超問題，旣如是之嚴重，入超一日不得解決，國民經濟一日不得安定，而吾國之經濟恐慌亦將愈形劇烈。入超需如何而能挽轉頹勢，吾人以爲舍增加生產外恐無他法。</p>
<p>吾國麥豆生產統計，請目貿易統計以觀察生產品出入口之一斑。</p>
<p>近數十年來，吾國出入口商品性質之分類比較，出口以飲食物及烟草爲最多，原料及半製品次之，製造品第三。入口以製造品爲最多，飲食物及烟草次之，原料及半製品居三。歷年變動極少。近年以東北失陷，出口大宗之豆類雜糖，失去來源，出口方面，製造品居第一位，原料及半製品次之。二十三年之出口商品，製造品占百分之三十九，原料及半製品，占百分之三十二，飲食物及烟草占百分之二十八。二十四年上期，出品原料，及半製品居第一，占百分之三十七，製造品次之，占百分之三十二，飲食物及烟草占百分之二十九，入口方面，二十三年，製造品，占百分之四十九，原料及半製品，占百分之二十六，飲食物及烟草，占百分之二十一。二十四年上期製造品占百分之四十六，飲食物及烟草占百分之二十八，原料及半製品占百分之二十一。又自出入口商品比較，出口內以豆類生絲蛋及蛋產品棉花爲最多，豆類占百分之十以上。惟二十二年以東北失陷，豆類出口已一落千丈，生絲又居第一位。二十三年茶居第一位，棉紗蛋及蛋產品及貨棉花桐油次之。二十四年上期，桐油居第一位，占百分之七，三五，皮貨蛋產品茶花生生絲次之，入口商品素以棉花及米占最多數，常居第二位，占百分之十一以上，五金小麥棉布糖品次之。二十四年上期，進口洋米尤多，占百分之十四，五金棉花小麥次之，根據此種商品性質之分類比較及商品出入口情形，又可以窺見本國對外貿易之眞實情形，及國內經濟發展之狀況，至可以得下列兩種印象！</p>
<p>在商品性質分類比較內，飲食物原料品之占多數，爲吾國農產品輸出之表現，近兩年製造品雖居第一位，純爲一種特殊情形，日製造品內之皮貨，在吾國尙只能列爲原料及半製品，非如外國化學工業製造品之皮革可比，其他製造品，又僅能行銷南洋市塲，亦毫元固定基礎，自出口商品言，如豆類生絲茶蛋產品桐油花生棉花統計，幾占出口全部之百分之七十。故吾國雖未足爲農業國家，然以農產品出口謀國際貸借之平衡，固元疑義。農產品生產之發達與否，關係國民經濟　巨。然而農產品情形適得其反。姑勿論七十餘年來貿易內飲食物品之逐漸減低，已爲長期趨勢，足爲農產品衰落之表現，即就近年來五榖生絲茶棄生品等項重要出口觀察，亦已極度衰微。據社會經濟調查所之農產品輸出貿易指數，以民國十九年爲基年，二十三年，五榖頓落至二九·八三，二十四年十一月份，爲二八·七三，生絲落至三七·九三，蛋及蛋產品落至六八·四八，豆類落至三·五二，棉花落至五二·二二，總指數落至四二·九零。其中除五榖豆類不計，亦落至六四·七二。換言之即減落達百分之五十，而此數種農產品者，又全爲吾國國民經濟之命脈。此種農產品出口之不振。卽充分表現吾國年來生產之衰落不堪也。</p>
<p>人口商品情形，亦足以反映吾國國民經濟之盈虧及產業之興敗。入口內製造品之占最多數，始終爲吾國工業不振之明證，而飲食物及烟草之占第二位，尤足以表示吾國農業生產之衰敗。如入口最多之洋米棉花小麥三項，固無一非吾國出產最豐天賦獨厚之農產品，而仰給於外人者，如是其巨。米麥麵粉三項食糧，自歷年以來，入口逐漸增加，民國元年洋米入口，不過二百餘萬担，十年以後，增至二千萬担或一千餘萬担，小麥麪粉，亦同此情形。吾國對於食糧消費之主因，未見其增高，何以食糧陡增，且輸入情形，又爲一種無秩序之增減，自決非國內有一種固定之需要，其重要原因，不得不歸納於國內生產之衰落矣。</p>
<p>吾國貿易入超，及國民經濟沒落之原因，有事實上證明，當以國內生產衰落，爲最重要。故目前救濟問題自亦在增加生產。所謂增加生產者，一方面改良品質，規定品級，一方面增加產量，推廣市塲。在國內可以抵補非需要舶來品之輸入，在國外可以擴充　有地位出口商品之市塲，否則各國以我國爲傾銷　藪，將來入口增加，出口減少，入超將更趨嚴重。最近雖有新貨幣政策之實行，於出口貿易或可漸趨轉好，然根本問題，仍在本身生產力量之健全，此則在吾國金融界，在應共同努力者也。</p>
<p>（二）確定中心政策發展產業</p>
<p>金融界與國民經濟之關係，旣至爲密切故金融界所負之責任，亦至爲重大，欲減少長期之入超，彌補國際貸借之損失，非增加生產不可，而增加生產，又非金融界從事扶植不可。然則金融界對於國內生產事業，果未能盡輔助之職責耶，是不然。年來金融界之具有悠久歷史者，旣確能一洗往昔因循萎靡之舊習，而新近設立之銀行，亦能趨入正軌，竭誠服務。如工廠獎金之維持，國貨事業之扶助，商業放欵之擴充，農村放欵之舉辦，以及商業承兌票據小本貨欵等等，無一非直接間接促成生產事業之成功。若根據各銀行放欵統計，更可知金融業對於產業投資爲數之巨。</p>
<p>（根據財政年鑑各銀行資產負債表計算）</p>
<p>上表銀行一百十九家，資本二萬二千八百萬元，放欵總計爲十六萬萬一千一百五十萬元，放欵內無性質分析之資料，唯中國銀行二十三年義營業報吿，二十二年度放欵於農工商直接生產事業者，占百分之四十四左右，二十三年占百分之四十八，放欵於間接生產如交通公用事業者，占百分之二至三。假定依照中國銀行之比例，以百分之四十八放欵於農工商業，爲數可達七萬萬二千九百九十八萬餘元。</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>評「生活全國總書目」</h3>
<p>— 曾建屏</p>
<p>在中國這樣貧乏的出版界和讀書界中，買書的困難以及讀書的困難，早已成爲有目共睹的事。生活書店在這種氣氛之中，竟負起責任來編輯這一包含有二萬種書以上的「總書目，」這種有意義的勞作，是值得我們深深的贊服的。</p>
<p>雖然，編書目並不是一件容易的事，而編全國總書目更不是容易的事。可是這種不容易的事，目前竟由平心君做成功了，這眞不得不使我們益加欽仰。因爲欽仰兼爲着希望買些可讀的書，我終於把生活書店這一偉大的勞作—全國總書目粗粗地翻過。然而不幸得很，自以爲勝過某某目錄的全國總書目，卻只有失望，增加了不少的厭惡。過去曾經存着的期待的信今，在這里，是完全飛出我的大腦了。</p>
<p>我對於生活書店所出的「全國總書目，」其最失望的地方，不在於它分類方法諸問題，而是在於編書目者所附上的符號，的意見。編書目的平心先生，旣然是站在「希望全國有血性的著譯人文化人，團結在一條火線上，抗拒並擊退一切殭尸式的文化逆轉運動，掃盪各種卑劣的盜匪式的文化破壞運動…」的立場上，來「介紹國外有價值的名著；」來「選擇那值得一讀的讀物去讀，」以「贊助我們所當贊助的—進步的全新的文化；」那麼，照理對於一般的書籍的編輯與介紹，自應以「全新」的客觀的態度，來担負起拉　任務。可是，總觀該總書目的內容，則我們不能不嘆息編者是具着過份的成見。所謂「不論派別，惟以內容嚴正爲尙，」在平心先生這一本書中，筆者實未曾具體的看到。不僅沒有具體的看見，而且反而看到平心先生之任意標點，「私心」自用，不了解一般特殊專門讀物的性質。</p>
<p>何以說平心先生只是「私心」自用，任意標點呢？我們在他這一本書目中，可以看出許多的證據。</p>
<p>第一，是他雖然將各種各樣的書籍分爲三等。晚易閱讀的初級讀物是標梅花符號，最高級的讀物是標星形符號，中級的讀物是標空心三角形的符號。此外更規定世界名著之前面即標一黑色圓點，有問題的書，則標一黑色三角形的記號。但是，他的書籍劃分內容的標準，都是絲毫沒有嚴正的一定意義。例如他把辛墾書店所出版的「資本論大綱」列爲初級讀物，而把卿雲書店所出版的資本論（均是日人山用均著）則列爲高級專門讀物，（該書七七頁。）將新生命薩譯「馬克斯十二講，」列爲內容有問題及曲解的書，而將李權時的「經濟學ABC」不加折扣的編出。這樣的態度和立場，是不是嚴正及沒有派別的立場呢？這眞的有點兒令人難以了解。假使高畠素之的「馬克斯十二講」有點兒曲解，那麼，布哈林的「史的唯物論」以及德波林的「辦證法唯物論」便不是錯誤及不曲解嗎？所謂內容有問題，所謂書的高級及初級，究竟是以什麼做標準，這或者只有平心先生的「私心」曉得！</p>
<p>第二，有許多書籍是被編者列爲例外而不加以標示的。這種不加標示的內容，充分地表示了編者的無識及其黨派性。例如關於國民黨的著作，法西主義的著作，以及一般中國農村經濟，各國軍備狀況的著作，編者均沒有加上其所預定的符號。是不是上述的書均不可讀呢？還是上述的書均無難易之分？編者所以不願加上什麼符號的原因，大槪是在暗示讀者大可不必閱讀的意思。不然，何以在同一頁的其他的書偏偏加上符號，而上述的書却偏偏不加呢？</p>
<p>第三，我們在平心先生這一本「總書目」中，不僅可以看到他的黨派性，而且可以看到他的學問的平庸及無識。例如關於地質鑛物調查的書籍，編者却連一個符號也沒有。難道「南京龍潭地質指南」及「中國鑛產誌略」這一類的書，還分不出它的深淺及高低嗎？難道這些書也是不嚴正的嗎？</p>
<p>總之，平心先生所編的「生活全國總書目，」是站在推銷自己的書籍，搗亂讀書界的視野，以及無視科學的讀物的立場出發。從這種立場出發的「總書目，」你道還有他的眞實的正確性嗎？韜奮先生的隨筆的文章來說，這眞太過糟塌印刷所的紙張與購者的金錢了。尙何前進之可言。</p>
<h3>書店雜景（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>（十）　收稿</p>
<p>回過頭來，再來談談新書店出版方面的情形。其中最重要的自然是收稿是出書了。</p>
<p>各書店的收稿態度，頗有不同，大槪的說，在新書業發生的初期，各新書店大多是接受外稿的，有幾家，在開辦或擴充的時候，甚至像惟恐沒有稿件付印似的，收稿很濫。如華通及大東神州等，曾有一時期，大收稿件。所以這時，曾產生了大批以賣文爲生的「作家階級」，據說，當時還有人組織譯書著書的「托辣斯」，一本書，一個人譯十頁，二天便可繳卷，海上著名某「學者」，據說還組織過什麼學社，招請了一批失業的動筆桿朋友，給他私人譯書大量生產的某三角戀愛小說家，其作品是否完全親出其手，也普爲大家討論的有趣題目。有幾個作家，不但不怕稿子沒有出路，而且書店還須出錢預約，如郭沫若的稿費，千字均在十元以上，張資平也說，他的稿子非千字七元不售，懿歟盛哉，大量的「天書」即隨之出現。有許多社會科學名著都譯得使不懂原文的人，比讀原文還難懂，如史的一元論，經騐批判論等，即以中文的文字來說，有那一段是可以讀得下去的？但也因爲當時各書店收稿容易，乃有大量的賣文階級產生。時至今日，還有許多人互問：「在上海，單靠賣文可以生活嗎？」告訴你，朋友，這是歷史上的陳跡了。</p>
<p>這個景氣時代並不長。過後，各書局雖不如以前樣的盲目收稿，但收外稿的書店還是很多。賣文的朋友最感到興趣的問題是：一，這個書店是歡迎那類的稿件的，二，那個書店裏我有熟人以爲解決了這二個問題，收稿即有百分之九十的把握。因爲自己，亦曾在書店中當過小編輯，知道實際情形並不是這樣單純。關於第一個問題，如我們以前說過，因書店主持者觀念不同，各書店出書的方針固各有所偏，但這並不是說，你的書與他們性質相合，送去即可收下。反之，往往愈是方向相同的書送去，更會被退回。這不是奇怪嗎？因是：譬如某一書店比較，以中學生書籍出版爲多，則該書局對中學生書籍的出版必先有了較詳細的計劃，而且主持者亦必長於此道，你的稿子送去，未必適如他們計劃中所預定，而又感到缺少者，往往不是與他們已收或已約之稿相抵觸，即是與他們的觀念相衝突，你的稿件內容的好壞，還是第二問題。不信，你看，各書局中比較有系統的書箱，不是特約有關係者的譯著，而是外面偶然的投入者，共有多少？</p>
<p>關於第二個問題更是愚蠢。據說中國祗有一家最大的出版家，在過去，接受外稿，對於投稿者的「面子」是很有作用的。有時，這部稿子根本無用，但是你有「來頭」，他們也會把你接受下來，接受了後，可改的，他們的小編輯給你重改一遍出版，實在太糟了，付了稿費，束之高閣。但自受了一二八的砲火以後，這種情形已很少見。其他規模小的書局，除了那個盲目收稿時代外，因有熟人而接受你的稿子，這根本是夢想。因爲，那些小規模的新書店，決定稿子取舍的總編輯，大部是與書店有切身關係的股東之類，出版一本書，所費成本至少也得數百元，如你的書，在他們的觀念中，是不能賺錢的，人們肯單單爲了「熟人」的關係，而給你犧牲數百元嗎？</p>
<p>除了書業鼎盛的時期以外，各書店雖接受稿件，但都經過嚴密的選擇（大都站在生意眼上），接受稿件的方針，主要的不外兩種：第一，在他們預定的計劃之中者，第二，是書店主持者本身的稿件，普通的股東還是沒用。—不過，話又得說回來了，如你的稿件能適合該書店的出版方針，而又有熟人介紹，比較是好一點，這好處是他們至少要考慮一下，并且給你一個較快的答覆。</p>
<p>上述情形，還僅適用於新書業尙能維持的時期，至若新書業趨於崩潰的今日，這話又需加以若干的修正，你看，除了商務，中華，等三數家之外，誰還在繼續出新書？終算比較成功的新書店，如開明，新生命，生活，黎明等家，雖仍還有新書出版，但其數量較之以前爲何如？在這種情形下，自然賣文階級沒有了市場，必然趨於沒落了。</p>
<p>不過，這種打擊主要的祇是以賣文爲生的所謂文人或著作家而已，眞正有研究，研究並有新的發現與成績的學問家，影響並不多。這話怎說？很明顯，在中國前者與後者雖則同樣寫稿，而是有很清楚的區別的，那些賣文的著作家們，對於他所寫的東西，不一定有什麼研究，甚且他寫的什麼，自己也不能十分瞭解，不過爲了「賣」的關係，不得不抄一些英文日文之類的外國文工團，或東拼西湊的拉攏一些統計數字，組成一篇文或書樣的東西而已。中國今日現有的作家，大都是這樣的人，否則，在出版業相當熱鬧的過去數年中，何以像比較化了一些功夫，有一些新的發現的著作（內容正確性如何自當別論），如梁氏的先秦學術思想，胡氏的中國哲學大綱，等的書，還是這末少呢？至於眞有價值，及新的發現的學術專著，因爲數量根本不多，出路似亦不會因之斷絕的。</p>
<p>不過，就是那種賣文階級的文稿出路減少，站在出版界的立場說，自然也是出版界衰落的可悲現象。（未完）</p>
<h3>寫作與出版（續）</h3>
<p>— 伍蠡甫</p>
<p>但是，我們從他感受的印象是應該重新認識的。第一，我們不願意承認他便是頂上的貨色，我們寗可認爲藥鋪裏二號的或次等的材料。至於頭等的，現在並不是沒有，只不過桎梏所加，使作家沒法把它擺列出來。第二，我們認爲每種寫作都有它的廬山眞面，在出版後而改觀：降格，這當然不足以槪括那原來的精神態度。如今的作品，爲求發表起見，時常不免縮小，殘損，或弱化了自己，讀者貴能懸想寫作的整部，估計那「頂上貨色」所貶低的價值。第三，我們還須牢記，寫作是要收穫成效的，萬一遇到阻碍，仍須繞着曲線，迤　前進，即使成效，減低，總比沒有的好。所以像紀德式的思想，說它輭弱一點，固無不可，如果澈底排除，則又未嘗不是知識層的損失；如果要加非難，先須認識淸楚，負這責任的，有時也許是「出版」而不是「寫作」。</p>
<p>臨了，我們撇開出版方面的條件，來責備寫作，多少總忽視了現實的困難；并且，此中之有欠公道，也正如朱先生的囫圇方法，以及妄用一切「前進」，「落伍」等等的籠統斷語吧！</p>
<h3>怎樣看電影？（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳明毓</p>
<p>——評電影鑑賞法</p>
<p>商務「星期標準」書第十種</p>
<p>貝仲圭譯　（價八角）</p>
<p>當你從戲院裏出來的時候。縱然不覺得兩個鍾頭給糟塌了，但洋鈔冤枉地跳出了口袋是事實。這情形是常常有的。金錢耗費，時間損失，結果還得遭無聊乾澀底感覺痛苦。誰願意爲了尋求娛樂反惹了悶惱呢？</p>
<p>電影是一件新興的藝術，而且發展得非常之快的藝術。現是電影已成爲全世界大衆最普遍的娛樂了。這種階級性意味較薄，接近人生社會的各方面的藝術，沒有一層相當正確的認識與瞭解，不能不說是一個遺憾，電影鑑賞法（E　gar　Dale：How　to.　Appreciate　Mction　Pictures）被介紹到中國來，不能否認是件有意義的工作。</p>
<p>本書主旨，吿訴你怎樣去欣賞電影。它啟示你電影藝術的基礎知識，增進你的電影娛樂的領悟，養成你的鑑賞能力並提高你選擇影片底標準。而且，它還對你指陳電影的眞正目的與價值，對於未來的展望也建議了一個改革製產的計劃。</p>
<p>中國的電影觀衆對於銀幕鑑賞的水準一般是非常　落的。大部分人看電影，僅僅領會那故事的開展，看看那傳奇曲折底劇情。這是低級趣味的欣賞。眞正懂得電影神髓，會充分地鑑賞電影藝術的人，他不會忽漏了導演的手法，攝影的角度，動作的演出和聲音的合配等等。這些是表達影片內容所用的技巧，這等技巧可以將電影故事刻繪得生龍活虎般，使你隨着它的上下抑揚發出息息相連底眞實感！一個題材極凡庸的影片，如果導演的手法高明，鏡頭新鮮，表演眞摯，它也許不致被黜爲惡俗。眞實地說來，不懂得電影技藝的人，決不能充分瞭解銀幕上的故事和它深雋的逼眞性。</p>
<p>爲了要增加電影的鑑賞力，甚至僅爲了取得常識，我們對於電影有認識與理解之必要。譬如：演藝應該怎樣才算善美？這標準是須用角色的身分相稱，化裝滿意，理解劇情的透澈，情緒巧妙的描摹，演出的自然，性格的一貫，對話技巧的運用等尺度去定量的。這些尺度怎樣的使用，本書提供了詳細的具體法則，而且還舉了好些影片上的實例，使讀者可以很容易明瞭。</p>
<p>其次，在攝影方面它更吿訴了你許多智識。譬如電影的場面在某種情形之下，宜用某種的描寫。我們可以曉得偉大的遠景是當用遠寫的；普通的位置用近寫；至若要提醒觀衆注意的，則用特寫。還有由一幕進入他幕應該是「淡進」或「溶化」？光綫明暗的支配，角度大小的處理，如果這些你不完全是門外漢，那末在看電影的時候可以加增許多欣賞的資料。</p>
<p>還有，導演是一張影片的生命。導演成績的拙劣會把最佳主旨的劇稿破毀無遺；會使優秀的演員作出極壞的成績會擾亂全劇的節奏—簡直可毀壞善美娛樂條件的一切。「導演是一個電影的總紐」這話一點不差。但是中國的觀衆沒有人注意到導演。他們僅知道銀幕上的明星，盲目地贊譽，不知道生殺整部紅的生命的權威是在導演者的手中；更不懂得明星表情的演出是受着導演的控制。演員沒有靈活的技巧導演有方法補救，導演若缺乏機智的頭腦，這本片子無論如何就決定了它的命運。影片中每一部分都是經過導演的同意的。理想的導演是集合演員，藝術家，戲劇家，心理學家和技術的攝影家於一身的。但中國的觀衆大都不知導演是佔個什麼位置，是做着什麼工作，因之對於電影的理解，對於電影的鑑賞永遠就膚淺皮毛，把不到問題的核心。</p>
<p>本書對於導演的重要，有着扼要中肯的論述。關於佈景的功用，音樂對話的運用，電影故事的來源和優劣等也有明白的叙說。總之將攝制一個影片的經過剖析在你面前，讓你瞭解電影究竟是怎末的東西，使你增進欣賞的能力與興趣，這是本書的第一個貢獻。</p>
<p>第二，它使你審愼和恰當選擇你要看的影片。不少人看電影是全沒經過選擇的。「啊，我們看電影去吧！」好壞全靠運氣。普通的一般人則全憑廣吿，然而廣吿可以信賴得嗎？依據電影院的廣吿，沒有一個不是空前絕後的鉅製，沒有一片不是最高無上的傑作。你知道這是如何荒誕的欺騙。僅僅極少數的人才曉得應用報章上的電影評論。但影評也不是一個足恃的指針，它的批評不一定是正確的，尤其不是你自己的意見。你應該有自己的見解和尺度。有些人的選擇，是以贊仰的明星爲依歸的，然而這也常要失望。選擇電影不是隨便的事；如果你一次二次的去看那劣俗的影片，無異就在贊助它的滋長，結果貽害於社會。所以精密選擇影片不單自己不致上當，而且可以提高影片製作的標準，也就是說提高社會文化的程度。</p>

<h3>殖民地再分割</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰結束，凡爾賽和約締結之後，一般列強的外交家便奔走相吿，說黷武主義者已受裁制，從此可以永保和平，沒有殘酷的戰爭發生。這些勝利國家（英法美等）的爲政者，在犧牲了幾千萬頭顱之後，在他們已是「求仁得仁，」自然是希望世界無事，天下太平了。可是稍有世界知識的人，在那時卽早已認定：第二次大戰是必然到來。因爲帝國主義的存在，就在於殖民地原料供給商品銷售餘資投放這點來支持，然而在生產技術日益進步的現在，對於現有殖民地就很少有幾國是滿意的，因之爭奪殖民地，爲爭殖民地而發生火併，也便成了帝國主義的特性。</p>
<p>看罷，東菲黑人的遭遇，遠東黃帝子孫的身受，便是現實的說明。除開這兩國對殖民地已經開始「自由獲得」不說，現在重整軍備準備恢復第三帝國的　字黨徒，也一再的在那兒公開呌鬧，躍躍欲試。希特勒上月廿六日對　字黨大學生演說，謂歐洲國家有殖民海外之權，德國現已十分強國，無需國聯援助，且無需乎條約盟約，殖民地條以強權取得者，白種以其生活之豪邁觀念，定爲統治人物，此話殆已將國社黨於重整軍備後的心事，畢露無餘。上述不過僅就目前爭奪殖民地爭鬥之著者尤者而言，其他英美間在整個世界範圍內的攘奢，日美在遠東的對壘，英意在菲洲的短兵相接，在在都吿訴我們說，目前列強要的不是甚麼世界和平，而是世界殖民地的再分割！</p>
<h3>女孩兒的命運</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>父親銜着烟袋坐在過道口的門檻上，皺皺着臉，他的全副精神都給思索捉去。當他聽到屋里的嬰孩哭聲，輕輕的磕掉烟灰，把袋挿在背後腰帶上。兩隻冷手捫住頭，忽然左脚很重的踱了一下。一會兒他又展開了額頭的皺紋，顯而易見有種喜悅從他內心迸露出來了。他記起了宋四先生給他占過的「上卦」說是今年必生貴子。他立刻仄起耳朵聽着嬰兒的哭聲，彷彿一下子要辨別出是男孩兒聲，還是女孩兒聲。</p>
<p>收生婆丙午嬸笑嘻嘻的從院子里走來：</p>
<p>—樂全哥！你大喜啊！</p>
<p>父親一聽到丙午嬸來道喜，就滿臉噴笑，急促的問：</p>
<p>—是男孩嗎？</p>
<p>話一說出口，就竪着耳朶。預備着聽丙午嬸的回答。住了半嚮丙午嬸才　　的笑了兩聲。</p>
<p>—女的呀！挺胖挺胖的！</p>
<p>好像一座冰川從父親頭上倒下，他呆呆的站着，像一根石柱。丙午嬸很難爲情的走開了，在街上她吿訴福田老伯說：</p>
<p>「樂全嫂又來個閨女子，樂全哥氣楞了！」</p>
<p>嬰孩的哭聲挑起了父親的怒火，他踏進屋里灶問，忍無可忍的跳罵起來：</p>
<p>「又養個騷丫頭！」</p>
<p>我跟遜姊像兩隻小綿羊似的悄悄的伏在坑沿上，瞅着母親掉淚。</p>
<p>不管父親怎樣跳高，怎樣怒罵，母親祇是哭泣，一聲也不回答。以前她吿訴過我們，她乍嫁父親時，常吃祖母的氣，當她生下我大姊嫻子時，三天的工夫祖母不給她東西吃，祖母說，「媳婦生閨女子就不是好東西！那都是前世造下孽，這輩子才生閨女子！」</p>
<p>「你讓我把這條命送給這些騷丫頭嗎？想想，這些賠錢貨養大了於你有好處，還是於我有好處！祖宗留下的幾畝地我得保住，可是你這敗家精，光養這麼些騷東西，簡直要把我吃得精光！」</p>
<p>母親哭出聲了，我和遜姊也被父親的怒罵嚇哭了。</p>
<p>梅子妹妹拿着一把葱打外邊跑回來，沒進門就在院子嚷着：</p>
<p>「姐姐！俺有葱！」</p>
<p>一過門檻看見父親在發氣，嚇得溫溫馴馴的，兩隻小眼睛直瞅着父親的臉</p>
<p>「兎崽子！又上園去拔葱！」父親一巴掌把梅子打倒在地上，她哭着呌媽！</p>
<p>「窮該啦！沒法治！」父親最後喘了一口粗氣，又是氣忿又是憂愁的走出去啦。</p>
<p>母親被埋在哭泣里，她不給嬰兒奶吃，她打算永遠不給嬰孩吃奶，她得把那小動物活　生的餓死！那或者可以減輕她男人對於她的壓迫！「眞的！祖宗所遺留下來的產業我們要是保守不住，簡直是造孽！祖宗的陰魂可以來折磨你！呌你死後上刀山，下十八層地獄！」她從降生到現在自信沒有造過罪孽，婆母在世的時候，無論怎樣虐待她，她從沒有絲毫反抗和掙扎，她立志要做到「賢媳」的地步。對於自己的男人永遠是依依從從。</p>
<p>晚上父親沒有吃飯，臉上堆滿憂愁，烟袋不離嘴，惟有抽烟是他唯一的安慰。他依鍋台蹲着已有個半時辰啦，不言也不語。母親在坑上爬起她的產後的虛弱的身子，探頭從壁窗窩向外間看了看被拋在苦慮裏的父親，她的情感再也支撑不住了，她的眼淚很快滴下，用了哭啞的嗓子說：</p>
<p>「難道我不想來個男孩嗎？那是我們的命！命中注定的！」</p>
<p>父親並沒做聲，似乎覺得母親的話很有道理？他把烟袋錫兒在鞋頭上敲着，眉毛幾乎兩顆擠在一起了。</p>
<p>嬰兒張着柔嫩的血紅的小嘴，哇哇的直哭，母親却硬着心腸，不給她吃奶，但是熱淚却不斷地從母親的眼中滴到嬰孩的臉上。</p>
<p>屋子是滿裝憂鬰的氣氛，煤油燈閃着微光，彷彿牠也爲主人而不快！梅子連衣裳都沒脫，就睡到坑西邊，手中還拿着一塊沒有吃完的涼白薯。</p>
<p>半夜裏母親又哭起來，她坐着，父親靠窗臺欹着，嘴裏抽着烟，眼瞅着壁窗窩裏的燈光。嬰兒直僵僵的躺在母親眼前，死了！可憐的剛生下不久的小動物終於被餓死了！</p>
<p>——天老爺！再不要呌我生女孩子吧！——母親看看父親，再看看嬰屍，沙着噪子這麼呌着哭着。</p>
<p>父亲的烟代鍋裏閃着紅光。</p>
<h3>喪事</h3>
<p>— 禾金</p>
<p>「家有喪事，暫停營業」的字條在祥康襪廠的門前貼出來的時候，彷彿戰爭的謠傳似的，全城和祥康有關係的客家，錢莊都騷騷然地恐懼着祥康襪廠會和老闆朱崇康同時死去一樣，在午牌時分，那些經理，當手，都不約而同的到祥康襪廠來了。這在朱崇康的家屬是想不透的，祥康襪廠這二年來的營業慘敗，雖然連這所他手創的事業襪廠地基生財等一切抵押乾淨，但是債權人常常不肯放過朱崇康偶然做到一筆小生意而讓他手里留一點現欵。去年結賬時候，朱崇康幾乎整整半個月藏在廠里最隱暗的小樓里不敢見人面，大年頭就害起病來，沒有請得一個醫生，一星期光景，這位以經商起家的朱先生終於負了不能數計的債務溘然長逝。但是在家屬們籌議着入殮費用的時候，有那末多的賓客上門弔奠，朱崇康的兒子就哭喪着臉想在父執面前商討這一筆錢了。</p>
<p>朱崇康的屍體已經抬到正屋來了，但是賑房里甚至沒有買一付香燭的零錢，那些經理，當手一方面果然用憫憐的口吻和廠里的幾位先生敷衍着，他們的目光或許在估計全廠的市價了。當朱崇康的兒子說出要求幫助這一筆最後的費用時，每一個債權人都虎起了面孔，如果朱崇康的屍首還能開口的話，或者會整隊的擁進正屋去了。</p>
<p>祥康襪廠的經理，是朱崇康遠房的姪子，他爲着伯父的事業，是全廠最盡力的一個人。當祥康廠初創的時候，全城有同業七八家，由於經理先生的努力籌劃，祥康襪廠用侵略的姿態漸漸把它們併吞了。在城南購置田地，建造廠屋，添闢了水汀燙襪間，廠里的搖紗機日夜不息地響着，整數的裝襪箱每天運到船埠頭去。但是滬戰發生了輪船停駛輪，客家寗願放棄定洋不願冒着更大的危險來出貨，整批的襪箱在廠里堆積起來。依經理先生的意思馬上停工，看看風色再作道理。因爲卽使滬戰立時停止，這些存貨可以應市了；祥康設備週全，幹幾個通宵工是可以接貨的。但朱崇康不肯這樣做，他的見解是，滬戰是幾天之內就能停止的，廠里的存貨，客家都付過定洋，要是有新定戶來，我們拿什麼來應付呢，但是滬戰延長了幾個月，停戰以後，各項營業一落千丈，整廠的現貨不能換得一個現洋，各家來往錢莊都透支了很大的數目。固然以祥康這樣的局面，祗要營業一有起色是毫無問題的，然而洋紗　銷，市面却愈見壞下去伯姪兩個在這樣的狀態下，終於沒有辦法來維持殘局了。因爲債權人方面的一個消息，要　合控訴，拍賣廠屋，淸理債務，朱崇康是爲祥康而生，爲祥康而死了。</p>
<p>現在屍體是　在正屋里，債權人們已經透露出他們要發行法律上的權利了，姪子經理先生是知道後得明白的，他憂急伯父的屍骨沒有人殮，一方面他是經理，他要想一個萬全的辦法來穩住那些滿屋子的債權人的，終於他把歷年的賑薄　了出來宣吿破產，他嗚　着當衆說：</p>
<p>「我的伯父死了，祥康宣吿破產了，一切由你們的處置吧。我要料理喪事…。」</p>
<p>沒有說　　，他　上帽子走了。</p>
<p>屋里留下一個像呌貨　　樣騷亂的狀態：</p>

<h3>聖地</h3>
<p>— 江天</p>
<p>G山已经成爲S市的唯一的聖地了。</p>
<p>在二十年前，那還是一片荒涼的山野，生活在上面的，是終年終日在海中漂蕩着的漁人，他們在叢林之中建築了他們的家，在江邊的沙灘上做作着他們的生活。可是自從了S市的繁榮，他們的一切在無形中最被侵襲了，被奪取而犧牲去了他們的祖業。</p>
<p>S市，在南國的海邊，在今日已經是一個近代的繁榮的都市了。然而荒蕪的G山，也與S市一樣的繁榮了。</p>
<p>當着輪船進了T灣，在外來的旅客們的眼中，就會呈現出一幅美麗的風景。中間是一脈桃紅色的江流，右邊的岸上，是一望遼遠的平原，S市的近代的建築好像是連綿的山峯竪立在江邊。海關的鍾塔顯露出它的偉大在批示着人類的時間。對峙在江的左邊，却是另外的一個世界，一片靑綠的山峯，剛嶙高聳的與雲在接吻，在碧綠的顏色中，浮現出白色的莊舍。偉麗而端莊的聖地，就寄存在那綠色的山的環抱中。</p>
<p>柏特利敎堂的雄偉壯麗，二十年來，已經是成爲S市的居民所崇仰的聖地了。當着你走近了它的雪白的石階之前，仰望着峯尖上的敎堂，就會感到人類的渺小而想像着主是多麼的莊嚴和偉大了。</p>
<p>在G山上，除了柏特利敎堂之外，羅列在叢林的四方的，還有着醫院，修道院，學校，墓塲以及無數的堂皇的住宅·假如是一個外來的遊客，踏上了G山的兩旁夾着多年的松柏底道上，觀望着四方的美麗建築，他是會處處的感到這是瑞士的國土，是美麗的花園，而以爲自己是走進了天國了。</p>
<p>歐化的滋味和淸靜的情趣，在山道之上，是會到處的顯露着，當著夕陽西下，無數的異國人們和我們的高貴的同胞，在金色的光輝中慈祥的緩步着，快樂的歌唱着。在每當星期的時候，那更是變成了一個熱鬧的地方，在松林的C上，善男信女，是成羣集隊的排列着。呀！眞是偉大的聖地。</p>
<p>主是和平的，慈愛的，純潔的，可是人類却是兇猛的，刻毒的，污穢的。在這偉麗蔚嚴的聖地上，人類却給它加上了無數的污點了。</p>
<p>在二十年前，人們是把它作爲侵略的工具，可是在二十年後，却變成爲奪利謀財的武器了。二十年前漁人們的祖父遺傳下的荒山，漁人們的快樂的家鄉，在二十年後，雖已變成爲了主的聖地，變成了近代的美麗的花園。可是它却給人類造下了無數的罪惡；愚者是被侵略而信奉了，慧者却用之而牟利。聖地，聖地，不過是我殘酷的殺人的武器吧了。</p>

<p>阿巧：（敲門聲甚急）王大嫂子，王大嫂子！快開門呀！</p>
<p>王大娘：來了，來了！誰呀？巧姑娘吧？</p>
<p>（開門）你哥哥跟小魯呢？</p>
<p>阿巧：堤岸要決口，他們去搶險去了，老王走了沒有？王大伯呢？</p>
<p>王大娘：老五早走了，大伯到縣里去了。</p>
<p>阿巧：前村的堤岸要是堵不了，大水不是馬上就要沖下來了嗎？</p>
<p>王大娘：老五走的時候吿訴我，讓我等你大伯一回來就先到船上去等他們，等會我們就一塊去吧。</p>
<p>阿巧：大伯要到什麼時候才能夠回來呢？</p>
<p>王大娘：他早就走了，他到縣里去打聽官兵修堤的消息去了。</p>
<p>阿巧：到底官兵他們幫助不幫助老百姓來修堤呀？他們不是收了我們老百姓的什麼保衛團的捐嗎？</p>
<p>王大娘：聽說有的地方官兵，也替老百姓來修堤的，那也不能一槪而論，可是前邨的堤就沒有看到官兵去幫過忙修呀！</p>
<p>阿巧：那麼他們收了我們的錢幹麼呀？（狗叫）有人來了吧？</p>
<p>王大娘：讓我出去瞧瞧，（開門，雨聲，風聲，狗叫）</p>

<p>老天爺呀！還是讓我們死了吧！活着受罪更難受呀！</p>
<p>王大娘：（關門）巧姑娘，不得了啦，逃難的人越來越多了！</p>
<p>阿巧：那怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>王大娘：你大伯到現在還不回來呀！</p>
<p>阿巧：他老人家幹麼跑到縣里去呀？</p>
<p>王大娘：他是一村之長呀，這是受了衆人的委託到縣里去請願的！</p>
<p>阿巧：他老人家平常就愛多管閒事，所以才做了什麼縣的邨長！</p>
<p>王大娘：是呀，邨長又不是做官，有的時候還要自己貼錢，他倒挺高興的。</p>
<p>阿巧：我不是瞎說八道，水災的情形這樣危險恐怕他們早就比我們先跑了吧？</p>
<p>王大娘：這話誰說得定呀！（風雨交加！）</p>

<h3>「春之花」之歌</h3>
<p>— 羅宮</p>
<p>…參觀拍攝記…</p>
<p>這個攝影場裏展開着二個世界，一面是春水湖邊，細柳在月色裏輕拂，湖裏的光波悄悄地在閃爍。另一個世界是銀色的世界，白雪籠罩了整個原野，壓着枯樹，壓着一個鄉村的小屋，點綴着這幅素淡的圖畫。</p>
<p>導演吳村，和一隊音樂師陸續地到來了，今天拍的是那個「春水湖邊」的場面，嚴月閑要在這個詩情的境院裏唱一個美麗的歌「春之花」。</p>
<p>水銀燈一個一個完了，一道一道的光交織着這個美麗的場面，湖裏的水波漾了，天空裏的月亮亮了，柳枝輕輕地拂動了，看嚴月閒唱那個春意的歌，她是那樣快樂地，聽那個醉人的歌聲，那個歌詞是：</p>
<p>「一夜東風將春吹到」，曉起黃鶯頻報，且聽迎春調。</p>
<p>「本來誰耐霜寒峭料，幸虧春光來到，管敎人歡笑」。</p>
<p>「花色嬌，花容俏，輕風細雨它影搖，籬內人看簾外花，簾外花映如花貌。」</p>
<p>「花枝裊，花韻妙，粉蝶啼鳥花前笑，前知春色將人撩，偏愛春花兒人笑。」</p>
<p>（白：「時光跑得眞快啊！你看，茶　開了，春光老了，百花了一齊凋謝了，我的滿腔春意春愁，怎樣消除啊？你吿訴我吧！你吿訴我！」）</p>
<p>「未曾送春，春已去了！葵花無計添煩惱，春恨實難消！」</p>
<p>「無情想思，偏來相擾，憔悻落花逐水飄，如何度春消？」</p>

<h3>袁美雲男裝省祖</h3>
<p>—韓蘭根滿臉雞屎—</p>
<p>南洋華僑姜修，雖身擁咨財百萬，然膝下僅祗有一個女孩子，故每以沒有兒子爲生平憾事。惟差虧這個女孩子袁美雲生得天眞伶俐，善體人意，姜修便也愛若掌珠，視同男兒了，</p>
<p>姜修的父親王桂林，住居祖國，因爲年老，望孫心切，故寫信促姜修携孫子歸。因爲他老人家心目中的袁美云是一個男孩子的。其原因，乃係十八年前當袁美云出生的時候，姜修爲了安慰他老人家的緣故，　報生的是男，姜修本來以爲到將來，總有一個男孩子的，現在旣沒有，於是不得不叫袁美云扮男裝，暫時矇混一下。</p>
<p>果然，袁美云在改裝一下，誰還曉得是一個女兒呢？她的風流的舉止，爽利的言語，不是一個翩翩佳公子嗎？</p>
<p>到了中國，親戚友月之間，自有一番熱鬧，王桂林更是有說不出的欣喜，並且特備了盛大的筵席，爲她洗塵。</p>
<p>袁美云的堂兄韓蘭根，是一個貓般貪嘴的人物，雖然身貴爲富家公子，但猶常常在廚房里偷東西，這一天他看見廚房裏放着一大籠雞鴨，更是饞涎欲滴，歡喜若狂；於是他是那麼手舞脚蹈地掀起那只雞　　頭就抓了，那知這一來，籠中的雞鴨便好像恢復了自由的囚人一樣四面亂飛，一間窄狹的廚房裏，在其搗毀得杯盤狼籍，無一處乾淨地了。韓蘭根生性本極呆傻，見此情形，竟束手無策，於是給雞毛鴨毛雞屎撒得滿頭滿臉。</p>
<p>這是　華公司攝制，方沛霖導演「化身姑娘」中的情節一段，故事極盡纏綿悱惻，輕鬆而有趣哩。</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Concentrate Will</h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department's Announcement to the People of the Country was already carried in yesterday's issue of this newspaper, summarizing the full text. It is not only appropriate and detailed regarding the main point of "Concentrating Will to Overcome National Crisis," which is sufficient to show the correct path to national salvation, but also sincerely advises those who are driven by enthusiasm and are in danger of being exploited. Besides hoping that patriotic people will read this and have a realization, we will also discuss how this matter of concentrating will can be realized based on what we have seen.</p>
<p>First, the current national crisis is entirely from external sources. If we want to save ourselves, the entire country must be united to confront the external forces. This principle is very simple and should be understood by the general public. In the midst of stormy waves, if the people in the same boat first cause chaos themselves and want the boat not to capsize and their own bodies to be spared, how can that be possible? If we understand this, then in today's critical and existential situation, if someone is still taking the opportunity to agitate and disrupt domestic order, that person either lacks understanding of the meaning of national survival or fails to clearly recognize the current stage of China's national crisis. Therefore, if we want to realize the concentration of the will of the whole country, we must first make these people dispel their confusion and thoroughly understand their past mistakes in order to embark on the correct path to national salvation.</p>
<p>Second, the people of the country are frightened by the urgency of the disaster, and their psychology is different from the ordinary. Their emotions are undoubtedly激越(激越 is a hard word to directly translate in this context, but implies something like roused or agitated). If their actions are not calm and moderate, they can easily be agitated and used. If they are牵引(qian yin in this context implies something like bound or constrained) by the environment and are not careful, those who are saving the country may even turn to harming the country. Now the central government clearly states that it "knows that its responsibility is heavy and dare not neglect it slightly, and swears to boldly advance on the basis of its doctrine. Its only goal is to seek independence and equality for our nation externally and to seek self-reliance and self-strengthening for our country internally." The heart of saving the country is the same for all people. Reading this announcement should establish common trust. Once common trust is established, the concentration of will can be realized.</p>
<p>Finally, the central authorities "deeply know that only by actively preparing to gather the human and material resources of the whole country to form a great overall strength can we save ourselves and seek survival." Unless someone can stand on the opposite side and prove that saving the country does not require preparation and that not gathering can seek survival, then it is a pity that enthusiasm is misused. The results of the past disunity of domestic will have invisibly weakened the national strength and increased the national crisis. The facts are clear and not difficult to review. In this crisis, the people of the country should learn from the harm of past disunity, and then focus their will on the major goal of gathering strength and preparing to save the country. We are giving others an opportunity and unknowingly becoming sinners of the party and the country.</p>
<p>In short, in terms of the overall situation, the concentration of will is the fundamental basis for gathering strength, and the steps for saving the country must not be disrupted. In terms of the individual, rash actions are likely to be counterproductive and not beneficial to the country, which is especially not worthwhile. If enlightened people can understand the hard work of the party and the country in saving the country, then the matter of concentrating will will not only be seen in words today, but will also be seen in deeds in the future.</p>

<h3>$9 Million Worth of American Gold Shipped to China Purchased by the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Washington: Officials from the Department of the Treasury here stated that the $9 million worth of gold owned by the government here has now been credited to the account of the Central Bank of China.

<p>Paris: The Economic and Financial News Agency recently announced that the United States has shipped $9,970,400 in cash for export. This large sum of cash was originally deposited by a certain foreign issuing bank and was shipped to China with a special permit.

It is generally believed that the United States previously purchased a large amount of silver from China in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act, and the cash being shipped is to pay for the silver. Previously, the United States increased the price of silver, which affected China's economic situation, and people in the country complained. The government also protested to the United States. Now that the US Treasury Department is shipping cash to China, it shows its willingness to assist China in reorganizing its currency system. (12th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Artistic Musings</p>
<h3>Photography and Painting</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>A friend resolutely spent a hundred gold coins to buy a camera and enthusiastically engaged in photography. After fiddling with it for a while, he was greatly disappointed, abandoned the camera in a basket, and dejectedly came to me to tell me about his failure. He said:</p>
<p>"I was driven by a kind of dream to buy this camera. My dream is like this: I am very enthusiastic about sketching and always carry a sketchbook with me. Whether at home, at school, on the road, or in a vehicle, whenever I see painting materials, if there is a chance to sketch, I will definitely record them in the sketchbook. However, the opportunity to sketch cannot always be obtained. Because even though it is called 'sketching,' it still takes a few minutes. And the phenomena before my eyes are often changing and uncertain, unable to serve as a model for me for a few minutes. So I often let go of good painting materials because I don't have time to sketch, which I find very regrettable. At this time, I had not learned photography and, based on superficial imagination, thought that the photography of a camera only takes a few seconds, or even half a second, which is much faster than the 'sketch' of painting. With this machine, I can definitely collect more kinds of painting materials. Moreover, many dynamic states, such as the postures of athletes competing, the movements of a dog's feet, the scenes of butterflies flying, etc., are mostly difficult to sketch and difficult to remember, which is a difficulty in collecting painting materials. I thought that with a camera, I can freely capture instantaneous phenomena and obtain many precious painting materials.</p>
<p>"Driven by this beautiful dream, I resolutely bought a camera and asked someone to guide me on how to use it. After spending several weeks and several dozen rolls of film, I finally learned how to take pictures, and at the same time, that beautiful dream failed. Because 'it is difficult to know without experiencing it,' I used to think that a camera could freely capture phenomena anytime, anywhere, but in reality, it is not so convenient. First, it requires light. In places with weak light, half a second is not enough, and moving phenomena cannot be photographed. Under the lights or in the moonlight, even a few seconds are not enough, and people cannot be photographed, only still life or landscapes can be photographed, and even landscapes with wind-blown grass cannot be photographed. Second, it requires distance. For phenomena within twelve steps, you must first measure the number of steps between the phenomenon and the object with your eyes, and then shrink the lens to that number of steps before you can take the picture. Otherwise, the phenomenon will be blurred. Third, it requires aperture.... There are also various techniques and skills that I have not fully learned. Therefore, even if the light conditions are satisfactory for the painting material I discover, I still have to open the lens, prepare the switch, correct the distance, and consider the aperture before taking the picture. The time spent is not much different from sketching, and the procedures are actually more cumbersome than sketching. After taking the picture, unlike sketching, it cannot be immediately appreciated by others. You have to take the film to a special darkroom to develop it. After developing, fixing, and rinsing in clear water, you grope under the dim red light for a long time to get a negative that is black and white reversed. After waiting for the negative to dry, you go to the darkroom again to steal out photographic paper, print, develop, and fix. Only at this time can you see something like a painting in the clear water basin. However, out of ten, eight or nine are not like paintings; the one or two that are like paintings are only one or two parts like paintings. Therefore, I was greatly disappointed and abandoned the camera in the bamboo basket, treating it as a valuable and exquisite toy. When I am in the mood, I occasionally take it out to play with, but it has nothing to do with my painting life. My dream has completely failed."</p>
<p>His telling me this was to ask me to explain and comfort him. So I told him one by one the differences between photography and painting, the inability of the two to imitate each other, and the respective missions of the two in art, so that he would know how to correct his dream and how to handle his camera. What I said was:</p>
<p>Painting and photography are two completely different things. The difference between the two can be said that painting is the art of the eye and hand, and photography is the art of the lens and film. The beauty of the art of the eye and hand is artificial! The beauty of the art of the lens and film is mechanical. In the former, subjectivity is greater than objectivity; in the latter, it is the opposite, objectivity is greater than subjectivity. Although painting also describes the images of objective objects, it is filled with careful management of the mind and the activities of the wrist, just like writing, each person has his own brushwork, clearly expressing each person's personality. Therefore, if several people sketch the same model, the works they produce will have very different tastes. Although photographic techniques vary from person to person, the differences in technique are only in framing, lighting, and printing. The image of the objective object is always objective. Therefore, if many people photograph the same object, the results will be largely the same, and the difference will definitely not be as divergent as painting. When Western painting first entered China, general shallow Western painting believers were constrained by realism and almost wanted to replace their eyes with lenses and do artificial photography. (Even today, general low-level Western painting learners are still doing such dead work.) When artistic photography first emerged, general untrained photographers competed to take blurry scenery and soft tones to pretend to be Impressionist paintings. Both of these have not understood the unique characteristics of painting and photography and want to use painting to imitate photography or use photography to imitate painting. Recently, artistic photography has gradually improved and is no longer imitating Impressionist paintings as before. In magazines and exhibitions, there are often many photographic works by masters that can fully exploit the skills of the lens. These works are different from painting in their interests and have a unique aesthetic value. Conversely, in the art world, it seems that it is not as advanced as photography. Paintings that imitate photography are still welcomed everywhere today. Examples include calendar posters, charcoal portrait paintings, and cigarette cards.</p>
<p>The beautiful phenomena in the world can be divided into two types. One type is naturally beautiful and does not require artificial arrangement. Just try to preserve it as it is, and it will have artistic value. The other type has the possibility of being beautified, but it can only become an artwork after artificial management. The former is suitable for photographic expression, and the latter is suitable for painted expression. For example, the beautiful shadows under sunlight, the patterns of clouds in the sky, the patterns of water on the beach, and all naturally beautiful phenomena in nature are good subjects for photography. As for plum blossoms conveying the news of spring, flowers that seem to understand language, birds that seem to understand human feelings, naturally formed scenic spots, and all idealized realms that require artificial selection, addition, deletion, deformation, and configuration to give people aesthetic feelings, they are all good subjects for painting. It is difficult to do well and unrewarding to use painting to express photographic subjects. It is impossible to use photography to express painting subjects. Therefore, the two cannot replace each other. In summary: It is the skill of photography to be subtly lifelike with nature; it is the skill of painting to change and transform according to human intentions. The former is the "reproduction" of beauty, and the latter is the "expression" of beauty. Since ancient times, those who have discussed art have often looked down on reproduction and valued expression, thinking that the former is the work of drawing a gourd and has no artistic value; the latter is based on vitality and the movement of emotions, which is life-giving art. I think this statement cannot be generalized in modern times. When it comes to the value of art, photography is naturally inferior to painting, but photography is indeed qualified as an artwork. Because, firstly, as mentioned earlier, there are indeed beautiful scenes in the world that are suitable for photographic expression. In today's era of developed machinery, why not use machinery in art? Secondly, subtlety and lifelikeness, the art of reproduction, best fits the aesthetic eyes of the general public. Using this as a precious raft to guide the general public into the world of beauty is also extremely meaningful in culture and art. Therefore, I advise my friend not to hope to imitate painting with photography, nor to treat the camera as a toy. Understand the difference between photography and painting and treat photography as a new art in the mechanical age.</p>

<h3>Bitter's Anti-Japanese Remarks Deeply Sympathized with by London Coincide with General Sentiment Sufficient to Alert Japan Conservative Party Members Tend to Be Anti-Japanese and Pro-American</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman delivered a speech in the Senate, harshly criticizing Japan's policy towards China. Most people in political circles here believe that Pittman's speech may be sufficient to alert Japan and are therefore quite welcome. However, officials do not place too much emphasis on it, believing that its nature is only to express anti-Japanese sentiments and it cannot be concluded from this that the United States will take strong action to prevent Japan's outward expansion from overstepping its boundaries. Well-informed sources here also acknowledge that the United Kingdom itself has not found a way to resist Japan, so the United States cannot possibly take strong action. Although American public opinion has repeatedly reacted to and protested against Japan's progress in controlling China, it is still just empty talk. Pittman's speech is probably just one of these reactions. Some observers believe that Pittman's speech coincides with the general sentiment in London. In recent years, most people in the United Kingdom no longer support Japan's policies. Even Conservative Party members who do not usually support Japan have now changed their attitudes, either hesitating, feeling disappointed, or even expressing opposition, especially the right wing of the Conservative Party. These people have now turned pro-American, and their slogan is, "Looking at the world, there is only one country that Britain is worth making new commitments to, and that is the United States."

<h3>Americans Believe Pittman's Remarks No Less Than a Warning to Japan Treaty Rights Should Be Respected Otherwise, There is Only Recourse to War</h3>
<p>Washington: Some people here believe that the speech delivered by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman to the Senate yesterday not only warned Japan that the United States cannot remain neutral in the event of a war in the Far East, but also announced to the world that although American public opinion advocates neutrality, it still insists on respecting treaty and commercial rights. Senator McReynolds of the Foreign Relations Committee declared today that no one can interpret the United States' neutrality law as an expression of the United States abandoning its commercial and treaty rights in any part of the world. We insist on these rights, but when we will resort to war to defend these rights is up to us to judge. (11th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hearst Newspapers Uniquely Criticize</h3>
<p>Washington: The Hearst newspaper chain today strongly criticized the speech delivered by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman to the Senate yesterday. The newspapers uniformly published editorials, denouncing the speech as containing chauvinism and demanding that President Roosevelt and the State Department deny it, saying that the world should know that Senator Pittman is not speaking in the capacity of a government spokesman, but only as a politician overstepping his bounds.

<h3>Eastern Newspapers Comment One After Another, Pointing Out It Will Harm US-Japan Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today, saying that the rude remarks made by US Senator Pittman in his speech against Japan have been criticized by British intellectuals and are not words that should be uttered by high-ranking politicians such as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which we find regrettable. It is very clear that China is an independent and sovereign country, without Pittman's explanation. Criticizing Japan's actions without considering China's national conditions and the history of Sino-Japanese relations can be understood as inappropriate by anyone with knowledge of Far Eastern affairs. Japan has never infringed upon China's sovereignty and has no intention of infringing upon China in the future. This is our only reply to Pittman. Pittman's speech is just rambling talk to his own people, which sensible Americans can understand. We are determined not to believe that the feelings of the Japanese and American people will deteriorate because of this statement. Such inconsiderate remarks are not without the risk of causing unforeseen consequences, so Pittman should bear a heavy responsibility for his remarks. (12th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: An editorial in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun said, "Why is German military man Pittman so frightened of and opposed to Japan? Although the motive and reason are not something we can speculate on, Pittman made a similar anti-Japanese speech in his electoral district of Nevada in early December last year. The United States will hold presidential and congressional elections this autumn, so the atmosphere in American political circles is tense and domestic debate is lively. However, it is especially unfavorable for the country targeted by such violent remarks when contemptuous remarks that disregard foreign relations are made by the Senate. We deeply believe that these violent and absurd remarks are not worthy of a smile from American intellectuals. However, if what Pittman said enters the minds of the American public, it may destroy the friendly relations between Japan and the United States. Therefore, we must refute Pittman's anti-Japanese speech." (12th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chairman of the US House Armed Services Committee Strongly Advocates Expanding Military Preparations Plans to Request $70 Million to Add 800 Aircraft</h3>
<p>Washington: Yesterday's speeches by Senators Pittman and Lewis in the Senate have encouraged those in Congress who are demanding an increase in the army budget to go further and demand exceeding the recommendations of the Appropriations Committee. House Armed Services Committee Chairman McSwain announced today that he is prepared to fight for an appropriation of $70 million to add 800 aircraft. According to the Army Department's budget, it only requests $45 million to build 565 aircraft. McSwain said, "We will fight hard because America's aviation program is five years behind and must be made to suit the current turbulent world." However, Parks, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said that the current proposal is satisfactory and is sufficient to make the defenses of the Pacific as solid as the Strait of Gibraltar because these 560 aircraft and the 16-inch guns in California, Hawaii, and Manaba will have the greatest value. At the same time, the committee will begin studying the naval budget on Thursday, while the Naval Committee is engaged in studying another proposal to increase the naval reserve force, and the Army Committee is studying McSwain's proposal to establish a youth aviation reserve team so that 20,000 young people can receive aviation training. The Navy Department has also approved an appropriation of $15 million to build a naval aviation base in Alameda, California. (11th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Arima Advises Hirota: Unify Japanese Diplomacy Toward China, Resolve to Advance the Three Principles; Provincial Delegates Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Ambassador Arima, who returned to Tokyo on the 12th, immediately went to the Foreign Ministry at 4:30 PM that day to meet with Vice Minister Shigemitsu and Foreign Minister Hirota, discussing for about an hour and a half, reporting in detail on the negotiations with the National Government, and frankly expressing his own opinions. The Ambassador believes that the successful implementation of diplomacy toward China lies in unifying national opinion. In concrete terms, the positions of the military and the Foreign Ministry should be unified to implement a unified policy, and he strongly advocated this point. The Foreign Minister also expressed his agreement, saying that the opinions of the two ministries were completely aligned and that they would advance toward the three principles. Regarding the policy of attending the Nanjing Conference, after careful consultation, in order to promote the success of the conference, they will not adopt the strategy of making demands outright. They will start with the Sino-Japanese cooperation plan, which is most important in applying the three principles, to promote the start of negotiations. A cadre meeting will be held at the Foreign Ministry on the 13th, and Ambassador Arima will be invited to attend again to discuss in detail and consult with the newly appointed Ambassador Arida regarding handover matters. Next week, there will also be an ambassadorial meeting with Matsudaira, Arida, Mushanokōji, and others to exchange views to ensure completeness. (Domei News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota will, within the next day or two, hold a three-ministry conference with the heads of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry, as well as Ambassador Arima, Major General Isoya, and Ambassador Arida, to discuss policies toward China. Ambassador Arima will base his advice on the latest local situation and make the following important suggestions: that at the opportune moment for the reconstruction of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, strict vigilance must be maintained to avoid failure due to extreme haste; that caution must be exercised; and that the most important thing is to unify national opinion and determine a firm and unwavering attitude toward China.</p>
<p>Tokyo: Furthermore, Ambassador Arima will actively work to achieve a unified national opinion toward China in order to put the finishing touches on the work toward China. In the past, there were many in Japan who did not fully understand the issue of China, and there were hasty and hardline arguments on the one hand and intoxicated pro-China arguments on the other, leaving people at a loss as to where to turn. If this is the case, it will inevitably hinder the complete realization of adjusting Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Therefore, the active unification of national opinion by Ambassador Arima, who has been directly in charge of Sino-Japanese diplomacy for many years, is worthy of attention.

<h3>Hirota Meets Okada, Discusses Russia Issue, Advocates Establishing a Demarcation Committee</h3>
<p>Tokyo: When Ambassador Arima met with Foreign Minister Hirota today, he expressed his desire to retire to make way for younger talent. Therefore, after the new Ambassador Arida takes office, Foreign Minister Hirota will adopt a form of accepting Arima's resignation based on his request. (Dentsu News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota met with Prime Minister Okada at 1:20 PM today, reporting on the situation of the Manchurian-Russian border dispute and discussing fundamental solutions, advocating proposing a border demarcation committee, etc., intending to sweep away frequent disputes and establish Japanese-Manchukuo-Russian relations. Foreign Minister Hirota will formally proceed with this. (Dentsu News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to news received here today, the Russian Consul General in Harbin has firmly denied the statement by Manchurian Deputy Foreign Minister Ohashi that the mutiny of Manchurian soldiers on January 30th on the northern border of Suifenhe was instigated by the Russians. Ohashi demanded the immediate extradition of the rebel soldiers who fled into Russian territory and compensation. Ohashi later proposed that a border demarcation committee be established as soon as possible to resolve border disputes. The Russian Consul General agreed to forward his request to Moscow. Furthermore, according to the report received by the Foreign Ministry here from Japanese Ambassador to Changchun, General Minami, the events on the Russian-Manchukuo border are completely different from what Soviet Russia has reported. Therefore, this matter still needs to be investigated on the ground. At the same time, it is heard that the establishment of four more Manchurian offices in Russian territory to match the number of Russian consulates in Manchukuo is unrelated to the border issue.

<h3>Soviet Union Clarifies: Reasons for Japanese Rumors, Disrupting Franco-Soviet Pact, Preparing for Next Election</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet government gazette Izvestia reported, "Recently, the Japanese press has entered a state of madness. They are making shameless noise to the world, warning people that there is a possibility of war breaking out in the Far East every minute, and publishing Japanese military strategic plans in grandiose articles. There are no so-called military secrets anymore. There is a question, that is, since the Japanese authorities know that there are no conflicts on the Manchurian-Mongolian border, why do they deliberately create alarming news? Why does the Nichi Nichi Shimbun insist that there was a fierce battle near Kellemz? Why are the Japanese authorities silent about such lies, or even encouraging rumors? We know that the Japanese authorities want to use this kind of provocative propaganda to cover up their internal affairs, and there are other reasons. Today, the French National Assembly will discuss the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. This pact is intended to consolidate the European collective security system, but some governments in Europe are very unhappy about it. Therefore, the Japanese authorities are encouraging their newspapers to create rumors in order to repay the European governments that are willing to disrupt the Franco-Soviet Pact. Whether this motive is spontaneous or instructed by others, we will not ignore it. They are sensationalizing the world with false and alarming news, trying to shake the members of the French National Assembly and intimidate them with the imminent war in the Far East. This is to repay their European benefactors. Japan will hold elections in ten days. These alarming rumors are intended to influence voters. They fabricate news, saying that others intend to invade and that war is imminent, in order to intimidate voters. In this way, the election will go to the following people, that is, they say that Japan's budget is not a budget for the whole country, but a budget for the military. They imply to voters that they must elect soldiers, who hold important positions and can take care of everything. If readers can trace the origins of Japanese reports, and see their rough, naive, and clumsy points (this is a characteristic of Japanese reporters), they will inevitably draw the above conclusions. Gentlemen, your efforts will be in vain, because we can see through your hearts." (TASS News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow: A dispatch from Kulun states that the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun carried a message from its Harbin correspondent claiming that on February 8th, 600 Mongolian soldiers attacked a Japanese patrol team in the Kellemz area. The two sides opened fire, resulting in heavy losses on both sides. The Kulun government authorities stated that this news is completely inaccurate. No conflict occurred in the Kellemz area or other areas of Mongolia on February 8th. At the same time, no conflict has occurred in the Kellemz area either before or after February 8th. The most recent conflict between Mongolian troops and Japanese-Manchukuo troops was at 5:00 PM on February 9th, near Lake Iren-Dabasu Nor (200 kilometers southwest of Kellemz). A team of Japanese-Manchukuo troops in six trucks and one car invaded Mongolian territory and surrounded the rear of the Mongolian border post. They also attempted to seize a group of horses from the border post (within 10 kilometers of the border inside Mongolia) in preparation for attacking the post. The Mongolian troops retaliated, and they quickly retreated to the border. Therefore, the claim of a conflict on February 8th is completely unfounded. Various documents prove that the Mongolian People's Republic has avoided conflict in the past and present, while Japanese warlords have repeatedly launched border conflicts, invaded Mongolian territory, even reaching more than 25 li (such as in the Khalkhyn Gol area), attacking Mongolian border posts, and destroying border markers. Japanese newspapers want to explain a series of robber attacks as defending Manchukuo from Mongolian attacks, but we must admit that the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun correspondent in Harbin has broken the previous record of Japanese newspapers for creating rumors, because previously they were distorting facts, but now they are fabricating facts. According to well-informed sources in Kulun, the purpose of the Japanese warlords' rumors is to create evidence to justify their new and more serious provocative actions in the Mongolian border area, which they are actively preparing. The report by the Nichi Nichi Shimbun correspondent in Harbin that Japanese-Manchukuo troops are now concentrating on the eastern border of the Mongolian People's Republic proves the aforementioned criminal preparations.

<h3>German Anxiety About Japanese Goods Competition</h3>
<p>Berlin: The Japanese government recently established a specialized agency to study the improvement of the quality of Japanese goods. As a result, the quality of Japanese exports has improved compared to the past. German business people are expressing concern about this, believing that if Japanese goods can maintain their current prices, German exports will be greatly affected. They hope that once the quality has been improved, the selling price will increase accordingly, so that they can compete with them. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Severe Storms and Cold in Britain, 14 Deaths from Freezing</h3>
<p>London: Storms have been raging across Britain for days, and the severe cold has been rampant. As of yesterday, it had not yet subsided. Although the wind has subsided slightly today, the temperature is still very low. There have been 14 deaths from freezing, including five in Northampton alone. In some coastal areas, the seawater has frozen, hindering navigation. Several ships in the Irish Sea are in a dangerous situation. After the Spanish postal ship "Constance" encountered danger, a lifeboat was dispatched to rescue it. It is still unknown whether it can escape danger. The "Duntalk" lightship on the Irish coast almost sank in the waters of Cork Harbour. (Havas Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, Submitted to French National Assembly for Discussion, What Kind of Reaction Will Germany Have? London Authorities are Uneasy</h3>
<p>Paris: The Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, signed here last May by former Prime Minister Laval (then Minister of Foreign Affairs) and Soviet Ambassador Potemkin, has not yet been ratified. It was not submitted to the National Assembly for discussion until 4:00 PM today. Du Raille, a member of the Leftist Independent Party, will present a report as the rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee, supporting the ratification and pointing out that if a war breaks out in the Far East, France will definitely not be dragged into the vortex because of this treaty, so it can be approved with confidence. It is heard that many members of the left and right wings will raise questions to the government, so the discussion will take several days to conclude. (Havas News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>London: At a time when Geneva is buried in studying the oil embargo against Italy, another difficult problem has arisen, making the European authorities uneasy. What is this difficult problem? That is, what kind of impact will Franco-German relations have after the signing of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. London sources believe that Germany will probably not take other actions other than protesting against this treaty, pointing to the spirit of violating the Locarno Treaty. The British court believes that Foreign Minister Neurath's statement to British Foreign Secretary Eden that Germany attaches importance to the Locarno Treaty is very important, because judging from this statement, in any case, there is no need to worry about German troops occupying the non-militarized zone in the next few months. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, the debate in the French National Assembly on the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty has been extended to tomorrow. During yesterday's discussion, former Finance Minister Lastiri proposed a temporary truce for consideration, and a discussion would take place after former Russia had cleared the 25,000,000,000 gold francs of debt owed to France, but Foreign Minister Flandin said that when negotiating this treaty, the rights of French creditors had been clearly reserved. After the Foreign Minister made this statement, Lastiri's motion was withdrawn. The Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty was concluded by Laval and Russian Ambassador to France Potemkin on May 2nd last year. It contains five articles, based on Articles 10, 15, and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, stipulating that the two countries should help each other immediately in the event of unprovoked aggression. (Reuters News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Franco-Russian Pact</h3>
<p>The Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty is divided into two parts, one is the treaty, which has five articles in addition to the preamble, and the other is the protocol, which has three articles. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>The French Republic and the Soviet Union, in order to consolidate peace, guarantee the implementation of the International League of Nations Covenant, and conclude a European agreement, have signed a treaty as follows:</p>
<p>Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty</p>
<p>Article 1: France and the Soviet Union agree that if they are threatened by a European country, they shall immediately consult each other and take steps in accordance with Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>Article 2: In accordance with Article 15, paragraph 7, of the League of Nations Covenant, if France and the Soviet Union are invaded without provocation, the two countries shall immediately provide mutual assistance to each other.</p>
<p>Article 3: Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that a member state that engages in aggression in disregard of the provisions of Articles 13 and 15 of the Covenant shall be deemed to have committed a crime against all member states of the League of Nations. In this case, France and the Soviet Union shall immediately provide mutual assistance to each other. If a non-member state of the League of Nations engages in aggression in accordance with Article 17, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Covenant, and targets France and the Soviet Union as its aggression targets, France and the Soviet Union shall also immediately provide mutual assistance to each other.</p>
<p>Article 4: This treaty does not restrict the steps that the League of Nations should take to ensure peace.</p>
<p>Article 5: This treaty shall be ratified by the governments of the signatory countries as soon as possible after its signature, and registered with the Secretariat of the League of Nations. The validity period of the treaty is set at five years. If one of the signatory countries does not declare its termination one year before the expiration date, the treaty shall remain in effect indefinitely, but the signatory country may subsequently notify its termination one year in advance.</p>
<p>Franco-Soviet Protocol</p>
<p>Article 1: In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of this treaty, if the Executive Council of the League of Nations passes a recommendation for resolving a dispute in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, one of the signatories shall be obligated to prepare to provide immediate assistance to the other party in accordance with the Executive Council's recommendation. For this reason, the signatories agree that in such circumstances, the signatories shall act jointly to ensure that the Executive Council issues a recommendation within the necessary swift period. If the Executive Council does not issue a recommendation, or the recommendation is not unanimously adopted, the signatories' obligation to provide mutual assistance shall still apply. The signatories further agree that the mutual assistance obligations stipulated in this treaty are specifically applicable when the territory of one of the signatories is actually invaded.</p>
<p>Article 2: The signatories agree that if the clauses contained in this treaty conflict with the treaty obligations borne by one of the signatories, and are sufficient to cause one party to be subject to international sanctions, then those clauses shall not apply.</p>
<p>Article 3: The signatories mutually acknowledge that within a reasonable period of time, with the mutual consent of the signatories, they are free to participate in various agreements of a similar nature, and to participate directly or indirectly, depending on the appropriate situation. After participating in this agreement, the obligations arising from the various agreements shall replace the obligations arising from this treaty.</p>
<p>The government of the signatory countries declares that this treaty has arisen from previous repeated negotiations. The previous repeated negotiations sought to establish an early peace agreement that would include all countries in Northeast Europe, such as the Soviet Union, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Baltic countries bordering Soviet territory. In addition, a tripartite mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union, France, and Germany should be concluded, stipulating that if one of the three countries invades another country, the other country should provide assistance to the invaded country. Although this agreement is still expected by the signatory countries, the circumstances have not allowed it to be established so far. For this reason, the signatories agree that the obligations stipulated in the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty may only be applied within the scope of the aforementioned tripartite mutual assistance agreement. Furthermore, France and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty on November 29, 1932. The obligations of this non-aggression can also be promoted to universal application. Therefore, if one of the signatories is invaded and the aggressor is not a country listed in the aforementioned tripartite mutual assistance agreement, the other party shall not provide any assistance to the aggressor in the event of a conflict.

<h3>Romanian-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact</h3>
<p>Disagreement Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: Regarding the negotiations on the Romanian-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, although the newspapers have reported that an agreement has been reached after the meeting between Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu in Paris the other day, according to a telegram from our interviewer, the authorities of Russia and Romania have not yet agreed on the terms of this treaty. (Havas News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>London: Sources in Russia say that the Russian-Romanian Mutual Assistance Treaty will be signed soon, but no definite date has been announced. Regarding this treaty, it is rumored that the contents are roughly the same as the Franco-Russian and Russian-Czech Mutual Assistance Treaties, and it is stipulated that in the event of a war between Hungary and Romania, the Soviet Union will automatically send troops to assist. As for the issue of the passage of Russian troops, if Czechoslovakia is invaded by Germany, the Soviet Union should send troops to assist in accordance with the Russian-Czech Mutual Assistance Treaty. At that time, Romania should allow the Soviet Union's army and air force to pass through, so as to provide assistance to Czechoslovakia. This issue was negotiated at great expense. It was learned that because the Russian-Romanian Treaty was based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, if Czechoslovakia was invaded by Germany, Russia and Romania would both be members of the League of Nations and would have an obligation to assist Czechoslovakia. There is no question that transit is a problem. Therefore, this difficulty was resolved. (Havas News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Activities in Paris</h3>
<p>Berlin Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>Paris: Czech Prime Minister Hodza visited Senate President Janán and National Assembly Speaker Buisson this morning, and attended a luncheon hosted by Foreign Minister Flandin at noon. He is scheduled to visit Prime Minister Sarraut at 11:00 AM tomorrow. (Havas News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Soviet Deputy Defense Commissioner General Tukhachevsky and Czech Prime Minister Hodza are both consulting in Paris at this time. German newspapers are paying close attention to the actions of the two. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported that Hodza and former French Prime Minister and former leader of the Radical Socialist Party Herriot have a close friendship, and that the purpose of this trip to France is to strengthen the economic relations between Austria and other countries in the Danube River basin. France is naturally supportive of this because it can obtain financial benefits. (Havas News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Danube River Countries Agree on Partial Agreements</h3>
<p>Seeking Political and Economic Cooperation, Negotiations are Actively Underway</p>
<p>Regarding the current state of negotiations on the conclusion of partial agreements by the countries in the Danube River basin, according to what our interviewer knows, they will be actively carried out in the next few weeks. The proposed organization seems to be based on two steps politically: 1. The countries concerned will issue a declaration to strengthen friendly relations and declare that disputes should be submitted to arbitration for resolution. 2. The countries concerned will conclude non-aggression treaties, stipulating that they shall not interfere in each other's internal affairs. The ultimate goal is to conclude mutual assistance treaties. In addition, the countries concerned also plan to conclude collective treaties to find ways to cooperate economically. Regarding this level, the countries should first sign a treaty with Austria, and then extend it to the remaining countries. Czech sources here believe that the commercial agreement between the Czech Republic and Austria can be established before the economic conference of the Little Entente countries is held (held every six months). Prime Minister Hodza is currently staying in Paris and is scheduled to go to the capital of Yugoslavia on the 21st of this month, and from there he will go to the capital of Romania before going to Vienna at the end of this month to contact each other.

<h3>Italy's View on European Affairs: Unwilling to Remain Aloof</h3>
<p>Lest It Be Excluded from the Peace Camp; Unwilling to See Post-War Events Replayed Today</p>
<p>A recent article in the semi-official Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" of Rome, authored by the renowned journalist Gaeda, elaborated on Italy's stance, stating its unwillingness to remain aloof from European affairs. It stated, "We do not wish to be rejected by nations whose duty is to safeguard peace. Yet, those nations claiming to safeguard European peace are attempting to exclude our nation from their group. Recalling the Treaty of Versailles, nations divided and seized German colonies as their own, excluding our nation. This attempt to exclude our nation, previously enacted, is now being replayed," and so on. (Havas dispatch, November 11)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Imposes Oil Embargo on Italy</h3>
<p>Likely to Be Ineffective Without U.S. Cooperation; Expert Report Divided into Four Sections; Italian Reserves Estimated to Last Only Four Months</p>
<p>Geneva, today, according to reliable sources, the expert committee has concluded that an oil embargo against Italy cannot be effectively implemented if the United States refuses to participate. However, if the United States limits its oil exports to Italy to normal figures, the oil embargo may succeed. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>
<p>The report that the expert committee on the coal and oil embargo, under the eighteen-nation subcommittee of the League of Nations, is expected to submit, will be finalized in Geneva immediately. According to unofficial sources, the report is divided into four sections: 1) the situation of coal and oil exports to Italy; 2) the sales situation of coal and oil in Italy; 3) the situation of stockpiling; and 4) the situation of production. It is stated that since 1931, Italy's imports of coal and oil have increased annually, reaching 3,800,000 tons in 1935, an average annual increase of 13 percent. In 1935, the national consumption was 3,500,000 tons, with 30,000 tons being consumed in East Africa. Its current oil reserves are estimated to last only four months. The experts believe that if the United States takes some action on the issue of oil exports, no matter what form it takes, it could make the League of Nations' oil embargo effective.

<h3>Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Visits French Aviation Facilities</h3>
<p>Expected to Return Home by the End of the Week</p>
<p>Paris, General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Soviet Deputy Commissar of Defense and Chief of the Army General Staff, arrived here from London a few days ago.

Tukhachevsky is scheduled to depart for home at the end of this week. (Havas dispatch, November 11)</p>
<h3>On the Southern Front: Abyssinian Army Recaptures Key Stronghold</h3>
<p>Gulati is a Particularly Important Water Source; Fierce Battle Leads to Italian Forced Retreat</p>
<p>The province of Worq Amba Gedamu, near Addis Ababa, has been quiet for some time. Today, a fierce battle suddenly broke out in Gulati, 50 miles southeast of Sasa Bane. It is reported that a column of Italian troops advanced from Haradigit towards Sasa Bane. Haradigit and Gulati are two miles apart, and both have many wells with drinking water, so both sides attach great importance to them and fought fiercely for control. Governor of Harar, General Nasibu, has been personally directing the battle with Turkish General Wehib Pasha at Dagha Bur. Today, the Abyssinian side launched an attack. According to Abyssinian sources, the Abyssinian army has won a complete victory. Italian troops had established fortified positions in Guku Gulati, but the area is densely forested, so the Abyssinian army was able to launch a surprise attack. It is reported that both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>
<h3>MacDonald's Son Wins Four-Way Election</h3>
<p>London: Malcolm MacDonald, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, lost his seat in the House of Commons three months ago. Today, a by-election was held in Ross and Cromarty. MacDonald has won a four-way contest and can return to the House of Commons. The results of the vote are as follows: MacDonald (Government Party) received 8,949 votes; McNeil (Labour Party) received 5,964 votes; Churchill (Conservative Party) received 2,427 votes; and Thomas (Liberal Party) received 738 votes. The election campaign was suspended for several days due to the death of the King. Later, due to inclement weather, the candidates found it difficult to travel around. Sometimes cars were stuck in ditches, and sometimes, due to slippery roads or heavy snow, they had to abandon their cars and walk. The area is vast and mountainous, and the candidates spared no effort to travel to every corner, sometimes having to travel by boat. Each candidate used agricultural policy proposals to win the support of the people. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>

<p>— The Application of National History Teaching Materials in Primary and Secondary Schools. Zheng Hesheng, Full-Time Editor and Compiler, National Institute for Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>Listeners, today's topic is "The Application of National History Teaching Materials in Primary and Secondary Schools." With the goal set, the application of teaching materials can have a consistent thread: China is the first ancient civilization in the world, and the origin of historical records is also among the earliest, so our historical materials are richer than those of any other country, and it is naturally difficult for us to study them. In the past, Song Dynasty Chancellor Wen Tianxiang had the saying, "Where to begin with a seventeen-history series?" Now, just in terms of the official histories, there are more than seventeen, let alone other historical books. Mr. Liang Qichao felt that one of the most embarrassing things in his life was that every time he encountered young students asking him what books they should read to study national history, he would "hesitate for a long time" and finally be unable to answer. He believed that there was no other way to answer besides the Twenty-Four Histories, the Zizhi Tongjian, and the Three General Histories. However, in today's world where everything needs to be rebuilt, it is impossible for young men and women to read these vast ancient books, let alone spend so much time and effort on them. How much can be gained? Is it enough to seek the achievements of our ancestors from this alone? Not only is it not enough, but even if we read through the tens of thousands of volumes recorded in the Sui, Tang, and Ming Dynasties... it is still not enough. Since old histories cannot be read completely, and even if they are read completely, they cannot meet our needs, then the only option is not to read them. If this is the case, I am afraid that in less than ten years, Chinese history will be completely driven out of the academic circle. Therefore, he thought of reforming national history, which is the most urgent problem at present. The compilation of history textbooks is to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>In the United States, when children are able to read, they often switch from oral instruction to textbook instruction. Americans believe that the most important aid in teaching history is textbooks. In fact, textbooks are not only an aid, but in most American schools, textbooks determine the facts to be taught and the methods of teaching. A teacher who teaches any grade above the third grade of elementary school is almost always required to have a textbook for student use until the end of the secondary school history course. The adoption of textbooks is generally the same in all countries around the world, and our schools are no exception.</p>
<p>Since textbooks are necessary for primary and secondary school students, the mission of compiling textbooks is very important. The application of teaching materials is a prerequisite, especially with regard to historical teaching materials. American historian James Harvey Robinson once said: "In the field of history, we do not have a clear outline like mathematics. Although ordinary historians believe that they have included all the most important facts when compiling history textbooks, just like chemists or geologists compiling their natural science textbooks, history is very special because it studies things that are extremely complex, unlike chemistry, which has certain phenomena." He also said: "Since the past facts are so abundant, what guarantee do we have that ordinary historians have summarized the most important and relevant events in human experience for teaching children?" This is the reason. Regarding this, it is a matter of how to apply teaching materials. Now, I will present two points based on what I have seen to explain as follows:</p>
<p>The Central Problem of Applying Teaching Materials: The occurrence of human events is extremely complex. We should think of a way to "control the complex with the simple," which is what we call the central problem here. Among these complex phenomena, which are sufficient to be historical materials? First, we should understand the definition of history. The definition of history is nothing more than recording the continuous activities of human society, comparing their overall achievements, and seeking their causal relationships as a reference for the activities of modern people. It actually contains the meaning of teaching. American historian Johnson Henry said: "History, I am afraid, has been a part of teaching since mankind became aware of history," which is what he means. However, the objects of event research are also different. The study of history by scholars and the teaching of history by educators have obvious differences in their central ideas. Generally, the purpose of scholars is to collect remote materials and explore advanced theories in order to promote the progress of specialized academic fields; educators, on the other hand, extract the important items of each part and elaborate on their essence, hoping to achieve applicable effects on national morality and knowledge. The former belongs to the responsibility of university specialized schools for advanced research; the latter belongs to the responsibility of ordinary education in primary and secondary schools. But how can we extract the major facts and elaborate on their essence as a reference for the general public? This relies on having a central idea as a standard for tailoring.</p>
<p>This central standard often changes with the needs of the times and the environment. Since the eighteenth century, Prussia wanted to establish a unified nation, so the nationalist historiography, the so-called Prussian School, swept the country. In France, before the revolution, the teaching of history and geography, the teaching of national language and literature, and even afterwards, the historical aspect particularly emphasized the revolution itself, because its value in education is often based on the interests of the nation. James Harvey Robinson once said: "Our interests are constantly changing, so the questions we hope the past will answer must also change constantly. We have recently had many history textbooks that dare to delete many facts that have been used improperly and want to connect their records with current needs. But we believe that this method of renewal can be further advanced; our best textbooks still include many facts that are not worthy of children's attention and neglect many facts that are most worthy of narration." This paragraph of discussion is very worthy of our reference.</p>
<p>What are the current situation and environment of our society, country, and nation? What should be the central idea of our application of national history? This is a very noteworthy event. Our country is now in a situation and environment where internal and external troubles are intertwined, but how can we achieve the goal of "pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression?" Then we must seek it in the lessons of history. Pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression is a whole event, because by pacifying the interior, we can resist foreign aggression. There are many historical events in our country regarding internal and external troubles. The effects, gains, and losses can be counted one by one. For example, Duke Yi of Wei liked cranes and indulged in pleasure and extravagance, which led to the reduction by the Di, the destruction of the country, and the death of himself. Duke Wen of Wei wore clothes made of coarse cloth and caps made of coarse silk, devoted himself to financial management and agricultural training, promoted commerce and benefited workers, respected education and encouraged learning, and assigned positions to competent people. In the first year, he had 30 chariots, and in the final year, he had 300 chariots, and eventually restored the country. Duke Xiao of Qin wanted to repair Duke Mu's hegemony and recover the lost land that had been invaded. He ordered the search for talents. Shang Yang heard about it and entered Qin, rectified the internal affairs, and Qin flourished. Another example is that the literati and officials of the Western Jin Dynasty regarded Qingtan as high, which led to the fall of the country, while Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin Dynasty employed talented people. At that time, the figures in political and military affairs had removed the habit of Qingtan and turned to active action. Zu Ti repeatedly planned to attack the north and vowed to restore the Central Plains. He once struck the boat and crossed the river, claiming: "If Ti cannot clear the Central Plains and return, this river is like this!" Tao Kan was stationed in Jingxiang and quelled internal rebellion. When he was in Guangzhou, he transported hundreds of bricks every morning and evening, and cherished time. He once took wine vessels and gambling equipment and threw them into the river, saying that gambling was a pig-herding game and not suitable for literati and officials. Wang Dao and famous scholars had banquets in Xinting, Nanjing, saying, "We should work together to revitalize the royal family and restore Shenzhou. Why do we have to act like Chu prisoners facing each other and weeping?" We who read history know that people with lofty ideals, when in times of hardship, all take the responsibility of revival on themselves with a firm and determined spirit. The reason why the Eastern Jin Dynasty was able to partially settle in Jiangzuo was largely dependent on this spirit.</p>
<p>Regarding the traces of the rise and fall of our society, country, and nation, only a few examples are listed, which are enough to serve as lessons for the current nation-building and salvation. Other events are too numerous to mention. When we teach national history, we should take the question of "how to pacify the interior and resist foreign aggression" as its central teaching material. Regarding the history of societies, countries, and nations of past dynasties, such as founding a country (such as the Yellow Emperor and Mr. Sun Yat-sen, etc.), the middle and the restoration of the country (such as King Goujian of Yue and Duke Wen of Wei, etc.), opening up the borders (such as Emperor Wu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang, etc.), promoting national prestige (such as Ban Chao and Zheng He, etc.), quelling internal rebellions (such as Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi, etc.), resisting foreign aggression (such as Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou, etc.), refusing to yield as envoys (such as Su Wu and Zhang Qian, etc.), supporting the difficult and dangerous (such as Wang Dao and Xie An, etc.), sacrificing oneself for righteousness (such as Yue Fei and Wen Tianxiang, etc.), being eager for public good and being righteous (such as Xian Gao and Bu Shi, etc.), as well as spreading nationalism (such as Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongyi, etc.), inventing science and manufacturing (such as Zhang Heng and Cai Lun, etc.), the character, deeds, and relationship and influence of these former sages and martyrs to the entire society, country, and nation, as well as the changes in academic thoughts, the changes in social systems, the rise and fall of moral customs, the prosperity and decline of the national economy...etc., should all be explained in detail and elaborated as much as possible. Other historical facts that are not related to these may be reduced as much as possible, so that students can understand the responsibility of nation-building and salvation, and the contribution to world culture.</p>
<p>The Problem of the Distribution of Teaching Materials for Each Grade: The value of history teaching is nothing more than moral training, civic training, memory, judgment, and imagination training. This kind of training has a great relationship with the age and knowledge of the students. According to our country's current school system, primary and junior high school students are generally young and simple in knowledge. Whether in terms of physical or psychological development, they are not fully developed. More abstract or advanced principles are often not easy to understand. High school students already have a basic concept of history, and their physical or psychological development has reached a sufficient level. The selection of teaching materials may be slightly more advanced and complex. The distribution of history teaching materials must be suitable for the degree of physical and psychological development of the students. Therefore, the distribution of teaching materials for each grade is also a very important issue. Johnson Galley believed that: "Preliminary history, the facts expressed by abstract methods, are advanced history. For the students in the first grades of elementary school, the content of history should be based on examples. This kind of history should be based on description and narration, not necessarily dissection. When using reasoning, it should also be based on being able to immediately become an example. This does not mean that history in elementary schools must be completely written in descriptive articles, nor does it mean that students in elementary schools should not have the opportunity to reason and analyze. It just means that the materials for reasoning and application should be based on examples. History compiled in this way, and history taught in this way, can of course slowly introduce general facts into the higher grades after five or six years. For students aged ten or eleven, special facts should still be the main focus; for students aged seventeen or eighteen, special facts should continue, but our discussion should be able to go to general history." This paragraph of discussion is the most clear in distinguishing the level of history for teaching primary and secondary school students, and it is very worthy of the attention of history teachers.

<h3>The Plight of Liu Guitang's Bandit Gang After Their Defeat in Shandong Province: Liu's Movements Are Extremely Secret and Unclear; 30 Bandits Captured at Sangyuan Station Executed;剿 Bandit Troops Have Returned to Their Defense Posts One After Another</h3>
<p>Dezhou Correspondent: Liu Guitang, the fierce bandit who has been causing trouble in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, this time used a feint attack to suddenly enter the Shandong province from Wang Qingyi Village, Jing County, Hebei Province, on the ninth of this month to the Third Shop area north of Dezhou City. At the same time, another group of about 200 people infiltrated Qiuxian County on the northwestern border of Shandong Province. The situation was quite tense. The 21st passenger train going south from Jinan on the Jinpu Railway stopped at Lianzhen Station on the morning of the ninth, which was seemingly a serious situation to cut off the Jinpu Railway traffic. Fortunately, it was quickly quelled. Now, the details of Liu's bandit infiltration into Shandong are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Guitang's bandit troops, since the Handan and Cixian areas, were jointly suppressed by the 32nd Army and the 29th Army of the two provinces of Hebei and Henan, along with the local armed forces of the people, regardless of day or night. As a result, they had been disintegrated into smaller units, scattered and defeated, no longer forming a large gang. Liu was exceptionally cunning and planned by someone behind the scenes. In order to avoid the concentration of government troops for suppression, heavy sacrifices, and to confuse the government troops, they first split into smaller groups and then slowly planned to infiltrate the coastal counties of northeast Shandong Province, such as Lijin, Zhanhua, and Putai. On the sixth, they were still in Yijing, with very few people. They did not expect their infiltration into Shandong to be so fast. On the morning of the ninth, a report was suddenly received here, stating that about 100 bandits of Liu (some say 40 or 50 people) infiltrated the Third Shop area in the northern border of Dezhou City from Jing County in northern Hebei. The 21st and 75th trains going south on Jinpu Railway stopped at Lianzhen Station. Chen Dexin, the commander of the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division of the garrison, received the news and immediately dispatched Regiment Commander Zhang Xuzeng to lead his troops to meet the enemy. At the same time, he reported to the Joint City Division Headquarters and the Jinan Headquarters. County Magistrate Li Shude also personally led the Joint Village Association and the police to assist in the suppression. At that time, Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division, was departing from Liaocheng and arrived in Linqing. He ordered a certain regiment of Chen's brigade to intercept and suppress the bandits in the Sangyuan area and protect the Jinpu Railway traffic. After all parties were properly arranged, Zhang's regiment and Li Shude, and others had rushed to the Third Shop to come into contact with the bandits. The bandits resisted slightly and fled northeast, crossing the Jinpu Railway and fleeing back to the Erzhuang area west of Wuqiao County in northern Hebei. In the middle, they were ambushed by the Sangyuan ambush troops, suffering even greater losses. Only more than 20 people fled in panic. In this battle, in addition to those killed on the spot, Zhang's regiment captured several people alive, and the Joint Village Association captured three people alive. They seized seven mules and many long and short guns. In addition to escorting the captured bandits to the headquarters of the 86th Brigade, the guns and mules were awarded to members of the Joint Village Association who contributed to the suppression of bandits to encourage them. At the same time, many of Liu's bandits, because they did not have time to escape, hid their guns, changed into civilian clothes, and attempted to escape by train from Sangyuan Station. Unexpectedly, when they arrived near the station, they were interrogated by the garrison troops, and the truth was revealed. Thirty people were captured. At noon on the tenth, after interrogation, they were all executed on the spot to intimidate the bandits. All the remaining bandits were driven out of the province. This is the situation of Liu's bandit infiltration into Shandong. According to the captured Liu bandits, Liu Guitang himself had personally led this group into Shandong and had changed into civilian clothes and fled out of the province. However, some people said that Liu himself is leading a large group in the Jiahe County area of northern Hebei. It is rumored that Liu's whereabouts are extremely secretive. Even his subordinates, if they are not confidants, it is difficult to know the details. This statement may be inaccurate. Liu's method of recruiting bandits is also very simple and comprehensive. First, he secretly sends people to the counties planned for infiltration to lie in ambush. Once a small group arrives, they will join forces, so the number of people gathers more and more. This time, the three provinces suppressed bandits, breaking the old habit of using neighbors as ditches, without distinction between regions, and suppressed bandits across borders, so the effect was great. This time, when Liu's bandits entered Shandong, a battalion of the 32nd Army followed and pursued them to Dezhou, and only returned to the original defense in Xingtai on the tenth. It is learned that the headquarters of the 29th Division of Shandong will return to the original defense in Jinan from Liaocheng on the eleventh, and its 87th Brigade will also return to its original station.</p>
<p>Remnants of Liu's Bandits Arrested in Western Suburbs of Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondent: After the bandit troops of Liu Guitang were jointly suppressed by the local garrison troops, most of them were scattered. On the morning of the ninth, about a hundred remnants of Liu's troops, from an unknown origin, sneaked into Yangcun near Miaofeng Mountain in the western suburbs of Beiping, intending to meet with the bandit leader Lin Yushi, who was hiding there, for secret negotiations. The matter was learned by the two district offices in the northern part of the western suburbs, and all the detectives were dispatched to encircle the remnants and bandits. They were quickly captured completely and escorted into the city under strict military and police escort on the morning of the tenth, and handed over to the Public Security Bureau for detention. After interrogation, they will be transferred to the Military Law Office of the Suiyuan Pacification Office of Hebei and Chahar for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the 32nd Army received a telegram from Huang Guanghua, the commander of the division, reporting from Shunde defense, stating that the division pursued and suppressed the bandits of Liu Guitang, passed through Fucheng from Shunde, and arrived at Sangyuan yesterday. According to the captured bandits, Liu Guitang had escaped from Sangyuan in disguise, and his destination seemed to be Tianjin, where he would hide in the concession. When Liu fled, he was wearing a black cloak and a beaver fur hat, looking very embarrassed. Yang Zhaomin's unit of the cavalry battalion of the 32nd Army stationed in Shenxian County has been dispatched to defend and prevent Liu from fleeing back. (Eleventh)</p>
<h3>Qingdao: Inauguration Ceremony Held; Representatives from All Sides Sent to Participate; Open for Public Viewing for Three Days</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The city's Third Pier has been completed. The inauguration ceremony was held on the 10th of this month. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Central Government, as well as the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways, and the Shandong Provincial Government, all sent representatives to Qingdao from afar to participate. It was truly an unprecedented grand occasion. The details of the event are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: The pier is located between the Second and Fourth Piers. The venue was on the pier itself. A pine archway was erected between the Second and Third Piers, inlaid with large golden characters reading "Qingdao City Third Pier Inauguration Ceremony", fully adorned with red and green flowers and five-colored electric lights. To the north of the archway was a spacious large mat shed, which served as the auditorium for the opening ceremony. The interior was elegantly and beautifully decorated. The roof of the shed was covered with red and blue checkered patterns. The seating arrangement could accommodate over a thousand people. Silver congratulatory banners were lined up on the stage, leaving almost no space. The portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung in the center. Directly west of the auditorium was the newly built Third Pier, with three pine archways arranged on it, with five-colored electric lights clustered like stars. The utility poles on both sides were also surrounded by pine branches, full of green, looking like spring. Combined with the distant mountains, lingering clouds, and blue waves, it was a picturesque scene. Ships were docked around the pier, including four naval vessels belonging to the Third Fleet, namely the "Chu Yu," "Tong An," "Jiang Li," and "Yong Xiang," as well as six merchant ships, including "Mao Cheng." All ships were adorned with national flags, celebrating the occasion. The Jiaoji Railway also ran two locomotives for a trial run to add to the spectacle and decoration. The total length of the quay wall is 1,140 meters, which can simultaneously accommodate eight 5,000-ton ships.</p>
<p>Grand Opening: At 8:30 a.m. that morning, representatives from all sectors arrived one after another. Those present included Xiong Bin, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Zhang Honglie, representing the Executive Yuan and Shandong Provincial Government; Lu Mengxiong, representing the Ministry of Railways; Jiang Zuozhou, commander of the 20th Division of the Army; Xie Gangzhe, commander of the Second Fleet; Ge Futing, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Commission; consuls of various countries stationed in Qingdao, and representatives of various organizations and groups in the city, totaling more than 700 people. At 9:00 a.m., the meeting commenced as scheduled. First, Mayor Shen (Honglie), as chairman, took the stage to report, stating that today's inauguration ceremony for the Third Pier was honored by the presence of representatives from all parties, for which he was extremely grateful. The city, in response to environmental needs and under the guidance of the Central Government, built the Third Pier, which took three years to complete. It is truly a glorious achievement since its recapture. However, there are still many areas where equipment is lacking. He hoped that everyone would not hesitate to offer advice and jointly promote development. He originally intended to take this opportunity to seek advice from everyone, but due to the severe cold weather, he dared not trouble them, and so on. After the report, the band led everyone to the western end of the pier for the unveiling ceremony. A monument was built south of the platform, covered with the national flag and tied with five-colored ribbons. After Mayor Shen cut the ribbon, the national flag was raised, and the grand ceremony was completed. At the same time, the Third Fleet dispatched three aircraft to fly over the sky, scattering leaflets and setting off firecrackers. The sound of the planes roared, creating a grand spectacle. After the unveiling, everyone took photographs at the site as a memento. They then returned to the auditorium for refreshments. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. or so. In order to allow all sectors of the city to understand the construction status of the new pier and its importance, it was specially opened for three days after the inauguration ceremony, inviting Chinese and foreign visitors to freely visit. It began loading and unloading cargo from ships starting on the 13th.</p>
<p>Monument Inscription: Jiao'ao is backed by mountains and faces the sea, guarding the eastern throat of Qi. The advantage of shipping allows it to reach the north and south, reaching any place without limitation. The Jiaoji Railway serves as the hub for combined water and land transportation, connecting with the major trunk lines throughout the country, with endless transit. In addition, the port is wide and the water is deep, the climate is mild, and it does not freeze in severe winter, truly a natural harbor. In the past, German merchants leased and developed the commercial port. Since our country took over, more than a decade has passed. Merchants gathered and freight increased. Ships coming and going were busy loading and unloading. The original piers of the large port have always suffered from insufficient allocation. Honglie, who previously commanded the naval fleet, was stationed at Cishi for a long time. He quietly observed the situation and believed that without building more piers, there would be no way to revitalize the port. In the winter of the 20th year, he also took charge of municipal administration and followed the practice of the previous mayor, Hu Ruoyu, by increasing pier fees and continuing to collect them to allocate funds for construction. He also instructed the port authority to make practical plans to build a pier to the north of the Second Pier. In May of the 21st year, tenders were solicited, and Fuchang Company won the bid for 3.9 million yuan. Construction began in July of that year and was fully completed in October of the 24th year, after three years. The project was difficult and required vast expenses. Looking at historical records, such as Li Bing of the Qin Dynasty who dug the Dujiangyan, Zhao Xinmin of the Han Dynasty who built the water gate, and Bai Juyi and Su Shi of the Tang and Song Dynasties who built lake embankments, all of them were for the benefit of the people, with long-term planning, enduring hardship and danger to achieve success. Honglie held office in this state, with exhausted talent and strength. He could not compare to the worthies like Li, Zhao, Bai, and Su. However, he dared not fail in his initial intention to benefit the people. Moreover, prosperity and decline are impermanent throughout history, depending on whether human effort is diligent or not, as the basis for growth and decline. Jiao'ao was merely a desolate fishing village thirty years ago. Through gradual management over the years, it has become a major metropolis in eastern China. The newly built pier today represents progress compared to the initial port. However, given the superior situation of this port, with its capacity to take in and contain, if it can be expanded daily, how difficult would it be to make its scale ten or a hundred times greater than it is today? I secretly wish to work with my colleagues, thinking day and night, to further develop it, hoping to respond to the environment, improve day by day, and bring a hundred years of happiness and benefit to this state. Now that the project is completed, I will describe the outline of the creation and the aspirations I have long cherished, to record it. Written and inscribed by Shen Honglie, Mayor of Qingdao City.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Decides to Issue Short-Term Treasury Bills to Cover the Province's Deficit of Over 970,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province's finances have been relatively abundant over the years, with revenues and expenditures balanced and no debts incurred. However, since last year's devastating floods in western Shandong, revenues have sharply decreased. According to financial calculations, as of the end of January, the province's treasury had a deficit of 550,000 yuan. Combined with the 600,000 yuan borrowed from the treasury bill fund, the total was 1.15 million yuan. From February to June, the estimated actual deficit is over 475,000 yuan, bringing the total deficit to over 1.625 million yuan. At a time when the people's resources are exhausted, there is no way to increase revenue or reduce expenditure. Therefore, a plan was formulated to make up for the deficit. In addition to sending personnel to collect overdue land tax from various counties, which is expected to recover over 300,000 yuan, and suspending the temporary appropriations to various agencies amounting to over 115,000 yuan, the remaining estimated deficit is approximately 974,000 yuan. It is proposed to issue interest-bearing provincial treasury bills in installments, in accordance with accounting regulations, to cover the deficit. The fund will be included in the budget as soon as the next fiscal year begins to ensure its availability. The proposal was submitted for discussion at the provincial government's political affairs meeting on the 11th, and it was decided to approve it. The proposal is recorded as follows: "The Finance Department reported that since the province has been frequently affected by floods and droughts in recent years, the province's treasury has experienced deficits. In addition, last year's Yellow River flood in western Shandong had a particularly severe impact. In addition to the 637,500 yuan for party expenses in counties and cities, 100,684 yuan for land tax and deed tax bonuses, and 400,000 yuan for the provincial reserve fund, which were already approved to offset the income deficit in disaster areas, the estimated deficit as of the end of this year is over 886,000 yuan. Together with the 600,000 yuan borrowed from the treasury bill fund before December, the total deficit is over 1.486 million yuan. Furthermore, the estimated deficit from February to June is over 894,000 yuan, for a total deficit of over 2.38 million yuan. A public decision has been requested in this case. Now, upon investigation, as of the end of January, the province's treasury has an actual deficit of 550,000 yuan. Together with the 600,000 yuan borrowed from the treasury bill fund, the total deficit is 1.15 million yuan. As for the estimated deficit of over 894,000 yuan from February to June, after deducting the 15,000 yuan reduced from the provincial party headquarters' expenses, the 55,000 yuan reduced from Shandong University's expenses, and the over 349,000 yuan from the temporary expenses of various agencies, which should be used to offset judicial revenue, the remaining actual deficit is over 475,000 yuan. Together with the deficit of 1.15 million yuan at the end of January, the total deficit is over 1.625 million yuan. In the aftermath of disasters, the people's resources in various counties are extremely exhausted. On the revenue side, it is impossible to increase various taxes, and on the expenditure side, there is no room for further reduction. After careful consideration, the following three methods are proposed to make up for the deficit where there is no other way: 1. It is found that there are still many outstanding land tax payments from the people in the 24th year in various counties. As of the end of last December, the total outstanding amount is over 400,000 yuan. Personnel have been sent to collect them separately, and it is estimated that over 300,000 yuan can still be recovered. 2. It is found that the two items of provincial reserve fund and temporary expenses of various agencies that should be paid this year, excluding the amounts that have already been approved for disbursement, the remaining amounts that have not been approved for disbursement are estimated to be over 236,000 yuan for the provincial reserve fund and over 315,000 yuan for the temporary expenses of various agencies. At a time of financial difficulty, it is imperative to vigorously reduce expenses to provide support. It is proposed to retain 100,000 yuan for the provincial reserve fund and 100,000 yuan for the temporary expenses of various agencies to prepare for necessary temporary expenses. The remaining over 136,000 yuan for the provincial reserve fund and over 215,000 yuan for the temporary expenses of various agencies will be temporarily suspended. The total amount that can be reduced from the above two items is estimated to be over 351,000 yuan. 3. It is found that Article 3 of the province's accounting regulations stipulates that the provincial government has the authority to issue short-term provincial treasury bills when necessary. It is now found that the aforementioned deficit, after offsetting over 300,000 yuan from overdue land tax and over 351,000 yuan from the suspended provincial reserve fund and temporary expenses of various agencies, the remaining estimated deficit is over 974,000 yuan. It is proposed to issue short-term interest-bearing provincial treasury bills in installments, in accordance with accounting regulations, to cover the deficit. The fund will be included in the budget as soon as the second half of the year begins to ensure its availability. It should be submitted to the meeting for deliberation. Should it be approved or not, please make a public decision." (11th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces Hold Suppression Conference; Luo Zhuoying and Others Arrive in Tunxi to Participate in Formulating Measures to Eliminate Border Bandits</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Although the bandits in southern Anhui have long been annihilated by the National Army and local militias, there are still a few scattered bandits in remote border areas, causing harm. Liu Zhenhua, chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, after inspecting southern Anhui and returning to the province, deeply believed that if the remaining bandits in the border areas were not strictly suppressed, it would have a significant impact on the tea market in southern Anhui. In order to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits and stabilize rural areas, he specially invited Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang to send personnel to Anhui to hold a three-province border area suppression conference to discuss joint suppression measures. Representatives from all provinces arrived in Tunxi in advance and stayed at various hotels in Huangshan and Tunxi. At 9:00 a.m. on the 9th, the three-province border area suppression conference was formally held at the Huangshan Hotel. The attendees included Luo Zhuoying, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression in the border areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui; Shao Youchang, Chief of Staff of the Suppression Headquarters in the border areas of the four provinces; Zhuang Mingyuan, Chief of the Secretariat; Jiang Zhishui, Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Security Department; Lu Zhongxiu, Commissioner of the Quzhou County District of Zhejiang; Liao Shiqiao, Director of the Jiangxi Security Department; Jing Fufu, Commissioner of the Fifth District of Jiangxi; Hui Ji, Director of the Anhui Security Department; and Shi Guozhu, Commissioner of the Tenth District of Anhui, totaling more than 30 people. Representatives from each province reported on the bandit situation on the spot, and then began discussions. The meeting took a break for lunch at 12:00 noon and exchanged opinions. The meeting continued at 2:00 p.m. and lasted for three hours, adjourning at 5:00 p.m. It is reported that the result of this meeting was a comprehensive and meticulous plan for the suppression of scattered bandits in the border areas. Soon, the Suppression Headquarters of the four provinces and the authorities of Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi will strictly order their subordinates to implement it accordingly. Furthermore, when Hui Ji, Director of the Anhui Security Department, passed through Wuhu on the 8th on his way to Tunxi to attend the meeting, he mentioned that Chairman Liu believed that although the banditry in southern Anhui had gradually been pacified, there were still remaining scattered bandits in the border areas between the province and other provinces, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The tea market in Huizhou counties will soon be in full swing. If the scattered elements in the border area are not eliminated, it will have a significant impact on rural production in the future. Therefore, Chairman Liu decided to invite Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces to send personnel to Tunxi for consultation, so that each other's situation can be exchanged at the meeting, and a comprehensive suppression plan can be formulated. In addition to attending the Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi three-province border area suppression conference in Tunxi, I must also go to the Second and Ninth Administrative Inspector Districts to inspect the security militias and the training of the county civilian corps, and so on. In addition, regarding the bandit situation in the border areas of Xuanjing and other counties, according to reliable sources, a few days ago, more than a hundred remaining bandits plotted to attack Xikou and Baibaishu in Xuan County. Our troops launched a fierce attack, and after an hour of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated. In this battle, the bandits killed on the spot included Wu Shuang, the self-proclaimed company commander, Chen Jinshui, the self-proclaimed county commissioner of Jing County, and more than 30 bandits. Our troops also recovered many elegiac couplets and fake military songs of the bandits in the deep caves in Wulao and other remote places, rescued more than 200 refugees, and burned more than 100 thatched huts. The bandits' power has been greatly diminished, and the time for suppression should be imminent. (11th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Develops Huoqiu West Lake; Construction Department Has Sent Personnel to Survey; After Reclamation, 2 Million Yuan Worth of Production Can Be Expected in Two Years</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Huoqiu West Lake is located near the suburbs of the county seat, a famous scenic spot in northern Anhui. The area of the lake is approximately 7,000 hectares, equivalent to approximately 430 square kilometers. Among them, there are 4,000 hectares of cultivated land (including 2,000 hectares of government land). The newly drained land and land in the water each account for approximately 1,000 hectares, all of which are government land. In order to develop the lake and turn all the land into arable land, the Anhui Provincial Government had previously ordered the Huoqiu County Government to complete the construction of a water gate at Renjiagou and a gate at Xinhekou. Subsequently, the provincial government sent Zhang Guangcai, an engineer from the Construction Department, to conduct a detailed survey of the area. It is now learned that Engineer Zhang has submitted a report, proposing to build culverts at Longwokou and Guanzhoukou, reinforce the embankment on the south bank of the Huaihe River in Hubei, and dredge the Lihe River, Wangjieli River, and Xinhe River separately, and raise the river embankments. Except for the culverts and gates, which are to be built by the county government with funds for enemy resistance, the Huaihe embankment will be reinforced by utilizing civilian labor and providing dredging funds. The total earthwork is estimated to be approximately 1.2 million cubic meters, requiring a total of 80,000 yuan for labor and project management fees. The purpose is to eliminate the existing accumulated water so that all the land can be drained and to prevent the accumulation of water during the rainy season. 250 hectares will be set aside in the southeastern part of the lake as a reservoir area. According to Engineer Zhang's estimate, after the initial consolidation project is completed, the original cultivated government land can be cleared, yielding approximately 1,500 hectares. At a price of 200 yuan per hectare, approximately 300,000 yuan can be collected in one go. In addition, approximately 2,000 hectares of newly drained land, if used to establish a farm and lease the land for cultivation, can increase production capacity by 2 million yuan per year, with an annual output of 1,000 yuan per hectare. After receiving the report, the provincial government, because the lake does have the value of operation, decided to operate it. Chairman Liu also paid close attention to this matter and instructed the four department heads to discuss the implementation plan. Regarding the engineering aspects, it was decided that the Construction Department would handle it. Currently, in order to further refine the plan, the Construction Department has appointed Qian Qiming as the leader of the river dredging engineering survey team, organized a survey team to conduct surveys and designs, and supervise the implementation of the project.</p>
<p>Taicang: Highway Project Progressively Completed</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Xihu Highway in this county, transportation has become convenient and the market has gradually prospered. The Kunshan-Taicang section of the Kuntai Road is also completed and will open on March 1. The Construction Department has sent personnel to complete the survey of the route for the Taicang-Liuhe section, and obstacles along the route have also been removed. Since yesterday, a large number of road construction workers have come to Taicang to start construction. It is said that the earth road will be completed and open to traffic by the end of March.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Case of Harboring Bandits in Wusong River Solved</p>
<p>Mao Weishou, a senator of the Military Council, moved his family from Shanghai to Jiangsu. On December 28 of last year, they were suddenly robbed by bandits at the mouth of the Wusong River in the county. After the incident, the County Public Security Bureau strictly pursued the fleeing bandits. The main culprits in the case, Chen Jiaxing, He Ertuzi, He's wife Xue, and Wang Dalunzi, have been successively arrested in Shanghai and sent to Kunshan for interrogation. It is now learned that the bandits confessed that the home of Liu Xuelei, a Yancheng native who farmed rented land on the Wusong River, was their hiding place. They specialized in robbing ships in the area. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent detectives to the Wusong River to arrest the harborer Liu Xuelei and recover more than 20 pieces of stolen clothing, all of which were taken back to the bureau and sent to the judiciary for interrogation.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Corpse Discovered in Wheat Field</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, a corpse that had been beaten to death was discovered in the wheat field of the Diwang Temple in Xiayutoutou outside Loumen. The deceased was approximately thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth short jacket, black cloth trousers, and sneakers. His head had burst open, which appeared to be the fatal wound. The nearby construction workers sent a resident, Wu Fulin, to report to the first sub-bureau of the third public security precinct, which then reported to the local court. The prosecutor arrived for an autopsy at 3:00 p.m. Because the deceased was unfamiliar to the area, his name has not yet been ascertained. The court and the Public Security Bureau are currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Maoshan Line of Liwu Road Open to Traffic</p>
<p>Since the Liwu Road was placed under the management of the Zhencheng Road Office, a branch road has been added to facilitate pilgrims to Maoshan, and special vehicles have been put into service. Workers were ordered to expedite the construction, which has recently been completed. It officially opened to traffic on the 12th. The driving schedule is temporarily set at three round trips. Changes will be made based on future needs. Pilgrims can hire a small chartered car if there are more than ten people. The round-trip fare is calculated at 80% of the normal fare. The vehicles wait at the foot of the mountain for two hours. The departure times from Changzhou to Maoshan are 7:10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., and 1:30 p.m. The departure times from Maoshan to Changzhou are 8:05 a.m., 1:05 p.m., and 2:50 p.m. The entire journey is 66 kilometers.</p>
<p>Changshu: Robbery and Murder of an Old Man in Mochen</p>
<p>In Mochen Town, approximately seven or eight li from the city, a bloody robbery occurred suddenly on the night of the 11th, and an elderly man in his sixties was killed. Mochen Town is an important route for Suzhou-Changzhou buses, and the town has a bus station and a thriving market. A wealthy family named Chen Jinquan lived there. He lived with his brother, Bei Yong, without having divided their assets. He usually lived a secluded life and had long been coveted by bandits. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 11th of this month, more than 20 bandits broke into the Chen residence. Bandits guarded both outside the door and at both ends of the market. At that time, there was a lot of noise. Chen Zengfu, a neighbor of the Chen family, who was already 61 years old, heard the noise and opened the door to see. The bandits mistakenly thought that the old man was going to call for help and resist, so they grabbed him and hacked him with an axe, killing him on the spot. He was hacked seven or eight times in the head and waist. The scene was extremely tragic. The bandits took the loot and fled. The victim has reported the incident to the county for investigation. It is expected that the bandits came from out of town by bus and it will be difficult to apprehend them for a while.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Villages in Shazhou Submit Petitions for Embankment Protection</p>
<p>The villages in Shazhou, Cheng County, are located along the Yangtze River. Since the land in the heart of the river emerged above the water surface in 1922, it has been collapsing, especially after the great flood in 1932. More than 10,000 mu of farmland have been lost. Wujieqiao Mengjiangtang and Lanmensha are all in danger of being submerged. In 1931, the Construction Department established the Jiangchangtong Three-County Embankment Protection Office, which was abolished last winter. Now, the collapse of the villages is becoming more severe. On the 11th, the chiefs of various villages in Zhongzheng, including Yang Qingyun, and Jiang Ben Village, which has a lot of educational and charitable assets, separately submitted petitions to the county government party headquarters, requesting assistance in embankment protection.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Town-Yang Accident Car Unsealed</p>
<p>On the evening of the 11th of last month, Town-Yang Motor Vehicle No. 15 was traveling from Zhenjiang to the Hongqiao Station in Yangzhou, and due to the overcrowding, a passenger, Yu Jingduo (also known as Yu Xiangsheng), was accidentally crushed to death. The court prosecutor's office detained the driver, Chu Shijie, and sealed the vehicle involved in the accident at the Hongqiao Station pending inspection and investigation. Subsequently, the prosecutor considered that Chu Shijie was suspected of negligent homicide and filed a lawsuit in court. On the morning of the 10th, Judge Yu held a public hearing. The defendant's lawyers, Dai Tianqiu and Sun Qingxian, appeared in court to defend him. As a result, the court ordered Chu Shijie to post a written guarantee of 500 yuan and bail out to wait for a witness and reschedule the hearing. Regarding the No. 15 bus that was sealed at the Hongqiao Station, the company repeatedly requested to be unsealed. The court considered that the car was no longer necessary to be sealed after the hearing the day before. Therefore, on the morning of the 11th of this month, it specifically ordered the chief of the judicial district to go to Hongqiao to unseal it, and obtain a receipt for filing. The car has now been driven back to the Yangzhou station for washing and repairs.</p>
<p>Nantong: Young Woman Commits Suicide After Encountering Violence in Hotel</p>
<p>Hu Shaoting, a lone young woman, checked into the Wanfulou Hotel in Pinghu. Local hooligans Zhou Zhenhua, Wang Jintang, Li Hanqing, and others, were amazed by her beauty and colluded to break into her room and threaten her, hoping to force her to be gang-raped. In a fit of desperation, Hu slammed her head against the wall and committed suicide. The travelers were outraged and rescued the woman and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who arrested Zhou Zhenhua and others and sent them to the court.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Private Collection of Silver Coins Leads to Prison Sentence</p>
<p>Jiaxing merchant Hong Weijin and others privately collected silver coins. After the party members learned about it, they, together with the Public Security Bureau, ordered the police to arrest Hong Weijin, Chen Xinqiao, Hong Fusheng, Wang Deye, He Baoquan, Chen Tongwen, Wang Chunyou, and seven others, and sent them to the local court for interrogation. After the prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law, Judge Feng questioned them separately and appointed lawyers to defend them separately. The verdict has been announced and the sentences were handed down separately on the 12th. The main text of the judgment is as follows: Hong Weijin, Chen Xinqiao, Hong Fusheng, and Wang Deye, attempted to illegally transport silver coins for profit but failed, each sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment. He Baoquan, Chen Tongwen, and Wang Chunyou, helped in the attempt to illegally transport silver coins for profit but failed, each sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: Chen Zhaoying Visits Xiaoshan for Inspection</p>
<p>Chen Zhaoying, a central committee member and inspector general of Fujian and Zhejiang, traveled by car from Zhuji on the 9th to inspect the political work of various counties in eastern Zhejiang. Accompanied by various inspectors, he arrived in Xiaoshan at 10:00 a.m. on the 11th. All sectors and legal entities of the county went to Xiaoshan Railway Station to welcome him. A welcome meeting was held in the auditorium of the county party headquarters. Chen was invited to give instructions. It was reported that hundreds of sand residents in the north county requested the Cotton Bureau to cancel the compulsory planting of millions of cotton, which resulted in no harvest and greater losses. Chen has instructed County Chief Zhang to handle it. He then went to the county government to inspect political work and then took a car to Shaoxing.</p>

<h3>Iron Ministry Notice: Measures for Transporting Legal Tender and Silver Coins; Compilation of Nine Key Points, Issued as an Order for Compliance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways yesterday issued an order to the National Railway Administrations nationwide, stating: Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, regarding matters such as people carrying silver coins, instructions to exchange them for legal tender, and the transportation of legal tender and silver coins, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated measures, which have been submitted to this Ministry for approval and issued to various railway lines for compliance. Now, to ensure that all stations understand the procedures and to facilitate implementation, we are compiling the key points of the previously issued orders and presenting them as follows:</p>
<p>Military and police in various locations, regarding people from areas where legal tender does not circulate carrying silver coins to purchase goods, should not confiscate them outright if it is confirmed that they are not smuggling for profit. However, they should instruct the receiving shops to submit them to the nearest exchange agency to exchange for legal tender.</p>
<p>Uninformed and ignorant people who do not understand government policies and are carrying silver coins should be immediately directed to the nearest exchange agency to exchange them for legal tender. Furthermore, those carrying silver coins to exchange agencies should not be intercepted en route.</p>
<p>The number of silver dimes allowed for passengers to carry has also been reiterated by the Ministry of Finance in its previous order. If they are not of inferior quality and light weight, regardless of single or double dimes, up to 300 coins are allowed for merchants to transport freely. If the above number is exceeded, a passport must be obtained; otherwise, it will be treated as smuggling.</p>
<p>At each railway station, if passengers use silver coins to purchase tickets, the ticket office should accept them. They should also inquire if, in addition to the ticket price, the passenger is carrying more than 300 silver coins or dimes. If so, they should instruct the passenger to hand them over to the ticket office of the station to be exchanged for legal tender. The station should then prepare separate lists for the silver coins used to purchase tickets and the silver coins/dimes exchanged for legal tender, and submit them to the nearest legal tender exchange agency to exchange for legal tender.</p>
<p>Railway transport of silver coins and silver materials is limited to agencies designated by the Ministry of Finance for exchanging legal tender. It must be verified that they possess a passport from the Ministry of Finance or a certificate from the legal tender exchange agency before transport is permitted. In addition, those purchasing silver materials in accordance with the regulations for managing silver used in silver products must also verify the certificate issued by the bank selling the silver materials when transporting them.</p>
<p>For the transport of legal tender cash, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are exempt from freight charges. Other banks and agencies acting as exchange agents for legal tender should be charged at a 50% discount according to Articles 105 (A) and (B) of the General Rules for Passenger Train Transport. There is no need to submit a price reduction voucher.</p>
<p>Legal tender refers only to banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Banknotes issued by other banks are not included. Except for the Farmers Bank of China transporting its own banknotes, which should still be charged at a 60% discount according to Article 105 (B) of the Passenger Transport Regulations as previously ordered, all banknotes other than legal tender should be charged the full amount according to the same article and item.</p>
<p>Dime notes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications should be handled in accordance with the procedures for transporting legal tender.</p>
<p>For free transport of legal tender and silver coins, miscellaneous passenger transport documents of this railway line should be used. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations have, after receiving the order, instructed their administrative offices to comply.</p>

<h3>Counselor of the Embassy in Turkey, Wang Pengsheng, Returns to China; Discusses the Situation in Turkey, Which Is Largely Similar to Ours; Unity from Top to Bottom Allows for Increasing Prosperity</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, Wang Pengsheng, Counselor of our country's Embassy in Turkey, departed from Ankara, the Turkish capital, on the 14th of last month, accompanied by his wife, on official business, traveling via Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, and Siberia, returning to China. On the 10th, he arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok on the Russian ship "Berkeley." After staying in Shanghai for three days, he took the 11:00 p.m. express train to Beijing last night, planning to visit President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang. Before his departure, Mr. Wang had a candid conversation with a reporter from the New Sound News Agency regarding the political situation in Turkey and the relationship between China and Turkey. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Unity From Top to Bottom</p>
<p>Mr. Wang first mentioned the rapid progress Turkey has made in the past sixteen years, transforming from a semi-colonial state to a completely independent nation. The root cause of this, he said, is nothing more than the unity of the people from top to bottom, working together with one heart and one mind. In terms of domestic policy, the Communist Party is strictly suppressed, but close cooperation has been achieved with the Soviet Union. Recently, after the London Economic Conference stalled, the Soviet Union lent the Turkish government US$8 million in one instance, to be repaid over 20 years without interest. Furthermore, repayment can be made with goods instead of cash. This method is tantamount to purchasing goods with advance payment. After obtaining this loan, Turkey used it entirely to build light industry and establish the foundation for heavy industry, leading to the increasing prosperity of domestic industry and commerce. As for businesses operated by foreigners within Turkey, such as railways, telephones, and water conservancy, they have all been gradually recovered, achieving complete economic independence and freeing themselves from the shackles of foreigners. Economic controls have also been implemented to balance imports and exports. Even foreign employees hired by the government are, according to Turkish law, not allowed to remit their income back in cash. They can only purchase Turkish goods to send to their families instead of cash. The Turkish people's thinking is close to our Three Principles of the People, such as the regulation of capital, large-scale enterprises being entirely state-owned, equalization of land ownership, and prohibition of speculation in real estate. The difference between it and communism lies in its cooperation with private capital, while private businesses must be subject to government restrictions. The difference from Pan-Nationalism lies in its intolerance of collectivism and its opposition to imperialism. It does not want to become an imperialist country itself. The difference with China is that it seeks international cooperation on an equal footing, rather than adopting the principle of universal brotherhood. It is an absolutely nationalist country. Any foreign organization, especially those related to culture, is prohibited from establishing branches in Turkey, as the country's independence is recent and it seeks to avoid the intrusion of foreign forces.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Victory</p>
<p>Turkish diplomacy can be divided into three stages. First, seeking national independence, namely during the Greco-Turkish War, focusing the country's strength to disperse the enemy's strength, implementing a strategy of defeating them one by one, and reaching compromises with France and Italy. Second, maintaining peaceful construction, namely stabilizing international relations, achieving cooperation in a spirit of equality, and laying the foundation for the country. Third, participating in national politics, such as concluding the Balkan Pact, joining the League of Nations, and signing a non-aggression treaty with Poland, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Turkey's current position is not only the center of the Balkan Peninsula, but also the linchpin of Central Asia and Southwest Asia.</p>
<p>China-Turkey Relations</p>
<p>The diplomatic relations between China and Turkey have a long history, dating back to the Xiongnu, Turks, and Uyghurs. Cultural relations deepened during the Song Dynasty. Later, the ethnic groups gradually migrated westward, and relations were interrupted for a long time. It was not until Genghis Khan led his troops westward that he attacked Ankara, where his relics still remain today. The current relationship began in the Qing Dynasty. When Guo Songtao, our country's first minister to the United Kingdom, was in office, the Turkish minister to the United Kingdom requested a treaty with Guo. Later, when Zeng Jize was envoy to France in the fourth year of the Guangxu reign, the Turkish ambassador to France also requested it. Unfortunately, the opportunity was missed at the time because the Russian Empire had occupied our Ili, and a war broke out between Russia and Turkey. If the two countries had a treaty, then Zuo Zongtang, Liu Jintang, and others would have had heavy troops stationed in Xinjiang, and if they had joined forces to attack Russia, the situation in Asia would not have been what it is today. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Turkish ambassador to Belgium again proposed a treaty with Wang Jingqi, our country's minister to Belgium. However, negotiations were suspended five or six times due to disagreements between the two sides. It was not until the spring of the 23rd year that Hu Shize, the minister to Switzerland, signed a friendship treaty with the Turkish government in Ankara.</p>
<p>Commercial Treaty Issue</p>
<p>Mr. Wang continued, stating that regarding the signing of a China-Turkey commercial treaty, the central government has instructed Hu Shize, the minister to Switzerland, to continue negotiations. Due to various reasons, it is still difficult to realize it at this time. The principles underlying Turkey's commercial treaties with various countries are threefold: 1. National responsibility (i.e., the other party is also a country with a planned economy); 2. Individual responsibility (individual claims); 3. National responsibility with joint individual claims (a compromise method). In my opinion, from our country's standpoint, the only principle to use when signing a commercial treaty with Turkey is the second one. The first and third are not suitable. As for the situation of our country's embassy in Turkey, everything is still good. The tasks of the embassy are originally: 1. Protection, such as protecting overseas Chinese and safeguarding the general material and spiritual interests of the country; 2. Negotiation, such as receiving instructions from the government and the embassy's own suggestions; 3. Observation, such as observing the situation in the host country and the opinions of the diplomatic corps in the host country on international relations. The current embassy in Turkey has been established for nine months and has achieved considerable results in the third task of observation, dividing it into half-year periods. The first period has been completed, and reports have been compiled and presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for publication in twenty volumes, bound into ten books. Due to the Turkish government's laws restricting the small professions of foreigners, and the professions of overseas Chinese belonging to small professions, many overseas Chinese have changed their nationality to Turkish in order to obtain the same treatment as Turks. There are now only ten overseas Chinese. The embassy is trying to remedy this. The Turkish diplomatic and press circles are very sympathetic to our country's current situation and hope that our country will strengthen itself.</p>

<h3>Committee on the Telephone Issue in the Special District; Second Board Meeting Yesterday; Requested the Taxpayers' Associations of the Two Concessions to Hold a General Meeting to Resolutely Protest and Achieve the Goal of Cancellation</h3>
<p>The Committee on the Telephone Issue in the Special District of this city held its second board meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. due to the impending implementation of the new system. More than 30 people attended, including Chen Jiufeng, Liu Zhongying, Lu Wenzhong, Zheng Dongshan, Wang Jingdong, Huang Xianggu, Mao Yun, Shao Xubai, Zheng Xiaolin, Sun Chucheng, Zhang Xianfang, Hu Fengxiang, Qu Zhenhua, Li Weiliang, Zhang Yichen, Li Kui, Wang Manyun, Zhu Yangwu, Gu Wensheng, etc. Zhang Yichen, Mao Yun, and Shao Xubai were elected as the presidium, and Zheng Dongshan took the minutes. Zhang Yichen first reported on the situation of the previous negotiations with the Municipal Council and the letters received from citizens expressing: (A) willingness to dismantle the machines; (B) refusal to pay the fees and willingness to have the lines cut; (C) united opposition to the company. The meeting then discussed the four reasons why the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession opposed the new system (already seen in yesterday's newspaper) and requested an expression of opinion. It was resolved to unanimously negotiate with the Municipal Council. Regarding the proposal of the Citizens' Federation to request the Taxpayers' Associations to convene a taxpayers' meeting, it was resolved to send letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Associations of the Public Concession and the French Concession to urge them to convene a general meeting as soon as possible to resolutely protest and achieve the goal of cancellation. Regarding the question of how to effectively express opposition to the impending implementation of the new system, it was resolved to send letters to various groups to unite and actively oppose it. Regarding the proposal to send personnel to conduct on-site inquiries about the opinions of users, it was resolved to pass it.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Decides to Thoroughly Reorganize; The Ministry of Communications Will Send Personnel to Shanghai to Oversee the Examination; Abolishing the Comprador System Will Begin With River Vessels</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, since the arrival of the new General Manager Cai Zengji, has decided to follow the four measures stipulated by the Ministry of Communications, first by holding examinations to screen personnel, then by reorganizing docks, warehouses, tea rooms, and sailors, and abolishing the comprador system. The details of each item are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Holding Examinations to Screen Personnel</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, General Manager Cai has decided to follow the reorganization measures stipulated by the Ministry of Communications, first by holding examinations to screen personnel. There are a total of 171 employees in the bureau, including 100 clerks. According to the new regulations, there should only be 60 to 70 clerks, so one-third must be reduced. Mr. Cai has personally ordered that each person's resume and the duties they have handled be reported in detail within two days, along with a two-inch photograph for review. It is heard that the examination will be overseen by personnel sent by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Decision to Abolish the Comprador System</p>
<p>The abolition of the ship comprador system has been implemented on the four new seagoing vessels under the previous General Manager Liu, such as the Yuanhengliding, as well as the Xinjiangtian on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and the Xinming and Xinfeng on the Shanghai-Yantai-Tianjin line. Mr. Cai has decided to abolish the comprador system as quickly as possible and to implement it on all ships under the bureau's jurisdiction. It will be abolished first on the Jianghua, Jiangshun, Jiangan, Jiangxin, Jianguo, Jiangda, and other vessels on the Yangtze River line, and replaced with pursers.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Branch Bureaus, Docks, and Warehouses</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has five Shanghai docks and warehouses, namely the South Dock, North Dock, New Dock, Middle Dock, and China Dock. Branch bureaus are located in places such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Yichang, Shashi, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Haizhou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and Ningbo, all of which also have docks and warehouses. It is heard that the bureau has also decided to find ways to reorganize them and improve the various facilities to make it very convenient for passengers and goods to go up and down.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Tea Rooms and Sailors on Various Ships</p>
<p>Tea rooms on ships have been demanding tips from passengers, especially on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and the Yangtze River line. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had previously received an order from the Ministry of Communications to reorganize them. Since the reorganization of the new Jiangtian vessel on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, extortion has been prohibited, and all tea room staff have been hired by the bureau and given a reasonable daily wage, which passengers have praised as convenient. The bureau will follow the example of the new Jiangtian vessel on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and find ways to reorganize the tea rooms and sailors on the various lines to eliminate long-standing abuses.</p>

<h3>Compilation of Reports on Merchant Ship Accidents</h3>
<p>Changtai Ran Aground; The Changtai vessel of the Antai Shipping Company is currently represented by Minxin. The vessel has a deadweight of 1,794 tons, a length of 278 feet and 2 inches, a width of 34 feet and 6 inches, a depth of 21 feet and 3 inches, and a draft of 16 feet and 6 inches. It was built in England in 1891. This time, it was loaded with cargo from the Yantai-Tianjin area and was going to Guangdong. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the shipowner Wang, stating that the vessel ran aground on the Dashiji sea area near Guangzhou at noon on the 11th due to fog. Because it was heavily laden, the ship has become stuck on the sandbar and cannot be moved. The Guangzhou branch manager has been asked to send tugboats to that location to unload the cargo and then try to salvage the vessel.</p>
<p>Chang'an Collided; The Chang'an vessel of the Lee Kee Shipping Company, which originally sailed the Shanghai-Tianjin route, has a deadweight of 1,492 tons, a length of 235 feet, a width of 32 feet, and a depth of 19 feet and 8 inches. On the 6th of this month, the vessel came from Guangzhou to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was sailing into the Huangpu River when it reached the Jiangmian of the Qichang Wharf. At that time, the Yuxing vessel of the Zhaoxing Company was berthed at that wharf loading cargo, and there were many barges alongside the Yuxing vessel that were loading and unloading cargo. The stern of the Chang'an vessel collided with one of the barges due to the tide. The barge was damaged, but fortunately, the damage was minor. The incident was reported to the Ship Insurance Joint Association yesterday, and they were asked to send personnel to inspect it.</p>
<p>Tongcheng Lost Blades; The Tongcheng vessel of the Tongcheng Shipping Company, which sails the North and South Ocean routes, had its yellow shipowner send a telegram yesterday morning stating that the vessel had encountered ice floes near Yantai. Due to the ice conditions, three blades of the engine on the Tongcheng vessel were damaged while sailing outside of Yantai. Each blade was one foot wide. At the time, the hull could not move. Fortunately, the vessel had spare blades, which were temporarily installed. The vessel is temporarily sailing to Dalian, and the Ship Insurance Joint Association will be asked to send personnel to inspect it before deciding on repairs.</p>
<p>Survey of Tongsheng; The Tongsheng vessel of the Datongxing Company ran aground on a reef in the Mafu Strait off Hainan Island and was severely damaged. The crew has all left the boat and gone ashore. The ship is currently in a very dangerous situation, and it is difficult to determine whether it can be salvaged. Tang Junhua of the China Ship Insurance Joint Association has decided to send Xu Zufan, a technician from the association, to inspect the vessel's current situation on the Haizhen vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, and then decide on a rescue plan. However, it is heard that the Tongsheng vessel is aground in a remote area frequented by pirates, so the association has telegraphed the authorities to send personnel to protect Mr. Xu on his trip.</p>
<p>Yongheng Escaped Danger; The Yongheng vessel of the Yongan Company, with a deadweight of 1,195 tons, encountered solid ice when it traveled from Shanghai to Tianjin this time and reached Dagukou. The Yongheng vessel only had 30 tons of coal on board and could not proceed, so it turned back to Yantai. Unexpectedly, it also encountered ice floes just outside the port of Yantai. At that time, the ship only had four tons of coal left. Fortunately, the EWO Nissho and Zhengji Shunli vessels ventured to break through the ice into Yantai, and the Yongheng also followed. However, it had no fuel left, so it had to burn more than 100 of the wood pilings on board to reach the port of Yantai. The Ruizhou vessel was also rescued from Dagukou and has arrived at Dalian Bay.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank; Receiving Preparations in Various Places</h3>
<p>According to the Kwomin News Agency, when the Ministry of Finance established the Reserve Committee for the issuance of banknotes by the China Farmers Bank, it was originally planned that the Bank of China would be responsible for receiving them on its behalf, but this did not happen. Recently, the China Farmers Bank received an order from the Ministry of Finance to prepare to issue 100 million yuan in banknotes for the purpose of using them in the same way as the legal tender issued by the three banks, and stipulated that half of the 50 million yuan must be used to relieve rural businesses. Therefore, the bank has now decided to handle mortgages and agricultural warehouses in various provinces along the Yangtze River, and to provide loans in various provinces in the Northwest. The branch offices in various provinces have begun to investigate the rural situation in order to proceed.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the local banks in various provinces and cities were previously entrusted to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications by the Reserve Committee for issuance. Now that the China Farmers Bank has been specially authorized by the government to issue banknotes and has branch offices throughout various remote areas, it is naturally suitable for receiving the businesses of local banks in various places. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the China Farmers Bank, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to receive the cash reserves and security reserves of local banks in various places separately.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factories United Association Submits Documents to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries Requesting an Allocation of 200 Million Yuan in Public Bonds for Mortgage Purposes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association yesterday submitted documents to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries, stating: "Our association held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members on February 7th of this year. Executive committee members Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Zilian, and others proposed submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries for the allocation of 200 million yuan in Rejuvenation Public Bonds to aid national goods factories. It stated that the Ministry of Finance announced the issuance of 136 million yuan in Unified Public Bonds and 34 million yuan in Rejuvenation Public Bonds as fundamental relief policies to reform the currency system, stabilize finance, and revitalize agriculture, industry, and commerce. All of us in the national goods industry should unanimously express our support. However, since the currency reform on November 4th of last year, all cash reserves in Chinese and foreign banks and money shops have been exchanged for legal tender. Cash in the hands of the people has disappeared from the market. Even if there are ignorant villagers who still have cash hidden away, the amount is already very small. Since last year, the currency in circulation has been insufficient. Since the implementation of legal tender, all banks and merchants issuing banknotes have stopped issuing them and the government is gradually recovering them to unify currency issuance. The government uses concentrated cash guarantees as the standard for issuing legal tender, so the concentrated cash is not much, and the issued legal tender is even more insufficient for market turnover. As a result, since this year, commercial banks and money shops have felt the lack of currency and are still taking tightening as their business policy for this year. Major industries, such as cotton, camel hair, textiles, printing, and dyeing factories, which stopped working last year and sought to resume work, are still stranded and have no way out. The losses of rent, interest, labor, and expenses for a year are unknown in the tens of millions. They cannot announce closure and abandon millions of yuan worth of machinery, houses, and property. But there are no buyers, and unemployed workers are crying for food, their livelihoods are about to be cut off. If this continues for another six months, it will inevitably become unmanageable. The only way to provide relief is to request the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries to allocate 200 million in Rejuvenation Public Bonds for the mortgage of all assets and goods of national goods factories. However, industrial control laws and regulations must be promulgated quickly, a cost accounting system must be strictly implemented, and the relevant industries must be responsible for organized and planned improvements, in order to achieve the goal of revitalizing industry and commerce. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your public decision," and so on, was proposed for discussion. It was resolved to submit the case to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries for review and approval to allocate 200 million yuan in Rejuvenation Public Bonds to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to exclusively manage the mortgage lending of movable and immovable property of national goods factories, and to request the Ministry of Industry to quickly promulgate industrial control laws and regulations and treat them strictly, so as to facilitate rectification, and so on, was on record. It is appropriate to record the case and submit a document to request your department to examine and verify it, and to quickly implement and approve it, which is truly..."</p>

<h3>Summary of the Annual Report of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession Last Year</h3>
<p>Anti-Smuggling in the Concession Has Now Started The Retention or Abolition of the Band Awaits Discussion at the Annual Meeting The Situation of White Russian Women Is Becoming More and More Serious The Chinese Authorities Attach Importance to the Municipal Administration of the Concession</p>
<p>The 1935 Annual Report of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has now been drafted and will soon be compiled into a volume together with the revenue and expenditure report for that year, the 1936 revenue and expenditure budget, and the annual reports of various departments for the scrutiny of taxpayers. In particular, the major events that occurred in the concession during the year are selected, translated into Chinese, and disclosed in the newspaper for the citizens to see first.</p>
<p>Election of Directors</p>
<p>The election of directors of the Municipal Council this year was held on March 25, 26, and 2. The elected directors were Yamamoto, Zhanbu, Liddell, Franklin, Carnay, Board, Gillerly, Lamb, Arnold, and other nine people. The Chinese election was held in mid-April. The elected directors were Chen Jie, Guo Pin, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, and Yu Qiaqing, and other five people. The directors took office on April 18. Arnold succeeded as the General Manager and Lamb as the Deputy. The members of the Standing Committee were also successively linked.</p>
<p>Sino-Foreign Relations</p>
<p>In late July of this year, the Municipal Council received an official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government, forwarding several copies of the announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Government on promoting Sino-foreign relations, requesting the concession authorities to post them in the concession. The announcement stated: "According to the order of the National Government, all Chinese citizens should promote diplomacy and should not have any remarks or behaviors that are anti-foreign or provoke international ill will, nor should they organize any political system for this purpose, so as to endanger diplomacy," etc. In order to promote goodwill and attach importance to etiquette, the concession authorities reiterated the reasons for the case, affixed the seal of the joint, and announced it throughout the concession. The French Concession also took the same action.</p>
<p>Anti-Smuggling in the Concession</p>
<p>The Chinese government's anti-smuggling law was promulgated in June 1934. Subsequently, the concession authorities, the consular corps of various countries, and the customs authorities repeatedly consulted on how to assist the Chinese side in cracking down on smuggling in the concession. Finally, the negotiations were completed in 1935. The Municipal Council agreed to assist the customs in searching Chinese merchants and merchants from countries without extraterritorial rights who have smuggled and concealed goods in the concession. However, the right to file a lawsuit should still be handled by the Legal Department of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Chinese Members of the Land Committee</p>
<p>The addition of two Chinese members to the Land Committee of the Municipal Council occurred in the resolution of the 1932 taxpayers' annual meeting. At that time, the Municipal Council suggested to the consular corps to slightly amend the provisions of the Land Regulations, and that this matter was to increase the rights and interests of Chinese citizens. The Chinese authorities should not object. However, the procedures for amending the Land Regulations were slightly slow. In 1935, the Chinese government recognized the Municipal Council's addition of two Chinese members to the Land Committee, and this matter came to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>Retention or Abolition of the Band</p>
<p>At the taxpayers' annual meeting this year, someone proposed that the Municipal Council stop running the existing band and hand it over to the Shanghai Choral Society or other equivalent organizations, with the Municipal Council subsidizing the expenses each year, not exceeding 150,000 yuan. However, this motion was not passed. Subsequently, the Music Committee of the Municipal Council organized a small committee to be responsible for investigating the reorganization of the band. On June 12, the Music Committee was ordered by the Board of Directors to review the existing band, whether it should be reorganized to save money, and whether it should retain a band equal to the existing organization. Later, the small committee suggested that the existing band should be stopped and another more economical band should be organized. It was also proposed that December 31 of this year be the date of dissolution of the band. The reason was that the cost of the band in 1934 was 278,500 yuan, and the rent of the concert hall and office were not included. According to the small committee's view, after the new band is established in the future, the expenses should not exceed 200,000 yuan (rent, etc. are not included), which can save more than 78,000 yuan per year. The Music Committee, based on the proposal of the above small committee, suggested to the Board of Directors to agree to the dissolution of the existing band. However, the dissolution date should be set as April 30, 1936, or other dates deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. After detailed discussion by the Board of Directors, it was deeply felt that the issue of the retention or abolition of the band should be subject to the free disposal of the taxpayers. Therefore, it was decided that this matter should be submitted to the 1936 taxpayers' annual meeting for them to dissolve, retain, or reorganize a new band. However, in order to facilitate the rapid implementation of the taxpayers' intentions, all contracts for band musicians and temporary musicians without contracts were stipulated to be terminated at the end of May 1936. In addition, it was decided that if the taxpayers approve the retention of a band equal to the number of the current band, the band should be organized in accordance with the outline formulated by the small committee of the Music Committee, that is, the band should have one leader, one deputy leader, one chief instructor of brass instruments, and 44 other musicians. Therefore, the issue of the retention or abolition of the Municipal Council band is now awaiting the decision of the 1936 taxpayers' annual meeting.</p>
<p>Suppression of Opium</p>
<p>According to the report submitted by the Municipal Council to the League of Nations, opium addiction in Shanghai was still deeply rooted in 1934. Although the use of opium has decreased, the use of other drugs, such as morphine and heroin, has almost replaced it with violence. Furthermore, there is still no registration method for opium addicts in the concession, so the number is still not properly counted. In 1935, 8,000 people were arrested for opium cases, of which more than 6,600 were convicted and more than 1,300 were released. The difficulty currently felt by the concession authorities in suppressing opium is that international drug traffickers are not people who personally carry out the business, so it is extremely difficult to arrest them, and they sometimes borrow nationalities and fabricate passports, which is a very complicated situation. The concession authorities can only do their best.</p>
<p>White Russian Women</p>
<p>Young women among White Russian refugees have long been a social problem in Shanghai. At the end of 1934, the Municipal Council received a request from the League of Nations to report the living conditions of White Russian women in the area to the League of Nations. In February of this year, the Municipal Council reported to the League of Nations that there were 2,000 adult White Russian women and 400 minor White Russian women in the area. Although there are no officially approved brothels in the Public Concession, it is estimated that 130 of the White Russian women are engaged in prostitution and 145 are occasionally engaged in prostitution. Eighty percent of these occasional prostitutes are dance partners in various dance halls. It is found that the first Russian brothels in the Public Concession occurred in 1905 and 1920. Russian refugees came from Siberia in groups, and Russian prostitutes spread throughout Shanghai. In 1931, the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, and Russian women flocked from Harbin, and the number of White Russian women engaged in prostitution greatly increased. By 1933 and 1934, the social economy became more and more depressed, and the situation of White Russian women became out of control. For the current plan, only the supply of low-priced housing and food can be a temporary solution. There are currently six private organizations that provide relief to White Russian women, and they have submitted the same report to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Municipal Internships</p>
<p>There is also one thing worth noting, that is, the Chinese National Government's dispatch of students to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to intern in municipal administration. This matter occurred at the suggestion of the Chinese Nanjing authorities the year before last. Subsequently, six Chinese students were sent to the bureau for internships, and were shown the methods of management and control, as well as other important knowledge of municipal administration. In addition, the Zhejiang Police Academy requested in March of this year to send personnel to intern in fire administration. In mid-April, the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau requested to send personnel to the bureau to intern in fingerprint inspection and firearms inspection. The Fire Department and the Police Department of the Municipal Council provided considerable internship convenience. This kind of cooperation is generally appreciated by the Chinese authorities, and the Chinese authorities' emphasis on the administrative policy of the concession can also be seen from this.

<h3>Lawyers Association Preparations for the Seventh Congress</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee members of the seventh congress of the National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China, Zhang Shijie, Xu Zuoliang, Yan Yinwu, Zhou Shiying, Wu Guochang, and other ten people, have been preparing separately in recent days, and have arranged all the equipment in the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession.

<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Decides to Dredge the Quan River in Shandong</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at No. 505 Henan Road, at the request of the magistrate of Wenshang County, Shandong Province, to dredge the Quan River, sent Deputy Engineer Zhang Jichun of the Engineering Department to inspect and prepare a plan, requesting an allocation of 27,000 yuan to carry out work relief, which was submitted to the Executive Committee for discussion, etc. The news has been reported before. It is now heard that the conference has decided to allocate 25,500 yuan and 1,000 bags of flour to the Engineering Department to handle it jointly with the Wenshang County Government, and sent Chief Auditor Dr. Ji Luyi to contact the county magistrate in advance and then start work. According to the person in charge of the conference, Chairman Han of Shandong Province, because the Wanzhao and Zhao Wang River embankments in western Shandong have been in disrepair for many years, have recently been breached by floods, and the victims are waiting for relief anxiously. He sent a letter requesting an allocation of 200,000 yuan to provide work relief and engage in construction.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Ruling: Manager Reimbursement Forms Exempt from Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, based on a telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce inquiring whether reimbursement forms from branch managers of kerosene businesses and reports between headquarters and branches should be affixed with stamps, requested instructions. The Ministry of Finance replied, "We have received the telegram. Upon investigation, if the organization and capital of the kerosene business managers and general managers do not belong to the same entity, then the reimbursement forms submitted by the managers to the general manager cannot be considered internal documents. However, these documents differ in nature from the account books in item three and the documents used for manager transactions in item seven of the tax rate table. They are similar to the case where the Shangchuan Transportation Company reported the total number of joint transportation tickets sold to the Shanghai Ferry General Administration, which was exempt from stamp duty. Therefore, according to Article 3, Item 9 of the Stamp Tax Law, there is no need to affix stamps. Please inform accordingly." This concludes the ruling.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Genuine from Counterfeit New Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>Use a Magnet to Instantly Determine Authenticity; Nickel Coins Difficult to Mint, Making Counterfeiting Virtually Impossible</p>
<p>Since the issuance of the new subsidiary coins, people from all walks of life have been eager to see them first. However, some people are concerned about counterfeiting. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency interviewed a coinage expert about how to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit coins. The expert replied as follows:</p>
<p>Nickel coins are made of pure nickel. Using a magnet, authenticity can be instantly determined. Genuine coins will be attracted, while counterfeit coins will not. Even if mixed with iron, they may be attracted, but the color will be different.</p>
<p>Nickel coins have a shiny color and a clear sound. If mixed with other metals such as aluminum or iron, the color will be dull and the sound will be muffled, making them easy to identify.</p>
<p>Nickel coins are durable and not easily engraved.</p>
<p>Pure nickel requires a temperature of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit to melt, requiring sophisticated machinery for minting. Counterfeiters, being private operators, will not have such equipment. Furthermore, the government strictly prohibits counterfeiting currency, and anyone found doing so will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit New Subsidiary Coins Discovered</h3>
<p>The new subsidiary coins issued by the Ministry of Finance on the 10th of this month saw a rush of citizens seeking to exchange them at exchange shops, which were unable to cope with the demand. Unexpectedly, only two days later, counterfeit coins were discovered on the market, including 20-cent and 10-cent coins. The sound of the 20-cent coins was slightly sharper than the genuine coins, and the patterns were indistinguishable from the genuine coins. However, the counterfeit coins had fine lines on the edge, while the genuine coins were smooth. Therefore, the mint secretly investigated, and it was heard yesterday that the concession authorities had cracked down on the perpetrators of this private minting of counterfeit coins. It is expected that this will no longer disrupt the currency.</p>

<h3>New Facts in Gu Zhuxuan Case: Guard Takes Bribe and Escapes</h3>
<p>Two Guards Escaped Together, Court Has Issued Arrest Warrants, Two Others Involved Have Been Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng and Wang Xinggao from Funing, the main criminals in the case of inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, were previously informed on by the perpetrators Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui (also known as Xiao Sizi). The French Concession Police arrested Gu and Wang and brought them to the Second Special Court for prosecution. Gu was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, and Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment. Both criminals refused to accept the verdict and filed appeals with the Third Branch of the High Court. The Third Branch of the High Court heard both cases on the same day, on the 4th of this month, and announced the end of the debate, with the sentencing scheduled for the afternoon of the 11th (the day before yesterday). Unexpectedly, during this period, the Third Branch of the High Court discovered that Gu, who was detained at Guangci Hospital, had bribed the guards sent by the Second Special Prison and colluded with the director to buy off Zhao and Zhang, the original informers, to recant their testimony. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the two guards and a director escaped with the money, a new fact that led the Third Branch of the High Court to temporarily revoke the end of the debate and order further investigation before rescheduling the debate and hearing. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the escaped guards, Ma Xiancai (also known as Xiancai, 40 years old) and Ma Xianxiang (also known as Xianxiang, 32 years old), are brothers from Guoyang, Anhui. One filed a one-week leave request with the Second Special Prison, while the other did not file a leave request. The two took the opportunity to escape together. The Third Branch of the High Court has ordered the Second Special District Court to issue arrest warrants and instructed the French Concession Police to send detectives to arrest them. Another director, Wang Yucai, took a long leave of absence two weeks before the discovery and returned to his hometown. The Third Branch of the High Court has ordered the Second Special Prison to order Wang to report to the court within a deadline. In addition, the guards Wang Bogang and Jia Furong, who are suspected of being involved, have been detained for interrogation. It is heard that the Third Branch of the High Court has transferred this case to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court for investigation. The appeal cases of Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao have been extended for two months of investigative detention by the presiding judge with the approval of the Criminal Court Director. After receiving the order from the High Court, Qiao Wanxuan, the Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court, went to the Second Special Prison on Masnan Road in the afternoon of the day before yesterday to conduct a thorough investigation. He left the prison at around 7 pm. It is heard that the court will formally begin investigating the detained guards and Zhao and Zhang in the near future. It is also heard that Zhang Tinggui, also known as Xiao Sizi, a prisoner of the Second Special Prison, has prepared a detailed report revealing the inside story and submitted it to the Third Branch of the High Court for verification.</p>
<h3>Spring Infectious Diseases Have Been Discovered in This City</h3>
<p>Health Bureau to Hold Vaccination Campaign Starting the 16th</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the vast area of this city and the mixed population, in order to prevent the occurrence of smallpox, has decided to dispatch doctors from the bureau to schools, factories, and shantytowns to carry out a large-scale vaccination campaign starting from the 16th of this month. The period is temporarily set for three months. In addition, spring epidemics such as smallpox, scarlet fever, and diphtheria have been discovered in this city recently due to the sudden changes in the weather.</p>
<h3>Three Nights of Spring Cold, Five Beggars Frozen to Death</h3>
<p>Since the 8th of this month, the city has turned bitterly cold, especially at night, resulting in beggars who sleep on the streets being frozen to death. The Daily News reporter inquired at the Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the French Concession Ningbo Road and learned that from the 8th to the 11th, a total of three nights, in the area of Nine Acres in Nanshi, where beggars gather, five people who had no clothes to keep warm were successively frozen to death. Some of them also suffered from simultaneous opium addiction attacks. However, the deceased beggars have all been provided with coffins and collected by the Fuyuan Hall.</p>
<h3>More Than Seventy Anhui Refugees Begging in Western Shanghai, Conflict with Villagers and Militia Yesterday</h3>
<p>Children Damaged Bamboo Fence, Nearly Causing a Disaster, Leaders of Both Sides Have Been Sent to Public Security Bureau for Questioning</p>
<p>The New Voice News reports that more than seventy refugees from Anhui Province came from Pudong to the Yingrui Temple in Zhoujiaqiao, Western Shanghai, to stay temporarily. Yesterday afternoon at 2 pm, while begging along Hongqiao Road to Chengjiaqiao, a child damaged one of the bamboo fences in the villagers' vegetable field, which was seen by the villagers and caused a dispute. The Puxong District Security Corps intervened and clashed with the refugees. At that time, more than 2,000 villagers and more than 40 militiamen surrounded all the refugees. Because the refugees snatched the villagers' sticks, the security corps fired ten shots, injuring Fang Dajing's right arm with a bullet and Wang Heping's right eye with a knife. The Caojiadu Public Security Sub-bureau was reported and immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to suppress the situation. They took the three violent militiamen and the refugee representatives Guo Fengming and Wang Heping to the bureau and transferred them to the general bureau for investigation. After the incident, the security corps discovered that a gun was missing and had been sent to the First Police Station of the Sixth District by the refugees. The refugee group, feeling unjustly humiliated, decided to request relief from the party and government authorities.</p>
<h3>The First District Office of the County Plans to Establish a Township Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>The New People's News reports that the First District Office of Shanghai County has recently felt that tombs are scattered throughout the countryside, wasting farmland and affecting farmers' income. Therefore, it had planned to build a township public cemetery to remedy the situation, but it was delayed due to various matters. Recently, it was urged by the Fengxian County Council. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at yesterday's district affairs meeting. After careful deliberation by the township chiefs, there were appropriate plans for the location, scope, funding, and construction, so it will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaoliang, the Comprador of Hongsheng Foreign Firm, Is Accused</h3>
<p>Xu Guilin's Eight Diamond Ornaments Implicate Her Brother Xu Zhiyun</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoliang, also known as Shenghe, the comprador of the Hongsheng Foreign Firm in Ningbo Road, was inexplicably ambushed by petty criminals last year, who threw filth at him. The perpetrators escaped on the spot and were not captured. Unexpectedly, Wang Xiaoliang was recently sued by Sang Quansan, a Ningbo businessman who deals in military uniforms, through lawyer Chen Tingrui, for fraud in the First Special Court. The main point of the suit was that Sang had previously been pledged eight diamond ornaments belonging to Xu Guilin, the sister of his friend Xu Zhiliang, for a large sum of money. Later, he was unable to redeem them, and Sang confiscated them. Afterwards, Xu Guilin discussed with Sang and requested redemption, but to no avail. Not long ago, Wang Xiaoliang, who was familiar with Xu's sister Guilin, specially introduced Chen Shanrong, the manager of the Xinchang Woolen Shop, who knew Sang, to Sang and claimed that he wanted to buy the diamond ornaments. The price was agreed at over ten thousand yuan, with five thousand yuan to be paid upon delivery. Sang sent the eight diamond ornaments. However, Wang suddenly said that he did not have enough money at the moment, so he only paid four thousand three hundred and thirty yuan, and Xu promised to pay the rest. Sang did not suspect anything because Wang was a comprador. Who knew that Wang later went back on his word, saying that he was entrusted by Xu Guilin, the sister of Xu Zhiliang, to redeem the diamond ornaments from Sang for four thousand three hundred and thirty yuan, and was not the buyer. Now the diamond ornaments have been returned to their original owner, who has handed them over to Xu Guilin to take away. Sang felt that Wang Xiaoliang's actions were obviously fraudulent. However, because they were both respected businessmen, he had first asked the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to mediate, but the mediation failed, so he had no choice but to file a lawsuit. This case has been repeatedly subpoenaed by Judge Ye Shengchao. Yesterday afternoon, witness Xu Zhiliang was summoned to the court to testify that the diamond ornaments were first pledged by him to Sang and redeemed in July of the 23rd year of the Republic. The next day, Sang borrowed them from him because Sang had an urgent need, stating that he would return them within a month, but they were never returned. After hearing the testimony, the court asked Xu that since he had stated that he would return them within a month when borrowing them, why had he not contacted them for more than a year since July of the 23rd year of the Republic, and had been sued by Sang first? Xu was speechless at this point, and his testimony was vague. The court believed that further investigation was necessary and decided to postpone the case for a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Ximen Detective Team Received Report, Arrested Seven Bandits</h3>
<p>Woman Bandit Sent Guns, Committing Robbery Cases Every Day, Seven Bandits Arrested, Three Bandits Still at Large</p>
<p>Li Xiaobao, the captain of the detective team of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Qian Tianxiong, the deputy captain, received a secret report from detective Lu Qingkang yesterday that the bandits who robbed Chen Shunbao's wife, Da Ajie, of valuables from the bamboo shop at the intersection of Fangxie Road and Dalin Road on the afternoon of the 9th of this month at 6:30 pm, and seized a potted cannon and six bullets from patrol officer Hu Muxia at No. 21, were also planning to rob Zhabei, etc. Li, the team leader, led Liu Changpei, Yu Ruhai, detectives Lu Qingkang, Jin Yushan, Liu Wenhui, Zhao Renxin, Gu Junqing, Chen Mingsheng, and Chen Enrong in disguise, went to Zhabei and secretly went to the Hengjue Road Vegetable Market in conjunction with the police of the Fourth District and the First Police Station. They waited until after 6 pm at night before they saw two men and one woman, who resembled bandits, approaching them. They immediately went forward and intercepted them. After questioning, they learned that their names were Xu Heshun, 20 years old, from Yancheng. The police officer Hu Muxia's lost box cannon No. 68092 and six bullets were found on his person. Two six-inch white wolf forest pistols and fifteen bullets with gun numbers 169 and 885 were found on the woman Chen Wang (also known as Zhou Wang, 30 years old, from Yancheng). They then apprehended a man named Zhang Bao, 30 years old, from Funing, and brought them to the Ximen Branch for interrogation. According to the woman Chen Wang, her husband Zhou Yitong and she bought three six-inch pistols and some bullets from Wu Er (also known as Wu Fugui, who has been assassinated) for 120 yuan on December 1st. On the 6th of this month, a fellow villager, Zheng Xiaoshou, borrowed a gun from them. She took two guns to the wasteland on Ouyang Road and handed them to Zheng Xiaoshou at about 5 pm that afternoon. Later, they went to rob Mao Qingfa's cigarette and paper shop at No. 26 Ouyang Road. That night, they returned the pistol to her at the same place. They gave her three yuan. On the 7th of this month, Yang Defu drew a line, and Yang Debao, Zheng Xiaoshou, Xu Xueqing, her husband Zhou Yitong, and others went to rob a police officer's house at No. 23 Yixing Lane, Changan Road, at 7 pm. Yang Defu took two pistols from her and robbed a gold ring, a gold lock, and thousands of yuan in cash, and also robbed the police officer's pistol. She and her husband Zhou Yitong each received ten yuan. On the 8th of this month, Yang Defu drew another line, and Yang Defu gathered Xiao Mao, Xu Xueqing, Xiao Kuazi, Zhou Yitong, Sun Xiaoyou, Zhang Bao, and others to rob Chen Shunbao's house at the intersection of Dalin Road, after Fangxiehou Road, at about 7 pm. They also robbed a box cannon and six bullets from nearby patrol officer Hu Muxia. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, Zheng Xiaoshou borrowed a gun from her again. She took two guns to the back of the rickshaw company on Ouyang Road and handed them to Zheng Xiaoshou at 6 pm. Unexpectedly, three of them were caught by detectives on Wuhua Road, and Zheng Xiaoshou took the two pistols and disappeared without a trace. At 2 pm today, they wanted to go to Zhabei to rob again. She took three pistols from her house and asked Zhang Bao to take them to Xiqiao and ask Xu Heshun to send them to Zhabei. She and Sun Xiaoyou went to Zhabei to wait, but were arrested in the middle of the road, etc. The detectives then went to the French Concession, together with the police, to No. 2 Xinmin Lane, Bair Road, and arrested Zhou Tongde and the suspects Zhang Yijiang and Wang Liangyu. They also arrested Sun Xiaoyou, a member of the gang, in a flat in Xinqiao Road, Nanshi. They will strictly arrest the fugitives Yang Defu, Zheng Xiaoshou, and Xu Xueqing, and will send the seven male and female bandits, a box cannon, and two pistols to the general bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Hengchangxiang Shipyard Property Dispute Continues</h3>
<p>Yuan Ludeng Testifies, Says Xie Lianqing Did Not Embezzle</p>
<p>Zhang Yanzhong, the deceased owner of the Hengchangxiang Machinery Shipyard on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, left behind an estate of over a million taels of silver nine years ago. At that time, a management committee was formed, and Xie Lianqing was publicly elected as chairman. Last winter, Zhang's widow, Zhang Wu, filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Xie Lianqing of embezzling the managed assets. The court had summoned him several times without a resolution. Details had been reported previously. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Judge Chen Jingyi presided over the continued hearing in the Twelfth Tribunal. Neither party appeared, only the lawyers for both sides, Peng Yuanxun and Wang Jianhang, and the witness Yuan Ludeng, were present. Yuan Ludeng testified that Xie Lianqing did not embezzle anything. He stated that he was related to the late Zhang Yanzhong through their children's marriage and was also a good friend of Xie Lianqing. Therefore, regarding the civil lawsuit, he was willing to be responsible for resolving it outside of court. The judge then adjourned the hearing for a later date.</p>
<h3>Concubine Commits Suicide After Husband's Death</h3>
<p>Efforts to Save Her Fail; Dies in Hospital</p>
<p>Liu Lieqing, a native of Anhui residing at 25 Mingde Lane, Foch Road in the French Concession, passed away on the 8th of this month at the age of sixty-two. He had previously served as the commander of the 16th Division of the Army. During his life, Liu had taken Zhuang Jing (age thirty-three) from Dongtai as a concubine. The bond between husband and concubine was very strong, but Liu Zhuangjing's relationship with her stepchildren was not very harmonious. Now, after the death of her husband, Liu Lieqing, overwhelmed with grief and fearing the hardship of future life and inevitable mockery, she conceived a desire to end her life. After the funeral of Liu was completed, at 4:00 AM on the 11th, she secretly took sleeping pills in her room to commit suicide to follow her husband in death. It wasn't until noon that Liu's eldest son, Liu Tao-fu (age thirty-three, working at the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank), discovered her. He immediately rushed her to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road. However, due to the deep poisoning of her internal organs, efforts to save her were unsuccessful, and she died in the hospital at 1:30 AM yesterday morning. The hospital, as usual, reported the incident to the Foch Road Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate.  The body was then transported to the Tongren Foyuan branch for an autopsy. Yesterday, prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the scene. The autopsy confirmed that Liu Zhuangjing died from taking poison. The deceased's son, Liu Tao-yong, and her brother, Zhuang Zhefu, were brought in to testify. They stated the process of discovering the deceased's suicide attempt, sending her to the hospital for treatment, and requested to claim the body for burial. The court ordered that the body be released to the son of the deceased, Liu Tao-fu, after providing a written guarantee for the coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Huishan Police Smash Mobile Gambling Den</h3>
<p>Moving Over Ten Times, Police Capture Owners and Gamblers</p>
<p>Recently, a man named Xiao Qing, who is a minor owner of a bathhouse in the jurisdiction of the Huishan Police Station, organized a mobile gambling den, moving the location several times a day, making it difficult for law enforcement to track down. On the 3rd of this month, Zhou Guisen, the Chinese Detective Chief of the police station, and detective Zhao Yongqing, learned that they were gambling at 76 and 96 Tangshan Road and taking a cut of the winnings. They reported this to the First Special Court and obtained a search warrant and rushed to arrest them, but the gambling den had already moved to another location, and they found nothing. Chief Detective Zhou and others secretly dispatched personnel to continue the investigation, discovering that since the 3rd, they had moved more than ten times, including 75, Lane 313, Tangshan Road; 21 and 41, Lane 310, same road; 32, Lane 466, same road; 32, Lane 341, same road; 51, Lane 349, Zhoushan Road; 51, Lane 369, same road; 51, Lane 598, Dongyouheng Road, and other locations. The afternoon before yesterday, they moved to 58, Lane 1041, East-West Huade Road. Fearing that the den would have moved again after applying for a search warrant from the court, Chief Detective Zhou, in accordance with Article 131, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, took emergency measures. At 3 PM, he led the detectives to raid the gambling den and successfully broke it up. A total of eighteen people were captured, including the owner, Wang Caimao, and gamblers Zhu Miaogen, Zhang Shifa, Wang Xiaotu, He Miaosheng, and women Li Yuebin and Wang Miao. The gambling tools and cash were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Gouji prosecuted them under Article 268 of the Criminal Law and other crimes. Judge Ye Shengchao interrogated them and imposed severe penalties on each of them as a warning.  In addition, Lu Dagong, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Lao Zha Police Station, learned that some people were gambling and taking a cut of the winnings in room 124 of the New Shanghai Hotel at 79 Xiangfen Lane.  At 12:15 AM yesterday morning, he led the detectives to arrest them.  Seventeen gamblers, including Wu Guitang, Chen Zuoxing, and Shen Lao Er, were arrested in the room, along with gambling tools and cash, and taken to the police station.

<h3>Aftermath of Corpse Relocation Case: Fan Lushun Sues for Defamation</h3>
<p>Yuan Shunfeng, a native of Jiangbei, was in a difficult situation late last year when his wife, Wang, gave birth and there was no one around to assist. As a result, both the mother and child died.  Yuan was unable to afford coffins and burial.  Late at night, he asked his fellow rickshaw puller, Yang Quan-gou, to carry the two corpses of Wang and the infant and abandon them near the Qingxin Middle School outside the Dananmen gate.  The next day, the Procuratorate of the District Court sent personnel to examine the corpses, which were then inspected by a coffin dealer.  The police station in charge of the area investigated the circumstances and detained Yuan and others at the District Court for questioning. Unexpectedly, Fan Lushun, who runs a rickshaw company, recently filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Shen Jinchu, a detective of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, of defamation.  He stated that during the Lunar New Year, the plaintiff went to Wuxi to collect debts.  Suddenly, Shen Jinchu and several others came to the rickshaw company to inquire, suspecting the plaintiff of committing a crime.  The plaintiff only learned of the situation after returning home.  The defendant was clearly suspected of defamation, and therefore he was suing according to the law.  After receiving the complaint, the court, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, sent Judge Tan Zhuohong to the Eleventh Tribunal to summon the parties for questioning.  The plaintiff, Fan Lushun, recounted the facts of the complaint.  Shen Jinchu stated that after the corpse relocation case occurred, the people who moved the corpses were quickly identified.  Yuan Shunfeng was first arrested, and he confessed that Wang's corpse was actually carried out and abandoned by Yang Quan-gou, a rickshaw puller from Fan Lushun's water transport business, and that Yang Quan-gou was on the run.  Therefore, at 10:30 AM on January 23rd, Team Leader Qiu Yifan and Squad Leader Gao Wansheng led the defendant to Fan Lushun's rickshaw company to inquire whether Yang Quan-gou was pulling rickshaws in the company.  Unexpectedly, the company denied it.  Subsequently, Yang Quan-gou was arrested by the patrolmen of the Xundaoyuan Street Police Station, who confirmed that Yang was indeed pulling rickshaws at the company.  Therefore, the defendant's inquiry with the team leader and others was in accordance with the proper procedures and was a false accusation. He pleaded for an investigation.  The judge concluded that there was a misunderstanding on the plaintiff's part.  Fan Lushun withdrew the lawsuit in court, and the judge approved the withdrawal. Both parties signed the case file.</p>

<h3>Bank Clerk and Old Accountant Collude to Embezzle 5,000 Yuan, Altering "Immediately" to "Cash" for Unauthorized Withdrawal, Colleagues Pursue and Report to Police, Suspects and Stolen Money Recovered</h3>
<p>Yuan Kang Shen Bank at 12 Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, had business dealings with the Shanghai Bank. Yesterday morning, Jin Jipu, the bank's accountant, wrote a note requesting "5,000 yuan to be opened immediately," instructing a clerk to go to the Shanghai Bank to collect bank drafts.  However, Liu Jianzhi, a clerk from Yangzhou, harbored malicious intent. He secretly changed the word "immediately" (卽) on the note to "cash" (鈔), and colluded with Ding Buheng, an old accountant, to withdraw the money. Ding then took the note to the Shanghai Bank, withdrew 5,000 yuan in cash, and then Liu and Ding fled together to Liu's home at 15 Qingyu Lane, Chengdu Road. Liu kept 2,000 yuan, and the remaining 3,000 yuan was temporarily kept by Ding for future distribution and use. However, Jin Jipu, the accountant of Yuan Kang Shen Bank, became suspicious after waiting for Ding Buheng for a long time. He inquired with the Shanghai Bank by telegram, and only then learned that the note had been altered and the cash had been withdrawn. As he was investigating, Xu Fulin, another old accountant of the bank, saw Ding Buheng walking on the road while shopping on Meibai Ge Road. He secretly followed Ding, saw him enter 100, Lane 345, North Chengdu Road, and reported this to the New Gate Police Station.  Chinese detective Yang Peizhang was dispatched to arrest Ding, and 3,000 yuan in stolen money was found on him.  Based on Ding's confession, Liu Jianzhi was arrested, and another 2,000 yuan in cash was found.  Both were taken to the police station for detention.  Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court.  Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for embezzlement under Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and explained the previous circumstances. Yuan Kang Shen Bank commissioned lawyer E Sen to appear in court to file a private prosecution, requesting that all 5,000 yuan of the recovered stolen money be returned first. Jin Jipu also testified to everything.  When questioned, the two defendants, Ding and Liu, confessed without denying. Liu also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, requesting permission to be released on bail. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confessions and stated that the case also involved the suspicion of forgery. He ordered that the altered note be retrieved from the Shanghai Bank. Ding was ordered to remain in custody, and Liu was allowed to be released on bail of 3,000 yuan, and the hearing was adjourned for seven days. The recovered 5,000 yuan in cash was allowed to be returned first.</p>

<h3>The Nineteenth Aviation Lottery First Prize Was Sold in Bulk by the Dayun Company</h3>
<p>The Winner's Name Will Be Announced in One Week; Ticket Purchasers Must Pay Attention to Lottery Tickets Sold Across Provinces</p>
<p>The first prize of the 19th Aviation Highway Construction Lottery, number 110582, was sold by the cash wholesale department of the Shanghai Dayun Company. The reporter made a special trip to inquire yesterday and learned that the cash wholesale department of the company is specially set up for a portion of non-guaranteed lottery ticket recipients and small retail households without fixed locations. The method of bulk sales is to sell tickets for cash at any time. This type of bulk buyer is actually a temporary sales agent, with a very small number of tickets sold and frequent interruptions, so the names of the bulk buyers are not listed, and instead, the general term of cash wholesale records is used. The name of the lottery ticket sales agent who sold this first prize will be difficult to determine for a while, and will only be known in detail after the winner claims the prize one week later. This is because the office regulations stipulate that prizes can only be awarded one week after the lottery draw. According to the general manager of the Shanghai Dayun Company for the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Sichuan, all aviation lottery tickets sold within the six provinces have the Dayun Company seal on them, and the tickets sold in each province also have another seal indicating the sales region, such as (Sichuan region sales, Hubei region sales, Jiangxi region sales, central Anhui region sales, northern Anhui region sales, etc.) circular seals, for identification and restricted areas. If an aviation lottery ticket without the Dayun Company seal is found to be sold within the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Sichuan, it is a counterfeit lottery ticket sold across provincial boundaries. Shanghai should pay attention. If such sales are discovered in the market, Dayun Company can uniformly pursue compensation for losses and disqualify the sales agents from other provinces according to law. It is hoped that lottery ticket merchants and purchasers will pay attention.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing to clarify a news item in today's newspaper regarding my encounter with a pickpocket who snatched a wallet containing 150 yuan when I was leaving the New Light Theater. The facts are incorrect. In reality, due to the crowd when leaving the theater, I lost my wallet on the ground. The next morning, someone threw it into the courtyard of my office. The money inside was all there. I am writing to correct this in case of misunderstanding. Sincerely, Jin Yu, Puyi Real Estate Company, February 12th. To the Editor, We have read today's report on the case against Mr. Grayford, General Manager of the Mei Feng Bank, which stated that Mei Feng Bank and its three related companies went bankrupt on May 24th of last year. It is true that Mei Feng Bank, Raven Trust Company, and Mei Dong Bank Company went bankrupt on that day, but Puyi Real Estate Company continues to operate at 110 Sichuan Road to this day. We hope you will correct this. Sincerely, Puyi Real Estate Company, 12th.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Shanghai Tung Oil Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit</p>
<p>(No. 13 of the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview)</p>
<p>2.  Domestic Sales — Besides white oil, red oil is also a major product in domestic sales of tung oil, while refined oil is very minimal. The sales range in Shanghai can be divided into three areas: The North China Group, including Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, specializes in selling large barrels of capital oil; the Inland Group, including Su, Jin, Hang, Jia, Hu, and other places, specializes in selling red oil; the Chongsha Group, including Chongming and Nantong areas, specializes in selling red oil and Zhejiang oil. Oil sales are divided into three periods: spring sales, summer sales, and autumn sales, with summer sales being the most prosperous. However, in recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and domestic sales of tung oil have been sluggish throughout the year. In the past, during peak periods, Shanghai's red oil sales could reach hundreds of thousands of barrels per year, but last year only 25,000 barrels were sold. The decline of social economy and weak purchasing power are the main reasons, but the reduction in Hakka production is also one of the reasons. It is said that in Hongjiang County, the annual turnover of red oil exports was 7 million yuan ten years ago, but it has now been reduced to 2 million yuan. Amidst this sharp decline in sales, competitors still compete by lowering prices, so the business strategy tends to shrink.</p>
<p>As for the transportation of tung oil, foreign ships monopolize all exports. In recent years, foreign shipping companies have added oil tanks to their new ships, so transportation to the United States has been changed to bulk transport, which is both economical and convenient, with a freight rate of two yuan and eight jiao per dan. Transportation to Europe still uses wooden or iron barrels, with a freight rate of eight yuan and five jiao per dan. Domestically, in the upper reaches of our country, the transportation ships from the production area to the concentration area are also mostly foreign ships, because there is not a single Yangtze River ship in our country with oil tank equipment. Ordinary mountain transport from Wanxian to Hankou costs two yuan and one jiao per dan, including donations and taxes. The freight rate from Hankou to Shanghai by Swire or China Merchants ships is one yuan and eight jiao and five fen per dan. The freight rate for Zhejiang oil from Shanghai to Hangzhou by car is five jiao and six fen per ju (net weight of 124 jin per city scale).</p>
<p>(3) Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>The market price of tung oil depends on the abundance of domestic production, the increase or decrease of foreign sales, the rise and fall of the gold and silver ratio, and the domestic political stability. The price of white oil in the 10th year of the Republic of China was 28 yuan per dan. Although there have been ups and downs over the years, it was still around 27 or 28 yuan per dan in the 20th year of the Republic of China. In recent years, the changes have been drastic. It used to be difficult to see a difference of more than one or two yuan, but now there are often fluctuations of four or five yuan. In April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, a low point of 18 yuan was found, and in September of the 24th year of the Republic of China, a high price of 85 yuan appeared. This market price is also manipulated by foreign merchants. There is no direct export agency in the country, and tung oil merchants cannot contact each other to seek common defense. After the summer of last year, the price of oil continued to rise, but at that time, it happened to be the time when the old and new were not connected, and the oil in stock had already been cleared, so the price increase was only in name, and the oil merchants still had no real benefits. The red oil market has plummeted in the past ten years, and there is no seasonality to speak of.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the market price of tung oil is based on Hankou and Hangzhou for white oil, and Zhenjiang for red oil. Although the industry has agreed on a public market, the wholesale prices are still inconsistent. Taking white oil as an example, sometimes the selling price in Shanghai is cheaper than in Hankou and Hangzhou, because the oil quality varies. Red oil dealers are stationed in Hongjiang, Changde, Hankou, and Zhenjiang. The dealers in Zhenjiang are responsible for promoting sales and opening the market. Before each spring sale, they announce the selling price, called the first market, and before the summer sale, they open the market again, called the second market. The selling price of red oil in Shanghai is based on the first and second markets in Zhenjiang, but due to the competitive sales among the industry, it is also difficult to standardize the market price. The high and low prices of tung oil over the years are listed below (in yuan):</p>
<p>as the standard (Note 3) With tip show as the standard.</p>
<p>The first market opened on the fifth day of the first lunar month is commonly known as the red market. The red market is bound by custom. The opening price must be high. This year, due to the thin inventory. It is said that there are less than a thousand pieces of red oil in the city. There are only seven or eight hundred dan of white oil. Therefore, the opening price of the red market is even higher, compared with the closing price at the end of last year. All increased by two or three yuan. However, it is doubtful whether Nengwu can sell at the opening price. The red market price this year is listed on the left.</p>
<p>(4) Traders in the Tung Oil Business</p>
<p>The tung oil industry in Shanghai has a long history. During the Daoguang period of the late Qing Dynasty, the Xin Zhuang Hu family founded the Hu Yuelai Tung Oil Company in Langjia Bridge outside the South City, which can be called the ancestor of the tung oil industry in Shanghai. Afterwards, the company was reorganized and renamed several times, but Hu Yuelai Tung Oil is still popular today. The old site of Hu Yuelai has now been renamed Yuelai Street. As for the current situation of the industry, according to its gang system, it can be divided into the Tin Gang and the Ning Gang, with the Tin Gang's power far exceeding the latter. Although the development of Shen Yuanlai, Yong Chengyuan, and Hengxiang No. 3 is later than that of the Green Gang, their turnover today can be said to be the leader of the industry. But in general, the industry is relatively stable due to its steady business management. The operators in Shanghai, except for Shen Yuanlai Yong Chengyuan, which is solely owned by the Shen family, Nanyuanlai and Beiyuanlai, which are solely owned by the Hu family, Hengxiangjin, which is solely owned by the Xu family, the rest are all partnerships, with capital ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 yuan.

<p>6. To Change Life, One Must First Establish a Revolutionary Outlook on Life</p>
<p>(Nanjing, Central News Agency, 11th) President Chiang gave a speech to all students at the Central Political School on February 10th. The following is a transcript of his original words:</p>
<p>Dear faculty, officers, and students, Today is the time when I, the Principal, give a speech to the school after the start of school this year. I remember that last year, it was also at the start of the spring semester that I gave a speech to all the faculty and students of this school, as well as senior generals. During this whole year, although the country's danger has increased, the country's progress has also been very rapid. As far as this school is concerned, today I see that whether it is the scale of the school, the achievements of education, or everyone's spirit and physique, it is very different from last year. There has been a lot of progress. From this, we can see that all aspects of our society and country are progressing day by day and year by year. This is something that I feel very gratified about in my heart. When school started last year, what I talked to you about was "The Basic Way of Learning and Doing Things." Because this speech is very important, and there are also some new students who have been admitted to this school who have not heard it in person, so today I want to briefly talk to you about the meaning of what I said last year again. Generally speaking, the most important meaning of what I said last year is that we, as a person in this scientific era, must understand the principles of science, develop the spirit of science, and use scientific methods in order to have great achievements in studying, doing things, and establishing achievements. It is especially the responsibility of our comrades in the military, political, educational, and various other positions, as well as the general students who will be doing things for the country. What everyone should do is the great cause of "governing the country and pacifying the world." Therefore, the reason why students come to this school to study is not to seek warmth and food for themselves, or to seek welfare for their families, but to create a bright and promising future for the country and the nation. At present, it is to put the responsibility of saving the country and the people entirely on our own shoulders and let us all take on it. Since the responsibility we bear is so important, if we do not pay special attention to studying the principles and methods of science, how can we shoulder this difficult and great cause and fulfill our responsibility of "governing the country and pacifying the world"? Not only can we not bear this responsibility of governing and pacifying, I am afraid that not even one thing can be done, and we cannot even become a modern person. Regarding the principles and methods of science, there are now very new books in China and abroad that elaborate on them in detail. However, everyone should know that the meaning and knowledge contained in the modern term "science" was not invented by foreigners, nor is it only known to foreigners. Our ancient Chinese people paid great attention to it as early as thousands of years ago. Not only were there many great inventions in the practical aspect, but also the most precise and extensive elaborations in the theoretical aspect. Among them, the most basic and essential book is The Great Learning. I often say that The Great Learning can be called "The Scientific University," which means that the content of The Great Learning is entirely about the principles and methods of science. It can be said that The Great Learning is the basic science and methodology. Whether we want to be a person or do things, we must thoroughly understand the principles of The Great Learning and practice them personally. Especially for our general comrades and students who bear the great responsibility of "governing the country and pacifying the world," we will educate the people in the future and achieve the effect of reforming the people and changing customs. We must govern the country and establish a career to carry on the past and open up the future. We must take "The Great Learning" as the fundamental learning. To put it in layman's terms, it is our "magic weapon" for success. If we want to aspire to a great career, if we do not have a "magic weapon" in hand, we will not have confidence in our hearts, and we will not have any ideas when things happen. In this way, not only can we not govern the country, but we cannot even govern ourselves and our families. Therefore, if we do not understand the basic methods of being a person and doing things, and we do not have a learning to settle our minds, no matter how good we study each subject of science and technology, it is useless, and in the end, it will not be successful. This is the first part of my explanation of the lofty greatness of The Great Learning from the perspective of science, and I want everyone to pay special attention to studying it. Secondly, from the perspective of philosophy, I also mentioned a general idea last year. Philosophy is a basic knowledge that everyone must have. People who do not understand philosophy do not understand what a person is, nor do they understand the purpose of life and the principles of being a person. They do not know how to be a person at all. Since they do not know how to be a person, no matter how knowledgeable they are, they cannot be applied. Therefore, students of our political school must pay attention to the cultivation of philosophy. There are countless books on philosophy in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Of course, we cannot study them one by one, but since we are Chinese, we must study and understand Chinese philosophy, especially The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean, which are the classics of Chinese orthodox ethics and political philosophy. We must study them carefully and thoroughly and practice them personally. The books on philosophy in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, are often biased towards idealism (spirit) or materialism (matter). In fact, spirit and matter are originally two sides of the same entity, different phenomena of the same thing, which are born from each other and need each other to be completed. In essence, they cannot be separated, and in theory, they cannot be overemphasized. Especially for all our learning, it is for life that we learn. If we are biased towards idealism, we will inevitably end up in emptiness and aimlessness. If we are biased towards materialism, we will inevitably destroy emotions and extinguish nature, and turn into coldness and dryness, which are all against the true meaning of life. Therefore, Chinese philosophy, especially the orthodox philosophy of ethics and politics in The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean, speaks of "investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, and rectifying the heart," and speaks of governing the country and pacifying the world, from "following nature" and "cultivating the Tao" to "heaven and earth in place and all things grow." It is the most noble, most perfect, and most correct philosophy that emphasizes both mind and matter, both the root and the branch, and elaborates on the subtle and the practical. Or some people think that what is said in The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean is biased towards the cultivation of the spirit, which seems to be an idealistic theory. In fact, it is not. The Great Learning begins with "investigating things" and The Doctrine of the Mean emphasizes "being in the middle," which means paying attention to the objective environment and all objective things. However, if we want to do things, succeed, and apply all things to reasonably adapt to and transform the environment, we must take the cultivation of the spirit as the foundation. Therefore, The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean pay special attention to the spirit. After explaining that spirit and matter cannot be separated and should be equally emphasized, Premier Sun said, "Since I am a 'person,' I should develop my spirit, which is also the reason why I can develop the spirit of 'person.' Therefore, revolution lies in the spirit, and the revolutionary spirit is the source of the revolutionary cause." This passage is completely consistent with the purpose of The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. Premier Sun also mentioned the passage in The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean that says, "investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world," which promotes a person from the inside to the outside, starting from the inside of a person and pushing it to pacifying the world. Such a precise and expansive theory has not been seen by any foreign philosopher, nor has it been said. This is the unique treasure in our knowledge of political philosophy. From this, it can be seen that Premier Sun's basic thought is completely rooted in Chinese orthodox ethics and political philosophy, that is, the consistent principles of The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. This principle is the basic knowledge that we must have for cultivating ourselves, governing others, and carrying out revolutionary nation-building. Therefore, I hope that all the faculty and students of this school, whether teachers are teaching or students are studying, must first pay attention to the way of The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean, and the legacy of Premier Sun, as well as the philosophy of people's livelihood mentioned by Mr. Dai Jitao in the theoretical foundation of Sun Wenism. We must first establish this fundamental foundation, and then all other knowledge can be applied for the country and the nation in a real way, and all revolutionary undertakings will have a successful foundation. Now there are not a few students who have graduated from universities at home and abroad, and there are also many who have real knowledge and skills, but why can't most of them use what they have learned and have a practical effect on saving the country? According to my observation, the root cause is that they have not paid attention to Chinese ethics and political philosophy, as well as the true principles of being a person and establishing a career. The students of our political school will all be created to be cadres for political construction and leadership in the future. If we also commit the same mistakes that many university students have committed in the past, only learning a little academic skill, only seeking food, clothing, wealth, and status for ourselves, and not learning the great way of being a person and establishing a career, and therefore what we have learned cannot be applied for the country and the nation, then we are not worthy of being students of the political school. Since we are students in a revolutionary political school, we must understand revolutionary political philosophy. Since we have entered the political university and become university students, we must study the way of The Great Learning carefully and we must strive to practice the way of The Great Learning. In addition to what I said last year, there are two important ideas that I want to share with you today. First, the purpose of education in this school is to cultivate revolutionary cadres. In addition to teaching students various necessary social sciences such as administration, law, diplomacy, finance, economics, education, land administration, statistics, and cooperation, we also teach military science and implement strict military management. Such a university that emphasizes both literary and military pursuits is unique in China. Therefore, the education of our school should establish a model of education that combines literary and military pursuits. This is something that all the faculty and students of this school should jointly recognize and strive for, and it is also very easy to do. Today, based on this idea, I would like to introduce another book to you, which is the Infantry Drill Regulations, especially the first article, the Infantry Drill Regulations Outline. If we say that The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean are the model of politics, we can also say that the Infantry Drill Regulations are the military university, especially the first article, the Outline, is equal to the first chapter of The Great Learning. Therefore, all military instructors must teach the essence of the Infantry Drill Regulations Outline to the general students when teaching military science. Students who want to study military science must first thoroughly study and understand this outline. Otherwise, all the military science that our instructors teach and the students learn will be completely useless, and if our general students cannot thoroughly understand the Infantry Drill Regulations Outline, it is like not understanding the first article of The Great Learning. No matter what, we cannot become revolutionary cadres with both literary and military talents. Everyone must know that the Infantry Drill Regulations Outline is not only about military affairs, but also about the spirit by which the entire military, politics, and society are promoted and by which all undertakings are completed. This spirit is the driving force of the military, politics, and society. We must thoroughly understand the content of the Infantry Drill Regulations Outline, and then we can recognize the common driving force of the military and politics, and then we can create revolutionary talents with both literary and military talents. Therefore, I am introducing this book today in particular, so that everyone will pay attention to studying it as much as The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Sets Up a Special Committee to Complete an Education Plan that Meets the Needs of the National Crisis</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) In order to plan the education programs of schools at all levels and meet the needs of the national crisis, the Ministry of Education has set up a special education committee, which has been approved by President Chiang. The organizational outline and the list of committee members will be appointed by the Ministry of Education in separate letters. At the same time, many academic experts will be hired as special committee members. The Ministry will first send letters to all committee members and special committee members, asking them to submit their opinions on the education program during the national crisis to the Ministry before February 15th. After gathering the opinions, a meeting will be held to discuss them, so as to complete the various tasks of the education program that meets the needs of the national crisis as soon as possible. All tasks are planned to be completed by the end of February in order to issue orders for implementation.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu: February Education Funds Expected to be Issued in Mid-Month; Payment Notice Already Signed</h3>
<p>When Jiangsu provincial schools and social education organizations were issuing January expenses, the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office borrowed 250,000 yuan from the bank to make up the difference. Recently, it was heard that the Education Fund Management Office has been working hard to collect education funds from various counties, with considerable success. On the 10th of this month, the Jiangsu Education Budget Review Committee held a meeting. As a result, payment notices for all February expenses to be issued to provincial middle schools, normal schools, social education organizations, vocational schools, rural normal schools, and provincial primary schools were signed. They will soon be sent to the Department of Education for stamping, and after undergoing auditing procedures by the Jiangsu Audit Office, they are expected to be issued to various schools and organizations around the middle of this month. It is also reported that after repaying the bank loan of 250,000 yuan from this year's Education Treasury funds, there will be more than 200,000 yuan left to cover one month's expenses for various schools and organizations.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang: Principals and Directors of Schools and Libraries in Various Counties and Cities Who Have Passed Training Shall Not Be Transferred Arbitrarily</h3>
<p>Principals of central primary schools and directors of public education centers in various counties and cities of Zhejiang Province who have passed concentrated training by the Department of Education shall not be transferred arbitrarily without special reasons approved by the Department. Previously, the Department issued a notice on the reward and punishment measures for trainees who passed or failed the concentrated training courses for principals of central primary schools and directors of public education centers in various counties and cities. Now, the Department of Education believes that the appointment and removal of principals and directors in various counties and cities have often not been handled in accordance with regulations, which not only violates the original intention of last year's training but also affects the progress of the work. Yesterday, it reissued a notice to various county and city governments, stating that in the future, all principals and directors who have passed concentrated training shall not be transferred without approval.</p>
<h3>World Chinese Students' Federation: Handling Procedures for Students Studying Abroad; Publishing the Start Dates of Academic Years at Universities in Europe, America, and Japan; Sincerely Welcome Inquiries for Assistance with Overseas Procedures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai World Chinese Students' Federation has a history of more than 20 years in providing study abroad services and hospitality. The Federation can handle all procedures for studying abroad, as well as other travel-related matters, upon request. It operates purely on a service basis and does not charge handling fees. For young students going abroad for the first time, the Federation's guidance is especially helpful as they may not be familiar with the various procedures. According to the Federation, the academic year starts at different times in different countries: mostly in October and early November for European schools, mid-September and early October for American schools, and early March (public schools) and early April (private schools) for Japanese schools. The time of departure depends on individual circumstances, but generally, July and August are suitable for Europe and America, and January and February are suitable for Japan. For those going to Japan to prepare and study language, August is also suitable. It is necessary to prepare early for procedures before departure, such as obtaining certificates from the Ministry of Education, foreign passports, and booking cabins. Students studying in the United States must first obtain permission from American universities before proceeding with other procedures. Because it takes time to process this certificate, it is essential to apply for it three to four months before departure. Those who aspire to study abroad and want to know all the details can directly contact the Federation for a complete answer.</p>

<h3>Swimming Team for the World Games: Guo Zhenheng, Chen Zhenxing, and Yang Xiuqiong Selected</h3>
<p>For the World Games to be held in Berlin, Germany, this year, China has decided to participate in five sports. Among them, the basketball team has already been selected, and 30 players have been preselected for the football team. Regarding the selection of swimmers, the Sports Association has selected two men and one woman. The men selected are:</p>
<p>Guo Zhenheng: Guo performed swimming skills at the Melbourne Centenary Memorial Meeting in Australia two years ago, winning the 100-yard breaststroke championship with a record of 72 seconds. He also won the breaststroke championship at the Sixth National Games. His selection is well-deserved.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxing: Chen is a short-distance swimming champion in China. Last year, he completed the 50-yard freestyle in 25 seconds at the Hong Kong-Shanghai swimming competition. He also won a championship at the Sixth National Games. Chen is currently practicing hard in Hong Kong, aiming to create a new record at the World Games. As for the women's team, it was originally set at two, but the Sports Association has only selected:</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong: The other one is still under consideration. According to reporters' speculation, the Sports Association's scope of consideration probably does not go beyond the South China champions Liu Guizhen and Chen Yuqiong.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association: Zhenru Defeats Youyou: 47 to 37</h3>
<p>Youyou Defeats Guanghua… 38 to 24</p>
<p>Qunyi Defeats Huawei… 48 to 15</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held three games last night. In the B Division Group 1, Youyou easily defeated Guanghua. In the A Division Group B, Qunyi defeated Huawei with overwhelming force. In the A Division Group A, Zhenru and Youyou were evenly matched in the first half, with Youyou taking a one-point lead at 17 to 16. Zhenru intensified its efforts in the second half and won with a score of 47 to 37.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Remained Spirited Throughout; Youyou Lacked Stamina in the Later Stages</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the fierce battle, the back-and-forth movements and offense and defense were all excellent, making it difficult to score for as long as four minutes. After Xu Wenkui scored first, Han Zhenyuan continued to contribute. Tong Yuchun did not lag behind, and Kuang Yao Ya was unwilling to fall behind, creating a tense situation. With Han Zhenyuan returning to the fray, one penalty and one shot, the situation was created. Later, the struggle between the two sides became even more intense, with the scores advancing alternately. First, it was 9 to 9, and then it was tied twice at 14 to 14. With Hui Pei and Wenkui providing support from both sides, Youyou took the lead again. Although Zhenyuan scored one, the first half ended with Youyou leading 17 to 16.</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the battle resumed. Youyou adjusted its lineup, but the Zhenru players were eager to turn the tide and made a concerted effort. Kuang's center scored four out of four shots, and Yan Lianjin added fuel to the fire. Wang Nanzhen and Cai Yanxiong also made contributions. The score soared twenty miles to thirty points. Only Xu Wenkui and Ma Cuimao scored two points in between. Afterwards, Youyou returned to its original lineup to fight back, and the situation slightly improved. However, the loss was too great, and the precarious situation could not be reversed. With the sound of the gong, the time was up, and Zhenru won with a score of 47 to 3.</p>
<p>Zhenru Foul Penalty Score Youyou Foul Penalty Score</p>

<h3>Qunyi Won All the Way; Qunyi Defeats Huawei</h3>
<p>The game between Qunyi and Huawei was quite competitive in the first ten minutes. Afterwards, although Qunyi's offense was still frequent, Huawei's defense was very diligent, so there were not many losses. The first half ended with a score of 7 to 16. In the second half, Huawei's military situation relaxed, lacking the previous meticulousness. The three forwards of Hua, Lu, and Tao repeatedly probed the basket, and although there were counterattacks, they were always outweighed by the losses. As a result, Qunyi won with a score of 48 to 15.</p>

<h3>Children's Educational Novel (175)</h3>
<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I don't want to see him, seeing him would only make him uncomfortable again; tell Donn to leave Tanteito to his care. I believe you older children will manage yourselves today. Fulang will give you instructions, and Reis will be here to take care of everything. So, we'll see you tonight."</p>
<p>As Mr. Pei was rushing out again, Amy stopped him and said, "Tell us something about Uncle John."</p>
<p>"He was only sick for a few hours. He died as he lived, happily and quietly, so we dare not express intense grief, lest we spoil the beauty of his last moment. When we arrived, we could still be with him; his arms were holding little Joe and little May, and he fell asleep in Aunt Meg's arms. There is nothing more, how can I bear it?" After Mr. Pei said this, he hurried away, stooped over, as if overwhelmed by his grief, because with the death of John Brooke, he had not only lost a good brother-in-law, but also a good friend, and no one could replace him.</p>
<p>The house was quiet all day; the little children stayed in the nursery playing quietly; others felt as if a Sunday had come again in the middle of the week, and they had to find ways to pass it, either strolling, or sitting in the shade of willows looking out, or playing with their beloved animals, but everyone often talked about "Uncle John," feeling that something kind, honest, and strong had left their little world, leaving only a feeling of loss that deepened with each passing hour. As dusk approached, Mr. and Mrs. Pei returned alone, because little Joe and little May were now the best consolation for their mother and could not be separated from her. Poor Mrs. Shu looked extremely tired and clearly needed the same consolation, because as she walked down the stairs, her first words were: "Where is my little Doubao?"</p>

<h3>Everyone Can Save China</h3>
<p>—Yiyiguan Zhuren (Master of the Yiyi Pavilion)</p>
<p>The fear is not "that they are unable, but that they are unwilling."</p>
<p>Speaking of "saving the country," the responsibility is indeed so great. If one does not have profound knowledge or real talent, how easy is it to save the country?</p>
<p>However, it should be known that a nation is like a person. When a person is critically ill, if he can maintain his vitality on the one hand and take the right medicine on the other, he may be able to turn danger into safety and come back to life. Saving the country is the same. We must first understand the crux of the nation's crisis. Then, on the one hand, maintain its vitality, so that its vitality is no longer lost. On the other hand, prescribe the right medicine and replenish the qi and blood. How difficult is it to save the country?</p>
<p>The problem with our country today is "exhausted financial resources." It is like a person suffering from "anemia," which leads to a hundred diseases. Internal and external troubles are pressing each other. For now, we must quickly protect its vitality on the one hand and replenish its blood on the other. And the way to protect qi and replenish blood is none other than for everyone to earnestly use "national goods"!</p>
<p>We know that "using national goods" is absolutely free. There is no need for profound knowledge or real talent. As long as there is awareness, determination, and willingness to be serious, everyone can use "national goods" and everyone can "save the country with national goods." So I want to say: "Everyone can save China." However, the fear is: "not that they are unable, but that they are unwilling!"</p>
<h3>Supplementary Remarks on Visiting Vegetable Oil Lamps</h3>
<p>The Chinese Oil Lamp Company created vegetable oil lamps and received unanimous praise from all walks of life. Many people have published positive reviews, which shows that they share the same feeling of stopping leaks and recovering rights. Now, reading Mr. Qiao Yunxuan's report on visiting vegetable oil lamps in the last issue of this journal, he expressed satisfaction with the style and brightness of the oil lamps, and gave instructions on various points, so that we can know how to improve them. It is very fortunate to receive guidance on such a small thing as a lamp. Our country's kerosene imports exceed tens of millions of yuan every year, and every family's lights depend on them. We have been born under the light of imperialism for more than a day, and our essence has been almost completely absorbed. Now, Zhong Lingjun invented the Chinese oil lamp, using agricultural vegetable oil, which is like lighting the lights with the sweat and blood of our own people, relying on our own efforts to regenerate, and nothing is more so than this. Currently, our company is manufacturing and selling them. Due to urgent demand from all parties, we are first producing wall lamps and table lamps. Other hanging lamps and glass lamps are being rushed to production. Regarding the price shown by Mr. Qiao, we will definitely strive for low prices, ranging from two cents to about one yuan in the future, depending on the user's economic ability. There are also lamps with three-cent wicks, which can save fuel, and we have prepared various simple diagrams and written instructions to be included with the lamps. Other points have been notified to the Shanghai manager of Yifeng Enamel Factory. If you want to visit the new lamp samples, please go to the Chinese Oil Lamp Company at 218 Shandong Road.

<h3>Domestic Goods Communication (1)</h3>
<p>— Bao Yi</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Renzhi recently traveled to Western Sichuan, going up the river from Wuhan, then Yichang, Shashi, Wanxian, and finally Chongqing and Chengdu, undertaking a grand tour with on-the-spot investigations along the way. Before his departure, the National United Movement for Domestic Goods specifically entrusted Mr. Huang to communicate the situation of promoting domestic goods as he traveled and made contact. This is the first communication from Mr. Huang on the situation after making contact in Wuhan: (Editor)</p>
<p>Yan Pei and Mr. Jiang Wenyu arrived in Hankou on February 2nd. That evening, the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Hankou Municipal Government, the provincial and municipal party departments, and the Pinghan Railway party department, six organizations in total, held a public banquet for members of the Chinese Education Association, creating a grand scene. During the banquet, Director He Chengjun of the Pacification Office gave a welcome speech, and Yan Pei gave a response on behalf of the Education Association. Both the host and the guests mentioned the severity of the national crisis and the reasons for the sluggishness of the national economy. Yan Pei then took the opportunity to report on the organization and purpose of the Shanghai United Movement for Domestic Goods, stating that representatives would be sent to Wuhan soon to jointly promote it, and especially emphasized the use of domestic goods in households, hoping that all the gentlemen and ladies present would vigorously advocate for it, which received great applause, as there were many ladies present.</p>
<p>Principal Zhou Shiwan of the Hubei Provincial Women's Normal School mentioned that there is a Hubei Provincial Domestic Goods Usage Committee in Wuhan, with representatives from various administrative agencies and social organizations participating, located in the Provincial Public Education Center. In addition, there is the New Life Women's Labor Service Corps, in which the Provincial Chairman's wife also participates, which greatly emphasizes promoting domestic goods. The Provincial Women's Domestic Goods Usage Committee is the general organization for women to promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>On the 6th, Mr. Zhou Zhongxuan, the owner of the Zhou Hengshun Machine Factory in Hanyang, hosted Yan Pei and Mr. Jiang at the Hankou YMCA, with more than 30 people present, mostly leaders from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors. Yan Pei and Mr. Jiang successively reported on the recent situation of the China Vocational Education Society. Yan Pei spoke about the relationship between vocational education and the social economy, and then reported on the general statistics of foreign trade in 1935 and the necessity of promoting domestic goods. He mentioned that the Shanghai United Movement for Domestic Goods would delineate areas and jointly promote it with various regions. During the banquet, the gentlemen spoke one after another, such as Mr. Su Taiyu, chairman of Yuhua Yarn Factory and former chairman of the Hubei Chamber of Commerce Federation; Mr. Zhou Wenxuan, chairman of the Hanyang Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Yang Wenquan, director of the stamp tax bureau; Mr. Hu Qingsheng, manager of the Shanghai Bank; Mr. Wang Shucheng, chairman of the National Private Power Industry Federation and director of the Water and Electricity Company; Mr. Zhou Weibai, engineer of Hengshun Machine Factory; Mr. Zhou Xingcun, director of academic affairs of the Provincial Vocational School of Engineering, etc., all gave speeches. Former Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Zhou Yunxuan; President of Huazhong University, Mr. Chen Shucheng; former Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Chen Jingyu; and Director of the Wuchang Machine Factory, Mr. Lu Ningsheng, also attended. Some advocated that the government and the people must cooperate to promote domestic goods, some advocated improving the manufacturing of domestic goods and studying the needs of various regions, and some advocated that social leaders should take the lead, so that the general public would know that using domestic goods is an honor. Ms. Liang, the young wife of Mr. Zhou, whose family is from Hunan, mentioned that Chairman He Jian of Hunan Province uses domestic goods in everything from government offices to households, advocating for it in society. Mr. X's remarks were particularly insightful, stating that to promote domestic goods, the government must use the entire national strength as a backing, just like Soviet Russia. Society must be like Japan, not using foreign goods even when abroad, let alone domestically. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic, and many ladies present expressed that when the ladies from Shanghai who advocate using domestic goods arrive in Wuhan, they will work together to promote and advocate for it. Therefore, the Shanghai women's community should quickly form a women's domestic goods usage group.</p>
<p>Slogans promoting domestic goods can be seen everywhere in Wuhan, and there are also large-scale domestic goods stores, hoping that Shanghai domestic goods will be transported there for promotion and sales. (From Hankou)</p>

<h3>Domestic Goods Promotion Team</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Diexian is a senior figure in the domestic goods industry, admired both domestically and internationally for his writings and economics. Even in his sixties, he continues to work hard for the domestic goods cause. In his spare time, he also writes for the "Machine Federation Journal" of the Shanghai Machine Federation. His writings are not empty talk, nor do they sing high-sounding tunes. They are entirely about guiding young people on the path to benefit, which we all admire him for. Recently, at the Machine Federation Congress, he proposed a motion to organize a domestic goods promotion team, advocating that the Machine Federation serve as the center for factories and promoters. Mr. Chen said: Since the Machine Federation is dedicated to thinking for readers and seeking to alleviate the panic of unemployment, the domestic goods promotion team I propose is to allow vendors to sell products from any factory, paying a certain deposit for sales, which is beneficial to both parties. However, any factory is used to wholesale in large quantities, and the clerks often find such matters trivial and ignore them. Sometimes introductions and contacts often go unattended. If the Machine Federation organizes it, it will surely develop successfully. Mr. Chen personally explained various methods in a lively manner, winning applause from two or three hundred people, indicating that the domestic goods promotion team is born out of necessity and is urgently needed. Therefore, the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center also organized a domestic goods promotion team last winter, collecting domestic goods from various factories and vigorously promoting them in various bustling cities, villages, and even households. Currently, there are fifteen or sixteen members, which has been well-received by various parties. The most diligent promoters can have more than ten or even twenty yuan of business per day. Since February, they have sold more than two thousand yuan of domestic goods for various factories, and the intangible publicity is not included. Now it is developing day by day, and it is planning to expand further and focus on persuasion and promotion. It is also known that Mr. Shen Jiucheng is willing to donate the preparatory expenses for opening a group of five people. He is worthy of respect and love. Mr. Diexian's proposal originated ten years ago, showing that it is based on his business experience and work insights, and is not comparable to ordinary ideas. It is best for the two organizations—the Vocational Guidance Center and the Machine Federation—to first consult on a division of labor and cooperation method, so that the promotion of domestic goods can be expanded day by day, and the domestic goods industry can have a continuous growth trend. At the same time, three aspects must be noted: the selection of character, the inspection of goods, and the research of promotion. What is essential is to investigate and seize opportunities. If this can be done, I think the domestic goods industry may have the hope of "extreme sorrow turning to joy" and "resurrection from the dead"?</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Market Situation – Approached the 50 Yuan Mark, but Ultimately Rose Slightly by Three Corners</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw large-scale contraction, rising raw gold prices, and a relatively firm opening, but failed to break through the 50 yuan mark. Major players took advantage of the high prices to sell off, the equalization tax showed little activity, banks initially hesitated, but then gradually leveled off. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London contracting and the US remaining flat, with both Montagu and Rothschild silver prices falling by four and a half points, leading to a uniform decline in exchange rates. London raw gold rose by two pence. The central bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the US and UK remaining flat, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold market price was listed at 1143 yuan and 90 cents, and off-market preparatory trading opened, rising to 48.9 yuan. Da Decheng sold off, retreating to 7 yuan. Ri Chang and others came in to buy. The morning opened slightly higher, with slight fluctuations after opening. Later, the buying side took advantage of the low prices to become active, banks came to bid for shillings, and sentiment turned firm and gradually rose, approaching the 50 yuan mark. However, major players took advantage of the high prices to supply, and the rising momentum was blocked, gradually falling back. HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with both the US and UK remaining flat. At this time, banks had mutual deals, and the situation fluctuated. The silver equalization tax was announced to have fallen by one cent, although slightly weak, the major players slightly covered short positions, so it was easily pulled up. Later, banks showed some hesitation, and the multilateral forces settled, and the trend gradually weakened, but there was also much support after the low, finally presenting a struggling situation. At noon, it was still fluctuating around 48 yuan, and the future was quite mediocre. Now the market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1147 yuan and 60 cents, equal to the previous closing. Ri Chang, Hui Xiang, Da Decheng, etc. advanced to 8 yuan.

<p>Trading in the market was normal. In total, Li Feng, Yuan Chang Yong, Shun Mao Qing Fa, Yong Hui Xiang, Heng Yu Yi Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Shun Mao Zheng Chang Xiang, etc. were on the buying side. Xiang Feng, Da Decheng, Yuan Heng Tian Fa, Fu Yu Ri Chang, Da Fa Yong, Chun Yuan Yong Qian Yuan Yong, etc. were on the selling side. Ding Kang Yuan Mao Yong first went out and then came in. Qia Feng Yong Yi Cheng Ri Chang first advanced and then went out.</p>
<p>It was found that the market situation for half a day was stable. The morning opening was 1147 yuan and 60 cents, and the noon closing was 1147 yuan and 90 cents. The highest price was 1149 yuan and 80 cents, and the lowest price was 1147 yuan and 30 cents. There was only a 2.5 yuan fluctuation, and the result was a slight increase of 3 corners compared to the previous closing. The total number of transactions in half a day was 8757.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rate Decreased: Foreign Exchange Resulted in a Loose Pound and Tight Dollar</h3>
<p>The exchange market was extremely mediocre yesterday. Exchange rates decreased, resulting in a loose pound and tight dollar. In the early morning, foreign telegrams showed that London saw large declines in both near and far terms, falling 0.1875. The New York silver market was unchanged. The Montagu forward silver price fell by four and a half points. London raw gold rose by two pence. The pound against the dollar fell by one and a half points. The pound against the franc fell by nine pounds. The dollar against the pound fell by one and a half points. The dollar against the franc fell by one and one-eighth points. The central bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the US and UK remaining flat, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold market price was listed at 1143 yuan and 90 cents. The Chinese business psychology was stable. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of the pound at 1 shilling 2 pence 4375, and the dollar at 30 yuan 125, compared to the previous closing, with the pound flat and the dollar tight 0.0625. After opening, banks took advantage of the cheap shilling to settle, and the situation was peaceful. HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with both the US and UK remaining flat. At this time, banks had mutual deals, fluctuating in the market. When the silver equalization tax was announced to have fallen by one cent, banks had a selling appetite, but because Chinese businesses were still bidding, there were still no special changes in the process. Extending to the noon closing, the near-term selling price of the pound was 1 shilling 2 pence 4375 and a half penny, and the dollar was 30 yuan 125, compared to the previous closing, with the pound loose 0.03125 and the dollar tight 0.0625. The same was true for the forward term, which was indeed a downstream exchange rate. There was a slight hesitation in the daily transaction. Now the half-day transaction is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In the morning, the near-term selling price of the pound was 1 shilling 2 pence 4375. Da Ying bid spot 4375 and a half penny. Mitsui and Jiayou sold to Da Ying February 4375. Zhengjin sold to Citibank spot 4375 and a half penny. The noon closing selling price for both spot and February was 1 shilling 2 pence 4375 and a half penny, March 375 and 4375 pairing, April 3125 and 375 pairing, and May 25 and 3125 pairing. The purchase price was increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>In the morning, the near-term selling price of the dollar was 30 yuan 125. Citibank sold to Mccali March 30 yuan. 30 sold to Xinfeng May 29 yuan 75. Huabi sold March 30 yuan.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Sichuan Sales Suddenly Rise, Futures Yarn Gradually Enters a Better State</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, gradually entering a better state. This is because the yarn sales show a significant development trend. Sichuan merchants' buying appetite continues to be good, and the sentiment is becoming more firm. At the same time, Osaka Sanpin yarn is rising step by step, so the market state is more stable. However, the amount of yarn in Shanghai has increased by more than 10,000 bales, so the sellers' pressure is still strong.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Near Month Falls, Far Month Rises</p>
<p>The auction yarn market opened in the morning, and the near-month market atmosphere was still weak, falling 0.6-0.7 jiao to 0.2-0.3 jiao. However, after the second round of auction, it gradually rose back up. Because of the good raw cotton, the yarn market, which is closely related, was difficult to be tired alone. As a result, the near-month fell 0.2 to 0.4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far-month rose 0.1 jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month rose uniformly, and the market atmosphere became more enthusiastic. As the Osaka Sanpin yarn market advanced step by step, the buying atmosphere in the market rose again. By the time of the third closing, the longs spit out, and a slight pullback was seen. As a result, each month rose 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Gengfeng sold 3200 bales, Senkang 800 bales, Runkang 1050 bales, Xinhua 300 bales, Yu Da 750 bales, Xingchang 450 bales, Dachangcheng 550 bales, and Dafeng 600 bales.

<h3>Longs Prepare to Take Delivery: Auction Cotton Is Tight in Both Near and Far Months</h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to rise, because Tong Ji's intention to take delivery this month is holding firm to the end. The situation is still firm, and the far month is entering a better state. Market prices are solid, but overseas cotton markets are still mediocre.</p>
<p>Far Month Led by Near Month</p>
<p>The auction cotton market opened in the morning, and each month fell slightly by 0.5 jiao, because although US cotton spot rose by five points, the forward fell by ten points, and Indian cotton fell even more, falling 1 rupee to 2.75 rupees. After the second round of auction, the near-month trend suddenly became tight, and the buying atmosphere was strong. As the longs prepared to take delivery, it jumped up by three corners. The far month was excited to rise. As a result, each month rose from 0.5 fen to 0.25 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The rising trend was even stronger when the market opened in the afternoon. As the Osaka Sanlu cotton market rose round by round, the sentiment became more expensive. As a result, each month rose by 0.1 and 0.2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Hengyi sold 1000 dan, Gengfeng 9000 dan, Runkang 3000 dan, Dachang 2100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1100 dan, Changhe 3600 dan, Meiji 1200 dan, Hexing 1300 dan, and Yichang 4400 dan.

<h3>US, UK, and Indian Cotton Report Declines: Sanpin Yarn and Cotton See Only Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, because the news from Liverpool was not good, retail longs closed, southern sellers hedged, and there were some who sold the excess amount due to fear that the Penk Hai case would be canceled. Each month fell by 0.5 to 0.9 points. The March period was uniquely firm due to limit-price buying. After that, the market situation was uneven. The far month was delayed due to the farmland case, and some people sold. The Director of the Cotton Office, Johnston, selling loan cotton plan, was able to attract attention. Soon, the Smith plan was delayed until tomorrow's discussion, and a wait-and-see trend entered. The closing was stable, with spot rising by 5 points, March rising by 4 points, and the remaining months falling by 4 to 12 points. UK spot cotton fell by 2 points, and futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton speculators bought in, which was offset by the sale of a small number of European exporters. Later, it softened due to long closing. The Pingguo fell 1 rupee, Omrao fell 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 2.75 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (11th telegram).</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 12th was 194 rupees, which was 1 rupee lower than the previous day's closing.</p>

<h3>Food: Tianjin Merchants Suddenly Handle Flour, Over 100,000 Bags Were Handled In Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw continued zeroing out of sales in Southeast Asia. Northern sales had been blocked for a long time and had not been activated. Therefore, after the auction flour market opened in the morning, it continued to fall by two, three, and four points due to the previous day's tired momentum. Although the market price returning was a small act of sentiment, yesterday the factory account hedging was also healthy. A total of 200,000 to 300,000 bales were hedged out in the morning and afternoon, and with the closing of the floating multiples, the market atmosphere was very depressed. However, in the afternoon, Tianjin merchants suddenly took advantage of the small price to handle it smoothly. A single merchant handled more than 100,000 bags, and the market sentiment was boosted, which also aroused the closing of floating accounts and scattered short positions. However, the far month was still pressured by the factory's throwing and remained small.</p>
<h3>Sudden Rally After the Decline in Standard Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw a rebound in foreign markets with American wheat improving by a dime or two. However, Liverpool and Australia continued to decline. There were also offers of foreign wheat in the market, although deals were difficult to finalize. Market sentiment turned soft again, and coupled with the sluggish market atmosphere in recent days, standard wheat immediately rebounded by five to seven or eight cents at the opening. By noon, there were inquiries from inland manufacturers and mills, and the flour market was also buoyed by sales to the north. Consequently, the standard wheat market showed a rebound. In the afternoon, speculative buying competed to absorb supplies, leading to a stronger upward trend. The closing price was even higher than the previous day. Current wheat was slightly affected by the standard flour wheat in recent days, declining by two cents yesterday. High-quality wheat opened at $5.25, with factories purchasing 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Coarse Rice and Hsien Rice Still Showing Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Hsien rice saw a shift towards weakness in the upstream Yangtze River area. Less than 1,000 bags of Crystal rice arrived at the port yesterday, and the quoted prices in Wenzhou and Taizhou also decreased slightly and became scarce. Although sales were steady, the market was stable, and the needs of this street remained unslackened. Yesterday, the Hsien rice market remained stable, with only coarse rice showing weakness due to sluggish demand. Throughout the day, 1,700 bags of Jiangxi rice, 600 bags of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice, and 665 bags of Sha and Han rice were sold, all purchased by this street. Tianjin merchants recently have a need for foreign rice, but it has been hindered by frozen waterways and has not yet been inquired about.</p>
<h3>Thick Japonica and Thin Indica Prices Hard to Stabilize</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various regions were close to fifty vessels, carrying approximately 10,000 shi (石, a unit of dry volume). Sales in this street remain sluggish, with only Yantai merchants purchasing about 2,000 bags. Therefore, market conditions continue to be weak. The price of thick early Japonica rice fell slightly by one dime, and thin Indica rice fell by eight cents. Sheyang pointed rice fell by five cents. Except for the currency exchange, there were no significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were twenty-four or five vessels from various routes downstream the river. The sales of various types of rice in the market were lackluster. The sales of white Japonica rice in stores were mediocre, and prices were barely stable. Medium and lower grades were weak, falling by nearly one dime. Early Indica rice followed suit, falling by nearly one chih (尺, a unit of length). Sales of thin Indica rice were sluggish, and retail sales were thin. Prices were weak, falling by about one dime. Although the arrival of Yang Hsien rice was not strong, sales were sluggish and lacked vigor. Apart from a slight decrease of one dime in market conditions, transactions of guest pointed rice were stagnant and weak, and the trend was also soft. Retail sales of white Yuan rice continued to be strong, and prices were tight by several cents. The prices of other goods were weaker than before.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Cake Shows Slight Rebound, Current Soybean Sales Also Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for standard soybean oil cake saw considerable fluctuations. In the morning, it continued the weakness of the previous day, and short covering was very active. Generally, there was great concern that Dalian market prices would continue to fall, resulting in a weak situation. The price of standard oil once fell by three or four dimes, and soybean cake by four or five cents. However, in the afternoon, news came from Dalian that although oil and soybeans have continued to fall recently (current soybeans fell by eighteen cents, oil fell by thirty-five to forty cents), long-term soybeans have rebounded, and Japanese merchants in Dalian are planning to export soybeans and oil to Germany and inland areas. As a result, market sentiment has improved, and short covering has become active. Therefore, the closing price of soybean cake for near-term delivery has rebounded by five cents, and the price of standard oil has rebounded by ten to thirty cents. The price of standard cake has also risen slightly. Although sales of current soybeans from factories are sluggish, sales in Fujian and Xiamen are still active.</p>
<p>Regarding the current spot market for yellow soybeans, because Shantou and Xiamen continue to take deliveries of soybean cakes, a total of 32,000 pieces of Class Four and Class Three futures soybean cakes from various factories were sold the previous evening. Yesterday, another 5,000 pieces of Class Four soybean cakes for delivery by the end of February were finalized, with 2,000 pieces for current delivery, 1,000 pieces of Class Three for current delivery, and 3,000 pieces for delivery before March 15. Therefore, the soybean demand from factories has become active, with over 2,000 bags of Luohe soybeans, over 1,000 bags of Zhumadian soybeans, and 500 bags of Xinyangzhou soybeans being traded. Although the prices have continued to fall compared to before, market sentiment is still good, and there are hopes for stabilization. Sales of other Zhazhou, Duzhou, and Shahuang soybeans are still not very strong, with a total of only over 1,000 bags being traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Loosens, Premium Qing Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to sluggish actual sales. The prices set by the association were $22.60 for spot coarse white Dutch sugar, down by five cents, and the same reduction for transit goods, at $7.55. The price of Dong Chi Bai Yuan (東赤白元) fluctuated little. The price of N-mark spot goods was once quoted at $22.15. The price of Zhenji No. 1 cotton white sugar from this factory remained at $21.40. Only a few dozen bags of Premium Qing sugar from Jianbang were offered, priced at $9.90, up by two dimes. The asking prices for Chao Qing numbers were higher, with high grade Premium Qing at $11.50, Huanggang Qing at $11.00, and Longgang Qing at $10.00. However, due to cautious observation by merchants, no transactions were made.</p>
<p>The Sugar Cooperative Company held its auction yesterday, but the transactions were still rare. A total of 1,618 bags of Five Rams coarse white sugar were offered at $22.60, with only 390 bags sold. 1,400 bags of No. 2 cotton white sugar were offered at $21.40, but none were sold. Over 700 bags of No. 4 cotton white sugar were offered at $21.20, with only 10 bags sold, down by five cents compared to Monday.</p>
<h3>Metals: Strip Iron Supply Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>Recently, a certain cigarette company has purchased large quantities of six-and-a-half-inch and eighteen-and-a-half-inch strip tinplate, resulting in almost all the spot goods in the market being snapped up. Standard prices have soared, with the price per bundle rising to $21, a huge increase of one dollar compared to before. Hot water bottle factories and can manufacturers are also competing to buy, resulting in increasingly scarce circulating goods. Therefore, the market trend is unusually strong, and the future market situation is likely to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of the Financial Sector in the Midst of Economic Panic (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dihua</p>
<p>Some believe that although China has a large trade deficit, invisible income is a way to balance international lending and borrowing. The so-called invisible income includes remittances from overseas Chinese, international investments, and expenses for foreign tourists and military personnel in China. Other countries rely on other forms of invisible income, such as business interest, insurance, and transportation fees, but China lacks such important items. For example, some estimate remittances from overseas Chinese to be 150 million yuan per year, while others estimate 200 million yuan or even 400 million yuan per year (estimate by G. E. in 1931). Secondly, foreign investment in China is estimated to be 100 million yuan per year. Combined with other income, the trade deficit and other international lending and borrowing may be in better shape. Regardless of the accuracy of the above estimates, the annual reduction of overseas Chinese remittances and economic downturn is a fact. There is also no certainty in offsetting the trade deficit. Observing the outflow of gold and silver in China's 1933 international balance of payments can also imagine the crisis of international lending and borrowing. It is not optimistic to offset with invisible income.</p>
<p>Since the trade deficit problem is so serious, the national economy will not be stable until the trade deficit is resolved, and China's economic panic will become more severe. We believe that increasing production is the only way to reverse the decline in the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Please look at the trade statistics to observe the imports and exports of agricultural products through China's wheat and soybean production statistics.</p>
<p>In the past few decades, a comparison of the nature of China's import and export commodities shows that food, beverages, and tobacco account for the largest proportion of exports, followed by raw materials and semi-finished products, and manufactured goods are third. Manufactured goods account for the largest proportion of imports, followed by food, beverages, and tobacco, and raw materials and semi-finished products are third. There have been very few changes over the years. In recent years, with the fall of the Northeast, the main exports of soybeans and miscellaneous sugars have lost their source. In terms of exports, manufactured goods rank first, followed by raw materials and semi-finished products. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), manufactured goods accounted for 39%, raw materials and semi-finished products accounted for 32%, and food, beverages, and tobacco accounted for 28%. In the first half of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), exported raw materials and semi-finished products ranked first, accounting for 37%, manufactured goods ranked second, accounting for 32%, and food, beverages, and tobacco accounted for 29%. In terms of imports, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), manufactured goods accounted for 49%, raw materials and semi-finished products accounted for 26%, and food, beverages, and tobacco accounted for 21%. In the first half of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), manufactured goods accounted for 46%, food, beverages, and tobacco accounted for 28%, and raw materials and semi-finished products accounted for 21%. Also, from a comparison of import and export commodities, the largest exports were soybeans, raw silk, eggs and egg products, and cotton, with soybeans accounting for more than 10%. However, with the loss of the Northeast in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), soybean exports plummeted, and raw silk ranked first again. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), tea ranked first, followed by cotton yarn, eggs and egg products, and cotton and tung oil. In the first half of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), tung oil ranked first, accounting for 7.35%, followed by hides, egg products, tea, peanuts, and raw silk. Among imported commodities, cotton and rice have always accounted for the largest proportion, often ranking second, accounting for more than 11%, followed by hardware, wheat, cotton cloth, and sugar. In the first half of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), imported foreign rice was particularly high, accounting for 14%, followed by hardware, cotton, and wheat. Based on this comparison of the nature of commodities and the import and export situation of commodities, we can also get a glimpse of the true situation of China's foreign trade and the development of the domestic economy. We can get the following two impressions!</p>
<p>In the comparison of commodity nature classification, the large proportion of food and raw materials is a manifestation of China's agricultural product exports. Although manufactured goods have ranked first in the past two years, this is purely a special situation. Among the manufactured goods, hides in China can only be listed as raw materials and semi-finished products, which cannot be compared with the leather manufactured by foreign chemical industries. Other manufactured goods can only be sold in the Nanyang market and have no fixed basis. From the perspective of export commodities, statistics on soybeans, raw silk, tea, egg products, tung oil, peanuts, and cotton account for almost 70% of total exports. Therefore, although China is not an agricultural country, there is no doubt that the balance of international lending and borrowing is sought through the export of agricultural products. The development of agricultural product production is of great importance to the national economy. However, the situation of agricultural products is the opposite. Regardless of the gradual reduction of food products in trade over the past seventy years, which has been a long-term trend and a manifestation of the decline of agricultural products, even if we observe the important exports of grains, raw silk, tea, and abandoned products in recent years, they have also been extremely weak. According to the agricultural product export trade index of the Institute of Social and Economic Investigation, with 1930 as the base year, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), grains fell to 29.83, in November of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), it was 28.73, raw silk fell to 37.93, eggs and egg products fell to 68.48, soybeans fell to 3.52, cotton fell to 52.22, and the total index fell to 42.90. Excluding grains and soybeans, it also fell to 64.72. In other words, it has fallen by 50%, and these agricultural products are the lifeblood of China's national economy. This slump in the export of agricultural products fully demonstrates the decline in China's production in recent years.</p>
<p>The situation of the population and commodities can also reflect the profits and losses of China's national economy and the rise and fall of industries. The largest proportion of manufactured goods in imports has always been clear evidence of China's industrial depression, and the second-largest proportion of food, beverages, and tobacco is sufficient to indicate the decline of China's agricultural production. For example, the three most imported items of foreign rice, cotton, and wheat are all agricultural products that are the most abundant and uniquely endowed in China, but they rely so heavily on foreigners. The three staple foods of rice, wheat, and flour have gradually increased since the past years. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), the import of foreign rice was only more than 2 million dan (担, a unit of weight), and after ten years, it increased to 20 million dan or more than 10 million dan. The same is true for wheat flour. The main reason for the increase in food consumption in China has not been seen to increase. Why has the amount of food suddenly increased, and the import situation is also an unordered increase or decrease, and it is definitely not a fixed need in the country. The important reason must be attributed to the decline in domestic production.</p>
<p>There is factual evidence that the most important reason for China's trade deficit and the decline of the national economy is the decline in domestic production. Therefore, the current relief problem also lies in increasing production. The so-called increase in production means improving quality and defining grades on the one hand, and increasing output and promoting the market on the other hand. Domestically, it can offset the import of unnecessary imported goods, and abroad, it can expand the market for export commodities that have a position, otherwise countries will use China as a dumping ground, and imports will increase and exports will decrease in the future, and the trade deficit will become more serious. Although the implementation of the new currency policy may gradually improve export trade, the fundamental problem still lies in the soundness of its own production power, which is what the financial sector in China should work together on.</p>
<p>(2) Establish a Central Policy to Develop Industry</p>
<p>Since the relationship between the financial sector and the national economy is so close, the financial sector also bears a very important responsibility. If we want to reduce the long-term trade deficit and make up for the losses of international lending and borrowing, we must increase production, and to increase production, the financial sector must engage in support. Has the financial sector failed to fulfill its auxiliary responsibilities for domestic production projects? That's not right. In recent years, the financial sector with a long history has indeed been able to wash away the old habits of following the old ways and being depressed, and the newly established banks can also move into the right track and serve sincerely. For example, the maintenance of factory bonuses, the support of national goods businesses, the expansion of commercial loans, the establishment of rural loans, and commercial acceptance notes and small loans are all directly or indirectly promoting the success of production projects. According to the loan statistics of various banks, it can be seen that the financial industry has invested a huge amount in industrial investment.</p>
<p>(Calculated based on the balance sheets of various banks in the Financial Yearbook)</p>
<p>The above table shows that 119 banks have a capital of 228 million yuan, and the total amount of loans is 1.6115 billion yuan. There is no data analysis of the nature of the loans, but the 23rd annual business report of the Bank of China shows that in the 22nd year, loans to agricultural, industrial, and commercial direct production projects accounted for about 44%, and in the 23rd year, it accounted for 48%. Loans to indirect production such as transportation and public utilities accounted for 2% to 3%. Assuming that according to the proportion of the Bank of China, 48% of the loans are granted to agriculture, industry, and commerce, the amount can reach more than 729.98 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Review of "Life Bookstore's National General Bibliography"</h3>
<p>— Zeng Jianping</p>
<p>In China's poor publishing and reading circles, the difficulty of buying books and the difficulty of reading books have long been obvious. In this atmosphere, Life Bookstore has taken on the responsibility of compiling this "General Bibliography" containing more than 20,000 books. This meaningful work is worthy of our deep admiration.</p>
<p>However, compiling a bibliography is not an easy task, and compiling a national general bibliography is even more difficult. However, this difficult thing has now been successfully done by Mr. Pingxin, which has to make us even more admire. Because I admire and hope to buy some readable books, I finally roughly flipped through the "National General Bibliography," the great work of Life Bookstore. However, unfortunately, the national general bibliography, which I thought would be better than a certain catalog, only increased disappointment and aversion. The expectations that I had in the past have completely flown out of my brain.</p>
<p>The most disappointing thing for me in the "National General Bibliography" published by Life Bookstore is not the classification method and other issues, but the symbols and opinions attached by the compilers. Since Mr. Pingxin, the compiler of the bibliography, stands on the position of "hoping that all bloody authors and cultural figures in the country can unite on a fiery line to resist and repel all zombie-style cultural reversals and sweep away all kinds of despicable bandit-style cultural destruction movements..." to "introduce valuable foreign masterpieces;" to "choose the books that are worth reading;" to "support what we should support - progressive and brand-new culture;" then, in principle, he should take on the task of pulling with a "brand-new" objective attitude when editing and introducing general books. However, after reviewing the contents of the General Bibliography, we cannot help but sigh that the editor is overly prejudiced. The so-called "no matter the faction, but the content is solemn," in Mr. Pingxin's book, the author has not actually seen it concretely. Not only did I not see it concretely, but I also saw Mr. Pingxin's arbitrary punctuation, "selfishness" and self-use, and a lack of understanding of the nature of general special and specialized reading materials.</p>
<p>Why do I say that Mr. Pingxin is just "selfish" and uses arbitrary punctuation? We can see many evidences in his bibliography.</p>
<p>First, although he divides all kinds of books into three grades. Early easy-to-read elementary reading materials are marked with plum blossom symbols, the highest-level reading materials are marked with star symbols, and the intermediate reading materials are marked with hollow triangle symbols. In addition, it is further stipulated that a black dot should be marked in front of the world's masterpieces, and a black triangle should be marked on the books that are problematic. However, the standard of his book division content is not solemn and has no definite meaning at all. For example, he listed the "Outline of Capital" published by Xin Ken Bookstore as elementary reading material, and the Capital published by Qingyun Bookstore (both are written by Japanese scholar Yamakawa Hitoshi) is listed as advanced specialized reading material (page 77 of the book). The "Twelve Lectures of Marx" translated by Xin Shengming Sa is listed as a book with problematic and distorted content, while Li Quanshi's "Economics ABC" is compiled without discount. Is this attitude and position solemn and without a factional position? This is really a bit difficult to understand. Assuming that Takabatake Motoyuki's "Twelve Lectures of Marx" are somewhat distorted, then aren't Bukharin's "Historical Materialism" and Deborin's "Dialectical Materialism" wrong and undistorted? What is the standard for the so-called problematic content and the so-called high-level and elementary books? Perhaps only Mr. Pingxin's "selfishness" knows!</p>
<p>Second, many books are listed as exceptions by the editor and are not marked. The content of this unmarked content fully expresses the editor's ignorance and partisanship. For example, the editor did not add the pre-determined symbols to the works about the Kuomintang, the works about fascism, and the works about the general Chinese rural economy and the military situation of various countries. Are the above-mentioned books unreadable? Or are the above-mentioned books not divided into easy and difficult? The reason why the editor is unwilling to add any symbols is probably to imply to readers that they do not need to read them at all. Otherwise, why are other books on the same page marked with symbols, while the above-mentioned books are not marked?</p>
<p>Third, in Mr. Pingxin's "General Bibliography," we can not only see his partisanship, but also see his mediocrity and ignorance of learning. For example, for books on geological and mineral surveys, the editor did not even have a symbol. Is it difficult to distinguish the depth and height of books such as "Nanjing Longtan Geological Guide" and "Summary of China's Minerals"? Are these books also not solemn?</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Pingxin's "Life National General Bibliography" is based on the position of promoting his own books, disrupting the vision of the reading circles, and ignoring scientific reading materials. Starting from this position, does the "General Bibliography" still have its true accuracy? To talk about Mr. Taofen's essays, it is really too much waste of the printer's paper and the buyer's money. What can we talk about to move forward.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Bookstore Scenes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>(10) Manuscript Acquisition</p>
<p>Turning back, let's discuss the publishing situation of the new bookstores. The most important thing is manuscript acquisition.</p>
<p>The attitude of each bookstore toward manuscript acquisition varies. Generally speaking, in the early stages of the new book industry, most new bookstores accepted external manuscripts. Some, when starting or expanding, seemed to fear they wouldn't have enough manuscripts to print, accepting submissions indiscriminately. Hua Tong, Great East, Shen Zhou, and others had periods of mass manuscript acquisition. This led to the emergence of a large number of "writer class" individuals who lived by selling their writing. It is said that some even organized "trusts" for translating and writing books, where one person would translate ten pages of a book, submitting their work in two days. A certain famous "scholar" in Shanghai reportedly organized an academic society, recruiting unemployed writers to mass-produce translations for him. The question of whether the works of a certain triangular romance novelist were entirely written by him was also a topic of interesting discussion. Some writers were not only unafraid of not finding an outlet for their work, but bookstores even had to pay in advance. For example, Guo Moruo's manuscript fees were over ten yuan per thousand words, and Zhang Ziping also said that he wouldn't sell his manuscripts for less than seven yuan per thousand words. How magnificent! A large number of "heavenly books" then appeared. Many social science classics were translated in such a way that people who didn't understand the original found them even more difficult to understand than the original. For example, in terms of the Chinese text alone, which part of the One-Dimensional History or the Critique of Experience could be read through? But because bookstores at that time easily acquired manuscripts, a large selling-writing class emerged. Even today, many people ask each other: "Can you make a living solely by selling writing in Shanghai?" Let me tell you, friend, this is a relic of history.</p>
<p>This prosperous era didn't last long. Afterwards, although bookstores didn't acquire manuscripts as blindly as before, many still accepted external submissions. The most interesting questions for those selling their writing were: first, what kind of manuscripts does this bookstore welcome? Second, do I have acquaintances in that bookstore? They believed that solving these two problems guaranteed a 90% chance of manuscript acceptance. Because I myself had worked as a junior editor in a bookstore, I know that the actual situation isn't so simple. Regarding the first question, as we said before, because the bookstore owners' ideas differed, each bookstore had its own preferences in publishing. But this doesn't mean that if your book aligns with their preferences, it will be accepted upon submission. On the contrary, the more similar the book is, the more likely it is to be rejected. Isn't this strange? The reason is: for example, if a bookstore publishes more books for middle school students, the bookstore will already have a more detailed plan for publishing such books, and the owner must be skilled in this area. Your manuscript may not fit into their planned schedule or fill a perceived gap. It might conflict with manuscripts they have already received or commissioned, or it might clash with their ideas. The quality of your manuscript's content is a secondary concern. If you don't believe me, look at how many systematic books in various bookstores are written or translated by specially commissioned insiders, versus those submitted by outsiders.</p>
<p>The second question is even more foolish. It is said that only one of the largest publishers in China used to value "face" when accepting external manuscripts. Sometimes, the manuscript was completely useless, but if you had "connections," they would accept it. After acceptance, their junior editors would heavily revise the manuscript before publishing it, if it was truly terrible. They would pay the manuscript fee and shelve it. But since the January 28th Incident, this situation has become rare. Other smaller bookstores, except during that period of blind manuscript acquisition, would never accept your manuscript simply because you knew someone. Because the editors-in-chief of those small new bookstores who decide which manuscripts to accept are mostly shareholders closely related to the bookstore. Publishing a book costs at least several hundred yuan. If they don't believe your book can make money, would they sacrifice hundreds of yuan simply for the sake of "acquaintances"?</p>
<p>Apart from the booming period of the book industry, all bookstores thoroughly select manuscripts (mostly from a business perspective). There are mainly two approaches to accepting manuscripts: first, manuscripts that fit into their pre-determined plans; second, manuscripts by the bookstore owner themselves. Ordinary shareholders are still useless. However, to be fair, if your manuscript suits the bookstore's publishing policy and you have an acquaintance who introduces you, it is slightly better. The benefit is that they will at least consider it and give you a quicker response.</p>
<p>The above situation only applies to the period when the new book industry could still be maintained. As for today, when the new book industry is on the verge of collapse, this statement needs some modification. Look, apart from Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and a few others, who is still publishing new books? Even relatively successful new bookstores such as Kaiming, New Life, Life, and Liming still publish new books, but how does their quantity compare to before? In this situation, the selling-writing class naturally has no market and is bound to decline.</p>
<p>However, this blow mainly affects the so-called literati or writers who live by selling their writing. It doesn't significantly affect scholars who conduct research and have new discoveries and achievements. Why do I say this? It's obvious that in China, there is a clear distinction between the former and the latter, even though they both write manuscripts. Those writers who sell their writing don't necessarily do any research on what they write. They might not even fully understand what they're writing about. But for the sake of "selling," they have to copy some foreign articles from English or Japanese sources or piece together some statistical figures to create an article or book-like product. Most of the writers in China today are like this. Otherwise, why were there so few works with some effort and new discoveries (regardless of the correctness of the content) during the past few years when the publishing industry was quite lively, such as Liang's History of Pre-Qin Academic Thought and Hu's Outline of Chinese Philosophy? As for truly valuable academic monographs with new discoveries, because they are fundamentally small in number, their outlets are unlikely to be cut off because of this.</p>
<p>However, even the reduction in outlets for the manuscripts of that selling-writing class is naturally a sad phenomenon for the publishing industry from the publishing industry's perspective. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Writing and Publishing (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wu Lifu</p>
<p>However, we should re-evaluate the impressions we get from them. First, we are unwilling to admit that they are the best. We would rather think of them as second-rate or inferior material in a pharmacy. As for the top-tier stuff, it's not that it doesn't exist now, but the constraints make it impossible for writers to display it. Second, we believe that every piece of writing has its true face, which changes after publication: degradation, of course, is not enough to encompass the original spirit and attitude. Nowadays, in order to get published, works often shrink, are damaged, or weaken themselves. Readers should be able to imagine the whole of the writing and estimate the reduced value of that "top-tier stuff." Third, we must also remember that writing is meant to reap rewards. If it encounters obstacles, it must still move forward along a curved path, even if the reward is reduced, it's better than nothing. So, it may be okay to say that Gide's thought is a bit weak, but if it is completely eliminated, it would not be a loss to the intellectual class. If we want to criticize, we must first understand clearly that the responsibility sometimes lies with "publishing" rather than "writing."</p>
<p>In the end, if we put aside the conditions of publishing and blame writing, we are somewhat ignoring the practical difficulties. Moreover, the unfairness in this is just like Mr. Zhu's haphazard method and the reckless use of all the general terms such as "forward," "backward," etc.!</p>
<h3>How to Watch Movies? (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Mingyu</p>
<p>——Review of the Method of Film Appreciation</p>
<p>Commercial Press "Weekly Standard" Book No. 10</p>
<p>Translated by Bei Zhonggui (Price 8 jiao)</p>
<p>When you come out of the theater, even if you don't feel like you've wasted two hours, it's a fact that the foreign money has jumped out of your pocket in vain. This often happens. Money wasted, time lost, and you still have to suffer the pain of a dull, dry feeling. Who wants to seek entertainment and end up feeling bored?</p>
<p>Movies are a new and rapidly developing art. Now, movies have become the most popular form of entertainment for the masses around the world. This art form has a relatively weak class connotation and is close to all aspects of human life and society. It would be a pity not to have a reasonably correct understanding of it. The introduction of Film Appreciation (Edgar Dale: How to Appreciate Motion Pictures) to China cannot be denied as a meaningful endeavor.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this book is to tell you how to appreciate movies. It reveals the basic knowledge of film art to you, enhances your understanding of film entertainment, cultivates your ability to appreciate, and raises your standards for choosing films. Moreover, it also points out the true purpose and value of movies to you, and suggests a reform plan for future production.</p>
<p>The level of screen appreciation of Chinese movie audiences is generally very low. Most people watch movies only to understand the development of the story and watch the legendary and tortuous plot. This is low-level appreciation. People who truly understand the essence of movies and fully appreciate film art will not miss the director's techniques, the angle of the photography, the acting of the movements, and the matching of sounds, etc. These are the techniques used to express the content of the film. These techniques can depict the film story like a vivid dragon and tiger, making you feel the real sense of connection with its ups and downs! A film with a very ordinary subject matter, if the director's technique is superb, the camera lens is fresh, and the performance is sincere, it may not be condemned as vulgar. In truth, people who do not understand film technology can never fully understand the story on the screen and its deep and realistic quality.</p>
<p>In order to increase the ability to appreciate movies, even just to gain common sense, we need to have knowledge and understanding of movies. For example: how should acting be considered good? This standard must be measured by the role's suitability, satisfactory makeup, thorough understanding of the plot, skillful depiction of emotions, natural performance, consistent character, and the use of dialogue skills. This book provides detailed and concrete rules on how to use these scales, and also cites many examples from films to make it easy for readers to understand.</p>
<p>Secondly, it tells you more knowledge about photography. For example, the scene of a movie should use a certain description under certain circumstances. We can know that great long shots should be used for great distant views; medium shots should be used for ordinary positions; and close-ups should be used to remind the audience of what to pay attention to. Also, should the transition from one scene to another be "fade in" or "dissolve"? If you are not completely ignorant of the distribution of light and dark and the handling of angle size, then you can add a lot of information for appreciation when watching movies.</p>
<p>Also, the director is the life of a film. The director's poor performance will destroy the best script; will make excellent actors perform extremely poorly; will disrupt the rhythm of the whole play—simply can destroy all the conditions for good and beautiful entertainment. "The director is the key to a movie" is not wrong at all. But Chinese audiences don't pay attention to the director. They only know the stars on the screen, praising them blindly, not knowing that the authority that determines the life and death of the whole movie is in the hands of the director; and they don't understand that the acting of the stars' expressions is controlled by the director. Actors without flexible skills can be remedied by the director's methods. If the director lacks a clever mind, the fate of this film is decided no matter what. Every part of the film has been agreed to by the director. The ideal director is a combination of actor, artist, playwright, psychologist and technical photographer. But most Chinese audiences don't know what position the director occupies or what he does, so their understanding of movies and their appreciation of movies are always superficial, not getting to the core of the problem.</p>
<p>This book has a concise and pertinent discussion of the importance of the director. It also has a clear description of the function of the set, the use of music dialogue, and the source and quality of movie stories. In short, it dissects the process of making a film in front of you, so that you understand what a film is, and increases your ability and interest in appreciation. This is the first contribution of this book.</p>
<p>Second, it makes you choose the films you want to watch carefully and appropriately. Many people watch movies without any selection. "Ah, let's go to the movies!" Good or bad depends entirely on luck. Ordinary people rely entirely on advertisements, but can advertisements be trusted? According to the advertisements of movie theaters, none of them is not an unprecedented masterpiece, and none of them is not the highest and most superb masterpiece. You know how absurd this deception is. Only a very small number of people know how to use the movie reviews in newspapers. But movie reviews are not a reliable guide either. Its criticism is not necessarily correct, especially not your own opinion. You should have your own opinions and standards. Some people choose based on admired stars, but this often leads to disappointment. Choosing a movie is not a casual matter; if you go to see those inferior films once or twice, you are supporting its growth, which will eventually harm society. Therefore, precise selection of films not only prevents you from being fooled, but also can improve the standards of film production, that is to say, improve the level of social culture.</p>

<h3>Re-partitioning of Colonies</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>After the end of World War I and the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, diplomats from the major powers ran around telling everyone that militarists had been restrained, and that peace could be maintained forever without the occurrence of cruel wars. The politicians of these victorious countries (Britain, France, the United States, etc.), after sacrificing tens of millions of lives, naturally hoped that the world would be peaceful, since they had "achieved their goal." However, anyone with a little knowledge of the world had already concluded at that time that a second world war was inevitable. Because the existence of imperialism lies in supporting it through the supply of raw materials, the sale of commodities, and the investment of surplus capital in colonies. However, with the increasing advancement of production technology, few countries are satisfied with their existing colonies. Therefore, competing for colonies and fighting for colonies has become a characteristic of imperialism.</p>
<p>Look at the plight of the Black people in East Africa, and the suffering of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor in the Far East, which are realistic explanations. Apart from the fact that these two countries have already started to "freely acquire" colonies, the 卐 partisans who are reorganizing their military and preparing to restore the Third Reich are also openly clamoring there, eager to try. Hitler gave a speech to 卐 party college students on the 26th of last month, saying that European countries have the right to colonize overseas. Germany is now a very strong country, and does not need the aid of the League of Nations, nor does it need treaties or alliances. Colonies are acquired by power, and white people, with their heroic concepts of life, are destined to be the ruling class. This statement has almost completely revealed the intentions of the National Socialist Party after rearming. The above is just about the most prominent and important struggles for colonies at present. The conflicts between Britain and the United States on a global scale, the confrontation between Japan and the United States in the Far East, and the clashes between Britain and Italy in Africa all tell us that what the major powers want at present is not world peace, but the re-partitioning of world colonies!</p>
<h3>The Fate of Girls</h3>
<p>— Shidai</p>
<p>The father sat on the threshold of the aisle with a pipe in his mouth, his face wrinkled, his whole mind captured by thought. When he heard the baby crying in the house, he gently knocked off the ashes from his pipe and tucked the pipe into the waistband behind his back. He held his head with his cold hands, and suddenly stomped his left foot heavily. After a while, he unfolded the wrinkles on his forehead, and a kind of joy burst out from his heart. He remembered that Mr. Song Si had divined an "upper hexagram" for him, saying that he would definitely have a son this year. He immediately pricked up his ears to listen to the baby's crying, as if he wanted to distinguish at once whether it was the voice of a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>The midwife, Aunt Bingwu, walked out of the courtyard with a smile:</p>
<p>—Brother Lequan! Congratulations!</p>
<p>As soon as the father heard Aunt Bingwu's congratulations, his face was full of smiles, and he asked urgently:</p>
<p>—Is it a boy?</p>
<p>As soon as he said the words, he pricked up his ears, preparing to hear Aunt Bingwu's answer. Aunt Bingwu was silent for a long time before she laughed twice.</p>
<p>—It's a girl! Very fat, very fat!</p>
<p>It seemed like a glacier had fallen from the father's head. He stood there blankly, like a stone pillar. Aunt Bingwu walked away embarrassedly. On the street, she told Elder Fu Tian:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Lequan has another daughter. Brother Lequan is angry and stunned!"</p>
<p>The baby's crying aroused the father's anger. He stepped into the house and yelled, jumping up and down in unbearable anger:</p>
<p>"Another slut to raise!"</p>
<p>My sister and I quietly lay on the edge of the pit like two little lambs, watching our mother shed tears.</p>
<p>No matter how high the father jumped or how angry he scolded, the mother just wept, without answering a word. Before, she had told us that when she first married the father, she often suffered from the grandmother's anger. When she gave birth to my eldest sister Xianzi, the grandmother did not give her anything to eat for three days. The grandmother said, "A daughter-in-law who gives birth to a daughter is not a good thing! That is all karma created in the previous life that makes her give birth to a daughter in this life!"</p>
<p>"Do you want me to send this life to these sluts? Think about it, what good is it for you or for me to raise these money-losing goods when they grow up! I have to protect the few acres of land left by my ancestors, but you spendthrift, raising so many sluts, you're simply going to eat me clean!"</p>
<p>The mother cried out, and my sister and I were also frightened by the father's scolding and cried.</p>
<p>My little sister Meizi ran back from outside with a handful of scallions, shouting in the yard before entering the door:</p>
<p>"Sister! I have scallions!"</p>
<p>As soon as she crossed the threshold and saw her father getting angry, she was frightened into being docile and obedient, her two small eyes staring straight at her father's face.</p>
<p>"You little rabbit! You went to the garden to pull scallions again!" The father slapped Meizi to the ground, and she cried out for her mother!</p>
<p>"Poor thing! Can't be cured!" The father finally gasped, and walked out angrily and sadly.</p>
<p>The mother was buried in weeping. She did not give the baby milk to eat. She planned to never give the baby milk. She had to starve the little animal to death alive! That might alleviate her man's oppression of her! "Really! If we can't keep the property left by our ancestors, it's simply a sin! The souls of the ancestors can come to torment you! They'll send you to the mountain of knives after you die, and down to the eighteen levels of hell!" From birth until now, she was confident that she had never committed a sin. When her mother-in-law was alive, no matter how abused she was, she never resisted or struggled in the slightest. She was determined to achieve the point of being a "virtuous daughter-in-law." She would always be obedient to her own man.</p>
<p>The father did not eat dinner in the evening, his face was full of sorrow, and the pipe was never away from his mouth. Smoking was his only comfort. He had been squatting by the stove for half an hour, without saying a word. The mother climbed up from the pit with her weak postpartum body, and peeked from the alcove to the outer room to look at the father who was cast into distress. Her emotions could no longer be sustained, and her tears quickly dripped down. She used a hoarse voice to say:</p>
<p>"Don't I want a boy? That's our fate! It's destined!"</p>
<p>The father didn't say a word, as if he felt that the mother's words made sense? He tapped the pipe's metal tip on his shoe, his eyebrows almost squeezed together.</p>
<p>The baby opened her tender, blood-red little mouth and cried straight out. The mother hardened her heart and did not give her milk, but tears kept dripping from the mother's eyes onto the baby's face.</p>
<p>The room was filled with a depressing atmosphere. The kerosene lamp flickered with a faint light, as if it was also unhappy for its owner! Meizi fell asleep on the west side of the pit without even taking off her clothes, still holding a piece of cold sweet potato that she hadn't finished eating.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, the mother cried again. She sat up, and the father leaned against the window sill, smoking a pipe in his mouth, watching the light of the lamp in the alcove. The baby lay stiffly in front of the mother, dead! The poor little animal that had just been born was finally starved to death!</p>
<p>——Heavenly Father! Don't let me give birth to girls anymore! ——The mother looked at the father, then at the baby's body, and cried out in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The father's pipe bowl shone with a red light.</p>
<h3>Funerals</h3>
<p>— He Jin</p>
<p>When the note "Closed for funeral" was posted on the door of the Xiang Kang Sock Factory, it was like a rumor of war. All the Hakka and money houses in the city who had dealings with Xiang Kang were uneasy, fearing that the Xiang Kang Sock Factory would die along with its owner, Zhu Chongkang. At noon, the managers and foremen all came to the Xiang Kang Sock Factory by appointment. This was incomprehensible to Zhu Chongkang's family. The Xiang Kang Sock Factory had suffered disastrous business losses in the past two years. Although he had mortgaged everything, including the land, factory building, and equipment of the sock factory he had founded, the creditors often refused to let Zhu Chongkang keep any cash in hand when he occasionally made a small deal. When settling accounts last year, Zhu Chongkang hid in the darkest small building in the factory for almost half a month, afraid to meet anyone. He fell ill right at the beginning of the new year, didn't see a doctor, and within a week, Mr. Zhu, who had made his fortune in business, suddenly passed away, leaving behind countless debts. But as the family was discussing funeral expenses, so many guests came to pay their respects that Zhu Chongkang's son, with a mournful face, wanted to discuss this money with his father's friends.</p>
<p>Zhu Chongkang's body had already been moved to the main room, but there wasn't even enough change in the treasury to buy a pair of incense sticks and candles. On the one hand, the managers and foremen did indeed perfunctorily reassure the few gentlemen in the factory with compassionate words, but their eyes were probably estimating the market value of the entire factory. When Zhu Chongkang's son expressed the need for help with these final expenses, every creditor became fierce. If Zhu Chongkang's corpse could still speak, it would probably lead a whole team to storm into the main room.</p>
<p>The manager of the Xiang Kang Sock Factory was a distant nephew of Zhu Chongkang. For his uncle's business, he was the most dedicated person in the factory. When the Xiang Kang Factory was first established, there were seven or eight similar businesses in the city. Thanks to the manager's efforts and planning, the Xiang Kang Sock Factory gradually swallowed them up in an aggressive manner. Land was purchased in the south of the city to build factory buildings, and a water-heated sock ironing room was added. The spinning machines in the factory hummed day and night, and whole boxes of socks were shipped to the dock every day. However, the Shanghai War broke out, and the steamers stopped running. Hakka merchants would rather abandon their deposits than risk greater danger to ship goods, and entire batches of sock boxes piled up in the factory. The manager suggested stopping work immediately to see how things developed, because even if the Shanghai War stopped immediately, these stocks could meet the market demand. Xiang Kang had complete equipment, and working a few all-nighters could fulfill orders. But Zhu Chongkang refused to do so. His view was that the Shanghai War would end within a few days. Customers had already paid deposits for the factory's stock, and if new customers came, what would we use to meet their needs? However, the Shanghai War dragged on for several months. After the ceasefire, all kinds of businesses plummeted, and the entire factory's inventory could not be exchanged for a single silver dollar. The various money houses had overdrawn large sums. Of course, with Xiang Kang's situation, as long as business improved, there would be no problem. However, yarn sales were sluggish, and the market only got worse. In this situation, the uncle and nephew were ultimately unable to maintain the situation. Because of a rumor from the creditors that they would jointly sue, auction off the factory building, and liquidate debts, Zhu Chongkang lived for Xiang Kang and died for Xiang Kang.</p>
<p>Now the corpse is in the main room, and the creditors have already revealed that they will exercise their legal rights. The nephew, Manager, knew the situation well. He was worried that his uncle's body would not be prepared for burial. On the other hand, he was the manager, and he had to come up with a foolproof way to stabilize the creditors who filled the room. Finally, he took out the account books from previous years and declared bankruptcy. He sobbed as he announced to the crowd:</p>
<p>"My uncle is dead, and Xiang Kang has declared bankruptcy. Do with it as you please. I need to take care of the funeral..."</p>
<p>Without finishing his sentence, he put on his hat and left.</p>
<p>The room was left in a state of chaos like a market shouting prices:</p>
<h3>Goddess</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zuo</p>
<p>After a while, the thunder stopped, the lightning went out, and the selfish war ended like this. The tired sun retreated beyond the celestial sphere, the repaired celestial body was ultimately destroyed again, and the exiled darkness had all fled back. The bottom of Buzhou Mountain was piled up with the wreckage of selfishness. (Twenty-two)</p>
<p>On the 11th, the "Goddess" zinc plate was inverted. This is to correct it.</p>

<h3>Holy Land</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tian</p>
<p>G Mountain has already become the only holy land of S City.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, it was still a desolate mountain wilderness. Living on it were fishermen who drifted on the sea year after year. They built their homes in the forests and made their living on the beaches by the river. But since the prosperity of S City, everything of theirs was imperceptibly encroached upon, taken away, and sacrificed, including their ancestral property.</p>
<p>S City, on the coast of the Southern Country, is already a modern prosperous city today. However, the barren G Mountain has also prospered along with S City.</p>
<p>When a ship enters T Bay, a beautiful landscape will appear in the eyes of foreign travelers. In the middle is a vein of peach-colored river flowing. On the right bank is a vast plain. The modern buildings of S City seem to be continuous mountain peaks erected by the river. The customs clock tower reveals its greatness in indicating the time of mankind. Standing opposite on the left side of the river is another world, a green mountain peak, rugged and towering, kissing the clouds. White farmhouses emerge in the green color. The magnificent and dignified holy land is deposited in the embrace of that green mountain.</p>
<p>The magnificence and grandeur of the Patrie Church, for twenty years, has become a holy place worshiped by the residents of S City. When you approach its snow-white stone steps, looking up at the church on the summit, you will feel the insignificance of mankind and imagine how solemn and great the Lord is.</p>
<p>On G Mountain, in addition to the Patrie Church, there are also hospitals, monasteries, schools, cemeteries, and countless magnificent residences arranged in all directions of the forest. If a foreign tourist steps on the road on G Mountain, flanked by pine and cypress trees that are many years old, and observes the beautiful buildings in all directions, he will feel everywhere that this is the territory of Switzerland, a beautiful garden, and think that he has entered heaven.</p>
<p>The taste of Europeanization and the tranquility of sentiment, on the mountain road, will be revealed everywhere. When the sun sets, countless foreigners and our noble compatriots walk leisurely in the golden light, singing happily. On every Sabbath, it becomes an even more lively place. On the C of the pine forest, devout men and women are arranged in groups. Ah! Truly a great holy land.</p>
<p>The Lord is peaceful, loving, and pure, but mankind is fierce, vicious, and filthy. On this magnificent and majestic holy land, mankind has added countless stains to it.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, people used it as a tool of aggression, but twenty years later, it has become a weapon to seize profits and seek wealth. The barren mountain inherited from the grandfathers of the fishermen twenty years ago, the fishermen's happy hometown, although it has become the Lord's holy land, has become a modern beautiful garden. But it has created countless sins for mankind; the foolish are invaded and believe in it, while the wise use it to profit. Holy land, holy land, is just my cruel murder weapon.</p>

<p>Aunt Wang: Fifth Brother told me when he left to wait for your uncle to come back and then go to the boat to wait for them. Let's go together later.</p>
<p>A Qiao: When will Uncle be back?</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: He left long ago. He went to the county to inquire about the soldiers repairing the embankment.</p>
<p>A Qiao: Will the soldiers help the people repair the embankment? Didn't they collect donations from us for the defense corps?</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: I heard that in some places, the soldiers also help the people repair the embankment. It can't be generalized. But I haven't seen any soldiers helping with the repairs at the front village!</p>
<p>A Qiao: Then why did they collect our money? (Dog barks) Is someone coming?</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: Let me go out and take a look. (Opens the door, sound of rain, wind, dog barking)</p>
<p>A Qiao: Put on a coat before you go out. It's raining outside!</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: It's okay, don't come out! Who is it?</p>
<p>Crowd: Oh my God! Where can we escape to? It's so dark ahead! And there's water behind us!</p>
<p>Oh God! Let us die! It's harder to suffer alive!</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: (Closes the door) Little Qiao, it's terrible, more and more people are fleeing!</p>
<p>A Qiao: What do we do?</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: Your uncle still hasn't come back!</p>
<p>A Qiao: What did that old man run off to the county for?</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: He's the village head! He was entrusted by everyone to petition in the county!</p>
<p>A Qiao: That old man always likes to meddle in other people's business, that's why he became the village head of whatever county!</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: That's right, the village head isn't an official, and sometimes he even has to pay out of his own pocket, but he's quite happy to do it.</p>
<p>A Qiao: I'm not just talking nonsense. With the flood situation so dangerous, I'm afraid they ran away before we did, right?</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: Who can say for sure! (Wind and rain!)</p>

White clouds ten thousand miles, mountain pass moon. Blood green thousands of years, emperor's flower. There is moon without flowers, truly less interesting. There is flowers without moon, quiet without clamor. From now on. Flower morning moon evening, spend the years. Cheng Fangzhou Li Liansun Mao Jia Shu</p>

<h3>The Song of "Spring Flower"</h3>
<p>— Luo Gong</p>
<p>…Visiting Shooting Notes…</p>
<p>Two worlds are unfolding in this studio. One side is the lakeside of Spring Water, the fine willows gently blowing in the moonlight, and the light waves in the lake are quietly shimmering. The other world is a silver world, with white snow covering the entire wilderness, pressing on the dead trees, pressing on a small village house, embellishing this plain picture.</p>
<p>Director Wu Cun, and a team of musicians arrived one after another. Today's shoot is the "Spring Water Lakeside" scene, and Yan Yuexian wants to sing a beautiful song "Spring Flower" in this poetic environment.</p>
<p>One mercury lamp after another was completed, and beams of light intertwined with this beautiful scene. The waves in the lake rippled, the moon in the sky brightened, the willow branches gently swayed, watching Yan Yuexian sing the song of spring, she was so happy, listening to the intoxicating singing, the lyrics were:</p>
<p>"East wind blows spring overnight", the oriole heralds at dawn, listen to the spring welcome tune.</p>
<p>"Originally, who could bear the frost and cold, fortunately, the spring light has arrived, managing people's laughter".</p>
<p>"Flower color charming, flower appearance pretty, gentle wind and drizzle it shadow shake, people inside the fence look at the flowers outside the curtain, the flowers outside the curtain reflect like flower appearance."</p>
<p>"Flower branch bending, flower rhyme wonderful, powder butterflies and singing birds laugh before the flowers, before knowing spring color will撩 people, partial love spring flowers children laugh."</p>
<p>(White: "Time runs so fast! Look, the tea sprouts have opened, the spring light is old, and all the flowers have withered. How can I eliminate my full of spring mood and spring sorrow? Tell me! Tell me!")</p>
<p>"Before sending off spring, spring has left! Sunflower no plan add trouble, spring hate really difficult to eliminate!"</p>
<p>"Ruthless thoughts, partial to disturb, haggard falling flowers drifting with the water, how to spend spring dispel?"</p>
<p>Another person from the singing world on the screen</p>
<p>Will meet you in "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance"</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun Dressed as a Man Visits Ancestors</h3>
<p>— Han Lan Gen's Face Covered in Chicken Droppings —</p>
<p>Jiang Xiu, a wealthy overseas Chinese in Nanyang, although possessing millions of assets, has only one daughter under his knees, so he regrets not having a son all his life. However, this daughter, Yuan Meiyun, is born innocent, clever, and considerate, so Jiang Xiu loves her like the pearl in his palm, treating her as a son.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiu's father, Wang Guilin, lives in the motherland. Because he is old and eager for a grandson, he wrote a letter urging Jiang Xiu to bring his grandson back. Because in his old man's mind, Yuan Meiyun is a boy. The reason is that eighteen years ago, when Yuan Meiyun was born, Jiang Xiu, in order to comfort his old man, reported that the baby was a boy. Jiang Xiu originally thought that in the future, there would always be a boy, but now that there is none, he has to ask Yuan Meiyun to dress as a man and temporarily muddle through.</p>
<p>Sure enough, once Yuan Meiyun is disguised, who would know that she is a daughter? Her elegant demeanor and quick speech are not those of a handsome young master?</p>
<p>Upon arriving in China, there is naturally a lively scene among relatives and friends. Wang Guilin is even more indescribably happy, and specially prepares a grand banquet to wash away the dust for her.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun's cousin, Han Langan, is a cat-like gluttonous person. Although he is a wealthy young master, he still often steals things in the kitchen. On this day, he saw a large cage of chickens and ducks in the kitchen, and he was even more greedy and ecstatic; so he lifted the chicken cage head and grabbed it, not knowing that this time, the chickens and ducks in the cage seemed to have regained their freedom as prisoners and flew around in all directions. In a narrow kitchen, he smashed cups and plates to pieces, with no place clean. Han Langan was originally very stupid by nature, and seeing this situation, he was at a loss, so he was covered in chicken feathers, duck feathers, and chicken droppings.</p>
<p>This is a scene from "Incarnation Girl" produced by Dahua Company and directed by Fang Peilin. The story is extremely romantic, light, and interesting.</p>
