<h3>蔣委員長報告　救亡禦侮步驟與限度　最近外交途徑並未到達最後關頭　組織國防會議共同負責抵禦外侮</h3>
<p>（南京）蔣委員長於十三日二中全會第二次大會討論議案完畢後、卽向大會報吿、主席團提議組織國防會議事意義、茲誌其原詞如下、各位同志、今天大會所討論幾個提案、都很重要、尤其是西南方面、蕭同志佛成等所提的「目前抗日救亡最低限度之方策」一案、格外重要，因為審查會經鄭重考慮、認為無庸另有决議、現在議程已畢、兄弟代表主席團對本案報吿幾句話、駐留兩廣諸同志的提案、其內容所舉各點、可以說很重要、我們全會對這案、也十分重視、不過中央自從去年舉行第五次全國代表大會以來、差不多沒有一時一刻不在救亡工作上用心、也沒有一時一刻不在救亡工作上用力、今天大會對這案說母庸另有决議之决議、一方面固然由於提案本身的手續沒有完備、一方而也因為這幾年來西南同志與中央太隔膜、完全不明白中央的情形、所以纔有這個提案、現在乘這個機會來盡情說明一下、我們臨到這個國難嚴重關頭、應當不惜犧牲來禦侮救亡、這不僅是我們中央委員抱這種心理、就是全國的小學生也都念念不忘這一句話、可以說、凡是中國人、誰都知道要救亡、誰都知道要禦侮、但是禦侮救亡、應採取怎樣的步驟、最重要在定一個明白的限度、以為决定國策的標準、這個最低限度、就是去年全國代表大會所决定的、「和平未到完全絕望時期、决不放棄和平、犧牲未到最後關頭、亦不輕言犧牲」這句話、這幾句話或者兩廣方面還沒有明白、以為怎樣纔算是非放棄和平不可的最低限度、怎樣纔算是最後的關頭、這是我們許多不來中央的同志們不明白中央方針的所在、現在我再把這幾句决議的意思、就是所謂最低限度的解釋、明白說明一卞、希望各位同志、尤其是兩廣來的各位同志、特別注意、以便回去之後、承中央意思、傳達中央對外交所抱的最低限度、就是保持領士主權的完整、任何國家要來侵擾我們領土主權、我們絕對不能容忍、我們絕對不訂立任何侵害我們領土主權的恊定、並絕對不容忍任何侵害我們領土主權的事實、再明白些說、假如有人强迫我們欲訂承認偽國等損害領土主權的時候、就是我們不能容忍的時侯、就是我們最後犧牲的時侯、這是一點、其决從去年十一月全國代表大會以後、我們如遇有領土主權再被人侵害、如果用盡政治外交方法而仍不能排除這個侵害，就是要危害到我們國家民族之根本的生存、這就是為我們不能容忍的時候、到這時候我們一定作最後之犧牲、所謂我們的最低限度、就是如此、但是這半年來、外交的形勢、大家相信並未到達和平絕望時期、與其說是和平絕望，反不如說是這半年來較之以前的形勢、還有一綫的希望、我敢說最近外交途徑、並未達到最後關頭、這是可為各位同志明白報告的、現在外交上的情勢、更加複雜、記得在去阿戰爭、剛才發生、勝負未能懸斷、世人當然同情於阿比西尼亞、不幸的結果、現在阿比西尼亞已經失敗了、但是我們也不能說因為阿比西尼亞是失敗了、我們不能做第二個阿比西尼亞、我們要挽救國家的危亡、維護民族的生存、我們决不怕做阿比西尼亞、我們雖則不怕做阿比西尼亞、我們也不是願意做阿此西尼亞，假使全國同胞全黨同志、能够一律服從中央指揮、中國决不會做阿比西尼亞、我們在國家民族生死存亡的關頭、一切處置决斷、不能不特加愼重、我們决不能輕舉妄動、致陷國家民族於萬刦不複之地、現在阿比西尼亞是亡國了、我們一方面看到阿國的精神、固然很同情、但同時想到阿比西尼亞的人民、在空虛的國際評判之下、所受的侮辱、所受的痛苦、實在不堪聞問了、現在我們中國生死存亡的大權、可以說操在我們本黨手上、尤其是全體中央委員、更要担負這個責任是、我們是不是在此和平未到絕望之路，而自己偏要來走絕路呢、國家可以不致滅亡的時候、而偏要使他滅亡呢、我們是不是為了一時的意氣、或希望個人的榮名、隨隨便便的孤注一擲、把國家民族的前途完全去葬送呢、在這個時候、如果我們本黨同志、眞是公忠謀國的人、我想决不出此的、我們很知道在兩廣的同志、允其是兩廣的武裝同志、因為不明瞭外交和軍事的關係、更沒有了解中央的方針和準備、致有過去種種隔膜誤解和錯誤的行動發生出來、今天主席團提出組織國防會議一案、主要的意義、就是希望各地方的軍事當局、能够共同一致、來中央參加討論、對於各項决議辦法、大家可以澈底明瞭、一旦發生事變、也可以團結一致、共同負責來抵禦外侮、所以現留兩廣各同志的提案、雖手續不完備及事實隔閡未能成立、而主席團的提案已够對其提案有相當表示、能够大家一致地去推行、也就可貫澈全國同胞同志的希望、這是本席在今天會議完畢時、對於主席團提案、及到會諸同志的苦心的一些說明、希望各位同志、尤其是兩廣來的各位同志、予以注意、並轉達未到會的同志、一致瞭解、（十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>國聯對意制裁的失敗。對於集體安全制度興和平勢力。實是個最重犬的打擊。當『道』的勢力遭受了若干的挫折時。『魔』的陰影也就越顯越大。這是當然的事。最近德奧的妥協與德意集團的形成。就是個最顯明的例子。德奧在過去數年中。本是積不相容的二個同文同種的日爾曼國家。而在十一日晚上。二國却突然宣佈成立親善恊定。德國承認奧國的充分主權。二國相的各不干涉內政。並聲明這與意奧匈三國恊定的精神完全不相衝突。奧國內閣且以此改組。任命著名親德派賀斯台勞為不管部閣員。史蜜特為外交部長。這恊定成立以後。不但過去德奧的糾紛可暫時不再發生。就是對於中歐以及整個歐洲政局的關係。都是非常重大的。</p>
<p>積不相容的德奧。現在為什磨會突然成立妥協呢。要說明這個問題。我們就得來考察一下二國過去的關係與中歐的國際形勢。德奧原是同文同種的日爾曼國家。大戰以後二國合併的傾向是非常濃厚的。一九三一年的德奧關稅同盟。就是二國合併之初步計劃的實現。但德奧合併對於協約國的利益。尤其是法國的稱覇歐洲。是有重大妨害的。所以他們極力阻止奧國被併於德。在聖日爾曼條約中就有不准德奧合併的規定。到國社黨上台以後。希特勒的併奧運動。更積極進行。可是這時奧國的大部人民。却反對併入德國而意國更乘機援助奧國。反對德國的南下政策。因為如德國併奧後。意德二國邊界卽形連接。這於慕索里尼稱覇中歐的野心。是有很大妨碍的。因此當一九三四年七月國社黨在維也納發動武力政變。槍殺奧總理陶爾斐斯時。意國就立刻陳兵北境。準備以武力對付德國的吞併運動。此後奧國就一直睡在黑衫首相的懷抱中。反對希特勒的南下政策。但是到了意國發動東菲的侵略戰爭後。因受國聯的經濟制裁。國際地位非常孤立時。意國就轉而對德國暗送秋波了。而德國也因為廢棄凡爾賽和的。積極擴充軍備。向外發展以致受到法蘇以及小協約國的包圍。因此對於這侵略陣綫中的同僚。自然也極願携手。最近國聯對意的制裁雖已撤消。地中海的互助協定雖已宣布廢止。但左翼人民陣綫的勢力已在歐洲大形發展。因此這二個反社會主義之法西斯的難兄難弟。就更有急謀携手的必要。德意過去的嫌隙都集中於奧國問題。現在要謀携手合作。自然非先解决這個問題不可。好在奧政府是在羅馬製造的。於是經過了黑衫首相的斡旋。德奧親善恊定。於十一日在二國京城同時宣佈了。</p>
<p>照此說來。德奧的妥協。我們不能僅視為德國與奧國二國間的單純問題。而應視為德國與意國間的問題。是德意勾結的初步條件。德意的勾結。我們不但從奧國問題的解决上可以看出來。就在意德二國最近的關係上。也可以看出來。試舉幾件重要的事實。上月二十四日意國航空决長兼空軍參謀長伐萊將軍往聘柏林。於二十六日同德國簽訂商用航空協定。以十年為期。這協定在經濟與政治上都有重大的意義。因為它一方面規定雙方得在羅馬與北海之間開辦航綫。一方面並許德國得在意屬多特坎尼斯羣島之一　（在愛琴海東）。設立飛機塲。前者可橫斷法蘇二國所經營的航綫。後者則使德國得以挿足於地中海。隔了二天。（六月二十八日）德意又簽訂商務協定。增進二國的經濟關係。到了最近。二國更成立諒解。德國承認意國併吞阿比西尼亞。與保證奧國的獨立。而意國則承認德國向東發展並收回舊有殖民地。二國對於一切國際問題。也取共同的態度。意德二國的勾結。其範圍不但包括奧國。而且還拉攏匈牙利與波蘭在內。匃牙利因羅馬議定書的簽訂。早已入於意國勢力影響之下。波蘭也因一九三四年與德訂立不侵略條的。已經投入柏林的懷中。這樣一來。所謂威廉第二所主張之「中歐洲集團」（Mittel　Europa）。也就以侵略集團的形式出現了。</p>
<p>這個侵略集團的形成。其主要目的。自然是在對付法蘇與小協約國所領導的和平陣綫。自此集團形成以後。意國就可以稱覇中歐。而恢復其東非戰爭前的重要地位。至於德國。則更可跳出目前的國際孤立地位。而積極進行共第三帝國的向外侵略政策。其主要的對象。就是向東發展與向東南侵入巴爾幹半島。並企圖收回舊有的殖民地。所以這個侵略陣綫勢力的發展。對於國際和平與集體安全制度。實是個最重大的打擊。影響所及。不但包括歐洲各國。而且還及於整個的世界。和平陣綫的勢力雖因此受到很大的威脅。但是「道」的勢力終究能克服「魔」的勢力。因為和平是全世界最大多數的人民所擁護的。而侵略政策則不過是極少數的野心家所積極贊助的罷了。</p>

<h3>南巡佳話</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>北山的瀑布</p>
<p>各地的名勝古蹟、關係民族文化、極為重要、據內政部調查、全國各省的名勝古蹟、以浙江一省最多、計一千八百七十二處、而浙江又以浙東多、浙東更以金華的北山、最負盛名、</p>
<p>北山距城十五公里、山上多石岩孔　、淸泉瀑布、到處湧現、故草木易於滋生、將外長點染成一幅葱綠峻秀的美畫、那裏所謂「居山吃山」的老百姓、還想法子把石岩炸開、燒成石灰、挑到城裏去賣、石灰是肥料、正逢肥田的季節、一路見十二三歲的小孩、都挑着小擔子去賣、畢竟年靑、他那急趨碎步、弓腰喘氣的樣兒、看來眞覺可憐、</p>
<p>幽徑導入山阱、飛　　　之聲、好像山靈奏的　　　、一直把你奏層、外洞空曠似深星、高寬各四五丈、深約六七丈、有淸泉五道、自內洞小口滔滔流出、扒的混身發燒、一進洞　覺涼澈心腑、內洞就由那個流水口進去、口徑不過四五尺、而且幾乎被水流灌滿、尋樣陰森黑暗的水洞、說是大膽的一闖進去、就有盡在火宮的奇景、莫說你不相信、就是徐霞客當年來遊、也許也已進去、而尊腿仍老在洞外、後仰臥在一個特製的木盆中、險些兒擦去鼻子似的划進去、約長兩丈、捨盆登陸、依著煤氣燈光一看、的確又是別有洞天、假若要用以躱避鐵鳥下蛋、起碼可以躱藏五千人、四壁乳鐘·岩石·琳瑯滿目、洞頂突起兩條岩紋、一靑一黃、蜿蜒飛舞、極似龍形、首尾鱗爪都有、眞是活龍活現、此洞因名變龍洞、稱流水為變龍泉水、再曲折跌滑向西進、尤多奇形怪像、有的似獅象鳳龜、有的似雲月流水、不勝枚舉、沿着東壁由原口折出、遊程約有半里多、</p>
<p>出雙龍洞、再仰上一坡、也只半里路、卽到「冰壺洞」、雙龍洞是橫的、好像橫放着的葫蘆、口很大、腰極細、後部寬大扁平、心　稀奇古怪、冰壺洞是直的、口小腹大而深、一步步的小心翼翼地　着踏磴下去、計踏磴（卽就地刻成的石級）二百六十級、初下二三十級、二百六十級、初下二三十級、天光漸暗而黑、冷氣襲人、隱聞潺潺水聲、再下三四十級、忽見長約十丈的大瀑布從頂面岩壁中懸空傾瀉而下、　聲隆隆似雷、冰花玉屑、飛濺身上、如遇細雨、水力煽動暗風、更呼呼的吹得你怕了想後轉、可是再鼓着勇氣下去、便繞行於瀑布之後、瀑布落處、並無深潭積水、隔瀑仰望洞口、慘白的一綫天光、正把瀑布照成一幅水晶廉、更覺有一種說不出的欣慰美感、旁的瀑布、在山外、此則在肚子裏、恐遊盡全國名勝、也難再得如此奇景、續跴流斜下二三十級、見水從洞底幽然流去、傳上自「朝眞洞」來、下流雙龍洞、三洞同在一山、皆西向、此說很有可能性、折出時、因煤氣燈光、誤觸蝙蝠窟、百十成羣、撲撲亂飛、</p>
<p>朝眞洞在冰壺洞之上、還有二里路、怕去了誤着歸時、僅坐在冰壺洞外的「冰壺亭」、向導遊者問問情形、該洞又稱上洞、洞口刻有「三十六洞天」五字、洞門開朗、旁出內洞很多、遊蹤常到之處、深達里許、洞徑平斜寬仄無定、大槪深入一二里的地方、有半月形的孔洞、曲折通光下、呌「一綫天」、再進「天池」壁間、傳刻有「止步」二字、係朱文公筆、</p>
<p>前面說的那「冰壺亭」、係十八軍軍長羅卓英新建的、遊人從熱氣中將　入冰壺、或從低溫冰壺中　出、都有在此亭稍憇的必要、亭工未竣、無有匾聯、聞稱、「冰壺亭」、是否如此、後來在衢縣看見羅氏、又忘了問他、亭下有「金華觀」、據考舊稱雲屏道觀、剏自成周、列國安期生、晋時赤松子、都在此羽化、唐代始改今名、元後又遭湮沒、現址是民國二十二年、邑人黃維時等新闢的、係旅館性質、可供遊人住食、附近還有講堂洞·（南朝劉峻讀書處）鹿田書院·石棋盤·盤泉·煉丹山·等名勝、故春秋遊人很多、</p>
<p>金華的斗牛</p>
<p>金華不僅風物秀美、在中國史學士、還有相當地位、所謂浙東學派、卽溯源於此、可是金華雖然自來文風很盛、學校敎育發達、但民間有種迷信的陋俗、呌做「鬥牛」、每逢冬夏雨季、還不時的相沿舉行、鬥時風聲遠佈、觀者人山人海、那種熱烈鼓舞的情况、比任何　票的運動會、還要强幾分、雖然說他沒有多少意義、</p>
<p>鬥牛、畫通又稱操牛、鬥時、却各有特名、有稱武松·維成·蘇天霸·或薜仁貴的、有稱什麼·英雄掛·霉　臉·大花旦·小隨便的、都由養牛的農人、隨意取好、宣佈在表演的節目單上、凡預備出師去鬥的牛、在牛主的眼目中、哪裏還是一隻牛、簡直是一員立將鋒破敵、揚名聲顯主人的大將、對於這大將快要去立汗「牛」功勞的頭幾天、主人對於他的飼養問題、眞有「解衣衣之推食食之」之槪、每餐必好好的熬給他一鍋糯米稀飯、內裏調和上幾兩鴉片烟、或另以參湯美酒佐餐、夏日天熱、還替他搔癢、打蒼蠅、用扇煽涼、夜間還要掛給他布帳、以防蚊虫打擾淸夢、據說如此能使牛將軍威力大增、臨陣驍勇無敵、至於所花銀錢不繼、縱借貸亦所不辭、牛將軍威力大增、牛主人固求之不得、但牛性大發、任意奔踢、踏傷觀衆、也不是好玩藝、因此鬥牛場、不選空曠的平地、乃是又爛又粘的水田、鬥時把牛將軍一對對的依序牽入、各以頭角相頂鬥、略有歪斜、快要頂着頸項、便由公正人把他撥正、一直頂到必有一牛不支而退、勝敗才定初局、以後還要再來兩次、載局始告全盤結束、同時鬥的、不止一對、各對在各對的地盤廝殺、不會殃及池魚、就是水泥絆蹄之功、</p>
<p>鬥勝了的牛、主人便在他崢讚的頭角上、披上紅彩、挿上金花、鳴鑺開道、到上遊行示「榮」、那時眉飛色舞的牛主人、牽着耀武揚威的牛將軍、眞有當年「狀元打馬過街」、不可一世的氣槪、親朋或觀衆、少不了也要用紙砲花紅來祝賀、還有牽羊担酒、來認「牛親家」的、情誼的熱烈、還勝過兒女親家、事後所謂「飛鳥盡、良弓藏」、卸下金花紅彩的牛將軍、當然請牠回廐吃老草、假若牛將軍不懂得主人的用意、臨陣不肯大賣力氣、以致「再衰三竭」地敗下來、或者被人家盲目地牽往水泥灘裏、甫與敵將互吻之下、好像自知彼此都是同類、不願任人挑撥相殘、於是回去之後、必被殘忍的主人、認為不祥、把牠驅進屠場、</p>
<p>此種鬥牛風氣、聽說遠自宋仁宗時傳來、用意在於酬神、又說、金華義烏兩縣的土地、硬、（不知何解）不鬥牛、便容易遭回祿之災、或者出人命案、蘭谿的土地不硬、有次鬥牛、反發生火災、以後便無鬥者、年前金華火車站、舉行通車典禮、還轟轟烈烈地鬥過一次、上海杭州人、都來參觀、最近金義交界的某鄕、盛傳又快要鬥牛了、但在此嚴重的酷暑中、誰有心緒、觀此蠢物的自相角觸戰、</p>

<h3>第十一世運會雜訊</h3>
<p>凌氏體操</p>
<p>頃接瑞典消息云、該國决定、於本屆世界運動會在柏林舉行表演「羣衆體操」、藉以宣揚凌氏體操Lin　gache　Gymnansik之凌神此表演定於八月八日下午六時四十五分、於田徑賽比賽後、在運動塲內舉行、出塲表演之瑞典選手男女各六百人、此次「羣衆體操」表演、可發揚凌氏體操之敎育身體方法、對於全身之鍜鍊有莫大關係、及此項體操在瑞典、早已成為民衆運動之事實、</p>
<p>凌氏體操之優點頗多、其最著者乃其「應合性」、因其有此應合性、則無論男女老幼强弱、均可練習之、非如其他運動必須種種條件、非人人所能、欲使參加世界運動會各國體育家對於凌氏體操得相當之認識計、遄典國家體操學會、特預備數種優秀的表演、在世界運動時獻技、瑞典現預備在「國際運動學校協會」先舉行六次表演、以作練習、並同時使一隊十一歲至十五歲男女孩童及男女成人隊、作特別表演、此種表演每次人數為十六人至二十四人、現在瑞典所計畫之擴大表演、為國際運動學校聯會上從來所未見者、故其此次之表演、當能為該會增加無上光榮、</p>

<p>國際籃球協會在最近所舉行之常會席上、决定以世運委員會所指定之籃球塲、作為此屆世運籃球比賽、此外在運動塲旁之網球塲上、另修一籃球塲、專為决賽之用、經詳細檢騐以後、認為球塲球架等、均頗合格、預賽及複賽、均在網球塲之旁設立之籃球比賽、均在下午五六時舉行、故該塲之位置必須採取不受太陽之地方、塲面用特別土質修築、使雨後亦可比賽、國際籃球協會决定一切籃球比賽、均在屋外舉行、並亟端預備使該比賽决不亞於在健身房內、</p>
<p>本屆世運會之「榮譽書」</p>
<p>世運組織委員會將製一種榮譽書、使對於本屆世運贊助者之姓名流傳後世、該書將以德元國首希特拉之簽字起始、繼有各貴賓之簽字、及第一第二第三各項之優勝者之姓名、書之內容、將特別豐富、裝訂又為優美、將定能為一極有價値本屆世界運動會之紀念品、</p>
<p>世運優勝者之檞樹</p>
<p>本屆世運委員會接受圜藝家露特之建議、决定贈送每優勝國小檞樹一支、此樹可帶回本國栽培、以作永久紀念、此樹現已經一年餘之培養、十分暢茂、高的七十生的、生於特製泥盆內、該盆尙有燒成本屈世運之鐘及下列標語、</p>
<p>增長戰勝的光榮　提倡深淡之工業</p>
<p>此小檞樹裝於適宜之手提箱內、以便携帶、並附栽培指南一份、以便日後培養、在船之時、則船主担任培養之責任、按以往經騐、此樹能在任何土地及任何氣候下生活及發展、如此則此樹可作柏林世運之百年紀念、</p>
<p>脚踏車比賽塲</p>
<p>原議建築長期脚踏車跑塲、藉為世運脚踏車比賽之用、因故未能實現、世運組織委員會故决定改築一臨時跑塲、該塲將於七月一號至八月九號成立、位於德國廳旁柏林體育會之運動塲上、交通頗為方便、此塲現由德國著名建築師徐曼負責修造、該建築師為修築此類跑塲之專家、曾在羅馬柏林及其他各大城修築脚踏車跑塲若干、此塲長四百米、寬六米半、灣處高三米、邊高一米六、面積共二千九百八十米、塲旁參觀臺上、可容一千五百人、臺下為運動員之更衣室、塲之周圍可容一萬二千人、該塲於六月十五日起始修築、七月一號卽可在塲上公開練習、此次世運脚踏車比賽為八月六號七號及八號三日、</p>
<p>參觀世運會塲者</p>
<p>最近外國著名人物來德參觀本屆世運會塲及調查世運籌備情形者、頗不乏人、最著者有瑞典國王、丹麥女王、保加利亞世運委員會委員、芬蘭體操及體育會幹事、法國運動部代表及英國國會議員及其他運動團體代表七八人云云、</p>

<h3>糧食　麥價漸與國外接近</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份雖呈平軟、跌度尙微、下午則近遠期同時暴瀉、洋麥報價、芝加哥大跌一元六角半、至一元七八角、坎拿大跌一元三四角、當開價時、以現麥到源日旺、廠方均不願開進、人心自然挫弱、故七八九月份、卽挫跌六七八分、十一十二月份人心尙定、微落三四分、迨至下午開盤、因目下環境未免不佳、業外多頭、經實際敵碼之套售、未免相形見絀、是以各月份均步步狂瀉、照目下之最遠期而言、彷彿已與洋麥合價接近、如果政府關懷民食、一循往例、可以自由訂購、則投機者當難堅持、况乎出新不久、有此現象、終覺不近事理、不識當局是否注意及之也、現麥市面、因廠胃尙佳、客戶扳售、中關貨喊漲一角二分、高貨則祇好三四分、開南京麥四元三角、次三角七分、浦口麥四元四角二分、淮安麥四元四角九分、六合麥四元四角六分、次四角三分、竹鎭麥四元四角八九分、湖熟麥四元四角四分、高郵麥四元四角八分、揚州麥四元三角六七分、漢口麥四元三角二三分、洋河麥四元五有、船麥四元零四分、高至四元二角、山申大阜豐各去三千包、福新去一萬二千包云、</p>

<h3>麵粉交易實際停頓</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午各盤依然平靜、因傳限價一時不能取消、是以雙方交易、停頓居多、並以在此局面之下、多方難免居奇、不肯照限轉賣、故急待了結之空頭、傳聞暗貼以求解决、價則所傳不一、有五分一角至一角半、但不久又傳落至八九分、猶乏接受、此種情形、於事毫無根據、祇可姑妄言之、姑妄聽之而已云、</p>
<p>又各廠現貨仍開一角半、日來各路客帮、已見减退、不若週前之迫急、是以照事推考、如雙方各循事實、當不致發生糾紛云、</p>
<h3>新黃荳續有到滬</h3>
<p>昨日新黃荳又有漢口六月白到滬一百三十五包、九江城門荳七十三包今庚各地收成尙豐、出品身色均佳、行情亦較往年為高、計九江城門荳價開六元、漢口閃月白開六元二角七分、由本街福州帮分去、尙有星期六所到之溫州新荳、因到埠已遲、不及進棧、致延阻兩日、其荳品因新貨關係、發見霉粒、故貨尸祇遷就兜售、當同寗波帮辦去價開五元七角半云、</p>
<h3>秈米慮蒸變貶價求售</h3>
<p>連日客秈市况、幾似步趨而下、一無止境、昨日客帮仍呆、本街初無暢胃、貨主與行販囤戶以天熱求脫、再度貶價以期從速脫手、免被蒸蛀與耗虧斤量、因此售價又小去一角至一角半、交易始稍稍活絡、開出江西機晚四千包、機早一千五百包、其他之米碎米糙米等八百三十七包、湘米五百八十四包、江北糙一百包、全數由本街辦去、後形依然平軟無神云、</p>
<h3>河米市况微有起色　天氣轉凉不致變壞　店方趁低亦多補進</h3>
<p>綀（滬南）昨中帮來源共到十餘號、貨共三千餘石、市况因天時陰晦、人心略定、本街銷塲稍覺活絡、故形形勢帶緊、厚早粳價回起幾分、薄稻包胃南洋帮去三百餘包、行情定局、北洋帮亦去六百餘包、價未開出、杜洋尖隨粳跟上數分、除變元無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）　近日天宮炎熱、河米容易變色、致市價遂日步跌、昨日河下各帮來源略旺、約有三十四五號、因天時轉凉、河下到貨、可以暫守數天、而店方在此短價時間、亦略為補進、故早市白粳去路略動、市百白粳新鮮者轉漲近角、宿次定立、百元價格平定、薄稻到少消活、價形挺秀、尖來貨稍旺、去化平常、價形高者定勢、客尖仍羊屬軟勢、</p>

<h3>暑天上高橋　海濱游泳小紀</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>上海這地方，不是地獄，也不像天堂。一到大暑天，熱烘烘地驕陽，把所有的人，蒸得呌苦連天，活像油鍋裏的螞蟻。住慣鴿棚的人，不消說得，就是高樓大厦的享樂階級，也一樣不能動彈；在這當兒，大家挖空心思，想消夏的塲合，有錢人可以到山明水秀的地方去避署，最苦悶的還是不上不下的中級人士。嘿！難道中級人永遠該挨苦麼？不！不！也得想個法兒，打破天命的謬說。</p>
<p>有人說上海雖然不比靑島，大連，牯嶺，普陀，幸而高橋也有天然的海濱浴塲，那裏一切設備，够你盡情的享受。前天曾結合了十幾位男女良伴，由外灘坐市輪渡直放高橋，時雖火傘高張，而汪中凉風輕拂，暑氣全消，這一小時的水程，你可以看透兩岸的景物，各國的碼頭堆棧，雄居世界第三位的電力廠，洋商紡織廠，還有美孚，亞細亞，德士古等油池，許多經濟侵略的大企業，誠然使我們受巨大的刺激！虧得我們也有新建漁市塲，虬江碼頭，替大家漲了一股氣。到了高橋碼頭，轉乘「拔司」穿過曲折平坦的馬路，已是美麗的鄕村。從烟霧的者市擠到碧綠的原野，格外使你心曠神怡，呌好不絕！</p>
<p>高橋海濱，有廣大的沙灘，幽雅的草廳，一座座蒙古式蓬帳，站定了遠遠望去，島嶼羅列，風帆點點，如入畫中，這般美景，大有留連忘返之槪。穿紅着綠的浴客，不分東洋，西洋，男女老幼，科直色色俱全，看起來外人的興致，比華人更濃，最使人注目的，便是幾位老洋人，坐在海灘上，雙手握着尺把長的白鬚，似乎游得倦了。還有洋老太太們，挺胸凸臀地嬉水，就是五六歲的小郎，也會蛙式游泳。我們這隊人馬，也各自奮勇，下海暢游，直到日落西山，纔盡興歸來。某女士說：「海水浴眞有說不出的愉快，究竟比冷氣間飮冰室寫意得多呢。」也許是她的一得之言。</p>
<h3>高橋海濱</h3>

<h3>也是投機</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>他學某種外國語還是三十年前的事。那時他是位靑年，負大志。憤國事之日非，思學某種外國語；其動機為渡海留學，俾他日學成歸來，可償其救國之宏願。</p>
<p>不幸事與願違，生活的鞭策不約地在他背上且驅且擊，使他的救國宏願，不能不付之泡影；因此某種外國語，他也懶得學習，幷且也無暇學習了。他為衣食，東奔西馳，銖積寸累，迄於今已面團團成富家翁，救國之事，自然不再提起，但他又要想學某種外國語了。</p>
<p>他又想學某種外國語，這是近五年所蓄心的。不過他的心常隨報端某項新聞為轉移。消息緊張，則彼心怦怦然；緩和，則彼又想學某種外國語之心亦為之稍淡。他居常息思：某也已成什麼「通」，某也已榮任某某會社買辦。這些同學少年，入則洋房，出則汽車，家中還都有個善於溫存體貼的外國老婆，實在太寫意了。這不是受某種外國語之賜嗎？我也何人，豈可落伍？</p>
<p>想到這，他的心如海潮般一起一伏，不能自制了，初念六十老翁學打拳，尙貽笑旁人，何况學某種外國語，不免爽然自失。旣念此時不學，將待何時，則又為之勇氣百倍。不過某種外國語，他拋荒已久，甚至連字母都不大認識了，則又奈何！好的，橫直現在什麼「百日通」，什麼「入門」之類的書多得很，買來看看，總不無帮助。如有人問他讀這些書做什麼，他總輕描淡寫地回答道：「將來便當些！」</p>
<h3>弔者大悅</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>上海因了人口擁擠的緣故，所以居室是湫狹的可憐，—當然自造的洋房除外—一適婚喪喜慶，賓友之紛至沓來，螺獅壳裏怎麼做道塲，不得不借那酒樓公所做禮堂，至於喪事開弔的所在，大半是在寺院裏，因為寺院地方寬敞，考究的大半備有廚房，預備幾十席素筵，眞不算一回事，靈堂擺設亦堂皇冠冕，和尙唪經亦舒暢便利，因此人家多化幾個錢也願意。</p>
<p>開弔和喜慶不同，親友都是上午到的，這裏沒有軍樂隊的生意，祗用一班小堂名，坐在出入要口，一見客來，便　　嗚嗚的吹起來了。一個穿着素衣的僕人，高擎引帖，領你到靈堂面前，鼓聲鼕鼕的敲了幾下，你跪拜也可，鞠躬也可；孝子孝孫也匍匐還拜如禮，然後你坐在客廳中，喝喝茶，抽抽香烟，等待一頓豐盛的素餐。</p>
<p>中飯的當兒，酒是一杯杯的篩下，菜是一道道上來，客人歡呼談笑，倒像和喜事一般，只差沒有豁拳吧了，那孝子孝孫，孝女孝媳，這時也開懷暢飮，和親友們同樂一番。</p>
<p>中飯完畢，幾個高興的親友，還拉開桌子，碰他八圈麻將，這樣一來，更把靈堂內一股悲哀之氣，消除凈盡，牌聲劈拍，人語喧鬧，佛號高揚，眞是「死者長瞑」，「弔者大悅」了。</p>
<p>不過我揭開訃文來一瞧，孝子總是說「苫次昏迷」「泣血稽顙」，照理我們憑吊慰藉之不暇，何能更忍心而作樂，可是眞的滿堂悲哀，一片蕭索，我想親友們眞不願來陪淚水咧！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>

<p>第四回　視聽都非浮沉疑復柬　死生可託慷慨寄哀吟</p>
<p>他就是這樣圈了又看，看了又圈，幾幾乎把幾張信紙塗去了一大半。信上塗去了這些字句，當然是不成文理的，若是要寄信給國器的話，這封信只有拋去，再重寫一封的了。他有了這個意思？把塗抹了的信紙，搓成了一個紙團，重新擂墨展紙起來。可是當他把筆提起來的時候，寒空遠遠的送來一聲鷄呌，再向玻璃窗子外看去，那東南角的天脚，似乎有一點魚肚色了。只管寫着信，不想就到了這樣的夜深。同時，自己兩隻脚上，也就發現了一陣凉氣，只管向上部侵襲了來。放下了，接連着打了兩個呵欠，這眼皮是異樣的枯澀，不能不睡了。於是把所已是扔在桌子角落裏了。於是拿着燈在桌子角落裏照耀了一番，把那個紙團找了出來，照樣也撕得粉碎，然後送到痰盂子裏去。這還不放心，又四週的看了一看，覺得實在沒有什麼字跡了，方才上床去安睡。這一夜的辛苦，不亞於害了一塲小病，因之睡在床上，連身也不會翻，一睡就是八九小時。家裏人在早晨，也曾來呼換過他兩三次。在朦朧中，但含糊的說是病了，依然睡去。直到吃午飯的時候，江太太特意走上樓來看他，他才起床。想到昨晚上的事，心裏頭十分煩惱，吃飯的時候，倒眞的吃不下去什麼。吃飯以後，索興不上學了。他家裏人以為他身體有些不舒服，當然，也就不去催他。可是在外面有一個人希望他今日上學，比平常的日子，還要濃厚十倍。這是誰，就是那個寫信來試他的章國器了。他必在發信之後，時間越長，情緒也就越是緊張。心裏不住的在那裏想着，假使他要生氣的話，他一定會寫信來回復兩句。照着時候計算，信已寫好，該投到郵政局了。若是他對於那封信，認為還可以接受呢，那麼，也有回信的。信當然在路上了，是禍是福，必定在幾小時以後可以揭曉。國器在家裏先是這樣想，出提門來，要上學堂去的時候，在路上走着，好像演困難的算題，得了一個答案一樣，滿臉全是笑容，連連的點了幾下頭。想着，何必等他的回信。在路上就可遇着他，看個明白了。他若是高興的時候，臉上一定是笑嘻嘻的。他若是不高興的時候，一定板着臉子，甚至乎會罵出來。不，不，他不是那種人。想到了這樣地方，順便就擺了兩擺頭，把這一點兒意思，給表示出來（四七）</p>

<h3>防空防毒常識展覽會印象記（下）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>此外又有戰地救護的展覽，裏面包括三部份　息樣搜索傷兵，　怎樣搬運傷兵，　怎樣救護傷兵。內容很豐富，尤其是搬運傷兵部份，拍了許多照片，大都的照片是在毀於敵人砲火下的吳淞中國公學內攝取的，據說他們在那兒拍照有個原因，就是要使民衆回味一下以前的創痛。關於救護人員和民衆避難必携之救護用品亦略有陳列。救護圖表下面又有很惹人注意的標語「我們需要救護人員和需要戰士一樣」「救護人員是戰士的慈母」「完善的救護設備能增加軍隊的勇氣」「我們不讓忠勇的戰士冤死一個」「多救活一個傷兵便多保留一分力量」戰地救護能謹愼，後方醫治省功夫」「許多受傷的戰士耐不住痛苦百將腦袋撞碎」等等，民衆防毒和救護展覽是同濟大學軍事救護隊負責籌備的，他們的意思，想喚起民衆和中大學生對於戰地救護加以深切的注意，因為現有的救護人員離實際需要相差很遠。</p>
<p>該會另闢一角陳列民衆防空防毒等書籍。</p>
<p>會塲上有幾種關於防空防毒救護常識等小册子出售，據說該會發售該項書籍價格力求低廉，大約幾個銅元就能買一本。</p>
<p>該會展覽期暫定三星期。閉幕後再在各地靑看會輪流展覽。</p>
<p>這次展覽會的規模雖不大，而喚起民衆注意防空防毒救護等項的功效却不小。還有一件事値得提及：聞該會一部份展覽圖表據某界當局觀察後以為帶有侵略性質竟加以干涉。後經靑年會外籍幹事一再解釋，才許陳列。在這種環境之下，看這樣的展覽會，有怎樣的感覺？想去參觀的各位定能體會的！</p>
<p>準備！準備！這是民衆的準備！</p>

<p>遙憐幼客滯他邦，故國恩仇豈易忘，夢裏慈親雙　雪，一行相對話家常。萬蒲艾劍閣門旁，艷虎　頭顫嫩黃，斜霧橫烟飛不斷，故園今日又端愓。離愁無計異分陰，廿載同懷寸草心，寄與畫紈遲未達，到時天氣料秋深。此為十年前翠兒寄與實兒之詩，其時實兒在日本，予在杭州過端午，亦嘗有詩，與翠兒之第二首略同，亦咏節物者也。吾杭舊俗，每逢節日，必有一處世世相傳之節物，大都具有一種科學作用，不管普遍的衛生淸潔運動，例如冬至前後掃舍宇，淸明前後掃墓，是由一家淸潔，而且遍及於四鄕無人之處，亦淸潔矣。端陽二字以端為正，日行中軌，正直無偏，礦直正午之時，稱之為天中節，一年惟此一日一時正與十一月十五夜之子時，月行天中，同一軌道，昔人之詩，所謂人生幾見月當頭者，卽是此夜，非中秋也。裸虫之穴，每在溫地深處，雖驚蟄雷動，亦仍伏而不出，蓋畏寒也。惟在午月午日午時，日光直射地下，無孔不入，正與暗室之中，門窗隙孔，射入斜陽，人目所見之野馬相同，地中有水，因而發生蒸氣，裸虫無甲，自不能堪，於是亟謀遷徙，而蛇蝎蜈蚣　蠰蝦　等五毒之虫，皆出現於地面，旣出於地，日炙尤烈，於是匿於陰僻之處，卒至欲歸不得其門，永久居留，卽為人患，廈夜納凉，偶爾驚觸，卽被蠆傷，彼蓋自衛，初非有意蠆人亦正與蜂之刺同也。古人深知物理，乃思預防之策，先於五月初一之前一夜，於門角墻根，遍灑風化石灰，以收其濕，並以預防蛇虫避匿到此，因石灰一經收濕，卽成苛性鈣，與苛性鈉鉀之效用相同，能灼皮膚，裸虫遇之，必感劇痛，不敢近也。初五之日，則於正午之時，用炭盆燒蒼术白芷為烟，以熏房戶，更用燒酒調化雄黃，以　四陬，凡此設施，皆為防止毒虫侵入之計，蓋以二養化炭，用為消毒之劑，蒼术燥濕，白芷殺虫，雄貢含砒，實具理化效用，凡欲蠢動之虫，聞此氣味，深恐中毒致斃，　必反向裏鑽，縱不窒息至死，亦已更下一層，欲出不得，過此一時，日偏於西，卽凡直道　孔隙，不受日光，所有蒸鬰之氣，自然揮發無遺，但使居之能安，自必不思遷地為良矣。至以蒲艾懸之門戶，則防　外蛛絲，避日而入室內，帳額所懸，復加以蒜，則以蒜臭能避蚊蠅，且以備作病中針灸之用，大凡針灸，無不用艾，而水灸則用蒜片貼之，可不用針，婦女每於端午日以蒜片貼兩太陽穴，以療頭風，或患久年癆瘵，則用蒜泥敷背脊骨，謂之水灸，蓋與西醫之用吊炎藥劑，同理也。引病外出，必用吊炎之劑，斑蟊有毒，因不如蒜之穩且便耳。小兒額際塗雄黃者，為防瘡癤，服雄黃酒者，為防夏日冷飮，易生大腸菌耳，是皆取其含砒，正與西醫之用血淸注射，亦同一理，而且惠及行路之人，凡有中暑卒倒者，任取何家門首所懸蒲艾，調水飮之，無不可以救急，淸明揷柳，每至端節，始行換去，柳之用途，在取所含之柳酸，能治痘瘡，凡患痘者，每因感受風寒，倒回不出，血毒內陷，卽以致死，惟用水楊柳煎湯浴之，卽可重復透發，蓋與西醫之用水楊酸者，亦同一理。</p>

<h3>疰夏</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>天氣的寒冷及溫暖，對於人體的健康，有顯著的影響；酷熱的夏裏，人們比較容易生病，誰也知道的。</p>
<p>夏季最多見的病症，如急性胄腸炎，霍亂，傷寒，痢疾，中暑，癤瘡等外，還有所謂痊夏。</p>
<p>痊夏是什麽病？在我手邊僅有的幾本新醫書內，找來尋去，查不出可以相當的病名。舊醫謂痊夏為夏痿的俗稱：痿者，手足痿軟而無力，節緩縱而不收；其發於夏日者，日夏痿。日本民間，則稱之為夏瘦，言夏天身體贏瘦也。童年的記憶，最是深刻。筆者在十齡左右時代，每逢到了夏季，總是胃納欠佳，面黃肌瘦，精神頽唐，沒精打樂，好臥；天氣凉爽一點，身體就輕快得多。年歲老的人，都說這是痊夏。別個小孩子以及大人也有這樣的。</p>
<p>痊夏的原因，舊醫說由於脾胃薄弱，停有濕熱及留飮所致。不過在寒冷的季節，何以沒有這些現象，却未說個明白，未免缺憾。原來氣侯的冷熱，與人體生理的機能，大有親密的關係。試看我們養的狗吧，冬季他常喜歡蜷伏，這是因為天氣寒冷，要使身體面積縮小，减小體溫的放散，俾能達到體溫保持的目的；但到了夏矢，尤其酷熱的時侯，卽使他伏在地上，自然不是蜷伏了，他的頭常常昂起，舌頭掛在外邊，不斷的喘息，這樣的舒展他的肢體，張口露舌的急迫呼吸，是要增加體溫的放散，防止體溫的蓄積。這種生活適應，是看得見的，共他我們看不見的，多哩。</p>
<p>準此，人體在炎熱的夏裏，因為氣溫增高，生理的機能起諸種適應，以求健康得維持常態，無疑議的在想像之中。如其此種適應機能因其他素因發生障礙，身體自然感覺不適，在我的私見，以為疰夏的成因，却是在此。</p>
<p>就我個人幼時的體騐及開業後觀察所得，痊夏的症候是：食思不振，四肢乏力，精神倦怠，懶於作業，頭昏腦漲，心胸苦悶，坐立不安，氣色萎頓，體重减輕。這樣組疏簡率的觀察，眞是可笑之至；然而在我所處的環境，現在卽使遇到痊夏的病人，要作較詳密的各項檢查，以充實我的記述，比較的非常困難。</p>
<p>我們萬萬不可因為在醫學先進國家文獻裏沒有見到關於痊夏病症的記載，而否認痊夏在我國存在。身為中華國民，對於中華風土國有的病症，應負有研究的責任，如果讀了幾本外國醫書，而漠視祖國固有的病症，這是落伍，不是科學醫者。</p>
<p>本症的治療，在舊醫是淸暑，益氣，健脾，扶胃。我家屢代靑囊世業，當我幼時每年痊夏痊得一塌糊塗的時候，父大人雖然愛子心切，却沒有叨蒙賜苦水　我渴；氣候稍徵凉爽，或者一到金風送暑之時，我便完全恢復健康了。這樣看來，本症也是可待期治療的。</p>
<p>依我淺陋的見解，本症雖是關於氣溫增高而發生，但身體虛弱，神經質者及患　蟲的人，是更易促成。尤其是小兒痊夏，不可不注意驅蟲。這一點是由我的兒子身上得來的一點經騐。</p>
<p>關於本病的治療，遷地療法不切實用，藥物的對症療法，沒有意義，最要緊在排除促成的素因，而夏季生活法改進，尤為首要，是可以預防痊夏發生，或减輕痤夏症狀的。茲條述如下：</p>
<p>（一）必須每日入浴一次，使皮膚淸潔，俾皮膚的新陳代謝的機能活潑。浴水的溫度，隨各人所好。</p>
<p>（二）如其能有機會而且能耐受的話，每日淋浴（浴稱蓮蓬頭浴）一次，也非常之好；在熱帶地方的居民，每日必須冲凉，天氣雖然熟得那樣倦人，但冲凉之後，却神淸氣爽，健康不致發生障碍。</p>
<p>（二）飮食宜淸淡，肥膩的肉類少用。富於脂肪的食物，在人體肉可以發生多量的熱出來，在氣溫已經增高的環境，是不需要的。</p>
<p>（四）夜眠務求充星酣熟。晚凉之後，應卽就寢，不可夜遊，早睡早起，午睡片刻，也有助於精神的振作。</p>
<p>（五）飮料如開水，淸茶都可充分飮用。水分的供給，對於體溫的放散，有重要的意義。水果適量，對於維他命的輸入及大便的排泄，也大有助益。</p>
<h3>德國北海羣島視察記（中）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>居住該島之人民，凡欲海浴及施行空氣港者，均非常便利，因其住宅之前，卽為沙灘，初無跋涉之勞，黃沙極為細軟，幼童在此就浴，可無危險發生，全島共有運動塲三處，有在蔽風之森林中者。</p>
<p>其風向多來自西方，幾盡為大洋空氣，海水之溫度，受熱較易，五月中卽可海浴，卽以空氣中之溫度而論，如一九三三年十二月十五日在特來斯登地為零度下二十四度，而福而島為零度下二度，該島最冷之日，無有逾零度以下五、六度者，以是而觀，該島與大陸氣候相較，幾有二十度之差別，至於日光照射之時間，其長久亦為德國諸療養所之冠，如在一九三三年十二月中為六十四·六點鐘為日光照射時間。（按歐北天氣，於冬時多雲而雨，與我國不同。）</p>
<p>於該島療養之中心點有音樂亭網球塲考而夫球擊鎗處海狗塲帆船遊行諸種設備，除此以外，全島尙有十七小村落，均深藏於林箐之中，與世無爭，其禮拜堂建自第十三世紀，為有名古跋之一公墓，卽在共旁，雜花如錦，濃蔭如覆，景殊淸幽，該島之博物院，共收藏極為豐富，凡關於地質學植物學動物學歷史及民問故事，無不大備，而尤以關於天文及海洋氣候之諸種標本，最稱名貴，此蓋由於該島創辦人海白林博士畢生毅力之所致，初非一朝一夕之功也。</p>
<p>由醫學上觀察之，則共地空氣潔靜，含有濕氣，而氣候無激烈之變化，對於呼吸器官，非常有益，而海浴光浴，對於人體方面，其皮膚可有較久之溫度保特力，若以新陳代謝而論，雖人體熱力（卡羅里Kalorien）之消耗，幾將增及一倍，而蛋白質以及鈣質憐質，凡人體主要之物質，反可增多其儲藏量，故可消失諸多戚染過敏性，換言之，卽對於傳染病可增强其抵抗力，據該島之專家言，謂此種抵抗力之偉大，幾如白喉症之與白喉血淸之功用相同焉。</p>
<p>由是而觀（一）凡上氣官道鼻腔氣管枝之發炎狀態，以及氣管枝喘息，（二）皮膚及腺結核，氣管枝結核，骨及關節疾病，（三）兒童之發育障礙，全身虛弱，（四）消化器不良，食慾减退，神經性胃腸炎，（五）貧血神經性之心臟障礙，血被循環不良，（六）工作過度，及疾病之神經衰弱症，（七）重症以後之復元期，尤以呼吸器疾病為允甚，以上諸症，俱為適合海洋療養之原則者。</p>
<p>反之，其不適合海洋療養者，為肺結核腎及膀胱疾患心臟疾病惡性新生物羊癲瘋諸症。</p>
<p>療養之時間，普通為六星期，但在慢性或頑固之發炎，如氣喘症者，則需時三月至六月之久，允堪注意者，為該島冬日療養之功效，在一九二八年之冬季，該島有三千六百五十人前往療養，大多均為發炎之患者而在大陸氣候不易治療者，故該島有一個冬季之價値等於兩個夏天之自誇語也。</p>
<p>該島有市政管理處，專門醫師如小兒科外科骨科均有，又有藥房牙醫運動房療養院自然科學研究院學校幼稚園海狗院郵政局電報局電話局等，於交通則有飛機輪船，生活程度，每日的四或五馬克卽足。</p>
<h3>福而島之漢堡兒童療養院</h3>
<p>歷史在十七世紀中，英國醫生Russel氏提倡海洋具有治療功用，其後法人亦有附和之者，其第一海洋醫院之成立，則在一七九二年，在馬加脫Margate地方，德國大學敎授裴氏Beneke則於一八八一年在該島創辦第一個德國海洋醫院，卽為今日之漢堡兒童療養院是也。但未數月，裴氏卽行去世，共醫師均來自倫敦及馬加脫者，是為輸入海洋治療學之始，在世界大戰中，此種助力，盡行消失，於一九二一年漢堡馬丁尼先生，Martini毅然將該院收買而改建之，如冬日療養之設備，水氣暖具之裝置，愛克司光，以及一切最新設備，於兒童療養之不可或缺者，莫不設傭完全。</p>
<p>適應症　凡兒童患有慢性發炎症，腺病，肺臓以外之結核症，氣管枝喘息，全身虛弱，發育不全等，均屬海洋療養之適應症，但在心臟及神經病之兒童，是否可以前往療養，須加以特殊之注意，又該院不收重病患者。</p>
<p>治療方法　醫生之職務，為訂定橫臥療法之時間，又太陽燈蘇魯克司燈空氣浴日光浴海水浴魚肝油等，均為常用之治療方法，對於看護一層，尤為注意，血液檢查，亦極重要，有化騐室專門管理。</p>
<p>療養力之源泉，如日光風力與海水等，其應用之時間及數量，均有職員為之注意。</p>
<p>治療期間　自正月至四月為冬季治療期，可收容一百個兒童，自四月至十月為夏季治療期，可收容二百七十個兒童，又自十月至十一月為秋季治療期，可收容二百個兒童，每期中之一個治療期，為五十天，每年之十二月為放假期，俾全院職員得以休息。</p>
<p>治療成績　自以天時及本來之體質為標準，大概而論，每個兒童在短時間內，可增高一生的米突之體高，又重量可平均增加六至七。</p>

<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（八十八）腎盂炎</p>
<p>什麼呌做腎盂炎？</p>
<p>這是腎臟的腎盂內，因細菌的侵入而起的炎症</p>
<p>那幾種細菌可以侵入該部而至發炎呢？</p>
<p>原發的腎盂炎，普通是因為大腸菌的侵入；續發的腎盂炎，大都是傷寒桿菌，流行性感冒菌，或近鄰臟器的炎症波及而起。此外也有因為腎盂內結石，寄生蟲等的刺激而起的。</p>
<p>發生腎盂炎時，病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>腎盂炎的病狀，不外尿的變化，腎臟部的疼痛，發熱和神經症狀等。</p>
<p>尿的變化怎樣？</p>
<p>病人排泄的尿中，見有膿球和腎盂上皮細胞。尿呈酸性反應，量多而薄，有時還有蛋白質，或混血液。</p>
<p>腎臟部的疼痛是怎樣的？</p>
<p>腎臟部自發性疼痛，或因壓迫而起疼痛。疼得很劇烈，波及輸尿管或膀胱，但也有完全沒有疼痛的。</p>
<p>發熱的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>病人發熱，不很正規；是弛張性，有時以惡寒虞慄而發高熱的。</p>
<p>神經症狀怎樣？</p>
<p>神經症狀有頭痛，譫語，和昏矒的。這些病狀，都因為腎機能欠缺，致起血液中毒和尿毒症之故。</p>
<p>這種病的經過，大概要多少時間</p>
<p>腎盂炎的經過，視原病而有不同。凡續發於產褥和急性傳染病，或膀胱炎的，經過較快。淋疾性腎盂炎，以高熱和腎臟部疼痛為主，經過較緩。</p>
<p>怎樣診斷腎盂炎？</p>
<p>祗須栓查尿中有無膿球，腎盂上皮，並參考有無腎臟的避部疼痛或行膀胱鏡檢查，可以確定診斷。</p>
<p>腎盂炎的療法是怎樣的？</p>
<p>在發熱期中，令病人安靜臥床，上體要抬高，食物要避去刺激性的，多喝各種湯水飮料。</p>
<p>局部疼病時，用什麼方法處置？</p>
<p>行溫罨法，溫濕布或貼用湯婆。</p>
<p>應該用什麼藥劑治療？</p>
<p>可用熊果葉煎劑，六烯四錏，海爾密托而，薩羅，Borovertin　Trypaflavin等劑。近來用酸性飮料的內服，據云可以使尿呈酸性而阻止病菌。或五千倍的硝酸銀液洗滌腎盂，者有效。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（三七）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一八六問）　牙痛為什麼必定要請牙醫生診治</p>
<p>答　因為牙痛的原因，自己很難找出來的，必定要經過牙醫生嚴密的診察，方能知道到底由於牙齒本身的疾病，或是牙齒周圍組織的疾病，或是其他疾病所致。什麼原因，用什麼方法，才能收効。就是講到對症療法，也是因症而異，或應外塗，或應內服，或應採用其他方法，自己也不容易决定的。</p>
<p>（第一八七問）　一時找不到牙醫生時，自己有什麼權宜方法可以應用嗎？</p>
<p>答　劇烈的牙痛，確是人人所怕的。如一時不能得到牙醫生的治療而又痛得難忍時，自不得不先想法子去緩和疼痛。局部的方法，可用冷水常常含漱。又水內加些酒精，冲注口腔內部，亦大有効。或用薄荷二克，酒精及依打各二十四西西，哥羅鑼仿九十西西混和，用力磨擦疼痛部分。其餘如溫水浴和溫水浸足等，亦能减輕痛苦。至於內服藥，凡藥房所售的現成止痛藥片大概可靠，照仿單服用，不致有害。但旦不可因其有效而繼續常服，至有過量的危險。</p>
<p>（張一八八問）　很多市上所售的立止牙痛嗎？</p>
<p>答　這種藥水多係外用，也不過暫濟一時，决不能達到根治目的。而且並非各種牙痛皆效的。</p>
<p>（第一八九問）　牙痛劇烈不安眠時，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答　可服適量的安眠藥有益無害。大凡安眠藥多有止痛一舉兩得。</p>
<p>（第一九〇問）　我國向來所用醫治牙痛方法，功效怎樣？</p>
<p>答　我國人向來對於牙患，很少眞切的認，以為一切牙痛，識多由於牙蟲作崇，或虛火上衝，或風邪蘊積所致，故治療方針，也就以捉牙蟲或是內服些驅風發散或淸火的藥為主。這些方法，都沒有什麼價値可言，捉牙蟲的荒謬，前面已經說過，至於發汗的藥，雖然本來有緩和疼痛的作用，但牙痛的眞正原因沒有徐去，還是無用的。</p>
<p>第六節　其他牙患的治療問題</p>
<p>（第一九一問）　什麼呌做埋伏齒？</p>
<p>答　凡潛藏在牙肉裏邊，還沒有生長出來的牙齒，都可以算做埋伏齒。</p>
<p>（第一九二問）　那隻埋伏齒最易發生病症？</p>
<p>傾向於　就是頂裏邊的盡頭牙，稱為第三大白齒，或呌智齒。本來應該在十八九歲長出來的，但牠和別只牙齒不同，往往不能按時長出？有時候埋藏着至三四十歲方出。還有一層，出的時候，往往作痛難出，發生很厲害的症象。</p>
<p>（第一九三問）　埋伏齒作痛難出，應該怎樣治療？</p>
<p>答　如果因為牙肉過厚，不易穿出，因之作痛不安，只消請牙醫生設法把牙肉割開，就易長出，痛苦立减。但如果因為埋伏齒的位置歪斜，或竟橫臥，因隣齒的阻隔，不能長出或不能完全長出時，則應早請牙醫生把埋伏齒拔去，否則不但痛苦不能停止，而且易發生重症。周圍組織，因刺激發炎，常致化膿，脹痛難忍，牽引頭面，牙關緊急，口不能張。這個時候，醫治困難，要等一二週炎症消退口能張大後；方可施治。然身體已經大受打擊，醫院靡得不堪了。</p>
<p>（第一九四問）　埋伏齒的拔除，為什麼較尋常牙齒為難？</p>
<p>答　因為牠一部份或是全部分埋藏在牙床骨裏，有時候要鑿開牙床骨，有時候還要把牙齒車為兩段，方能取出。所以手術很為麻煩，手術費也因之較尋常為多。</p>
<p>（第一九五問）　沒有蛀洞的咬合面，有時也會酸痛，應該怎樣治療？</p>
<p>答　凡咬合不正或是久受磨擦的牙齒，表面的牙磁，多半消耗，裏面帶黃色的旬牙質露出，故能感覺酸痛。治療方法，惟有把髓室車開，抽去牙髓，再行塡補，或是單把象牙質露出的部隊發車去塡補亦可。</p>

<h3>舉世公認之美容醫療劑</h3>
<p>— （滄石）</p>
<p>專治雀斑面皰　功能潔白皮膚　品精效宏—四時咸宜</p>
<p>夫美容品之多。至有不能悉舉其名。然而皆庸脂俗粉。充斥市廛。充其量。不過供一時塗抹。且夫一般劣質粉。含有多量之鉛質。損害皮膚孰甚。美容云乎哉。至若美容品而兼能療治雀斑面皰有特效者。更未之前聞。有之。其惟現在之「面麗」香膏乎。「面麗」為現代科學界之新發明。經多位藥師化騐研究而克成此美容醫療精品。以之治雀斑或面皰。有驚人之速效。四時常用。能使皮膚潔白細嫩。完全無刺戟或損害皮膚之弊。故故風行以來。舉世公認。誠有一搽「面麗」。三千粉黛無顏色之概矣。「面麗」。公司藥房均有售。價每瓶一元。</p>
<p>本市辣斐德路尹女士。自少卽患雀斑。至今日見增多。現當發育之際。面皰又纍纍發生。少女愛美。較人為甚。尹女士因常引此為痛心之事。多方求治無效。會其同學葉女士。吿以「面麗」能治此兩症。尹女士隨向中西藥房購得兩瓶。十餘日而面皰全愈。再一星期。雀斑亦漸去盡。尹女土歡欣無限。輒屢屢介紹於親友間云。</p>
<h3>疥癬</h3>
<p>— （賡白）</p>
<p>疥癩。（俗稱疥瘡）由一種疥癬蟲侵入人體皮膚中而發生。常穿孔於皮膚角質層下。或粘液層下。其孔道為不正之S形。蟲卽棲息其中。吾人手指與手指之皺襞間。尤為該蟲寄生最多之處。他如腕關節之屈曲面。肘關節之伸展曲。腋窩前面。陰部。乳房。股膝足蹠。臀部等處。皆為疥癬之好發部位。富有傳染性。其主要症狀。為皮膚發生小疹。或小水泡與小結節。發劇烈之瘙癢。夜間溫褥。其癢更甚。若以手指不絕搔爬。往往發生强烈之濕疹膿泡。到處蔓延傳佈。患者頗受其累。况疥癬之症。若早起即以適當方法治之。猶不難速愈。否則治療錯誤。或自然放任之。往往經久不治。延至數年或十數年不等。且家庭間之傳染。允不易避免。故治療實不容緩。「甘露藥水」。治癬瘡之功效最著。無論何種疥癬癲瘡濕氣等。祇需一滴。卽能止癢。且其殺蟲力極强。能直透皮膚角質層。而將其孔道中之疥蟲殲滅。實為最善之根本處置法矣。</p>
<p>（按「甘露」藥水。每瓶一元。上海永安先施公司西藥部。及本外埠各大藥房。均有經售。）</p>
<h3>淋毒性副睪丸炎</h3>
<p>— （良言）</p>
<p>在急性淋病。或慢性淋病的時期。突然感冒些風寒。身體發熱。同時陰囊的一邊。或左或右。漸漸覺得脹痛。其時體溫漸高。而覺頭痛胃呆。小便短少色赤。睪丸呈腫腸而下墜之勢。腫脹的睪丸。可大至二三倍以上。這是淋菌侵入睪丸之內。並不是疝氣症。趕快用專治淋毒性睪丸炎的方法去治療。那末可以少受許多痛苦。並且睪丸出過毛病的人。於生育上很發生妨碍。如其醫治得早。睪丸發炎的程度。沒有到極點。那子嗣問題。還不致於受影響。淋毒性的睪丸炎治療法。第一要打針。譬如白濁混合漿苗之類。第二須用電療。如短波透熱電療等。可以立則有止痛的功效。第三內服退熱及尿利等藥。第四用消腫膏或鉛糖水等塗布。並用提睪帶將睪丸束起。能够減少墜重及脹痛。上面所說的四種方法。是絕對治療淋毒性睪丸炎之良法。凡患此症者。照此治療。可以立起沉疴。</p>
<p>（編者按。淋病遷延日久。必致續發合併症。此淋毒性副睪丸炎。為合併症中。最多習見者。上海父子醫院有各種電療。醫治此症。不但症象迅速減退。並可使淋菌完全絕跡。故就治者。無不霍然云。）</p>
<h3>頑癬</h3>
<p>— （繼超）</p>
<p>本病之發生原因。犬率　　水汚垢。皮膚不潔之故。蓋皮膚由分泌浸潤之處。加以摩擦。至於濕潤軟化。則發生自易。其寄生物。為與一種寄生性匐行疹之寄生物相同。其性頑固難治。抵抗力甚堅强。故曰頑癬。本病發生之部位。多在於陰部及共周圍。往往由大腿內面而陰阜。而臍部。再由上而下。達于會陰部。臀部。薦骨部。成一大循環。此外如腋窩胸部等處。亦易于發生。本病進行極慢性。患處如地圖狀。邊際有鱗屑狀之濕疹。皮屑斑駁。性奇癢。然絕少傳染。且專生於男子。而其纏綿難治。至有亙數十年之久者。故治療頑癬。宜用良善而藥性正確之劑。邇來醫家頗多引用「甘露」藥水。竟得以屢奏奇效。蓋「甘露」俱强有力之殺菌功用。息者祇須每日連續搽四五次。無不指日痊愈。舍此別無更善方法也。</p>
<h3>謝（一）函</h3>
<p>— （本市王照寰）</p>
<p>鄙人患面　症。頭面上發生之够。較任何同病者為多。色初紅漸黑。幾如小兒之痧子。每以手指擠破之。而其瘰頭仍不退去。殊覺可厭。後屢見貴刋載面　症之洽法。始知「面麗」能治此症。曾向永安公司西藥部購得一瓶。屢屢用之。果十數日而完全吿愈。今面部皰瘰已夥粒無存。實貴刊之賜也。</p>
<h3>乾癬</h3>
<p>— （秋元）</p>
<p>乾癬。一名鱗屑癬。乃一種極慢性的神經性皮膚病也。本病之易發部位。為軀幹項部。四肢伸展面及頭髮部。而肘關節膝關節之伸展面允甚。經過緩慢。處置不得其當。往往延至晚年。病之初起。皮膚發出疹狀之斑點。或小結節。成不規則之圓形。色赤或褐。經過若干日後。表面生銀白色之鱗屑。若將鱗屑剝離。則膚面有小血點。入後周圍漸决擴大。若銅幣。若大銀幣。亦有紆迴曲折者。積久不治。有犯及全身者。其患處所被之鱗屑。有時中心化淡。有時則竟愈結而愈厚密。性亦瘙癢。乾癬之療法。有內服與注射塗佈等。然終不若用「甘露藥水」之外敷。為最簡易而有特效。普通患一部份之乾癬者。用「甘露」藥水之搽敷。恒不出一二星期即全治。</p>
<h3>好消息　男女淋病免費檢騐</h3>
<p>凡曾一度冶遊。或已染淋病者。雖服藥醫治。然是否業已斷根。病家每不易自知。往往淋病有假愈之狀態。一旦操勞。必再復發。故非加以騐尿不可。今上海法租界。寗波路父子醫院之嫌疑。可逕往檢騐。是否尙有餘毒。立刻可得報吿。完全義務。不收騐費。</p>
<h3>黃癬</h3>
<p>— （雲生）</p>
<p>黃癬。為一種寄生之運瑣形絲狀芽胞菌體。有頭皮黃癬。毳毛黃癬。爪甲黃癬之分。頭皮黃癬。即俗稱鬁鬁頭是也。本病之寄生菌。不特人與人之間有傳染性。而人與鷄鼠犬貓家兎等。亦能互相傳染。大都侵犯于頭皮毛囊周圍者為多。毳毛部上爪甲中較少。患處以形成黃癬菌甲為其特色。所謂　　菌甲者。係黃癬菌之純粹聚落。在毛幹之周圍。作成硬固之硫黃色乾痂。有時放一種異臭。毛髮于是失其光澤。日久則息部毛髮盡落。皮膚漸漸萎縮。殆如赤秃。發于毳毛部者。甚輕微。因毳毛之毛根不達于皮膚深部故也。發于爪甲上者。爪甲部肥厚而起黃色斑點。幷若犯及手指。黃癬久久不治。則患處起皮膚乳嘴萎縮。永不復生毛髪。故應早求適當之治療。法用「甘露」藥水較厚塗佈。使其結痂處之黃癬菌甲脫落。續用「甘露」搽數日後。即能根本痊愈而毛髮重生也。</p>
<h3>女子白帶之應急自療法</h3>
<p>— （祖扆）</p>
<p>白帶症者。概言之。婦女生殖器之病症也。其發生本症病態之部。不外子宮與卵巢。其發生之原因。最多為受白濁菌之傳染。或寄生蹺蟲與雜菌。輕者妨害健康。重者促壽絕嗣。其應急自療方法。可購「內服白帶丸」與「外用白帶藥」。內外相輔而治。靈效無比。該兩藥每種每盒各售二元。上海法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院總經售。外埠郵購加寄費二角。</p>
<h3>陰癬</h3>
<p>— （壽臣）</p>
<p>陰癬。多發生於而股皮膚相對而易摩擦之部。蓋一種慢性絲狀菌症也。本病之病原菌。為小芽胞菌。其形織小。不過及癜風菌之三分之一。集合如密網。本菌專蕃殖於有特異質之角層細胞間。故主發生於陰胯部。更向其附近蔓延。息處為淡紅色或成暗褐色之圓形斑狀。共周圍與健康部有明顯之界限。自覺的症狀。唯為瘙癢。發汗時允甚。本症在我國男子。患之者最多。且能傳染于他人。若天氣稍熱。發汗較多。則更覺可厭。本病之治療。在洗澡後。用「甘露藥水」連續塗搽患處。有出人意料之速效。且能斷根而不再發。甘露每瓶一元。各大藥房均有經售。</p>
<h3>遺精症</h3>
<p>— （仙霞）</p>
<p>遺精為男子特有之病症。自發育時期以迄衰老。皆有患之。而未婚少年之患此者允多。原因於少年時期之自凟。中年時期之縱慾。以及後天衰弱等。隨遺精症而續發者。為神經衰弱。腦力精神。日趨萎靡。體力性慾。日見衰減。為害之大。不讓於肺癆等症也。上海法大馬路西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社發行之「喜汝康」丸。每瓶售洋二元。為冶遺精症之特效劑。其主要成分。不僅在能固精。更佐以健腦强身之劑。故服後神經衰弱之症象。無不隨遺精而俱愈。若常服之。則對于身體之補力。有偉大之收獲也。</p>
<h3>謝（二）函</h3>
<p>— （袁美珍）</p>
<p>不久以前。承蒙貴刋醫藥顧問處的指導。將治雀斑的方法詳細吿我。就在本埠同仁西藥社買了一瓶治此症的「面麗」香膏。回來後就依法開始搽用。大約經過半瓶後。漸漸見效。心裏欣幸的了不得。後來又在五洲藥房續購二瓶。結果。果然把面上抱恨了多年的雀斑除去了。我的同學和親戚們。很多有息此症的。極願廣為介紹。但因在暑期裏。不能一一去吿訴。希望將此信在貴刋公佈。那末獲益的當不僅我的親友了。</p>
<h3>醫藥簡訊</h3>
<p>— （記者）</p>
<p>胃病之症。不特為非常痛苦之疾病。且與人生身體營養及健康。均有莫大之關係。故胃痛不宜忽視。而胃臟一旦罹病。允亟宜醫治也。本埠法大馬路西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁再藥社出品之「胃必靈」。治胃病素稱有效。治胃痛更有神騐。不論胃部多酸脹悶。嘔吐噯氣。消化不良。食慾不振等症。數服即愈。在新藥雲湧中。而欲求善良之胃病藥者。我敢斷其除「胃必靈」外。鮮有可與之比擬者矣。「胃必靈」每盒售一元。藥房均有經售。</p>
<p>都市愈繁華。花柳病之產生亦愈多。此一定不易之理也。上海為花柳病蕃殖之區域。而治療花柳病之方法。亦日新月異。電氣治療之於花柳淋病。為無上之唯一妙法。本埠法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院。內部設備非常完善。電療一項。有十餘種之多。對于男女淋病。更有獨到之經騐。聘有專門醫師。主持診務。病房設備。尤為寬暢整潔。至於取費之廉。更屬難能云。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>拿什麽去歸告國人？</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日國聯開會，阿皇蒞會，作沈痛的演說，其初痛陳意國的殘忍，與責備國聯的無能，其結語謂，我將拿什麽報吿國人？聽者莫不擊掌，慨歟，頗引起一般的同情，但是阿國到底亡了，卽此次所提出的募債提案，亦全遭否决，以後再欲在國聯大會中，說幾句話的機會，恐亦不可得矣，據五日巴黎電稱，瑞士聯邦政治部長穆達，業已通告阿皇，謂國聯大會結束工作後，應請於二十四水時內，離開國境，巴黎迥聲報記者貝爾蒂那，亦自日內瓦發出同樣消息，亡國之君，到處受人家賤視，到處受人家恥辱，至於如此，若亡國之民，正不知受人家怎樣虐待。</p>
<p>阿國亡了，以後還能彀恢復舊業與吾，這問題且撇開不提，我再來談談國聯，阿國亡了，國聯也可說隨之而亡，國聯的名雖未亡，而其實則等於亡也，試看阿代表前日在國聯會中宣讀宣言書，曰「國聯會其將撇棄被侵略國，聽其受侵略國之宰割歟？國聯大會於去年十月十日，通過决議案，宣佈意大利之罪狀而判為侵略國鐵案如山，莫可動搖，試問今茲决議案，是否與前决决議案相符合歟？」此種語調，在國聯會員國的會員聞之，何等刺心，何等難過。</p>
<p>前日期博士迭次在獨立評論上發表，謂國聯還可以抬頭，我不知國聯的頭，如何抬法，這眞是博士的高見，而非博士所能夢想矣，自九一八事件發生後，國聯已為人看穿，謂其等於紙糊老虎，此决意阿戰事發生，更為人看穿，謂其似古刹中的泥神。幷且國聯自經兩次失敗以後，困難問題的襲擊正多，卽如擺在目前的但澤問題恐不久卽要和國聯絕綠，德奧的合併問題，地中海的覇權問題更將逐步而起，一一要重勞國聯會員國的焦慮，這原是無可逃避的事實。</p>
<p>國聯的本身，也感覺到應付各種環境的失敗，與不易，於是欲望將國聯會改組，或想加强國聯的力量，我說這多是廢話，若欲改組國聯，原是可以，但亦是換湯不換藥，若欲加强國聯力量，或可俟諸二次大戰以後，此何以故？國聯會的組織，嘲笑之者謂為是一個分贓機關，其實國聯安足以當此者，若能分贓得法，則現在國際間的紛亂，便不致發生，其實國聯的失敗，亦是英法的失敗，英法為國聯會員國的主要份子，因為現在野心的國家，莫不雄心勃發，鑑於英法能力之薄弱，而利害的不一致，於是欲崛起而改造一新局面，故歐洲局勢的混亂，正是方興而未艾也。</p>
<p>欲推翻舊局面重造新勢力主角為何？則德意是也，據五日羅馬電訊，謂意國航空部决長伐萊將軍，於上月二十六日，與德國當局，簽訂航空協定，該協定有效期間，定為十年，於經濟政治上均含有重大意義於兩國中，任何一國，搗亂現局，國聯已難應付，德意兩國，若結聯一氣，英法等國，實可寒心，均在今日局勢之下，不獨何國抱淪亡之痛，繼阿國而遭强暴所汚者，正不多凡幾也，阿皇其亦可自慰矣。</p>
<h3>一家</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>傍晚了，野裏騰起稀薄的，無力而衰弱的炊烟，狗在遠處疏落地，一聲兩聲地吠着，蚊子嗡嗡地，依舊像十年，二十年前那麽地在流着臭汗的人們底四週亂飛，打着旋，吮去了人們底血，很少有一兩家人家，依舊像三五年前一樣地，把矮矮的篠凳搬到塲上來吃水泡飯，男的把臉子喝得通紅，孩子們被大人底粗聲氣與蚊虫底可咬擾得驚慌而難受，便雜亂地，無休止地哭了起來—在夏天，也許僅僅從這一些「難得」的片斷上面，才能找出這鄉村依然是舊日的一個，這土地也並不是新的，陌生的，不祥的；然而，這些年來，一切都變得悽凉而荒寂了，年頭一年年地壞起來，這土地上的人們，不能再安然地勞作着，繁息着了，他們有的在監獄裏，有的渺茫地失落在遠處（也許，便永久地失落在另一個世界裏了），有的流浪在陌生的「繁榮」的都會的碼頭上……一切都換了一付樣子，怨恨與咀咒使人忘懷了一些本能的情感，可怕的，發酵的生活把人全部地改造—毁壞了。</p>
<p>長庚婆婆就首先對着這「改變了」的世界駭怕着的：自己已經近八十了，除了求得一個「善終」以外，對這些日子是什麽也不想了。然而，荒凉，殘酷與衰落，從外面的世界襲擊到了那些小小的，每一個角落裏：就連八十歲上的長庚婆婆，也曾被可怕的惡夢驚醒過好多决了，眼跳，心跳，據她想，那可並不是一個「好兆」啊。一個守了三十年活寡撫養起來的兒子，去年就沒有田做了：上城裏去給人家挑磚瓦，掙十二個銅子一天的事，幹了二個月，身子一天天地乾苦而瘦弱起來，走路說話，氣祗是不停地喘，那樣，有個把月的光景，城裏的磚瓦鋪子裏嫌他做不來多少工，便硬生硬氣地把他歇掉了。長庚哭着，下了跪，可是沒有用，回來是終於回來了，可是在床上睡了二天，第三天早上，他吐了許多膩疾，拿到外面一看，全都腥紅的，凝結起來的可怕的血塊……</p>
<p>於是，一切都來到了那生活之書的最後的一章：而這一章，長庚婆婆是用了八十歲的衰老的心，費力地讀完了它！一切幾十年來的辛勞與苦惱，現在只是等於在賭博中作了有意的孤注一擲，而且，她是輸定的了！因為，三個月之後，他們就來到了不可避免的一天：再也找不出過日子的路來了。家裏斷了糧，可當可賣咳嗽，吐血；而年輕的長庚娘子，則怨恨地丟下了三個未滿十歲的孩子，跟人走到上海「帮人家」（註：去做女傭的意思）去了。她覺得在那「癆計鬼」身上是再也找不出安逸的日子來的，因之，决定要用她底年靑向那沒落的大城市裏去試一試愚蠢的「命運」看。</p>
<p>那麽凄凉的日子延讀了三天，長庚在一個夜裏突然地在哭起來，接着，到天亮的時候，他悄悄地把三個孩子拋到了石橋頭的那口井裏去，回來，看看睡熟着的長庚婆婆，又跪下來悄悄地向她叩了一個頭，自己便也用一根繩子掛在樑上了……</p>
<p>一切都變了，可是一切也便是舊日的世界哪！而今，日子却趣得那麽可怕，這些殘酷與無情是不知從那兒來的。這是長庚婆婆和她同時代的人都想不到的，而更想不到的，却還得說是長庚婆婆自己，她「修好」了一世，吃了一世的苦，却連求一個「好死」都辦不到，她自己與別人都不會相信的，八十歲的人，還得死在繩上，死在水裏，送了兒孫們的終……</p>
<p>長庚婆婆終於是死在繩上的，她曾為舊日的世界而號哭，可是，這世界已終究不是舊日的那一個了……</p>
<h3>一塲小風波</h3>
<p>— 巳而</p>
<p>老板的大婦一早到晚總高興駡人，今天更其駡得起勁。她駡人的話是千篇一律的：「妖精！淫婦！一個月伴男人睡五夜還不足。討你進門是要做娘姨用</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>的，我這般對待你，算是格外地客氣了，你却還不識好歹，事事想占上風！難道你眞非把我迫走不成？……」可是今日她發脾氣，却添加了不少新鮮的駡語：</p>
<p>「希罕！希罕！虧得你有本領會養一個孩子出來！」</p>
<p>小老婆坐在床上，解開胸襟，抱着孩子在餵奶。老板倚在床邊，手里拿着一隻小茶杯，在那里攪什麽似的。他聽到了老婆的呌駡聲，雙眉一蹙，慢慢地抬起頭來望了一望站在房門口怒目而視的她，低氣下心地說？</p>
<p>「算了吧！不要這樣鬧了。孩子又是你喜歡的。討她進來，就希望能早得一個孩子，來繼承我們王家的嗣，現今總算如願了。况討她也是你做主意的，是不是？」</p>
<p>「誰喜歡她的孩子！誰和你們吵駡！難道我說她幾句你就耐不住了嗎？是的，孩子是你們的心肝寳貝，我就偏不希罕他！養孩子，我沒有給你們王家養了三個孩子嗎？」大婦用一隻指頭向老板一指。</p>
<p>「是呵，你是養了三個的，可惜現在一個個都……不然，我們怎麽會再討她進來呢？」</p>
<p>「一個個都死掉了！誰呌你們王家就這樣沒福居子！你還好說？」她頓了頓足。</p>
<p>「沒福居子？如今不是托上天庇佑，又得了一個了嗎？所以我勸你還是大量一點，好好來看顧這個孩子。」他把小茶杯放在桌上，就向床沿坐了下去，轉過身去瞧望正在吮奶的孩子，問小老婆：「不是吃够了嗎？」</p>
<p>「……」小老婆沒有做聲，只把頭一偏表示着不耐煩的樣子。</p>
<p>「呱！呱！呱！」孩子在小老婆的懷里哭了。</p>
<p>「你看她越來越驕傲了，這個妖精！有辰光我也是呌她不要把孩子餵得太飽了，她總是不理人。」大婦用眼瞪着小老婆。</p>
<p>「你旣不喜歡孩子，却又偏要來管人家飽不飽？」小老婆這時也回話了。</p>
<p>「嚇！你這個淫婦！你現在目中沒人了，敢這般大膽和我鬥口！孩子眞的就是你的了嗎？吿訴你：這一個孩子雖說是你養出來的，却是王家的種。你養他，不過是借你的肚子出世吧了，他將來還不是我的後嗣嗎」大婦給小老婆的話激得忍不住了，一邊大聲地罵，一邊把袖口一捲，大踏步地走近床前，從小老婆的懷里把孩子奪了過去，怒氣冲冲地向外邊跑：「你不要我管，我却偏要來管，看你怎麼樣！」</p>
<p>小老婆氣倒在床上，老板只呆望着天花板。</p>
<p>「呱！呱！呱」遠遠地還送來了一陣孩子的哭聲。</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>那聲音，激揚而又凄厲，尤其是在又靜又冷的冬的夜里。冷冷的燈光灑在雪上，印在雪上的人影是又龐大的糢糊。可是他們一步一步地邁着。他們的手掌為什麽紅腫？他們為什麽要渾身震顫？他們為什麽不要家，夜的家的溫暖？</p>
<p>「得了吧，賣給你。再走了兩條胡同就家去了，這樣冷的天氣」。他們說着，嘴里噓着一股股熱氣。我曉得他們也是愛家的，但他們却不能不在積着厚雪的路上走着，你說他們忙着什麽？他們為着什麼呢？</p>
<p>早上，也許雪還是下若，躺在溫暖的被窩里的人，這正是一個最適於遐想的時候。但門外却有着咿咿哎哎的水車聲，山東漢子推着水車來了。不用問是什麽樣的天氣，車子渾身正結着堅硬的泳。他這車水漢子却從身上拿下跌鈎，套上水桶後便把水挑進來。也許那時候天還沒大亮，但他却要挑着挑着，一直挑到黃昏。他們不疲倦。他們不厭煩？他們為什麼緊感着雙眉，像有無限的隱痛的樣子？</p>
<p>從我房里的玻瑙窗望過去，前面是一片廣塲，有許多人在那里忙着樹樑，有許多人在那里忙着搬運沙土。有許多人正在站在高高的頂脊上挑着瓦片。遠遠望過去，他們小得像猴子一般。我時常因此想起小孩時候在鄉里觀過的猴戲，猴子穿着紅袍，戴着假面，在一支高高的竹捍上打轉。要是來一陣在風，他會不會給刮下來。泥水匠們整天地忙着。也許他們見過捧下來的同伴們，在無望他抽搐着，甚至還見過灰白色的腦髓。但他們還得爬上去。誰道他們設想到自己的性命，自己的妻兒？</p>
<p>他們統是為着什麼呢？你問他們，他們準答你說不知道。他們却一天天地打煞一下去，直到一點也不動彈以時候，才撒開手，把人生的入門券交給上帝。</p>
<p>生活是這樣的麽？為什麼要麼樣活下去呢？</p>
<h3>枇杷</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>在都市上枇杷大概早已上市了吧？可是在鄉下此刻正是枇杷剛熟的時候。</p>
<p>多年混在都市上，暢快地吃枇杷只是一件同憶的事罷了。今年在鄉下，在下春雪的時侯，家人曾特地喊夥計到枇杷院裏去搖枇杷樹上的春雪，且說今年的枇杷恐怕不及去年了，因為屢下春雪，對於枇杷是有損害的。我暗暗地想，這也算命運吧，我在鄉下了，而春雪偏下得這麼大。</p>
<p>最近接倒家信，說枇杷已轉黃了，這次無論如何要我回去。於是在校中託事請了三天假，在長途汽車上坐了兩個鐘頭便跨進自已的家門。父親一見我的面就說：「枇杷雖不及去年那麽好，但也不十分壞，這好在夥計搖春雪呀。」我坐着，還沒喝完一杯茶，，夥計已將很多的枇杷放在桌子上了。我用着十餘年前的熟練的手法撕去了皮一口呑下，隨卽將核子一顆兩顆吞下來。呑着，呑着，直到肚子有些脹了纔停止。</p>
<p>吃了中飯，一覺醒來，太陽已打斜得很厲害了。開了後窗向枇杷院裏一望，只見纍纍的金黃色的枇杷像滿天的星子，在墨綠色的葉叢中有難以言諭的美麗。我想，要嘗眞滋味非上樹親自採來吃不可，於是不聲不響的帶上了後門，到枇杷院爬上枇杷樹去。究竟多年沒有爬樹了，所以很容易爬的枇杷樹我也有些害怕了。我小心攀住了椏枝，站穩了脚，又攀住了椏枝，移動了脚，這樣好多回，纔站到頂上，我從墨綠色的葉叢中冒起頭來居高臨下地看着纍纍的金黃色的枇杷。我倚靠在樹上揀顏色最金黃的摘下一顆，依舊用着十餘年前的熟練的手法撕去了皮一口吞下，隨卽將核子一顆兩顆吐下來。這核子悉悉索索的在無數的枝葉上碰撞了幾下，逗留了幾下，滑跌了幾下，終於秃的一聲滾在地上了。</p>
<p>在院裏，枇杷有兩種，一種是紅沙一種是白沙。紅沙枇杷的皮肉爛紅色的，味道只是甜，白沙枇杷的皮肉是淡黃色的，味道比紅沙枇杷來得鮮美。說得更確切一點，紅沙枇杷的滋味是爛紅糖的滋味，而白沙枇杷的滋味乃是賽雪白糖的滋味。</p>
<p>我從紅沙枇把樹上又爬到白沙枇杷樹上，呑了一顆又一顆，終於再也吞不下了。住在都市上的人儘可吃到有名的洞庭山上的枇杷，但親自站在樹上，親自摘一顆吃一顆的風味是不會頒略到。</p>
<p>我是一個倦遊歸來的旅人，所以除解散了對枇杷的想思之外還有着濃重的傷感。雖不至「舊物摩挲淚幾行」，但一種沉鬱的懷舊之情已足够揉碎我脆弱的感情。回想十餘年前做孩子的時候為了怕祖母的責駡，在黃昏，在深夜，偸偸地爬上樹去偸枇杷的事情已如一個遠年的夢糢糊而又褪色，除了留下一團不可從摸的悲哀似乎再沒有什麽了。</p>
<p>斜陽裏，在敗落的院子裏只有枇杷樹訴說着古老的往事。如今祖母死了，母親死了，弟妹死了只一個年老的父親看守着枇杷樹，枇杷樹大概也要感到孤零了吧？</p>
<p>在家勾留了三天，現在又來到校中埋首在課港裏了。像別了一個久別重逢的友人，如今我在懷念着枇把樹。願它</p>

<p>Original Text of the Proposal by Tang Shaoyi and Others</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Committee Member Tang Shaoyi and 31 other committee members proposed to issue an order to abolish the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and that comrades in the Southwest who guide Party affairs and politics should be concentrated in the Central Government to jointly take responsibility. The proposal has been passed by the General Assembly. The original text of the proposal is as follows: It is proposed that in view of the recent mobilization of troops by Guangdong and Guangxi generals under the pretext of requesting to fight against Japan, regardless of their internal motives, from an objective point of view, it is a behavior that disperses national spirit, shakes the government's position, and weakens national strength. It is called defending against insults, but it actually invites insults. It is called saving the country, but it is actually destroying the country. What could be more tragic than this? It is found that the arrogant behavior of the Guangdong and Guangxi generals in recent years has been based on the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, which are like separate governments that confront the Central Government. Not only are they independent in employing personnel and administering government, but even in diplomacy, they advocate their own positions and publicize them internationally. In military and political affairs, they arbitrarily change unit numbers and establish their own banners. Have they ever thought that in today's country, how can there be foreign resistance without national unity and internal solidarity? The Southwest Executive Department is originally subordinate to the Central Party Headquarters, and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee is originally subordinate to the National Government. Now, they have forgotten their original purpose and have been held hostage by a small number of military personnel as tools to oppose the Central Government and establish their own separatist rule. Moreover, in practice, many comrades who were originally responsible for the two agencies have left in dismay because they were unwilling to be puppets, and those who have remained have often watched the rampant behavior and sighed helplessly. Today, in order to seek consistent resistance against insults, it is necessary to strengthen the government's strength and unify national political orders. These two agencies are no longer necessary to be established. Now, on the occasion of the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth National Congress of our Party, based on the above-mentioned opinions, it is proposed to issue an order to abolish the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and that comrades who were originally in the Southwest to guide Party affairs and politics should be concentrated in the Central Government to jointly take responsibility, so that the internal unity of the country can be realized from now on and a unified organization can be completed. Then, it will be truly helpful to resist the enemy and defend against insults. Is it appropriate? We respectfully request a public decision. Proposers: Tang Shaoyi, Sun Ke, Chen Shuren, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Liu Weichi, Zhang Fakui, Chen Ce, Huang Musong, Chen Qingyun, Luo Yiqun, Liang Hancao, Chen Gongbo, Zeng Yangfu, Deng Jiayan, Zhou Qigang, Fu Bingchang, Lin Die, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Xie Zuomin, Yu Junxian, Hu Wencan, Xu Chongzhi, Xiao Jishan, Huang Shaoxiong, Gan Naiguang, Cheng Tiangu, Zheng Zhannan, Li Fulin, Yang Yongtai.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Report: The Steps and Limits of Saving the Nation and Resisting Insults; Recent Diplomatic Avenues Have Not Reached the Final Juncture; Organize a National Defense Conference to Jointly Take Responsibility for Resisting Foreign Insults</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee finished discussing the proposals on the 13th, Chairman Chiang reported to the General Assembly on the significance of the Presidium's proposal to organize a National Defense Conference. The original words are recorded as follows: "Comrades, the several proposals discussed by the General Assembly today are all very important, especially those concerning the Southwest. The 'Minimum Policy for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation at Present' proposed by Comrade Xiao Focheng and others is particularly important, because the Review Committee, after careful consideration, believes that there is no need for another resolution. Now that the agenda is over, I, on behalf of the Presidium, would like to report a few words on this case. The proposals of the comrades stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, the points raised in their content, can be said to be very important. Our Plenary Session also attaches great importance to this case. However, since the Fifth National Congress was held last year, the Central Government has been working hard on the work of saving the nation almost every moment, and it has also been working hard on the work of saving the nation almost every moment. Today, the General Assembly's resolution that there is no need for another resolution is partly because the procedures of the proposal itself are not complete, and partly because the comrades in the Southwest have been too isolated from the Central Government in the past few years and do not fully understand the situation of the Central Government, so there is this proposal. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to fully explain. When we are facing this serious national crisis, we should not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves to resist insults and save the nation. This is not only the mentality of our Central Committee members, but even the elementary school students across the country are constantly thinking about this sentence. It can be said that all Chinese people know that they want to save the nation and that they want to resist insults. However, what steps should be taken to resist insults and save the nation? The most important thing is to set a clear limit as the standard for deciding national policy. This minimum limit is what was decided at last year's National Congress: 'We will never give up peace until the time of complete hopelessness, and we will not lightly talk about sacrifice until the time of the final juncture.' These few words may not be clear to the people in Guangdong and Guangxi. How is it considered the minimum limit that we must not give up peace? How is it considered the final juncture? This is where many of our comrades who do not come to the Central Government do not understand the Central Government's policy. Now, I will explain the meaning of these resolutions again, that is, the explanation of the so-called minimum limit, clearly, and I hope that all comrades, especially the comrades from Guangdong and Guangxi, will pay special attention to it so that they can convey the Central Government's minimum limit for diplomacy back to their posts, bearing the meaning of the Central Government. That is to maintain the integrity of territorial sovereignty. We absolutely cannot tolerate any country coming to infringe on our territorial sovereignty. We will never enter into any agreement that infringes on our territorial sovereignty, and we will absolutely not tolerate any facts that infringe on our territorial sovereignty. To put it more clearly, if someone forces us to sign an agreement that damages territorial sovereignty, such as recognizing a puppet state, that is when we cannot tolerate it, and that is when we make our final sacrifice. This is one point. Since the National Congress in November of last year, if we encounter any further infringement of territorial sovereignty, if we exhaust all political and diplomatic means and still cannot eliminate this infringement, that is, if it endangers the fundamental survival of our nation, this is when we cannot tolerate it. At that time, we will definitely make the final sacrifice. So-called our minimum limit, that is it. However, in the past six months, the diplomatic situation, everyone believes, has not reached a time of hopelessness of peace. Rather than saying that peace is hopeless, it is better to say that the situation in the past six months is even more hopeful than before. I dare say that recent diplomatic avenues have not reached the final juncture. This is something that can be clearly reported to all comrades. The diplomatic situation is even more complex now. I remember that the Abyssinian War had just broken out, and the outcome could not be determined. The world naturally sympathized with Abyssinia. Unfortunately, Abyssinia has now failed. However, we cannot say that because Abyssinia has failed, we cannot be the second Abyssinia. We want to save the country from danger and maintain the survival of the nation. We are not afraid to be Abyssinia. Although we are not afraid to be Abyssinia, we are not willing to be Abyssinia. If all the compatriots and comrades of the whole country can uniformly obey the command of the Central Government, China will never be Abyssinia. At the juncture of the life and death of the nation, all handling and decisions must be especially cautious. We must not act rashly and plunge the nation into a state of eternal destruction. Now, Abyssinia has been destroyed. On the one hand, we see the spirit of Abyssinia, and we naturally sympathize with it, but at the same time, we think of the humiliation and suffering suffered by the people of Abyssinia under the empty international judgment, which is truly unbearable to hear. Now, the great power of the life and death of our China can be said to be in the hands of our party, especially all the Central Committee members, who must bear this responsibility. Is it true that we are taking a dead end when peace is not hopeless? Is it true that we want to make the country perish when it can avoid perishing? Is it true that we want to gamble everything on a whim or in the hope of personal glory and completely bury the future of the nation? At this time, if our party comrades are truly loyal and patriotic, I don't think they will do this. We know very well that the comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi, especially the armed comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi, are not aware of the relationship between diplomacy and military affairs, and they do not understand the Central Government's policies and preparations, resulting in various past misunderstandings and erroneous actions. Today, the main significance of the Presidium's proposal to organize a National Defense Conference is that it is hoped that the military authorities of various regions can unanimously come to the Central Government to participate in the discussion, and everyone can thoroughly understand the various resolutions and measures. Once an incident occurs, we can also unite and jointly take responsibility for resisting foreign insults. Therefore, although the proposals of the comrades now stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi are not complete in procedure and cannot be established due to factual estrangement, the Presidium's proposal is sufficient to express a considerable opinion on their proposal, and it can be promoted in a unified manner, which can also implement the hopes of the compatriots and comrades of the whole country. This is some explanation from this seat at the end of today's meeting for the Presidium's proposal and the painstaking efforts of the comrades present. I hope that all comrades, especially the comrades from Guangdong and Guangxi, will pay attention to it and convey it to the comrades who have not attended, so that they can understand it uniformly.

<h3>Li Han-hun Replies to Tang Shao-yi and Others</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Shao-yi and 28 other Central Committee members from Guangdong in Beijing recently sent a telegram to Li Han-hun to express their deep condolences. On the 12th, they received a reply from Li, saying, "Mr. Sun Zhesheng relayed to Mr. Tang Shaochuan, and to all the gentlemen of the Central Committee. Having read your respectful telegram, your praise and encouragement are greatly appreciated. Apart from feeling ashamed, I am indescribably excited. I am informed that the General Assembly will resolve national affairs appropriately, and that the unification of resistance to insults is imminent. The good news has been conveyed, and I am deeply gratified. Han-hun is unworthy, but if it is beneficial to the Party and the country, I will not dare to cherish this hair and skin. Gentlemen lead the masses and cherish their hometowns. Looking north at the clouds, my spirit travels with you. Great plans and loyal advice are awaited. Li Han-hun, Wen." (Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yun Lie, a revolutionary pioneer, a friend of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, recently sent a telegram to Chairman Lin Sen, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and all the Central Committee members attending the Plenary Session, requesting them to stop the disturbances in Guangdong and Guangxi in order to relieve the suffering of the people. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Comrade Lin Zichao and Comrade Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, and to all comrades of the Second Plenary Session: The national crisis is urgent, and there is no way to resist insults without unity. The people's livelihood is declining, and there is no way to alleviate the suffering without ending the disputes. To unify political orders and concentrate power and ability in the central authorities, so as to make the steps consistent and to make orderly efforts, is the most urgent plan at present. Lie followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to initiate the revolution, originally hoping to revive the Chinese nation and revitalize our country. Now that the revolution has succeeded, we are planning to build. How can we allow two or three upstarts who are unwilling to do so to gamble everything on a single throw of the dice? I hope that all comrades will quickly stop them, so that the masses will not suffer again. Then, the old man in the wild will be able to see the martyrs in the afterlife and smile without regret. Yun Lie kowtows, Wen." (Central News Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3>A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Current Situation in Central Europe</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The failure of the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy represents a significant blow to the collective security system and the forces of peace. When the forces of "righteousness" suffer setbacks, the shadow of "evil" naturally grows larger. The recent compromise between Germany and Austria, and the formation of the German-Italian bloc, are clear examples of this. Germany and Austria, two Germanic nations with the same language and culture, had been largely incompatible in recent years. However, on the evening of the 11th, the two countries suddenly announced a friendly agreement. Germany recognized Austria's full sovereignty, and the two countries agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs, declaring that this was entirely consistent with the spirit of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian agreement. The Austrian cabinet was reorganized accordingly, appointing the well-known pro-German Hürth as a minister without portfolio and Schmidt as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. After this agreement was established, not only would the past disputes between Germany and Austria temporarily cease, but its impact on Central Europe and the entire European political situation would be very significant.</p>
<p>Why have Germany and Austria, once incompatible, suddenly reached a compromise? To explain this, we must examine the past relations between the two countries and the international situation in Central Europe. Germany and Austria are Germanic nations with the same language and culture. After the Great War, there was a strong tendency for the two countries to merge. The German-Austrian Customs Union of 1931 was the initial implementation of this plan. However, the merger of Germany and Austria would significantly harm the interests of the Allied Powers, especially France's hegemony in Europe. Therefore, they vehemently opposed Austria's annexation by Germany. The Treaty of Saint-Germain included a provision prohibiting the merger of Germany and Austria. After the Nazi Party came to power, Hitler's annexation movement intensified. However, at this time, most of the Austrian people opposed merging with Germany, and Italy seized the opportunity to support Austria and oppose Germany's southward expansion policy. This was because if Germany annexed Austria, the borders of Italy and Germany would be connected, which would greatly hinder Mussolini's ambition to dominate Central Europe. Therefore, when the Nazi Party launched an armed coup in Vienna in July 1934, assassinating Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, Italy immediately deployed troops to the northern border, preparing to use force to counter Germany's annexation movement. Since then, Austria has been under the protection of the Blackshirt Prime Minister, opposing Hitler's southward expansion policy. However, after Italy launched its aggression in East Africa and was subjected to economic sanctions by the League of Nations, its international position became very isolated. Italy then turned to Germany and secretly courted them. Germany, having abandoned the Treaty of Versailles and actively expanded its military, sought to develop abroad, leading to encirclement by France, the Soviet Union, and the Little Entente. Therefore, it was naturally eager to join hands with its comrade in this aggression front. Although the League of Nations sanctions against Italy have been lifted and the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement has been abolished, the forces of the left-wing People's Front have greatly developed in Europe. Therefore, these two anti-socialist fascist "brothers in distress" have an even greater need to seek cooperation. The past grievances between Germany and Italy were concentrated on the Austrian question. Now, to seek cooperation, this issue must be resolved first. Fortunately, the Austrian government was "made" in Rome. Thus, through the mediation of the Blackshirt Prime Minister, the German-Austrian Friendly Agreement was simultaneously announced in the capitals of the two countries on the 11th.</p>
<p>Therefore, the compromise between Germany and Austria should not be seen merely as a simple matter between Germany and Austria, but rather as a matter between Germany and Italy, the preliminary condition for German-Italian collusion. We can see the collusion between Germany and Italy not only in the resolution of the Austrian question but also in the recent relations between the two countries. Let's cite a few important facts. On the 24th of last month, Italian Air Force Minister and Air Force Chief of Staff General Valle visited Berlin. On the 26th, he signed a commercial aviation agreement with Germany for a period of ten years. This agreement has significant economic and political implications, as it stipulates that both parties may operate routes between Rome and the North Sea and allows Germany to establish an airfield on one of the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands (in the eastern Aegean Sea). The former could cut across the routes operated by France and the Soviet Union, while the latter would allow Germany to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean. Two days later (June 28), Germany and Italy signed a commercial agreement to enhance their economic relations. More recently, the two countries reached an understanding: Germany recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and guaranteed Austria's independence, while Italy recognized Germany's eastward expansion and recovery of old colonies. The two countries also adopted a common attitude on all international issues. The scope of the collusion between Germany and Italy not only includes Austria but also extends to Hungary and Poland. Hungary, due to the signing of the Rome Protocols, had already fallen under Italy's sphere of influence. Poland, having signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany in 1934, had also joined Berlin's ranks. In this way, the "Central European Group" (Mittel Europa) advocated by Wilhelm II has emerged in the form of an aggressive bloc.</p>
<p>The main purpose of forming this aggressive bloc is naturally to counter the peace front led by France, the Soviet Union, and the Little Entente. With the formation of this bloc, Italy can dominate Central Europe and restore its important position before the East African war. As for Germany, it can escape its current international isolation and actively pursue its outward aggression policy for the Third Reich. Its main targets are eastward expansion and southward invasion of the Balkan Peninsula, and it also seeks to recover its old colonies. Therefore, the development of the forces of this aggressive front is a major blow to international peace and the collective security system. Its impact includes not only European countries but also the entire world. Although the strength of the peace front is greatly threatened, the forces of "righteousness" will ultimately overcome the forces of "evil," because peace is supported by the vast majority of people worldwide, while the policy of aggression is only actively supported by a small number of ambitious individuals.</p>

<h3>Yu Hanmou Left Nanjing Yesterday to Return to Defense, Rested Briefly in Nanchang and then Flew to Dageng</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed Guangdong Pacification Commissioner, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, and Commander of the First Army, Yu Hanmou, completed his business in Beijing and left Beijing by plane at 8:00 AM on the 13th with his Secretary-General Li Xuhuan, Chief of Staff Luo Zicai, and others to return to defense. Many party and government officials went to the airport to see him off. It is reported that Yu rested briefly after arriving in Nanchang and then changed planes to fly back to Dageng, which he is expected to reach in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Yu Hanmou left Beijing by plane at 8:00 AM on the 13th with his Secretary-General Li Xuhuan, Chief of Staff Luo Zicai, and others, and arrived in Nanchang at 10:00 AM. Party, government, and military officials Xiao Chunjin, Li Zhongxiang, Li Dezhao, Liu Jiashu, Liao Tuqiao, and others went to the airport to welcome him and hosted him for lunch at the Lixishe. After the meal, at the request of the members of the Lixishe, he personally wrote "Sincere Unity, Unite to Save the Country" as a souvenir. At 11:00 AM, he took another plane to return to Dayu. It is reported that he arrived in the afternoon. Before leaving, reporters asked him about his impressions of his visit to Beijing and his opinions on rectifying the situation in Guangdong. He said that the way out for China and the survival of the nation lies in sincere unity to save the country. This trip to Beijing was to promote national unity based on this idea. The changes in Guangdong and Guangxi are purely due to a very small number of people seeking temporary pleasure, deceiving the masses with coercive methods, and selling out their subordinates, making actions that do not match their words. In fact, the military and civilians of the two provinces deeply understand justice and all wish for national unity. Therefore, after arriving in Dayu, Yu and others will issue a circular telegram to the comrades in Guangdong, making a loyal and righteous appeal to save the country's crisis under the leadership of the central government. He believes that many people will be inspired by this. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central authorities and various Central Committee members from Guangdong are hopeful for the First Army Commander Yu Hanmou to rectify the situation in Guangdong. The various armies in Guangdong Province have also expressed their willingness to serve under Yu's command. On the 10th, Li Hanhun sent another telegram to Yu Hanmou and his comrades in Guangdong, requesting the central government to authorize Yu to rectify the chaos. Various Central Committee members from Guangdong, such as Sun Ke and Tang Shaoyi, also received Li Hanhun's telegram on the 12th. Central Committee member Luo Yiqun from Guangdong also telegraphed the commanders and deputy commanders of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armies of Guangdong Province, including Li Yangjing, asking them to persuade Chen Jitang to resign and hand over power to the central government, and to obey the order to have General Yu (Hanmou's courtesy name) be responsible for reorganizing the military affairs of the entire province, so that the disaster in Guangdong can be resolved immediately and national unity can be completed. The central government will definitely treat all officers and soldiers equally and keep them for future use. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The second general meeting on the 13th has resolved to have Yu Hanmou succeed as the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner and be responsible for reorganizing the military affairs of the entire province. Yu has agreed to serve the party and the country under the guidance of the central government and, urged by various parties, left Beijing by Savoya plane at 8:00 AM on the 12th with the director of the Li Management Office and the Chief of Staff to return to Guangdong to take office.

(Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Telegram from Dayu: Please inform all newspaper offices that we recently sent a telegram to the generals of Guangdong, saying that we have received a true telegram urging us to have our names listed in the telegram to retain Uncle Bo and not to rush to Beijing. Brothers, do you think this is the only way to care for Uncle Bo? We have shared hardships for a long time. How can we not care for Uncle Bo? In my opinion, this is an emergency, and there is no room for hesitation. Those who truly love Uncle Bo should ask Uncle Bo to immediately obey the orders of the central government and go to Beijing to share the heavy burden and work together to resist aggression. Frankly speaking, Guangdong and Guangxi are using the name of resisting Japan to provoke war. Everyone can see whether they have other intentions. We have been involved in secret affairs. How can we not know? When the狂潮轩起 broke out, the entire country went around mediating, but to no avail. General Yu felt the pain of the wall dispute and feared the disaster of national subjugation. Therefore, he did not avoid dangers and flew to Beijing on庚日 to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to work together for unity and save the crisis. The佳电 advocated obedience to the central government, cessation of disputes and resistance to aggression, and public loyalty to the country, which is obvious and inspiring to all who have blood. I believe that the national crisis has reached its final stage. It is still insufficient to resist aggression with the combined strength of the entire country. How can we煎萁豆 and藩篱自抉 and give the enemy the benefit of the fisherman? Only unity can resist aggression, and only resisting aggression can ensure survival. At present, there is no way to save the country other than obeying the central government and uniting. Uncle Bo has always been known for his merits and has been entrusted with heavy responsibilities. At this time of national crisis, he should put the central government first and one corner second, the country and the nation first and personal opinions second. If he can overcome all difficulties, release his troops and go to Beijing, then rumors will disappear, and his reputation will be high. His career and future are unlimited. If he still insists on his own opinions, it will inevitably lead to civil war. Not to mention the difference in strength, the morale is already depressed, and it is clear that people's hearts are trending. It is not necessary to await divination to know the outcome. Brothers, you are wise, how can you not know? If you bend to personal favors, it will only destroy our revolutionary group that has been around for many years. Even Uncle Bo will be ruined. The lesson of the 19th Route Army can be learned. How can those who love Uncle Bo bear to do this? Moreover, if this leads to national and ethnic catastrophe, how will we face our ancestors underground? In short, the situation is critical. We soldiers are supported by the country, and all our actions must be based on the interests of the country and the nation. Otherwise, we will not ask. All of you are outstanding people who know the times, love the country, and love your hometown. For the sake of saving the country and resisting aggression, I hope that you will unanimously urge Uncle Bo to go to Beijing on the designated date to assist the central government, so that the long-cherished ambition of leading the resistance against Japan can be fulfilled. Great situation is fortunate. Sincerely reply, waiting for your clear teaching. Li Zhenqiu, Mo Xide, Ye Zhao, Zhang Ruigui, Peng Linsheng, Deng Qichang, Zhong Fangjun, (stamped)</p>

<h3>Germany and Austria Restore Friendly Relations, Italian Diplomatic Victory, The Pre-War Triple Alliance Revived, The Stresa Front Dies Young</h3>
<p>Rome The Austro-German agreement is widely regarded as Mussolini's diplomatic victory. Several parties are now mutually questioning "Is this agreement a prelude to a new Italian-German agreement?" Well-informed sources here believe that the term "Stresa Front" will no longer be heard. There are even rumors that the pre-war Triple Alliance has been revived, and Italy is no longer in a secondary position as before. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin Political figures stated today that the Austro-German agreement accomplished what thousands of bombers and the Nazi Party's long-term terror campaign had failed to achieve. In other words, it is the two Germanic peoples standing side by side under the same roof. It is generally believed that Germany will use the prestige generated by the new agreement to gradually instill its ideology and policies into Austria. (National News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Austria's Foreign Policy Still Conforms to the Spirit of the Covenant, The Right to Independence Will Never Be Abandoned, A Step Further Towards Friendship with Germany, Adjusting Trade Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Vienna Responsible officials recently declared that the recent agreement between Austria and Germany was originally intended to restore normal relations between the two parties. It is quite surprising that foreign parties have misinterpreted it as Austria abandoning its right to independence or assuming that Austria's foreign policy is about to be controlled by Germany. It should be known that before Chancellor Schuschnigg announced this agreement yesterday, he said that Austria's foreign policy conformed to the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and was in harmony with the Rome Protocols of Italy, Austria, and Hungary. In short, if Austria wants to follow Germany's foreign policy, it should aim for Germany to abandon its imperialistic and territorial expansion desires. Austria should also promote political evolution through peaceful means. Although Austria considers itself a Germanic nation, it has never been hostile to Germany, even during the most intense disputes between the two parties, but it also does not want to be confused with it.

<p>Vienna Chancellor Schuschnigg stated to the Associated Press reporter today that although Austria has signed an agreement with Germany, it does not want to conclude military alliances with most countries. It is natural for Austria to practice friendship with Germany due to their common language and culture. However, Austria will remain completely independent and will continue to pursue a peaceful policy. As for the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy, there is no change, but this move is not intended to be realized by force. The idea of a referendum will also not be implemented if it is considered to affect European peace. (National News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Vienna Chancellor Schuschnigg announced today that all Nazi political prisoners will be released soon, except for those who have committed crimes that harm the lives and property of others. He also warned the Nazi Party that any actions that endanger the government will be prohibited. At the same time, Schuschnigg announced that Austria will soon negotiate a trade treaty with Germany and that Austria intends to retain its membership in the League of Nations and hopes that Italy will not withdraw either. In the future, Germany may trade coal from the Ruhr region for wood and milk from Austria. Obstacles to travel to the two countries will also be removed. As for the starting point of German-Austrian friendship, it actually began when the current German Ambassador to Austria, Papen, visited Austria in mid-October last year.

<h3>Exchange of Congratulatory Telegrams Between Austria and Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin - Today, Chancellor Hitler of Germany received the following telegram from Chancellor Schuschnigg of Austria:</p>
<p>"The establishment of an agreement to restore friendship and normal neighborly relations between Germany and Austria provides me with a great opportunity to extend my congratulations to Your Excellency. At the same time, it gives me the chance to express my confidence in this agreement. I firmly believe that the implementation of this agreement will not only benefit the two Germanic nation-states but also bestow blessings upon the entire Germanic people. I believe that Your Excellency shares my view that this agreement makes a significant contribution to European peace."</p>
<p>Hitler's reply was as follows:</p>
<p>"I greatly admire Your Excellency's opinion regarding the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement. What I wish to say is that after the establishment of this agreement, the long-standing historical relationship and shared heritage between the two countries will be restored, and the two countries can work together to strive for European peace."

<h3>Greece to Follow France's Lead and Cancel Mediterranean Mutual Guarantee</h3>
<p>Rome - According to Italian news reports, the Greek government is now going to cancel the guarantee given to Britain regarding the Mediterranean. The French government canceled it last week. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Comment on the New Agreement: De Facto Merger of Germany and Austria Increases Danger in Europe</h3>
<p>Paris - After the establishment of the agreement between Germany and Austria, newspapers are concerned about three things: 1. Germany and Austria have effectively merged in disguise. 2. The Stresa Front, previously formed by Britain, France, and Italy, has now been declared defunct. 3. After the two dictatorships of Italy and Germany unite, they will form a single force from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, dividing Europe in two and exerting pressure on the Balkan countries. In response to the crisis, many newspapers advocate close cooperation between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the countries of the Danube River basin. Renowned journalist Saint-Brice declared, "Germany and Austria have merged in spirit. This is a form of annexation, and its danger is no less than annexation itself. The previous alliance of Britain, France, and Italy against Germany's actions is now a thing of the past." A correspondent for Le Petit Parisien in Berlin reported, "The pre-World War I alliance of Germany, Italy, and Austria has been reorganized. Its goal is to dominate everything in Central and Eastern Europe." Renowned journalist Bertinau of L'Écho de Paris declared, "Italy's actions are greatly at odds with the obligations it accepted when signing the Locarno Treaties on October 16, 1925. We must demand an explanation." Le Petit Journal stated, "The only feasible policy is to organize the resistance that originally existed around Germany and in front of Italy. This is not to isolate Italy and Germany but to eliminate the aggressive ideas of the rulers of those countries. What we should do is nothing other than the establishment of an agreement between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia." Journalist Paul of L'Ordre declared, "Those in our country who worship Mussolini believed that Austria would be a divide between Germany and Italy. What is the situation now? For these people, it is imperative to admit their mistakes honestly and try to remedy them." (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Adopts a Cautious View: No Decisions Can Be Made Without Clearly Understanding Everything Beneath the Surface</h3>
<p>London - The London diplomatic community is now taking a cautious view of the German-Austrian rapprochement. They believe that the new agreement between the two countries can at least temporarily eliminate a dangerous point, but optimism should not be excessive, as the establishment of the agreement may not completely stop Germany from putting pressure on Austria. However, it is expected that Hitler will change his methods and exert pressure from within rather than from without. Although Austria has declared that it will not allow the National Socialist Party to engage in propaganda in Austria, it is the intention of people in the know that many National Socialist propagandists will now be given freedom. These people may not be willing to remain silent. Mussolini must have known and approved of this German-Austrian rapprochement. Whether Mussolini will now issue a new interpretation of the Four-Power Pact of 1933, which recognizes the Soviet Union's greater influence in European affairs, is also a point of speculation for many. The comments on the German-Austrian agreement in the newspapers here vary widely. The Morning Post stated that the agreement clearly cannot be taken at face value and that there must be ulterior motives. The Daily Mail said that the sanctions faction had forced Italy to ally with Germany and that in the future, we should no longer engage in suicidal interference in matters that are not remotely related to our interests. The British and German authorities should urgently seek a closer understanding. The Daily News welcomed the agreement, saying that it was an action toward European appeasement and could greatly reduce Britain's many obligations in Europe. The Daily Telegraph said that from a superficial point of view, the agreement was a good thing, but no decisions could be made lightly without understanding everything beneath the surface. The News shares the same view. The Daily Telegraph said that we must wait quietly to see the truth. The question is whether the extinguishing of one fire will not ignite a new one elsewhere. The Times welcomed the agreement, saying that Hitler could indeed be congratulated. Regardless of the current motives or ultimate intentions of the agreement, it can be used to appease Central Europe, improve its economic situation, and open the way for a permanent solution between the two major branches of the Germanic people. The Manchester Guardian said that Hitler's abandonment of the plan to merge Germany and Austria was because Germany was not currently willing to risk war and was therefore taking this temporary measure to carry out other plans. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Perspective</h3>
<p>Encourage Britain to Join This Group, Otherwise Submission Will Be Repeated</p>
<p>Moscow - The official authorities have refused to comment on the German-Austrian agreement. Political figures have criticized Britain's attitude and said that those who advocate maintaining the European status quo must now unite to resist Germany's policy of external expansion. It is also in Britain's interest to join this group, otherwise submission will be repeated, and German leader Hitler will become more emboldened. Moreover, the German-Austrian agreement is a natural result of Germany's unilateral abolition of the Locarno Treaties and the restoration of armed forces in the Rhineland. Based on this, the country has the possibility of invading Central Europe in order to form a strong group to isolate Eastern and Western Europe. As for what Italy will do regarding the German-Austrian agreement, political figures here are unwilling to show anything, but said, "Our relations with Italy are very satisfactory, and we do not want to say or do anything that would harm this relationship."

<h3>Romania Feels Uneasy: A Barrier Is Built Between France and the Little Entente; Military Alliance Between Romania and Russia Is Possible</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Romanian political circles were greatly disturbed by the news of the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, fearing that this would be the starting point for a confrontation between large groups of nations against the Balkan Entente and the Little Entente countries. Pessimists say that this is tantamount to building a barrier between the Little Entente countries and their allies to isolate them. Some people say that there is now a possibility of a military alliance between Soviet Russia and Romania. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Berlin and Rome Exchange Military Officers for Training, Saying It Is a Traditional Custom Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Rome - Several German officers from the infantry, cavalry, artillery, and air force have joined the Italian army for training. At the same time, several Italian officers will also go to Germany for training.

There are no other intentions. In addition, there are currently several officers from Britain, Austria, and Hungary in the Italian army for training. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany Re-Establishes Military Defense on Heligoland: Britain Has No Right to Inspect This Matter</h3>

<h3>Locarno Conference of Allied Powers Likely to Be Postponed: British Government Must Comprehensively Study the Impact of the German-Austrian Agreement</h3>
<p>London - After the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, some people in political circles here have proposed that the Second Locarno Conference (scheduled to be held in Brussels on the 22nd of this month) should be postponed immediately so that the British, French, and Italian authorities can hold diplomatic talks. The public is concerned about the understanding reached between Italy and Germany and fears that it will last for the longest possible time. Whether the Italian government will accept the invitation issued by the Belgian Prime Minister is still under consideration. Some say that the country has refused to participate because Germany has not been invited. It is not known which is the case. What is known is that these matters have now become secondary issues. The public's main concern is the crisis that the German-Austrian agreement may cause in Europe, which must be studied comprehensively. Regarding this, some people in political circles believe that Germany can still be expected to submit a reply to the British government's list of questions and therefore advocate taking a wait-and-see policy for the time being.

<h3>Montreux Conference Holds Plenary Session: Turkish Representative Issues Declaration: New Convention Does Not Necessarily Require Italy's Signature, But Declares Reservation of the Right to Conclude a Separate Agreement</h3>
<p>Montreux - The Montreux Conference held a plenary session this morning, during which Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras delivered a surprising speech, commenting on Italy's refusal to participate in the conference and proposing three points: 1. After the new convention is established, absent countries may not sign and join. 2. Once the draft of the new convention is established, the various clauses contained therein should be universally implemented. 3. After the new convention is established, Turkey may conclude similar agreements with any country based on the principles contained in this convention. (Agence Telegraphique Suisse Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Montreux - At the Montreux Conference, Turkish chief representative Foreign Minister Aras issued a declaration today, stating that because Italy has repeatedly refused to participate in the Montreux Conference, the Turkish government believes that the new Straits Convention does not necessarily require Italy's signature.

Turkey argued that they should be treated the same as warships. The conference decided to refer the matter to the technical committee for discussion and adjourned until 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. After the adjournment, the Turkish Foreign Minister told reporters in the lounge that the speech he had just given was not directed at Italy.

<h3>Failure of the Japanese National Policy Cabinet Meeting: Hirota Plots to Handle the Aftermath; The Deep-Seated Malpractices of Various Ministries Are Difficult to Eradicate; It Is Recognized That Administrative Institutions Need to Be Reformed</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The so-called National Policy Cabinet Meeting, which the government intended to use to renew all government affairs and for which it had made careful preparations before convening, was frustrated midway. The government believes that the reason for the failure of this cabinet meeting was that it had not clarified the national defense budget before ordering the ministries to submit draft national policies. As a result, the ministries felt insecure about the feasibility of important policies. In order to solve this fundamental problem, Prime Minister Hirota ordered the three chief cabinet secretaries to study the best method. If their conclusion is to clarify the outline of the national defense budget first, then notify Ministers Terauchi and Nagano of the army and navy ministries to convene a four-minister meeting of the prime minister, finance minister, and the two military ministers to jointly study countermeasures regarding the national defense budget and financial plans. (Allied Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The government's National Policy Conference was forced to dissolve after only three meetings due to the rampant pretense of national policy by various ministries. This clearly proves that the current administrative institutions are unable to eradicate the deep-seated malpractices of various ministries and demonstrates the major shortcomings of the current administrative institutions. Among the three chief cabinet secretaries, only the director of the Investigation Bureau has substantial policy proposals. Therefore, the director of the Investigation Bureau assists the Prime Minister in implementing national policies by taking and selecting them, and the national policies produced by the Investigation Bureau are naturally at the center. From this point of view, the issues of expanding and strengthening the Investigation Bureau, establishing a minister without portfolio, and reforming administrative institutions such as unifying the ministries should be re-examined. The government's plan centered on the cabinet meeting has completely failed. In the future, it plans to use the three ministers of Prime Minister Hirota, Finance Minister Baba, and Army Minister Terauchi as the center to decide on national policies. This shows that the current cabinet system cannot determine centralized national policies. In the future, when realizing comprehensive national policies from a broad perspective, it is necessary to impose certain restrictions on the cabinet system based on ministries.

<h3>French Democracy Commemorated: People Celebrate with Joy; Government Implements Extensive Social and Economic Plans; Improving the Wealth Distribution System Should Be Successful</h3>
<p>Paris - Tomorrow is National Day. Last night, it rained heavily, but the people were already dancing hand in hand on the streets, with a very large number of people. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party also held public celebrations in the Mingyue Park and the Buffalo Sports Ground south of the city, with a large number of participants. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - Tomorrow is French National Day. Since the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, this is the first time that the National Day commemoration is being conducted under the leadership of the left-wing Popular Front cabinet. In the Great Revolution of 1789 and the Second Revolution of 1848, the general idea was based on "social justice and freedom." This doctrine, which swept through the 18th century, not only inspired the French people but also had a tremendous impact on the economic life of France and most countries in Europe. The social and economic policies adopted by the current Popular Front cabinet are based on this idea. Its power is derived directly from the people. Therefore, observers believe that 1936 is a major turning point in French economic history. The result may be that France will transform into a "socialist republic," which is clearly different from the bourgeois conservative republic. France was originally a prosperous country, and the people could have enjoyed prosperity under a good economic organization. However, although the country is prosperous, "economic life is not fair," and the economic institutions established by the bourgeois republic should be held responsible for this. Recently, social movements have sprung up, leading to increased wages and improved working conditions. In the eyes of most people, this is not only a "real" victory for the working class in economic terms but also the prelude to the establishment of a new economic institution in France. This new institution is based on a "prosperity policy" and is completely different from the "contraction policy" previously implemented. The current cabinet's recent laws on social issues aim to reconcile the interests of the middle class, farmers, and the working class. At present, the public deeply hates and abhors the credit system and the means of selling short and buying long, believing that the credit system should be monopolized by the government and that the quantity of production should also be adjusted so that the production function can be concentrated in the hands of "real" producers. As for the recent labor unrest, people in various trade unions have repeatedly stated that workers on both sides are able to maintain order and not only do not damage the machinery in the factory but also often lubricate its interior. Their love for the machinery is evident. Therefore, these striking workers should not be seen as the sworn enemies of capitalists; on the contrary, they should be seen as liberators. These workers are so diligent that the output of goods will surely increase greatly in the future. Although the current output cannot be sold in full, the improvement of economic institutions will surely increase the living standards of the people across the country and increase their purchasing power. Furthermore, most of the French working class, including those on the far left, believe that the extensive economic plans that the current Popular Front cabinet has implemented to improve the wealth distribution system will surely be successful, leading France to lead the world's social movement and eliminating the atmosphere of the global recession.

<h3>British House of Commons Questions North China Smuggling</h3>

<h3>Smuggling: Southern Sales Route Cut Off, Tianjin and Jinan Still Rampant Smuggling Areas</h3>
<p>Nanjing - A visitor from Tianjin stated that before the establishment of the Chief Inspectorate for Preventing Smuggling by Road Transport, smuggled goods from North China had already invaded the markets of Hangzhou, Changsha, and other places for sale. Now, after customs officials rigorously carried out anti-smuggling operations, the southern sales route has indeed been cut off. According to business circles, one-fourth of smuggled goods from North China are sold south of Jinan, and three-fourths are sold north of Jinan. Because the sales route south of Jinan was blocked, Japanese and Korean ruffians are exerting all their efforts to operate between Tianjin and Jinan, causing Tianjin and Jinan to remain the most rampant areas for the loading and unloading of smuggled goods. The customs authorities are currently seeking solutions to this issue. Furthermore, customs officials at various anti-smuggling branches are demonstrating a spirit of not fearing death and not seeking money, fighting against smugglers, leaving a deep and positive impression on the Chinese people.

<h3>Central Memorial Week: Chiang Kai-shek Reports on Unification and National Salvation</h3>
<p>1. The foundation of diplomacy lies entirely in domestic affairs. Therefore, the unification of domestic affairs is the key to resisting foreign aggression.</p>
<p>2. The Central Government has consistently adopted a spirit of leniency towards the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, resolving everything through political channels and peaceful methods.</p>
<p>3. The unification of political and military orders is a fundamental requirement for dealing with foreign affairs.</p>
<p>4. The Central Government can never abandon the suppression of internal rebellion due to the severity of foreign troubles.</p>
<p>5. In resolving domestic political problems, both reason and emotion must be taken into consideration, but right and wrong, obedience and defiance, must also be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>6. The revolutionary government is determined to fight to the end amidst internal and external attacks from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Nanjing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a report at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 13th, titled "Unification and National Salvation." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, today the Central Government is holding the Premier's Memorial Week. I have been asked to give a report, and I would like to share my opinions and thoughts on recent national affairs with you. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is currently in session, and all comrades of our party, the general public of the country, and foreign friends all over the world are paying close attention to the results of this meeting. Originally, the most important issues of our meeting were domestic and foreign affairs as the center of the meeting. As for the direction of domestic and foreign affairs, the Fifth National Congress last year already had clear decisions. For the past six months, the Central Government has been working hard based on the directions decided by the Congress, and in the future, we will of course only proceed by following the established directions of the Fifth National Congress. However, we must understand that so-called domestic and foreign affairs, although different in name, are actually a completely interconnected thing. As a matter of fact, there is no distinction between foreign and domestic affairs. It can be said that foreign affairs problems are domestic affairs problems. If domestic problems cannot be properly resolved and the country cannot achieve true unification and lay a solid foundation, there is simply no diplomacy to speak of. Therefore, if we want to solve foreign affairs problems, we must first solve domestic problems. (To be continued) (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing - Chen Guangfu, Guo Bingwen, and Gu Yiqun arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th via postal airmail to report to the central authorities and Minister Kong in detail.

<p>Nanjing - Guo Bingwen discussed the international trade situation after his inspection in the United States, stating that countries around the world, in view of the decline in import and export goods after the implementation of tariff policies and import restrictions, now, except for Germany and Italy, which still adopt import restriction policies due to exchange rate relations, other countries have gradually moved towards liberalization in international trade. The voice of the so-called reciprocal movement has become very clamorous in our ears. Taking the United States as an example, as a result of efforts in this movement for two years, it has established reciprocal measures with 14 countries including Canada. However, although this liberalization and reciprocal movement is effectively implemented in other countries, whether it is suitable for adoption in our country and how it should be adopted still needs detailed discussion. As for the points that should be improved in our country's international trade, they are: 1. Reducing the trade deficit, 2. Encouraging exports, and there are also two basic ways to encourage exports: (A) Improving the quality of products, (B) Strengthening international trade organizations. Poor quality damages trade credit, and without sound international trade organizations, the promotion of direct trade is particularly fragile. The reporter also asked whether the previously reported news that the United States would form a trade company with China specializing in tung oil and other goods was true. According to Guo, the domestic price of tung oil in the United States is unstable, and there is no accurate statistic on how much our country can produce each year, as well as the issue of quality. Therefore, there was this proposal, but when it will be realized is not yet known. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

Liu Junqing and Xu Jishang were appointed to be responsible for contacting buyers. It is expected that 30-40% of the capital can be recovered. The mill is one of the six major cotton mills in Beiyang and was considered the most successful in operation among the mills. The reasons for the sale are: 1. Old machinery and no funds for renovation; 2. Shareholders feared that the Japanese cotton industry intended to control the North China textile market and dared not continue to invest; 3. Banks refused to grant loans; 4. Overdue foreign debts were urged too urgently and there was no way to turn around. The shareholders also resolved to work hard to maintain operations before the sale to avoid the plight of thousands of workers. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Misunderstanding Between Chinese and Japanese Troops in Dagu; Swift Handling Prevented Escalation; Our Side Apologized, Japanese Side Understood; Japanese Headquarters Dispatched Personnel Southward to Investigate</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: On the 9th of this month, a conflict occurred between the 29th Army stationed in Dagukou and the Japanese army due to a misunderstanding. The authorities responded promptly and swiftly, preventing the escalation of the situation. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese resident army in Lutanggu, the Kagawa unit, consisting of thirty infantry soldiers, conducted a forced march along the Hai River during an exercise on the afternoon of the 9th at 2:00 PM. They rowed a small boat towards East Dagu, intending to land. The 1st Battalion of the Liu Regiment, 133rd Brigade, 43rd Division, under Liu Ruming of the 29th Army, was stationed there. The regiment headquarters of the Yu Regiment was located in that area. The Chinese side had not received any prior notification of the Japanese army's march, nor had they received any orders from superiors to provide protection. Upon seeing the Japanese troops landing, they suspected malicious intent and attempted to stop them. The Japanese army did not listen, leading to a misunderstanding and gunfire exchange, lasting several minutes, without any casualties on either side. Both sides' officers received reports, rushed to the scene, and separately ordered their troops to cease fire. The Japanese army then withdrew. Song Zheyuan was informed that evening and immediately telegraphed Regiment Commander Liu to resolve the matter locally to prevent escalation. On the 10th, Liu visited the Japanese army captain Kagawa, expressed his apologies, and explained the misunderstanding. Kagawa, being understanding, also acknowledged some fault on his side. The matter was resolved tacitly that evening. Song Zheyuan, still concerned about potential dissatisfaction from the Japanese military headquarters, ordered Chen Zhongfu to come to Tianjin to investigate and visit Yongjian. Chen arrived in Tianjin on the night of the 10th. On the morning of the 11th, after Zhang Zizhong summoned Regiment Commander Liu to inquire about the truth, Chen Zhongfu visited Yongjian at the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple, explaining the details of the incident. Yongjian, claiming not to have received a detailed report, did not express much, only saying that if the incident was indeed unintentional and a misunderstanding, the Japanese side would not take it seriously. Furthermore, at noon on the 10th, Yongjian, accompanied by Staff Officer Ikeda, Senior Adjutant Otake, and more than 30 soldiers, traveled to Tanggu in six cars to meet with Kagawa and investigate Dagu. They returned to Tianjin at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Although Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong had no direct responsibility for the matter, he feared potential complications. Therefore, upon hearing of Yongjian's return from the investigation, he ordered Municipal Government Secretary-General Ma Yanchong, along with Japanese Secretary Lu Nansheng, to visit Yongjian at Haiguang Temple to further explain the situation after Chen Zhongfu's visit. Yongjian expressed a positive attitude, hoping that the local garrison would be instructed to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. That evening, Zhang Zizhong telegraphed Liu Ruming, ordering him to instruct the 133rd Brigade to send Chief of Staff Zhao to Dagu to gather the garrison and give a lecture. After investigating the incident, a report should be prepared for record-keeping. Japanese Army Commander Tashiro went to Yuzhou and Qin areas on the 9th to inspect the troops. He returned to Tanggu on the afternoon of the 11th to inspect the local troops, and returned to Tianjin in the evening. Although he heard about the incident, he did not express any opinion. Therefore, as of the 12th, the matter seemed to be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>The Japanese Garrison Army Headquarters in North China recently dispatched Senior Staff Officer Ishii Kaho and subordinate Hamada Sakuyoshi southward. They first attended a meeting of military attachés in China convened by the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, then went to Nanjing, and then traveled along the Yangtze River basin to Wuhan and Changsha for investigation. On their return journey, they entered Henan via the Pinghan Railway, visiting Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, and were expected to return to Tianjin in about 20 days. Military Attaché Imai of the Embassy in Peiping also accompanied them. (12th)</p>
<h3>Strict Prevention of Espionage Activities in Chaozhou and Shantou; Spies from a Certain Country Deeply Penetrating the Hinterland; Extremely Tight Organizations</h3>
<p>Shantou dispatch: A certain country is becoming increasingly active in plotting against us, and has formed espionage teams, distributing them to the hinterlands of our various provinces to spy on military intelligence and geographical conditions. Such activities have been discovered in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas. These individuals all speak fluent local dialects, dress no differently from Chaozhou and Meizhou people, and maintain close ties with the poor in the shantytowns. They often marry Chaozhou women, becoming sons-in-law and establishing kinship ties. These individuals secretly provide their wives with living expenses of six or seven yuan per month. It has been discovered that there are approximately 600 registered foreign nationals from a certain country in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas. Those who travel back and forth without a fixed residence and who protect the transportation of goods into the interior number about four or five hundred. These individuals are all veterans who have undergone rigorous training, are directed by their highest authorities, and undertake special missions. It is reported that their organization is divided into five major detachments: North China, Central China, South China, Northwest, and Southwest. Each detachment is divided into three battalions, each battalion into three companies, and a special company. Each company is divided into five or six groups. In the Shantou urban area, which is divided into six public security sub-bureaus, the espionage team is also divided into six groups, each group consisting of approximately five to eleven people. The detachment, battalion, and company commanders are all from that certain country, while the organizational elements are Taiwanese and Korean people. The internal structure of the organization is extremely tight and resembles a military organization. Each company has a mobile instructor who works for a very short time, traveling to Taiwan, Fuzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and other places to train and guide the personnel. Those recruited in China are first allowed to acquire Taiwanese or Korean citizenship and receive some form of guarantee before undergoing practical training. The curriculum includes espionage concepts, research on espionage, military reconnaissance techniques, sky communication methods, disguise techniques, photography techniques, Chinese transportation geography, wireless communication and its usage, Roman character codes, espionage and communication techniques, the psychology of the Chinese people, and social skills for entering public places. The training period is four months, followed by correspondence courses in business, national policy lectures, organizational law, and various general courses. There is even training in handling dangerous situations, giving statements, and so on. It is reported that the composition of the members is extremely complex. The situation in Chaozhou and Shantou has become very serious recently, so the garrison has been particularly vigilant against these individuals. Peng Zhifang, stationed in Chaozhou, convened a meeting of district chiefs and police chiefs of the public security sub-bureaus on the 4th to discuss methods for reporting traitors, spies, and communists and reactionaries, requiring the district and township joint security system to complete the reporting according to the deadline. The methods are as follows: If any villager is found to be acting as a traitor or communist within the territory, the district or township chief should secretly investigate and report them. If any stranger or spy infiltrates the territory, they should immediately be reported to the local district or township office in accordance with the reporting procedure, which will be forwarded to the public security bureau for handling. If any district or township chief intends to harbor or conceal a spy or traitor who infiltrates the territory and fails to report them, they will be charged with the crime of harboring them once discovered. All villagers are responsible for finding ways to assist or investigate. When reporting, the reporter may personally go to the reporting agency to report, but must not falsely accuse due to personal grievances, which may result in a counter-accusation. Furthermore, in Jieyang, Chenghai, Raoping, and other counties, the military and police have been urging the thorough investigation of the population in various villages, implementing armed roll calls and a five-household joint security system. In the future, if one household accommodates relatives from other villages without reporting to the district or township office, all five households in the joint security system will be held responsible once the roll call reveals the violation. The inspection is currently being implemented very strictly.</p>
<h3>County-Wide Strike in Wuxi Silk Factories; Party and Government Agencies Dispatched Personnel to Mediate in Thirty-Six Factories Including Wufeng</h3>
<p>Wuxi dispatch: Female workers in silk factories such as Wufeng and Ruichang in Gushanbang, Wuxi County, went on strike because their demands for improved treatment from the factories were not met. It is reported that on the 11th, a total of eleven silk factories were on strike, including Dingcheng, Wufeng, Ruichang, Wanchang, Yongxing, Ganshen, Baolan, and Yongsheng, involving approximately 3,000 female workers. The iron gates and glass windows of the Ganshen and Baofeng factories were damaged by the crowd, and miscellaneous items in the workshop of the Yongsheng Silk Factory were destroyed. The director of management, Zhang Xian, was also beaten and injured. Upon receiving the news, the Silk Factory Industry Union of the General Labor Union dispatched personnel to persuade them. The Security Brigade, the Public Security Bureau, the Inspection Office, the Mobile Patrol Team, the Water Patrol Team, and the Second and Sixth Sub-Bureaus of the Public Security Bureau also dispatched officers and led all the police officers to the scene to suppress the crowd. The female workers then went to the Silk Factory Industry Union and put forward four demands: 1. Working hours: Requesting a six-in-six-out system. 2. Restoring the standard daily wage of 57 cents. 3. Four days of reward work per month. 4. Stipulating that work be suspended on the 1st and 16th of each month, and wages be paid on the 15th. The Industry Union fully accepted the above demands and promised to negotiate with the employers immediately. At the same time, Sun Xiangfeng of the Party Committee and Tang Puan, a preparatory member of the General Labor Union, spoke to the female workers and advised them to strictly observe order and wait patiently for mediation. The female workers were satisfied and dispersed. At the same time, Qian Fenghao, Xue Shouyi, Chen Zhanru, Hua Shaochun, Jiang Daoshan, Xue Zukang, Xue Runpei, and more than forty other members of the Silk Factory Association also went to the county government to petition, requesting that measures be taken to stop the strike and requesting protection. Secretary Wang Rongsan received them and promised to relay the situation to the county magistrate, convene a negotiation between labor and management with the Party Department, and make a round-table solution. If the workers took any out-of-line actions, they would be strictly dealt with according to the law. At this point, the representatives left. On the morning of the 13th, the female workers of twenty-five silk factories, including Dacheng, Minfeng, Zhenyi, Yichang, Yuji, Qianfeng, Gongda, Sanxing, Guangcheng, Jiatai, Longchang, and Taichang, continued the strike. Only the Ruilun and Luzhuangzhen silk factories in the Yuqi rural area continued to operate normally. The female workers of the Taichang Silk Factory in Nanmen suddenly clashed with the police officers of the Third Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau on the morning of the 13th. As a result, more than ten female workers were injured, and those who were seriously injured were sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. The rest were gathered at the Labor Union, asking for relief. County Magistrate Long Tiyao, due to the expansion of the turmoil, ordered the dispatch of security teams to suppress it and ordered the Public Security Bureau to pay close attention and take effective precautions for the sake of public order.

However, the workers remained firm and stated that they would not give up until their goals were achieved. County Magistrate Long of the County Government, in order to resolve the labor dispute, convened a mediation meeting of representatives of labor and management at 5:00 PM in the afternoon, urging the representatives to order the workers to resume work first, and then discuss and resolve the issue of improving treatment and increasing wages.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Counterfeit Currency Operation Busted</h3>
<p>Wang Jisheng, a 36-year-old from Yancheng, an unemployed vagrant, recently set up a secret operation at No. 34 Old Changshu front gate in the city to counterfeit banknotes and corner notes, distributing them to accomplices to sell in the villages. The villagers, unaware, were often deceived by him. The scheme was discovered by Director Pan of the Second Public Security Sub-Bureau, who sent Inspector Shen and police officers on the night of the 12th at around 11:00 PM. They captured the main offender, Wang Jisheng, on the spot, and also apprehended a woman, Wang Hao. Counterfeit Central Bank and Bank of China subsidiary currency notes, as well as counterfeit one-yuan banknotes of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Bank, and counterfeit currency seals were seized and taken to the sub-bureau.

<h3>East Pavilion Double Lotus in Full Bloom</h3>
<p>The double lotus in the East Pavilion of the Justice area of the county was hand-planted by the Ming dynasty recluse Gu Dehui. It has a long history and is extremely precious. Now, in the height of summer, the double lotus is about to bloom in full splendor, charming and moving. It is very interesting to visit and enjoy the scenery, so the number of visitors has gradually increased, and it is expected that the scene will be even more spectacular than in previous years.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Fire Destroys Eight Homes</h3>
<p>The home of Shi Asong, a resident of the third Jia, first Bao of Luqu Bridge Town in the fourth district, suddenly caught fire at 4:00 AM on the 11th, burning through the roof and spreading to the homes of Feng Houyan, Sha Zhonghu, Feng Wangzhen, Feng Yushan, Liu He, Feng Peisheng, and Feng Xijin. The fire was very fierce. The local fire brigade responded to the alarm, drove dragons to the scene, and drew water to extinguish the fire. It took three hours to put it out, but the above eight houses had already been reduced to ashes. Among them, the losses of Feng Yushan, Liu He, and Sha Zhonghu were the most severe. As for the cause of the fire, it is said that Shi Asong's family was cooking mianyi bing (a type of pancake), and the remaining fire caused the accumulation of firewood to ignite.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Bandits Extort Huge Sum</h3>
<p>Xu Guirong, the head of Laonan Township in the first district of Wu County, recently received two identical letters of intimidation delivered by mail, demanding 3,000 yuan and setting a deadline for payment, otherwise, his life and property would be in danger. Xu then came to the city to report to the First Public Security Sub-Bureau, requesting apprehension. The director of the sub-bureau ordered the police chief of the Fourth Precinct, Li Yuyan, to investigate. Police Chief Li immediately led plainclothes police to the vicinity of Yang Bridge, west of Zhouzhuang Village, and laid an ambush on all sides, waiting until midnight. He vaguely saw a person emerging from the reeds, immediately stepped forward to capture him, and searched him for iron tools, a straw basket, and a cloth bag, which were brought to the precinct together. Under interrogation, he identified himself as Mao Shengda, admitting only to theft and not to extortion. He was escorted to the First Sub-Bureau and transferred to the local court for interrogation on the 12th. The search for the perpetrators of the intimidation case is still underway.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Education Bureau Director Accused</h3>
<p>Chen Yue, the director of the Education Bureau of this county, has been suffering from a serious illness since mid-April of this year. He has been bleeding from his mouth and nose all day long. He had applied for leave to the Education Department. By the time of the term change, the duties of the bureau were all presided over by Jiang Yinghuai, the director of Social Education. The education sector is very dissatisfied with this. Now, Chen Yue's illness is even more critical, but the bureau has instead applied to the higher authorities to cancel his leave. In fact, Chen is bedridden and unable to go to the bureau to work. Now, the public has listed ten major facts of the Education Bureau and reported them to the department, requesting a thorough investigation. The Education Department has ordered the bureau on the 11th to order Chen Yue to make his own statement.</p>
<h3>Baimao Sluice Gate Scheduled for Completion</h3>
<p>The Baimao Giant Sluice Gate in this county, which is related to the water conservancy of seven counties in Jiangsu Province, was allocated 400,000 yuan by the National Economic Commission and started construction in Zhangjia City in this county in February of this year. As of today, it will be five months, and 70-80% of the gate foundation and other projects have been completed. If the weather is not rainy, the entire project can be completed in early August. The project office has tentatively scheduled the inauguration ceremony for August 10 and reported it to the Economic Commission for approval.</p>

The museum will set up a special room specifically for the display of the large whale.</p>
<h3>Fire at Zhakou West Lake</h3>
<p>The home of Yu Linyuan, a resident of No. 11 Ganshui Lane, Zhakou, caught fire due to carelessness with mosquito coils at around 12:00 PM on the 12th. In an instant, the fire spread and was beyond approach. At that time, due to the strong northeasterly wind, the fire was even more fierce, taking advantage of the wind. Residents were awakened from their sleep, and they did not even have time to move their belongings. Cries shook the sky. The fire brigade and the fire station arrived one after another to rescue, but due to the lack of water source, they connected to the reservoir of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, which was about three miles away from the fire, and used belts to draw water to extinguish the fire. It was not extinguished until 3:30 AM. It is estimated that 53 houses, a total of 81 households, were burned down, with losses of more than 50,000 yuan. Also, the home of Wu Meisheng, a resident of Tongli Bridge, Maojiabu, West Lake, caught fire again due to the re-ignition of Maochai ash at around 4:00 AM. After going back to rescue, the fire was extinguished at 5:00 AM, burning down 11 houses, with losses of about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Yao Salt Police Suffers Further Harm</h3>
<p>After the Yiyao Light Tax Salt Patrol Team had three salt patrolmen killed and thrown into the river last month, the case has not yet been solved. Unexpectedly, the salt patrol squad leader Zhou Youquan and Xing Yueqiao led Ding patrolmen to suppress smuggling in the Hengxi area the other day. They were surrounded by a large number of smugglers, who gathered and beat them, and took away their guns. As a result, except for one patrolman who managed to escape in the meantime, Zhou Youquan was hit on the head, and his brain matter flowed out. Xing Yueqiao's eyes protruded, and all his front teeth fell out. They both died one after another, and one patrolman was seriously injured. The smugglers then left triumphantly. After receiving the news, the office immediately sent a team to transport the casualties to the city and report to the hospital to apprehend the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Strictly Implement Comprehensive Investigation of Opium and Drugs</h3>
<p>The Yin County Government and the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, upon receiving provincial orders to eliminate the remaining opium and drugs in the territory, from the 11th of this month to the 25th of this month, will jointly conduct investigations from house to house with the district and baojia heads, still allowing for lenient supplementary registration. After the investigation is completed, from the 26th of this month to August 4th, the Ningbo Public Security Bureau will conduct a review, ordering the elimination of drug atmosphere by the deadline.</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Anecdote from the Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying</p>
<p>North Mountain Waterfall</p>
<p>Scenic spots and historical sites throughout the country are of utmost importance to the nation's culture. According to a survey by the Ministry of Interior, Zhejiang Province has the most scenic spots and historical sites, totaling 1,872. Among these, eastern Zhejiang is particularly rich, and within eastern Zhejiang, North Mountain in Jinhua is the most famous.</p>
<p>North Mountain is fifteen kilometers from the city. The mountain is full of rocky caves and gushing clear springs and waterfalls, making it easy for vegetation to thrive, painting the outskirts into a beautiful, lush, and majestic picture. The local people who "live off the mountain" even try to blast open the rocky cliffs, burn them into lime, and carry them to the city to sell. Lime is a fertilizer, and it's the season for fertilizing fields. Along the way, you see children of twelve or thirteen, all carrying small loads to sell. After all, they are young, and the way they hurry with small steps, hunched over and panting, looks truly pitiful.</p>
<p>A secluded path leads into a mountain trap, and the sound of rushing water is like music played by the mountain spirits, constantly playing for you. The outer cave is spacious like a deep star, about four or five yards high and wide, and about six or seven yards deep. There are five clear springs that flow out from the small opening of the inner cave. Sweating profusely, you feel cool and refreshed the moment you enter the cave. The inner cave is entered through that water outlet. The opening is only four or five feet in diameter and is almost completely filled with the water flow. In search of this eerie, dark water cave, it is said that if you boldly venture inside, you'll find a spectacular view in a fire palace. Don't say you don't believe it. Even Xu Xiake, when he came to visit, probably didn't go in, but kept his honorable legs outside the cave. I leaned back, lying in a specially made wooden basin, and nearly scraped off my nose as I rowed in. It was about two yards long. I left the basin and went ashore, and looked in the light of the gas lamp. It really was another world. If you wanted to use it to hide from iron birds dropping eggs, you could hide at least five thousand people. Stalactites and rocks lined the walls, a dazzling sight. Two rock veins rose from the top of the cave, one blue and one yellow, twisting and dancing, very much like dragons. They had heads, tails, scales, and claws, truly lifelike. This cave is named Dragon Transformation Cave because of this, and the flowing water is called Dragon Transformation Spring Water. Continuing to twist, turn, and slip westward, there are even more strange and bizarre shapes, some resembling lions, elephants, phoenixes, and turtles, too numerous to mention. Following the east wall, you can turn back from the original entrance. The journey is about half a mile.</p>
<p>Leaving Double Dragon Cave and climbing up another slope, only half a mile away, you arrive at Ice Kettle Cave. Double Dragon Cave is horizontal, like a gourd lying on its side, with a large mouth, a very thin waist, and a wide, flat rear. The heart is strange and bizarre. Ice Kettle Cave is vertical, with a small mouth and a large, deep belly. Step by step, you carefully descend the stairs, counting 260 steps (stone steps carved on the spot). After descending the first twenty or thirty steps, the sunlight gradually dims and darkens, and a cold air strikes. You faintly hear the sound of gurgling water. Descending another thirty or forty steps, you suddenly see a large waterfall about ten yards long pouring down from the rock wall at the top, the sound rumbling like thunder. Ice flowers and jade fragments splash on your body, like a fine rain. The water power stirs up a hidden wind, making you want to turn back in fear. But if you summon your courage and go down, you can walk behind the waterfall. At the point where the waterfall falls, there is no deep pool of water. Looking up at the cave entrance from behind the waterfall, a pale line of skylight illuminates the waterfall into a crystal curtain, making you feel an indescribable sense of comfort and beauty. Other waterfalls are outside the mountain, but this one is in its belly. I'm afraid it would be difficult to find such a spectacular sight again, even after traveling through all the famous scenic spots in the country. Continuing to step down a sloping two or thirty steps, you see the water flowing quietly from the bottom of the cave, said to come from True Morning Cave and flow down to Double Dragon Cave. The three caves are all on the same mountain, all facing west. This theory is very plausible. When turning out, the gas lamp light accidentally touched a bat cave. Hundreds of them flew wildly.</p>
<p>True Morning Cave is two miles above Ice Kettle Cave. Fearing that going there would delay my return, I only sat in the Ice Kettle Pavilion outside Ice Kettle Cave, asking the guides about the situation. This cave is also called Upper Cave. The words "Thirty-Six Heavens" are carved at the entrance of the cave. The cave entrance is open and bright, with many inner caves branching out. The places that tourists often visit are about a mile deep. The cave path is flat, sloping, wide, and narrow, without any certainty. Generally, about one or two miles deep, there is a half-moon-shaped hole that allows light to pass through. It is called a "Line of Sky." Further inside, at "Celestial Pool" wall, there are the words "Stop Here" carved, which are said to be written by Zhu Wen Gong.</p>
<p>The Ice Kettle Pavilion mentioned earlier was newly built by Luo Zhuoying, commander of the Eighteenth Army. Tourists entering Ice Kettle from the heat or exiting Ice Kettle from the cold all need to rest in this pavilion for a while. The pavilion is not yet finished and has no plaques or couplets. It is said to be called "Ice Kettle Pavilion." Is this the case? Later, when I saw Luo in Qu County, I forgot to ask him again. Below the pavilion is Golden Flower Temple. According to research, it was formerly known as Cloud Screen Taoist Temple, founded by Cheng Zhou. Anqisheng in the states of the warring period and Chisongzi of the Jin Dynasty both ascended to immortality here. It was renamed to its current name during the Tang Dynasty, and was then submerged in the Yuan Dynasty. The current site was newly developed in 1933 by local Huang Weishi and others. It is a hotel in nature, and can provide tourists with accommodation and food. Nearby, there are also famous scenic spots such as Lecture Hall Cave (where Liu Jun of the Southern Dynasties studied), Deer Field Academy, Stone Chessboard, Pan Spring, and Elixir Refining Mountain. Therefore, there are many tourists in spring and autumn.</p>
<p>Jinhua's Dou Niu</p>
<p>Jinhua is not only beautiful in its scenery and products, but also has a considerable position in Chinese historiography. The so-called Eastern Zhejiang School originated here. However, although Jinhua has always had a strong literary style and developed school education, there is a superstitious custom among the people called "Dou Niu." Every winter and summer rainy season, it is still held from time to time. When the fighting starts, the sound travels far, and the spectators are as thick as the mountains and sea. The enthusiasm and encouragement are several times stronger than any ticketed sports meeting. Although it is said that it does not have much meaning.</p>
<p>Dou Niu, broadly speaking, is also called Cao Niu. When fighting, each bull has a special name. Some are called Wu Song, Weicheng, Su Tianba, or Xue Rengui; some are called Hero Hanging, Moldy Face, Big Actress, or Little Anything. The cattle-raising farmers take their fancy, and announce them on the program of performances. In the eyes of the bull owners, a bull that is about to go out to fight is no longer just a bull, but simply a brave general who can stand out, break through the enemy, make a name for himself, and show glory to his master. In the few days before this great general is about to make a "bull" contribution, the master truly has the attitude of "unclothing to clothe him and offering food to feed him" when it comes to the feeding problem. Every meal must be a well-cooked pot of glutinous rice porridge, mixed with a few taels of opium. Or add ginseng soup and fine wine to the meal. In the hot summer, he also helps to scratch his itch, swat flies, and fan him to cool off. At night, he must hang a cloth tent for him to prevent mosquitoes from disturbing his sweet dreams. It is said that this can greatly increase the power of the bull general, making him brave and invincible on the battlefield. As for the money spent, even borrowing is not a problem. The bull general's power greatly increased, and the bull owner certainly could not ask for more. However, if the bull goes wild and kicks and injures the audience, it is not a good thing. Therefore, the bullfighting field is not selected on a vacant flat ground, but in a rotten and sticky paddy field. During the fight, the bull generals are led in pairs in order, each using their horns to butt each other. If they are slightly tilted and about to butt their necks, a fair person will correct them, and they will continue to butt until one bull cannot support himself and retreats. Only then will the outcome be initially determined. Afterwards, they will have to come back twice, and the overall ending will be announced at the end of the game. At the same time, there is more than one pair of bulls fighting. Each pair fights in their own territory and will not affect other pairs, which is the function of mud binding their hooves.</p>
<p>For the bull that wins the fight, the owner will drape red silk on his tall and upright horns, insert golden flowers, and announce the victory. At that time, the bull owner, with his eyebrows dancing and face flushed, leads the mighty bull general, truly with the spirit of a "top scholar parading the streets on horseback", feeling that there is no equal. Relatives, friends, or spectators are bound to use paper cannons and red flowers to congratulate him. There are also those who lead sheep and carry wine to recognize the "bull-in-law", with an enthusiasm that is even greater than that of the in-laws of children. Afterwards, as the saying goes, "when the birds are gone, the good bow is hidden", the bull general who has removed the golden flowers and red silk is of course invited back to the stable to eat old grass. If the bull general does not understand the owner's intentions and is unwilling to put in a lot of effort on the battlefield, so that he is defeated in "three declines and exhaustion", or is blindly led by someone into a cement beach, and after kissing each other with the enemy general, he seems to know that they are both of the same kind, and is unwilling to let others provoke and harm each other, then after returning, he will definitely be considered unlucky by the cruel owner and driven into the slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>It is said that this bullfighting trend has been passed down since the time of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty. The intention is to thank the gods. It is also said that the land in Jinhua and Yiwu counties is hard (it is not known why). If there is no bullfighting, it is easy to suffer from fire, or a murder case will occur. The land in Lanxi is not hard. Once, there was a fire during a bullfight, and afterwards, no one fought. Years ago, at the Jinhua Railway Station, a grand bullfight was held at the opening ceremony. People from Shanghai and Hangzhou came to visit. Recently, in a certain village on the border of Jinhua and Yiwu, it is rumored that a bullfight is about to take place again. But in this severe heat, who has the mood to watch these stupid creatures fighting each other?</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Guangdong Air Force Pilots Tang and Tan Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday Evening to Report to Authorities in Nanjing, Announcing Chen Jitang's Ten Major Crimes</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that since the military disturbances occurred in Guangdong Province, all military officers have opposed Chen Jitang's improper measures, regarding the lives of the nation and its people as child's play. They have left Guangdong one after another and returned to the Central Government. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, Tang Xiawei and Tan Xiaoyan, pilots of the Fourth Squadron of the Guangdong Air Force, arrived in Shanghai on the Coolidge Presidential Liner of the Dala Company. After staying at the New Asia Hotel to rest, they took the express train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM that evening to report to the authorities. Tang and Tan met with the Dagong News Agency reporter alone, detailing the process and showing a telegram to the Central Authorities, as well as a written original announcing Chen Jitang's Ten Major Crimes. These are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Authorities: Chairman Lin of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Jiang, Chen, Li, Bai, and other rebels are ostensibly using the beautiful name of resisting Japan and saving the country, but are secretly taking up arms to create chaos. Every air force comrade is heartbroken. Now that the country is in a difficult situation, ending the conflict is the way to resist humiliation, and unification is the way to seek survival. Xiawei and Xiaoyan swear to be the vanguard. We are eagerly awaiting orders. Pilots Tang Xiawei and Tan Xiaoyan of the Fourth Squadron of the Guangdong Air Force, respectfully.</p>
<p>Chen's Crimes: To be forwarded to all compatriots across the country by the newspapers. The rebel Chen Jitang has raised troops in Guangdong, using the name of resisting Japan to carry out the reality of betraying the Central Government. All enthusiastic compatriots are indignant. Xiawei and Xiaoyan, serving in the Guangdong Air Force, have dedicated themselves to the Party and the country, always taking protecting the country and its people as their duty, and never knowing what private tools are. Chen's rebellion is not only a disaster for the country and its people internally, but also incurs international contempt externally. Xiawei and Xiaoyan are driven by their duties and blamed by their conscience, unwilling to be used by others to do evil against their conscience. Therefore, they resolutely leave Guangdong and ask the Central Government to punish the rebels. Here, we respectfully disclose Chen's crimes as follows: Rebelling against the Central Government, Chen Jitang has been occupying Guangdong for many years, using the Southwest organs to restrain the Central Government and treating the Central Government's orders as insignificant. This is his first crime. Selling silver, since the Central Government implemented legal flaws, Chen took the opportunity to collect more than 90 million in silver from the people, not as a fund for legal tender, but sold it to people from a certain country to purchase arms. This is his second crime. Over-expanding the military quota, the Guangdong army originally had three armies, but since Chen raised the banner of resisting Japan, he has expanded four or five armies, hoping to expand his strength to resist the Central Government. This is his third crime. Issuing paper money indiscriminately, Guangdong Province collected only more than 90 million in silver, but Chen issued more than 200 million in mixed paper money. According to the regulation that 60% of the cash is a reserve fund, he has indeed committed a crime. This is his fourth crime. Destroying education, Chen has devastated education in Guangdong Province in every possible way, such as owing the salaries of provincial and municipal teachers for more than half a year. Recently, he has even failed to assess his abilities and has strongly supported Zhongshan Middle School, oppressing outstanding students. This is his fifth crime. Levying miscellaneous taxes harshly, Chen has been entrenched in Guangdong Province, harshly levying miscellaneous taxes, without leaving a single gap. For example, Guangzhou collects a full month's rent for housing, and there are more than three months in a year. This is his sixth crime. Transporting smuggled goods, Chen Weizhou uses warships or anti-smuggling ships to travel between Guangdong and Hong Kong to transport smuggled goods. This is his seventh crime. Harming loyal people, Chen is small-minded and suspicious, secretly executing loyal people at any time. The recent murders of Wu Cangsang and Wang Yangchong are clear evidence. This is his eighth crime. Purchasing real estate, Chen has been entrenched in Guangdong Province for several years, scraping the people's fat and blood for his own use, and has purchased millions of houses in Hong Kong. This is his ninth crime. Believing in demon magic, since Chen appointed his brother Chen Weizhou, he has become particularly superstitious about surveying and physiognomy. Anyone who wants to get a job from Chen must be evaluated by Chen Weizhou, who looks at his physiognomy and arranges his eight characters before hiring him. This is his tenth crime. In addition, there are also crimes such as controlling public opinion, raping popular will, deducting salaries, killing young people, and forcibly occupying Hong Xiuquan's tomb. It is impossible to record all the crimes. This is just what Xiawei and Xiaoyan have seen in their daily lives, exposing them to the people of the country so that they can all know that this evil warlord only knows how to devastate the people and cannot take on great responsibilities. If this rebel is not eliminated for a day, the country will never have peace. I hope that the Central Government will make plans as soon as possible to eliminate the rebels. Xiawei and Xiaoyan, whose duties belong to the military, should do what they should do, and dare not resign even if they are wading through boiling water. We respectfully inform you, hoping that you will examine it. Pilots Tang Xiawei and Tan Xiaolai of the Fourth Squadron of the Guangdong Air Force, respectfully.</p>
<p>Continued Arrivals from the North: Furthermore, Mr. Tang told the Dagong News Agency reporter that there were a total of more than 280 air force personnel in Guangdong Province. Now, they are all dissatisfied with the authorities' actions and have resigned one after another. It is estimated that more than 20 people have already entered Nanjing, and the rest of the personnel will also take ships north one after another.</p>
<h3>Silver Syndicate to End at the End of the Month, Most of the Money Has Been Returned, the Remainder Will Be Returned This Month</h3>
<p>The Jiangzhe Spring Silkworm Cocoon Loan Syndicate, organized by the financial community of this city in the 25th year, includes 20 institutions such as the China Communications Bank, the Four Banks Savings Association, the Postal Savings Bureau, and Fuyuan Money House, with a total investment of 30 million yuan. The general office is located in the General Office of Communications, and branch offices are located in the Bank of China in Wuxi and Hangzhou. Loan registration began on May 10 and ended on June 10. The amount of money released has exceeded 10 million yuan, of which Jiangsu Province accounts for 80% and Zhejiang Province only accounts for 20%. After the fresh cocoons in the two provinces were collected, the loans were returned one after another. The general office reimbursed each lending bank at any time. It is known that the amount already returned has reached 80 to 90% of the total loan amount, and there are still more than 200,000 yuan. It is expected that it can be repaid within this month. It is heard that the syndicate plans to hold a meeting at the end of the month to handle the closing matters.</p>
<h3>Consular Body Requests Revision of the Draft Agreement on Factory Inspection, the Bureau of Public Works Has Informed the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Faithful talk about future negotiation steps, this case is difficult to get a final solution at one time</p>
<p>Regarding the draft agreement on the Factory Law in the inland factories of the Shanghai Public Concession, it has not been approved by the Consular Body. The leader and consul Bai Hezao Nan sent a letter to Arnold, the General Manager of the Bureau of Public Works, requesting revisions to our side, believing that it cannot be applied to the Enjoy Sound Agency. The reporter visited Faithun yesterday to inquire about everything. Fei was the representative of the Bureau of Public Works in negotiating this agreement draft. He has done his best to support this case, but he has not been understood by the Consular Body. Of course, he is unhappy. According to Fei, he has informed Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, of the Consular Body's intention. There is no appointment with Yu. How to negotiate in the future depends on the opinions of the Chinese side. After investigation, the Chinese side of this case entrusted the Municipal Government to handle it through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Now, the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce must consult with each other and wait for a negotiation strategy to be obtained. Ask the Central Government for instructions before continuing negotiations, and it may be difficult to get a final solution at one time.</p>
<h3>Murder of Japanese Resident Xuan Sheng, Talk by Responsible Person of the Municipal Government, Orders the Public Security Bureau to Offer a Reward for the Arrest of the Murderer, the Public Security Bureau Engages in Detective Work Day and Night</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that regarding the stabbing of Japanese resident Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo on Dusiwei Road and Qimei Road on the 10th of this month, yesterday, the person in charge of the Municipal Government issued a statement saying that since the stabbing of Japanese resident Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo occurred, the Municipal Government has decided on detailed and concrete measures for arresting the murderer and strengthening the protection of Japanese residents, ordering the Public Security Bureau to strictly and earnestly implement them. It is hoped that the murderer will be arrested and brought to justice soon, the content of this case can be revealed, and the citizens of China and foreign countries can live and work in peace and contentment. However, in this autumn of national crisis, I deeply hope that the people will flash the serious state of national crisis, follow the correct path of patriotism and saving the country, and obey the entire policy of the Central Government. Those who disregard the overall situation, violate the repeated instructions of the Central and local governments, and engage in actions that harm the country in the name of saving the country, the Municipal Government will enforce the law strictly and will never tolerate them.</p>
<p>Reward for the Arrest of the Murderer</p>
<p>The Municipal Government believes that the case has occurred for several days and has not been solved, so it issued a strict order to the Public Security Bureau yesterday to offer a reward for the arrest of the murderer. The original order of the Municipal Government is copied as follows: The case of the Japanese resident Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo being robbed and killed near Dusiwei Road and Qimei Road on the 10th of this month has been strictly ordered by the Bureau to arrest the murderer in this case quickly and carefully protect the Japanese residents in the case. It has been three days since the evening of the incident. The results of the investigation have not yet been reported. A reward should be set up to arrest the murderer as soon as possible. The reward is as follows: The police detective who leads the team to arrest the murderer and accurately confirms the information will be rewarded with 2,000 national currency. The person who knows the news and reports it, thus arresting the murderer and accurately confirming the information, will be rewarded with 1,000 national currency. The Bureau should immediately comply with and report it. This order, July 13, 1936.</p>
<p>Special Team Handling</p>
<p>After the Municipal Public Security Bureau received the strict order from the Municipal Government to investigate and arrest the murderer, it immediately gathered its cadres in the bureau to set up a special team to handle this case. Day and night, they engaged in investigation, interrogation, and evidence collection. In the section near the road built across the border, where there are many Japanese residents, the Public Security Bureau has also added patrol police to travel back and forth to provide protection.</p>
<h3>The Three-Nation Goods Group Gave a Farewell Banquet Last Night for the Nanyang Inspection Team and Requested Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team, organized by the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, has been fully prepared since its inception. The group of fifteen people, with over two hundred boxes of goods, is led by the head of the delegation, Mr. Gao Shiheng. They are scheduled to depart on the 16th aboard the "Tjipanoek" of the Java Mailboat Company. Last night, the United Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories of this city, the Shanghai National Goods Movement Association, and the National Goods Production and Sales Association jointly hosted a farewell banquet for the team at the Jinlong Hotel, and invited Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries to give instructions. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose of the Trip: According to Mr. Gao Shiheng, the head of the delegation, in an interview with the Central News Agency, Chinese trade is lagging behind. To seek development, the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team was formed. Its purpose is to investigate the commercial conditions in various parts of Nanyang as a basis for development, to establish national goods companies in major ports in Nanyang, and to strive to improve the quality and manufacturing methods of national goods in preparation for foreign trade. The expenses for this trip are five boxes, which will be distributed by over thirty factories and exhibited in various ports in Nanyang in turn.</p>
<p>Government Support: Overseas Chinese have high expectations for national goods. Because China has had very little export trade in the past, it has been difficult for overseas Chinese to purchase them. The commercial responsibility of this delegation is very heavy. It is hoped that it will achieve considerable results so that it can move forward step by step in the future. This morning (that is, yesterday morning), I visited Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries and reported everything, which was met with great concern. On the evening of the 14th, I will go to Beijing with Chairman Zhang Huikang of the Association to ask for instructions, and it has been decided to depart on the 16th for a period of three months.</p>
<p>List of Team Members:</p>
<p>The delegation consists of fifteen people. The list is as follows: Head of the delegation Gao Shiheng (Meiya Silk Weaving Factory), Deputy Head Hu Shicheng (Huachang Steel Refined Factory), General Affairs Zhang Zuyin (Washeng Electric Appliance Factory), Accountant Zhuang Maoru (Family Industry Cooperative), Public Relations Xu Xuejie (China Chemical Industry Cooperative), Secretary Yang Chong, Li Shenyan (Xingye Ceramic Tile Company), Lu Zixian (Meiya Silk Weaving Factory), Deng Qiyao (Yonggu Paint Manufacturing Company), Xu Zhaolin (Yakang Sock Factory), Jiang Junrui (Sino-French Pharmacy), Gao Juxin (Forest Rattan Willow Straw Utensil Factory), Zhou Guojun (Tianyuan MSG Factory), Wang Gongquan (Tianxiangweibao Factory), Zhu Qizu (Kangyuan Biscuit Factory, will join in Singapore), etc., a group of fifteen people, representing more than thirty factories.</p>
<p>Inspection Schedule: The delegation has now received many welcoming telegrams from overseas Chinese groups in various parts of Nanyang. The inspection locations are designated as Manila, Surabaya, Batavia, Singapore, Penang, and Siam. If time and funds are sufficient, they will go to Medan. The schedule is as follows: Depart from Shanghai on July 16th, arrive in Little Luzon on July 23rd, stay for 14 days, leave Little Luzon on August 6th, arrive in Surabaya on August 13th, stay for 7 days, leave Surabaya on August 20th, arrive in Batavia on August 20th, stay for 10 days, leave Batavia on August 31st, arrive in Singapore on September 31st, stay for 12 days, leave Singapore on September 16th, arrive in Penang on September 16th, stay for 5 days, leave Penang on September 22nd, arrive in Siam on September 23rd, stay for 10 days, leave Bangkok on October 3rd, arrive in Singapore on October 15th, stay for 10 days, leave Singapore on October, arrive in Hong Kong on October 22nd, and return to Shanghai on October 26th.</p>
<p>Farewell Last Night: The Shanghai National Goods Movement Association, the United Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, and the National Goods Production and Sales Association hosted a farewell banquet for the delegation at the Jinlong Hotel at 7 p.m. last night and invited Minister Wu Dingchang of the Ministry of Industries to give instructions. Guests included Minister Wu, Hu Xiyuan, Zhi Xue, Xiang Hongchang, Xu Ruoruo, Lu Qianyi, Chu Yaoyao, Wang Xingyao, Cheng Shouzhong, Ren Shigang, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhang Huikang, Zhang Zuyin, Yang Chongxun, Zhu Bochen, Pan Yangyao, Gu Yixin, Youcai, Zhang Shenzhi, Li Kangnian, Sun Daosheng, Huang Renzhi, Chen Junwu, Gao Shiheng, Qi Yangnan, Xu Xuejie, Li Shenyan, Wang Gongquan, Gao Juxin, Deng Qiyao, Lu Boyu, Xu Xiaochu, Jiang Junrui, Hu Shicheng, Zhuang Maoru, Tang Qiongxiang, and more than thirty other people. Hu Xiyuan, Wang Xingyao, and Cheng Zongzhong formed the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Hu Xiyuan rose to give a speech, stating that the three associations of this city jointly hosted a farewell banquet for the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team, and invited Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries to come and give instructions. The national goods business in our country has made considerable efforts in recent years. The delegation has a very important mission on this trip. To develop national goods, we must first understand the needs of the outside world and seek overseas promotion. The purpose of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team is to introduce national products to overseas Chinese in various places to comfort their ardent hopes.</p>
<p>Minister Wu's Speech: Minister Wu Dingchang gave instructions, stating that the members of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team are striving for their careers and are admirable. Thirty years ago, Chinese businessmen occupied a considerable position in the international arena, but later gradually declined, almost to the point of being unable to recover. The reason for this is that Chinese businessmen only knew how to struggle individually and could not unite, and were therefore unable to compete with others, leading to lagging behind. It is rare for domestic businessmen to form an inspection team to go to Nanyang for inspection in our country, but compared with advanced countries, it is still far behind. However, although the inspection team is behind, it is better than sitting still and doing nothing. The plan for now is to hope that all factory merchants will unite, concentrate their strength, and seek common development, learn from the backwardness of national goods, strive forward, and move forward step by step. Huang Renzhi and others also gave speeches, and the banquet ended at about nine o'clock.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation to Change Flight Times on All Routes Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The business of China National Aviation Corporation is developing and thriving. There is a shortage of supply for all routes. The company has specifically ordered Douglas aircraft to participate in the Yangtze River route flights to meet demand, and has also expanded all routes. It is reported that except for the Shanghai-Guangdong route, which will remain the same, the remaining Yangtze River route and Shanghai-Ping routes will all change flight times starting tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Contemporary Figures</h3>
<p>Chen Guangfu: Chen Guangfu, General Manager of Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and Gu Jigao, Counselor of the Executive Yuan, who were sent to the United States to discuss currency issues, arrived in Shanghai on the 11th noon aboard the "Bosdam" liner. They were originally scheduled to take the night train to Beijing on the 12th to meet with President Chiang and Minister Kong to report the results of the talks in the United States. It is now learned that due to matters in Shanghai, they will take the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Ping plane at 7 a.m. on the 13th. It is reported that Chen and Guo will stay in Beijing for two or three days and then return to Shanghai to cancel their leave.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui: Dr. Wang Chonghui, member of the Central Supervisory Committee, went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. According to Wang's secretary, Xiao Jinfang, he received a telegram from Wang stating that if there are no special circumstances in Beijing, he will return to Shanghai on the 15th to continue treating his nasal disease. Because the previous X-ray examination results showed that the inside was not completely clean and there was a risk of further ulceration, he still needs to continue treatment in order to fully recover.</p>
<p>Wu Dingchang: Minister Wu Dingchang of the Ministry of Industries arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night express train from Beijing. It is reported that Wu's trip was because the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Team organized by the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association is about to go abroad for inspection, which is of great importance to the development of national goods, so he came to Shanghai specifically to give instructions to the team.</p>
<p>Yang Dezhao: Yang Dezhao, Chen Jitang's representative in Beijing, is currently ill in Shanghai. According to his family, Yang has been feeling unwell for several days, staying at home to recuperate, and has invited a doctor for treatment. He has no intention of leaving Shanghai recently, and the date of his entry into Beijing has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>The Su-Zhe Railway Bondholders' Association Telegraphs the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce for Assistance; Please Telegraph the Ministry of Railways to Oppose Discounted Repayment; Will Not Cease Until the Principal and Interest Are Fully Repaid</h3>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Railways' allocation of 800,000 yuan from the new Huhangyong loan to repay the 1,580,000 yuan of previous Su-Zhe Railway shares and debts, the Su-Zhe Railway Bondholders' Association believes that the Ministry of Railways' rash announcement of discounted repayment, disregarding the original debts, greatly affects the interests of the bondholders. In order to jointly maintain creditor's rights, it once sent personnel to Hangzhou to consult with the bondholders, and the results were unanimously opposed. They also appealed to various organizations and groups, vowing not to rest until the principal and interest are fully repaid. It is reported that Jin Shifan, Wang Weigao, Chen Shangpei, Gao Shenxing, and others, holders of the Zhejiang Railway Company's bonds, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting permission to telegraph the Ministry of Railways to fight for their rights. The original text is as follows: (Titles omitted) The report states that the Ministry of Railways has announced the reorganization of the former Zhejiang Railway Company's bonds and the repayment of principal and interest, and the discount repayment method it has set is difficult to accept. These bonds were originally needed for the urgent completion of the Yong section at that time. Bondholders and others responded with patriotism and love for the railway, investing their daily sweat and blood. According to the history of the Zhejiang Railway, they were the ones who contributed to the initial establishment and maintenance. Now that the Zhejiang Railway is operating with huge annual profits, the government has profits, and employees have bonuses, while bondholders' principal and interest have been suspended for eighteen years, and the losses are already not small. Now, they are repaying by discounting the securities, causing the initial founders and maintainers to bear huge losses alone, which is unreasonable, insensitive, and detrimental to the national credit. We have always admired your association's efforts to protect merchants' rights without reservation. In addition to organizing a bondholders' association and issuing a notice, we specifically request that your association promptly telegraph the Ministry of Railways to fight for our rights, and we vow not to rest until our mission is completed, awaiting your command.</p>

<h3>The Farmers Bank of China Relieves Various Counties in Border Provinces</h3>
<p>The Farmers Bank of China was established to revive agriculture and rural areas, and is endowed with the right of issuance by the government. All banknotes of the bank are allowed to be used in the same way as the legal currency of the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and it is designated to focus on helping the rural economy in remote provinces and regions such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Therefore, the bank has established branch banks or offices in these provinces and regions to handle agricultural loan business, which has been quite effective. It is now learned that President Chiang has ordered the bank to allocate 200,000 yuan as soon as possible to handle loans and relieve the victims, because the counties of Longshan, Laifeng, Enshi, and others on the border of Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan have suffered greatly from the banditry, and the people's production is in extreme distress. After receiving the order, the bank has instructed the branch banks in the respective areas to engage in handling production loans to provide relief.</p>
<h3>New Rice Is Prone to Mold and Cannot Be Stored; Rice Prices Fall Back; A Drop of Seven Corners in the Last Two Weeks; The Opening Market This Morning Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Rice prices in this port have tended to fall back. In the past two weeks, it has fallen from a high of twelve yuan to eleven yuan slightly. The reason is that the current rice stock in Shanghai is still sufficient, the market is soft, and it is the mold season. The new rice cannot withstand storage, so people are rushing to sell. The opening rice prices in the northern market this morning are summarized as follows: Changbang White Glutinous Rice (i.e., Special Grade No. 1 Rice) highest eleven yuan three corners, lowest ten yuan, Thin Rice highest ten yuan seven corners per stone, lowest ten yuan one corner, Bian Yuan (i.e., Sticky Rice) highest ten yuan seven corners per stone, lowest ten yuan four corners.</p>

The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretary Zhang Yuliang, and fourteen others. Chairman Li Dachao and Recorder Chen Shuo made a report, stating that various sectors enthusiastically support the city's fundraising to purchase aircraft to present to the government in commemoration of Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. The Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association has resolved to collect 100,000 yuan from donations from the industry and has appointed nine fundraising committee members to form the industry association's aircraft purchase committee, formulate simple regulations, and rules for the donation collection, and forward them to the Municipal Government for approval and filing, and issue a notice. The association will assist this action, so as to complete its mission as soon as possible. In addition, the Ningbo Association plans to raise 100,000 yuan to purchase aircraft. The Ningbo people in Shanghai discussed the methods of proceeding the night before last, issuing a notice to fellow villagers and raising 2,000 yuan as the full amount, and setting up rewards and collection banks, and appointing committee members to handle the matter. The association will also assist its authority. After the external secretary reported the negotiation process, the meeting discussed the fundraising plan for the future, and adjourned at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Various Circles of Anti-Smuggling Association Request Wang Xiaolai and Others to Take Office; Executive Committee Meeting Scheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The various circles of the city's Anti-Smuggling Association yesterday sent letters to the elected committee members, including Wang Xiaolai and Du Yuesheng, stating: "We hereby inform you that the Association's purpose is to assist the government in combating smuggling, safeguard tax revenues, and revive commerce and industry. Since the formal establishment of the Executive Committee through the joint meeting of various organizations, the first Executive Committee meeting was held on July 8th to allocate responsibilities.

We respectfully request that you accept this position and work together to promote our cause. Furthermore, to advance the Association's work, a special first Executive Committee meeting is scheduled for 2 PM tomorrow at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce meeting room to discuss important matters. It is also understood that the Association's operating expenses require funding. Yesterday, based on the Executive Committee's resolution, separate letters were sent to various organizations requesting financial assistance to facilitate its operations. The original letter stated: 'We hereby inform you that the Association's purpose is to assist the government in combating smuggling, safeguard tax revenues, and revive commerce and industry. Since the formal establishment of the Executive Committee through the joint meeting of various organizations, the first Executive Committee meeting was held on July 8th to appoint Standing Committee Members and Department Heads to actively work. Regarding the necessary funding, it was resolved that each organization would undertake to contribute (with a minimum of five yuan). This matter concerns public assistance in combating smuggling to maintain market stability. We respectfully request your organization to provide financial assistance to facilitate our operations. We earnestly hope for your support.'"</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks Ministry of Finance to Ban Smuggled Cigarette Paper</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, noting the discovery of smuggled cigarette paper in Shanghai, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report the situation and request measures to prevent and stop it. The telegram read: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 11th of this month, according to a letter from the Paper Trade Association, since rampant smuggling has prevailed in North China, smuggled cigarette paper has been discovered in Shanghai. As a result, the domestically produced cigarette paper of our member, Minfeng Paper Mill, cannot be fully sold. Although no smuggled goods of other papers have yet been discovered, in the past four months, the sales volume of our members' paper shipped to North China has decreased by 60% compared to previous years. Areas within the Jinpu and Longhai Railways, such as the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, are the most prosperous regions for our paper sales in the north. However, since the rampant smuggling, the sales of both domestically produced and Western paper in these areas have almost completely ceased. Furthermore, large commercial ports along the Yangtze River have also experienced the intrusion of smuggled goods, which will severely impact the entire operation of our industry. Moreover, currently, the small quantities of foreign and domestically produced paper that our members ship to various places are often mistakenly identified as smuggled goods by the anti-smuggling offices, resulting in frequent detentions. We have reluctantly appointed a specialist to review and inspect paper samples batch by batch, investigate whether taxes have been paid, and issue certificates after confirming that they are not smuggled goods. However, the procedure is cumbersome, and our members find it inconvenient. Cigarette paper is mainly sold to mechanized cigarette factories. Formal cigarette factories have rules and restrictions on the purchase of cigarette paper, with strict audits. However, home-made cigarettes are very scattered, and some may risk purchasing smuggled goods in violation of regulations. Based on the aforementioned information, we request that your ministry instruct the relevant authorities to devise thorough fundamental auditing measures to prevent smuggled cigarette paper from gaining a foothold in Shanghai. As the association stated, the area within the Jinpu and Longhai Railway lines is almost entirely affected by smuggling. Although this only applies to the paper industry, other industries can be inferred similarly. We request that your ministry instruct the Anti-Smuggling General Office to deploy strictly and increase anti-smuggling forces at the important stations along these two railway lines. The import licenses originally specified various imported foreign goods listed by your ministry. However, now, domestic and foreign goods are often not distinguished, which may lead to potential abuses and fail to effectively stop smuggling. Instead, it may hinder the circulation of domestic products. We also request that your ministry devise simple and appropriate measures to avoid harassment. This would be most fortunate. Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Reporting of Opium Smokers to Be Completed by Deadline; Unregistered Smokers to Be Prosecuted; Public Security Bureau Issues Final Notice for Opium Smokers to Come to Their Senses; Commissioner's Office Scheduled to Close at the End of August</h3>
<p>The deadline for the registration and reporting of opium smokers in this city is fast approaching. In addition to continuing to implement strict reporting measures, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to issue another reminder. The details obtained by the Dagong News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>Opium Smoker Registration Deadline Approaching</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, having begun the general registration and reporting of opium smokers on May 10th of this year, in accordance with the order of the Military Affairs Commission, has reached the two-month mark to date. The originally set three-month deadline will soon expire next month (August) on the 10th. In the past two months, the Anti-Drug Commissioner's Office of the Anti-Opium General Office of the Military Affairs Commission stationed in Shanghai has been actively assisting and supervising the Municipal Public Security Bureau in implementing the reporting measures. A significant number of opium smokers in the city who had previously failed to register and obtain licenses have voluntarily reported themselves.</p>
<p>Strict Reporting Urges Awareness</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has found that a considerable number of people within its jurisdiction are evading registration. In addition to continuing to implement strict reporting measures according to the established reporting plan, it will issue reminders to those few opium smokers who still refuse to register within this final month, urging them to finally repent. After the 10th of next month, all opium smokers who fail to register by the deadline will be arrested and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for prosecution in accordance with the Interim Regulations on the Punishment of Drug Offenses, without any leniency.</p>
<p>Commissioner Ma Liang Returns to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Liang, Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Anti-Opium and Opium Smoker Registration Commissioner, reported to the Military Affairs Commission in Beijing on the 10th to report on the situation of the anti-opium administration in Shanghai. According to sources from the Commissioner's Office, Mr. Ma has completed his official business in Beijing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today to work with the Municipal Government to negotiate the transfer of anti-opium administrative power in the concessions, with the aim of achieving a resolution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Office to Close at the End of August</p>
<p>According to information obtained by the Dagong News Agency reporter, the establishment of the Anti-Drug Commissioner's Office was originally temporary. As the reporting of opium smokers in this city will conclude on the 10th of next month, the office's mission will also be completed at the same time. Therefore, it is scheduled to close at the end of August and report to the Military Affairs Commission.</p>

<h3>Hopeful That This Year May Be Spared From Cholera; As It Is Already Mid-July And No Cases Have Occurred; Highest Summer Temperature Was 97.2 Degrees; 350,000 People Have Been Inoculated Against Cholera</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office issued its second announcement yesterday, stating: "Since the publication of the first announcement on June 3rd, the health authorities of this port have been closely monitoring the signs of cholera. All summer gastrointestinal illnesses have been subjected to examination and stool bacteria testing. Now that it is mid-July, this terrible disease has not yet occurred, which is encouraging. If no cases are found by the end of this month, then the remaining days of summer are few, and we may even be able to pass through safely. In Asia, only two major cities have continuously experienced cholera outbreaks. One is Calcutta, India, which reported 15 cases per week starting from January 4th of this year, and as many as 268 cases per week by May 16th. By July 4th, this had decreased to 52 cases. The other is Bangkok, Siam, which reported 15 cases per week on January 4th of this year, increasing to 60 cases by February 29th, and then gradually decreasing. On July 4th, there were still 6 cases. On average, the cases in the cholera risk areas this year are not numerous. The cold and damp period this spring was very long. Since the beginning of summer, it has suddenly turned hot. The temperature was 95.2 degrees on the 1st of this month, 96.6 degrees on the 9th, and even hotter on the 11th, reaching 97.2 degrees. Humidity has also fluctuated. It was 88 on the 1st of this month, rising to 100 on the 4th and 5th. Last summer, the highest temperature was 100.8 degrees on July 14th, and the highest humidity was 98 on July 1st and 12th. Regarding cholera prevention, clean water supply, vaccination, food management, fly eradication, and personal hygiene are essential. However, housing issues are also very important and should not be overlooked. If the poor lack access to sanitation and cannot live and work in a hygienic environment, they will not be able to understand the way to health and will still use ditch water for washing rice, vegetables, and utensils. To improve this situation, the Mayor of Shanghai has built four model civilian villages in the city over the past three years, each with a plaza for recreation. The rent for the houses ranges from three to four yuan per month and is rented to the working class. One village is located on Zhongshan Road with 330 rooms, one on Pusan Road with 250 rooms, one on Qimei Road with 252 rooms, and one on Damuqiao Road with 158 rooms. The above four locations have a total of 990 rooms, each of which can accommodate at least five people, for a total of about 5,000 people. This number is a small beginning compared to the size of Shanghai. It is hoped that other cities will also actively promote this. The health authorities of Shanghai and the two concessions are making efforts to carry out cholera vaccination. The number of people vaccinated by the end of June is listed below, along with last year's numbers for comparison: (A) Number of people vaccinated this year: Shanghai 200,000 (approximate figures for May to June), Public Concession 82,413 (May to June), French Concession 66,039 (May to July 10th), Health Department of the Two Railways Bureau 8,242 (end of May), total 356,694. (B) Number of people vaccinated last year: Shanghai 210,909 (May to June), Public Concession 84,885 (May to June), French Concession 44,890 (April 16th to end of June), Health Department of the Two Railways Bureau 5,594 (April to May), total 346,276."</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital June Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's report for June 1936 states: Number of outpatients: 15,494; Number of newly admitted inpatients: 364; Number of inpatient days: 6,116; Average daily number of people supplied with meals: 453; Number of male suicides: 55; Number of female suicides: 48; Number of emergency surgeries: 318; Number of emergency surgeries for accidental mechanical injuries: 49; Number of patients sent by the Shanghai Public Concession Police: 496; Number of patients sent by the French Concession Police: 59; Number of deliveries: 20. According to the above statistics, it can be seen that the number of outpatients in the summer months is no different from previous years, and has even increased by more than 1,000 compared to May. The number of patients sent by the Shanghai Public Concession Police has also increased by 10%. The most common diseases in June were malaria and typhoid, but more cases of lung disease were also found, which may be due to the hot weather. The most interesting abnormal case was a child whose heart was not on the usual left side but was found on the right side. In recent years, we have seen cases that are practically incurable. It is one of the hospital's urgent tasks to have another location to handle such cases, so that their beds can be used for other emergency, curable patients. For example, our hospital has a patient, Mr. Zhang, who has been in the hospital for five years. If he can continue to survive and the hospital cannot prepare another place for him, then it is conceivable that Mr. Zhang will stay in the hospital for another five years. Although Mr. Zhang is unfortunate and has been plagued by illness for a long time, he is still in a good mood, and his excellent influence has benefited many patients in the same ward. However, if the bed he occupies can be vacated, it can be used for countless other short-term patients.</p>

<h3>Opium Den Busted on Li Mei Road</h3>
<p>Zhao Zhang, a 52-year-old woman from Zhenjiang, is the owner of the Dechang Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 133, Yaxianfang, Huageni Road, French Concession. Since the government has strictly prohibited opium and drugs, she has taken the opportunity to secretly set up a morphine injection den at No. 16, Jixiangfang, Li Mei Road, specializing in providing injections to lower-class addicts. Recently, it was discovered by French Concession police detective Ni Xiafei. At 9 PM the day before yesterday, he first went to No. 16, Jixiangfang, Li Mei Road, and arrested injection assistant Chen Daomin (42 years old, from Haimen) and customer Yu Wanrong (36 years old, from Yangzhou). Thirteen small packets of morphine, one morphine needle, two needle heads, one glass tube, and ninety copper coins in cash were confiscated. They were taken to the police station. Zhao Zhang was then arrested at the Dechang Tobacco and Paper Shop on Huageni Road, but she had already fled upon hearing the news and was not caught. Only one large packet of morphine, weighing three taels, and nine small packets were confiscated. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted the preliminary hearing. The police attorney prosecuted based on Articles 259 and 262 of the Criminal Law, and the confiscated evidence was presented to the court. After the court questioned the defendants, they were ordered to be remanded for further questioning at a later date. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Taikang Company Discovers Counterfeit Biscuits; Sues in Court for Losses</h3>
<p>Taikang Biscuit and Canned Food Company of this port discovered in May of this year that someone was counterfeiting its Rooster Brand, Pistol Brand, and Tank Brand biscuits, which have been registered and patented by the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and selling them in the market, which greatly affected its business. It then issued a warning in the newspaper and sent people to investigate closely. The day before yesterday, it was discovered that Huatongchangji Food Company at No. 103, Wier Meng Road, French Concession, was privately manufacturing the above three trademarked foods, profiting by deception. Zhu Qinhuai (26 years old, from Ningbo), manager of the Taikang Company branch at Nos. 566 and 568, Xiafei Road, French Concession, reported to the French Concession Police. Police detectives Qin Youyu and Zuo Qihong were immediately dispatched to Huatongchangji Food Company, disguised as customers, to purchase the above three types of biscuits. The company manager, Zheng Yanling (resident of No. 48, Chengqingli, Baier Road), was arrested, and four large cans of counterfeit biscuits, weighing 160 catties, and three sets of molds were confiscated and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Qiu Huan'ying conducted the trial. Police attorney Fei Xizhen explained the case and prosecuted the defendant for harming agriculture, industry, and commerce under Article 253 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff, Qinhuai, recounted the previous events and appointed attorney Wang Henggu to file an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for losses of 21,600 yuan. According to him, the plaintiff company sells 12,000 catties of biscuits every day. Since the defendant's counterfeiting, business has been greatly affected, with the price dropping from 18 yuan to 16 yuan per 100 catties. Calculated at two cents, the daily loss is 240 yuan, and the total loss for three months is 21,600 yuan. The court verified the statements, questioned the defendant, ordered the opening of the debate, declared the conclusion, and scheduled the verdict for the 20th.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Slash Laborers; Dispute Arises During Cool Evening Gathering</h3>
<p>Chen Longcai and Wang Yuanhe, both around 30 years old from Anhui, are laborers at various wharves in Nanshi. Chen lives in the Tiger Stove in Fuyu Garden, Kaitaili, Fengji Wharf, Nanshi, and Wang lives at No. 10 in the same neighborhood. Around 11 PM the night before, Chen and Wang were cooling off at the entrance when they suddenly had a verbal dispute with Xu Jinfang, a local gangster. People intervened and dissuaded them at the time, and Xu left in a huff. Unexpectedly, around 10 AM yesterday, Xu invited more than a dozen accomplices, each wielding a sharp axe, and gathered at the entrance of the Changchunlou Teahouse at the Pig Row Wharf, waiting. Before long, Chen and Wang arrived and were attacked with axes by the throng of gangsters, throwing the two to the ground and slashing them indiscriminately. As a result, Wang suffered four axe wounds to the back of the head, right hand, and right leg, while Chen suffered three axe wounds to the back, left, and right sides. By the time the nearby police officers arrived, only one accomplice, Zhao Fusheng, was caught, while the rest fled without a trace. Chen and Wang were rushed to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and it is reported that their injuries are quite serious and life-threatening.</p>

<h3>Missing Japanese National Swimmer, Kamei, Found</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 12th) afternoon, four members of the Japanese Domei News Agency went to Takahashi Beach to swim. Among them was Mr. Kamei, who swam alone to the deep water outside the buoy. At that time, a strong wind and large waves struck. He was fatigued midway while swimming back and raised his hand for help. Many lifeguards at the beach and a Westerner, Mr. Aruonoli, and others rushed to rescue him. When they were almost reaching the Japanese national, they were suddenly hit by a huge wave, causing him to drown. The beach rescue motorboat, having seen another yacht capsizing in the distance earlier, had set out to rescue it. En route, it was stranded by the waves, and the engine was suddenly damaged, making it unable to move to rescue him. Afterwards, the Japanese national's companions reported to the local Public Security Branch Police Station and the Japanese Consulate General. The Takahashi Branch ordered the police to work with the beach staff to find the body. It was found at 10:35 AM yesterday (the 13th). Takahashi Branch Director Tang then reported to the Public Security Bureau and the Japanese Consulate General. The Public Security Bureau dispatched Clerk Wang and Branch Director Tang to escort the Japanese national's body to the Japanese Consulate General. Branch Director Tang borrowed vehicles and boats to quickly transport it to Shanghai. It is reported that it was delivered to the Japanese Consul General at 4:50 PM that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Swapping Prizes with Counterfeit Cigarette Packs; Arrested; Tobacco Shop Owner Also Detained</h3>
<p>The Company Brand cigarettes produced by Ruilun Tobacco Company at No. 9, Lane 150, Kaifeng Road, can be redeemed for household items if a complete set of empty packs and wrappers are collected. Major tobacco shops also act as redemption points. At 11 PM the night before, Tian Kunzhen, a 17-year-old from Zhenjiang, brought twenty empty packs of the Company Brand to Chengchang Tobacco Shop at No. 149, Xinwen Road, intending to redeem them for a prize. Chengchang Shop assistant Yi Fan, seeing that the empty packs were very suspicious, asked Tian to go to the Ruilun Company for verification. After inspection by Company Investigator Dong Cai, it was discovered that the paper of the empty packs was inconsistent and that the patterns on the side of the packs had been added. It was clear that they were counterfeit. The company reported to the Huisi Police Station, ordering the detectives to arrest Tian. Forty more similar packs were found in his pocket. Under questioning, Tian confessed that he was an apprentice at Wanshun Tobacco Shop at No. 174, Xinqiao Street, French Concession. The empty packs were entrusted to him by the shop owner, Cai Hechun, to be redeemed. A fellow apprentice at the same shop, She Weiqing, had redeemed over 300 packs. The detectives, together with detectives from the French Concession Police, went to arrest Cai and She, who were temporarily detained by the French Concession Police. Yesterday morning, Tian was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Ruilun Tobacco Company also engaged attorney Tang Mingshi to appear in court to file an incidental civil lawsuit. Police attorney Qian Xunjiu explained the previous events and requested that, since the two criminals Cai and She were still detained at the French Concession Police Station, a letter be issued to transfer them. Therefore, the case was temporarily not prosecuted. Only permission for [illegible word, possibly "detention"] was requested. It was also stated that, according to the defendant's confession at the police station, these cigarette packs were received from others for less than one copper coin per pack, while the Company Brand cigarette packs were worth about one cent each. Judge Ye Shengchao asked Tian Kunzhen briefly and approved the [illegible word, possibly "detention"] and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Transient, Mobile Gambling Ring; Multiple Arrests on the Bund; Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Due to the strict prohibition by the police and the arrest and imprisonment of various organizers, the gambling ring business is not as prosperous as it once was. Currently, only Qian Ajin is still operating, but its organization is not as grand as before. Each gambling session is no longer held indoors but on the roadside, and it is constantly moving. Recently, it was discovered that gambling sessions were held in the French Concession, and many people were arrested by the French Concession Police. The gambling ring then moved to the Bund on Wuma Road in the Public Concession, and a large number of ships were dispatched to collect gambling funds from various places, opening the lightest form of gambling. This was discovered by Chief Inspector Su Changsheng, detectives Jiang Shangpei and Bao Tan Yep Chuanxi of the General Patrol Room's Chinese division. At 9 AM on the 11th of this month, they went to the Bund on Guangdong Road, together with Western detectives, and arrested Liu Sifu (also known as Gui Sheng) from Nanjing, Fei Xirong from Suzhou, Chen Yongchang from Shaoxing, Yang Changgen, Shen Heshang and Chen Qingyun from Hangzhou, Sun Aqian and Zhou Amao from Suzhou, and eight others. Gambling ring slips and gambling funds were seized. The organizers Qian Ajin, Qian Ayu, Wang Bingdi, Shao Jinsheng, Wang Asan, and Ayuan all escaped. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the arrested criminals to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police attorney Jiang Baokang prosecuted them under Article 268 and Article 30 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Huang Daxi, they were ordered to be remanded and await sentencing at a later date.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing Silk Firm Apprentice Steals Relief Funds and Flees to Shanghai; Swallows Pills Upon Arrest, but Fortunately Consumed Little and is Unharmed</h3>
<p>Shen Zhenshen, a 24-year-old native of Jiaxing, was employed as a relief fund officer at the Xie Shou Xiang silk firm owned by Huang Zuoqing in Puyuan Town, Jiaxing. On the 10th of this month, Huang Zuoqing, upon reviewing the financial records, discovered that Shen had engaged in fraudulent activities. Huang ordered Shen to prepare a detailed list for verification. Unexpectedly, Shen, driven by vanity and fear of losing his position, fled to Shanghai, hiding in the home of his relative, Shen Liangshen, at No. 4679, Shenderi, Route Robert, in the Public Concession. Huang Zuoqing, after discovering his whereabouts, tracked him down to Shanghai the day before yesterday, going directly to Shenderi, Route Robert to await his arrival. At about 9 p.m., Shen Zhenshen indeed arrived and was seized. Upon questioning, Shen admitted to embezzling 670 yuan from the firm and implicated five other employees in the fraudulent scheme. Huang then went outside and summoned Chinese constables Nos. 163 and 464. Unexpectedly, Shen at this moment swallowed sleeping pills, intending to commit suicide. He was taken to the Putuo Road police station and later transferred to Renji Hospital. Fortunately, he had not taken many pills, and after treatment, he recovered and was taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the details of the case, stating that the incident occurred in Renjiawei, and requested instructions. According to Huang Zuoqing's complaint regarding the discovery of Shen Zhenshen's fraudulent activities, he had not filed a lawsuit in the Jiaxing court due to time constraints. He now requested permission to escort Shen back to Jiaxing Court for prosecution and to dispatch personnel to collect him. Upon questioning, Shen Zhenshen confessed that he had personally embezzled a total of 1,200 yuan in relief funds in installments. Judge Huang Risheng, upon reviewing the confession, ordered Shen to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery Shooting: Chen Jiusheng Dies; Corpse Claimed by Friend for Examination</h3>
<p>Chen Jiusheng, a 24-year-old native of Pudong, was the manager of the Xie Yu Cleaning Company (contracted by the Public Works Department for sanitation matters). At 9:55 a.m. on the 10th of this month, he and the company's accountant, Zhu Zhongkang, were traveling by car with 917 yuan in cash, intending to distribute wages to workers at the Binlang Road and Mazaki Road branch offices. Their plan was discovered by bandits, and two robbers, one armed with a handgun, ambushed the company entrance. When Chen's car arrived, the robbers stepped forward to seize 800 yuan in cash. The armed robber shot Chen in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground injured. The robbers fled the scene. After receiving a report, the Gordon Road police dispatched detectives to investigate. Chen was rushed to Shilong Hospital for treatment, but he died at 1:20 a.m. the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the forensic examination center on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. According to Zhu Zhongkang's testimony, he was 30 years old, a native of Jiading, and worked as an accountant for the cleaning company. On the day of the incident, he and the deceased were traveling by car to the branch office to distribute wages. He got out of the car first and entered the company. Therefore, he only heard a gunshot and did not witness the robbery or the shooting of Chen. Xi Xinyi testified that he was a colleague and friend of the deceased. Since Chen's family had not yet arrived, he volunteered to claim the body. Prosecutor Zhang concluded that the deceased Chen Jiusheng, male, had indeed died from a gunshot wound inflicted by robbers while alive. The body was released to his friend, Xi Xinyi, upon signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Franco-Chinese Pharmacy Holds Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Franco-Chinese Pharmacy held its shareholders' meeting yesterday at the Yizhi Xiang Cai Club. 107 shareholders, representing 20,927 shares, attended. Chairman Chu Minyi reported on the number of shareholders and shares present. He noted that the recent global economic downturn and stagnation in various industries had not prevented the company from thriving in the 24th fiscal year due to the efforts of General Manager Ma, Manager Xu, Factory Director Zhou, and all employees. Manager Xu Xiaochu reported on the business situation, stating that sales had increased compared to the 23rd fiscal year, while expenses had decreased. Although the progress was not as rapid as before, this was a common impact on all industries after the September 18th Incident. The company had always focused on promoting its own brand of medicines, so the number of products had increased year by year. Sales of products such as Ai Wei Brain Tonic, Ai Luo Lung Medicine, 914 Liquid, and Ointment had increased compared to previous years, and new products such as Weiningning, Mietong, Luo Weisha'er, Luo Wei Emulsified Cod Liver Oil, and Xiang Brand Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil were also thriving. General Manager Ma Bingxun reported on the distribution of this year's profits. It was decided that the date for issuing official interest would be determined by the board of directors and announced later. One-third of the directors and supervisors were re-elected. The directors whose terms had not yet expired were Chu Minyi, Zhou Mengbai, Guo Xuanqian, and Fan Hefu. Wang Chengde, Zhang Shuliang, Ge Yongsheng, and Shu Changqi were appointed to count the ballots. As a result, Zhu Yicai, Lu Feibo Hong, Chen Hening, and Dong Jifu were elected as directors, with Xu Bincai and Gao Peiliang as alternates. Chen Xingwu, Zhu Yifu, and Gu Zanza Chen were elected as supervisors, with Ge Yongsheng and Yao Jiarong as alternates. Each shareholder was given daily necessities such as eau de cologne, mosquito repellent incense, Rendan, and a paper pad, and the meeting ended on a happy note.</p>

<h3>Central Savings Society to Hold Lottery Drawing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Central Savings Society has held three lottery drawings since its opening, and all special prizes of 25,000 yuan have been fully guaranteed by the society. The fourth lottery drawing will be held publicly at the City Chamber of Commerce tomorrow (the 15th) at 2 p.m. The special prize of 25,000 yuan will be guaranteed by the society. According to regulations, half a yuan is drawn from each membership to calculate the value of the special prize, so there must be 50,000 memberships to reach 25,000 yuan. Although the number of membership cards included in this drawing does not reach 50,000, the special prize will still be 25,000 yuan, so more than 10,000 yuan must be supplemented. In addition to the special prize, there are also a first prize of 2,000 yuan, a second prize of 300 yuan, a third prize of 200 yuan, and a fourth prize of 100 yuan, each with nine winners, as well as several consolation prizes. Every ten numbers will have at least one prize. Because the prizes are large and numerous, it is easy to win in the lottery, and depositors are enthusiastically joining the society. After the winning numbers are drawn, they will be broadcast on the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications tomorrow afternoon at 3:30, 5:00, and 6:45 p.m. (frequency 1300). Because there is not enough time to fill out the membership cards, temporary receipts containing the numbers are issued first so that they can be included in this lottery. Therefore, those who wish to save can still pay the society to participate in this month's savings.</p>

<h3>British Sailor Beats Rickshaw Puller to Death</h3>
<p>Forensic Examination Reveals Skull Fracture; Life of a Chinese is Too Pitiful</p>
<p>Chen Huizhang, a 36-year-old native of Yancheng, who lived at No. 2, Jingde Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, worked as a rickshaw puller. At about 3 a.m. on the 8th of this month, while soliciting business in front of the British Seamen's Club on Rue Cardinal Mercier, three sailors from the club, who had just returned from a dance hall on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, suddenly and inexplicably beat Chen to the ground, causing him serious injuries. When the police arrived, they reported the incident to the Xinzha police station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The three sailors were taken back to the police station, and Chen was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 5:45 p.m. on the 12th. The body was taken to the forensic examination center on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuji, etc., arrived at the center. To clarify the cause of death, forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, together with doctors from the Public Works Department, dissected Chen's body and conducted a detailed examination. The examination revealed that Chen's skull was fractured, and he died from the injuries. Prosecutor Zhang then took testimonies from witnesses Li A Si, Zhou Ri Tang, and Chen Xuezhong, all of whom were rickshaw pullers. They stated that they had pulled the three sailors from a dance hall on Avenue Edward VII, but they had gotten out of the rickshaw before reaching the Seamen's Club and had not paid the fare. Therefore, they did not witness the beating until they went back for the fare and saw the deceased already on the ground. Li A Si also claimed that he was also beaten in the left chest by the sailors at the time and showed a plaster on his injury as evidence. Prosecutor Zhang concluded that the deceased Chen Huizhang, male, had indeed died from injuries sustained in a beating while alive. The body was released to Chen's wife, Chen Zhang, upon signing a guarantee. The British sailors who committed the crime should be investigated by the police and dealt with according to the law.</p>

<h3>Car Plunges into River in Pudong; License Plate Retrieved; Owner's Family Tight-Lipped</h3>
<p>At 0:05 a.m. yesterday, a Zilpa car plunged into the Huangpu River at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in the French Concession. The incident has already been briefly reported in this newspaper. After receiving the news, the French police immediately notified the fire brigade to dispatch vehicles to salvage the car, but it was not recovered. It was not until about 3 a.m. that it was salvaged. A black license plate was found on the car, number 5109 in the concession. The car belongs to Ye Wenfu, a Ningbo native residing at No. 98, Zhexing Lane, Ditsville Road. Reporters have repeatedly inquired at Ye's residence, but the family members have been tight-lipped, only saying that the car is a Buick and that they do not currently employ a driver. Ye himself drives the car when needed. When asked how the car drove to the Jinliyuan Wharf, they replied that Ye had gone to a friend's house for a banquet last night (i.e., the night before last), and the car was stolen by someone, causing the accident. However, according to reporters' inquiries from various sources, it is said that although the car appears to be a private black-plated car, it is actually a clandestine taxi.</p>
<h3>Kicked and Then Illuminated with Electric Light; Police Officer's Son Falls into River; Tragedy Amidst Evening Cool</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, according to a report submitted by the Minhang Township Office, which was instructed by the Shanghai County Public Security First Sub-bureau to report for examination. The police officer Yang Dianchen reported that his son Bingsheng, 16 years old, was apprenticing at the Feilong Auto Shop on Jiuguolu in this town. On the evening of the 11th of this month, at about 9 p.m., he went to the railing of the Minhang ferry terminal of the Construction Bureau Highway Management Office to cool off and fell asleep shortly after. However, the ferry manager Zhan Wei Zeng kicked him hard with his leather shoes and shone a 1,500-foot flashlight in his face. After being startled, the child's eyes were violently exposed to the electric light, and he could not distinguish directions, causing him to fall into the river. Zhan did not call for help and left quietly, causing him to drown. The police officer, after hearing the news, rushed to the scene to investigate. Witnesses Li A Fu and Zheng Buyun stated that they were also cooling off at the dock at the same time and witnessed the incident. Zhan denied the facts and claimed that the child died due to fate. The police officer argued with him, which angered Zhan. Zhan then struck the police officer with the flashlight, injuring his wrist. Hearing others say that the flashlight was used to shine on the child, the police officer was even more saddened. The police officer, seeing the object and thinking of his son, was even more grief-stricken, so he snatched the flashlight back. The police officer is over half a century old and only has this one son, and he is the inheritor of three families. The whole family hopes that this son will grow up and inherit the family business. Now, what can the living endure? He recently received a letter from his family saying that his mother is seriously ill and is very concerned about her son. Now that she has heard this bad news in her illness, it is unknown how much grief she will feel. The manager could have woken him up gently, but this tragedy would not have occurred. The manager has indeed committed the crime of causing death by injury. Thinking of this, his heart is broken. He begs the director to ask the court to punish him according to the law and to provide generous compensation. Based on this, he requested the court to dispatch personnel to examine the body. Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia and examiner Shen Qixiu were appointed and arrived at the scene. They found an injury to the deceased's right eye, which confirmed that he had fallen into the river after being injured and had died. The family was ordered to collect the body and await further investigation.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Who Cannot Read Accuses Husband of Fraudulently Obtaining Divorce Agreement; Court Orders Further Hearing After Witnesses Are Subpoenaed</h3>
<p>Chen Qiaogeng, 27 years old, residing at No. 350 Qichang Stock, Pudong, and working as a clerk at Chen Bingji Transportation Company, married Bao Huifen, 23 years old, of No. 331 Lujia Ferry, Pudong, in February of the 21st year of the Republic of China. However, in May of this year, he suddenly produced a mutual consent divorce agreement drafted by attorney Cheng Zhengping. Bao Huifen recently hired a lawyer to sue Chen Qiaogeng for fraudulently obtaining the agreement and requested that the divorce agreement be revoked. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Jikang of the Civil Division of the District Court heard the case in the fourteenth courtroom. Bao Huifen testified, "After marrying Chen Qiaogeng, he disliked me because I couldn't read, so our relationship was not very harmonious. On May 14th of this year, he gave me 500 yuan to go to school and took me to attorney Cheng Zhengping's office on the Fourth Road. He wrote my name and forced me to trace it on four sheets of paper. I thought I was filling out a school application, but unexpectedly, the next day, a public announcement appeared in the newspaper stating that we were divorced. I do not want a divorce, so I am requesting that the divorce agreement be revoked." After speaking, she burst into tears. The judge then questioned Chen Qiaogeng, who testified, "Bao Huifen has always been literate. Because she is very hot-tempered and often goes out, I often advised her, but she would often throw a tantrum and say she wanted a divorce. Therefore, on the morning of May 14th, we first went to attorney Cheng's office to discuss the matter, and in the afternoon, we both went to have the documents stamped. This was a mutual agreement, and we both knew attorney Cheng. Furthermore, my salary is meager; how could I have given her 500 yuan for school expenses? There is no such fact. After the divorce, she took all her belongings. Moreover, the Yangjing Literacy School investigated and found that she claimed to have a primary school education." Bao Huifen then stated, "After going to the lawyer's office, Cheng, Chen Qiaogeng, and his family packed my clothes and belongings into three rickshaws and forced me back to my mother's house. My mother was furious and refused to let me in, so the belongings were sent to the Pudong branch of the police station and only retrieved three days later, which can be investigated." The plaintiff's lawyer added, "All the words 'primary school education' on Bao Huifen's household registration card were written by the defendant; the plaintiff did not know." The defendant's lawyer stated, "Regarding the circumstances of the case, I request that attorney Cheng Zhengping, who handled the divorce, be summoned to testify." The judge ordered that a subpoena be issued, and the case was adjourned for further hearing. The court then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Shanghai East District Slum Dwellers Petitioned Yesterday in Separate Groups</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai East District Lan Road and other slum areas were ordered by the Free Municipal Council to relocate within one month, thousands of slum dwellers were shocked and frightened upon hearing the news. They have specially appointed representatives to submit petitions to all sectors of Shanghai society, requesting assistance to maintain their livelihoods. Yesterday, representatives Sun Hankui, Wang Qitai, Guo Bingzhi, Gu Xuebo, and others petitioned the Municipal Council's Co-Governor He Dekui, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association separately, requesting a temporary postponement of the relocation to maintain their livelihoods. As a result, all parties agreed to convey the message to the Municipal Council. The Council's Works Department and Health Department will temporarily postpone the relocation. On the one hand, they hope that the representatives will inform all slum dwellers to voluntarily improve sanitation to prevent the spread of epidemics.

<h3>Huangpu River to Have a Breakthrough; 12-Foot High Tide; Less Than One Foot from Bund Embankment; Low-Lying Roads Will Inevitably Be Flooded; Date: Morning of the 21st of This Month</h3>
<p>According to the dredging bureau's forecast, there will be a high tide of more than 12 feet in the Huangpu River on the 21st of this month, less than one foot from the 13-foot embankment on the Bund. If there is additional wind, rain, and low pressure, the tide may exceed the predicted height, which deserves attention. The predicted time is recorded below. The high tide on the 21st of this month will begin to rise at 10:49 p.m. on the 20th. The rising trend will accelerate at 1:12 a.m. the next morning, with a water flow rate of 1.4 nautical miles per hour. The tide will reach its peak at 1:47 a.m., with a predicted height of 12 feet and 5 inches. The Bund embankment is 13 feet high. Embankments near the 16th pier are less than 13 feet. Therefore, the high tide on that day will not only cause backflow and flooding on low-lying roads, but also potentially inundate low areas of the embankment.</p>

<p>The Songqing Hall Medical Clinic, located at the west end of Er Ma Road and Shilu Road in this city, was founded by the national physician Mr. Hu Chunxiang. Mr. Hu has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for nearly forty years, and his medical knowledge is profound, especially in internal medicine.

<h3>Yang Jixian Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building; Suspected to Have Been Frightened by Robbers; Corpse Inspected by Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yang Jixian, 44 years old, from Songjiang, opened an oil mill in his hometown and was quite wealthy. Recently, he suffered from a foot ailment, so he came to Shanghai with his son Zhaohua to seek medical treatment. However, on the way to Minhang, he was spotted by bandits, who threatened him with guns. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, Yang reported the incident to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. At 10:40 p.m. on the 12th of this month, Yang suddenly jumped out of the window of room 545 at the Central Hotel on Wu Ma Road, where he was staying. When two of his friends left, the police noticed and immediately summoned an ambulance to rush him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died shortly after and the hospital reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered an investigation. The body was then taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang was dispatched by the Special First Court to inspect the body. According to Chinese Detective Lu Dagong's report of the previous events, Mr. Zhang declared that the deceased, Yang Jixian, male, had committed suicide by jumping from the building and died. The corpse was handed over to the deceased's son, Yang Bohua, who signed an agreement to claim and bury it.</p>
<h3>Traffic Accident on Gonghe Road; Five Men, Women, and Children Injured and Killed</h3>
<p>At around 5:00 p.m. yesterday, a truck with municipal license plate 13430, rental license plate 17180, and freight pass 1094 was traveling on Gonghe Road near the Xiaocai Market in Zhabei. As it passed by, a boy about four or five years old was crossing the road. The driver, trying to avoid him, drove the front of the truck into the entrance of the Wei Dasheng fresh pork shop at No. 78, smashing the meat racks. At the same time, it injured a total of five men, women, and children. The patrol police saw this and arrived, taking the driver to the Xinzha Branch Bureau. The injured were sent to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road. The driver confessed that his name was Shen Wurong, 24 years old, from Xinghua, and that he drove for the Tongde Lane No. 90 on McTaggart Road in the British Concession. Today, he was loading goods from the Yuncheng Lane No. 10 freight room on South Railway Station Branch Road to be delivered to the Yuanyuan Factory on Changan Road. He was traveling west on Gonghe Road from Datong Road when he saw a child in front of him and immediately turned the steering wheel to the left to avoid him, causing the accident. Among the five injured, one boy died before medical treatment could be administered. The parents of the deceased child identified him as Hang Ada, 46 years old, from Nanjing, who made a living buying pig intestines. His wife, Tao, 34 years old, and the deceased child, their son Changsheng, were only five years old. Doctor Jia Shirong ordered the body of the deceased child to be taken back and placed in Yuqing Lane on Gonghe Road, pending a court inspection. The other four injured individuals include Gao Rixin, a boy, only three years old, from Funing, residing at No. 31 Haichang Branch Road; Gao Xu, 34 years old (Rixin is her son); Xu Baofu, 31 years old, from Jiangyin, residing at No. 78 Gonghe Road, the tenant of the Dasheng pork shop; and Xu's son, Maotou, five years old, who was also playing at the entrance and was injured. Except for Gao Xu, whose injuries were more serious and who is currently hospitalized, the others have been bandaged and discharged.</p>
<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>Wuzhou Gifts Last Day: The summer bargain gift event held by Wuzhou Drugstore this summer was very popular. Because the company's summer goods are complete, and the methods are very generous, such as a 20% discount on all products made by the company, plus gifts, it is really an innovation. This preferential treatment is scheduled to end on the 14th, and there are still those who request an extension, but because the company's gifts have exceeded the limit, it is really difficult to extend the period, so only today is the last chance.</p>
<p>Huasheng Electric Fans Sell Well: The Huasheng Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory in this city is the pioneer of electrical appliance manufacturing in our country. All kinds of electrical appliances produced are purely domestic goods. The most popular of its products are electric fans. The structure is ingenious, and the style is beautiful. This year the weather is hot early, and the daily sales volume of large and small electric fans from the factory is often around 2,000 units, which is enough to show that the Chinese people believe in domestic goods and recover their rights. It is said that the factory's inventory is about to run out, and it is now working overtime to rush production to meet market demand. Various electrical material stores in this city and other places are ordering fans from the factory, and there are so many orders that they are overwhelmed.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: My client, Li Shenfu, states that yesterday he read in your newspaper's June 25th edition a news item stating that I was recently sued in the District Court by Bao Bingkun. The matter is a civil dispute between shareholders of Tonghe Bank. Mr. Bao has raised a criminal lawsuit. The evidence is ironclad. Now, reading your newspaper, I am shocked to see the words "embezzlement" and that "Tonghe Bank has closed down, and Li is responsible for the liquidation, and has taken the opportunity to commit fraud, misappropriating the contract and excessive payments and rent, etc., of more than 6,000 yuan." After reading, I am deeply shocked. This case has no such title, nor am I responsible for the liquidation. After the bank closed, all accounts, etc., were taken away by Bao Bingkun for liquidation, so there is no possibility of embezzlement. I am commissioned to write this letter to you, requesting that you investigate and correct this matter. I assure you of my public spirit. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Kanghou, July 13.</p>
<p>Note of Thanks: Yesterday, my colleague Fu Yuantang sent me 50 packages of Tianzhong tea and 50 bottles each of Toad Su Pill and Wolong Pill. I will distribute them on their behalf. Thank you.</p>

<h3>My Country's Soccer Team's European Tour</h3>
<p>— Written and Sent by Captain Li Huitang</p>
<p>Rangoon, August 8 (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(June 24) At dawn, the sound of crows in front of the courtyard pierces the ears. Looking into the distance, the crows on the electric wires form a line, like a page of Western sheet music. At 8:00, I recorded old man Xie and Huang manager coming to the dock to pick up Yu Junzhuohua. First, whether the team was approved when passing through Singapore for the competition in Rangoon and India was not properly arranged, so I asked old horse Yu Jun, who knows the way, to go to the two places on behalf of our team to negotiate. The local community in Rangoon prepared the event very well and warmly welcomed us. It was all due to Yu Jun's prior publicity. This morning, Yu Jun returned from Calcutta, India. He said that the various matters there have been discussed and arranged, and they are waiting for us to arrive. At 3:00 p.m., the entire overseas Chinese community in Rangoon held a welcome meeting. The venue was decorated magnificently, and hundreds of people participated, making it an unprecedented event. During the meeting, Consul Cai and the leaders of the overseas Chinese community gave speeches one after another. Director Rong and the reporters stood up to thank them in Mandarin and English. There were also many British people present. Among them was Dr. Gray, who used to work at the Shanghai YMCA and had close ties with Chinese sports. When the 6th Far Eastern Games were held in Japan in the 12th year of the Republic of China, he also accompanied the team to the East as an advisor. Today, we met again in a foreign land, and we almost did not recognize each other. Fourteen years of vicissitudes and changes, we sighed facing each other. At 5:00, we were invited to watch this leisure A-level round-robin match. There is only one football team here, and all competitions are held here. The football field is wide and long, with a red wall thousands of feet around. There are two football fields inside, and the A and B level competitions are held at the same time. The stands are built majestically and have roofs to protect from the rain. The super-class seats are also equipped with fans, and flowers and trees are planted around them, matched with gardening. Its magnificence and spectacle are beyond compare, except for the three Far Eastern stadiums in China, Japan, and the Philippines, and the stadiums in one or two major cities in Australia. In the Far East and Southeast Asia, there is really no one better than it. The arrangement of the field is also very proper. The water drainage is rapid. Unless there is a heavy rain, you will not feel its muddy and obstructive. It is said that the level of football here is very high. There are thirty or forty teams competing in the A level. The Indian team that was selected a few years ago also returned with its feathers clipped, and has not dared to come again. Although what I saw today was not particularly good, their short passes were excellent, the ball control was proper, and the average was quite remarkable. Our team has successive injuries and illnesses, and the forwards feel that their strength is weak. In the upcoming competition, with strong enemies ahead, I am extremely worried. In addition, the overseas Chinese here have even higher expectations. Whether the future is good or bad, I really want to predict it as soon as possible, so as not to be worried and uneasy all day long.</p>
<p>(June 25) The rain master who must patronize once a day has never broken his promise in recent days, but we do not feel annoyed, but rather welcome him, because the weather is cool and the sleep at night is comfortable, so that we do not toss and turn. Today is our first battle. We also asked to postpone the welcome party to another day, so that the teammates could rest and sharpen themselves. At half past four, we changed clothes and went to the football field. The audience was full. It was said that it was already full at half past three and ticket sales were stopped. It is estimated that the total number of people was around 20,000. Our team's lineup that day was as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Li Guowei Liang Rongzhao Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang Tan Jiangbai Li Huitang Sun Jinshun Yang Yongyi</p>
<p>Today's opponent is the English Army Rifle Team, one of the strongest teams in the A level. After taking the stage, our team was unknown to the opponent's reality, and calmly dealt with it. Ten minutes later, Tan, the left forward, got a short pass from the reporter, and shot cleverly. Soon, the reporter also got the benefit of a cross from the right wing and made another contribution. After these two losses, their team launched a fierce counterattack, and their right forward returned a goal. Then Tan Jiangbai volleyed a shot, creating a 3-1 situation in the first half. In the second half, Jinshun went to the meeting alone and returned with success. Before long, the enemy's center forward retaliated with a close shot, making it 4-2. At this time, the ball came and went, and the battle situation was quite tense, but later our team's forwards became very active and broke through four barriers one after another by the reporter alone. The enemy's entire line collapsed. However, before the end of the game, our defense was lax, and the left wing shot another goal, so our team won with a score of 8-3. The overseas Chinese community was beaming and expressed satisfaction with our performance. Even the Western media believed that the art was outstanding and rare to see. Our team's formation on that day was not very neat, but everyone worked hard and worked together, so the kick came from the heart. Although the defense lost three goals, which was the highest record of goals lost in the Southern Tour, each person's performance was also full of their duties. Because of the lack of materials in the front, Jiangbai was forced to be transferred to the team. Jiangbai's heading skills are excellent, taking advantage of unlimited advantages, and good at stabbing, which is very helpful. The whole line's short passes are excellent, and the ball arrives when the person arrives, which is most appreciated by the audience. The reporter made five goals alone, winning the approval of Chinese and foreign people, which is really gratifying. In the evening, we were invited to watch a movie, and we returned together at midnight.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News from the 11th Olympic Games</h3>
<p>Ling Gymnastics</p>
<p>We have recently received news from Sweden that the country has decided to hold a "mass gymnastics" performance at the upcoming Olympic Games in Berlin, to promote Ling gymnastics (Lingache Gymnansik). This performance is scheduled to take place at 6:45 PM on August 8, after the track and field competition, inside the stadium. Six hundred Swedish athletes, male and female, will participate in the performance. This "mass gymnastics" performance will promote Ling gymnastics' method of educating the body, which is of great importance to the training of the whole body. In Sweden, this gymnastics has long become a mass movement.</p>
<p>Ling gymnastics has many advantages, the most notable of which is its "adaptability." Because of its adaptability, it can be practiced by people of all ages, genders, strengths, and weaknesses, unlike other sports that require various conditions that are not accessible to everyone. To ensure that sports figures from various countries participating in the Olympic Games gain a sufficient understanding of Ling gymnastics, the Swedish National Gymnastics Association has prepared several excellent performances to showcase during the Olympic Games. Sweden is currently preparing to hold six performances at the "International Sports School Association" as a rehearsal, and will also have a special performance by a team of boys and girls aged 11 to 15 and male and female adult teams. Each performance will involve 16 to 24 people. The expanded performance planned by Sweden is unprecedented at the International Sports School Federation, so its performance is sure to add unparalleled glory to the federation.</p>
<p>Olympic Basketball Court</p>
<p>At its recent regular meeting, the International Basketball Association decided to use the basketball court designated by the Olympic Committee for this year's Olympic basketball competition. In addition, another basketball court will be built next to the tennis court next to the stadium, specifically for the finals. After detailed inspection, the court, hoops, etc., were deemed to be quite qualified. The preliminaries and semi-finals will be held on the basketball court set up next to the tennis court. All basketball competitions will be held at 5 or 6 PM, so the location of the court must be chosen to be shielded from the sun. The surface of the court will be constructed with special soil so that it can be played even after rain. The International Basketball Association has decided that all basketball competitions will be held outdoors and is making every effort to ensure that the competition is no less than it would be in a gymnasium.</p>
<p>"Honor Book" of This Year's Olympic Games</p>
<p>The Olympic Organizing Committee will produce an honor book to pass on the names of those who sponsored this year's Olympic Games to posterity. The book will begin with the signature of the German leader Hitler, followed by the signatures of various dignitaries and the names of the first, second, and third place winners in each event. The content of the book will be particularly rich, and the binding will be beautiful, making it a highly valuable souvenir of this year's Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Oak Tree for Olympic Winners</p>
<p>The Olympic Committee for this year's Olympic Games accepted the suggestion of artist Ruth to present each winning country with a small oak tree that can be taken back to their home country for cultivation as a permanent memorial. The tree has been cultivated for more than a year and is very lush, with heights ranging from 70 to 100 centimeters. It is planted in a specially made pot with the Olympic bell and the following slogan burned into it:</p>
<p>Increase the glory of victory, promote deep and light industry</p>
<p>The small oak tree is packed in a suitable carrying case for easy transport and comes with a cultivation guide for future care. During the voyage, the ship's owner is responsible for cultivation. According to past experience, this tree can live and grow in any soil and climate. In this way, this tree can serve as a centennial memorial of the Berlin Olympics.</p>
<p>Bicycle Competition Venue</p>
<p>The original plan to build a permanent bicycle track for the Olympic bicycle competition could not be realized due to unforeseen circumstances. The Olympic Organizing Committee therefore decided to build a temporary track. The track will be open from July 1 to August 9 and is located next to the German Hall on the sports field of the Berlin Sports Association, making transportation very convenient. The track is currently being built by the famous German architect Xu Man, an expert in building this type of track, who has built bicycle tracks in Rome, Berlin, and other major cities. The track is 400 meters long and 6.5 meters wide, with a 3-meter high bank in the curves and a 1.6-meter high edge. The total area is 2,980 square meters. The grandstand next to the track can accommodate 1,500 people, with changing rooms for athletes underneath. The perimeter of the track can accommodate 12,000 people. Construction of the track began on June 15, and public practice on the track can begin on July 1. The Olympic bicycle competition will take place on August 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation Requests Investigation of Education Fund Case: Municipal Government Approves Investigation of Progress - More Than 170,000 Yuan in Unified Public Bonds Have Been Redeemed - Current Storage at the United University Closure is Not a Fact</h3>
<p>(From the Dagong Society) The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday approved a document from the First Special District Citizens' Federation regarding the request to investigate the case of the 100,000 yuan previously allocated for the Labor Education Fund and properly deposited in the National Bank. According to the submission, the Municipal Labor Education Finance Committee has been instructed to investigate and report. The reply stated that the 100,000 yuan for the Labor Education Fund had been properly deposited in the National Bank. The association stated that the initial allocation from the Municipal Executive Committee was 116,000 yuan in face value of 25 Treasury Bonds, with a current amount of 44,741 yuan. According to a resolution of the Municipal Labor Education Committee, only interest was allowed to be used, not the principal. Therefore, the society deposited the current amount with the United Bank Company, holding a fixed deposit certificate. After it expired on June 1 of last year, it was renewed for two years and has not yet expired. According to commercial practice, it would be difficult to withdraw it rashly. The original submission stating that the company had long been closed is not true. The principal of the 25 Treasury Bonds was gradually collected and used to purchase various public bonds. After the Ministry of Finance issued the unified public bonds, it was legally exchanged, resulting in 178,170 yuan in face value of unified public bonds. These public bonds were all deposited with the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, holding the bank's No. 34 custody certificate. The accounts of previous sessions of the association have been reported to the Ministry and the Municipal Executive Committee for review and approval. Now, the Municipal Federation's proposal to properly deposit the fund in the National Bank will be submitted to the Ministry and the Municipal Executive Committee for review and implementation after the fixed deposit expires. According to the order, the facts have been stated in detail, and it is hoped that they will be reviewed and approved. The Mayor of the Republic of China, Wu, on July 13, 25th year.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Bans Xingguang Elementary School: Corrupt Content Leads to Order to Shut Down</h3>
<p>Wang Shijie rented a bungalow at No. 4 Tonglefang, Intersection of Puen Ji Shi Road and Mayer Xi Ai Road, French Concession, and opened Xingguang Elementary School. The school building was narrow and dirty, and the content was particularly corrupt. The Municipal Education Bureau found out about this and ordered the school to be shut down because it was opened without approval and the content was extremely corrupt. It also sent a letter to the French Concession Board of Directors to assist in the ban. (According to the French Concession Board of Directors, it often fails to fully assist the Education Bureau in banning schools, resulting in a few schools taking shelter in the Concession and continuing to be corrupted. For the sake of the future of education and the interests of the residents of the Concession, it is hoped that the French Concession Board of Directors will not take it lightly.)</p>

Although Chinese merchants slightly stuffed shillings, banks still had appetite, resulting in a lack of change. In the afternoon session, Sassoon Bank was conducting interbank trading of shillings, and the opening was peaceful with not much trading.

<h3>Securities: Half-Day Trading of Government Bonds; Small Decline in Results</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only conducted half-day trading. The market initially strengthened and then weakened as long positions gradually emerged. The market price was too high and easily swayed. It is heard that the financial sector has a large amount of collateralized cash reserves to pay off principal and interest, but in this case, the old inventory will inevitably be squeezed out, and the market price will change very easily. The process yesterday was as follows: In the two morning sessions, retail investors' confidence was very strong, and Nos. 5 and 11 were sold off bravely. Series E was not seen in small quantities. When auctioning Series D forward contracts, San Erqi sold off a large amount, and the market price changed. After that, there was a consistent decline of 0.2 to 0.3 to 0.7. In the second session, market sentiment was still weak and unable to recover. Most of them fell by small amounts of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The market was originally at its peak, and a slight reversal was expected, but the trend has weakened and it is not easy to return to high levels for the time being. The market price ultimately fell across the board by 0.1 to 0.8 yuan. The total number of transactions was 64.9 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left, with the unit being yuan and the transaction unit being 100 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Buying Turns Strong in the Afternoon; Initial Decline in US Cotton No. 3 Causes Market Price to Fall; Later, Rumors of Market Recovery Lead to Sudden Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with the situation still chaotic. Long positions at Run Kang and Feng Tai were continuously increasing their positions. However, overseas yarn and cotton had been rising sharply for several days, and yesterday the upward trend slightly subsided, so some of it was sold off. In the afternoon, rumors of currency inflation resurfaced, boosting confidence and causing the market price to turn from decline to firmness.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Near-Term Up, Distant-Term Down</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened before noon with near-month contracts still firm, rising by 0.5 to 0.6 jiao. Bidding for distant-term contracts, considering that No. 3 yarn and US cotton had both fallen back, confidence suddenly loosened, and the market situation changed abruptly. In addition, after the increased special certificate, scattered accounts greatly decreased. Each month fell by more than one yuan, and the second and third sessions were flat. By the close, there was a slight rebound. The result was that near-month contracts fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and distant-term contracts fell by 1.3 to 1.4 yuan. The afternoon session opened with the market stable, falling by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. November and December reversed and rose by 0.5 yuan. During the second session, each month jumped wildly again by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan. This was because long positions continued to absorb and increase their positions in the morning, and the market again heard rumors of currency inflation, so buying strength increased. By the close, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were not smooth, slightly declining by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The result was that each month rose by an average of 1.3 to 1.8 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and distant-term contracts rose by 1.1 yuan. It was found that Shenji sold 2,250 bales, Renfeng 1,150 bales, Xiecheng 1,450 bales, Dachang 4,300 bales, Shengyuan 1,850 bales, Xinhua 1,050 bales, Yuda 3,450 bales, Taichang 1,450 bales, Changfeng 2,000 bales, Tonghe 1,200 bales, Tongji 950 bales.

<h3>Rumors of Squeezing Short Positions in Old Cotton - New Cotton Returns Slightly by 0.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>The rising trend of old cotton in the cotton market is becoming more intense. It is rumored that a certain party will sell 70,000 dan of linters to a certain gentleman, which has already been transferred to the warehouse. Therefore, the rumor of squeezing short positions is very intense. The August contract broke through the 50 yuan mark, but gave up on the new cotton, so the distance between near-term and distant-term contracts is getting farther and farther. As for the needs of the current cotton mill, it is exceptionally quiet.</p>
<p>Old Cotton's Rising Trend Intensifies</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened before noon with US cotton, which had been rising for many days, falling back by 6 to 10 pound notes, Indian cotton rising by 1 to 3 rupees, and Osaka No. 3 cotton falling by 0.6 to 0.7 jiao. Market sentiment was mediocre, and each month opened at a low price. The downward trend of new cotton was particularly strong. After the second session, old cotton gradually rebounded, with many saying that long positions intended to squeeze the shorts, but distant-month contracts fell downwards. As a result, near-month contracts rose by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan, and distant-term contracts fell back by 0.5 to 0.55 yuan. The afternoon session opened with a large trader limiting the purchase of 10,000 dan of old cotton at 49.5 yuan, causing the market to tighten and rise. The new cotton was affected and rose. After the second session, the momentum of the July and August contracts became stronger and stronger. In the third session, the August contract jumped out of the 50 yuan mark. At this time, Changfeng sold 8,000 dan in one go, but the October new cotton contract fell back. At the close, the old cotton was flat, and the August contract fell back into the 50 yuan mark. As a result, the old cotton rose by 0.45 yuan compared to the closing price of the morning session, and the new cotton rose by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. It was found that Dafeng sold 5,500 dan, Yuda 10,500 dan, Dafu 7,500 dan, Shenchang 4,300 dan, Changyu 3,200 dan, Shenji 9,800 dan, Changfeng 15,300 dan, Dachang 10,500 dan, Tonghe 4,000 dan, Changhe 2,800 dan, Yuan Yi 5,000 dan, Yicheng 2,000 dan, Taichang 2,000 dan, Yongchang 2,500 dan. Shengyuan bought 4,500 dan, Gengfeng 8,500 dan, Meiji 4,300 dan, Zhenda 3,200 dan, Run Kang 8,600 dan, Yongda 4,600 dan, Xincheng 8,800 dan, Juxing 3,500 dan, Mingde 7,000 dan, Hexing 12,000 dan, Duanda 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left:</p>

<p>Total 1,527,700</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Disappear</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton has disappeared. The factories, in view of the wild rise and fall of spot cotton, are all taking a wait-and-see attitude, so there are no transactions of spot cotton.</p>

<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Saw Sharp Rise Last Week</h3>
<p>Since the US Cotton Government report was released, Bombay's cotton industry has seen speculators and short positions actively buying due to the benefit to buyers, causing market prices to rise sharply. Overseas inquiries were limited, and exports were average. The spot market was quite active due to buying to cover short positions. Indian yarn mills bought a lot, but the market price of textiles failed to keep up with the rise in the market price of raw cotton. Rainfall was not heavy, and it would be more beneficial if it was sunny and rainy at times. Generally speaking, the condition of new cotton can be described as satisfactory. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<h3>Food: Wheat Prices Gradually Approaching Foreign Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was flat and soft in the morning session, but the decline was still small. In the afternoon session, near-term and distant-term contracts plummeted at the same time. The quoted prices of foreign wheat: Chicago fell sharply by 1.65 yuan to 1.78 yuan, and Canada fell by 1.34 yuan. When the opening price was announced, the supply of current wheat was strong, and the factories were unwilling to open for purchase, so confidence naturally weakened. Therefore, July, August, and September fell by 0.6 to 0.8 yuan. The November and December contracts were still stable, falling slightly by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. When the afternoon session opened, the current environment was inevitably not good, and the non-industry long positions were dwarfed by the actual selling of the code, so each month fell sharply step by step. In terms of the most distant-term contracts at present, it seems that the price has approached the price of foreign wheat. If the government cares about people's food, it can freely order wheat according to past practice, then speculators will find it difficult to persist. Moreover, this phenomenon is not reasonable soon after the new wheat is released. I wonder if the authorities are paying attention to this. In the current wheat market, the factory appetite is still good, and customers are selling back. The price of Zhongguan goods has increased by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the price of high-quality goods is only 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The prices are: Nanjing wheat 4.3 yuan, next grade 4.37 yuan, Pukou wheat 4.42 yuan, Huaian wheat 4.49 yuan, Luhe wheat 4.46 yuan, next grade 4.33 yuan, Zhuzhen wheat 4.489 yuan, Hushu wheat 4.44 yuan, Gaoyou wheat 4.48 yuan, Yangzhou wheat 4.367 yuan, Hankou wheat 4.323 yuan, Yanghe wheat 4.5, ship wheat 4.04 yuan, as high as 4.2 yuan. Shan Shen, Da Fu, and Feng each went to 3,000 bales, and Fuxin went to 12,000 bales.</p>

<h3>Flour Transactions Virtually Halted</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was still calm in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Since it is rumored that the price limit cannot be lifted for a while, transactions between the two sides have mostly halted. Under this situation, long positions will inevitably hoard and refuse to resell at the limit price. Therefore, short positions who urgently need to close are rumored to secretly offer discounts to solve the problem. The prices rumored are different, ranging from 0.5 yuan to 1.5 yuan, but it soon fell to 0.8 yuan to 0.9 yuan, and there was still a lack of acceptance. This situation has no basis and can only be tentatively spoken of and tentatively listened to.</p>
<p>In addition, the current price of each factory is still at 1.5 jiao. In recent days, customers from all over the country have been reduced and are not as urgent as before. Therefore, if we consider the facts, there should be no disputes between the two sides.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another 135 bales of June white soybeans from Hankou and 73 bales of Chengmen soybeans from Jiujiang arrived in Shanghai. The harvest in various places this year is still abundant, and the products are of good color. The market price is also higher than in previous years. The price of Jiujiang Chengmen soybeans is 6 yuan, and the price of Hankou Shan Yuebai is 6.27 yuan, distributed by the Fuzhou gang on this street. There are also new Wenzhou soybeans that arrived on Saturday, but because they arrived late, they did not enter the warehouse, which caused a delay of two days. The soybean products were found to have mold due to the new goods, so the goods were sold off at a reduced price, and they were handled by the Ningbo gang at a price of 5.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Twenty Tons of Pure Antimony Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain foreign firm sold twenty tons of pure antimony at a price of six hundred and sixty yuan per ton, an increase of about ten yuan from before. It is noted that recently, Changsha antimony merchants have become more bullish due to the changing situation, so they are keen to see a continued improvement in the price of pure antimony.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Speculative Rice Worries about Steaming Damage Leading to Price Cuts and Sales</h3>
<p>The market conditions for speculative rice have been declining continuously in recent days, seemingly without end. Yesterday, speculative dealers remained inactive, while local merchants showed no interest. Fearing spoilage from heat and losses in weight due to pests, owners and merchants reduced prices again to expedite sales. As a result, prices decreased slightly by ten to fifteen cents, leading to a slight improvement in trading activity. 4,000 bags of late-harvest Jiangxi machine-milled rice, 1,500 bags of early-harvest rice, and 837 bags of other rice, broken rice, and brown rice, along with 584 bags of Hunan rice and 100 bags of Jiangbei brown rice, were sold off entirely by local merchants. However, the market's overall trend remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>River Rice Market Shows Slight Improvement Due to Cooler Weather, Less Spoilage; Shops Increase Purchases at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over ten dealers from the central regions (South Shanghai) arrived with a total of more than 3,000 piculs of goods. Due to overcast weather, market sentiment stabilized slightly, and local sales saw a slight improvement, tightening market conditions. Prices for thick-grained early rice rose slightly, with Southern merchants purchasing over 300 bags of thin-husked rice, stabilizing market trends. Northern merchants also purchased over 600 bags, with prices yet to be announced. Fine-grained rice from Duyang followed suit with a slight increase, showing no significant gains or losses aside from spoilage.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Recent hot weather has made river rice prone to discoloration, causing prices to fall daily. Yesterday, arrivals from various river-based dealers were slightly higher, numbering about 34 or 35. As the weather turned cooler, the arrived river goods could be stored for a few days. Shops also slightly increased purchases during this period of low prices. As a result, sales of early-morning white rice showed slight activity, with fresh local white rice prices rising nearly ten cents. Prices for older, less fresh rice remained stable. Arrivals of thin-husked rice were limited, with active sales and firm prices. Arrivals of fine-grained rice were slightly higher, with average sales and firm prices at higher levels. Speculative fine-grained rice remained weak.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Local Mills' Fine Drills in Short Supply, Prices Rise; Dealers' Purchases Remain Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although cotton yarn prices showed a slight recovery, they remained very firm. After sharp increases last week, there was no firm market base until yesterday when prices were set. Dealers purchased actively based on market prices. Local mills experienced significant shortages of stock. Fine drills from local mills saw the largest price increases, rising by 20 cents per piece compared to last week. Fine cloth, market cloth, and 84 cloth also rose by 15 cents per piece. Light-weight coarse cloth and coarse drills rose by 10 cents, while heavy-weight coarse cloth and coarse drills rose by 10 to 15 cents per piece. Lower-grade bleached cloth and Ewo Factory's Golden Pagoda brand had no market activity. Miscellaneous brands rose in price by 20 to 30 cents per piece. Dyed cloth, Shelin cloth, and blue cloth rose by 20 to 30 cents per piece. Serge, broadcloth, woolen cloth, and printed piece goods rose by about 30 cents per piece. Merchants and factories maintained firm positions, with market prices remaining 10 to 20 cents above prevailing levels. Dealers' purchases were brisk. Ningbo-Shaoxing dealers purchased over 100 pieces of heavy-weight coarse cloth and over 200 pieces of light-weight coarse cloth, along with dozens of cases of serge and broadcloth. Henan and Shanxi dealers purchased over 100 pieces of printed broadcloth, serge, plain serge from local mills, white goods, fine cloth from various factories, and fine drills. Demand was also good in Changsha, Hankou, Nanchang, Luzhou, Wuhu, and along the Yangtze River, with fine cloth and fine drills from local mills being the most popular. Sales in Yantai on the northern route and the two Guangdong provinces on the southern route remained sluggish. Yesterday, over 100 pieces of fine cloth and over 200 pieces of fine drills were traded.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Camel Wool Continues to Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Domestically produced wide and narrow striped plain camel wool has gradually entered the market. Local merchants, such as Baodaxiang and Xiedaxiang in the southern city and Chunheyonghua and Xinyonghua in the northern city, have significant orders and transactions. Shanghai offices representing Chengdu, Yunnan, and Guiyang have also negotiated and completed deals. Existing stock from Wei Yi, Da Dong, Wei Lun, Shen Chang, and Tian Xiang factories continues to be shipped out. Neither buyers nor sellers have made any announcements.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Hits New High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York market was closed. The Yokohama silk market was firm, exceeding previous levels. Spot prices opened at 750 yuan, and futures opened at 740 yuan, up 7 to 13 yuan from last week, marking a new high price since the arrival of new silk. In Europe, the silk market remained unchanged. Shanghai yarn prices remained firm, difficult to reconcile with overseas markets. Yesterday, yarn merchants purchased fifteen bales of Zebra and other brands at very firm prices. Foreign firms saw limited transactions in grey silk and Wan Shou silk, with prices also rising accordingly.</p>
<h3>Sun Beauty Rayon Sales Especially Strong</h3>
<p>120-count Sun Beauty brand rayon is selling exceptionally well. Hangzhou dealers made special trips to purchase a total of over 50 cases, and local Shanghai silk factories purchased over 20 cases, all at a price of 395 yuan. Tian Qiao brand was priced at 404-405 yuan, with several cases sold. Stocks of Tian Tan brand were already sold out, but demand remained strong. Clients from Hangzhou and Shengze are currently gathered in Shanghai, awaiting news of tomorrow's customs auction at the Shanghai Jianghai Customs. Shipments are unable to be made today because under the new customs regulations, goods cannot be transported without a tax-paid sales permit. From today onwards, local firms are unable to obtain tax-paid sales permits due to unclear procedures.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui Tea for American Sales Also Active</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's Ping Shui green tea has traditionally sold well in the United States. In recent years, due to competition from Japanese tea, its market share has declined. This year, Hua Tea's trade with the United States has shown slight activity due to stable exchange rates. Yesterday, Huzhou Gao Zhuang Da Bang and Jinlong Hua Tea firms have already opened for business, with over 1,600 cases traded at prices ranging from 39 yuan to 44.50 yuan. High-quality Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang Zhen Mei tea sales are exceptionally strong, while lower-grade teas have been sluggish. In the black tea market, there has been no major progress. Fragrant teas continue to sell well to Russian merchants, but due to abundant arrivals, market prices have fallen by 3-4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Price Rises by 20 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable and positive. The association's set prices were 22.10 yuan for current goods of 24 coarse white sugar, and 6.90 yuan for re-export goods. Transactions were made. Dongbai sugar was still being processed, with current goods priced at 22 yuan for #4, 21.40 yuan for #8, and 21.15 yuan for #9. Re-export goods were priced at 6.90 yuan for #4, a slight decrease; 6.80 yuan for #8; and 6.20 yuan for #9, a slight decrease. Prices for local mill's refined white sugar brands, such as Ji Dahua Jin Xin, remained unchanged. Chaozhou dealers offered excellent Zhiyang white sugar at 14.70 yuan, with over 100 bags traded. Refined red sugar was priced at 14.30 yuan to 14.10 yuan, and also at 13.40 yuan to 13.20 yuan, with over one hundred bags traded. Ordinary Huanggang Qing sold 200 bags at 10 yuan, up 10 cents. Xinghua dealers offered over 100 bags of standard Mingjing red sugar at 12.90 yuan to 12.80 yuan, up 30-40 cents.</p>
<p>A joint company held its first weekly exchange of Guangdong sugar yesterday. The total fixed quota was 7,637 bags. The quoted price for Guangdong's Wuyang coarse white and refined white sugar each increased by 20 cents. The sale of 250 bags of Qu Xi Factory's Wuyang coarse white sugar was priced at 21.30 yuan, and the Shunde Factory sugar was priced at 21.80 yuan. The Dongguan Factory sugar was priced at 21.70 yuan, none of which were sold. #4 refined white was priced at 20.60 yuan for 20 bags, but there was no #2 refined white sugar available.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Zhong Xing Vegetables Arrive Today</h3>
<p>According to a long-distance telephone message from Zhenjiang yesterday, the first batch of Zhong Xing vegetables, totaling over 100 packages, was loaded onto vehicles yesterday and should arrive today. New vegetables from Xuzhou have been arriving continuously at a firm price of 20 yuan. It is said that at the beginning of the new vegetable season, price fluctuations are relatively large, and the industry will follow past practices and coordinate with each other to avoid losses from competition.</p>
<p>According to a telegraph message from Hankou yesterday, wood ear fungus prices rose again to 93 yuan and are expected to reach 99 yuan. The Shanghai market is expected to follow this trend.</p>
<h3>Metals: Sales of Large White Lead Become Sluggish</h3>
<p>Large white lead is a frequently sold product to military factories, copper coin bureaus, and machine factories. Since the production of domestically produced white lead, imports have gradually decreased. Currently, imported products are quoted at 21 yuan, while domestic products are quoted at 19.50 yuan. Yesterday's market transactions were only 40-50 dan.</p>
<h3>Food for Thought</h3>
<p>You must first give others some benefit and joy, and then you will have benefit and joy yourself; respect the happiness of others, and then you will have your own happiness. (Tolstoy)</p>
<p>The joy of life is in the fierce battles of life. (Strindberg)</p>
<p>A man who stakes his whole life on the love of a woman, and then gets angry and loses control when he loses, and is unable to do anything, cannot be considered a real man. (Turgenev)</p>

<p>It is the power of words, not the sword, that enables mankind to conquer hypocrisy and injustice, and to achieve mutual love and lasting peace. (Zola) (Han Mei)</p>
<h3>Summer Day at Gaoqiao: A Small Record of Seaside Swimming</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Shanghai is neither hell nor heaven. During the hottest days of summer, the scorching sun steams everyone, causing them to complain endlessly, like ants in a frying pan. Those who are accustomed to living in cramped quarters need not be told, but even the pleasure-seeking class in high-rise buildings are unable to move; at this time, everyone racks their brains to find places to escape the summer heat. The most miserable are the middle class who are neither rich nor poor. Hey! Should the middle class always suffer? No! No! We must find a way to break the myth of fate.</p>
<p>Some people say that although Shanghai is not as good as Qingdao, Dalian, Guling, or Putuo, fortunately Gaoqiao also has a natural seaside swimming area, where all the facilities are enough for you to enjoy yourself to the fullest. The day before yesterday, I gathered more than a dozen good male and female companions to take the city ferry from the Bund directly to Gaoqiao. Although the sun was blazing, the cool breeze from the ocean swept away all the summer heat. During this one-hour water journey, you can see the scenery on both sides of the river, the docks and warehouses of various countries, the power plant that ranks third in the world, foreign textile factories, and oil tanks such as Mobil, Asia, and Texaco. So many large economic enterprises have given us a huge shock! Fortunately, we also have the newly built fishing market and the Qiu Jiang pier, which boosted our spirits. After arriving at the Gaoqiao pier, we transferred to a "bus" and passed through winding, flat roads, reaching a beautiful village. Coming from the smoky city to the green fields, it made you feel refreshed and exhilarated, shouting praises endlessly!</p>
<p>Gaoqiao seaside has a vast beach, elegant grass huts, and Mongolian-style tents. Standing far away, you can see islands scattered, and sails dotting the sea, as if you are in a painting. Such beautiful scenery makes you want to linger and forget to return. The red and green-clad bathers, regardless of East or West, male or female, young or old, are all sorts. It seems that foreigners are more enthusiastic than Chinese people. What is most noticeable is several old foreigners, sitting on the beach, holding their foot-long white beards with both hands, as if they were tired from swimming. There are also foreign old ladies, swimming with their chests out and buttocks protruding, and even five or six-year-old boys can swim the breaststroke. Our team also bravely went into the sea to swim until sunset before returning with satisfaction. A certain lady said: "Seawater bathing is really indescribably pleasant, after all, it is more comfortable than drinking ice in an air-conditioned room." Perhaps this is her insightful remark.</p>

<h3>It's Also Speculation</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>He studied a certain foreign language thirty years ago. At that time, he was a young man with great ambitions. He was indignant about the deterioration of national affairs and thought of learning a certain foreign language; his motivation was to go abroad to study and then return to the country after completing his studies, so that he could fulfill his grand ambition of saving the country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. The pressure of life relentlessly drove and beat him, forcing him to abandon his grand ambition of saving the country; therefore, he was too lazy to learn a certain foreign language, and he had no time to learn it. For the sake of food and clothing, he ran around, accumulating every penny, until today he has become a wealthy man. Naturally, he no longer mentions saving the country, but now he wants to learn a certain foreign language again.</p>
<p>He has wanted to learn a certain foreign language again for the past five years. However, his mind is constantly shifting with the news in the newspapers. When the news is tense, his heart pounds; when it is relaxed, his desire to learn a certain foreign language fades slightly. He often thinks: So-and-so has become a "expert" in something, and So-and-so has been appointed as a comprador in a certain company. These young classmates live in foreign houses, drive cars, and have foreign wives who are good at being gentle and considerate. It's really too comfortable. Isn't this due to their knowledge of a certain foreign language? Who am I, how can I fall behind?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, his heart rises and falls like the tide, unable to control himself. At first, he thought that a sixty-year-old man learning boxing would be laughed at by others, let alone learning a certain foreign language, so he couldn't help but feel disappointed. But then he thought, if I don't learn now, when will I learn? Then he felt a hundred times more courageous. However, he has abandoned a certain foreign language for a long time, and he doesn't even recognize the letters anymore. What can he do? It's okay, there are many books like "100-Day Fluency" and "Introduction" now. Buying them and looking at them will always be helpful. If someone asks him what he is doing reading these books, he always replies lightly: "I'll need it in the future!"</p>
<h3>Mourners Greatly Pleased</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Because of the crowded population in Shanghai, the residences are pitifully narrow—of course, self-built Western-style houses are an exception. Once there is a wedding, funeral, or celebration, with guests arriving in droves, how can a ceremony be held in a snail shell? One has to borrow the auditorium of a restaurant or public hall. As for the place to hold a funeral, most of them are in temples, because temples have spacious grounds, and most of them have kitchens, preparing dozens of tables of vegetarian banquets is not a big deal. The arrangement of the mourning hall is also magnificent, and the monks chanting sutras are also comfortable and convenient. Therefore, people are willing to spend more money.</p>
<p>Funerals are different from celebrations. Relatives and friends arrive in the morning. There is no business for military bands here, only a group of small horns, sitting at the entrance, and as soon as a guest arrives, they start blowing mournfully. A servant dressed in plain clothes, holding up an invitation, leads you to the mourning hall. The drum beats several times. You can kneel and bow, or bow. The filial sons and grandsons also prostrate themselves and return the bow as a courtesy. Then you sit in the living room, drink tea, smoke cigarettes, and wait for a sumptuous vegetarian meal.</p>
<p>During lunch, the wine is poured cup by cup, and the dishes are served one after another. The guests cheer and laugh, just like at a wedding, except there is no finger-guessing game. The filial sons, grandsons, daughters, and daughters-in-law also drink heartily at this time, and have fun with their relatives and friends.</p>
<p>After lunch, several happy relatives and friends even pull out a table to play eight rounds of mahjong. In this way, the atmosphere of sadness in the mourning hall is completely eliminated. The sound of mahjong tiles clattering, the noise of people talking, and the chanting of Buddhist scriptures truly create a situation where "the dead rest in peace" and "the mourners are greatly pleased."</p>
<p>However, when I open the obituary, the filial sons always say "unconscious with grief" and "weeping blood," so we should be thinking of consolation. How can we bear to have fun? But if there is really a hall full of sorrow and desolation, I think relatives and friends would not want to come to accompany the tears!</p>
<h3>A Phoenix Replaces the Oriole</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Seeing and Hearing Are Uncertain, Sinking and Floating Doubts Reappear; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted, Giving Heartfelt Grieving Poems</p>
<p>He just circled and looked, looked and circled, almost obliterating a large portion of the several sheets of paper. The words crossed out on the letter were of course incoherent, so if he wanted to send a letter to Guoqi, he would have to throw this letter away and rewrite it. Did he have this intention? He crumpled the scribbled letter into a ball of paper and began to grind ink and spread out another sheet. But just as he lifted his pen, a rooster crowed in the distant, cold sky. Looking again out the glass window, the edge of the sky in the southeast seemed to have a bit of fish-belly color. He had only focused on writing the letter and hadn't realized it was so late. At the same time, he noticed a chill on his feet, creeping upwards. He put down the pen and yawned twice in a row. His eyelids felt unusually dry and he couldn't help but sleep. So he threw what he had written in the corner of the table. Then he held the lamp and shone it in the corner of the table, found the paper ball, tore it to shreds as well, and then threw it into the spittoon. Still not reassured, he looked around again, making sure there was nothing written anywhere, before going to bed to sleep. This night's hard work was no less exhausting than having a minor illness, so he lay in bed without even turning over, and slept for eight or nine hours. The family had called him two or three times in the morning. In a daze, he mumbled that he was sick and went back to sleep. It wasn't until lunchtime that Madam Jiang went upstairs to check on him, and he finally got up. Thinking about what had happened last night, he felt very troubled and couldn't really eat anything at mealtime. After eating, he simply didn't go to school. His family thought he was feeling unwell, so of course, they didn't urge him. But there was someone outside who hoped he would go to school today, even more intensely than on ordinary days. Who was this? It was Zhang Guoqi, who had written the letter to test him. After sending the letter, the longer the time passed, the more anxious he became. He kept thinking to himself, if he was angry, he would definitely write back a few sentences. Judging by the time, the letter had already been written and should be in the post office. If he thought the letter was acceptable, then there would also be a reply. The letter was definitely on the way. Whether it was good or bad, it would surely be revealed in a few hours. Guoqi first thought this at home, but when he went out the door to go to school, he walked along the road looking like he had solved a difficult math problem, his face full of smiles, nodding his head several times. Thinking, why wait for his reply? He could meet him on the road and see him clearly. If he was happy, his face would definitely be smiling. If he was unhappy, he would definitely have a stern face, and might even curse. No, no, he wasn't that kind of person. Thinking of this, he shook his head a couple of times to show that he didn't mean that. (47)</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Air Raid and Poison Gas Defense Knowledge Exhibition (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>In addition, there was also an exhibition on battlefield first aid, including three parts:   how to search for wounded soldiers,   how to transport wounded soldiers,   how to treat wounded soldiers. The content was very rich, especially the part on transporting wounded soldiers, which had many photos taken, most of them taken inside Wusong China Public School, which was destroyed by enemy fire. It is said that there was a reason why they took photos there, which was to make the public recall the pain of the past. The first aid supplies that first aid workers and the public must carry during evacuation were also displayed. Under the first aid charts were eye-catching slogans: "We need first aid workers as much as we need soldiers," "First aid workers are the loving mothers of soldiers," "Perfect first aid equipment can increase the courage of the army," "We will not let loyal and brave soldiers die in vain," "Saving one more wounded soldier preserves one more strength," "Careful battlefield first aid saves effort in rear treatment," "Many wounded soldiers cannot bear the pain and smash their heads," etc. The public's poison gas defense and first aid exhibition was organized by the Military First Aid Team of Tongji University. Their intention was to arouse the deep attention of the public and Chinese university students to battlefield first aid because the existing first aid personnel were far from meeting the actual needs.</p>
<p>The association also set aside a corner to display books on public air defense, poison gas defense, and other topics.</p>
<p>There were several small booklets on air raid and poison gas defense and first aid knowledge for sale at the venue. It is said that the association strived to keep the price of these books low, and one could buy one for just a few copper coins.</p>
<p>The exhibition period of the association is tentatively set for three weeks. After the closing ceremony, it will be exhibited in rotation at various youth associations.</p>
<p>Although the scale of this exhibition is not large, its effect on arousing public attention to air defense, poison gas defense, and first aid is not small. One more thing worth mentioning: it was heard that some of the charts displayed by the association were deemed to be of an aggressive nature by a certain official and were interfered with. After repeated explanations by a foreign affairs officer of the Youth Association, they were allowed to be displayed. In this environment, what kind of feeling do you have when you see such an exhibition? I'm sure those of you who plan to visit will be able to appreciate it!</p>
<p>Prepare! Prepare! This is the public's preparation!</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Occasional Writings on the Lake (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Sent by Tianxu Wosheng from West Lake</p>
<p>From afar, I pity the young traveler stranded in a foreign land,</p>
<p>How could he easily forget the kindness and hatred of his homeland?</p>
<p>In my dreams, I see my kind parents with hair like snow,</p>
<p>Silently facing each other, talking about family matters.</p>
<p>Ten thousand calamus and mugwort sway by the Jian Pavilion gate,</p>
<p>Vivid tiger heads quiver, tender and yellow.</p>
<p>Slanting mist and swirling smoke fly without end,</p>
<p>My old garden is once again in a state of apprehension today.</p>
<p>No scheme can relieve the sorrow of separation,</p>
<p>For twenty years, my heart has been filled with the thought of repaying my parent's kindness.</p>
<p>I sent a painted silk fan, but it has been delayed,</p>
<p>By the time it arrives, I expect the weather will be deep autumn.</p>
<p>This is a poem written ten years ago by Cui'er to Shi'er. At that time, Shi'er was in Japan, and I was in Hangzhou celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival. I also wrote a poem, which is slightly similar to Cui'er's second poem, also about seasonal objects. In the old customs of our Hangzhou, every festival must have a traditional seasonal item passed down through generations. Most of these have a scientific function, regardless of the widespread sanitary and cleaning movements. For example, sweeping the house before and after the winter solstice, and sweeping the tombs before and after the Qingming Festival, are both examples of cleanliness starting from one's own home and extending to the remote and uninhabited areas of the countryside. The word "Duanyang" uses "Duan" to mean "correct." The sun travels along the central path, upright and without deviation. The time of the upright noon is called the Tianzhong Festival. This is the only day and time of the year that is aligned with the Zi hour of the fifteenth night of the eleventh month, when the moon travels in the middle of the sky, following the same path. The poem by ancient people, "How many times in life do you see the moon overhead," refers to this night, not the Mid-Autumn Festival. The burrows of naked insects are usually in warm, deep places. Even when the thunder of the Awakening of Insects season rumbles, they remain dormant and do not come out, because they fear the cold. Only in the Wu month, Wu day, and Wu hour, does the sunlight directly shine underground, penetrating every pore. This is similar to the mirage seen in the dark room, through the cracks in doors and windows, where the slanting sunlight shines in. When there is water in the ground, steam is generated. Naked insects have no armor, so they cannot bear it. Therefore, they urgently seek to move. Snakes, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, and shrimp, all five poisonous insects, appear on the ground. Once out of the ground, the sun scorches them even more intensely. So they hide in dark and secluded places, and eventually, unable to return to their burrows, they settle permanently and become a nuisance to people. When people cool off on summer nights, they may accidentally touch them and be stung. They are merely defending themselves, not intentionally stinging people, just like a bee sting. The ancients deeply understood physics and devised preventative measures. Before the first day of the fifth month, on the night before, they would sprinkle weathered lime around the corners of the doors and the bases of the walls to absorb moisture and prevent snakes and insects from hiding there. Once the lime absorbs moisture, it becomes caustic calcium, with the same effects as caustic soda and potash. It can burn the skin, and naked insects, upon encountering it, would feel severe pain and dare not approach. On the fifth day, at noon, they would burn Atractylodes lancea and Angelica dahurica in a charcoal basin to create smoke to fumigate the rooms. They would also mix realgar with liquor to sprinkle around the four corners. All of these measures were intended to prevent poisonous insects from entering the house. The carbon dioxide was used as a disinfectant, Atractylodes lancea dries dampness, Angelica dahurica kills insects, and realgar contains arsenic, which has physical and chemical effects. Any insects about to move would smell these odors and fear being poisoned to death, so they would inevitably burrow back inside. Even if they did not suffocate to death, they would retreat further down, unable to escape. After this time, when the sun shifted to the west, any direct paths and pores would no longer receive sunlight, and all the accumulated vapor would naturally evaporate completely. As long as the dwelling is comfortable, they would not think of moving to a better place. As for hanging calamus and mugwort on the doors, this is to prevent external spider webs from entering the room, avoiding the sun. Garlic is also hung on the lintel of the bed curtain, because the smell of garlic can ward off mosquitoes and flies, and it can also be used for acupuncture during illness. Generally, acupuncture always uses moxa, and water acupuncture uses garlic slices as a compress instead of needles. Women often apply garlic slices to their temples on the Dragon Boat Festival to treat headaches, or if they suffer from chronic tuberculosis, they apply garlic paste to the spine, called water acupuncture, which is the same principle as Western medicine's use of drawing agents. To draw out illness, one must use drawing agents. Blister beetles are poisonous, so garlic is preferred for its stability and convenience. Coating children's foreheads with realgar is to prevent sores and boils, and drinking realgar wine is to prevent summer cold drinks from easily causing E. coli. This is all because it contains arsenic, which is the same principle as Western medicine's use of serum injections, and it also benefits travelers. Anyone suffering from heatstroke can take any calamus or mugwort hanging at a door, mix it with water, and drink it to save themselves in an emergency. Willow branches are inserted during Qingming Festival and are replaced during the Dragon Boat Festival. The use of willow branches is to extract the salicylic acid they contain, which can treat smallpox. Those suffering from smallpox often contract wind-cold, which prevents the rash from coming out, causing blood poisoning and death. Bathing in a decoction of weeping willow can help the rash reappear, which is the same principle as Western medicine's use of salicylic acid.</p>

<h3>Summer Aestivation</h3>
<p>— Yao XingShu</p>
<p>The cold and warm weather has a significant impact on human health; People are more prone to illness in the hot summer, which everyone knows.</p>
<p>The most common illnesses in summer, such as acute gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, heatstroke, and boils, are in addition to the so-called summer aestivation.</p>
<p>What is summer aestivation? In the few new medical books I have at hand, I searched back and forth but couldn't find a corresponding medical term. Old medical texts say that summer aestivation is a common name for summer weakness: weakness refers to the softening and weakening of the hands and feet, with joints that are loose and uncontracted; when it occurs in the summer, it is called summer weakness. In Japanese folklore, it is called summer wasting, referring to the body becoming thin in the summer. Childhood memories are the most profound. When I was around ten years old, whenever summer came, I always had a poor appetite, a sallow and thin face, a dispirited mind, and a fondness for lying down; when the weather was cooler, my body felt much lighter. Older people would say this was summer aestivation. Other children and adults also experienced this.</p>
<p>Old medical texts say that the cause of summer aestivation is due to the weakness of the spleen and stomach, with damp heat and fluid retention. However, it doesn't explain why these symptoms don't occur in the cold season, which is a shortcoming. It turns out that the cold and heat of the climate have a close relationship with the physiological functions of the human body. Take the dogs we raise as an example. In winter, they often like to curl up. This is because the weather is cold, and they want to reduce the surface area of their bodies to minimize heat dissipation, so as to achieve the purpose of maintaining body temperature; but in summer, especially when it's hot, even if they lie on the ground, they naturally don't curl up. Their heads are often raised, their tongues hanging out, and they are constantly panting. Such stretching of their limbs and rapid breathing with mouths open and tongues out are meant to increase heat dissipation and prevent heat accumulation. This kind of life adaptation is visible; there are many more that we can't see.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the hot summer, the human body, because of the increase in temperature, undergoes various physiological adaptations to maintain a normal healthy state, which is undoubtedly imaginable. If this adaptive function is impaired by other factors, the body will naturally feel uncomfortable. In my personal opinion, the cause of summer aestivation lies in this.</p>
<p>Based on my personal childhood experience and observations after starting my medical practice, the symptoms of summer aestivation are: loss of appetite, weakness in the limbs, mental fatigue, laziness to work, dizziness, chest tightness, restlessness, weakened complexion, and weight loss. Such a rough and simplistic observation is truly laughable; however, in my current environment, even if I encounter patients with summer aestivation, it is very difficult to conduct more detailed examinations to enrich my descriptions.</p>
<p>We must not deny the existence of summer aestivation in our country simply because there is no record of summer aestivation in the literature of advanced medical countries. As citizens of the Republic of China, we should be responsible for researching diseases unique to China's climate and soil. If we read a few foreign medical books and ignore the inherent diseases of our motherland, that is backwardness, not scientific medicine.</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease in old medical texts is to clear summer heat, nourish qi, strengthen the spleen, and support the stomach. My family has been in the medical profession for generations. When I was young and suffered terribly from summer aestivation every year, my father, although loving and caring for his son, didn't force me to take bitter medicine; when the weather was slightly cooler, or when the autumn breeze brought the summer heat away, I would completely recover my health. From this, it seems that this disease can be treated with expectant therapy.</p>
<p>According to my shallow understanding, although this disease is related to increased temperature, people who are physically weak, nervous, or have worms are more likely to develop it. Especially for children with summer aestivation, deworming should be paid attention to. This point comes from a bit of experience I gained from my son.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, relocation therapy is impractical, symptomatic drug therapy is meaningless. The most important thing is to eliminate the contributing factors, and improving summer lifestyle is the most important, which can prevent the occurrence of summer aestivation or reduce its symptoms. These are described below:</p>
<p>(1) You must take a bath once a day to keep your skin clean, so that the metabolic function of the skin is active. The temperature of the bath water depends on personal preference.</p>
<p>(2) If you have the opportunity and can tolerate it, taking a shower (shower head bath) once a day is also very good; residents in tropical areas must take a shower every day. Although the weather is so hot that it makes people tired, after taking a shower, you feel refreshed and your health is not impaired.</p>
<p>(3) The diet should be light, and fatty meats should be used less. Fatty foods can produce a large amount of heat in the human body, which is not needed in an environment where the temperature has already increased.</p>
<p>(4) You must get enough sleep at night. After it cools down in the evening, you should go to bed immediately, do not go out at night, go to bed early and get up early, and taking a nap can also help to revitalize the spirit.</p>
<p>(5) Drinks such as boiled water and light tea can be drunk in sufficient quantities. The supply of water has an important meaning for the dissipation of body heat. An appropriate amount of fruit is also very helpful for the intake of vitamins and the excretion of bowel movements.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the North Sea Islands of Germany (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ding HuiKang</p>
<p>It is very convenient for the people living on the island to take sea baths and perform air baths, because the beach is in front of their houses, and there is no need to travel far. The yellow sand is extremely soft, and it is safe for young children to bathe here. There are three sports fields on the entire island, some in sheltered forests.</p>
<p>The wind direction mostly comes from the west, and almost all of it is ocean air. The temperature of the seawater is easily heated. Sea bathing is possible in mid-May. In terms of air temperature, on December 15, 1933, the temperature in Triesden was 24 degrees below zero, while the temperature in Föhr Island was 2 degrees below zero. The coldest day on the island does not exceed 5 or 6 degrees below zero. From this point of view, the climate on the island is almost 20 degrees different from that on the mainland. As for the duration of sunlight exposure, it is also the longest among the German sanatoriums. For example, in December 1933, the duration of sunlight exposure was 64.6 hours. (Note that the weather in Northern Europe is often cloudy and rainy in winter, which is different from our country.)</p>
<p>The center of the island's sanatorium has a music pavilion, tennis court, golf course, shooting range, seal farm, sailing and other facilities. In addition, there are seventeen small villages on the island, all hidden deep in the forests, away from the world. The chapel, built in the 13th century, is a famous ancient monument. A cemetery is next to it, with flowers like brocade and dense shade, the scenery is very quiet. The island's museum has a very rich collection, including everything about geology, botany, zoology, history, and folk tales. The specimens of astronomy and marine climate are the most valuable. This is due to the lifelong perseverance of Dr. Haibeilin, the founder of the island, and it was not achieved overnight.</p>
<p>From a medical point of view, the air in this area is clean, contains moisture, and the climate has no drastic changes, which is very beneficial to the respiratory organs. Sea bathing and sunbathing can give the skin a longer temperature retention capacity. In terms of metabolism, although the consumption of human body heat (calories) almost doubles, the storage of protein, calcium, and phosphorus, which are the main substances of the human body, can be increased. Therefore, it can eliminate many allergic reactions. In other words, it can enhance the resistance to infectious diseases. According to experts on the island, the greatness of this resistance is almost the same as the function of diphtheria antitoxin in diphtheria.</p>
<p>From this point of view, (1) inflammatory conditions of the upper respiratory tract, nasal cavity, trachea, and bronchi, as well as bronchial asthma, (2) skin and glandular tuberculosis, bronchial tuberculosis, bone and joint diseases, (3) developmental disorders in children, general weakness, (4) poor digestion, loss of appetite, nervous gastritis, (5) anemia, nervous heart disorders, poor blood circulation, (6) overwork, and neurasthenia, (7) the recovery period after serious illnesses, especially respiratory diseases, are all suitable for the principles of marine therapy.</p>
<p>On the contrary, those who are not suitable for marine therapy include pulmonary tuberculosis, kidney and bladder diseases, heart diseases, malignant neoplasms, and epilepsy.</p>
<p>The duration of treatment is usually six weeks, but for chronic or stubborn inflammation, such as asthma, it takes three to six months. It is worth noting that the effectiveness of winter treatment on the island is such that in the winter of 1928, 3,650 people went to the island for treatment, most of whom were patients with inflammation that was difficult to treat in the mainland climate. Therefore, the island has a boast that the value of one winter is equal to two summers.</p>
<p>The island has a municipal management office, specialist physicians such as pediatricians, surgeons, and orthopedists, as well as pharmacies, dentists, sports rooms, sanatoriums, natural science research institutes, schools, kindergartens, seal halls, post offices, telegraph offices, and telephone bureaus. In terms of transportation, there are airplanes and ships. The cost of living is sufficient with four or five marks per day.</p>
<h3>Hamburg Children's Sanatorium on Föhr Island</h3>
<p>Historically, in the mid-17th century, the British physician Russel advocated that the ocean has therapeutic functions. Later, the French also agreed with him. The first marine hospital was established in 1792 in Margate. The German university professor Beneke founded the first German marine hospital on the island in 1881, which is today's Hamburg Children's Sanatorium. But within a few months, Beneke passed away. The physicians all came from London and Margate, which was the beginning of the introduction of marine therapy. During World War I, this kind of assistance disappeared completely. In 1921, Mr. Martini of Hamburg resolutely bought and rebuilt the hospital, such as winter treatment equipment, water and gas heating equipment, X-rays, and everything else that is indispensable for children's sanatoriums.</p>
<p>Indications All children suffering from chronic inflammation, glandular disease, tuberculosis other than of the lungs, bronchial asthma, general weakness, and developmental delay are suitable for marine therapy, but special attention must be paid to whether children with heart and neurological diseases can go for treatment. The hospital does not accept patients with serious illnesses.</p>
<p>Treatment methods The doctor's job is to determine the time for lying-down therapy. Sun lamps, Soolux lamps, air baths, sun baths, sea water baths, and cod liver oil are all commonly used treatment methods. Attention is also paid to nursing. Blood tests are also extremely important, and there is a chemical laboratory to manage them specifically.</p>
<p>The sources of therapeutic power, such as sunlight, wind power, and sea water, all have staff to pay attention to the time and quantity of their application.</p>
<p>Treatment period From January to April is the winter treatment period, which can accommodate 100 children. From April to October is the summer treatment period, which can accommodate 270 children. From October to November is the autumn treatment period, which can accommodate 200 children. One treatment period in each period is 50 days. December of each year is a holiday period, so that all hospital staff can rest.</p>
<p>Treatment results Based on the weather and the original physical condition, generally speaking, each child can increase their height by one-tenth of a meter in a short time, and their weight can increase by an average of six to seven kilograms.</p>

<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(88) Pyelonephritis</p>
<p>What is pyelonephritis?</p>
<p>This is an inflammation in the renal pelvis of the kidney caused by the invasion of bacteria.</p>
<p>What kinds of bacteria can invade this area and cause inflammation?</p>
<p>Primary pyelonephritis is usually caused by the invasion of E. coli; secondary pyelonephritis is mostly caused by typhoid bacillus, influenza bacillus, or inflammation in neighboring organs. In addition, it can also be caused by stones or parasites in the renal pelvis.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms when pyelonephritis occurs?</p>
<p>The symptoms of pyelonephritis are nothing more than changes in urine, pain in the kidney area, fever, and neurological symptoms.</p>
<p>How does the urine change?</p>
<p>The patient's excreted urine contains pus cells and renal pelvic epithelial cells. The urine is acidic, voluminous and thin, and sometimes contains protein or blood.</p>
<p>What is the pain in the kidney area like?</p>
<p>There is spontaneous pain in the kidney area, or pain caused by pressure. The pain can be very severe, spreading to the ureter or bladder, but there may also be no pain at all.</p>
<p>What is the nature of the fever?</p>
<p>The patient has a fever that is not very regular; it is remittent, sometimes with chills and rigors leading to high fever.</p>
<p>What are the neurological symptoms?</p>
<p>Neurological symptoms include headache, delirium, and stupor. These symptoms are all due to kidney dysfunction, leading to blood poisoning and uremia.</p>
<p>How long does this disease usually last?</p>
<p>The course of pyelonephritis varies depending on the underlying disease. Cases secondary to puerperium, acute infectious diseases, or cystitis tend to have a faster course. Gonococcal pyelonephritis is mainly characterized by high fever and pain in the kidney area, and has a slower course.</p>
<p>How is pyelonephritis diagnosed?</p>
<p>It is only necessary to check the urine for pus cells and renal pelvic epithelium, and refer to whether there is pain in the kidney area, or perform cystoscopy, to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p>What is the treatment for pyelonephritis?</p>
<p>During the fever period, the patient should rest quietly in bed, with the upper body elevated. The diet should avoid irritating foods, and drink plenty of soups and beverages.</p>
<p>What methods should be used to treat local pain?</p>
<p>Apply warm compresses, warm damp cloths, or a hot water bottle.</p>
<p>What medications should be used for treatment?</p>
<p>Uva ursi decoction, hexamethylenetetramine, helmitol, salol, borovertin, trypaflavine and other agents can be used. Recently, the internal administration of acidic beverages has been used, which is said to be able to make the urine acidic and inhibit bacteria. Washing the renal pelvis with a 0.02% silver nitrate solution is also effective.</p>

<h3>Q &amp; A on Dental Knowledge (37)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 186) Why must one see a dentist for toothache?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the cause of toothache is difficult to find by oneself. It must be through the dentist's rigorous examination to know whether it is due to the disease of the teeth themselves, or the disease of the surrounding tissues of the teeth, or other diseases. What is the cause, and what method can be effective? Even when it comes to symptomatic treatment, it also varies according to the symptoms. Either external application, internal administration, or other methods should be adopted, which is not easy to decide on one's own.</p>
<p>(Question 187) If a dentist cannot be found temporarily, what expedient methods can be applied?</p>
<p>Answer: Severe toothache is indeed feared by everyone. If you cannot get treatment from a dentist temporarily and the pain is unbearable, you have to find a way to relieve the pain first. For local methods, rinse frequently with cold water. Adding some alcohol to the water and rinsing the inside of the mouth is also very effective. Or mix two grams of peppermint, twenty-four cc each of alcohol and Ida, and ninety cc of chloroform, and rub the painful part vigorously. Other methods, such as warm water bath and warm water foot bath, can also reduce pain. As for internal medicine, ready-made painkillers sold in pharmacies are generally reliable. Take them according to the instructions, and they will not be harmful. However, you must not continue to take them regularly because they are effective, to the point of overdose.</p>
<p>(Question 188) Are the toothache relief medicines sold in many markets effective?</p>
<p>Answer: This kind of lotion is mostly for external use, and it only provides temporary relief. It can never achieve the purpose of radical cure. Moreover, it is not effective for all kinds of toothache.</p>
<p>(Question 189) What should I do if I have severe toothache and cannot sleep?</p>
<p>Answer: Taking an appropriate amount of sleeping pills is beneficial and harmless. Generally, sleeping pills often have both pain-relieving effects.</p>
<p>(Question 190) How effective are the methods used in our country to treat toothache?</p>
<p>Answer: Chinese people have always had very little real understanding of dental problems. They think that all toothaches are caused by tooth worms, or virtual fire rising, or wind evil accumulation. Therefore, the treatment guidelines are mainly to catch tooth worms or take some wind-dispelling and dispersing or fire-clearing medicines. These methods have no value at all. The absurdity of catching tooth worms has been said before. As for sweat-inducing drugs, although they originally have the effect of relieving pain, it is useless if the real cause of toothache is not removed.</p>
<p>Section 6 Treatment of Other Dental Problems</p>
<p>(Question 191) What is an impacted tooth?</p>
<p>Answer: Any tooth that is hidden in the gums and has not yet grown out can be considered an impacted tooth.</p>
<p>(Question 192) Which impacted tooth is most likely to develop disease?</p>
<p>The one that tends to be is the last tooth inside the top, called the third molar, or wisdom tooth. It should have grown out at the age of eighteen or nineteen, but it is different from other teeth and often cannot grow out on time? Sometimes it is buried until it is thirty or forty years old before it comes out. There is also a layer that often hurts and is difficult to come out when it comes out, causing very severe symptoms.</p>
<p>(Question 193) How should impacted teeth be treated when they hurt and are difficult to come out?</p>
<p>Answer: If it is because the gums are too thick and not easy to break through, and therefore it hurts and is uneasy, just ask the dentist to find a way to cut open the gums, it will be easy to grow out, and the pain will be reduced immediately. But if it is because the position of the impacted tooth is crooked, or even lies horizontally, and it cannot grow out or cannot grow out completely due to the obstruction of the adjacent teeth, then you should ask the dentist to remove the impacted tooth as soon as possible, otherwise not only the pain cannot be stopped, but it is also easy to develop serious diseases. The surrounding tissues are inflamed by stimulation, often causing suppuration, unbearable swelling and pain, pulling the head and face, and the temporomandibular joint is tight, and the mouth cannot be opened. At this time, treatment is difficult, and it is necessary to wait for one or two weeks for the inflammation to subside and the mouth to be opened before treatment can be applied. However, the body has been greatly affected, and the hospital has been ruined.</p>
<p>(Question 194) Why is the removal of impacted teeth more difficult than ordinary teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Because part or all of it is buried in the alveolar bone, sometimes it is necessary to chisel open the alveolar bone, and sometimes it is necessary to drive the tooth into two sections before it can be taken out. Therefore, the operation is very troublesome, and the cost of the operation is also more than usual.</p>
<p>(Question 195) The occlusal surface without cavities sometimes feels sore and painful. How should it be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: For teeth that are maloccluded or have been rubbed for a long time, most of the enamel on the surface is consumed, and the yellowish dentin inside is exposed, so it can feel sore and painful. The treatment method is only to open the pulp chamber, remove the pulp, and then fill it, or simply drive away and fill the exposed dentin.</p>

<h3>World Recognized Beauty Medical Agent</h3>
<p>— (Cangshi)</p>
<p>Specializes in treating freckles and acne, functions to whiten skin, exquisite quality and effective—suitable for all seasons</p>
<p>There are so many beauty products that it is impossible to list them all. However, they are all vulgar rouge and vulgar powder, filling the market. At most, they are only for temporary application. Moreover, general inferior powders contain a large amount of lead, which is very harmful to the skin. Where is the beauty? As for beauty products that can also treat freckles and acne with special effects, it has never been heard of before. If there is one, it is the current "Mianli" cream. "Mianli" is a new invention in the modern scientific community. It is a fine beauty medical product developed through the research of many pharmacists and chemical verifications. Using it to treat freckles or acne has amazing speed effects. Regular use in all seasons can make the skin white and delicate. There is absolutely no disadvantage of irritation or damage to the skin.

<p>Ms. Yin from Lafayetted Road in this city has suffered from freckles since she was a child. Today, they are increasing. Now, during development, acne has also occurred. Young girls love beauty more than others. Ms. Yin often regards this as a painful thing. She has sought treatment in many ways without success. Her classmate Ms. Ye told her that "Mianli" can cure these two symptoms. Ms. Yin then bought two bottles from a Chinese and Western pharmacy. The acne was completely cured in more than ten days. In another week, the freckles gradually disappeared. Ms. Yin was very happy and repeatedly introduced it to her relatives and friends.</p>
<h3>Scabies</h3>
<p>— (Gengbai)</p>
<p>Scabies (commonly known as scabies) is caused by a kind of scabies mite invading human skin. It often penetrates under the stratum corneum or the stratum mucosum of the skin. Its hole is an irregular S-shape. The insect lives in it. The folds between our fingers are the places where the insect parasitizes the most. Other places such as the flexion surface of the wrist joint, the extension bend of the elbow joint, the front of the armpit, the genitals, the breasts, the groin, the knees, the soles of the feet, and the buttocks are all common sites for scabies. It is contagious. Its main symptoms are small rashes on the skin, or small blisters and small nodules. There is severe itching. The itching is even worse in a warm quilt at night. If you scratch it constantly with your fingers, it often causes strong eczema pustules that spread everywhere. Patients suffer a lot from it. Moreover, if scabies is treated with appropriate methods early, it is still not difficult to cure quickly. Otherwise, if the treatment is wrong, or if it is left to nature, it often takes a long time to heal. It may last for several years or even ten years. Moreover, transmission between families is not easy to avoid. Therefore, treatment should not be delayed. "Ganlu Lotion" is the most effective for treating scabies and ringworm. No matter what kind of scabies, eczema, or dampness, just one drop can stop the itching. Moreover, its insecticidal power is extremely strong, and it can directly penetrate the stratum corneum of the skin to exterminate the scabies mites in its holes. It is really the best fundamental treatment method.</p>
<p>(Note: "Ganlu" lotion is priced at one yuan per bottle. The Western Medicine Department of Shanghai Wing On and Sincere Company and major pharmacies in this city and other places all sell it.)</p>
<h3>Gonorrheal Epididymitis</h3>
<p>— (Liangyan)</p>
<p>During the period of acute gonorrhea or chronic gonorrhea, a sudden cold can cause a fever. At the same time, one side of the scrotum, either left or right, gradually feels swollen and painful. At this time, the body temperature gradually increases, and headache and stomach upset are felt. Urination is short and red. The testicles appear swollen and drooping. The swollen testicles can be two or three times larger. This is because gonococci have invaded the testicles, not a hernia. Hurry up and use the method to treat gonorrheal orchitis. Then you can suffer less pain. Moreover, people whose testicles have had problems will have problems with fertility. If it is treated early and the degree of inflammation of the testicles has not reached the extreme, then the problem of children will not be affected. The treatment method for gonorrheal orchitis. First, injections are needed. For example, white turbid mixed serum, etc. Second, electrotherapy is required. Such as short-wave diathermy electrotherapy, etc., can immediately have the effect of pain relief. Third, take antipyretic and diuretic drugs internally. Fourth, apply swelling-relieving ointment or lead sugar water, etc., and use a testicle support to tie up the testicles, which can reduce the weight and swelling and pain. The four methods mentioned above are the best methods for absolutely treating gonorrheal orchitis. All those who suffer from this disease can recover from their serious illness by following this treatment.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: If gonorrhea is prolonged, complications will inevitably occur. This gonorrheal epididymitis is the most common complication. The Father and Son Hospital in Shanghai has various electrotherapies to treat this disease. Not only do the symptoms quickly subside, but it can also completely eradicate gonococci. Therefore, those who seek treatment all recover quickly.)</p>
<h3>Stubborn Ringworm</h3>
<p>— (Jichao)</p>
<p>The cause of this disease is mostly due to water stains and unclean skin. If the skin is infiltrated by secretions and rubbed until it is moist and softened, it is easy to occur. Its parasitic organism is the same as the parasitic organism of a kind of creeping rash. Its nature is stubborn and difficult to cure. Its resistance is very strong. Therefore, it is called stubborn ringworm. The site of occurrence of this disease is mostly in the genital area and its surrounding area. It often starts from the inner thigh and the mons pubis, and then the navel, and then from top to bottom, reaching the perineum, buttocks, and sacrum, forming a large cycle. In addition, places such as the armpits and chest are also prone to occur. This disease progresses very slowly. The affected area is like a map. The edges have scaly eczema. The skin is mottled. It is extremely itchy. However, it is rarely contagious. And it only occurs in men. And its lingering difficulty in curing can last for decades. Therefore, to treat stubborn ringworm, you should use a good and medicinally correct agent. Recently, many doctors have quoted "Ganlu" lotion, and they have been able to achieve miraculous effects repeatedly. "Ganlu" has a strong bactericidal effect. Those who rest only need to apply it continuously four or five times a day, and they will all heal in a matter of days. There is no better method than this.</p>
<h3>Thank You (1) Letter</h3>
<p>— (Wang Zhaohuan from this city)</p>
<p>I suffer from acne. The number of acne that occurs on my head and face is more than any other patient. The color is initially red and gradually black, almost like measles in children. I often squeeze it open with my fingers. But the acne still does not go away. I feel very annoying. Later, I repeatedly saw the treatment method for acne published in your journal. I began to know that "Mianli" can cure this disease. I bought a bottle of "Mianli" cream that treats this disease from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company. I used it repeatedly.

<h3>Psoriasis</h3>
<p>— (Qiu Yuan)</p>
<p>Psoriasis, also known as scaly ringworm, is a very chronic neurotic skin disease. The common sites of this disease are the trunk, neck, extensor surfaces of the limbs, and the hair. And the extensor surfaces of the elbow and knee joints are very common. The course is slow. If it is not treated properly, it often lasts until old age. At the beginning of the disease, rashes appear on the skin, or small nodules, forming irregular circles. The color is red or brown. After a few days, silvery-white scales appear on the surface. If the scales are peeled off, there will be small blood spots on the skin surface. After entering, the surrounding gradually expands. Some are like copper coins. Some are like large silver coins. Some are also winding and tortuous. If it is not treated for a long time, it may affect the whole body. The scales on the affected area are sometimes light in the center. Sometimes they are thicker and denser. It is also itchy. The treatment of psoriasis includes internal administration, injection, and application. However, it is not as good as the external application of "Ganlu Lotion". It is the simplest and most effective. Ordinary patients with a part of psoriasis can be completely cured by applying "Ganlu" lotion, often in one or two weeks.</p>

<h3>Favus</h3>
<p>— (Yunsheng)</p>
<p>Favus is a kind of parasitic spherical filamentous blastomycete. It is divided into scalp favus, villous hair favus, and nail favus. Scalp favus is commonly known as ringworm. The parasitic bacteria of this disease are not only contagious between people, but also between people and chickens, mice, dogs, cats, rabbits, etc. They mostly invade the periphery of the hair follicles on the scalp. The villous hair and nails are less common. The affected area is characterized by the formation of favus scutula. The so-called favus scutula is a pure colony of favus fungus. It is formed around the hair shaft to form a hard, sulfur-colored dry scab. Sometimes it emits a strange odor. The hair then loses its luster. After a long time, all the hair in the resting area falls off. The skin gradually atrophies. Almost like baldness. Those that occur on the villous hair are very mild. Because the hair roots of the villous hair do not reach the deep part of the skin. Those that occur on the nails. The nails are thickened and have yellow spots. And if it affects the fingers. If favus is not treated for a long time, the affected area will have skin nipples atrophy. The hair will never grow back. Therefore, appropriate treatment should be sought early. The method is to apply a thicker layer of "Ganlu" lotion. Make the favus scutula at the scabbing site fall off. Continue to apply "Ganlu" for a few days, and it can be completely cured and the hair will regrow.</p>

<h3>Tinea Cruris</h3>
<p>— (Shou Chen)</p>
<p>Tinea cruris mostly occurs in the part of the skin of the thigh that is opposite and easily rubbed. It is a kind of chronic filamentous fungal disease. The pathogenic bacteria of this disease are small blastomyces. Their shape is woven and small. It is only one-third the size of pityriasis versicolor fungus. The collection is like a dense net. This fungus specializes in reproducing between the corneal cells with special qualities. Therefore, it mainly occurs in the inguinal area. It spreads to its nearby areas. The resting place is a light red or dark brown circular patch. The boundary between the common circumference and the healthy part is obvious. The subjective symptom is only itching. It is even worse when sweating. Among men in our country, those who suffer from it are the most. And it can be transmitted to others.

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>What will we report to the people of the country?</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The League of Nations meeting was held the other day, and the Ahuang attended the meeting and gave a painful speech. At first, he bitterly accused Italy of its cruelty and blamed the League of Nations for its incompetence. At the end of his speech, he said, What will I report to the people of the country? The listeners all applauded and sighed, which aroused general sympathy. However, the A country was finally destroyed. Even the debt-raising proposal put forward this time was rejected in full. It is feared that there will be no more opportunities to say a few words in the League of Nations General Assembly. According to the Paris telegram on the 5th, Swiss Federal Political Minister Muda has already informed Ahuang that after the League of Nations General Assembly has completed its work, he should be asked to leave the country within 24 hours. Paris's Echo reporter Bertina also sent out the same news from Geneva. The monarch of a destroyed country is despised everywhere and humiliated everywhere. As for this, if the people of a destroyed country, I don't know how they are treated by others.</p>
<p>A country is destroyed. Whether it can restore its old business and me in the future is a question that I will put aside for the time being. I will talk about the League of Nations again. A country is destroyed. The League of Nations can also be said to have died with it. Although the name of the League of Nations has not died, it is actually equal to death. Just look at the A representative reading a declaration in the League of Nations meeting the other day, saying, "Will the League of Nations abandon the invaded country and listen to the domination of the invaded country? The League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution on October 10 last year, announcing Italy's crimes and judging it as an aggressor. The iron case is as solid as a mountain and cannot be shaken. May I ask whether the resolution this time is consistent with the previous resolution?" This kind of tone, when heard by the member states of the League of Nations, is so heart-wrenching and so sad.</p>
<p>Dr. Qi previously published repeatedly in Independent Review, saying that the League of Nations can still raise its head. I don't know how the League of Nations can raise its head. This is really Dr.'s high opinion, which is not what Dr. can dream of. Since the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations has been seen through by people, saying that it is equal to a paper tiger. This deliberate A war has been seen through by people even more, saying that it is like a mud god in an ancient temple. Moreover, since the League of Nations has failed twice, the attacks of difficult problems are increasing. For example, the Danzig problem that is currently on the table may soon break up with the League of Nations. The problem of the merger of Germany and Austria, and the problem of the hegemony of the Mediterranean Sea will gradually arise, and each one will cause anxiety to the member states of the League of Nations. This is an unavoidable fact.</p>
<p>The League of Nations itself also feels the failure and difficulty of dealing with various environments. Therefore, it wants to reorganize the League of Nations, or wants to strengthen the power of the League of Nations. I say this is mostly nonsense. If you want to reorganize the League of Nations, it is originally possible, but it is also changing the soup without changing the medicine. If you want to strengthen the power of the League of Nations, you can wait until after the Second World War. Why is this? Those who ridicule the organization of the League of Nations say that it is a spoils-sharing agency. In fact, the League of Nations is enough to be worthy of this. If the spoils can be divided properly, then the current international chaos will not occur. In fact, the failure of the League of Nations is also the failure of Britain and France. Britain and France are the main members of the League of Nations. Because the ambitious countries now have wild ambitions, seeing the weakness of Britain and France's abilities and the inconsistency of interests, they want to rise up and transform into a new situation. Therefore, the chaos in the European situation is just beginning and is not yet on the wane.</p>
<p>What are the protagonists who want to overthrow the old situation and recreate the new forces? Then Germany and Italy are. According to a Rome telegram on the 5th, General Favalay, director of the Italian Ministry of Aviation, signed an aviation agreement with the German authorities on the 26th of last month. The effective period of the agreement is set at ten years, and it contains major significance in both economics and politics. If any one of the two countries disrupts the current situation, the League of Nations will be difficult to deal with. If Germany and Italy unite, countries such as Britain and France can really be chilled. Under the current situation, it is not only He country that is suffering from the pain of destruction. Those who follow A country and are defiled by violence are not few. Ahuang can also comfort himself.</p>
<h3>A Family</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>Evening fell, and thin, weak wisps of smoke rose from the fields. Dogs barked sparsely in the distance, once or twice. Mosquitoes buzzed, still swirling and biting at the sweat-soaked people just as they had ten or twenty years ago, sucking their blood. Very few families, as they had done three or five years ago, still brought their low bamboo stools to the threshing ground to eat soaked rice. The men's faces turned red from drinking, and the children, startled and uncomfortable by the adults' rough voices and the mosquitoes' bites, cried ceaselessly and chaotically. In summer, perhaps only from these "rare" fragments could one find that the village was still the old one, that the land was not new, strange, and ominous. However, in recent years, everything had become desolate and bleak. The years worsened year by year, and the people on this land could no longer live and reproduce in peace. Some were in prison, some were vaguely lost in the distance (perhaps permanently lost in another world), and some wandered in the docks of strange, "prosperous" cities... Everything had changed. Resentment and curses made people forget some of their innate emotions, and a terrible, fermenting life completely transformed—destroyed—them.</p>
<p>Granny Chang Geng was the first to be frightened by this "changed" world. She was nearly eighty years old and wanted nothing more than to have a "good death." However, desolation, cruelty, and decline attacked every small corner from the outside world. Even eighty-year-old Granny Chang Geng had been awakened by terrible nightmares many times. Her eyelids twitched, her heart raced, and according to her, that was not a "good omen." Her son, whom she had raised alone for thirty years, could not farm last year. He went to the city to carry bricks and tiles for someone, earning twelve copper coins a day. After working for two months, his body became increasingly gaunt and weak. When he walked and talked, he was constantly out of breath. After a month or so, the brick and tile shop in the city, feeling he couldn't do much work, abruptly dismissed him. Chang Geng cried and knelt, but it was no use. He finally came back, but after sleeping in bed for two days, on the third morning, he vomited a lot of phlegm. When they took it outside to look, it was all bloody red, terrible blood clots that had congealed...</p>
<p>Then, everything came to the last chapter of the book of life. Granny Chang Geng used her eighty-year-old, frail heart to laboriously finish reading it! All the hard work and suffering of the past decades were now equal to a deliberate all-in bet in a gamble, and she was destined to lose! Because, three months later, they reached the inevitable day: they could no longer find a way to make a living. The family ran out of food, and she could only cough and vomit blood. The young Mrs. Chang Geng resentfully left her three children, all under ten years old, and went to Shanghai with someone to "help people" (Note: Meaning to work as a maid). She felt that she could no longer find a comfortable life with that "consumptive ghost," so she decided to use her youth to try her foolish "fate" in the decadent big city.</p>
<p>Those desolate days dragged on for three days. Chang Geng suddenly started crying one night. Then, at dawn, he quietly threw the three children into the well at the stone bridge. When he returned, he looked at the sleeping Granny Chang Geng, knelt down quietly, kowtowed to her, and then hanged himself with a rope from the beam...</p>
<p>Everything had changed, but everything was also the old world! Now, the days were so terrifying, and it was unknown where this cruelty and ruthlessness came from. This was something that Granny Chang Geng and her contemporaries could not have imagined. Even more unimaginable was Granny Chang Geng herself. She had "cultivated" herself for a lifetime, endured a lifetime of suffering, but couldn't even manage to have a "good death." Neither she nor others would have believed that an eighty-year-old person would have to die by hanging, die in the water, and send off her children and grandchildren...</p>
<p>Granny Chang Geng finally died by hanging. She had cried for the old world, but this world was ultimately not the old one anymore...</p>
<h3>A Small Tempest</h3>
<p>— Si Er</p>
<p>The boss's first wife was always happy to scold people from morning till night, and today she was scolding even more vigorously. Her scolding was always the same: "Witch! Harlot! Sleeping with a man five nights a month isn't enough for you. I brought you in to be a maid, and I've been extraordinarily polite to you, but you still don't know what's good for you, and you always want to get the upper hand! Do you really want to force me to leave?..." But today, she added a lot of fresh curses to her tantrum:</p>
<p>"Rare! Rare! So you're capable of having a child!"</p>
<p>The concubine sat on the bed, unbuttoned her blouse, and held the baby to breastfeed. The boss leaned against the edge of the bed, holding a small teacup in his hand, stirring something. He frowned when he heard his wife's shouting, slowly raised his head to look at her standing angrily in the doorway, and said in a low voice,</p>
<p>"That's enough! Don't make such a scene. You like the child too. Bringing her in, we hoped to have a child soon to inherit the Wang family line, and now it's finally come true. Besides, it was your idea to bring her in, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Who likes her child! Who's quarreling with you! Can't I say a few words to her without you losing patience? Yes, the child is your darling treasure, but I don't care about him! I've already raised three children for your Wang family, haven't I?" The first wife pointed a finger at the boss.</p>
<p>"Yes, you raised three, but unfortunately, they all... Otherwise, why would we have brought her in?"</p>
<p>"They all died! It's because your Wang family doesn't have the fortune to keep children! How dare you say that?" She stamped her foot.</p>
<p>"No fortune to keep children? Haven't we gotten another one now, thanks to Heaven's blessing? That's why I advise you to be more generous and take good care of this child." He put the small teacup on the table, sat down on the edge of the bed, turned to look at the baby suckling, and asked the concubine, "Aren't you full yet?"</p>
<p>"..." The concubine didn't say anything, only turned her head away to show her impatience.</p>
<p>"Goo! Goo! Goo!" The baby cried in the concubine's arms.</p>
<p>"See how arrogant she's getting, that witch! Sometimes I tell her not to feed the baby too much, but she always ignores me." The first wife glared at the concubine.</p>
<p>"If you don't like the baby, why do you insist on interfering with whether she's full or not?" The concubine retorted.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You harlot! You have no respect for me now, daring to argue with me so boldly! Is the child really yours? Let me tell you: even though you gave birth to this child, he's from the Wang family line. You're raising him, but you're just lending your womb to give birth to him. He'll still be my heir in the future!" The first wife couldn't restrain herself, provoked by the concubine's words. She shouted loudly, rolled up her sleeves, strode towards the bed, snatched the baby from the concubine's arms, and ran out angrily: "You don't want me to interfere, but I insist on interfering, let's see what you do!"</p>
<p>The concubine collapsed on the bed in anger, and the boss just stared at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Goo! Goo! Goo!" A burst of the baby's cries drifted in from afar.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>That sound, passionate yet mournful, especially in the quiet and cold winter night. The cold lamplight shone on the snow, and the human figures imprinted on the snow were large and blurry. But they were moving step by step. Why were their palms red and swollen? Why were they trembling all over? Why did they not want a home, the warmth of home at night?</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll sell it to you. Just two more alleys and I'll be home, such cold weather." They said, exhaling puffs of hot air. I knew they loved their homes too, but they couldn't help walking on the road covered with thick snow. What were they busy with, you say? What were they doing it for?</p>
<p>In the morning, perhaps the snow was still falling. For those lying in warm blankets, this was the perfect time for reverie. But outside the door, there was the creaking sound of a waterwheel. A Shandong man was pushing a waterwheel. No need to ask what the weather was like, the entire wheel was covered in hard ice. This water carrier took off his carrying pole, hooked on the buckets, and carried the water in. Perhaps it wasn't even dawn yet, but he had to carry it and carry it, all the way until dusk. Weren't they tired? Weren't they annoyed? Why did they furrow their brows so tightly, as if they had endless hidden pain?</p>
<p>Looking out from the glass window of my room, in front of me was a large square, where many people were busy erecting beams, and many people were busy transporting sand and soil. Many people were standing on the high ridges, carrying tiles. From a distance, they looked as small as monkeys. This often reminded me of the monkey shows I watched in the countryside when I was a child. The monkeys wore red robes, wore masks, and spun around on a high bamboo pole. If a gust of wind came, wouldn't they be blown down? The plasterers were busy all day long. Perhaps they had seen their companions fall down, twitching hopelessly, and had even seen the gray-white brain matter. But they still had to climb up. Who said they didn't think about their own lives, their wives and children?</p>
<p>What were they all doing it for? If you asked them, they would surely answer that they didn't know. Yet they kept struggling on, day after day, until they stopped moving altogether, then they let go and handed their entrance ticket to life to God.</p>
<p>Is life like this? Why live like this?</p>
<h3>Loquat</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>Loquats have probably been on the market in the city for some time now, right? But in the countryside, now is just the time when loquats are ripening.</p>
<p>After spending many years mixed up in the city, happily eating loquats is just a matter of memory. This year in the countryside, when it was snowing in the spring, my family specifically told the workers to shake the spring snow off the loquat trees in the loquat orchard, saying that this year's loquats probably wouldn't be as good as last year's, because the frequent spring snow was harmful to the loquats. I thought to myself, this is fate, I'm in the countryside, but the spring snow is falling so heavily.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from home saying that the loquats were turning yellow, and that I had to come back this time no matter what. So I entrusted matters at school and took three days off, sat on a long-distance bus for two hours, and then stepped into my own home. As soon as my father saw me, he said, "The loquats aren't as good as they were last year, but they're not too bad, thanks to the workers shaking off the spring snow." I sat down and hadn't even finished a cup of tea when the workers had already placed many loquats on the table. I used the same skilled technique I had used more than ten years ago to peel the skin and swallow them whole, then swallowed one or two seeds immediately. I swallowed and swallowed until my stomach was a little bloated before stopping.</p>
<p>After lunch, I woke up from a nap, and the sun was already setting at a severe angle. I opened the back window and looked into the loquat orchard, and I saw that the countless golden loquats were like stars in the sky, with an indescribable beauty in the dark green foliage. I thought that to taste the true flavor, I had to climb the tree and pick them myself, so I quietly left through the back door and went to the loquat orchard to climb the loquat tree. After all, I hadn't climbed a tree in many years, so even though the loquat tree was easy to climb, I was a little afraid. I carefully grabbed the branches, stood firmly, then grabbed the branches again, moved my feet, and after doing this many times, I finally stood at the top. I poked my head out from the dark green foliage and looked down at the countless golden loquats from above. I leaned against the tree and picked the most golden-colored one, and still used the same skilled technique I had used more than ten years ago to peel the skin and swallow it whole, then spit out one or two seeds immediately. These seeds rustled against the countless branches and leaves a few times, lingered a few times, slipped a few times, and finally rolled onto the ground with a thud.</p>
<p>In the orchard, there were two kinds of loquats, one was red sand and the other was white sand. The skin and flesh of the red sand loquats were rotten red, and the taste was just sweet. The skin and flesh of the white sand loquats were light yellow, and the taste was more delicious than the red sand loquats. To put it more precisely, the taste of red sand loquats was the taste of rotten brown sugar, while the taste of white sand loquats was the taste of snow-white sugar.</p>
<p>I climbed from the red sand loquat tree to the white sand loquat tree, swallowing one after another, until I finally couldn't swallow anymore. People who live in the city can eat the famous loquats from Dongting Mountain, but the flavor of standing on the tree yourself and picking and eating one yourself cannot be appreciated.</p>
<p>I am a weary traveler returning home, so in addition to resolving my longing for loquats, I also have a strong sense of sadness. Although it doesn't reach the point of "stroking old objects and shedding tears," a kind of melancholy nostalgia is enough to crush my fragile feelings. Recalling the things I did as a child more than ten years ago, secretly climbing the tree to steal loquats in the dusk and late at night for fear of my grandmother's scolding, is like a distant dream, blurry and faded, and other than leaving a bunch of intangible sorrow, there seems to be nothing left.</p>
<p>In the setting sun, in the dilapidated courtyard, only the loquat trees tell old stories. Now, my grandmother is dead, my mother is dead, and my siblings are dead. Only an old father is guarding the loquat trees. The loquat trees must also feel lonely, right?</p>
<p>I stayed at home for three days, and now I'm back at school, burying myself in my studies. Like saying goodbye to a long-lost friend, now I am missing the loquat trees. May they</p>
