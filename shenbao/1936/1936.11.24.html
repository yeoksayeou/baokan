<h3>綏戰之前途</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>自綏戰發生以來。全國人士。徹上徹下。悚息歛神。以注視此新動態之變化。誠以綏遠常國防之門戶。等咽喉之衝要。夙爲野心家視耽欲逐之標的。處心積慮以求遂其囊括之陰謀。設復保持不力。聽其淪喪。則一子失著。滿盤皆錯。唇亡齒寒。噬臍何及。所以必須集合舉國之力量。劍及屨及以赴危難者也。目前掌北門鎖鑰之責者。爲綏主席傳作義將軍。傅氏以苦戰耐守著稱。涿州一役。騰譽遐邇。景仰之忱。歷久彌殷。今使站在國防第一綫。上運其堅毅卓絕之籌略。以與匪偽叛逆相周旋。卽以過去英績。率厲部屬。已足披豁人心。磨讕士氣。矧當生死絕續之際。倍切敵愾同仇之念。餘勇可賈。滅此朝食。前錢將士一片壯烈果毅之氣概。雖在數千里外。亦不難想像得之矣。</p>
<p>抑於今回之事。吾人所引爲慰情聊勝者。又不僅前錢將士足饜喁望而已。地方長官之毀家紓難。舉國士庶之贏糧景從。無在不顯示愛國觀念之激發。逈非伊昔秦越漠視可比。而在救亡圖存一念驅使之下。不論爲按劍疾視之壯士。爲抱殘守缺之孱夫。罔勿作投袂之懷想。抱犧牲之宏願。此項意志之蔚成。允足爲吾人不甘瓦全之一證。蓋在重疊羈絆之下。舐糠及米之勢已成。無論若何法懦之民族。亦不容再作苟安旦夕之存念矣。自來邊疆大吏。一聞烽火之警。開宗明義第一章。卽爲向中央婪索軍費。論事實固所需要。言報銷欲難盡信。今則晋綏靖主任閣錫山氏。首先以其母命。斥貲八十七萬供億軍需。繼之者則有王靖國之助四萬。傅作義之捐五萬。趙戴文之萬五千。他如徐永昌。孫楚。楊澄源輩。並皆慷慨認捐。萬千不等。以效命疆塲之身手。作毀家紓難之壯舉。夫亦懍於局勢之日臻嚴重。深知非下必死之决心。終難希冀皮毛之並存。故不惜出此破釜沉舟之最後手段。以示守土禦侮之義無返顧耳。至於全國一致之踴躍輸邊。細大不遺之頻繁接濟。旣無政府功令之督促。亦非任何誘力相推動。純爲出於熱血之潮上。本其自救之觀威。遂如手足之捍頭目。風發泉湧而不能自止。甚至絕食斷炊。以示堅决。耐枵忍寒。以寄同情。凡此皆以見國人對於綏事關懷之殷切。絲毫不願其有放鬆之事實也。</p>
<p>前錢將領之沉著用命如彼。後方人士之熱烈援助如此。謂竟不能敵烏合之匪衆。誰實信之最近匪僞之。屢屢變更策略。某方之一再聲稱無關。蓋亦鑒於我方民氣蓬勃。士有死志。不能不採較審愼之步驟耳。惟吾人根據過去之經騐。深知非有統盤妥切之籌劃。實難期望禦侮力量之發展。晋綏將士。縱有决心。亦祗限於局部。曠日持久。何以爲繼。必調齊各方之軍隊。爲源源不絕之接濟。則瀰漫匪氛。方能一鼓殲滅。頃聞綏東形勢。已有展開傾向。中央軍準備開赴綏遠之部隊。已積極向目的地移動。果爾。則吾人之殷憂可釋。而壕間待敵之鬭士。聞此新訊之傳來。其興奮之情緒又何如乎。</p>

<p>自綏東戰事爆發以來、此間人士、因感於前綫我方士兵作戰之悲壯、以及處境之艱苦、爲表示後方人士擁護忠勇將士堅决守士起見、乃有普遍之援綏呼聲、在此呼聲中、種種精神與物質表現，本茶衆多、允以絕食·停火·募捐·等三事、爲最令人戚動深省、</p>
<p>（一）絕食　絕食運動開始提出時、一部人士尙抱有懷疑之處、以爲此向係獄囚抗議獄官某種待遇時所用之手段、如一見於昔年牛蘭夫婦要求同居、未得允准之時、一則見於本年天津監獄政治犯要求增加食物分量之時、若夫最近徐州獄囚之獻機捐欵、以及揚州獄囚捐欵援綏、亦用絕食節欵方法、實因彼輩身繫囹圄、本屬無錢可捐、故不得不出此手段、當作別論、若夫學生輩豐裕居多、儘可竭力輸將、無需提倡絕食運動、反覺矯枉過正、所節無多、而有傷健康、但多數意見、則以爲物質捐輸、固爲必要、然爲表示最大决心起見、實以絕食運動爲最有效、雖一人所節無多、但此係簡而易行者、凡係國民、人人可做、如能造成風氣、四萬五千萬人中、除前方將士外、均能絕食一日、則所得數目、亦殊可驚、况此種運動之最大意義、本在精神方面、對絕食者、可留極深刻印象、對一般國民、可予以絕大刺激，對前錢將士、可予無比之鼓勵、故其意義、實未可以節欵數目多寡計算、數日來、後派意見、大得一般人士贊同、是以絕食之事、各校已先後發動矣、</p>
<p>直至目前爲止、各校先後絕食一日者、將達十校、而减食粗劣食品（如窩窩頭之類）、以餘欵匯前方者、亦有數校、此中包含有大學·中學·小學·民衆學校·特種職業學校·以及補習學校等、無不應有盡有、而年齡方面、從三十歲至十歲左右之孩提、以及無分男女性別、一致參加、允爲令人感動、以此間過去事例而言、任何運動、能得如此普遍者、尚未前見、綏戰激人之深、於茲可見、</p>
<p>各校學生、大半來自中產以上家庭、平素豐衣足食、一旦絕食、則生理與心理上、呈何狀態、爲一極値注意之問題、記者曾遍赴各校查訪、並與參加絕食者談話、就大多數情形而論、絕食之第一頓、不過覺肚餓而已、至第二頓、卽覺腹內空空、渾身乏力、至第三頓、則身體疲軟、苦水時時泛溢喉頭、欲嘔而不出、此時如多喝白水或茶湯、則飢餓更甚、如不喝、則又腹內太形空虛、異常難受、其甚者、當夜至不能入睡、據一十歲之女生云、當大家舉行絕食至第二頓時、彼因飢餓難忍、曾數次擬背人以己蓄銅元二十枚、購零食果腹、但終於咬緊牙關、併此銅元二十枚、亦捐進校內援綏會中、記者聞竟、爲之感動不置、覩其一付天眞爛漫狀態、則又不免苦笑、在心理方面、因此係激於愛國心所致、凡參加者、起始均莫不興奮萬狀、至第二頓時、則入於沉着狀態、直至第三頓、悲抑之情、乃油然而起、故俟第二日復食時、此種印象、乃特別深刻、永留心頭、</p>
<p>各校絕食以及减食粗劣食品所得之欵、至目前約達千餘元左右、但其在精神方面之收穫、似絕非此區區數目所可表示、</p>
<p>（二）停火　此間一入冬季、經常氣候、溫度悉在攝氏零度左右、本年氣候、較往年稍暖、但月餘前、卽已開始結冰、立冬（本月六日）以來、氣候受朔風吹颭、更覺凜冽、十六日上午一時起大雪幾達十二小時、午間始停平地積雪數寸、全市住戶、早已按上火爐、蓋不如此、實不足抵抗寒威、明乎此、則各校學生舉行停火運動後、寒冷對彼等所加壓迫之嚴重、始可概見、照各校慣例、類於每年十一月初生火、至次年三月始撤、生火期約達四個月之久、而各校每日在媒炭方面之消費、合敎室·辦公室·以及學生宿舍等處計之、共數目亦頗可觀、此次綏戰爆發、學生羣興奮萬狀、除想盡方法從物質及精神方面援助外、更於絕食運動後、又想及此種剝奪身體溫暖之停火運動、以圖節省煤錢、匯寄前方將士、</p>
<p>停火運動提出後、立得各校學生之接受、紛紛各別舉行、且均得各校當局之同意、停火之期、由二星期至三數天不等、期內、所有校中辦公室·各敎室·各宿舍·甚至飯廳·厠所·悉皆停止生爐、全校由一遍溫暖頓成冰冷世界、各矗立天空之烟突、生火以來、本已終日禿禿冒烟不絕、至此、乃倏然停頓、景象荒凉之至、各校洗臉室中、傾水之溝漕、多有結薄冰者、</p>
<p>停火期內、各校學生表現之精神、異常良好、一切上課閱書等、經常工作、並未停頓、從未見有因此而縮手縮脚、露出畏寒之態者、且各種援綏活動、均皆加緊、各校學生、無不踴躍參加、男女學生、白日則悉出外或在校內募捐、晚間則在校內開座談會、或替前方將士縫製棉衣、凡此一切、均於冰點左右之溫度下進行、雖手足紅腫、口耳破裂、亦在所不計、於活潑熱烈之中、含有無限的沉着與嚴肅、</p>
<p>辦公室及敎室停火後、使各校之敎職員、均皆受到影響、但彼等亦均甚興奮、從不訴苦、記者曾詢某校年過七旬之敎授某、其時、彼正坐於敎員休息室中冷冰泳之沙發上、顫兢不已、覩之殊爲可憫、彼之雙耳爲重聽、記者以極大聲音連問數遍、彼始聽懂、孰知彼聽懂後、乃忽然正色云、「這是愛國的事、大家都能捱、我爲什麽不行」、言時、雖口氣堅决、但龍鐘之軀、顫慄益甚、記者肅然久之、統計各校以停火省出之媒費、已達數千元、數雖戔戔、但此係由於剝奪各校師生身體之溫暖而來、以此欵製成棉衣·皮衣·及手套等禦寒品、以贈前綫冰天雪地中之戰士、自亦有共特殊意義、</p>
<p>（三）募捐　募捐之事、在綏戰未爆發前、卽陸續進行、戰事爆發後乃更加由緩慢一變而爲急進、由無組織一變而爲有組織有計劃、截至目前、已用過之募捐方法、共有下列數種、（一）在校內向學生及敎職員全體募捐、（二）學生組成募捐隊、在街頭向行人·店舖·件戶·等募捐、（三）由各校敎職員發起、全體捐薪一日、（四）女生團體、紛紛籌辦遊藝會、以票價所得者捐匯前方、此外並有種種募捐方法、在建議之中、但尚未見採用、上列數方法中、見效最大欵數最多者、首推第三法、國立各大學、每校一日所捐、悉達千餘元、其次爲第二法、凡學生募捐隊所過之處、大率皆踴躍輸將、至於眞正一毛不拔者、乃少數中之少數、據數日來結果斷論、知識份子最爲慷慨、工人次之、住戶更次之、商人又次之、小官吏之屬、則最爲嗇吝、</p>
<p>總之、爲援助前錢作戰士兵起見、此間各校師生、正在竭力設法多募欵項、前日此間地方當局、雖有禁止學生街頭募捐之議、嗣經各校當局與地方富局接洽妥當、對於地方當局所顧慮之種種流弊、已均有補救辦法、在遵照此種種辦法下、全市學生之大募捐、卽將於二十二日全數出動、、（五）辦理米商登記、（六）調查海關進出口證明書、丙、第二區專員公署、得酌添人員、辦理管理及調查糧食事務、應需經費、准由總預備費項下動支、暫以二千元爲限、仍由專署造具預算送核、（廿二日）</p>

<h3>王寵惠　暢談綏事與外交　應否停止外交談判考慮　綏事依盟約可向國聯申訴</h3>
<p>前國際法庭法官　王寵惠博士、代表中央赴粤麥加胡故主席國葬典禮後　於月初北返抵滬後、迄今仍留滬上、立法院長孫科、曾於前午往訪、交換對於國事之意見、王氏昨晨在寓、接見新聲社記者、發表關於國事之談話如下、</p>
<p>寸土不能再讓</p>
<p>王氏答記者間、首談及匪偽軍內侵綏遠事、謂已失之領土未復、今復有匪偽之內侵、背景何在、世界咸知、此際吾人實不容再事退讓、雖寸土不能失、報載某國軍隊、由熱開向察綏、日方當局、雖猶一再否認參預綏事、須知參加爲一事、日方决不願公開承認爲一事、否則不啻宣戰、</p>
<p>停止談判止題</p>
<p>繼談、中日外交談判、現以綏事發生、是否應卽正式宣布停止談判、此須視張外長與　日大使過去已談判至何種程度、余因不悉內容、未便任意主張、昨日孫院長來訪、雖曾談及、渠亦因離京日久、不知其詳、吾人對於綏事與外交意見、在未經一番縝密研究前、尚無可向政府建議之處、</p>
<p>可向國聯申訴</p>
<p>旋記者叩以日本已退出國聯、綏事是否仍可向國聯申訴、王氏答、按照國聯盟的第十七條規定、自屬仍可提出國聯、惟國聯自處理九一　八事變失敗、最近對於意阿糾紛、又處理無效、國聯本身、威信已失、力量全無、此决若將綏事提出、有無結果、尚成問題、但國聯現方從事修改盟的、力圖自拔、盼能恢復舊日威信耳</p>
<p>德日同盟觀察</p>
<p>記者再叩以對於日同盟說之觀察、據謂關於此事、現德日雙方、均猶吾認、內容究竟如何、尚不可知、據余觀察、若果有此事、其內容定必複雜、不僅同盟而已、蓋日本無非欲藉歐洲之情勢、以牽制遠束也、王氏末表示、必要時、渠將晋京一行、惟一時尚無此準備、渠之鼻疾、益見痊可、現暫停醫治兩星期、再照射×光、視其是否完全痊愈、</p>

<h3>所得稅稅率　根據經濟情形頒訂　大美晚報評論實多隔膜　大陸報已著論加以反駁　所得稅事務處並不重視</h3>
<p>中央社云、財政部開徵所得稅、因事屬初創、故逐步辦理、而對於辦法之規定、不厭求詳、向各方徵集意見、日前央文大美晚報、載有社論、批評部頒之稅奉、而以美之情况、加以比較、頗多不合實情之處、英文大陸報繼卽撰文、加以反駁、記者昨特向所得稅事務處探詢、承詳爲說明、茲特錄述兩報之要點及其談話如下、</p>
<p>英文大美　晚報社論</p>
<p>本月十一日、英文大美晚報會著社論、對於新行中國所得稅制度頗有批評、並將美國菲律濱之稅制、系以圖表、詳加比較、綜其所詳、約分五點、一·中國所得稅制下利息所得、不論大小、一概課以百分之五之稅率、而薪給所得、其稅率反較利息爲重、（例如七百以上薪給所得、其稅率超過百分之五、二·中下薪給所得課稅稅率、增加過速、而高等薪給所得、反受優待、三·不顧納稅人家庭負担如何、免稅額槪列爲三十元、四·下級工作月薪在三十元以上者、如僕人·機械匠·汽車夫·抄寫員·店夥·等均不免稅、五·中國所得稅、每月微收費用浩大、恐所入不敷所出、</p>
<p>英文大陸　報之反駁</p>
<p>最近英文大陸報又載李屋論文、對於大美晚報所評之點痛加反駁、其要點亦如下列、一·中美經濟情形大不相同、兩國生活程度亦異、中國個人每月薪給所得、甚少超過一千五百元者、大美晚報所謂中下薪給所得、幾包括國內各級薪給所得、其隨所得額上升之增加率略同、可見最高薪給所得反受優待之說、全無根據、二·中國最低之個人、每月薪給所得、遠不及美國、美國薪給所得稅課稅起點、爲每月華幣一千元、中國個人每月薪給所得在一千元以下者、的占百分之九十五以上、若必以美國薪給所得爲標準、則中國將無施行薪給所得稅之可能、三·中國下級工作、如僕人機械匠等、個人每月薪給所得極少在免稅額（三十元）以上者、故實際上此類人等、均得免稅、四·中國採取扣繳制、雖按月徵收、而一切費用、極爲有限、五·中國個人月薪所得在七百元以上者、已寥寥無幾、在一千五百元以上者、可謂絕少、故薪給所得之稅率、其實際上最高度亦不過百分之五、大美晚報所二吾國所得稅對於利息薪給兩類所得待遇之不等、實不成問題、</p>
<p>所得稅事　務所意見</p>
<p>記者天雙方論戰、均關學術、會以此事訪問所得稅事務處某君、據言、兩報訊載、已予以深刻注意、若就其個人意見而言、則中國經濟程度、實與美菲兩國大有不同、大美晚報對於此點、未予細究、究因對於中國情形隔膜所致、中國家族制度財產制度、均與西不同、斷不能就上海或其他都市狀况、以例全國、例如人子無私財、係中國之舊禮敎、至今內地之大家庭及聚族而居者、尚守此美德、故壯丁食力之人、在歐美眼光爲自立者、其家之耄年父母爲依賴者、而在中國舊禮敎之眼光、則此壯丁爲依賴者、其經濟獨立之主權、尚均在其父母之手、此皆其明證、至勞働所得、其挽率應低於資本所得、雖是不易之論、但中國旣有租界、又有外國銀行、而外國銀行之存欵利息所得、能否一律徵收、尚未解決、倘中國立法、對於利息所得、亦採累進制、是不啻促中國資本逃避、而外國銀行反利此機會、以吸收資本也、（例如在中國銀行存欽普通利息四厘、在外國銀行存欵普通利息三厘、若中國利息所得稅超過一厘、則中國資本、必至有逃避之虞、）中國眼前僅就各種所得中、抽出三類所得、課以所得稅、課稅客體、旣非收入之全部、則個人生活必需費之减除、及依賴生活者担負之免稅、亦不能悉從歐美之例、總之、所得稅爲極繁複極科學之稅則、就各國所得稅史上進步、過程而言、均非能一蹴而、幾者、目下中國稅制、正與英國分類所得稅制相似將來自尚須逐步改進、外國學者論調、雖足資參考、究不足重視云、</p>

<h3>上海之搪瓷業　（續）　（上海工業槪况之卅八）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>一，華豐搪瓷股份有限公司——該廠部立於民國十七年，由劉鴻生等集股開辦，註册資本三十萬元，增加資本八千九百元，現任董事長爲李拔可氏，常務董事兼經理爲季直士氏，協理爲胡霖生氏。該廠工塲在浦東周家波，發行所設於老北門大街，過去曾與鑄豐等廠組織聯合營業所於愛多亞路，消除同業競爭，惟現已期滿撤消。該廠在浦東之基地約値十二·三萬元，廠內人小機器約値十二萬元，二十四座爐灶約値三萬五六千元，其他各種模型約値二萬餘元。該廠出品以面盆爲大宗，以「如意爲商標，營業額年有進展，近年來每年可達一百萬元左右，至營業盈虧，因時勢及競銷影響，則常有上下，去年結虧二五、二六八·一八元，本年營業，據估計似可獲微利。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （太玄）</p>
<p>人生的三部曲，把它縮小來賽喩，彷彿同走一座橋樑一樣；靑年的人如上橋，中年的人如跨上了橋面，老年的人如下橋。</p>
<p>上面幾句話，粗看去雖像老生常談一樣，如果你把它細細的回味一下，這的確含有極深長的意義。因爲在上橋的時候，一級一級的跨上去，第一須把脚步踏穩了走，不蹤等，不它騖，中途自無顚躓之虞。猶之靑年人在求學時期，專心一意的攻讀研習，從得寸進尺到竿頭日上，終於達到完成了它的舉業，這是人生第一部曲，也就是上橋的第一個階段。</p>
<p>在到了橋面上的時候，果然比較平坦了，猶之中年人到了學以致用時期，正可發揮出它的全能，來完成它一生最相常的事業。這是人生第二部曲，也就是上了橋面的第二個階段。</p>
<p>眼看着老年人在一步一步慢吞吞的下橋去，這無疑地在表示着它已精力就衰，需要着休息與快樂，這下橋的工作，也當然是人生最後一部曲了。橋，無論東西，南北，多可以往復的來回着，人，那裏能够返老還童呢？古人說：「少壯不努力，老大徒傷悲」。這實在是靑年人一種很好的警惕。</p>
<h3>東京的間諜笑話</h3>
<p>— 必力</p>
<p>近代的都市是間諜爭奇制勝的塲所。有的利用神妙的化裝術，有的利用秘密通信，有的利用美人的酒窩兒。友邦人是出名到各國去刺探各種秘密的，同時東京也有許多外來的間諜在活動着。所以東京警署的工作，無時不在緊張之中的。</p>
<p>有一天，有個女人呌大澤孃的自投警署，形色是非常之倉皇。伊向警署長報告說：「我的男人、永見近來形跡可疑，行踪恍惚。他常有莫斯科寄來的信報，但扃鎖非常秘密。我察出他有通俄間諜的嫌疑，因爲我愛我的祖國所以特來報告。他一星期前接得海參威來的信，便匆匆出去了，至今尚未回來。恐有重大事故，要請注意偵查」。</p>
<p>警署一得到這個報告，立刻緊張起來。先不動聲色的派探隨同大澤孃回家搜查。經過嚴密的檢查之下，除了在保險箱內搜出的一大疊莫斯科寄來的信之外便沒有什麼嫌疑了。永見是開一爿皮貨舖子的，在他的賬目中發見他虧空甚大。那些莫斯科來的信札，僅是些普通講到皮貨交易的話；但警署認爲頗有研究的價値，便帶回去偵查了。警署又向各地警局海關偵查，却並沒有永見這樣一個人出國。愈查愈無頭緒，愈無頭緒也愈見案情之重大。這樣的忙了四五天之後，永見終於被發見了。間諜巨犯就逮了。永見被警署人員發現在東京郊外森林中，人不像人，鬼不像鬼了。當他被捕以後，他的妻子大澤孃馬上趕到警局來，而案情也從此大白。大澤孃說：「我的男人實在不是間諜。近來他因爲營業失敗，虧空甚鉅，常常愁眉不展。一星期前他失踪了，我非常之焦急，又無法找他，所以佈置了他是間諜的局面而來報告警署，要警署人員特別出力找這個人。現在謝謝你們，已經把他找回來了。」</p>
<p>大間諜案便就此終結了。</p>
<h3>怎樣戴帽子？</h3>
<p>— 徐寄塵</p>
<p>南美玻里維亞地方，有一個大學的心理學敎授，名呌愛林娜。伊說：「我始終執着主義做我擇偶的標準：就是那個男子怎樣戴他的帽子？有好幾個男子喜歡把帽子戴側的，有的是向右傾，把耳朶都遮住了，這是一種狡猾易變的表示，這種人大都靠不住的；又有一種人把帽子戴在眼前，幾乎把眼睛也蓋住，這種人、終身不會冒險，他非常胆怯，永不能幹大事。試想一個男子比女子還胆小，尚堪稱爲丈夫嗎？也有一種把帽子戴得很後，讓面部和額角全露出來，這種人是鹵莽的，若和這種人結婚，須準備作寡婦，不然就得改嫁。一個男子必須把帽子戴得很正，不偏左右，不傾前後，才是我們女人擇偶的標凖。」</p>
<p>無疑的，我們跑到街上去看許多戴呢帽的男士們，總是三七式的，一副油腔。或是把帽子頂在頭頂連後腦都遮沒了，流氓，翹着大拇指，翻着衣袖管的人大都是這樣的，說他們是鹵莽」，當然很恰當。把帽子戴得端端正正，一舉一動，莫不循規蹈矩，自然是一個「正式人」的表徵。至於歪戴了帽子，或帽子蓋到眼皮，這樣人大概是年靑的，路上看見了女人，無論是一個或兩個，烏溜溜的眼珠子會從帽子邊射出一道火熖來；當然朝三暮四，不是終身依靠的人了！甚至有人戴了瓜皮帽，也斜在半邊，這種人不是戲院裏的案目，便是提着鳥籠的有閒階級，或是開書塲的老板，或者竟是靠山吃山靠水吃水的起碼人！</p>
<p>愛林娜女士上面的埋論對於我們是很有益的；雖不能說男人的戴帽子就是擇偶的金科玉律，然而有時我們覺得竟是十分靈騐的。</p>
<p>小姐們，企求幸福的小姐們，配偶的適當與否，是維繫着終身的悲歡的；假使要想獵獲一個多情多義的伴侶，第一步便應該把愛林娜的說話當作座右銘。</p>
<p>這是一篇戴帽子的哲學，也是戴帽子的藝術，哥兒姐見們，去細細咀嚼罷。</p>
<h3>嚮導員</h3>
<p>— 王瑜</p>
<p>這裏所說的嚮導員，却不是那些專以女人的色情來作引誘的一般變相賣滔；這些嚮導員是正式幹嚮導工作的，他們唯一的主顧是那些經過上海的外洋輪上的旅客們。</p>
<p>他們是沒有團體的，各自到海關行李檢查所處去，或到停泊巨輪的碼頭上去找尋主顧。穿着很漂亮的西裝，當走在甲板上聽到有人在說「上海倒是一個好地方呵」的時候，他就有禮貌地用一口流利的英語凑上去說：</p>
<p>「先生，我是上海的嚮導者，要不要我帶領你去遊覽啊？」</p>
<p>自然，那些旅客們對於這陌生的中國人是要懷疑的，况且聽說上海的騙子是很多的呢！於是他就會告訴旅客們：在岸上一切的用費，（譬如車費哪，）都由他來付給，直等你很滿意的遊罷蹄來後，再照數付還給他，此外就隨意給些」克姆賞是了。」</p>
<p>接到主顧之後，大都坐汽車出外，但是嚮導員是不肯化三塊錢一小時的車費給汽車行賺錢的，這一點，原來他早已和那些停在碼頭上的黑牌野鷄汽車接洽好了，車費自然得便宜些，但報賬給客人還是每小時三元，這不過是因爲他可以從中取利罷了。（未完）</p>
<h3>三捨身</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>這是我鄕的意見實事，主角是以為曾當過一任縣知事的千金四小姐。四小姐是目幼便在父母之命之下，締結着婚事的，但是不幸得很，在十年之前，四小姐十七歲時，伊的未婚夫，害病死了。伊受了這個刺激，更受着舊禮敎的浸潤，於是哭哭啼啼的鬧着要過鬥守節。當時頗爲伊的父母所反對，於是伊絕食，以爲要挾。後經親友的解勸，才算採取着執中的辦法，遁入空鬥。伊的父母允伊帶髮修行，但伊却堅持着須落髮，又以絕食爲要挾，伊的父母拗不過伊，只得任伊去落髮，取法名爲蓮音。</p>
<p>四小姐的出家，本不過是一時的衝動，待到落髮之後，晨鐘暮鼓，茹素參禪，生活的悽凉寂寞，自然不是伊所能忍受的。但伊還是硬在嘴上，苦在心裏，不過每逢伊的母親，前往探視時，伊總是眼淚鼻涕的黏了一臉。母親也滿懂得女兒的心理，所以時常的以言語挑動伊。老尼姑對於紳士人家的太太小姐，更是冉也知趣不過的，從旁吹噓着。道麽一年之後，四小姐是還俗了，回家而續髮擇配。</p>
<p>在二十歲上四小姐是與伊表兄，所介紹的一位新喪偶的小學校長打婚了。過了二月，迎娶有期了，不意那位小學校長，又因病死亡了。四小姐一氣，直哭了二夜，乘人不備，把靑絲又絞掉了，偷偷地又上那原來修行的庵裏去了。但是伊的母親，是捨不得女兒去當姑子的，所以央出了不少親戚來，向四小姐解勸，勸伊回家，再尋佳偶。四小姐執意不從。後來費了不少的唇舌，才說定了送伊到上海讀書，以求自立，而不再提婚嫁之事。</p>
<p>到了上海，寄宿在校裏，孜孜向學，進步極速。而且把已往的痛苦，也逐漸遺忘了。後來，竟逐漸地和一位同學的哥哥，由友誼而發生了戀愛。在三年前，當伊二十五歲時，竟正式結婚了。伊結婚時，我還會前往道賀，一對璧人，堪稱佳偶，婚後，夫婦的愛情，極佳。去年，產生一女。不意在今年的春間，愛女夭殤了，到了秋間，伊的丈夫，患傷寒不治而死了。這個刺激，自然比了以前二次更深了，於是伊遵　翁姑之勸，回歸母家去暫住，以節哀思。</p>
<p>但昨得消息，伊曾自殺而遇救，最近，又削髮而捨身於佛寺之間了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金的指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>夢蘭聽說，啊呀了一聲，表示很驚訝的意味。友梅道：啊呀什麽？我覺得這並不是人情以外的事。夢蘭道：論到送朋友一兩樣東西，這原算不得什麽。不過金戒指這樣東四，是不應當隨便送人的。友海道：當然，在我的意思。也不能認爲你是隨便的行爲。倘若你覺得這戒指不便出手的話，我代人送禮的，當然不能勉强，說着這話，就把手上這戒指，放在桌上。夢蘭將左手托住右手，看看自已原來帶戒指的那個無名指。微微的皺了眉，帶着笑容，緩緩的道：綸到彼此①氣相投，就送一枚戒指給他，那不算過分。若說彼此的交誼，只是書信往返，那就太淺了，我可以送他道樣自己佩帶的東西嗎？友梅笑道：若是那樣說，我父要班門弄斧了。以前我聽過兩個典故，有一個人會彈琴，讓一個人聽懂了。後來那人死了，他把琴也燒了。還有一個人，身上掛着寳劍，讓朋友看到了，很想。但是有君命在身，復送那朋友。後來他公事完了，那朋友已死，他就把寶劍掛在墳樹上。夢蘭笑道：那一個人，那一個人，接上說了七八個，我都鬧不淸。友梅笑道：你聽我說這話，你就當原諒我，我肚子裏本來沒有典故這得不能不說出來。你能不能學一學古人呢？夢蘭笑道：只是你這兩個譬喩不大吉祥。友梅道：所以啦。古人因爲當時沒有把寳劍送人，所以兆應不好。你立刻送出去了，就不　古人那樣得不着好結果了。夢蘭還是低了頭看自己的手指。沉吟很久很久，才道：旣是那麽說，你就拿去罷。（一〇一）</p>

<p>珠庵位於嘉興縣治之東南，去治不足十里，地偏僻，址狹小，不若城中精靈楞嚴兩寺之宏麗壯闊，然庵故有雙桂，數百年物也。淸咸同間，縣遭兵燹，舉儿召伯甘棠，故家喬木，毀傷摧折，鮮有存者，庵之桂，以僻在鄕村，得不夭斤斧，巋然獨存，歲月寢深，氣象益雄秀，庵以桂重，遂占邑中名勝之一，丙子建酉月，二十有三日，庭桂盛化，秋光晴麗，偶動淸興，遂獨步往遊焉。出南郭故址，循滬杭軌道旁南行，越橋三，下軌道，東南行，俄至一水，有石梁東西亘水上，是名蔣水橋。渡橋東南行，數折後，北視道旁，有紅牆小庵，顏曰祗園舍庵，土人簡稱曰舍庵，鄉背舍與晒同。過舍庵後，復東南行，道旁東望，有茂林村舍，曰薛家兜。步至此，不知前途去珠庵幾許，因入村覓人問訊。溪水濕洄，抱村環繞，四顧比戶掩關，悄無人跡，蓋未稼阮登，方勤收穫，村莊男女，盡在隴穆間也。旁皇間，隔溪遙望，有村童三二，就水濱嬉戲，急繞行至其處，欲就問。及近，則冀瞥見生客，如驚鴻，如駭鹿，穿林越澗，紛然四散。余高聲呼喚，檐下雙犬，獰猙若虎豹，聞聲驚起，狂吠突出，犬主聞聲出，呼喝之，兩犬乃貼耳搖尾去。因聞珠庵所在，則指東南松柏蒼翠中。隱露鱗鱗屋瓦，曰：此卽是矣。驚定神回，始循所指行，片晌，抵一石橋，曰莊後橋，溪流如帶，淸澈見底，登橋東南望，數丈外，瀕河結搆，樹木蕭疏，則卽珠庵是也。古香寒馥，已隨風而至，濃烈沁人心脾。下橋入庵，則地占三弓，粉垣四合，庭中雙桂，左右分列，行久足疲，乃就樹下小憇，凝神觀玩。見老幹虬枝，重重四出，蟠結如龍蛇，拳曲如股臂，苔蘚班駁，奇古殆難名狀，繩筧札縛，每樹共分五臺，層次井然，高下不相雜，翠葉紛披，黃金細散，時花正繁，因憶童時侍先王母掃墓過此，嘗入庵一遊，時庵有隣老，年六七十矣，爲道庵桂左右故二，左一樹，不知其年，右則老樹中萎，幼時親見補種，故其本差小，計翁言時，右樹之年，當與翁年相若，今又閱五十年許，則左一樹亦百年外矣。當時鳩竹戲遊之童子如余，今亦垂垂將老，去翁之年無幾，追憶前塵，惘然若失，因感賦七絕一章曰：曾從王母禮梵宮，金粟前身認雪鴻，五十年來無一事，珠庵雙桂又秋風，賦畢吟吟數過，蓋不勝此生蹉跎之感也。庵故有尼，今僅一老嫗，侍奉香火，客至，烹茶薦榼，能具主賓禮，余乃瞻仰佛象，周視殿廊，留連久之，始起別出庵。經後莊橋，見橋下東畔有古墓，規製崇宏，松柏葱鬱，離離衰草中，石碣屹然，就讀之，則題曰雙桂堂云云，異哉，地理之說，世人欵信者　　半，若此之巧合，其中殆有天也。故老相傳，庵址隸縣治巽維，由庵東南去，有竹田里，張叔未先生廷濟之故居也。先生以響學名海內，而父子均領浙闈解首，然終不得成進士，蓋桂之故事，本兆科名，花榮於秋，故亦只兆鄉闈，雙桂蓋亦張民橋梓之應也。舊聞乃如是，則所謂雙桂堂者，其後人殆亦得庵桂之蔭，曾佔巍科於當時乎？非所知矣。行行復行行，循故道迤邐歸，及至家正日之方中云</p>

<h3>東華第一循環末次賽　星期六對法商在逸園　勝負有關甲組錦標之得失　曁南葡萄牙星期日在申園</h3>
<p>本週末西聯足球最重之比賽爲東華對法商、星期六在逸園舉行、此爲東華第一循環之最末一次、過去成績、東華七勝一和、法商則爲六勝一和、因其尙有對沙吉爾一塲、法商當穩取勝利、</p>
<p>本屆甲組成績、依然不出前兩屆之形勢、其爲東華法商競奪錦標、已成必然之事實、觀乎法商陣容、較前兩屆得錦標時允爲强勁、以其才力平均、僄悍善戰故也、東華乃國人之精銳、人材集中、球藝已臻化境、惜原力不屬法商、此爲球迷一致代爲担憂者、以上次獻機祝壽表演賽、及日昨對臘克斯之戰、東華似難於克制法商、但如能鞏固防綫、前鋒卽謀兩翼之聯絡、亦不難取得勝利、東華奪標心切、必能善事圖之、</p>
<p>是次比賽、雖猶不足以言確定錦標之誰屬、而於錦標得失之關係、至為重大、本季聯賽將來之情勢、卽可於此得一綱要、</p>
<p>此外曁南對葡萄牙星期日在申園、葡曾以五比四勝西捕、而西捕復以二比四敗於曁南、以此推測、曁南不難連通三關、蓋該隊球藝、近來有顯著之進步、聯絡上頗有可觀、葡隊因考斯坦柯拉沙等之下野、實力大不如前矣、</p>

<h3>爲全國鄕鎭小學兒童健康問題呼籲（下）</h3>
<p>— 解玉衡</p>
<p>四，中國今日鄉鎭小學所需要的學校衛生</p>
<p>學校衛生爲兒童健康的保障，促進體格健全的工具，無論是都市小學或鄉鎭小學，都是一樣的需要，都市的學校與學生，因爲物質文明的環境可以帮助不少健康上保障的設施，各方面都比鄉鎭的小學與學生便利得多，衛生署統計都計都市小學的不健康人數，尙有百分之九十以上不健全，鄉鎭間沒有都市間那樣完美的醫院與衛生機關以及那樣多的醫務人員，簡直可以說鄉間就沒有，學校的敎員，只知道敎書，兒童的健康問題是無入顧及的，普及學校衛生的設施，爲兒童謀幸福，這種聲浪僅留滯在幾個都市上，兒童年過去了，兒童幸福委員會撤消了，鄕鈸兒童與都市兒童一樣的過着兒童年，但是度着兩樣不同的情景，都市兒童是由兒童年賜與不少的幸福事業，鄕鎭問兒童依然故我的在度着他們貧病交迫的生活，他們沒有失望，他們仍在慾望着有力的行政長官的憐憫之心，以政治的力量爲他們謀些幸福，尤其是急需的健康問題。</p>
<p>都市的學校衛生，因爲環境方面的協助，設施起來比較的容易，同時一般專家們醫學家以及護士小姐們，他們受着物質文明的薰陶，西洋文化的洗禮，愛慕都市的繁榮，同時都市中也可以隨時隨地給與他們自己的慾望上需要，所以都是居留在都市，都市小學衛生的設施，因此也就比鄕鎮間容易得多了，從人才上說，專門的人才留戀在都市，並不怎樣地影響鄕鎭小學衛生的設施，中國今日之鄕鎭小學衛生的設施，並不需要那些愛慕都市生活崇尙洋化的人才，他們不但不能適合農村的工作，並且容易使鄉鎭間的學牛受其薰染，弄得學生不安的鄕村，無能於城市，反而影響到敎育，曾有某市小學托作者爲其聘請學校衛生護士，作者以此項之人才須曾受專門訓練使能充任，故欲介紹曾受公共衛生訓練之護士，而商就於該校，該校以曾聘請同樣資格者充任而不合需要見却，因其在該校所作之衛生工作未能參入國情而實施，完全將一套西洋式的衛生公式在那裏實行，社會上發生輿論，處處走不通，且各方面不顧及學校之經濟，環境之改善，不從以少量經濟設法改良使其合於衛生原則着手，而以折除另行建築爲原則，無怪乎該校見到我介紹此次資格之人才時，而以不合需要見却呢？此項之衛生人才，在都市尙且不能容納，如何能够服務鄉村，鄕鎭小學之衛生一旦積極提倡推行，不免要公共衛生護士去協助工作，是問國內有幾處訓練機關，能供給此項適合農村工作的人材，無怪乎一般人說：「農村的衛生頗里要，但是人才頗難訓練，一個農村的衛生入員，比都市的要强得多，地位要高得多」。</p>
<p>實施鄉鎭小學的衛生，不但聘請人才是一伴困難的事，就是學校衛生的經濟也是一個極大的問題，專門人才是請不到，最低限度總要有一位公共偉生護士祖任若干學校衛生之指導，各省應開辦大規模的鄉鎭小學，學校衛生訓練班，訓練現任的鄕鎭小學敎員，凡是辦過學校衛生的人，沒有不感覺到學校衛生須要敎員自動辦理的，不但可以節省經費，並且可以增進工作的效率，如何能够訓練敎員適合鄉鎭小學衛生的需要，完全在乎主特訓練人的經騐與才能，鄉鎭間小學的衛生經費，應盡力避免向學生收取，每學期所需之衛牛費五六元卽足矣，學校衛生的設施，完全注重在衛生敎育及保健的工作，學校環境的改善，可以利用師生的活動，總之在訓練的時候，要注意到「適合鄉鎭的環境」，切不可把歐美式或東洋式的不合中國鄉鎭衛生授與鄉鎭的敎員，否則不但是經濟沒辦法，也是白白訓練一番，若是學校連一個藥箱都辦不起的話，敎育行政當局總應設法補助。</p>
<p>五，政治力量的推進</p>
<p>鄕鎭小學學校衛生的設施，直接間接對於中國的復興，都有很重要的關係，如何能够設法在最短期間促其實現，那完全在乎政治的力量去推進，只要政府把這伴事認眞的去辦，訂立實施的方針，以政治的力量嚴格推行，全國鄉鎮小學的兒童，不久並可以得到健康的保障。</p>
<p>查小學衛生設施方案，敎育部業已明令公佈，因爲缺少人才的關係，各地多未遵行，從這一點上觀察，我們爲全國鄕鎭小學兒童請求敎育當局，各省先行添辦鄉鎭小學衛生訓練班，訓練大量鄕鎭小學現任之敎員，敎育部應設置專員管理此事，各省敎育廳應有此項指導員之設立，並兼監督的責任，縣敎育局亦應有指導員之設立，學校衛生之觀察與視察學校行政及敎學一樣的並重，這樣學校衛生的設施有所督促，也不容許有所疏忽或者這樣的蔓延時日久不實現。</p>
<p>六，結論</p>
<p>從今日農村衛生工作上觀察，眞實的爲鄉鎭小學兒童謀健康保障者爲數太少，中國現在處於若何嚴重的時日，復興工作是若何的重要，我們絕對不能只顧及都市兒童健康問題，而忽略大多數鄉鎭小學兒童的健康問題，忽略了鄉鎭小學兒童的健康，也是等於忽視了復興中國的工作。</p>
<p>爲鄉鎭小學兒童健康問題呼籲者，日漸衆多，足以表現此項問題之重要，若足以靠着鄉鎭衛生去推行，這種蝸牛式的行走，是不適合生存於今日的時代，現况下的鄕鎭小學衛生，需要最短期間，普遍的實現。</p>
<p>訓練鄉鎭小學敎員充任學校衛生工作，不　是合乎國情，並可增加工作效率。</p>
<p>行政長官們！各專家們！兒童事業委員會諸公們！請你們爲鄕鎭小學兒童的健康問題謀一個解决。</p>
<h3>中國明日之護士職業建設問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>我們推動中國醫事事業的發展，不單是純粹的注重醫藥這方面的開拓，而忘掉護士學助產學三位一體的推動，這是一件很錯誤的事，近年來民間常與新醫界發生訟息之爭，涉訴公堂，這固然是一般民衆未認識醫藥眞理所致，缺乏醫藥衛牛常識所致，然而因護士技術之不良，護士態度之謙和而引起糾紛者，確也是重大原因之一，所以我們對於護士職業之倡導，護士敎育之革新，與革新醫學敎育有共同發展共同開拓唇當相關的重要，今將明日之中國護士職業建股問題，略述於後：</p>
<p>第一，護士學校獨立，爲基本的原則。</p>
<p>護士學校爲敎育護士人才的塲所，有着優良完善工作的塲所，然後才可以訓練人才而產生出理想的護士人才。這無疑的，護士學校非先獨立不可。護士學校獨立，護士一切行政主權和護士事業的推廣，庶幾可以確立了鞏固的基礎，基礎鞏固能如鐵石，然後就可以慢慢的發動護士職業和社會宣戰，而能使社會認識護士職業的意義與重要，那末，護士事業的前途，就會有進展的希望。</p>
<p>中國護士學校，看起來已有好多家在表面上是獨立了，然而實質上仍然是未獨立，學校中一切的主權，還是操縱在醫院的掌握內，這時我們也不能堅决地推翻現在的事實形成，因爲這是護士學校過渡時代的表徵，護士學校演進的過程。但是我們總不能使其永遠徘徊這過渡時代的護士世紀，至少有個最後的限度，總得要尋求我們護士學校的獨立時代，達到我們理想中的那一代。</p>
<p>理想護士化的那一代，這種偉大使命的引擎者，還整個繫於負着中國護士行政最高機關的護士敎育委員會。向中國敎育行政最高機關——敎育部——去努力求得貫澈，使其將護士職業爲重要的職業敎育一種。明令各省，市，至少限度得設立護士學校一所，與設施專科職業學校相提並論，以造就護士職業人才，謀護士職業發展，如果這種建設成功，中國各省市卽有護士學校的設立，雖邊睡區域，亦可享有護士職業的服務，造福於病者。護士職業達到普遍社會化之時，那末，護士事業的前途，才爲有力的把握可持，光明可露。</p>
<p>第二，護士學制建設，爲革新事業的酵素。</p>
<p>每一種職業，同是社會內的產物，何以區分某種職業是高尙尊貴的，某種職業是低微卑賤的，這可以說是，由於思想和學識所造成的分段，才有階級的區別啊。例如士木工程師與瓦木匠，不是同爲一樣的職業，共操一種目的之技能，何以土木工程師在社會地位顯然是尊貴，瓦木匠也是做的土木工程上工作而在社會地位反而認爲是低賤哩，顯然的可以給我們明確的一種答覆，前者受過嚴密知識的傳授，相當學藝的訓練，後者是知其然而不知其所以然的盲從工作，所以一種職業地位的高低，整個是由於智識的能力和敎育的程度，而註定自己職業的命運，我們是不能否認它，並且還要促進剛萌芽的護士職業，有一個醒惕啊。</p>
<p>我們知道，任何一種職業的訓練，總包含幾個階段的過程，例如高中師範科畢業，可以再至大學師範科或敎育學院，給其深造，謀敎育事業進一步之研究。</p>
<p>但我們再看一看護士職業學制的情形，高級護士職業學校畢業後，就沒有再深造的機緣，就是護士尋求知識最後之終點，入了死坑，壽終正寢了。</p>
<p>同時現在護士學校中的護士敎員，他們旣未曾受過相常師資的訓練，又缺乏實際敎學之技術，護生所得到智識的傳授，護病的技能，在無形中而渺茫，不能實際適應臨床護病的需要，解除病人之痛苦，所以訓練專門護士敎師，又將從何處產生出來哩，製造護士師查的人才哩。</p>

<h3>眼耳鼻喉疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一〇八）角膜</p>
<p>角膜俗稱眼黑。是構成眼球前部的一種透明膜。形狀爲帶橫橢圓形。前方彎曲。形成眼球表面的一部。它的直徑，爲十個米里米突。橫徑爲十一個米里米突。厚徑爲一個米里米突。角膜的組織構造。可以分爲五層。就是上皮細胞層（由磚狀上皮而成），前基底膜（或稱薄氏膜，爲菲薄無構造的透明膜），角膜固有層（就是實質層，由極細的結締織織維而成），後基底層（或稱台氏膜，爲無構造的彈力性薄膜），及內皮（由較大的扁平細胞而成）的五層。角膜的表面。常受淚液的濕潤。所以它的表面。常常保持滑澤。因此也就宜於光綫的射入及屈折。再者角膜的表面。在生理的時候。雖屬平滑。然若一旦發生病變。則呈粗糙。粗糙的稈度。常無一定。有時爲微細。有時爲粗大。完全依着病情的不同而異。角膜如果患有炎症或退行性變性。則必引起混濁。關於混濁的新鮮或陳舊，位於中央部或邊緣部，深層或淡層，有無物質的缺損及呈灰白色或帶黃色等等。對於疾病的診斷及治療上。均有緻密的關係。最可注意的。就是在新鮮混濁的時候。一般常伴刺戟症狀。患者自覺羞明，流淚，及疼痛。同時亦卽發生角膜周圍充血，眼球結膜浮腫，及前房蓄膿等症。</p>
<p>（一〇九）角膜炎</p>
<p>角膜炎的種類，頗多。它的病情。亦至爲複雜。角膜周圍充血，就是它的惟一主徵。在炎症的初期。卽可發生。在炎症劇烈的時候。上鞏膜，虹彩，及結膜。亦常發生充血。其他更若角膜混濁，血管新生，角膜潰瘍，及前房蓄膿等等。亦爲角膜炎的主要症候。茲特分別略述如左。</p>
<p>（一）角膜混濁－角膜混濁，是角膜炎的一種必發症狀。係由細胞浸潤而起。混濁的程度。槪依炎症的種類，及病勢的輕重而有不同。或似雲霧。或爲點狀。或成斑狀。在臨診上，可將混濁分爲三種。卽菲薄半透明者。稱爲角膜薄翳。稍濃呈灰白色者。稱爲角膜斑翳。濃厚呈白色者。稱爲角膜白斑。</p>
<p>（二）血管新生－在淺層角膜炎的時候。血管新生多由結膜而來。分佈於角膜的表面。多呈樹枝狀。在深層角膜炎的時候。血管新生多由鞏膜及葡萄膜而來。分佈於深部。多呈刷毛狀，或竹帚狀。</p>
<p>（三）角膜潰瘍－在角膜炎症劇烈的時候。組織常致崩壞。表面亦卽發生物質缺損。是卽所謂角膜潰瘍。</p>
<p>（四）前房蓄膿－發生潰瘍的化膿性角膜炎。它的前房內，常有蓄膿。膿汁呈黃白色。沈着於前房的底面。而呈半月形。上面則成水平面。</p>
<p>至於患者的自訴症候。則爲羞明，流淚，異物感，灼熱戚，疼痛，及視力障碍等等。</p>
<p>（一一〇）鼻腔的分泌液何以會增加</p>
<p>鼻腔的分泌物。就是一般所稱爲的鼻涕。在鼻腔健全無病的時侯。其量正常。旣不由鼻孔流出。又不向鼻咽腔流下。但是鼻腔如果一旦患有急性或慢性鼻炎，副鼻腔蓄膿症，血管運動神經性鼻炎，及鼻腔異物等病。則鼻液頓可增加。或由鼻孔流出。或向鼻咽腔流下。鼻液的性狀及多少。概因病原，病情，及時期而有差異。茲特分述如左。</p>
<p>（一）急性鼻炎（俗稱傷風）的初期。鼻粘膜乾燥。但是不久卽流多量漿液性的鼻液。經過相當的時日。再變爲粘稠性。最後則變爲膿性。而量亦卽著明减少。</p>
<p>（二）副鼻腔蓄膿症的分泌物。性狀不一。有漿液性，粘液性，及膿性等分別。由前部副鼻腔（上顎竇，前額竇，及前部篩骨蜂窩）所來的分泌物。多流人於中鼻道。由後部副鼻腔（蝴蝶竇及後部節骨蜂窩）所來的分泌物。多流入於嗅覺披裂。或向鼻咽腔流下。</p>
<p>（三）血管運動神經性鼻炎－是一種神經性疾患。爲發作性。祇有在發作的時侯。分泌多量漿液性的鼻液。醫學上，稱爲水樣鼻漏。鼻腔內，若有異物存在。則先由異物的刺戟。而來粘液分泌亢進。次卽變爲膿樣分泌物。往往且發惡臭。</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>旋花科Convolulaceae</p>
<p>一、旋花Calystegia　japoniea，Chois．</p>
<p>（植物）自生於原野，多年生蔓草也。葉互生，長柄，作箭狀長披針形，其端尖銳，有耳脚。夏日開淡紅色漏斗狀花。蒴果作球形。</p>
<p>（生藥）旋花Herba　Calysteiae，係採集其全草而乾燥之者也。</p>
<p>（成分）全草（風乾物）中含有在水中可溶性之物質爲30．7％葡萄糖爲17．5％（於稀酸中加熱後，增量至30％），灰分爲4．3％。又含有如Saponin之物質。</p>
<p>（藥理）用全草之煎劑，對於家兎血糖，檢視其影響，關於食餌性並副腎素過血糖，有顯明之抑制作用。</p>
<p>（藥用）舊說：旋花爲利尿藥，又醫疲勞，益精氣有效。</p>

<h3>參加江蘇省會棚戶佈種牛痘後</h3>
<p>— 殷白水</p>
<p>曾記得在今年的初夏，轟轟烈烈的鬧着今年是「霍亂年」，又高喊着說，尤其在長江流域一帶，流行得特別厲害，把一般民心驚得動盪起來，各衛生機關也忙得十分起勁，爲的是霍亂流行起來，委實太凶猛，太殘暴。在江蘇省會方面，有省會衛生事務所，用着全副的精神來宣傳，並聯合各衛生機關，作擴大的防疫注射，結果可算是勝利了，炎夏早已逝去，沒有聽到霍亂流行的噩耗，這點不得不歸功到預防的努力，和預防的價値。秋季雖沒有那「夏日可畏」，可是今年秋季的惡性瘧疾大流行，却威脅得每人在心驚膽怕，現在秋已辭別了人間，大家可深深地嘆口氣，來臨的冬季，春季，大家總以爲是太平的日子了，不要忘記！天花又將偸偸地迅速地在孼殖發鮮着，將拉開了陣綫，開始向人類進攻了，我們若不急起直追去預防——佈種牛痘——他的殘暴技倆，不但會使你變成醜形麻面，還得有生命的危險，看已往的事實，流行一次天花，便傷害了無數有爲的兒童！在國家方面，便喪失了莫大的元氣，在家庭方面，失去了唯一的生命綫。江蘇省會衛生事務所，早已看到這點，爲防患於未然計，除特的各大醫院及診所免費佈種牛痘外，並在十一月八日，敦請鎭江農村護士學校，全體學生分爲十隊，每隊由一衛生警領導着，到那指的棚戶，二十個區域裏，做種痘工作，同時做宣傳工作，但因人民見識愚昧，思想頑固，衛生敎育缺乏，所以困難很多，特借本刋一角之地，發表出來，望衛生當局，共同研究，以謀解决，同時將這次種痘後的心得，寫將出來，獻給大家，於他日不無輔助。</p>
<p>工作的困難</p>
<p>（一）因氣候寒冷，人民不願受種。</p>
<p>（二）以爲種土痘一次（舊式種痘）能終生無患，而種洋痘（牛痘）則不能，這種錯誤觀念的存在，因此造成已往舊式種過的，不願種第二次，沒有種過的，便請求舊式中醫。</p>
<p>（三）以爲種痘可以治病，你若說只能防天花，不能治病，便不願受種，你若要合他們心理應說能治病，則又違背衛生敎育。（未完）</p>

<h3>默繪地圖比賽</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>靑年會昨天舉行了一個默繪地圖比賽，比賽的辦法，據說是兩種，一種是在全國中擇定一省或數省，默繪出它的（一）佔全國經濟上重要地位者：（二）佔國防上重要關係者；（三）十地肥沃，適於移民者；（四）前途有重大發展性者：（五）物產豐富，輸出品多者，又一種則是在擇定一省或數省中，默繪出它的（一）河流：（二）山脈：（三）重要地名；（四）重要鐵路和航錢；（五）重要物產；（六）重要商埠，至於評判的標準，則將以準確，重要，整潔，完備與吾來决定。</p>
<p>這是一個非常有意義而又非常有興趣的比賽。說它有意義，我想這是用不到我來說明，讀者諸君們都會點頭首肯的；說它有興趣，則我想祗要眞正感到工作的愉快過的人也一定會體騐得出，要舉例證，則不妨以學校時代的考試來作例子，在學校時代，你要是對某一門的功課考得特別好，當你在考試的時候，以及在考畢之後，你的精神上的愉快實在是無法形容的，它不但抵償了你埋首案頭的辛苦，在那時候你就是想到孜孜地埋首案頭時的情形，那辛苦也會變成爲愉快。</p>
<p>但默繪地圖比賽又不類學校的考試，學校的考試，就算你是最好的一高材生」吧，也不見得是每門功課都是你所歡喜的，但爲了「畢業」或「升級」，却又不得不接受「塡鴨式」的功課，於是結果考試對於你不但不爲你所喜愛，有時却更會使你感到害怕，因之本來可以鼓舞你向上兢爭的考試，也因爲害怕厭惡而想設法逃避它了。</p>
<p>默繪地圖比賽的更大的好處，當然還在於他的意義方面，眞如牠的緣起所說那樣；「……吾人果放大眼光，謂國家卽吾人之大家庭，亦誰曰不宜。吾人對於家庭中之財產什物，皆應瞭如指掌，倘不能詳悉，則將失去生存之依據，而人民對於國家，處此險象環生之下，倘於地理形勢，山川險要，交通物產等，茫無所知，是何異於吾人雖有家庭而不能詳悉究有若干財物，則大好河山，終必淪胥以盡……」。</p>
<p>但是，我們願意在這裏再提出一個備忘錄，那就是像默繪地圖這樣的比賽，必須要使它做到普遍和深入兩方面，尤其是普遍方面，更應該立刻着手去做，卽使不能立刻使全國民衆知道全國的槪况，但像現在「國防第一綫」的幾個省份內的交通，出產，和與全國的關係等等，也就應該讓他們槪念地明瞭。自然，方式是不必一定要他們默繪，用言語，用文字來傳達都可以。</p>
<h3>玻璃製造廠參觀記</h3>
<p>— 錫山</p>
<p>（本報特寫）玻璃之用途甚多，不論於日用的器皿上，醫學及化學的功用品上，都不能缺乏它，所以這是一椿很重要的工業。近年我國玻璃業的製造，雖已極形發達，但出品上尙未能完美，對於精美高貴之製品，仍見萎靡不振，故所需於國外玻璃品輸入者，每年仍達六百七十萬元左右。</p>
<p>我國製造鞁　的工廠，全國共有一百二十餘家，分佈於江蘇，浙江，福建，湖北，河南，山東等省，其中尤以上海一地爲最多。據最近統計，本市大小的玻璃製造業廠家，合計有三十六家，其總共的資本的在一百萬元之上，每年的產數亦在四百萬元左右，佔各地之首位，我爲要明瞭一些玻璃業製造的情形起見，日前特赴白利南路之晶華玻璃製造廠參觀。</p>
<p>晶華廠係本市玻璃製造業中規模較大的一家，故設備亦很完備，共大宗的出品爲瓶壳及水杯，盆，罩等。主要的原料爲海沙及碱粉等。此項原料，國內均有多數的產品，海沙，係向浙江之普陀及鎭海一處採運；碱粉則由中國永利造堿廠供給：因原料的良好，故出品尚稱優美，每月出品的總數，平均在十二萬元左右，佔本市同業的首位。</p>
<p>玻璃的製造程序，由原料至成品，共分爲五步：</p>
<p>（一）原料整理：玻璃製造的首步工作，爲原料之整理，因海沙在運來時，其中滿含水分，故先需將其置入烘爐中焙乾，待其全部的水　提出後，投入磨盤中，把它磨成爲極度細散的粉末，再將與碱粉等原料互相攪拌，使溶成同一成分後，始置入蒸氣爐中鎔燒。</p>
<p>（二）鎔燒：繼成料後的工作爲鎔燒。該廠共有蒸氣鎔爐三座，其中最大火爲瓶壳製造爐，它周圍的十丈。方，以火磚砌成，外塗以水泥及膠沙等因爐內熱度極高，平　常時在一千八百度左右，這樣可使其不致發生爆裂。於爐之高處有一口斗，已成之原料粉末，卽從斗口傾入，在經過了相當適合的鎔爐時間後，粉末便成爲一種火紅色之流液料，這樣，就能開始將其製型。</p>
<p>（三）製型：製型的機器，係相連於鎔爐的出口斗，它在製造時，完全能自動工作，所欲製器的模型，先置裝於機的四周，當開始製型時，把鎔爐的出口斗開放，使已鎔成後的流液料，分別的傾注於各模型中，模型在傾入一定容量的原料液後，模壳就自動向上上轉旋傾倒，使模內流液互相平均，待模型完具後，模壳便自動分開，把成型的器皿，列排自機中滾出。據說以此種機器製型，其產率很速，每分鐘可成型二十個，每日則連續可出品三萬個。</p>
<p>（四）成品：在玻璃器皿成型取出後，其熱度極高，如果置於溫度不均的空氣中，就很容易碎裂，故在成型後，另須置入溫度漸减的烘爐中，使其熱度漸次的改退。這個烘爐的面積長有四丈，高的六尺，爐內的熱度，自入口至出口，並不相等，係局部减低。最初的器型，置於熟度的最高處，慢慢的將其推移，及至出口，始相等於爐外的熱度，於是器型方能成品。</p>
<p>（五）修整，器皿在成品後，其中難免有不整者，故另須經過一番修整的手續，並檢騐其成分的是否淸澄，重量的是否平衡，模型是否正確等，其不合格者，便再行打成粉末，置入溶爐復鎔。</p>
<p>在產品的推銷方面，據云：每年之夏季比較上最爲淸淡之，後則產銷狀况，均見良好，然大部產品，如玻璃板，燈罩等，因製造不能精良，故難與市塲之舶來品相競爭。</p>
<h3>養鳥</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>偶然在朋友家裏看到了一頭芙蓉，我就想起了我的童年：昨天回來以後，我差不多做了一整夜的養鳥之夢。</p>
<p>養鳥，在我童年的過程中是佔着很重要的一頁的，因爲在故鄕的時候，我非常歡喜養鳥，雖然常常會因此而給母親靑駡，但我並不灰心；每天淸晨或傍晚，只要母親不看見，我便和弟弟兩個人，偸偸地帶着一隻「踏籠跑到禹王廟前去，把它吊在一株大柿子樹上，我們却悄悄地躱在一個柏樹墳裏，吹着一種捕鳥人所善用的哨子，等待着野鳥來入籠」</p>
<p>「踏籠」是一種捕鳥的利器，它也是竹絲製成的：方方的一隻，上面有兩扇天打門，下面亦有六扇機關門，在籠的中央是一隻媒頭籠，捕鳥的時候，先在媒頭籠裏放着一頭雌鳥，然後在每一扇門的仙人跳上，揷着一粒紅色的東西，像櫻桃，也像石榴子。這樣就可以將它掛到郊野的樹上去，讓那頭雌鳥在籠中去呌着，跳着，那些野鳥在這兒飛過時，看見了自己的同類在那兒招呼，又看見了這些可愛的紅櫻桃，於是牠們便高興的落在那籠上來了，但一個不提防，於個機關一翻身，牠就身不由中地跌入了牢籠裏。—其實·牠們是上了當了；中這紅櫻桃是石製的，或者是萬年靑子，</p>
<p>我們把「踏籠」掛在那株樹的高處，自己却屛息着蹲在柏樹墳裏守着，但說也奇怪，我們那口哨居然十分靈騐，只要噓噓的吹過一陣，每次總會有一大羣鳥飛過來，在附近的石榴樹上，桑樹上，及那株大柿子樹上跳着，呌着，很活潑，很快活，彷彿來找尋牠們的朋友一樣、那時我們的心是緊張着，只希望牠們快點跳到「踏籠」上去，立刻跌進了機關。</p>
<p>凡新捕來的鳥，因爲牠不服牢籠的綠故，總要不食不呌的在籠裏暴跳，想衝破了障礙逃出去；在那時，我們須將籠子用黑布包裹，不讓看見亮光，不然牠一定會跳死的，然而等上三四天，一習慣，牠也就安於這種生活了。</p>
<p>新鳥不慣籠中生活，因此凡捕來的鳥，必須先和老鳥同處一籠，待過若干時日，方可將牠們分龍。不過，我們養鳥的人都是重男輕女的，因爲雌鳥不善呌，除了做媒頭和敎食外，便沒有用處，而且大凡動物，皆是雌性比雄性美麗，然而禽鳥恰恰相反，雄性都活潑美麗，玲瓏可愛，並且又會唱歌，而雌性則祗會生蛋孵化，樣子却臃腫難看，呌起來也不大好聽。我們只要看鷄，就可證明我的詰並不是瞎話。</p>
<p>對於養鳥，我已有相當經騐，我能够鑒別鳥種的優劣，也知道鳥病的預防：盤槓，仰頭，跳底，聲濁，便是劣等的鳥，身細，眼修，毛緊，聲淸，那是上等的種。但我愛養秀眼；八哥，白頭翁却不歡喜，因爲秀眼愛淸潔，而且又文雅，不像八哥的會吵，也沒有白頭翁的汚穢。</p>
<p>每天，我除了上學堂外，將多餘的時間全消磨在養鳥上。早晨要帶了牠們到野外去散步，下午，要給牠們洗操換籠，但我很高興。弟弟，他自己雖不懂，可是也歡喜看我弄。母親他們，却不是反對我養爲，只是爲了怕「罪過」。</p>
<p>到了每年的春天，那我更高興極了，外面樹林裏的鳥呌着，我們籠裏的鳥也就很高興地唱起山歌來，一唱一和，那眞好聽呵。</p>
<p>可是，意外的事情終於發生了，那頭已養了五年而我最愛的秀眼，在一天我正到學堂裏去讀書之後，給人家　了去。這頭鳥，我直到現在遽時時在想者牠—</p>

<h3>冬初小品</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>（一）駝鈴</p>
<p>在淸晨，天還未黎明時，一些黃色龐大的生物們，跟着牠們的主人在早寒中啟行了。一頭尾隨着一頭，默默地跨着沉重的步子，背脊上抗着數百斤的重負，煤，石灰，木炭，柿子，……除這之外，還有大布袋裏的乾草，小布袋裏的饝饝，那是畜牲自己和牠主人的糧食。在走過了一個長長的路程之後，駱駝和人全餓了。便會寂然的停了下來，四隻茸茸的毛腿輕抖去灰塵，前膝慢慢跪倒，肚皮便也貼到地上，待主人把草料放到牠門眼前時，那麼然的厚唇開始蠕動，口未滴落到簸蘿邊，一雙軍沉的眼珠翻瞅着天。</p>
<p>頸項下的鈴子可可的搖着，除了駱駝的咬嚼與趕駝漢嚥食的嗆咳外，這脆嫩的響聲是唯一的音籟了。這音調是輕輕的廻蕩着，像水紋一樣播散開去，娛樂着畜牲自己，也娛樂着那啃嚥着饝饝的滿臉風霜的趕駝人。</p>
<p>在那空中飛揚着塵沙，不見邊際的沙漠海里，一串駝隊碰到了另一隊時，大家揮揮鞭子，趕駝人像騎兵隊的隊長一樣威武地，交換着一個互相關懹的笑顏。</p>
<p>「趕得早哇，哦，—眞是幾頭好牲口」。</p>
<p>趕駝人總如騎士愛端祥馬匹般，在留神着人家的牲口。</p>
<p>「百十來塊錢一頭哩！」</p>
<p>擺着皮帽上的耳蓋，昂然地走了過去。好像炫耀着自己的家財。</p>
<p>趕駝人也有僅僅是服役性質的，自己並沒有牲口，而是替駝隊的管主拉。在這類性質的駝隊中，聽不到多少駝鈴的聲音，只有一隊的第一隻的脖子下有，於是整隊的人和牲口便都聽着這點音響緩緩前行。降起的峯背上，麻布袋或繩網在不停的顚簸着。</p>
<p>「噓……」鞭子在空中揚了一下，漸漸鬆弛下來的脚又快了起來。</p>
<p>冬天的破曉中，人跟牲口在冰霜的冷空裏噴着熟氣，駝鈴漸漸的緩蕩着，這音波正暗示着一個堅毅的在征途中跋涉的心，不怕濃重的雪層，不怕漠漠無邊的沙海，輕飄的，在艱苦中吹回一點點廻音。</p>

<h3>南京將映「頑石點頭」</h3>
<p>童星茀雷巴塞羅密自從主演「塊肉餘生」以後，博得好譽不少。在大衆的心頭，總老是不能忘壞這個聰明伶俐的小孩子。「塊肉餘生」之後，接着他又主演不少的巨片，如「小伯爵」「春殘夢斷」等等，最近他又同好萊塢的第一流的小明星賈克古柏和密蓋羅南二人合演「頑石點頭」。故事是講三個天眞未罄的孩子，在某種的機緣之下，一起在一個小學裏做了同學，於是以這爲起點，生出許多可歌可泣催人同情之淚的事情來。導演是范逹克，名片「舊金山」的導演，本片中范逹克利用了明　的手法，輕描淡寫的將人世間最眞純最美妙的情感，像一幅動人的畫面般的展呈在我們面前，其手法之高超，是不容人不佩服的。該片是本年米高梅公司許多巨片中之一，已定於本星期四在南京大戲院公映云。</p>

<h3>The Pseudo-Army of Bailingmiao Moves Towards Wuchuan and Guyang; Prince De Leaves Jiabusi for Elsewhere; Bandits and Puppets Plan a General Offensive on North Sui; Bandit Li Constantly Harasses Our Defense Area, Attempting to Sever the Xinghe-Taolin Connection</h3>
<p>(Guihua) In recent days, a large number of pseudo-troops have been added to Bailingmiao, all arriving by car from the Houcaodi area. It is said that there is still a large number of pseudo-troops in the rear, which have not yet arrived at the temple. On the afternoon of the 23rd, thousands of pseudo-troops in Bailingmiao suddenly moved in two directions towards Wuchuan and Guyang, appearing to be launching a multi-pronged attack on Suiyuan and Baotou, with a fierce momentum. The Mongol and Han people are fleeing. Upon receiving the report, orders have been given to the garrison troops in Wuchuan and Guyang to meet the enemy in separate directions. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Prince De suddenly left Jiabusi for elsewhere, with many Mongols following him. Currently, military and political affairs are temporarily managed by a certain councilor. On the night of the 22nd, a certain commander and a certain councilor of the puppet government held a meeting in Shangdu, deciding to dispatch three bandit armies as the main force to invade Wuchuan, Guyang, and the area west of Baotou in northern Sui. The appointment of commanders has not yet been announced. However, according to the bandits and puppets, a general offensive on northern Sui will begin on the 27th. Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shihai are said to be responsible for commanding the attack on northern Sui. In recent days, the Rehe bandit army has continued to move to Duolun, with many soldiers from a certain side mixed in. More than a thousand reinforcements from Rehe arrived at Nanhouchang on the night of the 22nd. Furthermore, bandits and puppets secretly dispatched more than 30 plainclothes agents to lurk in Chaigoupu, plotting to sabotage the traffic on the Ping-Sui Railway. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that after the disintegration of Wang Ying's puppet army, reorganization will take time. The military power is now being redistributed. Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, and Zhang Junzhe of the puppet Rehe army are responsible for the frontal and flanking attacks and harassment of Wuchuan and Guyang. Li Shouxin is responsible for the frontal and flanking attacks and harassment of Xinghe and Taolin. Recently, Li has placed his rear defense headquarters near Nanhouchang, planning a major attack on Xinghe. At 11 p.m. on the 22nd, small cavalry units were constantly harassing our defense area in turn, with intermittent gunfire. Li's forces have recently increased to 30 tanks and 20 aircraft. In addition, the puppet Mongolian army of three regiments, three divisions of puppet infantry under Liu and Wang, and one brigade of the puppet Rehe army, totaling 20,000 men, are the main force, attempting to cut off the connection between Taolin and Xinghe. There will be a fierce battle in that area within days. On the evening of the 22nd, 60 large carts of grain and over a hundred boxes of ammunition, and 10 automobiles were transported from Zhangbei to Nanhouchang for the puppet army. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that by noon on the 23rd, Honggetu and Nanhouchang were both pacified. Our army is still on constant alert. Three bandit planes flew over our positions in the morning for reconnaissance but did not drop bombs. It is said that they will return to collect on the night of the 23rd, and military preparations are becoming increasingly complete. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that the puppet army has infiltrated from the Hetao area west of Sui and is constructing strong positions near Guyang. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that a certain side has established special agencies in Dalashan Banner, Enaji, and Pingliang, with Major Yokoyama in charge. Many officers from a certain country arrived last week and are active on the border between Sui, Ning, Gan, and Qing, forming plainclothes teams to disrupt our Northwest front. They also communicate military information with Changchun via radio every day. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources among the Mongols here, Prince De assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Mongolian Army on Thursday. At the same time, General Zhuo Shihai was also sworn in as Deputy Commander. Furthermore, it is said that Prince De and General Zhuo led troops from Zhabusu (transliteration) to Bailingmiao yesterday. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Suppression of Bandits in Sui Province began, the traffic on the Ping-Sui Railway has been extremely important. Now, troops stationed along the Sui border by the three provinces of Sui, Jin, and Cha are strictly guarding and protecting it. Bandit planes have been flying to the Pingdiquan and Zhuozishan area for reconnaissance in recent days. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Almost all American expatriates have withdrawn from Sui Province. Only one American of unknown surname remains in Baotou. In Guihua, there is a missionary of the China Inland Mission named Eckball. Furthermore, Mr. and Mrs. Lindhold are currently traveling from a town west of Baotou to Guihua. There are some Swedish expatriates in Guihua and other places. British or other foreign nationals, if any, are few and far between. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is now heard that the planes invading Chahar Province have changed their appearance to conceal their true identity. Most have painted their fuselages yellow and their wings red. The number of invading troops is far less than that of the defending troops, approximately in a ratio of one to five. If the defending troops order an attack, it will not be difficult to eliminate them quickly. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Duo Lun Conference: A Major Invasion of Sui</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain agency received a telegram from Zhangbei on the morning of the 23rd, stating that military leaders from a certain side are holding meetings in Duolun, Rehe, in recent days, planning a major invasion of Sui. A large number of fighter planes carrying many incendiary bombs have been transferred from a certain location to Duolun to await orders. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>No Trace of Bandits in Honggetu</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources concerned, more than ten bandit planes reconnoitered the Pingdiquan and Zhuozishan area for half an hour on the morning of the 23rd before leaving.

Residents of Honggetu fled together in the past because of bandit disturbances, but now there is no trace of bandits and it is being garrisoned by our army. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bandit Planes Fly to Xinghe and Drop Bombs</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, 17 planes flew over Xinghe yesterday for half an hour, dropping 12 bombs on a certain village, killing seven civilians. The Mongolian mixed army led by Wang Ying is still advancing towards northern Sui. It is widely believed that a general offensive will be launched on Wuchuan, 20 miles northwest of Guihua, within days. The news that the Central Army has entered Sui to assist the provincial army has been confirmed here. The news spread by the Japanese that Honggetu had fallen is baseless. In fact, none of the enemy's attacks on various points in eastern Sui have been successful, and all have been repelled by the defending troops. Professor Mei Yi-bao of Yenching University recently returned from an inspection of Sui Province. He stated that the climate in Sui is extremely cold, often below 15 degrees Fahrenheit, which greatly hinders the soldiers' operations. Gloves and coats are urgently needed to resist the severe cold. He also said that "the Manchu-Mongolian army fighting on the Chahar-Sui front totals 15,000 men, of which 12,000 are commanded by Zhang Haipeng and Li Shouxin. A Suiyuan Railway armored train collided with a freight train yesterday, injuring one signalman and three soldiers, causing traffic to be suspended for several hours. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>No Contact on the Eastern Sui Front Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) Concerned sources received a telegram from Jining today, stating that there was no contact on the eastern Sui front this morning. Only planes from a certain side came to reconnoiter our positions. Our army in northern Sui is advancing victoriously and is now less than 100 miles from Bailingmiao. According to reconnaissance reports, the number of puppet bandits gathered at Bailingmiao has reached 2,000 to 3,000, and they are extremely busy with troop movements in recent days. The troops from the temple have all left and will be replaced by puppet troops coming from Duolun. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japan Has Already Admitted to Assisting Bandits and Puppets</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from the Shanghai Guomin News Agency in New York on the 23rd, the Times here recently published a noteworthy message, namely that Kita Seiichi, military attache of the Japanese Embassy in China, recently stated to a reporter from that newspaper in Shanghai that Japan has indeed participated in the current situation in Inner Mongolia. The military attache also frankly admitted that Japanese officers had assisted the Mongolian puppet bandit forces currently concentrated in eastern Sui, and disclosed Japan's plan to divide Inner Mongolia, intending to place 17,000 square miles of Chinese territory under Japanese rule. It is said that reserve officers of the Japanese military department have established a large-scale military school in northern Chahar, specializing in training Mongolian soldiers. The salaries of Japanese officers are borne by the Mongols, but they do not participate in the war. As for the fact that Japan has sold aircraft to Inner Mongolia, Major General Kita said that it is also true. Rumors that Inner Mongolia is unable to purchase tanks, armored vehicles, and military supplies are incorrect, because Inner Mongolia has a rich harvest of opium, and military equipment is paid for with opium.

Your deployment and suppression of bandits must be very arduous. I regret that my humble body cannot come immediately. I send this telegram with longing, and I continue to hope for good news. Your brother, Li Liejun, urgently to Chairman Fu of Sui, The vast desert is icy, the borderlands are torn apart, the barbarian flute sounds mournfully, and the war drums are alarming. My brother proclaims great righteousness and encourages the heroes, causing the soldiers of the three armies to fight to the death.

<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial Week Ceremony; Chairman Shi Ying of the Central Government Presides and Delivers Report; Chairman Lin of the National Government Delivers Speech on the Grain Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At nine o'clock in the morning on the 3rd, the central government held the 51st Memorial Week ceremony. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Ju Zheng, Shi Ying, Jing Hengyi, Chu Minyi, Gan Naiguang, Ma Chaojun, Zhu Peide, Zhou Qigang, Xu Enzeng, Cheng Qian, Gu Zhenglun, Lin Yunhai, Li Wenfan, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Zhen, Hong Ludong, Zhang Qun, Hong Lanyou, Li Zonghuang, and others, as well as over 700 staff members, attended. Chairman Shi Ying presided over the ceremony. Following the formalities, he delivered a report on the progress of the Ministry of Personnel over the years, and the circumstances under which this Ministry dispatched personnel to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces to inspect personnel administration. The gist of his report was that the Ministry of Personnel began registering civil servants in May of the 23rd year and completed the process at the end of the 24th year. Currently, the legal regulations upon which the Ministry of Personnel relies for appointment reviews include, in addition to the Civil Servant Appointment Law, the Provisional Regulations for the Appointment of Civil Servants in Remote Provinces, the County Magistrate Appointment Law and its Implementation Measures for Appointment Qualification Standards, the Technical Personnel Appointment Law, and the Police Officer Appointment Law. Furthermore, as the central government's personnel regulations were not previously implemented in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, I consulted with the chairmen of the two provinces on remedial measures during this trip, which include: 1. Those who have not been screened and registered will be given a supplementary personnel review by the central government after proposed remedial measures are submitted. 2. Future appointments must comply with central government reviews. 3. Personnel review commissions will be organized in accordance with the law to handle appointment matters for those below the county government level. 4. Those who have passed examinations distributed by the central government will be appointed. Thus, the personnel review problem in Guangdong and Guangxi, which has been pending for many years, has been resolved. In addition, the personnel reviews of civil servants in Hunan and Hubei have also been agreed upon, and it has been decided that various central government personnel review regulations will be earnestly promoted in the future. After Chairman Shi finished his speech, the ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week ceremony on the 23rd morning.

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and then delivered a speech on the "Grain Issue." He first referred to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, stating that the grain issue is not only a vital element of individual life but also a key to the survival of the nation. If there is no method to allocate and resolve it, the people will not be able to maintain their livelihoods, and the country will be in grave danger. This is true in normal times, but even more so in times of war. It is a fundamental issue. He stated that our country is an agricultural nation, and this year's harvests have been bountiful. Logically, the grain supply should not be a problem, so why does it now appear to be so serious? After detailed research, the crux of the matter, in addition to the lack of rain and difficulty in sowing wheat, lies in two causes: First, the production volume is inherently insufficient, and second, the distribution is still unreasonable. After a very detailed explanation of the reasons for the insufficient production and unreasonable distribution, he concluded by saying that we must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the third lecture of the Principle of Livelihood, which emphasizes increasing grain production and, at the same time, focusing on distribution methods, storing the surplus. This is the ancient system of public granaries. In addition to restoring and reorganizing them, we must also unite the entire country into a single economic unit so that there can be mutual exchange of goods within the country. In this way, the phenomenon of unreasonable distribution can be thoroughly reformed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Yuguan Japanese Army Captain Major Tanida Commits Suicide by Seppuku; Due to Negligence in Preventing the Mutiny of the Pro-Japanese Security Forces in Changli; Fearing Punishment, He Rashly Took His Own Life</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Major Tanida, the captain of the Japanese army in Shanhaiguan, committed suicide by seppuku on the 23rd due to negligence in preventing the mutiny of the pro-Japanese security forces. Han Zexin, the commander of the pro-Japanese Fourth Regiment, has escaped danger. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major Tanida was the garrison commander of the Qinyu-Changluan garrison. The mutiny of the pro-Japanese troops in Changli was a matter within his responsibilities. At 4 p.m. on the 23rd, he led his troops to attack, but he, fearing punishment, committed seppuku with a military sword in the wilderness of Dongyang Village, 20 li northwest of Yutian. He did not die immediately. At twelve o'clock, the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters dispatched Regiment Commander Kayashima, Adjutant Kawada, and eleven soldiers by special train to Tangshan for investigation. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is reported that Major Tanida, the commander of the Tangshan Japanese Military Police, who was responsible for the 400 security forces that mutinied in Changli, has committed suicide by seppuku.

<h3>Anti-Communist Bloc of Germany, Italy, and Japan; Unanimous Criticism from American Newspapers; Much Dissatisfaction in Sweden As Well</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a dispatch from the Shanghai National News Agency in New York on the 20th, the news of the German-Japanese alliance was met with unanimous condemnation from the press on the 19th. The New York Times commented on the German-Japanese alliance treaty, saying that it prompted Japan to join a new path of action, casting a shadow of continental disputes onto the Pacific, making it all the more difficult for the United States to sit idly by. The New York Post stated that the German-Italian-Japanese alliance was virtually for the sake of war. The New York Herald Tribune said that the United States must be seriously concerned about the German-Japanese agreement, as Japanese policy has long expressed resentment towards the United States. The New York Post's special editor, Mr. Lowe, stated that the German-Japanese alliance is contributing fascism to the world and preparing for an anti-Soviet war. An exclusive dispatch from London to the New York Times on the 18th stated that the London Times had published an editorial fiercely attacking the report on the Italian-German-Japanese anti-Communist alliance. London political circles widely cite it as a topic of discussion, recognizing it as the greatest rage ever expressed by the newspaper since it stood in the position of a small, thunderous god since its publication. The report also quoted the London Times as criticizing Germany and Italy, saying that the political record recently created by the two countries is characterized by irresponsibility, and their openly anti-Russian sentiments are undoubtedly erroneous. Now that Japan has officially taken the same path as the two countries, its ability to adjust its diplomatic policies has been greatly harmed. It also stated that Italy proposed openly approving Japan's actions that violate international obligations, and Japan has taken similar actions regarding Italy's violations of international obligations. Although there is not enough honor among thieves to speak of, there is no lack of mutual boasting. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Several major newspapers of the bourgeois class in the Swedish capital have always held a hostile attitude towards communism, but they have mostly slandered the recent reports of the formation of an anti-Communist group by Italy, Germany, and Japan, saying that this kind of anti-Communist group is actually a front for practical interests, only using an ideological front as a guise. The Daily News, the organ of the Liberal Party, said, "This move by Italy, Germany, and Japan will definitely not attract the participation of major democratic countries, because first, the democratic countries not only hate Bolshevism, but also hate National Socialism and Fascism; second, the weakening of Soviet national power is neither beneficial to Britain nor to France." The Stockholm Daily News said, "The organizers of the anti-Communist front are Italy, Germany, and Japan, but it is strange that there is no concern about Communist propaganda in these three countries. Even from a diplomatic point of view, does Japan think that communism is enough to harm Japan's position in China? Then it should know that Soviet Bolshevism has weak power in China and cannot gain a foothold. Do Germany and Italy think that communism is enough to harm the two countries' positions in Spain? Then Spain has a tendency towards anarcho-syndicalism, not communism. From this, it can be seen that the so-called anti-Communist front is just an anti-Russian front, a group of insatiable countries, and Germany is the first to start this." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Measures to Prohibit the Export of Grain; The Executive Yuan May Discuss It Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The separate measures established by various provinces and cities to prohibit the export of grain may be submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan on the 24th. According to general observations, the authorities will still maintain their old order that the domestic grain supply should be absolutely free to circulate. Because the departments concerned also disagree with prohibiting the export of grain in their review opinions on the case, if the review opinions are passed, the separate measures established by various provinces and cities to prohibit the export of grain will become ineffective. As for the issue of prohibiting the export of grain, it will be stipulated within the overall plan for coordinating the national grain supply, which was discussed and decided by the three special committees on legislation, finance, and economy of the Central Political Committee. It is heard that only this suggestion to prohibit exports has been sent to the Central Political Committee for reference, and the Executive Yuan is unlikely to make any decisions.

<h3>The Future Before the Suspension of Hostilities</h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the conflict in Suiyuan, the entire nation, from top to bottom, has been holding its breath, focusing its attention on the changes in this new development. This is because Suiyuan is a crucial gateway for national defense, akin to a vital passage. It has long been viewed as a target of desire by ambitious individuals, who have been plotting to achieve their sinister schemes of conquest. If we fail to maintain it and allow it to fall, a single misstep will lead to complete failure. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. Regret will be too late. Therefore, we must gather the strength of the entire nation and act swiftly to confront this crisis. Currently, General Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan, is responsible for guarding the northern gate. Fu is known for his tenacious resistance and defense. His performance in the Battle of Zhuozhou earned him widespread acclaim and lasting respect. Now that he is standing on the front line of national defense, applying his resolute and brilliant strategies to deal with the rebellious bandits, his past achievements alone are enough to inspire the people and boost morale. Moreover, at this critical juncture of survival, the soldiers are filled with hatred for the enemy and a shared sense of purpose. Their remaining strength is worth buying, and they will annihilate the enemy quickly. Even thousands of miles away, it is not difficult to imagine the heroic and resolute spirit of the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what we find comforting in this situation is not just the eager anticipation for the soldiers at the front. The local officials sacrificing their homes to alleviate the crisis and the common people enthusiastically following with food and supplies all demonstrate the arousal of patriotic sentiment, a stark contrast to the indifference of the past. Driven by the idea of national salvation and survival, whether they are brave warriors eager to fight or weak individuals holding on to what little they have, they all yearn to contribute and harbor grand aspirations of sacrifice. The formation of this will is sufficient proof that we are unwilling to surrender. Under the pressure of repeated constraints, the trend of mutual support has emerged. No matter how weak a nation may be, it cannot afford to dwell on short-term complacency. Historically, when border officials heard of alarms, their first priority was to demand military expenses from the central government. While such requests were indeed necessary, the accounting was often unreliable. Now, Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan, took the lead, following his mother's instructions, donating 870,000 yuan to supply the military. He was followed by Wang Jingguo, who contributed 40,000 yuan, Fu Zuoyi, who donated 50,000 yuan, and Zhao Daiwen, who gave 15,000 yuan. Others, such as Xu Yongchang, Sun Chu, and Yang Cheng Yuan, also generously pledged donations of varying amounts, demonstrating their dedication to defending the territory and their willingness to sacrifice their homes to alleviate the crisis. They are all keenly aware of the increasingly serious situation and deeply understand that without a resolute determination to fight to the death, it will be difficult to even preserve the most superficial aspects of the nation. Therefore, they have resorted to this last-ditch effort, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to defending the territory and resisting foreign aggression. As for the nationwide enthusiasm for supporting the border regions and the frequent assistance provided, both large and small, it is not driven by government orders or any external incentives, but purely by the surge of patriotic fervor and a sense of self-preservation. It is like hands and feet protecting the head and eyes, a spontaneous and unstoppable outpouring. Some even go without food to show their determination, enduring hunger and cold to express their sympathy. All of this demonstrates the people's deep concern for the situation in Suiyuan and their desire to ensure that no effort is spared.</p>
<p>With the commanders at the front so calm and dedicated and the people in the rear so enthusiastically supportive, who would believe that we cannot defeat a disorganized group of bandits? The repeated changes in tactics by the bandits and the repeated claims of non-involvement by a certain party are likely due to their awareness of our nation's vibrant spirit and the soldiers' determination to fight to the death, forcing them to adopt a more cautious approach. However, based on past experiences, we deeply understand that without a comprehensive and well-planned strategy, it will be difficult to develop our defensive capabilities. Even if the soldiers of Shanxi and Suiyuan are determined, their efforts are limited to local areas. How can they sustain this over a long period? We must mobilize troops from all sides and provide a continuous stream of supplies to completely eliminate the pervasive bandit atmosphere. Recently, we heard that the situation in eastern Suiyuan is developing, and the central government troops preparing to go to Suiyuan are actively moving towards their destination. If this is true, then our deep anxieties can be relieved. How excited will the soldiers in the trenches awaiting the enemy be when they hear this news?</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Another Reactionary Case Verdict: One German and Eight Russians Sentenced to Death; German Consul Implicated During Secret Trial; Germany Indignant and Considering Retaliation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The military tribunal of the Supreme Court today announced the verdict in the anti-government case, sentencing German Streckling and eight Russian accomplices to death. Streckling had previously admitted during the trial that he had been in contact with a German spy in Moscow a few months ago, planning to destroy a coal mine. Observers believe this is similar to the Vickers Company employee case in 1933. Whether Germany will retaliate is now a matter of general concern. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The foreign diplomat involved in the case of German engineer Stickling and eight Russians sentenced to death has now been revealed to be Groskopf, the former German consul in Novosibirsk, who has now been promoted to Consul General in Kiev. This matter was admitted by Shi during a secret trial, but its public release may cause serious diplomatic incidents. All nine defendants in this case will be executed by firing squad and their property confiscated according to the current verdict. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials here are awaiting the final report from German Ambassador to Moscow Schulenburg regarding the death sentence of German engineer Streckling in the Soviet Russian court in Novosibirsk before deciding on necessary actions. Some diplomatic circles here believe that Germany and Russia will not immediately break off relations. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Main Text of the Verdict</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The main text of the verdict in the case of the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary sabotage group at the Kemerovo mine in the Soviet Union is as follows:</p>
<p>"The preliminary investigation and trial records of the court confirm that the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary sabotage group engaged in criminal activities, establishing organizational links through Trotskyist members Noskov and Drobnis. Drobnis was one of the leaders of the Western Siberian Trotskyist secret organization, and his case will be tried separately. At the same time, organizational links were also established through Beigehanov and Sticklin, a German engineer at the Kemerovo mine and a defendant in this case, and Alimontov, who left the Soviet Union in 1935. The group's purpose was to undermine socialist construction and restore capitalism. They identified their primary task as carrying out sabotage activities to resist the Soviet state. They were directly guided by the Western Siberian Trotskyist Counter-Revolutionary Center, especially by Trotsky's confidants Mura Lov and Drobnis, who received instructions on carrying out sabotage and terrorist work from Pyatakov, Trotsky's closest aide and a member of the All-Union Trotskyist Center." The verdict then describes the group's destructive and criminal acts in the mine, stating, "The defendant, German engineer Sticklin, after receiving orders from a foreign intelligence agency, established a relationship with Beigehanov, whom he knew to be a saboteur, in 1934. With the aim of disrupting the management of the Kemerovo mine, he systematically instructed Beigehanov on sabotage tasks, delaying the construction of the Severnaya mine and undermining the development of the Telnaya mine. Sticklin proposed strengthening activities to Beigehanov to achieve greater results from the sabotage and, to this end, organized a counter-revolutionary sabotage group. This sabotage task was jointly carried out by Beige and other members of the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary sabotage group. In addition, Sticklin himself used sabotage methods to drill several mining holes in an attempt to obstruct the development of the mine and thereby disrupt coal mining. After being removed from his position at the mine, Sticklin instructed Beigehanov to continue the sabotage and even ordered him to explode the mines simultaneously. He also systematically reported his sabotage activities to representatives of a foreign intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Therefore, the crimes of Beigehanov, Noskov, Andreyev, Subin, Liashenkov, Kulov, Leonenko, and Kovalenko have been proven. They were members of the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary sabotage group at the Kemerovo mine and, under the direct leadership of the Western Siberian Trotskyist Center, carried out activities that endangered the Soviet state, in violation of Articles 58, 7, 9, and 11 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>The crime of Sticklin has also been proven. While serving as a mine supervisor at the Mailov mine, he accepted orders from a foreign intelligence agency. From 1934 to 1935, he repeatedly carried out sabotage activities himself and with the help of Beigehanov and other members of the counter-revolutionary sabotage group, intending to disrupt the work of the Kemerovo mine, which belongs to the Kuzbasugul, due to its economic and defense significance. He has violated Articles 58, 7, and 1 of the Criminal Code. Based on the aforementioned facts, the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentences Noskov, Subin, Kulov, Liashenkov, Andreyev, Kovalenko, Leongenko, Beigehanov, and Sticklin to be shot and all their private property confiscated. This verdict is final and cannot be appealed to the Review Court." (Tass, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Reaction</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It was announced here today that German Ambassador to Russia Schulenburg has again written to the Soviet Russian government, requesting that the defendants be given sufficient time to file an appeal. Shi's death sentence has aroused anger throughout Germany. The official German news agency even called the Soviet Russian action a "terrible repressive measure." (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It was learned here today that the German Embassy in Moscow has notified the Soviet Russian government that the charges against German Streckling of conspiring to sabotage and engage in espionage are unbelievable and demanded his immediate pardon. Newspapers here today reported that the trial was an unprecedented and unwarranted frame-up in the international community. The Soviet Russian action was nothing more than an attempt to create unrest in Europe. The German ambassador's request will be backed by the entire German nation. Germany will never allow its citizens to be falsely accused by a party-controlled judiciary. Furthermore, the Soviet Russian action was merely an attempt to blame others for the failure of its economic plans. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Syria Still Tense</h3>
<p>Disturbances broke out in the Syrian capital Tripoli the day before yesterday. The rioters even set up defenses in the city center, exchanging gunfire with the military police. Although the sound of gunfire has stopped after the military surrounded the area, the tense situation in the city has not eased. The cities of Beirut and Saida are peaceful. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Budget for Next Year Compiled; Totaling 3.04 Billion Yuan; An Increase of 730 Million Yuan Compared to This Year; Army Budget 720 Million Yuan; Navy Budget 680 Million Yuan; 980 Million Yuan in Public Bonds to be Issued</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army and Navy ministries have accepted the reduction of 102,000,000 yuan and 98,000,000 yuan respectively from their draft military budget for next year. The Ministry of Finance has decided to submit the national budget for review on Friday. The total amount may be reduced by 3,040,000,000 yuan compared to the requests from various ministries. However, the projected revenue is only 2,200,000,000 yuan, leaving a significant shortfall. It is said that 840,000,000 yuan in public bonds will be issued to make up the difference. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The most difficult hurdle in the budget for next year, the budgets of the Army, Navy, and Agriculture and Forestry ministries, was decided in outline on the 22nd. After the Ministry of Finance organizes the figures and sends them to print, it will be submitted to the cabinet for approval on the 27th. The budget for next year has become a massive amount of 3.04 billion yuan due to the increase of 223 million yuan in local finance grants for the Ministry of Home Affairs. This is an increase of 730 million yuan compared to this year's budget of 2.31 billion yuan. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The basic army budget decided yesterday is 330 million yuan. The second national defense plan in the new budget request includes 200 million yuan for next year's expenses, 180 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident, and 10 million yuan for general expenses, totaling 720 million yuan. The total cost of the second national defense plan is 2.7 billion yuan, of which 200 million yuan for next year's expenses will be used to enrich combat data, expand the air force, and improve the troops stationed in Manchuria. The six-year plan has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After overnight negotiations between the Ministry of Finance and the Navy and the Navy budget meeting on the 23rd, the navy budget for next year has been decided at a total of 680 million yuan (total budget request of 770 million yuan), an increase of 130 million yuan compared to this year's budget. The navy is generally satisfied because the Ministry of Finance has fully approved the completion year of the third replenishment plan, the root of the navy budget for next year, and the continuing expenses for subsequent years. The outline of the navy budget for next year is roughly as follows (unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>
<p>(1) Baseline budget: 430,000, including 180 million yuan for the final year of the second replenishment plan.</p>
<p>(2) New requests: 250,000, including 150 million yuan for the year of the third replenishment plan. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance's original plan for the 1937 budget has been decided by the Ministry of Finance meeting, namely the public bonds to be issued next year. The total amount of general and special accounts will reach 980 million yuan, which is quite close to the maximum limit of 1 billion yuan for current public bond digestion capacity explained by Finance Minister Baba in a special meeting. The huge amount of 980 million yuan in public bonds issued is unprecedented in Japanese financial history. Its contents include 830 million yuan for general accounts and 150 million yuan for special accounts, an increase of 127 million yuan for general accounts and 73 million yuan for special accounts compared to the 1936 budget. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the budget for next year decided by the government yesterday is as follows (in units of 1 million yuan):</p>
<p>Total budget: 3,040</p>
<p>Ordinary revenue: 2,200</p>
<p>(Ordinary revenue is divided as follows:)</p>
<p>Basic revenue: 1,590</p>
<p>Increased tax revenue: 423</p>
<p>Natural increase: 60</p>
<p>Increased tariff revenue: 40</p>
<p>Pre-approved surplus: 10</p>
<p>Increased cigarette price revenue: 25</p>
<p>Special account surplus: 61</p>
<p>Public bond revenue: 830</p>
<p>The budgets of the Army, Navy, and Agriculture and Forestry ministries decided on the 22nd are as follows:</p>
<p>Army: 720</p>
<p>Navy: 680</p>
<p>Agriculture and Forestry: 130</p>
<p>(Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The compilation of the budget for next year, which was expected to be difficult to resolve, proceeded unexpectedly smoothly. The unprecedentedly large budget of 3.04 billion yuan can be resolved at the budget cabinet meeting on the 27th without the need for political compromises, as in previous years. As a result, the government is relieved. However, the government will make every effort to resolve outstanding issues. For example, the four-minister meeting on the reform of the central administrative organization will temporarily continue to adjourn after the third meeting decides on the outline of the state policy establishment agency because it is necessary to compile the budget. Starting next week, it will be re-evaluated and discussed in conjunction with the five-minister meeting. In addition, the parliamentary system investigation committee, which caused an uproar due to the Army Minister's attendance, and the House of Peers system investigation committee, which held its first general meeting, will officially begin discussions from next month. It can be seen that the political situation will enter a busy period as the end of the year approaches because of the imminent convening of the parliament. (Domei, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Spanish Civil War Raging; New Struggle Arises Among Nations; Germany and Russia Increase Warships to the Mediterranean Sea; Italy and Germany Deny Sending Submarines to Aid in Battle</h3>
<p>Constantine: The tense situation of international intervention in the Spanish Civil War is increasingly worrisome today. According to a radio announcement from the Bilbao government in Spain, the Soviet government has sent 35 warships to the Mediterranean Sea to protect Russian ships. Prior to this, the rebels had announced a blockade of the port, and it was rumored that a Soviet Russian merchant ship had been sunk by the Spanish rebels. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Italy and Germany have both denied reports that the submarines that attacked Spanish government warships in the port of Cartagena belonged to Italy and Germany. A German naval officer in Berlin told a Reuters reporter, "There is no trace of German submarines in Spanish territorial waters." Rome has also officially denied that the submarines belong to Italy. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Brest: It was learned today that three German warships sailed to the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) German Ambassador General Ribbentrop met with Prime Minister Baldwin at 10 Downing Street for 45 minutes yesterday. In the evening, the cabinet suddenly convened a meeting. Foreign Secretary Eden also went to Downing Street, spoke briefly, and returned to the Foreign Office to meet with the Spanish ambassador. It was reported that the ambassador informed him that he had received a telegram from the Madrid government stating that foreign submarines had bombed Spanish government warships. The French ambassador also visited Eden at the Foreign Office. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Ambassador Ribbentrop reportedly stated that Germany still pursues a policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and will continue to cooperate with the Non-Intervention Agreement Adjustment Committee. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Aviation Ministry has issued a communiqué stating that several submarines suddenly attacked government warships anchored at the entrance to the port of Cartagena in the southeast yesterday. The cruiser Cervantes was damaged, but the Monte Lauro was not hit. Since the rebels have no submarines, these submarines must belong to foreign fleets. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Valencia: According to a semi-official statement here today, Mallorca is now virtually a territory of Italy, used as a base to supply the Nationalist army with weapons to attack mainland Spain. The Nationalist army currently has 10,000 regular troops stationed on the island and has forcibly recruited 25,000 men to form a fascist army, commanded by Italian officers and equipped with Italy's latest weapons. Those who disobey orders are imprisoned or executed. Italian ships currently transport food and munitions to the island twice a week. In addition, fourteen Italian three-engine seaplanes and three destroyers are stationed in the port. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Non-Intervention Agreement Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to hold a meeting at 5:00 PM today. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian and German Chargés d'Affaires Have Arrived; Rebel Commander Pays High Respect</h3>
<p>Seville: The Nationalist army radio station here recently broadcast a message stating, "The newly appointed Italian and German Chargés d'Affaires arrived here today and were received by General Daria Nuo, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Nationalist army. The flags of Italy and Germany were hung in the city to express welcome. The two Chargés d'Affaires are scheduled to go to Burgos tomorrow to take office. In the port of Barcelona, Catalonia Autonomous Region, in the northeast, Soviet Russian officers and technicians are actively setting up defenses, such as building new-style trenches and setting up barbed wire, to prevent the Nationalist army from attacking." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the German government recognized the Spanish Nationalist army government, the military government appointed Tester Data, the original secretary of the German Embassy, as the chargé d'affaires to Germany. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Price, a reporter for the Daily Mail, was recently dispatched to Rome and Berlin to interview dignitaries from both countries. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano and several important German politicians have all made statements to him. Price summarized these statements and reached the following conclusion, stating that Italy and Germany will not hesitate to use force to assist the Spanish Nationalist army when necessary. He said, "The act of recognizing the Spanish Nationalist army government by Italy and Germany is attached with a promise, that is, if the Nationalist army is in danger of failure, the two countries will come out to assist it." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently published a commentary on the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist army government by Germany and Italy, expressing deep concern about the consequences that this move may cause. It said, "Although the governments of Germany and Italy are still continuing to cooperate with the Non-Intervention Agreement Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War, their rash actions are making it more difficult for the governments of various countries that are sincerely neutral in the committee. It would have been wiser for Germany and Italy to wait a little longer, at least until after the fall of Madrid, before proceeding with recognition. What the two countries have done now is less because of a thorough understanding of the situation and more because they are driven by emotion because of the same ideology. The effect is that if the Spanish Nationalist army fails to meet the expectations of Italy and Germany and fails to achieve victory, then the two countries' intervention in the Spanish Civil War will inevitably go further than it is now. This is where the crisis in the whole of Europe lies." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Close in on the Capital Center, Bombing with Artillery and Airplanes, Residents Flee Madrid, Unlikely to Occupy within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>(London) This dispatch from our special Reuters correspondent with the Spanish Nationalist Army states that after sixteen days of bombing Madrid, the Nationalist Army has secured an important stronghold. However, there is little hope of quickly occupying the capital. Several front-line observers estimate that the Nationalist Army will have to fight for two more weeks before they can occupy it. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Avila The Nationalist Army continued to make progress in their attack on Madrid on Sunday, but their advance was slow, as they had to occupy houses along the way in an orderly manner. It is reported that the Moorish soldiers have adopted special tactics for seizing houses. The first step is to rush into the ground floor of the house, then shoot into the ceiling to create large holes. Hand grenades are then thrown through the holes until the defenders withdraw. When encountering multi-story buildings, this method is used to occupy each floor until the entire building is cleared. This method has been used repeatedly and has been very effective, resulting in a significant increase in casualties. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid Suburbs Spanish Moroccan troops and foreign legionnaires occupied the northern suburbs of Madrid today. Street fighting with government troops occurred at the capital's sports ground, which is located there. The rebel forward command claims that the Capital Park has also been occupied, which is only two and a half miles from the center of Madrid. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid The rebels are now very close to the center of the capital and can shoot at the Modelo Prison with machine guns. However, government troops have repelled the rebels in the north and are shelling the university district in the west and the rebel-held former royal gardens in the south. At 6:10 this morning, rebel planes flew over the capital again and carried out bombing raids. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid Our special correspondent reports that a Nationalist Army plane flew over the capital this morning and dropped six or seven bombs in the central and northern districts, killing several civilians, including a child. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The report that the Spanish cruiser Cervantes was damaged has been confirmed by the Central destroyer Grauw. According to reports, a massive explosion occurred on the cruiser, resulting in the ship listing and having to be towed into port for repairs. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid The Nationalist Army heavily shelled the capital today but without using airplanes. It is claimed that the attack tonight was quite successful. The Modelo Prison has been reduced to ashes. Currently, the most advantageous factors for the government forces are the cold weather and their tanks. The Moorish soldiers in the Nationalist Army are particularly afraid of the cold. Even when wearing heavy coats, they lack fighting spirit. Every night after dark, the Nationalist Army uses searchlights to illuminate the Manzanares River and the bridges over it to detect any government army tanks attempting to cross the river. The government forces now have loudspeakers installed on armored vehicles, with a range of up to six miles. They are often driven to the front lines to conduct various types of propaganda against enemy soldiers. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid Rebel artillery heavily shelled key locations in the capital today, and passenger cars at the North Station were shattered. Residents screamed in panic and scurried through the streets. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid Almost all non-combatants will be evacuated from Madrid today to allow the defending forces to operate more freely and to provide some psychological relief. The scene of the refugees leaving the capital was extremely pitiful, as each had relatives and friends participating in the war and felt that this departure might be their last. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid Government officials are requisitioning various public vehicles today under rebel artillery fire, hoping to evacuate over 8,000 women, children, elderly, and disabled people from the city to the Prado Museum before midnight. It is estimated today that the number of civilians killed in the city has reached between 1,000 and 1,500, with about 3,000 wounded. Officials in charge of the evacuation say that if all the women, children, and non-combatants in the city were to be evacuated, the number would reach 200,000. They also said that government troops had recaptured the village of Nueva Carceda and the Velázquez building in the university district on Sunday. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Use Warships to Protect Merchant Ships, While Planning to Prohibit British Ships from Carrying Munitions to Spain</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that the government will introduce a bill in the House to prohibit British ships from carrying munitions to Spain. The British government advocates non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and does not wish to grant the rights of belligerents at sea to either side in the Spanish Civil War at this time. Therefore, if necessary, British warships will protect British ships outside the three-mile territorial waters to prevent interference from any party. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Barcelona The British cruiser Arethusa arrived here last Wednesday from Majorca and has now weighed anchor and returned to its origin. According to sources in London, the ship is now sailing to various ports along the Spanish coast, so its deployment has no special significance. The British destroyer Gallant is still docked in Barcelona, preparing to carry British citizens out of the country. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet decided today to take important naval steps to protect British shipping when the Spanish rebels implement a blockade of ports. It is understood that this plan stipulates that British warships may escort merchant ships when necessary. The Cabinet also decided that neither the Spanish government forces nor the rebels may blockade ports and will notify Spanish rebel leader General Franco and the Spanish government of this decision tomorrow. According to reliable sources, Britain believes that both sides' blockades of ports are illegal because the principles of international law do not recognize either party in a civil war as a belligerent group, and both sides' blockades are merely empty words, as neither has sufficient warships to implement a blockade. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon, attended by Prime Minister Baldwin, Foreign Secretary Eden, Home Secretary Sir John Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare, and Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip. Today was originally a Sunday holiday, but the Cabinet was deeply concerned about the possibility of a major incident in the Mediterranean due to reports that the Spanish Nationalist Army was blockading and bombarding the port of Barcelona. Therefore, a special Cabinet meeting was held to discuss what methods to use to avoid international disputes. It is expected that Foreign Secretary Eden will attend the House of Commons tomorrow to officially announce the decisions made by the Cabinet. Political figures predict that the government may recognize the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to make a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon to explain the Cabinet's current policy on the Spanish Civil War. According to the Daily Mail, "The Foreign Secretary will definitely state that Britain does not intend to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government as a belligerent group, and therefore any actions by that government that attempt to blockade the port of Barcelona will constitute piracy." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of recognizing the two sides in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups, after the French ambassador, Corbin, visited the Foreign Office yesterday to express his opposition, official sources have confirmed that the British government has temporarily abandoned this proposal. Ambassador Corbin also visited the Foreign Office again this morning to discuss the precautionary measures that the British government should take in response to the threat by Spanish Nationalist leader General Franco to blockade the port of Barcelona. Foreign Secretary Eden also summarized the speech he is scheduled to deliver in the House of Commons this afternoon for Ambassador Corbin. In addition, the British government has issued instructions to its merchant ships stationed within Spanish territorial waters, the content of which will be announced by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons.

<h3>Hungarian Regent Goes to Rome, Accompanied by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary Regent Admiral Horthy, accompanied by Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya, took a special train to Rome via Vienna at 3:30 this afternoon. Political figures have officially stated that Horthy's trip shows that while Austria is pro-German, Hungary has pro-Italian tendencies. Although Horthy and most of his cabinet members are Protestants, this trip will also include a visit to the Vatican to express their respect for the Pope's authority. This is Horthy's second foreign trip since becoming regent. The first was in August of this year, when he visited Germany and Austria and met with Chancellor Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Germany. However, political figures believe that Horthy's trip to Germany at that time was unofficial, and his meeting with Hitler was merely a hunting trip, with only one staff member accompanying him. This trip to Rome, however, is an official visit, with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister accompanying him. In addition to being officially hosted by the Italian government, he will also inspect the army in Rome and the navy in the port of Naples, which shows the importance of the visit. In addition, German Foreign Minister Neurath's previous visit to Hungary was also unofficial, while Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano's recent visit here was an official visit. This shows that the relationship between Hungary and Italy is different from the relationship between Hungary and Germany. In this regard, political figures also stated that Italy has twice supported Hungary's claim to revise the treaty, while Germany has only paid lip service and avoided getting involved. In short, the reason why Hungarian Regent Horthy is visiting Rome is that German officials have stated that they cannot support Hungary's claim and have been in contact with Hungary's enemies.

<h3>German Economic Minister Arrives in Iran, Via Turkey</h3>
<p>Tehran, Iran Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, the German Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank, arrived here yesterday from Turkey after visiting Turkey.

The Foreign Minister hosted a banquet that evening to welcome Schacht, inviting key political figures to accompany him. The hosts and guests enjoyed themselves and dispersed. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Funeral of Former French Interior Minister, 500,000 Mourners and Spectators, President Personally Leads Cabinet Members in Bearing the Coffin, Orderly and Without Incident</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today was the day of the funeral for former Interior Minister Salengro. The total number of people gathered along the streets of Lille was no less than 500,000. President Lebrun, all members of the Cabinet, and the speakers of both houses of Parliament personally attended the funeral and bore the coffin. A battalion of infantry also participated in the funeral. Prime Minister Blum, who had the closest friendship with Salengro, gave a speech after the funeral, stating, "Salengro's death was the result of cruel slander. Those who have attacked Salengro's character and honor have made slanderous remarks. The French people will never tolerate the existence of such baseless rumors, which only please Salengro's enemies." Blum's speech was broadcast from Lille to Paris, where a large number of citizens gathered in the Place de la Bastille to listen. The crowd then sang the national anthem and paid tribute to a large portrait of Salengro. It is reported that the people of Bordeaux and Lyon also took similar actions. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Léon Blum went to Lille to attend the funeral of former Interior Minister Salengro and returned to the capital at 9:05 PM. A large crowd welcomed him at the station, many shouting "Long live Léon Blum, long live the Popular Front" to show their sympathy. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the suicide of former Interior Minister Salengro, his vacancy was temporarily filled by Prime Minister Léon Blum. According to well-informed sources, the Council of Ministers will meet tomorrow to appoint State Councilor Tourmol as the new Interior Minister. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Famine Relief and Ceasefire Donations - Teachers and Students in Beiping Rise to Aid Suiyuan -</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in eastern Suiyuan, people here, feeling the tragic bravery of our soldiers fighting on the front lines and their difficult circumstances, and in order to express the support of people in the rear for the loyal and brave soldiers who are determined to defend the territory, there has been a universal call for aid to Suiyuan. Among these calls, various spiritual and material manifestations are numerous. The three matters of fasting, ceasefire, and fundraising are the most moving and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>(1) Fasting: When the fasting movement was first proposed, some people still held doubts, thinking that this was a method used by prisoners to protest against certain treatments by prison officials. One example was seen in the past when Mr. and Mrs. Niu Lan requested to live together and were not allowed. Another example was seen this year when political prisoners in Tianjin Prison demanded an increase in food rations. As for the recent donation of aircraft and funds by prisoners in Xuzhou Prison, as well as the donation of funds to aid Suiyuan by prisoners in Yangzhou Prison, the method of saving money through fasting was also used, because they were imprisoned and had no money to donate, so they had to resort to this method, which should be considered separately. However, most students are well-off and can do their best to contribute, so there is no need to advocate a fasting movement, which would be excessive. The savings are not much, and it is harmful to health. However, the majority opinion is that material donations are certainly necessary, but in order to express the greatest determination, the fasting movement is the most effective. Although the savings of one person are not much, this is a simple and easy thing to do. All citizens can do it. If a trend can be created, out of the 450 million people, except for the soldiers at the front, everyone can fast for one day, and the amount obtained would be astonishing. Moreover, the greatest significance of this movement lies in the spiritual aspect. It can leave a very deep impression on the fasters, give great stimulation to the general public, and give unparalleled encouragement to the soldiers at the front. Therefore, its significance cannot be calculated by the amount of money saved. In the past few days, the latter's opinion has been widely agreed upon by the general public, so the fasting matter has been launched successively in various schools.</p>
<p>Up to now, nearly ten schools have fasted for one day each, and several schools have reduced their food to coarse food (such as corn buns) and remitted the remaining money to the front lines. This includes universities, middle schools, elementary schools, public schools, special vocational schools, and tutoring schools, all of which are available. In terms of age, from 30-year-olds to children around 10 years old, as well as regardless of gender, all participated, which is truly moving. In terms of past examples here, no movement has ever been so widespread. The depth of the Suiyuan war's inspiration can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Most of the students in various schools come from middle-class and above families, and they are usually well-fed and well-clothed. Once they fast, what state will their physiology and psychology be in? This is a highly noteworthy question. The reporter has visited various schools and talked with those who participated in the fasting. In most cases, the first meal of fasting only feels hungry. By the second meal, they feel empty in their stomach and weak all over. By the third meal, their bodies are weak, and bitter water constantly overflows their throats, wanting to vomit but unable to. At this time, if they drink more water or tea, the hunger will be even worse. If they don't drink, their stomachs will be too empty and extremely uncomfortable. In severe cases, they cannot fall asleep at night. According to a ten-year-old girl, when everyone was fasting until the second meal, she was so hungry that she secretly planned to use her saved twenty copper coins to buy snacks to satisfy her hunger, but she finally gritted her teeth and donated the twenty copper coins to the school's Suiyuan Aid Association. The reporter was moved when he heard this, but seeing her innocent and lively state, he could not help but smile bitterly. In terms of psychology, because this is due to patriotic enthusiasm, all participants were extremely excited at the beginning. By the second meal, they entered a state of calmness. By the third meal, a feeling of sadness arose spontaneously. Therefore, when they resume eating the next day, this impression is particularly deep and remains in their minds forever.</p>
<p>The money obtained from fasting and reducing food to coarse food in various schools has reached about a thousand yuan so far, but the spiritual harvest is by no means something that this small amount can represent.</p>
<p>(2) Ceasefire: Once winter arrives here, the normal climate temperature is around 0 degrees Celsius. This year's climate is slightly warmer than in previous years, but ice has already begun to form more than a month ago. Since the beginning of winter (November 6th), the climate has become more severe due to the north wind. On the 16th, it snowed heavily for nearly 12 hours from 1 am, and the accumulated snow on the ground reached several inches at noon when it stopped. All households in the city have already lit their stoves, because without doing so, it would be impossible to resist the cold. Knowing this, the severity of the pressure that the cold adds to the students after they hold a ceasefire movement can be generally seen. According to the usual practice of various schools, fires are started around the beginning of November each year and not extinguished until March of the following year. The fire period lasts about four months, and the daily consumption of coal in various schools, including classrooms, offices, and student dormitories, is quite considerable. This time, when the Suiyuan war broke out, the students were extremely excited. In addition to thinking of all possible ways to provide assistance in terms of material and spirit, they also thought of this kind of ceasefire movement that deprives the body of warmth, in order to save money on coal and remit it to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>After the ceasefire movement was proposed, it was immediately accepted by the students of various schools, who held it separately and obtained the consent of the authorities of each school. The ceasefire period ranged from two weeks to several days. During the period, all offices, classrooms, dormitories, and even dining halls and toilets in the school stopped using stoves. The entire school suddenly turned from a warm place into a cold world. The chimneys standing in the sky, which had been constantly smoking all day since the fires were lit, suddenly stopped, and the scene was extremely desolate. In the washrooms of various schools, the ditches for pouring water often had thin ice.</p>
<p>During the ceasefire period, the spirit shown by the students of various schools was exceptionally good. All regular work such as attending classes, reading books, etc. did not stop. No one was ever seen shrinking back due to the cold. And various activities to aid Suiyuan were intensified, and students from various schools actively participated. Male and female students all went out or stayed on campus to raise donations during the day, and in the evening, they held symposiums on campus or sewed cotton clothes for the soldiers at the front. All of this was carried out at temperatures around freezing, and they did not care about their hands and feet being red and swollen or their mouths and ears cracking. In the lively and enthusiastic atmosphere, there was infinite calmness and seriousness.</p>
<p>After the offices and classrooms stopped using fires, all the faculty and staff of the various schools were affected, but they were all very excited and never complained. The reporter once asked a professor of a certain school who was over seventy years old. At that time, he was sitting on a cold sofa in the faculty lounge, shivering. Seeing this was very pitiful. His ears were hard of hearing, and the reporter asked him several times in a very loud voice before he understood. Who knew that after he understood, he suddenly said sternly, "This is a matter of patriotism. Everyone can endure it, why can't I?" Although his tone was firm when he said this, his old body trembled even more. The reporter respectfully remained silent for a long time. According to statistics, the coal expenses saved by the ceasefire in various schools has reached several thousand yuan. Although the amount is small, it comes from depriving the faculty and students of various schools of their body warmth. This money is used to make cotton clothes, leather clothes, gloves, and other cold-weather items to give to the soldiers fighting in the icy and snowy conditions on the front lines, which also has a special meaning.</p>
<p>(3) Fundraising: Fundraising has been going on sporadically before the outbreak of the Suiyuan war. After the outbreak of the war, it changed from slow to rapid, and from unorganized to organized and planned. As of now, the fundraising methods that have been used include the following: (1) Fundraising from all students, faculty, and staff in the school; (2) Students forming fundraising teams to raise donations from pedestrians, shops, and households on the streets; (3) All faculty and staff initiating and donating one day's salary; (4) Female student groups organizing variety shows to donate the proceeds from ticket sales to the front lines. In addition, there are various fundraising methods under consideration, but they have not yet been adopted. Among the above methods, the third method is the most effective and has the largest amount of money. Each national university donates more than a thousand yuan per day. The second method is the next most effective. Wherever student fundraising teams go, most people enthusiastically contribute. As for those who truly do not give a penny, they are the minority of the minority. According to the results of the past few days, intellectuals are the most generous, followed by workers, then households, then merchants, and finally, small officials are the most stingy.</p>
<p>In short, in order to help the soldiers fighting at the front, the teachers and students of various schools here are doing their best to find ways to raise more funds. Although the local authorities here had a proposal to prohibit students from fundraising on the streets a few days ago, after the authorities of various schools contacted the local authorities and reached an agreement, remedies have been made for the various malpractices that the local authorities were worried about. Under the compliance with these various methods, the full-scale fundraising of students throughout the city will be launched on the 22nd. ... (5) Handling registration of rice merchants; (6) Investigating customs import and export certificates. C. The Second District Commissioner's Office may add personnel to handle the management and investigation of food affairs. The required expenses shall be drawn from the general reserve fund, with a temporary limit of 2,000 yuan, and the special office shall prepare a budget for review. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Revises Regulations on Rice Export; Northern Anhui to Implement Warehouse System; Central and Southern Anhui to Centralize Visa Issuance and Release at Wuhu</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province exported a total of 4 to 5 million shi of rice this year, a huge amount that exceeds the records of the previous five years. Recently, in order to promote sales to Guangdong Province as much as possible to restore the original market, the provincial authorities have repeatedly contacted the Guangdong Provincial Government by letter and telegram to discuss the exchange of Anhui rice for Guangdong sugar. Now Guangdong has sent Yan Zefang to Wuhu to investigate the production and sales of Anhui rice. Yan stayed here for two days and held several talks with representatives of the rice industry. He left by boat on the 22nd for Anqing to discuss implementation methods with the provincial government. However, after the provincial government issued a ban, all counties have acted vigorously. Hexian Yuxi Town, the general port for sailing transport, has successively detained hundreds of rice boats, and rice merchants have risen up to fight for release, but have not yet been allowed. However, the Wuhu sea route is still reporting exports as usual. The Fuhe and other rice shops recently handled more than 100,000 shi of rice to North China, which have all been loaded. There are still a large number of iron boats stopped on the surface of the water, busily loading. Since the customs has not received a notice from the Inspector General of Customs to ban transportation, it is still released as usual. Recently, it was heard that Min Cai and Jian Er Ying jointly proposed to the provincial government to revise the regulations on banning rice exports. The main points are: In northern Anhui, implement a warehouse system to handle storage and mortgages; in central and southern Anhui, concentrate on Wuhu to restrict exports, and issue visas by the commissioner of the second district for release. The plan has been resolved and approved by the provincial government committee meeting and is divided into three points: A. All areas in northern Anhui shall prohibit the export of grain at any time. In the future, the agricultural warehouse management office and the local banks in this province shall be ordered to promote the warehouse system as much as possible and handle storage and mortgages. Unless there are special circumstances, they shall not be forfeited. B. Regarding the food in central and southern Anhui, a restrictive principle shall be adopted. Gao Wenbo, commissioner of the second district, shall be responsible for handling it according to the following methods: (1) The commissioner Gao shall sign and release the food imported and exported in Wuhu; (2) Food merchants shall submit an application form for exporting rice. The application form shall be determined by the special office and reported to the government for filing; (3) According to customs statistics, a daily output quota table shall be prepared. If the quota is exceeded, appropriate restrictions shall be imposed; (4) On one hand, personnel shall be sent to the grain distribution points to investigate the need for rice and whether there are sales of rice. On the other hand, merchants shall be ordered to fill out an application form stating that the rice is for domestic sales only, and promising to be subject to legal sanctions if they violate the regulations.</p>
<h3>Important Gold Mine Discovered in Fuzhou; Geological Survey Exploration Results; Extremely Rich Gold Mine Deposits Everywhere</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi's mineral resources are extremely rich, such as tungsten in southern Jiangxi and coal in Pingxiang, which are famous in the world. It is learned that the Provincial Geological Survey has specially organized exploration teams to explore the mineral resources of the entire province separately. They have successively discovered many valuable mineral resources such as manganese, iron, and barite. According to a report from Zhou Daolong of the Linchuan Exploration Team in Fuzhou, several quartz vein outcrops were found on small hills in the Mopan Mountain Gan Jia Ling area of ​​the Yisu District, 40 miles northeast of the county seat. After breaking them open and examining them, they contained gold particles. At the moment, they explored the veins everywhere. From the road from the Hu family at the foot of the mountain to the Dagan market, they found more than 20 gold ore veins within four or five miles vertically and horizontally. They generally trended north at 20 degrees east, running parallel to each other with very steep dips. The wider ones were about one meter wide, and the narrower ones were several centimeters wide. The extension reached more than 500 meters. Gold can be seen with the naked eye in the outcrops, and its richness can be imagined. However, it contains a small amount of impurities such as pyrite and limonite. Samples have been obtained and transported to the province for analysis. The exploration team crossed the Ru River east from there to Yunshan Station, and heard that there were gold diggers near the station, so they expected that there must still be natural gold-producing areas upstream. The scope of gold production in Linchuan must be broad, and there will definitely be more important discoveries in the future.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Yue Temple Digging Artesian Well</h3>
<p>The residents of the wooden county town relied on drawing water from the city river for drinking, but the river water was turbid and unclean, which hindered sanitation. County Magistrate Li discussed and approved that various banks and money shops in the financial sector would advance funds, and first dig a well in the Yue Temple outside the city, and use the proceeds from selling water in the future to repay the advance funds. After several meetings, it was generally determined that the Shanghai Tianyuan Well Drilling Company would contract for it at a price of more than 2,000 yuan and was expected to be completed in 45 days. Yesterday, County Magistrate Li broke ground in front of the Ten Kings Hall in the Yue Temple on the west side and immediately started construction.</p>

<h3>Widow Dies from Abortion</h3>
<p>Chen Shi, a widow in the fourth district of Yifu Township, has assets and was recently seduced by Zhou Pinru, a villager, and became pregnant. In order to avoid attention, Zhou sent someone to abort Chen, but the surgery was improper, resulting in her death. Chen's aunt filed a complaint with the county government, requesting redress. The dispatched law enforcement police went to the countryside in disguise and arrested the principal offender Zhou Pinru and the person involved, Gu Laotai, and sent them to the county jail. Later, Gu was allowed to be released on bail. Chen's body will be transported to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for examination in the near future, and then interrogated.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Murder Case in Muduo</h3>
<p>The Procuratorate of the Wuxian District Court reported that Zhang Changxiang, the local security chief of Jinshan Township, Muduo, reported that Liu Hesheng, a stonemason in the township, went out to work on the 21st and did not return until late. On the 22nd, his wife went out to look for him and found a pile of blood and a shoe near Chahubang. The shoe was indeed her husband's shoe, so she was shocked. Later, her husband's body was found in the river, with his hands tied behind his back, a huge stone hanging from his waist, and multiple knife wounds on his head and other places. It was believed that he had been killed and thrown into the river after being murdered by someone he had a grudge against. A request was made to send someone to examine the body. The local procuratorate sent prosecutor He to the township on the 23rd to examine the body, and the public security fifth sub-bureau in charge paid close attention to the case, investigated the case quietly, and arrested the murderer to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale New Movement Exercise</h3>

<h3>Wuxi Expand Suiyuan Aid Movement</h3>
<p>In order to initiate the consolation of the soldiers fighting in Suiyuan, the county chamber of commerce of this county convened a meeting of representatives from various institutions, organizations, and schools yesterday to discuss expanding the Suiyuan aid movement.

Also, Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company donated more than 100 yuan, the brewing industry 100 yuan, and the Zhejiang Salt General Stack 123 yuan, all to console the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Lack of Silkworm Eggs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>In recent months, overseas silk markets have soared, and domestic silk merchants have all made profits of more than double. The future of the silk industry has embarked on a prosperous path. The silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are more interested in raising silkworms next spring than before. Therefore, the sales of silkworm eggs next spring will also be very smooth and there is already a trend of supply exceeding demand. According to Lu Zirong, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Association, the spring seeds next year will be in great shortage. The silkworm eggs produced by the breeding fields in Jiangsu Province can only export 300,000 sheets, in addition to supplying the needs of the province. At present, 800,000 sheets of silkworm eggs have been imported from Zhejiang Province into Jiangsu Province. Therefore, according to the needs of silkworm farmers, Jiangsu Province will be short of 500,000 sheets of spring seeds. The situation of seed shortage in Zhejiang Province is even more severe than that in Jiangsu Province, with a shortage of 1 million sheets. Combining the two provinces, there is a total shortage of 1.5 million sheets.</p>
<h3>Nantong Search and Suppress Bandits in Reclamation Area</h3>

Wu Ying, the captain of the second brigade of the Industrial Police, is leading a team to search and suppress them and has arrested the main criminals and handed them over to the district security headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>New Channel for Yangtze River Passenger Ships</h3>
<p>Because the Qingtian Reef channel in the Tongzhou River surface is only ten feet deep, the Yangtze River passenger ships will temporarily stop calling in order to avoid danger. Traffic between the counties under the jurisdiction of Tongzhou and the ports on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been cut off, which is quite inconvenient. After surveying by the customs, a new channel has been discovered. It has already been located in the Yao port of the river and new black buoys have been set up. The Yangtze River passenger ships going up and down the river have been regularly berthed in Tong since the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Change of Public Security Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Song Mingqi, the director of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau, was transferred with He Runzhang, the director of the Songjiang Bureau. He arrived in Tong on the 21st to take over the post and announced that Yang Deji and others were section chiefs.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Telegrams Province to Close Canals Along the Canal</h3>

After the dam is built, it will be opened again. A telegram was sent to the provincial government to transfer it to the Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau to inform the relevant counties to assist. It is heard that the local county government has received the notification and ordered the relevant district bureaus to comply.</p>
<h3>Bar Association Re-election Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>The fourth session of the autumn regular general meeting of the Jiangdu Lawyers Association, the election meeting, was held at 3:00 pm on the 22nd at the association in Quekou Street. After resolving various cases, a member, Fang Ren, made a temporary motion, based on the provisions of Article 12 of the constitution, that the president and vice president can only serve one term, and whether the problem of wheel-style mutual appointment can be discussed at the conference. The atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense, and members successively expressed their opinions and debated fiercely, each expressing their reasons. No solution has been found. Then the mountain supervisor and supervisor withdrew from the meeting to discuss a solution. An opinion was expressed on this issue and it was proposed to submit it to the provincial party headquarters for submission to the central government and to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for interpretation. The election would be held after the interpretation, so as to avoid the election being invalid. Therefore, the meeting on the 22nd was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Fever of Salary Donation to Aid Suiyuan</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Party Headquarters convened representatives from various institutions, organizations, and schools in the county at 2 pm on the 23rd to discuss the establishment of a National Contribution One-Day Income Movement Promotion Committee to facilitate the aid to Suiyuan. It was learned that all institutions, in addition to the county government staff and police who had donated one day's salary, and ordered the district offices to comply, Shu Guohua of the Construction Bureau also transferred 32 yuan and 2 jiao from one day's salary of all employees to the county for forwarding. Other bureaus and institutes were all donating and concentrating.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Flour Mill Preparing to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Yuheng Flour Mill outside the north gate of the county is the largest enterprise in the county. It was founded in the early years of the Republic of China and has a very good business. The prosperity of the city depends on it. No less than two or three thousand people directly and indirectly depend on it for their livelihood. Unfortunately, since the levee was breached in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the mill was right in the path of the breach. Although the mill building was not washed away, the internal machinery and wheat flour were severely damaged. As a result, it has been closed for more than five years. During this period, there have been several attempts by people from Yangzhen to take over the factory, but they ultimately failed to reach an agreement due to improper conditions. It is now heard that the factory has been formally leased by Yicheng Flour Company in Zhenjiang and has hired workers to repair the houses and reorganize the machinery. It is expected that business can be resumed after the beginning of the year.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan All Sectors Console Suiyuan Soldiers</h3>
<p>On the 21st, all sectors of Xiaoshan held a general assembly of all sectors to assist the Suiyuan guards and soldiers at the county party headquarters. Representatives from the gentry, business, school, and agencies participated unanimously. In addition to passing the fundraising to comfort, they also passed the letters and telegrams comforting the soldiers at the front, and the frugality of food donations to the government.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I recently read a news message on the eighth edition of the second sheet of your newspaper on November 17 of this year about the dismantling of the traitorous organization in Mingguang. Because the wife of Chen Juzheng, a gardener outside the county seat, often sells vegetables outside the store, it was mentioned that her husband had recently gone out and entrusted her to forward a family letter on his behalf, for a very short time. However, whether Chen is a traitor is unknown. It was not known until it was revealed. The First District Office inquired about the truth by order of the county government, but there was no arrest. Later, he was ordered to return. The statement of an organization for mutual communication of news is thought to be due to a distant rumor. I request that you make a correction. I respectfully ask for your peace.</p>

<p>Employees of Two Railways</p>
<p>Incensed by the bandit invasion of Suiyuan, the colleagues of the Jinghu, Huhang, and Yong railways jointly convened a meeting led by the Party (Special Party Branch), government, and labor union leaders. They decided that all employees, regardless of their position, would voluntarily donate their salaries to comfort the soldiers at the front lines. The first batch of 10,000 yuan, representing half a day's salary for all employees, was handed over to the Shanghai Bank of China on the 18th to be remitted to Pacification Director Yan of Taiyuan, who would then transfer it to Chairman Fu Zuoyi.

Fortunately, you uphold your duty to defend the territory, repeatedly thwarting the bandits' attacks. Your loyalty, integrity, courage, and righteousness shine throughout history.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Remains in Shanghai, Did Not Go to the Capital Last Night</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice-President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, has been recovering well and has been back on duty since he resumed his duties last Monday. He has been going to the Central Bank to work as usual every day. It is reported that Kong remains in Shanghai because he has not fully recovered from his heart disease and is wary of traveling, and because he has not yet completed his official duties in Shanghai. He did not return to the capital last night.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Income Tax from the Banking and Money Industries are Printed and Distributed to Various Committees for Study, A Second Joint Meeting Will Be Held</h3>
<p>After the joint meeting of the Income Tax Subcommittee of the Banking Association and the Income Tax Research Committee of the Money Industry Association on the 21st, the opinions on income tax submitted by the banking and money industry associations, member banks, money shops, and banking societies in various places have been classified and compiled. Yesterday, they were compiled by Gu Chengan, secretary of the Banking Association, and it was decided that the compiled opinions would be printed and distributed to the various committee members for study immediately. Then, Cai Chengxin of the Bank of China will convene a second joint meeting on a scheduled date. After passing the opinions, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance to offer suggestions, hoping that they will be adopted.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Prominent Figures</h3>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao, Zhu Jiahua, and Zou Lin took the night express train to the capital last night.</p>
<p>Wang Maogong took the night train out of the capital last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Sun Weidong Will Go to the Capital</h3>
<p>Sun Weidong, Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, representing Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Jicha Political Affairs Committee, came south to present the requirements of Duan Qirui. After arriving in Shanghai on the 14th, he visited various parties in Shanghai in the following days and elaborated on the current situation in North China. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, he visited Central Committee member Wang Chonghui at his private residence on Route Massenet, talking for more than an hour before leaving. It is also learned that Sun had previously met with Finance Minister Kong to discuss the issue of anti-smuggling in North China. He is scheduled to go to the capital within a few days to pay respects to Foreign Minister Zhang and other authorities to discuss everything before returning north to report.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Suiyuan and Foreign Affairs, Considers Whether to Suspend Diplomatic Negotiations, and Whether the Suiyuan Incident Can Be Appealed to the League of Nations According to the Covenant</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, former judge of the International Court of Justice, returned north to Shanghai earlier this month after representing the central government at the state funeral of the late President Huk of Mecca in Guangdong. He is still staying in Shanghai. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, visited him the day before yesterday to exchange views on national affairs. Yesterday morning, Wang met with reporters from the 新声社 (New Voice Society) at his residence and made the following remarks on national affairs:</p>
<p>Not an Inch of Territory Can Be Ceded Again</p>
<p>In answering questions from reporters, Wang first mentioned the invasion of Suiyuan by the bandits and puppet troops, saying that the lost territory has not yet been recovered, and now there is another invasion by the bandits and puppets. Where is the background? The world knows. At this moment, we must not retreat again, and not an inch of territory can be lost. Reports say that troops from a certain country are moving from Rehe towards Chahar and Suiyuan. Although the Japanese authorities still repeatedly deny participating in the Suiyuan incident, it must be known that participation is one thing, and the Japanese side will never publicly admit it. Otherwise, it would be tantamount to declaring war.</p>
<p>Stop Negotiations Immediately</p>
<p>Continuing, he talked about the Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. Now that the Suiyuan incident has occurred, should we formally announce the suspension of negotiations immediately? This depends on how far Foreign Minister Zhang and the Japanese Ambassador have negotiated in the past. Because I do not know the content, I am not in a position to arbitrarily advocate for it. When President Sun came to visit yesterday, he also mentioned it, but he did not know the details because he had been away from the capital for a long time. Our views on the Suiyuan incident and foreign affairs cannot be recommended to the government until after a thorough study.</p>
<p>Can Appeal to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Then the reporter asked whether, since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the Suiyuan incident can still be appealed to the League of Nations. Wang replied that according to Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant, it is still possible to submit it to the League of Nations. However, since the League of Nations failed to handle the September 18th Incident, and recently failed to handle the Italy-Abyssinia dispute effectively, the League of Nations itself has lost its prestige and has no power at all. Therefore, whether there will be any results if the Suiyuan incident is submitted is still a question. But the League of Nations is now engaged in amending the Covenant, trying to extricate itself, and hoping to restore its former prestige.</p>
<p>Observe the German-Japanese Alliance</p>
<p>The reporter further asked about his observations on the German-Japanese alliance. According to him, both Germany and Japan are still denying this matter, and it is not yet known what the content is. According to my observation, if there is such a thing, its content must be complicated and not just an alliance. Japan is simply trying to use the situation in Europe to contain the Far East. Wang said at the end that he would go to the capital when necessary, but he has no such preparation at the moment. His nasal disease has improved significantly and he is temporarily stopping treatment for two weeks before taking another X-ray to see if it is completely cured.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest in Japanese Cotton Mills, Party and Government Agencies Mediate All Night, As a Result, the Kiwa Three Factories and One or Two Places in the Toyoda Factory Are Scheduled to Resume Work One After Another Today and Tomorrow, Both Internal and External Factories Petition the Social Affairs Bureau, Labor Unrest Occurred Again Yesterday in the Nichihua Third and Fourth Factories</h3>
<p>According to the 大公社 (Da Gong News Agency), after the Party and government agencies mediated the labor unrest in the Kiwa Three Factories in West Shanghai, eight settlement conditions were signed. All workers are scheduled to resume work this morning, and the Toyoda Factory is scheduled to start work tomorrow morning. The labor side issued a resumption of work declaration. Representatives from various internal and external cotton factories petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. A strike occurred again yesterday afternoon at the Nichihua Cotton Mill. The Japanese spinning industry sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the labor unrest. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>幕和 (Kiwa) Cotton Mill</p>
<p>All the workers of the Japanese-owned Kiwa First, Second, and Third Factories on Route Robert sought to increase wages and proposed seven conditions to improve their treatment. The factory refused to accept, leading to a strike. They also fired six people, including the meal contractor Wang Han. Yesterday morning, the workers supported their representatives and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the factory be notified to settle their wages and leave the factory to return to their hometowns, unwilling to work in the factory again. Therefore, the labor unrest intensified. In order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the Third Department, together with Wu Wenbang, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Tan Baoshou, director of the Caojiadu Branch of the Public Security Bureau, to the factory to negotiate. After Director Wang earnestly persuaded both labor and management from the government's standpoint, eight settlement conditions were finally signed at 7:30 PM, declaring a resolution.</p>
<p>Signed Conditions</p>
<p>(1) All workers will receive a 5% wage increase starting from the first half of November. (2) Day and night shift workers will each have 30 minutes of rest during meal times. (3) Night workers on Saturdays must not have their work extended. For extended working hours, wages will be increased according to factory regulations. (4) When hiring workers, workers recruited in the workshop should be given priority. If there are no suitable people in the workshop, the factory may recruit others. (5) The labor side requests that compensation and allowances be paid monthly. Both sides will follow the method decided by the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China to ensure uniformity. (6) The six cooks, including Chen Guoyu, Wang Han, Li Baoquan, Sun Dequan, Zhou Daosheng, and Yu Shoufan, will still be allowed to reside in the workshop. (7) The factory must not dismiss workers or expel cooks from the workshop without reason. (8) The labor side will resume work uniformly at 6:00 AM on the 24th of this month (today). Capital representatives were 梠久治 (Taro Kuju), labor representatives were He Hanru, Zhou Daosheng, and nine others, Social Affairs Bureau representative was Wang Xianqing, Municipal Party Department representative was Wu Wenbang, and Public Security Bureau Caojiadu Branch Director was 译葆 (Bao Yi).</p>
<p>Internal and External Cotton Mills</p>
<p>After the labor unrest occurred in the Japanese-owned Internal and External Cotton Mills No. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, the workers put forward seven conditions (the contents of the conditions are the same as those of other factories) and demanded that the factory accept them, but they were rejected and the issue remained unresolved. Yesterday morning at 9:15, more than ten workers from the factory went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the Third Department, met with them and, after inquiring about the situation, promised to negotiate with the factory. A second batch of more than 20 worker representatives then petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:30, and Wang Xianqing again met with them and promised to contact the factory about the workers' demands. They dispersed at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Situation of Various Factories</p>
<p>The Internal and External Cotton Mills No. 1 and No. 2 on Robert Road have a total of more than 1,400 workers. More than 100 day shift workers entered the factory to work yesterday morning, and 550 night shift workers entered the factory to work. Mills No. 5, 6, 7, and 3 on West Suzhou Road have a total of more than 3,600 workers. About 300 day shift workers entered the factory to work yesterday morning, and 600 night shift workers entered the factory to work. Mill No. 8 on Gordon Road has a total of more than 1,600 workers. More than 210 day shift workers entered the factory to work yesterday morning, and 400 night shift workers entered the factory to work. Mill No. 9 on Mackinnon Road has a total of more than 1,200 workers. About 150 day shift workers entered the factory to work yesterday morning, and 320 night shift workers entered the factory to work.</p>
<p>Nichihua Factories</p>
<p>The Nichihua Third and Fourth Cotton Mills at No. 500 Robert Road in West Shanghai employ a total of 2,051 male and female workers. Fortunately, the factory was not involved in the strike that occurred in various Japanese cotton mills in West Shanghai this time. However, at 3:15 PM yesterday, when 1,050 day shift workers were working, two female workers in the winding room were repairing their machines, which were damaged. A Japanese supervisor saw this and suspected that the two female workers were closing the machines to instigate a strike. He immediately telephoned the Xiaoshadu Road police station, which immediately sent four Western detectives and 50 Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the factory and drive all the workers out of the factory, thus causing a labor unrest. The night shift workers also expressed dissatisfaction because of the arbitrary oppression by the factory and did not enter the factory to work.</p>
<p>Toyoda Cotton Mill</p>
<p>After more than 4,500 male and female workers in the Toyoda First and Second Factories at Zhongshan Road Bridge went on a joint strike on the 17th of this month, the unrest was extremely serious. Du Yuesheng, President of the Local Association of this city, concerned that the dispute was persistent and that both labor and management suffered losses, and also affected social security, specially accompanied Qian Xinzhi, a leader in the banking industry, to mediate. After repeatedly visiting Tatsichiro Funatsu, President of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, and the heads of the factories to discuss the matter, six conditions were decided. At the same time, they also advised the worker representatives and finally reached a resolution. All workers are scheduled to enter the factory on Wednesday (tomorrow) to resume work. At the same time, the factory will also reorganize the internal machinery of the factory and decide to start work as scheduled.</p>
<p>Resolved Conditions</p>
<p>(1) Release the arrested workers. (2) Increase wages by 9% (those with too low wages in normal times will be increased appropriately according to the above example). (3) Monthly party wages will be changed to a monthly incentive system. (4) For working 12 hours on Sundays, if the workload is busy and exceeds 12 hours, the wages will be increased according to the earned wages, and a night porridge will be provided. Those who do not work will be allowed to rest. (5) Workers must not be dismissed without cause. (6) All striking workers will resume work.</p>
<p>General News</p>
<p>After the labor unrest occurred successively in the Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai, the Japanese government and public opinion paid close attention. Now Toyoda Risaburo, President of Toyoda, and Shigeru Oshima and other senior members of the Japanese spinning industry have arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai No. 9 to investigate the truth of the strikes in various factories and to inspect the damage to the Toyoda Second Factory. They also attended the meeting of the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China held yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions, and expressed their gratitude to Du for his mediation.</p>

<h3>Huang Fu's Condition Worsens; Urinary Retention, Abdominal Distension, and Sharp Decline in Appetite; Doctors Currently Performing Bowel Movement and Other Procedures</h3>
<p>State Councilor Huang Fu has been receiving treatment for stomach problems at the Hong En Hospital. After undergoing surgery by Western doctors and treatment by Fan Shisheng, he switched to traditional Chinese medicine. His condition had gradually improved, and dangerous signs had decreased. However, due to his advanced age and weakened blood, he required a long period of recuperation. According to a Xinxin News Agency reporter, in addition to continuing treatment by Fan Shisheng, Western doctors were also examining Huang's condition from time to time, hoping to combine Western and traditional Chinese medicine for a speedy recovery. Unexpectedly, in recent days, he suddenly suffered from urinary retention. Despite several attempts to induce bowel movements, no results were seen, leading to abdominal distension and a sharp decline in appetite. The surgically opened abdomen showed cracks due to the distension. Therefore, doctors are currently performing corrective surgery and researching methods to induce bowel movements, hoping that his improving condition will not take another turn for the worse.</p>

<h3>Income Tax Rate: Promulgated Based on Economic Conditions. The "Da Mei Wan Bao" Commentary Contains Much Misunderstanding. The "Continental Daily News" Has Already Published Articles Refuting It. The Income Tax Affairs Office Does Not Attach Importance to It.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance is levying income tax. Because it is a new undertaking, it is being implemented gradually. The regulations are being formulated in detail, and opinions are being collected from all parties. Recently, the "Da Mei Wan Bao" published an editorial criticizing the tax regulations promulgated by the Ministry and comparing them with the situation in the United States. There are many discrepancies with the actual situation. The English-language "Continental Daily News" then wrote an article to refute it. A reporter yesterday specifically inquired with the Income Tax Affairs Office and received a detailed explanation. The key points of the two newspapers and their discussions are recorded below.</p>
<p>English "Da Mei Evening News" Editorial</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, the English "Da Mei Wan Bao" published an editorial criticizing the newly implemented Chinese income tax system. It also used charts to compare the tax systems of the United States and the Philippines in detail. Summarizing the details, there are approximately five points: 1. Under the Chinese income tax system, interest income, regardless of size, is taxed at a rate of 5%. However, the tax rate on salary income is higher than that on interest income (for example, salary income above 700 is taxed at a rate exceeding 5%). 2. The tax rate on middle and lower salary income increases too quickly, while higher salary income is treated preferentially. 3. Regardless of the taxpayer's family burden, the tax-free amount is uniformly set at 30 yuan. 4. Lower-level workers with a monthly salary of more than 30 yuan, such as servants, mechanics, chauffeurs, clerks, shop assistants, etc., are not exempt from tax. 5. The monthly micro-collection costs of Chinese income tax are enormous, and it is feared that income will not cover expenses.</p>
<p>Refutation by the English-language "Continental Daily News"</p>
<p>Recently, the English-language "Continental Daily News" published an article by Li Wu, severely refuting the points raised by the "Da Mei Wan Bao." The key points are as follows: 1. The economic situations of China and the United States are very different, and the living standards of the two countries are also different. Very few individuals in China have a monthly salary income exceeding 1,500 yuan. The "Da Mei Wan Bao"'s so-called middle and lower salary income almost includes all levels of salary income in the country. The increase rate with the rise of income is slightly the same, so the statement that the highest salary income is treated preferentially is completely unfounded. 2. The lowest individual monthly salary income in China is far less than that in the United States. The starting point for salary income tax in the United States is 1,000 yuan in Chinese currency per month. Individuals in China with a monthly salary income below 1,000 yuan account for more than 95%. If the standard for salary income must be the same as in the United States, then it will be impossible to implement salary income tax in China. 3. Lower-level workers in China, such as servants and mechanics, rarely have a monthly salary income exceeding the tax-free amount (30 yuan). Therefore, in reality, these people are all exempt from tax. 4. China adopts a withholding system. Although it is collected monthly, all expenses are extremely limited. 5. Very few individuals in China have a monthly salary income exceeding 700 yuan, and it can be said that there are extremely few exceeding 1,500 yuan. Therefore, the actual highest tax rate on salary income is no more than 5%. The "Da Mei Wan Bao"'s assertion that China's income tax treats interest income and salary income unequally is not a problem.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Income Tax Affairs Office</p>
<p>The reporter believes that both sides of the debate are related to academics, so he visited someone from the Income Tax Affairs Office about this matter. According to him, the reports from both newspapers have been given deep attention. From his personal opinion, the economic level of China is very different from that of the United States and the Philippines. The "Da Mei Wan Bao" did not investigate this point in detail, which is due to a lack of understanding of the Chinese situation. China's family system and property system are different from those in the West. It is impossible to use the situation in Shanghai or other cities as an example for the whole country. For example, children having no private property is an old Chinese etiquette. Even today, large families and those who live together in clans still adhere to this virtue. Therefore, able-bodied men in the eyes of Europeans and Americans are independent, and their elderly parents are dependent, but in the eyes of old Chinese etiquette, these able-bodied men are dependent, and their economic independence is still in the hands of their parents. This is all clear evidence. As for labor income, the rate should be lower than capital income, although this is an indisputable theory. However, China has concessions and foreign banks, and whether the interest income of foreign banks can be taxed uniformly has not been resolved. If China legislates to adopt a progressive system for interest income, it would be tantamount to encouraging Chinese capital to flee, and foreign banks would take advantage of this opportunity to absorb capital. (For example, the ordinary interest rate for deposits in Chinese banks is 4%, while the ordinary interest rate for deposits in foreign banks is 3%. If the Chinese interest income tax exceeds 1%, Chinese capital will inevitably be at risk of fleeing.) China currently only extracts three types of income from various incomes to levy income tax. Since the taxable object is not all of the income, the deduction of personal living expenses and the tax exemption for those who depend on others cannot completely follow the example of Europe and the United States. In short, income tax is an extremely complex and scientific tax rule. In terms of the progress of income tax history in various countries, it has not been achieved overnight. The current Chinese tax system is similar to the British classified income tax system and will need to be gradually improved in the future. Although the arguments of foreign scholars are worthy of reference, they are ultimately not worth emphasizing.</p>
<h3>Huining Guild Hall: Election Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Huining Guild Hall held an election meeting yesterday.

<h3>China Farmers Bank: Purchases Aircraft Alone to Celebrate Birthday. The Bank Has Already Paid the Entire Amount to the Central Bank. In the Future, It Will Form a Team with the Other Five Aircraft.</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank, in order to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, purchased a bomber aircraft alone and presented it to the government. The value is 130,000 US dollars, equivalent to 438,184 yuan in national currency, plus freight and donation fees of 1,100 yuan, for a total of 439,294 yuan. The bank has already paid the entire amount to the Central Bank yesterday. Together with the aircraft purchased by the Central Bank, one aircraft purchased by the Bank of China, one aircraft purchased by the Bank of Communications, one aircraft purchased by the Construction Bank Corporation and the Guohuo Bank, and one aircraft purchased by the Shanghai Banking Association, a total of 2.5 million yuan, will form a team. The Central Bank has ordered them from the United States, and they will be the latest model of bomber aircraft. The order has been placed for a long time and can be shipped to China immediately.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Propaganda Extended to the End of the Year: Municipal Public Security Bureau Complies with Orders</h3>
<p>Since the anti-drug propaganda in this city began on the 10th of this month, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, and other agencies have separately organized propaganda teams to carry out the propaganda. In the past ten days, more than a thousand people have voluntarily requested to quit smoking. However, the number of beds in the original anti-smoking hospitals in this city is insufficient, so the Municipal Health Bureau is trying to add 100 beds in a short period of time. The Garrison Command has also instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau to extend the anti-drug propaganda to the end of this year so that smokers in the city who have not registered have the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and avoid military punishment. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau is now complying with the order to continue the propaganda so that all those who have not been legally registered by the end of this year will voluntarily quit smoking at the anti-smoking hospitals in this city.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Pudong Yesterday Morning: Five Houses Destroyed, Telephone Lines Cut Off, Girl Lin Bao Tragically Burned to Death, Corpse Like Charred Coal.</h3>
<p>At 1:55 AM yesterday morning, a sudden fire broke out between Zhang Yongxing's cake shop, numbered 200 on Dongchang Road, Dongchang Lane, Pudong, and the adjacent 202, Wu Longtai. At that time, there were few pedestrians on the road. By the time it was discovered, it had become a prairie fire. After the flames burst out of the storefront, they became even more rampant. The telephone pole opposite was also scorched and caught fire, instantly cutting off the main line connecting Pudong and Puxi, resulting in a temporary situation.</p>
<p>Quite Critical</p>
<p>The Pudong District Fire Brigade nearby immediately drove to the scene to rescue. However, there was no water source there, so they connected 30 five-zhang-long hoses to the Huangpu River, which took a lot of trouble to draw water for firefighting. At that time, the north wind was urgent, and the fire was fueled by the wind, and its momentum became even greater. The raging flames soared into the sky, causing nearby residents to be panic-stricken. For a time, moving furniture and objects filled the road, causing the order.</p>
<p>Quite Chaotic</p>
<p>The police and corps organs dispatched troops to the scene to suppress the situation, persuading onlookers to retreat to a corner so that firefighters could calmly carry out rescue operations. After an hour of burning, all five of the buildings in that block of city buildings were completely destroyed and spread to the houses in the first lane of Houshu Lane. Firefighters urgently changed their plan and requested that the water patrol team of the dragon head be sent to the police station, circling to the lane, and the houses in the second lane were.</p>
<p>Desperately Saved</p>
<p>After another hour, five houses in the first lane were also burned down one after another, and the fire gradually weakened. At that time, the fire brigade inspector Wang Zhenya was carrying the dragon head hose and was about to go to the depths of the fire in the lane to water. When he walked to the door of the destroyed No. 9, the wall suddenly collapsed, and Wang was unable to avoid it, and his body was crushed by the wall bricks.</p>
<p>Injured</p>
<p>Fortunately, all the firefighters immediately tried to rescue him, and his left hand had been seriously injured and it was difficult to bend it. He was urgently sent to Dr. Wang Xiongfei for treatment. Because the injury was not serious, he could still walk after bandaging. The fire lasted for about two hours, and a total of ten buildings were destroyed, including Wu Longtai's clothing store at No. 202, Zhang Yongxing's cake shop at No. 200, Shi Deji's buying and selling shop at No. 198, No. 196.</p>
<p>Jiang Jingshan and others' five buildings, and Gao Yuqing at No. 5, Lin Genda at No. 6, Tang Duanfang at No. 7, Li Ronghua at No. 8, and Shengneng Art Institute at No. 9 in Dongchang Lane, a total of ten buildings. The victims included more than 20 households, including two landlords and three tenants. The loss of houses and property was about 30,000 yuan. Also, Zhang Xichun, the owner of Zhang Yongxing's cake shop.</p>
<p>His adopted daughter, Lin Bao, was only twelve years old. When the fire broke out, she was sound asleep and could not escape, and was tragically burned to death. Until 2 PM yesterday afternoon, after the embers of the fire were completely extinguished, the girl's body was found after opening the rubble. It was charred like charcoal and unbearable to look at. The Pudong Branch then summoned Lu Shunlong, the map reporter of the area, to report to the court for inspection this morning. As for the Pudong Telephone Bureau, it also repaired the Pudong West.</p>
<p>The main line of communication was restored at noon yesterday. There are various rumors about the cause of the fire. Afterwards, according to Wu Liansheng, the local owner of the clothing store, who surrendered to the Pudong Branch, he claimed that the cake shop next door would start a fire to steam cakes at about 1 AM every day. The stove was close to the wall, and there was a lot of rice straw piled up on the mezzanine floor of his shop, so it was suspected that the fire was caused by the heat. The director considered it necessary to investigate and ordered it to be sent to the main bureau for disposition. It is heard that all the victims, except for the residents in the lane, have fire insurance.</p>
<h3>Henan Road and Fuzhou Road to be Modified with Automatic Traffic Lights, and a Circular Lawn Will Be Opened, Gradually Promoting to Other Places</h3>
<p>The traffic lights at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession have been changed to automatic type since yesterday. There is no need for police officers to host, and the light color changes from green to yellow, and from yellow to red, and the transition is free, which is very convenient for traffic command and vehicle scheduling. According to the Municipal Bureau of Works, the Bureau will soon use the automatic signal lights at the intersection of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road. The area around the traffic lights will also be opened up with a circular lawn. Vehicles will drive along the lawn. This kind of road traffic equipment is installed in various countries in Europe and America, wherever traffic is heavy, so it will be gradually promoted in this port to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3>Qichang Material Bank Careless</h3>

<h3>Enmity Due to Gambling: Hua Shihao is Chopped to Death. The Murderer, Yang Hanzhang, Admits Without Hesitation. The Corpse of Hua was Inspected by the Court Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Hua Shihao, courtesy name Zhao Kun, a Hubei native who was a teacher at the Jiujiang County Martial Arts Hall and a martial arts instructor at the Independent First Brigade Headquarters of the Marine Corps, lived at No. 51, Jiahe Lane, 81 Hedder Road. However, No. 46 of the lane was the clubhouse of the Hubei Fellow Association, so Hua often went there to play. On the 14th of this month, Hua Shihao had a conflict with Yang Hanzhang, a Hubei native living in the association, due to gambling in the fellow association. The two parties broke up unhappily, accumulating deep hatred. Yang Hanzhang bought two sharp axes on Minguo Road the day before and hid them on his body. At 10:10 PM, he ambushed at the entrance of Jiahe Lane. When he saw Hua Shihao arriving, he suddenly stepped forward, drew out the axe, and chopped down several times on the head, causing Hua to fall to the ground with injuries, and blood gushing like a spring. Yang then abandoned one axe, carried one axe and fled. At the intersection of Gu Xu Road and Haig Road, he was discovered by Indian Constable No. 311, who chased and captured Yang and brought him, along with the axe, to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Zhang Liang was dispatched to send the injured man to Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of the injuries and excessive blood loss, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at about 3 AM the day before. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. Yesterday morning, Yang Hanzhang was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 271 of the Criminal Law for murder and presented the case, requesting a postponement. When questioning Yang Hanzhang, he confessed without hesitation. Judge Huang ordered Yang to be detained for seven days for further interrogation. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Zhang went to the coroner's office to examine the body and determined that Hua Shihao had been chopped to death before death by an axe. The body was handed over to his wife, Hua Wang, who signed a bond to claim the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Duan Meilin Arrested in Japanese Cotton Mill Turmoil</h3>
<p>Recently, strikes have broken out in Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai, and the situation is extremely serious. A large number of workers have been detained by the patrol room for causing trouble and sentenced by the First Special District Court. The Yangshupu Patrol Room and Chinese and Western detectives have found that Duan Meilin (22 years old, living at No. 105, Huaxin Lane, Linqing Road), a Qingjiangpu native who is a workshop secretary at the Second Factory of the Japanese Shanghai Cotton Mill, is suspected of instigating the current labor unrest in the Second and Third Factories of the Japanese Shanghai Mill. Since the 10th of this month to the 18th, Duan has been working intermittently. Whenever he comes to the factory, a turmoil is bound to arise in the factory. Therefore, the detectives arrested Duan at the Second Factory of the Shanghai Cotton Mill at 6:10 PM the day before and copied the names of workers from various cotton mills and many other documents from his home. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhan Liangce interrogated him. The police attorney Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that according to Duan's confession at the police station, the chairman of the workers' group is Yang Xiaoxian, and he is in charge of documentation. Yang Xiaoxian has not yet been captured, and the documents seized still need to be examined. Therefore, he requested permission to detain him, etc. Judge Zhan then interrogated Duan slightly about the documents submitted to the court by the police station, and then ordered that Duan Meilin be allowed to be detained for one week for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ye Qinghua Accused of Marriage and Rape Fraud, Continued Hearing. Mutual Accusations Make the Case Exceptionally Complex. Court Orders Further Summons of Witnesses for Questioning.</h3>
<p>Ye Qinghua, a 38-year-old Fujianese man residing at 115 Rue du Père Robert, French Concession, is a former liquidator of the closed Xiamen Bank. Ye previously worked as a teacher at the Jimei School in Xiamen. At that time, Wu Yu, a female student from the same hometown, came to Shanghai in the 20th year of the Republic of China to study medicine at the Tongde Obstetrics School. Ye was also in Shanghai, pursuing her. A teacher-student relationship developed into love, and they began cohabitating, already having three children. Recently, because Ye</p>
<p>abandoned her,</p>
<p>Wu, represented by Lawyer Yan, filed a complaint with the Second Special District Criminal Court, accusing Ye of marriage fraud, rape, offenses against public morals, and abandonment. The court issued a summons on the 13th of last month for a hearing on the 15th of the same month, ordering the plaintiff to cooperate with the bailiff to summon the defendant. However, on the afternoon of the 13th, Ye, along with his wife, Yang Lanxiang, also known as Zhu Xia (a 36-year-old Cantonese woman), and his girlfriend, Chen Rong, rushed to Room 22 of the Dacheng Apartment on Route Paul Beau and beat Wu Yu. Police officers took the three women, Wu, Yang, and Chen, to the police station for questioning, and then ordered Yang and Chen</p>
<p>to be fined and reprimanded.</p>
<p>Later, Wu, due to her injuries, sought medical treatment at the Jiangwan Women and Children's Education and Rehabilitation Center. She also filed another complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Yang Zhuxia, also known as Lanxiang, and Chen Rong of assault, requesting investigation. On the 15th of last month, Presiding Judge Zhang Chaozuo summoned the defendant. The plaintiff did not appear due to her injuries, only the defendant Ye Qinghua appeared in court. After questioning, the court announced a postponement for further hearing. The circumstances of Yang Zhuxia and Chen Rong also filing a complaint with the Second Special District Criminal Court, accusing Wu Yu of assault, having been summoned several times, but Wu Yu</p>
<p>not appearing due to her injuries, and the postponement of various matters, have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Sun Pengxian resumed the hearing at the Second Criminal Court. Wu Yu's complaint against Ye Qinghua, Yang Zhuxia, and Chen Rong for offenses against public morals and assault were consolidated for trial. The plaintiffs Ye Qinghua and Yang Zhuxia, along with their lawyer, appeared in court. Chen Rong did not appear. The court announced a new trial. According to Wu Yu's statement, she accused the defendant of marriage fraud, rape, and abandonment, and presented letters previously given to her by Ye as evidence. She also claimed that Ye had previously promised to marry her and that they already had three children, the oldest being five years old, who had been</p>
<p>taken by Ye to a friend.</p>
<p>She was also tricked into deceiving his brother, and asked her to sign a separation agreement. At the time, he said he had no wife. Ye testified that his relationship with Wu was a cohabitation and that they had already separated. He had a wife, Yang Lanxiang, whom he married in Xiamen in the 8th year of the Republic of China. He had a relationship with the plaintiff in the 20th year of the Republic of China. She knew he had a wife and was very close to his wife, and they had exchanged letters. Yang Zhuxia testified that Ye Qinghua was her husband and that she married Ye when she was 19 years old. Ye Qinghua also testified that on the 13th of last month, he was in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai by night train. He learned of the summons and went to the court to retrieve it the next day. He denied</p>
<p>colluding with his wife to beat Wu. Wu Yu claimed that Ye Xiping and the tea boy from Number 18 saw Ye outside the Dacheng Apartment. The court showed the separation agreement to Wu to see if it was indeed the agreement. After Wu read it, she said, "It is my signature, but there is no stamp, and there are two clauses added: 'Before I have a fixed occupation, Ye will give me 50 yuan per month for living expenses, and give a reasonable amount of support for the children.' These two clauses were omitted." She claimed that the above witnesses were all Ye's friends. The court reviewed the testimony and, considering that witnesses needed to be summoned for questioning, announced a postponement for further hearing on December 30th. However, Ye also filed a counterclaim against Wu for defamation and false accusation, making the case very complex. Furthermore, Yang Zhuxia's complaint against Wu Yu for assault will continue to be heard this morning.</p>
<h3>### Female Teacher Accuses School Principal, Case is Suspicious. Defendant Claims Both That It Never Happened and That There Was a Reconciliation. Plaintiff Has Never Appeared in Court Since Filing the Lawsuit.</h3>
<p>Lin Jun, principal of Jingping Middle School at 552 Route du Père Robert, French Concession, from Pudong, was recently sued by Shen Fuzhen, a female teacher of English from Suzhou who left the school, in the Second Special District Court, Criminal Division, for offenses against public morals. After several court sessions and summons, the plaintiff has not yet been brought to court. The court discussed postponing the case, as reported in this newspaper. It has been reported that both the plaintiff and the defendant have made statements in the newspaper, saying that it never happened, and that the plaintiff filed a lawsuit in court, requesting to withdraw the lawsuit. The case was heard again yesterday by Presiding Judge Sun Pengxian in the Second Criminal Division, but the plaintiff, Shen Fuzhen, still did not report. Only the defendant's lawyer appeared and said, "The circumstances of this case are very peculiar. The plaintiff is not in court today. She published a newspaper on the 5th of this month saying she knew nothing about the case, but the plaintiff's statement had a lawyer, requesting a thorough investigation." The judge said, "This case could have been processed without a summons. The plaintiff has a withdrawal application that could end the case. Because the case is bizarre, it is being summoned again to clarify what happened. The plaintiff's statement was written by Lawyer You Zhi, and the withdrawal application seems to be two pieces of paper cut and pasted together. Furthermore, the defendant said it never happened, so why did he say there was a reconciliation? It can be seen that there are untruths on the defendant's side." The judge asked the defendant's lawyer, "Does the defendant know where the plaintiff is now?" The defendant's lawyer replied, "The defendant does not know her whereabouts because the plaintiff has been away from the school for a long time." He also presented a newspaper and said, "The plaintiff knew that today's hearing, and sent a letter to my lawyer." The court announced a postponement to 2:00 PM on the 30th for further hearing, and ordered the defendant to appear in court next time.</p>
<h3>Liu Donghai Receives Threatening Letter with Bullet. County Public Security Bureau Has Ordered an Investigation.</h3>
<p>A rural community report states that Liu Donghai, a resident of Huajing Town, Second District, Shanghai County, former head of the Caohang Township Administrative Bureau, a scholarly and literate man, has considerable savings. Donghai, nearly sixty years old, is still as energetic as a young man. Yesterday morning, Donghai found a Chinese-style envelope at the entrance to his house, addressed to "Mr. Liu Donghai." Upon opening it, he found a yellow slip of paper that read, "You have swallowed up the temple property, and I have no place to live. Please write out those 10,000 yuan, or else..." signed "Huajing Weilinggong." It also contained a bullet. Donghai, knowing it was a threatening letter, immediately took it to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to report it. Patrol Officer Yang Hui examined the letter and questioned him, instructing Xia Hai to return home and wait quietly, while reporting the matter to the County Public Security Bureau. It is reported that the County Public Security Bureau has ordered its subordinates to investigate.</p>

The presidium consisted of Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Wang Haifan, Xie Lin, and Bei Zuyi. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, He Yuanming, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Dafu, attended the meeting. The meeting was conducted according to the agenda: (A) Report Items (omitted); (B) Discussion Items (1) Approval for the construction of the association's premises, increasing the budget for land, building, and equipment to 45,000 yuan, authorizing the Construction Committee to be responsible for the implementation; (2) Members Wang Yusheng et al. proposed regarding the levy of income tax, the Ministry's order for the Association to compile accounting systems for various industries, to formulate opinions, and requested a public vote. It was resolved to form an Income Tax Issues Research Committee, with an indefinite number of members, to be notified to the members by letter and convened by the Board of Directors; (3) The Municipal Party Department sent a letter, setting a date to convene various municipal agencies and organizations to discuss and organize the National Contribution of One Day's Income Movement Promotion Committee, hoping to nominate one important person in charge to attend on time. Resolved to delegate to the Board of Directors to designate a representative; (4) (Omitted); (5) (Omitted); (6) In accordance with the Association's charter, the election of officers was conducted. It was resolved that the terms of office for the nine directors and one vacancy, five supervisors, six alternate directors, and two alternate supervisors had expired. The full number of candidates should be submitted immediately, and tellers, vote counters, and recorders were designated. Voting began. As a result of the election, Xi Yushu, Li Hongshou, He Yuanming, Li Dawei, Jiang Wanping, Chen Xianmo, and six others were elected as directors. Xia Sunhuan, Qian Naicheng, Xu Yinghao, Qin Kai, Lu Yangchun, and five others were elected as supervisors. Wang Yusheng, Xu Pei, Zhao Zhenlong, Ye Danian, Sheng Yin, and Chen Luanqing, and six others were elected as alternate directors. Chen Zongshun and Dong Chunbiao, and two others were elected as alternate supervisors. (C) Temporary Motions (1) Members Feng Yixian, Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Li Wenjie, Chen Xianmo, Pan Xulun, Wang Haifan, and others proposed that the bandit-puppet invasion in Suiyuan is a serious situation, and our frontline soldiers are making every effort to eliminate them. The whole country is in grief. In addition to sending a telegram of condolences, the Association should provide material assistance. It was resolved to allocate 1,000 yuan from the Construction Premises Fund for donations and to send letters to all members to actively donate. Donations should be sent to the Association for consolidation and transfer. Over 800 yuan were recognized for donation on the spot by the members, and those who did not donate will be notified by the Association; (2) Member Jiang Wanping proposed, seconded by Shen Xuejun, that during this extraordinary period of national crisis, in addition to the temporary assistance measures in the previous case, there should be long-term and steady response measures. It is proposed to uphold the spirit of perseverance and emulate the German and Italian methods of reducing food and expenses. All members should be notified to reduce daily expenses as much as possible. Entertainment and banquets should be greatly reduced, and even daily necessities should be used only from national products. On the one hand, the Association should open a special savings account for national salvation with state-owned financial institutions. All members or their relatives should send the money saved each month to the account for safekeeping, specially for national salvation needs. It was resolved to pass and instruct the Board of Directors to actively carry out; (3) Member Pan Xulun proposed, seconded by Wang Haifan, that according to the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income of freelancers, whether calculated monthly or annually, should be paid according to half the monthly average. Furthermore, according to the provisions of the Implementation Rules of the Income Tax Law, in calculating the income of freelancers, business expenses should be deducted first, and the balance should be considered income and paid monthly. It is examined that the income of our accountants has a regular or continuous nature, but the monthly income varies greatly due to the quarterly relationship between the settlement of accounts and auditing of various institutions. As for business expenses, they should also be calculated together for a year and cannot be divided monthly. Therefore, in calculating income, the correct amount of monthly average income can only be obtained by deducting the total annual expenses from the total annual income. Therefore, it is really difficult to comply with the monthly declaration and payment of income tax. It is proposed that a telegram be sent to the Ministry of Finance in the name of the entire meeting of over two hundred and forty members of the general assembly today, requesting that the implementation rules of the income tax be modified to change the reporting of the income of freelancers to be done within three months after the annual settlement, and to change the payment of income tax of freelancers to "within a certain number of days after the annual settlement declaration" in order to ensure the accuracy of the calculation of average income. This is our duty, and we respectfully request a public vote. It was resolved to pass and instruct the Board of Directors to handle it expeditiously. (Rest omitted)</p>

<h3>City Federation Petitions for Prohibition of Using Confucius as a Trademark</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizen's Federation, because it found that the Feng Baoji firm at 210 Jiujiang Road, Public Concession, sells imported "Little Luzon" cigars, with Confucius as a trademark, and publishes in newspapers, advertising widely, believes that Confucius is a master teacher of our country's past dynasties, established the foundation of rites and righteousness, laid the foundation of the country, and, like Sun Yat-sen's founding of the Republic, benefited all people. All Chinese people should respect him. How can they be desecrated at will? Furthermore, respect for Confucius has long been ordered to be followed. Now, taking it as a trademark for consumable goods like cigars is a deliberate desecration. Based on the above two points, the federation specially petitions the Ministry of Industry, asking whether to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Little Luzon authorities to cancel or prohibit its domestic sales, and to issue a general ban, prohibiting the use of Confucius as a trademark for any kind of goods in the future, in order to comply with the government's order to respect Confucius and to show the public's respect for sages.</p>
<h3>North Xizang Road Retains Original Road Name</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously decided that after Xizang Road was renamed Yu Qiaqing Road, the North Xizang Road section would also have its "North" removed and be called Xizang Road, etc. It is now learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently changed its original decision and canceled the resolution of July 22 of this year. In the future, North Xizang Road will retain its original name and will not be renamed. The reason is that all streets running west from the Bund to the Suzhou Creek have the same name, with the "North" character appended to the section north of the Suzhou Creek. Now that Xizang Road has been renamed Yu Qiaqing Road, if the northern section must be renamed, it should be renamed "North Yu Qiaqing Road." However, since North Xizang Road is a road name already familiar to the citizens, and the postal and telecommunications services have also become accustomed to it, any changes would likely cause misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Shen Zhenhua Strictly Investigates Opium Smokers</h3>
<p>Shen Zhenhua, chief of the Lao Beimen Police Station, has been diligently carrying out the work of conducting anti-drug propaganda and investigating opium smokers. Recently, as the deadline for the third phase of opium smokers' license renewal is approaching, he has intensified his work. Yesterday, he led officers to search the Wanmu Di area and found over fifty unlicensed opium smokers and those who voluntarily surrendered themselves for rehabilitation. All were taken to the station for questioning and transferred to the General Bureau for disposition. Also, Patrol Officer Hu Chongmin found Xu Shiquan operating an opium den under the guise of a license at 35 Gaodun Road and seized three pauper's licenses that no one claimed. He took them to the station to be sent to the Bureau.</p>

<h3>Increase in Rickshaw License Fees, Request for Change in Handling</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is organizing literacy schools, and the rickshaw association of the special district, due to the increase in rickshaw license fees by the municipal council, has written to the director general requesting that he withdraw the order. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Guarantee The Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council announced that, starting on January 1, the public rickshaw license fee would be increased by 1.50 yuan per month, and the mutual aid society fee would be abolished. The rickshaw association has written to the director general for a guarantee, the original text of which reads: "To the esteemed Director General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, we respectfully submit that we have examined the recent regulations issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, to be implemented from January 1, 1937, increasing the rickshaw license fee by 1.50 yuan per month, to be used as a mutual aid fund. The understanding of our members is that the income from this increased vehicle tax should be entirely allocated by the Shanghai Municipal Council to subsidize the mutual aid society. If the Shanghai Municipal Council stops this subsidy for any reason in the future, the increased vehicle tax should be immediately stopped from being collected. We hope that Your Excellency will grant a guarantee for the views expressed by our members, and we would be grateful."</p>
<p>Letter to Fei Xindun At the same time, the association wrote to Director Fei Xindun, stating: "We respectfully submit that we have read the announcement No. 4758 of your bureau on October 23, which states that the public rickshaw license fee will be set at 3.50 yuan in national currency per vehicle from January 1, 1937, etc. It is known that public rickshaws in the Public Concession pay a monthly license fee of two yuan to the Shanghai Municipal Council, two yuan to the French Municipal Council, and one yuan to the Municipal Government. If the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly increases the public rickshaw license fee to 3.50 yuan, the French Municipal Council and the Municipal Government will inevitably increase it as well, making it unbearable for the rickshaw merchants. On the same day, the public announcement also interpreted that the increased license fee would enable the Shanghai Municipal Council to allocate the increased vehicle tax to subsidize the expenses of the mutual aid society. The association believes that the recent regulations made by the Shanghai Municipal Council have an apparent suspicion of discriminating against and assisting laborers in the concession, so whether this regulation is legal is highly questionable. If the Shanghai Municipal Council really wants to collect the mutual aid fee according to the new system, the association believes that this goal can be achieved through another route, making it equally satisfactory without any illegality. The association is also willing to prepay the 1.50 yuan mutual aid fee per vehicle per month for each rickshaw merchant and collect it from each rickshaw merchant and issue receipts, so that each rickshaw merchant can present the receipts when applying for a license each month, so that the vehicle license will still be two yuan per month, and the clear name of the increased tax can be avoided, and the actions of the Shanghai Municipal Council will not have legal problems. We respectfully report this to you and hope you will consider it with sympathy and reply accordingly."</p>
<p>Calling for Assistance The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to promote literacy education for laborers, recently advocated running rickshaw driver literacy schools, stipulating that each vehicle would pay 0.30 yuan per month. Preparations have already begun and the rickshaw association has been notified to inform all members to comply. The rickshaw merchants have expressed their full agreement with this, but because they are afraid that the increase in license fees by the Shanghai Municipal Council will be followed by simultaneous increases by the French Concession and the Public Concession, it would be truly unbearable in this time of economic hardship. Therefore, they have asked various circles to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to withdraw the increase in fees. The Public Concession issued certificates to the rickshaw owners, stipulating that starting on the first of next month, a handling fee of 0.20 yuan and a deposit of 1 yuan would be collected per vehicle. Yesterday, it issued Instruction No. 3629 to the association ordering them to inform the rickshaw merchants to comply.</p>
<h3>Employees of Silk Factories in Zhabei Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday, Requesting That the Factories Be Ordered to Pay Off Back Wages</h3>
<p>The Yuanxing and Yuanji silk reeling factories on Hutai Road in Zhabei recently announced a shutdown starting on the 29th of last month due to a shortage of raw materials and insufficient reeling. However, since the two factories started operations in May of this year, the wages of their employees have not been fully paid. The workers have found that the factories had considerable profits last year and are now deliberately making excuses, ignoring the workers' livelihoods. They have separately presented the matter to the Party and government authorities, requesting assistance. The Social Affairs Bureau convened two mediations, but no resolution has been reached due to differing opinions between the two parties. The workers have been unemployed for a long time, and as the weather is getting colder, it is difficult to maintain their livelihoods if this continues to be unresolved. Therefore, at 10 a.m. yesterday, over forty workers gathered and walked to the city center to petition the Municipal Government. However, they were stopped from advancing near the Public Security Bureau due to the large number of people. The workers then nominated Tang Shaoxiong, Hua Gendi, Cai Jisheng, Lu Huaisan, and Li Acai, and six others, as representatives to submit a petition to the Municipal Government. Zhang Shiwu from the Second Section of the Administration received them, inquired about the situation, and promised to order the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate immediately. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Wang Xianqing from the Third Section received them, stating that the dispute had been reported to the Director for review, and asked the workers to wait quietly for a resolution. The workers dispersed around 1 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fishery Loan Syndicate Making Efforts to Investigate, Loans to be Released in Spring Fishing Season, 120,000 Already Loaned Out by Three Banks</h3>
<p>The Fishery Loan Syndicate, organized by the Ministry of Industry in conjunction with China, Communications, and twelve other banks, appointed Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhihua, and Gui Yanfang as preparatory committee members, and established a preparatory office, starting operations at the Xinhua Bank. All three drafts of the organizational regulations, operating rules, and work outline have been approved by the two preparatory meetings and submitted to the Ministry for record. It is reported that the total amount of the syndicate's funds is one million yuan. 200,000 of which will be undertaken by the Ministry, has been written to the Ministry of Finance. The remaining 800,000 yuan has been prepared by the participating banks according to the amount they have determined to pay. Regarding the syndicate's business policy, the general rules for the organization of various fishery production and marketing cooperatives, the investigation of fishery conditions, and the current status of fishery cooperatives, the preparatory office has dispatched personnel to carry out these tasks separately and has scheduled a third preparatory meeting this week to discuss further progress. The date of its official establishment will be determined after the completion of various investigation tasks. However, in order to relieve the fishermen, the loans will be started no later than the spring fishing season next year. Up to 120,000 yuan have been jointly loaned out by the Zhonghui and Xinhua and the Four Banks Savings Association. Now that the winter fishing season has arrived, applications are pouring in and all the loans will soon be loaned out.</p>
<h3>Directors of Various Party and National Flag Branches Request Instructions on Handling Remaining Matters</h3>
<p>After the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau was ordered to cease operations, the Bureau relayed the order to the branch bureaus in various provinces to comply. The directors of the branch bureaus believed that the branch sales offices in the counties under their jurisdiction had a large number of flags in stock, and that complying with the order to close required all matters such as the remaining flags to be resolved first. They had sent letters and telegrams to the Bureau requesting instructions, but the Bureau replied that it had already requested instructions from the Central Government and would notify them as soon as the approval was received. Because it had been a long time and no approval had been received, the directors of the various branch bureaus had come to Shanghai one after another. Yesterday, they went to the Bureau to appeal for the resolution of the remaining matters and the return of the flag prices. Changwei and Zhangchi received them and replied that the Bureau could not deal with the matter until the Central Government's plan for handling remaining matters was received. Because they could not get any substantial results, the directors convened a meeting at the Yangtze Hotel yesterday to discuss a solution.</p>

<h3>Private Counterfeiting Case Adjourned for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>The French police recently uncovered a private counterfeiting of nickel coins at 110 Kangti Road, seized the suspects, and confiscated the molds and counterfeit coins. Yesterday, the police sent the suspects Wang Jinrong, Wang Anshi, Yuan Baoyu, and Gu Chaode to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. After Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the police affairs department, requested a postponement of the investigation, he sued for trial. After Wang Gangxu, the court judge, reviewed the report and briefly questioned the defendants, he adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 27th and remanded the defendants in custody.</p>
<h3>Further Capture of Bandit Accomplices</h3>
<p>The Wang family residing at No. 2 Hongfu Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, was burgled on October 27th last year, with valuables worth over 1,000 yuan stolen. Recently, the Municipal Police Bureau arrested five bandits including Xu Fusheng, who confessed that their accomplice, Song Laisheng, had committed other burglaries in the concession. He was handed over to the First Special District Court for trial, sentenced to eight years and two months imprisonment, and is currently serving his sentence.</p>
<p>The other day, the Municipal Police Bureau transferred him for further questioning. According to his statement, another accomplice, a Ningbo native named Wang Fengchun, provided firearms, and Li A’ming acted as a lookout. Wang resided at No. 17 Yuanfang Road, and Li lived at No. 60 Mike Road. Detective Zhu Lie of the Criminal Investigation Team then contacted the Hongkou and Zhabei police stations, requesting their assistance in the arrest. Chinese detectives Yang Xinzheng, Zhang Desheng, and detective Chen Jinsheng were dispatched to arrest Wang and Li at their respective addresses. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated that the two defendants denied the charges at the police station and requested that they be temporarily detained pending a public summons from the Shanghai Local Court. According to Song Laisheng, the Fangbang Road Hongfu Lane robbery involved eight people, including Wang, Li, and the five arrested bandits including Xu Fusheng. Afterward, Wang received 50 yuan and a gold ring, and Li also received 50 yuan and a watch. The two defendants claimed that this was a false accusation due to previous gambling disputes. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody for further hearing this Friday.</p>
<h3>Mischievous Child Climbs Onto Back of Truck, Falls and Gets Injured When Truck Starts</h3>
<p>A cargo truck, No. 12208 from the Shanghai Municipal Council’s South Shanghai Engineering Department, was being driven by driver Jiang A’rong. At 5 PM yesterday, while passing the Old West Gate, the truck stopped at a red light.

When the light turned green and the truck moved forward, the other two mischievous children jumped off the back of the truck, but one child named Jiang Xiaomao fell and was seriously injured, unable to move. A police officer on duty witnessed the incident and took the injured child to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. His injuries were severe.</p>
<p>The driver was taken to the West Gate Branch Bureau for questioning and it was determined that the driver was not at fault. The mischievous child’s parents were to blame for their lack of discipline. The Public Works Department released Jiang on bail.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Enamel Industry (Continued) (An Overview of Shanghai Industries - No. 38)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>1. Huafeng Enamel Co., Ltd. – The factory was established in 1928, funded by Liu Hongsheng and others, with a registered capital of 300,000 yuan, increased by 8,900 yuan. The current chairman of the board is Mr. Li Bake, the managing director is Mr. Ji Zhishi, and the assistant manager is Mr. Hu Linsheng. The factory is located in Zhoujiabo, Pudong, and the sales office is located on Laobeimen Street. In the past, it formed a joint sales office with Zhufeng and other factories on Avenue Edward VII to eliminate competition, but this has now expired. The base of the factory in Pudong is worth approximately 123,000 yuan, the machinery in the factory is worth approximately 120,000 yuan, the 24 furnaces are worth approximately 35,600 yuan, and other various models are worth over 20,000 yuan. The factory's main product is washbasins, with the "Ruyi" brand trademark. The turnover has increased year by year, and in recent years it has reached about 1 million yuan per year. As for operating profits and losses, they often fluctuate due to the influence of the situation and competition. Last year, there was a loss of 25,268.18 yuan.

<p>Chronicles</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Tai Xuan)</p>
<p>The three stages of life can be compared to crossing a bridge: youth is like ascending the bridge, middle age is like crossing the bridge, and old age is like descending the bridge.</p>
<p>These few words may seem like platitudes at first glance, but if you savor them carefully, they contain profound meaning. When ascending the bridge, you must take each step steadily and without haste, to avoid stumbling. Similarly, during the period of youth, one should concentrate on studying, progressing gradually until completing one's studies. This is the first stage of life, the first stage of ascending the bridge.</p>
<p>Once on the bridge, the path is relatively smooth. Middle age is like applying one's knowledge, unleashing one's full potential to accomplish life's most important tasks. This is the second stage of life, the second stage of crossing the bridge.</p>
<p>Watching the elderly slowly descend the bridge step by step undoubtedly signifies their declining energy, requiring rest and enjoyment. This work of descending the bridge is, of course, the final stage of life. Bridges, whether east, west, north, or south, can be crossed back and forth, but can people return to their youth? The ancients said, "If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll regret it when you're old." This is a good warning for young people.</p>
<h3>Spy Jokes in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Bili</p>
<p>Modern cities are battlegrounds for spies to compete and win. Some use ingenious disguises, some use secret communications, and some use the dimples of beautiful women. People from friendly countries are famous for going to various countries to spy on various secrets, and at the same time, there are many foreign spies active in Tokyo. Therefore, the work of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is always tense.</p>
<p>One day, a woman named Osawa came to the police station, looking very flustered. She reported to the police chief: "My husband, Nagami, has been acting suspiciously lately, and his whereabouts are erratic. He often receives letters from Moscow, which he locks away very secretly. I suspect that he is a Russian spy because I love my country, so I came to report it. A week ago, he received a letter from Vladivostok and hurried out, and has not returned since. I am afraid there is a major incident, so please pay attention to the investigation."</p>
<p>The police station immediately became tense after receiving this report. They first quietly sent detectives to search Osawa's home. After a thorough inspection, nothing suspicious was found except for a large pile of letters from Moscow in the safe. Nagami runs a leather goods shop, and his accounts showed that he was heavily in debt. The letters from Moscow were just ordinary talk about leather goods transactions, but the police station thought they were worth studying and took them back for investigation. The police station also inquired with police stations and customs offices in various places, but there was no record of anyone named Nagami leaving the country. The more they investigated, the more confused they became, and the more confused they became, the more serious the case seemed. After four or five days of this, Nagami was finally found. The spy ringleader was arrested. Nagami was found by police officers in a forest on the outskirts of Tokyo, looking like neither a human nor a ghost. When he was arrested, his wife Osawa rushed to the police station, and the truth of the case was revealed. Osawa said: "My husband is really not a spy. Lately, he has been depressed because his business has failed and he is heavily in debt. He disappeared a week ago, and I was very anxious and could not find him, so I fabricated the story that he was a spy and reported it to the police station, asking the police officers to put in extra effort to find this person. Now, thank you for finding him."</p>
<p>The great spy case came to an end.</p>
<h3>How to Wear a Hat?</h3>
<p>— Xu Jichen</p>
<p>There is a psychology professor at a university in Bolivia, South America, named Alina. She says, "I have always adhered to a principle as my standard for choosing a partner: how does that man wear his hat? Some men like to wear their hats to the side, some tilt them to the right, covering their ears. This is a sign of cunning and fickleness. These people are generally unreliable. There are also people who wear their hats over their eyes, almost covering them completely. These people will never take risks in their lives. They are very timid and can never accomplish great things. Just imagine, can a man who is more timid than a woman be called a husband? There are also those who wear their hats very far back, exposing their faces and foreheads completely. These people are reckless. If you marry such a person, you must prepare to be a widow, or remarry. A man must wear his hat squarely, without leaning to the left or right, or tilting forward or backward. This is our standard for women to choose a partner."</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, when we go out to the streets and see many men wearing felt hats, they are always styled in a three-seven split, with a greasy look. Or they wear their hats on top of their heads, covering even the back of their heads. Most of the hooligans who stick out their thumbs and roll up their sleeves are like this. Calling them "reckless" is certainly very appropriate. Wearing a hat squarely, and following the rules in every move, is naturally a sign of a "formal person." As for those who wear their hats askew, or hats covering their eyelids, these people are probably young, and when they see women on the road, whether it's one or two, their glistening eyes will shoot out a flame from the edge of their hats; of course, they are fickle and not people you can rely on for life! Some people even wear melon-skin caps, also tilted to one side. These people are either ushers in theaters, or leisurely people carrying birdcages, or the bosses of bookstores, or even the people who live off the mountains and rivers!</p>
<p>Ms. Alina's theory above is very helpful to us. Although we can't say that a man's way of wearing a hat is the golden rule for choosing a partner, sometimes we find it very effective.</p>
<p>Ladies, ladies who seek happiness, whether or not your partner is suitable is tied to your lifelong joys and sorrows. If you want to hunt down a passionate and righteous partner, the first step should be to take Alina's words as your motto.</p>
<p>This is a philosophy of wearing a hat, and also an art of wearing a hat. Brothers and sisters, go and savor it carefully.</p>
<h3>Guides</h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>The guides referred to here are not the kind that use women's sex appeal as an enticement like the common variants of prostitution. These guides are formally engaged in guiding work, and their only customers are passengers on ocean liners passing through Shanghai.</p>
<p>They have no organization and go to the customs baggage inspection area or the docks where huge ships are docked to find customers on their own. Dressed in beautiful suits, when they walk on the deck and hear someone saying, "Shanghai is a good place," they will politely approach them and say in fluent English:</p>
<p>"Sir, I am a guide in Shanghai. Would you like me to take you sightseeing?"</p>
<p>Naturally, these passengers will be suspicious of these unfamiliar Chinese people, especially since they have heard that there are many swindlers in Shanghai! So he will tell the passengers: all the expenses on shore (such as taxi fares) will be paid by him, until you have finished your tour to your satisfaction, and then you will repay him the amount, and in addition, give him some "tips" at will.</p>
<p>After receiving a customer, they usually go out by car, but the guide is unwilling to spend three yuan an hour on taxi fares to make money for the taxi company. He has already contacted those black-plate unlicensed taxis parked on the docks, and the fares are naturally cheaper, but he still reports three yuan per hour to the guest, just because he can profit from it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Three Renunciations</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>This is a true story from my hometown. The protagonist is the fourth daughter of a former county magistrate. From a young age, the fourth daughter was betrothed under her parents' orders. Unfortunately, ten years ago, when she was seventeen, her fiancé died of illness. She was deeply affected by this and further influenced by traditional moral teachings. She cried and demanded to live a life of chastity. Her parents strongly opposed this, so she went on a hunger strike to coerce them. After persuasion from relatives and friends, she compromised and entered a Buddhist nunnery. Her parents allowed her to practice her faith with her hair intact, but she insisted on shaving her head, again using a hunger strike as leverage. Her parents couldn't resist her, so they had to let her shave her head and take the Buddhist name Lianyin.</p>
<p>The fourth daughter's decision to become a nun was merely a momentary impulse. After shaving her head, the morning bells and evening drums, vegetarian meals, and meditation created a life of sorrow and loneliness that she naturally couldn't endure. However, she stubbornly kept up appearances but suffered in her heart. Whenever her mother came to visit, her face would be covered in tears and snot. Her mother understood her daughter's psychology, so she often provoked her with words. The old nuns were especially perceptive when dealing with the wives and daughters of gentlemen's families and tried to encourage her. After a year, the fourth daughter returned to secular life, grew her hair back, and sought a new match.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty, the fourth daughter married a newly widowed elementary school principal introduced by her cousin. The wedding was scheduled for February, but unexpectedly, the elementary school principal died of illness. The fourth daughter cried for two nights in a fit of anger. Taking advantage of a moment when no one was watching, she cut off her black hair again and secretly returned to the nunnery where she had originally practiced. However, her mother couldn't bear to let her daughter become a nun, so she asked many relatives to persuade her to return home and find another suitable match. The fourth daughter was adamant in her refusal. After much persuasion, they finally agreed to send her to Shanghai to study, to seek independence and no longer mention marriage.</p>
<p>Once in Shanghai, she lived in the school dormitory, studied diligently, and made rapid progress. She gradually forgot her past pain. Later, she gradually developed a romantic relationship with a classmate's brother, starting from friendship. Three years ago, when she was twenty-five, she officially married. I even went to congratulate her on her wedding. They were a perfect couple, and their love was excellent after the wedding. Last year, they had a daughter. Unexpectedly, their beloved daughter died young this spring, and in the autumn, her husband died of typhoid fever. This shock was naturally even deeper than the previous two. Therefore, she followed her parents-in-law's advice and returned to her mother's home temporarily to mourn.</p>
<p>But I received news yesterday that she had attempted suicide and was rescued. Recently, she shaved her head again and devoted herself to a Buddhist temple.</p>
<h3>The Phoenix Replaces the Oriole</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Vows Made with a Cup of Water, Talking of Woe Under the Green Lamp; Golden Rings and Red Beans Convey Yearning</p>
<p>Menglan heard this and exclaimed "Ah ya!" expressing surprise. Youmei said, "Ah ya what? I don't think this is outside the realm of human emotions." Menglan said, "It's nothing to send a friend a gift or two. But a gold ring like this shouldn't be given to just anyone." Youhai said, "Of course, in my opinion, it can't be seen as a casual act on your part. If you feel this ring isn't appropriate to give, I'm just delivering a gift for someone else, so of course I can't force you." Saying this, she put the ring on the table. Menglan supported her right hand with her left, looking at the ring finger on her left hand where she used to wear a ring. She frowned slightly, smiled, and slowly said, "If we get along well with each other, it's not excessive to give a ring. But if our friendship is limited to letters, that's too superficial. How could I give him something I wear myself?" Youmei laughed, "If that's the case, I'm trying to teach a master craftsman. I've heard two stories before. One person could play the zither, and another person understood it. Later, when that person died, he burned the zither. Another person was wearing a sword, and a friend saw it and wanted it. But he was under orders from the emperor, so he gave it to his friend. Later, when his official business was done, his friend had died, so he hung the sword on the tree by his grave." Menglan laughed, "That person, that person, you said seven or eight of them, I can't keep it straight." Youmei laughed, "When you hear me say this, please forgive me. I don't have any historical allusions in my head, I can't help but say it. Can you learn from the ancients?" Menglan laughed, "It's just that your two metaphors aren't very auspicious." Youmei said, "That's right. The ancients didn't give away the sword at the time, so the omen wasn't good. If you give it away immediately, you won't have the same bad outcome as the ancients." Menglan still looked down at her finger. She pondered for a long, long time before saying, "Since that's the case, then take it." (101)</p>

<h3>Visiting the Osmanthus at Zhu Nunnery</h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>Zhu Nunnery is located southeast of Jiaxing County, less than ten li from the county seat. The location is remote and the site is small, not as magnificent and grand as the Lingyan and Lenyen temples in the city. However, the nunnery has two osmanthus trees that are hundreds of years old. During the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns, the county suffered from war. The sweet pear trees that shaded the duke of Shao's court and the tall trees of noble families were destroyed and damaged, and few survived. The osmanthus trees of the nunnery were preserved because they were located in a remote village, escaping the axes of woodcutters. As the years passed, their presence became increasingly majestic and beautiful. The nunnery is famous for its osmanthus trees, making it one of the famous scenic spots in the county. On the twenty-third day of the ninth month of the Bingzi year, the osmanthus trees were in full bloom, and the autumn light was clear and bright. Suddenly moved by the pleasant scenery, I took a walk to visit them alone. Leaving the old site of the south gate, I walked south along the side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. After crossing three bridges, I went down the railway and walked southeast until I reached a body of water with a stone beam spanning it from east to west, called Jiangshui Bridge. Crossing the bridge and walking southeast, after several turns, I looked north at a small nunnery with red walls by the roadside, named Zhiyuan She Nunnery. The locals simply call it She Nunnery, pronouncing "she" as "shai". After passing She Nunnery, I continued southeast. Looking east by the roadside, there was a village with lush forests and houses, called Xuejia Du. Arriving here, I didn't know how far I was from Zhu Nunnery, so I entered the village to find someone to ask. The creek was damp and meandered around the village. Looking around, all the doors were closed, and there was no trace of anyone. It must have been because the harvest of rice had not yet begun, and everyone was busy harvesting. The men and women of the village were all in the fields. While wandering around, I looked across the creek and saw two or three village children playing by the water. I hurried to their location to ask them. As I approached, they saw a stranger and scattered in all directions like startled wild geese or frightened deer, running through the forests and streams. I shouted loudly, and two dogs under the eaves, fierce as tigers and leopards, were startled by the sound and barked madly. The owner of the dogs heard the noise and came out, shouting at them. The two dogs then lowered their ears and wagged their tails, leaving. I asked about the location of Zhu Nunnery, and they pointed to the roof tiles vaguely visible among the evergreen pine and cypress trees in the southeast, saying, "That's it." Calmed down and regained my composure, I followed their directions. After a short while, I arrived at a stone bridge called Zhuanghou Bridge. The stream was like a ribbon, clear to the bottom. Climbing the bridge and looking southeast, I saw a structure by the river a few dozen feet away, with sparse trees. This was Zhu Nunnery. The ancient fragrance of osmanthus had already arrived with the wind, strong and refreshing. I went down the bridge and entered the nunnery, which occupied a small area surrounded by white walls. In the courtyard were two osmanthus trees, arranged on the left and right. My feet were tired from walking for a long time, so I rested under the trees, focusing on observing them. I saw old trunks and gnarled branches extending in all directions, winding like dragons and snakes, and curling like arms and legs. The moss was mottled, and their ancient strangeness was hard to describe. Ropes and cables were tied around them, each tree divided into five platforms, arranged in an orderly manner, with the height not overlapping. The green leaves were luxuriant, and the golden flowers were scattered. As the flowers were blooming, I remembered visiting the nunnery with my late mother when I was a child while visiting family graves. At that time, the nunnery had an old neighbor, who was sixty or seventy years old, who explained that the osmanthus trees were originally two, one on the left, whose age was unknown, and one on the right, which had withered in its old age. He had personally seen it replanted when he was young, so its trunk was smaller. According to the old man, the age of the tree on the right was about the same as his own. Now, another fifty years have passed, so the tree on the left is also over a hundred years old. The children like me who used to play bamboo games are now getting old, not far from the age of the old man. Recalling the past, I felt lost. Therefore, I composed a seven-character quatrain: "I once visited the Buddhist palace with my mother, recognizing the snow geese that were the previous life of the golden millet. For fifty years, nothing has happened. The double osmanthus trees of Zhu Nunnery are in the autumn wind again." After finishing the poem, I recited it several times, unable to overcome the feeling of wasting my life. The nunnery used to have nuns, but now there is only one old woman who serves the incense. When guests arrive, she cooks tea and offers refreshments, fulfilling the duties of a hostess. I then paid my respects to the Buddha statue, looked around the hall, and lingered for a long time before leaving the nunnery. Passing Zhuanghou Bridge, I saw an ancient tomb on the east side of the bridge, with a magnificent layout and lush pine and cypress trees. Among the scattered weeds, a stone tablet stood tall. I read it and it was titled "Double Osmanthus Hall". How strange, the theory of geography, half of the world believes it, such a coincidence, there is probably heaven in it. According to old legends, the site of the nunnery belongs to the southeast corner of the county seat. Going southeast from the nunnery, there is Zhutian Village, the former residence of Zhang Shuwei Tingji. Mr. Zhang was famous throughout the country for his learning, and his father and son both led the Zhejiang provincial examinations, but neither was able to become a Jinshi. The story of osmanthus trees is originally a sign of academic success. The flowers bloom in the autumn, so they only indicate success in the provincial examinations. The double osmanthus trees must also be the response of Zhang Minqiao's clan. The old rumors are like this, so the descendants of the so-called Double Osmanthus Hall probably also benefited from the shade of the osmanthus trees of the nunnery, and once occupied a high position in the court at that time? I don't know. Walking, walking, and walking again, I followed the old road home. By the time I arrived home, it was noon.</p>

<h3>The Last Game of the First Round of the Tung Wah League: Tung Wah vs. French Club on Saturday at Recreation Ground; The Victory or Defeat Concerns the Championship of Group A; Kwong Nan vs. Portuguese on Sunday at Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>The most important match of the Western League soccer this weekend is Tung Wah vs. French Club, held on Saturday at Recreation Ground. This is the last game of Tung Wah's first round. In the past results, Tung Wah has seven wins and one draw, while French Club has six wins and one draw. Since they still have one game against Shaheir, French Club will definitely win.</p>
<p>The results of this year's Group A are still not out of the pattern of the previous two years, with Tung Wah and French Club competing for the championship. This has become an inevitable fact. Looking at the French Club's lineup, it is stronger than when they won the championship in the previous two years. This is because their talents are average, and they are brave and good at fighting. Tung Wah is the elite of the Chinese people, with concentrated talent, and their soccer skills have reached perfection. It is a pity that their stamina is not as good as French Club, which is a concern for all soccer fans. Based on the last performance match for birthday congratulations and the game against Rucks yesterday, it seems difficult for Tung Wah to defeat French Club. But if they can strengthen their defense and the forwards plan to connect on both wings, it will not be difficult to achieve victory. Tung Wah is eager to win the championship and will definitely plan well.</p>
<p>Although this match is not enough to determine who will win the championship, it is extremely important to the championship's success or failure. The future situation of this season's league can be summarized from this.</p>
<p>In addition, Kwong Nan vs. Portuguese on Sunday at Hongkou Park. Portuguese once won against West Postal by five to four, and West Postal lost to Kwong Nan by two to four. Based on this, it is not difficult for Kwong Nan to win three consecutive matches. The team's soccer skills have improved significantly recently, and their connections are quite impressive. The Portuguese team's strength is not as good as before due to the departure of Costa and Colasa.</p>

<h3>Youth and Middle-aged Basketball Shooting Competition - Registration Closes Tonight - Competition Starts at 7 PM Tomorrow Night - Further Explanation of Competition and Scoring Methods</h3>
<p>The public basketball shooting competition organized by the Youth and Middle-aged Association is scheduled to be held tomorrow night in the gymnasium of its Sichuan Road Clubhouse. However, as this competition is not yet popular in Shanghai, the number of participants has not been very enthusiastic. To encourage participation, the Association has specially prepared exquisite trophies displayed in the clubhouse's public exhibition area. To promote the event, the registration period has been extended, and registration is still possible until 9 PM tonight. Regardless of the number of participants, the competition will proceed as scheduled. Basketball shooting is the first step in practicing basketball. Shanghai is not short of basketball masters, and it is hoped that they will participate to spark interest in honing their skills. The competition rules and scoring methods are explained in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) One-Minute Close-Range Shot: Players stand at any point under the basket, ready to shoot. Upon hearing the referee's command, they begin shooting. The time limit is one minute. Each successful shot scores one point.</p>
<p>(2) Standing Long-Range Shot: Men stand 25 feet from the basket, and women and teenagers stand 20 feet from the basket. There are five designated spots. Each shot is taken once, and each successful shot scores five points.</p>
<p>(3) One-and-a-Half-Minute Dribbling: There are five designated spots under the basket. Players stand at the first spot, ready to dribble. Upon the referee's command, they begin dribbling and shooting. After shooting from each spot, regardless of whether the shot is successful, the player must dribble the ball back to the second spot, and then dribble and shoot from the second to the third, fourth, and fifth spots, following the designated order. The time limit is one and a half minutes. Each successful shot scores two points.</p>
<p>(4) Ten Free Throws: Taken from the free-throw line. Each successful shot scores three points.</p>
<p>(5) Long-Range Shot and Follow-Up: The spots are the same as for the standing long-range shot. Players start from the first spot and proceed in order. Each spot has one long-range shot and one follow-up shot. At the start, after the long-range shot, regardless of whether it is successful, the player immediately follows up to retrieve the ball and shoot again. However, after receiving the ball, the player may not dribble forward or walk with the ball. Any violation will invalidate the shot, even if successful. Each successful shot scores three points for the long-range shot and two points for the follow-up shot.</p>
<p>The champion is the player with the highest total score from the five categories. A runner-up and third-place winner will also be decided. If there is a tie in scores, the tie will be broken by another one-minute close-range shot.</p>

<h3>Cultural Circles Tensely Supporting Suiyuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cultural circles' support association for the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan, since its establishment, convened a standing committee meeting a few days ago and decided to carry out various fundraising methods. It is now learned that, to actively promote this, the association has first designated persons in charge of each unit to separately make contact, and is rushing to produce receipts for submission to designated banks to collect donations. Once the preparatory procedures are completed, the association will convene persons in charge of each unit to discuss practical implementation methods. Various schools, bookstores, and cultural organizations have already begun to raise funds to meet the urgent needs of the front lines.</p>
<p>Fudan University: The entire faculty and students of Fudan University are sparing no effort in supporting Suiyuan. President Qian Xinzhi and Vice President Wu Nanxuan initiated a "Thrifty National Salvation Movement," with three methods: thrifty boxes, thrifty coupons, and thrifty banquets. It is said that the thrifty coupons are being actively printed and will be available for sale soon. The thrifty box was inaugurated yesterday morning after the flag-raising ceremony on the large playground. The Vice President first described the general idea of the significance of thrifty national salvation, stating that supporting Suiyuan and saving the nation lies in active persistence, and that there is no better method than thrifty national salvation. He then described the use of the thrifty box: all donations to the box should be placed in small envelopes, and donors should write their name, address, and donation amount on both sides of the envelope. The box will be opened publicly once a week. Wu then threw the savings from President Qian, Professor Ren Lifu, and himself, as well as the savings from the school's banquet for faculty and staff, into the box. Subsequently, Dean of Academic Affairs Zhang Yi, Professor Sun Hanbing, and students and workers flocked to the thrifty box and threw in their respective savings.</p>
<p>Tongji University: Students at Tongji University launched a fundraising campaign to support Suiyuan. The first round of donations, with over 400 participants, was remitted on the 17th. In the second round, class leaders from each grade expanded the fundraising efforts, and faculty and staff donated one day's salary, raising over 700 yuan, which was also sent directly to Suiyuan through the Bank of China on the 20th, along with a telegram expressing encouragement to fight to the end. The affiliated vocational school and middle school are still raising funds for future remittances.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University: All faculty, staff, and workers of Jiaotong University in this city have decided to donate one day's salary to comfort the soldiers in Suiyuan, totaling over 1,700 yuan.

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Seeks Movie Scripts - "Sunset Over a Lonely City" by Wang Pingling and Wang Mengou Selected</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department's solicitation of educational film scripts has yielded remarkable results. The second selected script, "The Heart of a Loving Mother" by Wang Pingling, has already been handed over to the Shanghai Star Film Company for filming. The result of the current solicitation is that "Sunset Over a Lonely City," a collaboration between Wang Pingling and Wang Mengou, has been selected. The drama is based on the story of Tang general Zhang Xun's isolated army defending Suiyang, resisting An Lushan of the Jie tribe, and the people's oath to die rather than surrender. It also tells the story of Nan Jiyun breaking through the siege to seek help, and ultimately dying for the country when supplies ran out and reinforcements failed to arrive. The entire play is tragic, heroic, and intensely gripping, making it a famous historical drama relevant to modern times. It is said that, for the sake of prudence, the department intends to entrust the production to the Hejia Company, but this is still under consideration.</p>

The ceremony began with solemnity and order amid the melodious sounds of strings.</p>
<p>Principal's Report</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Principal Liu Haisu first reported that the school was founded in the first year of the Republic of China, born at the same time as the Republic of China. From the first year of the Republic of China to the present, it has been a period of great transformation for our country's political system. The Art College was born at this time, shouldering the mission of emerging art. In the history of art, it also marks a great divide. Over the past 25 years, we have worked hard to build it up. Fortunately, with the support of society, we have achieved today's scale. In the future, we will continue to uphold the inherent culture of the past, absorb new Western art ideas, observe the trends of the times, and understand the future of life, so that we can create art that represents the soul of the times, and inspire the great personality and independent spirit of our people. This is the great mission that all members of this school are committed to working hard to achieve. We hope that society will continue to support and guide us to complete it.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo's Speech</p>
<p>Our school has been established for 25 years. Our country's art schools began with this. Our school has always embraced the promotion of national culture and has always adhered to this proposition. Today, the country is declining. This determination is not only a responsibility that a single school or a single person should bear, nor can it be fully exerted by a single school or a single person. However, looking around at art schools in the East, West, South, and North, there is more than just this one school. However, judging from the proof of facts, our school is in a leading position, and it has also devoted the most effort to the country and the nation in the past. I have always advocated national salvation based on one's own position. The so-called position is the meaning of self-reliance. We are standing from the standpoint of art, and we should work hard in the field of art to assist the country and the nation in moving forward. Minister of Education Wang then spoke on behalf of Xiao Youmei, and Mayor Wu spoke on behalf of Zhang Yuanruo. Both encouraged the school to promote the movement of cultural renaissance in our country in order to realize the renaissance of the nation. Representatives from the municipal party headquarters and the municipal social affairs bureau, as well as school board member Zhang Shouyong, successively gave speeches, commending and encouraging the school. Finally, representatives of faculty, alumni, and students delivered congratulatory speeches, and the meeting adjourned with music. The venue was filled with congratulatory gifts from all walks of life. The Boy Scouts of Danhua Elementary School and the military training students of the school assisted in maintaining order at the venue.</p>

The celebration banquet was reportedly held last night at the Yihai Tang, attended by hundreds of school board members, faculty, staff, alumni, students, and their families.

<h3>Yarn - Spot Sales Show Signs of Improvement - Cotton Yarn Price Increase Still Fierce</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the momentum is still tense. The reason is that yarn sales have improved, and buyers from Tianjin, the interior, Changsha, Guangdong, and other regions are very enthusiastic. Spot yarn is extremely tight, so many parties are actively involved. However, the gold industry has released a large amount, and some have already gone short. However, those who absorb it are still pouring in. However, with the clouds of war looming in Suiyuan, the transaction volume has greatly increased, and the future changes are difficult to predict. Dachangcheng and Changfeng are selling 10,000 to 15,950 bales.</p>
<p>Speculative Yarn Shorts Also Eager to Cover</p>
<p>The speculative yarn market opened lower due to the serious war situation in Suiyuan. It was hoped that the labor unrest would be resolved, and the gold industry continued to sell off. The current month fell by four corners, a continuous drop of one yuan and four and six corners. In the second round, there was a slight rebound. By the third close, it was reported that Tianjin, Changsha, and Guangdong buyers, seeing the improvement in spot yarn sales and the firmness of raw cotton, suddenly increased their buying, and the market quickly turned upwards with good momentum, trending higher again. As a result, the closing prices for each month were up one yuan to one yuan and four and six corners compared to the previous day's closing price. The market remained tense after the afternoon opening. Because the labor unrest in the Japanese factories has not been completely resolved, and spot yarn transactions are smooth, shorts are eager to cover, and the rise is particularly strong. At the close, it was reported that yarn sales were over 2,700 bales. As a result, the closing prices for each month rose another nine corners to one yuan and seven corners compared to the morning closing price. Yuda sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. It was found that Changfeng had settled 15,950 bales of long positions, Dachangcheng 10,000 bales, Dafu 1,700 bales, Changji 1,950 bales, Fengtai 1,100 bales, Fukang 1,850 bales, Taichang 2,000 bales, Dachang 1,400 bales, and Jinchang 800 bales. Mingde bought 4,900 bales, Yiji 2,000 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Heyu 2,650 bales, Guangfeng 5,700 bales, Shenji 6,150 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, Wang Taixing 1,900 bales, Xincheng 3,800 bales, and Tonghe 1,600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and the closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales of Over 2,700 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are brisk. It was found that buyers purchased a total of 2,785 bales from various firms throughout the day, with prices rising by two yuan. The buying volume of each firm is as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 720, Jiangxi 30, Inland 675, Nanjing 10</p>
<p>Sichuan 250, Changsha 365, Shantou 10</p>
<p>Guangdong 480, Yunnan 30, Peers 25</p>
<h3>Cotton - Long Positions and Short Covering Rise Together - Forward Prices Have Exceeded the Two Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The cotton market saw both US cotton and Indian cotton rebound, and the yarn market was brisk, which boosted confidence. Flour companies and securities companies continued to increase their positions, leading to a shortage of supply. At the same time, factory demand showed some signs of improvement, and market prices moved forward step by step. The forward month price has broken through the two yuan mark.</p>
<p>Speculative Flowers - Consistent Dragging by Non-Industry Players</p>
<p>The speculative flower market opened with a tight and lively atmosphere, as several yarn factories had already resumed production, and short positions were covering in the near term. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and the market was firm. In addition, US cotton forward prices rebounded by 20 points and Indian cotton also rose by 1.2 rupees, making the market even stronger. Market prices advanced step by step, with forward months breaking through the two yuan mark. As a result, the closing prices for each month rose by 0.3 to 0.55 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Due to the consistent dragging by outside investors and large players, the market became even stronger and buying interest was very strong after the afternoon opening. However, some, due to the good harvest of this Geng year, were still selling off when prices rose. As a result, the closing prices for each month rose another 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 6,300 dan, Jinchang 6,800 dan, Taixing 3,5900 dan, Xingchang 6,900 dan, Shenji 2,700 dan, Changfeng 6,000 dan, Dachang 10,900 dan, Shengyuan 7,900 dan, Xinchang 7,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 7,400 dan, Changhe 2,500 dan, Fengtai 2,000 dan, and Hengchang 4,300 dan.

<h3>Spring Cloth Sales Already Underway; Prices Mostly Higher Than Last Year; Yesterday's Market Saw All Goods Rise With Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the labor unrest in the cotton cloth market has largely subsided, the demand for yarn is strong and prices are rising. Speculative yarn for all months is also rising uniformly. The current stock of cotton cloth is depleted, and the market is still calling for goods. Due to the high cost of raw materials and yarn, few goods are being held back. Yesterday, cotton merchants were firm, and out-of-town buyers were still actively purchasing, especially for goods destined for southern routes, Sichuan, Yunnan, Changsha, Hankou, Jiujiang, Dagukou, and Wuhu, which are considered good destinations. Sales in Ningbo, Shaoxing, and this street are also brisk. Transactions are mostly for white goods, lightweight coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Money crepe and flannel are also selling surprisingly well. Although the sales of printed flannel are still good, prices remain sluggish, with hand-made goods being sold at a discount of five to one fen per yard compared to factory prices. Recently, spring goods such as pongee and bleached cloth have been attracting inquiries from flat street vendors and dyeing factories. However, due to the high price of yarn, weaving factories would need to increase the price of pongee by five to six fen per yard and bleached/striped cloth by more than one yuan per piece compared to last year's prices, causing many to remain hesitant. This year, due to very good sales, factories have very little pongee left. A few factories have already opened their prices, which are said to be five fen per yard higher than before.</p>
<h3>Woolen Goods Prices Rising Endlessly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trade in woolen goods was strong, and the trend was bullish. Both out-of-town buyers and local merchants were purchasing. Trading houses have dispatched considerable amounts of seasonal winter goods. Shipments from Pudong and Puxi have been quite congested in recent days. However, those holding the goods are extremely cautious about extending credit, especially to out-of-town buyers. The prices of woolen goods in the guild have been rising endlessly in about 70% to 80% of cases. Those holding the goods are generally optimistic, and the gradual increase in prices is rare in recent years.</p>
<h3>Finance: Although There Was Outside Buying, Speculative Gold, After Being Bullish, Was Still Weak; Sellers Profited From the High Prices, Resulting in a Fall of Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with pure gold holding steady, the gold market saw strong buying interest, including from outside the industry, which briefly boosted the market. Major sellers profited from the high prices, resulting in a decline. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw London rising and the US remaining unchanged. Forward silver prices in Montevideo rose by five and a half to seven li. Exchange rates rose slightly. London spot gold was unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates showed both English and American rates unchanged. The Customs Gold Unit was unchanged. The posted price for standard speculative gold remained 1156.1 yuan. Pre-market trading outside the exchange opened at around 56 yuan. Fuxing Yong sold, while Hongchang Yong, Dadecheng, and Laijin bought, pushing the price up to over 6.5 yuan. The market opened high, and buyers continued to exert pressure, with suppliers remaining cautious, briefly boosting the market. Later, major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing a gradual decline. HSBC's posted rates showed both English and American rates unchanged and then gradually falling. The silver balancing tax rose by 1.125 fen. Although there was a rebound, buyers gradually thinned out, and major short sellers were active. The market weakened by midday. Later trading was sparse, with the market initially steady but then weakening, largely due to major players becoming more willing to sell. Yesterday's swaps saw the bulls posting 1.65 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

December's bookkeeping was 1154 yuan, and January's was 1156 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 1153 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were priced at a premium of 12 yuan, and "cooked red" was priced at a premium of 9 yuan, but there were few sellers. "Cooked red" was priced at a premium of 14 yuan, with a small amount sold by Tongfeng Heng. Yesterday's swaps saw Shengyuan Yong posting 105 lots to Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong 35 lots, Yiyu 21 lots, and Chunyuan Yong Dadecheng 14 lots, all at 1.65 yuan. In the afternoon, Shengyuan Yong posted 154 lots to Run Changyu at the same price, and Jiuda 7 lots at 1.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading within the exchange was mediocre. In total, Hongchang Yong, Shengyuan Yong, Yi Da, Dadecheng, Shen Da Yong, Yongde, Yuanmao Yong, etc., were on the buying side, while Jinfeng Yong, Qingfa Yong, Qiafeng Yong, Hengyu, Fuxing Yong, Qianchang Xiang, Wan Yu, etc., were on the selling side.

The morning opening was 1156.6 yuan, the highest was 1157.8 yuan, and the lowest and closing were both 1155.6 yuan, a difference of 2.2 yuan. The result was a decline of 3 jiao compared to last Saturday. 2310 December contracts have not yet been swapped, with a total of four bulls and twenty-three bears. January futures contracts totaled 4998, with a total of thirty-three bulls and twenty-four bears. The total number of contracts traded was 966 in the morning and 231 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Are Again Closing Sterling Positions</h3>

It was observed that in the morning, overseas telegrams showed that London large bars rose by 1875 for both near and far contracts, the New York silver market was unchanged, forward silver prices in Montevideo rose by five and a half to seven li, London spot gold was unchanged, English to American was unchanged, English to French fell by three pounds, American to English rose by 0.125, and American to French rose by 0.0625.

After the opening, banks sold some, while Sin Feng Foreign Firm swapped some. HSBC's posted rates showed both English and American rates unchanged. Although it loosened, it was still steady. The silver balancing tax rose by 1.125 fen. Foreign firms closed near-term sterling positions, and banks were happy to trade against them. The situation remained steady, but the American dollar showed signs of holding. Later, Chinese merchants slightly bought sterling, while banks sold far and bought near, and also engaged in exchange rate transactions. As a result, the overall trend was to fluctuate. Indian silver initially rose by 2.3 anna and then fell back by 4 anna, with little significant impact.

<h3>Securities: Only One Market Day Remaining in This Month; Public Bond Swap Transactions Very Frequent; Market Price Changed From Weak To Firm…Mixed Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the public bond market, because it was the last two days of futures trading for this month, swap transactions were extremely mixed. The trend changed from weak to firm and bullish. Initially, due to unfavorable news about the situation, the market felt increasingly weak and sluggish. The selling sentiment on the floor was strong, and market prices gradually declined. However, later, short sellers eagerly swapped positions, and many retail investors also covered their short positions, causing the market to rebound. Today is the last day of November futures trading. In this unsettling environment, both bulls and bears are still engaging in significant competition. However, based on the trend on the floor, there is a risk of a short squeeze. Yesterday morning, the market opened with the news of the intense fighting in the Sui region causing panic. Major players such as 47 and 14 were selling heavily, and retail investors followed suit. The supply on the floor was overwhelming, and market prices uniformly declined by 2 to 4.5 jiao. In the second session, the market slightly rebounded. Swap transactions were very active, and major players such as 4 and 10 swapped even more. Except for minimal declines of 1 to 2 jiao in Series C, D, and B for this month, the rest improved by 0.5 to 2.5 jiao. In the afternoon, the trend continued to strengthen. 16 and 35 were buying significantly, and 11, 50, and 43 were also very actively swapping. Series E near-term surged by 5 jiao, and Series A, D, etc., also improved by 1 to 2.5 jiao. Closing trading still involved many swaps. 11 and 6 continued to swap, and 16 bought quite a bit. Market prices continued to rise by about 1 jiao. Only Series E for this month declined slightly by 0.5 jiao. The overall result for the day was a slight decline of 0.5 to 1.5 jiao, but Series E near-term and Series A showed signs of a short squeeze, improving by 0.5 to 3.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was 10,805,000 yuan. A comparison of the rise, fall, high, and low is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grains: Wheat Supply Not Smooth; Flour Market Feels Particularly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, all months showed a uniform upward trend. The quotation for foreign wheat saw Chicago near-term up 2 jiao, far-term down 0.4 jiao, and Canada down about 1 jiao. At the opening, sentiment for this month was initially calm, but starting with February, sentiment gradually became active because the combined price of current foreign wheat never broke, and the arrival of domestic wheat was impeded due to blockades everywhere. As a result, both internal and external thinking turned bullish. Buying interest also gradually became brisk, increasing by 1 to 2 fen compared to the previous week's closing price. Until the afternoon opening, this month initially saw a short-covering rally, reaching a high of 3.83 yuan. Trading for December and beyond was very brisk. Due to minor selling by major players, the market stabilized. After the second session, sentiment calmed down, falling slightly below the initial opening. After that, the trend was to fluctuate, with not much movement. Those in the industry speculated that with the arrival of wheat gradually decreasing, there would be a shortage of raw materials, so the subsequent trend should be long-term stability.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Affordable; Speculative Wheat Market More Moderate</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the speculative wheat market, after the morning opening, all months were uniformly stable and firm. Because the arrival of wheat is currently temporarily blocked, the combined price of current foreign wheat has ultimately failed to approach. Because rice prices are affordable, sentiment has been held down, so although the market is good, the upward trend is not very strong. The opening prices for all months were 3 to 5 fen better than the previous week. Until the afternoon opening, the market was still firm, improving by another 2 fen compared to the morning. However, because the flour market slightly loosened, bulls sold positions, showing slight weakness. However, in terms of the environment, there is a trend that it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. The current wheat market remains stable. However, the current arrival of goods is low, and out-of-town buyers are inevitably hoarding, opening Mingguang wheat at 6.1 yuan, Yuzhou wheat at 6.06 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 6 yuan, and Wuhu wheat at 6.01 yuan. The whole city only opened 3000-4000 bags.</p>
<h3>Early Rice Out-Of-Town Buyers Purchase Over Ten Thousand Bags – Arrival Also Extremely Congested</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from all areas suddenly flooded in, totaling over a hundred firms with a total of over 21,000 shi of goods. Early rice still accounted for the majority. In terms of sales, the street was normal, but there were many outlets for Baozi rice. Out-of-town buyers purchased over 10,000 bags of early rice and over 500 bags of thick glutinous rice. Therefore, the final market situation was stable, with little change in price. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan also saw no rise or fall.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over forty firms from all areas downstream. The market saw sluggish sales of all kinds of goods. The price of new glutinous rice was down slightly by 5 to 6 fen. Early rice was flat and weak. Early rice sales were brisk. The street was clear and relaxed. High-quality goods were stable. Medium-quality goods were slightly weak. Yang Dujian was also weak. Bian Yuan wine customers were inactive, with sporadic light trading, with a price decline of 0.1 yuan. Out-of-town Jian had limited appetite, and prices were peaceful.</p>
<h3>Out-Of-Town Xian Rice Sales Suddenly Booming Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of out-of-town xian rice became brisk, and the sellers were showing many samples. With ample arrivals and existing stocks, and also many goods on the way, the market failed to rally significantly. However, with a sudden surge in sales to Guangdong, sentiment turned bullish. Henan and Shantou buyers also resumed smooth procedures for rice. The street was also active, especially with the smooth buying of rough xian rice for Guangzhou, totaling 7000-8000 bags of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shahe, and Hankou rice. The rough rice market was even more active. Although the market situation was similar to the previous market, the middle and high-quality goods were pulling the market, and prices had already quietly risen by several fen. For the whole day, 5262 bags of Jiangxi rice, 200 bags of Ningbo-Taiwan rice, 3330 bags of Hunan rice, and 3000 bags of Hankou rough rice were sold.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Rare in Twenty Years, Tallow Oil Dealers Actively</h3>
<p>Tallow oil foreign trade, from the present, twenty years ago, during the early Republic of China period, around 1915-1916, during the European War, in the era of the old Russian Empire, they procured huge quantities from our country. Since then, only Dongyang Zhuang has slightly exported some each year, but the quantities are extremely small, having almost no impact on the market. But this time, just at the time of metabolism, European and American foreign firms are widely purchasing in Hankou and Yichang, etc., for delivery in December and January, with a total of 700-800 tons of transactions. This massive export business has not occurred in twenty years. This sudden event has surprised all those engaged in this business, and the market has suddenly jumped by 2-3 yuan. Moreover, new goods have not flourished in the Hankou market, and old oil has been exhausted, creating a stormy scenario in the market. The prices at which manufacturers are selling to foreign firms are kept secret and cannot be investigated. According to various foreign firms in this port, they have also begun purchasing, but not in the huge quantities of the Hankou market. The production areas are at the peak of output. If only for domestic sales, there would certainly be a surplus. If they also want to supply foreign firms, there may be a shortage. Therefore, whether the market can rise again depends on the continued purchasing of foreign firms and ourselves. Currently, all the oil firms in this city have no inventory. Demand is about to move, and goods are not arriving, resulting in a severe shortage of oil. It is estimated that the selling price of Wumu Chongjing must be above 24 yuan per dan, and Macheng oil must also be around 22 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>A Call for the Health of Children in Rural and Township Elementary Schools Nationwide (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yuheng</p>
<p>4. The School Hygiene Needs of Rural and Township Elementary Schools in China Today</p>
<p>School hygiene is the guarantee of children's health and the tool to promote physical soundness. Whether it is urban or rural elementary schools, it is equally needed. Urban schools and students have more facilities to help guarantee health due to the environment of material civilization. All aspects are much more convenient than rural schools and students. According to the statistics of the Health Department, more than 90% of students in urban elementary schools are unhealthy. There are no hospitals and health agencies as perfect as those in urban areas in rural towns, and there are not that many medical personnel. It can be simply said that there are none in rural areas. School teachers only know how to teach. No one cares about children's health problems. The call for universal school hygiene facilities to seek happiness for children only stays in a few cities. Children's Year has passed, and the Children's Welfare Committee has been abolished. Children in rural areas and urban children spend Children's Year in the same way, but they experience two different scenarios. Urban children have been given many happy careers by Children's Year. Children in rural areas still live the same impoverished and sick life. They are not disappointed. They are still desiring the mercy of powerful administrative officials to seek some happiness for them with political power, especially the urgent health problems.</p>
<p>School hygiene in urban areas is easier to implement because of the assistance of environmental aspects. At the same time, the experts, doctors, and nurses are influenced by material civilization and bathed in Western culture. They admire the prosperity of cities, and at the same time, cities can give them the needs of their own desires anytime and anywhere, so they all live in cities. Therefore, school hygiene facilities in urban areas are much easier than in rural towns. In terms of talent, specialized talents are nostalgic for the city, which does not affect the school hygiene facilities in rural towns. The school hygiene facilities in rural towns in China today do not need those talents who admire urban life and admire Westernization. They can not only adapt to rural work but also easily infect the students in rural towns, making the students uneasy in the countryside and incompetent in the city, which in turn affects education. A certain city elementary school once asked the author to hire a school health nurse for them. The author believed that this type of talent must have received specialized training to be able to take office, so they wanted to introduce a nurse who had received public health training and discussed it with the school. The school rejected it because they had hired a person with the same qualifications before and found that they did not meet the needs. The reason was that the health work they did in the school failed to participate in the national conditions and implemented it. They completely implemented a set of Western-style health formulas there. Public opinion arose in the society, and they could not get through everywhere. Moreover, they did not consider the school's economy and the improvement of the environment, and did not start with trying to improve it with a small amount of economy to make it in line with hygiene principles, but instead took the principle of demolishing and rebuilding. No wonder the school rejected my introduction of this type of qualified talent when they saw it? This type of health talent cannot even be accommodated in the city. How can they serve the countryside? Once the hygiene of rural and township elementary schools is actively promoted and implemented, public health nurses will inevitably be needed to assist in the work. It is asked how many training institutions in the country can provide this type of talent suitable for rural work. No wonder people say, "Rural hygiene is very important, but it is difficult to train talents. A rural health worker is much stronger than an urban one, and their position is much higher."</p>
<p>Implementing hygiene in rural and township elementary schools is not only a difficult task to hire talents, but also the economy of school hygiene is a very big problem. Specialized talents cannot be hired. At the very least, there must be a public health nurse who can serve as the instructor for several schools' hygiene. Each province should open large-scale rural and township elementary schools, school hygiene training classes, and train the current rural and township elementary school teachers. Anyone who has done school hygiene feels that school hygiene must be handled automatically by teachers. Not only can it save money, but it can also increase work efficiency. How can we train teachers to meet the needs of hygiene in rural and township elementary schools? It all depends on the experience and talent of the trainers. The hygiene expenses of elementary schools in rural and township areas should try to avoid collecting from students as much as possible. The hygiene fee of five or six yuan per semester is enough. The school hygiene facilities focus entirely on health education and health care work. The improvement of the school environment can use the activities of teachers and students. In short, when training, pay attention to "being suitable for the rural environment." Do not teach the rural teachers European and American or Japanese-style hygiene that does not conform to Chinese rural towns, otherwise, not only is there no way to deal with the economy, but it is also a waste of training. If the school cannot even afford a medicine cabinet, the education administration should find a way to subsidize it.</p>
<p>5. Promoting Political Power</p>
<p>The implementation of school hygiene facilities in rural and township elementary schools is directly and indirectly very important for China's revival. How can we find a way to achieve it in the shortest possible time? It all depends on the promotion of political power. As long as the government takes this matter seriously, establishes the direction of implementation, and strictly implements it with political power, children in rural and township elementary schools across the country can soon get health guarantees.</p>
<p>It is found that the Ministry of Education has already promulgated the school hygiene facility program. Due to the lack of talent, most places have not followed it. From this point of view, we are requesting the education authorities for the children of rural and township elementary schools across the country to first add rural and township elementary school hygiene training classes in each province and train a large number of incumbent teachers in rural and township elementary schools. The Ministry of Education should set up commissioners to manage this matter. The education departments of each province should have this director of the establishment, and also the responsibility of supervision. The county education bureaus should also have the director of the establishment. The observation and inspection of school hygiene should be as important as school administration and teaching. In this way, the implementation of school hygiene facilities will be supervised, and it will not be allowed to be neglected or spread out for a long time without being realized.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion</p>
<p>From today's rural hygiene work, there are too few who truly seek health guarantees for children in rural and township elementary schools. China is now in such a serious time, and revival work is so important. We must not only care about the health problems of urban children and ignore the health problems of the majority of children in rural and township elementary schools. Ignoring the health of children in rural and township elementary schools is also equivalent to ignoring the work of reviving China.</p>
<p>The number of people calling for the health of children in rural and township elementary schools is increasing, which is enough to show the importance of this issue. If we rely on rural hygiene to promote it, this snail-like walk is not suitable for survival in today's era. The current hygiene in rural and township elementary schools needs to be realized universally in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Training rural and township elementary school teachers to serve in school hygiene work is not only in line with the national conditions, but also can increase work efficiency.</p>
<p>Administrative officials! Experts! Gentlemen of the Children's Affairs Committee! Please find a solution to the health problems of children in rural and township elementary schools.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Building the Nursing Profession in China Tomorrow (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>As we promote the development of medical and health endeavors in China, it would be a grave error to focus solely on the expansion of medicine and pharmaceuticals while neglecting the integrated promotion of nursing and midwifery. In recent years, disputes often arise between the public and the new medical community, leading to litigation. This is partly due to the public's lack of understanding of medical and pharmaceutical principles and insufficient knowledge of medical and health hygiene. However, conflicts also arise significantly due to poor nursing skills and a lack of humility in nursing attitudes. Therefore, advocating for the nursing profession and reforming nursing education are as important and closely related as reforming medical education. I will now briefly discuss the issue of building the nursing profession in China tomorrow.</p>
<p>First, the independence of nursing schools is a fundamental principle.</p>
<p>Nursing schools are the place for educating nursing talent. Only with excellent and well-equipped facilities can talent be trained and ideal nurses be produced. Undoubtedly, nursing schools must first be independent. With the independence of nursing schools, all administrative authority over nursing and the promotion of the nursing profession can be established on a solid foundation. With a foundation as solid as iron and stone, the nursing profession can gradually engage in social advocacy, making society aware of the significance and importance of the nursing profession. Then, the future of the nursing profession will have hope for progress.</p>
<p>Many nursing schools in China appear to be independent on the surface, but in reality, they are not. All authority within the schools remains under the control of hospitals. At this stage, we cannot resolutely overturn the existing situation because it is a sign of the transitional period for nursing schools and a process of their evolution. However, we cannot allow them to remain perpetually in this transitional era. At least, there must be a final limit, and we must seek the era of independence for our nursing schools, reaching the ideal generation we envision.</p>
<p>That generation of ideal nurses, the engine of this great mission, is entirely dependent on the Nursing Education Committee, which bears the highest administrative authority over nursing in China. Efforts must be made to persuade the highest educational administrative authority in China—the Ministry of Education—to recognize the nursing profession as an important form of vocational education. It should issue orders to each province and city to establish at least one nursing school, on par with specialized vocational schools, to cultivate nursing talent and promote the development of the nursing profession. If this construction is successful, all provinces and cities in China will have established nursing schools, and even remote areas can enjoy the services of the nursing profession, benefiting patients. When the nursing profession achieves widespread socialization, then the future of the nursing profession will have a strong grip and a bright future.</p>
<p>Second, the construction of the nursing education system is the catalyst for reform.</p>
<p>Every profession is a product of society. Why are some professions considered noble and respected, while others are seen as lowly and inferior? This can be attributed to the distinctions created by thought and knowledge, which lead to class differences. For example, civil engineers and carpenters both engage in similar work with a common goal, yet civil engineers enjoy a significantly higher social status. Carpenters, who also work on civil engineering projects, are often regarded as having a lower social standing. The clear answer is that civil engineers have received rigorous knowledge transfer and extensive training, while carpenters blindly follow procedures without understanding the underlying principles. Therefore, the status of a profession is entirely determined by intellectual capacity and the level of education, dictating the fate of the profession. We cannot deny this and must instead encourage the newly emerging nursing profession to be vigilant.</p>
<p>We know that the training of any profession encompasses several stages. For example, graduates of senior high school normal schools can further their studies at university normal schools or colleges of education, pursuing advanced research in education.</p>
<p>However, when we look at the nursing education system, graduates of advanced nursing vocational schools have no opportunities for further study. This is the final destination for nurses seeking knowledge, a dead end where they spend their lives.</p>
<p>At the same time, nursing instructors in nursing schools have not received adequate teacher training and lack practical teaching skills. The knowledge imparted to nursing students and their nursing skills are vague and unable to meet the actual needs of clinical nursing and alleviate the suffering of patients. So, where will we produce specialized nursing teachers and train talent to inspect nurses?</p>

<h3>Common Sense on Hygiene for Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(108) Cornea</p>
<p>The cornea is commonly known as the "black of the eye." It is a transparent membrane that forms the front part of the eyeball. It is shaped like a horizontal ellipse, curved forward to form part of the eye's surface. Its diameter is 10 millimeters, its transverse diameter is 11 millimeters, and its thickness is 1 millimeter. The structure of the cornea can be divided into five layers: the epithelial cell layer (composed of brick-like epithelial cells), the anterior basement membrane (or Bowman's membrane, a thin, structureless transparent membrane), the corneal stroma (the substance layer, composed of very fine connective tissue fibers), the posterior basement membrane (or Descemet's membrane, a structureless elastic membrane), and the endothelium (composed of larger, flat cells). The surface of the cornea is constantly moistened by tears, so it remains smooth, facilitating the entry and refraction of light. In its normal physiological state, the cornea's surface is smooth. However, if a pathological change occurs, it becomes rough. The degree of roughness varies, sometimes subtle and sometimes significant, depending on the condition. If the cornea suffers from inflammation or degenerative changes, it will become cloudy. Whether the cloudiness is fresh or old, located in the central or marginal region, deep or superficial, whether there is tissue loss, and whether it appears grayish-white or yellowish, are all closely related to the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Most notably, fresh cloudiness is usually accompanied by irritation symptoms. Patients experience photophobia, tearing, and pain. At the same time, corneal congestion, conjunctival edema, and hypopyon may occur.</p>
<p>(109) Keratitis</p>
<p>There are many types of keratitis, and its condition is quite complex. Corneal congestion is its only major symptom, occurring in the early stages of inflammation. When the inflammation is severe, the sclera, iris, and conjunctiva are also often congested. Other major symptoms of keratitis include corneal cloudiness, neovascularization, corneal ulcer, and hypopyon. I will now briefly describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Corneal Cloudiness - Corneal cloudiness is a necessary symptom of keratitis, caused by cell infiltration. The degree of cloudiness varies depending on the type of inflammation and the severity of the condition. It may appear like a mist, dots, or patches. Clinically, cloudiness can be divided into three types: thin and translucent cloudiness is called corneal nebula, slightly thicker and grayish-white cloudiness is called corneal macula, and thick and white cloudiness is called corneal leukoma.</p>
<p>(2) Neovascularization - In superficial keratitis, neovascularization often originates from the conjunctiva and is distributed on the surface of the cornea, often in a dendritic pattern. In deep keratitis, neovascularization often originates from the sclera and uvea and is distributed in the deeper layers, often in a brush-like or broom-like pattern.</p>
<p>(3) Corneal Ulcer - When corneal inflammation is severe, the tissue often breaks down, and the surface develops tissue loss, which is called a corneal ulcer.</p>
<p>(4) Hypopyon - In suppurative keratitis with ulceration, there is often hypopyon in the anterior chamber. The pus appears yellowish-white and settles at the bottom of the anterior chamber in a crescent shape, forming a horizontal plane above.</p>
<p>The patient's subjective symptoms include photophobia, tearing, foreign body sensation, burning sensation, pain, and visual impairment.</p>
<p>(110) Why does the amount of nasal secretions increase?</p>
<p>Nasal secretions are commonly known as nasal mucus. In a healthy and disease-free nasal cavity, the amount of secretions is normal. They do not flow out of the nostrils or down into the nasopharynx. However, if the nasal cavity suffers from acute or chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, or nasal foreign bodies, the amount of nasal secretions can suddenly increase, either flowing out of the nostrils or down into the nasopharynx. The nature and quantity of nasal secretions vary depending on the pathogen, the condition, and the stage of the disease. I will now describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the early stages of acute rhinitis (commonly known as the common cold), the nasal mucosa is dry, but soon a large amount of serous nasal fluid flows. After a certain period of time, it becomes viscous, and finally, it becomes purulent and the amount decreases significantly.</p>
<p>(2) The secretions of sinusitis vary in nature. They can be serous, mucous, or purulent. Secretions from the anterior sinuses (maxillary sinus, frontal sinus, and anterior ethmoid air cells) mostly flow into the middle nasal meatus. Secretions from the posterior sinuses (sphenoid sinus and posterior ethmoid air cells) mostly flow into the olfactory cleft or down into the nasopharynx.</p>
<p>(3) Vasomotor Rhinitis - This is a nervous disorder that occurs in episodes. Only during an episode does it secrete a large amount of serous nasal fluid. Medically, it is called watery rhinorrhea. If a foreign body is present in the nasal cavity, the foreign body will first stimulate the secretion of mucus, followed by purulent secretions. It often has a foul odor.</p>

<h3>After Participating in the Smallpox Vaccination Campaign in the Shantytowns of the Jiangsu Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>— Yin Baishui</p>
<p>I remember in the early summer of this year, there was a great commotion about this year being a "cholera year," and it was loudly proclaimed that it was particularly prevalent in the Yangtze River basin, causing widespread panic. Various health agencies were also very busy, because cholera is indeed too fierce and brutal when it breaks out. In the Jiangsu provincial capital, the provincial health bureau used all its energy to publicize and jointly with various health agencies to carry out expanded preventive injections, and the result can be considered a victory. The hot summer has long passed, and no bad news of cholera outbreaks has been heard. This must be attributed to the efforts of prevention and the value of prevention. Although autumn is not as "dreadful as summer," the outbreak of malignant malaria this autumn has threatened everyone with fear and trepidation. Now autumn has left the world, and everyone can breathe a deep sigh of relief. The coming winter and spring are generally considered to be peaceful days, but don't forget! Smallpox is already secretly and rapidly breeding and flourishing, and will be drawing its lines and starting its attack on mankind. If we do not catch up and prevent it—by vaccinating—its brutal tricks will not only make you an ugly pockmarked face, but also endanger your life. Looking at the facts of the past, each outbreak of smallpox has harmed countless promising children! On the national level, it has lost enormous vitality, and on the family level, it has lost its only lifeline. The Jiangsu Provincial Health Bureau had already seen this point, and in order to prevent problems before they occur, in addition to the special free vaccination in major hospitals and clinics, it also invited all the students of the Zhenjiang Rural Nursing School on November 8, divided into ten teams, each led by a health police officer, to the designated shantytowns in twenty areas to do vaccination work, while doing publicity work. However, because the people's knowledge is ignorant, their thinking is stubborn, and their health education is lacking, there are many difficulties. I would like to borrow a corner of this publication to publish it, hoping that the health authorities will study together to find a solution, and at the same time write down the心得after this vaccination to give to everyone, so that it may be of assistance in the future.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the work</p>
<p>(1) Because the weather is cold, people are unwilling to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>(2) They believe that one vaccination of earth pox (old-fashioned vaccination) can prevent it for life, while vaccination of foreign pox (cowpox) cannot. This misconception exists, so those who have been vaccinated with the old-fashioned method are unwilling to be vaccinated a second time, and those who have not been vaccinated ask for old-fashioned Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>(3) They believe that vaccination can cure diseases. If you say that it can only prevent smallpox and cannot cure diseases, they are unwilling to be vaccinated. If you want to comply with their psychology, you should say that it can cure diseases, which would violate health education. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Map Drawing Competition</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The YMCA held a map drawing competition yesterday. It is said that there are two ways to compete. One is to select one or several provinces in the country and draw a map of (1) those that occupy an important position in the national economy; (2) those that occupy an important relationship in national defense; (3) those with fertile land, suitable for immigration; (4) those with significant development potential in the future; (5) those with abundant products and many exports. The other is to select one or several provinces and draw a map of (1) rivers; (2) mountain ranges; (3) important place names; (4) important railways and waterways; (5) important products; (6) important commercial ports. As for the evaluation criteria, they will be based on accuracy, importance, neatness, completeness, and usefulness.</p>
<p>This is a very meaningful and interesting competition. Saying it is meaningful, I think this does not need me to explain, readers will nod their heads in agreement; saying it is interesting, then I think as long as people who really feel the joy of working will definitely be able to experience it. To give an example, you might as well take the exam in school as an example. In school, if you do particularly well in a certain subject, when you are taking the exam, and after the exam, your mental pleasure is really indescribable. It not only compensates for your hard work buried in your desk, but at that time, you even think of the situation when you were diligently buried in your desk, and that hard work will also turn into pleasure.</p>
<p>But the map drawing competition is not like a school exam. Even if you are the best "top student" in the school exam, it does not mean that you like every subject, but in order to "graduate" or "upgrade", you have to accept the "cramming" homework, so the result is that the exam is not only not liked by you, but sometimes it makes you feel afraid, so the exam that could have encouraged you to compete upwards is also avoided because of fear and disgust.</p>
<p>The greater benefit of the map drawing competition, of course, lies in its meaning, just as its origin says; "...If we broaden our horizons and say that the country is our big family, who would say it is not appropriate. We should know the property and things in the family like the back of our hand. If we cannot know the details, we will lose the basis for survival, and the people of the country, in this situation of surrounded by dangers, if they know nothing about the geographical situation, mountains and rivers, transportation and products, is it not different from the fact that although we have a family, we cannot know in detail how many properties there are. The great rivers and mountains will eventually be lost...".</p>
<p>However, we would like to raise a memorandum here, that is, competitions like map drawing must be made to achieve both universality and depth, especially the universality aspect, which should be started immediately, even if it is not possible to immediately make the national public aware of the general situation of the country, but the transportation, production, and relationship with the country of the "first line of national defense" provinces should be made clear to them in a general sense. Of course, the method does not have to be drawing maps, it can be conveyed in words or in writing.</p>
<h3>A Visit to a Glass Factory</h3>
<p>— Xishan</p>
<p>(Special Feature of This Newspaper) Glass has many uses, whether in daily utensils or in medical and chemical products, it cannot be lacking, so this is a very important industry. In recent years, although the manufacture of glass in our country has been very developed, the products are still not perfect, and the production of fine and expensive products is still sluggish, so the import of foreign glass products still reaches about 6.7 million yuan every year.</p>
<p>There are more than 120 factories in the country that manufacture glass, distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, Shandong and other provinces, among which Shanghai is the most numerous. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 36 large and small glass manufacturing factories in the city, with a total capital of more than one million yuan, and the annual output is about four million yuan, ranking first in various places. In order to understand some of the glass manufacturing situation, I recently went to the Jinghua Glass Factory on Bailinan Road to visit.</p>
<p>Jinghua Factory is one of the larger glass manufacturing factories in the city, so the equipment is also very complete, and the main products are bottle shells, water cups, basins, lampshades, etc. The main raw materials are sea sand and alkali powder, etc. Most of these raw materials are domestic products. Sea sand is transported from Putuo and Zhenhai in Zhejiang; alkali powder is supplied by China Yongli Alkali Factory. Because of the good raw materials, the products are still excellent, and the average monthly output is about 120,000 yuan, ranking first among the same industry in the city.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process of glass, from raw materials to finished products, is divided into five steps:</p>
<p>(1) Raw Material Preparation: The first step in glass manufacturing is the preparation of raw materials. Because the sea sand contains a lot of moisture when it is transported, it must first be placed in a baking oven to dry it. After all the moisture is extracted, it is put into a grinding disc to grind it into extremely fine powder, and then it is mixed with alkali powder and other raw materials to dissolve into the same ingredient before being put into a steam furnace for smelting.</p>
<p>(2) Smelting: The next step after the preparation of materials is smelting. The factory has three steam furnaces, the largest of which is the bottle shell manufacturing furnace. It is made of fire bricks around the ten zhang square, and coated with cement and gelatinous sand, etc., because the temperature inside the furnace is extremely high, usually around 1800 degrees, so that it will not explode. There is a hopper at the top of the furnace, and the prepared raw material powder is poured in from the hopper. After a suitable smelting time, the powder becomes a fiery red liquid material, so it can start to be molded.</p>
<p>(3) Molding: The molding machine is connected to the outlet hopper of the smelting furnace. It can work fully automatically during manufacturing. The model of the object to be manufactured is first installed around the machine. When molding starts, the outlet hopper of the smelting furnace is opened, so that the molten liquid material is poured into each model separately. After the model is poured into a certain volume of raw material liquid, the mold shell automatically rotates upward and tilts, so that the liquid in the mold is evenly distributed to each other. After the model is complete, the mold shell automatically separates, and the formed utensils are rolled out of the machine in rows. It is said that molding with this machine is very fast, and 20 can be formed per minute, and 30,000 can be produced continuously every day.</p>
<p>(4) Finished Products: After the glass utensils are formed and taken out, their temperature is extremely high. If they are placed in air with uneven temperature, they will easily break, so after molding, they must be placed in a baking oven with gradually decreasing temperature to gradually reduce their heat. The area of this baking oven is 4 zhang long and 6 feet high. The temperature inside the oven is not equal from the entrance to the exit, and it is locally reduced. The initial shape is placed at the highest point of the cooked temperature, and is slowly moved until it reaches the exit, which is equal to the temperature outside the oven, so the shape can be finished.</p>
<p>(5) Finishing: After the utensils are finished, there will inevitably be some that are not neat, so they must be subjected to a finishing process, and check whether their composition is clear, whether the weight is balanced, and whether the model is correct, etc. Those that do not meet the standards are then beaten into powder and placed in the smelting furnace for re-smelting.</p>
<p>In terms of product sales, it is said that the summer of each year is relatively light, and then the production and sales situation are good. However, most products, such as glass plates and lampshades, cannot compete with imported products in the market because the manufacturing is not exquisite.</p>
<h3>Bird Raising</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>I happened to see a hibiscus bird at a friend's house, which reminded me of my childhood: after returning home yesterday, I spent almost the entire night dreaming about raising birds.</p>
<p>Raising birds occupied a very important part of my childhood, because I loved raising birds in my hometown. Although I was often scolded by my mother for it, I was not discouraged. Every morning or evening, as long as my mother wasn't watching, my younger brother and I would secretly take a "trap cage" to the front of the Yuwang Temple, hang it on a large persimmon tree, and quietly hide in a cypress tree tomb, blowing a whistle commonly used by bird catchers, waiting for wild birds to enter the cage.</p>
<p>"Trap cage" is a sharp tool for catching birds, also made of bamboo strips: square in shape, with two trap doors on top and six trigger doors below. In the center of the cage is a decoy cage. When catching birds, first put a female bird in the decoy cage, and then insert a red object, like cherries or pomegranate seeds, on the trigger of each door. This allows it to be hung on trees in the countryside, letting the female bird call and jump in the cage. When wild birds fly over, they see their own kind calling and see these lovely red cherries, so they happily land on the cage. But without realizing it, the trigger flips, and they fall into the cage helplessly—in fact, they have been tricked; these red cherries are made of stone or evergreen seeds.</p>
<p>We hung the "trap cage" high in the tree, while we held our breath and squatted in the cypress tree tomb to watch. Strangely enough, our whistle was very effective. As long as we blew a few times, a large flock of birds would fly over every time, hopping and calling on the nearby pomegranate trees, mulberry trees, and the large persimmon tree, very lively and happy, as if looking for their friends. At that time, our hearts were tense, hoping they would quickly jump onto the "trap cage" and fall into the trap.</p>
<p>Newly captured birds, because they are not used to the cage, always thrash about in the cage without eating or calling, trying to break through the barriers and escape. At that time, we must wrap the cage in black cloth to prevent them from seeing the light, otherwise they will definitely jump to their deaths. However, after three or four days, once they get used to it, they will settle into this life.</p>
<p>New birds are not used to life in a cage, so all captured birds must first be placed in the same cage with old birds. After a certain period of time, they can be separated. However, we bird raisers are all sexist, because female birds are not good at calling. Except for being used as decoys and for teaching to eat, they are useless. Moreover, generally speaking, females of all animals are more beautiful than males, but birds are just the opposite. Males are lively and beautiful, exquisite and lovely, and they can sing, while females can only lay eggs and hatch, and they look bloated and ugly, and their calls are not very pleasant to hear. We only need to look at chickens to prove that my argument is not nonsense.</p>
<p>I have considerable experience in raising birds. I can distinguish the quality of bird species and know how to prevent bird diseases: perching sideways, tilting the head, jumping to the bottom of the cage, and a hoarse voice indicate inferior birds; a slender body, refined eyes, tight feathers, and a clear voice indicate superior species. But I love raising white-eyes; I don't like mynas or Chinese bulbuls, because white-eyes love cleanliness and are elegant, unlike mynas that are noisy, or Chinese bulbuls that are filthy.</p>
<p>Every day, besides going to school, I spend all my spare time raising birds. In the morning, I take them for walks in the wild; in the afternoon, I bathe them and change their cages, which makes me very happy. My younger brother, although he doesn't understand, likes to watch me do it. My mother and the others are not against me raising them, but are just afraid of "sin."</p>
<p>Every spring, I am even happier. The birds in the forest outside are calling, and the birds in our cage also happily sing mountain songs, one singing and one responding, which is really nice to hear.</p>
<p>But, an accident finally happened. One day, after I had gone to school, the white-eye I loved the most, which I had raised for five years, was stolen by someone. Even now, I still think about it from time to time—</p>

<h3>Early Winter Sketches</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>(1) Camel Bells</p>
<p>In the early morning, before dawn, some yellow, massive creatures set out in the early cold with their masters. One following another, silently striding with heavy steps, carrying hundreds of pounds of burden on their backs: coal, lime, charcoal, persimmons... In addition to these, there were also dry grass in large cloth bags and steamed buns in small cloth bags, which were the food for the animals themselves and their masters. After walking a long distance, both the camels and the people were hungry. They would stop silently, their furry legs lightly shaking off the dust, their front knees slowly kneeling down, their bellies touching the ground. When the master put the fodder in front of them, their thick lips would begin to move, their mouths almost touching the edge of the basket, and their heavy eyes would turn to the sky.</p>
<p>The bells under their necks jingled softly. Besides the camels' chewing and the choking coughs of the camel driver swallowing food, this crisp sound was the only melody. This tone gently reverberated, spreading out like ripples on the water, entertaining the animals themselves and the weathered camel driver who was munching on steamed buns.</p>
<p>In that desert sea, where dust and sand flew in the air without end, when a string of camels met another team, everyone would wave their whips, and the camel drivers, as majestic as cavalry captains, would exchange a smile of mutual concern.</p>
<p>"You're starting early, oh—truly some good livestock."</p>
<p>Camel drivers always carefully observe other people's livestock, as knights admire their horses.</p>
<p>"Worth a hundred or so dollars each!"</p>
<p>Adjusting the ear flaps on their leather hats, they would stride past proudly, as if showing off their wealth.</p>
<p>Some camel drivers were merely employed, not owning their own livestock, but working for the owner of the camel team. In this type of camel team, not much camel bell sound could be heard. Only the first camel in the team had a bell around its neck, so the whole team of people and animals moved slowly forward, listening to this faint sound. On the rising humps, burlap bags or rope nets bounced incessantly.</p>
<p>"Hush..." The whip lashed through the air, and the gradually relaxed feet quickened again.</p>
<p>In the winter dawn, people and animals exhaled warm air into the cold, frosty air. The camel bells gradually swayed, and this sound wave suggested a determined heart trekking on a journey, unafraid of heavy snow cover, unafraid of the boundless desert sea, lightly blowing back a little echo in hardship.</p>

<p>Xiaoxiang's concubine is overwhelmed with sorrow. A myriad of thoughts, a touch of shame. Inconvenient to ask everyone with concern. I wonder if Baoyu's health has recovered. In order to avoid suspicion between children. I unconsciously forget my form and lose my freedom. The distance between the two sides is like thousands of miles. A day of separation is like three autumns. The root of the disaster lies in the fragrant silk belt. Let's talk about the youthful excellence of the pear garden. He insists on being flirtatious in front of others. Ignoring his father's frailness. He beat him. His skin was broken and his flesh was torn, and fresh blood flowed. Father and son are like wind horses and cattle. Several times in the Yihong Courtyard. Caringly inquired at the bedside. Before opening his mouth, he shed tears first. Seeing the bloody purple marks, both were swollen. He couldn't help but secretly feel pain and care. He prayed secretly to the gods and Buddhas. It was inconvenient to look at each other and say more. He could only secretly grieve and secretly worry. Difficult to caress lightly. He was afraid that. He would be troubled by Ninger, the young maid. Although they will eventually become a good couple. They have never had the matchmaker's plan. He cherishes jade and loves fragrance in vain. He dares to imitate Yun between Puyang and Sangjian. They are close but not equal.</p>

<p>Opening "Proverb Song" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>Strange and funny jokes are new. Fooling you all with nonsense. The world is changing with tricks. Giggling and groaning in misery. Muddled and confused, it's truly pleasant. Dazed and bewildered, blindly caught up in the excitement. Adults and big shots have bad consciences. Pretending to be foolish and bullying people. Wine, sex, wealth, and air, these four words. Rogues and dog heads, are most welcome. Small investment, big profit, ample family property. Wealthy and powerful, don't care. The resentment is strong, the poor suffer. How can they be free to make a living. Pitiful, the dwarf eating farts, who cares. The wicked compete for power. The most laughable is the young girl selling her charm. Dazzled by flowers, laughing is inappropriate. Disheveled hair, pretending to be fashionable. Chest out, belly protruding, dressing up in a new way. Red lips and white teeth, full of style. It's a pity her feet are small, and it's hard to walk. Oily hair dripping, fair skin and tender flesh are tempting to swallow. A gentle breeze, the fat man is short. Like the earth goddess in her previous life. She is skilled in many tricks. Pulling strings and arranging things, talking about love. Slapping the table and bench, gambling with copper coins. Shouting and yelling, making a lot of noise. Sore hands and feet, what a misery. Shaking head and wagging tail, what's the point. Later, the trick of transplanting fails. Borrowing someone else's child to scold their mother is embarrassing. Zhang San, Li Si, randomly playing tunes. Wine and meat friends, need mediation. Cunning tricks, trying to take advantage. The five ghosts and seven fiends, scolding the mountain. I advise you all to live your lives in a proper manner.</p>

<p>Opening "Outlaws of the Marsh Fighting the Tiger"</p>
<p>Heroes have always been strong in character. They fear neither high peaks nor tigers and leopards. Not believing the innkeeper's winding words. Seeing the notice, posted widely and publicly. Jingyang Ridge, there is a mottled tiger nearby. A lone traveler's life is easily lost. Sound the gong to alert the crowd to be careful. Wu Song said with a hearty laugh. Drunk, he took his stick and went up the mountain. Coincidentally, it was the bright light of the fifteenth moon. In the distance, he saw tall mountains and lush trees. Not believing that, in the mountain depression, there was a tiger's lair hidden. Who knew that suddenly the wind rose. From the forest, an evil tiger and wolf jumped out. Waving its claws and baring its teeth, wanting to show its strength. Wu Song held his eyebrow-level staff. Breaking it in the middle, he was alarmed. Thanks to him, his boxing skills were profound and mysterious. His name of fighting the tiger spread everywhere. The heroic spirit is unparalleled in the world.</p>

<p>Reminiscences of a Mother's Song</p>
<p>(1) The night is deep and silent. My heart is anxious. The sound is quiet. My dreams are distant. A gust of wind. Blows into my heart. Constantly broadcasting a lullaby. (I understand) It turns out that a loving mother wants her child to sleep peacefully. (Ah. I also remembered) My dear mother. Her hair is white and sparse. Her years are high. I also remembered that I was in swaddling clothes. Also in my mother's arms. Calling my little treasure. I have not forgotten. Remembering. Unconsciously, tears welled up like a waterfall. Separated from my flesh and blood, leaving my hometown. Mother, I can't think about it anymore. Can't think about it anymore. Can't think about it anymore.</p>
<p>(2) The moon is curved. My heart is bright. The wind is roaring. The clouds are floating. A faint sound. Sends to my ears. Constantly conveying laughter and joy. (I understand) It turns out that a loving mother is leading her child to be happy and not make trouble. (Ah. I also remembered) My dear mother. Her skin is old. Her lips and teeth are shaking. Remembering. I was in swaddling clothes. Also in my mother's arms. Kissing my little treasure. Who can forget. Recalling. Unconsciously, my heart aches like a stabbing knife. Returning to my hometown is a distant prospect. Mother, I can't think about it anymore. Can't think about it anymore. Can't think about it anymore.</p>

<h3>"Stubborn Stone Nodding" to Be Shown in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Child star Freddi Bartholomew has garnered much praise since starring in "David Copperfield." The public cannot forget this clever and precocious child. Following "David Copperfield," he starred in many other blockbusters, such as "Little Lord Fauntleroy" and "Little Orphan Annie." Recently, he co-starred with Hollywood's top child stars, Jackie Cooper and Mickey Rooney, in "Stubborn Stone Nodding." The story tells of three innocent children who, under certain circumstances, become classmates in a school. This becomes the starting point for many touching and tearful events. The director is Van Dyke, the director of the famous film "San Francisco." In this film, Van Dyke uses a clever technique to lightly depict the purest and most beautiful emotions in the world, presenting them to us like a moving picture. His skill is admirable. This film is one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's many blockbusters this year and is scheduled to be released at the Nanjing Grand Theater this Thursday.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from "Little Orphan Girl"</h3>
<p>"Little Orphan Girl" is expected to be released in early next month. This is China's first sound blockbuster starring a child star in a leading role. Xinhua officials are proceeding with caution in the production of the film, so that Shirley Temple cannot have a monopoly.</p>
<p>The material for "Little Orphan Girl" depicts the plight of a child experiencing many trials and tribulations. The plot is extremely tortuous, melancholic, and full of pathos.</p>
<p>The lead actress, Chen Juanjuan, with her profound expressions, skilled movements, and fluent dialogue, is perfectly suited to the plot, showcasing her talent.</p>
<p>"Little Orphan Girl" has a scene of the police arresting thieves, filmed on location at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, capturing the majestic panoramic view of the Public Security Bureau and the heroic姿 of the police officers.</p>
<p>Before the premiere of "Little Orphan Girl," Xinhua officials will publish a series of comic strips of "Little Orphan Girl," written by the famous cartoonist Zhang Leping. The content includes hundreds of pictures and photos, with exquisite and lovely printing, and a novel and pleasing design.</p>
<p>"Little Orphan Girl" has two songs, one named "Little Orphan Girl" and the other named "Sitting in a Circle," sung by Chen Juanjuan, which are exceptionally moving.</p>
<h3>Chen Juanjuan and Gu Er'yi in "Little Orphan Girl"</h3>
<h3>Interesting Tidbits from "Female Student"</h3>
<p>In one scene, Tao Jin returns home from Shanghai, bringing a box of cream cake. After this scene was filmed, Ge Pangzi and Weng Shouzi were rumbling with hunger and were about to snatch the cream cake when the props manager secretly mixed pepper powder into the cake, making the two fools enjoy themselves immensely.</p>
<p>Chen Qixia's hairdresser styled Chen Qixia's hair in many different styles throughout the film. The production director, Shen Yaron, said to the hairdresser, "It's a pity that we didn't take a photo of each style, otherwise we could hang them in the barbershop as examples."</p>
<p>Leng Bo plays Tao Jin's father. Every time they rehearsed, Tao Jin would call him "Dad," and he would always answer loudly. Tao Jin thought he was deliberately trying to take advantage, so during rehearsals, he called him "Leng Bo," and only called him "Dad" during the actual filming.</p>
<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>The Minxin Actors Registration Department receives an increasing number of actor registration letters every day.</p>
<p>"Gate of Flesh" is expected to be fully completed by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Ge Zuozi was originally injured in his right foot in the play "Gate of Flesh." However, when filming a court scene a few days ago, his right foot was actually injured. He wrapped it in medicinal cloth, which was perfect for the performance and looked very realistic.</p>
<p>Minxin's newly purchased American recorder has arrived. It is extremely clever, and the recording and photography are absolutely synchronized. Single and double negatives, AC and DC power can be applied at will. "New Humanitarianism" will be filmed and recorded with this machine. This machine is said to be the latest model.</p>
<p>"Gate of Flesh" is special and is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>"New Humanitarianism" is currently filming a hospital scene, in which the character Liu Fuweng, Liu Xiang, on his deathbed, suddenly hears a speech about saving disaster victims, and then changes his will, diverting the property given to his daughter to disaster relief. But before he could sign it, he died. Compared to the original silent "Humanitarianism," it is truly incomparable. The main actors speaking out are Hu Rong, Li Junpan, and many temporary actors.</p>
<p>Jin Qingyu's "Reading Record" is a national defense film about brothers reading on the wall and defending against foreign aggression.</p>
