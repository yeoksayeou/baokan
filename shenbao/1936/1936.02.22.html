<p>全國律師協會第七屆代表大會在上海開會集數十公團代表於一堂所揅討之議案頗多夫律師之於國家社會其任務爲擁護正義保障人權司法機關資爲協助法治精神藉以鞏固此項自由職業之集會自有其特殊之意義願乘此機爲律師界諸君進一言焉</p>
<p>我國律師制度雖行已數十年而淸末民初律師資格甄取尙嚴近則限制較寬法校畢業請領律師證書者漸夥重以社會各種事業不發達凡有律師資格者多數登錄而執行職務於通都大邑一時風發雲湧律師界殆不無過剩之感實則律師之爲用豈限於訴訟案伴哉非訟事件什伯倍於訴訟案件倘能於此更加注意則律師所能爲社會服務者固正多也</p>
<p>國家當過渡時期微獨齊民缺乏守法之觀念卽執政者亦未必能奉法如神明豪强恣睢外勢內侵司法者設不能表現其獨立之精神阿附曲從自喪國格滋可痛已所賴律界仗義之士起而糾正白是非於天下明法律之眞諦平反寃獄遏抑奸邪國家存亡絕續之樞機其在斯乎</p>
<p>此决代表大會議案達數十起或建議於當局或砥礪其本身或謀程序之變通或計法權之鞏固要皆從平日經騐中得來之甘苦乘茲大會發爲文章所望各項議案不徒爲案牘增成績並能一一見諸行事而深切著明也</p>
<p>律界諸君旣矢志爲社會服務矣則凡事之基基於道德研法律者允不可不以道德爲其本然社會機變之巧無所不用其極允須積經騐以相應付太剛則折太柔則屈智圓行方庶幾其適矣</p>

<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>「老百姓還能有報紙嗎？」又是一天早上，從馬營—寗夏省政府舊址—回寓的道上，一家店門前羅列滿新鮮的「大餅」，這在內地允共向居黌舍的我們所罕見，而我們事前早就下了决心，到西北去定然要做到生活西北化，纔能考察得着切實的情况，因此，這天的早飯，就打算來個西北化，購兩件葱汕大餅，充作一頓吧，大餅是在熱氣騰騰中從擺攤上檢出了幾件來，成一小份，錢也付過了，可是這油膩而熱辣的大餅，决不能當街就喫，於是喚賣餅的來張紙包，我想當然最適合不過的是廢舊的新聞紙，「我們老百姓家裏還能有報紙嗎？」這像爭持了很充分理由的話句，就是店家主人謝絕紙裹的說白，原來寗夏新聞事業的幼稚，也是無可諱言，報館只一家，每天出紙數量也不多，除了政府機關外，極少數的閱戶，那末，報紙在老百姓家裏自是不會有的，我們也只好嘆息着西北文化的落後吧了。</p>
<p>「來寗夏娶姨太太」，由於地理環境，影響到文化的落後，風氣尙未開通，一切都幼稚，敎育事業當然不能例外，更其是女子敎育，整個寗夏城內，只有一所女子中學，辦的是初中和附小，學生人數也很少，雖然入校讀書，不但免收任何學雜費用，而且連書本供給之外按月還發給幾塊錢的津貼，可是究竟爲了風氣閉塞，父母頑守的不悅意女孩子人家在往來學校的路上，拋頭露臉，家庭貧寒的，入校雖則不需花費，但就不願整天離開家裏，日中還得添補些衣服鞋襪，總想女兒在家裏帮忙料理點瑣事，一面還可以做些能獲相當利錢的工夫，至於入校讀書的女子，目的在求知的，固然所在多有，可是一部就學的女子，她們郤具着另外一種的企圖，進了學校，不就成爲「女學生」的地位了嗎，「女學生」，那可够時髦了，婚姻問題從此容易解决得多，因此只要婚姻成功，覓着了一位終身仰望的如意郞君，她們也就願償退學了，在她們眼光的天秤上，學農工商軍政警這幾種職業人中，她們把混在政塲裏的人物看得地位最重最高，所以，寗夏女子的理想丈夫，大都望政府機關工作人員隊裏選取，而且只要官高位要，那就不拘初婚續娶，有妻的亦願爲妾，做姨太太不論第幾房的，甚至做本淸不白的太太，良家女兒，也一樣的願意，受騙後離婚或被遺棄了，還甘心再去受騙，無怪外省籍的公務人員，大家都抱着「來寗夏娶姨太太」的論調，和實行這論調，這眞是女子敎育的畸形現象。</p>
<p>「誓不要緾足女子」從前寗夏婦女緾足的風氣最是盛行，婦女緾足極不合乎人道，影響民族的健康更大，近來寗夏省敎育當局同樣威覺這習慣不良，提倡天足運動，除在通衢要道張貼勸吿婦女民衆解放緾脚的宣傳品外，並製定一種白布紅邊黑字的臂章，長方形的印書着「誓不娶緾足女子」，分發全城男性未婚的中小學生配帶，果然觸目警惕，女子的家庭和她們本身，爲了終生幸福問題起見，大家都實行足部解放了，所以在省城十五六歲以下的小姑娘，再瞧不着往日那樣姍姍蓮步似的小脚，這是値得頌揚好光景，只是上了年紀的婦人和窮鄉僻壤裏，風氣固守的太厲害，會還有裹脚在蹣跚着的足跡。</p>
<p>一輩子沐浴三决，「哇哇墮地的誕生時，頭一决將全身沐浴過，要到花燭洞房的前夕，纔舉行二决的沐浴，往後一直至壽終正寢的棺歛時遍體沐浴是第三次，那已是人生最後一决的沐浴，而且是被動的了，」在寗夏多年的一位僑商，向我講述本地人「一輩子沐浴三决」的故事，也許言過其實，可是亦得窺一般老百姓的不重衛生了，大概氣候有點關係，純然是大陸性，省內多沙漠，空氣乾燥，夏季裏街上灰土積堆，風塵飛揚，衣服身體洗滌過，馬上又復染汚，懶漫是西北人們的根性，索性由得它了，習慣成了自然，冬季裏沒有雨而降雪，刮着大風，嚴冷的可怕，誰也不願露出體膚洗操了，老百姓都披上沒面老羊皮長衣，氈鞋毛帽，嘴裏身上噴出葱蒜羊肉的腥味，於是本地人的生活整天就在這髒汚的環境中度活，每天牽了驢子，牛或馬也許駱駝，牲口背上負着貨物，往市上尋找他們的主顧，</p>
<p>睡炕就是烟榻，鴉片姻是寗夏物產之一，比皮貨還要大宗，夏天裏五六月問，田野上開遍了萬紫千紅，那是罌花時節了，抽烟在寗夏已成極其普遍的現象，產量多，價錢賤，除了回敎徒少有嗜好外，人家的炕上大都有一盤烟具，甚至以大烟替代奉客的香茗，在交際應酬的塲合裏，中下級社會中人，抽食更多，男女一樣地勝任「老槍」的資格，貧苦的勞力者，家徒四壁，可是四壁以外，就是一盞烟燈，睡炕就是烟榻，簡直是寗可炊無米，不可居無烟，但是烟癮抽上，精神萎靡，也就是養成懶惰性情而至生活發生恐慌的大原因，</p>

<h3 id="c105">南京　小本借款處之透視　具有生產能力均可借貸共已借出三十五萬餘元 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>南京通訊、南京市小本借貸處、是與平民直接發生關係的一個組織、頃據該處營業主任袁紹賢、談該處情形甚詳、茲略紀如决、</p>
<p>南京市小本借貸處產生的原動力、可以說是歸功於金城銀行、該行總經理周作民、鑑於銀行的存在、必須使一般社會均獲共益、而實質上平民階級、很少得到實惠、因此自動擔任十萬元、一方由南京市政府認撥銀四萬八千元、首都警察廳認撥銀二千元、凑成十五萬元、作爲該處借貸基金、二十三年十二月三日組織成立、該處借貸的範圍、以經營小本工商業而缺乏資本者爲限、所以必須具有生產能力、方予以援助、至於不能生活的貧民、如乞丐。殘廢者、……該處絕對不予救濟、因爲這是一種救濟事業、而不是慈善事業、</p>
<p>貸欵的性質、的分爲　種籽貸欵、　耕牛貸欵、　貧民貸欵、　工商貸欵數類、前兩類的對象、全是農民、關於種籽貸欵借貸的手績、必須經過當地區鎭間或富農證明、確有若干田畝的、同時證明欵項借到之後、也確實作爲購買種籽、而不移作他用的、貸欵的數量、最少自四角起、多至十元左右、共計借出四一六六戶、一三七五一·八〇元、耕牛貸欵、也須經過證明的手續、並且保證該借欵人决不將耕牛出售的、同時當貸欵成立之後、由借貸處方面、將該耕牛加蓋火印、作爲標記、將來卽使出售、一經發現、也是作爲無效的、截至現在止、共計借出一千二百三十一戶、二萬三千二百二十元、其决爲貧民貸欵、所謂貧民、乃是具有生產能力、而缺乏資本的、最多以五元爲限、不收利息、五個月內償淸、共計借出六四四九戶、三兒一七八·〇〇元、最後爲工商貸欵、這是以經營小本工商業爲對象的、貸欵的數量、自六元起至二百元止、利息分爲四等、計六元至二十元七厘、二十一元至五十元八厘、五十一元至一百元九厘、一百零一元至二百元一分、共計借出四千九百六十三戶、二十八萬五千零四十五元、總計借出一萬六千八百一十戶、三十五萬四千一百九十四元八角、平均每戶借銀二十一元零七分、</p>
<p>關於借欵的手續、首先由借欵人塡具申請書、寫明借欵的數目。用途。償還期限等、送交該處指定的代辦所—自治區公所—全市共有十一處、經過嚴密的調査、加以評定、然後送達該處核準、再由代辦所通知原借欵人、辦理借欵手續、如塡寫借據、保證人蓋章等、最後便可如數領欵償還的期限、規定一年、但是借欵人如果能够提前歸還、可以聽便、償還的方法、分定期·分期·活期·數種、任聽借欵人擇定、發給還欵計數表、載明分期應還欵項及到期年月日、由借欵人準時前往償還、至過去一年以來、借欵人頗能遵守信用、很少有到期拖欠的、對於該處業務的推進、實在具有一種莫大的帮助、同時也很値得稱述的</p>
<p>該處的存在、對於社會、究竟能有多大的裨益呢、這是頗値得討論的一個問題、據袁君言、當去年廢曆年終、下關方面、大約有三四十家商店、幾乎快倒閉了、幸而得到該處的帮助、方才維持過去、又據該處調査、借欵人每戶平均的六七人、總計已達十萬人以上、以十五萬元的基金、而借貸的數量、竟達三十五萬餘元之鉅、受惠人數、又復如是之多、—占全市人口十分之一—在這一點、該處自有共存在的價値了、</p>
<p>南京市內很大的商店、如綢緞店。西藥房。飯菜館等、也時常向該處請求借貸的、該處職員曾說、你們是具有數萬或十數萬資本的大商店、何必向小本借貸處來借欵呢、答案大致如此、店方資本雖大、但是都已採辦貨物、以致流動現金、週轉不靈、銀行方面、又不肯向商家放欵、店方因急待付欵、明知小本借貸處不能多借、但是能够借到兩百元、便可渡過目前的難關了、最後還要求代守秘密、因爲關係該店的聲譽和體面、如果這項消息、透露出去、勢必遭受傾軋的影響、而發生動搖了、</p>
<p>此外因了辦貨的關係、必須凑成鉅欵、便也來向該處吿貨了、南京市面金融枯竭的情形、究竟到達了一種什麼境地呢、在這裏、我們便可以得到一個很確切的答案了、</p>
<p>該處最近因業務的發展、擬再增加基金五萬元、連前共爲二十萬元、聞不久卽可實現、那時更可增高該處借貸的效力、以發揮其最大的功用了、</p>

<p>實行經濟自給</p>
<p>年來水旱洊臻、瘡痍滿目、而全國農村凋敝、工商萎縮、國內生產日形短少貿易入超之鉅、年達七八萬萬元、不獨工業製品仰給外人、即所需糧食、亦復不能自給、經濟崩潰、迫在目前、國之滅亡、可立而待、為今之計、呈應徹底覺悟、痛自振拔、誓以國民自救之精神、實行經濟自給之政策、萃全國人民之財力民力、集中於經濟建設、本諸確定計劃、尅日以計成功、</p>
<p>政府確定計劃</p>
<p>我國土地廣大、物產豐饒、其天然生產力、實不亞於歐美各國、而所賴利用天然力以求生產之萬進者、厥惟勤苦之毅力、堅强之意志、明敏之計劃、要在不賴他人、而以自力爲主、蘇俄與意大利、其瘠苦蓋甚於我國、而一則實行五年計劃、一則標榜自給政策、均賴其國人勤苦自勵、節衣縮食、致力生產、卒獲臻國家於繁榮、日本國小民貧、而以人民努力奮鬥、遂亦得以工商立國、稱雄世界、此數國者、雖所用方法不同、而以自救而成功、初無二致、我國丁此世界經濟競爭激烈之秋、應由政府確立生產建設計劃、督勵人民、兼程並進、庶幾傾危之局、得以挽回、</p>
<p>生產建設原則</p>
<p>生產建設、頭緒甚繁、而地盡其利、人盡其才、物盡其用、數語可以包括而無遺、所謂地盡其利者、不僅使土壤肥沃、宜於種植之地、能盡其墾闢之利而已、即磽瘠斥鹵之區、人人認爲棄地者、亦必設法改良試種、求達增加生產之目的、所謂人盡其才者、不僅使習能之士、各得共所、游惰之民、皆有職業、全國無一坐食之人而已、更須以一人兼兩人之用、一日成兩日之功、則消費少而生產多、得以最廉之費用、得最大之效果、所謂物盡其用者、不僅使山海之藏、不棄於地、竹頭木屑、皆適於用而已、更須移無益之用、以歸於有益之用、移收益較少之用、以歸於收益較多之用、則生產之力愈宏、其利愈溥、以上所述、爲生產建設之原則、至其詳細辦法大綱、茲爲撮要條列於左、</p>

<p>保障銀行信用</p>
<p>自世界經濟恐慌發生、各國金融緊縮、百業均大受影響、即資本雄摩之美國、亦施行緊急處分辦法、由政府援助銀行、始獲漸臻安定、我國各銀行資本薄弱、組織亦不健全、而工商事業、復亟待融通資金、以圖發展非政府對於各銀行力予援助、使得安心投資於各業、則一遇風險、即可立致崩潰、此後擬對於各銀行之資金運用、保管合法者、由政府酌爲保障、並令對於農工事業、予以低利貸欵、其利息之虧耗、由政府酌予補助、蔗幾金融基礎、得以鞏固、而產業之發達、亦可預期、</p>

<p>統一國營事業</p>
<p>生產事業、貴於集中、不特收效較宏、費用亦省、以我國資力簿弱、人才缺乏、如各種建設事業、組織紛歧事權分化、計盡旣慮不周、成本亦將加重、自不免有事倍功半之虞、應將各項國營事業、設法統一集中、凡不必要吸重複之設備、均予廢除、駢枝機關、均予裁汰、以期减少經費支出、增加工作效能、請由政府召集各主管機關、妥爲議定切實辦法、决第實施、</p>

<p>吸食鴉片論罪</p>
<p>不服者一也、　退一步言、卽係吸烟、而標烟總監所頒厲行戒烟取締吸戶章、凡年老或疾病致吸食成癮、一時不能戒除者、經醫生或戒烟機關之診斷證明、得聲請註册、領取限期戒烟執照、准其暫行吸食、但六年以內、必須逐漸戒除、期滿不得再請展期領照等語、被告等業經遵章、辦理一切手續、於是一方由禁烟機關發給執照、因一時不能戒除、許可其吸食、一方又嚴禁吸食、凡吸食乾有罪</p>

<p>何以出爾反爾、前後矛盾若此、將國家之威信何在、且限期一月內戒絕這判决、於理亦不合、果爾醫師及戒烟機關之證明、豈非多事、六年之期、旣為明章所許、亦保所謂一時不能戒除、總之、本案旣經依照禁烟治罪暫行條例第八條處斷、則禁烟治罪條例後半段之規定、此理於法不合、於情不順、</p>

<p>但因年老疾病</p>
<p>一時不能戒除者、得令補領執照、不服從勒戒、或不遵繳照費者、依法懲處、現在本案情節、旣經因疾病一時不能戒除、經醫師及禁烟機關之證明、領有執照者、非不遵繳照費者可比、殊無移送法院懲處之必要、其移送法院、已將立法之本旨失去、法院遽以判罪、尤有不能貫通法令、顯為失實之嫌、何能使人折服、　本案旣依照禁烟治罪暂行條例第八條之規定處斷、但對於同條例第十九條之規定、</p>

<p>— 中國徽信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之十四）</p>
<p>五、過去一年及最近之紙市况按過去一年而言，世界各國之造紙業皆有好轉蓬勃之象，如美國，加拿大，瑞典，挪威諸大產紙國家之造紙廠，皆以全速度轉動其造紙機，所差者僅紙價未見同比例而上漲。至於中國（特別是上海）其市况都形衰落，惟爲首四月稍有例外。自一月至三月，本埠洋紙市况非常活躍，自美國加拿大之洋紙進口額甚大，但自三月終以後，一部份因謠傳修改關稅之故，市場需要頓見下落，華南華北幾毫無銷路。此中不容忽視者，即日紙反暢銷華北各地。迨至十月，情勢激變，因新貨幣政策之謠傳已甚囂塵上，紙價已呈猛漲。當時有六家蛟小之進口商，因對於海外定貨並未付價，在匯兌上大受損失，以致倒閉，蓋當時對英外匯巳自十八便士降至十四便士。在新法幣頒佈之前後，本埠紙價之上下甚爲顯著，今擇紙數種，列表比較於後：</p>
<p>十月八日十月二十十一月份評評價四日評價價白有光紙每令二元三元五角二元七角五二角分捲筒報紙每令二元三元二角三元六角四角道林紙每公斤二二角三分二角四分角一分五小臘光紙每令十元十一元十二元五角牛皮紙每令六元七元八元三角二角</p>
<p>註：評價即紙業公會評定之價，爲一般市價之凖。</p>
<p>最近各種紙價，因銷路滯塞之故，又有微跌之趨勢，而允以連史紙毛邊紙爲最，因連史紙毛邊紙，國產者亦甚精良，堪與日貨媲美，目下各廠商又有與日貨抗衡之意，故其市價下降較大。今將最近調査所得，列記於下：</p>
<p>大中華速史，每令自三元一角至三元六角，毛邊售價相同。</p>
<p>寳山速史與毛邊，上等每令三元五六角，中等三元二三角，决等二元九角。</p>
<p>上海連史每令自三元至三元五角，毛邊自三元一角至三元三角。</p>
<p>源泰森記連史毛邊，每令售三元一角至三元二角。</p>
<p>江南連史毛邊售價仍照去年八月間所訂定之價格，連史最小每令三元七角半，最大四元六七角，較他廠出品高出一元左右。</p>
<p>天章昌記道林紙，每磅售一角一分（扣佣）繪畫紙與書面紙價相同。</p>
<p>龍章道林紙，每磅一角八分（扣九六或九七回佣，紙商向該公司買貨可有回佣。）其所出連史因包裝不同（有十刀一件，有十五刀一件，最多爲四十四刀一件），售價亦自每件六元五角至十三元一角不等。</p>
<p>美錦小蠟光每令的售十元，竟成黃紙版每噸售八十餘元（批價七十四元），灰報紙每令二元二角（批價二元）。</p>
<p>近來連史毛邊銷路甚佳，允以售價低廉之普通物貨，銷路最多（如售三元至三元一二角者）。各紙廠因供不敷求，乃加工趕造，殊爲忙碌，其中以寳山。大中華。上海三廠爲發達。（完）</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>居家幾星期以後，小橋回到校裏來了，他看去似乎已從他的痛悼中回復了轉來，這是不得不要感謝兒童時代容易張弛屈伸的特性，他確也回復了一些；可見他並不忘記，因爲他的本性是這麼一般，經過的事自會深深浸入，仔細濾過，然後滲透到裏面的泉源，以灌漑他靈敏的心思而助長其諸種的小德性。他游玩，學習，工作，有時也唱着歌，一切毫不異於從前，別人也不易猜到什麽變動；可是其中却有一個人——蜀姨母却已見到了——因爲她全心看護這個童子，要想自己去代替喬恩的位置，這眞是她一片的苦心。他難得說到他的不幸，可是蜀姨母常於晚間聽到輕輕的啜泣從小床裏出來，等她去安慰他的時候，他只喊着：「我要我的父親，啊，我要我的父親！」——他們父子間的關聯是很密切而美滿的，當這個關聯一斷，孩子的心也破裂了。可是「時間」漸漸補滿了他的創痕，他漸漸覺得他並未失去他的父親，只是暫時的隱沒，而總有一日要見到他，那時必然是一樣强健而慈和，雖然他的小兒子要在他父親慕上見到那紫色的美菊花開花落得許多許多决數，才能重行相會呢。</p>
<p>外觀的變遷也隨着那內心的變遷而同時進行着，因爲在那幾個星期裏小橋似乎長大了，開始拋棄了他那種孩于們的戲耍，並不以它們爲可羞，像有些孩子們所覺到的，却是因爲他的興趣也已趕過了它們，而需要一些較合於大人們的東西了。他開始愛好素所厭恨的算學，努力不懈地學着，他的姨丈見了頗爲驚喜，但不明白其新興趣的由來，直到小梅說道：</p>
<p>「等到我長大時，我要做一個會計員像爸爸一樣，所以我必須懂得算數一類的事情不然我就不能有他那種淸楚整潔的帳簿了』</p>

<p>— 王天予</p>
<p>上海輸出生絲，一至十一月的十一個月中，輸了達四八，〇八八包，較去年增加二倍有奇。廣東則輸出减少，僅達一八、一九二包，內銷額約為一萬餘包、較去年减五〇％。</p>
<p>綜上所述，一九三五年的冀絲業雖由上半年消沉而轉向下半年的蓬勃，國內的從業者也大都在額手相慶。可是在這種景氣的局面之下，有許多絲廠竟因原料缺乏而被迫停工，這：第一是因為年來絲銷滯呆與絲價暴落的結果，使有　農大都　有厭棄養　的心理，以致伐桑植禾的結果，江浙的桑園是减去了三分之一左右。第二是政府因為一九三四年秋季統制秋種果，致　種大景過剩的敎訓，限制一九三年春秋季　各睥產　，而沒有想到上次的敎訓是在天旱的特殊情形之下，因此弄得有養　的農民，而沒有被飼育的　種的空前大種荒。所以在一九三五年的　絲業，雖有較景氣的　遇，但因原料問題產制，形成了唯一的缺憾。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我們暁得一九三五年絲價的上騰，主要是由於消費增加的刺激，但是其他消極的原因，也足促使絲價的勞動，這：我們可以分幾方面來說：</p>
<p>第一是世界經濟的轉幾。世界經濟的由「恐慌」而進至「蕭條」，雖然並不是常軌的轉機，而是國際羊因為政治的不安矛盾的尖銳化而引起的軍需工業下「火藥氣味」的景氣。這種景氣，於整個經濟固無力推動，但於些微的冀絲消費、却因這種景氣而刺激幾中了。美國消費量的增加，不能不說是因由於此。因為加入勞動總同盟的工人失業者比率的回升形减少，和全體工廠中就業工人的數量亦微有增加的綠故，雖然還比不上一九三〇年，可是因為失業的略有减少，也足够增加消费了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 經</p>
<p>婦女解放，一般的都說是「到社會服務去」。不錯，婦女去服務於社會，果然是解放，但把「解放」二字，只限於服務社會，那家以為是錯誤的。我以為婦女在解放的旗　之下，相當的服務於社會，那是對的。若是為了解放，而以服務於社會，為婦女的惟一天職，此外，甚麼乾不管，那是錯誤的。</p>
<p>例子是最近我的一位朋友的家庭中發生。朋友的夫人，是一位受着充分敎育的新女子，也会領導過小規模的婦女運動。自從和我的朋友結婚之後，方度蜜月，便在一個機關中任職。家裏　着二個老媽子，司洗滌煮飯之責。而伊自己呢，在公餘之暇，只是拖着丈夫，出去玩耍。若是丈夫不高興去時伊便一個人出去。</p>
<p>我那朋友，雖不頑固，但是頗愛度着悠閑的家庭生活的。起初本想和伊結婚了，可以在雙方公事完畢後，享受些　房之樂，但結婚之後中，他的夫人，還是那麼的愛玩，不免的頗以為苦。於是回略加規諫。豈知便大觸他夫人之怒，說，「你要討一個奴婢一般的妻子，便該向農村裏去找尋。」</p>
<p>結婚了一年，在去年秋間，伊忽然懷孕了。我那朋友，本就　到家庭之中，太寂寞，所以得知伊有了孕，很是歡喜。豈知過了幾天，伊忽然偷偷地去把胎墮了。我的朋友，很不以為然，謚是雙方的感情，便逐漸地惡劣起來了。他夫人的唯一理由，是「要我做十九世紀的賢母良良妻，那是休息。」</p>
<p>從這一個例看來，「賢母良妻」，在現代女性瞧來，是半個大錢都不値的了。但是，瞧哪，德國現在有一句很普遍的口號，「女子回進家庭去。」回進家庭去，幹甚麼　自然是「治理家政，」「撫育子女。」「治理家政，」「撫育子女，」雖非直接為社會服務，但是間接的，也未始不是在為民族圖存。而且在實際上，或許比了直接為社會服務，其收效更宏。</p>
<p>蘇俄，我們素來知道是一個不注意家庭制度的社會主義的國家。蘇俄婦女，是和男子們一樣地作工的。但是據最近的調查，說的政府已限制着離婚，墮胎，以及不顧子女贍養等破壞家庭組織的行為了。而同時，家庭中，自備餐饍的，也相當地增加。莫斯科和其近郊的二百餘工人宿舍，三百餘公共食堂，比了三年前的營業，已减退了百分之四十左右。托兒所，却一天發達似一天。從這裏，也可見到蘇俄一般婦女，對於家庭生活的認識了。</p>
<p>日本的婦女，雖然在四十歲以下的，沒有不曾受過和當敎育的，但是伊們却每一個，都夠得上資可知稱賢母良妻。雖然在日本，婦女職業，已是比了我國發達到不知若干倍，但是伊們在社會服務時間完畢之後，回到家裏來，還是「治理家政，」「撫育子女，」和丈夫度着很諧和的家庭生活。</p>
<p>美國白宮中的雖斯福總統夫人，在工作時間中，是總統的一個處理政務的助手，在工作時間之外，伊是總謝絕參觀的家庭中的最高負責者。從總統的健康，一直到屋子的整潔，都是伊所負担的责任。若是白宫中有宴会时，据说，總統夫人，不審時常上廚房去，親自烹煮呢。</p>
<p>因此，我覺得有知識的現代女性，不該以會得服務於社會，自認為了不起。要做一個了不起的現代女性，該於服務社會之暇，再服務於家庭。</p>
<p>在社會，是職業婦女，在家庭，是賢母良良妻，這才是現代的標準女性。</p>
<h3 id="c215">美國女子的「擇夫難」 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>在美國，生育率上雖然男孩子和女孩子的數目差不多是相等的，但是一般女子，總感到缺乏「好丈夫」的恐慌。似乎女子有了過剩的現象。這種現象，顧然不是生物學上的。</p>
<p>就世界歷史上一般現象而言，優越的男性總比女性來得多些。而低能的男子如白　之　，也以男子為多。這些低能的男子生理上結婚是並非不可能的。但一般都　女子吐棄做了獨身的鰥漢。</p>
<p>適宜做丈夫的男子所以感到缺乏的主因：每一是丈夫的才能必須較高謚妻子，才不至有套色鳳隨鴉之感；第二是妻子的年齡必須較小丈夫，才易謚秦夫唱婦隨這　；第三凡受過高等敎育的女子的擇配的標凖過嚴，在對方面也易生齊大非偶之慮。</p>
<p>從這幾個觀點上呆以明瞭凡心裏蘊藏着「擇夫難」的感想的必受過高等敎育的女子為尤甚。根據許多大學及專門學校的統計，畢業的女生有半數以下四分之一以上是獨身而終的。這些愛過向等敎育的女子自已感愛了畢生孤獨的苦悶；而社會上也無形中損失了如許的賢妻良母。</p>
<p>現在受過相當敎育的女子大都預備在畢業以後獻身　會，可是多數婦女職業不外是敎師，保姆，看護，圖書館員等等。在這些塲合，未婚的男子不一定占着多數。加以女子好自矜貴，不屑輕易走上羅曼的行徑。而大多數男子的擇配，不一定歡迎正派的女子。他們利用女子愛好虛榮心裏，有的出以引誘，有的簡直等於拐騙。愈是矜貴的女子愈不容易和男子相接的近。</p>
<p>反之，尋常女子擇配條件自然比較的不事苛責，甚且降可知相就。婚姻的可能性自然多了。至於那些受過高等敎育存着奢望的女子起初是把擇配標準過分提高，等到所願不逐，年事漸長，自己覺得青春不待，標準降低，而對手方或者也以年齡不相稱而不肯遷就了。</p>
<p>美國平均的結婚年齡是男子二十五，女子二十一。大學畢業的女子差不多較結婚年齡已超守兩三年了。但在男子總須選擇比自已小着两三年的女子。二十五六的女子只能配给三十以上的男子了。而且志氣較高尚的女子，總喜歡在大學畢業以後做了幾年事情，得些報酬為結婚的準備；甚或還請她在求學時所負的債務。一年年的躭延下去，而配婚的年齡標準俞差得遠了。據京都壽險公司譚伯林博士的統計：二十歲的女子，在十年之內平均有二次至一次的結婚機會。三十歲的女子在十年之內有二分之一次的結婚機會，結果就有大批才能優越的女子獨身孤寂，抱明月而長終！</p>
<p>總而言之，愛過相當敎育的女子要享受正常的夫婦生活，那在青春的二十歲以前，總要實事求是的相機擇配，切莫把賓貴的花信時光輕易的錯過。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>「林先生為幽默作家，敢問對於現代女性有佣批評？」</p>
<p>他想了一想，又對他夫人一笑，話就來了：「我看好出風頭的女性，都是壞蛋！大凡優良的女性，不喜出風頭的，只是在家裏不聲不響的敎養子女，盡她大賦的使命。新賢妻良母，是多麼高貴的天職？因為男人不能在家做妻做母的工作，只得由女人來做。所以一個女人，必須做賢妻良母，而男人就得做賢夫良父。」他停了一會，又說：「在政治上最出風頭的女性，最是壞蛋，但她們不足以代表新女性的。」這句話說完，　夫人表示反對，她說「你這話太過火了，難怪小報要造你謠言。」他說「是事實，並非過甚之談。」</p>
<p>「照此說來，林先生理想中的新女性該怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>他笑起來了，好像難以答復的樣子；一會兒，又滔滔不絕的說：「這話說來太長吧，幾句話怎講得完呢？」</p>
<p>「只好千句併一句，請縮短些說罷，」我說。</p>
<p>「那好！我理想中的新女性，第一身體要比以前健康；第一中國女子都有依賴性，不及西洋女子的獨立精神，這也許是社會的態度壓迫她們的結果。中國女子不　西洋女子的活潑，但靜和的態　，却勝過她們；將來的女性中和起來；第三性道德要比現在解放，我反對男子可以解放，我反對男子可以解放性慾，可以嫖，可以離婚，再娶，而女性不能自由。有人說解放女子的性道德，社會風化就更壞，這是一偏之見，若然把社會風化弄壞的責任，要卸在女子身上，未免太殘酷，太不公平了。總之解放婦婦，先　改正社會的態度，偈　元洪的　轉嫁，轟動了全社會，一致的攻擊她，竟致　　出境，這　豈有此理！</p>
<p>至此林先生的話，告　叚落，我又和他夫人談了好久，先問「夫人對林先生取什麼態度？」「雙方取互助合作的態度，家常事務，全由我負責，比較重要的，共同商量，决定辦法。」</p>
<p>「請夫人談談治家的經騐。」</p>
<p>「家常事務，無所謂經騐，敬以四點拉雜說來：　我主張家庭經濟公開，大家庭往往在經濟上作弊，私下積蓄，其結果釀成種種慘變；　確定預算决算，開支不超過預算，家政　不致於紊亂；　對兒女從小養成自動　慣，不　手於　　，發展共　性，不用　力張個；如小孩犯過，用而部　倩，使其覺悟；不能時常責罵，多罵必失其效力；有時可借他人的事，間接的訓導；　　　自主，從前我倆肉中刺在美德兩國留學多年，烹飪洗衣等事，完全自理，現在雖　婢僕代勞，但　每　必取監督的態度，因為家庭衛生，首重飲食，若委諸他人，終非可　之事。」</p>
<p>「夫人對新　家庭的意見如何？」</p>
<p>「我贊成小家庭制，因為經濟獨立，不依賴，不推諉，能發菜主婦的能力，沒有新舊意見衝突的可能，這些為大家庭所不及的。但對於父母的贍養，為分內事，萬不能疏忽的。我以為不論家庭新舊大小，而主　不能　人民卸洽家的天職，不能過分的游樂；不穿不合身分的奇裝艶服；不能疏忽男女的敎養；家事之外，萬不能忘却求智慾，與社會公益的稟業。」</p>
<p>「夫人每日玩些什娛樂？」這時林先生放下筆，搶着說：「我倆每天在郊外走路，跟小孩兒玩，不常看電影，偶然去跳舞，常赴友人的宴會，此外沒有什麼了。」</p>
<p>無意之間，談了一時半的話大家是忙人，我只得告辭了。</p>
<p>正誤　上期本文第一行「我去訪問的前夕，」我字下多一「們」字，第十五行「我的政府與人民」，「　」誤排「等」，第二十三得「林夫人挿言道」挿言誤作「播音」，特為校正。</p>
<h3 id="c217">美人和犯罪 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 慧芳</p>
<p>在「性的淘汰」上，優勝諸美貌的歸人。一般人對於美人都有愛好之心，而對於醜婦，則發生壓惡和不快。因此之故，一般人對於美人都有愛好之心，而對於醜婦，則發生壓惡和不快。因此之故，一般人常以極寛容和善的態度對等美人，而待醜婦以過分的冷淡和刻薄。不論何時何地，美人常受到很多異性的歡迎，容易得到性的滿足，而醜婦則反之。</p>
<p>正因為美人容易獲得異性的歡心，和社會上的寛厚的待遇，常使伊們墜入日常生活的危險之中。毒婦和妖婦，多半屬於美人，這是很顯見的。推究其原因，可析為六：一，因為一般人對待美人，常極寬恕。二，美人自覺為「性的優勝者」，於日常的生活上，生出怠慢的趨向。三，美人易得他人的愛好和欵待，容易發生各種社交的關係。四，美人大多是虛榮的奴隷。五，美人容易引起異性的誘惑，在性的方面發生過失。六，美人在裝飾品和衣服之上，浪費較醜奴為多。</p>
<p>並且，美貌的婦人，常使男子願為其愛護者，對伊唯命是聽。而社會上一般人，多為其美貌所愚，誤信如是美人，是不會發生恐怖的犯罪行為的。</p>
<p>以上所述，都是使美人自己容易做錯事的理由。次之，往往由於異性的綠故，而陷於很大的不幸，或者做出很大的過失。美人常是異性注意的焦點，使許多愛慕伊的男子，發生競爭。因為戀愛的糾紛，一方面愛到同性婦女的猜疑，另一方面又受到異性的嫉妬，比諸普通的利慾，格外强烈，因此所受的危險，也更加厲害。由於男女間的糾紛，而發生傷害殺人的悲劇，是非常之多的。</p>
<p>再進一層，男子袒護美人，在許多地方，果無害處，但若是惡性的男子有美貌的妻了時，則常利用伊的美麗，誇耀世人，因此更逞他的惡行。「在大罪的背後，必有婦人」，這句話成語是含有眞理的，它的意思是，婦女是直接間接和罪惡有關的，特別是說，美人易使男子做出更大的犯罪的行為。</p>

<h3 id="c218">歌謠中的婦女問題 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>「阿媽娘，硬心腸，賣我出去做梅香！着個破衣裳，吃個　菜湯，　個嘸脚床，走个暗弄堂，打个冤屈棒，東家貪財心腸硬，再賣出去做偏房，大娘做凶多管束，時常　氣塞胸膛」</p>
<p>上面這一首歌謠，是我鄕南匯所流行的。我們假如把這首歌謠，細細的研究一番，推考一下，眞覺得是一字一　，非常可憐，誠然是一個婦女界應該注意的問題。</p>
<p>奴婢制度，照人類平等的意義說來，眞是一件挺不合理的事，而且也是一件遠法的事，收賣了人家的女兒，作為自己的奴隸，如果能好好的待伊，好好的敎養伊，使伊成功一個窮人，使伊也能享受到種種人權利和待遇，那也罷了。如今有許多稍微有一些錢的富有之家，他們對於奴婢的待遇，有幾家能跳出這道首歌謠之範圍之外呢？說起來眞夠我們關心媂女運動的人，非常的痛心，非常的憤慨！</p>
<p>在不久以前，會在報紙上看到，廣東婦女界為了反對蓄婢制度起見，會發起一個廢婢運動宣傳週，在這個廢婢運動宣傳週裏，曾經轟轟烈烈幹了一番廢婢宣傳的工作，這是對於陷入十八層地獄中的婢女們，實在是一個很好的福音。我很希望社會上有地位的，有能力的婦女界的領導們，大家不要忽略這個問題，也繼起直追，來幹一下這個含有重大意義的廢婢運動吧？</p>

<p>那一天，不拘是春天，或夏天，好歹總有這麼一天就是了！這個什東西都不怕，連見了街上人都害怕的劉瘋子也不知道回避的小啞叭，忽然在一家荳腐店的門前，露出了一個出人意外的弱點。他先是蹲在街上捉弄着一條小狗，神氣非常的高興，一張鳥黑的小臉上，堆滿着頑皮而可愛的笑容；衣角全漫到了一泓汚水裏也不會覺得，身子兀是在往後灣下去，背部差不多要貼到水面上了，狗就在他前胸上伏着。见惯他這種頭皮相的人都在朝着他微笑，不料这孩子突然像觸了電氣一般的跳了起來，把那狗也放開了，臉色變成灰白，彷彿是受了什麼大　嚇似的用手捧着腦袋，沒命的跳進了那家豆腐店的　台去，掩在一个夥計的身後，着力抱住了這人的　子，混身索索地抖着；當然，這樣一來，大家都給他　動了！</p>
<p>「咦！這孩子為什麼這樣害怕起業了？」</p>
<p>有的人在互相疑問着；那豆腐店裏的夥計却很可慘他，忙旋過身法　着他們道：</p>

<p>「一條蛇！一條蛇！」</p>
<p>這樣，大家　知道這個神秘的野孩子乃是見了一條小蛇而那樣吃慌的。</p>
<p>過了一天，他又上市來了，有幾個人存心想試試他，先打叫化子那裏買來了一條已拔去牙的三四尺長的火赤練，故意丟到他近身去，一面還着：</p>
<p>「啊呀！蛇来了！蛇来了！」</p>
<p>這一回，這具啞叭是受驚更甚了，他一路逃回去，哭得幾乎回不過氣來；從這天　，他足足有一個金月不會敢出　，上街買辦　物的差使，便重復又讓他老子！那具不知名姓的軍官！担任了去。</p>

<p>本症就其部位而言。有子宮體白帶。前庭白帶。頭管白帶。陰道白帶等之分。大抵多爲炎症之結果。常流出一種膿性分泌物。精蟲遇之。卽遭撲殺。故爲婦女不姙症中之最顯著而重大者。</p>
<p>婦女以環境所格。禮敎所縛。每視白帶爲秘密隱病。無從服藥。遑論延醫。隱諱纏綿。因循遷延。不惟身體失去健美。姙娠絕望。且炎症影響所及。病變百出。虧損特甚。</p>
<p>本症治法。不一而足。一般所習用者。有全身療法，局部洗滌法，外陰部乾燥法，生物學療法等。</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>日本邇來很注重文化外交的推行，宣揚文化於海外，將爲今年日本外交政策的重耍項目之一。廣田外相在第六十八决議會的外交演辭中，對於此點，主張甚力。現在協議的結果，决定以國際文化事業費一百萬元，進行各項的文化工作，與世界各國謀文化的親善提携。此亦足見日本善於發揮外交政策的一斑</p>
<p>由此使我們想到我國有建設文化國防的必要。我國目前國難一天天的加重，一切行動，應皆以救亡圖存爲目標。我們不但軍事方面，耍有充實的準備，使軍事國防，能臻於强固。便是文化方面，也非有一番的振作不成。文化的振作，傚日本的推行文化外交，我們恐尙無暇及此。但在國內建立一個有力量的文化國防，當是很急切之舉，救國是全國人民的責任，負有領導社會的文化界，更應站在前錢，努力奮鬥。此爲文化界人應盡的時代任務。</p>
<p>要救今日垂危的中國，綜合全國各方所表示出來的民意，加以觀察，唯一一的方策，决爲發動民族解放運動。文化國防的建設，自也應循此途徑進行。一般從事於文化事業的人們，須由文化方面，極力鼓吹，使此一運動，能早日實現。不但要鼓吹，還耍引導。在我國的民族解放運動中，文化界當是先鋒的戰土。</p>
<p>一二八的抗敵，是我國民族解放運動的第一聲。最近十二九以後，全國各地相繼發動的學生運動，便是此運動的擴展。此後建立文化國防的責任，常能由此種運動來担負。</p>
<p>然建設，文化國防，應如何推進呢？關於此一點，應從各方面加以說明。敎育界須改變敎育方針，實施適合國難時期的敎育。此事現正由敎育部研究中，一部分敎育人士，也在熱心討論，將來定有相當的效果。言論界須報吿正確的消息，並以公正的輿論，喚起民衆的覺醒。執筆者須用各樣的方式，激發人民的　爭意識。其他各種女化機關，也應本各自的文化領域，各盡一分的職責。總之，從文化方面，努力推行救國運動，是今後文化界建立文化國防應有的重大任務。</p>

<p>這茶館坐落在長街頂熱鬧的地段，店面雖不怎樣大，但擺列二十幾隻四方桌圓桌是仍不覺擁擠侷促的。它是在李三爹老子的一代便開設，時日終是極遠的了。這老就那門腦上塊鐫者「錦興」兩個大凸字的招牌，因爲日子久，給日光和姻氣薰得黑透，又積滿灰塵，幾乎糢糊辨不清　者什麽字上即想出來。</p>

<p>第一個降臨的總逃不了是那有一頭白髮兩撇濃鬍子的日昇伯，茶館中一個資格最老的主顧，他每天必來，佔着一定的座位。因此差不多沒人不認識他，他頂喜歡撩閒，一開口往往聒絮不休，可以說是太嚕囌的，但他人老，性子又溫和，故此人都不討厭他。有時他還成爲茶店中最合人口胃的臨時講故事者。</p>
<p>他走路很迂緩，來的時候，先走到櫃檯那兒跟老闆李三爹點點首，另後從那半新舊的長袍口袋里摸出一隻旱烟筒來，便走向旁邊一隻認定的桌子去，燃着紙捲，緩緩抽着烟一邊合老闆談說。</p>
<p>不多幾久喝茶客便充滿一店子，沒賸空位了。</p>
<p>那些人，有是常川主顧，有是走遠程的偶爾借爲歇歇脚，也有是從近鄰的村中，作完活計趕集來散散悶的。</p>
<p>總之，一到下午，錦興茶館就是喧騰騰的進出着絡繹不絕的足踪，一直至傍晚始稍靜寂下來。</p>
<p>人一多，聲音跟着嘈雜異常，面對而說話幾乎不能聽淸晰，非把腔子提高不可，於是空氣更加緊張而騷亂。人全像具有一顆來到此地需要盡情開懷，暢所欲言的心，人都是那樣勁兒濃，愉快。</p>
<p>烟霧和水蒸氣佈滿四週，弄得有人嗆着咳嗽，有人眼眶流淚水。堂倌允其是忙的不可開交，這也要加水，那邊也要東西，依然應接不暇，於是這個嚷着快點，那個也嚷着快點。這時候有不能形容的得意的表情坐在櫃檯上的李老闆，只好走下來帮帮忙。</p>
<p>日昇伯抽着旱烟斗，瞧李三爹走近來，羨慕似的笑開了兩邊黃色的牙床：</p>
<p>——哈哈！三爹，生意眞好！</p>
<p>三爹是不止最先來同時是最末離去的一人，等到他走的時候，茶館中才讓一片寂靜佔據着。地上是亂七八糟地堆滿了瓜子殼，花生米的衣。</p>
<p>伙計在打掃，李三爹則在淸算進帳祗消那一隻五尺多高，碗面般大的竹筒，銅錢盈盈盛滿到洞口，便够呌他不知怎樣喜悅，晚上高興地多喝些白玫瑰的</p>
<p>靠一爿空空洞洞的茶館，養活一家七八口子，居然尙有餘裕，是誰也想不到的事，村裏的人都稱羨着。</p>
<p>日子過了一大堆以後，情形可可漸漸不同了。</p>
<p>午後，太陽還是從前的太陽，也還照例的射到錦興茶館的舖面上，李三爹也照例坐在　檯裏，可是笑的時候少，縐着眉的時候多，主顧一天比一天蕭條，起初他以爲是價錢貴，，便極力降低，而結果喝茶的人仍是越來越稀，生意步步壞。於是他辭掉了伙計，祇留着一個學徒和自己，但成日裏祇有零零落落了的幾個人沒事做，閒得慌。</p>
<p>至於日昇伯却還例外的依舊每天到來。而前些時和日昇伯一樣的人則久久不見來了。看到那光景，想起以往的狀况，日昇伯會慨嘆地說道：</p>
<p>——年頭不好，日子難過，連幾個喝茶錢都得省下了。</p>
<p>聽者，李三爹無話可答，祇報以苦怨的眼色。</p>
<p>像街面上其他店舖子同樣，曾經一度興隆的錦興茶館從此是逐漸衰落起來。</p>

<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>家啊，家啊，甜蜜的家啊。</p>
<p>沒有地方比家還可愛的了，</p>
<p>沒有地方比家還可愛的了。　—歌謠。</p>
<p>昏暗的天，緊繃着沒有光亮的愁臉。而且又哭起來了。淚水一行行地掛下來。——這時候，天落着雨。</p>
<p>兩個靑年的小夥子，一同拐進了那個小酌館。在角落里坐了下去。……</p>
<p>堂倌端上了盤子，盤子冐若熱氣。當他們拿起筷的時候，雪也夾在雨中下着。像天空中掉下一朶朵的落花似的。</p>
<p>首先下箸的那個，把眼睛望到外邊，就若有所感地說，</p>
<p>「瞧，下雪啦。」</p>
<p>另外的一個回答了。</p>
<p>「我眞怕。一瞧見雪，就要想起家。——家鄉里的雪纔够味哩。這里不行，什麼都是不行的。只有人心，却比我們那邊兒要冷得多了。」</p>
<p>打頭說話的那人，高個兒，頭髮是蓬亂的，蒼白的臉色，帶點憂鬰的樣子。仰起腦袋朝上望了望，隨着便說，</p>
<p>「是哪，我也不明白這里的一些人，爲什麼他們的日子老是過得這樣地昏沉沉的。——」</p>
<p>「不然的話，你敎他們怎樣呢！」</p>
<p>「難道就這樣算了嗎？」高個兒的憤然地把這句問話來對付那一個了。那人把肥壯的軀體搖晃了一下。</p>
<p>「可是，他們能做些什麼啊。」</p>
<p>高個兒的像給這話感動了似的，沉默着了。</p>
<p>風把幾朶雪花吹進來。在靠近舖門口的地板上，就多了幾滴水沫。人們的脚踐踏下去，就愈加顯得潮濕和汚穢了。——這里的雪永遠沒有北國的偉大的。南方的雪眞是低能兒的啊。</p>
<p>那肥壯的一個又提高了嗓音來打破靜默了：</p>
<p>「起始，我初到這里的時候還算可以，在新聞紙上，我噙着眼淚去讀，在大街上，我跟游行的人羣去瞎跑。——</p>
<p>「有一回，大街上攘着人羣，形形色色的一大堆人啊，有一個沙嗓子熱烈地喊着，「歡迎民衆參加呀！」常時，我滿以爲……」</p>
<p>略略地頓了一下。又，</p>
<p>「那是多好的哪。我擠在人羣里邊，走着走着。彷彿在家鄉里的官道上走着似的。……瞧見一所小洋房，我就當作是我家的瓦屋，……我們一起兜了不少的路，後來不知在什麼路上，人羣就在那里散了。我懷着一顆熱烈的心，跑</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>回寓所，躺在床上，老是想着家，睡不合眼，就一直失眠到天亮。」</p>
<p>「——」</p>
<p>高个兒的沒有說話，只是那張蒼白的臉孔流虂着驚訝的神情。</p>
<p>那胖子又在唏噓起來了。</p>
<p>「現在呢，你看，家沒有了，第二的家又在那里呢？……」</p>
<p>太息着，憂傷地。</p>
<p>想起家哪，家鄕有着太多美好的東西，……堆積了白雪的山峯，結了冰的河流，……這樣的想着，兩對疲倦的眼光就凝住了啦。……</p>
<p>悄然地不做聲了。沈默又像烟靄般的瀰漫開來。</p>
<p>天暗了。黃昏躡足地走到了。他把大手遮住天空。他是嫉妒白天的，所以，繼有這樣的工作。然而這對于他，也是徒然的事呢。——黑夜也要接踵　來了，不久，他也要給人家呑沒的。</p>
<p>外邊兒——</p>
<p>依然，是雨水追逐着雪花，雪花追逐着雨水。</p>
<p>而且，還帶點兒風。——閉上眼睜，悄靜的，就可以聽到雨雪的滴瀝聲中，風在嗚咽着。</p>
<h3 id="c235">寂寞 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 志遠</p>
<p>寂寞，不可抵抗的寂寞，像供水一般向我襲來。</p>
<p>在我這屋子裏，除了自已便沒有動物的生命，只有幾棵植物的生命：兩盆掛在橫樑下的鳳尾草，兩盆文竹，其中一盆多半幾無生存的希望，一盆還掛着去冬的枯花的梅，抽着幾片嫩綠。我對於屋子裏的生命的伴侶有着無限的好感與愛心。每天晚上我可以自已忘記醫生關照我應做的事，却從不忘記這兩盆鳳尾草所應得的兩盆清水。它們在我這屋子裏感到安適而放心，我想。它們抽着嫩芽，渐渐地垂下綠色的蒂，差不多可以並着書架的最底一層了。並且出奇的，竟居居然開出白色的三瓣小花。那樣白，那樣小，躱在繁密的綠葉子後面，連我也沒有注意到。到我見着的時候，已經有幾朶寂寞地萎了，這樣寂寞的自開自落，使我受很大的感動。對於文竹，我也有最大的期望與小心去侍候。聽說它要喝牛奶，我便央隣人把喝完牛奶的空瓶洗下一點水來灌漑它。這樣，垂死的西株，讓我救活了一株。有嫩芽了。一天早晨我發現這書桌上的一盆有半寸綠色淡得發白的新枝；我驚喜，這生命的消息。這新芽長得異常的快，我拿旁邊一條舊枝的節作尺寸，每天晚上都可以見到這柔嫩而豊滿，微微曲向陽光的枝尖，指到它身旁舊枝的更高一節去。過兩天又有一個新芽衝出土層，用同樣的姿態與速率向陽光伸長它的生命。</p>
<p>我設着，假如我此刻被監禁在牢獄裏，而且只是一個人，祗要有這麼一點綠色的生命伴着我，祗要我能用自己生命的原料去完成另一個生命，我將喜悅，歡欣而且歌舞。</p>
<p>我的境况比監禁在牢獄裏好得多，而且已有綠色的生命伴着我。但是我寂寞。不可抵抗的空虚，像洪水一般向我襲來。</p>
<p>在早晨，橘黃色的太陽射到眼皮上，有童年時代鬧着玩兒擠着橘皮上的水分射到眼皮上的酸澀感覺。晨曦的色彩看不可測的迅速：橘黃瞬息變成金黃，接着是一串有金属聲的鴿铃。由那鈴聲的旋動抑陽，我可以想象着背負金黃色早陽的鴿　，在我的屋頂上她們上下盤旋的舞姿連結成一座寶塔。鈴聲速了，我知道她們已完成了塔尖，升了更高的遠空，把她扔在底下縱容我的幻想。我於是蓮然坐起：寶塔原來不也是一種墳墓麼？</p>
<p>然而連墳墓也是空虛的，寂寞的呵。</p>

<p>Tianjin: A Japanese military spokesman said today, regarding the increase of Japanese troops in North China, that compared with other countries, the existing strength of the Japanese garrison in China is disproportionate to the number of Japanese residents in China. He also said that Japanese investment has not yet gone beyond the discussion stage and is currently limited to small loans to farmers. However, bandits and communists in southern Hebei are posing as farmers, so the authorities are finding it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake farmers. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Legislative Yuan Holds Meeting to Amend the Articles of the Regulations on the Reclamation of Land by Convicts Serving Sentences <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Legislative Yuan held its 48th meeting on the morning of the 21st. Sixty-three members, including Yang Gongda, attended. Sun Ke chaired the meeting, and Liang Hancao served as secretary-general. The meeting passed an amendment to Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations on the Reclamation of Land by Convicts Serving Sentences. The amended text reads: "The implementation measures for the reclamation of land by convicts shall be determined by the Judicial Yuan in conjunction with the Executive Yuan." According to the original article, "The Executive Yuan shall determine it alone." Since the reorganization of the Ministry of Judicial Administration under the Judicial Yuan, the words "Executive Yuan" in the article should have been changed to "Judicial Yuan." However, given that the regulations on military convicts still require the military to order their transfer, and that the implementation of reclamation is closely related to administrative matters, the matter was changed to be jointly determined by the two Yuan in order to be appropriate and convenient. The meeting adjourned after the case was discussed. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Legislative Yuan's Legal System and Political Committees held a joint meeting after the Yuan meeting on the 21st to review and amend the organizational laws of the Ministry of Finance and its subordinate Customs, Salt, and Revenue Administrations. Over thirty members, including Shi Weihuan and Zhao Naichuan, attended. Wu Jingxiong chaired the meeting. The committee first heard reports from various preliminary review committees on the progress of the preliminary review. It was then stated that the preliminary review committee and representatives from the Ministry of Finance still had two main points of disagreement on the case: the merger of the Salt Affairs Audit Office and the Salt Administration, and the jurisdiction of the performance appraisal functions. The meeting requested that the joint meeting decide on the direction of the amendment to provide a basis for following. It was then resolved to re-submit the case for review. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Central Standing Committee has approved the two principles of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law, which can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

It is said that it has been pre-determined that the case will first be submitted to the chairmen and secretaries-general of the five committees and over ten legislators for joint review, and then reported to the Yuan meeting for review.

<p>Nanjing: The Judicial Yuan has clarified the ambiguity in Article 975 of the Civil Code: if one party to a marriage agreement violates the agreement without a reason under Article 976 of the same law, they can only be requested to compensate for damages in accordance with Article 978 of the same law. Since their suit to enforce the marriage agreement is restricted by Article 975 of the same law, it should be rejected. This has been circulated to the courts of all provinces for their information.

<h3 id="e14">A Word for the National Lawyers' Community <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>The 7th National Lawyers Association Congress is being held in Shanghai, bringing together representatives from dozens of public organizations. The motions under discussion are numerous. The task of lawyers in the nation and society is to uphold justice, protect human rights, assist judicial organs, and consolidate the spirit of the rule of law. The gathering of this free profession has its own special significance. I would like to take this opportunity to say a word to the gentlemen of the lawyers' community.</p>
<p>Although the lawyer system in our country has been in place for several decades, the qualifications for lawyers in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China were strictly screened. Recently, the restrictions have been relaxed, and the number of law school graduates applying for lawyer certificates has gradually increased. Coupled with the underdeveloped nature of various social undertakings, most of those with lawyer qualifications register and perform their duties in major cities, creating a sense of excess in the lawyer community. In fact, the use of lawyers is not limited to litigation cases. Non-litigation matters are many times more numerous than litigation cases. If more attention can be paid to this, the services that lawyers can provide to society will be even greater.</p>
<p>When the country is in a period of transition, not only do the common people lack the concept of abiding by the law, but even those in power may not be able to uphold the law like a deity. If the judiciary cannot demonstrate its independent spirit and instead caters to and complies with the powerful and foreign forces, it will forfeit its national integrity, which is extremely painful. Therefore, we rely on righteous people in the legal community to rise up and correct right and wrong in the world, clarify the true meaning of the law, redress grievances, and suppress evil. The hinge of the country's survival is in this.</p>
<p>This congress has dozens of motions, some suggesting to the authorities, some encouraging themselves, some seeking changes in procedures, and some planning to consolidate legal rights. All of these come from the hardships and sweetness of daily experience. The aim is that each of the motions should not merely increase the archives, but also manifest in actions and be deeply and clearly evident.</p>
<p>Since the gentlemen of the legal community are determined to serve society, the foundation of everything should be based on morality. Those who study the law should not fail to take morality as their essence. The social changes and machinations are endlessly resourceful and require accumulated experience to cope with. Too rigid will break, too soft will bend. Wise and upright behavior will be appropriate.</p>
<p>How many sages and philosophers in the legal community of Europe and America have risen to govern the country? Now our country will transition from tutelage to constitutionalism. People from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors are not familiar with politics, and may not understand the law. If the representatives, in addition to performing their duties, examine the pain points of the people, study the gains and losses of the current politics, what legal aspects should be improved, and what social matters must be reformed, then the future of the country will truly depend on them.</p>

Mr. Liao, the head of the Guangxi Bank of the Gui Clique, arrived in Guangdong to meet with Sir Arthur Salter. The Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram on the 20th, opposing the connection of the Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways.

<p>Guangzhou: Sir Arthur Salter, the British government's economic advisor, arrived here this morning aboard the Taishan with his wife, the financial expert Mr. Younger from the Hong Kong government, and the acting commercial commissioner, Mr. Scott. Chen Jitang, Lin Yunge, and Liu Jiwen all sent representatives to welcome them. Sir Arthur and others are staying at the British Consulate in Guangzhou. After arriving in the province, they met with British merchants in Guangzhou to hear their opinions on the current state of British trade in South China. They then called on the leaders of the southwest region. The Chinese-language newspapers here have paid considerable attention to Sir Arthur's trip. The official newspaper, the Shimin Daily, editorialized that it hoped that Sir Arthur's work would not only help to unify China's currency, but also establish concrete methods to restore Sino-British trade in South China, because Sino-British trade has declined due to the dumping of Japanese goods, and will continue to decline in the future. Chinese public opinion generally believes that Sir Arthur will discuss with the authorities how to improve economic relations between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and study the general economic situation in Guangzhou. Due to Sir Arthur's arrival in the province, Chinese merchants are now actively promoting their opposition to the connection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appealed to the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department to reject the discussion of the railway connection issue, because the Chamber of Commerce believes that if the railway connection is implemented, Guangzhou will become a dead port. Chinese newspapers report that the rumor that Sir Arthur will visit Guangxi Province is inaccurate according to Reuters. Sir Arthur is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on Sunday. Chen Jitang and Lin Yunge are scheduled to host a banquet tonight to entertain him. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin experienced heavy snowfall all day on the 21st, accumulating over a foot, making transportation difficult. The situation for the ships trapped by ice at Dagukou is becoming increasingly critical. The Tianjin shipping industry held another meeting, appointing Wang Gengsan and Dong Haoyun to visit the Tianjin Customs Commissioner and the Director of the Haihe Engineering Bureau to request immediate rescue measures. It was decided that the two agencies would continue to rent the British icebreaker "Malara" and the Japanese icebreaker "奉天丸" to start work on the 22nd. On the 21st, due to the extreme cold, the submarine cable outside Dagukou was frozen and destroyed. The Tianjin Electric Bureau discussed hiring the Tianxing ship to break the ice and carry workers for repairs, but it was unsuccessful due to the thickness of the ice. Tianjin port's Shanghai and international telegrams were switched to landlines. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Regarding the freezing of Dagukou in Tianjin, the Tianjin shipping industry telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance, ordering Tianjin Customs to rescue the ice-trapped ships. There was still no reply on the 21st. The Customs Port Authority and the Haihe Engineering Bureau shirked responsibility, all claiming it was due to the weather and wind direction, and that it would thaw when it warmed up, and could not be rescued by human effort. Only after negotiations by the shipping industry on the 21st did they agree to rent British and Japanese icebreakers for rescue, with the expenses borne by the two agencies. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>A strong northeasterly wind is blowing in Tianjin, and the coast of North China is now frozen again. More than a dozen ships are trapped by ice outside Dagukou Bay, including ten Chinese merchant ships. The Chinese Shipping Association has appealed to the central government for relief. The thickest ice is said to be 40 feet thick, extending ten miles from Dagukou Bay, with ice floes 20 feet high and 120 feet long and wide. The Taikoo ships "Yuezhou" and another ship set off from Tanggu yesterday, traveling only two miles all day. Tugs are now planning to approach the trapped ships to provide supplies. If they cannot reach them, they will use coolies to transport food. One icebreaker disembarked a hundred passengers from a certain Japanese ship today, but due to the difficulty of navigation, it has not yet reached the shore. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Regarding the Dengkou dispute, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission previously sent Tang Kesan to Ningxia for mediation. After Tang arrived in Ningxia, he went to the Alxa Banner, but due to the deadlock between the two parties, he telegraphed the Central Government with the details of the incident, requesting instructions. There is currently no concrete solution. Tang is still in Ningxia. According to a certain important Mongolian figure in Beiping who received a telegram from Zasak Da Wang of the Alxa Banner, regarding the current dispute in the Banner, in the current environment, they do not want to cause a greater crisis over a small matter and hope for an early resolution. The Alxa Banner is vast and is located on the front line of national defense. More than a thousand Banner soldiers were previously trained to prevent the Communists, which has been quite effective. However, their funding is entirely allocated from the Guangxingyuan land tax. If the Ningxia Provincial Government also levies taxes in the area, the Mongolian people will not be able to bear this double burden. If the Ningxia Provincial Government can forgive the Alxa Banner's plight and allow the Guangxingyuan tax to be allocated to the Mongolian military expenses, the Dengkou dispute can be easily resolved.

<p>The Executive Yuan, under President Jiang, has issued a public notice to all officers and staff of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, urging them to abide by discipline. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Public Notice: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has the longest history and largest scale among shipping organizations in our country. However, due to poor management over the years, its business has declined and its debts have increased day by day. This continuous loss must be reversed. Since its nationalization in recent years, although it has been striving for better management, the results are still minimal. The Executive Yuan has decided to order the Ministry of Communications to reorganize the company, revise its organizational charter, and provide guidance on rectification methods, with the intention of eliminating corruption, eradicating the long-standing habits of embezzlement and perfunctory behavior, and implementing a thorough reform. Such measures should be understood and appreciated by those who understand the situation. All employees of the company, who have served for a long time and are familiar with the situation, should, if they have any insights on how to eliminate long-standing malpractices, improve business operations, and start increasing revenue and reducing expenditures, submit them to their superiors for consideration. If they do not follow the correct path, but stubbornly insist on their own opinions, or even succumb to the temptation of external malicious elements, sow discord, incite unrest, and affect the company's operations, the President of the Executive Yuan will regard this as a violation of discipline and disruption of transportation, and will severely punish them according to the law without any leniency. In addition, if employees of various branches, warehouses, and docks engage in such behavior, they will be dealt with equally. In addition to ordering the Ministry of Communications to earnestly supervise, quickly report on the rectification, this notice is hereby issued for public knowledge.

<p>London: Sir Jia Degan, the British Ambassador to China, has succeeded Sir Wellesley, who retired due to old age, as Deputy Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs. His vacant post will be filled by Sir Xu Zhisen, the British Envoy to Iran (Persia) since 1934, which has been approved by the British Emperor. Xu was born in 1886, studied at Oxford, and entered the diplomatic service in 1908. In January 1919, he served on the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. In the same year, he was promoted to First Secretary of the Foreign Office. From 1926 to 1930, he served as Counselor at the British Embassy in Belgium. From 1930 to 1934, he served as Envoy to several Balkan countries. After that, he was transferred to Envoy to Iran. He has one son and two daughters. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London: The new appointment of Sir Jia Degan was welcomed by The Times and the Daily Telegraph today. The Times stated that the Foreign Office would become more powerful as a result. The Daily Telegraph stated that Jia Degan served as the head of the League of Nations section for several years before becoming Ambassador to China. His promotion to Deputy Undersecretary of State shows not only his talent but also Foreign Secretary Eden's desire to pursue his League of Nations policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

They decided on Ambassador Arita's final fundamental attitude toward China policy, centered on the draft instructions he is carrying. Also, Foreign Minister Hirota, who is ill, summoned Ambassador Arita to his private residence in the afternoon to give instructions.

<p>London: Naval sources predict that the Naval Conference will conclude its work in the middle of next week. At that time, only a technical agreement will be initialed, and no treaty is likely to be signed. Even this technical agreement must be implemented after the current political negotiations conclude. The current difficulty lies in the issue of inviting Germany to sign and participate. The United Kingdom believes that the sooner the better, while France insists that air security and naval disarmament should be linked, and Germany can only be invited to participate after this principle is recognized. The United States still believes that naval issues are purely technical and should not involve political issues. These are the general attitudes of the three countries. As for the issue of battleship tonnage, it is unlikely to hinder the initialing of the agreement, because the current compromise plan, which sets the battleship tonnage at 35,000 tons but limits it to five years, is acceptable to all countries.

<p>Negotiations on Qualitative Restrictions Underway; Talk of Expanding the Scope of the Naval Conference</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of qualitative naval restrictions, the countries involved are currently conducting political negotiations. Once these negotiations are concluded, a new naval conference may be convened here, with the participation of the UK, the US, France, Italy, Germany, and Russia. The UK will contact Japan to invite its attendance, and if agreed, Japan will also participate in the conference. It was rumored yesterday that Italy would make the revocation of sanctions a condition for signing a future naval treaty. Naval officials here have mixed feelings about this news and will likely wait until the Italian representatives to the Naval Conference, Rainaldi and Piccia, return from Rome before the truth becomes clear.

<p>Washington: The French Ambassador to the United States, de Laboulaye, previously discussed the issue of battleship tonnage with Deputy Secretary of State Phillips. It is understood that the US government did not directly respond to de Laboulaye's proposals because the negotiations currently underway in London are friendly and seamless and will likely achieve a satisfactory resolution. The US government is keen to avoid anything that could cause misunderstanding and suggest that naval negotiations could be moved from London to Washington. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Committee of Experts Concludes Work; Methods for Qualitative Restrictions Agreed Upon</p>
<p>London: The General Committee of the Naval Conference previously appointed a subcommittee of experts to study the issue of qualitative restrictions on various warships (excluding battleships). The subcommittee has recently concluded its work and agreed on the following restrictions:</p>
<p>*   Aircraft carriers: 22,000 tons, with guns of 6-inch caliber.</p>
<p>*   Class A cruisers: 10,000 tons, with guns of 8-inch and 6-inch caliber.</p>
<p>*   Class B cruisers: 7,500 tons, with guns of 6-inch caliber.</p>
<p>*   Destroyers and light cruisers are classified as one category. Destroyers are set at 1,850 tons, with guns of 5-inch caliber.</p>
<p>*   Submarines: 2,000 tons, with guns of 4-inch caliber.</p>
<p>*   Other small warships, such as shallow-water defense ships, which were originally not subject to qualitative restrictions under the Washington Naval Treaty, will continue to be unrestricted in the future. However, countries will notify each other when constructing them. Also, the number of aircraft carried by various warships that are not classified as aircraft carriers will not be restricted. The definition of aircraft carriers remains the same as that contained in the Washington Naval Treaty, i.e., any vessel equipped with a flight deck and equipment to assist in the launch of aircraft will be considered an aircraft carrier. However, the current definition is more detailed. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>London: In the House of Commons today, there was questioning about newspaper disclosures regarding the British defense plan. Prime Minister Baldwin replied that the defense plan had not been leaked to the outside world. The information in the newspapers was only based on informed predictions and factual knowledge. He said that if he had the position and knowledge of an ordinary journalist, he could also write it. The defense plan will soon be announced in Parliament, which includes adjusting the working procedures of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and paying attention to the proper functions of these three departments in this procedure. However, any long-term procedure must be flexible and must be constantly modified as needed by the environment. As for the nature of the command, he was not prepared to elaborate until the defense debate. When a member asked about the increase in the purchase price of armaments, Baldwin replied that the air force procurement contract contains a purchase price clause, and this will continue to be followed in the future to prevent contractors from obtaining excessive profits in army and navy contracts. Baldwin also said that he would move on Monday to suspend discussion of other matters in the House of Commons to focus on debating foreign policy. He hoped that this debate could be completed by 9:30 p.m., and then consider the supplementary budgets for the Army, Navy and Air Force. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>London: Sir Moffat, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, was ordered last spring to study the interests of the United Kingdom in Abyssinia, as to how they would be affected by Italy's policy toward Abyssinia. He submitted a report, the contents of which have not been made public until yesterday, when an Italian newspaper published a summary. It is now known that Foreign Secretary Eden will make a statement to the House of Commons on Monday, commenting on the report. As far as this agency knows, the report only studies the Abyssinian issue from a number of perspectives. The full text is 12,000 words long and is marked "Secret" on the cover, with the words "Property of the British Government." Cabinet members, senior officials of the relevant departments, the British Embassy in Italy, and agencies in British territories in Africa who contributed opinions to the government each received a copy. It is generally believed that the attitude adopted by the United Kingdom toward Italy in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute does not contain any imperialistic notions. This is powerfully evidenced in Sir Moffat's report. Therefore, the Cabinet may decide to publish the original text of the report. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London: Government officials began investigating the truth today about how the Italian newspaper obtained the secret report of the Moffat Committee. They did not express outrage at the Italian newspaper's disclosure of this secret document, but merely stated that it was sufficient proof that the United Kingdom's demand for League of Nations sanctions against Italy had no selfish motives. A government spokesman said today that since the Italian Embassy Counselor in the UK, Vedetti, informed British officials on January 29 last year of the secret agreement between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and former French Foreign Minister Laval, the UK immediately appointed a committee to investigate the facts but not to make any recommendations. Subsequently, because the British Cabinet did not believe that Italy's aggression against Abyssinia would infringe on British interests, the report of the committee has not been adopted. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London: Today, members of the House of Commons questioned Prime Minister Baldwin about the Italian newspaper's publication of the secret report of the Colonial Office Undersecretary Moffat in June 1935, which stated the UK's attitude toward Italy's rights in Abyssinia and stated that Italy's actions in Abyssinia were not of major concern to British interests. Conservative Party member Churchill was eager to know how the London Office's affairs were leaked to the outside world. Labour Party member Lansbury said that if the House of Commons did not know all the facts before Monday, it could not debate foreign affairs. Baldwin replied that he was very busy this morning and had not read the newspapers, that he would pay attention to the matter, but could not answer at this time. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London: According to unofficial investigations today, the secret report of the British Colonial Office official Moffat, which was disclosed by the Italian newspaper in Rome yesterday, was actually obtained by Italy through improper means.

The Air Force is actively operating in the Eritrean front. There are no changes in the war situation in the southern Somaliland front. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Dessie: Ethiopian Minister of War General Muluceta today published an article denying the Italian claim of a major victory in the Magal Nan Amba Aradam area, stating that on February 12, he felt that the Italian army was about to launch a major offensive, so he retreated according to strategic orders. The advance troops of the enemy saw the Ethiopian army moving and immediately attacked, and a major battle began. From the 12th to the 17th, they repeatedly clashed. The Ethiopian side lost 147 dead and 268 wounded, while the enemy casualties far exceeded this number. On the night of the 16th, 1,500 Italian soldiers surrendered with weapons. The people of the Ethiopian capital were greatly relieved to see this communiqué, saying that the Ethiopian government's transportation was unfavorable and it could not quickly report the results of the war. The enemy had a large number of troops, and the Minister of War's command to retreat to avoid their ambush could be said to be appropriate. Now General Kassa is still communicating with the Minister of War and Dessie, indicating that transportation is unimpeded, which is enough to show the falsity of the Italian claim that the Italian army's advance has cut off the Ethiopian army in the Danbian area. At the same time, according to news from Harar, there is heavy rain in both Harar and Wogadén. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Paris - Former leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Herriot, spoke in the Chamber of Deputies today to defend the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, saying, "Regarding the collective security system, the interests of the Soviet Union are no different from ours. We must not judge the foreign policy of a country based on observations of its internal affairs. After the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, France's responsibility for Central Europe can be somewhat reduced, which is undeniable. Moreover, since the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, its representatives have cooperated in all the League's affairs. I am deeply convinced of its sincerity. As for France, it should remain loyal to the principles of arbitration, security, and disarmament, and never waver." Herriot then said that the French and Russian peoples should abandon their prejudices and be in harmony, saying, "The Soviet Union has a vast land and a large population, and there is ample room for intellectual development. As a humble descendant of the French Revolution, I sincerely hope that the two great revolutions of France and Russia will be harmonized. The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty does not harm or threaten any country. Its conclusion does not go beyond the scope of the League of Nations, and it is also in line with the provisions of the Locarno Pact. Our responsibility in Central Europe can be eased, and the two great nations of France and Russia can be brought closer. This is why I ask the members of the Chamber of Deputies to pass it." After his speech, the Chamber immediately announced an adjournment and scheduled to continue the debate next Tuesday. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Chamber of Deputies met today to continue discussing the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. A Communist member, Doriot, stood up to speak, denouncing the dual policy of the Soviet government and the Third International as dangerous and sharply criticized it, moving the listeners. He said briefly that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty might drag France into a whirlpool of war, "and as a result, the Third International, for the sake of fomenting revolution, may abandon us midway and discard us like worn-out shoes. France is a democratic country, and its policy is based on the Treaty of Versailles and the collective security system. The Soviet Union, since its founding by Lenin, has called for world revolution, which is a unique country. The Soviet government and the Third International are two in one, although they have different names, the power is in one hand. Those who manipulate this dual policy are far-sighted and difficult to fathom. The political systems of France and Russia are contrary to each other, and the national conditions are different. One intends to destroy the other's social system. How is it possible to force them to connect and conclude such a treaty? We really cannot understand. "Doriot then described the changes in Soviet policy since German leader Hitler came to power, saying that the Soviet Union regarded National Socialism as a great enemy of the Soviet system, so it reversed its previous diplomatic position and turned to using the antagonism of the imperialist countries such as France and its allies towards National Socialism to confront Germany. The Soviet Union simply took advantage of the fact that the defeated countries in the European War changed their political systems, and immediately put itself in the ranks of the victorious countries to exclude these defeated countries. This plan is enough to cause war," and so on. (Note: Doriot was originally one of the leaders of the French Communist Party. In May of the previous year, he advocated uniting the Socialist Party to resist Fascism, which led to conflicts with the Third International and the French Communist Party cadres. He then united with some party members to form an independent Communist Party.) (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>Paris - According to news obtained by the Morning Post's correspondent in Rome, the Polish Ambassador to Italy, Wyszynski, held talks with Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon, and then spoke with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck on the phone, and then set off for home that evening. Diplomatic circles in Rome believe that since German Aviation Minister Goering is now in Warsaw, and German Ambassador to Italy, Hassell, has also been travelling between Rome and Berlin recently, and Wyszynski returned home at this time, the significance of this is quite intriguing. It is heard that when Prime Minister Mussolini of Italy met with German Ambassador Hassell and Polish Ambassador Wyszynski, he informed them of Italy's views on the Danube River issue. When Italian Foreign Minister Suvich met with Austrian Foreign Minister Weikersheim in Florence some days ago, he also explained this view. This is the reason for the sudden increase in diplomatic activity between Italy, Germany, and Poland recently. However, it is limited to issues related to Europe. The two issues of the redistribution of mandated territories and Germany's external economic expansion, which are wider in scope, do not seem to have been touched upon.

<p>Moscow - Railways will soon be built between the Soviet Union and Iran (i.e., Persia), from the capital of the Armenian state in southeastern Soviet Union, Yerevan, to the city of Tabriz in Iran, so that the two countries can be directly connected by rail. In the future, the line will be extended from Tabriz to the Iranian capital to develop transportation between the two countries. Currently, those who go to Iran must hire vehicles in addition to taking the train, which is extremely inconvenient. In the future, when new roads are built, the width of the tracks, whether in the Soviet Union or in Iran, will be standardized so that people can travel directly back and forth without having to change trains at the border between the two countries. According to the Imperial Russian era, the Russian government never allowed the width of its tracks to be the same as those of other European countries. There were various reasons for this. The most important reason was that in the event of war, it would be difficult for foreign troops to use the railway to enter the country. (Havas Telegraph Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Tokyo - The opening of the vote counting for the fourth general election, reflecting the general will of the people, was held simultaneously at 8:00 a.m. today. The vote counting was completed today. The results have been determined for 62 districts, with 239 elected representatives. Partial vote counts have been conducted in 54 districts, and the remaining 122 districts will also be completed by the morning of the 23rd. (Dentsu dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - In the first day's election vote count, many new faces from the Minseito Party and the proletarian parties were crowned, while the opposition Seiyukai Party was in a difficult position, extremely pessimistic. However, the districts where the votes were counted on the first day were originally the city centers where the Minseito Party had an advantage. Therefore, the results as of 5:30 p.m. show that the Minseito Party had 51 seats, the Seiyukai Party 29, and the Shakai Taishuto 12. If the vote counting in the counties on the 22nd cannot show an unexpected turnaround, the old dream of the Seiyukai Party being the largest party may be shattered. However, the difference in the number of seats for the so-called largest party is very small. At this point, the highest number of votes obtained was by proletarian party member Kato Kanju, with more than 53,000 votes, which is attracting widespread attention. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - As of 11:00 p.m. on the 21st, the number of representatives elected from each party is as follows:</p>

<p>Tokyo - The results of the general election, which began counting votes at 8:00 a.m. today, are gradually becoming clear under the attention of the entire nation. However, during the vote counting, unexpected waves were stirred up in various places by the progress of the proletarian parties, which is enough to disrupt the existing party lineup. They have been obtaining the highest number of votes everywhere. Although it is not yet a problem in terms of the total number, the victory of these new faces from the proletarian parties is quite unexpected. Therefore, many former members of the Seiyukai and Minseito Parties have been defeated, which is quite noteworthy. As for the struggle between the Seiyukai and Minseito Parties, in the 62 districts with 239 seats where the vote counting ended in the first ten days, the Minseito Party slightly dominates. The vote counting in the county districts will be held tomorrow. It is still difficult to predict whether it will be a victory for the Minseito Party or whether the opposition parties will maintain their existing strength.

The cabinet will also compensate for the illegal treatment received by civil servants under previous governments, and hopes that the amnesty decree will be issued soon. In conclusion, he said, "We sincerely hope that all those who assist us in restoring the republican system will not disturb public order in the future, so as not to tarnish the victory we have achieved, even if the motive is pure, we must be cautious.

<p>Nanjing: The current regulations for county magistrate examinations stipulate that they should be held separately by province. The Ministry of Interior has sent a letter to the Examination Yuan requesting that they be held in accordance with the law, and the Ministry has consulted and determined two measures for these examinations. The order in which the provinces will hold the examinations will be determined by the Ministry of Interior based on the circumstances. The costs will be borne by the provinces holding the examinations. For remote or financially difficult provinces, the Ministry plans to request central government subsidies. The first measure has already been approved by the Examination Yuan, while the second measure has been resolved by the Central Political Council to change the examination expenses to be borne by the provinces holding the examinations, but financially difficult or border provinces may request appropriate subsidies from the central government. The National Government has issued orders to the Executive and Supervisory Yuans to comply. (February 21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>"Can ordinary people even get newspapers?" It was morning again, on the way back to my residence from Maying—the former site of the Ningxia Provincial Government—I saw a shop front piled high with fresh "large pancakes." This was a rare sight for us who had always lived in schools in the interior. We had already resolved to adapt to the northwestern lifestyle in order to get a real understanding of the situation. Therefore, we decided to have a northwestern-style breakfast today: buy a couple of scallion oil pancakes to fill our stomachs. I picked out a few of the steaming pancakes from the stall, made a small pile, and paid the money. But these greasy and spicy pancakes could not be eaten on the street. So I asked the pancake seller for a paper to wrap them in. I naturally thought that old newspapers would be the most suitable. "Do ordinary people in our homes even have newspapers?" This sentence, which seemed to be a well-reasoned argument, was the shopkeeper's way of refusing to provide a paper wrap. It turns out that the underdevelopment of the newspaper industry in Ningxia is undeniable. There is only one newspaper office, and the daily circulation is small. Besides government agencies, only a very few people subscribe. So, newspapers are naturally not found in ordinary people's homes. We could only sigh at the backwardness of northwestern culture.</p>
<p>"Come to Ningxia to marry a concubine." Due to the geographical environment, cultural development is lagging behind, the atmosphere is not yet open, and everything is immature. The education system is certainly no exception, especially women's education. There is only one girls' middle school in the entire city of Ningxia, offering junior high school and attached primary school. The number of students is also very small. Although students who enter the school are not only exempted from all tuition and miscellaneous fees, but also receive a monthly stipend of several dollars in addition to the supply of books, ultimately due to the closed atmosphere, parents stubbornly disapprove of their daughters showing their faces on the way to and from school. Poor families, although they do not have to spend money to attend school, are unwilling to leave their homes all day long. They still have to supplement some clothes and socks. They always want their daughters to help with some chores at home. They can also do some work that can earn a considerable profit. As for the girls who go to school, although many of them aim to seek knowledge, many of the students have other intentions. Doesn't entering school put them in the position of "female student"? "Female student," that's fashionable enough! The marriage problem is much easier to solve from then on. Therefore, as long as they succeed in marriage and find a satisfactory husband to rely on for life, they are willing to drop out of school. On the scale of their eyes, among the various occupations of agriculture, industry, commerce, military, politics, and police, they consider the figures mixed in the political arena to have the most important and highest status. Therefore, the ideal husbands of Ningxia women are mostly chosen from government employees. As long as the official position is high and important, they do not care whether it is a first marriage or a remarriage, and they are willing to be concubines even if they have a wife. It doesn't matter which wife they are, even if they are of questionable background, daughters from good families are still willing. Even after being deceived, divorced, or abandoned, they are willing to be deceived again. No wonder civil servants from other provinces all hold the view of "come to Ningxia to marry a concubine" and put this view into practice. This is truly a distorted phenomenon of women's education.</p>
<p>"Vow not to marry women with bound feet." In the past, the custom of foot binding was very prevalent among women in Ningxia. Foot binding is extremely inhumane and has a greater impact on the health of the nation. Recently, the educational authorities in Ningxia Province have also realized that this custom is bad and are promoting the natural foot movement. In addition to posting propaganda in the main thoroughfares to advise women and the public to unbind their feet, they also made a kind of armband with white cloth, red border, and black characters, rectangular in shape, printed with "Vow not to marry women with bound feet," and distributed it to unmarried primary and secondary school students throughout the city to wear. Sure enough, it was eye-catching and alerting. For the sake of their lifelong happiness, women's families and the women themselves have all implemented foot liberation. Therefore, in the provincial capital, you can no longer see girls under the age of fifteen or sixteen with small feet like the lotus steps of the past. This is a praiseworthy sight. It's just that among older women and in remote rural areas, the custom is still too strong, and there are still traces of bound feet staggering along.</p>
<p>A lifetime of three baths. "When a baby falls to the ground, the whole body is bathed for the first time. Only on the eve of the wedding night is the second bath performed. Afterwards, until death, the body bath at the time of encoffining is the third time. That is the last bath of life, and it is passive." An overseas Chinese businessman who has lived in Ningxia for many years told me the story of the locals "a lifetime of three baths." Perhaps it is an exaggeration, but it can also be seen that ordinary people do not pay attention to hygiene. Perhaps the climate has something to do with it. It is purely continental. The province is mostly desert, the air is dry, in the summer, dust accumulates on the streets, wind and dust fly. After washing clothes and body, they are immediately soiled again. Laziness is the nature of the northwestern people, so they simply let it go. Habit becomes nature. In winter, there is no rain but snow, and the wind is terribly cold. No one wants to expose their skin to wash. The common people are all draped in old sheepskin robes, felt shoes, and fur hats. The smell of scallions, garlic, and mutton emanates from their mouths and bodies. Thus, the lives of the locals are spent in this dirty environment all day long. Every day they lead donkeys, cows, or horses, perhaps camels, with goods on their backs, to the market to find their patrons.</p>
<p>Sleeping on a kang is like a smoking bed. Opium is one of Ningxia's products, even more important than fur. In the summer, in May and June, the fields are covered with all kinds of colorful flowers, that is the poppy season. Smoking opium has become an extremely common phenomenon in Ningxia. The production is high, the price is cheap. Except for Muslims who rarely have a liking for it, most families have a set of smoking equipment on the kang, and even replace fragrant tea with opium to entertain guests. In social gatherings, people in the middle and lower classes smoke even more. Men and women are equally qualified as "old guns." Poor laborers, whose homes are bare, but beyond the four walls, there is a smoking lamp. Sleeping on a kang is like a smoking bed. It is simply better to have no rice to cook than to have no smoke to live on. But once addicted to opium, the spirit is weakened, which also cultivates a lazy disposition and leads to panic in life.</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence. Jiangxi has suffered from economic decline and rural bankruptcy in recent years. All industries are in recession, and people's livelihood is withered, showing an unprecedented scene of panic. Nanchang City, the economic center of the province, has also seen commercial bankruptcy due to the people's lack of purchasing power. In the past year, the city was in a state of economic collapse that could hardly be contained. By the end of last year, more than 350 households had announced their closure and bankruptcy. It is feared that those managed by creditors, secretly closed, or in a state of suspended animation account for a quarter of the total.

<h3 id="e104">Hubei Province to Improve the Collection of Land Tax - Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Comply <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence. Land tax is the main source of local revenue, and the administrative expenses of all provinces depend on it. The quota for land tax collection in Hubei Province is 1,893,200 yuan, which is less than that of other provinces. However, the actual amount collected each year is only about 30% to 40%. This not only affects the provincial treasury but also makes it difficult to maintain county administrative expenses. The reasons for the shortfall are mostly due to the disorganized collection registers, the difficulty in reversing the deep-rooted corruption, and the negligence of the collecting officials in thoroughly improving the situation. Yang Yongtai, the chairman of the provincial government, previously received a telegram from President Chiang ordering a thorough improvement. He has already drafted reform measures and issued a notice to all county magistrates on the 20th, outlining four points to be strictly followed: 1. Eliminate embezzlement. The clerks' control over collection and embezzlement of taxes for personal gain has been a common problem with land tax. County magistrates often follow the old ways and do not think of reform, resulting in deeper and deeper malpractices. In the future, they must check the tax collected daily, audit the accounts, and carefully select collection personnel in accordance with the repeated orders of this government, and strictly implement performance appraisal to clear up accumulated malpractices. 2. Sanction the powerful. Local powerful households own a large amount of land and often regard not paying taxes as an honor. The bad habits have been passed down and are almost regarded as exemptions. Some even harbor others, openly resisting and secretly rejecting the tax collection. Collecting officials are either intimidated by their power and have many concerns, or are hindered by friendship and turn a blind eye, which is extremely detrimental to tax administration. They should strictly comply with President Chiang's telegram to severely sanction them to warn the cunning and stubborn. 3. Strictly pursue old debts. The amount of arrears in land tax in each county is very large. The number of arrears in land tax over the years should be cleared up quickly, and methods for urging collection should be formulated, deadlines should be set, and arrears households should be ordered to pay. If they fail to pay after the deadline, they will be arrested and pursued, or their property will be confiscated to offset the arrears tax to enrich the treasury. 4. Rectify the new tax. In collecting the new tax, each county often neglects the busy season due to the uncleared old tax, leaving it to be overdue. Year after year, there is no hope of collecting the full amount according to the quota. It is extremely important to thoroughly rectify the situation, so that the people can pay on time and achieve the goal of collecting the full amount according to the quota. It is also said that the above four points are aimed at improving collection and eliminating old malpractices. However, the collection affairs are extremely trivial and must be diligently investigated from morning to night in order to achieve results. The county magistrates must not hand over the affairs to their subordinates due to the complexity of the affairs, so that the collection affairs will gradually decline. It is hoped that they will correct their previous mistakes and thoroughly improve the situation. After this decisive telegram, this government will regularly and strictly assess the amount of land tax collected in each county. If there is any more procrastination, negligence of tax administration, or short collection, which is less than the proportion, it will be severely punished and will never be tolerated. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">A Perspective on Small Loan Offices in Nanjing - Loans Are Available to Those With Productive Capacity; More Than 350,000 Yuan Has Been Loaned Out <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence. The Nanjing Small Loan Office is an organization that is directly related to the common people. According to Yuan Shaoxian, the business director of the office, the situation of the office is very detailed. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>The driving force behind the establishment of the Nanjing Small Loan Office can be attributed to the Jin Cheng Bank. Zhou Zuomin, the general manager of the bank, believed that the existence of the bank must benefit the general society, but in essence, the common people rarely receive real benefits. Therefore, he volunteered to contribute 100,000 yuan. The Nanjing Municipal Government allocated 48,000 yuan, and the Capital Police Department allocated 2,000 yuan, making a total of 150,000 yuan as the loan fund for the office. It was established on December 3, 1934. The scope of the office's loans is limited to those who are engaged in small industrial and commercial businesses and lack capital. Therefore, only those who have productive capacity are given assistance. As for poor people who cannot make a living, such as beggars and disabled people, the office will absolutely not provide relief because this is a loan business, not a charitable business.</p>
<p>The nature of the loans is divided into seed loans, draught cattle loans, poor people's loans, and industrial and commercial loans. The first two types are all aimed at farmers. For seed loans, the procedures must be proven by the local township or rich farmers. It must be confirmed that there are several acres of land, and it must also be proven that the loan will indeed be used to purchase seeds and will not be used for other purposes. The amount of the loan ranges from a minimum of 40 cents to a maximum of about 10 yuan. A total of 4,166 households have borrowed 13,751.80 yuan. Draught cattle loans also require proof and a guarantee that the borrower will never sell the draught cattle. At the same time, after the loan is established, the loan office will brand the draught cattle as a mark. Even if it is sold in the future, it will be invalid once discovered. As of now, a total of 1,231 households have borrowed 23,220 yuan. The next is poor people's loans. The so-called poor people are those who have productive capacity but lack capital. The maximum limit is 5 yuan, with no interest, and must be repaid within five months. A total of 6,449 households have borrowed 3,178.00 yuan. Finally, there are industrial and commercial loans. These are aimed at those who are engaged in small industrial and commercial businesses. The amount of the loan ranges from 6 yuan to 200 yuan, and the interest is divided into four levels: 7% for 6 yuan to 20 yuan, 8% for 21 yuan to 50 yuan, 9% for 51 yuan to 100 yuan, and 1% for 101 yuan to 200 yuan. A total of 4,963 households have borrowed 285,045 yuan. In total, 16,810 households have borrowed 354,194.80 yuan, with an average loan of 21 yuan and 7 cents per household.</p>
<p>Regarding the loan procedures, the borrower must first fill out an application form, stating the amount of the loan, its purpose, the repayment period, etc., and submit it to the designated agent - the Autonomous Region Office - there are a total of eleven in the city. After a thorough investigation and evaluation, it is submitted to the office for approval. Then, the agent will notify the original borrower to complete the loan procedures, such as filling out a promissory note, having the guarantor stamp, etc. Finally, the money can be received in full. The repayment period is stipulated as one year, but if the borrower can repay in advance, they can do so at their convenience. There are several methods of repayment: fixed-term, installment, and flexible. The borrower can choose whichever method they prefer. A repayment statement is issued, stating the installment amount and the due date. The borrower goes to repay on time. In the past year, borrowers have been able to abide by their credit and rarely default. This is a great help to the promotion of the office's business and is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>What benefits can the existence of this office bring to the society? This is a question worth discussing. According to Mr. Yuan, at the end of the lunar year last year, about 30 to 40 stores in Xiaguan were on the verge of bankruptcy. Fortunately, they were helped by the office and were able to survive. According to the office's investigation, each borrower's household has an average of six or seven people, totaling more than 100,000 people. With a fund of 150,000 yuan, the amount of loans has reached more than 350,000 yuan. The number of beneficiaries is so large—accounting for one-tenth of the city's population—and on this point alone, the office has value in existing.</p>
<p>Large stores in Nanjing City, such as silk and satin shops, Western pharmacies, and restaurants, also frequently request loans from the office. The office staff once said, "You are large stores with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of capital. Why do you need to borrow money from a small loan office?" The answer is roughly this: Although the stores have a large capital, they have all used it to purchase goods, resulting in a lack of liquid cash and difficulty in turnover. The banks are unwilling to lend to the merchants. Because the stores are in urgent need of payment, they know that the small loan office cannot lend much, but being able to borrow 200 yuan can help them overcome the current difficulty. Finally, they also ask to keep it a secret because it relates to the store's reputation and face. If this news is leaked, it will inevitably suffer from the influence of squeeze and cause shake.</p>
<p>In addition, because of the need to purchase goods, they must raise a large sum of money, so they also come to the office to ask for help. What is the state of financial exhaustion in the Nanjing market? Here, we can get a very definite answer.</p>
<p>The office recently plans to increase its fund by 50,000 yuan due to the development of its business, bringing the total to 200,000 yuan. It is said that it will be realized soon. At that time, it can further increase the loan efficiency of the office to exert its greatest effect.</p>

<p>There are no fewer than several hundred tofu shops in Suzhou, and they have an association as one of the members of the Chamber of Commerce. Recently, due to the impact of rising raw material prices, all the shops have felt it difficult to maintain their businesses. Therefore, they convened a general meeting of members on the 21st and resolved to raise the prices of all goods uniformly. It was also resolved that all businesses in the city would be closed for one day on the 22nd for reorganization. From the 23rd, the price increase will be implemented. The matter was reported to the party and government agencies for record and sent to the County Chamber of Commerce. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce stated that the reasons for the price increase were not clearly stated, and it was a matter related to the daily needs of the common people. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the association, urging them to carefully deliberate and make a decision before replying.</p>

<p>Recently, bandits have been rampant. Robberies and assaults are frequently heard in the four rural areas of the county. In the Lingyandang shoal area near Ganlu Town in the 8th district of the county, there is a man named Yin Qichang, who is over seventy years old, and his wife is also old. They both drive a small boat and make a living by fishing there. They are usually diligent and thrifty, so they have accumulated more than 700 yuan. Unexpectedly, they were targeted by bandits. At about 10 p.m. the other day, more than a dozen bandits suddenly rushed onto the boat, each holding iron rods and short knives, and tied up the Qichang couple, threatening them to make no noise. They searched arbitrarily, and more than 700 yuan in legal tender and foreign currency hidden in the bottom of the cabin were robbed. The hull of the boat was also damaged. The bandits then left with a roar. When it was dawn, they were discovered by others, and the Qichang couple was untied. However, the bandits had long since fled.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that the silkworm rearing results in various counties last year were excellent and the export of raw silk was active. It is expected that farmers will have a strong interest in silkworm rearing this year, and the orders for planting in various counties have increased sharply. The mulberry leaves will not be enough to distribute. Therefore, personnel were sent to Zhejiang to purchase more than 100,000 excellent mulberry seedlings. The silkworm mulberry model area of this county has received 80,000 branches and distributed them to various central guidance stations for silkworm farmers to purchase and plant. The cost of each branch is 1.3 cents. The amount needed for spring planting in the four rural areas of this county is expected to be more than 300,000 sheets. Currently, more than 172,500 sheets have been ordered, and 70,000 sheets of Japanese species ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Management Committee have been transported to Wuxi. This county can allocate 30,000 sheets according to the previous year's plan.</p>

<p>In order to develop its business and increase passenger convenience, the Jiangnan Long-Distance Bus Company has specially negotiated a through transport contract with the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration. Currently, the Railway Administration has stipulated that Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai North Station are through transport stations. The company has stipulated that Xueyanqiao, Caoqiao, Heqiao, Yixing, Xushe, Liyang, Huangdu, Changxing, and other eight major stations are through transport stations. Through tickets are sold. Wuxi Station is the connecting station. The contract can be formally signed soon, and it will be implemented in mid-March.</p>

<p>At the end of last year, robbery cases occurred frequently in the suburban villages of Muzhuang, Mochen, and Donggangjing in this county, but they have not been solved. Detective Gu of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team stepped up the investigation and obtained information. On the 19th, Wang Er, a major suspect in a series of robberies, was captured in Zhabei, Shanghai. Subsequently, Sang Genyun and Xu Gengsong and three other suspects were arrested in Hengjing, and a large number of stolen goods, worth about a small boat, were seized from Sang Genyun's home. The entire group was dispatched when the crime was committed. It is estimated that they robbed a certain surname's Yaojiadian three times, as well as the Tang surname's store, the Lu surname in Ouqu Town, the Chen surname in Jiangjinbang (and injured the owner), the Wang surname outside Xiaodongmen, the Li surname on the Donghu shore, and the Chen surname in Gezhuang. The leader is still living in a certain place in Shanghai, and news is communicated from time to time. According to the confession, the team sent personnel to Shanghai with informants to assist in the arrest of the remaining suspects, who will be handed over to the judiciary for investigation.</p>

<p>Ping Chucai, the chief of the fifth district of this county, has been in office for more than a year. The county government dismissed him because he was perfunctory in his work and did not obey public orders. Recently, he did not achieve any results in the registration of smokers. It has also been found that he himself has bad habits, so he was resolutely dismissed. His vacancy is temporarily filled by Gu Shoutian, who was appointed by the county.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Afforestation Movement Committee was organized and established a few days ago. A meeting was once held to discuss the afforestation methods for this year. It is said that the general decision is to plant trees in the area around Juhuashan near Zhulin Temple in the southern suburbs, covering an area of more than 1,000 acres of forest land. Because it is located in the scenic area of the provincial capital, the tree seedlings used will be mainly fruit trees. The funding has been determined to be 1,500 yuan, which is only half of last year's amount. Therefore, this year's afforestation, all party, government, military, police, schools, and groups will go together on March 12, and will no longer be held on separate days. The afforestation areas for all sectors are currently being divided.</p>

<p>Zhu Tinghua, the second son of Zhu Lüshi, a resident of the sixth troop tenth household of Sanbao Town, Shuangzhong County, Yangzhou (age thirteen), was studying at a private school across from the Dongquanmen Cloth Industry Guild. He suddenly disappeared on the 13th. Searches were fruitless. Unexpectedly, he returned home on the afternoon of the 18th. According to him, on the morning of the 13th, he was relieving himself in a small outhouse made of a charcoal basket when a strong man wearing a fur coat over a gray mandarin jacket suddenly appeared and knocked him down. He lost consciousness and only knew that he was running with the man. They went out of the city and boarded a boat where he was confined to the bottom of the hold, which was weighted down with large stones. He was taken to Zhenjiang, and given only two pieces of bread per day. When he needed to relieve himself, the boat would go into the middle of the river. The next day, he heard crying from the rear hold, realizing another child had been brought. The child was calling for his mother and was beaten severely. After noon on the 18th, all was silent. He secretly investigated and found no one around. He struggled with all his might and overturned the stones, escaping the hold and freeing the child from the rear hold. He learned that the child had been abducted from Nanjing, his father was a battalion commander, and he had an aunt in town. His own small fur coat had been taken from him. They decided to flee together. They saw a rope tied to the bow of the boat, very far from the shore. He braved the danger and climbed the rope to shore. The other child went to find his aunt, while he ran to the steamship bureau, recounted his abduction, and received a free ticket, enabling him to return to Yangzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Minister of Finance Proposes, Striving for Production and Construction Plan, Approved by the Central Political Council and Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Distribution to Various Ministries for Implementation Measures to be Submitted Within One Month <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Xin Xin News Agency reports that at the beginning of his tenure, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi convened a financial meeting to discuss major policy issues, such as abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, reducing and exempting surcharges on land taxes to benefit the people's livelihood, implementing a balanced tax to prevent the outflow of silver, and implementing the legal tender policy. He advocated the path of self-reliance to adjust finances and revive the nation. His painstaking efforts, determination, and far-sighted vision have long been recognized by the people of the country. The "Striving for Construction" proposal he put forward at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, including plans for various avenues to develop people's livelihood and strive for construction, was extremely comprehensive. It is reported that the case has been discussed and resolved by the Eighth Meeting of the Central Political Committee, passed according to the review opinions of the Economic Expert Committee, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for distribution to the Ministries of Interior, Industry, Finance, Railways, Communications, Foreign Affairs, and Education, with a deadline of one month for submitting implementation measures. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency specially excerpted the original proposal as follows:</p>
<p>Strive for Self-Salvation</p>
<p>I believe that the path to saving the country has countless aspects, but the fundamental point lies entirely in the government and the people striving for self-salvation. Since the establishment of the National Government, we have followed the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and worked hard to unify internally. After years of hard work, banditry has gradually been suppressed. When the banditry was at its height, the country was in turmoil, almost unmanageable. Thanks to the military and political authorities and the people of the whole country unanimously resisting with perseverance, the work of stabilization was finally achieved. This is a clear and great verification of self-salvation, which we can take comfort in.</p>
<p>Implement Economic Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>In recent years, floods and droughts have occurred frequently, leaving scars everywhere. The national rural areas are declining, and industry and commerce are shrinking. Domestic production is decreasing daily, and the huge trade deficit reaches 700 to 800 million yuan annually. Not only are industrial products dependent on foreigners, but even the required food cannot be self-sufficient. Economic collapse is imminent. The demise of the country can be expected at any moment. The plan for today is to thoroughly awaken, vigorously rejuvenate, and pledge to implement the policy of economic self-sufficiency with the spirit of national self-salvation. Gather the financial and human resources of the people of the whole country, concentrate them on economic construction, base them on a definite plan, and succeed in completing the plan within a set period.</p>
<p>Government Establishes Definite Plans</p>
<p>Our country has vast land and abundant resources. Its natural productivity is no less than that of European and American countries. The key to utilizing natural forces to seek advancement in production lies in diligent perseverance, strong will, and astute planning. The key is to not rely on others but to focus on self-reliance. Soviet Russia and Italy are even more barren than our country, but one implements a five-year plan and the other promotes a self-sufficiency policy. Both rely on the diligence and self-improvement of their people, tightening their belts, and focusing on production, finally leading their countries to prosperity. Japan is a small country with poor people, but through the hard work and struggle of its people, it has also been able to establish itself as an industrial and commercial nation and dominate the world. Although these countries use different methods, they all succeeded through self-salvation. Our country is in the midst of fierce global economic competition. The government should establish a production and construction plan, supervise and encourage the people to advance rapidly, so that the situation of collapse can be reversed.</p>
<p>Principles of Production and Construction</p>
<p>Production and construction have many aspects, but the phrase "utilize the land to its fullest, utilize people to their fullest, and utilize resources to their fullest" can encompass everything without omission. "Utilizing the land to its fullest" means not only making fertile soil and land suitable for planting to fully utilize its benefits, but also finding ways to improve and trial-plant barren and saline areas that everyone considers abandoned land, to achieve the goal of increasing production. "Utilizing people to their fullest" means not only allowing those with skills to each find their place, and giving idle people jobs, so that there is not a single person in the country who lives without working, but also using one person to do the work of two, and completing the work of two days in one day, so that consumption is reduced and production is increased, achieving the greatest effect at the lowest cost. "Utilizing resources to their fullest" means not only making sure that the treasures of mountains and seas are not abandoned, and that bamboo heads and wood chips are all suitable for use, but also transferring useless uses to useful uses, and transferring uses with less profit to uses with more profit, so that the power of production becomes more expansive, and its benefits become more widespread. The above are the principles of production and construction. The detailed outline of methods is summarized below:</p>
<p>Emphasize Production Education</p>
<p>Primary and secondary education is the foundation of education and is of great importance to people's lives and the survival of the country. Now that we are striving for production and construction, the direction of education should naturally be aimed at production. All primary and secondary school courses should focus on teaching students knowledge and skills related to production, and provide them with ample opportunities for practice, so that after leaving school, they can independently earn a living, directly increase production efficiency, and indirectly cultivate people's habits of self-reliance.</p>
<p>Concentrate People's Power</p>
<p>Our country has always emphasized etiquette and culture. Daily social interactions and funeral ceremonies cost a lot, consume useful money, and cultivate wasteful habits. It is appropriate to improve them. It is proposed to stipulate restrictions on various ceremonies such as weddings, birthdays, funerals, and sacrifices, and on gifts and banquets, specifying standards and not allowing abuse. Violators will be punished. Efforts should also be made to promote thrift and savings, so that they can be used for production undertakings. Furthermore, our country's temples and ancestral halls own a lot of property, most of which is used for consumption. This not only hinders production but also fosters a culture of living without working among the people. It should be stipulated by law that all folk temple and ancestral hall properties should be utilized as much as possible, with a portion used to run production undertakings and a portion transferred to support old age, care for orphans, and educational public welfare purposes. Local governments should strictly investigate and provide appropriate rewards and encouragement. It is proposed that the Ministries of Interior and Finance review the measures for implementation.</p>
<p>Guarantee Bank Credit</p>
<p>Since the global economic panic, financial tightening in various countries has greatly affected all industries. Even the United States, with its vast capital, implemented emergency measures, and the government's assistance to banks gradually led to stability. Our country's banks have weak capital and unsound organizations, and industrial and commercial enterprises urgently need access to funds to develop. If the government does not strongly support the banks, allowing them to invest in various industries with peace of mind, they will collapse immediately if they encounter risks. In the future, it is planned that the government will provide appropriate guarantees for the legitimate use and safekeeping of funds of various banks, and instruct them to provide low-interest loans to agricultural and industrial enterprises. The government will provide appropriate subsidies for the loss of interest. In this way, the financial foundation can be consolidated, and the development of industries can be expected.</p>
<p>Promote Labor-Management Cooperation</p>
<p>In industrialized countries, labor and management have become separate classes, and the struggle between them is fierce, which is detrimental to both. Our country follows Sun Yat-sen's teachings and establishes the country on the basis of the Three Principles of the People, so there should be no class struggle. However, factories are now in their infancy, and labor unions are gradually developing. In order to prevent labor disputes and maintain the healthy development of industry, the government should adopt a labor-management coordination policy, protecting both labor and management without partiality. Employers should provide employees with appropriate wages and adequate facilities, and employees should work diligently for employers to increase production efficiency. The two sides should understand and assist each other, each doing their best, and production can be increased, and costs can be reduced. This will not only promote international trade but also invisibly eliminate labor-management disputes. Therefore, all laws and regulations regarding working hours and wage standards that are not appropriate in the current laws and regulations should be revised to be feasible. At the same time, attention should also be paid to labor arbitration, labor insurance, vocational education, and labor-management consumer cooperation. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industry carefully discuss and implement these matters.</p>
<p>Advocate Running Heavy Industry</p>
<p>Heavy industry is the mother of all industries, and its importance is almost above all other industries. In the Material Construction section of Sun Yat-sen's The International Development of China, Sun proposed that counties establish factories to manufacture agricultural implements, etc., with the intention of being thorough. Furthermore, in the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, full efforts were devoted to the establishment of the machinery industry, placing light industry in a supporting position, so that it was able to establish an industrial foundation, and production consequently increased rapidly. Our country's light industry has been in its infancy recently, but the required machinery and metal raw materials are mostly purchased from foreign countries, and the industry has lost its independence, resulting in being controlled by foreigners, and the future is worrying. Therefore, for the sake of industrial development, special attention should also be paid to China. On the one hand, the state should operate selective industries, and on the other hand, it should encourage people to invest in and run industries. Existing private heavy industries with achievements should be helped to expand. Perhaps in five or ten years, production tools can be self-sufficient. The Ministry of Industry is requested to determine the methods and proceed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Promote Industrial Rationalization</p>
<p>Domestic industries have shown slight progress in recent years, but mostly due to improper management, poor technology, or other shortcomings, the cost is too high to compete with foreign goods, and many have been closed down. The competent authorities should investigate domestic factories and carefully assess them. If any of the above circumstances exist, they should be ordered to improve, or managed on their behalf, or ordered to reorganize thoroughly, so that they tend to rationalize, so as to reduce costs and increase production, to support national production and facilitate sales. The detailed plan is requested to be carefully drafted by the Ministry of Industry and submitted for implementation.</p>
<p>Promote Cottage Industry</p>
<p>Our country has attached importance to both men farming and women weaving since ancient times. For example, most of the domestic coarse cloth is produced by women's spinning and weaving. Since the import of foreign yarn, this industry has been abandoned, and women at home are sitting idle and doing nothing, learning to be extravagant, only knowing how to consume and not produce. Even in various places, there are businesses engaged in making hairnets, lace, and embroidery, and selling their products abroad, the scope is very narrow, and most of them are controlled by foreigners, and the results are still small. It seems appropriate to promptly formulate measures to encourage cottage industries and supervise people to organize cottage industry cooperatives to operate jointly to achieve great results. In this way, unemployed men and women at home can all use small industries to support themselves, which increases production power and fosters a habit of thrift. It is proposed that the Ministries of Industry and Interior review the implementation measures.</p>
<p>Utilize Waste Land</p>
<p>According to expert statistics, China has no less than 4 billion mu of arable land, but only 1.5 billion mu are currently cultivated. There is idle land and people, and production is shrinking, resulting in the need to rely on foreigners for daily food and industrial raw materials. The plan for today is to not only improve the cultivated land as much as possible to increase production, but also to investigate the wasteland and supervise its utilization. If it belongs to private individuals and is not reclaimed within three years, or if it is not effective within five years, it should be confiscated by the state. If it belongs to the state, a wasteland reclamation agency should be jointly established by the central and local governments to engage in land reclamation, or to conscript migrant workers and incorporate them into soldiers to provide service. Even for barren land that is not suitable for cultivation, it is appropriate to learn from Italy's example of opening up mountain gaps and planting grapes for winemaking, selecting varieties according to local conditions, and planting them separately. The detailed plan is requested</p>
<p>International Trade Balance</p>
<p>to be jointly drafted by the Ministries of Industry and Finance. Over the years, our country has had a large trade deficit. If the leaks are not stopped, there is no way to survive. The plan for today is to find ways to balance international trade as soon as possible. The government can directly or indirectly manage import trade. The implementation steps should be based on the trade situation in various countries, and carefully discuss barter trade or import and export ratio methods, and change the International Trade Bureau to be under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Finance and Industry to complete the above tasks. For export goods, standards should also be specified in accordance with business conditions to seek uniformity and facilitate sales. The Ministries of Industry and Finance are requested to carefully draft plans and proceed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unify State-Owned Enterprises</p>
<p>Production undertakings value concentration, which not only achieves greater results but also saves costs. Given our country's weak financial resources and lack of talent, if various construction undertakings are organized with divergent functions and powers, the plans will not be well-considered, and costs will also increase, inevitably resulting in being twice the effort for half the results. All unnecessary and redundant equipment should be abolished, and redundant institutions should be eliminated to reduce expenditure and increase work efficiency. The government is requested to convene various competent authorities to discuss thoroughly and decide on practical measures for implementation.</p>
<p>Adopt the Labor Conscription System</p>
<p>The levy of labor in our country has always been parallel to the tax system. Originally, public undertakings needed labor, and the people could contribute their surplus strength to help the country, which was a very good intention. Now that we are engaged in various construction projects, a lot of labor is needed. Rather than increasing micro-taxes and burdens, it is better to promote the labor conscription method. However, those who cannot personally participate in the work should pay money instead to show fairness. It is proposed to stipulate that able-bodied men in the country, from the age of twenty to fifty-five, should fulfill their obligation to work for three days each year for national and local construction undertakings, during the agricultural off-season. Those who have fixed occupations and incomes and have no time to serve should pay money according to three days' wages, which will be allocated for the specified purposes. All undertakings and public benefits related to central and local public welfare, or for public use by the people, may be subject to the micro-labor method. As for how to conscript and distribute the work, the Ministry of Interior is requested to draft an outline, and the various localities will formulate detailed rules for submission and implementation. If this is appropriate, we respectfully await public decision. Proposers: Kong Xiangxi, Huang Jilu, Jiao Yitang, Chuan Rulin, Qin Zhen, Liang Hancao.</p>

<p>The Tongsheng Steamer of the Datongxing Steamship Company ran aground off Ma Fu Cape on Hainan Island. It is now learned that the bottom of the ship has been ruptured and there is absolutely no hope of escape. All 60-odd crew members have left the ship and taken the Taikoo Company's Jiaying to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. They arrived yesterday and reported the accident to the company. It is reported that at high tide, only the funnel of the Tongsheng protrudes from the water surface. At low tide, the bow touches the rocks on the coast. Other than dismantling, there is no way to salvage the ship. The ship is insured for 95,000 yuan. Xu Zufan, a technician sent by the United Ship Insurance Association, went to inspect the ship and has not yet returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Change of British Ambassador to China, Foreign Newspapers Discuss Political Observers <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening Post reports that political observers in Shanghai believe that the sudden announcement of the replacement of British Ambassador to China Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen by Sir Archibald Clark Kerr comes at a time when the new Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, is about to take office. They see a connection, believing that the changes of the British and Japanese ambassadors are clear signs of slight changes in the two countries' policies towards China. It is now believed that Britain's policy will be firmer than before, while Japan's policy, partly due to London's stance in recent months, will not be as focused on active expansion as before. Sources in Japanese circles claim that Ariyoshi's arrival in China will involve discussions with China to resolve accumulated cases between the two countries over the past five years. Many observers believe that if this resolution is successful, the new situation created by Japan's use of force since the September 18th Incident will be greatly strengthened. However, at the same time, Japan's progressive active expansion in mainland China will cease. These sources also believe that since Sir Frederick Leith-Ross came to China, Britain's policy has been to contain Japan's expansion. Recently, many reports have been published stating that although Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's trip appeared to be only for economic investigation, his trip was opposed by the British Foreign Office, and British Ambassador Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen did not welcome him much either. However, after a major change in the British Foreign Office, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross achieved great success in the currency reform in Nanjing and the relaxation of Japan's autocratic actions in North China, and was thus trusted by the British government and public. Furthermore, the new British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, recently served as Minister to Iran (Persia). In recent years, Britain has pursued a very firm policy in that country to resist Soviet Russia's encroachment on Iran. Therefore, Kerr's transfer to China is also related. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross is currently in Guangzhou and is scheduled to return to Shanghai next week. According to a guest in Hong Kong who spoke with Sir Leith-Ross, the Chinese currency system is now gradually improving, China is currently not negotiating international loans, and he strongly supports the connection between the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Kowloon-Canton Railway, so that goods from the Chinese mainland can be transported to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Second Freeze-Up Outside Dagukou; More Than Twenty Ships Trapped in Ice; Situation More Severe Than the First Time <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The severe cold in North China this year is unprecedented in over a century. It has been one and a half months since Dagukou froze over. On the 7th of this month, the Taikoo Line's S.S. New Shengjing used a special icebreaker to rescue the company's S.S. Nanchang, S.S. Huizhou, and other ships, breaking through four feet of solid ice for eighty-one nautical miles, allowing navigation for several days. Unexpectedly, since the 17th, strong southwest winds have risen for days, and the weather has been unusually cold. Ice floes have blown to the sea outside Dagukou again, re-freezing the previously opened航路, which is even more serious than the first time.</p>
<p>Ships Trapped</p>
<p>The Taikoo Line's S.S. Ganzhou has been surrounded by solid ice and has run aground on the ice bank with a damaged rudder. It is awaiting rescue. The S.S. Yingzhou is also on the ice, moving back and forth with the ice tide, drifting on the sea. The S.S. New Shengjing, which loaded cargo and passengers in Shanghai this time, arrived outside Dagukou on the afternoon of the 18th. The icebreaker was also ineffective and unable to resist the ice tide, so it had to turn back to Yantai midway. The Jardine Matheson's S.S. Rising Sun, which departed from Tianjin, also turned back to Tanggu to dock. In total, there are twenty-five ships from China, Britain, Japan, Norway, and other countries that have been blocked by ice again.</p>
<p>Passengers in Distress</p>
<p>Passengers trapped in the ice have no food or drink, causing great panic. Fortunately, the special icebreaker "巧利摩勒" (Chiao Li Mo Le) sent by Tianjin, together with rescue boats, gradually broke the ice and reached the ice sea, rescuing seventy passengers from the S.S. Shunli and one hundred passengers from the S.S. Chosen Maru to Dagukou. However, due to the ice freezing as soon as it was broken, no ship has been able to escape the danger, and it is now impossible to rescue the passengers trapped in the ice. Individual shipping companies telegraphed the Tianjin Harbor Bureau yesterday, requesting that a powerful icebreaker be sent to rescue them as soon as possible, otherwise the crew and passengers would face the worry of running out of food.</p>
<p>Foreign Media Reports</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory reported that the weather along the Chinese coast today (the 21st) remains bad, and navigation is greatly affected. Strong northerly winds with speeds of 25 to 30 miles per hour are currently hindering the navigation of ships between Shanghai and Hong Kong. There was drizzle at the southern ports at 6:00 AM, and visibility was still poor. Therefore, the three British airships that wanted to fly to Shanghai have temporarily postponed their departure. It is currently snowing in Tianjin and Tanggu in the north, and the temperature has dropped below freezing, so about twenty-five ships are reported to be frozen in the Bohai Bay. There is currently no hope of them sailing out.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee's proposal to establish a Bank Acceptance House has been approved by the representatives of the member banks and will be established in the short term. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of Acceptance House</p>
<p>The Bank Acceptance House will be affiliated with the Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee, and its nature will be the same as that of the bank clearing house. The articles of association have been approved, and the fifth executive committee of the committee, consisting of Li Fusun, Bei Songsun, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jilao, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, Chen Zheqing, and others, together with manager Zhu Boquan, deputy manager Xu Baoqi, and assistant managers Kong Bao-cheng and Ye Chunquan, are preparing for its establishment. The address has been decided to be within the committee on Hong Kong Road, and it is expected to be established in the short term.</p>
<p>Reviving Commerce and Industry</p>
<p>The acceptance method involves designating domestic commercial firms to use valuable goods stored in bank warehouses as collateral. After bank acceptance is approved and signed, it can be circulated and traded on the market or discounted at the committee's banks. At the same time, banks that accept discounts can rediscount with other banks or rediscount with leading banks when they need funds. This type of bank acceptance bill has excellent credit and can increase market liquidity, allowing industry and commerce to obtain financing. It will be beneficial to the entire market and can be controlled.</p>

The original report is as follows:</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Telephone Company completed the automatic telephone system (the extra-settlement roads have not been completed), it applied to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement to increase prices according to the contract. Users protested, and as a result, the price increased by 25%. Residential phones increased from 52 to 65 taels of silver, and commercial phones increased from 78 to 105 taels of silver. Although the increase started on July 1, 1932, it was retroactive to March 27 of that year because that was the date the renovation was completed. Furthermore, the usage fee was changed from a quarterly payment to a monthly payment. Users protested most strongly, and some had their phones removed. The rest paid the increased price under protest. Although the association actively argued on the basis of reason, it was ineffective. In October 1933, the Shanghai Telephone Company requested another price increase, intending to increase the price by another one-fifth, that is, residential phones would be charged 81 taels, 2 mace, and 5 candareens, and commercial phones would be charged 131 taels, 2 mace, and 5 candareens. The association sent a letter to the Public Works Department, expressing extreme opposition. The Public Works Department stated that the contract did not allow for a price increase within three years, so this price increase was not implemented. In 1935, the Shanghai Telephone Company stated that its profits were only 6% dividends and had not reached the 8% dividends and 2% reserves allowed by the contract, and it again applied to the Public Works Department for a price increase, intending to slightly increase residential phones and change commercial phones to pay-per-call. Users protested even more strongly. Therefore, at the representatives' meeting of the Ratepayers' Association on April 16, it was resolved to "urge the Public Works Department to organize a committee of experts to review the accounts of the Shanghai Telephone Company" and to issue a declaration: "The representatives' meeting believes that increasing telephone prices during this period of commercial recession is absolutely impossible. As for pay-per-call, there are many drawbacks and it is even more difficult to agree to. Furthermore, the service of the telephone company is not as good as the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the charges are higher. There are also many areas where internal expenses can be reduced. The association advocates that the Public Works Department should hire Chinese and foreign experts and representatives of the Chinese users with the most users to form a committee to thoroughly and comprehensively review the company's situation and strive to reduce unnecessary expenses and increase service efficiency to meet the purpose of public utilities," expressing opposition. This is the concept obtained before the establishment of the expert committee, and it is a unanimous resolution. On April 17, the meeting of Western ratepayers resolved, "In view of the fact that ratepayers have not yet had sufficient opportunities to study the proposed telephone price increase plan of the Shanghai Telephone Company, and in view of the unprecedentedly sluggish state of Shanghai's commerce and economy, we, the ratepayers, hereby request the Public Works Department to conduct negotiations with the company so as to postpone the immediate price increase and to have time to consult a special telephone committee. The committee should consist of one or more experts who are familiar with telephone technology and business and have no connection with public utility companies in Shanghai. The committee should be formed by the Public Works Department in consultation with several organizations in the Shanghai International Settlement that are most representative of residents of all nationalities." This motion was proposed by Mr. Qian Wei Jing, a Japanese national, and seconded by Mr. Qian Nong Yisan Lang, proving that the Japanese nationals opposed the most among the foreigners. However, after this resolution, the Public Works Department temporarily approved the telephone company to increase the price by 11% from April 1. The Public Works Department followed the above motion and hired British expert Mr. Braun, followed by Mr. Hu Ruixiang (Director of the Long-Distance Telephone Office of the Ministry of Communications) and Mr. Inada, who were added due to the dispute between the association and the Japanese nationals. Mr. Lei was added again due to company relations. The terms of reference of the Special Committee of Telephone Experts set by the Public Works Department are as follows: "1. Consider whether the Shanghai Telephone Company has the right to increase telephone prices from April 1, 1935, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise contract. Whether the expenditure on all equipment, various mechanical devices, and other industries required for business is economically sound, and whether the current operating and maintenance costs of the company are economically reasonable, and submit to the Public Works Department on the construction of the above items. 2. Consider whether it is appropriate to use a fixed-charge method for commercial phones, home phones, or both. If it is deemed appropriate, prepare a tariff for the fixed-charge method so that the operating capital invested by the company can obtain the net profit stipulated in the franchise contract, and submit to the Public Works Department on the above items. 3. Consider that if the per-call charge is still used, (A) commercial phone fee, (B) home phone fee, and (C) other fees included in the tariff, such as should be increased, how much should each be increased so that the operating capital invested by the company can exclusively obtain the net profit stipulated in the franchise contract, and submit to the Public Works Department on the above items." The association saw that its scope was too narrow, so it proposed to the Public Works Department to expand the scope, with three reasons: "1. The object of study should be the entire company, so the scope of study of this case should be the entire Shanghai Telephone Company. 2. The largest expenditures of the Shanghai Telephone Company should be the annual interest of 10% for shareholders and reserves, the operating income subsidy of 4.5% obtained by the International Electric Material Company, and the purchase material commission of 5%, and the income tax paid by the company. 3. If the Shanghai Telephone Company does not use the 'Haiqin' method when purchasing materials to avoid changes in exchange rates, then the losses caused by the changes must be huge." The three areas that should be expanded are as follows: "1. The guaranteed interest rate of the world's telephone business is far from the guaranteed interest rate of the Shanghai Telephone Company here, and the 6% company bonds of the Shanghai Telephone Company are issued in Shanghai and there is no excess. Is the guaranteed interest rate of 8% dividends and 2% reserves, totaling 10%, reasonable? We propose its reasonable interest rate. 2. Should the operating income subsidy, purchase material commission, and income tax be outside the operating expenses? 3. Is there a way to avoid the losses caused by exchange rate changes? To whom does the fault belong? Should it be compensated by the public?" The association also sent the letter to various organizations such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting their attention. Furthermore, since the Public Works Department did not adopt the three proposed expanded areas, it sent a letter to the Bureau solemnly stating, "If the scope of this study is not expanded, then the study report, the association will not be able to recognize it as satisfying the wishes of telephone users. There is room for consideration on this issue." Later, the Public Works Department replied, stating that the first issue of guaranteed interest was stipulated in the contract. The establishment of the expert committee was not to discuss the validity of the contract, but to consider how to fulfill the provisions of the contract under the current situation. The second issue of operating subsidies and purchase commissions had already been agreed upon by both parties to be discussed later. As for the third issue, the Bureau's proposed scope already included the provision to study the economic soundness of the telephone company's expenses. At the same time, an opinion was also submitted to the expert committee. According to the expert committee's report, 1. Regarding the telephone company's right to increase prices, it is considered a legal interpretation and does not express any opinion, but it is believed that there is a right. 2. Regarding the expenditure on equipment, devices, and industries of the telephone company, it is considered to be economically sound. 3. Regarding the operating and maintenance expenses of the telephone company, it is considered satisfactory, but there are several items that still need to be reduced. 4. Regarding the charging method, it is considered that a fixed-charge method should be adopted, regardless of residential or commercial use. 5. Regarding the price, it is proposed that commercial telephones be charged 10 yuan per month for 150 calls, and residential telephones be charged 6 yuan and 5 jiao per month for 100 calls. Beyond this limit, each call will be charged an additional 3 fen. The most important point that cannot be ignored is that although the charge is based on a fixed number of calls, the committee did not advocate, "There is a time limit for each call." As for other prices, some have been reduced, but most have increased, and the increase is very large. The expert committee's initial thought on the price for those who still use the per-call charge was that if a new price for the per-call charge method was charged in Shanghai, it would definitely reduce the number of users. The original report did not propose it. It was said in the supplement report that the per-call price should be 15 yuan and 5 jiao per month for commercial use and 9 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen per month for residential use. The current fixed-charge user pays 11 yuan per month for 150 calls, and additional calls are charged accordingly. However, the committee concluded, "The per-call charging method is not only not advocated by the committee, but it is resolutely considered unsuitable." After the release of the report of the Special Committee of Telephone Experts, the public opinion trend had generally tended to consider the fixed-charge method as reasonable in principle, so there were the following arguments: 1. Reduce the basic fee. 2. Increase the number of original limited calls. 3. Reduce the price of calls beyond the limit. According to the investigation, the current price and limit were debated fiercely in the committee. It was only due to the efforts of Committee Member Hu that this result was achieved. According to the Public Works Department's public bulletin, the following paragraph is included in the Board of Directors' minutes regarding the adoption of the report: "The Director-General also said that this morning (November 11, 1935), he met with a certain director who represented the Chinese directors and asked him to negotiate the following points with the telephone company: 1. Revise the fixed-charge tariff recommended by the telephone experts (i.e., commercial phone fee of 10 silver yuan per month for 150 calls, and home phone fee of 6 silver yuan and 5 jiao per month for 100 calls) as follows: Commercial phone fee of 10 silver yuan per month for 200 calls, and home phone fee of 6 silver yuan and 5 jiao per month for 150 calls. 2. The revised tariff shall be implemented from April 1, 1936 (i.e., one year after the temporary 11% price increase method is implemented) (the temporary price increase method was implemented from April 1, 1935). 3. After the above-mentioned revised tariff is adopted, the Bureau should immediately ask the company to revise the tariff at any time if the company's investment income exceeds the permitted 10% so that the telephone fee is immediately reduced. If the above-mentioned revised tariff is in place, the company shall not request another price increase within five years from the date of implementation of the tariff. 4. The Bureau should ask the company to further reduce operating and maintenance costs." According to the Director-General's discussion with the telephone company, the company did not agree to the first item. The company was willing to accept the second item, but changed April 1 to March 1. Regarding the third item, the company was also willing to accept the first point, but could not agree to the second point that there should be no price increase within five years. The company accepted the fourth item. After deliberation, there was no room for maneuver on the International Settlement's side. On the side of the French Concession's Public Works Bureau, although the Ratepayers' Association of that Concession proposed revisions, it was handled in accordance with the Public Works Department of the International Settlement. The major reason for this case is naturally that the guaranteed interest rate allowed by the franchise contract is too high, but once the contract is signed, the Public Works Department naturally has no way to break it. After the new method is implemented, it is a matter of fact whether the income of the telephone company is reduced by many removals and the company still cannot obtain the permitted interest. However, legally, if the telephone company still cannot get its wish, the Public Works Department will naturally have to approve it if the telephone company applies for a price increase. The failure of the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company was based on this. If the effectiveness and cost are not consistent, in other words, if the effectiveness is low and the cost is high, the demand will naturally decrease. The Director-General of the Public Works Department used the analogy of water meters, but he did not carefully consider that telephone and tap water are economically completely different in nature, because the former is something that can be freely chosen, while the latter is indispensable for life. Now, the opposition's strategy is to prefer removal rather than achieve their goal, but there have been two waves of telephone price increases. The first time was during the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company era, when both commercial and residential phones had to pay per call, limited to 300 calls. As a result of the opposition, the per-call charge was still used, but the price increase was very large, and many people voluntarily removed their phones. The second time was the price increase in 1932, when many people also voluntarily removed their phones, but it was not enough to make the telephone company stop the price increase. The extent to which users need telephones varies greatly, and there is no centralized union, so judging from the facts, the method of removal has historical evidence and is difficult to be effective. Then what will be the result of relying on nature? It can be predicted that the market will become more depressed, and some public agencies with the most economic foundation will also greatly reduce staff. Therefore, for telephones, which are still considered dispensable in our country, the demand for them will inevitably decrease due to the recession in the market. However, for users who need telephones the most, their business is mostly contacted on the telephone, and their expenses will inevitably increase greatly. Some have two telephones, and the average calculation is that each phone requires 40 calls per day. Some brokers calculate that one telephone has as many as 200 calls per day. Finally, it must be noted that although it was mentioned above that there is no time limit for each call, according to reports, the telephone company stipulates in the new regulations that hotels, associations, etc. are limited to five minutes for each call, and every five minutes beyond this will be counted as one call. If it is less than five minutes, it will also be counted as one call. The Public Works Department ordered that it not be implemented, but this article was not removed from the regulations. I do not know the reason for this. This must be solemnly reported. February 22, 1936.</p>

The delegation announced the qualifications for participation yesterday morning as follows: Factories that believe their products can gain sales in Nanyang and can supply the necessary funding and personnel can participate as Class A members. Factories that are not fully confident in promoting their products or cannot supply the necessary funding and personnel can consult with employee factories in similar industries, discuss with several factories, and each send one person, or register temporarily with the Association. When members of the same type register, they can consult with each other and jointly send personnel.

<h3 id="e141">Last Year's Overview of Sino-Polish Trade: Exports Increased by 7% <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Since China and Poland signed a trade agreement, trade between the two countries has increased annually. With the rise of the port of Gdynia, built by Poland in recent years, there is a direct shipping route between Shanghai and the port, running every three weeks. At the same time, Poland has also established a commercial association in Shanghai, displaying various products and directly ordering goods on behalf of customers, which has made trade between the two sides more convenient. China's exports to Poland are mainly soybeans, sesame, tea, soybean cakes, pig bristles, tung oil, pig intestines, peanuts, and antimony. The export statistics for the previous year amounted to over 2,123,000 yuan. Poland's imports are mainly rayon, wool, wool yarn, cigarette paper, steel plates, zinc, woolen cloth, chemicals, etc. The import statistics for the previous year were approximately 1,237,000 yuan in Customs Gold Units. As for the overview of trade last year, China's exports to Poland increased by about 7% compared to the previous year. However, most of China's exports to Poland are first shipped indirectly to London, Hamburg, Amsterdam, etc., and then transshipped to Poland. The statistics for these exports are therefore included in the trade of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries. Conversely, some goods imported from Poland are not directly shipped from the port of Gdynia to Shanghai. Therefore, the actual trade volume between the two countries is definitely more than this figure. According to customs statistics, direct imports from Poland last year amounted to 1,359,911 Customs Gold Units, an increase of 10% compared to the previous year. As far as China's total imports are concerned, Polish goods accounted for only 0.23% of imports in the previous year, but this increased to 0.25% last year.</p>

If it is not resolved immediately, the manufacturers' turnover will be exhausted, and it will be impossible to continue. You are aware of the difficulties of businesses and care about the suffering of the people. I sincerely hope that you will expedite the review based on the situation, so that it can be canceled as soon as possible, and the people can be relieved of their hardship.

<h3 id="e144">Foreign Exchange Banking Association Notice: Deposit Interest Rates Reduced Starting Yesterday; Due to Market Stability, Monetary Conditions Gradually Loosening, and Foreign Exchange Stabilized; Uniformly 5% for Three Months, Six Months, and One Year <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the government implemented the new monetary policy and the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have made efforts to stabilize foreign exchange, various industries have become active, the market has stabilized, and monetary conditions have gradually loosened. The Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banking Association has announced a reduction in deposit interest rates. The Chinese Bankers Association and the Chinese Money Shops Association will jointly reduce deposit and loan interest rates. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Market Stability and Loosening Monetary Conditions</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new monetary policy on November 4 last year, the demand for legal tender from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications has increased sharply. The whole country is using it uniformly, and a note issuance reserve committee has been established to check and announce the reserves on a monthly basis to show credibility. The amount of money in circulation has increased, and various industries have gradually become active. Monetary conditions have gradually loosened. For example, the interbank loan rate announced in the money market yesterday was 7 fen per 1,000 yuan per day, which is lower than in previous years.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Stabilized</p>
<p>The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have made great efforts to stabilize foreign exchange, which has been quite effective. For example, the exchange rates announced by the Central Bank yesterday were: 1 shilling 2.5 pence for London, 30 US dollars for New York, 451 francs for Paris, 74 marks for Berlin, 103 yen for Japan, and 92 Hong Kong dollars, which are very stable. At the same time, various banks use the Central Bank's exchange rates as the standard for foreign exchange transactions. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced yesterday morning that the equalization tax rate was 5%.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Reduce Interest Rates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banking Association agreed to set fixed deposit interest rates on February 22 last year, raising them to 7% for three months, 6% for six months, and 5% for one year. On February 1 this year, in view of market stability and loosening monetary conditions, interest rates were reduced to 6% for three months, 5.5% for six months, and 5% for one year. On February 20, a further notice was issued to member banks to reduce interest rates, which will be implemented on March 1. The interest rate for current deposits (i.e., current accounts) is 2% for banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank.</p>
<p>Twenty Banks Implemented Yesterday</p>
<p>The foreign banks that implemented the reduction in deposit interest rates starting yesterday, i.e., member banks of the Foreign Exchange Banking Association, include: Mercantile Bank, HSBC, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, British Bank of the Middle East, Citibank, American Express Bank, Chase Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Bank of Chosen, Mitsui Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Banque de l'Indochine, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, Banca Italo-Cinese, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and Banque Industrielle de Chine, a total of twenty banks.</p>

<p>The spring season has arrived, and the sundial is lengthening.</p>
<p>Extended opening hours for the convenience of tourists.</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road has purchased a pair of kangaroos from Hong Kong, one male and one female, which have now been shipped to Shanghai for display. At the same time, with the arrival of spring and the lengthening of the sundial, the opening hours have been extended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Purchase of Kangaroos: The zoo has purchased a pair of male and female kangaroos from Hong Kong. Their fur is gray, and they are exceptionally robust. The cost was only 70 national currency. They are now on display in the Water Ting Room. The zoo originally had a pair of kangaroos, so there are now two pairs. It is said that the origin of these kangaroos is in Australia.</p>
<p>Orangutan Bear Coming: The zoo's donation of a peacock with fish-scale patterns to the Ueno Onshi Zoo in Tokyo was shipped to Japan yesterday. The bear donated by the Ueno Zoo will be transported to Shanghai by Director Shen, who is scheduled to return to China in early April. It is also learned that the beast can stand upright, hence the name "orangutan bear."</p>
<p>Extended Opening Hours: At the same time, the zoo, with the arrival of spring and the lengthening of the sundial, has extended its opening hours by half an hour for the convenience of visitors. The hours are now from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and from 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM in the afternoon. The anthrax that was previously discovered in the animal pens has been eradicated after the use of flame throwers on the pens.</p>

<p>Japanese residents are engaged in prevention on a daily basis.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, since the outbreak of severe typhoid fever of unknown origin in the Shigaota Road area of the Japanese residential district in this city, the Japanese Residents' Association has urgently sought to prevent it. On the afternoon of the 20th, representatives from various neighborhoods were convened to discuss the matter. In addition to disinfecting the homes of those already infected, leaflets with prevention tips were distributed to nearby residences. Inoculations are also being given at the Japanese Higher Girls' School (only for Japanese people). The area was originally a cultural residential area. From December 2, last year, to January 19, this year, there have been 15 cases of severe typhoid fever, 5 cases of scarlet fever, 7 cases of diphtheria, and 3 cases of dysentery, for a total of 30 cases.</p>

<p>The bidding for wooden furniture opened yesterday.</p>
<p>Shuimingchang Company won the bid.</p>
<p>The preparation of the city museum has been underway for several months. It is learned that the internal layout will also begin soon. All office equipment was advertised for contractor bidding at the beginning of the month. After careful review, several companies were selected. The bidding was opened yesterday at the municipal government.

<h3 id="e148">Relief for Unemployed Rickshaw Pullers: Registration Begins Today <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Joint Office of Jiangbei Associations in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to the rickshaw industry association to request assistance.</p>
<p>The Joint Office of Jiangbei Associations in Shanghai will provide relief to unemployed rickshaw pullers and has negotiated with the authorities to supplement the registration. Registration for unemployed rickshaw pullers is scheduled to begin today at three locations: the Nantong Association in Yongji Lane, Xizang Road; the Jianghuai Association in Shanghai on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei; and the Jianghuai Association in Shanghai on Huining Road, Nanshi. The office also sent a letter to the Special Zone Office of the rickshaw industry association yesterday to request assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cheng Xiechun's Talk: According to Cheng Xiechun, a member of the Jianghuai Association, since the devastation of the January 28 Shanghai Incident, followed by the wave of recession and the attack of rural bankruptcy in the interior, the employment situation has become increasingly acute. The large number of unemployed public rickshaw pullers is particularly serious. Since the two concessions in this city implemented new regulations last year, holding rickshaw puller registration and requiring the payment of one yuan and the collection of an arm badge as a proof of pulling, the time limit for registration was short, resulting in more and more rickshaw pullers who had not been registered being forced and unable to perform labor. The daily hard work and sweat of the rickshaw pullers was already insufficient to feed their families. Now, they are being subjected to such a harsh policy of high pressure and being rejected from their livelihood, which is expected. The association believes that many rickshaw pullers are fellow villagers, and since they have come to the association to request relief, they should try their best to find a way. Therefore, the Jiangbei Associations in Shanghai organized a joint office to find a way to provide relief and hope that the livelihood of unemployed rickshaw pullers will become stable. The relief measures will be discussed in detail after the registration of unemployed rickshaw pullers is completed, so that both the law and human feelings are taken care of.</p>
<p>Letter to the Association: The Joint Office of Jiangbei Associations in Shanghai,</p>
<p>Sent a letter to the Special Zone Office of the rickshaw industry association yesterday, stating that the Jiangbei Associations in Shanghai have reported that since the concession authorities held rickshaw puller registration last year and did not fully implement it, poor people from Jiangbei who came to Shanghai to pull rickshaws have been forced to become unemployed. They are wandering the streets, their livelihoods are cut off, and the situation is miserable, and they need to be relieved. Rickshaw pullers have always been free to operate rickshaws without registration. Now, they are disregarding the hardships of the workers and imposing restrictions, which not only cuts off a livelihood for poor farmers from the same village but also causes rickshaw owners to lose a lot of money due to the large number of idle rickshaws. If they do not try to remedy the situation, rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers will perish together. The office takes the connection of village friendships and the maintenance of the public welfare of the fellow villagers as its duty and purpose. It has received calls from all sides and cannot sit idly by. It has been decided to hold registration of unemployed rickshaw pullers starting on the 22nd of this month as a basis for negotiating with the concession authorities to supplement the registration. This matter concerns the interests of both rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers. We rely on your leadership in the special zone rickshaw industry and your concern for the hardships of rickshaw pullers. We hope that you will urge the rickshaw owners and unemployed rickshaw pullers to respond and relieve their suffering. This letter is sent to the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association Special Zone Office.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Bazilu: Obscene Institution Cracked <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Shameless men and women perform secret dramas.</p>
<p>Arrested and interrogated for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<p>A woman named Yin Zhang, from Tongzhou, recently established an obscene institution in a two-story Western-style house at No. 387 Bazilu. She hired local women named Chen Xiuzhen, Zhao Xiaomei from Hubei, Wang Suzhen from Liyang, Chen Deming from Huzhou, and men named Wu Youming, Lu Taotao, Pan Liansheng, Xu Hengzhong, and Xia Wenjin (all Tongzhou youth) to specialize in photographing erotic pictures and having two women use rubber yangruyi to perform various heinous and obscene dramas, named "Mirror" and "Flying All Over the Sky," for profit. Or they would go to small inns to perform for others, with each guest having to pay five yuan or at least three yuan to see the full picture. The other night, Chinese detectives Zhu Jihuang, Zhang Yuanjing, Tao Genrong, and detective Huang Fusen from the Hongkou Patrol discovered this. They disguised themselves as customers and went to investigate. After confirming that it was true, they took the ten men and women, including Qian Zhang, and the three obscene tools to the patrol room and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special No. 1 Court. Because the case concerned public morals, public attendance was prohibited. Sentencing will be scheduled on a fixed date.</p>

<p>The judge's persuasion was ineffective.</p>
<p>Mediation failed.</p>
<p>A woman named Wang Jinling, from Suzhou, is currently 21 years old and has a beautiful appearance. In October of the year before last, she was married to Yang Wei (also 21 years old), from Nanjing, the owner of the Xie Tai Shun Wood Company on Beijing Road, by the orders of her parents and the words of a matchmaker. After passing through the door, she lived with him at No. 37 Yongping Lane, Maigen Road. Recently, Wang claimed that her husband did not engage in proper work, spent all day in restaurants seeking flowers and asking willows, and often abused her. She felt that she could no longer live with him, so she hired lawyer Ling Qihong to submit a petition to the mediation office of the Special No. 1 Court to summon mediation, divorce Yang, pay a reasonable living allowance, and recover all her dowry. Yesterday, Judge Zhang opened the 13th court for mediation. According to Wang's testimony, Yang Wei has repeatedly abused me recently. The living expenses of six yuan per month, which had been previously ordered by the court, have also been deducted by two yuan. I really cannot live with him anymore. Yang Wei did not appear, but his lawyer appeared in court, denying that he had abused the petitioner and disagreeing with the divorce. Judge Zhang said that quarrels between husband and wife are common and that it is not appropriate to want to separate immediately because of minor matters. He ordered both lawyers to persuade them to avoid litigation. Because the opinions of both parties could not be reconciled, he announced that the mediation had failed.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone: The Connection Line Is Fully Completed; Tonghua Can Be Made in Jiangsu and Jiangxi-Hunan Sections <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The long-distance telephone connection project in nine provinces, which was planned by the Ministry of Communications, has been completed. Tonghua can now be made in the Qingjiang-Zhenjiang section in Jiangsu Province and the Jiangxi-Hunan section. The Beijing-Shanghai trunk line is scheduled to be tested in the middle of next month. If the results are good, it is expected to be officially opened for business on April 1. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Process</p>
<p>In November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Communications borrowed funds from the China-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to establish the Long-Distance Telephone Engineering Office in the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Fujian, and Hebei. It actively sent personnel to erect telephone lines separately. Due to the excessive length of the lines and the large scale of the project, coupled with the impact of the floods last year, the project took more than a year to complete. Now, within Jiangsu Province, such as the Qingjiang to Zhenjiang section, tonghua has been made successively since the 15th of this month, and the results are excellent. The Jiangxi and Hunan sections were also connected on the 18th.</p>
<p>Completed in Order</p>
<p>In addition, the Hunan-Hankou line was also completed yesterday. The stations along the Beijing-Shanghai line, such as Xuzhou, have long been erected. The six lines from the capital to Tianjin, Jinan to Qingdao, Xuzhou to Zhengzhou, and Hankou to Changsha were all started on the 11th of last month. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Fujian connection line was completed later. The nine-province long-distance telephone takes Nanjing as the center. The entire project, in addition to using the original long-distance dedicated lines in the nine provinces, also built five new long-distance telephone trunk lines: Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Tianjin, Tianjin-Qingdao, Xuzhou-Ezhou, and Ezhou-Hankou, connecting the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Fujian, and Hebei. It can also connect the branch lines of Hangzhou, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Changsha, Hankou, Wuchang, Anqing, Nanchang, and Wuhu. In total, hundreds of places can be connected. The general engineering office is scheduled to conduct test calls with various places in the middle of next month, with Nanjing and Shanghai as the center. The various bureaus are responsible for the technical aspects of each section. If the progress is smooth, it can be opened for commercial use on April 1.</p>
<p>Installation of Amplifiers</p>
<p>This long-distance telephone line is too long. Telephone relies on the transmission of electricity, so the farther the distance, the weaker the electric waves, and the sound is not easy to be clear. The general engineering office has purchased more than one hundred amplifiers to remedy this shortcoming. Each main bureau is equipped with one amplifier, and its transmission line is released through the machine, so that its special exercise is magnified and reaches the ears of the listeners. Even if the line passes through several main bureaus, it is also amplified separately. In the future, whether communicating from Nanjing with Beiping or Tianjin, the adjustment of the sound can be the same as with city calls. Currently, the equipment has been installed in seven places, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Zhengzhou, and Xuzhou. In addition, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, etc., have also begun installation.</p>

<p>According to witness Xu Taohong's statement:</p>
<p>Responsibility lies with a rickshaw puller</p>
<p>Around 11 AM the day before yesterday, three rickshaws were traveling abreast from east to west near the Maigen Road Bridge. The rickshaw on the outside, numbered 5480, carried Zhang Songtian from Taizhou, age 41 (resident of No. 5, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei). Suddenly, the rickshaw in the middle violently bumped the outer rickshaw, causing Zhang to fall to the ground. Just then, bus No. 15049, Route 10, driven by Xu Zian, was speeding from west to east. Unable to brake in time, the front right wheel ran over Zhang, causing severe injuries. By the time the police arrived after being notified, only the rickshaw Zhang had been riding in remained; the others were gone. The Xinza Gate police station was immediately notified, and an ambulance was called to the scene. Zhang was rushed to the Binlong Hospital for treatment. Detectives were also dispatched to investigate. Unfortunately, Zhang's injuries were critical, and he died at 4 AM yesterday. The body was taken to the Philand Road morgue. Around 10 AM, Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. First, a Western officer, Zhou Weilisi, explained the situation, stating that he had questioned the rickshaw puller who had taken Zhang, who resided at No. 56, Jiesifei Road, Caojiadu. However, detectives sent to that address found no one. The deceased's address was also still unknown. Furthermore, witness Xu Taohong, a tea server at the Maigen Road People's School, testified that the accident occurred in front of the school gate, so he had witnessed it. He confirmed that the rickshaw in the middle had bumped the outer rickshaw, causing the deceased to fall and be run over by the bus. The bus was not traveling very fast, he said. After hearing the testimony, Prosecutor Tang ruled that the deceased, Zhang Songtian, male, had died from injuries sustained when he was run over by public bus No. 15049. The body was handed over to the Pushan Shanzhuang for coffin storage.</p>

<p>Both the man and woman sentenced to two months imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhou Xianqing, a native of Ningbo, age 27, lived at No. 65, Lane 674, Tangshan Road, and worked as a salesman in the import/export department of the Wantai Foreign Firm on Yuan Road. His wife, Xu, age 22, had been married to him for 16 years and had two daughters, one five years old and one three years old. Last year, Xianqing fell in love with a female relative from his hometown, Dai Ruidi, and rented a house on Diswei Road to live with her in secret for three months. When his wife found out, they moved to Wusong Road. Ms. Xu argued with him. Zhou claimed that Dai was pregnant and he could not leave her. He offered to provide his wife with 20 yuan per month for household expenses. Later, with the help of relatives and friends, and with a lawyer as witness, he claimed to have severed relations with Ruidi. A contract was drawn up around May 30th. However, Zhou continued to live with the woman. On June 4th, the two became engaged. In the autumn, Dai gave birth to a child. On November 29th, they openly held a wedding banquet at the Heping No. 1 Restaurant on Pingliang Road, deceiving his wife Xu. Recently, they moved to No. 40, East Xihua Road, abandoning Ms. Xu. After Ms. Xu found out the whole story, she was extremely angry and, unable to bear it any longer, reported the situation to the Huishan Police Station. She accused her husband of bigamy. The head detective dispatched Chinese detective Sun Aizhong to secretly investigate. He brought Zhou and Dai to the police station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The Municipal Council's lawyer, Di Shizhu, described the case and filed a public prosecution for offenses against the family and bigamy. The three marriage contracts were presented for inspection. Zhou's wife, Xu, then explained the situation, stating that Dai was the sister-in-law of her elder brother and should not have been involved in such a scandalous affair. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Zhou retained lawyer Yan Fangang to defend them. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Zhou Xianqing and Dai Ruidi to two months imprisonment each, two years of deferred imprisonment, and confiscated the red wedding invitations.</p>

<p>A refined and well-organized women's apartment will be built at No. 6, Happiness Lane, Luban Road, French Concession. The project is being managed by Ms. Zheng Juefei of the advertising department of the *Great America Evening News*. Ms. Zheng has always been a strong advocate for women's causes. Considering the size of Shanghai, the number of women's apartments is small, and well-equipped ones are even rarer. Therefore, she is investing a large sum of money to create a new type of women's apartment, which will be named "Public Women's Apartment" to show that everything in the apartment is designed to cater to the psychology of the general public. Everything used will be custom-made, and the furnishings, lighting, and decor will be as luxurious and magnificent as possible. Any woman traveling to Shanghai, whether studying at a school or working for a major company, who has not found suitable accommodation and board, and who feels that ordinary hotels are too mixed with men and women, and that renting a house is too expensive, and who desires to find a refined, suitable, cost-effective, and comprehensive women's apartment, can contact No. 6, Happiness Lane, Luban Road. The apartment faces the French Park, has fresh air, and is very hygienic. It is also conveniently located, with the French Concession's Route 10 tram and Route 11 bus available. It is truly a blessing for women in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Two Opium Smokers Registered and Licensed, Disagree with the Prison Sentence <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Why impose a criminal penalty when a limited-time smoking cessation permit has already been obtained?</p>
<p>Since the concession is also Chinese territory, why are the smoking prohibition regulations not applicable?</p>
<p>—The appeal case of Chen Arong, Xiong Sanbao, etc.—</p>
<p>Chen Arong, a 57-year-old Suzhou native, resided on the second floor of No. 22, Yuqing Lane, Baliqiao Road, French Concession. Xiong Sanbin, a 45-year-old local resident, resided on the third floor. The two were arrested by the French police on January 14 of this year for smoking opium and sentenced by the Second Special Court on January 25. Chen and Xiong were each sentenced to three months imprisonment and ordered to quit within one month. The two defendants disagreed with the sentence and retained lawyers Zhang Tuzhao and Wang Shizong to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Their reasons are as follows: Chen Arong makes a living by selling used goods and had collected discarded lampstands, but did not use them. On that day, he asked Xiong Sanbin, who lived with him, to write a letter. He was not smoking at the time, as can be proven by the patrol officer. Since he was not caught smoking opium on the spot,</p>
<p>It is unjust to convict him of smoking opium.</p>
<p>This is the first reason for disagreement. Stepping back, even if he were smoking, the "Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Smoking and Elimination of Smoking Households" issued by the Tobacco Control Supervisor state that those who are elderly or ill and have become addicted to smoking, and who cannot quit for the time being, may apply for registration and obtain a limited-time smoking cessation permit after being diagnosed and certified by a doctor or smoking cessation organization, allowing them to smoke temporarily, but they must gradually quit within six years, and they may not apply for an extension of the permit after the expiration date. The defendants have already followed the regulations and completed all the procedures. Thus, on the one hand, the smoking cessation organization issues a permit, allowing them to smoke because they cannot quit for the time being, and on the other hand, it strictly prohibits smoking, and all smoking is considered a crime.</p>
<p>Both are national organizations.</p>
<p>Why are they contradicting themselves in this way? Where is the credibility of the state? Furthermore, the sentence of quitting within one month is also unreasonable. If the doctor and the smoking cessation organization's certification are valid, wouldn't they be redundant? The six-year period has already been explicitly permitted, also ensuring the so-called inability to quit for the time being. In short, since this case has been dealt with in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Smoking Offenses, the provisions of the second half of the Smoking Offenses Punishment Regulations contradict reason and law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is difficult to make people willing.</p>
<p>This is the second reason for disagreement. Furthermore, Article 13 of the "Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Smoking and Elimination of Smoking Households" stipulates that those who smoke without obtaining a limited-time smoking cessation permit shall, in addition to being required to pay two to ten times the permit fee, be detained in a smoking cessation organization to verify whether they are addicted. If they are addicted, they shall be ordered to quit. Those who are elderly or ill and cannot quit for the time being may be ordered to pay the fee and obtain a supplementary permit. Those who do not obey the order to quit or do not pay the additional permit fee shall be transferred to the court for punishment according to law. Thus, the transfer to the court is for those who smoke without a permit. In addition to recovering the permit fee, they are detained in a smoking cessation organization to verify their addiction and ordered to quit.</p>
<p>However, those who are elderly or ill</p>
<p>and cannot quit for the time being may be ordered to obtain a supplementary permit. Those who do not obey the order to quit or do not pay the permit fee are punished according to law. In this case, because they are ill and cannot quit for the time being, they have a permit certified by a doctor and a smoking cessation organization. It cannot be compared to those who do not pay the permit fee. There is no need to transfer them to the court for punishment. The transfer to the court has already lost the original intention of the legislation. The court's hasty sentencing shows that it cannot understand the laws and is obviously untrue. How can people be convinced? Since this case is dealt with in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Smoking Offenses, but the provisions of Article 19 of the same regulations are not considered,</p>

<p>Ding Axin, a local resident, 52 years old, formerly a cook, has a son named A Hai, born to his first wife. He was sent to an orphanage to be raised and later boarded with his relative Ren Jiling and recognized Ren as his foster father. Ren then sent A Hai to a school to study. After graduating, Ren also helped him raise funds to establish the Jiling Elementary School in Hongzhen, with himself as the principal. At that time, Ding Axin and his stepmother also moved into the school. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Jiling was destroyed, and Ding Axin and his son fled and became separated. A Hai drifted aimlessly. Recently, he heard that his father, Axin, had opened the New Ritual Hall at No. 45, Hengjie, west of the Catholic Church in Dongjiadu, outside the Xiaonan Gate, specializing in celebrations, and had accumulated some savings. Therefore, he asked his father for some money. Axin gave him five yuan, which made A Hai resentful. Suddenly, at about 7 AM yesterday morning, he hired a car from the Yunfei Car Company on Qiujiang Road, and hid a fake pistol and a pre-written letter, saying that after a few days, he had decided to borrow the money, and would return it in full after three years. He was now going to Sichuan to seek a career, so please do not pursue the matter. He drove to the door of the New Ritual Hall. A Hai entered the inner room. At that time, he saw his stepmother, Ms. Yang, lying in bed, not yet awake. A Hai immediately took out the fake pistol from his side, threatened her not to make a sound, and then rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, searching and seizing 235 yuan in legal tender and a promissory note for 300 yuan. He fled out the door. Yang's cousin, Hong Xiulin, and Ding Axin's apprentice, Xiao Chongming, saw A Hai step into the car and immediately shouted, "Catch the robber!" Patrol officer Liu Wenxin from the ninth post and police officer Ni Kehui from the thirtieth post heard the alarm and rushed over. A Hai, in desperation, used the fake pistol in the car to threaten the driver to drive quickly in an attempt to escape. He threw the hidden letter out of the car. Unexpectedly, the driver, Hu Zhongen, had already seen through the use of his fake pistol and deliberately refused to drive. When the police officers rushed into the car, they arrested Ding A Hai, seized the fake pistol, and recovered the stolen goods. They took the witnesses and the suspect back to the Dongjiadu police station. The station chief, Yi, conducted a preliminary investigation and ordered him to be detained temporarily for further investigation by the police team before being sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Chen Zhi, a native of Jiangbei, lived at No. 271, Weixing Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. Having lived in Shanghai for more than thirty years, he operated a number of businesses in the Zhabei area, including real estate, rickshaw companies, and bathhouses, and recruited a large number of followers, numbering several thousand. Therefore, he had the nickname "Jiangbei Big Boss of Zhabei." Recently, Yao Gonglin, the murderer of Ji Agen, a former detective of the Kunshan County Detective Team, identified Chen as the instigator of the case. The Xinza Gate Public Security Bureau investigated, but for a long time, they did not make any progress. Last winter, Chen suddenly surrendered himself to the court. After investigation by the prosecutor, Chen was publicly prosecuted according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law for the crime of inciting murder. Judge Li of the Criminal Court has already questioned him. Because there were matters to investigate with the detective team and public security bureau personnel who handled the Yao Gonglin case, he ordered the defendant to pay a store guarantee of 30,000 yuan, and postponed the hearing. Recently, the hearing was resumed, and all the witnesses were summoned to testify. The oral arguments were concluded in court, and the verdict was set for the 26th of this month. The details of the trial are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shi Zuhan At 10:20 AM yesterday morning, Judge Li ascended to the seat in the Fifth Criminal Court and ordered the court clerks to bring the plaintiff and defendant to the court. After questioning them one by one about their age, origin, address, and occupation, he instructed the defendant Chen Zhiyi, "In order to clarify the truth in this case, this court has retrieved the files of the murderer Yao Gonglin and the plaintiff Ji Wang's statements in the Public Security Bureau, and the personnel handling this case have also been summoned. Today, the testimony of the witnesses must be interrogated separately." After the order was completed, Chen Zhi was ordered to retreat to the waiting room. First, Shi Zuhan, the leader of the detective squad handling the case, was brought to the court. He was instructed, "This court summoned you to testify today because you handled the Yao Gonglin murder case. You must tell the truth. If you say anything false, you will be prosecuted for perjury." Shi then testified, "I am 27 years old, a native of Hang County, and the leader of the squad in the Xinza Gate Public Security Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team. At 2:22 PM on July 22nd last year, I received a call from the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, saying that the murderer Yao Gonglin, who killed Ji Agen, was seen by Ji's wife, Wang, and had been brought into the police station. After receiving this call, I sent someone to the police station to transfer the plaintiff and defendant to the team. Because it was late that day, our detective team did not have a detention center, so we sent him to the Xinza Gate Sub-bureau for detention. The next day, we transferred him to the team for interrogation." Judge Li asked, "Did you use torture when you interrogated Yao Gonglin?" Shi answered, "We don't use torture in any case. However, the plaintiff Ji Wang said two sentences to Yao Gonglin during the interrogation, which I suspected very much." The judge asked, "What did she say?" He answered, "She said to Yao Gonglin, 'Now that things have come to this, you should tell me quickly, whether it was I who had a feud with my husband, or someone else who hired you to kill my husband.'" The judge asked, "Then how did Yao Gonglin answer?" He answered, "Yao Gonglin said to her, 'It was not my intention to kill your husband. It was Chen Zhi who instructed me.' When I heard this, I ordered the detective Mao Gongzhao to take Ji Wang out, fearing that Ji Wang would instigate Yao Gonglin to falsely accuse Chen Zhi. After Ji Wang left, I interrogated him in detail." The judge asked, "Did you use torture at this time?" He answered, "I didn't use torture, but I scared him. I said, 'Tell me the truth honestly. Don't wrong anyone. If you tell a lie, I won't be polite.' I asked him three or four times like that, and he still said that Chen Zhi had instigated him. I said, 'Since you say it was Chen Zhi, can you point him out?' He said he could. So I led the detectives to the Haiqing Bathhouse to arrest Chen, but he was not there. The bathhouse staff said that the boss was in his residence in Weixing Lane, Hengfeng Road, and had not come out. So we went to arrest him at his address, but we still didn't find him. According to his family, he had gone to Jiangbei. Therefore, Chen Zhi and the fugitives Jia Abao and Zhou Longkouzi were not arrested. Yao Gonglin was sent to the bureau and transferred to your court for interrogation. I don't know anything else."</p>
<p>Huang Chongren Subsequently, Huang Chongren, a member of the Xinza Gate Public Security Bureau, was summoned. He testified, "I am 38 years old, a native of Hunan." The judge asked, "Was it you who questioned Ji Wang about Yao Gonglin killing her husband?" Huang answered, "It was me who questioned her, but it was too long ago, it was last July. Moreover, there are many cases in our bureau, at least three or four every day. I have completely forgotten the details of this case. Your court sent me a subpoena earlier, asking me to come to court to testify. Our documents section is looking at the case file, but the file has been retrieved by your court. I don't know which aspect of the testimony the court wants me to prove now." The judge said, "Just tell the truth and don't favor any party. If you don't remember clearly, the testimony you took from them at that time is in the file here. You can take a look first." Huang then took the file and looked through it and said to the judge, "Everything I remember is in the file. I can't remember anything outside of the file." The judge asked, "When you questioned Yao Gonglin, did you use torture or threats?" Huang answered, "When we question cases, we don't talk about threats or torture at all. When Yao Gonglin arrived at the bureau, as soon as I asked him, he said what he had said in the detective team." The judge asked, "Is the testimony recorded on the approval form the same as the testimony he gave?" Huang answered, "Of course it is."</p>
<p>Lin Zhaowu Judge Li then turned to Lin Zhaowu, the chief of the interrogation section of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, and asked, "Was it you who questioned Yao Gonglin when the Yao Gonglin murder case was sent to the general bureau?" Lin answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "Since it was you who questioned him, do you still remember it clearly?" He answered, "I can't remember all the details of the case. I only remember that when I asked Yao Gonglin, he did not admit that he had killed Ji Agen. He only said that he saw Jia Ashi point a pistol at Ji Wang and not allow her to make a sound." The judge asked, "Did Yao Gonglin say that Chen Zhi was the instigator, that Ji Wang told him to say that, or did he say it himself, or did you use torture or threats to get him to say it?" He answered, "I didn't hear Ji Wang tell him to say it. We never use threats or torture when we interrogate cases. We record what the parties say."</p>
<p>Ji Wangshi The judge then turned to the plaintiff Ji Wangshi and asked, "Why did you say to Yao Gonglin in the detective team, 'Did I hire someone to kill my husband, or did someone else instigate it?'" Ji Wangshi answered, "I really didn't say anything like that. I only sent the bureau the list of murderers who had been filed when my husband was killed and requested that they be handled according to law to redress my husband's grievances. I had never heard of Chen Zhi as the instigator before Yao Gonglin was arrested. He is a famous Jiangbei Big Boss of Zhabei. If I had known, I would have sued him long ago. That's what Yao Gonglin said to me when I grabbed him. He said, 'You only抓 者 me, why don't you catch Chen Zhi?' That was when I first knew that in the detective team, Yao Gonglin had said that Chen Zhi was the instigator. The people in the detective team certainly didn't say good things about me and took me out because detectives like Mao Gongzhao are all Chen Zhi's disciples. Hearing that Yao Gonglin was biting their old man, they were certainly dissatisfied. Now your court prosecutor's office is prosecuting Chen Zhi for inciting murder according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law, which is a major case. How can he be released on bail?" The judge said, "This is a legal study. We think he can be released on bail. You don't understand the law and don't need to pursue it. Regarding the incidental private prosecution, you withdrew it yourself last time and then applied to restore the original state, but this is a legal procedure and has not been completed. What is your decision now? Your private prosecution lawyer is also not here." Ji Wangshi answered, "My lawyer, Fei Guoxi, often goes to Chen Zhi's Haiqing Pool to bathe and is afraid to come. I can't think of any way to proceed with the private prosecution. Please rule according to law."</p>
<p>Chen Zhi At this point, the judge ordered the defendant Chen Zhi to be brought to the court and instructed him, "The witnesses summoned to the court today are the captain of the detective squad, the director of the Xinza Gate Branch, and the director of the investigation section of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau. They are all the personnel in charge of Ji Wang's lawsuit against Yao Gonglin. Their testimony is that Yao Gonglin said you were the instigator and that it was not obtained through torture or threats. It was all Yao Gonglin who said it himself. What do you have to say in response?" Chen Zhi answered, "I am an honest businessman and have always held a charitable and moral heart. Even a dog's life is a life, let alone a human being. I am already in my fifties and have children. How could I do such a conscience-less thing? Yao Gonglin was originally a disciple of Yang Wenbin, the leader of the detective team in Kunshan County. I sued Yang Wenbin. He was sentenced to a crime. He would be taking revenge for his old man by biting me. The court must not adopt his testimony." The judge asked, "What do you have to say about the private prosecution?" Chen answered, "Ji Wangshi herself wanted to withdraw it before the trial. She doesn't want the money, so I don't need to answer." At this point, Judge Li ordered the court clerk to invite the prosecutor to the court to argue the case and instructed the defendant's defense lawyer to begin the argument. This took an hour. Judge Li then announced, "The arguments in this case are concluded, and the verdict will be announced on the 26th of this month. The defendant will remain on the original bail." Then he adjourned the court.</p>

Zheng Yue was sent by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to attend the meeting. He rang the bell to start the meeting. Zhang Tao, the representative of the Hangzhou County Association, was elected as the chairman. Ji Xian was the secretary. The meeting proceeded as usual. The details are recorded below. The chairman reported that the association has a total of sixty-eight member associations, and representatives from forty-three associations were present today, which is sufficient for a quorum, and declared the meeting open. Zhang Shijie, director of the procedural group, reported on the resolutions of the fifth general meeting and read them out one by one. The chairman reported that Shen Honglie, the mayor of Qingdao, had sent a telegram to congratulate the assembly. (Resolved) A reply telegram will be sent to thank him. The presidium Qiu Zhaowen took the stage to report on the opinions of the seven representatives of the presidium Liu Liumin, Li Hongyue, Chen Mingjian, Mou Shaozhou, Shen Junru, and Qiu Zhaowen who reviewed five proposals last night, and then the discussion of the proposals began. (A) The Capital Lawyers Association proposed that there should be a definite method for inspecting opium smokers. The review opinion was to pass the original proposal. It was resolved to pass the review opinion. (B) The three lawyers' associations of Shaoxing, Hangzhou, and Yin County in Zhejiang province proposed to request the Ministry of Judicial Administration to issue a notice to all levels of courts to accept the pleadings prepared by lawyers and exempt them from the pleading fee in order to comply with laws and regulations. The review opinion was that this was a unique event in Shaoxing, and the Executive Committee should send a letter to the Zhejiang Higher Court, ordering the Shaoxing Local Court to abolish the pleading fee. It was resolved to pass the proposal. (C) The Songjiang Lawyers Association proposed that the court should respect the personality and treatment of lawyers. The review opinion was that the principle of this case has been adopted in the draft Lawyers Law drafted by the association and should be retained. It was resolved to handle it together with the draft of the Lawyers Law itself. (D) The County Lawyers Association proposed to amend the association's charter to conform to the actual name. The review opinion was that it concerned the amendment of the association's charter, and there was no endorsement of more than one-third of the members, so the procedure was not in compliance and should be retained. It was resolved to pass the review opinion. (E) The Shanghai Lawyers Association suggested that the highest judicial authority should coordinate with the foreign authorities to seek to abolish or improve the existing agreements made by the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, which are about to expire, so as to unify the national trial system and complete national sovereignty. The review opinion was to refer it to the Executive Committee for handling. It was resolved to handle it according to the review opinion. Temporary motions: (A) The Yin County Lawyers Association suggested that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should be requested to order all local lawyers' associations to join the association. It was resolved to pass the proposal. (B) The Shanghai Lawyers Association proposed that the General Assembly should decide on Article 5 of the Association's Charter, the selection of representatives, and Article 16, the supplementary measures for concurrent positions. It was resolved that it was not established. (C) The Songjiang Lawyers Association suggested that the Legislative Yuan should be requested to amend Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law. It was resolved to pass it in principle and refer it to the Executive Committee for handling. (D) The Shanghai Lawyers Association proposed that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should submit to the Judicial Yuan to request the Legislative Yuan to amend Article 681 of the Civil Law on Obligations. Because this case is of great importance, it was resolved to refer it to the Executive and Supervisory Committee for consideration and handling. (E) The Wu County Lawyers Association proposed that the association should notify all lawyers' associations to stop lawyers from setting up branch offices and correspondence addresses, and to rectify the clerks in order to maintain discipline. It was mistakenly recorded yesterday as submitting it to the Ministry of Justice. In fact, it was resolved that the association should forward it to the various master lawyers' associations. The meeting adjourned at twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Continued Discussion in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 2:00 PM. Representatives from forty-six lawyers' associations, including Cangwu, attended, with more than sixty people. Zheng Yue was sent by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to attend the meeting as a representative. Yan Yinwu, Director of the General Assembly Secretariat, Zhang Shijie, Director of the Procedural Group, Jin Xinmin, Director of the Propaganda Group, Wu Xuepeng, Director of the General Affairs Group, and others were present. The bell was rung to start the meeting. Qiu Zhaowen, the representative of Guangzhou, was elected as the chairman. Dai Jixian was the secretary. The meeting proceeded as usual. The details are recorded below. Jiang Yiping, the representative of Cangwu, proposed to increase the number of standing committee members and executive committee members. It was resolved to set nine standing committee members, twenty-nine executive committee members, and one secretary-general. It was proposed to elect various officials such as vote counters and ballot checkers. It was resolved to elect Zhuang Xiang, Liu Zuwang, Cai Li, Mou Shaozhou, Gong Shengzhi, Zhu YaKui, Zhang Shijie, Kuai Jinde, Li Hongyue, Wu Zengshan, and others on the spot to serve as officials. Secretary-General Yan Yinwu distributed the ballots one by one. A total of forty-six executive ballots and forty-six secretary-general ballots were issued. The ballots were written on the spot and put into the ballot box. The ballot box was opened and inspected. (The representative of the Ministry of Judicial Administration was present to supervise.) A total of forty-six executive ballots and forty-six secretary-general ballots were found. As a result, (A) Liu Liumin, the representative of Jiujiang, received forty-three votes for secretary-general and was elected as secretary-general. (B) Thirty lawyers' associations including Capital, Kaifeng, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, Hejian, Jinan, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Beiping, Wuchang, Taiyuan, Jiangdu, Cangwu, Linyi, Fushan, Luoyang, Wu County, Tongshan, Changsha, Tai'an, Huaining, Wujin, Jinhua, Xinyang, Weixian, Anchang, Zheng County, and Jining were elected as executive committee members. Because the three associations of Anchang, Zheng County, and Jining had the same number of votes, the administrative officer and the presidium used a lottery method on the spot, and the twenty-nine associations such as Anchang and Zheng County were elected as executive committee members. (C) More than twenty associations including Jining, Jiujiang, Yin County, Chengdu, Wuxi, and Xiaoshan were alternate executive committee members. After the election was completed, it was 9:30 PM and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Students from Various Schools of the Bureau of Works Are Enthusiastically Donating to Aid Relief <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Since the China Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief General Association at No. 505 Henan Road, this city, was approved by the Ministry of Interior last August to carry out Jianghe water disaster relief work, it has spared no effort in fundraising and relief. It has successively lectured on the disaster situation to schools at all levels in this city and solicited relief funds, which has been enthusiastically supported and actively donated by the authorities and students of various schools. The Chinese schools under the Bureau of Works, under the advocacy of Dr. Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department, have also joined in successively, such as the Bureau of Works Girls' High School, Nie Zhongcheng Public School, Yucai Public School, Huatong Public School, Gezhi Public School, West District Elementary School, Huishan Road Elementary School, Huade Road Elementary School, Jingzhou Road Elementary School, and North District Elementary School. As of the end of January this year, the total donations collected amounted to 2,653.58 yuan in national currency. Among them, the largest donation amount in the high school department was the Bureau of Works Girls' High School, with a total donation of 573.54 yuan in national currency, followed by Nie Zhongcheng Public School, with a total donation of 413.78 yuan, and then Yucai Public School, with a total donation of 374.39 yuan. In the elementary school department, West District Elementary School donated the most, with 348.79 yuan. Nie Zhongcheng Public School had the largest number of volunteer fundraisers, with 186 people. Such youth's courage to do what is right, willingness to do good deeds, is truly a blessing for the future of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e160">City Council Suggests Unifying Licensing Procedures in This City. The City Government Has Replied After Review by Various Bureaus. <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The various registrations and licenses handled by the bureaus in this city are extremely cumbersome. There are fourteen types issued directly by the Social Affairs Bureau or transferred by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Ministry of Industry. Nineteen types are issued by the Public Security Bureau. Eleven types are issued by the Finance Bureau. Seven types are issued by the Public Works Bureau. Eighteen types are issued by the Health Bureau. Ten types, totaling six types, are issued by the Public Utilities Bureau, totaling eighty-five types. Citizens are not clear about the procedures and nature, and often have to run around several places to apply for a license. The City Council of this city, in view of this, has specifically requested the City Government to unify the licensing procedures to benefit citizens. The City Government immediately handed it over to the relevant bureaus for review, and it has been reported jointly by the bureaus. All licenses issued are of a temporary nature and only related to one bureau, and are issued by that bureau. If they are of a permanent nature and related to more than two bureaus, the principle of obtaining one license should be followed. Licenses issued are subject to the regulations and must be reviewed by the relevant bureaus, and the old procedures should still be followed. The name of a certain license that has been agreed upon should be reported by a certain bureau. The licenses issued by various bureaus are replaced annually, or only issued once and do not need to be replaced annually, or inspected annually after issuance, which is not consistent. For the sake of uniformity and simplicity, except for the donation licenses issued by the Finance Bureau, which are receipts, and the medical, pharmaceutical, food, and beverage licenses issued by the Health Bureau, which will continue to be handled as before and cannot be changed, the remaining licenses will be changed to annual inspections, which has been replied to by the City Government to the City Council.</p>

<h3 id="e165">The Paper Industry in Shanghai (4) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by China Huixin</p>
<p>(Overview of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai XIV)</p>
<p>5.  Paper Market Conditions in the Past Year and Recently: In terms of the past year, the paper industry in various countries around the world has shown signs of improvement and prosperity. For example, the paper mills in major paper-producing countries such as the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Norway are all operating their paper machines at full speed. The only difference is that paper prices have not risen in the same proportion. As for China (especially Shanghai), its market conditions have generally declined, with the exception of the first four months. From January to March, the foreign paper market in this city was very active, and the import volume of foreign paper from the United States and Canada was very large. However, from the end of March, partly due to rumors of tariff revisions, market demand suddenly declined, and there was almost no sales in South China and North China. What cannot be ignored in this is that Japanese paper is selling well in various parts of North China. By October, the situation changed drastically, because rumors of new currency policies were rampant, and paper prices were soaring. At that time, six small import merchants suffered heavy losses in foreign exchange due to the fact that they had not paid for overseas orders, resulting in bankruptcy, because the foreign exchange against the pound sterling had fallen from 18 pence to 14 pence at that time. Before and after the promulgation of the new legal tender, the ups and downs of paper prices in this city were very significant. Now, several types of paper are selected and listed for comparison as follows:</p>
<p>October 8 October 20 November Estimated Value 4 Estimated Value Price Price Price White Writing Paper Per Ream 2 Yuan 3.50 Yuan 2.75 Yuan 2.50 Yuan Newsprint Roll Per Ream 2 Yuan 3.20 Yuan 3.60 Yuan 4.00 Yuan Daolin Paper Per Kilogram 0.22 Yuan 0.23 Yuan 0.24 Yuan 0.015 Yuan Small Waxed Paper Per Ream 10 Yuan 11 Yuan 12.50 Yuan Kraft Paper Per Ream 6 Yuan 7 Yuan 8 Yuan 0.32 Yuan</p>
<p>Note: Estimated value is the price assessed by the Paper Industry Association, which is the standard for general market prices.</p>
<p>Recently, various paper prices have shown a slight downward trend due to sluggish sales, especially Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper, because the domestically produced Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper are also very fine and can compete with Japanese goods. At present, various manufacturers also intend to compete with Japanese goods, so their market prices have fallen more. The latest survey results are listed below:</p>
<p>Da Zhonghua Su Shi, from 3.10 yuan to 3.60 yuan per ream, the selling price of Mao Bian is the same.</p>
<p>Baoshan Su Shi and Mao Bian, the top grade is 3.56 yuan per ream, the middle grade is 3.23 yuan, and the bottom grade is 2.90 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lian Shi, from 3 yuan to 3.50 yuan per ream, Mao Bian, from 3.10 yuan to 3.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Yuan Tai Sen Ji Lian Shi Mao Bian sells for 3.10 yuan to 3.20 yuan per ream.</p>
<p>The selling price of Jiangnan Lian Shi Mao Bian is still the price set in August last year. The smallest Lian Shi is 3.75 yuan per ream, and the largest is 4.67 yuan, which is about one yuan higher than the products of other factories.</p>
<p>Tian Zhang Chang Ji Daolin paper sells for 0.11 yuan per pound (less commission), the price of drawing paper is the same as the price of writing paper.</p>
<p>Long Zhang Daolin paper, 0.18 yuan per pound (less 96 or 97 discount, paper merchants can get a discount when buying goods from the company). The selling price of Lian Shi produced by the company also varies from 6.50 yuan to 13.10 yuan per piece due to different packaging (some are 10 knives per piece, some are 15 knives per piece, and the most are 44 knives per piece).</p>
<p>Mei Jin Small Waxed Paper sells for 10 yuan per ream, Yellow Paperboard sells for more than 80 yuan per ton (wholesale price 74 yuan), and Gray Newsprint sells for 2.20 yuan per ream (wholesale price 2 yuan).</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of Lian Shi Mao Bian have been very good. It is said that the sales of ordinary goods with low prices are the most (such as those selling for 3 yuan to 3.12 yuan). Various paper mills are rushing to manufacture due to insufficient supply, which is very busy. Among them, Baoshan, Da Zhonghua, and Shanghai factories are the most developed. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e166">Liang Weichu Was Slashed Fourteen Times by Enemies. The Bloody Case in Front of the Shanghai Grand Theater. Dying, Reportedly Due to a Love Triangle. <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Liang Weichu, a Cantonese man, 26 years old, lived at No. 15, Shutahe Lane, Beishansi Road. Yesterday afternoon, Liang and one or two friends went to the Shanghai Grand Theater at the intersection of Beisichuan Road and Qiujiang Road to watch a movie. Waiting until 4:40 PM, after watching the movie, he went out. Unexpectedly, just as he was about to exit, stepping down the stone steps, and turning the corner, three or four teenagers protruded from the corner of the wall, holding sharp axes, and slashed at Liang. Liang was caught off guard and was hit four times in the right hand, seven times in the left leg, and three times in the head. Blood poured out immediately, and he fell to the ground dying. The murderer, seeing that the goal had been achieved, fled into the alley. His friend rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but never reported it to the police. Therefore, the hospital immediately notified the police station and sent detectives to the hospital to investigate. Because the friend was very suspicious, he was summoned to the police station for interrogation. It is reported that it was caused by a love triangle. The police station is still investigating strictly.</p>

<p>After the central government decided to allocate 90,000 yuan to Yunnan Province from the frontier education assistance fund for the 24th year, the provincial Department of Education used 24,000 yuan to establish Miao elementary schools and 25,000 yuan to train Miao teachers.

The aim is to gradually improve the level of education and culture in the area so that it becomes the same as in the inland areas. Provincial simplified normal schools will also be established in Deqin (Atuntze), Tengyue, Mianning, or Zhenkang, Cheli, Kaihua, etc., to offer regular classes or first one-to-two-year teacher training classes, and attached elementary schools will be established. Provincial elementary schools will be established in Zhongdian, Weixi, Fugong, Gongshan, Bijiang, Lanping, Luyong, Lianghe, Yingjiang, Luxi, Lianshan, Longchuan, Ruili, Zhenkang, Shuangjiang, Lancang, Cangyuan, Ningjiang, Dashun, Fohai, Nanjiao, Zhenyue, Jiangcheng, Jinping, Hekou, Qiubei, Fuzhou, Yanshan, and Dachengba, and one-to-two-year teacher training classes will also be offered (except for Kaihua, the above-listed schools will all be established and start classes in February of this year).

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>After a few weeks at home, Nat came back to school, looking as if he had recovered from his grief. This was due in no small part to the adaptable nature of childhood. He had certainly recovered to some extent; he did not forget, because his nature was such that whatever happened to him was deeply absorbed, carefully filtered, and then permeated to the innermost spring, to irrigate his sensitive mind and nurture his various small virtues. He played, studied, worked, and sometimes sang, all as usual, and it was not easy for others to guess at what changes had taken place. But there was one person, Aunt Jo, who had seen it, because she watched the boy with all her heart, wanting to take John’s place herself. It was truly a labor of love. He rarely spoke of his loss, but Aunt Jo often heard soft sobs coming from the small bed at night. When she went to comfort him, he would only cry out, "I want my father, oh, I want my father!" — the connection between them was so close and beautiful that when it was broken, the boy's heart was also broken. But "Time" gradually filled his wounds, and he gradually felt that he had not lost his father, but only temporarily hidden him, and that he would see him again one day, just as strong and kind, although his little son would have to see the purple asters bloom and fall many, many times on his father's grave before they could meet again.</p>
<p>The external changes kept pace with the internal changes, because in those few weeks, Nat seemed to have grown up and had begun to abandon his childish games. Not because he was ashamed of them, as some children feel, but because his interests had outgrown them and he needed something more suited to adults. He began to love arithmetic, which he had always hated, and studied it tirelessly. His uncle was pleasantly surprised, but did not understand the source of his new interest until Plum said:</p>
<p>"When I grow up, I want to be an accountant like Dad, so I have to understand arithmetic and things like that, or I won't be able to have his kind of clear and neat books."</p>

<p>Turnover Less Than Three Thousand, Swap Premium Slightly Lower</p>
<p>The gold market showed no sign of improvement yesterday. Transactions were sporadic, with fluctuations of only 1.10 yuan. The future market hovered around 4 jiao. The foreign exchange market eased and the trend weakened slightly. The outlook is bleak. In the early morning, after overseas silver markets saw London fall and the US remain flat, there was talk that there were sellers at the quoted price but no transactions. Monte di Righi silver forward prices fell by 0.05 to 0.10 tael. London spot gold rose by 0.5 pence. Exchange rates were mixed. The Central Bank's quoted price rose to 1147.10 yuan, but due to a lack of interest, no transactions were opened outside the market in anticipation of trading. Transactions began at 9:05 AM, opening at the same price as the previous day. After the opening, prices remained stable. Later, due to large buyers withdrawing and providing supply, the HSBC quoted price, although unchanged, was slightly lower. Banks were selling. The silver balance tax revealed a decrease of 0.025, and the trend was difficult to support, but still hovered. The foreign exchange market remained loose, and selling pressure eventually prevailed, gradually declining. Mobil Oil concluded its purchases of US dollars, and after falling, gradually leveled off. After entering, the demand for supply balanced, and fluctuations were limited. The noon market was also very stable. In the afternoon, the market situation seemed stable, with fluctuations of only 0.04 jiao.

<p>Bond Prices Remain Strong, Not Declining</p>
<p>Shorts Believe the Bulls Will Cover</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely quiet, and market sentiment continued to weaken. Those holding physical stocks were trying to sell them off-market, but there were no buyers. On the exchange floor, the shorts remained inactive while the longs were selling, but there were few new buyers. The shorts likely had already delivered their physical stocks, and if the market price fell to a reasonable level, they could profit. However, because they could not re-sell after buying back, they were unwilling to let go easily. The possibility of banks reducing interest rates was already apparent. Foreign banks had already reduced deposit rates, capping them at 5 percent. Chinese banks were still observing. If bond prices are not maintained, prices for Class E bonds may fall to around 55 percent of face value. Yesterday, there were still four trades, each with a downward trend. Although some stocks rebounded slightly by a few cents, there was no sign of a reversal. The amount of money in exchange accounts was still over 50 million. If selling pressure increases, the decline will intensify. The market price results showed a unanimous decline, ranging from a little over one yuan to as much as two yuan and seven jiao compared to the previous day. The total volume was 7.98 million yuan. The following is a comparative table of the gains and losses: (Unit: yuan, Trading Unit: hundred yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market saw foreign longs liquidate due to unfavorable Liverpool news. However, most of these positions were absorbed by fellow traders, leading prices to range from unchanged to down six points. New speculative buying was lacking. Longs feared government sales and continued to liquidate. Some producers who were stockpiling cotton sought to hedge their spot positions in the market but encountered difficulty due to limit orders. Later, prices weakened again due to cotton farmers rushing to sell. Fortunately, fellow traders bought heavily at 11.01 cents in the March contract, managing to hold the line. The closing was stable, with the March contract rising slightly while the remaining contracts fell 5 to 7 points. Spot prices fell by 5 points. British spot cotton was unchanged, while futures fell 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton saw short selling and long liquidation in the morning, which was met with speculative buying.

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months continued to increase, with foreign wheat quoted at 1 jiao for Chicago and 48 cents for Canadian. Market sentiment was that foreign wheat was slightly better, and the cold weather was hindering transportation. As a result, speculators were quite active, and near term prices rose rapidly. The new flour from June and July was further out in time, and rumors of foreign wheat orders resulted in only minor increases. In the afternoon, trading remained active, but the market was hovering due to some longs taking profits. The current situation is that inventories are not particularly high, and sales are not booming, so there are few major fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Wheat is Driven by Flour <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>

Looking at the future, if the rumors of foreign wheat orders are true, long-term prices may fall together. The spot wheat market remained stable. Open Yao Bay wheat at 5.25 yuan, Xiao Gan wheat at 5.05 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 5.23 yuan, and Xianghe wheat at 5 yuan. A total of 1,500 bags were handled by Fuxin.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various groups were still not numerous, totaling over thirty merchants (with a total of 6,000 shis). However, local sales were still sluggish, and Qingdao groups only purchased 2,000 bags. As a result, the market was barely stable, and the situation seemed to be softening. The price of thick early japonica rice was quite volatile, and thin rice was also stable. The price of Zao Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan was similar.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 26 or 27 arrivals from various routes along the river.

<p>Yesterday's foreign sugar market continued to soften due to weak demand.

<p>February Standard Oil Rises to 18 Yuan, An Increase of One Yuan from the Weekend Close</p>
<p>Yesterday's standard oil soybean cake market saw prices rise uniformly after the morning opening. The price in Dalian was rising sharply. There was an earlier ban on the export of various grains in Dalian to supply the local people and military needs, and a certain party took the opportunity to absorb as much as possible. The future availability of goods from Dalian was questionable, leading to more anxious sentiment. Buying interest from Dalian merchants was even stronger, and speculators were especially panicked.

<p>With foreign silk prices falling frequently (yesterday New York spot prices fell 5.5 cents, and Yokohama spot prices fell 20 yuan), the Shanghai market was even more lifeless.

<p>Southern sugar arrowheads, which had seen sluggish sales and prices as low as 56 to 57 yuan in the past, recently experienced a sudden surge. With the sugar cane harvest in Xinghua being abundant, the people had more money in hand after selling and bought these products as supplements, resulting in strong demand. Prices rose to 80 yuan, with some sellers calling for 85 to 86 yuan. Clean pond arrowheads sold for 23 to 24 yuan, also up 1 to 2 yuan. Ordinary pond arrowheads were cheaper, selling for 17 to 18 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Silk Industry in the Past Year (Continued Part 2) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Tianyu</p>
<p>Shanghai exported 48,088 bales of raw silk in the eleven months from January to November, more than double the amount from last year. Guangdong, on the other hand, saw a decrease in exports, with only 18,192 bales. Domestic sales were approximately 10,000 bales, a 50% decrease from last year.</p>
<p>In summary, although the silk industry in 1935 went from a depression in the first half of the year to a boom in the second half, domestic workers were mostly rejoicing. However, under such favorable conditions, many silk factories were forced to close due to a lack of raw materials. This was because: first, the stagnation of silk sales and the sharp fall in silk prices in recent years led to a widespread aversion to sericulture among farmers, resulting in the felling of mulberry trees and planting of crops, reducing mulberry orchards in Jiangsu and Zhejiang by about one-third. Second, the government restricted the production of various silk worm species in 1935, having learned a lesson from the oversupply of autumn seeds in the autumn of 1934, without considering that the previous lesson was under special drought conditions. This resulted in an unprecedented shortage of silk worm eggs, with farmers raising silk worms but lacking the silk worm eggs to feed them. Therefore, although the silk industry in 1935 had a more favorable opportunity, the problem of raw material production became the only regret.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>We know that the rise in silk prices in 1935 was mainly due to the stimulus of increased consumption, but other negative reasons also contributed to the fluctuation of silk prices. We can divide this into several aspects:</p>
<p>The first is the turning point in the world economy. The world economy's transition from "panic" to "depression" was not a normal turning point, but rather a boom in military demand triggered by the "gunpowder smell" of international instability and heightened contradictions. This boom was not enough to drive the entire economy, but it stimulated a small increase in silk consumption. The increase in US consumption cannot be said to be due to this. The proportion of unemployed workers joining the labor union alliance rebounded and decreased, and the number of workers employed in all factories also increased slightly. Although it was not as good as in 1930, the slight decrease in unemployment was enough to increase consumption. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Women's Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Modern Standard Woman <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Women's liberation is generally described as "going to serve society." Indeed, women serving society is liberation, but it is a mistake to limit the word "liberation" solely to serving society. In my opinion, it is right for women to adequately serve society under the banner of liberation. However, if liberation is solely equated with serving society as a woman's only duty, and everything else is disregarded, then that is wrong.</p>
<p>An example occurred recently in the family of a friend of mine. My friend's wife is a new woman who received a full education and has also led small-scale women's movements. After marrying my friend, she took a job at an organization immediately after their honeymoon. At home, they have two maids responsible for washing and cooking. As for herself, in her spare time, she only drags her husband out to play. If her husband is not happy to go, she goes out alone.</p>
<p>My friend, though not stubborn, enjoys a leisurely family life. Initially, he thought that after marrying her, they could enjoy some marital happiness after finishing their work, but after marriage, his wife still loved to play so much that he inevitably found it quite distressing. So, he slightly advised her. Little did he know that he would greatly offend his wife, who said, "If you want a wife who is like a slave, you should look for her in the countryside."</p>
<p>After being married for a year, she suddenly became pregnant last autumn. My friend had always felt too lonely at home, so he was very happy to learn that she was pregnant. Unexpectedly, after a few days, she secretly had an abortion. My friend strongly disapproved, and the feelings between the two gradually deteriorated. His wife's only reason was, "Asking me to be a virtuous mother and good wife of the 19th century is out of the question."</p>
<p>From this example, it seems that "virtuous mother and good wife" is not worth half a penny in the eyes of modern women. However, look, there is a widespread slogan in Germany now, "Women return to the family." Returning to the family, what do they do? Naturally, it is "managing household affairs" and "raising children." "Managing household affairs" and "raising children," although not directly serving society, are indirectly contributing to the survival of the nation. And in practice, it may be more effective than directly serving society.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia, as we have always known, is a socialist country that does not pay attention to the family system. Soviet women work the same as men. However, according to recent surveys, the government has restricted behaviors that damage family organization, such as divorce, abortion, and neglecting child support. At the same time, families preparing their own meals have also increased considerably. The business of more than 200 workers' dormitories and more than 300 public canteens in Moscow and its suburbs has declined by about 40% compared to three years ago. Nurseries, however, are developing day by day. From this, we can also see the understanding of family life among Soviet women in general.</p>
<p>Japanese women, although all those under the age of 40 have received a Western education, are all worthy of being called virtuous mothers and good wives. Although women's employment in Japan is much more developed than in our country, after their social service time is over, they return home to "manage household affairs," "raise children," and live a harmonious family life with their husbands.</p>
<p>The wife of President Roosevelt in the White House, during working hours, is an assistant to the President in handling government affairs; outside of working hours, she is the chief person responsible for the family, who declines all visits. From the President's health to the cleanliness of the house, she is responsible. It is said that when there is a banquet in the White House, the First Lady often goes to the kitchen to cook herself.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that modern women with knowledge should not consider themselves remarkable simply because they can serve society. To be a remarkable modern woman, one should also serve the family in addition to serving society.</p>
<p>In society, be a professional woman; in the family, be a virtuous mother and good wife. This is the modern standard woman.</p>
<h3 id="e215">American Women's "Difficulty in Choosing a Husband" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Tun</p>
<p>In the United States, although the number of boys and girls born is almost equal, women generally feel a fear of lacking "good husbands." It seems that there is a surplus of women. This phenomenon is certainly not biological.</p>
<p>In terms of general phenomena in world history, superior men are generally more numerous than women. And low-ability men, such as idiots, are also more numerous than men. These low-ability men are not physiologically incapable of marriage. However, they are generally abandoned by women and become single widowers.</p>
<p>The main reasons why there is a perceived lack of suitable men to be husbands are: first, the husband's talent must be higher than the wife's so as not to have the feeling of a phoenix following a crow; second, the wife's age must be younger than the husband's so that the husband leads and the wife follows; third, women who have received higher education have overly strict standards for choosing a partner, and the other party is likely to feel unworthy.</p>
<p>From these points of view, it is clear that women who have "difficulty in choosing a husband" in their hearts are mostly women who have received higher education. According to statistics from many universities and specialized schools, less than half and more than a quarter of female graduates remain single for life. These women who have received higher education feel the pain of lifelong loneliness; and society also invisibly loses so many virtuous wives and good mothers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most women who have received a considerable education are prepared to dedicate themselves to society after graduation, but most women's occupations are nothing more than teachers, nannies, nurses, librarians, and so on. In these situations, unmarried men do not necessarily make up the majority. In addition, women like to be self-regarding and are unwilling to easily embark on a romantic path. And most men's choice of a partner does not necessarily welcome upright women. They use women's love of vanity to their advantage, some using seduction, and some simply amounting to abduction. The more self-regarding a woman is, the more difficult it is to get close to men.</p>
<p>Conversely, ordinary women's criteria for choosing a partner are naturally less demanding, and they may even lower their standards. The possibility of marriage is naturally greater. As for those women who have received higher education and harbor extravagant hopes, they initially raise their standards for choosing a partner too high. When their wishes are not fulfilled and they get older, they realize that youth does not wait for them, lower their standards, but the other party may not be willing to compromise because of the age difference.</p>
<p>The average age of marriage in the United States is 25 for men and 21 for women. Women who graduate from college are almost two or three years past the average marriage age. But men always choose women who are two or three years younger than themselves. Women in their mid-twenties can only marry men over 30. Moreover, women with higher ambitions always like to work for a few years after graduating from college, earning some income to prepare for marriage; or even pay off the debts they incurred while studying. Year after year, they delay, and the age standard for marriage becomes further and further away. According to statistics from Dr. Tamblin of Kyoto Life Insurance Company: women at the age of 20 have an average of two to three marriage opportunities within ten years. Women at the age of 30 have a half of a marriage opportunity within ten years. As a result, a large number of talented women remain single and lonely, embracing the bright moon for the rest of their lives!</p>
<p>In short, if a woman who has received a considerable education wants to enjoy a normal married life, she must be realistic and choose a partner at the right time before the age of 20, and never easily miss the precious time of youth.</p>

<h3 id="e216">An Interview with the Humorous Master Lin Yutang and His Wife (Part 2) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin is a humorous writer, may I ask what criticisms you have of modern women?"</p>
<p>He thought for a moment, then smiled at his wife again, and the words came: "I think women who like to show off are bad! Generally, good women don't like to show off, they just raise children silently at home, fulfilling their great mission. Is being a new virtuous wife and good mother not a noble vocation? Because men cannot do the work of being a wife and mother at home, it can only be done by women. So a woman must be a virtuous wife and good mother, and a man must be a virtuous husband and good father." He paused for a while, and said again: "The women who show off the most in politics are the worst, but they are not enough to represent the new women." After he finished speaking, his wife expressed her opposition, saying, "You are going too far, no wonder the tabloids are spreading rumors about you." He said, "It's a fact, not an exaggeration."</p>
<p>"According to this, what should Mr. Lin's ideal new woman be like?"</p>
<p>He laughed, as if it were difficult to answer; after a while, he said eloquently: "This is too long to say, how can it be finished in a few words?"</p>
<p>"I have no choice but to combine a thousand sentences into one, please shorten it," I said.</p>
<p>"Okay! My ideal new woman, first of all, must be healthier than before; second, Chinese women are all dependent, lacking the independent spirit of Western women, which may be the result of social attitudes oppressing them. Chinese women are not as lively as Western women, but their quiet and peaceful attitude is better than theirs; future women should combine the two; third, sexual morality should be more liberated than it is now, I oppose men being able to liberate their sexual desires, being able to prostitute, being able to divorce and remarry, while women cannot be free. Some people say that liberating women's sexual morality will make social customs worse, which is a biased view, and it would be too cruel and unfair to place the responsibility for ruining social customs on women. In short, to liberate women, we must first correct social attitudes. The Hong Jian Yuan's remarriage caused a sensation in the whole society, and everyone attacked her, which led to her leaving the country. How can this be reasonable!</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Lin's words came to an end. I talked to his wife for a long time. First I asked, "What attitude does Mrs. Lin take towards Mr. Lin?" "Both parties take a cooperative attitude. I am fully responsible for household affairs, and more important matters are discussed together and decided upon."</p>
<p>"Please tell us about your experience in managing a household."</p>
<p>"Household affairs are not about experience. I would like to talk about four points in a random way: First, I advocate open family finances. Large families often cheat on finances and accumulate private savings, which results in various tragedies; second, determine the budget and final accounts, and expenditures should not exceed the budget, so that household affairs will not be chaotic; third, cultivate children's automatic habits from an early age, do not rely on servants, and develop their common nature, do not use brute force; if children make mistakes, use appropriate methods to make them aware; do not often scold them, too much scolding will lose its effect; sometimes you can use other people's affairs to indirectly teach; fourth, children should be independent. My two thorns in the flesh studied in the United States and Germany for many years, and took care of cooking and laundry themselves. Although servants are now doing it for them, they must always take a supervisory attitude, because family hygiene is the most important thing for food, and if it is entrusted to others, it will not be reliable."</p>
<p>"What is your opinion on the new-style family?"</p>
<p>"I agree with the small family system, because it is economically independent, does not rely on others, does not shirk responsibility, can develop the ability of housewives, and there is no possibility of conflict between new and old opinions, which are unmatched by large families. However, it is one's duty to support one's parents, and one must not be negligent. I think that no matter how new or old, large or small the family is, housewives must not shirk their natural duty to take care of the family, must not have excessive entertainment; must not wear strange and gaudy clothes that do not fit their status; must not neglect the education of boys and girls; in addition to family affairs, must not forget the desire for knowledge and the public welfare of society."</p>
<p>"What kind of entertainment does madam do every day?" At this time, Mr. Lin put down his pen and snatched to say: "We walk in the suburbs every day, play with the children, don't often watch movies, occasionally go dancing, often attend friends' banquets, and there's nothing else."</p>
<p>Unintentionally, we talked for an hour and a half. Everyone is busy, so I had to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Corrigenda: In the previous issue, in the first line of this article, "On the eve of my visit," there is an extra word "we" under the word "I"; in the fifteenth line, "My government and people," the symbol "　" is wrongly printed as "etc."; in the twenty-third line, "Mrs. Lin interjected," interjected is wrongly written as "broadcast," especially corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Beauty and Crime <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Fang</p>
<p>In "Sexual Selection," the beautiful ones are the winners. In general, people have a love for beauty, and for ugly women, they feel disgust and displeasure. Therefore, people generally treat beauty with great tolerance and kindness, and treat ugly women with excessive coldness and meanness. No matter when or where, beautiful women are often welcomed by many opposite sexes and easily obtain sexual satisfaction, while ugly women are the opposite.</p>
<p>Precisely because beautiful women easily win the hearts of the opposite sex and receive generous treatment in society, it often causes them to fall into the dangers of daily life. Poisonous women and femme fatales mostly belong to beautiful women, which is very obvious. To investigate the reason, it can be analyzed into six points: First, people generally treat beautiful women with great forgiveness. Second, beautiful women are aware that they are "winners of sexuality," and tend to be negligent in daily life. Third, beautiful women easily obtain the love and hospitality of others, and easily develop various social relationships. Fourth, beautiful women are mostly slaves of vanity. Fifth, beautiful women easily provoke the temptation of the opposite sex and commit mistakes in terms of sex. Sixth, beautiful women waste more on decorations and clothing than ugly slaves.</p>
<p>Moreover, beautiful women often make men willing to be their protectors, and they are obedient to their orders. And the general public in society are mostly fooled by their beauty, mistakenly believing that such beautiful women would not commit terrible crimes.</p>
<p>The above are the reasons that make it easy for beautiful women to do wrong. Secondly, they often fall into great misfortune or commit great mistakes due to the opposite sex. Beautiful women are often the focus of attention of the opposite sex, causing many men who admire them to compete. Because of love disputes, on the one hand, they are suspected by women of the same sex, and on the other hand, they are jealous of the opposite sex, which is more intense than ordinary greed, and therefore the danger they are exposed to is even greater. There are very many tragedies of injury and murder that occur due to disputes between men and women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, men protecting beautiful women may be harmless in many places, but if a vicious man has a beautiful wife, he often uses her beauty to boast to the world, and thus indulges in his evil deeds. "Behind every great crime, there is a woman," this saying contains truth, meaning that women are directly or indirectly related to evil, especially saying that beautiful women easily make men commit greater crimes.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Women's Issues in Ballads <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>"Oh mother, you have a hard heart, selling me out to be a maid! Wearing rags, eating thin vegetable soup, sleeping on a broken bed, walking in a dark alley, suffering unjust beatings, the landlord is greedy and hard-hearted, selling me out again to be a concubine, the first wife is fierce and domineering, often suppressing my anger in my chest."</p>
<p>The above ballad is popular in my hometown of Nanhui. If we carefully study this ballad and think about it, we really feel that every word is sad and pitiable, which is indeed a problem that the women's world should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The slave system, according to the meaning of human equality, is really an unreasonable thing, and it is also an illegal thing. Buying other people's daughters as their own slaves, if they can treat them well and educate them well, make them a successful poor person, and enable them to enjoy various human rights and treatments, that's fine. Now, in many wealthy families with a little money, how many families can jump out of the scope of this ballad in terms of the treatment of slaves? It is very heartbreaking and infuriating for those of us who care about the women's movement!</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw in the newspaper that the Guangdong women's world, in order to oppose the slave system, launched a week of anti-slave movement propaganda. In this week of anti-slave movement propaganda, they vigorously carried out anti-slave propaganda work, which is really good news for the maids who are trapped in the eighteenth layer of hell. I hope that the leading figures in the women's world who have status and ability in society will not ignore this issue, and will continue to catch up and do this anti-slave movement with great significance?</p>
<h3 id="e219">Discussion on the Economic Problems of Small Families <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Small families are built on an economic foundation, everyone agrees with this! Reading Ms. Qian Ziting's "Economic Problems of Small Families," I can't help but sigh! Although the author is a man, he is responsible for the family's finances, and he also deeply feels the difficulty in this autumn of expensive rice and firewood! With the income of Ms. Qian's husband, it is really like using a cup of water to put out a burning cart of firewood, which is very difficult to deal with!</p>
<p>I and my wife Xiujuan discussed this issue and believe that under the principle of only two people in Ms. Qian's couple, the allocation of twenty yuan can be a humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>First, food expenses: 10 yuan</p>
<p>Second, rent: 6 yuan (small room)</p>
<p>Third, water and electricity: 2 yuan</p>
<p>Fourth, pocket money: 2 yuan</p>
<p>According to what is written above, the item of clothing is still missing. In the environment of the 20th century, using the austerity method of the 18th century, it really feels painful! But in the luxurious ten-mile foreign field, how can we not be tempted by the environment! It is best to have a firm will! With Ms. Qian's clear talent, she may write articles or do family handicrafts, such as sewing, which is the best way to increase income, so that both husband and wife can share the economic burden equally! At least it will be beneficial to subsidize the family economy! What does Ms. Qian think of this?</p>

<p>— Qin Wang Yin Jiu</p>
<p>That day, no matter if it was spring or summer, there would always be such a day! The little mute, who was not afraid of anything, even Liu the madman, who was afraid of seeing people on the street, suddenly revealed an unexpected weakness in front of a tofu shop. He was first squatting on the street teasing a puppy, looking very happy, his bird-black face full of mischievous and lovely smiles; the corner of his clothes was completely covered in a pool of dirty water and he didn't even notice, his body was still bending backwards, his back almost touching the surface of the water, and the dog was lying on his chest. People who were used to seeing him like this were smiling at him, but unexpectedly, the child suddenly jumped up as if he had been electrocuted, let go of the dog, his face turned ashen, as if he had been greatly frightened, he held his head in his hands, and desperately jumped into the counter of the tofu shop, hiding behind a clerk, hugging the person's waist tightly, shaking all over; of course, everyone was alarmed by this!</p>
<p>"Hey! Why is this child so scared?"</p>
<p>Some people were asking each other; but the clerk in the tofu shop felt very sorry for him, and hurriedly turned around and comforted them:</p>
<p>"Don't panic! What did you see that made you so scared?"</p>
<p>"A snake! A snake!"</p>
<p>In this way, everyone knew that this mysterious wild child was so frightened because he saw a small snake.</p>
<p>The next day, he came to the market again. Some people deliberately wanted to test him. They first bought a three- or four-foot-long fire-red snake that had its teeth pulled out from a beggar, and deliberately threw it near him, while shouting:</p>
<p>"Oh dear! The snake is coming! The snake is coming!"</p>
<p>This time, the mute was even more frightened. He ran all the way back, crying so hard that he could hardly breathe; from that day on, he didn't dare to go out for a full month, and the errand of going to the street to buy things was once again taken over by his father! That officer of unknown name! took on the task of going.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Pathology of Leukorrhea (Vaginal Discharge) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>This disease, in terms of its location, can be divided into uterine corpus leukorrhea, vestibular leukorrhea, cervical leukorrhea, and vaginal leukorrhea. Generally, it is mostly the result of inflammation. It often flows out as a purulent secretion. When sperm encounters it, it is immediately killed. Therefore, it is the most prominent and significant cause of infertility in women.</p>
<p>Women, restricted by their environment and bound by etiquette, often regard leukorrhea as a secret and hidden disease. They have no way to take medicine, let alone consult a doctor. They hide and delay, which not only makes their bodies lose their health and beauty and their hopes of pregnancy disappear, but also causes hundreds of diseases due to the impact of inflammation, and the losses are particularly severe.</p>
<p>The treatment methods for this disease are numerous. The general methods commonly used include systemic therapy, local washing, external vulvar drying, and biological therapy.</p>
<h3 id="e223">(Doctor's Report) Secret Self-Treatment for Leukorrhea <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(Report by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan) The patient, Mrs. Qin Qihang, has suffered from leukorrhea for years. She hid it and didn't tell anyone, and the disease lingered. Her husband hated her and her mother-in-law mocked her. She was mentally distressed. Hundreds of diseases occurred. Her muscles were emaciated. After a long marriage, she was infertile. There was no hope for offspring. Her husband used this as an excuse to openly propose taking a concubine. She was stimulated in her heart. She wanted to go crazy. Last summer, her cousin-in-law suffered from menstrual irregularities and stomach pain, and I treated her with "Female Reproductive Element" and "Stomach Pain Reliever" and cured her. So she asked her companion to come to me for treatment. After instructing her to purchase "Female Reproductive Element" from Taihe Pharmacy for systemic therapy, I also instructed her to use "Therapeutic Discharge Elixir" externally at home for self-treatment according to the law. "Therapeutic Discharge Elixir" is mainly composed of lactobacilli, bacilli, and liver starch. It is a good medicine for biological therapy. It has the function of searching for discharge and purifying toxins. It does not require washing but also has the advantages of washing. After use, the vaginitis disappears, and the redness recedes. It is clean and dry. It also deeply conforms to the principles of drying therapy. The two medicines are used internally and externally, which has the advantage of gathering the strengths of all methods. It can also be used for secret self-treatment at home, which is suitable for the women's environment. In just four weeks, the leukorrhea was cleared up early. Her body recovered. Her breasts were plump. She recovered the youth and beauty of a young woman. The relationship between husband and wife also turned harmonious. It was better than a new marriage. The proposal to take a concubine disappeared on its own. Recently, she introduced her cohabiting Mrs. Bao to treat the same hidden disease. I saw that her abdomen was bulging.

<p>(Report by Dr. Qiao Wenbin) The patient, Xu Jixian, committed masturbation when he was young, resulting in spermatorrhea. After marriage, he overworked and also suffered from premature ejaculation. The medicine was not effective. It had no effect at all. He mistakenly took a stimulant. The disease became more severe. His wife ridiculed him. There was no hope for offspring. He was mentally depressed. His body was weak. Last autumn, he began to seek treatment from me. I diagnosed that Mr. Xu's reproductive glands were more decadent than usual. Ordinary life-saving and endocrine preparations could not work. It would not be effective without using a large number of reproductive gland endocrine preparations. So I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Element" from Yong'an Company to restore his reproductive glands. In order to treat the symptoms and root causes at the same time, I instructed him to purchase "Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" with the words "Hemitol's" and take them together. After taking half a dozen of them continuously, the spermatorrhea was cured early. Premature ejaculation was also cured. His spirit was refreshed. His muscles were plump. His body was strong and healthy. His vitality was revived, as if he had been reborn.</p>

<p>Opium contains toxins. Occasional use seems to have the effect of relieving pain and excitement. If it is used for a long time, it will become addictive. Not only will the dose increase frequently, but its effect will also be lost. Most smokers are addicted to its current soothing and pain-relieving effect, which leads to addiction over time. They do not know that the pain relief of opium is like a mask, and the excitement accumulated over time will turn into numbness. Not only can it not cure diseases, but it also makes the toxins of opium clog the organs and harm the whole body. If one does not smoke occasionally, the smoking addiction will erupt, and the spirit will not be smooth. This is why it is not easy to quit.</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. Wang Shiying) Last autumn, Mrs. Yan Kuixin was introduced to me by a close relative for treatment. She complained of stomach and abdominal pain, as well as a deep smoking addiction. I observed that Mrs. Yan's past health and beauty had been lost to illness and hidden by her smoking appearance. Not only did she suffer from gastritis and uterine cold, but also her internal reproductive gland secretions were greatly depleted. I immediately instructed her to purchase and take "Female Reproductive Essence" from Zhengwei Pharmacy to supplement her reproductive gland secretions. The toxins from smoking would be removed naturally, and her addiction would be broken immediately. I also prescribed "Stomach Pain Relief" for her stomach problems and "Stomach Strengthening Essence" to strengthen her stomach. "Female Reproductive Essence" also has the effect of nourishing and revitalizing, warming the uterus and restoring youth. Therefore, it can achieve the miraculous effect of safely quitting smoking. Her ailments have disappeared, her spirits are high, her smoking appearance is gone, and she has regained the youthful beauty of her past.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Song Haoming) Recalling the pain of illness before marriage, even now, I shudder at the thought. Initially, I was led astray by bad friends and mistakenly indulged in masturbation. Relying on my robust health, I did not take care of myself, leading to the destruction of my functions, depletion of essence, and decline of my body. I suffered from dizziness, brain weakness, back pain, and heart palpitations. I began to fear the harm and tried to quit on my own. However, symptoms such as insomnia and seminal emission occurred repeatedly, further depleting my essence and exhausting my body and spirit. I sought treatment in every possible way, but the medicine was not effective. The number of seminal emissions increased, and symptoms of weakness became more frequent. I was entangled in fatigue and waiting to die. The previously scheduled wedding date was approaching, and my heart was pounding like a pestle. Fortunately, an introducer pointed me towards a glimmer of hope and instructed me to seek treatment from Dr. Zhan Nianceng, a specialist in venereal diseases. He identified the source of my illness and told me about treatment methods. He administered electrotherapy and instructed me to purchase and take the famous medicines "Reproductive Essence" and "Hemetol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking them, life began to sprout, and the effects were remarkably evident. I then continued to take them for four weeks with peace of mind, and finally, my essence was abundant, my spirit was full, and all symptoms disappeared, restoring my health. It was like being reborn. If it were not for the famous doctor and famous medicines, I fear I would have already passed away. Overwhelmed with gratitude, I especially write this to express my sincere thanks and to introduce it to those suffering from the same illness, so that they can also enjoy marital bliss.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Zhang Eryong) My cousin, Qiu Jianming, and I both suffered from stomach pain and weakness. We tried many stomach medicines, but none of them had any noticeable effect. They could only provide temporary relief. Once the medicine wore off, the root of the problem remained. We both felt hopeless and thought it was incurable. We took medicine when the illness came, and the illness came back when the medicine wore off. We procrastinated, and our stomachs and bodies became weak. Last month, thanks to an introduction in this publication, my cousin's stomach ailment was radically cured by using "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Essence." Since our symptoms were the same, I thought the medicine would be equally effective. I also purchased the above two medicines from Zhongxi Pharmacy and took them according to the instructions. After taking less than half a dozen doses, I achieved the same satisfactory results. (Omitted portion) My body is strong and healthy, and the credit goes to these medicines. I must truthfully express my gratitude and ask you to publish this in your esteemed publication, which I believe you will not refuse.</p>

His body was weak, and it was difficult to fulfill his marital duties. Last summer, he was introduced by Mr. Mei Lianzhang to seek treatment from me. (Treatment) - I observed that the source of his illness was the destruction of his reproductive glands. In addition to performing the latest scientific surgical electrical treatment, because ordinary health-preserving or endocrine preparations would not be effective, I immediately instructed him to take the reproductive gland endocrine preparation "Reproductive Essence" from Huamei Pharmacy. After taking it, his reproductive glands were revitalized immediately. His strength was restored. The above two symptoms disappeared one after another. He happily thanked me and left.</p>

His academic performance was usually quick and agile, but now it was slow and declining. He suffered from forgetfulness and insomnia. He was in great pain. He repented and quit, but he already suffered from seminal emission. Taking medicine was ineffective, and the frequency increased. His essence was depleted, and his back ached. Numerous signs of decline appeared. His face was yellow and his muscles were thin. The changes in his illness were unpredictable. Until last autumn, a staff member introduced him to my clinic for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e232">The Construction of Cultural National Defense <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, Japan has been paying great attention to the promotion of cultural diplomacy, spreading its culture overseas, which will be one of the important items of Japan's diplomatic policy this year. Foreign Minister Hirota strongly advocated this point in his diplomatic speech at the 68th resolution meeting. As a result of the agreement, it was decided to carry out various cultural activities with an international cultural undertaking fund of one million yuan, seeking cultural friendship and cooperation with countries around the world. This also shows Japan's ability to exert its diplomatic policies.</p>
<p>This makes us think of the necessity of building cultural national defense in our country. Our country's national crisis is getting heavier day by day, and all actions should be aimed at saving the nation and seeking survival. We not only need to have substantial preparations in the military field to make military national defense strong and solid, but also a revival in the cultural field. The revival of culture, imitating Japan's promotion of cultural diplomacy, we are afraid we have no time for this. However, it is a very urgent move to establish a strong cultural national defense domestically. Saving the country is the responsibility of the people of the whole country, and the cultural circles who have the responsibility of leading the society should stand in front and strive hard. This is the era task that people in cultural circles should fulfill.</p>
<p>To save today's dying China, comprehensively observing the public opinions expressed by all parties in the country, the only strategy is to launch a national liberation movement. The construction of cultural national defense should also follow this path. People generally engaged in cultural undertakings must do their utmost to advocate culturally, so that this movement can be realized as soon as possible. Not only to advocate, but also to guide. In our country's national liberation movement, the cultural circles should be the pioneer soldiers.</p>
<p>The resistance to the enemy on January 28 was the first sound of our country's national liberation movement. The student movements launched successively across the country after December 9 are an expansion of this movement. In the future, the responsibility of building cultural national defense can often be shouldered by this kind of movement.</p>
<p>However, how should the construction of cultural national defense be promoted? Regarding this point, it should be explained from all aspects. The education sector must change its education policy and implement education suitable for the national crisis. This matter is currently being researched by the Ministry of Education, and some educators are also enthusiastically discussing it, and there will definitely be considerable results in the future. The press must report accurate news and awaken the public with fair public opinion. Writers must use various methods to stimulate people's awareness of struggle. Other various cultural institutions should also do their part in their respective cultural fields. In short, striving to promote the national salvation movement culturally is the important task that the cultural circles should have in building cultural national defense in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e233">The Teahouse and Its Owner <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when the setting sun shone brightly on the storefront, the waiters began to get busy: carrying water, stoking the stove to make the fire blaze, and also moving tables and chairs. Li Sandie, the owner, sat by the counter, pointing with his mouth. While smoking his dry tobacco pipe. The attitude is calm and leisurely. He looks older than forty, slightly fat, his face is always blood red, and he is also energetic, so looking at him, he seems to be only nearly thirty years old. This is because the teahouse business is booming, and he has better days.</p>
<p>This teahouse is located in the most bustling section of the long street. Although the storefront is not very big, it does not feel crowded to place twenty or so square and round tables. It was opened in the generation of Li Sandie's father, and the days are extremely far away. This oldness lies in the signboard on the door, engraved with the two large convex characters "Jin Xing", because it has been a long time, it has been smoked black by the sunlight and vapor, and it is covered with dust, almost blurring and difficult to recognize what characters are on it.</p>
<p>After taking a full mouthful of smoke, he put away his dry tobacco pipe. After a while, he will be too busy to smoke. Then he will have to use his loud and respectful voice to greet every customer who comes in without stopping.</p>
<p>The first to arrive is always the old man Risheng Bo, with white hair and a thick mustache, the oldest customer in the teahouse. He comes every day and occupies a certain seat. Therefore, almost everyone knows him. He likes to provoke idleness. When he opens his mouth, he is often nagging endlessly. It can be said that he is too verbose, but he is old and has a gentle temperament, so no one dislikes him. Sometimes he also becomes the most popular temporary storyteller in the teahouse.</p>
<p>He walks very slowly. When he comes, he first walks to the counter and nods to the owner, Li Sandie. Then he takes out a dry tobacco pipe from the pocket of his half-new long gown and walks to a recognized table next to him, lights a paper roll, and slowly smokes while talking to the owner.</p>
<p>Before long, the teahouse is filled with tea drinkers, and there are no empty seats left.</p>
<p>Some of these people are regular customers, some are occasional travelers who use it as a place to rest their feet, and some are from nearby villages who have finished their work and come to the market to relieve their boredom.</p>
<p>In short, every afternoon, the Jin Xing Teahouse is bustling with an endless stream of footprints until it gradually becomes quiet in the evening.</p>
<p>With so many people, the sound is unusually noisy, and it is almost impossible to hear clearly when speaking face to face. You have to raise your voice, so the air becomes more tense and turbulent. Everyone seems to have a heart that needs to be fully opened and speak freely when they come here. Everyone is so energetic and happy.</p>
<p>Smoke and water vapor fill the surroundings, causing some people to cough and some people's eyes to tear. The waiter is too busy to handle it. This person wants water, and that person wants something. He is still overwhelmed, so this person shouts faster, and that person also shouts faster. At this time, Li, the owner, sits on the counter with an indescribable triumphant expression and has to come down to help.</p>
<p>Risheng Bo smoked his dry tobacco pipe, watched Li Sandie walk closer, and smiled enviously, revealing his yellow teeth:</p>
<p>——Haha! Sandie, business is really good!</p>
<p>Sandie is not only the first to come but also the last to leave. When he leaves, the teahouse is occupied by a silence. The ground is littered with melon seed shells and peanut skins.</p>
<p>The waiter is cleaning up, and Li Sandie is clearing up the accounts. Just that bamboo tube, which is more than five feet high and has a bowl-sized opening, is filled with copper coins to the opening, which is enough to make him indescribably happy and happily drink more white rose wine in the evening.</p>
<p>It is something that no one can imagine to support a family of seven or eight people and still have a surplus by relying on a teahouse with a hollow facade. The people in the village are all envious.</p>
<p>After a lot of days, the situation gradually changed.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sun is still the same sun as before, and it still shines on the facade of Jin Xing Teahouse as usual, and Li Sandie also sits in the counter as usual, but he smiles less and frowns more. The customers are getting deserted day by day. At first, he thought the price was too high, so he tried his best to lower it, but the result was that fewer and fewer people drank tea, and the business got worse step by step. So he fired the waiters and only kept an apprentice and himself, but there were only a few people scattered and doing nothing all day long, and they were bored.</p>
<p>As for Risheng Bo, he still comes every day as an exception. And people who were like Risheng Bo some time ago have not been seen for a long time. Seeing that scene and thinking of the past situation, Risheng Bo would sigh and say:</p>
<p>——The year is not good, the days are hard, and even the money for a few cups of tea has to be saved.</p>
<p>The listener, Li Sandie, had nothing to answer, but returned a bitter and resentful look.</p>
<p>Like other shops on the street, the once prosperous Jin Xing Teahouse has gradually declined since then.</p>

<p>Home, home, sweet home.</p>
<p>There is no place more lovely than home,</p>
<p>There is no place more lovely than home. — Ballad.</p>
<p>The dim sky was taut with a cheerless face. And it began to cry again. Tears hung down in rows. — At this time, it was raining.</p>
<p>Two young lads turned into that small tavern together. They sat down in the corner. …</p>
<p>The waiter brought up the plates, and the plates seemed to be steaming. As they picked up their chopsticks, snow also fell mixed in with the rain. Like falling flowers falling from the sky.</p>
<p>The one who put down his chopsticks first looked out the window and said with a sense of feeling,</p>
<p>"Look, it's snowing."</p>
<p>The other one replied.</p>
<p>"I'm really afraid. Every time I see snow, I think of home. — The snow in my hometown is more flavorful. This place is no good, nothing is good. Only people's hearts are much colder than ours."</p>
<p>The one who spoke first was tall, with messy hair, and a pale face with a hint of melancholy. He looked up, and then said,</p>
<p>"Yes, I don't understand why some people here always live such a dull life. —"</p>
<p>"Otherwise, what do you want them to do!"</p>
<p>"Is that all there is to it?" The tall man confronted the other with this question angrily. The man shook his stout body.</p>
<p>"But, what can they do?"</p>
<p>The tall man seemed to be moved by these words and fell silent.</p>
<p>The wind blew a few snowflakes in. On the floor near the shop entrance, there were a few more drops of water. People's feet trampled on it, making it look even more damp and dirty. — The snow here is never as great as in the north. The snow in the south is really an imbecile.</p>
<p>The stout one raised his voice again to break the silence:</p>
<p>"At first, when I first came here, it was okay. In the newspapers, I read with tears in my eyes. On the streets, I ran blindly with the marching crowd. —</p>
<p>"Once, the crowd was clamoring on the street, a large crowd of people of all kinds. A raspy voice shouted enthusiastically, "Welcome the public to participate!" Often, I was full of thoughts…"</p>
<p>He paused slightly. Again,</p>
<p>"That was so good. I squeezed into the crowd and walked along. It was as if I was walking on the official road in my hometown. … I saw a small Western-style building and thought it was my family's tiled house… We walked a lot of roads together, and later I didn't know what road we were on, and the crowd dispersed there. I ran with a hot heart</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Back to the apartment, lying on the bed, always thinking of home, unable to sleep, and kept having insomnia until dawn."</p>
<p>"—"</p>
<p>The tall man did not speak, but his pale face revealed a look of surprise.</p>
<p>The fat man began to sob again.</p>
<p>"Now, you see, the home is gone, where is the second home?…"</p>
<p>Sighing, sadly.</p>
<p>Thinking of home, there are too many beautiful things in my hometown… snow-covered mountain peaks, frozen rivers… thinking like this, two pairs of tired eyes froze…</p>
<p>Quietly silent. Silence spread like smoke again.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. Dusk walked in softly. He covered the sky with his big hands. He was jealous of the day, so he had such a job. However, this was also in vain for him. — The night was about to follow, and soon he would be swallowed up by others.</p>
<p>Outside —</p>
<p>Still, the rain chases the snow, and the snow chases the rain.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is also a bit of wind. — Close your eyes and quietly, you can hear the wind sobbing in the sound of rain and snow dripping.</p>

<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Loneliness, irresistible loneliness, washes over me like a flood.</p>
<p>In this room of mine, there is no animal life other than myself, only the life of a few plants: two pots of maidenhair fern hanging under the beam, two pots of asparagus fern, one of which has little hope of survival, and one pot of plum with withered flowers from last winter, sprouting a few tender greens. I have infinite affection and love for the companions of life in this room. Every night I can forget what the doctor told me I should do, but I never forget the two pots of clear water that these two pots of maidenhair fern deserve. They feel comfortable and at ease in this room of mine, I think. They sprout tender shoots, gradually drooping their green stems, almost reaching the bottom layer of the bookshelf. And surprisingly, they actually bloom with white three-petaled small flowers. So white, so small, hiding behind the dense green leaves, even I didn't notice. When I saw them, several flowers had already withered lonely, such a lonely self-opening and self-falling, which moved me greatly. For the asparagus fern, I also have the greatest expectation and care to serve. I heard that it wants to drink milk, so I asked the neighbor to wash a little water from the empty milk bottle to irrigate it. In this way, I saved a dying Western strain. There are new buds. One morning I found that a pot on this desk had a half-inch of green, pale white new branches; I was surprised by this news of life. This new bud grows unusually fast. I took a joint of an old branch next to it as a size. Every night I can see this soft and plump branch tip, slightly curved towards the sun, pointing to a higher joint of the old branch next to it. Two days later, another new bud broke out of the soil layer, extending its life to the sun in the same posture and speed.</p>
<p>I thought, if I were imprisoned in a prison at this moment, and there was only one person, as long as there was such a little green life accompanying me, as long as I could use the raw materials of my own life to complete another life, I would be joyful, happy and dancing.</p>
<p>My situation is much better than being imprisoned in a prison, and there is already green life accompanying me. But I am lonely. Irresistible emptiness washes over me like a flood.</p>
<p>In the morning, the orange-yellow sun shines on my eyelids, giving me the sour feeling of squeezing the juice from the orange peel and shooting it on my eyelids when I was playing as a child. The color of the morning glow is unpredictably rapid: orange-yellow instantly becomes golden, followed by a string of pigeon bells with a metallic sound. From the rise and fall of the bell sound, I can imagine the dance of the pigeons carrying the golden early sun on my roof, linking together to form a pagoda. The bell sound is faster, I know that they have completed the spire and ascended to the higher distant sky, leaving her at the bottom to indulge my fantasy. So I lotusly sat up: isn't the pagoda also a kind of tomb?</p>
<p>But even the tomb is empty, lonely.</p>

<p>Opening: "Traveling in the Rain"</p>
<p>Dark: Dark clouds fill the sky. Heavy, heavy, heavy rain falls incessantly. Fine, fine, fine rain never stops. Muddy, muddy, muddy, the road is hard to walk. Wind: Sharp, sharp wind assaults the face. Wet, wet, wet soaks the traveler's clothes. Road long, long, long, a thousand miles to traverse. Going, going, going, the journey is difficult. Tears: Tears flow unceasingly. Steps falter, falter, falter, weary feet are exhausted. I resent, resent, resent my family's decline. Anxious, anxious, anxious, each day feels like a year. Helpless, helpless, helpless, yet I must visit my relatives. Parting, parting, parting, leaving my home. Expenses exhausted. Belly empty. Eyes dizzy. Limping, limping. I fear this journey may prevent me from seeing my mother again. I ponder, ponder, ponder, as the sun threatens to set. He is, heartbroken. Gut wrenched. Steps falter, eyes blur. The road slippery, slippery, slippery, the mud engulfs my legs. Strength failing, failing, I collapse in the mud. Breath faint, faint, faint, only a breath remains. Rain pouring, pouring, the rain is even heavier than before. In a hazy dream, my soul returns to my hometown.</p>

<p>Opening: "Bao Yu Cries for Qing Wen"</p>
<p>The best among the maids in the Grand View Garden. Jade shattered, fragrance extinguished, buried beneath the earth. The sentimental young master wails loudly. His heart filled with complaints, all thoughts turned to ashes. Ignorant little maids speak carelessly. They say she, played in the human world for twenty-eight years. A jade maiden descended from the ninth heaven. I cry for you, tranquil, dignified, and virtuous. Suited for anger and laughter, you pleased my heart. I cry for you, intelligent beyond compare, with a clever mind. Extraordinary talent, a great intellect. I cry for you, with a righteous heart, capable like a man. A pure and innocent nature, like a child. Qing Wen ah, which of the four beauties can compare to you? The best of women, ancient and modern. We were together, morning and night, for a few years. Guarding and mending the impure jade, attended by a fairy maiden. Qing Wen ah, sometimes reading aloud on cold winter days. Only you, kept me company all night, unafraid of the cold. Qing Wen ah, sewing the fur coat while sick, your affection was deep. Every stitch, every thread, pleasing to the eye. Qing Wen ah, that old woman Wang deserves to be killed. Spreading rumors, daring to slander. Qing Wen ah, the mistress believed the gossip. Cooking the crane, burning the zither, forcing you to return. I watched silently, not speaking out. It's just like, forcing Yang Guifei to her death at Mawei. Qing Wen ah, you begged in vain, leaving in sorrow. Saying, how could beautiful features be a source of disaster. Qing Wen ah, you returned to your immortal ranks, wronged and full of grievance. Still doing, making a joyful flower goddess, returning the flawless jade. Qing Wen ah, the courtyard is desolate and cold, unnoticed by others. Only I, the master of the Yi Hong Courtyard, know the sorrow. After crying, I burn paper offerings. The dark wind is bleak, the night drawing to a close. My hair stands on end as I quietly return.</p>
