<h3 id="c44">外交的微妙階段 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在匪偽軍第二度猛攻百靈廟之際。在靑島有二千餘日軍登陸。搜抄黨部。逮捕多人之際。在南京的外交塲合。忽然也有了新鮮的發展。據四日中央社東京電。『張外長及川越大使三日晚之突然會見。及南京日大使館所發表之冗長聲明書。均引起此間若千之驚異。』這所謂『驚異。』在許多沒有見到這冗長聲明書的人。一定要莫名其所以。不過就事實看。我們多少能明白其『驚異』的由來。據路透社南京電。三日晚會談時。川越大使以一種文件交與張外長。據云係過去七次談話之總紀錄。但這紀錄與談話事實不符。張外長請川越收回。川越不肯。張外長乃着人送還日使館。使館又送來。我外部又送回。在這期間。日使館卽發表所謂外交聲明書。這以後川越大使卽於五日離京來滬。因爲這樣一幕推讓的喜劇。外間卽傳有談判已吿失敗之說。同時在東京政界。則表示了非常的『驚異。』</p>
<p>何以要驚異呢。爲了對於這文件的議讓嗎。是的但不完全是。爲了顧慮談判的中斷嗎。是的。但也不完全是。我們覺得對方所以要覺得驚異的最大原因。乃是我們已站在堅定的地位。不容有一步的退讓了。中國的億萬民衆正注視着過去七次談判的內容。這不是一紙文伴所能蒙混的。中國的億萬民衆已堅定地站在綏省健兒的背後。談判的中斷並不是我們所顧忌的。這樣。過去在塘沽河北談判中感到輕而易舉的外交家。忽然遇到了棘手的經騐。這是東京政界所以發生驚異的原因吧。</p>
<p>不過就實際情形講。現階段的中日外交。確巳到了十分微妙的程度。這種狀態。我們不能不密切注意和凖備着的。關於談判的進行。據東京消息和川越大使的表示。還是不擬放棄。但是在今後的談判中。是否要以這次所謂冗長的聲明書作根據呢。目前全中國人民所關心的。就是談判必須在對等的地位進行。而不容有偏面的壓迫。我們的立塲當以收回失去主權爲先。而不容再有主權的喪失。這兩種原則。我們的對方是否已有充分的了解呢。</p>
<p>自然。對於這所謂冗長的聲明書。我們人民也必然懷看不少的驚異的。更値得我們驚異的。是一面有外交的談判在進行。另一面却有同一對方的飛機坦克在進攻百靈廟。同一對方的大批軍隊侵入我們的靑島。這是何等可驚異的外交方式呢。</p>
<p>然而在驚異之中。我們却不怕。因爲我國的千萬軍民巳經站得很堅定。不能再退讓一步了。</p>

<p>廿九日上午十時零四分，我們一行七人，踏上了平綏路的旅程，燕大綏遠抗戰後援會，於停課兩天中，由同學，手製的衛生包萬件，也隨着我們向前方輸送了。</p>
<p>三等車中，旅客異常擁擠，每個人蒙裏着厚厚的衣裝，顚立在人叢裏，都感着有點汗流浹背，然而列車長却給予意外的優待，讓我們搬到頭等車上去了，途中經過十九小時，未曾蒙受到預想中的旅人之苦，我們有着慚愧與不安　而列車長的盛意是異常可感的。</p>
<p>三十日侵晨五時，我們安然到了歸綏，踏上這舉世矚目的光榮的土地，心裏浮　泛着興奮的歡喜，九時至省府謁見當局，陳明我們燕大新聞系同學，爲了介紹國入以渴望中的戰地情况而有戰地調查團的組織。同時我們帶來了八百同學衷誠的敬仰，對於這裏保衛國土的忠勇的戰士們。</p>
<p>綏遠的民團訓練得非常好，這是一支强固的民衆力量，這力量在紅格爾圖的抗戰中，曾勇奮地表現出來。不久，我們打算到小校塲民團訓練處去看看，並願意知道他們訓練的內容與方法。</p>
<p>這地方很寗謐　人民都有着一副沉靜的臉，遠方的人跑來看到這情形時，幾乎會不相信邊境上正有着抗敵的戰爭。</p>
<p>百靈廟攻下後，什麼人都談得眉飛色舞，各方慰勞電慰勞品的、來臨，大有應接不暇之勢。因此在剿匪總指揮部底下特設了一個軍民聯合會，綜理這些事情，並招待遠來的慰勞人員。</p>
<p>我們件的地方是大北旅社，是省政府交際處給介紹的，聽說這旅社以前是專住友邦人的，東家就是有名的松田公館的主人。而今，松田公館的大門嚴閉着，鈎上了一把鐵鎖。昔日担負領事責任而爲百靈廟經常運送軍需品的松田先生，已悄然隱沒了。作爲特務機關的羽山公館，主人還留在綏遠，但他的汽車已不再在街頭橫冲直撞，像過去軋碎了路旁的小生命，竟同隨意踏踐了一隻螞蟻一樣，揚長拂袖而去。目前全歸綏城，只有六位友邦人，不過他們全都很有禮貌，已失去了以前在綏遠飯店醉後放槍開玩笑那種豪興了。</p>
<p>今天我們派了三個同學，隨中央攝影　到百靈廟前錢去調查。關於那方面，我們將有詳細記載報告給欣慶着這次偉大勝利的全國同胞之前。</p>
<p>上午我們留在歸綏的四人，由軍民聯合會喬委員領着到三十五軍兩處醫院慰勞傷兵。一處是小東街，那兒大部分是在紅格爾圖受傷，共有五十八位，他們情緒都很好，輕傷的只說好了就冉到前錢去，另一處是上柵子街第四小學，算是初級野戰醫院，住傷兵三十三人，全是參加攻百靈廟的戰士。這里我們跟一位少校醫官允君談了許多話，他答允我們在百靈廟歸來後。苒來和受傷的弟兄個別談話。</p>
<p>在歸綏現有傷兵百二十餘人，還有一些住在公醫院。這個野戰醫院，上月十一日才組織成立對於傷兵的飲食起居，很爲不錯，他們每天吃一斤四兩洋麪，四兩小米，一毛錢菜，每頓都食肉，病室有火爐。很和暖，彼褥都很整潔。</p>
<p>這次抗戰，士氣非常旺盛，輕傷的全拒絕上担架床，不肯下來。他們認爲一息尙存，决不願失掉殺敵的機會，這勃發的熱忱，曾使長官們受到極大的感動，都說這是三十五軍作戰以來未曾有過的情狀；自然，拿民族戰爭來跟內戰相比，那是不能比的。那决內戰又有這樣使國入興奮，而給予熱烈的物質與精神的援助呢？</p>
<p>由於這次忠勇的抗戰，使我們對於中華民族復興的前途，更有着堅定的信念了。（孟覺寄自歸綏，十二月一日）</p>

<h3 id="c89">治愈肺病之重要關鍵 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>一要有忍耐與勇氣療養！　二要用藥適當不可亂投！</p>
<p>肺病為頑固難治之惡疾。非一朝一夕之療養。即可痊癒。須長期脫離社會。專心療養。方可竟達全功。故欲戰勝肺病。將其治愈。患者必須有大無畏之精神。養成長期間之勇氣及忍耐力。此實為治癒肺病之重要的關鍵。而世之死於肺病者。大都非死於病之本身。乃由於長期間自尋無謂之煩惱。心身困態。因之憤死者。</p>
<p>肺病須長期間治療。故每不免思及活動社會。思及健康之世人。而咒詛世界。艷羨他人。以為世人皆健康。而自獨染肺病。心復不平。此雖為患者所常有之不平不滿現象。而此不平不滿之煩惱。確能妨害精神之安靜。而促成強度之神經衰弱則夜不能安眠。食慾減退。續發各種障礙。不但使病不易早愈。而且不免病勢增惡。故治療肺病婆婆第一步。即應達觀一切。超越環境。修養精神。最為當務之急。</p>
<p>患者如有百折不撓之忍耐及沈勇之毅力。從事修養。同時再圖增進其體內生理上的防禦作用（即抵抗力）。而發春自然治癒之機能。由此而病變部之進行性者得變為停止性。熱度減退。痰咳減少。自然元氣旺盛。精神爽快。對於治癒。可有無窮希望。</p>
<p>世之患肺癆者每惶咳憂懼。惴惴然如末日之將至。實則於適當之時期。謀積極之治療。全治可期。惜乎病者多昧於醫藥常識。初時或忽焉不察。放任不治。或用藥不當。誤入歧途。卒至不治。堪為太息。就今日之醫藥進步狀況言。肺病已有物效之療法可施。近據各國肺病療養院所稱。德國新出之「肺活」Phith　Wael一藥。用以治療一二三各期肺癆（肺結核）確有著效。倘患者按法服用。同時並注意衛生。忍耐堅定。作長期之療養。而獲痊癒。重登健康者，竟能達至百分之九十五人云。是以忠告肺病同胞。切勿驚惶煩惱。自趨絕路。宜努力於此適當之治療。重享健康幸福。確不為難也。</p>
<h3 id="c90">值得我們注意的哮喘病根治的實驗報告 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Dr.G,Courtenary　M.D.作方視同醫師譯</p>
<p>德國新發明『哮立平』在臨床上試用之效果</p>
<p>氣喘之療法。從前因無完美之藥物。故世人皆認為難得根治之症。即吾單臨床醫家。對於本病。亦感棘手。衹於發作時。藉麻醉劑（嗎啡鴉片）暫時綏解其痛苦而已。欲其痊癒不發。總屬困難無望。惜此等麻醉劑不宜常用。恐有中素之處耳。市聞販賣之氣喘藥。其成分中因含有麻醉劑。雖能立刻生效。但若每發必用。則往往有成癮之弊。病家如購服此類含有毒質之氣喘藥。非但不能根治。且往往能貽中毒之巨害。可不慎之哉。</p>
<p>茲有Dr.Humbert　M.D.享皮耳脫博士根據多年經騐與最新學理。發明一氣喘根治藥。名『哮立平』Hollpin係一種內服片劑。藥內不含絲毫素質。雖功效偉大。但無任何副作用。專治老幼各種氣喘。呼吸困難等症。曾經萬國醫師推獎採用。余近年來治療氣喘一症。不下百餘例。均投以『哮立平』Holipin而能獲到根本治療者。竟達有百分之九十五人。</p>
<p>又意大利WIETELMNNE　SANATORIUM（威赫明療養院）哮喘病專家白克耳博士報告。自一九三五年七月至一九三六年四月間。診告哮喘病患者一五九人。內有八十一人已患病十餘年。且頻時發作。症狀較其他諸人為劇者。在以前曾施行注射或服藥各種療法。未得斷根。自本院施行內分泌療法之『哮立平』Hoipin內服後。經過四個月期間。在此八十一人重病內。有七十六人完全根治。至今並未接得有復發之報告者。可見是確實痊癒矣。其他五人因心臟病劇烈。以致不救。然則此八十一人以外之病家。均為發病不久之患者。（所謂輕病）。皆服用『哮立平』Holipin僅二三月期間。即全治斷根。尚有多數病家適當發病之時來治。即與以『哮立平』內服後。衹待十數分鍾。遂見哮喘平復。苦悶。氣急立解。發後持續內服此藥經過相當時期。無不治癒斷根。至於本劑之性質和善無毒。病家自己治療。不論老幼。服之均宜。毫無流弊。此更為各國醫師所推獎也。</p>

<p>— 陳和貞女醫士</p>
<p>保持月經的康健——是家庭和樂的源泉！</p>
<p>女子的健美　任何人皆知的朕兆是月經。月經若照常的來潮。按期的反復時。大概其性的機能。不呈何種異常狀態。同時可知其杝無什麼變化。當然是健美活潑</p>
<p>月經正常。就是表示女子身體的健全。若是月經不順。這就是表示女子身體的病弱。所以月經為女子身體健否的測定表。我每見青年的婦女。顏色蒼白。精神愛鬱。身體衰弱。一經診察和探詢的結果，十有九人。都是月經發生了異常的緣故。</p>
<p>月經不調所發的病狀。大概是月經前後的苦痛。月經不是過多。就是過少。經期不一定。或一月數次。或數月一次。下腹和腰部常時感覺脹痛。血氣虧損。並發神經衰弱的各種病象。如頭痛。不眠。肩酸。心跳。飲食不振。嘔氣。便秘、小便過多。頭暈。疲勞。麻痺。浮腫。全身倦怠。發生冷淡及不感症。這些病症的容態。由患者自身的陳述。可以知道實是不少數。</p>
<p>青年婦女罹患月經病的悲慘狀態。真是苦不堪言。破壞夫婦的美夢。引起家庭的不和。因為精神的苦悶。將青春健美的幸福。完全銷蝕在這個月經痛苦之中。是何等可惜。那末。月經的障礙。須及早施以適當療法。且要注意攝生。切不可輕視忽略的。</p>
<p>家庭治療月經不調的藥劑。在臨床上確有效果者。首推『美奴寗』M,norrin此劑對於婦人科的疾病月經不調！赤白帶下。歇司的里（即女性之神經衰弱）等症。服用『美奴寗』M,norrin能促進女子性器之發育。調整月經。使性感滿足。且能亢進新陳代謝。去瘀生新。補血強身。可預防婦人之老衰現象。久婚不孕者。用以調經種子。無不靈騐。曾經多數醫師之確實證明。認為婦女保健之源泉。</p>
<p>青年注意</p>
<h3 id="c92">撲滅神經衰弱症— <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— DR.HYDON　作陸方先醫學博士譯</p>
<p>是你事業走進大成就的先決問題！</p>
<p>我們應該以一個精神強健壯完全的人去從事於工作。則工作對於我們是趣味而非痛苦。而我們對於工作是主動而非被動。否則我們所做的一切。將都要帶著弱的記號。而在弱的中間。成功是不可能的。一個活力低微精神衰弱心理動搖步驟不定的人。自然永遠不會成就出什麼了不得的事業來。隨處我們可以看見許多青年。為了身心的萎弱。都嚷著志愿未酬的悲哀！而虛度其庸碌的一生！</p>
<p>一般青年衰弱的原因。很為複雜。大抵先天性的衰弱。是神經質和腺病質（即所謂先天不足）的人們居多。後天性的衰弱。例如患消耗病（肺結核。）惡液不衛生等所致者。除去上面各種上原因以外。還有手淫或房事過度。實為促成青年衰弱的一個最普遍而最大的原因！</p>
<p>我們的精神與全體的活力。都是由腦筋而產生出來的。所以學者說。腦筋為人身的主宰。就是因為腦頭是神經系統的根源地。若身體虛弱者，那麼全體的神經組織。自然地表現著衰萎的狀態。如頭腦昏沉。神志恍惚。頭痛。失眠。多夢。遺精。心跳。耳鳴。目光。思想遲鈍。記憶減退。懶惰作業。消化障礙。背脊痠痛皮膚蒼白。形容憔悴，這都是神經衰弱的現象。還有同時發生性機能障礙的—夢遺。滑精等。不但使青年時代的樂趣消滅殆盡。而且於婚姻和家庭的幸福上也有很大的影響—如果你要想在生命中有大成就的志願，必須要培養著卓越之精力—而奮力除去在黑暗中毀滅你生命力的『神經衰弱』—欲救治衰弱。培養壯健的精力。就應該規守一般攝生的條件。</p>
<p>常服『米美爾補腦汗』MEMORY　NEUROTIC用來滋養你全身已經枯萎的神經細胞。增加你的生命之源泉的血液。使你得著新的活力。彷彿從你的毛也中都能射出力量似的。因此。固然可以消滅了各種疾病。保持著最高度的身心之健康！而使你們在事業上有更良好更迅速的進展！</p>
<h3 id="c93">已婚男女　應注意子嗣有無的問題！ <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 黃耶魯醫師</p>
<p>生育為天賦之本能。子嗣為當然之結果。乃者久婚不育之現象。竟成為已婚男女唯一之大問題。若不加以解決。豈僅有關夫婦家庭間不幸福。抑對於社會國家之前途。亦關係綦重也。</p>
<p>子嗣之泉源。在於生殖機能。此人人所知也。如生殖機能衰頹或內分泌素缺乏者。則夫婦之間。性病隱患蜂起。在男子常罹遺精。腎虧。精力減退等症。在女子每患月經不調，白帶纏綿，乳房萎縮，宮冷腹痛等症。如其一方有病。子嗣即歸無望。病源既在生殖器機能不健全—既內分泌之減少。則根本治療自以補給內分泌—旺盛其生殖器機能—使之恢復於健全為主。</p>
<p>依據各國性病專家之實騐。男性之遺精夢洩。以服用「福郎固精片」Fonan　Tab為最有效。至於補腎強精問題。須同時注重。方能根本解決。此種補腎強精劑。只唯睪丸腺內分泌製品「還爾童」Well　Tonic有天然靈敏之滋陰補虛—培本壯元的偉大功效。</p>
<p>女性宜服用「美奴寗」Menorrin一藥。核武器可調經活血，滋補經血，強健子宮，促進其生殖機能，旺盛其分分泌，能使女性機能健全，氣血旺盛。青春健美。更加活潑可愛。</p>
<p>男女雙方倘能依照前法施行。無不一索得男。而度著美滿的夫婦生活。不致發生愛情的裂痕。</p>

<p>基於上言、意國政策、旣在近東、不在遠東、則中日間之事、當亦不欲干預、謂意日間此次協定、意國竟將正式承認偽滿、余恐未必、據余所知、意國設置駐瀋陽領館、乃臨時性質、暫以一年爲期、意國現方與英國拉攏、英國在遠東所不願爲之事、意國若經考量、自亦所不願、况意國正圖擴展在華市塲、何致因此有傷我國感情、抑允進者、意日兩國關係、過去並不甚佳，日本前頗覬覦阿比西尼亞、曾擬遣嫁一伯爵之女矛阿王子、爲意國所嫉、出而阻止、致好事未成、</p>
<p>日本所獲得不償失</p>
<p>繼談日本承認意併阿、無非爲恢復對阿商務、緣日本自歐戰以來、每年輸阿商品、輙在數千萬、現阿爲意佔領、日本自不甘放棄在阿市塲、故惟有承認意併阿、以求得意國承認其在阿　有權益、此點、意國此次誠有相當讓步、予以認可、惟吾人爲日本估價、殊屬得不償失、日本向以有色人種之老大哥自居、今而承認意併阿、不啻自批其頰、日本曩欲發展其勢力入印度、數决向甘地·太戈爾·運動、均遭沒趣、近年又見接於菲律濱、承認意併阿結果、將更爲東方有色人種所不齒、自絕門路、</p>
<p>日本國內輿論不滿</p>
<p>德日協定成立、日本官塲、初頗得意、以爲外交勝利、但輿論界並不謂然、余此次歸國、途經日本、見其國內報紙、對此固甚冷淡、未有好評、日本嘗謂、不欲過問歐州之事、今盟德聯意、豈非自投歐州漩渦乎、此爲其民間所反對也、余在德國時、曾聞諸德人言、德國與日本同盟、不過敷衍而已、又日本積極對華、純出軍人主張、財閥民間、均所不滿、有一事爲證、南滿鐵道公司、自松岡出任總裁後、每張股票卽跌價二元、前决資本家擬欲投資、軍人阻止、今則軍人號召投資、而資本家不願、如近倡投資華北、多裏足不前、蓋資本家恐軍入一朝異動、前功難免盡棄也云云、</p>

<p>（三）緯成利記絹絲公司成立　該公司製造廠設嘉興東門外，其前身為杭州緯成公司裕嘉分廠，全廠佔地六十餘畝，內分絹絲，繅絲，制繭三部，全部建築及機械設備需費達　百萬元。民二十該廠與杭總公司同時倒閉，浙江省財政廳以該公司前曾將全部不動產及機器作抵，由該廳擔保發行公司債券，該公司既已倒閉，自不能照章履行債務，故由該廳將所有抵押品執行，並將杭嘉二廠分別出租，裕嘉分廠絹絲部則由緯成慶記承租，嗣復由財政廳商得公司持券人及優先債權人之同意，將裕嘉分廠全部不動產及機器等照估定價格招標變資，當經三次減價標賣，終由上海利記公司以七十六萬七千四百三十七元之最低價標得，另以五萬七千元之代價受買該廠全部商標專用權，定名為緯成利記絹絲股份有限公司，專營絹絲之部，其餘繅絲，制繭兩部，聞仍擬出租，於本月二十日在滬召開創立會，設總公司於本埠長沙路一四九弄十六號，該公司係鄭贊臣，鮑孟威，朱禮耕等發起，實力雄厚，　絹絲本輕利厚，復為新興事業，故營業殊有把握云。</p>
<p>（四）經綸綢廠出盤　該廠設立於民國十九年，係周保良君獨資創辦，周君夫婦前均為物華綢廠工人，平日節衣縮食，故能略得積蓄，乃購織機二部，全部資產約費五六百元，夫婦刻苦經營，營業日臻發達，後漸加擴充，共置電機九架，雇用工人十八人，及學徒三四人，專代莊客織造，生涯尚稱穩健，惟去年春季以來，綢業因市面不佳，相繼貶價傾銷，該廠頗受打擊入秋以後，絲價突然飛漲，該廠資金短絀，無力墊欵代織，且絲價雖逐步上騰，而綢價則增價困難，具市場購買力驟然減退，處境非常困難，終至負債纍纍，無力維持，乃由債權人將該廠所有廠基生財機器等以六百元出盤與元豐泰記綢廠營業云。</p>
<p>（五）大生機器廠清理召盤　該廠創立於民國十四年間，由徐慶雲君獨資經營，資本無定額，雇用工人十七八人，專造織綢機及打水機，初時營業頗盛，尤以織綢機為甚，惟一二八以還，各綢廠營業衰落，織綢機之需求亦隨之減退，二十三年以後，營業更見清淡，該廠乃改造大小連　式打水機，蓋彼時各地適旱荒成災，此機之需要，相當迫切，故能賴此支持，勉度開支，然旱災過去，該機供過於求，營業復重陷苦境，延至本月七日，卒告清理召盤云。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c134">淋毒如燎原之火不容頃刻忽視：　如何救治淋病之變症慘烈！！ <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>本刊對於淋病之醫學衛生常識，已迭有介紹；稱頌一時！茲特再將淋症之病理變化，表面出之，以為患者之借鑒，而知所以防範與處置，庶幾可免於焦頭爛額，臨渴而掘井也。</p>
<p>夫淋病之不易治，已不待言；然窮流溯源，則淋菌繁殖迅速，進行猛厲，實其最大主因。蓋人體陰莖之組織，為一富於血管性之海綿體，一經傳染淋菌，則菌毒即附著於尿道壁而潛留於粘膜之上，故舊日盛行透膜殺菌療法，即通過粘膜而殺除淋菌是也，但此法不久即宣告失敗。此則因為淋菌在感染初起，始附著於尿道壁粘膜，然經過一二日後，淋菌即由粘膜深進而入海緜體中，由該部血管之吸收，流竄入於血液內。從此淋菌繁生不已，其變症之慘烈，亦難僕數。其在局部者，則睪丸腫硬攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，及女子受丈夫淋毒傳染而患白帶，子宮炎爛。夫婦一方有慢性淋病而不治癒者，則終身絕嗣滅育，甚且因攝護腺炎而發生遺精帶血症，引起生命危險。</p>
<p>至於淋毒之全身癥狀，如令人殘廢之關節炎，心臟瓣膜炎等，皆為最慘列之險症！</p>
<p>然則淋病將何以應付之？歐美學者於近年來極度研索之下，乃發見一確切之特異療法。其初步手續則採取淋菌注射於牛馬家兔之體內，一星期內該動物血中即產生一種異乎尋常之感應蛋白體，此蛋白體有昂盛血球撲滅淋菌及提增抗淋抗毒之作用。然後抽出是項蛋白體，施於淋病患者之身，其驅除淋菌之特種效果業經Shmide以及Rudolf等氏證實。並且更進一步由畢德博士將此蛋白體，配用功能消炎鎮痛之純粹黃色素，合製而為淋病內服聖藥「克淋儂」。服後能因藥內所含之蛋白體昂進患者體中抗淋素及白血球數量，使淋菌淋毒，一鼓殲滅無餘！凡男女淋病白帶及睪丸炎膀胱炎攝護腺炎關節炎等，服之皆可徹底斷根，照常生育！若能兼外用「抗淋水」依說明書用法。在家自己洗滌尿道，則不必登醫師之門內外兼施，收效極速極準！</p>
<p>（按：「克淋儂」為最首創之合製劑，凡不含蛋白體之合製淋藥，概係混充雜牌偽劑！）</p>
<h3 id="c135">失戀者的自省　求戀愛的本錢 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>……愛情的維繫不在金錢勢力而在體格的雄偉，　……有雄偉的體格才能獲到愛情的永久的勝利！</p>
<p>時常聽人說，戀愛是神聖的，純潔的，並不帶著金錢和勢力的條件，這話也許是對的。可是你如果體格不健全，帶著暗疾去和異性周旋，那他們終極的結果，一定會失敗的。而異性的愛，自然會轉移到體格健全者的身上。因為我們兩性的愛情的焦點在性慾，一個對性慾有缺點，對身體不發育的男性，萬難蹈進戀愛的圈內。這不但我們人類如此，就是動物求愛也是如此。我們時常看到一羣雄性的動物逐求雌性動物，結果雌性動物接受其中最雄壯動物的愛，而把不壯健的動物撇下，甚或把牠可取死。這多麼殘的戀愛啊！那麼戀愛的本錢是性組織的健全，大概不會怎樣錯的。</p>
<p>原來我們在十五六歲左右發育時期，多因本身荷爾蒙所刺戟，及外界之引誘，結果只有出於手淫一途以發洩之。豈知一旦成為習慣，性器官因得不得內泌之供給，故發育不全，局部短小，遺精早洩，勃起力不能，不能人事，精神十分委弱，貧血皮膚乾燥，兩鬢早白，呈未老先衰之象，這種男性，不但配不上談戀愛，即已結婚者也難免離拆之兆，但以現在科學進步，欲行挽救，當非難事。Fennpson博士，常以德國「補體康」一藥，在性病醫院中實地治騐不以育之男子，計三千五百餘人之眾。因「補體康」係荷爾蒙製劑，能強壯性組織，而促下部之發育，並用「耐而斯遺精片」治其遺精早洩等。在五六星期中即可治癒，肌肉充實，營餐佳良，髪白轉黑，並能使面貌豐腴，風儀動人。則愛情盡可永遠地維繫，故「補體康」為一般青年失戀的救星。</p>
<h3 id="c136">久困病床之肺癆症患者所渴望的自療法已實現 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>我國由於科學不進步，一般民眾醫藥智識的缺乏，低級社會的人害了肺癆，則委之前世冤孽，求神問卜，至於頭腦新一點的，卻誤信以前所流傳的說法，認為肺病沒有特效藥，而迷信醫師的治療。</p>
<p>我不是說肺病人不需要醫師，但醫師對於肺病人實在用處很少。只要住過肺療養院的人，就知道醫師對於他們僅是顧問式的，而不是臨床式的；因為肺病實在全靠療養！</p>
<p>即如最近已取得世界地位的「虛脫療法」，其應用卻只限於外科的治療。如人工氣胸術，開肋骨，割神經等肺科外治法，雖然有確切的功效，但並非每個肺病人所能施用，所以它的應用範圍仍是不廣！</p>
<p>根據此點，「虛脫療法」早有許多學者想把它運用於內服藥物療法上，歷經無數次的實騐，終於發明告成！這就是今天肺癆病所以盛行內服「補肺拿爾」一藥的主因。</p>
<p>「補肺拿爾」的學理是根據於肺髒外科的「虛脫療法」的，故服此與人工氣胸等有異曲同工之妙。本劑能減退患側肺之血行和淋巴行，並減少病灶組織之酸素供給，使癆菌失去活動力而漸次消滅。故服後潮熱退除，咯血停止，咳嗽和咯痰均見稀鬆，盜汗胃等，逐步消滅。因此本劑現已普遍風行各國！如兼與「補體康」一藥同服，則更能治癒因肺癆而引起之神經衰弱，失眠遺精等症了！</p>

<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業　武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>女子最難處理的就是月經病。因為月經是女性一生康健及幸福的支配者。假使一個女子月經按期而至，來時並無腹痛腰酸頭痛等，此為生理的月經。其卵巢機能，亦必健全。故受孕力甚旺也，然有許多女子，因結婚過早，房事太繁，至子宮與卵巢皆失去健全的常態。於是百病叢生。最顯明的有經來少腹脹痛，或如針刺，經色黯淡，或凝結成塊。障礙血液的循環，紅血球減少，故有面色萎黃，呈貧血之狀態。而受姙力更遭重大打擊。故神經亦陷衰弱，如頭重眼昏，心中苦悶，失眠健忘，有憂鬱症。凡此皆為月經病經病之根源，而乳房癟小，發育不全者，也與月經病有關。「補女容」一藥，為調整月經病最有效之處置，因其有調整月經，刺戟卵泡，強壯神經，故月經病既獲根除，神經衰弱亦去。一切由月經不調而來之疾患皆可治癒。是「補女容」一藥洵女子月經病之有效對策也。有白帶者，可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，經滌除白帶。此為我從南通醫科大學畢業後所經騐的事實。</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>患者申雪卿君，年廿四歲，在廿一歲時，即染淋病，雖迭加醫治，但依然未得斷根，隨發隨治，而毒氛內熾，傳入深部，小腹與會陰肛門鈍痛。其會部分，有索狀物突起。房事射精時，作劇烈之　痛，小便時淋絮相雜。申君因誤信透膜殺菌之成藥，服後反將病的範圍放大。睪丸亦覺脹痛，惟不甚劇。嗣因舊病客戴叔雍君之介紹，至餘外醫治，將其逸出精液用五百倍顯微鏡檢查，見其精液中有許多淋菌。惟精虫則甚稀少，（如第一圖）蓋半為毒菌所殺害矣。再經仔細檢查，知申君之病，確已成為輸精管炎，而攝護腺及睪丸等鄰接器官，亦已並發炎症。除電療外，囑向永安公司購服「克淋儂」，以消炎殺菌鎮痛利尿。一方用「抗淋水」依說明書用法自己在家洗滌尿道。前後服用自療僅四星期餘，即獲根治，炎症盡去，尿液澄清。更用顯微鏡檢查精液，則淋菌絕跡。惟存精虫及純潔之精液（如第二圖）</p>
<h3 id="c139">（第一圖） <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>未服「克淋儂」前，淋菌在精液中頗為繁夥。其密集之處皆淋菌也而精虫反甚少。</p>
<h3 id="c140">（第二圖） <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>服「克淋儂」後，其精液中已不見淋菌蹤跡，所見者惟精液及精虫而已。</p>

<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>丈夫一朝染得淋毒，妻子終身受苦！</p>
<p>女性的病本來多於男子，但有許多病，實由男子傳給她的。例如女子的白帶病，本來已很普通地流行於婦女界，但更有許多性喜冶遊的丈夫，染得淋病，在房事時將精液和淋菌一齊射進入道與子宮，因而起子宮炎與　炎。其泌出之白帶，含有劇烈毒性，偶爾沾染眼中，即有失明的危險，所以患有淋毒性白帶的女子，初生兒往往有失明的事。原因就是在此。</p>
<p>我們要掃除白帶，當然無要除去淋病。其最效之治療，除內服「克淋儂」以除淋外，一方用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，把在局部的淋毒白帶滌盪無餘。因「卡而雪地陰道片」富有殺菌防腐止泌之效。為白帶特效藥，且可在家秘密自療。惟因月經病而來的白帶，則除用此片為坐藥外，同時宜服「補女容」以調經更妥。</p>

<p>尿道周圍炎病理的解剖與療法</p>
<p>尿道周圍炎者，多因淋毒在尿道浸淫，形成小結節，復由此等小結節化為膿瘍而來者。此等浸潤性疾患，一般多在尿道粘膜之深部，與尿道內側管。尤其因分歧複雜而發生者。通常初起有米粒大以至小豆大，僅漸漸形成硬化之小結節，但因屢次進行性之小炎症而呈侵潤之狀態，有呈膿瘍之傾向，更向外部皮膚，或固有尿道粘膜破壞，亦有同時向兩方面破壞，形成瘺管之危險者。不過據余多年來實地觀察，此症多由於膿瘍中淋菌，或者第二次感染之結果，與由其他細菌存在而來者。患如一旦化膿，或生瘺管，則有終身難愈，或者失去生死器健全之危險。但在未形成此種症狀時，則外用電療與「抗淋水」，內服蛋白體黃色素混合劑「克淋儂」則所患自能迅獲根治。</p>
<p>患者田稼軒君，前在某遊藝場與某女招待有染。致罹淋病。醫治尚未斷根，而又涉足花叢，致重感淋病，尿道腫痛，炎症熾張，小便艱　。呈痙　性之疼痛。乃行尿尿檢查鏡診察，尿道中果有不少小豆大之結節，發炎呈緋紅色。但幸未化膿。即施用長短電波交互治療後，同時內服德國彼得氏所發明之「克淋儂」，俾殺菌消炎，防腐鎮痛利尿，以保持不使尿道粘膜因炎症腐爛，同時外用「抗淋水」，俾殺菌消炎殺菌，將結節消滅。前後施用至五星期，尿道間之痛苦全失。再用尿道鏡檢查，則小豆之結節，確已確消滅無蹤。周圍粘膜亦復常態。此為尿道周圍炎根治之鐵證。亦為「克淋儂」與「抗淋水」二藥戰勝淋疾之偉大成績也。</p>

<p>手淫的癖好，自高等的民族一直通過到最野蠻的人，它已經成了積重難返的人類的特有惡習，為青年和性慾變態者惟一的慰籍了。</p>
<p>但誰知道這乃是對於人類種族和社會最有毒害的習慣，醫學家早已大聲疾呼的宣告於全人類了。此外房事過多，也是有害於身體的健康的。早婚或是嗜行手淫的青年，往往結果會罹有遺精夢精等症，終之防礙性的發育，而成性器矮小體格萎瘦的危局。他不能博取妻子的歡心！即使結婚了，也必然勃起力不壯，早洩，甚則陰萎，人道欠缺。據我在俄國莫京留學時，蘇聯為了提倡力的建設，醫學家都主用獅虎海狗的睪丸精青春腺等荷爾蒙製劑為產生壯健青年幹部的唯一聖品了。於是那含有獅虎海狗等荷爾蒙的「補體康」一藥，頓時風行起來，一直到現在，還是大量被人採服。據精密的統計，大都於服後即獲轉弱為強，發育強大，性力壯健，所有早洩陰萎，一掃而除！如遺精漏精之症，可同時兼服「耐而斯遺精片」，效騐準確異常！冬令若進服「補體康」，雖大寒不畏冷，並能免除凍瘡之憂咧！</p>

<p>上海大學體聯會足球錦標賽、昨日舉行第二次賽復旦因排演援綏話劇表演、及明白與進德作中華足球中字組錦標之爭、故對同濟之役改期、僅光華對暨南一塲、交鋒於眞如球塲、雙方實力匹敵、戰情因以緊張、雙方後防、均固若金湯、光華尤高一籌、陳志傑賣足氣力、救出不少險球、惟暨南因得地利之宜、攻勢較甚、但以脚頭欠硬、鏖戰多時、一無所獲、直至最後半分鐘、始中蔡今才於罰球綫外遙射、斜飛網角、卽以此最寳貴之一球、判决勝負、光華雖不幸失收、但已極盡厥職矣、現朁南已兩戰兩勝、不難保持其獨霸江大之雄風、但本屆惟一勁敵、卽爲復旦、下週兩隊將相逢於眞如、且看如何解决也、</p>

<h3 id="c148">滬江擊敗持志　結果爲四十八比四十六　同濟克南洋卅三比二七 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>西靑籃球大學組中、曾於開幕日戰勝復旦之持志隊、昨晚竟以二分之差、敗於　江、是戰爲大學組中最緊張之一慕、自始至終、不能斷定誰勝誰負、直至最後之一分鐘、因滬江中鋒朱培生之一球、遂判滬江以四十八比四十六勝、同濟之勝南洋、亦爲一興奮之局、黃蜂之抗麥令甲、無異以卵擊石、但上半時黃蜂頑强抗戰、僅負三分耳、昨日共賽六塲、結果如下、</p>
<p>隊之勝負　組別　上半時　總結果</p>
<p>同文勝稅專　初級　十一比八　二四比十四</p>
<p>沙谷雨勝勇敢　初級　廿一比十一　卅二比廿二</p>
<p>精武勝少年　初級　十五比十　廿七比廿四</p>
<p>滬江勝持志　大學　二九比二七　四八比四六</p>
<p>同濟勝南洋　大學　廿一比十一　卅三比二七</p>
<p>麥令甲勝黃蜂　獨立　十六比十三　四六比二十</p>
<p>滬江克持志</p>
<p>今年滬江實力、平康無奇、曾敗於同濟及復旦、持志確爲一支新興勁旅、　來有聲有色、曾戰勝名隊復且及南洋同濟等、故逆料滬江厥非其敵、且相差殊懸也、詛知滬江鞏固防綫、使持志不能暢所欲爲、竟造成相持不下、難解難紛之形勢、而持志則反形手忙脚亂、陣綫粉碎、比賽之進行、滬江一路領先、持志從未一頭角、局勢之興奮動人較信通與辛隊之戰、猶有過之、</p>
<p>滬江之勝、要而論之、爲後衛陸鍾愈之遠射成功、而獲得巨大分數、有以致之、渠有六次之射中紀錄、共得十三分、錢敬鏞亦得六球、罰中三次、得十五分、馮玉來之五球、更爲錦上添花矣、</p>
<p>持志方面、雖山梁蘊明獨得二十三分之最高紀錄、但中鋒陳學崇反、祗獲八分、而舒英海僅獲三分、此爲最大之損失、</p>
<p>上半時除成十八比十八及二十七比二十七兩决平手外、滬江常佔先一二分、但亦僅此一二分耳、因錢敬鏞之一射、成二十九比二十七、滬江勝兩分於上半時、</p>
<p>以後之形勢、一如前塲、極力扎掙、至最後三四分鐘、滬江會以四十六比四十一、勝前五分、梁蘊明陳學崇各中一球後、則又僅差一分、陸鍾愈得罰球而未中、忽被張良雄罰球造四十六比四十六之最後平手、斯時僅餘一分鐘之寳貴光陰、雙方陷於苦戰、使觀衆之情緒、與奮達於沸點、持志全力進攻、被朱培生溜之籃下、得一後方之遠球、從容托入最光榮之兩分、使持志就此屈服焉、四十八比四十六、使大學組中、無常勝軍矣、以後比賽之進行、益足耐人尋味、</p>

<p>同濟挫南洋</p>
<p>兩隊球均差、但實力平均、故戰來並頗見緊張、雙方均覺手脚生疏、陣容紊亂、殊少佳作、同濟端賴黎嗣林之運籌帷幄、攻守重任、一人兼具、勞苦高功、不愧功臣、最後三次遠射妙中、因之獲得最後勝利、而陶煉技術雖生、但若非此公之吉人天相、或須一度局勢、上半時南洋殊不得志、以三比十四落後、最後成二十一比十一、下半時南洋陣容一新、劉景峯調任中鋒、前鋒頗有幾决美妙傳遞、分數一躍局成二十比二十一、僅差同濟一分、頗有新興氣象、但黎嗣林施行遠射、果然成功、南洋亦不示弱、劉程各有建樹、又成二十四比二十五、最後同濟賴陶陳之獲分、終以三十三比二十七戰勝南洋、</p>

<p>麥令勝黃蜂</p>
<p>黃蜂因章文元之缺席、近攻力量减色、陶紹生頗有佳作、董小培運球太深入底綫、無回身餘地、失去機會不少、上半時相差達八分鐘、使麥令不開紀錄、而黃蜂得四次罰球、祇中一分、麥令陣容、殊爲慌亂、投範允多不準、樂克肉感豐富、已失去鋒芒、上半時十六比比十三之緊局面、在下半時不復再見、體力與技術、終因相差懸殊也、</p>
<p>正式紀錄員、錯誤百出、黃蜂陶紹生三次犯規、誤記四次、爭論甚久、裁判與紀錄、堅持不誤、經麥令之請求、仍准陶繼續作戰、而黃華庭共犯五决規、僅記三次、以此類推、紀錄殊不可靠、希望以後各隊須派幹揀之紀錄員、從旁糾正之、</p>
<p>是賽在上半時中、麥令以十二比七領前、七號之派洛斯、因救球不慎、自已誤中一球、引起哄堂大笑不已、</p>

<p>— 顧景羣</p>
<p>小朋友們！我想大家都見到，近日報上接連的登載着匪偽猖獗犯邊。而進擾綏遠，與駐軍開火的消息吧！我們見到之後，也會一度的猜想到其中的利害嗎？我們要知道，綏遠是我國國防第一道的防綫，綏遠的得失，實是我中華民國生死存亡的大關鍵，我們應當萬分的注意，而不可忽視的。我們更見到綏省的前方將士們，他們滿含着沸騰的熱血，在冰天雪地中奮勇抗戰，來捍衛國家的疆土，决不失寸土於敵，像這樣的精神是値得我們欽佩的</p>
<p>現在滬上各界熱烈地捐款，紛紛匯往綏遠去，以爲物質上的援助，來慰勞我們爲國家爲民族求生存的忠勇的戰士們！小朋友們！我們也是中華民國國民的一份子，我們也得盡一下國民的天職，從糖果，玩具，點心等，各種的費用上，節省下來，捐助給爲國效勞的綏遠將士們，雖然一個人節省下來的錢，是極有限的，然而我相信，把全國各地小朋友們所節省下來的錢，來計算一下，那麼一定有一筆鉅大的款項，足夠給綏遠的將士們，在物質上得到莫大的援助，所以希望全國的小朋友們！一致的起來實行，來貢獻給前敵的將士們</p>
<h3 id="c161">綏遠戰事擴大 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們知道嗎？綏遠戰事擴大了！我們東北的遼寗；吉林；黑龍江，熱河等四省，已經被敵人侵佔五年了！現在他們又來奪我們綏遠省了！綏遠在地勢上是很重要的。假使要是失掉了的話，那西北各省都要爲他人所有了，在這種的情况之下，請問小朋友們，我們應該怎樣辦呢？我想：諸位小朋友們的答詞，一定是「我們要保守我們的綏遠，我們來和他打！」不錯，大家都是這樣的意思。現在守綏遠的傅作義，已經和他們打了，他們打來好幾决，都被我們打退了，不過今天氣已經冷了，綏遠那邊，更比我們江南冷得厲害，那些打仗的將士，還沒有皮衣穿，而且吃的也都是些冷餅；冷窩窩頭；這似乎太對不住我們愛國的將士了。所以最近有好些人拿出錢來捐給他們買衣服；買糧食；上海方面，更發起小學生一枚運動，就是每天節省一枚銅元來，作慰勞綏遠將士的用項。抱有愛國心的小朋友們，自然是贊成這個辦法。可是我希望諸位小朋友，在一枚運動以外，每天再多節省幾個銅元，或者請求你們的父母，多捐一些，能够捐一塊錢力量的，就捐一塊錢：能够捐一角錢的，就捐一角錢。這樣，才足以表示你們是愛國的好兒童，才對得起前方效命的愛國將士。</p>

<p>— 錢中正</p>
<p>母親：</p>
<p>我勉强壓抑了無限的悲哀與熱情，來寫這對給你訣別的信。</p>
<p>現在我正在前綫的戰塲上，我別的念頭都沒有，在我的腦海中，只有爲國而犧牲的一念，連你都不敢想，如果想起了你的慈愛，你的偉大，恐怕要减少我殺敵的精神。雖然國殤的人兒，是很可惜的，但是究竟爲了正義，公道，而犧牲，也不虛一死。</p>
<p>你在訣別時對我所說的話，我都忘了，所記得的，只有：「願你死在戰塲上，不要死在家中，更不願在敵兵未退之前，來見我。」別的話我不能去記牠，所記得的話，是能使我奮發，勇敢前進，擊退敵人，預備來見你偉大慈祥的母親，能很親愛地受到你的吻和懷抱。我想要立刻受到你的吻和懷抱，所以不得不立刻打退這敵人</p>
<p>母親！我希望你做中國最偉大愛國的母親，並希望別人的母親，也同你一樣。母親！你不必悲傷，文天祥先生曾經說過：「人生自古誰無死，留取丹心照汗靑」！不過死遲早而已，你更不要以爲從此沒有看見你活潑可愛的兒子了。像林覺民先生所說：「生在今日的時勞，盜賊可以死，食官污吏虐待人民可以死，生在今日的中國，沒有一處不可以死，倒不如爲爭民族生存而戰死吧！</p>
<p>母親！你不要以爲沒有兒子而悲傷，我本來也不信鬼，但我現在眞希望死後有鬼，我希望這話可靠，那末你仍能見你活潑的兒子，不至於悲痛吧！</p>
<p>現在軍號已經吹了，我們就要進行，再會吧！慈愛的母親！最後我還得來喚呼一聲：「中華民國萬歲！中華民國萬禹歲！」</p>

<p>— 崇實小學六上毛申時</p>
<p>天氣一天寒冷一天了！尤其在綏遠，據報上說那邊已經下着很大的雪，結着很厚的冰了！可是我們想想：在此匪偽和敵人們進擾綏邊的時候，一般前綫抗敵的將士，在飢寒交迫下還能奮勇的抵抗，巳是很不容易了！何况在嚴冷的泳天雪地中，不知要受多少苦楚呢！</p>
<p>小朋友啊！同時我們又想想：我們一般被難在戰區裏的同胞，不論男的女的老的少的，他們因爲環境的不安，匪偽的騷擾，不得不扶老携幼逃來逃去的避免災難；離開了家鄉，忍着飢寒，在荒凉的田野裏徬徨，受苦。同時你又可以想像到和你同樣大小的千百個無辜的小朋友，在那戰區裏挨餓，受寒。小朋友啊！我們難道忍心讓這些親愛的同胞被難嗎？凍斃嗎？一定不願意的吧！</p>
<p>爲了要援救我們一般作戰的勇士和無辜被難的同胞，我就發起一個募衣的援綏運動；請各位先去問問自家媽媽有沒有廢置的，或陳舊的，甚至多餘的棉衣棉褲，把它捐集起來；進一步糾合了三五個小同志，設法向各方面去儘量的徵募，不論男女老少的衣帽鞋襪，都可送到綏遠去。我以爲我們的力量雖小但多少和戰士們，難胞們有點補益吧！親愛的小朋友們，大家快些起來完成這個援綏的募衣運動吧！</p>

<p>— 際</p>
<p>際此綏遠被匪偽和敵人進擾聲中，我以爲小朋友們對於綏遠至少要有下列各項的認識　綏遠合熱河，察哈爾稱內蒙古，民國三年劃爲特別區域，十七年九月，改建行省；轄十七縣，兩設治局，二盟（十三旗五及一總管，省府爲歸綏，</p>
<p>綏遠全境面積計三〇四，〇五八平方公里。人日總數計一，八〇五，七九九人。</p>
<p>綏遠的物產：動物以半，馬，羊，騾，駱駝，爲最多，皮革毛絨爲大宗輸出品。植物以糧食，木材，藥材的出產最豐。確物以媒鐵最豐，銀，鋁，石油，食鹽，曹達决之。手工業品以絨毛皮革製品及氈毯爲最著。</p>
<p>綏遠交通：鐵路有平綏路的豐歸段及綏包段。二段共長七百三十九華里餘。公路已成的有六百零二公里。電政凡：有綫電報，無綫電報，長途電話等均備。郵政局有六十餘所。航空在歸綏，包頭設有飛機塲。</p>
<p>俗語說：「天下黃河，惟富一套」。黃河的後套。便全在綏遠境內。這些地帶。土地肥沃，原野廣闊，最宜開墾。</p>
<p>小朋友呀！敵人們覬覦這些富源久了，如果我們再不起來捍衛疆土，保守富源，將不堪設想了！</p>

<p>小朋友　這綏遠的『綏』是安定，『遠』是遠近的遠，聯合起來解釋便安安定定遠在那邊的意思，可是咱們正是因久以爲它安定遠在一邊，相安無事，不去注意它，所以有賊來窺視是意中事了，但是那些賊不凑巧，碰了釘子，却碰到了咱們的師『傅』他是個有『作』有爲當仁不讓，見『義』勇爲的主席，所以當賊來進窺時，决予以迎頭痛擊，也是意中事了。</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>喂！全國親愛的小朋友呀！你們可聽見隆隆的大砲聲嗎？砰砰，拍！拍！……的槍聲嗎？在這幾天以來，匪偽靠着某方的勢力，正用飛機，大砲，坦克車來進擾我國防最前錢的綏遠，幸有忠勇的傅作義將軍，領着他手下的健兒，在連天冰雪中殺敵，這是何等可喜可敬呵！天天報紙上載着警惕的字句，喚醒一般醉生夢死的民衆，我們小朋友總該曉得，現在北方門戶的綏遠，是多麼的危險呀！雖在千里以外的南方，也應該同聽到槍砲聲一樣的驚懼！</p>
<p>小朋友呀！我們站在綏東綏北前綫的抗敵將士，抱着不屈不撓，百折不回的大無畏精神，和敵人拼個你死我活，所以現在匪偽軍不能侵入綏境寸土，我們怎能不重重的去慰勞他們呢？時當冬令，那邊天氣奇寒，我忠勇的將士們！受盡飢寒的苦楚，我們溫暖飽食的南邊人士，試問誰能安心？我們難道坐視綏遠的同胞，受人家的宰割嗎？我們不要以為遠在幾千里以外的綏遠，得失沒有多大關係，和我更無干，要曉得綏遠旣稱爲國防最前綫，他的重要自可想見，如果一旦失守，我敢說北方就完了，整個的國防中心，整個的國家屏障，也就無法挽回，恐怕不久的將來，我們大禍就要臨頭，整個的國家也就犧牲了</p>
<p>小朋友呀！綏遠的得失，就與整個國家興亡有密切的關係，也就是我們存亡生死，最後掙扎的時候了！所以我抱着十二分的誠意，向全國親愛的小弟弟，小妹妹們！大聲疾呼：「我們趕快起來組織援綏募捐隊呀！」我想；你們諸位一定接受我的請命吧！希望我們四萬萬同胞，各自量力，捐欵到前方，去慰問我忠勇殺敵的將士，使他們不受飢寒，予以物質上；精神上的援助，得以安心抗敵，那麼，綏遠不會失守，整個的國家屏障，就不致動搖了。好！好！我們趕快起來組織募捐隊，出發到附近的各鄉；各鎭；各縣去寡集鉅欵，匯到申報館，作爲綏遠前方軍士慰勞金，小朋友呀！我們率二萬萬的小同胞！快快組織援綏的寡捐隊呀！</p>

<p>小朋友們，這一遭『匪偽進犯綏遠』的消息，想來大家一定也早在報上瞧到過了，要不是傅作義主席的『誓死』抗戰，捍衛國士，恐怕不堪設想吧！</p>
<p>不過，抗敵非徒託空言，一定要有充分的『力量』，源源的接濟，才能够持久，</p>
<p>記得上决『九一八』馬占山將軍抗敵之役，你們的確節省了不少糖果錢，去捐給東北義勇軍做軍餉，至今人家還常要提及這同事，稱贊着你們的好處，爲今之計，不用說，還是『再來一下子』，照舊把糖果錢節省下來，捐給『前錢抗敵將士』，比較得輕而易舉；好在糖果畢竟是閒食，儘可以少喫的，一個人捐一角，百人就成十元，萬人就成千元，那數目着實也不小呢！</p>

<p>末後却想出一個辦法來了。那些車夫中有一人開口說道：「讓我們把自已的皮外套輪流借給伊，或者就讓伊一逕穿下去，而我們每趕一里彼此替換好了，」他提議之後，大家都贊同了。當下就有一個車夫脫下他的羊皮外套來，給柏絲可菲好好的穿在身上，而他自已却裏着那張貨物的包布，將他一雙脚蜷在下面，更提高了聲音唱着歌曲。每見一塊紀錄里數的碑石，他們總得把羊皮外套脫下一决，而在換穿的時候，總得有一番愉快的談笑。一路上柏絲可菲在默默的祈禱，願他們不要因此而損害他們的健康。</p>
<p>他們旣到了依加什林寗堡的旅店中，店中女主人將鎭中幾位慈善家告知了伊，而尤其贊美一位密林夫人，說伊是樂善好施，人人都知道的。伊就喚柏絲可菲明天去看這位夫人，商量怎樣前進的辦法。司是道一天恰好是禮拜日，柏絲可菲卽忙上禮拜堂去。伊那祈禱的虔誠和身上那身破碎的旅行衣，很引起了人家的注意，當伊走出禮拜堂時，就有一位太太來向伊的姓名。柏絲可菲把姓名說了，便請伊指點密林夫人所住的地方，並說道位夫人的慈善是人所共知的。那位太太却對伊說道：「我怕這位密林夫人的慈善，未免說得太過分了些；你不妨跟着我來，讓我來照顧你好了。」</p>
<p>柏絲可菲不很喜歡聽這種破壞密林夫人的話，於是那太太忙將密林夫人的住處指給伊瞧，更囑咐伊說，要是此去被失人拒絕，那麼儘可到伊那裏去。柏絲可菲並不回答，走到密林夫人門前，向下人們　夫人在家不在家。下人們都很詫異的望着他們的女主人，原來那位伊和講話的太太正是密林夫人自已。</p>
<p>這一位慈善夫人把伊留在家裏，當伊客人看待，足足的過了一冬，盡力醫可伊那夜在大風雪中所受的凍傷，同時伊將普通的敎育敎導柏絲可菲。柏絲可菲自從伊父親被放逐到西伯利亞以後，差不多將寫讀這冋事，全都忘壞了，到此便重行讀畫和寫字起來。伊每决說起了密林夫人的慈善，總不由得要流下感激的眼淚來。但伊一面亦舒舒服服的過活，一面想到了伊的父母正在冰天雪地中挨苦，中覺得加倍的難受。然而密林夫人不肯放伊難開依加什林寗堡，直到第二年的春天夫人才給伊在加麥河上一艘平底大船中買了一個座位，托船上的人好生照顧着伊，此人是載着一船的鐵和鹽前往尼布諾夫高洛去的。</p>
<p>那知不幸得很，此人忽然病倒了，不得不留下在加麥河邊的一個小村子裏，於是柏絲可菲依舊沒人看顧，單身的出發了。</p>

<h3 id="c173">德意日結成了集團以後 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 中和</p>
<p>最近國際間有兩個驚動全世界的問題，卽是德日和意日協定的先後成立。這兩個恊定的成立不僅表現了西方的侵略者與日本的關係更加密切，而且顯示了德意日道三個國家已結成了集團。雖然現在意犬利還未參加德日協定，德國與意日協定也沒有直接關係，意德日三國更還未曾公然簽訂攻守同盟的條約，但就這三個國家的國情及其對外政策來說，就它們最近成立的那兩個協定的性質來說，它們在某些點上却是站在一條戰綫上的。這個集團的戰綫之結成，當然不是爲的什麼「自衛」，因爲德意日三國都是所謂强大之國，它們的國土絕沒有被人掠奪，內政也沒有受人干涉，所謂「自衛」問題實沒有提出的根據；至於共同防禦什麼生義的發展，那更是國內的思想問題，根本用不着成立什麼協定來應付。如果我們不爲那些國際間的外交文章所蒙惑，那我們便可指出德日和意日成立協定之實際用意，是在相互承認「旣成事實」，共同保衛彼此　奪得的土地，一致努力侵略弱小民族，同世界和平進攻。我們看，德日協定的第　條不是已暗示出了要壓迫受着什麼勢力威脅的國家投降它們嗎？附屬議定書的第三條不是規定它們要設立常務委員會來對付一切嗎？這些是什麼意義呢？凡是愛好和平，尊重自己國家的主權者都完全知道的。若說因意日協定的成立，日本由此承認意大利併呑阿比西尼亞，那意義便更加明顯了；誰也不能說　是爲了什麼「自衛」與「和平」。</p>
<p>日本近來在遠東的一切行動，已經够使人驚奇了；今又得到西方撚意兩國的援助，當然更是「如虎生翼」，必要繼續作更嚴重的表現。希特勒和莫梭里尼都是聞名世界的「怪傑」，都是和平的最大敵人。過去他們會放過許多大砲，撕毀過許多國際條約，侮辱和蹂躪了全世界的弱小民族和被壓迫伪人類乃至一般自由主義者，現在有了東方的日本爲他們聲援，那當然也更要促使他們向全世界的和平勢力進攻的。本來「物以類聚」，以那樣的德意日三國結成一個集團並不足怪，但從此歐洲和太平洋上的安全，世界的和平，弱小民族和一般被壓迫者的命運，便要受到更大更有力的威脅；過去它們的侵略行動還是個別的，現在是更成爲有組織有計劃的集體行動了。</p>
<p>德日意的結成集團，拿世界各個國家來　，當然最受威脅的是蘇聯；因爲蘇聯的社會制度與它們的根本不同，蘇聯的和平外交，也與它們的侵略行動相矛盾，在各方面都是對立的。除蘇聯之外，就是英美法等列强也同樣受着它們的嚴重威脅。至於如中國等弱小民族，那更是痛感到了侵峪勢力之增大的。請先拿英國來說吧。</p>
<p>德日協定宣布成立後，倫教政界卽表示驚惶疑懼。同時「標準晚報」且傳出消息，說德日恊　附有秘密條件，其大要是：「（一）將荷屬東印度羣島劃分爲德日兩國勢力範圍，（二）解決戰前德國在太平洋各島屬之問題」。換言之，卽是把荷屬東印度之婆羅洲與西里伯兩島作爲日本的勢力範圍，而以蘇門答臘與爪哇兩島作爲德國的勢力範圍；同時德國聲明放棄戰前在太平洋所屬的馬利亞納，加羅林，馬紹爾各羣島（現係日本委任統治地）的一切權利。如果這是事實，那日本的南進將更爲便利，因而英國在南洋乃至在印度緬甸，在整個太平洋上的權利亦將要受到更大的威脅。卽使這私密條件完全是「謠傳」，哪由於德意的援助，日本勢力在中（國在太平祥上也要特別膨脹，英國在東方的安全也是很成問題的。同時，英國現刻方與意大利爭霜於地中海上，而東京與羅馬却大演其雙簧：意大利結好於日本，日本也承認了阿國爲意大利領土，這也是英國所不高興的；雖然莫梭里尼爲了要與英國成立地中海「紳士協定」，一時不願參加德日協定，但在倫針看來，東西兩個敵人聚在一起，打得火熱，於牠總有不利。因此，德日和意日兩協定都爲倫敦所反對；這不僅在輿論方面可以見到，即政府當局的言論也可表明。然而，希特勒偏不知趣，他還令德國駐英大使探詢鮑爾溫能否參加德日反共恊定，這結果是硬硬地碰了一個釘子，老奸巨滑的鮑爾溫居然也板着面孔表示「拒絕考慮」他所提的問題。</p>
<p>美國雖然離遠東較遠，並曾迭决表示不願過問歐洲的事，但侵略勢力的大團集，日本勢力在太平洋上的增長，也是華盛頓所不願樂聞的。所以，德日和竟日兩協定成立消息傳出後，美國雖表示一貫的「中立態度，但對於德日意結成集團之新形勢仍非常注意，並已深切感到了世界和平的大受威脅；至於美國輿論，那更是明白表示出了反對意見的。</p>
<p>對於德意日集團感受很大威脅的還有法國。近年以來，希特勒的一切破壞國際條約的資險行動，早已使得法國感到了自身的安全問題；巴黎方面爲此曾與推行和平政策的蘇聯訂立公約，並積極拉攏英國以防止侵略勢力的發展。那時候，希特勒還表示非常憤慨，說和平集　是危　和平的、並　　這個口實再行撕毁　際條約，在萊茵河岸高架大砲對準巴黎。但是現在呢？希特勒自身也與意日結成了集團，東面準備進攻法蘇協定的簽訂者蘇聯，威脅太平洋上的和乎，西方更是直接威脅了法國的安全。現在，希特勒和莫梭里尼已公然將中歐劃爲他們的勢力範圍，將捷克與奧大利作爲德國的侵略對象，將匈牙利和南斯拉夫算做意大利的侵略區域，這不僅使中歐各小國感到了自身的存亡問題，就是法國也要大感不安的，因爲中歐各小國乃是法國的屏障。所以，德意日集團成立後，法國當局即嬰「採取預防措置」，以保障歐洲的安全；而巴黎報紙更是一致的加以反對，並喚起法國人民起來保衛世界和平。</p>
<p>依據上面的分析，我們可以見到一面是侵略勢力的大團集，威脅世界和平與各國的安全，另一面則是世界許多國家對於侵略主義之反對與防禦。當今之世，是「魔高一丈，道也高一丈」的，破壞和平的勢力一發展，保衛和平的勢力也是在發展的；不然殘酷的戰神恐怕早已降臨人間了。看吧，對於侵略勢力的團集，法蘇與中國已表示了堅决的反對，英美也表示了不與贊助，甚至連一向跟隨在希特勒和莫梭里尼屁股後面的波蘭和奧國也不願參加他們的集團，這些都是對侵略主義者的具體答案。自然，我們還不能說世界和平已獲得保陣，弱小民族的解放已有了更有利的條件，反之，由於侵略集團的成立，戰爭危機是更爲迫切了，弱小民族的解放已增加了一些困難，担是，侵略勢力要　　　勝利恐怕也不過是一個幻　　。</p>

<h3 id="c174">本市各界援綏運動素描 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 飛虹</p>
<p>「援綏」！這聲浪如同「一二八」時候的大炮一樣，在上海震動着大家耳鼓，同時，更有全國一致的廣大的共鳴，使這沈悶了極長久時期的上海好像在寂靜夜裏高舉起無量數的火炬。不能長征漢北，親眼去看那烽火連天，奮勇抗敵救亡情景的筆者，對於本市這已舉起的火炬，也感到它的光芒是不亞於前線的烽火呢。</p>
<p>「有錢的人出錢！」在這種呼聲下我們看到許多衣冠楚楚的人們，在他們的公事房，寫字間，休息室，俱樂部裏三個五個，十個八個地集議着。有的響應「一日運動」，大家向會計先生申明，願拿每月薪金中的一天，全數捐出，大家集腋成裘，匯了去援綏。這裏面包括了公務和事務員，工商界管理人和職員等等。他們在那要集議了以後，便預備好一張大白紙，在前面寫上些如下的字句：</p>
<p>「全國援綏運動，大家都應一致！我們也是中華民族一份子，愛國不敢後人。所以經若干人的集議，在每人每月收入內，捐出一天。集腋成裘，匯到前線去。請大家簽名！」</p>
<p>在這下面，我們便可看到許多名字。有的用墨筆，有的用鋼筆，有的用鉛筆。但都簽得非常爽快流利，在字面上表示出心甘情願的態度。</p>
<p>我離開了衣冠楚楚的人們到了街上，雖然已是朔風怒號，冷氣逼人的時候，但那不爲名不爲利而冒着寒風的童子軍們，三三五五地已在街頭活動勸募捐欵了。有幾個女童軍走到我面前，她們伸出手來，已凍得成了紫紅色；說話的聲音，也是顫抖着：身體也索索地搖着。她們異口同音地說：</p>
<p>「先生！今天的天氣很冷吧？那在比上海酷寒十倍的冰天雪地中的綏北將士們，可更需要我們的援助呢！」</p>
<p>簡短的語句刺痛我的心，我在溫暖的內衣袋裏摸出了一張角票，很慚愧地交給她們，無意中觸着一隻鐵冷的手掌，更使我感到異樣的興奮！</p>
<p>在另一些去處，我看見一些童軍們從一二衣冠不整的工友模樣的人身邊走過，他們並沒有向他倆要捐錢。但那兩個工友却每人自動地掏出了十幾個銅板交給他們說：</p>
<p>「這是好事情！辛苦了你們，我也捐一點！」</p>
<p>這是在所謂工廠區域中，我便訪問到一家相熟的工廠裏去。這裏面本不可以自由行動的，不過，因爲我和經理以及管理人都有相當友誼，所以一經進了門，便可隨我怎麼跑。在一面緊張工作而一面偷空談兩句的一個工塲內，我看見大多數面有菜色，營養不足的工友們，其中有一個健談者在播送新聞：</p>
<p>「打匪軍可不就是打××嗎？眞痛快！大家又像「一二八」時候在捐欵了！有一處牢裏的犯人還餓了一天飯，把來當捐欵哩！」</p>
<p>「我們也多少捐些！好幾個人異口同聲的說。</p>
<p>「工會裏已經商量得有辦法了！」一個人提醒着。</p>
<p>「讓他們在我們工錢裏面或是存工裏面多少扣點好了！」</p>
<p>「扣存工！倒不妨請他們扣得好看些！」</p>
<p>「人一多就好看了！總是成千成百匯去的！」</p>
<p>「哈！哈！哈！」一陣自己安慰的笑聲。</p>
<p>這時我也摻合了苦笑一陣，我於是再到別處去。</p>
<p>這是一個首先發起捐助絲棉背心的某一個女子中學校，我隨着一位攝影記者跑進去。她們在那裏做棉衣的地方是自修課室，剪刀聲和細語聲相唱合着。冷不防我們走進去時，還聽着哼着桃李刦的畢業歌和義勇軍進行曲：</p>
<p>「同學們，大家起來，担負起天下的興亡！」</p>
<p>「不願做奴隸的人們！起來！冒着敵人的炮火，前進！」</p>
<p>沉重的空氣把大夥兒一致的精神凝固在嚴肅的工作上面，大家正在埋頭縫紉着。在一張形似大餐台的木桌上，已堆積了好幾伴做成的絲綿背心。摸上去很柔軟，面子是愛國布，裏子是素色布，大槪長的兩尺四五寸。這是預備給襯在軍服裏面穿，可以束在軍褲腰裏，想像起來，必定是溫軟而適用的。</p>
<p>「淑女手中線，戰士身上衣！」</p>
<p>他們眞是在實踐着：「和平，奮鬥，救中國！」</p>
<p>隨便你跑到那裏去探聽：無論是斯文的，激烈的，興奮的，冷靜的……誰都在各盡其力地，踴躍捐輸，設法募集。報上每天看見援綏團體活動消息；工廠商店通告牌上貼着援綏活動消息；學校的壁報大字煌煌。文藝界捐稿費書畫潤例的聲明；學生作文題目；商店大减價理由之一；影片商，跳舞塲，酒館，飯店，都無不以此相勗勉號召！</p>
<p>把紙醉金迷的上海給戴上了一個民族救亡運動的防毒面罩似的！啊，偉大熱烈的援綏運動！</p>

<h3 id="c176">哲學消滅問題 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 史基</p>
<p>「哲學不僅是解釋世界而已，而且在改變世界。」又有人說，「新哲學一日把握了大衆，便成了大衆的精神的武器。」這樣看來，哲學在現在是很重要的。而且，哲學已有其數千年的歷史，到了現在，不惟沒有發見其式徵，反而展開了嶄新的天地。由哲學之過去和現在的地位，似乎可見在最近的將來牠也不會消滅的。</p>
<p>但是又有人在那裏主張哲學消滅論。有些是以自然科學者的立塲出來反對哲學的。關於這點，已有人討論過了　　自然研究者總以爲只要一輕蔑哲學，溺駡哲學，就可以從哲學常中解放出來了。但是他們沒有思惟，就連一步也不能前進。而爲了這個思維，理論的規定是必要的。」所以哲學仍屬必要。也有些楚以哲　者的立塲出來取消哲學的。在蘇俄則有史提潘諾夫等，在中國，這問題　在也正鬧得很激烈。所以我們有提出來加以討論之必要。</p>
<p>旣然一方面有人主張哲學消滅論，那同時自然就會有許多人反對這種意見，說哲學不會消滅的。那些以目然科學者的立塲來反對哲學的，其所提理由完全是機械的素樸的物質論的見解，這早已有人反駁過了，這兒用不着再述。至於以哲學者的立塲來主張哲學消滅的人，其所持的理由以及那反駁他的人所持的理由，那倒須得介紹介紹。道兒我們可分做兩方面來說。第一點是理論的，第二點是文獻的。自然，其理論的根據也是源於其所理解的文獻，不過，在其所援引的文獻之外，他自己總有一套邏輯。所以大略可分爲兩方面說。當然，這兩派都自認是站在新哲學的立塲，而其所根據的文獻也是共通的。</p>
<p>我們現在先從文獻方面來考察：</p>
<p>哲學消滅論者所依據的文獻如次：「哲學是隨着黑格兒而一般地終止，一方面因爲他把整個發展大規模地撮述成他的體系，別方面他縱然無意識地却實在給我們指示出在體系的迷宮外達到世界之實證的眞正的道路」（恩格思，反杜林論）。「近代唯物論，不是簡單地使舊時唯物論重現，而是把二千年來的哲學，自然科學的發展以及二千年歷史本身發展上的整個思想內容，加於堅固的唯物論的基礎之上。一般的論來，這已經不再是哲學，而是單純的宇宙觀，牠應該不是在某種特殊的科學之科塵上，而是在現實的科學上找得自己的立證，並表現自己的作用。這樣，哲學就被「揚棄」，在形式上被克服，在實際內容上却被保留起來」（前書）。</p>
<p>從上面的根據，哲學消滅論者　結論說，這便是「哲學之終結」。</p>
<p>在另一方面，反對他的人又引出了許多的文獻來：「領會了一千五百年間的哲學發展的成果之後，自然科學一方面可以脫離特殊的，離牠面立，處牠之上的自然哲學，他方面可以脫離牠自己的從英國經騐　義傳來的狹　的思惟方法，（反朴林論）「哲學從自然界和歷史中被驅逐出來以後，祗剩下一個地域可以給牠　身了。這個地域就是純粹思想：研究思想規律的　說－邏輯和辯證法。」（宗教哲學與社會主義）「自然科學及歷史科學探用辯證法於其中的時候，一切的　學的廢物－純粹的思惟的　說以外的東西－始成爲贅物，而消失於實證科學之中了。」（書簡集第四卷）</p>
<p>依據上說，反對者便結論說，恩格斯所消滅的哲學是自然哲學和歷史哲學，是離科學而獨立，處於科學之上的舊哲學，而「邏輯和辯證法」還是未消滅的。</p>
<p>這是文獻上兩派的論爭。</p>
<p>我們再從理論方面來看兩者所持的理由：</p>
<p>哲學消滅論者以爲一切都是運動的，變化的，一切東西都有發生，發展，死亡，故而哲學也有其死亡，消滅。哲學自從離宗敎而獨立時，牠便是否定了宗敎；現在科學又離哲學而獨立，於是科學便要否定哲學，而哲學便消滅了。</p>
<p>反對者則說：科學發達，哲學自然也有被否定的，但是被否定的是哲學中之舊哲學，如自然哲學和歷史哲學，而不是將全部哲學，連同辯證物質論－「邏輯和辯證法」－也都吾定了。所以哲學並未消滅。而且辯證法是關於自然，社會，思惟之運動的一般的法則，而科學則爲宇宙之部分的法則的研究，所以科學還應需要哲學爲之指導，綜括，科學並不能代替哲學。</p>
<p>同時根據哲學消滅論者的意思，他所消滅的，他認爲要自行消滅的哲學，也只是「舊哲學」，「哲學的哲學」，至於那新哲學的辯證物質論－「科學的哲學」－也不在消滅之列。</p>
<p>那麼這兩派的主張結果不是要達到同樣的結論了嗎？兩者都說哲學之被消滅的是舊哲學，觀念論的哲學，自然哲學，歷史哲學或「哲學的哲學」，而「科學的哲學」則並未消滅，而且也無人企圖，也無人能够去消滅牠。這樣看來，這兩者的論爭似乎只是名詞上的論爭，商且只是對於哲學一名詞之涵義的範圍的論爭。據前者，是把舊哲學之消滅看作整個哲學之消減，故得出哲學消滅論：在後者，則要分別地說，舊哲學之消滅並不是整個哲學之消滅。道在最近兩派的論爭文字之中，充分可以看出的。　　　是　　據也不　單羣讒這就　是名詞的涵義上的論爭而已。在哲舉消滅論者，以爲辯證物質論已不是哲學了，而實在是成了科學的理論去了。因之，哲學這一名詞已一般地失去其存在意義，而存在的則只有科學。而在另一方面，反對者又認爲譸設物質論並不就是科學，牠雖是「科學的」哲學，但究竟還是哲學，不過不同於「非科學的」哲學而已。而且現在的科學還正需要這新哲學，不離科學而立，不處於科學之上的哲學去指導牠。所以哲學仍然存在。</p>
<p>哲學消減論者爲要消滅哲學，就又另立了一門思維科學，認爲哲學所能保留的唯一地盤－純粹思想－也可爲科學的領域，這樣一來，哲學便沒有地方可容身了。但同時又有人反對思惟科學之建立，又有人以爲科學是研究一般的運勳法則，因之思惟科學之能否建立，對於哲學之是否就會消滅沒有關係。</p>
<p>從上面看來，哲學是否消滅這一個問題，現在可說還是一個未經解决的問題。我們希望一切哲學研究者熱心來參加這個論爭，從文獻上從理論上來論證。同時又希望對於思惟科學之建立問題，以及思惟科學之建立與哲學是否消滅一問題，二者一齊加以研究。</p>
<p>還有，在中國哲學界上，觀念論與物質論是否可以綜合的問題，現在也閙得非常的激烈。我們在這裏要說的，是這問顯與哲糾消滅問題也有關係一點。因爲主張二者可以綜合的人說，哲學之有歷史，卽是哲學之所以能成爲哲學，是因爲有觀念論和物質論二者之矛盾，鬥爭，哲學就是這矛盾對立的產物。如果這兩個對立的東西統一起來了，那論爭就會消滅，因而哲學也將消滅。但是這二者是否　能統一，統一了這二者又是否就消滅了哲學，這尙是一個待研究的問題。這也是要歸併在前一項裏面去討論的。</p>

<h3 id="c177">看護小姐 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 蓉女士</p>
<p>第一天工作所給我的印象，除了窒息的藥味外，使我奇怪地覺得與二年前的工廠生活沒有兩樣。若定要找出它的差異罷，　就只有稱呼上的不同，以前作工是被人喊名字的，現在作看護就一變而被喊爲小姐了。所謂小姐不過帶了一點洋氣，若眞的是閨閣小姐，又有誰肯替病人幹那些骯髒的東西，甚至最下等的事都要動手呢！從晨七時至晚七時，這十二點鐘裏我們沒有自由休息的時間，譬如我在診察室裏工作，單是每天照例要做的，從揩藥瓶，消毒，以及預備每天要用的藥，整理診察室，醫案等瑣碎的事，就足足要化上一兩小時。每每到了早晨八點多鐘，病人來就診了，而我們的工作還沒有完全預備好，於是得用護士慣會對人說謊的技倆，騙病人說：「請你們等一等，醫生就要來了。」實則醫生是要我們去請了才來的。有時我們的工作好久才完，又恐病人等得不耐煩，發急，於是我們得用同樣的口吻再去哄騙病人。等到我們這部份工作完畢了，診室裏總是坐滿了病入，這時我們就樂得用好聽的話封病人說：「什麼，醫生還不來，我去喊一聲吧。」病人照例回答「謝謝！」表示戚激。</p>
<p>醫生喊來了，我們要做醫生助手的事。我們時時刻刻地注意着，醫生需要什麼，就將什麼送上去，而且要迅速，靈敏。在夏天，醫生的手消毒過的，我們要替他揩去臉上的汗。這工作，我由老學生的領導，也曾幹過。開始的幾天，我覺得這工作太下流了，不啻是我們在薦頭店裏，被醫院喊去作粗工的女僕，實則我們還不及她們呢，她們每個月倒還有三四元的工錢，而我們却還要送錢給醫院裏。自然，醫院裏也說得怪好聽的：免費學習，只收膳費，實在我們學些什麼呢？每天本來有一點鐘書好讀，但事實上最多一星期上一兩點鐘課吧。</p>
<p>有一天，我的工作特別忙，差不多整夫沒休息，而醫生又是貪玩得很，稍有餘暇，卽不知去向，一下這個要來看病，那個要來看病，於是我們束找西尋地去找醫生，就找也够累了，何况還要做事呢！回到宿舍裏和同學們談起這事，同學李女士聽了說：「像你在耳鼻科做，要算最寫意，又沒有極骯髒的病人，像我在病房裏做最苦了。昨夜一刻兒都沒有休息過，全是重病的，這裏沒忙好，那邊接着電鈴又來了。二十號病人最壞，無緣無故撳電鈴，去了說是：他寂寞得很，呌我們去解解悶，這種人簡直把我們看護當作消遣品，眞氣死人－還有三十號的產婦和十六號那個梅毒患者，討厭極了，時時撳電鈴，去了又是那麼麻煩，要這樣那樣，忙個不了。那個梅毒患者已是四十多歲的人了，而總想同我們說笑話，不敷衍他呢，那他會告訴看護長的，說某看護不好一類的話，於是我們就難免要被記一個大過，顧，王就是個例子，所以不得不敷衍他幾句。可是他的事實在也眞够麻煩，什麼：「今天的藥敷得不舒服，給我再換一决好嗎？」每每被他說得不能不換，然而替他敷藥這種事，眞令人不好意思呢。」</p>
<p>「你還沒有做過外科呢。趙搶眘對我說：「那些爛頭爛脚的病人，旣髒又臭，然而我們是要替這些病人洗去膿水的。有時我們稍一大意，把自己洗過爛東西後不曾消毒的手在臉上一摸，就說不定會患起同樣的瘡來。」</p>

Three Divisions of Puppet Troops Concentrate in Chahar Province. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Guihua) Eight communist planes dropped over a hundred bombs on Bai Ling Temple on the 5th. Our army suffered no losses. After the pseudo-communist army's counterattack on Bai Ling Temple failed, they retreated to Damiaozi. Two thousand of Wang Ying's bandit troops were sent to reinforce them. Wang himself is also at Damiaozi, in a very sorry state. The communist army currently lacks the ability to counterattack Bai Ling Temple. Our army plans to eliminate them soon. The east of Sui Province is pacified. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) It is reported that three divisions of the puppet Manchukuo army are concentrating in northern Chahar in three routes. Those currently mixed within the pseudo-bandits are all wearing Mongolian attire. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Wang Ying is already under house arrest in Shangdu. His movements are followed and monitored by his own people. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Over the past two days, communist planes have dropped over two hundred bombs on Bai Ling Temple. We have eight wounded and one dead. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The communist army that attacked Bai Ling Temple suffered a crushing defeat after being severely attacked by the national army on the 3rd and 4th. On the 5th, they dared not launch another large-scale invasion. However, at noon on the 5th, a certain party sent eight planes which successively bombed the temple area, dropping over a hundred bombs. Fortunately, the national army's defenses were effective, and they did not suffer any losses. (5th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that the enemy at Guandimiao Nanxiang Village near Wuchuan has been completely wiped out by our Sun Changsheng's cavalry sweep. Apart from the remaining bandits who were captured and disarmed, most fled towards the desert wilderness of the Sizi Mongol tribe. The night of the 4th was extremely cold, and the areas where the remaining enemy fled were desolate and uninhabited. Nineteen will likely freeze to death. Our Wuchuan defense is consolidated. (5th Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that the Koukou military headquarters is currently selecting over two thousand junior officers from various divisions in the Northeast and from among the puppet troops, and dispatching them to northern and eastern Sui Province in batches to be incorporated into the puppet army. The intention is to increase the strength of the puppet army. The reorganization of the puppet troops between Jiabusi, Damiao, and Shangdu is very busy. The puppet army expenses are now being borne by the puppet Jidong government, ordered by a certain military headquarters, with a monthly payment of three million. De Wang is extremely resentful and remains ill in Jiabusi without improvement. The Mongol people of the Sizi tribe, unable to bear the demands of a certain party, are fleeing towards their herds and the Hou Tao area. There are too many stationed puppet troops in Jining and northern Chahar, and supplies are insufficient. The puppet army's daily food intake is restricted, so the number of those freezing and starving to death increases daily. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) No fighting is currently occurring at Bai Ling Temple, but fighting is occurring at the Lama Temple. Most of the Chinese army that recently recovered the Lama Temple has now moved several miles east and is currently preparing to directly attack Jiabusi.

<p>(Nanjing) A Japanese newspaper in Shanghai published a Domei News Agency report on the 4th about the meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawaagoe on October 3rd, which was completely untrue.

(5th Day Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, newspapers here have editorials on Sino-Japanese negotiations, but the opinions are extremely inconsistent. The Asahi Shimbun criticized the Japanese government for its vacillating attitude and questioned why the Japanese government did not adopt a plan for the North China issue and seek real rather than merely nominal results. The newspaper believes that resolving the North China and anti-communist issues, even without being hindered by minor incidents, is extremely difficult. The newspaper concludes that if problems that can be solved cannot be solved, it is best for Japan not to adhere to its original policy and advocates temporarily suspending all negotiations except for the Chengdu case, etc., to wait for a future opportunity. The Jiji Shimbun also believes that opening up the deadlock is extremely hopeless and points out three paths that Japan can choose from: (1) Resolutely declare the failure of achieving Japan's goals autonomously; (2) Temporarily suspend all negotiations to wait for a future opportune time to continue them; (3) Conclude all points that both sides have agreed on and compile basic questions for adjusting relations for future discussion.

Hainan Island is rich in products and is our country's only tropical region. In addition to ships, there are also civil aviation planes connecting with the provincial capital. If the island's transportation is developed first in the future, there will be no difficulty in developing and operating it. There are many people from the sixteen counties of Hainan Island in the province, Hong Kong, and overseas. I deeply hope that they will use their experience and strength to return to their hometowns to participate in development undertakings. As a member of the Hainanese people, I will do my best to assist them. The warm hospitality of the local authorities and elders in Hainan is especially appreciated. Guangxi is rich in minerals and urgently needs to be developed. Director Li and Commissioner Bai are both old friends who have recently telegraphed me to meet and talk with them, so I plan to visit Guangxi within days. (5th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The newspaper strongly stated that China's ability to overcome the extremely sharp financial crisis of the past year shows that the Chinese authorities have the ability to boldly solve huge problems. The newspaper also mentioned the improvement of China's tariffs, stating that China's tariff-secured loans can be repaid on time without any delays, and believes that this will continue to be the case in the future, so there is no problem. Therefore, China's credit has improved a lot, and foreign financial circles are also happy to invest.

<p>(Nanjing) The central government held a commemoration of the 21st anniversary of the Zhaohe Warship Uprising at 9:00 AM on the 5th.

Chairman Ju Zheng presided over the ceremony, and after the music played and everyone saluted, he delivered a speech, stating briefly that everyone was already well aware of the Zhaohe Uprising, so there was no need to elaborate. He pointed out that at the time, there were only a few dozen revolutionary comrades, led by Mr. Chen Yintu, who fought against Yuan Shikai's nearly ten thousand strong army with bare hands and created this great achievement. What did they rely on? It was the revolutionary spirit alone. During the second and third years of the Republic, the revolutionary atmosphere was extremely depressed. Most people not only did not consider our party as the creator of the Republic but also believed that the Republic belonged to none other than Yuan Shikai. However, after the Zhaohe Uprising, the whole country was shocked, and the revolutionary atmosphere swept across the country. The spirit of comrades everywhere was invigorated. Currently, our party occupies the leading position in the government, with authority and power, and revolutionary work should be easier to promote. However, in recent years, this has not been the case, because all comrades are considering various difficulties when doing things, lacking the spirit of forging ahead regardless of everything as in those years. Especially today, with the serious national crisis and the rebellion of the bandits, it is hoped that all comrades will strive with the revolutionary spirit and courage of those years, seeking only the success of the revolution and not considering other concerns. Today, in commemorating the Zhaohe Uprising, I offer this sentiment to everyone. After Ju finished his speech, the music played, and the meeting adjourned.

<p>(Tianjin) Sun Weidong returned to Tianjin from Beijing on the morning of the 5th and is scheduled to visit Zhu in Ping on the 6th to report. Sun said that the losses due to smuggling in the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs offices in North China from January to October this year amounted to a definite total of 16 million. Smuggling is now rampant again. Although transportation does not use railways, the situation is as serious as in early summer. Last year, the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs offices collected a total of more than 39 million. It is estimated that by the end of this year, they can only collect a maximum of 20 million. He reported to the Ministry of Finance during this trip to Beijing and conveyed the opinions of the Hebei-Chahar Committee. He had detailed discussions with various parties. Now, he will report the results of the discussions to Song, and a decision on how to thoroughly crack down on smuggling will be made after the Ministry and the North China authorities agree. Li Tonghua and An Si'er cannot come north for the time being. The regulations there stipulate that an office should be set up in Tianjin. Although An and Li are not coming, there are people to handle matters. As for the talk of relocating south, it is only reported in the newspapers, and there are no actual preparations for this. There is no proposal to set up an inspection branch on the Ping-Sui Railway. Setting up a branch on the BeiNing Railway has many diplomatic difficulties and requires detailed discussion.

<h3 id="e20">Legislative Yuan Holds Eighth Anniversary Celebration; Sun Ke Hopes to Perfect Legislation During the Tutelage Period; Aims to Make Our Country a Modern Country Ruled by Law <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held an eighth-anniversary celebration at 10:00 AM on the 5th. The ceremony was simple but solemn. Attendees included Central and National Government representatives Zhang Ji, guests Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Chen Jianru, Lin Guanchou, Wang Hantao, He Chongshan, and all members and staff of the Yuan, totaling over two hundred people. President Sun led the ceremony, and after everyone saluted, he delivered a report. First, he provided a historical account of the establishment of the Five-Yuan system and the arduous work of the late President Hu in legislative affairs. He then said that since he took office at the Legislative Yuan, he was fortunate to have the unity and cooperation of his colleagues. Over the years, some progress has been made. Although he is ashamed that he has not been able to carry forward the legislative spirit of the past, he has firmly adhered to the consistent regulations of the past eight years, which he considers very fortunate. He continued to say that the term of the current Legislative Committee is about to expire according to law. The original plan was to have the National Assembly produce a new Legislative Committee at the end of this year in accordance with the constitution to connect with the work of the current Legislative Committee and begin the legislation of the constitutional period. However, because the National Assembly has been postponed, the original plan has also changed. Roughly speaking, there will still be a considerable amount of time before the National Assembly is convened, and the current Legislative Committee will still need to be extended to serve as a transition. Sun concluded by saying that the legislation of the constitutional period in the future will enter a new stage, but it will still need to be based on the experience and degree of the tutelage period. He especially hoped to perfect the legislative achievements of the tutelage period in order to promote our country to become a modern country ruled by law. As for the general situation of legislation in the eighth year of the Yuan, because there is a separate written report, Sun did not elaborate to the audience. Representative Zhang was then invited to speak. Zhang said that the world's legislative system has evolved to form four major groups: the old democratic faction of Britain and the United States, the socialist faction of the Soviet Union, the fascist faction of Germany and Italy, and the Three Principles of the People faction of our country. The first three are criticized by the world, and their foundations have been shaken. He deeply hoped that the legislative colleagues of our country would use the legislative autonomous spirit of the Three Principles of the People to cope with the world's changes and expand the worldliness of the Three Principles of the People system. Finally, Ma Chaojun gave a speech. Ma, who once served as a Legislative Committee member, compared himself to a married daughter returning home, which was applauded by the audience. He then contributed his thoughts on legislation based on his administrative experience for the reference of his colleagues in the Yuan. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM, and a group photo was taken before adjourning. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e44">A Delicate Stage of Diplomacy <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>At a time when bandit-puppet troops were launching their second fierce attack on Bailing Temple; at a time when over two thousand Japanese troops had landed in Qingdao, searching party headquarters and arresting many people; suddenly, new developments occurred in the diplomatic arena in Nanjing. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 4th, "The sudden meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe on the evening of the 3rd, and the lengthy statement issued by the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing, have caused considerable surprise here." This so-called "surprise" is bound to be puzzling to many who have not seen this lengthy statement. However, based on the facts, we can understand the origins of the "surprise" to some extent. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing, during the talks on the evening of the 3rd, Ambassador Kawagoe presented Foreign Minister Zhang with a document said to be a summary of the past seven talks. However, this record did not match the facts of the talks. Foreign Minister Zhang asked Kawagoe to take it back, but Kawagoe refused. Foreign Minister Zhang then had someone return it to the Japanese Embassy. The embassy sent it back again, and our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent it back again. During this period, the Japanese Embassy issued the so-called diplomatic statement. Following this, Ambassador Kawagoe left Nanjing for Shanghai on the 5th. Because of this scene of comedic back-and-forth, rumors spread that the negotiations had failed. At the same time, political circles in Tokyo expressed extreme "surprise."</p>
<p>Why the surprise? Was it due to the dispute over this document? Yes, but not entirely. Was it out of concern that the negotiations would be interrupted? Yes, but not entirely either. We believe that the biggest reason for the other party's surprise is that we have stood firm and will not allow any further retreat. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are watching the content of the past seven negotiations. This is not something that can be confused with a piece of paper. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people have firmly stood behind the brave men of Suiyuan Province. We are not worried about the interruption of negotiations. In this way, the diplomats who felt things were easy during the Tanggu and Hebei negotiations suddenly encountered a tricky experience. This is probably the reason for the surprise in Tokyo's political circles.</p>
<p>However, in practical terms, the current stage of Sino-Japanese diplomacy has indeed reached a very delicate stage. We cannot but pay close attention to and prepare for this situation. Regarding the progress of the negotiations, according to news from Tokyo and the statements of Ambassador Kawagoe, there is no intention to give up. However, in future negotiations, will this so-called lengthy statement be used as a basis? What the people of China are currently concerned about is that the negotiations must proceed on an equal footing and not allow unilateral oppression. Our position should be to recover lost sovereignty first and not allow any further loss of sovereignty. Does the other party have a full understanding of these two principles?</p>
<p>Naturally, we, the people, are bound to be quite surprised by this so-called lengthy statement. What is even more surprising is that while diplomatic negotiations are underway, the same opposing side has planes and tanks attacking Bailing Temple, and large numbers of troops from the same opposing side have invaded our Qingdao. What a surprising way to conduct diplomacy!</p>
<p>However, amidst the surprise, we are not afraid, because the millions of soldiers and civilians of our country have stood very firm and cannot retreat any further.</p>
<h3 id="e45">French Foreign Minister Announces Foreign Policy: Should England and Belgium be Invaded, Military Assistance Will Be Decisive <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies began discussing foreign policy this afternoon. Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a speech, the main points of which were: "I hereby declare on behalf of the French government that if England and Belgium are invaded without provocation, France will immediately provide the full military force of its naval, land, and air forces to defend England and Belgium." As for the "fire" within Spain, France has made every effort to extinguish it, preventing it from spreading. The purpose of this is solely for the sake of the overall European situation. Referring to the general European situation, he said that the rapprochement between France and Germany is necessary to maintain peace in Europe. "We ask ourselves, we do not want to dominate Europe, nor do we want to encircle Germany. Therefore, the rapprochement between France and Germany is not impossible. The mutual assistance pact between France and Russia has no aggressive nature, and any other country can join." At this point, Delbos reiterated the Spanish issue and elaborated on the Communist Party's advocacy for France to restore free trade with Spain, saying that the majority of the French people support the government's current policy of non-interference. "I personally sympathize with the Spanish Republic, but I am in charge of diplomacy and bear the great responsibility of war and peace, so I cannot be swayed by emotions. Those who demand that the government cancel the non-interference agreement, once they seize power, their actions will not be any different." Subsequently, right-wing member Renault spoke, saying that France should be militarily closer to the Soviet Union, but this is impossible while the People's Front government is in power, because French public opinion is wary of the current government's excessive sympathy for the Third International. Therefore, "only a government that is completely unaffected by the Communist Party can promote close cooperation between the French and Russian general staffs." The Chamber of Deputies then adjourned, and decided to continue the meeting tomorrow, at which time two motions will be proposed to end the debate: one is a motion on the policy of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, and the other is a vote of confidence in the government. It is expected that the Communist Party will abstain from voting on the first motion and will vote in favor of the second motion. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Government officials are very satisfied with the foreign policy speech delivered by French Foreign Minister Delbos in the French Chamber of Deputies yesterday, believing that it is an automatic response to Foreign Secretary Eden's previous speech in Leamington, and it is also of great benefit to clarifying the relationship between England, France, and Belgium. In addition, the cooperation between England, France, and Belgium does not want to exclude other countries, which will increase the difficulty of negotiating the new Locarno Pact. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels French Foreign Minister Delbos said in his speech in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, "If England and Belgium are invaded by other countries without provocation, France will immediately provide full military assistance." Government officials here have expressed their satisfaction, believing that Belgium's policy of complete independence does not hinder the friendship between France and Belgium, which can be clearly demonstrated here.

<p>(Geneva) Following the resolution passed by the League of Nations Assembly in July of this year, requesting member states to express their opinions on the issue of amending the Covenant, the Dutch government submitted a proposal to the League of Nations Secretariat today. It is stated that the goal of the League of Nations is to establish a system of collective security, but as long as the major powers do not join the League of Nations, the system of collective security cannot be effectively implemented. Therefore, the act of amending the Covenant is unlikely to achieve practical results. For now, the League of Nations must not allow any difficulties that would prevent non-member states from joining or rejoining the League of Nations to become more serious. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) After a busy week in Parliament, Prime Minister Baldwin's official statement in the House of Commons yesterday has come to an end. Judging from the current situation, the Labour Party minority is quite willing to discuss the King's marriage, the opposition Liberal Party has split internally, and the Conservative Party minority opposes the King's abdication. Baldwin will remain at 10 Downing Street this week and will not go to Chequers for a rest. When the House of Commons met yesterday to listen to the Prime Minister's statement, the atmosphere was tense, which is rare in the history of the House of Commons. Because the Prime Minister has not yet reached a solution, his statement, although not a final conclusion, has clearly stated that a certain compromise cannot be established. When the Prime Minister entered the House and when he issued the statement, there was thunderous applause. After the meeting, members gathered in groups in various parts of the House to discuss the national crisis. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin met with the King at Belvidere Palace at around 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the opinions of the governments of the various Dominions on the King marrying Mrs. Simpson. He left after fifty minutes and returned to London, and will meet with Home Secretary Simon at 9:30 PM. Therefore, there will be no incidents tonight, but no concrete decisions were made last night. The Cabinet met all day yesterday and plans to meet again at 10:00 AM this morning. Negotiations are still underway with representatives of the various Dominions in England. The Dominions may continue to express their opinions on this matter. Those in charge believe that the Prime Minister's statement in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the government is not prepared to propose legislation to facilitate the King's marriage, has brought the overall situation to its final stage, but it is not yet possible to determine when the British King's decision will be known. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to information from those close to the government, this afternoon, the hope of avoiding the King's abdication has not been completely extinguished, but it has become increasingly slim. The final decision now rests on the King's word. There is no room for manoeuvre if the Cabinet does not approve of the King marrying Mrs. Simpson. Lloyd's of London has now stopped underwriting coronation insurance. The coronation robes ordered from Shanghai have all been cancelled in the past forty-eight hours, which shows the severity of the situation. (4th China Press Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet is now scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning to discuss the declaration to be made to Parliament on the 1st of next week, and to study the opinions of the representatives of the various Dominions. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The governments of the various British Dominions are now playing an increasingly important role in the turmoil caused by the British King's insistence on marrying Mrs. Simpson. According to the Statute of Westminster 1931, the consent of the various Dominions is also necessary for the British King's abdication. What the Cabinet meeting discussed yesterday was entirely how to respond to the inquiries of the representatives of the various Dominions in England. The representatives of Canada and South Africa in England have become the central figures in the negotiations today. They held discussions with Dominions Secretary MacDonald, Prime Minister Baldwin, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain last night. At the same time, the Australian Cabinet met in Canberra, but adjourned to await further news from London. New Zealand public opinion demands an early resolution to the matter, but advocates for the British King to remain in his position. The situation in India is quite shocking.

<p>(London) Archbishop of Canterbury Lang issued a declaration today, hoping that public speakers in general will not directly discuss issues affecting the King and the nation later this week, because in certain extremely difficult and delicate situations, it is not only unhelpful but will also mislead public thought and emotions to rashly talk about them before they are thoroughly understood. Therefore, it is best to remain silent before the final decision is announced. The Archbishop also hopes that people will go to churches to pray on Sunday, so that God may, at this critical juncture, prevent the King and the government from going to extremes and benefit the country.

<p>(London) The English King spent last night at Belveder Villa, overcome with sorrow. It is said that royal physicians are attending to him. The Associated Press has learned from reliable sources that the King has placed the blame for the crisis caused by the marriage issue on the Cabinet. (5th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The English King spent only four hours asleep last night at the villa. The King usually enjoys walking in the garden every morning. He woke up very early this morning, but was not seen going out for a walk. (4th North China Daily News Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the marriage issue of King Edward VIII, the situation has not eased today. The King still seems to insist on marrying Mrs. Simpson, but the Cabinet, Parliament, and representatives of the various dominions do not approve. As such, the talk of Edward VIII's abdication is becoming more credible. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The King spent the entire day secluded at Belveder Villa, with no contact with the outside world, further convincing people that the King is weary of his duties. Judging from the current situation, if the King decides to abdicate, preparations must be made for the succession to the throne. If not, he must notify Parliament that he has abandoned the idea of ​​marriage. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that the Duke of York's succession to the throne would be supported by the church. The church was the main instigator of the crisis caused by the marriage issue. Therefore, the church's opinion on the succession to the throne is of great importance. As for the aristocracy, they believe that a monarch does not need to make any innovations that affect government policy. It is enough if he has excellent character, enough to cultivate himself and manage his family. Moreover, the Duchess of York is of pure character and manages her family well, and has always been admired by the court nobility. If she ascends to the throne as queen, she will surely follow the example of Queen Mary and be a role model for the world. Therefore, they also support the Duke of York's succession to the throne. However, according to well-informed sources, it is not certain whether the Duke of York himself will accept the succession to the throne. It is rumored that the Duke has promised the current King that he will never succeed to the throne. Although this statement is difficult to confirm, it can be asserted that the King's mother, the Queen Mother, and the King's brother discussed the succession to the throne last night. If the Duke of York does not agree to succeed, then the Duke of Gloucester will likely be made King. The Duke of Gloucester recently married the Duchess of Scott, and has no children.

The Cabinet held a special meeting this morning, which lasted for forty-five minutes before adjourning. It was immediately announced that the next meeting was scheduled to be held at 10:30 AM on Monday morning.

After the meeting, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, MacDonald, and Prime Minister continued to talk for twenty minutes. Foreign Secretary Eden also talked with the Prime Minister for half an hour. It was decided that the cabinet meeting would be held at 10:30 AM on Monday morning next week. Today happens to be the weekend, and most cabinet members intend to leave London to rest in the suburbs, but the Prime Minister has notified all cabinet members to be prepared to be summoned to a meeting at any time. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the cabinet meeting this morning, political figures confirmed that if King Edward VIII insists on the marriage issue, the cabinet will submit its resignation. It is said that after the political crisis occurs, it will be impossible to resolve, so the King may change his attitude so that the cabinet can continue to serve. (5th Havas)</p>

<p>(London) A powerful political group has emerged in Parliament, led by Scottish MP Mr. Whichle, to stop Prime Minister Baldwin from forcing King Edward VIII to abdicate. It includes members of all parties and has petitioned the King last night to express their loyalty. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Several members of Parliament petitioned the King today, stating that they are willing to support any action that the King deems necessary to defend his constitutional rights. A group of Conservative Party members of the House of Commons resolved to support the King last night, hence this development. It is not yet known whether Labour and Liberal Party members also petitioned the King today. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The editorials published in various newspapers this morning regarding King Edward VIII's plan to marry Mrs. Simpson as queen have very different tones from each other. Some advocate that the best solution is to dismiss the opponents, while others believe that the future of this matter is very clear, that is, the King can only choose one between the country and the beauty. In addition, several newspapers expressed pessimism. The Daily Herald published a communication from its special correspondent, stating that the possibility of King Edward's abdication has rapidly decreased. Prime Minister Baldwin will soon be able to notify his colleagues that the King has no intention of marrying immediately, because the King has been persuaded by a few close friends to put the matter aside for the time being and not to make an irreversible decision. They also advised the King that if he could be patient for a while, the public's sympathy for the King would increase, and they might even approve of the King's marriage to Mrs. Simpson. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the constitutional dispute caused by the marriage issue, major newspapers such as the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, as well as many political figures, such as Fascist leader Sir Mosley and Conservative MP Wilson, are now supporting the King. More than fifty other Conservative MPs also advocate allowing the King to make a decision at his leisure, without setting a date. The Cabinet, on the other hand, is doing its best to persuade the King to make a decisive decision and not to delay any longer. Political figures officially stated that if King Edward VIII cannot make a decision before Monday or Tuesday of next week, the Cabinet will submit its resignation at that time. However, if the Cabinet resigns, the political situation will inevitably cause serious consequences. According to constitutional norms, after the current Cabinet resigns or is dismissed, the King should appoint the leader of the opposition, the Labour Party leader Attlee, to form a cabinet. However, the Labour Party opposes the marriage more than any other party. At that time, it is almost certain that Major Attlee will refuse to accept the appointment. In this situation, the task of forming a cabinet will still fall to the Conservative Party. At that time, the main figures of the party will inevitably come forward to accept the appointment. If those with less seniority are forced to accept the task, it will be difficult to obtain the support of a majority of members of Parliament. The result will be nothing but dissolving Parliament and holding a general election. Political figures predict that the result of the vote. Those who advocate maintaining the norms of the empire and religion will account for the vast majority, and those who support the King personally will account for a very small minority. As for the rumors circulating outside that the leader of the extreme faction of the Conservative Party, Churchill, is preparing to form a cabinet, most people regard it as absurd, because experienced politicians such as Churchill know that it will be difficult to maintain the cabinet after it is formed, so they will definitely not dare to engage in it rashly. If a new cabinet cannot be formed in the future, then the King's abdication will inevitably be unavoidable. However, after all these twists and turns, it will only slightly delay the abdication, and will still be of no help to the overall situation. Political figures therefore came to a conclusion that if abdication is to be avoided, the King must cancel the marriage proposal, but judging from the current situation, this is very difficult to do. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British political circles are divided into two factions. The faction that supports the King is only a very small minority, and it does not have any political power. As for the cabinet members who support the King's actions, only Secretary of War Duff Cooper and Home Secretary Simon. In addition, the vast majority of political circles do not approve of the King's marriage to Mrs. Simpson. Also, if the King does not abdicate and marries Mrs. Simpson, the cabinet may resign and be reorganized. At that time, the successor to the Prime Minister may be the leader of the extremist Conservative Party, Churchill, which is also unknown. (4th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the crisis caused by the marriage issue of King Edward VIII of England, the right-wing Paris Echo's London correspondent recently declared, "This crisis may have originated from a conspiracy, and those who instigated it behind the scenes are mostly a part of the British political and church circles. These people originally wanted Edward VIII to abandon his position, regardless of the impact." The famous reporter Madame Tabouis officially stated in the L'Oeuvre, "The main figure in this crisis is Prime Minister Baldwin. This man has been plotting to make Edward VIII abdicate for several months." The right-wing Figaro's London correspondent officially stated, "British government and public figures are now divided into two factions. One faction supports the King, including some members of the opposition Labour Party and Liberal Party, as well as the extremist Conservative Party members led by former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill. They believe that King Edward VIII is intelligent and capable. If he abdicates, it will put Britain in a dangerous situation. On the contrary, if Churchill comes forward to form a cabinet, even if it is put to a public vote, it can obtain the support of the majority. The other faction opposes the King. The cabinet members of the Conservative Party and church figures all belong to this faction." (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Last night, about 300 people gathered outside the Prime Minister's residence and Buckingham Palace, singing the national anthem and seeking to see the King, which shows the people's love for the King. Most of these were young men and women who gathered in front of the palace gates, singing "We love King Edward and love Prime Minister Baldwin," causing a disturbance for a long time until the police dispersed them. There were also many students in the crowd, carrying banners with the slogans "Tonight we cheer for our King in the palace" and "Having been to South Wales, we cannot allow it to collapse." The latter refers to the King's recent inspection of the impoverished areas of South Wales and his efforts to improve the situation there. Another small team of young people sang the national anthem outside the residence of the Duke and Duchess of York in Piccadilly. Each group was dispersed by the police with warnings.

<h3 id="e59">Amidst National Army Suppression, Puppet Regime in Chahar Collapses Internally, Certain Party Issues Military Pay for Three General Offensives, Secretly Sends Large Number of Traitors to Destroy Transportation in Eastern Suiyuan, De Wang, Coerced by Certain Party, Decides to Lead Troops Westward Immediately, Jiabusi Temple Urgent Meeting Decides to Invade Suiyuan on Three Routes <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Jiabusi Temple Communication: Since the National Army recovered Bailing Temple, the military prestige has greatly increased, and the morale is strong. On the bandit puppet side, a major lair has indeed been lost, giving a major blow to their rebellion plan. Recently, the National Army will launch a large-scale suppression, making a thorough sweep, and making a plan for once and for all. The news spread to Chahar North, and the rebel staff members in various counties mostly fled one after another. The military leaders who followed the rebellion, although extremely obedient to a certain party on the surface, are actually very afraid in their hearts. The decisive figures such as Su Meilong and Su Yutian. and others, without waiting for the denunciation of the National Army, imitated the revolt of Muye, washed their hearts and faces, and raised the flag to return to righteousness. The internal collapse and separation are already formed. Now that a certain party is also aware of the disadvantage of this situation for a long time, it is actively pushing its formal army and the newly trained recruits in Jehol westward, as the main force for invading Suiyuan in the future. On the first day of this month, the military pay for the bandit puppet Mongol-Jehol armies was issued at Jiabusi Temple, deciding to launch the third general offensive towards Suiyuan without waiting for the National Army's suppression. At the moment, it is the eve of the continued dramatic battle. The preparation of the bandit puppets and the current situation in Chahar North are detailed below.</p>
<p>Important Meeting at Huade</p>
<p>On the 22nd of last month, De Wang led his confidants and entourage away from Bailing Temple to other places. On the 24th, the National Army captured Bailing Temple. On the 25th, it was learned that De Wang was recuperating in Xisuminte Banner. On the morning of that day, three key figures from a certain force and more than ten Mongol and Han traitors went to the banner to visit De Wang's condition and make contact. On the evening of the 29th, the key figures of a certain party returned to Huade (ie, Jiabusi Temple) from Xisuminte Banner. That night, the councillor of a certain party, the commander of a certain party in the bandit puppet armies, and the key figures of a certain party who returned from Xisuminte Banner and Mongol and Han traitors all held an urgent secret meeting at Jiabusi Temple. It was learned that the only important thing was to re-launch the invasion of Suiyuan and the transfer and deployment of troops in the rear of Chahar North.</p>
<p>Decision to Use Chemical Warfare Weapons</p>
<p>Regarding the invasion plan of Suiyuan, it was decided that (1) Counterattack Bailing Temple, designating the puppet army's 2nd Division and 5th Division, and the Mongolian security stationed in Shangdu , and Wang Jingxiu's Jehol bandit army to form a road to take on the task of counterattacking Bailing Temple, (2) Re-invade Honggeertu, by the bandit army currently stationed in the northwest reclamation area, Tuola Wusu and other villages, and the bandit army currently stationed in Shangdu (including Wang Ying and others) to form a road to take on the task of re-attacking Honggeertu, a subordinate of Taolin, (3) Actively re-invade Xinghe, by the puppet army's 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 3rd Divisions stationed in Nanhouchuan, and Wang Ying's Zhang Wanqing's two infantry brigades to take on the task of capturing Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan. Each road is supplemented by aircraft and other weapons and a certain number of chemical warfare weapons. It is planned to issue 20 aircraft, 15 tanks, and a certain number of chemical machinery to those who counterattack Bailing Temple, 10 aircraft, a total of 12 tanks and armored vehicles, and a certain number of chemical weapons to those who invade Honggeertu, a subordinate of Taolin, and it is not clear how many will be given to those who invade Xinghe.</p>
<p>Establishing a Supervisory Team, Death for Those Who Retreat</p>
<p>In addition, because a certain party is aware of the bandit puppet army's ineffective attacks and repeated defeats by the Suiyuan army, they have carefully planned this re-invasion of the west in advance. A special supervisory team is organized by its own formal army. As for the position of team leader, it has been decided to be filled by a certain person of a certain party who is currently the captain of the puppet Jing'an Army. An order has been issued to all bandit puppet Mongol-Jehol combat troops that anyone who looks back or retreats during combat will be executed by the supervisory team. The means of using Chinese to control Chinese can be described as extremely cruel. A certain number of Wu Fang military officers are dispatched to each road to assist the rebel army, and Zu Ren is in charge of commanding the offensive strategy. More military school students are sent to guide the use of chemical warfare weapons, to guide the release of chemical machinery and poisonous gas at any time, which is truly inhuman.</p>
<p>Issuing Military Pay, Scheduled General Offensive</p>
<p>On the first day of this month, the military pay for the bandit puppet Mongol-Jehol armies was issued by key members of a certain party at Jiabusi Temple, totaling more than 70 million yuan. Because the counterattack is imminent, this tempting means is used. Since Shuri, each army has purchased food in its respective locations, and the supply of each business is in great demand. According to news from insiders of the bandit puppets, it is said that the third general offensive will be launched on the Suiyuan border before the 10th of this month. The war period is already approaching, and it is expected that the future war will be more tragic than in the past. According to a person from Shangdu, a certain party sent 140 traitors on the first day, all of whom disguised themselves and set off, secretly going to Suiyuan East, Taolin, Xinghe, and other places, secretly carrying out activities, trying to destroy a certain most important and most solid project in Suiyuan East, and to destroy the transportation projects such as power lines during the outbreak of the war. The Suiyuan army has received the news and is strictly guarding against it.</p>
<p>De Wang Goes West Again as a Puppet</p>
<p>Now that De Wang, who is recuperating in Xisuminte Banner, has been quite depressed since Bailing Temple was lost and recovered by the Suiyuan army, he has been surrounded and encouraged by those who are willing to follow the rebellion. In addition, a certain party has repeatedly sent people to visit him and used means such as inducement and intimidation. Recently, it has been heard that De Wang really has no way to get rid of the current environment, and has decided to lead his troops westward in the shortest possible time, re-establish the banner, and become a puppet again. His personality is becoming more and more depraved and unrecoverable. According to the bandit puppets and residents in various places in Chahar North, the National Army will go out of Zhangjiakou to intercept the rear route, and they are extremely afraid of the降臨 of the war. The bandit puppets are full of anxiety. Currently, the head of a certain special agency in Jiabusi Temple has secretly sent more than ten agents to Zhangjiakou to investigate.</p>

Moreover, under the harsh rule of the Japanese puppet regime, the disaster-stricken people are crying out for food, and resentment is brewing. This is indeed a major hidden danger for the Japanese puppet regime. The details of the heavy snowstorm disasters in various parts of Northeast China are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegraph and Telephone Lines Severed</p>
<p>Within the Guandong Leased Territory, except for the telephone service within Lushun city, all submarine cables, communication facilities, etc., between Dalian and Sasebo, and between Dalian and Changchun, have been completely cut off. In addition, wireless communications are also disrupted because the control line between the Liushutun relay station and the Dalian Central Telegraph Bureau is completely destroyed, resulting in a complete breakdown of communication. Telegraph and telephone lines from Dalian to the entire Northeast region are also completely out of service.</p>
<p>Trains on Various Lines Delayed</p>
<p>Due to the damage caused by the heavy snow, the situation on various railway lines in the Northeast is severely affected. (1) The downward bound No. 15 express train on the Lianjing Line (from Dalian to Changchun) was delayed and stopped at Pulandian, unable to depart. The downward bound Nos. 19 and 23 trains collided, resulting in several passenger deaths and injuries. (2) The upward bound train on the Anfeng Line (from Andong to Shenyang) stopped at Sujiatun. There are many other disaster situations on various lines that cannot be fully investigated and understood at this time.</p>
<p>Disaster in Dalian Waters</p>
<p>Due to the heavy snowstorm, land and sea transportation connections in the Liaodong Peninsula area belonging to the Dalian coast have been cut off. In addition, a total of 25 ships have been wrecked and sunk, including 4 motorboats, 1 small steamboat, and 20 sailing boats. The total loss in Dalian Bay is estimated to exceed 500,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, and six others were arrested in Shanghai on suspicion of endangering the Republic of China. All parties are paying great attention to this case. Wang Yongbin, Minister of Judicial Administration, specially summoned Sun Chenglin, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, to Beijing the day before yesterday. After receiving instructions in person, he immediately returned to Suzhou and appointed Prosecutor Weng Zhuonian to handle the case. At 5:00 p.m. on the 4th, Shen Junru and the other six were escorted from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to Suzhou and directly to the High Court. Prosecutor Weng took the bench in the Eighth Tribunal and interrogated them separately for about two hours. He then ordered them to be sent to the High Court Detention Center on Heng Street, Wuxian County. At that time, Prosecutor Weng and Prison Officer Hui Hong, leading all the bailiffs, escorted the six prisoners to the detention center. That night, they were held in Wards 3, 4, and 5 of the center's infirmary. These wards were well-lit, spacious, and well-ventilated. There was also a lawn in front where they could take walks at will, which was quite comfortable and accommodating. Ward No. 1 was set aside as a dining room and a place for relatives and friends to visit. However, when relatives and friends visited, Prison Officer Jiang had to report to Prosecutor Weng at any time. Visits were allowed twice a day, in the morning and afternoon. Because Shen Junru has many relatives, friends, and students in Suzhou, there are many people who come to visit him. It is also heard that Prosecutor Weng will conduct on-site interrogation inside the detention center within days.</p>

<p>At 10:04 a.m. on the 29th, our group of seven embarked on the PingSui Railway journey. The Yenching University Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War Relief Association, during a two-day suspension of classes, had students hand-making ten thousand hygiene kits, which were also being transported with us to the front lines.</p>
<p>In the third-class carriage, the passengers were unusually crowded. Everyone was bundled up in thick clothing, and standing on tiptoe in the crowd, they felt a bit sweaty. However, the conductor gave us unexpected preferential treatment, allowing us to move to the first-class carriage. During the 19-hour journey, we did not suffer the hardships we had anticipated. We felt ashamed and uneasy, but the conductor's kindness was deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>At 5:00 a.m. on the 30th, we arrived safely in GuiSui. Stepping onto this glorious land that has attracted worldwide attention, our hearts were filled with excitement and joy. At 9:00 a.m., we visited the provincial government to inform the authorities that the students of the Journalism Department of Yenching University had organized a war zone investigation team to introduce the situation in the war zone, which the people of the country were eagerly awaiting. At the same time, we brought the sincere admiration of eight hundred students for the loyal and brave soldiers who were defending the country here.</p>
<p>The militia in Suiyuan are very well-trained. This is a strong grassroots force, and this strength was bravely demonstrated in the anti-Japanese war in HongGeltu. Soon, we plan to visit the militia training center at Xiaoxiao Field to see what their training content and methods are.</p>
<p>This place is very quiet. The people all have calm faces. People coming from afar would hardly believe that there is an anti-Japanese war going on at the border.</p>
<p>After BaiLing Temple was captured, everyone was talking animatedly, and comfort telegrams and gifts came from all sides, almost overwhelming them. Therefore, a Joint Military-Civilian Association was specially established under the General Command for Bandit Suppression to manage these matters and to receive visiting well-wishers.</p>
<p>We are staying at the Dabeilv Hotel, which was recommended by the Provincial Government's Reception Office. It is said that this hotel used to be exclusively for foreign friends, and the owner was the owner of the famous Matsuda Mansion. Today, the gates of the Matsuda Mansion are tightly closed, locked with an iron chain. Mr. Matsuda, who used to be responsible for consular affairs and regularly transported military supplies to BaiLing Temple, has quietly disappeared. The owner of the Yushan Mansion, which served as a special agency, is still in Suiyuan, but his car no longer dashes and rushes on the streets, crushing small lives on the roadside as casually as stepping on an ant, and then dusting off his sleeves and leaving. Currently, there are only six foreign friends in the entire GuiSui city, but they are all very polite and have lost the kind of boisterous enthusiasm they used to have at the Suiyuan Hotel, such as firing guns for fun after getting drunk.</p>
<p>Today, we sent three students to BaiLing Temple with the Central Photography Team to investigate. Regarding that aspect, we will have a detailed report to present to the people of the whole country, who are rejoicing over this great victory.</p>
<p>In the morning, the four of us who stayed in GuiSui were led by Committee Member Qiao of the Joint Military-Civilian Association to two hospitals of the 35th Army to comfort the wounded soldiers. One place was on Xiaodong Street, where most of the soldiers were wounded in HongGeltu, a total of 58. They were all in good spirits. The lightly wounded only said that they would go to the front lines again as soon as they recovered. The other place was the Fourth Elementary School on Shangshanzi Street, which was considered a primary field hospital, housing 33 wounded soldiers, all of whom had participated in the attack on BaiLing Temple. Here we talked a lot with a Major Medical Officer Yun, who promised that we would come back and talk to the wounded brothers individually after returning from BaiLing Temple.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 120 wounded soldiers in GuiSui, and some are staying in public hospitals. This field hospital was only organized and established on the 11th of last month. The food and daily life of the wounded soldiers are very good. They eat 1.4 catties of foreign flour, 4 liang of millet, and 10 cents of vegetables every day, and they have meat with every meal. The wards have stoves and are very warm, and the bedding is very clean.</p>
<p>The morale in this anti-Japanese war is very high. All the lightly wounded refused to be carried on stretchers and refused to come down. They believed that as long as they had a breath left, they would never want to lose the opportunity to kill the enemy. This burgeoning enthusiasm greatly moved the officers, who all said that this was a situation that had never occurred since the 35th Army began fighting. Naturally, it is impossible to compare a national war with a civil war. How could a civil war make the people of the country excited and give them enthusiastic material and spiritual assistance?</p>
<p>Because of this loyal and brave anti-Japanese war, we have an even stronger belief in the future of the revival of the Chinese nation. (Meng Jue, sent from GuiSui, December 1)</p>

<p>The winter defense of this county has already begun. Military police inspect the hotels in the city and suburbs every night. On the fourth night, the military police of the Second Garrison found two suspicious men and women in the Heiyu Dafang Hotel. The man spoke with a Nantong accent and claimed to be Zhang Jinkui, an intelligence officer from the Fengxian Public Security Bureau. A symbol, a pistol, and nine bullets were found on him. When asked if he had official documents to come to Songjiang and the serial number of the pistol and the number of bullets, he was unable to answer. The woman, Sheng Yuefang, was 19 years old and said she was his mistress. The police considered them to be very suspicious and took them to the police station for interrogation.</p>

<p>Robbery Case at Yuantong Nunnery Solved</p>
<p>The Yuantong Nunnery in the Fifth District of Wu County was robbed on the night of the 29th of last month. After Zhiwen, the abbess of the nunnery, escaped, she saw two robbers, Zhang Jinkun and Zhang Shanrong, whom she knew well, on a bright moonlit night. Afterwards, she immediately reported to the county government for their arrest. County Chief Hou immediately dispatched Detective Chen Sendu of the Detective Team to investigate and handle the matter. Chen and others went to the countryside early in the morning on the 3rd of this month and arrested Zhang Yukun and the other two. They did not admit the robbery. It was later found out that Zhang Shanrong's father, Zhang Churong, had colluded with the already executed bandit Yu Jinxi to rob the houses of Shan Yan Liu Chanlin and others in the Third District in January of the 23rd year. He had been wanted ever since. Detective Chen immediately took the two criminals to the city and handed them over to the county for interrogation in April.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Yarn Flower: Reported Warehouse Yarn Stocks Only 500 Bales; Auction Yarn Sets New Price; Recently Auctioned at 268 Yuan; Spot Yarn Sales Rise Again by About 4 Yuan; Ewo Yarn Sold at 253 Yuan <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to advance, with a very strong momentum, mainly because of the lack of spot yarn, which causes panic among short sellers. The current selling price of Jincheng spot yarn has reached 280 yuan. It is said that the yarn stock in the yarn and cloth warehouse is only 500 bales, resulting in a new price for the January-February term yarn of 268 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that Ewo Factory released 800 bales of 20-count Five Blessings/Shepherd yarn at a price of 253 yuan. It was also said that the Qingdao Yarn Factory had news of resuming production. As a result, the short sellers covered their positions, and Changfeng also shipped out a large number of cases, so the market turned from high to flat.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Becomes Even Tighter Recently</p>
<p>At the opening of the auction yarn market, prices rose across the board because spot yarn is extremely tight and the yarn stock in the warehouse is decreasing day by day, reportedly with only 500 bales remaining. As a result, short sellers were even more panicked, and new entrants were all wary. The market rose step by step. Near-month contracts jumped by 3 yuan at the third session, and the December term reached a new price of 268 yuan. The January term also reached 56 yuan. All terms rose above the new high price of the second day. Subsequently, Changfeng shipped a large number of cases at the third session, and the counter eased until the close of trading, and the market fell back. As a result, each term rose by 1.5 to 2.5 yuan compared with the close of the previous day. At the opening in the afternoon, it was heard that the spot yarn situation was still tight, and prices rose again by 2 yuan to 2.8 yuan, with the July term rising by 79 corners. Near-month contracts were still firm in the second session, while far-month contracts fell by 5 corners to 1.1 yuan. Until the third close of trading, the market slackened slightly due to the selling pressure from long sellers, with the current month falling back by 2.5 yuan and the far month falling by 67 corners. As a result, each term compared with the morning close of trading, with the January term rising by 3 corners and the far month falling by 4.9 corners. The sales were: Changchangfeng 11,800 bales, Ruidai 1,350 bales, Chengji 2,150 bales, Gengfeng 5,750 bales, Senkang 3,350 bales, Changyu 1,000 bales, Dachangcheng 1,650 bales, Taichang 2,200 bales, Yichang 1,150 bales, Tonghe 1,200 bales, Xincheng 2,200 bales, Runkang 2,950 bales.

<p>Cotton prices rose slightly because the yarn market is doing well and rising step by step, and people are excited. Also, some cotton merchants are going long recently, slightly pulling up the price. However, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets are flat and lackluster, and the prices are too high, so the factory demand is not strong. But it is said that the Qingdao Yarn Factory has news of resuming production.</p>
<p>Auction Cotton Purely Driven Up by Term Yarn</p>
<p>At the opening of the auction cotton market, the prices rose uniformly, mainly because the yarn market is constantly reaching new peaks, and people are being carried away by it. Recently, some people who buy yarn and sell cotton have hedged their positions, buying back cotton and selling yarn. Therefore, the cotton market has been driven up, but new long positions are still rare. As a result, the prices of each term of auction cotton rose by 3.5 to 6.5 corners compared with the closing price of the previous day. The overseas cotton market is still bleak and weak. At the opening in the afternoon, it was reported that the Qingdao Yarn Factory had news of resuming production, and the yarn market was still firm, trending up by 1.5 to 2 corners. After the first session, it was heard that spot cotton trading was not smooth, and it fell into a state of fatigue again. As a result, the prices of each term fell by 5 minutes to 1.5 corners compared with the morning closing price. The sales were: Hexing 12,700 dan, Yudai 2,900 dan, Juxing 3,700 dan, Dafeng 3,300 dan, Gengfeng 5,500 dan, Changyu 1,100 dan, Wang Taixing 2,200 dan, Dachangcheng 9,600 dan, Taichang 6,000 dan, Yichang 3,700 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan.

<p>American cotton opened yesterday with mixed prices, with small fluctuations. The prices of each month rose by 2 pound tones. Early in the morning, the market was slightly weak due to the release of 15 delivery notices, the liquidation of long positions in the December term, and short selling. Traders were the only buyers. Although the government report this month did not have any important changes, traders are still waiting. The mood in the market is biased towards the buying side due to rising prices of various commodities and firm spot prices. However, due to the instability of the political situation abroad, buyers cannot help but be wary when the price is above 2 minutes of an angle. At the close of trading, the market was slightly weak due to the liquidation of long positions. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose by 1 pound tone to falling by 8 pound tones. English cotton spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose by 12 points. Indian cotton was weak at first due to the liquidation of long positions by retail investors, and then recovered due to short covering, but then softened again due to short selling. The price of Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupee, and the prices of Aomula fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupee, while Bairuoxi was unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th Electricity).</p>

<h3 id="e75">Special Feature Reply to the Inquiry from the Economic Research Institute of Nankai University <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Our institute plans to continue producing transaction indices for important Chinese commodities, and urgently needs your newspaper to publish market prices and transaction volumes of silk and tea to serve as references. However, we do not know the source of this data and the unit conversion methods (e.g., how many catties equal one case), whether it is futures or spot goods. We respectfully request your guidance and will be immensely grateful. This matter concerns academic research, and we hope for your favorable consideration. Please promptly investigate and reply. With utmost respect, initiated by the Economic Research Institute of Nankai University, Tianjin Private University (1st)</p>
<p>Regarding your inquiries, we have forwarded your letter to the Tea Firms Guild and silk investigators in this city. We now have the following responses:</p>
<p>The Tea Firms Guild stated in their letter: "Upon investigation, the weight of tea cases cannot be uniformly determined. Cases vary in size, and tea leaves also vary in weight. However, on average, each case weighs approximately fifty catties. If Nankai University desires detailed quantities, please inform them that they can directly inquire with our guild, and we will be happy to answer."</p>
<p>The silk investigators stated in their letter: "Raw silk is measured in bales, and there are no strict regulations regarding its weight. However, generally, it is around one dan (approximately 100 catties). (Some are less than 100 catties, while others exceed 100 catties, but the difference is not significant.) However, market prices are quoted per 100 catties of raw silk. Furthermore, all statistical figures for raw silk bales are also around one dan in weight, without precise catty figures."</p>
<p>In summary, although the above silk and tea are not for immediate delivery, they are of a spot nature. Moreover, our newspaper publishes monthly export inspection reports from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, which include quantities in kilograms that are accurate and reliable and can assist academic research. This is for your information. No further correspondence will be sent. The Editor (5th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was generally very firm for all months. Because the domestic wheat market had already fallen, if people want to calm down, they must make firm orders for foreign wheat, no matter what. Only then can general speculators let go. Therefore, although there were few transactions in the morning, the market still rose by 2.4.5 points. When the market opened in the afternoon, buying interest was strong again, and all months continued to rise by 3.5 points. The furthest term, such as April, reached a high of $7.02. Later, due to rumors of orders for foreign wheat, the market saw a pullback, falling by 35 points from the initial price. Currently, the wheat market is not active due to low arrivals. Customers are very concerned about the goods stored in Shanghai, and all factories are sticking to their supplies.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market rose uniformly again. Foreign wheat prices were slightly up by a dime in Chicago, up by four cents in Canada, and Liverpool rebounded by 12 pence. Therefore, when prices were set at the customs gate, outside buyers felt that foreign wheat was not suitable for ordering, and their courage seemed to grow stronger. On the domestic front, there are few statistics on the amount of wheat in storage, so general speculators were able to raise prices at will. Compared to the previous day, prices rose by 3.4.5 points for the near term and 1.2 points for the far term. When the market opened in the afternoon, outside bulls bought in large quantities again, and the prices for this month and January both rose by about 2 points. Transactions for February and beyond were also very active. However, some speculators also sold off in large quantities, and rumors of orders for foreign wheat led to a gradual stabilization of the market, falling back by 2.3 points from the highest price. As a result, the near term rose by 3.4 points, while March and April had minor fluctuations of half a point.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Hakka Xian rice market was lackluster. However, inventories in the market gradually increased, and merchants were mostly showing samples to sell, so the market appeared soft and lifeless. But yesterday, the local street demand was still active, and some outside hoarders also stepped in. The Henan and Shantou gangs each took several hundred bags, so market prices remained stable. Only the Guangdong gang has suspended operations for days, and the merchants' minds are inevitably shaken. Therefore, while Fenmai and Hebei rice, as well as soybean oil and miscellaneous grains, are soaring, Hakka Xian has failed to rise. Throughout the day, more than 3,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,320 bags of Hunan rice, 500 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 320 bags of Wenzhou rice were offered, with the prices similar to the previous market, and most of it was handled by local merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e81">River Rice Market Still Feels Stable <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were similar to the previous day, with more than 80 firms still arriving, totaling more than 16,000 stones of goods. Among them, Bo Dao accounted for more than 50 firms. The local street sales were still acceptable. The Xunwei, Pingqingyan and other gangs handled more than 6,000 bags of Bo Dao and 1,4500 bags of Hou Geng. Therefore, although the prices of Hou Geng and Bo Geng have not seen much rise or fall, they have presented a situation of "tight on the surface, tight underneath". Du Yangjian is similar, with Yin Yuan stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were no arrivals from the west section of the Suzhou River, only two or three firms coming through the roundabout. Since the rice boats detained by Jiading County, the boats stored on the river have been scarce. Although the market is weak, customers are quite firm. Therefore, the price of Bai Geng was stable in the early market and turned tighter by several points in the afternoon. The price of Yangjian rose by 45 points, and the prices of Budu and Kejian also showed improvement. The price of early rice followed closely, while the price of Bo Dao was peaceful, and Yin Biang Yuan had no rise or fall. It is expected that the prices of other goods will rise in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Silk and Tea: American Firms Sell 100 Bales of Silk <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the overseas silk market has weakened. Yesterday, both Japan and the United States saw a slight rebound. New York standard silk futures each rose by 3.5 points. Japanese silk 83 and 75 saw a modest rebound of 2 points on average. However, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk continued to fall by 2 points each in the United States. Yokohama spot prices fell by 5 yen, while futures rose by 8 yen. Lyon Shanghai silk AB grades both opened at the original price. Japanese silk and Guangdong silk each fell by one franc. The Shanghai silk market is still quite sluggish. American firms are selling silk, and Indian firms are still busy with sporadic transactions. Although the number is not large, the business situation this week is considered good. Domestic silk still shows no improvement, with only occasional transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise; Qingdao Goods Disappear Due to Strike; Fine Cloth and Fine Twill Rise Another 10-20 Cents <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still affected by the Qingdao strike, with no arrivals. The northern route had a large demand, which made the market even stronger. Raw materials and yarn, which are closely related, are seeing new high prices every day, and the rising tide lifts all boats, causing cotton cloth to rise even faster, initially unaffected by actual sales. Fine twill and fine cloth from Qingdao are usually plentiful, so yesterday the market rose another 10 to 20 cents. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, and flannel prices were all stable. Single-yarn woven goods such as Zhigong and serge, as well as flannel, are seeing prices for 42-count yarn soar to nearly 400 yuan, so each factory's supplies continue to increase by 1.5 to 1 cent per yard. Other non-seasonal goods such as poplin and bleached cloth from distant Guangdong, Sichuan, and Hunan were searched for and purchased in nearly 100 pieces, all of which were leftover goods from this year, and the selling prices are gradually increasing. There are still several batches under negotiation. Customer demand varies in urgency. Most believe that the price increase is too steep and the base is too high, fearing a backlash, so they are hesitant to act. In recent days, shipments have been scarce, and goods from the important cloth-producing areas of Wuxi and Changzhou have been cut off for three days due to poor waterway conditions, making the market feel even more lacking in spot goods.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Ordinary Colored Zhigong Woolen Fabric is Out of Stock <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yuanqing (dark blue) Zhigong woolen fabric is in short supply because previous orders were mostly unprofitable, leading to a lack of orders. Now, it is in timely demand for both men's and women's leather overcoats and formal wear. Old stocks have been sold out. Although buyers have replaced it with Yuanqing Zhigong, most of its long-term customers still need plain-colored Zhigong, so stores have had to search for supplies. The market has therefore strengthened again, and selling prices have continued to rise. Many woolen fabric merchants are now hoarding goods, and the selling prices in the morning and afternoon often differ. Common seven-yuan light-finish goods are indeed scarce. Good goods above ten yuan are not seen lacking in the market.</p>

<h3 id="e89">The Important Key to Curing Lung Disease <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>1.  Have patience and courage for recuperation! 2. Use medication appropriately, do not recklessly use anything!</p>
<p>Lung disease is a stubborn and difficult-to-treat illness. It cannot be cured with recuperation for a day or two. One must be away from society for a long time, concentrate on recuperation, and can achieve full success. Therefore, if you want to defeat lung disease and cure it, patients must have a spirit of fearlessness, cultivate courage and patience for a long period. This is indeed an important key to curing lung disease. Most people who die of lung disease do not die from the disease itself, but from unnecessarily worrying for a long time, being in a state of mental and physical distress, and thus dying in anger.</p>
<p>Lung disease requires long-term treatment, so one cannot help but think of active society and of healthy people. And curse the world, envy others, thinking that everyone is healthy, and that they alone have contracted lung disease, and the heart is restless. Although this is a common phenomenon of injustice and dissatisfaction among patients, this injustice and dissatisfaction can indeed hinder the peace of mind and promote severe neurasthenia, so they cannot sleep at night, their appetite decreases, and various obstacles continue. Not only does it make the disease difficult to heal quickly, but it also inevitably worsens the disease. Therefore, the first step in treating lung disease should be to have a broad view of everything, transcend the environment, and cultivate the mind, which is the most urgent task.</p>
<p>If patients have perseverance and the courage to persevere and engage in recuperation, they can also increase the body's internal physiological defenses (that is, resistance) and initiate the body’s natural healing function. As a result, the progressive nature of the diseased part can be changed to a static one, the heat decreases, the sputum cough decreases, and naturally the vitality is strong and the spirit is refreshed. There can be infinite hope for healing.</p>
<p>People with tuberculosis are often fearful and worried, trembling as if the end of the world is coming. In fact, active treatment at the appropriate time can be expected to cure the disease completely. It is a pity that most patients are ignorant of medical knowledge. At first, they may not notice it and let it go untreated, or they may use inappropriate medication and go astray, eventually leading to incurable conditions. This is a sigh. In terms of today's medical progress, there are effective treatments for lung disease. According to various lung sanatoriums, the newly released "Fei Huo" Phith Wael drug from Germany is effective in treating tuberculosis (pulmonary tuberculosis) in stages one, two and three. If patients take it according to the method and pay attention to hygiene, perseverance and determination, and engage in long-term recuperation, they can achieve a recovery rate of up to 95%. Therefore, I sincerely advise fellow sufferers of lung disease not to panic and worry, and seek their own doom. They should strive for this appropriate treatment and re-enjoy health and happiness, which is certainly not difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Worthy of Our Attention: A Report on the Radical Cure of Asthma <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— By Dr. G. Courtenary, M.D., Translated by Physician Fangshi</p>
<p>The Clinical Trial Results of the Newly Invented German "Xiaoliping" for Asthma Treatment</p>
<p>In the past, due to the lack of perfect medicines, asthma was considered an incurable disease. Even we clinical physicians felt it was a thorny problem. We could only temporarily alleviate the suffering during an attack with anesthetics (morphine, opium). To cure it completely and prevent recurrence was difficult and hopeless. However, such anesthetics should not be used frequently, lest they cause addiction. Asthma medicines sold in the market often contain anesthetics, which can be effective immediately. But if they are used every time an attack occurs, they can easily lead to addiction. If patients take such asthma medicines containing toxic substances, not only will they not be cured, but they can also suffer serious poisoning. One must be careful.</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Humbert, M.D., based on years of experience and the latest scientific principles, has invented an asthma radical cure called "Xiaoliping" (Hollpin). It is an oral tablet that does not contain any addictive substances. Although it has great efficacy, it has no side effects. It specifically treats all kinds of asthma in the elderly and children, breathing difficulties, and other symptoms. It has been recommended and used by physicians around the world. In recent years, I have treated no fewer than a hundred cases of asthma, all of whom were given "Xiaoliping" (Holipin) and were able to achieve a radical cure, reaching as high as 95%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dr. Becker, an asthma expert at the Italian WIETELMNNE SANATORIUM (Weiheming Sanatorium), reported that from July 1935 to April 1936, 159 asthma patients were diagnosed. Among them, 81 had been suffering from the disease for more than ten years and had frequent attacks. Their symptoms were more severe than others. They had previously undergone various injection or medication treatments without permanent relief. After the sanatorium administered "Xiaoliping" (Hoipin), an internal secretion therapy, orally, 76 out of these 81 severely ill patients were completely cured within four months. To date, there have been no reports of recurrence, which shows that it is indeed a complete cure. The other five patients died due to severe heart disease that could not be saved. All the patients outside of these 81 had only been ill for a short time (so-called mild cases). They were completely cured after taking "Xiaoliping" (Holipin) for only two to three months. Many patients came for treatment when they were having an attack. After taking "Xiaoliping" orally, asthma was relieved within ten minutes. Distress and shortness of breath were immediately resolved. After taking this medicine for a considerable period after an attack, all were cured completely. As for the nature of this medicine, it is mild and non-toxic. Patients can treat themselves. It is suitable for both the elderly and children, and there are no drawbacks. This is even more praised by doctors around the world.</p>

<p>Maintaining Healthy Menstruation—The Source of Family Harmony!</p>
<p>A Woman's Health and Beauty—The Obvious Sign is Menstruation. If menstruation comes regularly and recurs on time, it is likely that the sexual function is not in any abnormal state. At the same time, it can be seen that there are no other changes. Of course, it is healthy, beautiful and lively.</p>
<p>Normal menstruation indicates the soundness of a woman's body. If menstruation is irregular, it indicates a woman's physical weakness. Therefore, menstruation is a measure of a woman's health. I often see young women who are pale, depressed, and weak. After examination and inquiry, nine out of ten are caused by abnormal menstruation.</p>
<p>The symptoms of menstrual disorders are generally pain before and after menstruation. Menstruation is either excessive or insufficient. The menstrual cycle is irregular, either several times a month or once every few months. The lower abdomen and waist often feel distended and painful. There is a loss of blood and qi, accompanied by various symptoms of neurasthenia, such as headache, insomnia, stiff shoulders, palpitations, poor appetite, nausea, constipation, excessive urination, dizziness, fatigue, numbness, edema, general fatigue, loss of libido, and anorgasmia. The severity of these symptoms can be known from the patients' own descriptions, and there are indeed many.</p>
<p>The miserable state of young women suffering from menstrual diseases is truly indescribable. It destroys the beautiful dreams of couples and causes discord in the family. Because of mental distress, the happiness of youth, health and beauty is completely consumed in the pain of menstruation. What a pity. Therefore, menstrual disorders must be treated appropriately as soon as possible, and attention must be paid to health maintenance. Never underestimate or ignore them.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, the most effective medicine for treating menstrual disorders at home is "Meinu Ning" (M,norrin). This medicine is effective for gynecological diseases such as menstrual disorders! Leukorrhea. Hysteria (i.e., neurasthenia in women). Taking "Meinu Ning" (M,norrin) can promote the development of female sexual organs, regulate menstruation, satisfy sexual desire, promote metabolism, remove blood stasis, generate new blood, strengthen the body, and prevent the aging of women. Those who have been married for a long time without pregnancy can use it to regulate menstruation and conceive. It is always effective. It has been proven by many doctors that it is the source of women's health.</p>
<p>Attention Youth</p>
<h3 id="e92">Eradicate Neurasthenia— <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— By Dr. Hydon, Translated by Dr. Lu Fangxian</p>
<p>The Prerequisite for Your Career to Achieve Great Success!</p>
<p>We should engage in work as mentally and physically strong individuals. Then work is a pleasure for us, not a pain. And we are proactive in our work, not passive. Otherwise, everything we do will carry the mark of weakness. And in the midst of weakness, success is impossible. A person with low vitality, mental weakness, psychological instability, and uncertain steps will naturally never accomplish anything great. Everywhere we can see many young people, due to physical and mental weakness, lamenting the sorrow of unfulfilled aspirations! And wasting their mediocre lives!</p>
<p>The causes of weakness in general young people are very complex. Generally, congenital weakness is more common in people with nervousness and glandular disorders (the so-called congenital deficiency). Acquired weakness, for example, is caused by wasting diseases (tuberculosis), poor hygiene, etc. Apart from the various causes mentioned above, masturbation or excessive sexual activity is a most common and greatest cause contributing to weakness in young people!</p>
<p>Our spirit and overall vitality are produced by the brain. Therefore, scholars say that the brain is the master of the human body, because the brain is the source of the nervous system. If the body is weak, then the entire nervous tissue naturally exhibits a state of decline, such as a dizzy head, trance, headache, insomnia, dreams, spermatorrhea, palpitations, tinnitus, vision problems, slow thinking, memory loss, laziness in work, digestive disorders, back pain, pale skin, and haggard appearance. These are all symptoms of neurasthenia. There are also simultaneous occurrences of sexual dysfunction - nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, etc. This not only eliminates the joys of youth, but also has a great impact on the happiness of marriage and family—If you want to have great aspirations in life, you must cultivate outstanding energy—and strive to remove the "neurasthenia" that is destroying your vitality in the dark—To cure weakness and cultivate strong energy, you should abide by the general conditions of health maintenance.</p>
<p>Regularly take "Mimeier Brain-Boosting Sweat" (MEMORY NEUROTIC) to nourish the withered nerve cells throughout your body. Increase the blood, the source of your life. So that you may gain new vitality, as if strength could be shot out from your pores. Therefore. It can indeed eliminate various diseases and maintain the highest degree of physical and mental health! And enable you to have better and faster progress in your career!</p>
<h3 id="e93">Married Men and Women Should Pay Attention to the Issue of Having Children! <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Huang Yale</p>
<p>Procreation is a natural instinct. Having children is a natural result. Nowadays, the phenomenon of infertility after a long marriage has become the only major problem for married men and women. If it is not resolved, it will not only affect the unhappiness between husband and wife and in the family, but also the future of society and the country.</p>
<p>The source of offspring lies in reproductive function. This is known to everyone. If the reproductive function declines or there is a lack of internal secretions, sexual diseases between husband and wife will arise frequently. Men often suffer from spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, and decreased energy. Women often suffer from menstrual disorders, persistent leukorrhea, breast atrophy, uterine cold, and abdominal pain. If one party is ill, there is no hope of having children. Since the source of the disease lies in the reproductive organs' impaired function—that is, the reduction of internal secretions—the fundamental treatment is to supplement internal secretions—to invigorate the reproductive organs' function—to restore them to health.</p>
<p>According to the experiments of sexual disease experts in various countries, taking "Fulang Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" (Fonan Tab) is the most effective for male spermatorrhea and nocturnal emissions. As for the issue of nourishing the kidneys and strengthening essence, it must be emphasized at the same time in order to fundamentally resolve it. This kind of kidney-nourishing and essence-strengthening agent, only the testicular gland internal secretion product "Huan'ertong" (Well Tonic) has the natural, sensitive, yin-nourishing, deficiency-tonifying—root-nurturing and yuan-strengthening effect.</p>
<p>Women should take "Meinu Ning" (Menorrin). This medicine can regulate menstruation, activate blood circulation, nourish menstrual blood, strengthen the uterus, promote its reproductive function, invigorate its secretions, and enable women to have healthy functions, vigorous qi and blood. Youthful health and beauty. More lively and lovely.</p>
<p>If both men and women can follow the above methods, they will undoubtedly have a son and live a happy married life without any cracks in their love.</p>

<p>Men Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Men Zhizhong, member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and chairman of the Construction Committee, came south to pay tribute to Duan Qirui on the order of Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. He arrived in Shanghai by Shanghai-Ping through train at 7:50 a.m. yesterday and stayed at the Dadong Hotel. Then, at about 2:30 p.m., he went to Duan's residence on Avenue Joffre with Li Guanghan, Song Zheyuan's representative in Shanghai, to pay tribute. According to Men, the situation in Suiyuan is tense, but the situation in Peiping and Tianjin is still peaceful. Chairman Song is determined to protect the territory completely.

<p>Family Ceremony in the Morning</p>
<p>The family ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. First, the son in mourning attire inscribed the tablet, followed by the family ceremony, and finally the guests and funeral committee members paid their respects.</p>
<p>Public Tribute in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the funeral committee members held a public tribute, presided over by Gong Xinzhan. Because most of the funeral committee members were former subordinates, they performed the kneeling ceremony. In addition, those who went to pay tribute yesterday included Men Zhizhong and Li Guanghan, representatives of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Jiao Yitang, President of the Supreme Court, Xiang Hanping, representative of Guangdong Pacification Director Yu Hanmou, Deng Gang, representative of Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Huang Musong, Zhang Fang, member of the Henan Provincial Government, Zhang Yilin, representative of the Jiangsu Fellow Villagers Association, Han Guojun, and Jin Yunpeng, Tang Xiangming, Chen Shufan, Chen Jintao, Xu Jingtang, (Deng Gang) Huang Yanpei, Zhang Yipeng, Master Taixu, and many others.</p>
<p>Gong's Memorial Oration</p>
<p>The memorial oration of the funeral committee members said, "On December 5, 25th year of the Republic of China, Xinzhan, Tiaoyuan, etc., respectfully present clear wine and various delicacies to the spirit of Executive Duan Gong, saying, 'Alas, my lord, the fate of the country is tied to you. When the fate of the country frequently declined, you were the only one who could rectify it. In the late Qing Dynasty, the army was weak and the scholars were depraved. You rose up to revive them, easily changing what was heard and seen. Driving the steeds, whipping the wind and thunder, the fortifications were new, and the sound shook the earth. In Jijiang, you lectured on martial arts, and your intelligence was shared, and all the talents strove to learn, like gold leaping into the forge. You stationed your troops in Yan and Qi, and the soldiers were pleased and the people cherished you. You led the border region, and you were a majestic town in Jianghuai. During the Revolution of 1911, the righteous army rose up, and you pitied the people's hardship and approved the national shame. The consensus was not followed, and the north and south fought against each other. With one declaration, the foundation of the nation was created. You dispelled the chaos and made arrangements properly, expanding the framework and rescuing the people from the fire and water. After deliberating on the change of system, evil thoughts manifested themselves, daring to destroy our room, and still causing obstacles. You fought to the death, opening the door to the dark, relying on justice to maintain the foundation of the country. You held the scales, hoping to express what you had accumulated. The wind and clouds were frightening and chaotic, and Europe was muddy. You made a unique decision, with a broad view and distant hope, supporting justice and attacking violence. The heavenly spear was raised and wielded. When the matter was in full swing, the crowd suspected and slandered you. Finally, you extended the national prestige, running alongside Britain and the United States. The country had many difficulties, and the tyrants indulged themselves. Suddenly, the Han flag was pulled out, and my divine weapon was stolen. You vowed to lead an army, and the Ma Chang campaign was fought at night. The sound of thunder and the comet swept away, and the universe was clear again. For thousands of miles in Mongolia, the tribute was not offered. The control and subjugation were transformed, and the profound plan moved like thunder. These grand plans, the great ones, were clear. Virtue was pleasing to the people, and merit was in the world. You were humble and did not boast, and Taibo yielded three times. The deaf were uniquely discerning, who could spy on your elegant demeanor? The blind and ignorant must ruin their achievements. When you came, the country was righteous, and when you left, the country was falling. Putting the ruler like a game of chess, who will revive the discipline? The second rise was empty and changed, cutting us off. The grand plan was not yet completed, and who cares about the lonely heart? Hao Ran flew far away, following the traces of Ji Ying. When you first took office, the crowd suspected and did not follow you. When you left, they thought together. Late at night, lying in Cangjiang, you were hidden like an enemy country, and the border guards were in turmoil. The sickbed was always sad. Your merits and achievements will shine forever. Your old plans were heroic and strategic, and you used them a hundred times. Only your loyalty, firm, steadfast, and undivided, your great spirit and red heart, sprayed out stars and sun. You should have reached the age of seventy or eighty, protecting the mountains and rivers. You robbed me of an elder statesman. What is the sky saying? The court and the public were shocked and grieved, and hundreds of millions of people wept like rain. The world has lost a teacher, and who will stand with us? Especially we, the confidants, are grateful, and we have been treated with kindness, often close to smiles and words, and we have followed you through hardships, and we have been nurtured in the Jianghu. Once the beam is broken, the cover is feared. The depressions are hidden, and the Huai River is desolate. This man is dead, where can we go? The sea is rising, and there are many fortresses in the four suburbs. The Huabiao has been around for thousands of years, where will the spirit settle? Although the road is separated by clouds, the heroic spirit will not die. I hope that it will descend to the extreme and bless our people. Alas, enjoy it."</p>
<p>Zhao Comes to Meet the Coffin</p>
<p>Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau and Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee, is currently preparing to transport Duan's coffin north on the 7th of this month. Chen is unable to personally meet and greet him due to the busy railway affairs. In addition to ordering the responsible officials of the Beining Railway to take care of the coffin when it is transported from Tianjin to Ping, he also specially sent Zhao Weiru, Director of the Beijing Office of the Railway, to Shanghai to respectfully meet and greet him. Zhao arrived in Shanghai yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. He immediately went to Duan's residence to pay tribute and discussed the transportation of the coffin with the funeral committee.</p>

<p>Ninety Gold Units or More. Customs Announced This Yesterday</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs, in order to comply with the order to revise the minimum cargo value for cargo manifests not requiring consular certification to ninety gold units, issued Notice No. 1554, stating that: It has been investigated that the minimum cargo value for cargo manifests not requiring consular certification was previously one hundred national currency units, which has now been revised to the equivalent of ninety customs gold units, as announced by this Customs in Notice No. 1499 on February 20th of this year. Now, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, henceforth, the price of goods requiring cargo manifests shall be based on the standard of exceeding ninety gold units. There is no need to convert it into national currency. If the on-board price of imported goods in each bill of lading is ninety gold units or more, then one consular certified cargo manifest must be issued. If the total price is ninety gold units or less, then there is no need to supplement the manifest. As for the conversion rate between gold units and foreign currencies, it should be calculated in accordance with the government's quarterly regulations and those announced by the Customs. Let all merchants be informed. This is a special notice. Supervisor: Zhu Changnian. Tax Commissioner: Balesen.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Repeated Arbitrary Fines for Invoices. Joint Meeting of Various Industries <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Market of Sugar, Seafood, Northern and Southern Goods Industries in this city has recently received reports from members that, in addition to stating the name, quantity, and price of goods sold to various shops in this city on the invoice, and affixing sufficient stamps according to the first category of the stamp tax rate, it is impossible to indicate the total value due to reasons such as tare and deduction. However, the stamp tax inspectors believe it is non-compliant and submit it to the court for trial. The court, without investigating the actual situation, readily imposes a fine of three yuan per invoice. Initially, it was occasional, but recently it has become more frequent. Summons and fines have become exhausting, causing grievances and losses, making it difficult to maintain business. After receiving the report, the market convened a meeting yesterday, attended by more than twenty representatives from the sugar, seafood, southern goods, northern goods, cooked food, longan, exchange, and pickled mustard tuber industries. Qiu Yangzhi presided over the meeting, and Xue Meiting recorded the proceedings. It was believed that the suffering experienced by various industries in the city must be widespread. If they do not appeal for correction, how can they alleviate the hardship? It was decided to state the facts, cite the Ministry of Finance's Decree No. 11462, and jointly send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance, convene an expanded meeting of all relevant industries in the city as soon as possible, and jointly request the government to quickly rectify the situation to avoid harassment and ensure business stability.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Jiang Fangzhen Speaks Freely on Observations Regarding the German-Japanese-Italian Agreement <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Fangzhen, a well-known figure in the army, spoke to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday about his observations on the German-Japanese agreement and the Italian-Japanese exchange of recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and the puppet state of Manchukuo. Mr. Jiang, having recently visited Italy, Germany, and Japan, offered unique insights. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Italy Does Not Wish to Conflict with Russia</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang first stated that Italy's eastward policy is aimed at the Near East, not the Far East. The Near East—Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan—has formed an alliance. Czechoslovakia is allied with France, and France is allied with Soviet Russia, and they all communicate with Soviet Russia. Mussolini is extremely intelligent and understands this situation. For the sake of his eastward policy, he knows that he cannot offend Soviet Russia. Now, the German-Japanese agreement uses anti-communism to resist Soviet Russia. Italy is not foolish and will definitely not participate.</p>
<p>Recognition of the Puppet State of Manchukuo is Also Unlikely</p>
<p>Based on the above, Italy's policy is in the Near East, not the Far East, so it does not want to interfere in the affairs between China and Japan. As for the current agreement between Italy and Japan, I am afraid that Italy will not formally recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo. As far as I know, Italy's establishment of a consulate in Shenyang is temporary, with a term of one year. Italy is currently trying to woo Britain. If Italy considers the things that Britain is unwilling to do in the Far East, it will also be unwilling to do them itself. Moreover, Italy is trying to expand its market in China. Why would it hurt China's feelings because of this? Moreover, the relationship between Italy and Japan has not been very good in the past. Japan had coveted Abyssinia and once planned to send the daughter of a count to marry the prince of Awa, but Italy was jealous and stopped it, preventing the good deed from happening.</p>
<p>Japan's Gains Do Not Outweigh Its Losses</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, it is nothing more than to restore trade with Abyssinia. Since the European War, Japan has exported tens of millions of goods to Abyssinia every year. Now that Abyssinia is occupied by Italy, Japan is naturally unwilling to give up its market in Abyssinia. Therefore, it has no choice but to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia in order to seek Italy's recognition of its rights and interests in Abyssinia. In this regard, Italy has indeed made considerable concessions and approved it. However, we believe that Japan's valuation is not worth the loss. Japan has always regarded itself as the elder brother of the colored people. Now, recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is tantamount to slapping itself in the face. Japan previously wanted to develop its power in India and repeatedly approached Gandhi and Tagore in the movement, but all were rejected. In recent years, it has also approached the Philippines. The result of recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will make it even more despised by the colored people of the East and cut off its own path.</p>
<p>Japanese Public Opinion at Home is Dissatisfied</p>
<p>After the German-Japanese agreement was established, the Japanese officialdom was initially complacent, thinking it was a diplomatic victory, but public opinion did not think so. When I returned to China this time, I passed through Japan and saw that its domestic newspapers were very indifferent to this and did not have a good opinion. Japan once said that it did not want to interfere in European affairs. Isn't it throwing itself into the European vortex by allying with Germany and Italy? This is what its people oppose. When I was in Germany, I heard Germans say that Germany's alliance with Japan was just perfunctory. Moreover, Japan's active approach to China is purely at the suggestion of the military. The financial groups and the people are dissatisfied. One thing proves this: since Matsuoka took over as the president of the South Manchurian Railway Company, the price of each share has fallen by two yuan. Previously, the capitalists planned to invest, but the military stopped them. Now, the military is calling for investment, but the capitalists are unwilling. For example, the recent advocacy of investment in North China is mostly hesitant. The capitalists are afraid that if the military changes its mind one day, all previous efforts will inevitably be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Chamber of Commerce Sends a Petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Prompt Conclusion of a Reciprocal Treaty with South Africa <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: We have recently received a letter from Cen Xinyi and Liang Juekuang, representatives of overseas Chinese returning from South Africa, regarding the implementation of harsh regulations and the mistreatment of overseas Chinese in South Africa. They have sent representatives back to China to request the government to negotiate and conclude a reciprocal trade treaty, or to continue the previous Sino-South African gentlemen's agreement. The original text, in addition to being submitted directly by the representatives, is omitted here. The letter concludes: 'We dare to report to your council, requesting your assistance to save our compatriots.' Based on this, although there are only a few thousand overseas Chinese in South Africa, it is a suitable market for the sale of Chinese goods and is currently in a period of development. It is imperative to actively proceed with negotiating a reciprocal treaty. Yesterday, we read in the newspaper that your ministry has appointed Zhang Shoumo as the new consul-general in South Africa. It would be best to authorize Consul-General Zhang to pay attention to handling this matter in order to achieve the goal of reciprocity. In addition to the petition from the representatives, we hereby telegraph this to your ministry for review. We earnestly request that you consider the difficulties of our compatriots and provide prompt assistance."</p>

<p>Colonel Lan Enbao, an American advisor and commander at the Hangzhou Central Aviation Academy, suddenly died of heart failure at his residence at 7:00 yesterday morning. His remains were transported to Shanghai by hearse in the afternoon. Mr. Lan was known to be in good health, so the news of his death came as a shock to many. According to reports, Mr. Lan had only arrived in China from the United States two months ago. When he passed through Shanghai, it was only for a few days. His wife also resided in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held its eighth executive committee meeting at 2:00 yesterday afternoon. More than ten committee members attended, with Zhou Xuexiang presiding. The following matters were reported: (1) The 27th of this month is the Publicity Day for the Labor World's One-Day Donation to Support Suiyuan.

(2) Labor disputes at the New Ewo and Hessian Bag Factory and the World Rubber Factory have been resolved by the federation and have resumed work. (3) The labor unrest at the Japanese-owned cotton mill has been resolved by Mr. Du Yuesheng, together with representatives from the party and government and Chairman Zhu of the federation, and work has resumed. (4) The Committee for Raising Funds to Purchase Airplanes to Celebrate Life reported that the No. 6 District Silk Reeling Guild had raised $505.45 from male and female workers in various silk factories to purchase airplanes to celebrate life, which has been received.

(6) Chairman Fu of the Suiyuan Provincial Government replied to thank the military and the members for their condolences. The following matters were discussed: (1) A lawyer's letter stated that the permanent legal counsel appointed by the federation would remain effective if the appointer did not terminate the appointment upon expiration. It was resolved to continue the appointment. (2) It was proposed to send two responsible representatives to attend the preparatory meeting for the Citizens' Rally to Suppress Bandits and Resist Insults, to be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. It was resolved that Committee Members Zhu Xuefan and Zhou Xuexiang would attend. (3) The municipal government requested that representatives be sent to participate in the memorial ceremony for the former administrator, Duan, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month.

(5) The Zhengtai Railway Trade Union scheduled a representative assembly. The federation had sent a telegram of congratulations and requested ratification. It was resolved to approve the ratification. (6) The Municipal Citizens' Rally to Suppress Bandits and Resist Insults was scheduled to be held on the 12th of this month.

<h3 id="e110">Commodity Inspection Bureau Inspects Raw Silk Quality <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Excellent Results Build Confidence at Home and Abroad; Plans to Add More Manpower and Equipment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's inspection of raw silk originally only enforced compulsory inspection of the weight. The quality inspection was left to the free decision of the silk merchants. This year, the Ministry of Industry, believing that the overseas silk market requires a large quantity of uniform-quality goods, which cannot compete with other countries without implementing compulsory raw silk quality inspection, ordered the bureau to implement raw silk quality inspection from August 1st. Since its implementation, it has gained the trust of Chinese and foreign silk merchants. It is reported that foreign silk industry organizations have repeatedly decided to write to the bureau to praise the accuracy of the inspection. Silk trade based on the bureau's inspection certificate is promising. However, the bureau's current manpower and equipment for raw silk inspection can only inspect about 300 bales of raw silk per day, while the daily reported quantity often reaches more than 400 bales. The responsible personnel of the bureau's silk group supervise the staff to intensify their work, working day and night, but it is still difficult to cope. The bureau is now planning to report to the Ministry of Industry to add to the budget and appropriately expand the manpower and equipment in order to cope with the current situation, so that the general silk merchants can be more satisfied and to prepare for the compulsory implementation of raw silk grade inspection in February next year.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Lianyi Society's Dispute with Employees; Two Fellow-Provincial Associations Mediate <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The No. 4 District Civil Boat Carriers' Union and the Guangbang Lianyi Society had a dispute over the issue of employees, which had been unresolved for a long time. Yesterday afternoon, the Ningbo and Guangdong fellow-provincial associations specially consulted to mediate. The Ningbo fellow-provincial association was represented by Mao Heyuan, Zhang Jiguang, Chu Qiaqing, Jin Tingsun, Wu Yaqin, and Tang Xinqin; the Guangdong fellow-provincial association was represented by Li Dachao, Guo Qiming, Guo Zhongliang, and Chen Qifen. Yu Qiaqing presided over the meeting. After reviewing the written opinions of both parties, the following three measures were proposed: (1) All fruit cases of the commercial firms belonging to the Lianyi Hall shall continue to be handled by the workers of the Civil Boat Carriers' Union, and one cent (i.e., one copper coin) shall be added to the original price per case. (2) The issue of new workers leaving or staying shall be properly handled by the trade union. (3) In the future, workers should fulfill their duties and not be lazy, which shall be the responsibility of the trade union. Based on the above three principles, Guo Qiming of the Guangdong fellow-provincial association was appointed to draft an agreement, which would then be reviewed. However, the investor side stated to the fellow-provincial association that the investor has the right to independently hire workers. The two associations decided to postpone the mediation.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Qiu Jiyu Confesses to Participating in the Murder of Tang Youren; Court Reschedules Trial for the 16th to Be Heard Jointly with Liu Zhennan's Case <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Transportation, and advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from Hunan, was assassinated in front of his private residence at No. 12 Gan Cun, Ganxi Road, French Concession, at around 5:00 p.m. on December 25th of last year. The murderer fled the scene immediately. After the French Police Department and our government offered a reward for his arrest, the Public Concession Police Department cracked a theft case in June or July of this year and arrested six bandits, including Qiu Jiyu, and seized a handgun. It was found that this gun was the same as the one used to kill Tang. After the Special No. 1 Court sentenced the theft case, the French Police Department took Qiu and others back and sent them to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and investigation. Because Qiu and others denied participating in the Tang case and there was no conclusive evidence, they were not prosecuted. Qiu and the other six defendants were sent back to the Special No. 1 Court for execution. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Liu Zhennan, a suspect in the Tang case, who confessed that Qiu Jiyu and several others, including those surnamed Yang, Xiao, and Xiang, were involved. Liu was transferred to the Special No. 2 Court and sent to the Police Department for investigation. On the 30th of last month, Judge Wang of the Special No. 2 Court held a hearing and prohibited spectators. As a result, the court ordered further investigation and rescheduled the hearing for the 16th of this month. At the same time, the French Police Department requested the Special No. 2 Court to prepare a document to send detectives to transfer Qiu Jiyu to court for interrogation. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Qiu was transferred from the Special No. 1 Court on the previous day by detectives Dai Rongji and Zuo Qihong of the French Police Department with a document. It was found that Qiu Jiyu, also known as Zhao Xiangbao and Zhao Qiyu, was 26 years old and originally from Shengxian County, Zhejiang. He had previously committed a kidnapping case and was sentenced to five years by the French Concession Court. After serving his sentence, he was sent to the inland government for interrogation. After serving his sentence, the Special No. 2 Court reviewed the case and sentenced him to five years and two months of imprisonment. The number of days in prison was counted as execution. Qiu committed the crime of participating in the assassination of Tang Youren after being released after serving his sentence for the kidnapping case. He escaped and was later arrested and imprisoned for theft. When questioned about the Tang case, he confessed without hesitation. At noon yesterday, he was escorted to the Special No. 2 Court, where Judge Sun Pengxian, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, held a hearing in the Criminal Division. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the facts of the case and requested that the hearing be rescheduled to the 16th to be heard jointly with Liu Zhennan's case, and that spectators be prohibited due to the importance of the case. The court approved the request and rescheduled the hearing for the 16th to be heard jointly with Liu Zhennan's case. It is reported that Qiu confessed to participating in the assassination and that he was the one who fired the gun.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Arnold, Speaks on Finances <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Says That in Order to Balance Income and Expenditure, It Is Necessary to Increase the Patrol Tax</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, spoke at a meeting of the British Association on Friday on the financial situation of the Municipal Council, stating that since 1929, the ordinary income of the Municipal Council has been insufficient to cover expenditure every year. Since 1932, funds have been allocated from the gold stored in the electricity facilities to make up for the shortfall. This gold is now almost exhausted, so it is necessary to find other ways to balance the budget. In the past three years, major efforts have been made to economize, saving 3.5 million yuan. Major expenditures that are absolutely necessary have been postponed. The only stable policy being pursued is to balance income and expenditure, and it is inevitable to increase the patrol tax and borrow money to cover major expenditures. If we continue not to balance the budget, it will gradually become difficult to borrow money on reasonable terms to cover major expenditures. Due to the recent austerity measures, savings have been made in the fire brigade, public works, the office of the general manager of the business community, the intelligence office, and the rickshaw office, totaling 70,000 yuan. Together with the results of the Staff Committee's proposals, 106,000 yuan can be saved, totaling 176,000 yuan. However, most of this will only be implemented in 1937, and full implementation will require until 1938. Therefore, the shortfall for this year, calculated based on the figures for the first half of the year, amounts to 3.25 million yuan. The original budget estimated the shortfall at 2 million yuan, which was to be made up by allocating funds from the reserve fund, but this fund is almost exhausted as a result. However, the actual shortfall exceeds the estimate by more than 60%, so major economies must be made next year in order to overcome the difficulties. We will start the year with a shortfall of 1.25 million yuan, so the 1937 budget, excluding the aforementioned savings, will amount to 4 million yuan, accounting for 4% of the patrol tax. It is not known how the shortfall for this year and next year will be made up. The measure of greatly increasing the patrol tax will be unavoidable. If it can be increased by 2% and borrow money to make up for the remaining estimated shortfall and to cover the required major expenditures, then by 1938, when the aforementioned savings can be fully realized, the debts on the books can be cleared at once. Thus, an increase of 2% in the patrol tax will be sufficient to meet future needs. If we delay longer, the amount of the increase in the patrol tax will be higher. If we do not adopt a stable policy as soon as possible and allow the shortfall to extend for another year or two, I am afraid that the patrol tax will inevitably increase by 4%. If it is increased by 2%, those who pay 100 yuan in rent per month will only have to pay 25 yuan in tax per year, or those who pay 200 yuan in rent per month will only have to pay 48 yuan in tax. Mr. Arnold finally spoke of the reasons for hastily adopting the report of the Economic Committee without first giving the staff the opportunity to comment, saying that it was because the budget for next year was being drafted and the committee's proposals had to be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Local Association Cables Provincial Government Again: Do Not Detain Rice Boats <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association yesterday sent a cable to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: "To Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang: We refer to the previous telegram requesting that the Qingpu and Jinshan county governments be instructed to release the Shanghai merchants' rice boats that they had detained. We are grateful for your consideration. We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association stating that more than 20 Changshu rice boats sailing to Shanghai were detained by the Jiwang Temple Public Security Bureau in Jiading County on the 1st of this month. The central government has already approved the free circulation of grain, but the county governments are still detaining them one after another, making it difficult for merchants to transport and further impoverishing the people. The Shanghai rice industry has already suspended trading due to a shortage of goods, and the impact on public order is worrying. We hereby send another telegram to your government, requesting that you instruct all counties to release the detained Shanghai merchants' rice boats immediately and strictly order them not to repeat such incidents in the future. We earnestly submit this appeal and respectfully request a reply by telegram."</p>

<p>The movement to resume business at Tongyi Trust Company has progressed smoothly since its inception. This is largely because Mr. Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and Wang Xiaolai generously took on the role of coordination, solely out of concern for the public interest of the creditors, which is in line with the psychology of the creditors. Various creditor groups have responded enthusiastically and have established a joint office to supervise and support the resumption of business from the sidelines. It was also learned yesterday that representatives of creditors from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Pinghu have arrived in Shanghai one after another, preparing to attend the creditors' meeting to be held at the Lake Society at 2:00 p.m. today. It is expected that a large number of people will attend. In addition to electing supervisors, they will pass the coordination plan and support the resumption of business.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Continued Fundraising for Aircraft Donation for Birthday Celebration - Additional 280,000 Yuan Needed <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations to Resolve Aircraft Purchase</p>
<p>The fundraising in this city to donate aircraft for a birthday celebration is still insufficient. The Shanghai Committee for Memorial Aircraft Donation for President Chiang's Birthday has repeatedly urged the collection of funds. The committee specially convened a meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday afternoon at [blank] o'clock, inviting representatives from various naming organizations to discuss ways to raise the remaining funds for early completion. Attendees included Tong Xingbai from the Party Headquarters, Mao Heyuan from the Ningbo Association, Shi Linghan from the Public Security Bureau, Liu Yuwen from the Military Training Association, representatives from specialized industries, the grain industry, and the meat industry, as well as the Executive Director of the committee, Fu Dachao. Li Dachao reported that 660,000 yuan had already been raised for the aircraft donation for [blank] birthday, with over 30,000 yuan remaining from previous fundraising efforts by the China Aviation Association, in addition to other uncounted donations. The latest donations received by the committee bring the total to over 720,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 280,000 yuan. Based on the agreed amount, the specialized industries guild still needs 80,000 yuan, the grain industry guild 75,000 yuan, the Ningbo Association 35,000 yuan, the military training students over 25,000 yuan, the meat industry guild 50,000 yuan, the Public Security Bureau 10,000 yuan, and the funds pledged by the City Party Headquarters. The remaining amount is actually not much, but due to factual circumstances, the donated funds must be paid in installments, which has prevented the committee from concluding its work immediately. Therefore, the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss ways to expedite the collection and completion. Subsequently, the representative from the Military Training Association reported that over 20,000 yuan of the pledged funds had not yet been collected and that they were actively pursuing collection. However, the pledged amounts are scattered and difficult to collect. They will intensify their efforts to collect and remit the funds. The representative from the City Party Headquarters reported that they were actively promoting the fundraising and expected to complete the collection by the end of the month. The representative from the Ningbo Association reported that if calculated based on 80,000 yuan, they still needed 15,000 yuan, which they would remit soon. If calculated based on 10 yuan, they would need to further promote the fundraising. The representative from the Public Security Bureau reported that the funds donated by the bureau were mostly deducted from salaries, and it would be extremely difficult to collect more. Director Cai intends to hold a one-day sports event to raise funds for the aircraft donation, with an estimated shortfall of over 5,000 yuan. After discussions, the following resolutions were reached: (1) Each organization will actively promote fundraising to meet the predetermined amount and remit the funds within this month. (2) For the remaining donations from various industries, banks can be approached for loans for advance payment, with gradual repayment. (3) The Chamber of Commerce has already remitted 3000 yuan from the one-day sports event, and it is requested that the remaining funds be remitted to supplement the birthday donation. It is also heard that the committee will convene a general meeting as soon as the donation amount is fully collected to discuss the conclusion of the fundraising, which is expected to be by the end of this month. Furthermore, the committee has received continued donations for the aircraft donation for the birthday celebration: 30 yuan from Mao Zijian, 30 yuan from the Fancang Temple, 30 yuan from the Jade Buddha Temple, and 10,000 yuan from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce as the second batch of one-day sports event donations. Acknowledgement receipts have been issued and thank-you letters sent separately.</p>

<p>The Consolidated Tax Bureau Agrees to Improve Methods and Investigate and Punish Corrupt Inspectors</p>
<p>The Fenyang Wine Industry Association of this city previously submitted a joint letter from its members requesting intervention to stop inspectors from abusing their power and illegally inspecting alcoholic beverages. It has successively petitioned the Party and government organs and the Consolidated Tax Bureau to find ways to stop this. The City Chamber of Commerce has also sent a letter to the Consolidated Tax Bureau requesting a stop to such practices, but with little effect. Recently, new incidents have continued to occur, arousing strong indignation in the industry. 125 businesses signed a letter requesting the association to convene a general membership meeting to discuss ways to intervene and stop these practices. In response, the association specially sent five representatives, Xie Zhendong, Liu Bingsheng, Zhou Yuangao, Dai Ming, Peng Jun, and others, on behalf of all members, to submit petitions to the City Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Consolidated Tax Bureau, and the Shanghai Bao Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Inspection Sub-bureau, requesting relief on the following points: (1) Request that inspectors be prevented from entering stores to inspect alcoholic beverages, to protect business operations. (2) Request that the Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Shanghai Bao Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Inspection Sub-bureau thoroughly investigate illegal inspectors to uphold law and order. (3) Request the publication of effective methods for distinguishing fake wine to avoid confusion. The City Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the City Chamber of Commerce have all agreed that the inspectors' intrusion into stores to inspect alcoholic beverages, causing disturbance to merchants' reputation and extortion, is inappropriate. They have agreed to consult the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Bureau and the Shanghai Bao Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to strictly prohibit such practices. The Consolidated Tax Bureau has agreed to improve the methods for inspectors entering stores to inspect alcoholic beverages. The Shanghai Bao Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau has agreed to investigate and punish corrupt inspectors.</p>

<h3 id="e121">For Detained Rice Boats in Jiading County - The Bean and Rice Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday - Decided to Send Gu Xinyi and Others to Zhenjiang to Petition <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Jiading County government detained over 200 rice boats destined for Shanghai in the upper reaches of the Wusong River, not only disrupting waterway traffic in the interior but also causing increasing anxiety about the food supply in this city. The Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city convened an emergency meeting of rice merchants throughout the city at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road to discuss the case in detail. It was considered that the detention of rice in Jiading not only brought the rice market in northern Shanghai to a standstill but, if continued, would cause great panic about the food supply in this city. As this city is not a rice-producing area, and the rice supply from southern Shanghai is insufficient, rice prices in the northern market are rising daily. It was decided to send Gu Xinyi, Jiang Zisheng, and Lu Jingwen to Zhenjiang to request the Jiangsu Provincial authorities to send a telegram ordering the Jiading County government to immediately release all detained rice boats. It was also requested that the City Chamber of Commerce and local associations submit a document to the Jiangsu Provincial government requesting the prompt release of the detained rice boats and ordering all counties in the province to refrain from detaining rice to protect the food supply in this city and comply with the central government's decree on the circulation of domestic rice and grain. It is reported that Gu and others will take an early train to Zhenjiang on the morning of the 7th to meet with Chairman Chen and Director Yu to request the release of the detained rice boats.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Tobacco Advisor Niu Sen Assassinated - Tax Administration Sends Telegram to Investigate - Xuchang Tobacco Company Not Government-Run <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to the Kuomintang News Agency, reports state that Niu Sen, an American advisor to the Nanjing government and manager of the government-run Xuchang Tobacco Company, was shot and killed in Xuchang, and the motive of the perpetrators was largely resentment towards the official operation of the tobacco business. The reporter specifically went to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance to investigate the truth of the matter. According to the person in charge of the department, the department had previously ordered a large number of tobacco seeds from the United States and transported them to Xuchang and other places to distribute to farmers because the tobacco leaves produced in various parts of our country were produced using traditional methods, and farmers did not know how to improve cultivation, resulting in a decline in product quality and sales. The department also hired American tobacco experts to guide planting to improve the quality of tobacco and cultivate tax sources. Niu Sen, an American citizen, was the department's hired expert advisor for the improvement of tobacco leaves. He has been in office for four years and has made great contributions to improving tobacco leaves and providing guidance. The department has reported that Niu Sen was assassinated in Xuchang. According to the report of the American Tobacco Improvement Committee, the department has telegraphed the Yuzhong Tax Administration Office to investigate the cause and has discussed with the local authorities to strictly arrest the perpetrators. The Xuchang Tobacco Company is purely a commercial company and not government-run. The department's American Tobacco Improvement Committee is a technical organization dedicated to improving tobacco leaves. The reports in various newspapers that the government operates the tobacco business are not true.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wages Robbed from Shenxin No. 9 Factory - Iron Box Snatcher Shot - Guard Wu Zishan Pursues Robbers - Robber Wang Shaohua Shot in Six Places - Original Stolen 1800 Yuan Recovered <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Macao Road, western Shanghai, has a large number of male and female workers, so its wages are paid daily. At 9:05 PM the night before last, Gu Zuyu, the accountant of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, from Wuxi, and foreman Zhu Guojun were preparing to issue wages when two robbers suddenly broke in, each holding a pistol, forbidding anyone from making a sound. They snatched a small iron box containing 1800 yuan in legal tender from the accountant's table and fled. When they ran out the door, they were spotted by Wu Zishan, a Hua detective No. 767 guarding the factory gate. Seeing one of the robbers fleeing with an iron box, he knew they were robbers and blew his whistle and drew his self-defense pistol, chasing after them and firing three shots. One of the robbers fell in response, while the other escaped. The injured robber was apprehended, a "lotus sprinkler" pistol with five bullets was seized, and the stolen 1800 yuan was recovered. The incident was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent detectives to transport the injured robber to the police hospital. The injured robber was identified as Wang Shaohua, 35 years old, from Nanjing, with six gunshot wounds to his abdomen, waist, and right leg (as the bullets had all passed through). He was kept in the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, reported the incident to Judge Huang Risheng of the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, requesting a postponement. He stated that at around 6:00 AM this morning, the police had also found a "lotus sprinkler" pistol with five bullets inside the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, which was thought to have been dropped by one of the escaping robbers. However, it is suspected that the robbery of Shenxin No. 9 Factory was the result of collaboration with insiders, as the back door of the factory, located on Moganshan Road, was originally equipped with a very large secret lock, which was found to have been replaced after the incident. Subsequently, Gu Zuyu, the accountant, testified to the robbery, and Judge Huang postponed the case, awaiting Wang Shaohua's recovery before further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Capital Express - Maintaining Punctuality - Various Discount and Free Tickets Not Applicable - Station Staff and Passengers Should Prepare in Advance <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that the "Capital Express" on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is about to operate. However, because the number of seats on the train is limited, various discount or free tickets are not applicable, and official cars cannot be added. With the approval of the Executive Yuan, it will be handled in accordance with the precedent before the opening of the Shanghai-Ping express. The relevant order from the ministry states: "It is hereby ordered that it shall be dealt with in accordance with the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 6288 dated October 24, 1936, and the National Government's Instruction No. 788 dated October 21, 1936. Regarding the opening of a high-speed special express train between Nanjing and Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, named the 'Capital Express', it is proposed to follow the precedent of the Shanghai-Ping express. In addition to round-trip tickets, all kinds of official travel passes, all kinds of discount and free tickets, and preferential tickets will not be applicable to the 'Capital Express'. Furthermore, due to the shorter travel time and the limited number of cars, this train shall not be used for private cars to maintain income and show restrictions. Please notify and order compliance, as requested in the memorandum submitted by the Secretariat of this Committee to the Executive Yuan, which stated that the Executive Yuan had approved the Ministry of Railways' memorandum, in order to open a high-speed special express train between Nanjing and Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, named the 'Capital Express'. It is proposed to follow the precedent of the Shanghai-Ping express. In addition to round-trip tickets, all kinds of official travel passes, all kinds of discount and free tickets, and preferential tickets will not be applicable to the 'Capital Express'. Furthermore, due to the shorter travel time and the limited number of cars, this train shall not be used for private cars to maintain income and show restrictions. Please notify and order compliance, etc., which was approved at the 81st meeting of this Yuan and sent to the Central Political Committee, instructing them to verify and forward the matter. After deliberation, it was reported to the 24th meeting of this Committee and approved. In addition to notifying the Central Executive Committee, the case shall be filed, and a copy of the original letter shall be sent for verification and notification, and an order shall be given to comply, etc. This should be dealt with in accordance with the above. In addition to replying by letter and distributing the order, the attached document shall be copied and ordered to be followed, and those under its jurisdiction shall be ordered to comply, etc., by order, etc., this shall be complied with, etc., this is the order," etc. It is heard that as the express train has been sped up, it is essential not to miss the travel time. The Traffic Department of the road has separately ordered the following measures to maintain punctuality: (1) Before the train arrives at the station, the stationmaster on duty should instruct the relevant staff to be stationed at the service location, plan and arrange all necessary matters in advance, and place outbound luggage and packages in suitable locations. The stacking of luggage and packages must have a specific sequence and location to avoid difficulties at the loading and unloading stations. Other procedures for handling receipt, delivery, and signing must also be as fast and simple as possible. (2) If there is a large amount or heavy luggage and packages to be shipped out, sufficient porters should be prepared in advance to quickly load and transport them, ensuring that it is completed within the specified time. At the same time, the loading and unloading stations must be notified so that they can be prepared. Once the departure time is reached, loading and unloading should be stopped. Any luggage and packages left behind should be kept and transported on the next earliest train. (3) Outbound travelers should be informed by the stationmaster on duty, the station police, and the station staff of the appropriate location to stand in order to board the train calmly and avoid rushing around. If passengers are carrying heavy or large quantities of hand luggage, they should be advised to put it in the luggage compartment. The elderly, the young, and passengers with slow movement should be assisted by station staff to board the train. If the departure time has arrived, the train should be ordered to depart immediately. If there are still passengers who have not boarded the train after the train has started, they should be advised to take the next earliest train and not stop the train again. (4) Before the train arrives at the stopping station, the train staff should notify the passengers getting off the train to prepare in advance to avoid being rushed and delaying the travel time. (5) Other trains related to the "Capital Express" should also strictly maintain their punctuality to avoid interfering with the meeting and causing delays. (6) If special circumstances are discovered, other related stations should be notified immediately to prepare in advance to avoid delaying the travel time.</p>

<p>Huang Xiandi, a woman from Jiangyin (19 years old), who lives at No. 3 Wufu Lane, Beijing Road, has been working at the Hongxing Cloth Factory in Xiaonanmen, Huajie. On November 28, at 6:00 PM, she was abducted by a local rogue named Zhang Gen at the factory gate, in collusion with Zhang Yonghua from Shaoxing, who runs a boat. The next day at noon, they abducted 8-year-old A'fa, the young son of Shan Aosheng, a fellow villager residing on North Fujian Road, and hid him in Zhang's boat in the Lao Zha Bridge river. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Zhang Yonghua and Zhang Gen, together with Huang and A'fa, went to the Osaka Pier in Yangshupu, bought boat tickets, and boarded the Japanese Zhoushan Maru ship, intending to go to Fujian to sell Huang and A'fa for profit. Liu Baoshan, a Hua detective from the Huishan Police Station, and Zhu Youxiong, a wharf watchman, noticed Zhang Yonghua's suspicious behavior and interrogated him. He was evasive, so they arrested him. Zhang Gen took the opportunity to escape. They took the girl and the child to the police station and detained them. Huang and A'fa were taken back by their families. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and requested a postponement. Subsequently, Shan Aosheng and Huang testified about the incident. In light of the defendant's evasive testimony, Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to remain in custody and postponed the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Scoundrel in the Medical Profession Actually Solicits Patients for Profit - Xu Jisheng in Front of Renji Hospital - Doctor Cuts Off Name and Address on Prescriptions <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The number of stomach doctors in this city is increasing daily, but regardless of whether the doctors are genuine or not, they all compete for business, except for a few famous doctors. The methods of competition were originally limited to publicity, but recently there has been a method of soliciting patients. In front of major hospitals, those who seek treatment are temporarily solicited, which not only affects the reputation of Chinese and Western doctors but also greatly harms the health of the population. Renji Hospital had previously detained Xu Jisheng, who was lingering in front of the hospital to solicit patients, and sent him to the police station. He was lightly reprimanded and released because he had not committed any illegal acts. Xu was soliciting business for Liu Baoguang (also known as Liu Songshi), a Cantonese who runs the Baoguang Hospital at No. 47 South Tiantong Road, Hongkou. Therefore, after being reprimanded and released, he still relied on Liu for a living. At 11:30 AM on the 4th, Gu Boyu, a woman living north of Hanqiao, brought her daughter Gu Yunzhen to Renji Hospital for throat treatment. Just as they arrived at the hospital gate and asked about the throat department, a person approached Gu and said that the throat doctor in the hospital would not be in until the afternoon. If they needed treatment, he could take them to his house to avoid delay. He then hired a rickshaw for Gu and her daughter and led the car to the intersection of South Tiantong Road. Xu Jisheng, who was originally lingering there, saw them and, knowing that they were seeking medical treatment, invited Gu and her daughter into the hospital. Gu paid the registration fee of one yuan and the registration fee of two cents. Afterwards, Gu asked the people in the hospital when the doctor would go to Renji. At that time, Liu Songshi was sitting in the consulting room. Hearing this, he immediately claimed to be a doctor and said that he only went to Renji every afternoon, and he also had to treat patients at Baolong and Guangci Hospitals. After examining Gu's daughter and writing a prescription, he suddenly cut off the part of the prescription that had the doctor's name and address printed on it. Gu thought that the important part of the prescription was the doctor's name and address. If the prescription did not have this mark, it would be as if the doctor was not responsible, so she argued with Liu. Liu knew that Gu was not easy to deceive and replaced it with a full prescription. However, after Gu took her daughter home, she felt that Liu's actions were suspicious, so she did not get the medicine and instead took her daughter to Renji Hospital to inquire if there was a doctor named Liu among the hospital's throat doctors. The hospital found out that there was no doctor Liu. Gu laughed it off. Unexpectedly, when she left the hospital, she saw Xu Jisheng recruiting patients for Liu there again. She immediately informed the hospital authorities, who reported it to the police station, and detectives were sent to arrest Xu. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Ye interrogated him, and police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the incident and requested that Xu be detained for further investigation. Gu also came to court to testify to everything. In light of Xu's testimony that he was soliciting business for Liu Songshi and did not receive fixed remuneration, the court ordered Xu Jisheng to be detained for further hearing on the 8th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Yang Yushan and Others Engage in Anomalous Behavior by Impersonating Officials and Swindling Money; Dismissed County Magistrate Solicits Lawsuits in Front of the Courthouse; Longhua Monk Refuses Payment for Failed Efforts; Judge Opens Trial, Defendants Deny Involvement <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yang Yushan from Yixing, 42 years old, residing at No. 6 in front of the Shanghai Local Court, ran the Yang Fuxing Coal and Charcoal Shop. Wang Bingquan from Hunan, also known as Wang Bingjun and Wang Yaozu, 49 years old, a graduate of Anhui Political Science School, passed the county magistrate examination and was assigned to Zhejiang. Due to a case, he was dismissed from his position, his wife and children left him, and he was destitute. He set up a character splitting stall in front of the Shanghai Local Court. After July of this year, he became a permanent clerk in the Local Court. Sun Yuchen from Hangzhou, 33 years old, residing in Tiande Lane, Haichao Road, was a freight company broker. These three were usually very close. Yang Yushan, at No. 1 Renlin Lane, Huanghe Road (i.e., Rue Laguerre) in the French Concession, co-founded the Zhengchi Law Firm to make a living, specializing in soliciting lawsuits. Wang Bingquan and Sun Yuchen also frequently visited. In May of this year, a case occurred at Shanghai Longhua Temple where Deputy Abbot Hong Kui committed sodomy on a temple worker, Yang Shouchang, and was sued for theft and detention. Hong Kui's disciple, Abbot Daheng, hired lawyer Yang Maoqian to handle the case. At the same time, Hong Kui's friend, Gan Tianran, went with Abbot Daheng to the Zhengchi Law Firm to ask Yang Yushan to find a way in court. Yang Yushan impersonated a court clerk, claiming to know the judge handling the case and demanded 500 yuan, guaranteeing bail and acquittal. Abbot Daheng later learned that Hong Kui was sentenced to three years and two months, and the bail never materialized. The promised money was not paid. The incident came to light when the court received a letter addressed to Yang Yushan, Court Clerk, from someone named Kuifa, revealing the fraudulent situation in the Hong Kui case. The Local Court found that there was no Yang Yushan among the court clerks and ordered the deceased Chief Clerk Xuan Maohe to investigate the previous situation and arrest Yang Yushan, transferring him to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation by Prosecutor Mei Yinjie. The Second Special District Court was requested to assist in the search of the Zhengchi Law Firm organized by Yang. At the same time, a letter from Sun Yuchen to Wang Bingquan was found, stating, "At 11 o'clock, I received a call from Liu Lin (i.e., Lin Sheng), mentioning that the money has not been collected yet and needs to be discussed again in the afternoon... (omitted)... The complaint from Du Akang has been signed. If Liu Linsheng comes again, please sign that one hundred yuan cannot settle the matter (omitted)..." The letter ended with "Just say the summons has been issued, and it may not be resolved immediately." Judging from the wording, there was clear evidence of joint fraud. Wang Bingquan and Sun Yuchen were subsequently arrested and detained, and all visitation was suspended. Multiple investigative hearings were held. Yang denied all accusations, but Chief Clerk Xuan's investigation report proved that Yang did indeed claim to be a court clerk, claiming to know nine out of ten judges and even said after the verdict that he could ask Judge Wu Xiangzu to correct it, but his one hundred yuan was not paid and would only be paid when his master was released. Based on the seized letter, the Liu Linsheng case was investigated and found to be where Du Akang accused his wife, Ding Aying, of adultery with Liu Linsheng. The three jointly defrauded Liu Linsheng of 100 yuan, which was also confirmed during testimony and the money was never paid. It was also heard that Yang Yushan, Wang Bingquan, and Sun Yuchen were attacking each other in court, allegedly due to uneven distribution of the fraudulent proceeds. Wang Bingquan, acting as a clerk, first sent the letter signed Kuifa to Yang Yushan, intentionally sending it to the Local Court, as the new President Lu and Chief Clerk Yi had just taken office and were determined to take swift action. Yang was thus caught in the net. After Yang was arrested, he implicated Wang Bingquan and Sun Yuchen in court, but the search resulted in the discovery of evidence of fraud, leading to their collective downfall, a true result of mutual destruction. Therefore, the prosecutor, based on the investigation results, charged Yang Yushan with impersonating a public official and defrauding money, but since the money was not obtained, he should be charged with attempted fraud. Wang Bingquan and Sun Yuchen were also charged with attempted fraud. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the trial. The defendants all denied the allegations, and their attitudes were not as combative as during the investigative hearings, as they each attempted to exonerate themselves. The judge, because the witnesses in this case were not all present, ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>The three agencies, *Shishi Xinbao*, *Da Wanbao*, and *Shenshi Electric News Agency*, have been reorganizing since April of last year when General Manager Zhang Zhuping resigned. Initially, Du Yuesheng acted as the general manager, followed by Wei Daoming, who was appointed by the board of directors. Later, due to Wei's departure abroad, Dong Xianguang was invited to act as an agent by a joint meeting of the three agencies' directors and supervisors. Now, Dong has expressed his resignation to the board of directors, citing his numerous concurrent positions making it difficult to manage the affairs of the three agencies effectively. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the three agencies' directors and supervisors held a joint meeting at the New Asia Building on North Sichuan Road. The directors and supervisors present acknowledged Dong's active reorganization of the three agencies internally since his appointment, which had achieved remarkable results. They repeatedly and sincerely urged him to stay, but Dong's intention to resign was firm. Consequently, Director Cui Weiwu was recommended to succeed Dong as the general manager of the three agencies. Cui has many years of experience in the news industry and is highly knowledgeable. His acceptance of this challenging role is expected to be a pleasant success. The colleagues of the three agencies have expressed their support, it is said.</p>

<p>1.  China Bookstore, Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>China Bookstore Co., Ltd. originally scheduled its 26th annual shareholders' meeting for yesterday afternoon at the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai. However, based on a temporary proposal from shareholders, it was changed to a temporary meeting. It was decided to change the accounting year to run from January 1st to the end of December as one year. The 25th accounting period, which was originally set to end at the end of June of the 25th year, was changed to end at the end of December of the 25th year. It was also resolved to increase the capital by two million yuan, bringing the total capital to four million yuan. Old shareholders will subscribe to four shares for every five shares they hold, leaving 20% for employees, staff, and those connected to the cultural field. All of these were passed, but because the number of households present did not exceed half, the resolution was considered provisional. It was decided to convene a second shareholders' meeting on the 27th of this month in accordance with Article 186 of the Company Law, it is said.</p>
<p>1.  Han Changlin Denies Participating in Murder, Related to Tang Jikun's "Rhapsody" Case</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Tang Jikun, also known as Xiao Qiao, a Chaozhou native, who resided at No. 29 Bao'an Fang, Dongxin Bridge Street, French Concession, made a substantial profit selling red pills. This attracted the covetousness and blackmail attempts of ruffians and hooligans. On July 20th of the 22nd year, at 8:00 AM, Tang was walking outside, passing the entrance of Baoxing Li, Dongxin Bridge Street, when he was dragged by five or six hooligans in front of No. 14 Baoxing Li. When their blackmail attempt failed, the hooligans lifted Tang's limbs and violently threw him to the ground in a move commonly called "arranging three and earth", causing Tang's death from injuries. Afterwards, the French police arrested a suspect named A Si Mapizi, who was handed over to the Second Special Court for prosecution and sentenced to five years in prison. He has now served his term and been released. At that time, according to the suspect's confession, he and other fugitives, including Xue A'gen (aka Xiao Suzhou), Zhao A'er, Zhang Zhulin, Xiao Long, a countryman, and Xiao Changlin (aka Han Changlin), jointly blackmailed Tang. When that failed, they killed him. The French police immediately dispatched detectives to arrest the fugitives. In January of the 24th year, Xue A'gen, the principal offender in the case, was apprehended and sent to the Special Court, where he was sentenced to twelve years in prison after interrogation. The offender appealed to the Third Higher Branch Court, which reduced the sentence to eight years. The offender still dissatisfied, appealed to the Supreme Court, which has now ordered a retrial. The circumstances of the initial investigation by the Third Higher Branch Court have been reported in this newspaper. Now, Yang Yilong, an investigator for the French police, discovered that Han Changlin, aka Xiao Changlin, age 23, a native of Pudong and an accomplice in the case, was hiding at No. 112 Huadong Li, Kunming Road, Hongkou. He and the Public Concession Police apprehended Han at noon the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Second Special Court. Judge Sun Pengwei interrogated him in the First Criminal Tribunal. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case and requested an extension for further investigation before proceeding with the trial. During the interrogation, Han confessed to knowing that Xiao Suzhou, Xue A'gen, and others had killed Tang, but he had not participated. He said that someone had reported him out of spite because he had refused to lend them money, resulting in his arrest. The court adjourned the hearing to the 15th and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>
<p>1.  Slick Bookstore Commits Fraud, Sui Zhuru Accused of Swindling and Corrupting Morals, Book Industry Association Investigation Confirms</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Sui Zhuru, a 32-year-old native of Dantu, opened the "Slick Cultural Bookstore" at No. 32 Gufuli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. He mailed out a large number of book catalogs, making exaggerated claims and extensively advertising with announcements such as "Grand Opening," "Huge Sale," and "Free Gifts." In reality, there wasn't a single book in the catalog, and the so-called "Grand Building" was a dilapidated house sublet from someone else. The so-called "Various Paintings and Calligraphy" were nude photographs and pornographic books like "The Tinder Monk" and "Garbage Cart." Wang Shounan, from the Yuanchangfu Medicine and Candy Shop in Jingxian, Anhui, saw the exaggerated advertisement and remitted one yuan and thirty-nine cents in national currency to the store on March 21st of this year to purchase the books listed in the catalog, but they were never sent. He then sent a letter to the Shanghai Book Industry Association, requesting an investigation. The association sent a representative, Yuan Xifan, along with the relevant police department to search the premises. They uncovered various pornographic books and pictures. Sui was arrested and sent to the local court, where Prosecutor Lei charged him with fraud under Articles 235 and 123 of the Criminal Code, as well as corrupting morals. Yesterday, Judge Xie Zhengji opened the court session. Sui confessed that the "Grand Building" announcement was for promotional purposes and that the books in the catalog did exist. He also claimed that the books Wang Shounan had purchased had been sent, and that the pornographic pictures and books had been obtained from elsewhere. He retained lawyer Dan Yu to defend him. At this point, Yuan Xifan went to court to provide detailed evidence of Sui's "Slick Bookstore" practices. The judge immediately declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>1.  Current Status of Development of the Chinese Medicine Science Society</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Science Research Society has been publishing a scientific medical journal for half a year. The society's president and chief editors, Xie Liheng, Xu Kai, Fang Gongpu, Gong Xingzhai, and others, are constantly working to improve and promote the society's affairs. They are greatly admired by the Chinese and foreign medical communities. Applications for membership and subscriptions continue to pour in, and the organization of branch societies is even more enthusiastic. According to Director Xu Kai, in the past month alone, there have been no fewer than 30 applications for the establishment of branch societies. Those that have already been established include branches in Minhou, Fuzhou (Moody Min), Fuzhou (Wang Buxi), Changle (Jin Feng Lin Daoji), Huaiyin (Zhang Aichun), Zhenze (Chen Mutian), Nangong, Hebei (Ren Xiangqing), Nanyang (Gao Yuan Zhang Jianchu), Yuanhua, Zhejiang (Shen Qingyuan), and Luxian, Sichuan (Yan Runmin).

<p>1.  Dispute Over Embezzlement by Employees of North China Coal Company, Plaintiff Files Civil Suit, Defendant Claims Forced to Write False Accounts</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Hu Jingqing, the manager of the North China Coal Company branch on the corner of Meierxi Ai Road and Ladu Road (residing at No. 35, Lane 286, Ladu Road), recently reported to the French police that Qiu Wenhao (a native of Ningbo), an employee, had embezzled 1,392.25 yuan from December of last year to September of this year, taking advantage of his position managing coal. It was discovered that he had spent 76 yuan at the sales department and had deposited 200 yuan into the Shanghai Citizen Bank. He had also deposited 313.93 yuan into the Bank of China under the alias Qiu. The person then went into hiding. Later, his brother, Qiu Jinzhang, sent a receipt book from his hometown, which was considered evidence of concealing evidence. Hu requested an investigation. The police chief approved the request, filed the case, and handed it over to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. The plaintiff also hired a lawyer to file a civil suit. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengwei conducted a trial in the First Criminal Tribunal. The plaintiff presented a paper embezzled account written by the defendant. The defendant was interrogated and denied any embezzlement. Regarding the deposits, he said that they were the result of years of hard work. The account presented by the plaintiff was forced to be written, When I wrote this account, the plaintiff explained to me that after writing it, I could still continue to do business, so I wrote it. But the above has forced to write false account four words, Now the plaintiff cut off the four words above, presenting the case, requesting detailed investigation, and extended Wang Shizong lawyer defense. However, in this case, the plaintiff only submitted an account paper as evidence, and no strong evidence was presented. After the court's discussion, it was announced to be concluded and a date was set for the verdict.</p>

<p>2.</p>
<p>The Fujian Native Place Association in Shanghai originally scheduled to convene a members' meeting on the 6th of this month. However, because the registration forms, receipts for membership dues, etc., from the various solicitation teams have not yet been collected, membership certificates and notices could not be issued in advance. Moreover, fellow villagers who have not registered with the solicitation teams have recently come to the association to request an extension of the meeting date so that they can register directly at the meeting. The association believes that this expanded solicitation aims at universality, so it has specially changed the meeting date to 1:00 PM on December 20th, still to be held at the Sanshan Guild Hall on Sima Road. It is said that after this postponement, there will be no further changes. Yesterday, the association formally notified all fellow villagers that those who have not yet joined the association must register before the meeting.</p>

<p>(2) Guohua Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory is for sale. The factory was founded in July of the 24th year with a capital of 30,000 yuan in national currency, plus another 30,000 yuan in national currency, as a partnership. The major shareholder is Mr. Zhang Rongchu, but Mr. Zhang does not appear in person. Instead, Mr. Jing Songnian, another shareholder, serves as the manager. The factory site is on the old site of Tong Qiao Silk Factory, with two additional printing, dyeing, and mercerizing machines. The total equipment is worth over 100,000 yuan. It employs about 60 or 70 workers. It mainly provides printing and dyeing services for customers, and also dyes and sells gray fabrics itself. The maximum daily output can dye over 1,000 pieces of cloth. In the beginning, due to limited capital, the business was very small. Later, with the cooperation of Mr. Zhang, a giant in the dyeing industry, the business greatly improved. However, recently, due to sluggish business, the shareholders are not interested in continuing to operate, so they are selling the factory to the Central Printing and Dyeing Factory, it is said.</p>
<p>(3) Wei Chen Li Ji Silk Company Established. The company's manufacturing plant is located outside the East Gate of Jiaxing. Its predecessor was the Yujia Branch of Hangzhou Wei Cheng Company. The entire plant occupies more than 60 mu of land and is divided into three departments: silk, filature, and cocoon-making. The total construction and machinery equipment cost hundreds of thousands of yuan. In 1931, the factory and Hangzhou's headquarter closed down at the same time. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, since the company had previously mortgaged all of its real estate and machinery, the department guaranteed the issuance of company bonds. Since the company had already closed down, it was unable to fulfill its debt obligations as stipulated. Therefore, the department executed all of the mortgages and leased out the Hangzhou and Jiaxing factories separately. The Yujia Branch's silk department was leased by Wei Cheng Qing Ji. Later, the Department of Finance reached an agreement with the company's bondholders and preferential creditors to put the entire real estate and machinery of the Yujia Branch up for public auction at an estimated price. After three price reductions, the Shanghai Li Ji Company finally won the bid with the lowest price of 767,437 yuan. It also purchased the company's entire trademark rights for a price of 57,000 yuan, renaming it Wei Cheng Li Ji Silk Co., Ltd., specializing in silk. It is heard that the remaining filature and cocoon-making departments are still intended to be leased out. The founding meeting was held in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, and the head office is located at No. 16, Lane 149, Changsha Road in this city. The company was founded by Zheng Zanchen, Bao Mengwei, Zhu Ligeng, and others, and it has strong financial resources. Silk is inherently profitable and a new emerging industry, so the business has a good chance to succeed, it is said.</p>
<p>(4) Jinglun Silk Factory For Sale. The factory was established in 1930 and was founded solely by Mr. Zhou Baoliang. Mr. and Mrs. Zhou were previously workers at Wuhua Silk Factory. They lived frugally and saved a small amount of money, so they bought two looms. The total assets cost about 500 or 600 yuan. The couple worked hard and the business grew gradually. Later, they gradually expanded and purchased a total of nine motors and hired 18 workers and three or four apprentices. They specialized in weaving for landlords, and the livelihood was relatively stable. However, since the spring of last year, the silk industry has been declining due to poor market conditions and has been selling off at reduced prices. The factory was greatly affected. Since the autumn, silk prices have suddenly soared. The factory has a shortage of funds and is unable to advance money for weaving. Moreover, although silk prices have gradually increased, it is difficult to increase silk prices and market purchasing power has suddenly decreased. The situation is very difficult, and eventually it became heavily indebted and unable to maintain operations. Therefore, the creditors sold all of the factory's foundation, property, and machinery to Yuan Fengtai Ji Silk Factory for 600 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>(5) Dasheng Machine Factory Liquidates and Sells. The factory was founded around 1925 and was operated solely by Mr. Xu Qingyun, with no fixed amount of capital. It employed 17 or 18 workers and specialized in manufacturing silk looms and water pumps. In the beginning, business was quite prosperous, especially for silk looms. However, since the January 28th Incident, the business of various silk factories has declined, and the demand for silk looms has also decreased accordingly. After 1934, business became even more sluggish. The factory then transformed to manufacture large and small water pumps. Because there were suitable droughts and disasters in various places at that time, the need for this machine was quite urgent, so it was able to rely on this to support and barely maintain operations. However, after the drought passed, the supply of the machine exceeded the demand, and business fell back into hardship. Extending to the 7th of this month, it finally announced liquidation and sale, it is said. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e134">Cure for Gonorrhea as Urgent as Extinguishing a Raging Fire: How to Treat the Horrific Complications of Gonorrhea!! <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>This publication has repeatedly provided medical and hygiene knowledge about gonorrhea and has been praised for it! Now, we will specifically present the pathological changes of gonorrhea to serve as a reference for patients, so they know how to prevent and handle it, in order to avoid utter disaster and last-minute remedies.</p>
<p>The difficulty in treating gonorrhea is self-evident; however, tracing it to its source, the rapid and aggressive reproduction of gonococci is the primary cause. The tissue of the human penis is a highly vascularized corpus cavernosum. Once infected with gonococci, the bacteria attach to the urethral wall and reside in the mucosa. Therefore, the previously popular transmucosal sterilization therapy aimed to eliminate gonococci by penetrating the mucosa. However, this method soon failed. This is because in the early stages of infection, gonococci initially attach to the urethral mucosa. However, after one or two days, the gonococci penetrate deep into the corpus cavernosum. Through the absorption of blood vessels in this area, they flow into the bloodstream. From then on, the gonococci proliferate continuously, and the resulting complications are too numerous to list. Locally, they include testicular swelling and hardening, prostatitis, cystitis, and infection of women by their husbands resulting in leukorrhea, uterine inflammation, and ulceration. If one partner in a marriage has chronic gonorrhea that is not cured, it can lead to lifelong infertility and even cause spermatorrhea and hematospermia due to prostatitis, endangering life.</p>
<p>As for the systemic symptoms of gonorrhea, such as crippling arthritis and heart valve inflammation, these are the most horrific and dangerous!</p>
<p>So, how should gonorrhea be dealt with? After extensive research in recent years, European and American scholars have discovered a definite and specific treatment. The initial step is to inject gonococci into cattle, horses, and rabbits. Within a week, the animal's blood produces an extraordinary responsive protein. This protein has the effect of promoting phagocytosis of gonococci and increasing anti-gonococcal and anti-toxin activity. Then, this protein is extracted and administered to gonorrhea patients. Its special effect in eliminating gonococci has been confirmed by Shmide and Rudolf, among others. Furthermore, Dr. Bieder has combined this protein with pure yellow pigment with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties to create the oral gonorrhea panacea, "Kelinong." After taking it, the protein contained in the medicine enhances the number of anti-gonococcal antibodies and white blood cells in the patient's body, eradicating gonococci and gonococcal toxins completely! It can completely cure gonorrhea, leukorrhea, orchitis, cystitis, and arthritis in both men and women, restoring fertility! If used in conjunction with "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" for external use, following the instructions to wash the urethra at home, there is no need to visit a doctor. Internal and external application achieves rapid and accurate results!</p>
<p>(Note: "Kelinong" is the most original combination formula. Any combined gonorrhea medicine that does not contain protein is likely a counterfeit!)</p>
<h3 id="e135">Self-Reflection of a Heartbroken Person: Seeking the Capital for Love <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>... The maintenance of love lies not in money or power, but in the magnificence of the physique... Only with a magnificent physique can one achieve permanent victory in love!</p>
<p>It is often said that love is sacred and pure, without conditions of money or power. This may be true. However, if you have an unsound physique and engage with the opposite sex while carrying a hidden illness, the ultimate result will be failure. And the love of the opposite sex will naturally shift to those with sound physiques. Because the focus of love between the two sexes is sexual desire, a male with defects in sexual desire and underdeveloped body will find it difficult to enter the realm of love. This is not only true for humans, but also for animals seeking love. We often see a group of male animals pursuing female animals, and as a result, the female animal accepts the love of the most robust animal among them, leaving behind or even killing the less robust animals. What a cruel love! So, the capital for love is the soundness of the sexual organs, and that is probably not wrong.</p>
<p>Originally, during our developmental period around the ages of fifteen or sixteen, we are often stimulated by our own hormones and external temptations, resulting in resorting to masturbation as a means of releasing sexual energy. Little do we know that once it becomes a habit, the sexual organs become underdeveloped because they do not receive enough internal secretion. The local area becomes short and small, leading to nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and inability to achieve an erection. The person becomes incapable of sexual intercourse, mentally weak, anemic, with dry skin, and early graying of the temples, showing signs of premature aging. Such a male is not only unfit to talk about love, but even married ones are prone to divorce. However, with the progress of modern science, it is not difficult to save them. Dr. Fennpson often used the German medicine "Butikon" in venereal disease hospitals to treat infertile men, totaling more than three thousand five hundred people. Because "Butikon" is a hormone preparation, it can strengthen the sexual organs and promote the development of the lower body, and use "Niles Spermatorrhea Pills" to treat nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, etc. It can be cured in five or six weeks, the muscles become full, the nutrition is good, the white hair turns black, and the face becomes plump and the demeanor becomes moving. Then love can be maintained forever, so "Butikon" is the savior of young people who are heartbroken.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Long-Confined Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients' Desired Self-Treatment Has Been Realized <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Due to the lack of scientific progress in our country and the lack of medical knowledge among the general public, people in lower society who suffer from tuberculosis attribute it to past karma, seeking gods and divination. As for those with a slightly more modern mindset, they mistakenly believe the previously circulated notion that there is no specific medicine for lung disease, and blindly trust doctors' treatments.</p>
<p>I am not saying that tuberculosis patients do not need doctors, but doctors are actually of little use to tuberculosis patients. Anyone who has stayed in a tuberculosis sanatorium knows that doctors are only consultants, not clinicians; because tuberculosis really relies entirely on recuperation!</p>
<p>Even the "collapse therapy" that has recently gained world status is limited to surgical treatment. Although surgical treatments for tuberculosis, such as artificial pneumothorax, rib resection, and nerve cutting, have definite effects, they cannot be used for every tuberculosis patient, so their scope of application is still not wide!</p>
<p>Based on this point, many scholars have long wanted to apply "collapse therapy" to oral medication. After countless experiments, they finally succeeded! This is the main reason why the medicine "Bufei Naer" is so popular for oral treatment of tuberculosis today.</p>
<p>The theory of "Bufei Naer" is based on the "collapse therapy" of pulmonary surgery, so taking it has the same effect as artificial pneumothorax. This preparation can reduce blood and lymphatic flow in the affected lung and reduce the oxygen supply to the lesion tissue, causing the tubercle bacilli to lose their activity and gradually disappear. Therefore, after taking it, night sweats disappear, hemoptysis stops, coughs and sputum become thinner, and night sweats and stomach problems gradually disappear. Therefore, this preparation is now widely popular in various countries! If taken in combination with the medicine "Butikon," it can better cure neurasthenia, insomnia, spermatorrhea, and other symptoms caused by tuberculosis!</p>
<h3 id="e137">Effective Countermeasures for Menstrual Disorders <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>The most difficult thing for women to deal with is menstrual disorders. Because menstruation is the controller of a woman's health and happiness throughout her life. If a woman's menstruation comes on time and there is no abdominal pain, back pain, headache, etc., this is physiological menstruation. Her ovarian function must also be healthy. Therefore, her ability to conceive is very strong. However, many women lose the healthy state of their uterus and ovaries due to early marriage and frequent sexual activity. As a result, all kinds of diseases arise. The most obvious is lower abdominal distension and pain during menstruation, or like needle pricks, the menstrual blood is dark or congealed into clots. This hinders blood circulation, reduces red blood cells, and causes the complexion to become sallow, presenting a state of anemia. The ability to conceive is further greatly affected. Therefore, the nerves also become weak, such as heavy head and blurred vision, mental depression, insomnia, forgetfulness, and depression. All of these are the root causes of menstrual disorders, and small breasts and incomplete development are also related to menstrual disorders. The medicine "Bunuyong" is the most effective treatment for adjusting menstrual disorders, because it adjusts menstruation, stimulates follicles, and strengthens nerves, so menstrual disorders are eradicated and neurasthenia is also gone. All diseases caused by menstrual irregularities can be cured. Therefore, the medicine "Bunuyong" is indeed an effective countermeasure for women's menstrual disorders. For those with leukorrhea, "Carter Schädler Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to clear the leukorrhea. This is what I have experienced since graduating from Nantong Medical University.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Salvation for Chronic Gonorrheal Vas Deferens Inflammation <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Shen Xueqing, 24 years old, contracted gonorrhea at the age of 21. Although he was treated repeatedly, he was still unable to eradicate it. It recurred and was treated repeatedly, but the toxic atmosphere inside was rampant, and it spread to the deep parts, causing dull pain in the lower abdomen and perineum. In the perineum, there was a rope-like protrusion. Severe pain occurred during ejaculation, and the urine was mixed with gonorrheal filaments during urination. Mr. Shen mistakenly believed in over-the-counter transmucosal sterilization medicines, and after taking them, the scope of the disease was enlarged. The testicles also felt swollen and painful, but not very severely. Later, due to the introduction of an old patient, Mr. Dai Shuyong, he came to me for treatment. I examined his semen under a 500x microscope and found many gonococci in the semen. However, sperm were very sparse (as shown in Figure 1). Most of them had been killed by the toxins. After careful examination, I knew that Mr. Shen's disease had indeed become vas deferens inflammation, and the adjacent organs such as the prostate and testicles had also developed inflammation. In addition to electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase "Kelinong" from Wing On Company to take orally for anti-inflammatory, sterilization, pain relief, and diuresis. On the other hand, he used "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" at home to wash the urethra according to the instructions. After only four weeks of self-treatment, he was cured, the inflammation was gone, and the urine was clear. I examined his semen again under a microscope, and the gonococci disappeared. Only sperm and pure semen remained (as shown in Figure 2).</p>
<h3 id="e139">(Figure 1) <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Before taking "Kelinong," gonococci were quite numerous in the semen. The dense areas are all gonococci, and the sperm are very few.</p>
<h3 id="e140">(Figure 2) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>After taking "Kelinong," there were no traces of gonococci in the semen. What was seen was only semen and sperm.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Suffering from the Husband's Burden—Leukorrhea <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>If a husband contracts gonorrhea, his wife suffers for life!</p>
<p>Women have more diseases than men, but many diseases are transmitted to them by men. For example, leukorrhea is already very common among women, but many husbands who like to indulge in pleasure contract gonorrhea and inject semen and gonococci together into the vagina and uterus during sexual intercourse, resulting in uterine and vaginal inflammation. The secreted leukorrhea contains severe toxicity, and occasionally touching the eyes can cause blindness, so women with gonorrheal leukorrhea often have blind newborns. The reason is here.</p>
<p>If we want to eliminate leukorrhea, we must of course eliminate gonorrhea. The most effective treatment is to take "Kelinong" orally to eliminate gonorrhea, and use "Carter Schädler Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories to wash away all the local gonorrheal leukorrhea. Because "Carter Schädler Vaginal Tablets" are rich in sterilization, antiseptic, and anti-secretion effects, they are an effective medicine for leukorrhea and can be used for secret self-treatment at home. However, for leukorrhea caused by menstrual disorders, in addition to using these tablets as suppositories, it is also appropriate to take "Bunuyong" to regulate menstruation for better results.</p>
<p>Readers' Forum</p>
<p>Gonorrheal Testicular Swelling</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Baikui from Hunan wrote: During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, I contracted gonorrhea due to visiting brothels. I have not been cured to this day. Every morning, the urethra is blocked by purulent filaments. First, the right testicle swelled, and then both sides swelled. Later, I saw in the newspaper that the protein and yellow pigment preparation "Kelinong" was very effective, so I bought and took three bottles, and I saw that urination was smooth and the testicular pain was greatly reduced. So I continued to take five bottles, and the testicular swelling also completely subsided. The effect of the good medicine is truly undeniable.</p>
<p>Milky Turbid Urine and Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Bingsan from Hankou wrote: I suffer from gonorrhea, and due to incompetent doctors and inferior medicines, it has been delayed until now. Milky turbid urine flows continuously, and there are many gonorrheal filaments in the urine. Every night, when the penis erects, there is spermatorrhea, with blood in the sperm, and pain during emission. Fortunately, I saw that my colleague Mr. Mao Qiwei took "Kelinong" to cure gonorrhea, so I went to the Sino-British Pharmacy to buy four bottles and took them continuously. Before the medicine was finished, the milky turbid urine cleared up and the spermatorrhea also stopped!</p>
<p>External Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. He Zhikang asked: I recently contracted gonorrhea, and there is a lot of pus flowing from the urethra, difficulty urinating, and white mucus. What are the good methods?</p>
<p>Answer: You can take "Kelinong" orally to produce anti-gonococcal antibodies to eliminate gonorrhea; and purchase "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" from Wing On or Taihe for external washing.</p>

<p>Periurethritis is mostly caused by gonorrhea soaking in the urethra, forming small nodules, which then turn into abscesses. These infiltrative diseases are generally located in the deep part of the urethral mucosa and the inner canal of the urethra, especially those that occur due to branching and complexity. Usually, it starts with rice-grain-sized to small-bean-sized, only gradually forming hardened small nodules, but due to repeated progressive minor inflammation, it presents an infiltrative state, with a tendency to form an abscess, and further destroys the outer skin or the inherent urethral mucosa, or simultaneously destroys both sides, forming the danger of a fistula. However, according to my years of practical observation, this disease is mostly due to gonococci in the abscess, or the result of secondary infection, and from the presence of other bacteria. Once suppurated or a fistula occurs, there is a danger of lifelong incurable or loss of sexual organ health. However, before this symptom forms, the external use of electrotherapy and "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" and the internal use of the protein-yellow pigment mixture "Kelinong" can quickly cure the disease.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tian Jiaxuan had intercourse with a female hostess in an entertainment venue, resulting in contracting gonorrhea. The treatment had not yet been completed, and he visited brothels again, resulting in severe gonorrhea, urethral swelling and pain, and severe inflammation. Urination was difficult and spasmodic pain occurred. Urine examination and endoscopic examination were performed, and there were indeed many small-bean-sized nodules in the urethra, inflamed and crimson. But fortunately, it had not suppurated. After applying long and short wave alternating treatments, he simultaneously took "Kelinong" invented by Mr. Peter of Germany, to sterilize, reduce inflammation, prevent rot, relieve pain, and diuretic, to prevent the urethral mucosa from rotting due to inflammation, and at the same time used "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" externally to sterilize, reduce inflammation, and eliminate the nodules. After applying it for five weeks, the pain in the urethra disappeared completely. The nodules of the small beans were indeed completely eliminated by re-examining with a urethral endoscope. The surrounding mucosa also returned to normal. This is the ironclad evidence of a radical cure for periurethritis. It is also the great achievement of "Kelinong" and "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" in defeating gonorrhea.</p>

<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, M.D. from Russia</p>
<p>The habit of masturbation, from the highest civilization all the way down to the most barbaric people, has become a deeply ingrained and unique bad habit of mankind, and the only consolation for young people and sexual perverts.</p>
<p>But who knows that this is the most poisonous habit for human race and society, medical scientists have long declared loudly to all mankind. In addition, excessive sexual activity is also harmful to health. Young people who marry early or are addicted to masturbation often end up suffering from spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission, which ultimately hinder sexual development and result in sexual organ dwarfism and physical weakness. He cannot win the wife's favor! Even if married, the erection will inevitably be weak, premature ejaculation, and even impotence, lacking humanity. When I was studying in Moscow, Russia, in order to promote the construction of strength, Soviet medical scientists mainly used lion, tiger, and sea dog testicles, sperm, youth glands, and other hormone preparations as the only holy product to produce strong young cadres. As a result, the medicine "Butikon", which contains lion, tiger, and sea dog hormones, became popular at once, and is still being taken in large quantities to this day. According to precise statistics, most people are transformed from weak to strong after taking it, developing strongly, and becoming sexually healthy, and all premature ejaculation and impotence are swept away! If you have spermatorrhea, you can also take "Niles Spermatorrhea Pills" at the same time, and the effect is extremely accurate! If you take "Butikon" in winter, you will not be afraid of the cold even in severe cold, and you can avoid the worry of frostbite!</p>

<p>The Shanghai University Sports Federation football championship game was held yesterday for the second time. The game between Fudan and Tongji was postponed because Fudan was rehearsing a play to support Suiyuan and because they were competing with Jinde for the Chinese Football League championship. Only the Guanghua vs. Jinan match was played at the Zhenru field. The strength of the two sides was evenly matched, and the battle was therefore tense. The defenses of both sides were as solid as a rock, with Guanghua being slightly better. Chen Zhijie sold his strength and saved many dangerous balls. However, Jinan had the advantage of home ground, so their offensive was stronger. But because their kicks were not hard enough, they fought for a long time without any gains. It wasn't until the last half-minute that Cai Jincai made a long shot outside the penalty line, which flew diagonally into the corner of the net, using this most precious goal to decide the outcome. Although Guanghua was unfortunately defeated, they had done their best. Now Jinan has won two games in a row and it will not be difficult to maintain its dominant position in the Jiangnan University League. However, their only strong opponent in this competition is Fudan. The two teams will meet in Zhenru next week, so let's see how they resolve it.</p>
<p>West Youth Basketball</p>
<h3 id="e148">Hujiang Defeats Chizhi; Result is 48 to 46; Tongji Defeats Nanyang 33 to 27 <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In the West Youth Basketball University Group, the Chizhi team, which defeated Fudan on the opening day, lost to Hujiang by two points last night. This match was one of the most intense in the University Group. From beginning to end, it was impossible to determine who would win or lose. Until the last minute, Hujiang's center Zhu Peisheng scored a goal, which determined Hujiang's victory with a score of 48 to 46. Tongji's victory over Nanyang was also an exciting game. Huangfeng's fight against Mailingjia was like hitting a stone with an egg, but in the first half, Huangfeng fought stubbornly and only lost by three points. A total of six games were played yesterday, with the following results:</p>
<p>Team's Win/Loss   Category    First Half  Total Result</p>
<p>Tongwen wins against Shuizhuan  Elementary  11 to 8   24 to 14</p>
<p>Shaguyu wins against Yonggan  Elementary  21 to 11  32 to 22</p>
<p>Jingwu wins against Shaonian  Elementary  15 to 10  27 to 24</p>
<p>Hujiang wins against Chizhi   University   29 to 27  48 to 46</p>
<p>Tongji wins against Nanyang   University   21 to 11  33 to 27</p>
<p>Mailingjia wins against Huangfeng Independent  16 to 13  46 to 20</p>
<p>Hujiang Defeats Chizhi</p>
<p>Hujiang's strength this year is mediocre. They have lost to Tongji and Fudan. Chizhi is indeed an emerging strong team, coming with a sound and color, having defeated famous teams such as Fudan and Nanyang Tongji, so it was predicted that Hujiang was not their enemy, and the difference was very big. Unexpectedly, Hujiang consolidated its defense, preventing Chizhi from doing whatever they wanted, creating a stalemate situation that was difficult to resolve. On the other hand, Chizhi was flustered, and their formation was shattered. During the game, Hujiang led all the way, and Chizhi never took the lead. The excitement of the situation was even greater than the battle between Xintong and the Xin team.</p>
<p>Hujiang's victory, in summary, was due to the successful long shot by defender Lu Zhongyu, which earned a huge score. He had six successful shots, scoring a total of 13 points. Qian Jingyong also scored six goals and made three free throws, scoring 15 points. Feng Yulai's five goals were even more icing on the cake.</p>
<p>On the Chizhi side, although Liang Yunming scored the highest record of 23 points alone, center Chen Xuechong only scored eight points, and Shu Yinghai only scored three points, which was the biggest loss.</p>
<p>In the first half, except for two ties at 18 to 18 and 27 to 27, Hujiang often took the lead by one or two points, but it was only one or two points. Because of Qian Jingyong's shot, the score became 29 to 27, and Hujiang won by two points in the first half.</p>
<p>The situation afterwards was the same as in the previous game, struggling hard. In the last three or four minutes, Hujiang led by five points with a score of 46 to 41. After Liang Yunming and Chen Xuechong each scored a goal, they were only one point behind again. Lu Zhongyu got a free throw but missed, and suddenly Zhang Liangxiong's free throw made the final tie of 46 to 46. At this time, there was only one minute of precious time left. The two sides were caught in a bitter battle, and the emotions of the audience reached a boiling point. Chizhi attacked with all their strength, but Zhu Peisheng dribbled to the basket and got a long ball from the back, calmly put it into the most glorious two points, making Chizhi submit. The score of 48 to 46 meant that there was no ever-victorious army in the University Group. The progress of the subsequent games will be even more intriguing.</p>

<p>Tongji Defeats Nanyang</p>
<p>The two teams are evenly matched, but their strengths are average, so the battle was quite tense. Both sides felt clumsy and their formations were chaotic, with few highlights. Tongji relied on Li Silin's planning and strategy, taking on the heavy responsibility of both offense and defense. His hard work and great contribution made him a true hero. His last three successful long shots resulted in the final victory. Although Tao Lian's skills were raw, if not for this man's good fortune, the situation might have changed. In the first half, Nanyang was not successful, lagging behind 3 to 14, and the final score was 21 to 11. In the second half, Nanyang had a new formation, with Liu Jingfeng transferred to center. The forwards had several beautiful passes, and the score jumped to 20 to 21, only one point behind Tongji, showing a new atmosphere. However, Li Silin made a long shot, which was indeed successful. Nanyang also did not show weakness, and Liu Cheng each made contributions, making the score 24 to 25 again. In the end, Tongji relied on Tao Chen's scores to defeat Nanyang with a final score of 33 to 27.</p>
<p>Tongji  Foul  Points</p>
<p>Luo Guangkai 0  2</p>
<p>Cao Yuqi  1  1</p>

<p>First Half Tongji 21 Nanyang 11</p>
<p>Second Half Tongji 12 Nanyang 16</p>
<p>Mailing Wins Against Huangfeng</p>
<p>Huangfeng's attacking power was reduced due to the absence of Zhang Wenyuan. Tao Shaosheng had some good plays. Dong Xiaopei dribbled too deep to the baseline, leaving no room to turn around, losing many opportunities. In the first half, the difference was as much as eight minutes, preventing Mailing from opening the scoring, while Huangfeng got four free throws, only scoring one point. Mailing's formation was very chaotic. Tou Fan's shots were mostly inaccurate. Le Ke was too fleshy and had lost his edge. The tight situation of 16 to 13 in the first half was no longer seen in the second half. In the end, the difference in physical strength and technique was too great.</p>
<p>The official recorder made many mistakes. Tao Shaosheng of Huangfeng committed three fouls, but it was mistakenly recorded as four, and the dispute lasted for a long time. The referee and the recorder insisted that there was no mistake. At Mailing's request, Tao was still allowed to continue playing, while Huang Huating committed a total of five fouls, but only three were recorded. By analogy, the record was unreliable. It is hoped that in the future, each team will send a competent recorder to correct the mistakes from the side.</p>
<p>In the first half of the game, Mailing led 12 to 7. No. 7 Pai Luosi accidentally scored a goal while saving the ball, causing a burst of laughter.</p>

<p>Minli Middle School The Minli Middle School in Danandou, Shanghai, celebrated its 30th anniversary on the 5th. Guests included Pan Gongzhan, Lu Jingshi, Li Hongyuan, Zhu Xuefan, and directors, students' families, and alumni, totaling several thousand. The ceremony began at 9 am, chaired by Su Yingjie. In his speech, he said that he was honored to have the directors, guests, and alumni of the school attend the 33rd anniversary of the founding of Minli Middle School. He would now report to everyone on the school's educational situation over the past 33 years, hoping that everyone would be happy to hear it. Thinking back to the founding of Minli, it has gone through hardships without being destroyed. All the credit goes to Mr. Shen Jinqing and his late brother Su Junshang for their joint efforts, and the directors' enthusiasm for education. Therefore, on the occasion of today's celebration, we cannot help but miss and remember them, and we will redouble our efforts. We hope that the directors will continue to assist the teachers and that the students will also work hard to encourage themselves. Then, Pan Gongzhan gave instructions, saying that your school is the most famous private middle school in Shanghai, with a long history and excellent teaching, and it is a model of hope among middle schools. However, in the face of national crisis, our students must work hard, and once they have completed their studies, they can serve the country. We must know that today's China, although dangerous on the surface, is stable in its heart. As long as the whole country unites as one, why worry about the national crisis? I hope that all students will encourage themselves. Then, representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Lu Jingshi, and school director Zhu Xuefan, gave speeches. Finally, Secretary-General Zhao Shusheng gave a thank-you speech. In the afternoon, there was an exhibition and entertainment.</p>

<p>— Gu Jingqun</p>
<p>Children! I think you have all seen the news in the newspapers recently about the rampant bandits and traitors invading our borders and attacking Suiyuan, and the news of them opening fire with the garrison! After seeing this, will we once think about the advantages and disadvantages of it? We must know that Suiyuan is the first line of defense for our country, and the gain or loss of Suiyuan is a key to the life and death of our Republic of China, so we must pay close attention to it and not ignore it. We have also seen the soldiers at the front of Suiyuan, who are full of boiling blood, bravely fighting in the freezing weather to defend the country's territory, and resolutely not losing an inch of land to the enemy. This spirit is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Now all sectors of Shanghai are enthusiastically donating money and sending it to Suiyuan to provide material assistance to comfort our loyal and brave soldiers who are seeking survival for the country and the nation! Children! We are also part of the citizens of the Republic of China, and we must also fulfill our national duty. We must save money from various expenses such as candy, toys, and snacks, and donate it to the Suiyuan soldiers who are serving the country. Although the money saved by one person is very limited, I believe that if we calculate the money saved by children all over the country, there will definitely be a huge sum of money, enough to give the Suiyuan soldiers great material assistance. Therefore, I hope that children all over the country will unite and contribute to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The War in Suiyuan Expands <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Shouqiu</p>
<p>Children, do you know? The war in Suiyuan is expanding! Our four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have been occupied by the enemy for five years! Now they are coming to seize our Suiyuan Province again! Suiyuan is very important in terms of its terrain. If it is lost, the northwestern provinces will all belong to others. In this situation, what should we do, children? I think: the answer of all the children must be "We must defend our Suiyuan, and we will fight with them!" That's right, that's what everyone means. Now Fu Zuoyi, who is defending Suiyuan, has already fought with them. They have attacked several times, but we have repelled them all. However, the weather is already cold, and Suiyuan is much colder than our Jiangnan. Those soldiers fighting have no fur coats to wear, and all they eat are cold cakes and cold cornbread. This seems too unfair to our patriotic soldiers. Therefore, recently many people have taken out money to donate to them to buy clothes and food. Shanghai has also launched a one-coin movement for elementary school students, which is to save one copper coin every day to comfort the Suiyuan soldiers. Children with patriotism naturally agree with this method. However, I hope that all of you children, in addition to the one-coin movement, save a few more copper coins every day, or ask your parents to donate more. Those who can donate one dollar should donate one dollar; those who can donate ten cents should donate ten cents. In this way, you will be showing that you are good patriotic children, and you will be worthy of the patriotic soldiers who are serving at the front.</p>

<p>One wave rises again before the last one has settled. Everyone quiet down, think carefully, how much more land do we have to give to the enemy to trample?</p>
<p>Dring-a-ling... Dring-a-ling...</p>
<p>Suiyuan is full of puppet bandits and enemy soldiers,</p>
<p>We don't need X-rays to examine their hearts,</p>
<p>We also know that they won't stop until they have seized all of our land.</p>
<p>Dring-a-ling... Dring-a-ling...</p>
<p>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up quickly!</p>
<p>If we want to survive in the future, we must annihilate the enemy soldiers,</p>
<p>We must carry out the spirit of our united efforts.</p>

<p>— Qian Zhongzheng</p>
<p>Mother:</p>
<p>I reluctantly suppressed my infinite sorrow and passion to write this farewell letter to you.</p>
<p>I am now on the front lines of the battlefield. I have no other thoughts. In my mind, there is only the thought of sacrificing for the country. I dare not even think of you. If I think of your kindness and your greatness, I am afraid it will reduce my spirit to kill the enemy. Although the people who die for the country are very regrettable, they are sacrificing for justice and fairness, so it is not a waste to die.</p>
<p>I have forgotten what you said to me at the farewell. All I remember is: "I hope you die on the battlefield, don't die at home, and I don't want to see you before the enemy soldiers are driven back." I can't remember the other words. The words I remember are those that can make me strive forward bravely, repel the enemy, and prepare to see you, my great and kind mother, and receive your kiss and embrace. I want to receive your kiss and embrace immediately, so I have to repel this enemy immediately.</p>
<p>Mother! I hope you become the greatest patriotic mother in China, and I hope other people's mothers are like you too. Mother! You don't have to be sad. Mr. Wen Tianxiang once said, "Who has not died since ancient times, but let my loyal heart shine in history!" It's just a matter of dying sooner or later. You don't have to think that you will never see your lively and lovely son again. As Mr. Lin Juemin said, "Living in today's era, thieves can die, corrupt officials who abuse the people can die, and living in today's China, there is no place where one cannot die. It is better to die for the sake of fighting for national survival!"</p>
<p>Mother! Don't be sad that you don't have a son. I didn't believe in ghosts originally, but now I really hope there are ghosts after death. I hope this is reliable, so that you can still see your lively son, and you won't be sad!</p>
<p>Now the bugle has sounded, and we are about to proceed. Goodbye! Kind mother! Finally, I have to call out again: "Long live the Republic of China! Long live the Republic of China!"</p>

<p>— Mao Shenshi, Sixth Grade, Chongshi Elementary School</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder day by day! Especially in Suiyuan, it is reported that there is already heavy snow and thick ice! But let us consider: at a time when bandits, puppet regimes, and enemies are invading the borders of Suiyuan, it is already difficult enough for the soldiers on the front lines to resist bravely while suffering from hunger and cold! How much more suffering must they endure in the harsh winter snow?</p>
<p>Children! Let us also consider: our compatriots in the war zone, men, women, old, and young alike, are forced to flee from place to place to avoid disaster due to the unrest and harassment caused by bandits and puppet regimes. They have left their homes and are suffering from hunger and cold, wandering in the desolate fields. At the same time, you can imagine thousands of innocent children, just like you, starving and freezing in the war zone. Children! Can we bear to let these beloved compatriots suffer? Freeze to death? Surely not!</p>
<p>In order to help our brave warriors fighting and the innocent compatriots who are suffering, I am initiating a clothing drive to support Suiyuan. Please ask your mothers if they have any discarded, old, or even spare cotton clothes and trousers, and collect them. Furthermore, gather three or five small comrades and try your best to solicit donations from all quarters, regardless of gender, age, clothing, hats, shoes, and socks, and send them to Suiyuan. I believe that although our strength is small, it will be of some benefit to the soldiers and those in distress! Dear children, let's get up and complete this clothing drive relief effort for Suiyuan!</p>
<h3 id="e168">A Necessary Understanding of Suiyuan <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>As Suiyuan is being invaded by bandits, puppet regimes, and enemies, I believe that children should have at least the following knowledge of Suiyuan: Suiyuan, together with Rehe and Chahar, is known as Inner Mongolia. It was designated as a special region in the third year of the Republic of China (1914) and reorganized as a province in September of the seventeenth year (1928). It governs seventeen counties, two administrative bureaus, and two leagues (thirteen banners, five gentry and one general administrator). The provincial capital is Guisui.</p>
<p>The total area of Suiyuan is 304,058 square kilometers. The total population is 1,805,799.</p>
<p>Suiyuan's products: Animals are mostly oxen, horses, sheep, mules, and camels, with leather and wool being the main exports. Plants are mostly grains, timber, and medicinal materials. Minerals are mostly coal and iron, with silver, aluminum, oil, salt, and soda also available. Handicrafts are mostly woolen and leather products and felt carpets.</p>
<p>Suiyuan transportation: The railway includes the Fenggui section and the Suibao section of the Ping-Sui Railway. The two sections are more than 739 li long in total. There are 602 kilometers of completed highways. Telecommunications: Wired telegraph, wireless telegraph, long-distance telephone, etc. are all available. There are more than 60 post offices. Aviation: Airports are located in Guisui and Baotou.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Of all the rivers in the world, the Yellow River is the richest." The Yellow River's backset is entirely within Suiyuan. These areas have fertile land and vast fields, making them ideal for cultivation.</p>
<p>Children! The enemies have coveted these resources for a long time. If we do not rise up to defend our territory and preserve our resources, the consequences will be unimaginable!</p>
<h3 id="e169">Suiyuan and Chairman Fu <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhu Guang)</p>
<p>Children, the "Sui" in Suiyuan means stability, and "Yuan" means far and near. Combining them, it means being stable and far away. However, we thought it was stable and far away for a long time, and we didn't pay attention to it, so it was expected that thieves would come to spy on it. But those thieves were unlucky and ran into a nail, but they ran into our teacher "Fu". He is a chairman who is "capable" and doesn't give way, and sees "righteousness" and acts bravely. Therefore, when the thieves came to spy on him, he decided to give them a head-on blow, which was also expected.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Let's Quickly Organize a Donation Team to Support Suiyuan <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Hey! Dear children across the country! Can you hear the rumbling of cannons? The "bang, bang, bang!" of gunfire? In the past few days, bandits and puppet regimes, relying on the power of a certain party, have been using airplanes, cannons, and tanks to invade Suiyuan, the front line of our national defense. Fortunately, the loyal and brave General Fu Zuoyi is leading his strong men to fight the enemy in the continuous snow and ice. How gratifying and admirable this is! Every day, the newspapers are filled with alarming words, awakening the general public who are living in a drunken stupor. We children should all know how dangerous Suiyuan, the northern gateway, is now! Even in the south, thousands of miles away, we should be as frightened as if we heard the sound of gunfire!</p>
<p>Children! Our soldiers on the front lines of Suidong and Subei are holding on to an indomitable spirit of fearlessness and are fighting the enemy to the death. Therefore, the bandit and puppet troops cannot invade an inch of Sui territory. How can we not heavily comfort them? It is winter now, and the weather there is extremely cold. Our loyal and brave soldiers! They are suffering from hunger and cold. We, the warm and well-fed people of the south, ask ourselves, who can be at ease? Can we sit idly by and watch our compatriots in Suiyuan be slaughtered? We should not think that Suiyuan, thousands of miles away, has little to do with us, and has nothing to do with us. We must know that Suiyuan is called the front line of national defense, and its importance is self-evident. If it is lost, I dare say that the north will be finished. The entire national defense center, the entire national barrier, will be irreparable. I am afraid that in the near future, we will face a great disaster, and the entire country will be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Children! The gain or loss of Suiyuan is closely related to the rise and fall of the entire country, and it is also the time for our last struggle for survival! Therefore, with twelve points of sincerity, I call out to all the dear little brothers and sisters in the country: "Let's quickly organize a donation team to support Suiyuan!" I think you will all accept my request! I hope that our 400 million compatriots will do what they can to donate money to the front lines to comfort our loyal and brave soldiers who are fighting the enemy, so that they will not suffer from hunger and cold, and give them material and spiritual assistance, so that they can fight the enemy with peace of mind. Then, Suiyuan will not be lost, and the entire national barrier will not be shaken. Okay! Okay! Let's quickly organize a donation team and set off to the nearby villages, towns, and counties to collect large sums of money and remit them to the Shenbao newspaper as a comfort fund for the soldiers on the front lines of Suiyuan. Children! Let's lead our 200 million young compatriots! Quickly organize a donation team to support Suiyuan!</p>
<h3 id="e171">Please Children, "One More Time" <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Weisheng</p>
<p>Children, the news of the "bandit and puppet invasion of Suiyuan" must have been seen in the newspapers by everyone. If it weren't for Chairman Fu Zuoyi's "death pledge" to resist the war and defend the country, the consequences would have been unimaginable!</p>
<p>However, resisting the enemy is not just empty talk. There must be sufficient "strength" and a steady stream of supplies to be sustained.</p>
<p>I remember that during the "September 18th Incident" when General Ma Zhanshan resisted the enemy, you did save a lot of candy money to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army as military pay. To this day, people still often mention this and praise your good deeds. For the present plan, needless to say, it is "one more time". Save the candy money as usual and donate it to the "soldiers on the front lines", which is easier. Fortunately, candy is just a snack, so you can eat less of it. If one person donates ten cents, one hundred people will make ten yuan, and ten thousand people will make one thousand yuan. That amount is really not small!</p>
<p>Children! Please everyone, "one more time"!</p>
<h3 id="e172">Filial Piety (7) <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Finally, a solution came to mind. One of the coachmen said, "Let's take turns lending him our leather coats, or just let him wear it all the way, and we'll switch every mile," he suggested, and everyone agreed. Immediately, one of the coachmen took off his sheepskin coat and put it on Boskoffy carefully, while he wrapped himself in the cargo cloth, curled up his feet underneath him, and sang even louder. Every time they saw a milestone, they would have to take off the sheepskin coat and have a happy chat while changing clothes. Along the way, Boskoffy prayed silently that they would not harm their health because of this.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the inn in Yekaterinburg, the hostess of the inn told her about several philanthropists in the town, and especially praised Madam Millin, saying that she was charitable and everyone knew it. She asked Boskoffy to see this madam tomorrow to discuss how to proceed. It just so happened that the next day was Sunday, so Boskoffy hurried to church. Her devout prayer and the tattered travel clothes she wore attracted people's attention. As she walked out of the church, a lady asked her name. Boskoffy told her the name and asked her to point out where Madam Millin lived, and said that the madam's charity was well known. The lady said to her, "I'm afraid Madam Millin's charity is a bit too much; you might as well come with me and let me take care of you."</p>
<p>Boskoffy didn't like to hear this kind of disparaging remark about Madam Millin, so the lady quickly pointed out where Madam Millin lived, and told her that if she was refused, she could go to her. Boskoffy didn't answer and walked to Madam Millin's door to ask the servants if the madam was home. The servants looked at their mistress in surprise. It turned out that the lady who was talking to her was Madam Millin herself.</p>
<p>This charitable madam left her at home and treated her as a guest. She stayed there for a whole winter and tried her best to heal the frostbite she had suffered in the wind and snow that night. At the same time, she gave Boskoffy a general education. Since her father was exiled to Siberia, Boskoffy had almost forgotten how to read and write. Now she began to read, draw, and write again. Every time she talked about Madam Millin's charity, she couldn't help but shed tears of gratitude. But while she was living comfortably, she felt even more uncomfortable when she thought of her parents suffering in the snow and ice. However, Madam Millin refused to let her leave Yekaterinburg until the spring of the following year, when she bought her a seat on a flat-bottomed boat on the Kama River and entrusted the people on the boat to take good care of her. This person was carrying a boatload of iron and salt to Nizhny Novgorod.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this person suddenly fell ill and had to stay in a small village on the Kama River. So Boskoffy set off alone again without anyone to look after her.</p>

<h3 id="e173">After the Formation of the German-Italian-Japanese Bloc <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong He</p>
<p>Recently, there have been two issues of international concern that have shocked the world, namely the successive establishment of the German-Japanese and Italian-Japanese agreements. The establishment of these two agreements not only shows that the relationship between Western aggressors and Japan is closer, but also shows that the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have formed a bloc. Although Italy has not yet joined the German-Japanese agreement, and Germany has no direct relationship with the Italian-Japanese agreement, and the three countries of Italy, Germany, and Japan have not yet openly signed a treaty of alliance, judging from the national conditions of these three countries and their foreign policies, judging from the nature of the two agreements they recently established, they are standing on the same front in some respects. The formation of this bloc's front is certainly not for so-called "self-defense," because Germany, Italy, and Japan are all so-called powerful countries. Their territories have never been plundered, and their internal affairs have not been interfered with. There is no basis for raising the so-called "self-defense" issue. As for jointly defending against the development of any ideology, that is a matter of domestic thought and does not require any agreement to deal with it. If we are not deceived by those international diplomatic articles, then we can point out that the actual intention of Germany and Japan and Italy and Japan in establishing agreements is to mutually recognize "faits accomplis," jointly defend the lands they have seized, and work together to invade weak nations and attack world peace. We see that Article 1 of the German-Japanese agreement does not already hint that they want to force countries threatened by some force to surrender to them? Does not Article 3 of the attached protocol stipulate that they should establish a standing committee to deal with everything? What is the meaning of these? All those who love peace and respect their own country's sovereignty fully understand this. If we say that because of the establishment of the Italian-Japanese agreement, Japan thereby recognizes Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, then the meaning is even clearer; no one can say that it is for so-called "self-defense" and "peace."</p>
<p>Japan's recent actions in the Far East have been surprising enough; now that it has the assistance of the two Western countries, Italy and Germany, it is certainly "like a tiger with wings," and it will continue to make more serious demonstrations. Hitler and Mussolini are both world-renowned "eccentrics" and the greatest enemies of peace. In the past, they have fired many cannons, torn up many international treaties, and insulted and trampled on the weak nations and oppressed people of the world, and even general liberals. Now that they have Japan in the East to support them, it will certainly prompt them to attack the peace forces of the world even more. Originally, "birds of a feather flock together," and it is not surprising that the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan form a bloc, but from then on, the security of Europe and the Pacific, the peace of the world, and the fate of weak nations and the generally oppressed will be threatened even more powerfully; in the past, their acts of aggression were individual, but now they have become more organized and planned collective actions.</p>
<p>Taking the countries of the world as a whole, the most threatened by the formation of the German-Italian-Japanese bloc is, of course, the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union's social system is fundamentally different from theirs, and the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy is also in contradiction with their aggressive actions, and they are opposed to each other in all respects. In addition to the Soviet Union, the major powers such as Britain, the United States, and France are also under their serious threat. As for weak nations such as China, they have even more keenly felt the increase in the forces of aggression. Let's take Britain first.</p>
<p>After the German-Japanese agreement was announced, political circles in London expressed alarm and suspicion. At the same time, the "Standard Evening News" also reported that the German-Japanese agreement was attached with secret conditions, the main points of which were: "(1) The Dutch East Indies shall be divided into spheres of influence for Germany and Japan, and (2) Resolve the issue of Germany's pre-war possessions in the Pacific Islands." In other words, Borneo and Celebes in the Dutch East Indies are to be used as Japan's sphere of influence, while Sumatra and Java are to be used as Germany's sphere of influence; at the same time, Germany declares that it will abandon all rights to the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands (currently under Japanese mandate) that it owned in the Pacific before the war. If this is true, then Japan's southward advance will be even more convenient, and thus Britain's rights in Southeast Asia, and even in India and Burma, and in the entire Pacific will be threatened even more. Even if these private conditions are completely "rumors," because of the assistance of Germany and Italy, Japan's power in China (the country) and in the Pacific will also expand significantly, and Britain's security in the East will also be very problematic. At the same time, Britain is currently arguing with Italy in the Mediterranean, while Tokyo and Rome are staging a duet: Italy is befriending Japan, and Japan has also recognized Abyssinia as Italian territory, which is also something that Britain is not happy about; although Mussolini is unwilling to join the German-Japanese agreement in order to establish a Mediterranean "gentleman's agreement" with Britain, in London's view, the two enemies in the East and West are gathering together and getting hot, which is always unfavorable to it. Therefore, both the German-Japanese and Italian-Japanese agreements are opposed by London; this can be seen not only in the media, but also in the statements of government officials. However, Hitler stubbornly refused to understand, and he even ordered the German ambassador to Britain to inquire whether Baldwin could join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, which resulted in a hard snub. The cunning old fox Baldwin actually flatly refused to consider the question he raised.</p>
<p>Although the United States is farther away from the Far East and has repeatedly stated that it is unwilling to interfere in European affairs, the large-scale gathering of aggressive forces and the growth of Japanese power in the Pacific are also things that Washington is unwilling to hear. Therefore, after the news of the establishment of the German-Japanese and Italian-Japanese agreements was released, although the United States expressed a consistent "neutral attitude," it still paid close attention to the new situation of the German-Italian-Japanese bloc and deeply felt the great threat to world peace; as for the American media, it expressed its opposition even more clearly.</p>
<p>France is also greatly threatened by the German-Italian-Japanese group. In recent years, Hitler's risky actions to undermine international treaties have long made France feel its own security problems; for this reason, Paris has signed a treaty with the Soviet Union, which promotes a policy of peace, and is actively wooing Britain to prevent the development of aggressive forces. At that time, Hitler also expressed great indignation, saying that the peaceful group was dangerous to peace, and used this pretext to tear up international treaties again and erect cannons on the banks of the Rhine River aimed at Paris. But what about now? Hitler himself has also formed a bloc with Italy and Japan, preparing to attack the Soviet Union, the signatory of the Franco-Soviet agreement, in the East, threatening peace in the Pacific, and directly threatening France's security in the West. Now, Hitler and Mussolini have openly divided Central Europe into their spheres of influence, treating Czechoslovakia and Austria as targets of German aggression, and counting Hungary and Yugoslavia as areas of Italian aggression. This not only makes the small countries of Central Europe feel their own survival problems, but France also has to feel greatly uneasy, because the small countries of Central Europe are France's barrier. Therefore, after the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese group, the French authorities immediately took "preventive measures" to ensure the security of Europe; and the Paris newspapers unanimously opposed it, and called on the French people to rise up to defend world peace.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can see that on the one hand, there is a large-scale gathering of aggressive forces, threatening world peace and the security of all countries, and on the other hand, there is the opposition and defense of many countries in the world to aggressionism. In today's world, it is "if the devil is one foot tall, the way is also one foot tall." As the forces that undermine peace develop, the forces that defend peace are also developing; otherwise, the cruel god of war would have already descended on the world. Look, regarding the gathering of aggressive forces, France, the Soviet Union, and China have expressed their firm opposition, and Britain and the United States have also expressed that they will not support them. Even Poland and Austria, which have always followed behind Hitler and Mussolini, are unwilling to join their group. These are all concrete answers to the aggressors. Of course, we cannot say that world peace has been guaranteed, and that the liberation of weak nations has had more favorable conditions. On the contrary, due to the establishment of the aggressive group, the war crisis is even more imminent, and the liberation of weak nations has increased some difficulties, but the aggressive forces want to win, I am afraid that it is just an illusion.</p>

<h3 id="e174">A Sketch of Aid-Sui Movements in Various Circles of This City <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Hong</p>
<p>"Aid Sui!" This clamor, like the cannons of "January 28th," shook everyone's eardrums in Shanghai. At the same time, there was a widespread resonance across the country, making Shanghai, which had been silent for a very long time, seem to hold up countless torches in the still night. The author, unable to march to northern Henan and personally witness the scenes of beacon fires and the courageous fight against the enemy to save the country, felt that the light of these torches already raised in this city was no less than the beacon fires on the front lines.</p>
<p>"Those with money, give money!" Under this call, we saw many well-dressed people gathering in their offices, writing rooms, and clubs, three or five, eight or ten at a time, to discuss. Some responded to the "One-Day Movement," declaring to the accountant that they were willing to donate a full day's salary each month, contributing their bit to the cause and sending it to aid Sui. This included public and clerical staff, business managers and employees, and so on. After these discussions, they would prepare a large sheet of white paper with the following words written on it:</p>
<p>"The national Aid Sui movement should be unified! We are also part of the Chinese nation, and we dare not lag behind others in loving our country. Therefore, after discussions among several people, we will donate one day's income from each person's monthly salary. Every little helps, and we will send it to the front lines. Please sign your names!"</p>
<p>Below this, we could see many names. Some were written with ink brushes, some with fountain pens, and some with pencils. But all were signed very quickly and smoothly, expressing a willing attitude on the surface of the words.</p>
<p>I left the well-dressed people and went out into the streets. Although the north wind was howling and the cold air was biting, the Boy Scouts, who were not seeking fame or profit and braving the cold wind, were already active in the streets, urging people to donate. Several Girl Scouts walked up to me, their hands already frozen purple. Their voices were trembling, and their bodies were shivering. They said in unison:</p>
<p>"Sir! The weather is very cold today, isn't it? The soldiers in northern Sui, who are in ice and snow ten times colder than Shanghai, need our help even more!"</p>
<p>The short sentences stung my heart. I fumbled in my warm inner pocket for a small banknote and handed it to them with shame. Accidentally touching an ice-cold palm made me feel an unusual excitement!</p>
<p>In other places, I saw some Boy Scouts walking past one or two poorly dressed laborers. They did not ask them for money. But the two laborers each voluntarily took out a dozen copper coins and gave them to them, saying:</p>
<p>"This is a good thing! Thank you for your hard work. I'll donate a little too!"</p>
<p>This was in the so-called factory area. I visited a familiar factory. It was not possible to move freely here, but because I had a good relationship with the manager and administrators, once I entered the door, I could run around as I pleased. In a workshop where people were working hard and taking breaks to chat, I saw most of the workers looking pale and malnourished. One talkative person was broadcasting news:</p>
<p>"Fighting the bandit army is just like fighting ××, isn't it? It's really great! Everyone is donating money again like during 'January 28th'! There was a place where prisoners even went hungry for a day and used that as a donation!"</p>
<p>"Let's donate some too!" Several people said in unison.</p>
<p>"The labor union has already discussed a plan!" someone reminded.</p>
<p>"Let them deduct a little from our wages or savings!"</p>
<p>"Deduct from savings! We might as well ask them to deduct a good amount!"</p>
<p>"The more people there are, the better it will look! It will always amount to hundreds and thousands!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" A burst of self-comforting laughter.</p>
<p>At this time, I also joined in with a wry smile, and then I went elsewhere.</p>
<p>This was a certain girls' middle school that first initiated the donation of silk cotton vests. I followed a photographer in. The place where they were making cotton clothes was the self-study classroom. The sound of scissors and whispers echoed each other. Suddenly, when we walked in, we heard them humming the graduation song of "Tao Li Jie" and the "March of the Volunteers":</p>
<p>"Compatriots, rise up and take on the responsibility of the rise and fall of the world!"</p>
<p>"People who do not want to be slaves! Rise up! Advance in the face of the enemy's artillery fire!"</p>
<p>The heavy air solidified everyone's spirit into serious work. Everyone was burying themselves in sewing. On a wooden table that resembled a large dining table, several finished silk cotton vests had already been piled up. They felt very soft to the touch. The outer fabric was patriotic cloth, and the lining was plain cloth, roughly two feet four or five inches long. These were prepared to be worn inside military uniforms and tucked into military trousers. It was imagined that they must be warm and practical.</p>
<p>"The maiden's hand sews the thread, the warrior wears the clothes!"</p>
<p>They were truly practicing: "Peace, struggle, save China!"</p>
<p>Wherever you go to inquire: whether it is gentle,激烈的, excited, calm... everyone is doing their best, donating enthusiastically, and finding ways to raise funds. The newspapers show news of the aid Sui groups every day; the notice boards of factories and shops are posted with news of the aid Sui activities; the school's wall newspaper is brilliant with large characters. Statements from the literary world donating manuscript fees for paintings and calligraphy; student composition topics; one of the reasons for store sales; film merchants, dance halls, taverns, and restaurants are all encouraging and calling for this!</p>
<p>It is as if Shanghai, with its paper drunkeness and gold-digging, has put on a gas mask of national salvation movement! Ah, the great and enthusiastic aid Sui movement!</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Problem of the Elimination of Philosophy <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>"Philosophy not only explains the world, but also changes the world." Someone also said, "Once a new philosophy grasps the masses, it becomes the spiritual weapon of the masses." From this point of view, philosophy is very important now. Moreover, philosophy has a history of thousands of years, and now, not only has it not found its demise, but it has unfolded a brand-new world. From the past and present status of philosophy, it seems that it will not be eliminated in the near future.</p>
<p>But there are also people there advocating the theory of the elimination of philosophy. Some oppose philosophy from the standpoint of natural scientists. This point has already been discussed. Natural researchers always believe that as long as they despise philosophy and scold philosophy, they can be liberated from the constant presence of philosophy. But they do not think, and cannot move forward even one step. And for this thinking, theoretical provisions are necessary." So philosophy is still necessary. There are also some philosophers who abolish philosophy from their own standpoint. In Soviet Russia, there are Stepanov et al. In China, this issue is also raging fiercely. Therefore, we have the necessity to bring it up for discussion.</p>
<p>Since some people advocate the theory of the elimination of philosophy, there will naturally be many people who oppose this view, saying that philosophy will not be eliminated. Those who oppose philosophy from the standpoint of natural scientists, their reasons are completely mechanical and naive materialist views, which have already been refuted, and there is no need to repeat them here. As for those who advocate the elimination of philosophy from the standpoint of philosophers, the reasons they hold and the reasons held by those who refute them must be introduced. Here we can divide it into two aspects. The first point is theoretical, and the second point is textual. Of course, their theoretical basis also stems from the documents they understand, but in addition to the documents they cite, they always have their own logic. So it can be roughly divided into two aspects. Of course, both factions claim to be standing on the standpoint of new philosophy, and the documents on which they are based are also common.</p>
<p>We will now first examine the textual aspect:</p>
<p>The documents on which those who advocate the elimination of philosophy are based are as follows: "Philosophy generally ends with Hegel, on the one hand because he summarized the entire development on a large scale into his system, and on the other hand he, even unconsciously, actually pointed out to us the true path to reach the positiveness of the world outside the labyrinth of the system" (Engels, Anti-Dühring). "Modern materialism is not simply a reappearance of old materialism, but adds the entire ideological content of two thousand years of philosophy, natural science, and the development of two thousand years of history itself to the solid foundation of materialism. Generally speaking, this is no longer philosophy, but a pure worldview, which should not find its proof on some special branch of science, but on real science, and express its function. In this way, philosophy is "sublated," formally overcome, but retained in actual content" (Ibid.).</p>
<p>Based on the above grounds, those who advocate the elimination of philosophy conclude that this is the "end of philosophy."</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who oppose him cited many documents: "After understanding the results of the philosophical development of the past fifteen hundred years, natural science, on the one hand, can get rid of the special natural philosophy that is separate from it and above it, and on the other hand, can get rid of its own narrow way of thinking transmitted from English experience" (Anti-Dühring). "After philosophy is driven out of the natural world and history, only one area remains for it to place itself. This area is pure thought: the theory of studying the laws of thought - logic and dialectics" (Religion, Philosophy, and Socialism). "When natural science and historical science adopt dialectics in them, all the waste of philosophy - except for the theory of pure thought - begins to become superfluous and disappears into empirical science" (Collected Letters, Volume 4).</p>
<p>Based on the above, the opponents concluded that the philosophy eliminated by Engels was natural philosophy and historical philosophy, the old philosophy that was independent of science and above science, and that "logic and dialectics" were still not eliminated.</p>
<p>This is the textual argument between the two factions.</p>
<p>Let us look at the reasons held by the two from a theoretical point of view:</p>
<p>Those who advocate the elimination of philosophy believe that everything is in motion and change, everything has its birth, development, and death, so philosophy also has its death and elimination. Ever since philosophy became independent from religion, it denied religion; now that science is independent from philosophy, science will deny philosophy, and philosophy will be eliminated.</p>
<p>The opponents say: As science develops, philosophy will naturally be negated, but what is negated is the old philosophy in philosophy, such as natural philosophy and historical philosophy, not all of philosophy, including dialectical materialism - "logic and dialectics." So philosophy has not been eliminated. Moreover, dialectics is the general law of motion of nature, society, and thought, while science is the study of the laws of parts of the universe, so science still needs philosophy to guide and summarize it, and science cannot replace philosophy.</p>
<p>At the same time, according to the meaning of those who advocate the elimination of philosophy, the philosophy that he eliminates, the philosophy that he believes should eliminate itself, is only "old philosophy," "philosophical philosophy," while the dialectical materialism of new philosophy - "scientific philosophy" - is not in the list of elimination.</p>
<p>Then aren't the claims of these two factions going to reach the same conclusion in the end? Both say that the philosophy that is eliminated is old philosophy, idealistic philosophy, natural philosophy, historical philosophy, or "philosophical philosophy," while "scientific philosophy" is not eliminated, and no one attempts to, and no one can, eliminate it. In this way, the argument between these two seems to be just an argument over names, and it is only an argument over the scope of the meaning of the term philosophy. According to the former, the elimination of old philosophy is regarded as the elimination of the entire philosophy, hence the theory of the elimination of philosophy: in the latter, it is necessary to say separately that the elimination of old philosophy is not the elimination of the entire philosophy. This can be fully seen in the recent arguments between the two factions. That is, according to the meaning of nouns. In the theory of philosophical extinction, dialectical materialism is no longer philosophy, but has really become the theory of science. As a result, the term philosophy has generally lost its meaning of existence, and only science exists. On the other hand, opponents believe that the dialectical materialism is not science, but although it is a "scientific" philosophy, it is still philosophy, but it is different from "unscientific" philosophy. And now science still needs this new philosophy, which is not separate from science and does not stand above science, to guide it. So philosophy still exists.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate philosophy, those who advocate the elimination of philosophy have established a science of thinking, believing that the only territory that philosophy can retain - pure thought - can also be the field of science. In this way, philosophy has no place to stand. But at the same time, some people oppose the establishment of a science of thinking, and some people believe that science is the study of general laws of movement, so whether the science of thinking can be established has nothing to do with whether philosophy will be eliminated.</p>
<p>From the above, the question of whether philosophy is eliminated can be said to be an unresolved question. We hope that all philosophy researchers will enthusiastically participate in this debate and demonstrate from the textual and theoretical perspectives. At the same time, we also hope that the question of the establishment of a science of thinking, and the question of whether the establishment of a science of thinking and philosophy will be eliminated, will be studied together.</p>
<p>Also, in the Chinese philosophical community, the question of whether idealism and materialism can be synthesized is now also very fierce. What we want to say here is that this question is also related to the question of philosophical elimination. Because those who advocate that the two can be synthesized say that the history of philosophy is the reason why philosophy can become philosophy, because there is the contradiction and struggle between idealism and materialism, and philosophy is the product of this contradiction and opposition. If these two opposing things are unified, then the debate will disappear, and thus philosophy will also disappear. But whether these two can be unified, and whether the unification of these two will eliminate philosophy, is still a question to be studied. This also needs to be merged into the previous item for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Nurse Miss <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Rong</p>
<p>The first day of work gave me the impression that, apart from the suffocating smell of medicine, it surprisingly felt no different from the factory life two years ago. If I had to find its difference, it would only be the difference in address. Before, when working, people would call my name, but now, as a nurse, I have been changed to "Miss." The so-called Miss is just a little foreign. If it is really a lady from a boudoir, who would be willing to do those dirty things for patients, even the lowest-level things have to be done! From 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., we have no free time to rest during these twelve hours. For example, I work in the examination room. Just the routine things I have to do every day, from wiping medicine bottles, disinfecting, preparing the medicine to be used every day, and sorting out the examination room and medical records, take up an hour or two. Often, by 8:00 a.m., patients have come to see the doctor, and our work is not fully prepared. So we have to use the nurse's skill of lying to people, and lie to the patients, "Please wait a moment, the doctor will come soon." In fact, the doctor only comes when we ask him to come. Sometimes our work takes a long time to finish, and we are afraid that the patients will be impatient and anxious, so we have to use the same tone to coax the patients again. When we have finished this part of our work, the clinic is always full of patients. At this time, we are happy to use nice words to tell the patients, "What, the doctor hasn't come yet? Let me call him." The patient usually replies "Thank you!" to express thanks.</p>
<p>The doctor is called, and we have to do the work of the doctor's assistant. We pay attention at all times, and send up whatever the doctor needs, and we have to be quick and agile. In the summer, if the doctor's hands are disinfected, we have to wipe the sweat from his face for him. I have also done this work under the guidance of senior students. In the first few days, I felt that this work was too vulgar. It was as if we were female servants who were called to do rough work by the hospital in a brothel. In fact, we are not even as good as them. They still have three or four yuan in wages every month, but we have to give money to the hospital. Of course, the hospital also says it sounds nice: free learning, only charge for food. But what do we really learn? Originally, there is one hour a day to read books, but in fact, we only have one or two hours of classes a week at most.</p>
<p>One day, my work was particularly busy, and I hardly rested all day, and the doctor was very greedy for playing, and when he had a little free time, he disappeared. One wanted to see the doctor, and the other wanted to see the doctor, so we looked for the doctor everywhere. It was tiring enough to find him, let alone do things! When I returned to the dormitory and talked to my classmates about this, my classmate Ms. Li heard and said, "It's considered that you are doing the most pleasant job in the ENT department, and there are no extremely dirty patients. It's the hardest for me to do in the ward. I didn't rest at all last night, all of them were seriously ill. This place wasn't busy, and then the doorbell rang again. Patient No. 20 is the worst, ringing the doorbell for no reason. When I went, he said: He was very lonely and wanted us to relieve his boredom. This kind of person simply regards our nurses as a pastime. It's really irritating - and there are the lying-in woman of No. 30 and the syphilis patient of No. 16, which are extremely annoying, ringing the doorbell all the time, and it's so troublesome to go, wanting this and that, and being busy endlessly. That syphilis patient is already in his forties, and always wants to tell us jokes. If we don't perfunctorily him, then he will tell the head nurse, saying that a certain nurse is not good, and so on. So we will inevitably be given a demerit. Gu and Wang are examples, so we have to perfunctorily him a few words. But his affairs are really troublesome enough, what: 'Today's medicine is not comfortable, can you change it for me?' I often have to change it for him, but it's really embarrassing to apply medicine for him."</p>
<p>"You haven't done surgery yet." Zhao Xiangzhen said to me, "Those patients with rotten heads and feet are dirty and smelly, but we have to wash the pus from these patients. Sometimes we are a little careless, and we touch our faces with our unsterilized hands after washing the rotten things, and we may get the same sores."</p>
